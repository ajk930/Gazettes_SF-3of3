ROME, Oct. 15.â 1n connection with the
alleged revelations regarding' the events
which preceded the resignation of the
French Minister, M. Delcasse. thÂ« follow
ing- pemi-official communication has been
issued here:
"The action taken by Italy at Paris.
London and Berlin in connection with the
Moroccan affair was absolutely friendly
end conciliatory and in the interests of
peace. The action was not fruitless, as
owing to it Franco accepted the confer
ence propoFcd by Germany whirh the for-
ESer originally oppoppd, while Italy wa.<
abl^ to induce Icrmany :o agree to the
fundamental conditions claimed to b<* di.=
cuf-sed by the conference. Foreign Mm
Tlttoni communicated this to. M.
iiarrere, the Frenoh Ambassador To Italy.
ar,d nothing el^e."
It Is also understood that the Italian
Government will continue to use Its influ
ence, at Paris and Boriin for an undcr
etanding between France and Germany.
The relations between Itaiy and France
continue t<Â» be. most friendly, thf French
Government having- emphatically denied
a fpeech attributed to F'remier Bouv : ier
v.hii-h was cmit-Mered disre^pcftful to
\u25a0^\u25a0ard Itaiy. Indr*rd. ;is one evidence of
these grood relations, France will send a
rsaval squadron to Genoa to greet King
Victor Emmanuel, who is going there Oc
tober 28. to Inaugurate the new harbor
works.

Vrrlinz. Against Knu'siiid .Notv at
Dulfinc Point.
LONDu.V, Oct. J5. â Dolcasse's revcla- ;
tions of the British offt-r to back
France in a war with German J' have
created a very ugly European situa
tion. That Delcasse was the. real
*uthor of the Paris Matin s story there
Is no doubt, and the belief that he was
destroys at one blow all his reputation
tor the future as a politician.
The already sufficiently bitter an
tipathy between England and Germany
has beÂ«n stirred to the boiling point.
Germany sees in England's uudenied
effer of contingent support of France
. a. verification of her fears of English
*;ingo desire for an opportunity to de
etroy her fleet. Lansdowne's diplo-.
matic denial' makes it clear that such
contingent support was- offered.
Moreover, it is recalled that last
winter Captain Arthur Lee, M. P., Civil
Lord of the Admiralty, made a speech
to his constituents, declaring- that the
entire stragctic resources of the ad
miralty wero directed toward providing
against hostilities with Germany.
More sSgmfnV.ant still, however. Is the
fact that the English army maneuvers
this summer were carried out on a
scheme of concentration at Hull, the
port from which, according to a French
Ftatement, v descent was to be made
on Sohleswig-Holstein. â¢
Ttf Is realized that this exceedingly
jrravc series of discoveries Is likely to
loud to unpleasant. If not dangerous,
developments.

Special L>:*patch to The Call
LONDON, Oct. Ij.â lt has just beta an
nounced that the row of cottages built by
Peg \Voflsngton as almshouses are to be
sold. That means they art doomed. They
will probably pass into the hands of some
enterprising builder who will demolish
them to make room for more prete&tioui
dwellings. To ail who are familiar with
the story of the famous actress there is
something peculiarly pathetic in iheir
Ircper.dinjj destruction*
â¢â¢Alas:" said PÂ«.g to her sister, nfter
learning from th< doctor that a fatal
taalady l-.a-i pelzed upon iur, "I bad 'lone
mure harm than I cou'.d ever hope to do
good now. and my io:ig life of folly and
\u25a0wickedness will be rrmembertdâ will b
wl>at they call famous; my short life of
repentance who will know or heed or
take to profit?"
These picture syutly simple cottages
have long constituted a monument to thc
meniojy of th:;t Uiief and better life In
which this beautiful and brilliant woman
6ought to atone for her frailties by acts
of charity and piety. Her numerous the
atrical triumphs are recorded in various
histories of the English stage. Her many
amours, too, are often mentioned in these
old chronicles and fre-qu*nt references to
them occur in descriptions of early eight
eenth century life. Of the story of her
life in retirement at Teddington. dt voted
to good deeds, little survives. Her alms
houses were occupied as such only for a
ehort time. Most of their present tenants
- â humble working' folk who grumble
much at the rents, they hav# to pay â
have never even Jicu.ro of her. But as
long as thoy M^nd. to those oT an in
quiring fjrn they iitford indubitable
evidence cf the. "genuineness of poor
1-Vg's re'pentai'ce and conversion. With
their Â«lestrnÂ«-tion there will remaiii
nothing to reral! that side of her life.
CAREER OK THE ACTRESS.
No actress ever nad less of a chance
to become a shining example of feminine
propriety than Ptg Worrington. Birth,
environment, the fatal gift of beauty â
everything was against her. Her father,
a journeyman bricklayer of Dublin, re
ceived a pauper's burial, leaving his
â¢widow to struggle against a load of debt
with two little girls to support, of whom
Peg, then 2 years old. was the elder. She
made her debut on the stage â if such it
can be calledâ when she was still an in
fant. Madame Violas***, a Frenchwoman,
was running what would now be called
a variety show. One of her acts was a
tightrope performance In which she car
ried a baby in a basket. Peg was the
baby. The show did not pay and Peg's
life was not long- thus imperiled. Mrs.
Woffington hawked fruits and vegetables
for -, a-, living, and Peg, as soon as she
uasÂ£sÂ£lÂ«.io toddle, helped Jier. Her fa
vorftethaunt was the theater, where she
fold oranges. When she was 10 the en
terprising Madame Violante started a
Lilliputian cor-i^auy and Peg was en
gp.Â«jftd to play "Polly" in the "Beggar's
Opera.". â¢ , \u25a0
Her extraordinary talents enabled her to
overcome all educational defects and her
success : . v-as';, phenomenally rapid. The
beauty, wivv yivueity :md high spirits of
the untutored Irish girl brought all Lon
don to hor lo<-t. .She was certainly the
loveliest woman at that time on the
si&ge.
"She had." wrote Charles Reade, in his
dramatic story of which she is the hero
ine, "a head of beautiful form, perched
like a bird upon a throat massive, but
shapely and smooth like a column of ala
baster, a symmetrical . brow, black eyes
full of firÂ« and tenderness, a delicate
mouth, with a hundred varying expres
sions, and that marvelous faculty of giv
ing beauty alike to love or scorn, a sneer
or a smile. In person she was consid
erably above middle height, and so finely
formed that one could not determine the
ex&ct character of her figrure. At one
time she seemed all 'stateliness, at an
other time elegance personified, and flaw
i!ig voluptuousness at another. She was
Juno, Psycho. Hebe by turns, and. for
anight we know, at will."
Those were the days when it was taken
for granted that an actress had no repu
tation to lose. Peg Woffington was never
a hypocrite. And if she greatly needed
it she certainly possessed that virtue
â¢which is credited with great capacity for
covering sins. She made her mother an
allowance which relieved her of all ne
cessity of wrri-Uig for a living. She had
her sister carefully educated. To stage
folk" in luck she was always most
generous. She never forgot a kindness
done to her in ncr own early days of
poverty and hardship. None who had
oefriended her when she was an orange
girl in Dublin appealed in vain to her for
assistance. She made no parade of her
charities. She frequently slipped away
from some KokjiC of gayety to do some
kind deed by stealth.
MEX ItAVED OVER HER BEAUTY.
Of her -great talents and versatility as
an actress, contemporary reports admit of
no tfoubt. Her repertoire was an exten
â¢stvÂ« one. In "breeches" parts, as male
roles, when personified by a woman were
ihen termed, she excelled. She played Sir
Harry r Wildair so much better than 'Da
vid Garrick that he abandoned that char
acter. In the zenith of her London fame
she accepted an engagement with Mr.
Sheridan at a big salary for those days
and returned to Dublin. The men went
\u25a0wild over the beautiful woman who, as
a little, barefooted ragged girl there had
often carried a pitcher on her head down
to the Liffey. In that wittiest of cities
her wit was a match for the best. She
was lionized in dramatic, political and lit
erary circles. But the Dublin ladles said
that she was n. naughty woman and re
fused to associate with her. She retorted
that they could converse on only two
topicsâ silks and scandalâ and were intel
lectually her Inferior. They made things
unpleasant for her in Dublin and she re
turned to London. There something hap
pened that transformed her whole life.
This is Charles Reade's description of it:
"Xot long after. It so happened that she
went into a small church In the city one
Sunday afternoon. The preacher was
such as we have often heard; but not so
this poor woman in her day of sapless
theology, ere John Wesley waked the
snoring church. Instead of sending a dry
clatter of morality about the-ir ears, or
evaporating the Bible in the thin gener
alities of the pulpit, this man drove
God's truths home to the hearts of men
and women. In hifc hands the divine
virtues were thunderbolts, not swan's
down. With good sense, plain speaking
and a heart yeaning for the souls of his
brethren and his sieters, he stormed the
bosoms of many; and this afternoon, as
he reasoned like Paul of righteousness,
temperance and judgment to come, sin
ners trembled; and Margaret Wofllngton
was of those who trembled.
"After this she came often to the nar
row street where shone this house of
Go<s. and still new light burst upon her
heart and conscience. Here she learned

"This strong and straightforward char-,
acter made . no attempt to reconcile two
things that an average Christian- would
have continued to reconcile. Her interest
fell in a moment before her new sense
of right. She flung her profession from
her like a poisonous seed. It was in the
zenith of her charms and her fame that
she went home one night, after a .play,
and never entered a theater by front door
or back door again. She declined all
leave-taking and ceremony."
It was at Teddington, some eighteen
miles from London, and one of the most
picturesque of the towns that border the
Thames, that she retired to live her new
life. Never a spendthriftâ some of her
relatives said she was downright stingy
âshe had saved enough from her profes
sional earnings to supply her own sim
ple wants and enable her to devote herself
to the poor and needy. Ignored by the
gay world that had toasted and feted
the dashing actress, her. doings were no
longer chronicled. But one story that
has been preserved shows what manner
of life she lived at Teddington. An old
admirer met her, clad in an old black
silk gown and gray shawl, and carrying
a large basket on her arm. It was filled
with worsted stockings which she had
knitted and was taking to some of her
dependents. The gentleman said he
thought she was wasting valuable time
over such work and had better buy the
stockings.
"You can't buy them," was the answer.
"Nobody in this wretched town can knit
hose except Woffington."
She was still young and beautiful and
had confidently counted on devoting to
charity as many years as she had to -the
stage. But It was not to be. Certain
unpleasant symptoms to which she had
paid little attention in the excitement of
theatrical life, she could no longer ig
nore. She called In Dr. Bowlder, a fa
mous physician who had been an admirer,
of hers in the old days. He saw that she
was doomed. Wishing to spare her feel
ings, hie called for pen and paper under
the pretense that he intended writing her
a prescription. But what he wrote was
a note to an intimate friend of hers,
asking him to break the dire intelligence
to her by degrees, "with care and ten
derness." adding that it was "all we can
do for her."
HEADS HER OWX DEATH WARRANT \
Glancing over his shoulder, Peg read
her death warrant. Only one little gasp
ing sigh broke from her. It was the doc
tor who was overcome by the discovery
that she had learned the ghastly truth.
She banded him a glass of wine and told
him not to grieve for her. She lived
three years longer, and while strength
remained in her still busied . herself
with deeds of charity and went about
her work smiling and cheerfully. Un
der the chancel of the old parish
church at Teddington, opposite which
she had built her almshouses, she was
buried. On the wall just above the
little pulpit is a tablet with this simple
inscription:
"N*ar this Monument lies the Body of
Margaret Woffington, Spinster, Born Oc

MURDERER
Police Think Milton Frank
lin Andrews, Slayer of
Bessie Bouton, Is Still
Concealed in This City
LEE MAKES KNOWN
ADDITIONAL FACTS
Siiys Afteiv^ Colorado Crime
- Man Sought' For Hid in
Denver and. Escaped Fin
i ally,' oh Vancouver \ Ship
The. hunt for Mil ton. Franklin Andrews,"
slayer of Bessie Bouton in Denver, last
October, has put the San.^Francisco po
lice force on its mettle and there is a
determination that' the celebrated criminal
shall not escape from this city. /
That he is still in San Francisco, , the
lecal detectives have little doubt. Driven
like a beast of. prey to its lair, the
woman-slayer and j world-noted crook Is
ccwering in silence, Waiting , until the
ferret eyes of the hoverins hawks of the
law shall grow less keert in iheir search,
vhen he hopes to scuttle away in â¢ the
night and lose himself again in the -great
covert furnished by a distant country.
The police have compared Andrews' un
derclothing with that of the thug who
was killed by 'Policeman Lestrange in
West Berkeley on September 28, in .con
nection with the theory that both An
drews and the dead thug were members
of a gang called; the Howard gang,
headed by Augustus Howard of Austra
lia. It is found that the underclothing is
almost identical- in" texture, weave and
marks of manufactory, ' both sets being
apparently of Australian manufacture.
The sensation caused by Lee's yarn of
the alleged attempt to : kill him for his
money in the Berkeley, -cottage has be
come a secondary one after the great ex
citement produced by the sudden appear
ance and feverish pursuit of the. notori
ous murderer, who has flashed into view
like a maii-eatihg shark from afar and
shot back into ocean's deptns, with the po
lice watching vainly for a chance to use
their nets. -Excitement has been caused
in Denver, too, -and many, messages are
flashed back and forth between the heads
of the police .departments of the^-two
cities. â¢ \u25a0-
ESCAPE SEEMS IMPOSSIBLE.
If Andrews really is in this city, it
seems almost Impossible for him to es
cape,' There is $2000 waiting for any one
who will turn him over to the officers of
justice. This bait makes his position an
unsafe one, even If he -is shielded by
some of his own ilk, as it is supposed he
is?. There may be honor among thieves,
ft>Uk r criminals who ithlak&MtJJe of killing
JttfjSÃlldw being forV^t^tless than $2000
may-hot hesitate to inform even on one
or their own' 1 - f on that amount.
Besides the sharp glances of the detec
tives and several hundred -policemen, the
eyes of thousands pi fother*. citizens are
strained ; "in -ther. hopes -; of ' \u25a0'.- catching j a
glimpse ; of ' Andrews. It' looks as if a
hand from. somewhere will surely stretch
out -to' apprehend him' the minute he
breaks from cover. " . \
Of such unusual appearance is Bessie
Bouton's murderer that he cannot slip
away easily . and lose himself among a
crowd of his fellow men. His six feet
three Inches of height, his skeleton slen
derness, the fact that he walks pigeon
toed and the perceptible scar on his
cheek make his detection a matter of
ease, should he appear on the street now.
Andrews isn't likely to appear,
thougu, when so many thousands of
eyes are watching for him, when every
man who looks like a rail and who
has a fad for eating prepared cereal
foods is inspected thoroughly 'by ama
teur sleuths with a vision of $2000
easily earned before them. The police
deem it certain that* he is being con
cealed in a room somewhere until he
can grow a beard and until he thinks
the excitement caused by. the sudden
appearance of Bessie Bouton's slayer
in San Francisco has subsided. It was
by such concealment for a time that
he managed to escape from Denver
after his atrocious crime in Colorado.
aiAN'Y EYES ARE WATCHING.
How keenly Andrews is being
watched for is shown by the number
of reports sent to Acting Captain of
Detectives Reynolds by, persons who
think they have seen the ' murderer.
One of these came from a grocery store
on Van Ness avenue, where a man re
sembling Andrews' had "been calling for
a few days and buying breakfast foods.
Detectives Braig and Egan traced this
man to his room and saw he was not
Andrews. Clifford dv Jardin,' driver of
a grocery wagon, reported seeing a
man answering ' Andrews' description
near the Vallejo-street dock Saturday
morning, looking for the steamer Au
relia, due to sail that day for Eureka.
This man wore corduroy trousers
tucked into hunting boots. ; Dandy,
though he is, Andrews will doubtless
array himself In rough clothes when he
â¢tries tornake his escape.'
Many others have, sent in reports of
having seen Andrews. ' All these re
ports have been faithfully investigated
by the detectives.' Some of the persons
taken for the murderer have been ri
diculously different from' him and some
have come close to the description.
William Lee. or Ellis, who had the
fight wi,th Andrews that nearly led to
Lee's death in the Berkeley house over
the division of the : spoils .of an Aus
tralian burglary, giVesf.a little . more
information of valu"e : each' day. He
says now .that the' woman who came
here with j Andrews and himself from
Australia was' the murderer's compan
ion at the time he killed^Bessle Bou
ton andthajt she concealed him for two
months in Denver until Uhe excitement
had subsided. Then he made his way
to Victoria and escaped to Australia
on the steamship \ Miowera. ' It . is "sus
pected that this' woman has secured a
room and is concealing' the' murAjrer
here: She could . mingle with the
throngs on the street and : escape de
tection.

Harvester Trust to Be Spared.
LONDON, Oct. 16. â The correspond
ent of the Times at Wellington; New

of the farmers and the country mem
bers will prevent any legislation dur
ing the present session of the New Zea

harvester "trust"
years ago, resulting in a rich haul.
Lee has also admitted to the .police
that he was expelled from the National
Sporting Club of .Sydney for . "welch

Australia with Andrews close upon
the heels of that eventt.
Frank Hardy, quartermaster of the

said that, upon fleeing from Australia
Lee went to New Zealand .with An

English Public Desires That
Irving's Body Should Be
Placed in Westminster
REGRET IS WIDESPREAD
King Edward and President
; Roosevelt Send Messages
Following Actor's Death
I -LONDON, Oct. 16.â That the body of Sir
Henry Irving should find a resting place
in Westminster Abbey appears to be a
very, general -desire. An editorial in this
morning's Daily Telegraph says :
\u25a0 : "The nation will, . we are persuaded to
believe,- ask- this .honor for him with no
uncertain .voice,, and' we know we inter
pret the 'wish arid ; feeling of the country
when we. plead for a. public interment in
the Abbey.',' :. "â¢;,>. ]
; The flood of tributes of admiration and
affection is increasing. From King Ed
ward "downward, : men of all classes,
including the great churchmen, are giv
ing 'public expression to their feelings on
the sad occasion,^ nearly all dwelling as
much on Sir" Henry ; Irving's personal
character as on his historic 'talents.
\u25a0 It seems to ; be beyond doubt that Ir
>ving sacrificed himself by. hard work. He
had been -advised a long time ago to
'give :dfc- arduous roles like that of Mat
â¢thias in "''The "Belles," owing to the strain
thrown 'on his _ weak heart, and only last
week 'he' was reluctantly persuaded to
omit "The Bells" in the future.
It- appears that' for several years past
the weakness of the lungs had thrown an
undue strain on the heart. Sir Charles
Wyndham says that In February last he
begged Sir, Henry to take warning and
not to burn the candle at- both ends with
receptions ' in the morning and exacting
performances in the evening.
*Â« Many interesting touches are revealed
in the tributes of Sir Henry's friends.
For , instances, 'Forbes Robertson says
that Sir Henry told him it was his finan
cial successes in the United States that
enabled him to create his success at the
Lyceum Theater in London.
General Booth, of , the Salvation Army,
J. L. Toole,,the actor, and Sir Theodore
Martin, were among the veterans who
hastened to express the extent of the
loss the world has sustained in the death
of Irving.
Nothing, has yet been decided aa to the
funeral arrangements pending the meet
ing of the theatrical managers which Sir
Charles Wyndham has called for to-day
and which probably will decide to ask
the dean of Westminster Abbey to per
mit interment in. the Abbey.
. .King Edward and Queen Alexandra
through Sir. General Brighton McNaugh
ton Probyn, keeper of the privy purse and
extra equerry to the King, yesterday sent
a message of sympatny to the family of
Sir Henry Irving in which their Majesties
say:
"He will indeed be a great loss to the
profession of which he was such a dis
tinguished member."
Messages of sympathy have also been
received from President Roosavelt, and
Dr. Jules Clarettie on behalf of the
"Coniedie Francals.. \u0084_\u25a0

activity of the founders of the Jesuit or

and subsequent triumphs which attended
their labors for the spreaa of snlntual
and educational advancement in the
community.
Father Cummins said in part:
% The labors of the Jesuits in Lower Califor
nia from the year 1683 to llfii. when they j
were txf*-l!ed by order of the Spanish monarchal
were most successful.
Father Kino was the founder of the missions j
in the j.eninsula. He was succeeded by Father j
SaJvatierra, and their labors resulted in the
establishment or a chain of missions extend- ,
ing along the Gulf of California for nearly
one' thousand mile*.
WOIIK OV THE MISSION'S.
On their expulsion the work of the mission!
was taken up by the Franciscan Fathers, who
within a. few yeare extended them into upper
California as far north as the bay of San
Francisco.
The Josuits were eeen no more on the west
ern coast of North America until the days of
Father De Â£met, who in 1844 arrived at Fort
Vancom-cr. bringing with him several com
panions, among them Fathers Michael Accoltl
and John de Nobili. who five years later began
work In San Francisco.
They were obliged to leave the following
year, and it was only In 1554 that the definite
beginning of a Jesuit foundation was made in
San Francisco.
In that year, on November 1. Father An
thony Maraschl arrived in San Francisco, ac
companied by Fathere Messea and Masnata.
Early the following year, in a little depression
among the Band hill* west of Kearny and
Third 6treets, Father Maraschl began work on |
the first Church of Et. Ignatius, which was i
dedicated July 15 of that came year. Three
months later he opened the doore of St. Igna
tius Ac&dcmy.
This great church and the noble college ad
jclnlng are the outcome of that humble be
ginning.
In 1880, under the direction of Father AJoy
clue Vanl, this magnificent temple was opened'
for the worship of God. and the adjoining !
buildings were taken posseeesion of by priests i
end Btudentf. And here now for twenty-five
years In church and college the fathers of
k'r.e Society of Jesus have been doing work
' r.'orthy cf the best days of their history.

BIG INTEREST
IN OLD SIGN
Fact That Charles Dickens
Used to Speak of It Has
Turned Attention to It
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON', Oct. 15.â Dickens lovers have
to thank that tireless authority on"'Boz,"
Percy Fitzgerald, for pointing out that a
curious old sign which was an unfailing
object of interest to Dickens as a boy,
and to which he often referred in later
years still hangs in the Blackfriars, road
of London. This sign, which advertises a
long established- hardware firm, is a
typical' example of the queer trade em
blems which from the sixteenth century
distinguished practicably every shop of
any importance in the metropolis, but of
which few specimens now exist. It rep
resents a gold dog apparently licking
something out of an overturned crock or
pot and is generally referred to as "The
Sign of the Dog and the' Pot." Dickens
evidently first discovered It In, as Fitz-
I gerald says, "those heartrending blacking
days in Warren & Co.'s factory, when the
poor lad distracted his cares by noting all
the odd things that met his eye." And
I he quous the novelist as saying, of that
\u25a0 time, "My usual way homeâ that is to
Lant street, where he had a lodging so as
to be nearer his family in the Marshalsea
prisonâ was over Blackfriars bridge and
down that turning in the Blackfriars
road which has Rowland Hill's chapel on
one side and the likeness of a golden dog
licking a golden pot over a shop door on
the other."
Fitzgerald adds: "When the little Boz
saw it first it must have been about the
twenties-1523 or 1824-and the dog has
licked on ever since to this year of grace
1905. 1 should say there is no memorial
of this kind at all associated with Boz
that has stood in its place so long and so
undisturbed. I always wonder how It can
have escaped, for some serious, pragmati
cal shopkeeper might have thought it a
i grotesque hindrance to his business."
i: It apepars. however, that the "iron
mongers" who own the sign, far from
being "problematical" are decjdely proud
of it. and perhaps future American vis
itors may find interest in this relic of for-"
mer days which is so closely associated
with Dickens.
According to his friend Theodore Watts-
Diinton, Algernon Swinburne's magnus
; opus as a prose writer is still, to come,
but will appear before many days. "The
story of the inception and progress of
the book" says Watts-Dunton in the cur
rent British Weekly, "is a very interest
ing one and shows, as far as the. mere
conscientiousness of the literary artist
goes, that Mr. Swinburne has never been
surpassed by any writer. .Many years
agoâ more than thirtyâ Mr. Swinburne de
termined to write an exhaustive book
upon the Elizabethan dramatists. Long
before he eet pen to paper upon this sub-
I Ject his knowledge of it was probably
greater than that of any man of his time.
It is doubtful, indeed, whether, interesting
and important as the subject Is, it Is quite I
worth the time and pains which Mr.
Swinburne, whose position is 'so grffet as!
an original writer, has devoted to it. '
"The book has be*n close upon comple
tion for years, and Mr. Swinburne was
only waiting in the hope that Mr. Bullen
.(the London publisher) would complete
his services to students by bringing out
a collection of Rowley's works. Year af
ter year went on and Mr. Bullen has not j
yet seen his way to doing the world this
literary service. Therefore It was net^s- '
sary for the two quarto plays of- Row- I
ley's which Mr. Swinburne had not read,
to be studied in the British . Museum! |
But during this time Mr. Swinburne had !
come to share Carlyle's dislike of reading I
in the British Museum, and his friends |
could neither persuade him to go and
read Rowley's uncollected quartos jior
yet persuade him to leave these plays
untouched and to give the world his
study of Rowley as far he he knew him.
"At last, however, he was persuaded by
a friend to go to the British Museum.
The result was that they went and he
who had never been seen In the museum
for a quarter of a century was seen there
again 'bending over. Rowley's 'quartos and
making extracts. The interesting feature
connected with this story is that a writer
allowed a mass of work, to which- he
had given a considerable portion of. his
life, to remain scattered and lost 'in
magazines for the sake of about ten
pages. This shows two things: An amaz-

ing strength of the artistic conscience
and an amazing faith that time would al
low him to take nearly forty years over
a book. It is almost as . remarkable as
the fact that Goethe completed his Faust
in his eightieth year."
"Zola is a drug on the marketâ his
books do not sell at all now." This state
ment would have been somewhat sur
prising if made by an American or Eng
lish book-seller, but It came as rather a
shock from the head of one of the-big
gest "libraries" " in Paris. And .he went
on: "Bourget's popularity is not what.it
was. Anatole France and Pierre Loti are
always in demand, especially, the latter,
but It is now two : comparatively,; new
women writers who command the-larg
est publicâ Miriam Harry and Marcelle
Tlnayre." These are the authors, re
spectively, of "The Conquest of Jerusa
lem" and "The House of Sin," both ; of
which were really remarkable works.
"Flaubert," the book-seller went on, "is
as much, perhaps more, read than ever.
Of foreign authors â¢ translated into
French, H. G. Wells is easily the most
popular."
The Paris Matin Is trying to locate a
man from whom it received, a truly
astonishing proposition the Â©"ther. day,
with the object of dissuading him from
committing suicide. If 6ucceessful the
newspaper should add him to its staff,
for evidently he has the, true; journal
istic instinct â be he hero, as would ap
pear, or faker, as is half suspected. In
his communication to the Matin, which
was signed A. B, A., with a postofflce
address, the writer expressed his inten
tion of committing suicide; and offered
before he did so to write a series of
articles describing the state of mind
of a man .who intends to' take his own
life. The last article, he says, he will
call "To-Morrow !\u25a0 Shall' Die," and when
it is written he will kill himself. The
first article will describe his state of
mind when he returned home one even
ing and found .that his wife had left
him and taken their" child. Another
will describe his ' search, another will
generalize on "Woman," her Love and
Hate." The fifth will describe the
choice of ways of committing \u25a0 suicide
and the sixth the" preparations. .He
asks the Matin to invest the sum it
would pay for, the .'articles andlet> it
accumulate until his son is 21 years old.
"If you will agree tq^this," he con
cludes. "I shall have done at least one
good thing in taking my life"

FOUND UNCLAD
ON FREIGHT CAR
New York Clubman's Eiiason

Special Dispatch to The Call.
YONKERS. N. V.. Oct. 15.â Dr. Arthur
St. Clair Knudson, a prominent member
of the City, Harvard and "Seawanhaka
Yacht clubs of New York, was found on
top of a freight car here this morning,
unclad and so dazed that he .did not know
where he was. He was turned over; to
the police and was hurried to the St.
Joseph's Hospital,/ where he. soon revived
under treatment.
Dr. Knudson's story_ was very disjoint
ed, but from various fragments it was
learned that last night â¢he dined at the
City Club with some friends. Leaving
there he walked up' Broadway, when a
feeling , of extreme : fear overtook him. He
took a cab and rode to One Hundred and
Fifty-fifth street, where," he says, he took
a train for Highbridge.; There ;he took
to the -road and ran. Feeling, that his
clothing was oppressing him and holding
him' back, he says, he removed -it and
started ;' to climb over.,- a freight train.
Tkat'was the last he: rememberedy until
he"i was revived : at ; the hospital.^ ; -

LONDONERS FIND
HOUSE OF MIRTH
Mark With Memorial Tablet
Old, Plain Brick Home in
Which Sydney Smith Lived
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON. Oct. 15.â Onec a week, behind
the closed shutters of a severely plain
brick house, which the London County
Council has just marked with a memorial
tablet, was probably heard more merry
laughter than In any, other residence; in
the whole city. Those were the days
when Sydney Smith lived at the house in
question, 14 Doughty street, and \u25a0 gave
a \u25a0 weekly supper party there to his
friends, as had been his custom in Edin
burgh.
Yet those early days in Doughty, street
were, according to his daughter, a time
of "considerable anxiety and a severe and
courageous struggle against poverty." It
was in 1803 that the famous wit and
author took up his residence there, but
two years elapsed before he could obtain
any appointment as a preacher. To keep
the -family pot boiling and maintain the
merry'supper parties during that period
Mrs. Smith sacrificed some valuable
pearls which had been bequeathed to her,
selling them for : $2500.
Through the influence of Sir Thomas
Bernard, Smith obtained in March, 1806,
the post of alternate evening preacher
at the Foundling Hospital. The stipend
wa3 only $250, per annum, but he soon
managed to earn as much more by
preaching on alternate Sunday mornings
at Berkeley "Chapel and at Fitzroy
Chapel.
The turning point in nis fortunes came
with his appointment to deliver a course
of lectures at the Royal Institution. \u25a0He
was paid J250 for the series. Their suc
cess brought: nim an' Invitation to con
tinue lecturing, and s for the second set
ho received $600.
In 1S06" he had* attained to such pros
perity that he felt justified in removing
to < a "bigger house on Orchard street
which ..; has !\u25a0 since . been destroyed. The
Doughty-street house Is now a boarding
house like most of the houses in the
Bloomsbury
Once,* when speaking of his own strug
gles against poverty; he remarked, "The
observances oÂ£ the church concerning
feasts and fasts are tolerably well kept
;upon the: whole, .since the rich keep the
f easts and the" poor.' the, fasts.!*
"Thewhole^of .my life." he observed
on another^ occasion, "has passed â¢ like
a razorâ in hot .water, or. a' scrape."
In. his . old] age, ; when people inquired
after, his" health he frequently answered,
"I am tolerably, well, but intolerably
old."

GERMANS MITST PAT MORE

Beer and Cigars "Will BÂ« Taxed to
Provide Funds for Greater
Nary.
BERLIN, Oct. 13.â Germaaa are
threatened with an extra duty on their
two most cherished luxuries, their cigar
and their glass of beer. Baron yon
Stengel, the Imperial Minister of Fin
ance, says the exchequer is in a de
plorable condition and must be re
plenished at all coats.
Baron yon Stengel's greatest trouble
is how best to stop the mouth of the
admiralty with German gifts. The
Kaiser and his admirals are crying for
more ships, more big ships, and Insist
ing that these be'built at an accelerated
pace.
"Why cannot we build as fast as the
Americans," he asked Admiral Tlrpltz
the other day.
So Yon Stengel, driven from his last
refuge, has decided to tax cigars and
beer. He hopes to raise an extra 10.
000,000 sterling each year, about half
of which will go to shipbuilding.

SHARPERS VICTIMIZE
A FILIPINO STUDENT
Unpleasant End of
Gay Time in San
Francisco
Crooks Evade Trap
Set by Berkeley
Police.
BERKELEY, Oct. 15. â Frank Ramos,
a member of the Filipino student con
tingent, in the university town, resid
ing at 1944 Berkeley way. Informed,
the police to-day through his guardian, j
F. Legardo. that systematic attempts i
were being made by San Francisco
crooks to bleed him of money, alleged
to be due them as debts contracted
by Ramos in a gambling game in the
city. The crooks already have Be- â¢
oured from the Filipino lad his month- i
ly allowance of $75, and besides this |
money were in possession until this
afternoon of the lad' 6 diamond pin, his
gold watch and a promise on his part
to pay them $50.
The police were called in this aft
ernoon by Legardo, the Filipino's guar
dian, to assist in capturing and pun
ishing the men who were hounding the
Filipino student and attempting to ex
tort money from him. A trap was set
by Marshal Vollmer's men and Le
gardo to catch the crooks from San
Francisco, but the men scented the
game and the man most wanted es- *
taped. '
Ramos, a few days ago, Informed his
guardian, Mr. Legardo. that he had en
gaged in a pool game at the Belve
dere's annex on OFarrell street in the,
city and there persuaded to gamble
on the game. He won $195. Then he
lost that money and his allowance of
$75 in addition. The s/.rangers wfio
got his money had befuddled him with
drink' and after getting his coin led
him on until the Filipino lad owed
them $50. They demanded security for
ihis debt and took his diamond pin and
gold watch.
At Intervals since then the man who
was most urgent in asking for the
money from the boy and who gave his
name as Stanley and represented him
self to be the head of the clothing
department of the Emporium, came to
.Berkeley, demanding payment. ,
The boy was in great distress and
promised to get the money from Le
gardo, and to him related the circum
stances. Legardo set the trap for the
strangers, convinced that they were
crooks, ajid got Deputies Moran and
Farrar to co-operate with him this aft
ernoon, when the men were to come
over and get <the money.
Legardo lives at 1924 Oxford street.
He had Ramos detain the strangers
there when they arrived while he has
tened to the marshal's office and se
cured assistance. The suspicions of
the visitors were aroused and when
the officers returned the men had dis
appeared.
Search was made and one of the duo
was found, but no,t the man who had
cheated Ramos, as alleged. The
stranger was taken to Marshal Voll
mer'S office, where he denied any com
plicity in the affair. He did produce
Ramos' watch, however, and said his
name was Donovan, but as no charge
rould be made against him he was per
mitted to go.
Ramos' guardian will make every ef
fort to apprehend the men who fleeced
his charge, convinced that they are
crooks and deserving of a term be

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL.- MONDAY- OCTOBER; 16, 1905:
STUDENTS GET
"GOLD BRICK"
Wail Froiii Editor of the
Occident as Result of
Shrewd Business Scheme
FRICTION ON CAMPUS
Rally Committee Fears Its
. Attempt to Get Coin Is
to Prove a Flat Failure
BERKELEY, Oct. 15.â There is talk of
a "gold brick" which students have got i
as the result of friction at the State
University between the rally committee
and the managers of the various under
graduate publications'. It has arisen over
certain advertising privileges granted by
the latter for the purpose of supplying
to the committee funds for conducting
the football billies this ierm. The sit
uation is a novel one in the history of
student affairs, ,&nd neither one of the
contesting parties seems to be able to sug
gest an amicable settlement.
The trouble started some time ago,
when Joseph S. Koford, chairman of the
rally committee, approached the' man
agers and requested their .financial as
sistance. At first the latter did not fall
in with the ide.i, but later the committee
got a promise from the managers that
they would be allowed twenty-five dol
lars' worth of advertising space in the
various papers on condition that they
themselves would secure the ads. For
some time everything went well; the ad
vertisements began to come in and all
looked bright and rosy.
Last week in a conversation with the
managers concerning the final settlement
Koford was surprised to learn that the
rally committee was not to secure the
entire proceeds from, its work, but only
ihe 20 per cent commission allowed all
student solicitors. The students gajned
this impression of the status of the af
fair from an editorial 1 Chat appeared in
the last edition of the Occident, the col
lege weekly, of which Koford Is the ed
itor.
The editorial lealing with the subject
appears under the caption "Managerial
Tightness." The article severely arraigns
the managers for their parsimony and
bitterly attacks them for their harsh
treatment and lack of college spirit.- In
conclusion the elitorlal states:
â¢me limitations placed by the ' nianarcra In
connection with 'be securing of advertise
ments made the rally committee think that
it had gotten a gi Id brick. Nevertheless the
committee prepared to try Its best, realizing
that the money it spent was ; spent in a very
good cause. Mori over, the committee con
sidered that It hail achieved a great . victory,
because the consent .of the manager*, eucn
a 6 they ihad. was not obtained without con
siderable coaxing, begging, cajoling, etc. But,
wonder of wonder*, no sooner had the-com
mittee finished charting hands with Itself over
this diplomatic vii tory. whanâ the managers
â¢â¢got together." Vf ill. the result waa that the'
members of the cfmmlttee were offered" jtood
steady employment on the staffs of the papers
at what was cons dered a good commission.
Thus it ended.
Now. it seems to us that those managers
who persistently b lcked this little enterprise
lost a very good chance to do the students of
tnlsninlverslty a â¢.â¢ery'-.gopd jtuvn. and that,
too, without any freat inconvenience and no
expense. to themselves or papers.
BOOKS SOUGHT FOR.
IN BRITISH MUSEUM
Students Crowd Its Reading Rooms
and Investigate Various
S objects.
In the readinp-room of the British
Museum the dertks are crowded with
students all day long, and in addition to
the books of reference, some 20,000 in
number, which fill the open shelves of
the room, from 3000 to 4000 volumes
are given out every day. Theology in a
wide sense, including the Bible, biblical
literature, church history and works on
the religious rites and ceremonies of all
races and creeds, is easily at the head
of the list, with about 300 volumes.
Topography comes next, with about
twenty fewer, and of these books on
London amount to a quarter, books on
English topography to another quarter,
the other half being for the rest of the
world. History and biography tome
next, English history being mostly in
demand, and books on France and
the French provinces second.
Essays, criticisms and miscellaneous
literature take the fourth place and are
followed by fiction â not less than five
years old â moral philosophy, poetry and
the fine arts, the drama, law and phi
lology, political economy and so on
down to politics, mathematics and
chemistry, which have about forty vol
umes apiece, and lastly works on naval
and military subjects, which seldom
have more than three or four volumes
each. It is a curious list and throwsa
useful light on the sort of studies taken
up by the' readers in the museum.â

Tonics as Traps at Table.
This Is the time of year, when dinner
guests are struggling with the huge sil
ver tongs, : invented to lift asparagus
stalks from the serving dish to one's
plate. Those asparagus tongs are one of
the traps that lay in wait for the moderns
at table where one is never sure which
of the many curious forks one must use
for this gr that course. Such Inventions
by the silversmith were never so numer
ous as the spring. It is common* for the
giver of a wedding' present to have, to
explain "what this thing is for" to the
recipient. Some of the newest table trap
pings. Include an oyster fork that enables
the qualmish to cut a large oyster In half;
a new fish knife | with a place for the
bones in the handle (it used to be the
worst possible "form" to use a knife for
fish!); an entree spoon and fork com
bined, for dishes like lobster a la New
burg; and complicated looking pairs of
thimbles that you slip over the thumb and
forefinger to hold the leg of a bird. There
is only one merit in such things; they
"make table talk,"- for even a sophisticat
ed man is likely to be confronted by. some
contraption that absolutely will compel
him to seek Information from his hostess.

An Admiral Without a Cabin.
The Russian admiral who lost his life
in the recent naval battle was one of the
biggest officers In the ,navy. Folkersahm
the Great was the name by, which he was
known In the marine. .But, for all that,
he was one of the Jblliest of men, and
appreciated notfcingÂ«aa well as a- good
joke.' Some years ago he was nominated
to the command of a torpedo-boat; at
Cronstadt. but, j to his consternation, it
was found that the burly officer could not
possibly descend to the { cabin,, as \u25a0-. the
aperture was to 6 email to allow his : great
bulk to pass through.. .The matter'- was
communicated to the* admiralty, but for
some time they refused to regard it in
any other light ; than a.. Joke, and poor
Folkersahm was; thus forced to' pass his
nights on the deck as. best Tie could.- Ad
miral* Folkersahm was i a typical Russian
as far. as appearance went, . but.'he' did
not allow the attitude that his nation has
adopted toward this L country to; influence

PELICAN FLAPS
WINGS WITH JOY
Humorous Periodical at Uni
versity Makes First Ap
pearance on the Campus
HITS AT INSTRUCTORS
Captain Nance Again Comes
In for Jests, and Other
Faculty Men Are Favored
BERKELEY, Oct. 15â The "Pelican," S
the humorous publication of the under
graduates at the University of California,
hia.de its appearance on the campus
Saturday for the first time this semester.
The issue is an improvement over those
of last year both in quality and in size.
"The management has made a specialty
of cartoons and short, witty poems.
As usual, the faculty comes in for its
share of the "roasts" that are handed
out with every edition. Professor C. D.
yon Neumayer, ' instructor in elocution
and a leader in the dramatic association
at the university, is made the butt of
some severe joshing at the hands \ of
Walter de Leon, one of the editors of the
publication. The josh is in the form of .
an interview in which tne professor Is
niade to say some very foolish things.
Captain Nance and President Wheeler
are made the subject of. a cartoon by Ju- \
llus Klein. The drawing, which is in
two parts, represents the student bat
talions drilling in one portion and in th 6
other is a caricature of President Wheel
er receiving a bunch of greenbacks from
the Government. Under the cartoon is
the caption, "Drilling for Goldâ A Mining
Term." The faculty student affairs com
mittee also comes in for a few joshes.
Most of the other cartoons in, the paper
refer to the football situation at the .uni
versity.' By far the best bit of jvqjirk in
the book is a double page drawing by
Carl Hoffman, dealing with the subject
of freshman football teams.
In the editorial columns occasion is
taken to severely roast the "Californlan,"
the college daily, for the weakness of its
editor's stand in affairs affecting the un
dergraduates. "If a thing is worth prais
ing," says Pelly, "it is worth slapping it
on. If it is worth knocking, bring on
the club." . . . \u0084 .
The editor speaks regretrully of the
number of things handed in which are
plagiarized and' promises that hereafter
he will publish in red ink the names of
all those who "lean toward the deadly
parallel." Most of the articles in the
book are. illustrated by the staff and out
side artists. .
This year's staff of the "Pelican" con
sists of the following: Editors-in-chief,
Vance McClymonds, Sam Hellman and W.
R. Del Leon; assistants, Karl Hoffman,
Julius Klein, Harry Rogers, Gurden Ed
wards, E. J. Loeb and Warren Perry. The

MYSTIC DR AMA
BY M'LELLAN
Author of Leah Kleschna to
Put Forth a Play Under
Title "The Jury of Fate"
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, Oct. 16. â Just as every
actor wants to play "Hamlet," so it
seems to be the nurtured ambition of
every dramatist to write a "mystic"
play. Give your playwright just the
requisite amount of success and you
are pretty sure to have him bobbing
up with a big allegorical "drammer"
that has spooks or some other variety
of supernatural beings in its. leading
roles.
The latest to succumb is C. M. S.
McLellan. 'Frankly it seems a bit early
for this American dramatist . ito be
dabbling in the mystic, for though he
has the big success of "Leah- Kleschna"
to his credit, not to mention "The
Belle of New York," and though his
comedy, "On the Love Path," appears
to be catching on at the London Hay
market, he really has no license yet
to be putting big moral i lessons on the
stage.
But this Is what McLellan has at
tempted, tha^t is, if his forthcoming
play is accurately described. Its title
is a bit disquieting, "The Jury of
Fate," likewise the announcement that
it is "a drama In seven tableaux." But
that is not the worst, for we have it
on the dramatist's own authority that
<he figure of death appears in his play
on no less than three occasions. In
the piece he Is referred to as "the
stranger,", and his visitations are made
to our old acquaintance the shattered
rake who would like to live his life
over again and who makes a decidedly
worse Job of it on the second , trial. N
YOUNG IRVING TO HAVE PART. A
There is a beautiful heroine, toojiwho
Is to be '.'typical of all that is whole
some and In womanhood,"
while the, leading, male character is op
posed by ' another who is intended : to
represent "humart | power, industry and
self-restraint." So no one will needlto
betola the "The Jury of Fate" is; the
most ambitious work which its author
has yet attempted.
Perhaps McLellan really has got it
in' him to do this' sort of thing and
make it convincing. The Schuberts
evidently think uncommonly .well jof
his play, for! they are going; to glveit
in London | with the younger Irving,
who recently acted Hamlet, inthe, lead-
Ing role. .This will. follow, their produc
tion at the new Waldorf of Beyftrlein's
military play, ''Lights^ Out," which ;in
the United States , was _ called ."Taps."
In thin also H. B. Irving will appear. \u25a0
For the success of his play "On the
Love Path," McLellan has chiefly to
thank what seems to have been an aner
thought. His Irresponsibility in-. "The
Belle of New York," and | his seriousness
in "Leah, Kleschna ; tried to mix :in . the
new piece and that^is where the. after
thought , must have come : in. Apparently
the author set forth in his ; salad 'days
to * write a . machine-made }.\ melodrama,*
with somewhat , farcical comedy |to light
en it. But the. comedy.was so light and
the melodrama- so heavy ;\u25a0; that the two
couldn't' get together. \u25a0\u25a0;, Perhaps, the play
was : shelved,; then, : s untiL success in other,
directions brought the'auinor's work j into
demand and . he, hurriedly; developed ; the
fun . in his play '\u25a0 and '; shoved his villain
to . one side. That : fun,' in the hands : of
what might -almost ;beJcalled: an :; all-star
company^ at "the ' Haymarket Theater, . so
delights the audiencethat they, wait quite
patiently : while - the^villain gets
his "thankless â¢ part 'of ', the''b*usiriess "and

Vicious Great Dane Attacks

Is Beaten Off hy a Woman
BULLET KILLS ANIMAL
Mrs. L. M. Ritzau Saves Wal
ter Thumler From Jaws of
Ferocious Dog He Released
ALAMEDA, Oct. 15.â Walter Thumler,
nine years, of age. was attacked by a
ferocious Great Dane to-day at the
home of L. M. Ritzau, 833 Taylor ave
nue, and while the savage brute was
mangling his victim he was beaten off
by Mrs.~ L. M. Ritzau, whose attention
was attracted to the unequal â¢ conflict
by the screams of the child and the
snarls of the .vicious canine. The calves
of the lad's legs were ripped in several
places by the sharp teeth of .the fren
2ied beast and his left hip was likewise
gashed.
Young Thumler, whose home is in
San Francisco, was visiting at the
Ritzau residence. Making his way into
the rear yard he opened the door of
the kennel wherein the Great Dane
was confined. Immediately upon being
released the animal sprang at the
throat of the boy and bore him to the
ground, j There the brute repeatedly
sank his fangs into the little fellow's
body and desisted only when Mrs.
Ritzau hastened to the "child's rescue
arid flogged the canine. She then sum
moned her husband, L. M. Ritzau, the
band leader, . who ended the Great
Dane's life with a bullet.
Dr. A. A. Stafford dressed the wounds
of young Thumler and the patient was
taken to his home. in San Francisco.

"I came over here from America for

ception this evening it looks as if I'd stay

So said Willie Collier in response to the
continued applause of the first night audi
ence at the London production of "On the
Quiet." Augustus Thomas' anything-but
quiet farce is not particularly suited to
London tastes, and the last act with its
comic marriage service verges closely on
vulgarity, but Willie Collier has captured
the town and could make a success of
anything that gave scope for his skill in
fun-making. \u25a0 â¢ -,
Excepting James Welch there is scarce
ly an English cdirtedian who can be com
pared with him. One might have thought
that some St the more solemn of the Lon
don critics would assume a condescending
tone in writing of the agile and light
hearted Collier, but even so grave a stu
dent of the drama as W. L. Courtney,
who edits the Fortnightly Review and
presides over the destinies of a famous
old publishing house when he Isn't writing
criticisms f or the Telegraph, speaks of
the American comedian's work in the
highest terms.

Several Lots in Oakland

ACTIVITY IN BUILDING
More Than Seven Hundred
New Structures Are Erect
in Berkeley in Single Year
OAKLAND, - Oct. 15.â Few large/deals
in local real estate have marked the week
Just closed. ; the most Important transac
tions being the sales of a lot on the
northwest corner of Broadway and First
street for $27,000, another on the south
west corner of the cane streets for $15,
000, and 127 feet of the property known as
the "Willows." on the east side of Oak
street, at a "point opposite Fifteenth
street- The price paid in the latter case
has not been made public. Other note
worthy sales have been those of a lot at
the corner of Alice and First streets for
$10,500 and one on the north side of First
street, between Franklin and Webster
streetÃ, for $2500.
In all but the case of the Willows prop
erty, it is understood that the buyers In
tend to use the property purchased for
the erection of manufacturing plants.
While there have been no very large
sales of real estate. Alameda. County
dealers, almost to a man, report a large
number of sales of small residence prop
erty, and the most encouraging feature
of these sales is the fact that a large per
centage of the deals have been made by
non-residents of the county, demonstrat
ing that there is a steady inflow of out
side capital into this and the neighboring
cities.
Work has Just been commenced on a
handsome residence, which Is to be erect
ed on the northwest corner of Seventh
and Jefferson streets, for the Right Rev.
Archbishop R. W. Riordan. The records
of the Building Inspector's office show
that the new home , of the Archbishop,
when completed, wilt, cost $15,000.
There has been a large amount of build
ing in all parts of the county In the last
thirty days, but the town of Berkeley has
been the most favored In this respect,
many new homes having been erected in
the "college town" in, that time.
On September 1, 1904, an ordinance was
passed in Berkeley requiring the filing of
a notice with the Town Clerk upon the
beginning of work on any building erect
ed within the town' limits, and since the
passage of the ordinance 709 of these no
tices have been filed. These notices rep
resent the outlay of more than two mil
lion dollars for new buildings in Berkeley
in a little more than thirteen months.
By far the most important transaction
in Berkeley real estate in the last month
was the sale of the McDonough tract,
located on the southeast corner of Rus
sell and College avenues. The tract was
purchased by Harlow P. Bancroft of the
real estate firm of Holcomb, Breed &
Bancroft and the price paid is said to
have been $160,000. ' â¢
J. S. Myers of Oakland has just pur
chased the gore bounded by Grove street,
San Pablo avenue and Jones street
through the firm of H. B. Belden & Co.
The purchase price was $35,000. It Is said
that the purchaser will at once begin the
erection of a three-story building on the
property.
The West Coast Realty Company has
just opened a branch office in Fruitvale,
near Fruitvale station. This company
has the handling of several choice tracts
of Fruitvale property, and ( they intend
ultimately to make this ineir main office.
In order to be close to their largest In
terests.

estate dealer of Berkeley, has Just re
turned from a short vacation spent in So-,

CROP OF NEW WORDS
"* RECENTLY COINED
Wars Generally Bring: Into General Use
Many .\en Words and
Phrases.
The Russo-Japanese war Is making us
familiar with a host of tangled proper
names, such as Rojestvensky, Pobiedonos
seff, Petravalesk and Kniaz Potemkln,
but it has given our vernacular few, if
any, new words.
Most wars of the last century were far
more productive. The struggle in the
Crimea gave us "Sebastopol," a name In
common usage among small boys for
forty years, and abandoned within the
last decade because the thing it repre
sented ceased to exist. The South African
war. introduced us to "trek," "laager,"
"kopje" and "burgher," anfl we promptly
took them in our arms. The first is now
a familiar common noun, and the other
three, though less often used, are under
stood perfectly by the majority of Amer
icans.- The roots "rift" and "kloof" and
the word "rand" have found their way
into English via the dialect of Tommy At
kins, and several other Boer words have
obtained fairly regular naturalization pa
pers. . In much the same way the Spanish-
American war enriched our store of
word. "Machete" and "reconcentrado"
are two that seem likely to remain with
us. The Philippine insurrection has paid
its :dues with "bolo," "ladrone" and
"hike"â the first Malay, the second Span
ish' and the third of unknown parentage.
But, unlike . previous wars, the Russo-
Japanese fracas is giving us legal tender
of common speech very sparingly. We
have learned that "shima" is Japanese
for island and that "yang" Is Chinese for
river, but neither of these words has be
come even bad English. Of Russian words
we have : learned none but "ikon" and
"vodka."â Baltimore Herald.
Cnriousi Warning: to Women.
A few miles from Annan, in the world
famed burial ground of Spring Well,
celebrated in song and story in connection
with Ac tragic death of Fair Helen of
Klrkconnel Lea, there is tobe. seen still
in. a state of good preservation a curious
old tombstone, upon which is sculptured a
full-bust figure of a woman with a waist
that any lady in searc hof a slim figure
might well envy.
But this tombstone, writes a correspon
dent of the Dundee News, was not erected
to encourage vanity In the feminine. mind.
butÂ«for the purpose of warning ladies who
were inclined to indulge in tight lacing of
the "fate that awaits themâ as the -lady
over whose remains this unique tombstone
was erected ' had fallen a victim to this

SACRAMENTO, Oct. 15. The issuauoo
of Governor Pardeo's proclamation an
nouncing the names of corporations, do
mestic and foreign, that have not yet
compiled â¢Hitn tjja provisions of the cor
poration license law passed by the last
Legislature, has revived interest In the
requirements imposed by the law. The
law was recommended by Secretary of
State Curry, who found it necessary for
the expedition of the business of his of
fice to sort out and abandon the ar
ticles of incorporation of concerns that
are dead and forgotten, but that atili
ouniber tha archives and impose double
duties upon a portion of his office force.
Under the law each domestic corpora
tion is taxed $10 a year for a lioense en
titling it to do business under its
charter, and a like sum is exacted from
foreign corporations for permission to do
business in the State. In case the pro
visions of the law are not complied with
the domestic concerns forfeit their char
ters and the foreign concerns forfeit the
right to continue to do business In the
State. If the tax is not paid by the last
of August it becomes delinquent and a
penalty of 15 is added. This must be
paid within Eixty days after the issuance
by the Governor of a proclamation an
nouncing tha names of the concerns that
have not compiled with the provisions of
the law. The proclamation was issued
yesterday, and forfeiture will be due De
cember 13, unless in the meantime de
linquents shall have settled with the
State,
There are in the office of the Secretary
of State articles of incorporation of 43,
009 concerns. A notice was sent to each
of them, with a copy of the law Inclosed,
that the license tax \tfas due. About 20,
000 of these were returned, marked "not
delivered" indicating that the corpora
tions had died; 8609 corporations have
paid the license tax of '|10, and nearly a
thousand have paid the tax and the $5
penalty. A rough estimate places the
number of live corporations In the State
from lt',ooo to 20,000 and those that have
not yet responded are delinquent, and un
less they pay up by or on December 13,
they will forfeit the right to continue
business in the State as corporations.
Under the law the publication of the
Governor's proclamation in two newspa
papers was made mandatory, and Gover
nor Pardee named as such newspapers
the Sacramento Union and the Oakland
Enquirer. The publication in the Union
will be made to-morrow morning; In the
Enquirer to-morrow afternoon.

suffering from severe burns. has
brought suit against Dr. C. P. Thomas
for' 110.000 as the value 'of 160 inches
of skin which he says the doctor peeled
off of his legs while under chloroform.
Lovejoy asserts that it was' repre

only take from his thighs two or three
stripes, three or four inches long and
three-fourths of an inch wide. When
he got off the table he found that the
front of his legs between knee and
hip was stripped and it was ten days
before he could get out of the hospital.
Mr 3. Fred B. Searles, the original
victim, was burned in an accident. with
a lamp - at Lewlston, Idaho, and was
brought here to St. Luke's Hospital
for treatment. A number of Elks
volunteered to furnish particles of skin,
but Lovejoy proved such a promising
subject that while under chloroform he
was peeled for all the grafts necessary
except some supplied by Mrs. Searle's
husband and brother. The grafting
operation was successful, but the wo
man was so weakened from long ill

STOCKTON, Oct. 15.â This city has en
tered upon a discussion of a general
bonding proposition, having in view ex
tensive Improvements In the way of pub
lic workA It now looks as if a few
months hence voters wlll.be called upon
to pass on a proposal to issue bonds for
$1,000,000 or 51,500,000. Mayor â¢ Gardner
launched the question formally when a
few^days ago he named fifteen prominent
men, representing diversified interesta, to
serve as a commission to formulate estlA
mates and make definite recommenda
tions. The committed has already got
down to work.
A problem of foremost importance Is
that of sewerage. The city has outgrown
its present system, and great trouble Is
being experienced in providing carrying
capacity for the additions. Moreover, the
outfall sewer empties into the San Joa
quin River in direct violation of the
State law. Additional 5 fire protection,
more parks, a city hall and schoolhouses'
are among the improvements spoken of.
The city is responsible for several miles
of improved streets, which are now re
paired out of funds raised by direct tax
ation, Competent authorities declare that
unless provision is soon made for needed
work, not to mention the improvements
necessary to put the city In line with
other progressive communities. It will
mean a municipal tax rate of $2 on the
$100.
The movers in the bonding proposition
will proceed cautiously in formulating
the formal blanket proposal to be sub
mitted to the voters. There will be week
ly meetings in a public place, and every
citizen will be free to offer suggestions.
If It is found that any one Item is liable
to endanger the success of the others
embraced in the scheme. It will be elim
inated. A determined effort will be made
to formulate a bonding proposal that will
carry decisively.

CONSERVATISM IN BUSINESS RECOMMENDED.
WHILE die mercantile agencies, through their correspond
ents, continued to report expansion in trade last week, such
expansion was hardly borne out by a scrutiny of the differ
ent industries. In the first place, while the bank clearings exhibited
an increase over the corresponding week last year, the increase was
smaller than of late, being only 15.2 per cent. The aggregate clear
ings, however, showed a large volume of business, amounting to
Â£2,830,000.000. and Baltimore and New Orleans were the only large
cities exhibiting a decrease; but the gains of the other cities were
smaller than for some time. The failures, too. which for months
have been fewer than in 1964. changed about and were 214, against
208 in 1904.
There was also a decrease in the volume of railroad earnings,
the increase thus far in October being only .02 per cent, whereas for
months the percentage of gain over the previous year has ranged vi
the neighborhood of 6 per cent. Still, the railroads arc reporting
difficulty in handling ail the freight ottered them, and the commer
cial and" agricultural interests, from one end of thecountrv to the
other, are complaining of the scarcity of cars. This shows that the
railroads are doing a very heavy business, which would not be the
case were times quiet.
The export movement is also making a less favorable exhibit
of late, showing a falling off last week, while the imports were
larger. This condition may be changed later on, when we begin to
move the corn and cotton. Some cities report a falling off in the fall
demand, as the first rush to buy for the winter is over, but activity
in this direction is expected to be resumed later on. The manufac
turers are said to be so fully occupied that most of them cannot con
sider any orders for immediate delivery, while it is- also reported that
new business booked ahead into 1906 exceeds all previous exhibits.
The holiday demand, too, is opening so well that great activity in this
line is confidently expected. The iron and steel industry continues
to present an excellent aspect. Though the rail business has quiet
ed down somewhat, steel is reported scarce all over the country, and
the pressure for structural material continues. A number of the
large steel companies have placed â¢ important contracts, and the de
mand for foundry coke for delivery in 1906 has lately been so urgent
1 hat the coke is bringing a dollar a ton more than during the spring.
In this connection it is of interest to note that Russia is again in the
market as a buyer of American iron and steel.
The crops are now considered practically out of danger from
frost. Some frost was reported over parts of the cotton belt during
the week, and while the bulls tried to use it as a lever to advance
prices, it was the general opinion that there was no damage worth)'
of note, except in spots. Large crops of cotton and corn are still
considered assured -by the great majority of operators.
The financial features of the week were the continued compara
tively high rates for money and the speech of Ex-Assistant Secretary
of the Treasury Vanderlip at the bankers' convention at Washing
ton, which was construed as a warning from important financial in
terests against any bull movement in the stock market until the
monetary situation was improved. The speech caused immediate
selling, which carried prices down from one to three points, with the
largest losses in the higher priced stocks. â¢It was also {aken to indi
cate the attitude of the Standard City Bank party toward the mar
ket, and contained the ' significant statement that should a stock
market speculation start from the present level of prices in the face
of the extra demand upon money which the crop movement and
general business alike are now. making, ;v the, result might easily, be'
temporary disaster. Such a speech from such a man before such a
body as the bankers' convention at the nation's capital of course
had its effect, and doubt and uncertainty have been more or less vis
ible in the stock market ever since. Read between the lines it said :
"Prices for stocks are as high as they will stand at present, so pro
ceed with caution." It is the general conviction that while there will
be no startling rise in money, the market will continue more or less
high in comparison with the recent very low rates the rest of the
year.
Briefly stated, financial and mercantile conditions at present
seem to be controlled by a commendable conservatism on the part
of the controlling forces in finance, and that any tendency toward
undue expansion â to say nothing of inflation â will be promptly
suppressed by the great banking and financial powers. They arc
content to let well enough alone.
ECONOMY IN COOKING.
FIRELESS cook stoves were called attention to some months
ago by The Call, when a report came from the United States
consular clerk at Frankfort, Germany, in regard to them. The
discovery of such a surprising thing as a fireless cook stove was
deemed so important by our War Department that the commissary
general has had the subject investigated and the method of cooking
experimented with. The results were very satisfactory. The fire
less cook stove is more than a rumor and above the suspicion of
being a bit of modern mythology. It will effect both a great
economy and a great convenience in cooking. It will be invaluable
to troops in camp and on the march, and it would no doubt enable
such a saving in household expenditure for fuel, and lighten work
so much, that it would be advisable for all homes of moderate means
to test its merits.
The fireless stove cannot, of course, cook food without the aid
of any fire at all; its purpose is to be subsidiary to the ordinary
stove. It saves the expense and waste of time and attention in
keeping a fire going for a long time in order to prepare such
foods as require thorough boiling or roasting. Its other name is a
"hay box," and it consists of an air-tight receptacle lined with hay
or any non-conducting material, so as to prevent the cooling of the
boiling hot victuals placed therein. The heat, thus conserved, con
tinues the cooking process for hours after the food is put in the
box. So by transfer of the food from the hot stove to the tight box
a few minutes of brisk boiling does as good work, or better, than
keeping the fire going for a large fraction of an hour or more.
The scientific explanation of the fact is that after having once
made the food hot to the boiling degree you cannot without de
stroying it make it any hotter by any addition or long continuation
of the fire. If you keep this attained heat from escaping the cooking
process goes on unchecked. Any air-tight wooden box will do, and
any kind of lining will do that is a non-conductor. The box obviates
the danger of scorching, dispenses with the necessity of stirring and
enables the keeping of a dinner fresh and hot for an indefinite num
ber of hours without expense of fuel and waste of time in watching.
It is especially convenient in families whose members eat at dif
ferent hours. \u25a0 -/V'-Â£:/*7"
The "hay box" is not new as a mere keeper of food warm. It
was known of old to housekeepers as a convenience in that way;
but what is new is the .remarkable discovery that it will cook as well
as keep warm. A German lady at Frankfort found this out by acci
dent and desired to make the good thing widely known. She has
no stoves to sell and is giving away the; idea. Our commissary
general instructed Captain Murray at Fort Rile/, Kans., to test the
powers of such a stove. At that army post they have a school, for
bakers and are soon to establish a school for cooks. Captain Murray
found that with five or six minutes' preparatory boiling the box
would finish cooking rice, hominy, macaroni, Irish, stew, and even
accomplish the very difficult feat of boiling beans â which last if
often beyond the capacity of a long, hot fire % Captain Murray failed
in his first trials, but persevered till he learned how. He found
earthern pots and jars were best for this purpose, and he thinks
corrugated paper and powdered cork would be the best insulator.

Yearns for Crackers and Milk as
She Makes Record Mountain Climb
MISS EDITH LEE BAKER.
OVEB dizzy crevasses where woman
never climbed before, up slippery
inclines where a single misstep*
meant death, dangled by a rope
from precipitous heights, and hauled
back almost starved and beset by strange
delusionsâ these are a few of the perils
passed through by Miss Edith Lee Baker
of Chicago, who has conquered the Breit
horn. a 13.777 foot peak in the Alps, says
the Chicago Inter Ocean.
Miss Baker, who is the daughter of
Mr. and Mrs. Edward P. Baker, has ac
complished what many women have at
tempted to do and failed.
She ascended the Breithorn, a snow
covered mountain fifteen feet higher than
the world-famed Jungfrau, and made the
return, all in twenty-four hours of heart
breaking toil, fatigue and privation.
Many women have tried thejascent be
fore, but no woman, with the single ex
ception of Miss Baker, can boast that
she ended the adventure by a triumphant
return inside of twenty-four hours. In a
letter to friends in Chicago the plucky
young woman has described her feat. In
this she says:
"It was the prettiest little ascent im-
Acquisition of Self Confidence.
WALLACE RICE
HOW can one develop self-confidence
In business and society?" asks a
correspondent, who thus voices a
demand as universal as modest and
unassuming human kind, whe brought
into the conditions of modern city life.
Most of us lack self-confidence because
we believe ourselves to be at a disad
vantage when compared with others. We
come to have the feeling that we are dif
ferent in some mannerâ and that the dif
ference makes us the subject of adverse
comment.
This Is not in the least true in most
cases; but the first step toward self-cen
fldence is to remove all outward differ
ences likely to place one at a disadvan
tage.
To this end it seems to me that dress
is most important. The man not so well
dressed as another is always at a dis
advantageâand the more he realizes it
the more disadvantageous^ he is placed.
Clothes of stylish cut and excellent out
ward seeming never were cheaper tthatn t
they are to-day in every detail of either
the masculine or feminine wardrobe.
Carefully dressed and brushed, carefully
added to from time to time until some
thing in the nature of a wardrobe has
been acquired, they will remove every
external incentive to lack confidence In
one's self.
So much for the outside of the man,
his shell, as distinguished from himself.
The next point where he may appear at

on by my teeth. In one place I dangled
over a precipice when the guide pulled
me up with a rope.
"I felt the altitude and suffered by It.
When far up in the world of ice I began
to crave warm milk and crackers. It
was impossible, but I could not get the
thought out of my mind. It tortured me.
"On the descent the valleys in the
moonlight looked like big bowls filled
with milk, with crackers swimming in
them! When I reached the hotel the
first thing I thought of was milk and I
could not tell a thing of the beauties I
had seen."
The Alpine climb is not the first ad
venture in which Miss Baker has proved
her pluck. Two years ago she rescued
two women from drowning in the Medi
terranean Sea off the coast of Sicily.
Miss Baker Is just five feet tall and
slight. One of the women she rescued
weighed twice as much as the young
woman.
Before Miss Baker departed for Europe
seven years ago she swam twice across
Green Lake, Wis.. a distance of six miles.
She is a graduate of Kenwood Institute
and an expert tennis player.
Her father is a retired real estate man.
Reputable schools flourish in bur cities
and the social practice they insist upon
will at the same time destroy that diffi
dence which so often accompanies awk
wardness. .
Another point is to be interested in a
careful self-appraisal. Look yourself and
your accomplishments over, take account
of individual stock, and note where you
are strong, and where weak.
I once knew a most unassuming girl
who found herself compelled to face a
church full of eager people, who wished
to thank her for great kindness shown
them. She had never made a 'speech in
her life, and she went toward the plat
form with fear and trembling. Then she
remembered that they, were human like
herself, kindly disposedâ and she made an
excellent speech, and has been able to
speak well in public ever since.
Oratorical Big Wind.
Joe Blackburn was born with a vocal
batting average of 400. His wind velocity
has never been less than forty miles an
hour. Words flow from his mouth like red
tape from a magician's* hat. Across his
chest some miraculous agency has blown
into the flesh the cryptic words In large
display type, ''Vox et praeterea nihil."
A child of the storm, he was born to
defy the lightning, and to "call" the
whirlwind's wrath. Nobody before has
ever disputed the fact that he was the
oratorical Big Wind of Kentucky.â

ANOTHER STORY.
WITHIN the glade^ of the moon

. Their silver lay . along the; way
whereon we two were straying; \u25a0
O'er danced and slid her curls amid f they.
swung on swaying tresses
O'er eyes more blue than is the hue of
paths the sunlight presses.
So sweet was she, so fair to seeâ Heigho!
we've all been loversâ
A feast seemed spread on lips of red, and
I would move the covers;
And so â be still, my heart, nor thrill at
thought of olden gloryâ
I did what you perhaps would doâ but
that's another story.
If .gods had planned her little hand to
thrill its place of resting:
If they had meant each dimple's dent to
. be Love's bourn of nesting;
If all their skill to lure and thrill they'd
lavished on one maiden,
Till she had art to steal a heart with
adoration ladenâ
In faith they did; her graces hid a charm
for my undoing;
Her. lips of rtU forever said, "Who would
not here be wooing?"
Her vagrant hair was like a snare to
seize my heart, the tory;
Love's longing grew till close I drewâ
but that's another story.
Across the tide that stretches wide, the
tide of time and years,
I turn to-day where moonbeams play and
in my dream appears
The little g.ade where moonbeams
strayed and where the starlight shone,
And wander where I knew no care, and
wander rioc alone.
Again her hand by mine is spanned;
again her lips invite,
As if to say, "Please stray this way, al
though it is not right";
Again I hold, as in the oldâ ay, sing
love's song, and swell it!
But that's another story, andâ l \u25a0 prom

A BRIEF EXTRACT.
(From the glittering tale which is ex
tremely popular with twelve-year-old em
bryotic citizens.)
"His-s-st!"
The word was spoken by Terrible Tom,
the Sinister Sleuth of the Unwashed Ten
ements.
It died away in a long eerie wail, as
the Sinister Sleuth silently stood as if
awaiting his laundry bill.
"They are coming!" he murmured, in
voluntarily grasping closer the revolver
in his right hand and the gatling gun in
his left. '
There was a hush.
It grew louder.
Suddenly a somber procession stole si
lently into view from around the corner
of Wiggses' saloon.
The procession grew.
It grew some more.
They were the* Avengers of the Night.
Although the Night had n u . asked for
any Avengers.
There were twenty-nine of them.
They were on the train of Terrible Tom,
the Sinister Sleuth.
Terrible Tom raised his trusty revol
ver.
A loud report was heard.
He had tired. (/
The twenty-nine Terrible Avengers
were dead.
- Each one of them was dead.
"So were all of them.
The bullets had passed through twenty
nine hearts.
' It v hadn't missed a heart.
Each one of the bodies lay with its
head between the feet of the body be
hind it. .
Terrible Tom wept.
"Alas!" he moaned, "I have missed my
aim."
The left foot of one of the bodies was
three inches too far from the left ear
of the body In front of him.
The line was out of true! .

CONCERNING POLITICS.
The last resort of a politician who is a
knave is to pose as savior of men. He
hires a hall, ,or several halls, calls
attention to the wounds he has
received in the course of excor
iation for his rascality, and loudly pro
claims that they are the wounds pro
duced by his crown of thorns. And the
worst feature in the case is that he gen
erally prevails t>n many honest men, who
would like to see good government, to
believe in him. No false prophet is
without his rule believers; there is plenty
of genuine belief in a Dowie.
Petit juries have been misled when they
convicted my sub-rascals, says our king
rascal; grand juries have erred when
they told the truth concerning me; prose
cuting, officers have served the purposes,
of the gentiles: I admit that some of my
officials are Incarcerated, but they should
not have beenâ this is the crown of thorns
that I ha ve worn, and all in my desire
to help you.
Andâ make no mistake about itâ this
flubdub too frequently is believed, and,
"This is our Savior!" the deceived ones
cry. Undeceive the men who want decent
government, let no rascal mislead them;
and the battle wjll be won; but as to how
this cood end is to be attainedâ that is
another and a more serious matter.

A Study of Obstinacy.
DOROTHY FENIMORE
rpHAT obstinacy is a sign of weak-
I ness of will, instead of volitional
* strength, as popularly supposed,
is the conclusion which Theodate
L. Smith, the psychologist, has reached,
after researches into the causes and
effects of human balkiness. That It Is
a common trait of the feeble-minded and
degenerate shows this; so also does the
fact that It is characterized by a loss
of muscular control.
The frequency with which young
children whose wills are weak are
seized by such attacks, and the relief
they seem to feel when helped back to
a normal state of mind and body by
tenderness and sympathy offers further
evidence in support of our hypothesis.
A final proof is lound in the testi
mony of adults who recall that in their
childish fits of willfulness often they
wished to yi^ld, but could not.
To mothers who have boys and girls
that become stiff and mute In response
to a "must" or "must not." or that
grow limber, like Tommy in "Lovey
Mary," whenever their wills are
crossed. Miss Smith sounds both a note
of hope and a note of warning.
Obstinacy in early childhood Is a
normal symptom. Poor health and
fatigue are ordinary exciting causes;
yet r perfectly healthy child may suffer
as much as a sick one, and be more
difficult to manage. For he is naturally
egoistic, and when his will, which is as
emotional and Impulsive as his instinc
tive desires are strong, comes into con
flict with autnority. it is stunned by
the very force of its own Impetus.
Yet this tendency must be overcome,
since it is through self-control alone
that strength will be developed. Train
ing in obedience is training of the will.
Who almost reach the goal desired.
And never quite succeed?^ :
The man who fails, and wholly falls.
We lose him in the din.
But here's a sigh, or haply two.
For those who almost win.
They see the trophy they would win
Almost within their grasp.
But when they strive to seize It then.
The prize they fail to grasp.
I think the most unhappy wights
Who hold misfortune kin
Are not the ones who ne'er had hope,
. But those who almost win.
To almost grasp the thing desired,
GAVE HIM ATVAJ.
Mrs. Askittâ I heard you had a
surprise party at your house yes
terday. Â«,
Mrs. Tellltt (absently)â Yes âmy
husband gave me $10 without my
asking for It.
The stronger your child's sense of per
sonality Is the harder your task will
be. but the more lasting will be the
effects of a victory.
At the moment of the obstinacy It
may be desirable to leave ' the child
alone, In order that his physical and
mental strain may both diminish. But
you must keeD to your word and exact
obedience.
To appreciate the good sense of Miss
Smith's point of view one has only to
observe how many obstinate people
there are among the world's failures.
To have your own way every time,
just because it Is your way, means get
ting Into the mo3t hopeless kind of
rut. You come to see only one side
of the question â your side. You be
come a slave of habit of the, thins: that
you like to do. or are used to doing.
Worse yet. you are as unreasonable
and as narrow-sighted as a balky old
horse in blinders.
There is before us at this moment
an instructive example of national ob
stinacy. The sardine fishermen of
Brittany â that country of stupidly^j
stinate men â are facing starva'lflj-j,
simply because they will not give xtp
an old and impracticable method for
a new one which would serve them
better under existing 1 conditions.
A trust has been formed to control
the Norwegian market of the cod roe
which has been used in Brittany as
bait to attract the fish to the nets, and
the price has been put up so high that
the fishermen can no longer afford to
buy it. But so great Is their obstinacy
in preserving an ancestral custom that
they -would rather starve than use thÂ»
device which the government advo
cates, after scientific experiment, of
luring the fish to the nets by means of
acetylene lamps immersed In the water.
Then lose it with a sigh;
To view the rainbow wings of hope*
And then to see it die â
Ah, you may shed what tears you will
For those who ne'er begin. .
But here's a sigh, or haply two.
For those who almost win.

A HILL TALE
A Blunt Old Colorado Mlnrr on Poatum.
A clergyman may he eloquent, may
use the choicest language, dressing 1 his
earnest desire to help his fellow man
In the most elevated, chaste and beauti-
ful language, and yet not touch the
hearts of his hearers. Another man,
having little education and no grace
of speech whatsoever, may tell his ncÂ«-
tsage in the common, everyday vernacu-
lar he Is used to, and the simple faith
that glows with him carries quick con-
viction with It. Such a man writes
from the towering peaks of Colorado,
preaching of Postum:
"I had drunk coffee all niy life until
It about killed" me, when I concluded
to try Postum, and In a short time I
pot relief from the terrible misery 'I
euffered from coffee.
"When I drank coffee I bloated up bo
that I could not breathe at times; my
nerves were so shaky that I could not
hold -myself still.
"But thanks to Postum I am all well ;
row and can say that I hope to re- j
main so. J
â¢'I-was very much disgusted with it;
the first time I tried it, but had it made '
stronger and boiled longer till it tasted
as good as good coffee."
No amount of rhetorical frills and
literary riollsh could add to the con-
vincing power of the old miner's tes-
timony. Name given by the Postum

LANDMARKS NIGHT PROMISES
TO BE BRILLIANT SUCCESS.
Daughters of Pioneers -Will Be Hostesses
SUFFRAGISTS TO MEET IN CONVENTION
LAURA BRIDE POWERS
"Landmarks Night" of the Pioneers'
Daughtersâ October 24â is getting on fa
mously. '. â¢
; Never was such enthusiasm shown .in
behalf of California's historic landmarks
as now. The people have at last awak
ened to their r civic obligation, and though
the response has come upon the eve of
dissolution.'it comes not too late, and the
honor of the State is in a 1a 1 fair 'way -to' be
savedâ thanks to"* the splendid service of
the Daughters of California Pioneers. !
All Oalifornians know the dissoluble
quality of adobe. All Californians know
that an unprotected adobe structure melts
away before the rains of winter, and
this is the proposition that now confronts
the Landmarks League in its endeavor to
save -the Mission San Antonio de Padua
in Monterey County.
As has been told before,* the league has
restored the two great walls of the beau
tiful old chapelâ the most picturesque old
mission north of Santa Barbaraâ but
scarcity of funds has prevented the lay
ing 'â¢ of the roof over them.- Thus they
have stood for over a year, imperfectly
protected with makeshifts of lumber and
tar paper, while the lumber for the roof
has lain pitifully useless in the patioâ all
bt- cause the people of- California didn't
care â or perhaps they didn't know.
But the people of San Francisco know
nowâ and they are proving that they
care.
They have grasped the fact that the
precious old heirloom of the nation must
be saved now or never, and they have se r ,
to work to save it, under the leadership
of the Daughters of the California Pio
neers.
And it seems eminently fit that these
daughters of pioneer sires should helD in
the patriotic work, even, as did; the Na
tive Sons and the Native Daughters at
previous .times of stress.
And this is how the Daughters propose
to help: They will give a "Landmarks
Night" at thÂ£ Pioneer Hall on the 28th
that will set a new stancard for future
entertainment, for behold a partial re
cital of what will be offeredâ and for 50
cents, j?ood friend.
Lecture, â¢ with 125 rare illustrations,
upon "Historic Landmarks of California,"
by Congressman Joseph R. Knowland.
Solo by Miss Kathrin Hilke, the famous
soprano soloist of Damrosch's Choral
Union, and of St. Patrick's choir of New
York, now visiting here.
Knickerbocker Quartet.
Music by the Presidio band.
Dancing after the lecture.
Card tournament, whist or 500, in re- ,
ception room (concurrent with the lec
ture), with accommodation and prizes for
500 guests.
Allurements of a Dunch bowl.
Seduction of a Turkish room, where
cigars and cigarettes of a. humane quality
may be enjoyed.
Now, aside from patriotic impulses,
doesn't that programme offer you your
moneys worth?
Then the half-dollar you pay at the
doorâ no. more, lest you be thirsty or
need a smokeâ will help to save to Cali
fornia one of her most valuable assets
and dearest possessions.
You will come?
There will be an abundance of pretty
maids -to- serve youâand some charming
women to look after you.
The affair. Is under the general super
vision of Mrs. Sidney Smith Palmer, pres
ident of the Daughters, and the Immedi
ate direction of Mrs. E. J. Foster, chair
man. \u25a0
* * '
Apropos of the people's awakening, it
is a joy to relate that the Papyrus Club
(Mrs. A. S. Leake, president) has sent a
check to the president of the Pioneer
Daughters to help the cause along. And
it is interesting to note that such action
has come unsolicited from a club that is
essentially not a working club.
Two important affairs are on the cards
this weekâ the reception to Governor and
Mrs. Pardee by the California Club on
Tuesday afternoon, and the annual con
vention of the California Equal Suffrage
Association on Friday and Saturday at
Wheeler's Auditorium, 1215 Sutter street.
The California Club will have the honor
of listening to the Governor in a little
heart-to-heart talk.presumably upon some
educational topic, sine/? the day is under
the direction ' of the department of edu
cation, Mrs. John Buss chairman. The
afternoon will afford many interesting
people an opportunity to look over the
stunning new clubhouse â the . first
woman's clubhouse in California.
* * *
As to 'the -State Suffrage Association's
convention of Friday and Saturday, 'It
promises much of interest, as leaders in
the cause of "equal justice to all" will
foregather from every burg in the State
âand the burg Is pretty small now. that
hasn't a suffrage club in it.
The following is the announcement sent
broadcast through the State: /.
"Although the last Legislature of Cal
ifornia' refused to submit. an amendment
of the constitution to the voters grant
ing full suffrage to the women of the
State, we, the womSn of California/know
no defeat, and are resolved to carry; on
with increased vigor the agitation for po
litical equality. "We demand equal priv
ileges for all citizens without regard to
sex. ' â¢: "-'\u25a0.. ;\'.'
â¢'Henry Blackwell, that earnest worker
for all that is uplifting to humanity,' says,
'We shall never have good government
until it ' is made by men and ' womenâ a
constituency too ..numerous to be bribed,
and too independent to be coerced.'
"A cordial invitation Is extended to all
men and women 'who believe In the
American principle of 'equal Justice to all'
to meet with us in convention to review,
the work of the past and plan for the
future. ; "

The \u25a0 Outdoor League enjoyed a cozy
little luncheon on Saturday in the Cali
ifornia Club house. The menu was simple
but the toasts were rich and satisfying,
for the subject was "Man." Each mem
ber had something to say about him. The
great manâ the vain manâ the fat manâ
the good manâ in fact, Man in many, of
his phases was presented, and yet the
subject was not exhausted and will be
resumed at another luncheon to occur
next month.

Unique Entertainment Is
Planned by Mont ana Mem
bers of the Order.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BOZBMAN, Mont., Oct. 15.â The 250
members of the Modern Woodmen of
American in this city are making prep
arations for their annual hunt, which
will occur October 29, 30, 31 and No
vember 1. The event promises to be
extremely unique. Two captains have
been elected to lead the hunters â
George. Whitney and J. M. Prattâ both
of whom enjoy the reputation of being
crack shots. Two lists of the Wood
men who desire to hunt will be made
and from these the captains will take
turns in choosing those whom they de
sire on their respective sides, In much
the same manner as the old spelling
matches were conducted. It is thought
there wlll # be about one hundred nlm
rods on each side, who will hunt for
a part of the time or for the whole four
days as they, are able.
Game will be counted according to
the effort required in this locality to
procure, as follows Elk, 6000 points;
bear, 5000; mountain goat, 5000; deer,
3000; grouse, 500; ducks, 100; chickens,
.100; pheasants, 10; rabbits, 20; trout,
50, and whlteflsh, 40.' All game must
be delivered to the appointed judges
before 10 o'clock on the morning of
November 2 at the place designated and
any received after that hour will not
be c counted. The side securing the
greater number of points will be de
clared the winner and the losing side
will be obliged to treat at a game sup
per the night of November 2 The
game for the supper must be furnished
by the losers. The Royal Neighbors
will assist in preparing the tempting
viands for the banquet at which . 300
covers' will be laid. The contest is
already arousing much interest and
many. ' wagers have been made.
PRINCE OF WALES
HAS YANKEE JOCKEY
Engages J. H. Martin at
High Salary for the
Season.
LONDON, Oct. 15â When the Prince of
Wales commences to put his horses on
the race track next year an American
Jockey will be retained. According to the
latest report from well authenticated
sources in Newmarket, where the Prince's
stables are situated, the choice has fallen
on J. H. Martin. The Prince will have
first call on him, and for this right he
will nay $10,000 a year, exclusive of the
ordinary riding fees regulated by the
jockey club.
The Prince, like his father, would like
to secure Maher, but Maher's present
employer. Sir James Miller, Is too wealthy
a man to allow any one to outbid him for
the services of his favorite Jockey.
As usual, there is considerable jealousy
exhibited among English jockeys who ex
pected to be Invited to be the favorite of
the* Prince of Wales. Martin has hitherto
been practically a free lance, but: those
who understand jockeyshlp know that he
has no superior on the English race
track.
As he will be eligible to ride for ather
owners when not called upon by the
Prince's stables. Martin's income for 1 1906
ought to reach $20,000.

MURDERS WIFE

Suicide of Aged Man Follows
the Fatal Shooting of His
Young Daught er-in-Law
TRAGEDY- IN A HACK
Letter in Woman's Purse In
dicates That Husband Was
Wronged by His Father
SIOUX CITY, la., Oct. 15.â While
driving in a hack from a hotel to a
railway station here to-day, E. H.
Uarrow, aged 60, shot and killed his
son's wife, Lilian. Darrow, aged 25, and
then shot and killed himself.
The hack driver," immediately upon
hearing the first shot and without stop
ping to investigate, started for the po
lice station. When the police station
was reached both occupants of the
carriage, sitting upright on opposite
seats, were found to be dead.
â¢ The cause of the tragedy is not
known. E. H. Darrow and the woman
came to the Arcade Hotel in this city
on October 10,. registering as "E. H.
Darrow and wife." This afternoon
they started for the railway station,
ostensibly to take a train for Sioux
Falls, the home of Mr. Darrow's son.
The murdered woman formerly was
Miss Lilian Morrison, a school teacher.
Five years ago she was married to
W. E. Darrow and they removed to
Bellefourche, S. D.
Letters were found In the woman's
purse, unsigned but apparently from
her husband, saying the writer was
dying of a broken heart.

CRISIS OFJIRLHOOD
A TIME OF PAIN AMD PERIL
Miss Emma Cole Says that Lydia B
Pinkham's Vegetable Compound has
Saved Her Life and Made Her Well
How many lives of beautiful young
girls have been sacrificed just as they
were ripening into womanhood I How
many irregularities or displacements
have been developed at this important
period, resulting in years of suffering !
g Jtdisj 'em ma cJo/p /\
Girls' modesty and oversensitiveness
often puzzle their mothers and baffle
physicians, because they withhold their
confidence at this critical period.
A mother should come to her child's
aid and remember that Lydia E. Pink-
ham's Vegetable Compound' will at this
time prepare the system for the coming
change and start the menstrual period
in a yoimg girl's life without pain or
irregularities.
Miss EmmaColeof Tullahoma, Term.,
writes:
Dear Mrs. Finkham; â
" I want to tell you that I am enjoying bet-
ter health than I have for years, aid I owe
it all to Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Com-
pound.
'â¢ When fourteen years of age I suffered al-
most constant pain, and for two or. three
years I had soreness and pain in my side,
headaches and was dizzy and nervous, ana
doctors all failed to help me.
" Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound
was recommended, and after taking it my
health began to improve rapidly, and I think
it saved my life. I sincerely hope my experi-
ence will be a help to other girls who are pass-
ing from girlhood to womanhood, for I know
your Compound will do as much for them."
If . you know of any young girl who is
pick and needs motherly advice ask her
to write Mrs. Pinkham, Lynn, Mass.,
and she will receive free advice which
will put her on the right road to a strong,
healthy and happy womanhood. .

74 days ago and still STAYS cured. Lest

WHISPER at 20 feet after I had touched it
ONE MOMENT with a handkerchief which
Rexradlo had CHARGED with his h'd
RADIUM power, though he never personally
' came into contact with the patient, who
Etood 20 feet froni him. PROMINENT PRO-
FESSIONAL man badly PARALYZED, could
not RISE from a chair without two persons
LIFTING him up. also could not raise foot
from floor. Instantly ROSE from chair UN-
AIDED and LIFTED foot from floor. DEAF

Wlmt London Eats.
The supply of meat in the Smlthfleld
market during 1904 amounted to the little
matter of 410,519 tons, of which the siim
of 1556 tons was condemned.. In fact. Dr.
Collingridge, the* medical officer, made"
himself unusually bus*y during -the past
year. Out of a single consignment of
rabbits from Australia he threw out 10,332
as a little spoiled.
As for fish, 243,806 tons of them were
delivered at Billingsgate. Of this amount
1098 tons were condemned. In the matter
of milk Dr. Collingridge reportsvthat one
In every thirteen samples was either im
poverished or adulterated, or both. He
blames the foreign-born trader for this
state of affairs. From 10,000 to 15,000
oysters are sold dally in London , during
the season. Last year no Illness attrib
uted to them was reported.â London Mail.

fleet Young Pepper in the deciding

LONELY LIFE FINALLY
WINS TRADER FORTUNE
Eight Yearn Spent on the Lower
Yukon Well Repays the
Patient Man. \u25a0'
With Alaska furs valued at $25,000
from Nuluto, on the Lower Yukon, Gar
rett Bush has arrived in Seattle after
eight years spent in trafficking with
the Indians in the wilderness which he
was the first white man to penetrate
as a trader. When Mr. Bush reached
Nulato August 1-, 1897, with a miner's
outfit as his sole possession, he foresaw
in that gloomy solitude a trade in the
furs which protect animal life from
arctic winters which would exceed in
returns the reasonable possibilities of
mining ventures. .
Mrr Bush settled down at the place
where the little town of Nulato now
stands. He built a one-story cabin
with lumber which he sawed from the
native timber and began to trade his
miners' supplies to the natives for the
furs which they knew so well how to
trap, but of whose value they had no
conception. Through the first winter
he lived alone, except when an oc
casional squad of Indian trappers came
by and stopped in curiosity to learn
what manner of man had settled in so
lonely a spot. To these Indians he
traded his humble supplies except the
provisions which he actually needed to
sustain his own existence until spring.
The visits of the i.idians wre few and
far . between. The solitary trader was
often.homesicK as he. sat through tne al
most perpetual darkness of the/Arctic
winter. In the short hours of gllmmer
ii.g daylight he gathered his little stores
of firewood, dragging them through the
snow, and then sat through the long
nicht counting off the days on the calen
dar until spring. His nearest white
neighbors were at Anvik. 200 miles down
the Yukon, and at Weare, 240 miles up
the stream. He never saw a white face
until nearly a year after his arrival at
Nulato. .
When spring. broke upon the lonely.her
mit life assumed a more cheerful aspect.
The fame of the new white trader had
spread "far through the- Indian settle
ments and the natives began calling regu
larly at the post with their stock of furs.
I They came from Koyokuk, from, Innoko
and from Kuskokwin, some of them
traveling nearly 500 miles.
The prospects of the fur trade became
so bright that .Mr. Busch sent to .New
York for his wife to come out and join
him. ; .
She did so, taking with her their two
babies, a boy. and a girl. These children
have learned to sp*eak the Indian ; lan
guage fluently, but last fall were sent
back to New York to be educated.âSeat

Business Inxtluet on a Farm.
A few years ago a comparatively young
man was working as a 'clerk in a country
bank in 'the Southwest. He did not see
much future in the banking business,
but he did I see vast acres of land, be
longing to the Indian tribes, lying un
tilled. There seemed to be a future in
the land and it appeared to him easier
to acquire land than a bank. So he be
gan to cultivate Indian chiefs, not in a
hit or miss fashion, but with as much
system as an advertising man follows
up a prospective customer, only it was
a different kind of follow-up system.
And it required the same characteristics
the salesman requires, says the narrator
in System. He had his goal distinctly
in mind; .he knew the Indiansâ how to
approach them. He secured the Indians'
consent to lease him 50.000 acres at 45
cents an acre. Then he secured the con
sent of the Indian agent, which was
probably another ticklish task. That was
six or eight years ago. The greater part
of the money he began with was bor
rowed. Last year the earnings from this
ranch were over ;i50.000; SOOO cattle. 500,000
bushels of grain; that Is the way. the
results run.
For the sVime system that was used In
acquiring the ranch 13 being used In its
operation. This man, George W. Miller,
is not a farmer: he is a business manâ a
business man of the modern type, who
works through organization.â New .York

OAKLAND. Oct. 15â The exodus of
Â«!uck awl <juall hunters from this city late
yesterday and early this morning for the
hunting grounds was far greater than in
any previous season at opening day. To
night many of the crack shots wended
their weary way homeward, and with
srareely an exception the sportsmen had
bap-ped "the limit" of birds. Colonel R.
F. MrKilican, Walter Haskell end \V

port the -sport a* first class.

Farmer Sheriff Oscar Rogers, with dog

shooting apparently at random that he
abandoned the sport, fearing to be mis
taken for a bird and peppered with fine
bird shot.

A MOTOR CYCLE RECORD
Saa Joxe Boy Reein Off a Mile In the
I'aM Time of 1t32.
SAN JOSE. Oct. 15. â The best motor
cycle race ever witnessed In this city
took place this afternoon, when records
went a-giimmering notwithstanding a
terrible neadwind. Johnny Baumgart
ner. the local motorist, was the shining
star of the meet, winning with eas-3
both the three and five mile events.
The three-mile race was won In 3:51 1-5
and the five miles In 6:17 3-5. Hal Mc-
Cormick, who was scheduled to ride
the exhibition one-mile for the Pacific
Coast paced cycle record, cut down the
figure by 2 2-5 seconds, making the
mile In 1:32. Carl Showalter tried fpr
the five-mile paced coast record, ' but
failed. With three laps to go lie lost
his motor cycle pacing, but at that time
was well inside the record made by L.
Downing. The first mile he rode In
1:41, the two miles in 3:21, three miles
in 4:51 and four mile in 6:26.
During the final of the three-mile
motor cycle race. William Lang had an
escape from death. While going at a
mile a minute clip following the lead
of Baumgartner he was thrown from
his machine with terrific force, but
g'wing to the fact that be skidded
".long and onto the earth his injuries
were not serious. The accident â¢, oc
curred on the tenth lap.

The Sea'.s sure did have the class on
Russ Hall's Siwashes yesterday. Twice
they made the northern stars out second
raters. The first victory was one of
those that go down on the pages of base
ball history as a lucky win. but the sec
ond was legitimate, for the Seals had
the wallop and they never overlooked a
chance to take a ride on the offerings of
Hall or Jones.
It was a Sunday baseball game for the
rabble. The holiday crowd always wants
to see the home'team make as many runs
as possible except when Oakland plays.
Yesterday every fan on the lot was for
the Seals and the cheers and boosts of
the multitude seemed to count some, for
San Francisco was the only team that
figured from the first Innmg on.
Captain Russ Hall made a boot when
Waldron shot the first one at him in the
j opening inning. Kid Mohler tried to sac
rifice, but forced his man at second. The
Kid lost no time In stealing and when
Hall tossed to the base, trying to catch
him napping, he started for third. The
peg was very wild and the Kid had lots
of time to make the trip to the plate.
That first run was only a tester, for
the Peals began to open up on Hall in
the third In a manner that was shameful
and ungentlemanly. Every one on the
team seemed to have a base hit in his bat
and they ail began to unload them so
fast that two runs came through quickly.
The avalanche of runs did not cease in
the fourth, for the Seals copped iwo more
and they topped victory off during the
fifth by annexing another and making
the grand total six tor the game.
Jimmy Whalen was pitching ball that
should entitle any twirler to a shutout.
But the two errors of Johnny Goch
nauer in the fifth inning were costly \
ones. He allowed Kaphan to get a life on
a fumble and the next two men ad
vanced the runner along the line. When
the stde looked about In Gochnauer
booted one more and a run came over,
though Seattle was not entitled to it.
Joe Nealon came to the bat three times
and he walloped the leather. In the fifth
he opened up with a triple against the
deep left field fence and Householder sent
him through with one to left. The game
was full of fielding sensations and Moh
ler and i_Â»cnnett managed to divide the
honors between them. The score:

FIRE DAMAGES UIG AUTO
THAT WON VANDERBILT CUP
Gaftollne Isrnltcn While Machine) Is
Being I'rcpared for Shipment
to France. ' ;
NEW YORK, Oct. 15. â The French'
automobile "driven to victory In Satur
day's Vanderbllt cup race on. Long
Island by. Hamery. was badly damaged
to-day by fire and one, workman was
burned about the head as he attempted
to save the car. It is believed the acci
dent was due to the carelessness of a
spectator while the machine was being
prepared for shipment to France at
the French headquarters at Mineola,
Long Island. : . .
Drivers and j workmen on the racing
cars had warned people â¢to keep away
from them with matches or cigars, but
it is thought â¢ that while the gasoline
was being drawn from the winning ma
chine to-day somebody approached with
a â¢ lighted match. ". At any rate \ the
flames suddenly flashed from the gaso
line can, spread to the automobile and
before they were extinguished dam
aged it so that extensive repairs will
bl necessary. The workman who was
caught in attempting to remove
can was not severely burned. Hun
dreds of people called at the French
headquarters to-day to
the winner of yesterday's race.

NEW YORK, Oct. 15. â Six events
confront jj the racegoers to-morrow,
when the! Metropolitan Jockey Club's
i.iteÂ«n days' autumn meeting will be
gin 'at the Jamaica race course. The
I'ierpont handicap at nine furlongs is
a feature for so late in the year, and
while no doubt there will be some
scratches, there will be enough left
in to guarantee a tirst-class contest.
Tfta added money â $2500 â is extreme
ly liberal for this time of the season,
and while the real stars of the racing
establishments are now in retirement,
there remain a very fair number of
horses a shade less pretentious who are
qualified to make it interesting for
each other and incidentally for the pub
lic. Santa Catalina is generally con
sidered the best horse In this race and
the track suits her.
The handicaps run at the recent Bel
mont Park meeting were more than
usually interesting, and the two long
distance races were also full of an
ticlpatious interest to the thinking ob
servers. The same class of racers will
be- seen at Jamaica and Aqueduct and
a fair proportion will go to Baltimore
and Washington, i.o that, while the
close of Belmont Park season marked
the end of racing '(the very highest
class, it by no means follows that the
remaining seven weeks of the Eastern
season will be barren; in fact, they are
usually invested with a reasonable
amount of Interest, even to the non
b .ling public.

Some exciting tennis was played on the
Golden Gate Park tennis courts yester
day, when play was resumed in the tour
naments for the championship of the
bay counties. At the conclusion of the
day's play two contestants remained in
the singles and four teams in the dou
bles. Percy MurdocJc, the Alameda Coun
ty crack, and Charles Foley of the Goldten
Gate Club won their semi-final matches,
and will come together in the finals next
Sunday.
In the doubles Foley and R. N. Whit
ney won two matches easily, and will play
in the finals. In the lower half but one
match was played.' In it the Baker
brothers defeated Harry Rolfe and Her

ond round. Gayness and Hall won a place
In the semi-finals last Sunday and will
be pitted against the winner of the match
between Gardner and Dunlap and the
Baker brothers.
No surprises were "sprung yesterday,
the matches resulting as expected. The
feature was the match between Percy
Murdock and Clarence Griffin. It was
undoubtedly the best match of the meet.,
and kept the spectators guessing right to
the finish. Griffin was expected to make a
good showing against his older and more
experienced opponent, but he surprised
even his most ardent admirers. The
match' went the full five sets and Mur
dock won by a very narrow margin.
It was a clever exhibition from start
to finish. Young Griflln put up a game
fight ana, although beaten, was by no

Murdock led at 4-2. but Griffin ran out

"Again*! the grafters." hung from

and as Mr. Partridge* has said, "ihe

A prominent painter of this city, era
ploying union men and paying union
wages, placed thirty. Partri4ge. banners
in the section of the city, bounded by
Ea?i, Ninth. Howard and" Brannan
Streets, under contract w}th the league.
Later- Jn .the afternoon * Brown/ the
painter, visited the places and not a

In one place the union painters
working -on the signs were insulted
end aisaulted' with mud and stones by
the hoodlums gathered about ,the
workmen. The abusÂ« became so vio
lent that Brown addressed the crowd,
asking for. fair treatment of union
tnen receiving' union wages, 'â¢ and . was
met with foul and ab-js s ve' language.
UnÂ« man In the Thirty-third District
rat compelled to ask the campaign
committee to remove the banner, as he
feared violence. Volleys'of stories had
broken hie windows and mud plastered
tl."Â» entire building. In another dis
trict the committee removed a frame
work after the banner had been cut
away, although the owner begged the
committee to send another banner and
station a man 'to catch the miscreants.
Thf same spirit of disorder is mani

Not. alone in tfie districts south of

dowji a fusion banner, that bears the
words, "Against . the grafters." The

I Animal Enraged Because
Boniilliis Does Xot Make
Xoise Like a Milk Can
A small family cow from Arixona
; made Morris Levy's bullfisrhter, Ro-
m ulus. throw- up the sponge in two
i rounds yesterday.
â¢ Morris Levy. was the only one around
I the grounds who was able to "throw
â¢ the bull." Morris can throw the "bull"
! any time, but the multitude wanted to
\u25a0 sec Koniuius rough th<: cow. They
j were tired of Levy's "bull."
| Three picadors junipeu into "the ring
â¢ Hrst. Ttitt Arizona cow looked ready
jt> be milked. It. was the meekest
j little "bossy" that ever loomed up as
j easy for a bold toreador with a repu
! tatlon inflated by the Levy hot air.
Uui wow. what a surprise for the
| toreador. The little cow charged right
and left and the bullfighters had im
; i-oriani engagements outside the fence.
j Komulus looked at the now. He didn't
I like her looks at all. She felt Insulted.
! She thought sne had been brought
there to do her evening stunt with the
j milkmaid. Instead of that she was as
: sailed by three rude men. Mercyl
Romulus looked as if he wished that
[ he were back in South San Francisco or
] Mexico, or any' place wnere Morris Levy
! could not follow him.
The cow eyed the toreador suspici
ously. If he had made a sound like a
milk can the cow would have been
more ladylike. But Romulus reached
over and threw his arms around the
animal's neck. The cow naturally ob
jected to this familiarity on such
short acquaintance and threw Romulus
into the dirt.
The toreador lay on his back for a
while wondering why the females of
every species wfere so capricious. The
cow slapped him upon. the wrist with
her hoof. Romulus went over the
fence Uke a skyrocket.
"El toro has conquered me," he an
nounced. "1 throw up el sponge to la
cow. Brava !a cow!"
"Three cheers for tiie cow!" yelled
the crowd. "Now let fcer be milked in
peace." .â¢ . .
"You are a four-flusher," shouted Ab
raham Frledlander, oneof Morris Levy's
retainers. You never threw a bull in yÂ«ur
life."
"Caramba," replied the toreador.
"Let Morris Levy throw^ the bull. He
is a great thrower of 'the bulL Si,
Morrid Levy Is le grande toreador."
With language that scorched Levy
and his man Friday the faithful
Friedlander drove poor Romulous Into
making another attempt to upset hi 3
rival. The cow by this time suspected
that Romulus had evil designs upon
her. - She did not .wait "for . the r rattle
of the milk cans.- She was a very in
dignant lady. She poked the toreador
in the region of nis breakfast and hy
quit. ' \u25a0;-
There was some alleged bronco
busting that might furnish food for
thought to the Cruelty to Animals So
ciety. All of the bronks were so
worn out in the roping that they had
only a few staggers left when the
vaqueros mounted them. A wrestling
bout between two unknown tramps
was ;ilso added to the agony.
Even the old greased pig. game was
strung on to help, wear away the aft
ernoon for a disgusted crowd. After
charging through the bullpen the pork
was roped in by one of Morris Levy's
coon retainers. "Even the pig race was
flxed/'-remarked the Butchertown con
tingent. â¢ :V,' '"..-: , >

HOW SAN FRANCISCO LOOKS
WITH THE "LID" OFF.
CITY'S GONIDITION IS VILE
Captain of Police
Says Graft Is ;
Rampant
Tells How Tricky
LJUooto VJCllll
The auditorium, of the .Young Men's
Christian Association was packed yes
terday afternoon by members and their
friends, who gathered to hear theY re
marks of Captain \V. J.Petersen of, the
Oakland police- department. Captain
Petersen- through long connection with
.the police department- was able to show
his hearers many of the inner workings
of corrupt- politics and the conditions
of a city in which the lid. is off. as in
San Francisco to-day. '
In the course of his speech Captain
Petersen. said:
. This great city with Its many advantages,
its 'commanding geographical situation and its
intelligent people is bound to Influence the Oc
cident and the Orient; it lias within its power
the opportunities 91 great good or appalling
evil. Upon the men of San Francisco will rest
the responsibility for thÂ« ruture Influence -of
this great city.
The other day a man died In your city. He
had reaped the whirlwind; the red light dis
trict knew him as a prood fellow. He had trod
den the primrose path that means wine, women,
debauchery and disgrace. When- he had dissi
pated all his- energy, 1 sapped his strength,
wasted his money, he wao.nu more made wel
come in the haunts where money Is the, only
agency that opens the way to their pleasures.
When he bad filled -'his last glass with th<;
drug that ended his existence on earth, among
the last words he wrote for those who would
flnd his body was "San . Francisco is the cor
nerstone or hell." To-day the' big cities are
ruling: the nation, and Its does seem that the
greater the population the viler and moni
vicious the . cities become ' \u25a0'\u25a0\u25a0 The congestion,
poverty, crime 'and corruption In politics are
problems for conslCeration needing brave, patri
otic. God-fearing men to solve.- -
Police departments are In . close touch with
all the elements that debase and degrade hu
manity, and when, properly governed can do
much to pre\ent crime and elevate morals.
My long experience has taught. me how Inef
fectual is the work of a corrupt politician If
he cannot control the police. With the police
with him he can Intimidate votprs, permit the
work of the grafter and the political rounder,
control the backrooms of saloons and give the
reward of immunity from punishment to those
who- have trained with his political machine for
violation of the law. He can give special priv
ileges to gamblers, pool sellers,? keepers of
houses of 111 fame, thieves- and blacklegs and
can- cause, the blue-coated- guardians of the
peaco to be deaf and dumb \u25a0 and blind as oc
casion â¢ makes it necessary for ..him to pay his
political debts or. to Increase his political pree-
B ' JciTVS WEIGHT OF SIX.
We .read 'of thn fin nna crime of .this city
with passing emotion, bur sometimes ,we are
aroused from . the calm . that our own -security
gives at somo particular- gross violation- of the
laiv, but -the .storm soon- passes./ It Is only
when the keen blade of sorrow strikes our
own heart, when the shadow, of disgrace hovers
over our own home that we are quickened Into
action, that we realize our responsibility; then
we damn the administration -and vote at the
primaries. . â¢ r*j \u25a0\u25a0â¢\u25a0
Do you suppose the saloon hian who re
ceives the bulk of his patrons' wages cares a
rap whether the nearby butcher or grocer gets
his money Saturday night? Will the poolseller
who makes up a sack to go to Sacramento to
pay into the willing hands of some 'of our legis
lators so that the will of the pople be defeated,
care, if the money he Is receiving should be
used to keep the home over the family? "Will
the man who runs the fancy restaurant with
those aulet back rooms, where your-daughter
is filled with liquor and ruined, care, for the
disgrace of your child or the anguish of your
wife? Do any of these easy money tribes care
If our Insane asylums aro filled, 1 our. prisons
and our poorhouses overflowing with the freight
of 'wrecked, diseased, sin ' laden... lives, ' our
morgue the finish of so many tragedies?
So lonsr as money is easy. It matters : ot
to them what "tears and blood are shed to pay
the cost. â¢ Think of .the sacrifices of morals,
the degradation, the' crime, the - misery that
those misguided creatures pay to furnish luxur
ies to corrupt officials to furnish the means to
the briber and- the corruptlonlst. And so long
as the people sit Idly by and permit these con
ditions to continue so lone will -the lid be off
San Francisco,- so, long will -the people pay a
ccstly price- to-.hav* a wide-open- town, so
long, will San Francisco give joy to -the' forces
of Satan and.be the cornerstone of hell.
POWER OF THE POLICE.
' There- ls.no good reason why this city should
not be clea'n/.and It Is in the hands of young
mento makÂ« It so tt they desire. The U5O
men in the Police Department can, clean up
this town', and make it as wholesome as any
city In Hh# country, t belheve that the great
majority of i the members of the Police Depart
ment are honest men and would, rather \u25a0 per
form honest,, effective duty than not do It, and
I know that If the orders were given, without
a string to- them; that within sixty days they
could ajid would drive â¢ every ', violator of "the
law, every poolseller/- gambler and thief out of
business. But to brine this condition of public
decency to pass, you would need a' Police Com
mission that would say* to the; Chief of Po
lice, captains, lieutenants, sergeants,: corporals
and patrolmen "Do â¢; your 1 sworn -duty,'- clean
up the tewn or we will, dismiss, you from the
department!" . You would need a* Mayor 'who
â¢vould say to the Police â¢ Commissioners, "The
Police Department Is- in. 1 ypur- hands. A dis
graceful condition exists hfre; you must see to
it that the Police "Department \u25a0 does >- Its full
duty nnd if. you do not'.lt.wiH be my painful
duty to remove/you from office so that J can
secure men ' t â¢who will obey â¢my \u25a0 instructions."
Then above . all these . you need an I awakened
public conscience. -. .-, ...
Common honesty should be the foundation of
our politics and men should not follow the dic
tates of party unless 1 If Is right.' We may dis
agree as to a political doctrine, but we. need
never disagree : when a ' condition ,of affairs
presents Itself that els ruinous;- to the moral
life of the community.". 'Then' we' should lay
aside our partisanship, and \u25a0 all good men â¢ of :
whatever political namo should unite In a com
mon cause for the protection .of ; homes and
firesides, and for -civic decency and honor. >

.Did not the Mayor about a year ago ac
knowledge himself that "gambling has been
carried on at- an immense profit? That a cor
ruption fund ' termed the. Gamblers' Society
License has been collected, and that the money
has passed through the hands of the men who
were intrusted with- the work' of blackmailing
â¢the gamblers,- and that "these things -have
long dlssraced the city"? But who sowed
these ' dragons' teeth? Did not Mayor Schmitz
with his own ham! sign the ordinance that
licensed' the gambling plant at Ingleslilf'? â¢ \u25a0

PISCAED OWN CLICHES
Array TJiemselves in Daugh
ter's Expensive Garments
arid Steal Valuable Doll
Assemblyman Thomas E. Atkinson was
startled on Saturday afternoon on return
ing to his -home at 10C9 Shrader street to
flnd that it had been entered by burglars
during his absence; He notified the Gold
en Gate park station and. Detectives Gor
ham and Shea hurried to the residence..
The officers found that entrance had
been effected by cuftlng the wire screen
and breaking the glass of the. rear win
dow. A thorough search had been made
for plunder, but .although there was a
quantity of silverware in the dining room
and jewelry in the bedrooms neither was
touched. The strange , feature of the bur
glary was that nutiiing was taken except
clothing and trinkets belonging to At
kinson's daughter and a doll valued at
$15 and the doll's carriage.
A further search; disclosed the cast off
clothing of two "girls which had been
thrown into a closet. This led to the be-;
llcf that these two girls, whoever they
were, had broken Into the house and ar-'
rayed themselves In ! the expensive ' gar
ments belonging to Miss Atkinson after
discarding their own. . :
Suspicion fell upon two girls named Jor
dan, whose, mother lives in the neighbor
hood. Their father was a fireman, but de
serted his., wife some years ago and was
last heard* of in the Klondike. One" of the
sons has been in trouble several times.
A visit was paid . to the mother's house
by the officers and part of the stolen
clothing was recovered. Yesterday every
thing was brought back. No action
\u25a0will be taken:, against the young girls.
He insisted that the mother should be
arrested, but the police pointed out to him
that there was nothing against her.
GIVES WIFE BEATER
TASTE OF OWN GAME
Edward D uggan Thoroughly
Thrashes George JKodgerd,
v â¢aDruninier.
Wife, beating in a public place proved
a disastrous undertaking, for George H.
Rodgers, a drummer who resides at the
Hotel Higgins. Last night when he
let fly a left hook which, landed on his
wife's, left eye while they- were stand
ing at the corner of Post street and
Gnint avenue, Edward Duggan, who
happened to be passing, gave Rodgers
a taste of his own game. - Just what he
did to tue drummer is told in detail
on the register at- the Central Emer
gency Hospital.
,: Duggan, who lives on. Verona street,
showed an excellent knowledge of Lon
dori, pj^ize-ring rules,: for early: in the
fray lie liad the drummer rolling^ in the
gutter. Not content with this, hV tried
to make a sweeping machine out of
Rodgers. While the fight was at its
height and the crowd was enjoying* it
immensely the. ambulance and the. po
lice'were on their way to the scene.
Rodgers was -taken to the \u25a0 hospital,
where Dr. Herzog treated him, and as
he fully realized that he deserved the
beating he. refused . to;prosecuttÂ» Dug

The Murphy button, well known In
surgory, has a companion Just discov
ered by. A. Glover, assistant surgeon of
tho Emergency Hospital staff, in this
city. The discovery was made at* the
Central Hospital at. the City Hall yes
terday forenoon, when August Sandow,
of 251 Octavia street, walked into the
hospital, leading his six-year-old son
August and demanding the attention of
the surgeon. On being, interrogated as
to his trouble^ he said his son's lips
had been closed by a Schmitz button.
The removal of a 'bandage which Mrs.
Sandow had carefully, tied over her off
springes mouth revealed the truth, for
in plain view/ was a big red - button
with photo of the man who expects to
be his own successor. Tlie button, af
ter, being placed in the mouth of. the
young Schmitz advocate, - worked ij its
way down between the .lower "jaw teeth
and forced the pin- through the outer
surface in such a way as to baffle the
ingenuity, of .the. child's parents to ex
tract it. So deep. was it imbedded that
Dr. Glover had to cut it out "of, the skin.
Shot Himself Tbrongh the Head.
John ' Pa'hl, 'a stableman, formerly of
149 Ninth street, sent a 44-caliber. Eng

a blind alley j known as Manning place
yesterday afternoon. No cause was
made known, other . than \ that '.he had
been out of employment for some. time
and been a free patron of a saloon in
the- neighborhood. In response to the
telephone the ambulance ' with Dr.

message and had. the. injured and dying

CRUISER FALKITS SURGEOX
CAUGHT BY POLICEMAN
Guest* of Dr. E. Stelxner Are Nabbed
After Lonar Chase for Breaking
Speed . Ordinance.
Yesterday in Golden Gate Park wa*j
a busy day for the mounted police"
who were compelled to be on the alert
0.v.-Jng to the infractions of the ordi
nance by some of the many automo
blllsts. Four victims were caught in the
official clutches and obliged to take a
policeman in their machines to the
Hall of Justice In order to be bailed
out.
The most exciting chase of the day
was that of Patrolman E. J. McKevitt,
who was mounted on a motor cycle and
discovered that an auto was exceeding
the speed limit. McKevitt called upon
the occupants to stop, and the result
was an increase of the auto's speed.
McKevitt turned his motor to, the last
notch - and after a chase captured the
lawbreakers. The victims turned out
to be Dr. E.-9telzner, owner of the ma
chine, and his guests, the chief surgeon
of the German cruiser Falke and two
lady friends.
The day was ideal in the park, and
thousands visited the playgrounds,
bandstand and places of Interest. Other
thousands thronged the Chutes, but the
high wind at the~beach rendered loung
ing a discomfort and few remained
more than a few minutes., >% 'v .
