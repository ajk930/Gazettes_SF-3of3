POSTMASTER GENERAL
- 1 MAKES SUGGESTIONS
According to - Mrs. Armstrong, who
arrived from" Woodland to-day, Gost
lin had threatened her husband's life
while in k Chicago. Gostlin has a rich
brother living in Chicago, but he
himself has nothing but his interest in
the Golden West mine. He has a wife
and several children living -at Iowa
Hill. but. has not been with them
for some time. He is 62 years of age.
Armstrong was born at Iowa Hill and
was 37 years of age. His wife was
Miss Freeman, daughter of a wealthy
cattleman of Woodland.
, J. r K. SteDhens of Etna Mills, Siski
you County, was sitting in the seat
with Armstrong. He says Gostlin came
up from behind and without warning
fired three shots at Armstrong. Two
of the bullets took effect. Stephens
says that Armstrong was partly asleep
at the time. Mrs. Dolbert Baxter cor
roborates Stephens' statement, as does
Conductor R.' W. Bryce.
Gostlin-' was in Auburn Saturday
morning and went to Sacramento. It
is said that he was seen at the depot
when the Coif ax train pulled out at
5 o'clock, Lut did not get aboard. Arm
strong was not wholly ignorant of the
possible fate that awaited Him, as he
had remarked to several that Gostlin
had threatened'to kill him and a loaded
pistol was found !n his overcoat pocket.
. ArmstrqngÂ»jLnd -Gostlin. .were parties:
to a rniiiing^sutt -which ,- ; was --to' li'ave
been tried: to-morrow. . Some' time' ago
they had a dispute over a' portion of
the Golden West mining claim at Can
ada Hill, Placer County, and Arm
strong, who was selling stock, agreed
to pay; Gostlin $10,000 if he would com
promise. Some months ago Gostlin met
Armstrong In Chicago and tried to col
lect the money, but Armstrong claimed
that it, was not due at that time. The
present suit was the outcome.
AUBURN, Jan. 10.â Thomas Gostlin^
who shot and killed Edward Armstrong
last night on the midnight overlahd
train between Newcastle and Auburn,
will 'not 'explain completely the causes
which led to the tragedy. He declared
last night when he gave himself up to
Constable Hoffman that he was not
sorry.
Special Dispatch to The Call
At daylight this morning a small
fleet of tugs and sfam launches set out
to cruise in the straits and many par
ties proceeded along the foreshore. The
quarantine tug Earie, when on her way
to the city found the body of a woman

Thomas Sullins drifting toward Albert
Hf-ad, and later the remains of two
other women were found floating
among drifting freight and wreckage.
Neither of these have been identified so
far.
The tug Albion, which encircled Dis

we're lowered and capsized in the sight
of survivors, drowning their occupants,

in the seas, with an oar still in place.
Shore boats put off to bring the boat In.
It was No. 3 starboard lifeboat and was

The idea that the world originated as

Chamberlln and his associates* Their
new view of the globe's or I ein is that
the earth was - built- up gradually by

These bits fell so rapidly as to become

LONDON, Jan. lo.â It is learned on the highest authority that it has been decided, in the event of war. -between Russia and' Japan, that Germany will.maintain strict neutrality and that' other members -of -the dreibund
will observe a similar attitude. The importance of this decision, which will almost immediately be announced in some official .manner , in .Berlin, cannot be easily overestimated.. It \vill in a measure insure that hostilities will be con
fined to the two powers concerned, and may give a stimulus to the efforts which France fcrid. Great Britain are. making iir; St: Petersburg and Tokio, respectively, in favor, of peace*. | "While -the advices from continental capitals to-day
are more hopeful, the optimistic feeling is not borne out by dispatches. from the Far East.\ Russia is pouring nicjre : 'troops into /Manchuria,-;thc : traffic^ncidehtallo;niilitary: movements, being so heavy as to congest the railroads.

According to - Mrs. Armstrong, who
arrived from" Woodland to-day, Gost
lin had threatened her husband's life
while in k Chicago. Gostlin has a rich
brother living in Chicago, but he
himself has nothing but his interest in
the Golden West mine. He has a wife
and several children living -at Iowa
Hill. but. has not been with them
for some time. He is 62 years of age.
Armstrong was born at Iowa Hill and
was 37 years of age. His wife was
Miss Freeman, daughter of a wealthy
cattleman of Woodland.
, J. r K. SteDhens of Etna Mills, Siski
you County, was sitting in the seat
with Armstrong. He says Gostlin came
up from behind and without warning
fired three shots at Armstrong. Two
of the bullets took effect. Stephens
says that Armstrong was partly asleep
at the time. Mrs. Dolbert Baxter cor
roborates Stephens' statement, as does
Conductor R.' W. Bryce.
Gostlin-' was in Auburn Saturday
morning and went to Sacramento. It
is said that he was seen at the depot
when the Coif ax train pulled out at
5 o'clock, Lut did not get aboard. Arm
strong was not wholly ignorant of the
possible fate that awaited Him, as he
had remarked to several that Gostlin
had threatened'to kill him and a loaded
pistol was found !n his overcoat pocket.
. ArmstrqngÂ»jLnd -Gostlin. .were parties:
to a rniiiing^sutt -which ,- ; was --to' li'ave
been tried: to-morrow. . Some' time' ago
they had a dispute over a' portion of
the Golden West mining claim at Can
ada Hill, Placer County, and Arm
strong, who was selling stock, agreed
to pay; Gostlin $10,000 if he would com
promise. Some months ago Gostlin met
Armstrong In Chicago and tried to col
lect the money, but Armstrong claimed
that it, was not due at that time. The
present suit was the outcome.
AUBURN, Jan. 10.â Thomas Gostlin^
who shot and killed Edward Armstrong
last night on the midnight overlahd
train between Newcastle and Auburn,
will 'not 'explain completely the causes
which led to the tragedy. He declared
last night when he gave himself up to
Constable Hoffman that he was not
sorry.
Special Dispatch to The Call
At daylight this morning a small
fleet of tugs and sfam launches set out
to cruise in the straits and many par

knots' speed is 4000 miles with 1100 tons
of coal in bunkers.^
The Kasago and Nlsshin, as the ships
have been named by the Japanese, are
7700 tons displacement, 357 feet length,
61 feet 6 inches breadth and 23 feet
mean draught, fitted with two sets of
triple expansion three cylinder" engines
of 13,500 horsepower, calculated to give
a speed of twenty knots. The builders
suggested the installation of Niclausse
boilers, but the Argentina officers pre
ferred cylindrical boilers, with the
handling of which they were more fa
miliar. The normal coal carried Is 650
tons and the bunker capacity 1100 tons.
The armor belt is six inches thick amid
ships, tapering to 4% inches at ends;
the . two turrets and barbettes 5Vs . in
ches; bulkheads 4% inches; protective
deck, on slopes, yk inches and the con
ning tower 4% inches,'; AIT" the armor is
from the Ferhie works. The armament
of the Kasaga consists of one 10-lnch
gun of 45 caliber in the forward tur
ret, two 8-inch in the after turret, four
teen 6-inch, of which eight fire fore or
aft and six broadside; t a 12-pounders
and two Maxims, besides four above
water torpedo tubes protected by fr-inch
armor. The 6-inch battery is protected
by 6-Inch armor. The battery of the
Xisshin differs from that of the Kasaga
only m the substitution of two 8-inch
guns in thfir forward turret in place of
one 10-inch. All the guns are of El
wick manufacture. - '
The two ships purchased by Japan
from the Argentine are not battleships,
but armored cruisers. They were built
by the world renowned Ansaldo flfm
at Sestre Ponente, near Geneva, Italy,
and were contracted for in' January,
1902, at a cost of $3,400,000 for each,
besides a large premium if completed
within two years. The original names
of the vessels. General MItra and Gen
eral Roca, were subsequently changed
to Rivadavia and Moreno. Their res
pective keels were laid March 14, 1902.
and March 29. 1902, and the launching
came off October 22,. 1902, and February
9. 1903, since Which. Work has not been
hastened, as Argentina and Chile had
agreed; upon disarmament of their
fleets. The two shijja are identical in
all particulars except armament, i and
are of the improved Garibaldi type of
which the Spanish armored cruiser
Cristobal Colon, sunk on! Santiago
July 3, 1838, was a noted example of the
successive development of armored
cruisers on displacements from 6800 to
7700 tons. -

- "Undoubtedly ' the : United." States,

ly expect that its trade will not suffer
by Russian possession of Manchuria,
and* it would' be tactless on America's
part to demand now what she could
gain peacefully when . everything
Quiets down."
The- most reliable news* received
here is that the mass of Russian
troops in the Far East are concen
trated at Vladivostok, or on the
northern frontier of Korea. A trav
eler, who has. lately returned from the
Far East, estimates that between 100,
000 and 200,000 soldiers were in the
vicinity of Vladivostok. He surmised
that the Russians would occupy Nor
thern Korea, but believed that the
possible collision was not imminent
for a month or more, when taking
into consideration, distances and the
difficulties of marching.
ST. PETERSBURG. Jan. lO.-^-Com
menting on the possibilities of Japan
ese vessels employing the British flag,
the Novoe Vremya contends that the
customs of civilized states require that
warships shall sail under their own
national flags and adds: \,
"One can run away, but not fight
under a foreign flag. According to
international law. the British flag has
not the privilege of protecting all
these cowards who might hoist it."
Referring to the interest of the
United States in the situation, the
Novoe Vremya says:

"i:u8sia will certainly, not submit' to
dictation at the hands of any power as :
to. the protection of her legitimate in
terests in Manchuria. Negotiations
are progressing between. St. Peters-
burg and Peking in the effort to reach
an agreement adequately ..protecting
.the special pr predominant, irifluence
exercised by Russia, in Manchuria and
which has been recognized by all the
powers signatory to the . peace* pro
tocol, verbally or jn writing. At the
time of the signing, of. that convention
It was ; Russia's hope' that^she could
with Safety withdraw her, foVces frorrj
Manchutta;la8t';pct.bbe,r and leave the
protection -of. heVinterests â¢ to China.
In the meantime, 1 '^however, it was
clearly demonstrated' that* the guar
antees offered by. China were wholly
insuflicient and it b-scarrre necessary,
for ;.UÂ»e Russian Government to . a5k
for additional guarantees. Until these
have been arranged for the Russian
Government cannot be expected to
withdraw from Manchuria and thus
menace- the many Russian lives and*
forfeit, the 5350,000,000 which has
been spent there in the civilization and j
development of that province, i'.', .!
"Russia is ready and anxious to stim
ulate the development .of foreign com
merce in Manchuria, The growth 'of
trade means the success of the Siberian
railway. Russia believes, however, that ;
this commercial development is possible
without the establishment of spheres of
political influence in the open ports. I
"It will be an interesting bit of infor
mation to the Russian Government to
know that the primary object of the'
Tokio negotiations, so far as Japan is '
concerned, is the protection of Ameri
can anti English interests in the Far ;
East. Russia had supposed that Japan
was influenced by less unselfish mo

WASHINGTON, Jan. 10,â By Â¦ an

/'In view of the wide circulation
given reports, without basis in fact,
charging Russia with hostility to

It seems that the attitude of Russia
should be again defined.
"Rusisa has repeatedly expressed

"Under the" guise of the Russo-Jan
anese dispute, in short, the. lion and
the bear are preparing to grapple in' a
life or death struggle and it is the dim
perception of this that forces Â¦ the
world to follow the preliminary phases
of the duel with such passionate inter
est." x
"The fact is England has far more
at stake than Japan. Either the ter
ritorial expansion of Russia must be
arrested definitely or England's aspira
tion to commercial supremacy in the
Far East must remain an unfulfilled
dream. . . - , ,~c
cificward of Russia and the extension of
her influence in the Far East
"Very little more remains for her to
accomplish before she ! can enter upon
the work, of -realizing her ambition to
predominate in China, an ambition
which England also nourishes, and one
or the other must fail. There is not
room for both.
"One more step successfully taken,
the absorption of. Korea within Russia's
sphere of control, and she has won the
game. Her position is impregnable.
Peking is under her thumb and the
whole of China lies at her mercy.,
"This will be made abundantly clear
by a glance at the map. What ef
fective opposition could England
bring to bear against designs upon the
Chinese .empire with*, Russia firmly
established in Korea, controlling Man
churia, in possession of "the lines of
communication that drain an im
mensely rich-expanse of territory with
unlimited resources to the hardy, fru
gal, warlike population and with the
prestige of victory that is an irresisti
ble m,oral force with al! Asiatics?
"England could *do nothing. It is
her realization of the fact that makes
one fear for the maintenance of peace.
The success of Russia in the diplo
matic negotiations now pending means
more than a triumph over Japan â U
means the irremediable defeat of Brit
ish asDirations in the Far East.
"When this js recognized it becomes
easy to account for the - provocative
tone of the English press, which is in
such curiously pronounced contrast to
the attitude of. the British Govern
ment. It becomes easy to. explain the
hints that Great Britain cantjot or will
not allow her ally, Japan, to be
crushed. Either the quarrel is Japan's
or â is it England's? If it Is Japan's
and she chooses to go to war to settle
the matter, why should she not be
crushed if Russia is more powerful?

"Hear you-all going to Texas," said
the native.
"Yes: going to Dallas County."
"Well, I wish you'd look up my

The native then went and had a

"I hear you-all are going to Texas?"
"Yes."
"Well, if you-all run across my
brother down there tell him I am fine
and that everything is going along all
right."
The man who was going to Texas
promised and the native dropped into
the saloon and had some more drinks.

The new St. Peter's school building,
Alabama street, between Twenty
fourth and Twenty-fifth streets, was
dedicated yesterday afternoon by
Archbishop George Montgomery.
There was an immense gathering of
parishioners and friends from outside
the parish, and numerous priests as
sisted at the imposing ceremonies.
Exactly on the hour appointed, 4
o'clock, Archbishop Montgomery, head
ed by acolytes and thirty sanctuary
boys and the clergy, formed a proces
sion from St. Peter's Church to the
school, which adjoins the place of
worship.
On reaching the main entrance of
the school the Archbishop sprinkled
the doors with holv water, and at the
same time the bells of St. Peter's
chimed and the strains of a joyous
melody came from the organ. Each
room was visited and blessed by the
Archbishop, and on his return to the
church he delivered a sermon appro
priate to the occasion.

LOS ANGELES, Jan. 10.â A large
automobile took a leap off Raymond
Hill bridge at Pasadena at 11 o'clock
this morning and sent two of its oc
cupants crashing on a railroad track
thirty feet below. The third man
grabbed hold of the bridge and hung
there, fanning the air with his legs
until he had to let go from exhaustion
and dropped 'to the ground. The mir
aculous part of the affair is that no
body was hurt beyond a few bruises.
John Pearson, a professional chauf
feur of Los Angeles; Tom Pillow, a
colored chauffer of Pasadena, and W.
E.-Holccrmb. a friend of Pearson, were
In the accident. Pearson .was treating
his frieads to a trial of "a new four
seater that welshed about two tons.
He drove it to Pasadena.
The bridge on which the accident
happened spans the Santa Fe and Salt
Lake Railroad tracks. -It also spans
a cut for the abandoned California
cvcleway. Between this cut and the
Santa Fe tracks is a wall of earth fif
teen feet thick that reaches up to
within seven or eight feet of the
bridge. When the auto car dashed
through the frail side of the bridge,
tearing away the 1 railing, its front
wheels, dropping suddenly downward,
lodged firmly in this little embank
ment, leaving the rear wheels clinging
to the rim of the bridge. It was this
sudden stop that hurled the occupants
of the car with such force and also
had the effect of keeping the automo
bile from landing on top of Its passen
gers.

! who attempted to rob them in their car
| late Wednesday night. The confession
j was made to Warden Wright, Chief of

] the State penitentiary, where Shockley
t has been confined since Thursday night,
when a mob of enraged street car men
made an unsuccessful attempt to batter
down the doors of the City Prison In
order to get the prisoner and lynch
him.
In his confession Shockley declares
; that he had no intention of killing his
I victims, but that they put up such a
1 vicious fight when he attempted to rob
! them that he was forced to shoot them
i in self-defense. After the tragedy, he
! says, he contemplated suicide, but his
! nerve failed him when he put the pistol
i to his head. Shockley says he is heir
! to considerable property, and he wants
| to sign this over to aid the families of
j Ins victims. He says his parents live
â¢ in Maries County, Missouri.
Evidence which Shockley placed at
j the disposal of the officers goes far to
< prove the truth of his confession. In a
I second confession Shockley admits that
j he participated in a hold-up last July,
| in which he fired several shots at the
! conductor.
After making bequests to his chil
dren, Dr. Winslow in his will requests
that after his death his heart be cut
cut, embalmed, enclosed in a glass ves
sel and placed in the coffin of his moth
er on the Island of Xantucket. In a
similar vessel he, requests that the ash
es of his cremated body be buried with
the body of his wife in a cemetery near
Cambridge, Mass. As there had been
but two previous cremations in the
United States and none In Utah, con
siderable difficulty was found In carry-
Ing out this request, it being necessary
to construct a temporary furnace in
the heart ct the city at a cost of $1500.

York, asking for information regarding
the dlSDOsltlon made of the estate of
her grandfather. Dr. Charles Frederick
Winslow. an eccentric but brilliant
naturalist who died in this city in 1S77
leaving a valuable estate. This con
sisted mainly of personal property, in
cluding a large and valuable collection
of shells, fossils, minerals, antiquities
and rare books, three volumes of the
latter alone being valued at $10,000. An
examination of the public records fails
to disclose what became of this prop
erty.
The will is dated May 3, 1876, and
names Samuel Woodward (now deceas
ed) as temporary administrator and
Joseph Shlppen and Charles W. Win
slow of St. Louis and William C. Pease
of San Francisco as executors.

i ies deserve. For several years I was
bothered more or less with kidney com-
plaint, particularly if I contracted a
oold, which was sure to seat Itself in the
rejricm of my back just over the kidneys.

medicine of various kinds, none of which
f-ven helped, and finally Mrs. Collins,
who had been reeding considerable about
Uoan's Kidney Pills, advised me to take
a course ol the treatment. If the first
box had not brought results 1 can posi-

TACOMA, Wash., Jan. .10.â For

died when the tide went out, and the
bottom of the channel is covered with
dead flsh for two miles. In some
places they, are two and a half feet
thick and nowhere less than a foot.

Immediately there was confusion. The
speaker was joined -by two others and
standing in the pew they defied the
men of the meeting to attack them.
A rush was being made for the three
men when the priest told his congre
gation to let them depart in peace.
Ihe priest later said the disturbance
was not raised because of. the sisters,
but because the anarchists had de
clared his life forfeited. The reason
for this, he is unable to explain. He
said a band . of anarchists exists in
this city and holds regular meetings.
He safd he learned this from Law
rence Pious, a college chum of his in
Russia, who drew the lot which made
him the choice of the "reds" to mur
der President McKinley. Pious refused
to carry out the plot and fled to Michi
gan, where he died. Father Sutkeiteis
told the police that he was convinced
the anarchists were preparing to take
his life and to-niffht his residence is
being strongly guarded by officers.

Rev. Father Sutkeiteis, as anarchists,
and he boldlv declared that they were

President McKinley.
The occasion of the trouble was a
meeting to arrange for work in paro
chial schools of the church. The use
fulness of the sisters in this work
had just been praised by one of the
speakers, when a man in the audience
arose and said: "We will not have the
sisters. They are not good women, and
being such should not have control of
our children."

The ill-health of himself and his wife

from St. Mark's a month ago. after ac

Outward Demonstrations Are Made
Against the Appointment of
Monstgnor Nozalrdn.
ROME. Jan. 10. â Vatican authorities
are greatly displeased because of the
Spanish demonstrations against Mon
slgnor Nozaleda, former Archbishop of
Valencia. It Is said at the Vatican that
the appointment was Intended to grati
fy the Sp.anish people, as the Arch
bishop was one of Spain's own prelates
who was struck most severely by the
Spanish-American war, and who
through that war lost the prominent
position which he held In the Philip
pines. The Vatican now finds that the
appointment has caused general dis
satisfaction and while some persons
look upon it as displeasing to Ameri
cans it has undoubtedly failed to please
the Spaniards.

LONDON, Jan. 11.^ â An acrimonious
correspondence between the Duke of
Devonshire and Joseph Chamberlain is
published this morning. The Duke,
who is president of the Liberal Unionist
Association, formed at the time the !
Liberal party split on the home rule j
question, wrote to Chamberlain sUg- j
Resting that the association should be j
dissolved, owing to the difficulty of lo- j
cation of the funds, now that the party
had become divided by the fiscal con
troversy. V.
Chamberlain, in a long rejoinder,
said he thought it best to "let sleeping Â¦
dogs lie." but that if the Duke cf J
Devonshire wanted to make a fiscal j
test question he had "best take a vote j
of the members of the association and j
let the defeated party retire." j
The Duke replied, objecting to such I
a violent disruption of the association. I
and asking for a friendly discussion of
the arrangements for dissolution. j
Chamberlain closed the correspon- j
dence by announcing that, as the j
Duke will not accept his views, he i
was determined to call a meeting on j
his own responsibility and the course '
to be pursued would be decided at ,
this meeting. The correspondence be- j
tween the Duke of Devonshire and
Chamberlain is considered as complet- j
ing the disruption of the Unionist j
party. . .

ALAMEDA. Jan. 10.â Home building,
house renting and sales of lots in this
<ity have picked up so much in the last
few weeks, despite the lull in real es
tate business that Is expected during
the holiday reason, that local realty
dealers are preparing for a boom with
the new year. Many houses are now in
course of erection throughout Alameda
and several of them are pretentious
residences. Modern Fix-room cottages
eannoi be secured, and the demand for
such abodes has been for a year far
greater than the supply. Here is what
eome of the realty brokers say relative
to the situation, present and future:

which the view was taken an observer
may look straight out through the
Golden Gate.

"The month of January Is always
more or leps dull, but we have had
more inquiries as to locations and
prices so far this month than during
the same time last year and at present
It looks as if the sales this year will
exceed those of 15Â»03."
Youngs & Barry of Berkeley have is
sued an elaborately illustrated folder
and property list of Berkeley real es
tate. The folder contains engravings
of all the more important busings
blocks and many of the handsome resi
dences of the college city, and among
the illustrations is a general view of the
new Greek amnhitheater at the univer
sity.
The first month of the year, succeed
ing as it does the holiday season, is
always dull for realty dealers, but
nearly all of th*- local firms report
more than the ordinary amount of bus
iness, and all say that the outlook for
the coining spring is brighter than it
has ever been before. H. B. Belden
says :
FIRST MONTH LIVELY.
The object of the new organization
is to improve as far as possible the
< onditlons in thÂ» lo<*al market, and to
enable the members to work in har
mony with each other.
The following temporary officers were
elected at the first meeting: President.
Frank J. Woodward; secretary. Georce
W. Austin; treasurer. A. J. Snyder.
William J. Laymance and Arthur Breed
are members of the temporary execu
tive board.

The association recently organized by
the real estate dealers of Oakland will
hold its first annual election of officers
next Tuesday evening at the Oakland
Board of Trade rooms, at which time
permanent organization will be ef
fected. At present nineteen of the
leading real estate firms of the citv are
members of the association and appli
cations for membership have been re
ceived from six others, so that when
the permanent officers are elected the
membership will include all of the
prominent real estate dealers of this
city.
The station burglar made his appear
ance last night at San Pablo, where he
broke Into the station of the Santa Fe
Railroad at that place and took ev
erything he could . gather up.
The work was evidently that of a
novice, for the window was broken and
a very rough search of the Interior of
the place was made. An effort was
made to break into the office safe,
which contained nioney and tickets,
but without success. The burglar then
turned his attention to the baggage
that had been stored in the station over
night and he broke open several trunks
and took valuables therefrom.
There have been many station robbe
ries in this neighborhood of late and
the Indications are that some one man
is making a round of all railroad prop
erty and taking, what valuables he can
find. Only a few nights ago the South
ern Pacific Company's station at the
West End, AlamÂ»da, was looted and
some money and tickets taken. A short
time prior to this burglary the station
at Mount Eden on the narrow eauee
road in this county was riOed. and Just
before that the station at Fruitvale.
Just outside Oakland, was entered and
looted.

"I do desire to say, however, In view
of rumors that have been current that
the Master Builders' Association has
not been organized to fight labor
unions. It has been said that this was
the object of our Incorporation. It has
been ' talked over in the . unions. That
is not true. Our articles nay we are
organized to . promote the Interests of
our members and to encourage a better
feeling among the building contractors,
and that is our chief purpose. Â»We hope
to improve our condition, and we are
confident that by this move we have
created a strong and substantial
body." . .
: resident Pinkerton said ho was op
posed to any publicity concerning the
organization, but he consented to make
a brief statement. In view of the fact
that the articles of. incorporation had
become a matter of public record.
"I do not feel that the time is ripe
for a discussion about he association's
plans. The articles cf incorporation
speak for themselves. We have formed
a solid and compact o a..ization. rep
resenting practically a'l of the building
contractors who make the "...uiness a
steady and permanent occupation.
There are, of course, many matters
that the associatic - . can and will
handle as part of Its work.
"There are many conditions which
might Le remedl d to the be..-!flt of the
business. For example, we ?hall bring
our members Into clor.-~ relations with
each other and thereby settle many
little difficulties that are i.lways aris
ing. We shall be able, per-iaps, to reg
ulate conditions so that cne contractor
who might be overcrowded with work
will see to it that a less fortunate
builder is supplied. That is what has
been accomplished at Sacramento.
"But It is no use to recite details, and
besides we are not ready to make pub
lic our plans. A safe business rule is
to keep your business to yo-'rself.
The officers and directors of the asso
ciation are as follows: Peter H. Pink
erton (president), F. J. Wilson (secre
tary), H. McCullough, C. F. Nichols, H.
Wharton, George Eber anl F. G. Jones.
Arnon-- the contractors who have
signed the articles of incorporation as
lncorporators are: William Davis, G.
A. Scott, J. H. Dlngwell, Charles W.
Wllkins. C. Christenson. J. F. Schrader,
D. S. Breihaut, N. Olsen, B. Pearson,
H. P. Nelson, P. J. -Jrophy, Robert
Knox. George W. Flick, . . C. Caldwell
and K. Nelson.
The total membership is about eighty.
Concerning the association's action
President Pinkerton said:
The articles of incorporation have
been flied with the Secretary of State
at Sacramento. .CT~,
Fraught with much significance to
the building trades interests is the step
in forming a corporate body by the
contractors. Divested of Its legal as
pect, it means a closer fraternity
among the builders, a nearer associa
tion with each other for the settlement
and adjustment of business conditions,
and, more than all this, the bringing
into being of a strong and solid amal
gamation of practically all of the
heaviest builders in the county.
As outlined in the articles of incor
poration, the association has been
given corporate life to encourage a
more intimate acquaintance among
the members. Its purposes, as out
lined, are to open a wÂ«y for the pre
sentation of the needs and necessities
of the contractors; to settle ail of the
disputes that might arise and in all
lawful ways to promote the Interests
of contracting builders.
The linos are made so broad that
every matter connected with the hand
ling of members' business can be
brought before the corporation for
settlement.
The corporation has been given a
life of fifty years. It is provided that
there shall be no capital stock and it
is expressly specified that the corpora
tion is not organized for pecuniary
1'lOfit.
Mutual benefit is the keynote of
the plan of Incorporation. In follow
ing this theory the association has
adopted a set of by-laws, which in de
tail cover the working plans.
Though Alameda County Is not the
first to take this important step in the
organization of employing contractors,
It follows a close second to the build
ers of Sacramento, who have incorpor
ated their association. The scheme is
being carried into other large centers
in California. In San Francisco the
builders have about arranged to throw
thÂ«?ir voluntary association Into a cor
poration, and in other cities throughout
the State the same line of action is
under consideration.
Alameda County's association was
formed about a year ago. It grew out
of a banquet given by the lumber deal
ers to the contractors. Before the first
flush of enthusiasm had waned the
membership was run up to a fair ma
jority of the builders, but It dwindled
until not more than 25 per cent of the
work was represented in the organiza
tion.
The contractors, confronted on the
one side by the steadily Increasing de
mands of the labor unions and on the
other hand by the heavy advance In
all kinds of building materials, partic
ularly lumber, felt that they were slow
ly being ground out of existence. They
were at a loss to know which way to
turn. Their association, merely a vol
untary affair, irresponsible and dor
mant, had accomplished nothing. To
revive the organization In Its unsatis
factory condition was not considered
feasible. The men who felt most seri
ously the binding state In the business
situation decided that to incorporate
was the solution. .
The Sacramento plan was investigat
ed by a committee of five Oakland con
tractors. They submitted a report that
was favorable. The association placed
its legal affairs in the hands of Attor
ney A. P. Leach and then the steps re
quired by law to give the association
corporate life were speedily taken.
The result was. that by the time the
association was ready to move the
membership had increased to a point
that covered all but about 10 per cent
of the building that is being done in
Alameda County.
In line with a movement of State
wide development, the building con
tractors of this county have organized
and have incorporated the Master
Builders' Association of Alameda
County. The embryotic voluntary as
sociation of contractors, which has
had an up and down existence in Ala
meda County for a year, has been
swallowed in the corporation that In
cludes a membership representing 90
per cent of the building work within
the Jurisdiction of the new organiza
tion.

Nora is a bright, nice-appearing
child, apparently mild mannered and
good tempered. She confessed to hav
ing run away from home on several
other occasions, being driven to _ des
peration, she said, by her mother and
brother. The child will be held till
some suitable home can be found for
her.
Nora Greeby, a iftetty 14-year-old
girl approached Patrolman Â¦William
Casey of the Mission Police Station last
night at the corner of Seventeenth and
Folsom streets and unfolded to the of
ficer a pitiful tale of abuse and neelect
she claims to have suffered at the
hands of her mother and brothers, ine
officer gave the half-famished child
some food and then took her to the
Central Emergency Hospital.
Nora's plight is a sad one and, witn
tears in her eyes and a trembling voice,
she related to the matron of the hos
pital her story- She stated that she had
resided with her mother and brother at
117 Oak street tip to two weeks ago.
According to her story, the mother and
one of her brothers, a cripple, beat and
maltreated her -at every opportunity,
till she finally decided to seek shelter
elsewhere. . _
She worked for a time In the L*
Grande Laundry, but fearing, she said,
that her mother might molest her. left
there a few days ago and took up her
abode in a deserted shack at the corner
of Geary street and Central avenue.
She slept In the hovel at night, and
wandered around among her friends
during the day. She told them that she
was paying visits, and m that way
avoided suspicion and managed to get
enough.to eat and drink, but as soon as
the shadows of night began to fall, the
child would again repair to the shack
to rest her weary limbs.
Last night she said that she was tired
and footsore from wandering about the
streets and decided to tell her story to
a policeman. Meeting Casey she con
fided in him and he took charge of her.
She said that she was fearful of being
arrested, but added that she did not
wish to return to her home again.

ROME, Jan. 10.â Martins d'Antas,
Portuguese Embassador to the Vatican
and dean of the diplomatic corps, says*
that the report that Pope Pius has
charged him to forbid women to wear
decollete gowns at receptions which are
attended by Cardinals and other prel
ates is erroneous. Emassador d'Antas
says that he last saw the Pope on De
cember 27, when he called to pay his
hoHday greetings, and that his Holi
ness, without giving injunctions or
even recommendations and more as a
joke than otherwise, said^it was de
sirable that the gowns of the women
should be somewhat high cut.

d'Antas Was More as a' Joke
Than Otherwise.

Major McClung in her apartments at

that her sudden departure had been

It was learned here yesterday that
Mrs. Colt had arranged to be absent

had turned over to the- Union Trust

Garnett's case is down on the court

The repair bill of ships of the United
States navy is getting large and in a
few years promises, to exceed the
outlay for new construction. . Mod
ern â¢ ships are costly to maintain
in a state of efficiency and a large
proportion of the money expend
ed under the head of repairs Is really
for alteration and Improvement of
ships that are rapidly becoming obso
lete. This is notably the case With the
battleships built ten years ago, and it
is"tloubtful whether it Is worth the
expense of half -a million dollars to
hull and machinery to partially recon-'
struct some of. these ships. Orders
have been issued for extensive repairs
to the Indiana, Involving an outlay of
$500,000, and not less than one year's
time, and similar repairs and, altera
tions are. intended in the near future
to the Massachusetts, Oregon and Iowa.
The cost of repairs to* the Indiana
amounts to $485,000 to the , present
time; the Massachusetts, $430,000;
Oregon, $475,000, and the Iowa. $245,000.
The Indiana wa^ placed in commission
in June, 1895; the Massachusetts and
the Oregon in June and July, 1896. and
the Iowa in June, 1897. The large re
pair bill of the Oregon is due to her be
ing run ashore on the coast of China.
Involving temporary repairs in Japan
and subsequent overhauling at the
Puget Sound naval station. The Massa
chusetts has run aground twice, neces
sitating about $250,000 repairs, but the
Indiana has always been a 'Hame djick"
and the Iowa, through defective ma
chinery and poor "workmanship, has
never' come up to the expectations
which her admirable design warranted.
Another case of chronic decrepitude is
that of the Texas, which has cost $496.
000 in repairs since August. 1895. In all
of these four ships, the Oregon ex
cepted, the trouble is of such a nature
that entire reconstruction of hull and
machinery is neceS%ary to make them
equal to ships of recent construction,
and this cannot be done within the
limit of $500,000 for each ship.

The Laurel Hall Club held one of ftie
choicest sessions of the week, at which
William H.. Mills "delivered an address
upon J'The Forestry Policy of ,the Unit
ed States Government." The leading
facts brought out by; Mr. Mills were
"the unalterable, determination of the
Government not to sell any . more of .the
forested lands; that public ownership
was a necessity^ and also logical. Inas
much 'as- denuding I a " forest despoiled
the : homes ".of 'adjacent people, and,
moreover,'. Individuals cannot be de

CLUB PARTIES.
Interesting to all clubwomen is the
visit in this city of Mrs. Mary E. Hart,
who organized a club in the Land of
the Midnight Sun. She called her club
a most impossible name, but says in ex
tenuation that it really means some
thing. It is called "Kegoayah Kozga."
which, in the native tongue, means
"Aurora or Northern Lights Club."
Mrs. Hart is to be a guest of the
Papyrus C.lub on Thursday, when the
members will meet a most interestine
and charming woman.
The Jefferson Square Club, with de
lightfully appointed clubrooms in the
Pioneer Automobile building, has-been
organized, its policy outlined, arid its
facilities are almost in working;] order.
The organization Is a club of risen and
women (the ideal club), and lts^ mem
bership is confined to the members of
the Bohemian, Cosmos, Press. Univer
sity and Union League clubs, and their
women friends. Its object is to encour
age and promote bowling, a sport now
in high order In the East.

views of the beautiful old sanctuary as

carefully protected, and , the lumber on

that measures its growing wealth by
thp millions, toward the little waifs
that we pretend to be trying to save.
Can it be that, in all the, city, there
are not mm and women who care
erioujrh for the welfare of these waifs
(and future citizens) to rise and de
mand of a dull and selfish common

brought to the attention of the people â
but Oh, what a listless audience "the

Here, indeed, in the realm where wo
men â and good men â shine. Here is an
intelligent effort made to* lessen the
sorrows of the suffering, to relieve the
needyâ that .which overtops the other
aims as do the mountains the valleysâ
the savins if children from want and
Uf ally, crime.
Then the other clubs, whose sole busi
ness is to entertain and cultivate, have
been doing those things assiduously,
and doing them well.
"Wha.t are the women's clubs doing?"
What are they not doing? would be
more readily answered. Busy? Rather.
The California Club is so deep In the
throes of money-making, that the
members may dwell under their own
rooftree by the coming of the next New
Year. The Sempervirens Club is ever
*') busy drawing up resolutions for the
preservation of the forests. The Daugh
ters of the Confederacy are adroitly
patching up the little rifts In their do
mestic circle and lending a. helping
hand to the old fellows who fought for
the lost cause. .
The Press Association, though wrest
ling with Internecine strife, is strug
gling nobly to preserve an unruffled
front. And it seems to be succeeding
admirably, judging from the entertain
ment it offers to its loyal members and
their friends. How many are loyal?
Ah! that question is harder to answer
than the query relating to the age of

its 1 -. natural color. 'But our daily ex

Â¦Joseph Bosley, for twenty-one years
an officer, in the London Mendacity
Society, has done much to clear the
streets of that great city of beggars.
He recently gave a remarkable inter
view upon some of the mendicants'
tricks to a representative of the Daily
London News.
"I suppose every one has heard of
your exposure of 'Soapy Fits.* Mr.
Bosley, the man who used to lie in the
street and foam at the mouth by suck-
Ing a bit of soap?" queried the Inter
viewer.
"Yes, his name was Hurly, and he
used to try the 'shivery-shaky* dodge
and let himself down, making froth
with the soap in his mouth. He is
now in the workhouse. But there are
twoothers who still work that trick â
whenever they are-out." Bosley added
significantly. "There was another
man who used to sham fits, and !â¢
found half a^ horseshoe -sewn in his
cap. "With -this he used to make a
dreadful noise by beating his head on
the pavement when he lay down in
the streets. People thought he .must
be nearly clacking his skull."
"Do not many, beggars carry about
pictures of their, supposed accidents?**
"Yes, here are some pictures that
were carried about by a beggar who
pretended to be dumb. There you
see him on the operating table, and
the inscription says 'Going under the
chlorophorm.' Another picture is,
'Having my tongue cut out/ and you
see three or four white-haired, red
faced doctors cutting it out., with a
ting of medical students round, their
mouths open with wonder." ."; ' :

In their evident preparation for conflict Russia and
Japan continue to be- heavy purchasers #of products in

as Britain was about to intervene, a- Russian fleet of
warships sailed opportunely into the harbor of New
York. â¢- .' .â : ' . . . .
In th* event of war breaking out be
tween Japan and Russia the former
country is llkejy to witness thn Influx
< f a large number of American and
European soldiers of fortune, desirous
of placing their swords at the disposal
of the Mikado. In fact, quite h num
ber of former officers from this country,
from England, from Italy and from
Germany have alreadv arrived at To
kio for the purpose, of seeking service
under the Japanese flag. It will be just
at* well, under the circumstances, tj

the FtuBslan Government as to thn
treatment to bo accorded to AmÂ»ri.-an3

hands while fighting for the Japanese.
As a general rule, white men who are
captuxed while bearing arms with

to place the Japanese on the same levs>l

to be looked upon as the force of a civ

with any degree of justice, be consid

as the French regarded those foreign
adventurers who assisted the Black

In the corridor they, hugged and

floor below, the witness whispered to
the fair divorcee^ "Oh. dear, I was so
afraid the Judge would ask me more

have got your divorce If I had told
him it was only two bits' worth ot-

"Take your decree," said the court,
and the two women walked out of the
court, smiling and happy. ;!.. ?:'
Her complaint in divorce was a vol
uminous document. It contained alle
gations enough to brand her husband
as a man for whom the whipping post
was especially designed. But she
lacked njoof of her husband's brutal
ity, and the Judge who heard the case
refused to grant her relief, and put the
case over a week. In the meantime an
amended complaint was filed. It con
tained, in addition to the original
charges, the allegation that her hus
band had thrown a sack of" potatoes on
her, thereby causing her great suffer
ing. v
â¢ At the second hearing she testified
according to the amended complaint.
Corroborative evidence was furnished
by a neighbor, who said she saw the
potatoes thrown upon the abused wife.

CALIFORNIA PRICES- R. A.. City.
In the early days of California, as your
friend Informed you, fabulous prices
were paid for goods in the mines.
Francis D. Clark, who wrote a history
of the First Regiment of New York
Volunteers, says in that book: "The
writer passed the winter of 1S4S-1849 on
the Mokelnmne River. California, about
one mile below the hill, and the follow
ing are some of the prices paid for
clothing, provisions, etc, in that locali
ty: Flour, $1 per pound; sugar, J2; cof

per pound; salt. 51: blankets, $30 per
pair; flannel shirts, $25 each; common
boots I10O an-" common shoes $32 per
pair; Mexican serapes (shawls). $100.
The yield of gold being liberal, these
prices were cheerfully paid. As incred
ible as these prices may appear, this Is
nevertheless strictry true." .
SALUTATIONâ Subscriber. City. Tn
meeting a friend upon the street or tn
company, you should make a salutation
quietly, but cordially and with dignity,
always paying the highest respect to
the person saluted. Always salute a
lady by raising the hat and making a
formal bow. In company, the head be

sary, but in either Â«case it should be a

** 'Can .you feel it now?* No change
was noticeable. One, two, three, fourâ

"Suddenly a strange light shone in
the mahatma's eyes. He was conquer

power oÂ£ his will. Tbe pulse seemed
weaker and more alow. .,---,
"Then it stopped. There was no tap

Can Stop His Heart,
The owners of forest, lands are easily taught that their
lie in tlie proper harvesting of timber, so as to
protect the oncoming crop and make timber production
permanent. Already the redwood lumber, men "of Hum
boldt^County have asked. the services of the National Bu
reau of Forestry for instruction in the proper harvesting
of ripe timber. \ .
When it is legally determined that the private owner of
mountain forests cannot strip the land, make it non-re
ceptive of moisture, make streams torrential during rains
and dry at other times, he will do just as the hydraulic
ininer has doneâ ask the State to help him use his prop
erty beneficially, to himself and without injury to others.
This will mean no abridgment of the economic use of
t|mber. but the infinite extension of such use by making
the 'forests permanent.,
San Francisco was 'recently visited by, a timber capital
ist who was said to own half the forests of Northern Cali
fornia. He said he was not cutting now and did not care
to begin for some time. If legal regulation intervene he
will be benefited by the resulting permanency of his for
est land. Eastern lumber men have seen the evil of eradi
cating forests, and when they acquire forest land here are
found#eady to co-operate with the Government in meas
ures to make the timber permanent. An act to regulate
the use of private timber lands should be passed by the
Legislature in order that, it may go to the courts to get a
judicial r\Pirmance of the' principle. Â¦ The courts have re
cently decided that ground, waters may not be diverted
from the land owner who lias applied them to irrigation.
The removal of forests is the most serious and complete
diversion of ground \yat,ers, and the issue involved ought
to be expressed by statute anrTorought rs soon as possi
ble to the arbitrament of the courts.
voirs and that a man has no more right to destroy them
than he has to destroy an artificial reservoir.
THE State may control the use of . private timber
lands by applying the principles of the injunction
against hydraulic mining â the legal principle that
while a man'may use his own its use must not be injurious
to another. The injunction against" hydraulic mining is
sued because discharging the" debris into streams filled
their channels, destroyed their function as lines of drain
age^and when that ceased made them the means of de
structively flooding the agricultural lands of the valley,
the flood carrying with it sli'ekens, which by overlaying
the farm lands destroyed their fertility. .
If this principle deny -the destructive use of mining
lands because it causes floods injurious to agriculture it
"applies also to^hc injurious effect upon the normal run-off
of streams useful for irrigation. As it is demonstrated
that the forest is the conservator of water and that it acts
to send the moisture in the rainy season into the ground,
through which by percolation it reaches the natural drainy
age channels slowly and serves to maintain their flow for
u.se in tbe season when it is required for irrigation, and
that when the forest is removed the storm waters go im
mediately into the streams, making them torrential and
sending the water away where it is lost to use, it is evi
dent that the forested mountains are natural water reser-
"There was only one law on Nan
tucket in those days: 'No survivor from
any wreck must be allowed to land."
From this law there was no appeal and
it was enforced without mercy.
"A Nantucket boy happened to be a
member, of the crew of a^vessel lured
to destruction by one of these false
lights. H&swam ashore and was climb
ing a steep cliff when a woman's face
appeared above him. The woman
leaned over and in one hand brandished
an ax. A light flashed up from a pile
of burning wreckage and looks of mu
tual recognition passed between the
two.
"The woman hesitated. Then raised
the ax to strike.
"'You know me, mother don't you?"
cried the sailor boy.
'"Yes, John. I know you. But you
know the law!' "
JT. C.Silva, who recently visited this
city in his capacity as grand captain
of the American Association of Mas
ters apd Pilots, enlivened his official ad
dresses with anecdotes. To illustrate
one of his points .he told the following:
* "In early days the people of Nan
tucket lived by a peculiar industry.
They were not of agricultural inclina
tion and "looked for their living to the
sea, which swept their rock-ribbed
coast. They wefe fisherfolk of a kind.
Fished with lanterns, but not for fish.
It was* freight-laden ships they sought
and they preferred their game scattered
in portable pieces along the be.ach.
"A lighted lantern .tied to a cow's tail
was the usual lure. The lookouts of
ships passing in the dark frequently
mistook the moving illumination for a
light on board some vessel and in try
infg to sail within hailing distance came
to grief on the rocks. The residents of
the island gathered the* harvest as the
breaker's distributed the wreckage.

The Song of the Hammer.
We cannot pay as much of the mar
ried woman who sees a possible en
{agemfnt and marriage in every
couple that she, or chance, has thrown
together. One is almost tempted to
wonder if there is a match-making
microbe that attacks such matrons.
At all events, many of them. seem un
able to resist the temptation or fever
ish desire to marry off all their
friends. Upon their shoulders a great
responsibility rests when their efforts
are crowned with success.
Since, as we have said above, the
perfection of bliss is to be found in a
happy union, the converse is also true.
No greater misery is known than that
brought about by an unhappy mar
riage. To be tied for life (unless one
rushes with an eagerness worthy of
a better cause into the divorce court)
to an uncongenial mate, to live under
the same roof, to eat at the same
table, to share the same income, to
consider the tastes and distastes, to
receive the reproaches, to obey ihe be
hest of such an one, to humor his or
her whims â is a foretaste of that lo
cality from which the small boy de
clared the tips of matches were made.
Verily such a match as this might*be
made from, beginning to^ end in such
a place.
Knowing all this, our matchmaker
continues upon her way, playing:
providence or late to many a young
couple who were better left apart. Or,
if not better apart, they will seldom
appreciate the fact that they were
brought together by a well-meaning
friend, and if she calls their attention
to her efforts in their behalf they will
resent her suggestion. The idea!
Were they not meant fram.all eternity
for each other? Could she. or any one
else, be instrumental in bringing to
gether two persons whose affinity was
a foregone conclusion? Verily,' she
has her reward!
We may, therefore, pardon the
mother who tries to make a "good
match" for her child. If she some
times set* aside the child's wishes, in
cites her to a cold, practical consid
eration of marriage that is to be de
plored, we mnrt remember that her
overzeal is due to a great love, and
condone the c-rror for, the motive that
actuates it.
The mother knows it is truth, and
frowns upÂ»;n penniless John's suit,
knowing: that if he is accepted the pret
ty girlish hands must wa?h dishes, per
haps make fir^s. At best, there must
be the turnins and twisting of ways
Â«.nd mean?, the counting: of every live-
Ct-nt carfare, the making over of last
years dresses, the lying awake far into
the night wondering how the forth
coming bills of doctor and nurpe are Ut
be paid. Ah, let her who knows nothing
of It all forbear to smile when one says
that such experiences are perilously
near to tragedy! "He jests at scars
who never felt a wound!"
Love must be the keynote of a happy
marriage, but the keynote alone does
not make a "grand, sweet song."
This is not pessimism; it is truth.
(Cojn riÂ£ht. UOt, by Joseph B. Bcwles.)
The matchmaker rushes in where
angels fear to tread. And yet she is
no fool. And her lot ' is not an easy
one. Fhe is suspected by the world
wide, tolerated by the young and unin
itiated, and frequently ashamed of her
self. Still she exists and continues to
make matches. _
In one of the Gypsy Brenton books,
dear to the childish heart of a quarter
century apone. the small boy says that
God made matches, but that '"He used
the burning brimstone from the bad
place to put on the tips." L*ter a well
known author makes her heroine re
murk: ' MaU-hes muy be made in hea
ven, but they sometimes serve to light
thf fires cfâ well â the other place, very
effectually." The fact that the two
characters mentioned rfferred to dif
ferent kinds of matches d<>es not alter
the truth that may be drawn from both
remarks. This truth is applicable tu
the match with which we have to do
more than, to ihe innocent little wood
and brimstone article of commerce.
It is not difficult to understand why
the devoted mother attempts to have a
hand in the settling of her daughter's
marriage. She take*? it for granted that
she srtll marry â most w<Vrnen do â and
no woman knows true happiness until
fhe is a beloved and loving wife and a
Joyful mother. Is it strange, then, that
the elderly woman in whose power the
happiness or unhappiness of her child
cannot always rest longs to play des
tiny for her darling and establish her
in life as she thinks will be most con
ducive to her future welfare? To this
end she wants her girl to marry a*
gentleman, andâ here is the rock upon
which many a mother and cftild split â
a man with enough money to support
his family in comfort. The child, sur
rounded from birth Tjy every luxury,
has read of the love that can smile at
pc-verty, ar.d of "all for love and the
world well lost," and scoffs at -the
mother's desires and fears. She will
marry for love and for love only.

THE new year _ in trade, is ushered in with condi
tions unsettled, uncertain and irregular. Cold and
stormy weather has checked business in some,sec
tions, impeded transportation in others, stimulated soniej
lines of goods arid depressed others. In the- iron -arid
steel industry this irregularity is conspicuous. Numer
ous . reductions in wages went into effect January X* i
and more are-contemplated, while the net earnings for ;
the last quarter of 1903 were less^ than half thdse for the ;
corresponding quarter of 1902. and the opening of the
new year showed a pronounced falling off in orders for
new business. Several sections, however, report more
steadiness in the cruder forms, with a better demand.
The net condition^of the industry, however, is by no.
means what it was at the beginning of 1903-
The woolen trade is generally quoted steady, but.-man
ufacturers are proceeding cautiously and are buyingt no
more raw wool than is necessary to .fill immediate
wants. The cotton trade is- kept in a condition of unfeÂ»t
and uncertainty bj r the feverish fluctuations of prices on
the exchanges, by the halting character of -the foreign
markets, the , deficiency in the crop : and last,, but not
least, by fhe kaleidoscopic aspect of the Russo-Japanese
complication, which changes its hue every day. Lum
ber, like iron, is unsetticd, cold weather and readjust
ment of wage scales contributing to reader the future of
the market more' or. less uncertain. In "some parts I of
the country associations of manufacturers are. being\dis
organized, with lower prices* predicted by the trade,
while other sections; report. a good export movement.
Another important branch of. trade , exhibiting this un
rest and uncertainty is provisions. Chicago reports last
week called particular attention to the fatt that the pack
ers, after collecting large lines of cured meats for some
week*, unloaded them upon outsiders and ..then" sold
heavily themselves. In consequence of this cours.e prices
have been very variable, of late, going up one day aud
down tbe next, and the. future of the^rnarket is uncertain.
The high prices of 1902 and the early- part of 190350
checked the demand for meats th^t the prices for live
stock fell off sharply, the movement of the cured product
also diminished and the outlook is regarded with dubious
eyes by many in the business.
j In fact, look where we will we "find an element of un
certainty permeating the whole trade- situation. There
is' no apprehension of any pronounced depression in the
near future and no financial stringency is feared, as the
country was never more liberally, supplied with money,
than at present, and the prosperity enjoyed by the farm
ers during the past several years "lias placed the nation
on a solid basis, with greatly reduced foreign obligations
as an additional source of strength; but the readjustment
of general trade from fe,verish expansion to conservative
contraction is .so widespread and produces such widely
varying conditions that accurate forecasts of" the differ
ent markets are impossible.
It is this feeling of uncertainty which is checking
trade on the nation's great stock exchange more than the
.threatened war, which has been largely, discounted. It
is the principal reason why stocks, which the great finan
ciers and banking interests are insistently assuring the'
public are now down to a safe purchasing basis as ah
investment proposition, do not respond by increased 'ac
tivity and hardening 'quotations. The people have not
yet made "up their minds that everything is all right.
Perhaps, were it not for the Russo-Japanese complica
tion, which upsets 'to*day the conditions, it created yes;
terday, the market ere this would have resumed its nor
mal activity; but this is mere conjecture.
It is patent, however, that speculation .in Wall street
i? at a low ebb compared with the past five years. Ac
cording to figures collated by the New York Herald the
volume of new securities listed on the Stock Exchange
in 1003 fell off more than $1,585,000,000 as compared with
1001. -In IQO.J the aggregate listings on the exchange were
$1,337,551,000. In' 1901 they were $3,565,000,000. In 1903
they were only $980,927,000, the smullcst amount since
1897. Another striking feature in thij- connection is the fact
that during 1903 the creation of rfew securities showed
more bonds than stocks, something that had not hap
"pened before since 1808, the creation of bonds during the
year being $550,717,900 and the Creation of stocks $430,
179,100. In other words the formation of ' new corpora
tions and combinations of capital were discouraged by
the banks and surplus revenues were devoted to-improv
ing and strengthening existing corporations rather than
to creating new ones, as was the case in 1901 and 1902.
There is no question that the American stock market
is on a much safer and sounder basis than at any time
for four or five years back; the jeeling in it is conserva
tive, dealings are characterized by commendable caution
and the great abundance of money accessible to every
body is a source of satisfaction and confidence rather
than*,, a temptation to rush into the stock market blindly
and speculate in the first thing that happens to catch the
A feature of the past week was the decline in the bank
clearings of ,26.5 per cent, compared with the same week
in 1903, with all the important cities except' Kansas City
arid New Orleans - showing a loss. Such a general de
crease has not happened for a long time. Even San
Francisco, which for a year or so has been sending in
most excellent, clearing reports, has' recently been ar
rayed among the cities showing a decrease, , though
there was an increase last week." The failures for the
week were 262, against 336 in the corresponding week
last year.
With the exception of the dry weather which has pre
vailed this season conditions in California continue ex
cellent. AH branches of trade are reported in good
shape, money is abundant, crop prospects,^except in the
southern part of the State, are satisfactory and the farm
ers bid fair to realize gooci prices for their produce this
year. Hence the feeling throughout the State is' one of

â¢To my mind the aristocrat of the
hammer kind Is the elegant chipping or
engineer's hammer, with Its slim, grace
ful handle. It's worth golngaconsidera
able distance to see a man who knows
how to use this hammer. It's a fine illus
tration of implicit self-confidence. He
clasps the handle near the end. swings
the hammer with a full-arm movement
which brings ft down on the cold chisel
with all the snappy vigor of a strong
man. peeling off the iron chips as
though the metal were soft pine. If he
were at all concerned as to the safety
of his knuckles no man could use the
chipping hammer with any degree of
force â he would simply tap the cold
chisel with timid, noneffectlve blowsâ a
useless performance.
"The oddest shaped hammers are
thope used by the file and saw makers.
Although machine-made nies are" tak
ing the place of the hand-made article
to a large extent, the filecutters of
Sheffield". England, continue to use their
coffin-shaped hammers, cutting the
teeth on files wilh a dexterity little
short of the wonderful. The fllecutter's
hammer head is long andÂ»coffin-shaped,
with the handle set not in the middle,
but far to one end. The handle is short
and curved, so that in striking the file
cutter secures what might be called a
pulling blow, which not only raises the
tooth of the file, but gives it the hook
shaped burr which was the despair of
makers of' filecutting machines for
years. The peculiar shape of the ham
mer and handle also enables the work
man to .give a strong blow without lift
ing the ha*mmer far from the chisel,
and also allows him to give delicate lit
tle love taps for making smoother cuts.
"The 'dog head,' used by sawmakers
in straightening and giving tension to
saw blades, has a strong family re
semblance to the fileeutter's hammer.
It is triangular-shaped; the rounded
base of the triangle Â¦ is used for the
striking face. The handle sets into the
small end of the head and fs straight;
Few craftsmen show more skill In
using hammers than the sawmaker,
for it requires years of experience to
train the workman to strike the right
kind of a b'ow on exactly the right
spot to regulate the tension, the spring
or tempered saw blades. The -saw
maker also uses a cross-faced hammer,
and the twist hammer, which has the
harryner head set at an angle to the
handle." â¢ *
"Speaking of hammers, I suppose that
before long the ring of; the hand ham
mer will not be heard in machine shops.
The pneumatic hammers, steam ham
mers and the like are displacing the
chipping, riveting, sledge and mechan
ics' hammer. It's a pity, too, for the
hammer probably is the oldest of tools.
I am told that the prehistoric. mechanic
just naturally took a water-worn stone
in his hand, and there Vas a hammer;
that he nex*. put the stone : in the \fork
of a branch, twisting grasses or tough,
flexible twigs around it, and had a
hammer with a handle, the first- man
made tool. Whoever invented the ham
mer invented the one tool which is
common to all crafts, and yet which
lends itself so happily to" the peculiar
needs of each craft that it "assumes
more forms and shapes than any other
tool, except possibly the chisel.
"It is really astonishing, the. kinds of
hammers there are and the manifold
uses to which hammers are put. The
hammer is certainly the most, versatile
of tools. With his hammer alone the
gold and silver smith beats out beauti
ful vases and bowls and the blacksmith

he wills. The smallest and daintiest

3IIMNG OPERATIONS.
: In southern Yuba. along the rich bot
tom lands bordering the Bear River,
are severBl great hop fields, one of
them bein*g-* the, largest in the world.
The season's crop in this product wajs
good, the prices remunerative and : the
Industry is increasing in average and
importance. : ; One of the' recent " enter
prises, in this particular district,'; which
added to Yuba's assessment roll - last
year, is the operation 'of dredffers on
of business properties and building
operations in general. The plans are
now drawn for a new business block
to be erected on the principal street
at a cost of from $25,000 to $30,000. and
several other substantial buildings arc
also being considered.
Marysville's supremacy among the
cities of this northern section is due
to her advantageous location, at tlie
Junction of the. Yuba and the Feather
rivers. Her direct trade comes not
only from Yuba County, but also from
Sutler, which Is one of the richest agri
cultural and horticultural counties in
the State. .
In addition to this, Marysville Is the
most northern terminal shipping point
in California. Her freight rates are
the same as those enjoyed by Sacra
mento and San Francisco and, taking
advantage of this situation, she has
extended her trade in greater or less
extent to air of the counties north as
far as the '-State line.

Marysville and one in Yuba City Just

during the season, principally peaches
and Bartlett pears. The Sutter Preserv

total pack of over 1,&00,000 cans more,
In October, In response to several
urgent requests from the Federation of
Women's Improvement Clubs of the
Sacramento Valley, a meeting of the
women of our city was held to consider
the proposition of forming such an or
ganization in our midst. This proved* a
popular measure and a Women's Civic
Improvement Club was organized â¢Octo- 1
ber 16, 1903, with seventy.-slx original
charter members.
The charter was left open until No

cers in the following: Vice president.
Mrs. David Powell; secretary, Mrs.
Philip C Knapp; treasurer, Mrs. George
C. Thompson; executive committee â
Mrs. St T. Brittan, Mrs. J. R. Garrets
Mrs. F. W. II. Aaron, Mrs. Cline Bull
and Mrs. S. Lewek. All of these, in
fact the entire organization, are repre
sentative women of the community.
They are # commenclng their work with
enthusiasm and an earnestness of pur
pose that means success. WÂ« have
been cordially supported and encouraged
in our undertaking by the men of our
city, who have done all possible to aid
us and who have privately and in news
paper interviews expressed themselves
as thinking this one of the .most impor
tant and best moves ever made in
Marysville. Our regular meetings are
held in the City Hall on the first Tues
day of each month, the Mayor and
Common Council having placed the
same at our disposal and courteously
ordered it to be prepared for our recep
tion.
FOR CIVIC IMPROVEMENT.
We stand for civic improvement in a
the days, the nights are delightful.
The Feather River is unparalleled for
beauty, especially on a moonlight
night, and is used for boating and
bathing extensively through the sum
mer seasons"
We have and will have more attrac
tive parks,- Ellis Lake will soon be an
ideal boating lake, the boulevard a
beautiful driveway and, last of all, the
water supply, in Marysville is one of the
best in California. There is an infusion
of sulphur, which can be increased or
lessened, at will, in the public supply,
which makes and keeps our people
healthy. Nowhere are more beautiful
complexions noticed among school chil
dren than. are seen here. It Is the pur
pose of our Clvicr Improvement Club to
bring this matter of an unexcelled
water supply into prominence. â¢
OUTLOOK IS PLEASING.
In fact, Marysville, surrounded by a
prosperous farming community and
fruit district; "with its beautiful river,
parks and lake; with, the Buttes, famed
for theii* beauty, breaking in the dis
tance "the monotony of the level; with
its golden oranges In winter, its golden
popples In the early spring and Its mag
nificent roses all the yearâ Marysville,
which has produced men like Stephen
J. Field and ranked in early days third
city in our State, is. indeed, a city to
be proud of. It was named by my
grandfather for a woman, for sweet
and gentle Mary Covillaud, and to-day
the women of Marysville are banded
together, with one common purpose â
the improvement and beautifying of
their "city.
The above sketch, as requested, gives
some outline of how our work haa been
commenced and is progressing. Every
woman feels an enthusiasm, every
woman is taking hold with a will. We
have received congratulatory letters
from the San Francisco Outdoor Art
League and from many of the improve
ment clubs throughout the State. We
feel there is nothing too great for ua to
achieve. Our motto, "Scenes must be
beautiful which, daily viewed, please
dally," tells our object. Time alone can
tell our success. â¢
On the leading' driveway of the town
is Napoleon Square. This,has.only v been
commenced. The committee appointed
to bring this park to completion is
headed by Mrs. F.' B. *Ioors as chair
man, with Mrs. S. Lewek as consult
ing chairman. This is a very active
committee and by summer they will
have made of Napoleon Square a^beau
tiful park. On New Year's eve they
gave for the benefit of their fund an
elaborate ball, which, while it was the
event of the season, netted the ladies
a handsome sum as well. Nineteen
hundred and three was brought to a
close amid merriment and the new
year ushered in with great glee. -.
The third committee on public parks
is the Yuba Square committee, with
Miss Schlmpf as chairman. This Dark
is to be commenced, but with the ef
ficient committee in charge it Is safe
to predict In time a beautiful square.
One of the crying needs of our com
munity is a more perfect system as to
the care of our City Cemetery and the
building of a levee about it. A strong
committee has been given this matter
in charge. Mrs. Dora Coombs is the
chairman, with Mrs. David Powell and
Mra. Cllne Bull as consulting chairmen.
This .committee will agitate and effect
in .time the building of this levee, aa
they will be supported by the ereneral
public in this great .work, universal
sentiment being with them in their
undertaking. They will also endeavor
to place the cemetery on a self-sup
porting'basis, as Is now being done In
so many of the other cities.
In the heart of our citv nestles a
natural lake, fed by living springs. To
improve this lake as : to surroundings
and to build a boulevard around it for
walking and driving is the work of
the Ellis Lake Committee. The chair
man Is Mrs. S. Ewell. with Mrs. F. W.
H. Aaron and Mrs. George C. Thomp
son'-ae consulting chairmen. .This com
mittee, on December.* 10, gave Â«,*< de
lightful entertainment In the Marys
ville Theater, netting a goodly sum,
which will enable them to proceed at
once with work, according to the di
rections of a competent landscape
gardener, and Marysville will shortly
be able to boast of a natural lake
made beautiful bv . artificial means
which many another city would give
thousands to possess.
LOOKING AFTER FENCES.
; The Fence Committee, with Mrs.
Carrie Berg as 'chairman and Mrs. J.
R. Garrett as consulting chairman, is
composed of some of our leading
property owners, who will try to use
persuasive arguments to induce every
one to remove fences from their prem
ises. Nothing so adds to the beauty
o"f a town as the throwing open to full
view beautiful gardens and well-kept
lawns, and this is a feature in which
Marysville excels. It !s hoped, in time,
that all will be brought to help in this
movement, manv having already sig
nified their willingness to assist in
this reform.
Realizing that nothing so enhances
the beauty of the scene in our cllmat*
as shade trees, a ' Treeplantlng Com
mittee has been appointed. The wjfe
of our Mayor, Mrs. 6eorge W. Harney,
has taken the chairmanship, with Mrs.
David Powell as consulting chairman.
This committee will, among the first of
their work, establish an Arbor day in
the latter part of Jantiary for annual
celebration. Every child will be asked
to plant Va tree, the same to be chosen
according. to the advice of competent
authorities on the matter.
T>;One of the most .Important commit
tees, as to the comfort of our citizens,
is the, Streetsprinkllng Committee. Mrs.
Harold Cornforth is the chairman and
Mrs. M. T. : Brittan. the consulting
chairmajj. . This committee will urge
upon the proper authorities the need
of a universal system of streetsprink
llng to. take; the place of the limited
one, as to' district, now in effect.".'"
We feel that the city authorities will
cheerfully, respond to. this demand, as
nothing could so Improve the condition
of our city through the heated term.
With a universal system of sprinkling,
Marysville would prove an attractive
place to summer for there living in
cool climates. Although warm through
broad sense of the word. as to all that
beautifies and improves. While an or
ganization composed of 261 women can
not but have its moral effect for good in
a community, yet we are forcing; no
moral pr social reforms, merely, appeal
ing to our citizens in general . by en
deavoring to* make our city more at
tractive.
Marysville iÂ«i a 1 beautiful city, quaint
and old-fashioned. Situated at the
junction of the Yuba and Feather riv
ers, lying: in that delightful climatic re
gion where the citrus fruits and roses
vie with each other in beauty, she is
possessed of all that goes toward mak
ing an interior town attractive. '
I The committees of our Improvement
Club have been appointed according to
the wants of existing conditions. A
street committee, with Mrs. P. J. Flan
nery as chairman and Mrs. J. R. Gar
rett and Mrs. M. T. Brittan as con
sulting chairmen, have under their
special care the, looking after the con
dition of all streets and alleys, the
urging upon property owners the beau
tifying of their premises, the placing
of signs with the names of streets up
on them wherever such signs are miss
ing, the enforcing of all city ordinances
that pertain directly to streets and
sidewalks, and lastly the attempt to
have erected a crematory for garbage.
This is a powerful committee and one
whose work will be seen in the re
forms effected.
PARKS AND DRIVEWAYS.
We have in Marysrille a number of
public parks, only one of which, known
as Cortez Square, is in an advanced
state of cultivation. This, while very
beautiful, still lacks many things, and
situated as it is in the, very center of
the town, it has 'been placed under the
care of a competent committee, hav
ing Mrs. G. H. Baird as chairman and
Mrs. Philip C. Knapp and Mrs. Clino
Bull as consulting chairmen. One of
the first things this commltte .will do
is to plant bright flowers In profusion,
which will greatly add to the beauty of
the park.

Women of the Civic Organization Enthusiastically Undertake Lar'ge'Work That Has for Joint Purpose Adornment and Utility
Systematically Subdivide the Details of the Task in Hand That Great Success May Be Achieved.
WOMEN IN OFFICIAL POSITION WHO. ABE EAGERLY STRIVING TO PROMOTE THE WELFARE OF THE COMMUNITY IN WHICH tAeY LIVE.
The time is the first week in Janu
ary. A group of merry children clad
in pretty colored ginghams are frolick
ing along the street, their faces beam

and th' ir arms loaded with golden pop
pies. California's beautiful noral em

of the city.
The fctreet along which the children
come is broad, a hundred feet wide
from curb to curb, of hard and smooth
n:acadam; the sidewalks are of stone.
The sun chines brightly, but there is
an invigorating cr:spnÂ»*es in the air. and
the remaining evidences of rain, whicli
fell during 1 the night, still linper on the
emerald leaves of the trees and shrub
bery, the blossoms and the velvety
lawns which adorn the yards of mod
est but well-kept and comfortable
homes.
WEALTH OF VEGETATION.
The flowering pomegranate, thqgsame
that stood beneath the walls of ancient
Babylon; the elm, the locust., fig and
Â¦walnut have lost their verdure, but
there i? a wealth of beauty in the lus
trous foliage of th*Â» linden and the cam

magnolias. The lime a-Â»d the locmat.

.far-off tropic isles, still w.-ar their pe

while the orange and lemon droop their
slender branches with the weight of
ripened globes of golden yellow fruit.
Beneath these trees, in the mottled
shadows, the roses and geraniums

blossoms to the J!|;ht and the dainty

stor- of climate and soil the simple pic
ture tells. No wonder the people of
this favored land dwell in anticipation
of a grrat awakening near at hand and
th<- promise of a future almost beyond
belief.
Out in the level open country are
miles of mellow fields carpeted with a
many- of growing grain, telling of the
harvest that i* to come. To the west.
and marking a sinuous line from south
to north; where they gently dip into
the valley, are low rolling foothills.
ppars'Iy peopled now and but little cul

smooth brown sides, vineyards and or
chards, whose products wilj rival those
of Southern France and- Italy. Al
ready the promise is at hand, for here
and there some horticultural pioneer,
bold in experiment, has led the way
with his patch of vines and garden of
fruit trees. It is a small beginning, but
the evidences are there for those who
are yet to come, to see. to learn, to
prosper.
Still to the west and but a few hours'
ride by Ftage or horseback, the tall
Fierras begin to rise above the foot
hills. Here are the placers and the
<i!cpinjrs made famous in the early days
of sold, the great hydraulic mines still
rich with treasure, and the timbered
range where the horses, sheep and cat
tle roam through Fining; and summer.
No region in the world can equal
the great Sacramento Valley in diver
sity of soil, of climate and of prod

counties of this wonderful section,

ing arr.org the pin<^s less than twenty
mil^s away.
MAKYSVILLK PROSPEROUS.
BXaiyarfHe, the county seat of Yuba,
has nevr before felt the same quick
ening si'irit v that has been apparent
during the r>ast twelve months. JCever
has she bc^n more generally prosper
ous, and never has *>he stood on the
threshold of a new year when the fu
ture seemed so bright for the achieve
ment of great purposes. The confi
dence of her citizens was - shown
when, in June last, they voted $64,000
for the construction of a modern sani
tary system of sewÂ«*rage.
This work has now been under way
for several months and will be com
pleted before the opening of summer.
Many other plans for improving and
beautifying the citv have been formu
lated, and the preliminary steps taken
by the Women's Civic Improvement
<"lub, an organization started in Octo
ber and now having nearly 300 mem
bers. These ladies are genuinely Inter
ested in the projects In which they are
engaged and, as they have a good
foundation to start with, their ac
complishments will be correspondingly
greater.
Marysville is one of the best de
signed cities in the State. Her prin
cipal streets are all eighty feet in
width, three of them are 100 feet wide,
and running north and south between
each block are smaller streets twenty
feet ir. width. The streets in the busi
ness part of the' city are of asphaltum,
and one street for two blocks, where
the heaviest traffic comes, is laid in
basalt rock. Macadam and crushed
rock are used on the streets in the resi
dence districts. ; V
One of the most important improve
ments to be effected during the com
ing year is the building of a boulevard
around Ellis Lake, which is practically
in the heart of the city, and which
covers en area of fifty acres.
A driveway will be constructed, bor
dered by palms and ornamental trees;
boats and water fowl will be placed
on \hf lako. and an effect secured
Fuch as but few cities the size of
MaryBVille can boast. In addition to
this resort. MarysviHe has ten blocks
re*Â«ervf<i j n different parts of the eity
for public purposes. One of these,
t'ortez Square, lyinsr in the center oi
tha residence district, is; already im
proved with lawn, flowers, tropical
plants, tree."", iron benches, a fountain
and a music rtand. where band con
certs are given once' a week during
the summer months. Itvis the purpose
of the ladies of the club to at once
proceed w Â» ln tne improvement of two
more of the blocks mentioned, one in
the western part of th#'dty\and the
other in the eastern section. 'All this
sounds ambitious for a place> of Â£500
inhabitants, ard at the same time in
dicates a condition of prosperity that
is unmistakable.
BUSINESS KXTERPRISES.
The same feeling of enterprise ex
ists among: the merchants of the city,
and is evidenced in the improvement
The Chico Enterprise In a special edi
tion groups the significant facts con
cerning the advancement of Chico.
"Two years ago." says the Enterprise,
"Chico stood in careless repose with
two straggling suburbs, the one in tnÂ«
south and the other in the north. To
day the city is full to overflowing, and
no less than six hustling suburbs are
stretching out Into the rich orchard and
farming dtstricts.
"Two years 'ago there were vacant
lots calling for buyers or inviting
houses throushout the residence por
tion. To-day there is not a lot to be
had within the city limits proper, while
but very few are without completed or
partially completed buildings upon
them.
"Two years ago there were the usual
number of vacant houses throughout
the city. To-day we have many fami
lies living In tents because no houses
or rooms are available. Twb years ago
not more than a half dozen new homes
were being built at one time. To-day
over 200 homes and other buildings are
going up within the city and suburbs.
'"Business blocks had vacant depart
ments then. Not a single business house
has a vacant room to-day, while . by
building and remodeling many new
stores have been provided, and new
brick blocks are in contemplation for
1904.
"Two years ago the Chico School Dis
trict had three school buildings. To
day there are five and yet not room
enough for the pupils.
"Two years ago the Chico postofflce
had just been made the center of twen
ty-flve miles of rural delivery. To-day
there are fifty miles. The postmaster
and 'one assistant and one rural deliv
ery carrier attended to the business of
the office. To-day there Is a force of
eleven employed, including four who
have charge of free delivery throughout
the city.
"Two years ago ten cars of freight
sent fro"m the Chico depot in one day
meant good business. This year over
fifty loaded cars have gone out in one
day."
To this pleasing review , of progress
in Chico the Enterprise adds facts that
are given in condensed form to fit the
space available. ' Chico has two sub
stantial banks. Thousands of tons of
fruit and almonds are handled every
year in the packing houses, cannery
and drying yards in Chico. One of the
bept flour mills in the State is in thÂ«
city. The Sierra Lumber Jompany has
10,000,000 feet of lumber awaiting the
operation of the new plant to be soon
completed. This, concern will employ
about 100 men regularly In turning loga
into lumber. Barber, a factory town,
a southern suburb of Chico. la already
laid out. The Djamond Match Com
pany Is putting In a great plant at Bar
ber. In which " fully 1500 men will be
employed. The State Forestry Station
is about one mile from the city. A
Government experimental seed farm
will be established about three miles
distant. The franchise for an electric
street railway has been granted by the
City Trustees. This line will connect
with Barber on the south and Chico
Vecino on thf* north.
According to the Los Gatos Mail, the
electric road between San Jose, Sara
toga and Los Gatos will be ready tf> op
erate as 6Â©on as the poles can be set
and the wires strung.
The Dunsmtiir News reports that the
citizens Of Dunsmuir have decided that
they will have a State bank. At a
meeting 40 per cent of the stock was
taken.
The San Diego Union reports $hat the
San Diego Fruit Exchange will pack
fruit at San Diego for the county. The
fruit will be shipped to San Diego from
Lemon Grove, La 'Mesa, El Cajon and
Chula Vista.
The RIarysville Appeal says that
George Thresher and Charles Llttle
john find the orchardists f a vorable to
the proposed Irrigation ditch of the
Butte County Canal Company.
According to the Los Angeles Times.
Ventura County has produced more
than 1600 tons of waTnuts during 1903,
which are worth something like $240
per ton.
According to the Fresno Republican
there were shipped from Fresno last
year 2000 carloads of seeded raisins.
The Stockton Independent says that
the almonds produced in San Joaquin
County ecual three times the prpduct
of the United States outside of Cali
fornia.

that .the last year has been the most
prosperous Plbmas County has had in

SALT LAKE, Jan. 10. â The phe
nomenon of a midwinter, thunder
storm, accompanied by heavy snow,
was experienced in Salt Lake to-night.
Vivid flashes of lightning were accom
panied by heavy thunder, continuing
for nearly half an hour. A gale which
came with the thunderstorm at times
reached a velocity of over thirty miles
an hour and was accompanied by
heavy snow and hail, which was
driven In blinding sheets, making it
almost impossible to remain out of
doors.
STORM FREAKS
IN MIDWINTER
.. , Lewis, j, who had been in 'the \ employ
of jthe'jflrm for about two months, on
being arrested admitted his % guilt. He
is married and resides with his family
at 129 Fair Oaks street.
Members of the firm of Sevmour &
Elliot were informed by - one of their
clerks that two 1 loads of lumber valued
at SSO had left- the yard, at 142 Towns

out any ; registration being made In
the proper, books. The matter^was re
ported to Captain Martin and it was
soon; ascertained that the piles of lum
ber on Eighteenth street were the dame
that had been taken from Seymour &
Elliot's. â¢Â¦Â¦â¢"--.â¢.. â¢â¢ Â¦ Â¦ â¢
The two loads were duly delivered at
the address 'given and Lewis took the
precaution of placing a red lantern at
night 011-the piles to avold-danger of
collision with passing vehicles. Â¦ The
patrolman on the beat' was speculating
as to' the probable; owner of the lum
ber and being "under . the . impression
that everything was not right, reported
the matter to his superiors. \ A watch
was set on the house, but no attempt
was made on the part of Lewis to dis

Siskiyou, a greyhound of considerable
class owned by H. J. McCarthy,
dropped dead on the field in the decid
ing course of the open stake yesterday
at Ingleside Coursing Park. The hound
had done some sensational running,
though when he reached the deciding
gourse he had not been coursed hard
enough to hurt him under ordinary
conditions. Siskiyou's actions, however,
and his untimely death strengthened
the opinion that some powerful stimu
lant had been administered to him. It
is expected the matter will be invests
gated by the California Coursing Com
mittee, when ao attempt will be made
to fix the responsibility.
In the deciding course Siskiyou was
a strong favorite at 1 to 4 against
Frisky Barbara. After leading his op
ponent- Siskiyou rolled up a score of
nine points before showing any harm
ful effects of "careless handling." Then
he faltered, gradually stopped and" sud
denly "dropped dead. Fast Full , Moon.
Ragged Actor and' Young Fearless were
defeated by him, all at good prices.
.Outside- of this unpleasant incident
the stake was a good one and resulted
in many interesting trials. Frisky Bar
bara worked her way to the final after
some good running.

J. \V. Holmes, Out on Parole From San

City or Met Foul Play.
Friends of J. W. Holmes, a Sacra
mento man, now out on parole from the
State penitentiary at San Quentin, re
ported* him as missing at the Morgue
last night. Holmes left Sacramento a
few days ago and has been here on
business. The authorities think that he
is merely visiting some of his friends
and will turn up all right.
Holmes was convicted of administer
ing knockout drops to a man in his sa
loon at Sacramento about seven years
ago and was sentenced to fifteen years
at Fan Quentin. A short time ago he
was paroled. He left Sacramento a few
days ago to purchase some theatrical
goods here before entering the show
business in the capital city. He had
not been seen for a couple of days, so
his friends, thinking that he had left
the city or had met with foul play, re
ported the matter to tho authorities.

The riflemen had a bad day for shoot
ing yesterday at Shell Mound ;Park.
During most of the time the dim light
prevented the marksmen from accu
rately gauging the center, and made it
hard to get a good shot when it wa"s
niost needed. The organizations which
sent men to the range were the San
Francisco Schuetzen Verein. Golden
Gate Rifle and Pistol Club. Germanla
Schuetzen Club, Norddtutscher Shoot-
Ing Company and the Independent
Kiries. . r""SJ 'Â»"/
" F. P. Schuster did great work In the
competition shoot of the San Francisco
Schuetzen Verein. Notwithstanding the
poor light on the targets he succeeded
in rolling up the good score of 446 rings
in his twenty-shot string. R. Stettin
was high man in the first class with
418, while GeoTge H. Bahis led his class
with 408 to his credit.
In the. Germania Club Frank E. Ma
son was far ahead of all his classmates
with a sct)re of -'27 rings his ten-shot
record. Ho also won a wager by mak
ing thirty-three three-inch bullseyes
In 100 shots, which is considered fine
marksmanship.
Considerable anxiety Is manifest
among the members of the National
Guard of California In reference to fu
ture target practice. 'As all the guards
men are armed with the Kras-Jorjren
sen.rifle it, will be impossible for them
to practice on the ranges on account of
the danger attending; the use of the
new arm, because of its high power.
Expert riflemen differ in their opinion
as to the use of the new gun on the
ranges. Some contend that with a re
duced charge of powder and the use
of a hard leaden bullet there would
be no danger In irhe use of the Krag-
Jorgensen, while others* hold that if a
careless rifleman would load with the
regulation cartridge there would be ex
treme danger both to the target mark
ers and others that might be in the line
of fire. It is generally conceded that
hereafter the guardsmen will be com
pelled to practice on the Government
ranges if they wish to become proficient
In the use of the service arm.
. Jacob Myer, the champion rifle shot
of Sacramento, and one of the best
marksmen in the State, was at the
park and entered enthusiastically into
the â¢ competition Of the Germanla
Schiietzen Club. He reports that rifle
matters In the Capital City have been
stimulated greatly by the successful
shoot given by the Helvetia-Sacramen
to Rifle Club, and at the next festival
event there will be a large attendance
from Sacra'mento.

brothers and other crack poloists of the
East. It was intimated by them that
such an invitation would meet With a
favorable response. The Eastern riders
could hunt two days a week, or, if they
preferred polo, they could play every
day in the week.
Peter D. Martin is expected to ar
rive from New York to-day. He will
probably figure in future polo games.
F. J. Mackey, the veteran who played
such a brilliant game last season, is at
Riverside. He will come north shortly.
Tom Driscoll played a brilliant game
on his pony Little Jack Horner In the
third period. Twice he ran the ball
nearly the length of the field, his op
ponents being unable to take the ball
from him. Once he saved a goal by a
clever play. Ezra of the Reds scored
the last goal in this period.
In the fourth peric-d Tom Driscoll
ran the ball across the field but Cyril
Tobin pre\*ented a score. Near the end
of this period Driscoll's pony stumbled
to his knees and sent him out over his
head on the soft ground. H(Â» was unin
jured and joined In the laugh at the
figure he cut. Had the pony not stum
bled at this critical moment a go-al
would have been scored.
The sun was shining. when the game
commenced but a light rain set in after
the' first period and^bontinued through
out the afternoon. The field was heavy
and the ball did not roll well.
Tom Driscoll -then scored for the
Whites, running the ball from the cen
ter of the field. He was Quickly fol
lowed by Joe Tobln who scored for the
Reds. Jiftt at the end of the period
Ezra was struck on the shoulder by
the ball. He recovered quickly and was
able to continue.
Neither side scored in the first period.
Near the end of the period the Reds
were given the ball on an offside play.
To prevent a goal- the Whites drove
outside for a safety. This gave the
Reds a free stroke from the 35-yard
line at the opening of the second period.
Ezra sent the ball toward the goal but
it did not go through until auite a
scrimmage had ensued.
The score does not indicate the ag
pressive same played by the losers.
They had the ball around their oppon
ents' goal on numerous occasions but
seemed unable to send it between. the
posts. '
The rain did not discourage the Bur
lingame polo players yesterday, a spirit
ed j?ame being played on the private
field of Francis J. Carolan. The Reds
were victorious by a score of three
goals to one. The teams lined up: ,'"

Internal Injuries, wounds on the scalp
and a dent In his skull. - He was picked

Emergency Hospital, where his wounds
were dressed. L.ater he was taken to

As soon as the excitement of the ac
cident was over the captain sent for
the tugs Sea King and Sea Fox, which
made fast to the ship's stern and start
ed to move, her over to the opposite
shore. The crew, which was largely
under the Influence of red vintage,
apparently did not appreciate the
transfer across the bay, and when the
lines were about to be cast off as many
of them as could commenced to clam
ber over the ship's side and scramble
onto the dock.
Finally, when all lines were cast off
except the port bowline, two of the sail
ors slid down this to the wharf. A
strong ebb tide was "running at the
time and was rapidly sweeping the ves
sel down onto the British ship Eden
more, lying at the opposite berth. Pilot
Rasmussen. who was at the stern,
shouted out in thunderous tones and In
plain English the order to hold the
bowline fast, but when the order was
translated into French and shouted out
from the bow It resulted In the men on
shore letting go the line, and the vessel,
despite the efforts of the ' two tugs,
drifted down onto the Edenmore. After
a tremendous jabbering In French, In
which all hands on board took an ac
tive part, assisted by their companions
on shore, the line was again secured to
the dock, the ship pulled clear from the
Edenmore without damage to either
vessel and was backed out into the
stream amid great Jeering from the
members of the crew who had Jumped
ashore.

Yesterday Captain Dalrgnon de

for the chance of base. Sailor Joseph
David with others of the crew was
sent aloft to the main topsail yard,

dates for the next convention are: El

coded that in case the convention fails
to pro to Denver permanently the fight
will lie between El Paso and San Jose.
Tne only fear that Denver will not win
is based on the possible efforts that
the Tcxans will make to gain their
cause. They are coming In strong

5 ' â¢ The original of that Sunday's Art Supplement^ is
p the first artistic reproduction showing the architec- =
H ' tural- beauty of tlie Ivorj- City, and Is selected as one
B . - of the best of the many views submitted, it being the jfj
H object to combine in a limited scries the most import- 8J
ant and interesting features of tlie St. Louis World's H
m FaIr - g
? - , The Palace of Machinery, representing power, g
13 â¢ force, in reality the pivot on which this immense ex- B
E* \ hibition revolves, is tlie inaugural issue of what -will H
2 . â¢ doubtless prove the most interesting scries that was pj
q ever .givrn free by a publication. H
tj . The main entrance to this building shows a triple B
]t arcade, with large pavilion in the center. The north B
g ' . front, which is thirteen hundred feet in length, has an j|
g : . arcade of nine arches as a center feature. S
H Following the classical in architectural effect, Q
Oj . there are found several beautiful examples of the Ital- B
\\ . ' ian and Spanish RenaLssance styles. The brilliancy of B
color, tlie realisUc scene, with the moving crowds of â¢*
n sightseers, give variety and anlniation to the picture. gj
f"; Nothing is so universally attractive as power. Men, B
>{ animals and nature are most fascinated when, by B
p, i*s exercise, tliey demonstrate possession of extraor-
Â§. duiary power. AdminiUon for might and the desire |!
q to see it in evidence, to feel it and sense it, to remem-
B bcr it and to tell of it, are instinctive factors with Q
B men, women and children. This is the keynote to the H
g * collection and arrangement of tbe exhibits ln the Ma- B
t% rhlnery Department â Power. Hrre are shown the H
\* Â¦ methods and means for creating every variety of ma- A
12 chincry for the generation, transmission and use of y
Q power. B
Forty tliousand horses harnessed together and H
Â£j pullmg wltli one mighty concentrated effort convey S
2 the Idea of the total power which makes the wheels
B of this World's Fair go round. The engines, con- Â£j
B densers, pumps, moving mnclilnery and accc&sorles B
"â¢ makine up the potver plant, which is the lamest ever B
ti Â«.!inwn at an exhibit, are installed on the main floor B

j, Hoyt's ever popular "A Trip to

,la,ct evening, and served to keep a big
fATidienee In a constant state of
I hilarity.
The comedy does not fseem to stale
?with ai?e; In fact, it Is like irine, and
improves as the years roll alone. After
the mass of absurdity that was played
at the California last week Hov+'s play
monies with refreshing T-,]eite Uret and its

The company that presented the

John B. Jessup, who played the ro*le
â¢ As dramatic craftsmanship "Ghosts"
represents possibly Ibsen's highest
level. His five characters upon whom
rests the exposition of the whole awful
etory are burned out with a clutching
realism. The horrific situations arise
from the mad conjunction of the un
happy creatures of his thoughts as in
evitably as death from lif.e. and the
vrhole is Welded together with a colos
sal Fkill. Weak noints are there, some
possibly a matter of locale â as "when
Parson Manders insists that the new
orphanage built by Mrs. Alving shall
remain uninsured, as injuring evi
dences a lack of faith in Providence.
Again, where the unhappy Oswald is
heard in the'very words of his degener
ate father, making love to the servant
Regina. the long arm of coincidence is
stretched. But in the course of the
play these things are forgotten. Its
cumulative horrors fall like blows upon
the sense, its crowning terror, where
the unhappy madman shrieks for the
sun. a thing: too painful to be borne.
It is just as well as it is. Majrnifl
feent as a piece of dramaturgy, com
ipelling as to Us lesson, the drama is
*too painful. From the spectral horrors
fhÂ« evokes, Ibsen allows us no moment
â¢of escape. Like some unspeakable
wizard he looses ghost on ghost until
:"th<? air is a-murk with th<*m. and their
'gray, chill robes brush one's very
â¢Â«heek. One looks at one's neighbor and
wonders: "Is it thus you are. whom I
think 1 know? Whom do I know?
"Sot you â nor myself?" And therein
lies madness.
Almost unheralded, quite unknown,
a remarkably good little company
.-walked Into town last night â¢with the
first local production of Ibsen's
'"Ghosts" â and walked out again. One
wonders what would have happened if
they had stayed. Save . the upper
boxes there wasn't a seat left in the
Columbia, where the play was given.
It was a first night house except as to
its gowning, with a heavy sprinkling
of the weird folk only weird plays like

The plans of the exposition manage
ment contemplate the installation of
complete municipal exhibits, represent
ing about twenty of the largest Ameri
can cities. Each of the cities. Including
t?an Francisco, . is invited to erect a
building. The exposition management
has built and equipped a "model street"
at a cost of $50,000. This street is 1200
feet long and is immediately in front of
the main entrance. It is four city blocks
long, with a public square in the center
and buildings along either side.
A considerable number of these build
ings are already located. Close to either
end of the street are two restaurants,
to be conducted on high-class lines. The
hospital, day nursery, the model library
building, thg model school to be erected
by the Missouri -commission, the work
insmen's model houses to be erected by
the National Cash Register Company,
the model railroad station furnished by
the city of Atlanta, the New Orleans
nee kitchen and the museum all hold
places on this street. Philadelphia will
erect a model filtration plant.
Congress wiB appropriate funds to
errct a building planned by the .Com
missioners of the District of Columbia.
New York City has appropriated $25,000,
and in other cities appropriation bills
are now pending. Boston -will erect a
model park shelter. Among other cities
represented will be Kansas City, St.
Paul. Buffalo, Minneapolis and Pitts
burg.
The pavings and equipments of the
model street will be worked out accord
ing to the most aporoved methods. An
exhaustive exhibit of street fixtures,
lamp posts, drinking fountains, kiosks,
fire plugs, etc., and a septic tank in
This is the first time in the munici
pal history of international expositions
that the special features of municipal
exhibits has been undertaken. The
rapid advancement of American cities
has led the exposition authorities to
illustrate the methods which have made
this development possible in a manner
that will elicit the admiration of mil
lions of visitors at the World's Expo
sition this year.
MUNICIPAL EXHIBITS.
California secured more space in this
mammoth structure than was given to
any other State, but California is so
large and its resources so varied that
36,000 feet of floor space is far from
being enough. The special San Fran
cisco exhibit would be thus limited to
floor ppace about 40x20 feet.
Notable among these, Los Angeles
has already secured $33,000 and will
make a brave effort to convince all vis
itors to the fair that she is the coming
metropolis of the Pacific Coast. Los
Angeles has grown and thrived by rea
son of the advertising done by her pub*
lie spirited citizens. It has well paid
thorn. These county exhibits "will be
displayed- in the Agricultural building.
Only $130,000 was appropriated by the
State Legislature for the purpose of
representing the entire State' of Cali
fornia with all its varied industries.
Heavy inroads upon this sum will be
made in paying for erection of a State
building, , expenses of commission and
transportation of heavy exhibits to and
from St. Louis, and although the State
Commission Is willing to do everything
in its power for this ctty. it will be im
possible to col'eot and install a satis
factory exhibit without working an in
justice to other sections of the State.
Many of the counties have appointed
local committees and raised by special
taxation and subscription large sums
of money, to be used in supplementing
the work of the State Commission.
Until recently It was feared that this
city's representation would depend en
tirely upon the efforts of the State
Commission. r â¢ . i
If the public at large will assist finan
cially In carrying out the well formed
plans of the* local committee on display
at St. Louis, San Francisco will have
one of the most unique anfl practical
exhibits.at the World's Fair.
All the gentlemen serving on
these committees are not only well
known for their integrity and good
judgment, but are men of wide experi
ence in this particular work which as
sures a" most satisfactory outcome of
the project in hand. They give their
services gratis, and will endeavor to
make an enviable record in this line of
work. They are acting in perfect har
mony with the State Commission, which
is anxious to see a San Francisco build
ing erected.
Much, of course depends upon the
willingness of the city's merchants,
professional men and representatives of
other lines of business. The raising of i
$50,000 for ' any object is no easy task j
a'nd in this instance must be consum
mated quickly. The enthusiasm shown
by the 400 members of the Merchants'
Association at its annual banquet, at
which time the San exhibit,
at St. Louis was the sole topic of dis
cussion, is a safe Index of public senti
ment. The Executive Committee In so
liciting: subscriptions will make the can
vass by industries and each Interest
has been apportioned a certain per cent
of the $50,000 needed. Individual firms
of each group will be asked to contri
bute pro rata, according to their com
mercial rating. Apportionment made
by the committee is based on clearing
house methods and is absolutely fair to
all concerned. The subscription books, j
records of exhibits collected and plans!
carried out will -be . cpe.n to Inspection
at all times at the headquarters jof the
committee, room 20S Parrott building.
All the city's various interests Rhould
unite In a concerted effort to make this
a success. No question of party poli
tics, religion or faction, enters here.
The benefit to San Francisco will bo
incalculable and the city should not be
backward nor sparing In- providing the
necessary funds.
The organization of .committees to,
carry out this work was effected Joint
ly by the five leading commercial or
ganizations of the cityâ the Merchants'
Association, the Merchants' Exchange,
Manufacturers':, and Producers' .Asso
ciation, Board of Trade of San Fran
cisco and Chamber- of. Commerce. Ten
members selected from each organiza
tion constitute a, general committee of
fifty, from which committee an execu
tive committee was chosen, consisting
of E. B. Pond, H. U. Brandensteln, C.;
S. Laumelster, Irving. F. Mhulton- and
Joseph Sloss. .The committee on dis
play includes James p. Phelan (chair
man). T. C. Judkins, E. O. McCormick..
W. H. Mills and F. J. Symmes. F. H.
Colburn was constituted assistant sec
retary and manager.
EXPERIENCED MEN.
. It Is hoped that the local committee
on display will decide to Curnish the in
terior of the San Francisco Building in
mission 'style. This is the only one of
the great cities included In the model
street that was was ever a mission,
and \ the heavy plain surfaces of that
style will show our beautiful woods and
marbles to perfection. The fine leathers
produced here can also beÂ» utilized In
the upholstery and hangings. Music,'
art and literature of local production
will .here find suitatle surroundings 1
and excellent opportunity for. display.
AJ1 commercial interests will be pro
moted to the fullest extent.
dences anfl public buildings, are excel
lent subjects for photographs, and the
atmosphere and sunshine make the
conditions ideal for the camera. An
unanswerable sunshine argument will
be made with a fine set of enlarged'col
ored photographs of the market stalls
at Christmas time. A comprehensive
photographic exhibit of the newsboys
and flower venders in midwinter with
varieties and prices of flowers grown
in open air will be shown.. Also motion
pictures of the Olympic Club swimming
in the surf at Cliff House beach on
Christmas day. as well as views taken
in Golden Gate Park. Including- the
music stand, children's playground,
etc.,- taken at the same season, will be
shown. The official Weather Bureau
records will form a part of this ex
hibit.
It is ( probable that the San Francisco
building will be modeled after the Fer
ry building, which is well known to
the world as a great water depot. The
dome of the new City Hall has been
suggested, but many magnificent domes
are already erected on the fair grounds.
A structure after the style of the Ferry
building can be easily divided into de
partments and well lighted.
The bay of San Francisco is often
likened to the heart and lungs of the
city and its fine commercial advantages
will not be lost sight of. The commit
tee on display has planned to have a
relief map 12x8 feet, which will show
the contour and elevation of land sur
rounding, the bay from Benecia to San
Jose. A hemisphere eight feet in diam
eter at the equatorial line will serve
,to illustrate San Francisco's unequaled
shipping facilities. These will be sup
plemented by a set of enlarged Dano
ramic views of the entire bay and mo
tion pictures of the entire water front
showing the shipping coming and going
and with special reference to the ferry
system. These will , be ., enforced bv
charts, maps and models of the street
railway lines, also water, light and tel
ephone service, street paving and sewer
system.
In the municipal exhibit proper will
be found the fire, police, health and all
administrative departments, including
parks.' museums, schools, charities,
churches, clubs, baths, social settle
ments and corrections. .
It has long been a problem with ex
position managers how to make the
civil activities an attractive feature.
The average State commission confines
its efforts to manufactures and raw
products. Municipal and civic progress
has been confined to statistics princi
pally, but the new order at St. Louis
makes it possible to illustrate lectures
with colored slides and motion pictures
in addition to the. regulation printed
statistics and illustrated literature usu
ally distributed.
San Francisco can make a brave
showing in a photographic way. , The
hills and bay, with the beautiful resi-
PLAX OF BUILDING.
There are many sound reasons for
and none against the erection of a spe
cial, building. It is doubtful whether a
majority of visitors' at the Wqrld's Fair
will closely inspect the Agricultural
building, which is situated on an ele
vation over a mile from /the main en
trance. Thousands of persons may re
main only a few days, and their pro
gress w'ill be arrested by the exhibits
nearest at hand. Then, too, the depart
ment of municipalities is the most nat
ural place to look for a city exhibit. It
is an undeniable fact that a collective
exhibit representing this city's interests
will make a finer showing under one
roof than if segregated in various de
partments. The city has been accorded
one of the finest sites on the, model
street, and will gain a distinct prestige
from the fact that it will be the only
city west of Denver invited to erect a
building.
Seattle, Portland and Ixis Aneeles
are keen on the point of competing for
Oriental trade and expansion for Pa
cific coast manufactures and industries
of all kinds, and San Francisco cannot
afford to stay o.ut of the race. If this
community fails to utilize this oppor
tunity for its fullest worth, the visitors
at St. Louis will go away with the in
evitable conclusion that Los Aneeles is
the leading city of California. A. city,
like a business, requires advertising in
this strenuous age,\and it is not likely
that this generation will ever have an
other such chance to make a distinctive
and Characteristic bid for public favor.
In a recent letter Charles M. Reeves,
secretary of the commission on legisla
tion, St. Louis, says: "The site of the
model city is perfect. It lies directly In
front of the main entrance to the expo
sition, and I believe will attract more
attention than any other feature of the
fair." -

the street and in the park adjoining the
town hall and church. .
