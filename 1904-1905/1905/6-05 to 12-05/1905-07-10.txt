ST. PETERSBURG, July 10.â -A divpatch from Tlieodosla states that, dur-
InK a parade of the -Volua Rcsrin'ient, a nhot wa< fired' from the ranks at the
colonel, but missed him. The i*liottras a slsmal for an outbreak, rrhleu was
quelled ctter an officer cad a private bad been severely wounded. The trouble
evidently Ti-aÂ» a roflci of the mutiny on the Kniaz Potemkine. '.
KUSTENJI, - oumaoia. July 9.âAd
miral Kruger tiiis afternoon boarded
and took possession of the Russian bat
tleship Kniaz Poterokine, King Cliarles
of Roumania having sent instructions
to the commander of the" Roumanian'
EQuadron that the vessel be delivered
to the i^uEsian auuiorities.
The torpedo boat' which accompanied
the Kniaz Potemi.me, however, left for
Odessa without surrendering, declaring
that she had not mutinied, but that tlie
Kniaz Potemkine had forced her to fol
low. - . Â«
Ivniger arrived with his
squadron this morning, and after ex
canging the customary salutes Inti
mated that he had come to arrange for
the transfer of the Kniaz Potemkine.
Admiral Moslinsky, commander of the
Roumanian squadron, boarded the Rus
sian uatleship , Tchesme and informed
Admiral Kruger that King Charles bad
ordered him to turn Uie vessel over to
the Russian admiral. The formalities
of the transfer were completed this
afternoon and Admiral Kruger boarded
the Kniaz Potemkine.
Despite the efforts of the Rouman
ians to get things in sh.p shape, every
thing aboard the battleship was still
in a state of wild. disorder. The offi
cers' cabins were stripped of every
thing of any ' value and bloodstains
\u25a0were everywhere. There was sufficient
ammunition aboard the Kniaz Potem
kine to have enabled the mutineers to
make a desperate resistance-
It is 6a.id that during the last few
days the vessel was navigated by .two
engineers and an officer, with revolvers
at their heads. All of the sailors
wished to surrender, with the excep
tion of Matuschenko, the leaderof the
mutiny, who resisted for some time
and wanted to blow up the ship.
Seven officers were prisoners aboard
the Kniaz Potemkine, They were in a
pitiable condition from ill-treatment.
They declare that Matuschenko himself
killed ten officers of the . battleship."
All of the papers and books belong
ing to the vessel were destroyed.
It apears that the decision to surren
der the Kniaz Potemkine , was made
vhen it became evident; that no other
vessels would Join In the; mutiny.*- The
crew of the battleship seemed to.be un
aware of the surrender of the ;Georgl
Pooiedonosetz and expected that!* she
also was cominpr to Hasten ji to,capitu
late to Roumania.
Twenty married sailors - from - the
Kniaz Potemkine have' applied' to'.' the
Russian Consul here to be sent back to
Russia. .

the. Kniaz Potemkine surrendered to ' the
\u25a0Russian squadron,' alleging that they had
acted under compulsion;
The coal supply of the mutinous battle
ship was nearly exhausted, but there was
-ample food on board. -
A Russian priest, after the transfer/
held * a service of purification on board
ti*e Kniaz Potemkine, sprinkling the ves
sel and her flags with holy water, i .
. Admiral Kruger.'s- squadron, .which
brought a crew for the Kniaz Potemkine,

ST. PETiixtSBURG. July 10.âThe,Gov
ernment â¢is -awaiting a report from Ad-^
miral Kruger before making representa
tions to the Roumanian Government for
the return of the mutineers of the Kniaz
Potemkine. It was stated at' the Foreign
Office yesterday that no official'informa
tion of the attitude of 'Roumania' toward
the mutineers had been received. .

St. Louis Financial Con
cern Charged With

Government Will Aid in Pro

000 Stockholders.
WASHINGTON. July 9.â Postmaster
General Cortelyou to-night announced
the Issuance of a' fraud order agJlTrt the
People"s United States Bank of St. Loula.
Mo., its officers and agents, and E. C.
Lewis, effective on July 9. The action bars
the company from the use of the mails,
after an- investigation by the postal
authorities as to the details of the busi
ness of the institution. The Postmaster
General, â¢in hia anouncement to-night,
says: <\u0084 : : .-
"It is understood that the funds of the
bank which have not been borrowed by
Mr. Lewis and his enterprises, amounting
to about two-thirds of tne total amount;
remitted, are deposited in banks and will
be available toward reimbursement of
the stockholders, who number upward of
65,000. It is the. Intention of the officers
of the Postofflce Department to co-oper
ate with the Secretary of State of Mis
souri In every proper way for the inter
.ests;.of; tbe>. Investors and depositors."
DISCIPLE OP/FREXZIED FIXAXCE.
ii Tbe \u25a0 announcement of Mr. . Cortelyou
says , that, although in i early "articles -to
his magazine. Lewis , represented that he
would .subscribe^ to ".the "capital -stock- a
dollar for. every dollar, subscribed by all
others, so * that' he -would own one- half
of : the ; capital - stock,- and that later he
represented that he had pledged his-en
tire* fortune, every dollar he had. and hi 3
publishing business in this banking enter
prise and that his subscriptions would,
exceed $1,000,000, the inspectors found that
Lewis had not co-operated to the ex
tent of a single dollar of his own money,
although the bank had been "In operation
several - months and had a paid up capi
tal stock of $2,000,000. Continuing, \u25a0 the
statement says: -
"The inspectors found that Mr. Lewis
had made an admission to that effect to
the bank examiners^ on April 3, 1305. The
inspectors and their office force in St.
'Louis made a careful checking of the sub
scription books, finding that on March 13.
1905, Mr.: Lewis had received and held as
payment for shares of stock In the bank
{2.259.044 and ' had accounted to the bank
In an amount not exceeding â¢ $2,204,999.
This showed that every, cent of the $2,000.
000 capital stock wh*ch had been paid. ln
was " paid out of subscription money re
ceived by Mr. Lewis from the public and
that none of his own money had been In
vested in the enterprise. . This was found
to be the fact, although Mr. Lewis had
stated in writing to the Inspectors that
$495,750 of the' ssoo,ooo paid in at the or
iginal incorporation of the bank were his
personal funds.
NOT A DOLLABOPIT IS HIS OWX.
"Subsequently, at the hearing before
the ' Assistant Attorney General, Mr.
Lewis admitted that that money was re
ceived by him from the people and was
not his own. Although asked to do so
at the hearing. Mr. ' Lewis failed .to pro
duce any evidence whatever that any of
his personal funds had gone Into this
enterprise. Mr. Lewis stated at â¢' the*
meeting that the directors had never re
fused to make a loan he requested. .
'The most important of the representa
tions were that all of the runds, i of this
bank would -Jbe loaned by a committee
composed of three directors each from
the five principal banks of St. Louis.
"The evidence ' showed, and Mr. Lewis
admitted it, . that hundreds of thousands
of dollars we*e loaned to himself and
his various enterprises; that no commit
tee" of fifteen had been established, but
that the loans had been made practically
at - Mr. Lewis' wiIL~
"On March 15, the day after the Inspec
tors began their Investigation In the bank,
Mr/ Lewis placed^in its assets two notes,
one for $50,000. signed by himself alone,
without '; collateral, .the other for $146,376,
signed by the board of - directors. , Mr.
Lewis received no money from the bank
at that* time, the notes being put Into
the bank. to cover money previously ex
pended by Mr. Lewis. The last mentioned
note. -Mr. . Lewis claimed, covered money\
spent In : promotion of_the Â©ani.;but as

the disastrous effect of recent strikes

"The failure of the strike on ' the

says tne department, "resulted in the

that of the glaziers was followed by
the dissolution of a union of 500 men;
while the disputes among the Ful

caused very large losses. In some in
dustries trade has only recently re
covered from the recent depression,
which greatly weakened the work
men's organizations.
"Between October 1, 1904. and April
1. 1905. 16Â» organizations in this State
dissolved and twenty more amalga
mated with other unions of the same

China's Request to Be Eepre
| sented {. During' tfie: Peace
Â¥ ;Meets _With
Japan's^ ; If irm Objection
WASHINGTON. - July 3.â China's re
quest to be represented in the Wash
ington conference, .on the ground that
she is vitally interested in its proceedings,
has been received by 1 ; the President and
informally transmitted to the belligerents."
Whether the President has received the
formal replies cannot be learned, but it
can be stated that, while Russia is in
clined to favor the suggestion, Japan will
not consent to it.
: ., Japan has already made public her as
surance that Manchuria is to be restored
to .China. r^That is one of " the principles
for; which, she says, she has been fight
ing. Japan regards herself as fully
capable of the execution of that promise
without the assistance of China, and, In
view of China's inability, before the war
to cope, with Russia' in Manchuria, the
Japanese Government is unable to 6ee of
what possible I service a Chinese repre
sentative would be .in the Washington
conference. . Moreover, the Japanese"' have
all ; along taken the position that when
peace ..'negotiations j were oegun they
would be conducted directly, with Russia.
It Is altogether unlikely that the Wash
ington Government will press the claim
of .China, and the official view here does
not sympathize with the Idea.
? Tho past week has seen few develop
ments in the plans for the negotiations.
Negotiations for an armistice are not ex
pected to be concluded until after the
plenipotentiaries meet It Is pointed out
again that the beginning of the rainy
season In the war zone removes the ne
cessity for the immediate signing of an
armistice. Little doubt is felt, however,
that this will be the first subject dis
cussed by the plenipotentiaries, and prob
ably; their. Initial act will be the signing
of a protocol providing for the cessation
of, hostilities for a limited period.
Baron de Rosen will go to-New York
within- the next few days and thence to
Oyster. Bay, to be presented to the Presi
dent. Meantime he Is In daily conference
with the attaches of the embassy and has

the ring, says it will certainly be a great
fight. Ryan is of a stocky build, with
broad shoulders, and a couple of inches
shorter in stature than Peterson. One
thing in particular that will meet with

SKIN OF NEGRO
TURNING WHITE
Freak of Nature in Colusa
Causes Amazement Among
Doctors Who Hear of Case
SAY DEATH WILL ENSUE
Specialists Claim Changes
â¢ When Completed May Have
Fatal Eesult for Porter
Special - Dispatch to Th* Call.
COLUSA. July 9.â The latest freak of
nature and marvel to the medical scien
tists is the change of color which is
gradually; creeping over the body of a
huge negro porter in Colusa. Mutation
began several years ago. The spots of
white have spread to the face and handa.
Although the victim of this strange dis
ease suffers no ill effects at. present, ha
has been advised that as soon aa the
complete change takes place death will
ensue. . At present he is employed at
hard labor and enjoys life, but Is tha
object of much curiosity.
In 1901 Charles Hugo, Bell, porter of the
Colusa County Bank, was afflicted with
serious throat trouble, which necessitated
the removal of tha thyroto 'gland. After
the thyroid gland was removed slight in
convenience was caused to tha porter, but
no sickness resulted. A short time after
he had left medical care, however, a
series of white spots showed on the palms
of his hands. Blotches of blood gathered
under his finger nails and his feet turned
a lighter color.
In a few weeks the spots grew in siza
and number until they began to attract
the attention of people witn whom ha
came in daily contact.
The attending physician claims that tho
change of color ia due to serious nervous
trouble and sure death awaits Bell when
the transition 13 completed. This does not
seem to worry BelL
i Great blotches of black skin are grow
ing pale on his back, the change being
quickest on the groins and around tha
elbows and knees. His hands could not
be told from a Caucasian's were not the
remainder of his body seen at the same
time. Spreading spots of white are start
ing to grow upon his face and the eyes
are surrounded with rims of white. The
end lof hi 3 nose presents a queer con
trast to his. cheeks, which so far have
been unaffected. White skin is plainly
seen when he removes his hat.
Charles Hugo Bell was born in Co
lumbia, Ga., in 1563, but has made Colusa
his home for the last sixteen yearsl Hla
parents were full-blooded negroes and
came direct from Africa as slaves to the
United States.
A CROCODU.K SUPEnSTITTOX.

â¢.A curious cote upon this superstition
appears In the monthly report of TV. B.
Smith, district officer at Timbang Batu,
North Borneo. He says: . \u25a0
"Two crocodile fatalities have been
reported and there have been several
narrow escapes. Toward the end of
December the enlightened authorities
at Pangkalan Banlau sent up ah aged
Chtnaman to Timbang Batu under ar
rest for. having washed his- mosquito
net in the river. A woman was taken
in the same place by a crocodile a tew

enhanced his 'guilt,' while adding. I am

Murket for Tree Stumps.
A new industry in the region at the
head of the lakes is the gathering of tha
tree stumps .\u25a0 for use in the Maine ship
yards. A large number of wooden shlp9
are built every year, and It has been
found that the most efficient corner
braces are those made, from ineso
stumps, and hundreds are shipped East
every day. . The roots of the trees and a
short section of the stump are used in
making the braces, and .stumps from,
trees about a foot In diameter are found
to be the best. The stump is taken from
the ground and roughly hewn into shape
before being shipped. After Its receipt
at the. shipyards it is made into a perfect
brace. The cost of a carload "of tho
stumps Is close to $400 and the freight
charges run over JICO a car.â Milwaukee

C. N. HUBBARD FOUND DE^D
Friends Believe He
Took Overdose
. i nil. , 1
by Mistake.
Father Is a Banker
at Houston,
1 exas.
Claude N. Hubbard, eon of a rich
banker In Houston, Tex., and foreman
of the Oakland office for the Pacific Re
fining and Rooting Company, was found
dead in a room of the Gage apartment
house, 42S Geary street, in this city, yes
terday morning. Some think his death
was Intentional, but the people who had
teen and talked with him the night be
fcre are convinced that he took an over
dose of poison by mistake.
Miss Amanda Hanford, daughter of the
landlady, who Is Mrs. E. V, Ratto, re
ceived a telegram from Hubbard Satur
day saying. "Don't go out th^ evening. I
will be over." He arrived at the Gage
at 7:30 o'clock. He was under the In
fluence of liquor and remained in the par
lor chatting with Ratto, Miss Han
ford and Samuel Miller. He sent Miller
for a bottle of wine, but only took a small
glassful, the others finishing the bottle.
About 12:30 he went to the room that
had been prepared for him. .<
Before he left the parlor Miss Hanford
noticed a bottle f in his pocket labeled
"Papine," which is composed chiefly of
opium. She asked him what he used it
tor and he replied: "I use It to quiet my
nerves after drinking absinthe." She ex
pressed her surprise that he would drink
absinthe, and he said, "I meant wine."
He showed her the bottle, a half pint,
and In the printed directions pasted on
it the dose for an adult was Indicated as
a teaspoonful. She asked him to be care
ful not to take more than the proper
dese and be replied, "You know me; I'll
be careful."
About 10 o'clock yesterday morning
Mrs. Ratto tried the door to the room in
which Hubbard had retired and was sur
prised to find It open and him lying on
the bed with his street clothes on. She
called her daughter and. together with
Miller, they went into the bed chamber.
Miss Hanford called for him to get up
and receiving no answer sfle shook him,
only to find that he had expired. The
bottle of "Papine" was empty and there
was evidence that he had poured the con
tents into a tumbler and swallowed the
draught. There was an odor of carbolic
ncid in the glass and it is thought he
may have used the "Papine" to deaden
the pain.
Hubbard started to drink Thursday and
was acting so queerly Friday that the
stenographer in the Oakland office sug
gested to him that he go to bed. Miro
L. Applegate, foreman of the business,
became anxious for HuDbard's safety
Saturday and watched him closely.
Manager Apniegate was first aware of
the absence of Hubbard rrom his duties
when a suit of clothes which had been
worn by the deceased was delivered at
the office. Immediately ne set out to
locate him, being unable to do so, but
found that he had bought a new suit. He
then supposed that Hubbard had gone
to Texas.
Hubbard was not a dissipated man and
no reason Is given for his rash act. He
had been with the refining company but
six weeks and In that time had won their
entire confidence.
"I had only known him for a short
time," Miss Hanford said yesterday,
"and this was his second visit to
the house. If he had not been
a man of good habits and evi
dently ashamed of his cortdition when he
came here Saturday evening we would
have thrown him out, but as it was I
pitied the poor fellow and begged mamma
to give him a room, so that he would not
become more intoxicated.
"There is absolutely no truth in the
statement that I was engaged to him,"
she declared, "and I don't ihink that I
would have pone to see his body "if the
circumstances had occurred in another
place. My God! What will his unfor
tunate mother think if she hears that
people said he committed suicide over a
girl? I swear that our relations to
gether were nothing more than passing
good friends."
Dr. Bacigalupi made an autopsy on the
body at the Morgue and sent the stomach
to the City Chemist for analysis.
Hubbard was 24 years of age and un
married.

BOULDER CREEK, July 9.â Mrs.
Charles Gray, better known as a spy
of the Confederacy, Is dead, after a life
full of exciting experiences. While
returning from a day's outing In Boul
der Creek to her home in Sunnyside
this noted woman was drowned in
Boulder Creek.
She and her her husband were
driving a young colt, that had never
seen an auto before. On a bridge a
quarter of a mile above Boulder Creek
the animal became frightened at an
automobile and backed off the bridge
down a steep bank and into the creek,
a distance of thirty feet Mrs. Gray's
husband leaped to the bridge and es
caped without Injury, but Mrs. Gray
fell beneath the buggy and was
drowned before she could be released.
Strange to relate, the horse escaped
with only minor injuries.
In the auto were Colonel J. C. Mc-
Mullen, a rich banker of Oakland, and
his wife, Mrs. Frost of Oakland and the
two Miss Taylors, ol Alamcda. Paul
McMullen, 6on of Colonel
drove the machine. The desperate at
tempts on the part of the occupants of
the auto to ajye the life of Mrs. Gray
were unavailing. Colonel McMullen
and his son risked their lives in their
endeavors to reach hen sliding down
a sheer precipice for thirty feet, and
swimming a long distance. They were
the first to reach her, but they ar
rived too late.
The Coroner's jury rendered a ver
dict completely exonerating the auto
party from blame and commending
them for the prompt assistance they
rendered. The jury scored the county
authorities for permitting the bridge
to remain in such an unprotected con
dition, and urgently recommended > the
immediate placing of guard rails along
all unprotected bridges and bluffs.
Some fifteen years ago Mrs. Gray
was prominently mentioned in connec
tion wtth.:the Walker murder on -Ben
Lomond' Mountain, for which â¢ George
Bullock Is now serving: a term In San
Quentln. She was 65 years old. Her
husband Is 33. They were married only
a year ajro. .
Telegraphic advices from Boulder
Creek state taat Mrs. Gray was better
known as Pauline Cushman. The cor
respondent Is In error, as Pauline
Cushman, the noted Northern spy, was
buried in this city by Lincoln Post.

the others Involved In the scandal with
him will escape criminal prosecution.
Officials of the Department of Justice
are of the oDlnion that he President will
order a criminal prosecution of Holmes
and the cotton brokers t who purchased
advance information, notwithstanding the
opinion of the United States District At
torney's office here that a criminal prose
cution would not lie.
The President Is expected to order a
more thorough Investigation of the scan
dal in the ' Agricultural j Department, as
there is a strong conviction among repre
senatlves of the Cotton Growers' Associa
tion and legal officers of the Government
that the evil has - not been corrected.
The District Attorney, on being j asked
to give an opinion as' to whether a prose
cution â¢ could j be brought and carried
through successfully, replied that, on the
papers submitted, this could not be done,
but the District Attorney was not sup
plied with all the evidence and the papers
handed to him were in his possession
only an - hour. With all j the evidence be
fore him and more time -to* consider it, 1t
is believed that another decision would
be reached.
CHIEF HYDE IS UNDER FIRE. \u25a0
, Government officials who have inquired
Into' the case say it is incredible that
John Hyde, the chief statistician, â¢ could
have 'been ignorant "of ' what was going
on in , his ' own bureau: '. He ! is criticized
for spending so much* time In . Europe.
:\u25a0[ If â¢ Secretary Wilson does not order ; a
more searching , investigation %an appeal
will be made to the President by Rich
ard Cheatham, secretary, of the Cotton
Growers' Association, who made the orig
inal charges against Holmes.' Cheatham
Is after the scalp of Statistician Hyde.
He> left for Atlanta to-day to confer
with officers of the association.he,repre
sents, :with a view to taking furuier ac
tion. He will recommend that President
Roosevelt be requested to direct that an
other investigation be held, as he is. con
vinced that a wholesale barter of Gov
ernment information could : not -be car
ried on without the knowledge of others
inside the department.
Secretary Wilson is criticized for hav
ing made all the facts hi the case public,
thus making It possible,\t Is pointed out,
for those Involved to cover their tracks
and hide important evidence. -
. It is learned that Holmes cannot be
prosecuted for either., larceny or embez
zlement, but, possibly, he could be prose
cuted for bribery. . It is suggested that
Holmes, Van Riper, Peckham and Haas
could be prosecuted for having,: conspired
to making false reports. . In altering the
figures, Holmes made himself liable to
prosecution for conspiracy.

Theodore H. Price of New \ York- ar
rived In Washington to-day^ and,
through his attorney, requested Secretary
Wilson to withdraw "what' Price charac

ELKS DESCEND
UPON BUFFALO
Thousands of Delegates of
the Order Gather for the
Nineteenth Annual Session
PLAN WITH CANADIANS
Arrangement Proposed That
Will Put Dominion Branch
Upon a Brotherly Basis
BUFFALO. N. V., July 9.â Thousands of
delegates to the nineteenth annual re
union of the Benevolent and Protective
Order of Elks arrived here to-day and
were; given a hearty welcome as they
marched through the gayly decorated
streets. Every delegation was met- by a
section of the reception committee and
a bard and escorted to their quarters.
The Automobile Club of Buffalo enter
tained the Grand Lodge members to-day
and gave them a delightful ride through
the city's parks and avenues and along
the Niagara frontier.
With the arrival of prominent members
of the order many booms have been
launched for the honor of entertaining
the Elks in 1906. Ex-Grand .' Exalted
Ruler O'Brien and Grand Exalted Ruler
Fanning have returned from Toronto,
where they went to consult over the
proposition to admit Canadian Elks to so
clnl Intimacy with the parent order In the
United States.
"We have formulated a report," said
O'Brien, "which will be submitted jto the
committee on the good of the order. The
plan does not favor absolute affiliation,
but places the two orders on a brotherly
basis. It provides for social intimacy be
tween members of the two orders, the
visiting of each other's clubrooms and
participation In entertainments. Elks on
both sides of the border can have the
privileges of sociability, but may not be
present at any meeting where secret work
Is transacted. .This Is as far as we can
go. To provide for affiliation would be
to change the constitution of both or
ders, and this Is not feasible even if de
sirable." ' â¢ V,:. *
The committee will probably submit the
report to the delegates for their action
this week.
"TRAIL" OBSEEVES .
SUNDAY-CLOSING LAW
Concessionaires Keep Side
Shows Closed Despite
Their Threats.
PORTLAND. July 9.â The "Trail" con
cessionaries did not attempt to open their
attractions to-day as they stated yester
day, was their intention. The Lewis and
Clark exposition authorities absolutely
refused to recede frjm their position and
even went so far as to order its guards
to close by force If necessary any attrac
tion that attempted to violate its con
tract.
At the last moment the concessionaries
appointed a committee to hold a confer
ence with the exposition authorities dur
ing, the coming week. The exposition
management, it is understood, is unable
to accede to the request even if it so de
sired owing to its having entered Into
contracts with the Ministerial Associa
tion, which secured many prominent di
vines to deliver Sunday speeches In the
auditorium, and- who it Is stated will re
fuse to carry out their agreements if the
"Trail" attractions are allowed to remain
open.

FASCINATING.
Professor Dixon's Lecture Course Is Very
Popular [ With the Students.
I LECTURER WHOSE COURSE OX
POETRY OF SCOTLAND DRAWS
THRONGS OF- STUDENTS.
BERKELEY. July 9.â An interesting
contrast in the field of learning is afford
ed the tuzemer school students in Dr.
Ludwig Boltzmann. the eminent Austrian
physicist, and Professor James Main
Dixon, the Scotch lecturer. Dr. Boltz
mann, heavy, bewhiEkered, most pro
found, attracts those who desire . instruc
tion along the higher avenueE in the
field of physics. He comes from the land
where flows the "beautiful blue Danube.'^
On the contrary is Professor Dixon, a
slight, wiry, Scotch scnoiar, born and
bred on the banks of the river Doon, of
which Robert Burns sang.
To Professor DSxon's lecture room
come throngs who listen eagerly to the
Scotchman with his delightful rolling
"r'B" and a fund of information about
Scotch literature that for depth and
breadth is remarkable. The poetry of
Burns is Professor Dixon's subject, and
daily, to a crowd of fascinated school
raa'arcs and others, he discusses "Bob
ble" Burns' verses and Scotch poetryâ
the poetry of the lowlandsâ in general.
He gives particular attention to the eth
ical and intellectual characteristics of
the lyric poetry* of Scotland and the
structure and pronunciation of the Ayr
shire and other lowland dialects.
Professor, Dixon, who graduated at St.
Andrews' T^mversity. in Edinburgh, and
was an assistant in the philosophy de
partment there, has had a career as an
instructor in universities the world over.
He was professor of ' English literature in
the Imperial University of/Tokio before
ccming to America, and has decorations
bestowed upon him by the Japanese Em
peror for his services at the Imperial
University.
Dr. Dixon is renowned among scholars
for his researches in the field where po
etry is measured to ascertain the effect
of the heart beats upon the meter of
verses. His unique experiments in this
field have been In progress in Professor
Howison's department at the State Uni
versity for Bix months. He has worked
with Professor Dunlop and F. 'S.
Wrinch in these experiments, using ma
chinery especially constructed for the
purpose. The result of this work is to be
embodied in a volume by Professor
Dixon next year.
The Scotch tongue and the Scotch peo
ple naturaly appeal strongly to Mr.
Dixon, and it is because of this that he
is now giving his spare * hours, day and
night, to promoting the -"Scottish day"
programme in the Greek Theater at. the
university, on July 15. He ' is secretary
of the executive committee in charge of
the programme.

S MALL RETURNS
FOR HIS LABORS
Williahi Malter Exerts Great
Effort to Swindle a Few
People Out of Petty Sums
HIS LIMIT IS ONLY $1:50
Suave Young Man Pretends
to Own Property and
Makes Trifling Borrows
OAKLAND, July 9.â With an imaginary
$35,000. realized from the sale of a phan
tom ranch at Bakersfield, .William Malter,
23 years old, suave, sleek and glib, swung
Into town last week, ready to meet enter
prising traders in city -and county prop
erty, who might be willing to part, with
their holdings for coin of the realm.
William worked a. scheme for Winning
easy money, but the mystery of his oper
ations lies in the fact , that the . returns
from his deals were entirely out of har
mony with the mental labor he e^grted to
accomplish his ends. And besides he has
landed in jail. -' "â¢-.
Malter was caught yesterday in East
Oakland, where, as William Bohle, he at
tempted to make small loans.' on /the
strength of projected investments in real
estate. But he .was suspected, and the
jM3lice took charge of the. enterprising vis
itor. To-day there wore uncovered nu
merous financial transactions that Malter,
or Bohle, must explain.
He ventured into Captain W. R. Thom
as' office, a. few days ago, dropped a re
mark or two about the sale of his Bakers
fUld ranch, and hinted that he was about
to become a^ landed proprietor in" Ala
meda Coufity'. Did Captain Thomas have
any "Clients who might desire to sell fine
ranch lands? Most assuredly. Captain
Thomas could accommodate his inquirer.
Thomas F. Fish, who resides at- 5 Me-
Clure street, was introduced to Malter,
and was so taken that he invited the
prospective buyer to be 'his guest for
several days while they looked over Fish's
ranch at Sunol. Malter was wined and
dined on a visit to the property. It
struck his r fancy. The price, 59000, was
right. A bargain was made, and Malter
evtn hired the keeper or the place to re
main. He also arranged to purchase a
bunch of cattle. â¢
Then it was a wait for a day or two
until the bank should transfer the coin
from Bakersfieldâ would Captain. Thomas
let him have ?1 50 over night? Certainly.
That was the last of Malter according to
Thomas' complaint to the police this
morning. - ,
J. P. Hardin of iS27 Encinal avenue,
Alameda, parted with $1 50 while nego
tiating the sale of a house to Malter. H.
L. Kemp, an Eleventh street furniture
dealer, was selected as a victim, but he
was suspicious, and saved his money.
The police were notified by a woman, who
refused to disclose her identity, that Mat
ter had swindled her.
And there are others. \u0084-. â¢ Jfflts^s
Why Malter exercised so much effort, on
such small returns is what puzzles the
victims and the .police. His limit ap
peared to be $1 50. .. -' >;%:'.\u25a0\u25a0 . \u25a0:'. :.'
FLAMES SWEEP
THROUGH HILLS
Mountains South of Liver
more Are Ablaze and Much
Damage May Be the -Result
OAKLAND, July 9.â Twenty-two* square
miles of territory are being swept by a
fire that is : raging in the hills .'south of
Liyermore: H undreds of acres of grazing
land are being devastated and ranches
are being threatened by the flames, hun
dreds of the ranch owners ; are working
to* save their property and check .'the
spread- of the fire. â¢ . "
The blaze started on Crane Ridge, in
tho Mocho Creek region! south of Liver
more., The country, -parched and dry
from the long continued hot weather^
was like tinder, and the fire spread with
wonderful rapidity. -Over' the Crane Ridge
to the east and ; south it spread. .Up
toward Buckeye hunting lodge and over
Into Corral Hollow Creek it worked, its
way. eastward and down Lone .Tree. Can
yon it swep^tr into^San Joaquim, County
"and out toward the San Joaquhj yal!ey\.
Fortunately for the people of ? the" Llver^
more - Valley, ther wind carried it away
from Livermore and into a section that is
not so thickly populated. While the dam
age'being done is great, the, loss of prop
erty would- have been- tremendous had
the fire been carried into the grain fields
and vineyards , of * the \u25a0 Livermore \u25a0 section.
". A campflre left by careless, hunters, la
supposed to have been the cause . of the
conflagration, and the stockmen* who have
had their grazing lands burnt . over j and
who have lost cattle, by, this fire are look
ing for the ones who caused the trouble.
The stockmen of this section have an 'or-'
ganization-that Is -against hunt
ers,; for every year, a fire of this kind is
generally started through criminal care
lessness upon the part of -hunters.- These
fires not only Injure the -feed, but cause
a great loss \to stock, the young; cattle
meeting death in the flames. ' The extent
of- this loss". Is never -definitely^ known,
even, by the owners of the stock; and this
fire,:' covering i'puch j an , area,' is bound' to
be an unusually, damaging one. , >; 1

* Venerable Oakland Homes
Sold During' Week Ended
BUSINESS SATISFACTORY
Heal Estate Men Find the
Market More Active This
..â¢Month Than Was Expected
OAKLAND, July 9.â "Mosswood," the
old Moss home at the corner of Broadway
and Moss" avenue, which for many years
has been one of : the landmarks of North
Oakland, was sold this week by Attor
ney Edward C: Harrison, who' is settling
up the estate 'for the heirs, and the prop
erty will probably be cut up into building
lots as soon as ' the sale 13 approved by
the Probate Court. The name of the pur
chaser of the property has not been made
public as yet and will not 'be until the
sale is approved by the court.
The property consists of 11.59 acres, and
in the State proceedings it was appraised
at $J5,0U0. When' the old home was of
fered for sale a number of'bida were re
ceived, the largest being $50,005. and as
this is more than $5000 above the - ap
praised value of the property thure is no
doubt that, the, sale will receive the ap
proval of the court. This sale was by
far the largest of the last week.
Two other old Oakland homes have
also changed hands in the last week, the
first being the Chapman place at the cor
ner of Third avenue and East Fourteenth
street, which was sold by J.'-H. .Mac
donald & Co. to John Le Blanc. The new
owner, hasl , already begun the work of
tearing down the house, built more. than
thirty, years ago by General Hardenberg,
to make room - for several new houses,
which will be erected at once..,, . ..

GIRL'S JEWELS
ARE RETURNED
Mystery Deepens 'I- in Affair
of Valuables Stolen From
M iss Eowe at
POLICE ARE PUZZLED
Father Insists Upon Eegard
ing the Case Closed, Now
That Daughter Has Gems
BERKELEY, July P.â Th% mystery^^ sur
rounding the j disappearance of diamonds
and 'other t jewelry valued at $2000 from
the home of Hejiry liowe on University
terrace 'was. deepened to-day by the an
nouncement of Mr. Rowe that the jewelry
had all been returned. Instead of sim
plifying the case, however, this announce
ment from the contractor added to the
strange features of a puzzling case. The
Town Marshal's office confesses itself at
sea.
It is. now hinted that the Rowes sus
pected some friend of Miss"; Geraldine
Rowe, who .is said to have worn the
jewels when they were stolen or'lorft,
and it was^because of r a desire to exurt
pressure; upon .the suspected friend or in
timate of the family that so much secrecy
v/as observed in the matter from .ths be
ginning. \u25a0 , From chance words dropped by
the Rowes in ;their conversations regard
ing the -robbery, it is. believed that a
kleptomaniac friend took the jewels from
the girl or secured the:n from the Rowe
house, after observing them 1 on' Miss
Howe's person. Those who. hold 'this
theory declare it is plausibre when taken
in connection with the attempt made to
hush the matter up. first in the Marshals
office, then in the Rowe household' and
now by the announcement of Mr. Rowe
that the jewels have been returned, _lhat
they are safely un4e r lock and key -and
that "there is nothing more to be said
about the case.'-
Yesterday Henry I. owe Informed Deputy
Moran, through J. , T. Farrar, that Jew
elry aggregating in value nearly $2000
had been stolen from the Rowi3 mansion
on University terrace. To-day he. denies
that he put any such value upon the ar
ticles, that they were worth at the most
â¢â¢only a few hundred dollars. 'â¢
To the ; Marshal's representatives Mr.
Rowe' said his theory of the robbery was
that; thieves in San Francisco had seen
his 1 daughter wear the je.vels, had fol
lowed her. to the house .on University
terrace, learned ttf^t her'home was there
and later had made the haul.
To-day Mr. Rowe denied that he ever
entertained s eh a notion or held such
a theory or had communicated such" ah
idea to the Marshal's office. The theory
in question was expressed by Mr.. Rowe
to Deputy.-. Farrar. When told to-day
that Rowe had repudiated the statement,
Farrar expressed amazement and then
declined to discuss the matter further.
Despite the fact that Rowe says the
jewels have been returned to his home, no
notification to this effect had been sent, to
the j Marshal's \ office by Rowe, and the
Marshal's men are still busily at work
on the mysterious. case. The police in San
Francisco have be.en given a list of .the
jewels and- supposedly have searched' the
pawnshops in the city for them,. not hav
ing been informed as yet. that whoever
removed the jewels' from Miss Rowe's
person, or from the Rowe house.v has re
turned them. . , . .
\u2666 : When Rowe was interviewed about the
robbery yesterday he evaded questions
and said he might be able to "clear 11
all up by Tuesday." To-day he believe*
he has cleared it up, twenty-four hours
after the original notification to the po
lice of the robbery, with his announce;
ment of the return of the valuables.
According to the information given the
police the Jewelry stolen included a gold
wedding ring, a gentleman's scarfpin, a
number of diamond rings, 'a brooch, a
necklace and minor articles. The jewelry
represented by this data was estimated
to be worth $1635.
Miss .Geraldine Rowe is now at Lark

Eev. Potter Tells Congrega
tion of Experience While
Wiping Locomotives.
OAKLAND, July 9.â After spending
two nights In the shops of the West Oak
land railroad yards, wiping engines and
doing the work of a common laborer that
he might learn from experience what the
life " of the railroad man is, the Rev.
Dwight E. Potter, pastor of the Union-
Etreet Presbyterian Church, to-night
greeted the members of his congregation
again and told them of hl3 experiences
while engaged In -"breaking in" at the
shops. * -
That great interest has been aroused
by. the fact that Rei. Mr. Potter has en
deavored to gain a knowledge of the life
of -the-.workingman by. experience, was
manifested by the fact that a large part
of the congregation : was composed of the
men. with whom the pastor has worked
as a comrade for the Mast two days, all
being eager to hear him tell of his work
In the shops. \u25a0 , -
In the course of his address the Rev.
Mr. Potter said:
In my work In ' the railroad Â«hops I \u25a0 have
learned mSny things which are new to me.
and which I think will \u25a0be new to you. I
have learned that over, each of these shops
hovers an unseen ideal â a perfect model, ana
that } the constant endeavor of the men em
ployed In the different branches cf ths work.
Is to as nearly as possible, approach this
ideal in their work- ,
When I reported. for work on the flrÂ»t t night.
I was set at the task of wiping engines, under
the direction of â¢a . man who did, not know
that I was other than what I seemed, an
ordinary "new hand," and I was treated ex
actly as any other man would be treated la
the same position. I w-as told what to do and
the boss raw that I did as I was told. And
I found out Ix-fcre long- that the first thing to
learn In railroading Is to obey orders.
Later I was directed to help onÂ« of the
machinists In repairing engine So. 110Â©. and
in this work ' I car Vied one end of a heavy
treakbeam. Â«n<l I tell you that tt was so hÂ«avy
that It taxed my strength, and made mÂ« think
tha* I was not . as g.>od a railroad man as
I had thought- I then crawled \u25a0 Into the pit.
beneath th? locomotive and helped to set the
beam in place, my part of th<Â» work belr?
to drive in the pin which held the bolt of
the connecting rod. XoW this may Â«em un
important, but it was" not so. for "bai this
pin chanced to have come out, the bolt might
have falien out. and this would ha\-e al
lowed the rÂ»i to drop, and If this should hap
pen at a critical time, the engineer would be
unable to stop his engine.
And Just as the little things of a locomo
tive are important. Â»o are the Htle things of
cur lives. We" should .strive Ilk? the ma
chinist, to follow as nearly as possible the
perfect model given us by God. the Lord
JÂ«~uÂ«< Chri't. " " â¢ .
I have found that for every piece of wcrk
done ' In th<s railroad shops there Is a pattern
which originates In the brain oi some man
who' has In his - mind the great unseen. Ideal
of a ' perfect loc/>motlv> or Â«ir. and that the
constant ..endeav/tr of the workman Is to ap
proach as nearly as posÂ«ible to. this Ideal.
You ptobably do not know, and I am sure
that I did not until I went to -work In the
shops, that all/ of the depots erected on the
Southern Pacifle system are built In the Oak
land shops. This, however, is a fact, and I
found' that before a. stroke of work is done
on the construction of these, blue prints of each
part of the work must be prepared. . and it
is from these that - thÂ» .work la \u25a0 done..- and
the" designer of : these dep<jt3 has â¢ In.- hla mind
an ideal of a .perfect depot, although in : this,
as ;In . everything else in â¢ the . present condi
tion of the .world, perfection is Impossible.
I also learned . that when the cars come Into
the yard 3 thpy are not allowed to go out again
until they have been Inspected and if the
slightest thing is found to be wrong, a shop
tag is, placed on them and no trainman dares
to move them until they have been repaired.
How many of uÂ«i are there who are sadly in
need "of shop tags, that we- may come to Go*Ts
repair^ shop, -the church for correction of our
spiritual faults and Imperfection*. \u0084 -'--"Â«;
The perfect church Is the jrreat\unseen "Ideal
of God. \u25a0" and he desires that men shall shape
th'elrllves like that nf our Lord J*sus Christ,
who Is the pattern of the perfect man. ~
When any part of a car or a locomotive be
comes " unfit for; further service, it Is thrown
on the ecrap pile and this to me brings the
thought of the 'many men whÂ» \u25a0by their own
acts, their ' own . disregard of the teachings of
God.- are turning their, faces to the scrap pile
of : humanity. " .The scrap pile is the grave
yard, and to me the most pathetic point In 4 all
railroad yard? \u25a0 tnd \u25a0 the sleht of the us*Â»eÂ«s
material, once brieht and glittering, now aban
doned -to rust and decay, brings the thought
of the/hundred* of men who by < dissipation
and >\u25a0 sin are fitting -their, bodies for the scrap
plleof the flesh.â¢ and their souls for hell, tho
scrap pile of the.souL"*?^Â£JsÃf^'>s
-T Let us, then, before it -is too late. . heed thÂ©
shop tag of ; the . : great * Inspector, and come
into Â« the church, the repair Â«hop of ;Ood that
he may . shape our- lives after . the pattern he
has drawn for man. our savior. Jesus Christ

Miles Medical Co., Elkhart, IndNOME SENDS HER RECORD
SHIPMENT OF GOLD DUST
Bullion Valued at
$1,500,000 on
Zealandia.
Vessel Arrives at
Seattle Three
Days Late.
Bringing $1,500,000 in gold dust, the
largest shipment ever received from
the extreme northern El Dorado, the
steamship Zelandia. Captain Gilroy, ar
rived in Seattle from Nome yesterday
morning. She brought eighty-five first
clats passengers and a full complement
of steerage. The Zelaudia is owned
by the Barneson & Hibbard Company
of this city, and was the rirst boat to
sai! from San Francisco for the north

through her perilous position, and suc
ceeded In reachJng Nome. Here the
damage was temporarily repaired.
Some uneasiness had been felt about
her in shipping circles, as she had been
due at Seattle for three days. It was
thought that possibly the repairs made
at Nome, with the limited facilities,
might not have been sufficient to put
her in condition to make the return
trip. It was a storm at Nome that de
layed her.
Captain Gilboy reported on June 28
there were in Dort at Nome the steam
ers Lyra. Tampico and Elihu Thomp
son, the schooners Snow and Burges
and Alice McDonald, the bark Dashing:
Wave an<i the United States revenue

rival at Nome of the whaler William
Bayles, with five whales and 10,000
pounds of bones; the whaler Janett,
four whales and 6500 pounds of bone,
and the whaler Narwhal, one whale
and 2600 rounds of bone.
He also reports that at Solomon Bay
were the steamers Edith and Olympia,
and at St. Michaels the whaler Belve
dere with her machinery disabled.

PRINTERS ARE
HOLDING OUT
Committees Claim Situation
to Be 3lost Satisfactory
and Look for Settlement
HOLD A BIG. -MEETING:
Union's Resources Make the
Problem of Caring for the
Idle Men an Easy One
Yesterday afternoon the printers
who were locked out of nine-hour of
fices gathered in force at 22 O'Farrell
street. The committee looking after
the Typographical Union's Interests re
ported at length, and the situation was
declared to be most satisfactory. The
union offices are adding men to their
forces and the nine-hour shops are un
able to transact business, it was de
clared. Assistance of a financial na
ture has been offered from the unions
affiliated with the labor movement of
San Francisco, but resources of those
connected with the printing industry
were said to be sufficient. It was re
ported that the Typothetae .was adver
tising in every direction for help and
that tho results so far have not proved
satisfactory. â¢
The union decided to increase the
benefits paid by the International Ty
pographical Union to the locked-out
men. Single men will receive $7 a
week and married men $10 a week,
lieneflts will be paid on Monday after
noons, between 2 and 4 p. m.,at 533
Kearny street.
The whole controversy was reviewed
by speakers. |lt was argued that will
ing men can produce better results in
eight hours than unwilling help in a
longer workday. So many employing
printers, it was asserted, have ex
pressed entire satisfaction with union
conditions, realizing fully that It is to
their best interests to. have a fair scale
covering hours and wages on which
to estimate for work, that the trade or
ganizations believe the outcome is not
in doubt.

BATTLE IN THE WATER
Crazy Tailor Succeeds in
Ending Days After Desper
ate Struggle With Friend
SACRAMENTO,. July 9.â Edward Lotz,
a tailor from San Francisco, who has
been held at j the , County Jail In an ap
parently demented condition for the past
few v days, committed suicide, this morn
ing; by throwing himself into the China
Slough. â¢ o*,*rÂ«v:
Lotz was being taken to the 8:20 train
by Deputy Sheriff Edward Reese and S.
Berowitz, a friend of Lotz * from' San
Prancisco. When they reached-the banks
of the China Slough, j Lotz broke away
from Reese and " Berowitz and ; plunged
into the slough. The water was not deep
at the place Lotz picked out. to end his
existence and he walked out into the
water about. fifty feet before he reached
water over his head.
Lotz was closely followed 4nto the wa
ter by his friend Berowitz. The latter
grabbed him /and tried to pull him out,
but Lotz got hold of Berowitz's ' legs and
pulled him under. Lotz seemed to be
seized with a lit of - t violence and .grabbed
Berowltz by the head and the two strug
gled desperately in the water."
Finally Berowitz realized that he, too,
would be drowned if he. did not brake
loose from the crazy j man's hold. He
fought and succeeded in freeing himself
and then rose to the \u25a0 surface of the wa
ter and called for help.- He was partially
exhausted and swam to a fence that pro
jects into the slough. He rested himself
on the fence and , called for A
Chinese responded and Berowitz" told him
he would give him $10 if he would save
Lotz, -who was still struggling in the
water. The Chinese was afraid that the
water was too deep and Lotz went down
for the last time. Berowitz then swam
to the shore. - . \u25a0 â¢
Deputy - Sheriff ]Reese v-waded Into . the
slough In an attempt to save the drown
ing'man, but not being an expert swim
mer, was unable to render much as
sistance. .V;
The body . was recovered about 11
o'clock by two fishermen whom Sheriff
.Reese employed to drag the slough.

TRAGEDY ENDS
PLEASURE TRIP
youthful Visitor From lowa
Is Drowned in a Creek a
Few Miles From Woodland
COMPANIONS AEE SAVED
Timely Arrival of Stranger
Prevents the Loss of Three
Swimmers Instead of One
WOODLAND, July 9.â A pleasure ex
cursion to Cache Creek Saturday after
noon ended in a tragedy. -Herman
Neyenesch, a lad of zt> ' . years, was
drowned and John and Marinus Van
Zee narrowly escaped a - similar fate.
The victim, who lived In .Bella," la:,
came to Woodland last week" to visit
relatives. The excursion to , Moore's
dam was one of a series "of outings
planned for his entertainment.'
The three boys went swimming after
luncheon. Xeyenesch, when' asked if
he could swim, replied: "Can I ;swlm?"
and Jumped fronT the boat Into the
deep . water above the dam, intending
to swim to the platform.' His com
panions noticed that ; something was
wrong as soon .as he. reappeared.
"Whether it was. cramps ' will not be
known, as he sank â¢ before they . could
reach him; .both dived tin ..after: him.
It is probable that they, .too. would
have drowned - but' for the timely' ar
rival of a stranger, , who . succeeded in
dragging them . from the ..water more
dead than alive. After several hours'
work the Van Zee boys were restored.
The body of young, Neyenescb. was
recovered from the bottom of the.creek
by a Chinese who. lives near the dam. j

THE TRADE SITUATION.
*T-Â» HERE was not much feature to trade last week. It was Fourth
j of July week, which is always a dull one and in the height of
* the usual summer lull, when many mills of the various manufac
tures close down for inventories, repairs, etc. Still, the showing
was excellent. The bank clearings gained 47.1 per cent over last
year, Cincinnati and Cleveland alone out of the forty-five first cities
and towns on the list showing a loss, and these so small as to; be
almost no loss at all.
The gains of the largest cities were heavy, such as 654 per
cent at New York, 34 at Boston, 23.1 at Philadelphia, 70.4 at New
Orleans, the latter being due to a sharp advance and excited trading
in cotton, 17.6 at San Francisco, 14.3 at Chicago, 21.9 at Pittsburgh
and so on. The aggregate clearings, however, fell off to Â§2,144,
56i,000, against the recent normal of $2,500,000,000. The failures
were away below the average, being 16b, against 206 last year. The
railway earnings continued to exhibit their steady gain, those for
June being 6 per cent over last year, the fiscal year showing an
average of 7 per cent over 1903-04.
Trading in Wall street was heavier last week than during the
preceding week, the daily sales running up to an average of about
1,000,000 shares for the week. The market for both railway and
industrial shares held steady as a rule, some advancing and others
declining, there being no general tendency, either up or down. The
July interest and dividend payments, as already mentioned, ex
ceeded those of July, 1904, by $5,500,000, and it is remarked that
most of this gain was immediately reinvested in . those securities
which returned such satisfactory results during the year. Of this
increase the railways and industrials each contributed about $1,000,
000, railway interest payments about $2,750,000, and industrial in
terest payments about $500,000.
Money continues plentiful and easy at moderate rates of in
terest. A feature ofthe season is the increased independence of the
Western banks in the matter of supplying funds wherewith to move
the crops. Up to the past year or two the New York banks had to
supply all of these funds, which caused a stringency in money, last
ing several months, but the calls upon New York are now lighter,
the Western banks carrying sufficient funds to move their cereal
crops. Still, much of their surplus money is deposited in the New
York banks, and its withdrawal therefore exercises more or less
influence upon the New York money market. ,-~jv^
The expenditures of the Government during the fiscal year just
closed exceeded the income by something under $25,000,000, but
even this is a better showing than that made by the preceding fiscal
year, when the deficit was $45,000,000, though the latter included the
exceptional payment for the Panama canal. The net showing, how
ever, indicates improvement during the fiscal year just closed.
The feature in staples during the past week was the excitement
and advance in cotton, owing to the Government report showing a
crop condition of "jj, or a coming crop of about 10,500,000 bales,
against 13,000,000 for the preceding year. The cereal markets have
been irregular, but devoid of excitement, although there were sharp
fluctuations in wheat at Chicago on several days, owing largely to
fears of black rust in the Northwest. Wool continued very "firm
and in brisk demand all over the country at high prices. Increased
activity in hides was noted, and leather continued firm and in good
demand, with Boston reporting liberal orders for footwear for fu
ture delivery. The Chicago provision market continued quiet and
"without especial feature.
On this coast the weather was the feature. It was the hottest
ever known in July, according to the Weather Bureau, and on Fri
day temperatures ranging from 100 to 115 prevailed throughout the
State, except at San Francisco and Los Angeles, and these two
points were not far behind. Of course such weather as this inter- 1
fered with business more or less. Hay baling, threshing, potato
digging and vegetable gathering were discontinued in many dis
tricts, and a large quantity of fruits and vegetables was spoiled. by
sunburn, while general lassitude and an indisposition to transact
business pervaded mercantile quarters. '
The wheat and barley markets developed great strength and
made material advances, owing to poorer returns from threshers
than expected, which led to a sharp reduction in the estimates of
the volumes of these two important crops. They are not turning
out as well as anticipated before the threshing machines went into
the fields. These threshing returns are wonderful disillusionists
sometimes, and there is no disputing them. Their exhibit is con
clusive and final. Estimates of the barley crop have been cut from
700,000 tons to about 500,000 tons, and most conservative wheat
handlers are now figuring on a crop of only about 400,000 tons, oi
about 30,000 tons more than 1904, which was a very short crop
year. ,If these estimates prove correct it means good prices for
both wheat and barley during the coming year.
Other conditions on the coast, such as the domestic and foreign !
trade, money market, real estate and building operations, etc., con
tinue flattering, and the end of the current prosperity is not yet in
sight. ' -\u25a0â¢;\u25a0; * . : \u25a0'.;\u25a0: ff: \u0084
BENEFICIAL INSTITUTIONS.
IN a study of social "problems developed by the progress of mod
ern industry, Richard T. Ely, professor of political economy in
the University of Wisconsin, bases the chief hope of escape from
evils resultant on rapid advance in productive methods upon an
increase of institutions to meet the new social needs which have
arisen. He believes that a survey of industrial history and present
industrial life shows that it is futile to try to suppress the large or
ganizations of capital and the large organizations of labor.
He points out that there is a certain psychical' type of man
corresponding to every phase of our industrial evolution. . It is only
a part of humanity that is adapted to meet successfully a change of
conditions. Unless special preventive measures be taken a period
of rapid progress leaves behind a relatively larger number of this
class of crowded-out workers. The big problem of our age then
is the creation of institutions which will enable society to deal in
the best way with the different elements in the community as they
are divided by mental and moral characteristics.
The idea of institutions for such purposes is not new, but Ely
shows more clearly than others the value of the extension of the
principle. Civilization must create institutions to serve the needs
of classes of men with widely varied capacities. The professor be
lieves "the movement is destined to continue, as it is~an inevitable
outcome of that mighty struggle for equality of- opportunity, which >
is shaping human history." It is not only for the less capable -that
institutions are desirable. The most gifted and industrious arc
liable to meet with accidents which in a competitive societv will
ruin their fortunes, for there are limitations to what can be accom
plished in insurance by private effort.
The solution has developed further in Germany than elsewhere.
It is said now to be generally acknowledged in that country that
the risks of industry should be borne as part of the cost of pro
duction, and that this must be provided for by general laws. Speak
ing of the need of other institutions, Ely touches on dynamic sociol
ogy when he says "an attempt must not simply be made to meet
the needs of a class of low average mental traits and moral charac
teristic, but also, as far as possible, to raise each class to a higher
level." .
Mint officials expect the new $20 bills to be unusually popular. We can
not see how they can be more popular than the old $20 bill. With most of
us a bill's^popularity depends upon its denomination. â Washington Post.

which, so far as known^ is hot fol

country. She is* desk sergeant on the po
lice force in that; city, says the Phila

Miss Payne does not wear a uniform,
nor does she smoke nor swear " while on
dutyâ or off it, for that matter. Indeed,
since her tenure of office began '"No

spicuous places on the walls of the po

weed by visitors is strictly tabooed.
For several- hours each night Miss
Payne is in entire charge of ; the force.
Seated at a desk In headquarters from 7

Formerly Miss Payne was a seamstress,
employed at a garment factory which
recently removed from the city. She likes
her new work very much, she says. It Is
very dull all alone in headquarters some
nights, Bhe admits; but there is always
the fascinating possibility that something
might "break loose." In the* meantime,
the fair, desk sergeant whiles away the

PRETTY ROMANCE OF DOT AND DASH, ENDING IN BELLBOY
WILLIE FINNIGAN MAKING KATHERINE BOWERS HIS BRIDE
IT was a romance of the dot and dash.
And now winsome Miss Katherine
Bowers, just turned sixteen, is the
wife of William Flnnlga.n, who owns to
eighteen long years. Best of all, the
mothers are mollified, the law rests con
tent, and the police, who almost killed
the romance, beam in a fatherly way
above the young couple. They are in
Philadelphia, both working hard to make
the money to build a home of their own,
for life is all ahead of them.
"Katie" Bowers, as they called her,
was telegraph operator here in the Hotel
Belvedere, one of the largest and finest
hotels between Philadelphia and Palm
Beach, says the Baltimore correspondent
of the New York World. "Willie" Fin
nigan answered to the call "Front!" at
the same hotel so acceptably that he
made his $20 a week.

to do without him.
However, his place was a good one, and

well as any man. The objection was
raised that she would not be able to re
spond in I person to the calls for police
services.. The chief overruled this argu
jinent with the common-sense reply that
such qualification was not necessary in a
desk sergeant, for, while he (or she) was

told > him to learn it, he started in so
zealously that in a week he had. the
alphabet of the dot and -dash well enough
to write it down letter for letter.
USE THE MORSE CODE.
They, didn't know it then, but they
know it now at the Belvedere. Willie and
his sweetheart corresponded.r egularly in
the Morse code right under the eyes of
the watchful clerks at the desk. And
more, too. : When Willie was idling on his
bench and Katie sat disconsolate at' her
key her undaunted lover could send her
little love messages by tapping apparently
aimlessly on his 'bench with a pencil.
' Nor did ; they have to confess . their
sweet secret either," for- me hotel people
found it out when it was too lateâ when
Willie and Katie had fun away and were
married.
The : porter chanced to sweep out the
telegraph booth making ready for. Katie's
successor. On the floor he found, sev
eral notes written all in dots and dashes.
They were handed to another telegraph
operatorâ an , unromantic man -who* read
and smiled. r
Willie had written his notes behind the
marble pillars and had , sent them to , his
Katie by one of half a dozen of the blue
coated- messengers which were at . her
disposal. Here they are, and the bride
groom has frankly owned up to them now
that they have achieved 'him his happi

One fine afternoon the pretty telegraph
operator closeu her desk after a day's
work and said/ "Gqod-by!" to the night
operatorwho succeeded her.
, "I'm' going to be married to-morrow,'!
she aid. .
Nobody believed her. When she arrived
next. morning everybody said, "I told you
so!" -butâ -
: "I've resigned." announced Miss Bow
ers, with proper dignity, "because I'm
going to be married to-day."
''Willie'.' Finnigan promptly left the
hotel and. came back/ in an hour.
"I've got the license all right," he said,
with the due dignity of a bridegroom-to
be. "Now we'll go out and get married."
; And, sure enough', they did.
Then they.discovered that there were no
trains which would get them . into Phila
delphia untillong after midnight.
- "We'll , stay here at the Belvedere,",
announced the ex-bellboy, not at all non
plused by the fact that both had been
employes there. â¢ \
And stay they did. The room was $5
a day, Jbut that didn't bother the bride
groom one bit. Nor did the 13 breakfast
in the morning. Then they took the train
to Philadelphia.
And 'now:trouble began.'
Katie hadn't come home from her work
the night before. When it sot to be mid
night her mother, Mrs. McCagheyâ she
married a second time after the death of
Kr. tie's fatherâ grew very much alarmed.
So she. went out and telephoned to the
Belvedere to see If Katie had been there
to -work 'the day before.
"Katie's been married to .Willie Finni
gan," camo the answer over the wire,
"and they've gone to Philadelphia on
their, honeymoon."
' Mrs. McCaghey went at once to break
the news to \u25a0= Katie's ( new mother-in-law,
who broke at once into bitter. tears.
I ."And he ; was all the support I had!"
sebbed Mrs. Finnigan.
"Lot's see if; they're really married,"
suggested Mrs. McCaghey, the practical.
\u25a0 ;To the courthouse they went. Yes.
there on the marriage license book in the
big, .round writing of Clerk Henry was
the record of the license.
"That's wrong," announced Mrs.Flnni
gan." "Willies only 18; hs isn't 21."
:"Then I'm going to have him arrested,','
fairly! shouted Mrs. McCaghey, "he's a
perjurer! : If he'd told me his right age
he couldn't' have married my Katie with
out my consent."
WILLIE GOES TO JAIL. "
Now the determined Mrs. McCagheyj
started after Willie.'. All day she tried to
get his Philadelphia , address, but nobody
knew it. But'luck was with her. Next
morning there came a' charming little
letter from her daughter.
: ";A*. Baltimore detective took the nejit
train for Philadelphia. By noon William
Finnigan, \bridegroom, ex-bellboy and
writer of the Morse system of love-let
ters, was in .; the ; Philadelphia jail, while
his -bride of a: day wept at home. The
charge against him ; was perjury, and the
bail was $5000. , Four years in the penlten-.
tiary 'i stared the ; youthful bridegroom in
'the 'face. - " - '.
r All of which; would have been a* very,
very- sad- ending; to such a pretty little
romance. But . it^didn't'ena there. First
the Baltimore. Grand T Jury . must . indict
William 'Finnigan, alleged perjurer, . be

she Is made miserable by a very Jealous

"I have no good reason to doubt him,

"This makes me wretches and htm, too.

lives. I feel that ho Is beginning tolos*
his love for me. What shall I do to pro- â¢

My dear woman. It is you who are kill-
Ing the very affection you want to keep.
By your doubts and your suspicions â all
of them unfounded, I Inferâ you are chok
ing up the tender plant ot lovo with
weeds that are sura sooner or later to
destroy It.
The blindness of human beings In their
foolish methods of caring for this most
delicate of all growths Is a sourca of
constant wonder to me. No ona can as
pect to see a plant flourish and ba beau
tiful for any length of time it It Is not
properly tended.
1 Every one knows that In order to
thrive and blossom a plant needs Co be
guarded against destructive* Insects and
kept free from weeds.
Yet what do human beings do ' with
love? They bestow upon it tha most
harmful sort of treatment and still ex
pect It to flourish and put on. fresh leaves.
They seem to imagine that love Is so
hardy a plant it can withstand the rudest
handling and the unklndest neglect.
A more mistaken Idea of love's real
nature it would be impossible to find.
Love requires the constant nourishment
of faith and, trust and absolute confidence
for its growth. "When it lacks this
nourishment ait droops and withera as
would any delicate plant. When it 13 not

human beings wither it with doubt and
suspicion and choke it with Jealousy, fail
ing utterly to realize that destruction
through such treatment Is inevitable.
â¢ There is only one thing for you to do.
my dear woman, if you want to be happy
with your husband. Be resolute, look the
question squarely In the face and make
up your mind once for all whether or not
you really believe your husband to bo
worthy.
Decide whether you believe him to bo
deceiving you or telling you the â¢ truth
when he says your suspicions are without
foundation. Thl3 is aquestion you mu3t
decide for- yourself and you should lose
no time in doing it.
There is nothing that will so surely
undermine your health, your happiness,
your peace as the continual suspense and
torture that accompany Jealousy.
If you believe him true, then put away
from you forever your unworthy sus
picions. If you cannot so regard him,
tell him so frankly and come to a deflnlta
decision as to the future course you in
tend to pursue regarding him. .
Better leave him and end his misery
and yours than poison thÂ© home atmos
phere with your continual distrust and
consequent wretchedness.
To be absolutely square is the only
worthy course to adopt in a matter of
this kind. Either your husband is worthy
or he is . not. Decide, And forever rid
yourself of that greaÂ£est enemy to lova
and domestic peaceâ Jealousy.

HUMANE TOPICS
ft". Elfa Dearborn's Address on Fitness
â¢ in Matrimony Widely Talked 0K : -
LAURA BRIDE POWERS
. \u25a0 .
The (rend of thought in women's
ciubs rrrows each year more impersonal,
rriorv umnan and more practical.
This liiot is demonstrated in all the
PtiUo satherings of clubs and in the
national conventions, where iv the old
diÂ»ys, Keir^culturo â or what passed for
it â was the "reason" of the club.
Then it expanded Into taking a hand
in civic work, looking into social con
ditions, demanding more and- better
laws for the protection and care of
women and children, for the compul
spry education of the latter, for the
regulation of the time and conditions
of. their labor, and for the intelligent
direction and guidance of youthful law
breakers toward good citizenship.
These, and many kindred vital sub
jects, are now occupying the minds of
thinking women, and in the pioneer
work along these lines many prece
dents and time-honored usages were
smashed â much to the horror of those
to whom tradition is a religion.
Now comes a young woman â Dr.
Ella K. Dearborn of Portland â with a
set of statements regarding the propa
gation of the human' race that will
form a vital topic for club discussion
iv the year to come. Not that the
things ehe stands for are accepted by
clubwomen as conclusive, but they lead
the way to an intelligent, a practical
and a humane discussion of the great
est problem of the civilized world â the
reproduction of the human family.
As the press dispatches state. Dr.
Dearborn, irr"an address before a med
ical society in the Fair City, declares
for the chloroforming of the physically
unfit. Now, that part of her talk is
not new. and -is not especially worth
noting; but the second point she makes
Is the pivotal point of what must some
day become a matter of definite knowl
edge â and that Is her pronunclamento
thst none but the physically and mor
ally fit be permitted to marry. Of this
fche say?:
Under existing laws there is no way of weed
ing out contaminated subjects and bo they
marry, and It is their progeny that fills our
public institutions for criminals and the insane.
Tradition, sentiment and conventionality stand
in the way of scientific progress. There are
many people in the world who are not criminals
or degenerates or Invalids, but who are not fit
tfd to beget children. These persons should
net be ailowed to beget children. Let those of
the highest mental and physical attainment do
the child bearing â let the non-bearing popula
tion contribute toward the support and educa
tion of the well born children.
Now, these statements are somewhat
startling, but clear the cobwebs of
prejudice from your brain, and think
them over; and if you be equipped to
think straight, you cannot but find
ample evidence everywhere about you
to support the truth thus boldly stated.
And as to the last sentence concern
ing the support of well-born children,
Ibe public is now charged with the sup
port of foundlings, abandoned and de
linquent children, criminals and pau
pers. In fact, California last year sup
ported over 6000 children, most of
whom were children of mentally, mor
ally, or physically unfit parents â not to
mention those who were unable to sup
port their offspring through lncompe
lerice or worse.
Now that the matter has been.pub-
Mrly discussed here in the West â and
been discussed in the quiet of the clubs
for some time â many intelligent talks
v.'Jl be heard on this most vital topic
when the clubs convene again.
Ab for the Eastern clubs, these hu
man topics have long been under dis
cussion, the New York Federation of
Day Nurseries having made them the
leading subjects at its annual confer
ence last month.
And while few of the clubwomen of
San Francisco are yet prepared to draft
laws limiting marriage to the physic
ally, mentally and morally fit, the
moral education wrought In the discus
sions bears good fruit.
Have you ever beard Mrs. Charlotte
Perkiia GUman talk?
Then go to the Albambra on the even-
Ing of the 20thâ 8 o'clockâ and you'll hear
something worth while. Her topic Is
"America's Place To-day." Just what
lines she will follow I do not know, but
that It will be full of meat I do know.
As an advocate of equal rights. Mrs.
Gllman Is able. She Is likewise an earnest
Socialist. Therefore is It that the Wil
liam Morris Club Is assuming charge of
the lecture, which, by the way, is free,
and to It Is Invited every progressive
thinker along those lines, and even those
whose ypiT)Â«iÂ» are hermetically sealed, for
It Is barely possible that a real warm
argument would melt the wax, and a new
thought percolate within.
Next week the National League of
Business Women, formed last year at
the St. Louis Exposition, will hold Its
annual convention In New York, and a
large contingent goes from the West.

drank It more, with the result that his j
kidneys became affected, and he suffer- j
cd grreatly with pains and despondency,
till, as he says, 'coffee nearly killed me! 1
So he stopped using: it and began to
drink Postum Coffee. It cured him; and
In a very short time his kidneys re-
sumed their normal functions, his pains
were nllayed, and the despondency
which had nearly driven him ora.zy
ccr.sc<! to trouble him.
"My little boy. a year old, had, suffer-
ed, ever since he was weaned, from
stomach and bowel troubles. He could
not properly digest the milk he drank.
It passed out of his bowels in hard
lumps, sometimes large and again like
small pellets, frequently producing dlar- j
rhoea, and then we would have to call j
in the doctor. But the trouble returned, j
again and again.
"We used 50 give him a taste of Fost-
ura Coffee occasionally, and as I saw
that he relished it and realized how
much good it had done his father, I be-
gan to put a little In his bottle of milk.
Tha effect was bo salutary that I grad-
ually Increased In quantity, till at last
I used only enough milk to give it coloi.
He thrived wonderfully on It. He is

Two weeks ago the husband of Mrs.

was taken to the Detention Hospital, a

she loved caused her mind' to give, way.'
She will be turned over to the Insanity/
Commission, and in a few Says she will
probably be remanded t<J one of the State
institutions for keeping.
When the ambulance called for, the
insane woman yesterday afternoon the
officers found her screaming and crying
in her apartments, without clothing of
any kind. She would- not consent to be
clothed, and the officers were forced to
send for a closed cab and take her away
in her naked condition. : She was later
dressed at the Central Emergency Hos
pital. . . N ' ! .
The case of Mrs. Jonas is a sad one.
She is a young woman, and It was only
a short time ago that she became a
bride. With all the love of a young girl
she began her married life, and to her
the dream was one of perfect happiness.
Then, she never Quito knew why, her
husband, who is a bartender, -left her
suddenly. There were harsh words. That
was two weeks ago, and he has never
returned to his home. %
Meanwhile his . young bride waited for
him. She whiled the hours away by try

duties that had been such a pleasure to
her. Still he did not come back. Her
heart began to fill with dread. Then Bhe

young life she gave way to her misery.
Neighbors could not comfort her nor
could they stop her piteous sobbing. ' At

ARTFUL HAILED
AS TURF QUEEN
All Horsemen Agree That
the Filly Is the Peer
of Her 3lany Star Rivals
BELDA3fE NOT AS GREAT
Racing Public Longs for a
Contest Between Whitney's
Mare and Great Sysonby
Special Diaratch to The Cait.
NEW YORK. July 9. â Ar.ful's victory
t in the Brighton Beach Handicap wa's
the chief topic ot conversation among:
. turfmen to-day. All agreed that her
performance stood out alone â that no
other filly, not even Beldame last year,
had demonstrated her class so clearly.
Artf-ul proved conclusively on Satur
day, the turfmen declared, that she
eclipsed other great mares of the turf â
the Flrenze, Mies "Woodford, Imp and
Beld&me.
until Imp upset all precedents, it was
considered a settled fact that no mare
could win any of the big handicaps
la the spring and summer. Trainers
â¢aid their Eex was against them. Then
Imp came along. Whatever doubt still
lingered was removed by Beldame's
sterling performance in the Suburban.
But the greatest of all was the work
of Artful. When Conroy won the
Brooklyn Handicap, horsemen were
surprised. They did not believe that a
'three-year-old colt could possibly ac
â¢ complish such a task, but when Broom
stick won the Brighton -.andicap and
smashed all turf marks for a mile and
a Quarter In the bargain, he was
hailed as the greatest little colt Ameri
can breeders had ever produced.
But all these performances, great as
they were, are now eclipsed. Artful
stands alonÂ£, not only as the greatest
three year old, but as the greatest
three-year-old filly. Sensational as
S?ysonby's performances have been this
year, horsemen declare that they sink
into insignilicanee compared with Art
ful's victory in the Brighton Handicap.
f Sysonby's best races have been with
\u25a0 colts of his own age. Artful's success
was accomplished when racing against
.horses much older.
The prowess of Sysonby and Artful
raises a question, asked so frequently
arter ihe latter's success in the Futur
ity â whicli is the better horse? Artful
. defeated Sysonby in that event, how
â¢ ever, but with a big advantage in
. -ight. Many turfmen believe that if
â¢ the scale were high â 126 pounds for the
<olt and 121 pounds for the filly, regu
lation scale for a contest between
i..r*><*-yeiir-olds â Sysonby would beat
Artful over a distance of ground, as he
\u25a0 is. a much bigger horse und can handle
weight better. But with light weight
up. cay 110 pounds, on Sysonby, and 105
pounds on Artful, turfmen favor the
ul!y*6 chances. It is not likely these
two great horses will meet until fall.

SEALS' HOPES ARE SHATTERED BY DEFEAT
STARS READY
TO UNIONIZE
Prominent National League
Players Are Working Out
Samuel Gompers' Pet Plan
TROUBLE FOR .3LVGXATES
Indications Are That \ the
Men WiJlJoin With Amer
ican Federation of Labor
Sr<cial CabJo to The Call.
NEW YORK. July 9.â Two of the
most prominent players in the National
League, whoso names cannot be used
for obvious reasons, are said to be
quietly working for the formation of
a baseball players' branch of the Amer
ican Federation of Labor in this city.
For many years Samuel Gompers
has teen trying to induce players in
the major leagues to organise unions in
various la.-ge cities, but has never met
with any success up to the present
year, owing perhaps to the fact that
the players have a strong organization
of their own. This year, Gompers*
proposition is meeting with consider
able favor and the prospects are that
baseball players all over the country,
will be admitted to the American Fed
eration of Labor in a body next fall.
Since the disruption of the players' or
ganization Immediately following the
debut of the American League as a ma
jor organization, the men have felt that
they have no way of commanding ar
bitration of their grievances with the
various baseball clubs.
One of the New York champions said
to-day: "Players are. now organizing
in every major league city for the pur
pose of forming American Federation
locals. Next fall they will join the
American Federation in a body.
"The men have ho Intention of par
ticip&dng In strikes, sympathetic or
otherwise; nor do we desire to influ
ence baseball attendance to the detri
ment of the club owners. We simply
want a chance to arbitrate when we
have a grievance or when league offi
cers refuse to give urÂ» a fair hearing."
By joining hands with the American
Federation of Labor, the players will
at once possess themselves of a power
ful weapon which, it is-belicved, will be
held over the head of any ball club
that failed to arbitrate grievances with
Its men or give them a hearing. In
case of a refusal to do so, the labor
unions in baseball towns would
promptly place the seal of disapproval
upon offending clubs and the attend
ance would immediately fall to noth
ing, for the reason that union fans
would not pay to see the particular
club play. This would hit the club's
pocketbook and doubtless force it to
terms.
Next season, the baseball magnates
will probably meet trouble with their
farming scheme, for the players are
greatly opposed to this plan and will
doubtless enter a strong objection as
soon as they have Gompers behind
them. There are many other little
sores that the men say will have to be
healed.

The Â» Angels ceased loafing : yesterday, L
and their little spell of energy netted two
games. The first one at ; Oakland was
just like finding lost money,-, but in- the
afternoon event the Commuters began to
office up to Tozier's spit ball In the final
stages. With the - score 5 to 4 in the
ninth, Dunleavy popped out to Brashear,
instead of hitting"' safe, 'when Buck
Francks was hugging third and j longing
to place the imprint of his number- 10 in
the pan. Lt;
Xobody seemed to care whether - the
score was 100 to 1 or 1 to 1 till Oakland
began to show, a tendency to ; win j when
the game seemed lost. : Then the rooters
began to shout, and it was evident Oak
land had a few friends in . the house.
Brick Devereaux started a .Temescal
hornpipe in the rear of third base, ana
everything was lovely for a while. '
Dunleavy wa3 \u25a0 the first Commuter to
wake up, singling against j the right-nela
fence in the eighth. Kruger advanced
him, and Moskiman put him through
with a j single past Flood. This started
the crowd rooting, though their, efforts
seemed in vain, when Stanley, batting for
lberg, died easily in the ninth. ;
But Papa Van Haltrcn copped- off. a
two-bagger to, right and Buck ; Francks
tore off one to center, putting Van over
the Jumps. By this time Devereaux had
the a crowd . worked uo with his ' fantastic
hot 'step and every one was yelling- for
hits. ; Buck stole second .and .went to
third on a wild peg, but Kelly died and
so did Dunleavy, bo the I shouting j was
never completed.
The Angels .got a good start In the
first inning, when lberg walked both
Bernard and Flood. Dillon, Smith and
BrasJiear bunted both men through. Oak
land" grabbed one in the same, spasm,
when Francks was soaked in the. solar
plexus, stole two bases. and arrived while
Brashear was busy fielding; Kelly out at
first. :'-. â¢>",-â¢; " i \u25a0 .\u25a0;-'.. -^ : . \u0084-\u25a0:," \ \
The Angels began to wise up to . Ham
Iberg's hesitaters in the fourth and fifth,
walloping the leather hard enough to
chase three more in and cinch the result.
It might have been worse but for Van
Haltren's foxy play in the eighth. Bra
shear had singled 1 and gone to third on
Ross' two-cushion stab ; to left. No one
was out when Van Haltren.rushed in and
covered second. Byrnes pegged the ball
down and Ross was a dead ; one In jig
time. This was the first time the play
was ever pulled off on the j lot. . ;
Oakland and Los Angeles will play a
postponed game this afternoon at Recre
ation Park at 3:30.. To-morrow the two
teams will mix it at Oakland as usual.

SCH-aiDT FINED AND LAID OFF.
The Oakland baseball management
handed, Pitcher'Heine Schmidt an awful
bunch 1 yesterday when they 'decided to
flne H the?slabsterslo<Kand lay him'off
for thirty days because he was ungen
tlemanly enough ato \u25a0 take :a ; punch *at
Pitcher Hogan in Seattle the other day.
This seems unjust punishment for the
reason that Schmidt- hit , Hogan In a
saloon; after' working hours. But the
management -seems to want to show
the pltcher.up and he will hava to stand
for the rough workJ According to the
story* the two ballplayers ''got, into an
argument v while ? partaking of a" few
steanisand Schmidt beat Hogan to the
punch * when â¢it - became time to> fight.
Schmidt's -absence will weaken? the
Oakland team;: as iit has but two more

NO MORE BICYCLING
FOR LEE KEE JOKE
3lachine He Hoped Would
Save Him From Boys
Proves His Undoing.
Lee Kee Joke is a little Chinese boy
who has Just come out jof the seclusion
of his Oriental home at 616 â¢ Stockton
etreet, arid he is barely beginning to learo
of the pleasures and pains of modern
civilization. His bequeued father re
cently presented him \u25a0 with a brilliantly
painted, model 1593, bicycle.
"Velly fine," quoth Lee Kee Joke, who
did not know that automobiles were tha
only proper means of transportation these
days and that to givo ; a man a bicycle
was an insult to "â¢ his sense of progress.
"Him ma flen. Lil boys pulle pig tailee
no more. Ride byâ swishâ burVr."
It would have been all right with tha
fortunes of little Lee Kee Joke had he'
not tried . to escape from his American
tormentera on the stony hills of Dupont
6treet. "Hoop-lee!" shouted the young
Celestial to a group of admiring "chop
sueys" on the sidewalk, "watch me. Boy
no catchee now. Me . too slif t. Hoop
lee!"
It was at this point of the wild ride
that Washington street was reached.
Billy McGlynn. â¢ with his coupe, was

The body off LJm Moon .. Chuck, a Chi
nese doctor who had an office at-904:Du

janitor of a lodging-house at 844 Wash

face downward on the floor and there
was every \u25a0 indication that: he had been
strangled with his own queue and rob
bed. The police* are "endeavoring to un

/Freel followed, up the case yesterday
and learned- from ChinVKee; Ling,- jan
itor at 904 Dupont street, that the docÂ£
tor received &~. call about \u25a02 1 o'clock ; on
Saturday afternoon to go to ; 844 Wash

and strangle him. Freel 'was unable
to obtain any information from any of
