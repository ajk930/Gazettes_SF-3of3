thrown over his face, and brought 1 to -.the
door of the saloon. This had a quieting;
effect on the mob and it soon dispersed.
Late to-night Charles Poske was . shot
in the shoulder by a' colored. man during
a disturbance at . Twenty-third street and
Stewart* avenue. Poske is watchman in
a coal yard. ' \.^
The trouble started when James Gray
accused Bernstein and a white companion
of being trouble-makers. Since the team
sters' strike Gray has been employed by
a coal company as a driver. The merits
of the strike and the shooting of young
Carlson were up for discussion, .\nsry
words soon led to blows and in tho fight
that followed Gray drew a knife and at
tacked the men. Bernstein, who Is a
bartender, drew a revolver and fired four
phots. Two of the bullets took effect In
Gray's body. He fell unconscious and
died while, .being removed to a hospital.
As Bernstein and his companion were
leaving the scene two coioree men seized
the bartender and a scuffle for possession
of the revolver began. Special Policeman
Tlnsley, colored; came runnmg up. See-
Ing the colored policeman approaching
Bernstein, swung- the- revolver toward him
and, according to Trnsley, discharged the
weapon twice.- Tinsley returned the fir.*,
shjooting four, bullets Into Bernstein's
body/ 1 Bernstein fell unconscious and a
crowd that had gathered made toward
Tlnsley and the wounded man. With the
assistance of another, negro Tinsley pick
ed Bernstein up and ran into a nearby
saloon. Tlnsley stood in the doorway
with drawn revolver. The crowd, which
was composed of negroes, was crying for
vengeance for the killing of Gray and
Tinsley, seeing that unassisted he would
not be able to keep it back, shut "and
barred the door. ,
In a riot that broke out in this district
to-night between the whites ajid the
blacks James Gray, colored, was killed,
Harry Bernstein was mortally wounded
and a building in which Bernstein, a
white man suffering from four bullet
wounds, was being held a. captive, was
stoned and partially wrecked by a mob
of 1000 . persons.

ST. PETERSBURG. May 2Lâ The desir
ability of securing, the revocation of the
Imposition by Russia of the maximum
duty on American imports, levied in re
taliation for the imposition of a, counter
vailing duty by the United States upon,
Russian sugars, which Embassador Mey
er is trying to adjust, is assuming addi
tional importance owing to the fact that
the new Russo-German tariff, which goes
into effect at the end of the year, will
form the basis for a **most favored: na
tion" clause.
,That treaty raises the duties on ma
chinery and other articles in which
American exporters to Russia are espe
cially interested and the new general.
or maximum, tariff, with corresponding
increases, goes into effect simultaneously.
Consequently unless the Russo- American
tariff dispute be adjusted American Im
ports are destined to bear still further
burdens. If the dispute be adjusted the
United States will get the benefit under
the "favored nation" clause, not only of
the reduction accorded to Germany, but
also under the new commercial treaty
about to be negotiated. with France.
â¢ The Russian Government seems to be
sincerely anxious to again place the Unit
ed States on the most favored nation ba
sis; but naturally would like to see the
old status quo restored.

was s-aid to-day that his real ailment
had proved to be nervous dysptp.sia, of
a type similar to that which aifected
his father for years. The trouble is at
tributed In large part to the cars and
worry growing out of the great respon
sibiÂ«t:.- that had developed upon the
young ma-j since his father transferred
to him actual otScia! contro. of his share
in the Standard Oil Company and the
various banking and railroad corpora
lions affiliated with the great kerosene
monopoly.
Although outwardly the Rockefellers,
father and son, have appeared to be
much a!iÂ«te in a certain placidity of tem
pormeiH, it is said by those who know
the son that he is in reality of a nervous
disposition.
Young Rockefeller has devoted himself
with every stow of enthusiasm to his
Bible class, and has withi i the last few
months gone publicly on record as say
ing some sharp things about modern
business men. He has preached absolute
poverty. He has said thst a corporation
that did not do pood tP others as well as
to itself would ultimately fail. All of Ida
lal.'s to his class have bi.en marked by
earnestness.
RorkoWlcr Jr.. according to this mem
ber of tho Bible c:a*s, had made it cicar
to Rockefeller Sr. that he did not ap
prove of all of the Standard Oil's raod:s
of dotes business, but regarded them as
affording at the Jeast an exct:se for the
dry which had been raised against '*iaint

General Ybarda. the Venezuelan Min
ister of Foreign Relations, declared that
not even if tho army and navy of the
United States -came to, the shores of
Venezuela would the Government consent
to arbitrate the' case until it had been
decided, in the courts. If the concession
of the., asphalt company has been - an
nulled as reported. \u25a0 the Venezuelan: Gov
ernment will be requested to arbitrate the
question of the rights of the company.
In Vofflcial circles- iÂ£ is stated that
Venezuela is now deprived of the excuse
hitherto urged against arbitration.
The New .York and Bermudez Company
has convinced Mr. ' Roosevelt and Secre
tary Taft that it has suffered great
wrong at - the hands of Venezuela, . that]
the receivership , and Ithe seizure of the'
property ordered several months ago by
the Venezuelan courts were unjust. and
that Castro exercises j such an influence
upon the courts that.no equity has been
possible for them in" the republic. Acting
upon this conviction, the State Depart
ment made, through Minister Bowen at
Caracas a request, which was .nearly an
ultimatum, that Venezuela; agree to sub
mit to' arbitration* the- controversy con
cerning the asphalt company. The
Venezuelan Government responded that
this could not be done, that the case
was stilJ pending in the courts of
Venezuela. '\u25a0

LONDON, May 21.â Arbitration 'is to
settle a strike at Belfast, Ireland, be
tween an American contracting firm and
its employes. Eleven hundred men em
ployed by J. G. White & Co. of New York
and London and engaged in the construc
tion of the electric street railway system
of the Belfast corporation recently walk
ed out because of dissatisfaction wtlh
their wages. They had been getting
eleven cents per hour. The contract
amounts to $2,675,000 and the work must
be completed by September 1 under heavy
penalty.
Tho same firm has been paying from
fourteen to sixteen cents an hour in Lon
don for a similar sort of labor. The con
tract made with the corporation of Bel
fast expressly states the minimum rate
payable. A representative of the con
tracting ftrrri says that for the first time
in Great Britain they were able to secure
a strike clause In the orlgriial contract:
allowed in view of the requirement for
rapid construction. : '
Laboring men here are greatly sur
prised at the employes' agreement to go
back, under the old terms, pending the
outcome of the arbitration proceedings,
which are to be conducted solely by rep
resentatives of the . men and the con
tracting firm.
"What connection do you charge that
Secretary Loeb had with what you say
was a conspiracy, to get possession of
the manuscripts of your book and of the
Platt letters?" she was asked.
"In answer to that I will simply say
that J. Martin Miller, a poorly-fed, , in
conspicuous correspondent for a country
newspaper, * was made a secret service
agent and acted under instructions from
higher authority in the part he played In
the conspiracy. I never talked with Mil
ler about my private affairs and he could
not possibly have had any personal in
terest in them. Someone else must have
talked with him about them and in his
efforts to get my manusenpr and J letters
he must have acted under instructions
from some one in authority. Whorwaa
that some one? When the case comes to
trial I shall- be glad to tell the -whole
story." . â . . .. - '\u25a0 . \u25a0
"When Senator Platt was in New York
after our engagement ho used to write
and wire to me in his autocratic way to
come to New York to spend Sunday with
him, he being too old' and decrepit to
make the journey to see me. On numer
ous occasions Wynrfe and his friends used
to order me to New York to secure for
them some favor from Platt. I \u25a0 recall
that once I was ordered there by J. J.
Howley. Wynne's chief clerk, to ask
Senator Platt to back Wynne for Post
master General Payne's place in the Cab
inet.. Wynne was resolved that Payne
should go, and he: was hot after his job.
In time these attempts to use mo to fur
ther the political inteiest3 of Wynne and
his gang grew very tiresome, especially'
since I was always under the espionage
of secret service men from the' depart
ment.
"In April, 1903. I was sent to New York
to intercede with Senator Platt in behalf
of Wynnes chief clerk. On my arrival
there I found. a state of affairs so dis
gusting that 1 balked right then and
there. When Platt came to see me 1 told
him I was done with him and the whole
disgusting . business, and r I told ; him ' why.
He .at once flew into a rage and demand
ed to know what 1_ proposed to do about
it. I told him I "had as much â¢ temper
and determination as he had, and masked
him what lie supposed wou.'u happen if
we should clash. ,
."'Why, you would be relegated to the
rear very quickly,' said he.

i And so when you turn, to Scotland and the
Scottish Reformation, aa Fronde has said:
"The one supremely great man that Scotland
possessed â the one man without whom Scot

would, have had .no existence, was John
Knox." Verily the name of ' John Knox is the'
cliief esC' on the â¢ long > list ' of Scotland's heroes
and worthies
That chapter of her history which thrills
U3 most â which stirs our righteous resent
ment, awakene our noblest impulses, fires our
purposes and desires for the triumph of truth,
and begets a consecration to the cause of Pro
testant Christianity i* the records of the
sublime energy, the heroic daring, , the con
spicuous faith, the determined perseverance,
the consecrated talents, the unconquerable pur
pose or Scotland's chief est sonâ John Knox.
If you are looking for men or firm and un
deviatmg devotion to conscientious conviction
and unswerving allegiance to high nforal prin
ciple in the path of rectitnde, then John Knox
will be among' the greatest in the foremost
files of time. If you are seeking men of com
manding influence among Individuals and over
nationsextending to -increasing generations
then among the best examples John Knox will
be conspicuous.
It has been declared by high authority that
the history of Scotland -is the history of the
Reformation, and that the htetory of the Ref

PHILADELPHIA, . May 21.â The long
looked-for appearance of Battling Nel
son in the East will take place to-mor
row night, when the Dane will box Abe
Attell. the feather-weight champion.
Great interest has been taken in Nel
son since he came here, although the
Western boy; has somewhat chilled en
thusiasm by his refusal to meet Willie
Lewis 'of New York, | unless the latter
weighs 130 pounds at 6 o'clock the night
of the bout, while he would not have to
weigh in. . â¢ . -
In view of Nelson's announcement that
he is "a fighter, pure and simple," fight
fans view his action in the Lewis matter
with suspicion. Attell, who will meet
. Nelson to-morrow, is \u25a0 a boxer, not a
fighter. It is expected here he will do
to Nelson what' be 'did. to Tommy Mur
phyâmake him look cheap. However, if
Nelson corners the elusive Attell it will
be all up with the latter.

FORT WORTH, Tex., May U.â A heavy
windstorm, blowing at the rate of- seventy
miles an hour, struck this city from the
southwest at 6:30 o'clock to-night. : Part
of the west wall of the Texas and Pa
cific passenger station was blown in and
John Young, a train dispatcher, killed.
The storm .was most severe west of the
city and all telephone and telegraph

The Chino ranch is considered one of
the mest valuable properties in the south
ern part of the State, and has been the
object of negotiations several times in
the last few years. The ranch consists
of 30.fr X) acres and includes a large
amount of personal property. Among the
assets are a railroad and valuable rolling
stock, i such as locomotives, \ passenger
and freight cars, traction engines, devel
oped and producing oil wells, and their
complete outfit, business blocks, farm
houses and farming implements.
For a long time the title to the ranch
was clouded, but these difficulties have
been cleared, and with the advent of a
new owner it is understood that the prop
erty will be opened for settlement. The
purchase price is said to exceed $1,000,000
by several hundred thousand. "
"It Is true that a syndicate, with which
Edward T. Earl of Los Angeles and I
are identified, is negotiating for the. Chino
ranch," said Mr. Marshall, "and I regret
that the fact has become public' I came
to this city to" see other parties connected
with the matter, but had hoped to keep
the purpose of my visit secret."
A deal is now under way in this city
that \u25a0will probably result ; to-day or to
morrow In the sale of the famous Chino
ranch in San Bernardino County. ;
E. J. Marshall, vice president of the
Southwestern National Bank of Los An
geles, arrived here yesterday in connec
tion with the deal, and . admitted , last
night that he expected to complete it
within the next forty-eight hours. He
declined to enter into the details of the
transaction until it is completed, on the
grounds that it involves a great sum of
money and any interference would mean
a great loss.- ? -^?. N .'-^VV
It was on the occasion of her recent
visit to -Santa Barbara that she first met
the Count, at.d it is said that the noble
man was immediately smitten with the
fair ycuag woman. The Count and the
Countess own a beautiful place in Reg
ensburg, Bavaria, and are possessed of
considerable wealth. They have shown a
desire to travel ia this country, and in
vested considerable money three years
ago in the Southwest. â¢ They have been
in ihe ha.bit of making regular visits to
California durins the winter months.
The first meeting between the Count
and Miss .Harrison is said to have been
followed by a. proposal from him, but
iliss Harrison. although seemingly
pleased with the handsome Bavarian's
attentions, was. it is said, a bit shy of
giving- him encouragement in his hur
riedly conceived matrimonial plans. Still
he persisted, and no one in the south was
surprised when the Count and his mother.
contrary to their winter custom, came
north to San Francisco immediately after
Miss Harrison and Miss Kaye had de
parted from Santa Barbara. News as to
whether the Count will overtake Miss
Harrison at Colorado Springs or follow
her on to Philadelphia is eagerly awaited
by society, which is wildly speculating
in the interim.
The Count took advantage of the first
opportunity to Inquire Quietly of the
clerk if Miss Harrison and her
were guests at the hotel, and upon learn
ing that the young women had left he
showed positive signs of disappointment.
For several days he busied himself try
ing to learn the destination of the two
yocrig wemen, and finally getting the
iiiicrrnaxion that they were to stop off
at Colorado Springs, he hastened the
departure of himself and his dignified
do tier in the same direction.
"Future mail shall be sent to The Ant
lers," was the hurried instructions left
by the Count, and since he disappeared
from the St. Francis speculation has
been rife as to whether he will be suc
cessful in his reported attempt to win
the fceart o! the Philadelphia heiress.
Miss Ks.rrison is well-known in Califor
nia, where she visits every year, and es
pecially in Santa Barbara, where she is
wort to spend the greater part of her
Btay in the West, and where she is con-
Etar.tly an object of attention from the
members of Eastern society that winter
there, and the subject of much conver
sation among- her own sex. She is an
"oui-aoor girl." who has few superiors in
h&rsemanship. golf or other fresh air
Eport. Although she feigns a mannish
air and carries a swagger stick, the fact
in no way seems to lessen her feminine
attractiveness, and everywhere she trav
els she finds many among the male sex
devoted to her. -.'. "

DOES SOME TRAtLCSG.
Ibe Ferris' stock 'company presented
"Way. Out "West" last night at the Grand
Opera-house without Florence Stone in
the leading role. Miss Stone was sup
posed to-be starring as a r blind Indian
girl, though she did not have much to do.
She was given a warm welcome when she
appeared on the stage for the first time
and showed her versatility.
Dick Ferris was the shining light of the
production, which is built on the lines of
"Arizona," Ferris was the center of ac
tion and danger from the moment he ap
peared on the stage in the first act. He
was kept busy doing hero stunts through
out the play, posing in the dual role of
twin brothersâ one a cowboy and the
other, an army officer. Frederick Julian
as the chaplain, Frank Sheridan as . the
colonel and A. Byron Beasley as the vil
lain were all much in evidence, and
played their parts very creditably. Lans
ing Rowan, Edith Julian and Marion Bal-
Hni were the leading female performers.
This evening the newsboys of the
city "will be admitted free to the play
through the generosity of Mr. Ferris.
Hundreds of tickets have been dis
tributed and the lads are promised an
enjoyable evening.
Charles H. Burke and Grace La Rue.
with their two lively "inky boys," pre
sented a lively sketch. Burke at once
established himself as a favorite. He is
a comedian of the best ranK and his pat
ent telephone, connecting with both the
upper and the Jower region, is one of the
funniest Orpheumisms sprung for a long
time. Miss La Rue sang "Billy"
Brackett's new waltz song, "Dear Old
Frisco," which was duly applauded.
- John Birch, who produces a whole
melodrama himself," assuming the dif
ferent parts by merely changing hats, is
still one. of the real hits.
This is certainly a great week for those
who appreciate vaudeville and know the
way to the Orpheum.
The Orpheum has a show this week
that the people cannot stay away from.
It is one of the record breakers for merit.
Perhaps the best thing on the bill is
the "Dr. Jekyll and Mr.. Hyde in Twenty
Minutes" by Emmett Corrigan and his
company, though, of their kind, there are
other features just as good. Mr. Corri
gan gives a representation of the dual
role in Robert Louis Stevenson's creepy
work that is one of the best things' evÂ«r
seen here. . His transformation from
the benign, lovable Dr. Jekyll to
the monster. Hyde, before the eyes
of the audience is almost weird
and is certainly one of the clev
erest things in stagecraft. The
rendering of the play in twenty minutes
is a taking idea. The audience is given
a good conception of the story on the
Orpheum stage.
Delia Fox was among the favorites and
her reappearance In the city was warmly
greeted. She sang some catchy songs in
a catchy way and was fgiven applause
and a great bunch of roses that glad
dened the heart of the comic opera fa
vorite, as shown by her_.apparent delight
when the flowers hove in sight, propelled
by an usher, who was lost to sight be
hind their mass of color.
Mabelle Adams, the "character violin
ist," is a charming young woman with
entrancing white arms. She played sweet
ballads and patriotic airs' in a medley, and
some classic pieces that made the 'gal
lery look dignified. She was applauded
for both.
Graceful and charming as ever,
Florence Roberts greeted her San
Francisco friends at the California
Theater last night after her long trip
through the East. Every seat in the
house was tilled by an enthusiastic ad
mirer. The play was "The Unwelcome
ilrs. Hatch," and the emotional young
actress showed her wonderful ability
to as great advantage in it as in those
pieces of French complexion where lo
cal play-goers have seen her more fre
quently.
In the scenes where she denounced
the woman -who had stolen her hus
band and where she is reunited with
her daughter Miss Roberts had her
audience at her feet. At the close of
the third act her hearers kept the cur
tain going until she made a pretty lit
tle speech and threw a kiss. Most of
the female portion of the audience was
moved to shed tears at the sad chap
ters in the story.
Herschel Mayall, who has lately been
slaying bandits at the Central, played
the part of the cruel husband with the
success which usually attends his ef
forts. Georgie Woodthorpe looked after
the humorous and pathetic character of
Agnes, the old servant, to the eminent
satisfaction of the house. The others
of the cast performed their duties in a
highly acceptable manner..
It was Miss Roberts, however, and
not the play, that most of the* people
went to see. The applause was almost
continuous. The earnest little actress
wore herself out in her endeavor to
satify her hearers. She never, had any
difficulty in filling the Alcazar, and
from the present outlook she will
crowd the California during her stay.

The Perm Mutual life Insurance Co., of PhaadeipWa.
On. the 7th day of December, 1904^ by its Board of Trustees, unanimously adopted the follow-
ing resolution: ;
"BE IT RESOLVED by the Trustees of The Perm Mutual life Insurance Company of

â¢ â¢ busfness management and of the security end character of its investments, that the Presi-
dent of the Company request the Insurance Commissioner of Pennsylvania, together with
the Insurance Commissioners of Massachusetts and Wisconsin, either in person or by
deputies, to make a full and complete examination of the affairs and investments of the
Company, as provided for by, law, said examination to be made as early as can be arranged
after the closing of the accounts of the Company for the current year."
; r^e I request- of the Trustees was granted, and on the first day of February, 1905, the examina-

STANFORD UNIVERSITY, May 21. â
The first actual ceremony marking the
graduation of the class of 1905 took
place In the Memorial Church this
morning, where the seniors gathered
with their friends to listen to a bacca
laureate sermon by Rev. S. B. L. Pen
rose, president of Whitman ColleÂ«Â«.
Wash. Or
At 11 o'clock the gradnates entered
the church and filed slowly down tUÂ«
long central aisle. The young woman
graduates, attired In the somber black
caps and gowns of scholars, led tha
procession, marching two abreast. They
were followed by the young men, sim
ilarly attired, and the heads of depart
ments. They were ushered to seats re
served for them.
Chaplain IX C. Gardner of Memorial
Church, who was in charge of taa ser
vices, offered prayers for thÂ» outgoinr
students. According to an honored
custom, the first scripture lesson was
read by Dr. David Starr Jordan, presi
dent of tho university. The second les
son was given by Rev. C. E. Mllnes of
the First Methodist Church of Palo
Alto.
The baccalaureate sermon, delivered
by Rev. Penrose. was full of Inspira
tion and good thoughts for the young
men and women whom It ushered into
the busy world. It was based upon a
double text taken from the H Corin
thians and I Peter; The simplicity
which is in Christ â¢ â¢ â¢ in whom
are hid all treasures of knowledge."
Upon this thought the minister de
livered a powerful sermon, closing with
a direct benediction to the graduates.
His closing words were:
Members of the graduating class, I have pre
sented for your consideration the first deep
lesson of life. Receive. Let me conclude with
the second. Give. "Freely have ya received,
freely give." Receive the beat, then give your
best. \u25a0 God forbid that you- should not receive
your best or that you should give your worst.
The world needs life and grace and power. Be
givers, and 'so saviors of the world. "The God
of all grace, who hath called us Into hla eternal
glory by Christ Jesus, after that ye have suf
fered awhile, make you perfect, Kablish.
strengthen, settle you. To, him be glory and
dominion forever and ever. Amen."

There are many forms of oppression which
must be met by the laboring man of the preo
ent day, among - them being oppression of
wealth, the oppression of color, and the op
pression of the wrong sort of labor union.
! A serious form of union oppression is the
present apprentice laws of many labor unions.
So rigid are these laws In some organizations
that if a boy wishes to learn a particular
trade he must of necessity enter either a non
union or an open shop. The evils of this sy*
tem are obvious, for It operates ajralnst the
American boy who wishes to learn a trade In
favor of the skilled mechanic of foreign birth.
' Regarding strikes and boycotts, I believe
that in the near future they will be eliminated
by the unions for their own protection. It Is
well known that but a small fraction of the
total membership of any union takes part In
the active work of the organization. In this
way action is often voted which Is not fa
vored by the majority .of the members, but
which they must support because a vote has
been taken by the union.
In many instances labor troubles are brought
on by the floating workman, who, after aiding
with his vote to cause a strike or a boycott.
Immediately departs from the scene of the
trouble, leaving the man with a family whose
home Is In the strike-ridden district to bear
the brunt of the battle with which Be Is per
haps not in sympathy. .

of the present and future was the theme

the auspices of the District Council of
Carpenters and was attended .by many
local union leaders. The speaker said in
part: v 1,.'-^Â±
The purpose of the labor union of to-day Is
a greater one than that -of mere self-preser
vation. It should aid In the education of its
individual members, to the end that they may
render the best possible service to themselves
as well as to their employers. - Labor organ
izations should encourage good work, la order
that to be known as a member of the union
is to be \u25a0 known as a skilled and competent
\u25a0workman. .

to a complaint charging flve Chinese ar
rested for using- a v^uinese shrimp net to
catch fish in San Pablo Bay, and who
are j now. out on bonds, . with perjury.
They \ were arrested last | Wednesday by

their bonds were fixed , and their prelim
inary examination set for last Saturday.
At the preliminary examination , the
four Chinese swore that the Chinese ar

the name of Ung Gingg was called Dep
uty Davis discovered that another Chi
nese had been substituted, and called the
substitution to the attention of the court.
Justice Pryor issued a bench warrant for
Ung Gingg and the deputy commissioner
executed It In short order.
The Justice was about to declare the
bond of Ung Gingg forfeited when a. flaw
was discovered in the document. One
bond was executed -by the flve Chinese,
although each man was charged on a
separate complaint, and? the word "he"
was used instead of "they." The court
then ordered the men put under heavier
bonds and demanded a separate bond for
each prisoner. Ah Mock was declared
guilty of criminal contempt of court and
sent to the County Jail for punishment.
Justice Pryor said to-day that he would
make an example of the Chinese.

BERKELEY, May 21.â Up the ter
raced slopes of the university campus
to the Greek Theater thousands of Ger
man-Americans, members of the Ger
man societies of Alameda "County,
â¢walked in a mighty throng and gath
ered to participate in the memorial
exercises for the poet Schiller.
The fact that the affair was planned
originally for May 9 and had to be
postponed two weeks because of the
u-eather, served not at all, apparently,
to detract trom the interest of the Ger
man societies in , the event. The day
was warm, the white stone seats of the
Greek Theater dazzled with the bril
liancy of the reflected sunlight and
light summer clothing: lent attractive
ness to the scene. The enthusiasm of
the thousands who sat throughout the
rendering of the long programme was
unbounded.

John Auseon, who is located at Twen

yt "Business has been exceedingly good
during the last week. I have just closed
several fair sales, and property generally
in this vicinity is bringing : fair prices.
\u25a0Our renting department has been unusu
ally busy of late, and, as a rule, the de

has been greater than the supply. The
general outlook is at present more than
usually good." \u0084,
J. E. Edmester, also of Twenty-third
avenue, said: â¢
"There is a steady demand for houses
for rent, and very few are to be had at
present. The prices of property of all

lately closed some very fair sales. At
the present time building operations are
very brisk, and I consider the general
outlook better than ever before."

OAKLAND, May 21.â As was predicted
by the local real estate dealers, at the
opening of the present year, the spring
and early summer sales of residence
property in Oakland and'its suburbs have
so far greatly exceeded those 4>f the same
months in any previous year in the his
tory of the city. Mary of the recent
sales of residence property have been
made to newcomers. In a number of in
stances where, the property purchased
has been unimproved contracts have been
let for the erection of handsome resi
dences.
Alameda real estate men generally ex
press the opinion that the end of the
present year will witness a total of busi
ness greater than any ever before known
In Oakland and the surrounding towns.
William J. Laymance of the Laymance
Real Estate Company said:
"I feel no hesitation in saying that any
person who uses otdinary discretion in
the purchase of real estate in Oakland,
or for that matter anywhere in Alameda
County, will not only be insured against
loss or depreciation in value! but will be
reasonably sure of being able in the near
future .to dispose of the property at a
handsome profit. From, my experience in
the last two years I am satisfied/that
the value of Alameda County real estate
will advance much more rapidly than -it
has up to the present time." . -.
Williams & Parsons report a large
number of good sales in the last two
weeks, with prospects of a splendid rec
ord for the coming summer.

Dr. Miles' Restorative Ner-

feeds the nerves, produces nerve
force, and restores vitality.

The aeroplane Santa Clara was the
first sent up. A great cheer arose as the
bird-like structure was hauled - upward,
but when it had reached 150 feet the rope
attaching it to the balloon parted. The
aeroplane at once started downward,
but aeronaut E>aniel Maloney did not
lose his head and at once began steering
it in a circle. 'It answered his tugs at the
gear, circled a few times -and; finally
landed lightly on the racecourse about
100 yards from where it started. Maloney
skillfully dodged a crowd of spectators.
This illustrated the merits -of the ma
chine better than any test heretofore
made, and showed that it was safe in a
short flight. If It had been a parachute
Maloney would have been killed, as ' it
could not have opened in that distance.
Professor Montgomery announced that
another exhibition 'would be given. A
balloon was secured and the aeroplane
Santa Clara II was prepared for flight.
It was 7 o'clock . when Maloney started
with the second aeroplane. About 1000
feet up it could be seen that two wind
lass ropes connected with the balloon had
not been' dropped and had become tan
gled in the aeroplane. Maloney was un
able to free the machine. He. bad. to be
content to stay with the balloon and was
carried two miles south of the city. He
alighted with the balloon In a grain field.
The aeronaut was' uninjured. ,
The 3500 people present -in. Agricultural
Park were satisfied,, however. Fully!: as
many more spectators were outside the
fence, and thousands, viewed 'the exhibi
tion from their homes. There was a de
lay of nearly three hours, and It . was 5
o'clock when the big hot air balloon
which was to raise the aeroplane was
filled for the exhibition. This is the big
gest balloon of the kind ever construct
ed, being seventy feet high and 150 feet
in circumference.
SAX JOSE, May 2Lâ Two sensational
flights .of Professor Montgomery's aero
planes were given this afternoon at Agri
cultural Park. Unkind fate hovered over
the exhibitions, for in the first attempt
the aeroplane broke-loose from the bal
loon at a height of 150 feet and dropped
quickly to the ground;. and in the second
flight the ropes became tangled and the
aeroplane could not be loosened and was
carried two miles below the city. The
aeronaut came back to earth when the
balloon had cooled sufficiently to allow
him to descend.

THIS is an age of hustle. 1 Here at a
glance one may see how some of the
recent most remarkable feats in the
art of hustling compared one with another
in respect to j the j time occupied :in com
pleting them, the black column iv each
instance being drawn in length in pro
portion to the time taken. Some of the
feats recorded were "performed by a
single brain, others were the acts of
groups of men. . Some represent instances
o5 unpremeditated bustle, . while upon
others long and. earnest thought had pro
vided beforehand > for anyâ contingency
likely to occur. In the rush for the record,
Miys a writer in the Detroit Tribune.
â¢In the engineering world locomotive
building was once very popular ; among
hustlers, until the Great Eastern Railway
turned out an engine in nine hours forty
seven minutes in 1891 arid set up a seem
ingly unapproachable record. Now the
most popular phase of hustling has taken
the form of a Titanic game of . "bridge"
that culminated, in a structure, 906 feet
long, crossing, the Raritan River and the
Delaware and. Raritan Canal,. being moved
by, the Pennsylvania Railroad , Company
on to new abutments in me brief time
of eight and a half minutes. 1 The actual
time taken for the ; removal ' of . the struc
ture, weighing 2400 tonsr through fourteen
feet six inches, was. 193 seconds, the bal
ance of the time being occupied in re
moving the bolts and making the discon
nections'arid in making fresh connections
at the ends when the bridge was in its
new position. . .
REMOAING BRIDGES.
- In England a few days ago the Midland
Railway removed a bridge near Attercliffe
Road Station. Shefifleld, a,nd substituted a
steel structure, in five hours ten minutes;
while a/420-ton bridge on* the London,
Tilbury and Southend line. In the neigh
borhood of Bow, was lasl summer placed
in position between 12:40 on the Saturday,
night and 10:30 on the Sunday morning,
notwithstanding the fact that the old
bridge was not got out of the way before
4 a. m. and the new bridge had to travel
thirty feet. The West London Extension
Railway Company . succeeded in *, moving
a.v : old fifty-ton bridge in ;< the . neighbor
hood of Battersea Station In 1902 and sub
stituting a new structure of double the
weight ; in forty-two minutes.
Expeditious "as these feats, undoubtedly
were they can .. scarcely. ,- be said -to have
eclipsed those of - the - world's two cham
pion butchers. . In one instance a Ballarat
butcher backed himself jln 1900 for | to
place chops on -a gridiron in ten minutes
from the time he took; the sheep in hand
to shear,; kill and dress iL He .won.
American meat dressers hearing of this
.Englishman's fame, journeyed across the
Atlantic with the idea ' of, ' flgurately
speaking, wiping the floor with the Brit
ish champion. ' The English representa
tive in this line of hustling is Stanley
Warth, 'a' foreman butcher of Ipswich,
who in .' 1900 performed the , remarkable
feat of dressing \ a bullook and a sheep
and ' running a * mile," all iwithin 'l half \u25a0\u25a0 an

clad in the dernier cri of fashionable
mourning. But- the most popular form of
hustling, so far as tailors are concerned,
is over the "sheep -to coat" course. This
feat in the art of hurrying received a
great impetus in 1811, when Sir John
Throgrmorton made a bet of $5000 that at
8 o'clock on a certain evening he would
sit down to dine in a suit, the wool of
Which had been shorn the same morning.
It is now a matter of history that the
various processes were. completed in thir
teen hours and "that Sir.. John , won the
wager with an hour to spare. 1 That mod
ern methods have improved upon those
of almost a hundred years ago was made
clear a few years ago when Americans
accomplished. the same feat in the mar
velous time of. six hours and four min
utes, of which period six tailors were
engaged for two | and a half hours in
completing the tailoring portion of the
work. ; ' " V ' : '\u25a0 :

WORLD WITNESSES REMARKABLE
FEATS IN THE-ART OF HUSTLING
TRADE STILL EXPANDING.
Some of the Wonderful Achievements of Recent Years.
The same wet and backward weather which has caused the
damage to the wheat crop in the Southwest and some sections of the
West has been interfering with the jobbing and retail trade and cut
ting down the regular movement of staple goods to the detriment of
general business.- But the diminution in the distributive movement
is not serious, if we may judge by the clearing-house returns, which
show a gain for the past week of 31.9 per cent over the correspond
ing week last year, with every one of the forty most important citifes
and towns on the list exhibiting an increase except Buffalo, whicli
shows a small loss of 8 per cent. The- aggregate clearings were
$2,671,700,000, a good showing.
These returns are confirmatory of the statement frequently made
of late that the general business of the country is not contracting but
steadily expanding, not only naturally in consequence of the normal
increase in population, but actually beyond it, snowing that large as
production is, it has not yet overtaken consumption. This current
era of trade activity is surprising; It has continued now some seven
years, and shows no signs of ceasing: It must of course come to an
end some time, and nobody thought that it would last as long as it
has, but it is still with us, as bright and lively as ever, and, what is
especially gratifying, without fever or undue speculative activity.
The staples as a rule are firm. Lumber,, hides and leather, wool
and woolen goods, cotton, the different cereals, most groceries, foot
wear and general clothing, dairy products, iron structural material,
car-building, land-purchasing, house construction, , farming imple
ments, railway freight and passenger traffic, foreign exports and im 1
ports, and, in fact, almost everything readily perceptible to the'in
quiring eye, are more than normally active, while prices are gener
ally higher than the normal of recent years. All this is simply the
exhibit of a prosperity which is apparently endless, though, as just
observed, it must end some- time or other. The volume of trade is
well illustrated by the recent statement in the woolen trade, which
says that all the mills of the American Woolen Company have their
entire product sold at prices which assure. the company, the largest
business and profits in its history. And this is only one of many
similar statements which are appearing every few days. ./-;;:
mJ~ The outlook on this coast continues bright, as usual. Our crop
prospects, while not as brilliant as two months ago, are still excellent,
our local and export trade are active, our banks report more funds
than they really care to have on hand, our building is on a large and
apparently unending scale, our labor is fully employed," with wages
far above the normal of recent years, a stream of home-seekers is
pouring into the State from the West, and our merchants, wholesale
and retail, are reporting business good and collections at least up
to the average, with no more than the usual run of failures. IWhat
better commercial conditions could we ask ? ...
\u25a0-\u25a0 _ â¢Â«â¢â¢â¢ * " - Â«\u25a0\u25a0-"Â«"'"*"\u25a0
THE markets of the country exhibited no pronounced changes
last week, except in Wall street stocks, which were very un
settled, with uncertain and irregular quotations. The general
tone of stocks was weak, owing to the crop damage reports from
the Southwestern wheat sections, the Chicago strike and the less
favorable reports from the iron and steel industry. This latter was
the prime factor in weakening prices, and during the middle and
latter part of the week a heavy selling movement, in steel shares ren
dered the whole stock list weak and carried both railroads and indus
trials down with it. This was in the face of good reports from the
textile mills and the continued increase in railroad earnings, those
thus far in May showing a gain of 8 per cent over May, 1904. . .
- It seems rather singular that one industrial line should affect all
the other industrials when the showing of the latter is excellent as
a rule, but such is the case at present, and it shows what an influence
the great steel corporation has upon the American people and the
American speculative markets. It was only about a week or ten
days ago that the president of the corporation went to Europe with
the smiling remark that the corporation was never in such fine condi
tion as at present, but before he had hardly arrived across the ocean
unfavorable reports regarding the outlook in this line sprang up and
caused general selling, not only of the steel shares, but of everything
else on the list. But, as has been the gratifying rule for some time,
the money market was not disturbed by this heavy liquidation, and
funds continued very plentiful, with the usual low rates of interest.
The current decline in stocks is thus aptly stated by* a well
known Wall-street brokerage house: "Crop damage reports and con
tinued heavy selling of steels, and new low records, caused heavy sell
ing. We are getting our first crop scares, and it is likely these fac
tory will be well discounted now and the usual May declines in the
securities market will be witnessed. Sensational reports about rain
in the West and stories of shutting down mills and plants of steel
corporations are coming thick and fast, but you can rest assured
they are not true. The steel trade is getting a* natural setback or
dullness from the recent rapid pace of six months, but orders on hand
will be forthcoming for a long period to keep all the mills busy, and a
week of cloudless weather will make crops finer than ever. . It seems
as if all these unfavorable features are.being crowded into this week."
SCHOOL GARDENS.
VACANT lot cultivation as a philanthropic scheme has branched
out into educational forms, and the school garden for children
is one of the lines in which the famous Pihgree plan .is making
practical development. The system as worked in Philadelphia has
achieved a notable success and may instill into many of the children
who get the advantage of it such a taste for the industry and keen
ness to acquire skill in gardening as will give them a~ profitable
trade in later years.
Seven gardens were cultivated and a thousand children had
instruction in the art of producing vegetables and flowers. To pro
mote this good work three institutions co-operatedâ the Vacant Lots
Cultivation Association; the Public Education Association and the
Board of Public Education. The Civic Club of Philadelphia also
conducted one of the gardens. The report of , the Vacant Lots Asso
ciation says that the children's gardens ; 'vvere successful in every
sense of the word, and were a joy and benefit to thousands of chil
dren and their parents." A remarkable feature of the happy success
of it all is that although at the beginning thqre, was much fear en
tertained for the plan because.it was thought th.c. children, mis
chievous and bad, might pluck, stealor injure the product growing
in the unguarded and openly exposed lots, not a flower or vegetable
was touched until the teachers said they were ready for use. There
were not nearly enough gardens to supply all~the children who
wanted them, but those who had none refrained from touching the
flowers of the fortunate ones who had little plots to tend.
The educational benefit that is_ coming to adults from the reg
ular philanthropic work of the Vacant Lots Association is; some
thing of which Philadelphia may be proud. Perhaps it may be deemed
more important than the direct supportit gives by supplying work
to the unemployed. A large percentage of those who get. the train
ing of self-help in these gardens develop into capable gardeners
who soon go out to operate places on their own account. Thus^the
system becomes a training school for workers in that greatest of all
industries, agriculture.
When a girl tells a young man that she doesn't eat any more than a bird
he should remember before inviting her to lunch that an ostrich is a bird.--

tion Is in the mines of the Ural Moun
tains. Russia. It is also found In
Brazil and Colombia, South America:
in Santo Domingo, in Canada. In the gold
mines of the island ot Borneo, also in
California and Oregon. The metal ia
used in the manufacture of apparatus
for laboratory use, spatulas, crucibles,

the action of acids rendering It of pe
culiar value for these purposes. As it
is not acted jpon by the atmosphere
and Is of very high melting power it ia
in great demand. It is also used in
the photographic process of printing.
It is the most infusible of all metals,
melting only before the oxyhydrosren

with the stipulation that the congrega

present temple for two years, the time
which It will take to erect the new edi
fice. .
At the meeting yesterday the old board
of directors was re-elected and it was
resolved to reincorporate." This will give
a clear way to allow of the sale of the
temple and the adjoining: lot.

the discovery was made that the legal
life of the corporation had expired and
consequently the sale had to 'be post
poned. . .

But, seriously, such an organization
has it In its power to wield a large in
fluence. It s:a>- foster an interest in the
history of their' forefathers and the
country in which they settled. It may
create an interest In preserving historic
relics and records and legends and
thereby lay the foundation for an in
telligent patriotism.
But there is this to fear in such a
body â that patriotism be dwarfed into
provincialism; that reasonable pride of
ancestry â over which we exercise no
control and therefore for which we de
serve no credit â become a phase of
snobbery, and therefore a slap in the
face of the sacredest things America
stands for.
flf you are and can prove it you are
idden to a reception given at the St.
Francis this alternoon by Mrs. Henry
â¢S. Coe of New York, who is touring the
country with the Tsayes and Incidental
ly rounding up the natives of New Eng
land that they may form themselves
into an organization. These are essen
tially the days of organization for
women. They are gathered together
under banners of religion, dries, cards,
cultcre, lineage and a dozen and one
other alleged causes.
Under the lineage classification there
are already a bevy of bodies, notably
;bÂ© Daughters of the American Revolu
tion, the Colonial Dames and. the
Daughters of the Confederacy, each
\u25a0with their distinctive features and each
of the first organizations preying upon
the, rolls of the other. And as a result
some naughty things are said and done
in both camps.
But that is neither here nor there In
the matter of the new organization,
namely, the Society of New England
Women. These good ladies may be of
the peaceable sort, and if they keep
their minds in as good order as they
do their homes, sweet peace will reign
in the new society â and here's to It â
likewise to the handsome projenltor,
Mrs. Coe. And may their family Jars
be of a type to make a good newspaper
story. Amen!

\AinAE.G Hylan<i.u is . not without
;. â¢ .- : ....... â¢ . : reason ?
If her system is in a deranged condi-
tion, or she is predisposed to apoplexy
or congestion of any organ, it is at this
time likely to become active and, with
a host of nervous irritations, make life
a burden.
At this time, also, cancers and tumors
are more liable to begin "their destruc-
tive work. Such warning symptoms as
a sense of suffocation, hot flashes, diz-
ziness, headache, dread of impending
evil, sounds in the ears, timidity,. pal-
pitation' of -the heart, sparks before
the eyes, irregularities, constipation,
variable appetite, weakness and inqui-
etude, are promptly heeded, by intelli-
gent women who are approaching the
period of -life when A woman's great
change may be expected.
L>dia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Com-
pound is the, world's greatest remedy
for women at this trying period, and
may be relied upon to overcome all dis-
tressing symptoms and carry them
safely through to a healthy and happy
old age.
Â§ Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Com-
pound invigorates and strengthens the
female 'organism, and builds up the
weakened nerrous system as no other
medicine can. " :. .
Mrs A. E. G. Hylaua, of Chester-
town, Md.| in a letter to Mrs. Pink-
ham, says:
Dear Mrs. Pinkhara:â
"I had been suffering with falling of the
womb for years end was passing through the
chance of fif e. . My \u25a0womb was badly swollen.
I hadn good deal of sorenes?, dizzy spells,
headaches, and was very . ntjrvous. I wroto
you" for advice and commenced treatment
with Lydia E. Pinkhana's Vegetable Com-
pound as you directed, and I am happy to say
that all those distressing symptom* left me,
and I have passed safely through the change
of life a well woman."
.'\u25a0; For special aidviee regarding this im-
portnnt period wbmen are invited to
write to Mrsl Pinkham . for advice. It
is free and always helpful.

day. Tbe first game was a beauty, with
plenty of cS .;irp fielding. Roscoe Miller
earned irsMtkets because he was steady
in the pinches and the fielding -behind
him was fast. Oscar: Graham was hit
hard, but his support saved him, four
men being thrown out at the plate.
Kemmer made three two-baggers. He
scored one run and drove in -the -other
two. Oakland was dangerous up to: the

Portland run in the fifth Inning, when
w*th two down and two on the paths

thus forcing a run through. Jones -was
getting his right along and the six runs
were the result of twelve good bingles.

LOS ; AXGELES; May 21â Gray arid
Keefe fought out one of the greatest
pitchers', battles' to-day ever seen on
the home diamond. For seventeen In
nings they contested every inch of the
way, with, neither having; a perceptible
advantage until the final inning.. Gray
held ..Tacoma down, to .eight [ hits Tana
Keefe allowed but one more. Both
teams scored a' single run fn the sixth
inning and there, was nothing more in
the run-getting line until the seven
teenth.
In .the first half of the sixth Doyle,
for Tacoma, hit to Smith at third, who
threw -wild, Doyle going to second.
Sheehan fcacriSced him to third and
McLaughlin hit to second and was out
at first, Doyle scoring on the play. In
Los Anereles' half of the same inning
Flood singled and Smith doubled along
the third-base line, Flood.
The next ten innings were fought
out by the pitchers', the batters for
both sides jgoingr out in one-two-three
order in nearly every inning. Neither
side was in danger of scoring until the
final half of the seventeenth. In' this
Inning, after the Tacomaa bad been re
tired in their half, Dillon led off for
Los Angeles with a clean single to
right. Cravath followed with a single
to left, Dillon advancing to third and
scoriug when Toman lined the ball out
to extreme left. Four thousand people
saw. the game! Aside from tfte great
work of both pitchers there was -little
of the spectacular in the game. Ber
nard carried off the fielding honors,
making two brilliant catches -in center
field. Tacoma made but one error in
the long firame, Los Angeles being
charged with three, but one of 'â¢ which,
however, having any bearing on the re
sult of the game. Score: v

Garvin winged 'on over so fast and so
accurately that every one of Uncle's tribe
v.as on his staff. Xot a man hit safely
tiil the seventh, when Hildebrand beat
out a bunt. The Giants played a good
game in the Held behind Garvin. while
McLean pegged out every man who tried
to gei away with a steal. In this respect
"Wilson was wrong, getting only one out
of four. The score:
McLran poked out a hit and French
sacrificed in the second. When Runkle
placed one into right Wheeler deflected
it ju.^t enough to prevent Spencer throw
ing- the big catcher oat. at the plate.
Garvin i>oppod up a fly and r.'ealon drop
ped it. He also booted one from the bat
of Atz and while the rough work \u25a0seas
beins performed Runkle came through/
The Giants did not get any more rans,
though it was their own fault, for, they
tureiy had enough chances. Every inning
or so some Seal would boot one around,
but thf-y all perished orvthe sacks. Wil
liams continued to hand out the best he
had and besides he scored the Seals'
lone one in the eighth when he beat a
scratchy one to Garvin and rounded every
turn after the sylph like Texan had
hfaveil the leather into the right field

Only one tournament tennis "match
.was . played . on . the tennis ' courts | yester
day, but it was one of the closest and
most interesting seen in months. It was
the finals of the handicap doubles tour
nameat commenced at the California" Club
a week dgo. The contestants were Carl
Gardner and Melville Long and Harry
Rolfcand George Busch. They met on
even terms and after five close sets bad
betn played -the* erdlct went to. Gardner
and Long by a narrow margin. The scoro
was 5-7. 6-4. 2-6, 7-5. 7-5. .
*' All four played good tennis and the oat
come was in doubt until the last point
hau been played. Stamina undoubtedly
won the raa.ch for Gardner and Long.
Rolf e and Busch play themselves .' out .
out after about three sets, but they held.'
gamely on yesterday and almost won out.'-
Long and Gardner can play all day with-
out tiring and to this fact they Owe th,eir
victory. V. â¢ â¢ - - " '"--â¢
.Gardner was the star of the four, doing -
some brilliant playing- both at the net aad
in the back CQur!.,v.YoujJs Long .was
rather erratic, but gave his partner good
support: | Rolf e was ' the mainstay o* too
losing team,' As .usual he was as steady*
as a clock, but waa not sufficiently* ag
gressive.' 'Busch. played In streaks ? i at :
times being brilliant and? at other tunes
playing .â rather poorly. __ He .won many,
points on his short crosscourt drives." HU
service was by tar 'the best ot' the f our.
This, is Long- and Gardner's first victory \u25a0
in a tournament for these cups, Rolfa
and Schmidt won the first touxoamea&
for the trophies. .
Few practice matches ,were played on
the club courts. Carl Gardner and Har
old Gabriel played tiro fast seta In
singles. Gaidner was too strong for his
clever young* opponent and took both seta.
The score was 6-2, 7-3.
Dr. Noble caused quize a. surprise by
winning four straight seta from William
Murphy. The latter ranks at the top of
the fourth class and seldom loses to any
one in that section. The doctor was at
his best and won by a score of 3-2. 6-4,
6-4. 7-5.
W. G. Knowlton and Grant Smith met
in a handicap match. Smith allowed his
opponent odds. of 30 and after losing two
love sets pulled out the next two. Tha
score was 6-0^ 9-0. 2-6, 6-8.
H. Lund made an excellent ' showing
against H. E. Punr.ett. The latter is a
class* above his* opponent, bat -expert-*
enced some difficulty in beating him. The
score was 6-3, 6-3, 7-5.

'shift to Gravesend track, ' where *on
Thursday ; will be , - decided the $20,000
Brooklyn handicap, the. first really great
race of the year because of - the I fact of
its distance and of so many good horses
being engaged. There are, however, some
interesting | events still to : be decided at
Belmont v Park, one of which, the Thirty
ninth Belmont, should be a memorable
race. The fortunate owner of the winner
will become the . possessor of a piece of
gold plate valued at JlOOO in addition to
about $17,000 in money. Hence it is the
most valuable purse of the year up to
date."! / ;. \u25a0 ;.".:.. ;,

Dr. Oliver ;w. Stewart of Chicago,
who has. been in this State for the last
month lecturing under the, auspices of
the California Prohibition Committee,
addressed an enthusiastic meeting; last
night at the Grace Methodist Episcopal
Church on "What.; Is .the Right-Atti
tude for the. Government to Take
Toward Saloons?" Dr. Stewart, de
livered lectures before three audiences
yesterday. After, arriving in Berkeley
in the morning from Uklah, he" gave an
address there and in the afternoon ;he
addressed any audience In Alameda,
finally concluding at Grace Church. â¢
Mr. Stewart took up the question' of â¢
abolishing the saloons> He believed, the
Government should no "more, tolerate
them than it would tolerate a J ,thJef or
any other offender. He declared that
the Government could not, remedy the
evil by thefjevying of heavy licenses. This,
he said," was, nothing" more thanrecelv
lng.a bribe, to .allow the: people to do
what is wrong because they pay for it.
The only way to abolish the saloons, he
said, is for the Government to wipe out
distilleries "and prohibit the manufac
ture of liquors and intoxicants.
Dr. Oliver S. Stewart Asserts Uncle
Sam Should . Protect Citizens '
From Evils o*. Intoxicants.
SAYS .GOVERNMENT SHOULD
WIPE OUT DISTILLERIES
There 'has been some criticism .because
of the fact that the police at the Hall of
Justice- were not notified until over two
hours after the cracksman was seen at
work, although the; station is but two
blocks away and telephones could be had
at any hand. The burglar alarm system
with which Tthe office is equipped will
probably receive a knockout blow at the
hands of Postmaster Fisk when he makes
hip reoort . to the Government, on the
matter. When. the alarm was set off on
the vault In the cashier's room by the
postmasterias soon as he arrived at the
office the .'signal was ; received at the
alarm station. No effort, however, was
made to hasten I men to the scene. , The
excuse of the night manager is to the
effect that it was believed that the signal
was the result of a "break'*. and that on
the s occasion of an earthquake many
alarms come in. but. all are disregarded.
When the \ alarm : people were informed
that the place had been . robbed * they
seemed to awaken from their condition of
tranquillity .and ' about : Z . o-clock â¢ in the
morning two of their agents hastened
to the ' nostoffice. .
The stamps that were stolen, accord
ing to the explanation of the stamp clerk,
were left out of the safe for the.purpose
of supplying, outside stations on early
morning calls. This,' Stoweir explains,
has been the custom on Saturday nights,
as the office does not, open until noon on
Sundays.
The safe "crackers undoubtedly entered
through the'window on the- Battery-street

These nails were" rtmoved and in this
circumstance is founded the theory of

Motorman Whaley did -not see Ritchie
until the train was within 150 feet of the
crossing.: He threw - on- the emergency
brake! sounded the whistle- and: the bell,
but It was too late, to, avert the fatality.
Although the train, was composed of-s^v
eiv heavily: laden ' coaches^ going \u25a0 about
forty 'miles an' hour on a down 'grade, he
stopped thetrain -within- its; own length.

yesterday by a 'North -Shore electric train
at the road-crossing | half; ay mile â¢ north

along the road in a buggy.:
On arriving in Honolulu Vlda will 'have
completely encircled the globe in pursuit
or' the fugitive, whom he finally captured
in London. Seven months j ago ' Kapea,
who was a clerk in the employ of the
Hawaiian Trust and Investment Com
pany of Honolulu,' was suspected of steal
ing, and while an in\%3i:gatidn of his
accounts was in ' progress he secreted
himself aboard a Pacific Mail, steamer
and escaped to the Orient. Thither he
v/as traced, but by the time Deputy Vida
reached there Kapea . had hurried off' to
another couhtry'and so the chase con
tinued until the capture S in : London. . In
Tokio it, was found that Ka pea 'had been
spending, money in ; a lavisti manner aiid
then he went to "Canton and : later to
Bombay. . .. .
From Bombay the fugitive slowly, made
his way to Naples, by way of the Suez
Canal, and from there he drifted to Paris,
where after, several weeks' enjoyment
on the money he had stolen he went to
London. AH .this time Deputy Sheriff
Vida, confident that he would eventually
land his man, v was rapidly creeping up
on Kapea's .trail. But in London the
officer lost the .trail, and finally started
back to '. this . country. Immediately on
his arrival in .New York the Scotland
Yard" men of London notified. the authori
ties in Honolulu that Kapea . had.' been
apprehended. Securing requisition' papers
in Washlncton, Vida returned to Lon
don and took his quarry in" charge.;
. While awaiting the arrival in London
of Vida, Kapea, who had been detained
in . the Brixton Prison, - expressed ajj de
sire to return to Honolulu and gladly wel
comed the coming of the Depufy. Sheriff.
The latter stated last nigat that he had
had no trouble with Kapea during their
journey from . London and was satisfied
that his prisoner would make no attempt
to escape before the trip over the Pacific
Ocean is completed. . Kapea refuses to
talk of his troubles, but his captor said
that the Honolulu, Trust Company reckons
that It is out nearly $20,000 by peculations
and carelessness of the unfalthf ul , clerk.
An apartment ,ln the Occidental Ho
tel has been /converted Into a temporary
prison and In custody there, awaiting
the I departure', of "the next Hawaiian
nt earner, Is Henry K. Kapea, who Is un
der Indictment In Honolulu for, the theft
of several thousand dollars' worth of
territorial bonds. The prisoner,. who Is
about 26 yearn of age and of gentle
manly appearance, was brought to San
Francisco yesterday by \ Deputy Sheriff
Henry C. Vlda of Honolulu, who regis
tered hiniself . and then quietly j smuff-
Bled Knpea upstairs, where they trill
be quartered until they, can leave for
the Islands. By his \u25a0\u25a0' drastic methods',
the deputy hopes to, avert complications
that might arise from habeas : corpus
