raised" a direct: issue, of f act. Delcaase a t
once , suggested an inquiry to establish
.the facts through an International com

offering the fsuggestion simultaneously
to ' both 'governments, through - Embas
aador Cambon to Foreign' Minister
ansdowne and " through Secretary Bou
tieron. In Embassador Bompard's ab
sence, to Count Lamsdorff. ,
The Idea â¢ found - Instant ' favor, both
here and in London, and on Thursday
night . the -Russian and British proposi
tions. * Identical ; in effect, actually
crossed ' each other ' on - the way - to the
respective .' capitals. There -, was. how
ever, V this difference between" them:
Lord. Lansdowne's' instructions to Em
bassador Hardingre authorized him to
submit the proposition on, behalf of the
British Government"; whereas Count
Lamsdorff '3 instructions were tentative
and rather in the nature of a feeler, as
Count Lamsdorff, although he knew that
the Emperor was favorable to the plan,
had not yet secured the absolute con
sent . of his 5 Majesty, to whom "he ar
ranged to submit the matter finally on
Friday afternoon. .' .. '
'-.In the meantime, en Friday morning,
the British proposition duly reached the
Foreign Minister at Tsarkoe-Selo. and
on Friday afternoon the Emperor gave
his hearty approval. , .
.'The- -British proposition, . presented
early in the day,' remained unanswered.
Exactly. what transpired in London when
Embassador ; Benckendorff presented
the Russian proposition in the name of
Emperor Nicholas is not known, except
that Foreign Minister Lansdowne did not
insist upon. the question of precedence,
appreciating- doubtless that Russia, be
ins figuratively the offending party,
had! the better rt;ht to offer to submit
the â¢determination of the ' facts â¢ to ; an

CINCINNATI, Oct 30. â The bul
letin Issued by the physicians attend
ing Archbishop Elder at 10 o'clock
showed the following: Temperature,
102; pulse, 125; respiration, 34. Since
he was prostrated by the grip last Fri
day, he has rallied at different times,
but these rallies were only temporary
and he has been gradually growing
weaker, so that at midnight he was
reported as "Just alive." He has been
very weak ever since he fell from his
chair on Friday and his physicians
have never been hopeful of recovery.
NEW HAVEN, Conn.,. Oct. 30.â It; is
definitely .'announced that the New
York,, New Haven and Hartford Com
pany, at a meeting of its directors last
Wednesday, all but two being present,
voted with unanimity, to accept an op
tion offered by Kuhn,*-Loeb & Co. on a
majority of the Ontario and Western
stock. The price is $45 a share, ex-div
idend, and all the arrangements for the
temporary financing, . extending over
some months, have been made. *
Tb/s question of a lease of the Ontario
and Western came up, but It was found
that this plan required the assent of
the New York Central and it was drop
ped. It is probable, however/that the
New York. New Haven and Hartford
Railroad Company will make provision
for the minority holders of Â¦ the Ontario
and Western Company on a. basis . rep
resenting about $40 a share of stock.
By the new purchase the New' Haven
Company . acquires about :â¢ 500 miles of
road, of which some 150 miles west of
Cornwall, > N. T., Is in progress of dou
ble-tracking. .
The most important /feature" of the
deal is the fact that for the first time rn
New England Â¦ railroad history i It i gives
a great New. England carrying corpor
ation access -to the coal' mines on the
one . hand and to the ; Great â¢ Lakes tjn

the ' Haverly Minstrels opening, and
the setting, was that kind. It was
enough to make ' any one's = mouth
water. Naturally. It was the right
sideâ the Inside â -of . a cooh crisp,
pinky, pulpy; giant watermelon, a sort
of darky Dantes* dream of paradise.
The minstrels sat ;- inside, sat . on
scooped-out melons, on tiers of rosy
melon . flesh.-. and- the r effect. darKily
considered, ' was deliriously luscious.

Van's turn he told one of the "same
stories as .; last year,', a long one, â¢ a

WAR IS XO HINDRANCE.
The annual 'conference of the Interparlla-'
mentary Union was- held this year^ at St.
Louis. In appropriate connection with the
World'B Fair., It* deliberations were ; marked
by the tame nobls devotion .to 'the cause, of
peace and to the welfare of 'humanity which
had Inspired ' its former . meetings. . By f the
unanimous vote of the delegates,, Active or re
tired members of 'the American . Congress and
of every Parliament In Europe with 'two excep-,
tions. the following resolution was adopted :â¢
"Whereas, Enlightened public Â¦ opinion arid
modern civilization- alike demand that differ
ences between nations should be adjudicated
and settled In the same manner as differences
between individuals, are adjudicated, namely,
by the arbitrament of courts in accordance
with recognised principles -of law. this confer-,
ence requests the several Governments of the
world to send delegates to an international con
ference to be held at a time and - place to be
agreed* upon by them for the purpose or con
sidering the questions for the consideration of
which The Hague conference expressed a wish
that a future conference be called; the nego
tiations of arbitration treaties between the na
tions represented at the conference to be con
vened: the advisability, of the establishment of
an International congress to convene period
ically for the discussion of international ques
tions; and the conference respectful!- and cor
dially requests -the President of the United
States to invite all the nations to send repre
sentatives to such a conference."
On September 24 ultimo these resolutions
were presented to the President by a ; numer-i
ous deputation of .the . Interparliamentary
Union. The President accepted the charge of
fered to him, feeling it to' be most appropriate
that the. executive of the nation which 'had
welcomed the conference to its hospitality
should give voice to Its Impressive utterances
In a cause which the: American .> Government'
and Â¦ people hold : dear. He announced that '. he !
would at Â¦ an early Â¦ date Invite i the other * na-
tlons, parties to The ; Hague convention. ) to re- !
assemble ' with a .View Â¦ to - pushing i forward to-'
ward completion the Â¦ work already begun. Â¦ at

the first conference had left unsettled with . the
express provision that there should be a sec-*

DEPAKTMENTOF STATE, WASHING
TON, p. C., Oct. 21, 1904.â To the Representa
tive*, of. the United States Accredited to the
Governments Signatories to the .; Acts ot * The
Hague Conference, 11*04 â Sirs : The peace
conterence which assembled at The Hague. on
May IS. 18Â»Â», marked an epoch in the history
of nations. Called by his Majesty the Emper
or of Russia, to discuss the problems of the
maintenance of general peace, the regulation
of the operations of war, and the lessening of
the Â¦ burdens which preparedness' for eventual
war entails upon modern ' peoples, its labors
resulted in the . acceptance . by the signatory
powers of the convention for the peaceful ad
justment of International differences * by arbi
tration - and for certain humane amendments
to the laws and customs of war by land and
sea. great work was thus accomplished . by
tnt conference, while other phases of the gen
eral subject were left to be. discussed by an
other conference in the near -future, such as
questions affecting the rights and duties of
neutrals, the Inviolability of private property 5
in naval warfare and the bombardment of
ports, towns and villages by a â¢ naval force. ;
Among the movements which prepared * tht
minds of Governments for an accord in the
direction of assured peace among men, a high
place may -fittingly be given to that. set on;
foot by -the Interparliamentary - Union. Â¦ From
its origin in the suggestions of a member of
the British House' of Commons, in 1&S8. it de-'
veloped until Us membership Included- large"
numbers of delegates from the Parliaments of
the principal nations, pledged to exert their,
influence â¢ toward the conclusion of treaties '. of
arbitration between : nations - and . toward the
accomplishment of peace. Â¦ Its annual - confer
ences have notably advanced the high-purpcjes
It eoueht to realize.- Not only .have-, many In
ternational treaties of arbitration been..con
cluded, but. In the conference held in Holland
in ilM>4, the memorable declaration in! favor of
4 .permanent court -or arbitration Was a, fore
runner of .the most Important- achievement or
the peace conference' of The Hague In" 1898.
: TO 'MOVEMENT.-'
WASHINGTON, Oct. 30.â In a circu
lar-note Secretary Hay has carried" out
the President's instructions; relative to
proposing a: second Hague : conference,'
The note not only contemplates the. reÂ«
assembling, of .The Hague conference
for the consideration - of \ questions spe-i"
cifically. mentioned by the original con
ference as. demanding further, attention;
such as the' rights : and duties",of,neu
trals, the inviolability of' private prop
erty, in naval .warfare ; and the bom
bardment of. ports by naval force, -but
goes further by practically indorsing
the project of a general system of _ ar
bitration treaties and' the establishment
of ah international congress to c meet
periodically in the interests of peace.'
The issuance of the call â¢ while the pres
ent war is In progress is justified by the
fact that the flrBt^HaguV;; conference
was called before our treaty of peace
with Spain was concluded. The text of
the note follows:
Invitation Practically ail

The Pickwicks won by default from
the Eagles on the ground Â¦ that the
latter club had not registered' Its rep
resentatives as amateurs. The Eagles
filled up their team with players on
ttie field and in the game that ensued
were beaten, 4 goals to 0, by the Pick
wicks. â¢
The team of the Oakland Hornets
includes some of the strongest associa
tion footballers in the State, but,
through a lack of club spirit, five of
these did not put in an appearance.
The absentees were: Duncan, " Taylor,
Chambers, R. Disher and T. * Disher.
Captain McKenzle was so disgruntled
that at first he refused to don his foot
ball togs and Williamson walked away
from his post of goalkeeper. Both
were persuaded to play and two of thÂ«
vacant places were filled by the ever
ready 'Edgar Pomeroy 'and McGregor.-
The game brought out some lively
play, bat," with only three men in the
forward line, the Hornets were out

The play was marked- by a good
deal of ill-feeling and fights were nar
rowly averted on several occasions.

PARIS, Oct. 30.â Premier Combes

storing now and conditions may im
prove there. The sale of some really
first-class wine by even a few handlers
will enhance the, reputation of Califor
nia - wines generally, but I tell you it
will be a long time before the prejudice
aroused by the unwise methods em
ployed . up to date can be overcome.
California cannot begin too soon the
efforts to redeem herself, and the man
who grows the grapes should take Just
as strong a part in it as the man who
handles the product."
Perhaps these remarks will not be
palatable to California wine men, but
there may be much truth in them. That
no wine is kept in the cellars in Califor
nia long enough to be, matured, how
ever, is too broad a statement, for. right
at this fair are. vintages from Califor
nia twenty- two years old. It is true*
that nearly all wines from the -Golden
State were "off" when tasted here, but
the same was true of the foreign wines
and lack . of cellar facilities and the
warm -weather were blamed.
Secretary of the Legation Hiokl has
been designated to meet the Prince : on
his arrival at San * Francisco, but it is
probable, in* view ; of ; the Minister's I ill
ness, that some one v else may i be desig
nated to that duty, leaving Hiokl in
charge of the legation.
Maybe the Eastern . producers are
correct in. their criticisms, maybe they
are not. If they can advance anything
worth knowing there is no harm in
the California vlneyardlst and dealer
hearing what it Is. Perhaps one of
the most representative Eastern- wine
men at the fair is A: J. High, ; repre
senting the Brotherhood Wine , Com
pany of New York City. He is a large
owner and' a director of this asso
ciation and has produced and handled
Eastern wines for many years. High
is a genial man, with no desire to
"knock" and evidently Is - sincere in
what he says. With the width of a
; continent between California and his
place of business he isn't afraid to
make criticism, either. Let the Cali
fornia producer listen: *
"California produces some good
wines, it is true," said High, "but we
are selling better ones in New York,
EXPERT GIVES OPINION.
CALL BUREAU, WORLD'S FAIR.
Oct. 30.â The average Callfornian. with
purpling grapes and wine casks as
familiar to him as the smile of- the
sun, comes naturally to believe that
his State is the only one in. the Union
in which the viticultural Industry can
be considered seriously. Perhaps he
is right, but that doesn't prevent the
-regions where men's ears curl up and
drop into the gutters about the glad
Yule tide like falling leaves, feeling
seme conceit about the vintages they
prpduce. They do feel it, too.
California would never be perturbed
by any conceit Eastern States might
have about their wines. She feels too
certain of her supremacy, in a viticult
ural way over all other portions of the
United States, but she has some les
sons to learn, perhaps, \ from Eastern
opinions. At least her grape-growers
and wine-handlers would be interested
in these opinions of Eastern wine men.
no matter how amusing some of them
may be; and they are not all merely
amusing; some of them contain criti
cism that. If true, should cause Cali
fornia wine men to give 'them thought.
Eastern producers actually believe they
put a better quality of wine on the mar
ket in many instances than does Cali
fornia. They generally admit that Cal
ifornia can produce the best of wines,
but say she is not making the best use
of the advantages nature has given her.
and that an uncurbed spirit of commer
cialism and a desire to get auick re
turns are retarding the advance of the
industry toward the highest standard
and giving profits to-day at the expense
of the future.
Unfortunately for California wines,
an impression prevails in the East that
they are all too "new." According to
Eastern producers this belief has a
good foundation. They say the Cali
fornia vintages are marketed too . soon
and that the best returns will never
be secured as long, as this is kept up.

In response to a telephone message
from the Japanese Consul at New York
this afternoon announcing the serious
condition of the Minister, Third Secre
tary of the Legation Hanira went to
New York to-night and will remain
â¢.vith the Minister.
There were many expressions of. re
gret in Washington over the news of
Takahira's illness. It is sincereljn
hoped that his recovery -may be hast
ened as Takahira is anxious to.partici
pate in the courtesies: which rare to; be
extended to Prince Fushlmi, the adopt
ed brother. . of : the Emperor whose ar
rival at San Francisco is scheduled for
the second week ; in November. First
WASHINGTON. Oct. 30.â Minister
Takahira, who was operated on in New
York to-day for appendicitis, went to
New York for the purpose of negotiat
ing for the purchase of a carriage for
the use. of the legation In this city.
His trip was intended to be very brief
and as soon as he had completed his
purchase, the Minister Intended to re
turn to Washington. The carriage
which has been in use by the legation
for same time was destroyed -by fire
in a livery stable In this city several
weeks aÂ«ro.
Uchidl, the Japanese Consul Gener
al at this port, speaking of Minister
Takahira's illness, said:
"After going to his hotel here Fri
day night Takahira complained of
pains in his side. Dr. Schrady was
summoned and immediately applied
remedies which afforded some relief.
"To-day, however. Dr. Schrady called
into consultation Drs. William Bull
and Francis Delafleld. They decided
that an operation was Imperative. Dr.
Bull performed the operation this aft
ernoon, assisted by Drs. Schrady and
Delafleld.
"The Minister rallied after the oper
ation and while his condition is far
from being good, it is favorable and
there is every reason to expect that he
will pull through.
"As soon as the serious nature of
his illness was made known the Lega
tion in Washington was informed and
through 't the home Government
Hanihara, the Third Secretary o" the
Legation in Washington, came -on to
this city and at once was present at
the operation. We shall remain with
the Minister during the night and if it
is necessary shall issue other bul
letins."
The Minister is 52 years old and has
a wife and three children in Toklo.
- RECOVERY PROBABLE.
RECOVERY PROBABLE.
"The patient was taken ill Saturday
morning with appendicitis. An opera
tion was decided upon by Doctors Bull,
Delafleld and Schrady. The operation
was made early in the afternoon, since
which time his condition has been
favorable, although he cannot be pro
nounced out of danger for two or three
days. At present the outlook Is favor
able."
NEW YORK, Oct. 1 30.â An operation
for appendicitis was performed on
Japanese Minister Kogoro Takahira In
a hotel in this city to-day. The case
is said to be a serious one and at
taches of the Japanese Legation at
Washington have been summoned to
the Minister's bedside.
Takahira arrived from Washington
Friday night and soon complained of
Illness, and asked that a physician be
sent for. The physician found the
Minister suffering much pain, but
remedies were administered, which
eased his suffering, and allowed him to
pass the remainder of the night com
fortably. Saturday, however, the Min
ister could retain no food and this,
with other symptoms, caused the
physician to believe that the case was
one of appendicitis, and to-day when
it was positively diagnosed as such, an
immediate operation was decided upon.
The operation was performed be
tween 3 and 4 o'clock by Dr. William
T. Bull, who issued the following bulle

"It takes five '. years to mature a
table wine and ten years to mature
any of the high grade wines, such as
port and sherry. There are few wines
In California held five years.
"The great trouble out there is the
desire to get the juice on the mar
ket and secure returns. There is not
sufficient cellar room in the State to
mature the product and the growers
of grapes haven't enough money to
hold their Juice until it is true wine.
Some of it ; is sold after six months,
most of It after eighteen months. You
can't possibly make a good table wine
under five years. .All fruit juices con
tain animalculae. Those in grape
juice change twice a year for five
years and then live forever. Then the
wine is matured and will stand hand
ling and shipping without the use of
deleterious adulterants.

dealers are building up a rotten struc
ture that will -tumble 'about their ears
some day. They are pursuing a policy
that is going. to do theni far more ul
timate damage than it is doing them
present good. It is probable that the
grower of the grape doesn't know just
how his future , Is being threatened.
At least he, is .not in a position to
protest. It takes a great deal of labor,
to work a vineyard and then perhaps
there is interest' on a, mortgage, for
many growers buy their land on -the
Installment , principle. Cooperage is
expensive, too. .They ' have to sell for
what they can, get: If they â¢ could
store their Juice for five years it would
be worth vastly more and each suc

wine man all unperf ected wine is
'juice.* When I. say that some of the
California wines are good, I mean
wines, not juice. Out there all the
table wines may be good, but they are
put on the market too young to stand
shipping. Used where it is made, a
new wine may taste well and be pure,
but sent on a Journey it gets 'oft*.' To
prevent this California dealers are
using salycilllc acid in wines, or rather
juices, they ship East, as a preserva
tive. This acid, harmless in small
quantities, is an accumulative poison
and consequently deleterious to people
who drink much of , the wine contain
ing it. The knowledge of the use of
this adulterant is greatly prejudicing
the Easterner against California wines.
The desire to obtain quick results is
casting a cloud over the splendid fu
ture California vintages should have.

ST. PETERSBURG. OcL 31, 2:25
a. m.â The military situation has not
yet developed anything of great im
portance, although the fight, at the
Buddhist Temple on October 27 ap
pears to have been a decidedly heavy
engagement. It probably indicates
that final moves on both sides are now
occurring, preparatory to another
long and serious battle.
Viceroy Alexieff Is now on the way
to St. Petersburg. The nature of his
reception is the food for much spec
ulation. Some of his friends still
cling to the idea that he will be made
Chancellor of the Empire, with his
residence in the Winter Palace, where,
it is said, a suite of apartments has
already been prepared for him. Â¦ On
the other hand, many declare that his
political career is practically over, and
-that his reception, in St. Petersburg,
while cordial, will mark the end of
his policital ascendancy. It is remem
bered that the Viceroyalty of the
Caucasus will be revived for his spe
cial benefit, which would constitute
, a complimentary and comfortable sort
of exile.
General Kuropatkin has telegraphed
as follows,' under date ofOctober 29:
' "I have received to-day no dispatch
reporting, encounters with the enemy.
During a cavalry reconnaissance yes
terday, ; after an infantry fight, sup
ported by, artillery, we occupied the
village of Chiantsanhenan. The enemy
j has retired from Sindiapu. On Octo
ber our chasseurs, with insignificant
losses, retained a village a kilometer
west, of Chentianpu against a violent
Japanese bombardment."
General Kuropatkin also records
other outpost affairs, including the
Russian reoccupation of the village of
Tynsin, a short distance south i of
Luidziatung, whence they had been
previously expelled by the Japanese,
who burned the village.

Sees 60,000 Plurality in New York
WASHINGTON, Oct. 80.â Elihu
Root of New York spent the evening
with President Roosevelt at the White
House talking over the political situa
tion. Hoot told the President that in
his Judgment there was no doubt of
I his election: that New York State
would give a plurality approximating
60,000 votes and if this prediction
proved to be correct the Republican
State ticket also would be successful.
A very material reduction in the
President's estimated plurality, Root
said, might endanger the State ticket.
. The former Secretary, in discussing
the campaign, which is now drawing
to a close, expressed his gratification
that, so far as the Republican Na
tional Committee was concerned it had
-been conducted amicably. There had
not been any discord, he said, and it
had not left any heart burnings. The
amount of money expended by the
Republican Committee does not ag
gregate half that expended In the Mc-
Klnley campaign four years ago.

Sacramento Officials Worrying Over
Non-Arrival of Voting Machines.
SACRAMENTO, Oct. 30. â Sacra
mento County has ordered thirty vot
ing machines, of which twenty have
been delivered and ten were promised
for the 26 th instant, but have not
yet arrived. All efforts by the county
authorities to ascertain the where
about of the machines have been fu
tile, and it is feared that they will
not get here in time for the election.
In that event it may be too late
to make necessary preparations for
voting in some of the precincts to
which machines had been assigned by
the old paper ballot system, and
therefore much confusion may result,
with the possible exclusion from the
elective franchise of many citizens in
this county who are legally entitled to
vote.
The County Supervisors will meet
to-morrow at which time a strenu
ous appeal will be sent to the makers
of the machines urging them to ex
pedite the delivery of them.

TWO MX7RDERERS TRACED
BY A SPIRIT MEDIUM
Disciples of the Cult Claim to Havs
- Brought Nebraska Criminals
to Justice.
LINCOLN, Neb., Oct. SO.â Nebraska
Spiritualists claim that it is due to the
revelation of a trance medium that two
murderers are now within the walls of
the State Penitentiary. The two pris
oners meant are Charles Hutchlnson, a
boy of 19, and his mother, a woman of
35. The boy is sentenced to twelve
years' imprisonment and the woman
to ten years, both for the same crime,
the murder of Ell Feasel, an old man,
Â¦who was their employer.
Through a medium, It is said,
Feasel's body was found buried on his
farm. Evidence was gathered link by
link and then followed the arrest of
young Hutchinson and later that of his
mother. Strong circumstantial evi
dence brought against them at the
trial resulted In their conviction. Both
still maintain their innocence.

was cabled to the United States that
the Emperor is about to issue a man
ifesto granting almost complete free
dom to the press. Is untrue, so far as
can be ascertained here, and
no credence in the best informed cir
cles. It Is true, however, that, as com
pared with the administrations of
Plehwe and his predecessors in the
Ministry of the Interior, the restrictions
on the press have been so relaxed that
the newspapers feel that they are al
most enjoying actual freedom, although
it is not the sort of freedom enjoyed
under constitutional governments. It
is also true that a project of reform
of the^ press administration Is under
consideration which is expected to still
further relax existing restrictions.
GENERAL OKU'S HEADQUAR
TERS, WEDNESDAY, Oct. 26.â The
great armies of Field Marshal Oyama
and General Kuropatkin still lie facing
one another after a week practically
devoid of action. The trenches along
the entire line average only 600 yards
apart. Men are kept in the trenches
night and day exchanging shots.
Neither side dares raise a head above
the parapet. It would be suicidal to
do so. The artillery searches the lines
during the day and at night, the Rus
sians using searchlights. The lines are
so close that outposts are impossible.
At night the pickets of both sides creep
out a few yards to give warning of a
sudden attack and retire before dawn.
The nervous tension Is reaching the
breaking point and a great battle may
be precipitated at night by a single
man losing his mind under the strain.
The casualties caused by the nightly
artillery attacks are small, but the
moral effect is strong. The Russians,
using searchlights, sweep the plain be
tween the trenches at night. This Is
the first time that they have been used
In field operations In the present war.
General Kuropatkin has been largely
reinforced since the battle of Liao
yang. It is believed that many new
troops have arrived from Europe. The
Japanese are bringing up new men and
a move is expected soon. The Japanese,
despite the hard fighting and nervous
strain, are In excellent physical condi
tion.
It Is believed that the next move will
precipitate the greatest battle of this
war. Neither side proposes to move
until it Is ready for the struggle, on
which depends the occupation of Muk
den. ,'/.'":

of Delta, two men carrying bundles,
having the general appearance of
tramps, tried to cross the bridge be
fore the train could get to it. One
of them succeeded, but the other was

his neck being broken. There was ab

and Edwin . Meese and Cary Howard,
members of the special committee on a
municipal water-supply, have returned
from an Inspection of artesian wells In
the Niles district. They devoted their
attention yesterday to an examination
of a flowing well on E. H. Dyer's prop
erty, three miles south of Decoto and
In the Niles artesian belt. This well
showed a capacity of 1,728,000 gallons a
day. It was pumped for hours at the
rate of 1200 gallons a minute.
This test was made that the commit
tee might be assured of the existence
of a large quantity of available water
in the belt. So far aa the individual
well on the Dyer place is concerned,. the
committee took it Into consideration
only as a matter of evidence. Dyer
gave the inquirers ample opportunit>
to observe the action of the well.
Concerning the trip Councilman
Meese, secretary of the committee, said
to-day:
â¢ "The Dyer well of itseif does not bear
particularly upon the quest for a water
supply except as it might be taken as
Indicating the presence of abundant
water in the Niles district. The com
mittee will take Into consideration . this
fact, of course, when it completes its
investigation of the Miller and the Dor
nin urojects. Both of these plans cover
artesian well supplies In the Niles belt,
or cone, as it is known by engineers." j
The committee will meet the en
gineers of the Bay Cities Water Com
pany tcmorrow afternoon in San Fran,

pany's amended proposal. to install a
complete plant for Oakland.

AID FOR CHURCH
The slory and beauty of Greece have been
sung by Innumerable poets. Athens stands
forever In the imagination as the acme of art.
Tet the architectural beauty of Athens was
due to the fact that for thirty years Pericles
turned Its revenue* from war. Into the build
ing of the cltr. The money devoted to war
In the United States would give a granite sea
wall to every harbor and make every city a
man-el of beauty for Its public buildings.
The greatest argument Against war to-day
is that from the side of economics. It is too
costly to suit this calculating. age. The waste
of war is frightful. It Is estimated that the
Civil War cost America ?5.000.000,000. The
sieves could have been bought and paid' for
with $1,000,000,000. In other words, a peaceful
solution of the difficulty would have meant
?4.<*>0.COO,000 in the pockets of the people..
A warlees world seems indeed a far-off di
vine event. A preacher Is almost afraid to
spÂ»ak on such a subject left he be accused of
being impractical. Yet the visionary of to
day Is the conqueror of to-morrow. In spite
of all apparent incongruity and in spite of the
distance that universal peace lies in the fu
ture, let u* still work and pray for this grand
consummation of human lite and history*
When James G. Blalne was Secretary of
State he called a Pan-American Congress.
Delegates met at Washington from all the
Governments* Of North and South America.
The public preÂ»g hailed the event as marking
the end ot strife and war among the various
t>eoples of the New AVorld. Within twelve
months three or four of the South American
republics had each other by the throat. Even
Mr. Bl.ilne laughed at the absurdity of thq
situation. Only a short time before the Rus
sian-Japanese war the Czar called an Inter
national Peace ConEresti to discuss the possi
bility of doing away with war as a means Of
settling dlspiltes.
But we are not discouraged. We should not
laugh at these apparently futile attempts.
There will have to be many | more seemingly
fruitless attempts before the end Is reached.
Our duty is to talk and preach the duty and
the beauty of universal peace. Also its econ
omy and common sense. ,It is not I0O years
yet since dueling was done away with in this
country as. a means of settling personal dis
putes. And Dr. Beecher's sermon was one of
the most potent factors In creating the mlchty
tide of public sentiment that did away with
the barbarous customs. Doubtless In 100 years
the world will look on war as we now look
on dueling, as something unworthy of rational
human beings.
We take courage, too, when we think of
how men of every nation are raising up
against war as a means of deciding differ
ences. Why right from Russia comes j the
message of Tolstoy himself, the strongest pro
test of the literature of the age. And rather
strange to say from Russia, too, came Verest
charrln, the noble ralnter who sousht trt so
picture the horrors of war that mankind would
turn from It In disgust. The German Kaiser
has paid the tribute to the power of the artist
of forbidding the display of his pictures In the
German empire.
Rev. F. S. Brush of the First Presby
terian Church selected as his sermon
topic "The World's Hope of Peace,"
and in part said:
WAR STILL NECESSARY.
a San Juan, tahe a Port Arthur or drive the
JajÂ« into, the sea.
There n*ver will be universal peace until
men realize that war is Irrational and Im
moral. Nations must become Christian as the
follower br the Christ Is a Christian. This calls
for arbitration, which Is good business sense,
sound reason and law.

GIRLS' CLUB TO HAVB
A HOUSING BENEFIT
War doea not make heroes; It only reveals
them. Militarism does call for brute courage,
but its tendency is to dwarf moral heroism.
Tell m*. who U the greater hero, a Kuropatkm
or a LJnngston, - a Kurokl or, a Stanley, a
1 tÂ«wÂ«7 or a Father Damien ? It requires more
rÂ»al heroism to plod on in the face of diffi
culties alone and unaided than it does to storm
Fir*t ot all. I believe that the politician
who is guilty of fomenting war should be
forr r<i to leave his bacchanalian clubs and go
to the front and fight it out himself. Many a
war might be avoided if we could get rid of
the politician. Statesmen we love and honor
and win follow, but politicians are a bane to
Â¦ny country. Secondly, we must make our
military and naval officers feel that war Is not
necessary to their profession, that, they can be
diplomats and tniard'.ans of the peace without
the clash of arms.
for so long as the ilonroe Doctrine is a red
rag to some foreign bull or potentate; ao long
as some Ruwiui wolf masked In cheep's
clothing, whining for universal peace, but at
the seme time going about seeking whom he
may devour; so long as there Is stalking
abroad a horde of International land grab
ben, who Will grasp everything that is not
under lock and key and guard as well; so long
a* the fickle fiend cf an Abdul Hamid guards
the gales of the world's hades, JuÂ»t so long
Â¦wUI we tw*d a well equipped army and a
powerful navy and a man in the White House
mho kuowe how to fight as well as to rule.
Now. that sounds quite warlike, but it Is
the best way toward peace. It Is all right
to dream of a Utopia to come when the kid
and the wolf shall lie down together and a
little child shall lead them. But as it is to
day there ie too much snarl left In the wolf.
His claws and teeth are too sharp. He has not
lost hi* appetite for good tender lamb, and the
ooe mission of the child Is to keep them apart,
at least until the wolf can learn a better way
cf living. Until then we must look for another
way tow*rrl universal peace beeid-s destroying
cur weapons of defense. And what is that
other way?
"Some Practical Steps Toward Uni
versal Peace" was the theme of the
Rev. L. Potter Hitchcock of the First
Congregational Church, who in the
course of hla address said:
ThlÂ« is I'eace* Sunday, but not a day when
the paster feÂ«is that he is called upon to pitch
Into our national executive for some of his
warlike measures. Nor is it a day for rout
ing our standing army cr demolishing our
navy with the rapid fire of words. I have no
sympathy with that kind of sentimental gush.
ECONOMY OF PEACE.
What'. Nothing: to us If a hundred thou
sand of our rare have fallen in battle and
hundreds of thousands more have been maimed
and marred for life? Nothing to us â all the
hrartachee. pain and divease and death?
Nothing- to us. the mourning in a
hundred thousand homes? Nothing to
uÂ». the awful paesiens kindled on
ttw battlefield and rekindled by telegraph
around the world; newspapers reeking with
the awful tales of b'ood being read at the
breakfast table cntll net even the cheek of
the fairest iri the land pales at the dÂ«ath of
thousands, and the eyes of our children sparkle
*ith joy at the elaying of tens of thousands?
Is it nothing to us that Japan, for whom we
have just made room at the council board of
nations, ehould devote her freshly conned
l*-Â«ons of civilization, not to the nobler arts
of peace, but to the waging of war with all the
ferocity of savagery and all of the diabolical
fkill of science and learning? Is it nothing to
us that commerce should be paralyzed, that
our shipping lie idle at the docks, that the
oour^ of industry be disturbed, workmen
turning from the manufacture of the imple
ments of peace and civilization to devise
engine* of war and supply materials for the
destruction of human lives beyond number?
Is all this nothinc to us?
Oh. no: By every tradition of God and man
It is everything to us. The nations are knit
together. A heart thrcb In Toklo or St. Peters
burg U frit Instantly and keenly In New York
and San Krancisco. War is a relic of other
days and mum pass away along with dueling
*r.d trial by combat, to be succeeded by Inter
national arbitration.
Tho motives in war have been mainly re
\ense, pillage and conquest; ambition, either
I^rsonal or national; stlf-dcfense. or an un
selfish derense of a weaker nation against a
stronger. In most van all these elements
exist, and the present struggle is no exception
to the rule. We are all accustomed to think
<~>f sucb a conflict as one that is Done of our
business.
ALAMEDA. Oct. 30.â Local ministers
of the several denominations observed
to-day as Peace Sunday and in their
sermons dwelt upon the evils of war
and advocated the Institution of a
court of arbitration to settle the dis
putes arising between nations.
Rev. P. C. McFarlane of the Chris
tian Church took for his subject, "Shall
There Be An End to War?" and said in
part:
Its Abolition Possible
Only by the Adoption
of Christian Ideals
The body, was taken to San Francisco,'
where it was interred in the Servian
Cemetery after priests of the Greek
church had held religious services over
it according to the rites of that body of
religious worshipers.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, Oct. 30.
Greek gypsies encamped at Frultvale,
defiant cf the Coroner, refusing to sur
render the body of a. boy of their tribe
who had died yesterday, gave way to
day to the law and delivered the corpse
of Philip* Stergue, 6 years old, to Cor
oner Mehrmann this morning. The no
madic tribesmen after. much parleying
withdrew from their forceful stand. An
inquest was held, disclosing that the
boy had died from heart trouble, caused
by, typhoid fever.
Strangely mystical were the funeral
arrangements which were made In con
nection with the last, rites over the
gypsy boy. Members of the wandering
band, swarthy and, Stern, took charge
of the preparation of the body. After
the remains- had been clad in new gar
ments the corpse was robed In a shroud
of purest white. With it In the coffin
was placed a piece of silver. With that
were a spool of cotton, needle and
thread, a new comb, a bar of soap, a
complete suit of new clothes and sev
eral letters written in the jargon of the
gypsy tribesmen.
Beventy-flve per cent of the* sales made by
our office during 1004 have been made to people
from outside the city, and I Relieve the same
is true of every real estate firm in Alameda.
There Is a heavy demand for cottage* renting
from $20 tÂ» $30. It 19 almost impossible to
get this class of houses, and many people
have decided to buy property an< j buna.
We are now building five new houses' for
newcomers, and we have eeveral other deals
pending. Five important sales have been made
by our office during the last week, and there
Is a splendid outlook for an active market
during the coming winter and . spring.
Many oÂ£ the people from tha East,
and from other parts of California
who come to Alameda County, after In
specting the various residence dis
tricts, decide upon Alameda as an ideal
heme city, and dealers in that city re
port a heavy increase in business dur
ing the present year. W. W. Ham
mond Jr. of the firm of Hammond &
Hammond, of Alameda, said:
Joseph J. Mason, a prominent real
estate dealer of Berkeley, has Just
opened the Fairvlew Tract, between
Alcatraz avenue and Woojsey street,
and Dana street, and College avenue
in South Berkeley. All the street im
provements have already been begun,
and will be completed at the expense
of the present owner.
One of the most important real estate
transactions of the present year In
Berkeley real estate was the purchase
of the Janes tract in northeast Berkeley
by the Northlands Development Com
pany. The tract has a frontage of 1500
feet on Grove street and 3000 feet on
Cedar street. The company will at
once open the property for settlement.
The members of the Northlands Com
pany are: Wickham Havens, Earl H.
Webb, Francis Ferrier,- George Schmidt
and C. L- Huggins.
Present conditions In this city indicate that
Oakland has a grand future, bat it Is mÂ«n
that build cities, and It lies with us as citi
zens to make our city what it should be.
The hotels of Los Angeles are wonderful.
There are three now being completed which
will cost hundreds fo thousands of dollars
each, to 'say nothlnr of many smaller hotels,
some Just finished and some - under way.
This same progressive spirit and enterprise
applied to Oakland, where natural advantage*
are far superior and climatic conditions more
favorable than they are in lÂ«cs Angeles, will
work far more wonderful results here in the
north than have been worked by the same
means In the south. .
My" recent trtji to J/Â» - Ann elea,~ h<nÂ»Â»irw.
demonstrated to me that while Oakland U
growing, it is not growing aÂ» rapidly as the
southern city. The people of Lob Angeles are
progressive, and this spirit Is so noticeable
that It completely overwhelms newcomers, and
tho^f who are induced to remain In California
are immediately attracted by . the wonderful
activity of the city. The business people, the
rich men, the busy men, all seem to be awake
to the several Interests of that section.
' The influx of new people has been so steady
that there 1* very little desirable rentable
property offered, and ' this increase In the pop
ulation of the city has also contributed to the
maintenance of firm values on property for
Kale. There Is a marked Increase In the
growth of every part of Oakland, and many
Improvements are to be seen in the old as well
as the, new sections of the city. .'
More than half the sales of residence
property made by us during October have been
to incoming new families locating in Oakland.
Presumably there are a great many new peo
ple from the East, who have been renting for
a time, with a view of buying later.
The coming of so many new people
has caused a slight advance in the
value of property in some districts in
Oakland, but generally there has been
simply a fifm maintenance of the val
ues of the first of the year. In dis
cussing the condition of the market,
William J. Laymance of the Laymance
Real Estate Company, said:
Since the first of the present year
1571 new houses have been built' in
Oakland, and the fact that there are
almost no vacant houses in Oakland
indicates that there has been an actual
increase of more than 6000 in the popu
lation of the city sfnee the beginning
o! the year. Prominent real estate
dealers say that fully sixty per cent of
their sales during the summer and fall
have been made to non-resident peo
ple. This would indicate that about
1000 homes have been sold to new
comers to Oakland in the last twelve
months.
A large number of these new arrivals,
are young business men from the East,
who are desirous of establishing
small business enterprises in Oakland.
In proof of their desire to enter into
the commercial life of the city a large
number of these young men have al
ready become members of the Oak
land Board of Trade.
Alameda and Berkeley are also re
ceiving a full share of the general
prosperity. Real estate men In both
these towns report many sales of prop
erty to newcomers, and also say that
they are dally receiving inquiries from
Eastern people as to prices of prop
erty, the cost of home building, and
the tax rate of the city and county.
Dealers In all .-parts of Alameda
County are confident that the winter
market will be more active than ever
before.
Much complaint has been heard from
newcomers to Oakland that they are
unable to find houses for rent- A num
ber of new arrivals have been com
pelled to rent furnished housekeeping
rooms or apartments.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
1016 Broadway, Oct. 30.
While they were , walking from
Lorin Station, the footpad told Miss
Silleman that he was an electrician
employed "in San Francisco. He was
about 25 years old, of medium height,
stocky physique and dark complexion.
The police have taken hold of the case
and are hopeful that they may be able
soon to: identify Miss Silleman's as
sailant. .... ...;." '
The girl jrot to her feet as quickly
as she could. Unnerved and shocked
by the sudden assault, she hastened to
her home, a short distance away, as
rapidly as she could.
The purse, wh'ich had contained
Miss Silleman's commutation ticket
and some money, was found empty to
day near the Key Route electric pow
er station on Yerba Buena avenue.
Suddenly Miss Silleman was seized
and : knocked .to the ground by her
champion. He gagged her with his
hand, but she managed ,to scream. In
her struggling she twice made an out
cry and attracted the attention of per
sona who were in 'a nearby residence.
Her assailant, fearing that his victim's
cries would bring help, freed Miss
Silleman, grabbed her hand purse and
fled.
At this juncture, a pleasant spoken
young man offered his services as es
cort to Miss Silleman. He said he
had overheard her conversation with
the conductor and would be glad to
see that the young woman arrived
home unmolested. Miss Silleman un
suspectingly and gratefully agreed to
the proposal. At Lbrin she alighted
with her escort. They walked along
Adeline street toward Fifty-fifth
street, conversing. Â¦
To be knocked down and robbed by
the man whom she had accepted as an
escort to her home was the experi
ence last night of Miss Annie Sille
man, a telephone company employe in
San Francisco, who lives at 954 Fifty
fifth street, this city.
It was because she feared footpads
that Miss Silleman allowed the young
man to attend her when she left the
Key Route train at 10 p. m. last night
at Lorin Station. Miss Silleman, was
returning home from San Francisco.
On the Boat and the connecting train
she saw that a negro was closely
watching her. The young woman be
came alarmed at the fellow's â¢ per
sistent stare and appealed to the train
conductor-. He advised the girl to con
tinue on to Berkeley instead of leav
ing the car at her station and then
ride back. , In that way Â¦ she would
know whether she was really being
followed.

Directors of Local Hotel Negotiating
With Manager of, the Majestic,
.;Â¦ New York.
The negotiations of the directors of
the St. Francis Hotel for a new mana
ger to succeed Allan Poll ok have nar
rowed down to three prominent East
ern men, the most notable of .whom is
Copeland Townsend, manager; of 'the
Majestic Hotel of New York. Townsend
was selected two years ago by the. Fair
heirs to manage the Fairmont Hotel,
now being finished on Nab Hill, and he
made a trip to this city to look over the
plans : and site of San Francisco's â¢ fu
ture elegant hostelry. Apparently,
however, Townsend and the owners. of
the Â« Fairmont - disagreed; ; for.* hardly,
had Townsend returned J to f New/. York
before the statement was gtven: out
that he had abandoned the idea of
coming to San Francisco.
The two other hotel men with whom
the directors jof, the St. . Francis . are In
communicatio'ri are the assistant man
ager of the Holland House .* of New'
York and the manager of one of Bos
ton's ; most fashionable establishments.
It is expected. that definite replies will
be received from these men in a few
idays, in time to permit the hotel direc
tors to act upon them at their, meeting
to be held on November 3. = At the same
meeting It is intended to â¢ increase â¢ the
present membership, of - the hotel direc
tory from seven to nine. It 'is reported
that one of the new members of the
board will be Leopold Michaels, j who
owns a big block of- the company's
stock. ' BS9BQ9a^lÂ§iS3IÂ£^lil

The blame, according to Superintend

Â¦were running twenty-five miles an hour,
when they should have had their ; train
under control. The first section of east
bound passenger . train } No. r 10 was

light of No. 10 prevented his seeing, the
red light on first No. 3.
The Coroner's verdict blames the flag
man of the first section for not properly
flagging the second section, and the en
gineer of the second section. for coming
Into the station in a careless manner.

Rates on the
Overdue
Ships.
Another blubber hunter arrived in
port yesterday, being the third whaler
oil laden from the northern waters to
corce home at the close of the season.
The vessel Is the bark Charles W. Mor
gan. Captain J. A. M. Earle, thirty
three days from the Ohkotsk Sea, with
1600 barrels of oil. The catch was forty
eeven Eperm and two right whales.
Mrs. Earle and her little son were pas
sengers on the bark during the cruise.
One of the crew, Manuel Silva, died at
eea November 25.
The Morgan left this port November
17, 1903, proceeding by way of the Ha
waiian Islands to Guam. At this naval
station about half of the crew prepared
to desert the bark. One night when
the captain and most of the officers
were ashore the men made ready to
leave. They could not lower the boats
from the davits, as this work would be
too noisy, so they took all the covers
from the hatches and dropping them
over the side lashed them together,
making a large raft. On this means of
transportation they were preparing to
paddle away when the alarm was given
and one of the officers appeared on
deck. The tackle which had been used
to lower the raft over the side was still
attached to it, and the officer ordered
the men that were yet on board to
hoist away. The result was that the
improvised raft was tilted up and the
deserters, with their dunnage, spilled in
the water. â¢-;â¢<-â¢'*'
It was a clever trick, and as the bay
is full of sharks, who prefer a dish of
sailor to anything on a Guam bill of
fare, the would-be runaways made
brilliant records getting out of the
water and up the bark's side. They
were all very penitent and as
sured the skipper that nothing was
so enjoyable as catching whales,, and
only asked the privilege of hunting
blubber in the Charles W. Morgan all
their natural lives. The skipper gave
them his blessing and set them to
Flushing down the masts to keep them
from getting homesick.. .Those whose
ba^page is yet drifting somewhere out
on the broad Pacific dipped into the
"slop chest" for-a new outfit at about
four prices for each garment, a stiff de
ductiun from each man's pay-day of oil
and the spirit of desertion was dead.
When the vessel reached Nagasaki
Captain Earle tranquilly passed into
the harbor, where -he received a bit of
information that almost jarred the
oakum out of his seams. He was sail-
Ing, over some of 'the liveliest mines
Â«ver planted for the smashing of a
EhJp. The light draught of his little tub
of a bark had carried her safely above
the submarine infernos, and the nitro
glycerin volcanoes" were still a-slumber.
The port pilots took charge of the fur
ther navigation of the vessel, and the
Japanese officers exhausted their Eng-
lish and their breath explaining to
Captain Earle how near he came to
taking a cruise up in the clouds. After
that when the Charles "W. Morgan had
an occasion to enter a Japanese port
Ehe was more deliberate.
Ovcrdues Still Out-

surance art still out. The German ship Sl
rene. which has been on the list for several,

THE Colorado campaign sizzles like tropical. sunshine. The po
tent passions in that State developed by the internal troubles
of the last two years are now fermenting in the political am
bitions of men, and the result is a riot of misrepresentation and de
traction. . So rampant are the followers of Senator Patterson that
it has been proposed that they hold a liars' mass meeting: The
proposition is frowned upon because no hall would, hold -them, and
the rigors of the weather forbid an outdoor assemblage. â¢
In the rock and riot, however, the Republican managers have
kept their heads and it is believed that the State is safe for Roose

perfectly Is greatly in its favor. The

FOR THE THEATER
WIXTHROP L. MARVIN, secretary to the Congressional Mer
chant Marine Commission, in a recent interview for a New
York paper, gives voice to the results that have already been
achieved by the commission's partially completed investigation.
Though the Congressmen have yet to make a study of marine con
ditions in the ports of the Southern seaboard States and a return
?isit to New York harbor, Marvin is assured that by the labors they
have already completed overwhelming evidence of the universal de
mand for an improved merchant marine has been obtainedk
"The idea that finds expression in some newspapers," says the
commission's secretary, "that the loss of our ships, our shipyards,
our splendid sailors and skilled workmen is a matter of no particular
concern, and that if foreigners through cheap wages or subsidies, or
both combined, can drive our ships off the ocean they ought to do so,
has no reflection in the sentiment of American business men; or at
le&st of the hundreds of American business men who have appeared
before the Merchant Marine Commission."
Mr. Marvin does not say- that these editorial protests originate
for the most part in the great interior manufacturing towns, centers
for webs of rails to carry their finished' product to every part of the
land. These self-satisfied land-locked ones show a phenomenal lack
of appreciation for the fact that the market for their goods, is not
bounded by the reach of railroads. They seem ready to pay yearly
tolls of greater and greater exorbitance for the carrying of their
goods to foreign shores in foreign bottoms. Yet imagine the storm
of protestations that would arise from these very manufacturers
should the railroads that serve them now so well suddenly become
the property of foreign corporations and demand excessive toil for
the transportation of American goods in America.
Our ship lines are the railroads of the sea. The sooner a general
realization of this fact is impressed upon inland manufacturers the
sooner will we have a merchant marine competent to carry all of our
exports to foreign markets. - "

PASTRY MAKING.
THERE was very little feature to trade last week. Cooler
weather in the East stimulated the demand for "winter goods,
and resulted in a further expansion in this direction, and the
country's bank clearings showed an increase of 44-2 per cent over
the corresponding week last year. This is the heaviest gain for a
long time, though a good deal of it was on the New York Stock
Exchange, where trading in railroad and industrial stocks was re
markably heavy all the week, while the percentage of gain at New
York was 714. The aggregate clearings were $2,779,600,000, of
which $1,826,600,000 was credited to New York. The only important
cities showing losses were Chicago, .2 per cent ; Pittsburg, .1 per
cent, and Kansas City, 8.9 per cent. The two former losses were
so Bm&ll that they were hardly losses at all. The failures for the
week were 233, against 253 last year.*
The continued activity in Wall street was generally, in fact,
unanimously accepted as a true reflex of the improvement in business
throughout the country. But it was noticeable that while there was
no abatement of the buoyancy to which especial attention has been
called of late, there was a growing caution and conservatism among
the larger financial interests, which frowned upon any. undue enthu
siasm and any attempt to rush the market up* to the magnitude of a
boom. No boom is wanted. The current activity in Wall street is
sufficient for all present purposes, and it is even said in well-posted
quarters that it has already served its purpose.
Attention is being called to the fact that large blocks of stocks,
for a long time held by great interests, have been unloaded on the
public, and a great deal of the famous "idle money" so frequently
alluded to of late has passed out of the vaults into general circulation
or invested by new and smaller interests in standard dividend-paying
stocks and desirable bonds. This being already accomplished, there
ie no longer any necessity for rushing the market upward too high.
Let well enough alone. Already -the opinion is growing in some
quarters that there has been advance enough and that any further
rise in stocks would run them up beyond a dividend-paying basis,
which would be unwise and which would result in a corresponding
recession in quotations before long. Hence the banks are inclined
to call a halt, and some are already so doing.
As far as general business is concerned, there is not much to
say. The crops are now practically assured, and as they form the
basis of commercial conditions this year, the country is apparently
safe enough for another twelve months. Collections are good every
where, but especially in the South, which is enjoying the benefits of
a very large cotton crop. The railroads are doing a good business,
as shown by the increase of 6 per cent in earnings during the first
half of October over the same period last year, and already com
plaints of insufficient cars to handle all the freight traffic are spring
ing up here and there.
The chief industries are sending in excellent reports, iron lead
ing, with advancing prices for the cruder forms. Building operations
all over the country are increasing, and there is a corresponding
improvement in the demand for lumber in many sections. Raw
wool is less active in the East, but the tone of the market is still
strong, with a brisk demand throughout the West and the woolen
mills generally running full time. Hides and leather are very firm,
with prices tending upward. Provisions continue quiet and feature
less, and the slackening of the demand for wheat and flour noted
last week still continues, though the falling off is not as pronounced
as it was ten days ago. General farm products continue active at
high prices, with sellers exacting full figures and buyers paying them
willingly. The money market is easy all over the country, with
plenty of funds in banks and private hands, and no inconvenience in
supplying the necessary cash to move the crops. ; In fact, it is be
lieved that two-thirds of this movement is over. Not for years have
the crops been so readily and easily moved, and, what is best, without
any strain or outside assistance, which has been the rule for some
years past. '.
This, in brief, is the country's- commercial situation. It is excel
lent, as will be seen. What more could be desired?

Popularity Leaves Girl Who
Is Independent and Flippant
VERT often the girl who does not
get on well with . men is self
conscious, or, perhaps, she
tries to be smart or -is too
much given to laughing at the wrong
time.
There Is one thing most men cannot
stand, and that is being laughed at;
they like the girl who laughs with
them; they have no use for the one
who laughs at them, says a writer in
the Philadelphia Bulletin.
A sense of humor is a very delight
ful quality, but I do not believe that
tt enhances a , girl's charm much in
the eyes of a man.
JULJEbe- s'lf-consclous girl never gets
â¢^rVnough away from herself to be
;~i'U!ar; she is conscious of her looks,
her speech, her actions; she Is all Self,
with a capital S. â
Xa order to be popular with men,
or women either for that matter, it
la necessary to put self in the back
ground and make the other person
the central point of interest.
The girl who Is absolutely natural
and unaffected is pretty sure to be
popular.
If she grows independent and flip
pant she loses her popularity.
Do not think that you must always
have ' a smart answer ready. Clever
repartee is all very well in its way.
but you can get on Just as well with
out It.
If you want the men to like you
leave all the funny business to them;
your part is to be gentle, sweet and
lovable.
Never make fun of men when talk
ing to a man; he will naturally im
agine that you talk of him in the
same way.
Men always fight shy of the girl
who is very witty at other people's
expense. They enjoy bavin?; her with
them when In a crowd. She is what
they call a "good fellow." but they
don't fall In love with her.
A girl need not feel that she is stn
pld because she cannot always an
swer a witty remark with one of Ilk*
kind. As long as she appears bright
and Interested * she will eet oa well
enough.
Nothing is more tiresome than the
person who attempts to be funny; wit
Is spontaneous; It cannot be manufac
tured to order.
Perhaps another fault of thÂ« un
popular girl Is that she Is too Inde
pendent.
' The clinging;, absolutely dependent
girl is a thing of the past; In thess
strenuous days she Is bound to go to
the walL
There la a happy medium, however;
a srirl who Is modest and self-reliant,
without being; too assertive. Bh* does
not forget her womanhood, nor Vet
is she constantly taking advantajps of
Men like the fir! who acknowledges
their superior strength and Is willing
to defer to their oslnious Is matters
which they know more about than she
possibly could.
You all know, girls, how nie* tt Is
to hav* a man whom you car* . for
perform little thoughtful acts of kind
ness and courtesy for yon. Well, if
yon axa too independent no man will
care to treat you in that way.
The girl who thinks she eaa do
everything; for herself will bÂ« left
pretty well to her own resources.
This Is not a sermon, girLs; tt Is
merely a little f rlendly ad-rtc* to thoa*
of you who feel that 70a arc not pop
ular with men.
Elt down and talk It orsr with jawr*
self, and see If you are not too smart
or too Independent or Mlf-eonsdotu.

have already been established, The

their share toward" fitting uj> one of
! these elubhouisc homes.

One thousand dollars ic barely ;
enough to furnish such a . home, : yet
by the economic axpendituro of the

The rent of the house is paid by the
girls, who must, in two annual in
stallments, return one-tenth of the
money advanced by the board.
A group of fifteen girls is now ask
ing the board of trustees to establish
a clubhouse home.
The subscriptions from each club
should be made up and sent to the
treasurer Of the clubhouse fund, Mrs.

The Council of Women ' meets on
Saturday, the 5th. at Golden. Gate
Hall, with Mrs. John F. Swift in the
chair. ' / -
Among the topics of interests that
will crop up after the electlonT^-or be
fore ; â is the movement now on foot to
place two California statues in Stat
uary Hall in Washington. Mrs.'. Jo^
sephine E. Foster, who is deeply inter
ested in the matter, will advocate the
honoring of the one logical' name,
Fray Junlpero Serrl.
Such action has been taken by the
Pioneer Daughters and the Native"
Daughters, both of . which bodies rec
ognize the legitimacy of the claim -of
the. famous old monk to this honorâ
""which, by the way, he probably would
Etrongly veto were* his permission
csked. But- that Is neither here nor
there â California owes it to herself
to act thuyly. A Ipo that she beware
of placing herself in the embarrassing
liositioH that Minnesota found herself. ,

RADIUM HALL, 783% Market and 1 Fourth
(corner Market and Fourth).
"REXRADIO" uses neither medicine nor
medical instruments, heals solely by "hu-
manlsed radium." -
"OSSIFIED" lady (Mrs. Knowles, 379 Bart-
lett), years "bedridden," helpless. Joints
immovably grown together (Inflammatory
rheumatism), after (one) treatment "freely"
moved each loosened Joint and still does.
Visit *Â»er.
"TYPHOID FEVER"â Mr. Knott, 112 Fell,
was In height of raging fever heat, gallop-
ing pulse, vomiting "blood"} 2 treatments
Â§ "broke" the fever, opening pores and casting
out the virus by profuse sweat Next day,
thqugh weak, attended to business; few
days later went to mountains prospecting.
He gave Rexradio large block of stock In*
rtch mine, which he declined, feeling amply
repaid in saving a human life. Mr. K.
â¢ says: "Tell the world I am ready to swear
' Rexradio's marvelous power saved my life."
"REXRADIO" is now treating the well known
"Judge " for fever, with prompt, marked
succe-s. â¢
"BLINDNESS" feared: "My sight almost
gone, couldn't recognlie faces at 2 feet or
read 'large' print; 2 treatments and I knew
faces at 80 feet and easily read 'small'
print" ' _____
"RE-XRADIO" in a few days cured my large
"cancer"; no trace left.
"REXRADIO" instantly made me breathe
freely through my long-closed nostrils (ca-
tarrh^
"REXRADIO'S" 2 treatments removed large
black and blue "contusion" (from burglar's
blow). Â¦ â¢
"REXRADIO." In my bouse, made 2 "deaf
mutes", hear and "speak" what I and others
spoke.
"REXRADIO" Instantly made another "deaf
mute" hear and speak In presence of Mr.
Butler of 3. F. Chronicle. ' .
"REXRADIO'S" (one) treatment made my 18
years' "totally deaf" ear hear whisper at
. 70 feet. _______
"REXRADIO" (says city M. D.) "wonder-
fully helped cases. Incurable by medicine, in
my offices."
"KBXRADIO" j (says second M. D.) "made
; 'deaf mute' hear and speak in my offices."
; "REXRADIO" (a third leading M. D. testifies
in writing) "In my presence made a 'totally
', deaf ear, in 8 Seconds, hear distant 'whis-
pered' words." ' ' ' --:Â¦;Â¦"'â¢'
! "LEAPING!"â Rexradlo instantly helped my
' " "paralyzed" leg and I walked, ran, "leap-
1 ed." .
"REXRADIO" Instantly made my "anchy-
losed" knee Joint move freely. (Many more).
"REXRADIO" made my 17 years "totally
deaf" ear hear "whisper" at 73 feet.
' "REXRADIO" promptly removed my (lnherit-
; ed) "gastritis".; I aaw him do many won-
ders.
DEAF MUTE (one of many) â "Last week
after (only) 3 seconds' treatment. Rexradio
! caused a (born) 'deaf mute' to hear 15 sen-
{ tences, 68 words (spoken and 'whispered'),
which patient Instantly 'spoke* intelligibly.
1 Each of 'us' then spoke to patient with
same wonderful results. Get our addresses
1 at office. Signed, Mr. and Mrs. de Sales,
:R. Kennedy, J. Potter, K. Hall, J. Mc-
Iaaac. eto."
PHYSICIAN'S advice to Radium Hall audi-
ence: "If incurable by meUlclne. try Rex-
radio." â¢ Â¦
DUMB â Rexradlo made "totally dumb" man
, Instantly speak well. Many witnesses.
"REXRADIO' 8" two treatments fully cured
my "pneumonia" like magic.
PARALYSISâ "His one treatment mads me
use my disabled arm, leg, naturally; I ran,
Jumped."

â¢ .-Miller is . supposed to have learned
that inquires were in progress and left
here Saturday* night for the north, but
was able to get as far as Roseburg
only, when he was stopped. He is sup

MEDFORD, Or.. Oct. SO.â Aa the re
sult of the investigations of a special
agent of the Department of the Inte
rior during the past two weeks Harry
W. Miller was arrested and taken from
the north-bound train at Roseburg and
placed under arrest on a charge of at
tempting to defraud the United States
of public lands.
Miller came to Medford from Little
Rock about the 1st of last September.
Simultaneously with his arrival here
were ' made a great number of timber,
land filings in Townships 40 and 41
south, range 2 and 3 west. The fact
that these filings were made in almost
solid blocks and the further fact that
many of them were made by persons
who it was alleged were not of suffi
cient means to pay the expense of loca
tion and advertising and to pay $400 for
the land when the proofs were had led
the Government land officials to sus
pect an irregularity. The attention of
the General Land Office was called to
the matter and special agents were sent
to investigate.

Jimmy; Britt,-- the greatest ; fighter of
his inches produced in California and
holder. of: the feather-weight champion
ship title, will make a bold bid to-night
in Mechanics* Pavilion for the * light
weight championship of the world. He
will meet Joe Gans, a 'master hand at
the art of boxing and one of the great
est tacticians the Queensberry ring has
produced. Gans never ; : makes - an v iiih^
necessary move of hand : or foot.* That
he is a powerful hitter is shown by, the
number of knockouts credited to him in
his ten years of fighting.' For the first
time in three years he is to fight at the
recognized lightweight limitâ 133 pounds
ringside. If Â¦ he were allowed to fight at
136 pounds, the weight dictated, by Erne
when Gans defeated him for, the cham
pionship, it. is conceded by betting; men
he would be a strong one to two choice.
He was an eight to ten' favorite on Sat
urday when "betting/ closed, and. the
odds : may "be lengthened to-day when
it is' known he ; will come -in "at Â£he; re
quired weight easily. That ; he : is satis
fied with his condition, is evident, as, he
says, "I have no excuses whatever to
offer." " . f. â¢ '.';â¢â¢â¢: '.-_ Â¦:. ; -": ..;'â¢;.
' - Whether ten years ; of ;Â¦ training Â¦ and
fighting have ; impaired / Gans' vitality
wilt 1 be demonstrated to-night' ,*b"efore
many rounds Â¦ have been fought, l' -. r
! Opposed to Gans ia a fresh,- vigorous
boy bubbling over with' vitality.*; HeÂ» is
a natural - fighter,; who never gives way
an inch. Blows which 'Â¦ would stop s an
ordinary boxer, seem- only: to stir him
to greater action. He has not | been? a
knockout hitter, but , he -has* invariably
punished his opponents severely. â¢ .He
has never been defeated, either as ama
teur '.or .professional. .The spectators
wil^see some sensational fighting when
the .men are * sent .together
Britt ' has said ' he' will go " after; Gans
from .the tan . of the gong. . Gans wants
to . win quickly . also, " as j" he does . not
want to weaken . in Â¦: a long â¢ drawn 1 out
struggle. '..%' '-'^ /""-. -Â¦"Â¦'.-Â»"Â¦- "' 'Â¦'.'

when with two to 'the woods they be
gan to sting: 'the 'offerings of Fitzger
ald. In a twinkling -two -runs: were
squeezed in and. the game was settled.
Batting Rally in Eighth.
Both pitchers worked brilliantly till
the sixth, when Sheehan erred on
Schalfley's grounder. Kruger swung
on a fast one and it soared away out
to the extreme corner of left field for
"Germany" Schmidt waded in after
the Tacoma batters in the afternoon
struggle fearless and brave. He
twisted' 'em around their necks,
dropped 'em to their ankles and" had
each and every slugger breaking his
neck in a vain and foolish attempt to
get a hit.
Keefe was' pretty effective himself,
but unfortunately errors helped, the
runs .aloiiff in the second and sixth
rounds. The Commuters never bunch
ed hits on the phenom from Santa
Clara College in any one inning. Had
he received the support his efforts
warranted, the two teams might be
playing ball yet without result.
Schlalley was treated to- a pass in
the second., but Kruger forced him on
a bunt, which was well handled by
Keefe. Krugrer stole and Streib un
loaded one of those fatal Texas boys in
short left. Kruger rounded third and
tore for the plate. McLaughlin heaved
to Graham and ball and runner ar
rived together. Kruger, made a grand
slide and the ball got away from Gra
ham. :' v'*:-
The Commuters have decided they
can play better baseball than the
Timers when they strike their gait and
everything goes as Peter Lohman
would have it. Yesterday they batted
whe;.i hits counted most; fielded bril
liantly in the tight places and both
Jcnes and Schmidt twirled the kind of
ball that plays havoc with batting
averages.
Down. the line go the Tigers. The
ground on which they stood so firmly
but two weeks âago is fast slipping
from under, their feet and the base
ball pennant which Mike Fisher was
getting ready to christen seems dim
mer and dimmer in the distant horizon
as the days" flit by. Two cruel blows
were aimed at the King yesterday by
the " Commuters and they both went
true to the mark. Oakland won twice
â scores, 2 to 1 and 2 to 0.

February last, and she 'did not know
whether he- was dead or alive. The

the case and he ascertained 5 that Moe
is now. an insructor /in " French '.. and
Spanish at ' the ' State . University, re
ceiving a salary of $800 per year.
Peshon saw Moe last Friday, who told
him that when' he married' his wife
he had $50,000 and she soon went
through it. He" gave her the. â¢ last
$1000 of it when /he left New' York
for Arizona for his health. : Since then
he had been sending her money-when

The Orpheum Circuit Company is
expanding and on October, 22 opened
a new theater in Minneapolis.
Morris Meyerfeld Jr., president of the
company, attended the inaugural and
writes that It was an eminently suc
cessful affair. The house, which is
the prettiest and most capacious in the
city, was packed and the audience left
thoroughly enthusiastic.
This is the second new theater
which the Orpheum Company has
opened this season, the first being the
famous Tootles Theater of St. Joseph,
Mo., which was taken over to make
another link in the vaudeville chain
that now embraces every vaudeville
city of importance in the West.
The Orpheum Circuit Company now
owns theaters in San Francisco, Los
Angeles, Denver, Omaha, Kansas City,
St. Joseph, Minneapolis and: New Or
leans, as well as being affiliated with
theaters in St Louis, Cincinnati. Chi
cago and other large centers, making
the strongest vaudeville combination
in the world.
To put a fitting keystone in this cir
cuit the Orpheum people are now en
gaged in building a theater in Chicago
to cost $1,000,000 and will make it the
finest playhouse in the Windy City
and the finest theater in the world de
voted to vaudeville. Ground has al
ready been broken on State street, be
tween Monroe and Dearborn, and the
structure â¢will be completed as soon as
possible.

The two cars were badly battered.
The front of Car 717 was stove In, and
hardly a pane of glass remained in
tact. * .
Hill and Mrs. Schmitzer proceeded
by the same car to the Park Em
ergency Hospital, where they were
treated by Dr. Pinkham. Hill lost con
siderable blood and Mrs. Schmltzer's
hip was painfully contused, but the in
juries of neither are regarded as se
rious.
Passengers who were hanging to the
outer rails of both cars lost hold and
felL Luckily the accident occurred in
the midst of the sand dunes and most
of the people tumbled Into a soft bank,
Mrs. Schnii tzer was not so fortunate.
In falling she struck against a rail
and received some painful bruises.
Hill, her escort, was bathed for an
instant in a shower of falling glass,
and then was flung head over heels
into. a sand bank, where he remained
dazed for some moments.- A small
artery in his hand was cut. Though
nearly all the windows In both cars
were broken, none of the other pas
sengers were hurt by the glass, which
flew In all directions.
With a crashing of splintered wood
and broken glass, car 717 crashed Into
the rear of the car ahead, knocking
passengers from their feet. Harry Hill
and Mrs."M. Schmltzer, who were lean-
Ing against the rear window of car 717,
were hurled from the platform.
Two : persons were hurt and others
badly frightened by the collision of two
electric cars near the Ocean Beach yes
terday. Car 1317 on the way to the
Clio* slowed down just past the Chain
of Lakes Station. Behind it was car
717 whirling along rapidly on- the down
grade. Both cars were crowded.
Senator Stewart expects to remain In
San Francisco for a week. He is here
to attend to private business matters
acd for a needed rest.
United States Senator - "William M-
Stewart of Nevada arrived here yester
day and Is registered at the St. Francis
Hotel. Recent reports that Senator
Stewart was still Â¦ ambitious to serve
another term in the Senate were em
phatically denied by him. He declared
that he was not a candidate in ambush
and under no circumstances would he
again seek public honors from the peo
ple of Nevada. Upon this subject he
said:
You an deny any reports concerning the
possibility of my accepting another term - in
otfioe. for I have made uz> my mind to retire
tar good. The outlook for a. Republican vic
tory in the Stale of Nevada, was never better
Â¦ad It 1* certain thai It will be a decisive oae.
George Mxos of Wlnnemncca, Republican can.
dldite tor the United Stales Sen&torship, will
undoubtedly win his fight, and there is no
doubt tnat James YerrlOKton will go to Wash
ington ae a Republican Congressman.
