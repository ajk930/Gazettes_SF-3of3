his "life while fishing in :the . Trnckee
River near here to-night. The youngster
hooked an immense rainbow trout in an

the boy into the turbulent stream.

the line and in the struggle. that ensued
the pole was . broken. The . young . fisher
man was pulled down the stream," finally
striking a whirlpool, which landed
him under the bough of a willow tree,
which he grasped. In this position: he
kept himself above water 'with one hand
and '"with the other held on to the fish
line until he tired the fish, and with his
prize dragged himself to ' shore;

PORTSMOUTH, N. H., Aug. 29.â T0-da/s happy con
clusion of the peace conference*, which a week ago would have
been < shipwrecked ; had it not been for the heroic intercession of
President Roosevelt, was sudden and dramatic. For the sake of
peace, "Japan, with the magnanimity of ; a victor, .jat the last
moment "yielded everything still in issue.
-Russia refused to budge from the ultimatum Emperor Nich
olas had given to President Roosevelt through Embassador Meyer.
No indemnity under any guise, but an agreement to divide -Sag*.
halien and reimburse Japan for the maintenance of prisoners were
his last words. They had been repeatedly reiterated in Mr. de
Wittc's instructions, and, at the request for a written reply to" the
Japanese compromise proposal of last Wednesday, they. were deliv
ered to Baron Komura this morning.
De Witte 's Unyielding Attitude.
Mr. de Witte went to the conference declaring he was power
less to change the dot of an "i" or the crossing of a "t" in his in
fstructions. Emperor Nicholas' word had been given not only to
him, but to President Roosevelt, the head of a foreign state.
When Baron Komura, therefore, first offered the new basis of
compromise outlined in the press dispatches last night (the com
plete renunciation of indemnity, coupled with a proposition for. the
redemption of Saghalien at a price'to be fixed by a mixed tribunal
- consisting of representatives "of the neutral powersâ in fact, if not \u25a0
in words, the solution offered* by the President) Mr. de Witte
again returned a non-possumus. It was what Mr. de Witte termed
in-a later interview the "psychological moment." â
J^pmura Springs the Surprise.
Mr.^de Witte did not flinch. He feared a rupture, and, as he
Vl expressed*' it faftenvard, he was stunned by what occurred. Baron
Komura gave, way on all the disputed points. With* the prescience
"that has enabled the Japanese to gauge the mental processes or
their; adversaries on; the field of battle and upon the sea.^ they had'
realizedin advance that peace could be obtained inj no^other way.
They fhad; warned their -Government ; President Roosevelt also? it
is believed, -had advised Japan that it were better to meet the Ru3-
While the "tainted money" agitation
has annoyed \u25a0 the family, it has not
worried the father or son, who sin
cerely believe .their wealth has come
to them by honest, legitimate means
and through hard work, economy, en
ergy and enterprise. .
Rockefeller Jr. left the- Adlrondacks
to-day with his family for Cleveland,
0., where he will confer with his father
upon some of the gifts to be made this
coming autumn. He will remain there
for several weeks. From Cleveland he
will come to New York to open his
Sunday school class for the winter.
This will be on the "first Sunday in Oc
tober.
It is said that when Rockefeller Jr.
was In Europe last winter he was im
pressed by the large gifts of money
made for the public good by sev
eral wealthy Europeans, and directly
after his arrival In New York he spoke
to his father about making similar con
tributions here. His father carefully
considered the matter and finally con
sented to follow his son's sugges
tion. The son is anxious that his father
do all possible good' with his money
and is always studying out ways and
means to that end. '

will astonish thef country. Ills method
of selecting: objects for his benefactions

learned by the younger man when he
was in Europe a few months ago.

Ueutnant Colonel W. H. C. Bowen' was

trial by Captain U. G. McAlejcander.% A
hot ftsht was put up to save the young
lieutenant, but the amount of testimony
was overwhelming. and he was convicted
on the charges perf erred against him.
Early in June of this year he was
brought before a second court-martial.

Up to the last he had expected that the
findings of the court-martial would be re

The case of Lieutenant Richards has
occupied the attention of army circles for
over a year and a half. Early in 1304
Pochards was brought back from Manila
and tried by a court-martial at the Pre
eldlo fcr duplicating his pay accounts and
for other irregularities. The president
of the court-martial was Colonel William
1... Pitcher, Twenty-eighth Infantry, and
Captain Clarence E. Dentler was Judge
advocate. The trial began March 23, 1904,
and dragged along all summer. Richards
had for his attorneys H. W. Day and R.
L* Hathorn. A tremendous fight was,
made to save the honor of the young offi
cer and keep him in the army. Richards
6enSor came out from New York and bat
tled in his son's behalf, and brought with
him ot&er prominent men to testify re
garding his son's character. The first
trial closed on November 5, IBM, with the
rseult that Richards was acquitted on
the ground of insanity.
Having been acquitted on the ground of
insanity, Richards waÂ» naturally not in
m. position to be an officer In the army.
Consequently a medical board was or
dered to look into his case. At the head
of this board was Lieutenant Colonel
George H. Toraey, Medical Department,
U. S. A. Richards was taken to the
General Hospital at the Presidio, where
he was carefully watched by the board.
On December 12, 1804, the. board decided

TOKIO, Aug. 23.â News or peace came
to Nippon without causing surprise.
There has been the utmost confidence
that the Russians woulc make terms be
fore the Portsmouth conference ended,
and, now that the treaty is assured,
there is only natural jubilation over what
is felt to be the double vlctoory of Jap
anese arms and diplomacy. The conces
sions by the. Japanesa Government, so
far as they are known, are generally ap.-.
proved, especially by t>ie oetter ..classes,
and there is general confidence Ihat ho

"Considerable surprise was shown
aojong French diplomats that the Jap
anese had surrendered so completely
sTolatlve to the question- of Indemnity,
on which they hitherto had held so

enormous bacrifice evoked much com
mendation. It was known that both
â¢boJligerents desired peace, but that, in
order to preserve their national self

sighs of wavering. There was, there

sian position than to take the responsibility of .continuing .the war
for the purjxxse of collecting tribute. The Mikado, at the advice of
â¢ the Cabinet and Elder Statesmen yesterday, had sanctioned the
final concession. When Baron Komura yielded the rest was mere
child's nlav.
Articles 10 and 11 Unterned warships
and limitation of Russia's sea power in
the Far East) were withdrawn. . Japan
agreed that only that portion of the Chi
nese Eastern Railroad south of Quan
choutze, a station near the position occu
pied by Oyama, should be ceded to
Japan.
Both sides, when the deadlock was
broken, wanted a "Just and lasting"
peace, and in that respect it was decided
to practically neutralize Saghalien, each
country binding itself not to fortfy its
half of the Island and Japan assuming
an obligation not to fortify Le Perouse j
Strait, between Saghalien and Hokkaido, i
which would bar Russia's commercial j
route to the Pacific.
The plenipotentiaries went further.
They decided to add a new clause, in the i
nature of a broad provision for mutual i
commercial privileges, by whfch each I
country will secure for t"he other the
benefit of the "most favored nation"
clause and "the oDen door."
PRIE.VDLY TEXOR OF TREATY.
The new treaty, therefore, will be a
wonderfully friendly document, of a
character almost to raise the suspicion
that the two countries have not negoti
ated peace, but have concluded the basis
of a future alliance. There is, however,
no evidence, as rumored, that any secret
clauses are to be appended to the pres
ent treaty.
Before leaving the conference building
felicitations were exchanged with the
President at Oyster Bay. Both Baron
Kcmura and Mr. de Witt* telegraphed.
The former confined himself to apprising
Mr.- Roosevelt of the conditions upon
which peace had been concluded. Mr. de i
Witte frankly laid his tribute at the Pree- j
Ident's feet. In his message he said: j
"History, will ascribe to you the glory," ;
and added the expression of Russia's |
hearty appreciation of the President's
"generous initiative."
Mr. Roosevelt replied with words of
thanks and congratulation. :
Then began the Jubilation. Mr. de Witte j
and Baron Rosen returned to the hotel j
for luncheon. The Japanese had re- I
malned at the conference hall to take J
luncheon with Mr. Peirce. The news that j
peace had been concluded had preceded j
the Russian plenipotentiaries, and such j
scenes of wild rejoicing have never be- j
fore been witnessed in the State of New j
Hampshire as greeted them upen their \
arrival at the hotel. Mr. de Witte. dazed
at the sudden and happy termination of
the conference, was fairly overpowered
by the tremendous ovation he received.
He could only express his gratitude by
ihaklng the hands of everybody, and in
response to the volley of questions fired
at him as to the terms murmured:
"We pay not a kopeck, and we get half
of Saghaiien."
RUSSIANS CIiAIM VICTORY.
LAter In his room, when he had par
tially recovered himself, he declared that
he could rot have dreamed of such a vie- 1
tory, for that he regards it a diplomatic
triumph of the first magnitude- he makes
no attempt to conceal, and that is the
general verdict here to-night. The Rus
sians are overjoyed at the result. ,
"We have had our Uaoyangs and Muk
<3ens on land." they say. "and our Tsu
ghlmas on sea. but the Japanese have

duced by the .momentous events at the
navy-yard* and the wildly enthusiastic
demonstrations which greeted him on his
I arrival.
I Before Mr. de Witte had passed up the
stairway leading to his apartments the
â¢ crowd began crying: , ,
I "What about indemnity? How much,
j did Russia pay?" â . .
j The word "indemnity" brought Mr. de
] Witto to a halt on the first landing of the
stairway. Turning' to the crowd, deliber
ately .and .with that cornmandine force
which has made his personality the most
potent factor in the peace negotiations,
I the great man of Russia, with words that
I seemed to come through his tightly
I clenched lips, fairly snapped back .to his
| questioners with deep feeling:
] "Pas un sou!" (not a cent). .;
, The ring of pride in his voice told the
I crowd 'that Mr. de AVltte had won his
j victory. He came to Portsmouth de
| daring stoutly that he would not pay
(indemnity in any shape or' form. He
had made good his word. " The words
brought another cheer.
Forcing his way through the- crowd;
Mr. de Witte met the members of the
Russian mission, who rushed forward to
shake'his hands. Briefly, he "gave them
the Joyful" tidings. When, as he started
up the stairs, he said to another inquirer
who murmured the word "indemnity":
"We pay not a kopeck of indemnity,
sir; not a koDeck."
The crowd yelled uproariouslyâ all ex
cept the Japanese. \u25a0 In a group the
Japanese correspondents returned to- the
main hotel, anxiously â¢ awaiting \ news
from the Japanese' mission. I They were
keenly disappointed that * Baron :lComura
and Mr. Takahira had not > returned to
the hotel for lttncheon, .and. ; were 4 ..nn^
willing to cable "home much' about* .'the
agreement until ; the Japanese official
I statement had been received.' Until ihat
| should .come they were' un willing, to be
i lieve the "news. ... , 'â¢ \u0084
I "We shall wait until we hear from
our envoys: they will tell the whole
truth." said one of them, with ah em
phasis on the adjective.
â¢ The whole truth they learned when
j Mr Sato made the Japanese official an-
I nouncement later in , the evening. . \u25a0
i The griÂ».t Japanese demonstration did
not begin until after 6 o'clock in the even
ing, as the Japanese plenipotentiaries
I and their, official secretaries} remained at
j the yard during the afternoon. When it
[ came it was even -more remarkable than
j that of the Russians, for all present ap
j predated what sacrifice the heroic little
nation had made for peace. The crowd
which awaited the envoys as they dashed
up !n ait automobile was even larger than
that which greeted Mr. de /Witte. The
cheering came in volleys. â¢ Again and
again the crowd hurrahed and Â» waved
their hats. As the car came under the
portecochere both plenlpotentiarles.graye
ly lifted their, .hats and held them fin
their hands as they passed through the
line of cheering people to the elevator:
Baron Komura. and Mr. Ta'kah^ra
looked straight ahead and seemed almost
embarrassed by the ovations. Even the
ringing cheers .from all. sides, did not
move them. r Only the gravity of \he
day's work seenved-to impress them. -They
felt the full responsibility, which had been
upon their shouldersi > Solemnity '\u0084 was
written upon their faces as they entered
the hotel, 'and the sounds of jubilation
greeting them on every side did not ahut
out'from their eyes the home country and
the po?slble effect upon their- people of
the news of the sacrifice that had been
made for peace. Neither plenipotentiary
stepped . to shake hands, , but. ' accompa
nied by Mr. Sato," they went .immediately
to their rooms.
"I'll be back in a moment;?, said Mr.
Sato,- as the elevator took him to the -sec
ond" floor,' where 'he deposited in' Baron
Komura's room the precious records of
the day's proceedings
i ' When Mr. Sato entered the lobby; a few
minutes later with the official announce
ment,' even .the summer girls -crowded
in and pushed and fought to get on the
Inner circle. "Mr. Sato fairly*, fought Ills

to the band stand, read the' Japanese
statement in the same monotone in
which' all his previous ones have been
made. . ....
Near by. In a croup, stood the' still In

"We did not believe It this nr.ornlng."

SEATTLE. Aug. 29. â The steamship.
Centennial reached port last night after
a voyage to the mouth of the Amur
River, for which place she sailed. from
San Francisco Jane Â±2. Tho officers say
the fog and their captain's nerve saved ,
them from capture. by Japanese. Un-,
der command of Captain Strand th*
Centennial sailed from . San Francisco!
with a cargo, the - principal part of
which was salt, although shÂ© carried
some flour. It was understood by the
ship's officers that she was under char
ter to a man named Lourl. who claimed
that he was taking the cargo to a can
nery, which he owned at . Nikolalevsk.
which is some distance from the mouth \u25a0
pf the Amur.
The Centennial dropped anchor fifty
miles oft Nikolalevsk. Here she was
obliged to wait for nineteen days be
fore she could discharge her cargo and
get away.
Although the cargo of the Centennial
was said to have been shipped by a prl- .
vate party, the fact that work of dis
charging was done by Russian soldiers â¢
caused the officers and crew to have
suspicions as to whether It was for pri
vate use.
Peasants "War Ujom Tnleves.
"WARSAW. Aug. 29. â The peasants In
the surrounding districts are making
determined efforts to exterminate bands
of thieves "who have been committing
extensive depredations. On August 2S
eleven thieves were killed and fifty
wounded. The peasants are organized
to resist them, and a conflict is lmmt
nent.
Astonishment at the result was felt by
the Foreign Office. It was tho first ex
clamation of one of Russia's principal
bankers, who was expecting a different
outcome. That Russia would not hayÂ» to
pay any Indemnity was at first scarcely
believable. The Berlin Stock Exchanga
had been preparing for news of a ruptnro
of the negotiations and for consequent
disorder In the. market.
There was animation at thÂ» Russian
embassy until late to-night. The Embas
sador, Count Osten-Sacken. cad gone out
of town with the' Countess, who for a
long. time has been seriously 111. but thÂ«
staff of the embassy received callers and
their congratulations on what . from, a
diplomatic point of view seemed a
remarkable Russian success, yet Japan
was regarded as having won ail she
sought . for. even In Imagination, before
the war . was begun; as having gained
opportunities for the tranquil develop
ment of - the extensive territory on - the
mainland, and as having won a position
in respect to the "Western , great powers
that will make them, extremely civil to
her hereafter.
The Foreign Office says unreservedly
that without the President's personal ex
ertions, supported by his unique- position
and the power of the United States, peace
would ijot have been attained, and thct
Germany and thÂ® whole world will bem
flt by the statesmanship shown by thÂ«
"Washington Government. The Foreign

"WORLD'S FOREMOST FIGURE.
The Dally Graphic, commenting on
Japan's "extraordinary .magnanimity,"
considers that, "coming from a victor
ious : power on the eve *of further vic
tories, such concessions point to a higher
code of ethics than ;that which prevails
In any of the- European nations, and to
a deeper appreciation of the causes, that
make nations really, great. . Whether, her
magnanimity will prove costly In ; the
future It Is ;\u25a0 Impossible -to say, but. In
any case, Japan secures the respect of
the world and that Is an asset which
A long dispatch was received at .the
Japanese legation later in the evening and
was forwarded to Baron .Hayashl.
In all official- circles," m" the clubs and
elsewhere the announcement of the terms
came as a complete surprise,, and respon
sible persons would not express definite
opinions until more Information regard
ing them had been received, r
The morning papers, \u25a0 while sharing the
astonishment of the public <- at the un
expected nature of the peace terms, ac
cord the greatest praise , to Japan for
having chosen so magnanimous a course.
It Is contended " that, by waiving the
question of indemnity, Japan might Just
ly claim the whole^ of the island of Sag
halien and that, therefore, the return of
one-half of the island Is a concession
made entirely In the Interest of peace.
All the papers express gratitude to
President ; Roosevelt and admiration of
his untiring zeal. : giving him full credit
for_belng "the one man who made peace
possible.'/ CISBSB
English papers, which have been
strongly pro- Japanese throughout , the
negotiations, express disappointment
Japan's failure to be reimbursed for the
expenses of the war." At the same time,
several of them admit that she, perhaps,
has chosen the wiser and more business
like course. ." .>\u25a0
The Foreign Office, according to_ Sir
Eric*, had no Idea ..Â»at Japan intended
to agree on all points. It is under
stood, however, that it was well known
in official circles here that Japan was
so anxious to make a good < impression
on . the world that she was ready to
make extraordinary concessions.
Sir Eric . Barrington said the Anglo-
Japanese treaty was released by . the
announcement of the decision of the
Portsmouth conference, but that the
terms would not be given out till the
Government had been oflJclally notified
of the success of the peace conference.
Baron "Hayashi.- the Japanese Minister,
also received the first information from
the press. The Minister was at his coun
try home, where he was seen by a cor
respondent. He declined to make any
comment until he received "an official an
nouncmeent from his Government-,
The Associated" Press conveyed the
first information to the Foreign Office,
where Sir Eric Barrington, represent

pressed profound astonishment, and

COUPLE WED WHILE
SPEEDING IN AIR
WASHINGTON. Aug. 29.â News of
the agreement of the peace plenipo
tentiaries at Portsmouth was received
here with surprise, for, while the official
mind had been m a measure prepared
for a successful outcome of the confer
j ence by the statements contained in the
press dispatches from Portsmouth last
night, no such speedy action was ex
pected. Following closely upon the
press bulletins announcing the agree
ment came a message to Acting Secre
tary of State Loomis from Third Assist
ant Secretary Peirce at Portsmouth,
which consequently may bo regarded
as official, in these words:
"Russian and Japanese plenipoten
tiaries agreed on terms of peace."
Two facts appeared clearly upon the
announcement of the news: First, that
the State Department officials had never
entertained any doubt that the confer
ence \u25a0would reach an agreement; and.
second, that the militant branches of
the Government, the army and navy
people, were as fully confident that the
war would continue indefinitely and to
the point of exhaustion of one of the
combatants. â¢
Now that an agreement has been
reached, however,, both branches of
the Government service experience a
feeling of relief. The State Department
realizes a great victory In having se
cured beyond any question the open
door in Manchuria, which was so dear
to the heart of the late Secretary -Hay.
The territorial integrity of China seems
also assured, and. with the restoration
of the vast Manchurian provinces to the
present Emperor of China and the
Dowager Empress It is felt here that
there is an end for all time of insid
ious foreign aggressions upon Chinese
soil. With Korea under a Japanese
protectorate, developing its great na
tional resources, .and all opened to
American exploitation on even terms
with other nations, a large increase in
the foreign market open to our prod
ucts is expected.
- For its part, the navy will be re
lieved of the tedious and expensive
patrol which it has been maintaining
in the Philippines ever since the be
ginning of hostilities, to guard against
the violation of the neutrality of the
belligerents. Also, it will be relieved
of the necessity of guarding the Rus
sian Interned ships. These ships may
now. It is supposed, depart for their
home ports, although some repairs may
be necessary -before, they be regarded
as seaworthy.
Secretary Bonaparte expressed great
satisfaction at the news that peace
was said to be assured.
General Bates, Acting Secretary of
War, said be was delighted to learn of
the agreement at Portsmouth, especial
ly as he had begun to fear an unfavor
able outcome of the negotiations.
Acting Secretary of State Loomis said
to-night:
**A great service has been rendered
all mankind by the President. The
President 'has personally done more: to
bring about this much desired peaceful
â¢ettlement of the war in the Far East
than the world knows, or, perhaps, will
ever know. His achievement Is as
splendid as It is unique."

OTSTER BAY. Aug. 29. â Late to
night President Roosevelt received the
following telegTam from the Russian
envoys :
"PORTSMOUTH, >\ H^ Aug. 2Â». â The
President t We have the honor to In
form )ou that we have reached an
ttrwiafnt with the plenipotentiaries
â¢f Japan. To you history will award

Initiative In bringing about this con
ference, whose labors will now prob
sblj- result in establishing a peace
honorable to both sides.
"DE WITTE.
"ROSEX."
To this telegram the President sent
the following reply:
"OSTER BAY, X. V., Ang. 29 De
Wltte and Rosen, Portsmouth, X. H.â l
cannot too strongly express ray con
gratulations to you and to the entire
civilised world upon the asreement

tentiaries of Japan and upon the .fact
that thereby a peace has been secured
Juat and honorable to both sides.
â¢â¢THEODORE ROOSEVELT."
In his library at Sagamore Hill, Presi
dent Roosevelt, shortly before 1 o" clock
this afternoon, received the announcement
that ths Russian and Japanese plenipo
tentiaries at Portsmouth had reached an
agreement and would proceed at once to
conclude thÂ« terms of a treaty of peace.
The announcement was not expected to
day. The President at no time during thÂ©
negotiations pending had ceased to work
for a successful issue of the conference,
> but he had realized more clearly than
any other one man in the world the enor
mous difficulties which confronted the
envoys in their deliberations. While he
has not for a moment relaxed his earnest
efforts to- induce the conf errees to con
tinue iheir discussions with a view to
securing a basis of agreement, he had
elt for forty-eight hours that the aisk
le had set for himself in the interest of
:umacity and civilization was well nigh
hopeless.
The- President's final appeals to St.
Petersburg and to Tokio nad been made.
So response had been received from the
Orient, . but from Peterhof Palace had
come, in Emperor Nicholas' own words,
Russia's ultimatum, "not a kopeck of in
demnity, not a verst of territory."
PLAXXED A LAST EFFORT.
The situation looked black indeed. The
President, however, did not despair.
With the final terms of the Japanese
Government, as scon as they should be
received from Japan's Emperor, he had
determined to seek the aid of Emperor
William of Germany in support of his
proposition Uiat the warring powers sub
mit thtir points of difference to the ar
bitrament of an impartial tribunal.

culty ever sin-je the differences, Beeming
"/y irreconcilable, by the envoys had
arisen. To this proposition Japan had ac-
I ceded. With the powerful influence of
the German Emperor at Peterhof enlisted
It was hoped that the ground of objec
tion might be cut from beneath the feet
of Emperoc Si' holas. This was to' have
been the President's supreme effort to in
sure " a just and lasting peace."
The President's thoughts of a final
appeal were interrupted by the tinkle
of the bell of T^ie telephone on his
desk. Mr. Loc-u. secretary to the
President, who was engaged with him
&t the -moment on the peace negotia
tions, answered the call.
"What!" he eagerly exclaimed, as the
message was given him.
The message was repeated. He
manifested so much excitement end in
credulity that the President Inquired:
"What is Itf
"It is announced by the Associated
Press in an official bulletin from Ports
mouth." he replied, "that the pleni
potentiaries have agreed on all points
of difference and will proceed at once
to negotiate a treaty of peace."
"That is fine â splendid!" exclaimed
the President. "But." as a doubt passed
through his mind, "do you think it is
authoritative?"
"It is a perfectly definite statement,"
Mr. Loeb responded. y
"Good: good!" the President ex
claimed.
Official confirmation of the historic tid
ings reached the President at 2:20 o'clock
In a cipher dispatch from Portsmouth.
By authority and at the request of Baron
Komura, the chief envoy of. Japan, the
stated:
V'The plenipotentiaries of Japan have
Withdrawn their claim for reimbursement
'of war expenses and an agreement has
been reached as to the partition of the
island cf Saghalien. All main points have
been definitely settled. The plenipoten
tiaries will now proceed with the dlscuz
, sign of details."
â¢ ' PRESIDENT IS DELIGHTED.
Shortly after the receipt -of this mes
sage the full presa reports of the occur- ;
rences at Portsmouth incident to the an
nouncement of the news, including : Mr.
&c Witte's statment of the adjustment of
the difficulties by the conferrees, was re
ceived at the executive offices and carried
by < * special messenger to President
Roosevelt. He read the account with deep
interest.
While the President did not seek to
conceal his profound gratification that
the conference had"" reached an agree
ment, he said he was obliged \u25a0 In ; the cir
cumstances to refrain from any formal
expression regarding the work accomV
plishod until he should have been in
formed fully a* to details. It can be said,
however, that he feels that the successful
issue of the conference is a great triumph
for humanity and civilization. Such pub-
Uc expression as he may make regarding
*be , work of the conference will be an-
Ifgunccd after he shall have had oppor
tunity carefully to consider- it.
Throughout , this ; little wayside village,
atn'Jng. the friends ".and neighbors of the
President, his Interest in all the proceed-
, ings at Portsmouth has been keenly" ap
preciated. The news of the agreement
went through the town with magical ra
pidity. Business was suspended for a
time and the people assemoled in groups
here and there to disucss the unexpected
news.
At the conclusion of their labors in the
Washington conference, the plenipoten
tiaries of both Russia and. Japan will, be
received by President Roosevelt, either
at Sagamore Hill or at the "White House.
At that reception there probably will be
tome notable utterances.
Throughout the late afternoon and
evening, messages of congratulation by
the score poured in upon the President
from persons 'both in America and Eu
rope. The great part he has played in
bringing about the success of the con
ference and in promoting -the interests
of civilization is recognized throughout
the world, as is indicated by the cordi
ality of and the wide range covered by
the congratulatory dispatches. Nono of
these messages were made public.

, TACOMA. Aug. 25.â Five hundred shin
gle mil!* la thlÃ State have signed 'an
agreement for a shut-down cf three
months next winter with the object lof
avoiding . another complete demoraliza
tion of shingle prices. The majority of
the. mills of Whatcosn County have al-"
ready signed the agreement. "Whatcom
contains the. largest number of mills, of
any county. in the State.*. Shingle prices
are still low when cost of. production and
the growing scarcity of cedar are consid
ered. The mills of the State have been
manufacturing Bhingles eleven to twelve
months yearly, . while .the local and East
ern demands do" not require more" than
eight months' output; Several shut-downs
during the last few years and other at
tempts at combination for the regulation
of prices 'have failed to remedy, matters
because many small mills would ' persist
in running, selling their product at cost
or less to avoid bankruptcy. i
If a three months' shut-down of >at
least Â£0 per. cent of the mills in the State
can be secured as desired it will mark' a
turning point In ' the : shingle industry.
\u25a0 Surplus stocks will be consumed and
higher prices be assured. " "

Ws.lcfc.nlan Joe Kelly saw a military
looking squad of Filipinos form at the
entrance to the alley and march down
to the Chinasi&n's door in a manner
that would give credit to & body of,
regulars. He immediately blew his
â¢whistle for assistance and. crossing the
street, be stood in the entrance, thus
preventing the attack until Sergeant
Ross arrived with his squad- Wj&H
Both sices of the case were stated
to the police, and. as the Filipinos still
Insisted tnat the Chinaman was trying
to rua away frca them, the sergeant
â¢was finally obliged to detail en officer
to keep tfce peace. The Cnlnacsan
slated fee had no objection to tfce Fili
pinos staying Sa the house as long as
the oÂ£ceT was there and tiat fee would
allow each of tfce men twenty Ct-nts a
day -with which to buy their meals.
Tfce Filipinos took advantage of this
offer, so now every time the Chinaman
leaves tfce building he has an officer
on one side and a i-alf dozen Filipinos
oa tfce other. Yesterday he asked per
mission to see fcis lawyer and was ac
companied by fcis bodyg-aard. consist
ing of Patrolman Field and a fcalf
dozen Filipinos.
llt Is hoped the matter will be
straightened out to-day and the China
nea, as well as the Filipinos, will re
ceive their money.
There is another who is anxiously
looking for fcis money and is also
standing his watch In the Chinaman's
den. He says he is a dealer on Du
pont etreet and furnishes the Filipinos
with clothes upon an order from the
Cfcinarnan.
The Alaska Packers' Association has
had a great deal of trouble with -its
cub-contracts and it is stated that the
wording of its contracts is such as to
â¢work tfcese fcardships. Lees than two
years ago tfce same thing happened
and eever&l fcundred> white men were
turned loose !n the city streets with
out Â£oo<s or shelter.
' The unsuspecting Cfclnaman ventured
from the house and was Immediately
stopped by one of his former employes,
who demanded money and something to
eat. Tfce Chinaman gave him ten
eer.ts and told fcim that would buy his
<Jlnner and immediately returned to his
<Ten, snd, scenting trouble, Â«ent for
comÂ« of fcis friends to come and assist
cina.
WATCHMAX ACTS PROMPTLY.
He-was not allowed to remain there
long, however, unnoticed by the Filipinos.
fcr they had formed themselves into a
secret tgency. asd so well were their
.p&ass formed teat the poor Chlcaraan was
captured the first time he left his hiding
place. . /Vj .
â¢ It had been previously arranged that
whoever should see the Chinaman . first
cr.cuid give the sigaal to tfce man at
the next corner, who In. turn should
notify the full force while the first man
was to follow him to his abode.
The Chinaman, not being able to raise
isoney acd knowing the feelings of the
little .brown men whom he had landed
here without money and with no place
where they could eat or sleep, took him-
Gclf Into seclusion in the remotest part
cf Chinatown.
- A pitched battle between twenty-nine
angry Filipinos a^d a crowd of Chinese
highbircers was narrowly averted early
yesterday zzcrz'.zg by the prompt action
cf Sergeant W. M. P.oss end his Chtoi
icwn Â£Quad.
The' FiUpinos were heavily armed with
knives and were ready to take the place
by fore*, while in a den in the second
Â«iory of 15 SpofTcrd alley were the hiÂ£h
fcTncers, who were prepared for the at
tack.
* 'Tfce Fiiirisos were contract laborers
\u25a0under a sub-ccntract from the Alaska
Packers" Association to So Ho On. and
arrived In this city August 22 on the ship
,L. .J. Morse from Cooks Inlet, Alaska.
Vri6.tr their contract they received J35
each as advance meney before they left
this city March 2 last, and were to re
ceive I'J?S each upon their return.
So Ho On was the unlucky contractor.
and did not kcow.that there was a clause
"in the contract wnl?h prevented him from
getting his nsoncy in case the cannery
<hc-Jld burn down. He furnished to the
association ninety-five men. of whom
sixty-five were Chinamen, and to tach
cf these he had given not less than $!â¢Â»
Advance money, which caused him to
overdraw his account mere than J2XK).
According to his 'contract he was to
jM&"k 25.0-* cases cf salmon, but after he
had packed 33,235 cases the factory burned
cows and the packlr.g association claimed

The car" was : coming down' the hill on
Beilevue avenue, at a.' tremendous rate
of speed, according, to eye-witnesses, and
when the motorman applied the 'air
brake it failed to, work. The hand brake
could not. be ; operated quickly enough
and the motorman lost control of , the
car. When it reached the turn at San

the track, but the strain "was so great
that the bolts were broken, the bodyof
the car leaping into the street and turn
ing over.
When the car left the trucks it struck
a mall wagon., throwing the driver," W.
E. Sanders, to the ground. He was
taken to the Receiving Hospital. : The
injured were quickly taken to the hos

attention. | ' -'â¢ '
The. passengers on. the car. say they
noticed when 1 the car^was running.down
the hill that the motorman was. having
difficulty with the brakes, but did * not
realize' that a serious accident was im
pending. The trolley, it is said, slipped
.from the wire on the hill, making it Im

At length the canoe " becomes, old. moss
grown, and rotten, and the Creator determines
to secure come better abiding place.
; . While the Coyote sleeps he combs out from
his own' body a ma6S of hair, forms it Into a
flat disk, sets it afloat on the. water and pn It
places what are to be trees, plants., etc. â¢ .
The' world Is thus "created and. the. canoe
floats gently ashore, when the Creator arouses
Coyote, who wakes to find himself overshad
owed by drooping branches of fruit. The' two

1 would like to call your attention to what
U being dent In &ntfcnji>olcgy particularly in
the United States end es'x;cia!ly in relation
to this department oi the State University.
We know that in South America at least con
siderable is being don*, particularly in Ar-
Kvntina, and also in Chile. In P.-ru about all
that lias been done has l>een dune by toreiga
ers. Whtn we ccme to Central America the
t'overnmenis and individuals have dons little.
In Mextco the Government has takt-n an In
terest in the archaeology and ethnology and
has caused the publication cf many very im
portant volumes. In the Uniu-d States there
are several gcod centers of research. Here, this
df-partment was founded through the interest
\u25a0of Mrs. Kearst in the development of anthro
pology. At first Mr?. Hearst was gathering ma
terial for the State I'niverslty during her
travels. " Wherever she went siie sent home
object* of archaeology, ethnology and of art.
Kiral'y sh* saw that in order to carry on the
work in a rrcjx^r manner to give the best re
suits it would be necessary to organize regu
lar expeditions, and to she organized an ex
pedition for exploring In Egypt, and
you . have tn this ; hall the - begin
ning of the unpacking' of th- results of
that Egyptian txpedition. Dr. Reisner has
been In charge cf that expedition for .four
jears. Then Mrs. Hcar3t organized an ex
pedition to Peru und-r the direction of- Dr.
Uhle. and he . has been engaged now for six
years, on that exploration. She also sent ex
peditions into the classical lar.ds. j â¢
Here on the Pacific Ccast.not only do we
have this cpportur.f:y to explore for the an
tlquity of nian. but we have the unexampled
opportunity for the study of languages, and
how It cane about that so many languages
were recorded- in this State, the localities of
th^ "people. The "rites and customs and cere
monies and Institutions of all these different
peoples. Here we are ripht en the Pacific and
th'- islands before us. We want to study th-?'
jw^ple of the islands. What better opportunity
than having California as the placVtrorn which
wiil reach the investigations Xrpm these differ
ent irlands. Then th? chores of Asia. 'Is it
true .tiiat the people first catnefrcm Asia to,

Asia? How came the people on the Canary

TELLS OF WORK ACHIEVED.
This Is the first time that the American As
sociation of Anthropology has met on the Pa
cific Coast, and in my capacity in charge of
this building I vrelcome you here most heartily.
The association, as you know, is really Aroer.
can in the broadest ser.se. We have members
Irora various countries in South America, frum
Mexico, and from the Dominion of Canada,
co that we cover the whole continent â¢ol
America. \VÂ« have at present with us at least
two members from Canada, and I wish I
rr.igrfct say from Mexico and South America,
bui we have letters of resretthat our mem
bers there will be unable to be -present. The
objects of our association it ts worth while to
consider at every one of our meetings.
As we all known anthropology is a very
broad subject. It takes in the beginnings at
can. when man first appeared upon th-j earth,
the history of -man in other, times, the distri
bution of man over thÂ» parth, and all that
xr.an has dene through the medium of his
hands. Our study t-mbrares man and all that
man has done. We would have saved many
end many a blunder if we had only taken up
the primitive ideas and developed them In
stead cf starting- out anew in our various en
terprises, not thinking about what had bÂ«en
flone before. ThÂ»re is where our govern
ments are making a great mistake in dealing
\u25a0with the Philippine peoples. They do not un
derstand the life of the people; they tread
upon their customs ana the most sacred
thoughts, and then they wonder why It Js
that the people rise. We know what the
treatment cf this Government has been to th*
Indians and we ere on the verge of dolns
th' same with the Filipinos. Now it Is a
question whether our Government will take
warning and treat the people in the Phllipp'n-s
in the proper manner cr whether they will go
en and have another century of dishonor. And
it is for us to guide ard direct that work.

BERKELEY, Aug. 29.-Despite declara
tions made by School Directors Weir and
Knowles at the meeting of the Town
Trustees last night that- unless more
money is forthcoming for the schools of
Berkeley the full year's course cannot be
carried out.- the Trustees declined to
amend the appropriation made last week
for the School Department's maintenance.
The Trustees listened to an exhaustive
presentation of the School Board's argu
ments and then voted to divide the 25
cent appropriation in. a slightly different
fashion than previously ordered. The
high school will get IS cents of the 25.
Instead of 17, and the grammar schools
will get 7 cents, instead of 8, cents. That
was all the relief the Trustees granted
the School Directors.
The Town Trustees created a precedent
wTTen they appointed E. L. Cory ell, one
of the most prominent realty operators in
Berkeley, to the position of poundmaster.
Mr. Coryell is president of the local
branch of the Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Animals. He will engage
an assistant to do the actual work of the
office.
â¢ The National Surety Company, which is
on Town Treasurer Lord's bond, asked
the Trustees to provide an audit of the
Treasurer's books, the books not having
been- approved for four years, ' according
to the surety company's letter to the
Trnetees. The matter was referred to tre
-Finance Committee,
Complaint was made by a delegation of
West Berkeley citizens against . a big

about 200 of these grains. The results of
the .tests will not be divulged by Pro
fessor Shaw until his report is made in

The Arnautka variety, tnerefore, may
be .recommended by Professor Shaw as
one grain which appears to retain its

BERKELEY, Aug. 29.â Professor George
W. Shaw of the agricultural department
of the university, who is in charge of the
"gluten in wheat" experiments now being
conducted, returned to-day from Yuba
City, where an agricultural station is
maintained by the University. He brought
with him specimens of wheat, of foreign
varieties, grown at the station under the
direction of his assistants, which are ex
pected to shed a great deal of valuable
light on a perplexing problem, namely,
the question of what effect the. California
climate and soil have on different varieties
of wheat, as regards the retention of
gluten. .\u25a0-\u25a0/ '. I'j _.. : ;_\u25a0 '\u25a0 ;:\u25a0%â¢; 'V*-.-: .*-.;.. '.'

50i1..-- Professor -Shaw has. found that; of
three varieties -of foreign wheat which
have been grown at- the Yuba City, ex

hardness or gluten of the original seed.
This is the Arriautka variety/ jThe Cool

_The Kubanka, also a Russian variety,
softens most of all,! 99 per cent of the

OAKLAND, Aug. 2.-Otto L. Hasse,

county.. His bond was fixed at $2000, and
not 'till a late hour did J. J. Burke, his
attorney, secure bondsmen. , They are

The indictment is / the result of the
charge made against" Hasse of having
stuffed the county stationery bills to cov

The frauds perpetrated in regard to the
charging for stuff never ordered or re

so palpable that the Supervisors cut the

" OAKLAND, Aug. 29.-^The photograph
of the late Nelson Bump, with thirty-two
of his Immediate" family grouped about
him, was introduced in evidence to-day
in the trial of the contest now being
waged over his will, in which he practi
cally disinherited his widow and left his
estate, valued at $G5,000, to his four
daughters hy his first wife.
â¢ The picture was introduced to show
Bump's physical appearance at a family
reunion at the Bump home on Merritt
Island in the Sacramento River, subse
quent, to the nvikins of the will. There
is little likelihood of the Bump blood run
ning out, and the group shows an un
usual family.
Bump had but four daughters, two of
which arÂ»Â» seated on either side of him.
Each of them is a grandmother. Beside
them sit their married children, while the
other* are ranged behind them. The row
cf little tots in the front are the great
grandchildren of Bump. These thirty-two
contestants are immediately interested in
the outcome of the suit and are arrayed
against the lone widow, who lived with
Bump for twenty years.
To-day Lewis Albert Melrose was on
the stand and testified that he often
played cards with Bump and that the
deceased would forget the game they
were playing. The case is stringing out
so long that Judge Ogden stated that
after to-day the trial would go on at
night.

near Honolulu, in complete working or
der Inside of a. 1 few months.* The offi
cers of the company feel corffldent of
their ability to make "the wireless plant
a complete success in every way.' It is
believed that It wUI be possible to com
municate with all the wireless equipped
vessels .within a radius of 2000 or more

the Oriental and 'Australian mail steam
ships will be equipped with wireless
telegraph apparatus, and that on these
ships a daily newspaper of a few pages
containing the condensed doing of the
world furnished from the Tamalpais
station will be published.'
The station will consist of two high
towers with a building for the ma
chinery and use of the employes: at
the station for dwelling purposes.
Each tower will be 300 feet high and
four feet square at the- top. The dis
tance between: the two towers will be
100 feet. The first 100 feet of the tow

stronger than a solid piece of the same

COLMA, Aug. 29.â Preparations are be

ments. The main thoroughfare of the
town is to be practically rebuilt, the rail
road tracks arÂ» to bÂ« raised throughout
the entire' length of the town and proper
drainage is to be provided and grades
changed. These changes have long been
needed, but the various interests involved
were slow to agree upon a united action.
The Southern Pacific Company win raise
its tracks from the county line through
the town, so that the county may provide
adequate drainage and obviate the muddy
roads- of winter. The road at Daly3 Hill
will be lowered between four and five
feet, and It is probable that electric lights
will be established.

San Francisco." namely, the title Insurance.
All lawyers should study the operations, for
by \u25a0 . the wording " of \u25a0- the - contracts everything
that one wants . to Insure is stricken from the
policy by a. careful construction, and deceit : ls
a pitfall for. the unwise. . This Js the most co
lossal system of graft .existing and one which
airstudents should help eradicate- by ferreting
out- the offenders. ' - -
\ln .'conclusion, get enthusiastic about your
work. Don't think the profession is a money
making scheme, for It is not a royal rood to
wealth. Depend for gain upon the moral as
pects of; the : profession \u25a0 and b# an avenger of
human wrongs, as an attorney has been right-
. The enthusiasm of the classroom is desirable
for success . In the : learning of law, and this
can be obtained when the students are assem
bled and feel they are working for a common
purpose. ' The ;\u25a0 books will start with Blackstone
and the elective system of case study will giva
you a course that will be a great â¢ development.
Learn the law as you will afterward practice It â
by 'the case system. - that Is, study the inter
esting points of issues â and Impress them on
your mind. Get familiar with the> codes, for
codification Is the synopsis' of thÂ« polnta In
law. Apply yourself to the codes of California,
especially, during the last year of your course,
and thus eliminate the teraous. forgetful war
of depending on the - textbook and lecture
method of teaching and leaving the actual prac
tice to be acquired In later years.

- Possibly It will not do ' any - harm to ' call
your attention to the abuses in this State that
are engaging the notice of barristers of Intel

The feature of abuse that Is most prominent In
San Francisco is. the professional Jury system
and It seems to affect this city greatly. It
has created much talk among the bar as to
the way to rid the law of it. The last Legis
lature passed the antl-professlonal jury bill
without attracting: the attention of the people
until it '\u25a0 came to the Governor to sign. . Then
came protests. ; as the provisions 1 made It an
expense to other counties, while* this one â the
one affected â would reap the benefits."-;.-:
there -la no branch of commercial . activity

business men need a knowledge of more than

When the little boy whimperingly ac
knowledged that he was one of a crowd
of little boys who threw stones at upright
citizens, his mother comforted him by
saying, "Don't cry, ,' Arty;, the Judge, will
dismiss you because none of the other,
boys ware arrested. He wouldn't be so
unjust as to punish you alone."
His Honor tried to elucidate the illogi
cality of the lady's reasoning/ but " she
scoffed at hia words. ;
"Now. wouldn't it be a nice thing," she
sarcastically. rejoined, "to punish my boy
while others, equally guilty, are not pun- r
lshed at all?" \u0084-
"But the other boys escaped arrest,"
said the Judge. Â»â¢ â¢'â¢
"What difference does that make, I'd
like to know. ' Is that any reason why
my son . should be fined or sent to Jail?
Why don't you punish the policeman that

"He : couldn't catch them."
"Well, who is to blame f or . that ? Is

"No; I do not. . How should I know?V

"Besides," added the policeman, "your

"If my dogs, "Mr. Dell is reported . to
have said,^"chase the bums out of the

"Judge, John F. Davis, the State's Code
Commissioner, delivered an address at
the opening of the Young Men's Christian
Association evening law school last night.
He described , it as" a "heart to heart
talk," intended to inspire the young stu
dents to enter the course with a zest and
greater respect, for the work undertaken.
Judge Davis praised the management
of the school for placing such admirable
advantages as.lt offers before the youth
of San Francisco. Many instances were
cited by the speaker of men who have
risen^high in. their line by application to
books in the hours most people use for
recreation .or sleep. - He gave . reminis
cences from' his" own and other attorneys'
beginnings, and told how several Presi
dents of the United States gained their
education through â¢- self-Instruction and
nfght study."
-James A. Ballentine, dean of the even
ing law t school, introduced Judge Davis to
the assemblage" and expressed thanks in
behalf ; of the .' school for being honored
by one so high in thY profession at the
opening of the fifth year of study. He
announced that the actual study will be
gin sTuesday evening, and the students
entering the course may register, at any
time before - then. The following Is a
synopsis of the excellent^ address deliv

John O'Brien, a shock-haired resident
of Palo Alto, was In: a walking trance
last Saturday ; when ; Patrolman Holmes
arrested him on Kearny street, and when
arraigned - before . Judge Mogan i yesterday
morning he askedto.be dismissed. -as he
desired ' to . spend last \u25a0' Sunday with his
family. Then: the policeman. ' glancing
knowingly at: the. Judge/ tapped on his
brow with an index â¢ finger : and with the

around his head, thus conveying Intima
tion that the; defendant was demented.
"Howdidiit happen ?", his Honor.asked.

the patrolman. . "Three drinks stops time,
four reverses the hands , of the clock and
five turns everything >lse^ backward. This

to-morrow will : be Sunday. Time has
ceased 'moving for him.";
Mr. Volkman pleaded that his show of
hostility was merely to frighten the boys,
who, he averred, had been in the habit of
annoying him. ' That his pursuer's mien
must have been terrifying was opined by
Master Katz, who told the Judge that the
woman at the window shouted, "Don't

dead away."
Policemen w*re sent forth to seek the

Henry Katz and another boy past her
domicile. Judge Conlan then continued
till \u25a0 next Friday the case of Mr. Volk
man. accused by Master Katz of having
exhibited deadly weapons In rude and
threatening manner.
"They fought like wildcats," said the
officer, "and a crowd of boys encouraged
them." ''\u25a0-â
"What was the cause of the combat?"
his Honor Inquired.
"Oh. they belong .to a boxing club and
are always ready with a wallop." was
the enlightening reply.
"These amateur boxing clubs and exhi
bitions are not helping the boys of San
Francisco to become gentlemen," said the
Judge. "While glove practice is excel
lent physical exercise,- It also tends to
Inspire the Juvenile practitioners with
pugnacity, and their 'readiness with \u25a0 a
wallop' Is ~ reirponsible for many unpro-"
yoked assaults."
The two would-be Britts were dismissed
with a reprimand.
Judge Fritz deplored the Influence of
the amateur boxing clubs and exhibitions
upon the youthful mind, his remarks be
ing prompted by Patrolman Nolan's
thrilling description of a "scrap" between
Willie Bourne and Amos Gonzales. work
ing lads, at Fourth and Clementina
streets. - '-â¢ - r: :-
There is not a more courageous member
of the force than that same Nolan. But
police uniforms cost money, and removal
of paint stains leaves instead an odor of
gasoline which no fastidious peace guard
ian desires to inhale, much less to rad
iate. And when both suasion and threat
failed to stay the conflict, didn't Patrol
man Nolan Intrepidly rush in and disarm
the Infuriated duelists, to his own sar
torial disfigurement?
Police Judge Alogan's effort to ascer
tain who opened the fray was not en
tirely successful. From the statements of
the defendants, both of whom are
journeymen house decorators, the infor
mation, was derived that either Mr.
O'Malley playfully splashed a few drops
of vermilion on Mr. Roach or Mr. RosÂ»ch
jocularly sprinkled some blue on VÂ£r.
O'Malley; that the recipient of the
shower retaliated in kind; that the ex
change of paint was repeated, and that
the mutual spirit of . good humor was
gradually supplanted by mutual malicious
desire to seriously damage.
When arrested and held at arm's
length by Patrolman Nolan both Mr.
O'Malley and Mr. Roach were, to quote
the descriptive words of a witness,
"sights to behold." And as they stood
before the Judge they were studies In
the Impressionist, j
It having been made evident that the
defendants Injured nobody except each
otherâ unless the faint tinge of turpen
tine emitted by the policeman could b*Â»
designated injuriousâ they were dismissed

Were his clean and handsome dogs as
much of a public eyesore, Mr. Dell de
manded to know, as the professional
vagabonds who straddled the benches
and sprawled upon the sward?' To these
queries the policeman replied, that the
question at issue was not one involving
the comparative cleanliness â¢ of certain
dogs and certain men, but one concern-
For airing his dogs in Union Square
and declining to remove them, Leon Dell,
keeper .of a Post-street lodging- houÃe,
will be sentenced to-day by Judge Fritz.
Patrolman McQuaid, who arrested Mr.
Dell, testified that his authority was ab
solutely, set at defiance by the defendant.
When told to take his canines elsewhere
and never again lead them within the
boundaries of the city's central breathing
spot Mr. Dell inquired why his quad
rupeds were not entitled to a privilege
enjoyed by human bipeds who were their
inferior in all phases of attractive
ness. . ' '
About half ian hour later Mrs. McCar
thy was astonished when she returned
from the corner grocery to meet James
Feuwick emerging from his apartment
with a valise in his hand and evident ap
prehension in his manner. She f ervently
rxpressed a' hope that nobody had awak
ened him, and he was stammering a re
ply when from the closed valise there
emanated the muffled whirr of an alarm
clock, and instantly a great light burst
on Mrs. McCarthy's intelligence. She was
being robbed. '
In the valise were discovered, besides
the alarm clock, a soap dish and a cake
pt soap, some towels and several articles
of bric-a-brac, all belonging to Mrs. Mc-
Carthy. Judge Fritz sent Mr. Fenwick to
the Superior Court, with bail fixed at
$2000. . â¢ ; "
James Fenwick said he was over
worked and "'dog_tired" when he rented
a room in the home of Mrs. McCarthy, at
the Potrero. and ere retiring to the cham
ber he requested her to see to it that he
was not disturbed for at least twelve
hours from that moment, as he was fam
ishing for sound and uninterrupted slum
ber. â¢
But the attorneys' table intermittently
continued to ventilate possibilities of the

AFTER all, the proposition made by President Roosevelt to
arbitrate the value of one-half of Saghalien Island has been
accepted and peace is declared between Japan and Russia.
This result was foreshadowed in The Call's discussion of probabil
ities at the meeting of the envoys. Japan secures commercial ad
vantages in the suzerainty of Korea and Russia's' evacuation '\u25a0 of
Manchuria, and in the possession of the railroad and the practical
control of Port Arthur and Dalny and ownership of half of Sagha
lien, of more permanent importance than a war indemnity.
Let us hope that with this conclusion the world has seen its
last great war. -'-'-. ' : ."
PEACE AT LAST.
PERHAPS the public authorities are too much occupied in pre
venting, violation of the game laws in respect to big game.
All along our rivers and on the marsh lands that border them
numerous waterfowl nest and hatch their young in the summer,
for it is a mistake to suppose that all of the ducks fly far north
ward in the spring, to return reinforced by their young in the fall.
The mallards, especially, stay with us in considerable numbers
and live in the moist sedges of our streams and ponds, and rear
numerous young. These "floppers," "as the young mallards 'are
called, are now being slaughtered in great quantities by sneaking
gunners. They are half grown, cannot yet rise for a flight, and are
killed as they flop on the water with their immature wings. This is
odious to a real sportsman. It gives the bird no chance at all,
and it is a particularly mean violation of the game law. The ducks
* should never be shot on their breeding waters, even in the open
season. It is wise to encourage them to stay and breed on our
own waters, for when they are hunted as these floppers are they
avoid our waters.
The same kind -of "sportsmen" ' who are killing these youug
mallards are seining the black bass out of our streams. The bass
is a game fish and a fine one. The law forbids taking it with a
seine. It is a fish to be taken with the hook only, and next to the
trout it is the best fish taken in that way. As well permit the sein
ing of trout as bass. The day may come when the big game of the
forest will disappear, no matter how carefully protected by law;
clearing the land does the work for elk and deer, which cannot exist
without cover. But it is possible to protect waterfowl and game
fish and have always a reasonable supply.
The shooting of floppers and the seining of black bass should
be punished to the extent of the law. It is said that the. temptation
to shoot, the young ducks is furnished by the offer of high prices
for them by private parties, not dealers, in this city, who want
them for their own tables. Luxury of that kind is criminal and
those who indulge in it should be ashamed of themselves. 7

between Russia and Japan was made by a Call bulletin at 941
yesterday morning â six minutes before the news was posted by
the Examiner and ten minutes before the Chronicle. .This is but
one more evidence of the many recently given that The Call's ar
rangements to obtain the news are superior to those of its con
temporaries. It has been enabled to bulletin ahead of its .contem
poraries in this city every great news event for a long time past.

opinionated; so It. was but natural
when he s found himself sitting next to a
modest-appearing, quiet man that . ho
should enter into a conversation. After
a bit the conversation drifted todfsc'ua
sion of a popular book.
"Have you read 'The Unartificlal Exist
ence'? the young man asked.
His companion said that he had.
"Well, then," the young man contin
ued. "I suppose you would agree with me
in considering it very largely a mass oÂ£
flubdub and nonsense?"
â¢ "I should hardly wish to admit that
much," was the response. - ;
"Oh, well; then you probably have not
read It so carefully as I have. Of course,
there are a few undeniable truths In the
bookâ there are. certain to be even In the
Veriest hodgepodge of claptrap. Don't
you think so?"
"I suppose that the fact would be un
deniable."
"â¢â¢Of course, it is. But while this much
may be said for the book, as for any
other, it is' no less true that its premises
in general are unsound and its conclu
sions unsatisfactory. The vogue of the
author is a mere temporary fad. He has
accidentally risen to th.c top, and there
he will remain for a. moment and then
drop off into the oblivion where he be
longs. Don't you think. so?"
"Well, I hardly feel competent to de
cide." \u25a0
"Why 'not?"
"I fear that I may be prejudiced.";-; ;
"Why so?"
"Well, you see, I am the author of the
book." â¢>*"'
Pretty soon the young man said he must
get a drinkiOf water. Then he went for
the water, but he never came back. In
stead, he took another seat, and there
hft sat and thoughtâ and thought.
' But the modest-appearing, quiet man
only smiled to himself.' -
Moralâ Before you fully uncork your
self find out who is present.
THE YOUXG MAX O.V THE THALV.
THE young man on the train was ge
nial, loquacious and somewhat self-
tioner inquired.
"Becauseâ woe Is me! â there does
not appear to be anything wrong with
his vermiform "appendix, and so I can
not operate on him."
"Still you must not give up hope,"
was the soothing response. "You still
must operate."
"Why so? For what reason?"
"Why, to ascertain if you are not
mistaken in thfnklng that there is
nothing wrong there."
So the young physician went away
as one , In whose breast a new, bright
star of hope has risen. -7 ;

THIS is the story of a man, a sfrake,
a grasshopper and a fish; but it
is not a fish story, says the Den-
ver Times. At any rate, James
Laughlin, day manager of the Watrous
cafe, who tells the story, declares it to
be a solemn fact.
Did Laughlin ever lie?
He never had.
Therefore this story must be true.
He says:
v "I felt in need of a little rest and a
few days ago went up to Routt County.
I finally ended up at a point abou^t 50
miles north of Arrow Head at the shore
of a little lake by a mill.
"I was tired and sat down to rest.
While I sat there I saw something
moving in the grass quite near me. .1
watched closely, and there gliding
quietly down "toward the water was a
snake. How big? Oh, about six feet
long. Yep. Funniest looking snake I
ever saw.- .
" "I thought I'd watch the creature, al
though I'm not . fond of snakes, you
know. â¢ - â¢.. :;\u25a0 - . .-{' . \u25a0-
"Well, the snake paused and May very
quiet. I wondered what the game
could be. Suddenly it gave a. swish of
its tail and to my. astonishment caught
in the curved bit of bony -substance at
the end of its tail a grasshopper. Then
it started down toward the Jake again.
I confess I was puzzled, for how could
that snake eat a grasshopper with. lts
tall?
"When the snake reached the water
he turned around and slipped back
ward until nothing but his head was
on the ground. I can tell you I was
interested, for I thought this must be
a snake which was going in for. some
kind of a reform movement, giving
grasshoppers baths, maybe. : .
"Suddenly the snake turned a somer
sault and came bouncing out into the
grass, too near to me to be exactly
agreeable, and what do you think?
With the grasshopper as bait, he had
caught a sunflsh with his tail! .
'"What? Why the durn snake ate it,
of course!" -.\u25a0\u25a0 . . . .
Now-*this. was told by, Mr. 'Laughlin,
and all who. hear It will know it to be
so. \u25a0 \u25a0\u25a0â¢ ... .7 .".,..\u25a0\u25a0
'Tis' a tale worth the telling, and
Mr. Laugh lin has told it merrily and
oft. There may be some pessimists and
cynics who have given it ready; ear,
but with curling lip and, distended nos
tril, and who c'en have observed that
the refreshments should be on the Wat
rous cafe's day manager.
And then the Laughlln countenance
grows set and purple as he stoutly
points to his past reputation for vera
city..... '(<\u25a0;-\u25a0. .. . ;.; . . . â¢â¢;\u25a0

THE NEW POSTAL AND COURT BUILDING.
nnHE late Dr. Gwin during his service as Senator from California
I did great practical work for the State by founding the. Mare
1 Island Navy Yard, the Sub-Treasury and the Mint. These
Government affairs were by his effort permanently located. The
buildings to house such of them as are in San Francisco have run
from fair to indifferent. The Sub-Treasury is a marvel of incon
venience. The Postoffice and Custom-house have, long been lodged
:n an ancient ruin. The Federal courts have shared an unsightly
brick warehouse with the Appraisers of Customs, the Internal Reve
nue establishment, and numerous other branches of the Federal
service. The Mint building has long been the only Federal struc
ture in the city that could lay any claim to architectural fitness and
dignity.
Strangers have been astonished at the ignoble features of the.
public .buildings maintained in this city by the Federal Government.
California has been such a heavy contributor to the public revenues
of the nation and so little had, been spent here by the Government
in proper buildings that the subject was a sore one for all of our
people, who believed that public buildings should in some degree
approach in nobility of architecture the structures reared by private
enterprise. This feeling led to a movement, initiated about twenty
years ago, for the erection of a building to shelter the Postoffice
and the Federal courts. This would release room in the old build
ings that wai badly needed by the Custom-house to accommodate
the rapidly expanding foreign trade of the city. This movement,
hampered by sectional views as to the location of the new building,
and ; by rival real estate interests, and finally by venomous misrep
resentations that have not yet ceased, going slowly, at times and
then at better speed until a new obstacle appeared, has at last cul
minated in the completion of the building. Yesterday it was cere
monially devoted to its purposes by representatives of the commer
cial organizations of the city and State. To-day it is the busy
scene of the various official activities for which it was built, and a
new public center is established in the line of the city's growth.
v If a comparison were made between what is now, in buildings,
trade and movement of the center of population, and twenty years
ago, there would be disclosed evidence of the rapid growth and
progress of San Francisco. To-day there is more movement on
Mission street than there was twenty years ago on Market. To
day Seventh street is a busier thoroughfare than Third,, street was
when the movement for the new Postoffice began. The tide is
already surging rapidly past the new building, and the promise and
prospect of our growth give the assurance that twenty years from
now the new Postoffice will be as far "down town" as the old one
is to-day.
These facts and estimates show that the Government planned
wisely when it located the building. The city could expand no
farther northward nor eastward. If it grew at all it must go west
ward. The Government had experience in Xew York City. The
postoffice on Broadway and Ann street was once supposed to be
on the northern limit. But it was overlooked that the only growth
of the city must be to the north. Now the postoffice is relocated
away up town, and probably in a few years will have to be moved
again still farther north.
San Francisco's new postal and judicial building makes up. for
the long years of waiting for something better than the insufficient
and unsightly structures which it replaces. â¢In its exterior and in
terior it is an expression of the highest art in architecture. We
inter no local judgment, influenced by local pride and patriotism,
but that of the best judges, in saying that the building is second
only to the new Congressional Library in Washington. ; That build
ing is acknowledged to be one of the finest in the world. From
this it will be seen that the Government has compensated for long
neglect by providing for itself in San Francisco a structure which
any capital in the world would be proud to possess. It immediately
becomes a scenic feature, one which may be shown to strangers
among our crown jewels. It teaches and exhorts private enterprise
in building. It strikes % a note that is needed in our future public
and private architecture, and will be long a leading element in the
inspiration to build beautifully and well. It is a fit accompaniment
to our charms of climate and many physical attractions, and will
be to San Francisco what the cathedrals are to Cologne, Strasbourg
and Milan, the Taj to Agra and the Congressional Library to
Washington City.
It was well that our commercial bodies honored this poem in
building material, that is not only poem but music, in its harmo
nious beauty. Â£/&

I LOVE the self -assertive dunce,:
The gentle, talkful.'yawpful ass.
Who does explanatory stunts,
When evenings ati the play you pass.
He cits behind you quite benign.
And ne\ ; er can the chance resist
To drool his prattle asinine
So all the audience, must list.
To please his girlâ sweet thing in red-
He opes his echo-haunted head, ._ 'â¢..,.

To prove his thinker is small boreâ ,
Always of what all knew before. {*Â».
You've heard the cuss? Then list to this.
And see how much his rant I miss:
"That there Is Hamlick.

So drools he on, his girl to snow
How much of dramas he doth know.
Till thus I muse, to frenzy wrought:
"Two souls without a single thoughtl"
I love this I'll-inform-you ass,
And so do you â of course you do.
We dote on himâ but let it pass.
Because, you know, it Isn't true.
We think we'll see a play so old

He sits behind us in his chair,
And, oh. the"girlin red is there.
He ope 3 his mouth and yawps and drools,

This prince of dunces and of fools.
We lose* the play, its point we miss.

WHEN, a few months ago, 'an
Oakland business man brought
home a fair bride from the
southern part of the State, it was tak
en for granted that she had been cap
tured in the ordinary course of a lov
er's quest, and beyond the first greet
ings by the groom's j near friends, the
event made scarcely a perceptible rip
ple on the surface of Oakland society.
The vacation season, however,
brought' together acquaintances of the
two 1 contracting parties, . and the ro
mantic and spectacular nature of their
brief courtship was thus made known.
It happened, according- to this r vaca
tion gossip, that the Oakland man was
one day touring in his automobile when
he bethought â¢ him of a friend in Los
Angeles, and straightway he. ordered
his mail sent hither, and turned 'the
two glittering eyes of his red charger
toward that city. Â« . -
And lo! on the evening of the second
day he was there. With a final snort
the steed was brought to a standstill
in front of the. postoffice and the
knight errant joined the crowd who
had come to get their mail.
In the meantime two 'damsels had
\u25a0watched the stranger approach and
alight, and were now halted in front
of the postoffice inspecting the strange
machine. -
"May we not get in?" said one of
them. '.
"You dare not." said the other.
Upon this the first maiden stepped
into the contrivance without hesitation
and sat down on the front seat. So
that when the knight came out, his
head bent low that he' might read in
the dimness of the electric light the
letter which be had received, he had
seated himself and had almost released
his steed before he discovered the fair
one ar his side.
"By my goggles!" quoth he, as he
beheld the winsome creature, "thou
art passing fair, and hast many a
swain among these folk. 9 trow; but
come with me for a spell and I will
take thee on the wings of the wind
about this fair old town of thine."
And she being nothing loth, they
sped away, she pointing out to him the
places of interest.
On two points only would she not en
lighten him â her name and the place
of her father's abode. And so, though
st! * t! -â¢ ::: cw..-.--:,. ... . -'-\u25a0 \u25a0 ;
he^ fain would have taken her to her
own gateway, \he was compelled" J, to
leave her at the ;; \u25a0postoffice|^step
whence she \u25a0 had
sallied forth, he
waiting while
she " might ; repent
and allow him to
escort her . home.;
\u25a0 ...-; She, howeVer.
by. the aid of,' a
convenient door,
was well on \ her
way -\u25a0 homeward
when : the- knight
decided to, give
up the quest ; and
set out to wflnd
the friend whom
he came to visit.
They clasped
glad - hands jg and
ate and supped
together; and as
the man of the
world fared forth
on the morrow he
promised to re
turn' 1 at no dis
tant . date and
stand up as best
man at the wed
ding of his friend.
And impatient
ly did he wait
for that time to
come; and j right
gladly did he set
out when at last
the appointed day
arrived. And- full
well pleased was
he when he , saw
among the wed
ding, guests the
lady fair of his
dreams by night
and by day. .
They were in
troduced to.- qach

manner â¢of , the
best social usage,
and - after the
ceremonies of the
day. were over
they sped up' and
down the streets in: his automobile,

wonder 'and surmise.'

SHE SAT DOWN.All morning long a force of Janitors had
been preparing the great building for its
efteraoon reception. They had carefully
tleaned the white-marbled halls and mo
eaiced arches. The tons of heavy brass-
Viork shone resplendent from faithful
polishing. Postmaster Fisk was there to
superintend the work, and he did not de
sist until every speck of dirt and stain
was removed. Then he pronounced the
building lit and ready.
The general crowd was not admitted
until after all the invited guests had been
ceated. Then the massive doors were
swung open for the waiting throng. Cap
tain Spillane and Lieutenant Conboy were
there with eighty-five of the city's finest
policemen to see that no offense against
the property was committed.
Over five thousand invitations had been
cent out. About half of them were ad
dressed to prominent men in other States.
President Roosevelt was an invited guest.
Governors. Senators, Congressmen from
every district, were all included. Com
mercial bodies from many cities were in
vited to be present and witness the open-
Ing of this magnificent example of San
Francisco's progress.
The opening ceremony was very simple.
In the open mailing room seats had been
provided for the five thousand invited
g-uests. The reception . was held under the ,
auspices of the Manufacturers' and Pro
ducers' Association, assisted by a commit
tee of prominent citizens and representa
tives of other local commercial bodies.
In tixe front of the room was a long table,
an American flag completely enfolding it.
On this was a Email bouauet of cardinal
roses, a gift to Postmaster Fisk, the only
decoration not a part of the architecture
of the building.
PROMINENT CAL.IFORXIANS SPEAK.
"The Stars and Stripes Forever" was
played by the band at the opening of the
exercises. Then Andrea Sbarboro, presi
dent of the day, made a short address
and introduced the Mayor of the city.
i.I'll.UIXi AI.K MADE READY.
Four national Rags topped the great
fihite building, and they tugged and
feulled at their halyards in the breezes of
the afternoon. Smiling up at them was
the crowd below, glad that the Govern
ment officers were finally established in
their. new home. Gladness was in the air.
Ean Francisco opened her new post
tffice building yesterday afternoon. In
this tnagniflcent creation of twentieth
tentury architecture, a Government tem
rle fashioned in rarest marble and
trimmed with costliest woods, touched
t very where with colorings of th-Â» highest
artistic delicacy, solid as the mighty nat
ural mountains of the earth, the splendor
cf whose beauty far surpasses even the
fondest dreams of King Solomon in plan
ting -his historic monument to the power
of the Lord, 3000 loyal citizens of Califpr
Â»aa gathered to express in a small way
their gratification at the completion of
the finest postofSce building in the world.
It was a glad day for San Franciscans.
For years they fought to get the needed
Appropriation from Congress, and when it
finally did come there were more years of
halting for the completion of the etruc
ture. Yesterday marked the culmination
cf all the work and worry, and the thou
eands were ready to celebrate the Joyful
Occasion.

At the end^of the exercises there was a
hearty call for Architect Joseph W. ; Rob
erts, who has superintended - the con
struction of the building: He assured
the audience that the Postoffice was .well
built and that It would stand the ravages
of time. Then Henry F. "Williams, who
built the first Postoffice in San Fran
cisco, told of the early days when
after steamer time a half day's
wait was necessary before the mail
was distributed. After this the ropes
all over the building, were let down and
the crowd wandered through the many
halls and rooms for hours, marveling at
the beauties of architecture before them.
SBARBORO OPE\S EXERCISES.
President Sbarboro spoke as follows:
. The board of directors of the Manufacturers'
Â«nd Producers' , Association of California and
tbÂ« other commercial . bodies of San Francisco,
all of which have the Inierect of the city and
Btate - at : heart, have tnvtted you to-day to
participate ,in the - cjrcnura:es of , the opening
for business of our new Postoffice and Court
bouse building 1 .
â¢ I am pleased to rnfortn you that San Fran
cisco has \u25a0 now the finest Postoffice and Court
house building in the United States, : and per
haps the finest In- the wide world. We are
rratefu! to our Government and to the gentle
men wbo ; have assisted . us . in â¢ obtaining this
magnificent building, several- of, whom I am
pleased to say are with uÂ« nere to-day.
What changes have occurred In half a cen
tury! To-day Juliet received the sweet missive
through the mall from her Romeo and thu
merchant . receives a checx ror his dividend al
most before the Ink Is dry on the paper. Yet
there is in sight still another Improvement for
the rapid delivery of the mail, and that I*
the pneumatic tube: which we hope to have In
this city very . shortly.
There is one. point, however, which has . been
overlooked In procuring land for our Postnf-
Bee and court j; bulWlng \u25a0 that should be at
tended to without any funner delay, and that
is the obtaining of the land nn Market street,
commencing at-th* easterly \u25a0 line of the Grant
building and running easterly about 200. feet.
This land should be Immediately condemned by
the. city for. park purposes, co that our. mag
; nlflcent Postoffice.. Instead of being -hidden be
hind other 'buildings, could be' seen, and ad
mired and virtually ' have a frontage .on the
principal street of San Francisco. ,â¢
- In- the cities of Europe, notably at ; Milan,
Italy, splendid- and .historical- houses have re
cently been torn down in order to give , ample
space for viewing the most elaborate cathedral
In the world. . .-;Y, \u25a0
In this city, where we have ample room, we
have first : made .the, mistake of. selling the
land surrounding ouHCltjr Hall. : Let; us ;not
now make another mistake of hiding from view
our grand PoÃtoffice building. ... .
I appeal to the press, to the Society, for the
Improvement and Adornment of San Francisco,
to the municipal officials of this city and to our
Representatives in Congress to aid In procuring
the land and building a park so as to have the
frontage of .our. Postofflce on Market street.
who expressed his appreciation of the ef
forts of those who had done so much to
influence Congress to grant the appro
priation out of which the building was
constructed. Senator Flint followed, and
in order Postmaster Fisk, Senator Per
kins, Judge W. .W. Morrow, Congress
man Julius Kahn, Congressman E. A.
Hayes of San Jose, ex-Congressman E.
F. Loud and John P. Irish followed with
short speeches. Colonel Irish fittingly ex
pressed the beauties of the structure
when he said that "it is a beautiful
poem in marble, taking its place at UÂ«e
top of all artistic endeavor." All ex
pressed sorrow that there was not a
plaza extending out on the north to Mar
ket street, and Chairman Sbarboro said
that he hoped that this land -would in
time bÂ« condemned and Jhe park com
pleted. Great praise was given to Con
gressman Loud, for his untiring efforts
in helping secure the .new building.
PERSONAL .

A Living
Monument.
Jf we were to assemble all
those who have been cured of.
heart disease by Dr. Miles'
Heart Cure, and who would
to-day be in their graves had
not Dr. Miles' been successful
in perfecting this wonderful
heart specific, they would pop-
ulate a large city.
What a remarkable recordâ
a breathing, thinking, moving
monument, composedof human
lives>-that for which every
other earthly possession is sac-,
rificed.
The Miles Medical Go. re-
ceive thousands of letters from
these people like the following:
*1 feel Indebted to ths Dr. Miles'
Heart Cure for my life. I desire to call
the attention of others suffering as I
did to this remarkable remedy for the
heart. For a Ions; time I had suffered
from shortness of breath after any
little exertion, palpitation of the heart;
and at times terrible pain In ths region
of the heart, so serious that I feared
that I 'would some time drop dead upon
the street. One day I read one cf your
circulars, and Immediately went ~to
my druggist and purchased two bot-
t>s of the Heart Cure, .and took it
F.coordins: to directions, N with the
result that lam entirely cured. Sines
then I never miss an opportunity to
recommend this remedy to my friends
r.-ho have heart trouble; In fact I am
a traveling . advertisment. for I am
â¢R-idely known In this locality."

"Tivr Kreling was a power at second
base, and Hank Harris should make a
hot foot after Matt Canavan/ for on
third cushion the latter was a stone
vail all by himself.
As. the game progressed and the time
for ordering flowers approached. Manager
Harry of the Orpheum's retreated to
deep center, where he* reposed on the
grass. Johnny ' Campbell -of the famous
talkabout team of Smith and Campbell,
occupied the box for the theatrical ag
gregation. Johnnj- was : skeleton fii^ged
and his rapid fire cluster of floaters" and
bender*, while well received, would , have
been more effective with better- support-
Following is the . make-up , of the . op

Knwlly Defeats Harry OrndorfTa Or
phenra Stara at Ooldea Gate Park.
Jimmy Britt has one more notch on
his gun. His team of baseballers de
feated the Orpheum team under the
management of Harry Orndorff at
Golden Gate Park grounds yesterday
afternoon. Bcore. 13 to 6. Aside- from
a run In to Strawberry Hill, accompa
nied by Frank Raf eel, paced by Man
ager Willis Britt on horseback, this
â¢was about the only work the crack
lightweight Indulged In.
The game attraoted a large crowd
and furnished a deal of amusement,
for neither team came within a mile
and a half of dishing out big league
ball. But for generalship tbe cookies
and loecreaxn must be slipped to Cap
tain Britt, for he rang In a battery â
Romar and Collins â that will do. The
former had a collection of shoots and
tortuous curves that should find place
in the park museum, the opposing team
thought, while Collins must be one of
"Mugsy" McGrawfs utility men. .James
Ed ward put a. crimp In his batting av
erage by banging the atmosphere on
three separate and consecutive occa
sions first time at tbe plate, but there
after displayed marked Improvement.
His tat-t sprints for high ones that just
passed over his bead In center field
scored an Immense hit with the many
fair fans present. Manager , Willis
Britt, -laboring under the disadvantage
of Increasing avoirdupois, covered right
field in his old-time form, and with' a
Chinese laundry \u0084 basket few errors
would have been recorded against his
name.

STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Aug. 29.â
The first practice of. the season for the
cardinal squad will be held upon Sep
tember 11. This will jjlve the players
at Berkeley several weeks' start over
'the Stanford eleven. The reason for
the delay Is that the warm weather
would do' more injury than good.
. A large rally for the purpose of
arousing 1 enthupiasm will be held Fri
day evening, September. 8, at which
the coaches and those connected \u25a0with
the gridiron will address the assembled
students. This rally, which will be the
first of the year, will be held in Enclna
Hall, as has been the custom In former
years. All those who Intend to try out
for either the. 'varsity or the freshmen
eleven will mlgn the training rules at
that time. '
Because of the loss of Sprott, who
will not return to college. It will be
necessary to elect another man to fill
his place as captain. In order to ac
complish this all members of the old
squad must vote. As the team of. last
year Is scattered about. the country and
will have to be reaohed by wire It Is
not probable that the announcement
will be made mu,ch before this - rally.
The captain thus elected will address
the candidates.
Three men of the old sauad have re
turned and the captaincy vrlll therefore

Every forenoon these days a number
of husky-looklnc men with determined
looks on their faces may be seen swat
ting a ball about Recreation Park,
stopping hot grounders, twisting:
curves over the rubber slab and prac
ticing doffing tneir caps to an imag
inary cheering crowd In the grand
stand. These men are the firemen and
the policemen who are to represent
their departments in the great ball
game that takes place Sunday morn
ing next at this park. On the result
of .this game depends whether the men
of the stars or those of the white and
gold badges shall have. the inside of.
the pavement and receive the smile*
of the pretty girls. The honor of each
department- hangs upon the' score,
which Is the reason that the sod out
at the park is being dampened with
so much perspiration every morning.
Rivalry is getting so strong that a
detail : of SherinT"e^--Â«leputie* has been
assigned to the gro 'd 'to preserva
peace, even at pract!: i the men of thÂ«
rival departments reaching far Imag

As It is almost certain an umpire or
two will be mobbed before the game
is half over, a large crowd i 3 expected.

LARKSPUR. Auk. 29.â Battling Nel
son, his manager, Billy Nolan, and his
sparrir.fr partners left unexpectedly for
Colroa this afternoon. TCeleon left here
on his pony at 2:15 p.~m.. He expects
the eeventrpn-mile ride will compen
sate him for his afternoon daily stunts.
Joe Millet's Six-mile House- aj Colma
has been eng-agred by Manager Nolan as
his new training quarters. He assign*
Ms departure to the prevailing warm
weaih<Â»i, which has reduced him to his
flghtinE: weight suddenly. lie also feels
that, owing to the great climatic dlffer
ence between Larkspur and Colma. it
Is to li!s interest to train there and
become acclimated.
The training quarters are three
ouarters of a mile from the new arena.
"When It Is completed Nelson will box
lliore each dar with four or five fast
rntn. In the meantime he will box in
the srymnnslum. He Is also a handball
enthusiast and will add handball to his
daily Ptuut. Bat took a short Jog oVer
the road this morning, and after hla
shower bath weighed 133 pounds. Bat
and his caravan feasted on choice ven
!s>on steaks at their farewell luncheon
through the generosity of Dr. ] J. J.
Crow-ley, the village pharmacist.
Battling remarked. "I am feeling'
real game to-dar."
Nolan said It was absolutely -neces
sary to move, as the heat to-day was
Â£0 in the shade and It was enervating
to Bat. This evening Larkspur looked
like a deserted village, especially
around Metzner'e. Joe Angell is the
only one left of the fistic aggregation,
and he will leave Thursday for his ten
round bout with Landers. Metrner
eaid this evening: "This morning, in
response to Nelpon's request. I went
and saw him weighed. He tipped the
beam exactly at 133 pounds. He said
the weather was responsible for It. â¢ I
told him I was of the same opinion
an 4 It was for his best 'nterests,to.go.
I am firm 5n my convictions that Bat

The go between Harry Ruey of the
Ariel Rowing Club and Jim Horan of the
Hawthorne Club was etoppÂ«d in the third
round because the spectators were tired
of the love feast. Both fighters acted like
fend relations, and it was only, during
an occasional spat that either was. hit.
Joe Leahy had a hard tussle with Tom
Ryan in the fourth event and barely
earned the decision. Both wore Haw
thorne Club colors. Leahy won on his
in-fighting.
It was no trouble for Willie Wolf of
the Ariel Rowing, Club to give John Mc-
Donald enough punishment to make that
individual wish to" retire to the comfort
of friends. During the two -rounds of
fighting McDonald received enough j pun
ishment for^. ten men. He apologized to
the crowd, stating he- had been ill. .
The best preliminary was a close- bout
between Jack Rodney of "the Ocean View
Club and. Pete Sullivan of the Haw
thornes. - Rodney won by fast blows by
the kidney route during â¢ the flnal round:
Willis Conroy of the Hawthorne Club
punished Kid Soto of the Star Club so
badly that Referee , Eddie Smith stopped
the bout and named "Conrby. the winner.
Soto wos wild, but the Hawthorne' boy
landed at will. ' v
Al. Emmick, unattached, gained the de
cision over Johnny Murphy after four
rounds of fast fighting. For 105 pounders
these two boys put up a strong exhibi
tion. Blood -flowed freely in every
round. ! . -
Three killing right jabs in the kidneys
followed by a left -swing to the. head did
the work and changed the result from a
seeming certain draw]'to-a decision for
Lundie. At that Barry was fighting
fast when the gong rang and was doing
his. best to" bring the sleeper over to his
opponent. The decision \ was: a' just 'one,
though close, and it brought cheers from
the large j crowd of Olympics about the
ring., ' -
The Hawthorne Club card was a good
one. . The preliminaries, were fast and
the main event a whirlwindâ uncertain
enough for any one's money. Barry had
the best of the first round, landing re
peated stingers to the head and . face.
In -the second and third rounds neither
had the advantage. Barry's jabs to the
face were counterbalanced, by the body
blows of Lundie. At the^tapof the gong
In the fourth round both tried to force
the fighting, each realizing that the end
would be close and each trusting , : to send
home the dreamy one..' Then, came the
final minute,'- Lundie's right wallops
banging thrice for the.' kidney*, the left
to the head, and the; decision. '.\u25a0-\u25a0\u25a0.\u25a0;'
.It was not until the last minute of the
final round that Bob Lundie, righting un
der the emblem of the Olympic Club, won
the decision from Tom Barry of the
Hawthorne Club last., night' at Wood
ward's Pavilion. "Vi-'V' ,"?.%} .-\u25a0' \_
(The question as to who will pay the fee
of the referee in the Britt-Nelson fight
was brought up unexpectedly, last night
when Manager Jim Coffroth received a
telegram from Jeffries asking what fee
would be paid the referee.
Manager* Coffroth wired back that the
usual fee was $500. the contestants doing
the paying. Vp to a late hour no reply
had been received from the big fellow.
When the question was raised as to who
would pay the referee there was a gen
eral sidestepping by the parties at in
terest. Manager Coffroth smiled his most
engaging smile and said blandly: "If I
appointed the referee I would expect to
pay him. As I did not select him I am
not responsible for his fee."
Willie Britt, the managing brother, and
Manager Nolan said as with one voice:
"There Is nothing in the articles regard
ing the payment of the referee. If we
w*re to pay the fÂ«e It would have been
so stated."
If Jeffries maintains the rate of JIWO he
charged for the Hart-Root fight at Reno
restoratives will have to be applied cer
tain person* to-day. 'When Jeffries* re
ply is received this latest tangled ske!n
in the arrangement of .the fight will
probably be unraveled without delay.
From present appearances the fighters
must foot the bill.
Nelson moved his camp from Larkspur
to Colma unexpectedly yesterday. The
Marin County resort ha? become a de
serted village in a twinkling. It would be
npcewary to administer laughing gas to
Mm* Host Metzner to restore that pe
rennial smile which went with each
\u25a0 j drink.
The extreme heat and the fact that
Nelson had touched the IS3-pound mark
when he should have four or five extra
pounds of flesh on which to train Is given
as the cause.

JEFFRIES ACCEPTS OFFER.
Nolan, it is said, intends to unload his
bank roll on Neleon, and wh3'- should he
want to place the coin at even money,
w^ien odds may be obtained? Britt has
earned a decision over the Battler, cake
walked in his bout with "Kid" Sullivan
and if form and. class can], be applied to
lighters he should be the favorite.
In the last encounter between Britt and
Nelson much stress was laid by critics
on the "holding" tactics indulged in by
Briit, when the two boxers were clinched.
Granting this, why "do referees permit
butting? Nearly every boxer that ever
met the Dane complained of being butted.
Young Corbett and Herrera being among
the number. In their last meeting at
Mechanic?' Pavilion Brttt received a se
vere cut over the left eye, due to a butt
from Nelson's hard skull,- but he made
no complaint to the referee. When he
met Bowker. the American champion,
Frank Neil was cautioned by the Eng
lish referee for boring in on his opponent
with his head, and competent Judges say
Nelson would not last two rounds across
the pond without being disqualified. This
matter should receive the attention of

"Slats" Davis and Otto Makowskl
handled the indicators and both escaped
without suffering bodily harm.
And now it appears that Billy Nolan,
manager for Battling Nelson, is worried
over the prospect of Jimmy Britt ruling
favorite in the betting.for the big con
test on September 9. Credit should .be
given Billy for springing a new one. So
convinced is Nelson's manager that there
shuuM be no choice in the auction pool
ing that he wagered $100 with a well
known turfman the other evening, that
the Dane would sell equal favorite with
the Californian.
BRITT SHOULD BE FAVORITE.

| age one. 'â¢\u25a0';\u25a0 There were two stakes, the

FRENCH BARK LAFAYETTE, LONG OVERDUE OX A VOYAGE FROM LONDON TO SAIGON", AND QUOTED FOR REINSUR
ANCE AT 90 PER CENT. WHICH WAS POSTED AT LLOYDS YESTERDAY AS UNINSURABLE, WHICH MEANS THAT ,
SHE IS THOUGHT TO HAVE BF.EN LOST. ' . ..
The French bark Lafayette was posted
at Lloyds in London yesterday as unin
surable. This means that those in the
best position to judge have come to the
conclusion that little hope remains of the
vessel ever reaching port. The Lafayette
was well known at this port. She left
New York IS! days ago for Saigon. She
hits not since been seen. She was quoted
lor reinsurance at 90 per cent and was
quite heavily played by local speculators.
Three overdue vessels were added yes
terday to the list of the reinsured. The
French bark Notre Dame d'Arvar. out
123 days from New Caledonia for
liotterdaxa. is quoted at 1 pOer cent. The
British bark Grasmere, which left a port
on tliÂ« west coast of South Africa 125
days ago for Dublin, is quoted at S per
cent. The British ship Nelson, out 177
days from Victoria, B. C, for Newcastle,
Kngland, is on the board at 10 per cent.
The other overdues are: Port Stanley,
15 per cent; Lalla Rookh, 65 per cent;
Deccan. 10 per cent. Small hope is enter
tainea for the safety of the Lalla Rookh.
â¢The fire, which started in the second
growth of timber near Ben Lomond,
has worked Its way from that town to
the headwaters of Love Creek, ' the
flames leaping at some 'points 200 feet
in the air.; Backfiring around Brook
dale under the direction of Judge Lo
gan, a large property owner of the dis
trict, has. been in progress for two
days. The town of Brookdale. with the
county flshhatchery, is now considered
safe, but it is feared Ben Lomond may
become prey to the flames before morn
ing. A ditch Is being dug between the
town and the brush, where the flre is
burning fiercely.
SANTA CRUZ. Aug. 29. â The forest
fires around Boulder Creek, which
were thought to be under control la3t
night, have broken out afresh and to
day several fine ranches on Love Creek.
near Ben Lomond. ' were swept by lire.
Deitz'3 studio was burned and although
a big force of men 19 working fight-
Ing the fire several homes in the vicin
ity are In Imminent danger of destruc
tion. Â«; Trunks are packed and people
are ready to leave at a moment's no
tice. ; V
Instantly there came a vigorous ob
jection from the attorney for the de
fense, who demanded that the prosecut
ing attorney's offer be put In writing
and submitted to Judge Hunter for a
ruling." Mrs. Heffley was temporarily
excused from the stand, but instead of
going directly to her seat she stood up
and passionately declared she would
not give evidence against her son.
."They were born of me and. are my
children 'and It is no use to try to get
me to 'swear my. boy's. life away." Then
came. .her fervent plea . to heaven for
the j accused, which the . attorneys did
not try to stop. : ;<
EXTREKa, Aug. 29. â Following a
hysterical declaration that she would
not swear away .the life of her only
remaining son, Mrs. Heffley, mother of
Jesse Dermody. the slayer of his half
brother', Frank ' Heffley. ' raised" her
hands in supplication to the Almighty
God and offered a fervent prayer that
the' life of the accused boy might be
saved. â¢- mis dramatic scene occurred
in the. Superior Court during the pro
gress of the Dermody murder trial. A
silence- which ' would have "permitted
the hearing of the dropping of a pin
reigned while the' aged Indian woman
made the supplication.
\u25a0 The unusual episode was precipitated
by the prosecution. Mrs. Heflley had
been called to the stand and after a
few .unimportant questions had been
asked her District Attorney Gregory
started to prove the respective inter
ests, of . Mr>. Heffley, her daughter, and
the deceased, in the home ranch . on
Cannibal Island, stating that. he would
produce testimony to show that the de
feadant had offered his hand in' mar
riage to a girl in the neighborhood,
saying' that he would soon -own apart
of the . ranch, .as Frank . Heffley .would
soon <be dead, for "If whisky did not
kill him some one would."
PORTLAND. Aug. 29.â 1t developed to
day that Harriman, - and ' not. Gould, â¢is
the!. employer. '.of the" survey,' parties in
the field I near j Eugene, working *oh Â§ a
road \u25a0 that [is to cross the Cascade Moun
tains and extend to Ontario, on the east
ern; border of Oregon, with branches to
Klamath Falls, Agency Plains and Lake
view. : - ...
This \is shown from articles .of incor
poration of the Oregon- Eastern Rail
way Company ; recently' tiled with the
Oregon Secretary of State. *Che lncor
porators named are J. P. O'Brien, gen
eral manager of the Harriman, lines "in
Oregon, and other employes. of. the sys
tem. A prominent railroad man said to
day: .' .â¢ â¢
There is no doubt that this move of Harri
man is part of his plan to shut the Gould in
tertsts and the Santa F<* out of Oregon If this
be possible. This accounts for the sudden res
olution to build the branch -line Into Coos Bay
to tap that rich country first and head off the
proposed lines up the coast. Action, no doubt,
in this matter was hastened by the actual
building operations begun on the Portland, Ne
halem and Tillamook * road. â¢
\u25a0 "Dunde*" Ktld, whu had the handling of
much Scotch capital in % years gone by. is the
promoter of this line to the coast. That he
could get further Bcotch capital Is not believed
possible, . and it Is strongly ' hinted that . he is
handling Gould | money. .
The road across the State would enter the
very rich territory that the Gould Interests
have 'proposed to exploit. : and a race to 7 be
first in the field with a line of rails may
itvelop. ',-... jr. ... . ,

of the appearance of the black-letter, type

PORTLAND, % Aug. 29.â Several prom
inent educators addressed the Lewis and
Clark Congress to-day,
among them being President Benjamin
Ide Wheeler of the University of Califor
nia. President said : : r <
The great problem with which tha world hU
tory will have to deal in the next centuries con
cerns the assimilation of . Eastern Asia to ' the
other world-half. Tha man of thÂ« West and thÂ«
man of the East cannot understand each other.
In supernclal things they may seem ' to estab
lish a . temporary understanding, but they arÂ«
apart on th-s : fundamentals. .
The \u25a0 Paolflc Coast - has become within fifty
years the outer selvage of Occidentalism. Its
population represents by its aggressive Individ
ualism its rlskfulness and its power of creative
initiative the most advanced type of the oc
cidental spirit. They are what the old Greeks
wore in the days when Greece was the inner
hem of the Occident. A century ago when the
world still . looked ! Inward and ' America was a
dlsatnt annex and the ; Pacific a desert of wa
ters the Eastern shore of our continent formed
its front and facade.' Now with the world
turned inside out, with the 1-aclftc established
as thÂ« world's forum,* with the .world's con
trasted halves arrayed on the opposing shores,
the front of the continent has shifted to the
West.
Within the next decades the educational in
stitutions of the Pacific Coast will 6urely be
called ( upon to an extent ' out ot all proportion
to anything in the past to render service in
opening-Western education to the people of the
Orient. As It always has been in the history
of~ human euueation, betterments and reforms
will proceed from the top downward. ' The
universities will lay the . foundations. It will
be the Chinese trained In the best our uni
versities can give who , will begin thei reorgan
ization .of their home education and I train the
teachers in the common schools. A recent Chi
nese graduate of the University of California
has already been put at the head of the edu
cational system of a Chinese province.
For the Filipino people who have fallen un
der our oversight in the order of events we
have done what no nation has done for a
colony of alien race. We have sought to give
them through education the power of eelf de
termination.
Our nation was shaped for the work of
evangelization. It has gathered into it all the
bloods and faiths of the, Occidental world and
has molded them together into a people out of
which is emerging the concept man. It has
based its Institutions upon democracy, the
most daring optimism devised by man, a sys
tem of governing whose chief ralson d'etre
lies 1n its power to educate and uplift men by
conferring responsibility, and saying to them.
"The law and the kingdom â Lo. they are
within you." The faith of our fathers is our
faith to-day. , Our evangelizing seal is the
zeal of democracy â the ultimate zeal of the
West, to make men self -determining- and self
governing. â¢ - â¢

Less ThanOne-Half as Many
Cases Under Treatment/ as
There Were Ten Days Ago
Forty - Five Persons Taken
With Yellow Jack During
the Day in New Orleans
NEW ORLEANS, Aug. 29â The report
on tlie. yellow fever; situation up to S
p. m. is as follows : New cases, 45; total
to date, 1832.- Deaths, 7; total, 267. New
foci, 9; total, 429. - Under treatment, 174.;,.
The most important development in the
yellow if ever situation to-day was the
report' of. Dr. C. " Mllo Brady, who had
been sent by the j State Board of Health
on : a tour of inspection of the bayous
and lakes in Jefferson parish, where there
are many ' settlements of fishermen . In
constant' communication with !â¢ New , Or
leans. Dr. . Brady, made the trip with Dr.
Shanley. of North Dakota. Without com
pleting their investigations, they discov
ered > thirty-five cases of yellow '\u25a0\u25a0; fever,
mostly along. Bayou Barataria, learned
that deaths had occurred and found much
suffering. After Dr. Brady , had made his
report, the State board decided to or
ganize: immediately \u25a0 a relief party con
sisting of a physician and two nurses. A'
large : supply of medicines . and provisions
also will be forwarded.
The local situation continues to give
grounds for hope. On August 18 there
were estimated to be 459 cases under
treatment, but since then there has been
a steady diminution, until to-day there
were reported only 181 sick, 74.6 per cent
of the total of 1788 cases having been dis
charged as cured or convalescent. 1 . '
Dr. . Gulterras will be sent to Natchez
as soon as he returns to this city. Satur
day and Sunday of this week have bfcen
set aside as additional fumigation days.
Showers continued here throughout the
day,, succeeding a heavy rain yesterday
and there was a great moderation'in,tem
perature. The weather forecast is for
continued showers; to-morrow.

BARRY AND BURNS NEXT.
Rival Middleweight* Meet To-Morrow
Night at Woodward's Pavilion.
Dave Barry will place his Irish cham
pionship title in danger when he faces
Tommy Burns at Woodward's Pavilion
to-niorrow night. The bout in which Bar
ry will risk his title will be a twenty
round affair and decided under the un
adulterated Queensberry rules. The
weight is 158 pounds at 3 p. m. on the day
of the contest. This contest should ba a
good one and just the kind to make a hit
with the spectators, Barry and Burns
are in excellent condition, having trained
the past three weeks for the contest, and
they should be in their best fighting form.
Barry was never known' to , keep away
In a contest, and Burns will have no
complaint to offer, for the Irish lad will
be after him from the tap of the "flr3t
bell. Unless Barry has changed his style
of milling! since be was last seen here
some two years ago he will be rushing at
Tommy like a steam engine and firing in
.right and left without even letting up for
the other fellow to collect his thoughts.
Keeping in view, therefore, Dave's usual
style of fighting, and there being no good
reason for supposing that he will .on thl3,
occasion depart from his -ding-dong style
since he has shown the same sort of
milling during his training, the contest
should prove an exciting affair.
Wind Falls Lip ton Cap Yachts.
SAN DIEGO, Aug. 29.â N0 race was the
result. of the first of the series of con
tests sailed to-day for the Upton trophy
by three yachts of the South Coaost
Yacht Club and two of San Diego Yacht
Club. The weather conditions were pe
culiar. The portion of the triangle form
ing the course that was directly off shore
had a fair breeze that promised a finish
race. The remaining portion out to the
buoy, forming the ocean apex of : the
course was in a dead calm alternating
with fitful puffs of wind. All the yachts
went once around, the six-mile triangle,
each losing much time at the outer end,
while drifting around the buoy. At 4:23,
when the time limit expired and the
judges signaled no race, the Detroit,
which was leading on the home stretch,
was a mile or more from the finish, and
the Butcher Boy some distance behind.
The two yachts . finally drifted to the
starting point, the Detroit leading* by

parts of th* State, but the grain crop aa
a. whole is Quite, disappointing . and consider
ably below average. Barley has -turned out
very well In most sections and wheat is a fair
crop In places, though a failure in others.

\ew York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. Aug. 29. â To those who ex
pected a tremendous manifestation of . bullish
enthusiasm to follow the peace news from
Portsmouth the course of to-day's stock market
must have been somewhat disappointing; . jTo
be sure, the early announcement . brought an
upward move, in, which the greater part of the
list participated,' but this movement was not'
well sustained, being followed by periods of
dullness and come hesitancy. Operations broad
ened . later, and the momentous event wae re
ceived with extreme, satisfaction by. the "bank
ing interests, relief being expressed at the
elimination of a very disturbing factor. The
attention of these same toanKtng interests will
now doubtless be engaged m figuring upon the
peace loans which it is generally assumed both
Russia and Japan will find it convenient to ne-*
rotiate. "Preliminaries to this end have been
in progress for several weeks here and abroad,
and. while definite details as to the extent of
the proposed loans are yet unobtainable, it is
utrongly intimated that American bankers- will
play an Important part in what promises to be
the greatest financial game of recent years.
The conspicuous feature at the opening here
was Canadian Pacific, which advanced to a new
high record credited to buying of foreign inter
ests. There was a renewal of recent pressure
on Reading, > and some of the other coalers
moved in sympathy, but later recovered.
Amalgamated Copper was strong, with another
advance in the price of metal. Of the other
ttandard issues Union Pacific, which was sold
ex-dividend of 2% per cent, wsb strong. Al
though the ' news from I'ortsruouth \u25a0 became
known toon after noon, reports discrediting it
were, current and it was not until an hour
later that the traders seemed to grasp its sig
nificance. Much of- the buying that then set. in
came from shorts. Features of strength were
the United States Steel shares, . Pennsylvania,
Reading, Southern Pacific and 'Chicago and
Northwestern. London restricted its trading
in this ' market brcause , or settlement - opera
tions, but bought on the peace announcement.
A new theory feature, was the strength of
Americans on the London curb, following the
closing of the regular market there. A reflection
of existing mercantile conditions was found in
the semi-Annual statement of the Associated
Merchants' Company, whicn operates a num
ber of dry goods stores "in "this and adjacent
cities. Its surplus for the period' shows an in
crease of J215,000. Acother heavy transfer of
cash to Chicago was repo'ried to-day, making
a total of $3,000,000 shipped to that center dur
ing the. month. The closing- was strong, the
highest prices of the day being shown. .
The bond market advanced In sympathy with
the rise in the Japanese Government bonds.
Total sales, par value, $7.U20,000. â¢
United States bonds were all unchanged on

ThÂ« following Interesting statement of the
current Prune eituaticn has Just been issued
by a large house in the Dried Fruit trade:
"There is little doubt in the minds of the
best posted packers that the Prune crop of thl*
State win be extremely light; in all proba
bility less than estimate* we nave forwarded
you.
"We have been gathering accurate statistics
of the total output of prunes latst year in the
various European countries where production '
Is largest, together with the bett possible esti- [
ma4.es of. the coming crop, and have compiled
came for your guidance. The results are rather
6ta.rt.llng and we herewith hand you same in
order that you may appreciate, ac we do, tne
email quantity, of prunes available to supply
requirements of the trade inls year.
"Our figures on the European crop of last
year, es well as -estimates on the coming crop,
furnished by our own Brokers abroad and

. "We feel sure our estimate of last year's
crop In this State, as well as the carryover, is
approximately correct, and that our figures for
I'Mjs are very conservative. ' The trade should
be advSeed of the condition of the prune mar
ket in order that they may be prepared for
1 higher prices than those now prevailing, in
case they do not care to avail themselves of
present offerings. The increase in minimum
weight gives' 'but 2500 carloads available for
shipment frOm this State, as against 7333 car
loads a year a.gr>, or. but a little over one-third.
The orders we have booked for future ship
mente in the smaller marxets are tor the same
number of cars as. they were last year, that Is.
buyers who -iikst. season- beusht. twÂ« cars have
done the itne this . e^&son. notwithstanding
tfce fact that they get 10,000 pounds more in
each car. . â¢ - - -
"Another point to be considered is that, a two
or three cent basis cuts but little figure In
the consumption of the article, as the" price
to the consumer is about the ' same, though
the profit to the retailer is ices.
"A large proportion of the crop in the Santa
Clara Valley has passed by contract from
growers to packers, and prices are advancing
dally." '

With trade ' rather quiet and. supplies of
everything except Cltni3 goods . plentiful. ' the
fruit-m arket presented a tame appearance and
prices of the leading deciduous descriptions had
a downward ' tendency. A~, noteworthy . feature
of the market - was- the arrival \u25a0of the- first
carload of Wine Grapes for the season. They
were'Zinfandels and came from Madison. Yolo
County. They . were . not ' sold, having arrived
too late. Receipts of table Grapes were liberal
and prices ' ranged ; lower, there being : no. de
mand for chipping. Pears, Peaches, Plums and
Prunes were quiet at about previous prices;
while Figs were lower under greatly Increased
receipts. Over 3500, boxes of Nutmeg Melons
arrived, - causing a weak market, and , Canta
loupsa j shared "in ' the weakness. Nutmegs were
still quoted up to 50c per 'box. but that figure
was : obtained only for a few favored brands
and most dealers were anxious , to "clean up In
the afternoon at the inside quotations. Berries
were in moderate, supply and steady for good
stock,. There .was" some active buying of Ap
ples . for ; shipment to â¢ Honolulu, but â¢ there was"
no scarcity- . of \u25a0 supplies :\u25a0 and prices were .no
higher. Stocks of Citrus goods were extremeiy
light and available supplies were finnlj^held at
stiff - prices.

warm weather continued during the week, with
higher temperature at the close, and condi
tions w*re vtry favorable for ripening fruits,
grains, beans and sugar beets. Table grapes
are ripe in some sections and picking has com
menced. The yield of guavas will be the beat
for five years. Walnuts are In good con
dition and making satisfactory progress; the
yield will be light in some sections. Orange
and lemon orchards are in excellent condition,
with a heavy setting of fruit, and it is esti
mated that the orange crop will be the heaviest
Â«ver known. Beans are doitig well and give
promise of a large crop. Sugar, beet harvest
continues. Early corn - Is ripening. Grain
thrashing and hay baling are not yet com
pleted. Â» \u25a0 '

living in Healdtburg. I She used to. come to the
city and make Mm - hire a room away from
me so he could be with her entirely. During
those times I would not see him, though I was
â¢n'orking hard to support -him; I kept room
insr houses ' at 1235 Market' street and 613 I>ar
kln street and. never asked that .he. help me.
All I wanted was <. that he '11 ye. ' vrith me,' for
I was then jand am now infatuated with Â» him.
Once \u25a0he went, to ; Los Angeles ; for several
months and was earning (90 a month there.
After^ . struggling for nine months
against, an lninulse to kill the husband
who/vshe alleges, has â¢ ill-treated and
finally deserted her. through the Influence
of her "mother-in-law, Mrs. Nellie Delven
thal .yesterday tried to end his life by
shooting him.-^ ' â¢Â£ ;''
She fired . two shots at him from a re
volver, one of the bullets grazing his side
and the other, going wide of its mark
as he was fleeing across the street. Mrs.
Delventhal declares that she shot to kill
and that she Intended to end her , own
life as soon as she was convinced that
her husband had preceded her into .the
next world. The shooting created a
deal of excitement ' in the usually peace
able and eminently respectable neighbor
hood in the vicnity of the small gas
and electrical fixture store at 710 Shra
der, street.' where It took place. '
The unhappy wife tells a pitiful story
of . her battle against : the Impulse that
prompted her to become a homicide. She
says that in ' her desperation -she even
consulted those who claim to have power
to bring- the human mind under control
by hypnotic and spiritual methods, and
that at times she was freed' from the
horror, but that finally the demon that
whispered to her to kill, became para
mount, and, taking the weapon she had
purchased nearly a year before. to accom
plish her purpose, she set out fully con
trolled by the desire to slay her hus

Mrs. Nellie Delventhal
Shoots With- Hom
â¢ icjdal Intent;
Mrs. Jane K. Sather. widow of the late
millionaire banker, Pedar Sather, and a
prominent member of Oakland's most ex
clusive eooiety. appeared before Court
Commissioner H. L. Joachlmeen and
made a deposition yesterday morning In
which fche denies emphatically that she
ever made a promise, either written' or
otherwise, to give her nephew.- W. R.
Howk, any cum of money, either while
she lived or in her will.
Mrs. Sather was indignant at the meth
od employed by her nephew to compel her
to" make a stipulation In her will leaving
Jilm $40,000, which he maintains was a
\erbal agreement between them when he
!eft New York and came here as her pro
tector. When asked j whether . she had not
promised to help Howk ai a financial way
Mrs. Sather said : "I only promised to
I help him help himself. That Is. I got ! a
position for him. which he accepted upon
his arrival from New York." .-'\u25a0
Mrs. Sather was very positive she: had
never said anything that could be taken
as a promise by her nephew whereby she
was to help him in any other way than
by getting him a position. .
It took less than fifteen =\u25a0â¢ minutes for
Mrs. Sather to state her'c&se. but In that
fifteen minuses she shut out forever any
hope that may â¢ be- cherished by her
nephew tcr obtain â¢ any part of her mil
lions by her .consent. Zi Although Mrs.
Sather does not say that she will not
mention Howk In her .will.' it is plain to
be seen he will have to fravel In. better
society and conform to 'her; "peevish
ways" if he wishes to win back. the platfe
in her heart which he has lost. '. "":
On account of his fine business ability
Howk was chosen to care for the widow
before the death of her husband, and ac
cording to ols claims he was to receive
. $40,000 at her death for his services. He
soon tired of the society In which he was
placed and relinquished his services in
behalf of his aunt. He spoke of her
"peevish ways" and refused to live wltjh
her. When he found he had incurred her
disfavor he had her summoned before the
Court Commissioner to show cause why
provision should not be made In her will
in his favor.
The subpena was issued July 29 and was
eerved on Mrs. Sather as she was enter
ing Ye Liberty Theater, Oakland, with- a
party of friends. Mrs. Sather, who evi
dently took this as an airing of family
affairs. Immediately called a hack and re
turned to her home.
If Howk de6ires to force his claim he
will be obliged to take further proceed
ings In the Superior Court. Mrs.
Sather's response to the summary writ
ends the first round of the legal- battle.
It remains to be seen whether the nephew
will take further steps. . ;
