Authorities Careful to

Benjamin Littleton Does Not
Long Survive Terrible
Punishment.
Epeclal Clep&tch to The CaJl.
SACRAMENTO. Sept. 29.â Benjamin
I-Ittleton, a convict at Folsom, died at
the prison Monday from t the effects . of
punishment In the straitjacket. ; The
facts In the case have just come to light,
although there was no inquest and Lit
tleton, according to the official records,
died from "natural causes." Littleton
had refused to work and Wai-den Yell
ordered that he be put In tne jacket.
Alter he had been laced In the case but
a short time the prisoner fainted from
tHe agonizing pain. He was immediately
unbound and taken to the prison hospi
tal. After lingering for a few days he
died last Monday. He nad been inter
nally injured. The attending physicians
pronounctd uretic poisoning of the kid
hlv^s the cause of death.
Two years ago, when a great outcry
was made against the use of the strait
>Â«LCk?*, order was imrifA fry Â«hÂ« P^jsp"
Directors, limiting the time the wardens
mU;ht keep a prisoner in the case and
providing that no convict was to be sub
jected to it unless the regular prison
physician first passed on his physical
condition and certified that he was able
to *;isr.d the ordeal. Warden Yell main
tains that he observed these conditions,
but the fact remains that some one erred,
li euch a word may be used. The fact
that Littleton fainted shortly after being
lÂ»iaced in the jacke*. testifies . to the fact
that he was not physically able to stand
the ordeaL
The ca.se has not yet come before the
Prison Erectors, but it is safe to say that
es souii as the facts are known an in
\tstigation will be ordered.
Littleton had been sent to Folsom from
Los Angeles for burglary. He had been
a. tJoub'csome convict.
WAIIDEX YELL'S VEUSIOX.
"Littleton was an incorrigible prison
er," said Warden Yell to-day. "I had
ordered his punishment in minor ways
fctverai times for infractions of the rules,
and finally 1 was obliged to tell him that
the next time he was sent to me it would
be the straitjacket for him. He was
cent to me again for misconduct and I
fell obliged to keep my word. So he was
ordered confined iv the straitjacket. It
Is the iiractice in all such cases to ex
amine the culprit carefully as to hia
physical ability to stana the punishment,
amd this was dune in Littleton's case by
I>r. Charles i\ Giadding, the prison phy
eician. Littleton revealed no weakness,
and in the presence of the physician and
the turnkey he was accordingly placed
In the jacket.
"Il is usual to confine an offender two
hours in the strait jacket, but Little
ton had undergone the punishment only
twelve or fourteen minutes when ho
fainted. He was immediately taken out
and brought to the prison hospital,
v here he was treated for several days
before his death. On Monday last . Dr.
Giadding and . the assisting physician
performed an autopsy, and reported that
Littleton had died from uretic poisoning
cf the kidneys. Littleton was buried on
the prison grounds after â¢ the manner of
other convicts who die . there."
XO IXQL'EST PERFORMED.
Warden Yell was asked if the punish
ment to which Littleton; was subjected
may not have caused death by "compres
sing the kidneys so they would not per
form their functions.
"I do not think that possible." said
tfce Warden, "for the inside of the
etraitjacket is padded at the waist to
prevent undue pressure on the part of
the body where the kidneys are located."
"Had Littleton had any kidney com
plaint while a convict, or received treat
ment' for any such disease?"
"No; he had not," replied Warden
Yell. "Littleton was a very compact,
hardy-appearing fellow of probably 30
years of age." i â
Asked if the County Coroner had been
notified so that an inquest might have
been held. Warden Yell said this was not
done for the reason it was not considered
necessary, as the physicians performed
an autopsy, and had returned a report
that death had resulted from natural
causes. Warden Yell said Littleton's
body bore no signs of injury from the
Et: ait jacket "punishment.

FORM POOL TO BUY
LEGISLATURE.
Startling Disclosures' Madeu in
Insurance Investigation. .,
At the investigation of the insurance-companies'
in New York yesterday it was â¢ brought, out by Prose
cutor Hughes that the big companies had formed a
pool to raise funds to buy legislation favorable* to
themselves in the Legislatures of the country.'- 0t
was testified* that special counsel had been retained
to see that the companies were protected. ~ : ,>.- .. : .
NEW YORK. Sept. 29. â When the
legislative committee on insurance in
vestigation adjourned to-day, until
next V\\-dnesdiiy it concluded a week in
Which greater progress had been
made than in any week since the in
vcstignUc:i v.ms begun. The testimony
of witnesses that have been ' called
during tiie week has been replete with
sensiuions aud to-day was no excep
tion to the ru'.<\
It -was <XuriuÂ£r the afternoon session
to-iay, \>hen Alfred W. Maine, an as
sociate auditor of tbc ISqultable \u25a0 Life
Assurance Society, ivas called to' the
\u25a0tosd- that It was disclosed that the
Llquitable I-IIV, the Mutual Life and
<Uc \ew York lAte eompanits bad
tx>nued a pool to look after legisla
tion in the various State Legislatures.*
Andrew Hamilton, to whom Presi
dviit rucCall of the New York Life
paid several checks, the purpose of
whi^h the counsel of the committee,
IJugrhes, has not yet brought to light,
was one of the chief members of the
legal, staff lor these companies, and
.received money for services from 'the
Em likable.
. .Maine told of the division of the
country to be looked after by Hamil
"tÂ»n. :n conjunction with E. 1 L. Short
and E. M. Thummell.
' !l'ke vtltaeHs preKcnted voucher* for
Iti:i::cy and paid by his company to Mr.
Hamilton. These shovrcd that In eisbt
Jears.. fruiu XS3S to 1903, the sum of
ys^JjUO nits paid to Hamilton for legal
â¢erviee*. -
Maine <lid not grive any details ot
tfae duties performed by Hamilton nor
of tÂ«* committee- he appeared before,
be>ond the fact that Hamilton looked
iiiiir legislative matters for all the
companies in the States west of Ohio.
Witness told of an agreement'where
by special counsel was employed by
one cwnpany in its territory and the
expense was shared by, all. He was
acked if campaign contributions came
under his observation, and he replied
"that they did rrot. He never heard of
money being paid to Influence, legis
lators. He was excused, but will be
called again to submit transcripts of
accounts giving information which he
was unable to supply.
PROFIT OX BUILDINGS.
In , the afternoon session Edward I.
Devlin, the real estate manager of the New
York Life for the United States and
Canada, was called to testify as to the
cost of the buildings' in Paris. He had
only the transcripts of the reports this
department made to the home. office, but
it was bTcught out that the Paris build
ing was carried on the bojbks of thy com-y
pany at "a valuation of $1,102,604, f which'
accounts, v^nth the original costs and
improvements on the building, for.which
actual money to the amount of 52,533,104
"was paid for, over $1,000,000 being charged
uft the valuation en the books of the com
pany. Dtvlin said the net income on the
building to the New York Life was one
and cne-half per "cent en "the actual
amount, invested in the building, or-bo
tv.een three and three, and one-half per
cent ou the amount at which the build
ing was carried on the books of the com
pany. Devlin was on the stand when ad
journment was taken, but he will be
called again to submit transcripts of the
records to supply further information.
Net the least important development
of the tiay was the appearance on the
etand of Jacob H. Schiff, head of the
banking firm of Kuhn, Loeb & Co. Schiff
was the first witness of the uay and he
remained on the stand until 2 o'clock.
Bchiff had been waiting In the commit
tee's session chamber ror a day and a
half, being under subpena, and when
the usual time for recess arrived, Schiff
dtsired to proceed, as he had an engage
ment fer the afternoon. Hughes exr
plained the situation- to the committee
and it was agreed to continue until
Schist had concluded his testimony. Most
ot the time Schiff reclined leisurely in
the chair on the witness stand, but as
one point after another was brought out
he srsw excited and vigorously defended
his attitude while a director of the Equi
table, and claimed his firm had acted in
a conscientious manner in all its deal
icgs_with the society. V â¢\u25a0.Â«./,;. -j
AT MERCY OF HYDE.
At the conclusion of his testimony and
bttorc the committee could adjourn,
Schiit asked to be allowed to make a
statement. He was permitted and he
stepped forward on the platform and
rAade an impassioned "attack on tne State
Superintendent of Insurance r-andr -and state
rcentt â¢he liad made concerning ; Kuhn,
Loeb & Co., during the investigation of
the Equitable. Schiff emphasized his re
marks with rappings on the table and
frequently he Taised his. voice 'until ' It
was almost a shout. " During his testi
mony, too, Schiff made the charge that
the minutes of the finance committee
regarding a certain meeting were false.
He later qualified this, however, by say
ing if the transaction under considera
tion, one In Union Pacific preferred ."was
actually made, -be did not hear It, al
though he was present at the meeting.
'Again, during his testimony regarding
the power of the finance committee of
the EquiteWe Society, Sch'.ff waxed warm
in his explanation and said that the', en
tire committee was at the mercy of one
znan.
'"It *vas" all Hyde,** said Schiff, Â«all ;
Hyde and Alexander. Hyde wrote the i
inesfcaccfc regarding the offers made by '\u25a0
Â»uj- firm for participation In the syn
dicate | Hyde signed all the receipts;
UjiJp wrote nil the letters."
'â¢ In the matter of the 'James H. Hyde
and associates'* syndicate Schiff hotly
accused Mr. Hyde of trying to shield
himself. He said the position of a di
rector In the, Eauitable was that of a
hfcgllble quantity and that the direc
tors were mere figurehead*. "He said
further that he -had never asked any
fkvors of the Equitable Society. \u25a0
"1 have granted many favors,", he
said, "I have not done, as a director
of the Equitable, any wrong of com
mission. I may have done of onils
eloa. It. is a case of hindsight and not
one .of foresight. , But., xny. conscience
frces'tne of my liond. -.1 nave , been as
good a' director as* I 'knew how to".beÂ»
and I did my duty." ."'..;â¢' .:\u25a0'. . . .
â¢ The'commlttee adjourned "until next
Wedntsday morninj?. ":\::\. \u25a0 ;\

; The 'question of the ;proprlcty/of Hhe

years before he became a "tafembcr of

otiiorr* and -he had* no jviry ol know-
Ins more ' than these executive officers
cLuie tv (ell him.'."
Up to" a recent time ..Schiff wast qpali
fied as a director by \u25a0. shares transferred
by Hyde. Hyde drew, the' dividends on
these sharer Schiff received no beneficial
results f roi.Â» them. "They were . retranÃ
fcrred. to the trustees 1 under. the Ryan
purchase.- Schiff said that prior". (6; last
February he" was not .a"'policy. holder In
the Equitable, and, was not In *any differ
ent posltion> from many other directors
and hold his position af'the request of
Hyde t ' He was asked . to become a. mem
ber of the finance commitue. so that he
could g-ive histiudgment on the securities
the society "purchased. Tne - question of
propriety did not occur to "him- on ' this
point because the finance" commftee v does"
not. decide the actual purchase, -but J mere
ly advises the salvor purchase of'securi
ties. '. The value of his advice in Jtiis re
gard," witness said," was ; the same. r as 'a
Judge of a higher court because of 'his
experience.- His position was;nbt 6n*e f "of
much importance, he stated, because 'he
could not. insist that his .-judgment, be
followed. He could not say'Mt \vas "a
surprise to him to find r that his. position'
as a member of the finance commitee was
perfunctory." -
I B V-LAWS OUTWEIGHED.. . -
Schiff said that there was' practically,

and found them â¢correctâ; Schiff said they

Hughes said: "Now, in consideration of
the facts that have been developed at
this inquiry that the ' Equitable accounts

"With the object"'of'"gaining-sym

patrons of J. J. Doyle, owner of the Ar

.Here In San Francisco, '- where tha eight

workmen who must work irom 4 \u25a0 o'clock In
the morning until 7 at night and sometimes
it is S and B . o'clock oeiore they can get

The ... union requests . ?2 50 per day. . work to
end at- 7 p. m. for the day shift. â¢\u25a0 J. J.
Doyle of the Arcade ' Stables refuses 'to pay
the waces. When their- union is unable to
protect the men he treats them with the ut
most' disrespect. . -. ...i- . -
' Some time ago Mr. Doyto was paying his
men $2 per day and the men were in a posi
tion to secure an Increase to i" 60. Air. Doyle
raised the price 'to boarders $2 50 " per month
above his former prices. - One man cares for
twenty horses, Increasing Mr. Dqyle's ' Income
$50 per month per/one hostler; Increased pay
to hostler. $15 per month. Increased charge to
boarders $50 per month, thus Increasing- Mr.
Tcyle's net pronts more than $30 per month
per hostler. , 'To the committee .visiting Mr.
Doyle he acknowledged that he was still re
ceiving- the increased price from boarders, but
refused to pay the men more than $2 per day.

District Attorney Seymour asked the
witness if he tiad not on one, occasion
told him he was not tn' sympathy with
Seymour's part in â¢ , the proceedings
against the accused Senators." Mathews
h^ had and proceeded xo give his
reasons. He, jsaid he had given up his
room at - the Capitol to the accused
Senators fqr the reason that they were
Senators and/had a right to it and for
the further reason that he was a friend
of Emmons. '\u25a0''.'
MITHEWS GIVES REASON'S.
\u25a0 "There is spmewhere in my nature,"
proceeded Dr. Mathevrs, "Â«Â»â¢ sentiment
which was expressed by Marat just be
fore Charlotte Gorday stab Toed him to the
heart-J She had obtained access to him
en the plea of distress.' She got into his
presence and mentioned the trouble . and
he said: 'Madame, misfortune has claims
upon me which I never disregard.' That
i? r-ne of the reasons in addition to the
oibf^rs." Continuing Mathews said:
â¢I thought that when the District At
torney of this counts' came, here and de
rr.^nd<=d thit these men should not be
allowed to testify In their own behalf,
the District Attorney should have been
ehooed away from the place and told to
wait until the Senate had disposed of
these stiil living victims before he could
fasten his beak into their vitals. My own
belief Is that all these cases should be^
tried by the State after the Senate
disposed of them and not by counties.
Now, 1, was of the opinion, having those
views about the rights of these men, that
they were not justly dealt with. I did
not think it was the right thing for
Sacramento County to get a compound
magnifying Lick telescope to spy out
the specks on Kern County's escutcheon
iTJstpad of using our own naked eyes .to
see the blotches on our own.
f 'H these four Senators are guilty. If
they have done the things of which they
are accused, they are simply following
In the wake of the gigantic bribery that
has existed at the Capitol eince my
earj-est entrance into the building, and
there is hardly a shadow of doubt that
at least three United States Senators
have obtained their positions by the same
proceedings, and nobody has ever said a
word against them."
District Attorney Seymour asked
Mathews if he "spoke by the book."
Mathews replied thai he voted for only
one United States Senator and the record
would show his action was free from
a.ny imputation of wrongdoing.
COXTIXEXTAL UNDER FIRE.
In the trial to-day. Grove L. Johnson
began his investigation of the Continental
Building and Loan Association, losing
Fight of the defendant for the time being.
This was brought about by the declara
tion of Johnson that he could prove the
Continental to be insolvent at the time
Emmons and his associates In the Senate
started the investigation, whereupon
Judge Hart allowed an inquiry into the
effairs of the company.
. Clarence Grange has been ordered to
return and produce the by-laws of the
Continental. At the conclusion of to
day's session Johnson asked that Wil
!!i!ti Corbin be ordered to appear on
Monday with all the books of the Con
tinental Building and Loan Associa
tion, and the order was made.
W. J. Palethorpe, an expert account
ant, who experted the books for the
Continental Building and Loan Asso
ciation, took the stand.' Late yester
day afternoon District Attorney Sey
mour made an objection to the intro
duction of testimony by Palethorpe,
and the court took the matter under
advisernetit. This morning Judge Hart
announced that he would be permitted
to testify as to what was the financial
condition of the Continental At thÂ«Â»
time tlie Senate Committee on Com
missions and Retrenchment sought to
Investigate building and loan associa
tions.
Palethorpe testified he investigated
the Continental's affairs in November,
1904, and the examination extended
Into January. 1905.
ACCOIXTS OVERDRAWN.
Johnson asktd if the examination was
superficial or thorough. Seymour en
tered an objection to the question and
Johnson said he would prove that the
examination was only, superficial, Pale
thorpe having been blocked by Gavin
McNab and William' Corbin, the latter
being the secretary. After the objection
had been overruled, Palethorpe said he
asked In the course of his examination
to set the mortgage loans made by the
association. The witness said Corbin told
him he could not see the mortgage loans
and that he would not be extended any
further courtesies' of the office. It was
for this reason, Palethorpe said, that he
had not made a thorough investigation.
The witness said from his investigation
he found that certain people 'were per
mitted to overdraw their accounts. This
testimony was admitted against Sey
mour's objection. Those accounts were
overdrawn on November. I. 1904. the,
witness said. \u25a0'_,",'
Palcthorpe said the overdrafts, were
made cs> by the time he finished ' his In
%'estigatlon.

BIG STEEL DOCK
WORRIES NAVY
Department Trying to Find
Means to Get the Struc
ture to the Philippines
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 29.â Naval officers
in the Bureau of Navigation are study
ing the problem of towing the big steel
drydock just accepted at Sparrow's Point,
Maryland, from that port to Cavite, for
which it was desicnated. The bureau
wrote to-day to the headquarters of the
Suez Canal Company in \u25a0 Paris asking
about restrictions of traffic through the
canal and for figures in the way of tolls.
So huge is the structure that it may im
pede traffic in the canal and may cost
the Government an extravagant price in
tolls.
In some ways the Immense structure,
badly needed as It is in the Philippines. Is
a sort of white elephant to the depart
ment. To tow the structure will require
five ships equipped with towing ma
chines. These are not on the market,
but must be built to order. Unless the
canal company grants considerable re
duction from its published tolls and per
mits the dock sidetrack in the lakes
of " the canal while ships pass by, the
expense will be ruinous.
If the dock is to be towed around the
Cape of Good Hope the tow must be
started right away and the towing ma
chines have yet to be built. A start later
in the season means the encountering of
probabls* disastrous storms at the cape.
Neither Is the Suez route devoid of dan
ger, for the monsoon season on the Indian
Ocean and again' close to the Philippines
presents considerable hazard.
Large Carpro of Grain Leaves Chicago.
CHICAGO, Sept. 29. â The largest
cargo of grain ever shipped out of Chi
cago was cleared to-day on the steamer
George H. Russell. It consisted of
235,000 bushels of corn and 68,000
bushels of barley, aggregating 5572
tons. The cargo goes to Buffalo. V-^L

he had given Joseph S. Jordan coin. The

Frank Otis, an attorney of San Fran
cisco, who was under examination several
days ago, then took the stand to iden
tify the by-lays of the Phoenix Building
and Loan Association. Trapp was recalled
and also identified the by-laws, of the
Phoenix.
HOW COKBIX STOOD.
There was some question as to whether
the by-laws In evidence were in' force
last January, and at the suggestion of the
court Johnson caused a subpena to be is
sued for Clarence Grange, secretary and
manager of the Phoenix, *to settle the
disputed point.
At this point Expert Palethorpe was !
recalled. He stated in answer to a
series of questions by Johnson' that at
the time he made the investigation of
the Continental he was a stockholder I
in the concern and so notified Corbin j
and McNab. Reverting to the overdraft
which showed on the Continental books'
in November and December, 1904, John
son sought to determine what they j
were. Seymour objected and Judge Hart \
suggested that the quickest way out of j
the business would be for Johnson to !
issue a subpena for â¢ William Corbin, j
secretary of the Continental, to bring
that concern's books into court. John
son said he had already done so, but
did not know whether the subpena
had been served.. Judge Hart: said he
was getting "sick and tired" of the
way the case is dragging. j
Palethorpe was finally permitted to
testify to the overdrafts. In the de-.
posit ledger, the witness said, he found
overdrafts amounting to $5358. On an- j
other account he found overdrafts \
amounting to \u008417,125, of which $7199 I
stood against William *Corbin, the \
secretary.
The witness Bald he found further. yÂ£?it !
the debit account of William Corbin>ex- {
ceeded the credit account by" 59477 27.
Palethorpe said he told -McNab that Cor- j
bin was overdrawn, but McNab said !
there was nothing unusual In â¢ a man In |
CorWn's position being overdrawn. The I
witness eaid the property on Buena Vista "\u25a0{
avenue owned by the Continental had not â¢
been returning rental. This property was j
occupied by William Corbin. '
Palethorpe said when he called atten- j
tion- to this Corbin paid into the associa- i
tlon over * $1100 as . rent for the property |
of the association which he had been oc-1
cupying. Johnson tried to bring out in I
testimony t that the books of i
the Continental were not kept in a man- i
ncr to show all transactions. Johnson j
said it was knowledge : of this that had
In part led Emmons to believe with his" '
associates , that the Clntinental should be
Investigated. *

and her wishes were grauted. It was
through, this head that -she - aeoured
Antony for a husband. She told .him of
other things which she â¢ securtd â¢ through
the medium of the hea3. She. got the
head from a cemetery in Ren.}, Nev. .
One day Antony found a Chinese,' Lee
Gar, with his wife. A struggle with the
Chinese followed, In which Antony cut
his adversary's necK with a razor. He
dragged the body out in the sand, cut
off the head, buried the body, and Kept
the .head to see if it would not give- him
better luck. â¢â¢':â¢.

Two of our citizens." while on a. hunt on the'
east' elope of Mount Eddy, found Â«. piece of
gold bearing quartz. Not being- familiar with
prospecting, they failed, after long search, to
locate the ledgo from which their specimen
came. o : -..-,-\u25a0 \u25a0 ;
An old prospector appeared ' and agreed to
go with them and help to locate the 1 ledge.
But a short time elapsed when they had . lo
cated the vein, and that it is rich in gold -and"
copper there is no question. The ledge is about
three feet thick six feet from the surface,. and
free gold is discernible without the aid . of a
glass:. The parties Interested in this claim are
George and William Shebley, C. F. Galbraith
and.W. H. Pepper. George Shebley, an expe-.
rienced prospector, found the ledge.- -. -
Since this find Williams and Johnson "grub
staked" a prospector, who went over in the
adjacent . territory and located . another fine
ledge, carrying an abundance of native copper
and gold, j These finds are within five miles of
Sisson. â¢; ' . - - ' â¢ - \u25a0 :
It Is demonstrated that a strip of country
including Mount Eddy, ten by twenty miles in
extent, is well mineralized, and that all that
is necessary Is development.
County Tax Collector Bonner "'\u25a0 of Modoc
County, who has recently visited the new
mining district .on Pine ' Creek and on
Bldwell.. Mountain in Modoc County,
makes a report in substance as follows:
A rich district will be developed. On the.
Bldwell â¢ Bide several rich strikes have been
made, besides the.Kafader mine. Tbe,Kafadcr
mine is probably the richest claim yet located.
Leveson and Huntington have completed a
deal for claims on Pine Creek. This deal gives
them ownership of four claims, and the price
paid ($91,700) is probably the largest price ever
paid for a mere prospect. ".' -' HI
Plummer sold out a week or bo ago for ?25,
700. -The price ; paid to . Reed and Wade was
$66,000. The terms of the sale are, $600 down.
$3000 in sixty flay?; \u25a0 $7000 In six months and
$55.000, 1n one year. .'\u25a0'\u25a0\u25a0
Little 1 development work will be done this
year, owing to the lack of roads and therough.
inaccessible position of the mine. Snow falls
to a considerable depth, rendering It necessary
that comfortable quarters - be first supplied.
There is no question regarding the richness of
the mines. . Owners will start in early next
year to | develop them.

According to the statements of the

tivity in. the new. Golden-Masonic mining
district in Mono County. A forty-foot

RICH ORE AT GOLDFIELD. .
The Goldfleld Sun publishes a special
edition of forty pages. Among the state
ments made- about Goldfleld are the fol
lowing:
\u25a0Francis A. Thomson, superintendent of the
New Western Reduction Company, haÂ« com
piled figures showing the output. to date of the.
local district and estimating the probable out
put of the. present year.' ' *
Superintendent Thomson has made his state
ment brief and to the ! point. The figures are
absolutely accurate and tell the whole, good
6tory. The estimate of the output for the year
1006 is based on facts, and may be relied on as
being as nearly correct. as it is possible to cal
culate at this time.
\ Goldfleld became an actual producer three
months after its discovery (May, 1903), and in
eighteen months from that time has produced
in gold $5,200,000. This amount represented
17,000 tons, averaging more than $300 per ton.
The present production shows 100 tons of or 9
being milled per 24 hours of an average, value
of $40 per ton. .
The present production of shipping ore aver
ages 70 tons per day of a value of $200 per
ton. This will aggregate for the ensuing year
a production of | $6,570,000.
The foregoing â¢ does not take into considera
tion: the ore on dumps awaiting reduction at
local mills, amounting' to 20.000 tons of aa
average value of $30.
With the Increased facilities for transporta
tion and power supply, which have now ar
rived, and with the greater capital so sorely
needed to take the mines ' out of their first
prospective stage, the year of 1906 should see
the total gold output of the Goldfleld district
reach $10,000,000. .
Operations in Siskiyou County are de
scribed by the Scott Valley Advance. . The
account is given In substance :
The larger mines' have been closed down,
but will: be booming -by January, 1006. The
Portland ; Company, ttiat bonded the placer
grounds at \u25a0 Cecilvllle/' will put in a ditch to
handle the ground with pipe and giant. The
drqdger at Callahans .is running steadily. A
long tunnel is to be \u25a0 driven by the owners
of the I Headwaters ' mine lon Humbug Creek
to tap the ledge lower and to provide drain
age' facilities. ' Work . has been' resumed at
the Johnson mine at Oro Flno. The Salmon
River. Mining , Company will put in a large
ditch and flume to bring water on E the old
Petersburg ground./' A' new customs cyanide
plant is to be constructed on Humbug Creek.
The prospects for a good mining year never
looked more promising. \u25a0 A number of new
prospects were discovered the past summer.
New ; capital has . come into the county.

A correspondent of the Los Angeles
Mining Review writes:
There is no doubt that this great mineral
belt starting at Tonopah and Lone Mountain
and continuing southerly to Goldfield and Lida.
and thence southerly to Bullfrog and Chlorlda
; Cliff, will oroduce more gold than any other
mining section the world has ever known.
One thing' sure is that the line divldtne thÂ»
States of Nevada and California did not di
vide the ore. bodies, and Nevada will have
to divide the honors with California for itÂ»
production of gold to be found in this won
derfully rich mineral belt. More than that,
with a railroad into Bullfrog supplies will bÂ«
cheaper and the hardy prospector can and
, will Invade Death Valley itself. If this min
eral belt continues . still farther south the
chances- are: that Death Valley will show vp N
well In this '\u25a0 line, as the formation of the
Grapevine, of which the Bare Mountains are
an offshoot and In which the great Bullfrog
camp is situated, is similar to that in thÂ«
Funeral and Panamint ranges. _ 'â¢
The South Yuba Mining and Smelting
Company has sold a coppe? property near
French Corral, in | Nevada County, to a
party of San Francisco men and others,
who will erect a smelter. . The property
embraces twenty . or more claims, show
ing - copper. . Negotiations hayÂ© been in
progress some months for the property.
The party, of dredger prospectors ia
Mountain Meadows, Pluznas County, has
suspended operations. The inconvenience
attending the moving of machinery into
the Meadows i caused the operators to
abandon the Idea' of, prospecting ' with
drills, and the work proceeded, by the
open-shaft process to jsome extent. This
has proved to be a failure, because water
was too abundant.' Operations may be re
sumed when better transportation facili
ties are provided..
The Chicago quartz mine, in the Na
vada City district, is reported by the lo
cal papers to be in. full operation. . The
Chicago has a long history.. It' was partly
> opened and abandoned in the early days
of mining in California. Forty years ago
it was worked in a crude way. Litigation
was the next circumstance attending the
old property. Then' a Chicago company
took hold, and' from this fact the mine*
received its present name" Then followed
financial difficulties and the property was
sold by the Sheriff and was>bid.in by
Nevada City parties, who ; finally, obtained
a United States patent.'. ....
The Goldfleld Sun tells of \a reported
discovery of rich ore at Bullfrog.' In part
tho account follows: *' . v
Fifteen*.; pounds, of ore have been .received
by Wi H. Clark. It is Impregnated with g'olfl

Mysterious Crimes Traced to
Them and Valuable
Loot Kecovered.
NEW YORK. Sept. 29.â Central office
fleiectlves late yesterday afternoon found
iarge Quantities of silver plate and Jew
elry in dingy rooms In a Roosevelt street
tenement occupied o by Antonio Desisto
and his wife, Angela, an aged couple,
trho make their living by picking rags.
Bank books also found by the detectives
Shaw tctai deposits of nearly 46000 In lo
ceJ savings banks. The loot is believe*
by the police to be worth about $3000 and
to cover a period of fifteen years.
The discovery of these valuables, the
detectives say, throws light on many
mysterious robberies in the district
around Maiden lane.
The Desistos, protesting that they found
all their treasures, were locked up at po
lice headquarters charged with grand lar
ceny. Their arrest followed a complaint
made by J. W. Kokesalr of the Derby
Silver Company, Maiden lane. The store
was robbed between closing time on Sep
tember 20 and opening time on September
21 of valuable silverware. Detectives
searched tbe place and found on the floor
a &crap from an Italian newspaper and a
package of pins. With tiicss as clr;tvs
they decided to watch the Italian rag
pickers who swarm about the district at
daybreak. Some of these are admitted to
stores by porters to aaelst in cleaning up,
taking the refuse as wages. Antonio and
Angela Desisto were the most energetic
<Â»X these ragpickers. They had been
known" and trusted in the district for
Tears. The detectives watched the old
couple for several days and finally fol
lowed them to the Roosevelt street abode.
Representing themselves as officers from
the Board of Health on an inspection
tour, they made a search of the home
ar.d found the plunder, much of which
Las been identified by several Jewelry
merchants of the downtown district as
their property.

After jerkins? from the nead of Miss

b'old-hued hair George Britton slapped
her face with it. then delivered a loft
Jab upon the nose of her masculine es
cort, who precipitately fled, leaving
the lady to battle alone for recovery of
her coiffure. Kre she could wrest it
from the hands of the despoller, how
ever. 1-atrolmaii Ward swooped 5 upon
him, and In the confusion attendant up
on the arrest both Miss Stevens and the
wig disappeared. Â£
In the court of Police Judge Mogan,
where Mr. Britton. youthful and sullen,
stood accused o? vagrancy. It was nar
rated that jealousy prompted the~ at
tack upon Miss Stevens and her com
panion. She was premiere danseuse in
a Pacific-street â¢ "hurdy-gurdy." and
by the habitues of the establishment
Mr. Britton was recognized as her
"steady" and treated with the deference
due such an exalted position. Among
his exclusive prerogatives was that of
accompanying lier to and from the
shrine of Terpsichore, and by tacit un-
derstanding with the floor manage
ment he was privileged to secure her
hand for any dance he might select and
to be exempt from paying for the same,
regardless of whatever counter demand
for her services that came from claim
ants with money to spend.
Thus existed the situation until last
Thursday evening, when Miss Stevens
entered her scene of labors unaccom
panied, and from mouth to mouth In
stantly flaw the conjecture that she
and Mr. Britton had "scrapped." Nor
was that surmise weakened when he
arrived and, instead of pursuing his
wonted course of monopolizing her for
the choicest dance of the unpro
gramtr;ed series, a "bunny-hug two
step." stood aloof and gloweringly
watohod her trip the merry measure
In the embrace of an elephantine steve

abandon or bestowed more bewltchery
on a partner, tut the onlookers knew
that her animation was under forced
draft, and they glanced at Mr. Britton's
face and ominously wagged thf>lr heads
and Interchanged direful predictions.
It was about 1:30 o'clock a. m! and
at ICearny and Pacific streets that the
attack was perpetrated. The policeman
Is In doubt as to whether Miss Steven*
recovered her headgear or left it lying
on the field of combat when she fled to
escape arrest with her assailant. Nor

whose pose was punched by the defend
ant, and who so ungallantly ran away
and left Miss Stevens at thf. mercy
of said defendant, was the stevedore
hereinbefore alluded to. Both of Iheso
vital points, however, may be clarified
when the ca?<- is given a continued
hearinsr next Wednesday.
William O'Doherty of 30 Welsh street

Thursday evening at his home and a

until the two sruests became intoxicated
and pugnacious' and beat their host and
drove their hostess and her children -to
the street. They were arrested and

hearing until Mrs. O'Doherty is ready
to testify, probably to-day.
Humane Officer Hooper told Judge
Mogan that as an Instrument of" the
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Animals he had both seen and heard
of many heartrending cases of equine
dilapidation, but never did there come
to his ken. either through ocular or
aural means, a more distressing ex
: ample of ramshackle horseflesh than
that which he saw. Urbana Desperati
leading along Howard street near to
Twentieth. N -
When the animal first entered Officer
Hooper's scope of vision he imagined
it was an overgrown hornless goat,
so slender was Its underpinning, so
emaciated its neck, so bumpy Its cran
ial and facial formation. On nearer
approach, however, his surprise at see-
Ing a goat of such gigantic dimensions
gave way to mingled horror and In
dignation by discovering that It was aya v
horse â or what once" had been a horse.
The beast, was thin almost to the
point of transparency. Its knobby head
drooped- between its knobby knees be
cause of the Inability of Its scrawny
neck to remain erect. And it hobbled
as It wobbled, for one of Its fore-props
was lame nnd prevented from bending
by a fence slat doing service as a
splint. So pitiful was the sight that
Officer Hooper did not look at the
poor brute any oftener than he could
avoid as he placed ; its custodian* un
der arrest and escorted both the man
and the evidence to prison/ \u25a0
> Slgnor Desperati acknowledged to Judge
Megan that the, horse was rather debili
tated, but pleaded that he was taking. lt
to a veterinarian for treatment when the
officer thwarted his humane intention.
No, it was not. insufficiency of., food that
caused the animal's feebleness, but * a

mysterious constitutional ailment, which
he (SignorÂ»D.) was going to have scien
tifically diagnosed when the law inter
vened. As for. the leg- lameness; that did
not amount to mucli . and would rapidly
disappear under the fence-slat treatment,
which he himself had applied.
"I'll have to fine you $10 for cruel ty s to
anlmalÃ," said the , Judge, "and Mr.
Hooper is at liberty to do with the horse
whatever he considers "best;, for the ani
mal, even though it be execution."
With a sigh of mingled weariness
and defiance August Medeross, a dim
inutive- native of Portugal, said &>he
preferred imprisonment to dwelling
with his buxom, and square-chinned
wife, Catherine, by Â«j whom he was
charged with" having neglected to
properly provide, for his family, con
sisting of herself and five children,
after he had promised Judg.e ,. Fritz
that he would be a ; ->del paterfamilias
and had sworn in presence of a clergy
man to abstain from absorption of in
toxicating fluids for a period of one
calendar year.
"He broke both pledges within a
week," the lady testified. Â»'Â»
"Your tyranny drove me to do it,"
the defendant retorted. X
Then he went o f n to explain to the
court that no sooner was. he under
oath than his wife proceeded to take
unfair advantage of the situation. She
stayed out late o' nights, leaving him
toÂ«take care of the progeny, and when
he protested she sneered him to scorn
and informed him that ho must su
pinely endure. "Don't you dare to
complain," she was alleged to have
threatened "or I'll have you up before
the Judge again." Finally" he arrived
at the conclusion that the jail would
be a more agreeable abiding place than
his home, which is at 415 Fourth
street, and he went forth and drank
to excess.
"I hardly know what to do with this
case," remarked the Judge to the pros
ecuting attorney.
"Oh, don't let it worry you," said
August, "for I'd just as lief be In
prison as living with this woman."
"But your unfortunate children must
be considered," said his Honor, "you
can't support them if you are in
prison.
Mrs. Medeross, who evidently had
been impressed by her | husband's un
expected attitude, hastened to declare
that she did not desire to have him im
prisoned, but simply reprimanded, and
res worn to do his duty as a husband
and a father. "And I'd like to have him
fixed in such a way," she added, "that
he cannot desert me and the children
if he don't go to Jail."
"Maybe he wouldn't want to desert
you and the children If you were â¢ to
make his home life less of a persecu
tion," quoth the bench. "I won't ask
him to take another abstinence; pledge
or make any promises to me, and thus
furnish you with a- means of. intimi
dation, but I'll continue the case a
week to give both of you opportunity
to amend your conduct."
Mr. Medeross was departing alone
when his wife hurriedly overtook him
and grasped one of his arms, and she
was animatedly talking to him as they
disappeared down the stairway. He is
a journeyman baker. . -
Caught while loitering in a corridor of
Henry England's lodging-house, 617 How
ard street, although he did not reside
there, John Storrs stated that he was
seeking his second cousin, one Mrs. Bil
lions. As no such person had ever been
tenant of Mr. England, that gentleman
disbelieved Mr. Storrs' story and so an
nounced, for which he was battered by
Mr. Storrs.
"To tell you the truth, her name may
not be Mrs. Billions now," said Mr. Storrs
to Judge Mogan, "but that's what it was
when I last saw her, about a year ago,
and" she then told me she was living at
617 Howard street. To tell you the truth,
she's my second cousin on mother's -side,
and had three husbands before she mar
ried Billions. To tell you the truth, she
had left Billions when she told me she
was living on Howard street."
"And you think she has chosen a suc
cessor to Billions?" inquired the Judge.
"To tell you the truth, I wouldn't be
surprised to learn that she has had two
or three husbands since Billions held that
position," was Mr. Storrs' reply, "for, to
tell the truth, she's the greatest woman
for getting married I ever heard of. To
tell the truth, it's pretty hard : to keep
track of her name." :
"After telling me so much truth," said
his Honor, "I hope you will not tell me
anything else when* I ask why you de
sired toÂ« see Mrs. Billionsâ or whatever
her present name may be." -
"To tell youâ well, I wanted to touch
her for a little money," was the answer.
"To tellâ you see, I'm a > warehouseman
out of a Job, and, to tellyouâ well, I just
wanted to borrow." "
He was pronounced guilty of battery
and will be sentenced to-day. . .

cause the scpnomore burlesque has been

regards as distinct encuumSement to rÂ«i- J
bel against tht* revolutionary stand of the j
executive committee. â¢
Hitherto clashes and organizations have j
arranged social, musical, dramatic or lit- ,
erary functions us they chose. Now the j
executive committee, with President I
Whcejer'e approval, vises all lists of pro- j
postd doings. j
UrsinS me student body to rebellion J
against this new system, the Occident,
editorially says:
What mast we think of an action which
takes away irom us our tree choice and tries
indirect!}" to determine how much we mutt
*tudy and how ir.uch we most- sleep? Our
American blood revolts at the hothouse plant

ivo::i ts a satisfactory manner? â¢If he does
not kt-f. up his work there are various ways
thai this met indicates itself to him more
or lees tamiliar to all. Then let the individual
learn whit proportion ot time be can give
tu> omCy and play and govern himself ac
cordingly. To be more specific, if a sopho
rcore wishes to take part in a burlesque or
atttrvd the same, let him consider tor himself
"whether or no he can spare the time and let
bira prosper or suffer according to the wisdom
or folly of his decision. Thus are -Americans
made.
The Occident" editor gives a cue to the
sophomores who are contesting the com
mittee's order regarding the sophomore
burlesque in these words: "It is generally
accepted that this committee has a gen
era.l advisory influence over almost all
etudent affairs. However, it is difficult to
tee by just what means it can enforce its
mandates."
Speaking ostensibly for the student
body and explaining the alleged desires
cf the students vrith respect to their
wishes in the matter of the powers to be
exercised by the executive committee, the
Occident says:
Doubtless there is a general feeling among
represectatives of ! ali classes that some one
central power supervise the student events,
with a view to distributing them in an even
and tolerable manner throughout the year and
thus prevent an excess of events at one time
and a dearth at another. But we do not
believe that the student body wishes any cen
tral power to chop off any of the events: be
cause the students have a very efficient maa
nrr of doing that for.. themselves, to wit: not
attending. There are a few things which a
student should decide for himself, X he In
tends to leave college an Independent, self
relying Amrrican citizen. Among these few.
things to be decided by himself are. first,
how much to eat, and, second, how much to
eleep. . These things vary so much with dif
ferent people that no general law will be sat
isfactory. Also, it is a fact that some stu
dents can stand more dancing and entertain
ment than other*, and It is distinctly up to
each to learn, either in college or in later
life, how much he can stand. We are told
that the young learn beet. ;. -

The boy tells of a policeman seen asleep
behind a tree near where he and his
brother were preparing to rob an unsus

two set frightened Cupid a-flutter among

by robbing an amorous swain who was
hugging a girl on a bench. The swain,
had but 30 cents In his pocket and was
promptly denounced as a "cheap guy."
Another young man, held up on the
street, talked so loud in his' fright about
haying no money that the young high
waymen were afraid he would bring
some one to his aid and he was admon

robbed.

ALAMEDA COUNTY JAIL.
September 29. 1905.
Mr. White: About two years ago I was in
Sunday-school, when the minister gave out
gome cards to the boye and girls. "' The cards
were to raise money for the missionaries. 1
thought I could get some money off them, so
I stole some from the back room of the church.
I tried it and cot a little bit of money off
them. The people you asked were to give 10
cents and sim their names. One day a lady
save me a. do liar. I had no change, so I eaid
1 would get" on the car, which was Just passing,
and get change. The conductor misunderstood
me and rung in a fare and gave me a trans
fer, to Instead of walking back, as I should
have done, I kept on going. That was my first
trouble at Twenty- tlrird: -avenue.
About two month? after;. thai I paid rent on
a wheel ''in .Fruitvale "for 'one hour and kept
the wheel out "air U'ay.^.a'ndTat night time I
put the wheel \u25a0 back -about â¢ a ' -block from the

STEALS DIAMOND.
. About a year ago I eiw Fred Bauten. ray
next-door neighbor's boy, with a ring on his
finger, t asked him to let me cc* it. He
Bald his. mother let him have it. to play with
and he must not lose it.- ;
He Ut me ccc it, and I noticed it wai a'
diamond rinr, but the diamond vis very
dirty and I thought It. was a. paste. When I
wa& looking at it I unintentionally dropped It
on 'my Itwn. We looked- for It fer- about an
hour, but ' could not find it. He thought that
I tried to steal it, so he began to cry and
said he would tell. I Rave him $2 that I had
with me and told him to say he lo* t It. About
three days after, I lost my tennla ball on
the- front lawn, and when I was bunting It 1
ran across the nnr already epoken of. I told
Fred and he said I could keep 'it, but not to
let Ms folks ccc it and to say nothing about
it to any one. I told my brother Jim, and
said I was going to cell it to a Jeweler. -He
paid I would get caught. So I showed the
ring to him, and he cleaned it with tome al
cohol on a toothbrush till it shined very
brightly. Jim offered me $2 for it, and I
would not sell It. so he said if I did not sell
it to him for $5 he would tell all about it. So
I sold it to him. Then he gave it to his girl.
Virginia Qulgley, as an engagement ring.
About a year ago this month Percy Pemb
roke came up to my house and was talking
to Jim about an. hour. That was on a Mon
day nteht, wfcen my : folks:, went to the Re
bekah Lodge â¢ at* Brooklyn. I was playing on
my piano, arid ' I played very Â«oftly and heard
Pembroke talking about holding up some
body. He wanted -Jim to go with him. Jim
tried to back out. . but when Pembroke told
him it was easy money, Jim and Percy made
plans for "the next" night' my folks went to
lodge. The next time, niy folks went away
Jim told me he was ; going out with Percy to
hold somebody up and he wanted me to stay
home and keep, three dt * the lights burning
and to jjiay the piano - till he came home, so
as to make it look as if he 'was in the house
all nleht. When Jim came home he gave me
$3 60, which he owed me. He would not tell
me at the time who it was that they held up.
Two or three nights after, Pembroke i told me
it was a barber by the name of Stanley. I told
Jim what Percy said and he ackuowledged it.
UK FIRST . HOLD-UP.
About a week after, Jim -and George Blaker
and I were all three in my house cooking pan
cakes, ar.d Jim called me and we left Blaker
in the bouse,* while Jim' and I went out 10
try and' hold up somebody. We went down
Twenty-fourth avenue jas far as Nineteenth
street, when we met Mr. Thomson and we
followed him to his bouse. Jim did not want
to hold up 'the man because he, was afraid that
the man would recognize us. So we .stayed In
between Twenty -first and Twenty, secend
streets, in the shade of the trees, until a young
fellow came along singing and with an um
brella in his band, as it was Juet through
raining." ]We walked behind him â¢ for a \u25a0 short
distance and then caught up. and passed him.
When we were about three or four I feet in
"*ront of him we turned around and Jim" put
. the gun into , bis face and Jim said : "You
throw up your, hands!" The fellow , was '/very,
scared and threw hie hands and his umbrella
in them way up In the air. He began talking
very loudly about not having any money on
him. He talked so loud that Jim made him
shut up, as he was afraid of people hearing
him and coming. I went through him and
founi $1 50. Jim passed me the 60 cents and
kept the dollar. Jim then told the fellow not
lo breathe a. word of it and to keep on going
home. .Jim and I ran Into our house. We
did not tell Blaker anything about It until it
KAid in the paper the next evening that a
young man by the name of George W. Goody
wu held up and robbed of Jl 60 between Twen
ty-third and Twenty-second streets on.Twenty
fourth avenue. Thtn Blaker knew - that it
must have been us. ' Then we : told him all
about it and told him not to say anything
about it. '\u25a0\u25a0 .
The next night my folks went to lodge, Jim
and I walked downtown along Webster to the
Sacred Heart Convent, then down a street to
San Pablo avenue, down San Pablo to the
theater. \u25a0 We followed a few *ich .men '-, who
-were Jingling gold in their pockets. We could
not get them, so we followed a man down Sev
enteenth street Into West Oakland. He went
into a house ; before we . got him. Then right
?.croes the street a man who looked like Judge
Geary came out of a house. We followed him
up to tbe postofflce. ,Ue turned out to be a

went to Adeline street and went down ' Adeline

We. walked up Eighth street to Jeff ervon ani

OAKLAND, Sept. 2Â».â There Is nothing
more attractive \u25a0 than' a -crowd of beautiful
â¢ women, beautifully ', gowned,' and the Stoip
hume on Lake " street presented a charming
picture to-<lay, while Mrs. Gordon M. Stolp
received her guests at one of the most bril
liant events ot the season. Artistic floral
adornments formed an adequate background
for the animated groups of pretty women, and
as thÂ« home Is delightfully situated on Lake
Merrltt,. the outlook from the windows added
much to the general pleasing effect.
At least 200 guests called during the after
noon. The hostess was assisted by a large
receiving party and many of the gowns would

jin his prayers and admire. Mrs. Stolp herself
i wore one of . the prettiest, a rich violet bro
cade, trimmed with a rare-lace and clusters
of violets. Her daughter-in-law, Mm. Fred
Stolp, one of. Oakland's most charming young

His lief uge; After He Kills;
; His Young, Soldier Kival
SAN . LEANDRO, Sept. â¢ 29.â Daniel
Schmidt,, a truck; farmer;" of Fruitvale,
visited the County Infirmary this, after
noon in search of information concerning
John. Brooder, who,. he said, had recently
fallen heir to a. comfortable fortune'in his
native town in Germany. * ;
The German Consul in San Francisco
has the matter in charge and has been
trying to find Brooder. In . an examina
tion of the records by Druggist Smith
it was found- that Brooder. had, been an
inmate of the: infirmary, but that he died
two years ago, and as the body was not
claimed the remains were buried in the
potters field. He was 72 years of age.
According to a story told of Brooder he
was. the son of wealthy and influential
parents, who owned' large estates in the
neighborhood' , of. Breslau, Germany.
When a young man he was sent to the
university at Berlin. It was while pursu
ing his studies at that place of learning
that .he became acquainted with a young
woman who formerly lived in his home
town. News of his attentions to~the girl
reached his parents about the same time
it got to the ears of a young soldier, who
also belonged in Breslau, but who had
joined the' army and had been doing gar
rison duty for some time and had not
seen the girl. â¢Â«
- Brooder was notified that he must cease
his attentions to the girl or fight a duel
with the soldier lover. He was not long
in deciding, and sent word /to the soldier
that he would meet him at a certain point
at a specified- time. The weapons were to
be pistols. The men met and the soldier
received a mortal wou*nd. To escape ar
rest young Brooder fled the country and
came to America.' Though well educated,
his pathway was not strewn with roses,
and he was often compelled to seek me
nial work to get a livelihood. Finally he
drifted to the x gold fields in this State and
amassed a considerable fortune, but . in
later, years unwise speculation caused hi 3
fortune to melt, and when he was taken
sick a few years, ago he was compelled
to seek the shelter of the County Infirm
ary. He was well known among the older
residents of the county.
BRITISH GOODS
UNDER THE BAN
â¢ CALCUTTA, Sept. 29.^ â Fifty thousand
Bengalis, assembled at the Temple of
Kall^hat/have sworn by the Goddess
Kali to boycott British, goods as a pro
test against the partition of the pro
vince of Bengal. The administrative
work. of the province, according to the
views of the Home and Indian Govern
ments had sriown to such unwieldy
proportions as to necessitate a division
of the labor, nonce tho partition of .the
province into two lieutenant-governor
ships. The Bengalis ' are intensely re
sentful at what they characterize an
attempt to split the population and im
pair theJÃengalis nationality. At scores
of meetings throughout Bengal the peo
ple pledged themselves to support the
boycott, which has now received the
sanction of the priests.
The scene at the Temple of Kalighat,
the greatest in Bengal, was striking
when the Immense assemblage took
the oath "In the holy presence of the
Goddess Kail not to use foreign goods,
buy articles in foreign shops when
available in native shops or employ
foreigners on any work that can be
done by our countrymen." The high
priest then placed a mystic vermillion
symbol on the forehead of each of
those who, took . the oath. Foreign
firms are all feeling seriously the ef
fect of the boycott. - {-S'S'^

PORTLAND, SepL 29. â Joseph Pryor.
editor of a paper In Sausalito, has come
into a fortune of about $400,000.
Mr. and Mrs. Pryor came to Portland
some time ago^to attend the exposition
and during the early part of their stay
received a telegram stating, that an
uncle of Mrs. Pryor had died in the
East, leaving a large fortune iv which
the couple were to share. The news
paper man and his lucky wife went to
investigate. After having been con

\u25a0weftk returned to Portland to continuft
their visit.
Pryor brought with him drafts
amounting to $067,000 and t stated that
the. property included in the estate had
not as yet been divided. The editor
says he has not made any plans to
spend the newly acquired money.
"MASKED BALL"
IS ENJOYABLE
1 -
Nervous, but intensely spirited, was the
performance of the "Ballo.ln llaachera"
at the Tlvoli last night.. As with the "H
Trovatore," with "La Traviata," Polacco
has completely revivified the . opera. It
has never found much favor here, and ;
last night's house was only a modest one.
Yet the "Ballo in Maschera," with its dra
matic story and -wealth of tine aria 3 and
concerted masterpieces, becomes in Signor
Polacco's spirited and significant reading
wholly worth hearing. The audience evi
dently thought so last evening, being
vastly complimentary in its appreciation.
-A. cast almost as weighty as that of
"Les Huguenots" is demanded by the
opera, and one was more than once re
minded of that wonderful cast Mr. Grau
gave "Les Huguenots" here, at least so
far as those delightful conspirators Dado
and Gravlna went-the De Reszke and
Plancon of the Tivoli. The conspirators'
chorus and the trio bet%en Moreo. Dado
and Gravina was Indeed a stunning bit of
singing. Moreo was not in best vocal
trim, but his Renato was as always. an
artistic performance. . , V*.v
' Coppola was the Ricardo, and mighty
therein. He sang "splendidly, acted
capitally, and altogether made a triumph
ant figure. Some little lack of color in
the voice makes itself felt, but one grows
â¢> only -more- cmteful. /or. the infallible
pitch, for the fine phrase, for â¢ the ex
quisitely accurate enunciation that char
acterize the tenor's sinffing.
Petrella sang the Amelia with all the
tragic force that seems to be within her
gift. ' Miss Petrella has a voice in a
thousandâ but she is not yet a singer
in a thousand. Brilliant, ringing, round
from end to end. and sweetens itself, the
Petrella voice lacks no quality of beauty.
But it becomes more apparent that the
singer lacks firmness In tone, fineness In
phraseâ or possibly one would better, say
authority. Happily she has many years
to achieve these, and with a dramatic
gift that has already given us a Santuzza
second only to Calves and tne splendid
Petrella voice, everything may be hoped
tOT -' '" ' * .
Miss Grassl was the sorceress, and et
! fective as good acting and a chocolate
! contralto . with . a tremolo curdle could
make it. Miss Lucchini might have been
worse as the page. Perhaps not much.
The chorus did nobly as usual.

OAKLAND, Sept. 29.â "Actions like

SHIKT BLAME FOR RIOT
Believe Affairs Would Go
More Smoothly if They
Had Control of the Hall
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Sept.- 29.-
On account or the action of" tbe faculty
committee on student affairs in removing
from the men's dormitory a number or
students, many of whom have had noth
ing- to do with the recent riots in Encini>
Hall, the remainder of the student body
has brought so much pressure to bear
on the chairman of the faculty committee
and on President Jordan that "they hAva
agreed to give every student concerned in
the trouble an individual hearing and to
allow those who can 3how that they wera
in no way connected with the disturb
ances to remain in the dormitory. ,"
A committee of students spent a ! largÂ©
part of last evening In consultation with
President Jordan, who said that 'he was
opposed to the watchman Jn the dor
mitory being allowed to carry a revolver,
and that he would recommend to> the
board of trustees of the university that
the armed watchman be removed.'
The present trouble has given rise to a
general agitation for student control In
the dormitory, and it is probable that the
final result of the recent trouble will be
the placing of responsibility for good or
der in the dormitory In the hands of the
upper classmen. Dr. Jordan favors this
plan on condition that the students- be
financially responsible for any damage to
the furniture In the building.
The students are unwilling' to shoulder
such a burden, but it is very probable
that a compromise will be reached where
by the men in the dormitory will be given
more freedom and at the same time cause
less trouble than heretofore. '%*Â£ '-
The following editorial, which appeared
in last night's Issue of the Daily Palo
Alto, is an expression of the student*'
side of the controversy:
As a result of a disturbance ' In Encln*
Hall on Tuesday night over twenty men have
bftn - requested .to leave tbe dormitory by ta"
evening: at t> o'clock. A list oC names wÂ« Â£
posted In the hall this morning. These men
\u25a0were summoned before the chairman ot the
(tudent affairs committee and told that they
\u25a0would have to leave the dorngtory.
Another point Is that the Knen were given
; no bearing before the comralttw and were
not allowed to explain what part they took
in the affair or whether they took . any part
at all. That & man should be thus thrown
out of the dormitory without a chance to say
a word for himself will surely not receive
the approbation of the student body. That
the innocent should be puniatied along with
the wrongdoers seems a poor plan and yet
- this seems to have been the case.
Going back to the root of the affair, the
person who is originally partly to blame is
the ' one who ensrszed the watchman. This
watchman U totally unfit for his place. And
It stands to reason that the students wonlj
not rise up- and create the disturbance that
they did without any cause. . The pust stands
a* ample proof of this fact.
Mow, would it .not be better for the uni
versity authorities -to placÂ« control of -the
ball; In the- hands -of 'the students \u25a0 themselves,
with - a comisiitee selected from their num
ber who will deal with all case* that arise?
A sort of honor system should be Installed
and the watchman withdrawn. The system.
o? spying In .force here cr*atss antagonism
and hard feeling and does far more harm than
good. The students should be. treated as men.

Deputy Collectors Charles Stephens and
Ellis Holmes leave to-day for Monterey
and San Luis Obispo, respectively, to
enter and clear vessels engaged In the
oil trade and to save for the owners of
Ehips and liquid fuel some valuable time.
Accompanying each deputy collector will
be a Federal surgeon, so that the quar
antine, as well as the customs formali
ties, may be observed at these sub-ports
of this district. Time seems to be more
highly valued In the\oil trade than in
any other business, and as a result the
officers s,nd crews of oil carriers see very
little of s&ore life.
At Ban Luis Obispo, Holmes will enter
the steamer Argyle and the barkentine
Fullerton. which is towing up from Hon
olulu. A few hours In port will be all
the time necessary for both Argyle and
PuUerton to pump out the water ballast
and fill their tanks with oil, when
Holmes will clear the vessels for the re
turn trip to Honolulu and almost before
the Ink on the entering papers Is dry,
the twe vessels win be oit to sea, beaded
lor the Territory of. Hawaii.
The Rcsescraos and the schooner Mon

to Monterey. The Rosencrans, for per

Gipey lsjhed to a lighthouse. The Rose
crans arrived here September 9 from
Nome. Although !t was a legal holiday,
the demands of the oil trade had secured
epeclal permission for the constructive
opening of the Custom House. She en
tered and at the came time cleared for
Honolulu. She sailed September 10. She
is now coming back from Honolulu to
Monterey, where she will stay only long
enough Tor quarantine sjid customs in
spection and for the changing of her
water ballast for liquid fuel. Then back
she goes for Honolulu. On this trip she
will .take the BChooner Monterey in tow.

SATURDAY .'. SEPTEMBER 30, iÂ°Os
THE ARMY CANTEEN.
THERE is in session in Detroit one of the most important
medical and surgical conferences that has ever met. The dele
gates to it are army and navy surgeons from many nations.
Naturally the subject of the greatest interest is what Japan has
taught the world in army sanitation. That country is represented
by Dr. Suzuki, Surgeon ' General of the Japanese navy, whose ad
dresses have been of the greatest interest, because he immediately
represents the Japanese system and its achievements.
Respecting infection from battle wounds, he says it is caused
principally by carrying into the wound the soiled underclothes of
the victim. The many surgeons under his orders experimented to
prove or disprove this theory. They, made the war crews bathe
and put on clean underclothes before going into battle. Those
who did this escaped septicemia, while those who did not devel
oped it. As a result all crews were sent into battle bathed and with
clean underclothes, and blood poisoning was reduced to a minimum.
It was developed that in all other respects of diet, drink, camp
drainage and rest the most minute attention was given by the med
ical staff to the sanitary needs of the soldiers and sailors. This
called pointed attention to the slack methods pursued in the armies
of other countries, and brought to the front the effect upon the
health and morals of our army of the abolition of the army canteen.
Many officers and many surgeons Â¥ hold that our soldiers should
be protected against drinking and debauching in the deadfalls that
surround every army post. They believe that the soldiers are as
much entitled to such protection as they are to medical treatment
when their excesses bring them to the hospital. In other armies
than our own it is believed that our former system of the army can
teen was the best possible for the health and morals of the privates.
It dispensed only light wines and malt liquors, with such articles
of food as the Soldier needs to eke out his regular ration. The
profits were invested in a fund for the support of a library, reading
and recreation room, so that the canteen became the post club of
the private soldiers. The enlisted men will have some recreation
10 relieve the monotony of the drill and discipline of army life.
They are part of a military machine, and wear a uniform, but they
are human, like the rest of us, and crave the same opportunity for
variety.
Wbile this military medical conference is meeting at Detroit,
the annual Diocesan convention of the Episcopal church is- in ses
sion in Xew York, and has had before it the same question in a dif
ferent form. Bishop Potter's charge was devoted entirely -to Sunday
observance. There is lamentation in the churches because Ameri
can laboring men do not attend church on Sunday. This is not
because the workman must mingle with the millionaire at church,
or because the pulpit supports the pretensions of the rich, which it
does not. The reason is a very simple and a very human reason,
that has in it no irreligion nor wickedness. It is because the work
man, after the monotony of six days' toil, needs recreation which
i:> restful to him. He seeks it on Sunday, and as a rule shares it
with his family. Bishop Potter recognized this human need and
declared that the Xew England rigidity of the Sabbath cannot be
brought back by blue laws.
The two matters merge in this common need of recreation after
monotony. When we reach a point at which the minister will go
with the people to their Sunday recreation, making a pleasant ex.
hortation regarding the great issues of life a feature in their day
of resr, the excesses which now defile the day's rest will gradually
disappear. When the enlisted man in the army can indulge in com
paratively harmless drinks and wholesome refreshments, and enjoy
harmless games and the advantage of books and newspapers in the
canteen used as his post club, he will cease seeking the vicious
indulgence in poison liquor and still more poison associations in the
deadfalls which pervert his natural desire^ for recreation.
The conference of military -surgeons passed unanimously a reso
lution asking the restoration of the canteen. We think that oppo
sition to it is misguided reform. The excellent people who induced
Congress to abolish it were theorists only. They knew but little of
the conditions that prevail at army posts. They were not all quali
fied for the judgment they assumed the right to render. They need
a share of the spirit in which Bishop Potter considered the subject
of Sunday recreation. \
PARTRIDGE ACCEPTS.
MR. PARTRIDGE accepted the Democratic nomination for
Mayor in a speech, if possible, more notable than his accept
ance of the Republican nomination. His two speeches
abound in pointed epigrams and war cries that utter the spirit of
reform with no false note. An attempt is made by his enemies
to whisper him out of public confidence, by charging him with in
sincerity, but an insincere man could not talk as he does, nor make
the sacrifice he makes in leading this fight.
In his speech to the- Democratic convention he struck out the
situation in one sentence: "Partisanship is forgotten as if there
were a hostile fleet outside the Golden Gate." The morals of the
movement were uttered in this lofty sentence: "I would like to
meet every young man who is tempted to graft and say to him he
would.b etter strike off his right hand than stretch' it forth to re
ceive the wages of corruption; easy money makes a hard bed."
Again he said: "I have been a Republican all my life, yet I stand
here as the proud nominee of a Democratic convention. I deserve
â¢nothing from you or from the people of San Francisco unless you
believe that lam going to bend all the energies. of my soul to the
task of regeneration of municipal government. I am going to try

A DELEGATE'S WAIL.
OH, my back has a;pain and my side
has an- ache, arid" my .head has a
notion to crack or to break, and
a doctors prescription I frequently take,
And I judge that I hardly need mention.
.Considering the sable that shows on my
eye, and the fact that I wake from my
dreams with a sigh; and'often at nothing
in evidence shy,- - ;\u25a0â¢- ;.'.; .'. .
That "I Went to ttie recent convention.
A " friend got a Eeat in the gall-ry for
me, for he said, ."lt's<a patriot's duty to
bee just. how things are run in the land
of the free," \u25a0 . ... . ...
And I thought it an excellent notion.
Then I sat ort a chair near some people
unknown, and a gentleman' roÃe and he
said, "For my own dear country I move â "
Then he sank with a moan,
Thqugh perhaps 'twas an excellent no
tion.; .
For a great, burly chap whom he never
had met then landed his list in a style I

Then an officer came with a hand like
a mit, and a manner proclaiming, 'T
really am it"â though why he arrested
the chap that was hit
As a* fact I have never discovered,)
Then the gall'ry arose with a howl and
a shriek, and seventeen members endeav
ored to speak, and the one that succeed
ed won out on his "cheek," .
f For he roared like a critter of Bashan;
And I cried, "Whoop! Hooray for the
land of the free!" till a seven-foot ruf
fian then turned upon me, and he fiercely
remarked, "It doesn't go! See!"
And he seemed in a terrible passion.
And whatever else happened I really
don't know, for when I revived from that
.terrible blow I was under arrest and I
felt very low,
And somewhat in need of salvation.
And if this is the style in the land of
the free, I 'would only remark that it's
clear unto me when future conventions are
held, don't you see,
That a jail were their proper location.
If "de boss" and "de gang," the heeler
and thug, the slick politician of manner
o'ersmug, can into conventions their dev

And 1 judge that they can for they

Why, it's time for the decent to rise in
their might, and grafter and rounder in
righteousness smite, for the tree will not
grow if surrendered to blight,
And we'll only neglect it to rue It.
"What I want." soliloquized Nicholas,
as a hand grenade blew the window sill
into tiny bits and fractured the ceiling
into fragmentsâ "what 1 want is more
peace and less pieces."
Then Nicholas occupied a lull between
explosions by weeping bitterly, and as he
did so the little lurking echoes seized the
latter word and tossed it back and forth
among themselves until it finally passed
from the room in what seemed a low
chuckle of demoniac laughter. ,
"What's the matter with Bjones?"
"He's in a bad way." \u25a0
"Yes, but what's the matter with him?"
"Why, lie read an announcement of the

A CHAT COXCERXIIVG POLITICS.
You say, Adolphus, that you are going
into politics, and immediately after that,
1 judge, the political atmosphere. is going
to be. largely purified and clarified. In
behalf of the great, public 1 hereby ex
press thanks to you for this noble de
cision on your part.
And yet, now that I come to think of it,
I have known several young men who
went into politics in order to purify and
clarify it, and still politics has- a smell of
its. own. You \u25a0: see, these â¢\u25a0 noble young
men went into the game, and then- the
most of them either held their noses and
backed out or betrayed a fondness for the
sort of smell they noticed. In .other
words, the latter had case-hardened
olfactory nerves.
I do not wish you to understand that
I think there-are.no decent men in poli
tics. We have our Roosevelts, our Folks,
our -a. Follettes '-'and that*, ilkâ and the
American people ought; to thank heaven
every night that Ithis Is . the caseâ but I
have found nobody to \ doubt that they
are In a splendid minority. The "profes
sional politician" generally is not of their
sort; his odor is not the, same.
You will do quite right to -"go into pol
itics," for every. man owes that much to
his country, but' unless you are very sure
of the quality of'your moral backbone, do
not become a professional at present. I

DAME FASHION'S MIRROR.
SIMPLICITY IN EVENING BODICE.
THE separate waist, which has had such a long and popular reign,
seems in no wise to be losing favor, and Is this season to be very
\u25a0much worn in combination with soft silk and velveteen skirts for
evening wear. Many of these waists are made with separate lingerie
yoke and cuffs, tnus permitting of the waist being worn low-necked and
short-sleeved' for evening, if the wearer bo desires. This model of a
pale blue crepe de chine, with .tiny black polka dots. Is extremely
simple, its only trimming beir^g a band of Irish crochet lace as a head
ing to the shirrs at yoke depth. The fullness over the bust, line is
drawn easily into the. narrow, belt of velvet ribbon, and the double
puff sleeves are finished with a frill of the goods.

A JEW'S EYEâ S.'A., Middleton, Cal.
There is no certainty about the origin of
the expression, "Worth a Jew's eye." In
Nare's Glossary there is the following:
"The exactions to which the Jews were
subjected in the thirteenth century and
periods both before and after exposed
them to the most cruel and tyrannical
mutilations if they refused to pay the
sums demanded of them. The threat of
losing an eye would have a powerful . ef
fect, hence the high value of a Jew's
eye." The expression is ,a popular one,
intending to convey the meaning' that
something is of priceless value. .

GOOD DRESSING
ANGELA MORGAN
KEEPING dressed upâ how we mor
tals rebel against It! How vigor
. ously ; small Susie protests,
screaming and stamping, when her hair
is ' combed;- ,- how Johnny kicks and
snarls when face- washing time comes
round; how father fumes and swears
over unyielding shirt bands and * re
fractory collar buttons, and how RAof
mother sighs and fusses over skirt fas
tenings that won't fasten and hooks
and eyes mat refuse to be friends! : ;
Ana what jubilation there is when a
vacation in the countryâ the real coun
try â -affords release from restraint, fur
inality and starchy things!
; What joy to*go about in lazy comfort,
no longer begirdled, beflounceil, berib
boned and becollared! \
And yet-f-let us admit the truth. It
would be unfortunate indeed if we were
allowed such freedom, every day.
Rusticating jis all right in vacation
time; being free from the "burden of
dressing" is good lor us at intervals;
but it is well that we are not permitted
for very long periods to indulge our
lazy propensities.
I The longing to throw off restraint
and to escape the necessity of "keep
ing dressed up" Is the cry of the primi
tive in us and should not be allowed to
dominate our tendencies toward civili
zation.
We need the discipline of "keeping
dressed up." The compulsion that re
quires us to be careful of our personal
appearance and that keeps us on the
alert lest our skirts fray at the hem
and sag in the back livery, very good
for us.
It is well that collars and ties, pins
and girdles, occupy a share o$ every
day's activities. It is through "bother
ing" with these difficulties and others
like them that we are kept in the cur
rent of civilization.
Superficial as it may sound, attention
to looks and dress Is one of the allies
of human advancement. Keeping alert
about one's personal appearance helps
one to keep alert about other^things.
Observe carefully and you will see
that the woman who "eaaes down" in
the ; matter of her looks soons "eases
down" in her aims and aspirations
along other lines.
When a woman grows indifferent as
to the hang of her skirt and the fit of
her waist; when it is no longer a mat
ter of interest to her whether her col
lar is pinned straight or crooked, you
may be sure that woman's mentality
is sagging somewhere and will soon
sag in innumerable place*. -
The woman who "lets herself" go as
to clothes and who cares not about the
arrangement of her hair shows a dis
tinct lack mentally â yes, and in a
sense, morally. For who will contend
it is moral to neglect the appearance
of the soul's habitation? And who will
say any one has an , all-round mental
development who has no patience, no
accuracy, in dressing?
You may talk all you like about
your gifted, clever, eccentric woman
friend, who ha 3 so many important
matters to consider that her brain can
not accommodate so superficial a
thought as dress, and who would not
condescend to waste time pinning a veil
or hooking a girdle.
The woman who hasn't enough ambi
tion, accuracy or gumption to get her
clothes on correctly is deficient in one
department of mentality, at least. Often
she is lazy; .yes, out and out lazy â so
far as that one particular kind of ef
fort is concerned. /
It requires too much exercise of will
to "keep up"; too great attention to de
tails and to. pins" that must be put in
"just so."
I care not how cleverly your friend
plays or writes, sings or recites, nor
how fluently she discusses Ibsen,
Maeterlinck or Bernard Shaw. No mat
ter what her gifts! If she has not the
gift of making herself presentable, at
tractive, sweet, she lacks, and lacks
grievously.
What you term eccentricity in her
you would call just "plain slovenliness
in a woman without talents. But
talents do not beautify her fault.
This same verdict applies to the man
who neglects his personal appearance,
whether through lack of ambition,
laziness or the mistaken idea that such
efforts are of small importance.
-Attention to looks, to dress, when be
stowed with reason, is a means to the
development of several virtues. There
is mental and moral discipline In it.
So It is good we may not rusticate
and be lazy every day. It Is good cus
tom requires us to be carefuljas to our
attire. It may not always be comfort
able. In the words of small Susie, who,
after the maternal scrubbing with soap
and water, declares she hates the "feel
of being clean," it may seem "sort o*
stiff." But the odds are in favor of
the "stiff feeling" so far as progress
and development go.
So go back to your pins and your
hooks and eyes; your dressmakers and
tailors; your collars, ties and girdles.
Smile at fhe discipline and accept It, 'for
it is good. . V ; -
DICTATION'S PERILS
WALLACE RICE
HERBERT SPENCER records of his
own writings that he found it
- \u25a0possible, upon the revision of. his
works, to compress all that he
had dictated within two-thirds of its or
iginal space, while that composed more
laboriously by his own pen admitted of
no such brevity.
It seems to be the individual instance
of a fact of almost universal application.
Time Js money to the business man,
and the wonderful advances of commerce
in recent years are due almost as much
to time-saving devices as to labor-saving
machines. â¢\u25a0'\u25a0'.-\u25a0*. ': .
To make his correspondence as succinct
as possible the man of business has In
vented a number of abbreviations gener
ally understood, by which he seeks to
compress thought. Yet with this has
gone: the use of the. stenographer and
typewriter for purposes of dictation.
The result is surprising. The average
letter so composed Is hot merely made
bad English jby the . introduction of com
mercial slangâ to say notning of the or
thographic and grammatical vagaries of
the ; half-instructed shorthand writerâ but
it is almost Impossible to find one that is
not loaded full of needless words and
phrases. : ";
Every such word is a loss of time of the
more serious character.. \u25a0 : It wastes the
time of a man \ dictating, of. the person
taking and transcribing such dictation and
of the correspondent' who has to read it
âdoubly | so, \u25a0: in ;. this ; last case, for i every
unnecessary ' word obscures the sense
even more than it incumbers the page.
â¢There is no" time In- modern business for
revision,, except such as-, a . thoroughly
trained â¢ stenographer can herself effect.
There is the fatal facility with which dic
tated .words flow out upon the world.
But i the evil, once realized, can be met
and overcome in the person dictating i by

CANNERS HEAR
ABOUT BOYCOTT
Agents at Hongkong v of
the California Association
Send ' Facts in a Letter
CANTON IS THE HOTBED
City Is Placarded by tlie
Coolie Class and Great
Excitement Is the Result
.The California Fruit CannerÃ' Associa
tion- has received a communication from
Its agents in Hongkong that contains
several interesting facts relating , to J hap
penings during the Chinese boycott
against American goods.: Incidentally the
Hongkong agents tell of a ! gross insult
that was offered to Miss Alice Roosevelt
In papers in the Chinese language in
Hongkong" and Canton. Cartoons were
published. - and this resulted in the ban
ishment of the editors and owners of the
publications for a period of five years. A
part of the communication is as follows:
The matter of the boycott haÂ« been taken up
from, this .slde-'by prominent^ merchants at
Shanghai and" Hongkong, and , through this
comÂ«nlttÂ»Â«j we understand tne President was In-
duc^d to wire the Secretary of War while here
to take up the matter if possible with this Vice
roy of tlie Kwanstung' and Kwangsl provinces,
as Canton .has seemed the hotbed' of the whola
niatttr. It is believed by many people here
that the " Chinese in tven San Frariblsco and
Honolulu are more .or less "responsible for. the.
present, movement. .. -\u25a0'\u25a0
'Upon the" Chinese learning that It. wag the
intention of the "committee to visit Canton thÂ»y.
became very hostile' in. th* cries of- "down, with
the Americans!" This, or courso, emanated
from â¢ the " rabble and coolie class at' Canton.
The : city was .placarded by irresponsible \u25a0 par
fles and the feeling ran so nigh that thÂ« Vice
roy haS -advised with Consul General Lay at-
Canton and thought that It would bÂ« best for
the committee not "to visit Canton at thlÂ« tlm*,
as the authorities" thought tney could not con
trol the mob. , ' â¢>
-.However, upon Ihe.arriy&l of Air. Taft and
party he decided that he must go, even If
there, wna .danger, and- accordingly .they left
lure, for a da-y in Canton. They were received
in -a very -nice, manner, but v went no further
than, .the Shameen. The Shameen is the island
set apart Trom the Chinese city of Canton for
foreign" residence and is connected- with the. old.

Rafael Links.
The first match-play round of the sec
ond competition during the present sea
son . for the | Council's cup for men of the
San Rafael Golf Club, will take place
'to-day" on the course In Happy Valley.
The eight players who qualified last Sat
urday â¢in the medal play rounds *art
matched as, follows: J. J. Crooks vs. R.
B. Hellman; Douglas Hardy vs. W. J.
Casey; R. J. Davis vs. Dr. F. W. Skaife,
and A." S. Lilley vs. Dr. H. O. Howitt.
What Is called "the greatest golf match
of modern times" was begun last month
on the St. Andrew's course between Har
ry Varden and J. H. Taylor, Englishmen,
and James Braid and Alexander Herd,
Scotchmen, for J2OOO. The great interest
shown In this international foursome is
indicated by the fact that there' were
10.000 spectators. Only once did this great
cro^d impede a ball, though it did some
times manifest its pleasure too plainly
when one of the Englishmen failed to do
what he attempted. On the first morning
Braid scarcely made a defective shot, he
and his partner finishing the round in
37. 3S. totalTS. while the score of the Eng
lishmen was 29, 39, total 7S. Only ' one
ball went into a bunker on either side.
The Scotchmen were 3 up * on the first
eighteen holes.
In the second round the- Scotchmen
made a few errors, which . Vardon and
Taylor- quickly- took advantage of. The
Englishmen went round In 76 (to 78 for
tbe ; Scotchmen) and were 2 down on the
first day's play.
The second stage of the match took
place on the course of the Troon Club
at Troon. which skirts the shores of the
Firth of Clyde. The line of play and the
greens were guarded by nearly a hundred
stewards and policemen, flags being used
to indicate jto _ those outside the circles
round the green which side had 'won the
hole. The Englishmen played a brilliant
game in all departments, while" the
Scotchmen' failed somewhat in their ap
proaching and putting. On the morning's
play the : englishmen were 6 up or 4 up
on the match. In the afternoon the Eng
lishmen maintained their superiority and
ended the first- two stages of the match
with the. substantial advantage ofr 12 up.
These. -stages., were played in Scotland
and the last two were played In Eng
land, the third at Lytham and St. Anne's
and the' last at Deal. Accounts of these
last two stages are not yet at hand.

CARDINAL MEN

Coach Lanagan Satis
fied With 'the Material
for the Freshman Team
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Sept. 29.â
The largest-freshman squad In the his
tory .of the university is slowly but
surely being weeded .down to two com
pact elevens of expectant youngsters,
who, when they. enter the game with
the University of California two weeks
from to-day, will make as strong a bid
for- the, honors as .has any freshman
team the cardinal has ever produced.
The squads are > just ,.' now passing
through, the most, discouraging: period
of the 'season. ." jAiany^players are "be
ing . retired, and -the 4 - remainder .seem
poor .in comparlsbn.%-.with; their- upper
class comrades on; the 'varsity. All this
Is .an annual occurrence. 'and there Is no
doubt In \the ' mliida ro t! . ihe' coaches
that - the ( team' will- appear! on the ' field

.The squad is well "balanced, there be
ingr.abuftdant material.for the line; sev
eral varsity punters ; a"nd- backs, who
are in ;a class by^ themselves, as com
pared wltli the teams of. last year.
.. :", The past' defeat's .which the - younÂ«-
Bters have encoiintered.iwhen compared
with.the.showing^rietCalifornia fresh
men made, serve >to Vindicate that the
blue and gold aggregation' Is superior.
This comparison is, however, not a fair
one ;by , which tofjudge) the caliber of
the rival .squads/ a.sT : the policy of the
coaches, ln control {yary, radically. Cali

substitutes; * Stanford. has -but one team
and that ;Is â¢ composed V"o- the- entire
squad. Â«,>. \u25a0 - ; "Kf'j'Axv.' \u25a0
The .work of : the.. vaursky is. beyond

PLATEESWELL MATCHED
Gardner, Adams and Janes
Will Be the Stars Among
the Men in Competition
The second annual tennis . v tournÂ£Â».
ment for the championship of the bajf
counties will commence to-morrow on, '
the Golden Gate Park tennis courts.
The first event of the klnd./wa3 held
last October and was won .by Drum
mond MacGavln, who is at present in
South Africa. It Is the last champion
ship event of the year and every crack
In the city Is anxious to carry oft the
honors. A doubles tournament will
also be held, challenge cups havins
been donated by Julius F. Lange. Reu
ben H. Lloyd presented the trophy,
which is emblematic of the singles
championship, to the Golden Gate Club
last year.
Three big championship events have
been held this year and each â¢ devel
oped a new champion. Will the fourth,
and last go to one of the three cham
pions or will still another man come
along, and carry off the honors? Carl
Gardner won the San Francisco cham
pionship in May. Fred Adams annexed
the State championship In July and
George Janes won the coast champion
ship event this month, giving him first
place among 1 the racket wielders.
All three champions undeniably have
an excellent chance to win the Lloyd
Cup. but there are several other play
ers ' who have Â«an equally good
chance. They are Percy Murdock.
George Baker, Herbert Schmidt and
Clarence Griffin. Murdock played in
his old-time form in the doubles at
San Rafael and If he can do so to
morrow he should win. Schmidt is
playing a rattling: good game at pres-V
ent and will be a hard man to beatjb
His victory over Gardner last Sunday
after the latter had taken the coast
champion into camp impressed follow
ers of the game. Schmidt showed
well in practice during the week and,
although be has always been a. dis
appointment in tournaments, he may
live up to his practice game, which 13 <
good enough to beat any of the play
ers . here.
Baker has not been playing up to
form of late, but is likely to upset cal'
culatlons. At one time he was the un
disputed champion of the park.
Young Griffin played good tennis at
San Rafael when he made Fred Adams
extend himself . to win. .It -Is not ex
pected he will win., but he cannot be
denied a chance. IraÃV"
Adams and Janes will prove ,two of
the hardest men to beat. - Janes* * de
feat last Sunday will do him a world
of good. His nervousness has worn
off and he Is anxious to retrieve what
laurels he lo3t on Sunday. Adams, by
the way. has some lost laurels to re
cover also. His unexpected defeat, in
September will spur him on to greatei
efforts to-morrow. The best players
are so evenly matched It would be a
difficult . matter to pick the winner.
Murdock's best game would win. but
he cannot be depended upon to be at
his best. Adams, Janes. Gardner, Ba
ker, Schmidt, Griffin and Murdock are
the players who 'stand the best chance
to succeed MacGavin. â¢
The drawings, which were held
Thursday, proved satisfactory In theJ
doubles, but In the singles most of the*"
best players drew In a half. â¢ The
crack teams are well scattered
throughout the doubles and the . final
rounds will be productive of some
close and exciting; matches.
In doubles the strongest teams look
to be Percy Murdock and C Griffin.
Adams and Janes, Schmidt and Rolfe,
Baker brothers. Whitney and Foley
and Dunlap and Gardner. ,'.?\u25a0
Griffin is a' clever young doubles
player and will probably fclve Mur
dock better support than Hunt did.
Adams and Janes- will be their moat
dangerous opponents and It would not
be surprising If the first bay counties
championship In doubles fell to one of
these two teams. "Whitney and Foley
made an excellent showing at San Ra
fael and also have a good chance to
win.
The California Tennis Club will hold
its annual election of directors to-day.
For the first time In several \u25a0 years
there are more than seven candidates.
The nominating committee placed ten
names on the ticket, which means that
three will- be left. Those on the ticket
are TV. S. MacGavln. Grant M. Smith.
C. G. Kuehn. F.^ S. Mitchell, Dr. Love
grove, Dr. Hill. Dr. Noble. Dr. Hardy.
Dr. Younger and N. BlalsdelL" The
seven first named comprise the present
board of directors. ,; There will be no
proxy voting"; ! only the members prea
ent who sign the xpU to-day will be
allowed to vote. f
Two unfinished tournaments wl\7
probably be completed In â the club
courts to-day. Dr. Noble and J. Wljlte
will meet . In the finals of the fourth
class. In the handicap doubles Mitch
ell and H. Long (owe 15 3-6) vs. Kuehn
and Blddle (8-6). and the winner vs.
Gardner and M. Long (owe 15 3-6) aro
the matches to be played.
There will be a ladies' handicap
singles for 'the Van Vliet Trophy
played oa the park courts to-day. The
Golden Ga^e Club Annex has sent out
notices for the -first annual champion
ship of the bay counties. Mr. Lloyd
has presented the club with a trophy
for. which they will compete on the
11th.

The Angels are beginning to play the
game of shutout now and are making
fail guys out of Uncle's bunch o. peais
at Recreation Park. On Thursday the
ecore v.zs 2 to 0 and yesterday the ante
raised a point In favor of the southern
delegation. Mr. Toxer was mainly re
sponsible for the overthrow of the native
talent, though several clever stunts which
his teammates pulled off helped brine
victory home.
For initance. Cravath made away with
a pretty steal of the plate in the seventh
epasra that practically decided the issue
without further ceremony. Brashear
started by getting a- life when Gochnauer
booted his grounder. Cravath forced him
at second and tore to third when Rosa
walloped one through the infield.
Cravath did not seem to think the
chances of his scoring on a hit were very
pood, so he stalled around third and
1 tfficed up to the plate In a longing man-
Jimmy Whalen was too busy wind
ing uj>--a shoot to notice the antics of
the Angel, who took a lead of about
twenty feet off third and then cut loose
ton a wild sprint for the pan. He arrived
a second before the ball. Shea dropped
it. fout he would have been safe Any
cow. ipgi
In the meantime Ross managed to steal
second and Eagar responded with a drive
over Mohler's head that was good for
another run. In the, eighth round Tim
Flood stung one over the right fleld
fence, which ended the labors of making
runs for the day.
Tozer pitched a game that was much
like the one Baum twirled on the pre
vious day. He had- everything and in
such variety that the Seals could not
fwng on anything that counted." Tozer
had seven chances In the field and none
ef tÂ»m got away" from hirnT""" ' *â¢ ' â
Outside of two \u25a0innings Whalen had the
jro<x:s, but the Angels did enough dam
ace in the seventh and eighth to offset
the brilliant work of Jimmy during the
rest of the contest. Uncle put TVheeler
in to bat for Gochnauer in the eighth,
but he could not make good. Waldron,
got into the game and lasted seven in
nings before his Charley horse bothered
him. While *he was in action he made
B3 of the Seals' three hits.. The score:

SHERIFF'S MEN
IN POSSESSION
Deputies, However, Belease
the Entire Outfit When
a Third Claim Is Made
NOLAN BRINGS' ACTION
Will Try to Collect $5000,
Which Manager Coffroth
Says He Will Not; Pay
i.C? \u25a0 ' â¢ â¢\u25a0\u25a0 ' -.: â¢â¢â¢- â¢ (
. A posse of Sheriff Peter. J." Curtis' j
deputies played , the<. leading "roles last
â¢night -at the -moving > picture - show in '
.Rlechanics'. RIechanics' Pavilion.- : On behalf of Billy '
Nolan' and: Battling Nelson the minions I
of : the law Steized the pictures and ap
paratus ;' to t satisfy a , claim which Nolan
â¢has against Manager. Jim ', Coffroth for
$5600.-- The deputies â released Â» the pictures
and cameras in , a few -minutes and al
lowed the ' show; to \u25a0 proceed.' If Coffroth
puts up a bond to*' cover the attachment j
J to-day, the pictures " will be allowed ;to !
. proceed : on their way. /Otherwise the j
.Sheriff will lock the *n up in his office. i
Yesterday afternoon Nolan filed suit in
the Superior Court to recover JSOQO, which
Coffroth is alleged to have promised him
for his interest in" the moving pictures.
The suit was filed by Charles and
Samuel Shortridge on- behalf of Nolan
and Nelson, â¢\u25a0\u25a0 and is the outcome " of one
of . the various mixups between Caff roth
and Nolan.
The action of the Sheriff's deputies last
night did not come .as a surprise, for
every, one knew Nolan Is Intent on col
lecting his money. - As the pictures are
due sto leave town 'to-day* ne had \ but one
chance 'to -attach Â£ them. U But for a
third claim, which twu '.'made at
the last minute by Miles - Brothers, the
photographers who took , pictures,
they would have been locked. In " the'
Sheriff's office. and the show.fstopped on
the spot 'As there werd 480OJ spectators
in. the house this was -not 1- desirable. .
The promoters .: of ';: the enterprise evi
dently expected the raid by. the Sheriff,
for they carefully concealed most of the
money taken in" at the two^ performances.
When the deputies went "to - the box
office to lay hands . on the coin they , dis
covered that only $140 of the day's re
ceipts \u25a0 was in sight. This amount they
took charge of . '
It Is expected the attachment and the
subsequent suit will result in \ a bitter
fight between '. Nolan and Coffroth. . The
former , swears he will collect that $5000
if he - has : to spend every "cent, he ever
earned. Coffroth does. not go into details
of the deal, j but simply â¢ says he will not
pay ' over | the. money ;and that ' it ' is up to
Nolan to do ; the" : best ; he ..Can , to collect
It. -The pictures do notf/stand'in the name
-of Coffroth,, being nominally;; the property

IS A CERTAINTY
Street Committee of Super
visors Beports in Favor
of Ocean Shore Franchise
. \u2666
PEOPLE ARE SATISFIED
Sharp Fight Between Corbet
and Lerman Over Proposal
of Latter to Make Bid
The Street Committee yesterday aft
ernoon passed favorably on the print
ed ordinance granting a franchise to
the Ocean Shore Railway Company and
oh Monday the matter will come up
before the Board of Supervisors for
final hearing. This approval removes
the last obstacle of the railway com
pany in presenting- its proposition to
the Supervisors, and it is ready to be
gin the construction of tracks as .soon
as the printed ordinance is made a
law. :vVvr:
The decision of the Street Committee
was reached only after a heated dis
cussion between Burke "Corbet, se^ra
tary for the corporation, and J. J. Lor
man, who claims to represent capital
ists interested In the securing or tha
franchise which the Ocean Shore
seems about to get. Lerma'n contended
that the Richmond branch of the roai
should be open to bidding and that tha
committee was granting the franchise
in an illegal manner. This aroused the
ire of. Corbet and he demanded to
know the names of the capitalists who
were anxious to bid for the right to
operate in the- Richmond district.
"I will not tell you." shouted Ler
man.
OFFERS TO BET $0000.
"Then you are either Muffins or you
are representing the United Railroads,"
answered Corbet.
Lerman denied that he was bluffing
and offered to bet $5000 that he would
make a'better proposition than did the
Ocean' Shore. lie left the matter with
the committee.
Tirey L. Ford, attorney for the Unit
ed Railroads, placed another temporary
obstacle in the -path of the Ocean
Shore 'when_he proposed an amendment
to thÂ»x>rdinance which should forbid
the'^iJetitioning cor.poration to collect
fares^in the city' limits, thus prevent
ing its becoming a local competitor.
Corbet maintained that the corpora
tion could not do a. local business un
der the ordinance. He carried the day,
as the' final vote of the commi'.tee
showed. The amendment was not rec
ommended.
SOME PttOTBSTS FILED.
Various protests on the part of
property owners were heard. They
were not many, the corporation's s\-s
tem of buying having proven satisfac
tory to most of the, residents in* ihu
section cut by,, the right of way. Bth
rend Jocst, formerly a member of Â»he
Board of Supervisors and at one time
the holder of the franchise whien the
Ocean Shore now seeks. complained
that the proposed bridge- over Fif
teenth avenue south would damage the
property, all alonjr that district. Peter
Tammany, who owns 3G4 feet fromag-j
on Mission street near CanaK objected
to the raise in grade. He filed a pro
test against the granting- of- th* fran
chise. Mv rt
Jere T. Burke, for the Southern Pa
cific Company, asked to amend tho or
dinance grafting the Santa Fe the
right to lay a spur track on Rhodes
Island street so that the former cor
poration would have equal rlghf3 of
traffic. The application was donioJ.
The ordinance ordering the change
in the proposed pavement of Van Ness
avenue between Fulton and McAllister
streets and between Eddy and Geary
streets from asphalt to ".bitumen was
approved.
The plan to purchase a lot at the
corner of Kearny and Chestnut streets
for the purpose of saving Telegraph
Hill was approved. The expenditure
will be J25.000. '

SUZUKI TALKS
ON CHRISTIANITY
Distinguished Japanese Sur
geon Delivers Address at
the Y. 31. C. A. Convention
ADVISES MISSIONAEIES
Says. They Should Become
Eroader in Their Views
When Teaching His People
DETROIT, Sept. 29.â Intensely dramatic
was the moment to-day when Surgeon
General Suzuki of the Japanese navy,
fresh from the battles of the Japan and
Yellow seas, declared with sincerity bo
fore the Railroad Y. M. C A. Interna
tional Convention that he had been for
twenty years a Christian. Very proudly
he added that his wife and five chlldr^ .
shared his beliefs Tears dimmed rm>:^j|
eyes when the distinguished Japanesil
surgeon told brokenly of the drowning
of another child, his twelve-year-old
daughter, just two days before he him
self had 'been called Into the thick of
tho recent righting.
He had not urged the question of re
ligion In his family, he said, havlnsr
trusted to the guidance of God. His
eldest son had been the first to become
a convert, having been Interested at first
through an accidental visit to a Christian
meeting while walking along the streets
of Tokio. Next his wife had been con
verted through the influence of her son.
and all the family had followed in the
steps of these two.
Struggling to control his emotion. Gen
eral Suzuki declared his faith In the
Christian belief of the future life, say
ing of his little daughter, whom he
mourned, "She has gone to our own
kingdom." Further evidencing bis high
conception of the beauty and power of
the Christian religion. Genera*-- Suzuki
credited the missionaries of Japan with
becoming broader and broader In their
views.
"Those who came first," he said, "were
too deeply concerned about outward ap
pearances. It was a mistake for them
to ask at the very outset. 'Do you
smoke? Do you drink? Do you go to
church?" for we know now that when
one has really entered the church he will
naturally give up the things that are
evil. We want you to send to us good
men who will convert our hearts and
show us the real meaning of Christianity.
"Japan is supposed to be a non-ChrlÂ»
tian. country, but there are many rae\
women and children In Nippon trying
be faithful to the right and to God. I
myself was baptized twenty years ago.
I cannot say that I am a good Chris
tian, but I am a Christian."
Surgeon General Suzuki's earnest words
electrified the convention. The audience
became wild in outbursts of applause. It
was probably the first time that cheers
had resounded in the Central Methodist
Episcopal Church, one of the oldest and
largest houses of worship in Detroit.
With one impulse the crowd struggled to
get nearer to the uniformed, swarthy for
eigner, who stood behind tho preachers
desk. Surgeon General Suzuki looked
about him perplexed. It waa necessary
for John J. McCook of New York, who
was presiding, to. conduct the besieged
speaker through a rear door to the
street.
It v/a*' through -â¢ Robert E. Galley. thÂ«
Young Men's Christian Association secre
tary at Tientsin, that the Japanese sur
geon general was requested to address to
day's convention. General Suzuki had re
lated his story to Galley while they were
crossing the Pacific together. The latter
then, upon finding that the army and
navy surgeons' convention at Detroit,
which Suzuki was coming to attend, and
the railroad Young Men's Christian Asso
ciation convention here would occur at
the same time, notified the promoters of
the latter that the noted Japanese ought
to be requested to speak.

NEW YORK. Sept. 29. â To-day'r stock mar-
U. 1 showed remarkable reÂ»iatance to the
.; .:â¢ t^e In the money market. As loans made
on the Stock Exchange on Friday carry over
\u25a0until Monday this j was practically the last i
<iay of the month for Stock Exchange bor
rowers and coaÃÂ«juentJy making-up day for
previous to the quarterly settlements of Octo
ber 1. The very rtteavy special requirements at
this time in addition to the ordinary demand ]
ror thÂ« quarterly settlements have been so )
\u25a0well understood that the Stock Exchange com- I
ciuc!:y was quite prepared to Â»cc a ti per cent j
rate for call money to-day. When the rate
â¢wfrnt abovft that almost immediately after the
oi*a'.ng the market 1 faltered slightly and there
s4Â±"~t a light eplliine . out of stocks, which
i the price level eomprehessively below
last night. Tiie heavy offeniigs of money
brought into Â°thÂ«? market from some of the |
principal Wall eireej banks by the 6 per cent j
rate carried call loar.s back again to s?i per |
ctr.t. Stocks thereupon recovered and wjien '
thÂ« rate for money went- higher than before!
the stock market wes practically unaffected^ [
To-day's rate was' the highest of the year, \
â¢with the exception of a few loans made s late
ia the afternoon preceding the Good Friday l
holiday, when 7 per cent was quoted to carry
over until the Monday. The equa.-.
BUBtty with which : to-day's flurry mas ac
ctp'^d is due to the .very general hope in
culged in speculative quarters that the ' rate
win promptly relax next week. The: Atehison
and I'ennsyivania bonds subscription payments
Imre expected to be pretty closely confined,; to =
*tif ting 'of book accounts and the procee<3Â« ,
Â»re .expected to be quickly available for re
turr"to'Tiie money market. . The same Is true
of ttie tax payment .to- be made in this. City
next .Monday. The compilation of the cur
rency movement for tfie week makes suf
fltjerrfly plain, however, that other causes than*
Â° t?i*> syndjeatt and - tax t.raDÂ«octiÂ«nÂ» iro to ac-=
coufit for the suffer m.jney market.; Banking
authorities expressed the opinion that on ! the"
â¢ regular 'express movement with the : interior
receipts have about balanced the shipments,
but the sub-treasury hÂ»<l taken from the banks
ur to Thursday eventns $6.6711,000. The â¢Gov

Ftarement. .After this w-eek's bond tra.nsac

subscriptions for October 16 will come o into

the buyers to-day a. little cautious and-La.w

an effort to cause a break. Very, few stocks
came out, however, and about 11 a. m. a sharp
rally began, which lasted ' throughout the day,,
with great activity on all sides. The -poor in
Tecumseh still continues' active and' seems
willing to' take considerable stock. North Butte
held firm all day arqund'49, over one thousand
shares being wanted at the close, with' s,ales
at 49%. One -of the best features in the
market is the' noticeable improvement in .Tam

being good and showing the increased confi
dence which the Investors have in the j sta
bility of the present copper prices.

was general complaint among dealers of the
extreme.; dullness of trade, only the ; fanciest
offerings of â¢ Salinas Burbanks and river goods
receiving any attention. The bulk of the

added to- the : already .< heavy accumulation- of
poor stock. The demand for Onions showed
considerable improvement and they were quoied
at a. narrower racge of ; prices. â¢ i

being more than' sufficient for trade wants.

POLICE STILL SEARCH FOR CLEW
TO DEAD ROBBER'S IDENTITY.
The police of San Francisco and. Oakland are still searching for clews to the identity of the highwayman
killed in West Berkeley Wednesday by Policeman Lestrange. The trio of bandits who opened fire on the officer'
are believed to have disappeared near Stege. All clews 'thus 'far have proved unavailing in shedding light /on the
The police of two cities spent the
entire day yesterday in a vain endeav
or to establish the identity of the thug
who lies in the Oakland Morgue, a
victim of the true and steady aim of
Policeman Lestrange. who killed the
man in a revolver duel with three
other thugs in West Berkeley early
Thursday morning. Clew after clew
has been picked up and run- down by
the police and the detectives are no
nearer establishing: the man's identity.
While the energies of the Oakland de
partment were devoted to following
the clew given by VT. T. Kahler, who
in all probability saw the three thug*
who escaped tfce bullets of the brave
policeman, the men of the local de
partment have had a busy day run
ning down false rumors. From pic
tures of the dead robber published
yesterday in The Call several people
have claimed to recognize him. but
upon being confronted with the body
the identification was not*, made.
One clew still remains to be ' un
raveled, but the police are skeptical
of It 6 verity. A pawnbroker says a
man answering the description of the
robber came into his place and sold a
bicycle, which afterward proved to be
a machine stolen from Oakland.
The police of Oakland have made no
headway in the identification, having
run down several clews without result.
The Investigation will continue in both
cities to-day in the hope that the en
tire gang will be run to earth.
The local police nave joined with
the Oakland force in attempting to es
tablish the identity of the dead thug.
Taking the laundry marks found on
the underclothing of the dead man. De
tectives Freel. Bunner and Silva made
a thorough canvass of the city's laun
dries in the hope of establishing iden
tification. After an all day search, in
which every large laundry was visited,
the detectives were compelled to report
failure.
KELLY HAD THEORY.
Another tip that was followed to a
finish was that of J. Kelly of the firm
of Thomas Kelly & Sons, stable owners,
who thought he recognized the picture
in The Call as that of a man who had
caused trouble at the Pacific Avenue
stables over a month ago. The man, who
\u25a0was known as John Wall, got into an
altercation with Frank Kelly, one of the
linn. nnd after a fierce fight was thrown
out of the p!ace. He went away threat
ening to return with a weapon and clean
out the place, but he failed to put in
an appearance.
The foreman went over to Oakland
ysterday. accompanied by Detectives
Harrison and Graham, but after a view
Â«f the dead man was unable to establish
the Identification.
Several other local people saw the pic
ture in The Call and are positive they
C&n identify the man. Joseph Goldstein
of â¬25 K^arny street says that a man
answering the description^ of the dead
r-obbcr calicd at his pawnbroklng place
last Tuesday and sold him a bicycle for
$7. the receipt being made out to J. Ryan.
G. H. Goldman of 1157 Twenty-fifth street
called at the place the next day and
identified the wheel as belonging to him.
W. T. Kahler, a musician, residing at
36 Telegraph avenue. Oakland, saw two
men yesterday afternoon at the county
lint on the San Pablo road, one of whom
dressed a wound in his arm at the shed
where electric car passengers are trans
ferred to and from the connecting Point
K:cl;;"ind electric road. -Kahler told
Sheriff Birnet to-day that- one of the
men wore a pistol In a holster that hung
by a belt from his shoulder identically
as did the weapon carried by the thug
whom Lestrange shot. At the time he
saw the men Kahler had not learned of
the shooting. To-day he' went with the
Sheriff and Town Marshal Vollmer of
Berkeley over the scene of his meeting
the men yesterday. Kahler'a story sug
sested that one of the gang might have
been shot by one of his companions In
tin fusillade they fired at Lestrange.
They left the car at Stege and disap
peared toward the railroad track.
CLEW TO THE IDENTITY.
The best clew to the movement of the
four thugs just before their encounter
with Lestresire and their whereabouts
on the morning after the killing of one
<jf the gang is supplied by G. Y. Mo
rag-a, formerly a deputy sheriff of Con
tra Costa County. Moraga saw the dead
man on February 16 in Los Ang-eles.
Last Wednesday night Moraga saw the
dead man come into the Bell Theater
in Oakland, vlth three companions.
They sat well down in front and
watched all who came in with care.
After the performance, Moraga saw
them standing on a corner opposite thÂ«
theater and heard them discuss a
proposed trip to Richmond via San
Pablo avenue. Four hours afterward
this gang met Officer Lestrange at West
Berkeley, and the man who was recog
nized by Moraga as having been seen

TRIES BRIBERY
ON APPRAISER
A brazen attempt to , bribe a customs
official was reported to . Collector . Strat
ton yesterday, morning -\u0084, by Appraiser
John T. Dare. . On the preceding evening
after he had arrived at his . residence,
2422 Clay street, he was handed a' letter,
which had come through the malls. , The
letter contained two United States bills
of tho denomination. of $50 each, and its
tenor was to bribe him so that he might
appraise certain merchandise -at a 'sum
higher man Its value. The letter and
the address on \u25a0 the envelope .'.were' writ
ten in led j pencil, 'the words being
"printed" with -the- pencil rather than
written. The following- is a copy: \u25a0'\u25a0.
Hon. J. T. Dare-^-Dear.Sir: I beg to inform
you the New I Chinese Bazaar, corner Dupont
and California, streets, name Sing Chong Co.,
he had a large lot of 'curios at the uncleam
warehouse, will commence pay duty very soon.
I understood this goods price very low. Trust
ing to suggestion to your Examener'to careful
to examine his goods, give a fair, chance 'who
had his goods in right price and oblige. Please
find enclosed, if come out satisfactory, 'may
hear from me again. -. j â¢
Also the Canton Bazaar or Wah "Chong Lung
& Co.. Goods price very - low" too. " Very re
spectfully. . . J. BROWN.
After Mr. Dare had perused this diplo-i
matic note, and seen that the" bills were
genuine and that it was not a Joke, he
muttered an incantation In the Hawaiian
language, and followed with something
in terse Anglo-Saxon that waa-not an In
cantation. He lost no time in laying the
letter, and the bills before Special Treas
ury Agent Caleb W. West; and Collector
Stratton. There was absolutely no clew
to ciie Identity of the writer. Mr. Strat
ton turned the bribe money over to the
United States Sub-treasury, |to await its
disposition by the Secretary of the Treas
ury. Although it is "tainted"" money
theie Is no other custodian - for . it. Spe
cial Agent West.- will. return the money
to the writer of the letter If he will ap
pear In person and receipt -for, it.

TRIO VANISH
NEAR STEGE
TAIT'S WAITERS
QUIT IN BODY
Tait's .big cafe -presented an aspect of
gloom shortly after' B o'clock last night,
when â¢ the full corps of waiters, number
ing eighty in all, : quit .their posts of
duty in a body and walked out of the
place. So sudden was the upheaval that
Manager Halton was' unable to get hands
to take the places -of y the, men, who quit
and the cafe : was .closed for . the â¢ night.
The walkout originated over the dismis
sal of Frank Rovy, the head waiter of
the. establishment.- : Royy's work ap
parently did not meet with the approval
of Manager Hal ton -and -the latter dis
charged him -about ' 8 -o'clock, when the
dinner ' rush? was over. y
Rovy apparently knew: what .was com
ing, for he immediately^ informed his fel
low workmen what had happened and
they all decided; to quit wftlr him. Rovy
was popular; with: the -other; waiters and
when they learned that he was. about to
leave them "they said they would forsake
Tait's In a body!; : ; ;
Manager Halton- made a vain- endeaovr
to persuade the : waiters . to remain, but
they flatly refused. Many, of them said
later that; they, had, been badly i treated
by the management and had ' practically
all decided to ; quit before Rovy's ! dis
missal: ' :".'v";"^." ' "';/;"/'\u25a0 r'VA:: , ''.'~i?-\j'.
Some of the waiters declared they had
not been _ .well" fed jj and that complaints
to the management availed nothing. They
declared that \Halton / came to them I when
they we're* about -"to; leave: and promised
better food and treatment if -they > would
remain.- But it? was too later then, for

WIFE OF MERCHANT
Is Securely Hidden Away for

and Only Allowed Fresh
Air on Roof at Night
! Pretty, little Gong Ho, a girl only
14 years old, was rescued on
Wednesday from a Chinese brothel and
is now being cared for by the Presby
terian -Mission at 920 -Sacramento
street. '
The saving of the young girl from
a life of slavery and shame is due to
the combined efforts of Miss Cameron,
the superintendent .of the mission,
coupled with the assistance of Gong
Yon, a Chinese girl living at the mis
sion, and Police Officers Arey and
Holmes. The girl . was only found
after a vigilant hunt, .under: a bunk
covered .with rice mats, where she had
been hidden away by her owners. ,
She seemed delighted when she was
taken away from her 5 hiding place,
where she had been concealed from
view for four hours.
HEARS OF THE CASE.
The news came to Miss Cameron
early 4 Wednesday morning 1 that ' a
girl' only 14 years old had been
brought over here about two months
ago on the steamer China and was
landed from that vessel as the alleged
wife of an American-born Chinaman
named | Chun Ah Lum, who claimed to
be . a , merchant here. The girl had " no
sooner been landed than Chun Ah Lum
disappeared from view and she was
turned over to Ah Sue. who is one of
the most notorious women of her class
in the Chinese district here. Since the
girl arrived here Ah Sue has kept her
carefully hidden away. She has never
been allowed to go out on the street,
and the only breath of fresh air or
air of any kind that did not get from
the polluted cage she was kept in-was
at night, when she was allowed to go

up on the roof of her prison and walk
about in the darkness.
â- Miss Cameron started out at noon
on Wednesday, and with Gong Yon
and Officers Arey and Holmes, began
to search the/place at 1116 Stockton
street. The quartet climbed up and
down the rickety stairs, stumbled
through the dark and narrow hall
ways and delved into every room that
came within their .view. Gong Yon.
the Chinese girl who accompanied the
searchers, was rescued from a life of
shame at this very house some three
years -ago. She ' was of most valuable
assistance in this search. She went up
narrow passages and seemingly Im
possible .ladders, until she finally
perched herself upon i the topmost point
of the roof. She insisted that the girl
was hidden away there somewhere.
? OFFICERS MAKE SEARCH.
The officers looked down the chim
neys and under the rickety balconies
that hang to the back part of the
buildings of that locality. There were
no signs of the girl they -were looking
for. After over three hours of hard
work-they were about to give up the
search .and were climbing down a
dirty, ; greasy . ladder, .when Officer, Arey
discovered a small-sized door, appar
ently leading into a closet. The party
stopped suddenly. and Arey broke open
the door. He climbed, in through the
aperture and there- in a little dark,
stuffy room, bidden, away under a
bunk and . lying flat on the floor, con
cealed from view by a pile .of rice
mats, was found the object of the
search. She was dragged out from her
place " of concealment, scared, fright
ened andy covered with dirt and dust
from head to foot. Water. was brought
and, her. face and .hands were washed.
Then' it was discovered that she was
as handsome a! young girl as has ever
been brought to this coast. When the
object of the visit was made plain to
her -she was only too glad to go with
her.; new found friends. No resistance
was made by any of the Chinese; In the
building. -In fact, thÂ© residents there
made themselves conspicuous by their
absence. Miss Cameron learned yes
terday that thÂ« price paid for Gong Ho
in \u0084 China was . $3000 . gold.
