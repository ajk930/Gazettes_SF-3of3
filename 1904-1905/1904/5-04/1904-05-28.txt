GUNS OF THE RUSSIANS LOCATED, IN EMPLACEMENTS.
The Japanese discovered also a number of large emplacements, but they did not learn the
number of guns contained therein. These emplacements faced to the north and to the e"ast. The
guns fired by the Russians developed a range of 8500 meters. Eight heavy guns posted .on the
Russian right in the vicinity oÂ£ Hushangtao also were discovered, and another strong Russian posi
tion developed by these reconnoissances was on another hill southwest of Nanshan Hill, where
the Russians had aperies of shelter trenches.
On the shore of Talienwan Bay, close to the head of the bay, the Russians had established
a series of, positions. _ Here were set up the searchlights which nightly played over the Japanese
angle '[in I the hills to, the northeast. Further, reconnoissances developed the fact that west of Liu

The robbers chose a rainy night and,
their tracks were : covered up before
morning; but they could hardly go far
with the ore, as the. country 1 is very
rough >â¢Â»-
TUCSON. Ariz., May 27.â Twenty
thousand dollars' "worth of gold ore,
sorted and sacked, was stolen from the
Esmeralda mine In Sonora a few nights
ago, and the Mexican rurales are now
scouring the country round about in
an effort to discover where the treas
ure is concealed. J. R. Henderson, su
perintendent of the mine, believes that
the robbers were former employes, as
the ore, stolen was taken from some
rich pockets in the mine and was piled
In sixty sacks alongside the lower
grade ores. Â« % The robbers knew how to
discriminate, for every sack of the rich
ore was taken and none of the lower
grades was touched. The ore was piled
up not a hundred yards from the
bunkhouse, and how the robbers cart
ed It away without disturbing the su
perintendent or his^men and where
they concealed It Is a mystery.
The Mexican authorities believe that
the robbers have concealed the ore in
some old workings In Ihe mountains
near by awaiting- a favorable oppor
tunity to dispose. of it. As a result
and because of a handsome reward of
fered by the owners of the mine,
searching parties are examining every
old shaft and prospect hole for miles
around, but no trace of the treasure
has been discovered.

ST. LOUIS. May 27.â Miss Alice
Roosevelt's passport to tne world's fair
was unavailing this afternoon, because
she came to the exposition in a phaeton
instead of an aatomobile as the gate
keeper had expected. The admissions
department issued orders to the gate
inspector to accept the announcement
of the driver, "Miss Roosevelt in auto
mobile," as carte blancne for herself
and party.
She came in a phaeton and the as
tute man on guard refused to admit
her party free because his instructions
were for an automobile. George D.
Markham, Miss Roosevelt's escort, 're
lieved the situation by buying tickets.
Miss Roosevelt smiled merrily at the
situation as Markham paid and they
drove inside to await the arrival of the
balance of the party In three automo
biles. Because "Miss Roosevelt in a
phaeton" was outside of his official
Jurisdiction, the gateman compelled the
remainder of the party to pay? and
Markham did the honors for them
again as in the case or Miss Roose

LATEST GREAT FIGHT OCCURRED.
. The Japanese first occupied the line of hills to the east of Kinchou. Their position here form
ed an almost perfect right angle, showing its southern front to Talienwan and its western front to
Kinchou. Chiulichan village was the apex of this angle. The extreme Japanese right rested at
Chenchatien, which is almost due north of Chiulichan, while the extreme left was at Chaitzuho, a
village due east of Chiulichan. Back of this angle the attacking force assembled in complete se
curity, r '
The Russians apparently attempted to draw the Japanese attack last Saturday, for their bat
teries opened fire slowly on the enemy that day. The Japanese, however, refused to be drawn
until the positions of the Russians, their guns and their strength had been fully,, developed. To this
end the Japanese began a series of careful reconnoissances, their officers working their way close
enough to the Russian position to draw the enemy's fire. They thus secured fragments of shells
for the purpose of ascertaining the caliber of the Russian guns. They discovered that the batteries
on Nanshan Hill included four howitzers of about fifteen centimeters caliber, ten old-style cannon of
between nine and fifteen centimeters caliber and two quick-firingguns of twelve centimeters.
TOKIO, May 27. â The Japanese army swept the Russians from Kinchou yesterday morn
ing and in a desperate attack stormed the almost impregnable position of the Russians on Nanshan
Hill, west of Talienwan. j
. The battle raged in the hills all through the night, and fragmentary telegrams from the Jap
anese headquarters report that the engagement is still in progress and that the Japanese are pursu
ing the Russians south from Nanshan and the head of Talienwan Bay.
The Russians had made elaborate preparations to check the Japanese movement south on the
Liaotung Peninsula toward Port Arthur. They had fortified the high ground on the south shore
of Talienwan Bay, their works extending to the east and the .west. The extreme Russian right
was at Hushangtao and the extreme left at Nanshan Hill. This hill was the strongest part of the
line. A series of batteries, strongly emplaced, crowned its crest, while rifle pits extended around
its sides. Mines had beeni placed lower down on this hill, and around the base on the northern and
eastern sides were stretched well-made wire entanglements. Another line of defenses, also protect
ed with wire entanglements, extended from Yenchiatun, near the head of Talienwan Bay, due north
of Chiulichan. A strong Russian force was posted at Kinchou. It consisted of infantry and ar
tillery. 5 * _.' - -

LONDON, May 27. â A dispatcU to the Central News from Harbin says the Jap
anese losses during the fighting at Kinchou are said to be 12,000 men killed. It is
said that these figures have been confirmed by an official dispatch. Fighting, it is
added, is still going on in the vicinity of Kinchou.
NEW YORK. May 27. â Three keep
ers in Central Park vrere cajled on to
day to save the lives of eleven great
.African pythons by dosing them with
medicine to check the ravages of a
parasite which has already kilted two
of them.
Car.fBllv the three men opened the
d-jcr of the cage, where several of the
reptiles lay coiled on the floor, while
'others hung from branches of trees,
. tiieir heads swaying from side to side,
their beadlike eyes turned suspiciously
o!Â» the intruders.
Â¦Quick, boys, this is no picnic," said I
Shannon, the head keeper, seizing one
f>{ the snakes Just back of its head.
. Bnyder had a syringre in which was a
quantity of medicine ready and as
.Shannon pried open "the snake's mouth
bnyder squirted a dose down the rep
tile's throat.
"Here'a another," cried Cook, but
a? he reached out his hand the snake

slipped oh its slimy skin. Quick as
lightning the snake shot its head back,

nf the lot, measures twelve feet from

.seized his neck. Cook tried to seize
his squirming taH, but with his hands

reptile had curled himself about one
of Shannon's legs and the keeper fell
in the floor. Snyder and Cook rushed

Â£r*c:al DltrÂ»tch to The CaU.
M. Ribot, minority leader, was among
those voting in support of the Govern
ment.
The debate attracted unusual atten
tion, and great crowds were present,
including Embassador Porter and other
members of the diplomatic corps.
The principal speeches were those of
Premier Combes and M. Delcasse.
"The recair of M. Nisard," said Pre
mier Combes, "means that we will not
allow the Papacy to intermeddle in our
international relations, and that we in
tend to have done, once for all with tho
superannuated fiction of temporal
power, which disappeared thirty-fou*
years ago. We will not withdraw thÂ«
whole staff accre<3Utd tc the Vatican,
as Tve are bound by the concordat :o
maintain at the Vatican an agent of
our' Government for the carrying on
of business. We cannot suppress tha
embassy and concordat by 'our own au
thority, for that right belongs to the
Chambers."
Premier Combes -went on to say that
several-schemes for ending the con
cordat were under consideration in
committee, and it only remained for
the Chamber to have the question
brought up for consideration-immedi
ately after the passage of the budget
next January.
"Seeing how the concordat is daily
observed, or rather violated, by the
church," continued the Premier,
"some solution is necessary. We can
no longer remain in this situation
without bringing it to an issue. When
the discussion comes up I will state
the Government's opinion,, but for the
moment I ask the Chamber to confine
Its solution to the measure forcing the
subject of this debate."
REVIEWS THE CONTROVERSY.
Foreign Minister Delcasse in his
speech retraced the history of the â¢
question from the spring of 1903. when
the papal nuncio asked questions con
cerning the eventuality of President
Loubet's visiting Rome, to which II.
Delcasse replied that he could not fur
jiish the information.
Coming to the immediate cause of
the. rupture, he said that a Parisian
paper published the text of the papal
note as addressed to the other
powers, which was couched in terms
of remonstrance which the, French
Government could not accept. The
Government's duty was clear, as the
authenticity of the document had been
proved. Three courses were open: To
Premier Combes took the initiative ia
resisting all efforts to force the Govern
jnent to extreme action, and his request
that all questions regarding the separa
tion of church and state go over until
next January has the effect of post
poning separation beyond the present
session of Parliament.
A resolution proposed by M. Ferrette,
Republican - Nationalist, inviting the
Government to negotiate with Pope
Pius for a separation of the church and
state, was defeated, 507 to 18. A mo
tion by M. Allard. Socialist, to break
off at once all relations with the Vati
can and to denounce immediately the
concordat, was defeated, 3S5 to 113.
PARIS, May 27.â After an exciting
debate in which Premier Combes and
Foreign Minister Delcasse set forth
the action and purposes of the* Govern
ment toward the Vatican, the Chamber
of Deputies to-day, by a vote of 427 to
95, approved the course of the Govern
ment in recalling M. Nisard, Embassa
dor to the Vatican, and rejectel all pro
posals of the extreme element for an
immediate dissolution of the relations
between church and state.

The departure of H. C. Raap, Contra
Costa"s Tax Collector and World's Fair
commissioner. has caused regret
among his fellow Californfans here.
Raap never let a visitor depart without
a good impression of California and the
men she produces. His "hot air" is ol
a variety that grasps the tourist before
he is aware and leaves him enthralled
long after he gets away from the
source. If Raap had not gone home in
time to garner the tithes he could not
have paid himself his salary, and he
will need it after a sojourn at the fair.

Mr. Hay, of course, couldn't place
Mr. Brown, but Mr. Brown didn't ex
pect he would, and continued:
"I lived just four doors from you on
Euclid avenue, in Cleveland, and used
to think your 'Banty Tim' was the
greatest poem ever written."
"Now I remember," said Secretary
Hay. "You are the nephew of William
Bingham, -who died just two weeks ago.
He was a good man."
Bingham was one of the wealthiest
iron manufacturers of Ohio and Brown
lived with him as a boy. His niece
married William C. Whitney.
The Secretary of State and the coun
ty commisioner had a long chat and
the diplomat, after viewing Brown's ex

some sampling of products, said San

the distinction of being carefully in

LOS ANGELES, May 27. â Officers
of the California National Guard are
endeavoring to make arrangements
for the biggest encampment ever held
in this State, and although the plans
have not received the final approval
of the War Department there is re'a
son to believe that they will succeed.
The proposition is to have the several
brigades of the National Guard and as
many regular troops as can be sent
from the various posts in this State,
together with the allied organization,
such as the naval reserve, mobilized
for Instruction in a camp large enough
to make possible a mimic campaign.
The place at which it is proposed to
hold the camp is the tract In San Luis
Obispo and Monterey counties, which
has been suggested* for purchase by
the Government as a military reserve
to be used for Just such encampments.
The plan has the approval of the Gov
ernor and the adjutant general's de
partment, and through those agencies
efforts are being made to induce the
War Department to consent to the use
of troops of the regular establishment
for such a camp.

Delegate Abdol had been told of Lou
isiana and Texas and expected to go
down to one of those States to secure
land tor a tentative colony, but the
Egyptian section in the Palace of Agri
culture is very dose to that of Califor
nia, and the bouquet of a certain brand
of cisars k^pt there attracted Colonel
Green and Judsre Wills of the Sacra
mento Development Association sec
tion. When they learned what Abdel
wanted Louisiana and Texas were left
at the poet. The delegate had already
been told that the climate of California
was much like that of Egypt, and a
glance at her products did the rest. The
knowledge possessed by Green and
Wills of the language of the Ptolemies
didr.t help out any, but fortunately
Abdel hed learned the English lan
guage well, having been told at home
of the beauty of the American girl â
that it even transcended the cigarette
photos Vf his own Cleopatra â and pre
pared himself to converse.
The Egyptian will go to California
with G. H. Hecke of Woodland, who
Koes back soon. Experiments will be
tf.ade by the people brought out by him
in the growing of rice, cotton, sugar,
various kinds of cereals and other Nile
products, after the manner of the Egyp
tians. Many Egyptians, who will work
in the orchards during the fruit season,
if they locate in California, may join
the colony later.

It is increasingly difficult to find en

Although packer hides are active and
firm, tanners discriminate in favor of
late saltings, which is causing some
accumulation of the less desirable qual

Failures this week numbered 226 in
the United States, against 206 last
year, and 17 In Canada, compared with

NEW YORK. May 27.â R. G. Dun &
Co.'s weekly review of trade to-morrow
will say:
Retail trade .is stimulated by season
able weather and the industrial trade
is brighter on the whole, although ad
verse factors have appeare". The big
dry goods auction sale opened with an
unexpectedly large attendance and
good prices were secured. It is par
ticularly gratifying to note that retail
ers rather than jobbers have made
most of the purchases, thus providing
prompt distribution ijito consuming
channels throughout the country- Man
ufacturing lines report a slight; im
provement at, woolen mills and shoe
factories, and while there is more idle
cotton machinery it is worthy of note
that the last Fall River statement
showed very little reduction in prices.
Railroad earnings so far reported for
May fall 3.3 per cent short of the same
time last year, but foreign commerce
at this oort for the last week shows
gains of $1,637,200 in exports and $649,
549 in imports.
In Canada failures were 14, against
11 last week, and 23 in this week a year
ago.
Wheat (including flour) exports for
the week ending May 26 aggregate 1,
: 132,157 bushels, against 1,225,763 last
' week; 4,677,678 this week last year.
.From July 1, 1903, to date they aggre
1 gate 125.992,511 bushels, against 204.164,
! S12 bushels last season.
NEW YORK, May 27.â Bradstreefa
to-morrow" will say:
The situation is father more irregu
lar. Distributive trade, stimulated by
better weather in some sections, has
improved, but is still behind a year
ago. Cereal crops, particularly winter
wheat, show improvement, but cotton
reflects drought, especially in the South
Atlantic States, while good reports
come from West of the Mississippi.
The industrial condition is hardly so
satisfactory, a tic-wing down % belng
noted in many leading industries; the
number of idle persons is growing and
unskilled labor shows in some sections
a lack of foresight and knowledge of
real conditions. Current railroad earn
ings continue to show declines from a
year ago.
The copper market has moved lower
this week, as has also lead.
Wool is dull and in hand-to-mouth
demand at Boston, New York and
Philadelphia, but is selling actively at
prices equal to or above a year ago
at the We3t, with one-half of the
spring wool clip reported sold.
Business failures in the United States

corresponding week of 1903.
CHICAGO. May 27.â Choking and
gasping and with eyes rolling with ter
ror, John A. Mahnken, accused . of
fraudulently identifying the body of
Mrs. Frank R. Greemvald, an Iroquois
Theater fire victim, in order to steal
her money, suddenly jumped to his 1 feet
in Judge Clifford's courtroom to-day
and pointed frantically at an imaginery
specter which he thought stood con
fronting him.
While the spectators looked in terror
the man frothed at the lips and waved
his arms wllflly in the air. He was
overpowered and thrown to the floor,
where it took half a dozen policemen
to hold him. Paroxysm after paroxysm
shook him, and he had to be manacled
and taken into an anteroom.
When quiet was restored Mahnken's
lawyer decided to let the case go to the
jury v.ithout argument. Almost imme
diately the twelve men filed back and
the foreman announced a verdict ,of
guilty. The technical charge against
Mahnken was perjury, and it was
proved that he had taken the body of
Mrs. Greenwald from a morgue and
had it buried as his aunt. His motive
was to gain possession of the $400 found
on the body.
CLAREMONT, May 27.â Harry Wil

Willett, who has been sleeping in the
house while Mrs. Renwick's family is

this morning by some person trying to
force open a screen door at the rear of
the house. Upon going to investigate
Willett saw a man In the act of cutting
the wire screen and thrusting through
the holr a bundle of oil soaked rags.
Willett watched the firebug for a time,
and when he saw him strike a match
to apoly to the rags he fired a shot at
the imruder. The man dropped the
match and springing back fired two
shots at Willett, both of which took ef
fect.. One bullet struck Willett in the
left' shoulder and entered the pleural
cavity. The other bullet passed through
the biceps of his left arm, breaking the
bone. The shooting attracted the atten
tion of officers and Willetfs cries
aroused the neighborhood. A search
was made for the firebug, but no trace
of him could be found.

Arsenic has been found in a barrel in

into custody one night by a party of
rangers, tied in a wagon and taken
overland to Florence, a distance of
100 miles. All of them were indicted
on severakcounts and Tom Armstrong,
the leader, was the first one brought
to trial. Acquitted on the first charge
by the evidence of men of unenviable
reputation, Armstrong and his ,inen
thought they were to be freed as be
fore, when the jury which tried him
on the second charge brought in a
verdict of guilty. The Livestock Sani

they mean to send every member of
the gang to the penitentiary.

NEW YORK, May 27.â A sensation
was created in Cotton Exchange circles
to-day when the suspended firm of D.

the receivers now in charge of the
firm's business that they buy 190,000
bales of spot cotton for the firm's ac
count. D. J. Sully & Co. claim that
they were not notified by any of the
brokers that their cotton had been sold
out, and they therefore wish the re
ceivers to buy in 190,000 bales of actual
cotton. The present stock of spot cot
ton in New York does not exceed 70.000
bales, but on March 18, when D. J. Sul

of 190,000 bales. May contracts.

There was a wordy war over the
school fund, and when the board meets
to-day it will be renewed, for Presi

for the amount to which he claims
the schools are entitled. The budget
does not allow as much by $108,000 as
he contends should be allowed.
There was quite a little passage at
arms between Supervisor Branden
steln and John W. Rogers, president of
the Civil Service Commission over the
matter of the appropriation for that
branch of the city government. Rogers
stated that the commission was re
sponsible to the people and he certaln-
This morning at 10:30 o'clock the
Board of Supervisors will pass to print
the budget for the fiscal year, and, ac
cording to the figures agreed upon,
there will be appropriations to the
amount of $7,3S4,836, and that will
necessitate the levying of a tax of
$1.2053. Every item was gone over last
night at the meeting of the board and
protests and requests listened to. From
the tone of the members of the board
at the conclusion of the meeting there
is little likelihood of any change being
made in the figures presented by the
Finance Committee except in the
amount apportioned to the Police De
partment and possibly the school fund.
As the matter stands now, and which
the board was not able to ratify last
night owing to the lateness of the
hour, the amounts apportioned will be
as follows:

LOS ANGELES, May 27.â Thomas S.
Ingraham, first grand chief engineer of
the International Brotherhood of Loco

apoplexy. Ingraham, who was 69 years
of age, had been assistant and first

SEOUL, May 27. â The Gensan corre
spondent of a Seoul paper wires that a
body of 600 Russians with seven guns,
preceded by fifteen scouts, passed
Songchin and advanced to Tanchyon
yesterday. It Is further stated that
some hundreds of Cossacks with six
guns are at Kapsan. The correspondent
declares that the panic among the in
habitants is increasing and that the
country people are fleeing south and
west.
Koreans in the Kinchayon district,
south of Songjin, have destroyed the
local telegraph office and several miles
of wire. They had petitioned previously
that the line be removed, claiming that
its presence constituted the only rea
scn for the repeated Russian expedi
tions Into the district. No official ac
tion was taken, and finally the Koreans
resolved to destroy the line themselves.
Edwin V. Morgan, the recently ap
pointed United States Consul at Port
Dalny, has arrived here. He came in
by way of Fusan, traveling overland.
* i-
The Japanese legation has received
the following details of the attack on
Kinchou:
"The enemy built several covered
trenches around the fort and Nan Hill
and held the place stubbornly under
strong defensive works. Nevertheless,
after several attempts, the Japanese
finally succeeded in taking: the enemy's
position 1 by storm and in driving them
toward Nankuling. This severe fight
ing continued for sixteen hours. Ad
miral Togo telegraphs that a report
was sent to him by wireless telegraph
from the captain commanding the de
tached squadron, consisting of four
gunboats and a torpedo flotilla, to the
effect that the squadron reached Kin
chou Bay, and, co-operating with the
army, bombarded Nan Hill on May
26 and on witnessing our army oc
cupying the forts on the hill the
squadron withdrew from the scene of
action. The captain of the gunboat
Chokai was killed and nine others
were killed and wounded. The dam
age to the vessels was insignificant."
WASHINGTON. May 27. â Minister
Griscom cables the State Department
from Tokto that the Japanese have
captured Kinchou and are marching
southward. Â¦
"I suppose," he adds, "that the lull
is due to preparations for a great bat
tel In the direction of Liaoyang."
The Mail's Sinmintun correspondent,
telegraphing under date of May 25,
declares there are only 2000 troops at
Mukden.
LONDON. May 23.â The Tokio dis
patch to the Associated Press and
Japanese officials' accounts are the
only detailed descriptions that have
yet reached London of the Japanese
victory at Kinchou. The victory is
hailed by the London press as estab
lishing, more certainly than did ths
operations on the Talu, the superior
ity of the Japanese on land as well as
by sea, since ln the case of Kinchou,
if not at the Yalu, the Russians had
ample time carefully to prepare their
positions. It appears that the con
clusive victory was immediately fol
lowed up, for the Post's Tokio corre
spondent asserts that the Japanese
have swept the Russians from their
defenses west of Talienwan. And if
the Telegraph's generally well-In
formed correspondent is correct, and
the Japanese are already nearing Port
Arthur, the Russians must have suf
fered a complete rout at Kinchou.
That the Russians were not only de
feated, but routed, would also appear
from the numerous captures of the
Russian artillery.
According to the Mall's correspond
ent, the Japanese Fifth division of
veterans, which is destined for the
storming of Port Arthur, has already
landed on the Liaotung peninsula.
The' Telegraph's correspondent at
Japanese headquarters, communicating
under date of May 26, says there is no

army, but that there are frequent
outpost encounters.

ST. PETERSBURG. May 27. â Tha
news of the Japanese victory at Kin

While there was little information
ln Government circles ressxdlns the
Russian defeat, the news caused the

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, MAY, 28, 1904.
TOKIO, May 27 (5 p. m. ). â Subsequent reports received here indicate that the storming of
Nanshan Hill yesterday was a bloody affair. The Japanese first centered their fire on the Russian
batteries, in which work they were aided by four gunboats from Kinchou Bay. They succeeded in
silencing many of the enemy's guns. The Russians had constructed a series of trenches around the
hill on a terrace protected by wire entanglements and other such devices. The Japanese made ' a
series of rushes, but they were in vain. The deadly rifle and cannon fire of the enemy checked
them repeatedly.
Finally, at 3 o'clock in the afternoon, the Japanese reformed and stormed the crest of the
hill. The Russians held to their position doggedly, and it was 7 o'clock in the evening before the
Japanese finally gnined possession of the ridge.
A Japanese officer of high rank made the following statement to-night:
"The Japanese, in attacking Kinchou and Nanshan Hill, had to fight against great odds.
The Russians were in full command of the strategical advantage? afforded by nature, and these
advantages were augmented by the newest inventions for defense. The forts on Nanshan Hill
were armed with heavy guns. The Japanese had only field guns, heavy guns being unavailable
on account, of the difficulties Â©^transportation. Our army deserves great credit for having
driven the Russians from this stronghold; it was a feat previously considered to have been impos
sible. I fear*our losses have been heavy, but we have gained the strongest point barring our way
to the investment of Port Arthur."
TOKIO, May 28 (12 m.). â The Russians have abandoned Nantuanling and have been
driven from Sanchilipu. retreating toward Port Arthur. The Japanese have captured fifty cannon.
The Russians left 400 dead in the Kinchou-Nanshan fight. On the Japanese side* the killed and
wounded number 300. , â¢
The battle was resumed at dawn of Thursday. Three Japanese gunboats then entered Kin
chou Bay, and, in co-operation with the artillery on shore, shelled the Russian positions on Nanshan
Hill. A Russian gunboat in Talienwan Bay steamed close to the shore and shelled the Japanese left.
From dawn the batteries on both sides hammered away at each other. At an early hour the Japan
ese infantry moved forward, and at twenty minutes past 5 o'clock on Thursday morning they en
tered Kinchou, the Russians retiring to the south.
The fighting continued into Thursday night, the Japanese pressing to the south and storm
ing Nanshan Hill. They followed the retreating Russians through the southern hills.
The reports received here fail to cover the events on the Russian right. It is probable,
however, that the Russians have abandoned these positions. The Russian resistance at Nanshan
Hill was stubborn. The Japanese made a series of assaults before the Russians finally yielded
the position. The Russians abandoned this hill at 3 o'clock in the_ afternoon, retreating toward
Nanquanling, where it is understood a second line of defenses exist. The Russians may rally at
this line of defenses unless they have been disordered by the defeat at Kinchou and Nanshan.
The Russians had a series of mines planted at Tafangshen station, on the railroad, which
were exploded. The station was destroyed. The Japanese forces were under fire for sixteen hours.
The general staff here has received telegrams from the commanders commending the bravery and
fortitude of their men.
RUSSIANS FIGHT BEHIND INTRENCHMENTS ON A TERRACE.
Wednesday morning at 5:30 o'clock the Japanese attacked Kinchou, and for three hours
they had an artillery duel with the batteries on Nanshan Hill. The Russian gunners searched the
Japanese lines with their fire, but failed to inflict much damage. . s
DESPERATE CONFLICT BETWEEN ARMIES AT DAWN.
coast of the Liaotung- Peninsula there were no defenses whatever, except the force posted at
Kinchou.
This gap in the defenses was a fatal defect in the Russian position, and when it was perceived
the Japanese extended their right to the north and enveloping Kinchou and the Russian ex
treme right. The Japanese left also was extended to Wangchiatung, on the shore of Talienwan
Bay, and the center moved forward.

Tells How Reclamation Work Achieved
Favorable Results Through Ab
sence of Political Interference^,
The members of the Technical So
ciety of the Pacific Coast met yester
day morning. They first paid a visit
to the Union Iron Works, after which
they assembled at the Academy of
Sciences Hall, where papers were read
by John Richards on "Steam Turbine
Motors," Professor F. G. Hesse on
"Jet Pumps â New and Original Theo
retical Developments," and by Mars
den Manson on "The Reclamation of
a Mountain Swamp in Southeastern
Oregon."
- In the course of his remarks Mr.
Manson said:
The reclamation Is more than half done over
a total area of fifty square miles. The actual
dredffln* wÂ»Â» begun the latter part of lÂ£02
and has advanced constantly since with the
exception of periods when the Ice was too thick
for oDÂ«ratlnÂ«c the dredge.
The cost of the excavating: had been 3 cents
a cubic yard for actual work and expense*,
charging: up half the cost of the plant
agn!n?t the entire work, the cost has been
4 12-1CO cents a cubic yard.
These favorable results were largely due to
the fact that there were no boards of trus
tees and self-constituted critics and advisors
to Interfere In any irtage of the work, and tha
political results In no way affected tht conduct
of the work.
If the far grander problems In Uw Sacra
mento and San Joaquln rivers and eWewhere
could be attacked under the same conditions
equally good results could be obtained.
In- the evening Franklin Riffle read
a paper on "Pipes and Joints for High
Pressure"; H. I. Randall read -a pa
per on "Vertical Railway Curves": M.
C. Couchot spoke on "Armored Con
crete Construction,' 'and J. J. Welsh
read a paper on "Experiments in Driv
ing Piles for a Foundation With a

His Grace Archbishop Montgomery
made the announcement of the Judges'
decision and presented the handsome
trophy to the winning company. The
funds realized from the sale of tick
ets will be used to defray the expense
of fitting up the gymnasium and quar
ters of the organization on Market

In the individual competitive drill
Sergeant Milo Kent of v Company A
carried off the honors.
After one of the most interesting
competitive drills ever held by the
First Regiment, League of the Cross

trophy was awarded to Company D at
the Mechanics' Pavilion last night.
Fully 50000 people witnessed the con
test. The victorious company was un
der command of Captain James E.
McCormick and Lieutenants L. Boland
and J. F. Foley.
The other competing companies. L,
B, N and A. were ably handled by
their respective officers and it required
considerable deliberation and figuring
by the Judges to arrive at a verdict.
Lieutenant Colonel Bolton . of the
Tenth Infantry. U. S. A.; Captain Phil

Lieutenant Hughes of the coast ar
tillery officiated as Judges, and Col
onel Charles Morris, U. S. A., of the

They all united In praising the work
of the youthful soldiers. S*.
The LÂ«ague of the Cross Cadets
band was one of the most pleasing fea
tures of the eveninjr and under the
able leadership of Lieutenant Ernest
G. Williams rendered a number of se
lections in a manner that called forth
much applause. Company H, under
command of Captain F. Daly, covered
itself with glory by constructing: a
forty-foot" bridge in six minutes and
a half and taking down the structure
in less than five minutes. A aham bat
tle participated in by four companies
was most realistic and the mimic war
fare was thoroughly enjoyed by the
spectators. â

No one was better qualified to orga
nize the Manila department than Chief
Bonner. He has spent all his life fight
irtg fires and was with the New York
Fire Department from 1865 to late In
1899. The last big fire Chief Bonner
fought in New; York was the fatal
Windsor Hotel fire, on Mrch 17, 1899, in
which eighteen persons lost their lives.
Before I arrived at Manila arui took chars*
the Filipino method of fire fighting consisted
of letting UÂ»* fire eat itself out. Therefore
when our department got to working: with
American methods the natives were astonished.
The first American firemen were the regulars,
under the provost marshals. We have now
at Manila all the latest Improvements In the
flre fighting line In general use In the United
States. One-half the force are native Filipinos
and the remainder, including: the officers, en
gineers and drivers, are Americans.
Among those that arrived on the Si
beria yesterday morning was Hugh
Bonner, chief of the Manila Fire De
partment and former chief of the New
York Fire Department. Chief Bonner
is returning for a well-earned rest and
intends to Inspect the departments of
all the large American cities, commenc
ing with San Francisco., in order to
note the latest improvements.
Speaking of the Manila department
Chief Bonner said:
Manila's Fire Department.
"I made up my mind years ago,"
said Muir yesterday, "that there was
no land fairer than North America. 1
determined to make Its acquaintance.
I studied* it for thirty-five years, and
when I left here a year ago it was not
that I had exhausted North America,
or that I was tired of it. I wanted to
test a few of the theories evolved dur
ing a long term of intimate study.
"When I got to Shangha.1, however,
and found myself alone, the wander
lust was in my bones. I took a globe
and had a long gloat over the names
of places I had often dreamed of vis
iting. Then I commenced to travel."
Where other travelers find good, bad
or indifferent hotels, Muir found
mountains and trees which he greeted
in every land he visited as old friends.
He found the heat of India oppressive,
but in the Himalaya Mountains real
ized a long-cherished dream. The
action of ice, he says, Is the same all
over the world, and in the Himalaya
glaciers he found more old friends.
His principal quest In India was the
deodar tree. After much traveling he
found what he describes as a "grand
grove" at Agra, but was greatly dis
gusted at learning that the owner of
a house situated within full view of
the trees knew neither their name nor
their fame. V-*'-'
"The cedars of Lebanon" are of the
deodar family, and* in Egypt Muir met
some more tree friends. He was tnter 7
ested In Egypt at the excavations
â¢ which he says are being conducted
with scientific skill and on a stupen
dous scale. â¢
Cholera barred the traveler's way to
Cairo, so he journeyed to Ceylon for
a glimpse of the primeval forests of
that part of the world.
It was In New Zealand that he made
the most wonderful finds. The flora
of that land, he says, would make a
dead botanist rise In his * grave.- He
also visited the forests of Luzon,
which he found wonderfully rich. "It
was a grand journey, but I'm glad to
get home," he said after describing
the . wonders he had seen. President
Roosevelt learned of Muir's contem
plated travels when they were together
in the Yellowstone. The President
gave the botanist a . letter addressed
to army and navy officers introducing
Muir and stating that any favofs"ex
tended the botanist would" earn" the
personal appreciation of the President.
He left here in company with Pro
fessor Sargent and Sargent's son, In
tending to visit Siberia and study the
geological formation of the land. The
trip through Russia proved arduous.
Heavy tea drinking wearied the bot
anist's Stomach, and at Shanghai hu
said good-by to his companions and
started out on his own account.
John Muir, the famous botanist and
familiar friend of President Roosevelt,
arrived yesterday on the liner Siberia
and ended the journey he commenced
when he left here a year ago on the
Presidential train. Since he was last
in San Francisco the famous moun
tain climber has visited Russia, China,
Japan, India, Egypt, Australia and
New .Zealand. . . .
Among the. passengers that arrived
on the Siberia from Honolulu yester
day were Captain Glen Collins, for
merly of the Queen's Own Cameron
Regiment, and his bride of a few
weeks. They were i married in Mon
terey a month ago and departed on
the last, steamer for the Orient. A
week' ago in Honolulu, however, a
buggy in which Mrs. Collins was rid
ing overturned and she was thrown to
the ground and dragged for some dis
tance. /Although her injuries were
slight Captain Collins decided to aban
don their proposed trip to Japan and
prepared for Immediate return to this
city. Captaln'and Mrs. Collins are
registered at the St.' Francis and will
leave in a few days for London.'
Lieutenant Commander W. ,W. .Bu
chanan of the navy, who. arrived here
yesterday from the. Orient, has .been
appointed executive officer of the new
! battleship Ohio. "'"
. .. B. C. Colver of the , Scripps-McRea
syndicate of newspapers was also one
of the passengers on the Siberia. He
was with a number of other news
paper representatives when the Jap-
Captain Glen Collins and Bride Re
' turn From Honolulu on Siberia.
War matters in the Orient or national
or political subjects he declined to dis
cuss. He is accompanied by Lady
Treves and his daughter, Mrs. Delme-
Radcliffe. who Is the wife of Colonel
Charles Radcliffe of the British army.
During his sojourn In India he and his
family were the guests of honor of Lord
Curzon, Lord Kitchener and the Maha
rajah of India.
Distinguished attention was also
shown him in China and ~Japan. He
was received here by Dr. T. William
White, professor of surgery of the Uni
versity of Pennsylvania. Mrs. White
accompanied the professor. They will
all journey East together. Sir Frederick
will be the guest of Dr. White in Phila
delphia.
Both Lady Treves and her daughter
are charming women. Mrs. Radcliffe
Is a remarkable type of English beauty.
They both expressed themselves as de
lighted' with their tour and were loud
In their praises of San Francisco as
they saw it from the bay.
-Dr. Ellin wood of the Cooper Medical
College went to the Siberia to greet
Sir Frederick and invited him to visit
the college, which invitation Sir Fred
erick said he would be glad to accept.

In speaking of his tour he said
Among the most eminent of the pas
sengers on the Siberia was Sir Fred
erick Treves, Bart., K. C. V. O., and
K. C. B., who is making a tour of the
world.
Sir Frederick is one of the most dis
tinguished of England's surgeons. He
was brought into prominence by the
successful operation he performed \ipon
King Edward for an attack of appen
dicitis in June, 19<Â£, whereby the
King's life was saved.
j He has been sergeant surgeon to the
King since 1901. He was surgeon ex
traordinary to the late Queen during
1900-1901, and was knighted in 1001. His
publications have been numerous and
are highly valued in the medical world.
He is a man of commanding mein, of
distinguished appearance and of high
bred, affable manner.
Another passenger of note on the
Siberia was Major S. C. Radcliff of the
Thirty-third Burmah Regiment, who
is on a leave of absence and en route
to England. He i3 registered at the
Palace.
J. H. Lewis, a steamship owner of
Hongkong, came in on the Siberia and
is staying at the St. Francis. It was
one of hisj vessels, the Hainong. that
was chartered by the -London Times
as a dispatch-boat and afterward or
dered away from Port Arthur by the
Russian Government
anese Government bottled them up in
Tokio at the beginning of the war and,
becoming disgusted with the situation,
he made his retreat across the Pa
cific to this port. He is registered at
the St. Francis.
CARRIAGES AND FLAGS.
When the Slocum arrived ._ at the
Unfortunately, for the dignity and
perfect order of the reception a cus
toms officer permitted' some of the
strangers to come down the gangplank
to the deck of the tug and then order
ed them back again that they might
be thoroughly identified before landing
on American soil. /Owing to a strong
tide and the stiff breeze it was almost
two hours before the tug could be
brought safely alongside the massive
Siberia, but when the quests were
once aboard the Slocum the run to the
transport dock was. made with little
delay. During the run the committee
men assured the .visitors that the peo
ple of San Francisco, of California, and
of the nation were anxious to bid them
a hearty welcome to American shores.
The Filipinos are for the most part
men of mature years, and many of
them showed streaks of gray in their
closely cropped hair.
The Slocum left the dock at 9 o'clock
and hovered in the stream for more
than two hours: When, finally, a sig
nal showed that the doctors had fin
ished their Inspection of the ship, the
Slocum approached to bid the guests
a welcome. Long before the commit
teemen were within hailing distance
they were busy with Bea glasses, try-
Ing to descry their guests. Suddenly
a bright bit of ctrlor loomed above the
deck. It was Senora V. Matta, gowned
in a Parisian creation of crimson, a
belle of the Orient She smiled to those
aboard the tug and soon the committee
had discovered the country's guests.
SIGHTING THE GUESTS.
Major Devol, chief of the transport
service, tendered the committee the use
of the Slocum and wan a. splendid host
for the party. Governor Pardee and
Mayor Schmitz had been asked to be
present, but they failed to appear.
Those present were: George C. New
hall, who went as president of the
Chamber of Commerce; Frank J.
Symmee, president or tne Merchants'
Association; A. Sbarboro, president of
the Manufacturers' and Producers'
Association; N. P. Chipman. president
of the California State Board of Trade;
M. Greenebaum, a leading merchant of
this city; Collector of Customs Strat
ton and his deputy, William Hamil
ton. â Â¦"Â¦ - â¢Â¦ - Â¦Â¦- Â¦-,'-'
Long before the Siberia hove into
port the wharves were thronged with
the distinguished gentlemen of the re
ception committee, whose pleasure it
was to extend a formal welcome to the
country's visitors. -,\
When the great steamship Siberia
came into port yesterday with forty
seven of the most distinguished citi
zens of the Philippines, aboard, the
event marked a picturesue and impor
tant era in the history of the United
States, for the strangers are the coun
try's guests of honor from afar.
During their sojourn in America they
will be shown the wonders that genius
and industry have reaped from the il
limitable harvest fields of modern
achievement, and as guests of the
country at the St. Louis Exposition
they will be shown object lessons from
the workshops and fields of all the
earth; they will meet the world's mas
ter minds and will see the handiwork
of cunning artisans from all quarters
of the globe, displayed for the enlight
enment of mankind.
So it was a fitting prelude to their
to^ur of research and education that
San Francisco should welcome the vis
itors with that hospitality due the
stranger in a country to which he is
bound by ties of commerce, by political
allegiance and by common interests,
<*ven though the people and the land
are foreign to his mode of life and to
his associations beneath tropic suns.
The committee from the Orient is
comprised of men of renown. Their
achievements have made them lead
ers in their native land, and there is
no doubt that they will return rich
in experience.
Trinidad H. Pardo de Tayera of Ma
nila has been a member of the Phil
ippine Commission ever since 1301. He
was educated in Spain and in France,
and is a skillful physician and diplo
mat. Benito Legarda is also a mem
ber of the United States Philippine
Commission and a graduated lawyer.
He wa3 vice president of the Con
gress that ratified the constitution of

Jose R. de Luzuriaga is also a mem

One. of the most interesting persons
in the commission and one of the
most modest passengers on the Si
beria is Lieutenant General Trias, for

It was while on a visit to her broth
er that Miss Carl met the Empress of
China. Miss Carl is a friend of Min
ister Confer, who stands high in the
esteem of the Empress. As her
brother's sister and as Minister Con
or's friend. Miss Carl found easy ac
cess to the palace. The Empress is
an artist of some skill, and in art the
two found a mutual interest and their
acquaintance ripened into something
e? near as intimacy as possible under
the circumstances. The Empress con
sented to sit to Miss Carl for a por
trait and the masFive box in the Si
beria's hold contains the canvas to
Â¦u-Hlch MIfs Carl transferred in oil the
features of her imperial friend and
eister artist. The painting of the pic
ture occupied two years.
It was carried from Peking to Woo
Fung on a railroad built for the pur
pose at an expense of 250,000 taels. It
v.as placed on the Siberia at Shanghai.
Shen Xang Hoo, who war. Civil Gov
rrnor of the Tungyung C'rcjit, Chili
Province, during the Boxer troubles,
was appointed custodian of the por
trait. Accompanied by his secretary.
Law Chan Poo, he arrived yesterday
on the Siberia and will leave in a few
days on the train that carries the
picture to St. Louis.
Shen Nang Hoo speaks no English,
but would like to, and is so genially
interested in everybody he meets and
everything he see?., that he !s over
working Law Chan Poo, who is also
his interpreter, and who speaks Eng
lish like a Londoner.
The Chinese people, it is said, do not
altogether approve of the. picture's
lraving China, and fears are expressed
that in sending the counterfeit fea
tures of their Empress to a. foreign
land an invitation is extended to the
pods to visit death upon the rash orig
inal of the portrait. The picture,
l:<nvever, is insured for $40,000.
Largest and most interesting of any
'package in the hold of the liner Si
Â¦ beria, which* arrived yesterday from
the, Orient, was the gold-framed por
trait of the Dowager Empress of
China. The frame measures twenty by
ten feet, and the massive case in
which it is packed is of much greater
dimensions. The picture is going in
bond to St. Louis, where it will be the
ftar feature of China's exhibit. At
the close of the exposition the work of
art will be presented, in the name of
the original of the portrait, to the
American people.
The portrait was painted by Miss
Kate Augusta Carl, an American
artist, who was born and raised in
the South. Miss Carl's maternal
grandfather was a surgeon in the
British navy. w ho resigned his com
mission and emigrated to Canada. Her
mother was a cousin of Lady Hart,
end her father a nephew of Baron von
Humboldt. Miss Carl's brother holds
en official position under the Chinese
fiovfrnment and is one of China's
commissioners to the St. Louis Expo
sition.

Governor Carter has before him upon
his return to Honolulu the duty of
making a large number of appoint
ments, and it is to consult with the de
partment concerning these that is the
main object of his visit to Washington.
He is enthusiastic about affairs m
the islands, and particularly about the
local government's financial showing.
He thinks, howeverâ and Is armed with
the figures to prove the Justice of hia
opinionâ that the amount of Govern
ment financial assistance to the island
Territory is smaller than Hawaii's con
tributions to the national treasury
would Justify. He says that only by
practicing the most rigid economy has
his administration been able to make
both ends meat, and as part of this
economy has been the reduction of
school teachers' salaries he expects to
convince the department of Hawaii's
right to a financial lift.

Henry Wallace and Burt Hammesley,
who were working in a mining camp
near Dale, in the desert portion of thiB
county, discovered three skeletons
bleaching in the fun fifty miles east
of Dale. The skeletons were lying
Â¦within 200 feet of each other. There
was no mark of violence about any of
the skeletons, and the supposition is
that they are all that is left of pros-
I>ectors who lost their way and died
in the desert. The bones were given
a decent burial, the place being mark
ed by a little mound of stones like
those that mark many other graves In
the desert.

It was Emil Tschuonl's unlucky even
ing, for after running his automobile
into Michael Holdback at Pine and
Kearny streets he ' went up to the
Olympic Club and lost the amateur
lightweight wrestling championship,
that he had struggled oft and vigor
ously to win and to hold.
In the court of Judge Mogan yester
day Michael Holdback told of how he
had been struck by the chew-chew
machine steered by Mr. Tschuonli A
street magician was oratorlcally claim-
Ing that the quickness of his hand de
ceived the average naked eye, and as
Mr. Holdback prided himself on being
exceptionally sharrf^f vision he paused
to test the prestldigitateur's assertion.
While thus engaged, with optics riveted
upon the dexterous hands of the wizard
and ears temporarily suspended from
duty, he was struck amidships and
from behind. So violent was the im
pact that a moment lapsed before he
fully realized what had happened, and
when he had pulled himself together,
estimated his injuries and investigated
the defendant's conduct he felt that
the issuance of a warrant charging
battery would be Justifiable. So he
caused It to be issued.
Mr. Tschuoni explained that if the
complainant had not been so absorbed
In the exhibition of, manual dexterity
he would have heard the warning toot
of the auto and sidestepped the onset.
But even as it was, the prostration of
Mr. Holdback might have been averted
If the duplex eccentric regulator of the
machine's motive power had not sud
denly and unaccountably balked when
summoned to simultaneously reverse
the action of the port driving rod and
apply the starboard brake.
Judge Mogan, who is somewhat
versed In automobiling, has taken thtÂ»
case under advisement* until he can
consult a select committee of profes
sional chauffeurs as to the advisability
of admitting the technical portion of
Mr. Tschuonl's defense to the record.
He will give the case another inning
next Friday.

Roy Downs' bicycle ride along Mar
ket Btreet was uneventful so long as
he remained "the man behind" a wagon
steered by Barthold Michaels, but when
he tried to get ahead of that vehicle
there was something doing. He says
that as he was passing the wagon
Michaels tacked the horse, with the re
sult that the wheel was upset and Its
rider almost deprived of an ear.' Mr.
Michaels was arrested and will state
his case on June 1 in the court of Judge
Mogan.
Daniel Collins had no license to sell
Intoxicating liquors when he was ar
rested- for doing so in a saloon at the
Presidio, and Judge Fritz fined him $50.
A. Racomml, who sells wine at 3020
Twentieth street, dropped around to the
fruit store of his compatriot, Joe Fredl
ani, at Twenty-first and Florida streets,
for the double purpose of paying an
overdue party call and discussing the
latest political tidings from Italy. Just
what Signor Racommi said or did to
provoke Signor Fredianl's ire has not
been disclosed, because Signor Racom
mi is in a hospital and Signor Fredianl
is reserving his statement for June 2
before Judge Mogan. Signor Racom
mi's injuries consist of a badly battered
head and a severely bruised knee cap,
inflicted, it is alleged, with a beer bot
tle wielded by Signor Frc-dlanl.
Judge Fritz thanked "S. Clark, an
insurance agent, for the pains he took
to have John Louis Lasalle properly
punished for cruelty to a horse.
"If there were more citizens like
you, Mr. Clark," said his Honor,
"there would be less work for us
magistrates, because persons of the
stamp of this defendant would hesi
tate to break the law when there is no
policeman in sight."
Mr. Clark was buggy driving on
Thirty-fifth street when he saw Lasalle
brutally beating a" led horse and his
request that the brutality cease brought
upon him a storm of epithets. So he
had the fellow arrested and neglected
his business to prosecute the case to
a finish. He had the satisfaction of
seeing Lasalle fined $10.
Six small boys, accused of stealing
and imbibing part of a ten-gallon bar
rel of claret from a store on Bernal
Heights, were ably defended in Judge
Mogan's court by. their mothers, who
swore that not one of the defendants
was guilty of the theft.
"While I don't believe you, I can
hardly blame you," said his Honor,
"for the mother who would not stretch
the truth to save her son from im
prisonment for larceny would be as
unnatural as . the neglectful mother.
The case Is continued for one week,
and I would hint that In the meantime
the complainant should be paid for the
wine stolen from him."
The "hint" â¢ was apparently appre
ciated by the matrons who filed in
procession out of court
Matt Larsen was drunk and running
amuck on Market street when Police
Sergeant Patrick Shea,, known alsa
as "the Adonis of the Southern sta
tion," leaped from a passing streetcar,
and, after a sharp struggle, arrested
him. Mr. Larsen appeared in court
with a black eye, but Sergeant Shea's
facial beauty was not impaired by the
encounter. Judge Fritz will pass sen
tence this morning.
"I object to further continuance of
this case," shouted the eloquent and
able counsel. "Day after day my lady
client has been dragged away from
her household duties to appear in this
court "
"Dragged, eh?" interrupted his
Honor Mogan. "Nice way that to
treat a lady. Who dragged her?"
The eloquent and able counsel ex
plained that he did not mean
"dragged" in its literal sense, but. as
the term is colloquially used.
"You relieve me very much," was
'the court's serious rejoinder! "But

Frank L. Coombs, the legal adviser
of the board of directors of the home,
took a proper receipt for $1000 paid by
the treasurer of the home to the
guardian of McDonall.
The business of exploiting accumu
lated pensions is a new industry In
Napa County and is engaging the at
tention of the rawest politicians. The
Interest shown by leading lights of
the Democratic party Is surprising.
The story is current that the canteen
at the home was abolished by Demo
cratic wire pulling to give the liquor
business to the saloons of Yountville.
Ultimately all the State homes for the
care of old soldiers will be closed and
the veterans placed in national homes.
It is the opinion of leading men of
the Grand Army that the closing of
the home in this county and the trans
fer of all the veterans to Santa Monica
will be hastened by the zeal of local
politicians who are scrambling with
equal enterprise for the pensions of
the living and the estates of the dead.
Of course, the cemetery of the home
will remain Jn Napa County, but the
patronage of the occupants will not
enrich the saloon keepers.

Dated Napa, October 17. 1903.
Witness his mark:
MRS. LOUIS C. PETERSON.
LORS PKTERSON.
The discharge of the old veteran
from the home where he had lived for
fourteen years in peace and content
ment was demanded as follows:
Veterans' Home of California, Tountvllle.
Cal.. Colonel George XV. Waltz, commandant.
Sir â I hereby demand my discharge from the
Veterans' Home of California and request
that you send my discharge therefrom, to
rcther with any and all pension vouchers and
other papers now In your possession, to me at
M0 Oak gtreet, Xapa. Cal.. and I hereby state
that I do not intend to return to the Veterans'
Home or to longer continue a member of it.
Respectfully yours.
The old veteran did not long survive
the change from the home to . Napa
City, for he passed away early in April,
leaving among his papers a will dated
September 26, 1903, about the time that
the pressure was greatest to get him
out of the home. He declared in his
will that he was of "sound and dispos
ing mind and memory." At the same
time the court was declaring him in
competent. The will Is a peculiar doc
ument. It gives 10 per cent of his es
tate to Father Conway, the acting pas
tor of the Catholic church at Napa, for
the benefit of the Orphan Asylum of his
chnrch. The residue of the estate Is
bequeathed to Michael Maloney, a vet
eran who assisted in getting the decree
of incompetency, and to Mrs. L. C.
Peterson, In whose residence the aged
veteran was sheltered and who attend
ed him during his last- illness. All re
ports agree that Mr. and Mrs. Peterson
were kind to the old man.
Owing to the good management of
the estate by Robert J. Little, there
remains $1400. If the will stands the
Petersons and Maloney will get the
bulk of the estate. Of course, the at
torneys, Bell, York & Bell, will come in
for a slice and the fixed charges of the
guardian must be paid. If the will does
not stand the money must go to the
State of California or the Veterans'
Home. An' act of Congress says it
must go to the home. Judge Gesford
holds that the State law and not the
Federal statute applies. On the advice
of the Attorney General a case is to the
taken to the Supreme Court from the
Superior Court of Napa County to de
termine once for all whether Judge
Gesford Is right in ignoring the act of
Congress.
POLITICIANS ARE BUSY.
DIES AFTEK LEAVING HO3IE.
Some months ago it was ascertained
by Nape County politicians that the
old veteran had the aum of $1000 to his
credit with the treasurer of the home
and $600 additional deposited in savings
banks. Steps were at once taken to get
him out of the home and also to get
his money out of the home treasury.
Representations, were made to the
court that McDonall was Incompetent
and unable to manage his own affairs.
In fact, the most tender solicitude was
shown for the old veteran as soon as it
was learned that he had $1600 and.no
living relatives. To make a long story
short, the court, adjudged him Incom
petent and appointed Robert J. Little
as guardian of his estate. Demand was
instantly made for McDonall's dis
charge from the home and for transfer
of all the money to his credit with the
home treasurer to the guardian. The
demands were complied with. The
guardian, a man of high character,
took charge of McDonall's affairs.
NAPA, May 27.â Connected with the
will of Thomas McDonall, which has
just been filed in the Superior Court of
this county by Bell, York & Bell, there
is an interesting story. McDonall was
82 years of age when he died. He en
listed in the Third United States Infan
try at Newport, Kentucky, away back
in 1S44. He entered the Veterans'
Home in this county In 1889 and dwelt
there for fourteen years in peace and
comfort. - .

Thirteen months in all were pre

Mrs. Margaret McKenna's five
young children played hide-and-seek
among the spectators In Judge Mo
gan's court while their mother was
undergoing examination on the charge
of having boxed the ears of a three
year-old son of Mrs. Nora Evans,
whose entire offspring were also
among those present.
The IJcKennas live on Brady street,
and on the other side of their back
fence are domiciled the .Evanses,
whose front door is numbered 108 Col

and schooled and married In the vicin
age and Mrs. McKenna became a resi
dent of It only three months ago and Is
still in what might be termed the pro
bationary stage of acceptability as a
neighbor. This fact may have had
something to do with her arrest.
At any .rate, the course taken by Mrs.
Evans to avenge the alleged cuffing of
her son's head established a neighbor
hood precedent, the usual . retaliative
policy in euch cases being to assail the
assailant.
. After the ear-boxing had been de
scribed by Mrs. Evans, with much at
tention to detail,, Mrs. McKenna ac
knowledged guilt and pleaded provoca
tion, stating that her two-year-old
had been attacked by and was locked
in deadly embrace with the Evans
three-year-old when she Intervened

than four years awaiting death for the
murder of Maria Barera, in Bakera

pealed and a new trial granted on the
ground that the murder was not pre
meditated. He was again, convicted
and appealed, but a new trial was de
nied. Ochoa has many sympathizers,
who have tried every way to have the
sentence commuted to life Imprison
ment. The Mexican Consul at New

five hours decided, by a vote of 113 to
75, to return to work. The men quit
their places t-ome months ago without
the sanction of the international body.

employers set up several labor-saving
machines and Imported men from the

strike. When the matter was referred
to International President Tobin he or
dered the men back to work, but they
refused to go. Vice President Lovely
made an investigation and upheld
President Tobin. The members of the
union held out as long as they could,
but when they saw lhat the interna
tional body refused to sanction their
strike they decided to work
and all hands will go back to the shop
this morning.

ane, a brilliant lawyer, member of the
Board of Trustees of the Oakland Free
Public Library, a talented writer for
magazines, died last night at St.
Thomas' Hospital, San Francisco, after

fever. Mr. Evans was taken ill while

â¢ It is within the hopes of the club
that there will be some scheme ad
vanced by the Unjted. Railway^ to put
their system under electric control and
enable the residents along Sutter
street to have, the protection that may
be granted by underground wires.
The club adopted a set of by-laws
and a constitution that will govern .ill
future actions. The. document pro
vides that twelve members shall con
stitute a quorum and that all matters
of vital interest shall be considered
and arrangements made by a board
which shall include the president, vice
president, secretary and treasurer.
Circular letters are to be sent to all
property owners on Sutter-street In or
der to inform them that the club la in
existence and that dues are $1 a
month.' If the property owner is en
gaged in business that requires the
use of a second floor along the thor
oughfare he is only to be charged upon
the basis of 50 cents a month because
he has to pay additional rent and in
creased taxes.
There is going to be another meet
ing of the club on Tuesday, June 14.
at Golden Gate Hall. The by-laws
passed yesterday will be read and fur
ther action agreed upon.
W. H. Hazell, as ftie president of the
club, suggested that matters that
passed through the hands of the
Board of Supervisors required time
and that there would be a question in
volved regarding the curtailment of
the present franchise, which gives the
privilege of conducting a cable sys
tem.
The Sutter-street Improvement Club
asks that in event the present cable
car system on that thoroughfare is
changed to an electric system, that
the trolley wires be placed r* under
ground. It was decided at the meet
ing of the club yesterday afternoon
that the question of underground
wires was the issue the club should
take up.

and Will Take Matter Up at

AN ANTI-SOAP VAGRANT
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, May 27.
A swiftly moving construction ele
vator in the new Union Savings Bank
building struck Henry Nichols in the
face to-day as be looked out of a win
dow in the building. The blow knocked
out nearly all of his teeth, broke liis
nose and left his entire face an i!m
recognizable mass.
Nichols is unable to explain the acci
dent. He says he thrust his head out
of the window in- order to call to a
fellow workman, and remembers noth
ing more. Blood on the elevator, how
ever, marks the point of contact, and
how he escaped more serious injury is a
matter of speculation. - ">* "-
The building 'is eleven stories high,
and the elevator is hoisted by a donkey
engine and runs up and down the tall
structure very quickly. It is supposed
that Nichols put his* head out just as
it was passing the window, with the re
sult that it struck him full in the face
and knocked him back into the build-
Ing.
Nichols is just 21 years of age and
lives at 676 Geary street, San Francisco.
He is employed by the San Francisco
firm of W. S. Snook & Co., plumbers,
at Clay and Montgomery streets, who
have the contract for putting in the
plumbing In the new building.

That Was Sold.
OAKLAND. May 27. â Forty-two
chairs, comprising part of the outfit
of John M. Murray's New Thought In
stitute, 867 Clay street, figured to-day

ray's attempt to recover the furni
ture, claiming he had bought It from
Raymond Schmldler, Murray's nephew
by. marriage.
The New Thought Institute man
ager insisted that- Schmidler's claim
to ownership of the forty-two chairs
and much more New Thought para
phernalia are ill founded. Schmldler
has disappeared. Weighty law pointb
were developed, which induced thÂ«*
court to continue the hearing of the
contest until next Tuesday. Murray
avers it is a case of restocking the in
stitute, or the New Thought propa
ganda will lag so far as he is con
cerned.

Berkeley Offlce San Francisco Call.
Z14S Center Street, May 27.
People within and without the uni
versity circle were greatly surprised
t>y the announcement to-day that Mrs.
Phoebe A. Hearst had withdrawn her
support entirely from the Hearst Do
mestic Industries, an Institution she
founded four years ago to provide the
aicans of self -support for women stu
<Jpnts In the University of California.
But tbl* is not all. for an investigation
has developed that Mrs. Hearst has
withdrawn h*>r patronage from other
1 activities that she l.as long assisted
and given orders to cut down expendi
tures In numerous directions.
Those interested in the university
are asking what it all means, and
there is a doal of gossip and a shaky
feeling among the many that have
looked to Mrs. Hearst for salaries and
assistance. Some are asking whether
it does not mean that Mrs. Hearst is
-preparing to lift her munificent hand
altogether from the university. There
h talk that she has quarreled with the
powers in the university and may
never return to it. Some color is given
'to this idea by Mrs. Hearst's sudden
determination not to build a mansion
in Berkeley after she had actually laid
her plans for it. Some time ago it
vras given nut that she would return
immediately to Berkeley after her ar
rival in New York from a trip around
(he world, but weeks have passed ami
now it is announced that she is about
to return to Europe. She was to have
been h<?re In time for commencement
and to give the senior class the usual
annual outing to Pleasanton, but com
mencement has come and gone and
no word came from Mrs. Hearst.
RESULTS UNSATISFACTORY.
Ill health is given as one of the
causes of Mrs. Hearst's change of at
titude toward the university, but there
would seem to be more potent reasons,
judging from the tenor of the letters
containing notification of her deter
mination to withdraw hfrr support
from university affairs. In her letter
to Miss A. M. Hicks, supervisor of thÂ»
Domestic Industries School, she de
clares that the results obtained do not
Justify further expenditures from her
in behalf of the institution. This mas
be taken to mean that the cost of
maintaining this and other institu
tions has been too heavy a drain upon
the purse strings of Mrs. Hearst, and
. that she must reduce the outflow of
money. It is a fact that Mrs. Hearst
has given to the university in one way
or another a sum approximating
Jl.000,000. and this undoubtedly has
made a deep Impression on her fortune.
Then there is much talk of "graft"
in connection with Mrs. Hearst's
beneficences. There are stories told of
high salaries paid for little work and
of other expenses that have passed the
limit of what might be called reason
able expenditures. Mrs. Hearst has
not openly complained of this system,
but it has been discussed often by peo- |
pie within and without the circle.
The story of Mrs. Kearst'g with
drawal of support from the domestic
industries nohool waÂ«Â» precipitated by
the publication of a dispatch in the ;
morning paper? that *he had formally
dt dined to further assist a kindergar
ten training school she t-stabllshed in
Washington eight years ago and whieh
hat since borne her name. It appears
lh2t 5he announced to the directors
of the institution that she oould no ;
longer stand the expense of J16.000 re- :
â¢quired to .v.aintain it. as the condition i
of her finances would no longer permit
the outlay, certain of her invAtments
"having turned <-at to b? unprofitable.
. " POJ.K~V OF REDCCTlbX.
m Now Mrs. Hearst's action in regard
to the Washington school seems to por
.tend a policy of reduction in the cost
of the activities she has Hitherto sup
ported at th* University of California.
Ue r attitude tc-ward the training school
ffc exactly the name as that she has
assumed toward the domestic indus
tries Bchool. The school here has cost
her not 1ofb than $10,000 to main
tain and she feels now that she can
,po longer afford that large amount.
Mrs. Hearst evidently feels the same
way nix, ut the Yo-ung Women'Â« Chris
tian AFsociation, to which she has al
vays given liberally. Hearst Hall and
the women's clubs. This year she gave
nothing to the Young Women's Chris
tian Association and her support was
CTeatly missed at the recent Capitola
conference. In Hearst Hall -she has
Cut down expense* in the culinary de- |
partment and dismissed a night watch
man the had employed. The women's
clubs she has left now to support
.themselves, although it was the un
derstanding that they would eventu
ally become self-supporting. Thus it
is easy to see that the university's
benefactress is curtailing the outgo in
every direction.
The Hearst Domestic Industries
School was designed to open the way
for girls seeking to support them
selves through college. Fine sewing
was taught them and they were paid
at the rate of twenty cents an hour
from the beginning, Â«o It. really gave
each girl a scholarship. Orders were
taken for sewing and the school made
pelf -supporting so far as possible. Even
with the money earned, however, the
school was a source of great expense
to Mrs. Hearst and she found herself
compelled to spend annually something
like $10,000. Â¦
GIVES XO WARNING.
"Mrs, Hearst did not give us any
earning of what she intended to do,"
said Miss Hicks, the supervisor of the
Ecbooi to-day. "She simply wrote that
ehe had decided to withdraw her sup
port because the results did not Justify
further sacrifices. It Is possible that
we may be able to continue the school
and I am hopeful that we will re
ceive assistance from some-, other
source."
Neither President Wheeler nor any
of Mrs. Hearst's representatives could
be found to-day and, therefore, no
definite statement could be obtained as
to whether. 'she intends ultimately to
withdraw ' her support entirely from
the university.

flaw In the delicate work before him
he turned the article Into a common

Importation of Fruits.
One of the many proofs of the vast
ly increased consumption of fruits
among the American people is seen in
the fact that in 1S99 a little mofe than
a million bunches of bananas were ex
ported from Honduras to the United
States. In 1903 the total exceeded two
millions, and consular estimates- put
the probable aggregate in 1904 at three
millions. And imported fruits of many
kinds have fallen off in price as the
years have gone on. The variety of
diet within the reach of families of
moderate means in this quarter of
the world is gratifying to . note, and
the Yankee table, as a rule, is more
bountifully spread for" this generation
than it was for the majority, of our
ancestors.
Gold in' a Statuette.
Many old-fashioned French people
are given to stowing away their pe
cuniary possessions in odd nooks and
corners, often to the bewilderment of
their heirs. A- characteristic story
comes from the environs of Paris, the
heroine of the adventure being an old
lady who expired a few months ago.
She had put by a certain amount of
money, which she bequeathed to two
nephews. One of them waived his
rights in favor of his brother, merely
asking to be allowed to keep a little
statuette as a souvenir of their de
parted relative. One day the servant
of this self-denying individual hap
pened to break the statuette, and. to
the amazement of its owner a lock of
hair, a medallion, and, last.\iot least,
a number of 1000-franc bank notes
dropped out from .among the frag
ments. He retained these articles as
THE meeting of the large number of people who
. are interested in rectification of the rivers which:
cause destructive floods did not result in either the
discussion or presentation of any plan. We fear that
more discussion in the future was caused by preventing
any now than would have occurred in this convention
had expression been free. Enough^ was developed: to
show that certain irreconcilable differences exist between
delta and tule land owners on the south side of 'the
San Joaquin and owners of similar lands in the flood
district. ; v
Perhaps it is better to say that it was developed that
a plan of rectification that would make safe property now
overflowed on the Sacramento might overflow on the San
Joaquin property that is now. safe. The two systems and
the two rivers will have to be kept distinct, treated dif
ferently and not merged in one-^plan if we are to have
fair unanimity, in the. proposed work: The cities of Sac
ramento and Stockton depend for the benefit of .'their
commerce and the, regulation of their freights uponfthe

people of, the State that no competition can kill or injure
the patronage given to these pathetically afflicted people.
THE RIVER CONVENTION.
A LEGAL OPINIONâ M.. Sierra
ville, Cal. The question asked is one
that involves a legal opinion, such as
can only be given when one has heard
all the facts of the case, as much for
a correct answer depends upon a
knowledge of all the facts. Possibly
the question might be answered by
addressing a letter of inquiry to the
nearest United States Land Office,
where similar cases may have been
passed upon, but the letter of inquiry
should give a concise statement of
claims by both sides.
The .divorce court of San Francisco has been, times
without number, the scene of unexpected and inexplicable
incidents of the matrimonial puzzle, but when a man sued
his spouse for a divorce the other day on the ground
that she didn't tajk enough to him observers shook their
heads in wonder. What manner of a man must this; be
to object to what centurie*s of Christian education have
crystallized into a blessing?
The Finger Print.
The finger print method of personal
identification seems to be coming to
the front. It has long been used as
an adjunct to the Bertillon system of
measurement and now we are told
that in England it is superseding that
system, , being regarded as both sim
pler and surer. The trouble with any
measurement system is that the meas
urements of the same man taken by
different persons or at different ages
will differ clightly, and so the identi
fication may fail. Finger prints, on
the other hand, tell their own story
and are subject* to no "personal equa
tion"; while their systems of ridges
and whirl! remain the same from in
fancy to manhood. In a recent Euro
pean case reported in a French pa
per a murderer was detected through
the agency of a-thumb. print on the
rail of a broken sash â so slight a
mark that it was scarcely visibleâ
but photography enabled it â¢ to be
studied sufficiently for identification.â ,

Itself to conduct its business on
"Christian principles" â certainly a
novel combination in these days â and
to devote all its profits over 5 per cent
to improving the condition of the na
tive*. That is where the phil
anthropy comes in; also in agreeing
to wait until 1910 for possible divi
dends.
The London Missionary Society has
indorsed the project. George Cadbur>'i
the great Quaker cocoa manufacturer
and newFpaper proprietor, and W. H.
Lever, millionaire soapmaker, both of
whom are renowned for dividend
paying philanthrophy in the shape of
"Garden Cities" for their employes,
have each offered to take $5000 worth
of shares. Many other prominent
business men have pledged their sup
port.
Mr. Walker, the originator and
backbone of the enterprise, 'belongs to
that type of evangelists popularly de
fined as a broad-gauge Christian. He
makes light of distinctions of creed
and for the doctrine of eternal dam
. nation expresses open scorn. He is a
healthy, clear-skinned, virile man of
strong convictions and lots of pluck.
Once, to prevent a shindy among the
natives, he visited, unarmed, a witch
doctor named Tokerieu, who was in
citing the savages against the white
men, and sought to convince him of
the error of his way. Only by fieetness
of foot did he escape being murdered
by Tokerieu's enraged followers, who
probably would have made a meal of
him afterward. But when the writer
asked him if he had ever been in any
tight corners in Xew Guinea, he said,
â¢'None worth speaking of." and the
story was got from somebody else.
Put the two things together and they
give a good idea of the character of
the man.
"It must not be supposed," he said,
* "that because I am now engaged in
. industrial undertaking I have lost
faith in the efficacy of missions among
the heathen. But missions alone do
not go far enough. Too often they
merely pave the way for the rapacious,
. unscrupulous trader and the devas
tating blight of what is miscalled civi
lization.
"The Question that confronts us is
'â¢simply whether the same wholesale
degradation and destruction of sav
age races that has taken place in
other parts of the globe is to be re
!peated in New Guinea. If philan
thropic effort continues to concern it
self alone with seeking to convert the
natives to Christianity they are inev
itably doomed. If philanthropy can
be brought to recognize that they have
bodies to save that are worth saving
as well as souls, then they may es
cape extinction and be developed into
useful Industrial communities.
"Their natural occupation is fight
ing. In dealing with them it Is not
enough to cast out that 'one devil.'
When the fighting ceases they have
practically nothing to do. They must
fuse to the bomb and he immediately
spread the alarm.
"The Englisher up In 371 has let loose
a lot of black plague bugsâ says we'll
all be dead men before morning. I
think me mother wants meâ I have to
go now." He disappeared like a shad
ow. There bega*n to be a general move
ment doorward on the part of the bell
hops.
Then the shadow of terror crept into
the grill. The gay after-theater diners
began to see the air swimming with
black specks. One old man with an
apoplectic countenance felt a cramp in
his leg and immediately began to call
for a doctor. The hurry call for car
riages startled the drivers out on the
curb. Fear spread on the wings of
thought.
In the midst of the alarm came Pro
fessor Reginald Sans-Hicks, a smile
illumining his face from one sideburn
to the other. He stepped Into the ex
cited throng about the office and held
up a deprecating hand.
. "Really, now. my good people, there
Is nothing to be alarmed about after

arily mislaid those bottles in ray lug

"Ragging" at Oxford.
The custom of "ragging" at Oxford,
to which the public in England has re
cently been devoting considerable at
tention, seems to be a kind of intermit
tent and in some cases continued haz
ing of certain students, done according
to system and professedly with certain
ends in view. Usually it takea the form
of some sort of personal violence or in
dignity to a student or an injury to his
belongings, and it has been known to
prevent some students from finishing
their courses. The number of things
for which a student may be "ragged"
is indefinite, but the principal ones are
thus enumerated' by a London news
paper which sent a correspondent to
Oxford to investigate the practice:
"Wearing patent leather shoe3 during
the first vear at Oxford.
Carrying a walking stick when in cap
and gown.
"Wearing a silk hat. '
"Wearing cap and gown, except when
unavoidable.

THE SUNDAY CALL MAGAZINE.
A MAGAZINE to be wholly successful, in the face
of the keen competition that is the life of twentieth
century . progress- and research, must contain
something of interest to everybody, something not only
attractive and entertaining, but instructive as well.
It is the combination of all these elements that has
made the Sunday Call magazine so immensely popular.
Though it is primarily a California paper, published for
the people of California in particular and the entire Pa
cific Coast in general, it draws its subjects all quar
ters of the globe in order to make its pages as diversified
as possible. Tn this respect it is of world-wide interest
and importance. :/':â¢;*-'
First and as an element in the Sunday Call's
success is its literary excellence. It has gained wide
recognition for its articles and stories of fact and fiction
written by men and women whose names have world
wide prominence and significance. .
As an instance the Sunday Call to-morrow will con
tain "The Debut of Bimbashi Joyce," by A. Conan Doyle,
whose Sherlock Holmes stories arc not more exciting
than this latest creation of his subtle pen. The scene of
the story itself is laid in Egypt, about which this famous
author knows more than any other writer of the day, and
his characters are the soldiers of the British empire and
the mystics of the Nile.
. As a good con tn. st to the "Debut of Bimbashi Joyce"
there is a thrilling story by an American author, a writer
who in his own peculiar field is as famous as A. Conan
Doyle. This is Frank H. Spearman, who, though he has
made "Bucks" one of the most notable and powerful
figures in his railroad stories, has never before made him
the hero of any one of them. This he has done, expressly
for the Sunday Call to-morrow, and "Bucks' " Christmas
night adventure with his own mother's life at stake
forms one of the most pathetic but at the same time*
thoroughly endearing- . stories that Spearman has ever
written. Moreover it shows "Bucks" in his true char
a'ctcr for the first time to those who have grown to love
this character.
Other writers whose names will be recognized for the
excellence of their work are Albert Sonnichsen, who has
an article on "How the Little Japs Fire Big Guns," which
is a personal experience of his own aboard the Yashima
just before the outbreak 'of the present war; Jerome K.
Jerome, whose article on "Hot Stoves I Have Met" is far
more keenly witty than its ludicrous title would seem to
suggest; William J. Shearer, the grc^t Eastern educator,
who writes exclusively for the Sunday Call on the "Sor
rows and Fears of Children" and .how to deal with them;
Headon Hill, whose novel of the workings of the dreaded
Third Section that guards the life of the present Czar of
Russia entitled "By a Hair's Breadth" will be completed
in this.' the fourth and last installment; S. L. Tinsley,
whose dainty little "Half-Hour Storiettes" are as famous
in their way as Anthony Hope's "Dolly Dialogues," h/s
contributed his new story, "The Interrupted Flight," as
has also Jasper Collingwood with his "Bascom's Aris
tocracy."
However, of more pointed and peculiar interest to
women, as well as being timely to a degree, is the brightly
illustrated page by Miss Adele Bruges of New York and
Newport on "How to Pack a Trunk," which has sud
denly become one of the most' lucrative professions open
to young women.
There is also a page on "The Apron Girl of 1904," with
the answers to "What Women Want to Know," which
has become one of the most conspicuous and popular
features of the Sunday. Call magazine.
Likewise of genuine pictorial merit is the page of the
"Fans of the Nations," which is absolutely unique,
though pictorially the first page of the Sunday Call to
morrow will attract instant attention for the dash and
spirit of the June Calendar Girl in a chic and novel cos
tume of flaming red that adorns it, while the music of
the "Legend of the Crow," which will be found on the
back page of the same section, ready to play, will un
doubtedly be whistled and sung everywhere.
These, however., are only a few of the features in the
Sunday Call to-morrow.
Our Coast Lights.
There are 9000 burning lights and sig
nals stretched along the American
coasts, forming a perfect link, so that
the navigator never need be beyond
sight Â«Â£ tfne of the beacons. One thou
sand of these are located on the Atlan
tic Coast, 1500 are scattered along the
rivers and inland waterways, 500 on the
Great Lakes and 200 on the Pacific
Coast. Of the grand total, including
lighthouses of different classes, buoys,
beacons and danger signals. 3000 are
lighted, giving forth their warnings at
night time. Of these a score or more
throw a beam of 100.000 candle-power.
To maintain the lighthouse service a
corps* of over 4000 men is constantly
employed and a fleet of more than fifty
vessels. Xo service in the world ex
ceeds our own in completeness and ef
ficiency. A modern AmerVan light
house of. the first class. costs between
$100,000 and $200,000. and of this about
one-third is spent for the electric light
and apparatus alone. Beside one of
them Egyptian Canopus, or Rhodes'

HEADQUARTERS OF THE CALL,
5 HENRIETTA STREET. COVENT
GARDEN. LONDON. May 18. â After
spending many years in New Guinea â
Fix as a trader, eight as a missionary â
. the Rev. F. W. Walker has returned
to England to proclaim a new doctrine
of salvation for the heathen by means
- of philsnthrophy that pays 5 per cent.
And it is likely to be tried. A com

The Scourge of Sans-Hicks.
It was a night or terror at a down
town hotej.
Professor Reginald Sans-Hicks, Fel
low erf the Royal Academy, member
of the British Bacteriological Associa
tion and vice president of the Societie
Biologique of Paris, had lost his germs
of the black plague somewhere there in
the big hostelry. The first shock of
terror came when Professor Reginald
Sans-Hicks madly summoned the head
clerk to his room by telephone.
"My dear fellow, I have either been
robbed or I have lost my cultures of
plague that I have brought with me
from India," were his frenzied words.
"They were In thr^e small bottles,
tightly corked and labeled; but if one
of these bottles should be opened here
in the hotel half of us would be dead
men before morning. It is the black
plague, mind youâ the black plague.
If some bounder has stolen those bot
tles and opens them here in the hotel
we will all be lostâ San Francisco will
be lost!" â¢
They revived the clerk with whiskey
down in the office and immediately he
began to reach for his hat and coat.
"Me for Oakland." he gasped, as he
ducked out of the office on the lope.
One of the bellhops had listened at
the door when Sans-Hlcks had set the

or the 'seven other devils' â white
men's devils, some of them â will en

ple will be 'worse than the first* "
If Australia be regarded as a con
tinent. New Guinea becomes the larg
est island in the world, being about
1400 miles long and 490 broad at its
greatest width. It possesses magnif
icent mountain ranges, much â¢ land
that is fruitful even under native cul
tivation, mighty rivers that take their
rise far inland, one of them, the Fly
â¢River, being sixty miles wide 'at its
mouth and navigable 1000 miles from
the sea. The greater portion of the
country is still unexplored.
Here, for the most part Mill utter- ',
ly unacquainted with either the vir- ,
tues or the vices of civilization, dwells
the Papuan. As Mr. Walker describes
him he Is generally a little man. lithe
and slim, seldom exceeding five feet
four inches in height. His huge shock
of frizzled hair is his .most prominent
feature. It serves him as a pillow by
night and a protection from the
scorching rays of the sun by day.
Probably knowing that he would
not appreciate it. nature has not lav
ished any beauty upon him. But he
strives to make himself several de
grees uglier than originally designed
and generally succeeds. He tattoos
his skin in patches and streaks his
face with ochers, red, black and
white being his favorite colors. He
dyes his teeth black. He bores a hole
in the septum of his nose, and in it
inserts a long shell. His ears are usu
ally- so cut and torn that the lobes
hang down in a festoon several inches
long. In his natural state he emu
lates the example set by Adam and
wears only a broad leaf around his
loins, making his mutilated ears sup
ply the lack of artificial pockets.
From a white man's point of view
nearly all of his tastes are perverted.
He loves dirt. His personal habits are
unspeakably filthy. Though he may live
close to the clear, blue sea or a pure
mountain stream, he never bathes for
the sake of cleanliness. His nose has
gene all wrong. He seems to delight in
fcul odors. He will evince disgust when
given a bottle of perfume to sniff at,
but delightedly wears in his armlets
the leaves of some plant that fairly
stinks. He dotes on mustard or pickled
onions, but abominates sweets.
When he has renounced cannibalism
he is practically a vegetarian, fish and
pork being his rare luxuries. The pig
not only shares his home. with him. but
when young shares the maternal breast
equally with the baby. Besides com
pelling his wife to rear the family pig.
he usually makes her do whatever hard
work is to be done. For this reason he
takes care not to disable her perma
nently when he chastises her.
Though in his natural state his chief
occupation is fighting, warfare as civ
ilized man understands it is incompre
hensible to him. Here and there a man
may distinguish himself by personal
courage in openly attacking his enemy
and expose himself to the risk of get
ting speared, but it is .not the usual
Papuan method of fighting. He is an
assassin; seldom a warrior. Even when
he attacks a white man who is defense
less he usually conceals his purpose un
der a show of friendliness. A blow
from behind is always his favorite
blow. All his emotions are shallow. His
heart is as limited in feeling as his
mind is restricted in thought. He can
neither strongly hate his enemy or love
his friend â incidentally, there Is no
! word for love in his language. He may
: torture and eat the enemy, and howl
and lacerate his face with sharp stones
for the loss of his friend, but it is not
deep feeling which prompts either ac
tion; it is custom that demands it. His
chief skill is shown in constructing ca
noes and weapons. Of these the most
characteristic is the man-catcher. It
consists of a loop of rattan cane with
a pike inserted in the handle. The loop
is fhrown over the unhappy wretch who
is in retreat, and a vigorous pull from
the arm of the vengeful captor Jerks
the victim upon the spike, penetrating
the base of the lirain. It is murder re
duced to a fine art.
Such is the Papuan as Mr. Walker
depicts him. He is a pretty low down
lot, and one finds himself wishing that
the philanthropy plus 5 per cent by
which it is proposed to save him from
extermination by civilization had been
tried on some races now well nigh ex
tinct who were more worthy of it.
THE BureaÂ» of Statistics at Washington furnishes
figures telling of the debts, revenues and wealth
of the principal nations, which are of interest at
the beginning of a Presidential campaign, in which many
wild statements will be made on that' subject.
' The statistics account for certain persistent movements
'in population, which are beginning to enlist the attention
of Americans, who think that immigration is becoming
first among our problems. People migrate from one v
country to- another to 'secure better conditions and
better opportunities. Although South America ; is
sparsely populated and_ rich in resources, much of it
enjoying an alluring and wholesome climate, the tide of
immigration flows to North America and is unequally
divided between the United States and the Dominion of
Canada.
This must have two causes. One no doubt is that
immigrants follow their kin and townsmen who have
found better, conditions. The great immigration to the
United States began in the revolutionary period of con
tinental Europe in the first half of the nineteenth cen
tury and in the time of the Irish famine. Those immi
grants found public land ready for their occupancy here
and at once emerged from difficult and narrow conditions
into contentment and prosperity. The glad story went
back to their neighbors and countrymen, and the United
States was established in the minds of migrating Euro
peans as the Eldorado and the Happy Valley. This
accounts for much of our immigration from Northern
Europe. That from Southern Europe, however, is mod
ern, new, and comes here to escape intolerable conditions
which have rendered it less fit for incorporation into our
free society.
The following figures, which we tabulate for the con
venience of those who may desire to preserve or use
them, tell a story that is impressive:
Population. Revenue.
United States 80,372,00'.! $004,621,000

I The German empire is omitted for reasons in its con
stitution. It is composed of separate kingdoms, which
are constitutional monarchies with their own budgets,
j and between the empire itself and such general govern
ments as Great Britain and the United States the
! analogy is too faint to furnish material for comparison.
I Of the four great nations â our own, Great Britain,
i France and Russia â we have the least debt and revenue
j and the greatest wealth. Our debt is not 1 per cent ol
our wealth, England's is 6 l A per cent, Russia's 10 per
cent, France's 12 per cent, Italy's 17 per cent.
But population must be considered and the per capita
of debt and wealth explains why some nations are able
i to sustain a large debt and carry it without blighting
\ their prosperity, while in other nations debt becomes a
j burden so great that the people migrate and expatriate
i themselves to escape it. The per capita of debt and
wealth is shown in this table:
Per Per
Capita Capita
: Debt. Wealth.
United States * $11.51 $1178
United Kingdom 92 .59 1440
France 150.32 2230
Russia 24.21 226
Austria-Hungary , Â¦. â¢ 24 . 3!) 500
Italy 78.85 IR8
Spain 110.72 666
: Our per capita of debt is the least, but in per capita
! of wealth Great Britain and France pass us, and we -arc
' third in the group, while Russia passes into another class
j and takes her place with the poor countries. In this
; table we have an explanation of the great immigration
i we are receiving from Southeastern Russia, Austria
| Hungary and Italy. In Italy the debt is about 17 per
: cent of the wealth per capita. No wonder that the peo
! pie seek to escape to a country where the debt is less
j than 1 per cent of the per capita wealth. The financial
j condition is made more appalling by the revenue rer
quired. To tax out of a population that has only $468
wealth per capita $.375,000,000 is to progressively sap the
resources of a country down to. the point of universal
poverty.'
In comparing our per capita of wealth with France
and Great Britain we have to take into consideration the
fact that they are both old countries. Their industries
were highly organized before the white man had made a
lodgment in North America. Our accumulation of
wealth was slow in our colonial period and it may be
said truthfully that our gain of a surplus for use in pro
ducing more began about sixty years ago. With this
element of time considered our ; showing is improved.
The foregoing figures should lift the melancholy
shadows that are invoked by the partisan pessimist who
insists that this country is as bad as any and worse than
some. .Â¦ ~#-K'-r

Joaquin rivers. Any proposition to help the navigability
of one river at the expense of the other will, therefore,
be fought by whichever city suffers.
It would have been better to thrash these issues out
in the convention. The professional engineers to whom
the whole matter was referred are under implied instruc
tions to report a feasible plan, effective and final, that
will be supported by all -parties concerned. Surely they
would h^ve. been aided by a discussion that would have
developed the,- existing and permanent points of dis
agreement and agreement. '
When their rep'ort is made it is hoped that it will
be unanimously supported. But ir it is not because of
features that are injurious to part of the . people in
interest then the whole matter will have to be discussed
a,nd doubtless at greater length than if debate had pre
ceded the adoption of a plan.
However, the. organization's formed, as its plans will
soon be. and then we can judge more correctly of their
relation to all rig+its.

BUFFALO, N. Y., 'May 27. â The
Presbyteriun General Assembly of the
United States to-day declared in favor
of a union with the Cumberland Pres
byterian church by a vote so nearly
unanimous that it was not counted.
Resolutions adopted recommend cer
tain other steps to be taken to secure
the union of the churches and to make
plain the position Qf the church. The
question of the proposed basis of union
will now go to the presbyteries of the
General Assembly. If it is approved
by a vote of two thirds of them, the
necessary steps will be taken at the
next General Assembly Â¦ to effect the
union.
S. LOUIS, May 27.â After two days'
discussion of the matter the Episcopal
Diocesan Convention of Missouri by a
good majority voted against the use
of the revised version of the Bible in
the prescribed service of the church.
Laymen were stronger than the clergy
in making the vote decisive. The clergy
voto was 12 for the revised version and
19 against and that of the laity 9 for
and 26 against.
Applause followed the announcement
of the vote and while Bishop Spell^
meyer in vain rapped for order, ttfe*
conference arose and sang "Praise God,
From Whom All Blessings Flow."
Prior to the disposition of the amuse
ment question, Dr. F. D. Bovard was
elected editor of the California Chris
tian Advocate. â¢
The conference voted to extend aid
to seven partially self-supporting
church papers, the amounts voted
ranging from $2000 to $250 each per
annum.
E. M. Randall of Tacoma, Wash., was
elected secretary of the Epworth
League and J. T. McFarland of Topeka,
Kan., secretary *f the Sunday School
Union. Both elections were hotly con
tested and it required half a dozen bal
lots in each case to arrive at a choice.
An aye and no vote was demanded
for the first time during the present
conference. This same subject was the
only question precipitating an aye and
no vote in the General Conference
of four years ago at Chicago. The call
ing of the roll occupied the remainder
of the afternoon session. -'.,.!/-
The conference limited the speeches
upon the question to five minutes.
Nearly a score of speeches were made
on both sides before the vote was
taken. Among those who spoke were
J. T. Bartholomew, Willimantic, Conn.;

LOS AXGELES, May 27.â By the de
' cisive aye and no vote of 441 to 183,
the Methodist General Conference this
. afternoon declined to make any change
1 in the church discipline in the matter
i of prohibited amusements. The ques
i tion is one which has agitated the
| minds of the delegates to the present
'. General Conference perhaps more than
any other single problem that has been
before it. The church at large took a
wide interest in the subject of the pro
posed striking out of the specified pro
hibited am'usements from the discipline
'and many memorials and -petitions
i from all parts of the country reflected
| popular opinion in the church on the
| matter. In all sixty-five have been re
! ceived, fifty-five of which opposed any
; change in the discipline on this point,
! and ten favored various changes. A
I single petition from Binghamton, N. Y.,
\bearing 2000 signatures, was one of the
'Â¦ protests against any change being
1 made.

RESCl'ING THE AGED INMATES OF THE CROCKER OLD PEOPLE'S HOME
AT PINE AND PIERCE STREETS WHICH WAS DAMAGED HY FIRE YES
TERDAY MORNING. FORTUNATELY NO ONE WAS INJURED.
Â¦ .When the fire broke out and the
cry of "fire" was raised a panic al
most ensued. There are 131 inmates
and of that number forty-five ore
women. The average age is 68, though
there are several who have passed the
80 mark. Superintendent McKelvey,
assisted by the employes, did all that
was possible to allay the fears of the
old people and get them to places of
safety.
The damage to the structure is con
fined to the west wing of the roof and
by water. The fire was a blind one,
making it extremely difficult to fight.
It was necessary to chop into the roof
to get at the burning Interior.
By the time water could be played
on the roof dense clouds of smoke were
escaping from every portion on the
upper floor. Employes of the home
made hurried trips through the vari
ous rooms and assisted the more fee
ble to the lower floors and into the
street. Many of the. old people want
ed to wait and pack up their effects
and in one or two instances it was
necessary 'to use* force" to" get them
from the building, which appeared to
be floomed. *
As rapidly as the inmates were tak
en to the street they were given shel
ter in the residences of the neighbor
hood. Dr. Rumwell, physician in
charge at the home, with the assist
ance of Dr. Perry, visited each one
and where quieting lotions were nec
essary administered them.
What was feared would prove a dis
astrous fire damaged the* Crocker Old
.People's Home at Pine and Pierce
streets yesterday noon to the extent of
$1000. Many of the inmates were
badly frightened and are suffering
from nervous shock. No serious re
sults are expected, as prompt treat
ment was given the inmates that were
affected Jay the excitement.
About 10 o'clock in the morning one
of the janitors discovered a smolder
ing fire near the chimney on the west
side of the building. He extinguished
the fire, as he supposed, and reported
the- matter to Superintendent Charles
McKelvey. Two hours later smoke
began pouring Into the upper halls
and escaping from the roof. An alarm
was turned in at once and as quickly
as the department reached the scene
a second alarm was sounded.
That Â¦ In Â»Â«ld petition the facts of your ora
tor's existence anflofthe marriage of your
orator to Mary B. Johnson and his interest in
said e~state were fraudulently concealed trom
said court of Marin County, although the ex
istence of your orator and his sa!d marriage
and his said interest In the estate of said de
cedent were well known to tho petitioner
Frank Hansford Johnson and said Frank K.
Johnson,, his guardian, and to the other par
ties to said agreement, viz., Thomas H. Wil-
Uama Jr. and said George E. Williams.
And your orator shows further that beforo
the said petition to said court of Marin County
had been filed an agreement had been made
between paid Thomas H. Williams Jr. and
said minor, through his guardian. Frank S.
Johnson, and consented to by George E. Wil
liamn, that said questions of law and fact
should be concealed and kept from said court.
Â¦ It Is recited that a decree was en
tered on August 1, 1S96, allowing the
minor to give his consent as prayed
for; that on August 12, 1S96, the estate
was appraised as of the value of $1,465,
800 08; that on December 15, 1896,
Thomas H. Williams. Jr. filed a petition
for final distribution, and that on Jan
uary 5, 1S97, the court entered a decree
of final distribution in the following
proportions: Forty per cent to the in
fant Frank Hansford Johnson; 26 2-3
per cent to Thomas H. Williams Jr. in
fee, and 33 1-3 per cent to remain in the
hands of the testamentary trustee un
der the trust for the benefit of Thomas
H. Williams Jr. during his life time.
Goodrich alleges that he had no no
tice of any of these proceedings. He
further avers that after he arrived In
San Francisco with the remains of his
deceased wife ha was informed by
George E. Williams that complainant's
wife had no interest in the estate of
her deceased father, or property of any
kind or character whatever, and that
she herself left no estate. The com
plainant asks for an accounting of the
rents and profits; that the defendants
be enjoined from Incumbering or trans
ferring any of the property, and that
the court ascertain the portion of the
estate due to him.
The complaint further recites that on
August 1, 1896, the infant Frank Hans
ford Johnson, in the Superior Court of
Marin County, asked for leave to con
sent to a decree of distribution of the
estate of Thomas H. Williams, de
ceased, and recites as follows:
In a complaint containing about 30,
000 words, filed yesterday In the Unit
ed States Circuit; Court, George G.
Goodrich of New York alleges that he
Is entitled to a share in the estate of
Thomas H. Williams deceased, and
that He has been defrauded out of it.
He asks that the court restrain- the
defendants from disposing of. trans
ferring or incumbering the estate and
that they be required to render to the
court an accounting of the rents, is
sues and profits thereof. Johnson &
Johnson are his attorneys.
* The defendants are John W. Ferris,
individually and as. a trustee, Frank
Hansford Johnson an infant, Frank S.
Johnson, as guardian of the estate of
said Infant, Thomas H. Williams Jr.,
Thomas H. Williams (secc-nd), an in
fant; Georgie E. Williams, daughter,
and Jennie E. Williams, widow of and
heirs at law of George E. Williams, de
ceased.
The complaint recites that Thomas
H. Williams of San Francisco died on
February 28, 1886, leaving Sherrod Wil
liams, Thomas H. Williams Jr.. Mary
Bryant Williams (who intermarried
with Frank S. Johnson), Percy Wil
liams and Bryant Williams as his
heirs, each to one-fifth of his estate.
It is recited that on December 29, 1S3S,
Mary B. Johnson was divorced in the
Marin County Superior Court and on
December 7, 1889, was married to the
complainant. She died in New York
October 8, 1893, leaving a son, Frank
Hansford Johnson, who is alleged to be
entitled to one-half her estate, her hus
band claiming heirship to the remain
ing half.
The following are the contentions of
the complainant:
- The trust attempted to be created by the
will of Thomas H. Williams, deceased, was
and is void; that the absolute power of alien
ation of the property of Thomas H. Williams,
testator Included In said attempted trust was,
by said will and ,b>' the terms of the trust at
tempted to be created, suspended for the term
of three year* and not for a period measured
by the continuance of lives in beinr, and
that as â¢ to the property, included in said
attempted trust, Thomas H. Williams died
Intestate, and that at his death the said prop
erty passed to and vested in. his said heirs at
law in the proportions before mentioned.

out saying, for Mansfield dees nothing
that he does not do well, but it seemed
clear from the manner in which the
performance was received that the en
joyment did not nearly equal expecta- .
lion*. i
Despite the very obvious moral, so
often and so persistently insisted upon,
the story at bes^t is but a freak, depend
ent for its success solely upon the
literary Bkill of the gifted man who
wrote it. There is nothing in it that
appeals to human sympathy, or to any
emotion <;ther than that excited by the
weird and the horrible. Mansfield made i
ih" uiot-t that could be made of it by!
his p<'nius and his magnetism, assisted
by adventitious aid that stage appli
ances can give. In hi? hands Dr. Jekyll
appeared always in the light, upright
and nobie, while Mr. Hyde was Been
always in the dark, crouching and hid
Â«<tus. Jekyll had the benefit of the
brightness of sunshine and the bloom
flowers; Hyde had the doom of a
creature of darkness made visible
througb the gloom of shadows only by
reason of some sepulchral gleams of
greenish light thrown skillfully upon i
just tho^e parts of his figure whose '
ghastly pallor could emphasize the
darkness Â«>f the rest.
By reason of that treatment of the i
play, Mr. Mansfield avoided the need i
of attempting any change in the make
up of the two parts. The shifting of
* the voice from the natural key to a
d n tp bass was all that was needed in
ihr- change from darkness to light to
bring out the full difference between
the good and the evil nature of the
character, who is at once the hero and
the villain of the play.
That much Mr. Mansfield achieved; i
the remainder of the illusion was due
wholly Jo the Imaginations of the j
audience upon which his genius played.
Th<^ Srst appearance of Mr. Hyde
entering, as a murderer, the home in
which a short time before he had beon i
.welcomed as the betrothed of a beau- |
tiful girl, w.i? almost oppressive iniits
intensity, and the startled feeling^ of
the audience was manifested by a.
genuine shudder. No equal effect,
however, was produced at any suc
ceeding stage of the play until the last
ftct, when Mr. Mansfield had the op
portunity of doing some of the best
Tnotic-cal acting that has ever been |
Feen here. In that act he came as near Â¦
as it is possible for any actor to come !
toward awakening a sympathetic re- i
Bponse from an audience to the agony !
of the man who feels that the good ;
ar.jrel of his nature is about tu forsake
him forever, leaving him no choice
â¢ save that of suicide, or death as a ;
felon upon the gallows. That scene
Eived the play and furnished some- ,
thing which will be remembered among ;
the triumphs of this engagement.
The parts played by the minor char
acters tÂ»f the drama were small. In
every case each was done with suffi
Â«:<"nl force to sustain the interest in
the development of the plot, and yet in
rio instance did cither of them make a
distinct impression, the fault, of
course, being Cue more to the defects
of th~ ;.;:rt.s assigned them than to
anything else.
The audience did its best to be en
thusiastic, but failed to get further
than to make one perfunctory curtain
call. The evening will doubtless be re
membered as a brilliant effort on the
part of a great actor to so rouse the
imagination of a large audience asto
make everyone of them form some In
telligent conception of the inner mean
ing ar.d mural of StevensonÂ»3 story, but
the effort failed. It was a fine piece of
acting, but it is probable that very few
of the audience would ask to see it
again if they had a choice of seeing
>fr. Mansfield in any other role with
which his name is associated.
The play founded upon Robert Louis
Stevenson's story, "Dr. Jekyll and Mr.
Hydf," is not likely to be counted even
by the most ardent of its admirers as a
permanent contribution to the Ameri
can and British stage. It has been
played in this, city sufficiently often to
deprive it of all the attraction it once
had as a novelty. The large audience
:hm assembled to see Mr. Mansfield's
performance of it last evening was
therefore animated Trore by a desire to
see what a master actor could make of
it than to . see the play itself. That
they had such enjoyment as could be

Forty-nine players entered the San

the drawing for which was held at the
California Tennis Club, last night. The
good players are distributed through
out and will not meet in the opening
rounds. In the upper half Percy Mur
dock, Dr. McChesney and Merle John-
Eon are probably the best players.
There are more good players in the
lower half. Besides Baker. Allen and
Mitchell there are many but little be
hind them in point of skill.
The drawing resulted as follows:
First round (lower half) â Crawford a bye,
KImball vs. Dunlap. Drolla vs. H. Long, Mit

ford and Washington will send crews
to this bay next spring for an inter
collegiate contest. Though the repre
sentatives of Stanford University did
not do much this yc^r. they feel con
fident that more practice will improve
their crews greatly. If Stanford Uni
versity Bhould fail to send a crew in
for next year's intercollegiate event,
the Berkeley crew will go to Lake
Washington. Seattle, and will engage
in their third contest against thejUnl
versity of Washington. A handsome
silver loving cup has been offered to
the university crew that first succeeds
in winning three consecutive races.

With the limited number of rinks
at their disposal In Golden Gate Park
the Scottish Bowlers are having some
difficulty in running off their two tourn
aments. The doubles event is more
than half finished and the absence of
two of the players and the consequent
withdrawal of their teams will make
it possible to finish this event several
weeks earlier than the schedule calls
for. The first round closed last Sut
urday. As neither Charles Adams and
James Gray nor E. J. Clinton and A.
A. McVicar appeared, both teams lost
by default. This puts James Mearns
and Thomas McXaught in the semi
final round. They beat Miller and Pat
terson In the first round. A. Foreman
and J. C. Moffatt, who reached the
second round, will default to Dr. Ham
ilton and W. R. Eaton. The latter will
thereby gain a place in the semi-fin
als, where they will meet Mearns and
McNaught. "v..
In the upper half four teams are
left. Alex Hay and A. McNalr will
meet J. M. Duncan and M. L. Crowe,
and J. Stott and J. McLaren will be
opposed to J. S. Webster and G. C.
Patterson. Mr. McLaren will leave
next week for Scotland and it is ex
pected his match will be played to
day.
Since Foreman and Moffatt have
withdrawn many are of the opinion
that Dr. Hamilton and W. R. Eaton
will carry off the honors. They did
some great bowling when they met
Y. C. Lawson and A. Craig in the^ first
round.
But little progress ha3 been mad?
in the singles. Only four matches have
been completed In the preliminary
round. This leaves twenty matches to
be played to-day,

The Golden Gate Park Driving As

fit of the athletic amphitheater to be
built in Golden Gate Park and will
hold an interesting harness matinee at
Ingleside track next Monday after
noon. After deducting a few minor
expenses the proceeds will be devoted
to the fund now being raised by the
Amateur Driving and Athletic Associa
tion for the building of the amphithe

bicycles and foot racers and the big
oval field for other outdoor sports re
quiring a large area. All the gate
money and coin realized from the sale
of the betting privileges r.ill be turn

than Si 000 will go to the fund. En
tries for the races, which include a
three-furlong dash for thoroughbreds
and a novel handicap for trotters and
pacers, have already been published
In these columns. The last named
event will be open for entries up to
the time of starting the first race on
Monday.

HORSEMEN EXTEND HELPING
HAXD TO AMATEUR ATHLETES
The manner of Champion Jim Jef
fries' training at Harbin Springs
should be an object lession not alone
to fighters, but to all amateur ath
letes, who are invariably overtrained.
Jeffries has learned the great lesson
that health and condition are synony
mous terms and ho gains the latter
while striving for the former.
He lives out of doors and his rifle
and fishing rod are constantly in use.
He drives long distances to famous
streams and then spends hours whip
ping them for trout. On other occa
sions he takes his rifle, in the use of
which he is an adeot, and climbs
precipitous cliffs in search 'of game.
This builds up a tremendous store of
vitality which makes him so formid
able a fighting machine in the ring.
He does not neglect his boxing, do
ing enough of this to "true up" his
eyes and to bring the special muscles
required at this game into play.
.Jeffries weighs. 238 pounds at pres
ent, but as the weather is warm
he will soon get rid of some
of this bulk.' He will probably fight
heavier than ever before, but will
be trained to the hour when he steps
into the ring with Munroe. Billy De
laney is watching his 'work closely,
and, as both expect to retire after this
they are taking no chances of
their brilliant records as fighter and
trainer being marred by a defeat.
El Campo will be the scene of the
first contest of the oarsmen of two
clubs during the present season. One
of the items of the programme to be
given at that bay resort on June 12
Is a boat race in which two barge crews
from the Ariel Rowing Club and two
from the South End Rowing Club will
take part. The Ariel Club is manifest
ing great activity, a large number of
members being at the.boathouse on all
Sundays and holidays. The boats are
being put into commission and crews
will be formed for the regatta to be
held on July 4.
President W. B. Hlnchman of the
Paclilc Association of the Amateur
Athletic Union has. nominated the fol
lowing as the Fourth of July regatta
committee: W. B. Hinchman of the
Alameda Boating Club, E. J. Lynch of
the Ariel Rowing Club, A. P. Rothkopf
of the Dolphin Boating Club, D. E.
Brcwn of the Olympic Boat Club, M. J.
Calnan of the Pioneer Rowing Club, T.
I. Fltzpatrick of the South End Row
ing Club (chairman), and Herbert Hau
ser of the rowing annex of the Stock
ton Athletic Association.
The regatta will be held on Lake
Merritt on July 4 and will be tl.e cham
plQnshlp event of the year. Crews
from all the clubs named, except pos
sibly the Pioneer Rowing Club, will
take part. The Dolphin Boating Club,
being equipped for the first time with a
modern, light racing barge, will try
hard for first . place In one or more of
the barge classes. The famous "Spi
ders," who held the championship for
the Alameda Boating Club for several
years, have, parted company, but a
strong crew will be made up of new
men. The crew which wins first place
In the senior barge race will have the
chance #f representing San Francisco
at the "regatta to be held at Portland,
Or., next year.
E. A. Bannister has been elected cap
tain .of the rowing crew of the Uni
versity of California for next season to
succeed S. Bunnell, who has graduated.
The cockswain, Joseph P. Loeb, and the
other two oarsmen, G. J. Anloff, who
rowed No. 2, and E. J. Grlndley, who
pulled the bow oar, will be available
next season. Bunnell's place at stroke
may^be taken by H. W. Schreiber, who
was stroke : of this year's freshman
crew.. Other oarsmen, one or more of
â¢whom " may fill seats in '. the university
four, are: H. W. Ross. '06; H. W. Car
penter,.'06; A. Salisbury, '07, and G. C.
Jones, '07. .
. It is hoped the universities of Stan-
Cricketers of this city and of its en
virons will have a busy time during the
holidays. To-day, to-morrow and on
Monday there will be matches between
the city teams and a visiting eleven of
the Santa Cruz Cricket and Athletic
Club on the ground at Webster street,
Alameda. The Santa Cruz eleven plays
against the San Francisco County team
to-day. The Santa Cruz team is made
up of H. H. Davis (captain), E. F. Hil
ton, Stephen Stagg. E. H. Day, A. Mc-
Namara, W. Howard, A. Jenkins, J.
Richardson, S. F. Catling, A. Neville
and Bruce Sharpe.
The San Francisco County eleven will
be chosen from H. B. Richardson (cap
tain), B. Kortlang, E. G. Sloman, E. J.
Stratton, T. J. A. Tiedemann, H. Rob
erts, C. W. Irish, W. R. Stewart, R. S.
Weaver, H. K. Boulton and T. J. A.
Tiedemann Jr. The team will be de
prived of the services of E. Petersen,
as he broke his arm in the lacrosse
match played last Sunday between All
San Francisco and the San, Mateo
twelve.
To-morrow the Santa Cruz visitors
will play the Pacific eleven, which will
consist of H. D. Bowly, E. H. M. Lan
nowe, W.*Petherick, A. W. Wilding, Dr.
O. N. Taylor, J. W. Myers (captain),
Norman Logan, D. Jamieyon, E. H.
Wilkes and H..C. Casidy. This is the
first match In which E. H. Wilkes and
D. Jamieson have played during the
present season. Wilkes was a member
of the San Francisco County team last
year, and. In conjunction with Kort
lang, bowled consistently well all
through the season. It Is expected he
will lend much strength to the Pacific
attack.
On Decoration day the Santa Cruz
team will play its third match in suc
cession, its opponents being the Ala
meda eleven, selected from F. JV_Croll,
G. H. Ward, George Carroll, F. A.

CHAMPION HOUNDS
ARE IN TRAINING
The third annual tennis tournament
for the championship of San Francisco
will be played 6n the California Club
courts to-morrow and Monday. The
winner of the tournament will meet J.
Drummond MacGavln, the present
champion, in the college match. The
first tournament was won by George F.
Whitney, the second by Grant M. Smith
and the third by Drummond MacGavin.
In the absence of a championship cup
Whitney and Smith were compelled to
play throughout the tournament. Last
year a cup was presented by Joseph D.
Grant, and In future the champion will
not be called upon to play in the tour
nament.
The best fifty players from both sides
of the bay have entered, and some in
teresting matches will result. Most of
the entries are from San Francisco, be
ing sent in from the California and the
Golden Gate clubs. The largest number
of entries are from the park, twenty
three of the public court cracks hav
ing subscribed their names to the en
try list.
Probably the strongest player in the
tournament is Percy Murdock of Ala
meda. At his best he would have no
difficulty in winning, but he is erratic
on the courts and cannot be relied
upon. Of the players from this side of
the bay Will Allen, Frank Mitchell
and George Baker are undoubtedly the
best. Allen and Mitchell are from the
California Club. Allen is in poor form
and of late has been playing a miser
able game. Although he beat Mac-
Gavin at the park two weeks ago, he
was on the same day badly beaten by
Baker.
Mitchell plays a clever game at times.
If he meets Allen, Baker or Murdock
in one of the early rounds he may beat
them, but he can hardly last through
a tournament of this size.
While Baker, Murdock, Allen and
Mitchell are figured as the class of the
event, there are several players who
may surprise the talent- Herbert
Schmidt of the California Club and
Clarence Griffin of the Golden Gate
Club are clever players and should
work well into the tournament. Men
like Dunlai>. Crawford. Cornell, Long
and C. Smith may also make some of
the cracks extend themselves.
Play will begin promptly at 10 o'clock
to-morrow morning. AH matches ex
cept finals and challenge match will be
two sets out of three; finals and chal
lenge to bo three out of five. A lunch
eon will be served to players and
guests. The tournament will be held
under the Joint auspices of the Cali
fornia and Golden Gate tennis clubs.
Four prizes will be offered besides the
Grand challenge cup. Those reaching
the semi-finals will receive prizes.
Gross Scores Will Count as
Qualifying Hounds in Con
tests for Council's Cup
There will be a handicap competition
over eighteen holes for men and a sim
ilar contest over nine holes for women
on the links of the San Rafael Golf
Club to-day. The members of the San
Francisco Golf Club have been in
vited to take part in these events. The
first eight gross scores among the men
will qualify for the competition for the
Council's cup for men and the lowest
eight scores among the ladies will qual
ify for the contest for the Council's cup
for women.
On Decoration day in the morning the
first round at match play in the com
petitions for the Council's cup will take
place, and in the afternoon* the second
or semi-final rounds will be played.
The final rounds in bo*:i competitions
will be held on Saturday, June 4.
Though work has been begun on the
new course of the San Francisco Golf
Club at Ingleside, it is not likely that
much will be done during the dry sea
son. The San Francisco Golf Club has
been incorporated, the directors being
Captain J. S. Oyster, president; H. M.
Hoy t, Dr. J. R. Clark, R. J. Woods and
R. D. Girvin.
On Decoration day there will be a
handicap over 36 holes for the members
of the Oakland Golf Club on the Point
Adams course, which is still used
pending the completion of the new
Country Club links. The house of the
Country Club is finished and presents a
handsome external appearance. It is
surrounded by well laid-out grounds.
In the competition for the amateur
golf championship of Great Britain no
one is eligible who has ever made for
sale clubs, balls or other articles con
nected with the game. There are some
who think this regulation unsatisfac
tory. It is said that a man of humble
origin might, through industry and
aptitude for business, come to be the
head of a great firm, might become
wealthy, be elected to the House of
Commons and occupy a good social po
sition; yet, under the present rules, if
it could be shown he had ever made a
ball or club for sale, he would be class
ed as a professional, or at least not re
garded as a bona-fide amateur. Some
times, too, gentlemen by birlh and edu
cation, may avail themselves qf their
skill in golf to increase small incomes
by methods that affect their amateur
standing. Afterward their fortunes
may improve or they may even attain
distinction; yet they are barred forever
from taking part in open amateur com
petitions.
Some people suggest that -'1 distinc
tion be abolished, amateurs and pro
fessionals meeting on equal terms. In
Great Britain this is regarded as im
practicable. The professionals would
not view the proposal favorably arid it
is said to be "impossible even to con
ceive the idea of gentlemen competing
with professionals for money prizes,
which is the logical outcome of the
lde-a." It is thought the delegates who
have the championship arrangements
in charge or the committee of the club
on whose links it is played ought to
have the power to reinstate suitable
persons who have loet their amateur
standing.

Several boats of the San Francisco
Yacht Club fleet will leave their Sausa

placed in the race on Sunday, the 6th
inst., contending for the two trophies
that were not awarded on that occa
eion. The yachts are the yawl Witch,
the sloops Annie and Surprise and the
echooner Martha. The first and second
cups were won by the sloops Alice and
Challenger.
To-day and to-morrow are open dates
on the schedule of the Corinthian Yacht
Club and will be spent by many of the
yachtsmen in preparing their boats for
the annual regatta, that takes place on
Ijecoration day. Several of the pleasure
craft thÂ«t do not take part in the re
gatta will be used on a three days'
cruise to Benicia, Vallejo and other
places.
The fleet of the California Yacht Club

San Francisco set down in its schedule.
A start will be made from its headquar
ter? at Alviso to-morrow morning at 1

ty, the length of which is about six
miles. After the races the fleet of the
Oakland Canoe Club will remain at
the headquarters of the Encinal Yacht
Club during the week, returning to
Sessions Basin on Sunday, June 5.
The annual regatta of the Cor
inthian Yacht Club on Decoration day
will be more than usually interesting,
as the number of entries is larger
than in last year's event. In several
of 'the classes there are new boats,
whose sjieed and abilities are not yet
known. In the twenty-foot class the
Vixen and the Ruby are new com
j>etitors and will make a keen contest.
In the yawl class last year there were
only three entries, but this year there
are seven, the additional entries being
the yawls Bprajr, El Revo and Aca
j>ulco, and the new schooner, Lady
Ada, launched a few weeks ago from
Stone's yard. In the twenty-five-foot
class the sloops Dixie and Hiawatha
r.re new entries, the class also includ
ing the speedy craft Discovery, Ruby,
Merope and Neva. In the thirty-foot
class sire included the well-known rac
ing craft Aeolus. Amigo, Truant and
also the enlarged and improved
Presto. The new sloop Corinthian will
rot take part in any race until the
contest "for the Perpetual Challenge
cup. In the thirty-six-foot class there
-fire no new boats, but the sloop Har
,poon and the old rivals, Emma, Edna
end Thclma, will not fail to keep the
spectators interested. In class I, in
cluding all yachts having a racing
length of more than thirty-six feet, a
close struggle is expected between
Commodore Jennings' Speedwell and
F. G. Berry's Nixie. The latter is sail-
Ing remarkably well this season, while
the Speedwell is always in good trim
and excellently handled by "Koko"
Howard. The Clara, Mischief and
Hover are also entered in this class,
but the real contest will be between
the craft owned by the commodores
of the Corinthian and Fresno yacht
clubs.

Illinois Wise, the negro, was- for
merly cook on a schoner that plies be
tween here and Honolulu. He was at
tracted by the little Kanaka. and per
suaded her mother to let him adopt
the child and bring her to this country
to be educated. Once away from the
mother he told the girl that she. must
become his consort. She refused and
was protected by the ship's sailors.
When the vessel arrived at San
Francisco Wise attempted to take his
charge to a disreputable lodging
house, but she objected, and was final
ly taken to the house of Mrs. Haynes
at 915 Powell street. There her plight
was made known to. Secretary White
of the Children's Society and he at
once took charge of her,
Wise strenuously objected to Inter
ference and showed some purported
adoption papers in Judge Murasky's
court' to sustain his claim. It was
shown that Wise had served ten years
in Folsom for killing a Chinaman and
Judge Murasky at once awarded the
custody of the little gh-1 to White.
Rose Lindsey, a half-breed Kanaka,
was rescued from the clutches of the
Jamaica negro by officers of the So
ciety for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Children last Wednesday and yester
day Judge Murasky ordered that she
be placed in a charitable Institution.
The girl is only 13 years of age.

CHICAGO, May 27.â Frankie Nell.
thej famous little Callfornian boxer,
demonstrated his right to the title of
world's bantam-weight champion to
night by knocking out Tommy Moore
In less than one round at Battery D
Armory. The deciding punch was a
terrific lefthand hook to the stomach
that doubled Moore Into a fantastic
muscular knot and left him groaning
on the canvas while Referee Abe Pol
lock counted off the fatal seconds.
The fight was purely a question of
class, with Nell holding the upper
hand. Moore rushed from the Jump.
He swung his right hand hard on
Neil's head, they clinched, broke and
clinched again and they wrestled
across the ring. Neil landing a hard
left to the stomach. Th^ pace was fast,
Moore getting home twice with right
and left to the jaw, but always too
high to do any serious damage.
Suddenly Neil ripped an awful left to
Moore's stomach The Chicago lad
reeled to the ropes and Neil sprang
upon him like a tiger. Three times that
murderous left sank into Moore's mid
riff and the local boy dropped to hia
knees, groaning. He was up at the
count of eight and made a desperate
rally, but his strength had deserted
him. His lips were white with the
whiteness of death. Heavily his arms
swung to and fro in vain attempts to
reach his enemy's jaw.
On came Nell, remorseless, the light
of victory in his eyes. Once again that
deadly left sunk Into Moore's stomach.
The Chicagoan fell forward, his chin
striking the padded floor. He was
counted out and did not come to for
some time.

* It must be a source of much satis
faction to Mr. "Ham" Iberg to treat
his. former teammates and the man
ager who discarded him to a double
blank in one week. Aside from any
personal grudge which < "Ham" ! may
have settled, he achieved a brilliant
victory and deserves all the credit that
may be coming. Score, San Francisco
0, Portland 5.
"Ham's" old time running mate,
Jimmy Whalen, came in for a beating
at the hands of the men garbed in
brown. His shoots never looked as
easy as^ they did yesterday and al
though he was there with the control
and the curves^ the Brownies were able
to land freely on the leather.
Errors figured quite prominently in
the accumulation c-f tallies during a
hot mixup in the"second round. It was
opened by Francis with # a clean cut
two-bagger out to deep left. Murphy
followed with one of the same stripe
to the opposite field and the firs^ run
was a- reality. Steelman sent Murphy
to third on an infield out and Shea
,forced him at the plate by hitting to
Anderson, who returned the ball in
lightning style and executed a grand
play that started the bleachers cheer-
Ing.
The -fast work did not prevent more
runs. Iberg was safe on Massey's
error and Shea traveled as far as third.
Drennan pounded the ball to left and
scored Shea. Ibergistarted for third
and Hildebrand did<Â«iejioot stunt with
the ball. 'Hfe then threw low to Irwin
and Iberg scampered for the pan. Ir
win's throw was wide, so it was not
difficult for the Portland Blabster to
get in with the third run.''
The other two for Portland came
easily, aided by timely hitting in the
fifth and* eighth rounds.
In the second. inning Gorton was in
jured by- J^urphy, -^who 'came rushing
headlorfgf^nto'' hlmiatnthe- plate. Gor
ton was' badly shaken up, but tried to
get -back Jnto the game. "His sight
seemed impaired and he was forced to
seek the bench. Leahy went in to
work, although suffering from a bad
finger. -The score:

CHICAGO. May 27.â Not an accident
occurred in the steeplechase, one of the
features of to-day's card at Haw
thorne. Not one of the field of six
horses made a blunder and the entire
field raced well bunched throughout the
short course. First, one, then another,
would take the lead until nearing the
final obstacle, where Itacatiara, backed
from 6 to 1 to 11 to 2, moved up and
after leaping the final fence went to
the front and won as he pleased.
Potheen, backed from 2 to 1 to 3 to 2,
had a cake walk in the third race, at
the Derby distance of a mile and a
half, winning easily from Lacy Craw
ford, which had no trouble, in getting
the place.
The track was good, the weather
clear and warm and the attendance
large. Summaries:

The San Francisco Model Tacht
Club will hold Its first regatta of the
year on Spreckels Lake, Golden Gate
Park, on Monday. A silver cup has
been offered by the directors of the
club for a race between sloops meas
uring from forty-two to fifty Inches
inclusive. The first trial race will be
called at 1 o'clock. As all of the larg
est and fastest boats in the club fig
ure in this class there will be some flg
teresting races. The following boats
have been entered: H. London's Imp.
J. Brarinon's Sophie, William Roeck
ner's Apache, O.. Forrest's Piute, J. P.
Daisley'3 Isabelle, O. Nelson's Alba
tross, G. Hay's Amelia, 'B. Jurgens*
Zampa, Todd & Adams' Santee, Col

dred, T. M. Burthout's Ethel. E. P.
Leslie's - Humboldt, G. W. Erwin'*
Mermaid, M. Clawson's Roma and F.
J. McCleary's unnamed sloop.
A committee composed of G. II.
Todd. L. S. Adams, J. D. Dalsley and
H. London has been apopinted to
wait upon tl\e Park Commissioners at
their next meeting with a view to get
ting a clubhouse built on the banks of
the lake. The necessity of such a
building was shown last Sunday, when
Collier Bros, were relieved of an ex
tra set of sails by some boys.'
Three new boats have been built
by the members of the HumboldC
Evening School. The students hav*
built them under the direction of E.
P. Leslie, teacher of draughting and
a prominent member of the San Fran
cisco Model Yacht Club. The boats
are called the Humboldt I, II and III.
Many Fast Miniature Boats Will Com
pete for Handsome Silver Cup
on Decoration Day.
SAILORS OF MODEL, YACHTS
READY FOR THEIR REGATTA
For instance. Peter Lohman should
be dickering with an outfielder who can
wallop the ball. He wants such a man.
and wants him badly. Then another
pitcher would look good on Peter's
staff. He was lucky in grabbing Jimmy
Byrnes In his hour of need, for sinc^
joining the team. Jimmy has saved
many a game for the Commuters.
Morley is better off in the way of
talent than any of the others who count
on winning the pennant. He Is pos
sessed of a good pitching staff and- an
outfield that figures to hit well, but is
still on the waiting list. Then he has &
fine utility man in Wheeler. If the
champions could only strike their bat
ting gait they would surely be win
ning more games. So far their hitting
has been woefully weak.
"The young pitchers on the Tacoma
team are beginning to get theirs from
the artful club swingers on the Seattle
team. Mike Fisher's outfielders are not
meeting the ball any too regularly. All
the heavy stick work Is being done by
the inflelders. The way they have been
batting is out of the ordinary, and It is
out of the question to expect these men
to keep up their present clip much
longer.
Seattle Is coming with a rush, and
the predictions of the knowing ones
who touted the Slwashes as headliners
may make good. Their pitching staff is
crippled, but at that Williams, Hall and
Barber have been doing great things
In the box. But. then, when a team
hits the ball like Wilson's crowd a
pitcher does not have to work so hard.
It is a cinch the opposing clubs will
always have to make a good many
runs before they can claim victory over
Seattle.
Overall has been the only winning
pitcher on the Tacoma staff in the last
series with Seattle.
The baseball fans are making bets
as to which team will hold the lead la.
the Pacific Caast League pennant race
for more than a day at a time. No nine
lnthe league has a license to accom
plish this feat, and judging by the way
the first four are bunched there will be
no leader at all within uN* next two
weeks.
Now that the race has become so In
teresting many of the managers seem
to forget that they will have t<
strengthen some in order to keep in tin
going. *There ia hardly a team in tlu
league that does not want one or more
good men. Of course, it will be a hard
task to dig up just such material, but
it will have to come sooner or later.

PROF. LIVINGSTONE'S readings are like
a living page of Flammarion's treatise that Is
so electrifying- the world to-day. He Is no
imitator. His work Is upon original lines,
pure thought, clear vision. He tells you what
you desire to know and works in the -open
light.
He Is as conspicuous for his wonderful oc-
cult analysis as he is for his original ex-
pression and vivid truthfulness.
A test reading Is not a life reading. "When
you call on PROF. LIVINGSTONE he will
give you a full life reading for $1. A test is
of little value; when the mind Is troubled you
need more substantial aid and advice. This
Is Just what PROF. LIVINGSTONE gives
you when you call on him for a nrst-class
cliirvoyant reading.
He asks you no questions, but tells you
what you wish to know. â¢
He does not mention all the Ills and mis-
fortunes you are heir to. You are acquainted
with the facts in . your case. Let PROF.
LIVINGSTONE analyze the matters that are
troubling you. find the .cause of trouble and
suggest the remedy.

court decided In favor of plaintiffs, but the
decision -was reversed by the Supreme Court
of South Dakota. The case being carried to
the Supreme Court of the United States the
Judgment of the State Supreme Court was sus
tained. The fact that a tender was made In
settlement after beins dispossessed of their
Interest by legal process was given no con
sideration, and the claim of plaintiffs that no
names were mentioned In the publication of
the notice was declared by the court to have
no force and that the names of the heirs
Â¦were not necessary. The notice was addressed
to "Kufus Wllsey, his heirs, administrators
and to whom It may concern." The claim
of plaintiff that at the time of publication of
the notice there was no administrator of the
estate, the former administrator having died
and his Aucces*or not having been appointed,
was equally unavailing.

,On the other hand, Mr. Dillman of
the Sacramento Board of Supervisors,
who went with a committee to visit
the scene of dredging operations near
Oroville, says in an interview that is
published in the Bee:
The committee went Into the situation quite
thoroughly, continued Mr. Dillman, not only
at the point of dredge operations, but also
above and below â above where no dredging
has beeh carried on, and below, where the
sand deposits' exist. It was evident to the
committee, and I think an examination will
convince any unprejudiced person, that the de
posits complained of by the farmers are iden
tical In character with the material dis
lodged by the dredges, and not with the
ground farther up, above Oroville. where
there are no boats In operation. The com-
Some striking statements are made
by the statistician in an interview pub
lished in the Sacramento Bee. He
said:
Dredge mining la one of the greatest and
most striking triumphs of human Ingenuity In
the application of machinery. A miner work
ing with pick and shovel, and washing the
material In any of the old ways by hand, dis
poser of two and a half cubic yards a day.
One of thg dredgers lifts and washes 1000
times as much in twenty-four hours, or 2300
cubic yards. The dredgers run night and
day, three shifts of men being employed, each
working eizht hours. I am Informed that
the average yield of the gravel dredged at
Oroville Is about 27 cents per cubic yard, and
the cost of working It is given as 7 cents per
yard. This allows of a profit of many thou
sands of dollars per acre. As high as $2300
an acre has been paid for good dredge min
ing ground.
A singular Instance Is related at Oroville
of a man who had an orange orchard of
twelve acres, which he had advertised for
sale at ?100 an acre. He found the land was
valuable for dredging purposes, and raised
his price to $2000 an acre, which was recently
paid by a dredge mining company that bought
the orchard. The difference between the old
price and the new was Just J22.800. An
olive orchard, which was unprofitable, -was
also sold for like hlth figures. I pee no rea
pon why such conversion of land to more
profitable uses should be deplored by any
body. Certainly the owners of those orchards
would never have got from the products of
the trees In a lifetime as much profit as they
realized from the sale of the land for min
ing purposes, and the dredge owners will
make a handsome profit.
VIEWS OP DUiKVfAN".
Some figures submitted are of inter
est. It is said that the product of the
gold dfftdjtfra i n tne year 1904 will
probaDrr^^tmount to more than
$1,000,000.' In three years the an
nual output of the dredgers will exceed
in value the fruits of hydraulic and
drift mining combined. The total
value of gold and silver mine<rUn Cali
fornia in 1902, the last year for which
complete statistics are available, was
517,526,732. The quartz mines yielded
$13,000,000 in round figures, the drift
mines 5900,000, the hydraulic mines
51.280,000, the dredgers 5801,000.
Probably the product of the gold
dredging in 1903 was double that of
1902. This Conclusion is arrived at
after considering the increased num
ber of dredgers and their augmented
capacity.
Dredger mining is still the leading
topic of the mining men in California-
Charles G. Tale, a member of the
executive committee of the California
Miners' Association and the Statisti
cian of the United States Mint in this
city and also of the California State
Mining Bureau, goes on record as say
ing that the dredgers are doing no
harm.
There are only seven mining dredg
ers that are operating in the bed of
or along the river near Oroville. A
score are away from the river. The
score, raise material and drop it where
it cannot reach the river, so says Mr.
Yale. The dredgers that are operating
on the river bank turn over, and de
posit gravel. Above this they % place
cobbles and bowlders, keeping trr^flner
material down and anchoring it more
securely than If the dredgers had not
handled it.
If the dredgers are found to be do-
Ing any damage they can easily be
walled in and so made harmless by
causing all the material that has been
dredged to be replaced on the spot
from which it was raised. The floods
of the last season, also says Mr.
Yale, brought down a large quantity of
sand and other material from above
Oroville. New deposits of white sand
above Oroville have been observed
above the scene of the operations of
the dredgers. The sand was of the
sort that has recently been complained
of by property-owners along the river
banks, who attributed it to the dredg
ers. Mr. Yale is convinced that the
owners of the old dredgerB desire to
give no offence and will certainly do
all in their power to prevent damage
to any one.
EXTENT OF INDUSTRY.
An interesting decision has been
made br the Supreme' .Court of the
United States relative to the failure of
copartners to contribute their propor
tion of assessment work, which Is re
viewed, by the Mining and Scientific
Press, as follows: Â¦
The case was that of "W. S. Elder, ad
ministrator of the estate of R. . TVilsey et al
vs. Horseshoe Mining Company et al. of South'
Dakota.'.. Wllsey ' and .one C. H. Havens lo
cated a claim in" the Bald Mountain district
seven miles south of Deadwood, S. D., In 1S7S.
Shortly thereafter Wllsey died, but 'Havens
continued, to do assessment work for . eight
years, when he served notice on the heirs of
Wllsey demanding their share of the expenses
in performing the work â $400. They paid
nothing' and neglected to take advantage of
this opportunity to secure their original half
interest in the property, and subsequently. In
188Â», Havens , advertised them out. Later,
methods of successfully treating the telluride
ores of that section having been discovered the
claim increased rapidly In value. In Decem
bers 1903, the helra of Wllsey offered to pay
their share of annual assessment from tho
date of location of the claim,' which offer was
refused. Havens then sold the property and
the heirs of Wllsey sued for an undivided
one-half Interest In the claim. - The district
The Bangor Consolidated Gravel
Company has been incorporated to ope
rate in Butte County, about thirteen
miles from Oroville. Those concerned
in the scheme say that a tunnel three
miles long will be necessary and that
operations will be on a large scale.
IMPORTANT DECISION'.
Portland people believe that there
will be attracted to their. home city be
tween 4000 and 5000 visitors by the
American Mining Congress, to be held
in August. This will be the seventh
annual congress.
The Alleghany Mining Company has
bought the Telegraph mining claim in
Nevada County, from Bovee and King.
According to the Mother Lode Ban
ner, deals for mining properties in Tu
olumne County have been made as fol
lows:
A. C. Johnnon of Carters has sold to H. M.
Hall of Madera a one-half Interest In the
Mohican quartz mine, near Carters. C. A.
Holland and others have sold to W. T. Carter
the New Era, Chilcoot Pass and Plateau
quartz mines and a right to 600 Inches of the
water of Hunter Creek. The deed to the Rhoda
Island, Eureka and Mississippi quartz claims
from Sylvester Carton, aa administrator of
the estate of J. F. Callahan, deceased, to the
Santa Ana Manufacturing Company has been
filed. *- Â¦ .
The Calaveras Chronicle reports the
bonding of the Ready Bullion and Riv
erside mines, on the South Fork of the
Tuolumne River, near Railroad Flat,*
by C. W. Hlggins.
The Three Stars mine in Placer
County, at Ophir, is reported to be
working sixty men and to be crushing
ninety tons of ore per day.
A new company has bought and will
operate the East Orleans mine, on Gold
Flat, Nevada County. J. C. Campbell,
superintendent of the Mountaineer
mine, at Nevada City, is at the head of
the enterprise.'
At the Oneida mine, near Jackson,
Amador County, 130 men are employed
and the sixty-stamp mill is kept run
ning steadily. At the Kennedy mine
the forty-stamp mill will be taken
down and added to the sixty-stamp
mill, making 100 stamps to be operated
on the mine.
The Calaveras Prospect says regard
ing the shutting down of 'the Red Gold,
near Murphys:
The Red Gold mine near Murphys Is shut
down, ostensibly at first through an over
abundance cf water In the shaft and levels.
Later developments would warrant the as
sumption that financial troubles are the real
cause. Mr. Stone, the local superintendent, be
lieves that everything will soon be satisfactor
ily adjusted and work resumed, i
Operations will soon begin at the
Black Oak mine, in Calaveras County.
A traction road between Ivanpah and
the borax mines of the 'Pacific Coast
Borax Company, in Inyo County, has
been completed.
It is reported that work will be re
sumed on the Kensington mining prop
erty at Berners Bay, Alaska, by virtue
of an agreement reached by the man
agement of the Treadwell- mines and
the Nowells.
VARIOUS OPERATIONS.
The lack of sufficient fall has prevented thÂ«
extensive opening of these mines by the hy
draulic process, and the same reason has pre
vented their drainage without long and expen
sive tunnels. In many places the higher chan
nels have been worked and millions of dollars
have been taken out. but the deep channels In
the vicinity of San Andreas, along Central Hill
and in other localities have proved a too ex
pensive proposition to be profitably handled.
In addition to being so low that they could
not be drained, most of the gravel Is a hard
cement that is not easily washed, and must
either He exposed to the air for a year before
watshlng or else be run through a mill before
yielding up its treasure. The delay for the
purpose of letting the gravel Black is not profit
able, as It means the tying up of capital, which
cannot be well afforded, and the mill process
has proved expensive and unsatisfactory.
Continuous prospecting and exploration has
pretty well defined these gravel channels, bo
that the course of the buried rivers and their
numerous branches is well determined. Within
a few years there has been great Improvement
in the construction of gravel mills, and. best
of all. in the facilities for handling water. It
has now become possible to handle the water In
these deep channels by pumping without the
great expense heretofore Involved, and the
gravel mill of to-day can easily and economi
cally handle the deposits from the mines.
Several mines have been opened along the
channel In the vicinity of San Andreas recent
ly, and have demonstrated that not only can
the water be handled with ease and economy,
but that there is a vast amount of gold In the
gravel awaiting the investor of capital. Along
tho old channel from Calaveritas to Central
Hill there are numerous mines, all of which
have been more or less explored In years past,
that will doubtless socn be In operation, now
that it has been demonstrated that the water
can be handled and the gravel milled at small
expense.
It Is well known that along the trend of the
mother lode In this county are numerous buried
rivers, rich In auriferous gravel, but for several
reasons these deep channels have never been
profitably worked on any large scale.
An era* of gravel" mining in Cala
veras County is dawning, so says the
Calaveras Prospect:
GRAVEL IX CAL.AVERAS.
H. E. Picket was an arrival on last even-
Ing's train. Mr. Picket- Is stopping near Fol
eom and for the last four weeks has been su
perintending the prospecting with Keystone
drills of a tract of land that he contemplates
mining by dredger process. Prospecting will
also begin to-day on a tract of land neat the
river at Coloma that Mr. Picket has under bond
and should results prove favorable a dredger
will be put to work on the ground. The pros
pects of El Dorado having a hand In dredge
mining eeem bright at the present time. The
San Francteco people who recently bonded the
Williamson place on Webber Creek at Qay
lords Bridge have Inspected the tract and are
making preparations to install a number of
Keystone drills to prospect the ground. There
are about 135 acre* In the trac f - and thm (travel

According to the Placerville Nugget,
prospecting for gold dredger' mining In
El Dorado County is progressing. In
substance the Nugget says:
mlttee. aa I havÂ« gala, visited all three;
points, and Boon satisfied Itself that the sand
on the farms came from the dredger fields.
It Is the same class of material In which
the boats are working, and not the sains aa
higher up and which some of the miners have
said was washed down upon the lowlands.
They also have Bald that the question at Issue
was one of fact, capable of demonstration.
I acre* with them. Anyone who will exam
ine the situation honestly can easily satisfy
himself of the fact that the deposits on the
farming lands came from sand sent down the
river by the boats.

A circular of the Schultz-Hansen Company
places tho stocks of Beans In California on
May 20, 1004. at 30S.400 bags, distributed as
follows: Northern and central counties, 34,500
bags; San Francisco. 78.900 baes; southern
counties. 105.000 bags. These stocks consist
of 130,000 bacs LImas, 00.000 large and small
Whites, 35.000 bags Bayos, JJ0.500 bags Black
eyes. 17,500 bags Pinks and 5000 bags miscel
laneous. The circular says: "The stocks now
on hand are 100,000 sacks less than they were
about a year ago, while prices are- now 10 to
25 per cent leRs than In May, 1003. During
January. February and March. 1904. the ship
ments of Ltrnas amounted to 175.C0O Backs,
while during the same time In 1903 only 20.000
sacks were shipped. At this ratio of shipment
the Lima Bean trade of the crop of lÂ»04 will
open on a comparatively barren market."
Many points. on the Atlantic seaboard are now
using California colored Beans. This has only
been within the paÂ«t year or so. Heretofore
the trado for colored Beans has been confined
to the Pacific, Gulf States and Territories, but
this year the demand has" been so large that
stocks of Pinks are now the lightest In yeara,
and according to estimates, -are- not larg
enough to supply the ordinary Pacific Coast
trade until arrival of new crop, about Octo
ber IS. . In the northern counties much of the
Bean land Is under water (due to recent floods)
and a large amount of the B?an land has been
seeded to potatoes. The high price - of â¢ pota
toes has been the incentive . to seed) potatoes
rather than Beans, . . > â¢ Â¦"

toward tower prior**. The market did not quite
rÂ«ach the record for dull net*- touctied en
ilarch !Â». But to-day's total of 119,000 phares
If ft little to ohoost- btintu them. The lmnl
ncace of n three day.-' holiday, added to th<
rÂ»:neral diiscourwrf-inent of the speculation, mu
the cause of the aggrax-afd apathy of the
market. The promise cf a growth in c?*h

*10.Â«>fl0.000 stimulated no Interest lr. etocks.
Of thle amount ti.'- eub-treacury hat contrib- '

pÂ»ld to the bank* test i\erk for the account I
of the Per^ama rr public and Fin'-e depleted by
the recall of Government deposit*. The flood
of currency from the Interior, estimated to
fr.ave smountpd to upward of $6 Cufi.Ouo in

Import on account cf the Inference cf etag
r.ant demand for mon^y in burners. The
amount of gold bare a valla M^ for exr>ort lo
incrrow provtd to be only $550,000, but the
eterlinir excharifir continued strong.

Tlie Â»tock market ha* fallen back Into a
lethargic condition thif werk. Dealing* have '
fallen to nominal proportions and prices have
scarcely f-ilrrrd. Last Saturday's rise on the
loan contraction by the banks did not last
out tfce Â¦day tn Monday, and on Tuesday the
levr-I of l'rlces fÂ»-ll back to about tie level
cf the prtrcdir.g l r ridiy. The rert of the week

London Closing Stocks.
CHICAGO. Mav 27. â A sudden scramble by
short* sent the price of May wheat up 2V4o
Just at the close to-day. The spurt in May
straightened up a drooping general market in
wheat, the July option closing Kc over yes
terday's final quotations. Corn shows a gain
of ?Â»c. Oatg are uff a trifle. Provisions are
practically unchanged.
Under the influence of seasonable weather
and generally encouraging conditions for
growing crops, everywhere, the wheat market
opened easier, the July deln'p'y being down
%c to }ic at SCiic. Extreme' dullness char
acterized trading and had a tendency to de
press prices. On the other hand, cables were
firm and afforded some encouragement to the
bulls. The fact that the majority of ex
changes throughout the country would be
closed to-morrow and Monday greatly Â¦ re
stricted the volume of business. The absence
of contract wheat here as the basis of specu
lative transactions caused the abandonment of
trading in July, as fas as possible, except in
the way of evening up outstanding contracts,
the September, delivery attracting Increased at
tention. A St. Louis trade journal registered a
belief In the continued Improvement crop
conditions, but traders appeared indifferent.
Cash wheat at Minneapolis was weak, and a
report from there stated that all flour mills.
would shut down for a few days. During the'
last half hour the May delivery bfcame quite
active the price advancing sharply on covering
by shurts. Deferred futures benefited by this
activity, the market becoming quite firm.
After selling off to S5T4c, July rallied to SUftc,
closing at the top. May ranged between 8G&C
and flS%c and closed at the high point.
Sentiment ,'n the corn market was quitn
bearish, due to the liberal receipts and to pros
pects of a still heavier movement. July
opened tfOlio lower at 47%@4$c, sold down to
47 ; Sc .ind closed at 47-lic
Oats were quiet, but moved nervously over a
narrow range. Alter opening unchanged to He
lower at 3S%<g:W%c. July ranged between
3S%c and Ss^c. cloglng at-Â«JÂ«q4<a;i.S%c.
. Provisions were strong early. In sympathy
with higher prices at the yards, but the mar
ket became easier on profit-taking, all of the
gain being lo?t. July pork closed 2%c lower:
July lard' was unchanged and rib3 closed oft

Did you ever reflect that the man who is
constantly perpetrating jokes at the expense
of his fellow man is never ready to take Â¦ a
joke himself? This is the case of the man
who is caricatured in* the News Letter. The
publishers give it out cold that their, young
artist,\ Devllinport, Is threatened' with
all the tortures of imagination, on earth and
off of it. if he does not discontinue his pic
tures of a certain Presidential candidate.
The trouble is, there is more ' t rut h ; than
poetry In the News Letter cartoonÂ«\ This
week's issue of that bright weekly is brimful
of clean satirical fun and comment that has
the wholesome quality of flaying alive offend

One . of the many clever things of
the evening was an address by Miss
Anita Day.
There was a social. given last night
by members of the Art Athenaeum
of the Girls' High School, which was
largely attended. The young and am
bitious artists connected with the
athenaeum pleased as entertainers,
giving vocal selections and a comedy
sketch that was admirably droll.
Those that took a prominent part
in the sketch, entitled "The Sewing

INJURED BY A FALL. â Jerry Sullivan, a
carpenter residing at 241 Waller street, was
serevely Injured by fallintr from a staging
on a building at Gough and McAllister street
yesterday. In falling he struck projections
which broke two ribs on his left side. It Is
possible he may have received a fracture of
the skull and internal injuries.
To a few he was known as a miser,
and the few that called "old man"
Davis a miser were nearer right than
they knew -f for when the old man
died last April in his room were found
Fecurities? of great value and memor- I
andum showing that he was more than
a millior.cire. He left exactly $1,397,-

Julius Reis was Davis' one friend.
To him he left the care of his estate.
He named him executor of his will, a
document written in a rambling and
disconnected manner and cc-ntaining
nothing but the mere announcement
that it was his will and that he desired
Ilels to act as executor. The docu
ment did not dispose of a dollar of his
Â¦wealth, nor name any one of his three
relatives, an aged sister, Jane Davis,
an incompetent, who gets, under the
la w, one-half c-f the estate, .and a
nephew and a niece, who divide the
othfcr half.
It is Reis* report as special adminis
trator of the estate of the recluse that
Fhows its sxeat value. It was filed yes

â^Thousands of visitors will be in the
Big Basin Park during the summer.
A stage line is already in operation
from Boulder Creek. A road Is in con
struction from Santa Cruz. This is the
first open season. Visitors will. come
from all sections. The rules for the
guidance of the public are here pub
lished for general information, as fol
lows:
The Commissioners of the Big Basin
Park have just issued a set of rules
to protect the State's new pleasure
ground in Santa Cruz County that has
been opened this season to the general
public. Dangers from fire and the
ravages of vandalism are always pos
sible. The Commissioners have chosen
to warn in mild terms the people that
visit the S3ig Basin Park and- have ap
pealed to them to co-operate in the
preservation of the venerable forest
that has existed for thousands of
years. The defacement of trees by
carving upon them initials and the
placing or painting of advertisements
on trees or rocks in the park will be
regarded as a serio\is misdemeanor to
be dealt with severely.
The committee on rules consists of
Wliliam H. Mills and H. F. Kron.
One paragraph reminds all -persons
that the park belongs to the State and
that they therefore have an interest
in its preservation. "It is the desire of
the commission," so it is set forth,
"that all visitors shall be granted the
utmost freedom .consistent with the
preservation of the park in its natural
state and its protection from fire. It
is also highly desirable that the birds
and animals found in the park shall
be treated with such indifference and
kindness as to accustom them to the
presence of man, to the end that a
condition of semi-domestication shall
ensue."
George F. Fehd is seeking a divorce
from Frances Fehd because, he â¢ says,

Superior Judge Lennon of Marin
County, sitting for Judge F. H. Kerri
gan, yesterday issued an order restrain
ing Johnson G. Newsom of the Elkus-
Brenner Company from disposing of his
interest In the firm pending the trial of
the suit for divorce brought against
him by Mary Newsom. Judge Lennon
also issued an order directing Newsom
to appear before Judge Kerrigan next
Friday to show cause why he should
not^ay his wife 575 a month alimony
pending her suit, $25 costs of court and
$250 for counsel fees.

The motion of Philip Kohn, the the
atrical man. for a transfer to Marin
County of the suit for maintenance
brought against him by Estella Kohn,
his wife, was heard by Judge Seawell
yesterday and continued for two weeks.
An affidavit by Kohn containing his
sworn statement that he is a resident
of Marin County was read, as was also
one .by , Mrs. Kohn, in which she de
clared that Kohn resides In this city.
Judge Seawell did not feel capable of
determining which affidavit contained
the truth, eo he put the matter over to
enable the parties to produce sufficient
evidence to enable him to determine in
which county Kohn does reside.
Judge Heawell yesterday set aside the
decree of divorce obtained from Soren
Peter Xielsen by Bessie Nielsen last
February, stipulating, however, that
Nielsen pay $100 to the attorney that
conducted Mrs. Neilsen's case. The
setting aside of interlocutory decrees of
divorce is now almost a common prac
tice. It 'has the effect of restoring to
the status of married persons couples
who after securing a decree desire to
become reconciled.
The voyage upon the sea of matri
mony undertaken by Luis Herrera and

the training departments of the State j
Normal School, were held yesterday |
afternoon. President Frederick Burk j
of the State Normal School led the ex
ercises, Â¦ and the room was crowded
with relatives and friends. The pro
gramme consisted of songs by the |
class, a flag drill, a class quartet, to- j
gether with a solo by Miss Frances I
Brantwein and a class prophecy by j
Miss Lillian Niggles. Two interesting
cssaj's were read, "A Trip to Wash

well composed by the students and
sung by twenty of the j young ladies.
In the evening the California School

workshops and the public was given a
chance, which it willirvgfy accepted, to
Inspect the work of the students. All
the departmentsâ the blacksmith shop,
the carpenter shop and the woodwork
shopâ were thronged, while the girls'
Â¦Oepartments of cookery, millinery and
dressmaking proved particularly inter
esting.'
Graduating exercises at the Califor
nia School of Mechanical Arts will take
place next Tuesday evening.
The donor of the prize was Regent
Taussig, who presented an order for
Gibson to receive a box of tools, to
cost $20. ,
Certificates were granted to the fol
lowing, named students who have left
the school during the last year after an

Professor Merrill announced that a
member of the committee on Wilmerd
ing school had given a prize ev^ry
year to the highest graduate and that
this year Theodore Gibson would re
ceive the prize.
Following is a list of the graduates
who received their diplomas from Re
gent Taussig: . t,
Course In cabinet-making â Theodore Gibson,
San Francisco; Robert Wiltshire Saunders,
Keno. Nevada. Course In forgework â Albert

He declared that he would never be
happy until the university extension
has spread to that part of the city
where the Wilmerding school is situ
ated.
In England, he said, the university
extension reached the great, center of
those engaged in mechanical occupa
tion.
Professor Stephens paid the Wil
merding school a high compliment, for
he recognized the endeavor of the di
rectors and the staff to turn out skill
ed workmen.
With kindly words to the students
Professor Stephens brought his ad
dress to a close with a Quotation from
Rudyard Kipling appropriate to his
subject.
He then spoke of the "skilled" and
â¢^unskilled workman," professional and
artisan, and said that it was not a
matter of the work turned out, but
was entirely a question of skill.
Whether physician or lawyer, the
work of the unskilled is perceptibly a
failure, while the work of the skilled
meets its reward: and the same con
ditions and recognition faced those that
work by hand.
All skilled workmen, he . said, are
bound together and their business is
to strike out against the unskilled, to
recognize the great bond in good work.
â¢The unskilled man, he said, does not
enjoy Mis labor and whatever enjoy
ment he gets he seeks, in the saloon,
but the skilled workman watches and
sees the work grow under his hand to
per'ect completion with a pride and
enjoyment. : â¢ . !
Professor Stephens spoke in terms of
eulogy of the system placing such
schools as the Wilmerding under the
supervision of the Regents of the Uni
versity of California. The American
university extends itself, he said,
through the university extension to
the agricultural districts, and alluding
to the extension work he had been
carrying on here, he said he believed
that the university work should go to
those of the city of San Francisco who
could not attend the university.
COMPLIMENTS SCHOOL.
Professor Stephens resented the cus
tom of the artisan to arrogate to him
self, and himself alone, the title of
"workman," since, as the professor put
it. all men that are skillful workers,
both in the -professions and in the
trades, are in the true sense of the
term "workingmen."
He offered Mr. Taussig and himself
as examples of "workingmen." The
word "workingman," he considered,
was put to evil use. There could be
no happiness here, he said, unless they
all realized that they belonged to the
same grade and the same group.
ALJj ARE WORKIXGMEX.
Professor Stephens chose for his sub
ject the labor of hand and the labor
of brain and showed by careful analy
sis that there was not a particle of
difference between the man that works
as an artisan and the man that works
in the professions.
A vocal selection was splendidly ren
dered by Miss Pauline M. Grant, who
was compelled to respond to an encore,
and then Regent Taussig Introduced
Professor Henry Morse Stephens, who
was accorded a hearty welcome.
If it wrre practicable I should certainly be
with the boyn of the Wilmerdlng. for the
State feels that the work being done at the
school Is of the utmost Importance to the
State. Therefore, as Governor and as a lover of
thÂ« boys, I would be more than glad to tell
th<Â» Wilmerdins students how much wo all
think of them and the school.
Governor Pardee wrote as follows:
The graduating exercises of the Wi!
merding School of Industrial Arts were
held yesterday morning. Regent Ru
dolph J. Taussig, chairman of the Wil
merdlngr School committee, presided
and with him on the platform were
Professor Henry Morse Stephens 'and
George A. Merrill, B. S., director of the
school.
The students took position on either
side of the platform and after Dr.
Robert Whitaker, pastor of the Twen
ty-third Baptist Church, Oakland, had
delivered an earnest invocation, the
Lick orchestra, under the direction of
Percy E. Cecil, surprised the audience
with the excellence and evenness of its
playing.
Regent Taussig then read a letter of
regret Â¦ from Governor Pardee, who
found it impossible to be present as he
had intended. ..
