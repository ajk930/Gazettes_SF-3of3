THE TWO VANREVELS
IN view of the furpnsing
dearth of really good books
during the past season
some of those that made
their appearance a year or more
â¢go are now enjoying a re
markable new popularity; none
more so than "The Two Van
revels," by Booth Tarkington,
which may, however, be better
accounted for* by the fact that
this last creation is said to be
by far the best novel ever writ
ten by the talented young au
thor of "Monsieur Beaucaire"
and "A Gentleman From Indi
*r.Â»." It is a stirring story, and
io great has been the demand
for It that the Sunday Call, fol
lowing its literary policy of giv
ing it* reader* the very best
American literature obtainable,
has icccred it by special ar
rangement* with the publishers.
It will therefore be printed
complete in the Sunday Call
Magazine in four installments â
of which this Is the second â
an offer never before equaled
in the West. "The Two Van
revels" cannot be secured any
where in any other form for
less than five times what it will
cost you in the Sunday CalL

f harply fastening the spiked hooks in
the roof. As the eaves projected fully
three feet, this left the grappling-lad
der hanging that distance out from the
wall its lowest rung a little above the
level of the chiefs shoulders
Â« m,7 B^Â»y drew m her breath with
â  little choked cry. There was a small

almost without noting her action in
mounting thither, so strained was the
concentration of her attention upon the
figure high up in the rose glow against
the warehouse wall. The man. surely
eure: y . was not solne to trust himself
to that bit of wooden web hanging
from the roof! Where wi. Miss Ba
reaud that she Dermltted it? Ah if
Betty had been Fanchon. and madwo
man enough to have accepted this mad
man, she would have compelled him to
come down at once, and thereafter
would lock him up in the house when
ever the bells rang!
But the roof was to be mounted or
Robert Carewe's property lost. Al
ready little flames were dancing up
from the shingles, where firebrands
had fallen, their number increasing
with each second. So Vanrevel raised
his arms, took a hard grip upon the
lowest rung of the grappling-ladder
and tried it with his weight; the Iron
hooks bit deeper into the roof; they
held. He swung himself out into the
air with nothing: beneath him. caught
the rung under his knee, and for a mo
meat hung there, while the crowd with
held from breathing; then a cloud of
rmoke. swirling that way, made him
the mere ghostly nucleus of itself,
blotted him out altogether, and, as It
rose slowly upward, showed the ladder
free and empty, so that at first there
â was an instant when they thought that
he had fallen. But. as the smoke
cleared, there was the tall figure on the
roof.
It was an agile and a daring thing to
do, and the man who did it was might
ily applauded. The cheering bothered
him. however, for he was trying to
make them understand, below, what
would happen to the engine company
In ca?e the water was not sent through
the lines directly; and what he said
should be done to the engineers in
cluded things that would have -blanched
the cheek ot the must inventive Span
ish inquisitor that ever lived.
Miss Bettv made a gesture as if to a
person within whispering distance.
"Your roat is on fire," she said in an
ordinary- conversational tone, without
knowing she had spoken aloud, and Mr.
Van revel, more than one hundred feet
Bvsy, seemed particularly conscious of
the pertinence of her remark. He re
moved the garment with alacrity, and,
for the lack of the tardy water, began
to use it as a flail upon the firebrands
end little flames about him; the sheer
dcFpernte b*>st of a man in a rage, do
ing what he could when others failed
him. Showers of sparks fell upon him;
the smoke was rising everywhere from
the roof and the walls below; and.
proving denser and denser, shrouded
him in hpavy veils, so- that, as he ran
h her and thither, now visible, now un
swn, stamping and beating and sweep-
Ing away the brands that fell, he
eeemed but the red and ghostly carica
ture of a Xerxes, ineffectually lashing
the Rca. They were calling to him lm
plorinply to come down. In heaven's
Bim<> to come down!
The second man had followed to the
top or tnÂ» ladder against the wall, and
there he paused, waiting to pass up the
line of hose when the word should come
that the force pump had been repaired;
but the people thought that he waited
because he was afraid to trust himself
to the grappling-ladder. He was afraid,
exceedingly afraid; though that was
not why he waited; and hÂ» was still
chuckling over the assault of the axes.
His situation had not much the ad
vantage of that of the chief; his red
shirt might have been set with orange
Jewels, so studded it was with the fly-
Ing sparks; and, a large brand drop
ping upon his helmet, he threw up his
hand to dislodge it and lost the helmet.
ThÂ« great light fell upon his fair hair
and smiling, face, and it was then that
Miss Betty recognized the Incroyable
of her garden.
CHAPTER VI.
TEOB EVER UNPRACTICAL. FEMI
NINE.
It was an investigating negro child of
tender years, who, possessed of a petty
sense of cause and effect, brought an
illuminative simplicity to bear upon the
problem of the force pump; and a mul
titudinous agitation greeted his discov
ery that the engineers had forgotten to
connect their pipes with the river.
This naive oml|sion was fatal to the
second warehouse; the wall burst into
flame below Crailey Gray, who clung
to the top of the ladder, choking, stifled
and dizzily fighting the sparks that
covered him, yet still clutching the
nozzle of the hose line they had passed
to him. When the stream at last
leaped forth, making the nozzle fight
tn his grasp, he sent it straight up in
the air and let the cataract fall back
upon himself and upon the two men
beneath him on the ladder.
There came a moment of blessed re
lief; and he looked out over the broad
rosy blur of faces in the street, where
no one wondered more than he how the
â water was to reach the roof. Suddenly
he started, wiped his eyes with his wet
sleeve, and peered Intently down from
under the shading arm. His roving
glance crossed the smoke and flame to
rest upon a tall, white figure that
stood, full-length above the heads of
the people, upon a pedestal wrought
with the grotesque Images of boys; a
girl's figure, still as noon, enrapt, like
the statue of some young goddess for
whom were made these sacrificial pyres.
Mr. Gray recognized his opportunity.
A blackened and unrecognizable face
peered down from the eaves, and the
voice belonging to It said angrily:
"Why didn't they send up that line
before they put the water through it?"
"Never mind, Tom," answered Crai
ley, cheerfully. "I'll bring it up."
"You can't: I'll come down for It.
Donf be every kind of a fool!"
"You want a monopoly, do you?" And
Crailey. calling to Tappingham Marsh,
next below him, to come higher, left
the writhing nozzle in the latter's pos
session, swung himself out upon the
grappllng-ladder, imitating the chief's
gymnastics, and immediately, one hand
grasping the second rung, one knee
crooked over the lowest, leaned head
down and took the nozzle from Marsh.
It was a heavy weight, and though
Marsh supported the line beneath it, the
great stream hurtling forth made it a
difficult thing to manage, for it wig
gled, recoiled and struggled as if it
had been alive. Crailey made three at
tempts to draw himself up; but the
strain was too much for his grip, and
on the third attempt his fingers melted
frrfm the rung, and he swung down
fearfully, hanging by his knee, but still
clinging to the nozzle.
"Give it up, Crailey; it isn't worth it,"
Vanrevel called from overhead, not dar
ing the weight of both on the light
grappling-ladder.
But though Crailey cared no more for
the saving of Robert Carewe's prop
erty than for a butterfly's wing in
China, he could not give up now, any
more than as a lad he could have for
borne to turn somersaults when the
prettiest little girl looked out of the
Echooihouse window. He passed
the nozzle to Toppfngham, caught
the second rung with his
left hand, and, once more hanging
head downward, seized the noz
zle; then, with his knee hooked tight,
as the gushing water described a huge
semi-circle upon the smoke and hot va
por, he made a mad lurch through the
aia, while women shrieked: but he
landed upright, half-sitting on the low
est rung. He climbed the grappllng
ladder swiftly. In spite of the weight
and contortions of the unmanageable
beast he carried with him; Tom leaned
far dewn and took It from him; and
Crailey. passing the eaves. Â»li, ex
hausted, upon the roof. Just as he
reached this temporary security, a lady
was borne, fainting, out of the acclaim
ing crowd. Fanchon was there. %
Word had been passed to the gentle
men of the "Engine Company" to shut
off the water in order to allow the line
to be carried up the ladder, and they
received the command at the moment
Tom lifted the nozzle, ko that the
stream dried up in his hands. This was
the last straw, and "the blackened,
singed and Bcarred chief, setting the
trumpet to his lips, gave himself en
tirely to wrath.
It struck Crailey, even cs he lay,
coughing and weeping with smoke, that
there was something splendid and large
in the other's rage. Vanrevel was ordi
narily so steady and cool that this was
worth -eeing, this berserker gesture;
worth hearing, this wonderful profan
ity, like Washington's one fit of curs-
Ing; and Crailey, knowing Tom, knew,
too, that it had not come upon him be
cause Carewe had a daughter Into
whose eyes Tom had looked; nor did he
rage because he believed that CraUey's
life and his were in the greater hazard
for the lack of every drop of water that
should have isued from the empty noz
sle. Their lungs were burdened with
smoke, while the Intolerable smarting
of throat, eyes and nostrils /was like
the incision ut a thousand needles in
the membranes: their clothes were lu
minous with glowing circles where the
sparks were eating; the blaze widened
on the wall beneath them, and Marsh
was shouting hoarsely that he could no
longer hold his position on the ladder;
yet Crailey knew that none of this was
in Tom's mind as he stood, scorched,
blistered and haggard, on the edge of
the roof, shaking his fist at the world.
It was because his chance of saving the
property of a man he despised was be
ing endangered:
Crailey stretched forth a hand and
touched his friend's knee. "Your side
of the conversation is a trifle loud.
Tom," he said. "Miss Carewe is down
there, across the street, on a pile of
boxes."
Tom stopped in the middle of a word
for which he may have received but
half a black stroke from the recording
angel. He wheeled toward the street,
and, shielding his Inflamed eyes with
his hand, gazed downward In a stricken
silence. From that moment Mr. Van
revel's instructions to his followers were
of a decorum at which tot the meek
est Sunday-school scholar- dare have
caviled. â¢
The three men now* cm the long lad
der, Marsh, Eugene Madrlllon and Will
Cummings, found their position unten
able; for the flames, reaching all along
the wall, were . licking at the ladder
itself, between Marsh and Eugene. "I
can't stand this any longer," "gasped
Tappingham, "but I "can't leave those
two up there, either." "" . ' ,
"Not alone," shouted Cummings'from
beneath Madrillpn. "Let's go i up."
Thus it happened;: that when the
water came again, arid Vanreyel let It
fall In a grateful cascade upon. Crailey
and himself, three manly voices were
heard singing, as three men , toiled
through the billows of rosy gray, below
the beleaguered pair: s â¢-.
"Oh the noble Duks of Tork, '
' Ha had ten thousand men; . :â  â¢ .
Be marched them up the. side of * boum.
And marched f.hem down again!" '".*.. ' .
A head appeared above the eaves, and
Marsh, then Eugene, .then Cummings,
came crawling over the cornice In turn,
to. Join' their comrades. They were a
gallant band, those young gentlemen
of Rouen, and thje.y .' came 4 with the
ironical song on. their lips, and, looking
at one another, ragged and; scarified,:
burst into hoarse but: indomitable
laughter. ;.^ - â¢
Two others made an -attempt to fol
low, and wouM not be restrained. : It
was noticed that parts of the lower lad-

der had been charring; and the ladder
men were preparing to remove It to a
less dangerous point, when old General
Trumble and young Jefferson Bareaud
made a rush to mount It. and were well
upon their upward way before the lad
der, weakened at the middle, sagged,
splintered and broke, Trumble and Ba
reaud falling with it. And there was
the grappling-ladder. dangling forty
feet above the ground: and there were
the five upoii the roof.
The department had no other ladder
of more tha^ half the length of, the
shattered one. Not only the depart
ment, but every soul in Rouen, knew
that; and there arose the thick.' low
sigh of a multitude, a sound frightful
to hear. It became a groan, then
swelled Into a deep cry of alarm and
lamentation..
, And now, almost simultaneously, the
West wall of the building, and the south
wall; and all the southwestern portions
of the. roof, "covered themselves with
voluminous mantles of flame, which In
creased <4S hugely and with such sav
age .. rapidity that the one stream on
the roof was seen to be but a ridiculous
and useless opposition.
Everybody began to shout advice to
his neighbor; and nobody listened even
to/ himself/ 'The firemen were In as
great a turmoil as was the crowd,
while women covered their 'eyes.
Young Frank Chenoweth'was sobbing
curses tiponithf bniised ah,d shaking
Trumble and Jefferson Bareaud, who
could only si and remorseful, im potently
groaning:, anS made no answer.
' The ,walls of the southernmost ware
house - followed . the., roof, crashing: In
ward erne after the other, a sacrificial
pyre with its purpose consummated;
and in the seeth arid flare of its passing.
Tom .Vanrevel again shaded his eyes
with. his hand, and looked down across
the upturned faces. The pedestal with
the grotesque, carvings was still there;
but the crowning figure had disap
pearedâthe . young' goddess was . gone.
For she, of all that throng, had an
Idea in her head, arid;. after: screaming
It to every man within reach, only to
dlsci/ver the impossibility; <5f making
herself understood in that Babel, she
was struggling to make her way toward
the second warehouse, .through' the
swaying Jam of people. "It was a diffi
cult task, as the farther in s she man
aged to go, the denser became* the press
and the more tightly she found the peo
ple Wedged,'. until she'recelyed involun
tary aid from ' the firemen." In , turning
their. second stream to play â  effectually
upon the lower strata of ' flame.' they
accidentally 'deflected It .toward the
crowd, .whV separated â¢ wildly, leaving a
big gap; of whlch'^Mlss ; Betty took In
stant advantage.* .She' 'darted across,
and the next moment, '.unnoticed, had
entered the ' building through ' the , door
which Crailey Gray hadjopened.
-The five young, men^on-the^ roof were
well' aware" that.-. there'.was' little to do
but wait, and soon they would .see
which was to win, they of the fire; so
they shifted their line \of hose" to the
eastern. front of the buildingâ out ' of
harm's way, for a little time, at. leastâ
arid held the nozzle steady, watching
Its work. And In truth It was not long
before they understood which would
conquer. The southern and western
portions of the building had flung out
great flames that fluttered ' and flared
on the breeze like Titanic flags ; and
steadily, slowly, at first, then 'faster aa
the seconds flew-, the five were driven
backward, up" the low' slope of the roof
toward the, gable-ridge.*. Tom Van
revel held the first Joint of the nozzle,
and "he. -retreated.' with .a sulky face,
lifting his fopt grudgingly at each step.
They were all silent now. and no one
spoke until Will Cummings faitered: '.
. "Surely . they'll get a rope up to us
some way?". â¢ â¢ â  . -â  ' . ,'. '
â 'Will' knew as well as the others that
there was no way; but his speech
struck the sullen, heart of the chief with
remorse. He turned. ''I hope you'll all
forgive me for getting 'you. up here."
A sound,, half sob, half" giccle, came
from the. parched lips of Eugene Mad
rlHon. as.h* patted Tom on the shoul
der without speaking, and Crailey
nodded quietly. thÂ£n~ left the group and
went to* thÂ« 'eastern" edge of the roof
and 'looked' out upon the crowd. Cum
mlnps dropped the line and sat down,
burying his hot face In his arms, for
they all saw that Vanrevel thought "it
was no. use," but a question of a few
minutes, and they, would retreat across
the gable and either Jump or go down
with the roof.
Since the world began, idle and in
dustrious philosophers have speculated
much upon the thoughts of men about
to die; yet it cannot be too ingenuous
to believe that such thoughts vary as
the men, their characters and condi
tions of life vary. Nevertheless, pursu
ant with the traditions of minstrelsy
and romance, it is conceivable that
yc/iing. unmarried metl,- called upon to
face desperate situations, might, at the
crucial moment, rush to a common ex
perience of summoning the vision, each
of his heart's desire, and to meet, each
his doom, with her name upon bis HpÂ«.
An extraordinary thing occurred in
the present Instance, for. by means of
some fragmentary remarks let fall at
tha time, and afterward recalled-^uch
as Tappingham Marsh's gasping; "At
least It wlll.be on her father's roof!"
and from other things later overheard,
an Inevitable deduction has been
reached that tout of the fire gentlemen
In the perilous caÂ»Â» herein described
were occupied with the vision of thÂ«
same person, to wit:" Miss Elisabeth
Carewe. "the lastâ the prettiestâ to
come to town!"
Crailey Gray, alone; spoke not at all:
but why did he strain his eyeÂ« toward
that empty pedestal with the grottsqu*
carvings? Did he seek Fanchon there,
or was Miss Carewe the last swÂ«Â«t Ap
parition In the fancies of all flvÂ» of tfl*
unhappy young men?
The coincidence of the actual appear
ance of the lady among them, thÂ«reforÂ«,
seemed the more miraculous, when,
wan and hopeless, staggering desper
ately backward to the gable-ridge, they
heard a clear eontralto voice behind
them:
"Hadn't yon better all com* down
now?" it said. "The stairway will bÂ«
on flrÂ« before Ions."
Only one thing could haye been more
shockingly unexpected to the five than
that there should be a sixth person on
the roof, and this was that the sixth
person should be Miss Betty Carewe.
They turned, aghast, agape, chop
fallen with astonishment, stunned and
incredulous."'
She stood just behind the gable-rldge,
smiling amiably, a most incongruous
lltle Dink fan in her hand, the smoke
wreaths partly obscuring her and curl-
Ing between the five and her whits
dress, like mists floating across the new
moon.
: "Was It but a kindly phantasm of the
brain? "Was It the incarnation of the
last vision of the lost volunteers? Was
it a Valkyrie assuming that lovely
likeness to perch upon this eyrie r wait-
Ing to bear their- heroic souls to Val
halla, orâ was it Miss Betty Carewe? -
To the chief she spokeâ all of them
agreed to that afterward â but it was
Crailey who answered, while. Tom could,
only stare, and stand wagging his head
at the lovely phantom, like a Mandarin
on a shelf.
"My mother In heaven!" gasped CratÂ»
ley. ""How did you come up here?"
"There is a trap in the roof on the
other side of the ridge," she said, and
she began to,fan herself with the pink
fan. "A stairway runs all the way
downâ old Nelson showed me through
these buildings yesterdayâ and that
side isn't on fire yet. I'm so sorry .1
didn't think of it until a moment ago,
because you could have brought the
water up that way. But don't you
think you'd better come down now?"
CHAPTER VIL
THE COMEDIAN.-
N6t savage Hun,- nor "barbarous
Vandyke." nor demon Apache, could
wish to dwell upon the state of mind
of the chief c-f the Rouen Volunteer
Fire. Department: therefore, let thÂ«
curtain of mercy descend. Without a
word, he turned and dragged the nozzto
to the eastern eaves, whence, after- a
warning gesture to those below. hÂ«
dropped It to the ground. And, out ot
compassion, it should be little more
than hinted that the gesture of warning
was very slight.
When the rescued band reached the
foot of the last flight o& stairs, they be
held the open doorway as a frame for
a great press of intent and contorted
faces, every eye still strained to watch
the roof; none of the harrowed specta
tors comprehending the appearance of
the girl's figure there, nor able to see
whither pfce had led the five young
men. until Tappingham Marsh raised a
shout as he leaped out of the door and
danced upon the solid earth again.
Then,. Indeed, there was a mighty up
roar; cheer after cheer ascended to thÂ»
red vault of heaven: women wept. ~ien
whooped, and the people rushed for the
heroes with wide-open. welcoming
arms. Jefferson Bareaud and Frank
Chenoweth and General Tremble
dashed at Tom. Vanrevel with incoher
ent cries of thankssiving. shaking his
hands. and beating him hysterically up
on the back. He greeted them with bit
ter laughter.
"Help get the water Into the next
warehouse; this one Is beyond control,
but we can save' the other two'. Take
the lines Inâ through the door!" He
brushed the rejoicing friends off ab
ruptly, and went on In a queer hollow
voice: "There are stairsâ and I'm so
sorry I didn't think of It until a moment
ago. because you could have brought
the water up that way!"
'A remarkable case of desertion had
occurred the previous Instant under hÂ»s
eyes. As the parly emerged from the
warehouse into the street. Tom heard
Crailey say hurriedly to Miss Carewe:
"Let me get you awayâ come quickly!"
saw him suddenly seize her hand, and.
eluding the onrushlns crdwd; run with
her round the corner of the building.
And. somehow, through what inspira
tion, or through what knowledge of his
partner's "temperament." heaven
knows, the prophetic soul of the. chief
was unhappily assured that" Crailey
would offer himself as escort to her
home, and find acceptance. But why
not? Was It Crailey wno had publicly
called his f ellowman fool. Idiot, lmbe-cl!e. at the to? of his lungs, only to
find h!rrÂ»elf the proven numskull of the
.universe! Tom stood for a moment
ataring after the vanishing pair, while
ever his face stole the strangest ex
pression thct ever man caw there; then,
with meekly bov.ed shoulders, he
turned again to his work.
At the corner c-f the warehouse. Miss
Carewe detnehed her hand fropi Crai
lÂ«jr"Â«, yet still followed him as he made
a gunk detour round the next buiiding.
A niirutc; or two later they found
theniselvcs. undetected, upon Main
street in the rear of the crowd. There
Crsiley paused.
"Forgive me." he said, breathlessly,
"for taking your hand. I thought you
would Jjke to ?et away."
She regarded him gravely, so that he
found it difficult to road her look, ex
cept that it was seriously questioning;
but uheiher the ir.teriogation was ad
dressed to him or to herself he cou!d
- not determine. After a silence she said:
"I <IÂ«_f:i't know why I followed you. I
believe it must have been because you
di-in't give rr.<? time to think."
This, c* course, made him even
quicker tilth her than before. "'It's all

picket fence, and he leaned against it.
evercome by mirth in which she dia
not join. Her gravity reacted upon him
*t once, and his laughter was stopped
ehort. "Will you not accept me as an
escort to vour home?" he said for
mally.
"I do not know." the returned simply,
the sort of honest trouble in her glance
thfit is seen only in very young eyes.
"What reason in the world!" he re
turned, with a crafty sharpness of as
tonishment.
Fhe continued to gaze upon him
thoughtfully, while he tried to look Into
her eyes, but was baffled because thÂ«
radiant beams from the lady's orbs (as
the elder Chenoweth might have said)
rested somewhere dangerously near his
chin, which worried him. for, though
his chin made no retreat and TÂ»as far
from IH-Iooking. it was. nevertheless.
that feature which he most distrusted.
"Won't vtru tell me why not?" he re
peated, uneasily.
"Because," she answered at last,
speaking hesitatingly, "because it isn't
eo easy a matter for me as you seem to
think. You have not been introduced
to me. and I know you never will be,
and that what you told me was true."
"Which part of what I told you?"
The question escaped from him Instan
ter.
"That the others .might come -when
they liked, but that you could not."
"Oh, yes, yes." His expression altered
to a sincere dejection: his shoulders
drooped, and his voice indicated su
preme annoyance. "I might have
known some one would tell you! Who
Â«u It? Did they say why I "
"On acount of your quarrel with my
father/*
"My 'quarrel with your father!" he
exclaimed: and h!s face lit with an
elated surprise; his shoulders straight
ened. He took a etep nearer her, and
asked eagerly: "Who told you that?"
"My father himself. He spoke of a
Mr. Vanrevel whom he disliked, and
whom I must not meet; and. remem
bering what you said, of course I knew
that you were he."
"Oh!" Cralley's lips began to form a
smile of such inimitable sweet
ness that Voltaire would have trusted
him; a smile altogether rose leaves.
â¢"Then I lose you," he eaid. "for my
only chance to know you was In keep
ing it hidden from you. And now you
understand!"
"No." she answered gravely, "I don't
understand; that is what troubles me.
If I d!d and believed you had the right
of the difference. I could believe it no
sin that you should speak to me. should
take me home now. I think it is wrong
not to act from your own understanding
of things."
The younic rr.an set his expression as
one indomitably fixed upon the course
of honor, cr.st what it might; and. in
the very action, his lurking pleasure in
doing it hopped out in the flicker of a
twinkle in 'his eyes, and as instantly
nought cover again â the flea In t" i
rose- jar.
"Then you must usk some other," he
said, firmly. "A disinterested person
should tell you. The difference was
political in the begirming. but became
personal afterward; and it Is now a
quarrel which can never be patched up,
though, for my part, I wish that It
could be. I can say no more, because a
party to it should not sneak-" â¢
She met his level look squarely at
last: and no man #>ver had a more
truthful pair of eyes than Crailey Gray.
for It was his great accomplishment
that he could ad lust his emotion, his
reason and something that might be
called his faith, to fit any situation in
any character.
"You mav tr<ke me home," she an
ewered. "I may be wrong, and even
disloyal; but I do not feel it so now.
You did a very brave thing to-night to
save him from loss, and I think that
what you have said was just what you
should have eaid."
So went down the street, the
hubbub and confusion of the fire grow
ing more and more indistinct behind
them. They walked slowly, and, for a
time, neither spoke; yet the silence
w.is of a kind which the adept rejoiced
to have produced thus soon â the If sec
ond meeting. For he believed there
were more strange things In heaven
and earth than Horatio wot: and one
of the strangest was that whenever he
was near an attractive woman during
during a silence such as this, something
not to be defined, but as effective as it
was definite, always went out from
him to her. It was like a word of ten
derness, a word too gentle, too compell
ing, too sweet, to be part of any. tongue,
spoken or written. And mort, this in
effable word had an echo, and came
back' to him from the woman.
As his partner had in dress, so Crai
ley had with women, some color of the
beau; but it was not in what experi
ence had given him lo recouuize as a
fact: tb^at they were apt to fall in love
with hhn. (That they wer* apt to re
main in love with him â he understood
perfectly â was another matter.) And
he knew when they were doing it; couid
have told them accurately, at each
step, what they were feeling, thinking,
dreaming, during the process, because
he was usually exhibiting the same
â¢symptoms to himself at the same time.
Thus, his own breast occupied with
that dizzy elation which followed its
reception of the insane young god's ar
rows, and his heart warm with the
rise of the old emotion that he knew so
well, he was nevertheless able to walk
with bis finger on the pulse of the ex-
quisite moment her heart-beats his
own.
So, to his fancy, as they walked, the
little space between them hung with
brilliant strands, like gossamer chains
of gold, already linking them together;
every second fixing another slender,
precious fetter, binding them closer,
drawing her nearer. He waited until
they passed into the shadows of the de
serted Carewe street before he spoke.
There he abruptly stopped; at which
ehe turned, astonished.
"Now that you have saved my life."
he said, in a low, tremulous tone, "what
are you going to do with it?"
Her eyes opened almost as widely as
they had at her first sight, of him in
her garden. There was a long pause
before she replied, and when she did, it
yas to his considerable surprise.
"I have never seen a play, except the
funny little ones we acted at the con
vent," she said, "but isn't that the way
they speak on the stage?"
Crailey realized that his judgment of
the silence had been mistaken, and yet
it was with a thrill of delight 'that he
recognized her clear reading of him.
He had been too florid again.
"Let us go." His voice was soft with
restrained forgiveness. "You mocked
me once before."
"Mocked you?" she repeated, as they
west on."
"Mocked me," he said, firmly.
"Mocked me for seeming theatrical,
and yet you have learned that what I
said was true, as you will again." .
"Well, tell me what you mean when
you say I saved your life."
"You came alone." he began, hastily,
"to stand upon that burning roof "
"Whence all but him had fled!" Her
laughter rang out. Interrupting him.
"My room was on the fourth floor at St.
Mary's, and I didn't mind climbing
three flights this evening." . i'ilij
Crailey's good-nature was always
perfect. "You mock me and you mock
me!" he cried, and made her laughter
but part of a gay duet. "I know I have
gone too fast, have said things I should
have waited to sav: but. ah! remem
ber the small chance I have against
the others who can see you when they
like. Don't flout me because I try to
make the most of a rare, stolen moment
with you."
"Do!" she exclaimed, grave upon the
instant. "Do make the most of it! I
have nothing but inexperience. Make
the most by treating me seriously.
Won't you? I know you can, and I â
Iâ" She faltered to a full stop. She
was earnest and quiet, and there had
been something in her tone, tooâ as
very often there wasâ that showed how
young she was. "Oh!" she began
again, turning to him Impulsively, "I
have thought about you since that
evening in the garden, and I have
wished to know you. I can't be quite
clear how it happened, but even those
few minutes left a number of strong
impressions about you. And the strong
est was that you were one with whom
I could talk of a great many things, if
you would only be real with me. I be
lieve^ â though I'm not sure why I do â
that It is very difficult for you to be
real; perhaps because you are so differ
ent at different times that you aren't
cure, yourself, which the real vou is.
But the person that you are beginning
to be for my benefit must be "the most"
trifling of all your selves, lighter and
easier to put on than the little mask
you carried the other night. If there
were nothing better beneath the mask,
I might play, too.". .-' ,
"Did you learn this at the convent?"
gasped Crailey. . â¢ . ;
"There was a world there 'in minia
ture," she answered., speaking - very
quickly. "I think all people are made
of the same material, only in such dif
ferent proportions. I think a Htle
world might hold as much as the larg
est. If you thought it all out hard
enough, and your experience might be
just as broad and deep in a small cor
ner of the earth as anywhere else. But
I don't know! I want to understandâ I
want to understand everything! I
read books, and there .are people^-but
no one who tells me what I want âIâ"
"Stop." He lifted his hand. "I won't
act; I shall never 'play' for you again."
He was breathless; the witching silence
was nothing to what stirred him now.
A singular exaltation rose in him, to
gether with the reckless impulse to
speak from the mood her vehement
confidence had inspired. . He gave way
to It! ' â¢ ' ' â¢ -
"I know. I know," he said huskily.
"I a'U you mean, all you
feel, all you wish. It is all echoing
here, and here, and here!" He
touched his breast, his eyes and his
forehead with the flncers of his long
and slender hand. "We sigh and strain
our eyes and stretch out .our. arms in
the dark, groping always for, the
strange blessing that is. just beyond our
grasp, seeking for the precious un
known that" lies just over the horizon!
It's what they meant by the pot of gold
where' the rainbow ends^-only, it may
be there, after all!"
They stopped unconsciously, and re
rriained standing at the lower end .of
the' Carewe hedge.. The western glow
had faded," and she was gazing, at him
through the darkness. leaning forward,
never dreaming 'that her tight grasp
had broken the sticks of the little pink
fan. â¢ â¢
"Yes," she whispered, .eagerly. "You
are right; you understand!" â¢
He went on. the words coming faster
and faster: "We are hauntedâ you. and
Iâ by the wish to know all things, and
by the question that lies -under every
thought we have: the agonizing Whith
er? Isn't it like that? It is really
death that makes us think. You are
a good Catholic;- you go to mass; but
you wish to know. Does God reign, or
did it all happen? Sometimes It seems
so deadly probable that the universe
just was, no God to plan it, nothing but
things: thRt we die as sparrows die,
and the brain is all the soul we have, a
thing that becomes clogged and stops
some day. And Is that all?"
She shivered slightly, but her stead
fast eyes did not shift from him. He
threw back his head, and his face up
liftÂ«l to. the jeweled sky of the moon
less night, was beatific In its peaceful
ness, as he continued In. an altered
tone, gentle and low:
"I think all questions are answered
there. The stars tell It all. When you
look at them you know. They have put
them on our flag. There are times
when this seems but a poor nation ;
boastful, corrupt, violent, and prepar
ing, as it is. now, to steal another coun
try by fraud and war; "yet the stars
on the flag always make me happy and
confident.' Do you see the constella
tions swinging aboveus, such unimag
inable .vastnesses, not roving or crash
ing through the illimitable at haphaz

the most delicate clockwork man ever
made? The great ocean-lines mark our
seas with ; their paths through the
water; the fine brains of the earth are
behind the ships that sail from port to
port, yet how awry the system goes!
When does a ship come to her harbor
at an hour determined when she sailed?
What is a ship beside the smallest
moon of the â¢ smallest world? But,
there above us, moons, worlds, suns, all
the infinite cluster of colossi, move Into
place to the exactness of a hair at the
precise instant. That instant has. been
planned, you see; it is part of a system
âand can a system exist that no mind
made? Think of the mind that. made
this' one! Do you believe so inconceiv
ably majestic an intelligence as that
could be anything but good? . Ah, when
you wonder, look \ above ydu; . look
above you in the night, I say," he cried,
his hand upraised like his transfigured
face. "Look above sou and you will
never fear that a sparrow's fall could
go unmarked!" â  '
It was not to the stars, that she
looked, but to the orator, as long as he
held that pose, which lasted until a
hard-ridden horse came galloping down
the street. As itdashed.by, though the
rider looked neither < :to right nor left.
Miss Betty unconsciously made a fev
erish clutch at. her companion's sleeve,
drawing him closer to the hedge.
. "It is my father," she said hurriedly
In a low voice. I'He must not see you.
You must never come here. Per
haps â â¢â¢ she paused, then quickly
whispered: "You have been very kind
to me. Good-night."
.He looked at her keenly, and through
the dimness saw that her face was
shining with excitement. He did not
speak again, but, taking a step back
ward, smiled, faintly, bent his head in
humble -acquiescence, and made *1a
slight gesture of his hand for her to
leave him. She set her eyes upon his
once more, then turned swiftly and al
most ran along the hedge to the gate;
but there she stopped and looked back.
He was standing where she had left
him. his face again uplifted to the sky.
She waved him an uncertain farewell,
and ran Into the garden, both palms
against her burning cheeks.
Night is the rreat necromancer, and
strange are the fabrics he weaves; he
lays queer spells; breathes so eerie an
intoxication through the dusk; he can
cast such glamours about a .voice! He
is the very king of fairyland.
Miss Betty began to walk rapidly* up
and down the garden paths, her head
bent and her hands still pressed to her
cheeks; now and then an unconscious
exclamation burst from her, incoherent,
more like a gasp than a word. A long;
time she paced the vigil with her stir

with a placid, unremembering eye. She
began to. stare at them in a puzzled

CHAPTER VIII.
A TALE OF A POLITICAL DIFFER
ENCE.
: Mr. Carewe was already at the break
fast-table,, but the .light of his-counte
nance, hidden behind the Rouen Jour
,nal, was not vouchsafed to his .daugh
ter when she took her place opposite
him. nor did he, see fit to return her
morning greeting, from which she gen
erously concluded that the. burning of
the two warehouses had .meant a severe
loss to him. - ... â 
"I. am. so sorry, father," she said
gently. (She had not called him "papa"
since the morning after her ball.)
"I hope it isn't to be a great trouble to
you." There was no response, and,
after waiting for some time, she spoke
again, rather tremulously, yet not tim
idly: "Father?".
â¢He -rose, and upon his . brow were
marked the blackest lines of anger she
had ever seen, so that she. leaned back
from him, startled;- but he threw down
the open paper before, her on the table.
and struck.it with his clenched fist.- .
â¢'Read that!" -be said. And he stood
over her while she read. â¢
There were some grandiloquent head
lines: "Miss Elizabeth Carewe-an An
gel of Mercy! S Charming Belle--. Saves
the Lives.,-* Five Promlne- . citizens!
Her Presence of Mmd Prevents Confla
gration From -Wiping .out the , City!"
It- may be noted- that Will Cummings.
editor and proprietor of the Journal,
had written these tributes, as well as
the. whole account, of the ivening's
transactions, and Miss' Betty loomed as
large in Will's narrative as In his good
and lovelorn heart. >There was. very
little concerning; the fire in the. Journal;
it. was nearly all about Betty. That is
one of the misfortunes which pursue a
lady who, allows an editor to fall in
love. with her. . . . -â¢'-
However.. there was a scant mention
of the arrival of the Volunteers "upon
the scene" (though none at all at the
cause of their delay), and an: eloquent
paragraph was devoted to their hand
some appearance, Mr. Cummings hav
ing been one of, those who Insisted that
the new uniforms should be worn.
"Soon,", said t he Journal, "through the
daring of the chief of the department,
and the captain of the hook-and-ladder
company, one of whom ''placed and
mounted the grappling-ladder, over
which he was immediately followed by
the other carrying the hose, a stream
was sent to play ' upon the â¢ devouring
element, a feat of derring-do person
ally witnessed by a majority of our
readers. Mr. Vanrevel and Mr. Gray
were joined by Eugene Madrillon, Tap
pingham Marsh and the editor of this
paper, after which occurred_ the , unfor
tunate accident tc_ the long .ladder,
leaving the five named- gentlsmen. In
their, terrible predicament, face to face
with death in its most awfulform. At
thla trighltul moment"â and all the
rest was about Miss Carewe.
As Will himself admitted, he had
"laid himself out on that description."
One paragraph was composed of short
sentences, each beginning with the
word "alone." "Alone she entered the
shattered door! Alone she set foot up
on the first flight of stairs! Alone she
ascended the second! Alone she mount
ed the third. Alone she lifted her hand
to. the trap! Alone she opened it!" She
was declared to have made her appear
ance to the unfortunate prisoners on the
roof, even as "the palm-laden dove to
the despairing Noah." and Will also as
serted repeatedly that she was the
"Heroine of the Hour."
Miss Betty blushed to see her name so
blazoned forth. in print: but she lacked
one kind "of vanity, and failed to find
good reason for more than a somewhat
troubled laughter, the writer's purpose
was so 'manifestly kind In spite of the
bizarre result. â â¢ . ~ ' V
"Oh, I wisher.; Cummings hadn't!"
she exclaimed.- "it. would have been
better not td Â»p*ak -of me at all, of
course: but I can't see that there is
anything to resent-rit'is so funny!"
"Funny!" Mr. Carewe repeated the
word In a cracked ' falsetto, with the
evident intention of .mocking her, and
at the same time hideously contorted
his face into a grotesque Idiocy cf ex
pression, pursing his lips so extremely,
and setting his brows so awry, that his
other features were carried out of all
familiar .likeness, effecting an altera
tion as shocking to behold in a man of
his severe cast of countenance, as was
his falsetto mimicry to hear. She rose
In a kind of terror, perceiving that the
contortion was ] produced in burlesque
of her own expression, and, as he
pressed nearer her, stepped back, over
turning her chair. She had little recol
lection of her father during her child
hood; and as long an she could remem
ber, no one had spoken to her angrily,
or even rousrhly.
- As she retreated from him. he leaned
forward, thrusting the hideous mask
closer to her white and horror-stricken
face.
"You can't see anything to resent in
that!" he gibbered. "It's so funny, is
it? ' Funny! . . Funny! Funny! I'll
show you whether it's funny or not. I'll
show you!" His voice rose almost to a
shriek. "You hang around fires, do
you, on the public streets at night?
You're a nice one- for me to leave in
charge of my house while I'm away,
you trollop! What did you mean by
going up on that roof? You knew that
damned Vanrevel was there! You did,
I say, you knew it!" <
She ran toward . the . door with a
frightened cry; but he got between It
and her, menacing her with his up
raised open hand, staking them over
her.
"You're a lovely daughter, aren't
you!" he shouted hoarsely. "You knew
perfectly well who -was on that roof,
and you went! Didn't you go? Answer
me that! If I'd had. arms about me
when I got there, I'd have shot that
man dead! He . was ' on my property,
giving orders, the black htund! And
when I ordered him out. he told me if
I interfered with his work before It was
finished, hp'd have me thrown out â me
that owned .the whole place; and there
wasn't a man that would lend me a pis
tol! 'Rescue!' You'd better rescue him
f-aom me, you palm-laden dove, for I'll
shoot him. I will! I'll kill that dog; and
he knows . it. He can bluster in a
crowd, but he'll hide now!' He's a
coward and "., â 
"He came home with me; he brought
me home last night!" Her voice rang
out in : the room like . that of some
other person, and she hardly knew that
it was herself who spoke-"/.',
."You lie!" he screamed, and fell back
from her, his face. working as though
under the dominance of some physical
disorder, the flesh of it. plastic beyond
conception, so that- she cried out and
covered her, face with her arm. "You
lie! I saw you at the hedge with Crai
ley Gray, though you thourht I didn't.
What do you want^to He like that for?
Vanrevel didn't even speak to you. I
asked Madrillon. You lie!"
He choked upon the words; a racking;
cough shook him from head to foot;
he staggered back and. dropped upon
her overturned chair, his arms beating
the table In 'ront of him, his head
jerking spasmodically backward and
forward as he gasped for breath.
"Ring the bell,", he panted thickly,
with an incoherent gesture. "Nelson
knows. Ring!" â¢ '.
Nelson evidently knew. He brought
brandy and water .from the sideboard
with no stinting hand, and within ten
minutes Mr., Carewe was in his accus
tomed seat, competent to finish his
breakfast. In solitude,' however, he sat.
and no one guessed his thoughts.
For Miss Betty had fled to 'her own
room and had bolted the door. She lay
upon the bed, shuddering and shivering
with nausea, and cold, though the day
was warm. .Then, like a hot pain In
her breast, came a homesickness for
St. Mary's, and the flood-tide of tears,
as she thought of the quiet convent In
the sunshine Â».f the west, the peace of
it, and the goodness of everybody theraw
" Sister Cecilia !" Her shoulder*
shook with the great sob that followed
this name, dearest to her in the world,
convulsively whispered to the pillow.
"Dear Sister Cecilia!" She patted the
white pillow with her hand, as though
it were the cool cheek against which
she yearned to lay her own. "Ah, you
would knowâ you would know!" With
the thought of the serene face of the
good sister, and of the kind arms that
would have pone round her in her trou
ble, her sobbing grew loud and uncon
trollable. But she would not have her
father hear it. and buried her face deep
in the pillow. After a time, she began
to grow quieter, turned, and lay with
wet eyes, .her under Ud quivering with
the deep intake of each broken sigh.
"Oh, stars, stars, stars!" she- whis
pered.
"Missy?" There came a soft knock
upon the door and the clink of sliver
upon china. "Missy?"
"What Is it?"
So auick was Miss Betty that, al
though she answered almost at once,
the tears were washed av.ay, and shs
was passing a cool, wet towel over her
eyes at the moment she spoke.
"Jas me. I brung yo.' breakfaa*,
honey."
Old Nelson's voice was always low
and gentle, with a quaver and hesi
tancy in the utterance; now it was ten
der and comforting with the compre
hension of one suffering, the extraordi
nary tact, which the old of his racÂ»
nearly all come to possess. "Ll'l chick
en-wing on piece brown toast, honey."
When she opened the door he came in,
bending attentively over his tray, and.
without a glance toward his young mis
tress, made some show of fuss and bus
tle, as he placed it upon a table near
the window and drew up a chair for
her so that she could sit with her back
to the light- jrZ
"Dah now!" he exclaimed softly, re
moving the white napkin and display-
Ing other dainties besides the chicken
*lng. "Dess de way! Dat ole mammy
in the kitchen, she got her fallln' an'
her grlevin* sins; but de way she do
han'le chicken an' biscuit sutney ain't
none on 'em! She plead fo* me to ax
you how you like dem biscuit."
He kept his head bent low over the
table, setting a fork closer to Betty's
hand; arranging the plates, then rear
ranging them, but never tumine his
Â«yes in her direction.
"Dat ole mammy mighty vain, yes
suh!" He suffered a very quiet chuckle
to escape him. "She did most Â«utney
'sist dat I ax you ain't you like dem
biscuit. She de ve'y vaines* woman In
dis State, dat ole mammy, yessuh!" And
now he cast one quick glance out of
the corner of his eye tt Miss Betty,
before venturing a louder chuckle.
"She reckon dem biscuit goln' git her

hevumly gates!*"Uhuh! I tell her she

ruin dese many yeahs: 'case she as

loud and Ions. "You jass go and talk
wid mammy, some day. Missy; you'll
see how vain dat woman is."
"Has father gone out. Nelson!** asked
Betty in a low voice.
"Yes'm: he up town." The Â©*d man's
tone sank at once to the level of her
own; became confidential, aa on*
speaks to another in a room where
somebody is ill. "He mekkln* prepe

Nelson finished, without too much thÂ«
air of imparting cheery tidings, but
with Just enough.
"Law no. Missy! Dat big Ml* Tan

"What time will father come home?**
"Home? He be gone twÂ© week*,

"No: I mean to-day."
"Law! He ain't comin* back. Bid

Miss Betty had begun to make a
pretense to eat. only to please the old
man, but the vain woman's cookery
had been not unduly extolled, and Nel
son laughed with pleasure to see the
fluffy biscuits and the chicken wing
not nibbled afbut actually eaten. Thla
was a healthy young lady, he thought,
one who would do the household credit
and justify the extravagant pride which
kitchen and stable already had In her.
He was an old house-servant, there
fore he had seen many young ladles go
through unhappy hours, and he ad
mired Miss Betty the more because she
was the first one who had Indulged
In strong weeping and did not snuffle
at intervals afterward. He understood
perfectly everything that had passed
between father and daughter that
morning.
When her breakfast was finished.
she turned slowly to the window, and.
while her eyes did- not refill, a alight
twitching of the upper lids made him
believe that she was going over the
whole scene again in her mind; where
upon he began to move briskly about
the rocm with a busy air. _icklnjc up
her napkin, dusting a chair with his
hand, exchanging the position of the
andirons in the fireplace: and. appar

George* Meilhac was ont of line, he set
It awry, then straight again, the while
he hummed an Â©la "spiritual" of which
only the words "Chain de Lion Down"
were allowed to be quite audible. They
were repeated often, and at each repe
tition of them he seemed profoundly,
34
though decorously, amused, In a way
which might have led to a conjecture
that the refrain bore some distant ref
erence to his master's eccentricity of
temper. At first he chuckled softly, but

Lion Down" burst Into outright laugh
ter.
"Honey, my Law!" he â  .claimed,
"But yo' pa de 'ceivin'dest man! He
mighty proud er you!"
"Proud of me!" She turned to him
in astonishment.
Nelson's laughter Increased- "Hain't
he Jass de 'celvln'dest man! Yessuh,
he de sot-uppest man in dis town
Vc-unt what you done night. What
he say dis mawn*. dat Jass his way!"
"Ah. no!" said Betty, 6adly.
"Yes'm! He proud er you, but he

God. I ain't keerin'. He weren't mad
at me. no ir.o'n' he were at you. He
Jass mad!"
Miss Betty looked at the old fellow
keenly. He remained, however, appar
ently unconscious of her scrutiny, and
occupied himself with preparations for
removing the tray.
"Nelson, what is the quarrel be
tween my father and Mr. Vanrevel?"
He had lifted the tray, but set it
down precipitately, bending upon her a
surprised and sobered countenance.
"Missy," he said, gravely, "dey big
trouble 'twlx* dem two."
"I know," she returned quietly.
"What is it?"
"Wha* fo* you ax me, Missy?"
"Because you're the only one I can
ask. I don't know any one here well
enough, except you."
Nelson's lips puckered solemnly.
"Mlsf Vanrevel vote Whig; but he
ag'in Texas."
â¢Well, what if he Is?"
"Yo* pa mighty strong fo' Texas."
'Is that all?"
"No'm. dat ain't hardly de beginnin'.

'â¢Well? Won't you tell me?"

man's gravity gave way to his enjoy
ment of the recollection, and he threw
back his head to laugh. "He sho' did,
honey! Uhuh! Ho. ho. ho! He sho'
did, honey, he sho* did!"
Nevertheless, as he lifted the tray
again and crossed the room to go, his
solemnity returned. "Missy." he said
earnestly, "ef dat young gelmun fall
in love wid you, w'lch I knows he will
ef he ketch sight er you, lemme say dis,
an* please fo' to ba'h in mine; better

"Nelson, was that all the quarrel be
tween* them?"
"Blessed Mussy! aln' dat enough? Ef
dey's any mo' I ain' hearn what dat
part were," he answered quickly, but
with a dogged tightening of the lips
which convinced Miss Betty that he
knew very well.
"Nelson, what was the rest of it?"
"Please, Missy, I got pack yo' pa
trunk; an' it time long ago fer me to be
at my wu'k." He was half out of the
door.
"What was the rest of it?" she re
peated Quietly.
"Now, honey," he returned with a de
precatory shake of his head, "I got my
wu'k 'tend to; an' I ain't nevah ax no
body what 'twas, an' I ain't goin* ax

Dey had hard 'nough time las' night

young gelmun 'way fum heah!"
"He came home with me last night,
Nelson; I told father so."
"Yes'm. Yo' pa tole me you say dat,
but he reckon you done it to mek him
madder, "case you mad, too. He say
he done see dat Crailey Gray comin"
'long de hedge wid you."
"He was mistaken, it was Mr. Van
revel."
Nelson rolled his eyes fervently to
heaven. "Den dat yoifng man run
pintedly on he death! Ef you want
keep us all dis side er de Jawdan
Rivuh, don' let him set foot in dis
neighbo'hood when yo' pa come back!
An', honeyâ" his voice sank to a pene
trating whisperâ "fo* I do a lick er
wu'k I goin' out in de stable an' git
down on my knees an' retu'n thanks
giving to de good God 'case he hole
Carewe street in de darkness las'
night!"
This was the speech he chose for his
exit, but, after closing the door behind
him. he opened it again, and said,
cheerfully:
"Soon's I git de trunk fix f* yo' pa, I
bring 'roun' dat bay colt wid de side
saddle. You better set 'bout gittin' on
yo 1 rldln'-habit. Missy. De roads is
mighty good dis sunshiny wedduh."
"Nelson?"
"Yes'm."
"Do you think such " an attack as
father had this morningâis.âdanger
ous?"
He had hoped for another chance to
laugh violently before he left her, and
this completely fitted his desire. "Ho,
ho. bo!" he shouted. "No'm, no. no,
honey! He Jass git so mad It mek him
sick. Yob couldn* kill dat man wid a
broad-ax. Missy!"
And he went down the hall leaving
the reverberations of his hilarity be
hind him. The purpose of his visit had
been effected, for, when Miss Betty ap
peared upon the horse-block in her
green habit and gauntlets, she was
smiling; so that only a woman â or a
wise old man â could have guessed that
she had wept bitterly that morning.
She cantered out to the flat open
country to the east, where she found
soft dirt roads that were good for the
bay colt's feet, and she reached a cross
road several miles "from town before
she was overcome by the conviction
that she was a wicked and ungrateful
girl. She could not place the exact
spot of her guilt, but she knew it was
there, somewhere, since she felt herself
a guilty thing.
For the picture which Nelson had
drawn rose before her; the one man
standing alone in his rage on the plat
form, overwhelmed by his calm young
adversary, beaten and made the butt
of laughter for a thousand. Her father
had been in the wrong in that quarrel,
and somehow she was sure, too, he
must have been wrong in the "per
sonal" one as well; the mysterious diffi
culty over Fanchon's Mr. Gray, who
had looked so ashamed last night.
What feud could they make over him,
of all people In the world? He* looked
strong enough to take care of his own
quarrels, even if he was so rigorously
bound by Fanchon's apron-strings
when it came to a word with another
girl.
But the conclusion that her father
had been in error did not lessen the
pathetic appeal of the solitary figure
facing the ridicule of the crowd. She
felt 'that "he always honestly believed
himself in the right; she knew that he
was vain; that he had an almost mon
strous conception of his dignity; and,
realizing the bitterness of that public
humiliation which he had undergone,
she understood the wrath, the unspeak
able pain and sense of outrage, which
must have possessed him.
And now she was letting him go forth
upon a Journeyâ his way beset with the
chances of illness and accidentâ
whence he might never return; she was
letting him go without seeing him
again; letting him go with no word of
farewell from his daughter. In brief,
she was a wicked girl. She turned the
colt's head abruptly to the west and
touched his flanks with her whip.
So it fell out that as the packet
foamed its passage backward from Ca
rewe's wharf into the current, the own
er of the boat, standing upon the hur
ricane deck, heard a cry from th shore,
and turned to behold his daughter dash
down to the very end of the wharf
on the well-lathered colt. Miss Betty's
hair was blown about her face; her
cheeks were rosy, her eager eyes
sparkling from more than the hard
riding.
"Papa!" she cried, "I'm sorry!"
She leaned forward out of the saddle,
THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALL.
extending her arms to him appeallngly
in a charming gesture, and, absolutely
ignoring the idlers on the wharf and
the passengers on the steamer, was
singly intent upon the tall figure on
the hurricane-deck. "Papaâ good-by.
Please forgive me!"
"By the Almighty, but that's a fine
woman!" said the captain of the boat
to a passenger from Rouen. "Is she
his daughter?"
"Please forgive me!" the clear voice
came again, with its quaver of en
treaty, across the widening water: and
then, as Mr. Carewe made no sign, by
word or movement, of hearing her, and
stood without the slightest alteration
of his attitude, she cried to him once
more: 'W&'z
"Good-by!"
The paddle-wheels reversed; the boat
swung down the river, Mr. Carewe
still standing immovable on the hurri
cane-deck, while, to the gaze of those
on the steamer, the figure on the bay
colt at the end of the wharf began to
grow smaller and smaller. She was
waving her handkerchief in farewell,
and they could see the little white
speck in the distance, dimmer arid
dimmer, yet fluttering still as they
passed out of sight round the j bend
nearly three-quarters of a mile below.
CHAPTER IX.
THE RULE OF THE REGENT.
Betty never forgot her first sight of
the old friend of her .family. Return
ing with a sad heart, she was walking
the colt slowly through the carriage
gates, when an extravagantly stout
lady, in green muslin illustrated with
huge red flowers, . came out upon the
porch and waved a fat arm to the girl.
The visitor wore a dark green turban
and a Cashmere shawl, while the ex
panse of her skirts was. nothing short of
magnificent; some cathedral dome
seemed to have been misplaced and the
lady dropped into it. Her outstretched
hand terrified Betty; how was she to
approach near enough to take It?
Mrs. Tanberry was about sixty,
looked fortv, and at first sight you
might have guessed she weighed nearly
three hundred, but the lightness of her
smile and the actual buoyancy which
she somehow Imparted to her whole
dominion lessened that by at least a
hundred-weight. She ballooned out to
the horse-block with a billowy rush
somewhere between bounding and soar
ing; and Miss Betty slid down from the
colt, who shied violently, to find her
self enveloped, in spjte of the dome, In
a vast surf of green and red muslin.
"My charming girl!" exclaimed the
lady vehemently, in a voice of such
husky richness, of such merriment and
unction of delight, that it fell upon Miss
Betty's ear with more' of the quality of
sheer gayety than any she had ever
heard. "Beautiful child! What a
beautiful child you are!"
She kissed the girl resoundingly on
both cheeks; stepped back from her
and laughed and clapped her fat
hands, which were covered with flash;
ing rings. "Oh, but you are a true blue
beauty! You're a princess! I am Mrs.
Tanberryâ Jane Tanberryâ young Janie
Tanberry. I haven't seen you since
you were a baby and your pretty moth
er was a girl like us!"
"You are so kind to come," said
Betty, hesitatingly. "I shall try to be
very obedient."
"Obedient!" Mrs. Tanberry uttered
the word with a shriek. "You'll do
nothing of the kind.' I am the light
mlndedest woman In the universe, and
any one who obeyed me would be em
broiled in everlasting trouble every sec
ond in the day. You'll find that I am
the one that needs looking after, my
charmer!"
She tapped Miss Betty's cheek with
her jeweled fingers as the two
mounted the veranda steps. "It will be
worry enough for you to obey yourself;
a body sees that at the first blush. You
have conscience in your forehead and
.rebellion in your chin. Ha, h*a, ha!"
Here Mrs. Tanberry sat upon and oblit
erated a large chair. Miss Carewe tak
ing a stool at her knee.
"People of our age oughtn't to be
bothered with obeying; there'll be time
enough for that when we get old and
can't enjoy anything. Ha, ha!"
Mrs. Tanberry punctuated her obser
vations with short volleys of husky
laughter, so abrupt In both discharge
and cessation that, until Miss Betty be
came accustomed to the habit, she was
apt to start slightly at each salvo. "I
had a husbandâ once," the lady re
sumed, "but only once, my friend! He
had Ideas like your father'sâ your
father is such an imbecile!â and he
thought that wives, sisters, daughters,
and such like ought to be obedient;
that is, the rest of the world was wrong
unless It was right; and right was Just
his own little, teeny-squeeny preju
dices and emotions dressed up for a
crazy masquerade as facts. Poor man!
He only lasted about a year!" And
Mrs.' Tanberry laughed heartily.
"They have been at me time and
again to take another." She lowered
ner voice and leaned toward Betty con
fidentially. "Not I! I'd be willing to
engage myself to Cralley Gray (though
Cralley hasn't got round to me yet),
for I don't mind Just being engaged, my
dear; but they'll have to invent some
thing better than a man before I
marry any one of 'em again! But I
love 'em. I do, the charming Billies!
And you'll see how they follow me!"
She patted the girl's shoulder, her
small eyes beaming quizzically. "We'll
have the gayest house in Rouen, lady
bird! The young men all go to the Ba
reauds'. but they'll come here now, and
we'll have the Bareauds along with 'em.
I've been away a long time, just fin
ished unpacking* yesterday night when
your father came in after the fireâ
Whoo! what a state he, was in with that
devilish temper of his!. Didn't I snap
him up when he asked me to come and
stay with you? Ha, ha! I'd have
come even if you hadn't been beautiful:
but I was wild to be your playmate, for
I'd heard nothing but 'Miss Betty Ca
rewe, Miss Betty Carewe' from every
body I saw, since the minute my stage
came in. You set 'em all mad at your
ball, and I knew we'd make a glorious
house-full, you and I! Some of the
vagabonds will turn up this very even
ing, you'll see if they, don't. Ha, ha!.
The way they follow me!"
Mrs. Tanberry was irresistible; she
filled the whole place otherwise than by
the mere material voluminousnesa of
her; bubbling over with froth of non
sense which flew through the house,
driven by her. energy, like sea-foam on
a spring gale, and the day, so discord
antly begun for Miss Betty, grew musi
cal with her own laughter, answering
the husky staccato of the vivacious
newcomer. Nelson waited upon them
at table, radiant, his smile like the
keyboard of a surreptitious double
shuffle and followed by the cachinna
ting echoes of the vain Mamie's recep
tion of the visitor's sallies, which Nel
son hastily retailed in passing.
Nor was Mrs.Tanberry's prediction al
lowed to go unfilled regarding the ad
vent of those persons whom she had
designated as vagabonds. It may have
been out of deference to Mr. Carewe's
sense of decorum (or from a cautious
regard of what he ' was liable to do
when he considered that sense out
raged) that the gallants of Rouen had
placed themselves under the severe re
straint of allowing three days to
elapse after their Introduction to Miss
Carewe before they "paid their re
spects at the house"; but. be that as It
may, the dictator was now safely un
der way down the Rouen River, and
Mrs. Tanberry reigned In his stead.
Thus, at about 8 o'clock that evening,
the two ladies sat in the library en
gaged in conversationâ though, for the
sake of accuracy, It should be said that
Mrs. Tanberry was engaged In conver
sation, Miss Betty in giving earâ when
their attention was arrested by sounds
of a somewhat musical nature from the
lawn, which sounds were immediately
identified as emanating from a flute
and violin.
Mrs. Tanberry bounded across the
room like a cyclone, and, dashing at
the candles, "Blow 'em out. blow 'em
out!" she exclaimed, suiting the action
to the word in a fluster of excitement.
"Why?" asked Miss Carewe, startled,
as she rose to her feet. The candles
were out before the question.
"Why!" repeated the merry, husky
voice In the darkness. "My goodness,
child precious, those vagabonds are
here! To think of your" never having
been serenaded before!"
She drew the girl to the window and
pointed to a group of dim figures near
the lilac bushes. "The dear, delightful
vagabonds!" she chuckled. "I knew
they'd come! It's the beautiful Tap
pingham Marsh with his fiddle, and
young Jeff Bareaud with his flute, and
'Gene Madrillon and little Frank Chen
oweth with thin "Will Cummlngs to
sing. Hark to the rascals!"
It is perfectly truthful to say that
the violin and flute executed the prel
ude, and then the trio sounded full on
the evening air, the more effective
chords obligingly drawn out as long as
the breath in the singers could hold
them In order to allow the two fair
auditors complete benefit of the har
mony. They sang "The Harp That
Once Thro' Tara's Halls," and followed
It with "Long, Long Ago."
"That," Mrs. Tanberry whispered, be
tween stifled gusts of almost uncon
trollable laughter, "is meant for Just
me!" < '
"Tell me the tales that to me were so
dear," entreated the trio.
"I told 'em plenty!" gurgled the en
livening widow. "And I expect be
tween us we can get up some more."
"Now you are come my grief is re
moved," they sang.
"They mean your father is on his
way to St. Louis," remarked Mrs. Tan
berry
Let me forget that so long you have
roved.
Let me believe that you love as you
loved,
Long, long ago, long: ago.
"Applaud, applaud!" whispered Mrs.
Tanbery, encouraging the minstrels by
a hearty clapping of hands.
Hereupon dissension arose among the
quintet, evidently a dispute in regard
to their next selection; one of the gen
tlemen appearing more than merely
to suggest a solo by himself, while the
others too frankly expressed adverse
opinions upon the value of the offering.
The argument became heated, and in
soite Of many a "Sh!" and "Not so
loud!" the Ill-suppressed voice of the
intending soloist, Mr. Chenoweth, could
be heard vehemently to exclaim: "I
will! I learned it especially for this oc
casion. I will sing it!"
His determination, patently, was not
to be balked without physical encoun
.ter, consequently he was permitted to
advance some â¢ paces from the lilac
bushes, where he delivered himself, in
an earnest and plaintive tenor, of the
following morbid Instructions, to which
the violin played an obi i gat o in tremolo,
so execrable, Â©nd so excruciatingly dis
cordant, that Mr. Chenoweth's subse
quent charge that It was done with a
deliberate evil intention could never be
. successfully opposed:
Go! Forget me! Why should Sorrow
O'er that brow a shadow fling?
Go! Forget me, and, to-morrow.
Brightly smile and sweetly sing!
Smile! tho' I may not be near thee;
Smile! tho' I may never see thee;
May thy soul with pleasure shine
Lasting as this gloom of mine!
Mis Carewe complied at once with
the request; while her companion, un
able to stop with the slight expression
of pleasure demanded by the songster,
threw herself upon a sofa and gave way
to the mirth that consumed her.
Then the candles were relit, the sere
naders invited within; Nelson bearing
cake and wine and the house was made
merry. Presently, the rom Virginia
Bareaud, making her appearance on
the arm of General Trumble, Mrs. Tan
berry led them all in a hearty game of
blind-man's bluff, followed by as hearty
a dancing of Dan Tucker. After that
a quadrtle being proposed. Mrs. Tan
berry suggested that Jefferson should
run home and bring Fa'nchon for the
fourth lady. However, Virginia ex
plained that she had endeavored to
persuade both her sister and Mr. Gray
to accompany the general and herself,
but that Mr. Gray had complained of
Indisposition, having suffered greatly
from headache on account of inhaling
so much smoke at the warehouse fire;
and, of course Fanchon would not
leave him. (Miss Carewe permitted
herself the slightest shrug of the
shoulders.) â¢
So they danced the quadrille with Jef
ferson at the piano, and Mr. Marsh
performing in the character of a lady,
a proceeding most unacceptable to the
general, whom Mrs. Tanberry forced to
be his partner. And thus the evening
passed gayly away, and but too quick
ly, to join the ghosts of all the other
evenings since time began; and each of
the little company had added a cheerful
sprite to the long row of these varied
shades that the after years bring to re
visit *us, so many with pathetic re
proach, so many bearing a tragic bur
den of faces that we cannot make even
to weep again, and so few with simple
merriment and liehtheart<Â»dness. Tap
pingham Marsh spoke the truth, indeed,
when he exclaimed in parting, "O rare
Mrs. .Tanberry!"
But the house had not done with sere
nades that night. The guests had long
since departed; the windows were still
and dark under the wan old moon,
which had risen lamely, looking unfa
miliar and not half itself; the air bore
an odor of lateness, and nothing moved;
when a delicate harmony stole out of
the -shadows beyond the misty garden.
Low but resonant chords sounded on
the heavier strings of a guitar, while
above them, upon the lighter wires,
rippled a slender, tinkling melody that
wooed the slumberer to a delicious
half wakefulness, as dreamily, as ten
derly, as the croon of rain on the roof
soothes a child to sleep. Under the ar
tist's cunning totich the instrument was
both" the accompaniment and the song;
and Miss Betty, at . first taking the
music to be a wandering thread in the
fabric of her own bright dreams, drifted
gradually to consciousness to find her
self smiling. Her eyes opened wide, but
half closed again with the ineffable
sweetness of the sound.
Then a voice was heard, eerily low,
yet gallant and clear, a vibrant bari
tone, singing to the guitar.
My lady's hair.
That dark delight.
Is both as fair
And dusk as night.
I know some lovelorn hearts that beat
In time to moonbeam twinklings fleet.
That dance and glance lIKe Jewels there.
Emblazoning: the raven hair!
Ah. raven hair!.
So dark and bright.
What loves lie there
â¢ Enmeshed, to-night?
I know some sighing lads that say
Their hearts were snared and torn away;
And now as pearls one fate they share.
Entangled In the raven hair.
Ah, raven hair.
For such a plight
Could you not spare
One acolyte?
I know a broken heart that went
To serve you but as ornament.
Alas! a ruby now you wear.
Ensanguining the raven hair!
The song had grown fainter and
fainter, the singer moving away as he
sang, and the last lines were almost in
audible In the distance. The guitar
could be heard for a moment or two
more, then silence came again. .It was
broken by a rustling in the room next
to Miss Betty's, and Mrs. Tanberry
called softly through the open door:
"Princess, are you awake? Did you
hear that serenade?"
After a pause the answer came hesi
tatingly in a small, faltering voice:
"Yesâ if It was one. I thotfght perhaps
he was only singing as he passed along
the street."
"Aha!" ejaculated Mrs. Tanberry, ab
ruptly, as though she had made an un
expected discovery. "You knew better;
and this was a serenade that you did
not laugh at. Beautiful, I wouldn't let
it ko any farther, even while your
father is gone. Something might occur
that would bring him home without
â¢ .rningâ such things have happened.
Tom Vanrevel ought to be kept far
away from this house."
"Oh, it was not he," returned Miss
Betty, quickly. "It was Mr. Gray.
Didn't you "
"My dear," Interrupted the other.
"Cralley Gray's specialty Is talking.
Most of the vagabonds can sing and
play a bit, and so can Crailey, particu
larly when he's had a few bowls of
punch; but when Tom Vanrevel touches
the guitar and lifts up his voice to
sing, there isn't an angel in heaven
that wouldn't quit the place and come
to hear him! Cralley wrote those words
to Virginia Barf aud. (Her hair Is even
darker than yours, you know.) That
was when he was being engaged to her;
and Tom must have set the music to
'em lately, and now comes here sing
ing 'em to you; anJ well enough they
fit you! But you must keep him away,
Princess." \
Nevertheless, Betty knew the voice
was not that which had bid her look
to the stars, and she remained con
vinced that it belonged to Mr. Crailey
Gray, who had been too ill, a few
hours earlier, to leave the Bareaud
house, and now with Fanchon's kisses
on his lips, came stealing into her gar
den and sang to her a song he had
made for another girl!
And the angels would leave heaven to
listen when he sang, would -they? Poor
Fanchon! No wonder she held him so
tightly in leading strings! He might
risk his life all he wished at the end of
a grappling-ladder, dangling In a fiery
cloud above nothing; but when it came
toâ ah, well, poor Fanchon! Did she in
vent the headaches for him, or did she
make him Invent them for himself? -
If there was one person in the world
whom Miss Betty held In bitter con
tempt and scorn. It was the owner of
that voice and that guitar.
CHAPTER X.
More than three gentlemen of Rouen
wore their hearts In their eyes for any
fool to gaze upon: but three was the
number of those who told their love be
fore the end of the first week of Mr. Ca
rewe's absence, and told it in spite of
Mrs. Tanberry's utmost effort to pre
serve, at all times, a conjunction be
tween herself and Miss Betty. For the
good lady, foreseeing these declarations
much more surely than dial the subject
of them, wished to spare her lovely
charge the pain of listening to them.
Miss Carewe honored each of the
lorn three with a few minutes of grav
ity; but the gentle refusal prevented
never a swain from being as truly her
follower as before: not that she re
sorted to the Door device of half-dis
missal, the every-day method of the
school-girl flirt, who thus keeps the lads
in dalliance, but because, even for the
rejected, it was a delight to be near her.
For that matter, it Is said that no one
ever had enough of the mere looking at
her. Also, her talk was enlivening even
to the lively, being spiced with sur
prising turns and amiably seasoned
with the art of badlnaee. To use the
phrase of the time, she possessed the
accomplishments, an antiquated charm
now on the point of disappearing, so
carefully has it been snubbed under
whenever exhibited. The pursuing
wraith of the young, it comes to sit. a
ghost at every banquet, driving the
flower of our youth to unheard-of exer
tions in search of escape, to dubious
diplomacy, to dismal inaction, or to
wine; yet time was when they set their
hearts on "the accomplishments.'*
Miss Betty Carewe at her harp, ah!
It was a dainty picture; the clear pro
file, with the dark hair low across the
temple silhouetted duskily In the cool,
shadowy room, against the open win
dow; the slender figure, one arm curv
ing between you and the strings, the
other gleaming behind them: the deli
cate little sandal stealing from the
white froth of silk and lace to caress
thÂ« pedal: the nimble hands fluttering ,
across the long strands, "Like white
blossoms borne on slanting lines of '
rain;" and the great gold harp rising
to catch a lavelln of sunshine that
pierced the vines at the window where
the honeysuckles swung their skirts to
the refrainâ it was a picture to return
many a long year afterward, and thrill
the reveries of old men who were then
young. And, following the light cas
cading ripples of the harp, when h<Â»r
low contralto lifted In one of the "old
songs." she often turned Inquiringly to
see if the listener liked music, and her
brilliant, dark eyes would rest on his
with an appeal that blinded his en
tranced soul. She meant It for the
mere indication of a friendly wish to*
suit his tastes, but It looked like the
divine humility of love. Nobody won
dered that General Trumble should fall
to verse-making in his old age.
She sketched magnificently. This is
the very strongest support for the as
sertion: Frank Chenoweth and Tap
pingham Marsh agreed, with tears of
enthusiasm, that "magnificently" was
the only word. They came to this con
clusion as they sat together at the end
of a long dinner (at which very little
had been eaten) after a day's picnic
by the river. Miss Carewe had been of
their company, and Tappingham and
Chenoweth found each his opportunity
in the afternoon. The party was small,
and no one had been able to effect a
total unconsciousness of the maneuvers
of the two young gentlemen. Even
Fanchon Bareaud comprehended lan
guidly, though she was more blurred
than ever, and her far-away eyes be
lled the mechanical vivacity of her
manner, for Cralley was thirty miles
down the river, with a fishing-rod
neatly packed In a leather case.
Mr. Vanrevel, of course, was not In
vited; no one would have thought of
asking him to Join a small party of
which Robert Carewe's daughter was
to be a memeber. But it was happiness
enough for Tom, that night, to He hid
den In the shrubbery, looking up at the
stars between the leaves, while he lis
tened to her harp, and borne through
the open window on enchanted airs, the
voice of Elizabeth Carewe singing
"Robin Adair." *
It was now that the town Indulged Its
liveliest spirit: never an evening lacked
Its junketing, while the happy folk of
Rouen set the early summer to music.
Serenade, dance and song for them, the
light hearts, young and old, making gay
together! It was all laughter, either In
sunshine or * by candle-light, undis
turbed by the far thunder below the
southern horizon, where Zachary Tay
lor had pitched his tent, upon the Rio
Grande.
One fair evening, soon after that ex
cursion which had proved fatal to the
hopes of the handsc ie Tappingham
and of the youthful Chenoweth. it was
the privilege of Mr. Thomas Vanrevel
to assist Miss Carewe and her chaperon
from their carriage, as they drove up
to a dance at the Bareauds'. This good
fortune fell only to great deserving, for
he had spent an hour lurking outside
the house in the hope of performing
such offices for them.
Heaven was in his soul and the
breath departed out of his body, when,
after a moment of hesitation. Miss
Betty's little lace-gauntleted glove was
placed in his hand, and her white slip
per shimmered out from the lilac
flounces of her dress to fall like a bene
diction he thought, on each of the car
riage-steps.
It was the age of' garlands; they
wreathed the Muses, the Seasons, and
their speech, so the women wo're
wreaths in their hair, and Miss Betty's
that night was of marguerites. "Read
your fortune in them all," whispered
Tom's heart, "and of whomsoever you
wish to learn, .every petal will say 'He
loves you'; none declare, 'He loves you"
not!* "
She bowed slightly but did not speak
to him, which was perhaps a better re
ception than that accorded the young
man by her companion.

cha.se. There was not perhaps a man
âan eligib;e manâ who had not made
love to her or who had not attempted
it. But she had ltd them on. and then
âhad sent them off. They went. There
was too much humor in Miss Betty,
too much of wit and laughter to make
them essay a second-time proposal,
one by one they stood rejected. Miss
B*tty would merely toss her youthful
heaci, and laugh, and laugh, and laugh.
TÂ«Tv of them, however, would not
down. Mr. John Masterson was one
and Tommy McClenahan was the
ether. Masierson clung to her with
a bulldog tenacity; he did It because
he had many of the characteristics of
the bulldog:. Miss Betty would laugh
at Masterson until he began to growl,
and then she would watch him rase
and storm with wide-open eyes.
"Do that again." she would suggest.
And Masterson would do It- He
couldn't help it. He gnashed his teeth
* jth rage. But he always came back-
Tommy McClenahan didn't cling to
Miss Betty. He simply followed her
about, watching her with frank, hon

hadn't a ghost of a show at that, but
Tommy let her run until she wa3

sprang to her side, and obeying a sud

Ordinarily he would not have dared
to do this. But there was something
about Miss Betty"* color, and her
srtrkllcg eyes, that Just made Tommy

"Iâ I couldn't help it," he gasped.
And then he stopped. For she was
looking straight into his eyes with an
expression that he had never seen be

"Bettyâ Bettyâ Betty." he implored.
"I've asked you now for the fifteenth

Miss Betty drew herself away. She

The town of Frankfort Plains was

Frankfort Plains was a fashionable

I OBl^P^Â«W Brt" to De greeted as
pV ' ' a nephew by the
|j KZ jjgessahH9 stern-featured old
zn&n In the puffln* automobile.
"Come here, you young rascal," the
eld man almost shouted as the auto
znobile drew up to the sidewalk.
Without knowing why, Ogden went.
Perhaps It was curiosity, perhaps It
was because he did not happen to
thick of anything else to do. At any
rate, he stepped up to the automobile
and took a good long look at Its occu
pant.
"Get In her* at once," said the old
man.
'"Why?" asked Ocj? n.
"Why?" repeated the old man. "Be
cause I tell you to do so. Here I have
been looking for you for the past two
â weeks and now you want to run away
â¢when x find you. That is a pretty way
for an only nephew to treat his uncle!"
"So you are my uncle?" said Ogden,
quizzically. Then the spirit of adven
ture, which had been his guiding star
all his life. 6eized possession of him and
he stepped into the vehicle, which
started, puffing, down the avenue to
ward Washington square.
On the way down he puzzled with
â himself as to the part which he was
acting or rather being forced to act. As
nearly as he could gather from the
conversation of the old man, he was
his nephew Rodney. The last name
had not been introduced into the con
versation. Rodney seemed to have
come from the West for a visit and to
havÂ« left the house without warning,
after a more or less violent quarrel
with his uncle.
"What did you want to run away
for, you young rascal? The girl is cer
tainly as pretty a cirl as you will find
ln the whole country, sir. It was only
to be expected that she should show
some coquetry about accepting you,
but I am surprised that any nephew of
mine would be such a fool as to run
away from a pretty girl. Why did you
do It, sir?" The old gentleman was very
irate.
Taking his cue from the fragmentary
information furnished him by these re
marks, Ogden, resolved to carry
through the comedy, straightened hlm-
Eelf up and remarked, with his most
dignified air:
"Because I trust that I am too much
of a gentleman to force my attentions
in any quarter where they are not
wanted."
He had read this sentence in some
old-fashioned book and thought it
might' go well with his elderly uncle.
The old fellow looked rather pleased
and said:
"I should have understood it, my
boy. The sentiment does credit to your
blood and your breeding, sir. But my
heart is set on this match. Just t 11
the girl you won't take 'No' for an an
swer and she will come around in time.
Eh, Gad. sir, when I was ;-our age I
would have been delighted with the co
quetries she has used on you."
By this time the automobile had
come to a stop in front of one of the
old houses along the north side of the
square and the two passengers alighted.
Entering the house the old man, with
Rodney in tow, made for the drawing
room, where they could hear some one
playing on* the piano. The room was
rather dark, but as they entered the'
light was good enough for Rodney to
make out the uncommonly pretty girl
seated at the piano. She got up uastily
as they entered the room and ran to
greet the old man. Then she turned to
Ogden and said:
"Soj^-ou have come back. Cousin
Rodnfr? 'I was under the impression
that you had left the city."
Feeling rather ashamed of himself
for carrying on the deception, but over
powered by the desire for adventure,
Ogden sat down and joined In the con
versation, fencing carefully for time
whenever he was asked a question the
answer to which might betray his Iden
tity. Whenever he. got a chance he
stoU a glance at the girl. He fancied
once or twice that he detected a flicker
of amusement upon her face. She was
evidently watching him, narrowly, and
the conviction grew upon him that she
suspected he was an Impostor. The
girl was certainly a beauty and he
could not understand why the real Rod
ney had been callous enough to run
away from her society)- even if he had
found his presence more or less unwel
come.
By and by the old rentleman ex
cused himself upon the plea that he
must take his regular afternoon nap,
and left the two young people alone.
The moment he was , safely out of
hearing the girl broke into a peal of
laughter and said:
"Did you think he fooled me?"
She was taking it very nicely,
thought Ogden, and he braced him
self up enough to say:
"No, I knew you recognized my im
position. But, believe me, I am not
an intentional impostor. Tour uncle
picked me up on the street and swore
up and down that I was his nephew.
It would not have been proper to ac
cuse him of falsehood, so I just came
along."
The girl grew serious and said:
"You know uncle is a bit nearsight
ed, and he will not, under any circum
stances, consent to wear glasses. You
do look wonderfully like his nephew.
But don't you know who you are sup
posed to be?"
"No more idea than the man In the
moon," asseverated * Ogden, solemnly.
"Why, you are supposed to be Rod
ney Phillips. You know him, don't
you?"
"Rodney Phillips! No, I don't be
lieve I do. But stop. Why, 'Chesty*
Phillips that I used to room with at
Yale. , His right name was Rodney,
but no one ever called him by that
name. So that explains the resem-

cash DrUe to the team that won the
football game in the country fair tour
nament. There was never any restric
tion as to what teams should compete,
but as the Wayside could lick any
thing in the county except the Frank
fort, and as the Frankfort could lick
the Wayside, there was little doubt
which teams would play. And there
was little doubt also which team would
win. In the midst of the preparation
for the fair Mr. John Masterson- had
proposed to Miss Betty Pennlngton for
the thirteenth time, and- Tommy had
proposed' , for , the. fifteenth time; and
her ultimatum had gone forth.
Now it is just as well to state right
here that Miss Betty had a small broth
er who hated Mr. Masterson, and who
was a crony of Tommy McCIenahan's,
and that this small brother carried to
the latter all the news he gathered
during the course of jche days and
weeks. This may or may not have some
bearing on the case.
McClenahan got his team out and
had them in practice at every avail
able hour of the day. He had to do
the best he could. He could. not tell
them why; but they worked, for they
were after the $1000 and the applause
of the community. They worked.
Masterson. on the contrary, gave his
team a rest. Everybody wondered
why, but Masterson was czar, and
they left him alone. Now, Masterson
was the graduate of a college whose
name is a household wordâ a college/'
which battles with another college ony

which battle hangs the interest bf mil

the "Two Dromios.' "
"Yes," said the girl, laughing heart
ily, "and you are Ogden Harwood.
Cousin Rodney has shown me pic
tures of you a dozen times and com
mented on the resemblance."/.; .?.
"But tell me," interupted Ogden,
"why did Rodney run away from
you?" â¢
"Because he is engaged to a very
dear friend of mine and uncle won't
hear of his marrying any one but me.
Rodney hasn't a cent except his slen
der salary and the allowance uncle
makes him, so he has to dissemble."
"I would like very much to see the
girl Rodney is engaged to," said Off
den.
"And why?" asked the rlrl.
"She must be very beautiful, in
deed." \\-ii
"How do you know?"
"Is it proper to pay compliments
upon short acquaintance?"
"You may answer my question when
you have known me longer."
"Thanks, since that .means you are
not going to cut me when next we
meet."
"But you -had better leave before
uncle comes down from his nap."
"And when can I be properly Intro
duced to you?"
"Didn't you know Raymond Pearson
at Yale?"
"Yes. but why?"
"He Is to be married to a friend of
mine next week, and I am to be the
maid of honor. Can't you get him to
invite you?" ',
"I am In town to be his beit man.'*.
."What a coincidence! But you must
go now." .,'â¢â¢â 
"All right. Then I'll Just say au
revolr until we are properly intro
duced."
"Yes, au revolr, until the rehearsal
of the ceremony next Tuesday."
And Ogden was down the "steps and
into the j street, conscious of the 2 fact
that\ he was looking forward, to -the
wedding of , his friend Pearson ..with
much more Interest than j even a best
man is supposed to take in such an
tasion. Masterson nunseiC hau once
redeemed it by kicking a goal from
the field. Masterson thought of this
college tsam which bowed to none
other than to its successful rival.
"All," muttered Masterson to him
self, "is fair in love." Then he wrote
a letter to the captain of the college
team:
"Send me one or two good men."
he wrote, "there's $1000 in it, and you
can have the bigger part of it. I am
working for something else, and I want
to win this game. McClenahan has a
new man or two that I'm afraid of. I
won't take chances." i V- â¢.
The president of the college club,
with an eye on the $1000, 'immediately
repliedâ and favorably, too. Master
son, who had been to this time some
what uncertain, now rubbed his hands
with glee. The day arrived â and the
hour. Miss Betty Pennington. with
sparkling eyes, wearing a composite
bouquet, made up of two sent to her
by Masterson and McClenahan. was
seated in the front row on the grand
stand. Masterson came out and looked
the field over, and waved at Miss Betty.

Consul, but . the State Department
never makes things worse by making
pubVc the man's shortcomings.
There could have been only one rea
son for appointing James Hartman as
Consul at San Escondido, which you
may imagine to be one of the South
American states. "Jim," as he was gen
erally called, had some influence In
State politics and had used it on the
right side. Socially he had no standing;
as a business man he was known to be
crafty and unprincipled. It was 'a third
rate appointment to a third-rate con
sulship, but it was good enough for Jim
Hartman. In fact, it was what he se
lected and pulled strings for.
Only three miles from San Escondido
were the mines of the American Mining
and Smelting Company, of which Hart
man was a large stockholder. Every
three or four months for several years
past there had been strikes and rowp,
and the feeling against the company
was widespread and bitter. This had
not extended to the consulate, as the
appointee had no business interest, but
Hartman had hardly taken t possession
of his office when he began using it as
as far as he could for the benefit of
the stockholders. There were many
ways in which he could and did favor
the company, and his position soon be
came generally known and increased
the bitter feeling. He realized it, but
defied public sentiment. So long as the
Secretary of State did not bring him
to book he did not care for what others
thought or said.
Jim Hartman had been Consul for
six months, dividing his time about
equally between Uncle Sam and the
American Company, and drawing an
income from both, when a new strike
leader came to the front. He was a
man who had traveled In the United
States and learned a thing or two.
For instance, , he had learned . that
throwing down tools and walking off
in a peaceful way seldom or never won
a Btrik'e. 5 There must be bitter
speechesâ defiance of â¢ authority- â de

"My Â£>etty." - he said to himself. Mc-
Clenahan did the same. The air was
filled with a vague unrest. The stands
were filled with strangers. There, was
an air of mystery abroad.
Suddenly a door where the Frank
fort men were tjuaxtered opened and
eleven men filed out. clothed in the
Frankfort colors. As they came
across the field there was a gasp from
the ignorant, and an uproarious laugh
from the knowing. Suddenly a. man
on the stand stood u?> and shouted.
"Helmstaedter." he cried. "Helni
staedter!" Everybody looked and then
huzza'd. For the first man of the
team was none othrr than the famous
quarterback of Missterson's alma ma

died down when a dozen men in the

with excitement. "Rah! Rah! Rah!

they yelled. And then everybody
knew. For not only Helmstaedter.
but every man in- the Frankfort team,
was none other than one of the rejru

It Is very Important, then, that hav
ing realized that the child Is an ani
mal with certain advantages over
other animals, the parents should
strive to make the child a strong ani
mal. But little will ever be accom
plished by most children unless care Is
taken to provide them with strong
bodies. To do this parents will need
give attention to a number of Impor
tant matters.
Parents should consider well quan
tity, quality and variety of food for
children. All needs should be deter
mined by the age of the child, as well
as by the time of taking, and the cli
mate. Some foods are of good use.
Others should never be taken save In
cold weather. Milk, lean flesh and the
whole wheat are those which will sus
tain life longest without change. " At
tention must also be given to the man
ner of eating. Another matter which
parents should watch is that of drink
ing too much at the table, as that Is a
habit which many children have. An
other important matter is the charac
ter and amount of clothing which it Is
best for children to wear. The ven
tilation both day and night, the impor
tance of light, regulation of the tem
perature of the house, character and
amount of exercise, sleep required, and
many similar matters, ara things
which the parents should keep In mind
and try to understand. Thus they may
the better help their children to de
velop strong bodies with which to fight
life's battles.
Some will be ready to say that it Is
too much trouble to study these things
for the purpose of helping their chil
dren. Many are willing to spend more
time on how to raise better pigs, or
finer dogs and cats, than In learning

erty, and this included Consul Hart
man. The laboring men of that State
would show the great United States
how they regarded her by chasing her
Consul at San Escondido from his of
fice and then hauling down and' tramp
ling upon the Stars and Stripes. His
plans were well laid, and a part of
them worked all right. That any of
the details miscarried was not his
fault, nor yet that of the Consul.
One morning Jim Hartman received
a visitor whose card- bore the inscrip
tion, "Thomas Holmes, Colorado, U.
S. A." Mr. Holmes was no gentleman.
That is, he explained that he had been
a prospector, laborer, miner and sev
eral oth^er things, and was even then
looking for something that might pay
him a couple of dollars per day until
he could get a new hold with his feet.
He had been landed from a steamer
with only $3 in cash in his pockets,
and the card he sent in was a writ
ten address in pencil. He was talking
with the Consul about the mines near
at hand and begging for a Job, when
the telephone; rang and the superin
tendent of the American said over the
wire:
"Hell broke loose here half an hour
ago. Men all went on a strike, and
are now destroying everything within
reach. When they get through here
they are going to march into town and
make it hot for you. Better vamose
at once."
"What's up?" asked Holmes of Colo
rado, as the Consul turned to him with
a pale face.
"Strike at the mines, and the fellows
are coming here to do me up."
"But you are the Consul."
"That won't play any part."
"But the American flag flies over
your head."
"They'll tear it down and drag it
through the gutters. I've got to get
out within five minutes if I want to
save my life."
"See here, man," said Mr. Holmes, as
the Consul walked about grabbing up
books and papers and storing them in
the vault, "it strikes me that you are
a fish worm instead of a man."
"What the devil yould you have me
do? Stay here and be torn to pieces
by a frenzied mob? There Is no sol
diery here to protect me, and when a
South American mob starts in to do"
violence it doesn't stop at anything.
These strikers will hang every Ameri
can in San Escondido. before noon."
"I'll bet dollars to cents they don't,"
was the sturdy reply. "So you propose
to evacuate the position before you are
attacked?"
"I propose to get out of this In the
next three minutes." ,
"Then Uncle Sam made a mistake in
sending you down here. Have you any
firearms around?"

word was uttered, however, until the
two teams began to line up. At that
Instant, however, the two teams gazed
into each other's faces, and tha
Quincetown team blanched and step
ped back. Then pandemonium broke
loose.
"'Yalevard! Yalevard! Yalevard!"
cried half a hundred strangers. The
whole stand arose and yelled. ' "YalÂ«
vard!" It cried. And then everybody
knew. For Tommy McClenahan had
been kept Informed of certain thins*
by Miss Betty's small brother, and
had profited accordingly. Tommy had
checkmated Masterson for sure.
And accordingly the Yalevard team
carried off its share of the $1000 and
a goodly portion of the gate receipts.
And as the Quincetown-Yalevard offi
cial game approaches. It is no wonder
that the odds have been fixed at 4 to 1
on Yalevard. For the Frankfort Plains
score was 36 to 0.
"You don't mean to say. Miss Betty.'*
said JAisterson. "that you would let
ycur marriage hang on the mere scon*

Miss Betty smiled. "All's fairâ"
she answered. "You asked me thirteen

how to bring up children. This seems
a pretty hard statement, but is it not
true? How few parents have given
Bystematic study to this most impor
tant problem? Drop into the nearest
library and you will find many volumes
devoted to the raising of dogs and sim
ilar matters. Search diligently and It
is doubtful If you will be able to find
a single book of practical suggestions
upon the management and training of
children. Had there been a demand
for such books the country would have
been flooded with them.- Think of it!
More Interest in developing the soul
less occupant of the pigpen than in un
folding precious human beings, mad*

the parents' peculiarities.
The best wealth any parent can give
a child Is health of mind and body.
Without It life must be a prolonged
misery. Woe to the parent who has
sown seeds of disease In his unborn
children. There may be some little ex
cuse for those who do not look care
fully after the health of those born
healthy. For others there can be none.
The child who starts with a strong
body has a hundred times better chanc*
of enjoying a happy and successful HfÂ»
than the child who has not a healthy
body. There are some few notable ex
ceptions, but they only prove the rule.
Health Is the first and perpetual condi
tion of success. How many of those
who have wealth would give It all for
the health enjoyed by tha poorest la
borer on the street! Tha great trouble
Is that, like other blessings. It bright
ens only as It takes Its flight. There
fore we are not apt to care for it until
It Is too late.
The child who wants health wants
everything. Give him health and moral
and Intellectual training, and you need
give him nothing else. Fall to give
him health and you can never make
up for the loss. Give him health and
no one will envy him the happiness It
brings.

fool to stay. They'll be here within
an hour, and If they don't hang you It'll
be because they'll tear you to pieces
first."
"Thank you." replied Mr. Holmes
as the Consul bolted out of the ofSce.
"but I'm going to stay right here and
keep Old Glory flapping in the morn
ing breeze. If any man can haul down
that flag while I'm on guard I'll quit
calling Denver, Colorado, my native
town."
The alarm began to spread through
the town. Stores and banks were
closed and many citizens left by any
conveyance they could secure. Mr.
Holmes had a dozen callers who ad
vised him to leave at once, but he sim
ply shook his head and went on barri
cading the doors and windows and
taking a loving glance at the old flag
now and then. He had an hour to
get ready in and It was plenty of time.
He sent word to the Mayor of ths
town that he would hurt some one if
attacked, and the Mayor replied that
he must fisht his own battle, and then
left town. At the end of an hour
SO0O men appeared with flags flying
and drums beating. There were 1000
men from tha mines, and tha others
were the riff-raff of the city and coun
try. -That gang meant mischief. It
had adopted the "American idea" for
the first time and it proposed to make
its power felt. A dozen citizens were
assaulted, fences broken down, stores
sacked and telephone poles torn down
to get up an appetite, and then the
leader steered them for the American
consulate. The mob screeched and
cheered and, rushed forward, expect
ing to have the building torn down in
five minutes.
"Now.^Ir.. Holmes of Colorado," said
the occupant to himself as he witnessed
the rush; and the Winchester spokÂ»
and a man dropped dead.
It spoke as fast as Mr. Holmes could
draw trigger, and at every report a
man went down. The mob had fire
arms and volleys were fired; it had
rocks and it showered them against
the building like hailstones. When tha
rifle was empty the magaalne was re
filled, and it was pop! pop! .pop! until
the mob finally turned and took to its
heels in a panic and left Old Glory still
waving. There was no return. A few
more stores were sacked and a few
more citizens cuffed about, and then
the "strike for freedom" was over. Mr.
Holmes from Colorado removed his
barricade in iue time and sauntered out
upon the public sc"ire and did eoma
counting.
"About twenty-five, as I make it." hÂ»
mused, "and half a dozen others must

The ambiguous words sounded un

her. She sank with more haste than

But in that instant of wireless teleg

mind to run, if not for her own life, for
that of her new lace hat, signaled the
conductor and got off the car.
Grasping the voluminous fluffery of
her silken skirts in both hands, she
po-ised for flight, when a deep voice

"We seem to be going the same way,

She put her little hand on his offered

and they set forth.
In that short walk he made himself
deferentially agreeable, and she, who
had been shut in from all contaminat

highly improper escapade with all the

1 \RT smithy, and the poem
R. Â£m'Tm\'Â£Z&L of Longfellow have
Invested the village blacksmith with an
atmosphere of poetry:
Under a i-preading chestnut tree the village
â n.lshy stands;
Tbe smith, a misnty man is he, with large
a:. a sinewy bands.
And thÂ« muscle* of his brawny arms are
fctron^ aÂ« Iron bands.
He is regarded as the king of all
trades, and the story that accounts for
hib diadem, as found in many English
counties, is as follows: On a certain
occasion a contest arose among the
tradesmen as to which trade was the
most^jiiportant of all and as to which
tradesman should be esteemed king.
The baker naid: "I ought to be king,
for I feed all." But tbe plowman said:
"Xay. that should be I, for I plow the
land for the corn, and without the corn
m. bread can be baked." Then said the
mason: "I must be king, for I pro
vide houses tor baker and plowman,
and for all." â  But the wagoner ex
claimed: "I should be king, for with
out me the corn would not be taken to
the mill, ncr would the mason have ma
terial wherewith to build."
"A fine set of fellows are you all!"
exclaimed the cobbler. "Unless I shod
you all none would be able to go about
his work, but would limp over the
countryâ cripples. " And the huntsman
declared: "Unless I shot down tbe
game all corn would be devoured, and
the tand would be incapable of main
taining mankind. I should be pro
claimed the king."
The blacksmith said nothing, but he
extinguished his fire and ceased to ply
his bellows.
Presently the baker came to him. "I
want a new pell for my oven," said he.
"1 will not give you one, unlees you
surrender your claims to me," said the
smith.
Next cam* the plowman. "I must
have a new share for my plow."
"That is right, but only if you recog
nize me as king will I provide It"
Then came tbe masons "Mr tools
need sharpening."
"Well enough," replied the smith:
"sharpened they shall be If you ac
knowledge me as king."
After that arrived the wagoner; bis
had drawn upon herself. His" brown
eyes were desperately pleading as he
closed the umbrella and stood beside
her under the" columned "shelter of "the
entrance way. i
"Oh. please go away," she implored
him, glancing apprehensively about,
and hurriedly fitting her key to the
lock, "some one, perhaps Sister Maria,
might see you."
"Not till you tell me when I may
horses needed to be shod. The black
smith consented to shoe them only on
condition that he abandoned his pre
tensions. Next arrived J,he~cobbler. He
required cl<mtÂ» for the boots and shoes
he made, and he wus supplied only on
the same conditions. The last to ap
pear was the huntsman. He must have
his gunlock repaired. "I will do itâ
but surrender your assumption of king
ship to me," said the smith. And so It
came to pass that all tradesmen were
forced to acknowledge the blacksmith
as king.
But the forge has furnished saints.
Baldomer of Lyons was one. Viventius,
Abbot of St. Just, going into the smithy
one day saw Baldomer. leaning on his
hammer engaged in prayer, and he en
tered into conversation with him. and
found that his knowledge of the Scrip
tures was so great that he Induced him
to enter his abbey. The gentleness of
Baldomer was so great that at meal
times he crumbled bread In his hand
and. holding it out of the window, the
wild birds came, full of trust, and
perched on his fingers. Then he would
say: "Eat. little birds; cat and sing
praises to the Lord." He died about
the year 6G0. i,..'."-.
But it Is St. Eligius who is regarded
as the patron of blacksmiths, but with
out much reason, for he was brought
up as a goldsmith and worked at en
amels. Clothalr II wanted a throne
made of precious metal, and. as he
could find no one else capable of under
taking thÂ«* task he confided it to Eli
gius. giving him at the same time the
metal necessary for making the throne.
Eligius found that he had enough
wherewith to make two seats. When
they were done he gav*Â» on* to the
king, who admired it. and ordered pay
ment to be mad* to the skillful work
man. Then Eligius produced the sec
ond throne. The king was so struck
with his honesty that hÂ» Immediately
advanced him to be master of the mint.
In art he is erroneously represented as
a farrier, with a horse's leg in his hand,

put It on again without' evil conse

Do any readers of the present day
know their Scott. In "Kenilworth"
the smith; Waylan'd, Is Introduced as
a chÂ«'iracter living in the times of.
Queen Elizabeth. But he belongs to a
remote antiquity. He is mentioned in
the Anglo-Saxon poem of Beowuulf of
the seventh or eighth century. But
we have to go to the Icelandic early
poetry to learn his story. There was
a King of Sweden who had- two sons
and a daughter; . he heard that a
skillful blacksmith lived in a hut at
no- great distance, so he â¢ went, to it
when the smith, whose name was
Wayland. was out, broke , open . his
cupboard and took from.it a. <. heavy
gold ring. This he gave to his daugh
ter. Then he had Waylan.d seized,
hamstrung, and condemned him to
forge swords and ornaments of precious
metal for himself. , .- .
Wayland was filled wlthvresentment
and resolved' on punishing., the' King.
He worked for some time diligently at
his forge, fashioying swords. -One day
the two Princes came : to visit it and
look at his work. Wayland seized them,
murdered them, cut off their: heads and
burned their bodies under his bellows.
Then he fashioned out of their, skulls
splendid cups, enchased in gold, which
he sent to the King, who, quite unsus
picious of what had become of his sons,
drank ale 'from these cups. Now Way
land's brother was a notable archer and
he killed many eagles, and he gave the
plumes to Wayland. who out of them
contrived a pair of wings.
On a certain day the Princess broke
her gold ring and she went to the forge
to have it repaired. - Wayland brutally
maltreated her, and then getting on his
wings flew to the top of a hedge that
surrounded the' residence, and from
there summoned the King and < re
hearsed to him all that he had done
and- then flew -far away.' â¢ â¢ .

There are three measures which the
Irish Nationalists have on their pro
gramme for Parliamentary action:
1. Amelioration of the condition of
Irish laborers.
. 2. Establishment of a Cathollo
university.
S. Home rule or legislative Indepen
dence.
Englishmen are now convinced of the
truth so often inculcated by Gladstone
that Irishmen are the best Judges of
what legislation is required for the good
of their country, and where It is de
manded by more than eighty out of Ire
land's 103 representatives In the House
of Commons English and Scotch mem
bers should not block the way. The
land acts, culminating in the Wyndham
act- creating a peasant ; proprietary,
while vastly benefiting well-to-do farm
ers, have not appreciably bettered the
condition of farming laborers and small
tenants, whose families furnished most
of the emigrants who . crowded the
steamers sailing for America.
Promises have for many years past
been 'given, both by Tory, and Liberal
governments, to establish a Catholic
university In Ireland which would sat
isfy the demands of the Catholics, who
constitute three-fourths of the popula
tion. They were made only to be
broken. The present Premier, Mr. Bal
four, has declared himself repeatedly
in favor of the proposition. Unlike the
United States, denominational educa
tion has the sanction and support of
the British Government In the three
kingdoms. Trinity College. Dublin, a
Protestant Institution, has enjoyed rich
revenues from the time of Queen Eliza
beth to the present. The Queen's Uni
versity in Belfast is to all intents and
purposes a Presbyterian college.
Branches of the same university in
Cork and Galway have been dismal
failures because, under the ban of the
Catholic hierarchy on account of their
Godless system of training. An Irish
Catholic university btll will rAet with
strenuous opposition from the same ele
ment which fought so bitterly the Lon
don education bill, recently passed by
a narrow. majority. The Cabinet will
tldlous taste, he sallied forth to a,
Madison-avenue car. Arriving at the
house whose fair dweller had haunted
his dreams, he rang the bell and wait
ed with his heart thumping so loud
under his stiff dress shirt that he won
dered if she could hear it In that sec
ond floor front room she had told
him was hers and which he had
watched every evening for a week In
hope of seeing even her shadow.
The door was opened by a trim
maid.
"Is â is Miss Anoline Dwight at
home?" he stammered in his excite
ment, fumbling in his card case.
The maid stared and then giggled,
but in a moment straightened her de
portment to its usual dignity.
"Yes. sir. I guess she's down stairs."
she remarked; then glancing doubt
fully at the bit of pasteboard. "Shall
I take this to 'er?" And the giggla
threatened to break bounds again.
"Certainly." responded Mr. Bewley
in his most lofty manner, though he
reddened visibly. What the deuce ailed
the girl, he wondered. Probably Miss
Dwight was at dinner â he hoped ha
had not come too early. He anxiously
consulted his watch. Nine o'clock
was not so late â a burst of laughter
from below, whither the servant had
repaired, startled his embarrassment
anew, and the words "Plug hat. too!"
floated up to him.
When she came back she was at no
pains to conceal her mirth. "Jes* step
this way. sir." she giggled, and he
followed her, much perturbed, to the
basement.
"Gen'le'man to see Miss Dwight."
she announced loudly, opening the
kitchen door with a flourish, and
abruptly withdrew to a back room,
whence muffled explosions of mirth Is
sued at intervals.
"To' wan' see me. suh?" A hug*.
black hulk in turban and white apnm
waddled toward him. "I's MlsÂ» An
erllne Dwizht â de cook ob dls yr
'stablishment."
On confronting this African appari
tion, Mr. Bewley stared, opened hiÂ»
mouth to speak, then fled. When he
emerged, wrathful, wretched, disap
pointed and humiliated, he went back
to the club and called himself all the
unpleasant names he could think of.
He arose the next morning with a lark.
â or what corresponds to It in this city,
the milk wagonsâ and delighted hia
employer by being first at the office.
Also for several mornings thereafter.
But a reward other than ofllclal ap
proval â cold comfort though it wasâ
awaited him a few days later, in the
form of a dainty blue note sealed with
white wax. It was from sister Maria,
as follows:
"My Dear Mr. Bewley: \ '
"Through a chance remark of one of
the servants to-day I was led to ques
tion my sister Nell concerning a hoax
she very unjustly played upon you the
other evening.
"Neil is very young and inexperi
enced, and I have tried to be father and
mother both to the orphan child; so I
write now to ask your pardon for her
impropriety and later rudeness to you.
"Your desire for further acquaint
ance, if you still cherish such, may
possibly be furthered, if you can find
a mutual friend through whom to re
ceive the usual formalities of an in
troduction.
"I beg to remain.
"Yours very truly,
"MARIA L. BROSTER."
Harry groaned in despair as he read.
How could he ever hope, among the
several millions who inhabited the Isl
and of Manhattan to find one who
knew Miss Nell Broster. The prover
bial needle in the haystack waa an
easy search as compared to this.
But a tiny penciled word at the bot
tom of the page caught his eye:
"(Over.)
He turned the page and with It
turned a new and joyful leaf In his life,
for it held all the sweetness of love'a
young dream. This is what he read:
"P. s.â Sister gave me this to ma.ll.
She has probably forgotten to aay. that
I was a roommate at boarding school
of your Mr. Bronson's niece and ward
Mabel. You go there every Saturday

bo divided upon the question. If thÂ«
Chancellor of the Exchequer. Mr.
Chamberlain, Inherits the political
views of his father he will be unalter
ably opposed to any denominational
grants unless the tip Is given by the
old man that he had better stand la for
the sake of the Irish vote.
The Secretary of War, Arnold To*
ter, represents a North of Ireland con
stituency which would harbor nÂ« klaa
feelings If he supported the) bill.
The third and greatest measure*
home rule, is one opposition to which
brought about the elevation to pswer
of the so-called Union part), a combi
nation of Tories and seceding Liberals,
prominent among whom were the Duke
of Devonshire and Joseph Chamberlain*
late members of the Cabinet. There Is.
however, a consensus of opinion among
all parties that a large -xtension of
self-government must be granted to
Ireland.
The obnoxious bureaucratic system
of government, with headquarters In
Dublin Castle, must be route I out and
the people given a voice In the admiry
lstrartlon of national affairs. In a let
ter written a few days ago to Coloi.el
John F Finnerty of Chicago, John
Redmond, leader of the Irish Parlia
mentary party, said: "No concessi i
of any sort on land, education taxa
tion or anything else, tc us by an/
English party or English Government
must be allowed to interfere with the
â \isorour prosecution of the movement
for the fr.lfllli. ent of Ireland's 'ust a-:
pirations for freedom. Every victory
won In the past has strengthened our
hand. To-day Ireland stands facing
the future with a confidence and
strength she never before possessed.
For my part, I honestly believe that
we can now raise so strong a move
ment as to make it comparatively easy
by taking advantage of the divisions
in the English parties and the growing
union which we all hope to see among
classes in Ireland to achieve home
rule." - .
The dancer ahead Is when Parlia
ment meets In February. The Govern
ment is in such a wobbly condition in
consequence of dissensions among the
leaders a dissolution may be precipi
tated without accomplishing anything.
It is generally understood that the
lately reconstructed Cabinet Is only a
stop gap affair.
The Standard, which is the recog
nized organ of the Tory party, sorrow
fully admits that the party is distract
ed, tossed upon a sea of opposing In
fluences and conflicting opinions. Bal
four is leaving nothing undone to
stave off the inevitable dissolution until
Chamberlain gets his mandate from
the voters to back down or go ahead
with his protection scheme.NEW LITERATURE OF THE YEAR
J. J. Belt Creates
Rare Mrs. McLerie
AMES JOY BELL., the young
I Scotch Journalist, is making hay
jj while it is vet his boon to bask
I !n the fleeting sunshine of popu-
J lar favor. "Wee Macgregor"
* made his name known about a
year ago then followed "Ethel." a
bright little tale which detracted noth
ing from hi* wen-earned reputation,
and now he gives us still a third. "Mrs.
M'Lerie.'" This la making hay with
a vengeance.
It Is evidently Mr. Ball's endcax-or to
revive the popular taste for the Scotch
burr which passed with Watson"s
"Bennie Briar Bush" and Barries
"Tommy" stories. Perhaps it is over
rash to say that the Scotch dialect
story has passed; it may bs true that
Bell's latest book clearly demonstrates
that the land o' cakes is with us yet.
It Is certain, however, that Drumtoch
ty. Thrums and all those places of
sainted memory had their distinct
vogue once and are not now the Mec
cas of the Caledonian votaries that
they were five years ago.
Mr. Ball works along precarious
trails. A story like "Wee Macgregor"
or "Mrs. M'Lerie" depends for Its suc
cess entirely upon the caprices of the
moment on the part of the. reading
world. This in the dia
lect story is a great chance; it may
make the author famous for the min
ute, but the glory is not for lonj. Ed
ward Townsend. who was ten years
ago an unknown reporter upon this
j<aper. suddenly flared into popularity
with "Chlmmie F&dden" and then went
out. Peter Dunne with his "Dooley"
had a great vogue for a time and then
the public left him. Not long ago a
certain Seumas MacMannus was filling
the magazines with Irish stories, but
now his name Is forgotten. Thus fare
the dialecticians. May the fates be
kinÂ«J to Mr. Bell.
"Mrs. M'Lerie" is distinctly a clever
bouk. It is a novel and brilliant
achievement out of the beaten paths of
literature. For those who are able to
enjoy delicate caricature and bubbling
mirth "Mrs. M'Lerie" will have an es
pecially strong appeal.
The author has chosen to reveal his
gadding old Scotch gammer out of her
own mouth and therefore he has cast
his little book entirely in dialogue. Mrs.
M'Lerie and her boon crony, Mrs.
Munro, sit over "dishes o' tea" and
babbie along delightfully about stuffed
birds, liver pills. Masonic societies or
church raffles. Mis. M'Lerie is so un
consciously ingenuous, Mrs, Muro so
quick to prompt and correct her friend
from the laughably lacking store of her
erudJUosC that the sum total of these
two auld wives' opinions upon things
and things is refreshingly humorous.
Yet beneath all the quaint humor and
the sly fun there js a little thread of
something solid, of a character picture
which makes a strong appeal to the
h<ait_ Not a. crocbety old lady, this
Mrs. M'Lerie. nor a scold, but a lov
able old soul who rejects the wishes
of "her man" to the veriest lot and
vhose love for her son Johns "wee
lassie' reaches even to the depths of
her canny Scotch purse.
Mrs M'Lerie's "Glaagle" Scotch Is
not hard to read. One does not have to
pause between a choke and a sneeze
to mouth the words which fall from
her oracular lips. When she is relat
ing lively circumstances her burr is
softened into vivid Queen's Enc ish.
For example. *ben she pours Into

Hardy Muse Runs
Wild in "Dynasts"
- AIGLON, standing affrlchted
I upon Wagram field and conjur-
L ing up the terrible spirits of the
pact, saw not such a stupendous
host of pfeantoms nor heard such a
rustling of vampire wings as those
which came In a vision to Thomas
Hardy, the English man of letters. His
study must have been surcharged with
disembodied ehad^s, astral archancels
and grinning trolls when he set him
self to the -writing of "The Dynasts."
The gibbering of bogles of unright
eousness, the whieper of mysterious
sprites of the air. the soundinz call of
Azrael-what uncanny voices were
there absent from that unholy chorus
which dinned into the ears of the
would-be dramatist a Jumbled roar of
unintelligible sounds and caused hla
pen to attempt vainly the transcrip
tion of this bedlam of thousht prompt
' For it was a drama of the Napoleon
ic throes which Hardy was attempt
ing; a drama in three parts, nineteen
acts and thirty scenes. Shades of
Chinese tragedy! The first part of this
stupendous dramatic panorama we
have uith us now: as to the other two.
Mr. Hardy naivHy state* that they are
"in hand'Â»and their publication "is not
KuarartÂ»Â»*>d." This doling out of one
ooriFignrr.ent first shows thai Mr.
Hardy h^s at 1Â« as* the dramatic rnan
ager's instinct and that he is "trying
:t an a dog."
The author cannot be blamed for
having an imagination. It Is readilv
understood that the remarkable period
of Ktrrsg which was straining the na
tions of Europe Just one hundred years
ago produced effects which mav well
tire the imagination of a less worthy
man than Hardy. The tremendous
sweep of army after army, the crash
,of thrones and the rending of boun
daries cannot but produce In the mind
of .any one of poetic sensibilities a
mental picture of the dreadful tenor of
those times. Such has been the effect
upon Hardy. But he .would give this
impressive visualized epic out to a less
imaginative world and therein he
makes a mistake.
The task is too great for the pen of
the author. He cannot be a Homer or
a Milton. He has not the power to
grasp the enormous thought in Its en
tirety. The theme at the back of it
all which holds together all of the
multitudinous cantos and makes the
one great unit may be In his mind but
not in his work. The result is that the
epic drama which- he hoped to create
is naught but a fearsome olla p<jdrida
of disjointed visions.
To be fair to Mr. Hardy, he seem*d
to realize his inability, for In a lengthy
foreword he admits that "in devistng
this chronicle piece no attempt has
been made to create that completely
organic structure of action and closely
webbed development of character and
motive which are demanded In a
drama strictly self-contained." On the"
contrary, he leaves it to the reader to
fill up the gaps and the waste places
from the fonts of his own* imagina
tion, thus giving the drama itself the
capacity of a handy Baedeker, as it
were, to Napoleonic epic verse. But
a not very intelligible handbook "The
Dynasts" proves to be.
Not the least of the stumbling
blocks (n the path of the willing
reader are the "Phantom Intelli-
p^nces" which wing their astral (tight
from cover to cover. "The Ancient
Spirit of the Years," "The Shade of
the Earth." "Spirit o/ Pities" and
countless companion disembodied con
ceptions of philosophy are made to di
rect the figures on the blood red stage
below like marionettes at a puppe'
show. They debate, philosophize and
wrangle even. Their part in the piece
is very much like- those of "First
Spirit" and "Second Spirit" in Cole
ridge's "Ancient Mariner."
For these creatures Hardy must
needs make some vindication. In his
preface he says: "Their doctrines are
but tentative, and are advanced with
little eye to a systematized philosophy
warranted to lift 'the burthen of the
mystery* of this unintelligible world.
The chief thing hoped for them is
that they and their utterances may
have dramatic plausibility enough to
procure for them, in the words of
Coleridge, 'that willing suspension of
disbelief for the moment which con
stitutes poetic faith.' "
It is not manifest that Hardy en
deavors to throw any new historical
light upon the Napoleonic wars,
though In his foreword he declares
that England's part in that great
struggle has been heretofore slighted
by European writers. His insistent
reiteration of the fact that all the
actors in the great warfare were but
puppets in the hands of "the Imma
nent Will" cannot be thought to be
any addition to> the historical record
by those who believe that we are, all
of us, in the hollow of God's hand.
The Almighty was known to have
shielded- Israel- from their enemies
while Napoleon was still the soul of
an Egyptian cat. may be.
From the viewpoint of style, Mr.
Hardy's work may be said to be good
rhetoric, but very poor verse. The
blank verse, if. chopped into separate
sentences, would be found to be
grammatically correct, but for blank
verse it is hardly to be accepted as
worthy of the name. There are many
weary wastes of djalogue to be tra
versed and few water springs of true
poesy rejoice the weary traveler. In
spiration seems to be lacking in the
verse, even though It supplied the
Mr. Hardy has made his name at
fiction. He has written some little
verses which are good. Bui it is
sincerely to be hoped that he will not
be encouraged into the completion of
parts two and three of this nlneteen
act phantasmagoria.

Spearman Is Lost
Without an Engine
f\ LAS and alack-n-dny! - Frank
fj Spearman has been betrayed into
I * the hands of mammon. He has
left the Rockv Mountain division
and the Spider bridge to shift for
themselves and has answered the call
of the hour for a novel of slocks and
bonds. â¢â¢The Close of the Day." Just
published, contains 224 pages and not
one word about engines or telegraph
operators. It is to be feared that Frank
Spearman was on a wild 'engine 'when
he wrote this, his latest.
It is distinctly a Rocky Mountain
rrade that' Spearman travels In this
new novel of his. There are twists and
turns in the story's roadbed which
would make the head of an engineer
swim. Sometimes there is an ominous
slipping and a whirring of the sanded
wheels. The landscape traversed is
somewhat dry and barren and the end
of the story leaves you In a tunnel of
the most oppressing gloom. Truly
Spearman had best stick by his old
railroad if he wishes to write a story
which is worth while.
Instead of hitting upon a construct
ing engineer or a night operator at the
telegraph key to submit as the hero
of his story, the author chooses a Chi
cago coffee broker, club man and bon
vlvant to hew the path in this new
wilderness of fiction. For Spearman,
who has never got far away from
his engine, must have a resourceful
hero to carry a novel which has noth
ing to do with railroads. Hence the
big man on the coffee exchange.
At the start the hero Is disclosed as
the host at a little midnight supper for
an actress and a dancer. This gives
him the needed earmarks of a man of
the world. But in order that George
Durant. the hero, may be thrown into
the proper circle of affinity with Kat,h
erine Sims, heroine, it is necessary that
he pass through an agonizing sickness,
be nursed to health by the father of
the heroine and become the natural
protector of the girl when that father
has passed away. Here, then,. is the
stereotyped situation accomplished;
middle-aged bachelor of very free hab
its, presumably, drawn by debt of
gratitude to innocent young woman,
left friendless and penniless; innocent
young woman has ambition, middle-
aged bachelor has Influence; ambition
plus influence equals success on part
of I. Y. W.v-Then what happens? What
a!>yays' dbes^-happen . tri such a" situa
tion? "'Love."^6f '.course. Greatly, to 'his
surprise triiddle~-ng<Â»d bachelor recog
nizes what .js 'the matter with "him.
Object ' cf â  affections drawn toward
younger" riian, /not. realising; of course;
what is, the matter with. the bachelor.
Silence; secret locked up I heroically,
financial .disinters; sickness, and at
last de^th. Middle-aged bachelor's
death, to te sure. â¢ . :
Such Is "The Close of the Day"; of
suÂ»h ara nin^iiÂ» and nine other stories.
The distinguishing feature about "Ths
Close' of the Day" {s that It combines
the atmosphere of the exchange and*
thft calcium glare of the sta*e for It*
mise en scene. ', The stoeks and bonds
element Is not Intruded beyond the ne
cessity of accounting for the hero's
gradual "decline and fall," as Mr.
Wegg would say in matters financial.
The stage feature of the story is.th*
leading one and a vfry attractive com?
ponent of the tale It Is. The author
has the knack of bringing to the fort
the gauds and tinsel of stageland so
that the reader feels the reality ,of it
all. â  That part of Spearman's story
which deals with Katherlne's achieve
ments in the "Mikado** is good read-
Ing.
Particular exception, however, must
be taken to the lame way in which
the plot fs brought to a close. There
seems no artistic excuse for making
the hero an old and broken man before
his time and bringing him to his death
in the last chapter with the heroine
looking on from the arm of his rival.
The Impression is gained that Spear
man found his story running away
with' him nnd adopted thU as the only
expedient for a hard pressed hero.
.Spearman's story bears. a striking
resemblance to the "Mr. Salt" -of Will
Payne! Since Payne's is a typical story
of high-pressure life. In a great city
and written only a little while before
Spearman's it must be taken that both
authors were, seeking to answer the
new demand for novels of affairs -as
one would hasten to fill orders on May
wheat- But Spearman should stick
by his engine, for his journey afield
hns not been the most successful In
the world.

comoasa " of a i6mo. volume of 190
pages the author has detailed ., the
story of the early American peoples
with a completeness which is entirely
satisfying to : ny casual reader.
The limitations of space have forced
the author to make a compilation
from the works of standard archaeol

than to devote attention to the expo
sition of any theories of his own, for
theories-concerning these early civili

Renders^ of Success will find much
to delight them In the February issue,
which ,a Ions list ht articles
of unusual Interest: > The-cover, by F.
B. Masters, is exceptionally attractive.
It represents Sir Henry Irving and Miss
Ellen Terry .In the scene from "the
Merchant of Venice" where Portia
pleads*, with Shylock to show mercy,
that mercy which "droppeth as the gen
tle rain from heaven." The -costumes
which-have lent so much to the charm
of the Irving-Terry performances of
thi6 great, Sha-kespearean . drama have
been faithfully reproduced by Mr- Mas

_ The February Everybody's has .an
other first-clasa "scoop" r -nothlng less
than a ; statement of what thV^Demo
cratic party now stands for, by the new
leader of the Democracy in the House,
Congressman John Sharp Williams.
There could be no more valuable . con
tribution to .the approaching Presiden
tial controversy than, this definite
avowal of principles ; by ' the-, distin
guished leader, whole clever work' in
Congress has attracted so much atten
tion. Another competent feature U
Emory R. Johnson's explanation : of

of the Isthmian Canal Commission, who
devoted hla attention to collecting the
statistics which should demonstrate the
economical value of the great water

Events move so fast In these days
that It Is as much as the dally press
- can do to keep up with the procession.
â¢For a monthly to do so Is much more
difficult. And yet the Booklovers' Mag
azine for February has contrived to
keep Itself well abreast of current
events. Its leading articles are not only
timely, but are of more than passing
Importance. Such especially are Tal
cott Williams* article on Mr. Chamber
lain's fiscal policy as it will affect Eu
rope and America, Frank H. Taylor's
account of the Panama canal purchase
and Gustav Kobbe's story of Wagner
and his art. These last two articles are
fully Illustrated. The art features for
February are In themselves unique:
they also touch on some newer phases
of artistic work hitherto but little ex
ploited in modern magazines. C. Tar
nall Abbott explains In an apprecia
tive way and with the aid of a dozen
striking pictures the alms and methods
of the new school of photographic por
traiture that Is revolutionizing a hith
erto somewhat discredited art.
"Country Life In. America for

"The First Principles of Horseback
Riding," showing the delights of

Scribner's^Magaxlne for February be
gins one of thos'e series which from the
days of the Thackeray Letters to the
Waddington Letters have been charac
teristic of this magazine. Mrs. George
Bancroft's Letters from England are a
worthy successor to these notable liter
ary achievements. Mrs. Bancroft was
a brilliant woman, bort^ In Plymouth,
Mass.. and all her life associated with
people of distinction. As a young girl
she was a great friend. of Emerson and
.his wife, .and- of many, of . the Brook
Farm 'people. She married I George
Bancroft, the historian, in. 1S3S and
when he was sent to England as Min
ister in 1846 she wrote these letters,
principally In. diary <â  form.- to her chil
dren. The Bancrofts knew all the emi
nent people in politics, society and lit
erature. It was the age of Samuel

- Robert ' Grant's aerial. "The â¢ Under

Captain Mahan's distinguished nar
rative of the war of 1812 analyzes the
unpopularity of the war In sections of
the United States, and defends the

The February Delineator Is a maga-,
zine of uncommon interest and value.
Its stories, articles and pictures are ex
cellent, and the review of the fashions.
Including a letter from Mr?. Osborn.
thorough and enlightening. In fiction
there is a mystical tale entitled "The
Silver Boat." by AlbeTt BUelow Paine;
a strong love story from the Pacific by
Fdijah Proctor Clarke. "The Wooing of

mance by L. M. Montpomery;* also a
chapter of. the â¢â¢Evolution of a Club

Notable x amnng the February Cen

trait of General Washington, the copy
of an original painting now for the

th* general public. The portrait was

The February number of The Smart
Sot opens with a striking novelette,
"The Wanderers," by Gertrude Lynch
âa story with a wholly new theme, aa
strong as It Is Interesting. The dra
matic Incidents which follow a man
who has kidnaped his own child, after
a stormy quarrel with the wife who
has Just divorced him, are stirring in
the extreme, and the story is written
with that literary distinction which al
ways characterizes Miss Lynch's work.
It Is a memorable novelette.
Alnslee's for February offers an es
pecially attractive table of contents.
The novelette is by Elizabeth Duer.
who contributed that for the Christ
mas number. Her new story, "A
Natural Divorce." Is a decided im
provement on the former. Though Its
action Is laid in the same surround
ings, there lÂ» more of the drmmatia
element, the characters are more
sharply drawn and the plot la better
balanced. James H. Gannon Jr. be
gins In this number the first of a se
ries of "Stories of the Street," entitled
"The Control, of the St. Louis South
ern." It Is dpne by one who Is thor
oughly familiar with the subject and
Is as good as Lefevre's bea). which iÂ»
saying the most that can be said. Dor
othy Dlx has another of her delightful
little talks with women â "Choosing *>
Husband" â full of the sort of advic*
that, in these days, most women
should take to heart. A particularly
charming little story is Cosmo Hamil
ton's "In Regard to Optimism.** It la
a story ef French peasant life. la.
which there seems to be such an in
exhaustible fund of the "teuch sf
nature that makes the whole
world kin."

"Oh! Oh! Oh!" A young fellow.
lying asleep in the furs, bearded and
wan and weary, raised a moan of
pain, and without v.-akir.g increased
the pit< h and intensity of his anguish.
His body half lifted from the blankets
end quivered and shrank spasmodic
ally, as though drawing away from a
bed of nettles.
"Roll'm T over!" ordered Bett!es.
"He's crampinV
"Damn that trail!" he muttered
softly, as he threw off the robes and
eat up. "I've run across country,
played quarter three seasons hand
running and hardened myself in all
manner of ways, and then I . pilgrim.

and rolled"*i cigarette. "Oh. I'm not

ed of myself, that's all. Here I am,
on top of a dirty thirty miles, as
knocked up and stiff and sore as a
pink tea degenerate after a five-mile
walk on a country turnpike."
"Don't git the tantrums, youngster,"
Bettles waxed patriarchal. "Ye've
gotter 'low some for the breakin'-in.

tn your make-up which has sent many
a husky man to the bosom of Abraham
afore his right and proper time."
"Streak of fat?"
"Yep. Comes along of bulk. 'Tain't
the big men as Is the best when it
comes to the trail."
"Never heard of it."
"Never heerd of it, eh? Well, it's a
dead straight, open-an'-shut fact, an*

for a mighty big effort, but 'thout stay-

wiry fellows when it comes to gittin'
right down an* hangin* on like a lean-
Jowled dog to a 'bone."
"Look you. brothers," broke In Sitka
Charley from his seat on the grub box.
"Ye have spoken of the streak of fat
that runs in big men's muscles, and ye
have spoken women and the love, and
ye have spoken fair; but I have in
mind things which happened when the
land was young and the fires of men
far apart as the stars. It was then I
had concern with a big man, and a
streak of fat. and a woman. And the
woman was small; but her heart was
greater than the beef heart of the
man, and she had grit. And we travel
ed a weary trail, even to the salt wa
ter, and the cold was bitter, the snow
deep, the hunger great. And the
woman's love was a mighty love â no
more can man say than this.
"Brothers, my blood Is red with Si
wash, but my heart Is white. A great
truth came to me when I was vet a
boy. I learned that to your kind and
you was given the earth: that the Si
wash could not withstand you and, like
the caribou and the bear, must perish
in the cold. So I came into the warm
and sat among you, by your fires, and.
behold! I became one of you. I have
seen much In my time. I have known
strange things, and bucked big. on big
trails, with men of many breeds. And
because of these things I measure
deeds after your manner, and judge
men. and think thoughts. Wherefore,
when I speak harshly of one of your
own kind I know you will not take it
amiss; and when I speak high of one
of rr.y father's people you will not take
it upon you to say: 'Sitka Charley is
Biwash, and there is a crooked light
In his eyes and tmall honor to his
tongue.' Is it not bo?"
Deep down in throat the circle vouch
safed its assent.
"The woman was Passuk. I got her
in fair trade from her people, who were
of the coast and whose Ohilcat totem
stood at the head of a salt arm erf the
sea. My heart did. not go out to the
woman, nor did I take ptock of her
looks. For she scarce took her eyes
from the ground, and she was timid
and afraid, as pirls will be when cast
Into a et- .neer's arms whom they ha- Â»
never p*Â»*>ji befcrre. One blanket would
cover the twain; ko I chose Passuk.
"Have I not said I was a servant to
the Government? So I was taken on a
warship, sleds and dogs and evaporated
foods, and with me came Passuk. And
we went north to the winter ice rim of
Bering Sea, where we were landedâmy
self and Passuk and the dogs. I was
also given moneys of the Government,
for I was its servant, and charts of
lands which the eyes of man had never
dwelt upon, and messages. These mes
sages were sealed and protected shrewd
ly from the weather, and I was to de
liver them to the whale ships of the
Arctic, icebound by the great Macken-
ZIP.
"Afterward, in the spring, when the
days lengthened and there was a crust
to the snow, we came south, Passuk
and I, to the country of the Yukon. A
weary journey, but the sun pointed out
the way of our feet. It was a naked
land then, as 1 have said, and we
worked ur> the current with pole and
paddle till we came to Forty-mile Good
it was to see white faces once again,
so we put in to the bank. And that
winter was a hard winter. The dark
ness and the cold drew down upon us,
and wiih them the famine. To each
man the agent gave forty pounds of
flour and twenty of bacon.
"Then came v- together In the store
one night, and the empty shelves made
u? feel our own emptiness the more.
We talked low. by the light of the fire,
for the candles had been set aside for
those who might yet gasp in the
spring. Discussion was heid, and it
was said that a man must go forth
to the Salt Water and tell to the
world our misery. At this all eye*
turned to me, for it was understood
that I was a great traveler. "It Is 700
r. :?s,' said I, 'to Haines Mission by
thÂ« sea, and every in.h of it snowshoe
work. Give me the pi of your dogs
and the best of your grub and I will
go. And with rr si 11 go Pasauk.'
â¢"To this they were agreed. But there
arose one. Long Jeff, a Yankee man,
big-boned and big muscled. Also hia
talk was big. He, too, was a mighty
traveler, he said, born to the snowehoe
and brought up- on buffalo milk. He
would go with me, in case I fell by the
trail, that he might carry the word on to
the Mission. How was I to know that
big talk betokened the streak of fat. or
that Yankee men who did great things
kept their teeth together? So we took
the pick of the dogs and the best of the
grub Rnd struck the trail, we threeâ
Passuk. Long Jeff and I.
"I will talk little of the toll, save
that on some days we made ten miles,
and on others thirty, but more often
ten. And the best of. the grub was not
good, while we went on stint from the
start.- Likewise the pick of the dogs
was poor, and we were hard put to
keep them on their legs. At the White
River our three sleds became two sleds,
and we had onlr come 200 miles. But
we lost nothing. The dogs that left the
traces went into the bellies' of those
that remained, 'v..
"Not a greeting, not a curl of smoke,
till we made the Pelly. Illere I had
counted on grub; and here I cqunted
on leaving Long Jeff, who was whining
and trail sore. But the factor's lungs
were wheezing, his eyes bright, his
cache nigh empty; and he showed us
the empty cache of the missionary, also
his grave with the rocks piled high to
keep off the dogs. There was a bunch
of Indians there, but babies and old
men there were none, and it was clear
that few would see the soring.
"So we pulled on light-stomached
and heavy-hearted, with half a. thous
and miles of snow and silence between
us and Haines Mission by the sea. The
darkncâ was at its worst,. and at mid
day the sun could not c"..Â«ar the sky
line to the south.. But the ' Ice jams
were smaller, the going better; so I
pushed the dogs hard and traveled late
and early.
"As I said at Forty-mile, every inch
of it was snowshoe -work. And the
shoes made great sores on our feet,
which cracked and scabbed but' would
not heal. And every day those sores
grew more grievous, till in the morn
ing when we girded on our shoes
Long Jeff cried like a child. I put
him at the fore of the sled to break
trail, but he slipped off the shoes for
comfort. Because of this the trail
was not packed, his moccasins made
great holes, and into these holes the
dogs wallowed. The bones of the dogs
were ready to burst through their
hides, and this was not good for them.
So I spoke hard words to the man, and
he promised, and broke his word.
Then I beat him with the dog-whip,
and after that the dogs wallowed no
more. He was a child, what of the
pain and the streak of fat. vv.
"But Passuk? While the man lay
by the fire and wept she cooked, and
in the morning helped lash the sleds
and in the evening to : unlash them.
And she saved the dogs. Ever â  was
she to the fore, lifting the webbed
shoes and making the way easy.
â¢'Passuk â how shall I say? â I took
it for granted that she should do
these things, and thought no more
GRIT OF WOMEN
about It For my mind was busy
with other matters, and besides I was
young in years and knew little
of woman. It wu only on looking
back that I came to understand.
"And the man became worthless. The
dogs had little strength In them, but he
stole rides on the sled when he lagged
behind. Passuk said she would take
the one sled, so the. man had nothing
to do. In the morning I gave him his
fair share of grub and started him on
the trail alone. Then the woman and
I broke camp, packed the sleds .and
harnessed the dogs. By. midday, when
the sun mocked us, we would overtake
the man, with the tears frozen. on his
cheeks, and pass him. In the night we
made camp, set aside his fair share of
grub and spread his furs. Also we
mad* a big fire that he might see. And
hours afterward he would: come limp
ing in and eat his grub with moans and
groans, and' sleep. He was not sick,
this man. He was only trail-sore and
tired, and weak with hunger. But Pas
suk and I were trail-sore and tired and
weak with hunger, and we did all the
work and he did none. But he had the
etrenk of fat of which our brother Bet
tleshas spoken. Further, we gave the
man always his fair share of grub.
"Then one day we met two ghosts
Journeying" through the Silence. They
were a man and a boy, and they were
white. The ice had opened on Lake Le
Barge, and through it had gone their
main outfit.. One blanket each carried
about his shoulders. At night they
built a, fire and crouched over it till
morning. They had a little flour. This
they stirred in warm water and drank.
The man showed me eight cups of
flourâ all they hadâ and Pelly,. stricken
with famine, â¢ 200 miles . away. - .They
said, also, that there was an Indian
behind; that they . had whacked;, fair,
but that he. could, not' keep up. I did
not believe they had. whacked fair, .else
would the Indian' have kept up. But I
THE ; SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALL.
could give them no grub. They strov*
to steal a dogâ the. fattest, *hich was
very thinâ but I shoved my pistol in
their faces and told them begone. And
they went away, like drunken men,
through, the silence toward Pelly. > : ;
"I had three dogs now, and one sled,
and the dogs were only bones and hair.
When there Is little wood the fire burns
low and the cabin grows cold. So with
us. ; With little grub the. frost bites
sharp and our faces were black and
frozen till our own' mothers would not
have known us. And our feet were
very sore. In the morning when I hit
the trail I sweated*to, keep down the
cry when .the pain" of the- snowshoes
smote me. Passuk j never opened her
lips, but stepped .to the fore to break
the way. The man howled.
"The Thirty-mile was swift and the
current ate away the ice from beneath-,'
and there were many airholes and
cracks and much open water. One day
we came upon the man.L resting, for he
had gone ahead, as was his wont, in .
the morning. But. between us was open
water. This he had passed around by
taking to the f lni ice, where it. was too
narrow for a sled. So we found an ice
bridge. Passuk- weighed little and went
first, with a long pole crosswise In her
hands in chance she broke through.
But she was light and her shoes large,
and she passed; over. Then she called
the dogs. But they had neither poles
nor shoes and they broke through and
were swept upder by the water. I held
tight to the sled from behind till the
traces .broke and the dogs went on
down under the ice." There was little
meat to them,*, but I had . counted on
them for a. week's grub, and they were
gone. i â â¢' . â¢ ...
"The next morning I divided all th%
grub, which was little, into three por
tions. And I told Long Jeff " that he
could keep up with us or not, as he saw
fit, for we were going ' to travel light
and fast. 'Blithe raised his: voice and
cried over his safe feet and his troubles
and said harsh things against comrade
ship. â  .ys>"'" â "â â â â < \
"Paesuk's feet were sore, and my feet
were sore â aye, sorer than his, for we
had worked with, the dogs; also, we
looked to see. Long Jeff swore he
would die. before he hit the trail again;
so Passuk took a fur robe and I a cook
ing pot and an ax and we made ready
to go.', . ; ,;'Ps-v^ ! Vl
"But she looked on the man's portion
and said: 'It is wrong to waste good
food on a baby. He is better dead.' I
shook my head .and said no â that a
comrade once was a comrade always.
"Then rhe spoke of the men of Forty
mile; that they were many men and
good, and that they looked tp me for
giub in the. spring. But when I' still
said no, she snatched the pistol from
mybelt quick, and, as our brother Bet
ties has spoken, Long Jeff went to the
bosom of Abraham before ,his time. I
chlded Passuk for this; but she showed
ho sorrow, nor was she sorrowful. And
in my heart I knew she was right.
"And day by day we passed in the
snow the sleeping, places of the two
ghostsâ Passuk and Iâ 8-1 we knew we
would be glad for such ere I we made
salt water.- Then we came to the In
dian, like another ghost, with his face
set toward Pelly. They had not
whacked up fair, the man and the boy,
he said, and he had had no flour for
three days. Each night he boiled pieces
of his moccasins In a cup and ate them.
He did not have much moccasins left.
And he was a coast Incian, and told
us these things through Passuk. whj
talked his tongue. He was 'a stranger
in the Yukon, and he knew, not. the way,'
but. his; face was set to Pelly. How far
was it? Two sleeps? Ten? A hun
dred? - He did not know," but he was
going to Pelly. 1 It was too far to turn
back;, he. couid, only keep on.
"He did not ask "for grub, for. hie
could see we, too, were hard put. Pas-
suk looked at the man and at me, as
though she were of two minds, like a
mother partridge whose young are in
trouble. So I turned to her and said:
'This man has been dealt unfair. Shall
I give him of our grub a portion?'
"I saw her eyes light, as with quick
pleasure; but she looked long at the
man and at me, and her mouth drew
close and hard, and she said: 'No. The
Salt Water is afar off, and Death lies
In wait. Better It is that he take this
stranger man and let my man Charley
pass.' So the man went away in si
lence toward Pelly. .That night she
wept. Never had I seen her weep be
fore. Nor was It the smoke of the
fire, for the wood Was dry wood.
"We spoke little. Passuk and I. In
the days which came. In the night
we lay In the snow like dead people,
and in the morning we went on our
way, walking like dead people. And
all things were dead. There were no
ptarmigan, no squirrels, no snowshoe
rabbits â nothing. The river made no
sound beneath its white robes. The
sap was frozen in the forest. And it
became cold, as now; and in the night
the stars drew near and large, and
leaped and danced; and in the day the
sundogs mocked us till we saw many
suns, and all the air flashed and
sparkled, and the snow was diamond
dust. And there was no heat, no
sound, only the bitter cold and the
silence.
"As I say, we walked like dead peo
ple, as in a dream, and we kept no
count ; of time. . Only our faces were
set to salt water, our souls strained
for salt water and our feet carried us
toward salt water.
"Our last grub went, and we had
shared fair, Passuk and I, but she fell
more often,* and at Caribou Crossing
her strength left her. And in the morn
ing we lay beneath one robe and did
not take the trail. It was in my mind
to stay there and meet death hand-to
hand with Passuk: tor I had grown
old, and had learned the love of woman.
Also It was eighty miles to Halnes Mis
â lon. and the great Chllcoot, far above
the timber line, reared his storm-swept
head between. But Passuk spoke to
me, low, with my ear against her lips
that I might hear. And now. because
â be need not fear my anger, she spoke
her heart, and told me of her love, and
of many things which X did not under
stand. . .-- â¢
, "And she said: "You are my man,
Charley, and I have been a nood woman
to ypu. And in all the days I have
made your fire, and cooked your food,
and fed your dogs, and lifted paddle or
broken trail, I ha*ve not complained.
â Nor did I say that there was more
warmth, in the lodge of my father, or
'that.'tn'exn was roote/grub on the Chll
caÂ£.'- When you have spoken, I have
listened. When yojr have ordered. I
have obeyed. bJfctm so, Charley?*
"And I said; 'Ay.e'.'ii Js so.'
"And she said: JTghen first you came
to the Chllcat, no^ looked upon me.
but bought me as* man buys a dog.
and took me away, my heart was hard
against you and filled with bitterness
and fear. But that was long ago. For
you were kind to me, Charley, as a
good man Is kind to his dog. Tour
heart was cold, and there was no room
for me; yet you dealt me fair and your
ways were Just. And I was with you
when you did bold deeds and led great
ventures, and I measured you against
the men of other breeds, and I saw
you stood amons them full of honor,
and your word was wise, your tongue
true. And I grew proud of you. till
it came that you filled all my heart,
and all my thought was of you. You
were as the midsummer sun. when its
golden trail runs in a circle and never
leaves the sky. And whatever way I
c*at mv eyes I beheld the sun. But
your heart wts ever cold. Charley, and
there was no room.'
"And I said: 'It is so. It was cold,
and there was no room. But that la
past. | Now my heart Is like the snow
fall in the spring, when the sun has
come back. There is a great thaw and
a bending, a sound of running waters,
and a budding and sprouting of green
things.- And there is drumming of
partridges and songs of robins, and
great music, for the winter is broken.
Passuk, and I have learned the love of
woman.' j. â¢ V ,- . - â â  j .
'.'She ' smiled and moved for me teÂ»
draw her closer.- And she said. "I am
glad.' After that she lay quiet for a
long time, breathing softly, her head
upon my breast. Then she whispered:
" 'The trait ends here, and I am tirfcd.
But first I would speak of other things.
In the long ago. when I was a girl on
the Chllcat.. I played alone among the
skin bales of my father's lodge: for the
men: were away on the hunt, and the
wonjen and, boys were dragging in thÂ»
meat. It was in the spring, and I was
alone. A great brown bear. Just awake
from his winter's sleep, hungry, his fur
hanging to the bones in flaps of lean
ness, shoved his head within the lodge
and said "Ooof!" My brother came run
ning back with the first sled of meat.
And he fought the bear with burning
sticks from the fire, and the dogs in
their harnesses, with the sled behind
them, fell upon the bear. There was a
great battle and much noise. They
rolled in the fire, the skin bales were
scattered.' the lodge overthrown. But
In the end the bear lay dead, with the
fingers of my brother in his mouth and
the marks of his claws upon my broth
er'? '-.ice. Did you mark t!ie Indian
by the jjafiy trail, his mitten whlcL had
no thumb, his hand ] which he warmed
by oirure?- He was my brother. And
I said he should have no grub. And he
wenf away in the Silence without grub.
â¢â¢This, my brothers, was the love of
Passuk, who died in the snow, by thÂ»
Caribou' ' Crossing. It was a mighty
love, for she denied her brother for the
man who led her away on weary trails
to a bitter end. And, further, such
was this woman's love, she denied her
self. Ere her eyes closeQ for the last
time she took my hand and slipped It
under her squirrel-skin parka to her
waist. I felt there a well-filled pouch,
and learned the secret of her lost
strength. Day by day we had shared
fair, to the last least bit; and day by
day but half her share had she eaten.
"And she said: This Is the end of the
trail for Passuk; but your trail, Char
ley, leads on and on. over the great
Chllcoot, down to Haines Mission and
the sea. And it leads on and on, by the
light of many suns, over unknown
lands and strange waters, and It is full
of years and honors and great glories.
It leads you to the lodges of many
women, and good women, but It will
never lead you to a greater love than
the love of Passuk.'
"And I knew the woman spoke true.
But a madness came upon me and I
threw the well- filled pouch from me
and swore that my trail had reached
an end till her tired eyes grew soft
with tears, and she said: 'Among men
has Sltka Charley walked In honor
and ever has his word been true. Does
he forget that honor now and talk vain
words by the Caribou Crossing? Does
he remember no more the men of Forty
mile, who gave him of their grub the
best, of their dogs the pick?'
"And when she grew cold In my
arms I arose and sought out the well
filled pouch and girt on my snowshoees
and staggered along the trail, for there
was a weakness in my knees, and mV
head was dizzy, and In my ears theie
was a roaring and a flashing of rt a
upon my eyes.
"And In this wise, like a ma i
bereft of reason, who sees strange vis -
ions and whose thoughts are light wit i

OF all furnishings Louis XV and
Louis XVI are by far the roost
elaborate, the most costly and
the daintiest and Just at pres-
ent thej^appear to be the most
popular. And small wonder. There is
nothing fantastic or grotesque about
it. for under Louis XIV all the queer
end the grotesque were eliminated and
only the beautiful that was really
beautiful was left.
In those days famous men were born,
and. what is more to the point, their
great work was recognized under the
liberal French policy and the decora
tive art was boomed to such an ex
tent that St has lasted through all the
Intervening years and is Just as strong
Ur-day as it was then.
Everything was elaborate, exquisite
ly dainty and costly, for the history
cf Louis XV was a history of luxury.
and the prodigality of his people was
reflected Jn the character of the fur
,'niture, dress and decorations. All were
of the most extravagant and full of
jdetails known as rococo (roc et co
.Quille, rock and shell).
j The period was dominated over by
â¢ a. woman. Mme. Pompadour, and her
love for the beautiful and the glittery*
combined with her willful extrava
gance, rave rise to a certain form of
upholstery known as the Pompadour
work. She was ever looking for some
thing: new and novel, and after ehe bad
conquered a kingdom and ruled the
people as she pleased she sighed for
smaller worlds to dictate to. The elab
orate and rarÂ« carvings in her apart
ments tired her. eo phe promptly bad
the beautiful examples of designs in
woodwork and frescoing covered with
a tufted, soft, yielding fabric, and for
a time the fad was taken up and car
ried to all manner of extremes and
the moÂ«?t exquisitely carved furniture
x>a.s hidden under beautiful fabrics, to
be sure, but nothing: that could com
pare favorably with the exquisite hand
work.
Yet, on the other hand, her first
effort to make great; masses of gilt
stand out like nuggets of gold and
dazzle the eye resulted In the rococo
work, and Its main object seemed to
be to make the glitter project like
rocks, and before very long the thing
was so much overdone that even to
speak of it suggested the vulgar and
the love of great display.
It vr&s a
of ostentation. The Countess du Bar
ry tried in every way to outshine her
predecessor, and it is owing: to her
that the Louis XV period became
eriod clearl
MAKING OVER OLD SHIRT WAISTS
Those who have two old waists, or
two bits of cloth, neither one of which
Is big enough for a whole waist, can
make a nice, new pretty waist by util
izing both pieces of cloth.
Suppose the waist proper be made of
dark brown cashmere or of dark brown
*ilk flannel. Then let the yoke be made
of tan colored flannel and let the sleeve
epaulettes be made of the same stuff.
This affords sharp contrast. The cuffs
are lined wjth the contrasting color,
and, of course, the stock is made of it.
Waists are of green flannel, with a
pale coffee colored yoke, and all over
the yoke there are French knots of
green.
Another waist la made of navy blue
doth, while the yoke Is in a warm tan.
Navy blue knots and light blue knots
dot this yoke and make it pretty. The
idea is to secure a contrast and the
very prettiest effects are obtained. The
best waists are made from a very soft
and very fine silk flannel which comes
In every known shade. This makes up
well and, if due attention be paid to the
yoke and its trimming*, the waist Is as
sured of a place in good society.
The woman who likes to pipe can get
busy, for there will be a great deal of
piping upon the dark blouses of spring.
Park cloth is piped with bright silk and
thus the blouse ii lifted from somber
cess into prettlness.
One such blouse which was In a navy
blue corded silk and was piped with red
plaid taffeta while the stock and cuffs
were trimmed with half a dozen piplnxs
of the plain silk. There was a wide
crush belt of red leather to match the
reddest color in the silk.
Pipings of very gay blue are used
upon gowns of deep red, and pipings of
deep red are very conspicuous upon
waists that are made of green, of brown
and of black. Every 'effort Is exerted
to get a broad contrast and the waists
of spring will be noticeable for. the fact
that there are several colors In them.
They do not savor of monotony.
White linen waists will be trimmed
with one band of Persian embroidery
running down the front The stock and
cuffs will repeat the embroidery, which
will be about three inches widi-. Again
there will be white canvas waists trim*
rned with wide bands of Oriental silk
stiffened and adjusted upon the front
of the waist to be removed on wash
day. -iv^W'
Women who can do handwork are
buying heavy white canvas ard work
ing a panel for the front of the waist
in cross stitch. This panel may be In
a Grecian pattern, conventional and
carried out in all colors, but It should
be done In a very neat cross stitch em
broidery in such a way that the whole
of the linen Is covered. In this manner
the Oriental effect Is produced..
But don't. In the scheme of the sum
mer Eblrt waist, forget the fringes and
the tassels of summer, for these will be
as popular as they ever were In the
1820 days.
"It keeps dressmakers awake nights
keeping track of all the new sleeves,
but It la pretty business and we like it,"
and the modiste picked up a pair of
sleeves which looked suspiciously. like
lamp shades and proceeded to sew them
Into the armhole of a pale blue Jawn.

Variety, However. Is the keynote of
the American woman's character, and
novel ideas must be -forever and
eternally creeping in to satisfy her de
mands. There doesn't, chance to be a
French King whose dictates she must
follow and as a consequence she per
mits her fancy to _ run , riot and she
does exactly as she pleases in the dec
orating and upholstering Uut. and
what she wants most are ne,w pieces
that are exclusive' a,ftd quaint.
For drawing-rooms, however, nothing
could *be' better or more suitable than
this return to the classics, simplified,
and this 1b where the walnut furniture
finds Its home."
It is not a richly, decorative furniture
and there isn't* the least' suspicion of
tortoise shell or brass about It. rather
it is delightfully plain and: to-the.un
initiated would represent a, very small
money value. In reality it costs a pretty
penny.* ;
The -, real walnut. Is a]l imported and
the amount of, carving depends upon
the Italians who do the handwork, but
in color it is always a peculiar, luster
less brown that 'looks most unfinished.
And of a truth It Is. 'Louis XIV affect
ed'natural fiowerst and employed rib
bon'and lace effects,- festoohed flowers
and hanging baskets with the rococo
details, and the .ornamentations were
generally brought in strong relief by
gold â  or brpnie. Louis XVI simplified
nil furniture to such an extent that
there was; little carving and the legs
were usually straight and suggested
architectural columns more than-any
thing else. But in this age there is a
something that is a sort of go-between,
and the finish and carving is Just what
pleases thÂ« fancy of the purchaser the
most.
. Instead of being ornamented -. with
scrolls, and mountings of metal and the
whole gilded with an alloy of mercury
and gold the wood is left In Its natural
state and a cane back and seat are
inserted in place of the Gobelin or
Beauvais tapestry, for there are no
more state receptions of the King, and
probably If there were the cane would
be considered quite good enough for
bin). ..--.-. â  < : â ','
; The chairs, which are small and light,
frequently look as though a good gust
of wind would blow them away, but
they will hold the heaviest sort of
a weight and never so much as groan.
Some are made with arms on either stde
and minus aVback, and now and then
one finds them Ilk* a miniature settle,
and sometimes {hey resemble nothing
on earth quite as much as a carved
hall chair.
But there is thÂ« quaintest kind of a
lounge that Is decidedly Frenchy. In
stead of being ' ]n one straight piece,
as they usually are. it is a combina
tion affair that may be utilized in a
number of ways. There are three dis
tinct and separate pieces all complete-
ly finished, and apparently one does not
depend upon tbe other in the slightest.
YÂ«t when the pieces are taken from
their respective places in the room and
fitted . together they make one of thÂ«
moat comfortable couches one could
wish for, and make, in the bargain, a.
decidedly quaint bit of furniture.
Cabinets are a delightful bit of wal
nut. All the early curves and arches
were replaced by Marie Antoinette for
straight lines and the leys of the cabi
net taper toward tbe feet and give it
a very slender appearance. In fact,
with its oval medallions supported by
cupids and the portraits of smiling
children. It makes one of thÂ» most
charming: acquisitions to a parlor or
reception room where a light effect is
desired. .
The finish depends . entirely upon the
color scheme employed. There* is a
bronze, a peculiar green gold, a pol
ished glittery gold, the, dull effect and
a combination of the gold and bur
nished that Is perhaps the most used
of any of the gilts. . But the pure,
straight walnut, when finished In what
is termed a "wax finish." Is by far thÂ«
prettiest, the most serviceable and thÂ»
richest looking of all. The wax seems
to darken the, color and the warm
brown, with perhaps a. thread of gold
outlining the carving, i* decidedly dis
tinctive and beautiful. \
Watt coverings were as great an Item
those days as they are now. More so,
in fact, for tapestry -factories were es
tablished that were the property of thÂ»
crown and they wert kept busy turn
ing out decorations that would be suit
able for wall panels, and no room was
deemed â  complete that was not ! cov
ered with the pictorial fabric. Louis
XIV ran to the more classical and se
rious work. Instead of the battle scenes
and 'the frivolous, pastoral sentiments
that were made famous by Watteau
and that so delighted the heart of Louis
XV. He was fond of the ladies and
nothing pleased him more than to -see
his court in fashionable attire depicted
In a romantic fashion.
Now tapestries are used, but the panel
fabrics are by far the most popular and
the most beautiful. Some of them in
a cloth of gold are very beautiful and
frequently cost more than a hundred
dollars a yard, but they are charming
as a background to set off one of thÂ»
darker woods that contrasts strongly
with it. The satin effects in two tones
are rich looking and when the carpet
blends to a nicety nothing prettier
could be imagined than a typical
French apartment.
While rooms that are used more or
less for show are delightful In this pe
riod, bedrooms are also particularly
fetching and elaborate owing to the
fact that It was the custom of fash
ionable ladles to receive their guests in
bed. The bed itself was more than
sumptuous with bouquets of plumes or
feathers rising from the head posts.
These feathers, by the way, were of
various colors and sizes and had no
symbolism, simply decorative.
Nowadays there seems to be more or
less prejudice about the great, heavy
wooden bed and the brass bed i3 frank
ly asked for. but unless It Is beauti
fully draped the great majority of
decorators cry out against it and com
plain that its environment is not ap
propriate and that It is never in har
mony with the reat of the furnishings.
- There Is one feature of this favorite
period that is exceptionally beautiful
and that is the. draperies that were
used In such profusion: The walls,
even to the doors, were paneled, and
the window hangings were most elabo
rate.
In pictures and In ornaments there
Is an endless variety. In fact, the sup
ply is boundless and so fascinating
that it is a gigantic task to know Just
what to select. Any delicately colored
picture in a dainty gold frame shows
off well against it* costly background,
and a marble bust or vase never falls
to look Its very best when holding Its
own on one of the spindle-legged
tables that seem especially made for
that very purpose.
So. if you. Miladl, are seriously think
ing of fitting uo a new reception-room
that is to be kept always in the very
best of order and that the family is
not allowed to visit unless there is a
valid excuse in the form of a guest,
hie yourself downtown and immediate
ly investigate the Italian walnut, and,
furthermore, asked to see it waxed. If
it fails to please you but one thing can
be ealdâ that you are more fastidious
and more difficult to please than the
most fastidious woman that ever lived
â Madame Pompadour â of the rein
o^f his Majesty Louis XV. . ~THE KNICKERBOCKER
THERE are two new dances
coming. It is perfectly true
that they have not been
. danced to any. great extent, but
they are being religiously practiced in
the parlor and In the silt-edge dancing
â¢chool, and every one. even the staid,
uitfoiQcd matron, is gliding through its
mystic mazes so that they may be
strictly up to snuff when the time
finally comes.
Their names are quite as good sound
ing as the steps themselves look. The
Niagara twostep and the Knicker
bocker waltz, and both are scheduled
to be the great dances of Easter week,
in fact they are the fancy steps that
the debutantes of New York Intend
making their first after Lenten bow in.
The Knickerbocker is not onl^ as
refirrJ as the cotillon and every bit
as pretty, but it is also very graceful
and displa>s lithe, rounded figures and
dainty gowns to the best Â»>ossible ad
vantage, for there is ru romping
Mhataoever about it.
It is a dance that combines the alert
ness of the twostep with the delights
of the gliding waltz, and for this very
reason it is certain to be a great fa
vorite with old-fashioned dancers, for
though it has new steps . in it, it is
three quarters dtveted to the old-time
glideâ the favorite waltz that one un
consciously associates with Strauss
music.
Besides this new Knickerbocker has
arother advantage. It makes a splen
did cotiKon figpx*. for it begins with a
pi and promenade down the hall, and
may be easily danced with two part
ners. As a dance it is strictly a society
one, for it is as "Mberate as the min
uet, and demands a certain amount of
time and dignity, and one steps
through its mazes without tripping on
one's long skirt, or without the least
fear of tearing one's costly laces, and
in this respect it differs from nearly al
most every other round dance of the
present day.
For a fancy dance it is splendidly
adapted, as it may be flirted through in
eld style, with the skirts lifted to the
ankles. Just as grandmother danced in
her time and generation. And if the
LOVE IN A GARDEN

fys\ \ ytrv\ I lyhocks and four-
o'clocks bloomed in
profusion; a bed of
sweet William spiced the air, and tufts
of striped grass rustled pleasantly in
the breeze. Morning glories climbed
â lender ' lines stretched against the
high brick wall and swung agile blos
soms from their perilous perch; quanti
ties of mignonette, hobnobbed with its
nearest neighbor, the stately, unbend

- In the midst of the garden was a huge
Colonial house of red brick. The house,
the garden and the high brick wall
gave one the impression of a bit of an
other century, quietly but stolidly hold
ing its own against the inroads of a

of her head, the beautiful modeling of
her features, the bewitching arch of
her instep and the delicate lines of her
little hands.
Thornton was young, sturdy and
broad-shouldered. The clear-cut lines
of his clean-shaven face pronounced
him an aggressive man of action.

covertly.

She flashed him a look of gratitude.
"You're very generous," she said. "See!
Dan's ankle is hurt. He limps badly."

They moved toward the tree.
"You should be in at the death, you
always are," said the girl. "I feel I've
filched a brush from you."

he. /'Sometimes I'd risk my neck to

themselves in the mottled shadow, the

"Listen!" he said suddenly.

pack came faintly; not the long, re

There is something particularly
fetching about it and It is probably due
to the fact that there is sufficient varia
tion of movement about it to make It
exceptionally fascinating. Those who
are very fond of slow dancing can
dance the tv.o-step in what Is com
monly known as "half-time." or taking
four slow steps where eight are gen
erally taken.
The pointing of the toe gives a splen
did opportunity for a pretty, graceful
movement, and the body may be turned
almost half way round, so that tha
partners are standing back to back,
yet there must be notning strained
about the position or else one could
search the length and breadth of thÂ«
land and not find any one position that
could be anywhere near as awkward.

seen but little on this coast as yet is
the wearing of the instep skirt for tha

two Inches longer than this delight
ful skirt. But as yet the great ma*
Jority still cling to the long, graceful,
clinging train. Those who wear It for
round dancing are compelled for twÂ»
reasons to hold It up constantly. It
is infinitely smarter, and trailing
around a ballroom endangers the Ufa
of the frock and the comfort of all
the other dancers. In other words it

some time before she raised her eyes.

"I'll give you absolution now," hÂ«
said, "therefore let the confession pro

' "Well," she said, turning to- the gold
enrod again, "it was simply contrari
ness that made me try the fence. When
I saw it first I was rather faint-hearted.
I fully intended to follow the search
for the gate. Then, when you advised
me not to try it, I was determined to
take it."
Trenholme's eyes sparkled with
amusement, but his voice became sud
denly grave.
"And Dan and I are on the hospital
list in consequence," he said.
"You?" said the girl in surprise.
"Were you hurt? How selfish of ma

"Just after that," he said slowly,
"when I lifted you from the rowan.

He saw her face crimson and her
fingers tighten nervously on the hunt

"There's only one remedy for such
a case." he said.
The voice that answered him was a
wee, small voice.
"Ifâ if it were â mended, would it com

AT HOM E VERSUS "AT HOMES"
ONE of the peculiarities of lan
puage Is the way that certain
words and phrayes have wan
dcrod from their original mean
'ing. "1 believe" is now an expression
of doubt, if used in ordinary conversa
tion apart from a theological meaning.
"Y..ur obedient eervant" will terminate
a Wter of defiance; and "awfully" is
looked upon as the natural adverb to
accompany an expression of enjoyment.
Uelief. obedience, and awe, thus convey
doubt defiance and Jollityâ could Mrs.
Malaprop herself <.u;do this "fine de
rangement of epitaphs." which now
passed muster as the common coin ol
conversation? It is probably, therefore,
owing to this latent inclination *o ver
bal topsy-turviness that we nave
evolved the phrase "at home' to desig
nate a concourse of people who, includ
ing the hostess, never are so little at

society, are amazed when they come
to England, where the habit of intro
ductions 'is out of fashion, or where
they are allowed to wander aimlessly
about without any one showing the
smallest Interest in their presence. The
Continental habit may often be a bore
when It Is overdone, as sometimes hap
pens; but, on the other hand, it is in
spired by the spirit of hospitality and
the desire to make the guests, individ
ually as well as generally, feel at
home, by showing Interest In them, and
giving them, if necessary, fresh ac
quaintances to speak to. Of
years the misnamed "at home" has
reached further development, which
makes its title even.^a greater absurd
ity than before. *
"At homes" are often given not in
the home of the entertainers, but at
some public hall or gallery, such as the
Grafton or New Galleries, or Princes.
The entire absence of any feeling of
personal interest which is the charac
teristic-ln-chief of the modern "at
home" being granted, it must be
owned that the hfred gallery is a dis
tinct gain to most people concerned.
The hostess has the immense relief of
knowing that her entertainment is
simply a question of how much she is
inclined to pay for hire, for floral deco
ration, supper, artists and waiters and
will not entail any upsetting of her pri
vate house. She "presents" her "at
home" as Arthur Collins "presents"
a Drury Lane pantomime; and she re
turns home after it is all over with
the comforting thought that she has
done her social duty with the least
possible trouble to herself. The euests
are equallv the gainers, for, unless the
reception be given in such palaces as
Stafford House, Brldgewater House.
Spencer House or a few of the other
great family mansions of repute, the
ordinary London house, even when of
considerable size, is not well adapted
for the circulation of a crowd. At the
New Gallery or the Grafton. on the
other hand, people can move about at
their ease; and there Is often the addi
tional attraction of a subject of con
versation being gratuitously supplied*
by the pictures exhibited on the walls.

terances -one hears as one passes
through a crowded "at home" they are
absolutely Incapable of originating
one for themselves. This melancholy
fact Is the only Justification for the
Inevitable infliction of music, which is
the most grewsome feature of the or
dinary "at home." The beat form in
which It can be administered is a
string band; it produces the amount of
noise necessary to make the company
chatter like parakeets, and It does not
fill one with sympathetic sadness as
when some unhappy singer Is called
upon to perform amid such surround
ings. For to put a particle of soul Into
a song sung in a room full of a hot
and Indifferent crowd Is about oh a.
par with "wearing one's heart on one's
sleeve for daws to peck at." There
are only two ways for any musician
with an artistic temperament to de
rive enjoyment from his or her gift,
either to be entirely separated and
apart from the audience as on a stag*
In a theater or concert hall, or else
among a small company of Intimate
and understanding friends.
The "at home" gives neither condi
tion, therefore the musician's feelings
suffer, while the hostess desperately
says "Hush!" to procure a moment's
pause, after which the chatter breaks
out again, for It Is one of the most re
markable paradoxes about those who
flock to "at homes" that the less they
really have to say the more they want
to say. It is. indeed, with somewhat
of an underlying feeling: of resentment
that they listen to a really, fine and
continuous programme of musio at an
"at home," if the hostess is so unwise
as to provide It. They much prefer, as
I have said, a string band, which In
cites in them the canary-like desire to
shout it down, or they will listen llks
children to the stories so delightfully
told by those popular favorites. Miss
Helen Marr or Frederick Upton; but
any fine music, vocal or instrumental,
is listened to with a certain amount of
impatience, for it demands concen
trated attention, and concentration of
any kind Is the very last thing the or
dinary "at homer" either wants or Is
capable of.

Justified so great an expenditure? Has
that friend who said he would stand

The same test may be as fairly ap
plied to undertakings and movements
which at their start seemed auspicious

Haa the reform administration in New

its benevolent influence over them?
People or nations who in the" long run

Buch are the abominations of the
miscalled and gregarious "at homes";
fortunately for those who love the so
elety of. threlr kind when well chosen,
there are other houses, few It Is true,
but all the more precious therefore,
where the hostess Is really at home,
and makes her circle of friends and
worshipers feel at home also. A house
where there Is appreciation of every
thing, but most of all of conversation,
of that bright attack and riposte
which Is almost a lost art among* the
"rabble rout" of the formal "at home."
A house where selection of the fittest
Is carried out with Darwinian force,
and where one does not go to air one's

waistcoats, but one's best brains, *â¢-

atmosphere of comprehending sympa
thy which is like a forcing-house for
the wits. A house where every one is
"gey quick at the uptake." where ths
serious questions of the Jay are as
clearly handled as the criticism! on thÂ»
latest play, poem or picture, where
things more than people are the sub
jects of conversation: where men gain
inspiration from the sparkle and poetio
suggestiveness of women, and women
gain strength and lucidity from thÂ«
logic of men.
The foreign habit of certain Intelli
gent hostesses who let their Intimates
know that they are to be found at
home on one particular evening in the
week is an admirable one for forming
a nucleus of Intelligence such as Â»
have described. There is no formal re
ception; a general feeling of Interest
envelops the guests as they drop In,
certain of meeting intelligent personali
ties, of hearing the latest news, liters
ary, political, artistic, or general, dis
cussed with point and freedom* an<i
perhaps some music from those whn>
will only give their best amid certain
surroundings. Just as some orchids give
or withhold their perfume as best
pleases them. An Informal weekly sa
lon of this kind is one of the most
charming social Institutions imagin
able. Fortnightly gatherings are not
the same thing, and many subjects of
Interest and amusement arÂ» stale in a
fortnight; and monthly ones beconxa at
once formal matters of Invitation, and
lose the elemental charm of the weelf.jf
causerle. Such gatherings ar* not In
any way to be confused with thÂ« or*
dlnary afternoon "at home" day, to
which the world's wifÂ« and daughters
are free to go. The evening weekly re
union should be strictly selected, toi
all Its essence and charm Is the- cama
raderie of Intelligence and Intimacy, a
meeting ground for equal brains; and
even a few of ths colossal bores who
bother one and frequent thÂ» ordinary
"at homes" would be sufficient to spell
and upset the whole atmosphere. Per
haps If a few hostesses triad whxt
could be dons on these lines thÂ« ex
pression "at homes" would lose Its ter
rors, and something of the glamour and
charm of the famous salons of bygone
days might yet be revived In thÂ» real

THE MAKING OF
A JOURNALIST
THERE are only two things that
every free-born American citl
xen feel* himself perfectly com
petent to do. One Is to hold
down almost any old office that he can
get hknself appointed or elected to, and
the other that he could run a news
paper If he had the chance. The lat
ter fond Illusion is the only barrier
that stands between many a man and
absolute loss of self-respect. If it were
not for the privilege of writing letters
to various and sundry editors assuring:
them that they are on a straight road
to an asylum for the feeble-minded, the
racks of the unemployed would be
doubled, and If It were not for the
k other fond belief that every man is a
| naturally qualified office-holder the oc
' capations of grand Juries and Congres
sional Investigating committee? would
be gos*.
It is one of the manifestations of the
irony of fate that the men who are
running newspapers are the only men
now in existence who are totally un
qualified for the position* which they
occupy, although the woods are full of
men who could hold up the torch ef
liberty and spread the blessings of a
free and enlightened press broadcast
over the land and contribute to the dis
semination of Intelligence and- Inform
the world as to the score of the last
baseball game or the result of the last
prizefight, and perform the many other
arduous and necessary duties that fall
to the lot of the newspaper chauffeur.
It was Horace Greeley Jones' idea that
he had been picked out by providence
i> to show the world how a newspaper
I should be run, until he tried it. Hav
< Ing had the wisdom to choose a man
for father who had gathered upto him
self rather more than a fair share of
this world's gear, he was not under the
necessity of taking it out in letters to
the editor, but could get Into the ring
and put on the Journalistic gloves him-
Eelf.
It was his idea that a newspaper
ehould be the leader in every high en
terprise and noble endeavor, and that
it should extend the chilly and inhos-

pitable mitt to all such uninteresting
and vulgar matters as murders, train
wrecks and elections in Mississippi.
The best place on the front page should
be given up to a lengthy account of
the proceedings of the last meeting of
the Association for the Suppression of
Human Nature and Dissemination of
Gray Matter and all the editorials
should deal with subjects like the De
velopment of the Subliminal Conscious
ness of Typewriters or the Nature of
the Radio-active Emanations of Cana
dian Thistles. News should be a nuis
ance and the people Bhould be edu
cated to read not what they wanted,
but what they ought to read.
In pursuance of this philanthropic
plan for the cultivation of a polite and
informing Journalism he offered the
managing editorship to that well
known scientist. Professor Micropho
bus, late of the University of Schweit
zerka.se in Germany, and his chief
leader writer was Professor Probeit of
the chair of Unessentials In Podunk
College. Only college graduates whose
sheepskins had a summa cum laude la
bel attached were to be allowed to
gather what passed for news with Ho
race Greeley. In order that there might
be no doubt as to the high and exalted
character of his mission he, named his
paper the Dally Judge. ! Unkind critics
said that it was because the better the
Judge the more difficult It wu to buy
him.
Having gathered together his foroe
of spectacles and encyclopedias who
were to assist him in spreading his gos
pel of unnecessary and unreadable
knowledge over the face of the earth
he bought a few presses and instructed
his men to get busy. His career from
this time on was a living exemplifica
tion of the truth that it is possible to
lead an equine quadruped to water, but
it is a very difficult matter, to make him
buy a newspaper that he doeqn't want.
A glance at the back files of the Daily
Judge will show why Horace Greeley'a
paper wasn't the unqualified success
that that worthy gentleman was sure
it would be. A war broke out* between
two alleged South American republics.

THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALH
but all the notice that the Jones organ
took of the affair was to publish a
long and unquestionably scientificâ at
least, no. one could understand it â arti
cle on the hfstory and anthropological
significance of an Andean tribe that no
one had ever heard of before. While
the baser Journals that pandered to the
desires of the herdâ and seenâprint
ed long dispatches from the seat of
war, the Judge went calmly on |ts
way, giving to a waiting world the lat
est Information on the subject of the
origin of tailless monkeys In the Bra
zilian forests.
At about the same time Washington
was seized with a violent epidemic of
legislation and Jones took advantage
of the opportunity to run a sensation
al and highly Interesting serial oh the
origin of government and the place
occupied in history by the Code Jus
tinian. "While the world was panting
for information on the possibility of
the Soap-Bubble and Crystallized
Smoke trust passing the next quarter
ly dividend, he was regaling his read
ers with extracts from the writings of
the late J. Stuart Aristotle, proving
beyond the shadow. of a doucst that
money was a base and undesirable
thing that should be shunned as Inter
fering with calm contemplation and
the cultivation of repose of soul. A
boiler on a steamboat blew up and
killed fifty people and Horace Greeley
Jones took the platform to explain to
the universe In general the nature of
the expansibility of steam, and why.
But the people who wanted ' to know
how many were killed and what their
names were bought the Dally Howler
and let the scientific dissertations in
the Judge go by on the other side of
the street.
These are only a few. samples of the
manner in which Horace Greeley
Jones sized uo the public taste and
then gave it something that It didn't
want." He was proceeding Jon the as
sumption that the ~taste4 for informa
tion and instruction^ and" olives and
caviare and other disagreeable things
could be acquired by diligent anil re
peated applications. Where lie made
his mistake "was "in forgetting that

around the corner andjbougnt the
Howler, in order that their feelings
might be properly harrpwed up and
their particular kind of news hunger
appeased. . ' v
Finally, when the advertising had
fallen to a half -column . undertaker's
ad. <n trade and the subscriptions had
dropped to at' least fifty per da7, prin
cipally among the inmates of old
women's homes, Horace Greeley de
cided that the time was ripe for him to
retire from the newspaper business and
go into something that he didn't know
so much about. In accordance with
this pious resolution he sold the plant,
furniture and fixtures and good will,
including a high-power microscope for
the purpose of locating the latter, to a
soulless wretch, whose highest ideal
was to pay his debts and taxes and
educate his children without unusual
expense to the community. Be'injr, as
we have suggested, a base mercenary,
he put in the most of the first day
practicing on a chest weight, to be
able to fire the men whom Horace
Greeley had gathered around him.
.Then he proceeded to gather in a few
choice eouls who could make the ac
count of a dog fight read like a novel,
and whose ambitions were to write
stuff that would sell the paper. The
name of the sheet became the Daily
Bazoo; it was further concealed be
hind headlines that could be read
across the street after dark, and car
toons that would have made an Egyp
tian mummy turn Its head.
It is no palliation of the new own
er's offenses to say that the paper paid
for itself from the start, and that the
editor-has already founded two uni
versities and a home for broken-down
scientists out of his profits. It only
goes to show that the man who starts
out to give the people what they ought
to have Instead of what they want
needs to be well endowedâ at least
with common-senseâ before he begins.
And if he is so endowed, he will never
undertake the contract.

TALE OF THE GUY
WHO SPRINTED
ONCE upon a time there lived In
the town of Pelt Center,' which
is a regular stop on a Southern
road, a party of the name of
Luther Ltvermore.
Lu.her was the he- belle of the burg.
He wore Primrose and West shirts,
pats with polka dot cloth uppers, mani
cured his nails, smoked monogramme<l
Turkish student lamps and talked
about actresses.
It came to pass that Luther's father
had a fight to a finish with a spell of
sickness and lost the decision. When
the Life Insurance Company was put
wise to the fact that the bout was on
the level and the verdict was a popular
one, they settled with the widow with
out going to court, and as Luther was
the only child and his mamma's pre
cious darling, she split the purse with
him.
When it became noised around Pelt
Center ihat the check had arrived the
storekeepers Invited Luther to stop in
and sign, tabs, and the young ladies
made it plain that they would be
charmed to have him drop In of an
evening.
Before It was time to rip the black
band off his sleeve Luther had writ
er's cramp and an option on a girl
named Lucille. The widow had noth
ing, the tailor had a dispossess notice,
the confectioner had doubts, the Jewel
er had hopes and Lucille had spark
lers. â/' -
As long as Luther kept the kids busy
carrying bonbons and blossoms to
Lucille all .was well, but when he had
shot his bolt there came a change in
the betting, and the wise ones tum
bled to the fact that he was due to
lose his forfeit.
When Luther got a hunch that Lu
cille was going to transfer, assign, con
vey, set over and release all of her
right, title and interest in and to her
cardiacal regard to one Ruf us Has
son, he out, up an awful howl.
He exuded the opinion that she was
not on the square and that she was
handing him the double cross for ths
reason that his father had neglected to
carry a million dollar policy. He set
up the claim that she did not possess
a~ marketable title to her seat of affec
tion, for the reason that she had ac
cepted sundry and divers goods, chat-

tels and effect* from him, and that In
consideration of tha delivery unto her
of the said sundry and divers goods,
chattels and effects, she had by Insinu
ation, intimidation. Innuendo, utter
ance, action, pledge and promise caused
him to feel, believe, imagine. Infer and
conclude by both Inductive and de
ductive reasoning that he was to ac
quire and attain exclusive tltla. owner
ship, mastery and proprietorship of her
heart, and that he and he only was
to reserve to himself full power, con
trol, domain and command over the
i-M heart, and that he. and he only,
v-a.3 to be and to be known as the sole
and only lord, master, king; floor
walker and main squeeze of the said
Lucille.
He said it was up to Lucille to call all
bets off with Rufus Hasson and to In
form him that It would be good for him
to open up negotiations In some other
clime. He remarked that no gentleman
would trespass upon another's pre
serves, especially when **No Hunting"
placards in Tiffany settings were shin
ing all over the premises, and that he
would take a fall out of the afore-men
tioned Rufus Hasson if he did not show
a high rate of speed In transferring his
affections to some other brain-con
fuser.
"When Luther eased up to catch a
breath of air Lucille gazed meditatively
upon her Jeweled hands and said: "My
dear, 'tis your own fault. In the early
part of the going you were winning on
the bit. The pace you set was bewitch
ing, fascinating and entrancing. It waa
faultless in every detail. The present
were coming thick and fast, and 1
looked as though you could go the full
distance without pulling up lame. Bu
no, you couldn't. You were all In be
fore the heavy going came In sight.
While I like you, and am grateful t
you for the presents, I can never for
give you for the humiliation you have
caused me to> suffer by playing your
hand out so early In the game. I shall
always take great pleasure in speaking
kindly of you for your goodness in the
past, but I opine that I would experi
ence quit- some difficulty If I endeav
ored to bask my feathers in the sun
shine of yesterday. . So I guess It be
hooves me to play the rest of my hand
out with Rufus Hasson."
Moral: You cannot win on a hand
that has once been played.

wight who happened to fall
in love in those unenlight
ened days when the malady was really
considered formidable! The man was
looked upon as in a serious plight, who
was thus stricken, even here in our
own West, in those days before the
Yankees came among the senors and
ftidalgos to teach how cavalierly this
illness should be treated, how speedily
the remedy may be obtained and a per
manent cure effected. To the lover of
Alta California it was an affair of mo
ment to take unto himself a bride. In
deed, he devoted so much time â  and
thought to the enterprise that it was
he, perhaps, who furnished the founda
tion for the myth concerning the seri
ousness of matrimony generally. How
ever that may be, he presents an awful
picture, upon which the up-to~dat*
lover can hardly look without shudder
ing and thanksgiving. Such a view is.
however, occasionally wholesome for
him as showing bow much worse his
own lot might have been. After srazins:
upon it he will forever discount his
own trials and wear a cheerful coun
tenance even when ordering the
chaperon's supper!
It is difficult for us to realize that
â¢ven such a short time ago as during
the lÂ£20's the settlements of Alta Cali
fornia attempted to reflect, like so
many small mirrors, the life of Madrid,
and that just as the Calif or nians
hitched oxen to their plows because "it
was so done by our fathers in Spain,"
â¢o they married and gave in marriage
after a modification of the Spanish
mode. ,In those days the city plaza
often formed the stage setting for the
first act of a love affair. Little by little
the candles and lanterns had begun to'
glimmer forth around the square,
where the aguardiente seller and the
monte player were bringing their tables
out in front of their booths. Among the
trees the violins and guitars were tun-
Ing up. and the little fountain in the
center of the square braced up for the
occasion and did its level best to make
the plaza look like a square in old
THE BOAT AND THE BODY
Watch a noble boat glide into the
â water. It is as strong as can possibly
be built from wood and Iron, after the
most perfect pattern. It must be btrong.
that for years it may be able to hold
together, until the last harbor is
reached. Unless it is strong there can
be no voyage. Whether driven by wind
or by steam is of secondary importance.
So it is jvitb the human body. To suc
cessfully sail over life's rough sea it
must be 6trong and rugged. The
amount of canvas, the power of the
engines, and other factors will deter
mine the rapidity of the boat's pro
gress. The energy, the enthusiasm, the
persistency of the individual will deter
mine :*. what rate he will advance.
But without the sound body neither the
voyage of the boat nor that of the child
can be successful.
It may be that no one can say what
vitality is. Some say that it is nerve
force; others that it is a force fed by
air Â«nd assimilation, and that it acts
through the nerves. Be this as it may,
all must agree that" it Is the measure
of capacity for success. >Â«o child can
Madrid. With the growing dusk the
pleasure-seekers strolled into the plaza,
and soon the air was filled with laugh
ter, chatter and song. Had we been in
San Diego/ for instance, on such a
night we would have noticed among the
aristocrats one particular maiden with
blacker eyes, redder lips and more im
posing flounces than her sisters, and
have his share of success unless he
is perfectly healthy. It is the glory of
a child who is well. As. the child's
success depends upon vitality, so does
his vitality depend upon a strong
body. If these things are so is it not
of vast importance that parents j see
to it that every provision is made' for
the developing of strong bodies?
The mind is that in us which
knows, feels and wills. Therefore the
training of the child's mind means
not only the furnishing of. the, mind
with knowledge, but it also means the
culture of the feelings and the devel
opment of the will. From earliest
childhood the mind drinks in knowl
edge through the- senses of smell,
touch, taste, sight and hearing. By
means of the senses the child per
ceives that there is a world outside of
itself. To a limited extent tfie child
quite early remembers. Later the
faculties of memory, imagination,
conception, judgment and reasoning
becomes active.
. Primarily the. child gains all its in
formation through the senses. * If but
would have been told that -that waÂ»

of the hidalgo whose ' broad -acres
stretched from the "sea almost to the

name of the young Don Martinez at

course, would have turned a deaf ear. .

two circles always face to face. Here
was the opportunity for the enterpris
ing. '**â  Of course there, was the roboso,
fan and mantilla to screen" the inner
circle from the too interested scrutiny
of the outer, but what hero with a
name like Martinez Estudillo Arguello
Echeandia would be baffled by a piece
of black lace? At one of these prome
nade's, then, the lordly eye of Echeandia
fell . upon Senorita Inez, and imme
diately he burned with a consuming
passion, as was customary. When the
senorita was returning home under the
escort of a battalion of sisters, cousins
an.d aunts, Echeandia followed at a
respectful distance and discovered the
abode of his Inamorata. After that he
lit a cigarrito and strolled back to the
square, pondering what he could stake
on monte, for ready money he must
have if he intended falling in love, and
his nreserit resources were â well, it
would have been extremely ungenteel
for a gentleman of his rank to be pos
sessed of anything but debts, and
Echeandia was in the height of the
fashion*. On the monte table, then, he
staked his gold mounted poinard (we
will assume it was paid for), spent his
last real in aguardiente and sat down
to 'decide his fate. Had he lost his
love story would have come to "an
abrupt termination, but fortune, Â£with
the old weak spot in her heart for a
lover, sat by his side.
At any rate, the next day Echeandia
was preparing to attack the fortifica
tions that surrounded the senoriia,
namely, Senor .Herrera and all the
brothers and uncles. This might re
quire months of strategy, 'and even
after the breastworks were won, even
after the garrison had capitulated, the
lady for .whom he had fought the good
fight he saw, but seldom, and then only
in the presence of her relatives assem
bled. History does not. precisely
record the emotions of the senorita, as
they were matters of quite secondary
importance, but if she was a true Cas
tllian maiden it is safe trf assume that
before how she had implored the saints
for a husband, addressing her suppli
cations to St. Anthony after the unique
Spanish fashion by throwing a little
image of that revered celibate into the
well, saying: "Lie there. St. Anthony,
and drink'water till thou has found me
a husband!" Perhaps at this stage of
the proceedings she fished up the saint
as a reward of merit.
If Echeandia adopted the approved
method of courtship imported from
Mexico he now began -to "play the
bear," that is, he took up his stand out
side the Herrera dwelling and waited
hour after hour with the hope of seeing
his Juliet pass on the balcony that ran
across the upper part of the. house. Up
and down he would pace and perhaps
receive one signal, in a long afternoon!
Can Fifth avenue display a devotion
like unto this? Then, too, he might
meet her in the market place with her
duenna, when she would wave to him
by fluttering her hand' back' and forth
before her eyes "with an enticing ges
ture," as an old observer called it.
These views of his charmer were sup
posed to satisfy him. unless fortune
again befriended him and inveigled
Senor del Herrera into taking his fam
ily to a rodeo at the rancho of some
relative, whither so gallant a lover as
Echeandia thought nothing of riding a
hundred miles to "tread but one meas
ure" with the senorita through the
mazes of the contradanza. On his ar
rival his host probably fell on his neck
and kissed both cheeks, sayinp, "You
are welcome. Don Martinez; my house
is at your command, â¢ my horses are
yours, my wine Is yours, my relatives
are your relatives; you are at home!"
But woe to the suitor if, thus en
couraged, he for one moment treated
the senorita as if she were his cous.n
four times removed. As it was, the
three days' merrymaking probably
ended for him in a due.lo. not neces
sarily, that there was anything par
ticular to fight about, but it was a
social duty that young men of pre
tensions could not afford to omit. But
If he was thus pinked for Her sake, let
us hope that he was rewarded by thÂ«
â¢enoritas laying aside her dignity for
the occasion and joining In the general
celebration of the fandango, even in
the dancing, when Echeandia would be
sure to have a hand in showering ier
with silver dollars at the close of h-r
performance; or maybe he placed his
hat upon her head, meaning he would
redeem It with a present. Perhaps at
this time. too. Senor Herrera sometimes
turned his back and the duenna went
to sleep It would be depressing, other
wise to think of all the good California
moonlight that was wasted in thosa
days.
After the rodeo certainly Eche
andia's place was firmly established in
the family, and it was probably as they
journeyed home that the senorlta's
fate was sealed by Herrera's word.
Let us. like the rest of the world, as
sume that she approved of the paternal
taste and was happy when her father
mentioned the day.
The wedding took place at the mis
sion church at the fashionable hour
just before daybreak, and was followed
by a wedding breakfast ofâ Imagineâ
beef, tortillas and frijoles! On account
of his great wealth Senor Herrera
added to this spread chocolate and
sugar from Mexico. After this what
was lacking to lift the bride to the pin
nacle of human happiness? There were
no rice showers, but their place waÂ»
taken by ess shells filled with colojrne.
which greeted the bridal pair from un
expected quarters with "sweet drench

rera's tables were spread and respread
for the friends, relatives and all thÂ«
uninvited but expected countryside:
for three nights Herrera'0 house was
bright with wax tapers and the violins
and guitars never* ceased. After this
the father withdrew his hand from the
rudder of the matrimonial bark. Eche

vu a 5R.c;a'Moiis, ch-ar-headed man.
He understood the necessity of putting
clean nr'n to run for office. On one
occasion he stood out against, the solici
tations an>l remonstrances of a great
railroad corporation, which insisted
upen thÂ» nomination of a certain law
yer fcr the Supreme benrh. "The peo
ple will beat him and he will hurt the
ticket," t'i'A Hifzcins. "His record will
not bear the lis!u."
T*t Hiepins was not disdainful of the
Â»Â«rv!c*Â» of discredited men. nor un
rraf'fu! for such services when per
formed. On or.e occasion he had named
for* a clerkchip in a public office a cer

members of the committee remor.Ptrat

said Hipgins, "th? man can do no harm
in that place. It is not possible for
him to steal a cent. He can perform
its duties perfectly and he needs the
position." "Rut, Mr. Higgles." said one
of the committee, "the man is a scoun
drel." "Yes, I know." rejoined the boss,
"but he is our scoundrel and has got
to be taken care of."
Hippins never broke a promise, and
it is recorded of him that never but
once did he fail to "deliver the goods,"
and that was because the scepter was
twisted from his hand and the slate
smashed by an accident. It was in the
summer of 18S6. The Republican State
Convention met at Los Angeles to nom
inate a State ticket. There were four
candidates for the nomination for Gov
ernor. Or.e of these. General W. H.
Dimond cf San Francisco, a Civil War
veteran, was supported by Higgins, but
he was unable to obtain many of the
country delegates. General Dimond had
a warm personal friend who often took
the stump for the Republican ticket.
but who never participated otherwise
in politics, and who had not been for
many years a member of a convention.
General Dimond : greatly desired that
this gentleman should make a speech
to the convention seconding his nom
ination, and upon his consent to do so
Boss Higgins provided him with a
proxy. f
The convention, consisting of more
than 600 members, assembled at Los
Angeles. A protracted fight was made
oyer the nomination for Governor, and
nominating and seconding speeches,
including one from General Dimond's
friend, were made. But the railroad in
fluence was against the general, and at
last he was compelled to withdraw and
a compromise candidate received thÂ«
nomination. Higgins arranged the
"deal." and as a part of the arrange
ment it was agreed that all the rest of
the Higgins "slate" should go through,
and a politician from Central Califor
cia was slated for the nomination for
Attorney General. "
Anaonc the unslated candidates for
tha efflce was a San Francisco lawyer.
He bed not six delegates In a conven

practically no chance. He was slightly
acquainted with the gentleman who
had vainly spoken in behalf of the nom

Governor and the principal offices the
aspirant for Attorney General sought
General Dimond's friend and requested
him to make a sjÂ»eech placing him in
nomination. "I don't think. I can do
that." was the reply. "I came here for
only one purposeâ to speak in behalf

workers having done all they can, it

There have always been those who

admit that anything is "up to them."

candidate that is on his elate."
"That," said the aspirant, with some
heat, "does not comnort with what
you said in seconding the nomination
of General Dlmond. You said that in
any contest between a UnionT soldier
and a civilian you would, othen things
being equal, support the soldier."
â¢'Were you a soldier?" inquired the
gentleman addressed.
Then the candidate told to the del
egate the story which the latter, two
hours later, to.ld to the convention.
When the convention -reassembled
it occurred to the delegate that. aÂ»
cording to^politica! ethirs. he ought
not to use the proxy, given him by
IlijTsins to speak and vote in behalf
of a candidate not on the slate; so he
turned to his "colleague." a rising

"Will you oblige me fcy swing to Mr,

Rack came the obliging messenger.
"It's all right;" said he. "The boss

your speech; that it won't m:ike no
difference nohow, for the shte candi

"Did he tell you to tell me thit

"Well, no, not that way altogether."
"Will you please state exactly what
he did say?"
"Well, if you want the straight tip,
what he did say was this; "Let him
Mow, it will amuse tha boys and
it won't make no difference what he
says, for a majority of the convention
is fixed solid for our man."
The delegate said no more, but took
his seat and began to prow white about
the Mrs. If his thoughts had been
voiced they would have been something
as follows: "Have I carried the banner
of my party and labored for its success
for twenty years and more; have I held
with credit seats in Ftate and Federal
Legislatures, to be told by this brute of
a saloon-keeper, this political 'boss."
that nothing that I can say will have
any effect upon a Republican "conven
tion?" And then as the nominations for
Attorney General were called for th<j.
delegate waited until the names of all
the other candidates had been placed
before the convention, and then, sur
charged with passion; but outwardly
calm, he ascended the rostrum and this
is what he. said:
"We have passed resolutions in favor
of the soldiers, we have commended
their conduct, we admire their patriot
ism, we glory in their sacrifices, but we
have not nominated any of them for of
fice. I have a little story to tell this
convention. It was related to me an
hour or so ago, and I have no reason
to doubt that it is a true story.
"In January. 1S62, an orphan boy,
then 14 year* of age, attempted to en-,
list in the Union army. He was de
nied admission on account of his youth,
but was able to join a company of Un
ion scouts recruited mainly from Ten
nessee and Northern Georgia.
"On the second day. of the battle of
Missionary Ridge it had been arranged
that at 1 o'clock Sherman, In command^
of the left, should make an attack upon
Bragg's army. But through the treach
ery or carelessness of a war corre
spondent of a Cincinnati paper the code
of Union signals had fallen into the
possession of the Confederates. The
Union scouts, ever -vigilant, ascertained
this fact and reported it to General
Grant at 11 o'clock of the morning of
the day at 1 o'clock in the afternoon
of which the attack was to be made.
"It became necessary to countermand
the order previously given and to di
rect a different movement of the
forces and the code was useless. - It
was necessary to send a written mes
sage to Sherman, who was, by a cir
cuitous route, fourteen miles distant,
and two messengers were dispatched
by that route. But there was grave
doubt as to whether they would reach
General Sherman in time, and volun
teers were called for who should-go
through the Confederate lines, it be-Â»
ing only six miles across by that
route. <
"The boy of whom I speak volun
teered for the service. With the mes
sage wrapped in tin foil, secreted in
his mouth, ready to be swallowed in
case he was c: ntured. and clad in a
mountaineer's dress of gray, he start
ed upon his mission. He took his life
in his hands, for if captured he. would
have been shot as a spy. By his wit
and his quickness and his bravery he
succeeded. He went through the
Confederate lines, â¢ twice questioned,
by his ready answers claiming to be a-
Confederate dispatch bearer, he es
caped detection. At the last he was
three times fired at. He went down
â¢into the Jaws of death.' He went
down "into the mouth of hell.' He
reached Sherman, he delivered the
a farmhouse ten miles from a railway
wcruld put forth her best energies If
she only were in the midst of the gold
en opportunities of the city. But the
city man â¢ who has fallen behind the
procession says to himself: "Oh, if I
could only get out into the country
where there are not so many appli
cants for every Job. Then I could
amount to something, but there is no
show for me in this crowded- place."
The Door man says: â¢ How easy it
would be. to live a virtuous and useful
life if I were rich." While the man of
wealth sighs: "Oh. for a little home
and fewer cares. Then I might lead a
truer, simpler life."
Moreover, we. are all more or less
under the fascination of the modern
ideas of the function of the state. We
are disposed to appeal to the city or
the national Government to do things
for us. We are enamored with 'the
thought of a liberal, paternalistic pub
lic policy by means or which we may
get the snow shoveled off our side
walks and our houses lighted and
warmed without costing us a cent.
Against both of these ideas â that of
shifting responsibility on fate and that
of depending on the state or on some
beautiful, socialistic status â this clear
cut little phrase rings out a sharp pro
test. There Is as much opportunity and
as great a call in modern life for the
message and the proposed attack was
abandoned, although ShVrman, as di
rected, kept up a heavy cannonading,
in order to deceive Bragg. The boy
noticed as he was passing through
the Confederate lined that Bragg was
weakening his right in order to march
his forces to the left to resist the sup
posed attack of Sherman. He report
ed this fact to Sherman, who there
upon with Sheridan made an attack
upon Bragg's weakened left, and then
came that celebrated attack upon the
rifle pits, .which ended when the sun
went down with our flag floating upon
the heights of Missionary Ridge.
"Gentlemen of the convention,- while
in the history of our war the names
of the generals who commanded great
movements, nnd of the heroes who ex
ecuted them will" go down to posterity,
there Is another book, not written ! by
man. in which the name" of that 16
year-old boy will be written in letters
of light.
"He fought through the war and re-,
maine-j in the service until mustered
out when peace was declared. Dur
ing the last six months of his service
he carried a volume of Blackstone in
his knapsack and thus began the
study of law. After peace was de
clared he continued his studies.' He.
was admitted in Iowa. He has prac
ticed* for twelve years in San Fran
i ipoo. He has established an honored
position at the bar of California.
â "Oentlcmt.'n, I present to you for thi'
office rf Attorney General, not In the
name of any siate or combination, but
I present to you fn the name of the sol
diers of this republic, hitherto neglected
in this Republican convention; I pre
sent to you in the name of those who
unveiled the current of the Mississippi,
who battled above the clouds at Look
out Mountain, who sang the song of
triumph from Atlanta to the se"a, who
carried our banner, blood-spotted and
bullet-shredded, but flying # still tri
umphant over all this land. I present
to you now for nomination the un
starred, unepauletted hero of Mission
ary Ridge."
The story was a simple one, simply
told. There was no ornateness and no
attempt at oratory. It was not an In
credible story, for there were many
such instances of unrewarded and un
recorded heroism during our Civil War.
The personality of the speaker had lit
tle to do with the, narration. He was
behind his theme and not in front of it.
It was the deus ex machina that ruled
the hour. The stone was rolled from
the sepulcher of the past and the pas
sionate patriotism of the Civil War,
dormant for twenty years, arose with
the song of battle upon its lips. The
members tf the convention shouted
and waved their hats and stood up on
their seats and shouted again. The
'"slate" was smashed Into fragments.
A few lieutenants of the "boss" who
attempted to reason with the excited
delegates were cried down. . The roll
was called. ' The first county on the list
was Alamedaâ a slate county .with its
100. delegates* supposed to be- -in -the
pocket of the "boss." But when ltd
long, lean chairman arose and cast its'
vote solid for Vthe unepauletted "lefo of*
Missionary Ridge" the cheering "/as re
sumed, and when the roll call was fin
ished the candidate for Attornej* Gen
eral, who fifteen minutes before could
count but six delegates for his sup
porters, .was practically the unanimous
choice of 600.
"I bad always thought," said General
W. H. L. Barnes after the convention
adjourned, "that Grant and Sherman
had something to do with the battle of
Missionary Ridge, but I am satisfied
now it was our nominee for Attorney
General."
Some Question as to the truth of the
story was made by the opposition pa
pers, but the Grand Army officers in
vestigated it and indorsed it. The can
didate thus nominated suffered defeat
at the polls with the rest of the ticket;
but at the next State convention he
was again selected as a candidate, "on
the ghost of a nominating speech," as
was said, and was elected and served
with credit for four years.
There was politics in the land In
those days. * In Southern California
even the excitement of a boom could
not silence the voice of the spellbinder.
"My friends," said a Democratic speak
er, "you should all vote for that
gr-r-reat statesman, Grover Cleveland,
not merely because you will continue
him in place, but you will also retain
In tfie White House that brilliant lady,
Mrs. Cleveland, and whatever partisan
malice may 6ay against Grover. we all
know that there are no . files on
Frankie."
"Mr. Blaine," said a satirical speaker,
"was so fond of marrying the mother
of his first born that he married her
twice."
"That," rejoined his opponent, "Is the
difference between the Presidential can-
Individual ; as .... ever before In the
world's history. Individual initiative
Individual responsibility; individual
burden-bearing and duty-doing are
the things to emphasize to-day. Every
man is still the architect of his own
fortune/and in the truest sense of the
word the captain of his own, industry
It is a glorious thought to keep in
mind during these opening days of the
new year. A plain, blunt farmer
came up to. Daniel Webster after one
of his great speeches and said: "Dan
iel, you haven't done your best yet"
None of us has yet displayed all his
mettle. None of us has been as faith
ful to routine duty, as punctual in his
engagements, as thorough In meth
ods, as cheerful in his demeanor aa
useful in his church or his community
as he yet may be. It is "up. to him"
in these and other particulars this
coming year. -
And maybe some men need Just the
impetus of this phrase to carry them
over the line into the sphere of the life
which we call moral and Christian. A
friend, a schoolmate, a Sunday-school
teacher, a pastor, may take you by the
hand to the point where you" gather
up all vour energies and unreservedly
commit yourself to the best that has
been revealed to you Of God and duty.
But you, and you only, must take the
final step.

- J^ thought that possibly a selec
tion of a few of the trenchant
and amusing , remarks that . brighten
the pages 'of this very up-to-date
work might prove interesting to you.
A business man's conversation should
be regulated by â  simple rulesâhave
something to eay, say It, then stop
talking. Give fools, the first and women
the last word, and bear In mind that it's
easier to look wise than to talk wis
dom. A fellow and his business should
be bosom friends in the office and
strangers but of it. A clear mind Is one
that Is swept clean of business at 6
o'clock every night and 'not opened up
again till the shutters are taken down
next morning.
If you wish to be successful in. busi-
ness y'qu'mus.t know your goo-da from
A to Z.- You must know 'em like a
young -mother knows baby talk, and
be "as proud of "em as the young fath
er of, a .twelve-pound child, without
really thinking that you've added your
pounds,' ; You've got to have the scent
of a "bloodhound tor; an order and the
grip of a bulldog oh a customer. You've
got . to , feel .the same . personal solici

when a'feliovhas that half he finds
it's the other half which would really
come in handy. . .
I don't' know anythlnc. that a young
business man k ohght to keep v more to
himself than his dislikes, unless It's his

either, i but it's* bankruptcy to tell about

There Isn't 'any* such thing as being

take your choice, but remember, the
more sport the' less money. The most
important step in a man's life is mar
riage, and when a young fellow takes
that step on' a small salary It is a
proof* "that ; he* requires a keeper
more th*h a wife.* Af t*r all, there is
no fool like a young fool, because he's

To marry for money or to marry
without money is a crlm*. There's no
real objection * to maxrylnr & woman
with a fortune, but ther* is to marry
ing; a woman for a fortuna. WhU* you
are at it there's nothing Ilk* plcklnj
out a good looking wlft, because aven
the handsomest woman looks plain
sometimes, so you get a llttl* pleasant
variety, but a plain on* can only vary
by looking worse than usual and there'*
no pleasure In that variaty. Of court*
beauty Is only skin deep, but that's
deep enough to satisfy any en* man.
Then, too. If a fellow's bound to marry
a fool, and a lot of men have to If
they're going to hitch up Into a well
matched pair, there's nothing like pick
ins one; It's less regret.*
Be particular In your dress. Of eourt*
clothes don't make the man, but thay
make all of him except his hands and
face, and that's a pretty considerable
area of the human animal. A dirty
shirt may hide a pure heart, but It sel
dom ' covers a clean skin. We know.*
that appearances are deceitful, but *o
long as they are there's nothing Ilk*
having them deceive for us instead of
against us. I've seen a 10-cent shave

In this world it isn't enough to be all

Whatever may be your success never
lose sight of your own faults. Authority'
swells up some fellows so that they
can't see their own corns, but a wue
man is not only able to attend to bis
own corns, but he carefully avoids
treading on his neighbor's. It's a grooi
thing to step back from yourself and
see how you look. Then deduct 50 par
cent for faults that you missed in your
investments and add ' 50 per cent to
your estimate of your neighbor for
virtues that you can't see and you'll
have a pretty accurate result, which
you are not bound to publish.

GWENDOLEN MAXWELL, AS THE WIFE OF THE DUKE
OF NORFOLK, WILL BE ENGLAND'S RICHEST DUCHESS
Besides the Highest Position in Britain's Society She
Will Become Mistress of the Kingdom's
Greatest of Ancient Castles.
LONDON, Feb. 6.â It was all right
about the Duke of Marlborough, and
the Duke of Manchester, and the Duke
of Roxburghe. but if the Duke of Nor
folk, who heads the whole ducal list,
had followed their example and en
gaged himself to an American girl,
jbm rumor persistently credited him with
doing; If he had done that ! But
\i is Impossible to eet down on paper
any indication of the chorus of com
ment and criticism that such a deed
would have aroused. Perhaps the wise
and elderly Duke took warning In
time; otherwise If he proposed to
Gladys Deacon, as the gossips said he
would, that lovely daughter of the
bUltb and stripes refused him, 'the no
fcle Duke being no longer young, and
never having been what you could
honestly call good looking, and being
known, furthermore, as the most care
lessly dressed man In the whole peer
age.
At any rate, the announcement of
the marriage cf the Premier Duke of
â¢England early In February to his young
cousin, the Honorable Gwendolen Con
stable Maxwell, set at rest much un
easiness en the part of British society
mammas â especially those of the Ro
man Catholic faith. Miss Maxwell was
born in exactly the yearâ 1S77â In which
the Duke was married to his first wife,
who died ten years afterward. Her
mother was the Duke's first cousin, and
her father. Lord Herries, came of a
Scottish line almost as old as that of
the Duke himself, and connected with
bin by several ties of marriage.
The match is of real interest, even
across the Atlantic, for It means that
a gentle, religious and somewhat retir
ing girl will Jump from a minor place
. in the upper circle of British society
to the highest hereditary rank next to
royalty. Even the Duchess of Marl
borough will have to make vray for the
wife of the Premier Duke, who out
ranks on the table of precedence every
body after royalty and Embaesadors,
except a few ex-offlcio big-wigs whose
ilace is appointive and not hereditary.
Furthermore, she becomes mistress of
one *f the greatest, and certainly the
most glorious, of castles in all Great
Britain, and what is probably the most
perfect mediaeval fortress now stand
ing.
DUKE'S FAMOUS OLD CASTLE.
The famous old pile, which was built
late in the eleventh century, still bears
the name of Arundel, the family who
made it their eeat for nearly S50 years.
In 1ES0 It came into the Howard fam
ily, of which the present Duke of Nor
folkâthe fifteenth of his lineâ is the
head, and although eome additions have
been made, much of the ancient part
Btlll stands. The great Norman keep,
rising to a Eheer height of 150 feet,
probably could not now withstand the
terestlng points In centuries past, es
to be united have touched at many ln
elegea it did in the twelfth and six
teenth centuries, but the old walls are
good for many years yet. In 1791 a
Gothic edifice was built around the
mediaeval tower, and this contains
most of the living rooms in use to-day.
Tou can get everything from pictur
esque ruin to luxurious comfort within
the Trails of Arundel. the Duke havjng
recently restored, with a careful hand,
some portions of the castle to make it
more habitable for the poor, crippled
boy who was the heir to all the Nor
folk wealth and glory, and whose In
firmities kept him practically a prison
er In this splendid palace until death
came to his release last year.
Everything that a father's love could
devise, or that the wealth of one of
the richest nobles in England could
buy. was done to nave the boy. When
he xvas a child his mother, the first
Duchess, even took him to Lourdes to
see If the sacred Bhrlne would not per
form the miracle that medicine had
failed in. The story goes that as they
â were approaching the place a party of
peasants celebrating the cure of one of
their number passed the Duchess on
their way back from the shrine chant-
Ing: "He hath filled the hungry with
g-ood things and the rich he hath sent
away empty." The Duchess turned
pa<IIy to her companions and said:
"That is our answer, for we are the
rich. There will be no miracle for us."
The boy was the only child of the
Duke, and unless the new Duchess pro
vides an heir the title and vast es
tates will pass to Lord Edmund Tal
bof. a younger brother of the present
Duke.
We shall probably see a marked
change in the solemn, stuffy dignity
of St. James square, of which the mosÂ£
notable feature Is Norfolk House, the
preat town residence of the Duke. The
mansion has been practically closed
ever since the death of the first
Duchess, sixteen years ago, and has
come to look somewhat gloomy and
dingy. But now It is to take on new
life and color, and is expected to be
come one of the most brilliant social
centers in London. Its proprietor stage
managed the coronation, the most bril
liant social function of our time, just
as his ancestors for some hundreds of
years before him had arranged for all
previous coronations â a hereditary
cright with the Norfolks. With such
experience and such social rank the
Duke can be depended upon to make
up for his long retirement from soci
ety with some entertainments that are
likely lo be. memorable. Norfolk House
is almost as historic as Arundel Castle.'
It was in this house that the chief au
thor of the American Revolution,
George III. was born, in 1728, his par
ents having been turned out of St.
James Palace by George IL Many a
page of history has been made within
its walls.
GREAT FAMILY HISTORIES.
The histories of the two great Ro
man Catholic families which are about
pecially at the great battle of Flodden
Field, which the second Duke of Nor
folk won, and In which the second Lord
Henries was killed, while, fighting un
der Norfolk. The first Duke died fight
ing for Richard III at Bosworth;' the
third was beheaded by Henry VIII; the
fourth was beheaded at the Tower of
London for communication with Mary.
Queen of Scots; and his eldest son died
a prisoner In the Tower in 1695.
The present Duke, who celebrated his
fifty-seventh birthday a fortnight ago.
would have kept up the warlike tradi
tions of his family If he could have
had a chance. He was Postmaster Gen
eral of England when war was de
clared !n the Transvaal, and in spite
of the protests of his friends, and lack
of enthusiasm on the part of the War
Office, there was nothing to do but
that he must resign and go to the front
to show his patriotism. Dukes are not
greatly wanted In the firing line, and
although the Norfolk courage and sin
cerity was undoubted, his Grace was
persuaded after a time to return home.
I suppose there isn't in all England
to-day a more comfortable, easy-going
and unostentatious peer than the
present representative of all the Nor
folk glories. His habit of going about
in a Back coat and slouch hat, with his
long, black whiskers flying, has led to
many an amusing mistake on tne part
of folk who didn't know him.
THE DUKE IS CARELESS.
There are stories "of tourists who
have encountered him roaming about
the grounds of Arundel Castle and have
offered him small tips for email cour
tesies extended, and there is a well
authenticated account of his being
turned away from the door of an in
stitution for the poor on one occasion
when it had been announced that the
Duke of Norfolk would be present to
distribute certain prizes. The door
keeper told a . somewhat __ disheveled
man who had elbowed his way through'
the crowd to 'the door that he ought to
know they did not distribute relief to
the poor on a day like that. "I quite
understand," said the man, "but you
do distribute prizes, and I have come
down to distribute them for you."
On another occasion when the Duke
was heading a distinguished party on a
pilgrimage to the Vatican he was mis
taken by a tourist on the platform for
one of Cook's men and commanded to
look after her luggage. As she was
much flustered and In need of assist
ance, the Duke politely carried her bag
for her, to the vast delight of his titled
escort, and It is doubtful if that tour
ist knows to this day why It was that
her porter refused a tip.
The new Duchess is one of the few
women In England who will succeed
to a title of her own, as the Scotch
barony of Herrles will descend to her
after her father's death. It is a proud
old line and it Is almost a pity that
the title doubtless will be absorbed
eventually in the long list of Norfolk
titles. The Duke is already Earl of
Arundel, Earl of Surrey, two or three
barons and half a dozen other things.
TARKIXGTOXS ARE KNOWN
AS "DUKE AND DUCHESS"
Natives of Capri Arc Awe-Stricken at
the Generosity of the Ameri
can Novelist.
LONDON. Feb. 6. â Mr. and Mrs.
Booth Tarkington, who have been stay
ing at the Hotel Quisisana, Capri, for
some little time, are now about., to
journey to Rome, where they will be
stationed at the Palace Hotel. At Ca
pri the American novelist and his wife
were known as the "Grand Duke and
Duchess" because they never question
ed the first prices that were asked them
for anything they wished to buy, no
matter how exorbitant and outrageous
were these first prices. The general
custom in Capri is to ask ridiculously
high prices and to come down grad
ually to a business basis. What still
further impressed the people of Capri
with the munificence of their "Grand
Duke and Duchess" was that when at
tending a native wedding Mrs. Tark
ington, suddenly realizing that she had
no present with her for the bride, un
clasped a pearl necklace from her neck
and presented it to the bride. This
thrifty lady was overwhelmed with joy
at the American's tribute, and it was
not long before she was at the local
Jeweler's at Capri having the gift
valued. To Mr. and Mrs. Tarkington's
Intense amusement it was priced by
this authority at 10,000 francs. The
bride is envied of all her friends while
the giver and a few friends are enjoy
ing a joke, for, having left her jewelry
In America, Mrs. Tarkington bought a
few imitation things in England to
wear until she' got back. The price she
paid for the pearl necklace in London
was just ?5.
It was via Paris that Booth Tarking
ton went to Capri, and one day, when
strolling through the Paris streets the
novelist was accosted by an old beggar
â who asked for alms. Mr. Tarkington
looked at the man for a moment, then
dropped a louls into his hands. The
beggar was thunderstruck at the re
ceipt of so much money and, while the
donor looked on amused, kept passing
it from one hand- to another to make
sure it was real. Then Tarkington in
execrable French tried to explain, and
finally taking hold of the bewildered
old man. dragged him off to a neighbor
ing florist's, where he decorated him
with choice orchids. All this time the
beggar had been absolutely speech-

less, but finding himself garlanded
with costly flowers, he became affright
ed, gazing alternately at Tarkington,
the glittering gold in his hand and at
his floral decorations, and clutching
the florist by the arm he whispered,
"Tell me. Is he crazy or am I?"
Jean Gerardy, the famous 'cellist, is
the latest notable addition to Edna
May's long list of fervent admirers. I
hear that the impressionable young mu
sician has given to the fair American
actress a rare old violoncello of beau
tiful quality and tone, which cost him
$2000. and has also paid for six months'
'cello lessons for her, being fondly
convinced that she has other and great
er musical gifts than her voice. Jewels
from an Indian Prince and some valu
able ermines from another titled per
sonage were among her other Christ
mas gifts from this lucky Syracuse
girl's circle.
My Brussels correspondent writes
that the Prince of Looz Corservarcin
has Just been arrested in Brussels for
swindling operations In Paris. Re
tired tradespeople and upper servants
with good savings were his principal
victims, he having succeeded in wring
ing from them about $150,000, as nearly
as the police can estimate. The Prince's
title and his luxurious style of living,
as well as the promise of generous old
age pensions from a fortune of the
Humbert kind, were the bait that lured
the victims to ruin. In 1890, when still
in the divorce court, his Highness made
the acquaintance of a Mrs. Bloomfield,
a rich American widow, whose fortune
he coveted, and he became engaged to
her. Her American shrewdness, how
ever, enabled her to discover the state
of affairs and she declined "a crown
with the paint worn off" and a dam
aged reputation.
At Ghent the Prince picked up at one
of the clubs a young American, the son
of a retired Chicago merchant who haft
died Jn Paris in 1S88, leaving his better
half a handsome fortune. The Prince
made the acquaintance of the lady
through her son and laid siege to her
hand and money bags; but she, too,
escaped him. He then went to Nice,
where he pretended he was' about to
-marry -the -widow ot Prince ; Trqubetâ
skoi-Demidoff. To keep Tils creditors
quiet he had to invent various pre
texts to account for the postponement
of the wedding. His matrimonial ad
ventures are for the time cut short,
as he is now sÂ»fely under lock and
key in St. Giles prison, Brussels.
The United States Minister to Bel
gium and Mrs. Lawrence Townsend
were among the special guests invited
by Sir Constantine Phipps, the Eng
lish Minister to Belgium, to the fare
well dinner given to the Papal Nuncio,
Monslgnor Granlto del Belmonte. At
this Brussels dinner the various Min
isters of different countries were all
present with their wives. Madame Go
mez Brandao was also present with her
sister, Mrs. Barton, and considerable
Interest centered around the former
lady, as Sir Constantine Phipps seized
the occasion to present her as his
fiancee. She Is the widow of a resident
of Rio Janeiro, where Sir Constantine
was formerly British Minister, and Is
doubtless well known to Americans
who have stayed there. She is young
and very charming, with lovely fair
hair. She has one little boy.
AMERICANS IX EUROPE.
Mr. and Mrs. W. E. Stone of Cam
bridge, Mass., spent a few weeks at
Wiltcher's Hotel, Brussels, whither
they went from Paris expressly to
visit Councilor Ehrlich of Chicago, Mrs.
Ehrlich and their son Carl, who is
studying at Cambridge. Mrs. Stone,
who has been some little time in Eu
rope for the education of her younger
daughters, Margot and Amy, is 1 looking
very well, and the two young girls,
who have just turned their hair up,
have won all hearts with their frank
American manners and charming danc
ing.

Jack Gage Stark of Kansas City is
in Paris living In the Latin quarter
in the midst of American . and French
artists. Mr. Stark Is now engaged in
making a series of drawings of the old
castles of France, treating them in an
excellent and decorative manner. He
has also marked literary ambitions,
and for the purpose of collecting ma
terial for a group of "Cow Puncher"
stories which he Is now about to write,
he worked as a cowboy last summer
both in Old and New Mexico, at the
same time making color sketches which

his acquaintance with Mr. and Mrs.

MIES SARAH TRUAX. THE ACTRESS, IS MYSTIFIED AT THE APATHY SHOWN IN SAN FRANCISCO TO
WARD "THE ETERNAL CITY." THE DRAMA THAT HAS BEEN SO TREMENDOUSLY SUCCESSFUL IN
THE PRINCIPAL CITIES OF THE EAST.
If the artist and I had arrived there
at the same time, as per prior arrange
ment. Miss Sarah Truax would have
been deprived of one hearty laugh and
wÂ« would have missed the enjoyment
of hearing It. But the artist's punc

tapped the door the laugh had been
provoked and was in full blast.
Still, I did not regret my dilatoriness.
It would have been cruelty to withhold
fn.m the leading woman of "The Eter

laugh. Hers* is not the gurgling giggle
of green girlhood, nor the teetering tit

the unctuous, silent Jellying of the

"It was something your friend
said," she explained, nodding toward
the #rtist, who sat in a corner and du
plicated my grin.
"Very funny? I inquired, taking
brother corner. ''â¢''.,:'â 
"Well. I think so." she replied. "We
were chatting along nicely when he
suddenly asked if I was much troubled
byâ oh, dear! Ha! ha! ha!"
"Fleas?" I ventured, and the artist
glared reproach.
" "Noâ reporters!" she shouted, and
again the welkin rang. "I thought he
was zoiag to Bay fleas (the artist look
â¢1 pain%d) because several persons
we ask*d me if fleas bothered me.

' riers' is what tickles â "
â¢Almost as much as fleas?" put in
the artist, and Yin looked relieved when
the lady laughed again.
"I have never seen a preventive of
interviewing advertised," ehe resumed,
"and if there were such a specific on
the market I'm eure it would find few
purchasers among theater folk. Being
interviewed is the least of my affilc
.tions. at any rate, and it may please
you gentlemen to be assured that this
visit is not an intrusion. But what do
you want me to talk about â shop?"
"Tell us how you are enjoying San
Francisco," I suggested.
"I am enjoying every minute of it-
San Francisco is particularly dear to
roe because I became a bride here.
Maybe you remember the wedding that
Easter Sunday morning seven years
Afo? Ko? Well, there was enough of
the event printed and pictured to make
it memorable to more than the two
persons chiefly concerned."
"Who was the other person?"
"Guy Bates Post. We were members
of the Otis Skinner company, then
playing at the Baldwin Theater. Our
betrothal was kept very quiet, and
until we arrived at the churchâ St.
John's Episcopal â we thought that only
a few of our confederates would be
there to see us united. But instead
we found the edific* fairly packed
with people, and subsequently we dis
covered that the morning papers had
unearthed and exposed the conspiracy.
So there we were with no less distin
guished a musician than Clarence
Eddy presiding at the organ and Mrs.
Saunders, the veteran actfess, mother
ing me. and Otis Skinner giving me
away to Mr. Post, and Mr. Eddy play
ing the 'Lohengrin*, wedding march,
and the throng of women fairly crush-
Ing my husband and me with floral of
ferings and congratulations. If the
scene Had been enacted yesterday it
couli not be mOJ-e plainly in my vision.
Why shouldn't San Francisco be dear
"My husband, too, has only the kind
liest recollections of San Francisco. We
have often talked of our wedding day
and the many new friends it brought
us. This is my first return to the dear
old city, and Mr. Post never came back.
He is acting in New York and can re
main there as long as he lives, so well
do the Gothamites like him." : .
"And what have you been doing since
you went away a bonnie bride?"
"All kinds of dramatic work. I had
spent three years with the Skinner
company playing such roles as Pauline
and Portia when my husband and other
well-wishers advised me to enter a field
that would afford a more diversified
range of characterization. 'You have
mastered the technique,' they said, 'and
you have proved capability to carry ro-*
mantle parts. Now you must branch
out and get experience In more natural
roles.' So I went Into stock and stuck
to it, mostly in Plttsburg, until I had
played almost every character, from a
latter-day boy to Juliet. I have been a
singing soubrette, and my old women
won compliments from the critics.
After the gamut had been run, so to
speak, I rested for a year in New York;
visiting my husband and attending lec
tures, concerts, operas, plays and social
parties. That was a well-spent twelve
month. It strengthened me physically
and broadened me. Intellectually. For
nine years my time had been divided
between hotels aiyJ theaters and my as
sociates were, stage folk, 80 it did -me

incalculable good In an educational way
to mingle with the public and be a part
of it, sharing its emotions and studying
its tastes at close range." <â¢
"Yet you returned to the stage."
"Oh, I don't dislike the stage. It is
the center of all my hopes and ambi
tions, and I couldn't live in any other
occupation despite the fact that neces
sity first drove me to it. I was in train
ing for a musical career â learning piano
and voice â when my father became an
invalid, and the duty of contributing to
the family's support devolved .upon me.
Mother had always believed I was bet
ter qualified for dramatic than musical
expression, and when the bread-and
butter question confronted us It was she
who persuaded Mr. Skinner to enlist
me in his company. I have never re
gretted that hour. Stage work is weari
some at times, especially on a tour like
this one of 'The Eternal City,' and if
one were to think of nothing but its
shadow's and ignore Its lights the life
would be unendurable."
"What are your, compensatory
phases?" '
"One of them is constant realization
of what a big art is that of acting.
Another is the thought that I am
steadily getting nearer 'to the goal of
my ambition. In trying moments I find
solace, in the reflection that through
tortured patience and arduous work I
am approaching consummation of my
life desire." j Â«
"And that is?"
I "To be a first-class artist; to be an
actress whose acting is absolutely
natural and convincing. You have
seen Mrs. Fiske and Duse? They are
great artists. Friends who would not
be so cruel as to buoy me up w'ith
false hope have said that my aspira
tion is more than possible of attain
ment; that I possess the requisite
physical, intellectual and tempera
mental, qualifications. With such an
equipment, then, wouldn't I be un
true to myself and to all I hold dear
on earth if I' did not strive to develop
the best that is in me? It is remem
brance of the faith of tried and true
friends that sustains me through
trials that most women would bend
under." My husband is my severest
critic and most considerate adviser.
Much of whatever* art I possess is ow
ing to # his watchful interest in my ad
vancement. I- followed his sugges
tions while we were together, and
while away from him I fashion my
work-as I think he would desire."
"Does your role in "The Eternal City*
bring you nearer co the goal?" ;..
"I'm glad you thought 1 of asking
that The Eternal City" is a magnif-
Icent melodrama and the character I
portray, Roma, is perforce placed in
some rather strained situations. My
effort is to make Roma appear nat
ural always, and when you remember
some' of those situations you will
acknowledge that my* task Is not an
easy one. How well I succeed in
maintaining her* consistency only
those who witness the performance
can judge. We actors cannot see our
selves as others see us, you know,"
"You succeed so well that Roma
stands out a true figure in an artificial
environment, like a genuine brilHant
in "a papier mache setting." . \
"She does not appear incongruous,
I hope?"
"No; she merely accentuates the in
congruity of the sham setting."
"Thank you,'/ said Miss Truax.
"Now can you explain why San Fran
cisco takes less kindly to 'The Eternal
City* than has any other big city we
have played in?"
I thought "The Eternal City" had
made the proverbial "financial and
artistic^ hit" in San Francisco "and I
told her so.
j "If you think that," said M^s Tru
ax, "you ought to have seen the great
business and enthusiasm that reward
ed us in New York and Chicago."
"Perhaps," I deploringly conjec
tured, "the play is too heavy a' draft
on our intellectual resources."
"Nothing of the sort," was the
prompt and emphatic contradiction.
"I know that* San Francisco's intellec
tuality will compare favorably with
that of any city in the United
States â " .
1 "Including Boston?"
"Excluding nothing; and I know also
that 'The Eternal City' is not too pro
found s "of motive nor too complex of
plot for any ordinary intellect to com
prehend. As for the acting, I need
only state that Mr. Bangs and I ar^
the only members of the present com
pany who were not in the original cast.
The play, as I have said, is a magnifi
cent melodrama with a superb musical
accompaniment by one of the greatest
modern composers. Why, then, should
it find San Francisco comparatively un
appreciative?" ,
I thought of several possible reasons
befpre I advanced any. The location
of the California Theater might have
something to do with it, or th'e quality
of the average offering at that play
house might be partly responsible.
"We succeeded 'The Fatal Wedding'
at the California, and I understand we
are to be succeeded by Murray and
Mack," said Miss Truax, musingly;
"but even being sandwiched like that
does not fully clear up the mystery."
Then the artist chipped in. He re
marked that several years ago E. J.
Morgan, now featured on the posters
and in the newspapers as "the main
squeeze" of the Hall Caine play, had
strutted with Tim Frawley to popular
prices in a theater soutir of Market
street â and mightn't that fact wholly
or In part sorve -the -problem? If the
query was heard by the lady she ap
parently did not deem it entitled to
consideration, for she quickly said:
"It does seem queer that the syndi
cate â the shrewd, far-seeing syndicate
â should have placed 'The Eternal City'
in the California and filled in time at
the Columbia with a musical comedy.
In other cities the attractions that ap
peal to culture and dignity are always
booked for the theater that professes to
cater to culture and dignity."
Then we drifted into discussion of
stars that have stayed and stars that
have waned. The extinguishment of. so
many new stellar lights this season
was charitably criticized by Miss
Truax.
"It has been an unprecedentedly dis
astrous season for ail sorts of amuse
ment enterprises," she said, "and the
fact that several new stars, have briefly
flickered and then expired is not accept
able as proof of their inability to blaze
under ordinary conditions. I , believe
that the basic cause of the slump in
theatricals lies somewhere in Wall
street, but I am not enough of a finan
cier to detect Its exact location. The
Chicago holocaust did not tend to
avert the collapse, and overproduction
ot worthless attractions certainly
helped it."
"Have you ever tried starring?" I
asked.
"Oh, dear, yes. For two consecutive
weeks I played the title part of 'Lady
Godiva' in New York, and the the
ater was packed at every perform
ance. Previously made contracts that
could Rot be canceled then compelled
thi* house management to oust us,
and we found that the play was too
big a thing to bring profits on the
road. It was a great spectacular pro
duction, with many' historical char
acters."
'~yas Peeping Tc .: r.rr.ong them?"
"He vczb merely suggested."
"And the lady's ride through ..Co
ventry town?"
" MIps Truax hesitated. The artist
perked up and evinced professional in
terest.
"I saw a picture once.," he began,
"and the lady's hair was her only
cov â "
"Much of the actucl story was sug
gested," Miss Truax hastily exclaim
ed; "but the entire production was
beautiful."
"It ought to. go well nowadays, while
the popular taste is running to theâ
the spectacular," I stammered.
,"Oh, I don't know about that>* said
Miss Truax, apparently eager to get
away from Coventry. "Nobody can
tell what the public does want. So
far as I can Judge from careful investi
tion comic opera and musical comedy
lavishly produced have .had their
vogue, the problem play is played. out,
exaggerated, melodrama is losing its
grip and vaudeville is wilting."
"Then nothing is doing well?"
"Nothing is doing so well as clean
ccmedy and 'atmosphere* drama. They
have scored the only enduring successes
in New York this' season, and if . I, were
a play writer they are the only, things
I would attempt. . Kyrle Bellew is
drawing big money In 'Raffles,' the
comedy \' written by Richard Harding
Davis. Success has crowned George
Ade's play, 'The : County Chairman.'
because it . is full of homely 'atmos
phere.' and the same, may \ be said of
â¢The Virginian,' the dramatization of
Owen Wister's ; sketches of . the Wyom
ing cattle country. My husband is in
the cast, of !The Virginian* and I am
interested enough in the play to have
found nut. .that its charm lies in Ha
characterization. They are all cow
cemp characters, not drawn as the
dime novelist who has never been west
of the Alleghanies draws them, but as
men and women whose actions are
prompted by pretty much the same hu
man, impulses that regulate more gen
teel* society. "They do not shoot re
volvers indiscriminately nor | whoop
without provocation,' but deplore un
necessary bloodshed and converse
quietly.,. In the whole drama there is
not one intense situation. It is the
prairie 'atmosphere', that crowds the
theater 'with the best class of New
York's people."
"Then you will probably revisit us
as the heroine of an atmospheric
drama?"
"My immediate future is not decided.
I will remain with 'The Eternal City*
until it â  restores me to the Atlantic
Coast, and then I may either sign for
a second season or try something elfee.
I have not relinaulshed hope of reviv
ing 'Lady Godiva.' The play was writ
ten for me by a New York critic and
we are corresponding as to the feasibil
ity of diminishing its cost of production
without Impairing its dramatic worth.
So it is not beyond the range of pos
sibility that I may come back to San
Francisco as a.star."
The" artist looked gratified.
"Here's hoping that you will come
back soon," I said to Miss Truax.
"Here's hoping with you," said Mis3
Truax to me.

'â  W. J. Henderson, the well known

says: "At each disclosure the opera

song, I, too, should cry, 'Ave Impera
tor' and bow the knee; for no man
worships more devoutly at the shrine

to me that there is something defec

was written by the composer of 'Tann

believe it because of the utter lack

of his performance without stooping

whether the actress' husband, provid

The chaperon of to-day, bless her,
is the legitimate and logical product
of the fine, broad system of feminine
education that prevails in Americaâ an
education wherein confidence, self-re
sponsibility and a knowledge of hu
man nature figure broadly. And as for
her who is beseeched daily to chap
eron young girls abroad you may
bank upon it that she Is a woman of
large conceptions and of a fine eym
pathy, and within her lies a love of
youth, with its earnest friendships, its
love feasts. Its misunderstandings, its
reconciliations and its wholly delight
ful denouement at the prie dieuâ these
encompass the chaperon's duties and
prerogatives.
That the up-to-date and popular
chaperon ably abets the little god in
his conquest of hearts is evident every
where about us, and this is the very
consummation of her usefulness, like
wise her art. Unlike the suspicious
duenna of the "Idle Forties," who with
a vigilance worthy of a better cause
kept the young lovers apart, or tried
to, the chaperon brings them together,
and usually sees that a little cozy cor
ner with Just room for two is of easy
access. Then she dutifully assumes a
consuming interest in contiguous things
and people, and ttie young folks work
out their own little problem. It Is Just
this adroitness at supervision that
makes the clever chaperon Indispens
able, and this is her only real function
In America. Here girls are reared and
educated to .self-respect, and resent
"watching" in the old sense and in the
manner that obtains in Mexico and
on the Continent. American girlsâ free
and independent from the very air they
breathe â cannot long endure the ap
palling custom in Mexico of being
"chaperoned" every moment of their
waking hours. But to defy the long
cherished custom In these countries
would Invite social ostracism â and
many tears.
The gods be thanked that the Ameri
can girl â the average well bred Ameri
can girlâ is quite capable to-day of dic
tating her own attitude toward the
men of her acquaintance, with a kindly
"tip" now and then from her clever
chaperon, who may and often is her
clever mamma.

DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS
TOKIO, Feb. 7.â -It is clear that diplomatic relations between Japan and Russia have been broken. Baron de Rosen, the Russian Minister, is expected
to depart in a few days. His preparations for departure are now progressing, The Russian Legation expected its Government to break silence to-day,
but no communication was received, except one announcing that trooops had been dispatched to Seoul. The populace is not aware of the diplomatic
proceedings, and, although it is generally known that the country is on the eve of war, the people await the, clash with the same calmness that marked their

to take immediate and effective steps
for the adequate protection of Ameri
can lives and property in the Domini
can republic, limiting his action at all
times to the recognized tenets of Inter
national law.
THREE WARSHIPS ARE SENT.
Upon the receipt of this dispatch Rear
Admiral Wise is expected to proceed at
once on his flagship, the Minneapolis,
to Dominican waters and make a per

ready has been ordered to return to
Santo Domingo from Guantanamo,
whither ehe went for coal, and the
Eartfcrd will be ordered back from the

The Ean Ieidro plantation is owned by
the Bertram brothers of New York. It
Is managed by an American named
Bass. The plantation Is situated on the
Ossa River, about eleven miles inland.
Only steam tugs can navigate the river,

plantation.

The scene of the Russo-Japanese

and is eagerly awaiting the first
intimation which may give a clew
to the temper of Japan. This
means official, intelligent Russia

a lesser extent, in, the larger cities.

In the hotels and restaurants of
St. Petersburg the situation is be
ing discussed to-night with great
seriousness. The weather is bit
terly cold and street fires are burn
ing tmd the people are asking if it
is possible for hostilities to begin
at a season when the thermometer
registers 40 degrees below zero in
Northern Manchuria. They are
speculating upon the horrors that
would characterize such a winter
campaign and wondering, if the
story of the sufferings at Shipka
Pass is to be repeated. The Rus
sians are confident, 'however, that
if the worst comes their hardy sol
diery can. stand the severe cold
better than can their adversaries.

LAWSUIT
Victoria Decision Is
Against Mrs. Ed
na Hopper. ;
British Columbia Justice
Sustains the Will ol
Dunsmuir.
Claim Made by a Stepdaughter of tha
Millionaire Not Recognized in
aXelebrated Case.
VICTORIA. B. C.. Feb. 6. â The de
cision in the action brought by Edna
Wallace Hopper against James Duns
muir to have set aside the will of the
late Alexander Dunsmuir and also
to set aside a deed by the terms Â«f
which Josephine Dunsmuir, In con
sideration of an annual payment of
$25,000, relinquished for herself and
her heirs all claim to Dunsmulr*s es
tate, was this morning announced
against the plaintiff and the Inter
venor, the mother of the defendant
and testator.
Justice Drake, who rendered the
decision, held that the plaintiff had no
right, either legal or equitable, to at
tack the will, the tables of consan
guinity not recognizing a stepdaugh
ter.
The ground of the action was undue
influence, both as regards the will and
the deed. The matter of the will is
disposed of in the judgment by the
citation that the tables of consan
guinity do not recognize a stepdaugh
ter. In regard to the deed, the Judg
ment holds that, admitting for the
sake of argument, It was obtained
by undue influence, it was then a void
able transaction and good until dis
affirmed. Mrs. Josephine Dunsmuir
did not disaffirm it during her life
time and the plaintiff cannot do so
now.
The judgment complains of the pre
posterous time, forty-two days, which
the case occupied in the trial and the
large amount of Irrelevant testimony.
The Judge, In his decision, expresses
his contempt for so-called medical ex
perts and says they are never impartial
and always try to Impose their views
upon the court. "Expert" testimony,
he asserts, is of little value.
Tha judgment concludes that the
facts alone show that Alexander Duns
muir was of sound and disposing mind
when he executed his will; that he hal
for a long time previously expressed
his Intention of making his will in favor
of his brother James Dunsmuir. and did
so make it. The Judge agrees with
Chancellor Sprague that facts sworn to
are of greater weight than scientific
opinion. When he finds facts which prove
business capacity, shrewdness and a
successful management of a large busi
ness concern without delusions, he is
of opinion that such a person is capa
ble of making a will.

SB. ___LMZB'S SWAMP-ROOT.
Attacked by Diseases Due to Cold, Exposure and the Terrible Strain of Their Work, Motormen
and Conductors Are Made: Strong by This Wonderful Remedy.
The daily work of a motorman is enough to break-down a constitution of steel. He must face cold and storm day and night
Cooped up on his narrow platform, he must stand, while bitter winds pierce him to the bone, no matter how heavy his clothing. Every
minute he must be on the alert, and in the midst of suffering his judgment must be quick and sure, for an error may cost q, human life.
Tired and hungry after hours of work that keep his nerves tense as fiddle-springs, he sits in the corner of a car to devour a cold, hasty
meal from a tin pail. These brave men are exposed to risks as great as those of the battlefield. Fortunately, when nature can stand the
strain no longer, the railroad men know where to find new strength and energy. The statements printed below tell of wonderful cures by

Why Swamp=Root Gives Strength. f
Almost every one, from personal experience, knows that the effects of any kind of severe physical strain are felt, first of all, in the
small of the backâ in other words, in those Vital Organs, the Kidneys. This is as true in the case of the very powerful man as it is with one
or less strength, and U is especially true whenever the kidneys are weak. Weak and unhealthy kidneys are -responsible for more sickness
and suffering than any other disease, therefore, when through neglect or other causes, kidney trouble is permitted to continue fatal results
are sure to follow. .
SWAMP-ROOT STRENGTHENS THE KIDNEYS and through them helps all the other organs. When this wonderful medical discovery
can put the human body into condition to stand the hard work and the tremendous strain of the motormen, it is easy to understand Tiow
it has cured thousands upon thousands in the more ordinary and less strenuous walks of life.
No matter how many doctors you have triedâ no matter how much money you have spent on other medicines âyou really owe it to
yourself and to your fami y to at least give Swamp Root a trial. Its strongest friends to-day are those who had almost given up hope of
ever becoming well again.
To Prove What Swamp-Root Will Do for YOU, a Sample Bottle Will Be Sent Free by Mail.
EDITORIAL NOTICEâ Swamp-Root is the new discovery of the eminent kidney and bladder specialist, and is used in the leading hospitals, recommended
by physicians in their private practice, and taken by doctors themselves, because they recognize in it the greatest and most successful remedy that has ever been
discovered.
So successful is Swamp-Root in promptly curing even the most distressing cases, that to prove its wonderful merits you may have a sample bottle and a book

ENDURANCE RUN
IS SUGGESTED
Automobilists Are Planning
the Most Ambitious Event of
This Kind Ever Attempted
NEW* YORK, Feb. 6.â Plans are be
ing made for the largest and longest
endurance run of automobiles ever held
in this 1 country. â  In connectipn with
the endurance run itself it is also hoped
to hold a series of club runs, all to have
the St. Louis Exposition for their goal.
If proper arrangements can be made
the racetrack at St. Louis may be se
cured for a week or more at the close
of the run. and besides being used as a
garage, races and exhibition runs will
be held. - . - 3@3Â£*_I3_t__!
Those who have been discussing the
subject are _, inclined to believe that
some time in June, probably from the
middle to the end of the month, would
be the most acceptable time for the
run. It is proposed that the May event,
the endurance run, shall start from this
city, and from one week to ten days
probably will be given to reach St.
Louis.

Against Two Young Men

ing the arrest of Freeman James, the
well-kndwn young society youth, upon
the charge of highway robbery yes
terday, came the arrest of his younger
brother, Norman James, on a similar
charge to-day.
The two arrests are creating a sen
sation, as the boys are sons of promi
nent people here and have been well
known figures at all affairs of the
younger social element of the past
few years. Freeman James is 17 years
of age and tall and handsome. His
brother is also large for his age.
When Freeman was arrested last
night pressure was brought to bear
upon the Police Department to release
the young man and avoid publicity, as
it was claimed a complete alibi could
be established. But the police were
obdurate. Then came Samuel Glid
den, former president of the National
Bank, in which the father of the boys
is a clerk. Glidden also pleaded, but
did not succeed.
The publication of the arrest created
a sensation this morning. An alibi
was set up for the older James boy,
but the police say he has been posi
tively identified by one of the alleged
victims, and another victim declares
the younger brother robbed him upon
the outskirts of the city.

SILVER DOLLAR OF 1801
BRINGS LARGE PRICE
Ninety-Nine- Year-Old Coin Goes at
| $2000 to Portland, Or., to Join
f Six Companions.
i A United States dollar, now in its
ninety-ninth year, yesterday began tho
long trip from Denver to Portland, Or.,
after having lain in a Denver collection
i of coins for more than eighteen years.
j Though the dollar is about the size of
those coined during the present year,
and contains about the same number
of grains of silver, it brought in tha
neighborhood of about $5 33 per grain
of pure silver in its combination, and
all this because it has been in the one
form for nearly one hundred years.
The dollar is one of the coinage of
1804, of which there are only seven
known to be in existence. it wa3
boughj by the late J. V. Dexter at the
Chapman sale of coins in 1S35. At th:tt
Vme the coin had been but lately se
cured from a collection in Berlin, being
I the only one of . the dollars that is
j known to have been in a foreign col
' lection. Mr. Dexter paid $1000 for the
dollar, having, to bid against several
other collectors, the price being at that
j time the largest that had ever been
paid for one of the coinage named.
Since then one of the other coins had
been sold for $1200, a record that hf>ia
; good until yesterday, when H. O.
Brown of Portland, Or., paid $2000 for
the coin to R. G. Parvin. who suc
ceeded to the ownership of the Dexter
collection. Mr. Parvin did not willingly
part with the coin at that price, for he
has held It as the key piece of his nu
mismatic collection.
About a year ago the Republican
printed the stcry of the Parvin 1804
dollar, and it was copied extensively
throughout the country. As a result
Mr. Parvin has been receiving letters
ever since concerning his collection of
rare coins from all parts of the coun
try. A Chicago man tried to buy the
dollar, offering up to $1500, and failed.
Then a man in St. Louis tried to se
cure it for a collection to be exhibited
at the World's Fair. During these ne
gotiations Mr. Parvin thought that he
had discovered the limit of bidding,
and that no man would go over $1500
in trying to get the coin. So when he
was asked by Mr. Brown to put a price
i upon it he replied that he was not will
ing to dispose of it, but had set his
price at $2000. Mr. Brown did not wait
: for the slow progress of the United
States mail, but telegraphed to send on
the old dollar. Since then telegrams
have been coming at the rate of one a
day. Yesterday, while Mr. Parvin was
reluctantly placing the dollar in a
candy box and labeling It, there came
another telegram to hurry up the.dol
, lar anyway, and to send it C. O. J). if
! there was no other way. So the dollar
started west.
The scarcity of dollars of the 1S04
mintage Is explained by an accident at
' sea. The larger part of the silver dol
lars of that year were struck off to pay
United States soldiers and sailors doing
duty in Tripoli, North Africa, and were
shipped to that place. The vessel that
carried them away from this country
was never heard from again, so the ea
. tiro cargo is supposed to rest some
where upon the floor of the Atlantic
Just seven copies of the doliars
of that year are in existence, two lying
in the Mint at Philadelphia ard the
others being private collections. In
1S5& some copies of the coin of 1S04 were
struck off, beingsknown as "restrikes,"
but all but two of them were called in,
the records show, and destroyed. One
copy of the "restrike" is in the Mint at
Philadelphia and the other is. owned in
â¢ England; No counterfeit of the 1804
dollar was ever known. â Denver Re

WASHINGTON, Feb. 6.â The official
announcement of Senator Hanna's con

It was stated that the Senator had
suffered less pain to-day and had taken
one or two ounces more of milk and
seemed a little stronger.
No comment was made by the doctor
on the* higher pulse to-night than yes

beats over the same time last night,
while the temperature is practically the
same as last night. The temperature
is regarded as the mc/re important indi

runs in cycles of seven days. The crisis
is marked by the highest temperature.

He regards the crisis as still in the

Get My Book if Sick
Don't Send a Penny
Don't ser.d a penny.
JuÂ«t wait till you see what I can do.
Let me take the r!^c Let me prove up first what Dr. Shoop's
Restorative can do. Restorative will gain your friendship, your
endorsement if you Vest it. And for a whole month you can test it
without the slightest risk.
I will tell you of a druc&ist near you who will furnish six bot-
tles of
Dr. Shoop's Restorative
A Moatfa 00 Trial
I will BtÂ»cd absolutely all the cost If It falls. If you say, "It did
not help* me;" that ends It as far as cost to you Is concerned. Do
you understand rae? I am telling It as plainly, as clearly as I can.
I war.t you to know absolutely and without doubt this offer Is made
on honor. I have the prescription that cures. My only problem Is
to convince you that Dr. Shoop's Restorative will cure â Is an un-
common remedy. A common remedy could not stand a test like this.
It would bankrupt the physician making the offer. And I am suc-
ceeding everywhere, and here is the secret of my success. I found
invariably that where there was a weakness, the inside nerves were
weak. \Vfcen there was a lack of vitality, the vital nerves lacked
power. Where weak organs were found. I always found weak
nerves. Not the nerves commonly thought of, but the vital organ's
nerve*. The Inside â the Invisible nerves.
This waa a revelation. Then my real success begun. Then I com-
bined Ingredients that would strengthen, that would vitalize, these
r.erres. That prescription I called a restorative. It Is known the
world over now as Dr. Shoop's Restorative.
Thousands are accepting my offer and only one ln each forty writes
me that my remedy failed. Just think of It. 39 out of 40 get well.
and these ere dlfflcult cases, too. And the fortieth has nothing to
pay. That Is a record I am proud of. It Is wrong to stay sick
when a chance like this Is open. If well, you should tell others who
are sick, of my offer. Don't let a sick friend stay sick because he
knows not of my offer. Tell him. Get my bÂ»ok for him. Do your
duty. You may be sick yourself sometime. Sick people need help.
They appreciate eympathy and aid. Tell me of some sick friend.
Let me cure him, Then he will show to both of us his gratitude.
Tout reward wUl be his gratitude. Send for the book now. Do not

Actors frequently received unexpect
ed proof of the realism of their art.
This story, which Is reported from a
Chicago theater, is like the Btory of
th<Â» artist who painted a fire so vivid
ly that his servant threw water on it.
"Hamlet" was the play. In the gal
lery two small newsboys were watch
lrjs with breathless interest. The last
act was drawing to a close. The duel
almost dragged the boys from their
chairs.
Before their eyes the Queen was
r>oisone<3. Laertes killed, the King
killed, Hamlet killed. On the final
tragedy the -curtain started down. The
audience was spellbound.
. In the gallery sounded a clatter and
crash as one of the boys bolted for the
door.
"Come on. Jlrnrayl~ he shouted back
to his "pal." "Hustle up! Dey*U be
extras out on dls."
To him the acting had been at least
as real as news. â Youth's Companion.

DAKOTA GIVEN
HER FIRST DIP
Screams From Whistles and
Cheers From Thousands Greet
Launching of New Vessel
CHRISTENED WITH WINE
Governor Chamberlain and
Many Other Notable Citizens
Are Present at the Ceremony
GROTON, Conn., Feb. 6.â The steam
ship Dakota, for the Great Northern
Steamship Company, was successfully
launched to-day from the yards of the
Eastern Shipbuilding Company amid a
din of salutes from whistles of vessels,
factories and locomotives and cheers
of fully E000 spectators. Miss Mary
Fleming of Ellendale, N. D., was spon
sor, and as the great craft began to
slip away from the christening stand
she broke a bottle of champagne on the
prow, saying, "I christen thee $>akota."
In the christening stand were Gov
ernor Abram Chamberlain, President J.
J. Hill of the Great Northern Steamship
Company and 'members of the Boards
of Trade of Minneapolis and St. Louis,
with ladles. The christening was with
wine, contrary to the desire of many
women of the Dakotas that water be
used.
The Dakota, like her sister ship the
Minnesota, which was launched at the
Eastern Shipbuilding Company's yards
ln April, 1903, is of the largest type of
cargo and passenger vessels built ln the
United States. The dimensions are:
Length 630 feet over all, 73 feet 4 Inches
breadth. 56 feet molded depth, Sa. feet
draught and gross tonnage 22,000 tons.
Triple expansion engines of 11,000 horse
power driving twin screws are expected
to develop an average speed of fourteen
knots an hour.
The contracts for the Dakota and the
Minnesota were awarded early in 1900
to the Eastern Shipbuilding Company,
the contract price for each vessel being
$2,500,000. In June of that year work
was commenced on permanent ways.
The keels were laid in September. The
vessels were designed by "William A.
Fairburn, the marine architeot of the
shipbuilding company, embracing the
ideas of James J. Hill, president of the
Great Northern Railway Company. It
is estimated that the Minnesota will
be ready for her sea trial trip next
July and the Dakota in September.

JURY'S VERDICT
FREES BUTLER
Finds the Millionaire St. Louis
Politician Not Guilty of
the Bribing: of Officials
FEIENDS ARE OVERJOYED
Acquitted Man Sheds Tears
When Receiving the Con
gratulations of His Son
FULTON, Mo.. Feb. 6. â The Jury in
the case of Colonel Ed Butler, the mil
lionaire St. Louis politician, on trial
here on a charge of bribing nineteen
members of the House of Delegates
of St. Louis, to-day returned a verdict
of not guilty.-
When the verdict was rendered a
dozen of Colonel Butler's friends gave
a wild shout and dashed out into the
street to spread the news. Butler
stepped Quickly forward and shook
hands with Foreman Rosser. Then
he walked down the line of Jurors,
ehaking hands with each.
When he had finished shaking hands
with the Jury Colonel Butler turned,
to his son, Eddie, the big blacksmith.
There were tears ln the old man's eyes
and the young man, unable to speak,
grabbed his father and kissed him. â¢
Circuit Attorney Folk, who waa ln
the courtroom, appeared dumfounded.
"I thought the State had a good
case." he said. "Beyond that I have
nothing to say at this time."
About eighteen ballots ware taken,
according to Foreman Rosser, and at
the start the Jury stood ten for acquit
tal and two for conviction.
"One of thoaa voting to convict
changed after the first ballot," said
Rosser. "The other man held out
stubbornly until 9:45 o'clock this
morning, when he finally came Into
line. The Jurors did not want to con
vict the defendant on the testimony of
boodlers and perjurers,' whose state
ments were flatly contradicted by men
of good character."

Burnt Cork of Commerce.
There is a small factory on the Bow
ery where burnt cork used by minstrel
companies and blackfaced artists of
the present day is manufactured. The
business was started In 1877 by Ed
Mills, an .old minstrel. When he died
his widow took charge. About seven
years ago she retired, selling out to a
German who used to be a â  watchman
in one of the Bowery variety theaters.
The business is still run 'in her name.
"The decline of minstrelsy," said the
factory proprietor to the Sun reporter,
"has injured this industry a great deal,
but I am still able to make fair profits.
There is only, one other' firm, some
where out West, that manufactures the
stuff, and the competition does not do
me much harm and I am able to get
along. Of course, the business is not
what it used to be, but with the advent
of modern theaters and the introduc
tion of incandescent lights it might be
worse.
"In former years most of the min
strels used to burn old corks over. the
gas and , use them.; But the j introduc
tion of electricity has done away with
that. Minstrels now prefer the pre
pared cork, because it is handler and
cheaper. Th'e stuff sells for 50 cents a
pound, and this quantity is sufficient
to last for months. The cost of manu
facture is small and if I had enough
customers I would be able to earn plen
ty of money."â New York Sun,

CASH HOLDINGS
ARE REDUCED
New York Associated Banks'
'Statement Shows Heavy In
crease in the Week's Loans
ESTIMATES GO AWEY
Figures Based Upon Traceable
Movements of Coin Prove
to Be Far Wide of tho 3Iark
NEW YORK, Feb. 6.â The Financier
this week says: The prominent feature
of the official statement of the New
York Associated Banks last week were
Increases to new high records in loans
and in deposits and an important re
duction in cash holdings, resulting in
a decrease ln the surplus reserve.
The loan expansion of $4,298,700 was,
as has been the case in previous weeks,
due chiefly to corporation and stock
exchange loaning, though It would ap
pear that the former- -was quite mid
crate.
The increase in the loan item last
week made the expansion since Janu
ary 2 J9O.280.30O, to J998.850.S00, or within
51,149,200 of the billion dollar mark.
The increase of $3,212,700 ln deposits
makes the new high record of $1,027,
156,500, and the gain since January 2
has been $240,997,500.
The cash showed a net reduction of
$2,483,100, legal tenders falling off $2,
952,500 and specie Increasing $498,400,
whereas the estimates, which were
based upon the traceable movements of
money during the week, Indicated a
gain in cash of $2,264,200. The discrep
ancy between the estimated gain and
the loss as recorded by the bank state
ment was probably due to unreported
withdrawals from the banks and also
to the bringing over into last week the
four days' average of the $2,800,000 pay
ment In the previous week of the Cen
tral Pacific note.
The Increase of $3,S32,700 in deposits
caused an augmentation of $802,175 in
the required reserve, which sum added
to the net loss of cash made a decrease
of $3,266,275 ln the surplus reserve to
$21,842,775. Calculated upon the basis of
deposits, less those of $36,983,300 of pub
lic funds, the surplus is $31,066,100.
It is noteworthy that whereas recent
statements | have . shown a good proof,
last week's returns failed to prove by
$1,397,100.- the increase in deposits being
greater by this amount than the sum
of the gain in loans less the net loss of
cash. ; The deposits were . in excess of
loans. last week. by $28,305,700, against
$29,391,700 In the previous week.
: It Is reckoned that the household and
personal i refuse of all kinds and street

half a ton annually per head of the pop

REFUGE IX SWAMP
Mississippi Xegro and Wife Kill Of
ficers' Bloodhounds and Prepare
for Fight to Death.
VICKSBURG, Miss., Feb. 6.â Driven
to bay in a dense swamp, near Green
wood, Luther Holbert and his wife,
wanted at Doddsvllle for the murder
of James Eastland, are prepared to sell
their lives dearly. The negroes to-day
killed four of the State's bloodhounds
that had tracked them into the swamp.
Several hundred men from four coun
ties are guarding every exit from the
swamp. Unless the couple attempt to
break through the cordon to-night, the
posse plans to beat the woods thor
oughly in the morning. Holbert's wife
is dressed in male attire and both she
and her husband are heavily armed.
Two negroes were killed by a posse
near Belzonla, Yazoo county, to-day.
One of them, thought to be Holbert,
showed fight when called upon to halt
and both were shot to death.
The present scene of action Is in Ig
nore county, the chase having led
across three counties.
Value of Learning to Knit.
Fifty years ago every woman and
girl was taught to knit as part of her
education. Now, however, compara
tively few are taking to knitting
needles with any seriousness or inten
tion. Young women should become ex
pert knitters not because they cannot
buy things as cheaply .as they can
produce them, but with a view of that
far-off day which is certain to come In
timeâ the . day of. old age. To the
brightest girl there may fifty years
hence arrive the day of deafness,
when the voices of music shall be
brought low, or the day of blindness,
when the fair world shall be dim and

thousand dollars, and which contains
the keys to her safe deposit box ln a

Arriving home late, Mrs. Oelrichs had
no occasion to ascertain if everythlns;
was safe and it was not until late tha

JAPANESE SITLITARY
>li:iHca\I. SERVICE
The British Medical Journal-says the
Japanese military rsÂ«?dical arrange
ments are so extreniLSj' up to date as
to be scientifically comparable with
those of any nation, â ofiiile in point of
generosity of the provision of medical j
oncers, elasticity and a.<iaptableness to
varying conditions, the difference is,
perhaps, in favor of Japan. Thus,
while base hospitals, fieJd hospitals,
dressing stations of three f^pes, bearer
companies and hospital ships all find
their place, each division of the army
has a medical reserve, which is mobil
ized simultaneously with i^ and serves
in the ba3e ot reserve hospitals. The
medical department also has its own
independent transport, and every in
fantry regiment, cavalry, artillery, en
gineer and general transport battalion
has a medical Ftaff attached to . it
of a very complete kind. Besides all
these standing arrangements, the reg
ulations provide for an automatic ad
dition to the personnel of the hospitals
in accordance with the number of pa
tients present, without reference to>
headquarters. Moreover, so long as a
military medical officer remains In.
chief command additions may be made
"from the civilian population; every
thing, too. is done to facilitate the co
operation of the Japanese Red Crossi
Society. The Russian arrangements
ere also good upon paper, and Russian
military surgeons have an advantage;
over the majority of their European
colleagues, inas:ruieh as that they
habitually do the work of nearly all the\
civil hospitals.

jCopied Largely From Germany the
System by Which They Are

The Japanese army and navy are
creatediand sustained, as to personnel.
by a coesscription system, quite like
that of Germany. Theoretically "all
males between the* full apes of 17 and
40 years, who are Japanese subjects,
shall be liable to conscription." This ;
period is, moreover, divided up as fol- !
lows: <1> Active service with the col
ors, for three years in the army and
four years in the navy, by those who
have '"attained the full age of 20
years"; so that those who are between
17 and 20 are apparently exempt ex
'cept '"in time of war or other emer- ',
gency." (55 Rirst Reserve term ofi
â¢four years in the army and three
years in the navy, "by such as have
completed their service with the col
ors." (3) Second! Reserve term of five
years, "by those who have completed
their service in the First Reserves,"
and (4) ServJqe in the Territorial Army
for the remaining years by those who
have completed the preceding term.
But the last three services are merely
nominal, as the .First and Second Re

ordinarily called out only for drill
once a year .andi are mobilized, in or

Therefore- the actual service in bar

EMPEROR OF JAPAN
SUMMONS HIS WAR
CHIEFS TO COUNCIL
TOKIO, Feb. 6.â Field Mar
shal Marquis Oyama, chief of the
Japanese general staff; Admiral
Baron Yamamoto, Japan's Minis
ter of the Navy; General Terau
chi, Minister of- .War, and the
Minister of Finance have been re
ceived in special audience by the
Emperpr. Baron de Rosen, the
Russian Minister,, called on- the
Mikado's Foreign Minister, Baron
Komura, at 2 o'clock this after
noon and had a brief conference,
at which the Czar's- envoy had an
audience with the Emperor. -
It is understood that Russia's
reply to Japan's, latest note , w'a$
cabled by Viceroy Alexieff at Port
Arthur to Baron de. Rosen, here,
but whether the Baron has" yet
presented it to the Mikado or not
has not been positively ascer
tained. The Mikado's conference
with his Finance. Minister and
war chiefs immediately after see
ing the Russian Envoy gives rise
to the inference that the Czar's an
swer has been received and read.
JAPAN'S MIND MADE UP.
Will Pursue Her Chosen Policy Re
gardless of Russian Xote.
PARIS, Feb. 7.â Baron Hayashi. the
Japanese Minister to Great Britain, in
talking to a London correspondent of
the Figaro refused to confirm or deny
the correctness of the interview which
was published in the Mating stating
that he only authorized the official pub
lication of the following: â¢ , , ;
"Russia's reply has not been received,
and so far as I know the situation is
unchanged. But if Russia will not ac
cept the clauses which Japan considers
essential war is inevitable."
" The Figaro's correspondent .concludes
that the tenor of the Matin's interview
represents Baron Hayashi's personal
views, adding that a short conversation
with the Minister suffices to snow that
he regards the situation as very crit
ical. /
Baron Hayashi during the/interview
expressed. the opinion that the optimism
of the French press was due tq the fact
that the Far Eastern question was less
studied in Paris than In London, and he
dwelt on the essential polnjt of Japan's
note demanding the mutual recognition
by Japan and Russia of the territorial
integrity and independence of China
and Korea, which amounted to a formal
recognition of Chinese sovereignty over
Manchuria, The Minister did not seem
to believe that Russia would accept
this.
â¦The Matin's Cherbourg correspondent
announces that the .maritime prefect
there has issued a circular, reminding
officers -that the Minister "of Marine
alone can authorize foreigners , to enter

to be due to the fact that one English
t and one Japanese officer wearing
'civilian clothing were taken into the
arsenal by a French officer. There is
: reason to believe, says the correspond
ent, that a French officer attached to a
submarine boat and a British naval of
ficer have been arrested in connection
with the affair.
According to the London correspond
ent of the Matin persons best qualified
to speak ' authoritatively regarding
Japanese affairs declare that Japan's
final decision has already been taken
and that Russia's answer, whatever
maybe its. tenor, will not make, any
difference. ..War, these persons say, is
Inevitable, for Japan henceforth will do
as ' she chooses without considering
what Russia may think of her actions.
The Figaro thia morning says it has
reason to believe that .Foreign Minister
Lamsdorff's dispatch contained only
the essential points of the Russian note
to Japan, the full text of which will
follow the dispatch in a few days. It
further expresses the belief that the
note will not constitute the Russian
Government's last, word, but will leave
room for further negotiations.
WAR CHESTS NEED FILLING.
Both Itussia'aiul Japan Face Financial
. Difficulties.
PARIS, Feb. 6. â Public attention Is
riveted upon the ominous war cloud
hanging over the Far East. The
newspapers reflect the public feeling
that war is very near at hand, only the
most conservative maintaining that a
pacific solution Is possible. It is no
ticeable that those having Govern
ment relations take a discouraging
view. Official opinion has clearly
turned: toward the, pessimistic idea, al
though not yet 'ready to concede that
the last chance has gt>ne. The offi
cials,' -however, are convinced that
Russia will not yield to Japan's de
mands relative to Manchuria, so that
'if war 'depends upon that issue it will
be for Japan to make a final decision.
In the" matter" of ' actual news the
Foreign Office was unable to-day to
give, additional information, as it has
not yet been officially advised that the
'Russian reply had been sent. The
last definite official dispatch from St.
Petersburg said the reply was expected
to be signed and sent on Thursday.
Since then there has been no official
advice that the reply has actually
gone.
In the meantime the embassies and
legations are the centers of unusual
activity in connection with the Far
Eastern situation. Embassador Por
ter sees Foreign Minister Delcasse fre
quently and also keeps in touch with
the Russian and Japanese representa
tives. Other members of the United
States embassy mingle In diplomatic
circles and exchange Information with
all their colleagues. Definite .results
are promptly communicated to Wash

with Japan he made the following sig
nificant reply:
"Inlhe event of war I am convinced
that neither party will be able to con
quer the other â that is Russia will not
be able to penetrate into Japan and
administer a conclusive and lasting
overthrow and Japan will equally be
unable to penetrate into Russia and
give lasting effect to any temporary
triumphs."
Beaulieu seemed to base his convic
tion on the fact that after the first
great battle the contestants would find
the geographical obstacles 90 great as
to make decisive hostilities impossible,
Delcasse in personal conversation
with members of the diplomatic corps
does not conceal the gravity of the sit
uation, hut he holds that, even it a
diplomatic rupture occurs, this does
not mean an immediate outbreak of
hostilities. One of the leading diplo
mats asked Delcasse whether he con
sidered war a matter of a few days.
"On the contrary." the Minister re
plied, "I do not believe It likely to oc
cur for a month or two, even should
the negotiations completely fail."
This accords with the view of other
leading officials and diploma ts, who
hold that the failure of the negotiations
would be followed by a period of strat
egic preparations, of raising large war
funds and of maneuvering for position.
The raising of war funds is considered
here i as being one of the most vital
questions should the, negotiations fail.
Therefore a leading American official
sought to learn whether Russia would
be able to issue a loan and raise more
money here. He consulted with one of
the most eminent financiers of Prance,
connected with the Bank of Prance, and
this brought out some surprising state
ments concerning the enormous indebt
edness Russia has already incurred
here.
According to this financier Russia's
four loans total the colossal sum of
?1,45O,OOO,OOO, most of which came from
France. .Russia has now practically
used up these loans in building the
trans-Siberian railroad, the new fleet
and internal Improvements in the
waterways. The trans-Siberian line
alone has proved a terrible drain, the
deficit last year reaching 520,000,000.
Therefore in the event of a conflict
Russia must have some sinews of war,
and it is the conclusion of the financier
from the foregoing facts that she is not
likely to place a further loan in. Paris,
which heretofore has been her chief
financial reliance. On the other hand,
the diplomat compared this with the
announcement to-day from Tokio that
Japan has succeeded in securing volun
tary subscriptions of ,1,000,000 toward
her war fund. ,-i r J
"That would run a war for about one
day," said the diplomat. '.'With Russia
unable to get more money here anfl Ja
pan unable to get it at home, ft is be
lieved that if a break-down in the ne
gotiations occur each side will take a
long breath before fighting."
One of the officers of a trust company
of New York City who was recently
here reached the same conclusionâ that
Russia would be unable : to make a
loanâ after he had personally discussed
the subject with a number of leading
authorities on finance. ;
,A novel view is taken in a, certain
important diplomatic quarterâ that the
moat effective means of preserving
peace Is for both Russia and Japan to
claim a great diplomatic victory, thus
satisfying home sentiment and subdu
ing the war spirit. This view finds
rather serious acceptance at the For
eign Office, of which the officials say
, that if 'negotiations happily result in
peace both â¢ sides will claim a great
diplomatic triumph as a means of sat
isfying local sentiment. This ia given
by the officials as one of the main rea
sons why accounts vary concerning the
terms of the various notes, as it ia.
said that each side. has adopted a con
struction calculated to satisfy its own
people.' " ,.
~* One of the" most prominent ' of the
Russian officials said to-night that
definite knowledge concerning the con
tents of the Russian reply would be
communicated to the world certainly
by Monday. This official intimated
that at least some of the essential fea
tures had already been made known to
the French Government. He recogniz
ed that war would not be popular Jn
Russia because of the distance from
the scene of the conflict and the unfa
miliarity of the Russian people regard
ing the Question. At the same time
the official said:
""War can. be avoided if Japan is will
ing, for substantial concessions have
been ma9e upon which the negotiations
can continue. Russia is prepared for
eventualities and a rupture of the ne
gotiations â not aa ostentatiously as
Japan, but none the less effectively."
KURIXO PREPARES TO LEAVE.
Japan's Minister Will Close the St.
Petersburg Legation.
ST. PETERSBURG, Feb. 6.âJap
anese Minister Kurino is preparing to
leave St. Petersburg.
The Russian reply has been handed
to the Japanese Government by Baron
de Rosen, the Russian Minister in To
kio.
Russia is standing on the tiptoe of
expectancy and apprehension. Her
response having now reached the Jap
anese Government in Tokio. word
therefrom is awaited with extreme
anxiety. The feeling that Japan will
stand firmly on her former demands,
against whatever concessions Russia

nance of her pride, is becoming a con
viction here. An official of the For
eign Office said:
"The world understands our posi
tion pretty well. There is no reason
why the situation should be consid
ered changed. Russia has done her
utmost, but the other side must yield
if a common ground is to be found.
The Japanese people and. press have
been kept excited by false reports, In
vented, we believe, to create distrust
of our purposes and pacific Intentions.
How far the Japanese authorities can
withstand the popular tide is a ques

In sharp contrast with this calm
and even hopeful view voiced by the
Russian official is the gloom that pre
vails at the Japanese legation and
British embassy, where no efforts are
made to disguise the feeling of un
easiness. â¢
The belief, is almost openly express

of diplomatic negotiations. Minister
Kurino and Sir Charles Scott. British
Embassador to Russia, have been in
close conference, evidently determined
upon action to be taken in case of a
rupture of the negotiations, which, it
is believed, will be immediately fol
lowed by the breaking off of diplo
matic relations. In this event Kurino
will ask for his passports and will
leave St. Petersburg: at once. The
Minister has anticipated such a con
tingency and is making arrangements
to vacate the legation building. It
was even reported to-day on appar
ently good authority that Kurino has
ordered a special car to be In readi
ness at the Warsaw station to take
him to Germany.
The current affairs of the Japanese
legation will be turned over to the
British embassy, if the worst occurs.
The absence of Kurino from the the
atricals srrven at the Winter Palace
last night, which were attended by
all the other Ministers and by the Em
bassadors, was generally remarked.

GliOOM LX GREAT BRITAIN.
Outbreak In tlie Balkans Maj Fol
low Clash In Far East.
LONDON, Feb. 6. â The prospect for
a. great war breaking out in the Far
East, which is acknowledged even In
hitherto pacific quarters, has been
brought appreciably nearer by the de
velopments of the last day or two.
That a Russo-Japanese conflict will be
followed by a Balkan outbreak, which
In time may develop Into a widespread
European conflagration, is considered
probable and Increases the depression
pervading all political circles In
England and on the continent.
The British Postofflce emphasizes
the critical state of the situation by
announcing that code telegrams can
not be accepted for any place in Japan,
thus conSrining the New York an
nouncements to the same effect.
A dispatch to Reuter's Telegram
Company from St. Petersburg ears:
"An authoritative statement from a
Russian source regarding the contents
of the Russian reply to Japan Is as
follows:
"If the Japanese Government Is ani
mated by the same pacific sentiments
ea the Russian Government there is
reason to hope that it will give Rus
eia's fresh proposals such favorable
reception as to permit mutual accord
being finally reached. Baron de Rosen
has been furnished with all the neces
sary instructions for a fresh phase of
the negotiations."
With reference to the reiterated
Ftatement from Russian sources that
Russia could not agree to a Japanese
fortification of Southern Korea, as it
would endanger the neutrality of the
Straits of Korea, the Japanese lega
tion said to-day that Japan had al
ready recognized the reasonableness
of this contention on the part of Rus
sia and had readily agreed that the
passages of the Straits of Korea should
he perfectly free. Japan, however,
refused to agree to the neutral zone
suggestion because she believed It
would become virtually a Russian
sphere of influence in view of RuÂ£
r'.a's large concessions on the Talu
"River. Moreover if Japan had grant
rd this demand it would have been in
opposition to Japan's contention that
the Independence and integrity of
Korea must be recognized.
The scare in city circles here was
shown to-day by a wild report cur
rent on the Stock Exchanse that a se
vere naval engagement had taken
place, in which three Russian and two
Japanese ships were sunk.
BERLIN STILL HOPEFUL.
Professes Belief Tbat Japan Will Con
tinue Negotiations.
BERLIN, Feb. 6.â The announcement
that Russia's reply was handed to the
Japanese Government to-day -was com
municated to the Government depart
ments and embassies this afternoon.
Although the Foreign Office has not
been advised of the contents of the
ret* Jt still believes Japan will avoid
war and probably realize part of her
aims by occupying several places, both
on the coast of Korea and in the inte
rior of that country, which, It Is again
paid. Russia would not consider cause
for war.
At a recent Russian court ball, the

interest in the crisis by announcing the
arrest of Captain Warnecks and other
cCcers cf the German ship Helena
R'.ckmers on board their ship at the
Japanese port of Moji for having locked
up their Chinese crew to keep it from
deserting. The Germans were released
en the application of the German Con

Government Believes Required War

PARIS. Feb. 6.â The Temps' corre
spondent at St. Petersburg telegraphs
that the Russian reply is considered by
those close to Foreign Minister Lams
dorff as being of a nature to give sat
isfaction to Japan. He adds that, while
Ignorant of the contents of the reply,
it Is easy to divine that It is "couched
in most conciliatory terms and recog
nizes Japan's eoonomlo supremacy in
Korea, but opposes the erection of
fortifications at the principal strategic
points. In Manchuria Russia recog
nizes all the rights acquired, but will
make no engagements for the future."
The pacific disposition of the Czar
and Foreign Minister Lamsdorff is ex
pressed publicly. The Czar Is In ex
cellent humor and teems happy.
The mobilization of the expedition
ary co^ps is proceeding rapidly. War
will not be popular, and will not pro
voke enthusiasm, but will be none .the
less energetically conducted. The
finances of ttie empire are sufficiently
prosperous to provide the Government
with all the money it may need.
French" holders of Russian obliga
tions can close their ears to the cries
of alarm which have come them
from Germany and England and hold
all the Russian securities they possess,
knowing that Russia will not fail to
meet obligations.

positive statement of K. Uyeno, tht lo
cal representative of the Japanese
Government.
Just how many of the little brown
men will ba affected by this ukase It
Is Impossible to state. Consul Uyeno
states that no list exists In thla country
and the conscripts receive their order
direct from, the home Government
through relatives In Japan.
According to thÂ© laws of Japan, upon
the outbreak of war what Is termed the
"first call" Is sent out If deemed neces
sary by the Government This recalls
to Japan all those who have completed
their service in the Japanese army
within the last four years, no matter
what may be their present place of
abode.
Before being permitted to l*arÂ» the
Mikado's domain all Japanese subject
to recall under this law are required
to give a satisfactory bond. Insuring
their return when the Government feels
that their services may be required.
In this case the bondsmen of the "first
call" men were notified to produce them
at once, and as a result It Is probable
that the Gaelic, which sails for the
Orient on "Wednesday, will have on Its
passenger list the names of & number
of Japanese en route to defend the flag
of their native land. Among the local
Japanese these recall notices are con
sidered as practically a declaration of
war between Japan and Russia.
Consul Uyeno, when seen at his resi
dence yesterday afternoon by a repre
sentative of The Call, was very reticent
regarding the matter, claiming {hat hÂ«
had no official intelligence which he
was at liberty to make public. Of In
formation received unofficially, he said:
"Yes, it Is true that Japanese resid
ing In this city have been called home
to take up arms. To my personal
knowledge but two persons have re
ceived this notification. This is im
material, however, because If notice
was sent to one it was sent to all. Just
how many there are in the State or
country subject to recall I am unable
to state. The lists of names are kept
in Japan, and it would not be very
.good policy to allow them to become
public, as it would give an enemy an
opportunity to gauge our actual fight
ing strength more accurately than we
desire.
"The lists were not sent to me. and
will not be. "What information I have
came to me casually, but I am positive
that it is correct."
"Would you take this as an Indica
tion that your country was about to
declare war?" was asked.
The representative of the Mikado,
hesitated a moment, shrugged his
shoulders and gave the non-committal
reply: "May be; may be not."
"When pressed to be more definite he
smiled, his eyes twinkled and he re
plied: "Well, then, I think may be."
Consul Uyeno was naturally enthusi
astic regarding the fighting powers of
his country, which, he considers, is
only seeking justice." He has no fear
that a conflict with Russia would re
sult disastrously to Japan.

Colombia's Special Envoy to
America Chosen President
of South American Republic
WASHINGTON, Feb. 6.â A private
dispatch received here from Buena'
Ventura announces that General Reyes
was elected President of Colombia on
February 2. Gonzales Valencia was
elected vice president.
NEW YORK, Feb. 6.â General Rafael
Reyes, who Is on a mission to this
country from Colombia, said at the
Hoffman House. to-night that he had
received unofficial information from Co
lombia that he had been elected Presi
dent in the election of February 2.
General Reyes was asked of he would
accept If the report was true, and said:
"I have been In the United -States
trying to settle the differences between
the United States and my country and
I came here because I thought it my
duty to help my country If possible.
Similarly, if it is my duty to accept
the Presidency of Colombia, I -suppose
I would do so."
General Reyes said he would leave on
Tuesday on the Kaiser Wilhelm der
Grosse to go to Paris direct 'He would
not tell more about his trip except, that
be may go from that place to Colombia.
He said Dr. Herran would go to Co
lombia very soon and the Colombian
Legation in Washington would be
closed. The Consul General in New.
York City will have charge of Colom
bian affairs here in his absence.
General Reyes, in speaking . of the
canal, said he wished to further the
construction of the canal as far as he
could consistently with the honor of
Colombia. Matters now were at a
standstill, he said.
Odd Japanese Customs.
Japanese ladles have been known to
do without stockings to maintain the
harmony between beautiful French
slippers and magnificent French even-
Ing dresses. I have been served by a
Japanese hosier who did without every
thing he did . not supply himselfâ he
had a shirt, a collar and tie, and scarf
pin and studs, but no trousers. And the
effect of their absence was heightened
by his wearing, braces, because he sold
them. The Japanese do not kissâ if a
Japanese girl knows how to kiss it
shows the work of a foreign instructor;
she does it as an accomplishment, not
as an enjoyment. ; The Japanese have
no pens and Ink, but they make a very
good shift with a painting brush. The
Japanese houses have no chimneys, and
you are never warm enough until the
house catches fire. -The Japanese have
beef 'and no mutton; the Chinese have
mutton and no beef. Japanese -bells,
like Japanese belles, have no tongues.

IJea.vy shipments of Kimball. Decker,

have conie to us during the past â¢ few
days, and -we now p*" fcS iÂ»nt the choicest
array of Sne Pianos that has ever been
se^n in San Francisco.
One of our Piano cars met with an ac-
.cident. It must have been derailed, for
every one of the Pianos contained there-
in was more or less marred.
At firpt we would not accept them. But
we found that every one of the instru-
ments was absolutely perfect so far as
interior or mechanism is concerned.
Same as on a similar occasion two
years ago, the railroad claim agent pro-
'posed to us yesterday, in order to quick-
ly settle the matter of damages, that we
sell the Pianos at once, and whatever the
loss amounted to he would promptly re-
imburse us.
We finally agreed to this arrangement.
Th*Â» Pianos will be on display on our re-
tail salesrooms floor â 653 Market street
â practically at your own price.
Here Are the Prices:
Here is the greatest bargain opportu-
nity of ;.-ears. The railroad's loss is
your t*2iin. Think of it. You get a really
fine Piano; case may be marred here or
there, but scarcely noticeable; tone is
perfect, action is perfect; it is warrant-
ed in f-.vei-y way â and the railroad helps
you pay one-half; yes. in some cases,
even more than half the regular retail
price of the Piano.
Soir.e of those Pianos are the choicest
of regular ?500 Pianon. Hundreds of
them have been sold here in San Fran-
r\r-rn. by old-time high-price dealers, for
?500.
TÂ«3cc your choice to-morrow morning
of a half-dozen of beautiful mahogany
and mottled Enplish o?.k cases at the
cnifcrm price of $180.
And Some for an Even $125. .
Several of them that sustained more
severe tirulscs will go for $125, and a
< o'jple can be picked up for $100 each.
To Make You Doubly Sure.
Som* may doubt the genuineness of
this offer. To those we would suggest
i'ne payment Â«f J6 or $8 down, and bal-
ance in monthly payments of about the
Â»amÂ« amount. This will give you at
least thirty days to find nut exactly as
to the PIsno before you have made very
much of a payment. '
Bear in mind, too, that we ourselves

PEACE REIGNS
IN CHINATOWN
Tongs Lay Away Guns and Axes
Until After Their New Year
Holidays Come to a Close
Peace reigns in Chinatown again and
this condition will prevail until Chinese
New Year is at an end. An agreement
was reached by the warring tongs last
night by which hostilities will be sus
pended during the season of good-will
and axes and guns were immediately
piled on the shelves. Members of the
factions that have been in hiding since
the night of the first tragedies walked
forth once more, secure in the edict of
amity, and the district resumed its old
stir and action.
The recent war commenced between
the Wu Ting Tong and the Sen Sue
Ying Tong on one side and the Hop
Sing Tong on the other. Its beginning
was marked with unusual viclousness
and the entire Chinese quarter was
struck with terror. During its progress
several crimes have been committed,
from which deaths have resulted, and
all effort to restore friendliness be
tween the factions came to naught.
Metings have been held nightly, but
the representatives of each tong re
mained firm in a determination to bat
tle until one side or the other acknowl
edged defeat.
Yesterday the mercantile bodies of
Chinatown called the tong men to
gether and appealed to them to come
to some agreement by which their
weapons could be laid aside until after
the New Year festivities,* which begin
next week, are at an end. The mer
chants spoke of the injury to trade and
of the hesitation that has been "mani
fested by the Chinese in preparing for
festivities while matters remained as
they were. Time for consideration was
asked and last night the desired an
swer was given to the arbiters.
Beware the "Chrysumphalus Elinor."
The French Minister of Agriculture
has received from the Riviera a report
which shows that the orange growers
are threatened with the worst of ca
lamities. A microscopic insect, scien
tifically known as { chrysumphalus
minor, is the cause of an orange dis
ease as potentially destructive as .the
potato disease, which spread famine
and devastation over Ireland fifty
seven years ago. M. Belle, an expert
in Nice, has been investigating the
origin and propagation of this malady
among the oranges. The Council of
the department of Xice has taken the
matter in hand. Orange growers are
combining for the/ extirpation of
chrysumphalus minor. It is said that
the Insect was imported from Amer
ica some years ago and that the first
signs of its depredations were detected
in Florence. â New York' Commercial

"Yours Truly," "Sincerely," Etc.

Some men put It "As ever.V and others,
"Ever yours." Whenever a letter comes
to me addressed "Dear Friend," or
"Friend Tip," I have my doubts. "Dear

The familiar "dear" is become a mean

COUSINS FIGHT
OVER COOKING
During* Altercation in Fishing
Smack on the Bay Bales
tiere Brothers Are Slashed
WOUNDS ABE NOT FATAL
Trouble Is Precipitated by
Pietro Busalacchi's Criticism
of a Very Light Luncheon
A stabbing affray with many dram
atic features occurred on the bay yes
terday afternoon, and as a re
sult Frank Balestiere of j 167
Vandewater street is In a critical
condition from a knife thrust
in the side and- Vincenz Bales
tlere is, nursing a gash on the right
arm. Pietro Busalacchi, residing at
G82 Chestnut street, who wielded the
weapon, has been -booked on a charge
of an assault with a deadly weapon
and released on $50 cash bail.
All of the parties to the affair are
Italian fishermen and incidentally
cousins. Yesterday morning. In com
pany with two other relatives, they set
sail in their smack for the fishing
grounds. Nothing noteworthy occurred
until the noon hour, when In the vicin
ity of San Quentln It was decided to
partake of a light lunch. Busalacchi
either from a disordered stomach or
loss of appetite did not relish the food,
which had been prepared by Frank
Balestiere, and voiced his displeasure.
Balestiere had a reputation to sus
tain as a cook and retorted that the
food was too rich for B.usalacchi, who
he maintained was only acquainted
with plebean cooking. One word led to
another until Balestiere determined to
end the argument in an abrupt manner.
Seizing a hatchet Frank Balestiere
advanced toward Busalacchi. That
gentleman was averse to feeing used as
a chopping block and struck his angry
cousin on the head with a club. This
ended the disqute for the time being.
While Busalacchi was busily mending
his net Frank Balestiere determined to
be revenged and accordingly laid his
plans. He again seized his trusty
hatchet and endeavored to execute a
flank movement. Busalacchi was not
to be caught napping, however, and de
fending himself with a pocket knife,
which he jabbed into his assailant.
Vincenz Balestiere joined in the row at
this juncture and was cut on the arm.
Peace was finally declared and upon
the return to this city Dr. Louis D.
Bacigalupi was called to attend the
wounded men. Upon his advice Busa
lacchi surrendered himself and was
booked at the City Prison. Frank Bal
estiere's wound, although severe, is not
regarded as fatal.
A Hopkins Girl's Present.
A Hopkins girl, as a Christmas pres
ent, says the Hopkins Journal, sent her
photograph to Jier best fellow, wrapped
up in a newspaper on which waa print

A portion of the print adhered to the

SWINDLER
OF CHINESE
IN CUSTODY
Intended Victims Lure the Al
leged Culprit Into a Trap
and He Is Placed Under Ar
rest by Pittsburg Detectives
SELLS CERTIFICATES
OF REGISTRATION
First Gains the .Confidence of
an Immigrant.. Inspector by
Posing as .a Representative
of the Six Chinese Companies
PITTSBURG, Pa., Feb. 6.â Arthur S.
Spencer, who has been posing in PJtts
burg for the last week as an agent of
the Chinese Six Companies, was placed
in Jail to-night on a charge of imper
sonating a United States officer with
intent to defraud. Spencer Is alleged
to have served time in several differ
ent penal institutions in this country,
and is said to be one of the most no
torious swindlers who make the Chi
nese their victims. *His methods In this
city are said to have been the selling
of bogus registration certificates and
also getting money by other means.
Spencer called upon Immigrant In
spector Layton on Tuesday as a rep
resentative of the Six Companies and
as court interpreter. He presented a
plan by which he said he would hunt
out Chinese who had located in Pitts
burg without proper authority. Of
these he was positive twenty-five or
thirty had been smuggled in and should
be deported. Laundries! Chinese res
taurants and Chinese stores in all parts
of the cjty were visited by iLayton and
Spencer and the latter reported that
everything looked all right.
On Thursday, however, Lee Wung
and.' Lee Johnson, merchants, called
upon their attorneys and told them
that Spencer was trying to squeeze
money from them by selling them reg
istration certificates. They said they
knew Spencer because a Chinese pa
per, the Chung Sal Yat Po, published
in San Francisco, had printed a warn
ing to all Chinese to look out for him.
The case was then turned over to de
tectives, who arranged a meeting for
to-night between Johnson, Wung and
Spencer. When the Chinese had paid
Spencer $50 in marked bills for a cer
tificate of false registration, Spencer
was arrested and the* marked money
found on him: In default of $3000 bail.
Spencer was committed for a hearing
on Thursday morning.
The certificates given by Spencer ap
pear to be regular. Spencer denied his
guilt. The prisoner is about 40 years
of age and from appearance It would
be difficult to tell his nationality.

anxiously awaited by the miners, as
thus far the snowfall In- the mountains
is far below the average.
STOCKTON, Feb. 6.â Rain continued
falling throughout the afternoon and
evening and conditions indicate more
rain to-morrow. The faH to-day was
.24 of an inch, making 4.61 inches for
the season, as against 6.40. for the cor
responding season laat year. The mois
ture will be , of 'inestimable benefit to
the crops of this county and vicinity.
SAN JOSE. Feb. 6.â A light rain fell
this afternoon and evening, and there
is every indication that a storm is set
ting in. This afternoon .10 of an inch
fell. This, with the rain of Thursday,
will give the grain and hay a good
start. The rainfall to date is 3.73 inches,
against 9.27 inches to the same date
last year. Orchardists have become en
couraged and there has been a sale
of many trees for planting by the nur
series during the last week. Good feed
is insured on the cattle ranges and
arrangements are being made to ship
cattle from the adjoining counties. The
Santa .Clara College weather bureau
predicts, more rain for to-night and to
morrow.
SUISUN, Feb. 6.â The copious rainfall
throughput Solano County during the
past few days has greatly enhanced
the crop prospects, and the farmers and
fruit growers feel much encouraged at
the excellent conditions that prevail at
this time In favor of a prosperous sea-

son. While the rainfall Is yet somewhat
below the average at this season of the
year, still the situation is exceedingly
hopeful, as there is yet ample time for
an abundance of rain before winter is
over.
In Suisun Valley, a fruit section, the
rainfall this season is about ten inches,
only two inches below last year, and
the orchards are in fine condition. In
Green Valley, the cherry section, the
precipitation so far this season is about
twelve inches â very little short of that
of a corresponding date last year. On
the plains in the eastern and northern
portions of the county, the grain sec
tion, the rainfall has been ample, and
early-sown grain has grown so well
that stock has been turned upon it to
pasture. Feed is plentiful on the ranges
and stock is in excellent condition. To
sum the matter up, the crop prospects
in Solano County, both as to fruit and
grain, at this time of the year were
never more promising than at the pres
ent time.
COMES WITHOUT A WARNING.
Calculations of Meteorological Experts
Are Upset by the Storm.
"Storm No. 1 went over into Utah
and Nevada," said Professor McAdie
last night, "but storm No. 2 came in
unexpectedly from the ocean and dis
appointed us In our expectations of
fair weather for to-day." That is the
reason why it rained again yesterday
after the skies had cleared Friday
night. It was thus, too, that Central
and Northern California escaped a
cold snap.
Utah and Northern Arizona experi
enced the coldest weather of many
years yesterday. At some points in
that section of the country the mer
cury fell to 4 degrees below zero. Mc-
Adie states that perishable products
shipped East Thursday and Friday are
likely to spoil In transit as a result of
the low temperature.
' The rain was ' general throughout
Central and Northern California dur
ing the day and last night the storm
appeared to be making its way south.
The farmers and stock raisers will be
glad to see the continuation of wet
weather. Showers generally is the pre
diction for the whole of California to
day and snow and cold weather for
Utah, Nevada and Arizona.
THE GROWING TRADE
OP THE PHILIPPINES
For Eight Months of the Last Tear
â  the Increase In Commerce
Was $6,000,000.
The import and export trade of the
Philippine Islands for eight months
ended August, 1903, according to figures
appearing in the monthly bulletin of
the insular bureau of the War Depart-
ment, amounted to $43,133,804, the cor
responding period of 1902 showing but
$37,202,796, or an increase during the
present year of nearly six million dol
lars, over four-fifths of which may be
credited to shipments from the archi
pelago, the hemp and copra output be
ing especially large. These figures are
exclusive of coin and Government sup
plies, and in eight months of 1903 show
Imports $22,266,581 and exports valued
at $20,867,313.
The purchase of rice In large quan
tities continues, importations for the
month of August being greater than
the value entered under all other
classes of supplies combined, and with
the exception of the French Indies,
which furnishes the islands with nearly
all of the foreign product used, a gen
eral falling off i3 noted among the
principal importing countries, as com
pared with the recorfl for the previous
year. By the increase of approximate
ly three million dollars over the value
of rice receipts during eight months of
1902 the purchase of meat and meat
products, fish, vegetables and other
food stuffs, as well as the Import trade
in manufactured articles, has been ma
terially reduced. At the same time no
ticeable increase Is shown in the im
portation of cattle, many of which are
needed throughout the archipelago for
farming purposes.
Exports of hemp show an advance of
approximately three million dollars
over the figures of last year, in eight
months of 1903 reaching a value of $13
564,538, more than half of the product
being shipped to the United States.â

Pennsylvania Railroad Company
.Borrows $50,000,000 and
Market Shows thc Effects!
1VABASH PREFERRED FIRM
C'oppcr Shows Activity Since
thc Recent Supreme Court
Decision in State of Montana
NEW YORK. Feb. 6.â Thetction of
to-day's stoc**c n'.arkot reflected a feel
ing: of greater apprehension over the
rubject of bank loans than over the
impending war in the Far East. Prices
rebounded from the Blight opening de
gression reflected from foreign markets.
v.herÂ«> hope of a peaceful outcome v.-as
reported practically abandoned. The
borrowing of 550,000,000 by the Pennsyl
vania Company induced heavy selling
d " Pen.nnpylv2.nia Railroad stocks; the
letter company owning the stock of
the borTovring corporations caused a
marked impression in sentiment
throughout the street. The loss in
Pennsylvania Itself reached 1&. the
lowest price of the morning. Wabash
preferred v.as notably firm in spite of
the official disclaimers from Pennsylva
nia sources that the loan was to figure
IB any settlement of differences with
the TVabash. United States Steel pre
ferred also showed conspicuous resist
ance to the weakness elsewhere mani
fest. The tone of the market under
went a marktd chenge after the issu-
E2ice of the bank statement, and this
v.as clearly due to the moderate ex
j.ansion shown by the loan item, which
â¢aos not large enough to wipe out the
narrow margin below the billion dollar
mark at which the clearing-house loans
now stand. This effect of the bank
statement was made the more clear by
the fact that the reserve of the banks
showed a decrease of J2.4S3.100, where
en increase of almost equal amount had
been indicated.
PENNSYLVANIA I? LOWER.
*fhe inference drawn from the small
impression made upon the loan item
by the large money market operations
cf the wetk was that large corporate
requirements had already been provided
for by the enormous loan expansion
Fine* the first of the year. Pennsylva
nia's rally left its net loss less than a
point, and United States Steel preferred
and Wabash preferred finished the day
about a point higher than last night.
The closing was firm and practically
at the best prices.
The course of last week's stock
market seemed to be accepted by op
erators at the beginning of this week
as a satisfactory demonstration that
the attempt to bring about a specula
tive revival of the advance had proved
abortive. The market has declined in
activity and no organized efforts have
been any longer apparent to lift prices
or to attract a general demand. The
market has moved sluggishly and
irrtfc-ularry. but the average tendency
has been downward. The approach
of the crisis in the question of *var or
j.eace between Japan and Russia has
overhung; all the" speculative markets
with growing influence. Foreign se
curities have been almost stagnant on
the eve of the momentous decision,
and the most notable effect on our
own stock markets has been one of
constraint upon operations rather
than of weakness. As the threat of
â war vrzs recognized as one of the ,
causes for alarm the violent fluctua
tions in the commodity markets em- j
phasized the impression of the possi- j
ble effect of war upon securities. Be- I
sides this reflected war influence on !
the commodities the unstable condi- j
tion of values in these markets had its
own direct inf.uence in exciting un
easiness in financial quarters and in i
begetting a conservative spirit there.
The volatile uprush of cotton prices
bespoke a culmination of wild specu
lation there and the collapse during j
the \reek gave warning of extensive
speculative losses, such as are bound
to hs.ve some effect in the Wall street
1 market for quick liquidation from
whatever quarter they may come. The
rofTee market was another though a
lÂ»ss important source for this kind of
influence. Traffic and Industrial re
ports have not b*Â«n of a kind to help
in sustaining values.
SOUTHERN' PACIFIC SHOWING.
The returns of railroad net earnings
for December compare unfavorably
v. ;:.h December of the preceding year.
: showing the effects of thÂ« growth of
operating expenses in nearly all cases.
The Southern Pacific statement was a
notable exception owing to the ap
proach to completion of Its extensive
outlays for improvements, which have
been coming out of net earnings for a
long time past. This exception did
rs>t benefit the stock of that company,
while the Pennsylvania showing from
the falling off in iron and steel traffic
was ,j;sed trfth effect to depress that
stock.
Rumors of additional new capital is
fu?j by the Pennsylvania, which were
at first denied, were a factor in caus
ing 1 the decline of that stock- The re
turns of btoss earnings for the fourth
r.-rek in January, so far as reported,
rhow a decided falling off from the
correspondirur week of last year, the
.-iveras;e dstwrease running to over 12
per cent. Snov.- obstruction and bad
weather conditions are given as the
cfttxse* for lighter traffic. These con
ditions cause a rise in the unfavorable
net returns to come.

rn^nt of a decision by the Montana Su

the Amalgamated Copper Company to
hold stocks of other corporations re
sulted in a culmination of a specula
tive movement in that stock. Currency
has moved freely to New Orleans dur
ins the week and interior exchange
has moved against New York. Thi3
development has bad added influence
by reason of the notice by the Secre
tary of the Treasury of a call in ten
days for payment of 20 per cent of
Government deposits in national banks
to provide for the Panama canal pay
rm-nt. The extraordinary figure at
which New York bank loans now
stand and the promise of additional
large requirements for railroad and
corporation purposes prompt a con
servative use of credits for speculative
purposes
Bonds have turned heavy on a di

GALLOWS ROPE
ENDS HIS LIFE
William Glover, Who Killed
the Father of the 'Girl He
Loved, Dies at Folsom
EXECUTION IN THE PRISON
Efforts to Obtain Executive
Clemency Fail and the Ex
treme Penalty of Law Is Paid
BACRAMBNTO, Feb. Â«. â William
Glover was hanged at Folaom prison
at IS o'clock to-day for the murder of
Frederick Nierhoff of Placer County.
The body was pronounced lifeless In
fourteen minutes. Ths hanging was
entirely without incident. Glover did
not make a statement. He accepted
the religious ministrations of a Catholic
priest. His brother, Oscar Glover, was
at thÂ» prison but remained at thÂ» Cap
tain's office during the execution.
Glover was convicted on September
8, 1902, of having killed Nierhoff near
Auburn on the 11th day of June, 1902,
and on September 29, 1902, he was sen
tenced by â  Judge Prewett of Placer
County to be hanged seventy-five days
later. The matter was delayed by an
appeal to the- Supreme Court, which re
sulted in the affirmation of the Judg
ment of the lower court. On January
11, 1904, he was resentenced to bo
hanged on February 6. An appeal for
executive clemency was made by his
attorney.
The killing of Nierhoff by Glover was
presumed to have been the outcome of
an attachment formed by the latter for
tha former's fourteen-year-old daugh
ter, Agnes Nierhoff. William Glover
and his brother, Oscar, were owners
and operators of a mine on the Ameri
can River, near tha Nierhoff ranch.
They were frequent visitors to the
Nierhoff home, and unknown to the
parents of Agnes an attachment was
formed between her and William
Glover, who was about twice her age.
The father requested Glover to cease
paying attention to his daughter, and
the latter ordered him to keep away
from the premises. On the day of the
murder Glover paid a visit to Miss
Nierhoff In the absence of the father.
As he was leaving the house Nierhoff
arrived. Some words ensued and
Nierhoff was shot by Glover, who had
a rifle with him. Miss Nierhoff and
Oscar Glover were witnesses to the
shooting. The Coroner's Jury rendered
a verdict to the effect that the killing
â was premeditated and without provo
cation, and also that Oscar Glover was
an accessary to the crime.
The trial of William Glover lasted
four days and the jury found him guilty
of murder In the first degree, after de
liberating five hours. Oscar Glover
was tried for complicity in the crime
and was acquitted, j Glover accepted
the death sentence with stolidity, and
all he ever said is that he "got the
worst of it." . â¢

SEEK TO STOP
FLOOD DAMAGES
Land Owners in Sacramento Val
ley Meet to Discuss Improve
ment of River Conditions
AGREEMENT IS POSTPONED
Representatives From Various
Sections Not Yet Decided on
.the Solution of a Problem
Special Dispatch to Tht Oil.
SACRAMENTO, Feb. 6.â !A.n Im
portant conference of up-river and
down-river land owners was held to
night with Frank D. Ryan, State Com
missioner of Public "Works, the auditing
board of the commission and Colonel
W. H. Heuer, representing the Federal
Government, with reference to the re
lief of the river section from the effect
of annually recurring floods.? .
Colonel Heuer said there were two
ways of solving the problem â one by a
cut-off and the other by widening the
channel. He added that personally he
favored the widening of the channel.
The down-river land owners argued in
support of a- cut or channel through
Horseshoe bend. This proposition was
favorably considered by the commis
sioner and the auditing board until it
was discovered that the. land owners
would not give a free right of way. The
last Legislature appropriated $200,000
for the river improvements.
It was decided to hold another con
ference on February 15, at which it Is
hoped to reach an agreement as to how
the flood waters shall be disposed of.

Mr. Bryan was ill at ease. Finally
he sent a boy out to find Albert Barr,

was at church, but left at once and
went to the hotel. Mr. Bryan took
him to one side and said: "Will you
come to my room for a minute?"
Baiy followed to the elevator, won

was to share. After they reached the
room Mr. Bryan closed the door and
said:
"Barr, you know I missed my train
at Buffalo, and must get to Hunting

"Yes," said Barr. .
"Well. I wish you would lend me

BARBAROUS SURGICAJj OPERA-
For Cure of Piles
Is not only Intensely painful, dangerous
to life and very expensive, but In the
â¢light of modern medical research and
since the discovery of the Pyramid Pile
Cure, wholly unnecessary. If you have
any doubt on this point kindly read the
following letter from one who knows
that the claims regarding the merits
of the Pyramid Pile Cure are borne out
by facts:
"For a lonp time I suffered with blind
piles. They gave me so much pain and
uneasiness that they almost disqualified
me for doing anything. 1 saw aiTad in
the Atlanta Journal of .Pyramid Pile
Cure and ordered a 50-cent box. I used
tb^m and they gave me relief;. that en-
couraged me and I bought another 50-
cent box and they cured me. Oh, how
glad that' I- am^well again! .v.^; .
"The Pyramids cured me and ; I am
satisfied they will cure anybody else
who is suffering as I was. If they will
use them.
; ?'Tou may use this in , any way you
see , proper; if my experience will en-
courage any sufferer to use â¢ your. Pyra-
mids I shall be glad. H. K. HICKS,
Calhoun, Ga." /
The Pyramid Pile Cure Is sold , by
druggists ; for , 60 f cents a package, and
its merit is so well known that the sales
exceed ; those of all similar remedies

GENERAL MACARTHUR
CALLS OX DICKINSON'
Commander of This Federal Army
Division Pays Compliment to the
National Guard.
General MacArthur, accompanied
by his aid, Major Parker W. West,
made an official call upon Major Gen
eral John II. Dickinson, division com
mander. National Guard of California,
yesterday at 12 o'clock at the head
quarters reception rooms in the Oc
cidental Hotel.
* General Dickinson was surrounded
by his staff. Captain T. Waln-Morgran
Draper, Lieutenant Colonel J. A. Kos
ter. Lieutenant Colonel A. Huber and
Lieutenant Colonel Louis Barrere.
The call lasted for over an hour, dur
ing which time the two chiefs were
enfe'aged in active and animated con
versation. Xaturally the impending
crisis in the Orient was the basis for
a good deal of the discussion. Shortly
after 1 o'clock General MacArthur
withdrew amid heartiest expressions
of the kindest feelings existing be
tween the army of the United States
and the State militia.
General MacArthur did not make
his intended official call on Captain
Ulrico Piscetto, commander of the Ital
ian cruiser Puglia. The preparations
being made on board the foreign war
vessel for immediate departure to the
Orient are such that the ship was not
in shape to receive visitors, which in
formation was conveyed to General
MacArthur by a messenger" sent by-
Captain Piscetto yesterday morning.
The vessel is being coaled in such
haste that she is covered with dust
from end to end and. was In no con
dition to receive visitors. Major West,
aid to General MacArthur, went' on
board to informally return the cal} of
the foreign commander.

HEALTH OFFICIALS RAID
CHEAP LODGIXG-HOUSE
Abate Nuisance by Carting Off the
Beds and Bedding, Which Are
Burned as Unsanitary.
.vjA number of health inspectors un
der the si/pervision of Chief Inspect
ing Physician Hassler made a raid
early yesterday morning on a 5-cent
lodging-house known as the "Crystal
Palace" in the basement of the prem
ises at the southwest corner of Third
â¢and Howard streets. Complaint had
been made to Health Officer Ragan
that the lodging-house was 'in an un
sanitary condition and steps were tak
en at once to abate the nuisance.
The inspectors routed out some
ninety-four men that were sleeping
in the place and at once began to
throw out the so-called beds and bed
ding on the sidewalk. The beds were
bunks made of a few sticks of wood
and the bedding mostly old sacks,
which were found to be full of vermin.
So .bad were the conditions that, the
stuff was all carted away to a lot at
North Beach and burned. The place
was run' by Hahn & Bolemans and
was. frequently complained of by
passers by, and recently twelve of the
lodgers were arrested for vagrancy.'

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL', ] SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 7, 1904.
WEBER & FIELDS BRING
CARLOADS OF JOLLITY
Special "Train- Arrives With All-Star Company and
Eighty Pretty and Talented GirlsâComedians
Tell of Some Funny Happenings on the Journey
. Four carloads of human Jollity
rolled into the mole station at 5:30
o'clock yesterday afternoon and the
much-advertised Weber. & Fields spe
cial train had completed its run from
New York. Five minutes later the
playerfolk, more than 100 In number,
were braving i~. the drizzle on the top
deck of the ferryboat Oakland and
trying to distinguish the San Fran
cisco shore line through the heavy
murk, for more than two-thirds of
them had never seen the city in which
for the next two weeks' the entire big
company -Is to form one of the theat
rical attractions.
Allthe celebrities pictured on the
posters were there. Lillian Russell,
looking not a minute older or less
pretty than when she was last here,
eleven years ago, hugged a Japanese
poodle and pointed out familiar ob
jects to her sister, Mrs. Westforde,
who is her companion on the tour.
And there was "Pete" Dailey, rotund
as ever and with his face divided by
the same old smile. Charles J. Ross
and his wife. Mabel Fenton, who
charmed Orpheum audiences about a
year ago, were among those present.
John T. Kelly, who is trotting a tie
with Mr. Dailey for the corpulency
stakes, smiled and nodded at the
spires that loomed faintly through the
fog as the Oakland neared her slip,
for he was well and favorably known
to the San Franciscans of a decade
ago, when Walters ran the Orpheum
and the Wigwam was an institution.
Then there was Louis Mann, with the
face of a poet and the temperament of
a comedian, and there also were
Weber and Fields themselves, the two
young men who are responsible for
the whole great all-star aggregation.
Keen and intelligent chaps they are,
with a respect-compelling presence
that their bright amiability serves to
enhance. As "the boys" they are ad
miringly spoken of by their older
stage companions.
SOME STUNXIXG GIRLS.
There, too, were the eighty stunning
girls who make up the famous Weber
and Fields chorus. Chappiedom may
be interested in the announcement
that a larger or prettier corps of
young women never came into the
West. Every one of them is fair to
look upon, and not one of them â oh,
rarity of rarities in the matter of cho
rus women â looks to be more than
20 when off the stage. When they
arrived in San Francisco last evening
they had just completed a five days'
train ride, yet they appeared as fresh
and chipper as if they had been spe
cially made up from the front row of
a "show piece."
Stage Manager Ben Teal was of the
party, and so was Music Director
Francis, with about a score of his in
strumentalists.
Did they have a pleasant trip?
Could such a crowd have any other
kind of a trip?
When the train was boarded by a
Call representative at Sacramento he
found the principal members of the
company in their own special car. Some
of them were indulging in the delights
and sorrows of a card game â "twenty
one" it was â while others perused the
San Francisco morning papers, which
had just arrived. Miss Russell was
hastily scribbling something on a tele
graph blank, while the colored porter
waited to carry it to the operator.
"What's your favorite?" asked Mr.
Ross, eagerly.
"Faulconbridge," replied the best-pre
served woman on earth, "and I'm put
ting fifty on him. He's a pick-up at the
odds."
It was the Burns handicap. Miss
Russell's "tlD" was followed by some
of the others, and the colored servitor
was kept busy trotting between the
car and the telegraph office until the
train resumed its journey. .
"I love horse-racing," said Miss Rus
sell to The Call, "but I don't gamble
much on it â Just enough to keep my
interest from flagging, you know."
THE RUSSELL GAIT.
"That's the Russell gait," said Mr.
Kelly, pointing through the car win
dow at a "crowd of chorus girls who
were briskly Walking up and down the
platform. "Miss Russell, you know,"
he explained, "is a great walker, and
every time the train has stopped for
more than a minute she has hastened
out and taken a constitutional canter.
When the girls began to get stiffened
by inaction they followed her example,
and now they all have the habit."
"And it's doing them lots of good,"
paid Miss Russell, "and it would do you
and Mr. Dailey lots of good if you
would follow their example."
"Mr. Dailey and I," retorted Mr. Kelly,
GRAPE-NUTS.
WETili POSTED.
A California Doctor With Forty Years'
Experience.
"In my forty years' experience as a
teacher and practitioner along hygienic
lines," says a Los Angeles physician, "I
have never found a food to compare
with Grape-Nuts for the benefit of the
general health of all classes of people.
I have recdrnmended Grape-Nuts for
a number of years to patients with the
greatest success, and every year's ex-
perience makes me more enthusiastic
regarding its use.
"I make it a rule to always recom-
mend Grape-Nuts and Postum Food
r Cpffee in place of coffee when giving
jny patients instructions as to diet, for
I know both Grape-Nuts and Postum
'can.be digested by any one.
"As for myself, when engaged in
much mental work my diet twice a
day consists of Grape-Nuts and rich
cream. I ljnd It just the thing to build
up gray matter and keep the brain in
good working order.
"In addition to its wonderful effects
as a brain and nerve food Grape-Nuts
always \ keeps the digestive organs in
perfect, healthy tone. I carry it with
me when I travel, otherwise I am al-
most certain to have trouble with my
stomach.'.' Name given by Postum Co.,
Battle Creek, Mich.
â¢Strong indorsements like the above
from physicians all over the 'country
have stamped Grape-Nuts the most
scientific food in the world.
There's a reason.
Lot/k in each package for the famous
little book, "The Road to-Wellville."
"scorn your suggestion. Our good looks
cannot be impaired by Inertia."
Mr. Dailey smiled gratefully at Mr.
Kelly, and Miss Russell stared coldly at
both of them.
"Oh, we've had a picnic of a time,"
said, Mr. Dailey in response to the ste
reotyped query. "So that story of the
girls and their colored maids has got
out here ahead of is, has it? But have
you heard the sequel? No? Well, that's
the best part of it."
"When the girls appeared at the New
York depot with colored maids you said
they reminded you of the Sunday news
papers, because they had colored sup
plements," said the interviewer.
"That's right, and the big joke is that
the supplements were not maids at all,
but mothers."
"Mothers?"
"Yes, mammas. You see, the girls
could not bring along their mothers at
the company's expense, but under their
contract each of them was entitled to
have one maid. So what did the cun
ning things do but black up their mam
mas, introduce them as their maids and
get them aboard. Five of them did that,
and the following. morning there was
not a colored lady aboard the train, but
five white-faced matrons were among
the passengers. They are still with us.
We have a mothers' congress in the
next car."
ROSS FINDS THE EGG.
"Nice trip?" said Mr. Ross. "You've
said it. From the hour we left New
York until the present minute dullness
has not visited }is. Some of the girls
tried to be homesick, but we wouldn't
let them."
"How did you prevent it?"
"Oh, in various ways," chipped in
Mrs. Boss. "We had theatrical enter
tainments and dancesâ "
"Dances?"
"Yes; I must tell you about that.
One morning we decided to give a
show, so we posted a copy of this bill
in each car," and the lady presented
the following written "display." a la
poster:
"Car 4 Opera-house. To-day, 4
p. m. Special matinee. Home talent.
Admission free. Carter de Haven,
Lynn sisters and others. Don't forget
time and place. Car 4 Opera-house.
To-day, 4 p. m."
"At the appointed time' the place
was full â you never saw such a pack
ed house," said Mr. Dailey. "And I
might add that the enthusiasm was
terrific. Great bill, you know. Car
ter de Haven opened it by doing an
egg-disappearing trick. The egg dis
appeared after the conjurer had hand
ed it to Louis Mann and nobody could
find it until I sat down. Then every
body immediately knew that it had
been found. No, this is another coat.
Then the Lynn sisters sang coon bal
lads. After the applause had subsided
we had a neat thing from Weber and
Fields. They sang 'Here We Are,
Two Irish Ladg.' More hpplause, and
then Miss Lillian Russell sang the
lullaby .from 'Erminie,' and .we had
more applause. It was a great- show."
"But the other principals^ â what did
you do?"
"I tried to dodge that, but I'm a
sport when cornered. Well, I was one
of the Tremendous Trio â Kelly, Ross
and Dailey. It was a minstrel first
part act, and Mr. Ross was the con
versationalist in the center, while Mr.
Kelly battered the tatnbo and I wield
ed the bones. When we concluded
singing, .'Leaf by Leaf the Roses Fall,'
all the ladles wept and the gentlemen
looked as if the trip was beginning
to wear on their nerves. That finished
the show."
"After which," Mrs. Ross resumed,
"we cleared the dining car for danc
ing, tripped it merrily "
"Staggered it, you mean?" put in
Mr. Ross.
"You may have staggered after
ward," replied the lady, "but we
women did not."
GAY TIME AT TERRACE.
"Some truth in that, too," said Mr.
Dailey. "Owing to want of space we
had only three pieces in the orchestra,
and when they played 'Home, Swefct
Home,' the ladies sought refuge in
tears and the gentlemen "
"Drowned their sorrow Jn beers â I
told you so," was the lady's triumph
ant shout.
"Well." said Mr. Dailey, reflectively,
"we left no calls for next morning."
Then ,they told of their time at
Terrace, which is a hamlet In Utah.
Their train was delayed at Terrace
pending the settlement of a dispute
between Messrs. Weber and Fields
and the station agent as to whether
that official had the right to tack twp
or three cars to the tailend of the spe
cial. While the wires were working â
and it may not tie amiss to state here
that the station agent lost the argu
ment â the members of the company
inspected Terrace. One of the girls
had a kodak and when she set it down
upon the depot platform while she
fastened her hood more securely, a
tall and ungainly native placed a
cowhide boot upon the box and said
"Shine this one first, sis." Then an
other resident guaranteed Mr. Weber
a $40 audience if he jvould allow his
company to give a show at the "op'ry
house," and Mr. Weber had not fully
digested the proposal when the train
bell summoned all aboard. It was at
Terrace that Miss Russell won the
everlasting esteem of a seller of gen
eral merchandise by allowing him to
present her with a box of chocolate
creams, and it was another merchant
of Terrace who produced a bucketful
of nickels in order to allow the actor,
folk to play his slot machine â and
lose their money. Every member of
the company had something funny to
tell about Terrace.
Mr. Weber and Mr. Fields were
hearty contributors to all the laughs
that rang through the car, and it was
with some difficulty that either of the
young men r could be induced to. speak
seriously of their mutual enterprise.
"We came out here," Mr. 1 Weber
said, "simply because we wanted to
get away from the bear-bating that
New York theater managers have
been subjected to ever since the Chi
cago holocaust. We could have re
mained in our own house, which is
entirely safe, and played to its- ca
pacity, but we, thought; it wisest to let

MINT RECEIVES
ORDER TO RUSH
Government Demands Produc
tion of Twenty Dollar Pieces
Amounting to $40,000,000
WORKING NIGHT AND DAY
No Explanation Is Offered, but
All Other Work Is Sus
pended for the Present
There is much doing at the United
States Mint in this city. ' Orders have
been received from Washington by the
superintendent of the Mint to suspend
all work of the routine sort, in fa'ct all
the work upon which he has been en
gaged recently and to turn out as many
twenty-dollar gold pieces in the next
two months as possible. Before a final
order was issued to proceed exclusively
with the minting of twenty-dollar gold
pieces a Query waa sent out as to what
could be done.
Superintendent Leach answered that
it would be possible to coin $80,000,000
in the designated gold golns in two
months. The Government did not seem
to be satisfied with this large output
and desired that the total should be
increased by at least $10,000,000. mak
ing the total gold coin production from
$40,000,000 to $45,000,000. The people at
the Mint will now try to make the rec
ord of $40,000,000 at least in the suc
ceeding two months and the machinery
and skilled men will be kept steadily
at work day and night for the period
mentioned.
WHY IT IS WAJfTED.
The orders from Washington did
not specify for what purpose the
money Is to be used, but as the mints
of the country have been working
upon the new Philippine coinage,
which Is all silver, and as the amount
ordered from the San Francisco Mint
tallies with the amount that is to be
paid to Panama and the French stock
holders of the old Panama Canal Com
pany Mr. Leach believes that a San
Francisco coinage is to be used for
this purpose. "Work upon this hurry
up order Is already under way and the
Mint is full of activity. Mr. Leach
6aid last night:
"I received an order about the 1st
of February from Washington to coin
all the cold possible within the next
sixty days, the Intention being to turn
out at least $45,000,000 in that time,
which will be the largest coinage ever
accomplished by the United States
Government in the same period of
time. We shall turn out, I think,
about $1,000,000 a day, which means
about two tons of bullion.
"The reason for this heavy coinage
of gold is that for the past year and a
half we have been working upon sil
ver and only coined sold at times
when the silver ran short. During
the last calendar year the coinage has
been nearly all silver, allowing the
gold to accumulate until at the pres
ent time we have nearly one hundred
million dollars worth of gold bullion
stored in the vaults of the San Fran
cisco Mint. This gold has been com
ing in since 1897, and In the last two
months we have received almost nine
million dollars in gold from Japan,
and this must also be coined as soon
as possible. Another reason for the
neglect in the coinage of gold has been
the necessity of turning out a large
amount of Philippine silver.
"I believe, however, that there are
other reasons for this order for a heavy
coinage of gold. According to the dally
papers, the Government is being
brought face to face with several large
payments, aggregating in the neigh
borhood of $80,000,000. and I believe that
it is to obviate the necessity of calling
In the deposits in the national banks
that this order has been issued. A no
tice was served upon these banks about
the same time that the order was re
ceived by the San Francisco Mint to
prepare to meet a demand for twenty
per cent of these deposits and I think
that the Treasury Department has de
cided to coin the bullion now on hand
rather than call in the deposits, or any
part of them, In the national banks.
NOTHING UNUSUAL.
"There is nothing unusual In the or
der excepting the short time given for
the coinage of $45,000,000 in gold, which,
as I have said, is the largest amount
ever coined in this, or, I believe, in any
country In the same period of time.

ELECTRIC CARS
ON NEW ROUTES
United Railroads Is Making
Changes Preparatory to Im
proving: the Local Service
BIG MOTORS ARRIVING
Traveling Public Will Be Af
forded More Conveniences on
Their Trips Around the City
The announcement was made yes
terday by Manager Chapman of the
United Railroads that beginning to
morrow a number of changes will be
made in the present routes of electric
; car lines. On the park and ocean
line inbound cars, by way of H
street, which now run along Frederick,
Stanyan, Page, Devlsadero and Ellis
streets, will after Monday be operated
along Fillmore street, instead of De
vlsadero, and the outbound cars will
be operated by way of Ellis, Hyde,
O'Farrell. Fillmore, Oak, Stanyan.
Frederick and H streets, the change In
the routing being the substitution ot
Fillmore street for Devisadero, as In
the case of the inbound cars.
Another change will be on the Ma
sonic-avenue line. The present route
of the Inbound cars is by way of
Parnassus avenue, Stanyan, Carl, Clay
ton and Frederick streets. Masonic
avenue and Page street, thence to Fill
more and Oak streets. Outbound cars
travel via "Oak street, Masonic avenue,
Frederick. Clayton. Carl and Stanyan
streets and Parnassus avenue. .Under
the proposed change the cars will -not
run by way of Oak and Page streets,
and the terminal of the Inbound cars
will be at Oak street and Masonic ave
nue, instead of Oak and Fillmore
streets.
The changes aro made preliminary
to the introduction of the new and
larger cars on the main lines of the
electric service. The majority of these
cars have already arrived from the
East and are now being put together
in the shops of the company. The
cars are of the most modern com
bination type, 89% feet long, and
weigh 33,500 pounds.
They differ materially from the
combination car now in use. The lat
ter have longitudinal seats on the
dummy sections, while the seats on the
new cars face to the front and are
divided by an aisle, an arrangement
made feasible by the law requiring the
adoption of air brakes on all double
truck cars. Iron railings extend along
the dummy sections, thus preventing
persons from alighting while the cars
are in motion.
Another feature of the new cars is
that they have only one exit on each
side, which regulates the getting on
and off of the cars on the right-hand
side, or side farthest from the rails of
the car running in the opposite direc
tion. An innovation will be an elec
tric button, by which means passen
gers that wish to alight will be re
lieved of the annoyance of having to
rise and signal the conductor when
cars are crowded or the conductor's
attention is being diverted. These
buttons connect with an electric bell,
the ringing of which will advise the
conductor of the desire of the passen
ger to alight.
Jury FaUs to Indict Boxers.

averaged from $40,000,000 to $80,000,000
Coiner Dan T. Cole Bald last even
ing that it was true that the local
United States Mint was to be worked
to the limit of its capacity in making
the double eagles. H e did not know
what was signified. It was probable,
he thought, that the other mints of the
United States may be pressed to turn
out coinage. In the past few months
the local Mint and also the Mint at
Philadelphia have been turning out
millions of dollars' worth of pesos for
use in the Philippine Islands, Con
gress having provided for the estab
lishment of a uniform currency for the
islands.

A CoUyer-Beecher Story-
"Pew sleepers are one of the bug
bears of preachers," said the Rev.
Robert Collyer, the veteran New York
minister. "I can speak feelingly from
experience. On one occasion when
Henry Ward Beecher asked me to go
to Plymouth Church to talk to his peo
ple, he remarked â jokingly, let us
hope â that most of them were hard
work folk who needed plenty of rest
on Sunday, and he felt that a sermon
from me might be gratefully received.
"In the course of my talk I men
tioned this and said it was, however,
a matter upon which my feelings could
not be hurt, and that I owed this im
perviousness to Mr. Beecher himself.
I told them that, one Sunday, years
before, when I was attending a ser
vice at old Plymouth and Mr. Beecher
was thundering forth, I saw one of his
deacons asleep In a front pew.
"I went on to say that always after
this, whenever I saw a man slumber
ing peacefully through my most stir
ring efforts in the pulpit, I would say
to myself: ;Well, let him sleep; even
the great Beecher can't keep 'em all
awake.' "

To Be Decided Later.
The boy, who was visiting his indul
gent aunt, had eaten heartily of the
preserves. â  .
"Don'f you think you've had enough,
Willie ?*: she asked.
"Don't know." he replied.
"Don't know?"
"Nope. Can't. tell yet," he said.
"But what do you think?"
"Ain't any use thinking at all. I got
to know. v Thinking don't help any if
you think wrong." /
"Well, you're the most remarkable
boy I everknew," said his aunt. "When
will you know?"
"In half an ' hour." '
"And how will you know?"
"Why, that's easy," replied the wise
bov. "If I- ain't sick In half an hour
I'll be sorry'. I "didn't, take 'more, and if
I am sick I'll be sorry I took so much.
That's . the only way. to : tell that I
know.".
His .aunt' admitted .that, it left no
room for doubt, but she to point
out that, it was rather." unsatisfactory,
to which the boy merely .replied that

he didn't know of 'J any.â Brooklyn

Model Dog Pound In Paris.
Lovers of dogs will be happy to know
that the Paris dog pound â fourriereâ
has been entirely remodeled at the ex
pense of the Society for the Protection
of Animals and the sum expended
amounts to $4000. There are now 200
kennels and that Is sufficient to allow
a separate place for each dog until he
is reclaimed or put to death. The dog
gies have electric light, which is a real
luxury in these dark days. The ken
nels are . disinfected every time ' they
have been occupied and wonderment
asks whether people who work hard
day and night to feed and keep their
families ought not to be as well treated
as dogs. â Exchange.
Realism Unrehearsed.
A mock stage tragedy at "Warsaw
recently took on a very realistic as
pect. The piece was Tschaikowsky's
"Eugenvo Onegin," in which there is
a duel in which the tenor, who on this
occasion was M. Lebedeff, is shot by
Onegin, falling dead on the boards
without a cry. In fact, on the pistols
being discharged. Lebedeff fell utter
ing loud cries of pain, and on being
carried behind the scenes it was found
that he had been shot in the eye,
which was utterly destroyed. At pres
ent nothing is known as to how a bul
let got into the pistol, but a good deal
of suspicion attaches to the case. â

THE VALUE OF CHARCOAL.
Frtr People Know How Useful It Is
in Preserving Health and Beauty. j
Nearly everybody knows that char-
coal is "the safest and most efficient
disinfectant and purifier in nature, but i
few realize its value when taken into
the human system for the same cleans-
ing purpose.
Charcoal is a remedy that the more
jou take of it the better; it is not a j
drug at ail, but simply absorbs the |
{rases and impurities always present in j
the stomach and intestines and carries
them out of the system.
Charcoal sweetens the breath after j
f rooking, drinking or after eating
Â«-nionÂ» and other odorous vegetables.
Charcoal effectually clears and Im-
proves ttoe complexion, it whitens the j
f-eth and further acts as a natural
had eminently safe cathartic. â 
It absorbs the injurious gases which i
f ollect in the stomach and bowels; It |
cislnfects the mouth and throat from
the poison of catarrh.
All druggists sell charcoal In one
form or another, but probably the best
charcoal and the most for the money
is in Stuart's Absorbent Lozenges;
they are composed of the finest pow-
dered willow charcoal and other
harmless antiseptics in tablet form or
rather in the form of large, pleasant
tusung lozenges, the charcoal being
mixed with honey. !
The daily use of these lozenges will
*con tell in a much improved condi-
;ion of the general health, better com-
l :exion, sweeter breath and purer
i.'.ooA. and the beauty of it Is that no
t jfisible harm can result from their
- ontinued use, but, on the contrary,
t;reat benefit
A Buffalo physician in speaking of
'he benefits of charcoal says: "1 advise
â â ;toart*s Absorbent Lozenges to all pa-
tients suffering from gas in stomach
.and bowels and to clear the complex-
ion and purify the breath, mouth and
;hroat; I also believe the liver is great-
!y benefited by the daily use of them;
they cost but 25 cents a box at drug
tiores. and although In some sense a
latent preparation, yet I believe I get
more and better charcoal in Stuart's |
Absorbent Lozenges than in any of the J
ordinary charcoal tablets." '

DOCTORS CURE
HIS INSANITY
Patient at the Napa State
Hospital Recovers His Reason
After a Skillful Operation
Special Dispatch to Ths Cfcll
NAPA, Feb. 6. â An interesting opera
tion was performed at the State Hos
pital for the Insane last Monday by
Dr. â¢ Stone, assisted by Drs. Pulslf er,
Sticc and Cohen upon a parent,
George Argyris.
Argyris is a Greek, 19 years of age.
Ten years ago Jn his native country,
his skull was fractured, but he seem
ed soon to recover from the injury.
Shortly afterward he came to this
country. â¢ He worked for his brother
in a restaurant in the Latin quarter
of Fan Francisco. A few months ago
he got into a fight' with the cook and
was struck with a poker over the right
ear. The spot was where his skull had
been fractured years before.
The effects of 'this blow seemed to
drive him insane, and he wandered
about from place to place in an aim
less manner, and was recently arrest
ed in Sonoma County for robbery. He
was deemed more, fit for an asylum
than a prison, and was' committed to
Xapa Hospital. Here an operation
was decided upon, and was performed
on Monday. The skull was opened and
a large tumor that was pressing
against, the brain was removed. The
skull section which had been cut out
was replaced by a "bone button."
Argyris' mental powers have been com
pletely restored, and in all probability
he will soon be discharged as com
pletely cured.

SUPERSTITIOUS GAMBLERS
AVIN LARGE SU3I OF MONEY
After Persistent Run of Bad Luck
They Play >*o. 13 to Sorrow of
Monte Carlo Game Keeper.
LONDON, Feb. 6.â A striking exam
ple of the superstition of gamblers in
regard to luck occurred at what Is
known as the "suicides' table" at the
Casino at Monte Carlo last week.
A ,fly alighted on No. 13 after the
players, had been suffering from a per
sistent run of bad luck. In a moment
the middle dozen was liberally backed.
Then an elderly gambler piled napo
leons around 13, the less confident stak
ing their money on transversals.
Then the marble spun. The- croupier
announced that the winning number
was 13. Furthermore, 13 came three
times in succession and the fly cost the
Casino Â£5000.
It is reported that about 600 of the
immigrants landed in New York during
the last six months have become public
charges.

BERLIN, Feb. 6. â The Reichstag
to-day passed the bill prolonging for

generally predicted before the last
election that the Government would
attempt to carry a bill this winter in
creasing the number of troops under

status of the empire prevented it. It
is now believed the Government
merely postponed the execution of the
plan until the next session of the
Reichstag.

tCbjqrrtcbt. 19C4. by Joseph B. BowlÂ«Â«.)
I t% ill describe the customs of the na
tives as 1 found them, and if any of
my descriptions differ in some points
from those of other travelers It will be
beca.*iiEP ivt? have seen variations of the i
EmnÂ» general customs.
I religious customs are rather vague,
for tho rood reason that there Is very
lit tie religion. The mingonga, or medi
cine man. is virtually the priest of the
tribe. 1 thought at first that he was
p.n ur.rr: iterated fraud, and so he some
times is, bat he Is also an institution
and plays no unimportant part In se
rtirinj^ the observance of the laws and
traditions of his tribe. There is more
method in his madness than at first
sijrht arrears, and many of his absurd
looking ceremonies may be founded on
reasons that we do not know. One
thing about the niedicine man is certain
â h*Â» knows how to keep a well-stocked
larder. The best of the fish and game
*>re given to appease the angry spirits,
and he knows where they go.
I recall an amusing instance In which
the racket of the medicine nfan was
Â» orked to good purpose. One evening I
had given my men a goat for supper.
Pule^. my trusted man. was the son of
the mingonga of his tribe, and there
f<:e knew the ropes. He saw that there
was not enough goat for them all, so he
suggested that as they were far from
h"me the N'Yamma of N'Zoppa might
imagine he was forgotten by them and
!Â»e angry unless they showed him the
pleasant attention of a goat supper.
Now the N'Yamma is a great beast,
who does all the dirty work for N'Zop
l>a. such as killing men. tipping their
canoes, making mortal man's life mis
erable for him. In the water he is called
N'Gondera. and swims like a crocodile.
When on land men call him the N'Fa
tnutu. but wherever he may be the na
tives always feed him. The supper was
prepared in great solemnity. Dulee and
his little brother, Wassy, were selected
to feed it to the N'Yamma. I watched
with interest. At about 10 o'clock that
night I heard a peculiar noise in the
liush. I called Dulee to me. He was
s.V. excitement and spoke in a whisper.
I asked him what that noise meant, and
he answered it was the N'Yamma of
N'Zoppa eating the goat. All the time
the Queer noise was going on in the
dark bush. It sounded like some one
talking through his nose. I went out to
i he men and looked them over; they
were trembling and excited, but Wassy
v as gone. Upon asking where he was
they reiflied that he was at the chief's
lo get water.
I seized my revolver and 1 went Into
the bush after the N'Yamma. remark
ir.q; I was tired of furnishing suppers
for him and meant to kill him. Before
I made ten steps Dulee had caught me
n?;d was holding me back. What was
I coins to do? The N'Yamma would
kill me. He fairly prayed me not to
po. What an actor Dulee would make!
But I must kill the N'Yamma. I could
play the part of an actor too. In my
pretended excitement I cocked my re
volver and dragged Dulee forward
rearer the beast. Fearing I would
vhoot and knowing that the N'Yamma
v. as Wessy, Dulee confessed. Wassy
v .is there, and not after water. I said
eo more, but v.ent to my bed.
In the morning I asked Dulee if the
NTamma liked his dinner. Tes, !t was
a:; gone. They had taken it to him in
a covered pot, the cover tied on with
n_<2shlngai to keep out dogs, monkeys
.-Â»&d any wild animal that might be
rru.vlinff about NTamma had eaten
ihÂ«> meat without taking off the lid.
Then I accused Dulee of eating it. For
a long time he stuck to his story, but
at last owned up and explained how
Y.'assy made the noise by putting two
fingers in his nostrils and then talking.
Dulee begged me not to tell the other
men, as it was a professional secret
v.hich they had learned from thslr
father, and the men would be angry if
they knew how they had been tricked.
Funeral customs vary somewhat in
different parts of Africa, but most of
the variations can be traced to the
operation of foreign influences. Near
BraEsaville, where cannibalism has
b.-cn long a thing of the past, they
embalm their dead by wrapping them
in native cloth, using abundance of
cam wood to paint the body red, and
placing it betv/een each layer of cloth,
sifter which the body is left to smoke
over a slow fire until tne first rain.
During the dry season it may smoke
T^r months. After this process it looks
lltte an Egyptian mummy. I believe the
natives sot this custom from the Egyp
tians* or perhaps the Egyptians got ;.t
from them. They put the body In a
Earcophagus-!ooking box. cut from the
trunk of a tree, but the white ants
have nothing of a mummy or box In a
few months after Interment. The death
of a chiefâ provided he is a great chief
âis always kept secret as long as pos
sible, or until after the crown prince
!Â»as been fairly Installed; this usually
takes place the eame day.
When a big chief is burled.accord
ing to anrie>nt rites his, favorite wives,
â¢slaves and even his edvisers are placed
i:i the grave with him. I arrived at
Bosagee rapids a few days after Ban
ga. chief of the Dondys. had been
juried with great pomp and cere
mony. Fourteen of his favorite wives
and twenty slaves were buried with
him. These wives had volunteered to
die, and according to custom they
were painted red with cam wood, just
as they were when married. Each
sat in turn on the burial logs, when
a half-inch rope was wound once
around, her neck and a strong man
pulled at each end of this rope and
slowly strangled her, the mother or
sister of the woman holding her hand
over her mouth. It is not a hard
death, they eay, as the victim almost
invariably faints a few seconds after
respiration is cut off. The wives were
buried in tiers of six, each tier cross
ways of the one preceding, and lastly
the nude body of the chief, painted
red like the women, was placed face
downward across the last tier..
The tombs are carefully concealed
and no one except the closest relatives
knows their whereabouts. I â  have
worked diligently to discover one of
these sepulchers, but to no purpose.
The N'Sacklaws bury their dead by
digging a perpendicular hole, from
the bottom of which they run a" tun
nel horizontally from twenty to fifty
yards. In this tunnel the bodies are
laid, and as It may run In any direc
tion, a grave robber would have dif
ficulty in finding it. The Yaccomas
put earthen pots to eat out of in the
graves, also bows, arrows, spears and
other personal belongings. But the
common man has very little planted
in his grave. He goes through the
world with very little, and he has very
little to take out of it. When the
burial of a chief Is'comfortably over
the successor marries as many of the
remaining wives as he sees fit. The
ceremony takes place on tha family
log, where he sits with each woman in
turn while they paint one another red
with cam wood.
I tried to find out whether there was
any underlying principle in the prac
tice of tattooing or any general types
to which the practice conformed, but
I could find traces of neither. Each
chief makes his men mark his chil
dren in a particular way, and when a
chief dies the mark is sometimes
changed. There 'seems to be in the
custom a suggestion of the mark of
ownership. There is also the idea of
ornamentation, and the styles of tat
tooing change as xlo the fashions in
civilized countries.* It Is an evidence
of bravery, they think, to see deep cuts
and large self-imposed scars. Some
tribes tattoo to a great extent; others
scarcely any. Slaves are detected by
a hole in each nostril; freemen have
other tattoo markings, according to
tribal customs. The African uses no
ink; the marking is_ made by scars
cut time and again in the same place,
until the scar becomes embossed in
extreme cases a quarter of an inch.
Many of the designs look well on the
African skin.
Almost all African tribes pull out the
eyebrows; some take out all the hair
on the face. But the greatest slaves
to style are the tribes who distort the
lobes of the ears until they look like
the handles <ra a water pitcher. Others
distort the nose and ,lips with conical
wedges to such an extent as to im
pede enunciation, thus changing the en
tire language. Sometimes a tribe will
file and cut the front teeth to sharp
points, giving a most savage appear
ance. Another will pull out the two
upper front teeth in infancy.
Ordeal by fire by holding red-hot iron
in the hands is said to be practiced in
the Congo. I have never met with it,
but ordeal by poison is common all over
the Congo. The poison used Is \ the
same throughout the whole of Western
Africa. It is made from the root of
the nkasa tree, which is found only in
spots, one of the places where It is
abundant being an island above Koan
go. The bark of the root is scraped
off with a knife and placed In water.
After standing a short time the water
turns red from the color of the bark.
There is a yellow bark as well, and
some tribes prefer the one and some
the other. The liquid is then given to
the accused party.
The poison is given in different ways
among different tribes. In some tribes
when any one is accused of witchcraft,
adultery or theft, in order .to find out
whether or not he is guilty, the poison
is first of all given to a chicken. If
the chicken dies the accused must sub
mit to the poison test; if the chicken
lives he .is â¢ acquitted. Once when near
the village of By-Barri I was told that
the chief of the Yaccomas was about to
administer the poison, in order to find
out which of the two women who had
been suspected of witchcraft was re
sponsible for his swollen foot. I ran
to the village as fast as my legs could
carry me. but before I got there the
poison had been given. I found a large
crowd of people gathered; together.
They were in the form of a circle, their
attention centered upon two women,
who were jumping about in wild ex
citement. In about ten minutes one
of them began to vomit, and soon re
covered. The other was thrown into
convulsions, and lay prone upon the
ground until death ended her agony.
The medicine man was going through
a lot of mumbo Jumbo, and through it
all I could hear him asserting that the
poison never failed to find out the
guilty. The woman who vomited up
the poison was received back by her
friends with great rejoicing. The
relatives of the dead woman were the
loudest in heaping maledictions on her
name. It was evident that all the
people had the most implicit faith in
the accuracy of the test. But Justice
surely miscarries In those cases where
the medicine man has been bribed to
give a mild dose, or where too large a
d..Fe has been given. In slight offenses,
such as theft, if the party who had
been wronged was willing, an antidote
may be given.
The Pope and His Cap.
Another story of the new Pope's sim
ple habits and ways is told by a Rome
paper. An aristocratic lady, was re
ceived in audience recently by his Holi
ness. Encouraged by his affability, his
visitor offered him as a small ; present
a little calotte or cap which .she had
made in silk with her own hands. On
his acceptance of her gift the lady
asked if Plus X would. not give her as
a memento of her visit the one he was
then wearing. Taking off a very plain,
coarse. cap from his head his Holiness
said: "When you bring me : one Just
like this we will make the exchange."

THE BALKAN OUTLOOK.
FOR some time past comparatively little public at
tention has been given to the progress of affairs in
the Balkans. It seems to have been forgotten that
at this time last year the portents of war were far more
threatening there than in Manchuria.' Diplomatists
were kept busy night and day trying to maintain peace
through the concert of Europe, while in Austria and in
Turkey troops were mobilized and held in readiness for
immediate action should it be necessary. The crisis,
however, was passed without an outbreak, and of late
events in Manchuria have been of such a nature as to
absorb attention, so that for a time Macedonia and her
troubles have been well nigh forgotten.
The shifting of interest from southeastern Europe to
northeastern Asia has been due wholly to the increas
ing strain upon the relations between Japan and Russia;
and not to any diminution in the critical nature of the
situation in the Balkans. As a matter of fact the danger
of war in that part of the world is fully as threatening
now as it was a year ago, when everybody was looking
for an uprising in the spring? The powers that direct
the concert of Europe repressed the discontents of the
Balkan people last year, but did not remove the caases
of them, and as a consequence the elements of strife
exist there as full of potency as ever. It is even proba-'
ble that a conflict between Russia and Japan might lead
to war in the Balkans, by removing from the hostile
races the strong hands of the powers that have hitherto
kept them in order.
A recent report from Constantinople, after reviewing
the delay of the Turk in instituting promised reforms,
and the increasing dissatisfaction of the Christian pop
ulation of the empire, says:
"The reluctance of the Turks to act arises, no doubt,
from their dislike to the whole of the project imposed
by Europe, but it is largely increased from their hopes of
a struggle between Russia and Japan. If this should
take place it would indeed be teVrible news for the
Christian population of the Balkans. Probably all pre
tense of intention to carry out the reforms would be
thrown aside. The Turkish newspapers give ample evi
dence of the intense interest which the Turks take in the
question between Russia and Japan. Usually the space
devoted to foreign news is very small. For weeks past,
however, the Turkish papers are so crowded with state
ments on the Japanese question as to leave the impres
sion that French, Russian and English journals are care
fully examined and extracts given from all which can
afford any indication of what is likely to happen in the
Far East.
From that and from similar statements coming from
Constantinople or from Vienna, it is evident that a war
in Manchuria would dangerously increase the chances of
war in the Balkans. In the passage quoted, we are given
the Macedonian view of the situation, but other writers,
who are studying the crisis on the spot, declare that an
outbreak of war in Manchuria would be followed by an
immediate uprising in Macedonia, no matter what the
Sultan's .government may do or leave undone. Indeed
the whole Balkan peninsula is in a state of unstable
equilibrium. The present status is maintained solely by
the concert of Europe, and should the' concert be broken
up or even weakened by a war of first-class magnitude,
the chances are that nearly the whole of the Turkish
dominions in Europe would be involved in confusion,
leading to a war not less portentous than that between
Russia and Japan. >
When the worthy guardians of the peace and property
of the people of Oroville inspected a set of burglar-proof
cells, which the town had been at considerable expense
to obtain, the startling fact was discovered the other
day that the bars could be cut in twain by an ordinary
saw. Yet no burglar had escaped. Let us hope that if
we must be afflicted by burglars it will' be by the rustic
Oroville brand.
CHILD LABOR.
rnp^HE age at which the law will permit a child to do
I any gainful work is an issue in many States. The
â *â  evil of toil, especially indoors, by children, affects
not the victims alone, but is passed on to future genera
tions. No nation, wise in the things that concern its
welfare and permanence, can afford to permit the phy
sical deterioration of its people.
But the question has many sides and many difficulties,
and a hard and fast rule will do good in some ways and
harm in others. It is under discussion in^New Jersey be
tween the Governor and representatives of the Feder
ated Trades, who put the limit at 13 years of age. The
Governor sought to amend the law so that the son of a
widow, under that limit, needing his help, might be per
mitted to earn and aid in his and her support. To this it
was answered that such a widow and her children should
be supported as paupers by the public. This raises an
other question of importance to society. Is it well to
start children in the world with the blight of pauperism
upon them? If such children can, by labor that is not es
sentially injurious to them, aid in supporting themselves
and their mother, saving- her the humiliation and them
selves the injury of pauperism, is it wise and well to for
bid it?
Of course there is present the difficulty of choosing an
occupation for them that is fitting. But in the myriad
activities required^by our many industries there should
be such places for this class of children.
The physical and moral superiority of children reared
in the country on farms is often noted. It would be well
if the Jrend of our population to cities were turned back
to the country. On a farm there is non-injurious occu
pation for children, from the beginning of their physical
activity. In the tending of fowls, light work in the gar
den, attending to s the fire wood, doing chores, helping in
the kitchen, picking fruit, and scores of other ways, the
boys and girls on a farm get a knowledge of nature
learn useful employment of their time and acquire habits
of industry which lead them on to independence. The
country school is in. many ways superior to the city
school, as a means of acquiring the book knowledge
which is the foundation of all education.: -
Secretary Hay, in his oration at the memorial exer
cises in Congress, in honor of the memory of- President
McKinley, sketched in charming phrase such a life, wh'cn
he said of McKihlry: "He belonged to'a generation of
boys who were unconscious of any superior and of any
inferior. They knew no want their \vn labor could not
satisfy, and they; learned the lessons of patriotism and
acquired a taste for letters in the^cxcellcnt school read
ers, of that day, "which often constituted the family li
brary." ~ . . V;
The stubborn . tendency â  of ; our ; large foreign immigra
tion to huddle together in cities, with large families, is
increasing the complexity of the child problem in those
dense populations. This immigration consists too much
of a non-rural population. Foreign conditions separate
people too much from the soil, and throw them in the
major and minor trades and into unskilled labor v that is
employed in cities. They bring with them no experi
ence in rural life and no taste f of its occupations. The
sense of isolation from the place of their nativity impels
them to herd together, so that they may socially asso
ciate with those who speak their language.
If* they were separated they would be compelled to
learn English, and that knowledge would put them in
touch. with our institutions. For lack of it they learn but
little of the country or its people and adhere, for genera
tions, to the manners and customs, the habits and the
institutions of the lands whence they came. If their
tastes were rural and they' would take land as renters
even, they would live better and would receive the in
expressible benefit of assimilation. But they congest in
cities, where their presence hardens the problem of life
for themselves and those among whom they seek an
asylum. Child labor and training is one of the issues
that they at once precipitate upon us. A resort to rural
life Is part of its solution.
In an acrimonious debate in the House of Representa
tives recently the criminal and political records of Indi
ana and Kentucky respectively were the subjects of
heated discussion. As was to be expected the affairs of
Kentucky are so criminally political and politically crim
inal that the Indianans might have talked for a week
and still have left their subject with mines of reminiscent
information yet to explore.
CHINESE FINANCE. ,
MR. CONANT. a financial expert, representing
this Government, is abroad engaged in the task
of getting an agreement of the nations in re
ceipt of indemnity from China, incident to the Boxer
war, to take the same in silver, provided that China
agrees to use what she will save by such an arrange
ment In adopting the gold standard and securing for
herself the use of stable money. It is understood that
the nations concerned have all agreed except Italy,
and Mr. Conant is in Rome negotiating with that Gov
ernment.
If this arrangement is made, it will furnish a con
spicuous ease of great good coming out of evil. It has
come to be admitted as a fact in economics that no coun
try can progress nor its people rise into prosperity and
go forward in civilization unless^ they have a stable
money on the foundation of a sure standard. China
has had a most difficult money system, with the tael
as a unit, and the taels differing in value according to
the towns or the provinces where they are the medium
of exchange. The people handle only the brass "cash,"
of insignificant intrinsic value, while in larger trans
actions the Mexican dollar is the currency of commerce.
China's financial system has held her back and kept her
people on a low scale of life. She needs a stable cur
rency/ whose units are of equal -and common value in
all parts of the empire, which will facilitate her domestic
and -foreign commerce.
It is estimated that she can secure this by using what
she will save by payment of the foreign indemnities in
silver. That the indemnified nations consent to this
shows the great advance made by the world since our
gold campaign of 1896. They seek commerce in China.
They desire to promote there an expansion of the wants
of the people, . which can come only by raising their
standard of life. And they recognize that the beginning
of all this is in an efficient financial reform.
The proposition accomplished will do more for China
than all the armies and all the missionaries that could
be sent to her. It will give her strength to retain
autonomy and resist dismemberment. It will end the
excuse of other Governments for > possessing her terri
tory in order to do this very thing, which she will have
the power to do for herself.
After what appears to be a great deal of unnecessary
delay and an unseemly display of official hesitation we
have won for San Francisco out of the Iroquois horror
of Chicago one sad benefit. It is now settled in the
opinion of our authorities that several of our theaters
are veritable death traps in the event of fire or panic
It will be interesting to note how long it takes to sug
gest, and make effective a remedy.
FEED THE BRUTE.
A CLUB lady in Chicago, in a meeting of matrons
to discuss the great issues of life, when asked how
to manage a husband so as to secure domestic
tranquillity, promptly answered, "Feed the brute plenty
of good well-cooked food," and the club ladies all made
a note of it, and it is believed the experiment is now on
extensive trial in the windy city.
This recipe for domestic happiness suggests a menag
erie view of married life, and may, furnish a reason for
the tendency to board rather than keep house, that is so
strong upon many married people. In this view it
is complimentary to the sense of justice of the brute. For
what dyspepsia he gets at a boarding-house table he does
not blame his wife, but the landlady. She cares nothing
for the growling of the animals at feeding time, pro
vided they don't die in the house and will be buried from
the undertaker's melancholy parlors.
This new plan for peace foreshadows also the perma
nent! disarming of the domestic forces, since young ladies
about to assume the task of marrying one of the brutes
will be impelled to acquire a knowledge of the mysteries
of cooking in order to live happy ever after. When this
art is generally attained the. boarding-house landladies
will be overtaken by lack of trade and will be punished
for .their many transgressions. So a beautiful vista
opens in front of the American home and the dove is
likely to build her nest in the stomach of thatjbrute, the
American husband. _
A railway train was wrecked -in Colorado a few days
since by a terrific gale.- In these little affairs the elements
should not disturb themselves. If there "is anything on

and a success long past the degree of most alarming de
sire it is in wrecking railroad trains. We need no con
tributory violence from nature.
The startling discovery has been made that certain

enough to excite the highest hope of a great and valu
able field. This should create neither surprise nor en
thusiasm. ;: If there is anything on earth worth having

TALK OF THE TOWN
AND TOPICS OF THE
TIMES
Nemesis,
A group of well-dressed, prosperous
appearing men was standing at the cor
ner of Third and Kearny streets a few
days ago. 'The tallest of the t group
seemed to be in particularly good spir
its, and his companions evidently found
him congenial company, for they laugh
ed uproariously several times at his
remarks. Just as the group was about
to break up a crowd gathered across
the street. The gathering was explain
ed by a passer-by, who volunteered the
information that a woman had fallen
off a car and was badly hurt.
"Oh," said the tall man in a care
less and even contemptuous manner,
"I suppose she was drunk." Then he
turned to his companions, and, with a
laugh and a parting; Joke, bade them
erood-by.
When he arrived at his office In a
near-by sky-scraper he noticed that
everything seemed to be In confusion.
He demanded to know the cause of the
turmoil, but no one seemed anxious to
tell him until finally his stenographer,*
with tears in her eyes, called him Into
the inner office and said:
"Your mother Is badly hurt. She Just
fell off a car at the corner. You are
wanted at the hospital."

ARTHUR KETCHUM, in the February
Atlantic
Napoleon's Spies.
The recently discovered memoirs of
a certain Captain d'Aubigney of Mar
shal Soult's army relates an Interesting
anecdote of the times of the great Na
poleon.
During the reign of Emperor Napo
leon I at a dinner In Paris the conver
sation turned upon the Emperor and
his Government, according to the
story. One of the company remarked
that he was a great man, but was too
fond of war. When the party broke
up a gentleman who waa present re
quested to speak In private to the per
son who had made that observation.
"Sir," said he, "I am sorry for it. but
I must request you to go with me to
the police." "Why?" said the other,
in the greatest apparent alarm. "I
have said nothing against the Em
peror but what every one must
acknowledge â that he is too fond of
war. There can be no harm in that."
"With that I have nothing to do.
You must go with me to the police."
The other now began to show the
strongest symptoms of fear; he en
treated the police agent in the most pa
thetic language to have compassion on
him. The other, however, stood un
moved by all his solicitation, when sud
denly the man rose from his knees and
burst into a laugh, to the utter aston
ishment of the informer. "You think
you have caught me," said he. "You
are a spy of the police; so am I, and I
was put over you to see whether you
would do your duty."
Causes of Cynicism.
Cynicism is never a native quality
of the mind; it always has its birth In
some unhappy experience. The young
man finds that the girl who has gath
ered up for him all the harmony and
melody pt earth rings hollow at the
test; and he drops his lyrical language
arid becomes , cynical of women. The
citizen of Boston has naturally grown
cynical of newspapers. The candidate
for public office who has been definitely
retired to private life by being "knifed"
at the polls distrusts party politics. A
man publishes a novel and thenceforth
is cynical of the publishers of novels.
Yet these misfortunes have their salu
tary aspect. The disappointed lover,
generalizing bitterly upon the sex, is
not always implacable; a cooler judg
ment tempers and restores his passion,
gives it another object, and so guides
him to a safer, if less gusty and emo
tional, love. The citizen of Boston, the
betrayed candidate, the blighted young
novelist, ,all have for their condition,
even though they know it not, a valu
able compensation; for the very event
that has brought them to this pass of
reasonable cynicism has stirred their
indignation; yes, in spite of their seem
ing inertness, indignation is now
smoldering.â Arthur Stanwood Pier,
In the February Atlantic.
Rarities.
The appearance of a real whale any
where along the North Atlantic Coast
is an event these days. Like the buf
falo or bison of the Western plains the
whale is almost extinct. It Is no longer
profitable to send out ships, and the
result is that whalebone has practically
vanished. Many satisfactory substi
tutes for whale oil and whalebone have
recently been put on the market. An
other popular denizen of the sea which
Is no longer sought is the codfish. The
scarcity of cod liver oil. a great tonic
for persons with weak lungs, is owing
not to the fact that fewer codfish ars
caught, but that the fish have little or
no livers any more. This Is thought
to be caused by lack of sufficient nour
ishment, as the tiny sea creatures on
â which the cod feed are disappearing
from the Norwegian waters. The livers
of the fish, when caught, nre found ta
be shriveled badly and in some cases
totally lacking. Where formerly It took
only about fifteen thousand cod to
make a barrel of cod liver oil it now re
quires at least forty thousand.
'An ""American Duel"
A foreign paper relates that a tragic
affair, has Just happened In Hungary,
.where V young law student. , aged 23
years; named Koloman Misic, shot him
self, declaring that he was the victim
of the "American" duel. ' The unfortu
nate â¢ young man - and â¢ a - friend fell in
love a year ago with the same girl,
and the friend, feeling himself slighted,
spoke rudely of the girl, whereupon
Misic struck him In the face. Both tha
young men decided to have recourse to
the "American" duel, when a white and
black ball are placed in a bag and
drawn for. Mlslo was unlucky enough
to draw the fatal black ball, which eia
nifled his death within a year. A few
days before this date fell due he re
ceived a letter from his adversary
warning him of the approaching date.
Punctually on the appointed day he
took leave of his friends and relatives
and took a Journey td a place called
Neutra, where his own father had pre
viously committed suicide. Thers he
shot himself.
Our own American conception of an
"American duel" does not agree with
this romantic scheme of self-destmo

Queer Legal Sentences.
The courts In two States have at
tempted to answer a question that has
been perplexing the jurists and patriots
â namely, what can be done to re
lieve the judicial system of the stigma
put upon it by the inadequacy of pun
isments in the case of crime? The first
case is presented by a court In Texas,
where a Judge cannot impose a death
sentence. Allen Brown, a negro con
victed of attempted assault, has been
sentenced in the District Court of
Cherokee County to 1000 years In the
penitentiary. If his time is reduced
two months a year for good behavior
Brown will be a free man in A. D. 2738.
California furnishes the other in
stance. John H. Wood, leader of the
convicts who escaped from the Folsom
penitentiary last summer, and who
was convicted of murder In the second
degree. Judge Hart did not impose
another punishment, but ordered the
prisoner to appear one hundred years
from that date and receive sentence. In
both cases the Judges felt that the
emergency called for something excep
tional, and they did the best their lim
ited knowledge of the law indicated as
suitable. â New York Herald.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 7, 3904.
MRS. MAYBRICK
STILL CAPTIVE
As an Inmate of the Home of
the Sisters of the Epiphany
She Is Jealously Guarded
IDENTITY IS HIDDEN
Woman Will Be Kept in Seclu
sion With Abridged Privi
leges Until Release in July
LONDON, Feb. 6. â Mrs. Maybrick is
serving out the last few month3 of her
life sentence for the killing of her hus
band in the quiet country home of the
Sisters of the Epiphany at Truro,
Cornwall, under an assumed name and
with her identity completely hidden.
She is guarded from communication
with the outside world as jealously as
if she were still in Aylesbury prison.
Though the fresh Cornwall air is
bringing the color back to her cheeks,
the strain of her fourteen years of
confinement, commencing with the .im
position of the death sentence, passed
under the severe discipline of various
prisons, is still evident in her care
worn look. She takes her meal3 in
silence and is not allowed to converse
except on religious topics during the
day. At tea time, when for an in
terval the sisters are permitted to talk
of mundane things, Mrs. Maybrick re
tires to her own room. She must be in
bed by 9 o'clock. No newspapers are
allowed her and only such books as
are given her by the sisters. She will
remain in charge of the sisters until
she Is released next July, though be
fore that time, when the weather im
proves, she will be removed probably
to the convalescent home under the
same management, which is located in
one of the wildest spots on the Cornish
coast.
In her present sanctuary Mrs. May
brick appears to be happy by com
parison. Many members of the Eng
lish aristocracy are inmates of the
home and hence Mrs. Maybrick's ar
rival caused no corrfment. She was
driven from the Truro railroad sta
tion to the home in Miss Dalrymple's
private carriage and remained in
strict incognito for nearly a fortnight.
The acting mother superior is one of
the few who know of the identity of
the visitor and she guards her from
all interviews with a vigilance worthy
an old time abbess. ' This sister ab
solutely refused to convey a letter or
a message to Mrs. Maybrlck from a
representative of the Associated
Press. A rescue home for fallen girls
and a laundry, foi- their employment
is carried on in connection with the
Epiphany convent.
Mrs. Maybrick's somewhat anoma
lous Btatus was explained as follows
to the Associated Press representa
tive by one of the chief officials of the
Epiphany order:
"Mrs. Maybrick is still a- prisoner
and has not even been released on
ticket of leave. Those in charge of
her are practically her jailers and all
communication with her is forbidden
except through the Home Secretary."
These appear to be the official in
structions which accompanied .Mrs.
Maybrlck on her departure from the
Aylesbury prison. No prison warden
Is with Mrs. Maybrick, the sisters be
ing implicitly entrusted with her safe
keeping, which fact is generally re
garded as constituting an unprece
dented indulgence to a prisoner.
The Baroness de Roques will, it is
expected, come to Truro later on, that
she may be near her daughter.
SENT INSPECTOR TO SEE
TEXAS POSTMISTRESS
Assistant P. M. General Brlslow Won
dcring Whether He Will Get Re
port 6r Rend of Funeral.
Fourth Assistant Postmaster General
Bristow received information recently
from the Sheriff in a little town in
Texas which caused him immediately
to order a postofflce inspector to visit
the place and investigate conditions In
the postofflce there. Mr. Bristow isn't
exactly sure whether he Is goine to
hear from the inspector or read an ac
count in some newspaper of his ob
sequies. He is hoping for the best,
however.
According to the Sheriff's letter, the
citizens of the little Texas town would
like to have the Postmistress "toned
down." He explains that the presid
ing genius of the office has undertaken
to improve the manners of the resi
dents of the town, which he admits
are somewhat ragged from disuse. But
the means adopted to attain this praise
worthy end are considered rather harsh.
The Postmistress will not permit any
citizen of the town to enter the office
with his hat on, and when the Mayor,
or the Sheriff, or some more humble
resident is a' trifle forgetful and strolls
up to the counter with his head cov
ered the Postmistress enforces her de
sire with a brace of Colt's 45s.
"We don't set up any claim that our
mannersÂ»Â«are all they should be," says
the Sheriff, "but we'*! like to be reas
oned with and helped along. The Post
mistress here Is a worthy woman, all
right, and there ain't a thing against
her character, but she certainly is rude
and hasty.
"There's another thing we don't think
Is fair. The Postmistress â  won't let
niggers and greasers come In the office
under any consideration. We ain't over
fond of niggers and greasers ourselves,
but it is sure discommoding for the
leading citizens to have to go to the
postoffice personally to get the mail
Just because this lady don't like to see
anything but a gentleman."
Mr. Bristow thought the case de
served consideration and dispatched an
Inspector to the scene.â Washington

Disaffection in the Dutch Army.
A soldier in the garrison of Amster
dam recently refused to return to arms
owing to cosclentious scruples, and was
condemned bv the Haarlem court-mar
tial to three months' imprisonment.
The incident has aroused much indig
nation among anti-militarists. Com-'
mittees were formed in different towns
to defend the soldier's interests, and
pamphlets were scattered broadcast
throughout the country upholding his
attitude.
The episode has attracted much at
tention in , the' press, and it has been
proposed as a solution to transfer the
soldier in question to the infirmary de

History of Abyssinia.
Abyssinia, an African empire
known to the ancients as Ethiopia, Is
rapidly rising in importance, indus
trially and commercially. It Is situ
ated In the eastern part of Africa, and
is presided over by an emperor with
the title, "Negus Negusti," which sig
nifies "king of kings." The present
ruler is Menelik II. born In 1842, a
man of rather remarkable character
and singular clear-headedness for one
so far separated from the outside in
fluence of the civilized world. After a
long and eventful career, Menelik suc
ceeded in securing the independence
of his country by a 'treaty signed at
Adis-Abeba, August 26, 1896. Up to
the present time the different states
and provinces of Abyssinia are ruled
over in a manner almost feudal by
governors, called rases. Each ras has
his own military force. The total army
of the empire amounts to 150.0QQ men,
all of-^'-whom *are supposed to be
mounted .and armed with rifles ob
tained from the Italians or imported
in recent years from other countries.

GIVE YOUR STOMACH
A NICE VACATION*
Don't Do It by Starving It Either.
Let a Substitute Dd the Work.
The old adage, "All work and no
play makes Jack a dull boy," applies
Just as well to the stomach, one of the
most important organs of the human
system, as it does to the man himself.
If your stomach is worn out and
rebels against being further taxed be-
yond its limit, the only sensible thing
you can do is to give it a rest. Em-
ploy a substitute for a short time and
see if it will not more than repay you
in results.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are a
willing and most efficient substitute.
They themselves digest every bit of
food in the stomach in Just the same
way that the stomach itself would .
were it well. They contain all the es-
sential elements that the gastric juice
and other digestive fluids of the
stomach contain and actually act Just
the same and do Just the same work as
the natural fluids would do, were the
stomach well and sound. They there-
fore relieve the stomach, just as one
workman relieves another, and permit
It to rest and recuperate and regain its
normal health and strength.
This "vacation" idea was suggested
by the letter of a prominent lawyer in
Chicago. Read what he says: "I was
engaged in the most momentous un-
dertaking of my life in bringing about
the coalition of certain great interests
that meant much to me as well as my
clients. It was not the work of days,
but of months; I was working night
and day almost, when at a very critical
time my stomach "went clear back on
me. The undue mental strain brought
it- about and hurried up what would
have happened later oni
"What I ate I had to literally force
down and that was a source of misery,
aÂ» I had a sour stomach much of the
time. My head ached, I was sluggish
and began to lose my ambition to
carry out my undertaking. It looked
! pretty gloomy for me and I confided
my plight to one of my clients. He
had been cured, by. Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets and at once went down to a
drug store and brought a box up to
the office.
"I had not taken a quarter of that
box before I found that they would do
all, the work my stomach ever did;
and as a rest or vacation was out of
the question for me, I determined to
give my stomach a vacation. I kept
right on taking the tablets and braced
ui> and went ahead with my work with
renewed visor, ate just as much as I
ever did and carried out that under-
taking, to a successful issue. I feel
that I have Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets
to thank for saying me the handsomest
fee I ever received, as well as my repu-
tation, and, last but not least, my
stomach." -
, Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are for
sale by all druggists at 50 cents a box.

Montana 3Ian. Makes Discovery
of Ancient Engineering Work
Near the Great Slave Lake
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BOZBMAN, Mont., Feb. 6. â An
nouncement has been made here to
day of the discovery of extensive pre
historic engineering work in British
North America. The discovery was
made by Alexander S. Christie Sr., a
well-known civil engineer of this city,
who now is engaged In writing an ex
tensive article on the work. The relics
were found near McLeods Bay at the
northeastern end of the Great Slave
Lake.
\ The work is excavated in a solid
rock formation and it is covered sys
tematically with rock-cut inscriptions,
in great part still legible. Christie
made a partial exploration and
brought away copies of a large body of
inscriptions and a record of forty-six
measurements. He since has suc
ceeded in establishing the fact that
the inscriptions purely are alphabetic
and in several Instances has solved
their meaning. He expects soon to re
turn and remain a year or more.
The Cliarm of Neatness.
There is an exquisite charm about a
neatly dressed woman. She does not
wear her hair twisted up carelessly,
as If just about to fall over her shoul
ders. Her gloves are not ripped at
the seams, nor are any buttons miss
ing from her boots. Her veil does not
reveal a hole over her chin, nor does
the binding, of her skirt show ragged
in places.
Not many women show, their tidi
ness in all these little details, but it is
a pleasure to meet the girl or woman
who ls/to. use a slang term, "well
groomed." The cloth gown of such a
woman fit* her without a -crease, and
there is neither speck nor spot on it.
Her linen collar and cuffs are snowy
white and remain properly fixed in
their places. Her gloves do not
Avrinkle, but button smoothly over her
wrists. Her shoes are kept clean and
polished. Her bonnet or hat is pinned
on straight and her hair is neatness it
self. She is the picture of delicate
finish and wholesome order. Would
that we 'could come across her some
what oftener! â Washington Star.
Orders have recently been executed In

Best Government.
Birmingham has been able to boast
of being the best governed city In the
kingdom ever since the days when Jo
seph Chamberlain was confining his en
ergies to municipal management. But
now the vexed question of liquor li
censes has brought a reaction against
the reform movement For nearly a
decade Arthur Chamberlain has been
deputy chairman of the magisterial
bench, and therefore, according to cus
tom,, the chairman of the licensing
committee. During a large portion of
that time he has been working for
the suppression of unnecessary licenses
and against the principle of regarding
an annual license as a perpetual per
mission to traffic in liquor. The whole
forces of trade have been gathered to
carry Mr. Chamberlain's position; and
during his absence from England In
search of health he has been turned out
of his deputy chairmanship by a two
thirds majority of his colleagues.
Colombia has had seven constitutions,
and the title of the republic has been

Lieutenant General Chaffee. When the
Apaches were on the warpath years
ago he was a captain of the Sixth Cav

round up a lot of the Indians he called
at the post telegraph office.
"Have you any further orders for
me?" he asked.
"No, sir," the operator replied. "Ths
wires are not working very well to
day."
"I am not surprised." said Chaffee. as
he turned to order his advance; "I had
them cut early this morning. I don't

AGED PRIEST ACCUSES
DR. THOMAS BRENNAN
Father Grey, Lying on Sick Bed, Tells Police Judge
Fritz That the Physician Took $37,000 Belong
ing to Himâ Defendant Is Released on Bail
Dr. Thomas F. Brennan was before
Judge Fritz yesterday on a charge of
mulcting an aged Catholic priest, Rev.
Father P. J. Grey, out of $37,524 13.
Under the stress of illness he claims
to have confided to Brennan most of
his property interests, which con
sisted principally of a deposit of more
than $37,000, which the aged priest
had In the Hibernia Bank.
In order to obtain the real facts
Judge Fritz held court in Father
Grey's room yesterday afternoon and
heard the story 'of 'the priest. Age had
dulled his memory of the tran
sactions within the last few years, but
he was thoroughly clear on the char
ity he said he had extended to Bren
nan during the years of the physician's
early struggles. For such efforts, he
said, he expected better returns , iri
gratitude. Brennan, he said, had
conducted the priest's private business
in many ways. When the priest was
asked to sign a paper by Brennan he
did so, he claims, .without distrust and
sometimes without knowing its con
tents. Last September he learned
that four checks, which he claims he
signed without knowledge of their
purport, were presented' to the'Hiber
nia Bank, withdrawing all the funds
he had there. I
The bank officials have been sub
penaed and will be witnesses in the
case. - , . -
Brennan is out on bail of $5000,
which was fixed by Judge Cabaniss
after Judge Fritz had placed his se
curity at $5Q,000 cash, or $100,000
bonds.

Niccolo Postine, who was ordered
into custody for perjury by Judge
Conlan because he told such evident
untruths in the preliminary hearing
of Giovanni Rossi and Francisco Fos
sa, charged with the murder of Vin
censo Lavaginino, was released by
Judge Mogan yesterday. Judge Con
lan refused to affix his signature to a
complaint against the accused man
'and the District Attorney took no in
terest in the matter, so that prosecu
tion was hopeless. Under such' treat
ment perjury in police courts will be
come a popular pastime. â¢
John Lundgrin, the original man
from Missouri, who tempted the "top
and bottom game" and was ordered
into custody by Judge .Fritz for fear
that he would be dispersed in squads
at 'the temptations offered by his rob
bers, was given his liberty yesterday.
He told the Judge, under a strict
cross-fire of questions, that one of the*
alleged bunko men, "Con" Sullivan -by
name, whose record runs through
many a stone-flagged trail, with clink-
Ing steel to maintain it, made over
tures to reimburse him if he would
dip Into countries previously unknown
to him. â  "':
Lundgrin - claims that he refused all
overtures of settlement, and intended
to prosecute the case thoroughly. On
this statement and a further one that
he was . in the way of securing a job
in a wholesale house he was allowed
his liberty. Sullivan, who is at large
on $1000 bonds, was not in court to
listen to the proceedings.
John Hanson was convicted of dis
turbing the peace by Judge Mogan yes
terday. He was accused of throwing
two bottles of Barbary Coast booze
at J. H. Price, a streetcar conductor
who guides the destinies' of a car that
plows its muddy way to the Pacific
Mail dock. The charge should have
been assault with a deadly weapon, but
the Prosecuting Attorney overlooked
the chemical part of the missiles.
Theodore TVolters, known among
criminals as the "Identification Kid"
and as a strong right arm for Sergeant
Tim Bainbridge, who has charge S of
the excellent Bertillion bureau for the
identification of criminals maintained
by the Police Department of San
Francisco, was in trouble yesterday.
Sergeant Brainbridge rushed down
from Judge Cabaniss' court and in
formed Wolters that a brother of the
latter had been given sixty, days for
being drunk in a public place.
Theodore burled his face in his hands
and sobbed. "I had a brother once â
a gracious boy!" he exclaimed, N "but
I don't know what became of the
&uy v "
He hurried to the prison, and, peer
ing through the iron bars, found in
the confined man a likeness that
startled him. A moment's conversa
tion convinced him that the prisoner
was not kin to him in any way. He
wandered back to the identification bu
reau with his faith sadly shattered in
regard to facial resemblances.
James Bailey, the cocaine fiend who
made a failure of a "get-away" by
plumping into the sinewed arms of
Deputy Coroner Jim Murphy, was
given three months in the County Jail
yesterday by Judge Mogan. Bailey
broke away from a policeman who had
him under arrest and did a dipping and
veering act around the Morgue build
ing that would have compelled a sea
gull to become a chicken for shame of
lack of speed and agility. He was
caught on the fly by Murphy, and in
the struggle to curb Bailey's flight the
Deputy Coroner received, a badly
smoked lamp.
BOY ARRESTED FOR
ROBBING EMPLOYERS
Charles Kletz Accused of Having
Stolen Boxes of Spool Silk for
Four Months.
Charles Kletz.. a boy 17 years of
age, was arrested yesterday afternoon
by Detectives O'Dea and Mulcahy, and
locked up in "the tanks" at the City
Prison. A charge of grand larceny
will be preferred against him as soon
as the officers have concluded their
investigation.
The boy, whose parents live at 270
Clara street, entered the employment
of the Carlson-Currier | Company, silk
manufacturers, 8 Sutter street, about
four months^ ago. Soon afterward
the firm became* aware of the fact that
boxes of spool silk were being stolen,
but the thief could not be discovered.
Suspicion fell upon Kletz and he was
discharged last week.
The p_olice were' notified and O'Dea
and Mulcahy found that a number of
the stolen boxes had been sold to a
second-hand dealer on Folsom street.
From the description of the boy who
sold the goods the detectives arrested
Kletz and he was Identified by the
dealer. â¢ He admitted stealing the
boxes sold to the dealer, but no more.
The firm says that about 200 boxes
have been stolen, of the value of
$1400. The officers have recovered
about $600 worth so far. The boy
says he was alone in the thievery.
SWINDLER EWING GOES

Fifteen Months' Confinement and
to Pay a Fine.
William B. Ewing was sentenced by
United- States District Judge de Ha
ven yesterday, to be imprisoned for
fifteen months in the "penitentiary at
San Quentin and . to pay a fine of
$500. , He had been convicted of us
ing the - mails in the interest of the

many poor .women of their hard
earned, savings. In more than one
case it .was ; shown that he took the

. Ewing's wife and young daughter
were present in court when sentence
was pronounced and they and the
prisoner were very much affected.
The women whom he had Impover
ished had returned to their homes in
Sacramento and Los Angeles.
The prisoner had hoped that the
County Jail of San Francisco or Ala
meda would be selected as the place
for his imprisonment, but his offense
was too flagrant for judicial mercy. I

Former Vallejo Business Man
Applies for Divorce on the
Ground That Wife Is Cruel
SAYS SHE NEGLECTS HIM
Avers That She Once Humili
ated Him by Unseemly Con
duct With Men at Cliff House
Frank Bartles. recently of the firm
of Doty & Bartles of Vallejo, is the
plaintiSC in a 6ult for divorce filed yes
terday. The defendant is Mary Bar
tles. to whom he was married at
Etockton in 1892. He asks for a di
vorce on the gTound of cruelty and the
custody of their one child, a girl aped
10 years, -who, he claims, if allowed to
remain with her mother, trill be per
mitted to associate with persons whose
characters are not of the best.
According: to Bartles he has been a
x^ry miserable man for the last year
or two. He alleges that during that
time his wife neglected him, refused
to mend his clothes or prepare his
meals, and otherwise conducted her
eelf contrary to the rules governing a
pood and dutiful and loving: wife. She
even went so far, he says, as to leave
him alone when he was sick In bed,
intrusting to stray visitors the task of
administering: the medicines pre
scribed for him.
He says that on September 9 of last
year, while he was an inmate of the
French Hospital, she came to see him.
Instead of greeting: him kindly, as
should a loving wife, he alleges she
cursed him and told him she would
"fix him." She also, he says, cursed
his mother, who happened to be in his
room "when she arrived.
Eartles also claims that his wife is
responsible for his retirement from
the firm of Doty & Bartles. He says
that she deliberately slandered him to
his partner, Georg-e Doty, with the re
sult that Doty forced him out of the
business.
DISTURBED PARTY.
BartJes further complains that his
wife disturbed a little tamale party
he he!d at his home one night by or
dering his mother out of the house
and that one day while they were
enjoying themselves at the Cliff House
she made him appear ridiculous by her
conduct with strangers. He says she
sat upon the laps of several men,
drank with them and. notwithstand
ing his oresence. caressed them.
Josephine Heydenfeldt. a very pret
ty blonde with rosy cheeks and bright
blue eyes, made her debut In the di
vorce court before Judge Sloss yester
day. She was granted a divorce on
the ground of cruelty from Thor A.
Heydenfeldt. one of the famous Hey
denfeldt family. She testified that
Heydenfeldt, whose wife she became
at San Rafael in 1902, was a most
cruel husband, and that because of
his brutality she had to leave him.
She said he had a most violent tem
per and when things did not go to
suit him he would vent his anger upon
her. He cursed and swore at her with
great frequency, she said, and once,
when they were living in Oakland,
struck her. Her testimony was cor
roborated by that of Mrs. Hattie Trim
ble, the woman who introduced her to
Heydenfeldt.
Frank P. Purcell. who last July
was shot in a saloon row at Point
Richmond. Is being sued for divorce
by Eva L. Purcell. In her complaint
she charges that he is addicted to the
excessive use of intoxicants and that
she was frequently compelled to go
into saloons, where he spent most of
his time and money, and persuade him
to come home.
CHARGE DESERTION.
Jennie Mount Is seeking a divorce
Trom Thomas J. Mount on the ground
of desertion. She avers that he de

Winner Leads From Start to Finish, With Claude and
Oarsman Fighting It Out for Place.
Dull and foreboding overhead, the
course a sea of sloppy, slushy mud,
rain falling in big drops, it seemed the
fates had ordained that Burns handicap
day should again be a tempestuous one
as It was a year ago.
Suddenly there came a transforma
tion, for Just before the richest of all
the far western turf events was called,
the sun forced its way through the
dull, dreary cloud banks, throwing its
rays over the course like the brighten
ing effects of the glaring calcium lights
nn a Weber and Fields ballet. That
there was an immense crowd at Ingle
side yesterday goes without saying.
Some said ten thousand people were
there. That may bÂ© a liberal estimate,
but scarcely an exaggeration.
Of course, the inclemency of the
weathfrkept the drags and tally-hos
away, but the chug-chug of the auto
mobile was plainly audible from the
track garage. Rain never did improve
fine feathers and the fair sex looked
somber and severe clad in storm gar
ments.
MODICUM NEVER HEADED.
The big race is over, and once again
the floral horseshoe has been placed
over the head of an outsider. Modicum,
a 12 to 1 shot carrying 100 pounds and
ridden by Eugene Hildebrand, took the
bit between his teeth at the start and
left a flock of fifteen mudlarks behind
him squabbling for second and third
monsy. The long shot simply spread
eagled his company, winning in a gal
lop by three open lengths in 2:08 3-4.
Claude landed his 122 pounds In second
place under Johnny .Daly's skillful
piloting, 'a neck before Oarsman with
Wonderly up, the pair furnishing the
only, interesting duel of the race.
SAN FRANCISCO, SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 7, 1904.
Nothing but 111 luck appeared to
hover over the Jennings quartet, the
favorite in the betting. The delay at
the post did not add to the chances of
Proper, with his 127 pounds to begin
with. Arcade was badly bumped soon
after the start, NIgrette was outfooted
and Oliphant pulled Dainty up after
being pinched as the barrier was
sprung.
Now the winner will be grilled. He
will be called a poor, cheap selling
plater and his owner will be asked to
send him to the abattoir. To be sure
Modicum cannot be called a high-class
stake horse, for such he is not.
WINNER IS CALIFORNIA BRED.
On both fore feet are ring bones
that resemble anklets on the limbs of
an Ethiopian princess and he has lit
tle use for a hard track. Still Modi
cum can boast of a fairly aristocratic
lineage on both his sire's and dam's
side. He was bred at Rancho del
Paso and can always be considered a
dangerous factor over a muddy track.
Of the $10,000 purse $7000 went to
the first, $2000 to the second and $1000
to the third horse.
Dell Fountain was never accounted
a J. Waldere Kirk and is not a million
aire. But beneath the rough exterior
of the sturdy Idahoan beats a heart
that is as warm as an old-fashioned
nog fireplace. While no unusual skill
was required in landing Modicum first,
Dell presented Hildebrand with a crisp
$1000 bill for hisservices.
The big event was fourth to be de
cided. As before stated the Jennings
stable had first call in the betting at
odds of 18,. to 6. The supporters of
Claude were out on â  dress parade,
crowding 1 the bookmakers': realm until
it resembled a seething, foaming-, bub-
bling mass of humanity, to use a stere
otyped but not patented expression.
FAULCONBRIDGE IS FANCIED.
Bob Smith thought Faulconbridge a
moral with Tommy Burns up, and
among others who coincided with
the views of Bob waa "Plunger"
Joe Yeager, the employer of Hilde

the saddle of Kedfern Eonlc and her
light Impost engrossed the attention
of many, but the mare never possessed
a "look In." Long 'odds were quoted
against the others, Joe Lesser, Ben
MacDhul and Fossil being nibbled at..
It was shortly after "half past 3
o'clock when the horses paraded past
the stand and clubhouse. At the' post
a start could have been accomplished
In no time had It not been for the dila
tory tactics used by Bullman on Ar
gregor and Bedfern astride Eonlc, as
well as the ungentlemanly behavior of
Major Tenny and Ben MacDhul.
DICK DWYER'S GREAT START.
Finally, when ten minutes had been
consumed,- Dick Dwyer yelled "Come
on!" and released the barrier to a mag
nificent start. Otto Wonderly, on the
outside with Oarsman, shortly after
cut across the field; squeezing out
Dainty and bumping Argregor and Ar
cade' among othe'r 'things. Hildebrand
passed the stand first, followed by
Oarsman. Proper and Claude. In 'a
nutshell Modicum splashed along in the
lead from start to finish, Hildebrand

mto the stretch for home, and 'won as
he pleased. Proper looked ' beaten on

Jockey Hildebrand was nat

He said the night before the
race, when Owner Fountain told
him about the ability of Modi
cum to run in sloppy' going, he
felt he was going to rido the
winner. - "At no 6tage eT the

CHOOSES SITE
FOR NEW HOME
Bohemian Club Decides to Boy
Property at the Corner of
Post and Taylor Streets
VALUE OF THE LOCATION
Proposition Becommended by
the Building Committee In
dorsed at Meeting of Directors
The Bohemian Club at a special meet
ing of the members last night decided
to purchase the site at the northeast
corner of Post and Taylor streets for
a permanent home. The proposition
was recommended by the board of di
rectors. The site has a frontage of 105
feet on Post street and 97% feet on
Taylor street. The price is $125,000. in
cluding the synagogue structure now
on the premises. Of the several sites
examined by the building committee,
consisting of James D. Phelan, Thomas
Barbour and David Bush, this one was
deemed most acceptable on account of
Its central position.
The special meeting was held In re
sponse to the following notice:
"SAN FRANCISCO. Feb. 1. 1904.
"There will be a special meeting of
the members of the club on Saturday
evening. February 6. at 8:30 o'clock, to
consider the proposition of purchase of
club site property.
"BOARD OF DIRECTORS.
"By EDQAR D. PEIXOTTO. Sec'y.
"The directory urges every member to
attend, so that the action taken at this
meeting shall conclusively represent the
opinion of the majority."
The directors in due time will pre
sent a plan on which the proposition
may be financed. It was suggested by
the committee that the club should pur
chase the land and building at once,
giving a note with mortgage on the
property as security.
Building plans will be considered in
the future. The corner of Post street
and Grant avenue, the place now oc
cupied by the club, Is worth a million
dollars. The lease will not expire un
til January 1, 1905, and there is an op
tion for a renewal of the lease for a
term of five years. This option is very
valuable and may be of great service
to the club in promoting the enterprise
for the acquisition of a permanent
home.
According to estimates submitted to
the special meeting, a suitable club
house of five stories can be constructed
for $275,000.

rived here with 400 head of beef cat
tle, which he will feed upon sugar
â J><?ets as an experiment to determine
â¢whether or not beets contain the de-
Firod quantity of fattening matter for
beef cattle.
Howard has purchased from the
Hawaiian Beet Sugar Company, which
has large plantations .in this county,
about Â£.00 tons of beets, the unhar
vested. cron that remained in the
ground after the early fall rains came,
paying $4 per ton for the same, and
these he â¢will feed to his cattle.
On account of remaining in the
wet ground the beets had lost a cer
tain percentage of saccharine matter,
which rendered them unprofitable to
work into sugar, and if the experiment
should prov^ successful, and Howard
feels assured that it will, it will be
a source of profit both to the beet
growers and the stockmen. The ex
periment is a new one and will be

TELEPHONE BOX RIFLED
BY A UNIQUE METHOD
Thief Stuffs Slot in Nickel Attach
ment With Paper and Secures
the Coin With Wire.
Anton Delman, who gives his oc
cupation as a cook's helper, was ar
rested by Special Officer F. X. Bur
hams of the telephone company last
night and charged with petty larceny
at the Central police station. It is
alleged that Delman rifled one of the
ferry telephone boxes and also that
he has been doing so for some time
past.
Within the last month many com
plaints have been made to the com
pany that coins have been inserted in
the slot machines and thflt the operat
ors have refused to give service. In
every case the operators claimed they
had received no signal, hence the re
fusal to make the switch. Investiga
tion proved that paper, had been
Wtuffed in the slot, which would pre
vent the coin from falling. As soon
as the person desiring tlÂ»e switch
would leave the box the thief would
sneak in. and with a small piece of
wire or a knife ,. extract the coin.
A watch was set. with the result
that Delman was taken. Into custody

ANNUITANTS
SEEK RELIEF
Board of Education Asks City
Attorney as to Legality of
. liaising 1 Teachers' Salaries
COMMITTEE URGES ACTION
Would Devote Small Portion
of Wages to Swell Receipts
of Tutors' Retirement Fund
A" committee representing the Public
School Teachers' Retirement and An
nuity Society yesterday submitted to
the Board . of Education a communi
cation in which the request is made
that the City Attorney give his opinion
as to the validity of- a plan to in
crease the monthly salaries of all
teachers in the public school depart
ment by the sum of $2, the sum to be
devoted to the payment of annuities
to teachers that have been retired from
active service. As already outlined in
The Call, the sum of $1 a month, which
is now paid by the teachers into the
fund, is insufficient to pay the maxi
mum annuities. Instead of receiving
$30 a month the annuitants are receiv
ing but $25, and it is expected that
frequent inroads on the fund will re
duce the annuities to $20 or even to
$15 a month.
Should the City Attorney pass fa
vorably on the plan it will be neces
sary for the Supervisors to appropriate
the necessary sum, which, for about
1000 'teachers, will amount to $24,000
a year. If this is not done, then an
appeal will be made to the State Leg
islature to provide the means for the
required relief. The communication
follows in full:
SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 6. 19M.
To the Honorable Board of Education of San
Francisco. Cal. â Gentlemen: Whereas, tho
$1 a month now deducted from the salaries of
the teachers of this city. In accordance with
a law entitled "an act to create and ad
minister a public school teachers' annuity and
retirement fund in the several counties and
cities and counties In the State," ii not enough
to pay a sufficient annuity, owing to an in
crease Jn the number of annuitants who have
become incapacitated for performing the duties
of teachers, and whereas, other employes of
the city ffovernment h&vÂ© deductions made
from their salaries of $2 a month to maintain
a fund for the support ot employes who may
become Incapacitated for duty, now, therefore,
we respectfully and earnestly request your
honorable body to increase by $2 a month the
salary of every teacher now or hereafter em
ployed in the day schools and by $1 a month
the salary of each teacher now or hereafter
employed in the evening schools of this city,
we request that the said Increase be deducted
from the teachers' salaries and that the City
and County Treasurer credit the sum so tie
ducted from the salary warrant of each teacher
to the funds as directed by the annuity law
herein mentioned.
We would respectfully request that you sub
mit the following questions to the City At
torney as preliminary to your action on this
petition:
1. Can the Board of Education legally de
vote any portion of a teacher's salary to the
annuity fund: (a) with the teacher's consent;
(b) without the teacher's consent, unless no
provided in the law?
2. Can the board make such order by rais
ing the salaries of teachers?
3. Would a State law be operative In this
city In such cases. If not allowable under the
charter?
Respectfully submitted.

"When the case of Albert B. Mahony,
ex-County Clerk, charged with present
ing a false and fraudulent claim for
allowance to Auditor Baehr, was called
in Judge Cook's court yesterday for
the defendant to plead his attorney,
George D. Cnllins. interposed a^Jemur
rer to the indictment orr the grounds
that it did not charge a public offense
â¢and that it did not conform to the re
quirements of sections 950, 951 and 952
of the Penal Code.
After the demurrer was filed, Collins
argued that the indictment was defec
tive, inasmuch as It failed to allege
wherein the claim was fraudulent or
false. Where fraud is charged the de
tails must -be specified. It was not
enough to follow the words of the stat
ute, but in addition the allegation
must be made wherein the claim was
false and fraudulent. He quoted sev
eral authorities in support of his argu
ment.
District Attorney Byington replied
briefly, contending that it was only
necessary to follow the language of
the statute, 1 as had been done In the
case of McGlade. convicted of passing
a forged claim. One of the cases quoted
by the opposing counsel was that of
an assault with a deadly weapon in
the shape of a stick, and he failed to
see the connection between It and a
case of fraud.
Collins said he would submit author
ities in the Federal courts to further
strengthen his contention, and the
Judge said he would take the matter
under advisement. Meantime the Dis
trict Attorney could submit authorities
in answer to the defendant's counsel
before Tuesday, when a decision would
be rendered.

BOTKIN TRIAL
MUST PROCEED
Judge Cook Bays If District
Attorney Is Not Beady to Go
on, Case Will Bo Dismissed
CLASH IS ANTICIPATED
Arrangements Are Still Pend
ing for the Transportation
of Witnesses From Delaware
From a remark made by Judge Cook
yesterday a clash may be expected be-*
tween him and District Attorney By
ington when the case of Mrs. Cordelia
Botkln, charged with the murder of
Mrs. Elizabeth P. Dunning at Dover,
Del., by oendfng her a bgx of poisonÂ«jtl
candy, Is called for trial on Monday,
February 15. â¢
A date was under consideration for
the trial of Arthur T. Winter, charged
with assault to- rob, and February 17
was suggested by Assistant District At
torney Ashe.
"It can't be set for that day," said
the Judge, "as the Botkln trial com
mences on February 15."
"We will not be ready to go to trial
on that day," replied Ashe, "and will
have to ask for a Week's continuance."
"You will be ready to go to trial
on that day," retorted the Judge, "or
I will dismiss the case. The District
Attorney has had nearly six weeks to
get his witnesses and prepare to go
on with the trial and he ought to be
ready." f
COXTIXCAXCE PROBABLE.
.Ashe did not vouchsafe a reply, and
aÂ« the District Attorney was not in
court the matter dropped.
When the District Attorney was no
tified later of the Judge's remark he
said: "Well, let him dismiss the case.
It will not help Mrs. Botkin any, as I
will take ample measures to protect
the interests of the State. If I had
been present In court I would *iave
asked him definitely if he meant what
he said, so as to be prepared. I will
not now do anything in that direction
till the proper Jme arrives."
The District Attorney has been in
communication with Attorney General
Ward of Delaware as to making ar
rangements for transportation of the
witnesses from that State, but has not
so far heard from him definitely. Un
less the witnesses are all here by Feb
ruary 15 the District Attorney says
he will be compelled to ask for a con
tinuance. â¢
WAITING FOR ANSWER.
"There are two important witnesses,"
he said," "who ask $1000 compensation
each besides their traveling expenses
and expenses at the trial. They are
Professor Wolff, who made the analysis
of the poisoned candy, and Dr. Downs,
one of the physicians who attenil-.-d
Mrs. Dunning and her sister, Mrs.
Deane, who also died. I wrote to Gov
ernor Hunn of Delaware last we'ek,
pointing out that it is as much to
the Interest of his State as it is to
ours that all the witnesses should be
here to testify against this woman, who
has committed a most atrocious crims.
I mentioned the fact to him and also
to Attorney General Ward that the
State of Delaware did not contribute
a cent toward the expenses of the last
trial and I thought they should do
something this time. I am waiting for
their answer, and that is why. I will
be compelled to ask for a continuance.
I do not want to go to trial till I am
assured that all the witnesses will be
here. We cannot, of course, give any
compensation to Professor Wolff or Dr.
Downs."
Wants Suit Dismissed by City.
W. P. Johnson has asked the Super
visors to authorize the City Attorney
to consent to the dismissal of an ac
tion of E. F. Preston against former
Tax Collector Block to enjoin him
from selling property on account of
non-payment of assessments thereon
for the widening of Dupont street. A
demurrer to the complaint was filed,
but no proceedings have since been
had except that a judgment of dis
missal was entered as to another piece
of property.
4- â j.
& Howell have published a very attrac
tive catalogue, with a birdseye view of
the section of the city adjacent to the
City Hall, within 200 feet of which Mrs.
Hayward's property is situated.

Give me a man broken down from dissipation, hard work or worry, from any cause which has sapped his vitality. Let him follow my advice
for three months and I will make him as vigorous in every respect as any man of his age.
I will not promise to make a Hercules of a man who was never intended by nature to be strong and vigorous. Even that man I can make
better than he is; but the man who has been strong and has lost his strength I can make as good as he ever was.
I can give back to any man what he has lost by violation of the laws of nature. I can stop all drains upon his vitality in ten days.
A man who is nervous, whose brain and body are weak, who sleeps badly, awakes more tired than when he went to bed, who is easily dis-
couraged, inclined to brood over imaginary troubles, who has lost ambition and energy to tackle hard problems, lacks the animal electricity which
the Dr. McLaughlin Electric Belt supplies.
The whole force of vitality in your body is dependent upon your animal electricity. When you lose that by draining the system in any man-
ner my Belt will replace it and will cure vou.
Mr. Harry U. Jackson, Valleton, Cal., writes October 1: "Although you are a stranger tÂ» me, my heart warms toward yea u a *reat benefactor and friend, aad I *m morÂ«
than grateful to you. Already I feel the vigor of new life In my body; no aches and no pains. T wish you every success In your work." . t
Letters like that tell a story which means a great deal to a sufferer. They are a beacon light to the man who has become discouraged from
useless doctoring. I get such letters every day.
My Belt has a wonderful influence upon tired, weak nerves. It braces and invigorates them, and stirs up a great force of energy in a man.
I make the best electrical body appliance in the world, having devoted twenty years to perfecting it. I know my trade. My cures after
everything else has failed are my best arguments.
Mr. Roy Burks. McKlttrlck, Cal.. writes: "From the first night I wore the belt I felt new life In every part of my body. ThÂ« weakness was checked Immediately, and I am now
able to do heavy work without tiring. I am glad I thought of the belt, for In no other way could the money bring me so much pleasure." .._...
Give me a man with pains in his back, a dull ache in his muscles or joints, "come-and-go" pains in his shoulders, chest and side. Sciatica in
his hip. Lumbago, Rheumatism, or any ache or paiii, and my Belt will pour the oil of life into his aching body and drive out every sign of pain.
No pain can exist where my Belt is worn.
Mr. J. L. Balrd of Orland, Cal.. writes October 13: "My back Is entirely well, and I would not take $100 for my belt If I could not Ket another. It Is the best thins on earta for
a lame back." " â¢
And these "old" men, these men who have burned the candle at both ends â or even if they haven t â these men who for one reason or another
feel that life has lost its spice, that they are getting old too fast, I can make them feel the sparkle and fire of youth again.
I'll never forget when Mr. A. Crawford of Pokegama. Oregon, an old man of seventy, wrote to me and said: "When I wrote to you last I told
you to send me a Belt to make an old man young, and you did. I am seventy years old, and since I have worn the Belt I feel as strong as I did at
thirty-five, and can do as good a day's work as I could at that age." It was two years ago that Mr. Crawford wrote me that letter. Here is one I
just got from him:
"In reply to your letter I am (lad to nay that I am Just as much In favor of your Belt as I ever was, for It has been a remarkable help to me. I am seventy-two years eld, but
I do not look any more than fifty. Am enjoying perfect health, and will continue to recommend the Belt, as I have been doing rUht along, as I realize that but for It I should have been
dead and hurled by this time." â¢- â¢â¢;. .... .... < -. .- <r < .â¢ > -r^*
They come every day from everywhere. There is not a town or hamlet in the country which has not cures by Dr. McLaughlin s Electric
Belt. " * - J ' â¢ 'â 
Now, what does this mean to you, dear reader? If you are not what you ought to be, can you ask any better proof to make you try it? Is
there a remedy which is as simple, as easy to use, as sure to cure and as cheap as. Dr. McLaughlin's Electric Belt? I have not seen one. You must
try it. In justice to yourself, and to those who look to you for their future happiness, try it now. Act this minute. Such a matter ought not be
delayed. ,
It's as good for women as for men. Worn while you sleep, it causes no trouble. You feel the gentle glowing heat from it constantly, but no
sting, no burning, as in old-style belts.
Come and see me if you can. I have a private consulting room in which I will explain my method of treatment, and, perhaps, give you the
names of some of your friends whom I have cured.

GERMAN BENEVOLENT SOCIETY
CELEBRATES GOLDEN JUBILEE
I Fiftieth Anniversary of Pioneer Charitable Organiza
tion Is Observed, by Large Number of Teutons
With Fitting Musical and " Literary Exercises
The German Benevolent Society of
San Francisco celebrated its golden
jubilee last night at the Mechanics'
Pavilion. The occasion was the fif
tieth anniversary of the German
charitable association. The German
Benevelerst Society was founded short
ly after the birth of this city and for
fifty years the poor, sick and needy
German people of the city have en
joyed untold assistance from the or
ganization.
Last night the Germans of San
Franci5co turned out In full force and
made the jubilee a grand success. The
large hall was crowded to its utter
most with a gayly dressed audience.
The Pavilion w.is beautifully decorated
with a mass of greens, bunting and
flags. Around the main floor were
rows of Christmas trees and palms,
which gave a delicious, woody per
fume to the air. At the end of the
hall was a huge platform, artistically
dressed in the gayest of bunting,
greens and flag?.
On the sides of the floor were strings
of refreshment booths, where the
spectators could partake of the Ger
man hospitality. A pretty canopy of
large American flags, interspersed with
German flags and flags of all nations,
made a perfect blend of beautiful
colors.
Large numbers of prettily uniform
ed nurses from the German Hospital
and cadets from the German school
ship Herzogin Cecllie flitted gayly in
and out of the myriads of promenad
ing spectators, leaking a pretty effect.
PROGUAJIME INTERESTING.
The literary and musical programme
was especially fine and the exhibitions'
given. by tho different turner societies
drew forth well merited applause. Tho
inusic was rendered by the Park

HISTORY OP THE SOCiETY.
Atnonm the manv men who have served
the society so unselfishly, one class is con
spicuous â the doctors. Kor many years dur-
Inir the early c-aretr. of this association did
the very b?*t physicians of the city place their
valuable services, without any charges what
ever, ct the disposition of the society. No
summons froir> the rufferlnr remained un
an*wertd."Of all these rrwn there remains
but one. In our n-'.Jst. Dr. A. Wilhelm,
IVictor, permit me. In the name of the so
ciety, to present you with this medal as a re
peated fijrn of our Fineer**! appreciation. May
it ever remind you that there is no name the
rremb^rs esteem more, than your own.
â¢ WhfneYtr our hiFtory-. shall be published,
there will be no pece written with more
pleasure, or read with more pride, than that
which will be devoted to the patriotism and
the wonderful, voluntary sacrifices of our
women.
In 1877. when our new ho*oital had been
completed, all available funds had been ex
haust*<l, and many thousands were still needed
fcr equlnment. An aroeal to the ladles re
ochxwd frcm /sr and wide with their approval,
ar>d under the competent and sympathetic
leadership of Mrs. Gustav Markus a large fair
took place, which realised ?21,000. Mrs.
Markup, in the name, of the society, do I pre

May iÂ» recall to your mind those days whÂ»n
you rave the best you had. your time and
your energy, for the welfare of your poor
compatriots.
Still tht* last large' sum could not do away
wit:-, all the difficulties in the future. As th
board of directors In 1SS2 esrrnssed them
selves: Notwithstanding balls and festivals
the 'xpenditures far exceeded the income. It
fKined rather a ri?k to. put the phenomenal
F-jccers in the experiment of the first fair to a
necond test; yet there remained no alternative,
and arr.iri the !adirc were called upon. And
aÂ« in the r-ol'.d ranks of a phalanx, fo rose
the entire German population en rnarse under
the sympathetic influence of a triple star. With
Mrs Muser, Mr*. Hce!:t and Mn. Hess as
k-aders, an unexce'lrd enthusiasm was aroused,
resulting, as we ell know, in an extraordi
nary fe-uceess.
The Atlantic Is row stretching between Mrs.
Herht and ourselves, unfortunately depriving
us of the Pleasure of having her with us.
But, Mrs. MuFer and Mr?. Hcfs. I take pleas
ure in presenting yrra In thÂ« name of the so
ciety with this medal, as token of our ever
lasting appreciation.
An augmented mixed chorus under
the direction of J. R. RIegger sang
"Harmonie" and "Die Wacht am
Rhein." At the conclusion of the
Fpeechmaking; and singing fifty young
men and women, artistically costumed,
performed a series of dances on the
stage. They were Ioudiy applauded and
were compelled tb repeat their dance
again and again. The young men were
dressed in white sailor clothes and the
girls prettily attired in short white
dresses.

A grand promenade was then held
and several hundred couples walked up
and down the huge hall to the strains
of sweet music made by the band,

some startling and Interesting feats of
strength and athletic training.

The Mission Verein pupils gave an
exhibition of the formation of a series
of human pyramids, which were named
as follows: The fan, the crab, the strad
dle, the contortion, the scale, the flag
arid the crown. The pyramids were

A Korean Cinderella.
In Korea the people tell a Cinderella
story that Is much more ancient than
that familiar to western people. The
key of the latter story ia the slipper,
but not so theirs. Peach Blossom, the
Korean Cinderella's j rlame, was the
family drudge. One, day as the mother
was starting off with the favorite
daughter to a picnic she said to Peach
Blossom: "You must not leave until
you have hulled a bagful of rice and
filled the broken crock with water."
While sitting there bemoaning her hard
lot she heard a twittering and fluttering
of wings. Looking up she saw a flock
of sparrows pecking the hulls off the
rice. Before recovering from her sur
prise a little imp jumped out of the
fireplace and so skillfully repaired the
crock that but a few minutes' work
was required to fill it with water. Then
she went to the picnic and had a royal
time.â Chicago News.

Citizens of San Francisco
WRITER CHARMS HOSTS
Delivers a Brilliant Address
on Municipal Reforms, 'and
Business Administrations
One of the most able addresses ever
delivered before a gathering of business
men of San Francisco was given last
evening, by Dr. 'Albert Shaw, the dis
tinguished editor of the Review of Re
views, who was the guest of h6nor at
a banquet tendered. him by fifty repre
sentative citizens at> the Palace Hotel.
..Tor. two \ hours Dr. Shaw eloquently
addressed his hosts on the subject of
municipal;: government; and those who
were fortunate enough to listen to the
speaker^ were -loth' to have him con
clude.
,_'The address was one of great instruc
tive value and will certainly have good
results inSan'Francjsco, for those .who
heard the address are - men â¢ who are
keenly interested in' the upbuilding of
Sair Franclscd' and the betterment of
j the 'conditions of the > citizens of this
city. - ; â â¢ ..:â¢â -
Dr. Shaw _ spoke without notes, and
a. tone of cheerful optimism was -ever
present in '- his address. In telling of
conditions in New York City Dr. Shaw
spoke kindly of certain politicians. He
did not attack those who have opposed
municipal reform, and did not' paint a
! dark future for American cities strug
gling with grave problems. The address
was a plain, practical talk that carried
/conviction in every word, and was re
warded with loud plaudits at its con
clusion.
INTRODUCED TO HOSTS.
Frank J. Symmes, who presided at
the banquet, briefly introduced Dr.
Shaw to the gathering. The toastmas
ter paid a tribute to the ability of the
guest of honor and declared him to be
one of the greatest authorities on mu
nicipal government of the day.
Dr. Shaw was greeted with cheers
when he rose to speak. He modestly
stated that he was but a "reporter of
events" arid a student of municipal gov
ernment, and then told how he had first
become acquainted with the possibili
ties of introducing municipal reform in
American cities.
The speaker told how he had gone to
Scotland and there found the existence
of municipal reform. He described the
situation as he found it in that country,
and how he had found the conception
of a modern industrial community. He
said it was the height of his ambition
at that time to write an article on his
discovery and have it published.
Dr. Shaw then described his expe
riences in other large cities,* including
Manchester, Birmingham and London,
and how he had gone to France and
Germany to study municipal conditions
in Paris, Berlin, Vienna and other con
tinental capitals. ' . .'.
In describing his experiences in the
cities mentioned Dr. Shaw said he found
everywhere a desire on the part of some
men to benefit the conditions of the
people at large. He told of the effective
measures taken to fight epidemics and
to improve the dwellings of the poor".
He described the progress made in
those cities, and how the first step in
municipal reform started from a sani
tary point.
REFORMS^ IX IiARGE CITIES.
Referring to the reforms in American
cltieg Dr. Shaw in part said:
It Is a wonder to me what has been done
in th* last fifteen years. We have made great
progress in adapting ttie large cities to the
wellbetnR of the people. Men see clearly
what Js their duty, and that it is not a hope
loss task to undertake BDinethinK for the bene
fit of the. community. '
There have been many obstacles. Including
Government Intrenched In party and the
ppolls Bystem. The first utep In municipal re
form Ftarted In Enelarul. The death rate In
the larpe cities was alarming, and something
had to be done to sive the population. The
sanitary question was the kej-note- to the
whole situation of municipal reform.
When men found they were successful In
dealing with the sanitary question, they
turned In otbÂ»r directions. One sten led to
another In succesp. They took up the ques
tions of cleans'.nc the streets, the problems
of housing the people, Hshtlne and water
questions. They preached the gospel that men
could live whfTe they had to work, and that
H was aulte possible to make the city more
healthy than the country.
Th*n came the question* of education. thÂ»
building of rroper schools and safeguarding
the health of the children. They learned the
right kind of BCteotlflc building of great cities
and the science of rapid transit.
Rapid transit does away with overcrowding.
It eradicates the slum spots, and with thÂ«OnUl
of eompulfwry education we can hope to drive
away poverty.
Large cities no longer fear epidemics. WheÂ»i
men found that epidemics were not to be feared
they gave their attention to beautifying the
cities and finding breathing spots ar.d parks.
Municipal reform started In Europe In 1S75
and It has made great progress In America
under peculiar political conditions.
PROGRESS LV \EW YORK.
In New York City many great things have
been done foi the benefit of the people. New
York Is the pivotal center of the country, and
what Is possible In New York -Is far easier in
other cities. Central Park and the Croton
acfjueduct are 'some of the : great municipal
undertakings of New York, and they have been
studied by large cities In Europe. The build-
Ing of the big bridges between New York and
Brooklyn, the work of rapid transit tunnel*
tinder the rivers, the great rapid transit un
derground system, are tending to solve the
problem of overcrowding 1 .
Dr. Shaw then described the steps
taken for the cleansing of the streets
of New York City. He told of the aw
ful condition of affairs that formerly
existed and how Colonel Waring had
revolutionized them and instit ited a
system that was respected by the poli
ticians who did not dare to interfere.
. TRIBUTE TO ROOSEVELT..
Dr. Shaw paid a tribute to President
Roosevelt^ for the work he had. dose
when Governor of New York State in
securing needed reforms for the me

The scene of this exquisite picture is a Southern sunset in the fall
of the year, when the leaves arc turning and nature pats on her mas-
qnerade. The landscape is tinted with the parting crimson glow of the
setting; sun, all giving the impression of a calm, cool Indian summer day,
when nature, weary with summer's gnyety, is falling asleep in her gala
dress. Fine perspective and harmonious handling of the many tints em-
ployed add to the value of the picture.
The original oil painting has* been reproduced by the newly per-
fected process of color photography, which retains every beauty of line anil
color with marvelous exactness.
The artist, 3fr. Carl Weber, is an American, born in Philadelphia, bis
father being the celebrated landscape painter, Paul Weber. After some
* study in his native city he went to Munich, where for some years he stud-
ied under European masters. He is a landscape artist of unusual force
and sympathy with the beautiful in nature.

ROUTE'S MOVE
People Sec Hand of Oakland,
San Francisco and San Jose
Baihvav in Real Estate Deal
Berkeley Office San Francisco Call,
2148 Center Street, Feb. 6.
In the sale of a piece of property that
has just been made the people of Wal
nut street think they see the first move
of the San Francisco, Oakland and San
Jose Railway in its campaign to secure
a right-of-way through their street
Into North Berkeley. A good deal of
mystery envelops the transaction and
the. parties to it refuse to commit
themselves in any way.
The property In question, consisting
of 17S feet on Hearst avenue and 48
feet on Berkeley way. was sold by
Frank E. Armstrong of Walnut street
to Walter E. Lucas for $10,000. That is
a pretty stiff price and one a railroad
would pay only under pressure. Who
Lucas is is unknown to Berkeley. Fran
cis Ferrier, through whom the sale was
made, says he is a San Francisco spec
ulator, but he will not deny that he is
connected with the "Key Route." Mr.
Ferrier himself is understood to be very
close to the Oakland Transit and "Key
Route" officials and it is known that
he has engineered a number of real es
tate deals for them in Berkeley.
If the "Key Route" has really ac
quired the property, it has removed
one barrier to its entrance into North
Berkeley by way of Walnut street. The
only thing that Intervenes now is the
property between University avenue
and Berkeley owned by Mrs. Sarah
Acheson and others. Walnut street. It
continued from Hearst to University
avenue,, would cut through all this
property. â¢, â¢.â¢
Some time ago the Board of Trustees
was petitioned to open Walnut street,
but the residents objected on the
ground that the railroad sought to get
a franchise through it after the street
is opened. The people do not want a
railroad through 'their street because it
is tco narrow a thoroughfare.
Manager F. C. Havens Is in the East
and W. F. Kelley said that if .rfuch a
move had been made he knew nothing
of It, but that it might have been done
through half a dozen different real es
tate agents who made purchases for
the Realty Syndicate.

RENTS ROOM AT PALACE
AND DUPES CLOTHIERS
Man Registering as "Jack" Corbctt
of New York Makes Away
With Suit.
Who is "Jack" Corbett of New York?
The police have a desire to know and
their inqulsitiveness is stimulated by
a similar desire expressed by the man
agement of the Palace Hotel and the
members of a well-known local busi
ness firm. Yesterday forenoon a tall,
well dressed young man, bearing /the
semblances of an innocent traveler,
presented himself at the counter of
the Palace and grabbing up a pen
hurriedly scrawled "Jack Corbett, New
York." on the register page, asked for
a room and bath, mumbled something
about hi3 three trunks coming along
soon and then turned about and fol
lowed a bellboy up to the room as
signed to him by the clerk.
Two hours later a delivery man
from a Kearny-street clothing firm
asked anxiously concerning Corbett at
the cashier's window of the hotel. He
explained that Corbett had purchased
$50 worth of clothing from the firm
and had ordered it delivered at once
to the Palace, where he said he would
be prepared to pay for it. The man
took the clothes to Corbett's room,
where the latter adorned himself with
the articles and after apparently sat
isfying himself that the fit was sat
isfactory, told the delivery man to
take a seat while he went down to
the office to cash a check. The man
â waited for half an hour for the return
of. Corbett and then becoming alarmed
went to the hotel office, where he was
informed that the new guest had
cashed no checks there and had not
been seen since he had engaged his
room. *As a matter of fact, he has not
been seen since then by any one con
nected with the hotel and the suspi
cion prevails that he took a room for
no other purpose than to dupe the lo
cal clothiers.

establishment of several assemblies in

â¢ General Robert Toombs was as im
pulsive as he was courageous. Once in
the midst of a hot political campaign a
stump orator said something about the
general's arrest by Robert E. Lee for
Insubordination, frightfully distorting
the incident. Toombs wrote one of the
hottest letters of his life and was about
to seal it when a friend entered his of
fice and seeing him much agitated in
quired the cause. The letter was hand
ed to him to read, arrd when he had
finished it he remarked, "You don't In
tend to send it to him?" "I do." said
Toombs. "Better wait till to-morrow,
and think It over, general." "Never, sir!
I have known him to be a liar, a black
guard and a thief all his life, but never
before had cause to tell him so. The op
portunity is now offered, and I wouldn't

It Is believed the man found In the
stable of the Oakland Gas, Light and
Heat Company with a fractured skull
is going to die. His name is supposed
to be Henry Nelson. According to a
statement made by him to Dr. Relnle
he was attacked by two men and
robbed of $40. Aftey lying uncon
scious for several days, he revived to
an extent, but has , been unable to
make a coherent statement of the af

placed on the case to make an inves

"What lends color to . the injured
man's statement is evidence offered
by James Shields, night watchman at
the Yosemite Laundry. He identified
Nelson as the man he saw come by
the laundry with his head bleeding
and in a dazed condition on the night
of the alleged asault- The man was
staggering and Shields says he
thought he was drunk and that his
wound was superficial.

SCENE DURING THE RUN
WHICH WAS CAUSED BY
MALICIOUS RUMOR.
OAKLAND, Feb. 6.â The damage that
can be done by one maliciously In
clined person was shown to-day when
a run was started on the Oakland
Bank of Savings. Untrue telephonic
messages, which have been sent broad
cast through Oakland within the last
two days, caused the run. The injury
was chiefly done to depositors of the
bank, who sold their books to scalpers
or withdrew their savings, sacrificing
Interest.
The bank had plenty of cash on hand
to meet all demands, and, as a matter
of fact, owing to the unusual pros
perity of Alameda County, there was
more money In the vaults of the bank
than they have held for years. Not
only was the bank in this condition,
but in less than an hour after the run
started the Oakland institution had re
ceived offers of cash from San Fran
cisco banking houses ihat would have
paid off, dollar for dollar, every liability
of the Oakland institution.
But In the face of these conditions
hundreds of people stood In line in the
rain before the -doors of the Oakland
Bank of Savings, waiting to draw out
their money.- The run that started
mildly yesterday grew into large pro
portions to-day and by the time the
doors closed at noon more than $150,000
had been paid out. It was given out
by the bank officials tb-nlght that about
400 depositors had closed their accounts
and a little less than 8200,000 had been
paid out. Coupled with this statement
the bank officials added 'that they Had
In coin in their vaults more than two
and a quarter millions of dollars, with
another 52,000.000 worth of United
States Government bonds, which" can be
converted Into cash at a moment's no
tice..
FOUR MILLIONS, OX HAND.
"We stand ready to pay out more
than four million's of dollars In cash
at any time, and could meet, the. total
claims 'of our depositors as fast as we
could pass the money over the coun
ter," said W. W. GarthwaUe, the cash
ier and general manager of the bank
to-night.
All of this shows how easily one man,
who desires to injure.the reputationof
a financial institution, can play upon
the fears of the public. The only' peo
ple that profited by the trouble were
a few scalpers, who made a few dol
lars by" buying . up books from those
that were anxious to get out of the
rain.
Most of the people that withdrew
their accounts did; not. know what to
do with the money, after they; got? it.
One woman took out $12,000; which was
given her in gold coin. When she got
her. money she " sa" t down; and cried. .

to * accommodate those . that \vlsh(^ to

an appointment to the West Point
Military Academy. AH the preliminary
requirements for "entrance into that

POLICE INVESTIGATE.
. The .matter has been turned over to
the police for Investigation and an ef
fort will be made to locate the man
tha/ caused the trouble. Cashier Garth
walte traces the matter to a man who
had a little trouble with the bank over
a claim of $6, whick was finally paid,
but after receiving his money he de
parted making threats against the in
stitution. He is believed to have been
the author^ of the telephone messages
which were sent throughout Oakland.

LEAVES CITIES
OFF THE ROUTE
Haywards and San Leandro
Are 3Iuch Excited Over the
Western Pacific's Plans
BOTH TOWNS SIDETRACKED
Rumor That New Company Con
trols Line Between Fruitvale
and Leona Heights Circulated
Oakland Office San. Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway. Feb. 6.
The people of Haywards and San
Leandro have become much excited
over the discovery; that the "Western
Pacific Railroad will be built from the
Livermore Valley to Oakland without
touching either of those places. It
has never been dreamed for a moment
that the new road would not touch at
these very Important points and the
knowledge that not only had a route
been found that entirely avoided these
towns, but that the rights of way
along this route had been secured,
came as a decided shock to the two
cities that have been crying for rail
road competition.
It is said by a gentleman who has
been interested In securing rights of
way for the new road that the people
of both Haywards and San Leandro
put valuations upon their property so
high as to make it impossible for the
road to buy a line through either
town, consequently the road was com
pelled to find a way up the Redwood
road and then over the hills to Fruit
vale.
But there is another story that is
being told, though it Is not vouched
for by any official of the road. Hay
wards and San Leandro are on the line
of the Oakland, San Leandro and
Haywards electric railroad, now owned
by the Oakland Transit Company. -If
the Western Pacific Railroad had been
built through those cities it would
have paralleled ( within a very short
distance this electric road and would
have injured the value of the prop
erty. The Oakland Transit Company
also controlled the California Railway
to Leona Heights, which furnished an
excellent entrance into Oakland from
the Redwood road on the eastern side
of the hills. This second story is that
the Oakland Transit Company has
agreed to turn over to the Western
Pacific Railroad the line between
Leona Heights and Fruitvale if It
would agree not to parallel the electric
line to Haywards.
The fact that the California Rail
way Is beinsr rebuilt and that no
rights of way have been filed between
Fruitvale and Leona Heights for the
new road gives color to the foregoing
theory.

Beauty and strength in women vanish early in life because of
monthly pain or some menstrual irregularity. Many suffer silently
and see their best sifts fado away. Lydia E. Pinkham's Vege-

freshness of face because it makes their entire female organism J
healthy. It carries women safely through the various natural i
crises and is the safeguard of woman's health.
The truth about this great medicine is told in the letters from
Women published in this paper constantly.

WEDDING WILL TAKE
PLACE IN MARCH
Betrothal of Miss Donna
Felter to Lieutenant
Powell Announced.
By Sally Sharp.
' Cupid has been a busy little chap
this winter and his activity has-borne
good fruit. Scarcely a week goes by
that his handiwork is not made evi
dent by a new betrothal, and this
week has brought a plenitude. And
now comes the announcement of an
affair of Interest to society on both
sides of the bay, the betrothal of Miss
Donna Bloomfleld Felter, daughter of
Mrs. E. A. Trefethen of Sausalito. and
Lieutenant Henry Todd Powell of the
U. S. S. Arcata, now stationed at Port
Townsend.
The fair bride-to-be is a graduate
of Irving: Institute in this city and is
possessed of a most charming person
ality. Lieutenant Powell, who will
claim his bride in early March,' is
evidently popular In navy circles and
is an officer of many attainments out
side of naval affairs, having been
graduated frofti Cornell and Johns
Hopkins universities with honors.
The Doctor's Daughters are busy
again. But are they ever Idle while
there is yet work to do? Money must
be raised for the blessed work they
have in hand,- the caring for the halt,
the blind and the wretched, and they
have planned a splendid scheme to
get it â by giving the public the worth
of \\s money. And herewith is how:
On the 25th of March in the new rid
ing academy on Seventh avenue and C
street they purpose giving a horse
show, a brilliant, dazzling Gothamite
horse show. That will take place in the
evening for the "grownups,"- but that
the little ones may help in' the case of
their poorer brethren and at the same
time have a radiant good time there
is to be a circus, not quite so big, per
haps, as Sells Bros.', but leaving it
at the post as to quality.
Ten boxes have already been disposed
of at private sale, but there are yet
a few remaining.
That the affair will be a society sen
sation Is a foregone conclusion. The
Doctor's Daughters never do things by
halves.
â  The tea given by Mrs. Toy her
daughter Mabel at their Pacific avenue
home yesterday in honor of the Misses
Duffy, of Rochester, N. Y., was a, de
lightful affair.
Receiving with these charming host
esses were Mies Elizabeth Allen, Miss
Ruth Allen, Miss Margaret Wilson,
Miss Florence Gibbons, Miss Elsie
Dorr, Miss Helen Bally, Miss Marga
ret Newhall. Miss Elizabeth Mills, Miss
Marian Huntlngton, Miss Frances Har
ris, Miss Constance de Young, Miss
Bessie Wilson and Miss Elsie Tallant.
How splendid the MardI Gras will be!
Such gorgeous decorations have never

"Who's going?" 'Tis easier to say
who in the smart set is not. The rather
prohibitive price and the excessive sur

About 2500 invitations have gone out,

it is quite probable that close to that

Value of Cold, Fresh. Air.
.. Cold, fresh air has special value be
cause It stimulates all the functions of
the body; it quickens the heart and In

the ; proportion of oxygen in air one
seventh. This is why one feels better
in cold than in warm air. The vital
fires as well as ; fires In grates burn
1 brighter In cold weather. :â  The whole
tide of life moves with greater activity.
' When oxygen Is not plentiful enough

GER3IAX ARMY "THE PERU/*
Says "Officers Corps" Once So Select,
Is Full of Corruption and Vice
Lieutenant Colonel Rousset con
tributes to the Gaulois an article on j
the German army which he entitles j
"The Peril." He says that the novel, j
whether by Bilse or Beyerlein, affords
a faithful picture of the manners of
decadence and decomposition. There
are there clearly displayed such weak
nesses and failings as would defy the
pens of the most determined French
naturalists. The Officers' Corps, for
merly so rigorously selected, seems to
abandon itself to a whirlpool of vio- I
lent passions which little by little (
makes shipwreck of Its dignity, its
prestige, and its authority. It grows
weary of an austerity which was for
merly its strength, and if it retains its
disagreeable arrogance together with
some professional qualities, it is none
the less true that It sacrifices every- I
thing to appearances, and masks be- I
hind its haughty attitude a profound
moral proÂ«.ration. "With the non
commissioned officers, who formerly
constituted one of the most solid !
bases of the edifice, matters are still ]
worr.e. They are represented as the j
c hosen ground of corruption and im
morality. The days are past of those I
chosen servants who devoted them- !
selves to their work with no am
bition than that of a modest pension
and a simple service decoration, "who
had no other home than the regiment,
no other passion than that of their
calling.
Harmful and ridiculous practices go
en In this community every day, but
no citizen dares say a word.

rROMOTEHlS' PROFITS
VARY IiARGELY
The Trust Company Field Has Been
I^arge and Exceedingly
Remunerative.
Everybody nearly Is familiar with
the enormous profits made by the pro
moters of the large industrial combi
nations during the last few years. The
underwriting syndicate that guaran
teed the successful organization of the
United States Steel Corporation made
a profit of over $50,000,000. The promo
ters of the various other Industrials
that have been organized since 1S98
made anywhere from $5,000,000 to $25,
000.000.
The profits made by the promoters of
trust companies and banks are not so
generally known. The organizing of
trust companies, however, has proved
to be a most profitable business to a
number of promoters. One prominent
financier is credited with having made
$300,000 in organizing trust companies
during the last three years. The profit
made by the promoter who organizes
a successful trust company ranges from
$50,000 to about $100,000.
Edward F. Cragln, who organized the
Trust Company of America, is said to
have received a fee of $50,000. The In
ternational Banking Company was also
organized by Mr. Cragin. In this case
it is said that he received a fee of
$60,000. The Eastern Trust Company
was organized by Messrs. Allison and
Meldrum, who received a commission of
$50,000. The promoter of another large
Wall street trust company is reputed
to have received a commission of $100,
000. That was quite a handsome fee for
less than three months' work.
Many trust companies, however, are
organized without any commission be
ing paid for organization expenses. â

GREW BRITAIN KEEPS
TWO KINDS OF ADMIRALS
The "Dry T^and" Sort Never Go to
Sea â Hold Command on In
land Waters.
England has many efficient and eager
sea admirals. Her fleets .will never
â want for men to take command and
face an enemy. She has also a few ad
mirals who have never been on the sea
except as passengers for a holiday trip,
and whose knowledge of a man of war
is mainly derived from pictures in the
papers.
There Is the old Marquis of Donegal.
He is hereditary Lord Admiral of
Lough Neagh. A big-sized lake it Is,
covering over 150 square miles, and not
only the largest in Ireland, but in the
United. Kingdom. No other lake has an
admiral of its own.
The Duke of Argyl is admiral of the
western coast of Scotland and the isles.
His grace, who is the King's brother
in-law, is not a sailor, and has no
great liking for yachting. Centuries
ago the MacCallum More, as admiral/
kept a pretty tight hand over the west
ern coast line and exacted dues from
ships. Skippers of coasting craft were
careful not to offend the chief at Inver
ary Castle.
Although the new Lord Provost of
Edinburgh is a draper by trade he is
also by virtue of his office Lord Ad
miral of the Firth of Forth. In Queen
Mary's time the Lord Provost had con
trol of the Forth and all movements
of warships were regulated by him.
He is even yet entitled to an admiral's '
salute when he boards a battleship in
the estuary. Singularly enough the !
present Lord Provost, who is an en- j
thusiastic volunteer, is both colonel
and honorary colonel of his regiment,
the Queen's Edinburgh â the latter
rank being attached to his office as
head of the city. % '
As regards the old seaport of Leith,
not only is the Provost an admiral of
the Forth, but the Bailies are entitled
to style themselves admirals depute.
In the case of Leith, the present Chief
Magistrate, as a ship owner, is con
nected with the 'sea.
Lord Rosebery is an elder brother
of the Trinity House, and his experi
ence on board his large steam yacht
will help him here. The Sheriff of
Orkney and Shetland, an advocate
and K. C, is vice admiral of these
northern islands, and has to sit In
judgment over knotty questions con
cerning maritime affairs. At one time
Shetland and Orkney held aloof as
much as possible from the Jurisdiction
of the mainland and the vice admiral
was a notable personage.
As admiral of the Humbej. the
Mayor of Hull bears an old title of
honor. It is an ancient institution,
the Trinity House at Hull, and the
musuem contains relics of the great
navigator, Captain Cook.
The Lord Mayor of London Is ad
miral of the port of London. His
Lordship Is three things besides. He is
chairman of the Thames Conservancy,
Coroner, escheater, clerk of the mar
kets, chief butler at coronation ban
quets, head of the hospitals and
trusts. There is no port admiral who
holds so many high offices, and his sal
ary of Â£10,000 exceeds that of other
admirals. In olden days the Lord
Mayor had a magnificent barge on the
Thames, and when he proceeded on a
voyage with his flag hoisted all craft,
foreign or English, naval or mercan
tile, had to salute. â London Globe.- j
SYSTEMATIC TRAINING
OF THE EYESIGHT
The Eyes Can Be Educated and
Their Powers Developed to
a High Degree.
So much of the happiness and suc
cess of life depends upon the seeing
capacity that it is both a wonder and
a pity that more attention is not paid
by parents in the home and by in
structors in the schools to the perfect
ing of this gift. â
The trouble is that the great majority
of people regard the capacity of the
eyes as something fixed at birth, and
not to be interfered with. If they
would think a little they would recog
nize that it is,. after all, largely a mat
ter of exercise and practice. They
know that the power of the muscles is
capable of almost Indefinite training,
but they fail to apply the principle to
the eyes. All forms of exercise are
called upon to increase and strengthen
the muscular system of growing chil
dren, and the wisdom of this, always
granting reasonable moderation, " is
never questioned; but the child with
the weak, undeveloped visual faculty,'
with the untrained color sense, with
the carrying capacity of the sight lim
ited to a few feet, is called stupid; and
his best hope is that he may be fitted
with glasses before he is rallied and
scolded into real stupidity.
The sight can be educated and exer
cised just as truly as the hearing, the
sense of touch, or even the leg and
arm muscles can; and the work,
which can be easily converted into
play, should be begun very early in
life. Much so-called color-blindness
is not a radical defect of vision at all,
but a lack of training in attention and
recognition, and could have been
avoided by any form of simple half
play, half-lesson, with colored balls or
skeins of silk in early childhood.
Matching colors is an excellent game
lesson. It can be carried on with
silks, wools, paper or any other mate
rial in which it is possible to get many
shades with very small gradations of
color among them. Certain of the
educational supply houses furnish col
ored papers for this very purpose. An
element of competition can be intro
duced, and the power of vision can be
trained at the same time with that
esthetic sense which is its greatest re
ward.
Rapidity of vision can be enor
mously developed. Most persons
know the story of the conjuror whose
father made him while a small boy
play the game of naming the objects
In some shop window passed at a
quick walk. If one will try this he
will be astounded at the way the num
ber of objects seen in the glimpse will
grow with practice.
As with other, forms of exercise,
that of the eye should be taken only
under proper conditions. A tired,
worn-out eye Bhould not be forced to
new tasks any more than a tired,
worn-out body. This is why the pro
cess cannot be started too soon, that
the eye may be insensibly trained to
good habits of perception.â Youth's

HOW UNDUE PROFIT
LURES TO CRIME
Makers of Moonshine Whisky Find
Incentive to Their Illegal
â¦ Work In Great Gains.
. Were it not for the large tax imposed
by the Government upon the manufac
ture of ardent spirits there would be
no such thing as "moonshining." An
old revenue officer who has had years
of active experience .in raiding stills
and capturing blockaders, who has had
many a battle with the outlaws and
heard the bullets from their guns whis
tle past him, who has often crouched
behind rocks and stood behind trees,
and who has' done his share in trying
to stamp out the miscreants, Bald a,
few days ago in speaking of blqrckaders
and moonshine whisky:
"I have 'been a revenue . officer for
about twenty-nve or thirty years and
have seen all kinds of service under all
kinds of circumstances, and I don't be
lieve blockading or illicit distilling will
ever be stopped. The. reason for my be
lief (and I am not the only one) Is
simply this: There is such a large
profit In the business that the tempta
tion is too great for most of that class
of people, regardless of the law, not
heeding what has befallen fellow moon
shiners. Even forgetting that they
have once been caught or suspected
and that eyes of the officers are on
them, they go right ahead and distill
the grain. But at the same time, they
are on the lookout for raids and have
their guns ever ready to send a piece
of lead into their discoverer. They 'are
good shots, too, hardly missing when
they have a fair opportunity to take
aim.
"I will give you an idea of how cheap
ly moonshine whisky, is made and the
immense profits that are reaped' from
its sale. They take one gallon of cheap
black molasses, which costs j about 30
cents; two bushels of meal, costing 65
cents per bushel, and some water. This
is made into a mash, allowed to ferment
and the stuff then goes through the
process of evaporation. This amount of
meal, water and molasses makes forty
gallons of whisky, which is sold for $2
a gallon. Any one can see the immense
profit from this illustration.
"Latterly brown sugar has been uaed
instead of molasses and is a great deal
cheaper. The sugar costs about 44
cents a pound: there are 300 pounds in
a barrel, making it cost $13 50 per bar
rel. An immense amount of molasses
is made from a barrel of sugar and the
profit is almost twice as great as in
using the first method. Distillers are
captured every day.' and when they are
sent to prison others take their places
and thus the perpetual flow of 'white
\ lightning.' "

QUESTION* OF THE DAY
,7, WHAT DID ILAXXA SAY?
It is highly creditable to the newspa- ;
per men that the public does not yet
know what that figure was which Sen
ator Hanna borrowed from the game of
poker. He was at the time reported as
saying. "We hold the ace." The next
day he was reported as unspeakably
disgusted that the report had made
him utter a phrase that to all poker
players would be meaningless and sil
ly, and he explained, according to one
report, that what he did say was, "We
hold the age," but another report
makes him say, "We hold the edge."
Now, as the newspaper men are so In
nocent of the game that they cannot
tell whether the Senator said "ace."
"age" or "edge,". wlll( not some unre
gencrate player of that hazardous
game tell us what it was- the Senator
said, and what he meant by it?â

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 7, 1904.
HIGH SEA OVERTOPS LOFTY
SIDES OF STEAMSHIP QUEEN
Vessel's Decks Swept by Mighty Wave Off Umatilla
Reef and Coaster Is Compelled to Heave To-She
Brings 1,600,000 Japanese Gold Yen From Victoria
The Pacific Coast Steamship Com-*
pany|s Queen stands higher out of the
water than any other vessel engaged
In the coast trade, but when off Uma
tilla reef on the passage ended at this
port yesterday one sea climbed higher
than tha Queen's tall sides and de
scended In briny torrents, which tem
porarily converted the upper deck
Into the bed of a boiling- stream.
Fortunately there had been quite
a commotion In wave circles prior to
the arrival of this ambitious comber
and tha decks were clear of passen
,rerB. I When the steamer had shaken
herself free of the water and had re
covered from the shock that accom
panied the deluge Captain Cousin3
hove the Queen to and waited until
the Â«ea had somewhat calmed down.
For some time after resuming: her
way the V steamer traveled at half
speed, and Instead of getting here
early yesterday morning did not reach
port until the afternoon, sixty-seven
hours from Victoria.
The Queen brought from Victoria
1,600,000 Japanese gold yen, which
had crossed the Pacific on one of the
liners running to the northern port.
Light Winds Cause of Long Trip.
Although only ten miles off the heads at
8 o'clock Friday afternoon. It was early yester
day mornins tefore v the British ship St. Mir
ren anchored In tha harbor. With the 3200 tons
of coal in the vessel's hold. Captain Skimrnon
had no trouble. Light winds and, calms were
responsible for the St. Mirren's long; passage
which aroused such grave fears for the ves
sel's safety.
She. left Newcastle. Australia. October 13
and for 115 days did the best sha could with
the light breezes sent to swell her sails. The
voyage was uneventful and very monotonous.
While crossing the bar Friday night two big
seas were shipped, which filled the deck rail
high and overflowing:, but did no serious dam
age.
Ship Seas on Bar.
Ths German ship Nal. which arrived Friday
night, 1S1 days from Hamburg, via Flushing,
narrowly escaped serious damags while cross
ing the bar. The bar was breaking and navi
gation became a matter of grave difficulty.
Huge seas hurled themselves across the ves
sel's path, poked their massive bulk under her
hull and sent the Nal soaring skyward.
Despite the wheelsman's skill, an occasional
wave struck the vessel and Jarred her frame
from end to end. As she staggered on through
the boiling waters the breakers Increased in
size. Four big seas in rapid succession piled
over the Nal's bulwarks and for an exciting
Interval the decks were covered with water
rail-high and sailors, caught in the flood, were
hanging to brace and stay to save themselves
from being drowned on deck or washed away
with the overflow. Wliatever was movable
on the Nal' s deck went overboard, but no seri
ous damage was sustained, and the four seas
were all that boarded her.
Falls Down Hold of Coal Barge.
Thomas Kyer. a longshoreman, who lives at
2617 Harrison street, received fatal, injuries
Yesterday by falling into the hold of a coal
barge moored alongside the steamship Gaelic
at tho Pacific Mall wharf. Kycr was standing
near the open hatch superintending the weigh
ing of a bucket of coal. As he leaned over to
read the scale Indicator his feet slipped and
he plunged through the opening. In addition
to a compound fracture of the right leg, he
eustalned a fractured skull, and no hope of his
recovery is entertained. He was- taken to the
Harbor Hospital and from there removed to
the Central Emergency Hospital.
Small Boy Run Over.
William Brltton, a small boy who lives at
2120 O'I'arrell street, was knocked down and
run over yesterday at the corner of Market
and Montgomery streets. His Injuries, which
were extensive and serious, were treated at
the Harbor Hospital. Louis Tanguy was the
driver of the wagon responsible for Britton's
injuries. The wagon is owned by the Vienna
Bakery, 133 O'Farrell street.
Another Long Tow for Dauntless.
The Spreckcls' tug Dauntless, Captain Shea,
left Friday for Eureka to bring down the
steamer Redondo, which, a few days ago,
stripped the blades from her propellor by strik
ing a log alongside the wharf at the Humboldt
port. The Redondo took a cargo of lumber and
a new propellor Is waiting her here. The
Dauntless has proved a great success and her
services are In demand for long ocean towB.

Nezu York Cotton Market.-
NEW YORK. Feb. 6.â The buying of cot
ton yesterday suppose! to be for a bull pool
in order to regain control of the market, came
to naught to-day, when a sensational break
in Liverpool, very threatening news from the '
Far East, heavy estimates and a bearish I
visible suprly statement rendered the local i
bears more ccrfMTt than ever. '
The New York market opened weak at a loss j
of 44 to 55 points, which had been Increased
tr> B2S76 points on the active months before
the call was completed, with March selling as
low as 13.8-Sc. May 14.05o and July at 14.08c. â¢
Following this there was extensive covering and
prices rallied a few points from the bottom,
but every trlfiine bulK* brought out fresh
pressure, and the market rule<i feverish and ir- .
regular. The New Orleans market cpaned at '
a decline of "0 to 39 points and there was
little 5iÂ£n of New Orleans buying in the local ,
market. ', , I
Trading after the call was only moderately
active.. New Orl-ians became firmer and a cov- j
erins? movement set in here and that, in con- â 
ne-tion with local and Southern bull support. ,
raliiod the market from 3ft to 45 points. The
aJvance met very heavy selling, chiefly from
outside soirees, and in the late trading the
market was very w?*k. being finally easy at a
nÂ»Â» decline of 4O to 4j points.
Closing prices were practically the lowest,
with July quoted nt 13.03c. Sales wsre esti
mated at 200,000 bales. 1

Future Grain and Provisions.
CHICAGO, Feb. 6.â A storm of liquidation
broke ever the fain pits to-day. In spite of
the critical situation in the Orient. Sharp
losses were sus'ainod in all cereals. The
market was unable to rally, and closing prints
were near the low point. May wheat being
oft 1 cent from lart nlsht's close. May corn
closed l%c lower, while oats were down 2^
2He. Provisions were rracticaJly unchanged.
Strength &vA activity marked initial trading
in wheat. That the war outlook was of a
most mrious nature was evidenced by a de
cline In the r.rice of EnsllÂ«h consols. Bhorts
were active buyers at the start, and bid up
the price of the May option Vic to %c above
yesterday's close, the opening quotations be!n;j
at MV'iC to 05Â«4c. July was a shade to %ff%c
higher, at SCc to SC^c. But these prices Iat>ted
only a moment. There was such a quantity
of wheat for 5al?â both May and July deliver
ies â that within five minutes the price oÂ£ May
ha<1 fallen to &l-%c and July to SV>ic This
selling craze wsÂ» Â»r>cn partly exhausted. On
support from the leading Ions the market
quickly recovered part of the early loss. May
rallied to 94vic and July to SOc. Trading was
comparatively quiet durins thn remainder of
the day until within the last half hour. Com
mlMicn-hcuses continued to sell on all slight
rallies, while small holders netz;d every op
portunity to eecure profits. In the face of
fresh war rumors thÂ« ult was delused with
fcellinr orders late in the day. There was not
enough demand to absorb the offerings and. In
consequencp. May broke to 03%c, while the
price of July was carried down to Sl'ic. The
close was extremely weak, with May at 04c,
a net loss for the day of lc. July was irjl',;e
lower, at 54 a Â»c. . . â  .
About the same conditions surrounded
tradlnsr in tbÂ» corn rlt as were VB-itnesyed In
ths wheat market. Hay closed at 5494c, a net
loas of l%c. ' . > . .
The feature in trading In oats was the weak
ness of the May delivery and the comparative
ftrenuth cf July. May closed 2Â©2Hc lower,
at 44\4<M4Uc
Provisions were atrcng- early. In sympathy
with higher Drices for hogs and on war news.

Potatoes, Onions and Vegetables.
As usual on Saturday there was very little
demand among retailers for Potatoes, but
wholesalers reported a good ypeculative de
mand for Oregon fiurbanks and price* were
well sustained. The steamer Oregon arrived
overnight with 7040 sacks, only a small portion
of which were unloaded up to a. late hour. An
other steamer U due to-morrow with 'addi
tional supplies. Holders of river Burbanks
were still asking high prices, but trade on the
wharf was 01 very small volume. Salinas and
Lumpoc Burbanks were closely cleaned up and
sieaay. Sweets were unchanged, with supplies
ample and the demand light. Onions ruled
firm at a further advance and fine Oregon stock
was strongly held on the wharf. The steamer
Oregon brought down 230 sacks.
Receipts of southern vegetables were lighter
than usual, as tho rain in the growing districts
prevented farmers from picking. The demand
was steady and all descriptions ruled tirm at
gocd prices. Cabbage was higher under a
steady demand for shipment to the Southwest
and higher prices are expected in the near
future. A few boxes of Rhubarb came in and
met with prompt sale at slightly firmer rates.
Choice Iota ot new Potatoes (rom across thÂ«
bay were itill selling at 3&4as&er pound.

held over for to-morrow's market. All dealers
are expecting an active market this week, as
the Chlnesa will be stocking up in order to meet

Butter, Cheese and Eggs.
Butter closed the week dull, with stocks
larger and the feelinjr weak. Offerings of firsts
and even extras at 2332$ VAc were still reporter!,
but the quotations below represent the market
as thÂ« majority of the trade quoted it. There
are two elements â one bull and the other bear-
In the market at present, and between them a
range of 2c In quotations is given.
Cheese shows no Improvement and the shelves
continue full of the goods.
A shipping broker reported yesterday that he
could buy store- Eggs at 24c cas Â°d. which shows
a weaker market for this description. Some
commission merchants, too, quoted ranch a
cent oÂ£f. The feeling is not as firm as it has
been, and, though receipts were not as large as
the average for the past three or four days,
they T/cre too large for the market to ab

hand at the close.

Bolton, Dc Ruyter & Co. Meet
Committee of Creditors to
Outline Plan of Settlement
A meeting was held j*esterday after
noon by the committee of the cred
itors of the suspended brokerage firm
of Bolton, de Ruyter & Co. and the
two members of the insolvent con
cern.
The meeting was held in the offices
of the brokers and was also attended
by T. C. Van Ness, attorney for the
insolvents. ,
The members of the committee rep
resenting the creditors stated that
the}' "were perfectly satisfied that Bol
ton, de Ruyter & Co. would be able
to pay all their obligations if given
time.
"We think there are enough assets
In sight," said S. Goidzleher, one of
the committee, "to pay 50 cents on
the dollar right away. This will con
sist of certain accounts due the firm
that are collectable and also two
pieces of realty which Bolton and De
Ruyter will turn over to the creditors.
"We feel satisfied that if the firm Is
given time that it will be able to
realize another 50 cents on the dollar
for the creditors.
"Relatives of the members of the
firm will supply funds on certain un
divided Interests In realty."
The committee has not figured at
all on the mortgage for $38,000 which
was g^ven to Boiton, de Ruyter & Co.
bjr' H. S. Redington to cover bis In
debtedness to the firm.
In Epeaking of this mortgage the
committee of creditors made the fol
lowing statement yesterday:
"The land covered by the mortgage
is located in Colusa County and con
sists of 3600 acres of good wheat land.
There* is; a first mortgage on the prop
erty amounting, to about $27,000. We
find that the - land has been assessed
for $61,000, so. there is every indica
tion that the mortgages can be made
good. It may be possible to sell the
mortgage held by the firm, but we
have not figured on that at all in our
calculations . as to what assets are
available for the creditors.
* 'The creditors have not asked for
a receiver to be appointed for Bolton,
de Ruyter & Co. and will not ask for
one. We have allowed the firm to
continue in charge of Its aaffirs, and
this committee is satisfied that the
creditors will be paid in full, but it
will take some time.
â¢"We do not think for a minute that
Bolton or De Ruyter had any knowl
edge that their manager, Genung, was
using the credit of their firm for spec
ulations for outside persons. We
think that the .firm members have
been guilty of negligence in not keep
ing in close touch with their busi
ness."
Genung, ftie manager for Bolton, de
Ruyter & Co.. Btill maintains silence
as to his actions in using the firm's
credit for irresponsible customers.
Genung is assisting the experts in
working on 'the books and in the
course of a few days Bolton, de Ruy-

nual Meeting and Chooses New
Officers and Directors.

cesca Relief Society Miss Inglls, the

Opposed to Rock Crusher.
Mary's Help Hospital, by P. E. Mul
ligan, secretary, yesterday filed a pro
test with the Board of Supervisors
against the establishment of a rock
crusher and quarry at Thirtieth and
Castro streets. The petitioner also re
quests the passage of the proposed or
dinance extending the prohibitory
limits for rock crushers so as to in
clude Thirtieth and Castro streets. The
two blocks opposite the proposed
quarry are the property of Mary's
Help Hospital and the petitioner says
the site will be greatly depreciated in
value by the location of a quarry in
such proximity. The two ordinances
extending the limits will be passed to
print at to-morrow's meeting of the
Supervisors.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 7, 1904.
CEMETERY LAW
IS CONTESTED
Federal Court Is Asked to
Declare the Urban Burial
Ordinance Unconstitutional
Directors of Laurel Hill Cemetery
and many owners of burial plats in
the tract are dissatisfied with the re
cent decision of the State Supreme
Court to the effect that the ordinance
approved March 30, 1900, prohibiting
further burials therein or anywhere else
within the limits of the city and county
of, San Francisco is invalid. Suit to
determine the constitutionality of the
ordinance was filed yesterday In the
United States Circuit Court by Bessie
Hume, who names as defendants the
Laurel Hill Cemetery, the city and
county of â  San Francisco, Mayor
Schmitz, the Board of Supervisors, Dr.
Rafran and the Board of Health.
The complaint sets forth that in No
vember, 1903, she applied to the ceme
tery association for permission to bury
the body of Sarah R. Macbeth in the
family plat, where had been previously
interred the bodies of her husband,
Robert Stuart Macbeth; their three
children and their grandchild, and that
the cemetery authorities refused to per
mit the Interment to take place, alleg
ing as* a reason the prohibitive ordi
nance of March 30. The Board at
Health likewise refused to grant a per
mit for the burial for the same reason.
Many things in the complaint read
more like a chapter of the ancient his
tory of this city than a dry legal docu
ment, such as complaints on consti
tutional questions are supposed to be.
For instance, it Is recited that on May
30, 1854, Nathaniel Gray and his asso
ciates devoted the Laurel Hill tract of
land for the purposes of a rural ceme
tery, and that on that occasion C. K.
Garrison, Mayor of the city, delivered
an address; that Hon. E. D. Baker de
livered occasional addresses, and was
burled there on December 11, 1861. Then
the complaint goes on to say that Rev.
Thomas Starr King, standing by Bak
er's unfilled grave, said: "We have
borne him now to the home of the dead,
to the cemetery which, after fit ser
vices and prayer, he devoted in a ten
der and thrilling speech to its hallowed
purposes."
"A poem written for the occasion,"
continues the complaints "was read by
'its author, Frank Soule, and Right
Rev. William Ingrraham Kip delivered
the dedicatory address." Several
hundred words of this address are
1 quoted in the^ complaint, evidently to
show that the cemetery had been dedi
cated formally to public use as a
cemetery. â¢
At that time, it is averred, the ceme
tery was outside of the corporate lim
its of the city, two miles from the
business center and one mile from any
part of the city used for dwelling pur
poses, and there were no streets or
municipal roads leading thereto. 'It is
alleged thatmp to the time of the con
veyance of the cemetery to the Laurel
Hill Cemeter Gray and his associates
had expended more than $160,000 in im
provements over and above receipts
and had sold to private parties more
GUARDSMEN CALLED UP
FOR ANXUAIi INSPECTION
Not Having Been Provided With
Belts, the Men Cannot Present
Soldierly Appearance.
There Is a report In National
Guard circles to the effect that be
fore long-. In addition to the change
in the adjutant's general office, in
which, in all probability, J! Locke will
succeed General Stone, there will be
several retirements In the upper
grades and that new appointments
will be announced.
The annual inspection by Major
Wilhelm. retired, U. S. A., and tl\e
State inspector commenced last week
and during the current month those
units that are to be inspectd and mus
tered will be in the following order:
The signal corps of the First Brigade;
Troop D, cavalry; brigade com
mander and staff of \the First
Brigade ; headquarters, field and
staff; band and detachment of
sanitary corpa of Seventh Infan
try; Companies A, C, F, B., L, H, E.
M, K, G, D and I, Seventh Infantry;
Troop C, cavalry; Company B, Fifth
Infantry; brigade commander and
staff, Second Brigade; headquarters,
field and staff and detachment of the
sanitary corpa of the Fifth Infantry,
and headquarters, field and staff,
sanitary corps and band, First Artil
lery. The other units will be inspect
ed during March and April, the last
being on April 26.
There is some guessing aa to how
the men will look \ at' inspection, in
view of the fact that they are without
belts and therefore have no place in
which to place bayonets. It was ex
pected that they would have had belts
issued to them long before this, but
there has been a hit6h somewhere and
the result will be that they will not
be able to present the neat and sol
dierly appearance expected of them.
In the Fifth Infantry eight men
have been discharged from the ser
vice of the State, seven on account of
removal and one for good of the ser
vice.
Revenue From Electricity.
The revenue of the electricity plant
of the Mills building, according to a
statement filed with the Supervisors
yesterday, was $2257 25 during 1903
and the expenditures $643 77. The
original cost of the plant was $10,000
and its estimated present value Is $500.

for the consideration of $24,139 79.
The complaint contends that by the
provisions of an act of the Legislature
approved April 18, 1859/ plats which
have been sold by cemetery associa
tions to private persons and Interments
made therein shall be forever thereafter
inalienable, and shall upon the death
of their owners or holders descend to
their heirs at law.
Seven acres remain unsold. These
are valued at $75,000, and are sufficient
for the interment of 9000 bodies. The
contention is made that the prohibitory
ordinance is a municipal law Impair
ing the obligations of a contract, and
that its enforcement deprives . the citi
zen of property without due process of
law.

WILL ABOLISH
CHINESE FILTH
Health Authorities Recommend
Closing of Cellars and Con
creting of Exposed Surfaces
An understanding was reached yes
terday at a conference in the rooms of
the Merchants' Association, in pursu
ance of which the purification of
Chinatown in this city will be con
tinued with vigor for another year.
Old buildings that are a detriment to
the public health will be torn down,
cellars will be closed and sanitary
measures of various kinds will be rec
ommended* to the Supervisors by the
San JTrancisco Board of Health. The
Statff Board of Health, the San
Francisco Board of Health and the
Federal health authorities will co-ope
rate to prevent Chinatown from being
a menace to the health of this city.
The conference of yesterday was at
tended by President Frank J. Symmes
and Secretary LÂ». M. King of the Mer
chants' Association, Supervisors d'An
cona. and Brandensteln, Dr. Blue of
the Federal service, Drs. Regensburger
and Foster of the State Board of
Health and Drs. J. W. Ward and Hass
ler of the San Francisco Board of
Health and Louis Levy, deputy health
officer.
Quite a long discussion took place
before any action was recommended.
The following resolutions were intro
duced by Dr. Blue and they were unan
imously adopted:
Resolved, That it li the sense of this meet-
Ing that the sanitary measures adopted by
the city. State and Federal health authorities
In February, 1903, for thÂ« eradication of con
tagious disease In Chinatown be continued for
bo lonÂ»c a time aa may be considered neces
sary: that the city Board of Health ba re
quested to recommend to the Board of Super
visors additional measures for the wholesale
destruction of rats.
Kesolved. That all cellars, basements and
underground places in the district between
California and Pacific, Stockton and Kearny,
be condemned as places of abode and the same
destroyed: that In case of reconstruction the
owners be reaulred to remove surface soil and
to concrete the area thus exposed solidly from
wall to wall. * -
Resolved. That the work be done under the
direction and supervision of the Marine Hos
pital service and that a meeting of the rep
resentatives of the Marine Hospital service,
the city Board of Health and the State Board
of Health be held once every two weeks for
consultation.
President Symmes of the Merchants*
"Association presided. There was no
difference of opinion concerning the
continuation of the work of purifying
and bettering the Chinatown section.
Some question was raised as to the
relative share of expense that should
be borne by. the city of San Francisco
and by the State and figures were made
public.
It appeared that this city is spend
ing $3850 a month in cleansing China
town and that the State is putting up
about $900 a month for the same pur
pose. The cost to the city is on ac
count of the demolition of old shacks,
the removal of filth and the purchase
of disinfectants that are liberally used
and for labor. The labor item is the
heaviest of any In the ' account. The
expense of; the State Board of Health
in Chinatown* is all Incurred in inspec
tion.

last session appropriated $100,000 for the
protection of the health of the State
against contagious diseases and as San
Francisco pays about one-third of the
taxes for the support of the State. Pres
ident Symmes and the Supervisors, in
attendance said that they thought San
Francisco ought to have a greater
share of benefits from the appropria
tion than $900 a month. This claim was
also based on the fact that San Fran
cisco is benefiting and defending the
health of the entire State. by Its work
in Chinatown. The expenditures for
Chinatown by city and State combined
amount now to $57,000 per annum on
the basis of the figures submitted yes
