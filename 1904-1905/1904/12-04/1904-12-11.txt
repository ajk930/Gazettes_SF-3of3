K this, the fourth lesson of the series, the chords are given
for the key of A and its relative, the key of F sharp minor.
They should be learned from the charts, and then songs or
solos on other musical instruments may be accompanied on the
piano without further musical education. It* you wish to keep the
charts over the keyboard you may start at once to play accom :
panmients, even though you never played a piano beforel
The method of using these charts is extremely simple and'
presupposes no previous knowledge on the part of the pupil. -
When the twelve lessons are completed,- if you. follow them all,
you will be able to play the chords of every key of music and will
have acquired a sound basis on which to build up a thorough mu
sical training.
Place one of the charts at right angles with the keyboard,
so that the small letter D. with a dash above it, on the chart is
directly over D on the keyboard. Then the white spaces on -the
chart will be over the white keys and black spaces over the black
keys.
The top, middle and lower sections on the lower chart rep
resent the three chords, a mastery of '.which will enable any one to
accompany on the piano any song or melody in the key of A, and
the upper chart represents the chords of the key of F sharp minor.
The black letters are to be played with the left hand, the
â¢reel letters vntn u.c ngni iumi. â  ... â¢
' Now, having placed the chart on. the piano, play the black
letter on the top section with the left hand and then the three red
letters in unison with the right hand. Next play the. middle sec
tion in the same way, then the lower section, and then return to
the top section. The small letter D with a dash above it, which
gives the chart position, must not be played.
After a brief "practice these chords can be memorized and
you may phy without the use of the chart.
Proficiency requires a little practice, but no previous knowl-

IT was strange to him. this new
sorrow for FIbylla. lie had never
felt that yet. It was odd that he

rvords Of const rained civility. He turn

"We shall be home very soon."
"Home!" fhe murmured sleepily.
'â¢yes, soon home now, Grantley."
"God help me!" he muttered.
He could not make it out. Some
bew his whole conception of her, of
tho situation, of himself, seemed
shaken. This guilty woman behind
h:m (was she not guilty in all that was
of consequence, in every decision of
bet will a::d every impulse of her na
ture 0 ) seemed to accuse not herself.
but him. HÂ» was torn from the judg
ment sent and set rudely in the dock,
peremptorily bidden to plead, not
to sentence, to beg mercy in lieu of
pronouncing doom. Her wandering
wits and drowsy murmurs had inex
plicably wrought thi* transformation.
And why? And how?
Was it because she had been capable
of the fairy ride and able to make it
eternal? Capableâ yes, and confident
of her ability. So confident that, in
the foolhardiness of strength, she had
engaged herself to try It with young
Blakeâ with that poor light o' love,
who was all unequal to the great is
sues which he himself had claimed as
the kernel of the fight. Where lay the
failure of the fairy ride? Where re
sided its nullity? How came it that
the bitter irony of contrast found in It
so fair, so unmatched a field? Who
had turned the crimson of the glorious
sunset to the co!d light of that distant
unrewarding moon?
On a sudden her grasp of him loos
ened; her arm slipped away. She gav<Â»
a little groan. He wrenched himself
round in the saddle, dropping the reins.
Old Rollo came to a standstill ; Grant
,ley darted out his hands with a quick
"eaper motion. Another second and she
would have fallen heavily to thfÂ»
ground. With a strain he held her and
brousnt her round and sat her in
front of him. She seemed deathly pale
under blue-white moon rays. Her
lips opened to murmur "Grantley!"
and with a comfortable sigh she
wreathed fcer arms about his neck. He
almost ktesed her. but thought of
young Blake and took up his reins
again with a muttered oath.
So they rode down the hill into Mill
dean, old Rollo picking his steps care
fully since the chalk was slimy, and
there were loose flints which it be
hooved a careful and trusted horse to
beware of. The old scene dawned on
Grantley, pallid and ghostly in the
moonlightâ the church and the post
office; Old Mill House, where she had
lived when he v.-ooed her; his own
home on the hill beyond. Sibylla's cold
arms close about his neck prayed him
to see it again as he had seen it once â
nay. in a new and intenser light; to se-j
It as the place where his love had been
born, whence the fairy ride had started
and whither returned. He did not try
to loosen her grasp about his neck. She
Feemed a burden that he must carry,
a load he bore home from out the tem
pest of the winds and waves which he
had faced and fought that night. And
ever, as he went, he sought dimly, say
ing. "Why. why?" "How did It come
about?" "Haven't I loved her?"
"Hasn't she had everything?" Or ex
claiming "Blake!" Or again, "And the
child"; trying to assess, trying to Judge,
trying to condemn, yet ever feeling the
Inanimate grasp, looking on the obliv
ious face, returning to pity and to
grieve.
A jrroom was waiting up. for him.
Grantley roused himself from his pon
derinjrs to give the man a brief expla
nation. Mrs. Imason had meant to
etay at Mrs. Valentine's, but he had
wanted to talk to her on business, and
she had insisted en coming back with
him. Unfortunately she had attempted
to walk, and it had been too much for
her; her bag would be sent home to
morrow. He had arranged this with
the gruff innkeeper, and paid' him a
good sum to hold his tongue. But he was
conscious that tongues would not be
held altogether, and thatâ the groom
was puzzled by the story and certainly
not convinced. This seemed to matter
very little now â as little as young
Blake had mattered. Let them guess
and gossipâ what was that compared
to the great unexplained thing between
himself and Sibylla, compared to the
great questioning of himself by him
self which had now taken possession
of him?' What the outside world might
think Eeemed now a small thing â yes.
although he had been ready to kili
"himself and the child because of it.
He bore Sibylla into the hall of the
house. One lamp burned dimly there,
and all was quietâ save for a shrill
fractious cry. The child was crying
fretfully. The next moment old Mrs.
Mumple came to the top of the stairs
carrying a bedroom candle and wrap
ped in a shaboy voluminous dressing
gown.
"You're back, Mr. Imason?" She did
not see Sibvlla and held up her hand.
"Hark to poor little Prank!" she said.
"He's been crying all the evening. I
can't cuiet him. He misses his mum
my EO."
Could words more eorely condemn
Sibyllaâ the woman who had forsaken
her child? But Grantley gathered her
gently into his arms and began to
carry her upstairs. Then Mrs. Mum
pla saw, and turned on. him eyes full
of wonder.
"She's unconscious, I think," he said.
"She can do nothing for herself. I'll
take her to her room and vou must
put her to bed. She's verv cold. too.
You must make her warm. Mrs. Mum
ple." \
The old wcir.an followed him into the
bedroom without a word. He laid Si
bylla on the bed. For ah instant she
opened her eyes and smiled tenderly
DOUBLE HARNESS
at him: then she fell into oblivion
again. â¢ Mrs. Muniple moved quickly
to her. Standing by her, ranged on
her side In a moment by some subtle
instinct, she faced Grantley with an
air of defiance. *v: â¢
"1/ave her to me, Mr. Imason. Leave
the :>oor child to me."
"Y<-s." he answered. "Get her to bed
as soon as you can. Good-night,"-
Mrs. Mumble was teeling Sibylla's
fac*>. her hands, her ankles. She began
to unbutton the wet boots hastily.
'What have you done to her?"' she
asked in motherly indignation. "Poor
lamb:"
She pulled off the boots and felt the
damp stocking w *th low exclamations
of horror. She, was in her element,
fussing over somebodv she loved. She
pot a rouch towel and knelt down to
strip off the stockings.
"I can leave' her to you now," said
Grantley, arid he walked out of the
room, c'ofintr the door behind him.
In the silliness of the house he heard
ihe little peevish cry again; the.com-
plair.t in -it was more intense, as
though the thiid missed old Mrs. Murn
plt'e care ar.d feared to be alone.
C'rar.tk-y went ulons the passage and
into ths nurserr. A night light burned
by the cot. The door of the adjoining
room stood o;Â»en a few inches, but all
was 'dark -ivA cuiet in there. When
Grantley came near the child saw him
and stretched out his little arms .to
him in a gesture which seemed to com
bine welcome and entreaty. Grantley
shook his head, smiling whimsically.
"I reorder what the little beggar
wants! I'm devilish little use," he mur
mured. But he lifted little Frank from
the cut, wrapped htm in a blanket and
carried him to the fireside. "I wonder
if I ousht to feed him?" he thought.
â¢What's the nurse up to? Oh, I suppose
she's left him to old Mumples. Why
didn't she feed him?"
Then U struck him that perhaps
Frank had been fed too much and he
shook his head gravelv over such a
trying: situation as that. Frank was
lamenting stillâ more gentlv, but in a
remarkably persevering way. "He must
want something," Grantley concluded;
and his eyes fell on a cup which stood
Just within the fender. He stooped
-down and stuck his finger into it and
found it half full of a warm, thick,
semi-liquid stuff.
"Got it!" he said in lively triumph,
picking up the cup and holding- it to
Frank's lips. The child sucked it up.
"Well, be likes it, anyhow; that's
something. I hope It won't kill him!"
mused Grantley. as he gentlv drew the
cup away from the tenacious little fin
gers.
Frank stuck one of the fingers In
his mouth, stopped crying and in. an
instant, seemingly, was sound asleep.
Grantley got him into a position that
he guessed would be comfortable, ana
lay back in the chair, nursing him on
his knees.
In half an hour Mrs. Mumple came in
and found them both sound asleep in
front of the fire. She darted to them,
and shook Grantley by the shoulder.
He opened hie eyes with. a start.
"My gracious. you might have
dropped him!" -
"Not a bit of it! Look how he's hold
ing on!" He showed a litle hand
clenched tightly round his forefinger.
"He could hang like that,. I believe!"
"Hang, indeed!" muttered Mrs. Mum
ple resentfully. "Give him to me, Mr.
Imason."
'"Oh. by all means! But, by Jove, he
doesn't want to go, you know!"
He did not want to go, apparently,
and Grantley was quite triumphant
about it. Mrs. Mumple was merely
cross and grumbled all the time till ehe
got the little fingers unlaced and
Frank safe in his cot again. ".It's a
mercy he didn't fall into the fire," she
kept repeating, with a lively and ag
gressive thankfulness for escape from
a danger excessively remote. But she
made Grantley ashamed of not having
thought of it. At last she spoke of
Sibylla.
"She's warm and comfortable and
sleeping now. poor lamb!" she said.
"It's time we all were," said Grant
ley, making for the door.
"You won't disturb her, Mr. Iamson?"
He turned round to her. smiling.
"No," he said. . */. â 
Mrs. Mumple moved her fat shoulders
in a helpless shrug. She had made out
nothing about the matter; she was
clear only that Sibylla had somehow
been disgracefully ill-used and that
Frank might very well have fallen into
the fire. Of these two things she was
unalterably convinced. But she spoke
of one of them only; the other was de
clared in her hostile eyes.
Against his willâ perhaps against his
promiseâ Grantley was drawn to his
wife's bedside. He trod very softly.
The only light in the room came from
the bright flickering flames of the flre
They lit up her face and her throat
where he had torn her nightgown apart
He felt the white neck very lightly
with his hand. It was warm â healthily
warm, not feverish. She had taken no
hurt either from storms within or from
storms without She slept deeply now;
she would awake- all well on the mor
row. She would be herself again on
the morrow. He thanked heaven- for
that, and then recollected what it
meant. Herself was not the woman
who murmured "Grantley!" and
dreamed of the gold and the fairy ride-
Herself was the woman who could not
live with him. who had forsaken the
child, who had gone to Walter Blake.
To that self she would awake to-mor
row. Then was it not better that she
should -never awake? Ought he not to
be praying heaven for thatâ praying
that the death which had passed by
him and his son should, in its mercy,
taken her now?
Aye, that was the easiest wayâ and
from his heart and soul Grantley de
spised the conclusion. His face set as
it had when he faced her in the dingy
inn and tore her from her lover's ready
arms. His courage rose unbroken from
the ruins of his pride. He would fight
for her and for himself. But how?
There must be a way.
Suddenly she raised herself in the
bed. In an instant he had drawn back
behind the curtains. She neither saw
him nor heard. For a moment she sup
ported herself on her hand, with the
other flinging back her hair over her
shoulderB. Then, with one of her splen
did lithe easy movements, she was out
of bed and had darted quickly across
to the door.
Grantley watched her, holding his
breath, in a strange terror lest she
should discover him, fearful that in
such a case her delusion might still
keep its hold on her â fearful too of
the outrage his presence would seem if
it had left her. She opened the door
wider, and stood listening for fully a
couple of minutes; it seemed to him
that the time would never end. Then
she carefully set the door halfway
ajar, and turned to come back to her
bed. She walked slowly now, and
looked toward the flre, stretching out
her hands toward it for a moment as
she came opposite to it. The flames
illuminated her face again, and he saw
on her lips a smile of perfect happl-
ness. All was well; there was no cry
ing in the house; the child slept. That
was all she thought of, all she cared
about; her brain was dormant, but her
Instinct could not sleep. Now that it
wag satisfied, with a buoyant spring
she leaped on the bed and cuddled the
clothes about her happily. ./
i I?i a , few seconds Grantley stole si
lently from the room. He went down
stairs and he ate and drank: he had
touched next to nothing for twelve
hours. His blood stirred as warmth
and vigor came back to him. He
thanked heaven that he lived, and the
boy lived, that she lived and was with
him still. His head was high and his
? OU1 ?Z* unbroken. He looked on what
ne had been, and understood ; yet he
was not dismayed. Guided by the
smile on her lips, he had found the
vay. He had been right to bring her
back, or she could not have smiled
like thatâ in all the plenitude of love
for the little child, a love that waked
while reason slept, but would not let
her sleep till it was satisfied. If that
was in her who had forsaken the child
so her love for him. vas in her who
ha<Tleft him to -go to Walter Blake.
If that were true, then there must be

Somehow, he knew not how, salva

mind leaped on. to a vision of bonds of

little hands. v
CHAPTER XVIH.
Roseate Hues.
I Tho Raymores were holding up their
heads againâ such good reports came
from Buenos Ayres. The head of
Charley's department had written a
letter to Raymore, speaking highly of
the lad's good conduct and ability, and
promising him early promotion. Ray
more showed it to Kate, and she read
it with tears in her eyes. ,
"You see he's going to give him a
holiday at Christmas, . and let him
spend a month with us," said Ray
more," pointing out a passage in the
letter. - .
"Come on a visit, he says." she
looked up with a question glance.
Raymore understood the question. *
"Yea, my dear," he said gently. "He'll
pay us a visitâ many visits 1 , I hope â
but his career must lie- over
That'.* inevitable, and best on all
grounds, I think." . He came and took
her hand, adding, "We must' be; brave
about that." '. ; â¢ : 'i"j'
"I'll try," said Kate.
She knew that was the" penalty which
must be paid. Over here the past
would never be utterly burled. Charley
would never be quite safe. from -it. '-He
must buy safety and afresh, start at
the price; of banishment. . His mother
faced the'bitter conclusion.
"We must make the most of the vis

brave."

"We must give him a splendid time
while he's with us," said Raymore. and
kissed her. "You've been fine about
it," he whispered: "keep it up."
The penalty was high, or seemed so
to a mother, but the banishment was
not all evil. The boy's absence united
them as his presence had never done.
At home he had been an anxiety often,
and sometimes a cause â¢ of distress, to
them. All that was gone now. He
was a bond of union, and nothing else.
And his own love for them came . out.
When he was with them, a lad's ahame
facedness, no less than the friction of
everyday life, had half hidden it. His
heart sr>oke out now from across the
Seas; he wrote of home with longing:
it seemed to grow something holy to
him. He recounted artlessly the words
of praise and â¢ the marks of confidence
hehad.won; he was pleading that they
made him worthy to pay his Christmas
visit home. Whenever . his. letters
came, Raymore and Kate had a good
talk. together over them; the boy's open
heart opened their hearts also to one
anotherâ yes. and to Eva; too. They
paid.more attention. to Eva, and were
quicker to understand her growth, to
see how she reached forward to woman
hood, and to be ready to meet her on
this new. ground. She responded read
ily, with the idea that she must do all
she could to lighten the sorrow and to
make Charley's absence less felt. In
easy-going times people are apt to be
reserved. The trouble and the worry
broke up the . crust â¢ which had formed
over their hearts. ; All of themâ even
the boy so far away â were nearer to
gether.
This softened mood, and the gentler
atmosphere which reigned in the Ray
mores' household, had its effect ; on
Jeremy Chiddingfold's fortunes. It
caused both Kate and Raymore to look
on at his proceedings with indulgence.
They were constantly asking them
selves whether they had not been too
strict with Charley, 'I and whether the
calamity might not have been pre
vented if they had : encouraged him to
confide in them more, and to bring his
difficulties to them. They were
nervously anxious to make : no such
mistake in regard to Eva. They were
even in a hurry to recognize that;Eva
must consider herselfâ and .therefore
be / consideredâ a young .' woman. Â» A
pretty young woman,;. to. .bqott And
what 'did.' pretty' young' women, likeâ

she was encouraged along the natural
path. And it was difficult to encourage
Eva without encouraging Jeremy tooâ

Kate was undoubtedly in a senti

year from the dyeing works did not
trouble her. Half unconsciously, in

nod secretly and significantly at her

was beginning to show a good deal of
character. This might be true In a
sense, since all qualities go to charac
ter, but it was hardly true in the usual
sense. Christine Fanshaw used always
to say that Eva was as good as gold
and there she would leave the tonic
without further elaboration. ' \ '
B&SSS!"? Was the sort of rl Jeremy
liked. He saw in himself now a man
of considerable experience. Had he not
grown up side by side with Sibylla her
whims and her tantrums? Had* he not
watched the development of Anna Sel
ford's distinction, and listened to her
sharp tongue? Had he not cause to re
member Dora Hutting's- alternate- co
quettishness and scruples, the one sure
ly rather forward (Jeremy had been
revising his recollections), the other al
most inhuman? Reviewing, this wide
field of > femlne varietv Jeremy felt
competent to form a valid judgment;
and he. decided that gentleness,âtrust
fulness and fidelity were' what a man
wanted. He said as much to Alec Tur
ner, who told him,, with unmeasured
scorn, that his ideas were out of date
and sadly retrograde.
"You want* a slave," said Alec with
eringly. . ._, .
"I want a helpmeet," objected Jer
emy.
"Not you! A helpmeet means an
equalâ an intellectual equal." Alec in
sisted hotly. He was hot on a subject
which did not seem necessarily to de
mand warmth because he too had de
cided what he wanted. He had fallen
into a passion which can.be described
only as unscrupulous. He wanted to
marry clever, distinguished, brilliant
Anna Selfordâ to marry her at a reg
istry office and take her to live on two
pounds a week (or thereabouts) In two
rooms up two pairs of stairs in Batter -
Fea. Living there, consorting with the
people who were doing the real think
ing of the age, remote from the batted
bourgcolse. she would really be able to
Influence opinion and to find a scope
for -her remarkable gifts and abilities.
He sketched this menage in an abstract
fashion, not mentioning the lady s
name, and was much annoyed when
Jeremy opined that he "wouldn't find a
girl in London to do it."
"Oh, as for you, I know you are go
ing to become a damned plutocrat,"
Alec said, with a scornful reference to
the dyeing works.
"Rot!" remarked Jeremy, but he was
by no means so annoyed at being ac
cused of becoming a damned plutocrat
as he would have been a year earlier,
before he had determined to seek
Fpeedy riches and fame in order to daz
sle Dora Hutting, and when he had
not encountered the gentle eyes of Eva
Raymore. Whatever. else plutocrats (if
we may now omit the epiphetus or
nans) may or may not do in the econo
my and service of the commonwealth,
they can at least give girls they like
fine presents, and furnish beautiful
houses (and fabrics superbly dyed) for
their chosen wives. There are, in short,
mitigations of their lot. and possibly
excuses for their existence.
Jeremy's state of mind may easily
be gauged. The dyeing works were
prominent, but, the experience of life
was to the front too. He was working
hardâ and had his heart in his play
besides. For his age it was a healthy,
and a healthily typical, existence. The
play part was rich in complications not
unpleasurable. The applause of large,
admiring brown eyes is not a negligible
matter in a young man's life. There
was enough of the old Jeremy surviv
ing to make the fact that he was fall
ing in love seem enough to support an
excellent theory on the subject. But.
on the other hand, he had meant the
fame and riches for Dora Huttingâ to
dazzle her anyhow â whether to satisfy
or to tantalize her had always been a
moot point. In imagination Jeremy
had invariably emerged from the pro
cess making wealth -and fame either
unalterably faithful or Indelibly mi
sogynlstic â Dora being the one eter
nal woman, though she might be
proved unworthy. It had never oc
curred to him that he should label the
fame and riches to another address.
To be Jilted may appear ludicrous to
the rest of the world, but the ardent
mind of the sufferer contrives to re
gard it as tragic. A rapid transference
of affection tends to impair the dignity
of the whole matter. Still, large brown
admiring eyes will countâ especially if
one. meets them every . day. Jeremy
was profoundly puzzled about himself,
and did not suppose that just this sort
of thing had ever occurred before.
Then a deep sense of guilt stole over
.him- Was he trifling with Eva? He
hoped not. But of course there is no
denying that the !dea of trifling with
girla has its own attractions at a cer
tain age. At any rate to. feel that you
mightâ and could â is not altogether an
unpleaslng "sensation. However Jere
my's moral sense was very strongâ the
stronger (as he was in the habit of
assuring Alec Turner) for being based
on pure reason and the latest results
of sociology. Whenever Eva had been
particularly sweet and admiring, he felt
that he ought not to go to Buckingham
Gate again until he had put his rela
tions with Dora Hutting on an ascer
tained basis. He would knit his brow
then, and decline to be enticed from
his personal problems by Alec's invi
tations to general discussion. At this
stage of his life he grew decidedly
more careful about his dress, not aim-
Ing at smartness. - but at a rich and
sober effect. And all the while he
started for Romford at 8 In the morn
ing. He was leading a very finÂ© ex
istence.
"These are very roseate hues, Kate,"
Christine Fansbaw observed with deli
cate criticism as she sipped her, tea.
Kate had been talking about Eva' and
hinting benevolently about Jeremy.
"Oh, the great trouble's always be
hind. No, it's not so bad now, thank
heaven! But if only he could come
back for good! I'm sure we want
roseate hues!"
"I daresay we do," said Christine,
drawing nearer the fire. It was au
tumn now, and she was always a chilly
little body.
"Look at those wretched Courtlands.
And . somehow I don't believe that
Grantley's marriage has been alto
gether successful."
She paused a moment, and there had
been a questioning inflection in her
voice; but Christine made no comment.
"For myaelf I can't complain "
"And you won't get enything out of
me, Kate."
"But we do want the young people to
âto give us the ideal back again."
"I suppose the old people have al
ways thought the young people were
going to do that. And they never do.
They grow into old people â and then
the men drink, or the women run
away, or something."
"No, no," Kate Raymore protested.
"I won't believe it, Christine. There's
always hope with them, anyhow.
They're beginning with the best, any
how!"
"And when they find It isn't the
best?"
"You're â you're positively sacrilegi
ous!"
"And you're disgracefully senti
mental." â¢ Â»
She finished her tea .and sat back, re
garding her neat boots.
"Walter Blake's back In town," she
went on. .-â¢ 'J.- â â 
\ "He's been yachting, hasn't he?"
"Yes, for nearly two months. I met
him. at the Selfords*."
A moment's pause followed.
"There was some talk " began
Kate Raymore tentatively.
"It was nonsense. There's some talk
about- everybody."
Kate lauehed. "Oh, come, speak for
yourself, Christine."
"The Imasons are down in the coun
try."
"And Walter Blake's -in town? Ah,
well!" Kate sighed thankfully.
"In townâ and at the Selfords'." She
spoke with evident significance.
Kate raised .her brows.
"Well, it can't be Janet Selford, can
it?" smiled Christine.
. "I -think. he's a. dangerous man." ...
"Yesâ he's so silly."
< "You do meanâ Anna?"
"I've said all I mean, Kate. Anna
has come on very much ot- late. I've
dressed her. you know." "â  â  . , ;
"Oh, that you can do!"
"That's why I'm such a happy worn-
an. Teach Eva to dress badly!" >."â¢ â Â«;-'.
Again Kate's brows ro3u In remon
strance or Question.
''Oh,* no, I don't mean it, of course.
What would be the pood, when most
men don't know the difference?"
"You're certainly a Â£on<3 corrective
to idealism."
"I ought to bo. Well. veil. Anna can
look alter herself."
"It isn't as if one positively knew
anything against him."
"One might mind one's own business.
even if one did." Christine observed.
"Oh, I don't cuite agree with you
there. If one saw an innocent girl "
"Eva? Oh, you mothers!"
"I suppose I was thinking of her.
Christine, did Sibylla ever â â ?"
"Not the least. 1 believe." said Chris
tine with infinite composure.
"It's no secret "Walter Blake did."
"Are there any secrets?" asked
Christine. "It'd seem a pity to waste
anything by making a secret of it. One
can always get a little comfort by
thinking of the pleasure one's sins have
given. It's really vour duty to your
neighbor to be talked about. You
know Harriet Courtland's begun her
action? There'll be no defense, I sup
pose!"
"Has she actually begun? How
dreadful! Poor Tom! John tried to
bring her round, didn't he?"
A curious smile nickered on Chris
tine's lips. "Yes, but that didn't do
much good to anybody."
"She flew out at him, I suppose?"
"So I understood." Christine was
smiling oddly still.
"And what will become of those un
happy children?"
"They have their mother. It nature
makes mistakes in mothers, I can't
help it, Kate."
"Is she cruel to them?" .
"I expect so â but I daresay It's not
so trying as a thoroughly well conduct
ed home."
"Really, it's lucky you've no chil
dren," laughed Kate.
"Really it is, Kate, and you've hit
the truth," Christine agreed.
Kate Ravmore looked at the prett7
and still youthful face, and sighed.
"You're too good, really, to say that."
Christine shrugged her shoulders im
patiently. "Perhaps I meant lucky for
the children. Kate," she smiled.
"And I suppose it means ruin to
poor Tom? Well, he's been very silly.
I met him with the woman myself!"
"Was she good looking?"
"As if I noticed! Why, you might be
a man! Besides it was only decent to
look away." -"-:
"Yes, one looks on till there's a row
â and then one looks away. I suppose
that's Christianity."
"Now, really, I must beg you, Chris
tine "
"Well, Eva's not in the room, is she.
Kate?"
"You're Quite at your worst this aft
ernoon." She came and touched her
friend's arm lightly. "Are you un
happy?"
"Don't! It's your business to be good
and sympatheticâ and stupid," said
Christine, wriggling under her affec
tionate touch.
"But John's affairs are ever so much
better, aren't they?"
"Yes, ever so much. It's not John's
affairs. It's Good gracious, who's
this?"
Something like a tornado had sud
denly swept into the room. It was
Jeremy in a state of high excitement.
He had a letter in his hand, and
rushed up to Kate Rayinore, holding
it out. At first he did not notice Chris
tine.
"I've had a letter from Sibylla "
he began excitedly.
"Any particular news?" asked Chris
tine quickly.
"Oh, I beg your pardon. Mrs. Fan
shaw! I â I didn't see you." His man
ner changed. Christine's presence evi
dently caused him embarrassment.
"No; no particular news. It's â it's not
about her. I mean."
"I'll go if you like, but I should
dearly like to hear." ShÂ© looked Im
ploringly at Jeremy: she was thinking
that after all he was a very nice boy.
"Give ma the letter, Jeremy. Show
me the place," said Kate Raymore.
Jeremy did as she bade him, and
stood waiting with eager eyes. Chris
tina made no preparations for going;
she thought that with a little tact sh*
might contrive to stay and hear thÂ»
news. She was not mistaken.
"Dora Hutting engaged!" said Eats,
with a long breath.
Jeremy nodded portentously..
"Good gracious me!" murmured
Kate.
"To a curate â a chap who's a. curate,"
said Jeremy. His tone was full of
meaning.
"Wasn't she always High Church?**
asked Christine sympathetically.
"Why, you never knew her, Mrs.
Fanshaw?"
"No, but most curates ar* High
Church now, aren't they?"
"It's very curious, isn't it. Jeremyf*
asked Mrs. Raymore. "Met htm at
her aunt's, I see Sibylla says."
Jeremy stood before the flrÂ» with
knitted brows. "Yes, at her aunt's,"
he repeated thoughtfully.
"Why is it curious, Kate?"
"Oh. you know nothing about it.
Christine."
"I'm trying to learn â if Mr. Chid
dlngfold would only tell me."
"It's nothing. It'sâ it's Just a girl
I used to know, Mrs. Fanshaw."
"Ah. those girls one used to know,
Mr. Chiddlngfold!"
Jeremy laughedâ he laughed rather
knowingly. -cVT? â 'â â ' . ' ; <
"And shs's consoled herself?" pur
sued Christine.
"Oh. come now, I say, Mrs.. Fan
shaw!"
"It's no use trying to be serious with
her, Jeremy. We'll read all about it
when she's gone."
"Yes, all right. But to thinkâ! Well.
I'm dining here, am I not?"
"Oh, yc5," said Christine reassur
ingly.
"Christine, you're very impertinent.
Yes, of course. Jeremy, and we'll dis
cuss it then. Why don't you find Eva?
She's in the library, I think."
"Oh, is she? Then Iâ I might as well,
mightn't I?" He spoke listlessly, al
most reluctantly. And he did not leave
the room by a straight path, but draft
ed out , of it with an accidental air,
fingering a book or two. and a nick
nack cr two on his devious way. Chris
tine's eyes followed his erratic course
with keen amusement.
"You wicked woman!" she said to
Kate as the door closed. "You might
have, given him one afternoon to dedi
cate to the memory of Miss Dora â
what was her name?"
"She was the rector's daughter down
at Mllldean. Well, I'm really glad! I
fancy she was a flighty girl, Christine."
"Oh, dear me. I hope not," â  said
Christine gravely. "What an escape
for the poor dear boy!"
"Yciu . shan't nut roe .out of temper,"
beamed Kato Raymore.
' "I should think not. when your
machinations are triumphing!"
"He's too nice a boy to be thrown
away. And I don't think he was quite
happy about it."
"I don't suppose he deserved to be.""And now he can "
"Oh* I won't hear any more about it!
As it is, I've heard a lot more than
cjiybody mecnt me to. I suppose." She
pot up. "I must go home." Ehe said,
with a little fro^n. "I'm prlad I came.
I like you and your silly young people.
Kate."
"Ch. no. stay a little." Kate begged.
"I want to ask you about a frock for
Christine was jrlad to talk about
frocksâ :i was the craft whereof she
vas mistressâ and plad. too. to stay a
little longer at the Raymorcs.' There
was youth in the air there, and hope.
The sorrow that was lifting
seemed still to enrich by contrast the
blossoming joy or the young lives
â which had their center there. Her
chaJT covered ro keen a sympathy that
she oould not fafely do anything but
chaff. The thought of the different
state of things which awaited her at
home oid as much to make her linger
as her constitutional dislike of leav
ing a cheery fire for the ttread dusk
vutside. Once she was near confiding
the whole truth to Kate Raymore, so
core a desire had she for sympathy.
But in the ead lit-r habit of reticence
won the day. and she refused to betray
J^erself, just as she had declined to b'f
false to Sibylla's secret. What could
Kate Raymore do for her? To speak
of her trouble would only be to cast
a shadow over the joy of a friendly
heart.
When she did go chance tempted her
to a. very mean action, anil she fell be
fore the temptation without the least
resistance. The lights were not yet
turned up on the staircase or ln the
hall, and Christine. left by her own re
quest to find her way downtsairs,
found the library door open â it grave on
to the hall. The room was not lighted
cither, except By a bright fire. She
eaw two fiprures Fitting by the fire, and
drew back into the gloom of the hall
v.ith a smile on her lips.
Eva was wondering at Jeremy. Of
course he had said nothing of the
news to her; indeed, she knew nothing
explicit of Dora Huttingâ she had
heard only a hint or two from her
mother. But this evening there was
a difference in Jeremy. Hitherto an
oir of hesitation had hung about him;
v.h"n he said anythingâ well, anything
rather markedâ he would often retreat
from !t, or smooth it down, or give it
'fome ordinary (and rather disappoint
ing) explanation in the next sentence.
He alter:irued between letting himself
gr- and bringing; himself up with a jerk.
This demeanor had its interesting side
for Eva. but it had also been rather
disquieting; sometimes it had seemed
almost to rebuke her for listening to
the first sentence without displeasure,
since the first had been open to the in
terpretation which the second so hasti
ly disclaimed. In fact, Jeremy's con
science had kept interposing remarks
between the observations of another
faculty in Jeremy. The result had not
been homogeneous. Conscience spoils
k-ve making ; it should either let it
alone, or in the proper cases prevent it
altogether.
This evening thing's had % changed.
His chagrin ur.d his reliefâ his grudge
against Dora and her curate and his
sense of recovered liberty â joined
forces. He did not let the grass grow
under his feet. He engaged in the
primeval srt of courting without hes
itation or reserve. His eves sjioke in
quick frinnces. his fingers sought ex
'â¢usis for transient toucbes. He criti
cized Eva. obviously meaning praise
uhere with mock audacity he ventured
o.i depreciation. Eva had been work
ing at embroidery â Jeremy must have
the process explained and be shown
how to do it (to be sure it was rather
darkâ they had to lean down together
to get the firelight). His fingers were
very avkward indeed, and needed a
lot of arranging. Eva's clear laugh
rang^ out over this task, and Jeremy
pretended to be very much hurt. Then,
BOddesIjr, Eva paw a line on his hand
and had to tell him what it meant

my enjoyed himself immensely. The
last Â«'hristine saw was when he had
started to tell Eva's fortune and was
holding her hand in his. inventing non
sense, and not inventing it very well.
Well or ill. what did it matter? Old
or new, it mattered- less. The whole
thin? was very old, the process as well
ascertained as the most primitive
method tver used in Jeremy's dyeing
works. "Poor children!" breathed
Christine as she stole softly away to
ward the hall door. She could not
stand there and look on and listen any
more. Not because to listen was mean,
but because it had become intolerable.
She was ready to sob as she let'her
self out silently from the house of love
into the chilly outer air. She left them
to their pleasure and set her face
homeward. But her mind and her
heart were full of what she had seen
â of the beauty and the pity of it; for
must not the beauty be so short lived?
, Had not she, too, known the rapture
of that advancing flood of feeling â
yes, though the flood flowed where it
should not? How the memories came
back â and with what mocking voices
they spoke! Well had it been for her
to stand outside and look! For of a
surety never again might she hope to
enter in.
A man came full beneath the light
of a street lamp. It was a figure she
could never forget nor mistake. It
was Frank Caylesham. He saw her,
and raised his hat, half stopping, wait-
Ing her word to stop. She gave an in
voluntary little cry, almost hysterical.
"Fancy meeting you Just now!" she
gasped
cil\iti:r xix.
In the Corner.
Christine had neither desire to
avoid nor strength to refuse the en
counter. Her emotions had been stir
red by what she had seen at Kate
Raymore's; they demanded some ex
pression. Her heart went forth to a
friend, forgetting any bitterness which
attached to the friendship. The old
attraction claimed her. When Cayle
shum said that it wns quite dark and
there was no reason 'why he should
not escort her she agreed readily and
was .*50on babbling: to him about Eva
p.nd Jeremy. She put her arm in his,
talking merrily and seemed very
young and fresh as rhe turned her
face up to his and Joked fondly about
the y%ntng people. None of the em
barrassment which had afflicted her
visit to his- flat hung about her now.
She had somebody she could talk to
freely at last and was happy in his
eociety. It was a holiday â with a hol
iday's irre-sponsibility about it. He
understood her mood; he was always
quick to understand at the tinie,
though very ready to forget what the
feeling must have been and what it
must continue to be when he had
gone. He shared her tenderness, her
pity and her amusement at the youth
ful venturers. They talked gayly for
a quarter of an hour, Christine not
noticing which way they went. Then
a r>ause came.
Are we going right*" she asked.
"Well, not quite straight home," he
laughed.
"Oh. but we must," she said with a
sigh. He nodded and took a turn
leading more directly to her house.
"I hear things are much better with
John. I met Grantley and he told
me they were In much better shape."
"Thanks to Grantley Imason -and
you. Yes, and you."
"I was very glad to do it Oh. it's
nothing. I can trust old John, you
know." '
"Yes, he'll pay you back. Still it
was good of you." She lifted her eyes
to his. "He knows, Frank," she said.
"The devil he does!" Caylesham was
startled and smiled wryly.
"I don't know -why I told you that
T suppose I had to talk to somebody.
Tes, Harriet Gourtland told him â you
remember she knew.' He made her
angry by lecturing her about Tom
and shp told him."
"He knows, "by Jove, does he?" He
pulled at his mustache! _she pressed
his arm lightly. "But, I say. he's tak
en the money!" He looked at her in
a whimsical perplexity. , .'7 j.v 1
"So you may imagine what It was to
me." -v- "'*
"But he's taken U12 money!"
"How could he refuse it? It would
have meant ruin. Oh, he didn't know
when he sent me to you â he'd never
have done that."
"But he knew when he kept it?"
"Yes, he knew then. He couldn't
let it go when once he'd got it, you
see. Poor old John!"
/ "Well, that's a rum thing!" Cayle
sham's code was infringed by John's
action â that was plain; but his hu
mor was tickled, too. "How did he â
well, how did he take it?"
"Awful!" she answered with a
shiver.
"But I say, you know, he kept the
money, Christine."
"That makes no difference â or
makes it worse. Oh, I can't tell you!" y
"It doesn't make it worse for you
anyhow. It gives you the whip hand,
doesn't it?"
She did not heed him; she was set
on pouring out her own story.
"It's dreadful at home, Frank. Of
course I oughtn't to talk to you, of all
people. But I've had two months and
more of it now."
'He's not unkind to you?" â¢
"If he was what do I deserve? Oh,
don't be fierce. He doesn't throw
things at me, like Harriet Courtland,
or beat me. But I " She burst Into
a little laugh. "I'm stood in the corner
all the time. Frank."
"Poor old Christine!"
"He won't be friends. He keeps me
off. I never touched his hand, or any
thing."
A long-dormant jealousy stirred in
Caylesham.
"Well, do you want to?" he asked
rather brusquely.
"Oh, that's all very well, but imagine
living like that! There's nobody to
speak to. I'm in disgrace. He doesn't
talk about it, but he talks round it, you
know. Sometimes he forgets for five
minutes. Then I say something cheer
ful. Then he remembers . and â and
tends me back to my corner." Her
rueful laugh was not far from a sob.
"It's awfully humiliating," she ended,
"and â and most frightfully dull."
"But how can he ?
"One good scene would have been so
much more endurable. But all day and
every day!"
Caylesham was amused, vexed, ex
asperated. â¢
"But, good heavens, it's not as if it
was an ordinary case. Remember what
he's done! Why do you stand.it?"
"How tan I help it? I did the thing,
didn't I?"
His voice rose a little in his im
patience. .'"â "â â¢*Â»â¢
"But he's taken my money. He's
living on it. It's saved him. By gad,
how can he say anything to you after
that? Haven't you got your answer?
Why don't you remind him gently of
that?"
"That would hurt him so dreadfully."
" "Well, doesn't he hurt you?"
'He'd never be friends with me
again."
"He doesn't seem particularly friend
ly now."
"I feel quite friendly to him. I want
to be friends." f
"It does you credit then," he said
with a sneer.-
She pressed his arm lightly again,
pleading against his anger and his un
wonted failure to understand.
"It would be an end of all hope if I
threw the money in his teeth. He's un
happy enough about it as it is." She
looked up as she added, "I've got to
live with him, you know, Frank."
Caylesham gave her a curious quick
glance.
"Got to live with him?"
"Yes; all my life." she answered. "I
suppose you hadn't \hought of that?"
It was not the sort of thing which
Caylesham was in the habit of think
ing about, but he tried to follow her
view.
"Yes. of course. It would be better to
be friends. But you shouldn't let him
get on stilts. It's absurd, after what
he's done. I mean â I mean he's done a
much qut?erer thing than you have."
"Poor old John! How could he help
it?"
He glanced at her sharply and was
about to speak, when she cried, "Why,
where are we? I didn't notice where
we -wore going."
"We're just outside my rooms. Come
in for a bit."
"No, I can't come in. I'm late now.
andâ andâ really I'm ashamed to tell
even you! Well, I'm always questioned
where I've been. I have to give an ac
count of every place. I have to stand
with my hands, behind me and give an
account of all my movements, Frank."
He whistled gently and compassion
ately.
"Like a school girl!"
"How well you follow the metaphor,
Frank! So I can't come in. I'll go
home. No, don't you come."
"I'll come a bit farther with you.
Oh, It's quite dark." *â¢,. V:
"Well, not arm-in-arm!"
"But doesn't that look more respect
able?"
"You're entirely incurable," she said,
with her old pleasure in him all re
vived.
"It's Infernal nonsense," he went on.
"Just you stand up for yourself. It's
absolute humbug in him. He's de
barred himself from taking up any
such attitude â just as much as he. has
from making any public row about it.
Hang it, he can't have it both ways,
Christine!"- v.vV
"I've got to live with him, Frank."
"Oh. you said that bafore."
"And I'm very fond of him."
'What?" He turned to her in a
genuine surprise and an obvious vexa
tion.
"Yes, very. I always was. We used
to spar, but we were good friends. We
don't spar now; I wish we did. It's
Just iciness. But I'm very fond of
him."
"Of course, if you feel like that **"â¢
"I always felt like that, even â even;
long ago. I used to tell you I did. I
suppose you thought that humbug?"
"Well, ' it wouldn't have been very
strange if I had."
"No, I suppose not. It must have
looked like .that. But it was true â and
it is true. The only thing I've got
left to care much about in life is get
ting to be friends with John againâ and
I don't suppose I ever shall." Her
voice fairly broke for a moment.
"That's what upset me so much when
I saw those silly children at Kate Ray
more's."
C/tylcsham looked at her. There was
a roguish twinkle in his eye, but he >
patted her hand in a very friendly'
sympathy.
"I say, old John's cut me out after
all!" he whispered.
"You're scandalous! You alyvays
were," she said, smiling. "The way
you put things was always disreput
able. Yes, it was, Frank. But no; it's
not poor old John who's cut you out â
or Ht least It's John in a particular
capacity. Life's 1 cut you outâ John as
life. John, as life, has cut you o*ut of
my life â and now I've got to live with
John, you see."
Caylesham screwed up his mouth
ruefully. Things certainly seemed to
shape that way. She had to live with
John.. John's conduct might be un
reasonable and unjustifiable, but people
who must be lived with frequently
presume on that circumstance and be
have as they would not venture to
behave if livlns with them were op
tional. John really had not , a : leg to
stand on, if it came to ah argument.
But arguing with people you have to
live with does not conduce to the com
fort of living: .with them â especially if
; you get the, better of the argument.
He was exceedingly sorry for Christine,
b'i|t ha didn't see any way out of it for
hit.
"Of course ther's a funny side to it,"
she said with a little laugh.
"Oli/ycs. there Is," he admitted. "But
It's deuced rough luck on you."
"Everything's deuced rough luck."
She mimicked his tone daintily. "And
I don't suppose it's ever anything worse
with you, Frank! It was deuced rough
luck ever meeting you, you know. And
sd It wan that John wanted money and
sent me to you. And that Harriet's got
a temper, and, I suppose, that we've
got to be punished for our sins." She
took her arm out of his â she had
slipped , it in again while she talked
about John as life. "And here I am,
just at home, andâ and the corner'*
waiting for me, Frank."
"I'm devilish sorry, Christine."
"Yes, I'm sure you are. You always
meant to be kind. Frank,- if ever I do
make friends with John, be glad, won't
you?"
"I think he's behaved like aâ" â 
"Hush, hush!* You've always been
prosperousâ and you've never been
good." She laughed and took his hand.
"So don't say anything against poor
old John."
"I tell you whatâ you're a brick,
Christine. Well, good-by, my dear."
"Good-by, Frank. I'm glad I met
you. I've got some of it out, haven't 1?
Don't worry â well, no, you won't â and
If I succeed do try to be glad. And'
never a word to show John that I've
told you he knows!"
"I shall do just as you like about
that. Good-by, Christine."
He left her a few yards from her
house, and she stood by the door
watching his figure till it disappeared
In the dark. He had done her so much
harm. He was not a good friend. But
he was good to talk to and very kind
in his indolent, careless way. If you
recalled yourself to him he was glad to
see you and ready to be talked to'. " A
momentvof temptation came upon her
âthe temrtation to throw up every
thing, as Tom Courtland had thrown
everything up, to abandon the hard
task, to rive up trying for the only
thing she*vanted. But Caylesham had
given her no such' invitation. He did
not want herâ that was the plain Eng-
lish of itâ and she did not want him in
the end either. She had loved the thing
and still loved the memory of it; but
she did not desire it again, because in
it there was no peace. She wanted a
friend â and John would not be one. No
body wanted her â except John; and be
cause he wanted her he was so hard
to her. But Frank Caylesham had been
in his turn too hard on John. She was
the only person who could realize John's
position and make allowances for him.
Yet all the light died out of her face as
she entered her home.
John was waiting for her. His mind
was full of how well things were going
in the city. In the old days this would
have been one of their . merry, happy,
united evenings. He would have told
her of his success and "stood" a dinner
and a. play, and brought her home in
the height of glee and good companion
ship, laughing at her sharp sayings and
admiring her dainty little face. All-thi3
was just what he wanted to do now,
and his life was as arid as hers for
want of the comradeship. But he would
not forgive; it seemed neither possible
nor self-respecting. That very weak
point in his case, with which Caylesham
had dealt so trenchantly/ made him a
great stickler for.. self-respect; nothing
must be doneâ nothing moreâ to make
her, think that he condoned her offense
or treated it lightly. It was part of her
punishment to hear nothing of the re
newed prosperity in the city, to know
nothing. of .his thoughts or his doings,
to bi locked out of his heart. This was
one side: the other was that obligation
to make full disclosure of all she did,
and of how her time was spent. She
must be, made to feel the thing In
these two ways every day. Yet he con
sidered'that he was treating her very
mercifully; .he .was anxious to do that,
because he was all the time in his heart
afraid that she would throw Cayle
sham's money â the money which was
bringing the renewed prosperityâ In his
face. ;
She faced the punishment with her
usual .courage and her unfailing humor.
There was open; irony in the mi
nuteness with which she catalogued
I - . â¢ â  . '
THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALLl
her day's doings; she did not sit down,
but stood on the other side of his writ
ing table, upright and with her hands
.actually behind herâ because she -liked
the school girl parallel which Cayle
sham had drawn. John saw the humor
and felt the irony, but he was helpless.
She did what she was told; he could
not control' the manner in which she
did it.
"And then I walked home â yes, walk
ed. Didn't take a bu3, or a tram, or a
steam engine. I just walked \ on my
two, legs, going about three miles an
hour, and â o'h, yesâ taking one .wrong
turn which makes me five minutes later
than I ought to be. Quite a respecta
ble turnâ Just out of the way, that's all.
May I go and get myself some tea?"
He did so want to tell her about the
successes in. the city. And in fact he
admired the courage* and liked the
irony. They were her own, and of her.
Doing justice was very-hard, with that
â provoking dainty face at once resent
ing and mocking at it. But justice
must be done; his grievance should not
be belittled. .
"I'm not stopping you getting your
self tea. Is it a crime to ask where" my
fife's been?"
It's mere prudence, I'm sure. Only
what makes you think I should tell you
the truth?"
She. had her tea now â a second tea â
and was sipping it leisurely.
"At any rate I know your account,
and if I heard anything different "
â¢ "That's the method? .\\ see. '.' Her
tone softened. â¢ "Don't \leUs
What's the^good? Had a good day' in
the city?"- , â¢:â¢â¢.
"Just like other days," grunted John.
"Nothing particular?" â¢ ,
"No." . :
"There never is now, is there?"
He made no answer. Opening the
evening paper, he began to read tit.
Christine knew what that meant.'^ Sav
ing what was unavoidable, he would
talk' to her no more that: night. ' t ;"â â 
The wound to her vanity, her thwart*
ed affection, her sense of the absurdity
of such a way of living together, all
combined to urge her to take Cayle
sham's view of the position, and to act
lipon.itâ to make the one reply, the one
defense, which was open to her. .-The
very words Vhich she would use came
into her. mind as she sat opposite to
John at dinner. Living on Caylesham's
generority â it would be scarcely an ex
aggeration to say that. And from. what
motive came the bounty? It would not
be hard to find wordsâ stinging words â
to. define that. John could have no an
swer to them;they must shame him to
the. soul. At every sullen short word,
at every obstinate punitive silence,, the
temptation grew upon her. Knowing
that she knew all, how could he have
the effrontery to behave in this fash
ion? She steeled herself to the fight;
she was ready for it by the time dinner
was done and they were left alone,
John sitting in glum muteness as he
drank his port, Christine in her smart
evening frock, - displaying a prettmess
which won no approving glances now.
It was insufferableâ she would do it!
Ah, but poor old John! He had been
through so \many worries, he had so
narrowly escaped dire calamity. He had
been forced Into a position so terrible.
And they had | been through so many
things together; they had been com
rades in fair and foul weather. . What
would be the look in. his | eyes when , he
heard that taunt from her? He would
say little, since there would, be little
to say â but he would give her a look
of such hopeless fierce misery. No;
in the end she was responsible for the
thing, and she murt bear the burden
of it. Caylesham's view might be;, the
man's view, perhaps the right view for
a man to take. It could not be the
woman's; the wife was not justified in
looking at it like that. . No, she couldn't
"do it. ,-'â  -V y.} .:"-â  â â  \ . ':. 'V'-
But neither could- she go on living
like this. .Her. eyes rested thoughtfully
on him.' He was looking tired and Told.
Poor old John! ;f He wanted livening up,
some merriment, -'a little playful petting
to VwhichV he ..might â¢ respond ; in his
roughly jocose, affectionately 'i homely
fashionâ with his "old girl" and "old
lady" and so on. He never called her
"old girl" now. Would she hate it as
much now? She longed for it extraor
dinarily, since it would mark happiness
and forgetfulness Ln him. But it
seemed as if she would never hear it
again. Suddenly she broke out with a
passionate Question: .
"Are we to live like "this always?"
He did not seem startled; he an
swered slowly and ponderously; *"What
have vou to complain of? Do I say
anything?. Do I reproach you? Have I
made a- row? Look at .what I might
have done! Some people would think
you were very lucky."
"It makes you miserable as well as
me."
"You should have thought of all that
before." * , . â¢
He. took out a cigar and lit it, then
turned his chair ' half ' way . round from
the tableland began to read his paper
again. - Christine could not bear it; she
began to sob softly. He took no visi
ble notice of hÂ»r; his eyes were fixed
on a paragraph and' he was reading
it over and over again, not following
in the least' what it meant. She rose
and walked toward the door; he re
mained motionless. â¢ She came back to
ward him in a hesitating way.
"I want to speak to you," she said,
choking, down her sobs and regaining
composure. r ' Â»
He looked up now. There was fear in
his eyes, a hunted look which went to
her heart." At the least Invitation she
would have thrown herself on her_
knees by 'him and sought every. means
to comfort him. She was thinking only
of him now, and had forgotten Chyles
ham's gay attractiveness. And in face
of that look in his eves she could not
say a word about Caylesham's money.
"I'm going away for a little while,
John, I'm gpir.g to ask Sibylla to'let
me come down to Milldean for a bit."
"What do you want to go away for?"
"A change of air," she answered^
smiling decisively. "I can't bear this,
you know. It's . intolerable â ami . it's
absurd." . n ,
Â«l'Am I to blame for it?" '
"I'm not talking about who's to
blame. But I must go away." â Â£:Â£-.
"How long do you want to stay
away?".
"Till you want me back â till you ask
me to .come back.'' He looked at her
questioningly. "It must be one thing
or the other," she went on.
"It's, for me to decide what it shall
be."
"Yes; which of the two possible
things. It's for you to decide that. But
this state of things isn't possible. If
you don't want me back, well, we must
make arrangements, rlf you ask me to
come back, you'll mean that you want
to forget all this wretchedness and be
really friends. Her feeling broke out.
"Yes, friends again," she repeated,
holding her arms out toward. him.
"You seem to think things are very
easily forgotten," he growled. s
, "God knows I don't^think so," she
said. "Do you really think that's what
I've learnt from life. John?"
"At any rate I've got to forget them
pretty easily!"
. She would hot trust herself to argue,
lest in the heat of contention the one
forbidden weapon 'should leap into her
hand. ,
"We can neither of. us forget. But
there's another thing," he said.
He would not give up his idea, his
theory of what she deserved and of
what morality demanded.
"You may go for a visit. I shall Â«x
pect you back in two or three weeks."
., : "Not?;back to this," she insisted. _.
He shrugged . his shoulders and held
the : paper up ;. between ' them.
" "If . you : don't want me back, well, I
shall -understand, that. But I shan't
comeback to this." She walked to. the*
door. and looked b,ack; she could > not
see , his ; face ; for the paper. , She made
a' little despairing .movement, with her
hands, but turned away again without
saying more and stole quietly out of
the room.
John Fanshaw dashed "his paper to
the ground and sprang to his feet. He
gave a long sigh. He had been In
mortal terrorâ he thought she was go-
Ing to talk about the money. That
peril was past. He flung his hardly
lighted cigar into the grate and walked
up and down the room in a frenzy of
unhappiness. Yes, that peril was past
âshe had said nothing. But he knew
it was in her heart; and he knew how
It must appear to her. Heavens, did
it not appear like that to him? But
ehe should never know that he felt like
that about it. That would be to give
up his grievance, to abandon his su
periority, to admit that there was little
or nothing to choose between themâ
between her, the sinner, and him, who
profited by the sin, whose salvation
the sin had" been, who knew, it had
been his salvation and had accepted
salvation from <it. No, no; he must
never acknowledge that. He must stick
to his position. It was monstrous to
think he would own that his guilt was
comparable to hers.
He sank back Into his chair again
and looked round the empty room. He
thought of Christine upstairs, alone
tco. What a state of things! "Why
did she? My God, why did she?" he
muttered, and then fell to lashing him
self once more into a useless fury,
pricking his anger lest it should sleep,
setting imagination to work on recol
l?ction, torturing himself, living again
through the time of her treachery, elab
orating all his grievance â lest by
chance she should seem less of a sin
ner than before, lest by chance his own
art should loom too large, lest by
chance he might be weak and open his
heart and find forgiveness for his wife
and comrade.
"By God, she had no excuse!" he
muttered, striking the table with his
fist. "And Iâ why. the thing was set
tled before I knew. It was. settled, I
say!" Then he thought that If things
went on doing well he would be able to
pay Caylesham sooner than the letter
of his bond demanded. Then, when he
had paid -Caylesham off â ah, then the
superiority would be in no danger,
there would be no taunt to fear. Why,
yes, he would pay Caylesham off quite
soon. Because things were going so
well. Now, to-day, in the city, what
a stroke he had made! If he were to
tell Christine thatâ! For a moment
he smiled, thinking how she would pat
his cheek and say. "Clever old John!"
in her pretty half-derisive way; how
she would â
He broke off with a groan. No, by
heaven, he'd tell her nothing! His life
was nothing to herâ thanks to what
she's done â to what she had done. Oh,
he did well to be angry!â Even to think
of what she had doneâ!
So he struggled, lest perchance for
giveness and comradeship should win
the day.
CHAPTER XX.
The Hour of Wrath.
As soon as the first shot was fired
Tom Courtland struck his flag. There
was no fight in him. His career was
compromised, and *by now his affairs
were seriously involved. He resigned
his seat; he wasn't goins to wait to be
turned out, he said, either by divorce
or by bankruptcy, or by both at once.
He never went home now. As a last
concession to appearances, he took a
room at his c'.ub. Airs. Bolton now
ursed him to fightâ since things had
Cone so far. Of course he would have
to tell lies; but there were ,circum
stances in which everybody told lies.
She was ready to back him through
thick and thin. If they could get Lady
Harriet into the box and cross-examine
her thoroughly, they could rely on a
great deal of sympathy from a jury of
husbands.' It was really a. good fight
ing caseâ given the lies, of course. She
urged" fighting, -which was unselfish of
her from one point of view, since an
undefended case would do her little
real harm, while a cross-examination
in open court could not be a pleasant
ordeal for her, any more than it ought
to be for Harriet Courtland. But she
liked Tom â although incurable habit
had caused her to make his affairs so
involvedâ and she hated that Harriet
should "have a walkover." She was an
gry with Tom because he gave in di
rectly, and took it all "lying down." as
she said. But Tom was broken; he
could "only, mutter that he did not
"care a damn" what they did; it was
all over for him. . His bristly hair be
gan to turn a dull gray in these trou
blesome days. When he was not with
Mrs. Bolton he was haunting -, the
streets and parks, hoping he might
meet his girls taking their walk with
the maid or with Suzette Bligh. Such
stray encounters were his only chance
of seeing them now â the only chance of
ever seeing them in the future, he sup
posed, unless the court . gave him "ac
cess." And much pleasure there would
be in access, with Harriet to tell them
the sort of man he was before every
*uch visit as the law might charingly
dole out to him! He grumbled discon
solately about everything â the suit, his
affairs, his children, the access, all of
itâ to Mrs. Bolton, but he did and at
tempted nothing. He was in a condi
tion of moral collapse.
Harriet Courtland's state was even
worse. She was almost unapproach
able by the children and Suzette Bligh
â -and none other tried to approach her.
She had no friends left. Not -one of
Tom's set was on her side; she had
wearied them all out. The last to keep
up the forms of friendship had been
Christine Fanshaw. -Now that was at
an end, too. She had heard nothing
from Christine. From the day of
John's visit there had been absolute
silence. She knew well what that
meant # She brooded fiercely over what
she had done to Christineâ her one re
maining friend â had done not because
she wanted to hurt Christine or to lose
her friendship, had done with no rea
sonable motive at all, but just in blind
rage, because In her fury she wanted
to strike and wound John, and this had
been the readiest and sharpest *veapon.
She could not get what she had done
out of her head; she was driven to see
what a light it cast on the history of
her own home: it showed her the sort
of woman she was. But she held on
her way, and pressed on her suit.
Realizing what she was bred in her no
desire to change. There . was no
changing such a woman as she
wasâ a crushed woman, as â¢ she
called herself again, and again.. So
there she sat, alone in her room,
save when her nervous children
came perforce to cower before her â alone
in the ruin she had made, in bitter
wrath with all -about her, in bitterest
wrath with herself. She was a terror
in the house and knew it. Nobody in
the house loved her nowâ nay, nobody
in the world. It had come to this be
cause of her evil rage. And the rage
was not satiated; it had an appetite
still for every misfortune and every
shame which was to afflict and dis
grace her husband. In that lay now
her only pleasure;* her so-le joy was
to give paini. Yet the thought that her
girls had ceased to love her, or had
come to hate her. drove her to a frenzy
of anger and wretchedness. What had
they to complain of? How dared they
not love her? She exacted signs of love
from them. They dared not refuse a
kiss for fear of a blow being given in
its place; but Harriet knew now why
they kissed her and accepted her kisses.
"Little hypocrites," she would* mut
ter when they went out, accusing the
work of her own hands. But they
should love her â aye, and they should
hate their father. She swore they
should at least hate their father, even
if they only pretended to love her. The
woman grew half mad at the idea that
in their hearts they loved their father,
pitied, him. thought him ill used,
grieved because he came no more; that
they were in their hearts on 'their
father's side and against her. She
wished they were older so that they
could be told all about the case. Well,
they shoukkbe told even now, if need
be, if that proved - the only way of
rooting the love of their father out
of their hearts.
An evil case for these poor children!
They had no comfort save in gentle
colorless Suzette Bligh. To all her
friends she had seemed a superfluous
person. She used to be invited Just to
balance dinner parties, or on a stray
impulse of kindness. But fate had
found other work for her now. The
once superfluous woman was all the
consolation these three children had;
any love they got she gave them. She
stood between them and desolation. She
warned them what te nper their mother
was in, whether it were safe to ap
proach her, and with wliat demeanor.
More than once her love gave the
meek creature courage, and she stood
between them and wrath. Lamentable
as the state of affairs was, Suzette had
found a new joy in life. She took these
children into her life and her heart,
and became as a mother to them. Grad
ually they grow to love her.
But none the lessâ perhaps all the
more â they tormented her, bringing to
her all the doubts and questions which
were ri$c in their minds. The porten
tous worc^'dlvorce" had come to their
earsâ Harriet was not careful in her
use of it. They connected It quickly
with their father's now continuous ab
sence. Whatever else it might mean â
and they thought it meant something
bad for their father, to be suffered at
the hands of their motherâ they under
stood it at least to mean that he would
be with them no more. Suzette knew
nothing at all about "access," and
could only fence feebly with, their
questions; they ventured to put none
to Harriet. They grew clear that their
father had gone, and that they were to
be left to their mother.
One and all they declined such a coo*
elusion. They loved Tom; â¢ they did
not love Harriet. Tom had always
been a refuge, sometimes a buffer. They
had no doubt of what they wanted.
They wanted to go to their father, and
to take Suzette Bligh with them. That
scheme conjured up the vision of a
happy' home, free from fear, where
kisses would be volunteered, not ex
acted, and the constant dread would
be nt> more.
"But we daren't tell mamma that."
said Sophy, in a tremble at the bare
idea::
Lucy shook her head; Vera's
eyes grew wide. They certainly
dared not go to Harriet with any
such communication as that. They
had been shrewd enough to see that
they were expected to hate their father.
Vera had been roughly turned out of
the room merely for mentioning hi3
name.
After much consultation, carried on
In a secrecy to which not even Suzette
was privy, a pian was laid. Thay would
write to their father and tell him that,
whether he were sentenced to divorce
cr not, they wanted to come and live
with himâ and to bring Suzette if they
might.
"We â¢ won't say anything about
mamma. He'll understand." Sophy ob
served.
Vera piped out in terror:
"But when mamma finds out?"
"We shall be gone, don't you see?"
cried Lucy. "We shall ask papa, to
meet us somewhere and he'll take us
with him and then just write and tell
mamma."
"He can say we're sorry when he
writes to tell mamma."
"Oh, yes, I see," said Vera. "It will
be splendid, won't it? I wish we could
tell Suzette!"
The elder girl3 were dead against
that. Suzette was a dear, but she was
tÂ«o much afraid of mamma; the great
secret would no 4 be safe with her and
if it were discovered before they were
out of reach â significant nods expressed
that situation with absolute lucidity.
So Sophy â who wrote the best hand
squared her elbows and sat down to
her task in the schoolroom. A scout
was posted at the foot of the stairs,
another at the top. On the least alarm
the letter was to be destroyed and. the
scribe would be discovered busy on a
French exercise.
"Dearest papa," Sophy wrote, "we all
send our love and, please, we do not
want to stay here now that you have
gone away. Please let us come and
live with you. We promise not to be
troublesome and Suzette might come,
too, might not she, and look after us?
Dearest papa, do not make us stay
here. Because we love you and we
van^jo come and live with you. Please
tell us where to meet you and we win
make Suzette bring 41s and you can
take us home with you. Please let it
be soon. We do so want to see you.
Please do not make us stay here. We
each of us send you a kiss and are
your loving daughters."
The signatures were attached, the
letter closed and addressed to Tom's
club; they knew where that was, be
cause he had taken them to see it one
Sunday morning and they had admired
the great armchairs and all the won
derful big books. The same afternoon
Lucy broke away from SUzette. ran
across to a pillar post and dropped the
important missive in. She came back
with an air of devil-may-care triumph,
nodding at her sisters, frankly refusing
to tell Suzette anything about it. \
"You'll see Very soon," she promised
in mysterious triumph, and that even
ing the three had a wonderful talk over
the letter, speaking in low cautious
tones, agreeing that their manner must
be carefully guarded, that meekness
and affection toward their mother must
be tha order of the day and that ona of
them must always be on the watch for
the postman's coming, lest by chance
Tom's answer should fall Into the
hands of the enemy.
"Would she open It?" shuddered
Vera.
I expect she would." said Sophy.
They saw the danger and the hours
were anxious. But they tasted some
of the delights of conspiracy, too. And
hope was on the horizon. One more
"row " could be endured if after that
tho doora were open to freedom.
Tom's heart was touchsd by tha
little scrawl, written on a sheet torn
from a copy book. In his broken
down â  state he was inclined to
be maudlin over it. He carried
it to Mrs. Bolton and showed it to her.
saying that he could not be such a bad"
chap after all if the little ones loved
him like that, pitying them because
they were exposed to Harriet's tempera,
bewailing his own inability to help them
or to comply with their artless request.
"I shouldn't be allowed to keep
them," he said ruefully, trying to
smooth his bristly hair.
Mrs. Bolton made a show of sympa
thy, and was in fact sorry for him.
but she did not encourage any idea of
trying to take or keep them. He sug
gested smuggling them out of the Ju
risdiction. She was firm, if kindly, in
asking how he meant to support them.
Anyhow Lady Harriet could feed them!
Tom waa very much under her influ
ence and had no longer the strength of
will needed for any venturous plan.
The conclusion that he could do noth
ing was not long in coming home to
him.
"Bat I must write to the poor little
things," he said, "and tell them I shall
come and see them sometimes. That'll
comfort them. I'm glad they're so fond
of me. By Jove. I haven* t been a bad
father, you know!" He* read Sophy's
letter over again and laid it down on
Mrs. Bolton's mantelpiece. When he
went back to the club he forgot it and
left it there.
There Mrs. Bolton's friend. Miss Pat
tie Henderson (she was not married, to
Georgie Parmer.ter yetâ negotiations
were pending with his family) found it.
and it was from her that a suggestion
came which appealed strongly to Mrs.
Bolton. As she drank her glass of port
Miss Henderson opined that it would be"a rare score" to send the letter to Har
riet Courtland. "It'll make her properly
furious," said Miss Pattie, finishing
her port with hearty enjoyment.
Mrs. Bolton caught at the notion.
Harriet was putting her to a great deal
of annoyance, and so was Tom's re
fusal to stand up tc Harriet. It was
meet and right that any person who
was in a position to give Harriet a dig
rhould give it. Neither of them thought
of what might be entailed on the little
folk who had dared to send the letter;
in the end they, had a very Inadequate
idea of the terror Harriet inspired. Mrs.
-Bolton laughed as she contemplated the
plan.
"Just stick in a word or two of your
own," Miss Pattie advised. "Something
spicy!"
Mrs. Bolton at once thought of sev
eral spicy little comments which would
add i>oin4 to Sophy's letter. One was
so spicy, so altogether satisfying to
Mrs. Bolton's soul and to Miss Pattie
Henderson's critical taste, that It was
Irresistible. Itâ and Sophy's letter
were posted to Harriet before lunch
that day. and Mrs. Bolton's eyes were
only opened at all to what she had
done when she told Caylesham (who
had dropped in In the afternoon) and
heard him exclaim:
"But, by Jove, she'll take It out of
thcie unhappy children, you know! I
cay, you don't know Harriet Courtland
or you'd never have don* that!"
His concern seemed so great that
Mrs. Bolton's heart was troubled. If
she did not upbraid herself, at any rate
Ehe denounced Miss Hendarson. But
what was to be done? Nothing could
be done. By now the letter must be al
ways in Harriet Courtland's hands.
Caylesham said a few plain words about
the matter, but hi* words could not
help now. They had. however, one ef
fectâthey made Mrs. Bolton afraid to
let Tom know what she had done, and
che persuaded Cayleiham not to betray
her. When Tom next came she told
him that she had accidentally burned
Sophy's letter in mistake for one of her
own.
"Well, I've sent them an answer.
poor little beggarsâ under cover to Su
zette Bligh," said Tom. "But I'm sor
ry. I should have liked to keep that
letter of theirs. Flora."
"I know. Of course you would. I'm
eorry," said Mrs. Bolton, now feeling
very uncomfortable, although she had
not lost her pleasure at the idea of giv
ing Harriet such a fine dig.
Tom's letter reached its destination
first, and Suzette read it to the little
girls. He told them to behave well to
ward their mother, and to love her. He
said he was obliged to be away from
them now, but presently he would see
them and hoped to eee them very often,
and that they were not to forget to go
on loring him, because he loved them
very much.
Suzette's voice broke a little over the
letter, and the children listened in an
Intent and rather awed silence. They
were divided between relief tbat an an
swer had come safely, and depression
at what the answer was. But they un
derstood â or thought they didâ that if
they were good they would presently be
allowed to see their father very often.
â¢That's what he means, isn't it?"
Lucy asked Suzette.
"Yes, dear, that's it," Suzette told
her, not knowing what elsa to tell her.
-We'd better burn papa's letter."
Sophy suggested.
â¢ihere was- no difference of opinion
about tlutt. Vera was accorded the
privilege of putting it in the fire, and
of stamping carefully on the ashes aft
erward.
"Because," she said, justifying this
precaution, "you remember the story
where the man was found out Just be
cause he didn't stamp on it after he'd
burnt it, Sophy!"
â¢'This was the last day on which
Tom Courtland was entitled to put a
defense to his wife's suit. He bad made
no sign. Harriet was the fiercer against
him. His ruin was not enough; she de
sired herself to see it made visible and
embodied in a trial whose every word
and proceeding should aggravate his
Ehame and satisfy her resentment. She
had nursed the thought of thato mak
ing pictures or him and of the woman
undergoing the ordeal and being brand
ed with guilt while all the world looked
on. Now Tom refused her this delight;
there would be no trial, because he
would not fight.
It was a fine moment for the letter to
arrive. The mine was all laid, only the
match was wanting. Harriet was
dressing for dinner when it came; her
maid Garrett was doing her hair beforfe
the glass. As she read, Garrett saw a
sudden change come over her face â one
quick flush, then a tight ratting of her
lips. Garrett knew the signs by expe
rience. Something in that letter had
upset her ladyship. Warily and gently
Garrett handled her ladyship's hair; if
she blundered in her task now, woe to
her, for her ladyship's temper was up
set- â¢
"Dearest papa, do not make us stay
here. Because we love you and we
want to come and live with you" â
'Please do not make us stay here."
"That was the truth of Ht. that was
what they really thought, those little
hypocrites, who came and kissed her
so obediently every morning and even
ing, those meek little creatures with
their "Yes, mamma dear," "No, dear
mamma," accepting all her commands
so docilely, returning her kisses so af
fectionately! All that w&s a show, &
sham, a device for deluding her, fpi
kepping her quiet, while they laid their
vile plots â none the less vile for being
eo idiotic â and sent their love to "dear
est pppa" â to that man, to Flora Bol
ton's lover â while they gave Flora Bol
ton the means of mocking and of tri
umphing over hÂ«r.
She sat very still for awhile, but Gar
rett was not reassured. Garrett "knew
that the worst fits of all, took a little
time in coming. They worked them
selves up gradually.
"Is that to your ladyship's satisfac
tion?" asked Garrett as- she put the
laEt touches to her work. v
"No. it isn't," snarled Harriet. "No,
don't touch me again. Let it alone,
you clumsy fool."
Garrett went and took up the even
ing dress. Harriet Courtland rosa and
eiood for a moment with Sophy's let
ter to Torn in her hand.
"I'm going to the schoolroom for Â«a
few minutes. Wait here," Bhe said to
Garrett. and walked out of the room
slowly, taldns the letter with her. An
other slip of paper ehe tore into Bhreds
as she vent; that was Mrs. Bolton's
comment on the situation, as "spicy"
and as vulsar as EhÂ«s and Miss Pattie
Henderson could make it. Yet Har
j Jet was not now thinking of Mrs. Bol
ton.
Garrett stood where she was for a
moment, then stole cautiously after her
mistress. She knew the signs, and a
morb'.d curiosity possessed her. She
would have a sensational story to re
tail downstairs, if she could manage to
see or hear what happenedâ for beyond
a doubt something had put her lady
ship in cue of her tantrums. Pity for
the children struggled with Garrctt's
seductive anticipations of aÂ«Vscene.".
Suzette Bligh was reading a story
aloud in the schoolroom when Harriet
marched in. She held the letter in her
hand. The children could make, and
had leisure to make, no conjecture how
the catastrophe had come about, but in
a flash all the little girls knew that it
was upon them. The letter and their
mother's face told them. Thev sat
looking at her with terrified eyes. <
"So you don't want to stay here?"
she eald sneeringly. "You want "to go
to your dearest papa? And you dare
to write that! Who wrote it? Was it
you, Lucy?"
"Iâ I didn't write it, mamma dear,"
siad Lucy. . : â¢'
Suzette rose in -distress.
"Dear Lady Harriet â " she began.
"Hold your tongue. So you wrote it,
Sophy? Yes, I see now it's your writ
ing. Oh, but you were alt in it, I sup
pose? So you love your papa. â¢â¢
â¢ Garrett had stolen to within two, or
three yards of the door -now, and it
stood half open. She could hear all and
see something of what happened.'
"So you love your papa?" '-
Eophy had most courage. Desperate
courage came to her now.
"Yes. we do."
"And vou want to go to him?"
"Yes, mamma."- - . â :
. "And you don't love me* You don't
want to stay with me?"
Sophy glanced for a moment at her
sisters.
"Papa's so kind to us," she said.- ; â¢;-
"And I'm not kind?" asked Harriet
with a sneering laugh. "When you're
older, mv dears, you'll thank mi for
having been kindâ really kind. It's
really kind to teach you to play, these
tricksâ these mean disgraceful little
tricks."
All the children rose slowly and
shrank back. They tried to gÂ«t be
hind Suzette Bligh. Harriet laughed
again when Bhe saw the maneuver.
"You needn't stay, Suxette/' she said.
"I know how to manage my '.own chil
dren." ':-j-.;, v
Suzette was verv white, and was
trembling all over; It seemed as If her
legs would hardlv support her.
"What are you going to do?"
"It's no business of yours. . They
know very well. Leave me alone with
them."
It was a terrible moment for timid
Suzette. But love of the children had
laid hold of her heart a"nd gave her
strength.
"I can't go. Lady Harriet," she said
in a low voice. "I can't leave you alone
with them â not now." â 
"Not now?" cried Harriet fiercely.
"You'reâ you're not calni now. You're
not fitâ "â¢
"You'd stand between, me and my
own children?" :â â¢â '
"Dear Lady Harriet, Iâ I can't go
away now." For she remembered so
vividly all that the children's reminis
cences, their nods . and â nudges, had .
hinted to her; she realized all the
things which they had not told her;
and she would not leave them now.
Her resistance set the crown to Har
riet Courtland's rage. After an in
stant's pause she gave a half articulate
cry of anger and rushed forward.* .Su r
zette tried to gather the children be
hind her. and to thrust the angry wo-,
man away- But Harriet caught Sophy
by the arm and lifted her midway' in
the air. Garrett came right up to the
door and peeped through.
"So you, love papa and not me??
Sophy turned h^r. pale,. terrified little
face up to her mother's. The worst
had happened and the truth came out.
"No, we â we. hate you. . You're cruel
to us; .we hate you and- we love papa;"
Harriet's grip tightened on the child's
armsâ Sophy's very audacity kept her
still for a moment. But at the next
she lifted her higher in the air. Suzette
sprang forward with a cry, and Gar
rett dashed into the room, shrieking,
"Don't, don't, my lady!"
They were too late. The child was
flung violently down; her head struck
the iron fender; she rolled over and
lay quite stljl, bleeding from the" fore
head. Suzette and Garrett caught Har
riet Courtland by the arms. A low
frightened weeping came from the
other two little girls. .â
Harriet stood for a moment in the^
grasp of the two women who soughf
to restrain her and would have thrown
themselves upon her had she tried to
move. But restraint was no more nec
essary. Sophy had ransomed her sis
ters, and lay so quiet, bleeding from
the head. In a loud voice Harriet-
Courtland cried, "Have I killed her?
Oh, my God!" and herself broke into a
tempest of hysterical sobbing. She fell
back Into Garrett's arms, shuddering, ,
weeping, now utterly collapsed.
Suzette went and knelt by Sophy.
"No, she's not dead, but it's no fault
of yours." she said. , â¢'
Harriet wrenched free from Garrett
and flung herself on. her knees by the
table, stretching her arms across ic
and beating her forehead on the wood.
The two children looked at her, won
dering and appalled.
CHAPTER XXI.
An Uncompromising Expression.
On the morning of her attempted*
flight and enforced return . a leaden
heaviness had clogged Sibylla's brain
and limbs. Her body was quick to re
cover; her thoughts were for long
drowsy and numb. . She seemed to '
have died to an old life without find*
ing a new one. Blake was to her as
a dead friend; she ;would see and
hear of him no more: she harbored
no idea of meeting him' again. The
bonds between them were finally rent. â 
This attitude toward him saved his
character from criticism and his
weakness from too close an examina
tion, while it left her free to * brood
in the security of despair oh all that
she had thought to find in him and on
the desolation his loss had made. The
instinctive love for her child, which,
had asserted itself while her intellect
was dormant, could , not prevail
against the sullen preoccupation of
reawaklng thoughts, or, if it . could .
penetrate into them, came no more
fresh and pure, but tainted with the
sorrow and the anger., which circled
round that innocent head. She was
tender, but in pity, not in pride; she
loved, but without Joy. The shadows
hung so dark about the qhild's cot.
They still hid from her eyfes the sin
of her own desertion, and hindered
the remorse which might best lead
her back to love unalloyed. Still she
arraigned not herself.- but ,only
Grantley and the inevitable. Grant-,
ley was the inevitable; there stood
jthe truth of it: she bowed her head
to the knowledge, but did not incline
her hdart to the lesson it . .had " to
teach. ' â  , < .
Tet the knowledge counted; she
looked on Grantley with different eyes.
The revelation of himself, wrung from .
him by overwhelming necessity, did
its work. The resolve he had then
announced, presumptuous beyond the â¢
ri^ht of mortal man, less than human
in its cruelty, almost more than hu
man in its audacity of successful re-

lierible.. He could riot .be put on one
side, discarded, j eliminated : from her
life. . He was too biff for that.
Against her will he attracted her at?
tention and constrained her. interest!
The thought of what lay beneath his
suave demeanor sometimes appalled,
sometimes' amused and always fasci
nated her now. She saw that, her old
conception had erred;] it had been
too. negative in character; what ;he
could not do pr be or give;had seemed
the whole of the matter to her. In
the light of the revelation this was
wrong. The positive â a very consid
erable - positive â must be taken into
account. Â«. The pride she had loathed
was. not a barren self-conceit, nor
merely a sterile self-engrossment. It
had issue in an assurance almost su
pernatural and a courage above mor
ality. Sibylla's first relief came in the
reflection that, though she might have
married a: monster, at least she had
not given herself to a stick or a stone;
she was clear as to her â  preferment
when the choice was reduced to that
alternative. â¢ â  , . ,
His behavior appealed to her hu
mor, too â that humor which could not
save, her from running away with
Blake under the spell of her Ideas,
but would certainly have made her
want to run away from him when the
glamour of the ideas had worn off.
The old perfection of manner found
a new ornament in his easy ignoring
of the whole affair. He referred to it
once only, then indirectly and because
he had a reason. He suggested apolo
getically that it would be well for
them to exchange remarks more freely
when the servants were waiting on
them at meals.
"It will prevent comment on recent
events," he added, as though that were
his- only reason. â¢ % .
Sybilla 'â¢' was deceived at first, but
presently detected another and more
Important . motive. The suggestion
marked the beginning of a new cam
paign on which his inexhaustible per
severance engaged. He. understood that
his wife accused him of hot taking her
into his confidence and of not making
her a partner* in. his life. ' He, was no
more minded than before that she
should have even plausible for
complaint. Starting, then, from-gen
eral topics and subjects arising -out of
the Journals of the day, he slid placidly
and dexterously" into frequent discus
sions of his own plans and doings, his
business, his work on the County Coun- '
cil, his Parliamentary ambitions, his
schemes for improving the property at
Milldean. Sibylla acknowledged the
cleverness of v these tactics- with a rue
ful, smile? She' had claimed 46 share'
his life; yet more of thesip topics hap
pened to seem to- hef^rather tedious.
But she was debarred from saying that
to Grantley; his retort' was so obvi
ous. She was often bored,' but she was
amused that boredom 'should be the
first result of the new method.
"I hope all this interests you?"
Grantley- would inquire politely. ,
"Of course, since it concerns you,"
equal politeness .obliged her to replyâ
and not polIteness?only. ?)f . j She had to "be
interested; it had^been her theory, that

ing daily Intercourse went better "than
before Sibylla's flight â went indeed
fairly well, as it can generally be made
to if people, are well, bred and mod
erately humorous.
The great quarrel remained untouch
ed, no span bridged /the great chasm.
Grantley might consent to talk about
his County Council; -that was merely;
a polite Concession, invoiving'no admis
sion of guilt and acknowledging no
cuch wrong to his wife as could for a
moment Justify her action. When it
came to' deeper matters he was afflicted
with a. shame and helplessness which
seemed to paralyze him.. To gloss over
the absence of Jove, or.even of friend
ship, was a task at which he was apt
and tactful; to gain it back was work
of the heartâ and here he -was* as-: yet
at a standstill. His instinct had told
him to work through' the child. But
if he caressed the child in order to con
ciliate Sibylla he: would do "a mean
thing, and yet not succeed in his decep
tion; he would admit a previous fault
and- gain no absolution by a calculated
and interested confession. " He could
not bring* himself to it. His .manner
to the child was as carelessly kind as
ever; and when Sibylla was there the
carelessness was almost more appar
ent than the kindness. Grantley's na
ture, was against him;. to do violence
.to it was a struggle. Ever ready to
be kind . he disliked to show emotion.
He ffilt it was being false to himself,
being a sham and a hypocrite. To be
gushing was abhorrent to him; to pre
tend tot gush surely touched a more
profound depth? His efforts achieved
no success; and he did not let Sibylla
perceive even the. efforts themselves.
For once his will, strong as it was, and
his clear perception were both power
less before his temper and the instincts
of his nature. The result was a dead
lock. Matters could not move.
Such was the Juncture of affairs when
Christine - Fanshaw "came to Milldean.
Perhaps, .only her resolve to escape
from the atmosphere of disgrace at
home could have brought her; for she
came in some trepidation, rather sur
prised that Sibylla had welcomed her,,
wondering whether the welcome was
of Sibylla's own free will. Had not
she betrayed Sibyllla? Was not she
resppnsible for the' frustration of the
great plan?- Yet an acute curiosity
mingled with and almost overpowered
her apprehensions, And she was pre
pared, to defend herself. The rumors
about t Walter Blake would be a
weapon, if she needed oneâa weapon
effective, if cruel. As regards her own
treachery, '' she made haste- to throw
herself on Sibylla's mercy.
"Of cours.e you must have known it
was through me?" she ended.
"Oh, yes, I knew that, of course."
"Here's your letter â the one you
sent me to hand on to Grantley. He
wired me not to send it."
"Oh, I thought he'd read it," said
Sibylla thoughtfully
She took it and put it in her. pocket.
Christine looked at her with a smile.
"And yet you ask me to stay!" she
remarked. . â¢'. 'â .'â â 
Sibylla smiled mockingly.
"Since this household owes all its
happiness to you, it's only, fair that
you should come' and look at it."
"That's" not at all a 'comfortable
thing to say, Sibylla." \ - '
"No, it isn't, and it departs from our
principle, which.ds to, say ; nothing."
"That's, not always very comfortable
cither." ,
Christine was giving a thought to
her own affairs here.
"And we won't say anything more
about.what you did." Sibylla went on.
"We won't discuss whether you were
right, or whether I'm grateful, or any
thing of that sort."
"You ought to be."
"Or even whether I ought to be â
though, of course, you'd want to think
that." . >"v. r , ' '
Christine was -disappointed. In her
heart she had rather hoped to be put
on her defense- just enough to entitle
her to use her weapon and to tell some
of the truth about Watelr Blake.
Sibylla's attitude $ave her no exceuse.
Though she would say nothing
more about what Christine had done,
Sibylla waa easily, persuaded to break
the principle of silence about the main
affair. Christine's curiosity lost the
zest of difficult satisfaction; she had
the whole history for the asking. She
heard it, marveling at the want of re
ticence her friend displayed, seeking
how to reconcile this seeming im
modesty with the rest of her impres
sion of Sibylla. She recollected being
very shy and ashamed (in the midst
of her exultation) when she had let
Harriet Courtland worm out the seoret
of her love for Caylesham. Sibylla
was not ashamed â 6he was candid.
Sometimes she was excited, sometimes
she played the Judge; but she was
never abashed. Christine's wits sought
hard for an explanation of this. Sud
denly It 'came to her as she gazed on
Sibylla's pure face and far-away eyes.'
"My dear, you were , never in love
with him!" she cried.
If she hoped to surprise, or even
to win a compliment on her penetra
tion, she was utterly deceived.
"Oh, no!" said Sibylla. "In the way
you mean I've never been in love with
anybody except Grantley."
"Then why did you? Oh, tell me
about it!" Christine Implored.
"He appealed to my better feelings,"
Sibylla smiled back to her, mocking
again. "l'd give the world that' we
hadn't been stopped! No, I can't say
that, becauseâ â"
"Well?"
"I think Grantley would have done
what he. said."
Christine was the last woman in the
world to. rest ignorant of what Grant
ley had said. Sibylla was again dis
appointingly ready to tell the whole
thing without any pressure worth men
tioning: â  â¢
a "And you really, believe he would
have?" Christine half whispered when
.she had heard the story. -/V. . .
"If, I didn't believe it with my
whole' heart I shouldn't be here. I
should - beâ well, ; somewhereâ with,
Walter Blake."
"Thank God .you are not!" s V :.
"Why do you say that? The pro
prieties, Christine?" â¢ â¢ â 
"Oh, only partly; but don't you
think lightly of., them, all the same!
And the rest of the reasons don't mat
ter." Christine got up and walked
across ; the room and back again be
fore she' came to a stand opposite Si
bylla. "I call that a man worth being
in love with,", she 'said. ' â "â  '. - -i
"Walter?" " .
"Heavens,; no! Grantley Imason.
Oh, I know he's your husband! ..But
stillâ"
Sibylla broke into 1 a gentle laugh.
"It has the attraction of the horri
ble," i Bhfe"admJtted. "He'd- have . done
it, yoii'khpwi" , /â â¢â â ^â¢k\f.%

."You mean, if I don't' let' him man

temptuous. "I don't care about tyr
rany, even - tempered by epigrams,"
she explained.
"Well, not when you only do the
epigrams," smiled Christine.
"That's not true. . I only ask a real
partnership." -
"You must begin by contributing all
you have." *
"I did. But- Grantley â "
, "Paid a composition? Oh yes, my
dear; men do. That's as old as By
ron anyhow." She came suddenly to
Sibylla and kissed her. "And you'd
be adorable, properly deluded."
â¢ "You, shan't put It like that, Chris
tine."
'" "Yes;- 1 .willâ and I r know 'â¢ he-* loves*

had most of it before â without the
name. -But look away. I've no the
ories you knowâ and â well, I was in
love/'v.v; .\* :-".'=' -t.Y'';
She laughed a little, blushing red.
But her composure returned when she
had finished her confession.
"And now what do we think of one
another?" she asked with her usual
satirical little smile. "You don't
know? Oh, yes! You think me
rather wicked and I think you very
silly; that's about what it cornea to."
"I suppose, that is about it." Sibyl
la laughed' reluctantly.
"But I've repented, and you're only
going to repent."
'."Never!"
."Yes, you are! I take no credit for
having done it first. It's much easier
to repent of wickedness than of non
sense. The wickedness is much pleas
anter at the time and so seems much
worse afterward." .
"And you're in love with John?"
"Good heavens, no!" She pulled
herself up. "Well/ I don't know. If
I'm in love now it's not what I used
to mean by it. One gets to use words
so differently as time goes on."
"I, don't think I shall ever learn
that."
Destiny assumed Christina's small,
neat features for a moment in order
to answer sternly:
"But you must!"
It was the worst way of dealing
with Sibylla.
"I' won't!" she! answered in overt
rebellion, her cheek3: flushing, now as
her confession had not availed *to
make it flush. -- .
Christine did not fail to perceive the
comic element in the case â strong
enough, at all events, to serve as a re
lief to conversation, almost piquant
when Grantley conscientiously related
all .manner of uninteresting things in
order that Sibylla might be at liberty
to take an interest in them. But this
aspect , did not carry matters very far
or afford much | real consolation. Sub
stantially no progress was made. The
failure endured and. seemed to Chris
tine as complete as the devastation
wrought, In ,her own life. Nay, here
there was an aggravation. In her home
âshe almost;. smiled to use the word
nowâ there was no child.' Here there
was' the boy. Her mind flew forward
to the time when he would wonderirigly
surmise, painfully guess, at last grow
Into knowledge.
And already the mind stirred in little
Frank. His intelligence grew, his af
fection blossomed as the first buds of a
flower. "He was no more merely a pas
sive object of love and care. He began
to know more than that he was nursed
and fed, more than th,at his right was
to 'these ministrations. The idea of the
reason dawned in him. He stretched
forth his hand no longer for bounty
only, but for the lnspirer of bountyâ
for love. Strung to abnormal sensi
tiveness, Christine deluded herself with
the fancy that already he felt the
shadow over the house, that his young
soul was already chilled by the clouds
of anger and vainly cried for the sun
shine of sympathy. If she did not truly
see, yet she forsaw truly. Seeing and
foreseeing thus, she asked where was
the hope. And on this, with a bound,
her thoughts went back to her own
sorrow and back to poor lonely old
John' in London, all. by himself, with
nobody to talk to, nobody to congratu
late him on the success of his business,
nobody to open his heart to, alone -with
his grievance against her, alone with
the thought , that, notwithstanding his
grievance, he had taken Prank Cayle
sharn's money and grew prosperous
again;by the aid of it. 'â â¢>â 
When Christine had been at Milldean
a fortnight or so, business carried
Grantley to town. The change his de
parture made' was instantaneous and
striking. A weight was off the house,
the clouds dispersed. Sibylla was full
of gayety, and in that mood she could
make all about her share her mirth.
Above all, her devotion to Frank was
given full peln. The child was always
with her and she knew no happiness
save in evoking and responding to his
love. She was now open and ostenta
tious about it, fearing no frigid glances
and no ltiplied criticism of her fond
folly. Christine might well have found
new ground for despair, so plainly did
Sibylla display to her the blighting In
fluence of Grantley's presence. He it
was who froze up love â bo Sibylla de
clared with an impetuous, aggressive
openness. But Christine would not de
spair. A wholesome anger rose in her
heart and forbade despair. Her man
ner took on a coldness exceeding'Grant
ley's indifference. She would not be a
sharer in the -games, a partner In the
merriment, a sympathizer in the love.
Sibylla was hot slow to see how she
stood off and drew herself away. Quick
ly she sought for reasons. Was it that
Christine would not Join In what seem
ed .to be a league against Grantley? Or
â was there another reason? She had
told Christine how it-was through Wal
ter Blake's horror and not through her
scruples that little Frank had not been
left to : his fate. Did her love then
seem hypocrisy? That was not true-r
though it might be true that remorse
now had a share in it. The more the
child grew to life, the more horrible, be
came the thought that he might have
died. After a day or two of smolder
ing protest, she broke out on Chris
tine.
"You think I've no right to love him,"
she asked, "after what I was ready to
do? Is that what you think? Oh, speak
out plainly! -I see you've got something:
against me."
Christine was cold and composed.
Never had her delicately critical man
ner been more pronounced.
'/I'm sure I hope you repent," she
observed meditatively; "and I hope you
thank heaven' that man was what he
turned put to be." â¢ ' â¢
"Well, call it repentance then. I sup
pose rl've a right to repent? You can't
understand hew I. really feel. But if it
is repentance .why need you discourage
it?",,

Her smile was rather disdainful.

important to you doesn't seem to be

"What do you mean by that?" ' she
asked in low, quick tones.* The charge
.was so strangely- like that which she
was forever formulating against
Grantley. Now Christine leveled it at
her. â  , â "â .-.'â¢â¢ -'.-:â :
"You call Grantley selfish." Christine
went on. "You're just as bad yourself.â
yes, worse. He is trying to be different,
I believe. Oh, I admit the poor man
doesn't do it very wellâ he gets very
little encouragement. But are you try
ing? No! You're quite content with
yourself. You've done no wrong. Well,
perhaps it was a little questionable to
be ready to leave Frank to die! But
even that would be all right if only I
could understand it!"
"You'd better go on now,"- said Sibyl
la quietly.
â¢'Yes, I will go on; I am gping on.
You were ready to leave the child. to
die sooner than go on living as you'd
been living? Isn't that how you put it?
You were willing to give his life to pre
vent that? Well, are you willing to give
any of your own life, any of your way
of thinking, any of what you call your
nature, or your temperament, or what
not?. Not, a bit of it! You can love
Frank when there's no danger of
Grantley's thinking it may mean that
you "could" forgive him! As soon as
there's any danger of that, you draw
back. You use the unhappy child as a
shield between Grantley and yourself,
as a weapon against Grantley. Yes,
you do, Sibylla. Whenever you're in
clined to relent toward Grantley, you
go, and sit by that child'e cot and use
your love for him to fan your hatred
against Grantley. Isn't that true?"
Sibylla sat silent, with attentive
frightened eyes. This was a new pic
tureâwaa It a true one? Ona feature of
it at least struck home with a terribly
true : seemlng, likeness of her own mind.
She used her love for her child to fan
her hatred against Grantley!
"You complain," Christine went on in
calm relentlessness. "of what Grantley
is to the child. That's a sham most of
the time. You're, thinking of what he
is to you. And even where it's true,
don't you do all you can to make him
feel as he does? Hevy is he to love what
you make the stalking-horse of 'your
grievances?" She turned on Sibylla
scornfully, almost fiercely now. "Your
husband; your son! the whole world,
aren't made for your emotions to go
sprawling over, Sibylla! You muat have
caught that idea from young Blake, I
think."
She walked/ off. to the window and
stood there, looking out. No "sound
camefrom Sibylla. Presently Christine
looked round rather nervously. She
had gone a little too " far, perhaps!
That phrase aboiit emotions "sprawl
ing" wasâ well, decidedly uncompro
mising. -She met Sibylla's eyes. They
wore a haunted look â as though some
peril walled her in and she found no
way to escape. Her voice trembled
as she faltered:
"Is" that what you really think of
me. Christine?"
"A bruised, reed thou shalt not
break." Christine had the wisdom to
remember that. Remorse must fall
short of despair, self-knowledge of
self-hatred, or there remains no pos
sibility of a rebound to hope and ef
fort. Christine came across to her
friend with hands outstretched.
"No, no. dear," she said, "not you
â not yourself! But the mood of
yours, the way you're going on. And,
true or false, isn't it what you. must
make Grantley think?"
Sibylla moved her hands in a rest
leas gesture, protesting against the
picture of herself â even thus soft
ened â denying its truth, fascinated by
it. . â  â¢; y
"I don't know,", she murmured, "t

CHAPTER XXII.
Aspiration and Common Sense.
Rumor spoke truly. Youngr Walter
Blake was back In town with an en
tirely new crop of aspirations matur
ing in the ready soil of his mind.
The flrit crop had not proved fortu
nate. It had brought him into a po
sition most disagreeable and humiliat
ing to reflect upon, and Into struggles
for which he felt himself little â¢ fit. He
had been given time to meditate and
to cool â to cool even to shuddering
when he recalled that night in the
Sailors' Rest and pictured the tragedy
for which he had so nearly become re
sponsible. His old desires waning, his
aspirations were" transfigured at the
suggestion of a new attraction. He
had been on the wrong tackâ that was
certain. Again virtue seemed to tri
umph in this admission. He no longer
desired to be made goodâ It was (as he
had conceived and attempted it) such a
stormy and soul-shaking process. Now
he desired to be kept good. He did not
now want a guiding star which ho was
to follow through every peril, over
threatening waves and through the
trough of an angry sea. The night at
the Sailors' Rest disposed of that meta
phor and that ideal. Now he wanted
an anchor by whose help ha might ride
out the storm, or a harbor whose placid
bosom should support his gently sway
ing bark. Strength, constancy and
common sense supplanted Imagination,
ardor and self-devotion as the requi
sites his life demanded. '.
Again Caylesham showed tact. He
would not' ask the lady's name. But
when Blake next dined with him, he en-
Joyed the metamorphosis, and silently
congratulated ; Grantley . Imason. ! i
"So it's St. George, Hanover Square,
and everything quite regular this time,
is It?" he asked with an Indulgent hu
mor. "Well, I fancy you're best suited
to that, Only take care!"
"You may be sure that the woman I
marry will be â ~" Blake began.
"Perfection? Oh, of course! That's
universal. But It's not enough." He
lay back comfortably' in his armchair,
enjoying h(s cigar: ''Not enough, my
boy! I may have two horses, and you
may have two horses, and each of my
horses may. be better than either of
your horses, but when we come to drlv-.

"That's Just. what I've been think

"Iâ I miscalculated. Well, we must
all learn by experience."
"Deuced lucky if we can!"
"There's no other way," Blake in
sisted. . V. -â¢ . ..â 
"Have I said there is?" He looked at
Blake in an amused knowledge. "Gol&s
In for the straight thing this time?"
Half in pride, half in shame, Blake
answered:
"Yes."
"Quite right too!" Caylesham was
very approving. m*ty
"Well, if, you say soâ" began Blake,
laughing.
VQuite right for you, I mean." There
was a. touch of contempt somewhere in
his tone. "But don't, forget what I've
been saying. It's double harness, my
boy! Pace, my boy, and temper, and
the feelâ the feel! All the things a fel
low never thinks about!"
"Well, you're a pretty preacher on
this subject!"
"I've heard a lot of things you never
have. Oh. well, you may havÂ« once,
perhaps." His glance was very acute,
and Blake flushed under it. "You're
well out of ttfat affair," Cayleaham
went on, dropping his mask of ignor
ance. "Oh. I don't want to know how
it happened. I expect I can guess." -
"What do you mean?" Blake's voice
sounded angry.
"You flunked itâ eh?"
. It was a strong thing to say to a man
in your own house. But a sudden gust
of impatience had swept Caylesham
away. The young man was In the end
so . contemptible, so incapable of
strength, such a blarney over his weak
ness.
"Now don't glare at me; I'm not
afraid. You tackled* too big a Job, I
fancy. -Oh. I'm not asking questions,
you know." He got up and patted
Blake's shoulder. "Don't mind me.
You're doing quite right. Hope you
won't find it impossibly dull!"
Blake's bad temper vanished. He be
gan to laugh.
"That's right," said Caylesham. "I'm
too old to convert, and nearly too old
to fight; but \'U be your best man,
Walter."
"It'll keep me straight. Caylesham."
"Lord- bless you, so- it will:"
He chuckled in irrepressible amuse
ment. â¢-â¢'â¢-- â¢ "j - - V -*â!â ;*>
"The other thing's no go!" v
"No more it Is. " It needs No, I'm
not going to be immoral any more. 'Go
ahead! You're made for double harness,
Walter. Choose her 4 well; you'll have
to learn her paces, you know."
''Or she mine?"
Blake was a little on his dignity
again. . -' .
"Have another whisky and soda "
said Caylesham, with admirable tact
His advice, meant as precautionary
proved provocative. Memory worked
with itâ the carklng memory of a fall-ore of courage. Blake might blarney
as he would about awakened conscience,
but Caylesham. had put his finger on
the sore spot. Pleasure's potentiality
of tragedy had asserted itself. It had
bter-. supremely disconcerting to dis
cover and recognize its existence.-
Yctngf Blake was for morality now â
not so much because its eyes were
turned upward as for the blameless
security of Its embrace. He had-suf
fered such a scare. He really wondered
how Caylesham had managed to stand
the strain of pleasing himself â with
the sudden tragic potentialities of it.
He paid unwilling homage to the qual
ities necessary for viceâ for candid un
masquerading vice; he knew all about"
the other species.
Yet he was not hard on Sibylla. He
recognized her temperament, her un
hap- - circumstances, and his own per
sonal attractions. What he did not
recognize was the impression of him
self which that night in the Sailors'
Rest might leave on her. He conceived
an idea of his own magnanimity rest
ing In her mindâ yes. though such a
notion could gain no comfortable foot
ing in his.
Caylesham let him go without more
advice â though he had half a mind to
tell him not to marry a pretty woman.
'"Oh. well, in his present mood he
won't; and It would do him lots of
good if he did." the impenitent, clear
sighted, good-humored sinner reflected,
with all the meaning which his experi
ence could put into the words. He was
of opinion that for certain people the
only chance of salvation lay in suffer
ing gross injustice. "If what a fellow
brings on himself is justice," he used to
say. He always maintained that fel
lows brought it on themselves â an ex
piring gasp of conscience, perhaps.
Gossip and conjecture had played so
much with Walter Blake's name that
Mrg. Selford had at first been shy of
his approaches and chary of her wel
come. "We muet think of Anna," she
had said to her husband. But think
ing of or for Anna was rapidly becom
ing superfluous. The young woman
took that department to herself. Her
Stylishness grew marvelou/ly. and im
posed a yoke of admiring submission.
It was an extraordinary change from
the awkward, dowdy, suppressed girl to
this excellently appointed product. The
liberty so tardily conceded was making
up for lost time, and bade fair to trans
form itself into a tyranny. JThe parents
â were ready subjects, and cast back
from the theories of to-day a delusive
light on the practices of the past. They
concluded that they had always in
dulged Anna, and that the result was
most satisfactory. Then they must in
dulge her still. So Blake's visits went
on, and the welcome became cordial.
For Anna was quite clear that she at
least had nothing against Blake. His
attraction for her was not * what had

impulse w not to reform;, it was to
conquer. But gossip and conjecture as
to his past life were as good incentives
to the one task as to the other. His
good looks, his air of fashion, his
comfortable means, helped the work.
He widened the horizon of men
for her, and made her out of
conceit with her first achievements.
She was content that Jeremy should
disappear from her court; she became
contemptuously impatient .. of Alec
Turner's suit. She was fastidious and
worldly 'wise.
Again Mrs. Selford rejoiced. She
had been in some consternation over
Alec Turner's now dbvious attachment,
coming Just at the time, when. Anna
had established the right'' to, please
herself. Suppose her nrst:,iise of lib
erty had been to throw hefself.away?

Anna was quite safe-^strangely safe,

most unkindly safe, she thought some
times, as she strove to soften the blows
â which fell on poor Alec â since, so soon
a* he ceased to be dangerous, he be
came an object of compassion.' 1
"Anna is so sensible," she said to
Selford. "She's quite free from the
fcilliness that girls so often show," but
she sighed Just a little as she spoke.
"She'd make a good wife for any
mart," declared Selford proudly â 3.
general declaration in flat contradic
tion to Caylesham's theories about
double harness. - '
Anna paid Â»no heed to opinions or
comments. She went about her busi
ness and managed it with Instinctive
skill. It sometimes puzzled poor Alec-
Turner to think why his presence was
EC often requested, when his arrival
evoked so little enthusiasm. He did
not realize the part he played in Anna's
scheme, nor how his visits were to ap
pear to Walter Blake. Anna's general
ship had thought all th^s out. The ex
hibition of Alec was a subsidiary move
in the great strategic conception of
rapturing Walter Blake on the re
bound from Sibylla. _., '..-
But the pawn was not docile, and
obje ted violently so soon as its func
tion began to be apparent. Anna pre
cipitated what she did not desireâ a
passionate avowal in which the" theme
of her own gifts and fascination was
intermingled with the ideal of influenc
ing *".e trend of public opinion from a
modest home and on a modest. Income.
She was told that she could be removed
from the vanities of life and. be her
true, her highest â¢ self. When -, she
showed no inclination to accept the op
portunity thus indicated, Alec passed
through incredulity tÂ« anger. Had he
cast his pearls before â well, at lnappre
ciatlve feet? At this tone Anna became
excusably huffy; to â  refuse a young
man is not to deny all the higher moral
obligations. Besides Alec annoyed her
very much by assuming persistently
that the dictates of her heart called her
toward him, and that worldly consider
ations alone inspired her refusal.
"Oh, you're silly!" sh.e cried. "I tell
you it's nothing of the sort.".
The dusk of the afternoon softened
her 'eatures; the light of the fire threw
up in clear outline the stylish well
gowned figure. Poor Alec, in his shab
by mustard suit, stood opposite her,
his hands in his pockets, in dogged
misery and resentment, with all the
helpless angry surprise of a first ex
perience of this kind, fairly unable to
understand how it was that love did
not call forth love, obstinate in cling
ing to the theory > f another reason as
the sole explanation. Things did not
exist in vain. For what was his love?"
"Butâ but what am I to do?" he
stammeredf
Rather puzzledâ after all, rather flat
teredâAnna prayed him to be sensible
and friendly. He consented to hope for
her happiness, though he was obvious
ly not sanguine about it. For himself
all was over! So he said as he flung out
of the room, knowing nothing of what
lay before him on the path of life; dis
cerning nothing of a certain daughter
of a poor old political writerâ a little
round \vom-.n who made her own
gowns, was at once very thrifty
and very untidy, was inclined to think
that the rulers of the earth should be
forcibly exterminated, and lavished an
unstinted affection on every being, hu
man or brute, with which she was
ever brought into contact. And if she
did not greatly influence the trend of
public opinionâ well, anyhow she tried
to. Just now, however. Alec knew
nothing about her; he was left to
think hopelessly of the trim figure and
.the lost Jdealsâ the two things would
mix themselves up in his mind.
To his pathetic stormy presence there
succeeded Walter Bluke, with all his
accomplishment in the art of smooth
love making, with his aspirations
again nicely adjusted to the object of
his desires (he was so much cleverer
than poor Alec over that!), with his
power to flatter not only by love but
still more by relative weakness. He,
of course, did not run at the thing
as Alec had done. That would be
neither careful of the chances nor eco
nomical of the pleasure. Many a talk
was needed before his purpose became
certain or Anna could show any sign
of understanding it.
He dealt warily with her; he was
trying, unconsciously, perhaps, to per
form the task Caylesham had indi
cated to himâ the task of learning her
paces and adapting his thereto. It was
part of his theory about her that she
must be approached with great cau
tion; and of course he knew that there
was one very delicate bit of ground.
How much had she heard about him
self and Sibylla? It Was long before
he mentioned Sibylla's name. At last
he ventured on throwing out a feeler.
Anna's- unruffled composure persuaded
him that slie knew nothing of the facts,
but her shrewd analysis of Sibylla
shewed. In his judgment, that she quite
understood the woman. It was the
dusk of the afternoon again (Anna
rather affected that time of day), and
Blake, with a sigh which might be
contidered as in the nature of a con
fession, ventured to say:
"I wish I could read peorle as you
can. 1 should have avoided a lot of
trouble."
I "You can read yourself, anyhow,
can't you?" asked Anna.
/'By Jove, that's goodâ that's very
'good! No, I don't know that I can.
But I expect you can read me. Miss
Selford. I shall have to come to you
for lessons, shan't I?"
"I'll tell you all the hard bits," she
laughed,
"You'll have to see a lot of me to
do that!"'
Anna was not quite so sure of the
need, but she did not propose lo stop
the game. * '.4
â¢' "Do I seem so very reluctant. to see
a lot of you?" she inquired.
Blake's eyes caught hers through, the
semi-dcrkness. She was aware of the
emotion with which he regarded her.
It f.und an answer in her, an answer
which for the moment upset both^Jier
coolness and her sense of mastery. She
had a , revelation, that her dominion,
not ' seriously threatened, would be
pleasantly ! checkered . by intervals of
an instinctive submission. This feel
ing almost smothered the element of
contempt which had hitherto mingled
in her liking for him and impaired 1 the
-pride of her. conquesL : ", '
"I was judging you by myself. Com
pared with me, you seem reluctant,'.'
he said in a low voice, coming a little
nearer to her. "But then it does me
a lot of â  good to come and see you.
It's not only the pleasure I come for,
though that's very great. You keep
up my Ideals."
. "I'm so glad. The other day I was
told I'd ruined all somebody's | ideals.
Well, I oughtn't to have told you that,
I suppose; but it slipped out."
Things will slip out, if one takes care
to le%ve the door open.
She, was standing by the-table and
Blake was now close by her.
"Since I've known youâ','
"Why, you've known me 'for years,
Mr. Blake!"
"No. I only knew a little girl tillâ till
I came back, to town this time." He
referred to that yachting cruise on
which he had ultimately started alone.
"But since then I've been aâdifferent
sort of fellow. I want .to go on being
different, and you can help me." His
voice trembled; he was wrapped up in
his emotion and â  abundantly sure, of
its sincerity.
Anna moved away a little, now
rather nervous, since no instinct, how-

ever acute, can give quite the assur
ance that practice brings. But she was
very . triumphant, too, <i:;d moreover a
good deal touched. That break in
young Blake'fe voice had done him good
service before; it never became arti
ficial or overdone, thamts to his facul
ty of coming quite fresh to every new
emotional crisis; it was always most
happily natural.
"Anna!" he said^ holding out his
hands, with those skillfully appealing
eyes of his just penetrating to hers.
With a long drawn breath she gave
him her hand. He pressed it and be
gan to draw her cently toward him.
She yielded- to him slowly, thinking at
the last moment of what she had de
cided she would never think about an&
would show no wisdom in recalling.
The vision of another woman had shot
into her mind and for. a few seconds
gave her pause. Her hesitation was
short and left her self-confidence un
broken. What she had won she would
keep. The dead should bury its dead
â a thing it had declined- to do for
Chrixtine Fanshaw. "V* -
"Anna!" he said again. "Do you
want me to say. more? Isn't that say
ing it all? I can't Â«ay all of it, you
know."
She let him draw her slowly to him;
but she had spoken no word and was
not yet in his arms when the door
opened and she became aware of a
man standing on the threshold. Young
Blake, all engrossed, had noticed noth
ing, but he had perceived her yielding.
"Ah", my Anna" he whispered rap
turously.
"Hush" she hissed, drawing her hand
sharply away. "Is that you, Rieh-
Kichards was the Selfords' man scr
'a The man laughed.
"If you'd turn the light on, you could
not mistake me for auyoody so rcspec
ta.ble as Richards," he said. "I've been
with your father 1 in the study and he
told me I would find your mother here."
Anna recognized the voice.
"Mr. Imason, I didn't know you were
in London. ii -- v
"Just up for the day and I wanted
to see your father."
Anna moved to the switch and turned
on the light. She glanced hastily -at
young Blake. He had not moved; his
face was rather i - ed and he looked un
happy. Anna's feeling was one of pro
nounced anger against Grantley Ima
son. His appearance had ail the effect
of purposed malice; it made her feel
at once jealous and absurd. But it was
on her own behalf that she resented
it. She was not free from a willingness
that Blake should be made uneomfort-
able; so much discipline would be quite
wholesome for him. For her own part,
though, she wanted to get out of the
room. .
"May I ring for the real Richards
and â Oh, I bag your pardon, Blake,
how are you? May I ring fc-r the real
Richards and send word / to . your
mother, Anna?"
Grantley was, as usual, urbane and
unperturbed.
"I'll go and find her for you. I think
she's lying down."
'"Oh, .well, thenâ â "
"No. I know she'll want to see you,"
and Anna ran lightly out of the room.
Graiitley strolled to an armchair and
sank into it. He did not look at Blake,
nor, his formal ! greeting given, â¢ appear
to be conscious of his presence.
Young Blake was. in a turmoil; He
hated to see Grantley; all the odious
thought of his failure and defeat was
brought back. He hated that Grant
ley should- have seen him making J.ove
to Anna Selford. for. in. his heart he
was conscious that he could not cheat
an outside vision as he could manage
to cheat himself. But both these feel
ings, if not swallowed up ln:fear, were
at least outdone by it. His Â£reat de
sire had been to settle . this" matter
finally and irrevocably before, a hint
of it came to the ears. either 5 of Grant
ley; or Sibylla. What would Grantley
do now?
"You saw us?" he asked in a sullen
anxious voice.
"I couldn't help it. I'm sorry," said
Grantley in colorless politeness. .
"Wen?" v>; â â  . ;â ;.
"I really don't understand your ques
tion, Blake. At least you seem to mean
it for a auestion," . .
"You do know what I mean. I'm not
going; to ask any favors of you. I only
want to know what you intend to do?"
"About what?" :, ~t;0 I
"About what you sawâ and heard,
too, I suppose?"
Grantley rose' from his chair in a
leisurely fashion and stood with his
back to the fire. He was looking at
young Blake with a slight smile; Blake
grew redder under it. .
"Oh, I 'can't beat about the bush,"
Blake went on impatiently. ."You
might, if you chose, tell Miss Selford
what you know."
"Well?" said Grantley in his turn.
"And â and oh, you see what might
happen as well as I do. Iâ I meant to
âto explain at my own time;. but â '-"
"I shouldn't let \ the time come In a
hurry, Blake. It'll be a very awkward
quarter of an hour for both of you, and
quite unnecessary.'.*
"Unnecessary?" ;
There was a ring of hope in Blake's
voice; he liked to be told that any such
confession was unnecessary, and would
have welcomed such an assurance even
from. Grantley's hostile lips.
"Certainly; and equally unnecessary
that I should tell Anna anything." He
paused' a moment and then went on.
"In a different case I might think I had
a different dutyâ though, being what
you. might call an interested party, I
should consider carefully before I al
lowed myself to act on that view. But
as matters stand you -yourself hare
made any action on my part superflu
ous.". -Jy ..',â¢;
"I have?" " . .t:/"^'.--; :
"Oh, yes! You so far injured the
fame of the woman for whom you had
not afterward the pluck to fight â¢ that
It's not necessary for me to .tell Sel
ford lhat you were in love with her
a few months before you made love
to his daughter, nor that you tried to
run away with her, but that in the end
you ftinked the job. I needn't tell him,
because he know?â and his wife- knows.
You took care of. that." . "
Young Blake said nothing, though he
opened his lips as if to speak;
"And I needn't tell Anna, either.
That's unnece?sary for the same rea
son. She knows just as well as her
father and mother know."
"She knows nothing, -I tell you. She
hasn't an idea " .. - -
"Did you see her face when she saw
thru 1â wasn't Richards?"
."I tell you â . She was embarrassed,
at courseâBut "
"She 'khc-svs Â«.uite wpII, 'Blake. .Oh,
r.ot the . details, but the main thing.
She knows that quite well. And she
will have made, her decision. There's
no duty incumbent on me."
"You'll say .nothing then?"
"I shall. say nothing at all." â 
' Grantley it-lapsed into Â«i>ence â a most
easy pelf-possessed silence. . His eyes
were on -young Blak? no. mere, but rest-'
ed placidly on one of Selforcl's best pic
tures on the opposite 'wall. Wake clear
ed his throat and shifted uneasily from
one fotrt to the ether. 4 .
"Why do you stay?" asked Grantley
mildly. "Wouldn't it be better to con
tinue your interview with- Anna elre
ivhere? Mrs. Selford's coming in here,
you see."
Biake broke out: ,. .": i~
"God knows, Imason. It's difficult. 'for
v me to say a word to you, butâ : â ','
Grantley raised his hand a little.
"It's Impossible." ho said. J "There
can be no words between you and ms
about that. And what doe? it matter
to you what- 1 think? I shall hold my
tongue. And you'll feei sure I've no
real cause of complaint â quite sure if
only I hold my tongue. And I think
Anna will hold her tongue." Then you'll
forget she knows and go, on .posturing
before her with entire satisfaction to
yourself." He turned his eye? on him
and laughed a little. "As long as you
can humbug yourself or. anybody ejse.
or even' get other people^ to let you
think you're humbugging them you're
quite happy, you know."
Blake looked at him once . or twice,
but his tongue found no words. He
turned and walked toward the, door.
"Wait in the dining-room," said
Grantley. .^;. V . â : J :.^'.^;\;yi
Blake went out without turning or
seeming to hear. After a: moment or
two Anna's step came down the stairs.
"Mamma'll be down directly, Mr. Im
ason," she /called as' she. reached â  the
door. Then her eyes tc-ok in the room.
"Mr.â Mr. Blake?" she asked, .with a
sudden quick rush, of color to her
cheeks. ....
"I think you will find him in the din
,Ing-room," said Grantley, gravely.
â  She understoodâ and she did not lack
courage.' She had enough for twoâ for
herself and for Blake, rthe met Grant
ley's look fair and square, drawing up
her trim stylish figure to a. stiff rigid
ity, and setting her lips In a resolute
line. Grantley admired her attitude and
her open defiance' of him. He. smiled
at her in a confidential. mockery.
"Thanks, Mr. Imason, I'll took for
him. You'll be all right' till mamma
comes?" : ',
"Oh, yes, I shall '. e all right, thanks,
Anna." v <
He sn.iled still. Anna gave ' him an
other look of defiance.- â¢â¢â¢-"" â¢'â -â¢
"I Intend to go my own way; I know
what I'm about. I don't care a pin
what you think." \ The- glance seemed
to Grantley as eloquent as Lord Burgh
ley's nod. And no more than Lord
Burghley did she spoil its effect by
words. She cave it to Grantley full
and square, then 'turned on her heel
and swung jauntily out of -the room.
Grantley's . smile vanished. He
screwed up his lips as4f he had tasted
something rather sour. ? '.
CHAPTER XXIII.
A Thing of Fear. . :
Grantley Imason had Intended .to go
down to Milldean that same evening,
but a summons from Tom Courtland
reached him, couched in such terms
that he could not hesitate to obey it.
He sought Tom at his club,the moment
he received the message.- Tom had
been sent for to his own- house in the
morning, and had heard what - had
happened there. â  He had :â  seen 'the
wounded child and the other two ter
rified little, creatures.- Suezctte Bligh
Gave him her account. The doctor
told him that. Sophy was no longer in
danger, but that the matter was a
grave one â a very serious shock and
severe local injury; the child -would
recover with-care and with quiet, but
would always bear a mark " of the
wound, an ineffaceable scar. That was
the- conclusion, half good half bad,
reached after a. night of doubt whether
Sophy would not die . from the vio
lence and the shock.
"Did you see. your wife?" Grantley
asked. - ;<Vv y -â¢ '-â -/-â¢'â 
"See her? I should kill her if I saw
her," groaned Tom.
"Butâ but what's being done?"
, "She's In her room â she's been there
ever since it happened. Suzette's seen
herâ nobody else. Nobody else will go
near her. Of course while. there -was-* a
doubt aboilt I Sophyâ well, the doctor
made it a condition that she should
confine herself to her room, till the
thing took a definite turn. I hope
she's frightened at last. I don't know
what to do. The woman ought to be
hanged, Grantley." --â¢ t ' -'â 
But wrath and horror ; at his wife
were not the only -feelings in Tom's
mind; the way the thing had hap
pened raised other thoughts. He was
prostrate under the sense that the
fury which had smitten poor little
Sophy had been aimed at him; his
acts had inspired and directed it. He
had made his children's love for him
a -crime in their mother's eyes. All his
excuses.'-both false and real, failed him
now. His own, share in the tragedy of
his home was heavy and heinous in hi
eyes. â  â¢ l*."-':
"I ought to have remembered the
children," he kept repeating desperate
ly. He. ought to have stayed and
fought the' battle for and with them,
however hard the battle was. But he
had run awayâ to Mrs. Boltonâ and
left them alone to endure tfie increased
fury of Harriot's rape. "I've been a
damned coward over it," he said, "and
this is what comes of it, Grantley!"
It was all true. Tom had not thought
of the children. Even though he loved
th?m, he had deserted them treacher-
ous.':-. because he had considered only
his own wrongs, and had been wrapped
up in his own personal quarrel with his
wife. What he had found unendurable
himself he had left those helpless lit
tle creatures to endure. All the argu
ments which, had seemed so strong to
justify or to palliate his resort to the
<Bolton refuge sounded weak and mean
to him newâ and to Grantley too, who
had been used to rely, on them, lightly
accepting them with a man of the
world's easy philosophy. His friends
had almost encouraged Tom in his
treacherous desertion of his children;
they too had looked a.t nothing but the
merits of his quarrel with Harriet,
putting that by Itself in a false isola
tion from the total life of the family,
of. which it was in truth an integral
indivisible part. So Grantley meditated
as he listened to Tom's laments; and
the meditation was not without mean
ing and life for him also.
' Tom had a request to make of him â
that he would go round" to the house
and spend the evening there.
,"[ daren't trust myself near Harriet,"
he said, 'â¢yul I'm uneasy with only
th<- servants there. They're all afraid
N of her. She was cowed, Suzette says,
while there was danger; but she may
break out againâ anything might start
her again. If you could stay till she's
safely in bed "
"I'll stay all night, if necessary, old
fellow," said Grantley promptly.
"â¢It'll take a weight off my mind â
and I've got about enough to bear. I'm
going: to stay here, of course; so you'll
know where to find me if I'm wanted,
though I don't see what can happen
now."
.Terror brooded over the Courtlands'
house. , Grantley rejoiced to see how
his coihlng did something to lift the
cloud. The two children left Suzette's
side, (they loved her, but she seemed
to them a defense all too frail), and
came to him, standing on either side
of his knee and putting their hands in
his. The listening: strained look passed
out of their eyes as he talked to them.
Presently little Vera climbed up and
nestled en his knee, while Lucy leant
against his shoulder, and he got them
to prattle about happy things, old holi
days and bygone treats to which Tom
had taken them. At last Lucy laughed
merrily at some childish memory. The
sound â¢ Vt'tnt - straight to Grantley's
heart: a great tenderness came upon
him. As he kissed them, his thoughts
flew to his own little son â the child who
had now begun to know love, to gTeet
It and to ask for it. How these poor
children prized even a decent kindness!
Grantley . seemed to himself .to have
done a fine day's workâ as fine a day's
work as he had ever done in his life â
when ho sent them off to bed with
smiling lips and eyes relieved of dread.
"You s won't go away to-night, will
you?." Lucy, whispered as she kissed
him good night:
"Of course he's not going!" cried lit
tle Vera, bravely confident in the
strength of her helplessness.'
"No," I'll stay all night â all the whole
night," Grantley promised..
He made his camp in the library on
the ground floor, and there presently.
Suzette Bttgh came to see him. She
gave a good account of the wounded
child. Sophy slept; the capable cheery
woman who had come as nurse gave
her courage to sleep.
"We must get her away to the seaside
as soon as possible, and she'll get all
right, I think; though there must be a
mark always. And of course the per-
â *vTV
mancnt question remains. Isn't It all
hopeless, Mr. Imason?"*
"It's a terrible business for you to
be involved in."
"Oh, I can only thank heaven I was
here! But for me I believe she'd have
killed the child."
"What state is she in now?"
"I really den't know. She won't
speak to me. She sits quite still, just
staring at me. I jry to stay with her,
but. It's too dreadful. I can't help hat
ing her â and I think she knows it."
Grantley had some experience of com
ing: to know what people feel about
him.
"I expect she does," he nodded.
"What, will happen. Mr. Imason?"
"J don't know â except that the chil
dren mustn't stay with her. Is she
afraid of being prosecuted, do you
think?"
"She hasn't said anything about it.
No, she doesn't seem afraid;" I don't
think that's her feeling. Butâ but hep
eyes look awful. When I had to tell her
that the doctor had â¢ forbidden her to
come near the children, and said
he would send the police into the house
if she tried to go to them â well. I've
never seen such an expression on any
human face before. She looked like â
like somebody in hell, Mr. Imason."
"Ah!" groaned Grantley with a jerk
of his head, as though he turned from
a fearful spectacle.
"I've just been with her. I persuaded
her to go to bed â she's not slept since
it happened, I know â and got her to le.Â£
mo heli> her to undress. Her maid
won't go to her, she's too frightened. I
hope she'll go to sleep, or really I think
she'll lose her senses." She paused and
then asked: 'â¢Will this make any differ
ence in â in the proceedings?"
"Well, It gives Tom something to bar
gain with, doesn't It? But you can't
tell with her. The ordinary motives
may not appeal to her, any more than
the natural feelings. I hope it may be
possible to frighten her."
"Anyhow, the children won't have to
stay? You're sure of that?" .
"We must try hard for that," said
Grantley.
But Tom had Tnade even that more
difficult, because he had considered only
his own quarrel, and not thinking of
the children had run away to refuge
with Mrs. Bolton, saving his own skin
by treacherous flight.
Suzette bade Grantley good-night.
She, too, must sleep or her strength
would fail.
"You'll keep the door open?" she
asked. "And her room Is just over this.
You'll hear if she moves, though I don't
think she will. It is good of you, Mr.
Imason. We shall all sleep quietly to
night/ Oh, but how tired you'll be!"
"Not I." he smiled. "I've often sat up
till daylight on less worthy occasions.
You're the hero! You've come through
this finely."
Suzette's cheeks flushed at this praise.
"I do love the poor children," "she
said, as Grantley pressed her hand.
He sat down to his vigil. 0

PARADISE FLAT was excited;
likewise disgusted. For the
third time within a year the
Marysvllle stage had been dis
seized of its valuable contents by a
gentleman who had employed on each
occasion the assistance of a stentorian
voice and a large, fat shotgun. The
persuasive eloquence of the voice and
the respect inspiring appearance of the
gun had always* produced their effect
fit the same spot, some ten miles below
the Flat, and invariably on a trip
when the stage was carrying a heavy
consignment of dun to Marysville. On
these bits of evidence, as well as the
further indubitable fact that "No two
fellers on this yerth could holler like
that ," Driver Hank
Dillard had based his conclusion that
"the same identical galoot done all
the Jobs."
Inasmuch as Wells.Fargo & Co. had
concluded after the successful termina
tion of the previous affairs that they
could no longer afford to conduct an
eleemosynary institution for the benefit
of peripatetic arsenals, they had dis
continued their service on Hank's line
and the third loss had fallen directly
upon the contributors of dust from the
Flat. This fact, coupled with. the In
formation that a traveler on the late
stage had so far upset the traditions
of modern Dick Turpinism as to have
taken a parting long-distance shot at
the highwayman, with the result that
he believed he had "winged him," did
not tend to allay popular excitement
in camp.
As soon as it was light on the fol
lowing morning the vigilance com
mittee had discovered a trail of blood
beginning at the scene of the alleged
"winging" and leading over a hill and
up a ravine that paralleled the Para
dise and Marysville road. Four miles
from town the blood had .ceased to
bo visible, but the foottracks continued
onward until they lost their Identity in
a well-worn trail, which led directly
into Paradise.
An hour later the "doctor" had re
ported to the committee that he had
just finished dressing a gunshot wound
iu the leg of "Kentuck" Randall, the
worthless proprietor of a worthless
claim at the lower end of the Flat.
During his residence in camp Ken
tuck's distinguishing: but Incongruous
characteristics had been a disinclina
tion to work and a surprising ability
in producing funds with which to buck
against "Parson" White's faro bank.
The doctor said Kentuck's Injury, ac
cording to hla own story, had been
sustained while he was extracting a
load from his gun, but he had seen
the weapon and he didn't allow that
shotguns ordinarily carried 41-caliber
bullets, and the doctor's practice being
largely confined to casualties inflicted
with this class of projectiles, his words
vere not without weight.
Two hours later, while a portion of
the committee commiserated with the
luckless Kentuck, another section of
that righteous body succeeded in un
earthing. Just back of his cabin, a
email but varied assortment of cans
and bags, all filled with dust and each
bearing the private mark of some res
ident of the Flat.
Three hours later Randall had mads
a full confession of. his iniauitous
course and the Jury had retired to con-
Eider of and concerning its verdict,
leaving a guard at the malefactor'*
door. The disgust heretofore mentioned
became apparent during the retirement
of the Jury.
"Ef the dern skunk had gone over
and robbed the Placervllle stage it
wouldn't have been so bad," said Par
son White, who, by common consent,
was the leader of the committee, "but
he must be ongrateful enough to steal
from gents he has been iivin' with and
which has always treated him white."
The verdict of the self-constituted
jury was such a foregone conclusion
that its retirement was a. proceeding
more perfunctory than necessary and
the arbiters of Kentuck's destiny soon
returned to the cabin.
"Kentuck," said Parson White, "the
committee, sittin' In Its wisdom, has
decided that you've done the meanest
thing on earthâ you've stolen from
your friends."
"The special meanness consistin* of
the fact that I got their stuff before it
went Into your brace game." Interrupt
ed Kentuck. â¢
"The remarks is irrelevant and im
material," said the Parson, who was
not legally inexperienced, "but the
court is not disposed to deal harshly
with the defendant conslderin' he is of
few days and full of trouble. "Which I
was sayin', Kentuck, the Jury has
found you guilty of a heenious offense,
but these gents has got their money
l>ack, thanks to your foresight In bury
in* it where It could be found, and they
'will be lenient. Paradise Flat has
never hanged a man and don't want
to begin now "
"Tour sentiments does you credit,''
interjected the prisoner.
"So we've decided .vou can be shot
like a gentleman." continued Parson
While without noticing the interrup
tion.
"1 suppose there ain't no appeal,"
suggested Kentuck.
"There might be if there was anybody
to appeal to," responded the Parson,
adding apparently as an afterthought,
'â¢which there ain't."
"No, 1 thought not," said Randall,
meditatively. "Anyhow, I extend a
vote of thanks for your kindness.
Which one of you gents starts me ud
the flume, if it's any of my business?''
"That's been a sticker with the bovs.
Kentuck." answered the Parson. "You
see, none of 'em Jikes to plug a feller
what ain't allowed to draw in self
defense. It kinder seems like murder."
"It might have that appearance to
one who didn't understand the circum
stances," assented Kentuck.
"And so we've concluded as how
you'd better shove your own buck."
continued the representative of the
Flat's moral sentiment. "Any of the
boys will lend you a gun."
"Much obliged for the loan," said
the condemned man.
"Don't mention it," politely respond
ed the Parson. "You'd do as much
for any of us. Now don't think for
the world as how we are hurryin' you,
but It's gettin' late and most of the
boys has their chores to do." ,'.
"I understand," said Randall, t'and
I don't want anybody to be kept wait
in' on my account. Doc, will you
please tell me exactly where my giz
zard is?"
"Right here," said the doctor, step
ping forward and placing a finger on
tho blue woolen shirt directly over
Kentiick's heart.
"Thanks," said Randall. "I beg
your pardon, Doc, for havin' you fix up
my leg:, which I wouldn't have had it
dene If I'd knowed I wasn't goin' to
need it no more. By the way, I don't
suppose any gent has brought his bot
tle with him."
"Don't get sarcastic," said Parson
"White, as each man present promptly
offered a flask to the condemned.
Kentuck accepted the one proffered
by Bill Diggs, proprietor of the El Do
rado saloon, remarking that for once
in his life he believed he would like
bugjuice that wasn't half water, took
a long pull at its contents, then re
ceived from the Parson's hand a big
navy revolver and placed its muzzle on
the spot Indicated by the doctor.
"Good-by, boys," he said cheerfully.
"Here's hopin' for better luck next
There was a sharp report, a puff
of blue smoke ascended to the black
ened celling of the little cabin and the
crowd slowly and silently wended its
way to the El Dorado.
"From the spludge he's makin', Hank
must have a high-toned load on to
day," said a lounger in front of the
El Dorado one evening about two
months after the committee had in
duced "Kentuck" to effect his own de
mise. A few minutes later the speak
er's claims to prescience were fully
recognized, for Hank rattled up to the
door of the Flat's only hotel, threw his
lines to a hostler and, jumping down,
assisted to terra firma, with many a
gallant flourish, the daintiest morsel
of humanity Paradise had ever seen.
First a little foot was firmly planted
on the wheel, then about a sixteenth of
an inch of a bewitching ankle became
visible as Hank swung Its owner to
the ground, and as "Mam" Roberts
conducted her into the hostelry the
boys saw a petite figure and a profu
sion of golden curls, the whole appari
tion being clad In somber black.
Hank was Immediately Invited to
drink by the visible population of the
camp, and as the crowd lined up to the
bar the query, "Who Is Bhe?" as-
Balled him from all sides, but he wait
ed until the foothill dust was washed 1
from his capacious throat before he<
spolre.
"You fellers has got into & nice
box," he finally remarked, as he leaned (
his back against the bar. "She's Ken- (
tuck Randall's daughter and she's
come to look after her pap's estate." (
"Oh, Lord," groaned Bill Diggs. "Have \
another, boys; It's on me." .
"And you gents wants to treat her
white," Intimated Hank, accepting the I
Invitation, but taking no further notice .
of the interruption. "She's been tellln*
me all the way from Marysvllle what a <
good man her pap was, and, of course, \
I kinder had to agree with her, and I.
allow as how you fellers will stand in'
too when she ooens her bazoo. 8he(
says a kind friend of her pap wrote,
her about his passin' in his checks, but'
she didn't mention no names." /
"Fill 'em up again, Bill,", said Parson '
White. "I may as well tell you now,(
boys, It was me as wrote the little gal. (
I was chinnln' with the late lamented]
one day and learned as how he had an'
old woman and a kid in the States, and <
after his untimely takin" off I was look- /
in' over his things and found the gal's <
address. I didn't think it was any use
sayin' anything to you boys -about it,
but I Jest set down and wrote her as
how her dad had had an accident with
a shootin.iron and had blew hisself to
kingdom come, but, of course, I "didn't
calculate on her comin' out to take

Mosc Jacobs, .whose trade had hitherto
been confined mainlx to bacon and rub
l>er boots, was kept 'busy disposing of
bis six shopworn white shirts at fabu
lous prices. In fact, the demand for
these linen evidences of civilization so
far exceeded the supply that a bargain
was entered into with Mam Roberts,
who agreed to detain the young lady at
the table as long as she in conscience
rould, and there was not one of the
newly purchased garments that did not
da duty a second time, somewhat to
its detriment but greatly to the edifica
tion of its fortunate wearer. Then the
Flat, conscious of the fact that it had
done itself proud in a sartorial way,
drank long ar.d deep at Bill Diggs'
well-springs of joy and waited in tre
mendous anxiety for the' morrow.
The next morning Miss, â ' Randall,
through Mam Roberts, expressed " a de-'
sire to meet Parson White, â  who " she
understood, was the lea*ling/Citizen;^of.
Paradise Flat, as well as ajfew- more
of the prominent inhabitants/There
fore an hour later the Parson, with five
lesser lights (there being only six white
shirts in camp), marched: into the little
parlor, where each man exerted him
self to get behind his fellow,- the â  re
mainder of the Flat waiting the while
at the El Dorado to hear the result of
the conference. When the landlady, in
her best style, had performed the intro
ductory ceremonies the young lady,
who to the deputation of leading citi
zens bore the appearance of a blue
eyed, golden-haired angel, murmured a
few broken words of thanks to them
for the kindness which she knew from
their appearance they had extended to
her poor, dear papa, whereat each
member of the delegation felt strongly
disposed to exercise his pedal extremi
ties, not only on himself, but upon his
neighbor as well, as his mind reverted
to the past.
"Now to business," she finally re
marked. "Poor papa sent us so much
money while he was alive that'mamma
and 1 knew he must have left quite
an estate, so I concluded to brave the
hardships of the journey and come
out to take charge of it. Do you
know which bank he put his money
in?" â¢
"Parson White's" â began one of the
boys, but he was interrupted by a kick
in the shins and a volley of ferocious
looks and discreetly subsided.
"The gentleman was about to remark
that they had appointed me to be
spokesman." said the Parson. "I don't
really think your father put his money
.into any bank. You see, we ain't got
no banks here and the boys mostly
takes care of their own money."
"When they are lucky," muttered
one of the delegation.
"Then pqssibly papa burled his 1
money," suggested Miss Randall.
"Possibly/* gravely assented the en-"
tire crowd.
"He was successful, was he not?"
queried the girl.
"Well, fairly," said the Parson.
"When the other boys done well, he

"But didn't he have & good claim?"
asked Miss Randall.

LIFE
AS AN
AFFAIR
OF
HONOR
happiness Is to be 'our sole endeavor. *
Far nobler it is to conceive of life
as an affair of honor. For that concep
tion Is, first of all, an appeal for forti
tude. Because we are \ placed here to
work out our own' salvation we ; are
not , to ,whlne when misfortune . comes
nor to shrink from losses, : defeats : and
disappointments. We are to bear ud
under them as the soldier, calmly en
dures hardship - and peril. - We are â¢ to
burn our own smoke, because It would
be 'dishonorable^in^us ". toj doj anything

through his effects?"
"Certain," vociferously shouted the
entire six. In fact they would havÂ»
cheerfully undertaken the task or
jumping across the canyon if she had
requested It. Then they returned to
the El Dorado with the understanding
else,' recreancy, to- what Is expected
of us. â¢
Again It Is â¢ an appeal for magnani
mity.. If we are . really here to play
the part of honorable men and women
we can afford to overlook . apparent
slights and wrongs, because all these
when, meekly taken strengthen and
perfect character. We can refrain
from answering back, from returning
unkindness for unkindness. What Is
shabby treatment, what are baseless
accusations, compared with keeping
our own record clean and . fine and
magnanimous? . .
-And; still again this conception of
life as an affair of honor Is a mighty
appeal for achievement. Just because
we are given such large latitude, just
because we are made In the image of
God with divine capacities, Just be
cause we are permitted to think and
talk -and act : as , we â  please, â  we ' are
bound to do something and think
something from day. to .day that is
worth -while.; We are bound -to be
doers, â  not parasites or drones. No

"There's only ona way out of this
thing," said Parson White, after the
story had been told. "In course, Ken-
didn't leave no estate, leastways
or his own, and so he's got to have one
made to order. I'll start it with a
hundred."
So saying he slapped a bag of dust
on the bar. â¢
'That's the talk," shouted a score
of voices and in almost no time every
raan present had added a donation to
Kentuck Randall's estate. A delega
tion was appointed to seal the pile In
an old can.*nd bury it in the dirt
floor of the cabin and soon the task
was reported as duly performed.
Early in the afternoon the hajf doz
en prominent citizens called for Miss
Randall and solemnly escorted her
down the hill to her father's cabin.
The girl shed a few tears as she gazed
on. the walls of the dreary hut, â¦ but
these evidences of grief were soon
dried as the men, under- her direction,
searched everv nook and corner of the
place. At last she gave the order to
dig up the floor and a dozen willing
hands seized half as many shovels and
for several minutes dug in every place
but the right one. â¢
â¢* "T^ain't â  jio use." said one of the
workers, finally, throwing down his
shovel, "there ain't nothln' yer'e."
v But at that moment a shout from an
other perspiring but. cheerful laborer
drew everybody to his side. He had
uncovered the can, which was soon cut
open and its contents dumped out on a
table.
"How much is there?" eagerly in
quired the heiress.
"As nigh as I can calc'late by lookln*
at It, there; is. clps^osto .seventhousani
dollars, and all your*n,* # -said thÂ© Pap
son, and at his words Miss Randal]
gave a glad cry and fainted.
But Joy Is never fatal except la ito-t
ries. and the young lady was soon la m
condition to be taken to the hotal, acÂ«
companled by the precious can and
every man In camp.
The next morning: before the stag*
left she made them a little speech of
thanks for their kind assistance, and
there was not a donor to the estate of
Kentuck Randall, deceased, who did
not feel fully repaid for hl3 contribu
tion. At the last moment Parson
White announced that he was going:
along to protect the youn* lady and,
her valuable treasure, and, although
Hank Dillard said privately that so
long as Kentuck was dead, the stage
"didn't need no protecttn*." yet the
Parson allowed he needed a trip any
how and the boys applauded his gener
ous action.
Two weeks later Bill Diggs, with &

"And you had got the better of him.

"Well, that's the way it ' looked to
him. The horse I let hTm have died
that night. He asked me if the horse
was sound and I said I never had
heard any complaint, and I hadn't. He
had never been under the care of a
doctor so far as I Rnew. His appetite
was cood and he'd Bat his eye when
you motioned at him. I might have
seen him fall down â have .seen men

and reverent* If this were not so, what
would bo the object of carefully putting
away the- delicate piece of transparency
in lavender until tome one else in the
family has need of it? If it does not
seeni a necessary part of the wedding'
gown, it at least has a charming mysr
tery for the bride-to-be that is created
by no other detail of her wedding cos
tume.
But notwithstanding all this it is a
paying proposition for one to be abso
lutely certain that the veil does not*
mar one's looks. There are scores, and
scores of old superstitions concerning
brides and their attire, but it -seems
as though it was getting just a bit too
primeval to insist on putting on the
tulle for the first time alter every
thing else is in readines for it. One
is not capable of judging at such a
time, and the excited family flying
about suggesting this, that, and the
other thing, are not good critics either.
It may be all very well and good to
keep the all-important frock tucked
away in the darkest corner of the
â ase for fear an evlleye might searcn
It out and cast a spell of misfortune
upon It, and it may not come amiss to
prevent the bride' from sewing one
stitch or. clipping one basting" thread,
for fear she may cut her happiness in
twain, burl fail to see where it could
place a kibosh of any kind upon her
ladyship to gather- the fragile fabric
into her hands and see ,for herself
whether the effect is pleasing or other
wise. â>; ; '::'i^:x
The gown is tried on, so why should
the tulle be relegated to the cedar chest
until the* eleventh, hour?; Surely the
gods ought to pardon, this one breach,
for if one ever wants to look pretty it
is on one's wedding day, and every
thing should, be done to enhance the
beauty that nature * has seen fit to
withhold or bestow.
The bridal veil is guaranteed to add
half a dozen years to anybody's age,
unless, perhaps, it is. the lassie. yet in
â her early .teeiis. -The regular featured
blonde or brunette who Is still in her
youth, or who by some mystic power
has the blessed faculty of making her
friends think she is, is the>one who
should hold up her ..hands in holy
horror at the very idea, of discarding
the white symbol, for she rarely If
ever fails to convey the Idea, that she
is of angelic temperament, and this
little impression, by the way, is in-
finitely more lasting and reaches far
ther than one wots of. .
The small girl who is rather inclined
to be too round is foolish to ever
â¢dream of a veil for a' single minute.
Caught at the very back of the coit
fure and flowing: about in a careless
, fashion never makes one appear, slend
er, and the plump girl is promptly
called "squatty," and even "a small
tub," by sonie of her admiring friends
and relations. To wear it really well
one should be what the French call
svelte, or in other words, slender- and
prettily rounded. To this rule there is
but one exception and that is the girl
who has managed to keep her childish,
jlemure stvie of beauty and who^ iin-
presses .all who see her that she is the
very essence of innocence and fresh
sweetness.
Under' the most favorable conditions
veils are trying things to handle, for
they never fail to act as though they
had been lightly touched by the imp ol
mischief. When they fall gently down
over the face the back spreads out sixty
ways for Sunday, and when the back
effect is pretty and : soft the front flies
willy-willy over, the face and ruins
what otherwise would have been an ex
tremely attractive picture.
True,_^ some brides are wearing ,the
veil thrown back from the face, and
in that, event; they may be. daintily ar
ranged, but does that convey the senti
mental idea that it has always por
trayed? The veil has stood as a.float
ing white symbol of purity and youth
and has been used as a covering for' the
face for generations, and generations.
If one departs from the Idea to that Ex
tent, why not dispense- /with it" entirely
and save the ' heartburns and bitter
tears of mortification that are the result
of hearing such' amiable llttle*speeches
as: "My, I never dreamed 'she, was half
as old ! Why? she looked a thousand
and four!" .
TffK SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALL,
The girl who wears a lovety gown
and.a wonderfully .becoming hat Is -the.
one who defies the .a
,wee. bit,_ perhaps, but. she' looks wonder- .,
fully sweet as a result, and she has
done the most sensible thing, in the
world. Besides this, she has displayed" 1
rare-good; sense. The" trouble is with,
the women, not the veils. Nearly every
daughter OT Eve fondly believes she
hasi the ability, to make herself look fit.
and nobody dares or, care enough about^
her- to convince her otherwise. -First 1
one arid then anothertells her why she
should wear, the tulle, but no 1 one. tells
her why it would be the better scheme
to. let it strictly-, alone. And the pity:
of it is_ she believes the Idle talk and
doesn't -take the trouble to find out
one way or the other for herself. As a .
consequence the veil is more a. mantle
ofcharlty worn to cover her imperfec
tions than anything else, and the girl
who. might have been pretty, is reduced
to the ranks of the commonplace. """
Tnne is uuming quite as retching: or
as softening as a large hat with plumes.
It droops into soft, pretty curves and

tistically that any girl can find one that
will make her frlend3 open their eyes
and wonder how it "happened they
didn't know she was half as attract
ive."
Just at present brides are in clover,
for almost anything is correct form.
Even colored frocks. And of all Inno
vations this. is the greatest and appa
rently the smartest. Certainly no one
could say the swagger Xew York girl
who was gowned in pink and attended
by maids in white didn't know any
better or that the bride in our own

provincial. Both knew what they were
about just as surely as does the lassie
who selects . a snfart tailor suit and

think it over well. â¢ Don't let any one
gently talk you into wearing the yell If
you are convinced in your own â  mind
that it adds one day "to. your age or
detracts one whit from your appear

precisely as you . please. If there is to

upon the fact that you are fully ten

whole is a satisfying little remem

nice and always acceptable and you
can make them for almost nothing.
Buy a yard-wide linen, say at tl or
$1 25 a yard, and draw your threads
so that the 'kerchief will be twelve
inches square. Hemstitch it and then
put on any trimming that pleases your
fancy and suits your pocketbook. A
pretty footing comes at 5 cents a yard,
and three yards 13 ample. Again an
other footing with a dainty edge comes
at 6 and 7 cents and you can get any
quantity of lace at 10 and 12% cents a
yard. â  To vary them use foottng, thin
lace and perhaps one with Insertion

will be both strong and altruist invis

kerchief klmonas are nice and service
able, too, and do not cost more than a
few pennies. For instance, bay a dim
ity at two yards for a quarter and
make a sewing apron of it. After a
short apron is fashioned put on a piece
about a third the length of the apron
itself, and divide that into three dis
tinct compartments. Featherstitch the
divisions and across the top for It
â¢makes a neater finish. Put on dimity
strings or ribbon, just as you like, but
the lawn washes better and is not half

appropriate for the girl whrf sews or

have the pockets tilled to running over

tween me and my be-it-ever-so-humble.
My $2 trunk, shipped ahead from Mem
phis, was in hock at the express office.
Next door I had pawned my last asset.
a wheezy silver watch, and I~ still
hoarded the few dimes, lest accident
befall the inwardbound banana fleet.
Even then my intellect, such as it was,
ranged far ahead sometimes.
Since the ships declined, to carry me
down to the sea there was nothing left
but to beat the ninety-mile stretch of
railroad between New Orleans and the
gulf. I performed this clever feat . by
limping along the track in light march
ing order, and thus got ahead of J.
Plerpont Morgan for the first and' only
time in my life. I'll bet it would sting
him now if he knew it. Three days and
15 certs' worth of gingerbread were con
sumed in this spiritedi dash to tide
water and a new life on the rolling
deep. My only preparation for the jour
ney was to take a farewell peep at the
trunk in the express office and time the,
Btart by the three golden balls next
door. i
Nothing that Mr. Morgan has since
handled-in the way of stock was watered
like this road. Much of the way it
wormed through cypress swamps like a
pair of snakes crawling along on stilts.
Trains were few and not at all keen, so
I ran little danger from that source.
The heat of noon late in spring blazing
down upon the track enticed the alli
gator from his winter hole, and he some
times disputed the right of way on the
solid levels. Many a time was I moved
to kick a $30 traveling bag out of one
of those sodden beasts: but what's the
use? I argued. With nothing to put in
it the bag would merely retard my pro
gress. Sherman's march to the sea was
but a matinee stroll down Broadway in
plug hat, cane and spats.
The first night out I slumbered fit
fully in an -abandoned handcar house
that stood on piles beside the track.
Before evacuating the . premises Mr.
Morgan removed the floor and three
Bides. Along the remaining wall he left
c board seat about one foot In width;
on which the Dago section hands were
wont to rest when weary with earning
their little old 90 cents per day. On this
board I slept, while the Southern star
shone in where the roof used to be. Mr.
Morgan took that, too. I never learned
the depth of water beneath the house,
and it wasn't my fault. All night long
I dreamed of sleeping on a clothesline

or two on de side, and keep me hand

Well, I says to Tommy, dat If he
was feeling like he knew enough about'
de boxing trick to do it without gloves,
and wanted to feel how hard a Rus
sian's head was, to get a night off
and come wit. me.
It didn't take me long to: locate de
game. I went down to de place kept
by. me fren de barkeep, where I meets
a felly who's an interpreter in a court,
and can speak all de Yiddish lingos,
and he j tells me where a Nannychist

about, as me fren de Jap was a stn

De meeting was in a cellar saloon.
A pretty chap, mit whiskers beginning
at his eyes and ending at his belt line,
and who had de "smell of de steerase
Btrong'on him, was making de prin
cipal â¢ talk. De interpreter puts us
wise as ito what he was saying, and,
say; he was^ fierce. He said he'd been
in ( de country already for more dan
tw.enty-four hours, and had been in
sulted by de police, had, to pay car fare
on de trolley line, had been chased by
a baker for lifting a loaf of bread

and murderers â and he wanted to
know what fell kind of a country dis
was, anyway.
I taught dis was pretty hot stuff,
but" de interpreter told us. to wait until
and didn't appear. to regret it, either.
Hotspur was perplexed but not de
feated. He had a vague idea that there
was something wrong. sc-me\y,here but
he couldn't exactly locate it and he
wasn't willing to believe that it was in
his original proposition. Probably the
people in this particular place hadn't
heard that old men were out v.f fashion;
as soon as they had received the glad
tidings they would hasten to . put all
their veterans on the retired list and
invit-*. young Hotspur back to take
charge of the business. Meanwhile, it
was necessary for him to look for some
more up to date place.
But surely there must be some place
where they were sitting up nights
waiting for the young blood to start
flowing in their direction. A sudden
idea struck him. He had it â or them!
mightily from thirst. Nor was the gin
gerbread diet any too juicy. At the
rate I traveled it was comparatively
easy to drop off at stations for the pur
chase of supplies without fear of get
ting left.
The gingerbread came and likewise
went in slabs at 5 cents each. In the
seafaring vernacular of that region, the
bread was known as the stage plank,
owing to its outward similarity to the
landing stage lowered from the bows
of steamboats. In size, weight, color
and shape the stage plank more ac
curately imitates the bland building
brick. While making no special effort
to economize, one brick carried me
through an entire day. My parched
salivary glands, allied to f the want of
water, rendered eating a positive painâ
a condition quite abnormal in a boy.
One bite of brick to the mile was the
average rate of consumption; and if
the divine scribe who wrote about
straining at gnats and swallowing cam
els had ever been up against the Lou
isiana \itage plank, he would doubtless
beg leave to amend, adding, "and stage
planks" to camels.
Ever and anon I flagged a sky-blue
cistern, buflt of staves on top of the
ground, and lapped up a gallon, or so
of rain water with pollywogs in it.
Then, like Mr. Christian, of whom John
Bunyan wrote, I proceeded on my jour
ney, vastly swelled and feeling and
looking much the same as a Philadel
phia alderman on a junketing trip with
the Liberty, bell.
The pious thoughts pervading these,

learn from this fact h' t st to sense
of shame,he was.
He hadn't definitely, determined what
position he would accept In the fourth

be something pretty good. He was a
college graduate and could read Latin
For the night the section boss stowed
me in a vacant bunk in a sort of . bar
racks where he housed the hired men.
The lawful proprietor, of the bunk had
gone off to ,get drunk and make a night
of it, but about 12 o'clock, while my
racked and weary frame was wrapped
in slumber, the drunkard came back
and claimed his bunk.
This Incident disappointed me in more
ways than one. I was a little blue rib
mon worker, had attended Francis
Murphy's temperance lectures at Mud
ville, 111., and signed the total abstin
ence pledge every night for two weeks
under la. different name, just to help the
cause along. According to' tradition the
drunken Dago should have slept in the!
gutter, and there was plenty of gutter
for him, too, in ditches on either side of
Mr. Morgan's railroad. But that; degen
erate boozer raised such a fuss about
his bunk, making no allusion whatever
to gutters, that the boss came forth
with a lantern to.look us over.
He didn't seem to think so much of
me then, but he was too good-hearted
to kick me out into the night, which
had turned cold and wet. So, grumbling
some, he gave me another room in the
henhoufe. . The hens clucked and
blinked' in the lantern light and colled
their feet a little tighter around the
roost, awhile , I huddled down in a cor
ner. Still feeling glad for. any kind of
favor, I folded my hands' and started to

Nobody didn't seem to know, for
dere was no answer. De star glares
at de crowd, and says, "And what, I
ask, Is de emblem which de poor ser/s
of dis country worships, dough it is
de symbol of deir slavery to a social

a little American flag and he uses It
for something he didn't have in his

Well, I soaked him. Jist as de
crowd toined to see what he held up,
and began to jeec it and cheer him
for de use he made of it. I soaked
him. Maybe In all me life I give a

de interpreter had jumped from de

didn't see Tommy, but I heard him.
I don't rightfully j know what he was

seemed to be going all over de room

head on de floor so regular and strong
dat de sergeant of police near fell
and Greek, with the aid of a dictionary
and notes, and he had taken a prize
for an essay in his senior year on the
"Decline of the Drama." If that didn't
entitle him to a high place then there
weren't any places of that kind In the
market. Our heart fails us as we at
tempt to chronicle what happened in
that newspaper office when young Hot
spur dawned , upon it. He wasn't en
tirely killed but for a few minutes he
thought that he could hear the angel
chorus. The city editor was actually
on the. point of giving him a try at a
dog fight or a fashionable wedding
when the budding journalist announced
that he thought that he would rather
write editorials. The city editor didn't
burst, but he was severely tested. In
the midst of the suspense the office
boy gave Hotspur the tip and that
say, "Now I lay me." Then, thinking
this might encroach too heavily on the
good nature and hospitality of the
hens, I burst into a chuckle of laughter
all by my lonely in the dark.
That I could laugh at all in those
damp and dismal surroundings did
much to comfort, strengthen and sus
tain me. A saving sense of the, ridicu
lous is an important adjunct to the suc
cessful hobo. Without it many of them
would never take the road. Instead
they would stop at home and become
deacons and trustees and prominent
citizens, who sit on the platform at
public functions.
Early in the morning I took leave of
the hens and limped away on the last
lap of the journey to the Gulf. The
night In the hennery had given me

I quite forgot my original aching joints
and parboiled heels- . I made a fare
.well demonstration at the cistern, tak
ing in a supply of water while the
boss was looking, but this time he
chopped on the bread and cheese. Still
I had enough stage plank to carry me
through, and the prospect of getting
somewhere that day stirred me with
unusual ardor.
Which was but natural in one well
raised, I desired to spruce up a bit be
fore flashing into Morgan City. Even
the rummiest hobo makes an . occa

ON THE HIGHER LIFE
RESIDENT William Rainey Har-
Ppier of the University of Chicago

.higher life, accordlnc to Dr. Harper's
Convictions, unless it has, its founda
tions firmly rooted in an Implicit trust
and faith in an exalted religious belief.
In the first address of the series.
which gives the title to Dr. Harper's
took. Chicago's president defines the
relationship between religious thought
snd the other components of Uie higher
life, the arts, the sciences, ethics and
philosophy. While repudiating the con
tention that religion is the fostering
parent of ail these activities of the
trained Intellect, the essayist maintains
that though an impulse apart from
every other esthetic endeavor, religious
spirit Is in its totality all-embracing:,
all-satisfying. Art, science, ethics and
philosophy cannot be well balanced
without the lecven of religion.
In drawing n } s conclusion from the
facts he has advanced Dr. Harper
shows himself to be a latitudinarian of
the broadest stripe. "The religion of
Jesus Christ is a religion capable of
adjustment to any and every individual,
however peculiar his temperament,
however exacting his demand." Again
he says, "I do not urge upon you any
form of religion, for I have in mind Its
very essence, that which is common to
all forms." In strange contradiction to
these dicta, however. Dr. Harper fol
lows in a succeeding address with a
plea for* the cultivation of religious
worship in the collegesâ worship, as he
defines it. being the unanimity of ritu
alistic practices -which binds individual
religionists into a unit. How reconcile
the universalism of the essayist's re
ligious conceptions with his demand for
aggregate worship among university
students?
-. 'â  "The religious side of Instruction
must not be ignored or treated half
heartedly," says the president of Chi
cago in his address on 'â¢Religious Be
lief in College." And again: "And
finally there must be specific teaching
of definite character adapted to individ
ual needs apd necessities. This calls for
chairs of Bible instruction in every in
stitution." Is Dr. Harper's recom
mendation in tune with his theory? If
every man is open to choose his re-
Hglous beliefâ to be a church in himself
if he 50 wills itâ can his independence
profit by set Instruction? Has there
ever been a theological school which
molded the thought of Buddhist and
Calvinist, Greek orthodox and Friend,
under the same regimen of instruction?
If the. semi-official religious training
that Is now being given students of
universities through Christian associa
tions makes in the end, as it surely
does, for the Insistence upon dogma
more cr less allied with the tenets of
certain religious bodies, could official
ecafiemlc instruction, sanctioned and
supported by university regents, do
aught else?
Dr. Harper's universalism cannot be
. put Into practice. The â¢weight of. opin
ion to-day Is that the public university
must be divorced from any programme
cf religious training If It Is to achieve
broad independence of thought and
spirit. The Bible is studied as litera
ture with profit; religious schemes en
ter Into the scope of philosophical stud
ies as material for consideration In the
abstract. Beyond this the province of
the modern university cannot, accord
ing to present opinion, have place.

DUNBAR
in Verse and Story
PERHAPS the reading world did
not realize what Btore it set by
the work of the colored singer of
songs and teller of tales, Paul
Laurence Dunbar, until death
recently' came very nigh to him
and threatened his musical tongue
with feil^nce. Unique in the literature
of the day is this figure, the only col
ored man, who has raised himself to
the position \)t being Interpreter of the
spirit, of his race in the measures; of
verse. In. his prose, but better in his
poetry. 'Dunbar gives to us the very
crseuce of the ideals and the common
places of . the, darkles; the lights and
shadows, primitive and without com
plexity, .that mark their lives. His
two last published books, "The Heart
of Happy Hollow," and "LIT, Gal."
fiction the one and verse the other,
represent Dunbar at his best.
"The Heart of Happy Hollow" is a
volume of/ sixteen short tales, some
in dialect, which have to exploit the
features that mark the daily round in
Darktown. With one or two exceptions
the stories are all first class; these
exceptions mark the author's effort to
break with the atmosphere that is his
by right an<J to' draw inspiration from
the world beyond the confines of the
colored man. It is when he chooses
gome comedy from the lives of his
race-fellows and delivers it in the Ir
resistible dialect of the " 'foh de war"
eunty or uncle that Dunbar excels as
a story teller. Humor has quick recog
nition at his hands and the vagaries
of Miss Cicily. Jones or Bruvver Hay
ward la their new-found freedom and
equality before the law make for him
rich material! "A Matter of Doctrine,"
which recites how a certain colored
pastor and leader of the flock put the
dogma of foreordination Into profitable
practice, is, I believe, one of the clever
est and most amusing negro dialect
stories written.
Dunbar is better at verse. In this
medium, where all his instinct tune
fulness has opportunity to. assert It
self, tho colored writer can reflect
directly the negro's innate love of song.
The soft dialect lends itself to the
delicacy of harmony and rhythm per
fectly. All of this syncopation ami
rag-time jarring and muddling of
words which passes current on the
vaudeville stage shows its ugliness
when compared with the softness and
lilting smoothness of Dunbar's real
dia.!e<;t verse. The present volume.
"LiT Gal," is largely a compilation of
the random Bongs that the poet has
published in magazines during the past
ten years. It includes the well known
"When de Co'n Pone's Hot" and the
sweet lav, "When Sam'l Sings." Here
is a verse from "A Florida Night,"
which sin^s ' Dunbar' s sweetest:

|>k a handsomely printed and bound
volume of 430 odd pages, "Our
West Indian Neighbors." by title.
Frederick A. Ober tells a great deal
about the American Mediterranean
that will he new to most of us.
Though he tells it with little pretense
at anything but a clear, straightfor
ward narrative style and lacks, per
haps, an eye for the picturesque and
the beautiful, Mr. Ober's book i3
valuable for the vast amount of facts
about little known spots of the West
ern hemisphere which it contains.
The author carries his readers
straight thrpugh from the Bahamas
off the Florida coast down to Trinidad
and the Dutch islands fringing the
northern shore of Venezuela. In
each group he treats of the history of
the peoples, their origin and their so
cial and economic life; a survey of the
topography and products of each
cluster of Islands is given and a
description of the cjties and points of
interest situated therein. To this
somewhat categorical scheme of the
guide book Ober adds a fund of anec
dote and personal reminiscence which
relieves his work of the strict formal-
Ism of a book of travel. In many In
stances statistics gathered by the au
thor himself while serving as a com
missioner of the Columbian Exposi
tion give the volume the value of a
practical book of reference.
Cuba, with which the author seems
the most familiar, receives lengthy
consideration. Several trips through
the Island, both â  before and after the
emancipation from the Spaniard,
made Ober thoroughly familiar with
the type of people In whose hands
government is now entrusted and of
these Cuban ex-patriots he writes at
length. He credits the native Cuban
with but mongrel pedigree and with
an order of intelligence lower than the
average. True, the newly emanci
pated citizen of a free republic does
not drink to excess, nor Is he thievish
in Ober's eyes; but he Is Irredeemably
wedded to the obsolete past In his
every walk of life and even to-day he
is the slave of the coldly calculating
Spaniard. The Spaniard Is still the
man of affairs in Cuba.

CHILDREN
of New York Ghetto
THERE has been no brighter book
than 'Myra/ Kelly's "Little Citi

drollery and downright fun this
collection of short tales about

cannot be surpassed. The dialect

tle Citizens," on the other hand, the
clever young writer has to offer only
the little comedies of life and thought
that fall among the children there. As
teacher in one of the settlement schools
Miss Kelly found herself in the very
midst of the strangest miniature
world of mingled shrewdness, world
ly, wisdom and innocence â a replica
of the World of the elders. There in

A STUDY
of Our Immigrants
{{ a MPORTED Americans," Brough-
I ton Brandenburg's study of
1 some phases of immigration,
I3 a bock filled with good ma
terial. Though the author de
signed to show some of the economic
and sociological aspects of the great
flow of aliens into this country, which
Is yearly becoming more and more a
subject for grave consideration, the
scientific 'vorth of his book- is over
shadowed by the weight of human In
terest incorporated therein. The type
of the Immigrant rather than the sig
nificance of his coming here is what
Interests the reader most.
Believing that good material lay "In
gutting the immigrant's point of view
to compare with the public-spirited
American one," Mr. Brandenburg de
termined to become one with the Ital
ian immigrant and to catch from that
position an appect with which the
great mass of the American' people Is
unfamiliar.- To that end the author,
accompanied by his wife, went to live
for- f everal months : in â  the crowded
Italian tenements of. the East Side In
New 'York. Having acquired there
sufficient familiarity with the language
to insure the success of his scheme,
he went by the . uncomfortable steer
age route directly to Italy, the source
of supply. After haviny made a study of
the peasant life throughout the poorer
districts of Italy, he attached himself to
a Sicilian family, that was contemplat
ing a voyage to .America, and with
them he. made the , tedious voyage
a cross the;* ocean and passed through
the tortuous channels of Ellis Island.
So much for- the author's quest in
search of material. That it was pro
ductive of some very strong convic
tions Is apparent' throughout the book.
His dominant belief is that the Italian
immigrant as at class is endowed with
qualities muking for the best citizen
ship.' He admits, however, that the
leaven of bad existing is sufficient to
sour the whole dough. To obviate
this the author would have inspection
THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALU.
and restriction put upon immigrants
in their i"vn country, rather than at
the rxirttls of America. He believes
that an itinerant board of examiners
should first seek principles by going
to the very roots of immigration
sources and there passing upon the
aualihcations of â  would-be citizens of
the republic.
More convincing than this rather
chimerical scheme. for the regulation
of immigration is, the author's draw
ing jf the type 'that represents Italy's
contribution' to our hodge-podge na
tionality. It was his experience that
throughout the whole agrarian' popu
lation America Avas synonymous^ with
the Promised Land of Biblical' lore.
Everywhere did he find it that^the
ultimate of individual endeavor was
emancipation from the tyranny of mili
tary conscription and the burden of
church tithes, and passage to the magic
land of the West. Significant is It,
according tp the author's deduction,
thjit those districts i the most rich are
the very ones which have contrlbuteu
most to the tide of immigration. A
family that has a representative In this
country is more fortunate than Its
fellows; a village that has contributed
many of its sons and daughters has
little debt to worry it. America is
measured by the dollar sign by all of
Italy's poor and Italy on its part profits
by the wholesale shipment of these
people to the Western land of oppor
tunity.

Egerton R. Young is a name well
known to all boy readers. This prolific
writer of books of adventure in the
north lands and,among the Indians, of
the Canadian Northwest, who draws all
his material from the fund of expe
rience furnished by long duty as a mis
sionary to the tribes, has now added to
the already long list of his juveniles
with a book which can be read by the
elders with no little profit. "Algonquin
Indian Tales." This book incorporates
a complete cycle of legends gathered
from the various branches of the Al
gonquin tribe, most of which center
about the mythological hero, Nanah
boozhoo, a mighty man and a very Pro
metheus for all the Indians of- the
north. In reproducing these folk. tales
of the savages the author has kept ad
mirably well the original spirit of
poetry resident In them; throughout
the entire length of the book th& spirit
of the woods and the solitudes is made
to breathe Its presence through the in
terpretations of the tales. For these le
gends, as tho3e of every primitive peo
ple, are In large part but the interpre
tation of nature's forces according to
the understanding of the rude wilder
ness dwellers.

"Strenuous Animals," being vera
cious tales of our furred and feathered
friends by Edward J. Webster, is Ern
est Thompson Setbn set to the measure
of roaring farce. 'While one Is Inclined
to wax exceeding tired with Mr. Se
ton's constant procession of straight
laced animals appealing to his lachry
mal ducts, I doubt If any person that
reads this book of uproarious mirth"
will gainsay the author's writing an
other like it, even though he may
switch his middle and last name in the
interim. The trained ferret that could
lay telephone cables, without tearing up
the city streets, the balloonist dog that
had the record, for 'sprinting, the elec
tric-motor frogâ these weird creatures
of Mr. Webster's creation have Thomp
son Seton "backed right off the map,"
to adopt the superlative of Uncle Billy.
Amusing Illustrations by Kemble and
Bob Adams re-enforce the risible at
tributes of the book throughout.

Among recent stories of adventure
Edward Stratemeyer's . book, "Under
the,Mikado'B Flag," claims precedence.
It relates the adventures of two young
Americana , in , Korea and ' Manchuria
during the outbreak of the \ great war
between Russia and Japan, the leading
character being Gilbert Pennington,
the hero of "On to Pekln," and the
other, Ben Russell, who, With his
brothers, Larry and Walter. Is so well
known to the thousands of readers of
the famous â  "Old ' Glory Series." It
closes with the great battle* of Liao
yang, arid- 1b as valuable j for j the in
formation conveyed as It is Interesting
as a story. * The boys of the whole
country have been- expecting Mr.
Stratemejer to give them a book on
the Japanese war, and he has respond

James Otis, the popular writer of
boys' juveniles, has produced a book
with a girl as the central figure. The
first Fourth" cf July, celebration, 5 when
Washington assembled his troops to
libten to the reading of the' Declaration
of Independence, Is the time of. this
exciting.-, story - for. children. Dorothy
Dean, the small daughter of -a patriot,
after seeing King George's statue
pulled down, and getting her best frock
spoiled by the crowds which even then
surged about in New York's streets, is
sent home for safety. But there she
and a playmate became involved in a
more seriou3 adventure with a British
spy. Thrilling events and' escapes fol
low fast in the story, but the ending ia
happy. The book is by a well-known
author of historical tales for children
and so closely has he woven this Into
actual incident that one cannot help
believing Dorothy to be as real a per
son as George Washington himself.

with "Our. State Legislatures." a vig
orous and searching analysis of the
characters and powers of these bodies
whose annual sessions begin so soon
in all the capitals qt the country, 'and
of the real dangers to be apprehended
from them. Henry A. Stlmson dis
cusses "The Millionaire's Peril"â a vig

tions and dangers of wealth â and
GeOrge M. Gould, II. D., contributes a
brilliant and philosophical paper on
the "Infinite Presence." In fiction,

says include "When "Least Aware," a
delicately told .and suggestive lovs
story bv ; Ellen Duvall; "Marlanus," a

QUEEN OF COSTERS
WHOSE LOVABLE TRAITS ENDEAR HER
TO HER "SUBJECTS" IN LONDON IS A
WOMAN OF WEALTH
SHE BLENDS. COMMERCIALISM AND CHARITY
Rickety Flight of Stairs Leads Up to r "Her Majesty's Palace"
LONDON, Dec. 10. â England poss
esses several queens besides the dis
tinguished woman who occupies the
throne with King Edward. To men
tion a few of them only, there is a
queen of the costers, a queen of the
gypsies, a canal queen and a "queen
cf the thieves." The last named, how
over, is at present in temporary re
tirement, owing: to -^grtu 4n-*dtfl!i tfW Jc f .i
with his Majesty's Government. Each
commands the loyalty of the commun
ity over which she rules for the time
being, and It Is only in most extraor
dinary cases that one of them is ever
deposed.
Such a queen is never an autocrat,
but governs democratically. The dig
nity is never self-imposed; in fact the
woman may go to bed at night plain
Mrs. Jones and find herself a queen of
her particular class the next morning.
This is how Mrs. Sarah Russell, thw
queen of London costers, was crowned.
A plain, simple, honest, hard-working
little woman on the right side of 40,
she is a conspicuous personality in cos
terdom. Looking at her no one would
imagine she could wield the influence
Ehe does over the rather tough com
munity in which she moves. She is
modest and unassuming and there is
nothing about her which would indi
cate that she Is the wealthiest woman
of her class in England.
HAS GOOD BANK ACCOUNT.
Her "palace" Is situated in a most
â¢uncongenial neighborhood, and one has
to climb a Bet of rickety stairs to reach
"her Majesty's" drawing-room. There
you will find her absorbed In a multi
tude of books and papers^in which the
Etate of her finances is primitively set
out. She Is sufficiently industrious to
dispense with the services of clerks or
bookkeepers, and it is the Commission
ers of the Income Tax only who can
pive anything like an approximate idea
of the etate of the queea's banking
account. It is hinted that she Is worth
at least $20,000 in hard cash and that
her yearly income cannot fall short of
52000.
The most substantial part of this in
come is derived from the hiring out of
barrows a.nd trucks to costercnongers
who hawk their wares through the
London streets. She controls over 300
of these trucks and barrows. They cost,
â when new, anything between J15 and
$50, and the usual charge to the hirer
is 25 cents a week.
The business to the unltlated , might
appear somewhat risky, because all
that is demanded of the person who
hires them is a deposit of 25 cents and
his name and address. Some of these
barrows are kept out â¢ two or three
years at a stretch, and in numerous
cases they are never returned to the
Etores until their usefulness is exhaust
ed or they require repair. The hiring
fees have to be paid monthly, and per
cons of doubtful honesty are kept un
der observation by the "queen" and
members cf her staff.
BEGAN IN HER YOUTH.
Mrs. Russell's confidential man
combines various duties. He deals
with prospective renters, takes their
cash and In his spare moments does
a bit of carpentry and smith work.
Moreover, he never fails to impress
upon one that he has from his boy
hood worked for and enjoyed the con
fidence of queens. He is a retired
non-commissioned army officer and he
is as loyal to his present sovereign,
the queen of the costers, as he was to
Queen Victoria during his thirty
years of army service. All the trucks
and barrows are constructed on the
premises and in the busy season,
â¢which Is between June and October,
employment is provided for a num
ber of wheelwrights, smiths and car
penters.
In her youth Mrs. Russell assisted
ber father and mother in the coster
: - st/Jtk
business, but since her marriage she
has been able to live an easier and
more comfortable life. She is now a
widow. Her husband had been a
coster from his boyhood and it was
mostly through his energy and indus
try that the present business was
built up. Since . left . to her own re
sources she has shown a grasp of the
working of the concern that aston
ishes people wlth ; wider., experiences.
She is acquainted with, every part
and every little detail In the con
struction of barrows and trucks and
neither smiths nor carpenters could
deceive her with regard to the quality
of their work.
HER CHARITABLE ACTS.
' She is an extremely charitable
woman to her class and it is this fea
ture in her character that has ele
vated her to the dignified and distin
guished position she enjoys among
the costers of London. If trade Is
bad or a coster has fallen on evil
times through some unforeseen cir
cumstance she will lend him money
to purchase the necessary little stock
of fruit, vegetables or some other
salable article that may enable him
to get on his feet again. When a
death occurs in the coster communi
ty she can always be depended on to
advance the money for the burial un
til there is time to get up the usual
"friendly dead" by which every cos
ter pays a little to defray the ex
penses of the funeral.
â  Mrs. Russell never misses one of
these sad processions . and it is only
on such occasions that she puts on
anything approaching style. Her well
equipped brougham is always In the
first flight of coster vehicles and al
though it bears no external marks of
royal distinction it is always pointed
out as" "the queen's carriage."^ At
coster, weddings, too, she is much in
evidence, and the happy pair can al
ways rely on receiving a substantial
and useful wedding present from her.
At such ceremonies she Is distin
guished by the quietness of her dress,
which is in striking contrast to the
cheap and flambuoyant finery affected
by coster women on these occasions.
BARROWS OF ALL COLORS.
'It is only In the colors of her barrows
that she shows any ambition to shine
in the coster world. These are painted
in all the shades of the rainbow, just to
suit the coster taste. Her name and
address are inscribed on every barrow
and truck, but there is no sign of the
royal arms anywhere. Although she
lives in the midst of a thickly popu
lated district,' her immediate neighbors
appear to be only a achoolhouse and a
dingy looking little church. There is no
record that society ever penetrated
within her dominions except when the
Marquis of Headfort married Rosie
Boote, a gayety dancer, at the little
church referred to. Mrs. Russell does
not forget - to , tell you that she was
present at that wedding â not as an in
vited guest, but as a spectator.
At ,the annual athletic sports of the
Costers' Association she occupies the
post of honor on the grand stand and
contributes liberally, to the prizes, espe
cially those for the donkey and barrow
races. . " .â â¢..;
BRIDGE STILL THE RAGE.
It is not expected that the denuncia
tion of the craze for bridge in so-call
ed high society will'have any apprecia
ble effect In abating indulgence In this
popular form of 'â¢ gambling. There is
one man who. could accomplish more
In the way of "checking it than- all the
clergymen' in the Church of " England,
were he so minded. If the t King were
to give up playing bridge and r exclude
it from the games provided for his en
tertainment 1 at the great. houses which
he visits the force of his : example

tremendous effect. But* he shows no

intention of denying himself the pleas
ure he #ets out of it.
During his recent sojourn at Glen
quoich as' the guest of Lord Burton he
played long every night, his partner
being Miss Jane.Thornewill, sister . of
Lady Burton, who rejoices in the repu
tation of being the best woman bridge
player in all Kngland. It has already
been announced that he intends to, re
peat his .visit next , yjear, to , bo eiiWT*
talned in similar fashion:
KING AN ENTHUSIAST.
As the King's "clerk of the closet,"
an office corresponding to that of fath
er confessor, and for which, by the
way, he is paid $55 a year, in addition
to his salary of $75,000 a year, the Arch
bishop of Canterbury is supposed to
be specially charged with looking after
the King's spiritual welfare. At the re
cent church congress in Boston no
suggestion, however, was made of ap
pealing to the King to lend his assist
ance to an antt-bridge crusade. Mean
while there is no doubt that the game
has revived the gambling mania to such
an extent that it is cutting deep into
fashionable finances. "Week-end parties
at the great country houses, which
used to be devoted in the main to
healthful outdoor sport and recreation,
now frequently serve as excuses for
bridge playing all day long and far
into the night, Sundays included. And
on Monday mornings, when the parties
break up, it is quite a common thing
to see the guests exchanging checks
for considerable amounts.. .
ENGLISH SOCIETY GOSSIP.
It is a coveted mark of distinction
among our feminine aristocracy to be
pre-eminent in the display of some va
riety \ of gems. The Duchess of Rox
burghe stands easily first in the mat
ter of turquoises, which are peculiarly
adapted to her. type of beauty. The
great bulk of them were collected be
fore her marriage, while she was still
Miss May Goelet. Buying here and
there and always displaying excellent
judgment in her purchases, she haa ac
quired no less than a hundred brooches,
pendants, earrings and bracelets stud
ded with these precious stones. They
were broken up after her marriage,
and she now wears them in the form of
a suDerb ornament. To complete it in
accordance with her design a few tur
quoises had to be added to those she
had already, obtained, but it took
months to procure. them and the best
European markets were ransacked , for
them, because her own maiden collec
tion of absolutely faultless
stones, perfectly matched In color, and
she would be content with none that
did - not conform to the same high
standard.
MRS. BONYNGE'S PLANS.
Next season will find Mrs. Bonynge,
mother of Viscountess Deerhurst, fixed
up in a London "residence which she
will occupy for the greater part of the
year. Since her recent arrival in Lon
don she 'has been exploring Mayfair
and Belgravia for a suitable house. In
both localities there are a considerable
number, of houses to let just .'now so
that it is easy enough to get a real
good establishment at a very moder
ate rental. Money is so scarce that a
number of people are letting; their town
houses and are moving into flats.' Thus
report- the fashionable real " estate
agents.
Mrs. Bonynge has just made an offer
for a house In Chesterfield Gardens, a
few doors away from Mrs. ? Bradley
Martin" and; Lady Craven. She has her
eye also on a ; magnificent residence/ in
Grosvenor Gardens in Beigravia, but "as

"with the provision that had been 1 made
for turning out these women fit and

a hope that Lady Deertiurst might one
day be able to direct a similar institu
tion. . .
This hustling American matron has
seen more of Essex during the . few
weeks, she has been there than her
daughter has. been able to in the years
she has been in England. Mrs.
Bonynge has motored to all the places
of Interest in the county, including
Claybury Lunatic Asylum, which is
supposed to be the most perfect insti
tution of its kind in Europe. She has
s"een Dr. Barnardo's homes at Barking
side and General Booth's farm for the
submerged tenth at Hadlelgh. She
went on to Osea Island, where the ex
brewer Charrington' is endeavoring to
convert aristocratic topers. She also
visited the old inn at Chigwell and saw
the old room where Dickens spent so
many pleasant evenings. Mrs. Bonynge
is so pleased with all the surround
ings in Essex that she expressed a hope
she could make it her, permanent home.
FINDS WOMEN IN CLUB
. ENJOYING A SMOKE
Military Man Reaches London From
India and Is" Shocked at What
- He Beholds.
LONDON. Dec. 10.â An amusing in
cident and one illustrative of the ra
pidity with which modern manners and
customs are changing occurred at the
new Lyceum Club for women In Picca
dilly on a recent Sunday. A military
man, with sun-tanned face and .fierce
gray mustache, stalked into the "main
saloon and seated himself near a "mix
ed" tea party. - From behind his
paper he glared for a few moments at
the women, who were smoking.' Then
he called a waiter and stormed under
his breath. The waiter fled and sent
an official. of the club to him! After
some mutual explanations the' old vet
eran strode out of the room,
bestowing a parting frown on its oc
cupants.
He had landed that morning from
India, and, unaware that the rising
feminine tide had engulfed the Im
perial Service Club, had hastened to
what had ' been his favorite hanglng
out place in the old days. But his sur
prise on discovering; it- no longer exist
ed was slight* to the shock he experi
enced on learning that during : his ab
sence smoking": had become a fashion
able'femiriine accomplishment.

and it would not be surprising if the

that such action will be taken. Official

MRS. LANGTRY
IS NO LONGER
A FAVORITE
Once Popular : Actress
' .: Sailing Upon Sea
of Trouble.:
LONDON, Dec. 10.â The fact that Sir
Henry de Bathe, whose eldest son mar
ried , Mrs. Langtry, will soon have an
other handsome daughter-in-law, has
set society to asking how this develop
ment will affect the Jersey. Lily, whose
lot, just at present, Is far from being
an enviable , one. -Hugo de Bathe's
younger brother has become engaged
to. the, beautiful' Violet Wood, who is
almost as well known to American as
to English society women. ; ,
ir Notwithstanding the extent to
which she once . had the , world at her 1
feet, Mrs. Langtry is now sorrowfully
watching the sea of admiration and 1
worship. recede from her. And the bit
terness of her, disappointment is leav
ing its mark upon her. .
Her beautiful home in Chelsea has
been given up, all the treasures with
which . it was crowded have been sold
off I and she - has taken ; apartments at
the Savoy Hotel to remain in the cen
ter of things.
As, If to supplement these private
troubles, Mrs." Langtry has been re
turning from race meetings with sto
ries of continued . losses.
"It; was the opening, night of .her last
fortnight's tour that brought to Mrs.
Ljangtry what seemed to her. to be tho
last straw. Used ,; as she always has
been when "opening" in the provinces
or in London to be 'overwhelmed with
letters and telegrams from old friends,
she waited In vain for word from them.

"CARMEN" WITH
A LIVE BULL
OPERA QIVEflWITH
REAL FIGHT.
PARIS, Dec. 10.â Spain Is usually re
garded as a alow sort of country, and
one does not expect that anything
startling in the dramatic line should
first see the light of day there; but it
must be acknowledged that a theatrical
manager of Valencia haa succeeded In
beating the record In the way of stage
realism.
Taking advantage of thÂ« blow struck
at the national sport by the "Sunday
rest" law. and the popular demonstra
tions against It, he conceived the bril
liant idea of performing Bizet's "Car
men" In the great bull-ring at Valen
cia with a genuine bull-fight In the last
act. 'Aflne beast was procured, torea
dors and matadors and all the rest of
the necessary outfit were engaged, and
the bull was slaughtered in the usual
fashion. ' Never before was a produc
tion of "Carmen" received with so
much enthusiasm.
Here and in America we have had
racing scenes with live horses and
Jockeys; and fires with real fire engines,
but they all pale Into insignificance
compared with the staging of a real
bull-fight. Enterprising Impresarios
state that legal obstacles will prevent
them from following the astute Span
iard's. example and ''coining money out
of the Idea.

SHAW in vaudeville!" I had said to
myself on seeing the Orpheum bill
boards. "It Is Impossible, my friend."
Had any one asked me who was the
last American actress I should expect
to find In vaudeville, from the repute of
her, I should have said "Mary Shaw."
For, though we have not seen Miss
Shaw In the Ibsen portraits for which
Khe is I'amous, the power and spell of
them have thrilled even to here In the
reading of them. But there It wasâ
"Mary Shaw." And then I saw her
last Sunday In the little sketch, "The
Silent System," high comedy for the
lady and a silence that might be but
is not in this Instance wholly eloquent
for the gentleman, carrying the Or
pheum, gallery and all, triumphant
ly with her. "And this Is Mary
Shaw," I thought, watching the charm
ing bit of unreasonable femininity she
paints. "Who would dream of a Mrs.
Alving here?" It was something of the
kind of difference between Mrs. Fiske's
"Hedda G abler" and her Cyprienne In
"Divorcons."
The nÂ«^xt day I saw her at home. We
had said just "how-d'ye-do," 4rawn up
our rocking chairs and then sat for a
moment looking at each other. Then
Mary Shaw's eyes â the artist eyes, ex
traordinarily wide apart â narrowed
quizzically, and she said: "It Is ab
surd. Isn't ltr*
I had been thinking so â her being In
vaudeville â but .to hear her drag my
thought Into the light was a little
ttartling. Miss Shaw is that kind of
person. She is the kind whom to meet
Is an epoch. Most nearly like Mrs.
Fiske she is than any one you can think
of. They were in the same company â
iliss Shaw in Mrs. Fiske's company.
"We used to settle the universe. Min
nie and I." Ehe lightly put It. But one
can imagine the dazzle and glint of
that greenroom gossip. For to extra
ordinary intellectual gifts Miss Shaw
adds wit. larse knowledge, much char
ity, the broadest artistic and human
sympathies and the keenest Intuition.
She went on with the vaudeville ques
tion, rocking gently, her eyes humor
ously glinting: "I don't know why
they want my kind of person In vaude
ville. It is odd. And then not to do
the kind of thing that. If I am known
at all, I am known for doing'! I was
playing: In 'Ghosts' and 'Hedda Gabler*
when they came to me. I asked If I
mighi not play a little thing of Gio
cosa's, 'The Rights of the Soul." They
assured me it was too serious for
vaudeville. Butâ" Mls3 Shaw's level
eyebrows lifted In doubt to the red
bronze hair misted above them.
"You think not?"
Indirectly 6he answered me: "You
know there Is not such a terrific dif
ference between audiences? The per
centage of the thinking among them
varies not bo greatly. Borne nightsâ
yes!" she smiled, "the variety audience
is sort of elemental, but I wouldn't be a
bit afraid now to give them 'The Rights
of the SouL* "
"How old a vaudevillain are you?"
"Seven weeks, Just," Miss Shaw re
plied. "Do you know," she looked at
me here with the eyes of a quizzical
sphinx, "do you know that you learn
lots of things from things that you
don't think you could! Ethically and
spiritually this experience has been a
singular discipline to me. I've been so
much on the ultra side of things, you
know. Here you get near people in
such different fashion. I was nervous
at first. 'Vaudeville audiences won't be
bored,' they told me, and I was afraid!
You have such a short time to make
good, no piling scene on scene to make
your effect. On, rush In, off, and it's
over."
"This, cf course. Is Just an adven
ture?"
"Just an adventure," she replied,
"like Jessie Mlllward's, Charles Haw
trey'sâ"
"Rose Coghlan's." I added, and with
the name came the consciousness that
It Is Miss Coghlan of whom Miss Bhaw
rather strongly reminds. You get It in
the warm fiber of the voice. In the mer
ry, Irish suggestion of the face In some
cf Its moods. In the big personal mag
netism.

cause of It. He s*aw how men thinned,
flattened out under temptation and
failed at need. He saw in them the

came from. Then he said to' himself,
'the woman!' He asked himself, 'how

Paderewski comes next Saturday aft

aroused by the Polish virtuoso. It is

The native American composer,
through Mr. Arthur FarweU's able and
energetic effort, is Just now attracting
considerable local 'attention. Let me
recommend an Interested glance in the
direction of Will Marion Cook, re
sponsible for most of the music of the
negro musical comedy "In Dahomey,"
now playing at the Grand Opera-house.
Will Marion Cook Is a Dvorak pupil
and a native American of the colored
variety. In "In Dahomey" he has given
us, particularly in the prelude, music
of a distinctly original flavor, vital in
quality and by no means wholly of the
ragtime brand. It has something of
a primitive Jungle thrill in it and sets
admirably the savage scene it is writ
ten to. Noisy, a good deal of the later
music is, trivial, stereotyped "coon"
stuff,. but there is plenty to repay the
attention of the serious student, and
most of it will hold the careless ear.
Lovers of chamber musio find always
something to delight in the Kopta
Quartet concerts. This afternoon's has
the lovely Schumann quartet (op. 41,
No. 1), with the adorable adagio. Then
for novelty there will be the Arensky
piano quintet (op. 51), that will be
given for the first time here. In thlsÂ».
as usual, the Koptas have the assist
ance of Mrs. Oscar Mansfeldt at the
piano. Other numbers are the Lachnpr
adagio, from op. 137, that is also
new, and the Cherublni scherzo from
the first quartet.
Chopin, Paganinl, Beethoven, Men
delssohn. Mozart by way of the banjo
Is the odd entertainmentâ alleged mu
sicalâthat Alfred A. Farland provides.
His admirers, a huge concourse, claim
that Mr. Farland'a kind of banjo play

banjoism. Those curious can find out
for themselves next Tuesday night at
Stelnway Hall, when the banjolst will

MALAPROPISM IN SMART SET
"How do you do. Count ? I'm
delighted to meet you. So you are
from Sweden? Well, really, I am glad
to meet you, because I always have
Swedish servants, don't you know, and
I like them immensely â so I know I
fball like you " This the warming
effusion of a doughty dowager of the
ultra smart Bet, on being presented to
a distinguished visitor to our Western
village -by- the-Bea.
"Oh. thank you. thank you," said the
elegant foreigner, appreciating the sit
uation to its fullestâ not being a
Briton. "I am delighted at what you
have said, and I chall immediately in
form my Government. It is one of the
primary objects of our Government to
train our girls to become good servants
for rich Americans. I am delighted that
we have succeeded in pleasing your

the proud Came acknowledged the
compliment and swept away to repeat
to her friends how Americans were
bringing "them foreigners to time, and
in Sweden they were training their
Kirls for American service." Of course.
no one had the key to the riddle until
the Count himself furnished It.
Exceptional? Perhaps, but MesdameÂ«
Malaprop abound in places least ex
pected to harbor them. Externally
they are usually well glazedâ in velvet,
often; and this winter black velvet and
white satin seem to be the especial
"fflddy shell" of their ladyships. 'TIs
only when speech becomes necessaryâ
and !t sometimes does, even In ultra
smart set affairsâ that the funny
stunts occur.
One that assailed my earsâ end
which unfitted me for duty for the
hourâ was a declaration to an eligible
chap of a proud mamma about- her
daughter. Now the daughter was un
deniably pretty, witty and somewhat
unconventional. We all knew the girl
had temperament, and often discussed
it, but it remained for the mother- to
clinch things by announcing to the
good-looking chap whom she sought to
impress with her daughter's charms,
*Mary" (which isn't her name) "is a
t-vely girl, only she's a little risky."
/he'd heard some one say "risque" and

To be sure, it's a vulgarismâ and an
unpardonable sinâ to criticize elderly
people who in their youth were denied
the privileges of education. That in
itself Is the purest phase of caddlsh
n'_j?s, but when those people who were
denied the privileges of education â  -t
themselves up as arbiters of society
and leaders of fashion they must not
hope that their shortcoming will go un
challenged.
And thus Is the crystallization of
San Francisco society well under way,
when cultivation, tact and intelligence
are looked for in polite circles, and
where gold alone doesn't hold sway.
Here's to the Swedish servants! And
that the Count may forget the story!
But of course he won'tâ it will make
good telling when he reaches the
fatherland.

the greatest display of splendor in all
America.
The Bohemian Club reception was an
interesting function. Love of the mystic
lies deep in the feminine breast, and
the delight of being bidden to stroll
through a club belonging to men was
good fun. But whispers were abroad
that a lot of fellows ran upstairs and
locked their rooms in most ungallant
fashion. Whether they feared the fem
inine invasion was "establishing a bad
precedent" or whether the bureaus
weren't in order 'tis hard to say. But
it was good fun anyway Just to look
about a man's club. And if Tuesday
night's air of dignified decorum always
prevails, then the Bohemian Club's a
Sunday-school, and a mighty nice one*.
As for the pictures in the Jinks room,
they did get some secondary attention
from the women guests. But they will
go backâ these women fairâ some after
noon and interview the pictures when
the men are not hovering about. How,
indeed, could women study picturesâ
inanimate.. _ things â when there were
loads of interesting men about and a
club with its seductive doors thrown
open â save those that were cruelly
locked?

NOVEL SPORT
OF FRENCHMEN
Steers Are Being Trained
to Take the Place of the
Horse in Field Events
AXBIALS INTELLIGENT
Favorite Mount of a Noble
man Is an Ox That Has
Been Broken to the Saddle
Special Dienatch to The Call.
PARIS, Dec. 10.â No longer ls the
steer to be regarded merely as so much
potential roast beef or as a slow-mov
ing drawer of cumbersome vehicles. In
genious Gallic sportsmen have discov
ered a new mission and a new dignity
for him. He is to be ridden like a horse
and to participate in racing, steeple
chasing and fox hunting. They have
proved that this beast, heretofore cred
ited with abundance of Innate "cussed
ness" but little Intelligence, ls capable
of all these things when properly
trained. Several races have been or
ganized to test their capacities, with
results that amply Justify the experi
ments now making, for the Frenchmen
concerned have taken the matter up se
riously.
Most successful In developing their
latent capacities ls a French nobleman
â who In sporting circles ls known as
"Le Baron Ch. C." His favorite mount
is an ox that can assume various gaits,
gallop swiftly over flats and leap nim
bly over obstacles. It obeys the rein
or the rowel as readily as a horse. The
bridle and saddle used with these rid
ing steers are similar In general design
to those used with horses, but the bit
is exceptionally powerful. For obvious
reasons It has been found desirable to
affix rubber pads to the ends of their
long horns. In one respect the steer ls
possessed of agility superior to that of
the horse â he can make a sharp turn
when going at full speed.
In a semi-wild state on the Western
plains the steer is capable of a good
turn of epeed, and at round-ups often
lead cowboys mounted on fleet ponies a
long chase. How far this may be Im
proved by Judicious breeding remains
to be seen. Heretofore the only object
aimed at by that means has been to
develop their beef qualities. The horse
in its present state ls the result of cen
turies of evolution directed by human
agencies. It is quite possible, French
scientists declare, that the ox ls cap
able of Elmilar development and im
provement and that the result would
be something vastly different from the
present breed.
It is well known that in certain parts
of Africa horses succumb so rapidly to
poisonous flies and other pests that
oxen only can be employed as beasts of
burden. In such regions it is evident
that there would be a demand for one
that could be ridden to saddle. In fu
ture punitive expeditions in these por
tions of the Dark Continent "steer
corps" may be employed by the British
army, just as now camel corps are used
In the Soudan. A charge of mounted
steers, with the pads removed from
their formidable horns, would suggest
to the ordinary man the desirability
of beating a hasty' retreat even quicker
than would a charge of ordinary cav
alry. Whatever may be the outcome of
it, the French experiment ls certainly
a novel and Interesting one.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, DECEMBER 11, 1904.
KEEPS THREE
AGENTS BUSY
Mrs. Potter Palmer's Search
for a House in London Is
Not Meeting With Success
ACTEESS HAED TO SUIT
Demands Accommodations
That Are Not Provided in
Houses for Kent in Capital
Special Dieratch to The Call.
LONDON, Dec. 10.â "As soon as
Christmas is over," said a prominent
real estate agent to the writer yester
day, "we expect to be kept busy finding
town houses for the number of Ameri
cans who are coming over to swell the
trans-Atlantic colonies in Mayfair and
Belgravia."
Mrs. Potter Palmer it seems has com
missioned not one, but three, of tha
most fashionable of the West End real
estate firms to secure her a house. It
is said that her object in doing this is
to create competition among the agents
so that she may obtain the best value
for her money. She has already estab
lished a reputation for being one of the
shrewdest business women outside the
Duchess of Roxburghe who has had
any dealings with these agents. She
will not have a house already furnished
âthe furniture, she says, hides many
defects: she will insist upon having
every nook and corner examined by
her own experts in building, construc
tion and sanitation. The scheme of
decoration in the houses she has al
ready seen is not up to the standard
of her tastes and requirements. They
are all too tinsel, she says. She wants
art combined with solidity. One firm
of agents thinks that she must have a
house specially built before she can be
accommodated. When she has found
the house she is going to do the fur
nishing herself, and in this connection
she means to have it principally In the
Parisian style. The heating apparatus
In the principal London mansions she
does not like at all. She will have the
American system installed if she can
get her landlord to agree. The general
impression is that she cannot get a
"season" house on her terms and that
in the end she will be obliged to have
a permanent residence if she means to
put up in Mayfair or Belgravia.
Another American woman who means
to set up a London establishment ls
Mrs. Bradley Martin Jr. She and her
husband are looking out for a house in
the neighborhood of Chesterfield Gar
dens, but at the moment it Is doubtful
whether anything is likely to be vacant
to suit them In this quarter. They
mean to make a stir in London society
next year, and much of the entertain
ing that has hitherto devolved on her
mother-in-law will be taken over by
the young bride. It is feared that the
English climate will not suit her and
that she must perforce spend much of
her time between New York and Paris.
She makes no secret of the fact that
she likes England, but she experienced
one or two fogs in London during vis-
Its which she had paid before her mar
riage that caused her to form preju
dices which it will take some time to
remove.

Interruption in the taking of evidence
in the Monnier will contest while an ef
fort is being made to throw the wid
ow's case out of court and have her
punished for contempt. Yesterday aft
ernoon George Monnier Jr., who is
trying to break the will of his reputed
father, filed an affidavit charging Anna
Monnier with irregularities in connec
tion with her deposition. The deposi
tion was taken on October 15 before
Notary Edna T. Keating. Afterward,
it Is set forth, a copy as transcribed by'
the stenographer, was given to Mrs.
Monnier to read and sign.
The affidavit charges that Mrs. Mon
nier has materially changed the deposi
tion and refuses to sign her testimony
as originally given. She has, it is
charged, stricken out questions and
answersi changed the language in
places and altered a portion of the tes
timony so as to give it a different
meaning.
The changes, it is declared, are writ

WOULD PROTECT
THE FISHERMEN
The sessions of the convention of
the International Seamen's Union of
America yesterday were largely de
voted to the considering of resolutions.
The cause of the fishermen was again
taken up and active legislation urged
for the protection of their interests.
In the future the fishermen will be in
cluded in all legislation looking toward
the betterment of the condition of sea
men. The preservation of the salmon
fisheries is first to be considered.
The establishment of a marine hos
pital for sailors suffering with rheu
matism will be urged at the next ses
sion of Congress.
A resolution was adopted favoring
the passage of the Hearst bill, em
powering the Interstate Commerce
Commission to fix reasonable rates
and establish an Interstate Commerce
Court to review such pleadings as shall
be appealed from the commission.
In the evening the delegates were
the guests of the unions of the Pacific
Coast at a banquet in a downtown
restaurant. After the good things pro
vided had been disposed of toasts were
responded to as follows: "The Inter

WARS AND STRIKES.
TV T EWSPAPER readers follow the war in Asia by the meager
\l reports which come from the respective headquarters of the
* contending armies. They read of the movements on the
Shahke Kiver. below Mukden. Kuroki crowds Kuropatkin, and is
crowded in turn. Xogi captures 203-Metre Hill and dominates Port
Arthur. There are bombarding all day and bayonet fights at night,
varied by sword-to-sword encounters.- All of this is interesting
and more or less stirring, as it tells of the fluctuating fortunes ot^
On the same page that carries this news of the distant conflict
is the daily report of another war nearer at hand, and under ex
planatory headlines we have, in dispatches from Duquoin, Illinois,
something like this: "Another attack was made on Zeigler last night.
Firing began at the pumping station two miles north and spread
quickly to the mining town, which is under siege and responded
with its machine guns. Doth parties conceal the number of casual
ties."' This is repeated every day. with such variations as are made
necessary by changes in the tactics of the investing forces and in
the plans of the besieged. The blockade is not complete, we are
told, because the besieging force has not yet been able to completely
inclose the town, and the besieged are able to secure provisions,
water, ammunition and reinforcements.
This is the first attempt to reduce an American town by siege
since the Civil War. The only protracted siege in that struggle
was at Yieksburg. and the daily accounts of that event read very
much* like those of the siege of' Zeigler. But what is it all about?
Zeigler is a coal mining town, and the owner of the property resists
the unionizing of the mines. Having a force of workmen willing to
work the mines and willing to work with union or non-union miners
on equal conditions, the owner desires to mine, ship and sell the
coal produced on his property. This desire of the owner and
disposition of his- employes are resented and resisted by strikers
and the union miners of the district. These forces nearly surround
the town, in entrenched camps, well supplied with arms and
ammunition, and are carrying on a regular siege, with all the inci
dents of public war.
The investing forces make sallies and capture stores on the way
to the fortress, and every day there is shooting from the rifle pits
and trenches, and every night there is a general assault. The
besiegers have not yet brought artillery into action, but there is
no reason why they should not use it, as well as the small arms
they have. Their siege is supported by assessment levied on miners
far and near, a regular war tax. such as Japan and Russia exact
from their people. They have not yet resorted to the sale of bonds,
like other belligerents, but this may come if the resistance is as
stubborn as that of Port Arthur. The commander of the forces
inside declares his ability to hold out and make successful his policy
of utilizing his own property in his own way, and the general of
the investing army announces his capacity to maintain the siege
indefinitely. This is not a public war. The State of Illin6is is at
peace with all the world, yet war is being waged on its soil to
strike down property rights and to destroy the right of private
contract.
The owner of the Zeigler mine has the legal right to work
his own property in his own way, if he can find employes ready
to accept his terms. This he has done, but the armed force which
nearly surrounds him refuses to permit him to employ whom he
pleases, and to his employes the right to work for whom and on
what terms they please. This is the fundamental issue that is being
brought out in a prolonged action at arms. It is an attempt by
force and slaughter to compel employer and employes to submit to
ihe arbitrary will of men who are third parties and have no legal
relation to the matter at all. Submission of one man to the arbitrary
will of another is a surrender of his civil liberty.
What is the State of Illinois doing in the premises? The bill
of rights in its constitution guarantees civil liberty to all its people.
Governor Yates has taken an oath to enforce the constitution and
the law. If the defenders of Zeigler are compelled to surrender to
a superior force they surrender civil liberty, not only for them
selves, but for all the people of Illinois. If an armed and illegal
force can compel such surrender at one place and not be punished
for its act, the same may be done at all places in the State. If the
law is powerless at Zeigler, it will be so from Chicago to Rock
Island, from Galena to Cairo.
Such demonstrations as this'at Zeigler are insurrections against
the civil state. Succeeding in one place and enjoying immunity,
they may spread to many places and then insurrection develops
into revolution. Under a republican form of government the rights
denied at^Zeigler are fundamental. When and where they are suc
cessfully denied, republican government no longer exists. The
issues between the owner and the Miners' Union at Zeigler dis
appear in the presence of the greater issue of civil liberty. Are the
besiegers at Zeigler above the law and are the besieged below it?
INTERSTATE RAILWAY RATES.
REPORTS from Washington indicate a conflict between the
President and the Senate as to the legislation upon the sub
ject of interstate railway rates which was foreshadowed in
the Presidential message. The Senate is said to have determined
that nothing shall be done until next Congress, while the Presi
dent desires immediate Congressional action in the matter.
It is hard to say why there should be any delay in an act of
justice such as this. The evils which would be rectified by the
action which the President has outlined are real and pressing evils,
and they are inflicting an injury upon the trade of California and
upon that of other States from which recovery will in any case
be sufficiently slow. The President's suggestioYis were moderate
in the extreme. He did not propose to clothe the Interstate Com
mission with arbitrary powers to fix railway rates, but only to de
cide, subject to judicial review, what shall be a r-asonable rate in
such cases where the given rate has been challenged. He believes
that this would constitute the most important legislative act now
needed so far as regards the regulation of corporations, and in
this belief he has the hearty concurrence of the commercial sections
This is, of course, only a part of the larger question, which
was generously outlined in the Presidential message and epitomised
by the declaration that "we must strive to keep the highways of
commerce open to all on equal terms." To do this rebates must
be stopped and the law which was intended to prevent railway dis
crimination in interstate and foreign commerce must be enforced.
The satisfaction with which the Presidential assurances were
received will be measurably tempered if it transpires that the Seri
ate is resolved upon a postponement. The President showed a
great knowledge of the conditions, as well as a great sympathy for
the needs of interstate commerce, and his hands must be strength
ened for the speedy accomplishment of the. needed legislation. .
CALIFORNIA DEVELOPMENT.
THE meeting of California development organizations, which
was held at Sacramento on June 18, 1903, has already borne
good and substantial fruit. The object of that meeting was
to promote the closer co-operation of the various development
efforts now active throughout the State. To that end it was
then decided to form a promotion committee for each county, such
committees to form part of a counties committee of the Central
California promotion committee. It was further determined that
the counties committee hold meetings semirannually and at such
other times as. may be deemed advisable.
As a result of this admirable arrangement it is now announced
that the second semi-annual meeting of officers and representa
tives of all development organizations, as well-as Chambers'of Com-
THE SAN ,FRANCISCO CALL; SUNDAY. DECEMBER 11, 1904.
A SON OF WEALTH
T first It was merely the rumor of
a rumor, then it became an au
|vj| thenticated report and last the
f^\ town â or at least that part of It
i which considered itself indu
v bitably "upper crust"â thrilled
with the knowledge that Hemingway
Trent was to spend a month with his
aunt, Mrs. Ordway.
Set down in black and white, this
fact appears insignificant, but just
think a moment and reseat the name
over and over to yourself â "Trent,
Trent," and you will doubtless begin to
thrill, for the name of Trent is known
wherever pickles are eaten or money
is spent.
It is only fair to the present Trents
to explain that it is a far cry from the
original pickle â or rather from the little
patch of ground on the edge of a young
cityâ where that first pickle â thai
Aladdin's lamp of a pickle â grew, to
the present representatives of the fam
ily.
Hemingway, the future head of the
Trent family, aged 26 years, was com
ing to Carriston for a visit. A blaze of
interest sprang up in anxious mother
hearts at first rumor of this fact, and
though they guarded eye and lip, some
sparks flew and little additional fires
sprang u:> in the hearts of marriage
able daughters. Finally the air became
surcharged. Adamantine father-hearts
gave signs of emotion â a restlessness, a
critical, lingering survey of daughterly
charms. Several rush orders for gowns
of more than ordinary beauty were sent
scurrying across the continent. And It
was significant that this finery to come
was never mentioned â not even be
tween the best of friends. i
Amid all the Intense, subdued flurry
' of preparation there was one family
: that remained serene. Mr. and Mrs.
j Barry of Barrydene went their elegant,
â  languid way, undistracted and un
: moved, though they, too, had a mar
i rlageable daughter. The way of the
I Barrys had long since ceased to be af-
I fluent. If the Hemingways, for whom
j Trent was named, had left a ram
; shackle shanty far behind them, the
1 Barrys, on the other hand, had come
, from a rare old colonial mansion that
i overlooked the River Severn. The only
difference between them was that they
had started at different ends of the
. chain.
Still, Brenda Barry, only child and
chief depository of the practical sense
of the house of that name, was usually
filled with a tingling resentment when
she heard of the enormous fortunes
of the "new" people. Being a woman,
she could not fail to feel the subtle
tenseness In the social atmosphere and
for the same reason she instinctively
divined its cause. And to say that she
was scornful but faintly expresses It.
There was nothing about the good
looking, athletic young fellow whom
she met a week later to justify that
scorn. He was the usual thine â a very
much washed, immaculately dressed
young man of the day, with a desire to
please which was so apparent that
Brenda had to goad herself into rempm
bering how frightfully new and dis
gustingly rich he was.
This attitude on the part of one
whose head might well have been
turned by the flattery and attention
he was receiving on all sides mollified
her somewhat. Then, by chance, she
happened to encounter a rather vindic
tive glance from Helen Carrlncton's
violet eyes â Helen was wearing an ex
quisitely simple gown that had not
seen the light before â and suddenly her
own plan of action- was clearly mapped
out In her mind.
"Too much soothing syrup," she re
flected ironically. "What he needs Is
a tonic." This mental comment of hers
may have had something to do with
the delightful sense Of refreshment
young Trent felt In her presence. She
merce in California, will be held in Pasadena on December 17. It
seems that there are in California no less than 146 of such organi
zations and that they spend a very considerable sum of money
every year in furtherance of their laudable objects. To a certain
extent these objects are local, but to a much greater extent they
are general, and the advantages that must accrue from unification,
co-operation and centralization are many and obvious.
A movement such, as this is the outcome of a wholesome and
patriotic enthusiasm for California, and certainly no State in the
Union has better justification for the publicity which is sought.
There is no part of the world that can offer % better investments nor
happier homes, and the extent to which the committee can make
this known is one of the measures of their service. The whole
community participates in the substantial benefits, resulting from
these efforts, and the whole community should show its appreciation.
At the forthcoming Pasadena meeting the special topic for
consideration will be "Californian Publicity," and it will, of course,
be treated by practical men in a practical way. Publicity implies
population, trade and . prosperity ; it- means an ever larger place
for California in the markets of the world.
How large that place may be is necessarily a matter for con
jecture, but, the promotion committees will doubtless make it a
matter of experiment. Wherever Californian produce has made its
appearance it has been received with the welcome which its excel
lence insures, but the. world, is a big place, and much earnest and
unified work must be done along the precise lines which the com
mittees are following. California ought to have its representatives
not only throughout the East, but also throughout Europe, in order
that s every. opening market may be. promptly filled, and in order that
Californian produce may become the recognized standard of excel
lence. , : 'V'>v/v-i.: u.f:
PORT ARTHUR AND THE BALTIC FLEET.
THE latest Japanese successes at Port Arthur have immeasur
ably increased the difficulties which await the Russian Baltic
fleet. Port Arthur can now give them no better welcome
than the destructive impact of Japanese shells, which can search
out well nigh every corner of the harbor and make it entirely
impossible as a refuge. The Russian authorities, doubtles.f, have
their plans, which they naturally do not divulge,' but it is hard to
understand what those plans can be. The ships "which have been
lying in Port Arthur harbor are now practically destroyed. The
Baltic fleet will arrive under all the disadvantages inseparable from
a long voyage, while Admiral Togo has had abundant leisure to
refit, and to perfect his plans for a vigorous attack. The behavior
of the Russian ships since their voyage began, on the Dogger Bank
and elsewhere, gives some color to the suggestion that the Russian
authorities have no plans except to desperately maintain an appear
ance of doing something.
THE CANTEEN SYSTEM IN THE ARMY.
1T seems probable that the. canteen system will be re-established
â¢ in the United States army,, and it is even stated that those
who were most instrumental in its abolition are now anxious
for its reinstatement. After all, there appears to be no particular
reason to assume that a soldier is lacking in the same intelligent
self-control\that characterizes other citizens who do not happen
to be soldiers. The abolition of the canteen appears to have given
rise to other and far greater evils, as must always be the case
where a mistaken morality is allowed to interfere with the right
of every human being, within certain obvious limits, to recognize
the difference between good and evil and to; choose between them.
There can be no virtue without free : will.

asked him none of the usual questions
with which the others , had pestered
him until he wondered impatiently if
they had nothing to think of but him.
Indeed, she didn't seem to be very clear
as to his identity, so that he felt com
pelled to refer rather, diffidently to the
fact that he was on a visit to his aunt,
Mrs. Ordway. Even then her face was
impassive.
"Rather a stunning girlâ that Miss
Barry," he remarked to his aunt the
next day on their drive as she pointed
Barrydene to him, while he noted with
interest its picturesque decay. The
, stucco house was a beautiful, soft gray,
and what had once been a garden after
the Italian manner was now overcrown
and neglected, ;yet full of wistful
beauty. Near a corner of the house he
caught the gleam of a light gown and
energetically tried by means of hyp
notic suggestion to cause his aunt. to
stop, but she sat placidly beside him,
utterly unaware that the castle of her
mind was being assaulted.
Trent reasoned that if you pass a

person's house often enough you are
pretty sure to meet that person. On
the third successive morning that he
passed Barrydene she came through
the gate In the neglected hedge just
as his horse Jogged slowly by.
She wore a short pink gown, with
sleeves turned back and collar turned
In, and In her hand she carried what
appeared to be a wet napkin. She
greeted him with a negligent nod. put
ting him still further at ease by her
inquiry.
"Have you â I don't suppose you
have â but have you seen a small doe:
that looked as if he were sneaking
away from home?"
Trent was off his horse In a mo
ment, while he assured her that thouch
he had encountered no such animal,
he was sure that he could find it should
she command. She put away his offer.
"Oh, he'll come back! Only, he knows
it's wrongâ and I like to be obeyed."
"I'd obey In a jiffyâ If you'd tell me
to come in," Trent ventured boldly.
Miss Barry was all demureness for
a moment, then a wicked gleam danced
into her eyes.
"Come â pray do." she Invited sweetly,
and a moment later he had tied his
horse and was walking beside her up
the graveled path, where the grass grew
unrebuked. Everywhere there was dis
order, byt it was of the pictorial sort,
that has an attraction all its own. To
Hemingway Trent, accustomed to
grounds that were bathed and shaved
almost as regularly a3 their masters,
it was oddly charming. His companion,
however, noticing his musing, lingering

"Pities us, I suppose, because we
haven't a head gardener and two or
three assistants," she thought to her
self resentfully. Thereupon she decided
to shock his sensibilities still more.
"It's rather informal, I know," she
said glibly, "but I'm going right on
with my work," and she led the way
around to the rear of the house. "You
see, I've just been doing a few of the
small fine pieces myself, the Chinaman
brings them back streaked in so many
shades of pink and blue/'
She looked at him furtively, but It
was evident he was thoroughly mysti
fied. She was obliged to be more ex
plicit. v
"Washing, you know," she elaborated,
pointing to an Indian basket heaped
with linen that stood on the grass.
"Now Just make yourself comfortable
and talk to me while I work," and slie
proceeded rather ostentatiously to
spread out some dainty handkerchiefs
and napkins on the adjoining rose
bushes, w,hile. her caller looked on In
shocked, speechless amazement.
"Oh, I say! You oughtn't to do this,
you know. It's ridiculous; It's an out
rage. Get a Chinaman who'll do the
right thing. There must be one some
where."
Miss Harry became sweetly pensive.
Resignment spoke from every line of
her face.
"There are some," she admitted, "but
they charge, oh, fearfully!" Then, wilh
hands locked behind' her she stood back
and regarded the bushes wheYe all the
sweet 'rose faces were now hidden from
the sun. with a virtuous enthusiasm.
"That saves papa as much as a dollar,"
she said proudly, "and every little
helps."
Trent murmured something, he did
not precisely know what, so busy he
whs trying to think what it must be
like, the financial condition that made
the saving of a dollar so great a thing.
Brenda covertly watched him with,
fiendish delight which was. It Is true,
modified when she discovered that his
surprise was changing Into a sort of
awed admiration
Still she managed to convey to him
before he took his dazed departure that
she usually spent the early morning
hours gardeningi working in another
pathetic reference their need of
economy.
Promptly the next morning Trent,
clad in the most disreputable clothes
he could procure, might have been seen
hanging about the Barrydene hedges.
When the daughter of the house finally
made her appearance â it was not so
early though as he had been led to
believ.e â he walked in boldly announc
ing with the simplicity of the early
Trentsâ the market garden onesâ that
he'd come to help. Miss Barry's face
turned a riotous red, and she tried to
dissuade him, but for an hour' or more
he digged and delved at her side right
sturdily. Once begun, there was no
stopping him, and Carrlston watched
the disgraceful affair aghast. When
later on the -ardening led to the usual
result, Brenda looked him straight in
the eve.
"I fancy that I have angled for you
just as much as the others," she said
breathlessly. But Hemingway Trent
only laughed.

STOP DEER KILLING
FOR SEVERAL YEARS,
SAYS CORRESPONDENT
Editor The Call: In The Call of No
vember 30 I notice a lengthy article re
garding killing and selling of game;
also a proposition to limit the killing of
deer to two In one season. The fact of
the matter Is, if it is the object for deer
to Increase, a law must be passed to stop
the killing altogether for a few years.
As It is, as long as hunters are allowed
to hunt deer they will kill all they can
and pay but small regard to whether
they are does or bucks, and some of
them go so far as to shoot cattle in
mistake for deer, not using the neces
sary precaution. to know what they are
shooting at. This Is well known here,
and, as a consequence, cattlemen are In
favor of stopping the killing of deer and
thus save more cattle.
Little attention Is paid to the game
laws In the mountains, as some will
kill to use whenever they get the
chance. Two members of a sportsmen's
club killed quail out of season, and. as
an excuse, said they thought they had
a right to, being members of the club.

WHILE THE CITY EXPANDS
ITS EDUCATIONAL WANTS
SHOULD NOT BE NEGLECTED
Every rapidly growing city faces
grave municipal problems and to this
proposition the city of San Francisco
Is no exception. First of all municipal
wants demanding .attention are the
physical needs of a city. Its sanitary
needs of water and sewerage, its pro
tection from fire and from marauders
are essential to Its existence. Then
next In Importance, a cause dear to
every American, is the education of
the children and youth, and, in these
days It may be added, the education
of the masses 'of the people through
out a lifetime.
San Francisco now has a population
closely bordering on half a million.
The causes which have given it a sud
den impulse and have brought its re
cent strong growth are permanent
ones. Soon* there will be three-quar
ters of a million people here, and, not
long after, a million persons. This pro
phecy is deemed by many residents to
be wild and visionary, but It is certain
that the rest of the country does not
share In the belief of San Francisco's
moderate growth. It is elsewhere a
common expression that San Fran
cisco is sure to become one of the
great cities of the world.
This local pessimism is unfortunate
for the city's future welfare; it pre
cludes sound judgment for the needs
of the hereafter. It is wholly unlike
the dominant spirit of Chicago. In
that city every resident has believed
in Its great future and has acted ac
cordingly from the days of its village
life to the present hour, when it is the
home of 2,000,000 people. It is not
true, however, that the majority of
the citizens of San Francisco entertain
the belief that San Francisco will have
a slow growth.- The successful efforts
put forth for the bonding of the city
for modern Improvements and those
now under way for its artistic develop
ment forbid that opinion.
But the regrettable truth is that
while this vision of expansion has par
tially dawned upon San Francisco, ef
forts for the development and advance
of the public school system of the
city are paralyzed. Charter amend
ments are discussed and action on
them Is indefinitely postponed. The
new school buildings will be erected at
an uncertain date. It is even pro
posed that many of them shall be
frame structures, when the fact is that
hardly any city of 10,000 throughout
the whole country will consent to the
use of any material but brick or stone.
It is next to impossible to secure any
marked increase of appropriations for
the schools. The city authorities con
tent themselves with annually grant
ing $350,000, which is added to the
State's allotment of $1, 010,000, mak
ing a total expenditure for the year
of $1,360,000. '
Notwithstanding all handicaps, the
Board of Education and the force of
superintendents are doing their utmost
to direct the teachers along the best
lines of educational progress and are
successfulâ to a certain extent. The
work done by the San Francisco
schools ranks well with that of many
Eastern cities. But, it must be re
membered, this work is performed
largely on the old lines of a dozen
years or more ago. The educational
world has been advancing in that pe
riod in ideas and practice to a wonder
ful degree.
Yfct San Francisco practically stands
still. The educational leaders who
have recently returned from visits
among the schools of the East tell but
one story, and that is that San Fran
cisco is far behind the times.
New York, Chicago, Cleveland and
many other cities have grasped the
idea that school education should be
a real preparation for life work. Com
mencement is ' made by v a wide adop
tion of the kindergarten. The psycho
logical truth that play Is a powerful
element in mental, as well as physical,
development is* adopted through the
ample school playgrounds, or by the
use of the platformed roofs.
Gymnasiums and manual training
form part of the equipment and courses
of even the elementary schools. School
gardens prove to be no less valuable to
child nature in the United States than
in France, where it is said that no

school Is allowed to be unprovided with
a garden spot. In the high schools of
these progressive Eastern cities thor
ough manual training in advanced
work and complete commercial study
fit the boy and girl to step into their
chosen pursuits thoroughly prepared.
Dr. Maxwell, superintendent of the
New York schools, has lately said in
an address at Cooper Union: "Play
Is Imperative In the school as affording
relaxation for the pupil. Gymnastics
strengthen the body and help to build
up a healthy mind. Athletics Is a sys
tematized form of play and strengthen*
the courage, self-control and loyalty
to one's fellows through working to
gether to one end. Manual training
cultivates the mental and moral habit
of accurateness and truthfulness. "With
out these four forms no school is doing
Its perfect work."
Considering the subject of Industrial
education a Httle more In detail, look
at the outlays In New York for this
purpose. That city Is now constructing
two manual training schools each of
which will cost nearly $1,000,000 and
$100,000 more for the machinery. TherÂ»
will be In the molding rooms a cupola
of one ton capacity for melting Iron
and also a brass furnace. In the forea
room will be found a 230-pound steam
hammer, besides numerous steam en
gines and electric motors. Look out
on East River and see a vessel an
chored there which contains a nautical
school for the boys who are ambitious
to be sailors. Bathrooms are provided
In the school buildings of the over
crowded tenement districts. Nearly
5000 free lectures were given to adults
last year In 143 lecture centers. The
teachers, too, are not forgotten by an
appreciative municipality. Any teacher,
or supervisor, who has given thirty-flvÂ»
years' service, twenty of which havÂ»
been spent In the city schools, may be
retired on half pay when disabled, o^
on reaching the age of sixty-five. The
total expenditures for New York's pub
lic schools for 1904 will be over $21,
000.000.
If it be true that San Francisco Is,
educationally considered, In a stagnant
condition, it is.not difficult to ascertain
the cause. It is wholly and entirely for
the reason that public sentiment has
not been awakened to the needs of edu
cational Improvement. The busy com
mercial or professional man, unaware
of the tremendous advance and high
educational standards of this period.
Is not conscious that the modern rich
developements of school life should be
realized, at least to some extent, by hla
own boys and girls. That thev will
hereafter be handicapped for want or
the most thorough training this ag~
can give does not enter his thought*.
He pays his taxes, hears that his chil
dren are "doing well" In school and is
content.
There is one way, and one only,
that is now visible by which the pub
lic mind may be awakened to a Just
sense of local educational wants. In
this city is a civic body that ia large,
thoroughly organized, powerful. ThÂ«
object of Its existence is to care for
the public good. The value of its
previous efforts for the welfare of th>Â»
city Is beyond estimate. It makes no
mistakes. Its name Is the Merchants'
Association. If this association with
its wealth of membership, resources
and character will take up this meas
ure In Its own thorough-going, broad
gauged manner of transacting busi
ness there will be no failure. The re
ports of the committees of the asso
ciation, co-operating with the school
authorities in exhaustive local and
Eastern investigations, will carry
weight with ever^ citizen of San Fran
cisco and their recommendations are
morally certain of adoption. The
value of such a movement in behalf of
the public schools of San Francisco
cannot be computed. To say the least,
the results will be on a par with the
successful labors of the asosclation In
promoting the bond Issue of 513.000.
000. Virtually such a work carried to
completion amounts to relaying, the
educational foundations of this city.

Ultimately it will be found on ex
amination that the rule of Right re
solves itself into the ruJe of Benevo
lence, while the ultimate analysis of
all forms of . Wrong will be found to
be pure, undiluted Selfishness.
The greatest moral teacher the I
world has ever seen has admirably
epitomized the law of Right for the I
guidance of moral beings: "Thou
shalt love the Lord thy Gci with all
thy heart and soul and mind and
strength, ant', thy neighbor as thy-
self." There we have in a nutshell
the rule of Right, the great 'moral
law of Benevolence.
Wrong, on the other hand, may
consist either of wrong actions, or of
right actions with a wrong motive. Ul
timately the leaven of selfishness may
be detected in both. Even .the love
of home, of family, or of country,
may become pure and undiluted self
ishness, or, at best, a mere animal in
stinct. I love them because they are
mine. In other words, I love myself.
The love of benevolence wills . their
highest good, and soars higher than
this realm of selfishness, and makes
the necessary sacrifice that may be
required to obtain the object, and
subordinates their welfare to the
higher good, which conscience, rea
son or revelation may present.
Benevolence must not be confound
ed with mere emotional sentiment.
Benevoience is the deliberate choice
of a right object in life with a cor
responding set of right actions in pur
suance of that objecr, this being the"
best and indeed only way to secure
the enjoyment of those emotions
which constitute one of its sweetest
rewards.
To use a simple illustration, Wrong
stands with its back to the sun, its
face turned toward the shadow of
Self. Sometimes that shadow takes
the form of Wealth, sometimes of

lesser for the greater good, the paltry

The genius realizes that his brains

STORM BATTERED AID IN DISTRESS, COQUELLE RETURNS
Gales Keep Little Vessel! From Reachflimg Bamdoan
The schooner Coquelle. Captain
Springer, which left here October 22 for
BacdoaJ returned from tea yesterday in
distress. *oljfi had been unable to reach
ibnl Oregon |wrt and in the effort to
uvvicoir.e the opposition of repeated
lilies sustained considerable damage.
But for the fact, however, that food
and provisions guve out, Captain
Bpringer would not have abandoned the
attempt to reach his port of destina
tion.
The Coquelle left here October 22 and
November 1 was off liandon. South
easter- arm sc-uthwesters in bewilder
ing BUcccEtion drove her to sea and
kept driving her until a.n observation
showed that she was in latitude 46.25
north. She was spoken December 1 off
Sluslaw by tho steamer Whittier and
StrppUed with provisions.
More gales followed, but between
them ehe managed to get another look
at Dandun, only to be wnisked off to
sea as-in." When the food supplied by
the Whittier gave out and the water
supply Mil low. Captain Springer de
cided thai home was the fcest piace lor
the Co.iuelle. She appeared off the
port early yesterday morning and late
in the afternoon the tug Alert brought
her into the harbor.
Her rigging on the port side and her
sprlsfi stay were curried away and her
bowsprit started. A number of sails
were torn to ribbons.
The Coquelle has been a source of
great anxiety since she left here Octo
ber 22 and her owners were badly wor
ried about her when the steamer Whit
tier arrived here and reported having
spoken the schooner at sea and sup
plied her with provisions. The Whit
tler reported the schooner somewhat
the worse for wear, l'art of her rig
ging had been carried away and she
had suffered generally in the gales
which had Interfered with her progress
toward the Oregon pcrrt.
The next heard of the Coquelle she
was off Uandon with her ilag at half
mast. JSelore she could make port she
disappeared in the smother of another
gale and when- the weather cleared was
nut in sight.
The conditions under which she van
ished gave added cause for anxiety and
hope for the little windjammer was dy
ing when John Hyslop, tTie far-sighted
observer for the Merchants' Exchange,
reported her off this port yesterday,
headed for home.

M. F. Plant Ends Lonjr Voyage.
The little steamer M. F. Plant. Cap
tain Nc-lson, arrived here yesterday,
" f-ixty-three days from Philadelphia. She
eras boagbt recently in the East by the
Oregon Coal and Navigation Company
and will be engaged in carrying coal
froxa Coos Bay to this port. The Plant
came by way of the Straits of Magel
lan, where she anchored from Novem
ber 12 until November 13. She en
countered some heavy weather, but
managed to keep go:nr all the time and
made a fair passage tor a vessel erf her
class.
r J he crew of the steamer brought to
port a long list of grievances and sev
eral samples of the drinking water
which vas served to them at sea. The
sample exhibited by 'one old salt con
tained about 40 per cent of solid matter
and slime. Samples and grievances
v,jll be unfolded to-morrow before the
United States Shipping Commissioner.
Tli? men complain of the poor living
accommodation furnished them. The
deck above the forecastle, they say,
leaks and when the steamer's nose
rooted into a head sea the watch below
received a liberal shower bath. '"The
Plant's forecastle in a head sea is like
a basket under a hose" was the graphic
description furnished by one of the
prievanee-ladened mariners.
The Plant, which is a vessel of 941 net
tens." was launched twenty-five years
â "â go as the Cocoa. The baptismal name
was soon pointed out. however, and the
steamer was known among ships as the
Argonauta. Her name was changed
ajrain to Cuba and once more to the
prosaic cognomen under which Ehe is
â  now registered.

The Cotton Market.
The New York wlr*s of E
Oo. yesterday sa'.d:
F. Rutton A
"On the week closing cables from Liver
pool cur market opened weak at seven to
twelve point* decline, with the trading quite
active. People who sold yesterday on the rise
bought their cotton back at the opening, and
â¢.:.. market rallied some few points. As wÂ«
have said it locks &s though it would be a
, <-. . scalping market for the next two weeks.
We would advise taking quick profits on either
Fide.
Tbe local trade on the whole Is getting very
besriPh on the belief that the Wall street in
terests have covered up their short interest and
that the market is technically in a weak po
sition; but on even a Fpeculauve baÂ£is we oe
iievp that the trade is getting too bearish.
Hjwts in the South are etlU above a parity
â w ith futures in our market, fcnd continue in
fair demand. The bears claim that the hold
ing jjl cotton In the South by the farmers is
a Â»f-ak point, on the theory that banks will
hav* to call M:~.r loans tr.d If that bo the case
thf farmers uill then be forced to offer their
actual octton for sale, as very lew will refund
money on cotton unsold.
The course of the market is uncertain, as
it Ipcks as though a contest Is forming be
twfen the spinners and bear speculators and
sj>ot dealers an cne !Â»Â«"* and the planters and
fartories on the other. To dictate the price
for the marketing of the rest of the crop, with
the bull account which exists here and at New
Orifans. and Liverpool having been pretty
well eliminated on the break following the
publication of the Government report, shows
that tiir heaviest pressure from new on will
c-vme lar:r<-ly from frefh export selling, and '
that it" bears will oversell themselves at times
in their anxiety to further depress prices, and
tt'.&t we shall stÂ« frequent rallies cuch as we
have had the last week.
"Hester estimates the world's visible cotton
Rpxdy at 4.317.314 bales, against 3,e38,19â¬
inn year."

Wheat and Other Grains.
WHEAT â The foreign markets were not ma
terially changed. Chicago -was several frac
tions lower. . :
The Agricultural Department reports that
the newly seeded area of winter wheat is
about 31,155,000 acres, a decrease of 1.6 per
cent from the area sown In the fall of 1903.
The condition of winter wheat December I
was S2.9, as compared with 86.6 in 1003, 99.7
In 1902 and a ten year average of 92.1. .
The Chicago wires of E. F. Button & Co.
said: "Wheat has had a fair recovery from
the low prices of the week, and this, to our
mind, reflects a very strong speculative posi
tion. Personally, we ew nothing In our do
mestic situation to make for higher prices.
Receipts exceed consumption. There is no ex
port demand, and we advised this. The flour
trade is flat. While the Argentine situation
at the moment promises favorable results, the
crop in that country is still far from being out
of danger and will continue to rule ava fea
ture for eome Httle time yet. We doubt very
much if money can bo made at this time, in
celling wheat short, except on extremely sharp
bulges."
In the San Francisco market the cash grain
was dull and â  unchanged, but futures were
strong, notwithstanding the Chicago decline,
en some buying orders and dry weather.
But, according to a statement by the broker
age firm of Yates & Wright, the Sacramento
and San Joaquin valleys are not especially in
need of rain, as the soil is In fine condition
and the condition of the crop excellent. This
Information cornea from correspondents in
those regions.

Butter, Cheese and Eggs.
â  Butter -closed the week very firm, with fine

Deciduous and Citrus Fruits.
The market was fairly active on local ac
count during the early. trade, as retailers were
purchasing., for ' two days' requirements,
but Jiuyers as â¢ a " rule were operat
ing cau^lfliisly and - not taking any
more than necessary for immediate wants.
The top quotation of $2 per box was
still being asked and obtained In a small way
for favored brands of Navel Oranges from cer
tain districts, but equally fancy ' fruit â¢ from
other sections was offered . freely at â $ I 75,
which was considered an extreme price for
the general rum of offerings. Other Citrus
fruits were quiet and the top quotation for
Lemons was shaded. The Apple market.- Is
gradually ' working into better shape. Cheap
and medium , priced goods ar^i pretty well
cleaned . up and the upper grades . are com
mencing to move more freely. â  Receipts have
shown a marked falling . off lately, the low
prices and demoralized condition of the market
having: checked the movement from outside
points. Receipts of Pears, ' Persimmons and
Grapes are becoming lighter every day* and
these descriptions cut but little figure In the
market. The same may be Bald of Strawber
ries, which have been' selling at irregular
prices lately. Two chests of strictly fancy
Longworths were received yesterday, one of
which was peddled out at $15 and the other at

THE SAN^ ?FRANGISGO CALL, SUNDAY, DECEMBER' 11; 1904:
PRODUCE MEN
WIN AND LOSE
Judge Sloss BeUeYes Com
bination Is Not in Viola
tion of Woodward Law
INJUNCTION IS DENIED
Court Holds It Cannot Go
Into â  Evidence on Which
the Permits Were Revoked
i Judge Sloss yesterday overruled the
demurrer of the Harbor Commissioners
to the complaint of. four, produce com
mission firms whose permits had been
revoked by the board, but he dis
charged the order- to show cause why
the board should not be enjoined from
interfering with the dealers' business on
the wharves. The harbor officials get
ten days in which to answer the com
plaint.
The litigation arose over the action
of the Harbpr Board in revoking the
permits of Schultz, Hanson & Co.. G. B.
Olcese Company, Jonas, Erlanger, Da
vis Company and Webster & Dunbar.
The firms were charged with violating
the Woodward act and a rule of the
board providing that the dealers, on
demand, should sell potatoes in ten
sack lots and onions In five-sack lots.
The dealers entered into an agreement
in writing to buy and sell in not less
than fifty-sack lots of potatoes and
twenty-flve-sack lots of onions. â¢
Judge Sloss held that the agreement
between the dealers provided that
smaller lots might be sold at propor
tionately higher prices and therefore it
only fixed a minimum lot to which
wholesale prices would apply and was
not in violation of the Woodward law.
It would be an unreasonable construc
tion of the law, he said, tc? hold that it
imposes on dealers who hold permits
to trade on the wharves a duty to sell
at retail as low "as they sell at whole
sale. On the face of the complaint, said
the court, the charge against the deal
ers did not constitute a violation of the
terms of the permit and furnished no
Justification for revocation of the per
mits.
In dealing with the question of the
injunction, Judge Sloss found that
there were other consideraticms. The
affidavit of John M. Foy, secretary of
the board, set forth that the dealers
had been accused of entering into a
conspiracy and the accusation did not
refer to the agreement which the plain
tiffs offered in court, relating to lots
and prices. The accusation was only
that the dealers had agreed not to buy
from or sell to certain parties in less
than fifty and twenty-five sack lots.
This charge was heard by the board
and determined adversely to the deal
ers and their permits were revoked. In
the absence of any claim that the board
had acted fraudulently, capriciously or
arbitrarily, the court would not con
sider the evidence before the board on
that hearing. The permits wjere re
voked on the charge that the Wood
ward act had been violated and there
was no ground for an injunction.
TWO MOKE SUITS AGAINST
GET-RICH-QUICK CONCERNS
Hobson Charges Companies With
Fraud and Their Directors With
Misapplying: the Funds.
H.' P. Hobson and a number of hold
ers of get-rich-quick contracts yester
day presented another package of liti
gation to three concerns operating in
this city. ,The suits filed are like the
many others in which Hobson has
been the leading plaintiff, alleging
fraudulent business, misapplication of
funds received and attempting to
transfer assets. In each case a re
ceiver is asked for, an injunction to
prevent the removal of the books and
assets and the return of the money
paid by the contract purchasers.
One of the actions is against W. C.
Wilson, A. Marcus, C. W. Mottwiler
and the Pacific Coast Mercantile Com
pany and the Producers' Mercantile
Company, which, it is said, was or
ganized to take over the assets of the
first concern. It Is charged that more
than 800 "two-for-one" contracts have
been sold, upon which more: than
$2i>,000 has been paid, and of this sum
it is alleged the members of the com
pany have appropriated to their -own
use more than $21,000. The second
suit, by Hobson and C. K Goessell,
holders of assigned contracts, is
against the Metropolitan Mercantile
Company, Charles Leonhardt Jr.,
Charles S. Jacobs, Ray N. ; Knight,
Charles P. Haag and Josephine Rosen
thai. This concern is said to have sold
more than 1000 contracts and re
ceived $25,000, of which $15,000, has
been misapplied under the guise of
"expense."
TAKE STEPS TO UPBUILD
HEALTH LABORATORY WORK
Officials and â  University Professors
Discuss Methods to Achieve More
Advanced Results."
A conference was held yesterday, in
the Health Office on the subject of
upbuilding the , laboratories of the

ent Professor Stillman of , . Stanford
University and Professors Rising and
Ward of the University of California,
with Dr. J. W. Ward, president of the
Board of Health; Drs. Joseph F. Po
hfcim, W. A. Harvey and J. V. Hughes,'
members of the board; . Health Officer
D. F. Ragan, Bacteriologist F. A. Can
ney and Superintendent A.; C. Bothe of
the Pude Food Department. .
The discussion developed ideas that
the- present board intends putting, into
execution within the next few. months.
Another conference will , be ; held < and
in' the meantime Dr. Ward has issued
orders for more advanced'. work-in the
laboratories. A- lack of funds prevents:
better work being done, but it is hoped
that next year.-the; Supervisors' will
make a> larger appropriation.' - 1 â  *

Vast Wealth Won Through Her

Minds.
Special Dispatch to The CalL *
NEW YORK, Dec 10.â As a result of investigations carried on through a
large corps of correspondents throughout the United States, The Call is en
abled to present a connected history of the life of Mrs. Cassie L. .Chadwick.
To give In detail the story of her career would require volumes. The revela
tions made show her to have been one of the most remarkable women .the
world has ever known â one who numbered among her dupes some of the
foremost men of the nation and who since childhood has thrived upon du-*
plicity.
Daniel Bigley In the early '50*s lived on a small farm at Eastwood, province
of Ontario. He was poor and .had a large family-height children in all, and
the fifth was a daughter, born'in 1857 and christened Elizabeth, but knovrn to.
the other members of the family as "Betty."
"Betty" Bigley was never a particularly beautiful girl, and from early
years suffered slightly from deafness. She also spoke with a lisp. J She was
brightâ very bright. At school she was easily the leader in her classes, but
she was not popular. "Betty!' Bigley was - always strangeâ "peculiar," her
schoolmates declared. She had a positive mania for fine clothing, finer than
her father could give her, and for jewelry. She was not like other girls.
Once she went to a barber shop and had her long hair cropped short and
actually donned boys' clothing. She was always scheming, they said, to ob
tain something for nothing. She carried cards which set forth that she was
"Miss Bigley, heiress to 515,000."
STSAXGE POWER OVER MEX IS MANIFESTED. \
Even then her power over men was manifest. She obtained credit from
the merchants of Woodstock, about eight miles from her home, and one day
she obtained $250 on a note alleged to have been signed by_a' wealthy farmer
of Brantsford. When that note came due she took It up with another note,
purported to have been signed by Richard Kip of Woodstock^ When this note
came due there was no money to pay it. and 'the girl, in .-.November, 1879,
â was arrested for forgery. The defense was Insanity, and in' the trial many
witnesses were found to come forward with testimony as to her oddness and
eccentricity. She was acquitted.
She afterward repeated her swindling operations in Cleveland, Ohio, while ,
at the home of her married sister, who had taken her with the intention of
trying to effect a reformation. Jewels, gowns and dresses soon became hers..
When her personal credit -ran out she coolly took her sister's name and.be-.
gan to get more, money by giving chattel mortgages on the Campbell house
hold goods. Campbell was well to do, and she was enabled to run large ac
counts at dry goods stores. â  . .
In Cleveland in 18S0 she married Dr. W. Springstein, after .pretending
che was heiress to a. large estate In Cleveland. On the wedding night the
bridegroom had the disagreeable experience of seeing a regiment â  of
stallment *nen descend upon the place and take away not only the trous
seau of the bride and much of her furniture, but even, valuable wedding
presents that she was supposed to have received from wealthy relatives in
â¢ Ireland. That ended the Springstein romance, and the physician left her.-
Within a day the Campbell chattel mortgages became known, and the
sisters parted. Mrs. Springstein brought suit for separation against her
husband and lost it. He subsequently obtained a divorce.'
RICH BUSINESS MEN VICTIMIZED.
Mrs. Springstein left Cleveland soon after that and began to travel
about the country. Her power of fascination, it is said, increased. For
more than a year Lydia Clingan, Lylle Clingan or Lylie Bagley was heard
â¢ about all throughout the country as heiress to an estate abroad.
Mrs. Alire Bestado. clairvoyant, appeared in an expensive suite of of
fices of the Crocker block, Cleveland, in 1883. Her offices speedily became
a meeting place for many men. some of them well known in the business
world. Then began the usual campaign against money lenders and mer
chants. She lived expensively and her Jewels were the admiration of the
Another year saw a Mrs. Scott living in another section of the town,
but a clairvoyant and recognized as Mrs. Bestado. Mrs. Clingan soon aft>
erward took other apartments, and so did Mrs. Bagley, when creditors be
came importunate; and, last of all. was Mrs. C. L. Hoover.
"Mrs. Hoover" was the last name to be used fn Cleveland in the eight
ies, and to the sisters and family in Cleveland, as well as in Canada word
went that C. L. Hoover, an aged and wealthy man. had married her, only
to die soon afterward. There was a son. He is her only child .
Cleveland became too warm in 1S88, and that saw the disappearance of
Mrs. Hoover and the reappearance of Mme. de Vere. clairvoyant, in Toledo
Mme. de Vere's career stands out boldly and ends with a sentence to the
pentitentiary for forgery, but hardly a day passes now that some new inci
dent does not come out. Privately she was a clairvoyant, foreseeing, the fu
ture, but beyond that she was many things. Chiefly she was an heiress to a
great estate in England, tied up by litigation, and driven to make a"liveli
hood. A grocer named King believed In this and gave her money
Another man, whom the police could not tell about once gave her- $20 000 in
negotiable securities for the same purpose, and only because they accident
ally learned of this was the property recovered by the police. ' â  r
BLACKMAIL LEVIED UPON HER DUPES.
Mme. de Vere had several assistants In her clairvoyant parlorsâ youne
women. There are reports that some prominent Ohioans had preferred to pal
considerable money rather than have the fact of their visits become known to
their friends. There were at least two divorces in Cleveland In which Mme
' medTb^oad.^ having had a hand, and one-of .the-men faa^BiScV
It all culminated with the Lamp incident, for which Madame de Vere was
convicted of obtaining money under, false pretenses. . She was sentenced S
nine and a half years' imprisonment in the. Ohio penitentiary She h Â«d

.OTTAWA, Ont., Dec. 10.â Evidently.
President Roosevelt's Influence saved
an American recently condemned to
execution from, the gallows. A dispatch
from ! Sandwich, Ont., says: ; -
"It is stated that while the young col
ored man, Edward Slaughter, who mur
dered John* Rudden and, who has Just
been sent to the. big Government peni
tentiary at Kingston fpr life, was wait
ing execution here under his original
sentence his father, a" colored Baptist
minister ââ¢ at . Amherstburg, Ontario,
Canada, wrote a pathetic letter asking
President. Roosevelt to save the life,of
the" American, a mere boy, who had
been in .-Canada only- four years when
the crime was committed.
. "A few : hour3 before the reprieve ar
rived-the father received a letter from
the* President statins that United
States Consul General Foster at Ottawa
had been asked to confer with the Hon.
Charles Fitzpatrick, Canadian Minister
of Justice, for clemency In, behalf of
Slaughter as an American subject. To
add to â¢ this international aspect of the
case, Congressman Alfred Lucking of
Michigan also interested' himself and
appealed indirectly to Fitzpatrick."

for 'a definite extension -of the Gouli

pleted to-day, when E. T. â¢Jeffrey, pres
ident "of the . Denver and Rio GrandÂ©
Railway,' was elected vice president of
the Western Pacific Railway Company
at a meeting of the directors of that
road in this city. This action marked
the first public disclosure of the interest
of the Gould system in the Western Pa
cific. . * ! 'â :â -.
"After the meeting J. Barnett. presi
dent of the Western Pacific, said that
arrangements were being made to let

said that In a short time construction
forces would be placed in the field.
Barnett, David Walker, a Salt Lake

with the New York directors > of tha

sult of the conference was a decision to
begin construction. of the Western Pa

"After two years of careful prelim

from San Francisco. The route adopted
will cross the Sierra Nevada* through
Beckwith Pass on a line 1900 feet lower
than. that of the Central Pacltic and no
snowsheds will be required anywhere
along the route."
termed this mistaken leniency that the

"Crime is crime," said White, "and
it is our duty to make 'its prosecution
more speedy and, less Intricate. We
should stand together to . exterminate

What Sulphur Does
For the Human Body in Health and
The mention of salplrar irm recall to
rnÂ«ny of us the early days, when our
mothers and grandmothers^ fcave us our
daily doss of culphur and molasses

It vtbm the* universal eprlner and fall
"blood purlfler." tonic and cure-all, and,
mind you, this old-fashioned" remedy
was not -without merlti * "-. ' ,-/X.
The Idea was good.' but the- remedy
was crude and unpalatable, and. & large
quantity had to be taken to get any ef-
fect. : ' â - 7 .'"â -, f^y â ".
Xowadays we pet all the beneficial ef-
fects of culphur in a palatable,' concen-
trated form, bo that a single grain Is
far more effective than a tablespoonful
of the crude 6ulphur."
In recent years â¢research and experi-
ment have proven that the best sulphur
for medicinal use Is that obtained' from
Calcium (Calcium Sulphide) and sold
In drug stores under the name of Stu-.
art's Caldum_Wafers. They are small
chocolate-coated pellets and contain the
active medicinal principle of sulphur In
a highly concentrated, effective form.
Few people are aware of the value of
this form of sulphur in restoring and
maintaining bodily vigor and health;
sulphur acts directly on the liver and
excretory organs and purifies and en-
riches the blood by the prompt elimina-
tion of waste material.
Our grandmothers knew this when
they dosed us with sulphur and mo-
lasses every spring and fall, but the
crudity and impurity of ordinary flow-
ers of sulphur were often worse than
the disease, and cannot compare with â¢
the modern concentrated preparations
of sulphur, of which Stuart's Calcium
Wafers is undoubtedly the best and
most widely used.
They are the natural antidote for
liver and kidney troubles, and cure
constipation and purify the blood In a
way that often surprises patient and
physician alike.
Dr. R. M. Wllklns while experiment-
ing with sulphur remedies soon found
that the sulphur from Calcium was su-
perior to any other form. He says:
"For liver, kidney and blood troubles,
especially when resulting from consti-
pation or malaria, I have been sur-
prised at the results obtained f rÂ»m Stu-
art's Calcium Wafers. In patients suf-
fering from boils and pimples and even
deep-eeated carbuncles, I have. repeat-
edly seen them dry up and disappear in
four or five days, leaving the skin clear
and smooth. Although Stuart's Calcium
Wafers is a proprietary article, and
Bold by druggists, and for that reason
tabooed by many physicians, yet I :
know of nothing so safe and reliable
tor constipation, liver and kidney trou- j
bles, and especially In all forms of skin â 
disease, as this remedy." i
At any rate people who are tired of ;
Pills, cathartics and so-called blood
â¢â¢purifiers" will find in Stuart's Calcium-;
Wafers a far 6afer, more palatable and
[effective preparation.

" THAT CARNEGIE TRUST. .
Among the papers found to-day in

with Iri Reynolds by- Mrs. 'Chadwick
was what purported to be a copy of "a
trust agreement between Andrew Car
negie and Mrs. Chadwick. The docu
ment is as follows: . .;*)''â¢-
**Know all men by these presents:
That I, Andrew Carnegie of New York
CJty, do hereby acknowledge that I
hold in trust for Mrs. Cassie L. Chad
wick, wife of Dr. Leroy S. Chadwick
of 18,24 Euclid avenue, city of Cleve
land, county of Cuyahoga and State of
Ohio, property assigned and delivered
to me for said Cassie, L. Chadwick by
her uncle, Fred B. Mason, in his life
time (now deceased), which property
is of the. approximated value of ten
million two hundred, and forty-six
thousand dollars ($10,246,000), con
sisting of' 2500 shares of Great West
ern Railway stock of England and
Wales,. valued at two million one hun
dred thousand dollars ($2,100,000);
1S00 shares of Caledonian Railway
stock of Scotland, valued at one mil
lion ona hundred and forty-six thou
sand dollars, ($1,146,000), and bonds
of the United States Steel Corporation
of New Jersey, bearing 5 per cent (five
per cent) interest, of the par value
of seven million dollars ($7,000,000).
PAYMENT OF THE "INCOME."
"The income from the above de
scribed property I agree to pay over
to said Cassie L. Chadwick semi-an
nually, between the first and fifteenth
days of June and December cf each
year during the life of this trust, with

vices or expense of any . kind, this

dorsed over in the name .of said Cassie

on the termination of this trust.
"Witness my hand and seal this 27th
day of February. 1901.
"ANDREW CARNEGIE."
REYNOLDS ONE OF THE DUPES.
In the same package with the trust
agreement was a note made payable to
Cassie L. Chadwick dated May 20, 1902,
for $5,000,000 and payable in fifteen
months. It was signed with the name
of Andrew -Carnegie.
The Plain Dealer asserts that the sig
nature of Andrew Carnegie has appar
ently been forged on notes and- other
papers to the total amount of $13,750,
000. The securities held by Reynolds,
together with those that were held by
the Citizens' National Bank of Oberlin,
and which have already, been made
public, aggregate this amount. The
Plain Dealer adds:
"There is a bitter Irony in the fact
that the very man who held this
worthless paper. so faithfully and tena
ciously for J Mrs. Chadwick and who
apparently believed in its worth im
plicitly should himself be one of the
heaviest losers. ; Iri Reynolds, after his
long course of faithful guardianship for
the woman he .trusted, now considers
himself a dupe. It is stated as a fact
not hitherto known that Reynolds
loaned Mrs. Chadwick practically all
the money he possessed. His entangle
ments, however, involve only himself,
the Wade Park Bank being in no way
affected.".

CONFESSION OF. BECK.
OBERLIN, Ohio, Dec. 10.â The con
fession .of President C. T. Beckwith of
the wrecked Citizens' National Bank of
Oberlin; now in, the possession 'of the
Federal authorities, is a story so start
ling'with relation to the monumental
transactions of Mrs. Chadwick as to be
almost unbelievable. ' But documentary
proof haR forced . itself upon the part
of the few who have heard the amazing
tale, which is expected to : prove the
absolute undoing of Mrs. Chadwick.
. The unequivocal statement is made
in the confession of President Beckwith
that Mrs. Chadwick secured the im
mense loans by a written promise de
livered into 'the hands of the banker
that the Citizens' Bank would be made
the trustee of the $5,000,000 estate
which has just .been revealed to the
world as an absolute myth.
The : written . promise . delivered by
Mrs. Chadwick to Beckwith was. to. the
effect that her. affairs would.be turned
over to the Oberlin. bank- July 1, 1903.
In : consideration therefor,. President
Beckwith : and fCashler Spear, were I to
receive â¢. (10,000 . a â  year.', each > for' their
trouble.' In ' addition the bank ' was to
be given a bonus 'of "close to $40,000
when the loans had all' been paid back.
This statement answers fully the oft
repeated question, "What actuated ' the
two officials of ' the Oberlin . "_ bank in
making the immense" loans 'from* the
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, DECEMBER 11. 1904.
bank's funds, without a scintilla of
actual security?"
CAIiMS VlCmiS* FEARS.
The story of how Mrs. Chadwick
played with the two bankers after hav
ing the money once in her power, as
told by Beckwith, Is of absorbing inter
est Mrs. Chadwick calmed the fears
of her victims with the claim that she
was a relative of Andrew Carnegie.
" The written confession of Beckwith
goes into details of the explanation
made by Mrs. Chadwick as to the man
ner in which the estate was then be
ing handled. The Wade Park Bank-
Ing Company of Cleveland was used
simply as a depository for the securi
ties, acoording to the tale that the
Cleveland woman made the bankers
believe. .The estate was said by Mrs.
Chadwick to be "in the hands of three
trustees, ". all - New. York men. The
name of one of them was. given as
"William Baldwin. Mrs. Chadwick said
she. could not get hold of the money
except through Baldwin, whom the
banker now believes to be a mythical
person. Baldwin attended to all the
business of handling the Interest from
the bonds and turned it over to. Mrs.
Chadwick. as it became due. â  The
bankers were told that the yearly in
come was $760,000. Repeated; efforts
were made on the part of Beckwith to
get into communication with Baldwin,
but they were always unsuccessful.
An excuse was always ready when in
quiry concerning Baldwin was pressed.
IiURE HELD OUT . TO BANK.
The Oberlin bank was to be' made
"the trustee of the estate as soon as
the contract with the then alleged
trustees was ended, which was said to
be July 1, 1903. When July 1Â« of last
year came around matters were said
to be in such shape as to make it nec
essary for the estate to remain in the
same hands for some' little time longer.
With the end of their troubles in sight
and a golden harvest within their grasp,
as the Oberlin bankers Welieved, they
were put joft to commence upon \ a
period of torturous anticipation, which
ended with the closing of the doors
of the institution and the arrest of
both the president and cashier.
In relation to the indorsement of
the notes by Beckwith and Spear, the
Story from the banker goes on to re
late that the notes were indorsed only
as a last recourse in the desperate
chase for funds. He confessed that
he had intended to attempt to nego
tiate, loans upon the notes, but his
nerve failed him. The indorsements
were- put on, it was explained, to make
the paper more. bankable.
The confession practically tells a
story., of how the Oberlin bank had
been vised as a clearing-house for Mrs.
Chadwick's manipulations. One in
stance is that of the $5000 note held by
W. I- Fay and Henry Wurst of Elyria.
The note was given by Mrs. Chadwick
to Fay and Wurst, with diamonds as
security. They pressed for payment,
and finally threatened to sell the jew-'
pis. In her dilemma the woman, ap
pealed, to Beckwith. Both were- of the
opinion that the public sale of the dia
monds would caupe talk.^nd endanger
the plans that had been made. Beck
with settled the problem by taking Up
the note, giving his personal note -in
steadâa note which iie later took up
by paying the. cash.
RANKER, THREATENS SUICIDE.
. One â¢ tragic incident related by Beck
with in the Written confession' con
cerns a visit of President Beckwith,
Cashier Spear and Judge Albaugh - to
the Cleveland home of Mrs. Chadwick.
The two bankers pleaded for money.
Mrs. Ohadwick made more promises.
Beckwith jvas aroused to anger, and
when he saw the hopelessness of It all
he threatened to commit suicide. He
drew a revolver. Mrs. Chadwick cried
that "all would be lost" if the banker
carried out his threat. The result was
that the bankers again relied upon
promises. â¢â  - -
Many times the bank was pressed for
funds. When dividends were to be met
the president and cashier skirmished
for funds. In order to h$lp them out
Mrs. Chadwick at one time gave them
a check for $S0,000, which came back
marked "No funds."' She gave two
more checks. for $25,000 each,- but the
ntbtt day telephoned; to > Beckwith not
to use tHem. The president and cash
ier Were perplexed : at times to make
a â¢ proper showing to the directors.
Noter, securities and cash were check
ed up and the sum represented by the
loans to Mrs. Chadwick was carried as
cash deposits in Cleveland banka/Iri

that time she had borrowed more than

several places in Europe, but .'Dr..

HOW NEOTON AVAS LANDED.
BOSTON, Dec. 10.â Herbert . D.
Newton made a statement this after
noon to clear and establish in the pub
lic mind, he said, how he came to be
financially involved with Mrs. Chad
wick. â¢â  . â 
"Mrs. Chadwick came to Boston
last April." he said. "She was sent
here by Rev. Charles Eaton, pastor of
the Euclid-avenue Baptist Church, of
Cleveland.- Dr. Eaton had been ap~
pealed to by her as a woman in dis
tress and acted as. a pastor to help
her out.- She came to the office of
John E. Eaton in the Tremont build
ing, where Eaton is a member of the
law firm of Eaton, McKnight & Car
ver. She carried instructions from
Dr. Eaton of Cleveland to give her
assistance if, after examination of her
securities, her statements could be
verified. . :
"It. was in Mr. Eaton's office In the
Tremont building that John E. Eaton
introduced Mrs. Chadwick to me. ,<At
this meeting Mrs. Chadwick showed
me the securities she held and among
thorn was the- $500,000 note signed
'Andrew Carnegie', and also the cer
tificate signed by Ira Reynolds, which
stated that he had in his* possession
$5,000,000 in securities belonging to
Mrs. Chadwick. â¢ We communicated
with the Rev. Dr. Eaton and he con
firmed the signature of 'Reynolds, â ';
"The .signature on the $500,000 Car
negie note was never verified beyond
Mrs. Chadwlck's own . statements. .
â¢ "Later Reynolds personally-acknowl
edged his signature on the certificate
of .securities, and the strictest inquiry
showed that Reynolds- was supposed to
enjoy in the city of Cleveland the
reputation of being a man of the high
est integrity and honor. So in -this
way you can see that both representa
tions made by the Rev. Dr. . Eaton
have been fully certified.
"Upon these representations I de

agreed to let her have $14,000. I paid
the money to- John, B. Eaton and- he

ARTISTIC WORLD
London Marvel
at Substitution in Fagan's
"Prayer of' the Sword"
IDEALS ARE SHATTERED
Tragedy in Blank Verso
to Be Withdrawn Notwith
standing Manager's Coup
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, Dec. 10.â Art, with a cap
ital A, got a setback at the Adelphl
Theater recently, when "The Prayer
of the Sword," by James Bernard Fa
gan, was "popularized." This is the
play which was put on with such un
common earnestness a few weeks ago.
Practically all concerned in its .pro
duction â author, producer and leading
man and woman â were old "Benson
lans"âthat is, former members of the
famous company which has played
Shakespeare in the provinces for so
many yearsâ and all were animated by
the highest sort of ideals.- The two
stars of the production were Oscar
Aeche and I41y Brayton, both of whom
had- distinguished themselves under
Beerbohm Tree's Btandard. As for the
play itself, it was a. really ambitious
effort. It was a tragedy in blank verse,
whose hero, a monk, vf ell in love wjth
a medieval. Italian Princess and threw
aeide his cowl and took up the sword
for his country and his lady love. At
the end, however, the heroine was
stabbed by the villain with a poisoned
dagger and the. final curtain fell upon
her death. '.V*' â  â  â 
SUPERBLY MOUNTED.
â  The piece was mounted superbly and
acted with force. It reached its fiftieth
performance, but there was a general
understanding in theatrical circles that
indifferent business only was being
doneâ No one, however, anticipated
such a managerial coup which has just
beem carried out. A, short j time ago
the play. was presented with an entire
ly new last act,; in which th# heroine
escaped the poisoned dagger and the
Impression ;was conveyed that she and
the hero were going to get marrtM and
live happily ever after. Of course, thÂ«s
thing has called forth a great outcry.
It is paid that no such' drastic change
has ever been made In a play*by a Brit
ish dramatist after the piece had bÂ«en
produced. Pinero brightened the end
ing of his "Profligate," but he did it
at the behest of his manager before the
public had seen it. ; .
In reality, however, the surrender
to Mornus which has been made at the
Adelphl is not as regrettable as it
8eems^or "The .Prayer of the Sword,"
thougnMofty In aim, was not a good
ple.ee of work, and its failure to at
tract the public is not a sign that the
public will not patronize poetic drama
of real worth. Stephen Phillips' plays,
"Herod" and "Paolo and Francesca,"

SCUDAMORE-S DEATH.
Frank Scudamore, who died the
other day under strange and tragic
circumstances, was a comparatively
little known dramatist, but one whose
plays, among certain classes, achieved
wide popularity. He was not troubled
by any lofty notions of the missions of
the stage. He made it his chief con
cern to find out what took the best
with the public and then did the best
to "give it to them. He paid no heed
to Emerson's injunction," "Hitch your
wagon to a star." Iri one of his melo
dramas. "Is Life Worth Living?" he
hitched it to < a seam roller, and the
latter made such a hltthat thereafter he
devoted his attention to the introduc
tion of novel mechanical features on
the stasfe. He claimed to be the first
to .utilize a phonograph in the drama.

VAST SUMS OF MONEY
SPENT BY TOURISTS
Switzerland Alone Annually Collects
$30,000,000 From Americans
and Others.
It needed a painstaking German to
f gure for us a set of statistics long de
eired, but of a sort that nobody cared
to tackle the tedium or the difficulty of
computing thorn. These figures are the
annual number of tourists in Europe
and the amount of money they spend.
The German's estimates cover the to
tals in both items, and, large as their
number is. the Americans do not con
stitute quite the whale of the globe's
yearly nomad population. But what
quantity of Americans do visit the old
world and what amount of money they
leave there may be guessed from this
German's computations.
Switzerland. he says, entertains
through the year 3,000,000 visitors, who
spend $30,000,000. Italy, the Riviera and
Spain between them attract an expend
iture of f69.000.000. The various great
capitals in all cull 545.000,000 that come
from the pockets of the 900,000 visitors
to Paris, the G00.000 to London, the 500,
000 to Berlin and the 250.000 to Vienna,
The baths and seaside resorts accom

"At 3 o'clock on the morning of De

"Subsequently, at 5 o'clock in the

The enemy gradually increased to
about a battalion and pressed our out
post for the purpose of enveloping it
from the northeast and from the west

fiercely ehelled Lamuting from the di
rection of Hanchlapao and Sufangtai,

leaving several dead behind him. Our
casualties were two men slightly

"On the morning of December 8 our

Government Tobacco 3Ionopoly.
According to a law recently enacted,
though the Government of Ja;.an has
the exclusive right of tobacco manu

tories established in various parts of
the country. The manufactured ar
ticle is to be 6</ld to retailers through
the hands of wholesale merchants and
then to the consumer, the wholesale
merchants and retailers to be appoint
ed by the Government. In the case
of cigarettes the new monopoly law
went into effect in July, 1904, and the
requirements regarding cut tobacco
will go Into effect in April, 1905. The
tariff on cigars, cigarettes, snuff and
cut tobacco from the United States is
150 per cent under the law which went
into effect April 1. 1903.â Philadelphia

ISO insane aliens who had been inmates
of foreign insane asylums are now

average annual immigration into this
country a large percentage that should
come under the head of "undesirable"
and be returned to their native shores

Japanese Lose a
Cruiser and
Forty Men.
TOKIO, Dec. 10.â The Japanese cruis
er Saiyen struck a mine and sank on
November 30. The majority of her crew
were rescued. The Navy Department
has issued the following announce
ment:
"A detached squadron, with the Sai
yen as the flagship, while co-operating
with the armv in bombarding the en
emy at Port Arthur was at -the' same
time engaged in blockading in " force.
The Saiyen struck a mine of the enemy
on November 30 and was soon en
veloped in smoke. The gun vessel Aka
gi, which was engaged in shelling the
enemy, immediately stopped work and
came to the rescue of the sinking
cruiser. Finding that the Saiyen was
making water rapidly, the Akagl an
chored near her and, co-operating with
other comrade ships arid launches, suc
ceeded in rescuing fifteen officers and
175 men, but Captain Tajima and thir
ty-eight others went down with the
ship.
"The Saiven, commanding the de
tached squadron, was often exposed to
dangers, yet often effected distin
guished services. It is highly regretta
ble that such a ship should have met
with such a great misfortune."
The Saiyen, formerly called the Tsl
yuen, was launched at Stettin, Prussia,
in 1883. Her displacement was 2261 tons
and she had an indicated horsepower of
2800. Her EDeed was fourteen knots.
FEAR CITADEL. AYILL. FALL.
French' Are Losing Faith in Port Ar
thur's Impregnability.
PARIS. Dec. 10. â The Port Arthur
crisis is shaking the faith of French
military critics, who heretofore have
bc-en positive that the fortress is im
pregnable. There is an inner line of
defenses, they claim, whereas the Brit
ish critics deny that any inner line
exists.
There is reason to believe that the
French view is based on the recent
personal observations of Lieutenant de
Cuverville, the French naval attache
at Port Arthur, who mysteriously dis
appeared. Prior to his disappearance
he gave the headquarters' staff elab
orate reports, leading to the belief
that the fortress was capable of fur
ther lengthy endurance.
A leading naval authority expresses
thi belief that the Japanese, after de
feating the Russian second Pacific
sauadron, will send a Japanese squad
ron to European waters over the route
that Admiral Rojestvensky's squad
ron has traveled. He points out that
the coaling of the vessels of the Pacific
squadron at Dakar, Jibutil and French
ports has established a precedent,
which in turn will be an expected ad
vantage to the Japanese, as the latter's
squadron, coming to Europe, will be
in a position to ask for coal at the
same ports now supplying the Rus
sians.

Exchange Their
Swords Prior
to War.
TOKIO, Dec. 10.â An interesting
story of the great struggle at arms be
tween Japan and Russia lies in a long
established personal friendship be
tween General Terauchi, Minister of
War of Japan, and General Kuropat
kin, commander in chief of the Rus
sian armies in Manchuria, and an ex
change of ( swords as presents between
them on ithe eve of war. Kuropat
kin and Terauchi met in Paris
twenty years ago. Terauchi, then a
major, was military attache to the
Japanese legation in the French capi
tal, and Kuropatkin, a major general
at that time, went to France to ob
serve the military maneuvers. The
two soldiers first met officially and
there soon sprang up between them a
feeling of warm friendship and regard.
They parted in Paris and did not meet
until Kuropatkin came to Japan last
year. The lapse of years had brought
Increased rank and Cabinet portfolios
for both and their reunion was an
Interesting one. ...
Events were then moving rapidly
toward war, but the rupture had not
come and the two Ministers met as
friends and freely enjoyed the reunion.
When Kuropatkin was about to leave
Japan for home Terauchi presented to
him a Japanese sword with a blade of
the finest workmanship apd an inter
esting history. When he reached, St.
Petersburg Kuropatkin gave an order
for the manufacture of a Russian
sword for his friend Terauchi. It was
finished and' dispatched in December
and reached the Japanese capital a
week before Togo's guns opened fire
on Port Arthur.
A somewhat peculiar thing about
the Russian sword is that it reached
Tokio with the blade keenly sharpened
a custom followed by officers as a rule
only in time of war, and among the
few who knew of the existence of the
weapon there has been much discus
sion as to why it was sharpened. The
sword is a handsome weapon. It is
shaped more' like a saber than the
conventional sword of the time, it has
a handle of gold and the black scab
bard in which it rests is tipped with
gold.' Despite the gulf that divides
the two peoples, despite. the fact that
their soldiers and skill are pitted in a
gigantic struggle. Terauchi speaks
fondly and' respectfully of his old sbl
dier friend. Indeed, throughout all
Japan Kuropatkin is held in distinct
respect by the people at large, many
of whom believe tha*. if he had been
at home in Russia last year the men
who made the war would never have
gained the ascendency.

of daily occurrence at the revival
meetings conducted by Evans Roberts,
the collier preacher of Wales. All sorts

equally affected by his exhortations
and abandon themselves to frenzies of

Under his magic influence young

crowded congregations, who are moved
to tears by their eloquence. Rough, un

that seems inspired. Respectable, con

scenes above all things, give way un

"Welsh Wesley." But it would be dif
ficult to conceive of a man who dif
fers more widely from the renowned
founder of modern Methodism. Of
learning and culture he possesses only
the barest, rudiments. Theology is to
him a. sealed book. Until a few months
ago he was- working in a colliery and
there was little to distinguish ,him
from mindr^ds of men among whom he
was carnine: his daily bread. He is
2(> years old, of middle height, fair
haired and with light blue eyes that no
one could correctly characterize s.s ex
pressive.
Apart from h'.s religious work he dis
plays none of those extraordinary
psychological qualities which 'invest
him with puch wonderful powers Â» in
the pulpit. In private life he is utter
ly lacking in personal magnetism. He
is shy, nervous, awkward, and his
speech Is far from fluent. On meeting
him for the first time one inevitably
falls to wondering as to the secret of
his tremendous influence as an evan
gelist.
RECEIVED A MESSAGE.
His own story of it is far more inter
esting than any theory that may be
advanced to account for it. In the
collieries he pondered much over the
problems of life as presented by those
among whom his lot had been cast,
and came to th<? conclusion that relig
ion alone â Christian religion â could
moke happiness and blessedness com
patible with grinding toll. He saved
â what he could from his wages that he
might enter a nonconformist college
and study for the ministry. He had
been there only a few weeks when
something happened. â¢
"I was baptised by the Spirit there,"
he told a visitor. "Afterward it sent
me a message. 'Go home for a week,'
it commanded. So I obeyed. At my
home another message was given me.
It told me to ko forth with three wo
men. Their names were even mention-

ed. â¢ ' I â  communicated â¢ the message to
them. They obeyed. Two others "fol-;
lowed."
"How â¢rtaSjtlils baptism of <the Spirit
manifeStedr he was asked. ' ' '
"God. seized hold of me. He pressed
me down to the earth. I felt the weight
of his hand.UDon.me, for my face wjis
purple. My mother .had" tlie same ex
perience when .she .-was' converted! She
fell to the . ground, so that, â¢ people
thoug-ht she: was ill. I have'surren
dered "my life to the keeping: of the
Spirit. I go where it 1 summons me.
Even now I am. waiting the' Master's
bidding. Ah, It is' a grand life.. I am
s.o happy, so happy. that I could walk
on air. Tired ?. Never. God has, made
me strong. He has given me courage.
I could face millions." ' ' '
. SI^*CKRE IX HIS FAITH.
The sincerity of his faith in. all' this is
beyond, question.. Fired with the sense
of a divine mission miraculously com
municated, when he addresses himself
to the fulfillment of it all rhls. awk
wardness, :â  shyness < and/ self-restraint
vanish. In 'the pulpit he Is absolutely
devoid of ' self-consciousness. His face
glows with the enthusiafeni that con
sumes him. He takes no thought of
what he Is to say, he will tell you, and
yet he is never a.t a loss lor a phrase.
He holds his congregation for hours.
In some strange fashion he imparts to
them the same frenzy that possesses
him. As he speaks .men and women
bury their fades in "their.. hands and
sob aloud. When he pauses, others
jump to their feet and put .forth their
petitions or stories of marvelous 'con
version and contrition. It may be that
some rough, unkempt* toller, who has
never spoke'n a tfprd ln public *efore,
â¢will pray and exhort a fluency
and fervor* that knows ho check^until
exhaustion overpowers him. ..\ .
And. yet., this untutored, preacher,
â whose .Influence over hisrauditors ex-
ceeds that of the most gifted divine, is
in*;jio sense an. .orator, even in' : what
might- be termed Jlils most inspired
niorpents. .r There Ais^np method in his
a'fldr^ifees.t^fl'rinted^verbatira l they
would-, make ippor. ''reading. ..But they
move his hearers as people are never
stirred >by the most renowned of pulpit
orators.
. He differs from all, revivalists in the
wqy he reveals the joy and. happiness
his faith has brought him. He smiles
when he > prays;- he -gives way to bursts
of laughter when he -exhorts. His re
ligion v is full of mirth. Perhaps this may
account in some measure .for the won
drous influence he. exercises. For most
of those composing his audiences this
life is hard and sordid, and they must
feel it is worth- something to obtain
such happiness as he has found. But it
is precisely this feature of his work
over which many "Welsh ministers
shake their heads in grave disapproval.
With them religion Is a solemn busi
ness, and laughter in church or chapel
appears hardly less a desecration than
an oath. They don't know what to
make of the collier preacher's use of it.
But the common people" at least have
no. such misgivings. The collier preach
er has. taken them -.by storm and, his
success among them is assured. They
want. a religion that will give them a
lively sense of happiness in this world
as well as assurance of It in the next,
and .'this it is that Evan Roberts pre
sents to them. . - .:
CKASE WORK TO PRAY.
At many factories men have stopped
work to hold prayer meetings, and pro
prietors complain that this -leads to a
serious loss of money. At a big tinplate
works the other morning^the men all
dropped thelr'-tools and for three-quar
ters of an hour they held a praper
meeting, Ayhile the machinery stood
idle. They prayed for the manager, too.
He would rather have had the money
lost -while they were praying than their
prayers.
"If a man wishes to commune with
his Maker," he said, "he should do so
in the; solitude of his bedchamber or.'ln
his church 6r:chai>eL^A large worksite
the wrong place.'. Ifthi3 thing, goes, o'n
we shall have to do something to put
a stop to it." â  â¢ â <
It is understood that when the collier
pjea^her finishes his mission he will re
sume his studies; for the ministry. â .

STOCK VALUES
Market Closes Very Strong
Notwithstanding a Heavy
liquidation During Week
RUM0KS STIR BK0KEES
Speculators Make a Quick
Becovery From the Crash
Due to Thursday's Flurry
..NE^YORK, Dec 10/â Further prog
ress .TvaB, made in to-day's two-hour
session toward restoring the impair
ment of ' values In, the stock market
caused by the, week's heavy liquidation.
The -larrest -declines have been very
much reduced. There was some evi
dence of renewed < liquidation In some
spots at times, but the whole -market
became very strong: In the late trading
and closed firm near the best. The cov
ering of short contracts by a retreating
bear party .apparently played a consid
erable part In the rise, and the demand
was rather urgent at some 'points, no
tably in Amalgamated Copper.
Rumors were revived of property con
solidations, - coming dividend . surprises,
capital readjustment and other symp
tom* which t characterized the market
up- to .the time of the crash, and the
speculation took on much the same ap
pearance as before that event. North
ern Securities touched* a new high reo
ord on the curb, and the settlement ru
mors regarding that i corporation re
newed their potent effect' on specula
tive sentiment. The bank statement
conformed to . calculations In the cash
Item, and. the stock market liquidation
waa-reflected In the loan contraction of
$8,513,500, resulting In an addition to
the surplus reserve of $826,125.- Foreign
exchange turned firm,' and Berlin's re
newed demand on London for gold at
tracted attention. Total sales of bonds,
par value, $2,635,000. '
Heavy liquidation has occurred this
week in the stock market, and the. In
creasing momentum, of the downward
movement â¢ resulted in a crash oh
Thursday, which took on the propor
tions of a panic 'during an hour. No
failures resulted, and the market quick
ly showed the relief caused by the clos
ing out of \veak accounts. and recovered
violently. It was not free from feverish
symptoms subsequently, and was en
tirely natural after the spasmodic uri
settlement of values and the readjust
ments which were made necessary. Dis
cussion of - the causes of -theÂ».;'break
pointed, to t one and another fact, and
the combination of all of. them may
have helped to topple the market over.
But the opinion Is agreed ' that the
market has become extremely vulner
able and topheavy arid ; needs only a
Elight impulse to tip it- over. . .
The drop in prices from the extreme
high to the extreme "low level of the
week ran between ten and twenty-flve
points fcr a considerable number of
important -properties and proved suffi
cient to bring into the market. an im
portant demand of a substantial In-:
vestment character, which began to
absorb the stream of liquidation and
take it out of the market.' The slump
in" stocks had .some 'Immediate effect
on the markets for other staple com
modities, .especially grain', 'cotton arid
copper, and some further, reflex effect
is looked for in other departments. But
confidence in the- general- soundness of
the financial and business condition
seems unimpaired in the financial dis
trict and the svock market itself gives
abundant evidence- of -its improved
health . by^ reason of the sweeping out
of weak points and its settlement to a
more -substantial basis of prices.
'Bonds 'were affected In sympathy
with stocks/ but in less degTee. United
States 2's and the olds have advanced
& v E[nd the new 4's registered "4 per

Weekly CalU $1 per YearWEBER LAUGHS
AT INDICTMENT
Grand Jury Beturns a True
Bill Accusing Him of the
Bobbery of County Bank
DOES NOT TBOUBLE HIM
Says Filing of the Charge
Is Much More Easy Than
Proving the Truth of It
Special Dlaiwtcb. to TbÂ« CalL
AUBURN, Dec. 10.â The Grand Jury
to-day brought In an Indictment charg
ing Adolph Weber with the robbery, of
the Placer County Bank on May 26
laet. The amount stolen was $6365, of
which JSrVOO was found by the officers
In the Weber barn shortly after the
murder of the family. Young Weber
has been held to answer for the kill
ing: of hia mother and the date for
that trial will be set next Monday. He
has also an Indictment han grins: ever
him for the killing of his father. If
he escapes conviction on these chargea
he will be charged with the murder
of his sister and little brother.
The cpntest over the administrator
ship of the Weber estate will be heard
next Monday. Public Administrator
fihepard. who is acting as special ad
ministrator, is opposed bjr John Ad
ams, Weber's g"uaxdian. . â¢
Among the minor indictments
brought in to-day by the Grand Jury
was orw for perjury against C. H.
Heinrich. who. it Is alleged, certified
falsely about some land at Roseville
during a lawsuit with his wife. Hein
rich shortly after the Weber murders
etatrd that he heard a man in San
Francisco say that young Weber did
not commit the crime, but that he
knew who did. The officers, knowing
Heinrichs' standing as to veracity, paid
little attention to this statement.
Weber spent a very quiet day. No
one saw him but Jailer Fulton. To him
Weber said he was feeling line and
only wished he could get outside for
an hour and take one of his constitu
tionals. When informed that the Grand
Jury had brought in an indictment
against him for robbery, he laugh
ingly said: "I expected it. as troubles
r.ever come fiinely. But the next thing
â will be to prove the charge."
Weber has gained flesh since his in
carceration In Jail, and beyond a lit
tle paleness looks well. His only trou
ble, he ean, is his stomach.
WORKING TX) GET
STATE APPROPRIATION
l>airyincn Hope to Secure the Estab
lishment of a California Agricul
tural Experiment Station.
STOCKTON, Dec. 10. â To secure a
State appropriation of $500,000 for the
establishment of a California agricul
tuial experiment station is thb object
toward which Charles , and Frank
Fierce, owners of the Riverside dairy
en Rough and Ready Island, ln this
county, are now bending their ener
gies.
They have had a draft prepared for
a bill to be submitted to the Legisla
ture at its coming session calling for
the appropriation of the sum men
tioned. This draft names five men
to handle the funds, among them being
Chief Justice Beatty. President Ben
jKmin lde Wheeler of the State Uni
versity and President Jordan of Stan
ford.
It is not the intention to carry on
experiments on segregated tracts lo
cated in different parts of the State,
but to have one large farm situated
at some place to be selected by the
five trustees after the appropriation is
made.
The scheme is very broad in its
scope. It includes the improvement of
eeed with the object of increasing the
yield, diversified farming, dairying,
stock raising, gardening, viticulture,
enrichment of the soil, and, in fact,
all the branches of agriculture and
pursuits closely connected with them.
ELECTION IS EXCITING
VOTERS OP DAWSON CITY
Trouble May Follow Refusal of Of
ficers to Furnish Independent Can
didate With list of Voters.
DAWSON' CITY, Y. T. f Dec. 10. â
Intense excitement prevails in the city
because of the failure of the registra
tion officers to deliver copies of the
voters' list to the agent of Dr. Wilfrid
Thompson, the independent and anti-
Government candidate for the Can
adian Parliament, running in opposi
tion to ex-Governor Congdon, the Gov
ernment candidate. Political feeling
runs so high that violence is feared
en election day, particularly if the
registration officers persist in their re
fusal to deliver the lists as required
by law.
Orders have been received from the
Canadian Secretary of State directing
Returning Officer Pierre Ledieu to
turn thÂ« list over to Thompson's rep
resentative.
MiddJeton Will Be Extradited.
SACRAMENTO, Dec. 10. â Governor
Pardee to-day issued extradition
papers upon the Governor of the State
of Washington for the return to this
State of J, A. MIddletonJ a fugitive
from Justice. Middleton is wanted in
Fresno County for grand larceny. - He
was arrested at that place " for the
theft of a bicycle, 'was released on bail
ln the sum of $250 and then fled from
the city. He is in custody at Aber
deen, Wash.
Bojs Believed Drowned Are Safe.
STOCKTON, Dec. 10. â Louis Freitas
and the Martin lad. who were believed
to have b*-en frowned, are safe. They
had merely overreached themselves,
going down thÂ« river so far that they
were unable to get back before dark
and concluded to wait until the fol
lowing day. remaining in a cabin all
night. r
Injured In n Street Car Accident.
TACOMA, Dec 10.â As a result of a
street f*7 Jumping the track last
night Commissioner of Public Works
William Welch; Pejer Debroe. super
intendent of city water mains; James
Lee. a street contractor, and Curley
Doans. a resident of South Tacoma,
were badly cut and bruised.
A Worthy Charity.
The Buford Free Kindergarten will
hold a Christmas tree Thursday at the
school room in South Ban Francisco,
corner of Railroad avenue and Fifteenth
avenue. Donations sent to Mrs. E. M.
Jones, 1820 Washington street, will be
very acceptable. The Buford Kindergar
ten is one of the oldest in San Francisco
and is doing most commendable work
among the poor in that section of the
city. A grift to the Institution now.
while It may demand but slight self de
nial, will surely richly reward the donor
and contribute much toward filling some
childish -heart with Christmas cheer.

CONTINUE DAILY
Proof Coming In Which
Shows That the Richness of
Goldeld Is Beyond Expecta
tion
Dealing in Tonopah and Goldfleld
stocks Is still more than brisk. Daily
reports are received from the fields by
the prominent brokers which show
clearly that practically everywhere de
velopment work is producing incontest
able proof that within a short while the
district will be known as more than a
second Comstock. In this connection
W. Baer Ewing, the well-known brok
er, received the following telegram:
GOL.DF1ELD (Nev.). December 2. 1904. â
"W. Baer Ewlns. Italian-American Bank Bldff.,
S. F. : Bljf Elk assey December 1, one hun
dred and three dollars and twenty cents.
I* E. WILSON.
"The Big Elk mine," he explained,
â¢when asked about the matter, "is cer
tainly excellently located, and the de
velopment work done places 'the prop
erty, in my opinion, as one of the 'cer
tainties* in Goldfleld. Sometimes pros
pects do not turn into realities, but in
this Instance the company has cause to
be more than satisfied with results."
Following up this train of thought,
he said: "In selecting good investment
property, the sensible man looks at lo
cation first. Then, when development
work proves the value of the claims,
eafety is insured. The Big Elk is a
case in point. The owners of the prop
wry were satisfied as soon as work had
fairly commenced, but daily results are
more encouraging. Treasury stock that
was sold at 2 cents a couple of months
ago now can be had cmly at 5, and in
my opinion it is worth 10 to-day."
Mr. Ewing said that he would gladly
give any information about either the
Big Elk or other properties in Goldfleld
or Tonopah to any one who would call
on him or write to him at his offices,
Italian-American Bank building, 456
Montgomery street.
ACTION ON STATEHOOD
BILL IS POSTPONED
Arizona's Protest Against Consolida
tion With New Mexico Supported
by Senator Bard.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 10.â The Senate
Committee on Territories, at a meeting
this morning decided to postpone ac
tion on the statehood bill until next
week. The bill was read and discussed,
but owing to the absence of some of
the members of the committee, action
was not taken. After the meeting
Senator Beveridge, chairman of the
committee, said that the committee un
doubtedly would take favorable action
on the bill. Another meeting will be
held tin Monday.
The people of Arizona have made
protest against the feature of the bill
which consolidates that territory with
New Mexico as one State, and have
asked for a hearing which the commit
tee evinces disposition to grant.
Senator Bard of California, a member
of the committee, to-day announced his
opposition to consolidation, expressing
the opinion that statehood should not
be forced on the people of Arizona In
opposition to their wishes.

ly "Joshed" by Members

clever schemes which had been con
cocted for their especial benefit.
An attempt to reorganize the Demo
cratic party, in which j Cleveland,
Bryan, Watson, Debs, Davis, Taggart
and others were personated by mem
bers of the club, and into which a for
tune teller full of wit and alive to the
general situation Injected himself,
made the hit of the evening.
The dead-letter office, to which a
member cf the club had recently been
appointed chief, was opened and some
curious and unheard-of letters relat
ing to prominent guests were un
earthed.
The musical feature was one of the
best, and topical songs, choruses and
solos, dedicated especially to those' who
sat at tables, were enjoyed during the
dinner.

LIVE FOR DAYS
ON AN ICEBERG
Awf ul Experience of Three
Men Who Deserted Whaler
Beluga 'in the Bering Sea
ESKIMOS RESCUE j THEM
Nearly Die From Exposure
and Want of Food Before
Natives > Discover Them
Special Dispatch to The Call.
TACOMA. Dec. 10.â Living for three
days on floating Icebergs in the Bering
Sea, without food or water, was the
experience of Wynne Heryford, a
young variety, actor of San Francisco,
who shipped from that city as a sailor
on the Beluga last March.
Heryford, along with eight other
novices, took a strong dislike to Mate
Seymour and resolved to desert the
vessel when an opportunity came. Six
of his companions left the whaler in
the Bering Sea and started over the Ice
to the land, seven miles distant. Hery
ford and two others followed half an
hour later. These three soon came to
broken Ice, which arrested their prog
ress. Boarding a small piece of ice they
used their hands and legs as paddles
until the solid ice was reached again.
Half-way to land a current caught and
carried them fifteen miles seaward.
That night a counter current carried
them back toward land. .
When within a half mile of shore a
squaw and two Eskimo boys rescued
them with a canoe. For three days they
had had no food. Their hands and legs
were bleeding from contact with the
salt water. Their hunger had become
so terrible that they had discussed the
advisability of drawing lots to decide
which of the three should be killed for
food. *
After filling up on seal meat and
drying their clothes In an Eskimo vil
lage, the trio took a long sleep. At
Teller they found th^ six men who had
preceded them. They took a schooner
for Nome. Heryford returned on the
steamship Roanoke on her last voy
age. He is now playing in Seattle.

Delirious From Fever
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELKS; Dec. 10.â Miss An
nie L. Peabodv. sister of Josiah C.
Peabody, was* asphyxiated at her home
on Boyle Heights to-night under par
ticularly pathetic circumstances. With
her brother, who for years has been a
newspaper man here, she lived on the
lower floor of a flat. About 9:30 o'clock
to-night the people upstairs smeUed"
pras. They made an investigation, v but
the gas was so strong that /they were
unable to enter the lower part of the
houss. Through a window the body of
the woman could be seen, and in an
other room Peabody qould be seen in
bed. It was supposed both were dead.
Policemen with handkerchiefs over
their faces entered the room where the
woman lay, secured her body and open
ed the windows. Gas was escaping
from a small stove. The gas had not
reached Peabody's room. It was found
that he was suffering from typhoid
fever and yvas delirious.
Investigation showed that his sister
had been attending to his wants and
had not slept for forty hours. She had
gone to a small cooking stove, heated
some water and then as she supposed
turned off Â£he gas, but she must have
turned it on again. She was so fa
tigued that after she got Into bed she
did not notice the odor and was over
come. ' r.\
Peabody has not been told of the
death of his sister. He is now .being
cared for by neighbors who knew noth
ing of his illness until to-night.

The Following Seven Special Piano
Bargains Will Be Found of the
Greatest Possible Value to
Piano Buyers
Each of Which Is a Picked Sample, in Special
Fancy Design of Case, Shipped on
Here From the Factory,
>
With a View of Securing Our House as Repre-
sentatives for Same, and Are as Follows :
Three very fine "Needham & Sons" uprlg-hta, two of which are large cab-
inet cranda. In unusually fancy hand-carved casesâ one In curly French wal-
nut, tha other In fancy figrured mahoganyâ colonial Btyles, and are perfect
â¢amples of rare beauty. The "Needham" ranks among the few high grade,
etrictly first-class pianos, and Is one of the oldest and best known makes In
the country. These two- fine styles sell retail at 5550 each, but we shall offer
them to-morrow at $295, on terms of $26 down and J10 per month.
The other "Needham" is also an elaborate sample, not quite so large, pro-
- fosely hand-carved case of rich dark mahogany. Retails at $500. Offer it to-
morrow f ot $255, on same terms as the two above.
The fourth Is a "Reed & Eons," large, handsome cabinet grand, In a very
rarÂ« figure of dark curly walnutâ without carvingâ but Is unusually beauti-
ful la design of case and one of the finest toned pianos that stands In this
wareroom. The tone and action both are so satisfying that the performer Is
always loth to leave It, and if the high class and standing of the "Reed &
Sons'* were as well known here as they are In the East this piano, even at its
â¢ price cf $E50, would have been taken before this, for it stands" high in the"
scale of high grade pianos and east of the Rocky Mountains is handled only
as a leader. It is In. reality a very rare sample piano, and was shipped to us ,
to cell for and has been held at 5550, but it, along with the other samples,
oust be closed out at once, and will be put on sale to-morrow morning at
?2CS. which is its actual cost.
The buyer of this instrument will get more than $500 worth of piano, and
â¢ne of the best bargains that has ever been given out of this house. This
piano is a snap for any one who cares to go as high as 5300.
The fifth is a rarely beautiful cabinet grand "Krell" pianoâ a magnificent
exhibition style â in one of the most beautiful mahogany crotch
or mahogany byrl cases we have ever seen (varnish on up-
per panel slightly checked, hardly visible), fine quality of tone-
deep, yet clear and brilliant â "Wessell, Nickel & Gross" ac-
tion, light, rapid repeating. This piano is an exceedingly fine and rare sam-
ple of an exhibition "Krell," and would not be high at its regular retail price,
$690; but it may also go (on account of the slight checking on the muslo rack)
for $2S5, on payments of 525 down and 510 per month.
Another rare bargain In this sale of "seven specials" is a handsome,
large, cabinet grand "Conover." The Conover piano stands among the few
nationally known, "artistic," high-grade pianos of this country, is a very
costly make and Just as fine as it Is costly. This particular specimen is
their costliest styleâ cabinet gTand â in a rich, fancy figured mahogany case,
with hand-carved panels, fully in keeping with Its high-standard reputa-
tion.
This piano always sells for 5575, and is marked to sell for that now, but
being an elaborate and costly styie, has been In stock for some time and we
will call it slightly shopworn and offer It below its factory cost â consider-
ably below â $275; on terms of $25 down and $10 per month. This piano has to
be called shopworn, or something, in offering it publicly at such a price or
make a lifelong enemy of its manufacturer for offering It new at such a
scandalour figure, but it is worth its regular price of $575 just the same.
These above rarest of rare bargains are all brand new â factory guaran-
tee with each â and are offered at these merciless figures for the Bole pur-
pose of turning these splendid and costly samples into money and good pa-
pÂ»-r immediately and out of the way of our extensive new line of pianos now
on the way to take the place of the "Weber" and its kindred makes (the
Whec-lock and Stuyvesant) for which we no longer hold the agency.
We have about a dozen of these magnificent "Webers" yet to dispose of
and offer them at cost ($163 to $260 below their respective retail prices) and
â¢ ! on terms of $50 down and $15 per month, in order to close all of them out
within the next two or three daysâ and which places one of the finest and
most widely known pianos in the world within the reach of any who could
afford to pay as much as the retail price of an ordinary piano.
Have a fÂ«*w other fine makes to close out at once, ranging In price (cost
price) from $295 down to $106, on terms of $25 down and $10 per month.
Will close this sale within a few daysâ probably Wednesday-^and are mak-
ing the effort of our lives in the way of figures (there's nothing in It) to
turn everything in the way of a piano into proceeds at once.

Boat Could Xot Rise.
There is a thrilling story of the ad
venture of a French submarine " boat
while carrying out maneuvers recently
in the neighborhood of Havre. The
little vessel entered the estuary of the
Seine and proceeded some distance up
the river- Then an attempt was made
to bring It to the surface, but It failed
to rise. The fact that the specific grav
ity of fresh water was less than that
of sea water had been overlooked. For
twenty minutes efforts were made to
bring the boat to the surface, but with
out avail, and the position became more
serious when several of the crew grew
faint, owing to the foulness of the air.
To make matters worse the sub
marine. Instead of rising, showed signs
of settling on the river bed and becom
ing fixed there. The officer In com
mand, at length, perceiving the cause
of the trouble, made for the open sea
at full speed. All the while the men
who were suffering behaved admirably.
Shortly afterward they had the satis
faction of noting that ' thetr position
was improving, and that the boat was
gradually rising as they entered the
denser water, and finally they reached
the surface.
By this, time the crew were almost
overcome, but, with tha exception of
three, they quickly recovered on reach
ing the fresh air. The three In ques
tion were so ill that they had to be re
moved to a hospital.â Chicago News.

Louis N. Parker and W. W. Jacobs
Tell of Partnership Play
They Wrote,
LONDON, Dec. 10.â It Is not often
that playwrights come so successfully
through the ordeal of a dinner in their
honor as did W. "W. Jacobs and Louis
N. Parker, Joint authors of that de
lightful farce, "Beauty and the Barge,"
on the occasion of their recent enter
tainment by the Authors' Club. Par
ker took his oratorical Innings first.
"Collaboration, like poverty," he said,
"with which it has* much in common,
makes strange bedfellows." But In
this Instance the bedfellows had estab
lished a friendship which had survived
the test of prosperity and success.
"All the dramatic aspirant wants to
write a } successful play," said Jacobs,
"is a bottle of ink, a pen, some paper
andâ Louis Parker."
â  Their ' collaboration, according to his
whimsical description of it, had been
founded on tha firm hope that each
man would do all the work. In fact,
he deolared; they had "wasted months
writing encouraging letters to eaoh
other." i .

December Is Holding Up
the Record of Activity
for the .-Current Year
The December sales of local real es
tate, according to the most conserva
tive brokers, are reasonably sure to j
equal in number and in value repre- â 
eftnted those of December, 1903. The J
market is in fine shape. The movement ;
of purchasers toward the ocean, in the
Sunset and Richmond districts, contin
ues to be a maiked feature, as it is an
indication of the market.
The confidence of the people is very :
strong in the future, and signs of that |
fact are manifested by the busy aspect ]
of the real estate brokers' offices. New j
tracts in the suburbs are required to â¢
meet the demand for homes easy of j
access by electric roads. The move- 1
ment across the bay is large. Great i
cities are surely to exist on the east
shore. In Berkeley there is no cessa
tion of activity. The indications are
strong that the Key Route will soon |
reach the northern limits of Berkeley. I
Many flats in this city are still vacant,
but building is reasonably brisk and '
flats are included in the more recent j
contracts for construction work. !

COMBES' POWER
Defeat of Enemies of French
Premier on Spy Question
Makes Ministry Stronger
DUELLO IS RECOGNIZED
Government's Issuance of a
Permit to Fight Is Looked
on as Official Sanction
PARIS. Dec. 10.â Premier Combes and
his Cabinet have weathered another
etorm, the vote in the Chamber of Dep
uties yesterday evening having the ef
fect of making the Ministry stronger
than ever. This assures the carrying
out of M. Combes' programme, of
â which the principal feature is the sep
aration of church and state- The over
throw of tie programme has been the
real Issue, although the opposition
combined upon a number of ralnor
Questions whereon they were able* to
arouse popular sympathy.
The eystem by which the Gcvern
isent collects eecret Information con
cerning the private lives of army offi
cers and civil officials offered the best
means for attack. The opposition suc
ceeded In arousing intense popular
â¢ Citation, exceeding anything since the
Dreyfus case. The entire country took
sides for or against the practice and
eccres of duels were fought between
army officers. Judges. Deputies and of
flcia's. War Minister Andre's fall,
Deputy Syveton's tragic death and the
riots over the Joan of Arc incident
were part of the same manifestation-
It was believed that M. Combes
would be unable to resist the wave of
popular agitation, but the vote was ac
cepted as giving the Cabinet an ln
def.r.ite extension. It also shows the
growing stability of the French Cabi
net and its power to resist popular ex
citement.
The Government's Issuance of a permit
to M. Deroulede to enter France and
f.ght a duel with M. Jaures Is construed
as beir-s a formal official recognition
of duelling. Hitherto the practice has
rot been tolerated. Many unavailing
efforts have been made to pass pro
hibitory laws. The Socialists chiefly
opposed the practice, holding that
fencing is a relic of the pastimes of
the nobility, and therefore the action
cf the SociallFt leader, M. Jaures. In
challenging M. Deroulede indicates
that the chief opponents of dueling are
now resigned to accept the practice
as an established fixture.
M. Derou'.ede has written a sarcastic
tetter pointing: out the novelty of the
prC5er.ce of gendarmes in full uniform
as representing the Government's par
ticipation in the recent duel.

Tlic Old Biblical Term Suggests Good

Such remarkable changes can be
brougrht about by food properly se-

look to the rearrangement of a per-

"I wish to state a few facts which
will show you why there is and ever
will bÂ« in my heart a most grateful
appreciation of Grape-Xuts as a life-
giving., nerve - strengthening and
liealth-renorlng food.
My eldest son, William R., was
taken with a severe attack of scarlet
fever. This left him in a state of
uuch utter collapse and prostration of
nerve force and energy that he was
unable to sustain hia own weight.
"A complication of troubles fol-
lowed, the kidneys became affected,
nnd the doctors all declared his case
hopeless. \
"Naturally the stomacfywas too en-
feebled to retain or assifailate solid
food, and milk, beef tea. and the
like, soon became nauseating to him.
"Simply as an experiment a spoon-
ful of Grape-Nuts was suggested and
trlrd. Its predigested constituents
neemed to exactly suit my boy's case.
Eureka! We had indeed found IL
"'He not only retained the food, but
relished it and asked for more. From
that very day he began to mend, and
in three, weeks was convalescent.

Uricsol,
the only cure for
Rheumatism.
If you er,e suffering from rheuma-
tism there is a chance for yon to be-
come absolutely cured. You may
cure yourself and do it quickly if you
will lay aside your prejudice and
skepticism. .
Every San Francisco druggist sells
Uricsol, the well-known remedy, â  and
we hereby authorize them to guaran-
tee a cure.
Uricsol cures rheumatism in the only
possible way it can be cured.
Uric Acid and Urates are the cause
of Rheumatism. These- are deposited
in the tissues, blood vessels and joints
of the body;
These deposits must be -'dissolved
and eliminated from the system be-
fore a cure can be accomplished. â â \-
Uricsoi is a solvent of these and
tones up the system, the
kidneys, liver, ;.ndbowel& and thus
drives them from the system. .
Uricsol is harmless, and" no injuri-
ous results can possibly come to any

WEALTHIEST MEXICAN t
IS GEXERAIi TERRAZAS
Owner of Twenty Million Acres Will
Make Extended Visit to United
-'- -~\ r--w. â¢ 'States.
The wealthiest man In Mexico and
one of the wealthiest on the Ameri
can continent is General ' Luis Ter
razas, Governor of the state of Chi
huahua, which borders on the western
and southwestern parts of Texas. He
has Just been granted a four months'
leave of absence, and it is said that
he will make an extended visit to the
United States.
v The wealth of General Terrazas is
conservatively estimated. at 5150,000,
000 in gold, but It may be many mil
lions in excess ;,of that amount. Some
of those who. are in close touch with
his business and financial affairs . say
that 5200,000,000 Is nearer the correct
amount of his fortune." .
."General TerrazAs is; probably the
largest individual wand-owner in the
world. He owns in fee simple ap
proximately 20,000,000 acres* of land,
which is divided into fifteen haciendas
or ranches. No one, not even the gen
eral himself, knows the number of
cattle, he owns,' but it is roughly esti
mated that his herds
1.000,000 head, of which about 200,
000 are cows." He- also owns several
hundred thousand head of horses and
mules. ;"-â¢}'
1 An army j of, more than ten thou
sand men is kept constantly employed
on these ranches, and towns of several
thousand, population are .situated on
the lands. The ranches are well
-fencod.and one thousand boundary or
"fence-line" riders are kept constantly
employed,
â The land. and livestock holdings of
General, Terrazas form a comparative
ly small .part , of . his wealth. He
owns' more than five thousand resi
dences in the/city of Chihuahua, from
which he derives an enormous annual
rental. . He owns a" controlling interest
in all of the banks - and other finan
cial Institutions of the state of Chi
huahua, and has many million dollars
invested In manufacturing concerns in
that state.
Comparative Financial Stamina.
Russia may ' have greater 'financial
resources . than Japan, but she has
the greater , debt . France is plainly
weary of advancing '. money, and Ger
many is not likely to float, more than
'one,- loan. The r fact, that the war is
costing f Russia' $4 5, 000, 000^per month
while Japan is spending only" . one
third ; as much offsets Russia's * better
credit. .Moreover, Japan Js spending
70 per cent of her war funds at home,
while Russia Is spending nearly 70
' per J centvof < hers . abroad... . is v â¢. a
factor which" will tell "if is

WARBLES SONG FROM "CARMEN"
AS SHE WALLOPS CARPET.
DOLORES PAINA ROUSES
DUST AND PROTEST.
Edwin Bell Objects to Thuds and Is Arrested
BY JAMES C. CRAWFORD.
Chanting the bullfighters' chorus
from "Carmen" and walloping a car
pet in perfect rhythm with the rous
ing measure, Senora Dolores Patna
freighted the atmosphere aback of her
cottage 527% Vallejo street, with mel
ody and dust. One of her next door
neighbors, Edwin Bell by name, rel
ished the vocalism, but protested
against an accompaniment that cov
ered his household furniture and
filled the lunga of his family with fine
powder. Across the dividing fence he
addressed mild remonstrance to the
lady.
"Your warbling is all right," he
said; "indeed I have paid money and
fared worse. But that time beating
with the broomstick I consider both
inharmonious and unnecessary, as the
tune has sufficient swing to carry it
self without the aid of thuds. Just
cut out the carpet smiting and see
how much better the effect would be."
"Toe-ree-a-dore, toe-a-ree-a-dore,
la-lum, la-la-lum. la-la-lum-lee!" sang
Senora Paina, raising her tone pitch,
thumping the carpet with increased
vigor and absolutely ignoring both
critic and criticism.
Mr. Bell repeated his request in
voice of pronounced acidity, but the
iady pursued her vocal â¢ and physical
exercise as If he were not. Then he
abandoned suasion and resorted to. in
timidation, but not until his language
became thickly larded with profanity
did she look up and take notice. She
abruptly ceased both singing â¢ and
clouting the carpet long enough to
convince herself that his utterances
were really abusive, and then she had
him arrested for disturbing her peace.
The case had a brief inning yester
day before Police Judge Mogan and
much testimony is expected to be ven
tilated at the next hearing, set for
December 15.
With a view of turning an honest
penny toward himself while the em
bargo on gambling in Chinatown con
tinues, Ah Quong purchased a sec
ond-hand nickel-in-the-slot machine
and quietly informed his speculatively
inclined friends that he was ready
for business and proposed to pay his
losings with cash instead of cigars.
One of the vigilant members of the
recently revised police squad ferreted
out the gan\e, captured the machine
and arrested Ah Quong, who pleaded
ignorance of the law before Judge Ca
banLss and was fined S10.
Joe Johnson, piano polisher: Harry
Carter, piano tuner; C. H. Roth, piano
player, and J. Burley, piano mover,
were arrested for shooting craps at
7:45 o'clock p. m. last Friday in Lick
alley. Patrolmen Prole, Berg and
Springett testified that their attention
was attracted to the game by the dis
cordant noises made by the gamesters.
Whereupon the Judge of Department
No. 1 ruled that gentlemen whose
daily vocations pertained to the piano
forte could be excused for Indulging
in relaxative discord, but must be rep
rimanded for crap shooting. Repri
mand administered accordingly.
Miss Lulu Hamilton wanted to know
why Patrolman McGrayan had arrest
ed her and merely applied verbal re
buke to the two ladles by whom she
was accompanied on Pacific street.
"The town's come to a purty pass,"
said Miss Hamilton, "when a lady
can't walk along with her friends with
out being snapped up by the first po
liceman who happens to come along
and don't happen to like her. "If he
*ays I made all the noise he's mis
taken, for 1 was telling the story and
Violet and Gladys were laughing at it;
and I'd like to know how I coula make
most of the nojse when I was busy
talking. The idea of me being pinched
and the other two being let alone Is
what rasns me." " . ,
The officer explained that no dis
crimination was intended by him. He
arrested Miss Hamilton because she
insisted in talking in loud tones after
he had repeatedly requested -her to de
sist, while her. companions stuffed their
handkerchiefs into their mouths and
abstained from laughing after his first
intimation that their silence was desir
able. Furthermore, the defendant had
been notified by him on several previ
ous occasions that she must either curb
her penchant for delivering outdoor
orations or expect to be jailed.
"Did you ever hear the like of that?"
said Miss Hamilton to Judge Mogan.
"I wasn't making no speech, but tell
ing a story to Violet and Gladys. We're

Mine. Vera France, petite and viva
cious, displayed a purple bruise under
her left eye and averred that Robert
O'Smith, dapper and defiant, willfully
did it with his clenched right fist. He
was an esteemed lodger at her maison
on Mason street, she further explain
ed, until she surprised him In surrep-
tltious endeavor to remove his tn*ik.
He owed her money, but. deprivation
of ten times .the amount would not
grieve her as did his evident destitu

"Ah, heaven!" she exclaimed with
elevated eyebrows, clasped hands ana
despairing shoulder shrug:, "eet . ees

sired to get his personal belongings
out of Mme. France's house '/ere. he
notified her of his determination to ob
tain another abiding place. .Why? Oh,
Just because he Â» knew there would be
a scene when the lady was Informed
of his contemplated change of resi
dence. The fact was, if the court must
know it, his landlady had become too
tender in her attentions to him. and.
as he could not reciprocate in kind, he
felt that It was ; his duty as a man of
honor' to nee her presence. He had
lodged in her house about nine months
and throughout that period her at-.;
tachment to him waxed in Btrength
until It became an annoyance. : ' Even
when she discovered his attempt to
escape she implored him to remain
where he was, and when he sturdily

PEORIA, 111., Dec. 10. â A daring
bank robbery was committed in the
htart of the downtown district short
ly after 1 o'clock this afternoon, when
three men wearing slouch hats en
tered the. Peoria National Bank, and,
while two of the men covered Fred
erick A. Bracken with revolvers, the
third reached through the teller's win
dow and seizing about $500 in cur
rency and silver, made his escape.
The three men dashed out of the
building after threatening those In the
bank, and. leaping into a buggy stand
ing near, lashed the horse into a run.
The streets were crowded at the time
and a large crowd was immediately in
pursuit of the men. Their progress
was impeded by a crush of drays in
the wholesale district and they were
stopped for a. moment, by the crowd,
which had received word of the rob
b*ry.
A liberal display of revolvers fright
ened the crowd back and the robbers
turned and fled in another direction.
A big crowd took up the chase, includ
ing several automobiles, whose owners
managed to keep In sight of the men.
The men traveled rapidly and gained
on the crowd. They drove to the river
bank, where they abandoned their rig
and ran down the bank and disap
peared.

The hair I
of your head
The hair of the head is
far more sensitive to
climatic changes than is
usually supposed, and this
fact is peculiarly apparent
in California.
When the hair becomes
dry, brittle and falls out
and dandruff forms upon
the scalp it is an absolutely
certain indication of
diseased conditions, which,
unless promptly treated,
ivill result in baldness.
Coke Dandruff Cure is
the only remedy thus far
discovered which will not
only remove dandruff, but
will positively grow
new hair. *
That it will do so has
been proved by thousands.
._ It is a perfectly pure
liquid, free from even a
trace of sediment, sulphur
or any injurious ingredients
whatsoever.
tr It,is delightfully refresh- â¢
[ng, and under its benign
influence the hair quidkly - .. .
regains the softness and '
gloss of youth, and a new,
vigorous growth takes the
place of that which has been

Special Dltnatch to The Call.
LONDON, Dec. lO.-Admlsslon to the
theater at Bftyreuth will be free to all
after 1S13 If success attends an appeal
which is about to be made by the
Wasrner Associations of Germany. Wag
ner's hundredth anniversary occurs in
1913, and It Is hoped that by this time
$250,000 can be raised.' With ! this sum
In hand it will be possible to do away
with admission fees in connection with
the Bayreuth operas. In attempting
this the Wagnerites of the Fatherland
are endeavoring to carry but part of
tbe composer's own ambition, and they
consider this a more fitting means of
commemorating him than raising a
memorial of either stone of metal.
Shortly before his death "Wagner put
aside a sum of. money the Interest on
which was to be used in enabling -poor
persons of musical talents to travel. to
Bayreuth to witness his works given
at their best in his own theater, and it
was Wagner's intention to' enlarge this
fund so as to pay the * traveling and
hotel expenses of such persons, as well
&Â« free entrance to the theaterâ to es
tablish Bayreuth traveling scholar
ships, in fact. Of course, the Wagner
family will benefit In no way by the
fund whicn it is proposed to raise. They
do not now gain one penny from, the
representations at Bayreuth, as the en

AFFAIRS IN A BAD WAY
Executive Says a More Vig
orous and Strict Man Is
Needed in the Territory
; "WASHINGTON, Dec. 10.â Judga Ben
jamin S. Baker of New Mexico has
been .rembved by the President as the
result of a series of complaints" filed
with the President regarding affairs In
Bernalillo Qounty. The . following offi
cial statement of the case was given
out at the Department of Justice.to
day:' â  â  â¢ * '.
It was found that in Bernalillo'Coun
' ty, in which Albuquerque is situated,
political and official affairs generally
are In bad condition, that improper
Jury. Commissioners were being ap
pointed, that the selection of JurorB
was tampered with, the Sunday law
was not enforced against gambling and
saloons and that Judge Baker was not
doing what a Judge should do to rem
edy the evils. It was considered that a
. more vigorous and strict Judge wa*
imperatively needed in his place. |
It was for these reasons that change
in the , judgeship was decided upon,
and not because Judge Baker was
deemed dishonest or corrupt.
Etchegaria, at Cambo, and the drama
tist's chief recreation is motoring in the
vicinity. Madame Rostand is with him.
She also Is literary 'and published a
volume of verse not long ago called
"Les Pipeaux." The Rostands have two
little boys, Maurice and Jean.
It will be rather Interesting to gee
what effect Olga Nethersole and Mrs.
Craigle's recent "appeal to Caesar"
will have on "The Flute of Pan." Thus
far the developments since the mem
orable first night have been both edify
ing and amusing.
SCHEME OF AUTHORESS.
A day or two after her play was
"booed" Mrs. Craigle wrote a long let
ter to one of the Pearson newspapers,
in which, after discussing the ethics of
"booing" at much length, the astute
authoress declared that she and Miss
Nethersole were prepared to give one
free performance of their piece at the
Shafte8bury In order to get an unbiased
verdict as to Its merits. The newspaper
was to allot seats to the public, and by
this means a representative audience
would be obtained. Accordingly the
Journal invited applications for places
in the theater on a certain night, and
the results were truly amazing â more
than 235,000 people asking for admis
sion. Whereupon a delightful Inter
view with Miss Nethersole made Its ap
pearance, in which the. actress declared
that the rush for seats was Indisputable
evidence to her of British love for fair
play. Perhaps free play would have
been nearer the mark. However, of the
actress' "two hundred thousand
friends," ., as she called them, only 1230
could be' accommodated with seats, and
before this audience "The' Flute of
Pan" was given with great .eclat. A
voteâ by ballotâ as to Its merits was
taken, too. whenby a majority of 1200
to SO the piece was" declared a worthy
one, to "boo" which were a profana
tion. Whether the thousands who ap
plied for seats and 'didn't, get them will
turn. up at the bok-bmce "remains, how
ever, to be seen. â¢ \ *

"For twenty .years I suffered with

DISCUSS WORK
OF LIBRARIANS
Members of California As
sociation Enjoy Banquet
and Interesting: Addresses
BIG PLAN OF THE STATE
Trustee Explains How : the
Blind in -Interior Will
Be Supplied. With Books
The story of the good work that is
being accomplished by the libraries of
the State,' was told last evening. at; the
annual dinner of the Library Associa
tion of California, held at the Occi
dental Hotel. More than, a hundred
members of the association enjoyed
the feast and the addresses, all of
which- were confined to the purposes of
the association and the problems that
confront its members.
The banqueters were seated at two
tables artistically-decorated .with, ferns
and flowers. Down the center of each
table a blanket of ferns was laid and
over it cut blossoms were showered in
profusion. Though rich, red wine was
In evidence, the gentlemen let this mild
indulpepee suffice, and no cigars were
lighted to lend enjoyment to them and,
incidentally, discomfort to the ladles. '
At the head table were seated, the
officers of the associationâ Joy Lichten
stein, president: Bertha Kumli, vice
president; Margaret A. Schmidt, secre
tary, and Florence B. Whlttier. treas
urer. . llr. "Whlttier. was- one of the
speakers. To the right and left of the
officers sat the other speakers->J. C.
Rowell, Charles S. Greene, trustee of
the State Library; Melvin C. Dodge,
George C Clark, Frederick J. Teg
gart and Emily L Wade. David Starr
Jordan, president of Stanford Univer
sity, wan* also listed among the speak
ers, but he was unavoidably absent.
NO MORE SURPLUS OP FUNDS.
Charles S. Greene delivered the, most
interesting address of the evening, his
position as trustee of the State Library
giving him knowledge of facts all the
members of the association were anx
ious to learn. Mr. Greene said that
though In the past there had usually
been a curplus in the library funds at
the end of each year he and his as
sociates -would see that it did not oc
cur again, as they were confident that
more good would come to the State
through the proper expenditure of
funds for library purposes than in per
mitting them to lie Idle, where they
draw no Interest. â¢ ' ,
lie said seventy-flvo traveling li
braries were enriching the intellect of
the State, being sent from place to
place to meet the requirements of those
thaf dwe.ll where no public library Is
available. â  It â¢ would bo but a ' few
months, he continued, when there
would be a hundred such libraries in
circulation, and the. increased expense
in maintaining them would provide
good use for the surplus In the hand3
of tho trustees. ' . '^
BLIND WILL BE CARED FOR.
â¢Another great work that was to be
accomplished, he said, was to . place
raised-letter books in the hands of
blind persons in : the interlpr. of . the
State who were unable to take .ad
vantage of the libraries at the public
and private institutions established for
unfortunates; thus afflicted. - The im
portance of this work could not \ -be
overestimated, he. concluded, because
these ' books would renew hope â¢' again
in the hearts of those; now groping in
darkness. : - ~ '. : /
The other speakers dwelt upon the
general, work before the. librarians of
the. State, and, .though much of their
information was technical, it. was;. not
devoid of interest, , even to the layman.
At the conclusion of the addresses
President Llchtenstein ; said ,; that,
though it had 'been the .purpose of the
association to elect new officers at the
time of the annual dinner, the election
would be- postponed, In order that the
enjoyment of the feast might not be
interfered with In the discussion of
the merits of various candidates. This
announcement was â¢ approved by all,
and so until midnight the good time
continued. "i'rv\ : . ' '

POHEIMIIAS AMBITIONS
Wants Place on Police Board.
David J. Oliver, Jr. Is
Sure of Good Appointment
Frank P. Flint and his angels of the
southland 'are in San Francisco mix
ing- with' the statesmen of the metropo
lis. George A. Knight has gone to Men
dpcino County, leaving Senator. Rals
ton at the court of the Palace to keep
an eye on Flint's angelic host.
The statesmen are wondering why
Governor Pardee does not. unlock the
pent-up, patrtmage. The appointment
of a' Prison Director to succeed R. M.
Fitzgerald is long overdue. Across the
bay in.'Marin County .there Is a deal of
talk concerning the successor of J. H.
Wilkins on the board. â¢ It is common
gossip that J. H. Prj'br of the Sausa-.
lito News wiir be appointed to the di
rectory. Custom gives Marln, the
county, in which one of- the prisons is
located, a representative In the board.
The custom of appointing a" newspaper
man will be further honored by the Be
lection of Mr. Pryor to succeed Editor
Wilkins.
The lawyers maintain that the nine
Appellate Judges should: be' appointed
forthwith, but the Governor,.it is said,
will not permit the clamorous attorneys
to goad him into a rush. I
The forecast" of probable appoint
ments to the" vacancies on the various
municipal commissions on January 8
which' was - published in yesterday's
Call furnished an . interesting topic of
discussion among politicians 'and city
officials throughout the day.
The name of David J. Oliver Jr. was
Inadvertently omitted in the list of
probable, appointees. Oliver has re
ceived assurances that he will be put
on one | of .the.; commissions. . He was
once a strong candidate for member of
the Board of Education, but School Di
rector. Altmann's reappointment pre
cludes Oliver's selection : for that post.
Oliver will probably be placated with
the appointment' on the. Civil Service
Commission, to- succeed Commissioner
John who has his eye on some
Federal appointment that" he hopes to
receive through Congressman-elect
Hayes. . . â¢
It is stated on good authority that
Dr. Joseph Poheim, present member of
the Board of Health; is ambitious to
become Pollde Commissioner, . to- suc
ceed ' Howell. , Thus the situation re
garding â¢. that appointment' becomes
complicated.. Dr. George Drucker
stands well with the administration
and. he also aspires. to t the Police Com
misslonershlp. It is on this office that
the bitterest flght will . be , made, and

THE VAI.UE OP CHARCOAIi.
Few Peoi.Ij Know How Useful It Is in
'-. z iPrcser\1ns Health and .Beauty.
.â¢Nearly everybody knows that char T
coal, is . the f safest t and most \ efficient
disinfectant and â¢ purifier ' in nature,
but -few realize its' value when taken
into the human system for the same
cleansing purpose.
Charcoal is a remedy that the more
you take of It the better; it is not a
drug"-at all,, but; simply absorbs the
gases and Impurities , always .present
in the stomach and intestines and car-
ries them", out of the system.
Charcoal sweetens the breath after
smoking, drinking or after eating on-
ions and other odorous vegetables.
Charcoal effectually clears and im-
proves the complexion; It whitens the
teeth and further, acts as a natural
and eminently safe cathartic.
It absorbs the injurious gases which
collect in the stomach and bowels; it
disinfects the mouth and throat from
the poison. of catarrh.
; All ' druggists' sell charcoal In one
form ' or another, but probably â¢ the
best charcoal and' the "most for the
money is' in 'Stuart's ; Charcoal Lozen-
ges ; they" are composed t of the finest
powdered* Willow 'charcoal 'and' other
harmless antiseptics in tablet form,
or rather In the form of large,' pleas-
ant tasting lozenges, the charcoal be-
ing mixed with honey.
The'daily use of these lozenges will
soon tell in" a much j Improved condi-
tion of the general health, better com-
plexion, sweeter breath and"; purer
blood, and the beauty of it is that : no
possible harm can 'result from;. their
continued use, but, ; on ; the contrary,
great- benefits
A" Buffalo physician, in speaking of
the benefits .of charcoal, says: "I advise
Stuart's' Charcoal Lozenges to. all pa-
tients suffering â  f rdnT gas . in stomach
and' bowels arid' to "clear the: complex-
ion and. purify ; the .breath, mouth and
throat;.-, I: also .believe the "liver is
greatly, benefited by the daily, use of
them; they, costbut. 25 cents a box -at
drug stores and although ' in some
sense a patent preparation, yet I be-
lieve' I getmore and better' charcoal
in Stuart's Charcoal Lozenges than in
any of the ordinary. charcoal tablets."
other candidates, are sure to loom up,
with more or less chance of success.
Should Poheim .become Police
missioner there will be another vacan
cy on the Health Board in addition to
the one created by Dr. Stinson's resig-.
nation. As already stated in these col
umns, Dr. Jules Simon appears to have
the best chance fdr Stinson's place.

COLLEGE FARM
IN CALIFORNIA
Legislature Will Be Asked
. to Appropriate Money for
an Agriculture School
LAEGE TBACT OF LAND
Results Achieved in Middle
West Claim the Attention
of Leading Farmers Here
Gratifying results achieved in Iowa,
Minnesota, Illinois and Wisconsin
through the agency of State agricul
tural colleges have been closely in
vestigated by leading men of Califor
nia. Figures showing probable vast
Increase in the products of the soil
and the addition of many millions of
dollars to the taxable wealth of the
State will be presented to the Legisla
ture at Sacramento in support of a
measure for the establishment of an
agricultural school in California. The
advocates of the college enterprise
.maintain that intelligent cultivation
of the soil will do more than all othÂ«r
measures combined to promote the
prosperity of this State. The main
idea is to render farming so interest
ing and remunerative that young men
â¢will cultivate the land rather than
flock to the city in pursuit of clerical
positions and other wage earning em
ployment.
LIVESTOCK MEN MEET.
At the Palace Hotel yesterday after
noon there was a meeting of the Livo
etock Breeders* Association of the
State. The directors attending were
Charles B. Pierce, president; Judge
Peter J. Shields, General W. R. Shat
ter, William Pearce, A. B. Evans, J.
H. Glide. I. Bird and E. W. Major,
secretary. The main discussion of the
cession was on the provisions of a
bill to establish an agricultural .col
lege in California . or toy purchase a
large farm for the agricultural de
partment of the State University. The
amount of money required was not
definitely agreed upon. Earnest ad
vocates of the measure, viewing what
has been accomplished in the Middle
West, favored an allowance of $500,
000. â  â  .
The bill which was under reviev
yesterday does not designate any lo
cality for the farm. The site will lÂ»e
chosen by a commission consisting of
the Governor, Lieutenant Governor,
president of the State University.
Chief Justice of the Supreme Court
and the president of the State Bonr-i
of Agriculture. It is noted that four
of the proposed commission Â«re re
gents of the university; 'It'ts proba
ble that a farm quite distant from
Berkeley will be chosen. Experience
has demonstrated that boys are not
inclined to pursue agricultural studies
where other departments of study en
roll the vast majority of students.
LARGE FARM REQUIRED.
Eastern experts who have looked
over the field recommend the pur
chase of 1000 acres for a farm. It is
claimed that the investment will ba
at once remunerative to the Stats.
Statistics are produced to show that
the college in Illinois last year added
515,000,000 to the wealth of the Stat*.
Livestock men will endeavor to con
vince the legislators at Sacramentu
that vast gains will immediately fol
low the application of intelligent
methods in rarming and stock raising
For example, it Is said that the cows
In California produce only an average
per cow of 110 pounds of butter an
nually. Proper attention to breeding
would double the product of butter
without increasing the number of
cows.
The men who are foremost In ad
vocating the establishment of the'col
lege entertain the belief that Gover
nor Pardee is in hearty sympathy with
them in efforts to advance the cause
of farming. The late Walter S. M*
lick was an enthusiast in the support
of the proposed measure. HÂ« saw
possibilities of great good to th*> State.
Many of his impressions were com
municated to Judge Shields.

NEW LIFEBOAT IS TRIED WITH
NOTEWORTHY SUCCESS.
Craft That Cannot Capsize op Sink
I â¢ VIEWS OF A COLLATSIBLE LIFEBOAT WHILE IT WAS UNDERGOING PUBLIC
TEST YESTERDAY OFF THE OCEANIC STEAMSHIP COMPANY'S DOCK.
THE LITTLE VESSEL PROVED A MARVEL. ,
A lifeboat designed to prevent a
repetition of the great sea tragedies of
the Rio de Janeiro-, the Bourgogne and a
thousand others -was publicly tested off
the Oceanic Steamship Company's dock
yesterday at noon and filled every ex
pectation. The device is known as the
Engelhardt Collapsible Lifeboat and is
described by its manufacturers as fol
lows: , -
"It is a compact, strong and< ab
solutely safe lifeboat which can be col
lapsed or folded into one-third of the
space occupied by. an ordinary boat of
the same dimensions. It is â  so con
structed that its carrying capacity, for
the stowage space required, is far
greater than that of any ether lifeboat
in existence. The operation of extend
ing it is simple and takes only, a few
seconds.
"This boat makes it possible for pas
senger steamers to carry ample and ef
ficient lifeboat accommodations for the
total number of perso-ns aboard. It is
constructed entirely of buoyant mate
rial and a twenty-foot boat, even when
filled with water, will sustain 'over -4000
pounds and a twenty-six-foot boat ovfer
SOUO pounds. Its great buoyancy is due
to the fact that its bottom and fender
are filled with kapoc, a material deter
mined by the German naval tests to
have seven and one-hair times the
buoyancy of cork.
'ALMOST INDESTRUCTIBLE.
"It would be serviceable, even with
its sides torn, its plugs lost, its bottom
crushed. Every boat carried, no mat
ter how badly damaged,* would .be
available in case of accident. Being
less than a foot In, depth 'when folded,
it can be easily, stowed, and a heavy
sea would not be nearly so likely to in
jure it or'carry.it away as an ordinary
lifeboat. â¢ It is always ready. â  Should
the vessel-sink suddenly, it would' float
as a raft, and still support its full com
plement of passengers. -. It can always
be launched, wherever on deck it may
have been stowed. If the ship is rolling
badly, a few men can without difficulty
carry - the boat from windward to ' lee
ward. If the davits , are jammed, it
may be thrown overboard bodily, and
be manned and extended later while In
the water. * Its ' construction ' is ~ such
that It cannot capsize, 'even if all the
passengers it will hold are crowded
against one rail."
These are the claims of its builders
and, > considering the conditions, â they
were well sustained , by yesterday's
test, which was under, the direction of
Captain' J. . Barneson, . who represents
the manufacturers. on! this coast, Of
course it was much like';testing a ma-*
chine : gun in'tlme of peace. The* storm
was riot there, "nor, was .the terrorjand

parent that even had these conditions
prevailed â  more "of ' these "â  boats ' - could

PRAISE FRO31'BOIiIiES...
The boat r used; yesterday . ; was â : 'only
sixteen \ feet < long,-, and sixteen seamen,
representing a probable weight- of 3000
pounds, crowded into It and piled them
selves, first; against* one rail and then
against the'other.. She Proved 'as "stiff"
as a steam*, schooner and was pro
nounced by.!, all ' a remarkable -" boat.
SAN" FRANCISCO, : SUNDAY; " DECEMBER li;, 1904.
Inspectors of Hulls and Boilers Bolles
and Bulger witnessed the test. When
It was over Mr. Bolles said:
"It Is really a llferaft, having all the
stability of that craft, but when ex
tended it looks like a boat. For long
distance traveling it wpuld" not 1 - be j a
success, but for. its purpose, .that of
saving life, I know of no device that I
think isits equal." â  ;
.His. views were shared.by . all . that
witnessed the test and among the on
lookers were several' steamship men
who are vitally Interesfed in the safety
of the thousands that yearly voyage
across the seas.

T. P. Andrews Is Foreman
. Two capitalists, tfo clerks, a book
keeper.; a publisher and the remainder
merchants constitute the businesslike
Grand Jury drawn yesterday morning
in. Judge Kerrigan's court by
Clerk John Greif. It would- not, have
been possible to get nineteen to serve
out of the list of thirty-one drawn from
the Grand Jury box last Wednesday
had not two men waived their claims
to exemption and Judge Kerrigan re
jected the excuse offered by a third.'
George A. Newhall, president of the
Chamber of Commerce, was one of the
reluctant 'ones." He said that he had
been a member of the Police Commis
sion, was always treated courteously
by the administration and did notcare
to sit in judgment upon it Judge Ker
rigan told him to serve. W. G. Staf
ford, president of the fuel company
bearing his name, is a United States
trial juror and had a valid excuse, but
said that he was willing to sit on this
body if it intended to do effective work.
Judge Kerrigan thought that the Jury
would be effective, and Mr. Stafford
withdrew his excuse. J. T. Sullivan
had been a trial jurordn Judge Law
lor's court and was therefore' exempt.
He had. left the courtroom when Clerk
Riley and Bailiff Duffy went In "pur
suit of him and persuaded him to re
turn. The Judge told him : that the
jury could not be filled'unless he with
drew his excuse, and Mr. Sullivan con
sented to serve. - <

.."Judging from the figures obtained in
the last census California Is not pro
ducing nearly the amount of pork that
other .States do, â¢ excepting perhaps
those that are used. almost entirely for
range purposes. We .find at the same
tlme\that we are shipping into the
State a large amounttof pork. Most of
it comes In â¢. the shape of salted hams
and sides. The Philippine 'trade has In
creased .wonderfully during the last
four or nye years, aqd there is no doubt
that our -Eastern .possessions will offer
large 'markets to us in the future. The
reason .why California has not gone
more extensively into hog-ralsing may
be found 'in; the fact that in .the 'opinion
of ' most' people corn and hogs' must \ go
together." v . . - â¢ ; . â¢

ARCHBISHOP DEDICATES A
HOME FOR GIRLS.
Catholic Ladies Finish Task
JSOMK i'ROMIKEXT MEMBERS OF THE CATHOLIC LADIES' AID SOCIETY AND |
THE DISTINGUISHED PRELATE WHO DEDICATED THE HOME FOR \
/ GIRLS WHICH HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED BY THAT ORGANIZATION.
The Catholic Ladles' Aid Society's
Girls' Home was dedicated yesterday
by Archbishop P. W. Rlordan In the
presence of several hundred women,
who were Jubilant that their years of
zealous effort had at last borne the
fruit of success. The home Is at 1205
Go'ugh " street,, and in the three flats
that have been combined accommoda
tions are provided for forty young
women who from force of circum
stances must earn their' own livelihood.
The j institution is not eleemosynary or
reformatory in character, but is aimed
to give the advantages and comforts
of home life at the -very lowest rates
insuring sustenance of the home. It is
particularly desired to help girls whose
Incomes are small. 1839
: The â  house will be ready for occur
pancy in a week or ten days, and many
applications have already been re
ceived. Yesterday it was thrown open
for. inspection.' The two upper floors
are to be used exclusively for bedrooms
and. on the first floor will be the kitch
en, the dining-room, the office and a
large dpuble-room that will be used by
the young women as a reading and so
cial room. Miss Truett, who has had
much experience in conducting such In
stitutions ' and- has been thoroughly
tested in the tact that is required, has
been engaged to take charge.
SUCCESS AT LAST.
â â - It is seldom that women are attracted
with greater enthusiasm to a work than
has been in the cases of those members
of the Ladles' .Aid. Society, who have
been striving for: years to. open a home
for. young working women. The great
good that has been accomplished in
Eastern cities in alleviating the harsh
conditions that meager. wages Impose,
and the work of Improving the condi
tions of moral and physical welfare
had flred* . the local ._â  Catholic women
with the laudable purpose bf establish
ing such, an institution in San Fran
cisco.. The'BOCieties throughout Califor
nia" joined in the movement,' but prog
ress ' was slow in ' collecting the funds
required.. There was much discourage
ment, but with' Indefatigable zeal en
tertainments , and "at homes" were
given and money raised in every way
that could be resorted to. Now t that
success has * crowned ; their . eff ortaVthere
is much cause for gratification/ T "'
...The following are some of the women
whose determlnation'to'succeed'and to
help hpmeless andstrivlng girls > has re
sulted in founding the home: 1 Mrs. Mar
garet Deane, Miss Mary Carr, Mrs.
Mary. Collins, , Miss * Mary Conlan, Mrs.

,-.. Archbishop f Rlordan spoke briefly of
the, tendency of young people to, leave
the Country ; to" enter ' what appeared to
be the attractive field of the cities, with
Pages 39 to 50
the result that in the crowdins and
strenuosity of the city moral and phy
sical well-being suffer. Such institu
tions at theGlrl3'Home help to counter
act the evil Influences that operate so
strongly. The Archbishop spoke the rit
ual of the dedication and the home was
placed under the patronage of St. Mar
garet.
Rev. Father Wyman felicitated" thÂ»
women of the Aid Society on their suc
cess, pointing out that the home waj
not a part of the religious organization
and that it is non-sectarian strictly.
A musical programme then followed,
and those who took part were Mlsa
Charlotte Pau. Miss Myrtle Mellet. Miss
M. Walsh, Miss Ethel Grazier, Miss
Marie Giorglanl and Mrs. M. F. Bren
nan.
In the evening another reception was
held and the following programme waV
rendered: Soprano solo. -Mrs. M. Mc-

BRITT KEEPS
UP GOOD WORK
Sparring Partners Come In
for Fast Time When^ Jim
my Begins to Cut Loose
THE "SPIDER" PRESENT
Mr. Kelly Looks On While
the Plumber Boy Roughs
It in Various Clinches
Jlmmy Britt did not have an Or
pheum audience gazing on him with
admiration yeeterday, but. he worked
harder than he has ever labored on
anybody's stage. The select few who
were admitted within the Inner circle
of the exclusive gymnasium at the Seal
Rock House marveled as the plumber
boy banged and pounded away at his
sparring partners and gave rough
usage to the apparatus about the place.
Jimmy is becoming more at home at
the beach as the days flit merrily by.
"The man who started that bugaboo
about putting on weight out here is
crazy," says James. "Why, I can take
off as much as I like, but I am in no
hurry about that. That is the least
of my troubles. I will be better and
stronger this time than I ever was in
my life before."
The morning sprints through the
park are becoming- one of the joys
of Mr. Brltt's life now. He skims o^er
the ground like a colt and feels fresher
and stronger after each run than when
he started out. Then the plunge into
the broad Pacific acts as a tonic and
makes him feel like pummeling a dozen
men when he enters the gymnasium
for his strenuous work of the afternoon.
After a few preliminary whacks at
tha bag Frank Rafael was called out
to take his usual beating. Britt was
on his toes from the moment the first
round commenced, and during the four
periods he kept after his man without
letting up for an instant. He played
almost continually for the body and
paid particular attention to whipping
that right hand In at every opportun
ity.
"Spider" Kelly was on the scene to
administer a few words of advice and
tell Jimmy what was best to do. The
Spider could hardly conceal his emo
tions when the pace waxed fast and
he was shouting orders and going
through several kinds of gestures from
the side lines. At the end of the fourth
spasm Rafael was fagged out. for he
had come in for some rough usage and
had little time to recuperate.
One long round of wrestling and tug
ging In the clinches with "Tiv" Krel-
Ing was next served to the spectators.
Britt is playing this game all the time
now, and the pace increases each day. '
He wants to be prepared for Mr. Nel
son and his unrelenting ways in the
clinches, and figures that there is no
better way to make ready than to en
gage Kreling in such a bout every da>.
When his afternoon's work was at an
end Britt topped it off with another
plunge. He looks better each day, ano.
If he does hot overtrain should appear
at his Dest when he faces Nelson. He
will not take a day off to-day, though
It is Sunday. A large crowd is ex
pected. â¢< . . . . '.*-/--.-
Britt posted his $2000 forfeit yester
day with Harry Corbett, the stake
holder. One thousand dollars of this
guarantees that he will be on hand at
the appointed hour and the remaining
thousand that he will make 182 pounds,
the stipulated weight.
Contrary to expectations, Battling
Nelson buckled down to hard work
yesterday at his training" quarters at
Smiling Metzner's tavern. Larkspur.
It was programmed for Nelson to take
affairs easily until next week, but the
Dane became restless and went to
work with a will. In the evening after
a brisk rubdown Bat tipped the
scales at 134 pounds after his strenu
ous day. Bat was out â  on the road
early in the morning and took a spin
over the hills to Mill Valley. He re
turned looking as fresh as a daisy.
In the afternoon he spent an hour, in
the gymnasium punching the bag,
throwing the medicine ball and pull-
Ing the weights. Four fast rounds
with Eddie Santry completed the day's
work.
SOLDIERS PLAY A TIE

Kickers of Post Engage Twenty-First
Infantry Team In a Score
less StniKEle.
The football game between the* Pre
sidio post team and the team of the
Twenty-first Infantry at the Presidio
athletic grounds yesterday resulted in
neither side scoring. The game was
a fast one. The Twenty-first got the
kick-off and practically had the ad
vantage during both halves. Fumbles
on both sides were frequent.
In the second half the Twenty-first
Infantry had the ball twice within ten
yards of the goal and at this point
lost it. ...
The quarterback playing on both
sides was good and the interference
first-class.
Captain John B. , Schoeffel, Tenth
Infantry, was umpire; Dr. Thomas
Jefferson Strong was referee and Cap
tain George P. White was timekeeper.
About 1000 people were* in attend
ance, the majority being officers and
their families and enlisted men from
the PreFldio.

Fossil, the fame little brown gelding,
with is old side, . partner "Big Bill"
Knapp in the saddle, captured the
Family Club handicap' at Oakland yes
terday front a field of six other start
ers. Besides the $885 which' went to the
first horse from the "j 51000 stake, 'the
owners of Fossil, Parker 1 & Thwaites,
received the magnificent silver -cup
presented by the Family Club, of this
city. , â  -'. ' .:
The stable of Walter Jennings re
ceived full" representation, for that
owner started three in the race â Gold
Money, carrying top weight, 116, Vesu
vlan and Arcade.. The entry was, of
course, favorite at odds of 3 to 2. Fos
sil, allotted 113 pounds, did not appear
to be In great demand, for his odds re
ceded from 2(*to 5 to 1. Military Man
and Bombardier, each quoted at 18 to
5 around post time, were accorded
steady support.
There is little to describe about the
race. Away fifth from the barrier,
Knapp took Fossil out in front, and
though brought to a hard drive as the
wire was approached by Helgesen on
Military Man, won by a neck.
Arcade easily disposed of Bombardier
for the small end of the purse. Vesu
vian, the runner-up for a' long way,
finally had to fall back. Gold Money,
piloted by Dominlck and the main reli
ance of the Jennings stable, got cut off
early and was not a .factor in the run
ning thereafter.
ATTENDANCE- IS LARGE.
The' attendance was large, mem
bers of the Family Club being con
spicuous by their yellow badges.bear
ing the words "The Family" printed
in black, the combination being the
colors of the Jockey Club. Perfect
weather conditions prevailed. The
tradk was slow and in places heavy.
Favorites had an awful time endeav
oring to reach .the wire first, Sad
Sam .of the entire assortment meeting
with success. The longest priced
winner of the afternoon was Inspec
tor Munro.
Inspector Munro was some time in
making good, but finally turned the
trick in the opening' seven-furlong
selling affair. A 16 to 1 shot, Frank
Sullivan brought him from ninth po
sition and then won almost easily
from Meistersinger. , Louis Ezell's
Trapsetter, backed from 25 to 10, only
lost the place by a nose. ; Budd Wade,
the favorite, under * Helgesen's brisk
riding, kept up well to the stretch,
where he faltered,* running fourth.
Billy Cahlll's Odd Fellow colt Yada.
with Davis in the saddle, Is "now a
full fledged member of society, for hs
defeated both Sea Air and Hooligan
in the puree event for two-year-olds.
Sea Air,- having Knapp as pilot, was
made favorite at 8 to 2. Hooligan had
second cdll, while C could be obtained
about Yada. It is possible that , the
favorite was best, for Knapp permit
ted his mount to be carried into the
poor going on the far turn and then
lost the rctee by less than a length.
Hooligan finished thlrd,,beaten a neck
for the place.
SAD SAM IS GREAT FORM.
Sad Sam ran circles/around his field
in the Futurity course selling fixture.
Ridden by Sherwood and an even
money favorite, he skimmed along
out in front and was only galloping at
the end, five lengths before Stilicho
and Sir Preston. Redan had some
early speed, though failing to carry
it far. % V.S
Neither Red Cross Nurse, the favor
ite, nor The Lieutenant, second choice,
gathered any. moss in the seven'fur
long selling run. fifth to.be decided.
While back, in the bunch the latter
fell with Michaels. Red Cross Nurse,
after being cut off near the half-mile
pole, never had a chance. Minder put
up a vigorous ride oh the 10 to 1 out
sider Mountebank, which outstayed
Mimo and scored by " 3eks- Chan -"â¢ a
length. â¢ Tom Ryan's Flaunt ran i a
bang-up third.

ON GUN THIEF
George In^ersoll Tries to
Sell a Stolen Weapon
and Meets With Surprise
OFFERS IT TO OWNER
Harry Strock Lends the
Article to Charles Calson
and Third Man Steals It
George W. Ingersoll was the victim
of peculiar circumstances yesterday
which landed him in the City Prison
on a charge of petty larceny. After
stealing a shotgun he was uncon
sciously directed back to tha owner
of the firearm for the purpose of mak
ing a sale, where a policeman took him
In charge. The story of the theft and
effort to realize on the stolen prop
erty ia Interesting.
Early yesterday afternoon Charles
Calson of 69 Vermont street resolved
to go hunting to-day. He had no gun.
but remembered that his friend, Harry
Strock, a saloon-keeper at 660 Fourth
street, had one. When Calson asked
for the loan of the firearm Strock
readily complied and Calson .started
off with the weapon in tho direction
of his home. On the way he was ac
costed by Inersoll. who asked permis
sion to relieve Calson of tho weight
of the gun. Calson consented, but
when he reached his gate he observed
that Ingersoll and the gun were dis
appearing In an opposite direction.
Unable to capture the thief. Calson
reported the matter to the police.
Last night Ingersoll took the gun
to a saloonman at the corner of Third
and Townsend streets and offered It
for sale. This saloonman was not a
sportsman and suggested that a visit
be made to his friend Harry Strock
on Fourth street, where the weapon
might be disposed of. When Inger
soll arrived at Strock's place the pro*
prietor recognized his property and
called In Policeman Frank Fontana.
Calson was then sent for and tha
charge of petty larceny made.

CORRIGAX GOES EAST
TO PLEAD HIS CAUSE
Master of Hawthorne Is Anxious to
Form an Alliance With the
Jockey Club.
CHICAGO, Dec. 10.â Ed Corrigan.
master of Hawthorne, left to-day for
New York. When asked if he was to
meet the governing body of the Jockey
Club and form an alliance with the
eastern organization, Corrigan refused
to make specific reply, but left the im
pression that that was his mission. It
is learned from an authoritative source
that Corrigan will form in the interest
of track owners who have been forced
to secede from the Western Jockey
Club an alliance, offensive and defen
sive, with the New York Jockey Club,
the strongest turf organization in
America. By this alliance the dissatis
fied westerners expect to operate under
licenses granted by the eastern associa
tion. There is to be a meeting here
of all interests Involved in tracks
turned down by the last meeting of the
Western Jockey Club immediately af
ter the return of Corrigan from the
East.
Race track men are discussing the
chances of disgruntled trackmen
throughout the country who are said to
be heading a movement to petition the
Western Jockey Club for a.readjust
ment of dates recently allotted by that
organization at the annual meeting.
The report that Louisville. Cincinnati,
Memphis and the New Orleans, St.
Louis and Hot Springs tracks would
make request for what they consider a
more equitable allotment, according to
those who are on the inside, is said to
have sprung from a number of turf
men who are anxious to make trouble
for the Western Jockey Club and start
an organization on a' new footing with
what they consider a more representa
tive body of men as stewards. Martin
Nathanson, secretary of Harlem, in
discussing the situation said that the
action of the Western Jockey Club at
the last meeting was final and that un
less some unforeseen Incident made it
necessary there would be no change.
Ed. Wagner said Worth track was
entirely satisfied -with its â¢ allotment
and, as far as he had heard, there was
no movement among the track owners
to ask for a readjustment of dates.

* " / WWJBKr Wvf - â¢" more for a man's health than they do for his dollars â but most of
them call me a quack because I p ay for my advertising. But they
all admit that electricity will increase strength. That is all I claim for it. That's all you want, any way. If you have enough strength you'll never be
weak, nor suffer a pain.
It used to be considered sensible to take drugs to "wake up" sluggish circulation, to stimulate weak nerves, to make the stomach take food
that it was too weak to digest, and then another drug to drive this food through the intestines which were too weak to do their work. Men would
take (j ru S s to make them sleep and an eye-opener in the morning to make them feel as if they had rested â all dope.
It is well known now that nearly every drug contains from one-half to nine-tenths alcohol, and the rest poison. I'm no advocate of the intem-
perate use of alcohol, but if you have to take it, why can't you take it without the poison? It is proven that in thirty minutes after a drug is
taken the physical vitality is five per cent lower than before taking the drug â that- is, after the stimulation has passed off.
Taking stimulants is like borrowing money for half an hour at five per cent interest â you borrow a dollar and pay back a dollar five in half
an hour. If that scheme kept up would break your bank account, it will just as surely break you down physically. Wouldn't it?
Nature will stand a great deal of punishment, but she will not stand it always. She gives you a strong body to start with, and demands an
accounting.
My method is to help natureâ to add artificial vitality to that you already have. Every one of us has a certain amount, according to our
strength, because vitality is strength. When you lose some of this vitality you are weak â a weak man. My appliance pours a fresji supply into
your.body while you sleep. It generates electricity and pumps that into your nerves. Professor Loeb says that it is the basis of vitality, and mv
cures prove it.
Mr. Wm. Decker. Cnrson City. Nev.. Tvrltos: '"I was sufTerinfir from an extremely amtravated case of varicocele when I came to you for help. There Is not the leaat algn of thlÂ»
complaint now. and I feel better mentally and phystcaly than ever before, and all credit must b<Â» Riven to the Belt. If I can be of any aervlce to you, I am at your command at all timea
and will gladly answer any and all leters written to me by your patrons with the greatest of pleasure.
Now, if you don't feel right, I can cure- you with mv Electric Belt. If you are full of rheumatic pains I can knock them out. I can pour
oil into your joints and limber them up. I have often said that pain and electricity can't live in the same house, and I prove it every day.
Mr. L. J. Harriett of Tlllamook, Or., writes: "Tour treatment certainly does what no other can, for it has cured me. I cannot praise the Belt too highly, and gladly rÂ«c-
ommend it In any case of vital weakness."
If it were not for the prejudice due to the great number of fakes in the land T would not be able to handle the business that would come to
me. The "Free Belt" fraud and the "Free Drug" scheme, which are not free at all. have made every one skeptical, but I know that I have a good
thing, and I'll hammer away until you know ii.
One thine: every man oueht to know is this: Your bodv is a machine. It is run by the steam in your blood and nerves. When vou betdn
to break down in any way you are out of steam. That's just what I want to give you back.
Mr. James Ho!croft. 107 Center st* Santa Cruz. Cal.. writes: "Tour electric belt is all rlcht. I recommend it to all Inquirers, and I <!arÂ« say that you have dozen* of
men under your treatment who have come to you through my recommendation. I have been a resident of Santa Crux County for forty-three years, and my cure Is still a matter

KINIRY MUST
STAND TRIAL
Notorious Burglar Is Held to
: Answer for Murder of Po
liceman James H. Smith
DYING STATEMENT BEAD
Accused Man Says That He
Will Put in His Defense
Before the Higher Court
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, Dec 10.
P. David Kiniry was held to the Su
perior Court to-day by Judge Samuels
without ball for the murder of Police
man James H. Smith on November 27,
M03. Kinlry declined to make' any
statement on his own behalf, saying, "I
do not wish to talk at this time." Chief
Of Police Hodgkin* and Captain Peter-
Fen narrated the confessions made to
them by Kiniry, which connect him
with the crime and under the laws of
this State make him a principal in the
murder, whether he fired the fatal shot
or not.
In all these interviews Klnlry would
â¢relate the events of the evening on
.which the tragedy occurred up to the
time the shooting began, but In none of
them did he admit that he fired the
fatal shot. When asked, "Did you
fhoot Smith?" he always evaded the
Question, the policeman testified, by
â paying. "You do not expect me to tell
3'qu all my case, do you?" He eald he
hid several cards up his sleeve which
he did not intend to play until the trial
in the Superior Court.
W. B. Smith, a brother of the victim,
told of his conversations at the Receiv
ing Hoepitai with the dying man. Po
liceman Smith had said that the man
he shot was cot the one who had killed
him. The witness said the policeman
realized that he was going to die and
made this assertion as the statement of
a dying man. He declared that the
"man who had ehot him ran away, and
he (Smith) fired at the man who re
mained. The evidence shows that Gold
stein was the one who did not run, and
after he had been wounded Kiniry. w ho
was some distance away, returned and
laid him upon the grass when his final
moment came.
Stenographer Eugene C. Van Court
then read the dying statement of Po
liceman Smith, who fully realized that
he was in the grasp of death at the
time he made it. This statement shows
that Smith firmly believed Kiniry had
Jlred the shot and that his own bullet
â was responsible for the death of Gold
stein.
. Kin'ry will not be turned over to the
Sheriff until Monday.

Score So Slany Runs That They
Cannot Be Counted.
-OAKLAND. Dec. 10.â The result of
the baseball game between the officers
of- the San Francisco and Oakland
lodges of Elks is still in doubt, al
thougrh the game took place according
to schedule to-day. After the third
inning the runs came so fast on both
Fides that the official scorer lost track
of the count, and even the small boy
at the score board forgot his duties in
the excitement.
At the end of the game ' ; the San
Prancisco team claimed the victory
by a score of 20 to 19, while the offi
cers of Oakland Lodge declared that
the score was 19 to 14 in their favor.
The decision will be left to the United
States Supreme Court. There was a
good attendance and the Christmas

Whltaker, Professor L. D. Inskeep
and Hugh Hogan, the judges, being
'divided as to their decision. One vot
ed for the affirmative and one for the

the negative debaters and save Creed

It Costs to Go to Church.
â¢ The charge that strangers are not
made to feel at home in some of the
big churches in New York is well
tounded, according to the observation
made by a Pennsylvanian who has
lived here for ten years. "A, few years
ago I rented a pew in one of the big
churches in Fifth avenue and kept it
for a year. My family was not numeri
- cally large enough to nil the pew, and
I notified .he usher that. I could usu
ally accommodate from two to three
strangers. I learned indirectly that the
â¢ sexton, who had the renting of the
pews, obje ted to too much liberality
on my part. He said that if every pew
holder in the church made the same
scrrt of offer he could not come up to
â¢ the expectations of the governing board
of the church, which expected him to
rent every pew. The loflc of this was
â¢ that if strangers desired to attend that
particular church very often they would
be expected to pey for their sittings.
. To put it a little plainer, strangers were
not welcome, although a sign in the
vestibule eald they were." *

FABIOLA REAPS
HARVEST FROM
CALENDAR TEA
By Zoo Green Ttaddlffe.
OAKLAND, Dec. 10.â At last the long
looked for Fabiola tea is over, and by
to-morrow many a pretty calendar or
dainty "thought book" will be speeding
on its Eastward way with Christmas
greetings to some dear one, for scores
of the artistic little Fabiola souvenirs
were purchased to-day at the big char
ity event. From 3 to 6 o'clock the Cha
bot residence, on Madison street, pre
sented a brilliant scene, and to-night
the lady managers of Fabiola Hospital
have a goodly pile of coin to add' to
their Improvement fund.
The programme for the afternoon was
delightful. Mrs. W. E. Crellin sang as
only she can sing, with all the art and
magnetism that have made the name of
Camille d'Arville one to conjure with.
In a stunning gown of gray elaborately
appllqued with a black velvet and jet
pattern, Mrs. Crellin was very fascinat
ing as etae sang Schubert's beautiful
"Serenade," and again, by request,
"Louisette" and "L<ove's Sorrow."
Willard Barton took his audience by
storm with his comic songs, his own
clever composition, "Clara," being the
prettiest and most dashing of the lot.
Mr. Millward's barytone songs, and
Miss Helen Crane's soprano selections
were among the artistic things on the
programme.
Miss Pearl King gave very cleverly
a dramatic reading â something about
"Kentucky Belle"â and Miss Irish's im
personation of a young wife and her
first experience with the cook book was
an excellent bit of work. The pro
gramme closed with several choral
numbers by the German Singing So
ciety that were very fine. Robert Newell,
the prince of accompanists, officiated in
that capacity in his usual delightful
manner.
While the ear was being feasted with
music the eye was equally satisfied, for
there were many gorgeous gowns. I
noticed several very handsome crea
tions In velvet. Mrs. Frederick Cutting
wore a fetching green velvet coat with
pink silk roses appliqued. Mrs. Clar
ence Crowell and Mrs. Arthur Drake
both wore uncommonly pretty gowns
of brown velvet. Mrs. Oscar Luning
was gowned in a chic brown silk, with
a modish and becoming hat of the same
shade, Mrs. Charlotte Elsey, who is al
ways stunningly dresed, wore one of
the new frilled hats, that are so trying
to most people.
Mrs. J. P. H. Dunnâ by the way she it
was who arranged the splendid pro
gramme we enjoyed to-day â wore a
very . attractive costume of green silk
made in the prevailing full style. Mrs.
Felton Taylor, in pale blue, and Mrs.
Charles Lovell, In white, were among
the handsomely gowned women. â¢ Mrs.
W. W. Stahdeford wore a beautiful
pale gray gown, trimmed with some of
the most eauisite lace, and two other
noticeable gowns were those worn by
Mrs. F. C. Watson and Miss Gertrude
Allen, that of the latter being a pecu
liar Bhade of brown silk,, the voke and
full effects given with deep rows of

ROBBED WITHIN
SIGHT OF HOME
J. H. Bailey, Victim of an
Early Evening Hold-Up,
Loses Watch and Money
Oakland Office Son Francisco Call,
â â '.: . 101C Broadway, Dec. .10.,
Once again the fashionable Lakeside
district has been the scene' of a bold
early evening hold-up. . While on^hls
way home at 7" o'clock to-night R. H.
â¢Bailey, residing at 1387 Harrison street,
"was held up by a lone highwayman
at the corner of Nineteenth and Har
rison streets and compelled at the
point of a pistol to hand over 410,
a gold watch and chain and a pocket
knife. The crimo was committed within
a few blocks of the scene of the shoot
ing of Policeman J. H. Smith about a
year ago and at the same hour.
Bailey had almost reached his home
on Harrison street, and while passing
under a row of shade trees that dim
med the lamp lights he heard a soft
step behind him. Before he could turn
he . was startled by the command
"Hands up," which was emphasized by
the pressure of a revolver against the
back of his head. Knowing that he
was powerless to resist, Bailey quick
ly complied with the highwayman's
order.
The footpad at once relieved his vic
tim of his watch and money, and then
facing Bailey toward Alice street told
him to walk straight ahead and hot
look back on penalty of being "shot
full of holes." After walking half a
block Bailey looked back and caught
a glance of the footpad as he disap
peared in the darkness, going In the
opposite direction.; Bailey at once
hastened to his home and notified the
police of his experience. .' : '
Owing to the fact that the footpad
came upon him- from behind," Bailey
could give no description of his as
sailant except that he was a man be
low medium height.
A second hold-up occurred at 9 p. m.
at the corner of Thirteenth and West
streets. W. H. Brltton, who had just
left >his home, was confronted by a
man armed with a revolver. The rob
ber fbok a small amount of silver from
Brittbn, who saved a considerable
amount of .gold hidden in a vest pocket.
A double hold-up occurred at West
Berkeley. L. Rosario and R. Glazio
were held up by two negroes at about
9 o'clock to-night. The negroes had re
volvers and secured ' $5 ; and a silver
watch.
Record of a Gory Decade.
The decade Just closing must be writ
ten in history as one of the bloodiest
epochs of the world. In 1894 occurred
the Chino-Japanese war. Then came
our war with Spain, which was imme
diately followed by England's .war
against the Boers, and now Japan and
Russia are fighting for the mastery of
Oriental- Asia. Besides these great
struggles there were fathers of lesser
size and note, i Italy, Germany, France,
England and Portugal have fought the
native tribes of Africa. Interior Asia
has been the theater of much desperate
fighting. The Dutch have had aw in
surrection to contend with in the East
Indies. Hayti, Central America and
the northern nations of South America
have had rebellions too numerous to
mention, while we have been busily en
gaged for the last four years in sup
pressing uprisings in the Philippines. â

2148 Center Street, Dec. 10.
To be kidnaped, assaulted and
dragged three miles through a sparse
ly.; .aettled : section of North Berkeley
waa the; harrowing, experience yester
day of Miss Bertha Condon,* the 14
year-old daughter of William Condon
of 1616 Delaware street. To her
iriother she related a story appearing
almost impossible of. belief and yet
substantiated in all. particulars by.cir
cumstantial evidence.
The fiend who .perpetrated the of
fense was a stranger, according to the
girl, who accosted her at Francteco
and Sacramento streets as she re
turned home at noon from school.
She was seized by this man. her hands
being tied behind her back with her
own handkerchief, and â  then she was
pushed and pulled along the Santa
F& Railroad track for a distance of
about three miles, stopping, at inter
vals when the man attempted to em
brace her. - â  ./' â ^â ;.' :
'The girl finally made her escape
under the railroad .trestle, near the
quarry at Schmittsville, just over the
Contra Costa County line. Here her
screams might have attracted the at
tention of laborers near by and this
circumstance â  apparently appealed to
the brute, who released his hold upon
her, although none of her entreaties
had affected him on the long Journey
to the place.
Once free, the bruised and "exhaust
ed school girl climbed the bank to the
track and started . on . the Journey
home. She stumbled along, her hands
still tied behind her, making' her. way
with the utmost difficulty. More than
two hours she spent in the return trip
and when she reached the.neighbor
hood of home she was a pitiable ob
ject. â¢ â  â â¢â  ;-:;*^:;. ..- -,-:â¢
. Frank Sullivan, a youth of her ac
quaintance, caught sight of . her . at
Delaware and McGee streets and, hav
ing been told that the girl's mother
was. fretting over her- failure to ap
pear,- he hurried to* inform , Miss, Con
don 'of the fact.- Then he discovered
that his playmate's hands were tied
behind . her back, that iher clothes
were nearly torn from her : body and
that her face was scratched and
bleeding. â¢ He quickly loosened the
handkerchief and -helped her home.
She was put in bed and, none allowed
to see or , talk with her until hours
haa elapsed and she was partially re
covered from her injuries.. . ';/
Vlwas coming back 1 from- school,"
said the girl, in giving an account of
her experiences, "and at the corner
of ' Francisco street, crossing .the rail
road track, a large man I never had
seen before spoke to me and took hold
of -my hands. ' I thought he was jok
ing until he took my handkerchief,
tied my hands and pulled me ' along
with him. Then I screamed, but no
one heard me, I guess. >I begged him
to let me go, but he TVPUld UXQk ''â ' He
crushed me in his arms ' until T lost my
breatb.'and abused me. I hoped some
one would, see us as we went along,
but nobody did. ;"tyhen we got. to the
trestle he > took me down underneath
and then I screamed again as loud' as
I could. .He. got frightened then; I
think, for some men were near there
in the quarry, and when I screamed
he left, I, walked home, but it .was
hard work with my'hands tied behind
me. .,:~:' ''^-iT'
' "The man wore dark clothes. They
had been worn a good deal. He had
a dark mustache, mixed with gray.
He wore a derby hat and I think was
about 40 years old. He was of medi
um height.'.' .
The knot in the handkerchief was
a bundle wrapper's knot, evidently
tied by a man familiar with bundle
.wrapping and tying.
Robert Cameron, an uncle of Miss
Condon, ' began a search for , the
stranger who had abducted his niece,
but found no' trace of him. He did
flnd the girl's school books where she
had dropped- them, a little distance
past the place of the first meeting.
Children in the vicinity of the San
ta Fe depot say they have seen -a
strange man,' loitering about the prem
ises, who' has made advances which
none of them heeded. Deputy Mar
shal,. William Carey made a search for
the abductor, but without success. The
girl is still in a precarious condition,
but Mrs. Condon declares that except
for- bruises and scratches her daugh
ter has not been seriously hurt. ->
Practical Education.
On every hand there are constant ac
cessions to the ranks of those seeking
to 'train themselves in the application
of the : sciences to the practical arts,
this being particularly true of the lines
of activity commonly grouped under
the general names of engineering. The
day of theorizing is past. This is a
practical age and the man best quali
fied for the duties devolving upon him
is the one whose efforts are crowned
with-success and who forges his way
to the front. - Of all branches of edu
cation that of .science and its applica
tion is most costly to the institution
offering such courses, but .the results
achieved by those taking advantage
thereof are proportionately , larger than

BURGLAR'S BRAGGADOCIO
GETS HIM A LONG TERM
Edward Shine Confesses to Jailer
When About to. Be Set Free and
Goes to Folsom Instead..
OAKLAND,; Dec. 10.â Because , he
boasted of a crime Edward Shine, a
self-confessed burglar, must spend
four years at Folsom prison. His at
torney had defeated the prosecution
and Shine was 'about to be set free
when he laughingly told his Jailer that
he was guilty all right, but that they
were going to let him go. The Infor
mation went back to ,the District At
torney's office and the ' case was^ set
for trial. This morning Shine, realiz
ing that he had overplayed his hand,
pleaded- guilty' and got a four years'
sentence. ..
Shine, with Charles Monaghan, was
accused of a burglary at Pleasanton.
Monaghan pleaded guilty and was
sentenced to three years at Folsom.
Shine fought the case. His "pal"
came back and testified in hl3 favor
and the jury disagreed. Under the
circumstances District Attorney Allen
had agreed with Attorney Rode to
dismiss the charge, as he did not be
lieve that aconvictlon could be had,
when Shine, hearing of it, made his
costly boast to the Jailer.
WEALTH IX FRANCE
IS WELL DISTRIBUTED
Tho General Average of Holdings
Is High Throughout the
Country.
The statistics of inheritances in
France, according to a recent report
to the Department of State, as well as
the real and personal property records,
prove that French property is well di
vided. They show that while France is
very rich, her wealth belongs to a ma
jority and not to a minority of her peo
ple. The 1 rich and the excessively opu
lent, possessing millions, are hardjy to
be counted by units; they may be des^
ignated by name. People who read only'
the rates. in the revenues might be led
to think the. country is peopled with
multi-millionaires, and millionaires.
Now, there are not 20,000 millionaires
(that is, possessors of 1,000,000 francs,
or $193,000) in all France. In round
numbers 260,000 persons possess a capi
tal of from $9650 to $38,600; 1,500,000 a
capital of from* $1930 to $9650; ,4,000,000
have from $386 to $1930, and another
4,000.000 have from $96 50 to $386.
Such then is the composition of that
immense army of small savers, the fin
ancial democracy, which constitutes the
force and safeguard of France, One does
not flnd \ immense fortunes, but â  one
finds large numbers of persona holding
Investments, possessing, bonds,, owning
small Darcels of real estate and living
on modest resources and revenues. â 
Out of 10,000,000 voters we have from
7,000,000 to 8,000,000 who are capitalists
and owners of interest-bearing stock,
landed proprietors, holders of Parisian
bopds, Credit Fonder bonds, railroad
bonds, national bondsâ members of co
operative bodies, people who put by for
the rainy day small sums in the banks,
that serve to assure life or Insure
against death. It is not the rich who
.resort to the co-operative companies or
to the savings :banks. There are fully
8,548,218 proprietors who own 61,948
small parcels of property and 125,997,345
parcels of land. The manner of distri
bution of property, real and personal,
constitutes the fortune of France.â

FEDERAL COURT
ASKED TO ACT
Crematory Company Appeals
to Circuit Judges in Con
test With the Scavengers
TAKES IMPORTANT STEP
Prepares Papers on Petition
for Permanent Injunction
Against the Association
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway,- Dec. 10.
The Pacific Incinerating Company,
which controls the garbage crematory
plant of Oakland under a contract with
the city for the disposal of the refuse
of Oakland, â¢ has taken preliminary
steps toward* carrying the fight that
has been on with the Scavengers' Un-.
Ion for two years Into the United States
courts. The first move In this new and
Important development - of the long
fought contest was made to-day, when
attorneys for the corporation procured
a number of affidavits from .policemen
who had been detailed . to arrest .scav
engers charged with violating ! the cre
matory law.
The bill of complaint upon a petition
for a ' permanent Injunction from t'.a
United States Circuit -Court to prevent
further operations by the scavengers
has been drawn and will be filed at
court as soon as the necessary legal
requirements have been met. The at
torneys expect to present their petition
some day of the coming week.
It Is intended to direct the injunction
against the union as an unincorporated
association, the president of which is
John Trucco.
This step results from the failure of
the prosecutions in the Police Courts
of this city of scavengers who were ar
rested for alleged. violations of the law
that was enacted to protect the incin
erating company under Its contract.
The city signed an* agreement whereby
the company was to install an Incin
erating plant to col]ect and destroy on
modern scientific lines the garbage and
refuse of the city. After several months
of preliminary skirmishing the com
pany bought a. site at Twenty-sixth
and Magnolia streets and erected, at a
cost of $20,000 or more, a plant, con
sisting of furnaces and equipment. A
large number of sanitary garbage cans,
with wagons, horses and other neces
sary paraphernalia, were purchased.
The company announced its readiness
to proceed. But its course was sudden
ly blocked by a strenuous and finally
successful protest from the residents of
the locality near the crematory site.
After several months of delay the
corporation met that protest by pur
chasing a new site on the edge of the
West Oakland marsh, well out toward
the bay. Here a large set of furnaces
was installed and temporary structures
were erected. The wagons were put In
operation, and the comp,any began to
assert its rights under its contract.
This contract gave the company, ' as
agents of the city, the exclusive right
to collect and destroy the garbage at
rates fixed by ordinance. .In some in
stances these rates were made a trifle
higher, than those hitherto charged by
the scavengers. And here was the
"crux of the situation.
The company3 pathway was strewn
wth numerous obstacles In the way of
injunction suits in the Superior Court.
But eventually these were disposed 'of
by the company winning. But the res
idents did not rush to the support of
the Incinerating company, despite the
fact that the company had solved the
problem of disposing of the city's re
fuse, -which had been a sore trouble
for many years. The scavengers con
tinued to collect garbage, dumping it
wherever they could flnd a place. The
police, under instructions from Mayor
Olney,- made arrests by the score. The
cases blocked the courts. Each scav
enger deroanded a jury trial. Day
after day the trials went on. But con
victions were few. Evidence of the
strongest character was presented.
Juries, however, persisted in acquit
ting or disagreeing to such an extent
that the prosecuting officers were about
ready to give up In disgust. There, are
to-day many untried cases on the cal
endars and arrests continue.
The scavengers found a haven for
dumping garbage on Bay Farm Isl
and, driving .their teams laden with
Oakland refuse through the streets of
Alameda. They could, therefore, keep
on collecting refuse In Oakland and
thus stay in business* preventing tha
crematory people from getting even a
fair share of the collections, all' of
which, under the. contract, they" were
entitled to take.. . â¢ *.-.'
Alameda has raised her voice against
the scavengers going there,' and the
Board of Trustees has in hand an or
dinance to stop that practice. :'.
Such is the situation after two years
more of contest. The law firms of
Reed & Nusbaumer and Snook &
Church have the Federal court litiga
tion in band for the company.

Court Decision Favors Sloan,
1 PARIS. Dec. 10.â Tod Sloan has re
ceived tardy satisfaction In the de
cision on his appeal to the courts
against the order of the Societe d'En
couragement forbidding him to ride
on training tracks. The court re
versed the decision of the inferior tri
bunal, stating that the society's claim
to apply the article of the racing codÂ©
was unjustified, the Jockey having
committed no infraction of said code.
The decision, however, will not change
Sloan's status, ' as the -society .can ex
clude'him'on the principle of common
law under which the owner of any
property has the right to exclude from
his land any â¢ one he' pleases.
