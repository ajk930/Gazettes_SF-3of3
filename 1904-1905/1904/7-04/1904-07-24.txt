get nice eyes from looking on the nasty
things in this world, Mag.
"Why,"- 1 cried, "what kind of a girl
could cut up like that when she was on
the every edge of discovery?"
"A very smart girl â an actress ; a
good one; a clever thief who's used to
bluffing. Of course," he added softly,
"you won't misunderstand me. I'm
simply, suggesting the different kinds
of girl that could have done what you
did. But, if you don't mind, I'll do the
questioning. Nance Olden," he turned
suddenly j on me, his manner changed
and threatening, "what has become of
that three hundred dollars?"
"Mr. Chief, you know just as much
about that as I do."
. I threw up my head and looked him
full in the face. It was over nowâ all
the shivering and trembling and' fear
ing. Nance Olden's not a coward when
she's fighting for her freedom; and
fighting alone without any sympathiz
ing friend to weaken her.
He returned the look with interest. 4
"Possibly." I shrugged my shoul
ders.
No, It wasn't put on. There never
yet was a man who bullied me that
didn't rouse the fighter in me. I swore
to myself that . this old I thief-catcher
shouldn't rattle me. /
"Doesn't it occur to you that under
the circumstances a full confession
would be the very best thing for you? I
shouldn't wonder if these people would
be ' inclined to ' be lenient with you if
you'd return the' money. . Doesn't it
occur â "
-"'It might occur td me If I had any
thing to confessâ about this purse."
"How long since "you've seen Mrs.
Edward Ramsay?" .He rushed' the
question, at me.
I Jumped.
"How do you know I've ever seen
her." - v
"I do know you have."
"I don't believe you." >. ::'l"^
"Thank you; neither do I believe you,
which is more to the point.' Come,
answer the question: how long is. it
since you have see'n the lady."
I looked at him. Â¦ And then I looked at
my glove, 'and-" slowly,.. pulled. the fingers
inside out, and thenâ then I' giggled.
Suddenly it came to meâ that silly lit
tle insane dodge of mine in the Bishop's
carriage that day; the girl who lost her
name; and the use air that affair might
be-tÂ° me If everâ ,
? >ril tell you if you'll let me think a
minute,"; I said sweetly. "Itr-it must
be all 'of fifteen months."
i "Ah! You see I did know that you've
met the lady. If you're wise you'll draw
deductions as to;other things I know
that you; don't think I do. V * *
And where did you see her?"
."In hVr own home."
"Called there," he sneered, "alone?"
"No," I said very gently. "I went
there, to the best of my recollection,
with the Bishopâ yes, it was the Birh
op, Bishop Van Wageneri."
I could see that he "didn't believe a
â¢ word I was saying, which made me
â¢ happily eager to tell him more.
"Yes,' we drove up to the square one
afternoon in the Bishop's carriage â the
fat. plum-colored one, you know. We
had tea thereâ at least, I did. I was to
have spent the night, but â "
. ."That's enough of that." -
I chuckled. Yes, Mag Monahan, I
was enjoying myself. I was having a
run for my money, even if it was the
last run I was to have.
"So it's fifteen months since you've
seen Mrs. Ramsay, eh?"
. "YeS." . ; : Â¦ Â¦ : ' .--.Â¦ - Â« i
He turned on me with a roar.
- "And yet it's only a week since you
saw her at Mrs. Gates'."
"No? Take care!"
"That night at' Mrs.' Gates', It Tvas
dark, you know,' In the front room. I
didn't Bee Mrs. Ramsay that night. I
friend Obermuller believes you did;
that you got away with the three hun
dred, or hid it away, and "
"And what a stupid thief I must be,
then, to leave the empty purse under
my lounge!"
"How do you know it was empty?"
he demanded sharply.
"You said so. * * * Well, you
gave me to understand that it was,
then. What difference does it make?
It would be a still stupider thief who'd
leave a full purse instead of an empty
one under his own lounge."
"Yes; and you're not stupid. Miss
Olden."
"Thank vou. I'm sorry I can't say
as much for you."
I couldn't help it. He was such a
stupid. The idea of telling me that
Fred Obermuller believed me guilty!
The idea of thinking me such a fool
as to believe that! Such men as that
make criminals. They're so fat-witted
you positively acheâ they so tempt you
to pull the wool over, their eyea. Oh,
Mag, if the Lord. had only made men
clever, there'd be fewer Nancy Oldens.
The Chief blew a blast at his speak
ing-tube that made his purple cheeks
seem about to burst. My shoulders
shook as I watched him, he was so
wrathy.
And I was still 'laughing when I fol
lowed the detective out into the wait
ing-room, where Obermuller was pac
ing the floor. At the sight of my smil
ing face he came rushing to me.
"Nance!" he cried. "
"Orders are, Morris," came in a bel
low from the Chief at his door, "that
no further communication be allowed
between the prisoner and "
Phew! All the pertness lealed out
of me. Oh, Mag. I don't like that word.
It stingsâ it bindsâ it cuts'. v>'
I don't know what I looked like then;
I wasn't thinking of me. I was watch
ing Obermuller's face.
It seemed to grow old and thin and
"Even tho'ugh the Trust Is pushing,
me to the wall; going to such^ lengths
that they're liable criminally as wall as
civilly. If I. could only get my hands
on proof of their rascality. It's true
I can't pay salaries always when
they're due. but I can still raise a few
hundred to help a friend. And Miss
oyien is a friend of mine. If you can
prove that she took this money, you
prove only that she's gone mad, but
you don'tâ"
"All right, Obermuller. You're not
the lawyer for the defense. That'll
come laterâ If it does come. I'll be
glad to bear in mind all you've said,
and much that you haven't" -Â¦.-r-Vvi
"I'm going to ask you a lot of ques
tions, Misg Olden," the old Chief said,
when we were alone. "Sit here, please.
Morris tells me you've got more nerve
than any woman that's ever come be
fore me. so I needn't bother to reassure
you. You don't look like a girl that's
easily frightened. I have heard how
you. danced in the lobby of the Man
hattan, how you guyed him at your
flat, and were getting lunch and hav
ing a regular picnic of a time when â "
* "When he found tkat purse."
"Exactly. Now, why did you do all
that?"
"Why? Because I felt like it I felt
gay and excited and â "
"Not dreaming that the purse was
sure to be found?"
"Not dreaming that there was such a
purse In existence except from the de
tective's say-so, and never fanc^ng
for an Instant that it would be found
in my flat"
"Hm!" He looked at me from under

the station a few minutes
after I got there.

to have your name mixed up with a

on the floor. I counted ih? cracks

He put his hand on my shoulder
and gave it a quick little shake.
"Don't say that about yourself.
You're not a bad lot."
"But â you saw the nurse."

Can you see me sitting there, Mag.
In the bright, bare little room, ivith
the electric lights, still In my white
dress and big white hat. my pretty
Jacket fallen on the floor beside me?
I could feel the sharp blue eyes of that
Detective Morris feeding on my mis
erable face. But I could feel, too, a
Â¦warmth like wine poured into me
from that big fellow's voice.
I put my hand up to him and he
took it
"If I'm Innocent and can prove it,
Fred Obermuller, I'll get even with
you for â for this."
"Do you want to do something: for

"Do I?"

The blood rushed to my face. Nance

ing the white feather â me, whimper
ing like a whipped puppy â me â
Nance Olden! Â»
"You know," I smiled up at him,
"I never did enjoy getting caught."
"Hush! But that's better. . .<
Tell me now â "
A buzzer sounded. The blue-eyed
detective got up and came over to
me. .
"Chiefs ready."* he said. "This
Â¦way."
They stopped Obermuller at the
floor. But he pushed past them." ;.';'
"I want to say just a word to you,
Chief," he said. "You remember me.
I'm Obermuller of the Vaudeville. If
you'll send those fellows out and let
me t-peak to you just one moment. I'll
leave you alone with Miss Olden."
The Chief nodded to the blue-eyed
detective, and he and the other fellow
Â¦went out and shut the door behind
them.
"l want simply to call your at
tention to the absurdity and unrea
ironableness of - this thing," Ober
muller eaid. leaning up against the
Chief b desk, while he threw out his
left hand with that big open gesture
of his, "and to ask you to bear in mind,

â¢Till?"
"Till later I was told."
. "Who told you?" â¢' ,
"Her husband."
He threw down his pencil.
"Lock here, this is no lark, young
woman, and you needn't trouble your-
Velf to weave any more fairy tales. Mr.
Ramsay is in a-he's very ill. His own
wife hasn't seen him since that night,
so you 'see you're, lying uselessly."
Really! So Edward didn't go back
to Mrs. Gates' that nights Tut! Tut!
After his telephone message too.
3 "Now, assuming your Innocence of
the theft, Miss Olden,' what is your
theory; how do you account for tne
presence of that purse in your flat.
"Now, you've hit the part of it that
really puzzles me. N How do you ac
count for it; what Is your theory.
He got to his feet, pushing his chair
back sharply.
"My theory, if you want to know It.
Is that you stole the purse; that your
haggard before my eyes, as the blood
drained out of It- He turned with an
exclamation to the Chief andâ
And Just then there came a Ions rin5
at the telephone. ** >j-< 'Â¦'- Â¦
Why did I stand there? Oh Mag,
when you're on your way to the place
I was bound for, when you know that
before you'll set foot in thU same
bright little room again, the hounds in
half a dozen cities' will have scratched
clean every hiding place you've had.
when your every act will be known and

wait for anythingâ anything in the
world; even a telephone call that may
only be bringing in another wretch

The Chief himself went to answer It
"Yesâ what?" he growled. "Well, tell
Long Distance to get busy. What's
that? St. Francisâ that's the Jag ward,
isn't it? Who is it? Who? Ramsay'."
I caught Obermuller*s hand.
"I don't hear you." the Chief roared.
"Ohâ yes? Yes, we've got the thief, but
the moneyâ no, we haven't got the
money. The deuce you say! Took it
yourself? Out of your wife's purse

you â " .
"Steady, Nance," whispered Ober
muller, grabbing my other hand.
I tried to stand steady, but every
thing swayed and I couldn't hear the
rest of what the Chief was saying,
though all my life seemed condensed
into a listening. But I did hear when
he Jammed the receiver on the hoolc
and faced us.
"Well, they've got the money. Ram

It wasn't safe there under the spread

"I want to apologize to you. Chief,**
I mumbled. .7\

"No. for thinking me not stupid- I

I nodded, and then crumbled to tha
floor.
It was then that they sent for you.
Mag.
Why didn't I tell It straight at tha
first, you dear old Mag? Because I
didn't know the straight of it then my
self. I was so heavy-wltted I never
once thought of Edward. He must hava
taken the bills out of the purse and
then crammed them in his pocket while
he was waiting there on the lounge
and I was pretending to telephone
and â
But it's best as It isâ oh, so best!
Think, Mag. Two people who knew her
â who knew her, mind â believed in
Nancy Olden In spite of appearances â
Obermuller, while we were in the thick
of it, and you, you dear girl, while I
was telling you of it.
XII.
When Obermuller sent for me I
thought he wanted to see me about
that play he's writing in which I'm to
star â when the pigs begin to fly.
Funnie3t thing in the world about
that man. Mag. He knows he can't
get bookings for any play on earth;
that if he did they'd be canceled and
any old excuse thrown at him as soon
as Tausig heard of it and could put on
the screws. He knows that there isn't
an unwatched hole in theatrical Amer
ica through* which he can crawl and
pull me and the play in after him.
And yet he Just can't let go working on
it- He loves it. Mag; he loves it ad
Molly loved that child of hers that kept
her" nursing It all the years of its life,
and left her feeling that the world had
been robbed of everything there was
for a woman to do when it died.
Obermuller has told me all the plot.
In fact, he's worked it out on me. I
know it as it 13, as he wanted
it to be, and .â¢ as it's going to
be. He tells me he's built it up
about me; that it will fit me as never
a comedy fitted a player yet, and that
we'll make such a hit â the play and I
together â that â¢ â¢ ?
And then he remembers that there's
no chance; not the ghost of one, and
he falls to swearing at the Trust.
"Don't you think, Mr. O.," I said, as
he began again when I came into his
office, "that it might be as well to quit
cursing the Syndicate till you've got
something new to say or something
different to rail about? It seems to
me a man's likely to get daffy if he
keeps harping on "
"Oh, I've got it all right, Nance, be
sure of that! I've got something dif
ferent to say of them and something
new to swear about. They've done me
up; that's all. Just as they've fixed
Iringer and Gaffney and Howison."
"Tell me."
He threw out his arms and then let
them fall to his side.
"Oh, it's easy," he cried, "so easy
that I never thought of it. They've
just bought the Vaudevile out of hand
and served notice on me that when
my lease exnires next month they'll
not be able to renew it. 'unfortunate
ly'! That's all. No; not quite. In
order to kill all hope of a new plan
in me they've just let it get to be un
derstood that any man or woman that
works for Obermuller needn't come
round to them at any future time."
"Phew! A blacklist."
. "Not anything so tangible. It's just
a hint, you know, but it works all
right. It works like "
"What are you going to do; what
can you do?" -::.â¢â¢*;
"Shoot Tausig or myself, or both

"Nonsense!" .
"Yes, of course it's nonsense, or
rather it's only what I'd like to
do. â¢ â¢ â¢ But that's not the ques
tion. Never mind about me. It'9
what are you going to do?"
He looked straight at me, waiting.
But I didn't answer. I was thinking.
"You don't realize, Nance, what
those fellows are capable of. When
Gaffney told me. before he gave up
and went West, that here was a gen
uine signed conspiracy among then to
crush out us independents, I laughed
at him. 'It's a dream, Gaffney,' I saiil.

"So there is an agreement!" I
shouted, in spite of myself, as I leaned

he let it swallow him again.

"I don't have to," I interrupted then.

thoujrh he'd been relieved of half his
tnmb'.es.
"I don't have to think it over," I
went on slowly, not looking at the

better try the devil rather than be

"What?â you don't meanâ"

He looked at me. Sitting there en
his dt-sk. his clenched fist on his knee,
he looked for a moment as though he
was about to tiy at me. Then all of a
sudden he slipped into his chair, leaned
back and laughed.
It wasn't a pleasant laugh. Mag. No

seemed to choke him.
"Don't you thinkâ" I began a bit
unsteadily. ,'-*-,
"I think â oh. what a fool I've been!"
That stiffened me.
"Of course, you have." I said cor
dially. "It's silly to fight the push,
isn't it? It's only the cranks that get
cooky and think they can upset the fel
lows on top. The thing to do is to find

door, don't curse, but placate them.

Nevada; of Iringer in the asylum; of

"Admirable! admirable!" he inter
rupted sarcastically. "The only fault I
have to find with your harangue is that
you've misconceived my meaning en
tirely. But I needn't enlighten you.
Go<rd morning. Miss Olden â good-by."
He turned to his desk and pulled out
some papers! I knew he wasn't so des
perately absorbed in them as he pre
tended to be.
"Won't you *hakp hands," I asked,
"and wish nip luck?"
He put down his pen. His face was
white and hard, but as he looked at me
it gradually softened.
"I supposeâ I euppose, I am a bit un

slowly. "I'm hard hit andâ and 1 don't

I had to take that with me to the
Van Twiller, and it wasn't pleasant.
But Tausig received me with open
arms.
"Got tired- of staying out in the coldâ
eh?" ho grinned.
"I'm tired of vaudeville," I answered,
"c'an't you give me a chance in a
comedy?"
"Hm! Ambitious, ain't you?"
" ' "Obermuiler has a play all ready for
meâ written for me. He'd star me fast
enough if he had the chance."
"But he'll never get the chance."
*'Oh, I don't know."
"But I. do. He's on the toboggan;
that's where they all get, my dear,
when they get big-headed enough to
fight us."
"But Obermuller's not like the others.-
He's not so easy. And he is so clever;
Pwhy. the plot of that comedy is the
bulliest thingâ** .
"You've re^.d it â you remember it*"
"Oh, I know it by heartâ my part of
it. You see. he wouldn't keep away,
from me while he was thinking of it.
He kept consulting me about every
thing in it. In a wax, we worked ever
it together."
The little man looked at me, slowly
closing one eye. It is a habit of his
when he's going to do something par
ticularly nasty. -*.
"Then, in a way, as you say, it Is
part yours." . Â¦* '
"Hardly! Imagine Nance Olden writ

"Still you â collaborated; that's the
word. ... I say, my dear, if I could

ever had before he got the cotion of
his cold, sneering eyes that had no

"I â I wouldn't like to make an enemy

"Bah! Ain't I told you he's on the

"But you never can tell with a man

"What're you talking about?"
"Well, it's what I've heard."
"But Heffelflnger and Dixon and
Weinstock are all in with us; who told
you that fairy story?"
"Obermuller himself."
The little 'fellow laughed. His is a

Where In the world she dropped from
heavens knows. The organ-grinder
picked up the shafts of his wagon and
trundled it away. The pickaninnies
melted like magic. But that gay little
flirt, about a year and a half old. just
held on to my finger and gabbled â
poetry. ,
I didn't realize just then that she
was a lost, strayed or stolen. I ex
pected every moment some nurse or
conceited mamma to appear and drag
her away from me. And I looked down
at herâ oh, she was Just a little bunch
of soft stuff; her face was a giggling

that had fallen from her chicken

the blue ribbons at the shoulders, wa3

I can imagine having a little coquette
of my own a bit dirty like that, and
can't just see Nance Olden with a
spick-and-span clean baby, all feathers
and lace, like a bored little grown-up.
"You're a mouse." I gurgled down at
her. "You're a sweetheart. You're a
And suddenly I heard a cry and a
rush behind me.
It was a false alarm; Just a long
legged girl of 12 rushing round the cor
ner, followed by a lot of others. It
hadn't been meant for me. of course,
but in the second when I had remem
bered that precious paper and Tausig's
rage when he should mlsa It. I had
pulled my hand away from that bit
baby's and started to run.
The poor little tot! There Isn't any
reason in the world for the fancies
they take any more than for our own;
eh, 'Mag? Why should she have been
attracted to me just because I was so
undignified as to dance with the pick
aninnies?
But do you know what that little
thing did? She thought I was playing
with her. She gave a crow of delight
and came bowling after me.
â¢That finished me. I stooped and
picked her up in my arms, throwing
her up in the air to hear her crow and
feel her come down again.
"Mouse," I said, "we'll just have a
little trip together. The nur3e that'd
lose yc-u deserves to worry till you're
found. The mother that's lucky
enough to own you will be benefited
hereafter by a sharp scare on your
account just now. Come on, sweet
heart!"
Oh, the feel of a baby in your arms,
Mag! It makes the Cruelty seem a per
fectly unreal thing, a thing one should
be utterly ashamed of imagining, of
accusing human nature of; a thing on
ly an irredeemably vile thing could im
agine. Just the weight of that little
body riding like a bonny boat at anchor
on your arm, just the cocky little way
it sita up, chirping and confident; Just
the light touch of a bit of a hand on
your collar; just that is enough to
push down brick walls; to destroy pic
tures of bruised and maimed children
that endure after the injuries axe
healed; to scatter records that even Iâ
I, Nancy Olden â can't believe and be
lieve, too, that other women have car
ried their babies, as I did some other
woman's baby, across the square.
On the other side Â«I set her down. I
didn't want to. I was greedy of every
moment that I had her. But I wanted
to get some change ready before climb
ing up the steps to the L-statlon.
She clutched my dress as we stood
there a minute in a perfectly Irresisti
ble way. I know now why men marry
baby-women; it's to feel tnat delicious,
helpless clutch of weak fingers; the
clutch of dependence, of trust, of ap
peal.
I looked down at her with that lama
silly adoration I've seen on Molly's
face for her poor, lacking, twisted boy.
At least, I did in the beginning. But
gradually the expression of my face
must have changed; for all at once I
discovered what had been done to me.
-My purse was gone.
Yes, Maggie Monahan, clean gone!
My pocket had been as neatly picked
as I myselfâ well, never mind, as what.
I threw back my head and laughed
aloud. Nance Olden, the great doer-up,
had been done up so cleverly, so surely.
so prettily, that she hadn't had an Ink
ling of it.
I wished I could get a glimpse of the
clever girl that did it. A girlâ of
course, it was! Do yon think any
boy's fingers could do a Job like that
and me not even know?
But I didn't stop to wish very long.
Here was I with the thing I valued
most in the world still clutched in my
hand, and not a nickel to my name to
get me. the paper, and the baby on.

It was the baby, of course, that de

"It's you for the nearest police sta

ing her. "I can't take you home now
1 and show you to Mag."
But she giggled and gurgled back at
; me, the abandoned thins, as though
the police station was just the proper
j est place for a young lady of her years.
It was not so very near, either, that
' station. My arm ached when I got
' there from carrying her, but my heart
ached; too, ta leave her. I told the

desk of Tausig's, Mag. The touch of
every paper Jn It is slimy with some
dirty trick, some bad secret, some
mean action. It's a pity that I hadn't
time to go through 'em all; it would'
have been .interesting; but under a
bundle of women's letters, which that
old fox keeps for no good reason, I'll
bet, I lit on a paper that made my
heart go bumping like a cart over
cobbles.
Yes, there it was, just as Obermuller
had vowed was, with Tausig's
cramped little signature followed by
Heffelflnger's, Dixon's and Wein
stock's; a scheme to crush the business
life out of men by the cleverest, up-to
date trust deviltry; a thing that our
Uncle Sammy just won't stand for. N
And neither will Nancy Olden, Miss
Monahan.
She grabbed that precious paper with
a grasp of delight and closed the desk.
But she bungled a bit there, for Ma
son lifted his head and blinked dazedly
at her for a moment, recognized her
and shook his head.
"No â work to-day," he said.
"Noâ I know. I'll ' just look over
what we've done. Mr. Mason," she an
swered cheerfully.
His poor head went down again with â¢
a bob, and she caught up the type
written sheets of Obermuller's play.
She waited a minute longer; half be- Â¦
; cause she wanted to make sure Mason
was asleep again before "she tore the â¢
sheets across and crammed them down
into the waste basket; half because she i
pitied the old fellow and .was sorry to
take advantage of his condition. But
she knew a cure for this last sorryâ a
way she'd help him later; and when
she danced out into the hall she was
the very happiest burglar in a world :
chock full of opportunities.
Oh, she was in such a twitter as she
did it! All that old delight in doing
somebody else up, a vague somebody
whose meannesses she didn't know,
was as nothing to the joy of doing
Tausig up. She was dancing on a vol
cano again, that incorrigible Nance!
Oh, Â¦ but such a volcano, . Maggie! It
atoned for a year of days when there
was nothing doing; no excitement, no
risk, nothing to keep a girl interested
and alive.
And, Maggie, darlin', it was a won
derful volcano, that one, that last one,
for it .worked both ways. It paid up
for what I haven't done this past year
and what I'll never do, again in the
, years, to come. It made up to me for
all I've missed and all I'm going to
miss. It was a reward of demerit for
not being respectable, and a preventive
of further sins. Oh, it was such a vol
cano as never was. It was a drink and
a blue ribbon in one. It was a bang
up end and a bully beginning. It was â
It was, Tausig coming in as I was
going cut. Suddenly I realized that,
but I was in such a mad whirl of ex
citement that I almost ran over the lit
tle fellow before I could stop myself.
"Phew! \Vhat_a. whirlwind you are!"
he cried. "Where are you going?"
"Oh, good morning, Mr. Tausig," I
said sweetly. "I never dreamed you'd
be down so early in the morning."
"AVhat're you doing- with the paper?"
he demanded suspiciously.
My eye followed his. I could have
beaten Nancy Olden In that minute for
not having sense enough to hide that
precious- agreement, instead of carry
ing it rolled up in her hand.
"Just taking it home to go over it," I
said carelessly, trying to pass him.
But he barred my way.
-""Where's Mason"" he asked.
"PoOr Mason!" I said. "He's â he'3
asleep."
"Drunk again?" "
I nodded. How to get away!
"That settles his hash. Out he goes
to-day. â¢. . . It seems to me you're
. in a deuce of a hurry," he added, as I
tried to get out again. "Come In; I
want to talk something over with you."
"Not this morning," I said saucily. I
wanted to cry. "I've got an engage
ment to lunch, and I want to go over
this'stuff for Mason before one."
"Hm! An engagement." Who with,
now?"
My chin shot up in the air. He
laughed, that cold, noiseless, little
laugh of his.
"But suppose I want you to come to
lunch with me?"
"Oh, thank you, Mr. Tausig. .. But
how could I break my engagement
withâ"
"With Braun?" \^
"How did you guess it?" I laughed.
"There's no keeping anything from,
you."
He was immensely satisfied with his
little self. I "I know himâ that old ras
cal," he said slowly. "I say, Olden,
just do break that engagement with
Braun."
"I oughtn'tâ really."
"But doâ eh? Finish your work here
and we'll go off together, us two, at
12:30, and leave him cooling his heels
here when he comes." He rubbed his
hands gleefully.
"But I'm not dressed."
"You'll do for me."
"But not for me. Listen; let me
hurry home r^ow and I'll throw Braun

He pursed up his thin little lips and

Just what I'd been hoping for I don't
know, but I knew that my chance had
come that morning.
For a week I had been taikihg Ober
muller'8 comedy to Mason, the secre
tary. In the evenings I stood about in
thewingsand watched the Van Twil
ler company in "Brambles." There
was one fat role in it that I just ached
for, but I lost all that ache and. found
another, when I overheard two of the
women talking about Obermuller and

"He found her and made her," one of

"Fine â fine! A reading from the fool

Woman Errant

pie child living with poverty-oppressed
parents in Bohemia, and his life one
long sigh to get to Prague and be
trained to become a great musician.
Life has for him no present joy except
the dream of what the future may
hold. "Some day, perhaps!" his father
tells him, and the promise sings in his
mind perpetually, save only when the
refrain sinks in despair moods and he
cannot help thinking: "If some
one should Â«ay 'You may not go to
Prague,' I would fall dead." So- he
does dutifully the poor boys' everyday
duties that irk, and in semi-suppressed
Irritation and restlessness thinks he
may go mad, and wishes to kill some
thing or cut off his own flnsrersâ
swears that he will kill something. <He
loves his father and resolves that some
day he will be. a father just like that.
His brother bores him and his sister,
with whom he has to sleep, he detests
as a lumpish thing who breathes heav
ily and sweats. The most princely lux
ury he dreams that wealth could give
him would be to have a pillow all his
own and all to himself. "
Later this pillow passion of his adol
escent dream has a pathetic develop
ment. When, away from home, a youth
green about all things save the music
he studies, remembering how melan
choly his father often was in the old,
poverty-smitten home, he imagines
his father's sadness might have been
partly the same pillowlesa sadness of
his childhood deprivation. His dear
father never had a pillow all to him
self. "There was always a woman and
a child between him and that haDPi
ness." So he resolves to save the money
of a meal done without every day till
it amount to the price of a bed and a
pillow to send home as a present to hia
beloved father.
Belonging in the middle of this pil
low story there is another pillow story
of like . originâ but this is a romantic
oneâ a tale of the musician boy's first
loveâ amusing, tooâ let us listen to the
beats of the boy's heart: There is a
girl there in his class, pale, passionate,
half-sick, studious, interesting, pains
taking, having much of talent, but
more of adoration of the ' tal
ents of others. Her the boy
loves without ' fully comprehend
ing yet what love is. His father
had told him there would be beautiful
women ; in the cityâ radiant like the
sun; but the .similitude does not ap
peal to himâ he dreams that a silvery,
moonlight ; lady would alone be . lovely
, In his | hope of paradise. | This girl is
something that way. He calls her
Twilight. The girl beholds the rising
sun of the boy's talent and adores it
and him. When she is ailing he visits
her. in her room and holds her hand.
He observes that she is often sad.
Sympathetically he seeks in his mind
for a possible cause; Â¦ he remembers
that thef worst part of his poverty
days was pillowlessness, '', the greatest
luxury of lightening fortune was to
have a bed ; and a pillow all his own;
perhaps the poor girl was oppressed as
his childhood wasâ her nights sleepless
and sad because she had to try to
sleep beside some one who lay lump-
lshly and breathed heavily and sweat.
He postponed the y purchase of his
father's pillow. His father could wait,
for he had waited long and had got
used to waiting. So he saved his sup
per money and learned to love to go
supperless to bed for love of the Twi
light girl. At last he sent her the bed
and pillow anonymously. She divined
the donor, and coming down to the
conservatory thanked him frankly.
She did not care so much about the
separate pillow, but it pleased her
mightily that the bov cared so much
for her. He did not stop starving a
meal a day, however, until he had
bought his father a separate bed and
pillow to be all his own.
This was the musician's first love,
but not his first experience of being
loved. That is another story of artis
tic temperament. The peasant women
round his father's home did not please
the boy's eyes. He wondered that wo
men should be called fair. Looked at
from front or rear they appeared to
him to be too square. From a side
view they seemed as if Providence had
fastened cushions on them in unseemly
places. The miller's daughter took a
fancy to him. When he came with the
family grist she went a quarter to
meet him and insisted on carrying his
sack and talking to him. When he sat
down by the millrace she sat beside
him. He threw rocks in the stream,
looked at the birds and leaves, but not
at her, for lie liked her not She
pressed her foot against his and gig
gled.
Then she kissed him aloud. The
adolescent artist rose in wrath, and,
being stronger than she, beat her. He
did it with a shingle which he found
lying handy. Did it with the shingle
until the shingle broke. Then he did
it with a little plank. The little plank
broke also.
Later the youth fett sad about what
he had done. But his regret was more
of malicious remorse than of pure pen
itence. He was not satisfied with the
amount of pain he had given the mill
girl, for he feared she was too fat to
feel. He went home and told his
father what the girl did to him and
what he did to the girl. That confi
dant told him confidently that a very
fat girl could not be very much hurt
by that method. So the boy artist
day-dreamed of meeting the mill girl
in some hereafter when she should
have grown lank and lean enough to
feel with stinging poignancy a shingle
or a little plank.
Very good in the telling of what the
artist nature is are the accounts of the
absented-mtndedness, the absorption,
the transport to other-where of these
superlative doers when they are doing
their finer things. When the boy first
leaps to the vantage ground from which
he can command fortune and fame he
is on the stage but forgets it, stares at
the audience but sees It not, compels
applause but hears it not: the begin
nings of his own music gradually bear
him away to his father's home, and the
memory of that father's fondness grows
sweeter and sweeter as he plays on
arid onâ until asleep to his surround
ings he awakes in othÂ»r- where and
story well told by a personality we like
to listen to Just^ partly for the linger
compelling pull "of, the personal touch
itself; and if we take the point' of view
that possibly Ivory Steele lived out her
life correctly because of the peculiar
ambitious nature she was born endow
ed with, yet was there in it the in
terest of a heart-wring thwarting both
to herself and that persistent lover who
lost the love-half of his life because she
had promised the dreams of his youth
that which the wealth of her woman
hood was not whole enough, to be able
to give.
For consideration of the general
question of non-domestic woman there
are some sentences worth culling. Here
is one from, the doctor who gave the
definition of the woman errant: Says
Barbara: "No man that lives gives
woman a truly higher place than fath
er, yet from his rich experience none
better knows the Indisputable actuality
of her nerve limits, whose fount is
identical with the form of her exist
ence." In a letter from "Anne, wife of
Aqulla Truesdale, professor of soci
ology," occurs this quotation: "With
woman the permanence of the broader
training that fits for the higher "pro
fessions can never be relied upon, and
therefore is of little consideration. As
long as she is the Matrix of the race,
"when her hour strikes she must yield
or suffer, for nature forbids the double
strain." ../â¢..
After all, about books on this phase
of the woman Question, whether they
be in fiction form, or treatise deep on
philosophy, physiology, or sociologyâ
anent the body or the soul of the thing
âare they not but either sensibly cor
roborative of, or futllely fencing
against, what has been definitely set
tled forever by Tennyson when he
wrote the Princess? That deliverance
sounds as if it were the decision of
some supernal Supremest Court, writ
ten by the hand of a divinely chosen
Chief Justice; and all special made to
move us romantically to its acceptance
because the message comes in sweet
est music, and presses true philosophy
deep home upon our hearts in all the
persuading power of truth when it ut
ters itself in poem.

York, 11 50.)
ly a feminine, modern progress pro
duction having the medieval knight
errant for prototype, although there is
a little of that sometimes in the mo
tives, which are mixed. Neither is
the woman errant what Is meant DV
the current term an erring woman,
but that she is a woman who errs Js
evidently the ocinion of "the author.
The girl who is the woman errant of
the story did not baptize herself by
that title, but the thing happened
thus; She started to tell Bradford, a
university professor of literature,
what she was, "I am" â (here the soft
voice hesitated for a wordâ "a woman
errant," said Bradford. So the name
donated by the professor of literature
to the woman who hesitated about her
designation stuck, and to learh its full
significance means jio less than read
ing: Barbara's book. â¢ Â¦ ~. '.
After the girl lived through her er
rantry till the issues of life have made
definite show-up, Horace Bradford is
cornered in intellectual company and
deliberately challenged by Barbara to
define what he meant by the term
"woman errant"; "for the term has
haunted me of late and the people to
whom it is applied seem so widely dif
ferent. Is it a woman who works,
who goes out to get her living, or is
it a trite name for a pose?" Bradford
is embarrassed by the difficulty of put
ting his meaning into the form of ex
act words and can only say: "It Is a
subtle condition that I mean, rather
than a pose." Then he refers the
term for interpretation to Dr. Russell,
who is Barbara's father, "a country
physician of culture and experience,
also a bookworm." Bradford stipu
lates, "It most certainly contains no
strictures upon the workers of life."
"No, not upon work," said Dr. Rus
sell, "for love and work are our justifi
cation for existence, coupled with the
faith that makes either possible. Yes,
'fide, amore, labore,' that is the posi
tive trinity of life. It is not the doing
but the way of it that marks the
distinction to me. The woman errant,
God help her, it seems to me, is she
who either from choice, hazard or ne
cessity seeks a cause outside the pro
tecting wall of her natural affections!"
The- particular woman errant whom
the author has chosen chiefly to
delineate and give a name to the type
is Ivory Steele. An apt name, for
she Is morally as white as ivory, in
heart, as cold as steel and in intellect
like a rapier "made of the finest tem
per of that metal. She despises the
prospects of domesticity, and evidently
to the heart of Barbara, who is a
hearth lover dedicating her book to
some certainly adored, but merely
Initialed "Brave Home Maker," the
Ivory steel girl is a barbarous breaker
of hearts and' preventer of home
happiness that might be but for her
perverse vagaries of "all is vanity"
ambition. It was the "way of her
doing It" that marks the distinction
of this woman errant from those who
are non-domestic, but not because of
such love-life challenging choice. She
had a father amply able and lovingly
willing to provide for her at home;
she had a mother who needed her at
tendance and companionship; she had
a most worthy lover .whom she ac
cepted, but put off from year's end to
year's end until it virtually amounted
to refusal; she declined to live in com
panionship with the girls who ad
mired her and proffered to dwell with
her. All this because the pride of
being independent and the call of a
possible clever career was the su
preme appeal to her nature.
Thus the author shows us a type
of woman she dubs the woman errant
who must not be taken as an example
to prove that the home renouncers are
wholesalely wrong as a class. , i

the sensible limits of woman's sphere,

very mention cf the name of "Mary,

feel that ehe will still delight in calling
herself, and by "divine right," too,
"Mary, Queen of Scots," reigning in
her purifled and nobler self over the
hearts of the Scottish people long after
turbulent, brave, beautiful, cruel Scot
land has gone back to the chaos out of
which her pardoning Creator called It.
And not the men of Scotland only, by
birth or by descent, but the chosen men
of all races and all ages will eagerly
seek to be. in some chivalrous sense,
subjects loyal and loving, by adoption,
of "Mary, Queen of Scots!" So her
etory fascinates us forever.
Hewlett's story is not of the whole
of her life, but only that part of it
which he calls "the six years' tragedy."
It begins with her coming from France
and her girlish widowhood from the
invalid bey, Francis, to attempt to rule
over her own turbulent Scots.*. It takes
her through the soul-warping stress of
her marriage with Lord Darnley;
.through all the entanglements of her
affection for her favorites who adored
her; and thence through all the ter
rible consequences of her full blown
woman's passion for the ambitious but
unworthy Bothwell. When that is all
over, then his voice ceases to tell her
history, for it is this fragment has ap
pealed to him as the most important
in her life. So out of the records of
this period he extracts the "quair" â
the little heart-book of the Queen.
When the doors of Holyrood Pal
ace closed forever against her who
had reigned there as Queen of Scots
IT was not without the warrant of
literary wisdom that Maurice
Hewlett, saill persistent to avoid
being that "has been" which is
"to hang, quite out of fashion like a
rusty nail," and to hold continuously
his high rank in the realm of English
letters, chose for the subject of a new
essay a conquest in that field wherein
he moves to our imagination as a
bright-mailed champion knight, a ro
mantic historical novel fetched from
the fountain source of the heart -life
of Mary. Queen of Scots.
He calls it "The Queen's Quair," and
as that term sounds, queer and query
challenging to most of us who are not
adepts in the interpretation of archaic
phrase, first and foremost we should
seek for light on the name of the thing
to which this knight of romance writ
ing would have us lend a loving ear.
A "quair" is a little book â that's as
easy as consulting any complete dic
tionary, but in the case of this
"Queen's Quair" there is much more
to it than Just that. This overplus
needs explaining:, and our author does
it very prettily. "In one such a cer
tain King wrote fairly the tale of his
love business." This certain King was
.a Stuart ancestor of that romantic
Scottish Queen who stands forever be
fore the imagination of all chivalric
manhood as the most fascinating: and
most questioning question mark that
Â¦was ever incarnate in a fair woman's
form. "Here," says Hewlett, "in this
other, I pretend to show you all the
tragic error, all the pain, known only
to her that moved in it." But how?
we readers wonder, if "known only to
her." Listen close to his sentence tell
ing how he does it: "But the whole of
it lay in her heart, and to know her
Is to hold the key of that." So â and
sincerely so, he seeks to read the "rid
dle of the Sphinx" and unravel the
"mystery of Queen Mary." "Suppose
her hand had been at this pen; sup
pose mine had turned that key; there
might have resulted The Queen's
Quair. 1 Certainly we must say that
method is a sovereign one, provided
only human genius has the strength to
let love-sure intuition make up the
missing links between the correctness
of old records and what that suffering
and sinning heart of hers held secret
locked and hid the key where none
but those who loved her might ever
and she was roughly borne away on
the long ride to the picturesque island
stronghold, Lochleven Castle, there to
be Scotland's captive, we venture to
say that hour is the supreme crisis of
her life. It was then thai, the crash
came, the falling into irrevocable ca
tastrophe of all the hopes and ex
pectations that a woman once crown
ed and throned both over a .material
kingdom and the empire of men's ad
miration might have held treasuredly
in her heart.. After that the tragedy
of her life but descends slowly like
the music of tolling bells through the
misery and repentanVe of long im
prisonment to the time of her laying
her fair face on the headsman's block.
So in that momentous Journey from
Holyrood Palace to Lochleven Castle
we see Mary pass from the heaven of
life's hope to the hell of life's de
spair, and as the beauty of those two
famous places stamps them upon the
memory of their pictured' semblances,
imagination goes back and .watches
Mary pass from her palace to" her
prison and Inwardly we weep for all
the wall-stuff that was woven into her
life, pray for the wiping away of all
sin with which she may have stained
her soul.
It is with tr; summons to leave
Holyrood Palace and hastily prepare to
start for Lochleven Castle â with the
closing of her palace door, that Hew
lett's book closes. In a last scene he
shows us how Mary realized when too
late that the boy lover, who gave up
his life for her in fighting to save
the incriminating: casket which con
tained the records of her guilty pas
sion for Bothwell, had in his heart
what might have been one of the most
precious treasures of her life. He tells
dramatically of how her love for
Bothwell misspent itself, and of how,
when her desire was dead, she re
fused his kiss, saying, "your lips are
foul â you have kissed too many." But
before this he tells in his own mas
terful way of how this man had fas
cinated her. She is in the sick' room
with her husband, Darnley. She had
learned to loathe him for his mind
and morals, and now she loathes him
fully because his body has become
foul to fit the spirit that dwelt In it.
She is writing a letter in this sick
room. She plays passionately with a
crucifix, and mixes the adoration of it
with the damning of this letter, which
is a love one to Bothwell.
But listen to her own words, and to
those of Hewlett's comment: "Once,
after a frenzy of penmanship, she
held out her hands to it (the crucifix)
in protest; then reverently took it up
and kissed it, to sanctify so the words
she was writing: 'The good year send
us that God knit us together forever
for the most faithful couple that ever
he did knit together.' Paris (Both
well's servant) knew very well to
whom. she wrote so fully, who was to
read this stained, passionate letter, ill
scrawled on scraps of old paper,
scored v/ith guilt, blotted with shame
ful tears, loving, repentant, willful,
petulant, unspeakably loyal and ten
der, all by turns." That is Mary in a
paragraph.

York. II 50.)

makes the music for his father only;
that father who had helped him so de
votedly to his desire â who had prom
ised to his yearning: boyliood Prague.
Success, paradise â "some day â some
time"; so he makes the music say that
Success, paradise â "some day â some
time," and the audience know not
where the soul of the musician is. but
he lifts them away up enraptured with
his art, and when, in cessation he lets
them down to earth again, the applause
says that the "some day â some time"
so lovingly promised and so coerclngly
called is come at last, and that the
pupil is proclaimed a master.
Now let us note the inspiration of ths
tuxt victory of the young musician. It
is in Vienna. His talent 13 recognized;
he is expected to do fine things; his au
dience i3 the elite of the land; his sun
has arisen; and his inspiration now is
a sun woman â one of those women,
bright, brilliant, beautiful, whom hi3
father had told hl3 boyhood dwelt far
away in splendor in splendid cities.
This is his second triumph and in it he
sees only the sun- woman, diamond
decked, shining shouldered, brightly
smiling, and he plays for her alone.
This second Inspiration, absorption,
transport, wins again; and while the
world wonders whence the music came
the artist knows it is the Countess
Alexelevna- In hla diary he wrote this:
"To touch that Russian woman's hand
I would give all but that single moment
of my life."
So much for the good that sun wom
en do; now let us consider the shadow
sadness that errant genius In combina
tion with sun women cast3 upon Its
own and other lives. "Where was the
twilight girl when the artist thrilled
delighted throngs, but saw the sun
woman only and played ror her alone?
The pillowless girl for whom the aspir
ing youth had starved to provide a bed.
pure white linen pillowed, luxuriously
clean and all her own. She Is sick now
and seems to need a pillow and a bed
more than all else. But the good God
knows that If the love once given to the
twilight girl had not left her, drawn
away by the sun woman, or If it would
come back before it was all too late,
then could she leave that fevered pil
low, dearly pressed even in pain with
dear memories, <as certainly as if the
Son of God had said, "Arise, take up
thy bed and walk." She dies maiden
pure on the pillow gift of a genius-gift
ed boy's first love. Not so the sun
woman. The artist records the death in
his diary thus: "Josef told me. He
said, 'What are you made of?* He
thinks me hard and cold. "Why, I am
as soft as a little child; If my father
should break his arm I could never play
again. I am burning with fever. With
Alexeievna living, who mourns for
Ludmila dead?" Luc! mil a was the
name of the twilight girl.
It Is interesting to note why the ar
tist nature came to hate this Alexe
ievna. It is a little bit redeeming of
deviltry. She stayed with him and
away from her husband; that did not
worry the musician nor any way dim
the dazzling of the sun woman. She
stayed away from her dying child
through coward fear of contagion. The
artist begs her to go, but she dares
not. The hereafter^ name for her In
his diary is "Hyena," and he hate3
the fair thing which he had held away
from husband and child, calling the
dalliance Heaven.
Dolores Bacon does not comment on
this diary she edits; she Just gives
you the diary to read, mark, and in
wardly digest. Be it imagination's
creature or a study from the life of a
single character, or a composite drawn
from many she knew and knew of,
the study Is good of an artistic tem
perament too much mixed with good
and evil, where the evil was willfully
let be preponderant, to rise to mas
tery more than mediocre. He played
in gratitude for his father's fondness,
and made his art fine thereby: he fed
and no doubt richly nourished his
growing genius on the love of the,
twilight girls; he leapt from adolei
cence to manhood's love and achieve
ment under the spell -of the inspira
tion of one of the sun women whom
his father's words had made hia boy
hood day-dream about; but his sun

the music he made for her was falsely
fine; and we find nothing in the lines,

any measure to make his music a lit

different would the story of his art

given him more genius, and made of
her a true sun woman?

5work. Perhaps that is one reason why
Adam and Eve went wrong in the
beautiful Garden of Eden, because they
really did not have enough to do, and
when by divine fiat they were driven
out and compelled to begin a life of
toil this apparent curse was to prove
ultimately a blessing to them and to
their long line of descendants. Men
differ in their capacity to sing and
paint and orate, but the one tie that
binds humanity together Is its ability
to work. And when one ceases to work
he ceases to grow;' He begins to de
generate and becomes like the ower
animals.
This being the case, joy. ought to gp
with work as naturally as song floats
from the mouth' of a bird., To, think
that day by day we are bringing some
thing to pass, adding to the useful
products of the world, realizing our
best selves in things tangible, . adding
to the sum total of things actually
done, "is an immense Inspiration. And
to do things well, even if they be me
chanical tasks, to give a fine finish
to the product, to eliminate every mark
of haste and carelessnessâ that is ; an
other source of happiness. Talking
with 'the motorman on the front plat
form the other evening, I was glad to
hear him say, "For nine years I have
been in this business, and I have never
had any accident. It is only careless
fellows that have accidents." Certain
ly, he had the artist's pride in his work,
tedious and taxing as it is.
And another foundation ' of \ Joy : in
Then, too, we may know that aside
from the returns to our own kin we are
making existence more tolerable for a
wider circle. Our fidelity and skill and
persistence constitute* a contribution
to the ori-golng of humanity. We may
never know who will use the utensil
which we make or who will be bene
fitted by the sale over the counter or
how all this humdrum typewriting aids
the progress of the kingdom of God,
but nothing is i truer than that the
faithful labor of every worker is need
ed''in this modern world^ to drive the
wheels of civilization and move for
ward the car of . !
Whatever you are doing,- then, com
pel it to pay. a tribute of. happiness to
you'day by day. Something more con
genial may come by: and by, but while
you are -manifestly, put where you are
and while others may be depending on
you, work - not like a galley . slave but
like a free, man and a Christian. La
boring in -this spirit you will find all
the sweeter the more ample leisure, the
more delightful surroundings and the
greater . , good fortune which in God's
providence may be yours by ami by.
work is the thought that our work adds
to the comfort and happiness of others.
What an exquisite satisfaction the hus
band and father may find even in hard
manual toll because the labor of his
hand Is day by day transmuted into
bread and meat for the ones- whom
loves most -of all in the world. One
can endure long hours and unpleas
ant surroundings if happy little faces
dance before one's vision in the midst
of the smoke of the foundry and the
whir of the factory.
3^ HIS is the new evangel and Presi
dent Eliot of Harvard is its
prophet. Repeatedly in public
addresses of late he has sought
to show that the fundamental question
with every worklngman is not one of
wages or hours or holidays or environ
mentâImportant though all those as
pects of the case are â but one of per
sonal happiness in work and of pro
moting through work the happiness of
others.
This is not the easiest of all proposi
tions to prove to-day. The derisive
laughter which its first enunciation
evoked among the laborers who heard
it shows how unpalatable a truth it is.
The movement of our age is in another
direction. We are all concerned prima
rily with the effort to obtain more ease,
leisure and creature comforts. We
look upon work simply as a means to
that end and we want to do just as lit
tle work a3 possible and to win as
much reward as we can. To those who
tend a, machine all day long there
seems to be a wide chasm between
the work done by such professional
men as President EUot and their own.
And we all have frankly to, admit that
if one must work he would rather
choose his post of duty thab have it
assigned to him. > \
But, after all. 'President Eliot is
right, both historically and philosoph
ically. History shows and observation,
confirms the fact that the happiest
people are the.buslest ones, and that In

shoulders. "And, Miladi, I love you."
Miss Churchill took the girl into her
arms and kissed her.
"But I'm not more to you, Gloria,
than Jose Rubino."
"I love you, Miladi."
Miss Churchill walked rapidly to and
fro. She looked at the girl and kissed
her again. The situation made her
desperate. It was a chance, and he
might be shot at any moment.
"Gloria, if you do this you shall have
a hundred American dollars, and you
and Jose may be with me always. But
can I "
"Miladi," said the girl quickly, "don't
think of me. I love Jose now, but I
have had other lovers."
She spoke with an air of pride that
left Miss Churchill smiling.
"Oh, I see. Poor Jose. You will re
ward him."
"Certainly. Miladi."
To Gloria's eyes Miss Churchill saw
she was like an angel and Jose only
like a lover.
"And, besides, we can't marry with
out money, Miladi." the girl continued.
"You shall have moneyâ just for the
offer, Gloria. And. Gloriaâ send himâ
send him. But, Gloria "
She remembered what she had read
that morning of Bates' engagement to
the horrible widow.
"Yes, Miladi."
"No one must know that I ever
made you do it Swear by the Christ
there, over the cathedral door."
"I swear, Miladi." . *.Â£
"Send him, then. Gloria," Miss
Churchill said quickly. ;*'^ V J
"Oh, what have I done!" she cried,
when the girl had gone.
The tumult had died. Rumor had
it the fight was going the President's
way. Forsyth, the Consul, was busy
and nervous. Anglo-Saxon interests
were in his hands. But he had only
the sentiment the flags t inspired and
no war vessel to enforce his demands.
Miss Churchill,' standing on the con
sulate balcony, saw a wild-eyed priest
come out of the cathedral and raise
his hands high, 'While a crowd of poor
folk thronged about him. His voice
was raised in deep earnestness.
"For the God of peace bringeth bat
tle, 1 and the God of battle peace. And
lo, he is one God, the God of all na
tions."
A messenger ran . into the office of
the consulate.
"The American cruiser Triton is in
the harbor." â¢ -
"Thank God!" cried the Consul.
"We will have a Scotch on that, Ren
dell." ......
. In the servants', quarters Gloria was
talking to her lover, the little Sergeant
Rubino.
"The Virgin be thanked, Jose mine,
that you are not shot The English
Miladiâ what a fool is she to think I
Â¦would send you out to to get a bullet.
But we have our marriage portion.
Jose, mine. Ah, these fools of Eng
lish."
The boyish ensign who commanded
the bluejackets that patrolled the
streets of San Fernandez was in the
salon of the English Consulate that
evening. And there , -were Christopher
Bates and his friend. Mr. Niles. and
Lady Rendell and the others. The lit
tle ensign was quite your hero, though
he did not consider himself at all. He
had made a little charge and cleared
the streets, and lo, the rebellion had
ceased, as if by magic â the magic be
hind the good ship Triton's guns.
Miss Churchill was fidgeting and
went out on the veranda, where the
moon streamed peacefully and senti
mentally. ;':Â» Y
What if she knew? What if Gloria
had told?
Bates followed her.
"It's odd, isn't itâ our meeting here?"
"Very."
"And all this little fiasco of a rebel
lion."
"Quite ridiculous and interesting. But
how could you leave Mrs. Chester io
long?" she asked.
â¢You read that?"
"Yes, and I congratulate you."
"And I you â on yours."
"Oh, do you, do you? Thank you. 1 *
It was very hot. What if Gloria had
told? What if he knew how she had
fainted?
"But "
"Well?"
"It was only a newspaper report,
Louise, and I am down here on
the Brunnhilde. I heard you had brok
en with Wharton, and I wish to heaven
those chaps had shot me, if you arÂ«
going to send me away," the young fel
low blurted out.
She turned to him and put both her
hands In his.
"Christopher Bates, you are the very
nicest rnxson I know â and â and â ah.
what makes you make me tell you?
Yes. I do love you, and I have been bo
miserable." . â¢
That night Gloria asked her mlstrwa:
"And the marriage portion. Miladi?"
"Gloria." Miss- Churchill cried, "you
shall have a thousand American dollars
ânot a hundredâ and the prettiest wed
ding San Fernandez can furnish."
"You are an angel." quoth Gloria;
and she told it all over to the Sergeant
Rubino in high glee.
So. through the rebellion of Mende*
were there two love affairs brought to
their proper end. and President Gon
zales ruled in San Fernandez until he
decamped with the treasury. Sine*
that occurrence he has rtsided.*in Paris.
And then, after some "moments, she
wont on *
"You love him." She forgot herself.
"Yes, Gloria."
"I knew it Miladi, as I love Jose
Rubino, who is here."
"How came he here, when Â¦ 1"
"Humph! Miladi, Jose would be shot
for no Presidentâ only for me. He ran
away; but, Miladi "
"Yes."
"I can send him back tq the prison.
He has the keys to a little back gate,
and he can get them here."
"He canâ but he does not want to be
shot!" Miss Churchill cried in won
der. K .
"It would be for meâ not for a Presi
dent," said the girl, shrugging her
"They can't get to the prison, dear
est, but it wilji only be a kittle time.
Don't worry, only lie still until you get
your nerves together; that's a good
girl. I will leave Gloria to look after
you for a few moments."
Miss Churchill tried to lie. still after
her sister had gone, then suddenly the
organ pealed from the cathedral above
the noise.
"They are praying in there, Miladi."
Gloria said. "The church its crowded

"Bertie has no more tact than a por
cupine or he would have knownâ"
"What?"
"What I know, my dear. But he is

"And James Forsyth hasn't got them

- "The old chap thought that, if they
are as they represent themselves, we
would pull down his old* town about
his ears. I knew you would know the
writing. And it's that fellow Bates.
Extraordinary, by Jove!"
And then Miss Churchill knew no
more, for she had fainted. When she
came to herself she was on her own
bed and Lady Rendell was holding her
hands and giving her salts/ while
Gloria, deep sympathy in her dark
eyes, was fanning her. From outside
came the noise of tumult.
"What is all that noise?"
"They are fighting in the streets."
"Oh, I remember, and â " J
Miss Churchill sighed, gave the gir..
some silver, and went to her room with
a headache.
A few days after there came rumors
of an uprising of a certain Mendez
against the President's authority, and
then with the suddenness of a tropical
storm came the events of the drama,
which Miss Churchill was never to for
get.
She heard of it first at breakfast. The
army of the rebellion, led by two Eng
lish adventurers, were at the gates of
the old walled town, and even now she
heard the roaring of cannon. She
clapped her hands.
"Why, this will be a jollyâ a real
siege."
"You'll be safe here." said the Consul,
a fair-haired man of 40. He was a
widower, and had felt for some time
that he was sure to fall in love with
this interesting woman.
"Oh, yes, we are quite safe, quite
safe," Lord Rendell said, with perfect
faith In the flag that waved above
him.
"Still, I should like to have an Eng
lish or American ship in the harbor,"
Lady Rendell remarked.
"Why, Mary, they don't do anything;
just run about and shout a great deal.
I have heard all about it," Miss
Churchill put in.
"I have warned the President." said
Forsyth, "and he has a wholesome re
spect for our guns."
"Oh, Louise," Lord Rendell remark
ed. "I was looking over the last Amer
ican paper and I saw the engagement
of that fellow Bates to the little widow.
Funny things, these American 'Society
Notes.' "
Rendell dearly liked to tease his sis
ter-in-law, who said nonchalantly, "Oh,
indeed." but she leaned low over the
coffee.
The cathedral bell began to toll, ac
centuating the roll of guns, while cries
from the street reached them.
"I have much to do,; 1 Forsyth said,
rising; "much. So I must be going.
You all must keep close to the house."
A. servant at this moment appeared
at the door.
"Pardon. Excellency, his Highness,
the President, to see your Excellency."
"Wonder what the old duffer wants
of meâ our protection, perhaps." "
'And he went out to his office, Ren
dell following him. The ladies at the
window saw a little row of soldiers and
the President's carriage.
Presently Rendell returned, all ex
citement.
"Forsyth is acting for Blunt, the
American Consul, in his absence," he
said. "The President doesn't want to
offend us, you may fancy. He has cap
tured three men and purposes to shoot
them because he thinks they are two
Englishmen who are directing Men
dez's army. Now, this is the most ex
traordinary coincidence."
Lord Rendell lacked tact to the su
premest degree. "Do you recognize the
writing?" and he handed Lady Rendell
a piece of dirty paper.
"Let me see," said Miss Churchill,
looking over her sister's shoulder, and
then she grew pale.
"It's very like Kit Bates' writing.
Yes, it's his signature."
"Yes, it is," cried Lady Rendell.
They had read:

f|^HE EARL OF RENDELL was
I one of the globe-trottins race,
I and when, through his marriage
JL with Miss Mary Churchill of New
Tork, his estate was restored, he was
enabled to gTatify to a nicety every
whim In this direction. The Ren
dells went from Dan to Beersheba, and
so it chanced that they turned up Â«t
San Fernandez during those events
that are now a matter of the spas
modic historv of that Central Ameri
can republic. Lady Rendell was ac
companied by her sister. Miss Louise
Churchill, lately engaged to Stephen
Wharton of Baltimore; by his man,
Simpson, and Lady ChurcTiill's maid,
â¢who fell ill of the fever and whose
services were supplemented by those
of a Spanish-American girl called
Gloria- The English Consul at San
Fernandez happened to be at this time
the Right Hon. James Forsyth, who
vas a warm friend of the Earl, and
the party put up at the consulate.
This building faces the cathedral,
dating from the seventeenth century,
and containing some excellent relics of
Epanish colonial times and a very good
organ. That organ woke Miss Church-
UI at dawn and put her to sleep at
Bight. The organist seemed to be al
ways playing and the people always at
their devotions.
San Fernandez is in every way a fine
example of old New Spainâ its streets,
its varied population, its queer little
soldiery, its court, that of the Presi
dent Benor Don Jose Gonzales, who
had established himself through a suc
cessful revolution. Lady Rendell had
met the President's wife in Paris, and
so she called on her, and the Senora
Gonzales was pleased to return the call,
and the ladies saw much of society
In a â¬panish -American capital. Then
they wandered about the place and
collected things.
But Louise Churchill, for reasons of
her own, was not in the best of spirits.
The truth of the matter was that she
had been fond of a certain Christopher
Bates, who had flirted atrociously with
a certain widow, and to spite him she
had engaged herself to Stephen Whar
ton, as is sometimes the way with
young women. At once she found she
had been spiting herself, and she never
felt this eo much as when, coming into
the consulate one day from the cool
recesses of the cathedral, ehe heard
aa ehe entered some passages of the
old comedy.
The girl Gloria was talking to a lit
tle man in a sergeant's uniform, Miss
Churchill understood Spanish very well,
and in narrating this little drama I
will make no distinction between
tongues. She heard the little sergeant:
"Gloria, mine!" (
"Ah, Jose Rubino, was the song un
der my window last night for Ther
esa?"
"The little coquette!" thought Miss
Churchill.
"There are Theresas and Theresas."
Rubino replied, fervently; "but of Glo
rias "
"But one, I suppose," said the girl.
At this Rubino tried to get her hand,
but she pushed him away, and seeing
Miss Churchill she became very de
mure, while Rubino hastened out of
the door.

Promptly he tookâ not the sandwich,

"Isabel!" he exclaimed, his voice
low and significant. "Isabel'."
She was more beautiful than the
girl he " had woed. She had bloomed
out in an atmosphere of luxury, and
in the assured . social position that
had come to her with her marriage.
And he found this new charm im
mensely attractive. He rejoiced that
the hand she have him an instant

her face, were dark with unutterable
reproach. â¢ - Â¦ 7 "- â¢.- 'â¢'

there while ' he raved on. She had

we will go back," she said.

beautiful world.' I am finding- out thatâ
I am happy!" .
He bowed his head over her hand
that she might not see the rapture in
his eyes. And both found the silence
sweet.

They went back toward the town,
oblivious of the two in the shadow of
the boat.
Isabel rose quickly and looked out
over the tumultuous waste of waters.
A fluctuant color was hot in her cheek.
Her eyes were full of a brooding bril

"You heard?" she asked him. "You
knew that was my husband who

He nodded, misunderstanding her
emotion. "If what he said Is true, Isa

She flared out on him then. He would
waitâ he who was not fit to brush the
shoes of that other man whom' he
flouted! That other man whom she
honoredâ whom she loved! She spoke
in no uncertain terms. He quivered
with the merited sting of her disdain.
But he understood at last. And when
she had flung away from him and was
walking rapidly back alone he followed
and caught up with her.

said. And then, lower, "Thank God!"

sight of him into belief that she still

roar of the surf came up to them in
a low, booming, thunderous mono-^

Her wifely pride rose Instantly in

sound of falling tinware and the ob

Bruin ambled away with paws and
jaws sticking full of, the toothsome
contents of the butter tub.
As Bruin's sticky footfalls padded
heavily down the slope, a slow grin
overspread Jack Stanley's face. He
stood up and blew an airy kiss to the
smiling moon. >

ghostly pillars of steam ; which rose
day and night from the geysers and
vent-holes in the Fire Hole Basin

Jack Stanley, sprawled on the thick
carpet of pine needles at her feet,
glanced up half pleadingly, half quiz
zically into the pouting face of the
small autocrat of the camp. "Why
won't you marry me? Your father
wishes it. I have enough."

Just as the huge forepaws reached
out to clasp her In a crushing em
braceâone rasping claw did scratch
her tender arm. the mark of which
she shows proudly to this day â Jack's
gleaming firebrand fell resoundingly
asraln and again i upon the grizzly.
With a roar of pain and a snarl at his
antagonist the great bear released
trembling Nell from his deadly clutch,
and. amid a terrific odor of singeing
h^ir, made for the cooling river a few
yards below. ,
, "Xell, darling, are you hurt?" Jack's
voice was tender with real concern
as he remorsefully wiped the single
red drop which oozed from the dear
arm. She was clasped In a real man's
hug this time and she crept close like
a fluttering, frightened bird into its
neat. Her stubborn litle heart melted
Into : gratitude, admiration and love
and, soon stilled its tumultuous fear
throbs Into a rapturous answer to the
manly one that beat against it.
-Her trembling arms stole about his
neck and her ripe lips met his, drink
ing in the blessed draught of mutual
love and Joy.
"You are a real hero, dear, after
till," she-whispered.
"Then you will marry me, sweet
heart?" the graceless youth asked un
blushingly. The answer went so in
toxicatingly . to, his head that It was

ley had been Infbibihg too freely,
when an hour later, in the strict
privacy of the cook's tent, he thrust
a thousand-dollar bill into " that
worthy's hand with the remark:
"Oh, hl^ng the expense â it's -worth
it!" To his conscience he said: " 'All's
fair in Â¦ love and war* â a primitive
motto."
"She wants a real man, eh? Well,
sweet Mistress Nell has always had
what she wanted, and she mustn't be
disappointed in a little matter of hus
bands:"
He called a servant to put out thÂ»
fire, tucked the guitar under hi3 arm
and strode off to his tent, where ha
slept the dreamless slumber of a gen
eral whose maneuvers are all planned.
The next evening they were all
grouped about the campflre, which had
been replenished, mountain-fashion.
with whole logs drawn and stacked
across its first kindling flame by a
team of horses. The little party,
chaperoned by Nell's mother, who
drowsed on a folding easy chair,
sprawled about the fire, recounting the
day's adventures and the wonders of
the park.
Two or three kodak enthusiasts soon
rose to go to the dark tent to develop
their snap-shots.
"Give us a song, Nell." begged Jack
Stanley, handing her the guitar. "Sing
that old one â old songs are best suited
to things primeval," teasingly. "So
let's . have 'In Days of Old. a Warrior
Bold,' and all the rest of it."
"That's a man's song," retorted tha
girL "But since â " the rest of the
sentence was left to h!3 Imagination,
and Nell bent her bright head over the
beloved instrument and fingered
daintily the stirring accompaniment to
the old ballad. But her eyes were lifted
challengingly to his when she reached
the ringing refrain:
"ITl live for love, I'll live for loveâ
and die!"
Suddenly a deep growl thundered out
of the dense darkness behind them. All
eyes turned startled toward a creat
black mass slowly emerging Into tha
glare of the campflra. Jones and Trent
beat a hasty retreat toward their tent
â to get- their rifles, they explained
eagerly afterward â and every one was
too busy then to remember that all
their weapons had been sealed by the
officials on entering the park.
Mrs. Carter and the other women
shrieked, scattered and fled screaming
to the tents, all but Nell, who was too
paralyzed to move. One white hand
still clung: to the vibrant guitar strings.
Her red lips, now paled with fear, were
still parted, forming frozenly the last
words of her song. Hero was Jack's
chance.
He seized it Instantly, also a red.
burning brand from the fire. With this
weapon he bravely charged the shaggy
animal towering above poor, terror
stricken Nell.

tons this season, to select those that

â¢ for her smartness, has just bought six
possibilities of the small pea.l but
ton, be It in cream color, In brown, in
blue . or in . black. Match your, dress
as - nearly, as you - can and Â¦ place your
button trimmings . to | harmonize, not

In the realm of the large fancy
jeweled button /there is Â¦. something do

as ' J50 each'- and are works of art,
gems fit for } the Jewel case. They are
used' in elaborate tvays as trimmings
and are also employed for button pur
poses. ....
One hands gown has a shoulder
cape which buttons frankly down the
front with. .three handsome jeweled
buttons. These buttons are .of gun

Hints to the Smart Woman.
They are getting up these cloth suits
in a very picturesque way. One lovely
suit worn by Mrs. Clarence Mackay is
a three piece suit in lustrous black
cloth. The skirt is a .round length
with ruffles of taffeta slightly gradu
ated toward the back.
The waist consists of an Eton cut
very low in the ueck and fin.shed with
a deal of nice hand embroidery. The
sleeve3 are half length. And they are
cut pointed and finished with embroid
ery.
Underneath this Is worn a shirt waist
of gray crepe de chine, trimmed with
pipings of gray chiffon and pipings of
black and white. This gown is pretty
as it can be and by no means either
difficult or extravagant.
That is the beauty of so many of
the handsome gowns of the season.
They can be copied at such very light
expense. Often â¢ they can be imitated
simply by skillful remodeling.
One gown which has nothing more
elaborate than a soft black taffeta was
worn out as to the blouse. The suit,
originally a black shirt waist suit, was
worn . in the sleeves and under 'the
arms. The neck was shabby and the
â¢skirt was frayed. Still the style was
good and certain' parts of the suit were
excellent.
the front of her sealskin coat, while in
the early spring they will be used upon
a calling gown of gold colored cloth.
Thus she will more than get back her
money as a button investment.-^
Nearly all the new sleeves 'are full
sleeves. Half sleeves should be cut
very short and' wide, and the prettiest
and newest are cut off above, the elbow.
They" consist of from one to four capes,
each -cape falling over the other and
prettily/ trammed with bands of black
velvet.
To make. these sleeves very little art
is required of the dressmaker, but there
must be a deal of taste expended upon
the finish. They can be cut in points
and elaborately braided or they can be
bordered .with lace, v Or again, one can
take the half sleeve and trim it with
a knife plaited ruffle of cloth or of silk
trimmed with a band of filet insertion.
If you are in doubt how to finish your
nice cloth sleeves do not hesitate any
longer, but cut them off above the
elbow, set them very full into the arm
hole and let them flare well. It would
be no harm to have' a cape sleeve with
one small cap falling over this sleeve
and possibly another.
You will not require a handsome un
dersleeve of the lingerie order, but this
is easily supplied. If you wear a hand
some shirt waist its sleeves can be
made fluffy with lace flounces, while
. the vest can be pulled out Jtn front and
trimmed with lace frills. Such a waist
is extremely pretty and makes a hand
some finish for your cloth suit. -
- Mrs. Clarence Mackay's Suit.
Another summer gown which needed
renovating was In a shade of golden
brown taffeta. This was made new by
narrow bands of black velvet put on
In a way to reinforce the material.
You can do a great deal with bands of
black velvet if you know how to go
at It.
One gown, a black taffeta, was
trimmed with dozens and dozens of
narrow black velvet bands and put on
in groups to indicate a hip yoke and to
make a border for the skirt flounce. If
you are going to use these velvet bands.
buy your black velvet by the bolt, put
it on freely and see that the bands are
not more than half an Inch in width,
with a preference for quarter Inch
widths. In this way you get the smart
touch which will be the making of your
gown.
The Cross-Stltch Girl.
The linen cross-stitch girl is a busy
personage this season, for she has dis
covered her possibilities. Indeed, they
are without limitation. She can take
an old tan linen waist and make It sim
ply gorgeous with her own handicraft,
and she can take an old cloth waist all
out of date and bring it right up to the
mark by adding to it her bands of em
broidery-
This young woman will take strips
of heavy white linen and cut it Into
bands to form panels for the front of
her waist. It takes one wide panel to
go down the middle of the front. Then
she will take a wide strip anil make a
band for the neck. Then she will take
another strip and make an epaulette
fcT the shoulder, carefully measuring
its length. And. finally, she will cut
out deep cuffs and then she is ready to
go to work. All the measurements must
be accurately made.
She will embroider these bands with
the oriental colors, carrying them out,
not in the swinging Japanese style, but
in the little neat Armenian cross stitch.
She will make her waist set in the most
accurate manner, using wash silks.
And, when she has completed her set.
she will work half a dozen squares to
.be set into the sleeves and into the
waist. These squares giva a finishing
touch of elegance.
They take linen in a shade of new
blue and work It in thiS way. And they
take tan colored linen and coffee color
ed linen. Beside this they take linen
that is in the deep brown colors and
upon these dark canvas backgrounds
Making a trip to town this woman
exhibited her navy blue voile to a
dressmaker, who immediately obtained
enough Persian embroidery to border
the three flounces with which the skirt
was trimmed. She also edged the sleeve
ruffles with the Persian. Then she s^-t
bands of Persian around the yoke in
such a manner as to make It a pointed
yoke. She indicated a hip yoke and
she made an epaulette of the Persian
which extended down over the sleeve
and made a sleeve cap.
Finally, as a cap stroke of genius.
she added a stock of crushed white
velvet, chiffon weight, and a girdle of
white chiffon velvet. This made the
gown quite new again and was done at
a comparatively low cost.
quite belle the name. They are not
shirred and they are not worn over
the gown and not under it. One of
these is made of piece-lace cut in yoke
shape with stock attached. To S i ve
the stock its proper shape there is a.
narrow threading of pale blue ribbon
which ties around the throat. The
whole is profusely embroidered i n
oriental stitches.
Probably the greatest improvement
which can be made to an old crown [ s
a local one. A woman having ,1
dress, of navy blue voile, found at th*
middle of the season that it was hope
lessly out of date. It was drng^ie.i
and without stvle. It lacked that
smartness which is necessary in a.
gown.

they embroider or work the design In
red and blue to be used upc-n a dark
red or a dark blue gown.

do better than learn it. The dark seta

Later she will have them transferred to
The owner of this ragged taffeta
shirt waist suit purchased six yards of
thin, soft black taffeta, showing a little
black embroidered dot. And with this
she made a new pair of sleeves, of half
length, opening over white lingerie un
dersleeves. Then she cut out the neck
and made a stock and yoke of the
black dotted goods. And finally, she
sewed a bias band of the same around
the frayed foot of the skirt. The change
was perfect and complete.
. Many an old waist is made new by
the addition of new sleeves and a new
stock, while the worn places under
the arm are reinforced by an invisible
patch out on underneath.
This is particularly the case with
the white shirt waist, which is so soon
thrown aside. The higher the price
the more delicate^ the goods and the
sooner^'it is gone, and unless new
sleeves are put in the waist must be
''thrown away. Such a waist is admir
able as a foundation for the handsome
lingerie shirt waists now needed for
wear with the new. cloth gowns. Put
in sleeves of. dotted muslin or dotted
Swiss and trim the front with ruffles
of the Swiss. A few pearl buttons can
be set down the front as a finish.

The making of the guimpe is a
thing which should not be neglected
by the woman with an old wardrobe

of a social nature. For such occasions
the cream white cloak is by all means
the most elegant and, being all in
Â¦white, one does not tire of it. nor does
it grow monotonous to one's friends.
A handsome cloak was recently made
for a fashionable woman of Gotham
whose taste in dress is supreme. , Its
material" is a line grade of chiffon
broadcloth. Its trimming consists of
bands of white liberty satin and rows
and rows of Valenciennes lace. .Its lin
ing is India silk. This cloak, v.-hile it
ib by no means 'cheap, will wear a long
time and be elegant on every occasion.
To make a cloak really dressy the
lace should be put on in little frills to
give thÂ» bouffant effect which is re
quired this season. There can be frills
down the front of the cloak, frills
around the yoke and rows and rows
of lace frills upon the sleeves.
A great many women put off the buy
ing of a handsome three-quarter cloak,
thinking it one of the unnecessary lux
uries of the wardrobe, a something for
the wealthy woman only.
Yet, if the woman who wants to
dress well will purchase a nice cloak,
selecting pongee, taffeta, fine cloth or
crepe de chine, she will find herself
well repaid for her, investment. Worn
with a lingerie shirt waist and a hand
some skirt this cloak will, in itself,
make an elegant appearance and will
take the place of a handsome costume
of cloth, lace, velvet' or satin. And it
will be strictly the vogue.
Getting Back to Satin. .
There is no doubt that the fashion
world is moving backward and that,
in its backward progress, It has
reached the safin stage. Black satin,
heavy and lustrov "nd black satin of
chiffon weight, glossy and soft, will
both be in style, as will all the inter
mediate grades of satin.
It Is going to be a fall when the
grande dame will have a handsome
satin gown in her wardrobe and "when
she will brine it out and put it on for
her best -occasions. She will have it
made up in the most elaborate manner,
'.and she will trim it with the finest old
lace in her treasure u -ik.
But, though satin has been revived,
it will be trimmed in new ways. Black
satin and Spanish lace will be worn as
they were In days of yore, but black
satin will also be linked to lace of less
illustrious pedigree. The string and the
ecru laces, the imitation vals and the
odd and coarse imitation Irish crochet
laces will 'all 'be worn upon the hand
somest of black satin calling costumes.
One lovely gown, made for a young
matron of society, is a black satin with
sweeping skirt all laid in box plaits
upon a plain black satin hip yoke. The
skirt is trimmed '.with- a wide band of
-filet lace put on at about the height of
the knees. "The waist is an Eton with
open front and short sleeves over, a
black lace shirt waist, the lace being
of the heavy string "variety. .
Nor is it the matron alone who has
fallen under the magic spell of the
lustrous and aristocratic stuff. Even
the debutantes are gorgeous in gowns
of b.lack satin made gay with pipings
of a bright shade and with dyed or
ecru lace to simulate a cape.-
One dear little debutante has a

order. The skirt is a round length.

fct)Ics of the Between Season Girl

By AUGUSTA PRESCOTT.
*^1 L1VAYS well dressed is the
f I President's daughter, and. in
Â£ I the dash to see her, the public
1 is rewarded by a glimpse of a
grown v.hlch, while not extreme, is al
ways In the best of style.
One of Miss Roosevelt's new coats
is a Urns' loose driving coat of em
broidered pongee. Its color is, a cran
berry red and its sleeves are finished
by deep cuffs of open embroidery in
cranberry color. There is a wide
sailer collar of the English or eyelet
embroidery and the back and the front
of the coat hang full and straight to a'
three-quarter length.
The pongee coat threatens to be
vcrn all summer and to hold its vogue
over through the fall. It is as glossy
as sathi and can scarcely be distin
guished from that material. As to its
lining (here are innovations to be
noted), the best of the new pongee
three-quarter coats are lined with
white Futin, treated as elegantly 33
though the coat were for opera wear.
The three-quarter pongee coat, lined
with white satin, is a very handsome
garment end one which any woman
may be proud to own. It can be worn
nearly all the year round and- will last
as long as there is a thread of the
pongee left and everybody knows that
this material is practically indestruc
tible.
A really e!ejjant garment is a pongee
coat in turquoise blue, trimmed with
string lace of the same shade. The
lace is narrow and is used as a frill
for the sleeve and shoulder ruffles,
while across th(j front a wider band
of the same lace outlines the yoke and
gives a cape effect.
For the woman who has no use for
- turquoise blue coat there is the pon
gee coat in pearl white. This can be
trimmed with pipings of the same ma
terial and- with a very little Valen
ciennes lace dyed a pearl color. This
cloak la useful any time of the year,
for it is the fashion now to wear white
and light cloaks winter and summer.
Then, besides the pongees, which are
by far the most serviceable of all long
cloaks, there come very fine light cloths
which make up beautifully. One cloak
of very light weight cloth was in a
shade of navy blue, that color of which
we never tire. This coat, which was
very nearly a full length, was trimmed
with bands of navy blue taffeta, with
each band outlined with -a piping of
â¢white satin. This makes a very effect

Those who want a cloak that will do
for the matinee girl and even for the

THREE QUARTER
COAT
10club is open to the public. It was built
at the suggestion of the many sports
men who hav\: heretofore had to camp
in that locality.
In" the same section of the country is
Lake Tahoe, one of the finest fresh
water fishing grounds in the United
States. Trout of the gamest kind "are
to be taken from its waters. It is
really an ideal place.
Taking one of the fishing steamers
early in the- morning, it is but a few
hundred yards before trolling lines are
cast and the fun begins. Under the
shade of the awning one can fish until
the noon hour.
If the trolling line does not appeal
to the sportsman he can rig up his
rod and line with a couple of trailers,
that is, two small trolling spoons, and
play for the big fish. When he gets a
strike the skiff in which he Is fishing
from the steamer is cast off and he
can play his game to his heart's de
sire, for a sood-sized .trout on Tahoe
Is not the easiest thing in the world
to land with a light rod.
Then comes the noonday meal of
fish. Who would not travel miles for
Just such a feast?
The steamer is tied up to one of the
landings around the lake and you go
ashore, where a fire is built and the
frying panÂ«is put on. When it la hot
about a roll of butter is melted and
next comes the bacon, which is fried
to a crisp. By this thne the fish have
been taken out of the cage, killed and
cleaned and are ready for the pan.
In a few minutes they are served and
you start eating, and how you do eat,
in the clear air of the high Sierras!
There are lots of other good things
spread on the ground, but they do not
appeal to you as does the trout. You
eat until you can eat no more. Then
comes a good cigar and a quiet nap
under a shady tree and' then you are
ready for the afternoo- sport of more
fishing. The results of your catch you
will have boxed up and expressed to
your friends, who are not as fortunate
as you in visiting Tahoe.
While at Tahoe one can make a trip
to "White Cloud and Fallen Leaf lakea
and cet some very good fishing. The
fish do not run as large as on the big
lake, but yet it is sport. Back of these
lakes may be found bear and other
game, i? one has the hunting habit.
Another sportsman's paradise for the
more blase fishermen is Big Meadows,
which calls for a more extended trip,
but if you have the time it will pay
for the trouble.
Yet another place that i3 attracting
the sportsmen of the coast la the
southern part of Oregon, where both
fish and game are to be found in great
numbers. It Is in that section that
the Japanese pheasant is to be found
in numbers. It is a trip for a vaca
tion where a person has at least a
week at his - t command. Any place
over the border lire will furnish sport.
There is another kind of fishing
which, although it does not appeal so
strongly to those who live on the coast,
does appeal to those of the interior.
It is fishing for salmon. This is one
cf the # best sports of Central Call-
At Monterey and Santa Cruz is to
be found the finest salmon fishing in
the world. Even the north can not
compare with it for the pleasure to
b<? enjoyed at the California resort3.
This is no dainty sport like trout
fishing. It calls for a good, strong
arm and considerable endurance to
land these fish. Fcr no sooner are they
hooked than they commence to show
a fight which is fierce until the last
death struggle. But when you land
a salmon you have a fish you can
well be proud of.
If rafcicn seems too small one ha3
only to proceed farther south around
Point Conception into the Santa Bar
bara Channel, and off Catalina Island
the jewf.ish ami the tuns.â the latter of
which challenges the tarpon of Flor
ida for gameness â is here to be found.
This is undoubtedly the acme of fish
ing, for skill and endurance onlv land
ttm'a prize. The game has become so
pop::iar*that a Tuna Club has been
formed and prizes are annually given.
But there ia another part of tfce Stata
of California which is being opened
up as the perfect paradise for sports
men, and that is in the Kings River
Canyon country. One to enjoy the
pleasures cf this section must go pre
pared for a camping trip, for pack
mules have to be used to carry what
ordinarily can be transported .--'by
wagon.
It is a great game country, for every
thing can be found in this canyon,
from the bear to the grouse and quail,
while the streams are full of fish.
Then, there ia a certain loneliness
caused by the grandeur of the moun
tains that giver, one a rest that noth
ing else can do. The scenery chal
lenges that of Yosemite.
It is a question if the sportsman will
have this pleasure very long. The Gov
ernment may take this region up for
a park, or else it will be overrun with
tourists who are hunting after the
beautiful. But at the present time it
is the place of all places for the sports
man with the rod and gun. Califor
nia cannot offer anything better.
There has been splendid fishing re
ported from Sterling City, up in Butt*
County. A new railroad has been con
structed to this point and many of the
red experts are up there this year. Go
where will, north or south, and no
matter how small the stream Is. you
will find fishing that will pay you for
your trouble. One of the many places
that can b? mentioned where fish can
be found are Arroyo Honda, Waddell,
Big Creek, Capitola. Packards, Stevens
Creek. Pescadero. I^agunitas, Sims and
the upper Sacramento.
If a person has never fished any of
these streams, just try them once and
bee what fishing is in California.
"Although the dog's teeth were sunk
deep in the bear's flesh, the bear didn't
stop or waver in his ascent, but climb
ed on as if nothing at all was worrying
him. Yap held on, game dog that he
was, determined that his adversary
wasn't going to give him the slip in
that way. And the higher the bear
climbed the tighter the dog gripped
and the harder he tugged to make him
come down. By and by Yap was swing
ing in the air, fifteen feet above the
ground.
"This wassa better circus than old
man French had 'counted on after all
and he roared and laughed until he
tumbled off the stump.
"When the bear had climbed the low
er branches of the tree he stopped,
looked back over his shoulder at Yap
where he was swinging and tugging at
the other end of the bear and then he
let go his hold on the tree. He came
down like a pile driver. When he
struck bottom Yap was between him
and the ground.
"There was one faint yelp, and that
was all. Three hundred pounds of bear
had flattened out forty pounds of dog
out of all shape. The catastrophe was
eo sudden that before old man French
could recover from - the effects of the
unexpected climax the bear had lifted
the bear merely shuffled away to a lit
tle piece of open chestnut limber near
by and turned to wait for Yap. Old
man French wasn't only surprised. He
was sorry for the bear, for he believed
it must surely be a strange bear in
those woods, unacquainted with Yap.
"Yap began his maneuvers to uncov
er the bear's tactics, but the bear, to
the dog's evident surprise and to the
disgust of old man French, made only
a few feeble passes at Yap and then
turned and began tp shin up a trc'i.
The dog got over his surprise before
his master got over his disgust suffi
ciently to reach for his gun and as the
bear, moving /without any show of
haste, raised* clear of .the ground tm
his way up .the tree. Yap made a
spring and closed his jaws tight on one
of the beast's hams. Â»
f{ Y BELIEVED then and I be
j lieve yet," said a Potter County
J[ man, "that what the bear did
was a fully premeditated act,
deliberately and successfully carried
out as planned, although old man
French insisted until the day he died
that it whs entirely an accident, refus
ing to believe that a bearâ even a Pot
ter County bear â could be smart
enough to get the'best of his dog Yap
"That dog Yap was a smart one,
iand no mistake. He was the greatest
bear dog that old man French ever
had, and he had owned some famous
ones, being himself the greatest bear
hunter the Kettle Creek country
boasted; and great bear hunters were
almost tig thick in the Kettle Creek
country in those days as the bears
were. And. that dog Yap was as well
known to the tears as he was to the
hunters.
"Bears hate dogs beyond everything
else, and will frequently give up the
chance of getting away from the pur
suing hunter just for the satisfaction^
of waiting for the dog that is yelping
on the trail behind them and taking
a fall out of him when he comes up.
And particularly did the Kettle Creek
bears hate old man French's dog Yap,
for they had found out that waiting to
take a fall out of him always resulted
in the coming to grief of the bear thus
waiting to take the fall, none of them
having been able to put up even a
show of successful fight against him;
consequently all their efforts to get the
best of Yap having failed, they had
taken to giving him a wide berth and
kept right on going when they found
that he was on their track. ,
"Such being the case, old man
French' couldn't help being surprised
the day he and Yap routed that big bear
out of the laurel patch, not far from
the mouth of the Little Kettle, when
himself oft what was left of Yap, cast
a cc-ntfcmptuous glance at the late dog's
master and waddled oK and "out of
sight in the iaurels.. .
"There never was a smarter bear dog
than old man French's . x Yap and there
never was a deader one than he was
when that bear got off him. And I
believed then, as I believe yet, that
what the bear did was a premeditated
act. deliberately and successfully car
ried out as planned, but old ., man
French would never have it that way."

THE sportsmen of this State, es
pecially the followers cf the rod
and line, do not appreciate what
they have in the way of pleas
ure. Within a couple of hours*
after leaving their office or home th^y
may be on many a pleasant stream
fishing. If they have the time to spare
they can go even farther and make
more oretentious catches. But in
every case good sport Is to be found
and the fish are to be had in num-.
bers. Those who fish and have put
off their vacation until this month can
look for splendid sport on the moun
tain streams. The high water of last
spring has put the streams in splendid
condition for fishing. From now until
the last of August there will be sport
galore, as the water is receding slowly.
One can cast a fly on the upper Sac
ramento, where the sport is fair at
the present time, or he may take to
the McCIoud River. Good sport may
be had at the Klamath Hot Springs,
where many favorable catches have
beer, reported.
The Rogue and McKenzie rivers in
Southern Oregon are in splendid con
dition, plenty of fish baing taken,
especially near Gold Hill on the Rogue
River. Many letters have been re
ceived from fishermen at Webber and
Independence Lake, telling of fine
Â¦...Â¦:Â¦Â¦
. sport.
The Big Basin, near Boulder Creek,
and the other streams about Boulder
have been the scene of many fine
catches this year. It is fishing like
this that gives those who live in Cali
fornia the advantage over their breth
ren in other States, especially those
on the Atlantic Coast.
To set anything like a decent catch
in the East one has to spend a day
at lea-t in travel. Even an afternoon
on San Francisco "Bay will make the

to be dainty at all times and trust the
directions given may be helpful to you.

HINTS FOR THE DYSPEPTIC
(Marion)â A person suffering from in
digestion should never drink freely of
ice water cither with or between meals,
as it lowers the temperature of the
stomach and retards digestion. In the
morning when you feel so distressed
do not eat breakfast as soon as you
are up, but wait an hour. Occupy the
intervening time with some light ex
ercise and take half a pint of hot water
to rid the stomach of poisonous mucus
which has accumulated during the
night. The moment you are up take the
hot water, adding a few drops of lemon
juice to make It more palatable. In
a short time you will be able to take
it clear and increase the quantity to
a pint. You will find this wonderfully
helpful in cleansing the stomach. Next
massage over the stomach and ab
domen for ten minutes, using the hands
in a firm rotary pressure. If a roller
is used roll from right to left, reverse
and then up and down until the entire
surface has been covered several times.
It will give great relief.

S. I. L. (Bleaching Hair).â No, you
misunderstood me about .the,, lemons.
I did not mean with the peroxide, but
by themselves in the rinsing water.
I would try that now and then instead
of using so much peroxide, for it is a
bleach in itself and a very harmless
one at that. You have been using too
much ammonia in the peroxide and
that has told on your hair. Try two
or three tablespoonfuls of ammonia in
the usual amount of peroxide and you
will find it will serve quite as well.
And if you possibly, can, sit in the sun
while it is drying. That' gives a glossy
look and it will also serve as a bleach
in itself. Besides it is a splendid tonic
and If you can manage to give your
hair a sun bath it will do it more good
than a course of treatment. .
Here is a splendid skin food:
White wax 1 ounce
Spermacetti 1 ounce

Sweet almond oil 4 ounces
Cocoanut oil 2 ounces

MRS. C. J. B. (Musical Voice).â You
most certainly can train' your voice, but
it is going to take time and faithful
practice. However, it is well worth
the' energy and time expended. In the
first place, all sweet voices are low and
soft, and you can pitch yours to prac
tically suit yourself. Try speaking
first in a high key and then in a low
one. Really one cannot help you, for
it all depends entirely with yourself,
but when you have 'the house to your
self hold an animated conversation
with anything you may be working
upon and see the various keys 'that
you can use. Another thing, remember
and never speak loudly, for that in
itself frequently, makes the voice harsh
and stringent. If people do not hear
you, move nearer them, but persist in
speaking evenly and slowly, and. I am
certain that you will acquire as pleas
ing a voice as any one.
BROWN EYES (Brown Spots).â I am
sorry to say there is nothing t**w*\
than peroxide. I wonder if you have
used It full strength and if you have
put any ammonia with it. Do not be
discouraged but keep right on, for there
i3 no more powerful bleach, and if any
thing will remove that dark spot, per
oxide will. Now about those scars:
Again I am afraid, nothing will help
you. Where the flesh has been dis
figured it is difficult to patch it out
and make it look fresh without an op
eration, and even then it is frequent
ly a dismal failure. But really I would
not worry over those, for these days
every one wears such dainty, fluffy
neckwear that you can keep them cov
ered very nicely. If you want to wear
evening gowns buy sf heavy beaded
collar that is some two ' and a half
Inches high and wear that. It is not
only fashionable but very pretty and
vastly becoming to the majority of
people. If I hear of a good bleach I
will let you know, so glance over the
answers in order not to miss it.

WEAK FEET AND ANKLES (Mrs.
N. M. H.)â The trouble of which you
complain is common to women whose
walking is largely confined; to smooth
floors. So little exertion is necessary
that the. muscles of the feet become
flabby and lacking in firmness arid con
trol/ hence when subjected only- oc
casionally to sudden twists, prolonged
pressure and other effects incident to
walking over paved streets or country
roads, the weakness is manifest in
blisters and a painful sense of strain.
Again, the habitual wearing of , very
snug shoes, which hold the muscles
perfectly rigid all day, causes them to
become Weak, losing elasticity, and not
responding to the extra strain brought
upon them without fatigue. Shoes
which are comfortably large will do
more to relieve the torture of corns
and bunions and strengthen the feet
by allowing room to expand and the
muscles to assert themselves than any
amount of local treatment in the way
of applications. In fact, little can real
ly be done to cure the .trouble until the
pressure Is removed which causes cal
loua growths and weakness. Last, but
by -V, t:<c^e\a h*v.if perfect cleanliness
a&v. toi*.c baths are essential. The lat
ter are particularly restful when the
feet are very sensitive, but you can
not -expect immunity from pain and
weakness until, by careful exercise, you
have strengthened the muscles. This
is most readily accomplished by a reg
ular dally walk in broad shoes of com
fortable length. They should be loose
enough to permit you to draw the feet
as well as the toes backward and for
ward easily. A simple exercise which
will strengthen the muscles of the feet,
ankles and legs Is to stand erect and
rise slowly upon the toes, coming down
lightly on the heels. Repeat until the
muscles are tired. At first it may be
tiresome after four or five efforts, but
persistent repetition will soon give
strength and endurance, then you will
be able to repeat the exercise twenty
times and do it several times a day.
Use the following excellent liniment
freely on the feet and ankles after ex
ercise and long walks to relieve sore
ness and pain: One half ounce each of
spirits of turpentine, oil of hemlock,
oil of cedar arid gum camphor to five
ounces of the best alcohol. ' Keep tight
ly corked and when using it rub in
thoroughly.

POINTS OF PHYSICAL, CULTURE
(Vera). â The sensible girl will under
stand that athletics do not stand for
unlady-like liberty, but a control of the

pretext of being athletic have become
loud and boisterous. This is the fault
of the individual and not of the train

GRANULATED EYELIDS (Betty)â
Eyelids which are constantly fringed
Â»vith a crust of dandruff or grandula
tions are not in a -healthy condition,
and some treatment stronger than
"frequent bathing in clear water" Is
necessary to rid the lids of the disfig

lids undoubtedly exists and must be
overcome. The demands upon the sight
are so varied that few escape a chronic
state of Inflammation in a low degree,
which may manifest itself In redness
of the eyeballs or of the lids only, but
by regular and intelligent treatment
the trouble can usually be alleviated
by simple means. If the trouble is se

steadily increasing, then lose no time in
consulting a competent oculist, for un
der no circumstances is home treat
ment advisable. inflammation is
present, even in a low degree, it is
easily discovered in a strong light by
a close examination before a mirror.
You will observe that the network of
tiny veins which traverse the mem
branous lining of the lids are very red
and clearly defined; in a healthy state
they are hardly discernible. Bathe the
eyelids with clear, tepid water, holding
It on with a soft cloth, well saturated,
until the granulation is released. Then

Now that shops have imported lace
makers and skilled workers in linen the
girl who has plenty of money to spend
is In clover. All her lingerie bears her
monogrdm and perhaps a crest. Not
the smallest trifle is forgotten and her
dainty cobweb handkerchiefs are truly
things of beauty. When she arrives at
the state of furnishing her house she
walks into a f>hop, looks extremely
wise as she makes her selections of va
rious linens and monograms and then
goes serenely on her way, knowing full
well that all the supplies will be deliv
ered in duo time ready for use. Fancy
what a tremendous satisfaction them
must be In that! But on the other
hand,, think of the satisfaction that
comes from the* knowledge that all the
pretty, useful articles were made by
yourself and that every stitch was
sewed firmly down with bits of senti
ment and castle building. And of the
two, which would you?
THERE la a new wrinkle in mark
ing linen that serves the busy
housewife decidedly well and
that fairly delights the heart of
the girl who is intent on stocking her
dower chest. Instead of blocking in
the letters and then working them over
and over until she fairly sees double
and has von a reputation for being
a cross patch, she serenely puts on her
daintiest frock and her most becoming
hat and marches herself straightway
downtown on a shopping bee. Once
there she invests in a liberal supply
of finished initials that are all ready
to be appliqued on. and lo and behold,
her troubles are more than half over.
The woman who has not served her
apprenticeship at embroidering, espe
cially initials, even though they be over
papier mache foundations, may smile
to herself and think that there is much
ado about nothing:, but give her even
so small a task as a dozen napkins
and she speedily changes her mind.
For some reason or other this sort of
work is especially tiresome and the
very monotony of working: dozens and
dozens of pieces has a tendency to
make one hate the chest and all the
dainty things that have been so care
fully laid away in it.
Of course, these letters all ready to
sew on are not appropriate for all man
ner of things, but nevertheless they
are a decided comfort and a great con
venience as well. Towels, especially in
. outfits, come not less than five dozens,
and five times twelve makes just about
sixty initials that may be put on in
two or three days, whereas it would
take a few weeks to embroider them
and a great deal of time and strength
in the bargain. Sheets and pillow
clips, tea cloths and, in fact, all house
hold supplies, excepting, of course,
table linen, may be neatly and service
ably marked in this fashion and will
do quite as well as the handwork to
all intents and purposes.
These little inexpensive treasures
are one of the best things that a bride
to-be can possibly invest in, for when
the has a thousand and one things to
do at one and the same time, she
doesn't know which way to turn first.
And brides, by the way, generally
make the mistake of storing their
chest with absoultely everything that
they can possibly think of. They pack
away sets and sets of everything in
lavender and occasionally permit some
favored friend to "come and see"
while the lady plumes herself and
thinks she has done something re
markably fine. And then what hap
pens? Unless 'she is to be mistress of a
large house, her pretty things stay in
the chests and slowly but surely grow
old with age. Sweet scented, to be
sure, but undeniably yellow.
If she Is a practical little woman out
they all come and a good tubbing
makes them look quite iike .new, but
after all what's the use ot having more
than can be used comfortabl*?
Besides this there is another side to
the question. After her ladyship has
had time to stop and breathe she sud
denly wakes up to the fact that she is
so tired she can scarcely see straight.
â so tired she hardly knows what the
matter is with herself. She is cross.
She is peevish. She Is scandalously
thin- But the outfit is finished and
she takes comfort in that blessed fact
That may be very fit and fine, but in
these days of practicability It is scarce
ly a paying proposition to reduce one's
eelf to a shadow. And for such a poor
cause, too. Undoubtedly, all linen
should be marked, but there are ways
and ways of doing: it and life is too
short for one to become a slave to
household duties.
A pood style for ordinary towels is
the rlain initial worked on a bit of
linen that in turn is finished heavily
m the ends. They look a little as
though they had been buttonholed and
as though each little placÂ£ for the
thread had been finished for that one
thread alone. And, of a truth, that Is
about the facts of the case. Sewing
these on is the simplest matter In the
world, for when each little hole is duly
attended to the trick is finished.
For a better grade towel there are
fancier initials and quite a bit larger
as well. The linen is finished with a
number of fancy frills and furbelows
that look very pretty but that require
somewhat of a knack to applique on
well. The little edges that resemble
French embroidery are not supposed
to be tacked securely in place, and in
all probability would look more flower
like and more attractive if they were
permitted to stand up jauntily, but the
pretty effect is entirely ruined If they
are sent to the regulation laundry. The
dainty edges seem intent on making
the acquaintance of the sharpest point
of the iron and if they are sent home
without a frayed end and a number of
broken stitches one may consider it a
bit of good luck.
A far better scheme is to take a
stout thread and as fine a needle a3
will carrr it and make small, round
stitches all the way about the linen,
taking care not to miss a space large
enough to hold the thread. Forty
thread is not too coarse and it is strong
enough to withstand the ravages of the
tub for many a long day.
Sheeting requires a letter that comes
especially for it, and the size depends
entirely upon the state of the ex
chequer. The ordinary one Is about
two and a half inches long and is rath
er plainly finished, but the more elab
orate one is a trimming in itself. In
the first place it is some five inches
long, too large for anything else. The
linen is exquisitely embroidered and is
made of very fine linen, so that
the finished sheet is most attractive.
And sheets, by the way, are being
more trimmed every day. The thrifty
housewife who prided herself on her
supplies used to consider herself in
clover if all .her sheets and pillow cases
v. ere hemstitched. That was about the
nicest way to finish bedding and she
found time to provide herself with a
few for the guest's chamber at any
rate. But these days she needs some
thing even more elaborate and more
betrimmed. The finest sheets display a
heavy border of flowers, a heavy spray
of leaves or even some conventional de
sign, but the simpler ones are content
with a pretty piece of embroidered in
sertion, and, of course, the cases are
made to match. All widths and all
patterns are used, even to the finest
quality, but when a particularly dainty
flowery design is utilized, the sheeting
is not cut out underneath, unless one
has absolutely no regard for one's
pocketbook.
Breakfast napkins are the only ones
that may be marked with these ap
pliqued initials, and then, they, by the
,way, must be of an entirely different
variety. Unfortunately they come In
but one size and always in a plain let
ter that is not surrounded by linen
that shows decidedly and distinctly
that it is appliqued rather than em
broidered. They have but one fault
and that is if they are not beautifully
put on they look infinitely worse than
none at all, so it behooves one to make
the neatest of stitches.
Even in so small a thing as marking
linen there are always some changes
that one should pay attention to. For
instance, towels are not marked In the
corners any longer. Instead, the letter
is placed in the center of an end and
then it depends entirely upon the finish
of the towel itself. The 'hemstitched
ones usually have the letter about two
Inches above the hem, but the damask
effects have them farther away than
that.
Tea cloths and the like for kitchen
wear may be marked in a variety of
ways, but the newest and most satis
factory method is to order the entire
name worked in red in small pieces of
tape. This, of course, is machine work,
but it is neat and very serviceable and
plenty good enough. These little let
ters come In. a variety of sizes and
shapes and there certainly is no gain
saying the fact that it is a splendid
scheme to have these smaller : articles
labeled plainly and with the full name,
for Jane Smith. does, not run many
chances of losing them in the laundry,
and in this way a generous supply will
last for years and years.
Again, one may order a simple red
initial or a red monogram, but they are
absolutely plain and never come larger
than what is known as the "inch size."
That is,. of course, unless one is willing
to pay a fancy price for such an order,
and then all is plain sailing.

Leading ..physicians have admitted
publicly that the old theory of cutting
the hair ' of fever patients has long
since Â¦exploded and is now rarely prac

profession. "While every one has more
or less knowledge, gained from experi

comparatively few know how to treat

there are cases where it seems almost
impossible to prevent .great loss of
hair, yet, on the other hand, careful
arid prompt treatment will oftentimes
have a most beneficial result and save
the patient that distressing "recon

read the word "mother." Looking at
that chin he knows that it will never
wrinkle petulantly at the refusal of a
new bonnet, that It will never grow
hard and cruel with angry fits of tem

moments of trial, that from the lips
above it only kisses and kind words
and fairy stories can come. The girl
with the Madonna chin Is the ideal
combination of sweetheart and wife,
cook and companion, sentiment and
senseâ that only one man in a thou
sand ever gets. She is the real goddess
Madonna chin speaks for itself. Its
attributes do not have to be described.
They are all written right out upon
the girl's face. Looking at a girl with
the Madonna chin a man can see past
her into long, quiet, sunny years. The
very tilt of her chin seems to spell
"home," the very curve of her throat
was made for kisses. In the set of her
lips a lover can see a perfectly, ordered
house. In the turn of her cheek he can
His money will flow like water down
hill, but he will get a good time for it.
If he is rich his wife will make him
poor in short order; but if he is poor
she will not mind it In the least, but
will live quite as happily on a little
love, a little poetry and bread and tea.
If he is young she will inspire him,
and if he is old she will rejuvenate
him. If he is bad tempered she will
keep him cheerful and if he is buoy
ant she will help him make merry.
In short, nobody would think of call
ing her "a good wife," but she makes
an Ideal "sweetheart," and that is
what most men really want beside
them through life.
If he had his choice in feminine
chins, perhaps every man who ; is
thinking of getting married would in
variably pick out a girl with the Ma
donna chin, that Indescribably sweet
chin, all curves, no angles and with a
deep horizontal cut Just beneath the
lower lip. Such a girl Is as safe an
Investment as Government bonds. The
The man who marries the girl with
no chin at all will never be able to
decide whether he is glad or sorry
that he did it- In the morning when
he is gulping down a cup of cold and
sloppy coffee and trying to find his
hat under a mass of newspapers, books
and umbrellas In the. hall, he will softly
curse fate that he ever saw the woman
seated opposite him in all the glory
of curl papers and a soiled satin kim
ona. But In the evening when he
comes home tired and austy from the
office, to be met with a kiss and a
song on a vine-clad piazza, with roses
growing all about It, ne will wonder
why he ever was discontented. On the
first of the month, when he finds that
there is not enough money in the bank
to meet the bills, a deep sympathy for
himself will spring up in his heart;
but the next evening, wnen she tells
him by the light of the moon that she
used the money to help a poor old lady
and bought a present for his mother
and took a lot of flowers to the hospi
tal, he will kick himself for his own
meanness. He will live In a constant
atmosphere of poetry, roses, sachet
powder, debts, dirt, dust and dreams.
He will never be able to find a clean
collar, a whole 'Bock or a waist
coat with the buttons all on
It; but he will always be allowed
to smoke his pipe in any room in the
house, put his feet 'on the satin parlor
chairs, and go to an Astor ball in his
bathrobe, if he chooses.
There is a type of woman who has
no chin at all. The lower part of her
face Is merely a gentle slope with a
turn in to the throat. Her sweetheart
might gaze at her fondly for seven
evenings out of the weeK without ever
being made aware of the presence of
her chin; and yet, that gentle slope is
a most wonderful index to her charac
ter. It Is the keynote to a penny novel
full of sentiment. It is the sentimental
chin.
with just 10 cents car fare and a lunch
bun in your pocket. She will know all
your opinions and most of your senti
ments before you have uttered them;
she will pick out your acquaintances,
select your pastimes and choose your
reading matter for you. As her chin .
becomes more pointed her remarks will
become more pointed; as her chin gets
sharper her tongue will get sharper; as
her curves become angles her sugges
tions will become commands. There will
be plenty of starch In your shirts and
your waistcoats, but there won't be
much starch left In you. Your house
will be run on an economical plan, but
you will never get enough to eat. Your
money will be carefully saved, but you
won't get any of it. Your household
will be beautifully ordered, but you will
do none of the ordering. In short, if
you want a prop instead of a pillow, a
better half instead of a weaker half, a
commander instead of a lieutenant,
pick out the girl with a firm chin
above her collar line, and blame no
body but yourself. You will go through
life like a novice taking a spin In an
automobile beside an expert chauffeur.

HINTS FOR STOUT FOLK (Marie).
When a woman is hungry all the
time and is constantly Increasing in
weight, It should be self-evident that
she is eating too heavily. Begin at
once to rigidly enforce self-control if
you hope to keep within bounds as to
size. Very healthy persons w J hose di
gestion Is perfect undoubtedly feel hun
ger acutely and are inclined to eat
more than Is wise or needful with the
idea in mind that they need It or be
cause it tastes good. Such people lose
sight of the fact that a morbid appe
tite for food can be created and in
creased by over-indulgence Just as is
the case with liquor, and that eventu
ally overburdened nature will exact a
penalty In a superabundance of flesh
or. It may be, in some serious organic
trouble. To eat three heavy meals
each day with glasses of milk at night,
and then walk a mile daily to reduce
flesh Is about as effective as feeding
a fire with a generous hand and then
trying to extinguish the increasing
blaze with a puny stream of water. I
repeat, self-control Is the first requisite
in reducing flesh. By all means take
the exercise, but curb your appetite.
VENTILATION- AT NIGHT <& B.
L.) â A delicate person finds it almost
impossible to admit sufficient air into
the chamber at night without catching
cold if the window is kept open after
retiring. A much better way of ven
tilating the sleeping room, admitting
plenty of air without distressing re
sults. Is to change the air before re
tiring and then by leaving the window
open a few Inches it will keep quits
pure all night. For an hour or two
before retlrlns have opposite windows
open and If possible an equal distance
from the top and bottom, and thus
permit the fresh air to rush in. ThÂ«
room may seem cold, but the air will
prove all the more invigorating to tired
nerves. Shut off the heat partially,
and, depend upon it. you will feel 50
per cent better the next morning.
REST AFTER SHOPPING (C. M.
L.) â After a busy day spent in shop
ping or in social duties, when every
nerve is tingling from the strain which
exacting duties demanded, do not at
tempt to go through an evening In this
jaded state. Bathe the hands and face
and sponge with some cooling toilet
vinegar, yiip on a kimona and give
yourself up to an hour of complete
rest before dressing for dinner, if it is
in any way possible. If you can catch
a few moments of sleep during this
resting period, all the better. The very
act of undressing will in itself be re
freshing. The tired muscles and flesh,
held in by close bands about the waist,
will have a chance to relax and this
will prove wonderfully restful. A quick
sponge bath and an alcohol rub down
is another lnvigorator which is well
worth trying. After this little care of
yourself put on your prettiest gown
and if your husband unexpectedly
brings a friend home to dine you may
feel as serene as only a well gowned
and refreshed woman can feel. It Is
a duty every woman owes herself and.
her family to be at her very best at
the evening meal, when the toil and
fret of the day ir; laid aside. Encour
age evcrj' member of the family to co
operate in this plan and they will soon
learn to look forward to this hour as
the beginning of all good things rather
thantha end. Family dinners are too
often a failure simply because there Is
little or no effort made to keep the
conversation In a pleasant channel; If
then* is a grievance it is sure to be
ventilated, a thing which should not
be tolerated. In h!3 inimitable man
ner Thackeray speaks of the company
dinner and how "the house assumes a
neat,. jovial, snug appearance, not vis
ible at other seasons." Why cannot
this fame state of pleasure be main
tained when the family is alone? l 1 It
is worth wondering over.
SEWING BY LAMPLIGHT (J. V. S.).
Why the doing of needlework in mod
eration and ill health are synonymous
I cannot imagine unless the worker Is
careless as to her lights. Long evenings
can be passed pleasantly and profitably
In sewing If the conditions are favor
able, otherwise it Is a case of burning
the candle at both ends. First of all.
a clear, steady light is essential, and
the more tthe better; it should be shad
ed so that the full rays will fall di
rectly upon the work in hand, for this
relieves the eyes of any strain incident
to a glare. Flickering gas is perhaps
the poorest and most trying of all
lights, unless it be an unshaded electric
bulb, which is simply ruinous to sight.
The best of all lights for night work
Is the good, old-time lamp, well filled
with kerosene oil. the well-trimmed
blaze covered by an immaculate chim
ney and shaded by an opaque white
porcelain shade. I am fully aware that
It is neither an artistic nor up-to-date
lamp, but it has the merit of being
highly practical, which cannot be said
of the lamps with fancy colored globes
and shades, which mask the light so
completely that close observation is im
possible. Having settled the question
of light, use some judgment in the se
lection of the material on which to sew.
Do not attemot to work on black or on
very dark colors; red la particularly
trying to the eyes, as is material with
fine stripes or checks. Reserve such
goods for daylight work, and at night
work on white and delicate colors as
much as you can. By right planning
the different colors can be made up un
der the best light and thus save much
needless exhaustion. Changing from
one color to another in sewing at night
will sometimes prove very restful If the
eyes are becoming tired.
Decide upon a common sense basis as
to quality and quantity, selecting tha
diet with due regard to its value to
the system, avoiding sweets, fats and
starchy foods. By beginning at the
root of the evil the danger of obesity
may be averted. It is suggested that
you join a gymnasium class and prac
tice faithfully under a competent
teacher, or get a punching bag and
pulley exerciser, using them two hours
daily. For outdoor exercise walk two
miles daily or play golf or tennis, if
preferred.

anybody who is used to Paris frocks
could be satisfied with home-made
cotton shirt waists, it never occurs to
him to look at her chin for the an

probably would get lost in the laces

the lips above it. or would stray away

At present the tract is under the
charge Â¦. and superintendency of Dr.
Gardner, .who has been selected by the
Red Cross for that station. There are
a village, schoolhouse, postofflce and

silver and gold background.
Dr. and Mrs. Gardner have earned a
reputation in Red Cross work, both
being officers in the American society.

one foot high and one foot broad.'
The balance chamber was in the
first days of the torpedo often called
the "secret" chamber because Mr.
Whitehead only allowed the secrets of
its mechanism to be explained to those
who signed a paper promising not to
divulge what they learned. The
secret is now so well known that it
is no breach of confidence to ex
plain that the mechanism consists of
a. combination of hydrostatic valve
and pendulum which controls horizon
tal rudders in the tail of the torpedo.
The hydrostatic valve is supported by
springs against the pressure of water
due to the depth at which the torpedo,
is traveling, so that the depth can'
be regulated by increasing or dimin
ishing the compression of the springs.
With a fast-running torpedo the
pressure on the rudders themselves is
so considerable as to render it neces
sary to use an engine to work them.
The balance chamber combination of
hydrostatic valve and pendulum, there
fore, operates a small valve in a servo
motor engine, the piston of which
moves In obedience to the valve, and
in its turn moves the horizontal rud
ders. The servo-motor is worked by
compressed air, and is' to the torpedo
what steam steering gear s is. to a
steamer. The engines are triple-cyl
inder, single-acting, they. run,at about
1200 revolutions a minute : and develop
about 45 horsepower. ' - *
The Whitehead torpedo could be ad
justed to run a fairly straight course
from a fixed launching apparatus; but
it was not very reliable under the con
ditions which must prevail in warfare,
when it has to be flred from a moving
vessel. Therefore, until recently, it was
generally considered that 400 "yards
would be about the correct range at
which to discharge a torpedo against
an enemy. Under these circumstances
there is but slight wonder that up till
the present war very little execution
has been done with torpedoes. The in
vention of the gyroscope, however,
completely altered matters. A gyro
scope for steering torpedoes was sev
eral times proposed, but it was left to
THIS famous Whitehead torpedoes,

Austria, from where they are supplied
to nearly every country in the world.
Great Britain end Russia are the*ex
ceptior.s, although the French, Ger
mans. Danes and Italians make a cer
tain proportion of torpedoes at home,
and even the Japanese, resourceful in
this as in eo many other directions, .
manufacture a few for themselves.
P Though there are many types of tor
>does, yet the standard dimensions
ay be taken at a diameter of IS
inches and a length of 16 feet 5 inches
for ell thips-of-war except torpedo
boats, and these carry torpedoes hav
ing a diameter of 14 inches and a length
of 14 feet 10 inches. The Russian torpe
do has a diameter of 15 inches and is
19 feet long.
* As with nil sships-of-war and wea
pons, improvements are being con
stantly made in the Whltehead torpe
do, and ceaseless experiments combined
with the application of untiring ener
gy and the nicest skill have made the
present-day torpedo the beautiful and
marvelous weapon that it is. The im
provements are in the direction* of
speed and in the torpedo's range of ac
tion. The speed chiefly depends upon
the pressure at which the torpedo can,
in its air vessel, carry the compressed
air which is used for propelling _it
through the water. Until quite recently
this pressure did not exceed 100 atmos
pheres (about 1500 pounds per square
inch); but Messrs. Whitehead have
now produced a new torpedo in which
the pressure is to be no less than about
22Â«0 pounds per square inch.
A torpedo is constructed in the fol
lowing parts:' The head, which incloses
in %var time the charge of gun cotton
or similar high explosive; the air cham
ber, which is about eight feet Ions:: the
balance chamber, for regulating the
depth at which the torpedo travels: the
engine room, the after part of which
now contains the wonderful gyroscope,
which is literally the brain of the tor
pedo; and the tail. Indeed, the torpe
do is by no means unlike a human
body, for in addition to its brain it has
its lungs in the shape of the air cham
ber and its heart in the form of the en-
Kine-room. And very tough lunprs they
are, too, and a very stout heart it is.
for the little engines develop no less
than 43 horsepower.
The charge of explosive in the head
has varied a good deal with different
patterns or makes of torpedoes, but
it has never been less than 125 pounds
or more than 180 pounds. The lesser
charge would probably either disable
or sink a ship, however large; while
the greater charge would, if properly^
exploded, almost certainly cause her'
to Kink at once. -.;
The charge is fired by a percussion
arrangement which is "safe" until the
torpedo has traveled for a certain dis
tance. The violent blow with which
the point of the torpedo would strike
a vessel is enough to fire the primer
and charge by means of a simple rod
or striker impinging on a detonator.
The safety gear to prevent a prema
ture explosion only consists of a screw
nut on the striker, which is fitted with
small blades like a screw propeller,
which screw back the nut as the tor
pedo passes through the water, and
so allow the striker to have play
enough to strike the detonator.
The air chamber is made from a
steel forging; its walls are three
eighths of an inch thick, and after
having been machined as a hollow
cylinder the ends are screwedTin and
soldered to make them air tight The
forgings, for these chambers have to
be most carefully made, and have to
pass elaborate tests.
The capacity of the air chamber
for an eighteen-jnch torpedo is about
ten cubic feet, but for the latest 150
atmosphere torpedo this capacity has
been increased to about eleven cubic
feet. In other words, the process of
"charging an air chamber of ten cubic
feet to 100 , atmospheres' means that
all the air in a* room ten feet long,
ten feet feroad and ten feet high Is
pressed into a vessel ten feet long.
THE MARVELOUS TORPEDO
an Austrian engineer named M. Orby
to invent the mechanism by which the
gyroscope could be made practicable.
So perfect is the "gyro" now that if
a torpedo be launched in a certain di
rection it 'will maintain that direction
to the end of its run. It is this little
instrument which has made long-range
firing with torpedoes practicable. .
The gyroscope is to the torpedo
what the flywheel is to a watch." It
consists of a wheel about Â»f our and a
half inches in diameter, with a heavy
periphei-y. This wheel can be engaged
with mechanism attached to a strong
clock spring. The wheel is in a gim
bal frame, and on the frame is a small
lever which controls a tiny air valve.
The air valve can admit pressure to
one side or the other of a piston in
a cylinder, and by suitable rods and
which 5 action also locks the gyroscope
wheel in a certain plane. When the
torpedo is launched a lever, ia thrown
over,, an act which admits the air from
the air chamber to the main engines,
and at the same time releases the
clock spring mechanism- This sets the
gyroscope spinning at i a .very high
speed, and, having done so, releases it,
so that it is left spinning freely. It
will therefore resist any motion tend
ing to change the plane in which it is
spinning. If the torpedo swerves to
the right or left the little air valve
opens in -the direction necessary to
move over ,the vertical rudder to cor
rect the deflection. "" It i3 only when
the torpedo has assumed' the 'direc
tion In* which it lay immediately be
fore launching that the vertical rud
ders come "amidships."
The- "gyro" is a delicate instrument
and has to be not only carefully kept
levers the action of the piston Is com
municated to a pair of vertical rud
ders. Before launching the torpedo
the clock spring is, wound up by hand,
but frequently treated for adjustment.
It Is therefore made so that it can be
readily removed from the torpedo. It
is generally kept in ! a little box and
most ingenious appliances ' are pro
vided for adjusting it. When in the
torpedo the "gyro" finds its place in
the after body. Â¦ < i
So- muchr for the torpedo and its
mechanism. Ufet us now look at the
means 'for launching- it.
â¢ All modern ships of considerable size
are fitted with submerged torpedo
tubesâ in other words, launching appa
ratus below the water line. The two
best known systems are those of the
British "Admiralty pattern and the
Armstrong pattern. > Both systems are
kept as, secret, as possible,- but it may
be said that the principal difference Is
that in the Admiralty tube the bar or
shield is run out before firing the tor
pedo and run-in after firing, while in
the Armstrong tube the torpedo and
shield go â¢ out together and the shield
returns automatically as soon as the
torpedo, has gone.
In the Admiralty tube the torpedo Is
ejected by compressed airâ that is, the
tube may be looked upon as a gun and
the torpedo as the shot. A charge of
compressed air is introduced and shoots
out the torpedo. In the Armstrong tube
either cordite or compressed air can be
used.
All the Japanese ships above 9000
tons are fitted with the Armstrong sub
merged torpedo tubes, and the Rus
sians also employ this tube.
Small vessels, such as torpedo-boat
destroyers and torpedo-boats, are much
too small to carry submerged torpedo
tubes, so they are provided with
"above-water" tubes. These are very
simple apparatus, consisting of a
smooth tube into which the torpedo is
placed and from which it is ejected
again by means of either cqmpressed
air or cordite, usually the latter. The
torpedo i3 shot out into the air and
falls into the water, where it quickly
picks up its depth under the influence
of the balance mechanism and horizon
tal rudders, and its direction from the
gyroscope and vertical rudders.
None of the torpedoes now being used!
in the Far East are of the 150 atmos
phere pattern, but they are all fitted
with gyroscopes and are capable of
ranging 2000 yards.
most serviceable and right swagger in

fails to make all connections.
Other than this, it is delightfully
light and airy for every day wear and
you will soon discover after walking
miles in a day that the costume whose
weight is nil is the one that will be
your prime favorite. Again, for even

a great convenience and even if it is

Fast transportation, fine living and
an abundance of pretty frocks cost
moat woefully, and after all is said and
done, Is one any the betterâoff for it?
You can't see any more and as a rule
you are not any happier, and it is a
piece of absolute folly unless you count
your dollars as the majority of people
count their pennies. The traveling bee
has so infested the country that it has
but a case of gad from one place to
another, glancing here and glancing
there and seeing just as little as pos
sible.
But If you really want to see the
fair and are not too proud to take mod
est accommodations you can do it
cheaply and well. Don't try to live at
a hotel and be on hand for all your
meals, for nine times out of ten you
will find yourself blocks away and as
hungry as a bear at meal tlme3. Get
an official list of private houses and
doubtless you will bo much more
comfortable, for at least you will be
out of the bustle and flurry and can
rest and sleep in peace.
Breakfast, to the majority of Ameri
cans, is not what it used to be, so if
you do not feel equal to the task of
running out to coffee, buy an alcohol
lamp and invest in a bottle of alcohol
and you can have tea or coffee and
rolls without the least trouble, to say
nothing of saving twenty-five cents or
more. You may consider saving such
a small piece of < money not worth the

But one thing more and your outfit
will be complete. A skirt and jacket
they are coaxed a trifle. Any soft waist
of mull or silk will complete your out
fit, and you can wear it any place and
at any time-
Pongee suits are another boon to the
woman who travels in a suit case, for
they, too, are soft and some of them
â¢are very stylish and chic, not to men
tion delightfully cool.
And this is the way you can pack
your baby trunk. For instance, say
that your nobby traveling suit Is gray,
or even tan. Get a red hat and a red
silk petticoat and you have one costume
complete and one that you need not be
ashamed of in the bargain. And that
you wear, mind you.
Your pongee shirt waist suit should
be trimmed with red. a red border
about the skirt, red pipings on the
waist and a soft red collar and tie that
is buttoned down under fetching straps.
The touch of color adds wonderfully to
the dull tan, especially when the short
full skirt swings lightly about and gives
one tantalizing glimpses of red ruffles,
trim ankles and neat boots.
The other gown may be one of two â
the black taffeta or a soft black net
ting. And this is the scheme that one
enterprising girl carried out. She made
:i separate demi-train flounce and fin
ished it with three small ruffles so that
it had a pretty fluffy look. But the top
was where she displayed her ingenuity.
The band fastened on the petticoat just
above the knees with safety hooks and
eyes and she possessed both a long silk
lining and a gay petticoat.
The waist, made with elbow sleeves,
was, of course, lined with the same
taffeta, so that in a twinkling of an eye
she could do a bit of hooking and be
onayed like Solomon in all his glory.
If you Miss-Lady-that-traveis-alone

convert your plain hat into quite an
elegant affair. Other than this, such

Gloves are always a necessity, but It

So far so good. If you are going to
stay three weeks or a month, or even
$ few days for that matter, you must
commence your paring down in dainty,
frilly lingerie. All the ruffles take up
needed space and if you have ever tried
to have them laundried in a city that
Â¦was full tu overflowing, you know
something of the heavy expense and
the decided annoyance that is always
such a part of it.
Instead, put your pride in your
pocket and ally forth and buy three
or four combination suits Xjf thin cot

are inexpensive, occupy but little space
and cost but ten cents ttr wash. That
in itself is an important item. Three
or four pairs of cotton stockings will
be sufficient, for you can wash out a
pair every morning and keep them
fresh and clear. I^isle thread open
worked hose are fetching, but they are
a perfect abomination when much
walking has lo be d</nc and the per
sonal comfort that is sacrificed is not
worth the prico of vanity paid.
Night robes ar.d corset covers are
another important item, for they must
be beautifully simple. Two RovÂ»ns,
Â¦with a hemstitched band about the
tleevps and neck through which a rib r
bon is drawn, are not only pretty but

Shoes always seem to be a difficult
problem to solve. There is no denying
the fact that it is a decided rest to takÂ°
them off when they are hot and dusty
and slip into a cool slipper, and this
can be managed if you are willing to
adopt the soft Turkish shoe, that is so
much of a fad with the girl who makes
& specialty for her boudoir negligees.
The shoes that are the best for comfort
and for wear are the four-button rus
set ones; but they do not look smart
with all costumes and are barred for
this reason. A patent or enameled kid
low shoe with a heavy sole and a low,
flat heel is fit, and looks better for gen
cial wear than anything else on the
market. â¢

Cotton shirt waists are entirely too
much of a luxury, besides they wrinkle
s<j easily that they are scarcely ever fit
to be worn before they have made the
acquaintance of the hotel flatiron,
which means parting with both silver
and time.
But as there areNscores of soft, shim
mery silks you need not feel so badly
about the loss of the cotton. Crepes are
especially good. foÂ£ they may be worn,
given a vigorous shake or two and, lo

are not only neat and trim-appearing,
but are a great saving to the waist, for
no matter how particular you may be,
you cannot hope to keep a silk collar
fresh-looking for long, and there is no
one thins that gives such an untidy
appearance as soiled collars or linen. *s
Soft ribbons certainly are comfort
able on warm days, but they are en
tirely too expensive if your pocketbook
is not well Tilled. To be sure, top collars
are a great saving, but as one is not
complete without the other^ these days
it is better policy to invest in- plain
lawn ties. They are hemstitched? and
lÂ«<>k dainty and sweet when fresh, and
as it costs but 3 cents to send them to
the laundry there can scarcely be an
excuse for having them in other than
the nink of condition. Silk ties to match
your waists are good, but the best of
silk never stands the ravages of the
tub half as well as linen; so you may
pay your money and take your choice.

of a moonlight night. The hotel clerk,
when he was approached on this sub

that he didn't think he had ever met
the lady. When he was informed that
she hadn't been particularly active for
a number of years and that her long

could understand and wouldn't like if
he could, he decided that he had better

Once upon a time there occurred an
illness to a certain good and great
man. I read in my daily paper that
the whole nation was plunged in grief.

on being told the news by the waiter,
dropped their heads upon the table
and sobbed. Strangers, meeting In

while, ;from his point of view, keeping
the show open. An old nurse whom I
once took into my confidence was sure,
if I "continued talking in this sort of
way," that he would get me anyhow.: I
must' have been an evil-hearted young

welcome me, the only human being he
had seen for years, had a certain fas

I was abroad at the time, but on the
point of returning home. I almost
felt ashamed to go. I looked at my
self In- the class and was shocked at
my own appearance; It was that of
a man T.'ho had not been in trouble
for weeks. I felt that to burst upon
this grief-stricken nation with a coun
tenance snch as mina would be to
add to their sorrow. It was borne in
upon me that I must be a shallow,
egotistical nature. I had had luck
with a play In America and for the
life of me could not look grief
stricken. There were moments when.
If I was not keeping a watch upon
myself. I found myself whistling.
â¢Had It been possible! would have re
mained abroad fill some stroke of Ill
fortune'had rendered me rr.nre in tune
with my fellow countrymen. But busi
ness was pressing. The first man. I
talked to on Dover Pier was a cus
tom-house official. Tou misht have
thought sorrow would have made him
Indifferent to a mere matter of forty
eight cigars. Instead of which he ap
peared quite pleased when- he found
them. He demanded three and four
pence and chuckled whÂ°n he got it.
On Dover platform a little g^rl laughed
because a lady dropped a hsndbox on
a dog, but then children are always
callous â or, perhaps, she had not
heard the news. What astonished me
most, however, was to find In the rail
way carriage a respectable looking
man reading a comic Journal. True, he
did not laugh much; he had got decen
cy enough for that, but what was a
grief stricken citizen dolncr with a
comic Journal anyhow? _efore I had
been In London an hour I had mm? to
the conclusion that we English must
be a people of wonderful self-control.
The day before, according to the news
papers, the whole country was in se
rious danger of pining away and dying
of a broken heart. In one day the na
tion had pulled itself together. "We
have cried all day," they had said to
themselves, "we have cried all night.
It does not seem to have done much
good. Now let us once again take up
the' burden of life." Some of them â Â¦
I noticed It In the hotel dining-room
that evening â were taking quite kindly
to their food again. Our amusements
are all founded on make-believe. "We

a field, our hands upon our knees. Our
object la to prevent another man from
running up and down between two
rows of sticks. If we catch the ball
he has hit toward us with a bit of
wood, he has to pretend that he cannot
run any more, but must go home
and take hl3 clothes off. We make
believe we want to catch a fox.
As a matter of fact we have not the
slightest use for the fox. We make
believe about quite serious things. In
war, each country's soldiers are always
the most courageous in the world. The
other country's soldiers are always
treacherous and tricky; that la why
they sometimes win. Our governments
are supposed to be founded on the prin

who Is the most beautiful young lady
that ever lived. And in Notting Hill,
we will pretend, there resided a young
man named Edwin, who is In love with
Angelina." And then, there being- suffi

starts away, and pretsnds that Ange

that Edwin did all sorts of wonderful
things. We know he is making it ail

please us. He, on the other hand, has
to make believe that he is doing it be

Mrs. Jolinson. pretending ,to be a

the beginning, my friend is a mad sort
of person.
(Copyrighted. 1904, by the Central
News and Press Exchange.)
*^T MAD friend of mine will have
f I It that the characteristic of the
1 ape is Make Believe. He argues
JL that all social Intercourse Is
Younded on make believe. A servant,
enters to say that Mr. and Mrs. Bore
are in the drawing-room. "Oh.
damn!" says the man. "Hush!" says
the woman. "Shut the door, Susan.
How often am I to tell you never to
leave the door open?" The man creeps
upstairs on tiptoe and shuts himself
up in his study. The woman does
things before a looking glass, waits
till, by force of will, she feels she la
sufficiently mistress 'of herself not to,
thow her feelings, and then enters the*
drawir.jj-room with outstretched
hands, and the look of one welcoming
an angel's visit. She says how de
lighted she is to se.e the Bores; how
pood it was of them to come. Why
did they not bring more Bores with
them? Where Is naughty Bore Junior?
Why does he never come to see her
now; she will have to be really angry
with him. And sweet little Flossie
Bore? Too young to pay calls! Non- :
sense! An "at home" day is not worth,
having where all the Bores are not.
The Bore*, who had hoped that 6he
was out. who have only called because
the etiquette book told them that they
must call at least four times in the
season, explain how they have been
trying: and trying to ceme. "This after- -
noon." recounts Mrs. Bore, "we were
determined to come. "John, dear,* I
said this morning, 'I shall go and sea
deer Mrs. Bounder this afternoon, no
matter what happens." " The idea con
veyed is that the Prince of Wales, on
calling at the Bores, has been told that
he cannot come in. He can call again.
(a the evening or he can come some
"ther day. This afternoon the Bores
aie going to enjoy themselves in their
own way; they are going to see Mrs.
Bounder. '"And how is Mr. Bu-ur.der?"
demands Mrs. Bore. Mrs. Uounder re
mains rnute fur a moment, straining
her ears. She can hear him creeping
past the door on his way downstairs,
hears the front door softly opened
and closed-to. She wakes, as from a
dream. She has been thinking of the
sorrow that will fall on Bounder when
he returns h'ixe later and learns what
he has missed.
And thus it is, not only with tho
Bores and Bounders, but even with us
who are not Bores or Bounders. So
ciety in all ranks is founded on the
make-believe that everybody is charm
ing; that we are delighted to see
everybody; that everybody is delight
ed to see \is; that it is so good of
everybody to come, that we are deso
late at the thought that they really
must go now. Which would we rather
do: stop and finish our cigar, or hasten
into the drawing-room to hear Miss
Sereecher sing? Can you ask us? We
tumble over each other in our hurry.
Miss Screeeher would rather not sing.
But if we insist â we do insist. Miss
Sereecher, with pretty reluctance con
sents. We are careful not to look at
one another. We sit with our eyes
fixfd on the ceiling. Miss Sereecher
finishes and arises. "But. it was so
ehr>rt." we say. so soon as we can be
heard above the applause. Is Miss
Sereecher quite sure that was the
whole of It? Or has she been playing
tricks upon us. the naughty lady, de
frauding us of a verse? Miss Sereecher
assures us that the fault is the com
poser's. But she knows another. At
this hint, our faces lighten again with
pr'adress: we clamor for more. Our
host's wine is always the most extra
ordinary we have ever tasted. No. not

THESE are the successful prizÂ«
â¢winners in the, golf term puzzle
contest of July 10, and every
boy and girl whose name ap-^
pears in this column has a right to be
more than proud, for this is the first
time In many weeks that that full one
hundred and fifty correct answers were
not received. Perhaps those terms were
a trifle tew haid, as golf is not, after
all, common enough to make its terms
familiar, so that those of you who
failed should look at it that way and
trust to the puzzle editor to stay by
Things hereafter which do net em
brace a lot of foreign words which the
most of us never see and probably
wouldn't know if v.e did. Many of
those sending in correct answers stated
that they had to fall back upon the
resources cf big brothers and cousins
and such who knew what golf was
from having played it, so after all
there is plenty of chance for the "new
lot of books on these later puzzles for
those who grew a bit. discouraged over
the gclf terms. These are the names:

have been distinguishing themselves
recently as dramatic authors and ac

Princess cArnulf of Bavaria wrote a
play entitled -Funny Men," which has
been acted before the Bavarian court
with great success, the Princess taking
one of the leading parts.
The Crown Princess of noumanla is

semblage of the dead that mingles in
this part of the abbey. In it are found
divines/ philosophers, essayists, drama

architects, philanthropists, etc., most of
them long forgotten. And among those
who. have left an enduring, mark on
English literature incongruity still
characterizes their commemoration.

composed by Pope, next to Shakespeare

It is the "Poets' Corner" that visit
ors, and especially American visitors,
approach with the greatest reverence
and there they linger longest. But no
other part of the abbey, affords a more
striking: illustration of its \ incongru
ities â of the lack*of any principle of se
lection by which the most deserving of
remembrance were admitted and those
who had no claim to enduring fame
were kept out.
*- APDISON'S COMPLAINT.
Addisnn long ago complained that
here were ."poets who had no monu
ments and monuments which had no
poets." Those whose works are gener
ally forgotten are better represented in
the "Poets' Corner" than those whose
writings are still cherished. No me
morials exist there of Byron, Keats,
Shelley, Moore, Walter Savage Landor,
Sir Philip Sidney, Marlowe, Lovelace,
Herrick, Allan Ramsay, Chatterton,
Massinger and several others deserv
edly far better known than many of
those on whom monuments and fulsome
epitaphs have been bestowed.

King, and a great King, as things were

could be taken to her interment there

nothing more extraordinary than make
a hasty exit from this troubled world
on the same day that he entered it,

tened. But of most of the abbey chil
dren it may be said that no man knows
why they should have been buried
there. That Jjttle Nicholas Bagenall,
for instance, was *"by hys nyrs unfor
tunately overlay'd" when only two
months old, was doubtless a source of
sore grief to his parents something
more than 300 years ago, but there is
no reason why the child's deplorable
fate should continue to be commemo
rated by an ungainly black pyramid
and urn when space is needed to make
room for those who have done noble
work for England.
SMITH FAMILY REPRESENTED.
The Smith family is the most numer
ous in the country, but if merit were to
determine who among them is most
worthy of burial in the abbey the
choice would certainly not fall on one
Thomas Smith of whom nothing is*
known save the inscription on his tab
let that "through the* spotted veil of
the smallpox he rendered a pure and
unspotted soul to God." In the south
aisle of the great nave is a monument
to another Smithâ John Smithâ who
died In 1718. He may have been a very
worthy manâ nobody, knows-^-but if his
family had not some pull with the dean
he never would have been thus reached
from oblivion. It would seem
though in those good old days influence
could get almost anybody buried in the
abbey. The Duke of Buckingham had
a Scotchman buried there for no other
reason than that he was his friend. On
the same day a lot of people ' got to-

AX IMMORTAL BLACKGUARD.
So far wore' than Craggs was
Thomas T . nn, a blackguard whosa
memorial stands near *^at of the saint
ly Wesleys, the founders of Methodism,
that a dean refused to be responsible
for the striking discrepancy between
historic fact and ;:oetic fiction dis
mayed In his eoita^h and ordered it
erased, while allowing his monument
to remain. Thynn vas a favorite of
Charles II. He was a rich man. but
to add to liTi wealth compelled the
child widow of Lord Ogle, heiress* to
the vast Northumberland estates of
the Percies, to marry him. She was
only 15. and fled to Holland to escape
him, whereupon he instituted law pro
ceedings to get possession of her prop
erty.
One of her suitors* Count John
Konigsmark, a Swedish nobleman,
sent him a challenge by Captain Vratz.
one of his followers. Thynn responded
by dispatching six men to France to
murder the pair of them. Their mis
sion failed. Then the Count tried th*
game of murder with more success. As
Thynn was riding down Pall Mall one
Sunday evening his coach was stopped
by Captain Vratz and two hired vil
lians and Thynn's career was ter
minated by a blunderbuss. . A bas
relief on the monument depicts the
murder, and . incidentally Justifies the
boast subsequently made by Thynn's
coachman that he, too, had his effigy
in the abbey.
XO PAINTER IN THE ABBEY.
It is a singular fact that no painter
is interred in the abbey, for no other
reason apparently than that successive
deans had no appreciation of that form
of art. And it is one of the many
strange illustrations of the irony of
fate found tn the abbey that the only
painter who' has a monumer there is
the same Sir Godfrey Kneller who so
emphatically expressed his aversion to
being entombed within its walls be
cause "they do bury fools there." Sir
Godfrey himself designed the monu
ment, for which he left $1500, and chose
a place for it in Twickenham Church,
but the spot selected was already occu
pied by Pope's tablet to his father, and
as the poet refused to give way to the
painter, the painter's monument was
LONDON, July M.â "I will not ba
burled In Westminster,** said Sir God
frey Kneller, aa he lay dying, to bis
friend Pope, "they do bury fools there."
It was In 1723 that Sir Godfrey deliver
ed fcimaelf of trite contemptuous opin
ion of those Interred in England's fa
mous Waihalla, but it is worth recall
ing now for the reason it Is largely be
cause the abbey contains so many
bodies and monuments of those whose
only claim to distinction is the fact
that their dust lies thereâ a goodly
number of them buried Bince Sir God
frey passed away â that entombment
within its walls has been denied to
Stanley, whose right to be numbered
among England's great and heroic
dead cannot be disputed. Not but
what the pious dean with whom rested
the final decision could still have made
room for the renowned explorer had he
been eo xrinded.
Had Stanley penetrated darkest Af
rica with a Bible and a bevy of mis
sionaries, instead of with a rifle and
armed followers, undoubtedly his mor
tal remains would have been welcomed
tc the abbey, for many lie there whose
only claim to remembrance was their
eminently orthodox piety. As recently
Â£5 1SS9 Minor Canon Troutbeck, a
member cf the ecclesiastical staff of
the abbey and chaplain in ordinaryjto
Queen Victoria, was buried in one'of
the cloisters. Think of it! Stanley ex
cluded with the intimation that he was
not Quite great enough to be deserving
of such an honor and a minor canon
admitted as abundantly worthy of it.
PATRIOTIC PRIDE.
Xo other place appeals so strongly to
Anglo-Saxon patriotic pride as West
minster Abbey. It is regarded as the
sacred shrine of those who have done
most to make England great. All who
enter come under the spell of its magic
charm. Within its hallowed walls crit
icism seems as sacrilegious as would be
strictures passed on such wondrous
works of nature as Niagara Falls or
the Grand Canyon of Arizona. "It
seems," wrote Washington Irving, "as
if the awful nature of the place
rresses down upon the soul and hushes
the btholder into noiseless reverence.
We feel that we are surrounded by the
< or.gregated bones of the great men of
past times who have filled history with
Their deeds and earth with their re
nown."
That is the way everybody feels â
or feels that he ought to> feel â about
Westminster Abbey and the trans
atlantic visitor modestly attributes his
unfamiliarity with most of the names
he sees inscribed on tombstones, mon
uments and tablets to his own ignor
ance of things he ought to know in
English history. But as a matter of
fact among these "congregated bones"
those that carried really great men
through this world are far outnumber
ed by the osseous relics of those who
achieved merely temporary fame,
mediocrities and nobodies. "The ab
bey," writes Rev. William J. Loftfe.
one cf the few historians of it who
dares to tell the truth about it, "is
full of memorials of second and third
rate celebrities."
ONCE OPEN* TO ALL SORTS.
The mortuary chambers of the abbey,
row co Jealously guarded that even
Stanley is refused burial there, were
In the past thrown open wide to all
sorts of strange and dubious folk. In
this supposed shrine of the immortals
meet the good and the bad, the great
and the petty, the noble and the ig
noble, the famous and the infamous,
rr.uch as they do in any ordinary grave
yard. A motley gathering it would
make If the ghosts of those commemo
rated in the abbey should assemble
some night to take stock of one an
other. Unless sojourn in the other
world begets much greater charity than
is usually founti In this, there would be
much Fnifflng and tilting of dis
tinguished phantom noses and dis
trusted exclaimations of "How the
deuce came you here?" Wilberforce
might find himself hustled aside by a
pugilist; Pitt might be moved to de
nounce a swindling Secretary of
State; Wolfe might be confronted by a
Fpy; Tennyson might find himself In
the company of a writer of scurrilous
verses, and on the outskirts of the
crowd there might be found hovering
divines, minor poets, pages of the
backstairs, a plumber, a butler, a
starcher and all sorts of long forgotten
obscure people.
AMONG THE IMMORTALS.
That a prizefighter is buried in West
minster Abbey is widely known, be
cause It happens to be mentioned in
the official deanery guide, which every
visitor buys, and many are the ejacu
lations of pious horror that have been
uttered over such scandalous desecra
tion of this most famous of all sanc
tuaries of the dead. But John Brough
ton is really much more worthy of such
honor than many who are interred
there. He was a notable man in his
way. He fought his way to the top of
his profession and by pluck and hard
hitting maintained himself there for
several years. He lived to a green old
age and was long employed as a verger
in the abbey before he died in 1783. He
wished to have the words "Champion
Prizefighter of England," which con
stituted his claim to fame, inscribed
on his tombstone. But the dean of the
abbey would not permit It, and on the
tablet to his memory in the West
Cloister Broughton is commended to
the remembrance of posterity merely
as a "Yeoman of the Guard." When
priate than a tablet, above Chaucer's
tomb, to John Roberts, "the very faith
ful secretary of the Honorable William
Pelham," a Minister who held office
under George II? And when such men
as Byron, Keats and Shelley still re
main unrecognized In the abbey why
should room any longer be given to
Thomas Chaffinch and John Osbaldls
ton, "Pages \ of the Bedchamber" to
Charles II? *
SOME ROGUES REST THERE.
If only the great and herolo wera
commemorated in this place that with
more of poetry than truth has been
called "the silent meeting place of tha
great dead of eight centuries," there
would be room for the memorials of all
whose names are inscribed high on tha
rolls of England's fame. In the bap
tistry is a monument to James Craggs,
who was Secretary of State when he
died in 1720. only 32 years old. Pope
composed the epitaph which commem
orates his virtues.
Statesman yet friend to truth! of soul sincere.
In action faithful, and In honor clear!
Who broke no promi*?. served no private end.
Who rained no title and who lost no friend;
Ennobled by himself, by all approved.
Praised, wept and honored by the muse na
loved.
Yet when the South Sea bubble burst
and its books were overhauled this
same Craggs "in honor clear" was dis
covered to be an arrant rogue, his
name appearing In the subscription
lists for the fictitious sum of $1,650,000,
the price of his "influence." Pope had
no desire to be buried in the abbey
) j.
Because he chanced to be employed
as a butler in Westminster School
Thomas Warren was interred ' - one of
the cloisters in 1699. By marrying a
"Page of the Back Stairs," and as "Mis
tress Starcher," superintending Queen
Anne's washing, Elizabeth Abrahal
gained a similar posthumous honor.
For looking after Queen Anne's hens
and chickens David Davis, "First
Groom of Her Majesty's Poultry
Office," was buried, in this ground
consecrated to the great, with several
members of his family, including a six
year-old son. Nor did the little fellow
lack company there. , Many children
are burled in the abbey and none of
them was a prodigy.
The first child to be buried there, the
the time comes, as it must, when they
will have to begin removing bones from
the abbey to make room for those who
are really deserving of interment
there, honest John Broughton's should
not.be the first to be disturbed.
Prizefighters are often popular idols,
butit would be difficult to conceive of
any occupation more remote from the
paths' that lead to glory than that o! a
plumber. Yet in the holy quiet of one
of the cloisters of this temple of fame
a plumber is buried â one Philip Clarke
â for no other reason than that he
fixed the pipes and soldered up leaks
for Westminster School, an appendage
of the abbey. But no memorial will be
found in the abbey of that solder arti
ficer whom the world can. never forget,
the immortal tinker, John Bunyan.
MINGLE WITH THE GREAT.
"When a great man dies," wrote Sir
Walter Besant. "the Dean should re
move the monument of one of the un
known to make room for the newcom
er; in that way the abbey would be
come more and more the holy field of
the British empire." This policy will
have to be adopted soon. The Abbey
has witnessed the exhumation of tho
bodies of great men. After the Restora
tion the corpses of Cromwell, Ireton
and other notable leaders of the com
monwealth were taken from their
graves and subjected to many indigni
ties. Illegitimate descendants of
Charles II fill some of the places thus
made vacant. Some day perhaps these
latter may in turn be disinterred to
make room for men of unsullied fama.
Apart from actresses, great women
have received the most scant recogni
tion in the abbey, though memorials
have been bestowed on many of the
sex there. Aphra Behn, the barber's
daughter, perhaps has some claim to
fame as the first woman to earn a liv
ing by her pen in England, though her
licentiousness was notorious, and
Charles II made use of her as a spy
during the Dutch war. By - ay of con
trast it is interesting to note that ac
cording to the inscription on Mrs. Mar
tha Birch's monument she was
"chaste, wise and prudent,' though it
is evident she owes her place among
the immortals not to those commenda
ble virtues, but to the fact that her
second husband was a prebendary of
the abbey.
On the tablet to Mrs. Katherine
Bovey, on the south itZe of the great
nave, it is recorded t> - ; her "person
and understanding would havt become
the highest rank in life, and her vivac
ity would have recommended her in th~
best conversation, but by judgment, as
well as by inclination, she chose such
retirement as gave her great oppor
tunity for reading and reflection."
Apparently, therefore, she is commem
orated in thi3 temple of fame because
of what she might have been had she
not chosen to be something else. But
the incongruities of the abbey are end
less.
got rid of by placing it In tha abbsy
with an epitaph which Pope acknowl
edged to be the worst he had ever
written.
Of ecclesiastical dignitaries and di
vines there are about four dozen com
memorated in the abbey and no par
ticular standard of greatness seems to
have been applied In determining their
fitness for such an exalted honor. ThÂ«
great majority of them have been con
nected with thÂ» abbey. 'Among them
is Dean Sprat, now chiefly remembered
because he refused to allow Milton's
name to appear In an epitaph to some
body else in the abbey. But Deans of
"Westminster, whether great or little,
are buried in the abbey as a matter of
course. Dean Stanley and bis wife ara
burled In Henry VII's Chapel, whera
the Dean has an Imposing monument
and his wife a memorial window. Dean
Stanley was a saintly and lovable man.
a great man, too. many might consider
him, but yet he did no such work to
win lasting remembrance as that other
rejected Stanley, without whose nama
the history of Africa % can never bÂ«
written.

expert hypnotist, that he dabbled in
palmistry, and discoursed of the value

Nina David, a new coloratura so
prano that Robert Grau will exploit
during the coming season, is said to
have the "greatest range in the world."
She runs six notes taller than Patti's
highest in 18S1. Mystery and moonshine
are, however, being largely used in Misa
David's advertisement. Mr. Grau sends
out among others the following state
ments about her:
"While there seems to be an air of
mystery over the personality and iden
tity of the coloratura singer. Nina
David, Robert Grau wishes it to ba
clearly understood that she is an un
known artiste and an absolute discov
ery of his; but while the career of Nina
David has not embraced tours of ereat
countries at thousands a night, it is not
because musical managers have nut
heard of her, for Grau claims that ha
Â¦was In competition with all of them
for nearly a year past, and it was only
because he outbid them, as he did in
the case of Patti. that- he succeeded.
Ninety-five per cent of the musical
profession know of Nina David, and
there is not a local manager in all of
this country who is not discounting tha
musical furor she will mak^ by book
ing her company on terms that would
be prohibitive if she were not sure to
be a big box office proposition. Nina
David Is, according to Grau. the world's
greatest coloratura singer. She has the
greatest vocal range in the world. Sha
has never sung in New York beforo
audiences, but nearly all the musicians
have heard her, and she is under con
tract not to sing a note until she faeca
her first audience at' Carnegie' Hall in
New York, and it will then be decided
if the manager has been wise. Grau
has repeatedly sntd he would not take
$100,000 for his contract with the new
diva, and he has shown his confidence
in her by surrounding her with artists
of world wide fame, and given her an
entourage worthy of the successor of
the Patti of a decade ago. Madame
David is a relation of Felicien Devid.
who has written more of the difficult,
florid and bravoura music than any
composer of recent years, and it is tha
masterpiece number of this comooser.

she will first endeavor to convince her
listeners that her right to the title of

It is to be confessed that Orpheum
<Â»ceultism had long ago ceased to in
terest me. The ladies that get into
large baskets to be stabbed by Mr.
Herrmann I knewâ well. I knew how
they got out. The delightful spectacle
- t money-coining In the Herrman and
Â«ther hats, that, too â alas!â I knew an
illusion. The floating lady fascinated,
until I discovered that the Herrmann
wand was not her only means of sup
port. The "Svengalis" hypnotics
amused, but I could not accept them
as four eouls with but a single thought
In fact. I was fast developing a nasty
>kepticism concerning O'Farrell street
magic
It was, therefore, without any par
ticular thrill that I heard of the com
ing of the "mysterio-ufl Zancigs." tele
pathists in ordinary to this and that
Rajah in India, psychics extraordinary
in general. I hoped only that the fâ e
would be better fun than usual. It
was. It was. in fact, not a fake. Al
most persuaded before of telepathic
possibilities, the Zancig performance
leaves me utterly, abjectly convinced.
Now I am only wondering whether to
exercise my concentrative faculties on
the god of raised salaries or of long
\ acations â for Meinherr Zancig dis
claims any monopoly of miracle. "Any
one can do it," this weird person af
firms, as he pinions a man at one end
of the Orpheum and Madame at the
other remarks that the victim is
blonde, slightly scarred behind the left
car and named Heautontimorenous
Jones!
My introduction to this weird pair
was unusually fortunate. They were,
in fact, heralded by the most redoubt
able skeptic of my acquaintance. They
had obligingly held him up on the high
seas and convinced him of sin on their
way here from the Orient. I was grate
f Jl. I had labored humbly thereto my
self. The K. S. had remained unkindly
deaf to my suggestion that there might
t<e "something in it." My proof was in
adequate. And here he was transform
ed from the most doubting of Thom
ases into an even ardent disciple. It
was. therefore, with rather lively ex
pectations that I went to see the Zan
cigrs, within the close range of a pri
vate chat.
The first glimpse was a little disap
pointing. They don't, as they should,
live in a cave. You take the elevator
to their rooms and when you get there
they are just like every one else's.
There was a broomstick, it is true, but
there was a Chinese "boy" at the end

thins of a nice, creepy feeling. But I
didn't see any toe of newt or eye of

by it a serious-looking gentleman in
conventional morning garb. And by
him there was a little lady, brown
eyed, demure, sweet, sewing buttons
on the serious-looking gentleman's
vest. I thought there must be some
mistake, but my friend insisted: "The

It was all comically conventional at
first. We even looked at photographs.
Yet here the conventional ended. The

comment of the travelers, one seemed
to be rapidly a-journeying to the won

"This man," Paid the professor, sing

monarch, with an intense Intellectual
weariness vstamped upon the face, "is
the Maharajah Kumar. He gaw us at
the Royal Theater in Calcutta and sent
for us to come 'to his castleâ Tapore

like to see it?"
From a pocketbook full of cardsâ the
cards of princes, rajahs, mandarins.
even as thine and mine â the professor
took this prince's, and I looked at it as
he said:
"We were the only European per
. formers over Invited to his castle."
"Fine man," Mrs. Zancig added. "He
knew everything, I think. He had a
wonderful library â one room, four
times as lsrpe as thisâ with nothing in
!t but bonks on occultism. That is why
he was interested in us."
"You gave a performance for him
then?" I asked.
"Yes. indeed." the professor replied,
"and he v.as very pleased. But it was
very uncomfortable. One was treated
like a king. Servants bowing; why, if
you wanted your chair turned 'round
like this " The professor sprang
alertly behind his chair and turned it
Fix inches more to the west. "Why,
you hollered 'boy!' and the servants
turned It."
"But such a dream of a place," sigh
ed Mrs. Zancig; "wonderful marble pil
lars and 6ilken rugs and perfumed
woods and ivoriesâ ah! And all his la
dies behind the lattices, peeping
through. They couldn't come down be
cause my husband was a man."
"And afterward, what you think?"
unllrd the professor. "I had admired
a suit of clothes worn by one of the
Maharajah's men, and after we had
Kone home he sent a servant to us with
four tailors, .who measured both of us
Jor fults."
"They took twenty men a month to
make," Mrs. Zancig added,
"Oh* it'B too beautiful!" I cried. "Did
you know that you had been living in
the. Arabian Nights T'
"You'll think so when you have seen
the suits," the professor laughed, and
'then, heralded by poignant, strange
perfumes, the suits were shuwn to meâ
"Well, I noticed first that Madame
Zancig would so often say the thing
that I was thinking of." recalled the
professor. "Then we experimented, and
did the thing for fun at first, never
thought of making a living at it."
"It is all 'harmony'" explaned Ma
dameâsurely as sweet and kind a little
dazzling velvets, splendidly daring of
color and sewn close with jewel and
spangle in lavish barbaric patterns;
taJPhats with rare aigrettes and bril
liant shoes by , Calcutta, complete
the royal outfit. They tumbled out
ether lovely loot In the search for th*
clothes â glorious shells from the Natal
beach in Africa, ostrich feathers as
picked from the tree, exquisite em
broideries from Japan, a cane "
"Indian?" I questioned.
"There are 540 pieces of wood of dif
ferent kinds in that," the professor in
formed me, handing the cane along.
"That was given to me by the Guru
M ahad c vasram ' '
"I'll take the rest on trust," I said
hurriedly, as he showed me the Guru's
picture, a small, frail child, upon whose
slim shoulders hang the destinies of
many thousands of Hindoos.
"They also entertained us," said ma
dame; "the little boy sat in state and
his mother had to peep through a crack
in the door."
"Did any of them show you any
magic?" I asked then.
Mr. Zancig looked at Mrs. Zancig and
both laughed, a little uncertainly. "Oh,
yes," said the professor, "most of it
very good, but quite explainable. Still,
the Hindoo magicians will do, right on
the open street and wearing only a loin
cloth, tricks that our magicians cannot
do on the stage." ,Â«\.
"But I mean real magicâ the kind
Max Muller tells about," I persisted.
"There was one strange thing"âhes
itated the professor.
"Ah, that's what I want," I encour
aged.
"Well, this I can't account for," the
professor owned. "I had given a per
formance for the Prince Asmon â etc. â
and he asked me afterward if I should
like to see some native magic, promis
ing me I should if I would not be
afraid. Of course I said 1 wasn't afraid
and placed myself in the hands of the
magician. Well, he took me one mile,
two miles, three, four, perhaps five
miles, into the jungle. There we went
into a tiny grass hut that had a rock
covered with a skin as a seat at one
side. He made me a motion to sit
down. I sat down. Then he asked me to
close my eyes â he seemed to go into a
sort of trance. Of course I thj/ught of
hypnotism, and kept saying: 'Am I
all right? I am all right! I am all
right:* There .was utter silence, only
for a little rustle of dry leaves, then
the fakir told me to open my eyes and
not speak. Well" â the professor looked
at me doubtfully, and with an evident,
elaborate honesty in his gray eyes â "I
shouldn't like to exaggerate, but I
should say there were 300, perhaps 500,
snakes in that hut, squirming all over
that man and lifting their nasty, fiat
heads all 'round my feet, but never at
tempting to strike me! I will admit a
peculiar sensation. The fellow didn't
n^ed to tell me not to speak. I couldn't.
Tnen he told me to shut my eye3
again. I got them shut somehow. It
looked like a long while until he told
me to open them. As before, there
wasn't the slightest noise, and not a
'dura 1 â pardon meâ snake when I
opened them."
"Best snake story I ever heard, pro
fessor," I testified heartily.
"A fact, though," he smiled. "Of
course you can't believe it. I don't.
But I saw them! You can say I'm still
guessing," as he saw me make a note
And now won't you do something
for me?" I asked, "no snakes, though!"
"Certainly," Mr. Zancig said, and
went ovrr to a table whereon lay a
couple of common black wooden slates.
"Now, if you will write something on
here," and he handed me one of the
slates, "Madame Zancig will write it oq
her slate in the other room."
The little lady took her slate into an
inner room, and then as I wrote:
"Java, Carrots, N^ishapur, 'The Call
of the Wild,' Mayor Schmitz," etc., etc.,
on my -slate, she scribbled them down
on hers, ten feet aWay from me. with
her back to mo, without any possibility
on earth that she could have seen what
I wrote, and ali with the cool air of
one making out a laundry list.
Rut the professor. There is where
the effort comes. He sat by me, a long,
nervous finger pressed against his
temple, the pupils of his keen gray
eyes darkening and dilating, his whole
body tense, charged, with concentrative
will. Then, at his command, she "saw"
pictures that we looked at, added up
enormous sums on the slates before
usâ much more quickly than I could
and occasionally more rapidly than
the professorâ read the morning paper
that I held in my hands, "saw" the rose
I wore, informed me there were .twelve
stoner in a pin I had onâ a fact before
unnoted. In fact Madame Zancig
"saw" all that the professor sawâ and
some things that he had not willed her
to see. For instance fn "seeing" a scar
on the brow she "saw" the hair above
it. In reading a headline in the paper
she "saw" the picture below it.
And there is no question of collusion.
A code of signals that would include
the variety of phenomena in the ex
hibition would be infinitely more won
derful than the employment of tele
pathy. Quite frequently not a word
passes between the two. The professor
taps the figure or word with his chalk,
one tap. Madame answers to it as
readily as to the "now" that he usually
employs. Nor can the law of coinci
dence explain the case. Personally, for
I "had before seen genuine examples of
thought transference, the chief
wonders of the Zancig performance are
its speed and certainty. The whole
fourteen volumes of the Psychical Re
search Society's reports (lovely stuff
to read o' dark nights when the wind
howls high) contain no such case.
"How did you happen to come to do
this?" I asked them then.

Now that the Yosemite is proving
such a lodestar" for tourists, most of
whom go in by team, concerted action
is about to be taken to prohibit auto

asserted, and with a good show of
truth, that the sudden appearance of a
machine on a narrow mountain road â
hundreds of feet above the valleys be
low â is not conducive to the safety of
the fellows behind the horses. There
fore the following resolution, .which
may seem rather unjust to the motor
enthusiasts â whose necks, by the way,
are not endangered by scared horse
flesh: "To the Honorable Quardlan of
the Yosemite Valley: By presentation
to the honorable Board of Commission
ers of Yosemite Valley, we, the under

the danger arising from the driving: of
automobiles on the narrow roads of the
valley, where horses are driven along
side of dangerous precipices, and the
alarm at the sight of automobiles con
stitutes a peril to life. We earnestly
ask you to use your influence to forbid
the driving of automobiles in and
around the Yosemite Valley as long as
they constitute a menace to life and
safety."
Should any action restricting the red

be taken many who now fear the stag

LONDON, July 23.â The wedding of

rather quiet. I have seldom seen so
many flowers in this favorite church.
In the chancel and on the altar were
masses of marguerites, lilies of all
kinds and other white flowers. Favors
of lilies of the valley were distributed
to the guests.
The bride, who looked rather nervous
but very charming, wore a dress of a
delicate shade of silver gray moire,
with. fine lace collar and yoke, around
her neck being a broad band of black
velvet and a string of fine pearls. A
gray hat, trimmed with long gray
ostrich feathers, was worn with this,
and she carried a shower bouquet of
orchids.

greater part of its cargo was consigned
to firms in Kobe, but it was felt quite
likely that it would ultimately reach
the Japanese fighting forces. It is
feared the Russians might think them
selves justified in seizing the ship un

CALL BUREAU, HOTEL BARTON. |
WASHINGTON, July 23.â It is believed
here to-night that the United States
Government will declare its position on
the right of search of vessels on the
high seas in time of war and its defini
tion of contraband of war in an official
statement to be Issued on Monday. The
Department of State has this plan'un
der consideration, and it is regarded
favorably by most of thÂ£ prominent
officials of that department. This state
ment, it is said, will follow practically
the. same lines as' that Issued by Pres
ident McKInley in 1898, during the war
with Spain. +
The McKinley proclamation stated
primarily that the United States Recog
nized the proposition that a neutral
flag is supposed to cover neutral car
goes, and yet admitted the right of
search of ships going, to an enemy's
port. If it be not discovered by an ex
amination of the ship's papers that it
is carrying contraband of war, the
search shall go no further, unless there
are .well-grounded suspicions that the
papers are not correct. If contraband
of war be found the vessel may be
seized and her disposition left to a prize
court.
If the statement be issued by this
Government, there will possibly be In
corporated with it the proclamation
issued by Russia when the war with
Japan began, regarding contraband of
war. This proclamation was sent In its
entirety to the State Department by
Embassador McCormlck at the time it
was issued.

The outlook for the Democrats in the
Senate of the Sixtieth Congress, which
will come in on March 4, 1907, is not
much more encouraging. Of the Sen
ators whose terms will expire then six
teen are Republicans and fourteen are
Democrats. Thus, if the Democrats
should make the maximum gains pos
sible in the next Senate, they could
not control that body and could not
hope to gain enough two years hence
to control the Senate In the Sixtietn
Congress, and it can safely be predict
ed that unless there is an unprecedent
ed Democratic landslide this year, the
effects of which will continue over for
two years, the Senate will be safely
Republican for the entire four years
of the next Presidential administra
tion, whether that be Republican or
Democratic
SIMILAR OUTLOOK FOR 1907.
The Fifty-ninth Congress will con
vene on March 4 next. At the present
time there are ninety members of the
Senate. Of these fifty-seven are Repub
licans and thirty-nine- are Democrats,
thus giving the Republicans a majority
of twenty-four.
The terms of thirty United States
Senators will expire on March * 3 next
Of these twenty- three are Republicans
and seven . Democrats^ Should the
Democrats still' hold the seven seats/ it
would be necessary for them to gain
twelve to make the Senate a tie. Eacfi
side would then have forty-five .seats.
Should Democratic successors be
chosen in thirteen of the States where
the terms .of Republicans will expire
next March they ;*ill then have a ma
jority of one.
DEMOCRACY'S CASE JIOPELESS.
But an analysis of the situation
shows that there are not a sufficient
number of close States to warrant the
hope that the Democrats can even
make a tie.
In Ohio Senator Dick was elected "by
the Leg:s a:uie last winter and in Ma y-
Iand Raynor, a Democrat, has been
elected to succeed Senator McComas.
Thus the Democrats have already
gained one seat, but it is difficult to
figure out where they could gain any
more. In many of the States that the
Democrats are hoping to win from the
Republicans there are holdover mem
bers of the State Legislatures with such
Republican majorities as to make it
doubtful if the Democrats could elect
Senators even if they carried the
electorate ticket.
NEW YORK. July 23.â Should the
Democrats win the Presidential race
in the coming national election (a vio
lent assumption), and should they elect
a substantial majority of the House of
Representatives, there Is little or no
probability that they would control the
Senate. The upper branch of Congress
is certain to be Republican for the next
four years, and it will take a political
upheaval such as is not now expected
for. the Democrats to win It within six
or eight years.

NEWPORT, R. I., July 23.â Friends
of Mrs. George Crocker, who returned
from abroad very ill on Monday and
who was brought' here Tuesday morn
ing, were much cast down to-day to
learn that her condition is very critical.
She has not improved since her arrival
here, as was hoped, but, on the other
hand, she has grown worse, and it is
feared that she cannot recover.
With Mrs. Crocker are her husband,
her son, Alexander H. Rutherford, and
her daughters, Mrs. Philip Kearney and
Miss Alice Rutherford, whose marriage
to J. Langdon Irving was expected to
be one of the most interesting society
events of the season.
Dr. William T. Bull is in charge of
the case, and Dr. Walker, Dr. Bull's
assistant, is in constant attendance.
Mrs. Crocker was 111 in. February
when she sailed for Europe and, going
to Cannes; she submitted to an opera
tion at which two eminent surgeons of
London and Paris were present. From
Cannes she was taken to Paris, where
her condition was so serious that it was
not thought she would be able to return
to thi3 country. She- grew stronger,
however, and the trip. was made with
a view to coming as soon as possible to
Newport, where Mrs. Crocker had
leased a villa of Professor Charles W.
Shields, at Ochre Point.
"The callers and 'messengers carrying
flowers for the patient are so numer

Rutherford of San Francisco, was

late Charles Crocker of San Francis

residence at No. 1 East Sixty-fourth
street is one of the most attractive in

early to-day. The citizens and police
had formed a vigilance committee,
rounded up about thirty members of
the undesirable element and run them,
out of town, some of them returning in l
the night. While Officers Harrison and
Stanbrough were making the rounds of
the town they were attacked and shot
by a gang of roughts. The officers |
drew their revolvers and wounded two
of the attacking party, whom they ar
rested. The others escaped.
- To-night a policeman attempted to
make an arrest and the man refused to
stop when commanded by the officer to
do so. The officer fired a shot, which
went wide of its mark and struck E. E.
Moore in the leg.
TROOPS WILL BE SENT.
During the round-up of grafters, law
less characters and other undesirable
persons the police captured a wagon
containing a large quantity of dyna
mite and a complete kit of burglars'
tools. These were confiscated and three,
men were placed under arrest. They,
refused to give their names and are in
jail awaiting a hearing.
About forty of those gathered in dur

women took, chances on drawing the
2412 quarter sections on the Rosebud
Indian reservation in Southern South
Dakota.
Uncle Sam, who frowns upon lotte

chance in 1000 to get a farm worth $2j
an acre and one chance in 100 to get a
farm worth paying the required $4 per
acre to the Government and the In
dians.
The beneficiaries of this unprece
dented rush for land, this outburst of
the national spirit to get something for
nothing, are the railroad companies.
Their passengers have paid them on
an average $10 each, which makes their
gross receipts from this lottery $1,100,
000. The average person going to reg
ister has paid fully V> for lodging and
meals, or $550,000 for those items. The
total registration fees amount to $27,-
C00, or a total outlay for registering
alone of $1,677,500.
The 107,533 who will draw nothing
have therefore expended, besides their
time and effort, more than $1,640,000.
This is more than the entire reserva

The thousands who have made the

tions, after a long conference, sent an
ultimatum to the representatives of the
packers, demanding a settlement of the
strike before Monday morning, on pen
alty of a general walk-out of all union
employes at work in the stockyards at
7 o'clock on Monday morning.
The conference between the repre
sentatives of the allied trades and the
packers and the butchers, which ad
journed last night after failing to
reach an agreement, was resumed
early this morning. At noon the con
ferees gave up hope of reaching an
understanding and the deliberations
were brought to an abrupt ending,
after the packers had expressed a de- i
sin? to live up to the terms of the arbi- â¢
tration agreement m reached last j
Wednesday, right any wrongs that
might have been committed by their
foremen and superintendents and had
announced to the union men the name
of Samuel McLean of the National
Packing Company to represent them
on the arbitration board provided for
in the agreement which settled the :
original strike.
ULTIMATUM TO PACKERS.
The union men refused positively, to
consider that agreement valid, on the
ground that it had been broken by the
packers. They then retired to the of
fice of the Federation of Labor, where
an ultimatum to the packers was pre
pared under the direction of Michael J.
Donnelly, president of the Butchers'
Union: Thomas I. Kidd, of the Ameri
can Federation of Labor, and repre
sentatives of trades that will be asked
to join in the general strike. The ulti
matum is as follows:
"Edward Morris and Associates â Aft
er careful consideration by the repre
sentatives of the teamsters and me
chanical trades we have come to the '
conclusion that the agreement which
was reached on Wednesday- has been
flagrantly violated by the packers to i
the extent of rendering it, in our opin
ion, null and void; hence we cannot \
consistently expect the butcher work
men to renew it in its present form be
cause of such violation.
"We desire to emphasize our belief
in the principles of conciliation and ar
bitration, but to provide against such
violations in the future we again offer
the following propositions as a solution
of the present difficulty:
"That all employes be hired back In
ten days. Any person not re-employed
at the end of that time, his or her case
will be submitted to arbitration.
"That all killing, cutting and casing
department men be reinstated in their
former positions within forty-eight
hours after resumption of work.
"We regret to eay that If the forego
ing propositions are not acceptable to
you the allied trades will cease work
on Monday morning.
"Trusting, however, that you will co
operate with us to bring about an ami
cable understanding and thus avert the
possibility of a widespread strike, we
are. respectfully yours,
"GEORGE F. GOLDEN. Chairman,
"JOSEPH W. MORTON. Secretary,
"Committee of Allied Trades."
STAXD FIRM.
The reply of the combined packers to
the ultimatum of the allied trades was
delivered to-night. The communication,
which Is addressed to Chairman Golden
and Secretary Morton, Is as follows:
"Gentlemen: Your communication of
this afternoon has been received and
carefully noted. We most emphatically
deny that there has been any violation
of the agreement on our part. _ur ex
planation, after investigating every
supposed case, should have satisfied
every one present at the last two < n
ferences that there were no deviations
but what might be expected in putting
to work such a large body of men at
one time, but which could have been
readily adjusted had the organization
desired to so do.
"We regard Mr. Donnelly's action as
entirely unjustified In calling the sec
ond strike on sensational and mislead
ing reports within an average of thirty
minutes from . the time the men were
ordered to work, and before it was pos
sible for any considerable number to be
placed, without making the slightest
effort to verify such reports or to rem
edy such violations, if they existed.
"We have a agreement with
our employes, the same having been
signed by their representatives and the
representatives of all the mechanical

Foreign Minister Delcasse's efforts
have been to keep the affair within

overt act of British reprisals, which
might precipitate serious international
complications. These efforts are now
considered as having accomplished
their object. Delays in the future will
be those naturally incident to a dip

negotiations over these cases brought
the United States and France to ac

which the speakers urge moral resist

PORT SAID. July 23.â The Penin

here. She reports that the cruiser St.

too late for comment in most of the

the Tageblatt and the Post, however,
commented on the event and assumed
an indigant tone. The Tageblatt heads
its account: "Another Exhibition of
Russian Friendship," and says It be

Japanese lay mines at the harbor en
trance. The entrance to the port is now
clear.
The steamship Manchuria is making
a tour of the theater of war with mem
bers of the Japanese Diet, foreign at
taches and newspaper correspondents
on board.
The effect of the additional seizures
upon the British Government has been
to intensify its determination to settle
the status of the volunteer fleet ves
sels. It ls understood that the dis
patch of the British cruiser Venus to
the Rsd Sea and a number of torpedo
boats to Port Said is an earnest of the
Government's intention to protect com
merce. No warlike instructions have
been given the commanders, but the
Venus will closely watch the procedure
of the volunteer fleet vessels. Some
diplomatic circles regard this as being
in the nature of a threat to Russia, but
the Russian diplomats In London ex-*
press no concern.
Embassador Benckendorff, in his
communications to Foreign Secretary
Lansdowne, has not dealt with the
general question of the Dardanelles. It
is pointed out in Russian circles that
the subject is receiving consideration
In St. Petersburg, and it is asserted
that Russia will not abandon the right,
which Phe claims, to send volunteer
fleet vessels through the Dardanelles
and to transform them subsequently
into auxiliary cruisers, although no
more ships are likely"" to be sent out

The Scandia has aboard a consign
ment of ammunition, a portion of which
It is asserted was to have been landed
at Singapore for trans-shipment to Ger
man Government stations in the South
Seas. The other portion was billed to
Shanghai for the Chinese Government.
The presentation of a complaint at
Port Said Is difficult, owing to the fact
that the German Consul there also rep
resents Russia.
HAMBURG, July 23.â The officials of
the Hamburg-American line declare
that the seizure of their steamship
Scandia by the Russians is inexplicable,
as her manifests show she did not carry
any kind of war material for Japan.
The company has asked the Foreign
Office to take up the case and demand
an explanation. The company has made
the following statement:
"The capture of the Scandla appears
to be inexplicable. Her manifests show
that no war material in any form for
Japan was on b,oard. The Hamburg-
American Company at the beginning of
the war instructed its representatives
to make It their special duty not to ac
cept contraband for transmission. The
Hamburg - American Company has
asked the Foreign Office to initiate the
steps necessary to clear up this dis
agreeable Incident."
The Scandia belongs to the East In
dian service of the Hamburg- American
line.

Scandia's Seizure Is Inexplicable.

He proceeds to describe the advance

; At 9:30 o'clock In the morning the
Russian artillery opened fire on the

city Jail on a charge of forgery. Later
in the day she was released on a $4000

they have been traveling in Canada.
It is stated that while in Omaha Mrs.

RED CROSS FUNDS STOLEN".
BERLIN, July 23.â Fresh scandals of
enormous proportions have arisen In
connection with the management of the
Russian national Red Cross funds.
Eight million rubles (M.120.000) is miss
ing from the central treasury, prac
tically sweeping away all the cash
available for the needs of Kuropatkin' s
army.
The loss came to light in consequence
of the demand of the province of Cher
son for an acknowledgment of its con
tribution of 100,000 rubles ($51,600). An
investigation of the books In St. Peters
burg and Moscow revealed a discrep
ancy, which seems to be part of a sys
tem of thievery practiced since the be
ginning of the war.
Emperor Nicholas ls reported to be
enraged at the existence of such cor
ruption among the aristocratic classes
intrusted with the Red Cross arrange

ST. PETERSBURG, July 23.âGener

the â¢ Emperor that a detachment of
Russian troops commanded by Colonel
Tsybulsky gave battle In the Sybel
Pass on July 17 to a superior force of
Japanese. The engagement resulted In
LIAOYANG, Friday, July 22.â Two
Japanese divisions have tried to break
through Lieutenant General Count Kel
ler's left, but General Herschelman,
with the aid of reinforcements, made
a aucceseful stand. Details of the en
gagement are not yet known.
The Japanese have left only two divi
sions at Kaichou. These are strongly
Intrenched and on the defensive. Other
Japanese troops formerly at Kaichou
were embarked on transports for the
vicinity of Port Arthur. The capture
of that stronghold has become a vital
question for the Japanese. They have
been able hitherto- to adopt the offen
sive, but they realize that General
Kuropatkin himself will be prepared
soon to take the offensive and foresee
that they must have a â¢ strong naval
base. Port Arthur is the key to all
Japanese operations.
SINTZINTIN, seventy miles east of
Mukden, Manchuria, July 23.-^Accord
ing to reports from Chinese sources
Sigow Pass, ten miles north of Sai
matsza, is held by more than 5000 Jap
anese infantry and artillery. |lt is be
lieved that this column has engaged
the Russian force proceeding from Sai
matsza westward. The Japanese are
moving up their reserves to reinforce
the SIgow Pass column, which is ex
pected to push forward upon the ar
rival of the reinforcements. Heavy can
nonading was heard on July 18.
Reports to the effect that 20.000 Jap
anese have appeared at Hualyenship,
four miles to the east, are believed to
be Inventions spread by the Japanese,
with the aid of the Chinese.
Although it was authoritatively stated
yesterday that the Malacca had al
ready reached Suda Bay, It now trans
pires that when the Malacca sailed
from Port Said she was bound for Al
giers. Unless orders are delivered to
her on the way she will upon arriving
there find an order to proceed to Suda
Bay. where, under the agreement
reached by- Great Britain and Russia,
an examination of her cargo will be
made by the Russian and British Con
suls.
The apparent delay In the delivery of
orders to the captains of the St. Peters
burg and the Smolensk explains the
seizure of the Scandia and the Ardov.
Great Britain having formally raised
the question of the status of the St.
Petersburg and the Smolensk, the For
eign Office has called a meeting of lead-
Ing officials of the Admiralty to con
sider the subject. This conference is
now in progress. The difficulty will be
submitted to the Emperor.
The Russian Government has given
formal assurances to Germany that
there will be no repetition of the Prlnz
Heinrich incident. Whether this in
cludes aa definite notification that the
converted volunteer fleet steamships
now In the Red Sea will cease stopping
neutral vessels Is not yet clear, al
though It is believed It does.
While not admitting the illegality of
the action of the Russians In convert
ing vessels of the volunteer fleet Into
warships after they had reached the
Red Sea, it ls probable. In view of the
fact that neutral ships did not receive
previous notice, that Russia, in order
to remove the shadow of a cloud upon
their right to fly the war flag, will for
mally notify the powers of their con
version into warships, thus putting all
neutrals upon their guard. In the
meantime all the ships seized will be
released unless the captains refuse to
show their manifests, in which event
the procedure in the case of the Malac
ca will be followed.
ST. PETERSBURG, July 23.â Russia
has informally notified Great Britain
that orders have been issued to the
Russian cruisers In the Red Sea not to
arrest any more merchantmen, and it
has been agreed between the two pow
ers that if, pending the receipt of these
orders by the captains of the St. Peters
burg and the Smolensk, any other ships
should be stopped and held as prizes
these acts shall be regarded as not hav
ing taken place and the ships concerned
at once released.
The Foreign Office has cabled to the
German Consul at Port Said for an au
thentic version of the capture of the
Scandla and is awaiting his answer be
fore making representations at St.
Petersburg. The officials discuss the
case with an evident attempt to keep
cool, but they. betray deep-seated in
dignation at Russia's course. Germany
has no warships in the Red Sea and
the question of sending vessels there
has not yet been considered, but the
officials plainly intimate that this ques
tion must arise unless Russia speedily
order the captains of her volunteer fleet
steamships to cease molesting German
shipping. The officials refer to the en
ergetic language of the German press
as fully Justifiable. The seizure of the
Scandla is regarded as being so exces
sively unreasonable that the Govern
ment officials try to assume that the
captain of the Russian ship exceeded
his instructions and that Russia will
make speedy amends.
The Lokal Anzeiger regards the seiz
ure of the Scandia as being a much
more serious act of violence th*n the
Prlnz Heinrlch case.
"After England has obtained satis
faction so speedily. It would be a double
moral defeat for Germany If she could
not; compel the same respect aa the
English flag."
The Post, evidently verbally Inspired
by the Foreign Office,- characterizes the
seizure as another exhibition of Rus
sian recklessness and predicts it will
stir up much bad blood In Germany.
"It will." adds the Post, "make dip
lomatic relations between Russia and
Germany, which are already bad, much
worse."

different attitude toward Russia, add

rich food is believed to have brought
on the stroke Friday.

end on Wednesday, In company with
two friends, went to Red Mountain on
a prospecting and camping trip. After
making camp the men separated to
look for water. Held was unable to find
the camp again and for two days and
Eights he wandered in the mountain
canyons. His two companions searched
all that night for him. and came to
town Thursday to give the alarm. Res
cue parties at once started out from
town and searched without avail
throughout the day and night.

clothing was almost torn to shreds

and was almost completely exhausted.
SAN JOSE, July, 23.â Some novel
points will be raised In the probate of
the estate of Charles W. Stlckney and
Genevieve I. Stickney, his wife, who
were the principals in a tragedy at
Mountain View a few months ago.
Stickney killed hi'a wife and then com
mitted suicide. He left an estate of
about $3500. which is now being admin
istered upon. Public Administrator
Kell to-day nied a will made by Mrs.
Stickney and asked for letters of ad
ministration upon it. The will was
made In Custer County, Idaho, Decem
ber 15, 1Â£94, and by it she leaves what
property she may be possessed of after
death to her husband. The estate con
sists of a life insurance policy for $1500
and about $150 worth of Jewelry.
The question will be raised as to
whether Stickney or his wife died first
It is believed that he killed her at her
request, as she had before attempted
suicide. After shooting her he imme
diately turned the revolver upon him
self, eo the theorists say, and as the
bodies were not found until some time
after it is a question as to which ex
pired first. If the woman died first then
Stickney's relatives are the heirs to his
wife's estate, but if he expired first then
her relatives have a claim on the two
estates. Another question is as to
whether one who causes the death of
another intentionally can profit by that
person's death. There may also be a
contest of the life insurance policy on
the ground that she was killed for the
insurance.

club's officers, another meeting was
held for the purpose of naming an
other delegate to the county conven
tion and the selection of one for the

TUCSON, Ariz., July 23.â A masked
robber entered the Anheuser saloon
and gambling hall, a downtown resort,
shortly after midnight last night, and
covering Thomas Dickenson, the bar
tender, and a half-dozen men who were
drinking at the bar, ordered them to
turn over all the cash in their posses
sion. The men readily complied.
When the men had handed over a
considerable sum the robber stood
them up against the wall and walked
over to a roulette table, which was
running at the time. With two six
shooters lying within easy reach, he
swept the gold piled there into a sack
which he carled, and. picking up his
revolvers, made a break for a side en
trance and escaped into the darkness.
The barkeeper ran for his revolver
and sent several shots after the robber
as he ran under an electric light a half
block away and turned a corner The
police were immediately called, but the
desperado succeeded In giving them the
slip.
The Anheuser was held, up In much
the same manner two months ago by
Jim Smith, whom the bartender shot in
the leg as he was fleeing, bringing him
down. Smith Is now serving a term at
Yuma for the robbery.

quires that all members of the spin

ST. PAUL. July 23.â To-day's sit

the strike in Swift's plant in South
St. Paul has been broken. It is al
leged that great dissatisfaction exists
among the members of the union be
cause of the second strike order and
that a revolt against President Don
nelly's authority has occurred. Be
tween 500 and 600 union men are as
serted to be at work in the Swift
plant. The picket system seems to be
disorganized.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
At the stockyards to-night the pack
ers are making preparations for a long
struggle. As soon as all peace negotia
tions were declared futile the heads of
the different departments In the va
rious plants were notified to hire all the
Â¦workmen they could possibly obtain.
From the progress that has been made
up to a late hour to-night the indica
tions are that fully 2000 men will have
been engaged by to-raorrow night. -
It is the intention of the packers to
house the men in the plants. Ware
houses are being fitted with permanent
kitchens, bunks, etc., to accommodate
a total of L550 men, who. it Is claimed
by the packers, will be inside the
plants on Monday morning.
The strikers met at their various
union headquarters during the after
noon and night and listened to ad
dresses by their leaders, in which the
general strike, which seems already a
fixed programme for Monday, was the
only topic discussed.
Chief of Police O'Neill has sent in
calls for men from every precinct in
Chicago to report at the stockyards
station to-morrow to get acquainted
with the surroundings. Chief O'Neill
said to-night that the whole police
force of Chicago would be at the call
of the etockyards district on Monday
and that peace would be maintained at
any price.
Although the strikers were greatly
excited over the unsuccessful efforts to
settle the strike, there was little vio
lence throughout the district. The re
ceipts to-day were the lightest in the
and allied trades, and we stand ready
on our part to see that it is carried

White is now under guard and Smith
is detained In the post. What action
Colonel Markley Intends taking in the
matter is not known. He was much
disgusted at the June performances,
and if he had hi3 way at that time Loth
the offenders would have had summary
dismissal from the army.
It will be remembered that the pre
vious occurrences which aroused the
Indignation of the camp at Ansel Lsl
and was the introduction to that post
of two women, who Joined Lieutenants
White and Smith In an orgy which
lasted away into the night and set the
whole post wild with scandal. The fol
lowing morning Colonel Markley called
White and Smith before him and de
manded their resignations. In the
meantime Colonel Allen Smith came
out from the East in behalf of his Son
and matters were quieted down pend
ing a decision from the commander of
the department.
Colonel Markley la reported to be
greatly upset over these proceedings.
He ia very proud of his regiment, which
has always stood high in the country's
estimation. The recent scandals which
have emanated from its officers have
caused him much chagrin. The Rubic
ton case gave him much worriment.
Closely following upon the heels of this
came the suicide of the lamented and
brilliant young officer, Captain Fred
erick S. Wild. Now comes the denoue
ment in the shape of the White and
Smith affair.
The escapades of Lieutenants Charles
W. Smith and W. W. White, which
seemed to have reached their climax at
Ansel Island early in-June. are report
ed now to have been thrown entirely
Into the shade by their performances
last week. The June escapades, which
were the talk of the army circles at
that time, nearly caused both officers
to lose their commissions. Had it not
been for the pleadings of Colonel Allen
Smith of the Sixth Cavalry, the father
of onÂ« of the younir offenders, and the
clemency of General MacArthur, they
would have been court-martialed at
once. #
Their youth was pushed forward a*
an excuse, and upon the promises of
both offenders to reform General Mac-
Arthur allowed the matter to remain ia
abeyance.
His kindness and attempts to let
them hold their positions seem to have
been poorly rewarded by the reports
that now float out from the garrison at
Angel Island.
It i3 learned that one day early last
Â¦week one of the same women who had
been mixed up In the previous AnÂ»el
Island scandal again managed to work
her tray Into the post and up to the
quarters where Lieutenant White waa
stopping. Then the good old times be
gan again. Others are reported to have
Joined In the gay hilarity of the even-
Ing's gayeties. The popping of corks
was only a mild accessory to the gen
eral Joyousness of the occasion.
When the festivity was at its height
and the peace of the quiet camp was
being disturbed beyond all endurance
the officer of the guard appeared upon
the scene and demanded that an in
stant stop be put to the proceedings.
White, it Is claimed, became enraged
and drew his sword upon the officer,
but Lieutenant Smith went to the res
cue and any conflict of a serious na
ture was averted. This brought a close
to the carousal. Rumor has it that
White's female guest was scantily clad
at the moment the officer of the guard
burst in.

Clergyman Is Bitten by a Dog.
Weak with fright, the young husband
opened the door and staggered into the
room. His bride of a month was a rav
ing maniac The little utensils and
trinkets that had pleased her so much
were scattered and broxen, her pretty
hair was In disorder, her clothing was
almost torn from her body.
He spoke to her, but she snarled- In
reply. There was no trace of recogni
tion In her face. Shrieking, she order
ed him to leave the place, then, laugh-
Ing wildly, she went on In her work
of destruction. The broken-hearted man
had her removed on Friday night to
the Central Emergency Hospital. Yes
terday the Insanity Commission pro
nounced her case hopeless and she was
ordered to Stockton.
With hair disheveled and the sad.
absent look of insanity in her face,
Mrs. F. L. Baker, a bride of a few
weeks, was taken yesterday from the
detention ward at the City Hall to the
Stockton Insane Asylum. So ended her
honeymoon.
A month ago she became the wife of
F. L. Baker, an industrious yeung me
chanic. The man knew that there was
a taint of insanity in her family, but
he loved her. ' She. too, knew of the
shadow that hung over her and warned
her suitor. Baker replied that nothing
could come between them.
After the wedding the loving hus
band took his young wife to a com
fortable home he had made for her at
72 Ninth street. They were very happy
for a while. Mrs. Baker was a loving
and cheerful bride and the couple for
got that their happiness rested on an
unstable foundation. They/ were sav
ing to build a little cottage of their own
somewhere in the suburbs.
One evening Baker found his wife In
a rather pensive mood. He epoke sooth
ingly to her and she seemed to regain
her spirits. "I was thinking about my
mother and her trouble," said Mrs.
Baker. "But I won't think any more.
We'll Just be happy." So the skeleton
was locked in the closet â both thought,
forever.
On the next evening Baker found no
smiling wife to welcome him when he
returned from his work- He hurried
up the stairway, chilled with a terrible
fear. From the little kitchen where
the happy bride used to sing as she
cooked her husband's meals, came
sounds that resembled the snarling of
a wounded animal.

NEW YORK. July 23. â A joint
committee, representing importing in
terests, has completed a new schedule
of charges for storage, labor and cart
cge on general order goods. The old
schedule, which has been in effect
twelve years, contained many inequali-'
tics, acording to importers, and was a
feource of much complaint on their
part. The new schedule has been ap
proved by Collector Stranahan and
forwarded to the Treasury Depart

"I deny that." quickly retorted Bar
rett and the Judge said he did not wish
to discuss the matter and would con
tinue it for a week.
Whiting again asked for time to ex-*
amine the records and the Judge said,
significantly: "The most important
phases of the case are not a matter of
record."
Judge Dunne is still determined, if
possible, to- compel George T. Balllnger
to stand his trial on a charge of felony
embezzlement, although he has been
discharged on a writ of habeas corpus
by Judge Graham. Balllnger was book
keeper for the California Art Glass
Works, 120 Second street, and is ac
cused of having embezzled money be
longing to his employers.
When the case was called in Judge
Dunne's . court on Wednesday, Colonel
Barry, for the defendant, moved that
the, information 'be dismissed, as the
defendant had been discharged on a
writ of habeas corpus, but the Judge
denied the motion and continued the
case for trial till yesterday. He in
structed Assistant District Attorney
Whiting to look into Its status.
The case was recalled yesterday and
the defendant was represented by both
of his attorneys, Colonel Barry and
John J. Barrett. Barry renewed his
motion to dismiss the information and
offered in evidence the entire record of
the case. It showed that the writ had
been applied for on the morning of
May 5 before Judge Graham and was
made returnable at 2 o'clock that af
ternoon. The information was not
filed till 1 late that afternoon and the
return made by the District Attorney
to the application for the writ showed
that the defendant was held under the
commitment from the lower court.
"Why was the application for the
writ not made to the Presiding Judge
instead of to Judge Graham, who is a
civil and not a criminal Judge?" asked
Judge Dunne.
"I can answer that," replied Barrett,
"as I attended to the matter personal
ly. I simply followed the rule that
the application can be made to any
Judge of the Superior Court. The case
had not been at that time assigned to
any court because no information had
been filed. I ask that the information
be dismissed."
Assistant District Attorney Whiting
said he desired time to examine the
records and the law on the subject.
Barrett replied that he could see no
reason for delay aa the records spoke
for themselves. Besides, the question
whether Information was filed before
the application for the writ was made
should have been raised before Judge
Graham. It was too late now to
ask it.
Deputy County Clerks Doran and
Wells were called and swore that the
application for the writ was filed on
May 9 prior to the filing of the inform
ation. 'K- <

CALIFORNIANS AT THE FAIR.
Erwin Js trying to arrange to give
two free lectures a week in some of the
larger churches downtown. '\-ji
J. W. Erwin gave what is known as
his "Irrigation Lecture" to a crowd at
the San Francisco building the other
day. The various pictures showing the
rich fruitfulness of the soilâ golden
oranges and flaming grapes being
thrust right into the faces of the spec
tators, with an invitation to "take all
they wantedâ were greeted with "Ohs!"
and "Ahs!" and one man among the
spectators exclaimed at the close of the
series of pictures, "I move we all go to
California," to which a lady replied, "I
move, any way, that we all want to go
there."
The last carload of exhibits for the
San Francisco building has arrived and
the installation work, under the super
vision of George P. Wilcomb, custodian
of the building, is nearly finished. The
upper floor of the building, which has
been practically empty, now contains a
handsome display that will add to the
pleasure of visitors and do credit to
San Francisco.
The representatives of the various
California counties exhibiting at the
exposition have promised Captain Har
ris, in charge of the Kings County dis
play, that they will send home for lan
tern slides of typical farming scenes
in their localities to be used in the
stereopticon lectures he has offered to
give free of charge at ' the California
building during the rest of the fair. He
will be enabled when these slides come
to give lectures covering the State from
end to end and showing its resourced
and fertility. Properly colored slides
show up scenes of orchard, garden and
field in an impressive manner.

The thermometer here has not gone
above 92 this summer. The St. Louis
people admit that this is an unusual
condition at this season of the year.
Strangely enough, they are better sat
isfied when the mercury has its eye
on the hundred mark than when it is
below 90, for under the latter condi
tion humidity prevails. When the
thermometer is higher the mugginess
Is not so noticeable. It is when the
thermometer runs from 83 to S7,
which reads nicely out in California
and brings a suggestion of pleasurable
existence with it, that the California
visitors suffer and wonder whatever
induced them to leave home. They
get a Hammam at that temperature.
It's fine for the complexion, but it
breeds profanity.
Californians and other far Westerners
coming here now will need- some little
time to get acquainted with the various
kinds of bugsâ fortunately all large and
therefore easily watchedâ that make St.
Louis their home at this season of the
year. Once the acquaintance is formed
the visitor feels at his ease, for the
bugs are a sociable lot and without
guile. They don't pick out one's -neck
as a promenade any more than any
other place. It only seems so. A Cali
fornia woman when she first reaches
up and finds one of these leviathans of
the entomological world crawling about
her shoulders usually tries to Jump
through a car window; but she gets
used to them, like everybody else, and,
like others, finds herself trying to de
termine how many varieties there are.
LAST EXHIBITS ARRIVE.
ST. LOUIS, July 23. â The influx of
people from California and neighbor
ing States is lessening somewhat as
the weather grows warmer. The
greatest tide of travel from there will
probably set in in September and con
tinue through the three closing
months- of the exposition, when the
weather is said to be very fine in St.
Louis and the Middle West generally.
The greatest number of visitors to the
exposition are now 'coming frÂ«m the
Middle Western and Southern States.
The people of New York arid Chicago,
where the patrol wagons and ambu
lances keep up a constant clatter in
response to heat prostration calls,
where dozens of stricken people die
daily in the hospitals and the poorer
classes hang out of tenement win
dows by their toes and sleep on fire
escapes to get a little fresh air, are
keeping away from St. Louis, where
heat prostration is practically un
known, because "it is too awfully hot
down there." Other cities on the At
lantic seaboard, where the heat is just
as bad aa in New York and Chicago,
are wailing for it to get cooler in St.
Louis.
ST. IX>UIS HEAT NOT BAD.
By Paul Edwards.
A letter giving great satisfaction at
Rosemount has been received by Judge
Parker from Carl Schurz. It is as fol
lows:
"My Dear Sirâ Not as a party man.
but as an independent, I feel bound to
express to you my sincere respect. The
principles and opinions you are known
to hold as to the currency, Imperialism,
tariff and the civil service strongly
commend themselves to men of my way
of thinking. But if, as an independent,
I was ever doubting for what candidate
my duty commanded me to vote, your
action on the terms of your nomination
has completely solved that- doubt. It
has rendered to the republic double
service of incalculable value. No man
can honestly deny that it has demol
ished the last pretext for still treating
the gold question as a live Issue of
party controversy, and that it has thus
relieved the business community of an
element of peculiarly unhealthy agita
tion and dangerous uncertainty. This
is so evident that to continue that agi
tation artificially for mere party ad
vantage must be condemned by every
good citizen as absolutely wickedâIn
deed, as little less than criminal. '
"And. secondly, the manly declaration
that you would accept the offered nom
ination for the Presidency only If the
offer came In harmony with your sense
of public duty has set up before the
American people one of those noble
standards of moral courage and civic
virtue of wjiich our public life stands
so much in : need. The higher you lift
that standard the higher you will rise
in the esteem and confidence of your
countrymen, and the more surely they
will hold you worthy of their highest
trust." .
ESOPUS. July 23.-Judge Parker has
fixed "August 10 as the date for the cere
monies notifying him of his nomination
by the Democratic National Conven
tion as a candidate for the Presidency.
Judge Parker* reached a decision con
cerning the date in a long consultation
with William F. Sheehan yesterday,
and a telejrram was at once sent to
Champ Clark of Missouri, chairman of
the committee named by the Democrat
ic Convention to notify the nominee for
President. Representative Clark is ex
pected to call a meeting of his commit
tee, probably to be held in New York,
and he may also come to Itosemount
to talk over the arrangements with
Judge Parker, although no plan for
such a conference has yet been made.
The programme for the ceremonies at
Rosemount on August 10 will follow
precedents laid down for similar events.
It is known that Judge Parker is im
pressed with the simplicity of the cere
monies which took place on the occa
sion of President Lincoln's second nom
ination, and also when Judge Thurman
was informed of his nomination for
Vice President. The speeches both times
were marked by their brevity. When
President Cleveland was notified in 18S8
he made a long speech and the ceremo
nies were far more formal than any
others which have been brought to the
attention of those who are arranging
the details of the Rosemount ceremo
nies. It is the plan now at Rosemount
to have the notification follow closely
the fofm of the earlier ceremonies. It
is not exDected that Judge Parker will
talk at length nor that he will discuss
intimately any of the campaign issues,
but\will leave this to the letter of ac*
ceptance, which will be issued a week
or so later.
O'Brien has two bullets in his leg.
but his condition is not regarded as
serious. The fourth man, Kempsey,
escaped without injury, although his
hat was pierced by a bullet.
In a statement made to the
police after his arrest Miller said that
the woman told him that four men
had Insulted her and struck her over
tix* head with a beer can. He then
went out to avenge her and finding the
four men he "pumped them full of
lead," he is said to have told the po-
Martin. who was shot in the abdo
men, died soon after reaching the hos
pital. It was found there that Healy's
condition was serious and that he had
no more than an even chance of re
covery.
All the parties to the affair are resi
dents of the upper East Side. Accord-
Ing to the story told the police by
those who had part in the encounter,
the 'Vrhalen woman encountered Mar
tin, HeaJy. O'Brien and a man named
Kempsey near One Hundred and Ninth
street to-day, and. after passing a few
Â¦words with them. Miller appeared
suddenly from across the street and
began firing. Three of the four men
fell. Miller then fled and was found
eome time later by detectives in bed
at his home.

Horses Suffer From Sores.
S. C. Switzer, driver of a scraping
team for the firm of Harney & Mc-
Hugh, was arrested yesterday by Of
ficers McCurry and Unger of the So
ciety for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals. The horses seemed to be
behaving badly and on examination
the officers found large sores beneath
the coUar of each horse. The animals
were removed to Peters' stables.

below the rvater line and the pumps
were set to work, as it was known
that on several occasions rats had en
dangered some of the pontoons by
gnawing holes near the water line.
As the old vessel continued to sink.
In spite of the measures taken to
pump out the water, the men were
ordered to leave her.
She very quickly sank another six
teen feet deeper In the water, when a
swarm of rats swam out from the
doomed pontoon, which five minutes
later -Hded noiselessly from sight. No
lives were lost.

CONSTANTINOPLE, July 23. â Two
Persian Princes, the brother and a
son of the Shah, are here under fic
titious names at a hotel In the Pera
quarter. The Persian embassy soon
discovered their identity and the
Princes are now closely watched. It
seems that after the discovery of an
extensive conspiracy against the Shah,
in which the Princea were implicated,
they resolved to take safety in flight.
Before they reached the Russian fron
tier they were discovered by Persian
agents and two of their three servants
and their cash box were seized. They,
however, succeeded in escaping across
the frontier and came to this city In
order to obtain from the Sultan per
mission to enlist as officers of the
army. Prince Risa-Khan, the Persian
Embassador, has just informed the
Yildiz kiosk that.jthe two Princes are
rebels and have heen deprived of their

Franciska Bruckner yesterday peti

who died on May 17, 1904, leaving an
estate valued fit about $2500. She
states that John Becker was named as
executor in the will, but he has been
living in Japan for some time and she
does not know when he will return.
Therefore she claims her appointment
is necessary in order to hasten the
settlement of the estate.
Executor In Japan.
VIENNA, July 23.â Not ooe of the
recent court scandals has caused such
profound dismay and indignation as
the reckless behavior of the beautiful
Â¦woman for whom the universally re
spected imperial official, Hervay von
Klrchberg, blew out his brains.
Fear that the woman might find
some means of escaping punishment,
as she has done so often before, caused
one of her husbands â the fourth â to
write to the newspapers what he knows
of her, in the hope of warning all fu
ture admirers. He asserts that she was
born in I860 in LIssa, Prussian Poland,
the daughter of a conjuror named
Bellach, who called himself Bellachini,
whom old residents of Vienna remem
ber well as a successful and comical
performer.
The indiscreet husband, who signs
himself "M.," eays that to his certain
knowledge she was married five times.
Her first husband, he says, was a
commercial traveler, whose name be
gan with a "K." He got a divorce on
the ground of unfaithfulness.
She was so successful in all her in
trigues that she became more and more
daring, and when Baron Lutzow, her
second husband, divorced her, she
turned up in another German city,
called herself "Baroness de Shave,"
and made people believe by insinuation
that she was the natural daughter of
the Grand Duchess Vladimir of Rus
sia.
She got her third husband, an Aus
trian dragoon officer, spouse No. 4 al
leges, by fainting plump in his arms in
a # public square full of people.
*She left him after having spent
every florin he owned and exhausted
his credit.
While the divorce case with her
fourth husband was going on she was
engaged to be married to First Lieu
tenant "Von C." But this young
officer had a very, energetic colonel,
who found out what kind of a woman
hi3 "subordinate was so anxious to
marry; and Krna Bellach, alias Baron
ess Lutzow, had to leave in sreat haste
for fear of consequences. Her next
sweetheart was an Austrian officer,
with whom she went to spend the sum
mer in Murr, between Graz and Vienna.
As soon as she saw she had made an
impression upon the man in the high
est ofnee in' the small provincial town
she dismissed her admirer and set her
cap for poor Von Klrchberg. She mar
ried him, arrayed in magnificent bridal
robes and adorned with many jewels,
which >she said were the family gems
of th(/Lutzows and worth $2,500,000' *
When the was told of her husband's
death she shrugged her shoulders and
only said:
"Such things cannot be helped. Fools
will be fools."

WOMAN'S INJURIES
It is contended that at the time
of hi3 death Dyson D. Was3 was in
possession of property belonging to his
brother. In June. 1888, Dyson was
appointed as Frederick's guardian and
represented at that time that the
brother was an Incompetent and had
sold an estate at Astoria, Or., for one
flfth of Its value.
In her petition the cousin declares
that Frederick Wass waa next of kin
and entitled to all or a part of Dyson's
estate, and furthermore Dyson, had
used Frederick's property and mingled
it with his own in business. He had
never rendered an accounting oi his
guardianship.
Attorney de Golia has not given up
the battle against the estate of the
late Dyson D. Wass for a share for
the dead man's incompetent brother,
Â¦whose present whereabouts is un
known. Recently the Superior Court
granted letters of administration to
Isabella M. Wass, who proved her
claim as the commoh law wife* of the
rich electrical contractor. Attorney
de Golia yesterday, -on behalf of Lu
cretia Anderson, a cousin of the Wass
brothers, filed a petition for appoint
ment as guardian of the person and
estate of Frederick William Waas. in
whose behalf Mrs. Wass' contentions
were previously contested.

NEW CONTEST STARTED
IX DYSON WASS ESTATE
Thinking that Coyle was informing
the Judge of the matter of the pack
age, Murphy broached the subject and
it all came out. The Judge declined
to interfere with the Sheriff's order.
Murphy demanded that the letters be
read in open court, as he was satisfied
there was nothing wrong in them.
Deputy Welsh said he would not part
with them, but would hand them over
to the chief jailer. The Judge held
that the prisoner was In the custody of
the Sheriff and Welsh had a perfect
right to retain possession of the pack
age. He suggested that a dentist
might be sent to the Jail, but that was
for the Sheriff to decide.
After Chadwick was taken back to
the jail the package was examined by
the chief Jailer, who found nothing
unusual and handed it back to Chad
wick.
The prisoners had been brought
from the County Jail, to court and
were waiting in the dock till the
Judge made his appearance. Deputy
Welsh was sitting in front of the dock
with his back toward the prisoners
and did not .observe the woman's ac
tion, but it did not escape the notice
of Deputy Coyle, who waa standing in
the rear of the courtroom. He at once
went to the dock and asked Chadwick
to give him the package his wife had
handed to him. Chadwick Insolently
refused and the two deputies made a
movement toward him. He grappled
with them and was quickly thrown to
the floor and the package taken from
his pocket by Deputy Welsh. \ The
other prisoners looked calmly on and
seemed to enjoy Chadwick's discom
fiture.
After the Judge had taken his seat
on- the bench and Chadwick's case,
charging him with sending by tele
graph a false and forged message, was
called, Attorney Murphy asked for a
continuance' of a week. This was^
granted. Murphy then asked that
Chadwick be allowed to go to a den- :
tist for four or five days. Deputy
Coyle informed the Judge that Chief
Jailer Sullivan had telephoned to him
that Sheriff Curtisa had refused per
mission for Chadwick to leave the jail
for a dentist's office.
Ernest Moore Chadwick, alias "Sir"
Harry Westwood Cooper, offered stub-_
born resistance to two deputy sher
iffs in the dock in Judge Lawlor's
courtroom yesterday morning. He
was unceremoniously thrown to the
floor and although he struggled fierce
ly, a bundle of letters which his wife
had slipped into his hands .was taken
from him.
Morgue Surgeon Bacigalupi made
an autopsy yesterday morning and
found that death had been caused by
suffocation. The lungs contained con
siderable sand. The stomach and con
tents were sent to the City Chemist.
Dr. Bacigalupi is of the opinlnn that
Mrs. Weaver fell in a fit face down
ward and was suffocated.
Thomas Turner of 733 Natoma
street informed Deputy Ahern that he
met Mrs. Weaver on the beach at 4
o'clock Friday afternoon. She
seemed to be ill and he assisted her
to the park railroad depot, where she
was taken with vomiting and began
to cry, saying that she was very sick.
She also told Mr. Turner that she had
Just come from her home in Stockton
and that she had no friends in this
city. He then left her and did not see
her again until he recognized her lying
on a slab In the Morgue.
Mrs. Li. B. Seymour of 2658B Mar
ket street and Mrs. A. Fautz of 2021
University avenue, .Berkeley, called at
the I.Jergue yesterday and identified
the body of the young woman found
on the Cliff House bfeach_last Friday
evening as that of Mrs. Anna B.
Weaver, wife of a San Joaquin County
farmer, living near Stockton. Mrs.
Seymour i3 the mother and Mrs. Fautz
the sister of the dead woman. They
informed Deputy Ahern that Mrs.
Weaver, whose maiden name was
Anna McCoy, had been for years sub
ject to epileptic fits, which had made
her very despondent, and that she had
threatened to take her life. She came
to this city from Stockton last Sun
day.

Vandilla Schantz wants a divorce
from John George Pchantz on the
ground of neglect. They were married

James S. Bailey, the soapmaker, yes
terday filed an answer to 'the suit of
Lyda E. R. Bailey, who sued for di
vorce after five months of marriage on
the ground of cruelty, including a
charge of personal uncleanliness. Bailey
not only denies all of her charges, but
says that she Induced him to marry
her and afterward was cruel to him
and inhumano'to his adopted daughter.
He declares that Mrs. Bailey as a paid
housekeeper took excellent care of the
house, but as his wife she neglected
her household duties until the place waa
not fit to live in. He even says that
his wife of a few months tried to poi-
Bon him by mixing narcotics with his
food and drink.
It is not set forth that he criticized
the r>ie because it was not one "like
mother used to make," but it is averred
In particularity of detail that his face
and clothing "were bespattered with
soft lemon custard." The oie was a
comparatively harmless weapon to the
one she is alleged to have used on June
29, when she is said to have struck

Believing himself to be a, victim of
a get-rich-quick scheme, IT. F. Hob
son yesterday commenced suit In the
Superior Court for the appointment of
a receiver for the Pacific States Mer
cantile Company and for the recovery
of 54525 invested in 374 of the con
cern's "merchandise contracts." Hob
son's attorneys are L. G. Carpenter
and F. W. Sawyer.
The complaint throws considerable
light upon the company's methods and
makes the declaration that in order to
evade its obligations the "mercantile"
combination has caused the organiza
tion of two other corporations, to
which It Intends to transfer Its prop
erty, stock and assets.
Hobson alleges that the business of
the defendant company is contrary to
public policy and he says that it Is
guilty of fraud in that its contracts
cannot mature. He says that the
Postofflce Department has instituted
proceedings to shut the company out
of use of the mails and that within the
last few days four suits brought on
matured contracts have shown that
the concern cannot pay Its obligations.
It is further declared that the At
torney General of the State has been
requested to start proceedings for the
revocation of the license of the com
pany and it is believed that the action
will be instituted, but Hobson says
that before that time the company
will get rid. of its assets unless a re
ceiver i3 appointed.
Hobson avers that it has been the
object of the company to sell as many
contracts as possible and then cir
culate stories as to its Insolvency in
order to cause defaults of Installments.
A sample contract is given as an ex
hibit in the suit, from which it ap
pears that the company's plan was to
give $100 worth of merchandise for
$50. It was required that 85 down
should be paid and installments of
$1 50 a week for thirty weeks. On
default the contract was voided, but
those who had made all jthe payments
could get $100 /worth of merchandise
or the company would agree to sell
the stuff for $Â£5. Out of the payments
the company retained the 55 for its
own use and, 25 per cent additional.
Ten per cent went into the reserve
fund and the balance into the "re
demption fund" for the purchase of

Trouble is brewing in the Public
School Department as a result of the
filing of charges by Joseph O'Connor,
principal of the Mission High School,
against Albert M. Armstrong, head of
clasiscs In the same school. The
charges were recently filed by O'Con-
nor with Alfred Roncovieri, president
of the Board of Education, and with
Superintendent Langdon, who has
them ' under investigation and < will
shortly report thereon to the board.
Roncovieri left his copy of the
charges locked up in his desk before
he went East and Superinte'ndent

nature before he has made h's of

ever, that the charges concern the

two educators have reached such a
stage that O'Connor declares It is im
possible for him to get along with his
subordinate in a way that would re
dound to the best interests of the
school and he therefore requests the
Board of Education to transfer Arm

crisis suddenly developed in the rela
tions between Russia and Great Brit
â¢ain over the seizure of vessels in the
Red Sea revived all the worst poten
tialities of a spread to the great pow
ers of Europe of the armed conflict In
progress in the Far East At the meet
ing of the Northern Securities directors
the unceremonious refusal to even con
sider a proposition looking
! to a settlement of the dispute between
stockholders out of court gave strong
ground for an assumption that the is
sue between the two parties for the
control of Northern Pacific and of the
Northwestern railroad situation can
only be settled by the succes of one
or the other party.
There Is no question In American
financial circles which has caused so
much dread and anxiety as this. Yet
this week's incident had a stimulating
effect rather than otherwise upon the
market. The blunt assertion by the
leading organ in the iron trade that
the improvement had been taking place
chiefly in Wall street did not prevent
United States Steel preferred from sup
plying one of the principal sustaining
influences in the market. The damage
to the wheat crop in the Southwest was
similarly ignored on the Stock Ex
change. In looking back over the re
cent upward movement It is easy to
perceive what a dominant influence has
been played by Union Pacific. The di
mensions of the transactions and the
extent of the movement In this stock
1 carry conviction that the insiders and
banking interests in the property were
concerned in the dealings. This Involves
one of the principal groups of capital
ists which make up the dominant con
trol of the great railroad and financial
Institutions of the country. So signal a
demonstration of confidence In future
values as was implied by this opera
tion undoubtedly did more to Instill a
feeling of confidence into the general
temper than any independent study of
conditions and the drawing of infer
ences could supply. The advance has
proceeded under the confident assump
tion that it was following well-Informed
leadership.
The plethora of the money market
has been a contributing cause. Some
anomalies in the money situation have
not escaped discussion, however. The
congestion in New York Js seen to be
largely influenced by conditions in the
local banking situation which are the
outgrowth of the prosperous period of
the last few years and the large In
crease in banking: competition. Induce
ments to deposit both by outside banks
and trust companies and by Individual
depositors remain in force in the pres
ent stagnant money-market and throw
the burden upon the New York banks
of finding employment for idle reserves
In order to meet the charges for Inter
est allowed, while also Increasing the
obligations upon them for meeting ulti
mate reserve requirements.
Obligations by New York banks to
other banks and bankers are larger
even than usual, so that interior^ needs
for the crop movement will' enable out
side banks to draw more freely than
usual on New York reserves. The large
, increase In th'e taxes of Government ex
penditures over receipts has led to a
semi-official Intimation that the treas
ury will not be able to afford relief to
the money market this autumn and the
depletion of the Government's avail
able cash balance even leads to the dis
cussion of a possible necessity of with
drawal of Government deposits from
the banks. The war scare has also led
to a hardening of foreign exchange.
But the significance of the accompany
ing news of the shipment of a million
dollars in gold from Australia to San
Francisco Is not to be lost sight of.
The demand for remittance from New
York may be regarded as based In part
upon the expected receipt at San Fran
cisco of this gold.
There has been occasional hesitation
manifested in the bond market, but the
tone has been good. United States
bonds are unchanged on call from last
week.
'As a result of the recent State
Christian Endeavor Convention he.ld
In Santa Rosa, where the grand chorus
of over one hundred voices was such
a feature, the young people j of San
Franci3co are organizing a chorus for
this city. It will be known as the
Masterpiece Choral and will be under
the direction of Professor Carl Saw
veil, who directed the Santa Rosa
chorus. A call has been issued, signed
by the president of Golden Gate
Christian Endeavor Union. J. W.
Hatch; president of the Epworth
League Alliance, Percy F. Morris;
ex-State President 'J. E. White and
half a dozen prominent pastors of the
c!ty. The purpose ia to improve the
music of the churches, the voices of
the singers and give sacred concerts.
The proceeds above expenses will be
devoted to charitable work. The first
concert will bo given about Thanks

Â¦While the week's market has shown
many signs cf instability and prices
have wavered constantly, the move
ment was as constantly stopped short
of a precipitate decline. The effect has
been to impress sentiment with the
strength of the forces behind the mar
ket and to encourage hopes of an early
resumption of the advance. The email
r-fTect produced upon prices by hap
r-osings which seem to have a positive
bearing against values has the same
encouraging effect. One of the most
notable features of the present rise in
prices has been the indifference toward
new developments. Thus during the
past week there were numerous inci
dents that would have upset specula
tive confidence in an ordinary period
ef doubt and uncertainty. Monday
morning brought a set of opinions from
Western raliroad traffic officials which
plainly admitted their apprehen
tion that the crop damage had caused a
halt In the revival of confidence In
business, which threatened another pe
riod of hesitation and curtailment, with
resultant effect on railr/aad traffic. The
ThÂ» bank statement reflected al! of
the expected gain in cash reserves and
carried that item, as well as loans ajid
deposits, to new record figures. As
nearly haif cf the Increase in deposits
was In cash there was a margin of In
crease In the surplus of over 55,000.000.
bringing that item to the unusual fig
ure of ?SO,60S.CO0. The offering of call
loans this week to below 1 per cent is
thus easily understood. The market
closed irregular and at small changes.
Total sales of bonds, par value,
$1,053,000.
The stock has been very irregular
throughout the week and its occasional
Etrensth has been manifested In a very
speedy manner. The impression made
upon speculative sentiment, hrv.vever,
has been to increase confidence in the
underlying strength. Professional oper
atcrs have held to en opinion that a
normal reaction after the considerable
rise in prices was overdue, and the
attitude toward the -market has been
one cf constant suspicion. It is usual
for the securities market to be left toJT-^
heavy after so considerable a specula
tion for the advance as that which has
tarried prices to their present level, and
the :lrst sign of reaction is likely to
I rir.g upon the market a flood of be
lated profit-taking or sales by specula
tive buyers at the top to save losses,
â¢with the sold-out bulls adding sales on
the short side to force the reaction and
get back stocks at a lower level.
BTREXGTH IS POWERFUL.
NEW YORK. July 23.-A marked
subsidence of speculative interest was
observed In to-day's stock market,
partly attributable to the short session
end the rush from the city for the er.d
week holiday. But the limit to the pres
ent active movement was pretty
clearly thov.-n by the dullness yester
day. There wfes the same hesitation of
prices to-day, but the undertone -waa
firm end there "was little pressure to
sell, simply a cessation of the recent
large buying in different Quarters of
the list. The settlement of the incident
of the Russian seizures in the Red Sea
seemed eo -well defined as to leave lit
tle ground for uneasiness. It is prob
able, however, that some repressive ef
fect Is still felt, from the sudden possi
bilities of trouble developing by the in
cident. The only feature in to-day's
market vas the special firmness of the
Iron and steel stocks. United States
Steel preferred added 7-S to its week's
fain and the stocks of the independent
companies made some sharp advances.
Rumors emanated from' the neighbor
hood of the meeting of presidents of
the United States Steel subsidiary com
panies, which. Increased the conjectural

LONDON. July 23.â George Meredith,
the father of contemporary English
letters, has been giving vigorous ex
pression to his opinion on current af
fairs.
Regarding journalism he said: "It is
most likely that practical Journalists,
like practical politicians, will have to
go largely on opportunist lines. Though
most of my work has been imaginative,
I have done a certain amount of jour
nalism and I recognize its difficulties.
But it has extraordinary power, too,
and great opportunity for fine influ
ence. It has almost taken the place of
government.
"It is true that the editorials in near
ly all the newspapers have fallen off
very much only quite recently In power
and character. I don't know what the
reason for that Is, but still newspapers
have very great Influence.
"The power and functions of govern
ment are undoubtedly diminishing. I
don't know whether we 'shall reach the
time when there will be no government
at all, as some people hope, but cer
tainly that is the tendency. Tyranny,
which is the complete form of govern
ment, has been tried and proved to be
impossible. We shall never have that
again unless the democracy betrays it
self."
George Meredith, the Father of Con
temporary British Letters, Dis
cusses Newspaper Influence.
SAYS JOURNALISM ALMOST
TAKES GOVERNMENT'S PLACE
own canoe."
"I have been unable to give the
British Government any hope that the
treaty to which it lent support will be
ratitied by the United States. New
foundland is and has been anxious to
secure reciprocity upon a mutually
advantageous basis with our great,
friendly neighbor. To secure that end
I have made every effort consistent
with the dignity and interest of tho
colony. More than this, Newfound
land has given American fishermen
during fourteen years rights which it
has power to withhold. It has been
a matter of comment in connection
with Joseph Chamberlain's campaign^
that Newfoundland gives America
greater privileges than the mother
country.
"The next movement in the matter
must be on the part of America. In
the untoward event of our failing to
secure any measure of reciprocity it
may become necessary â although I
hope it never will, to put into execu
tion those differentiating tariffs, which
the other British colonies have enacted
against foreign countries. The adop
tion of our 33U per cent preferential
tariff in favor of British manufactured
goods would turn the whole of our
business with the United States over
to Canada. Newfoundland has not so
far adopted this preferential tariff be
cause it was thought that sooner or
later the United States â both from the
viewpoint of self-interest . and in re
turn for a material sign of genuine
friendship, would enact the reciprocal
agreement. It would be absurd for
me to say this as in any sense threat
ening a tariff war.
"It was not a question of reprisals,
but the people of Newfoundland can
not be expected to let this remain an
open question forever, when every
body on the island knows that Amer
ica is trading under advantages not al
lowed by any other British colony, and
while Newfoundland products entering
the United States are taxed to almost
a prohibitive degree."
Sir Robert Bond has given the Brit
ish Government a frank expression
of the views regarding the suggested
confederation with Canada. When
questioned on this subject. Sir Robert
replied:
"I am strongly opposed to any such
amalgamation. Newfoundland neither
desires nor needs confederation. There
are no advantages to us in s\ich an ar
rangement compared with the disad
vantages It would entail. There is no
such movement worth mentioning on
foot in New Foundland. The oldest
British colony can maintain the most
pleasant relations with her Canadian
sister, but she intends to paddle her
LONDON, July 23. â Sir Robert
Bond, Premier of Newfoundland,
sailed for home to-day on the steamer
Buenos Ayrean from Liverpool, after
having settled up Newfoundland's
share in the Anglo-French treaty.
Interviewed on the subject of the
Hay-Bond treaty, which is awaiting
ratification by the Senate, the Premier
said:
People Seek for Reciprocal

TYPICAL TRANSACTIONS.
NEW YORK, July 23.â After nearly
two years' imprisonment between brick
j walls four stories high and only a little
i more than three Inches apart, a cat has
Â¦ been rescued by means of a lariat. The
i feline dropped into the crevice when it
I was only a few weeks old and has been
there ever since, fed and cared for by
families residing in the buildings.
The orison which it occupied so long
j is between two buildings on East
Fourth street. The crcvic^ is closed
front and back, and even partly closed
on the top by tin rooflng. Efforts, which
the kitten made again and again during
the early days of Its imprisonment to
j climb up these slippery walls, only to
I fall back, were watched with sympathy
! by the neighbors.' and they became di
} vlded into factionsâ those who thought
j that the kitten ought to be killed and
: relieved of its misery, and those who
J held that while there was life there was
! hope. The latter fed the cat and gave
! it water by means of a long string. Dis
: contented neighbors many times threw
' in chunks of poisoned liver, but the
; animal never touched it. Meanwhile the
cat grew and every effort was made to
' release it, but without success. A few
j days ago the story became generally
! known and came to the notice of an ex
! cowboy, who with an old lariat soon
: dragged the cat from Its prison, thus
I removing a source of much worry to
; the Society for the Prevention of Cru
i elty to Animals.

A gentleman called upon me a few
djiy? apo to ask me about my cure of
rheumatism. My cure has attracted con-
EidTabl<* attfntion. Kimply becatrse my
<-ase was probably about the worst case
that ever vuzzled the doctors of San
Frar.r-isco arid Oakland. I am an old
resident of California â have lived in
eight of S.m Francisco for forty-nine
years. I kept a grocery store at
the corner of Fourth and Webster streets
in Oakland for twenty years. I am pret-
ty -*ell known. Many know that I was
comr-Mlf-d to give up my grocery busl-
n^y.s dimply because rheumatism crippled
r e up so I could not walk, could not
dresa mnelC hardly feed myself; so to
all ir.tent and purpose, rheumatism par-
alyzed me.
Wasn't I a feast for the doctors, and
didn't I uiakf an apothecary shop of my
stomach, all to no avail? Doctors and
rnedioin^s never did me any good. I am
a well man now and a happy man. No
mor<* pains, no more swollen Joints, no
mere stiit and aching liraLs. I can walk
twenty miles if I want to. It seems liice
It Is too good to be true, yet I was cured
in a few Wffks. and at a trifling ex-
pense, at the Elpctro-Chemlc Institute.

A resident of 'Castle Valley, Penn.,
has a vine that showed itself last
month to have. If not a brain, a substi
tute of equal value. This vine, a young
one, grew in a clay pot. A stick stood
in the middle of the pot and the vine
curled up it. It was about two feet In
height; in length, uncurled,' it would
have measured four feet.
Usually the vine was placed in a
south window every morning, where it
absorbed all day the benefit of the sun's
rays. It happened, however, through
an oversight, that one afternoon a
shutter shaded half the window and
the vine was set in the shutter's
shadow. A foot away was the sun
light, warm, glittering, life-giving, but
where the plant stood_ there was noth
ing but gloom.
During the four days the vine stood
in theNhadow with the sunlight near
it, it did something that proved it to
have a faculty akin to intelligence. It
uncurled itself from its supporting
stick and like a living thing it crawled
over the window ledge to the sun.
This vine, to be sure, did not uncurl
itself and^crawl with. the rapid move
ments of a snake. Its movements were,'
Indeed, so slow as to be. Imperceptible.
Nevertheless, looking aoout, It over
came every obstacle and finally it lay
barking in the sun.â Portland Oregon

IF the figuring of the usually reliable Portland Ore
gonian is correct as applied to the grain yield in the
northwest Whitman County, Washington, the banner
wheat section, will pay wheat farmers not more than $4
per acre, net, this year. The county's gross wheat pro
duct is estimated at 10,000,000 bushels, which ought to
bring in $5,000,000 on a conservative estimate. The price
per bushel indicated in this computation is accepted by
the Oregonian as reasonable. Whitman County, sparsely
settled, would seem to* be entitled to congratulations be
cause of the large amount ~oi ready money that will come
to hand for wheat. The Oregonian, however, makes the
showing a text upon which it argues that the time has
come for the wheat kings of the northwest to abdicate.
California wheat farmers will be interested in the facts.
There are 450,000 acres in wheat in Whitman County.
The custom in the Palouse country is to summer, fallow.
Including the area in summer fallow the total extent of
the land that is tied up by the wheat crop of 10,000000
bushels is 800,000 acres in round figures. In other words
it requires 800,000 acres to produce a crop that is worth
$5,000,000. This is at the* average rate of but $6.25 per
acre gross. Counting in the cost of seed, labor, thresh
ing, harvesting and sacking and excluding the labor per
formed by the farmers and their families the net in
come per acre is estimated at $4, which is about as small
a profit as could possibly be derived from any method at
all resembling intelligent agriculture. As regards the
season it is exceptional in yield and the prices are quite
remunerative.
Colfax is the center of the Whitman County wheat
belt. It is, so the Oregonian admits, a prosperous city,
with a nuifrber of rich citizens, and its banks are filled
with the gold of the wheat kings, "but it was fully as
prosperous and had nearly as large a population a dozen
years ago as it has now. It Â» has reached- its limit of

Because a deputy sheriff of Los Angeles wanted to go
deer hunting and did one of the most desperate schemes
ever hatched to liberate a murderous prisoner on his
way to San Quentin was 'recently frustrated. This ap
pears to be, after a reasonably complete investigation,
the only half-way justification that may be made of that
man-killing sport known as deer hunting.
SOME one has told the story of Laurence Grou
lund, author of "The Co-operative Republic." and
another has told the story of Maximoff, the Rus
sian nobleman who became a disciple of Tolstoy. They
arc warp and woof of the same fabric. Gronlund, elab
orately educated and trained professionally, had no
grit^in his make-up and was a complete failure. Not
looking within for the reason, he put the blame on
society and proceeded, in his book, to invent a social
state in which he would have a place in company with
all the gritless, the do-less and the feckless".
Gronlund was a cultured and amiable character, but
I^e had not practical sense enough to clothe himself
and failed as steward "of his wife's estate. It was a
surprise 'to his friends that he had life enough to die.
Maximoff was of the same sort. He concluded to leave
the feet of Tolstoy and come to the United States and
live with and redeem the masses. Finding no business
opening and having no handicraft, he, who had been
an army officer and a good one, opened a fruit stall
in New York City to re'deem the people of the slums.
But the people of the slums stole his fruit while he
dreamed of their elevation and he was put out of busi
ness. Then he went on his great mission by opening
a candy stand at the door of a theater, where no one
bought candy, and another failure followed. Then he
returned to his profession of arms and went to help
the Boers. His bones bleach on the South African veldt
'He was a feckless philosopher. It is written, and
cannot be canceled, that the only help that may be
wisely extended to man is to help him to help himself.
If he will not help himself, let him alone. There is no
grit in his fiber. Gronlund and Maximoff leave no
message inspiring man to self-help. That can be done
only by men who can help themselves, and they could
not. .'^V

Two of the concessions operating at the St. Louis Ex

is wondering at another manifestation of the inexpli

this is not the road to bankruptcy.

which French social leaders begin a
hunt:
Before the Chase.
In reviewing this first of my so
journs in Russia, my thoughts na
turally dwell upon the two sover
eigns â Nicholas I and Alexander IL
The first of these was a great man
scared out of greatness by the ever
recurring specter of the French Revo
lution. There had been much to make
him a stern reactionary. He could
not but remember that two Czars, his
father and grandfather, had both been
murdered in obedience to family ne
cessities. At his proclamation as Em
peror he had been welcomed by a re
volt which had forced him
To wade through slaughter to a thron* â
A revolt which had deluged the great
parade ground of St. Petersburg with
the blood of his best soldiers, which
had sent many of the nobUlty to Si
beria, and which had obliged him to
see the bodies of several men who
might have made his reign Illustrious
dangling from the fortress walls op
posite the Winter Palace. He had been
obliged to grapple with a fearful In
surrection in Poland, caused partly by
the brutality of his satraps, but mainly
by religious hatreds, to - suppress -it
with enormous carnage, and to sub
stitute a cruel despotism for the mod
erate constitutional liberty which his
brother had granted. He had thus be
come the fanatical apostle of reaction
throughout Europe, and as such was
everywhere the implacable enemy of
any evolution of liberty. The despots
of Europe adored him. As symbols
of his ideals he had given to the King
of Prussia and to the Neapolitan
Bourbon copies of two of the statues
which adorned his Nevsky bridge â
statues representing restive horses re
strained by strong men; and the Ber
lin populace, with unerring instinct,
had given to one of these the name of
"Progress Checked" and to the other
the name "Retrogression Encour
aged." To this day one sees every
where In the palaces of Continental
rulers, whether great or petty, his
columns of Siberian porphyry, bowls
of jasper or vases of malachite â signs
cf his approval of reaction. But, In
justice to him, it should be sal# that
there was one crime he did not com
mit â a crime. Indeed, which he did not
dare commit: He did not violate his
oath to maintain the liberties of Fin
land. That was reserved for the sec
ond Nicholas, now on the Russian
throne.
Whether at the great assemblages of
the Winter Palace, or at the reviews,
or simply driving in hte sledge, or
walking in the street, he overawed all
men by his presence; whenever I
saw him, and never more cogently
than' during that last drive of his just
before his death, there was forced to my
lips the thought, "You are the most
majestic being ever created." Colossal
in stature, with a face such as one
finds on a Greek coin, but overcast
with a shadow of Muscovite melan
choly, with a bearing dignified, but
with a manner not unkind, he bore
himself like a god. And yet no man
could be more simple or affable,
whether in his palace or In the street.
Those were. the days when a Russian
Czar could drive or/walk alone in every
part of every city in hia empire. He
frequently took his exercise in walking
along the Neva quay, and enjoyed
talking with any friends he met. espe
cially with members of the diplomatic
corps. â From Andrew D. White's

By way of contrast with the all pervading terror of
Eastern heat from which there was no escape the record
of California at the same dates may be used. In the dry
valleys and foothills the temperature ran to ioo. but
there was no suffering and no cessation of work. In
Livcrmore Valley, forty miles from San Francisco, the
temperature was ioo, but in this city it was cool at 62. By
an hour's journey anybody that did not like the heat of
Livermore could come to the cool coast. It is safe to
say, however, that more people went from San Fran
cisco to Livcrmore to enjoy the dry heat than came here
to escape it
The universal humidity of the East is the afflicting
clement in great heat or cold. It is the humidity that
spreads the heat like a blaze of fire over an area of
thousands of miles and that maintains a deathly high
temperature all-night. Here where it is hot it is per
fectly dry so that when night falls the temperature falls
and there is hardly a night in California that is too warm
for refreshing sleep.
THE cold Eastern spring is followed by a summer of
unusual heat. From the Atlantic seaboard to the
great lakes the heat covers the whole country like
a universal blister. The coast citiesâ New York, Boston,
Philadelphia and Baltimoreâ were suffering in a common
swelter, and the awful heat was so pervasive that there
was no escaping it. Old age and infancy were the great
est sufferers, and the deaths at the two extremes of life
told the story of the cruelty of climate to the helpless.
In Chicago thousands of people finding no relief on the
lake front nor in the parks resorted to the electric cars
which run under the river by tunnels, and these were
crowded by the panting throng that rode back and forth
in the cold tunnels till the heat of the day passed. In
such a climate there should be two story cities, one
above ground to be used when the weather permits and
the other below ground for use in the hot summer and
cold winter. .
A WEATHER CONTRAST.
Caspar Whitney, the editor of Out
ing, who Is now making an extended
trip of mingled pleasure and business
in the Far East, supplies his magazine
with a clear-cut picture of Bangkok,
capital of Siam. He writes:
"It is a strange, half floating city,
this Bangkok, overrun with pariah
doers and crows; Oriental despite its
improvements, and one of the most in
teresting cities in the Far East. Yet
a tad city for the visitor with mind
apart from margins and money-saving
machinery. At every turning are evi
dences of decay of native art, and in
their stead the hideously common
place things that bear the legend
'made in Germany. 1 One would
scarcely believe to-day, after a visit
to Bangkok, that at one time the
Siamese were distinguished. even
among Asiatic artisans, in Bilk weav
ing, in ceramics, in ivory carving and
in silversmithing. Yet the royal mu
seum discloses treasures not found
elsewhere in the world, which serve
to remind how far Siam has fallen
from the place she once occupied
among the art producing nations of
the world. When therefore we be
hold a people discouraging and losing
their splendid ancient arts and giving
instead a ready market to the cheap
trash that comes out of the West, we
may hardly look for native industrial
development. The day is probably not
far off when Slam's industries will de
pend upon foreign guidance; and if
England, not France, supplies that im
petus^ â the world will be the gainer.
"By those travelers who delight In
comparisonsâ and read travelers' fold
ers especially compiled for tourist con
sumptionâBangkok has been variously
called the Constantinople of Asia and
the Venice of the East. True, there is
much pertinence in both comparisons.
Certainly Bangkok is the home of the
gaunt and ugly pariah dog, which
spends its days foraging to keep life
in its mangy carcass, multiplying
meanwhile with the fecundity of cats
in a tropical clime, because the Buddha
faith forbids its killing. Nor are out
cast dogs the only pests of Bangkok,
to grow numerous because of native re
ligious prejudice; more noisy crows
perch of an early morning on your win
dow casing and the tree Immediately
beyond it than in the space of a day
hover near the 'Towers of Silence* at
Bombay awaiting the pleasure of the
vultures feeding on the earthly remains
of one that has died in the faith of the
Parsee.
"Some people fancy Bangkok a city
of islands; hence I suppose the com
parison with Venice. Bangkok has, in
deed, a very large floating population,
and the city is intersected with many
'klawngs' (canals); at certain times of
the year, too, perhaps half the city and
the surrounding country is under a foot
or mere of tide water. Yet the largest
half of Bangkok's 400,000 citizens llvea
on land, though the easiest means of
travel throughout much of the city is
by boat, 'and, in fact, half of it is
reached In no other way. The Siamese
woman of the lower class daily paddles
her own canoe to the market; or, if in
the better class, she goes in a 'rua
chang,' the common passenger boat,
which, together with the Jinriklsha, the
land passenger carrier throughout the
Orient, Is included among the house

can afford it." v-Y

Mrs. Sidney Webb's declaration at
tbe Women Writers' dinner that she
cared little for novels and "positively
hated" poetry affords striking evident
of the mental limitations cf an excep
tionally gifted woman. Before her
man-lace she was well known as Miss
Beatrice Potter and -enjoyed the dis
tinction of being one of the few women
whom Herbert Spencer, as he relates
in his autobiography, greatly esteemed
on account of -her intellectual attain
ments. The great philosopher regarded
her as one of Ms chosen disciples and
It was a source of disappointment to
fcfTn when sue became an ardent social-
George Meredith's now almost con-
Etant companion is Edward Clodd, who
like Mr. Stedrr.an and Kenneth Gra
hame, is both banker and author his
vrcrks being chiefly on philosophical
questions.
In referring to America, Mr. Mere
dith calls her "the shrewdest leader of
men," and adds, "the Americans have
cowered the world with priceless in
ventiena. promise of the great things
to be expected of them. And they are
humane, a large-hearted people; but
they are a very young people still and,
hitherto, perhaps the country has been
rather too large for them."
"Critics used to lay about them with
a will. To be sure It was rather a
broadsword and bludgeon style. But
now, I think, criticism is becoming al
most too urbane. It Is true the general
level of literature has immensely im
proved. In my youth we had a few
great names â Dickens, Thackeray and
George Eliot. I think you have noth
ing to compare with them now In the
front rank. But in the rank close be
hind the front your attainment Is cer
tainly much higher than anything we
then possessed."
Much of what Mr. Meredith says will
be resented in this country. For in
stance, his declaration that fear of
death is the real cause of the English
objection to conscription. "Men come
to me." he says, "and say their trade
â¢would suffer or they could not spare
two years of their apprenticeship. Their
real meaning is thÂ«t they are afraid
of being called out and getting shot
at. So they pay others to do the killing
and dying for them."
Meredith's own creed with regard to
the fear of death Is characteristic "No
one," he says, "should consider death
or think cf it as worse than going
from one room into another. Every
night when I go to bed I know I may
not rise from It. That Is nothing to
me. I hope I shall die with a good
laugh, like the old French woman. The
cure came walling to her about her
BSJvation and things like that and -she
told him her best improper story and
died. The Gcd of Nature and human
nature does not dislike humor, you
may be sure, and would rather he"ar it
in extremity than the formless official
drone. Let us believe in a hearty God
â one to love more than to fear."
HEADQUARTERS OF THE CALL.
E HENRIETTA STREET. COVENT
GARDEN, LONDON, July 10. â It Is
quite impossible to write about liter
ary happenings here without referring:
to the striking Interview with George
Meredith, which has Just appeared in
the London Chronicle. During many
years of invalMism the mind of the
gTettest living writer of English has
maintained its brilliancy and its'
possessor kept closely in touch with
current events, but it was feared by
his admirers that Mr. Meredith's re
cent serious illness might have proved
too much for even his amazing mental
vitality. The recluse of Box Hill is
now 76. No one, however, needs to do
more than read this interview with
George Meredith to be assured that all
is well with the mind that produced
"Richard Feveral." Evidently, how
ever, "the master," as he Is called
reverently here, will write no more, as
he says that since this last illness he
has felt "a peculiar disinclination for
â¢work of all kinds." and adds that the
thought of taking tip a pen is "quite
abhorrent." But Mr. Meredith says
that though his mind "now seÂ»ms as
if It could not give out any more," he
is as receptive as ever. And there is
no doubt about that. He must read his
morning paper with avidity, for we
Cnd him perfectly informed upon every
topic which the world, and particularly
this cG-untry, is discussing to-day. The
war in the East, the subject of women's
rights, the political situation in Eng
land, the question about conscription,
the tendency of modern journalism â
with all of these topics he is absolutely
familiar, and he is equally incisive in
dealing with each one of them. But
probably it is what Mr. Meredith had
to say regarding literary matters that
will be read with most interest in the
United States.
In modern book reviewing he finds
what he terms "an almost excessive
urbanity of treatment." "It seems as
if critics were afraid to blame any
thing," he says. "This is particularly
evident in reviews of poetry which have
been frequent of late. Our Laureate
is wrong in supposing people will not
read poetry now. It seems that they
were never so anxious to read it. They
are continually on the lookout for it,
and they appear to be receiving a fair
quantity, which is nearly always
praised.

"1 shall never forget my first case
when I began the practice of law many
years ago," said one of our Superior
Judges In reminiscent mood recently.
"I had undertaken to defend a man
who was accused of murder mainly
on circumstantial evidence, and the
popular sentiment â¢was decidedly
against my client. This sentiment was
evidently shared In by the Judge be
fore whom the case was tried. The
latter appeared only to realize that a
murder had been committed and that
some one should suffer for the crime,
whether guilty or Innocent.
"The Judge overruled my objections
at every turn and thoroughly convinced
me that he did not intend to icive my
client a fair trial. I bore his tactics
for some time in silence, but when he !
overruled my objection on a certain
point which even my opposing counsel
appeared surprised at patience ceased
to be a virtue. I did not dare to com
mit any overt act in the court, as tha
Judge had several times threatened to
punish me for contempt. I therefore
contented myself with gathering up my
papers to put them In order and sat
down.
" 'Confound it, sir/ said the Judge,
â¢how dare you show your contempt for
this court?"
Contempt Concealed.
THE Red Sea is a high sea, in the sense of being wa
ter under no municipal jurisdiction. Russia, with
that sinister deception that is her most prominent
characteristic, smuggled two auxiliary warships out of
the Black Sea and through the Dardanelles and is using
them to patrol the Red Sea and to seize and search ves
sels that are under neutral flags. It is the testimony of
European passengers on the seized ships that the Rus
sian officers conducted themselves with conspicuous bru
tality, but'that has also come to be expected of Russian
officers, who have before them the example of the royal
and indecent Boris. In these seizures the mail sacks
have been gutted in search of Japanese official mail and
ammunition belonging to Great Britain, en route
to Hongkong, has been taken.
In the eye of international law much of this Russian
conduct borders closely on piracy. During war one be
iigerent may not take an officer of the other from the deck
of a neutral ship on deep water. Nor may such officer
be searched under a neutral flag. A bearer of dispatches
between Japanese Ministers at London, Paris or Berlin
cannot lawfully be seized on the deck of a neutral ship
and his dispatch box rifled. A neutral flaf protects both.
This being the case with the officer of a^belligcrent, by
parity of reasoning mails are not contraband, but pre
serve on the high seas the same inviolable "character that
they have on land. All ocean mail steamers have con
tracts with the governments for which they carry mail.
The presence of the mail on them is not merely an inci
dent in the functions of a common carrier. The ship
represents an official contract to which- a government,
and maybe more than one government, is a party.
When the fulfillment of that contract to promptly and
safely transport the mail to its destination is interfered
with by forcible seizure on the high seas the government,
as a contracting party, has been struck in the face and
insulted in its sovereignty by an act of piracy.
The United States seldom uses the Suez canal and our
flag is strange in the Red Sea. But it is common in the
Pacific. The Pacific Mail steamer Korea is under the
American flag. She carries mail, under contract, be
tween San Francisco and Yokohama. .She and her sister
ships ' carry the officials and the official mail back and
forth between San Francisco and Yokohama. The Rus
sian Foreign Office has been ordering and justifying the
seizure of British ships in the Red Sea. When reminded
that the route may be changed to the Cape of Good
Hope Russia announces that she will post a fleet off that
British colony and continue there to seize British ships
and rifle their mails. Thcfe is no more important. official
Japanese mail than that between Washington and Tokio,
carried across the Pacific under the American flag and by
contract. with this Government.
If Great Britain assent to the rifling of her mail and
the bullying of her flag the effect will be to drive the
Asiatic mail to a new route across the United States and
over the Pacific under our flag. Perhaps Russia would
like to try seizing a few sacks of it and making a prize
of the steamer that carries it as she has of the British
steamer Malacca.
The defense of Russia's action published at St. Peters
burg in the Russ declares that she will continue to seize
all contraband of war under neutral flags on the high
seas regardless of its consignment and destination. That
declaration amounts to an embargo upon the trade of
the world. Admitting that contraband, consigned to Ja
pan, is subject to seizure, there is no warrant in interna
tional law for the detention of a ship with contraband on
board consigned to a neutral port.
Take our own case. We are continually sending, un
der our flag, contraband of war to Manila. Great Britain
was sending contraband on the Malacca under exactly
the same circumstances to her colony at Hongkong.
Russia claims the right of seizure because it is contra
band and regardless of the ownership or destination.
Perhaps Russia would like to try seizing an American
transport loaded with contraband for Manila. We would
like to see her try it. There would follow sdmething
that would edify and instruct the world. Great Britain
and Germany may choose to submit to that form of pi
racy and let it pass off with diplomatic palaver. Bat the
American people are impressed that their flag means
something. It is seldom seen in the Red Sea, but is not
difficult to find in some other waters. It protects what it
flies over and it is the flag of the Pacific. If Russia has
not found this out she can do so by transferring to the
Pacific her Red Sea ideas of international law.
Relations between authors and pub
lishers being so frequently strained in
these days, it is worth noting that the
late Sir H. M. Stanley named Mr. Mar

Stanley made a lot of money out of the

discriminatory are shown to be inap

from the State board. The matter
was carried to the Supreme Court on

rested for practicing dentistry without
a license. ; '
The court holds that while the law
gives the Board of Dental Examiners
great power, the Legislature has the
right to impose such restrictions as it
may choose when the public welfare
and health is involved. Dentists who
were practicing prior to the passage
of the act and those who are grad

standing rosy secure licenses under the
law at the will of the board.

of half-nude bathers on the beach
were offensive and scandalous. One
of the committee said that the bathers
seemed to take a pride in displaying
their shapely anatomies for the de
lectation of their admiring friends.
They asked the board to place a po
liceman on the beach to prevent this.
W. L. Harper, who had already
asked the Commissioners for permis
sion to erect bathing-houses on the
beach, then requested that the Com
missioners themselves erect bath
houses. Commissioner Lloyd replied
that the Commissioners had asked for
funds with which to do this, but had
failed to obtain an appropriation.
Complaint was also made that de
spite the noticeof the Commissioners,
automobiles stillcontinued to "scorch"
along the ocean boulevard. The im
provement club was told that if it
would hire and pay for a special man
the Commissioners would procure him
a permit to arrest such offenders.
They also said the official would be
empowered to arrest any semi-clad
bathers along the beach. The club
made the following requests: That an
entrance to the park at Forty-seventh
avenue be constructed; that more
lights be placed along the boulevard,
and that picnic parties be prevented
from littering the sand dunes and
beach with papers and refuse. These
requests were taken under advisement.
The Point Lobos Improvement Club
asked that Mountain Lake Park in the
Richmond district be improved and
that the destruction of birds be
stopped. This, together with the re
peated killing of quail in Golden Gate
Park, led to a vote that notices be
posted in all the parks offering a re
ward of $50 for the arrest and convic
tion of any person trapping, maiming
or killing any bird or animal in any of
the parks.
Petition was made that the appro
priation of $5000 for the improvement
of Dolores street, from Fifteenth to
Sixteenth, be used by the Park Com
missioners. This appropriation was
made "by the Supervisors, but the
money was tied up. The residents pe
tition the Commissioners to take
charge so that the work, which has for
it3 object the beautification of the Mis
sion Dolores neighborhood, may be
completed. The commission will call
for plans for the work.
The peddlers are still seeking to
gain admission to the beach. They
claim that the Park Commissioners
have no jurisdiction over the strip of
sand between the boulevard and the
ocean. William R. Hewitt, Chief of
the Department of Electricity, who
was the original surveyor, testified that
his survey made no dividing line be
tween the highway and the ocean.
Judge Mpgan has the case under ad
visement. 1
"In examinations for promotion in the
Police Department, beginning with
those held this month, the commission
will not hereafter require applicants to
pass a medical examination. This deci
sion was reached as a result of the in
effectiveness of condemnations made by
our medical boards in past examina
tions for promotions. In several in
stances applicants barred by the doc
tors when they came up for promotion
were, retained in active service in the
department, notwithstanding the phy
sical disabilities from which they were
suffering. There were two reasons for
their retentionâ first, the Police Com
missioners needed them, as they could
not afford to diminish the working
force of the department unles the dis
missal or pensioning of the men became
imperative; second, the pension fund
was not strong enough to bear the
added burden of the retirement of ad
ditional men. The anomalous condition
thus arose of the retention in active
service of men condemned by the med
ical board as unfit for active duty in a
higher rank.
"We therefore decided to leave the
question of the physical ability of the
applicants for promotion in the hands
of the Police Commissioners. They
have the right to retire a member of
the department whenever he becomes
disabled, and in our opinion they should
have the opportunity to exercise that
r^ght without our assistance.
"We have also limited the period
during which meritorious conduct will
be considered in examinations for pro
motion in the Police Department to
January 8, 1300, when the charter went
into effect.
"We recommend to your Honor the
advisability of introducing ln the Police
Department some satisfactory method
of recorcng meritorious servfee, so that
in subsequent examinations for promo
tion better consideration may be given
to applicants who by their conduct
have shown themselves worthy of pro
motion."
The Civil Service Commission yester
day filed its annual report with the
Mayor, showing that during the last
fiscal year six examinations have been
held for various positions in the Fire.
Health and Police departments. The
report also shows that 3853 applicants
passed in a total of ninety-six examina
tions held since January 8, 1900, and
2054 failed. There were 1125 appoint
ments made, including 150 temporary
clerks. There are 3023 laborers regis
tered, of whom seventy-two are work
ing. The report also tells of the litiga
tion in which the department has been
involved and of its troubles with other
departments, which, however, have all
been settled. The report continues:
It was then decided to send a com
munication to the Modesto and Tur
lock Irrigation District boards, who
are opposing this city's petition for
water rights on the Tuolumne, asking
them to meet in conference with the
representatives of the bay cities for the
purpose of securing harmonious action
in the matter.
Braunhart explained that the appli
cation of this city for water rights on
the Tuolumne River had been denied
by the Secretary of the Interior, that
Congress had been memorialized to
grant the rights, that, steps must be
taken to procure a municipal supply
and that a great deal depends upon the
activity of nearby cities. Price was of
the opinion that the Spring Valley
Water Company's plant was inade
quate to supply water to the whole
coast line around the bay and the cities
would have to look further.
Dockweiler urged that energy should
be first spent in getting water rights
before a dollar is expended. On a
basis of 60,000,000 gallons the scheme
would cost $40,000,000 and even if the
Spring Valley plant was taken over it
would be necessary to go to the Sierra
Nevada watersheds for more water,
said Dockweiler. He strongly favored
the Tuolumne project, which Waggon
er contended was not the only avail
able source. Braunhart thought the
Spring Valley Water Works should be
acquired as an auxiliary system to
prevent the tearing up of streets to
install new mains.
The members of the Supervisors'
Public Utilities Committee held a con
ference yesterday with representatives
of Alameda, Berkeley and Oakland for
the purpose' of agreeing upon joint ac
tion in 'the matter of securing a muni
cipal water supply for this city and its
neighbors across the bay. Besides Su
pervisors Braunhart, D'Ancona, Mc
(Jlellan, Bi/xton, Booth, Hocks and
Connor, there were present Joseph
Forderer of Alameda, who was called
to the chair, Thomas Rickard and
Thomas Dowd of Berkeley, A. H. El
liott, G. E. Aitken and J. T. Wallace
of Oakland, City Engineer Woodward
and Engineers H. Price, J. H. Dock
weiler and Luther Waggoner.

a most bitter contest was waged
against us by the members of the
Harders-Berger committee and their
few followers.
"We are inclined to the belief that
the Harders-vBerger committee has
very little standing as a county com
mittee or with the voters of the Union
Labor party. We are forced to the be
lief that at the last municipal election
.the members and followers of the
Harders-Berger committee were with
the enemy. At the same time it is
the desire of this committee for har

Labor party, and while we reject the
suggestions made by the Harders-
Berger committee, we extend the hand
of good fellowship to them and ask
them to join with us, the regular gov

In its petition for the writ the Hiber
nia Bank set forth that Mrs. Florencia
Portener, daughter of Attorney Spli
\ alo, borrowed $10,000 from the bank in
1S8T, giving a mortgage on the property
as security. During the foreclosure pro
ceedings it developed that Mrs. Spll
valo, wife of the attorney, claimed title
to the property and repudiated the
debt of her daughter. But the bank

soon as the writ of assistance was is-
Eucd it .was placed in the hands of
Sheriff r Cui Us and his deputies were
djrected to execute it.

PETITION* OF BANK.
The complaint goes on to say that
the house was .raided and ransacked
and some of Its contents were des
stroyed. The Sheriff and his assistants
began by pitching out all the valuable
furniture, jewelry and rare books, It Is
alleged, and they continued the "raid,
wreckage and devastation" from 4:30
in the afternoon of January 25 until 9
o'clock the next morning. It is also
said that the men did their work in a
"riotous and tumultuous manner" and
that, under the leadership of the Sher
iff, they were "vulgar, unmannerly and
Ignorant" and did not appreciate the
worth of the property they were so
roughly handling.
For the "oppression, violence and
abuse" the plaintiff demands $10,000
exemplary damages and for the in
juries and destruction of property she
asks payment In the sum of $15,000. J.
A. Spinettl is her attorney.
Yesterday's suit is the culmination of
an effort of the Hibernia Bank to gain
possession of the home where Augus
tus D. Splivalo, a well-known attor
ney,' lived and entertained distin
guished guests for many years. The
ejectment of the Splivalos from their
home, the basis of the suit filed yester
day, was made by the Sheriff's depu
ties under a writ of assistance issued
by Judge Hebbard.
She alleges that on January 25, 1904,
the Sheriff broke into the Splivalo
home at 1120 Washington street, over
powered her aged^xnother and minor
son and took forcible possession of the
house. The complainant avers that the
residence contains twenty-flve rooms
which were nicely fitted w:'.h rare fur
niture, carpets and paintings worth
$20,000. The value of the Jewelry, sil
verware and relics, together with the
library in the building at that time is
placed at $25,000, the garden and con
servatory at $1000 and the dwelling and
outhouses at $50,000.

FOR BIG SUM
Sheriff's deputies proceeded with their
work. Furniture and valuables and
carpets and kitchen utensils were piled
together on the sidewalk. "When the
work was done the Hibernia Bank was
in possession. Yesterday's suit does not
complain that the Sheriff or his depu
ties acted illegally in removing the fur
niture, but that in its removal they
exercised undue strenuousity.
This allegation Sheriff Curtis denies.
He said last evening that he had long
expected the suit, as the Splivalos had
given him much trouble In his official
efforts to carry out the orders of the
court. He said his deputies had in
jured nothing, nor was Mrs. Spltvalo
damaged through their actions. Ha
simply did his official duty as ha found
it, he said, and was not afraid of the
outcome.

pont and Clay streets.. The collision
occurred as the ambulance was dash

severely cut about the head and neck.
The driver of the ambulance received

Another beautiful porcelain is a vase
of Imari ware, made in Hizen province
in 1596. The exceptional point about the
vase is the decoration. While the
archaic pattern is principally followed,
two different methods are employed.
The design is alike on each side. At the
base, on a Jet black background. Is
shown a Chinese lion, or karashishi, in
a crouching attitude guarding a double
crest. The whole is framed with a
white . border of blue. Immediately
above, over the glaze, is depicted the
imperial ho-ho bird, or royal pheasant,
surrounded by sprays of the wonderful
kiri tree. Altogether the vase is an in
tensely interesting piece of the old sym
bolic pottery. â
The most highly prized part of the
collection is made up of several gorge
ous screens of very ancient workman
ship. Each has six folding panels,
which bear wonderful paintings from
the hands of old Japanese masters. Al
though these ancient masterpieces show
Some difficulty was encountered in
getting the goods released from bond,
but this was finally accomplished and
the consignment was delivered to the
university several weeks ago. Since
then Curator Peterson, assisted by
Ikeda and Inada, has been busily en
gaged in putting the articles in place
in the museum. The entire collection
has not arrived, but will reach the uni
versity in two weeks, at which time
the Japanese room will be again closed
to permit the Installation of the new
goods.
Nearly every famous artist of Japan,
both modern and ancient, is represent
ed. Some of the most interesting pieces
are figures of Japanese mythological
characters. These are extremely odd
and many of them of great age. One of
the rarest of these is an ancient exam
ple of Kyoto ware. The legendary fox
Is depicted as an old man In long-flow
ing robes and a strange hood. He car
ries a parasol and a cane. It is the
handiwork of Nonomura Ninsei, a cele
brated artist in this ware, which was
produced about 1655 A. D.
The most notable piece of cloissone
in the whole exhibition is a huge In
cense burner, or koro, of the Chlenling
period. It is globular in shape, sup
ported by three short gold legs, with a
fret-worked cover surmounted by con
ventionalized lotus blossoms. The body
of the koro is of a dull light-blue, the
ornaments, consisting of flowers and
scrollwork designs, are worked out in
white, red, green and dark blue enam
els. On the cover appears a crest thrice
repeated. The handles are unique, in
the form of a blocked dragon, with
sides finished in burnished gold. The
whole stands on a base of similar work

A second rara avis of the exhibition
Is a vase of the world-famed "peach

and glaze of delicate pink originated by
a Chinese potter centuries ago and
since lost to the world. Only two ether
specimens of this rare and costly wars
are known to exist in the United States.
One of these was bought for $15,000,

to be sent to England as a first re
sort. Being goods upon which heavy
duties "were laid," they were put un
der bond pending their safe arrival at
their destination and thus it was that
they came to. the San Francisco Cus
tom-house. |
Ikeda, during his visit to Mrs. Stan
ford, referred to the above, found her
greatly interested in Japanese art, and,
under the warmth of her conversation,
laid before her the whole story of his
journey abroad. Mrs. Stanford looked
over his catalogue, decided at once to
make him an off er, /did so, and was
gratified by an acceptance. Exactly
how much she paid for the entire col
lection is_not known, but it is under
stood the sum was considerably more
than 5100,000. A check for the amount
was sent directly to~ the Mikado. This
is the simple story of how a rich
American, -widow ultimately con
tributed to the Japanese war fund
and probably despoiled a European
RIVAL. IMPERIAL. TREASURES.
Some of these valuable fancies were
family relics that had been handed
down from ancient generations, others
were odd old images from China and
there were pieces of historic paintings
of almost priceless worth. It was said
by those who knew Ikeda's collection
that it rivaled some of the Imperial
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, July 23.
A large exhibition room in the Stan
ford University Museum will be open
ed for the first time next Monday
morning to display a superb collection
of Japanese art treasures recently pur
chased at enormous expense by Mrs.
Stanford and quietly installed before
any of the -transactions In connection
with the purchase were made public.
The facts were given out to-day and
proved of remarkable interest.
S. Ikeda Jr. and H. Iuada, two
young noblemen of Japan, arrived In
San Francisco about two- months ago
en route from their native land to
England. The popular supposition at
the time was that they were upon
some mission pertaining to the Jap
anese-Russian war, but the purpose of
their journey was not made public.
They visited Stanford University and
called on Mrs. Stanford at her country
residence. She, had met the young
men during a trip to Japan a short
time previously and made them wel
come at her home.-
In 1903 S. Ikeda Sr., the father of
young Ikeda, died at Kyoto, Japan,
leaving a large estate. The older Ikeda
had "occupied a position for" many
years as one of the foremost art con
noisseurs of Japan. At Kyoto he
owned extensive potteries and In some
of the larger citifes such as Tokio he
maintained noted art and curio stores.
He was famed as a collector through
out the Orient and made annual tours
into China and Asia to add new'ma
terial to his rich treasures. The
choicest bits of pottery and other ma
terials that Ikeda secured on these
visits he invariably retained for his
own personal collection, which he
kept in his magnificent Japanese resi
dence at Kyoto. There he had amassed
a rare gxpup of beautiful closonne,
satsuma and agano wares, handsome
lacquers, rich bronzes, carved ivories
and many other articles of curious and
beautiful Interest. His home was a
veritable treasure-house of the richest
products of Oriental handicraft.
Jacob Eppinger is still in the custody
ef the Sheriff and still enjoying the un
usual privilege of being held prisoner
In the chambers of a Judge of the Su
perior Court instead of In the County
Jail, as is the fate Qf others In his
predicament.
-From the time he was remand
ed to the custody of the Sheriff he has
occupied the chambers of Judge Car
roll Cook, now absent on his vacation.
He has also been permitted to choose
his own dining-room, and accompanied
by a Sheriff's deputy has taken his
meals outside the walls of the Hall of
Justice.
The corridors of the hall were
thronged all day yesterday and until
late last night .with friends of the de
fendant, his attorneys and others in
terested in the case. Speculation was
rife but facts there were none. The
jurors were closely guarded during
their deliberations, one deputy taking
a seat at the doorway leading from
the jury-room to the courtroom and
another being stationed at the door
openiife into the corridor. The corri
dor was kept clear of all but officers of
the court and attaches of the Sheriff's
office.
Early in the afternoon It was rumor
ed that the Jury stood eight for con
viction and four for acquittal and later
it was said that but one man was hold
ing out for acquittal, the other eleven
being satisfied as to the guilt of the
defendant.
In his improvised prison Jacob Ep
pinger, surrounded by r family and
friends,' Is anxiously awaiting the ver
dict. He slept but little Friday night
and during the day would alternately
sit in gloomy silence and pace nervous
ly up and down the room. The en
forced confinement even In the lux
uriously furniphed chambers of Judge
Cook was Irksome and the suspense al
most unendurable' At about 10 o'clock
he had one of his spasms which from
time to time havs delayed the trial,
but it was of short duration and no
physician was called in to minister to
him.
The Jurors will resume their delib
erations this morning.
After* deliberations lasting many
hours the jury in the case of Jacob
Eppinger failed to agree on a verdict
last evening, and was again locked up
for the night at the Palace Hotel. The
case was submitted- to^ the Jury at 5
o'clock Friday afternoon and ample
time has elapsed to admit of a fore
man being chosen and scores of ballots
taken, but not a word has been heard
from the talesmen. . ' , Â¦

BROWNS LAND ON ST. VRAIN.
Portland Outslugs the Tigers and Wins
Easily.
PORTLAND, July 23.â Nearly every
body took a crack at the ball out at the
Twenty-fourth Street grounds this aft
ernoon. Of the fifteen runs i made by
both teams eleven were earned. So
fiercely did the Browns clout St. Vraln's
delivery in the very first inning that
the little man was sent out into right
field to rest up and catch his breath.
Lynch was called to the slab from cen
ter field and did fairly well, but the
Tigers found the lead too great to over
come. '.
They took active interest, however,
in the seventh and eighth innings.
I Three runs then resulted from five hits,
but not enough to win. This is how it
happened to Jimmy St. Vrain in the
beginning: Nadeau and McCreedie sin
gled, Dren nan blanked, but Beck"s hit
filled the bases. Raymond popped a fly
that sent him to the benches. With
two men out Druhot lined the ball
down to third, the sphere hit the cush
ion and flew over Sheehan's head. Two
men came in. Castro and Steelman
were there with the goods and three
more runs were scored. Jberg waved
his club at three wide ones, so the scor
ing ceased for a period. The Bcore:

LONDON, July 23.â Yale and Har
vard were the victors in the interna
tional games held to-day at the
Queen's Club, West Kensington, They
defeated Oxford and Cambridge In six
out of nine events before an immense
crowd, which never lost interest, even
in such a tedious contest as hammer
throwing. A mast was placed on one
side of the field, from which flew an
American or British flag, as the victory
went from one side to the other. It
finally floated the stars and stripes as
an official notification of the success of
the blue and crimson.
The weather suited the Americans
splendidly, being intensely warm and
the clouds covering the heavens occa
sionally letting fall a light sprinkle of
rain. C. N. Jackson, steward for Ox
ford and Cambridge, sincerely congrat
ulated the Americans. He said:
"While I anticipated the Americans
would win. 1 did not believe It would
be six to three. Our men in the high
jump and quarter were not up to prac
tice form. I do not believe we shall go
over next year, though the matter will
be considered."
The keen interest of 4he English peo
ple in the international sports between
Harvard- Yale and Oxford-Cambridge
was shown by the early hour at which
the throngs of .spectators began to ar
rive at the club grounds, West Ken
sington.

Easily.
Then the runs ceased till the fatal
ninth was at hand. Oakland had a
chance in the sixth, when Dunleavy
was on third and Schlafley on second
and one gone. Devereaux was up and
the hit and run signal was tipped. But
"Brick" did not hit and consequently
Dunleavy was run down between third
base and the home plate.
Not another chance did Oakland
have. Shields grew steadier as the
game wore on and allowed but few
hits. Schmidt pitched one of the best
games in a long time, but still lie did
not have quite enough luck with him.
Van Haltren executed one of the great
est catches ever seen on the grounds In
the first inning, when he ran away '
back to the fence and caught Dun
leavy's ... drive with one mitt. The
score:

It was a ninth inning getaway that
snatched victory from Oakland yes
terday afternoon. The Commuters had
the Slwashes going and were leading,
2 to 1, when the fatal last round be
gan. The northern hosts were there
with the clubs. .Thrice they.binged
the ball and all was over. Score â
Oakland, 2; Seattle, 3.
The rally was a nice one â as nice
a bit of walloping as has been seen
In moons. Mohler led off with a drive
over the third cushion and Williams
sacrificed. Frisk, who could not get a
hit all day, bumped the sphere right
over second and it went to the fence
for a two-bagger, bringing Mohler in
and making it a deadlock â 2 to 2.
Smith finished up . a good day's
work by driving out another double
over Dunleavy's head and breaking it
up for fair.
The game was a good, fast one and
full of real baseball. Both Shields and
Schmidt were in winging form and
tossed nice shoots. Both had good
support and the sharp fielding kept
many runs away from the pan. The
errors were few and these did not
count when they did happen.
The Commuters did all their run
getting in the second spasm, when
Schlafley was passed and Devereaux
sacrificed. Streib swung through with
a triple out to the flagpole and brought
Schlafley to the rubber. McKune had
a long fly to Van Haltren and Streib
Just beat the relay throw in.
The game then went along till the
next round, when Seattle broke into
the run column. Van Haltren started
the doings tvith a double to the right
field fence and came all the way home
when Mohler sneaked a mean one
through Devereaux.

STANDING OF THE CLUBS.
Regarding the assertion of the Mayor
that no prizefight was ever given
without the Mayor's approval of the
resolution granting the permit. Fay
says that a number of such resolutions
were not signed by ex-Mayor Phelan
durinjt his incumbency, owing to press
of r.ther business, but the exhibitions
were giv^n, nevertheless. V'hat Mayor
Schmitz may do, should the Board of
Supervisors press the point on the mat
ter, remains to be seen. Should the
Yosemite Club give its show without
his signature he might order the Chief
of Police to stop it, and this wouM
probably put a stop to the boxing gam.j
In this city.
Several of the members of the Board
of Supervisors are of the opinion that
since Mayor Schmltz has failed to ap
prove or disapprove tha resolution
granting the Yosemlte Club the August
permit for a professional boxing ex
hibit the resolution becomes a law
without his signature, according to the
express terms of the charter, and that
Mayor Schmltz's authority ceases in
the premises. The ten days allowed
the Mayor to take action expired last
night at midnight, but the resolution
had not been returned to the Board of
Supervisors by his Honor.
The provision to which reference is
made is contained In section 15 of the
charter, relating to the powers of tha
Board of Supervisors, and is as follows:
"Section 16. Every bill and every
resolution as hereinbefore provided,
which shall have passed the board and
shall have been duly authenticated,
shall be presented to the Mayor for his
approval. The Mayor shall return such
bill or resolution to the board within
ten days after receiving It. If he ap
prove it he shall sign it and It shall
then become an ordinance. If he dis
approve it he shall specify his objec
tions thereto In writng. If he does not
return It with such disapproval within
the time above specified it shall take
effect as If he had approved it."
Charles W. Fay, clerk of the Board
of Supervisors, stated last night that
the fact that the Mayor had taken no
action one way or the other would re
sult In the ordering of the printing of
the resolution In the official paper at
next Monday's meeting of the board,
with the addendum that the resolution
has become a law without the Mayor's
signature, according to the charter pro
vision.

served to keep the spectators in good
humor. Five o'clock was the hour set
for the men to enter -the ring, but it
was 5:06 before Fltzsimmons, accom
panied by Billy Lester. Benny Murphy,
Joe Edmonston and Charley Savld^e,
his seconds, made his appearance.
Seven minutes later O'Brien came on.
He was looked after by Lew Bailey,
Joe Hagan, Billy McCarney and Billy
Reynolds. A long wrangle ensued over
the kind of bandages worn by Fltr
simmons. Underneath the strips of
muslin were, O'Brien claimed, plaster
bandages. O'Brien said the bandages
must come off or there would be no
fight. Fitzsimmons replied: "Then
there will be no fight."
After keeping the spectators waiting
for ten minutes. Fltzsimmons removed
the plaster. Each man selected his
own' gloves and at 5:23 they were
called to the center of the ring by the
referee and given their instructions. At
5:20 the gong sounded and the battle
was on.
O'Brien began with dazzling foot
work, darting in and out with wonder
ful cleverness, landing lefts and an oc
casional right, while Fltzsimmons was
content to block, evidently endeavoring
to land on O'Brien's wind. This op
portunity came near the close of the
second round, when he drove his right
to O'Brien's body with terrific force.
The first three rounds were in O'Brien's
favor, but after that he grew a trifle
slow from the awful pace that he had
set and Fitzsimmons was able to get
in some hard blows on the body. Both
men were covered with blood when
they went to their corners at the close
of the fifth. O'Brien bleeding from a
gash over the left eye and Fitzsimmons
from the mouth and nose. Both men
were in distress when the sixth round
closed, but Fltzsimmons was apparent
ly in better condition.
Round one â Fitzsimmons led with
his left, but missed and as O'Brien,
ducked he landed a right on the back
of the neck. O'Brien landed a light
left on Fitzsimmons' face- and the men
clinched. Fitzsimmons landed a light
right on O'Brien's wind and the lat
ter drew blood from Fltzsimmons*
mouth. Jack again landed a left to
Fitzsimmc-ns* nose and got away with
out a return. O'Brien then knocked
the skin off Fltzsimmons' nose with a
light uppercut and drew the blood in
a stream from his mouth. Fltzsimmons
missed a ferocious right and Jack in
attempting to get awa: fell to the
floor. O'Brien had all the best of the
round.
Later the fight promoters went Into
the Common Pleas Court and satisfied
the Judges that it was to be a boxing
match and within the scope of the law.
Under this agreement, a permit was
granted for the bout. There were many
rumors that the men had an under
standing not to exert themselves, but
such rumors were dissipated before the
close of the first round.
There was a liberal sprinkling of
women in the grandstand, and sitting
close to the ringside was Mrs. Fltz
simmons, who, for the first time, was
to witness her husband fight. She
never took her eyes oft Fitz during the
six rounds and when he sat down at
the close of the fight.^his wife rushed
over to his corner, climbed the steps
leading to the ring and planted a kiss
on the badly swollen lips of her hus
band.
MANY WOMEN PRESENT.
PHILADELPHIA. July 23.â Jack
O'Brien and Bob Fltzsimmons to-day
fought the fastest six round bout ever
witnessed in" this city between men of
their weight. When the gong an
nounced the close of the fight both men
were on their feet, but both bore the
marks of the gruelling which they had
just gone through. Fitzsimmons' lips
were twice their normal size and his
left eye was almost closed, while
O'Brien's left eye was also cut and
swollen.
While O'Brien landed the greater
number of blows, they did not da near
ly so much damage as those landed by
Filzsimmons and the latter was the
fresher of the two at the close of the
fight. There was not a clean knock
down during the bout, but three times
O'Brien went to the floor, twice In en
deavoring to- zet away from Fitzsim
mons and "the third time partly from
Fltzsimmons' right, which landed on
Jack's neck, and partly through the
latter's feet getting tangled.
The fight was held on the National
League baseball grounds, the ring be
ing pitched Immediately over the home
plate. It was the first openair boxing
exhibition ever given in this city and
the novelty of the affair drew a crowd
of abc-ut 6000 persons. Mayor Weaver
had prevented the first meeting of the
men.
Hereafter Eddie Hanlon xnav be
classed aa a hero and life caver, for he
made his way Into that class yester
day, when he dived under a yacht
that was anchored In the bay back of
his sjyxnnaslmn and rescued Fred Lan
ders, cno ef his sparring mates, from a
watery receiving vault. Landers, who
has been looked upon as a crack swim
mer at Croirs Gardens, attempted to
<Io the TToTinir* feat of diving: under the
boat at one side and coming up on
the opposite. In some unaccountable
way he stuck to the keel of the yacht
and when hÂ© did not show up where he
was expected to appear, Toby Irwln
yelled to Hanlon, who was swimming
nearby. Without any Bldestepplng Ed
die reached the craft and dove and
Â¦who he came up he had the exhausted
Landers by the right leg and towed
him to the beach. Fred was about all
In. He was rolled on the Bands by Ir
wln and Hanlon and soon revived.
Landers said It was the first time that
he had been knocked out by water.
Eddie's work yesterday consisted of a
trip on the road In the morning in com
pany with Ted "Wolfe and Irwln. In
the afternoon the little fighter went
through his usual gymnasium stunts
and boxed four rounds with Irwln and
Landers.
Battling Nelson is a glutton for work
and wanted to go through his usual
gym stunts yesterday, but Trainer
Murphy thought It best to take things
easy, as the weather was warm.
Commencing Monday evening Nelson
will do his boxing In the evening by
electric light.

A. Drake's 3-year-old colt Ort Wells
:esurr.trd his place as the best of the
3-year-o!ds now before the public by
.vir.nins to-day the $10,000 Brighton
Derby at a mile and a half, run in
2:C2 3-5, and defeating S. S. Brown's
Broomstick. P. J. Dv.yors' Knight Er
rant and Dobadii, his stable com-
I>auion. While Broomstick finished sec
ond, the stewards did not permit him
lo retain that pÂ°Â£Â«tion. as they prompt
ly disqualified him because T. Burns,
his jockey, had fouled Ort Wells on the
turn into the home stretch the first
time around and further aggravated
it by jostling the other contender,
Knigrht Errant.
Barns' riding throughout this race
vras vigorously characterized by hun
dreds of experts as thoroughly reck
less and the stewards evidently
thought the same thing, for he was
suspended for six days. Both Knight
Krrant and Bobadil pulled up lame.
It was thought that Knight Errant
may have been injured when he was
jostled by Broomstick. The race,
while no doubt was won by the best
colt, was unsatisfactory to the public,
as was hoped and Interpreted.
The sport was marred to-day by the
fatai injury of Jockey SwabeiL In the
second race Opuntia, on the back
stretch, fell at a jump, threw Swabell
and rolled on him. The jockey died
6hortly afterward in a hospital. Sum

cave for a moment, when McGee chal

shook Corrlgan's horse off In disdain,
however, and, finishing resolutely, had
nothing to bother her through the final
furlong.
English Lad ran prominently until
the far turn was reached, where he fell
back. He came again under the whip,
but showed plainly that he waa trained
off and needs a rest badly. The stake
had a gross value of $7370, the winner's
share being $5170. Time. 2:07, marked
a good performance, as Hawthorne

were well backed by the Callfornlans.

Sabbath, following as it does the sol
emn fast of the Ninth Ab, which com
memorates the destruction of the Jew
ish commonwealth in Palestine, em
phasizes the optimism, the. hopeful
ness and the faith of the Jew in the
goodness of God and the golden pos
sibilities of man. â¢
The rabbi said that writers have
spoken of Jewish history as the great
est tragedy, but Judaism, does not take
such a gloomy view of th^t history.
Judaism looks upon suffering and
struggle as discipline which develops
and strengthens character. Judaism
further looks upon Jewish suffering
as suffering for an ideal arid suffering
for an ideal is no suffering at all. It
does not afford pleasure to the physi
cal sense, but it forms the greatest
delight to the soul. And because of
this view Judaism calls upon its fol
lowers never to lose faith in them
selves, in humanity and in God.

There is also a Â«tatute against alien

thorizing "all his Majesty s good sub
jects" to "take, apprehend, imprison
and execute to death the said Egip
tians (Gypsies), either men or

The work of compiling the directory
began May 1 and was completed within
three* weeks by 465 canVasser3, about
fifty more men than were employed
last year. One of the precautions
adopted to insure accuracy was the
striking out from last year's directory
of all names of persons dying, as re
ported by the health department. An
elaborate system of checking was also
followed by which mistakes in spelling
were avoided.â Chicago Chronicle.
"Which of these enumerations was
correct is a matter not easily deter
mined, but, as has been shown in pre
vious years, it is evident that either
the census of 1830 was padded by many
thousands of fictitious names or else
the census of 1900 was taken so care
lessly and inefficiently that in deter
mining the present population of the
city the census of 1890 should be alto
gether disregarded."
Charles J. Aabel, an engineer living
at 53 North State street, is the first citi
zen of Chicago in the sense that hi3
name. heads the long list of names. A
man of the same name stood at the
head last year. The last name of the
657,000 contained in the directory Is
that of Joseph Zywa, 4842 South Eliza
beth street. Last year one of his
countrymen, John Zyzna, brought up
the rear of the constantly increasing
procession of citizens who owe 'allegi
ance to Chicago.
JOHNSONS MOST NUMEROUS.
As lias been observed by the direc
tory publishers for years, the Jtfhnsons
are very much in evidence. They crowd
more pages of names than anybody
else and the Smiths come in a close
second. The Olsons, the Joneses and
the Browns are just as numerous as
ever.
"It is obvious that this method elim
inates the residual error which might
obtain In the use of a fractional num
ber, and the result should be correct
if the United States census figures
were correct. Unfortunately, however,
a problem is at once presented to Chi
cago because of the enormous discrep
ancy in results obtained by this meth
od when' based on the census of 1S90
as compared with that of 1900.
SMALJL CHANCE OF ERROR.
The publisher's estimate of the pop
ulation is not determined by using an
arbitrary multiple, as is generally un
derstood, but is based on the figures
of the Federal census. The process is
as follows: "The ratio between the
number of names in a directory in a
census year is assumed to be one of
the members of an arithmetical pro
portion from which may be derived
the population in any given year when
the number of directory names in that
year is established.
The estimate of the directory com
pany's population last year was 2,231,
000, based on the United States cen
sus of 1890. It is admitted in the pub
lisher's preface to the directory that
it makes a great difference what basis
is adopted for reckoning the city's pop
ulation The preface states: '"If the
census of 1900 is assumed to be a basis
from which to estimate the present
population of Chicago, as determined
by the ratio of directory names in 1904
in comparison with those ot 1900, the
present population is 1,910,700."
METHOD OF RECKONING.
The directory, which will appear on
or about July 20, will be larger than
ever, sustaining its reputation of be
ing the largest city directory in the
world. The increase in size, however,
represents the addition of but 3000
names, owing to the fact that the can
vassers have excluded the names of a
large number of unmarried women not
engaged in business. This process of
elimination, as explained by Manager
Smith, was adopted because such resi
dents of the city were best represented
in the directory by"the names of heads
of families.
As compared with the figures ob
tained by the census compilers em
ployed by the Government in 1900 he
will stake his reputation on the cor
rectness of the company's figures.
"The publishers have confidence in
the statistics gathered by men whose
life training has fitted them for the
work," said Manager Smith, "as com
pared with the results obtained by a
staff of political appointees without
training or special capacity for their
task. Chicago's present population is
2,241,000."
Let the members of the Three Million
Club cheer up and silent be the mouths
of the scoffers in rival cities. Chicago
has a population of 2,241,000, according
to the estimate made yesterday by the
Chicago Directory Company, which is
about to issue its annual list of names
of the residents of the city.
The estimate is based on the ratio
between the population in 1890, as
shown bv r the Government census, and
the number of names in the directory
of that year. This ration is applied to
the number of names In the 1904 direc
tory, with the given results. The in
crease over last year shown is 10,000
inhabitants, the usual annual increase
In Chicago. Henry L. Smith, manager
of the company which has been issu
ing the city directory for years, has
the utmost confidence in the reliability
of the estimate prepared by the ex
perts in the company's employ.
SCOFFS AT LAST CENSUS.
The convoy of the Ohio on her trial
trip will be the gunboat Annapolis, the
torpedo-boat destroyer Preble and the
tugs Fortune and Unadilla, The tor
pedo-boat destroyers Paul Jones and
Oliver Perry, which have just returned
from a cruise to Puget Sound, will act
as stakeboats. The Paul Jones is now
at the navy yard getting a supply of
coal, equipment stores and tidal data.

OAKLAND, July 2L\â .More trouble
has been added to the already heavy
burden that rests upon the shoulders
of Warren C. Stowe. who, in order to
earn money enough 1o bring his only
sister to California, deserted the United
States cruiser Deston while the vessel
wa3 being repaired at the .Mare Island
navy yard. On July 14, three weeks
alter his desertion, Stowe was arrested
In this city, where h$. had 'obtained em
ployment as gateman on the Seventh
strtot local train.
Now comes the news that when his
sifiter, Edna Stowe, 17 years of age,
learned of his arrest she disappeared
from the home of her stepmother, with
whom nfie has been living in Kansas
City, ar.d her relatives fear that her
disappointment and grfcf at the" arrest
of her brother have driven her to makÂ»:
awcy with herst/lf. .
Information of the girl's disappear
ance came in a letter to Edward C
Webster, n coufIh of the Stowes, who
lives at 1304 Eighth avenue. The letter
is from Webster's slater, who is now
In the East. She that as soon as
the information of Stove's arrest
reached his sister she disappeared and
has not yet been found.
Webster has taken up th& cause of
the young deserter.! He will brine; all
possible Influence to bear to get thi?boy
out of his trouble and If possible ob
tain his discharge from the Govern
ment service. He has written . to the
Secretary of the Navy aftsjlj- Jo . Com
mander Hobart of the Boston, stating
the facts of the case. He will also en
deavor to induce Victor H. Metcal.f.
Secretary of Commerce and Labor, to
intercede , In Stowe's behalf. Webster
said to-day:
"A few days after "Warren Stowe de
serted from the navy he came to me,
and after telling me of Edna's trouble
asked me to help him get a position
OAKLAND. July 25. â F. A. Durant,
who lives at- 1412 West street, an
employe of the United States Dredging
Company, was seized with severe
cramps shortly, after eating his lunch
at noon to-day and it Is- thought he
wus poisoned from eating strawber
ries. He became unconscious and
the Morgue wagon was called, but it
was found that he was still alive and
he was taken to the Receiving Hos
pital, where ha responded to treat
ment and was socn pronounced out of
danger.
Thinks Berries Were Poisonous.
In order that he might earn money
enough to bring her to California. He
said nothing, about having deserted and
I supposed he had been discharged, ho
I told him I w-ould do aliâ J- could for
him. I also said that as soon as be
could arrange for his sister to come to
the coast she could make, her home
with me until he was in a position to
take care of her.
"The next day he came to me and
told me that be had found employment
with the Southern Pacific Company. I
at once arranged for him to get hia
uniform, and he went . to work. The
next thing I heard of the boy was that
he had been arrested for desertion, and
then the whole s.tory came out. I know,
that Warren's motive In deserting was
a noble one, and I am going to do all 1
can to help him out of his trouble.
"The life of Warren's sister Edna has
for some months been anything but
happy. Several years ago both War
ren and his brother Howard left home.
Last February her father, Henry M.
Stowe, died, leaving her iu the care of
her stepmother". Edna never was hap
py with her father's second wife, who
at times treated her unkindly. For this
reason the s'rl wished to come here
and keer> house for her brothers. How
ard Stowe Is now employed by the
Southern Pacific Company, and it was
partly through his influence that War
ren was able to get a position with the
company."
Stow*> enlisted in the navy at Kansas
City. Mo., on April 19. 1901, and until
his desertion had an excellent record in
the service. After his arrest he was
taken back to Mare Island, where he
was. placed in irons to await trial. The
Boston is now being coaled and pro
visioned for an extended cruise In the
north. She will leave the navy yard on
August 5 and will be gone for several
months.

The trustees for the settlement will
find the greatest burden in raising
money for running expenses. The
property of the settlement has all been
given free of encumbrance by Mrs.
Hearst. .This property consists of the
interior equipment of the settlement
house, the gymnasium building, with
its sloyd room and equipment and the
lot on which this building stands.
Up to date $590 has been pledged by
friends of the settlement for its con
tinuance. The remaining amount need
ed will be solicited by a committee on
finance txTiSistlng of Professor Adolph
C. MiMer, Profe$sor E. J. WIckson.
President. Wheeler, Professor Ernest C.
Moore and Hart Greensfelder.
Three hundred children were mem
bers of the settlement during the last
school term. They received Instruction
in all the arts and trades. The insti
tution has played a great part in refin
ing the children of the district. The
teaching force is supplied by the Uni
versity of California, whose students
have daily classes.
The West Berkeley Social Settlement,
from which Mrs. Phoebe Hearst recent
ly withdrew her support, Is in a fair
way to be continued. The efforts that
have been maklng-for the reorganiza
tion c-f th.> workN since it lost Mrs.
Hearst's backing will probably b2 suc
cessful. A meeting of prominent peo
ple uf the town atid gown was held
last night in the settlement building
in. West Berkeley and the undertaking
was regularly organized. It is proposed
first to form a corporation that will
hjive control of the property and
finances and then to solicit enough
money to k*ep it going for at least two
years. This means that $6000 must be
raised.

convalescent, friends ef the family are
beginning: to rlan little welcome home
affairs for Misses Florence and Coralie
Selby, who recently returned after a
long absence in New York and Europe.
The Selby gir!s are no less popular than
their handsome mother, and th?y will
without doubt be the motif for^ some of
the smartest affairs of the winter. Mrs.
Harry East Miller was hostess yester
day at the initial event In honor* of the
returned travelers, and. as may be ex
pected when Mrs! Miller entertains. It
was a drtirrhtful affair. Just a few old
friends were invited in and they en-
Joyed a cup of tea while the Misses
Selby, in their own merry fashion, gave
many an interesting reminiscence of
their travels and experiences while
away. Among those who enjoyed the
afternoon were: Mrs. Harrison Clay,
Miss Laura Prather, Miss Annie Miller,
Miss Carrie Havens, Mr?. George
Sterett Wheaton, Miss Bessie Palmer,
Miss Elizabeth McNear, Miss Georgia
Shanklin, Mrs. Frederick K. Mapee,
Mrs. Oscar Fitzalan Long, Mrs. Edson

tempts to Jump Out of ;r
Window â Now in- Custody
Putnam's actions had been such of
late, that his wife feartd to live with
him. They were married twelve years
ago at Placerville and had lived at
Boca and Truckee. He had been su
perintendent of an ice plant at Ice
land, Cal. Of late, however, Putnam
had been acting strangely. He was
very profane and flew into/violent fits
of anger. Mrs. Putnam finally be
came afraid he might do her or the
children violence and took the step
the did to get a separation. He had
often threatened to commit suicide.
She was heartbroken when she heard
of what her husband* had done and
followed him to the hospital, calling
upon him not to die, but to come back
to her again. Putnam leaves property
to the value of 55000, besides a life
Insurance policy.
Putnam yesterday went to B. P.
Woolner. Mrs. Putnam's attorney, and
intimated that he might end his own
life.
"Carrie: Forgive me for this act.
God will reward you for your good
ness. .You must try and get the in
surance. I think you will get it all
right. I hope co. ' Good-by, the last
time. Let the children forget me If
they will. A. P."
Good-by. â¢ A. PUTNAM."
Before taking the fatal potion,
however. Putnam wrote another let
ter, in which he asksd the forgiveness
of hie wife for what he was about to
do and told hen. to let the children
forget him if they could. It reads as
follows:
"P. S. â You want to let R. F. Jack
e'_t. know your address so he will not
b&ve Â£ny ercuse for no-t paying you.
everybody's friendship and the love of
my v.-jfe and children. So I will bid
you all guod-by, with kicsea. The I. O.
O. F. will bury me. May God be good
to you all. ALBERT PUTNAM.
"My dear wife and babiesâ I find that
I am a failure in every respect. I am
CO pood whatever, only to throw away
v.hat little we have and make every
body unhappy. So I will cross the
river and see what then: is over there.
The way I have acted here I have lost
The letters tell their own story and
rhuw that while he knew he had done
wrong he eeemingly had not been able
to control himself at the times when
he abused his wife ar.d frightened her.
The first one is as fellows:
"Oakland. Cal., July 22.
It is not known at what hour Put
ram took the poison. The letters were
dated July 22 and it is thought that
probably he had finished writing them
before midnight. What time elapsed
after he finished his writing before he
took the poison is uncertain. As soon
as he vas found a call was sent In for
thÂ» police patrol and he was hurried
to '.he Receiving Hospital, where Stew
ard Harry Borchert immediately set to
v.ork to do what he could to save the
man** life. The effects of the drug,
however, had gone too far and after
lingering until the afternoon Putnam
died.
Putnam was served with a co-py of
the complaint yestcrv'uiy cad during the
day his wife left their home and taking
their two children, a girl and a boy ot
r.ine ard seven years respectively,
F'ept at a neighbor's house not far
away. She v. as fearful, however, of
the effect her act might have upon him
end at 6 o'clock this morning sent over
to ihe house to t-ee bow he war;. Her
fears were fully justified. Putnam was
found lying on a bed in an uncon
scious condition. By his side was an
empty lx>t!le labeled ""carbolic acid."
Because his -wife. Carrie L. Putnam,
began an action for divorce against
him. Albert Putnam of 1C67 Market
Etreet took a dore of ca: belie acid
tome time last night and died at the
receiving; Hospital this afternoon
nbout 4 o'clock. The Icza of his wife's
affection and tho trouble he had
brought upon her and their two chil
dren made him believe that he was a.
menace to them as well as to himself.
Ar expreerÂ«d 'n two notes, which he
left, explaining the reason for his act,
he. felt himself an outcast.

Potatoes, Onions and Vegetables.
The seneral tone of the Potato market was
cne of easiness with most holders trying to
force rales. One of the river boats arrived
late with a heavy cargo and as a result there
was an unusually large quantity unsold at the
close. Dealers wers still exacting high prices
for Onions, but trade was quieter than pre
viously.
Tratfe In miscellaneous vegetables was active
under the usual extra demand for Sunday re
quirements, but supplies of most kinds wen
still exces>"tve, and despite tlÂ« Increased
trading, prices continued to decline. Okra was
selling by the box at easier rates and Green
Pepper". Egg Plant. String oar.s and Corn
were lower. Poor Corn from Stockton and
vicinity was offering at 50Â®Â»i5c per sack, but
founii few buyers, owing to the abundance and
comparative cheapness of good stock from
other jsectlars. Tomatoes werÂ» rather' firm
during- the early trade, but weakened upon the
arrival of the belated river boat, which brought
large consignments.

SUMMARY OF THE MARKETS.
CHICAGO. July 23.â A sharp declin* at
Liverpool, brighter prospects of maintaining
the peace between Great Britain and Russia
and favorable weather throughout the United
States cave the wheat market a weak open
ing. Initial quotations on Ssptember were
down %@%C to T /d@lc at S6;Â»SS7',ic. Senti
ment In the pit appeared to have undergone
a radical change and there were more bears in
evidence than had been eeen m a long time.
More favorable crop reports from the South
west and Northwest, together with an increased
movement of new wheat, were largely respon
sible for the change of feeling. There was
general selling at the opening and thÂ« presaurw
to sell reached a higher tÂ»n3ion as soon as
the pit crowd discovered that little support
was forthcoming frcm recent bull leaders.
During the day there were ens or two slight
rallies en covering by shorts, but the gen
eral news was against higher prices. About
the enly bull factor was a rumor of fresh
seizures of British, ships by the Russian vol
unteer fleet, but little attention was given
the report. The low point oa September was
reached at S8%Â®SU %c. The market was in
clined to drag throughout the day and the
close was heavy, with September at. S(JJ-,c
In sympathy with influential selling of corn
early. 3ertember opened to 14c lower
at 48tfâ¬49Kc to 49VÂ»c. sold off to 40c and
closed at. 43<g-49Uc.
Under the influence of wheat, sentiment in
thÂ» Â«?ata pit was a little easier, but there was
enoujrh local support to hold prices Fteady at
the dÂ«ct!iw. September closed at S2TVÂ«frl3c.
The local buying t? shorts late in the ses
sion caused small advances in hog products,
but for the greater part of the day trading
was practically at a standstill, owing to the
strike. September pork closed with a gain of

th* 'supply exceeds the demand and the off
graded are beinr : pressed for sale and sent to
store. There Is nothing: in the way of export
business, and none se?ms possible or at least
probable with the present range of values.
â¢There is a pause In speculative buying./- While
we are net Advocating the. abort side of wheat
very strongly en the September and Decem
ber, yet we are inclined to think that the free
movement will further extinguish cash prc
ratnms and that the weakness therein will
bring about some further decline in th* fu
tures. Croa advices from the Northwest are.
on the whole, very favorable. The only com
plaint is that the crop la a little late."

There will be grocers at this con
vention from all parts of California,
since the grocers now have associa
tions in all of the larger cities of tha
State. They will decide upon tha
laws that the merchants will units
in asking of the Legislature, which
convenes in January. They will also
perfect their plans for the co-opera
tion of the collection bureaus of the
different associations, so that dead
beats moving from one city to another
will find that their fame has followed
them very closely.
A beautiful diamond locket was
presented to the retiring president.
Thomas H. Corcoran, by the members
of the board of directors, over whom
he had presided during the past year.
President J. Salomon appointed a
committee, consisting of Vice Presi
dent Frank B. Connolly, Director E.
A. Lackmann and State President Jo
seph A. Stultz. to wait upon the Bul
letin and protest against the action of
that paper in exploiting trading
stamps. The San Francisco grocers
are working hard on their celebration
â¢>f "grocers' day," which is to be held
this year at Schuetzen Park on "Wed
nesday, August 10. Committees re
ported progress in the work of their
preparations, and all the details are
well in hand. Already agreements
have been circulated among the retail
qrocers. nnd It Is expected that even
the few dealers who are not members
of the organization will close their
stores to help make the celebration
general. v'- Â¦ '
San Francisco retail grocer* will ba
very strongly represented at tha fifth
annual convention of the California
State Grocers' Association, which
meets at San Jose on Monday and
Tuesday, August 22 and 23.

You must Imagine 50.000 UttI* boys
and girls, with wonderful brown eyes,
fiat little noses and black hair, packing
their books and slates to school each
morning under the blue skies and
tropic sun of Fillplnla. And even In
the Islands where the towns are very
far apart the smallest vlllaga would
be very much ashamed If It did not
have some kind of a school for nines.
It Is very quiet In these Islands and
the days seem to pass by Ilka dreams.
Only the distant clans of convent bells.
the liquid bird notes or the sleepy
challenge of a cock disturbs the peace
ful silence of the southern Isles.
The little villages are all alikeâ A bis
cathedral and a rambling convent look-
Ing out upon the sparkling sea, tha
carabaos and ponies grazing on tho
plaza and a few pigs running wild
among the bamboo houses under the
banana trees. In some such town, 10,
000 miles away from everybody, yoa
Â¦would be surprised some morning If
you were to hear the small, clear voices
of the children singing one of your own
songs: "My Country, 'TIs of Thee.**
or "The Star- Spangled Banner."
Maybe you would liks to know first
something about the Spanish schools
established by the friars, which tha
little people of the Philippines attended
In the days before tho battle of Manila
Bay. In many places Spanish schools
are still kept up. It is a common sight
to see along the narrow stone streets of
Manila a procession of small Filipino
boys in blue suits, baggy trousers and
black derby hats, taking their dally
walk, conducted by the padres In whlta
robes. In these colejlos the little fel
lows study Spanish grammar, elemen
tary arithmetic, geometry, astronomy
and the religion of the Catholic faith.
The college graduate smokes cigar
ettes and dresses very daintily. He la
effusively polite, and has a fine con
tempt for anything like work. He la
about original enough to bo a good
clerk or escribierte in a country whera
unnecessary hurry never spoils tho la
bored neatness of his work.
Some of my friends would navÂ» a
rather bad opinion of the small boys
of Manila if they were to sea thÂ« llttla
rascals of the Calle Real or tha Es
colta struggling with cigars almost aa
big as a banana or engaged In pitching
pennies Sunday morning In the street.
The public schools, ho-wever. keep the
small boy out of mischief for a good

CHINESE CAMP, July 23.â The old
mining town of Bigoak Flat was almost
wiped out of existence this morning
by a fire which originated in a
lodging-house conducted by W. H.
Dodge. The flames rapidly spread to
the adjoining building6 and destroyed
the Marconi dwellings, the Golden build
ing, the Bigoak Flat Hotel, Jordan's
store and dwelling, the Breen Hotel and
several other buildings. The origin of
the fire Is a mystery, but is supposed
to be of incendiary origin, several mys

Owing to the great mining activity,
the buildings, will be reconstructed as

ALIi ITEMS OF FINANCE
SHOW HIGH FIGURES
NEW YORK, July 23.â The Financier
says: The striking features of the offi
cial statement of the New "SJork Asso
ciated Banks last week were the un
precedented high averages of all tha
items except surplus reserve which has
been recorded since July 9, 1SDS, when
it was at $33,345,300. In June of that
year It will be remembered the surplus
had been almost weekly augmented be
cause of operations incident to the
placing of the war loan of 1S03 and it
reached a maximum of $52,206,250 on
June 25, subsequently gradually de
creasing.
The cash reserve increased last week
by J11.S14.700, or $1,315,200 more than
that which was estimated upon the
basis of the traceable movements oÂ£
money during the week, indicating that
the discrepancies between the estimated
and the officially reported movements of
cash, which until the previous week
were quite marked, are being corrected.
There Is still, however, a difference of
more than $13,000,000 between the total
gain for the past four weeks as Indi
cated by the estimates and the In
crease recorded by the bank statement;
thl3 difference may possibly be cor
rected In the returns of later weekj.
The deposits were increased $22,273,800
and the required reserve was thereby
augmented by J5.53S.456, deducting
which from the gain in cash as above
leaves $6,046,250 as the increase in sur
plus reserve to $50,600,600.
Computed upon the basis of deposits,
less those of $23,343,200 public
funds, the surplus is $56,445,400. The In
crease in deposits, It may be noted, was
less by $1,671,400 than the sum of the
gain in cash and the Increase In loans
showed the statement did not balance.
CALIFORNIA FISHERMEN
ARE 3IADE DEFENDANTS
ASTORIA. Or.. July 23.â Suit has
been commenced by representatives of
the Columbia River Fishermen's Pro
tective Union against three California
fishermen who have been flshins: at
Astoria. The complaint filed recites
that the man are not American citizens
and not residents either of Oregon or
"Washington, as the laws of both States
provide fishermen shall be. The case
Is In reality a test of the constitution
ality of the fishing laws now in force
In Oregon and Washington, which
provide that fishing licenses may ba
issued only to citizens of the two
States. The union complains that non
residents have been granted licenses
by the authorities and that the suit
is to stop the practice.

Roberts lost his balance and fell be

was terribly mangled.

The United States torpedo-boat de

yesterday from Bremerton. They will
leave in a few days for the Santa Bar

The H. J. Corcoran, the river steamer
plying between this city and Vallejo, Is
now using her new slip, which, al
though geographically described as be
ing at the foot of Clay street, is really
at the northern extremity of the ferry
depot. The Harbor Commissioners have
treated the new Vallejo line handsome
ly in the way of accommodations, and
as far as the convenience of passengers
is concerned Vallejo-bound travelers
now find easier access to their boat
than do Southern Pacific, Key Route or
Santa Fe patrons. The Corcoran's new
landing is nearer to the cars than any
other slip In the ferry depot, and com
muters who leave themselves small lee
way for the catching of other boats
are casting envious eyes at the unin
terrupted sprinting stretch that leads
to the Vallejo steamer's gangway.
Now Part of Ferry System.
The goats chew cans in anybody's

Mayor Schmitz says that Harry Ir
win has the sole right to administer
knock-out drops to four-footed or
phans. The Supervisors in an ordi
nance state that the Humane Society
owns the exclusive privilege of putting
the quietus on homeless dogs. Hence
there Is a suit in the Superior Court
and immunity for canine hoboes.
The city appropriates $7000 a year to
provide painless deaths and decent
burials for the surplus dog population.
Besides this money the fines paid for
some of the dog: and cattle vagrants
amount to something. These facts
make the suit interesting.
Until two years ago the Humane So
cley had the work. Then the Mayor
appointed Harry Irwln poundmaster.
Last October the Supervisors rein
stated the Humane Society. Com
plaints were made that Irv.in reduced
the fines for dog vagrancy and appro
priated them. The tales were not veri
fied, but the Supervisors stood pat for
the society. So the matter rests.
The Humane people have closed their
dog morgue and jail. Irwin does a lit
tle dog catching now and then, but it
is said that he only Imprisons the aris
tocratic canines. Any bewhiskereU
kaiser Is given the go-by whose fea
tures have not that repose which
marks the caste of Vere de Vere.

The nearest library west of San Fran
cisco, that of the Honolulu Library As
sociation, has had a prosperous year.
The net gain in membership for the
twelve months has been sixty, making
a total of 250. A cordial welcome to the
rooms is extended to strangers, very
many of whom during their stay highly
value these privileges.
In Pasadena the Public Library Board
is pursuing the wise policy of buying
valuable old works on early California
history. A recent purchase embraced a
set of Hutchings* Magazine, the first
magazine published in the State, from
1S56 to 1861; John C. Fremont's expedi
tion, Leonard Kip's California sketches,
Farnham's "Early Days in Califor
nia," E. C. Capron's "History of Cali
fornia" and others of equal interest.
As these works have long been out of
print and are eagerly sought for by
many libraries the day is not far dis
tant when it will be Impossible to pro
cure them.
Ferndale, a promising town in Hum
boldt County, has by ordinance just
paJsed established a public library.
Mountain View, Santa Clara County,
incorporated in 1902, has a new women's
club, which for its first work has begun
agitation for a public library.
Willows, Glenn County, has a Wom
an's Christian Temperance Union,
which has the use of a room in the City
Hall for a free library, to be supported
by the union.
Salinas is considering the possibility
of starting a free library. Aleli Parlor
No. 101, Native Daughters of the Gold
en West, leads In this undertaking.
The Berkeley public library is the re
cipient from Miss Elizabeth Tompkins
of seventy volumes of valuable works
on various subjects. From Joseph P.
Moore, a veteran of the Civil War, this
library received a complete set of the
records of the war. The set, containing
124 volumes of records and thirty-five
volumes of war maps, was Issued by
the War Department. This work is be
coming rare. The Berkeley library evi
dently has a strong hold on public fa
vor. Its annual report shows ownership
of 15,000 volumes, with an active circu
lation of over 93,000.
The Twentieth Century Club, a wom

COLLECTS STATE HISTORY.
At Campbell, Santa Clara County,
a free reading-room has just been
opened by the combined efforts of the
Christian Endeavor and Epworth
League societies. Business men and
others have given liberally toward its
maintenance. There are scores of places
in California, many of them larger than
Campbell, which could easily support a
reading-room and small library if a few
public spirited citizens would lead- in
such an effort.
SMALL TOWN'S GOOD WORK
The Carnegie building in San Bernar
dino is finished and will soon be occu
pied. It is a handsome structure of
pressed brick and cost $20,000.
Santa Monica's building, erected by a
$12,500 gift from Carnegie, has been
completed and accepted by the Library
Trustees. The lot, 100 by 150 feet, was
bought by a general subscription for
$3750.
During the last month the American
Beet Sugar Company of Oxnard, Ven
tura County, has reopened its reading
room for the benefit of its employes.
The room is 20 by 50 feet, is provided
with games, papers and magazines and
is lighted by electric lights.
A striking Instance of the effective
work of women's clubs In the founding
of public libraries Is shown In the
growth of the Lewiston, Idaho, public
library. The story is a simple one. Four
years ago the Tscemlnicum Club of
Lewiston determined to start a free
library. They first placed a few vol
umes on a shelf in the Council cham
ber and declared that a library had
been created. A series of entertain
ments followed, enlisting public sym
pathy and obtaining a good sum of
money. Before long the bookshelves
became- crowded and removal was made
to the main room of the City Hall,
which has been the home of the library
for two years. There are now 4004 vol
umes on hand, and the popularity of
the library is evidenced by a home cir
culation of 23,000 in the last year. An
appeal by the club to Andrew Carnegie
brought a gift; of $10,000, which was ex
pended on the building soon to be
opened.
The State of Washington is greatly
increasing the scope and efficiency of
its State library at Olympia. A medical
department has been created and 1000
volumes for its shelves have been re
ceived. It is intended ultimately to
make this department as useful to the
medical profession as the law library is
to the legal profession. Within two
years fully $16,000 will be expended on
the State library..
"It was with great difficulty 'that I
managed to proceed with my part to
night, for I have grown so weak that
the slightest exertion exhausts me. I
have been suffering from an attack of
bronchitis and this has been aggra
vated by nervousness resulting from my
anxiety to complete my engagement.
My physician thinks that two weeks of
absolute rest will rid me of my ailment
and allow me to return to the stage a
week later In Denver. It Is on his ad
vice that I have prepared for a trip
to Arcadia."
Pretty Ethel Barrymore has been
ordered by her physician to forsake
the stage for a time and go to a re
treat. At the close of the performance
at the Columbia Theater last evening
it was announced that Miss Barry
more's manager had canceled her en
gagements In Southern California, and
that she would not reappear' on the
stage until her falling health had
shown noticeable improvement. She
expects to go to Arcadia Monday for
a two weeks' rest. If at the end of that
period her physician regards her con
dition as favorable, the young actress
will be permitted to Journey to Den
ver, where, a week later, she is
scheduled to appear.
That her health was falling rapidly
has been known to Miss Barrymore's
intimate friends for several weeks, but
contrary to their advice and that of her
manager and physician, she has in
sisted on fulfilling her engagements.
During last night's performance she
all but collapsed, and after she had
returned to the St. Francis Hotel her
attractive face plainly bore the indi
cations of illness. In discussing her
future Miss Barrymore said:
Miss Ethelwynne Lewis, daughter of
Colonel Thomas H. Handbury, U. S.
engineer corps, will leave for Manila
on the transport Logan, sailing from
here August 1.
Miss Lucile Devol, daughter of Ma

is to go to Camp Atascadero to take
part in the big fail maneuvers.
Telrgraphic communication directly
Into the Henry ranch was completed
yesterday and is now in full working
order. Stations are now established
at both Atascadero and Asuncion,
having direct communication to
every part of the country wherever
the Western Union lines run. This
will be of great convenience to all
those interested in the maneuvers, as
well as to those participating in them.
The squadron of Ninth Cavalry and
the three field batteries which left the
Presidio on July 6 for Atascadero are
row fully installed in their quarters
there and ar^ getting the camp into
shape to receive the balance of the
troops. The water supply is found to
be more than ample and the mains are
already laid through the camp
grounds and ready for immediate use.
From General MacArthur down
everybody at army headquarters is
now busily engaged in arranging de

Speculation was rife yesterday as to
the identity of the vessel sighted off the
Australian coast May 4 by the bark
Charles B. Kenney, which arrived Fri
day night from Newcastle, Australia.
Captain Salveson thinks it was the
American ship Great Admiral, which
arrived July 2 at Honolulu, but did not
report having been in any such fix as
was the vessel sighted by the Kenney.
Captain Salveson says he sighted the
vessel May 4, in latitude 25 degrees 25
minutes south, longitude 167 degrees 46
minutes east. The distressed ship was
loaded and of American build, appar
ently of between 1300 and 1500 tons reg
ister. She was painted black and was
metal sheathed, and was steering
southwest in a strong gale from the
east-southeast. She had only lower and
upper mizzen topsails set, the main
topsail having been blown to ribbons,
which were streaming in ragged confu
sion to the wind. The jib boom was
broken in the cap. There was nothing
set on the fore or main mast. The fore
topgallant mast was raking aft so
much that it appeared to be broken in
the cap. There was steam on the don
key engine, supposedly to operate the
pumps, as the vessel appeared to be
leaking. No signals were set, however,
and the Charles B. Kenney, which was
about a mile to windward, made no ef
fort to get any closer.

When President Zelaya, chief execu
tive of the Central American republic
of Nicaragua, commissioned Pancho
Renasco to proceed to California with
$12,000 in Nlcarguan money and pur
chaso a pair of horses for the Presiden
tial carriage, he paid a higher tribute
to Renasco's judgment than to the
shrewdness of the California horse
trader.
Renasco came, bought and the horse
trader conquered.
Renasco was a passenger on the liner
Peru, which sailed yesterday for the
Central American coast He had en
gaged passage for the Presidential
horses and was at the Mail dock early
yesterday morning when the horseflesh
bought with Zelaya's $12,000 arrived at
the wharf.
In American money the commission
er's horse fund was worth about $1500.
Upon his arrival here he made a tour
of the State in search of steeds of fettle
fit to grace Nicaragua's carriage of
state. At San Jose he found th'e man
who had just what Renasco wanted.
â¢ "There's a team that President
Roosevelt has tried to get. I'm a
Democrat, however, and was not anx
ious to make the sale. They're yours
for $1500. They're worth more, but
Roosevelt Is worrying the life out me
and It's worth something to me to have
them taken out of the country."
There was a mare of uncertain age,
whose framework of bone was in ob
trusive evidence. Her eyes were sunken
and she seemed sad yesterday when
the longshoremen ushered her into a
box and hoisted her aboard the Peru.
"Bones are a sign of breeding," the
dealer had told Renasco. "I kept her
thin so that whoever bought her could
satisfy himself she was all there and
sound. It was the curve of those ribs
that first fascinated Roosevelt."
The mare's mate was a red-eyed
stallion, with a habit of testing the
temper of his teeth on whatever or
whoever happened to wander, within
his reach.
"The only pair of carriage horses of
Its kind in America," the dealer had
said.
The stallion was driven into a box.
Captain Wilson said, "Hoist away.*
The Peru's \vinc.h started and up went
the box .full of stallion.
. There was a pause between the end
of the ascent and the hauling of the
box inboard. When the winch stopped
the stallion began.
He kicked out the rear gate of his
suspended stall.
"Hurry up," said Captain "Wilson.
The stallion's hurry was greater,
however, and before the echo of Wil
son's voice died out four hoofs and a
set of sharp teeth were playing havoc
with the swinging stall.
It rained kindling wood and tenpenny
nails for a short but exciting spell.
Then came a crashing of timbers and
down on the wharf fell a breathless
and badly bruised stallion.
Pancho Renasco sailed on the Peru
with the undamaged half of his Amer
ican bargain. If the stallion can be
patched up it will be forwarded later.
"Americans can't ship horses," said
a Nicaraguan on the wharf.
"They know how to sell them."

only defense for the rock-throwing was

When the veteran pleader asked for
a further continuance of the case In
which he represented the defendant, a

why and he reluctantly said that his
client was not present.
I'll continue it," said his Hon
or, "after I have gone through the
usual preliminary of forfeiting her bail
and issuing a bench warrant for her
arrest."
The veteran pleader gasped thrice ere
he could command speech. Then he
exclaimed: "If you forfeit th&t
woman's bail I'll drop dead right hera"
"From which I infer that your pe
cuniary Interest In her extends beyond
the possibility of receiving a fee," said
the Judge. "Well, as I don't care to

murder, I'll allow the ball to stand till

These are bad days for the chronic

Half a dozen of him, in various stages
of dirt and dilapidation, were reviewed
by Judge Fritz yesterday morning and
each was sent to Jail for a term that
will not expire until the fruit-picking
season is long past.
"These fellows seem to prefer Im
prisonment to work," said his Honor,
as the motley gang shuffled away, ap
parently more gratified than distressed
by their sentences, "and I think that

After renting a room somewhere In
the Western Addition' and depositing
therein his gripsack, Julius Kohler
went out and drank bo much beer that
he lost recollection of where he dwelt.
While seeking his apartment he twice
called at 36 Birch avenue and in
quired if he lived there, and the sec
ond answer In the negative enraged
him to such an extent that he became
abusive, whereupon the lady of the
house blew three shrill blasts of a
whistle. The policeman who promptly
responded caught a glimspe of Kohl
er's coattall as it flew around a corner,
and then began a stern chase that
covered many blocks.
In the court of Judge Conlan a plea
of drunkenness was entered by Mr.
Kohler and his conduct was so queer
as to create a suspicion that his mind
was rather awry. The case was con
tinued till Monday, by wolch time the
person from whom he rented the room
may have learned of his predicament
and come to the rescue.
The officers say they found Miss Ker
nandaz en dishabille and Mr. Raymond
fully clothed, and that the apartment
looked as if effort had been made to
reduce Its furniture to Junk. The wom
an eaid the man did it, his only provo
cation being the fact that she on her
way home from the theater had spoken
to a gentleman who had spoken to her
first. Mr. Raymond, she averred, was
intensely jealous, though, goodness
knew, he had no reason to be, as she
appreciated her wifely dignity and al
ways was particular to comport herself,
on and off the stage, as a perfect lady.
But even If ehe had been as unfaithful
to her nuptial vows as he evidently
suspected her of being, was that any

stained from giving the police any ex
planation of his conduct further than
to express an opinion that he "guessed
a man's wife was his wife and he had
a right to discipline her."
The hatpin and the fragments of the
marriage certificate are held as evi
dence In the case.
After delighting a large and cultured
audience In a .Montgomery avenue con
cert hall last Friday night Miss Hazel
Hernandez, billed as "the bewitching
little eniDress of scng," went to her
apartment lna lodging-house on Kear
ny street, near Clay, and there became
engaged In an altercation with her
husband, George Raymond, who holds
headline distinction on the programme
of the north Bide temple of vaudeville,
where he does a dialect monologue
stunt Miss Hernandez and Mr. Ray
mond do not tell exactly the same story
as to what occurred In the room be
tween the time of her arrival there and
the moment v.hen she stuck her head
through an open window and shouted
"Po-leece!" many times in high C
sharp. Bhe was still shrieking when
Policemen Charles Brown and Al Hol
nian, who ran from the Hall of Justice
when her first note rang out, clirnbed
the etairs and burst open the door. It
Is upon what they then saw and heard
th?t Judg* Conlan will depend when he
hears the charge of disturbing the
peace against the actor and the actress
next Wednesday.
William Cook, a 6oldler, pleaded guil
ty to something and Judge Fritz gave
him sixty days in the .County Jail. He
was arrested for attempting to de
fraud a restaurant man at the Pre
sidio by presenting a check purporting
to have been signed by an army pay
master, but when it was discovered
that one of the Initials in the signature
was not that of the paymaster in ques"
tion the charge of forgery fell through.
Then the prosecution substituted a
charge of passing a fictitious check,
but that accusation, too, went to pieces
when it was ascertained that no money
was received by the defendant. While
the prosecution was thinking up anoth
er charge, the defendant's dishonest in
tent being apparent, the defendant an-
"Dey won't let me have de dough be
cause dey fink I'm under de age of
respenserbility," said the pugilist to
the Judge.
"If you are old enough to put money
in bank you certainly are sufficiently
aged to draw It out again," was the
Judicial tip.
Augustus looked as if he had seen
about twenty summers. He and Whit
ner had hired a horse and buggy and
driven the animal until It was crippled.
Milton Whitner and Manuel Augus
tus, accused of cruelty to animals, told
Judge Fritz that they were unable N to
raise any money to pay a fine. Then
the policeman who arrested them
stated that Augustus was a prizefighter
and had recently deposited in bank
$100, which he won by knocking out
an opponent.
"You'd better draw on your bank
account," said the Judge to the pugi
list.
"You're drunk, and if you don't
gwan I'll put you where you can't get
any drunker," was Desmond's retort.
The man staggered away, but about
five minutes later reappeared at the
same spot, and, triumphantly holding
up. a small wooden clock for the po
liceman's Inspection, shouted:
"I said you were wrong, and that
clock proves I'm right."
But the clbck proved nothing, as
one of its hands was missing and It
looked as if it had been out of com
mission for years.
"Where did you get that clock?" the
officer inquired.
"Got it in a church around there,"
was the reply.
With man and clock In custody the
policeman visited all the churches In
the neighborhood, but all of them
were closed and none of them showed
evidence of recent burglarious entry.
Then the prisoner and the evidence
were taken to prison.
Before Judge Conlan yesterday the
man remembered that his name was
John Powers, but there his memory
stuck. He had no recollection of the
incident narrated by the policeman,
norâ had he the remotest idea of how
he became possessed of the clock. The
case was continued for further Inquiry.
Patrolman Desmond was standing at
Tenth and Howard streets Friday
afternoon when a man under the In
fluence of stimulants politicly asked
him as information as to the time of
day.
"It's about 4 o'clock," said the po
liceman.
"You must be crazy," exclaimed the
Inebriate.

"You did perfectly right," said
Judge Conlan to Mr. Alexander, who
had been arrested and charged with
battery' "and it gives me extreme
pleasure to dismiss the charge against
you."

husband that an unknown man had
