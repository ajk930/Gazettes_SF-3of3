news, and to repeat an old question
of mine. Do you know what , they, are
going to do next with your railroad?"
"Yes; Hildreth told me this after
noon-"
"Well, what are you going to do?"
"Nothing/ - There is' nothing to be
done. They haye held to the , form of
legal procedure thus far,' but they
won't doit any more. They will take
MacFarlane oft* In a corner somewhere,
have him make' Guilford permanent re
ceiver, and } the lease to the Overland
will be consummated on the spot. I
sha'n't be in it." .'
"Probably not; certainly not -if you
don't try to get in it. And that brings
me back to the old question. Are you
big enough/ David?'.'
, "If you think I haven't been big
enough to live up to my opportunities
thus far, I'm afraid I may disappoint
you again." he said doubtfully.* â¢âÂ¦
"You have disappointed me," she ad
mitted." "That is why I &m- asking:

"Portia, if I thought you : really

He anticipated her.
"You: are doing me an injustice on
the other side. now. I'll fight as furi
ously as you Â¦ like. â¢ All I ask is to be
given a weapon that won't bloody my
hands."
"Good!" she said approvingly. "I

desperate, desperate! And oh, David!
you've cot to have a cool head and a
steady hand when . you use it. If you
haven't, it will kill everybody within

Â¦man-you are trying to; reach." .
"Draw it and let me feel its edge,"
he said shortly.
Her chairs was close beside the low
swung hammock. She bent to his ear
and whispered a single sentence. For
a minute or two he sat motionless,
weighing and balancing the chance of
success against the swiftly multiplying
difficulties and hazards. .

Kent .thought about it for a ions

. Miss Van Brock's comment was a lit

"I knew you'd make difficulties -when
it came to the paying part of it, and
since I didn't know, myself. I wired
Mr. Ormsby again. Here is what he
says," and she untwisted a second tele- Â«
gram and read it to him. " 'Fee should
not be less than 5 per cent of bonded
indebtedness; four-fifths in stock at
par; one-fifth cash; no cure, no pay.* "
"Three .million five hundred thousand
dollars!" gasped Kent.
"It's only nominally that much*" sh*
laughed. "The stock part of it la mere
ly'your guaranty of good faith; It Is
worth next to nothing now. and It will.
be many a long day before it goes to

shrinks to seven hundred thousand dol
lars, less your expenses." â¢ :"
"But heavens and earth! that's aw
ful!" said Kent.
"Not when you consider it as a sur
geon's risk. You happen to be thÂ«
one man who has the Idea, and if it
isn't carried out, the patient is going
to die to-morrow night, permanently.
You are the specialist in this case, and
specialists come high. Now you may

tails, if you like."
He found his hat and stood up. ShÂ»

hand she made him sit down again.
"You have at least three degrees of

"Nothing. I assure you. I haven't

"If you don't make It too hard."

'Â¦i'*' Â¦'-; CHAPTER XXVI. ; t
On the High Plains.
Much to Elinor's relief, and quite as
much, perhaps, -to Penelope's, Mrs.
Brentwood tired of Breezeland Inn in
less than a fortnight and began to talk
of returning to the apartment-house in
the capital.
Pressed to give a reason for her dis
satisfaction, the younger sister might
have been at a 'oss to account for' It In
words; but Elinor's desire to cut the
Â¦ outing short was based upon pride and
militant shame. After many trap-set
tings she had succeeded in making
her mother confess that the j stay at
Breezeland was at Ormsby*s expense;
and not all of Mrs. Brentwood's petu
lant Justlfyings could remove the atin*
of the. nettle of obligation. .
"There is no reason in the world why
you should make so much of It: -I am
\ your mother, and. I ought to know,"
was Mrs. Brentwood's dictum. "You
wouldn't have any scruples If we .were
his guests on the Amphltrlte or. In his
country house on Long. Island." l
"That would be different." Elinor
contended. "We are not his quests
here; we are his pensioners.";
"Nonsense!" frowned" the mother.
"Isn't It beginning. to occur to you that
beggars shouldn't be choosers? And.
besides, .so far as you are concerned,
you are only anticipating a little."
. It was an exceedingly injudicious, not
to say, brutal way of putting It; and
the blue- gray eyes flashed fire. :
"Can't you see that you are , dally
making a marriage between us moro
and more impossible?" was the bitter
rejoinder. Elinor's metier was'jcool
composure under fire, but shÂ© waÂ» not
always able to compass it.
Mrs. Brentwood fanned herself -vigor
ously. She had been aching to have It
out with this self-willed young woman
who was playing fast and loose with
attainable millions, and the hour had
struck."
"What made you break It off with
Brookes Ormsby?" she snapped;, add
ing: "I don't wonder you were ashamed
to tell me about It." , *~;v
,"I did not break It off: and I was not
ashamed." Elinor had .regained her
self-control, and the angry light in the
far-seeing eyes was giving place/ to tha
cool gray â¢ blankness which she ; cultl
*vated. '
"That is what Brookes told mÂ«. but I
didn't believe ' him," said the'* mother.
"It's all wrong, anyway, and I more
Â¦than half believe David Kent is at the
. bottom of It." *
, -Elinor left her chair and went to the
'window, which looked â¢ down on the
sanitarium, the ornate' parterre, and
1 ; the " crescent driveway. ' These family
1 .bickerings were very trying to her. and
L the -longing to escape them was some
' - times strong enough to override cool
reason and her Innate sense of the flt
' ness of things. f.yi '
; :in her moments of deepest depression
â¢ she told herself, that the prolonged
-*" struggle was making' her hard and
' . cynical ; * that she was growing . more
' and . more on the Grlmkle side and
> shrinking on the Brentwood. With
' the unbending uprightness of the Grlm
â¢ kle forebears there went, a prosaic and
unmalleable strain destructive alike of
t sentiment and theÂ»arusuc ideals. This
. -strain* was 'in her blood, and. from
t childhood she had fought It, .hopefully
; at times, and at other times, as now,
t despairingly. There were tears in her
eyes when she turned to the window;
1 and if they were 'merely tears of'self
r pity, they were better than none.. Once,
5. in the halcyon summer, David Kent
had said that the most hardened crim
l inal In the . dock was less .dangerous
eral one that they won't let the grass .
grow under their feet."
"No. God blast the wnoleâ I wish I
could swear in Sanscrit. The mother
tongue doesn't begin to do justice : ; to
it. Now I know what Bucks meant'
when he told me to take my railroad, \
if I could get it. He had the whole,
thing coopered up in a barrel at that
minute." >
"I take it you have no alternative
to this," said the editor, tapping the
pile of affidavits. . 'â¢
"Not a cursed. shred of an Idea! And,
Hildrethâ V he broke off short because
once again the subject suddenly grew
too large for coherent speech.
Hildreth disentangled himself , from
the legs of his chair and stood up-toÂ«
put his hands on Kent's shoulders.
"You are up against it. hard, David,"
he said; and he repeated: "I'd give all
my old shoes to be able to help you
out."> Â¦ â¢
"I know it," said Kent; and then he
turned abruptly and went away.
Between 9 and 10 o'clock the same
evening Kent was walking the floor of
his room, trying vainly to persuade
himself that virtue was its own re
ward, and wondering if a small dose of
chloral hydrate would be defensible
under the cruel necessity for scleep.
He had about decided in favor of the
drug when a tap at the door announced
the coming of a bellboy with a note It
was a 'message from Portia.
"If you have thrown away your
chance definitely, and are willing to
take a still more desperate one, come
to see me," she wrote; and he went
mechanically, as a . drowning man
catches at a straw, knowing it will not
save him.
The house in Alameda squara was
dark when he went up the /walk; and
while he was feeling for the bell-push
his summoner called to him out of the
electric ster.cilings of leaf shadows un
der the broad veranda, .
"It is too fine a night to stay In
doors," she said. "Come and sit in the.
hammock while I scold you as you de
serve." And when he had taken i the
hammock: Â¦ ."Now - give an account of
yourself. Where have you been : for

"Wallowing around in' the ' lower

There was awe undisguised In the
look he gave her, and it had crept into
his voice when he said:
"Portia, are you really a fleah-and
blood woman?"
She ftmiled. -â¢-.'Â¦'
"Meaning, that your ancestors would
have burned me for a witch? Perhaps
they would; I think quite likely they

but it 'Is knownâ It had to be knownâ

"No."
"Well, the man had Invented some

"It . is fearfully shortâ the time, I

"We can't count on any help from any
one in authority. Guilford's broom has
swept the high salaried official cor
ners clean. But the wage people are
mutinous and ripe . for anything. I'll
go and find out where we stand." And
he groped on the floor of the veranda
for his hat.
"No, wait a minute," she interposed.
I "We are 5 not quite ready to . adjourn

three flights of stairs to the editor's
den. in the Argus building.
CHAPTER XXV.
Dead Water and Quick.
â¢ The cubby-hole In which Hildreth
earned his bread by the sweat of his
bruin was dark even at midday; and
during working hours the editor sat
under a funnel-shaped reflector in a
conic shower-bath of electric light
which flooded man and desk and left
the corners of the room in a penumbra
of grateful twilight.
Kent sat just outside of the cone
of radiance, watching Hildreth's face
as the editor read stolidly through the
contents of the box envelope. It was
an instructive study in thought dyna
mics. There was a gleam of battle
satisfaction in the editorial eye when
Hiildreth faced the last sheet down
upon the accumulation of evidence,
saying:
"You didn't overstate the fact in your
brag about the political graves. Only
this isn't a spade; it's a steam shovel.
Do I understand you are giving me
this stuff to use as I please?"
"Just that." said Kent.
"And you have made It serve your
turn, too?"
"No." Kent's voice was sharp and
crisp.
"Isn't that what you got for It?"
"Yes."
"Then why don't you use it?"
"That was what Bucks wanted to
know a little while ago when he came
to my rooms to try to buy me off. I
don't think I succeeded in making him
understand why I couldn't traffic with
it; and possibly you wouldn't under
stand."
"I guess I do. It's public property,
and you couldn't divert it into private
channels. Is that the way it struck
you?" . . '
"It's the way it ' struck a friend of
mine whose sense of ultimate right and
wrong hasn't lost its fine edge in the
world-mtlL I do not want to do it."
"Naturally," said the editor. "Giving,
it up means the loss of- all you have
been working for in the railroad game.
I wish I could use it just as it stands."
"Can't you?"
"I am afraid notâ effectively. It
would make an issue in a campaign; or,
sprung on the eve of an election, it
might down the ring conclusively. I
think it would. But this is the off year
and the people won't rise to a political
issue â couldn't make themselves felt if
they should."
"I don't agree with you. You have
your case all made out, with the evi
dence in sound legal form. What is to
prevent our trying it?" .
"The one thing that' you ought to be
lawyer enough to see at a glance. There
is no court to try it in. With the As
sembly In" session we might do some
thing; as it is we can only yap at the
, heels of the ringsters, and our yapping
won't help you in the railroad fight.
What do you hear from Boston?"
"Nothing new. The stock is still
. flat on the market, with the stock
. holders' pool holding a bare majority*
â¢ and the Plantagould brokers buying in
driblets wherever they can find a sm.aU
. holder who is willing to let go. It Is
â¢ only a Question of time, and a very
short time at that."
'? The editor wagged his head in sym
pathy.
; "I wish I could help you, David.
â¢ You've done a big thing for meâ for
[ the Argus; and all I have to hand you
[ In return Is a death sentence. Mac
. Farlane is back."
j "Here? In town?"
"Yes. And that isn't the worst of it.
, The Governor Bent for him."
â¢ "Have you any idea what is in the
\ wind?" asked Kent, dry-lipped.
, "I'm afraid I have. My young men
> have been nosing around in the Trans
. western affair and several things have
developed. Matters are . approach
. ing a crisis. The cut-rate boom
; is about to collapse and there
; is trouble brewing in the labor organi
zations. If Bucks doesn't get his hench
, men out of It pretty soon, they will be
; involved In the smash â which will be
bad for them and for him, politically."
r "I developed most or that a good
. while ago," Kent cut in. .
"Yes; I know. But there is more to
r fellow. The stock-smashing plan was
t all right, but it is proving too slow.
r Now they are going to do something
â¢ else."
I "Can you give it a name?" asked
r Kent, nerving himself. ."
"I- can. But first tell, me one ; thing;

jfo \ enough. "What is your bid?" <
\^S Bucks made it promptly. 1
"Ten thousand dollars; and you J
promise to leave the i-tate and stay
away for one year from the first Tues
day in November next."
"That is. until after the next State
election." Kent blew a whiff of smoke
to Â«he celling and shook his head ,
slowly. * # It is not enough." .. ,
The Covernor uncrossed his legs ,
crvued them the other way. and said: ,
â¢"I'll make it twenty thousand and ,
nvo ;ears." j
* Or thirty thousand and three years," i
Kent sussested amiably. "Or suppose
v.c come at once to the end of that ,
t:r>.s and say one hundred thousand ,
i-r.d ten years. . That would still leave ,
you a. fair prjoe for your block of su- .
tmrtÂ»B property in Guilford and j
Kay.k's addition to the city of Gaston, ,
wouldn't it?" , ]
The Governor set his massive jaw i
with a sharp little click of the teeth. i
"You are Joying on the edge of your
grave, my young friend. I taught you i
in Gaston that you were not big enough i
to fight me; do you think you are big ;
enough now?" â¢ 1
"1 don't think; I know," said Kent,
incisively. "And since you have re
ferred to the Gaston d^ys, let me ask i
if I ever gave you any reason to believe
that I could be scared out?" i
"Keep to the point." retorted Bucks,
harshly. "This State isn't broad enough
to hold you and me on opposite sides
of the fence. I could make it too hot
to hold you without' mixing up in it ;
myself, but I choose to fight my own â¢
battles. Will you take twenty thou- Â«
sand dollars sport cash and MacFar- Â¦
lane's job as circuit judge when I'm â¢
through with him?. Yea or no." t
"No." ;;
"Then what will you take?" Â¦
"Without committing myself in any ,
sense, I might say that you are getting
off too , cheaply on your most liberal
proposition. You and your friends
have looted a seventy-million-dollar
railroad, andâ"
"You might have stood in on that if
you had taken Guilford'a offer," was
the brusk rejoinder. "There was more
than a corporation lawyer's salary in
sight, if you'd had sense enough to
see it."
"Possibly. But I stayed outâ and I
am still out."
"Do you want to get in? -Is that your
price?"
"I intend to get Inâ though not, per
haps, In the way you have in mind..
Are you really to recall Judge Mac-
Farlane with instructions to give us
our hearing on the merits?"
The Governor's face was wooden
when he said: Â¦
"Is that all you want? I understand
MacFarlane is returning, and you will
doubtless .have your hearing In due
season."
"Not unless you authorize it," Kent
objected.
"And if I do? If I say that I have
already done bo, will you come in and
lay down your arms?"
"Xo."
"Then I'm through. Give me your key
and write me an order on the Security
Bank for those papers you are holding-"
"No," said Kent, again.
"I say yes!" came the explosive re
asiertion; and Kent found himself
looking down the bright barrel of a,
pistol thrust into his face across the
table. . Vv J -<f, :.:'"-"â¢*
For a man who had been oftenest
an onlooker on the football half of
life. Kent was measurably quick and
resourceful. In one motion he clamped
the weapon and turned it aside; in an
other lie jammed the fire end of his
cigar among the fingers of the grasp
ing hand. The Governor Jerked free
with an oath, pain-extorted; and Kent
dropped the captured weapon into the
table drawer. It was all done in two
breaths, and wh*n it .was over, . Kent
flung away the broken cigar and light
ed afresh one. m ,' Â¦
'/That was a very primitive expedi
ent, your Excellency, to say the best of
it," he remarked. "Have you nothing
better to ofter?"
The reply, was a wild-beast growl,
and taking it for a negative, ; Kent
went on.
'Then perhaps you will listen to my
proposal. The papers you are so anx
ious about are here," â tapping the en
velope on the table, 'j "No, .don't try
to snatch them; you wouldn't get out
of here alive with them, lacking my
leave. Snch of them as relate to your
complicity in the Universal Oil deal
are yours â on one condition;. that your
health fails and you get yourself or
dered out of the State for the remain

"No!** thundered the Governor.
"Very well; you may stay and take
a course of home treatment, if "you
prefer. It's optional." . Â¦
"By God! I don't know what keeps
me from throttling you with my
hands!" Bucks got upon his feet, and
Kent rose, also, slipping the box en
velope into his pocket and laying, a
precautionary hand on the drawer
â¢ pull. . . ' .
The Governor- turned away and
walked to the â¢ window, nursing his
burned fingers. , When he faced about
it was to return to the charge.
Â¦ "Kent, what Is It you want? Say it
in two words.*'
"Carididly..I didn't know, until a few
minutes ago. Governor. It began with
a determination to break your grip on
my railroad, I believe."
"You can have sour railroad, if you'
can set It â and be damned to it, and,
, to you. too!" :"'
"I ssid it began that way. My sole
idea In gathering " up - this evidence
against you and your accomplices was
to whittle out a club .that would make'

filled quickly with the swift shock of
gratitude.*
"If you had made a study of woman
kind through ten lifetimes instead of
a part of one, you could not know when
and hpw to strike truer and deeper,"
she said; and then, softly: "-"Why can't
you make me iove you. Brookes?"
He took his foot from the brake
pedal, and for ten seconds the released
car shot down the slope * unhindered.
Then he checked the speed and an
swered her. ;
"A little while ago I should have said
I didn't know; but now I do know*- It ,
is because you love David Kent: you
loved him before I had my. chance."
She did not deny the principal fact,
but she gave him his opportunity to
set it aside if he couldâ and would. /
"Call it foolish, romantic sentiment,
if you like. Is there no way to shame
me out of it?"
He shook his head slowly.
"You don't mean that."
"But if I say that I do; if I insist
that I am willing to be shamed- out of
it."
His smile was that of a brother' who
remembers tardily to be loving-kind.
"I shall leave that task for some one
who cares less for you and for your
true happiness than I do, or ever shall.
And it will be a mighty, thankless ser
vice that that 'some one' will render
you."
"But I ought to be whipped and
sent to bed,", she protested, almost
tearfully. 'Do you know what I have
done?â how I have â "
She could not oulte put it in words,
even for him, and he helped her gener
ously, as before.
"I know. -what Kent hasn't done;
which ia more to the point. But he
will do It fast enough if you will give
him half a chance."
"No." she said definitively.
"I say yes. One thing, and one thing
only, has kept him from telling you
any time since last autumn: that is a
sort of finical loyalty to me. I Saw how
matters stood when he came aboard of
our train at Gastonâ I am asking you
to believe that I didn't know it before â
and I saw then that my only hope
was to make a handfast friend of him.
And I did it."'
"I believe you can do anything you
try to do," she said warmly.
This time his smile was a mare
grimace.
"'You will have to make one exception '
after this,- and so shall I. And since it
is the first of any consequence in all
rcy mounting years, it grinds. I can't
throw another man out of the window
and ta!i*Â» h!s place." .
"If you were anything but what you
are, you would have thrown him out of
the window another way," she rejeiaed.
"That would have a dago's trick; not
a white man's," he asserted. "I suu
pope "i might have got in his way and
played the dog in the martger generally,
and you would have stuck to your
promise and married me, but I am not
looking for that kind of a winning. I
don't mind confessing that I played ray
last card when I released you from
your engagement. I said to myself:
If that doesn't break down the bar
riers nothing will."
.She looked up quickly.
"You will never know how near it
came to doing it, Brookes."
"But it d'dn't quite?"
The brother-smile came again.
"Let's paste that leaf down and turn
the other; the one that i haa David
Kent's name written at the top. tie 13
going to succeed all around. Elinor, and
1 am going to help him â for his sake
as 'well as yours."
"No v " she dissented. "He Is ccins
to fail; and I am to blame fornt."
He looked at her eidewise.
"So you were at the bottom of that,
were you? I thought , as much. . and
tried to make him admit it. but he'
wouldn't. What was your reason 7 **".
"I gave, it to him; I can't'glve ltta
yÂ° u -" ':? .. .â¢â¢- â¢ -; : -'^;' .- Â¦Â¦Â¦'.- \L*~*~ : t
"I guess 'Â¦' not,"* he laughed^ ." : "I was f 
not born on the right side of the Berk-
shire Hills to appreciate it. But really,
you mustn't interfere. ' As I. say.. 1 we
are going to make something out of
David; and a little conscience â of the
right old Pilgrim Fathers' brandâ Eoes"
a long ways in politics."
"But you promised me you were not
going to spoil him â only it doesn't mat
ter; you can't."
Ormsby chuckled openly, and when
she questioned "What?" he said:
"I was just wondering what you
would say if you knew what he is into
now; if you could guess, for instance,
that his backers have put up a cool
hundred thousand to be used as he
sees fit?"
"Oh!" she exclaimed; and there was
dismay and sharp disappointment in
her voice. "You don't mean that he is
gcing to bribe these men?"
"No," he said, relenting. "As a mat
ter of fact, I don't know precisely what
he is doing with the money, . but I
guess it is finding its way into legiti
mate channels. I'll make him give me
an itemized expense account for your
benefit when it's all over, if you like"
"It would be kinder to tell me more
about it now," she pleaded.
"No; I'll let him have that pleasure,
after the fact â if we can get him par
dened out before you go back East."
She was silent so long that he stole
another sidewise look between his
snubbings of the brake-pedal. Her face
was white and still, like the face of one
suddenly frost-smitten, and he was in
stantly self- reproachful.
"Don't look that way," he begged.
'It hurts me; makes me feel how heavy
my hand Is when - I'm doing my best
to make if light. He is trying a rather
desperate experiment, to be sure, but
he " is In, no Immediate personal dan
ger. I believe it or I shouldn't be here;
I should be with him." /
She asked no more questions, being
unwilling to tempt him to break con
fidence with Kent. But she was
thinking of all 'the desperate things a
determined man with temperamental
unbalancings might do when the tout
ing car rolled noiselessly, down the final
hill into the single street of Megilp.
There was but one vehicle in the
street at the moment; a freighter's ore
wagon drawn by a team of mules,
meekest and most shambling-prosaic
of their tribe. The motor-car was,
running on the spent velocity,, of .the
descent, and Ormsby thought to edge
past without stopping. But at the
critical Instant the mules gave way to
terror, snatched the "Jieavy .wagon into
the opposite plank walk, and tried ' to
climb a near-by telephone pole. ' Orms
by put his foot on the brake and some
thing snapped under, the car. \
"What was that T' Elinor asked; and
Ormsby ; got . down ; to investigate. .
"It Is our ' brake ' connection," he an
nounced, after a brief inspection.; "And

But there was a hitch in .the lower

had killed the farmer. Durgan climbed
to the cab of the 1010 and the changed

was no other thing to do, and Durgan.
hurried back to the telegraph office to
play the messenger.
He was too long about it. Before he
got back Halkett waa under the cab
window of the. 1010, demanding to know
âwith many objurgationsâ why Calla
han had stopped in the middle of the
yards.
"Gtt a move on you!" "he shouted.
'.The express is right behind us. and
it'll run us down, you damned bos
trotter!"
Callahan's gauntleted hand shot up
to the thxottle. bar.
> "I'm lavin*. Misther Halkett.- *he
said mildly. "Will yez go back to the
car or ride wit* me?"
> The general superintendent took no
chance of catching the naught-seven's
"hand rails in the/ darkness, and he
whipped up into the cab at the first
sharp cough of the exhaust.
."I'll go back when you stop for your
orders." he said; but a shadowy figure
had leaped upon the- engine step a
scant half-second behind him. and Cal
lahan was stuffing the crumpled copy
of the order into the sweat-band of his
cap. The next instant the big - 1010
leaped forward like a blooded horse
under an unmerited cut of the whip,
slid past the yard limits telegraph
office and shot out upon the main Una
of the western division. /
"Sit down. Misther Halkett, an' make
yerself aisy!" yelled Callahan across
the cab. " 'Tls small use Jimmy
Shovcl'Il have for his box this night."
"Shut off. you Irish madman!" was
the shouted command. "Don't you see
you're on the wrong division?"
Callahan gave the throttle-bar on
other outward hitch, tipped his seat
and took a hammer from the tool box.
"I. know where I'm goln", an* that's
more thin you know, ye blandhander
in' divil! Up on that box wit* you, an*
kapc out av Jimmy Shovel's road, or
I'll be the death av yez! Climb, now!"
It waa at this moment that the tens-?
strain of suspense was broken in the
despatcher's room on the second floor,
â¢of the Union station. The telephone
skirled Joyously, and the train-master
snatched up the ear piece.
"What does he say?" asked Kent.
"It's all right. He says Callahan is
ont on the western division, -with
Tischer chasing him according to pro
gramme. Halkett's In the cab of the
1010 "with Patsy andâ hold onâ By
George! he says one of them jumped
the car as it was passing the limits
station!"
"Which one was it?" asked Kent;
and he- had to wait till the reply came
from Durban..
"It was Hawk, the right-of-way man.
He, broke and ran ; for the nearest
electric car line the minute he hit the
ground. Durgan says. Does he count?*'
"No,*" said Kent; but it Is always a
mistake to underrate an; enemy's cali
berâeven that of his small arms. -
OIATTER XXVni.
The Night of Alafpis. *
If Editor Hildreth had said nothing
ir. his evening edition about the Im
pending strike on the Transwestern. It
was not because public interest r was
waning. For a fortnight the news
papers in thÂ» territory tributary to the
road had been full of strike talk, and
Hillreth had said his say, deprecating
the threatened appeal to force as fear*
lessly as he condemned the mismanage
ment which was provoking it. - "
But it was Kent who was responsi
ble for the dearth of news on the eve
of the event. Early. in the morning o?
the last day of the month he .hart
sought out the editor and begged him
to close the columns of the Evening
Argus to strike news, no matter what
should come in during the 'course .of
the day.
"I can't go Into the reasons as deep
ly now as I hope to a little later." ha
had said, his secretive^ habit holding
good to the final fathom of the slip
ping nav;ser of events, "But you must
bear with me once more, and whatever
you hear between .now and "the time
you go to - press don't comment on it.
I have one more chance to win out, anÂ«i
it hangs in a balance that a
feather's weight might tip the wronj;
way. I'll be with you between 10
and 12 to-night, and you can
safely save two columns of the morn
ing paper for the sensation I'm goins
to give you.""*
It was in fulfillment of this promise
that Kent bestirred himself after hÂ«
had sent a wire to" Ormsby. and M'Tosh
had settled down to the task of
smoothing Callahan's way westward
over a division already twitching in the
preliminary rigor of the strike convul- â¢
slon.
"I am going. to set the fuse for the
newspaper explosion," he said to his
ally. "Barring accidents, there Is no
reason why we shouldn't begin to fig
ure definitely upon the result, is
there?" .."
M*Tosh was leaning over Despatcher
Donohue's shoulder. He had slipped
Donohue's fingers aside from the key
to cut in with a peremptory "G. S." or-^
der suspending. In favor of the fast
mail, the rule which requires a station
operator to drop his board on a follow
ing section that Is less than ten min
utes behind Its file leader.
"The fun /is beginning." said thÂ«
train-master. "Tischer has his "tip
from Durgan to keep Callahan's tail
lights in sight. With the mail treading
on their heels the gentlemen in thÂ»
naught-seven will.be chary about pull
ing Patsy down too suddenly in mid
career. They have just passed Morning
Dew. and the operator, reports Tischer -
for disregarding his slow signal."
, "Can't you fix that?" asked Kent.
"Oh, yes; that is one of the things I
can fix. But there are going to ba
plenty of others.'*.
"Still we must take something for
granted. Mr. M'Tosh. 'What I have to
do .uptown won't wait until Callahan
has finished his rut!: I Â¦ thought the
main difficulty was safely overcome." '
. "Umph!" said the train-master; VthÂ©
troubles are . barely ' getting themselves
born. You must remember .that- we -
swapped horses at the last minute. Wa
were ready for the race to the east.
Everybody en the prairie division had
been notified that a special was to go
through to-night without stop from
Lesterville to A. & T. Junction."
"Well?"

: Kent went his .way dubiously reflec
tive. In the moment of triumph, when
Durgan' had announced the success bt
tne bold, change An the programme, he'
had made light of Hawk's escape. But
'now he saw possibilities. .True, tat

to humanity than the woman who had
forgotten how to cry.
But into the turmoil of thoughts half
indignant, half self-ccmpasaionate,
came reproach and a great wave of
tenderness filial. She saw. as with a
sudden gift of retrospection, her moth
er's long battle. with inadequacy, ar.d
how it aged her; caw, too, that the
battle had been fought unselfishly,
since Ehe knew her mother's declara-.
tion that she could contentedly "go
back to- nothing" was no "mere petu
lant boast. It was for her daughters
that Ehe hed jrown thin and haggard
and Irritable u-.:<!cr the p*rÂ«istent re
verses of* fortune; It was for them
that ehe was sinking the Grirakie in
dependence In the match-making
mother.
The tears in Elinor's eres were not
altos-ether of self-pity when she put
her back to the window. OrmsSy was
coming up the curved driveway In his
automobile, and Ehe had seen him but
dimly through the rising mist of emo
tluu. â
"Have you set your heart upon this
thing, mother? â but I know you have.
And 1 â I have tried as I could to be
Just and reasonable: to you and Pe
nelope, and to Brookes Ormsby. He is
nobleness itself; It Is a shame to give
him the shadow when he so richly de
serves the substance."
She spoke rapidly, almost incoher
ently; and the mother-love in the
woman who was careful and troubled
about the things that perish put the
matchmaker to the walL It was al
most terrifying to see Elinor, the
strong-hearted, the self-contained,
breaking down like other mothers'
daughters. So it was the mother who
heid out her arms, and the daughter
ran to go down on her knees at the
cl!air-side, burying her face in the lap
of comforting.
"There, there, Ellie. child; don't cry-
It's terrible to hear you sob like that."
she protested, her own voice shading in
sympathy. "I have been thinking only
of you and your future, and fearing
weakly that you couldn't bear the hard
things. But we':i bear them togetherâ
we three; and I'll never say another
"word about Brookes Ormsby and what
might have been."
*O mother! you are making it harder
than ever, now," was the tearful re
joinder. "Iâ there Is no reason why I
should be so obstinate. I haven't even
the one poor excuse you are making for
xne down deep "In your heart."
"David Kent?" said the mother.
The bowed head nodded a wordless
assent.
"I Ehan't say that I haven't suspect
ed him ail a!ong. dear. I am .afraid I
have. I have nothing against lilm. But
he is a poor man, Elinor; and we are
pocr. too. Yo;.'d be miserably unhap
py."
"If he stays poor, it is I who am to
blame" â this most contritely. "He had
a future before him; the open door was
his winning in the railroad fight, and I
closed it agalnct him."
"You?" said the mother, astonished.
"Yes. I told him he couldn't go on in
the way he meant to. I made it a mat
ter of conscience: add he â be has turn
ed back when he might have fought it
out and made a name for himself, and
paved us alL And it was such a hair
splitting thing! All the world would
have applauded him if he had gone on;
and there was only one woman in all
the *Â»vorld to pry into the secret places
of his soul and stir up the sleeping
doubt!** - * ,."Â¦
Now, if all the thrifty gear-getting
"facultj'" of the dead and gone Grim
kie5 had become thin and diluted and
inefficient In this Mrs. Hepzibah. last
of the name, the strong wine and iron
of the blood of righteousness had come
down to her unstrained.
"Tell me all about it. daughter," she
adjured; and when the tale was told,
she patted the bowed head tender!**
and spoke the words of healing.
"You did altogether right. Ellie, dear;
Iâ I am proud of you. daughter. And
if. rjs yc-u say. you were the only one to
do it. that doesn't matter; it was all
the more necessary. Are you sure he
gave it up?"
Elinor rose and stood with clasped
hands beside her mother's chair; a very
pitiful and stricken half-sister of the
self-reliant, dependable young woman
who had boasted herself the head of.
the household.
"I have jio means of knowing what
he has done." Ehe said slowly, "But I
know the man. He has turned back."
There was a tap at the door and a
servant was come to say that Mr.
Brookes Ormsby was waiting with his
auto-car. Was Miss Brentwood nearly
ready?
Elinor said ."In a minute," and when
the door closed she made a confidante
of her mother for the first time since
her childhood days.
"I know what you have suspected
ever since that summer in New Hamp
shire, and It is true." she confessed. "I
do love himâ as much as I dare to
Â¦without knowing whether he cares for
me. Must I â may I â say yes to Brookes
Ormsby without telling him the whole
truth?"
"Oh, my dear! You couldn't do that!"
was the quick reply.
"You mean that J. am not strong
enough? But I am, and Mr. Ormsby is
manly enough and generous enough to
meet me half-way. Is there any other
honest thing to do, mother?"
Mrs. Hepzibah shook her head de
liberately and determinedly, though'she
knew she was shaking the Ormsby
millions into the abyss of the unattain
able.
"No; It is his Just due. But I can't
help being sorry for him, Ellie. What
â¢will you do If he says it doesn't make
any difference?"
The blue-gray eyes were downcast.
*"I don't know. Having asked eo
much and accepted so much from him
â !t shall be as he says, mother."
* The afternoon had been all that a
cummer afternoon on the brown high
lands can "be, and the -powerful tour-
Ing car had swept them from mile to
mile over the dun hills like an earth-
Bklmmlng dragon whose wing-beat
was the muffled, explosive thud of tne
motor.
Through mast of the miles Elinor had
given herself up to silent enjoyment of
the-, rapture of swift motion, and Orms
by "had respected her mood, as he al
ways did. But when they were on the
high hills beyond the mininR camn, of
Megilp and he had thrown the engines
cut of sear to brake the car gently
down the long Inclines, there was room
Tor speech.
"This !s oat last spin together on the
high plains, I suppose," he said. "Xour

our return- to town, hasn't she?"
Elinor confirmed it half absently. She
Ttad'becn ktyed up to face the _- In

she was afraid now that he was going

the fw/irmonplaces.

"But you have not been entirely

of assent; pome such signal of ac

have given the waiting headsman.
"You have been afraid every day

Ehe could not thrust and parry with

She understood him, and her eyes
the lengthening perspective as the east
bound train shot away from "Agua

"What, was the* trouble that day?"
he asked, putting in a question on his
side. _ ... Â¦-Â¦â¢Â¦Â¦

and 'when ', the \ train-master ; was : gone,

he did two or three things which, toan
Initiated onlooker, might \ have seemed

; that it .would ; leak slowly but - surely

'Then he got a hammer and sledge out

crippled the points of the l hooks with

'private car when his . work was done.
-'Ye'llride this night where Patsy Cal
lahan dhrives, > an' be / dommed to ye."
Meanwhile,., the train-master had
reached the iron grille at the other end
of the long track platform. At a small
wicket used by* the" station employes
and trainmen,' Kent was waiting for
at train', time, had disappeared again. -
It was a standing mystery to the
train-master, and '; to â¢ the rank and file,
why Receiver Guilford had elected -to
ignore, the fact that; he was within
three hours of a strike which promised
to Â¦ : include , at least I our r flf ths o f his .
' operatives ; had taken "no . steps f or de
i f ense, i; and" had - not '. confided, as it Â¦ ap
'peared.Un the members of his own offl
cial staff." '',!-Â¦
But Kent was at no loss to account
for Â¦ the official silence. If the secret
could, be kept for a few hours longer,
the Junta would unload Jhe Transwes
tern. strike, tie-up and general demor
alization, upon an unsuspecting Over
land management.
f None the less, there were other, things
unexplainable even to Kent; for one,
this night flitting to Gaston to put the
finishing touches on an edifice of fraud
which had been builded shamelessly in
the light of day. >
Kent had not the key to unlock this
door. of mystery; but here the master
spirit of the Junta was doing, not
what he would, but what he could.
The negotiations for the lease had con
sumed much time at a crisis when time
was precious, â¢ Judge MacFarlane had
to be recalled and once more bullied in
to subjection; and Falkland, acting for
, the Plantagould , interest, had Insisted
upon some formal compliance with the
"letter of the law.
Bucks had' striven masterfully to
"drive and not be driven; but the delays
were inexorable, and ' }he Impending
strike threatened to turn the orderly
charge into a rout. The Governor had
postponed the coup from day to day,
waiting upon the leisurely movements
of Falkland; and at the end of the ends
there remained but three hours of the
final day of grace when the telegram
came' from Falkland with, the welcome
news that the Overland officials were
on their way from Midland City to
keep the appointment in Gaston.
Of all this Kent knew nothing, and
Â¦^as anxious In Just proportion as the
minutes elapsed and the time for the
departure of the east-bound express
drew near. For the success of the des
perate venture turned upon this: that v
the receiver's special must leave ahead
of the passenger train. "With the ex
press blocking the way the difficulties
became insurmountable.-
Kent was still standing at the train
men's wicket when Callahan sent the
private car gently up to the trackhead
of track eight. M'Tosh had been tele
phoning again, and the receiver and his
party were on the way to the station.
"I was afraid you'd have to let the
express go first," said Kent, when the
train-master came his way again.
"How much time have we?" ,
"Five minutes more; and they are on
the way down â there they come."
Kent'looked and saw a group. of six â¢
men making for the nearest exitNin the
grille. Then he smote his fist into his
palm. '
"Damn!" he muttered; "they've got
the vice president of the Overland with
them! That "a bad."
"It's bad for Mr. Callafield," growled
M'Tosh. "We're in too deep now to
back down on his account."
Kent moved nearer and stood in the
shadow of the gate-keeper's box. leav
ing M.'Tosh, who was on the track plat
form, free to show himself. From his
new point of espial_Kent checked off
the members of the party. When Ma
jor Guilford left It to come back for a
word with M'Tosh. there were live
others; the Governor, his private sec
retary, Hawk,_Halkett, the general su
perintendent, "and the Overland's vice
president.'
"All ready, M'Tosh?" said the re
ceiver.
"Koady and waiting. Major," was the
bland reply. â¢ â¢ *
"Who is" our engineer?"
"Patrick Callahan." .
"That wild Irishman? The Governor
eays he'd as soon ride behind the de
viL" .*"."Â¦Â¦ .
"Callahan will get you there,'! said
the train-master, with deliberate em-,
phasis. Then he asked a question of
his own. "Is Mr. Callafield going with
you?"
"No. -He came down to see us off.
How is the fast mail to-night?"
Â¦JShe's Just Inâ an hour and thirty
five minutes late."
The major swore pathetically. He
â¢was of the generation of railway offl
-cials, happily fast passing, which
cursed and swore itself into authority.
"That's anather $300 forfeit to the
Postoffice Department! Who's taking it
west?" ~'-'";v -
"Tischer."
"Give him orders to cut out all the
stops. If he is more than fifty-five min
utes late at Bighorn he can come in
and get his time."
Tischer had Just got the word to go,
and was pulling out on the yard main
line.
"I'll catch him with the wire at yard
limits," said M'Tosh. Then: "Would
you mind hurrying your people a little,
major? The express is due to leave."
Guilford was a heavy man for his
weight, and he waddled back to the
others, waving his arms as a signal for
them to board the car.
Kent saw the vice president of the
Overland Short Line shake hands with
' Bucks and take his leave, and was so
intent upon watching the tableau of
â¢ departure that he failed to notice the
small boy; in 'Western Union blue who
was trying to thrust a telegram, damp
from the copying rolls, into his hand.
"It's a rush, sir," said the boy, pant
ing from his quick dash across the
track platforms.
It was Ormsby's message from
Breezeland; and while Kent was try
ing to grasp the tremendous import of
it. M'Tosh was giving Caliahan the
signal to go. Kent sprang past the
gate-keeper and gave the square of
damp paper to the train-master.
"My God! read that!" he gasped,
'with a dry sob of excitement. "It was
our chanceâ one chance In a million â
and we've lost it!" '
M'Tosh was a man for a crisis. The
red tail lights of the private car special
were yet within a sprinter's dash of the
trackhead, but the train-master lost
no time chasing a ten-wheel -flyer with
"Red" Callahan at the throttle. Â¦
"Up to my office!" he shouted; and
ten â¢> seconds 'later : Kent was leaning
â¢ breathless over the desk in the de
spatcher's room while M'Tosh called
Durgan over the yard limits telephone.
"Is that you, -Durgan?" he asked,
when the "reply came.". Then: "Drop
the board on the mail, quick! and send
somebody to tell Tischer, to, side track,

I'm telling it to you," Kent asserted
confidently.* "And' when you get .the
epilogue you will say that 1 It makes my
little preface wearisome by contrast."
The light was slowly drawing in the
editorial mind. r â¢
"My heaven!" he exclaimed.' "Kent.'
you're good â¢ for twenty years at the
very lul-least!" tj./
"Am I? It occurs" to me that 'the
Prosecuting Attorney in the case will
have a hard time proving anything.
Doesn't It look that way to you? At
the worst. It is only an unhappy mis-'
understanding of orders. And if the
end should happen to Justify the
meansâ" ' ; â¢ :,V
Hildreth shook his head gravely.
"You don't understand, David. ;: If
you could be sure of a fair-minded
Judge and an unbiased Juryâ you and
those who are Implicated with you; but
you'll get neither in this rriachlne-rid
den State." ,
"We are going to have both after you
have filled your two columnsâ by the
way, you are still saving those two
columns for me, aren't you? â In to
morrow, morning's Argus. Or rather,
I'm hoping there will be no need ;for
either Judge or Jury." '.. . .
The night editor shook his head again
and once more he said, "My heavenl"
adding: "What could you possibly hope
to accomplish? You'll get the receiver
and his big boss out of the State for a
few minutes, or possibly for a few
hours, if your strike makes them hunt
up another railroad to return on. But
what will it amount to? Getting rid of
the receiver doesn't annul the
of the court. 11^
Kent fell back on his secretive habit
yet once again.
"I don't care to anticipate the cli
max, Hildreth.' By 1 o'clock one of
two things will have happened: You'll
tet a wire that will make your back
hair sit up, or I'll get one that will
make me wish I'd never been born.
Let it rest at that for tne present; you
have work enough on hand to fill up
the interval and if you haven't, you
can' distribute those affidavits -I gave
you among the compositors and get
them into type. I want to, see them in
the paper to-morrow morning along
with the other news."
"Oh, we can't do that, David! The
time isn't ripe. You know what I told
you about â "
"If the time doesn't ripen to-night,
Hildreth, it never will. Do as I tell
you and get that stuff Into type. Do
more; write the hottest editorial you
can think of, demanding to know if it
isn't time Â«for the people to rise and
clean out this stable once for all."
"By Jove! David, I've half a mum
mind to do it. If you'd only unbutton
yourself a little and let me see what
my backing is going to be â "
"All in good season." laughed Kent
"Your business for the present moment
is to write; I'm going down to' the
Union station." ,
"What for?" demanded the editor.
"To see If our crazy engineer Is still
mistaking his orders properly."
"Hold on a minute. How did the
enemy get wind of your plot so quick
ly? You can tell me that, can't you?"
"Oh, j r es; I told you Hawk was one
of the party in the private car. He
fell off at the yard limits station and
came back to town:"
The night, editor stood, up and con
fronted his visitor- " -Â¦ - -
"David, you are 'either ' the coolest
"plunger that ever drew breath-*â or the
bub-biggest fool. I wouldn't be stand
ing in your shoes to-nignt for. two such
railroads as the T-W." .' - '
. Kent laughed again and opened the
door.
"I suppose not. But you know there
is no accounting for the difference in
tastes. I feel aÂ§ if I had never really
lived before this night; the only thing
that troubles me is the fear that some
body or somethings-will get in. the way
of my demented engineer.Y
He went out into the hall, but as
Hildreth was closing the door he
turned back. â¢ ) '
"There Is one thing that I meant to
say: When you get your two columns
of sensation, you've got : to be decent
and share with the Associated Press."
"I'm dud-dashed, if I do!" said Hil
dreth, fiercely.
"Oh, yes, you will; just the bare facts,
you know. You'll, have all the excit
ing details for an 'exclusive,' to say
nothing of the batch of affidavits in the
oil scandal. And it is of the last im
portance to me that the facts Bhall be
known to-morrow morning wherever
the Associated has a wire." '
"Go way," said the editor, "and dud
don't come back here till you can un
cork yourself like a man and a Cue-
Christian! Go off. I say!"
It wanted but a few minutes of 11
when Kent mounted the stair to the
dispatcher's room- in , the Union
station. He found ' M'Tosh Bitting
at Donohue's elbow, and the sound
ers on the glass-topped table were
crackling, like over-laden- -wirea in
an electric storm.
"Strike talk," said the trainmaster.
"Every man on both divisions wants to
knojv what's doing. Got your news
paper string tied up all right?"
Kent made a sign of assent.
"We are waiting for Mr. Patrick Cal
lahan. Any news from him?"
"Plenty of it Patsy would have a
6tory to tell, all right, If he could stop
to put it on the wires. Durgan ought
to have caught that blamed right-of
way man and chloroformed him."'
"I found him messing, as I 'phoned
you. Anything come of it?" , â¢ .
"Nothing fatal, I guess, since Patsy
is still . humping along. . But Hawk's
next biff was more to the purpose. He
came down here, with Halkett's chief
clerk, whom he had hauled out of bed."
and two policemen. The plan; was to
fireDonohue and me, and put Bicknell
in charge. , It might have ' worked I if
Bicknell'd had the sand. But he weak
en ed at . the last minute ; admitted . that
he wasn't big enough to handle the dis
patcher's trick. The way Hawk cursed
him out was a caution, to sinners." '.
"When was this?" - Kent asked.
"Just a few minutes ago. Hawk went
off ripping; swore he. would find some
body ; v who wasn't afraid to take" the
wiresi' And. between us : .three," I'm
scared stiff for fear he will." â¢
"Can it be> done?" " ; \ .
"Dead ; easy, if "he knows how I to go
about itâ and ~ Bicknell will tell ? him."
The Overland people don't ' love , us : any
too '.well, 'and if they .'did the lease deal
would make "them side Â¦' with Guilford
: and the Governor." ,, If .Hawk asks them
to lend him a train dispatcher for a few
minutes they'll do it."' "Â¦*.-Â¦

for weapons, the ring controlled the
police power of the State and of the
city. Let the word be passed that the
employes of the Transwestern were
kidnaping their receiver and the Gov
ernor, and many things might happen
before "Red" Callahan should finish his
long race to the westward. *
Thinking of these things, David Kent
walked uptown when he might have
taken a car. When the toxin" of panic
I? in the air there is no antidote like
vigorous action.
Passing the Western Union central
office he stopped to send Ormsby a sec
ond telegram, reporting progress and
asking him to be present in* person at
the denouement to put the facts on the
wire at the earliest possible instant of
time. "Everything depends upon this,"
he added, when he had made the mes
sage otherwise emphatic; "If we miss
the morning papers we are done."
While he was pbeketing his change
at the receiving clerk's pigeon-hole, a
cab rattled up with a horse at a gallop,
and Stephen Hawk sprang out. Kent
saw him through the plate-glass front
and turned quickly to the public writ
ing-desk, hoping to be overlooked. He
was. For once In a way the ex-dls
trlct attorney was too nearly rattled to
be fully alert to \ his surroundings,
desk; and Hawk wrote his message,
after two or three false starts, almost
at Kent's elbow.
Kent heard the clink of coin and the
low-spoken urgings for haste at the
receiving clerk's window; but he for
bore to move until the cab had rattled
away. Then he gathered up the spoiled
blanks left behind by Hawk and
smoothed them out. Two of them bore
nothing but the date line, made illegi
ble, it would 6eem, by the writer's
haste and nervousness. But at the
third attempt Hawk had got as far as
the address: "To all, Transwestern
agents on Western "Division."
Kent stepped quickly to the re
ceiver's window. The only expedient
he could think of was open to re
proach, but It jvas no time to be over
scrupulous.
"Pardon me," ha began, "but didn't
the gentleman who was Just here for
get to sign his message?"
The little hook caught its minnow.
The receiving clerk was folding Hawk's
message- to place it In the leather car
rier of the pneumatic tube, but he
opened and examined it.
"No," he said; "it's signed all right;
'J. B. Halkett. G. S.' "
"Ah!" said Kent. "That's a little
odd. Mr. Halkett is out of town, and
this gentleman, Mr. Hawk, is not in his
department. I believe I should investi
gate a little before sending that, if I
were you."
Having thus sown the Email seed of
suspicion, which, by the by, fell on
barren 6Oil, Kent lost no time in calling
up M'ToFh over the nearest telephone.
"Do our agents, on the western divi
sion handle Western Union business?"
he asked. .
The reply came promptly.
"i*cs; locally. The W. U. has an in
dependent line to Breezeland Inn and
points beyond."
. "Well, our right-of-way man has Just
sent a telegram to all agents, signing
Halkett's name. I don't know what he
said in it, but you can figure that out
for yourself." â
"You bet I can!" was the emphatic
rejoinder. And then: "Where are you
now?" . , . i' '. '.'Â¦ . :'
"I'm at the Clarendon public 'phone,
but I am going over to the Argus office.
I'll let you know when I leave there.
Good-by." . .' ,',, -'j . . ;
When Kent reached the night edi
tor's den on the third floor of the Ar
gus building he found Hlldreth im
mersed chin-deep in a sea of work. But
he quickly extricated himself and
cleared a chair for his visitor.
"Praise be!" he ejaculated. "I was
beginning to get anxious. Large things
are happening, and you didn't turn up.
I've had Manville wiring all over town
for you."
. /'What are some of the large things?"
asked Kent, lighting his first cigar
since dinner.
."Well, for one; do you know that
your peoples, are on the verge of the
much- talked -of strike?"
/'Yes; I knew it this morning. That
was what I wanted you to suppress in
the evening edition."
.1 suppressed it all right; I didn't
know itâ day and date. I mean. They
kept It beautifully quiet. But that isn't
all. Something Is happening at the
capitol. I was over at the club a little
while ago and Hendricks was there.
Somebody sent In a note and he posi
tively ran to get out. When I came
back I sent Rogers over to Cassatti's
to see if he could find you. There was
a junta dinner confab on; Meigs, Sena
tor Crowley, three or four of the ring
; aldermen and half a dozen wa-ward
; politicians. Rogers has a nose for
' news, and when he had phoned me
you weren't there -he hung around on
the edges."
"Good men you have, Hildreth. What
did the unimpeachable Rogers see?"
5 "He saw on a large scale Just what
I had seen on a small one; somebody
pup-passed a note In. and when it had
gone the round of the dinner table
those fellows tumbled over each other
trying to get away."
"Is that all?" Kent inquired.
"No. Apart from his nose, Rogers is
gifted with horse sense. When the din
ner crowd boarded an uptown car our
man paid fare to the same conductor.
He wired me from the Hotel Bruns
wick a few minutes ago. ' There is
some sort of a caucus going on in Hen
dricks' office In the capitol and mum
messengers are flying in all directions."
"And you wanted me to come and
tell you all the whys and wherefores?"
Kent suggested. '
"I told the chief I'd bet a bub-blind
horse to a broken-down mule you could
do it if anybody could."
"All right; listen: Something worse
than an hour ago the Governor, , his
private secretary. Guilford, Hawk and
Halkett started out on a special train
to go to Gaston."
"What for?" InterrupTed the editor.
"To meet Judge MacFarlane, Mr.
Bemple Falkland and.the Overland offi
cials. You can guess what was to be
done."
"Sure. Your railroad was to be sold
out. lock, stock and barrel;, or. leased to
the Overland for , ninety-nine â¢ yearsâ
which amounts to the same thing."
"Precisely. Well, by some unaccount
able mishap the receiver's . special was
switched over to the western: division
at yard limits and the. engineer seems
to think he has orders to proceed west

doing. And the funny ', part of if is

Callahan. mandatory in its first form,

he was covered from the forward vesti

"He must have suspected something
and dropped off in the yard or at the
shops," said Halkett. /And at the say
ing of it he shrank back involuntarily
and added: "Ah!" Look at'' that, will
you?" â¢ ?
The, car had just thundered past an
other station and Callahan : had under
run one more stop signal at full speed.
At the .same instant .Tischer's head

. "What is that f qllowlng us ?" asked

"It's the fast mall," said Halkett-

gasped. 1 , '

"Then we ? can't stop '. unless some

But-'the 1 master, spirit *Â¦ of ,, the ; Junta
was 'still cool and collected.^i ' '
''This is no time to quarrel, ' he said.

do ,ybu say, Halkett?" '
"There is only one thing," replied the
superintendent; "we've got to make
tho Irishman run ahead fast enough
and far enough to give us room to stop
or take a siding." :
The Gpvernor planned It in a few
curt sentences. Was there a weapon
to be had? Danfprth; the, private sec
retary, roused from his nap â¢ in the
wicker chair.was able to produce a ser
viceable' revolver. * Two ; minutes , later,
the sleep still tingling in his nerves to
augment another tingling less pleasur
able, the secretary had spanned the
terrible gap. separating the car from
the engine and was making his way
over the coal,' fluttering his.handker
chief in token of his peaceful inten
tions. ' â¢â¢ ' - i
, "This Is pretty serious, Major. Have
you anything to suggest?" and without
waiting for a reply he. turned upon
Kalkett: "Where is Mr. Hawk?"
."I don't know. I supposed ha was
in' here with you. Or maybe he's out
on the rear platform."
The three of them went to tha rear,
passing ' the private secretary, comfor
tably asleep in his wicker chair. When
they stepped, out upon. the recessed ob

mauled, begrimed and breathless from
his late tussle with the twojenginemen,
was ' the first r intimation 6"f wrong-go
ing . that had : penetrated to the inner
sanctum of I the private car. :
"What's , that you say. Mr. Halkett ?
-Hin the western division? . Where
abouts?" demanded the Governor.:
"Between Lossing | and Skipjack sid
ingâif we. haven't passed the siding

been two of them.. It's a plot of some
kind and Callahan knows what he is
about. He had roe held up with a
hammer , till' Just c few minutes ago,
and he's running past stop signals and
over , red lights like a , madman ! "
'Bucks and Guilford exchanged con
victions by the road of the eye and the
Governor said: -
as the speed Is increased. He could
outpace the safeguarding mail, 1 save
water â and take : the chance of being .
shot , in the back ; from -; the : forward

Callahan thought once [ot the child
mothered by ; the Sisters. of Loretto in
tha convent at" the capital, shut his
eyes to ; that and to all things , extra
neous and sent the. 1010 about her
business. . At r the first reversed . curve
he hung out of his window,for a back
ward look. Tischer's headlight had
disappeared and : his protection .was
gone. . <=
On the rear platform of the private
car four men watched the threatening
second section fade into the night.
"Our man has thought better of it,"
said the Governor, marking the In
creased speed and' the disappearance
of the menacing headlight, j
Guilford'a sigh of relief was almost
a groan. . . Â¦ ... - /Â¦--.-;'
"My. God!" he said; "it makes mm
cold to think .what might happen if
Â¦he should pull us over into the other
State!'*
But Halkett was still smarting from
tha indignities put upon him and- his
comment was a vindictive threat.
"I'll send that .damned : Irishman
over ; the road for this, if it the last
thing I ever do!" he declared, and he
confirmed it with an oath.
But Callahan was getting his pun
ishment as he went along. - He had
scarcely settled the 1010 into her gait
for' the final run against the falling
water ' supply when another station
came in sight It was a small cattle
town ' and in addition to the swinging
red lights and a huge bonfire to il
luminate the yards the obstructionists
had torn down the loading corral and
were -piling the lumber on the track.
Once again Callahan's nerve flick
ered and he-' shut oft the steam. But
before it was too late he reflected that
the barrier. was meant only to scare
him into stopping. One minute later
the air was full of flying splinters and
the danger was passed. -But one of
the broken planks came through the
cab window, missing the engineer by
no more than a hnnd's breadth. And
the shower of 'splinters, sucked in by
the whirl of the train, broke' glass in
the private car and sprinkled the
quartet on the platform with split
kindling and wreckage.
"What was that?" gasped the re
ceiver. â¢ ; â¢ " t Â¦
Halkett pointed to the bonfire, re
ceding like a fading star in the rear
ward distance.
"Our friends are beginning to
throw stones, since clods 'won't stop,,
him," he said. â¢
Bucks shook his head. t
"If that Is the case we'll have to be
doing something on our own account.

. Halkett stepped into* the car and
pulled the cord of -the automatic air.
"No good," he muttered. "The
Irishman bled our tank before he
started. Help me at the hand brakes,
a couple of you." . v
Danforth > and. the Governor took
hold of the brake wheel with him, and
for n minute or two the terrible speed
slackened ; a' little. " Then some part
of the disused handgear gave way un
der the three-man- strain and that
hope,was. gone. . . ' . . . . .' i.

-Thte . SDace, in .the forward vestibule'
was narrow and cramped, and with
the strain of the dragging car to
make the Din stick tight it took two
of, them lying flat, waiting . for the
back-surging moment and wiggling it
for slack, to pull it. The coupling
dropped out of the hook and the en
gine shot ahead to the length or the
safety cnainsi thus far, but no far
ther. " â¢
Halkett stood up.
','It's i up to you, Danforth," he said,
raising his voice to be heard above the
pounding roar of the wheels. "You're
the youngest and lightest; get down on
the 1010's brake beam and unhook those
chains."
The secretary looked once into the
trap with the dodging Jaws and the
backward-flying bottom and declined
the honor. * /.
"I can't get down there," he cried.
"And I shouldn't know what to do if I
could." . â¢
Once more thÂ© superintendent exhib
ited his nerve. He had nothing at
stake save a desire to defeat Callahan:
but he had the persistent courage or
the bull terrier. With Bucks and tha
secretary to steady him he lowered
himself in the gap till he could stand
upon the brake beam of the 1010's ten
der and grope with one free hand for
thÂ« hook of the nearest safety chain.
Death nipped at him every time the en
gine gave or took up the slack of thÂ»
loose coupling, but he dodged ana hung
on until he had satisfied himself.
"It's no good," he announced, when
they had dragged him by main
strength back to a' footing in thÂ« nar
row vestibule. "ThÂ» hookÂ» are bent
into the links. We're due to go
wherever that damned Irishman Is
taking us.**
Shovel was firing, and tha trailing
smoke and cinders, quickly made thÂ«
forward vestibule untenable. When
jthey were driven in, Bucks and the re
ceiver went through to the rear plat
form, where they were presently
joined by Halkett and Danforth.
-I've been trying the air again." said
the superintendent, "but It's no go.
What's next?"
The Governor gave the "word.
"Walt," he said; and the four of
them clung to the hand-rails, swaying
and bending to the bounding lurches
ex' the flying car.
Mile after mile reels from beneath
the relentless wheels, and ' still the
speed increases. Station Donerall Is
passed, and now the pace is so furious
that the. watchers on the railed plat
form cannot make out the signals in
the. volleying wake of dust. Station
Schofield Is passed, and again the sig
nals, if any there be, are swiftly
drowned in the gray dust-smother.
From Schofleld to Agua. Callente is but
a scant ten miles; and as the flying
train rushes on toward the State
boundary, two faces in the quartet of
watchers show tense and drawn un
der the â¢ yellow light . of the Plntsch
platform lamp.*
The Governor swings himself un
steadily to the right-hand railing and
the long look ahead brings the twink
ling arc-star of the tower light on
Breezeland Inn into view. He turns
to Guilford, who has fallen limp Into
one of the platform chairs.
."In five minutes more we shall pass
Agua Callente," he says. "Will you
kill the Irishman, or shall I?" Gull
ford's lips move, but there is no audi
ble; reply; and Bucks takes Danforth's
weapon and passes quickly and alone
to the forward vestibule. - â¢

be your own fault."
"Arrest that" man!" said Hawk to
his policemen; but Kent interposed.
h "If you do the force will be two men

dead yet." And he took down the num

There were no arrests .made and
when the busted three were clear of the

anxious question.
"How near can they come to smash

"That depends on Callahan'n nerve.

CHAPTER XXIX.
The" Relentless' Wheels. '
But Engineer Callahan had no notion
of failing. When he had drawn. the
. hammer on his superior! officer, advis
ing discretion and a seat on, Jimmy
Shovel's box,;the. v 1010 was racking out
over the switches in the -western divi
sion yards. Three minutes later the
electric beam of ( .Â» Tischer's following
headlight sought 'and found the first
section on the ; long, tangent leading up
to the high plains and the race was in
full swing. , 'â¢ ;
At Morning Dew, the first night tele
graph station out of the capital, the
two sections were no more than a scant
quarter of a mile apart ; and the oper
ator tried to Hag the second section
down,- as reported.- This did . not hap
pen again until several stations had
been passed and Callahan set his jaw
and gave the 1010 more throttle. But at
Lossing, a town of some size, the board
was down-and a man ran out at the
crossing, swinging a red light.
Callahan .looked well to the switches,
with the".* steam shut off and his
hand dropping . instinctively to the air;
and the superintendent shrank, into his
corner and gripped the window, ledge
when the special roared past the warn
ing signals and on through the town
beyond. He had maintained. a â dazed
silence since j the I episode of the ' flour
ished hammer, but now he was moved
to yell across the cab: .,
VI suppose you know, what you're in
for, "if you live to get out of this! It's
twenty years," 1 in. this State, to-oass a
danger signal!" '.This , is not all that
the ; . superintendent ' said; j there" were
forewords and* interjections, " emphatic

Callahan's reply" was another flourish
of the hammer,- and a. sudden outDull

intendent subsided again.

. FJHELAN- BUILDinCmwatching the glass water-gage where
the water shows now only when the
engine lurches heavily to the left. He
knows that the crown -sheet of the lire,
box is bare, and that. any moment it
may give down and the end will come.
Yet his graiyitleted hand never falls
from the throttle bar to the air-cock,
and his eyes never leave the bubble
appearing and disappearing at longer
intervals in the heel of the water glass.
Shovel has stepped firing, and . Is
hanging out of his window for the
straining look ahead. Suddenly he
drops to the footplate to grip Calla
han's arm.
"See!" he says. "They have set the
switch to throw us in on the siding!"
In one motion the flutter of the ex
haust ceases, and the huge ten-wheeler
buckles to the sudden setting, of the
brakes. The man standing in the for
ward vestibule of the naught-seven
lowers his weapon. Apparently it is
not going to be necessary to kill the
engineer, after all.
But Callahan's nerve has failed him
only for the moment. There is one
chance in ten thousand that the
circumambulating side track is empty:
one and one only, and no way to make
sure of it. Beyond the station, as Calla
han well knows, the siding comes again
into the main line and the switch is a
straight-line "safety." .Once again the
thought of his motherless child flickers
Into the engineer's brain; then he re
leases the air and' throws his weight
backward upon the throttle bar. ' Twp
gasps and a heart-beat decide it, and
before the man in the vestibule can
level his weapon and fire the one-car
train has shot around the station, heav
ing and lurching over the uneven rails
of the siding and grinding shrilly over
the points of the safety switch to race
on the down grade to Megilp.
At the mining camp the station is in
darkness save for the goggle eves of
an automobile drawn up beside the
platform, and deep silence reigns but
for the muffled, irregular thud of the
auto car's motor. But the beam of the
1010's headlight shows the small sta
tion building massed - by men, a score
of them poising for a spring to the
platforms of the private car when the
slackening speed shall permit.- A bul
let tears Into the woodwork at Calla
han's elbow and another breaks thÂ«
glass of the window beside him, but he
makes the stop as steadily as if death
were not snapping at turn from behind
and roaring in his ears from the belly
of the burned engine.
"Be doomping yer fire lively, now.
Jimmy, b'y," he says, dropping from
his box to help. And while they wrestle
with the dumping-bar, these two, the
poising figures have swarmed upon fne
naught-seven, and a voice is lifted
above the babel of others in sharp pro
test.
nor's private secretary."
"And were they all killed?"
A great light broke in upon Kent
when he saw how Marston had misap- .
prehended. Also, he saw how much
it would simplify matters if he should;
be happy enough to catch the ball in
the reactionary rebound.
"They are all alive and uninjured, to
the best of my knowledge and belief;
though I understand that one of them
narrowly escaped lynching at the
hands of an excited mob." \ ,
The long lean figure erected itself In
the chair, and the weight of years
seemed to slip from Its shoulders.
"But I understood you to say that the
duties of the executive had devolved
upon me, Mr. Kent. You .also said I
could imagine the result of this singu
lar mistaking of train orders,' and I
fancied I could. What was the result?"
"A conclusion not. quite as sangul-.
nary as that you had in mind, though
it Is likely to prove serious enough for.
one member of the party in .the private
car. The special train was chased all
the way across the State by the fast
mail. It finally outran the pursuing
section and was stopped at Megilp. A
sheriff's posse was in waiting, and an
arrest was 'made."
"Go on," said the Lieutenant Gover
nor.
"I must first go back a little. Some
weeks ago there was a shooting affray
in the mining-camp, arising out of a
dispute over a 'salted' mine, and a man
was killed. The murderer escaped
across the State line. Since the au
thorities of the State in which the
crime was committed had every reason
to believe that a Governor's requisition
for this particular criminal would not
be honored, two courses were open to
them; to publish the facts and let the
moral sentiment of the neighboring
commonwealth punish the criminal- as
it could, or would; or, suppressing the.
facts, to bide" their chance, Of catching
their man beyond the boundaries of the
State which gave him an asylum. They
chose the latter." â¢
A second time Marston left his chair
and began to pace the floor. After a
little he paused to say:
"This murderer is James Guilford, I
take it; and the Governorâ"
"No." said Kent, gravely. "The mur
derer isâ Jasper G. Bucks." He handed
the Judge a copy of the Argus. "You
will find it all in the press despatches;
all I have told you, and a great deal
more."
The Lieutenant Governor read the
newspaper story as he walked, lighting
the electric chandelier to enable him to
do Â£O. ,When it was finished he sat
down again. , '
"What a hideous cesspool It is!" was
his comment. "But we shall clean It.
Mr. Kent; we shall clean it If it shall
leave the People's party without a vote
in the State. Now what can . I do for
pie off at the door. and say, that for the
present I' refuse positively to; be'seen
or â¢ interviewed. They will 'Â¦ find ; me at

Union station at. the capitol.
Looking back - to the gray ' of : the
morning when he had' shaken hands
on the ton floor 'of, the, Kittleton build
ing, the crowding events made the in
terval seem more like a week; and now
the events themselves were \ beginning
to take , on dream-like incongruities in
the haze. of utter weariness. >: ', .
"Evening Argus! all about the p'llmi
nary trial of Governor Bucks. Argus,
sir?" piped a small boy at the stations
exit; but Kent shook his head, found a
cab and had himself : conveyed quickly
through streets still rife ,> with excite-*
ment to the Clarendon Hotel.
In the lobby. was^the same bee-buzz-,
ing crowd with which he had been con
tending all day, and he edged his way
through it to the elevator, praying that
he might go unrecognized â as he did.
Once safe in his rooms he sent for Lor-;
ing, stretching himself on the bed in a
very ecstasy of relaxation until the ex
manager came up. Then he emptied
his mind as an overladen ass. spills its
panniers.
"I'm done, Grantham,".. he. said, "and
that is more different kinds , of truth
than you have heard In a week. ' Go
and reorganiZH your .management, and
M'Tosh is the man to put in Halkett's
place. The strike will be declared off
at the mere mention of, your name 'and
his. That's all. Now go away, and, let
me sleep."
"Oh, hold on!" was the good-natured
protest; "I'm not more curious .than I
have to be. but I'd like to know how it
was done."
"I don't know, myself; and that's the
plain fact. But I suspect Marston fell
upon. Judge MacFarlane; gave him a
-wire hint, of what was due to arrive if
he didn't give us a clean bill of health.
I had my, preliminary Interview, with
the Governor at daybreak this morn
ing; and I was with him again between
9 and 10. He went over the original
papers with me, and about all he said,
was, 'Be In Gaston by 2 o'clock this af

"No; 1 1 1 can't go ; there : any more," said Â¦

meant It to be. â¢-
"Why not?" -
"There , were / good reasons before;.
there are better ones now." â¢ ; ,
; "A ' $700,000 difference?" ; suggested

Kent flushed a 'dull red.

"Humph ! There :â¢ is one difference be

David; it /could 'talk; sense, and â¢ you

Kent changed the subject abruptly.
: "Say, Ormsby; I'm, going into a po
litical office hunt. There is a. death va
cancy in: the House, ; and I^ mean to
have, the nomination, and; election. I
don't need money now, but I do need a

'.'Oh, sure.' Miss Van Brock will an

"But I don't want you to do It on her
account; I want you to do it for me."
"It's all one," said the clubmanv"
Kent looked up quickly.
-: "You are. right; ; that is the truest
word you've said to-night," and he
went away, . leaving the dessert un
touched. . - ;
The evening, was still -young when
Kent reached the house in Alamcda
square. Within the week the weather
had changed, and the -first chill of the
approaching autumn was: in the air.
The ' great square house" was lighted
and, warmed, and. the homeliness of the
place appealed to him as It never had
before. To her other gifts, which were
many; and diverse. Miss Van Brock
added that. of homemaking; and the af
termath of battle is apt to be an acute
longing for peace and. quiet, .for do
Â»mesticity and creature comforts.
He had not seen _Portla since the
night when she had armed him for the
final struggle with the enemy; he told
himself that he should not see her
again until the battle was fought and
won. But In no part of the struggle
had he been suffered to .lose sight, of
his obligation to her. * He had seen the
chain "lengthen .link by link, and now
in its most sensitive part.
"I. am' glad if. "it amuses you," he
frowned. "Only I meant' it in all seri
ousness." .
"No,, you .didn't;- you only thought
you ' did." she contradicted, and ? the
brown eyes were still. laughing at him.
"Let me tell you â¢ what you ; did mean.
You â¢ are pleased to think that . I have
helped youâ that an obligation has been
incurred; ; and you. meant io pay your
debt like a man and a gentleman in the
only coin a woman is supposed to
recognize."
"But if I should say that you are
misinterpreting the motive?" he sug
gested.' I *
"It would y make your nice' little
speech a " perjury * instead of a simple
untruth,' and I should say no, again, on
other, and perhaps better, 1 grounds."
"Name them," he said shortly. ;â¢ .
"I will, David; though I am neither a
stick nor a stone to do it without winc
ing. You love another woman with all
your heart and soul; and you know it."
"Well? You see I ant neither admit
ting nor denying."
"As if you needed to!" she scoffed.
"But don't interrupt me, please. You
said I might take what there is of you
and make what I can of it; I might
make you anything and everything in
the world, David, except that which a
woman craves most in a husbandâ a
lover." '
His eye*^rew dark.
"I wish I knew, how much thatvword
means to you, Portia." \ Â¦
"It means just as much to me as it ,
does to everv* woman who has ever
drawn the breath of life in a passionate
world. David., But that isn't all.
Leaving Miss Brentwood' out of the
question, you'd be miserably. unhappy."
"Why should I?"
"Because I shouldn't be able to real
ize a single one of your ideals. I know
what they are â what you will expect in
a wife. I could make you a rich man.
a successful man, as the world mea
sures success, and perhaps'I could even
give you love; after. the first flush of
youth is past, the heavenly affinity
sentiment loses its hold and a woman
comes to know that if she cares to try"
hard enough she can love any man who
will be -thoughtful- and gentle, and
whose habits of life are not hopelessly
at war with her own. But that kind of
love doesn't breed love. Your vanity
would pique itself for a little while, and
then you would know the curse of un
sought love and murder me in your
heart a thousand a day. No,
No. - David," I have "read you to little
purpose if these are the things you will
ask of the woman who takes your
name and becomes' the mother. of your

standing, beside his chair, with her
hand lightly touching his shoulder.
"Will you go now? There- are others
coming, and â "
, distance between themselves and Pe
nelope's joyous grinding out of a Wag
ner scroll. "It ' looks as if the owners
had walked out at a moment's notice."
"They did," said Kent. "They went
to Europe, I believe. ' And by the way;
I think I have a souvenir here some
where. Will you go up to the first
landing of the stair and point your
finger at that window?"
She did it. wondering; and when he
had the line of direction he knelt in the
cushioned window-seat and began to
probe -with the blade of his pen knife
in a small round hole in the woodwork.
"What is it?" she asked, coming
down to stand beside him.
"This." He had cut out a flattened
bullet and was holding it up for her to
see. â¢ "It was. meant for me. and I've
always had an idea that I heard it
strike the woodwork."
"For you? Were you ever here when
the house was occupied?"
"Yes, once: It is the Senator Duvall
place. This is the window where I
broke in."
She nodded intelligence.
"I know . now why* you are going to
buy\Jt. The Senator is another of tnose
whom you haven't forgiven.'.'
His laugh was a ready denial.
"I have nothing against Duvall. He
was one of Bucks' dupes, and he is
paying the price. The property is to be
sold at a forced sale, and it is a good
investment."
,"ls that all it means <o you? It Is too
fine to be hawked about as a thing to
make money with. It's a splendidly
ideal home â leaving out that thing that
Penelope Is quarreling with." And she
made a feint of stopping her ears.
He laughed again.
"Ormsby .says I ought to buy It, and
marry and settle down."
She took him, seriously.
"You don't need it. Miss Van Brock
has a very lovely home of her own,"
she said soberly.
. It was at-his" tongue's end to tell the
woman he loved how the woman he did
not love had refused him, but he saved
himself on the brink and said:
"Why Miss Van Brock?"
" "Because she Is vindictive, too,
"But I am not vindictive."
"Yea, you are. Do you know any
thing about Judge MacFarlane's family
affairs?"
"A little. He has three daughters;
one. of them rather unhappily married,
I believe."
"Have you . considered the cost to
these three women if you make their
father's name a byword In the city
where they were born?"
"He should have considered it," was
the unmoved reply.
"David!" she said; and he locked up
quickly.
"You want me to let him resign? It
would be compounding a felony. He is
"Put away that rope, boys! There's
law here, and by God we're going to

At this a man pushed 'his way out
of the thick of the crowd and climbs to
a eeat beside the chauffeur in the wait
ing automobile.
"They've got him," he says shortly.
"To the hotel- for all you're worth,
Hudglns; our part Is to get this on the
wires before 1 o'clock- Full speed, and

CHAPTER XXX
t Subhl 6adi!c
V The da"wn of a new day was graying
over the capital city and the newsboys
were crying lustily in the streets when
David Kent felt his way up the dark
staircases of the Kittleton building to
knock at the door of Judge Oliver Mar
eton's rooms on the top floor. He was
the bearer of tidings and he made no
more than a formal excuse for the un
seemly hour when the door was opened
by the Lieutenant Governor.
"I am sorry to disturb you, Judge
Marston," he began, when he had
closed the door at his back and was â¢
facing the tall thin figure in flannel
dressing gown and slippers, "but I
imagine I'm only a few minutes ahead
of the crowd. Have you heard the news
fit the night?"
The Judge pressed the button of the
droplight" and waved his visitor to a
chair.
"I have heard nothing, Mr. Kent.
Have a cigar?"â passing the , box of
unutterable Btogies.
"Thank you; not before breakfast,"
was the hasty reply. Then, without
another word of preface: "Judge Mar
ston, for the time being you arÂ« the.
Governor of the State and I have come
toâ"
"One moment," interrupted his lis
tener. "There are some stories that
read better for a foreword, however
brief. What has happened?"
* "This: last night it was-the purpose
of Governor Bucks and Receiver Gull
ford to go to Gaston Mfy, special train.
In some /manner, which has not- yet
been fully explained, there was. a con-,
fusion of orders. Instead or proceeding
eastward .the. special was switched to
the tracks of the western division; was
made the first section of the fast mall,
which had orders to-run through with- .
out stop. You can imagine the result".
Marston got upon his feet slowly and
began pacing the length" of , the long Â¦
room. / Kent waited, and the shrill cries
of the newsboys floated \ up and in
through the open windows. When the
Judge finally came back to his chair the
saturnine face was gray and haggard. '
"I. hope it was an accident that can
be clearly proved," he said; and a mo
men J later: "You spoke of Bucks and
Guilford; were there others in the, pri
vate car?" : '
"Two others; Halkett and the Gover-
you? You didn't come here at this hour
in the morning merely to bring me the
news." ; .
"No, I didn't, Judge Marston. I want
my railroad."
"You shall have it," was the prompt
response. "What have you done since
our last discussion of the subject?"
"I tried to 'obliterate* Judge Mac-
Farlane, as you suggested. But I
failed in the first step. Bucks and
Meigs refused to approvcthe quo war
ranto."
The Judge knitted his brows thought
fully. '
"That way is open to you now; but it
is long and devious, and delays are al
ways dangerous. You spoke of the re
ceivership as being part of a plan by
which your road was to be turned over
to an Eastern monopoly. How nearly
has that plan succeeded?"
Kent hesitated, not because he was
afraid to trust the man Oliver Marston,
but because there were some things
which the Governor of the State might
feel called upon to Investigate If the
knowledge of them were thrust upon
him. But in the end he took counsel of
utter frankness.
"So nearly that if Bucks and the re
ceiver had reached Gaston last night,
our road would now be in the hands of
the Plantagoulds under a ninety-nine
year lease.""
The merest ghost of a smile flitted
over the Lieutenant Governor's face
when he said, . with his nearest ap
proach to sarcasm:
"How extremely opportune the collu
sion of train orders becomes as we go
along! But answer one more question
if you please â It will not involve these
singularly heedless railway employes of
yours; is Judge Â¦ MacFarlane in Gaston
now?" Â¦
"He is. He. was to have met the
others, on the arrival of the special
train."
There were footsteps on the stair and
in the corridor, and Marston rose.
"Our privacy is about to be Invaded,
Mr. Kent. This is a " miserable busi
ness;; miserable for everybody,, but
most of all, for the deceived and hood
winked people of- an unhappy State.
God knows, I did not ; seek this office ;
but since it has fallen on me, I shall
do my duty . as I see it A and- my,' hand
shall be heaviest upon that man .who
makes > a mockery- of the justice he is
sworn to. administer. ;Come to the capi
tol a little later in the day, prepared to
go'at once to Gaston; I think I can
promise you your hearing on'the'merlts
without further delay.'!-.;
"Thank you," said Kent, - simply,
grasping : the '. . hand of leave taking.
Then he tried- to find other and larger
words. "I wish I could- do, something
to show my appreciation of yourâ"'
But the â¢Lieutenant,, Governor, was
pushing him: toward the door.
"You have done something, Mr. Kent,
and you can do more., Head those peo-
- "I didn't , have, after the men under
stood what was in the wind. Jarl Ole
son took me down and brought , me
back. -The council did it handsomely,
dipping into its treasury and paying
the mileage on a Pullman car."
"And MacFarlane reversed 'his own '
order?"
"Without a question. It was the
merest formality. Jennison, Hawk's
former law partner, stood for the. other
side: but he made'no argument." .
"Good!" said Loring.: "That will do
for the day's work. But now I'd Â¦ like
to know how last night's job was man
aged."
"I'm afraid you want to know more
lhan is good for you. â¢ What do the
papers say? I haven't looked at one all
day." v . '
"They say there was a misunder
standing of . orders. . ; That will j answer
for the "public, perhaps, but it won't do
for me." -.
"I guess it .will have to do for you,
too, Grantham," - said Kent, v yawning
shamelessly. , "Five^ men; rbesides my^
self â six of us in all â know the true in
wardness of last; night's round up.
There will never, be a seventh."
Loring's eye-glasses - fell from ,'his
nose," jand he' was smiling shrewdly
when Re replaced, them. , . ;Â¦
' "There is one small consequence that
doesn't : please you, I'm:' sure. You'll
have to bury the hatchet with Mac-
Farlane."
"Shall I?" flashed Kent, sitting up as
if he had been struck. with a whip.'>''Let
me tell you: Marston is going to call ah:

is a death vacancy In this district; and

She was waiting for him when he en

"I knew you would come to-night,"
she said cheerfully.; "I gave you a ddy

"I hope so. : I took the day for it, at

"I can imagine how. it took it out of
you," she assented. "Not so much the

-He.would 'have been less than a-man
Jf ;. his -self-love had -not been- touched
He made his adieux gravely and went
away half dazed and a prey to many
emotions, but Â¦ strangely light hearted
withal; and as once before, he walked
when he might have ridden. But the
mixed-emotion mood was not immortal.
At the. Clarendon .he found a com
mittee of Civic Leaguers waking to
ask him if he would stand as a "Good
Government" candidate in the capital
district; ;and in the discussion of ways
and means, and the settling of political
plans which followed there was little
food for sentiment.
It was three weeks and more after
Governor Marston's call summoning
the Assembly for an "investigative ses
sion. Kent had fought his way tri
umphantly through the special election
to a seat in the* House, aided and
abetted manfully by Ormsby, Hlldreth,
and the entire VTranswestern influence
and vote. And now men were begin
ning to say that without the tireless
blows ' of. the keen-witted, sharp-/
tongued young corporation lawyer, the
junta might sill have reasserted itself.
But the House Committee, of , which
Kent.. was the youngest member and
the chairman, had proved incorrupti
ble, and the day* of the . Gaston .wolf
pack was over.- Hendricks resigned, to
escape a worse thing; Meigs came over
to the majority with a show of hearti
ness that made > Kent doubly watchful
qf-him; heads fell to the right and left,
until at the last there was left only one
member of the original- cabal to reckon
with; the judicial tool of the â¢ capitol
ring. '
'.- Kent had hesitated when MacFar
lane's name came up; , and the Judge
never knew, that "he owed his escape
from the' inquisitorial House Com
mittee, and his permission to resign on
the plea of 'broken < health, to a ; young
woman whom he had never seen.--*/
â It was Elinor Brentwood who was his
intercessor; ; and the ; occasion was 'the
last day. "of 'the third week of the extra
sessionâ a Saturday . afternoon and a
legislative v recess when . Kent had bor
rowed .;>' Ormsby's r autocar, Â¦ and had
driven - Elinor.-; and ; Penelope ' â¢. out to
Pentland Place, to; look at a house; he
was thinking of buying/ " For ;with

bred; mania' for : plunging* In real estate
had returned; upon .him' with all the
', acuteness of a half Â¦'satisfied' passion. :
Â¦ .They had gone all over the house and
grounds with' the caretaker,' and * when
there Â¦ was ' nothing . more ' to ; see, Â¦ Penel
ope had prevailed ; on ;the- woman -to
open the Venetians in 1 the "music room.
I There * was ! a""- grand Â¦ piano -in the-' place

cal f piano-player; â¢ and ',: Penelope went:
into ! ecstacles of mockery... " : ' *\ - "â¢
J ; "Wait till I can i find the music scrolls,
; and 'I'll hypnotize " you," she : said 'glee
fully;/ arid*'l Kent . and 'Elinor, beat- a
hasty retreat. to, the, wide entrance hall.
"I don't quite understand it,',* was
Elinor's ' comment, when they; had put
a judge," and he was bribed."
She sat down beside him in the
cushioned window seat and began to
plead with him.
"You must let him go," she insisted.
"It is entirely in your hands as chair
man of the House Committee; the Gov
ernor, himself, told me so. vi know all
you, say about him is true: but he is
old and wretched, with only a little
while to live, at best."
There was a curious little smile curl
ins: his lip when he answered her.
"He has chosen a good advocate. It
is quite like a man of his stamp to try
to reach me through you." .
"David!" she said again. Then: "I
really shouldn't know him if. I were to
see him." ...
"Then why â " he began; but there
was -a' love-light in the blue-gray eyes
to set his heart aflre. "You are doing
this for me?" he said, trembling on the
verge of things unutterable.
"Yes. You don't know how it hurts
me tc- see you growjng hard and merci
less as you climb higher and higher in
the path you have marked out for your
self." . : â¢ . . . ,
"The path you have marked out for
me," he corrected. "Do you remember
our. little talk over. the embers of the
fire in your sitting-room a.t home? I
knew then that* I had: lost the love I
might have won; .but the desire to be
the kind of leader you were describing
was born in me at that moment. I
haven't always been true to the. Ideal.
I couldn't be, lacking the right to wear
your colors on my heart â "
"Don't!" she said. "I haven't been
true to my ideals. Iâ I sold them,
David!"
She was in his arms when she said, It.
and the* bachelor, maid was quite lost
in the woman.
"I'll never believe that.'* he said loy
ally. "But if you did, well buy them
backâ together."
Penelope was good to them. It was a
full half hour before she professed her
self satisfied with the mechanical piano
itoy; and when she was through, she
helped the woman caretaker to shut the
Venetians, with clanglngs that would
have warned the most oblivious pair of
lovers. .
And afterward, .when they were . free
of the house, she ran - ahead to the
waiting autocar, leaving Kent and Eli
nor to follow at a snail's pace down the
leaf-covered ' walk to the gate. There
was a'cedarihejlge'to mark the aide
walk '-- boundary, and while it still
screened them Kent bent quickly to the
upturned face of happiness.'
"One . more," he pleaded ; and when
he had "it: : "Do you know now, dearest,
why, I. brought you here to-day?"
â¢' She" nodded Joyously.
"It is the i sweetest , old place. And.
David, dear; we'll bring our ideals-^all
of â¢ them; " and it , shall be your haven
when the storms beat."*-

line of light some man who is will land her and marry her alive be

I could not but laugh at her quaint views. I hinted that if I
had shown some of the worldly improvement she saw in me now
upon a certain sentimental occasion when I did myself the honor of
asking a charming widowâ who was still my good friend to
marry me .I 1 ' might have had better luck. She received this per
sonal sally seriously, and after a pause responded : "Perhaps you
are right, Reuben. I'm not sworn not to remarry, and it might
have been that with your income, with your presentable looks
you are less gillified since you've taken your mind off politics and

would turn out a perfect man of the world, who knows what might

"Oh, I'll do that for you," she kindly replied.
And, Uncle Silas, she did, and with such wit that I was
amazed, and frankly said so; the more amazed because her, writing
is daintily witty, whereas her speech, as you recall, is calculated to
impress hearers with the belief that her vocabulary is as limited
as it is brusque.
: "You are deucedly bright, Polly," I said, and then blushed to
hear myself call , her by her first name. She overlooked that, or
seemed to, but laughed heartily at my use of the word "deucedly."
s *"Ypu .are a transformed^ man !" she declared, laughing. "Your use
of 'deucedly' tells, more' than all your 'tailor's extravagances, your
horses, clubs, petits soupres,.than ! ahyttiing" else. Bravo, Reuben f'
Mrs!: i Lacquerre's .arrangement of s my modest little play
changed the rival kings into queens; and they, with their following
of native girls, furnished the feminine portion of the, cast, and
diplomats and naval officers called for the services of a number of
my men friends. Mrs. Lacquerre played one of the queens and
, Aunt Sarah the other, and their witty hits at the brass band set
rivals kept my audience in merry mood. My part in the play was
the German Consul; whose duty it is to make a final decision as to
the rival claims, to the throne. Airs. Lacquerre was the queen in
whose favor I was to decide, and the action required that queen
" and consul rub noses, as is the custom among the natives, as a
sign of amicable relations. Mrs. Lacquerre looked bewitching,
having given rein to her pretty fancy in costumeâ besides being a
person of ;notable loveliness â so, at the moment our faces ap
proached to rub noses, a sudden spirit of mischief, which at few
months ago I would have considered myself incapable, of harbor
ing, made me salute her lips with mine, in lieu of the nose rub
bing.. The audience saw and laughed heartily at my daring, but
Aunt Sarah severely reproached me for the act as soon as chance
afforded her undisturbed opportunity. Aunt Sarah reminded me
that such an act was most unbecoming at any time, but in her
presence it came near being an insult, nq^ alone to her, but to her
daughter, my charming cousin, Josephine; My "dear aunt was em

tend any return of my warmth of affection for ; Mrs. Lacquerre,
and was \ appeased' only when I assured her of the unemotional na
ture of our friendship. Mrs. Lacquerre laughed the incident away,
as the others did ; in public; but later took me \ to; task about 'it in
terms which proves her possessed of still another unexpected vo
cabulary.
"It was a darn fool trick for you to do," she said to me. "Not
that I am objecting, to being kissed in publicâ the more public the
less harm. That's not : the point! You are queerihg* your own pros
pects, and that is. evidence of a lack of wit! hate to seeâ in you."
"My-own prospects \", I exclaimed. A :

marry you, and, knowing what a crank she is about the convention
alities, : you : get: gay': in' just: the way which willtake you' months to
S 9u&re. For ; Vmanvivho is in love with^rarices' you seem to know

For some: reason this view of the situation vexed - me, but I
politely responed to : Mrs. Lacquerre: "It is true that I hope to in

0EAR UNCLE SILAS: 1 am greatly pleased to receive
your letter saying that you will soon be in New York.
But its tenor rather than its explicit statements puzzles
me. You express lively interest in all that I said about
my declaration of love! to Miss Frances Lacquerre and
her decisive refusal of my hand, but nowhere in your letter do I
perceive a hint even that I may count upon your help in changing
the young lady's unreasonable state of mind. You do, to be sure,
tell me that you much admire her character â I recall that she has
expressed equally approving opinions of yours â and perhaps I
should consider that your approval of her, is tantamount to an as
surance that you will assist me in my suit, for if you approve her
and I want her â thus you may have unconsciously argued â I can
therefore count upon your help.
To inform you of the precise status here, that you may act
intelligently in respect to it, I find myself in unchanged relations
to the Lacquerre household, and that is, in essence, as if I should
say that I am treated as a member of it. I often have informed
you that I delight in discussing my plans with Mrs. Lacquerre.
She is sympathetic, and while she does not agree with my politi
cal ambitions, as I wrote you, she does agree and greatly help in
ray determination to devote a reasonable amount of my energies
to society affairs.
In this respect I must, as I do in all subjects, speak to you
without concealment. While I am not yet convinced that there
is material grave enough for my constant attention in the affairs
of the social world my views on the general subject have been
much modified by recent experiences, as well as by the advice and
counsel of Mrs. Lacquerre. ;She has patently pointed out to me
the advantage one of my wealth and intellect gains by intimate as
sociation with his equals, and I have come not only to agree with
her, but to enjoy my life as it is directed by her. I can without con
ceit assert that under her wise and friendly guidance I have ac
quired a pleasant aptitude in the art of entertaining, the men and
women I meet in herâ in my â world.
The life of a man of the world is not so futile, so lacking in
profitable activities, as I somewhat dogmatically have been prone
to adjudge it. I find that entertaining and being entertained by
agreeable people, having common interests and pastimes, has a
charm wholly unsuspected by me heretofore. I am even willing
to admit that in the earlier days of my intercourse with such peo
ple I may have displayed a determination amounting almost to .
uncouthness to make them consider my pet themes to the en
forced exclusion of theirs, lam now cognizant that social inter
course which is free from annoying friction largely results from
an accommodation of acts, of views, of manner, even of dress, .to
the end that an agreeable atmosphere of repose may prevail,
rather than an air disturbed by petty cross currents of aims and
standards.
, .1 . As I read over what is just here set down I am conscious that
it may address you as indicating a radical change in my ideals.
It may be so, but I must tell frankly .these things though they
excite apprehension at what you may consider a backsliding.
I spoke of this to Mrs. Lacquerre before I wrote it and she re
plied: "True, Reuben, your Uncle Silas may not agree with your
views, but he will not blame you for holding them. He is a man
who is content only when engaged in big and strenuous affairs, yet
he accommodates himself to the smaller things of our social world
and makes himself agreeable therein as well as the most, devoted
man of society. When he visits us he is quite a beau to Frances
and me, yet is rushing all over the lot, carrying deals through the
street, as if he held that the chief task of man is to give the finan
cial world the willies. That is why Frances is so chummy with
him." , .
"Indeed!" I exclaimed. "Is Frances, then, so chummy with
my Uncle Silas?".
"The best ever 1" declared Mrs. Lacquerre. "You see that,
while Frances is not yet nineteen, and your Uncle Si is my age,
thirty-nine, she is his elder in soberness of mind and severity of
standards. Oh, they are great pals I In one way he is your jun
ior. By the way, Reuben, just how old are you? â some one was
asking me."
"I am approaching my twenty-ninth birthday," I replied. "You
can remember the number as being ten, less than the age of my
uncle and ten more than that of Frances."
"Ten more than mine, too," commented Mrs. Â¦-'.Lacquerre
thoughtfully. Then she smiled and abruptly changed the subject.
I reminded her that she had promised to matronize an enter
tainmeni,. for me at my apartment, and as I had an 'accumulation
of social debts to discharge I urged an early date for the affair.
She named a convenient day and promised to fulfill her agree
ment to have a number; of handsome young ladies present, and
fewer mammas who would endeavor to carry my heart by direct
?assault. ,
Having acquired some knowledge in the matter of social en
tertainment, I determined to arrange the programme for my aft
ernoon at home without calling on Aunt Sarah for help. I had, 1 as
a mere exercise in composition, written a trifling comedy, based
upon some troubles in the Samoan Islands, when the diplomats of
Germany, England and America, assisted by the officers of some
warships of those countries, were all deeply involved in an effort
to untangle and adjust the rival claims to the Samoan ttirone made
by a couple of barefooted natives, whose posings before the world
were in themselves farcical, yet brought three great nations to the
verge of war. Thinking that such a 'light comedy as I had; written
would afford a suitable vehicle for r an amateur . performance, ' I
submitted it to Mrs. Lacquerre for her judgment. When . she had
read; it she said : "This is pretty ; good 1 tragedy for the profes
sional j stage, Reuben, : biit for our it must be adapted to
make a satire on the rival -claims; of certain '; women in Uhe brass:
band' set- in New York. Â¦ Their doings are much in print, but they
have no more. to do with swell society than your Samoans, had to
do with : weltpolitik." "
"Excellent!" I cfied, "but. I am not well enough informed as
to the brass band set's social politics to adapt my. play to such'
satire."

Harry Leon Wilson, whose brilliantly
daring novel, "The Seeker," Is provok

other day why he had written a book
so much unlike hl3 other successes.
"The Spenders" and "The Uons of the
Lord." He replied. "I wrote The
Seeker* because the story tqld Itself to
me and interested me. It seemed to
me one phase of the much larger story
that underlies the dry outer facts of
our present stage of social evolution
and the nÂ«w and ever-increasing sense
of brotherhood, of human oneness. Our
ideals as expressed in religious and so

fully In twenty-five years. I have tried
to trace this expansion to show how it
affected a small group of people of

llsning this book," writes Mr. Cleve
land In a preface, "the fact has not
been overlooked that the push and ac
tivity of our people's life.' lead them
more often to the "ntlcipatlon of new
happenings than to a review of events
which have already become a part of
the nation's history." But the ex-
President is right in believing that be
neath this "there still exists a sedate
and unimpaired interest In the things
that illustrate the design, the traditions
and the power of our Government."
The retrospective view he has given
of four, events of permanent influence
on , the trend of the Nation's affairs,
events of which his hand played a

His contest with the Senate over* the

removal of Federal officers, which had
its inception immediately upon his ac

A good plot, clever Incident and
swift movement are the elements which
unite to bring Oppenhelm's stories be
yond the mark of mediocrity. .The
writer has the trick of luring the
reader on from chapter to chapter Just
out of sheer curiosity, so telling Is the
denouement set forth in the very last
paragraphs of each. A face pressed at
the window, a, blow struck out of the
darkness, revelation of a plot trembling
on the turnâ these are the lures offered
by each succeeding development of the
plot, which set the reader to racing
madly along as fast as the eye can do
the mechanical work *f deciphering
type. Breathless suspension of inter
est by a careful restraint in the narra
tion of the tale works wonders.
"The Betrayal" is shrouded with
mystery, plot and , counterplot. It has
to do with the fortunes of a* young
college graduate who is made secretary
to the committee of national defense
in England at a time when martial
preparations on the part of France
boded war and the whole kingdom was
astew over the fear of invasion. His
post is necessarily one requiring ab
solute integrity and secrecy., So elab
orate are the provisions against the
revelation of their plans by the mem
bers of the committee that even the
combination word of their safe Is never
spoken aloud but scratched on paper
and passed from hand to hand. De
spite all of these barriers, however,
there is a leak and the French secret
service is constantly supplled,with the
hidden maps and campaign plans of
the council's making.
The twrtuous events leading up to the
discovery of the traitor rive opportu
nity for many - a thrill of adventure.
Wrapped about the main thread of the
story Is a sub-plot concerning the
hero's discovery of his father's unfor
tunate; fall from . integrity and the
mastery exerted over him by a daring
adventuress. r There is, of. course, a love
story weaving its way through the
book, but that is rather beside the
mark In comparison with the dynamic
energy of the mystery's narration.
Best of all. though it deals with dra
matic Incident and stirring adventure,
the book has nothing of the cheaply
sensational about it; it would not ap

"I get more ashamed and disgusted
of my nostrums daily," writes Thacke
ray from Boston; and again, "But he
(the writer) is growing so mortally sick
of the business that you may hear of
his striking work any day. I have been
paid for these lectures four times as
much money as they honestly .deserve."
This gerund grinding before literary
clubs had, however, itg object dear to
the man who so thoroughly detested it.
Â¦Whenever he speaks of the "dollars
rolling In" or the "sack heaping up," it
is with an avarice sweetened by the
aim In view. It Is always "for my girls
at home" that this money, gained at
such distasteful effort, came to the
author's pocket. Through all of the
letters there runs a tender allusion to
the writer's family, their needs, and it
Is ever the devotion of the man, to the
doty of supplying these needs that Im
presses itself unconsciously.
"What did Thackeray think of Amer
ica? He has answered that question
before in publlo and private corre
spondence. In these Baxter letters he
reiterates his admiration for America
and the Americans through Â¦peciflc
allusions.
"I hope, please God," writes Thacke
ray after his first visit here, "that the
love and friendship I have had in your
family may even go bo far as to do some
public benefitâ the remembrance of you
all sanctifies your country In my eyes.
"When people speak here sneerlngly. as
Londoners will talk, I break Â«ut in
dignantly and tell them how much
good and worth and love and rood
breeding there Is In the country of
which they talk. bo flippantly. And I
pray heaven it may be my chance, as
It will be ray endeavor, to be a peace
maker between us and you and to
speak good will toward you."
Again in reference to the misconcep
tion prevalent in America as â¢ to his
estimate of Washington, revealed In
"The Virginians," Thackeray declares:
"Can't we find any plan of healing
that absurd, 'Mr. Washington* feud? I
feel myself shocked and pained by it
as if some dear friend had turned
round to abuse me; I who for once in
my life kept my own counsel; who have
got to consider youra as my country
almost; who have praised the State* bo
outrageously since I came , home, and
made myself such a violent partisan.
How dare people think I could be
guilty of euch stupid abuse as they at
tribute to me?"
The noted Americans of the times
whom Thackeray met elicit character
istic comment from him. 'Of George
William Curtis' work in "Nile Notes"
he says:
'.The book is capital â too luscious to_
read much of at a time.'.' Dr. Oliver"
Wendell Holmes., whom Thackeray met
in Boston, was "a dear little fellow, a
true poet. I told him," continues the
writer, "how much I liked his verses
and what do you think he did? His eyes
began to water." X3t Mrs.^ Harriet
Beecher Stowe, whom chance' brought
to his acquaintance in London, he says:
"In place of the woman I had Imagined
to mvself after the hideous'daguerreo
type. I found a gentle, almost "prejtty
person, with a .very. great sweetness
in her eyes and smile. ; I am sure she
must be good and truth ' telling from
her face and behavior.' V Franklin
Pierce, \ President elect "Â¦ during;" Thack
eray's stay . in ' Washington^ February,'*'
1S53, impressed the novelist as "a man;
Thackeray first came to this country
to lecture in 1S52, his course being on
his well-known "English Humorists."
That he was well received, even lion
ized by the. elite, oa this side of the
water these letters bear additional evÂ»
dtnpe to that of other correspondence.
But this getting of dollars at the ex
pense of comfort, even of self -pride in
some instances, was " thoroughly dis
tasteful to the novelist.
Of all Thackeray's correspondence,
end It 1* voluminous, no part of It is
more a reflection of the inner soul of
the man than this. In these gossipy
epistles, some serious, most of them
gay and brimming with the cheerful
exuberance of the man. the genial
Pendennis has given full sway to his
own intimate thoughts. The whole
some love of the man for his chil
dren, his mother and his friends
stands revealed. His convictions oh
the snobbery of the social world, so
trenchantly delivered in his works,
find place likewise in his communings
with these friends. His opinions on
America, his estimates of contem
poraries, both In literature and state
craft, his own ethical code of right
living â each of these close and per
sonal elements in the life and thought
of the man voice themselves through
his written words. Besides all this
there is given us still more of the in
imitable fooling that characterizes
Thackeray's light correspondence.
Quips turned on a word, or the hold
ing of self up to derisive ridicule by
his correspondents, make whimsical
fun throughout the entire volume of
letters.

"The Life and Adventures of Jack
Philip" is the title of a volume com
piled and written largely by Edgar
Stantbn Maclay as a memorial to the
late admiral. Appearing flr3t in 1903
as a limited edition designed only for
friends and officers In the navy, the
work had such a large reading that the
present edition has been necessitated
to satisfy the demand. Though the
story of Admiral Philip's life is herein
given as nearly as possible in continu
ous narrative form, contributions
thereunto are made by a score of
friends of the former Officer, both in
and out of the, service. Captain Alfred
T. Mahan contributes the introduction.
Philip's own story of the Santiago aea
fight, , now a historical document,
forms a valuable portion of the book,
and the epigraph written by the mar
tyred McKinley gives the volume the
worth of serftlment. It is the story of
a brave man and efficient officer.

BY AUGUSTA PRESCOTT.
THE Dowager Duchess of Man
chester wears a semi-long cloak,
which she calls an Art Nouveau.
Sarah Bernhardt wears a long
cloak which she calls her Art
TCouveau cloak. And three society
women of New York are wearing coats
of this same description.
AH things point to the artistic new
cloak as the fashionable garment of the
winterâ the Art Nouveau.
, This cloak come3 in various styles
and one can cet it short, with flying
fronts, or one can get it long and dou
ble-breasted, effectually concealing the
sown underneath.
There are many things about the
new cloak which are very much in its
favor, one being that it can be made
to hide the gown. If one has no dress,
to wear, nothing that will pass muster
In a fine assembly, one can put on an
Art Nouveau cloak and be always cor
rect. â¢
It Is woman's duty to herself and to
her. family and to the World to invest
this- season in one of the new long
cloaks. It need not be of the ugly
three-quarter variety, which requires
an angelic figure, nor need it be one
-of those heavy things that Beem to
swallow you up In its depths. Nor
should it be an ulster or anything of
that nature. The ulster and its near
cousins are all very well for rain coats
and for auto coats and for utility wear,
but you want a . pretty cloak for nice
days/. â¢
"Your new cloak should be cut in the
new way, rather long:, rather straight,
rather ; trimmed in the front and with
the back looking as though it were
box plaited at the shoulders.
Or If can have . Japanese tendencies
and hang very much like a kimona
cloak. You can take your choice, for
both of these styles are very becoming.
But of one thing be very certain.
Your, hew ; cloak â¢ must be of the very
best material. It must be handsome in
pattern and it 'should be so abundantly
trimmed that It* will be a picture In
Itself, even without counting the grace*
and beauty of the wearer. And that is
what constitutes an Art Nouveau. ' *
The old-fashioned automobile; cloaks
were not pretty. But the, new ones are
lovely. Made of handsome cloth, some
times beautifully: figured and ;. supplied
with' from ' one to three deep collars.
an<3 shoulder capes,' they are things of
much grace. SS0&m2E&&tBKP&t&&
Then, too, the trimming of , the new
fashioned automobile cloak Is some
thing not to be forgotten: The front is.
faced and trimmed with a deep band
of brocaded satin, one of ; the durable
qualities that wIJi stand the dust of
the road. Alongside the band ' of satin
there Is a trimming of passementerie;
Coats for Dust and llain.
.-. AH.: the coats are distinguished by
their nice trimming'. ' Even , the 'storm
coat . le i trimmed and _ there, is a hand
some collar Â¦ and . there , are deep satin
cuffs. And running ( through the â¢ trim
mings are dashes of color.
If . you - select . your own auto' cloak
why not choosy * shade of,- tan and
trim It with trirr;n:inÂ£fc through which
there; is a* note' of- scarlet. You will'.
The new art cloaks are won
derful thiiurs. fashioned of hand
some material and specially de

are displayed as the Ion? cloak

able things for the woman of
winter to wear.
Drown, the new brown. It Is a gor
geous' tint which looks- almbst red.
'This gown wasmade up- with . a little

way and edged 'with "narrow/ruffling.
The skirt was ruffled' and so were the
sleeves; But * the odd Â¦ part consisted
in' the medallions of suede, in a shade

Abundance of Trimmlnss.
: The making of a cloak is much sim
plified "this winter, by. the" abundance
of 'handsome trimmings : that are
f ered: 'Take, for ' Instance, the" lovely
medallions can; be bought They
come in \all , sizes, up to the: bigness of
your * hand. ' And I these ". can be taken
Â¦ arid s applied to a cloak in Â¦ most fetch
ing ways. BS9BMB ' ' â¢
â¢ "And;;speakingr(of .prices. .how. much :
-one can { do .with Â«.\very \ little .' money !
. Theotherjdayja woman i.with , a dollar
,to sperid'bn lace garnitures weni forth
in despair..' But after she had shopped
awhile. she found that; she could buy
_ lace'.; medallions, ''bothl " circles and
I squares," larger than ' a* silver dollar In
very- pretty ; patterns, ; in : either tan
eye to tne harmonies of dress. If sha
will- consider its requirements sh4
must realize how and why. when and
where the gown Is to be worn.
An excellent example of this was af
forded recently by a woman who went
into a fashionable dressmaking estab
lishment to purchase a gown. "I want
a dress," said she, "to wear with a
long cloak. My cloak is made of black
broadcloth, with a box plaited back.
It Is three-quarter length, is trimmed
with silk cords, silk fringe and silk
tassels. It opens down the front and
is always worn open."
"Then," said the modiste, "I would
suggest a. gown trimmed down the
front with a bodice with a vest -effect.
As the coat flies open this handsome
front trimming will be very effective."
So she made a gown with a ruffled
lace vest, .the lace ruffles all escaping
down the front of the vest, each ruffle
trimmed with a little colored silk em
broidery, and the skirt was made with
a marvelous scroll work of silk shir-,
rings, with handsome velvet rosettes
set in the middle of the shlrrings. .
Around the foot of the, skirt there was ,
a handsome flounce with silk shlrrings
and rosettes. "With a three-quarter
cloak this gown was charming., -
Match Your Cloak to Your Gown.
It Is not always that a woman can
match her cloak to her gown,' but she
can very often do- so. Even when they
do not match In color and in material
they can be made to harmonize in
other ways. The cloak can be.cutxso
as to, show off the trimmings* on the
gown or it can be trimmed with the
same kind of .lace or, perhaps,' with
fringe .to correspond.
So much depends upon this preser
vation of the harmonies that : a woman
is wise who thinks first of harmony and
afterward of color and material. It
takes only a touch, Just -the. slightest
thing, to bring the two Into. keeping
with each .other. '" \
The conscientious fashion writer Is
called upon these days to give advice,
and,- like the doctor, the clergyman, the
lawyer and all other professional ad
visers/she must do the best she can
by those .who make inquiries.
To the otflce of a well known fashion
magazine there traveled .the, other .day
a letter from a reader asking how she
could purchase handsome trimmings at
a low. price. "I 'am anxious," said the
writer, "to be well dressed.- But I find
the materials so very expensive..- A sin
gle yard of passementerie costs upward
cf 510 and a handsome .yard of. lace
costs anything you want to pay for it.
How,-thenÂ» Is a woman, of _ economical
tendencies going to manage- -to "look*
well ; and 4 be suitably dressed?"
To this question there are many re
plies. But the most rational suggestion
of them all would be. to choose cheaper
trimmings. And there are cheaper
ones which look very well Indeed.
Cordings. of the.; shirred variety can
be mentioned as one. form of a cheap
pretty trimming. With a yard of white
satin cut on the bias. one can make a
great quantity of shirred cording Let
the cords vary in size.; and ,usÂ« them
h: dlfTerentiways on the skirt. -
A woman .who is noted for her taste
.in dress .obtained a.; really handsome
effect by .taking two yards of celery
green satin, which she cut into narrow
strips and -used for. shirred cordings.
One very. large cord headed the deep
flounce on her skirt. A smaller cord-
Ing ; outlined a band of lace insertion
and stiirmore cordings trimmed the
waist. .The result was remarkably
pretty and cost comparatively little.
Fold" trimmings are inexpensive and
very pretty and there Is such a variety
of .folds that one need not fear, monot
ony. ; There are all kinds of folds from
the tiny fold. which is called a piping
to the wide fold which is box plaited
and; stitched around the skirt as a
trimming. One can get r up â¢ some re

wear things that harmonize. Last win

for evening effects, with turquoise blue

you Â¦ have a friend | going to the Philip
pines give him a* commission to bring
back the robe of a mandarin. He can
buy It there for a song compared to the

The mandarin robes are worn almost
without alteration. It would surprise

The Coat of a Mandarin.
A woman wrote to a friend in Paris
to ascertain the fashionable shades,
and .this was her reply: ""Wear ash
gray, Havana brown and smoke blue.
Sometimes wear gunpowder blue and
celery green or spinach green. Rosa,
heliotrope, orchid pink and blotting
paper pink are seen a great deal and
champagne yellow,. Ivory whits and
pearl gray are worn by the best dressed
people in town. Don't forget that seal
skin brown Is very smart and that
chamois yellow and raspberry red are
also worn, as are mink brown, mignon
ette green end pansy purple. Opal yel
low Is for evening wear, lemon yellow
for dinner -and evening and turquolsa
blue for day or night."
The woman who wants to dress well,
and there are few women who do not,
will accomplish her purpose a great

color, cream or white, all for the sum
of 8 cents. For 5 cents she could buy
some very pretty medalHons of a
slightly smaller size. ISo/wvwith gar
nitures-as cheap as this, it does not
look as though a woman need go
without trimmings.
Fringes are to be worn in remark
ably pretty ways. A white felt turban,
rolling up all the way around, was
trimmed with white silk fringe. The
cloak was trimmed with fringe, which
fell around the collar, and the skirt was
trimmed with 'a wide flounce, which
was headed' with a looping of the

The fad for dressing in black and
white has crept in and It seems in
strange contrast to the brilliancy of
the Oriental trimmings and very restful
to the eye at the same time.
Wonderful Oriental trimmings, so gay
that they are almost barbarian in their
splendor, are worn one day and the
next there is a gown which shows no
colors .exceDt black and white. Jets,
passementeries, white lace and black
broadcloth make the ingredients for a
handsome gown.
The black and white gowri. called the
magpie, is fashionable Just for the
moment in New York, while in Paris
they are wearing turquoise and black
and turquoise and white. And in Lon
don they are wearing pink and black,
and the pink is the shade known as
blotting paper pink. It is a very soft,
pretty color, Just the thing to combine
with black or with white.

he had been chosen to do, but we'for
get what they were at this particular
moment. D. Webster wasn't shy on
specific remedies either, which he in
tended to apply when he should .'be
boosted into power. He informed the
voters of the commonwealth that, if
they would present ; him with a four
years' lease of the big house "on the"

Furthermore, p. Webster assured

open mindedâ populace that he had a
sure tip on the source of legislative/
executive and judicial iniquity and that
when he' got through with it there

'About the: time that the hoi.polloi

be' something In what D. Webster, was
'telling them there happened to be a
vacancy' in .the throne room ot the : ex
\. ecutive ; mansion " and some / one sug
gested ' that* D.'; Webster's braiii be
measured for the unemployed crown.
The .process â¢ is what Is commonly Â¦Â¦
..known as'the exercise of the sovereign
jWill of the people,. but it grieves us to^
-state that 'about 'all', that the people had ;
to fdb" with 'it : .was' to carry : a torch in
the ; procession , and vote "right" when
the 'time came. The heavy work was
attended to ' by 1 sundry . gentlemen â¢ who
sat in a secluded chamber doing vari
ous stunts in* simple addition and ex
perimenting'with a. new -kind of dou
ble-ended campaign pledge with a se
cret exit at the 'rear.
Â¦ : D. . Webster suspected that there was
something crooked about the. business,
but he reflected that life is a com
promiseâwhen it Isn't : a 'surrender â
and that sometimes it -Is necessary to
stoop to conquer." This seemed to him
to be one v of the -times. .After he was
firmly planted in the executive -saddle
he could bid a fondadieu to those who
had given him a . leg tip. ; At any rate,
he was sure that he was a much better
mjanthan any one^ else they could, have
found " arid. . fortified 'by ; that . soothing

seemed to demand. .There were several
other/ things \ which ' he -was Â¦ under obll
gaticrnVto support,* but \ he didn't .men

The first move' that D. Webster, made
after he ; hud ; landed ') the mustard was
to fgb". after! the : railroads for ; the ' back
taxes .which hta i predecessor, had over-'
looked. V. It looked 'Â¦. like an" easy 5 game;

business "that the .'. status quo ante
"would :; hot be ; disturbed.^ "Aboiit '- this
time D. Webster ;began to have a'suV
picion that he was going to lose his
ante if he didn't look sharp. Being
good .-; and holding . office at the same
time didn't appear to. be such a simple
proposition as when he had regarded
it from the outside. Â¦
Â¦ At any. rate he assured his conscience
he would never submit to having pub
lic office made anything Other than a
public trust. : He believed this for near
ly a week, when his State chairman in
formed him that the thing for, him to
do was to ' bust the trust and appoint
Billy McCann trustee of the State uni
versity. .Billy McCann's chief claim to
glory- and a lien on the . State treasury
lay> in the fact that he owned a brew
ery and fifty saloons and could de
liver "the Mack vote without a hitch
in' the rollcall. Again D. Webster rec
ognized the inevitable at .sight and
succumbed, still cherishing in his heart
the theory that he was so far superior
to other men; that he was -worth the
money whether he Jugged all the ras
cals â¢ or not. Merely to have a â¢ truly
good man in ofnee is uplifting, whether
he works at his trade or â¢ not.

bandit kings. Mudville, I1L, harbored a
bold and hardy race of cave dwellers,

short school vacations on which I could
draw at Eight. Moreover, the stock
holders in my company declared them
selves in on the dividend, and an era
of prosperity struck the town.
The amateur mining craze first broke
out in our own back yard. There was
nothing to it, I thought, but .a neat lit
tle coal business at home, and perhaps
a pottery on the side. When the idea
blossomed, I spoke to my younger
brother. Bill, about It.
A Natural-Bora Promoter. '
"What's the use of digging where
there ain't no coal?" inquired the prac

That is where the nromoter gets up
against it always. The trouble with
Bill was he lacked imagination. Why

Of course the -widow missed the cow.
and a lot of dlligfent, self-sacrificing
boys were willing. to give up their
studies and help the widow's sons seek
.that which was lost. The board of dl
. rectors,- to a boy, responded nobly, and

At the same time, the mishap at the
mine thwarted my career as a mining
promoter, and I'm glad of it. The love of
fishing acquired and fostered during the
futile probing of the Mudville Cow
Mystery Is now the one solace of my
declining years. I had rather fish and
.lie. than be rich. One day. perhaps, in
future ages, excavators will come upon
the skull -and bones of a prehistoric
Mudville cow burled sixteen feet under

'.Whilef the. daredevil Marsh was be
low -the- stock company 'withdrew to a
vacant lot across the alley.? Hefapplied
the match tind climbed the ladder, the
rungs of which were bits' of . lath, se
curely spiked to the uprights with
tacks' and second-hand shingle nails.
Just as the head of the intrepid Sloats
poked out of - the hole the rung : on
which his fat feet rested broke off.
The fall jerked loose the slat in his
grip, and down he went with an awful
burring sound, clutching at every, rung
from top to ; bottom. Â¦ /.
Silence more appalling than sound
followed the thud when Marsh hit-bot
tom; then came an anguished shriek of
terror and jj calls for help. The shaft
erupted the agony of young Sloats en
tombed with the blast, while we stood
paralyzed watching ;? for his atoms.
Marsh begged his ; father; and mother
and. an uncle who lived in Nebraska to
save'; him. >,' He cursed the company for
not .lowering j the , bucket, but mortal
fear held Jus in a pallid . group across
the alley. The fuse had' burned In be
yond the, reach â¢ of . his fingers,- and it
was up to the boss blast toucher* to
take .what was coming. to him. -
.When it came, a whirling spiral cloud
of white smoke, â¢ punctured ..by. one
hHeous yell, "shot up from the shaft.
At the summit:* of the cloud, twenty
feet in air, rode Marsh's limp straw hat.
That was all.- ' Nothing moreâ not even
a soundâ boiled rout of the shaft, so
the j more"; courageous directors sneaked
to the.edsre and. looked down.
Â¦ Sloats \ sat < with ~ his back braced
against the wall, -and was mining dirt
out of his eyes, mouth, nose and ears,
using J hl8 : fingers for picks. The lan
guage, that flowed from him dispelled
the sulphur- fumes and deadly after

left a string of firecracker fuses hang

question of nerve td touch off the blast.

scattered like* a' flock of quail. He was
able and willing .to lick the whole

Wilson, the mine boss, routed me oat.

; corpse,"" and - Roger was doing a~ Paul

meeting . at : the ; mine. '
In the ,; pale gray light of dawn a
crowd of terror-stricken kids stood
â¢ about ; the . hole and peered in at the Â¦
cow,- who seemed to be standing on her
horns. v â¢ To the ! dullest mind present It '

In a short time we sunk a square

him forth and pointed with pride to the
hole. - He = looked ; about? at the â¢ yellow
clay smeared , over. half the " fertile gar
den spot on which" * he had lavished
money and manure. ; We expected loud
outbursts of 'Â¦ praise. Instead father
asked quietly:' ; v . Â¦'*. â¢
"Did you boys dig out ' all this dirt ?."
"Yes, sir," we chortled. : "It was my
idea and Bill he- â â " " , ;
shouldn't there be coal in our back yard
If he only thought so? Bill was a pep
pery kid, full of force long before Sun
ny Jim's time, Â¦: and : would V. make !a,
valued assistant in the mining venture.
"If I prove there is coal in ' the i lot
will you help me dig?" I asked Bill.
He, said he would, and I soon con
vinced that easy, mark, being a natural
born, promoter, myself. Reading was
my only vice at that date. In order to
get at the books I bunkoed the Warner
County Library Association in the most
cruel and sordid manner. Twice [ each
week In winter I toted half a ton of
coal in buckets up. three flights of stairs
from a cellar under the sidewalk. The
librarian was a very old man with two
cork legs, and on that account he was
ashamed to be seen carrying the coal
himself.
In return for my trifling service the
librarian gave me a book privilege
ticket, good for six months, and worth
$1 50. It makes me blush even now to
think how I swindled that poor old man,
but I was like the drunkard away from
his can. My very, being for
choice miscellany, useful facts worth
knowing and light summer reading in
winter. A deep and soulful longing for
knowledge made me desperate, and I
soon picked up a lot about coalâ in
buckets. : : ,'
Well. I had read of the divining rod.
and with that bit of witchery worked
Bill to the limit First I > salted the
onion bed Just west, of the: raspberry
patch, by planting a flat lump of coal
six Inches underground and marking
the spot. Then, with an apple twig in
the form of a Y, I led Bill to his doom.
He followed, pop-eyed, while I trailed
about the garden, holding the divining
rod bÂ« the double ends,; with the stem
of the Y pointing straight 'ahead. At
the proper place the magic stem bent
downward, and I whisv** Â»d hoarsely
"Dig here for treasure!"
1 allowed him to dig, and when Bill
uncovered the lumps of coal, he became
lit up with the most gorgeous blaze of.
enthusiasm I ever beheld in a human
being. That was promoting some, all
right. Bill wanted to dig on the night
shift, too, but I "wouldn't let him. In
a few days we sunk a shaft five or six
feet deep and ran a drift to one side
in search of the. mother- lode. To sup
port the roof of the tunnel, we knocked
the rain water barrel to pieces, sawed
the staves in half and braced* them up
with timbers taken from the family
woodpile. . This was the only time we
ever tackled the bucksaw in the role
of little volunteers.

it. When the stjda is dissolved
moisten the warts thoroughly several
times each day with the solution and
they will gradually disappear. If the

the calloused skin with a nail file.
This will allow the soda solution to

fashion, as though she were debating
how â¢ many strides would take her to

No. That is not the well-bred woman.
Her mind is not on her own behavior,
but upon her hostess and her Interests,
and for. this simple reason she is de

Really, truly, bashfulness does not
mean diffidence, quietness or. even shy
ness, but that all-enveloping some
thing that settles down like a gentle
cloud and bereaves one of evejy power
save that of blushing frantically and
f urlously^ time and time again.
. Perhaps this a/fliction is helped on
its way not a little by the delightful
ly frank fashion which so-called polite y
society has of scrutinizing everybody'
and everything that chances its way.
Many times if lorgnettes were leveled
the effect could not be more startling
nor more insolent, and it takes a wom
an possessed with a goodly share of
worldly wisdom to present that I
don't-know-you're-looking expression
and go serenely and evenly upon her
way.
Just why people imagine they are
entitled to stare at others as though
they were little short of curiosities is
quite beyond me. Yet every dayâ in
fact If one will but take the trouble
to notice In every car â there Is that
close, f neighborly scrutiny which
makes one fairly bristle with indigna
tion. Not so very long ago I chanced
to meet a girl of sixteen or there
about, flying along the street with
flaming cheeks and angry, suspicious
eyes.
"Where are you going in such a tre
mendous Â¦ rush ?" I asked her, as she
swept along. "Honie, where people
don't think I'm a walking advertise
ment for a gold mine," she answered
in a quivering voice. "I'm so embar
rassed I can't see straight."
And the cause of her woes was noth
ing more or less" than a few gold binds.
In other words, she' was having her
teeth straightened and was beings tor
tured.both mentally and physically, by
the protruding glitter that refused to
permit her to close her mouth in
peace. *
. Doubtlessly it never occurred to those
who glanced' at her so curiously^ that
they, were committing ; a breach of eti

nervous flurry, that / my, little ; friend
failed to realize that she was not mak

of the old veterans:
"You just mark my words. If we
ever get into a brush with the reds
it will take four men apiece to hold
these dudes on the firing line."
The "Jim-Dandies" were attracted to
each other and formed a coterie. They
organized a glee club, sang love songs,
read popular novels and bought toilet
soap. They even wore linen collars
and carried clean handkerchiefs, and It
was said of at least three c" then that
they rubbed their faces with bay rum
after a shave. The "Jims" were guyed
and ridiculed, but they went their way
and bideu their time.
They had put in a year of this when
the call came for the Ninth to take
the field. The red men had grown
tired of . eace and wanted war again.
"Now keep your eyes on our 'Jim-
Dandies,' " eaid the veterans to each
other as they went marching away.
"If we buck up against the Sioux you'll
see six sissy men fainting away to be
chucked into an ambulance."
The Ninth went out for business and
found It. On the third day after leav
ing the fort ' it found a big force of
Indians in its front, and the fight was
hot from the beginning. The reds had
the advantage of numbers, and by .and
c by they began to work around on the
left flank of the command. The colo
nel saw it, but he could spare oniy
a few men to checkmate the move.
They must get into the broken ground
and die fighting. It was a military
necessity that a small force should ba
sent, but he hesitated to issue the or
der, and finally called for sergeant to
lead a band of volunteers. The six
"Jim-Dandie3"- V came to the. front at
once. Even on the march they had
clean collars on.
'"What in time is this!" growled the
sergeant as they stepped out. "It's
goin' to take old veterans to hold that
ground, and these are only dudes."
. "Give us a chance, colonel," appealed
one of the' "Jims." *
"Splendid move of . yonra, colonel."
said the major when the fight had been
won.
"But I couldn't have made It with
out the singing. Tell Captain Barnes
to send hla six 'Jim-Dandies* to me.
I want to thank "em personally. A
dude club beats artillery all to
pieces at flghtlngrlndlanal" .
Indians almost ceased tfieir firÂ© as*
thejr wondered what was up.
"Now, dudes," said the sergeant as
they, reached cover, "this Is no mak
ing love to a red-headed girl on the
veranda of a summer hotel. We've
got to hold them Injuns off this flank
if we die trying. You've got a
chance to show what you're made of,
and durn my buttons if I don't phis
the first man who looks to the rear!"
The Ninth had gotten Itself into a
hole. It was not strong enough .to
drive the enemy from its front, and '
were it to attempt a retrograde move
ment the Indians would be encouraged
to swarm out In full force. The officers
saw the situation before the men did,
but when the latter became aware- of It
there was a flutter along the lines. It
might have been more th.an* a flutter,
and the colonel's heart was la his
mouth an<j his teeth set hard, when
from the "Jim-Dandles" over oa the
flank came the rousing chorus of
"John Brown." It stopped the flutter.
Some men laughed and some swore.
but the song led their thoughts Into
another channel.
Again the Indians pressed down on
the left flank. They had discovered,
that only half a dozen men opposed
them, and that to win the flank was
to win the battle, but even with five
to one, owing to the nature of the
ground, they could makÂ© no way. Tha
"Jims" were shooting to kill when
they were not laughing or singing
and the sergeant watched them close
ly and muttered to. himself:
"I've been down on these dudes aloof
with the crowd, but blast my eyes If I
ever saw purtier flghtin*. I guess I*va
got to take back what I've said. Say,
now, but what's the matter over In tha
center?" â¢ Â» ".
The matter was that a company wu
being withdrawn to reinforce tha
right, but the movement caused "un
easiness and a slackening of the flre.
Men were beginning to look to the rear
and breathe heavily, and the Indians to
utter whoops -of exultation and make
ready for a rush, when the six "Jim-
Dandies." who were temporarily out of
it, leaped up on the rocks and began
to sing a topical sonar. It was new to
most of their comrades, and tha Jolly
air caught on at ones, and started
cheers til along the line.
Two hundred men Joined la" .the
chorus, and they were singing yet as
the colonel perfected his plans and or
dered a forward movement. There was
a grand charge and a rout, and the
Ninth had not only extricated Itself,
but won a victory to be proud of.
"Spring," he muttered musingly, "is
Just bursting into young summerhood."
Then his lips twitched slightly and he
tried again.
"That apple tree looks like some
sweet, sedate Quaker lady."
He stretched his eyes open wide as
if to fling off some irresistible, influence.
"Good Lord, am I a poet after all?"
he demanded comically cf the shadowy
self that always attends us, but never
bo palpably es in solitudes. And then
he smiled and lay staring up into the
great arch of the blue above him.
Again the silts grew narrower, almost
At the end of an hour's walk he
found that the path ended abruptly at
a grassy knoll. For a few moments
Trenham gazed with an appreciation
too deep for words. Then with a sigh
of contentment he sank down upon
the thick grass and stretched himself
out, his head resting in the hollow of
his clasped hands, his eyes narrowed
to slits like sate keepers who would
eay to the beauties about them, "One
at a. time, please."
And presently the slits became nar
rower and narrower.
TRENHAM arrived at Cantico at
1:30. At 2 Norton's silent, ef
ficient serving man was formally
introducing him to. the. Hutch â
his for a month â a squat. Oriental
looking building standing in the tem
pered shade of the pines and larches
and containing all those touches of
home comfort usually ascribed to
feminine hands, but found in the mod
ern bachelor Quarters.
At 2:30, his tweed suit changed for
a more formal costume, he emerged
from the low, broad doorway, stirred
by a pagan desire to get closer still
to nature, out into the dim, cloistered
places of the woods, where he might
Coat deliclously upon a sea of silence,
whose calm was unbroken save by the
ripple of a bird note or the snapping
of a twig.
"I say, but this is great!" burst
from his lips luxuriously as hÂ© drew
In long whiffs of the suave air with
its warm, elusive scent of sweet, grow
lnc things. "This Is life. This Is
what man was meant for."
As he ceased speaking he lifted his
face to the soft breeze that caressed
his cheek like a spirit hand and
thought unflattering: things of civiliza
tion. What after all did this boasted
condition mean? What but crowded
cities with stone where turf should be,
the roar of trains, shrieking of whis
tles, whizzing- ou autos. clattering of
hoofs and the grind, grind, grind of
office life. As he thought of It now,
looking as he was straight Into na
ture's smiling, Inscrutable face, it all
seemed supremely ridiculous. Fauns
and satyrs, hamadryads and naiads
had been wiser.
Daringly she stood and gazed dt him,
tingling with the fear that he might
awaken, vet too interested to turn
away. The blue of her eyes was
matched by the color of the linen gown
she wore. Around her neck a dandelion
chain dangled like a cable of rich gold.
With a sudden movement she lifted
the latter, breaking off a part of it and
fastening It into a wreath. Again she
hesitated. .Then, with her under lip
held between her teeth in a way that
showed ' two very - merry dimples, she
took a letter from her dress, hurriedly
extracted a - tiny pencil from the ',', eÂ©Â»
So had Natica Duke written to a
friend soon after coming to Cantlco for
the summer. There were few houses
In the regionâ a half dozen within
twenty miles, and her first impression
of the- country was only deepened by
her long, solitary strolls. She had a
mystical feeling that there was'some
thing to be discoveredâ some -secret
that ehe was forever on the verge of.
Godllng, gnome or fairy, she fancied,
might rise in her path at any moment
without causing her any surprise, and
so it was without dismay that she
stopped short at the edge of the wood
one day upon finding her favorite spot
already occupied.
For the fraction of a second she half
believed. Then she wholly disbelieved.
No godling would appear in tan ox
fords. Sandals were the utmost one
could conceive! Still, as a mortal, the
sleeping youth before her was worth
consideration. A glance told her that,
and she cautiously drew a step nearer.
He lay so that the spreading branch
of a tree shaded his face, his' soft linen
hat tossed on the grass beside him,
thus revealing the thick dark hair, that
looked as If It might have curled had
not 1U owner sternly refused to hear of
such a thing." His features reminded
her strangely of certain marbles she
had seen, they were so massive, yet so
finished, and with girlish attention to
dress she bestowed an approving
glance on his white negligee shirt, the
sleeves rolled up to the elbows, and the
duck trousers to match. If he was not
a godllng he was at least a most at
tractive mortal..
"It's a singular sleeping beauty of a
place-^-has a breathless, charmed air,
as if it were under a spell. I believe
there are fairies or godllngs to be dis
covered."
â¢ â¢ â¢
"It's a il*V" . he murmured drowsily.
"Great Pan's not dead. Great Panâ"
The murmur ended In a knowing
smile, the smile of one who has learned
for a certainty .what fools most mortals
be and that in turn faded irito gravity.
Trenham slept.

wouldn't have a bit of respect for him.

enough to bluff the stay-at-homes

time and been belle of the beach. Be

walk down Fifth avenue and you'll
see more admiring sons of Adam in

week. Haplessly yours.

"Day after yesterday.
"Hello. Central. AH hail the Man!
He came, he saw, and Ceasar isn't a
circumstance. He has taken the large
corner room. Mrs. Banks, our gen
eral overseer, says he is an exception
al young man. Wonder how much
board he paid in advance?
"He isn't real young, nor real old,
just that Intermediate age that Is so
interesting. I don't think he is ex
actly handsome, but you know what
a properly trimmed Vandyke and a
pair of rimless eyeglasses will do for
any man. He's that kind.
"This morning he escorted all of us
through the glen. Did I tell you that
we had a glen? Oh. yes. Glen Ellyn.
Just ferninst the villa. It's a break
in the sand bluff, and It's damp and
piney and darksome at midday. Here
tofore the organdie flock had reli
giously eschewed its ferny cwampi
ness. but you should have seen us
trail after him over fen and stump
and hidden vine the while he fished
out dinky little weeds and discoursed
on them.
'I opine he is a botanist. Well, it's
better than a barber. A letter came
for him to-<lay addressed to Profes
sor Adrian Vo^el. How's that for in
dividuality. He looksgt, too. He does
not dance and he does not play the
mandolin. â¢ He goes for his morning
dip at some unearthly hour before we
are up. I^i fact, he does not do any
of the orthodox summer 'manisms,'
but he has manners and customs of
his own.
"For instance, he sings, and sings
well. There are about ninety and
nine Muses who group themselves in
the parlors after dinner to listen to
their Apollo. When he sings 'All
Aboard for Dreamland,' he looks at you
cs much as to say he has only two
passes for the boat, but the other one
is for vou.
"Yachting and autoing he classes
as nerve racking, but nature, and close
to nature's heart, and all the rest of
It, is what the professor's joy is. I
think, privately, we would get closer
to nature's heart, and the professor's
heart, too, if he could be made to un
derstand the expediency of individual
lessons for his botany pupils. He
calls for a class, and we are all
classed.
"I hoDe for the best. So do the
other ninety and eight Muses.

ninjg'up there, and while It was none
of her business and she had no inter
est in the professor as a lovely man,
or in the continuance of his regular

might be a good thing.
" 'In mountainous countries,' began
Agatha, the artist _ who has been
Europized, 'I believe they tie a rope

doesn't. ,
7'SIacGregor Clarence Blair said he
hadn't jshown up ' since - breakfast, and
he'd seen him- making a bee line . for
the glen, and he'd said, what's, yer
hurry?, and the professor had said he
hoped he could have one morning in
peace to study without that thunder-
Ing, crowd of old maids hiking after
him:
"We didn't believe MacGregor. Ha
looks like a Dale, new sand fly. and
his father vid mother own all of No
Man's Land. The professor never in
all this world used such words,, as
hiking and thundering, but Mac-
Gregor did. Therefore. I may say. in
the same common parlance, that the
whole thundering crowd of old maids
pitched in and lambasted Mac-
Gregor until his pretty , white linen
suit was not fair to see. and his
twining curls were full of sand burrs.
Then he howled . and retracted, and
we all went up the glen after the pro
fessor.
"The glen deepens and darkens as
you go in, and the sides are rocky and
precipitous, with much shrubbery and
undergrowth, and scraggly pine trees
lifted to windward. And Just as the
first streak of lightning quivered in
the sky we heard a faint shout for
help.
"It. was the professor. He hung sus
pended in air en the bare limb of a
dead pine that jutted out from the rock
half way up the bluff, like Genius on
Pegasus, the widow said, on a petrified
Pegasus.
Â¦ "Then Genevieve Persey, our college
product, said Pesagus couldn't be petri
fied. He would have to be ossified.
And the widow .began to cry and sat
down on a .log and said she didn't care
a bit either way, ossified or petrified,
and Professor Vogel was such a lovely
man and always paid his board like
a gentleman and she hated to see* him
killed before her eyes and she never
felt so much like fainting before in all
her life.,

r _ KNOWS HABITS - OF HER BEES.
, Last year, the Baden-Powell bees gar
nered more than sixty pounds of honey,
which, was used either, in -the house
hold or given to friends. And so close
a study has Miss Baden-Powell made ot
her bees and the kinds of flowers they
affect, that as each bee'returns she can
tell whether it has been to Hyde Park,
the Green Park, or across ! the river to
Battersea Park, in quest V. of i supplies;.
No less striking , than the Baden Pow- :
ell apiary, however, is the aviary. "For t

the erstwhile Chicago street- railway
magnate, who has undertaken to solve'
London's traffic problems, so" far as
British officialdom and . old f ogyism
will let him, is> among the first to lease
one of the dainty suites, attached to
the enlarged Savoy Hotel. Thus he
obtains what . London has not before
afforded . himâ the seclusion of_ a self
contained flat with a j private office
attached and all the luxuries of a first
class hotel at his command. Hereto

Mr. Terkes says that â¢ he prefers : en

states that the reason for his preference
is that he does not find if necessary

they visited New i Zealand a year or

the Maori lady is known in her own
country, Is married to an Irishman
named Donnelly, who emigrated - to
New Zealand many years ago. but sha
has a very, high opinion of her own
importance and considers that she
confers : an honor , on â¢ Mrs. Adalr by
becoming her guest during the Irish
season.
It ia now freely admitted that the
American society women, with Mrs.
Adalr as. their leader, are doing much
to popularize Ireland as a tourist re
sort., This season Lady Barrymore,
Lady Donoughmore and the Duchess
of Manchester have been entertaining
a considerable number of wealthy
American people at their respective
places in Ireland.' Poverty-stricken
Donegal has benefited most' in conse

The making of this bust of Captain
EmiUi Is the most ambitious thing in
the sculpturing line \ that "B. P.*' ever
has undertaken. He models rapidly, as
he does everything else, and the Smith
bust, detailed as it is, has taken him
only a little more than- a month to
make. Incidentally, every, bit of work
that "B. P." has expended upon it has
been done between the hours of 4 and 7
o'clock in the morning. .
THE EARLY J BIRD.
But the chief difficulty was the fact
that there are so few authentic port
raits of Captain Smith. Some were in
the possession of Baden-Powell's fam
ily, but better ones, the general learned,
Â¦were owned by Americans, and after
correspondence ', he succeeded In bor
rowing some of these and getting a
good deal of valuable data besides.
So. with nothing but these various
prints and certain scientific and math
ematical calculations of his own. Gen
eral Baden-Powell commenced a work
which professional sculptors who have
seen It declare to.be good.
"B.-P." is descended, from Captain
Smith on his mother's side. She was
a "Smythe." and her father. Admiral
Smythe, came down In a direct; line
from the doughty colonizer whose life
Pocahnntas was reputed to have saved.
The task of making a bust of Cap
tain John Smith was a difficult one in
many ways, a fact that probably made
It additionally attractive to Baden-
Powell. To begin with, as the general
remarked when discussing the subject,
there was the question of expression.
"You see, he was a soldier, a sailor
and an administrator," said "B-P.,"
"and it's rather hard to give hints pt
those three different callings in one
lace." '

LONDON, Oct. 29.â English curio
dealers have discovered a clever method
of enhancing their profits by stimulat
ing competition between Lord Iveach.
the wealthy " Dublin "brewer, and J.
Pierpont 'Morgan. Both are notorious
ly good judges, and great buyers of
such articles, and the dealers usually
obtain a higher price from them than
from any of their ottter customers. It
is a common trick In the trade to clay
one man against the other when any
rare or . interesting specimen in an
tique, furniture or old tapestry is on
the market. The dealers will, in a con
fidential way, ; offer the article to Mr.
Morgan, assuring ', him that there is
very little doubt Lord Iveagh would
snap it up immediately it was submit
ted to him. "At the same time a com
munication identical in tone is sent to
Lord Iveagh advising* him to secure
the rare, specimen before" it is offered
to Mr. . Morgan. Patriotic considera
tions, they state, always prompt the
dealers when ' offering articles . to Lord
IveaghT. while Mr. Morgan is assured
that his generous patronage of .their
establishment cannot really be f orebt-
An hour - afterward Mr. Morgan re
turned and was told that Lord Iveagh
had made an offer v and 'was comlnsc
again that evening. Mr. Morgan had
the articles packed immediately, paid
his check and departed. .
ten when a good article is groin? cheap.
There is no doubt about it the meth
od has succeeded in causing the mil*
lionaires to compete keenly with each
other when a -really genuine article is
to be secured. One day the two men
happened to be In a well known curio
dealer's place in Bond street at the
Fame hour. They were not aware of
each other's identity, although the rep
utation of the one as a 'Judge of bric-a
brac was well known to the other. Mr.
Morgan left without, making a pur
chase, and when he had gone the dealer
handed down several articles to Lord
Iveagh for Inspection, informing him
at the same time that they had been
seen by Mr. Morgan, "the gentleman
who has just gone out." Lord Iveagh
eyed the dealer â¢ keenly and remarked
that If they had been worth purchas
ing at the price asked Mr. Morgan
would not have left them behind. Lord
Iveagh would not m-'-<> an offer and
left the shop. too.

LONDON. Oct. 23.â Captain John
fSmlth, hero of the Pocahontas yarn
and of many another adventure quite
as exciting and better substantiated,
has a direct descendant living In Eng
land, who Is xrfre famous to-day than
the doughty captain was when he set
out for that memorable trip to Vir

descendant is none other than General
R. S- Baden-Pywell, over whose suc

to the winds and danced hornpipes in
the Strand.

any one not placed In a commanding
position in the order/ She has made
herself familiar with all the details of

as well as the ladies' branch, and in
the eighteen months she has acted as
assistant to her father in the office of

' ]: Deprecating others ; will not hÂ«h> * the
world to appreciate you.'
Why, we simply are not old enough,
nor broad enough as yet, to admit. the
authoritative supremacy of . any 'one
man, or group'of men â but we will, as
we grow, for wisdom comes only with
years, "and then only when mellowed
with Intelligence. And may we of the
West hasten to acquire the necessary
blessed intelligence, for the cultivation
of which' I can recommend, no (better
school . than frequent visits â¢' to the
studios and the reputable galleries that
now abound in our cosmopolitan town.
Another fact came home to me
strongly by, Dr. Genthe's chat, and it, is
this: That in California there is an
absence of acknowledged competent
criticism. Where are Mathews, Keith,
La timer. Â¦ Peters, Dickman ,and a half
dozen others whose opinions are worth
while? . 8g$9B
Besides, the remoteness of California
from art centers is a strong element in
the development of individualityâ and
herein lies the dominant note of suc
cess, not only of art, but of all pursuits.
And thus it is that the progeny of the
gods â they who see the things that the
God of nature hath given to California
âput on" canvas the emotion that has
seized them, and thus it is that Cali
fornia artists â yes, and writers â are
sounding a- new note to the world, and
the cry is clear, Individual and Cali
fornian.
Italy was the birthplace of art as we
of to-day know itâ there painting:, sculp
ture and architecture took its noblest
form, hand in hand with art In let
ters. And it is "an indisputable fact
that California/ offers the same glad
ness, the same sadness, the same
moods of laurel-wreathed Italy, the
same sunshine, the same turquoise
skies, the same purple hills, the same
blue bosom of sea. studded with em
eralds. â¢
deavor must come success, for God
hath graciously given us the great ele
ments that make for artâthe highest
expression of his handiwork.

again, the theater is most "desirable,
and the atmosphere of the college Is
distinctly conducive to dramatic
aspiration. Still, even considering
these things, "the Dante" reflected ex
traordinary, credit on the ingenuity and
intelliRer.ee of the prqducers.
The play well serves its avowed pur
pose of a truthful (though limited) pic
turing of the poet's life. As a "drama,"
however, it leaves much to be desired.
The probable circumstances of its
production by students, and by only
main students at that, necessarily
somewhat limited Father O'Conor in
his dramatic, scope. He has \ shown
Dante as the poet; as one of the priori
of Florence, honored of his native city;
as exile in Rome, flouted of his political
enemies; among his visions; as hunger
ing after many : years for his beloved
Florence, hut rejecting her insulting in
vitation to return; and then at his
death at Ravenna. With the scene in
the Council Chamber, where the
Bianchi and Nerl factions draw swords
one upon another, and the fight before
the Cardinal's palace in Rome, almost
the only opportunity for action occurs,
though the incidents of the dream
visit to the inferno suffice amply to
hold . the attention. (One wonders
how now Dante would paint his hell!)

But the play was not grateful ma
terial for students to make anything
of, and their work is all the more to
be- commended. .That of James Baci

The amateurs, with the production of
"Dante," a play by the Rev. Father
J. F. .X. O'Conor, presented by the
members of the Gentlemen's Sodality
of St. Ignatius, have been well to' the
fore this week. Asa scenic production,
with its elaborately pictured Inferno,
one could only praise the "Dante.", It
was indeed a quite remarkable amateur
effort. The students are very fortunate
in their theater at St. Ignatius College.
The stage is " large . . and .', excellently

everything In its favor.
teur difficulties are enunciation, enun
ciation and enunciation, pronunciation
and gesture.. The Virgil and Dante
were good on all counts, though the
Dante "furrst" offended, perhaps more
seriously from its scholarly context.
The burring "urr" for "er" as In
tain," "ir" as in "Virgil," "ur" as in
"church," "or" as In "world" â giving
"surrtain," "Vurrgil," "churrch," and
"wurrld" â was Indeed the most notable
offense against good pronunciation that
obtained. It is everywhere. , Some of
the minor characters, again, from lack
of articulatlve effort, were frequently
unintelligible. But so, frequently, are
their professional brethren. And, as
Mr. Bacigalupi and Mr. Churchill
might fairly be found not wanting from
the professional viewpoint, the others
dignified and reverent in attitude, and
the setting indeed excellent, the per
formance was one to arouse consider
able respect.
Perhaps Heir Conrled is wise in his
estimate of our capacity â a pocket ca
pacity, purely, no one at this day ven
turing to limit the local appreciation
of good music. He may possibly find,
however, that Christmas, Gadskl, Mel
ba. Ysaye, d'Albert, Fritz Kreisler,
Franz de Vecsey, David BIspham, De
Pachmann. the Dolmetschs, the Kneisel
Quartet, Creatore'ff Band, the Savage
Grand Opera Company and a possible
short season of grand opera at the
Tivoliâ all of which come within four
months! â may not have wholly de
pleted the local treasury. In that case
we may get another of the three weeks
originally planned for us.
But it is a thousand pities that the
season could not have taken place at
this time, as the last two were dated.
Some of the above enumerated attrac
tions, almost all of first magnitude,
must necessarily suffer from the con
gestion of the programme. And -it will
not be our fault. The Metropolitan
Chief among the women artists
known to us here will be Nordica,
Sembrlch and Eames, a brilliant trio,
.and there will be several new people.
Altogether it looks as though we might
make out! The company comes In

Week, and of course to the Grand

Herr ,Conried has decided that one
week of. grand opera is as much as we'
may have next* 'spring, so Mr. Schlot
terbeck, his agent, informs me this
week. A brilliant week he promises us,
however. "Parsifal," certainly," "The
Marriage of Figaro" â¢ most probably,
and very possibly "The Magic Flute"â
all productions of intense interestâ will
be in the repertoire. Verdi, also, may
be represented. Caruso, at whose name
women turn up adoring eyes, will be
the star novelty among the singers.
He Is freely compared with Jean de
Reszke, with the favor coming fre
quently his way.
Burgstaller, who will be the Parsi
fal; Anton von Rooy, who will be the
Amfortas, and Plancon and Saleza are
among the other male singers.
There is a thoughtful manager in
town this week. John C. Fisher. It is
"San Toy" that has set him thinking.
Mr. Fisher is the now celebrated dis
coverer of "Florodora," founder of
"Ghosts" and "A Doll's House" are
contemplated. The Spanish school may
also be exploited, in the plays of Jo9e
Echegaray and Angel Guimera. Oscar
Wilde's plays are among other possi
bilities. "Gretna Green," and "We Are
Kins'" â a play nf the fashion of "The
Prisoner cf Zenda," are modern novel
ties to be given, with "The Little Prin
cess" as played at the Children's
Theater in New York as particular
tidbit. Then such plays as "An
American Citizen." shortly to be put
on 1 , we shall always have with us. and
Mr. Morosco smilingly threatens an
other "Taming of Helen." The com
pany has Just scored heavily In the
latter play in Los Angeles, and Mr.
Morosco modestly challenges com
parison with the Henry Miller produc
tion of it here. In fact Mr. Morosco is
very proud of his companyâ and has
much reason to be.
Ibsen dramas and a good many other
notable adventures are on the Majes
tic programme. Their company makes
possible their essays into the legiti
mate. "Hamlet" this week, "The Mer
chant of Venice." and "Richelieu" be
ing early offerings. Of, the Ibsen genre
productions cf "Hedda Gabler,"
A company to match, the theater Is
the pretty high record that the last
â¢week has made for the Majestic As
every one knows, the Morosco and Ma
jestic stock companies have been con
solidated, and with the above pleasing
result. They will now proceed to make
h!story at the uptown house.
Last week's "When We Were
Twenty-One" is a strikingly good be
ginning. Miss Gardner and her fas
cinating personality, that clever youth
Harry Mestayer and Howard Gould
have all importantly helped. I wonder
If Miss Gardners Ideal qualifications
tor Candida have suggested them
selves to any of her admirers? I sug
rested them modestly myself to Arnold
Daly when he was here. Further ac
quaintance with her work confirms me
in the conviction of ' her fitness. Like
Bernard Shaw's heroine. Miss Gardner
Is essentially the "mother woman." in
earlier bloom than Candida, true, but
of the radiantly wholesome, sunny,
canÂ© atmosphere of the type, and
physically exquisitely what the part
demands. As to her quality of intel
ligence, this week's Phyllis, and a Mrs.
Alving in 'Ghosts" to whose power
Los Angeles bears astonished and elo
quent witness, represent the range and
kind of it. There should be a Candida
somewhere between the two.
Harry Mestayer was the Oswald of
"Ghosts"â not at all "by the way."
One remembers Claus Bogel's powerful
portrait of OFwald on the solitary oc
casion of the play's presentation here,
and those that have seen both com
monly prefer Mestayer's. He was with
Mary Bhaw, the most famous of the
Mrs. Alvings. in her recent much
talked-of production of the play in the
East. It is on the cards to produce it
locally some time in January.

numbers are new here, the Binding
quintet is given by request, and when
does one not want Mozart? The
Kopta quartet concerts are gratefully
remembered from last rear. The en
scmbled sympathy evinced in their
work was even remarkable in a newly
formed organization. That, of coarse,
should be much more radically in evi
dence this afternoon. As last year
Wenzel Kopta leads, the accomplished
"Johnnie" Josephs takes the other fid

pable viola, and Adolph Lada handles
a "cello delicate and discreet. Assist
ing at the piano win be Mrs. Oscar

it is strongly within the local musical
heart to do honor, to all of the great
people who honor us by coming here.

however!â has foregone Its usual sea
son of Italian opera. Truly, we hare
managed things better before.*
And this does not close the list for
1904-1905. Fritz Scheel is planning &
season of symphony, with RICHARD
STRAUSS at the baton.* to end It!
Well, If the rent man will wait a year
or two, and we take to beans and our
heels, we can gorge our souls this sea
son. I don't say it is not worth while.
Two of the people at leastâ besides
Straussâ promise extraordinary satis
faction, Fritz Krelsler, ,-^he violinist,
who seems to have arousecl the kind of
exalted admiration that Harold Bauer
excites, and D" Albert, whose planism
is In the s4-fae noble class. Krelsler
made a recent appearance in London.
Two things Mr. Fisher is proud of,
his discovery of "Florodora" and the
fact that everything he sends on the
road is "as good to a dot" as its met
ropolitan production. One subscribes
most heartily to the latter opinion,
with the "San Toy" of the week,
stuffed with good comedians, and
"Jimmy" Powers, dressed and acted to
perfection, to back it. "Florodora" is
another good story. Every big man
ager in America, including Frohman.
Klaw & Erlanger. Kirke La Shelleand
Al Hayman, refused the piece. Fisher
made $300,000 out of its first twenty
weeks and he boasts that there were
people in "New York who saw the
thing 200 times! His own record is
700 times and not tired of it yet! That
was his first venture, and interesting
things may further be expected from
Mr. Fisher, who Is a most interesting
and genial person. "Glittering Glo
ria," that the Columbia will put on
to-morrow night, is the next Fisher
offering here. '-â¢?-?
There is a growl in order from the
Tivoli, though I haven't heard one
yet. A three-week run for a piece
like "Der Rastelbinder" reflects little
credit on local musical judgment. It
is one of the prettiest comic operas
ever staged here and staged in the
Tivoll's best fashion. Musically, noth
ing more worthy and attractive has
been heard for a long season, and the
story, while without the sparkle and
lightness of a Gilbert and Sullivan
opera, is yet taking and., interesting.
Most delightful again is the perform
ance. Edith Mason as the bashful
Suza, Thomas Persse, Kate Condon,
Dora de.Fillippe, Wlllard Sims, Schus
ter, Teddy Webb, Ferris Hartman. and
not to forget Harold Forman, the boy
singer, give an excellent interpreta
tion of the piece. And for Paul Stein
dorff, who has so successfully directed
it, and Ferris Hartman. who has so
well managed it. nothing but highest
praise is due.
And yet, and yet, we support "Der
the Fisher Opera-house in San Diegt),
manager of "San Toy." "Glittering
Gloria" and "The Silver Slipper" this
season and incidentally one of the
most generous producers in the musi
cal comedy field. Mr. Fisher Is won
dering: why "San Toy" has not "tak
en" "better here. Press and public
have praised the piece unanimously,
but have not crowded to see it It
must be remembered that Mr. Fisher
is used to making his Â¦ $300,000 in
twenty weeks, as he did at "Floro
dora's" first appearance in New York.
Still there is warrant for his won
der. The "business." considering: the
quality, of the attraction, has not been
of the best, though good. Crowded
houses, beginning with New York â
where John Malone, producer for
George Edwardes, who first put on ihe
piece for its two-year run in London,
testified that the Fisher production
was better than the original â have
met "San Toy" all along the line. Its
manager Is trying to discover what we
want here If not the best of musical
comedy â for such it is. Less election
and fewer musical comedies â for "San
Toy" came at the heel of a glut of
them â would seem to be the only an
swer.

SOCIETY'S LATEST BRIDE AND TWO PRETTY GIRLS MUCH FETED BY THE SMART; SET.
Unique In design and prettily sug
gestive of the promptings of its con
tents is the confession album of 'the
Duchess of Roxburghe. It la heart
shaped and upon each page is a little
heart-shaped pocket, into which can
be slipped a leaf containing a confes
sion. It is kept In her boudoir In
Floors Castle. Of similar design is
the book which serves the, same pur
pose, for the Princess of Pless. > She
keeps it locked and none but herself is
Â«ver intrusted with the golden key
that opens it.
The * Duchess of Manchester has a
confession book made of satin, the
pages of which are beautifully decor
ated with miniature paintings. It is
shrewdly surmised that some oNher
confessions record ebullitions of tem
per over the slowness of British build
ers, which balked her ambition to en
tertain the King and Queen at Kyle
more Castle on the occasion of their
Irish Â¦vfslt
The Duchess of Marlboroush is
credited possessing the hand
somest confession book In England.
Its covering Is of rich Oriental eanvas
and the lettering is in enamel on white
satin. A diamond-studded horseshoe,
symbolical of an alliance between
wealth and good luck, which are not
always found In conjunction. Is at
tached to it by a white streamer. Its
pages are beautifully decorated, but
what it WTitten upon them Is a care
fully guarded secret.
LONDON. Oct. 29.â One of the
latest 'fads in fashionable society Is
the confession album, but the gor
geous character of these receptacles
for the acknowledgment of feminine
stns is hardly suggestive of the sack
cloth and ashes which were wont to
be regarded as evidence of sincere re
pentance in a more strenuous "axe for
the aristocracy.

With the announcement of ' Miss
Nuttall's engagement there comes more
than a passing or ordinary" Interest.
It is not of frequent occurrence that
our society women take up the study
of sciences, neither do they exhibit a
fondness for research, but here we
have an exception. Miss Nuttall has
explored the depths of Aztec wisdom
and resurrected much matter of such
antiquity that fellow-workers have
benefited by her energy. The Nuttall
home In the City of Mexico Is a place
conducive, too, to such thought and
investigation. Its atmosphere savors
of feudal days and the ancient struc
ture Is so filled with relics that it Is
a fitting retreat for the sage mind.

tantes, this is an example to follow
that will take away naught from the
Joys of your teas and dinner dances.
The debutantes, bless them! are up
to their gladsome eyes In the mech
anism of "coming out." Oh! such
roseate phantasies as dance before
their virginal visions. Diaphanous
gowns and floating hats and a million
little things that are as dear to the
hearts of the debutante as the famous

best of all is their exquisite expec
tancy, the radiant Joy v with which

In its voracious maw much that's un
promising. But.euch Is the joy of
youth. Such Is the joy of revelation,
and silence to the tongue that would
put Into leash one strain of the joy
of anticipation!
It is this outcropping of buds each
year that subserves the same purpose
in society that the coming of grass
and blossoms of early spring does for
nature. It revivifies the theory of
eternal growth, keeps the mind re- t
freshed with new, sweet, spontaneous
thought and saves the *ft>rld from
drifting into the dismal swamp of
For pessimism I know of no panacea
so efficacious as a bright-eyed, high
spirited, expectant debutante. And
here's to her! May her reign be one
of triumph; may she win the man
she loves, and may her place give way
next year to her budding younger sis
ter.
But should she be of bachelor bent
here's to her just the same, for her
presence is a happiness and her
friendship worth the holding.
But, bonny maids, beware! Before
you He the unfolded mysteries of life
in its Infinite intricacies and beware
of the false note that lies in it, which
is naught else than sham, vulgar
Cham. Avoid sham in all things and
your career must needs be a success,
for the absence of sham is truth, and
In truth lies happiness and success.

California certainly has good cause to
feel : proud of the educational showing
made here by her. She won as high
medals as any State or nation and as
many as any other, size of exhibit con
sidered. She was given buttwo i>ronze
medals out of all those awarded her in
this department. Her general exhibit
was awarded a grand prize, about
twenty counties contributing. This prize
was for elementary and secondary edu
cation.,
The three grand, prizes won by the
University of California, made ; the
State's ; list of .trophies look pretty Im
portant. These big scalps v were for the
general exhibit, the Lick Observatory
exhibit, which Jias attracted the atten
tion of scientific men" from all over, the
world, and the mining college exhibit.'. .
In elementary 'work gold medals
were taken by %*he San Francisco
Board of Education, Sacramento
Board . of Â¦ Education and the Chico*
Los i Angeles, : San Diego, San Fran
cisco and San* Jose normal schools.
A gold medal was awarded the
traveling library as used in California,
an exhibit of the State library at Sac
ramento. â¢
In secondary, education gold medals
were awarded the cities of Oakland.
Pasadena, Stockton, San Francisco
and Los Angeles.

cities of Fresno, Sacramento, Berke
ley, Santa' Cruz and San Diego, to the
norniar schools of San Francisco and
San Jose, the cities of Los Angeles,
San Diego and. Chico and the Kern
County Board of Education.

medal as collaborator, the exhibit be
lng entered In the name of the State
EDUOATIOXAIj PRIZES.
"The other California exhibits are a
credit to the State, arid in education
especially we, . are well represented,
which is a good thing for the growth
of the State. We don't make much of a
showing in the manufacturers* building,
but will be able to in future years."

CALL. BUREAU, WORLD'S FAIR,
ST. LOUIS, Oct. 29.â The president of
the ' California State Board of Trade,
General ; N. P. * Chipman, indorses the
showing made by California at ".the
World's Fair, and says the State la cer
tain to obtain excellent results from It.
"The display made" by the various
counties in the Palace of Agriculture la
magnificent," said General Chipman. "I
have been observing '-California's dis
play here carefully in order to . make . a
report to the Board of Trade, and I can
make a most favorable report. The ma
terial shown by the counties is well se
lected and handsomely | displayed. I am
satisfied that this exhibit is attraotlnff
a great deal of attention and that its
effect will be apparent in time to come.
The ' attracting of I new settlers . Is not
the only end" to be attained by it. The
exhibition of our products In such a
tempting manner draws attention to
them and makes new customers. 'The
developing of markets Is one of the
most important branches of promotion
work.; *.'^,C- .;Â¦â¢'Â¦; 'Vi'' : - r .''.â¢:
"The Thursday bef ore last . we were
all sick after taking our breakfast and
; It was something that had been put in
; the milk. I . know this because Mrs.'
Jackson tasted a cup of black coffee
' without milk and it was all right. The
: other coffee with the milk in it had a.
nasty taste. I was awfully thirsty for
two or three days after that. I no
ticed at the time that the bottle was
only half full and the paper that is
always on top of the bottle" was not
theFe. Why should I try to poison the
family? I was very fund of the.chil-1.
dren and Mr. and Mrs. Jackson were
kind to me. I did nÂ«it need to "steal
either, as I have | a. good home with"
my married sister and" it .was not nec
essary for me to -work, but; 1.^ just
wanted to make some- money, for my
self. . v ; Â¦'Â¦"â¢;; ' . :
"Last Wednesday evening I found a
bottle of carbolic acid in my room and
when I spoke to 'Mrs. Jackson about it
she told me to - put it In the medicine
chest. The next morning I found; two
empty bottles marked carbolic acid
and/ a bottle marked ijoison in the ash
barrel." Â»
The girl accounted >_f or the carbolic
acid marks on her clothing by stat
ing that last Sunday evening when
she went home she suffered with
toothache and in using carbolic acid
to stop the pain some of- it was spilled.
In this statement she was corroborated
by' her sister, Mrs. James A. Murasky,
who called to see her at the City |
Prison yesterday afternoon.-' Mrs.
Murasky said that the lounge on which
Rose was sitting when she used the
acid Is marked with it.
"ALWAYS A GOOD GIRL."
" "I don't know what to think. of .this
dreadful affair," said Mrs. Murasky.
' "Rose has always b^en a good girl.
The girls have lived v/ith me for. many
years. They have'al.ways had a good
home and there was'-, no occasion for
Rose' to work, but ; she wanted to
make some money- for herself. She
has been keeping company for years
with a young man and he always used
to bring her home at night. ' There Is
something In this case that I cannot
fathom. I do not believe Rose stole
the things or that she tried to; poison
the Jacksons. . It is all a horrible mis?
take. My husband is a cousin of
Judge Murasky, but he has been;un
able to see the â¢ Judge,* as he Is busy
with the coming ; elections. We will
employ a lawyer and I hope the truth
will soon come out. Rose ; has never,
acted as If there was -anything wrong
mentally with her, but has "always
been bright and happy. Mrs. Jackson
told me that she .would not take any
steps against her and that she had
every confidence In her."
AJjIi TAKEN SICK.
The^ case of Rose Holsworth, the
servants girl charged with, stealing
articles from her employer, Harold P.
Jackson, 2658 Market street, and at
tempting: to poison the family by\ put
ting carbolic acid in the household
milk, is puzzling the police. The girl
talks sensibly enough, but the acts of
which she is accused are so extraordi
naf y that the conclusion has been
reached that she is mentally Irrespon
sible. She will be sent to-morrow
morning \p the Central Emergency
Hospital to be examined by the In
sanity Commissioners.
The girl persists in her denial of
having stolen the pongee silk coat,
skirt and bicycle belonging to Mrs.
Jackson. She also denies having put
the carbolic acid in the milk. She said
yesterday morning: "I am sure some
man robbed the house. I had $20 of
my own money that I had savedâ a
110 gold piece, a $5 gold piece and $5
In silver â stolen at the same time,
with the exception of .65 cents, which
I found on the floor. Â¦ * The reason I
went with the little girl out the Ingle
side road was because on Sunday even-
Ing I saw a woman going along that
road carrying a bundle and I followed
her out of curiosity, v&ext day I took
the little girl with mÂ«i to see where
the woman had put tha bundle. Mrs.
Jackson gave me a dollar for finding it
and Hlldegarde got 10 cents/ Two
days bef ore the house was entered the
baker's dog was sick" and It was
thought some one had given it poison.

Alameda, Cal. The following is given
as the method for making a hekto
graph that, if allowed to remain for
two days after using, will not need
washing, but will absorb all the ink
and not interfere with the making or
a new transfer: Soak an ounce of good
gelatine over night in enough cold
water to cover it well, taking care that
all the gelatine is swelled.. Prepare a
salt-water bath by dissolving /two
ounces of common salt in a pint of
water. Heat seven or eight ounces of
glycerin over the, salt- water bath; to a
temperature of 200 Fahrenheit, then
pour off from the gelatine ail the
water remaining", unabsorbed, add the
gelatine to the hot glycerin, continuing
the heating for an hour, carefully stir
ring the mixture 'occasionally, avoiding
as much as possible the formation of
bubbles. Finallv add twenty drops of
the oil of cloves to prevent decompo
sition. The composition Is then: ready
to pour into shallow tins in which It Is
to 'be! used. ' After the tin is filled it
must remain in a level position, for at
least five hours, in cool place before
using for the pi'-pose of making trans
fers.

JUDGED by what appears in our always able and sometimes ami
able contemporary, the Colusa Sun, that fertile part. of the
Sacramento Valley is the only place in the United States where
the campaign is above blood heat. Indeed, it would appear that" a
fever thermometer would lose its quicksilver, by running out at the
top, if it were put under the political tongue of old 'Golusa. The
Sun shines vertically up there, and-every beam ' is : a^ blazer. In a
recent issue that paper says: "The white people of the South were
trying to do all in their power to elevate the. standard of negro in
telligence. But Mr. Roosevelt comes in and- tells them the}* must
take the negroes in as social equals; orders them what they must 'do."
Really that is so bad that we must call for a bill- of; particulars.
We want the text of that order and the exact language in .which the
President told them to make the negroes social equals. President
Jefferson, the father and founder of. the- Democratic party, had a
regro to dine with him, and the. Democratic; party, ran a candidate
once for" the" Vice Presidency who: had a negro .wife and a large
family of mulatto children^ If he had become : President a negro
woman would have been the mistress of the White House and the
first lady of the land. Wouldn't that have made. Colusa^ torrid?
But what is the wisdom of being foolish? Why imagine vain
things?. President Roosevelt has done none of the things imputed to
him. He accepts, as all sensible men do, the declaration of Booker
Washington that the negfo is not thinking of social. equality and
does not desire it. What he needs is. recognition of: the "fact that he
is a human being and entitled to the natural rights that belong jto
men. Social distinctions are artificial, even among white* people,.and
they are equally- artificial among .negroes; and; are-just: as much"'af
fected by race and color. . â¢ ,*
If our venerable friend of. the Colusa Sun wait to receive a negro
on terms of social equality by order of President' Roosevelt?; he Twill
have longer life than his fondest friends have wished for; him. IWe'
implore him to refrigerated little. Itis not good f6r>the"blood to
get so hot. BpBBWBMBWBBHe: .

university, and further sought to have the annual State appropriation
for the support of farmers' institutes advanced from $6ooo to $io,
ooo to meet the increasing needs of the service. â._. â¢
This appeal of representative agriculturists from all over the
State merits consideration by the Legislature, for it directly concerns
immediate needs of the greatest of California's industries. The agri
cultural college over at Berkeley, which has come to take the position
of mentor in "questions of scientific farm practice and .initiator ' of
hew ideas for producers the State over, has so far* outgrown the
limits of its earlier province as' to be seriously handicapped in the
work" of properly training its students' and carrying on original in
vestigation along experimental lines. At present time isolated sheds
and even an unused barn have been pressed into ajrvice to accommo
date the'great bulk of work that has come upon this department of
the university. A new. building, adequate to present needs and de
signed to permit of the introduction of instruction in new and im
portant courses, is a crying need.'
The work that has been done by the farmers' institutes in the
past is sufficient argument for the need of increasing this sphere of
the university's activity. At present time regular instructors in the
agricultural department are forced to divide their time so largely be
tween classes at Berkeley and institute' work in the. field that the
aims of their joint endeavor are accomplished, with difficulty only.
Through its work- as ; an agricultural 'experiment station and its ex
tension of instruction through the institutes the department at
Berkeley has made itself invaluable to agriculturists in every: district
in the State. In large measure, has that, class of producers -come to
depend upon the assistance and encouragement of the scientists in
the State institution. Their call for aid represents ah endeavor Ijn
the best interests of the whole State and should be accorded favorable
consideration.

1**HE Russian Baltic fleet ran amuck from the time it left N its
home waters. Its officers were evidently in a panic of fear.
Their condition exposes the spell that is upon them in conse
quence of the warlike spirit, skill, address, and tactics shown by the
Japanese. They believe that their enemy has magical power which
enables him to appear in any sea and threaten them with destruction.
Under the influence of fear the fleet proceeded to fire upon every
ship it met. While yet in the Skagerrack it firqd upon Swedish and
Danish and German merchant ships, and only bad shooting prevented
Â£ tragedy before the British trawlers were encountered and sunk,
and murder was committed on the high seas.
The case is the most aggravated in all history. It defied neutral
rights, violated neutral flags and constituted such' an insult to the
national honor of four nations as to be a legitimate cause of war.
i\Vhen the riot of fear was over and the crazy fleet, finding itself out
of repair in a four days' run, put into a Spanish, port to patch up,
the admiral insulted the intelligence of the world by reporting that
lie was attacked in the North Sea by Japanese torpedo-boats, and
by intimating that they were there by connivance of Great Britain.
Every naval officer knows that if his report were true and the
Japanese boats were there, the Russian admiral would not be above
%vater to tell of it, and his ships would be at the bottom of the
Korth Sea. ...
The whole affair and the lame and false excuse offered for it
would have justified Great Britain in sinking every Russian ship.
But a different course has been taken by the British Cabinet that
is more honorable than a thousand victories in battle. Great Brit
ain consents to an investigation by an international court, accord
ing to the terms of The Hague convention. This makes for peace
on earth and as it is by the assent of a power that could wipe
every Russian warship from the waters of the world, it is an exhibi
tion of national self-control and humanity that puts Great Britain in
the front rank of international peacemakers and friends of the
human race. -:vV ; :
The news of this concession for peace by a power able to make
war is not accompanied by a statement of the constitution of the
court. Under The Hague convention the signatory nations appoint
members of a permanent court, a sort of venire from which an in
ternational jury is drawn, which judges both the law and the facts.
The question submitted is one that it was believed would never go
to that tribunal. It was thought by the members of the peace con
\ention which drew the treaty that questions involving national
honor directly would not go to the court that was created. Rather
it was believed that only indirect and secondary issues, only re
motely involving the honor of nations, would be considered. Among
these would be financial claims, disputed boundaries, the observance
of treaties of commerce, extradition and expatriation, and perhaps
amendment and revision of the international code of war "as formed
by the Geneva convention.
While it is true that many of these issues might be among the
causes of war, they are secondary and not primary causes. The con
duct of the Russian fleet is a primary cause. Great Britain would
have been justified in treating the firing on the trawlers as an act of
war, to be followed by an order to Embassador Hardinge to demand
his passports of the Czar, and immediate reprisal. We said recently,
in reviewing the condemnation of the American naval power by Mr.
John W. Foster, that peace is to be secured only by action- of the
powers that are entirely able to make war. It is for the hawk and
not the hen to make peace. This observation is speedily justified
by the honorable course of Great Britain. But does any one believe
that Russia would have taken that way out of .the 'difficulty had not
Great Britain beert able ,to 'carry resentment to the extent of de
stroying Russian sea power? It is obvious that peace for weak na
tions, and for the world, must come from abstention of the strong
and not in answer to the pleadings of the weak. _>-,Â¦
The adjustment by international arbitration of this primary
cause of war between the two empires is so supremely important that
its' value cannot be overestimated. It forms a. new basis for the
public opinion of the world. Hereafter two nations betw r een which
there is primary cause for military strife will find it practically im
possible to draw the sword until the soothing effect of international
arbitration has been tried. And when tried it is practically certain
that war will be averted.
There may be another more immediate effect. The same public
opinion that this settlement will generate may force an ending of
the carnage in Â£sia to which Russia is a party, and bring about a
settlement of th^war with Japan. The Japanese Government has
kept within reach of such a possibility by strict observance of all of
the few humanities of war. Her summons to Port Arthur to surren
der when defense became hopeless was approved by the world. When
Stoessel refused, the Japanese offer of safe conduct from the be
sieged fortress of women, children and non-combatants kept Japan
in line with the world's conception of humanity and its aspiration for
peace, and again Stoessel's refusal heightened a contrast favorable to
the Mikado.
Let us hope that Great Britain has accomplished a good to the
world far beyond the peacefur settlement of an issue that justified
immediate war.

MEAGER SALARIES.
It may be some comfort to laboring
men to know that the salary "of the
poet laureate of England is $360 a
year and a hogshead of wine thrown
in. Of course, this represents only a
fractional part of what Alfred Austin
really earns; still it is* all that he gets
for being poet laureate to the English
speaking race. This salary is without
any prospect of Â«a raise, although It
was increased to Its present munificent
proportions when Lord Tennyson died.
Some, time before his death it was de
cided to increase his salary to that
amount, but the Government did not
decide till after his death. Thus the
present poet laureate came in for the
raise intended for Lord Tennyson.
Even ' this ' small sum Is more than
the official salary of the Bishop of
Winchester.' in his capacity of minister
to the chapel royal. He receives {35
per annum. It is an office which re
quires'his presence at Windsor several
times each year and the total railway
fares from Winchester amount to
about five times the amount of his
salary." The Vice Consuls of the sec

Through the. new. and important meth
od of correspondence schools the educa
tional influence of Chicago is extending
over -the globe. The .University of Chi
cago has from the start made a special
feature of offering instruction by cpr
respondence in, subjects 'of a university
grade.* Last year 1744 students availed
themselves of - the j opportunity. The
Northwestern' University, at Evanston,
; has within the year adopted the, plan
'and has" a large correspondence school
in ; connection /with it. Probably the
American School of Correspondence of
the Armour Institute of Technology has
the : largest number of students receiv
ing* special instruction by. mail. .-'The
names on their, list exceed 60,000. They
are 'located all over the world, over 1000
being -in New Zealand : alone. One re
markable thing In connection with this
correspondence \work . is -the age of the
applicants.- The average age is between
30 and 40 years. The oldest student in
the Armour ; School' of Correspondence
Is 74 - years. Few - of these ." students
could fulfill '; the requirements f or^ ad
mission to college,, but many of them
do excellent work in their chosen sub
jects. Many of them wish to better
their condition by a change; of occupa
tion; but niore' frequently ; by acquiring
greater proficiency . in their special ; line
of "work? "iv.f'r. :."

younger children -while parents were

cases the plan has been successfully

training Js so; fully recognized by the

city.^ that the graduates of this school
are eagerly sought to fill positions of
responsibility. Manual training, cook^-
Ing and sewing will. soon be introduced
into all of the , high schools â¢ of Chicago.

It is unquestionable that the educa
tional impulses received = by Chicago
from the Columbian Exposition of. 1893
were beyond estimate in extent and
value. The â¢ ublic schools are now
conducted by the people and for the
people, to teach the things the people
want. Pull has been divorced from
the appointment of the teaching force
and the teachers ; are appointed solely
on account of their fitness for their
particular positions. The Board of Edu
cation is- becoming a strictly business
corporation with the sole object^of
spending its JIO.000,000 â¢ of annual ap-,
propriatlons for the ; best interests of

are a feature of Chicago's advancing

English literature and the influences
that have molded it as illustrated by
the works of eminent authors. All of
these courses are given Saturday fore
noons and generally with the heads of
the departments in charge.
The teachers of Chicago are now en-
Joying superior advantages for profes
sional training while carrying on their
regular work. A second gift of Mrs.
Emmons Blaine led to the establish
ment of . what was at first called the
College for Teachers, but is now. called
University College. This is .a down
town ' branch of Chicago University
where classes are given in the after
noon and evening and on Saturday for
the benefit of teachers and others who.
are unable to attend classes in the
daytime. About half of the students
registered there are regular, graduates
or undergraduate ; ~ but the
work is open also to special students.
Another Chicago innovation may ' be
noted in the establishment ; by the City '

class goes out Into the world and Its
members have varying and widely di
verging measures of success. When,
however, the alumni gather at com
mencement on the old campus before
the genius and embodied spirit of the
university they are one in common
brotherhood of the college and the
common motherhood of Alma Mater.
When girls as well as boys and women
as well as men can claim this kinship
and heredity of liberal learning: at
least, and for the first time in cent
uries, there is equality.
A bright woman wrote recently that
women as yet do not find repose In a
club. They gather In groups and talk
in couples, and when one is alone for
a moment she frantically plunges for
the first group, whether she is wanted
there or not. She has not got over the
sensation that a woman who stands
alone la a wallflower and one who alts
alone Is ostracized.

INTER DENOMINATIONAL
peace is an essential condition in
the progress of civilized society.
All interpretations of religion
tend to the uplifting of the
masses and the introduction of
moral agencies whereby the value of
life is enhanced, and to that extent
the seal of divinity rests upon every
manifestation that exhibits the un
doubted relationship of God to man.
Interdenominational peace has rarely
been disturbed in San Francisco.
The churches and synagogues have
not been passively tolerant of each
other; nor have they labored under
the restraint imposed by the absence
of state recognition of either church
or creed, but, under the guidance of
large hearted, generous and pro
gressive leaders, they have recognized
the universal mission of religion and
the absolute necessity of- translating
that mission according to the tradi
tions, the genius and theological
foundations of each of them. We
have always sought to emphasize the
points of agreement in our religious
mischief bears ripe fruit.
Religious amity should and must be
maintained. We must honor and re
spect each other, no matter by what
name we invoke God; no matter how
we are trained to think of him. We
must recognize /the ; capacity of each
church and denomination to : promote
the happiness of society, to raise it to
moral and intellectual heights, where
divinity is easily accessibleâ riot the
far distant, incomprehensible being
whose abode is on the summit of un
scalable mountains or in the infinite
distances, too far even to be bridged
by human thought. Human love
brings divinity straight to the homes
of mankind; human prejudices and
hatred would prove that God is 'far
away, even "from the most gorgeously
adorned altars. The love of man for
man is' the strongest evidence of the
existence of Deity; the hatred of man
for man is the rankest atheism with
which society can be afflicted. The
man who, boasts of his infidelity is
harmless in comparison with a church
that seals its sweetest faith with per
secution and fanatical insistence upon
its exclusive selection. The spread of
religion and pure morals is not so
systems, and rarely pressed the points
of divergence, wherefore it has come
to pass that there is religious" amity
in San Francisco, and we have rarely
been harassed by those unfortunate
religious controversies which bring
church and religion into disrepute and
cast dishonor upon the name and the
glory of the living God.~ *
All churches should strive to main
tain this religious amity. Controversy
is perversive of social peace, and no
prejudices are so dangerous as those
generated by churchly wars. Creeds
striving for supremacy by other means
than the force of conviction have ig
noble i ambitions behind them, . and
while these in the end must defeat
themselves, the warfare- they have
caused lacerates the hearts of the
pious and well intentioned and opens
the door not merely for sectarian
hatred, but for the ridicule of the im
pious, the scorn of the scoffers and
the skepticism of the thinkers. When
religions are at war God weeps and
the devil grins his broadest. Mephis
topheles is never so happy as when
much hindered by l the social evils
that, like rank weeds, spring up in the
richest soils, as by its own agencies.
If the " methods pursued - to save so
ciety, breathe passion and contention;
if the emblems and symbols of faith
bristle with daggers of hatred that
stab sentiment to* death and make the
Christian attributes a laughing stock
among those who since the beginning
have proclaimed God to be a fiction ;
if revealed religion ' prescribes and
persecutes man is justified in saying
that God is the offspring of disordered
brains; if religion . saves and .. helps/
brings peace among men, teaches the
true, good and the beautiful, becomes
the pre-eminent factor in the creation
of _ every reasonable condition of indi
vidual happiness, then atheism may do
its worst, for the world will be God's
world and every kingdom will be his
kingdom.
Whatever we believe religiously can
only be enhanced in spiritual value by
our respectful and reverent attitude
toward other beliefs, and to that ex
tent that we refuse to recognize the in
tegrity and divine call of other faiths,
to that same extent do* we cast reflec
tion and suspicion upon the integrity
of our own.

WONDERFUL CURE BY CUTICURA
"I take the liberty to drop you a few lines to let you know of my won-
derful cure by Cuticura. My head was one mass of scabs and my fore-
head was covered down almost to my eyebrows. . I had to wear my hat all
the time. My legs, arms, and body were covered with spots in size from
* pin-head to as large as a silver dollar. A white, crusty scab would form
and itch, and words cannot express how* I suffered for fifteen years. I
tried many doctors and all kinds of .treatments, but could get no help,
and thought there was no hope for me. While in Michigan last summer
& friend told me to get Cuticura. I got a. cake of Cuticura Soap and a box
of Cuticura Ointment, and in three days my head was as clear as it ever
was. I applied the ointment night and morning, also taking a hot bath
three times a week, and using the ointment freely after the bath. After
using one cake of soap and two boxes of ointment I .was completely cured, ;
without a mark on my head or body. I was so pleased I felt like tak-
ing my hat in my* hand and running down the street to tell everyone
I met what Cuticura had done for me. I shall never use any other soap
but Cuticura. If any one is in doubt about this, they may write to me.

Among. the. causes of Insanity In pa
tients admitted to the London asylums
LONDON, | Oct. 29. â "A total in
crease of 996 lunatics is the largest
annual y increase we have had to
record. .The. prospect of any diminu
tion in the. increase in lunacy appears
to be most problematic." ~
Such is the terrible state of affairs
reviewed in the annual report of the
Asylum Committee of the London
County Council" for the year ending
March. 31, 1904, just issued. The fig
ures given for London alone f show a
total of nearly 24,000 lunatics on \the
first day of, the current year. This,
compared with the three previous
years, shows - an annual increase of
from 700 to, nearly 100.0., In fourteen
years, since : 1890, the number- , of
lunatics has increased by the enor
mous total. of 7590, which is out of all
proportion to the increase in popula
tion. ' â¢ " '=''3^
last year were the following: Intem
perance, 666; hereditary, 783; love af
fairs, 61; domestic worry, 282; re
ligious excitement, 78.
" A well-known specialist ' 6f " mental
diseases, .in- discussing the report,
said: - "It â¢ will be observed that the
largest proportion of lunacy cases is
among the laboring classes. The rea
son is obvious. The depressing influ
ences of the monotonous grind (or
existence in slum and underground
dwellings and intemperance are all di
rect, causes of lunacy. The class which
comes-next on the roll is that of clerks.
Here much the same causes are to be
found.. but in the main I think the apÂ»
palllngly bad feeding Indulged in by
this section of the community has
most to do with the large increase of
Insanity. Hurried/ and insufficient
meals; of starch foods and tea in the
midd*/ of the day. cheap cigarettes and
the general stress of modern life tend
to the unhinging of the mind."
A peculiar feature of the case is the
absence . of anything like intimate
friendship, betwen the two families.
His mother, Mrs. Beresford Melville,
only | went ' for a ' formal â¢ Saturday to
Monday visit .to Cliveden to make [ the
acquaintance of* Mr. Astor after the
engagement was announced.
Astor is a cautious man. He will
allow his daughter Â£10,000 a year for
herself and give. a 'handsome money
present' to; his Tson-in-law. But the
settlement gives the latter no. power
whatever over his wife's money- af

that amount from his mother.

The Republicans have been figuring
on about 70.000 for Parker in the city.
One of the best informed Tammany
Hall leaders has placed his plurality la
the entire city at not to exceed 92.000.
and the plurality of Herrick at not to
exceed 104.000. Other Tammany Hall
men believe Parker will have 110,000

Herrick for Governor may run ahead
of Parker in the city at least 31,000
votes, having a city plurality of 164.500.
IS he does he may beat HIggins in the
entire State by 44,000.
The Call-Herald estimates the plu
rality for Roosevelt in the section of
the State north and west of the city at
about 145.000. This is about 29.000
less plurality than McKinley's over
Bryan in 1900 in the same territory.
It estimates the plurality in the city
for Parker as being probably 133,000
â large enough to iring the apparent
lead of Roosevelt down to 12,000.
HERRICK IN THE LEAD.
The estimated vote for Parker and
Roosevelt in this State shows a dif
ference of oniy 12,000 votes. While
the apparent advantage is with
Roosevelt it should be remembered
that this is a State showing very vio
lent fluctuations in Its voting and any
untoward event might change the re
sult in a day. It is undeniable that
there is now in this city a swing to
ward Parker. Â»$
In New York State the Call and

that Roosevelt will lose the electoral
vote of his own State.

electoral votes are certain to go for
Parker and Davis. A majority of the
electoral college consists of 239 votes.

18 sure votes and Parker and Davis
lack 80 votes of having a clear ma

In the doubtful column are placed
States which cast 60 electoral votes

Captain Joseph of the whaler Call
fcrnlan, which arrived in port yester
day from a cruise in Japanese waters,
Okhotsk and Bering seas, says that a
number of sealing vessels from Japan
about August 1 made a raid on Copper
Island. â¢ ThlB is one of a group of
islands lying to the east of Kam
chatka, generally known as the Kora
mander I3lands. Copper Island, on
the Russian side of Bering Sea, Is to
the Government of the Czar what the
Prlbylof Islands are to the United
States. The islands are guarded by
war vessels, as they are the breeding
places of the. fur seal and subject to
the raids of sealers of air nations. On
thÂ« American side of the sea the seal
poacher when caught Is arrested, fined
and his vessel confiscated. At Cop
per Island the poacher Is shot unless
he can dodge the bullets and outsail
the cruiser that will surely chase him.
When the raiding Japanese in their
vessels drew near the seal rookery one
dark "night, actuated by patriotism
and sealskins, they unfortunately
found the Russian guards wide awake.
Through the darkness and fog the lit
tk- brown sailors in their boats pulled
cautiously to the shore and landed
among the sleeping seals. Armed with
clubs, they began the slaughter. .The
startled animals made clumsy efforts
to escape, and while many reached the
water others were being struck down.
Then the raid was interrupted. The
Â¦Russians had seen the vessels ap
proach, and knowing . the mission of
the crews, they, under, cover of the
fog, secreted themselves . near the
rookery. From behind the neighbor-
Ing rocks they opened fife on the Jap
anese and killed eleven of them at the
first volley.
The raiders were unprepared for at
tack and fled toward their boats, but
the Russians had â surrounded them
and all were captured. At the sound
of the firing the . vessels hurried made
sail to. get out of the dangerous local
lty. The Russian cutter followed them

PARIS, Oct. 2 9. â The correspond
ent of the Temps at Madrid telegraphs
that Akabane Shlro, the Minister of
Japan, had a long conference to-day
with the Minister of Foreign Affairs.
He adds that It is understood that the
Japanese Minister called the attention
of the Foreign Minister to the pro
longed stay of the Russian squadron
at Spanish ports and the facilities ac
corded the Russian ships for reprovis
lonlng and recoallng contrary to the
rules of neutrality. The Foreign Min
ister answered that the other powers
had acted similarly.

herself and all around the port captain
heard of the scheme and sent a cutter
after the Sukno Maru. which was
towed back to Hakodate.
A sample of the reckless patriotism
of the Japanese came to the notice of
the California's people while they were
in Hakodate. The Russian raiding
squadron was In the Straits of Sanger,
not far from the port, and the skipper
of a 118-ton schooner, the Sukno Maru,
prepared to seek and destroy the en
emy. So Captain Itakl rigged two
mines over the bows of his vessel, and
bidding farewell to their families the
skipper and crew put out to sea. His
insane Idea was to bump against some
Russian cruiser, fire his mines and then
all die together. After the schooner
had sailed on her mission of death to
armed, several of the vessels and
about thirty of the sealers were taken.
It is not known what disposition
has been made of the captured raid
ers. Poaching on the seal preserves is
considered nn act of piracy and Russia
deals with those she calls outlaws
with no gentle hand. The deepest
caverns of a Siberian salt mine may
finally hold the seal poachers of Cop

Xo German Protest Results Froni th*"

BERLIN. Oct. 28. â The deferential
attitude of Germany toward Russia
finds a striking illustration in the
press treatment of the case of the Ger
man fishing vessel Sonntag. Most of
the newspapers, while discussing the
L'ritish case at great length, have not
even printed the news that the Sonn

TOKIO REPORTS VICTORY.
"Only two days before the 'North
Sea occurrence the Consul General of
one of the Jmnortant stations -repre
sented here wrote a letter saying that
Demetrios Ivllpos, living formerly at
Patras, Greece, had made the follow
ing statement to the Consul General:
" "Ivilpos shipped as master's cook
from a port in Scotland on .board the
Japanese ship v ltsima. Th^hjjj.came
to Brest, whence she began making
tripa or surveillance of channel ships,
took in the Japanese flag and raised
sometimes the American flag and
sometimes the Swedish flag. Ivilpos,
perceiving that the Itsima was not
upon an ordinary merchant cruise, but
was engaged in a dangerous mission of
surveillance over Russian shii>s, left
the ship at Brest, came here and re
ported to the Consul General, who
reported In writing to the, Russian au
thorities.'
"There is reason to believe that
some of the foresroing details will get
before the International Commission,
and that they will constitute some of
the features of Russia's viewpoint of
the British charges."
Definite details concerning the
meeting of the commission have not
been arranged, but it is the under
standing In France, officially and dip
lomatically, that . Great Britain and
Russia will each make separate and
individual inquiries which will be sub
mitted . to the commission at The
Hague for final adjustment.
The Maritime Registers , available
do not contain the name of the. Jap
anese . ship of, the name, of Itsima,
either steam or sailing.
"A second important point on which
Mr. Balfour's statement creates an er
roneous impression is his saying that
the Russian squadron on Dogger Bank,
was many miles away from .the usual
route-. As a matter of fact, the Rus
sian naval route through the North
Sea is across Dogger , Bank. This is
not the route of the British. and other
navies, but the Russian navy has pre
ferred it because the shallowness of
the W8ter permits easier soundings
for the purpose of locating the posi
tions of the ships. Therefore, instead
of the Russian squadron being far out
of its course, as Mr. Balfour asserts,
it was practically in its right course.
There is no doubt that the Japanese
informed themselves concerning the
probable route of the Russian squad
ron and were aware that the Russian
navel route would take the squadron
across the Dogger Bank.
"As a means of indicating the pre
ciseness of the details reaching the
Russian authorities concerning Jap
anese activity near the North Sea, the
following specific case is cited, which
came to the knowledge of the Rus
sian authorities:
"Mr. Balfour's deduction that Ad
miral Rojestvensky's statement is pure
fancy is based upon the Premier's
declaration that the admiral was look
ing out for torpedo-boats coming from
Japan^. As a matter of fact the Rus
sian admiral was not guarding against
torpedo-boats coming thousands of
miles from Japan, as that would have
been "manifestly absurd: but he was
guarding against torpedo-boats armed
und equipped in the vicinity of the
North Sea. This is not a matter of
speculation or imagination, but is a
matter of fact upon which th* Russian
authorities, have been furnished with
precise details. This information es
tablishes that the Japanese fitted up
craft as torpedo-boats at certain Swed
ish ports, and they also had a large
number of Japanese officers at New
cnstle-on-Tyne and other important
English shipping points for the evi
dent purpose of fitting out craft to ob
struct the Russian squadron. There
fore, instead of these torpedo-boats be
ing imaginary craft coming thousands
of miles- from Japan, the Russian au
thorities possess precise information
that such torpedo-boats were actually
fitting out at points near the North
Sea.
PARIS, Oct. 2?.â The. speech of Pre
mier Balfour- at Southampton last
night has created a decidedly unfavor
able impression in the highest Russian
quarters here, and it is stated by those
in the best position to judge that the

LONDON, Oct. 29.â Lord Lansdowne

final decision was reached. It is be
lieved possible that some British offi
cers may participate in the Inquiry

in its Offer to the Russian embassy to
send a representative to the inquiry at
Hull. The Foreign thoroughly
asrees with the Russian understanding
as to the moral obligation to carry out
the .findings of the international com
mission.
The Board of Trade inquiry is likely
to be opened at Hull early next week,
and will be presided over by a naval
officer, probably Admiral Sir Cyprian
Bridge, assisted by a leading lawyer;
the case being In charge of the solici
tor of the Board of Trade. The inquiry
will be confined to ascertaining ' the
circumstances from the fishermen's
point of view and assessing the dam

reach Pert Arthur before the fortress

General Kuropatkin has now received
sufficient reinforcements to replace the
45,800 men officially admitted to have
been killed, wounded or missing in the
battle of the Shakhe. The hospitals at
Mukden are no longer congested with
wounded soldiers.
General Linevitch is 66 years old, but
is as active 'as a young man and im
mensely popular among the. Siberian
troo'.c", whom he commanded during the
Boxer war. He acted as commander in
chief of the Russian forces prior to
General Kuropatkln's appointment and
arrival in Manchuria.
The first Russian army, which com
prises six Siberian and three European
corps, it now appears is likely to split
up into two sections, one of which will
be intrusted to the command of Gen
eral Linevitch, and the other probably
will form the nucleus of a third army
under General Baron Kaulbars, at pres
ent commander in chief of the Odessa
district. The appointment of the latter
is regarded as certain. General Kaul
bars achieved prominence as Russian
representative in -Bulgaria during the
reign of Prince Alexander. He has the
reputation of being an energetic and
even headstrong commander.
The operations in Manchuria have
acain lulled during" the last couple of
days, the Japanese and Russians ap
parently contenting themselves with
partial successes, the Russians having
captured a couple of villages on the
western flank, while the Japanese car
ried the Buddhist temple on the hill
east of and near to Bentsiaputte. Ac
cording to a correspondent at Mukden

So heavy, however, did Ithe play be
come- on Roosevelt that the odds have
gradually shortened until he has be
come an almost prohibitive favorite at
the rate of 5 to 3, Judge Parker
is posted , at 9 to. 5. A. wager .'.was
made here yesterday that Roosevelt
would have a larger majority than
Governor Toole and more was offered
at an even money proposition, .but: ho'
takers appeared:- "<^MS^^&amS

A word of explanation is due- when"

made by : Senator. Clark, -,, who, "'.."while
addressing Judge ' Parker at : New, York,"
declared^ that v the } labor s party T in con-*

as United States Senator March 4
next, and in concluding the forecast of
the coming election, Governor; Joseph
K. Toole (Dem.) has an" excellent
chance over William Lindsay (Rep.).
Theodore Roosevelt is almost an
idol in Montana. To begin with, he
was an early-day resident of the State,
a member of the Montana Livestock
r Association, the only President to pay
the State a visit, is considered better
acquainted than any of his predeces-.
sors with the wants and needs of. the
West, and, furthermore, his Western
spirit of" "Up and doing" appeals
strongly to the average resident.
His earnest efforts ori behalf of the
national irrigation law have served to
endear him* to Montanans, as water, is
the one thing^needed to' place this
State in the agricultural . list instead
of being known as a mining commu
nity exclusively.
This sentiment finds ample support
in the poolrooms and hotels, where
wagers are constantly being made on
the result At the very outset Presi
dent 'Roosevelt was made a slight' fa
vorite over Judge Parker, supposedly
on the ground that Mqhtaha, eliminat
ing the silver issue, is normally, a Re-,
publican State, as was evidencedtby
the results in the elections . preceding
and following the two Bryan cam
paigns. Â¦ - t
ty.that the undertaking, will prove an
abject failure. . . . "
Two years -ago Joseph M. Dixon car
ried every county in the State for Con
gressman "over Judge Evans. ; His rec
ord at Washington, especially his ef
fc-rts toward securing the } opening to
settlement .of two Indian reservations,
have, to say the lest, not lost him any
votes and- his re-election is regarded as
morally certain. ,
Joseph. K.' } Toole is the* Democratic
gubernatorial nominee and as his ad
ministration has been quite satisfac
tory on the: whole and / his per
sonal! popularity is second only, to that
of President : Roosevelt, with many
warm Republican friends, he will un
doubtedly_.be-re-elected. Another ele^
ment- which seems to foreordain his
successful candidacy is to be found in
his action two years ago, when he com
pelled the Amalgamated Copper Com
pany to resume operations in its mines,
mills, smelters : and , industrial plants,
affecting .25,000 men, before he would
summon the Legislature in special ses
sion to ' pass upon desired ' legislation
whereby it would be freed from alleged
judicial bias.' >'.
The Â¦ present Legislature is strongly
Republican" cm joint ballot and , condi
tions have not changed In two years to
a. material extent." Thomas H. Carter
will Â¦be l 'the i -Republican caucus nominee
for SenaSo'r if the Republicans are suc
cessful, while if the Democrats control,
W. G. Conrad 'â¢ will contest the re-elec
tion of Paris Gibson.

PREDICTS PARKER VICTORY.
"In my judgment," said Senator
Scott. "Roosevelt is certain of 305
votes in^ the electoral college and he
may have 31l/ I do not include Â«n
my estimate the votes of Nevada and
fc'cott of . WÂ«st Virginia, who is chief
of the speakers' bureau at â¢ Republi
can 'national headquarters in New
York showed the President to-day a
poll of West Virginia. He declined to
make public the precise figures of the
poll, but asserted that the Republican
national ticket, would carry the State
by 20,000 or 25,000. Of political con
ditions generally he said the fight is
won.
The result of the inquiries in In
diana was that each canvass showed
the State would go Republican. The
Democratic paper has placed the vote
for Roosevelt over that of Parker at
20,000. Â¦ The Independent paper sup
porting Roosevelt estimated the State
to be Republican. The Call-Herald
correspondent placed it Sit 12,000 for
Roosevelt a week ago and refused to
change his estimate In view of Bry
an'* second tour of the State.
It is a remarkable fact that these
three all came to exactly the
same result in each of the thirteen
Congressional districts. Each corj
respondent gave the number of ./dis
tricts in which the Republicans would
be successful as nine and those which
the Democrats would win as four.
Identical conclusions were reached
In West Virginia and other States in
For the State of Indiana, The- Call and
Herald obtained three polls, made by
experienced men, each working inde
pendently of the others. One poll was
made by & Democratic newspaper
which is supporting Parker, and this
paper has with great accuracy foretold
results in the past. Another was made
the Chicago Record-Herald, which
is an Independent newspaper, but which
Is supporting Parker. Still another was
xn&de by a newspaper man who has
done similar work for The Call and
Herald for many years and whose im
partiality is recognized by Democrats
and Republicans alike.
In Wisconsin two canvasses, each in
dependent of the other, were conducted,
and In each case the official result was
given after exhaustive Inquiries
throughout the State of all elements
possessing familiarity with voting con
ditions there.
In West Virginia the results were as
certained by a representative of a Dem
ocratic newspaper, who has repeatedly
foretold elections in that State, and by
m. representative of The Call and Her
ald who. made the poll for The Call and
Herald in 1900.
POLLS TALLY CLOSELY.
INDIANA REPCBXJCAN.
State en the Presidency and as Demo
cratic on the Governorship. The Call-
Herald Investigation shows a strong
Democratic drift In this city and a
strong Republican drift up State.
All the rest of the States in the Mid
dle West, as well assail of the New
England States, probably will cast
their electoral votes for Roosevelt.
It Is believed Idaho will be carried by
Roosevelt. Montana is placed In the
-column called "doubtful, probably Re
publican." Utah, it Is believed, will
give It3 electoral vote to Roosevelt.
Wyoming is regarded as practically
certain for the Republican column.
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
The Call-Herald estimate on the
House of Representatives gives these
totals: Republicans, 210; Democrats,
164; doubtful, 12.
The present house stands: Repub
lican, 210; Democrats, 176.
The following is a list of those
whose election to Congress is indicat
ed from California:
First Districtâ J.' N. Gillett
Second District â D. E. McKlnlay.
Third District â J. R. Knowland. â¢
Fourth District â Julius Kahn.
Fifth District â E. A. Hayes.
Sixth Districtâ J. C. Needham.
Seventh District â James McLach
lan.
Eighth Districtâ S. C. Smith.
All of the^e are Republicans.
Nebraska will go for Roosevelt by
a plurality somewhere between 20,000
and 50,000. There is really no fight for
the Presidency in that State. Bryan
has conceded that Roosevelt will carry
it. .Bryan is making a great fight to
win the State Legislature, but the in
dications are that it will be Republi
can and Bryan will not go to the
Senate.
The Pacific Slope States of Oregon,
"Washington and California are span
ned by a great Republican rainbow.
This is due very largely to the policy
of expansion which has been pursued
by the Republicans and. which has re
sulted In such great development of
the resources on .the Pacific side of the
continent.
W'est Virginia, which Henry G.
Davis was expected to carry for Par
ker, is probably Republican on na
tional issues. There 'would be no
doubt about it but â¢ for the. injection
of State issues in the campaign. It is
entirely possible the State may elect a
Democratic Governor and a Democrat
ic Legislature and still give its elec
toral vote to Roosevelt and Fair
banks.
Wisconsin's 13 votes are conceded to
Roosevelt, notwithstanding trie State
factional fight. Â¦ â¢;
In Colorado the trouble with the
miners for a time threatened the Re
publicans, but the indications are that
Roosevelt will carry the State, and he
may be able to pull Peabody through.
Nevada Is a doubtful State. One re
port gave it as probably Republican,
and another as probably Democratic
In view of the fact that the Demo
crats have carried the State repeated
ly since the advent of Bryanlsm, the
State is put in the probably Democrat
ic column.
PACIFIC COAST STATES.
Maryland Is unquestionably . in the
Democratic column. This is due al
most entirely to the race issue raised
by Mr. Roosevelt. . Maryland Is the
only doubtful State in which the Pres
ident appears to be weaker than his
party. s
PARKER HAS MARYLAND.
which there was a double investi&a
tion.
New Jersey Is likely to go Repub
lican on the national ticket by about
half of whatsit 'gave McKInley in 1900.
McKinley*s plurality was 56.00Q. ThÂ«
canvass indicates a Roosevelt : plural
ity of about 27,000. E. C. Stokes, the
Republican candidate for Governor,
may run behind Roosevelt more than
18,000 votes.
Connecticut seems almost certain to
go for Roosevelt by a large majority.
It is believed that nothing short of a
miracle can change the result in the
last few days of the campaign. -
In Delaware a full vote should give
the Republicans the largest plurality
the State ever had. ?'. '

OPERATIONS A FAD.
Public Gradually Awakens to the Fact
The latest fad in operations has been
the appendicitis fad; before that the
fad for rectal operataions (piles, etc)
held sway. Hundreds of patients were
frightened and hurried into hospitals,
oj>erated upon and robbed of their last
dollar, when the trouble was a' simple
case of hemorrhoids or piles only,
easily . cured at home with a simple
remedy costing but fifty cents a box.
"I procured one fifty cent box of
Pyramid Pile Cure of my druggist,
with the intention of buying a larger
box later, but was happily surprised
when r found that I was cured, and
still have six pyramids left out of the
first and only box. I have not had
the least sign of piles since I used this
one box, which has been about two
months: previous to using Pyramid
Pile Cure I had the worst kind of
bleeding and protruding piles for over
thirty-one years, and no one knows,
except those who have had the piles,
the pain and misery I suffered.
- "I aril a poor man, but have often
eald I would give a fortune. If I had
it, to be cured of the piles, and now I
have been cured for fifty cents. " I
should be very ungrateful if I did not
thank you and give you every priv-
ilege to use my name and this letter,

The following .Placer County fruit
growers signed the roll: A. B. Whittier,
Andrew Ryder, J. J. Brennan, H. P.
Markert, Robert Ferguson, J. L. Law,
' -Â¦-The meeting was enthusiastic, and
after Stephens', address and the pass
ing of the resolution it proceeded to or
ganize for the purpose of "promoting,
protecting and defending the interests
of the fruit-growers of Placer County."
-, J. N. Barton of Loomis presided and
J. F. 3Iadden of Newcastle acted as
secretary..
AUBURN, Oct.' 29.â The : fruit grow
ers of Placer County, met torday In
Loomls and took the most decided step
they have taken; in years against the
transportation companies. By a prac
tically unanimous vote a resolution
was passed "opposing the methods
pursued by, the .transportation compa
nies, chambers of corrtnerce and pro
motion- comrnittees in their, efforts to*
induce thousands of Easterners to
come here /or the purpose of investi
gating* fruit-growing." *
V R.',D. Stephens of Sacramento, was
present. In a vigorous speech he said
that the only way to fight an opponent
was to hit him where it hurts, and that
he believed if the fruit-growers would
publish the truth to the worldâ that
there" was no 'money to . be. made in
fruit-growing under present conditions
â it niight bring relief. Our! boards of
trade and chambers of commerce, he
said, -"supported as they were by the
patriotic producer, had simply been
feeding â¢ the transportation companies.

pense, such a woman must surely be
grateful. Well, the Electro-Chemic treat-'

How to Make" a Start.
SALINAS, Oct. 29.*â About ten days
ago Jose Juarez applied to a Blanco
rancher named Bardin for work. He
was employed.; " His duties brought
him to the family residence often.
Last .Wednesday about ;. midnight
Juarez .. secured a large' club, Â» forced
an entrance to the residence through
a, window 7 and- proceeded ito .ransack

BURGLAR ROOM
In addition" to the severe check admin-"
isteredfby the alarming friction be
tween England and Russia an unfavor
able effect was caused by the. poor
quarterly statement of the United
States Steel Corporation. (
Speculative bonds have been most
prominent and have moved in sympa
thy with stocks. . United States bonds
were' unchanged on call.
Individuals and firms are credited
with handling as high as 100,000 shares
of various stocks during a day. Given
to such operators, who buy successively
from each other, each time at an ad
vance in prices, it will be seen that a
constant succession of speculative
profits are indicated, but with the profit
on the whole dependent on the success
of the final holder In distributing his
holdings above his purchase price. Sus
picion of enormous transactions of this
kind was the cause of the tenderness
of the market and the precipitate un
loading of stocks in the rush to save
profits or to prevent heavy losses \\hen
prices turned downward. The dimen
sions of the market are Indicated by a
comparison with the record dealings
for the week ending Saturday, May 4,
1901, which was the week of the com
petitive buying of the transcontinental
railroad stocks which ; led up to the
Northern Pacific corner and the panic
of May 9 of that year. Aggregate sales
of stocks at the Stock Exchange in the
week footed up 15,518,^00 shares. For the
week ending to-day the aggregate sales
have been 9,887,800 shares. Union Pa
cific's prominence this week has 6een
due to the supposition that a plan of
settlement of ' the long-projected com
munity of Interest in the transconti
nental railroads was being worked out.
MANY SHARES HAXDIJED
. The latter factor, coming: upon an
extended speculative situation, caused
an effect in the New York stock market
more acute than in other markets much
more vitally concerned in the outcome,
but t$KÂ» week's results on prices are
mixed, both by reason of remnants of
the earlier strength in the market and
of recoveries after the Anglo-Russian
crisis had passed. The furious specula
tion has centered in Union Pacific, deal
ings ir. * that stock rising above 200,000
chares on' three separate days and to
360,000 shares on Tuesday. The week's
rales of this stock on the Stock Ex
change have been considerably over 1,-
OOO.OOO shares, or as much as the total
outstanding common stock 'of the com
pany, -which numbers 1,087,729 shares.
No one supposed that the control has
passed, the same stocks changing
hands many times in the course of the
Â¦week. The strong side of the week has
offered great opportunities for traders,
and this constant changing of holdings
has been a feature of the trading.
The tone of the foreign exchange
market was slightly easier, b,ut further
exports of g-old next week are general
ly expected; Total sales of bonds, par
value. $5,273,000.
Speculation in stocks this week has
approached the high record level of
activity at times, and with a number
of conflicting factors in force the mar
ket has been' of a tumultuous charac
ter. On the one hand have been numer
sus rumors of railroad deals and on
the other alarming etTect of the
Anglo- Russian crisis, straining the re
lations between Russia and Great Brit
ain by the firing upon of the Hull flsh
in*; fleet by the Russian men-of-war.
NEW YORK, Oct 29.â With the ef
fective clearing up of the threatened
international complications abroad, the
speculation In stocks here broke into
renewed animation to-day, and the
rise in prices was renewed with as
much animation and assurance as with
the opening of the week. There was
no indication that sueh a thing as an
Anglo-Russian war had ever threaten
ed, and the final prices to-day were
In some conspicuous cases the highest
of the week and of the year. The ad
vance was even more comprehensive
and more evenly distributed than in the
market of the earlier part of the week.
Such weakness as was shown was due
t-Â» specific causes, except for the sud
den losses of its gain by St. Paul in
the final dealings, which made the
close slightly irregular and gave the
market an appearance of action be
tween contending fences to determine
the dosing tone. TUe determined sup
port of the forces behind the market
generally prevailed, however, and the
closing -was very animated. Of the
weak spots in the market, that of On
tario and Western was due to the
doubt thrown upon the earlier con
viction that equal terms were to be
offered to majority and minority hold
ers in the purchase of control. The
break in Metropolitan Street Railway
and in Metropolitan ' Securities was
quite clearly a speculation on the pos
tlble future effects of the newly open
ed subway on the local transit traffic
Amalgamated Copper, Sugar, Union
Pacific, Rock Island, Erie and South
ern Railway were conspicuous fea
tures, but the strength was so general
ae to leave no room for detailed speci
fication here. The bank statement
showed the expected small change in
cash, but the increase in deposits
through the loan expansion depressed
the surplus level,

CHICAGO, Oct. 29.â The invasion of
the American industrial field by Jap
anese laborers is feared by President
Michael Donnelly of the Butcher Work
men s Union. To head off the Japanese
Donnelly will introduce a resolution at
the convention of the American Feder
ation of Labor in San Francisco next
month calling for the enactment of
legislation excluding them f ram the
United States.
The matter was brought to Donnel
ly's attention by a call made on him by
K. Okajima, a Japanese who was seek
ing information regarding conditions
in the packing plants. Okajima showed
letters of introduction v to'- the packers,
recommending him as the proper per
son to furnish them with Japanese
labor. He said that he had been told
the employers In Chicago could give
work to 500 or 600 men of his national
ity. Pursuing his inquiries, Okajima
asked if. Japanese would be admitted
to the Butcher Workmen's Union. Don
nelly showed the constitution' of the
labor organization, which contains
nothing operating against the* foreign
ers.

not done by the union,, but by B. Ro

The first musical afternoon of the
Twentieth Century Club for this sea
son was given yesterday afternoon at
Century Hall. A delightful and varied
programme was provided and delight
fully rendered throughout. Mrs.
Gwynn and Miss Heng^tler gave the
Corelli sonata in Q minor, the piano
forte part -constructed upon the
original ground bass by Henry Holmes.
The conception and rendering were
in charming i-ympathy with the
spirit of the composer, and Mr. Holmes"
accompaniment In excellent keeping.
Miss Caroline Little followed with the
Beethoven Bong cycle "An Die Feme
Gellebte." Miss L'ttle has rarely sung
so well. It was thoroughly sympa
thetic in reading and handling.
Bach (prelude and fugue, C sharp
minor,) and Brahms (intermezzo op.
117) were chosen for exploitation by
Mrs. Alice Bacon Washington and read
in sincere and intelligent fashion. Ad
mirably musical were Mr. Alfred Cogs
well's contributions that followed, the
Schubert "WohinVâ a. thought slow,
however, and the "Ungeduld" and the
Beethoven "Ich Lie be Dich." The fa
mous group of Scotch songs . by
Beethoven, given most engagingly by
Mrs. Richard Bavne, closed the pro
gramme â "The Lovely Lass of In
verness," "Bonnie Laddie, Highland
Laddie," "Oh, Thou Art the Lad of
My Heart, Willie," and "Faithful
Johnnie." The songs were given as
originally written, with violin and cello
bbligsto, with Miss Vassault, Mrs.
Gwynn and Miss Puhrer accompany
ing. And it is not often that one hears
better ballad singing.
A wedding surrounded with quiet
simplicity, but one .of much social im

ed _an artistic appearance. The bride,
exquisitely gowned, in: white samite,
was unusually winsome in her bridal
robes, the soft folds and dainty veil
emphasizing her beauty. She carried
Marie Louise violets. Without attend
ants of any order, the ceremony was
impressively performed by the Rev.
Bradford Leavitt, and after the serving
of the wedding supper. Dr. and Mrs.

Claims Right to Express Opinion and

Judse Hebbard will- have. some im

to the righta claimed under the law by
labor unions when he hears , the mo
tion to be made for the modification of
the temporary restraining order grant
ed in the case of Goldberg, Bowen &
Co. against the Stablemen's Union.
Notice of the .motion was flled yes
terday by Henry B. Lister, attorney f or
the union, who contends that the de
fendants have the right to interfere
â¢with or coerce patrons or employes in
all ways; that the law recognises as
"damnura sine - injuria," or .Injury
without damages, and under the same
construction the right to interfere with
business. It â is . contended , also that
the unions have the right- under .the
constitution freely * to ; speak and pub
lish their opinions by banners, 17 pickets,
circulars ; or/otherwise. .

C. C. Moss, accused of having plucked
i.he feathers from live chickens in the
Union Square Market, explained to
Judge Mogan that there 'was no cruelty
whatsoever in his treatment . of the
birds that he executed and dressed. Ere
he began to remove the feathers, he
said, he cut' the jugular veins of each
chicken and also, to make death cer
tain, probed its brain with a- sharp im
plement. The Humane Society officer
who testified that he saw some birds
move after they had been^d^nuded of
feathers by the defendant may have
told, the truth, but "the court 'should un
derstand that for some time after"* a
chicken's life has departed its muscles
and tendons twitch convulsively as
they relax. ,. The Judge confessed him
self unlearned in ornithological anat
omy and continued the case till next
Saturday, by which time he shall' have
consulted experts in the slaughter of
poultry. ' ' . ,
In the breast of Judge Cabaniss is

Braig breathed into his right ear after
he had requested her to state what
little Mary Burane had said that pro
voked Daniel Sweeney (colored) to cast
rocks at her. Daniel testified that he
was walking along one of the 'North
Beach ; thoroughfares, "'tendih' to. his
own bizness ,an* sayin' nuffin'; to no
buddy." when ; the two girls met him
"an* stahted'a-joshin'," and filially, one
of them called him something which
he did not desire to repeat in court; It
was then that little Miss' Braig.whis
pered to the Judge the. offensive sobri-.
quet to* which Daniel alluded and which
the. Judge firmly declined to disclose to
â¢an eager press. Defendant was allowed
to go onPhis own 1 recognizance.

Stockton when Thomas McKenna, re
cently of the Klondike, charitably pre
sented him with river transportation to

gratitude by stealing Thomas' razor

fellow, passengers. Percy denied the
theft and. claimed that the pocketbook
found on his person was his own prop
erty, but Thomas routed the claim by
accurately describing the contents of
the purse, which included a newspaper
clipping announcing the last divorce
of "Swiftwater Bill." Judge Mogan

Edward Bovyer of 132 Caselli avenue,
is building some flats in proximity to
the residence of E. Hill, an inspector of
customs, at 222 Collingwood street, and"
when Mr. Bovyer started to erect a'
scaffold for his painters in tht; narrow
alley dividing his building from the
Hill dwelling an emphatic objection was
filed by Mr. Hill. The unpleasantness
thus engendered was not appeased
when Mrs. Hill complained to Mr. Bov
yer that his workmen kept the alley
wet by maliciously pouring water into
it, nor was the entente cordiale re
stored by Mr. Bovyer's request that
Mrs. Hill "shut her mouth, as she
talked too much;" The lady, of course,
reported to hÂ«- husband what Mr. Bov-
Y.er had said, and Mr. Hill, equally, of
course, went and asked Mr. Bovyer
what he meant by saying "it. In the
language of "Mr. Hill, "one word bor
rowed "another" until words became in
adequate to express j the gentlemen's*
feelings toward each other. In the ac
tive encounter that ensued one of Mr.
Bovyer's fingers was damaged â he al
leged it was chewed by his opponent â
and Mr. Hill's head was severely in
jured. After the draw was declared
Mr. .Bovyer had Mr. Hill arrested for
battery, but Judge Cabaniss thought
"As you have been declared sane,"
was the Judge's response, "you must
be held responsible for your -conduct,
and it is my duty to impose a penalty
in accordance with the seriousness of
your offense."
"Oh, I'm sane â as sane as you j are,"
said Mr. Pilkington, "and J can survive
any term of imprisonment you can im
pose. But again I warn you to weigh
the consequences to yourself. I'm the
last of my race, and by sentencing me
to prison you Will violate the first divi
sion of Magna Charta. New, go ahead."
"Forty days," said the Judge.
Mr. Pilkington gazed pityingly at the
bench and exclaimed: "You have made
a terrible mistake, as you'll soon real
- ize. Pilkington is not ray name. I'm a
knigrhtly squire. Remember, I told you
to go slow. When my vengeance fallsâ
as fall it must in vindication of my
characterâ you'll remember it again."
And with stately stride Mr. Pilking
ton followed the bailiff to the bastile.
Before pronouncing sentence, " said
T. G. Pilkington to Police Judge Mo
gan, "you should weigh the conse
quences to yourself. I may go to jail,
but you'll lose both prestige and money.
Of course, I will not supinely submit to
the humiliation of imprisonment. You
may as well understand that I shall be
avenged. Now do your worst." ;
Mr. Pilkington was arrested for dis
turbing the peace, and when arraigned
he declared himself a British subject,
expressed loathing for all American in
stitutions and informed the court. that
he did hot care a dâ n whether he was
convicted or acquitted. As his demean
or appeared to be incompatible with
sanity he was sent to the Lunacy Com
mission for examination, and that body
of expert alienists said he had sense
enough to realize the effects of any
thing he said or did. So when he was
set ud for sentence he addressed the
bench as hereinbefore quoted.

WHY APPENDICITIS?
Why is appendicitis so common to-
day? ' ,
Because we have got into the per-
nicious habit of eating too fast
Dr. Curtis, the great authority on
this disease, says: "Appendicitis of-
ten follows the eating of a tery hasty,
or particularly large or indigestible
meaL"
After carelessly following a foolish
custom you can" insure your safety by
taking Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets.
It is an accepted, scientific truth,
which admits of no dispute, that if
you will only keep your digestive ap-
paratus in good order you will never
euffer from this dread disease, which,
at best, means a weakening operation,
with long weeks waÂ»d in bed and
big doctor's and surgeon's bills to pay
as souvenirs.
Keep your appendix in health by
the proper use of Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets whenever you have laid your-
self open to danger by overeating and
upon the least sign of stomach or in- I
testinal trouble, for otherwise, at any
time, this dangerous disease may lay
you low.
The curative influence of this great
medicine is quickly shown in the gen-
tle, soothing effect it has on all in-
flamed conditions of any part of the
digestive tract.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets tone all
these parts up -to r(Jproper condition
of perfect health and regulate their
functions into a proper working state.
They also make away with all the
causes of irritation, inflammation or
Indigestion by helping to dissolveâ di-
gest and assimilate or put to priper
use all @/.e food which is lying around
In odd corners of vour digestive ap-
paratus, fermenting, rotting and
curdling, like so much garbage in a
dirty sink. : ,=: .'
liP these natural and perfectly sim-
ple way* Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets
restore all sufferers from any form of
dyspeptic trouble to health.
They^are safe and reliable. They
never f^-il to relieve and cure, quickly
and permanently.
Use them and you need never worry
about your appendix 'V-rmiformix-

vided and resold. The past week has
not brought to culmination any great
transaction, but the buildings that arc
under way represent, large/ values.
Flats are doing as well as they were a
lew months ago. Ample - means . for
reaching the districts west of the ceme
teries make It unnecessary for the; pop
ulation to crowd together under a lim
ited number of roofs, and low prices
for properties, relatively speaking, con
tinue to draw ihome-builders westward
and southward. There is much activity
in the local realty, market- Berkeley,
Oakland, Alaxneda, San Mateo and oth

count of themselves, there being a good
demand for residences especially.

THE VALUE OP CHARCOAL.
Few People Knew How Useful It Is in Pre-
ferring Health and Beauty.
Nearly everybody knows that char-
coal is the palest and most efficient
disinfectant and purifier in nature, but
few realize Its value when taken into
the human system for the same cleans-
ing purpose.
Charcoal Is a remedy that the more
you take of it the better: It is not a
Arae Â«t all, but simply absorbs the
cases and' impurities always present
In the stomach and Intestines and car-
ries them out of the system.
Charcoal sweetens the breath after
r mokin?. drinking or' after eating
onions and other odorous vegetables.
Charcoal effectually clears . and im-
proves the complexion. It whitens the
teeth arid further acts as a natural
and eminently safe cathartic .
It absorbs the injurious gases which
collect in the stomach and bowels; it
disinfects the mouth and throat from
the poison of catarrh.
All. druggists sell charcoal in one
form or another, but probably the best
charcoal ar.d the roost for the money is
in Stuart's Charcoal Lozenges; they
are composed of the finest powdered
Willow charcoal, and other harmless
antiseptics in tablet form or rather in
the form of large, pleasant tasting \o%~
cnges." th*j charcoal being mixed with
,horey.
The dally use of these lozenges will
e oon tell In a much improved condition
of the general health, better, complex-
ion. Â¦â¢ sweeter . breath anÂ«t purer blood
and the beauty of It Is that no possible
harm can, result from their continued
use. but, on the contrary, great benefit.
A Buffalo physician in speaking of
Ike benefits of charcoal says: "I ad-
vise Stuart"* Charcoal Lozenges to al!
patients suffering from gas in stomach
and bowels, and to clear the complex-
ion and purify the, breath, mouth and
throat; I also believe the liver., is great-
ly, benefited by the daily use of;them;
they cost but twenty-five cents a box at
drus Etores, ar.d although in same cense
a" patent" preparation.-, yet I believe I
get rnorÂ« cjad. better charcoal in Stuart's
Charcoal -Lozenges Â¦". than Â¦ in any 'of â¢ the
ordinary charcoal tablets."

The chanting of the "co-ed" will not
cheer the heroic brave to the on
slaught on the day of the big football
pame November 12. The women of
the University of California at a
meeting held to-day declared . against
"rooting" for the wearers of the blue
and gold on that occasion. There will
be no "rooters' "~ section set apart
Xor the representatives of the gentler
sex at the University of California.
The plan to have a separate root
ing section for the women students
originated with Miss Alice â¢ Joy, a
sophomore student, wljo wrote the
prize football song of the year. Her
efforts to give identity as "rooters" to
the "co-eds" upon the occasion of the
big varsity game did not meet with
the approval of her sisters. A special
meeting of the Associated Women Stu
dents was called this . afternoon. . at
which. the disapprobation of the body
was voiced against /such demonstra
tion. Further than attendance at the
game, the women will take no active
part in the play.

Co., 1016 Broadway. Oakland. 1 Tel. , Main 007.*
The matter was discussed by the Ala
meda County Board of Education to
day, and in this connection Chairman
of the Board P. M. Fisher said: *
"This is an important matter to the
high schools of the State. As the law
now stands pupils where there . is no
high school can attend In neighboring
districts free of charge. This, law wa3
passed for fhe purpose of helping pupils
In sparsely settled districts,, but has
been taken advantage of by districts
not within the meaning of the statute.
"To illustrate this,' in our own county
Fruitvale is sending ; Its pupils* to .the
Oakland and Alameda high schools.
Pleasanton is sending its pupils to the
Llvermore schools free of cost. This has
resulted in an. overcrowding. In; the
case of both Fruitvale, and Pleasanton
these districts are fully, capable of
maintaining high i schools of their own,
but are not apt to build them so long
as they can use, those near, at hand."
In order to prevent the high schools
of the State from being overcrowded
by an influx of pupils from districts
where there are no schools of an ad
vanced grade it was decided at a meet
ing of the. County Board of Education
to-day to have an amendment intro
duced in the Legislature to change the
law so that pupils from outside dis
tricts will' have to pay the difference
between what the State contributes to
ward the maintenance of high schools
and the actual cost of conducting them,
which difference is estimated at $85 a
year.

PERSONAL.
The meeting was held in Black
man's Hall under the auspices of the
Fruitvale Republican Club and was
called to order by President E. H.
Marwedel. The affair was one of the
most enthusiastic of the present cam
paign and was largely attended.
last night, when John Aubrey Jones, a
former Democratic nominee for Con
gress against Victor H. Metqalf, in
open meeting declared himself for
Roosevelt and Knowland. He spoke
eloquently of the candidacy of Joseph
Knowland for Congress from the
Third Congressional district and said
that he was glad to be in a 'position
to do all in his power to aid - in the
election of the Alameda man who had
been his friend and one he had ad
nrired many years. The speech Tras
received with cheers. '
OAKLAND, Oct 29. â Impetus rras
given the Knowland campaign at a
big Republican rally held at Fruitvale
' The meeting closed with an address
by Attorney George W. Reed, \ who
represented this district as a member
of the National Convention; that met
at St. Louis and * nominated Roose
velt and Fairbanks. He described
that political gathering and was able
to bear weighty testimony as to the
honesty of purpose and the integrity
ot those who took part *in the man
agement of that assembly.
During the meeting an address was
made bv Justice of the Peace Wil
liam R. Geary in behalf of R. H. E.
Espey, who, owing to illness, had to
abandon an active campaign for a
short time. He has returned, how
ever, physically benefited by rest and
assures his friends he is ready, with
renewed vigor, to enter, the fight for
the ticket. He is a candidate of the
Assembly from the Forty-sixth Dis
trict and it is predicted that he will
win his seat handily and have votes
to spare.

The funeral of Miss Oglio will be
held at 2 p. m. to-morrow from For
esters' Hall under trie auspices of Ver
bano Circle No. 458, C. F. O. A., of
which she was a member.
F. Simpson of San Pablo, to whom
Miss Oglio was to have been married
on Sunday, November 6, is now on his
way to this city and will arrive in time
toattend the funeral. Miss' Oglio' had
no 'relatives in the United States.;ex
cept her cousin, Mrs. - Falettl:* Her
father is dead and her mother lives in
Italy. *
John, E. Carberry, residing at 421
Twenty-second street, who arrived on
the scene just after the car was
brought to a stop, says that Miss
Oglio's body was wedged between the
rear truck and the fender, showing
that the car had passed completely
over her. â¢ -
If Holaday's statement as to the
speed of s the car is true, it is difficult
to understand how the girl could have
been dragged 150, feet after all the
wheels on the inside rail had passed
over her. , ' .
Responsibility for the death of Miss
Stella Oglio, who was killed by a
Shattuck-avenue car last' night at
Forty-sixth street and Shattuck ave
nue, will be determined at the Cor
oner's inquest, which has been set for
next Monday, evening, at 6: 30 -o'clock.
Mrs. Amelia Falettl, Miss Oglio's
cousin, who was with the girl when
she was killed, says that the car which
struck Miss Oglio was at a standstill
at Forty-fifth street when they went
out into the street and that Miss Oglio
and herself were- in plain view of the
motorman, in the light from the head
light of the other car.
â¢ On the other hand, Charles W. Hola
day, the tnotorman in charge of
the car, says that his car was only
running about five miles an hour and
that he did not see the unfortunate
girl until the car was. within a few fee"t
of her, toÂ» late to prevent the tragedy.
Holaday says that he at once shut oft
the ; current and applied the brakes
with all his force.

: "You ; are "a pretty father," she cried,
"to have four children and then act in
this \ way with a â¢ young woman. You
should be- ashamed of yourself, as I am
for you.V Shame on you!"
Angell did not attempt a reply, con
tenting himself with declaring that his
wife was. crazy: to "make such a spec
tacle of herself."
Miss Thompson was taken away, sob
bing X arid declaring I her â¢ innocence '< of
any. intention . to break up a married
woman's home, happy or otherwise. She
resides : at 577 Alcatraz ; avenue and is
employed as a candy gtrl in a Shattuck
avenue store. â¢
"Angell was In charge of a Euclid ave
nue caiv last night and Miss Thompson
met' him ' by; appointment. ' He sent her
a special: delivery letter, unsigned, but
she says she knew it was from. him.
They rode to Stanford place and Addi
son street, Lwhere the car stops to make
a return trip. Angell got off the car to
change-his trolley, and then Mrs. An-_
gell appealed oh the scene. Her attack"
upon Miss Thompson was begun In
stantly, the girl being unable to defend
herself,' so 'swift ] and furious' was the,
onslaught. Quantities of the young
woman's hair remained in Mrs. Angell's
hands as trophies of the combat. V- .
Mrs.' Angell left her home to-day and
neglected to state where she had gone';
Angell -dodged 'all inquirers.; > Miss
Thompson alone stood :. the brunt . of
questioning and frankly narrated the
story of the affair. She alleges having
been Ignorant that ' Angell was married'
and says she intended no wrong when
she 'went to meet him on his car.
Enraged by the \ discovery that ; her
husband had; made an appointment
with a young woman to meet ; him ; on
the street car of which he was conduct
or, Mrs. Charles Angell last night beat
Miss Jennie '-Thompson, ithe offending
maiden, ; and pulled the young woman's
hair until bystanders interposed to pro
tect the helpless girl.
Despoiled of ; her victim, Mrs. Angell
then ; , turned and ; scored her husband
for what she termed his "villainous
conduct." . ' 'â¢Â¦-Â¦'-. Â¦ ' . * Â¦

OAKLAND. Oct. 29.â Infuriated at
what they considered an unwarranted
Interference with their rights, a band
of gypEles encamped near. High street,
in Fruitvale, this afternoon made a
vicious attack upon Deputy Coroner
Henry Quellen when he attempted to
remove the body of Philip Stergue, the
child of a member of the tribe, to the*
Morgue.
Quellen tried to explain the 'case to
them, but the elder members "of the
band refused to listen to him and drove
him from the camp, threatening him
Â¦with death if he attempted to touch the
body. ggg
The boy. who was only 6 years old,
died to-day after an illness of two days,
and as no physician was in attendance
Finding that he could not cope with
the angry members of the band, the
deputy left' a notice that they would
not be allowed to inter the ! remains
until the case had been disposed of by
the Coroner and returned to Oakland,
leaving the body in possession of the
tribe. Dr. Daniel Crosby, who was
called when the child was first taken
sick, said that the boy seemed to be
suffering from lockjaw or spinal men
ingitis.,.
at the time of death the case was re
ported to the Coroner. Deputy Quellen
at once went after the body, but when
he explained his errand to the gypsies
they became greatly enraged, declar
ing that he had no right to take the
body v away and refusing even to let
him examine it. Â¦ â¢'

San Benito County is normally Dem
ocratic to a decided degree, . but bets
are being freely offered at evens that
Roosevelt, Needham and Slaven will
carry the county, and no Democratic
takers are to be had. Slaven, the Re
publican candidate for Assembly, is
one of the most popular young men In
the county and the southern precincts
will go almost solidly in his favor. He
will come up to Hollister with such a
majority that the Democratic prepon
derance in the. city will count .'for. .noth
ing. Slaven has a personality that
makes votes for him wherever he' goes,
and while he has not done much cam
paigning he has .been steadily winning
Democratic vqtes. Tall, straight 1 of
limb and square of jaw, tanned and
brown, he looks the typical American,
and while at first sight he would be
sized up as a rancher, he is one of the
best educated young men of the State
and is at the head of the San Juan
school system. His personality adds
great strength to the ticket In San Be
nito County and his campaign will give
the Republicans an additional member
in the lower house of the State Legis
lature.
The outlook in the , eastern .counties
of the Sixth District admits of but one
presumption â that . Roosevelt and
Needhara will receive unprecedented
majoritiesâ and if the other counties of
the State do as well the majority for
Roosevelt will 'run '.close to, If 'It does
not exceed, 60,000." "
During the last week Congressman J.
C. Xeedham has been through Mon
terey, Santa Clara, San Benito and San
joaquin counties, making speeches
every night and talking once or twice
to afternoon assemblages. During the
week be has addressed audiences at
Pacific Grove, Monterey, Salinas, Wat
sonville, Santa Cruz, â¢ Hollister and
Tracy. Everywhere he has been greet T
ed with enthusiasm and everywhere he
has spoken to crowds that filled the
halls to overflowing. Prior to his com
ing leaders pf both parties had been
complaining of the general apathy of
the voters, but wherever he has been
the Republican apathy,, has been, re*
markable solely for its absence.
In Monterey County the Republicans
will make a better showing than in any
previous campaign, in point of major
ity. In the entire county the registra
tion has slightly decreased, but as a
matter of fact the registration in the
Republican strongholds is almost 50 per
cent greater than it was two years ago,
and there has been a falling off of reg
istration in Democratic districts that
has alarmed the leaders of the latter
party. J. B. R. Cooper, the Republican
candidate for the Assembly, will Â«arry
the county by a large majority and Sen
atorial Candidate Henry W. Lynch will
receive far more than enough votes in
Monterey County to offset any defec
tion in San Benito County, which he is
also to represent.
In Santa Clara County the Democrats
are not making a strong fight and the
election of George C. Cleveland to the
Assembly and a good majority for
Senator Rambo are conceded. Roose
velt and Needham will have even
larger majorities than were given Pres
ident McKinley and Needham four
years ago.

NEEDHAM'S TOUR
OF THE SIXTH
, Opposite the home of mourning a
company of police officers in full uni
form was drawn up, who, at the, ap
proach of the' flower-laden casket,
stood at attention. Among those who
paid . their last tribute to the dead
were many stalwarts who made his
tory In the turbulent days of the '60s,
when partisan spirit ran rife on the
frontier. "
The interment took place at Holy
Cross Cemetery, whence the j friends
journeyed' by car. At the grave-side
a: beautiful' service was held and the
fresh e,arth .that took to. its bosom
the 'good friend, the loving father,
the upright citizen, was piled high
with lovelv flowers â the last tribute
to the honored dead.
The church was crowded, with
friends and their sympathy went out
to the bereaved relatives, whose res
ignation to the divine law' was prayed
for by the Rev. Father Lynch.

An interlocutory decree of divorce
was granted by Judge Sloss yesterday
to Louisa K. Hislop, who charged her
husband, Georgre W. Hislop, a traveling
man, with infidelity. The custody of
the tiree children, a boy of 14 years
and two girls of 8 and 6 years, respec
tively, was given to the mother. The
question of alimony will be fixed on
the settlement of the findings.
The suit was begun in December last.
The trial was sensational, the husband
contesting the case bitterly, and even
producing the deposition of Violette
Griswold, the co-respondent, in which
she denied the misconduct alleged to
have taken place between herself and
Hislop at the Hotel Raleigh. During
the trial Henry A. Brown was present
in court. He was the friend of the
Hislops and has been sued by the hus
band for $50,000 damages for the aliena
tion of his wife's affections.
Cruelty to the family cow is one of
the allegations in a complaint for di
vorce filed yesterday by Annie M. Law
son against Marshal Lawson. She also
charges him with cruelty to herself and
desertion, and neglect besides. - She
says that his brutal disposition led him
often to go out and beat their cow until
it was nearly dead. The wife also de
clares that Lawson would "Eneak away
from home and go to visit a neighbor
ing girl named Eva Clark," and' that
he would buy shoes and clothing for
the girl when his children were in need.
He would make his wife work in the
orchard and compel her to live. In tents
and shacks.
,A suit. for divorce on the ground of
neglect was filed by Mrs. K.' E. Law
ton against F. .H.' Lawton. They were
married at Sari Rafael on October 26,
1903, and she says he has failed to pro
vide for her, though amply able to
do so.

The two-women had been busily en
gaged on Friday night packing up their
few household' effects,' as they intended
to move yesterday. Worn. out by the
work, they retired arid slept only too
soundly. Whether one of them turned
out the gas and. accidentally turned it
on again or whether they, left .the Jet
burning and it ,wais .blown out. by. a
gust of wind will not be known.
One theory is that Alma, who was in
the habit of studying late at night,
turned out the gas and that the sleeve
of her night dress caught in the stop
cock as she sank wearily to her pillow.
Mrs. Tillie Dieffenbacher , and her
pretty seventeen-year-old daughter,
Alma, were found dead from gas as
phyxiation , yesterday in their bedroom
at '2614% Larkin street. The fact that
two windows were open and that : the
gas Jet was only half -turned on would
indicate that death was the result of an
accident. . . -. . - ' \. .

of the pleas for the defense at the
trial,"; but it was ignored by the jury.
Benes came from Los Angeles and be

him he;; shot and ' killed her at the

"The Board of Supervisors is the
source of authority, so far as your
board is concerned, in all matters per
taining to public improvements, as the
provisions of the charter indicate;' ;
"The_ charter contemplatTeV'that- the
Board of Supervisors shall exercise su
pervisory 'control over all: expenditures
when they are not specifically .deprived
of such control, and the mere approval
of a budget which makes; available a
sum for a particular purpose.; does not
deprive the board of the right to 'decide
when such shall be used. Conditions
may change or " cost ' of proposed Â¦. im
provement be Increased to such an ex
tent that it would be unwise to . pro
ceed, so that the discretion given the
board as to the* advisability of \ the ex
penditure . may prompt the abandon
ment of a proposed improvement."
The effept-of the opinion will- be to
render, nugatory the contract to F. ,M.
Yorke & Co. to repaveH; street, as the
Board of Supervisors decreed,. that it
would Â» riot ' pay \ any demands ; oh ! the i
contract - because the " Board -of ;â¢ Public
Works ; had never - asked for! authority
to do the work. The contract to pave
Fourth street has not yet been award;
ed, although bids have been: invited for
th e same. . " ' : \ ' ;
City Attorney Long yesterday advised
the Board' of Public Works that special
authority for each improvement ; must
be secured from the Board, of Super
visors, irrespective of budget provisions.
The opinion was asked in connection
with questions by the board:
1 â As to the sufficiency of; your au
thority in proceeding with the repaving
and widening of Fourth street, the
funds for the cost of which were appro
priated in the last budget : ]y Â¦/;Â£
2â As to the - sufficiency of . your au
thority in advertising for and letting
contracts for the repaving of H street,
specifically mentioned and for which
funds, were .appropriated in the. last
budget.
The opinion says:
"The mere fact that the Board of Su
pervisors itemized each improvement
and segregated the various amounts,
instead - of allowing a lump sum, does
not alter the fact that the ordinance
was one appropriating moneys for the
expenses of government, and "nothing
more. â¢ ?.s.;~\?i
When Mrs. Miller arrived a key was
found that fitted the door. Frantically
the sister rushed into the bedroom,
where Mrs. Dieffenbacher and her
daughter lay side by side in the sleep
of death. The room was so full of gas
that Mrs. Miller was almost overcome
before she -.could fling open the doors
and windows.
Mrs. Tillie Dieffenbacher has been a
widow for two years. She and *Alma
have had a hard ~ time making both
ends meet. The girl's salary as a type
writer for the Nathan-Dohrmann Com
pany was almost their only source of
income.
Among their few belongings scat
tered about in the confusion of packing
up were evidences of better days. In
their poverty the mother and daughter
still clung to a few little trinkets that
might have been converted into money.
Among their effects was a sketch book
belonging to Alma. The work showed
that the girl had considerable talent.
Mrs. Miller says she knows of no rea
son why her sister and niece should try
to end their lives. They were always
cheerful and hopeful.- Mrs. Miller and
her husband were always ready to help
them. Besides" Alma, there are two
other children, William, 11 years old,
and Gustave, 8 years. The boys are
now in the Protestant Orphan Asylum.
Mrs. Dieffenbacher was about 47
years of age.' She was at, one time an
inmate of a private asylum for the In
sane, but was discharged as'cured.
â¢Â¦ It is more probable that while the
weary women slept the poisonous gas
slowly suffocated them. Though the
front windows of the room were cpen
there was no draft. The doors of the
room were closed and the wind formed
a barrier of air that kept the gas In
side.
At about 11 o'clock ; yesterday morn
ing a man in search of a flat knocked
at the Dleffenbacher door. He re
ceived'no response, and as he waited
he detected the odor of gas. He noti
fied .Mrs. Eva Peach, who lives in the
flat above. Mrs. Peach telephoned to
Mrs. George Miller, a sister of Mrs.
Dieffenbacher.
The girl has been trying to prepare
herself to be a teacher."
Marks that slightly resembled burns
made by carbolic add were found on
the lips of both women at the Morgue.
This fact and whispers that Mrs. Dlef
fenbacher was mentally unbalanced
led Dr. Bacigalupi to perform an autop
sy. He found no traces of poisoning,
but sent the stomachs of both women
to the City Chemist as a precautionary
measure. The composed positions in
which the bodies were found in the bed
make all theories of suicide seem Im
probable.

It was the fourth annual ball and en
tertainment of the club, which Is now
in a flourishing condition and has done
much to revive interest here in Erin's
national dances. ,- 9S3
The most striking feature of the en
tertainment was the grand march of
200 children in costume and an exhibi
tion of jig dancing' as they stood in a
line that stretched from one end of the
great hall to the other. Little tots ac
quitted themselves creditably In the
lively step and won thunderous ap
plause.
Then there was a four-hand reel by
members of the club in costume, which
was followed by an eight-hand reel.
The dash of the Irish dancing stirred
the audience and the graceful perform
ers were liberally applauded.
' The grand march of the ball was led
by Mayor Eugene KSchmltz and wife.
There were twelve numbers on the pro
gramme and three extras. Joseph P.
Kelleher was floor manager and* his
assistants were P. J. Crowe and B. J.

The success of the entertainment was
greatly enhanced by a stereoptlcon dis

were highly appreciated and the mani

The Santa Rosa' Press-Democrat con
tributes this - paragraph to the litera
ture of the campaign:
"The Call appears to have given up
Its attempt to back up Mr. McKinlay's
absurd claim that 'Bell had nothing
to do with securing the naval collier
appropriation,' but it has not yet apol
ogized either to Mr.' Be!l for misrepre
senting him before the people nor to
Senator Perkins for garbling his, in
terview on; the subject."
The accuracy of The * Call's version
of the collier legislation is* vouched for
by Senator, Perkins. Moreover," Victor
H. Metcalf. 'of President Roosevelt's
Cabinet wires to the : Republican State
Central Committee' that' the collier
was obtained by - Perkins* Sen
ate amendment. The Call's orig
inal assertion . that the only
achievement of o Bell in Congress
was the abolition of the canteen at the
Soldiers' Home is amply verified. The
prohibition : press * is . giving the Con'-'
gressman all the credit he deserves for
this, legislation.
It is common talk in political camps
that Bell's declaration. in favor of giv
ing lip the Philippine Islands will cost
him many votes on November 8. Bell's
utterances at Colusa on the topic will
be discussed this coming week by all
the Republican campaign speakers .Â» of

CHAIRMAN OF'' THE â¢ GERMAN
AMERICAN REPUBLICAN RALLY
AT THE ALHAMBRA. THEATER.
The German-American citizens of
San Francisco solid for the Repub
lican ticket from top to bottom. This
fact was demonstrated last evening at
the Alhambra Theater, which was
crowded with the members and friends
cf the German-American Republican
Club, which called the meeting to in
dorse the candidacy of Roosevelt and
Fairbanks and the Congressional, leg
islative and judicial nominees of the
party.
In the absence of President Weinecke
of the club C. B. Rode, vice president,
presided. His enthusiasm for the party
ticket inspired the audience, and he led
it in the frequent bursts of applause
that greeted the speakers. Mr. Rode
spoke briefly when he took the chair
and assailed the Democrats for their
eiforts to mike "Imperialism" the is
sue of the present campaign.
"The cry of â¢imperialism" that has
been raised by the Democrats should
tie us more closely to the Republican
party, because the Republican party's
demonstration of ; courage has caused
the cry of the Democrats. The Demo
crats say that only hoodlums went to
the Philippines to fight for the flag.
Though this is false, we will say to
them that it matters not, for our sol
diers came back victorious and honor
rested on the flag and on the people.
Their victory vas well won, and now
it is incumbent upon us to retain the
fruits of their victory, and we will not
prove false to our bounden duty."
The remarks of Mr. Rode were en
thusiastically applauded. General
Salomon, a distinguished veteran of
the Civil War and official, was first in
troduced by Che chairman. General
Salomon addressed the audience in
German, and that his remarks won
the approval of the audience was at
tested by frequent cheers and applause.
Following General Salomon's speech
the Stanford Republican Quartet sang
"America" In German to the great de
light of the audience. The German-
American Club Sextet also sang songs
that won approval and applause.
SHASTA ORATOR SPEAKS.
Thomas B. Dozier of Shasta was the
next speaker and his remarks proved
the most interesting of the meeting.
In the years gone by Mr. Dozier was
a Democrat and, knowing how it feels
to emerge from the darkness of false
doctrine into the light of demonstrated
truth, he had an unusual story to tell
to the audience and it listened to him
with treat interest from first to last.
In part Mr. Dozier said:
"I have not always been a Repub
lican. As. a Democrat I w'as a dele
gate to the first convention that nom
inated William Jennings Bryan for
President of the United States. How
ever, if the Creator will forgive me for
this, I will endeavor never to commit
euch an error again. The cause that
prompted me to become a Republican
is easily explained. Finding that the
Democratic policies were not making
for the progress and upbuilding of the
nation and after mature study estab
lishing to my own satisfaction that
they were drifting farther from their
avowed purpose I came to the part
ing of the ways. Then I took up the
other side of the question and found
that the Republican party was stand
ing for all things that promised prog
ress and prosperity. Then I did the
sane and natural thing and became
a Republican. And I am "glad that
I did. for now I feel that I can add
my measure to the influences that
have made this nation the greatest
the world has ever seen or ever will
se*.
"At a recent date I was going over
the mountains of my district and there
I met with evidence of the soundness
of the change of party I had made.
Coming -down the grades of these
mountains I saw heavy wagons mov
ing slowly along with their great bur
dens of wool and hops. On every hand
there were herders keeping the flocks
from mingling; farmers were busily
engaged and, where a few years before
there had been a wilderness, school
houees dotted the forests to give edu
cation ' to the children of the husband
men. How different It was from ' the
day I first traveled through that coun
try espousing the cause of Democracy!
And what has brought about this great
change In conditions? The Republican
policy of protection has done It and so
Icng as this policy remains in force
will the , posperity of this great region
continue and grow.
The last trip I 'made through this
EULOGIZES McKIXLAY.
now flourishing country I made to
further the interests of that peerless
young Republican, Duncan E. McKin
lay, who is go-ing to reclaim from the
Democrats the Second Congressional
District at" the next election.' The poli
cies Mr. McKinlay advocates - are the
policies of the Republican party and on
Mr. McKinlay the party may rely for
his fullest support when he reaches
the halls of Congress.
"And regarding the conditions in the
Second Congressional j District I want
to say something more. A few days
ago I was astonished to read that in
his speech at Colusa, Theodore A. Bell,
the Democratic nominee for Congress
in the Second District, said, that he in
dorsed the words of Senator Newlands
of Nevada when he said that we didn't
want the Philippine Islands; that we
should turn them loose, save for a
coaling station or two that might be
retained for the purposes of the Gov
ernment. I was astonished that at this
Colusa meeting, when he uttered these
words, Mr. Bell should have asked
that* the voters send him back to Con
gress to lend his aid in an effort to turn
loose the Philippines; to do an act that
would not only, be disastrous to the na
tion, but dishonorable as well.
"I am equally surprised at the stand
Newlands took that enabled him to be
thus quoted. The Congressional Record
shows that he was the author of a
resolution inviting Cuba to annex to
the United States, and the . Record
shows that he drafted the resolution
under which the Hawaiian Islands be
came an American -.territory. He was
not an anti-imperialist then, but he as-,
serts he Is now. Doubtless the Demo
cratic bankruptcy of issues . is responsi
ble for his change of opinion. 4
LET THE FLAG REMAIN.
"Bell is now saying that he believes
the Philippine Islands should be turned
loose. You , remember when the call
came to the young men of the. nation
to uphold the. dignity. of- the flag.; Many!
of the young men of this city. went to
the islands in. answer to. this : call and
they're there to-night sleeping: where
the waves beat in ceaseless requiem.
On the altar * of their * country ; they
gave up their lives; they died fighting
while the flag was nailed high to the
mast. So long as the memory of their

let the flag, remain; never . haul : it
down." .
Prolonged cheering marked the con
clusion of Mr. ' Dozier'a speech, which
was delivered with , great . dramatic
force . and in a manner that * compelled
conviction. . Judge George ,-- H. Bahrs
followed Mr. Dozier, briefly ' summing
up the* issues , of .the campaign, 'and
gave way to Julius ; Kahn, Republican
candidate* for Congress in the Fourth
District, whd.sald' in-part:
"The first thing / that . comes to j my.
mind to-night is the "quotation from
the campaign , slogan of the Democrats,
'Economy <fof : administration.' I want
to : tell you, . ; my! friends, that the Go v
ernment has never before in all its his
tory been run so economically, as at the'
present time. If 'you are . told , that ; the
expenses of : the, Government have In-^
creased; you may reply 1 that the 'popu-
lation of the country and the exports
have also increased.
"One of the first things suggested by
'the statement of the' Democrats' that*
the Government- is -supplying expensive
luxuries is the system of rural mail de
livery. It is estimated ! that there are*
23,000 free rural delivery routes', at Â¦ the
present time in the United States! Over
the routes the farmers are being sup
plied with millions of . letters and are
sending away other millions to their
friends and kin. The Democrats' do not
talk -of doing, away, with .that luxury.
They, do not dare. They know well that
if such a movement was planned they
would lose the very small percentage of
the great rural vote that may possibly
be theirs.
RECORD OF THE PARTY.
"I further suppose that the " Demo
crats consider the building and-com
pletion of the Panama canal a luxury
and a waste of money,, Let me tell
you, fellow Republicans, that the Pan
ama canal will be one of the . great
monuments to Republican administra
tion in the ages to come. They talk
about the- feeling and 'temper, of â¢ the
people toward the project and toward
the work of the Republicans while they
have been in power, but I am willing
to leave our record to the people, and
the Democrats will learn the temper
of American citizens at the polls on
November S.
"The campaign so far has been on
one side a campaign of principles
against one. of personality. I have
nothing whatever to say against the
personality of candidate Parker, . who
is a fine representative American. But,
thank God, they can say nothing,
truthfully, against our own leader.
No, my friends;.' personalities are =Â¦ not
the issue. Principles are the import
ant considerations of the day, and to
those principles j the . Republicans will
adhere and accept the ruling of the
majority."
At the conclusion cf Kahn's speech
the candidate, was heartily cheered.
The band struck up "Columbia" and,
following the music, Oscar Tolle read
a message from Robert Wlenecke, for
mer president of the German American
Republican '; Club, wishing success to
the nominees, Roosevelt, Fairbanks,
Kahn and Hayes. : l Â¦" .

SAN FRANCISCO, SUNDAY, OCTOBER 30, 1904.â¢ Owing to the disquieting rumors
about Gans' weight Willie Brltt and
AI Herford held a conference last
r.isht. The outcome was that each
posted an additional S2500 with Harry
Corbett, guaranteeing that Britt and
Gans would weigh in to-morrow night
at 1CS pounds ringside. This makes
So 000 in all which each man has
posted.
It is expected Britt will be well
within the weight, eo the additional
forfeit v.-as exacted to make sure of
Gans. The quickness with which
Herford agreed to the proposition is
taken as a farther Indication that he
anticipates no difficulty in landing

CAMBRIDGE. Mass.. Oct. 29.â The
Harvard foofball eleven was not only
defeated and prevented from scoring on
iioldiers' Field, to-day, b<rO was com
pletd? outplayed in every .department
of the game by the University of Penn
eylvaata by a score of 11 to 0. Only
Lfcrfce times throughout the game was
the Harvard eleven within striking dis
tance of Pennsylvania's goal. On two
cf these occasions ehe fumbled the ball.
On the third she was held for downs
when only twelve yards away from the
Pennsylvania goal. The game was a
spectacular one throughout. The Penn
sylvania play was extremely versatile â
punting, delayed passes, quarterback
run?, fake kicks and plunges through
the line rapidly following each other.
Twenty-live hundred followers of
Pennsylvania occupied the east side of
the stadium, and the scene in that sec
tion when Pennsylvania scored was
spectacular. â¢
The game, was unusually rough, slug
ging being frequent on both tides, and
for this offense two Pennsylvania play
ers were ruled off the field Jy Referee
Kd wards.
From \ the appearance of' Joe Gans
yesterday; and ' accepting 6s accurate
the statements of Manager Herford as
to his weight, â¢ the * lightweight .cham
pion will present himself at Mechanics'
Pavilion on "Monday night at '.weight.
To do so will require that he deny him
self in the matter. or liquids, and also
that he. must continue his work on the
road until -Monday' noon.
After being, on the .road, yesterday
morning; and working In the gymna
sium-in the afternoon his weight was
annqunoed^as being" 134^ pounds.. He
will work on the , road both morning
and afternoon : to*day, and Trainer
Frank 'McDonald expects him to go to
bed 'to-night 132 pounds. He
loseB- one -pound each night/ so he
should Â¦ awaken to-morrow morning
weighing 131 pounds.
He will, be kept : up lateto-nlght and
will sleep to-morrow until 10 o'clock.
This is intended' to make the waking
hours of Gans as short aa possible on
the day the fight. After breakfast,
which will consist of quail and other
delicacies, he will go on the road and
will bring himself back to the 131
pound notch, if the calculations of his
trainer work out in a satisfactory man
ner. He has touched 133 pounds during
his present training. He will come to
the city at 3:30 and will eat a substan
tial dinner. about 5 o'clock. This is ex
pected to land him In the ring at 9:30
just under the weight.
GANS' BODY SEEMS RUGGED.
If these natural methods do not bring
about the desired results the Champion
must have recourse to baths and rub
bing, something neither he nor his ad
visers are counting. on at present.
While Gans' face, is drawn, , the re
mainder of his body, seems normal. His
legs,, arms and shoulders, as seen
through â¢ his training clothes, are not
below their usual size. In his gymna
sium work yesterday Gans wore a suit
of light underwear and a sweater. He
had been at work roughing it with
"Kid" Sullivan in a cold room but a
few minutes when the perspiration
commenced to gather on his face,
showing he is not dried out to the limit
of his endurance.
The days when big Overall held the
Indian sign high over the heads of the
Commuters are no more. They can j
go in and get. the big fellow now, and i
when he has not a bunch of control at j
his com.nand it i3 even more easy for j
Uncle Peter's warriors. They were |
never in danger yesterday, for Doc I
Moskiman was making the Tigers look
like ordinary monkeys in every Inning.
Score â Oakland. 3; Tacoma, 1.
' The Tigers took several trips high
into the heavens when the Commuters
managed to get men on the paths.
These periods, as a general rule, were
full of disaster, for the Oaklanders
were light of foot and ready to skim
around the green on the slightest
provocation. Only two hits figured in
the run getting, though others should
have produced results.
Moskiman's grand work in the Oak
land box was the most remarkable
feature of the game. Barring an error
by Devereaux in the first round, the
Tigers would not have approached any
place near the plate. Devereaux erred
on the first ball hit by Doyle and Shee
han sacrificed. Nordyke produced the
necessary hit and Doyle saved his
mates from the humiliation of a shut
out. .* ;
With one to the bad in round three
Moskiman drew a pass. Ganley
dropped one at the plate and Graham
threw it away at first, putting Ganley
on and sending Moskiman to second.
Francka forced Bobby, but Dunleavy
laced a fast one to right, bringing the
Doc in. Doyle heaved to Sheehan and
the latter booted the ball. Francks
was frisky and kept on. running till he
landed in safety.
There was a lull till the fifth, when
the Commuters eased another man
over the jumps. This time .Ganley led
oft with a hit and stole. Graham
again tossed badly, the ball going out
to center and letting Ganley anchor
at third. The hit and run signal was
given and went wrong the first time, for
Dunleavy fouled. He had two strikes
when it was tried again. He missed,
but the ball got away from Graham
and Ganley slid in without interrup
tion. The score:

In his work with Sullivan he showed

had enough. This was after twenty
minutes" work."
Gans then took on Rudolph Gross
man and went through the same tac
tics with him.
According to Manager Herford, Gans
weighed 132V& pounds when he fought
Erne In 1902. He signed for Rufe Tur
ner some months later at 135, and
weighed in at 134 pounds easily. For
three years he has been fighting at
catchweights, as there has been no
legitimate lightweight In sight until
Britt appeared.
BRITT IS NOT CONSISTENT.
Gans scoffs at Brltt being able to
hold both the feather-weight and the
lightweight titles should he win the
latter to-morrow. He thinks Britt is
not consistent in making him scrape
down to the lowest point to defend
his title when, he claims, Britt has
said he will defend the feather-weight
title at 132 pounds.
Gans smiles broadly when his friends
ask him if he will make the weight.
His invariable answer is: "I'll be
there all right and be able to take care
of myself."
Gans 1 seconds on Monday night will
be Al Herford, Sol English, Frank Mc-
Donald and Kid Sullivan. ZlcK Abrama

MANY BBILLIANT FEATS
Disastrous Accident Occurs
While the First Section of
Train Is Taking on Wood
Men who are In the habit of risking
money on the outcome of prizefights
seem scarce at the present time. At
least their money is not making its
presence felt. All day and night yes
terday the. odds of 10 to 8, with Gans
the public choice, prevailed and there
were only a few takers at this tempt
ing price. 0'.M
No large wager* were recorded.
Somehow or other the betting men are
shy on coming forward with their
coin. There seems plenty of them
who will talk about the price and
v/hat man they like, yet when it cornea
to digging into their jeans and pro
ducing the hard metal they are" not
there this time. It looks as though
the sports are holding back for some
thing to spring in a day or so.
Brisk betting is predicted for Mon
day. It would appear at the present
time that Gans will enter the ring a
7 to 10 favorite or perhaps a trine
longer. If the odds happen to drop a
point the Brltt bettors will unquestion
ably make a jump, for it is believed
many of them are holding out for a
more reasonable opening.

Britt's work yesterday consisted of
a four-mile tramp in the morning and
the usual stunts in the gymnasium in
the afternoon. He tossed the medicine
ball, punched the bag, pulled and
shoved about the wrestling mat with
"Tiv" Kreling, wound the wrist ma
chine and swung the dumbbells.
Spider Kelly called upon Britt yes
terday and after a conference a deal
was made whereby tha astute second
is to go behind Jimmy to-morrow
night and will be his chief adviser. It
seemed for a time Kelly would not be
the director in chief of Britt's coach

was reached and Kelly will be there
with the quick eye and quicker wit.
ALBANY, Oregon, Oct. 29.â Six men

ST. LOUIS, Oct. 29. â McLaughlin.
who rode four winners yesterday, won
the first four races on to-day's card.
Pretension won the feature with big
weight up. Amberlta, winner of the
last race, was heavily played at long
odds and the books were badly hit.
In addition to taking fully $50,000 out
of the ring, large commissions were
sent to various outside poolrooms.
Amberita, at 50 to 1, ran second on
Wednesday after being knocked to
her knees at the first turn. The book
makers offered 20 to 1 against her in
the first betting to-day and at post
time the Schreiber cast-off had been
backed to 10 to 1. She won easily
by five lengths from Frank Rice,
while the favorite, Bengal, was third.

JAMAICA. N. Y., Oct. 29. â The
Sathch'bgue handicap was the feature
with James R. Keene's Augur a favor
ite, notwithstanding his bad physical
condition. With Dandelion, Glenecho,
Gamara and others more or less freely
supported a good contest followed.
The start was a good one, the entire
field hanging well together for about
a furlong. Be*!!
Soon after that the horses on the
inside began to suffer from interfer
ence. The principal one to show this
was Glorifier, which dropped back
next to last half way down the back
stretch. Meantime the pace was be
ing set by Dandelion, with Glenecho
a close second and Gamara an equally
good third. In the stretch Gamara,
next to . the rail, came on under a
drive and disposed of Dandelion. He
was then called upon to withstand the
resolute challenge, from the unlucky
Glorifler, which had been crowded
back next to last in the first quarter.
He made up all this lost ground and
was gaining so fast on. Gamara that
until the numbers were exhibited by
the Judges the verdict was in doubt.
Dandelion was a good third .and Pas
adena, which was forced to â¢come
around four other horses, was a close
fourth. Augur was. last. Summary:

RHEUMATISM comes from poor digestion, stomacii troubles, torpid liver, weak kidneys and a general
sluggish condition of thesystem. Food souring in the stomach poisons the blood-^it becomes too acid. The
liver and kidneys fail to act properly, and the circulation is clogged .with impure matter and burning acrid .fluids
which penetrate and saturate the bones and muscles, joints and nerves, producing the terrible pains and aches and
other disagreeable symptoms of Rheumatism. As it originates in the blood and affects the whole system, it will riot

These three sets of coupons were
from two townships in Pratt County
and the city of Wichita. Shortages are
shown in these the same as in the Gar
den City case; but the money has not
been returned to the treasury.
The largest shortages are in Cowley
County, which has paid nearly $5000
into the State treas"ury which is not
accounted for. Reno County is ; short
nearly $4000, Allen County has paid
over $2500 and McPherson County over
$2100 which is not accounted for.
The dates given show that many of
these" shortages occurred during the
last administration, but the present
State Treasurer is looked upon as re
sponsible because he was; Assistant
Treasurer during that time, in fact T.
T. Kelly has handled the funds during
the entire time covered by the investi
gation.
Three sets of coupons were sent to
the State fiscal agency by Kelly, at the
same. time he sent In the Garden City
coupons, the money for which was
mysteriously returned by "A. R.

TOPEKA, Kans., Oct. 29.â At jioon

report from State Accountant Rowett,
showing additional startling shortages
In the State treasury aggregating in
all about $31,000 and covering school
fund transactions concerning Pratt,
Cowley, Nemaha and other, counties.
Accountant Rowett draws no conclu
sions from his findings. He simply re-
COTda the. fact that certain blocks of
bonds were purchased on certain dates
by the school fund commissioners and
that certain interest, payments were
-made on these bonds which are not ac
counted on the books of the State
Treasurer. 1 The largest shortages are
In Cowley County. .
Recently Accountant Rowett submit
ted a preliminary report in which he
disclosed an alleged shortage of $1400.
Following this State Treasurer Kelly
filed his resignation in escrow Â»to take
effect in case the charges against his
office were proved.

The weather was almost cool enough
for football and the ground was in ex
cellent shape. The visitors had an ex
cellent represeritatioji on the bleachers
and ' the blue and gold looters were
numerous and noisy.
The liira-up follows: *
The officials handled the game well,
and there was consequently little op
portunity for those who wished to kick
to do so. Both teams punted liberal
ly. California was surer on line plays.
Pomona showed excellent team work
at times, but was weaker than the op
posing boys on tackling.
FIELD IN GOOD SHAPE.
Hopper put a combination freshman
and secoxid team on the field for the
last half. Neither goal was in much
danger during the rest of the game,
although it seemed at one time the
home eleven might be penalized enough
to give a score to the visitors.

on it Then the home team went down
the cridiron for the touchdown. Dur
ing the remainder of the haif the pig
skin pet-sawed about the middle streak
of whitewash. When the referee 8ig
iialed for the intermission the bail was
in Pomona's hands on California's
forty-yard line.

Pomona got the ball to the blue and"

minutes of play. California braced,
and the visitors tried for a field goai
The ball fell inside and Heltmuller

The one touchdown of the day was
made near the close of the first half.
Pomona fumbled on an attempt at a
field goal from the thirty-five yard line
and California â¢ got the ball. Mead
made thirty yards aronnd his team's
left end. After that Boynton. Mead
and Siiedigar plunged through for
steady gains until the first named went
over the line for the score. Force

Pomona is faster, with the exception
of Carliiie, than any other outfit that
has been seen cn a Western gridiron
for mauy years. The eleven had its
signals and was lined up for play be
fore its opponents were aware they
vere not to get their accustomed
period of rest after every scrimmage
If the visitors had not fumbled fre
quently and had their interference not
strayed from home they should have
won. * .-" .'- : ;
California had the advantage in
weight and her men bad more class.
When it looked like a touchdown for
Pomona the blue and gold huskies re
membered where they were and got
into the came. California's ! tackling
has improved immeasurably within the
last two weeks, and it would take a
crackajack to make consistent gains
through the line. The principal fault
with the blue and gold is that the men
seem rather spiritless, indicating that
they may be going stale. Coach Hop
per played two full teams yesterday,
and if he works carefully along such
lines in practice until the big game
his students should be in trim.
* The ends are inferior to Stanford's.
Belknap or squeaky little Whitman
may yet solve the quarterback prob
lem. Kitrelle went to end yesterday,
w here he should be more useful.
TOUCHDOWN IN FIRST IIALF.
California defeated Pomona by the
Email markin of five points in the
football g;:me yesterday at Berkeley.
The visitors played the blue and gold
eleven off its feet for a few minutes in
each half, and were good for substan-
Ual guins at almost any stage of the
i-ontest. The niult of the game was a
decided disappointment to the home
team and its supporters.
Special IMsp&tcb to The Call.
Treasurer's Resignation Is
in Escrow to Take Effect
if Charges Are Proved
Coach Smith of the Oregon team
thinks not. In an interview . this aft
ernoon he said:' "In comparing Cali
fornia and Stanford, I would say they
are- evenly matched. The two lines are
almost exactly equal in my opinion.
Both are heavy and strong, but I should
call California's line the superior in
aggressiveness and speed. Stanford
holds, and holds hard, but her*forwards
are slow, while the Berkeley men
play snappy ball. I believe, too, that
Berkeley is stronger behind the linÂ«
than Stanford. There are fast, heavy
backs on both teams, but the Berkeley
men are almost twice as fast in get
ting started. I should say that it is
almost an even break between the two
teams. We were whipped to-day by
Stanford by a much larger score than
in the Berkeley game, but that can
easily be explained by the fact that to
day we put a crippled team into the
field. You can't run a light team
against a heavy one without smash
ing it up, and we have not yet recov
ered from last Saturday's game."
CARDINAL SCORES EASILY.
Sprott started the game by .kicking
off forty yards to Gray, who gained
only a few yards. The men from Ore
gon then tried Stanford's right and left
end. and as > they failed they punted to
Bansbach, who advanced ten yards.
Sprott, WelIer, % DoIe and Chalmers, run
ning in tandem formation, ; carried the
ball down the field, making from two to
eight yards at each down. Dole gained
seven yardB carrying the ball to thfi
three-yard line. Weller carried the ball
through right tackle, making the first
touchdown. Sprott kicked the goal.
Next Ttmpleton kicked off to Bans
bach, who advanced ten yards. Then
by a series of line bucks by the cardinal
backs the ball was taken past the goal
in a few minutes. Sprott again kicked
the goal.'
Oregon then kicked off to Clark, who
carried the ball fifteen yards. Stanford
once more began her line plunges, and
her effort was soon rewarded by an
other touchdown. Sprott kicked the
goal, making . the score 18 to 0. There
was no more scoring in the first half.
During the second Half Stanford with
her line buck gained from five to twen
ty-seven yards at every down. Oregon
only had possession of the ball, twice
during the second half, getting it both
times on a fumble. The cardinal eleven
made three touchdowns this half. As
Tomasini failed to kick one of the, goals
the final score was 35 to 0. The teams

ford goal in danger, and the only mild
in.terÂ«ist aroused was in seeing how
large a tally the heavy Stanfordites
would be able to run up.
The visiting team was light and fast,
but it crumpled up like pasteboard
when it was thrust jigainst the mas
sive rush line of the Stanford men's
defense. When the heavy cardinal back
field surged into the Oregon forwards
it almost invariably swept them, down
the field. A touchdown every.flve min
utes was made straight through the
game. It was a bucking game from
the first. . Lunagan's pupils tried but
few end runs, and these were almost
without exception singularly abortive.
Moreover, the spectacular quarterback
run, hitherto so effective, netted no
gains for plucky Bansbachand his sub
stitute, Stott. Whether or not the
Stanford team will ever be able" to
run up a score by smashing at Califor
nia's stone-wall line is a matter of the
most serious question.

A COMFORTABLE FUTURE.
WHY NOT?
Did you ever stop to think when paying;
your landlord 12 to 10 per cent on his invest-
ment for rent, that for absolutely no more and
probably a much smaller monthly payment you
could own your own home? In a , few short
years it would be completely paid for.
A HOME IN BERKELEY,
There you can have grass and flowers and
trees and breathing spots and. best of all the
purest of air and the best of schools for your
little ones. We offer you all these. - togetht r
with the best all-the-year-round climate in the
world. '

Our list of bargains is so complete that lack

He is no Imitator." HU.work Is upon original
lines: jmre thought, clear vision. He tells
you what you' desire to know, and works In
the open light.
He is as conspicuous for his wond erf ul occult
analysis as he is for his original expression
and vivid truthfulness. ' ,
A test reading is not a life reading. When you
; call on Professor Livingstone he will give
you 1 a full Ufe reading for $1. A test Is of
little value. When the mind is troubled you
need more substantial aid and advice; this
Is Just what Prof. Livingstone - gives you
when you call on him for a flrst-class clair-
voyant reading. â¢ â¢
He asks you no questions, but tells you what
you wish to know.
Would it not be a relief to know bow you wfll
succeed, to be relieved of the matters that
are troubling you, and of the schemes of
your enemies that you may meet with better
success?
He dots not mention all \ the Ills arid mosf or-
tunes you are heir to; you are acquainted
with the facts in your case. Let Professor
Livingstone analyze the matters that are
troubllnr you, find the cause of the trouble
and surgeet the remedy.
Does this appeal to you? He does not locate
hidden treasure or read by mall. Without j
asking a single question tells you what you
wish to know.

Movements of Steamers.
TO ARRIVE.
WEATHER ; REPORT.
: There were no . loud, cheery, "Oh,
heave oh's" as they ; rolled the vanvas
into a close furl, for on that yard death
was lending* a hand, and though death
sails with Jack and is always ready to
lend a hand, the monarch of terrors is
an unwelcome shipmate. Bean died on
the yard and his body was lowered to
the deck, to be buried next day in the
blue -Pacific.
As the California was ' nearing the
Golden Gate Friday evening the man
up in the "crow's nest" raised a big
right whale close to the vessel. Here
were. 140 barrels of oil skylarking right
outside the Icrew's home port, and they
had cruised a whole season and not a
single right -whale had come to their
harpoons. Captain \ Joseph . backed his
main topsail and prepared to lower the
boats, . when the whale sounded. It was
traveling rapidly to the south and
darkness was on the sea before it again
arose for breath.
. - . The whaling bark California, Captain
Joseph, arrived; yesterday, ; thirty-eight
days from the Kurile Islands, north 'of
Japan. Her season's catch is a; light
one," consistingr of twenty sperm whales,"
yielding 820 barrels of oil. She left this
port December- 2, 1903, going to ..the
Hawaiian Islands, Guam and west to
the coast of Japan. The whaler: Wil
liam Barks was seen at Hakodate July,
23 with 1000 barrels of oil, .and ; the ; An-,
drew Hicks at the same port with 600
barrels. .; - :
A death occurred on the California
while ; the vessel : was cruising off .the
Hawaiian Islands. "-'Jesse' Bean, one ; of
the crew, ; a;" native of .Denver, \Colo.,
was afflicted with heart failure and had
shipped -on the whaleri thinking that
possibly , a few months at sea .would-be
beneficial. Bean told his shipmates -of
the possibility of : hig death and .asked
them to look Â¦ out for him should Â¦ he J be
struck down suddenly. He was on the
main yard with a number of other sail
ors furling the j mainsail when the ex
pected end â¢ came. The stricken man
was seen to drop the fold of canvas he
was grasping and : lean- limply over the!
yard. He would have slipped from his
insecure perch and. fallen into the. sea,
but the man next to -him held Bean
across the yard while the sail was being
stowed. , . .Â» j .'.--.' ; ' ,

EASTERN MARKETS.
CHICAGO, Oct. 29.â In the wheat pit the
*lÂ«ech of the British Premier regarding Anglo-
Rucrlan affairs seemed to effectually dispel all
apprehension of hostilities between Great
Britain and Russia. The market was further
influenced by the bearish action of foreign
markets. As a result lower prices prevailed
here throughout the ' entire session. At the
opening December was down %c to at
?1 13 U to $1 13%. while May waa off Vfcc to
f-.c at $1 XlÂ»* to $1 11%. From the start
there was heavy liquidation. With an absence
of any substantial support the market became
weaker as the session advanced. In addition
to the bearish advices from abroad, the do
mestic news favored the bears. A report from
Minneapolis stated that there was little de
mand for either cash wheat or flour. The
movement of wheat from the farms continued
heavy to-day. Selling became increasingly'ac
tive late In the day on a statement of. the
English visible supply, showing an Increaso
of over 3,000,000 bushels during last week.
There were also large evening up sale* over
Sunday. The low point on December for the
day waa reached at $1 12 and on May at
(1 11. The markets closed practically at thÂ»
bottom, final quotations on December being
l%c lower at si 12 and on May V4@%c lower
at 51 1101 HHc
In corn the opening was %^%c lower and
It ruled weak in sympathy with wheat. May
closed ii'6%0 lower at 48He*8&4c.
Oats were weak and dull. December closed
%o lower at 2SÂ»ic.'
Notwithstanding the weakness of grains,
the provision market held steady on a fair
demand for lard. At the close January pork
and ribs were unchanged, and lard was 2}&c
higher.

LOCAL MAUKETS.
Trade In fresh fruits was moderately actlv*
on local account, but the market for deciduous
fruits w'as generally weak, as supplies . of
most kinds were more than sufficient. Figs and
good eating Pears were rather scarce and firm,
while Persimmons. Pomegranates and Quinces
dragged at unsteady prices. Conditions apd
prices in tho Apple market were unchanged
and ordinary offerings were piled high in the
stores. Two cars of Oregon Apples were mar.
ketrd and four carloads were reported due from
Colorado on Monday. Table Grapes were In
freo supply and weaker, as the 'cool.' cloudy
weather checked the local demand. ' and there
was nothing doing in the shipping line. A few
lots of Wine Grapes were received and were
offering at $23 per ton, but no sales were re
ported. Berries were in good request at steady
prices. Melons are dropped from tho Hat, a*
there are very few offering and there' is no
more demand for them.
Citrus fruits were reported steady, par
ticularly for fancy Lemons, which were scarce.
Some new crop' geedllng Oranges arrived from
Oroville and were offered at 52 00 per box. but
found no buyers. Ten boxen-. of new Tan

mand Is good, though en the hand-to-mouth

Dried Fruit In Xcw York.
Mail advicea from New York say:
"The week ended with a much better tone In
the Prune maiket than has been displayed
for a long time past. The Improvement in 'J^e
Â«; -l market is b&?cd mainly upon a dema.sd
created ty the slow delivery of goods bought
for shipment from the ccan Jobbers, who are
not getting guprliet from this source as fast
as they need them, being obliged to come Into
the spot market to idece out their stocks.
While this demand 19 not -large it iÂ« made
ai>j*rent by the ecarcity of available epot
rtock, more especially of the sizes to which
the bulk of consumption ]Â« running at pres
ent. Thr&e are 4C6-5&?, Sfts-eue and 9Ce-100s.
Whllo the fpet market in firm, buyers are not
paying a rremium for these scarce alzes. The
tame jIzps are in limited supply on the coast,
t:..J for prempt shipment are commanding a
premium on the price of Intermediate sizes,

ETOCKSâ Continued heavy buying to-day cf
high-grade investment Flocks carried the whole
market before It. Settlement of complication
between Russia and England practically left
the atmofr-hfre clear for inside Interests to
Co ahead and purchase certain stocks which
will eventually be taktn Into the larger cor
porations. This feeling is the irreatest stimu
lant the market had to-day. The expectations
of extra <!ividenJa in the future from a number
of our preat railway systems ia causing pur
chases l>y investment lnstitutlona of large
blocks of best railroad stocks, which is leav
ing the market quite bare of many Uiues.
The industrial outlook could not be better with
the polltlcstl situation settled and the continu
ance cf the present administration assure! for

Prices for everything remained unchanged
yesterday, though one butter house sent out
cards oflerlns its best creameries at 23c. The
week closed with an excessive surplus to be
carried over. There is a feeling among the
trade that ' there is no use in offering tho
goods any lower, on the ground that it would
not rtsult in any . more Butter being' sold.
Still, a warm rain might cause an abandon
ment of this argument. At' any rate, the
market Is choked with ' fresh Butter, for
which there Is at present a very limited outlet
and a poor demand.
Butter and ChecHe remain ns before quoted,
both being quiet. Stocks of fine ranch Eggs
continue cleaned up, and receipts yesterday
were unusually light.
Receipts were 35,700 lbs Butter. 479 cases

THE ETC ELK GOLD MINES COl.
716 Italian- American Bank Bids..
i San' Francisco. Cal. .- JThe presence at the St. Francis Ho
tel of E. A. Wiltsee, formerly of this
city and now stationed in New York
as the American representative of the
lxÂ»ndon Venture Corporation, has
brought to light the fact that he is
here in connection with a big mining
deal involving more than $2,000,000. It
concerns the flotation of the Lluvia de
Oro mine in Chihuahua, Mexico, which
has suddenly come into prominence as
one of the richest and most promising
gold producers of the southern repub
lic While the negotiations for the
purchase of the mine are actually pro
ceeding in the East. Wiltsee found it
necessary to come West to straighten
out certain details and to await here
the arrival of experts who have been
sent to Mexico to examine the prop
erty. : Â¦â¢'â¢â¢â¢
The Lluvia de Oro mine is owned by
a syndicate, in which Is prominent B.
F. Yoakum of the St. Louis and San
Francisco Railroad, F. D. Heed, H. E.
Carry. Frederick Edey and James
Campbell of New York. It has been
bonded to the London Venture Corpor
ation. According to reports from New
York the option price on the property
has within six months advanced from
$600,000 to $2,000,000. The mine was
originally owned by Bernardo Garcia
cf Chihuahua, who sunk a hole in the
ground about thirty feet deep and
struck ore running as high as $1000 a
ton. When it was purchased by the
Ycakum syndicate many of the best
miners of Chihuahua and that vicinity
expressed grave doubts as to itÂ« value,
their opinion being that the mine was
simply a pocket, but since then it has
been producing richly.
Several years ago Harry S. McKay,
a well-known mining engineer of Los
.Ajjgeles, was employed in the Lluvia
d-> Oro mine, and with a two-stamp
null he cleaned up $51,000 in four
months. As a result of last year's
work about $4,000,000 worth of ore has
been opened up and blocking out has
been going on at the rate of $500,000
a month. When the London Venture
Corporation, through E. A. Wiltsee and
it? managing director, Frederick
Baker, began negotiating for the prop
erty, a corps of engineers was sent to
Mexicqo thoroughly to inspect the
mine. Their reports so far have con
lirmed the stories that have drifted
north concerning its riches. One of the
engineers is expected soon to arrive
here for the purpose of reporting to
Wiltsee. When seen yesterday, how
ever. Wiltsee declined to be interview
ed regarding the deal.

When rummaging through the vault
this morning officials found the en
velope and money,' but there are many
who doubt if it has been there all this
time. County Clerk Miles immediately
dismissed Clerk Williams.
The matter was probed by J. Wilbur â¢
Cate, a real estate man, who heard that
$500 had been paid by the owners of the
Poppy colony to the county to defray:
the expense of opening a road to the/
colony. He went to the records, but i
failed to find any entry of the payment I
of. the money in to the Treasurer's of-'
fice. Supervisor Bullard, to whom the i
money was paid sixteen months ago, !
vhen asked about the matter said he \
had handed the money to the clerk, i
When Williams was " interrogated he ]
said the money had been paid. He said
he had been paid with a check, which,
instead cf taking to the Treasurer's of
fice, he cashed and placed the money
in an envelope. i
FRESN'O, Oct. 29.â What appears to
be a case of carelessness, or worse, in
the County Courthouse came to Ufrht
this morning in the office of the Board
of Supervisors. As the result a new
clerk is now in charge and Supervisor
Bullard rests under a cloud. The dis
missed clerk of the board is L. R. "Wil
liams. The dismissal of Williams
due to the discovery that $500 had been
lost. The money, however, was found
this morning, but under such circum
stances that it was determined to dis
pense with the clerk's services. -!
