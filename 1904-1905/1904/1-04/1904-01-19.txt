not say whether we will instruct or
not. If there Is anv necessity for in

pect that story" is circulated by Demo
"Is it not generally understood that
a large number of Republicans in New
York desire the nomination of Senator
Hanna. and is it not a fact that there
Is pressure to prevent instructions for
the President?" ;.: '
"I will answer that by saying that
Hanna Is not a candidate for the Presi
dency. I have just had a long talk
with him. He will net allow the use
of his name. In addition to that he is
for the nomination of Mr. Roosevelt.
Tliere need be no doubt on that score."
"Is it the intenticr -' New York Re
publicans, now that the call for the
National Convention has been Issued,
to call an early State convention In or
der to forestall any attempt to organize
the State for Hanrta?"
"I the State convention will

Legislature."
"But will not that make a very late
convention in .view of what the Gover
nor has said, that .there is need of
much legislation and that he is in favor
of a long r session?"
"I don't think there will be a long
session of the Legislature, nor do I
think there is much need of legislation,
and I do not think the Governor was
quoted accurately when he was made
to say that he wanted a long session."
"Have you seen or communicated
with CWvernor Odell lately?"
"No, I have not When I went South
I cut off my mail and know nothing of

"No, but I presume Knox has as good

A statement of grievances on the part

Secretary Hay answered this note
under' date of January 5. He says the
Government has carefully considered
the grave complaints made, and assures
General Reyes of our most .;, friendly
sentiments for ' the Government and
people of Colombia. The, question sub
mitted, he says, can be considered only
in the light .; of accomplished facts, of
which one Is that j the republic of . Pan
ama has become a member of the fam
ily of nations. . â¢'
, "The department has. read with sur
prise," Hay : comments, j â¢'your repeti
tion of gross imputations upon the con
duct and. mrftives of- this Government,
whlclr are said â¢; to , have appeared In
reputable American newspapers."
Hay reviews in detail, first* the neces
sity of a waterway connecting the two
oceans, and, secondly, all the legislative
and' diplomatic * .procedure which has
taken | olace; to secure-that end. -
* Secretary Hay says the. United States
had faithfully ; borne, during the lofig
period since the treaty of 1545 was com
pleted.! the . full burden of its responsi
bilities. ,.Â¦> -^
~ 'rMeanwhile,**. he continues, "the great
design of the -treaty of - 1S46 Â¦ remained
unfulfilled. 1 and in -- the end it ' became
apparent, as has heretofore' been shown,
that Â»it could; be only by the
.construction! of a; canal by â¢ the Gov

- - "By ; the ' declaration . of Independence

General Reyes says â¢ that Panama
has become independent because the
Government of thei United States de
sired it; because with its incomparably
superior force, the United States pre
vented the landing of Colombian
troops; because even before the sepa
ratist movement was known- in Bogota
the United States had its war vessels
at -the entrance' to Colombian ports,
preventing-' the departure of Colom
bian battalions; "because, without re
gard to the. precedent established by
statesmen who have dealt with the
matter, the United States has not re
spected our ; rights in- that strip of
land which Colombia - considers 'as a
divine 'bequest- for the Innocent., use
of the American family of states, and.
finally, -because the Government of the
United 'States,' invoking - and â¢ putting
into practice the right of might, has
taken from us by bloodless conquest,

important part of the national terri
tory." ..i ... - iV-Iil-. 7 ':'Â«â¢' .'' ' Â¦

SANTA BARBARA, Jan. IS.â After
having lingered between life and death
for almost two months from a bullet
wound, which it is charged was in
flicted by Mrs. Jennie Downey, Charles
Wilson, a pioneer business man of this
city, died to-day.
Wilson's death had been expected for
seme time. Mrs. Downey has been con
f.red in the County Jail since the shoot
ir.g av.aiting trial on a charge of as
sault with a deadly weapon with Intent
to commit murder. The District Attor
ney will to-morrow formally charge
Mrs. Downey with murder.
The differences between Wilson and
Mrs. Downey arose over a suit brought
by Wilson to recover possession of se
curities amounting to several thousand
dollar?, which, he alleged. Mrs. Dow
ney had stolen from his safe. Mrs.
Downey in turn brought suit for the
recovery of a large sum of money
â¢w hieh she claimed to ha%-e placed in
Wilson's keeping. While the litigation
was pending Wilson was shot when at
his place of business. There were no
witnesses, but Wilson charged Mrs.
Pown^)' with the deed, which charge
ene'has neither admitted nr>r denied.
When the train reached Ogden at 2:30
o'clock this afternoon the license was
ready and Municipal Judge Howell traa
on hand. The final words of the mar
riage ceremony were spoken as the
train was moving out of the station.
The two women had with them only
the clothing- they wore, so it was ar
ranged that the sister should get oft
at Reno, pack the bride's trousseau:
and forward it by express. This shÂ«
did. A message was sent on to Daniel
Hamer in Ogden to have the County
Clerk issue a. license as directed and to
have somebody at the railroad station
to perform the ceremony.
While on the way to Reno the con
versation turned to the large number
of Californlans who cross the State Una
to that city and get married. After
joking about being fashionable and do
in? likewise the lovers discussed U
seriously. Finally they agreed to get
married in Reno.
Then they recalled the fact that it
was Sunday and they could get no
license there. A Utah man with whom
they had become acquainted suggested
that If they would come on to Ogden
he would arrange in advance, through
friends, to have the license ready and
some person on hand qualified to marry
them. They decided to avail themselves
of his services. v-
OGpfcN. Utah, Jan. IS.â Weddlnj?

boarded the overland limited train at
San Francisco little expecting they
would be married before the journey's

Miss Reynolds in San Francisco. He
lost his heart to the American girl and
ere he *left on a trip to his old homo
to look after some affairs In connection
with his estate he obtained her con
sent to become his bride. The wedding
was to have taken place on his return
in about six months.
Miss Reynolds and her sister went to
the train to bid Westrope "Cood-by"
at Oakland. Westrope and a friend, a.
Butte man, persuaded the two to boanl

Speda! Dispatch to ThÂ« Call
SALT LAKE; Utah, JairL 18.â Friends
and former cronies of John .Oldham,
the Utah mining -millionaire, received
another shock to-day "when it became
known that he had turned E over his'en
tlre bank account to his bride. Last
week Oldham, who is 72 years old/ cre
ated a sensation by marrying Miss Jean
O'Neill, aged 20, a. chambermaid of a
local hotel, whom he had , known ' only
ten days. The couple are now supposed
to be somewhere in California on their
honeymoon tour, which is later to in
clude Scotland, .where the parents; of
the bride reside.
It was known that John Oldham had
presented Miss O'Neill with $5000 on
the day she promised to become his
bride: that h& had given Her an addi
tional $10,000 on, the wedding'day; but
his friends were scarcely prepared to
learn that he had turned over to the
Scotch-Irish lassie all the available
cash which he had in bank. Yet this is
exactly -what he did. â 'â-- â r
The day before he left here with Miss
O'Neill to be married,' a. journey, that
is tol be prolonged into a. year's wedding
tour, John Oldhaijn sipned checks which
made JUs <wif eittieÂ»DÂ«BS**ssoE-*i -hia* eni
tire' bank' account.'-yTWs"tact,-lws-l>een
confirmed, although -the- exact â¢ amount
of the transfer is not known. It is said
to be in the neighborhood of $300,000. Â¦
Oldham by no means beggared him
self by this act of generosity, however.
He is possessed of mines and stocks in
other enterprises which bring him a
magnificent income and which are esti
mated in value at several millions. . ,
Old chums of the man, who was a
poor prospector ten years ago, \ decline
to believe that Oldham is sane. They
declare that he has always manifested
an aversion of the fair sex and fre
quently declared that he "would not
marry the best woman on earth." That
he should suddenly wed a girl of 20
whom he had known but ten days and
then turn over his money to her, is to
his friends of ihe.Comstoek and. Park
City almost beyond belief. An old
prospecting friend of Oldham voiced
the general opinion of the miners by
remarking:
"The next thing we will hear is that
Oldham has throwed his old pipe away
and is smoking, cigarets."

John F. Clark, a letter carrier, de
scribed the failure of the fastener to
work at a test made in 1894, at which
Machen and Samuel A. Groff were
present, which, he said, caused Machen
tn remark to Groff at that time that
unless the fastener would work without
sticking he would not recommend its !
adoption.
WASHINGTON, Jan. IS.â In the trial
of August W. Machen, the Groff broth
ers and Dr. and Mrs. George E. Lorenz,
charged with conspiracy to defraud the
Government, the prosecution introduced
a number of witnesses to-day to prove
the relations of Machen with the' Lor
erszes and the Groff brothers. One of
these. Ina Liebhardt, Machen's former
stenographer and chief c:erk, testified
concerning visits of Dr. and Mrs. Lor
enz to Machen at his office, but declared
on cross-examination that during the
several conversations she heard noth
ing was said about letter box fastener*.
James E. Bell, superintendent of de
livery of the Washington City post
office, testified that the Groff fastener
had been adopted without any report
on it having been submitted to him,

Thp Governor also honored a requisi
tion from the Governor .of Idaho for
the return of W. L. Simpson, now un
der arrest at Petaluma. Simpson is
charged with grand larceny in having
absconded with the sum realized from
the sale of a cror> in which another
man had a partnership interest and
upon which there was a chattel mort
gage.
The Governor had some doubt as to
whether this act could be defined as
grand larceny, but it was found that
the alleged offense constituted that
crime under the Idaho law and the
warrant was Issued.
BAKERSFIELD, Jan. 18.â J. Mi Hud
dleston, Deputy City Marshal of Tex
arkana, Ark., has arrived here to take
charge of H. R. Fletcher, alias J. R.
The case is one of the most remarka
ble ever brought to the notice of the
Governor's office. Coffee is alleged to
have committed a murder at Texar
kana. Ark., in 18S9. He was arrested,
tried and sentenced to be hanged.
"While he was awaiting execution he
contrived to escape from prison and,
eluding his pursuers, made his way to
California and took refuge^ in Kern
County.
As the years wore on he felt secure
from detection and established a home
for himself,' soon earning the reputa
tion of a peaceable and industrious cit
izen. So prosperous did he becorse that
he sent East for a brother-in-law.
That was an unlucky . move, for the
relative had been in Kern County but
a short 'time when he quarreled' with
Coffee and. took revenge by notifying
the. Arkansas officers of his where
abouts. This action led to the Arkan
sas officers applying to Governor Par
dee for the necessary authority to
bring Coff.ee back to the scene of his
alleged crime. It is said the conviction
of fifteen years ago will stand against
Coffee, although the death sentence
will have to be passed on him anew.
SACRAMENTO. Jan. 18.â Upon a
requisition from the Governor of Ar
kansas, Governor Pardee to-day issued
a warrant for the arrest of John R.
Coffee of Bakersfleld. The warrant will
be served to-morrow.
Coffee, who is charged with murder in
Hempstead County, Arkansas, and
whose case was acted upon by Governor
Pardee to-day.
Huddleston was ' accompanied by G.
T. Conway, who is acting as a special
agent for the Governor of Arkansas
and who went through to Sacramento
with the papers for Governor Pardee
to arrange for the man-'s extradition.
Huddleston said to-day that It is a
.fact that Fletcher or Coffee broke Jail
after his conviction, of the murder of
his cousin, but before he was sentenced.
The reported conviction carried with it
the death penalty.
The killing is said to have occurred
when Fletcher was about twenty-one
years old and when the victim was
about nineteen. This woaid make the
prisoner about thirty-five years old
now, the age which "his brother-in-law
Bell has claimed. There are many
persons In the county now living who,
the officer says, should, be able to rec
ognize Coffee or Fletcher.
To-night Huddleston received a tele
gram from Conway saying that he will
be here with the necessary papers late
to-night and .as soon as they, are prop
erly, certified to the officers will leave
for Arkansas with the prisoner. It Is
believed there will be no objection to
extradition. : - ' Â¦ Â¦ * ' Â¦' > ; .â¢ â¢
ST. LOUIS, Jan. 18. â Judge Wood
in the Circuit Court to-day held that
a medical college had no jurisdiction
over the heart affairs of its students
and vcould not legally withhold a di
ploma from one of them who had
fallen in love before the time set for
his graduation.
The decision was on the application
for a writ of mandamus to compel the
Barnes Medical College to issue a
diploma to Onus' York of Muskogee, I.
T., class of. '03, who entered the col
lege in October, 1900. It was alleged
as a reason for withholding the
diploma that York fell in love with a
young woman with whom he after
ward quarreled, .and that she, through
revenge, told of their love affairs to
the college faculty. This was before
York's class was to graduate and he
was expelled and a diploma refused.
The writ. of mandamus was granted.
by St. Louis Court.

KANSAS CITY, Mo., Jan. IS.â Judge
John F. Phillips of this city, sitting in
the Federal court in Kansas City,
Karis., gave a decision ' to-day which
frees William Martindale, former vice
president of the First National Bank
of Emporia, Kans. Martindale was
indicted for misapplication of the
bank's funds. The failure of this bank
in November, 1901, was followed by
the suicide of its president, Charles F.
Cross, within an hour after the bank
was closed. The indictment against
Martindale consisted of eighteen
counts, charging the defendants with
misapplication in some instances, or
abstraction of others, in issuing checks
on his account in this' bank, in which
he had no funds. The amount on
which indictments were based is less
than $5000.
President Cross, in a letter found
in his desk after death, had taken all
the blame of the failure upon himself
and fully exonerated Martindale and
Davis, the cashier, of any connection
with the failure. 'Â»-'i?.'Vui

LONDON. Jan. 18.â Justice Jeune in
the divorce division of the High Court
of Justice to-day granted Major Wal
ter de Sumarez Maud a divorce on the
ground that "Mrs. Maud's marriage to
Daniel R. Hanna of Cleveland, Ohio,
was bigamous. The Mauds were mar
ried at New York April 19. 1897. While
Maud was fighting in South Africa his
wife obtained a divorce from him in
America and on February 18, 1900, mar
ried Mr. Hanna.
CLEVELAND. Ohio. Jan. 18. â
When shown the telegram announc
ing the decision of the London- court
to-day. Dan R. Hanna declared it was
a mere thechnicality. S. H. Holding,
Hanr.a's attorney, said:
"Under English law the divorce
granted in Ohio did not annul the
dower rights of 'Mrs. Maud and hence
Major Maud was compelled to resort
to English tribunals to secure abso
lute freedom to deal with his property.
The necessary showing to be made un
der English law was to set up the
divorce granted in this country and
the remarriage to Mr. Hanna as a
jrround of divorce, as English courts
do not recognize American divorces.
I took proof of the divorce in this
country and sent it to Major Maud, as
I was his attorney in the case and
represented him at Akron. He was in
this country at that time."

The arbitrary 100 per cent advance
in price of one of the essentials of the
modern treatment of diphtheria is held
by the physicians to show that pro
vision for the constant supply of the
article devolved upon the municipality
as a measure for the preservation of
the public health. The high price now
placed on the serum by the "death
trust," it is declared, means that
thousands of children may perish in
the first diptheria epidemic which ap
pears in the city.
SPRIXGFLELD, III., Jan. 18.â The In
ternational Serum Toxine Company of
Phoenix, Ariz., was to-day licensed by
the Secretary of State to incorporate
in Illinois. The company stock is
$1,000,000, of which $10,000 is in Illinois.
CHICAGO. Jan. 18.â A municipal
laboratory for the manufacture of anti
toxin under the supervision of public
chemists may be the outcome of the
campaign instituted by the Chicago
Medical Society against the high prices
exacted by the manufacturers* com
bine, or so-called "death trust."
At a conference of the officers of the
organization the feasibility of the
ycheme was discussed in detail. The
result is a decision to refer the matter
for final action to a meeting on Wed
nesday, with the recommendation that
the plan be adopted as the permanent
solution of the problem. If the ap
proval of the society be obtained some
Aldermen will be asked to introduce an
ordinance creating the laboratory and
ruaking the necessary appropriation
for its foundation and maintenance.
The inspectors are making an effort
to show that in some way the pumps
were reversed and instead of pumping
out the water from the engine room
more was being taken in through the
seacocks. The belief now seems to be
that the Clallam did not spring a leak.
VICTORIA, B. C, Jan. 18.â M. Jen
sen, a seaman of the Clallam, gave evi
dence at the Coroner's incuest this
morning that he had cl.arge of the
flags on the Clallam, but knew of no
signal flags on board. He told of the
chief engineer having come on deck an
hour and a half from Port Townsend
and said: "I wish the captain would
turn around and go back." He told of
several visits of the chief engineer to
the main deck and how he had tried to
get into the pilot-house. Failing, he
had asked the witness to tell Captain
Roberts to keep the steamer's head to
the wind if he could. The witness said
he believed the boats would have a
better chance if they should be made
ready before leaving the steamer.
SEATTLE, Wash., Jan. 18.âTesti
mony was given at. to-day's session of
the Board of Inspectors . investigating
the wreck of the steamer Clallam tend
ing to show that the steamer began to
leak about an hour after leaving Port
Townsend. Whether this was â¢ due to
an actual leak or to a reversal of the
ship's pumps, which filled the vessel
with water, instead of pumping it out,
Is a question the inspectors are trying
to solve. . . â¢
Chief Engineer de Launay told of the
leak. He was unable to give the capac
ity of the pumps in the Clallam. It
was figured out .that the vessel's
pumps had a capacity of about 460 tons
per hour. It was shown by ; the chief
engineer that the vessel took more
water before Captain Roberts was no
tified than she did ten hours after
ward.
Public Administrator Kell and "Wal
ter A. Joy have since applied for let
ters of administration on. the estate.
The value was Kiven as probably ex
ceeding $10,000. Besides Mrs. Wilson.
James Joy. a brother, and a number
of nieces and nephews were named as
heirs.
On December 15, the day before Mrs.
Wilson was to start East with her
brother's remains, Walter A. Joy, a
nephew, secured an order in court com
pelling Mrs. Wilson to appear and ex
plain what she had done with her
brother's estate. She declared there
was no other heir but herself, but re
fused to give any Information about
her brother's affairs.
Mrs. Wilson was declared guilty of
contempt of court and remanded to the
custody of the Sheriff, with the warn
ing if she did not explain the follow
ing day she must go to jail.
She repented during the night, and
the next morning Judge Tuttle vouched
for her return from the East with the
coin and books, and she was allowed
to go. Later in the day a petition was
filed by Attorney R. R. Syer, in which
Mrs. Wilson asked that Judge. Tuttle
be appointed administrator of Joy's es
tate.
James Joy claims that a sister, Mrs.
Mary "Wilson, took charge of the body
and estate, removing gold, bankbooks
and securities from a San Jose safe
deposit vault and bringing them East
with her, and now refuses to tell where
the property is located. She is under
parole of the San Jose surrogate and
is ordered to produce the property -in
court. Her brother charges that she
has given away $2500 in gold to a neph
ew without any legal right. She an
swers that the property was in her
name also and she has a right to it.
SAN JOSE, Jan. 18.â John C. Joy died
in this city on December 10 last while
on a visit here with his sister, Mrs.
Mary Wilson. After his death and
while his body was being prepared for
shipment Mrs. Wilson withdrew a num
ber of bankbooks and $5000 in gold be

offered his remarks in the nature of a

WASHINGTON. Jan. IS.â The United
States Supreme Court again to-day re
affirmed the ruling made in the case of
Carter V3. the State- of Texas, to the
effect that the exclusion of negroes
from Grand Juries in cases involving
criminal charges against members oZ
their race, is Li violation of the con
stitution and therefore not permissible.
The decision was delivered by Justice
Holmes in tha case of a resident of
Alabama narced Rogers, who was in
dicted for murder by a Grand Jury
composed entirely of white men and
from which it is chargsd that ai!
negroes were excluded because of their
color. Ths Supreme Court of the State
upheld the regularity of the proceed
iigs. but Rogers brought it to the Fed
eral court on a writ of error, with the
result that the decision or the State
court was re**erssd and the case re
manded to the State courts for further
proceedings, not inconsistent with to
day's opinion.
The opinion was based on the Carter
case. In which it was held that "the
exclusion of all persons of the African
race from a Grand Jury which finds an
indictment against a negro in a State
court, when they are excluded solely
because cf race or color, denies him
The inauguration of the new rates
is expected to be followed shortly by
the adoption of an Increased tariff on
eastboand fref^ht. although no def
inite date has ye: been set for a con
sideration of the advances.
Several of the new ratss that wens
originally Included in the tariff sched
ule that went into eiTect yesterday
have already been changed as a result
of protests from shippers who werÂ»
able to satisfy the railroad companies
that the industries to which they ap
plied would be seriously aSTected.
It Is expected that* further changes
will be made, but to what extent ia
only a matter for sr^cvilation.
The new Â¦westbound freight tariiT.
adopted several months ago by the
Western ra!lroad3 and which changes
the rate on about 120 different com
modities, went Into effect yesterday.

patch had been received, had ordered
oM men. with six machine guns and
.six pieces cf artillery^ to fce placed at
readiness for active service, but a start
would not be made until January 30.
The serious Intellig-ence now at hand
made it necessary to send out imme
diately a battalion of 500 marines in
addition to the other troocs, with a
complement cf guns and railroad pio
neers. These would embark on Thurs
day on a North German Lloyd l!ner
and would arrive at Swakorapund. Ger

to Kurino. the Japanese Minister, but
: to the other diplomats assembled at th?

I "Such a message could be published
In Russia only with the special per
mission of the Government and it In

AFTER BITTER CONTEST.
Russia recognizes Japan's predomi
nance ia Korea and Japan recognizes
i Russia's special position in Manchuria.
j There are two main Questions still at
1 issue â the Russian demand for a neu
tral zone upon the Korean side of the
Talu River, which Japan met with a
proposal for a similar strip on the Man
; churian side. Japan also asks for cer
i tain guarantees covering Manchuria,
i which Russia thus far has declined to
; grant. It is pointed out. however, that
I the assurances given a few days ago by
Russia regarding open ports in Man
churia and respect for treaty rights 13
a concession on this point.
That the two countries are not so far
apart may be fairly inferred from the
following statement made by Kurino,
the Japanese Minister:
"War would now only be disastrous
\ to both countries. Owing to the gao
< graphical situation armed conflict
[would result in a great drain on the
I men and treasure of both, Japan and
I Russia without being decisive. Besides
i I believe it would not be worth whilÂ»
j to* go to war on the questions still in
j dispute.**
There is a strong Indication that.
! through the Czar's personal acts, the
â¢ peace party is completely in the as
,' cendant. Bezobrazoff. the head of the
i war party, has grone abroad: Foreign
'. Minister Lamsdorff, who from the-be
| ginning has favored peace, 13 now com
pletely rehabilitated, and Viceroy Alex
} if- ff ha3 been made subservient to the
j Foreign Office In the Russo-Japanese
| negotiations. His extensive powers are
j curtailed and he can make no move
I without the Czar's personal approval.
i In fact the fresh assurance conveyed
j through Embassador Cassini to the
j authorities in Washington of the recog
| nltion of the tights acquired by the
I Chinese treaty is largely attributed Â«to
' Count Lamsdorff's Influence. Diplo
matic circles regard Count Lamsdorffa
conduct of the negotiations under the
Czar's direction as a very hopeful sign.
Another strong influence on the side
of peace has been the attitude of
Witte, president of the Council of
State, who has been bending his ener
gies toward avoiding a conflict.
ST. PETERSBURG, Jan. IS.â The

Under all the circumstances, cays the
Secretary, the department is unable to

Morgan supported his written state
ment with a brief speech and was im
mediately followed by Daniel with a
resolution declaring against the policy
of reporting any treaty or bill until
each member shall have offered any
amendments he may desire to present.
Senator Daniel declared that the
course of the committee had been both
precipitate and unfair and urged, that
th*> treaty should be recommitted for
further consideration.
Replies were made by Senators Cul
lom. Spooner and Allison. Speaking
as chairman of the Committee on For
eign Relations. Cullom said that the
treaty had been in committee for al
most a month before it was taken up.
He conceded that during the greater
portion of this time Congress was not
In session, but said he had called the
committee to meet on the first regular
meeting: 'lay after the Senate convened
and that at his instance it had been
holding daily sessions most of the time
Â¦ince. He declared that very careful
cor.siiiera.tlon had been given to all the
details connected with the treaty, and
said that instead of precipitancy being
manifested the committee had given
the utmost consideration to all sug
gestions for amendments and had
adopted some of them.
Ko action was taken on Daniel*3
resolution or Morgan's protest, but be
fore the Senate adjourned Cullctn- gave
notice that he would ask the Senate
to take up the treaty tOi-morrow or
"Wednesday, and. until disposed of, to
consider it from day to day to the ex
clusion of other business.
during the greater part of the present
session, the Panama canal treaty was
not reported until to-day. It had no
sooner been reported favorably to the
Senate in executive session than it be
came the subject of heated contro
versy. Senator Cullom made the re
port in favor of the treaty, whereupon
Senator Morgan, as a member of the
committee, at once entered a formal
protest against the acceptance of the
report, oa the ground that when the
committee decided to report the treaty
an amendment was still under con
sideration, and that he had not had
time to present an amendment looking
to the striking out of article 22 of the
treaty, in which Panama renounces
her right to participation in the earn
ings of the canal wherv built.
Majority members of the committee
say that .for two weeks the treaty has
been under discussion and they felt
that amp!* time had been given to it3
consideration.
ent. The former voted agaisst the
treaty and Money said that he had not
yet had time to consider it, as it was
the first meeting of the committee he
had been able to attend.
The three amendments relate to san
itation, limitation of cities and control
of harbors. The United States, by the
amendment relating: to sanitation, is
granted more direct power in all sani
tary regulations. The amendment con
cerning the limitation cf cities more
specifically defines the limits of Pan
ama, and Colon in relation to the canal
zone. The harbor amendment gives
the United States control of the har
bors for the purposes of improvement.
On Saturday at the meeting of the
Foreign Relations Committee Senator
Lodge offered a motion, which was
agreed to, providing' that at the next
meeting of the committee the pending
amendments should be disposed cf and
the question cf reporting the treaty to
the Senate taken up. Members of the
minority say that none of their mem
bers were present when the motion o*
Senator Lodge was adopted- To-day
when the committee met the absentees
were Senators Foraker, Bacon. Clark
(Mont.). Clark (Wye), and McCreary.
All the amendments were subject to
final acticn. though one or two had
been tentatively agreed to.
After they had fceen incorporated in
the treaty to-day Morgan moved to
strike out article 12. of the treaty,
which provides for the completion of
negotiations with the new Panama
Canal Company for their rights and
concessions en the isthmus. Senator
Lodge insisted that this pas not a
rending amendment under the resolu
tion adopted on Saturday, and it was
ruled out of order. An amendment had
been prepared by Senators Bacon and
Foraker relating to appeals to United
States courts in certain cases arising in
the canal zone. This was voted down.
Senator Morgan protested against this
action, saying that the amendment
should not be acted uson in the absence
cf Senators who had offered it. Pro
test also was made by the minority
against the cutting oft cf opportunity
to vote rn the amendment striking out
article 22.

Professor Charles Mills Gayley, head
of the English department at the Uni
versity of California, wishes it under
stood that he is not covertly sinking a
dagger into the back of co-education
simply because he has barred the wo
men students out of his course on
"Great Books" this term. In an inter
view he said to-day that his sole pur
pose in shutting the door against wo
men was to make co-education more
efficient so far as his own classes are
concerned. This, he says, cannot be
done where the women crowd into the
classroom so thickly that a poor, lone
man cannot squeeze throngh the door.
That is not co-education.
Professor Gayley's idea is that as
sociation in the classroom is not the
valid and vital principle of co-educa
tion. He barred the women out of his
'"Great Books" course because there
were too many of them, but next term
he will put the same restriction on the
men. In the meantime he is evening
up matters by permitting co-eds only
to enter his class on Shakespeare, the
men being shoo'ed away as fast as they
come. â¢".:.

that brought the department apparatus..
Fire Chief Ball directed his men and
so carefullv handled the flames that
eerious damage to the rooms was avert
ed. The fire ate through the flooring
and to Bowman & Co.'s drugstore
below, causing some damage there.
In the club rooms the large wooden
hand-carved Egyptian mantel around
the fireplace was badly scorched, but
was not irreparably injured. The paint
ings, piano and elaborate furniture
were moved out of harm's way by tne
club attendants and a corps of volun
teerr, club members, attracted to the
rooms by the fire.
The losses to the club and to the
building are covered by insurance. Re
pairs w ill be made at once, that the
rooms shall be in readiness for the
club jinks on January SO. This is the
third fire from which the Nile Club
has suffered sinci* its organization.
The first ono occurred three years ago
in the Bacon block, when a defective
prat- c-aused considerable damage.
This was followed a year ago by the
destruction of thÂ«Â» Bacon block, which
Â¦'viped out the club's quarter*?. The
new home, unique and elegant, has
been completed only two months.
Fire at 10 o'clock this morning threat
ened the destruction of the Nile Clubs
beautiful home at 1107 Broadway. By
prompt and efficient work of the fire
department the richly furnished apart
ments were saved, but not until con
siderable damage had been done to the
luxurious hangings, frescoing and other
interior furnishings.

A fharp contest over a $5000 damage
suit brought by James McKeon, a crip
ple, against Millionaire Joseph LÂ».
Boardman, was begun this morning
with the trial of the suit before Judge
Ogden. Both sides have strengthened
their array of attorneys since the filing
of the suit and this morning . M. C.
Chapman appeared to aid Attorney H.
Berg-en in the prosecution of the case,
while D. M. Deimas of San Francisco
appeared to assist H. C. McPike in the
defense of Boardman. Â¦..,-,"â¢
McKeon. crippled with rheumatism,
was wheeled to the Courthouse and was
the first witness called. He stated that
he had been renting a house of Board
man at 727 Eighth street and that with
out warning or preparation for such
an emergency Boardman sent work
men, who raised the house, disconnect
ed the gas, water and sewer pipes and
hooked to the building and moved
it around to Brush street. He claims
that the house, after being moved, was
left propped up several feet in the air
for three weeks, during which time
he suffered great inconvenience.
Boardman was present in court and
listened apathetically to the recital of
the sorrows; of his former tenant. Both
men are over seventy years' of age.
The trial of the suit will be continued

COUNCIL COMMITTEE FILES REPORT
REGARDING WATER SUPPLY FOR CITY
P roposal of Bay Cities Company, Which Owns Properties in Mount Hamil
ton Range, Is Rejected Because of Expert's Unfavorable .OpinionâCon
tra Costa Corporation Submits Offer to Arbitrate Valuation of Plant
mend to the favorable consideration of the
Council.
Under this conviction Mr. Fitzgerald was
engaged In May to try to establish this value,
and in line with this policy your ccaimittee
!â¢"Â« persistently, and consistently worked until
now. . , , ,
Tour .committee, after a careful, survey of
the situation, concluded in the beginning of Its
inquiry that the permanent and complete solu
tion of this problem with its annually, recurring
vexation -and strife ;iay . in ;the purchase' by the
city of the" existing wateV plant, with all its
alle.gpd deficiencies, ' provided'; it could 'be^ob
tained'at a value whlch'.we;migiÂ»t safely com-
' Taking up â¢ the" Contra' - Costa> Com
pany's offer, and that, phi.se generally
of the situation) "Â¦Â¦ the s corrirhittee says : . \
"".Do the electors ' who are property-owners
desire to mortgage their, property for the sum
of .56.000,000 to embark In a struggle of in
definite length with an established concern for
a division of its- business, -that yields. in the
gross only $600,000 per annum? * .
The committee adds that it believes
the existing, difficulties will yield to
treatment that will be honorable and
fair to all i Interests concerned. It re
ports that the Bay Â¦ Cities Company is
dissatisfied with Expert Fitzgerald's
report and has withdrawn its proposi
tion recently submitted- to, the Mayor
and is preparing a' nev one. ' '
' Â¦ CONTRA COSTA' COMPANY.
Apart from \ prejudice Â¦ based on the past or
of Â«ntiment founded not upon a thorough etudy
of the matter in all its bearings, the com
mercial question as It stands at present may
be stated with exactness In the following
manner: .. - ~ â¢
With these assumptions, which- are too fa
vorable to the city, we .have a possible busi
ness of 5.000,000 gallons per day, which at
10 cento per thousand would yield, a gross in
come of $500 pes. day or $182,500 per Â¦ year,
with which to meet ' fixed charges In the ' be
ginning of ,.$390,000 per annum, plus.operat
ing expenses and .renewals.' .
Is it a sufficient answer to say that, al
though during such a struggle the loss to the
city would meet Its compensation in the re
duction of the total cost for water furnished to
the consumer? Â¦Â¦ - ' ' . Â¦ :Â¦..-.
If is safe to . eay . that under the fierceness
of such . rivalry the average â¢ rate would drop
to at least 1O cents per- 1000 gallons, for dur
ing the war between the Contra Costa and
the Oakland companies It went far below that
figure. :, â¢ - â¢*â¢::. ,
. It >flnds that .$6,000,000 would be re
quired to carry-through the Bay Cities'
project; requiring ; total annual fixed
charges of $390,000 to meet interest on
bonds and a sinking fund. * The argu
ment is made that to establish this new
plant in the. face of the. installed Contra
Costa system wOuld mean a division of
business and, a slaughtering of rates
and, says the committee:
The committee emphasizes its belief
that the city should own its water sup
ply, but -adds:
The monopolistic control of such a utility
by, a city- and, the mortgaging of its property
to wrest such ' control from another : strongly
entrenched concern are propositions j so ' dif
ferent as to demand cool reflection before de
ciding on a course that may cause future
regret. \
CITY SHOUL.D OWN SUPPLY.
Ab the report of the Â¦ expert Is unfavorable
the committee for that reason, if for no other,
cannot commend the proposition to favorable
consideration, because the interests Involved
are too vital to the city to Justify a costly
venture in a scheme which In Mr. Fitzgerald's
opinion would bÂ« at best of problematical
value. Â¦ . . : . .
â¢Doubtless this adverse report will prove a
disappointment, and itÂ»may provoke criticism
and attack, but the committee concluded that
before It could address itself to the commer
cial and financial aspects of this project those
features of jt which were, professional and
technical in their character should first be
settled. - :>Â¦-,,
he advises adherence to .some standard type
of dam construction. ' " .
5 â He condemns the use. of' wooden stave
pipes for the forcing main between the pro
posed pumping plant and the local distrib
uting reservoirs. .. Â¦' .
The bond committee's report on gen
eral municipal improvements will ba
filed next Monday night.
An ordinance, was passed to print re
imbursing . Councilman Howard for
$2500 advanced as" a fee to Expert Fitz
gerald,, who - has gone to . Manila to
handle a waterworks .project for the
United States Government.
The report is signed by the commit
tee as follows: John L. Howard (chair
man), George W.Dornin, B. C. Cuvel
lier, A. H. Elliott and B. H. Pendleton."
The Council adopted a resolution di
recting the president to appoint a spe
cial committee of three to select an ex
pert for the city on the proposed board
of arbitration.
Let them In the interest of economy and ef
ficiency . buy the services of the most compe
tent engineer attainable and give him full ad
ministration charge with the responsibility for
the outcome.
Starting- with that class of men who would
operate the plant upon strictly business prin
ciples, and free from what are known as po
litical influences, they would see to It that In
the filling of vacancies none but. men of their
own grade would be appointed and that the
strictly business policy at first engrafted upon
the system would be continued uninterrupt
edly. '
He may Â¦ be trusted to nominate flrst-class
business men of wide experience in large af
fairs, wbO' might object to standing for elect
ive office, but who would serve the city in an
office of appointment.

that .such a plant would be, subject to the
evils of political patronage and place hunters
and to abuse by unworthy men who may get
Into power.

Enact legislation giving the present Mayor the
power to create a self-perpetuating Board of.

REAL ESTATE TRANSACTIONS.
i Owing to the condition of- water In the res
ervoir, and I to the fact that the water I drawn
from the reservoir during Â«. -large part of the
year will be mixed ..with, other, waters flowing
from creeks - below the dam,* and : which has
not had the. benefit of storage, the mixed water
will- not, be of good qtlallty, â¢ and in order to
make 'It- of high standard the . cost of . a , filter
ing Â¦ plant 'and - the expense .; ofi' Us operation
', must be Incurred.. \
4 â The form^of dam which the plan proposes
while theoretically -unobjectionable, has never
been tried In. the United : States. Because "of
the liability of . selsm|c disturbances . in Cali
fornia he does riot . recommend the ; experiment
with a dam .of such height,'" and on account
of the importance of this part of. the project
The quantity of water available under the
proposed plan will not be aÂ« .'great . as 'that
stated in the company's proposition, and dur
ing long periods of drought, which "have . been
experienced and which may recur, there would
not be a proper supply for the needs-, of '.the
city In the near future considering the" rate "of
Increase In population.
. 2 â Great, confusion , exists " In the law and
decisions in this State regarding water appro
priation. The exact rights and the extents of
such rights in the region under - consideration
cannot now be determined, and they are likely
to become the subject of litigation.:
But- if jthe enforcement of., thsse rights by
riparian owners should have no greater effect
than that stated by the Bay Cities -Wafer
Company ' then the net amount available :*or
the daily uÂ«e of the" city of Oakland would
be reduced to . 11,350,000 gallons. - Â¦
Â¦ ; 3 â Unsatisfactory quality. â¢*
1 â Insufficiency of supply.
In the report, ..which was read by
John L. Howard, chairman of the spe
cial committee, the reasons for the rec
om.mendat.ioji of. the . Contra Costa
Water Company tender and the setting
aside of the Bay Cities Water Com
pany proposition are given in extended
detail.. The latter company,, in response
to* its request, was invited to 'submit
another proposition. \ . - < 5 ',
After reviewing the preliminary work
the committee's report takes the
Bay Cities' matter and summarizes the
objections made by Expert Fitzgerald.
In this connection the report reads: â¢
Cities Water Company's proposal to in
stall a supply from its properties in
the Mount Hamilton range, the com
mittee's action being based upon , Ex
pert Desmond Fitzgerald's unfavorable
report upon the project. Instead the
committee has received from the Con
tra Costa Water Company an offer to
submit to a board of arbitration the
long fought question of the value of
its plant, jthe valuation to cover a prop
osition to lease the plant to the city for
twenty years, with option of purchase,
and to .stand as a basis for rate fixing
purposes as well. â¢ Â¦ Â¦Â¦ '
This proposition is contained in the
following letter, made a part of the
report:
SAX FRANCISCO. Cal.. Jan. 14, 1904.
Mr John L. Howard, Chairman Committee
on Water Supplyâ Dear Sir; To settle, if pos
sible the vexed questions concerning the water
supply oÂ£ the city of Oakland, and being con
vinced that any fair board. of arbitration will
find the value of the Contra Costa Water Com
pany to be fully that which the. company as
serts, I make, through your committee, to the
Council and the people of the city of Oakland
the following proposition: 'Â¦ .
1. We will agree to the appointment of a
commission of three competent disinterested
experts, one to be appointed by the city, one
by this company and the two so chosen to se
lect a third, to value that portion of the sys
tem that pertains to supplying the, city of Oak
land. We agree that the value so found shall
be used as a basis for rate fixing purposes. ,
2. We agree to ! sell Eaid property to the
rlty aS. the valuation reached by the commis
sion.'
â¢:;. We agree to lease that part of our sys
tem to the city of Oakland for the period of
twenty years with an option during that time
of purchasing the property at the valuation
fixed by the commission plus the cost of better
ments and improvementp that may have been
adrird by the company between the date of val
uation and the date of purchase, the city to
pay. rental at the rate'of 5 per cent per:an
nuro. free from taxes, and in the case of non
purchase .to return the property in the condi
tion, in which it was received," maintaining
the efficiency of the plant at the present stand
ard, provlFlon to be made for the payment
by the company of any betterments or addi
tions which may be made by the city during
its lease. Yours very truly, .
WILLIAM. J. DINGEE, President.
BAY CITIES COMPANY.
8. .The city could. change the present illogi
cal system of fla"t rates by" installing meters
and selling water by measure, charging for the
amount consumed.': - ; <". : .-:-â¢, â¢ -<
-This would have the effect of stopping waste
and >_ promoting In- use. .thereby in
creasing the reserve in the storage supply'.
Â¦. By 5 making . water bills a Hen < on property
losses .will not be r Incurred, and by malting
bills payable at a central office the cost of ad.
ministration Will be kept low.--,. : - ;
0. â¢ From- : the results hitherto obtained in
this, business we are justified in the belief
that".- a competent management can produce
such* proflta which,/ If applied 'from.^year to
year to reduce the principal debt and the rental
charge, -will enable H to nearly, If not i entirely
pay the original purchase price within the Ufa
of the lease. â¢ . '
.We might, anticipate the . usual argument
METERS ARE SUGGESTED.
6. 'The water company will be ' forever re
moved from participation 'In city politics and
from past experience this is a greater evil than
alleged excessive charges for water.
7. VAtthis Juncture the. city Is practically
confronted with the choice between acquiring
a water plant, and accomplishing other needed
public improvements, because, admitting that
the electors are willing to vote an issue of
bonds Â¦ to Â¦ the Â¦ available limit, -there will not
be a sufficient fund Â¦ to acquire a water sys
tem and _ to cover the cost of all the projects
which are now pressed upon the attention of
the Council. ,
A lease with the option will admit of the
deferment of : a : water . plant purchase until a
more , opportune ; season. . . Â¦. Â¦ Â¦ _
5. If the water company can assume the
riek of a value to be placed, upon its property
by a board of carefully chosen experts It will
be equally safe for the city to assume a like
risk as to value. W&iit*S&tVV\*&U
4. That in having the value* fixed now the
city will reap the benefit of enhancement in
value due to increase - in population and in
volume "of business, whereas If the effort to
acquire It be deferred It . is certain to be more
costly and more difficult to obtain.
In detail the committee declares the
following as its reasons for recom
mending the plan: /
This we regard as, the first step in the best
and final solution of this water question. The
proposition to lease with the right to purchase
at ; a value fixed now, and this we indorse
has the following commendable features 1
1: The annual strife over valuation and
rates will be settled at once and for all time
2. The expense of the existing lawsuit may
be immediately stopped, and the uncertainty
of a decision avoided. -
3. The city may at once enter Into posses
sion of a going plant. '
Under that policy we? have evoked from
the Contra Costa Water Company the letter
which was written in good faith, and which
we commend to the careful and favorable at
tention of the Council.
' Then follows the letter from Presi
dent Dlngee to Chairman' Howard
commented upon as follows:
After receiving estimates from A. L.
Adams of the water company and from
Expert Fitzgerald on valuations, the
committee, by process of compromises,
reached a total figure, greater than
what, says the committee, is popularly
believed to be the value, but much less
than that fixed by the water company
The report continues:
But at this stage the committee became
convinced that its valuation, no matter how
reached, was unsatisfactory to the water
company, and therefore would be Inconclusive
and barren of practical results
iustarted with the fixed determination that
If any possible method existed of forever set
tling this question, it would seek it and fight
the matter to a finish, s
DINtiEE. LETTER NOTED.
To give due consideration to its earning power
and the prospect of its continuance in order
to fix, If possible, its value as a going con
cern, or what Is commercially known as the
good will of a business.
These are the points that would be taken
account of In regular mercantile practice but
to this method, of -the committee the water
company took exception. '
The committee was of the opinion that the
problem of value for purchase should be solved
In the same manner as.lt would be dealt with
If the Intending, buyer were a private indi
vidual or a private corporation. I. e. :
To ascertain the value of the useful physical
property In Its present condition, also of other
assets, if any, in the shape of rights or equl-
We are free to confess that the committee
does not possess. - nor has it expected to pos
sess; the knowledge to pass upon the. technical
questions Involved, but it has carefully scruti
nized the items of value set-up by the water
company nnd as carefully weighed thÂ» argu
ments made before It by the water company's
and the city's experts in an endeavor to reach
as nearly as possible an equitable result.
We could not approach nor treat the problem
in the manner chosen by the water company,
which viewed it as an entire system and worth
what It would' cost to Introduce an equivalent
supply, claiming by implication at least a
value for what It regarded as a monopolistic
position. .
ALAMEDA, Jan. 18.â After seven
months of agitation the City Trustees
to-night voted to give the Southern Pa
cific Company franchises lor its local
lines for the term of. years asked for
by the corporation, namely, forty-five
years for the north side line and thirty
three years for the .south side line.
President J. F. Forderer, who has
opposed the granting of the franchises,
was absent. The four City Trustees
whose votes" disposed of the franchises
were B. E. Combs, C. J. Hammond, Dr.
H. M. Pond and W. M. Botvers.
City Trustee Combs, who had all
along opposed the granting of the north
side franchise for more than twenty
five years, changed his position to
night and in explaining his action said:
"I believe that this railroad agitation
should be settled for the good of Ata
meda. I am satisfied that it cannot be
settled any other way than by the giv
ing of both franchises for the term of
years asked. ;'Â¦""
"Therefore I will vote for the award
ing of the franchises as amended."

RAILROAD WINS
ITS LONG FIGHT
Forty transfers of property for right
of way filed to-day by the Western Pa
cific Railway set at rest much of the
speculation over the intended route
through this county, of what is sup
posed to be a projection of the Gould
system. The right of way through the
city has been known through the pur
chase of property and securing of pub
lic franchises, but it has been a matter
of conjecture from which direction the
road would make its approach from the
Livermore Valley. â¢-"!â¢â¢
The deeds filed are disconnected/ but
show the general line of approach to
Oakland. From these deeds it is evi
dent that the line will not touch Hay
wards, but will run from Dublin, at the
eastern end of the Haywards pass.
From there it runs northwesterly
across Cull and Crow creeks and along
San Leandro Creek, and the Redwood
road to- the Redwood- schoolhouse.
From here it crosses the hills by means
of a tunnel 2355 feet long back of Leona
Heights. â¢;;;â¢;
Connecting deeds between the East
Oakland franchises and the western
end of the tunnel have not been filed
and the line is uncertain.

The case involved the validity of the
laws of California permitting the
county authorities to fix the rates to
be charged by the irrigation com
pany for water. The company claimed
the rate the county fixed was too low
and that the laws prior to 1SS5, under
which the company was organized,
were equivalent to a contract, permit
ting the company to fix its own rates.
The Circuit Court accepted this view
and decided that the act of 1S85 could
not be Invoked to impair the contract.
Justice Peckham "elivered the opin

there was no contract and adding that
even if there had been a contract the

it !s even doubtful if the courts would decide
any issue that might i>- raised.
TO SELL SOME BONDS.
In connection with the consideration of this
bill several matters have presented them
selves to your committee, matters of public
policy, which we believe ought to bÂ« clearly
defined, not only that thin board may have
a clear viÂ«w as to what its future action
ir.ay be, but that the public may have an al
equate Idea of what this board proposes to
do. and thereby give its co-operation to all
measures which n.ay from time to time be
recommended.
The report of the committee relative
to the issuance of the bonds was adopt
ed as follows:
The Board of Supervisors yesterday
passed to print an ordinance previously
referred to the Public Utilities Com
mittee providing for the sale and issu
ance of bonds in the aggregate sum of
$17,771,000 for the construction of va
rious public improvements and acqui
sition of lands for the same.
The resolution requesting. the United
Railroads to place a signal man at the
intersection of Larkin and Hayes
streets to operate the cable depressor
at this point and thus prevent acci
dents and danger to life through
enabling the conductors of the Hayes
street line to remain in charge of their
cars was- referred' to the Street Com
mittee.
The Board of Public Work3 was re
quested to submit to the Supervisors an
estimate of cost of establishing and
maintaining a convenient station at a
suitable point to be located on Market
street, -between Kearny and Sixth
streets, the station to be larger in de
sign and more commodious than the
one now established in Union square.
Providing for the full acceptance of
the "roadway of Bartlett street, between
Army and Twenty-sixth streets, paved
with bituminous rock.
The Board of Works was directed to
sell fourteen tons of old scrap iron.
The Mayor's veto of the board's reso
lution appointing W. E. Dorn to be
Justice of the Peace was referred to
the Judiciary Committee on motion of
Braunhart. who said that there was no
authority granted to the Mayor under
the charter or State law to veto such a
resolution. . .
The following ordinances were finally
passed:
Accepting a deed from Mary A. Fritz
to certain land required for the opening
and extension of Tremont avenue, from
the north boundary of the San Miguel
Rancho.
TO CONSIDER VETO.
Real estate agents Von Rhein and
Spencer JBuckbee spoke respectively
against and for the change. Rev.
Father Maximilian, pastor of St. Bon
iface Church, made an earnest request
that the resolution be notÂ» passed.
Father Augustine, assistant pastor of
the church, said it would endanger the
foundation of the building to lower the
grade.
Supervisor. Brandenstein argued that
the resolution should pass as the lower
ing of the grade would benefit the city
bv increasing assessment values and
improving the retail trade. He thought
all* differences could be adjusted by the
Board of Public "Works, to which the
matter would be referred. In moving
that the resolution be indefinitely post
poned Comte said he was opposed to
changes of grades in any part of the
citv where substantial buildings had al
ready been erected. The vote on in
definite postponement was: .
*yeÂ« â Alpers. Bent. Boxtcn. Comte. Eggers.
Finn HocVs. Lunstedt. McClellan. Rockâ 10.
Xoss â Booth. Brander-stein. r.rauncart.
D'Ancena. Payot. Rea, Sandewnâ 7.
Absentâ Connor. Â¦'--.--::
Phelan announced that whatever
damage would be sustained by St. Bon
iface Church would be paid by the large
property holders, including himself and
Captain Taylor.
Ex-Supervisor Collins, who protested
on behalf o* the Red Men's Hall As
sociation against the change, contra
dicted a statement made by Phelan that
Collins had been notified of the con
templated change before the lot for the
building was graded. Collins said the
teams had been grading for four weeks
before he was notified and the con
tracts had been let.
The Board of Supervisors yesterday
Indefinitely, postponed thÂ« proposed res
olution ot intention to lower the grade
of Golden Gate avenue at Jones anil
Leavenworth streets after a large num
ber of proponents of and opponents to
the change had been heard. .
J. D. Phelan addressed the board In
support of the lowering of the grades
ana asked that the resolution of inten
tion be passed. He argued that one of
the principal objectors to the schemfr-
St. Boniface Churchâ would not suffer
by th* change as the edifice ha.i been
constructed in anticipation of such a
project, which. If consummated, would
only liecessltate the building of a stair
case un to the entrance of the church.
In the course of his remarks Mr.
Phelan said that his side had made
no campaign to bring about the desired
change, whereupon Garret McEnerney,
attorney for those" opposed to the
scheme, produced a circular slsmed by
Phelan and others urging the receiver
to use his influence with the. Super
visors in passing the resolution.
"This scheme is a private real estate
speculation." said McEnerney. "and has
been resisted by us before twelve sue-*
cesslve boards. My client Is assessed
J12.250 for benefits. Wnat for? To
make the corners of several wealthy
men available for the building of apart
ment houses in the center of a rising
retail trade! I am of the opinion that
it will cost much more man $350,000 to
carry out the change."
L.. J. Hardy, who said he had watched
the city's growth for fifty- four years,
contended that Turk street property
would not be benefited by the change
of grade.
WILL PAY DAMAGES.
Probp.cljr the Supervisor feared he might be
aÂ«Jced' whether his evident feeling in this in
vestigation was not Inspired by the fact that
the Board' of Health had discharged his
mother-in-law. And several of thÂ» other
members of- the committee probably had simi
lar reasons for conducting this Investigation.
If the evidence had been allowed' to appear.
â¢ Mr. Ruef was asked why Dr. D'An
cona declined to be sworn. He replied:
Moreover these gentlemen undoubtedly
feared that the Mayor's ideas of economy
might be extended to ether departments where
more of. their friends nnd relatives could be
found.
The â¢ offices which were abolished, though
held to some extent by civil service em
ployes, were unnecessary and useless. The
mere fact -that five civil service employes were
hanging about the office iioln~ nothing was in
the mind of the Mayor no sufficient reason for
their retention. .
. If ! Supervisors will act thus- unfairly In
matters, of so vital Importance to the city â
will allow no hearing or presentation of evi>
dene* against their preconceived ideasâ they
will certainly forfeit the respect which other
wise would be accorded to them.
The witnesses whoÂ«e presence were desired
would have thrown light not only upon the
situation' as It Is now developed, buc would
also have Informed the board and the public
as . to many matters of Interest concerning
the civil : service generally and the methods
by- which some of the appointees are alleged
to have secured preferment upon the eligible
lists. The B-Jmmons asked of the committee
to- these various gentlemen was in the utmost
good faith and In the public interest, and it
comes with exceedingly bad grace from those
who commenced this Investigation to shut it
as soon aÂ« It reached a point where their
own claims could have been successfully con
tradicted and refuted, to say nothing cr the
personal' interest and animus which biased
some of the committee.
So barefaced an application of the policy of
suppression of facts in the Interest of favored
friends and relatlvs rvho are holding politi
cal jobs at the expense of the . taxpayers of
San Francisco hag seldom been seÂ»n in this
community. The chair evidently feared the
expose that would come through an examina
tion-of the witnesses sought to be subpesaed
and the programme was evidently arranged
before hand, since before a word was spoken
tire ."gag rule" was laid down.
This fraudulent Investigation was Initiated
merely as an attack upon Mayor Scbmltz'e
policy of retrenchment. In his effort to up
bold his ante-election pledges he had effected
an economy In the Board of Health's central
office alone of 19900 per annum, at the same
time increasing the efficiency of the depart
ment.
The high-handed and" Insulting attitude of
the chairman of the committee indicates what
was apparent all throughâ tuat the commit
tee shunned" a fair and open Investigation and
had predetermined it* course. This was evi
dent from the outset upon the adoption of
the resolution. Introduced by the chairman,
which, without hearing or trial, flagrantly al
leged ' that certain violations of the charter
had been committed, when, as a matvÂ»r of
fact, none existed.
Dr. Ward, when called to the
stand and questioned regarding the
dropping of civil service employes
and the employment of non-civil ser
vice men, stated that he did not be
lieve in blind devotion to. civil ser
vice, but was, working for the best in
terests of. the city.
â¢ Mr. Ruef was then requested to
give a list of the witnesses he wished
to. call. He started with Dr. d'Ancona
and was promptly requested to submit
a .written list. After a brief argument
he furnished the chairman with a list
containing the names of the editors
and tÂ»roprietora of local newspapers.
Dr. D'Ancona and other members of
the investigating committee. This
list Dr.. D'Ancona declared was frivo
lous, and yie refused to consider it
and refused to take the witness chair
unless the members of the committee
desired that the . persons mentioned
by Air.' Ruef be^, summoned to testify.
A brief but heated argument followed
and Erandenstein's motion to adjourn
prevailed.
-â¢CAfter" the meeting Mr. Ruef made
the following statement:
With Chairman D'Ancona of the
joint committee of the Supervisors on
Health, and Finance rapping for or
der, while A. Ruef raised his voice in
a plea that more witnesses be sum
moned, the Investigation into the ac
tions, of the Board of Health in abol
ishing some oittces and creating others
came .to a disorderly close last niyht.-
The committee has heard all the evi
dence it, cares to. and its flndinsrs will
be presented to the city's chief execu
tive at an early date.
Herbert Schmitz was the first wit
ness called.' He was questioned, as
other witnesses have been, as to why
he voted for the' abolition of certain
offices and the vacating of others, but
would give.no reply further than
that he deemed it expedient. Mr.
Brandenstein accused him of acting
blindly, and on the advice of Mr.
Ruef he refused to answer further
questions.
Dr. Stinson wa3 then called to the
stand and reauested to show the list
which at a previous hearing he ad
mitted had been submitted to him.
The doctor was unable to produce the
list, stating in explanation that he
had left it on his desk and it must
have been accidentally destroyed. So
far as he could remember, however,
the names of Drs. Rottanzi, Brackett,
Purienky and Adler had been sug
gested to him. but he had been given
no instructions.

SUPERVISORS EXD INQUIRY.
COURT SUSTAINS
CALIFORNIA LAW
"All appointments in the department shall
be made under the provisions of article XIII
of this charter, and no person so appointed by
the board shall be removed without cause."
Article XIII of the charter is one pre
scribing the civil service regulations.
This restriction touching the filling and va
cating cf places of employment has no bear-
CHARTER'S PROVISIONS.
The only restriction placed upon the powers
of the Board of Health with reference to its
employes Is in the method prescribed for the
filling and the vacating of the places of em
ployment created. That restriction is found
In the latter part of section 5 of article X
of the charter, and is in these words: .
"When any place of employment Is created
cr abolished or the compensation attached
thereto altered thÂ«- officer cr board making
such chanicÂ«? ?hall Immediately report In writ
ing to the (Civil Service) Commissioners." -
The right to abolish old place* and to create
new one* is Â»ceciflcally recomized by section
1" of article XIII of the charter in th'se
words:
There can be no question that the sole and
exclusive power and jurisdiction to create
places of employment In the Department of
Public Health Is by this provision of the char
tÂ«r conferred ur>on the Board of Health: that
the. judgment cf the Board of Health is the
so!o criterion for determinfnE the kind and
number of place3 of employment that shall ex
ist in the Department of Public Health. There
can also be no doubt that the power conferred
include the richt to abolish places once cre
ated and the right to create n^w places not
previously existing, and that these rights may
be exercised freely and unrestrainedly without
consultation with any of the drpartments of
the city government.
"The board may appoint such officer*,
agents and employes as may be necessary for
the proper and efficient carrying out and en
forcement of the purposes and duties of the
board, and may fix their salaries and pre
scribe their duties.
\Hth resueet to the Department of Public
Health, however, no place* of employment are
created by the charter. The power to create
place? of employment for this department la
specifically conferred upon the Board of Health
by the charter, section 5 of article X. That
section is as follows:
BOARD HAS POWER.
With rtSDect to these deDartmenta no auch
controversy as has arisen in the Board of
Health can therefore possibly arise.
It seems essential, therefore, that Â»t the
outset of tbla investigation the law bearing
upon these rights m**erted by the Board of
Health, which it has undoubtedly exercleed,
and which rights are contested, should be un
equivocally declared and defined.
The various DOfitions under the charter
filled either by temporary or permanent em
ploys ar* by that document referred to as
places of employment.
With respect to most of the departments un
dcr the city sovernmezit tho charter it***it
creates thrse places of employment. For In
stance, with respect to the Auditor it has pro
vided that lie may acpolnt a deputy auditor,
two assistant deputies, two clerks *jid auch
other clerk* as may be need'd. f he samo
pi\Msion is made with respect to most of the
departments of the city rovernment provided
for by the charter.
Among: the various rrounds of protects urc*d
against the resolutions of the honorable Board
of Health, whereby said BoaM of Health
sought to reorganize the department ander Its
control, the right of thÂ« Board of Health to
abolish places tilled by civil service employes
without the previous nanctlcn of the Civil
Sen-Ice Commissioners and the richt of the
beard to create n*w daces without such like
previous sanction of the Civil Service Commis
sioners â¢eem.Â« to be rocst strenuously con
tested and denied.
The hearing of the case of the de
posed employes of the Board of Health
was resumed before the Civil Service
Commissioners yesterday^ afternoon.
At the opening of the session Chairman
Rogers announced that the commission
had carefully considered the question
raised as to the right of the Health
Board to abolish certain positions and
create others under a different desig
nation. The opinion, which, to satisfy
all parties, was put in writing, states
that it is the unanimous decision of the
Civil Service Commissioners that the
members of the Board of Health did
not exceed their authority in abolishing
certain positions and establishing oth
ers. The opinion in full is as follows:
Measure Plans the Disposal of
Some of the Series That
1 Portion of Work Mav Be Done
Additional Appropriation Is
Made and the Health Board's
Salary Fond May Be Used
Society for Prevention of Cruel
ty to Animals to Have Tem
porary Charge of the Place
Judiciary Committee AVill Take
Up Disapproval of Appoint
ment of Dorn as a Justice
ure in office. The hearing will be re
sumed at 2 o'clock to-morrow after
noon.
Deputy Health. Officer Eevr.. who ia
filling the positions of -".several of the
deposed' employes, again testified re
garding- his multifarious - duties. He
claims that they are - not . merely, cleri
cal, 35 has been contended, but also
executive. Inasmuch -as he fills the of
fice of the chief health officer during
the latter's absence.
Dr. Green, one of the deposed sani
tary inspectors, was suLJeccd to- a
rigid cross-examination by Mr. Ruef.
Green occupied the position of sanitary
inspector before It was placed on the
classified list and Ruef attempted inef
fectually to force from him an admis
sion that the Sanitary Inspectors had
suggested the holding of an examina
tion that they might ?e ; Â¦--. life ten-
The afternoon's proceeding ; brouffht
out very little which. has not* already
been shown. Secretary Moran of. the
Civil Service Commission testified that
two examinations for sanitary inspec
tors have been held and that there are
two names still on the, eligible list.," He
further, stated that when the examina
tion were being prepared the
former Health Board "had Â¦ suggested
that experience in medicine â¢ be' in
cluded, i â¢ â¢ . ' ' '
Ing- however, upon th* question of their crea
tion or termination. Whether tht^ restriction
upon .the Board of Hcalfa has been violated
by It Is <he purpose of this Investigation.
We know of no other provision* â¢ of the
charter touching upon the power to creare or
abolish places of employment In the Depart
ment of Public Health. â¢
As bearing upon the question of the power
of departments to creat* and abolish places
of employment, this commission has been per
suaded very largely -in coming to the conclu
sion herein expressed by an opinion of City
Attorney Franklin K. Lane, rendered
April 1!Â». 1901. *nd found In the official re
ports of the opinions ot the City Attorney of
San Franc!Â«co from 1S9Â» to 1002. at page 481.
The opinion relate to the power of the Board
of Public Works to create an official position
without the consent of the Board of Civil
Service Commissioner*, and expressly recog
nizes this right. The opinion Is too lengthy to
be quoted In full. We. however, quote thÂ«
following:. -
"I think that the position of the Board of
Public Works Is clearly right. To such board
has been given full power to determine wliat
clerks and employes are necessary for the
conduct of ih;. business of that department.'
They are responsible for tne conduct of this
branch ot the municipal government. Within
the limitations ot the charter aÂ» to the dis
position of their appropriation they are ab
solute. If they create unnecessary places the
remedy lies not with the Civil Service Com
mission, but ultimately with the Mayor. The
Civil Service Commission Is created to sea that
appointments to ofSce and removals therefrom
procedure provided. T*ie!r business primarily
Is to see that proper arid fit persons are se
lected as officers and employes .under tli-Â»
rcerit system. And If there does not happen
to.be a properly qualified person for any
position that is vacant, their consent or ap
proval Is required to the appointment of a.
temporary appointee, who shall hold until an
examination can b<> held and a list of qualified
persons obtained. The commission may withhold
its approval of any temporary appointment
upen the. ground that the proposed appointee
is tiot fitted for the petition or upon the ground
that a temporary appointment Is not necessary
because a qualified list of ellglbles Us waiting
from which a regular appointment may - be
made. But the Civil 'Service Commissioners
should not reject a nomination upon the
ground that in their judgment such an office
or employment Is unnecessary In such depart
rr:?n:. If it were illegal to create such a place
that would be another matter,, but the case
presented does not give 4 rise to such question."
PROTEST OVERRULED.
The ground of protect that the Beard . of
Health has no power to abolish places of em
ployment, or to create new places of employ
ment without ~first obtaining the " sanction - of
the Civil Service Commissioners, Is therefore
held to be untenable ' and It Is overruled.

BALLOON â Reader. Oakland. Cal.
The credit of having reachedtrw* high
est altitude in a balloon is given to
Drs. Bersen and Suring of Berlin.
They rose to rv height of 30.000 feet,
both losing consciousness for a brief
interval.^ They continued to Mcend
to 33.000 feet, when one of them.be
came completely unconscious and
could not te aroused. The other
pulled the valve and then became in
sensible. Neither recovered con
sciousness until the balloon had
dropped to 16.000 feet.
A. S is well known to all persons interested in com
mercial matters, there has been for a long time' an
urgent need for increasing the powers of the In
terstate Commerce Commission, so_ as to give it ample
authority to deal with the abuses of railway management
by " which certain shippers are given advantage over
others. The commission itself has/in its' report's to^.Con- ;
gress, .repeatedly pointed out the need of i increased pow
ers, and again and again has cited specific instances of

Longstreet's Bravery.
A writer in the Atlanta Constitution
gives some highly interesting anecdotes
concerning the life of General Long
.street, the famous Con Moderate leader,
who recently passed away. Of Long
street'a actipns at Gettysburg the
! writer says:
I "Every Confederate who ever saw
i General Longstreet in battle ranks says
! that he seemed to be oblivious to dan
ger. As to the Gettysburg reports. Col
onel McBride - said: 'Longstreet, al
though a prudent and cautious fighter,
was not only always ready to fight, but
he was always anxious and wanted to
fight. On the second day he was not
slow, but was simply putting himself
in shape to do the bloodiest fight of the
; war. At least two-thirds, of the casual
'Â¦ ties in America's greatest battle hap
pened, in front of Longstreet' s corps.
Reports show this. " The records also
show that he only obeyed Lee's orders
! to the letter.
".'At Sharpsburg, General Longstreet
rode along the lines where, the battle
was forging thick. General Hill and
other officers begged him" to dismount
as a matter of safety^ \ He .would not

the reasons why they were late. "It
invariably happens that the first man
makes an entry that "his wheel broke

this excuse by marking underneath

Cat in Sick Ward.
The London Mall tells the fo'Iowing
odd story of a cat at a receiving hos
pital: ".r!> .'...>
" 'Lady Gertie' is one of the model
patients of the London Hospital. Sha
is at present in the Sisters' room in a
children's ward, and although she is
only a subdued-looking black kitten
with her tail in a white bandage, hei
admission is quite regularized by thi
fact that she has a 'card,' a tempera
ture chart and visitors.
"A boy brought her to the receiving
room a fortnight ago, witn the simple
explanation that she had been run over
by a cart, so pussy was given a card
marked 'P. F. O.' (prepare for opera
tion), and was attended to by* a housa
surgeon.
"At first there was little hope of sav
ing the tail, which had been badly
crushed, but bandages and boracio
dressing did wonders, and Lady Gertie
will only be abbreviated by about an
inch and a half."
WHILE old and weather-worn Democrats, sea
soned and scarred by the vicissitudes of many
seasons and skilled in observing the direction of
the wind and in the flavor of. pie at the official counter,
are feeling around for an issue for this year the boom of
Mr. William Randolph Hearst goes on booming like a
whistling buoy.
â¢ Already East Oakland was organized for him, with an
irresistible club of ten charter members, and the 'Steenth
Ward Club of Los Angeles had painted a transparency
expressive of his public and private virtues and ascriptive
to his statesmanship. But there was something lacking, a
long felt want, an aching void like that caused by an
omitted lunch. His friends had noted, with pained sur
prise, that of his fellow members of Congress only three
had declared for him.
Judge Wade, the lone member of the party from Iowa,
in drawing seats got one next to Hearst, and in Novem
ber-had said to his constituency that to sit beside such
an augustness was a greater honor than to have -been
elected to the opportunity. He has sat within catching
distance of Hearst's statecraft and had every chance to
get it if it is contagious, but now finds it necessary to go
home and deny to his constituents in Davenport that he
will support Hearst for the Presidency. He also says that
Iowa is hopelessly Republican and may as well follow the
band, wagon and not try to drive the team.
This positive repudiation of his November attitude set
people to wondering. They asked themselves in whis
pers if close acquaintance with Mr. Hearst dispelled the
illusion of his greatness? What ailed him was what both
ered those that read in his newspapers that he is the
greatest thing that ever happened in this country. Had
they not read that he gave every constituent a turkey on
Christmas; that he had gone out and busted. the trusts
like they were egg shells; that. he was mapping out the
policy of the party in Congress, and that Senator Jo
Bailey was merely a brazen trumpet through which
Hearst's ideas reached the world? So what was the
matter any way with this .phenomenon among the phe
nomenal phenomena of the world of statesmen?
If he could not carry more than three votes in Con
gress, what could he do in the District of Columbia,
where nobody votes at all? Surely the non-voting folk
of the district see him come and go. They note the
brazen statue of General Rawlins turn uneasily on its
'pedestal as he goes to his daily duty up Pennsylvania ave
nue'. They see the marble statue of Ben Franklin smile
and bow to him as he goes by, while the nude female fig
ures at the base of the peace monument at the foot of
Capital Hill call for the police when he approaches and
the Jovian statue of Washington, shivering shirtless in
the cold, cries out, "Eclipse, penumbra, shade, shadow
and forgetfulness are mine. Hearsed am I, and Hearst
doth bestride my fame!" and have hoped that these mar
vels would impress the people.
Well, they have. . We read in the* Examiner that Mr.
James Bilkey of. South Washington called his neighbors
in to form a William Randolph Hearst Presidential Club.
William Soar and Robert Head, Philetus Legge and Jef
ferson Davis Grub responded and the club flung its de
fiant banner and candidate to the breeze. We have not
room for the eulogy pronounced by. Mr. Grub. It may
be found in full in Mr. Hearst's papers. His modesty
forbade him to give it to the Associated Press. It merely
says what every one may run and read in the Hearst
papers, to wit, that Washington, Jefferson and Lincoln
were well-, meaning, people, but /have been greatly over
rated in history, while Grant. Cleveland and McKinley
were- accidents and disgraces to their country.
The Goddess of Liberty has waited ever since 1776 for
a man of , her size to take charge of the Temple of Free
dom, keep the plumbing in order, have the lawn mowed,
stand off bill collectors, shake down the furnace and keep
the place fit. Such a man has now evolved and is to be
put at work at once N unless the people wish to be serfs
and perhaps worse. Of course his name in full is Wil
liam Randolph Hearst..
This ends widespread anxiety. The leader of. leaders
leads m South . Washington, D. C. His boom is real, it
is earnest and the waste basket is not its goal' The
movement- will now proceed. to. spread witji all. four feet.

'An III Wind.
He and she drifted into the County
Clerk's office in Oakland, targets for
the gaze of the curious. It was a 100
to 1 shot they wanted the cupid bu
reau. To a newspaper man who spied
the pair they figured for a story. The
reporter approached them.
Yes, they wanted to be married.
They had run away from home and
had come to Oakland, but, alas, at
the last moment the bridegroom learn
ed that a marriage license cost $2 and
his pockets yielded only $1 05.
"Tell you what I'll do," said the re
porter. "If you'll come up the street
with me and sit for your photographs
I'll buy the license and will see that
you are married without a cent of
cost And more than that, you shall
be my guests at a wedding breakfast."
It was a way out of trouble that
the smiling pair had not dreamed of.
A nod from the miss settled it. Oft
the reporter and his guests hurried.
Quickly a photographer posed the bri
dal couple. That done, the newspaper
man filled on his end of the contract,
bought license and got the services of
a Justice of the Peace. After the wed
ding the party repaired to a restaurant
and celebrated.
The following day a pretty runaway
marriage story was given to the news
paper's readers, but the secret of its
getting has been buried until now.
The Korean press has unswung its goose quills and

manifest to the Emperor of Korea that he has too many

angry he -will not do so. He Is ridden
on the spinal cord by the bridle, and
sadly the driver places his foots on the
stirrups and divides his lower llmba
across the saddle and drives his animal
to the meadow. He has four legs; two
are on the front side and two are after
ward. These are the weapons on which
he runs. He also defends himself by
extending these in the rear in a parallel
direction toward his- foe, but this hi
does only when he is in an aggravating
mood. There Is no animal like tha
horse. No sooner they see their guar
dian or master than they always cry
for food, but it 13 always at the morn

To the casual observer the moun
tains seem a type of eternity. We nat
uralJy speak of th? hills as "everlast
ing." A favorite mode of expressing
future eternity is to say "as long as
the world endureth." Even to the
j stronomer, with h!s most perfected
instruments for measurement of both
space and force, no variation in the
diameter of either the earth or the
sun has been discovered. This, how
ever, is not because no changes are
taking place, but because they are so
slow a^i man so shprt lived that they
do not make themselves perceptible to
our dull senses. In reality there is no
absoluie uniformity in nature. Every-*
thing is changing. To-morrow will
not be like to-day, and to-day is not
like yesterday. What were the con
ditions a million years ago and what
they Â¦will be a million years hence are
largely matters of conjecture. Still
we have data enough to make specula
tion interesting, if not perfectly con
clusive.
That the whole solar system is pass
ing through changes which would
have made the world uninhabitable r.t
some timo in the past, and will make
it uninhabitable in the future, follows
from the recently established law of the
"conservation of energy." According
to this law force is as indestructible
as matter. Heat, light, gravitation,
electricity and all other forms of force
are interchangeable without loss. The
force that runs a steam engine is
transformed heat. The power de
veloped by placing a wheel under
Niagara is transformed gravitation,
and in the ultimate analysis trans
formed heat of the sun. The water
was lifted through ' evaporation to a
height from which it could fall and
so transfer the force of gravitation
acting upon it to a revolving wheel,
which in turn transforms it into elec
tricity, which runs the streetcars of
Buffalo and furnishes light for its
halls and homes.
But every one knows that heat is
not uncaused. It must have a source
of supply. The coal bin is not inex
haustible. The glowing stove will cool
if there is not a constant supply of fuel.
The warming pan will not be of ser
vice long if its heat is not renewed.
Hence we infer that the sun must be
a cooling body; for heat is radiating
lrom it at an enormous rate. Only a
little of this heat is arrested by the
earth. When we think of the scorch
ing rays of the sun which fall con
stantly upon the tropics, it seems as
though it were a great deal. But when
we reflect how small a space the earth
fills in the solar system we shall bet
ter appreciate how great is the amount
of heat from the sun which is con
stantly being wasted. So small is the
world that where it receives one unit
of heat from the sun -2. 1.70,000, 000
units go off into space to be lost for
ever.
This brings us to the question,
whence does the gun. derive its suppiy
of heat, and is that supply inexhausti
ble? Astronomers and physicists with
one accord tell us that its heat is not
inexhaustible, but differ somewhat in
guessing what the source is. Some
have thought that the sun was heated
up by having a constant stream of me
teors falling into it. We know that
whenever the motion of a solid body is
suddenly arrested this motion is
changed into heat. I have seen a cold
piece of iron made red hot in a minute
by the rapid lusty blows of a black
smith's hammer upon it. Meteorites
when they fall to the earth are always
pmoki'ig hot. This is caused by the
friction of the air. But if meteorites
were falling through space thick enough
to keep up the heat of the sun so many
would strike the earth that it, too,
vould ho red hot. '
Allied to thl3 theory is that of the de
rivation of the sun's heat from the con
traction of its dianieter. The present
siz* of the sun is maintained by the
expansive power of the heat within it.
But as the rim slowly contracts
through the constant action of gravi
ts.t!oa the dtgree of heat is kept up,
and indeed intensified, so that the sun
is now hotter than TF~used to be, but
being also smaller does not radiate as
much as it once did. It- is estimated
that to produce the present amount of
heat the diameter of the sun must con
tract 2ZQ feet per year, <or a mile in
twenty.flve yearsâ four* miles a cen
tury. Though this is too small an
amount to have been noted by i any
Â¦present -means of measurement since
accurate observations -began .to be
made, it is by .no means , an . insignifi
cant amount, andpoints to limits both
in the past and future.
It Is estimated that if all the matter
in the Eolar system had been moving
from the utmost bounds of space to
ward the' center of the sun It would
furnish heat at the present rate for
only IS.000,000 years. But It is probable
that formerly the radiation of the sun,
when it filled mnch larger space than
now, was greater than at. present. It
is a rather startling fact that if the
sun's heat were increased by 'much
more than one-half it would boil away
all the v.?.lor on the globe. As water
i? necessary to life on the globe. Pro
fessor rCcv.-corr.b, our great authority
at Wnsbinstcn, thinks that ."the bal
ance of c2urcs which would result in

WE regarded the first protests against, seating
Apostle Smoot as, a Senator as f idle, for the
reason that it could not be proved, that heÂ° was
constitutionally ineligible. We adhere to. that convic
tion. According to the requirements of the constitution
lie is a citizen of the United States and of the State of
Utah. He is eligible to a seat in the Senate. Since the
first grounds upon which the denial of his seat' was
asked, there has been added the charge that oaths taken
in the secret ceremonies of the Morton church, in the
''Temple work," so called, conflict with a Mormon's alle
giance to this Government. This may well be so, since
the secret ceremonial and the ritual part of Mormonism
was enriched with the hatred that was caused by the per
secution of the church at Nauvoo and during the hegira.
Reasoning simply from the conjunction of human na
ture and religious fanaticism with such circumstances,
we do not doubt that oaths and obligations went into the
ritual that put the church above the state. But, even if
the text of such oaths is revealed and put in evidence,
we know of no way by which Congress can divest a man
of his citizenship for taking such an path.
The legal question involved is â¢novel 'and. of. great in
terest. A man may be divested of his citizenship, by
conviction of crime. But Apostle Smoot has not been con
victed of crime, and no lawyer has j'et said how a crimi
nal information or indictment can be framed against him
for taking the secret oath with which he is charged.
Crimes are statutorj', and there is no statute defining the
taking of such an oath as a crime, therefore no indict
ment can lie. Treasfcm is denned by the constitution as
"levying war against the United States, or giving aid
and comfort to the enemies thereof." But the statute of
treason which enforces that provision of the constitu
tion does not include the alleged oath. r:As John G.
Carlisle will present the case against Smoot/ .the popular
knowledge will be greatly enriched by information on' a
subject involving an aspect of citizenship of the greatest
interest. 'Â¦Â¦ Â¦
Passing from that phase of the question 'with 'the "cer
tainty that he can be divested of eligibility to his seat
only by divesting him first of citizenship, which can be
done only by his judicial conviction of a statutory crime,
we cannot overlook other issues raised in the apostle's
very diffusive defense. He, in effect, puts .the Mormon
church on trial in his rejoinder to the charges against
himself. A lawyer whb reads it will be amazed that a
lawyer wrote it.- The only issue raised which the Senate
could act upon being the guilt or innocence of the apos
tle of the statutory crime oi\ polygamy, the answer im
pleads the whole practice and policy of the Mormon
church. It denies that, polygamy is any longer sanc
tioned by the church, but admits that it is practiced by
a few individuals on their personal responsibility and lia
bility to answer to the law. 'Now how can a Mormon
make a polygamous marriage except by the sanction of
the church? He must receive the church sanction and
go through the, church ceremony.
It is alleged that . the present head of the church,
Joseph Smith, lives with- five^wives and has become
the father of twenty-two i-chilprcn since' the church
manifesto receding from polygamy, which was the key
that opened the door for Utah to enter the Union. The
apostle's answer makes it incumbent upon the Senate to
inquire into the domestic arrangements of the president
of the church. It is true that the document protests
against any evidence being introduced except uponSmoot's
personal eligibility, and declares evidence on other issues
to be irrelevant, impertinent and immaterial. But he has
not the power nor the right to limit evidence, having
himself raised issues that are necessarily controvertible.
He does this by denying that he has- ever countenanced,
aided, honored or preferred any person who has violated
the law. This makes necessary an inquiry by evidence
into his relations to the president of the church, and in
quiry into President Smith's alleged continued practice
It is evident that in the future we are to have a suc
cession of such issues as have been raised by the apos
tle's election to the Senate, and that prospect should
cause now the fullest examination into every question
raised in his answer, and there should be a decision
which will settle the permanent policy of the Senate. In
the case of Brigham Roberts, the House blundered. It
began by depriving him of his constitutional right to ;
take the oath and his seat upon presentation of his cer
tificate of election, which is prima facie! evidence of title,
to the seat. This initial blunder made the subsequent
action of the House valueless as a precedent. The Sen
ate is avoiding that error and will furnish a precedent
useful to the country. * ; *;,' v ; '"/â¢''â¢.*Â¦*
Apostle Smoot and the Mormon hierarchy do not un
derstand the sentiment of the country, which is that po
lygamy is morally wrong, that is malum in.se and not
malum prohibitumâ wrong in itself and not wrong only
because it is prohibited. Therefore the country perfect
ly well understands that in the Mormon mind and teach
ings there is a conflict between what the church con
siders to be moral and what the law and the Gentile
conscience consider immoral. Under such circumstances
it is well understood by the country that the church has
the most powerful motive for controlling the politics of
enough States to prevent polygamy being made a Fed
eral question, as it can be by an anti-polygamy amend
ment to the constitution. When they can prevent that
they are at liberty to repeal the anti-polygamy statutes
of a State and conform the law to their fdea of morals.
This is the great question at issue, and it is of, equal
gravity with the former question of "slavery, which was
domestic to the States until the thirteenth amendment
made it a Federal concern.
'A Talc of Whiskers.
Deputy Coroner Streightif over In
Berkeley is renowned the county over
for the fearful and wonderful growth
of whisker which adorns his official
countenance. It is waist-long, a fiery,
uncompromising red. pugnacious. When
j Streightif presides at an obsequies the
beard leaves no adornment to be de
sired.
Recently one of the Berkeley corre
spondents for a city paper caught a
fleeting glimpse of Streightif with most
j of the . whisker apparently gone; It
i seemed that some cruel hand had shorn
j him like Samson and only a mere wisp
j of the former glory remained in mourn
! ful mernoriam of what had once been.
Wildly the reporter rang up his chief
with the startling announcement,
j "Streishtifs lost his whiskers." Im
j mediately the message came back hot
j over the wire: "Will send a cartoonist
I from . the city. Write a comic of at
j least 500 words â history of the whis
! kers, how the college town mourn3
their loss, etc."
The cartoonist arrived and together
the two newspaper men went around
to the branch Morgue to interview and
| sketch the shorn deputy. Streightif
Ifhad his back turned from the door
when the twain entered. Merrily the
reporter hailed him. "Oh, Streightif,
we want to learn all about how you
I lost your whiskers."
The official gravely turned about and
with one hand drew forth the flaming
insignia from where it had been snugly
tucked away under his vest. "Young
man," quoth the Injured Streightif,
"don't you get too fresh."
THE SMOOT CASE.
state has probably not existed more
lhan 10,000,000 years," and that this is
therefore "near' the extreme limit of
time that we can suppose water to have
existed on the earth in the fluid state."
'. Eut, though (he. mathematicians in
s'st that some, such limit as 10.000,000
or 23,003,000 years must be placed upon
the existence of even the lowest forms
of life on the earth, geologists still con
tend for a longer' lease of time. Rea
soning from the known rate at which
f*rmsÂ«of 15fe change, Darwin and Lyell
assumed that It must have been on the
earth for many hundred million years.
Darwin, indeed, in his earlier editions
of "The Origin of Species," speaks of
366,000.000 years as a mere trifle of geo
logic time. But the geologists of the
Â¦present day are more modest in their
demands, and would, apparently, be
Fatlsn>d with 100.000,000 or â¢twice that
number of years. Alfred Russell Wal
lace, however, from geological evidence
calculates that 30,000,000 years is all
that reed be demanded for the facts
ot geology.
Wallace's estimate is an interesting
one. Taking the thicknera of the sedi
mentary rocks at 117,200 feet, which is
8n extreme estimate, and reckoning the
coast line of the globe at 100,000 mile;?,
and that the sediment brought into the
sea is dÂ«ocsitea on an average over a
belt thirty miles wide, he finds that at
the present rate the total thickness of
rocks would be formed within the above
mentioned length of time. For, at the
present rate of erosion of the conti
nents, the whole land surface of the
parth is lowered one foot in 3000 years
and the sediment deposited along the
shores of the continents. One foot from
57,000,000 square miles (the land surface
of the earth), is equal to nineteen feet
deposited in 2000 years over the bait
stretching thirty miles out from 100,000
miles of shore line: 177,:00 divided by
19 multiplied by 3000 equals 28,000.000.
Such is the reduction to the age of
the world made by more recent investi
gations both of astronomers and geolo
gists. Assuming the truth of the nebu
lar hypothesis, Professor George H.
Darwin obtained results remarkably
rimilar from calculations, concerning
the relations of the moon to the earth.
The moon produces tides upon the earth
and conversely the earth must pro
duce tides upon the moon. As was long
ago shown these tides retard the daily
motion of the revolution of these bodies.
The tides are equivalent to a wave on
the earth about three feet high, strik
ing twice a day on the eastern shore
of the continents. This has the same
effect as a brake on a wheel, and im
perceptibly but surely retards its mo
tion. As the moon is much smaller
than the earth and hence has less mo
mentum, its motion has been affected
much more by its tides than has that
of the earth. Whereas, the moon once
revolved on its axis very rapidly, it now
requires a whole month to revolve, and
so keeps the same face toward the
earth all the time. r .'u/ :
By Darwin's calculation it was shown
that formerly the earth revolved on its
axis once every eight hours, but was
reduced to its present rate by the same
process that has reduced the moon.
At the time when the moon and
earth were revolving so rapidly they
were much nearer to each other than
now; indeed, so near that the tides
they produced on each other were many
times as great as those now produced;
so great, indeed, was the tidal wave
which then rolled over the world that
it is hardly possible to suppose that
any form of life could have endured the
conditions.
Going further, Darwin proved that
the moon was originally thrown off
from the mass of the earth by the In
creased centrifugal motion of the con
tracting sphere of the earth, as water
is thrown off from a grindstone. Fur
thermore, by his calculations of the re
tarding influence of the tides, he
proves that this could not have oc
curred less than 50,000,000 nor more
than 100.000,000 years ago. All geologic
time, therefore, must be brought much
within these limits, for after the birth
of the moon an immensely long period
must have elapsed before the condi
tions were such upon the earth that
life could have endured them. So that
his calculations agree in a remarkable
manner with those of Mr. Wallace and
of Professor Newcomb.
But 1,000,000 years is a long time, and
slowly working causes produce im
mense results within that period. As
Darwin remarks, "Few of us know
what a million really means. Take a
narrow strip of paper S3 feet 4 inches
in length and stretch it along the wall
of a large hall: then mark off at one
end the tenth of an inch. This tenth of
an inch will represent 100 years, and
the atrip a million years." Bearing this
in mind, we shall appreciate the fol
lowing calculations concerning the
great length of the geological periods
even on Mr. Wallace's estimate of the
total length of geological time, and
they. will seem sufficiently long for all
necessary purposes.
Vignette of Dickens.
Charles Dickens, it was often said,
was above all things an actor. He was
indeed an actor, and a consummate one.
He wa3 never when in public what in
the ordinary sense of the word is
"termed natural." I saw him again and
again at these Guild meetings; I heard
him address various public assem
blages, and I listened, I think, to each
of his public readings, and in all he had
consciously an ideal in his mind, up to
which he may be said to have acted. His
characters have been counted, and thÂ»Â»y
run Into hundreds and hundreds. He
must have created them as he walked
and 1 ode and conversed or mused. The
situation in which he found himself
for the time became an ideal one forth
with, and his part a part with the. rest.
I once saw him hurry forward. In St.
James Square to help a policeman who
was struggling with a desperate fel
low whom he had arrested for stealing
lead. My friend Mr. J. C. Parkinson,
well known to and much liked by Mr.
Dickens, was with me, and .we hast
ened to assist. I really trembled, for
the man looked savagely at Mr. Dick
e:is. and in another moment a blow
might have fallen. "I'll go. with you to
the station," said Mr. Dickens to the
policeman, and he did. Even then his
voice, his air. his walk made me think
of pome accomplished artist called upon
to represent all this 6a the stage.-â

at the same time it gives the commission power to ren
der really valuable service to the community by the cor

dress. It is to be noted that the authority thus given is
by no means new, for it was exercised by the commis

however, denied by the Supreme Court on the ground
that it was not expressly conferred by the terms of the

LOS ANGELES. Jan. 18.â The riding
of E. Walsh, who piloted three win
ners, and three close finishes were the
features of to-day's racing at Ascot.
One favorite, four second choices and
the third choice earned winning brack
ets. The hardest knock the talent got
ivas in the fourth race, which The Go!d
f.nder won from Rag Tag, the odds-on
favorite. The track was a trille slow
after last night's rain ana the attend
ance was -100.
Nona B. at 3 to 1, was the first win

XOTKS OK THE TRACK.
Henry Spencer, the original arid only
"Iceman." who has sent the cold shiv
ers creeping down the spinal column of
bettors of two hemispheres through
his eyelash finishes, spoiled a good
thing in the first race. Henry had the
mount on Celebrant, a 9 to 1 chance,
and after carefully rating the outsider
collared and downed Dungannon a
nose. The latter was played from, 6
down to 4V6- Kunz on the favorite,
The Cure, apparently beat the barrier
and then pulled up. Doris swerved,
spoiling the chances of half the field.
Marie J. favorite for the two-year
old dash, finished second, being easily
beaten by Meada, one of the second
choices, piloted by Willie See. Meada
is a daughter of Figaro, and the first
time the started was plunged on. A
bit of hard luck at the start on that oc
casion hurt her chances. Yesterday shr
was thp recipient of good handling, and
after the favorite, Arisbe and Raga
manda had raced heads apart almost to
the paddock See let Meada down, and
the black filly breezed in first. Marie
J took the place from Arisbe by a neck.
Both Double Six and Letola were ab
sentees from the third event, at five
and Â¦ half furlongs, which left Johnny
Schorr's Ananias a 3 to 5 favorite.
Creedmore a 100 to 1 shot backed down
to 15, almost furnished the surprise.
C. Smith got the despised outsider
away well, anrl Hildebrand, astride the
first choice, was compelled to do some
tall hustling to get up and score by
a couple of lengths. Goddess of Night
finished a close third.
Dell Fountain's Modicum made a run
away race of the mile and a sixteenth
selling number. The bay horse is af
flicted v/ith ringbones and the slushy
going was Ju?t to his liking. Kunz
had the mount and placed the Fountain
entry over the plate ahead of the fa
vorite. Horton. wita plenty to spare.
Chickadee was third.
Colonel Van, also a member of the
Fountain stable, was tho peo - !e's choice
for the six-furlong selling run next de
cided, and was elected by a useful ma
jority. The Colonel had his price ham
mered down from 3 to 2 to 1. Hilde
brand piloted this one, and after avoid
ing the earlv pace defeated Matt Ho
gan with apparent ease. Lansdowne,
a well-played one, finished in the show.
Poor little Daisy Green appears un
able to gather any sea shells on these
shores. Not so many days back the
Eastern mare was stanchly played to
beat Incubator and failed to do so.
Daisy has always been considered
right at home in muddy going, and
with Gold Money and Joe Lesser out
of the way fell in for a raft of backing
to take the last event, a mile and sev
enty yard purse affair, at Oakland
yesterday. As it happened Kenilworth.
the "brown bird." came out with his
claws freshly manicured and led from
start to finish, winning, all out at the
wire, a head before the 10 to 1 shot.
Soothsayer. The favorite ran second
until well into the stretch. . where she
gave up the- ghost, finishing third.
A sloppy track worked wonders in
the way of improvement with two or
three different performers. Ananias
and Col. Van were, the only two favor
ites to land. The attendance â¢â¢.r..i * 3od.

George Peterson and Joe Thomas are

These boys are evenly matched and
when they clash a warm battle will be
the result. George Murray and Wil
liam Stewart, the navy champion, will
do the honors in the light heavy-weight
class. Bob Lundie and Jack Burke are
on the boards for the lightweight bout,
Abe Label and Al Elkins for the

Young Corbett may engage in a
fistic encounter In this city next month
with Dave Sullivan, the New York
featherweight, as an opponent. A dis r
patch was received, from New York
last night to that effect, but none of
the fight promoters about town were
able to verify it "and they simply
passed it off as an idle rumor.
The dispatch states that Corbett and
Sullivan were matched there and that
the light would surely take place in
this city. The Yosemite Club has the
permit for February and has already
matched Hugo Kelly and another
Eastern lightweight, so it does not
seem possible that Corbett and Sulli
van would meet.
It is the opinion of sporting men
about town that Sullivan simply wants
to come to the coast and break in here
and a match with Corbett would mean
a whole lot of advertising for the New
Yorker. However, no one seems to
concede him a chance with the Den
ver whirlwind.
All is in readiness for the big amateur
boxing exhibition to be given to-night
at the Mechanics' Pavilion under the
auspices of the Lincoln Athletic Club.
Six bouts are carded for the attraction,
and if the lads make the showing that
is expected of them the exhibition will
certainly prove the greatest amateur
event that has ever been pulled oft in
this city.
Sam Berger, the well-known heavy
weight of the Olympic Club, and George
Sullivan,' the husky scrapper from the
San Francisco Club, will put on the
mitts in the final event of the evening.
This fight has been looked forward to
by ring-goers for many months. It
ought to be an engagement worth go
ing miles to see, as both men are ama
teurs who are capable of lighting like
real professionals, and there is no rea
son why their four-round bout should
not prove as interesting as any mill be
tween much heralded Eastern stars.
BLOOMIXGTON, 111., Jan. 18. â The
striking street railway employes who
went out on January 1 for increased
wages instituted a. competitive auto
mobile service to-day.
Strikers Start an Auto Service.
Attorneys for the Royal Consolidated
Mines Company, limited, and those for
the striking miners at Hodson. Cala
veras County, occupied the whole of
yesterday's session of the United States
Circuit Court in the argument on the
motion to make perpetual the tempo
rary restraining order heretofore issued
against the strikers.
Among the affidavits read to the
court on a previous occasion was one
by Charles Wilson, a teamster in the
service of the complainant company.
He stated that on December 9 he was
taken out of his barn at Milton by a
gang of twenty-five strikers led b'y Ben
Box and Frank Rochester and com
pelled under threats of death to walk
with them a quarter of a mile up
the railroad track to a pond, into which
he was ordered by Rochester, who
threatened to kill him should he re
fuse to do so. While Wilson was in
the water Rochester ordered him to
put his head under the surface, which
he was obliged to do through fear of
great bodily injury should he refuse.
After he got out of the pond George
Meehan and Rochester threw him back
into the water, and when they got
through ducking him they took him
some distance down the railroad track
and ordered him to leave the country,
giving him the alternative of being
killed. Wilson said that this brutal
treatment was in pursuance of .threats
made against him by the strikers be
cause he had persisted in working for
the company while the strike was on.
An affidavit by George Meehan was
read at yesterday morning's session.
He flatly denied that any threats had
been made against or that any violence
whatever had been offered to Wilson.
He swore that Wilson, freely and of his
own volition, walked down the railroad
track with them and after discussing In
a lamblike manner Wilson's conduct in
refusing to leave the employment of
the complainant at the suggestion of
the strikers Wilson said that he realized
that he had teen acting In a very rep
rehensible manner toward his fellow
workmen by working while the rest
were striking, and then and there,
freely and of his own volition, said
.that he would refuse to serve the com-
Dlainant until such time as the mine
owners treated their employes with
fairness. Meehan further deposed that
at that juncture one of the strikers
"suggested to Wilson that inasmuch
as he had been opposed to his fellow
workmen he could the better show his
sincerity by washing himself clean of
all his past acts by walking Into the
adjoining pond of water, which Wilson
thereupon did, without any force be
ing used or threat being made."
Judge Morrow smiled when this affi
davit was read and took the caae un
der advisement.

The most loathsome and repulsive of all \fegt^Jy
living things is the serpent, an*d the vilest and
most degrading of all human diseases is Contagious Blood Poison. The
serpent sinks its faegs mtothe flesh and almost instantly the poison passes
through the entire body. Contagious Blood Poison, beginningwith a little
ulcer, soon contaminates every drop of blood and spreads throughout the
whole systern. Painful swellings appear in the groins, a red rash and
copper colored splotches break out on the body, the mouth and throat
become ulcerated and the hair and eye brows fall out ; but these symptoms
are mild compared to the wretchedness and suffering that come in the latter
stages of the disease when it attacks the bones and more vital parts of the
body. It is then that Contagious Blood Poison is seen in all its hideous-

brought to the attention of the Com

several days ago to report to Chief

they will be heard at the meeting of
the board to-night.
Sheehan was retired by the pension

' urday were Emil Gebaner and Albert

â¢ siege of toil in the mines at Koswick.
, Their wardrobes were stored in two
j wicker telescope grips, which they left
under one of the seats on the lower
deck of the ferry-boat while they went
forward to study the formation of Tele
! graph Hill from a marine viewpoint.
When the boat bumped into the slip

Joseph Meyer went into a Chinese
restaurant on Clay street Saturday
night and ordered a repast. It con
sisted of chicken, . duck, $12 worth of
ham and eggs, frijoles and three pieces
of hot mince pie. The magnificence of
the order caused the chink to conclude
that at last he was famous and he
saw golden streams and fashionable
people pouring into his narrow eating
house.
After Meyer had dined he sat back
and rolled a cigarette. He had dined
and was impervious to fate. When
he arose to eo the Chinaman gently
questioned him about compensation.
For reDly Meyer pushed the muzzle of
a revolver in front of. the Chinaman's
nose at such an angle that the slant
ing eyes of the Oriental almost became
perpendicular in trying to realize the
awful possibilities of eternity contained
in that narrow barrel.
But when Meyer had departed, leav
ing the score unpaid: the Chinaman
blew a police whistle and secured the
aid of a policeman to whom alt guns
looked alike. The accused man was
before Judge Conlan yesterday and was
fined ?50, which it is understood he will
pay.
.Judge Conlan tame to the same de
cision and the little chaps will have to
learn from Judge Murasky the full
enormity of the offense of staying up
late. There have also been Instruc
tions from the Juevnile Court that the
police are to arrest any children, of
school age who are engaged in selling
papers or other commodities on the
streets during the hours when they
should be in school. Beware, children!
â¢The bogie man'll git you ef you don't
watch out."
Under instructions from Superior
Judge Murasky the police are taking
into custody all of the little boys who
vend sum "and other merchandise on
the streets after S o'clock, thus violat
ing the curfew ordinance. Judge Mo
gan had twelve of the kids before him
yesterday and Judge Conlan dealt with
â¢eight of the cases. '"Curfew must not
ring to-day," said Judge Mogan. as he
eyed the gran? of unwashed Italian
kid?. "I think this is a matter for
the Juvenile Court."
"I find that you are a traveler in
three distinct senses. You were com
ing from Tonopah; you intended to re
turn to Tonopah on the first train and
at the time of your forcible flight down
the basement stairs where you were
arrested you were certainly going some.
Defendant is discharged."
Judge Cabaniss, â¢ always a Daniel
come to judgment, found plenty of ex
cuses for Charles Johnson, a Tonopah
miner, who appeared before him yes
terday on a. charge of carrying con
cealed weapons. Johnson averred, a art
his demeanor spoke truth, that he had
come on a hurried business trip from
the desert mining camp, where a heavy
gun is as much of a garment as a pair
of socks. He intended to catch the next
train to the waterless, gold-banded bar
rens of the Sagebrush State, but chance
acquaintances caused him to overlook
the time limit.
When he sought the tram It had gone
and would not come back for him. So
he made one glad night of. it in the
city. During his wanderings he met
some kings of evil with whom he be
came embroiled. They rudely threw
him into a rathskeller at Geary and
Market streets and his trusty revolver
popped from its hidden depths. A po
liceman came along and arrested John
son for carrying concealed weapons.
Judge Cabaniss charged him in the fol

Coroner Leland held an inquest yes
terday morning on the body of Giu
seppi Martini, a divekeeper ..t S23 Pa
ci.lc street, who was shot and killed on
January 6 by Edward Richards. The
jury returned a verdict of justifiable
homicide.
The evidence was to the effect that
Richards and a depraved female
habitue of the dive were drinktns lager
beer together, a bottle being: ordered at
a time, the charge for each bottle being
GO cents as against the regulation price
of 10 cents in the groceries.
A dispute arcse between Richard3
and Martini respecting the payment for
one bottle of beer. Richard3 claiming
that he had already paid 50 cents for
it and Martini insisting that he had
not paid anything. Finally Richards
declared that he did not purpose to
pay again and that he was being im
posed upon. Martini thereupon resort
ed to the usual argument of the dive
keepersâa police clubâ and was ad
vancing toward Richards with the
weapon raised. Richards warned him
to keep back, and Martini continuing
to advance after the second warning.
Richards fired. iF- f -',s .;Â¦-?Â¦
' In rendering their verdict the jurors
said: 'â¢We believe from the testimony
in the case that the said Edward Rich
ards feared great bodily injury and
fired the sliot in self-defense: and we
furthermore believe it to be a case of
justiflable homicide."
Richards* preliminary examination
began before Police Judge Mogan yes
terday. Two witnesses were examined.
One of them v.as the girl who was
with Richards at the time of the
shooting. She srfid there were no
words and no quarrel previous to the
killing. She said she w^s sitting at a
table with Richards in the dance hall
when she 'heard a shot and saw Mar

Japanese Seeks l>aniasrc~.
H. Dochi, a Japanese, brought -suit
in Justice of the Peace Daniels* court
yesterday ajcainst Charles Mahoney to
recover 5299 damages. Dochi alleges
that Mahoney pushed him off an Â£llfs
street car on the morningr of January
26, 1903. and that he sustained in
juries that prevented him from work
ing for many months. The Judge took
the case under advisement.
urged the Finance Committee to make
arrangements for- an exhibit in the
Model City. Phelan announced that
an endeavor would be made to raise
535,000 additional by popular sub
scription in order that the amount for
a creditable exhibit will aggregate
550,000. ;
Xegro Agor.tino has an equity in
one of the most wonderful timepieces
that ever came from the hands of a
watchmaker. For its rarity he values
it highly and rightly enough. If
watches were sold by the pound It
would be worth nearly a million dol
lars. Compared to it the ferry clock
looks like a finger ring timepiece.
Agontino found himself Saturday
night with his precious watch and a
hold-over thirst that needed quench
ing. With considerable exertion he
packed his jag and the watch to a
pawnbroker named Crockett on Clay
street, who advanced $3 on the unique
indicator, but refused to lend on the
jag. The next morning Agontino
awoke without his cherished posses
sion and obtained a search warrant
against the pawnbroker.
The case was before Judge Conlan
yesterday. The pawnbroker and his
assistant took the disputed watch to
court. Luckily the courtroom was not
crowded, otherwise the exhibit would
have been deposited in Portsmouth
square for inspection. Agostino could
speak no English and told his story
through an Italian interpreter. He
said the watch had been stolen from
him while he was drinking.
"What!" said Judge Conlan. "Steal
a watch like that from a man? Why,
it would be easier to steal a truck
load of sewer pipe out of his inside
pocket. If this man carried this
watch and it was taken from him sud
denly he would have gone up in the
air 300 feet and floated around in
definitely."
The pawnbroker testified that Agos
tino had personally received $3 and
given his unique timepiece as a pledge.
The Judge told the complaining wit
ness that he would have to pungle up
the $3 if he wished ever to connect
himself with his ponderous watch
again, and dismissed the case.

Conroy, who was next in line. Deftly
he annexed the glittering coin and or
dered a seat in the train, as far as
Baden. Behind Conroy was Mrs. G. E.
Hamill of this city, who saw Conroys
peculation. When she learned that the
old man was searching for his missing
money she told him who the thief was
and a policeman did the rest.
Patrick Conroy --as convicted of
pÂ»tty larceny in Judge Fritz's court
yesterday and will be given a sentence
to-day. He grew industrious at the win
dow of the Southern Pacific depot at
Third and Townsend streets Sunday
and attached himself to a five-dollar
gold piece to which he could lay no
legal claim. An elderly man named
William Jones bought a ticket to San
Jose and tendered in payment a ten
dollar piece. The clerk gave him the
ticket and the change.
A committee consisting of E. B.
Pond, F. J. Symmes and J. D. Phelan
The San Francisco committee mem
bers were disappointed at the refusal
of the Commissioners to promise to
pay for erecting the San Francisco
building at St. Louis at the estimated
cost of $12,000, and did not hesitate to
say so after the conference was ended.
As neither the executive committee nor
the display committee for the city was
fully represented no action could be
taken. A report will be made back as
to the lack of success. The expecta
tion of the San Francisco committee is
that the show to be made by this city
will cost about $50,000 to collect, install
and maintain during the continuance
of the St. Louis exposition.
While the St. Louis Commissioners
yesterday declined to guarantee $12,000
to defray the cost of the San Fran
cisco bulldlne, it was agreed to pay
the transportation charges on all that
San Francisco wishes to send on as
exhibits. As the San Francisco display
will consist principally of maps, pic
tures and other articles that have little
weight, the transportation item will not
be. relatively, very large.
The Board of Supervisors yesterday
adopted a resolution authorising an
appropriation of $5000 out of the ur
gent necessity fund, if it contains that
amount on June 30, 1904, and pledg
ing the board to appropriate an addi
tional 510,000 for the purpose of de
fraying a portion of the expense of a
municipal exhibit at the St. Louis ex
position.
It was also pointed out by the mem
bers of the San FVancisco committee
in conference that unless San Fran
cisco has its own building at the great
show it will not be distinctively rep
resented, while many counties will be
on exhibition in the agriculture build
ing:.
The conference did not last long. The
St. Louis Cemmisaioners said that it
would be impossible to appropriate
512,000 as asked for the reason that
the entire appropriation has been prac
tically apportioned and there are un
avoidable expenses that will be very
large. For instance, the railroads are
going to charge a rate of 60 cents per
100 pounds for moving exhibits from
San Francisco to St. Louis. This rate
is for goods moved in one direction.
Those which are to be brought back to
California will trke a higher rate.
There are tons of mineral exhibits to
be moved to the mines and mining
building. There are many tons of fruits
In glass, vegetables, educational exhib
its and various bulky products which
at the transportation one-way rate of
60 cents per 100 pounds will make away
with the funds very fast.
COMMITTEE DISAPPOINTED.
REFUSE APPROPRIATION.
The Commissioners to the St. Louis
exposition were asked yesterday by the
executive committee and members of
the display committee for the city and
county of San Francisco to appropriate
$12,000 to pay for the erection of a mu
nicipal building at St. Louis to house
the exhibits this city will send on to
the great show and declined to make
the grant. . Ex-Mayor Phelan. Presi
dent Symmes of the Merchants' Asso
ciation, President E. B. Pond of the
San Francisco Savings Union and Mr.
Colburn, secretary of the San Fran
cisco committee, waited en the St.
Louis Commissioners at the Russ
Houie. Commissioners Filcher and
"Wiggins were in the headausirters of
the commission when the delegation
from San Francisco called.
Within a very few minutes a confer
ence took place. The representation
was made in behalf of San Francisco
that this city pays about one-third of
ail the taxes paid in this State. The
State % appropriated $150,000 for St.
Louis. On that basis, so said the mem
bers of the committee. $12 COO was not
a large sum to be appropriated to
have San Francisco provided with an
appropriate building among the other
municipal structures to be reared at
St. Leais.
All through, the hearin? the defend
ant, gowned modestly in brack, sat
rmiling at the discomfiture of Lay
mance and showing no traces of anx
ierY on her own account.
At 4:20 o'clock the hearing was ad
jcurne<l until Wednesday morning,
when Laymance will be further cross
examined and the prosecution expects
to present more testimony of bank offi
cials to the effect that they do not be
lieve the signature to be -genuine.
Jam*! H. Swift. pr^Fident of the
Columbian Banking Company, was a
witness for the prosecution as a hand
writir:? expert. He told the court that
fce bas^d his conclusion that the dis
puted checks vrere suprious on the fact
that they were not written on forms
ordinarily used by Laymance and in
the demeanor of the defendant when
the was accused by the bank officials
of presenting a forced cneck. During
th* cross-examination it was strongly
hinted by counsel for the defense that
Mr. Swift, who is the actual complain
ing witness, and the institution which
he represents would be made defend
ants in a heavy damage suit.
BA.VKKR TESTIFIKS.
l"ndf r tfce law? of evidence Judge |
Cabaniss was powerless to prevent the \
revelation of the relations which Lay- j
nance is alleged to have borne to the i
v.oraan whom he now accuses of forg
ing h:s name to a check. It was not a ;
particularly peasant story to listen to,
despite the repeated assertions of Lay
mance that for the twelve years of !
th^ir acquaintance there was nothing
meretricious in their association. From
the Questions asked on cross-examina
tion it was evident that the defense was
loaded to the muzzle with testimony,
rot only to refute the charge of for
rÂ«T- but further to prosecute the case
In civil and possibly criminal proceed-
i n c c
Judge Cabaniss clearly intimated his
opinion cf the merits of the case during
the grilling of Laymance by stating in
rlain language that he believed the al
legred spurious check to have been writ
ten by the same hand that penned ad
mittedly genuine exemplars of the
fame character? introduced as evi
dence. He did this for the # purpose of
to spare the witness the
frtur* 1 of a castigating cross-question
ing. The prosecution's counsel failed
to grasp the situation and allowed his
client v to suffer the ordeal.
Among the witnesses introduced by
the prosecution was Daniel E. Ames.
one of the old school of handwriting ex
perts. During his examination Judjre
Cabaniss picked up two checks, both
claimed to be forged, one for $50 and
one for HO.
"Show me the essential differences
between these two checks." said the
Judgw. The expert went into a long
discourse on up-Â«rrok~s. slants, shading
and other technical terms. Finally he
specified one check as genuine and the
uther as a forgery. As both of the
checks were claimed to be forgeries
his further testimony fell on unheeding
â¢ars.

Yon Wsnt Your Wsnts To be Known lo nos& Who W3nc o l\now
A sleight-of-hand man oft brings strange things 'to pass.
Such as birds from a hat, many drinks from one glass.
But Want Ads in The Call do wonders indeed
In all sort? of linos â to this statement give heed,
.And if there should ever occasion arise
To make use of their help it will cause you surprise
To see the results, for a few cents thus spent Â«

The Umatilla â¢ carried ' eighty, cabin

The Urnatilla. Captain Nopander,
probably had the hardest" tjme. She
reached port twenty-four hours late,
the trip from Victoria occupying sev
enty hours. All hands .wevq/worn out
and Captain Nopander.. who Svas on the
bridge most of -the passage, is prob
ably still in the arms of .-Morpheus,
making, up fcr the sleep, he '.did -not get
durlrjs the run from Puget Sound. The
Umatilla -was slowed d^ovvn during the
worst of the weather, but even that
did not save her from the mountains
of water that hurled themselves against
her stout, nose; poured like "a millrace
along her upper deckhand' made a con
tinuous cascade over -the stern. The
doors and windows of several state
rooms were smashed in and^few parts
of the steamship escaped some measure
of the deluge. So fiercely did the wind
blow that walking on decli was impos
sible for a landsman, full ;of danger
â¢or a Durser or. a -freight -clerk and
quite an undertakincr.for a 1 full grown,
active mariner. , ; '. 'Â¦' \'P~*i ! l
The present climatic disturbance, tha
moisture of which is bringing joy to
the heart of the farmer r ancl other land

storm means mere hardships '-and in
creased danger and for .trie landlubber

Chicago Grain Market.
CHICAGO, Jan. 18. â War .news was not t
needed to make a firm market In wheat. Di
minishing euppiies were striking enough for I
that purpose. In addition, the ' big bull.oper-;
ator was an active buyer throughout the se&- ;
slon. May opened %@*%c lower to a shade ,
higher at 8S%eSS9ic, and after touching 8STic !
the -price receded to 88%c. Buying by brokers ;
supposed to be for the account of the big long [
was the means of checking the early declining I
1 tendency. Local traders were disposed to sell, I
but the demand from the prominent holder dis- >
couraged euch action. Later in the day a
buying movement developed on world's ship
ments, a decreased amount on passage and the
flour situation in the Northwest. The leader of
the longs was an open buyer during the last
hour and the market became strong. May ad
vanced to W.Â«c but lost part of the gain on
profit taking. The close was strong, with May
at Â£S%c.
There was a strong tone In the corn market
and higher prices were realized. May ranged 1
between 4S T Â»c and 40%c and closed at 49V4Q>
49%c. ' ' . ' '
Oats were firm except for a brief period of 1
business in sympathy with the leading grains J
early In the day. May sold between 41c and !
42c. closing at 41%c.
Provisions suffered a little early weakness on !
receipts of hogs, but later the market became [
firm in sympathy with the strength in grains. ;
Closing prices Ehowed slight gains. May pork j
closed 2^c higher. May lard was up 12>4$J15c i
and ribs were 24c higher.. . 1

Inai. Dressed ' Turkeys were dull at nominal

Butter, Cheese and Eggs.
The Cheese market Is in a bad way. Every
dealer is loaded to the guards and nobobdy is
able to find an outlet for it. The recent high
prices led many Butter makers to abandon
Butter for Cheese, and the result la an over
stocked and unmanageable market. Oregon and
Washington nre also loaded down and arc ship
ping large lines into this market. So great
has this influx from the north become that
San Francieco dealers have lately notified
their northern correspondents not to send any 1
more Cheese here, even on consignment, but I
they are chipping Just the tame. Prices con
tinue to decline.
Eutter Is bnrely steady at the recent advance, j
Stocks* arc still li$ht. but as dealers generally
believe that the top has, been reached buyers
are not purchasing except to supply their dally
wants and the market is therefore quiet. Prices
are unchanged. j
Eggs continue weak, with a further shading I
of the Inside quotations. .. Receipts continue ;
heavy and stocks Bhow an increase every day. t
Dealers are making free concessions to buyers
to work off their stocks. The demand lg slow.

Deciduous and Citrus Fruit*.
Local trade in Citrus fruits was quiet, as j
the cold weather continued to discourage buy- j
ers. who were taking no more than absolutely I
necessary for .immediate requirements. There Â¦
was a good demand for fancy Navel Oranges j
for shipment to Honolulu on the steamer So- Â¦
I noma. which sails on Thursday, and large
sizes sold readily for that purpose both in the
' open market and at the auction rooms, where
the aggregate offerings were liberal. Ten cars.

situation as before stated. A New York dis
patch to Chicago said: "We understand that |
tremendous purchases of food products are be- j

statement of a high Japanese official that the <
Japanese did not want any American products ',

dently for a speculative campaign, the com
mon being lifted 1% and the preferred 3J^.
The bonds of the Rock Island group- of com
panies made even more sensational advances,
the fives scoring an upward bound of- 4*4 and
the fours 3 points. These advances were made
in a spasmodic manner on comparaitvely
cir.Â£!l dealings. The 5s Jumped \Vi points on
a fir.gie gale in the course of the advance.
The industrial department of the market was
rather broader, but was considerably over
shadowed by the hÂ«avy dealings in United
States Steel preferred. Rather vague . as
sertions of improving trade conditions accom
panied the buying. The enormous absorption
of the corporation's eecond mortgage 5 per
cent bond* had a marked sympathetic effect on
the preferred stock. The par value of th*
day's sales of the United States. Steel second
5s exceeded that of all the rest of the bonds
Bold during the day. This- .movement- was
induced bv the .announcement that the bonds
had been lined on the London . Stock Ex
change. This (?ave rise to aa expectation that
a comprehensive movement to make ' a mar
ket for the bonds was Jn -contemplation. A
similar expectation was an important ele
ment in the Rock Island movement. Amalga
mated Copper rose a point. The few rail
roads reporting gross earnings â¢ for the- sec
ond week in January made a more favorable
comparison with last year's i-orresponding pe
riods than was the case with 'the flret week's
earnings. The Missouri- Paerflc~,etatement of
net earnings for November showed- & decline
in net earnlnrs of .Â¦$438.951. .; -Money ..was .of
fered with rreat freedom and the rise â¢ ot
steriing exchange toward the gold export -point,
was not the cause of any surprise or apparent
uneasiness. ,Â¦ . . *â¢

In the title part Miss Adele Block's
vivacity was artistically modulated,
and she only displayed overexuberance
when she could not very well exercise
repression and make her idea Intelligi
ble. Miss Adele. Belgarde was appro
priately statuesque as a brummagem
Knickerbocker dame, and Miss Fran
ces Starr has seldom had better oppor
tunity to show her Ingenue piquancy
than she Is afforded in the role tT Cher
ry Perry, soubrette. Miss Marie Howe,
never a misfit, played the Irish < aunt
charmingly. The men moved through
the piece nicely, and for a first produc
tion the hitches were notably few and
ingeniously repaired. Indeed, in the
h/incls of a company less In harmony
and equipped with less readiness of re
source, "Mrs. Jack" would 'ave re
flected even less luster upon the lady
who constructed it.
Hilarity ran riot last evening .in the
audience compartment of the Alcazar
while the first act of "Mrs. Jack'' was
In progress, but after that there was
gradual subsidence of the mirth until
the outbursts became Infrequent and
weak of volume. It was no fault of the
players that the fun failed of suste
nance, for no coterie of stagefolk ever
worked with more intelligence or con
scientious endeavor to make the most
of the material' assigned them. They
were in nowise responsible for the
structural defects of the play.
"Mrs. Jack" was written by Grace
Livingston Furniss, and is classified as
"a farcical comedy In three acts." The
first act Is chockful of smart dialogue
that compensates to some extent for
inadequate action and the farcical ele
ment is well sustained. But Grace Liv
ingston Furniss. evidently exhausted
her grabbag of epigrams on the first
chapter, for the lines of the two suc
ceeding ones are "largely reiterative and
much given to unnecessary interchange
of reminiscence. And the climax of act
2 Is a bit of melodrama â masked bur
glars, revolvers and impossible heroics
â so pronounced that the gallery at the
Central would demand a dozen repeti
tions of it. Act 3 is mostly composed
of platitudes clothed In slang. Some
body Is "up against It" or else it Is "up
to" somebody. After the Initial act the
piece Is chiefly remarkable for Its In
consistencies.
The police think that , the letters ' and
papers that Soeder was so anxious to
secure referred to the conspiracy to
murder a victim for gain. . Â¦
Soeder went so far as to offer Frank
Cannon, a man convicted' of". burglary,
the sum of $300 to burn down: the horne
of Miss Flatley in order that the in
criminating letters and papers might be
destroyed. . : â¢;
Bowie hasalso informed; the police
that when he met Soeder the latter was
in possession of a gold- watch set with
a diamond and also, wore 'at diamond
ring. Soeder Informed him that he had
just returned- from Germany and that
he had come' Into a large inheritance.
Soeder displayed a receipt from a jew
eler's on Third : street, where he^ stated
he had bought the watch and ring.
James Bowie, a cook, residing at 749
Harrison street, has informed Detective
Gibson that he had known Soeder for
seven years. Three weeks ago Bowie
met Soeder and Blaise on Third street.
Soeder took Bowie, Into < a -saloon and
made a proposition to him to steal his
trunk from the house of Miss/Catherine
Flatley. 300 Marshall street, and prom
ised him J40 / for the work. Shortly
afterward Soeder met a cook who in a
friend of Bowie and promised him $20
to assist Bowie In stealing the trunk.
Bowie and his friend decided to have
nothing to do/ with , Soeder, knowing
that he was anex-convlct and-.feared
ho was leading them into a trap. "
Soeder's. reason for asking the two
men. to secure his. trunk was that lie
desired to secure some letters and pa
pers which he did not desire Miss Flat
ley to see. ' .Â¦ " â¢ â¢
DESIRED HIS TRUNK STOLEN.
That Soeder was prepared to enter
into desperate criminal acts Is still fur
ther proven by evidence secured yes
terday. . ...
The woman's evidence is of the
greatest value, for it discredits Soe
der's former statement that he was In
his room all last Sunday . evening,
when Blaise met his death. The po
lice have the .woman under surveil
lance.
All persons interviewed by. the police
have been warned to say nothing con
cerning the case to any one except the
detectives detailed to secure informa
tion, while some persons have been
threatened with arrest. The reason for
the secrecy maintained by the police is
that they deshre to secure sufficient evi
dence to warrant the arreat of otner
pet sens. They are perfectly .satisfied
that they now have sufficient evidence
to warrant the conviction of Soeder on
a charge of murder.
Up to two days ago the police, lacked
the evidence of some person to disprove
the alibi of Soeder that he spent the
evening of the murder in ' his room.
The police now ha've a witness to prove
that Soeder was seen in &; saloon on
Pacific street drinking with a- woman
on the Sunday night that Blaise was
murdered. The time that Soeder was
seen in the saloon was two hours after
the hour that Blaise was murdered, the
time of death being fixed at between 9
and 9:30 p. m. by medical testimony.
Detective Thomas Gibson has found
a woman named Teresa, an habitue of
the O. K. saloon dance hall, 517 Pa
cific street, who drank with Leon:Soe
der on Sunday night, two hours after
Blaise was murdered on Russian Hill..
The girl told Gibson and John
Grasso, proprietor of the saloon, that
she is positive that the man was Soe
der, because he had been there on
several occasions before, and once
while there he had his brother-in-law
Blaise with him.
It is known, positively that Chief of
Police Wittman has telegrams in his
possession, sent from New York and
Europe, proving that others were asso
ciated with Soeder in the conspiracy
that led to murder.
WARNED TO KEEP SILENT.
Eight hoursh were lost to the police
by the actions of Captain Martin on
the day the murder was reported. When
the information was sent to police
headquarters that Blaise had been
found dead with his, throat cut, Mar
tin visited the scene of the crime and
then declared that the case was one of
accident. Then he changed his mind
and declared it was suicide, and it was
not until the insurance men appeared
at police headquarters that Martin ad
mitted that the case was one of mur
der. Â¦ * Â¦ :
In the meantime Soeder was allowed
to roam around the city, take his
clothes to a cleaning works? pawn his
revolver and make away with any
evidence that might have had a direct
bearing on the murder of Blaise.
All the evidence in the possession of
the police has been secured by the work
of Detective Tom Gibson. Gibson was
not put on the case until Soeder had
had every opportuni*" to cover up, his
tracks and destroy important evidence.
While Gibson will not talk and his
superiors refuse to give out any In
formation, it is known that the police
are working on the. lines that a con
spiracy existed that led to the murder
of Blaise for the purpose of securing
money on insurance policies on -the life
of the dead man.
TIME LOST BY THE POLICE.
As in the first stages of the rfurrant
and Botkin murder cases, the police
are either denying the truth of or con
fessing'absolute ignorance as to the
news published concerning evidence
discovered by them.
According to Captain of Detectives
Martin he has accomplished nothing in
the case, liver since the discovery of
the murder of Blaise, Captain Martin
has had but one answer to all ques
tionsâ"There is nothing new."
The Police Department li using every
means at its disposal to keep secret all
the Information secured against Leon
Soeder, who stands charged with the
murder of his brother-in-law^ Joseph
Blaise. The explosive publication in
The Call yesterday that the police were
actively engaged in searching for evi
dence to warrant the arrest of at least
three accomplices of .Soeder created
considerable, comment in police circles.
Work on this line is still being dili
gently carried on..
It waB given out in Sacramento last
evening that Governor Pardee has de
cided to confer on Major John B.
Laack, traveling passenger agent of
the Southern Pacific Company, and one
of the best known Grand Army men in
this State, the position of adjutant
general of Califrvrr.ia. now held by
Hrlgadier General George Stone. Ear
lier in the day it was learned at the
railroad office that Major Lauck had
handed in his resignation to take ef
fect o:i the last day of the present
month and this bit of news, which was
b^inpr carefully fruarded. was promptly
accepted as confirmatory of the infor
mation received from Sacramento.
Major Lauck has been connected with
thÂ«- Southern Pacific Company's pas
Â«.-<-np*M- department f<>r many years and
i?' regarded as a valuable employe by
the officials of that road. He has also
been active in Grand Army circles and
the State Guard for years and served
f<">r a long time as commander of one
nf the companies of the Fifth Infantry*
Regiment in Oakland, of which Gov
ernor Parde^ was once also a member.
He Is considered a very capable man
for the position of adjutant general and
it is no doubt this fact that commend
ed him to Governor Pardee.
Simultaneous with the announcement
of Major Lauck's proposed retirement
from the railroad service another was
made that Floyd S. Judah. at present
a clerk in the informaUon bureau, is to
cucceod Lauck as traveling passenger
agent. Young Judah is the son of H.
R. Judah. assistant general passenger
agent of the Southern Pacific Company,
and has received much of his railroad
education under the watchful eye of
his expprieneed and popular parent.
"When "William McMurray recently re
signed the position of chief of the in
formation bureau it was expected that
Judali would bo his successor, but in
the light of yesterday's events it ap
pears that the head of the passenger
traffic department of the road had an
other and equally as good position in
store for the young man.
At present harmony reigns in the
Republican camp of the Second Dis
trict. As no election for Governor Is
pending" there are no indications that
disturbing elements will be thrown into
the Congressional contest. It is re
ported that Assistant United States
Attorney D. E. McKinlay of Sonoma is
willing to accept the Republican nomi
nation'for Congress in this ' district.
Efforts are being put forward to induce
Judge John A. Barham of Santa Rosa,
who represented the old .First District
In- Congress for several terms, to re
enter the political arena.. "Word comes
from Yuba County that Colonel E. A.
Forbes may be chosen to carry the
party's standard in the cominsf Con
gressional battle. Frank L. Coombs is
practicing law in' Napa. Many- of his
old-time adherents advise him to ask
for the nomination. It Is predicted that
he would defeat his former antagonist.
Theodore A. Bell. It Is said . that Mr.
Coombs will await thÂ« turn of events.
Republicans who are familiar with ex
istinsr conditions in the district are con
fident that the Democrats cannot hold
the advantage gained two years ago.
It is admitted that Mr. Bell is perr
sonally popular and also energetic, but
the party he represents cannot win
against united Republicans.
At the general election in November,
1902, Frank L. Coombs, the Republican
nominee, received 21.181 votes. Theo
dore A. Bell received 21.536. Sacra
mento County, much to the surprise of
the Republicans, gave the Democratic
candidate- for Congress a -small major
ity. -The clashing of the Flint and
Gage forces for control of certain dele
gations-to the Republican State con
vention caused a bitter flpht against
Mr. Coombs. The fight did not end
with the adjournment of the State con
vention, but was prolonged until the
day 6f election. Ties of personal friend
ship and fraternal association impelled
the Republican nominee for -Congress
to express sympathy with Mr. Flint's
aspiration for, gubernatorial honors.
Leaders of the anti-Flint faction retal
iated by knifing Coombs at the general
election. â¢.
The election next November of a
solid Republican Congressional delega
tion I from California would not create
much surprise In the political camps.
The preliminaries for the contest in the
Second. District are now under consid
eration. The counties of Mendocino,
Glenn. . Col usa, Butte. Sutter. -Yuba,
Sacramento, Yolo, Lake. Napa. Sonoma
and Marin comprise this district, which
is now represented in Congress by The
odore A. Bell of Napa. It is common
gossip that the Republicans, under
fairly acceptable leadership, .can regain
the lost ground next November. It is
regarded as settled that Mr. Bell will
be renominated by the Democrats.
Luporini did lot see the men until
they had pounced upon him. He start
ed to resist, and was promtply. rapped
on the head with the butt of a revolver.
The baker was momentarily stunned by
the- blow, but was conscious enough to
know that one. of the thugs still had
him covered, while the other was going
through his pockets. ' .â¢
Taking the $130, r.ll the money the un
fortunate man had in his possession,
Â¦the two robbers started to run down
Broadway to the water front" Luporini
had a police whistle, and as soon as the
thieves started lo run he blew it vig
orously.
Officers Silver and Minahan, who
happened to be in the neighborhood,
heard the whistle and chdsed the flee
ing robbers down Broi dway. They
were joined by several oedestrians and
pursued the thugs to a point near the
water front, where they- escaped among
the numerous freigl.t cars that line the,
streets at that place.
The pursuit was very exciting for the
time that it lasted. The. police * are
still working on the case and hope to
apprehend 'the criminals before long.
Â¦'Antone Luporini, an Italian baker,
was held up an robbed of $130 early
Monday moTning. ; Luporini was walk
ing up Broadway, near Montgomery
avenue, when two men wearing black
masks jumped^out. f rom ; a dark door
way and, thrusting- revolvers' into the
Italian's face;; commanded him to turn
over his cash.
Practically if not all the troops going
to and coming from the Philippines
pass through here, and the post should
from its standpoint of importance be
placed second to none in this coun
try. All had calculated that the visit
of the Secretary would bring about the
desired results.
General MacArthur has decided to
postpone the crand review of all the
troops announced for Wednesday morn
ing until a later date.
No post in the United States is so
prominent before the nation to-day
from a military standpoint as the Pre
sidio, and no post has received so little
attention and so little consideration
from the Government. No post in the
Unien can to-day boast of so many
troops quartered within its environ
ments, and no post is so inadequately
fitted for the housing of these troops.
It is true that during the last six
rtvmths improvements to the extent of
possibly J250.000 have been made. These,
however, were actual necessities.
NEEDS OF THE PRESIDIO.
It was the original intention to land
the Secretary at Oakland mole, but the
Slocum is too deep draught to land
there, so the ferry slip will be the ob
jective point.
Why the new Secretary is to be hur
ried through in such great haste may
lead to many conjectures. Perhaps the
sounds of war., in Japan and at the
isthmus of Panama may have had
something to do with the Secretary's
movements, and this is the only pos
sible apology that can be offered to
San Francisco for his not remaining
here long enough to inspect so impor
tant a post as the Presidio and to give
him an insight into the harbor, its de
fenses and its needs.
The Slocum will then proceed imme
diately to the ferry slip at the foot of
Market street, where the Secretary will
board the ferry leaving at 10 a. m. to
connect with the through train to the
East.
According to the present arrange
ments the reception to the new Secre
tary will tak* place immediately after
the steamer Korea passes through the
Golden Gate. That is. the formal
greeting from the representatives of
the Government will be extended to the
distinguished official by Colonel George
Andrews, adjutant general o* the Di
vision of the Pacific, who goes as rep
resentative of weneral MacArthur. and
Major Parker W. West, aid to General
MacArthur.

The. announcement that ex-Governor

.give San Francisco the "go-by" and
proceed straight on to Washington is
the cause of great disappointment to
the citizens of San Francisco and also
to all the army officials here.
The plans for the grand review of
the troops at the Presidio and the en
