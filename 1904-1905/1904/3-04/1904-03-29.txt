. SEOUL, March 26 (via ' Shanghai,
March 28.)â Japan's main army- in
Korea, consisting of 90,000 men. has be
gun the advance in force toward the
Yalu. The advance guard has taken
up a position seventy-five miles north
west of Pingyang. The movement is
proceeding 1 cautiously, intrenchments
being erected at intervals along the
route to protect a retreat, should the
Russian forces triumph on the Yalu.
Cossacks are constantly harassing the
Japanese Infantry, the cavalry of the
Mikado's army- being unequal to the
task of protecting the infantry during
the advance. Skirmishes are frequent.
Contrary to previous reports, the
Russians evidently intend to make a
desperate stand south of the Yalu. In
fantry and artillery have crossed the
river and taken up strong positions
commanding the "Peking road," which
the Japanese are following.

and allowances of the Postofflce De
partment. The action takes effect Im
mediately. Rand was appointed in
April, 1902. During the postal inquiry
it was charged that he was Interested
in the promotion of numerous specu
lative enterprises, mostly mining com
panies, and that he used his influential
position to induce departmental em
ployes to Invest in his schemes. The
Bristow report failed to sustain the
charges, but Rand never appeared
again officially at the department, and
it was generally understood that he'
never would resume his official duties.

Senator Perkins argued that the ap

the bill by the House on allegations
that it was excessive, was little above
the rate on the Atlantic per pound of
mail carried. Senator Perkins said he
represented the commercial organiza
tions of San Francisco, which believed
that the Pacific Coast should not be
discriminated against in this matter.
,The charge was made that this is a
ship subsidy, bat, whatever name it

ST. LOUIS. March 2S.â Joseph Ralph
Burton, United States Senator from
Kansas, was convicted by a Jury In
the United States District Court to-day
on the charge of having accepted com
pensation to protect the Interests of
the Rialto Grain and Securities Com
pany of St. Louis before the Postofflce
Department. The jury deliberated
forty-eight hours.
A motion for a new trial was imme
diately' filed by the counsel for the
Senator. Judge Adams thereupon or
dered that Senator Burton appear in
court either in person or by proxy at
10 o'clock from day to day # untii the
court has heard the argument for a
new trial, and_if decided against him
to fix his punishmen.tr
Senator Burton went directly from
the courtroom to the Southern Hotel
after the verdict was rendered and re
tired to his room for rest. After a time
he went down to the hotel lobby and
sat around talking: with friends who
occasionally dropped in. Apparently he
was very nervous and his appearance
was -worn, the anxiety of the past week
having very perceptibly left its effect.
When asked if he had anything to say
concerning the verdict, he hesitated a
few minutes and then said:
"I refer all inquiry to my attorneys.
You certainly appreciate the situation
and understand that I have nothing to
say."
BURTON HEARS VERDICT.
At the time that word was received
by the court that the Jury had agreed
and was ready with a verdict Senator
Burton had gone to the Southern Ho
teL A marshal was sent to notify him
to appear in court. The Senator came
into the courtroom at ten minutes after
12 o'clock. He had been sent for a
half hour before and the long delay
caused a rumor that he had collapsed.
Few people were in the courtroom when
he entered. He took his seat by the
side of his attorney, Mr. Lehmann, and
looked the jurors in the face as they
entered.
There was no perceptible change in
Senator Burton's countenance when
the verdict was read. Judge Krum
asked to have the jury polled. Each
answered that the verdict was his
own. Judge Krum forthwith present
ed a motion for a new trial. The
court replied that the bond of $5000
was entirely sufficient.
If this verdict is sustained Senator
Burton will lose his seac in the Sen
ate and forever be prohibited from
holding any office of public trust.
Each count constitutes a separate of
fense and Senator Burton could re
ceive a pentitentiary sentence of two
years or a $10,000 fine on each
count. Senator Burton's conviction is
the first under this section of the stat
ute, which was enacted by Congress
in 1864. Â¦.'/,...
SENATORS ARE SILENT.
WASHINGTON. March 28. â Mem
bers of the Senate Committee on Priv
ileges and Elections have discussed the
conviction of Senator Burton, but be
fore the matter comes before the
committee" the members are loth to
give their personal views. It will take
a formal action by the Senate to de
cJare Burton's seat - vacant and this
will not be done unless a court? of last
resort has passed upon the case.
Reference to a compilation of Sen
ate election cases from 1789 to 1903
shows no expulsion of a Senator for
conviction of a crime, though there
have been instances where members of
the Senate have resigned before action
on charges. The first expulsion from
the Senate for any cause was that of
William Blount, who was a Senator
from. Tennessee from 1795 to 1799. A
special. Investigation committee found
him guilty of the authorship of a let
ter capable of various constructions,
but which in his own mind, according
to the letter, appeared to be "inconsist
ent with the interests of the United
Spates and Spain." He was found
guilty of high misdemeanor and a res
oiution of expulsion was adopted by
a vote of 23 to 1.
For complicity in the Burr conspiracy
an action was brought to expel John
Smith, a Senator from Ohio from Octo
ber 25. 1803. until he resigned, April 23,
1&03. Indictments had been found
against Senator Smith in the courts of
Virginia, but he was not convicted.
When the resolutions for expulsion
were presented to the Senate the vote,
after long debate, resulted 19 ayes and
10 noes. Two-thirds of the Senate not
concurring therein, he was not expelled,
but about two weeks later he resigned.
A number of Southern' Senators were
Â¦ WASHINGTON. March 2S.âRepre
sentative Champ Clark of Missouri to
day added a comprehensive chapter to
the campaign material of the Desro
.crati'c party in tjje delivery of a care
fully prepared speech on the tariff
question in the House. Clark said in
Â¦opening: Â¦
"We go- forth to battle with 'tariff
reduction and genuine reciprocity' in
scribed ui>on our banner."
â¢ He then drew a line of demarkaticn
between the tariff ideas of the two par
ties uid dwelt at length on the "stand
.pat" declaration of the Republicans.
â¢He called attention to the dissenting
element of that party, who, he said,
rr.sxehcd under the banner of the "IoT-a.
idse,'' and inferential ly iNi^classci this
element Â«.s Democrats.
"Republican harmony, which they
spell with a big. big H,* " said Clark,
":s cr.ly on the surface, while Repub
lican dissension pervades the grand old
party through and through. I"hey may
be able by hock and oy crook to get
together for this election, but that there
v.-i:i br a s'oughing off or the party
which will amount to a split in the
xear future is indicated by all the signs
of tfc & time.
"That Colonel Roosevelt will be nora
! :nated eppears to be certain, but
. hundreds of thousands of Republicans
Â¦will suprxTt him under protest. The
vtand patters' will make the platform,
but a targe majority will receive it
BSilenljr. In fact, the reading out pro
cess of the tariff reform Republicans
has already begun."
CRITICISM OP HEPBURN.
Clark referred to Representatives
Hepburn and Grosvenor as "luminaries
of the first magnitude in the Congres
sional galaxy and high priests in the
temple of protection." He took Hep
burn to task for saying in a speech
that the production of pig iron in this
country had only increased from 11.-
DMMNM tons ten >Â»ars ag(/ to 44,000,000
tons in VjO2. Clark declared that in
ISft2 the production in the United States
Â¦was Jf,821^0fl tons. He then quoted
Hpjtburhs statement in this same
epHeech: "I live in a county of 24.000
freeple â a farming community. There
i> Dot a protected industry in that coun
ty " a:..1 commented on it as follows:
"By that one deciaratir-n, unwittingly
utured. no doubt, the gentleman from
Iowa answers completely all the Re
publican speeches, editorials and essays
a= to how the high tariff helps the
farmers."
The reciprocity speech of Represen
tatfvt Diizell* delivered in the House
recently, was given considerable atten
tion ry Clark. The keynote of that
speech h(. declared to be this sentence,
"Republican reciprocity is reciprocity
in non-competing articles and nothing
else."
This doctrine, he said, differed very
widely from McKir.ley ' reciprocity, the
foundation principle of which was ex
pressed by President .McKialey at Buf
falo in tht-s.e words:
"We must not repose in fancied se
curity that we can forever sell every
thing ana buy little cr nothing."
DEMOCRATIC RECIPROCITY.
The Democratic position on reciproc
ity, Clark stated, had been set forth
by Mr. William?, the minority leader.
"It is," he caid. "an authoritative state
ment ta>on which we are willing to
FtandjJn th* rending campaign and here
after o It is that the Democratic party
believe^, that when on any articles that
go toc^uba or any other people on the
face of the earth you get an agreement
to i educe the burdens to their consum
ers by retracing the duties in their
markets- you have conferred a benefit
i:pOn th<e!r consumers ar.d also on the
American r>rcd'jcer, because you en
Â£b!e the consumer in Cuba or else

these- reciprocal relations to get the
product at a cheaper price. That en
able? tho*e who have been buying it to
buy more and enables those who have
hitherto not been able to buy any to
buy some, and that Increases the vol
ume of the consumption of American
products and benefits the American
producer by enabling him to sell more*
goods at the old profit, and thus both
parties to the trade are benefited."
The "stand pat" policy Clark attrib
uted to General Grosvenor. who. he
raid, was Interviewed shortly after the
election in Ohio in November, 1901,
and in exuberance of spirit said, re
garding the election: "It means 'that
there is no more prospect of the Ding
ley tariff rates being tinkered -with
than there is of. amending the Ten
Commandments."

LONDON, March '28. â A special dis
patch to the Chronicle from Rome
says: ;>. c
"For two days past the palaces and
gardens of. the Vatican have been
closely guarded by a large force of
Italian soldiers and police specially
drafted for the aurpose.
"Your correspondent tried to solve
the mystery and was assured to-night
by a Vatican ecclesiastic that the un
wonted guard was due to the discov
ery of a plot against the Pope's life."
The efforts to guard the Vatican
may be due to political affairs grow
ing out of the impending visit to Rome
of President Loubet of France. The
fact that : the soldiers are Italians
would seem to indicate that the Ro
man Government placed them there,
the Pope having his own soldiery and
having always refused to have any
intercourse with the Italian Govern
ment, calling himself "the prisoner of
Italy."
DENVER, March 28.â Five more ar
rests were made by the militia at Tel
luride to-day. A detachment of cav
alry went to Ophir, one of the min
ing camps of the district situated sev
eral miles from the town of Telluride,
and returned to the latter place with
the men arrested and placed them
in the military prison. The na
ture of the charges against the men
was not disclosed, but Adjutant Gen
eral Bell intimated that they were
grave. Two of the five men taken in
custody are business men of Ophir and
the rest are strikers.
Considerable excitement was caused
to-night- by the placing of a guard of
cavalry around the hotel at which At
torney Woods of Ouray, who repre
sents President Moyer of the Western
Federation of Miners, is stopping. This
was done by order of General Bell, who
learned that threats of lynching 1 had
been made against Woods. A news
paper owned by Woods, which is pub
lished in Ouray. recently criticized un
sparingly the Citizens* Alliance of Tel
luride for its alleged connection with
the deportation of union miners.
Almost from the moment of Woods'
arrival in Telluride. several days ago
in company with Moyer, he has been
insulted by different citizens of the
town. To-day an effort was made- ac
cording .to reDcrt, to engage him in a
quarrel. % ' He avoidedâ¢ a. * "> conflict by
passing into the hotel. Ab he did so
one the party threatened to "get him
to-night." This remark reached the
ears of General Bell, and he imme
diately ordered a detachment of troops
to guard the quarters of Woods and
sent him word that he could have all
the protection he needed.
"Mother" Jones, who was deported
ty the military from Trinidad, left
Denver to-day for Crested Butte and
will work among the miners of Gunni
son County, where martial law has not
been established. She said that the mi
litiamen did not give her time to get
her clothes before leaving Trinidad.
She has telegraphed President John
Mitchell of the United Mine Workers
of America concerning the treatment
she received and asked him to take the
matter before President Roosevelt. It
is said that Mr. Mitchell agreed to do
so. and that he has already started for
Washington for that purpose.-

Lennon of the Marin County Superior
Court has handed down a decision
affecting both employe and employer.
The decision was the outcome of a
suit of W. A. Sutcliffe' against George
E. Smith and D. C. Braid of Mill

and ! appeal taken to the Su

involved was the right of an

TRUCKEE, March 28.â Great damage
is being caused 40 numerous resorts
around the shores of Lake Tahoe. The
water is so high that the waves are
breaking up wharves and buildings and
the loss to proprietors will be enor
mous. The big wharf at Tahoe City
was demolished last week and the Ta
hc-e Navigation Company expects to
lose the long wharf on which the sup
ply of fuel and other, equipment are
stored. The water is up to the stringer
of the wharf now and is expected
go at least two feet higher by July.
The Tevis boathouse and various re
sorts at Tallac, McKinneys, Brockway
and Tahoe City have been damaged to
a greater or less extent during the last
few days. The water is now higher
than at any time since 1861, being with
in four inches of the top of the dam.
NAPA, March 2S.â A heavy rain fell
here Sunday and to-day. The creeks
are running full and the Napa River
has been out of its banks at China
town all . day. The prospects are for
a continued storm. The rainfall for
thirty hours preceding 1 o'clock this
afternoon amounted to 1.28 inches. Thi3
makes a total for the season to date
of 29.81 inches against 24.17 inches for
last season to corresponding date.
GRASS VALLEY, March 21â All rain
records for ten years have been broken
by the Reason's fall to date. Fifty
eight inches have fallen here up to
noon to-day and there is no sign of
cessation. It has rained here daily for
eight week*. As a result many cattle
have died from exposure and lack of
food, while nearly every mine in" the
district is flooded more or less. Some
of the biggest mines lost several levels
and the water Is still rising, despite
every effort to keep It down. In a few !
instances all hands have been laid off. |
This condition is unprecedented in the i
mining history of the county. :J

situation is unchanged here to-day.
The Sacramento River stands at 23^
feet, which Â¦ Is . five or six feet below
high water mark and about eight feet
below the danger line. No apprehen
sion is felt here as the waters from
the recent storm will have a vast area
to spread over in the overflows above
here and will not raise the river at
this point more than a few inches.
Work on the closing of the Edwards
break in the levee three miles south
of Sacramento was resumed to-day
and will be pressed with vigor. It
ought to be closed in ten days if the
weather conditions do not turn out
bad. There was a slight wash in the
levee 1000 feet above the Edwards
break this forenoon, but a pile driver
was sent to the spot and the danger
was guarded against by driving some
piles where needed.
SAN RAFAEL, March 28.â The
storm continues in various parts of
Marin Countv. In fact, out of ! the
twenty-eight days this month it has
rained twenty-seven of them and there
is no outlook of an immediate cessa
tion of the storm. The precipitation
during the last twenty-four hours has
been 3.08 inches and the total thus far
for the season is 47.13. It is still pour
ing and the prediction is that the 50
inch mark will be reached before morn
ing. Last season there was onlv 36.13
inches all told. At Mill Valley the pre
cipitation has not been so great as in
other portions of the county, but great
damage has been done. Ben Johnson,
who has resided here some thirtv odd
years, says he never saw the equal of

miles above Carters. Last week the
snow extended down almost to the val

The most of _the water from Tuolumne

Postmaster Nelson to-day received the

McAdie:
A telephone message from Linden this
afternoon stated that the highest water
of the year was expected there to

there last night and to-day and the
storm was heavier in the foothills.
It is from back water in the San
Joaquin that the greatest danger
comep, and even at dusk to-night Ihe
channels in the city had little or no
current toward the river. With water
coming down and unable to find an out
let the natural results will be that the
smaller streams will* leave their banks.
The water is not expected to-night and
perhaps not for twenty-four hours or
more, but It is felt that the crisis is at
hand.
STOCKTON, March 23. â The first
serious apprehension of a flood in and
about the city since the spring freshets

Calaveras River and Mormon Channel

Proctor presented a partial report
on the army appropriation bill. He said
that among the items disagreed to was
that Riving rank to retired offlcers -who
had served in the Civil War. He said
the House had accepted k.he Senate
provision for an increase of the En
gineer Corps of the army.
The report was accepted and a fur
ther conference ordered.
The pension question was laid aside,
and the District of Columbia appropri
ation bill was passed after a little dis
cussion of p.mendments.
"1 don't think the order extraoi
dir.ary," said Foraker, in conclusion.
"on the contrary, I consider it wist:
and prudfcnt, and I believe that the
Presidort. the Secretary of the In
lerior. the Commissioner of Pensions
and all who had anything to do witti
It are entitled to much credit."
Foraker said his understanding of
the order is that an ex-Bo!dfer does not
necessarily come into a pension at the
ace of 62, but the fact of age is only
an evidential fact, which shifts the
hurden of proof to the Government.
The effect was to give a man 62 years
old a prima-facie case before the de
partment.
KoraJcer defended the order as a
praiseworthy one in purpose, and
contended that the law givW the Pres
ident authority to make rules and reg
ulations for the enforcement of the
statute.
"But." he said, "that docs not help
the case. I admit that the first viola
tion of the law in this respect occurred
at that time. The order in that oase
was. however, comparatively reason
able, and the precedent has been vio
lently seized upon bj- the present oc
fflimnt of the White House to extend
the practice."
HcCumber, chairman of the Commit
tee on Pensions, said that the present
practice is to assume disability at the
age of 65. He contended that, accord
ing to the order, the fact that a man
has reached the age of 62 years Is
laker, only as prima-facie evidence of
disability.
McCumber contended that if an in
vestigation was to be made at all it
fchould be rr.ade lÂ»y the Commitioe on
Pensions, and n >t by the Committee on
Judiciary. ,

â¢.lie recent order of the Pension Bureau

cuÂ£Eion of the pension order was based
Â«-n the resolution'.offered some days ago
by Carmack directing the Committee
or. Judiciary to inquire into the au
thority <<f the executive branch of the
Croverunebt to make such an order.
Carmack contended that no such au
thority exists, but several Republican
Senators argued (hat the order was
in line with the regulation issued by
"Â«'udpe L/>chren. Commissioner of Pen
sions under Cleveland, fixing 6."> years
if age as an evidenc-e of infirmity.
They also declared that the new law
wr.'.ld have only the el'ect of afford
in? prima-taeic evidence of disability,
arid not that of giving a pension
solely because the age of 62 years
hed been reached by the pension ap
plicant.

suggestions from McCumber and Aid
rich, that the first step fixing old age
as an evidence of disability had been
tak*>n by Mr. Cleveland.
REDDING, March 28.â Four men and
a boy encamped two miles south j of

last night, in which Joseph Davis, a na

tion of 'miner, was killed, and James
Leahy, miner, aged 46 years, was
stabbed so severely that it is believed
this morning he will die. No one else
was hurt. Knives, pistols, clubs and
hatchets were used in the deadly. fray.
Davis was shot, cut and beaten. . His

one concerned in the trouble have been

SEATTLE, March 28.â Guard Cor
coran of the Folsom, Cal., State prison,
arrived in Seattle" last night and at
once went to the County Jail, where
he immediately identified A. L. Ray
mond, a man under arrest there, as E.
L. Eldridge, one of the prisoners who
escaped from the prison last July after
a desperate battle with the guards, in
which two of them were killed and a
half-dozen were badly Injured.
When Guard Corcoran was taken to
the jail five prisoners, among whom
was Eldridge, "were stood in line against
a wall. â¢ Corcoran 'stopped before them
and instantly pointed out Eldridge as
one -of the desperadoes who escaped.
"There's the man," said Corcoran, es
he talked over to Eldridge and placed
his hand on his shoulder. . "You're the
man who stabbed me as you escaped. I
know you.. You can't fool me."
Eldridge said nothing. He merely
smiled as the jailer led him back to his
cell.
Early this morning Corcoran went to

steamer Mermaid belongs at Nanaimo,
where her owner, Captain .Wardill,
and' his family reside. , She plied on
the Victoria-Nanaimo run in 1892 and
two years later was seized by the
Sheriff and sold to the New Victoria
Coal Company. The coal company used
her to convey miners to and from Pro
tection Island.' She struck on the rocks
near the entrance to the harbor two
years ago and was raised by Wardill,
who purchased her after refitting: and
put her on~ the Jervis and Vancouver
run.
VANCOUVER, B. C, March 23.â
The steamer Mermaid is 100 fathoms
deep in the bottom of Jervis Inlet, 100
miles up the coast. She sank on Fri

the rocks in broad daylight. The crew
and three passengers took to the ship's
boats and the Mermaid sank sho'rtly

LONDON, March 23.â As announced
in these dispatches yesterday, the As
sociated Press addressed a telegram to
Leopold, King of Belgium, saying that
it would j be happy to cable to the
United States any statement which his
Majesty might see fit to make in re
lation to the charges against the'Gov
ernment of the Congo Free State re
garding atrocities committed upon the
natives made to President Roosevelt'
and" Secretary of State Hay by a dele
gation from the missionary congress,
and in reply to which, his Majesty,
through his secretary, promised to mail
official documents from the Congo Free
State in which would be found all the
facts essential to a full and truthful
statement of the case.
These official documents were for
warded by King Leopold and were re
ceived to-night by the Associated Press.
They include papers Issued by the Gov
ernment since June, 1903, in which the
Congo Free State replies to the charge
of oppression and of cruelty toward the
natives, and to criticism of the eco
nomic regime and the charge of a vio
lation of the general act of the Berlin
conference.
A synopsis of the contents of these
papers has been published in a blue
book and elsewhere from time to time
as issued. They enter in the closest de
tails into the various charges, replying
to them in like detail and quoting at
length from the reports , resulting from
numerous investigations, especially
that of Roger Casement, the British
Consul in the ' Congo Free State, whose
report regarding mutilations and other
cruelties is* severely criticized. In these
documents it is asserted that Consul
Casement' gathered the details for his
report largely from unsupported native
statements, which afterward proved ut
terly untrue. * \- '
The documents forwarded to the As
sociated Press endeavor to demon
strate by careful data that there is
good reason to doubt the reliability of
these specific instances of cruelty and
oppression as given , by. Consul Case
ment and others, because of their de
pendence upon hearsay testimony. . At
the same time it Is pointed out that
these replies to the charges are only
a preliminary step, and that a close In
vestigation of the situation'; is still
proceeding under the orders of . the
King of Belgium.' and "that after ;this
investigation has been closed the full
est-report of it will be given to the
public. Â¦

Chicago Committee Supplies
a Fund for Expenses of
the Republican Convention
CHICAGO, March 28.â The sub-com
mittee of the National Republican Com
mittee, having in charge the arrange
ments for the national convention in
this city, met to-day with the local
committee to discuss the preparations
that have been made at the Coliseum,
where the convention is to be held. All
arrangements made by the local com
mittee were approved by the members
of the national committee.
It was explained to the members of
the national committee at the outset
that Chicago had never promised to put
up for the use of the national commit
tee such a sum as $15,000, nor in fact
had it promised to put up any sum of
money at all. What it had promised
was to pay all ' the bills of the con
vention and this it would do.
Harry S. New of the committee sug
gested that there were some things for
which* the national committee would be
compelled to pay, and he thought it
well if the local men would place a
certain sum at the disposal of the na
tional committee. This the local men
agreed to do at once, and the amount
suggested by Mr. New â $5000â was
promptly arranged for. It was decided
that all the bills for the convention are
to be turned over to the local commit
tee and they will provide for their pay
ment. None of them will' be presented
to the national committee, which will
be under no obligations for hny of the
expenses attendant upon the holding of
the convention.
In going over the arrangements made
for seating it was found that the total
number of seats in the hall will be
S428. Of these 500 will be on the stage
and 275 will be for the press. There
will be 990 seats for delegates and the
same number for alternates, â¢ leaving
5673 for spectators.

The steamer Alliance, which arrived

NEW YORK, March 28.â Charged
with having embezzled $100,000 in L03
Angeles, Edwin T. Masterson was fol
lowed through Europe for nine months
by agents of the Continental Building
and Loan Association of San Francisco
and a Los Angeles Sheriff, who brought
him a prisoner to New York In the
steamship Moltke of the 'Hamburg-
American line to-day. v
Masterson, who was accompanied by
his family, was taken to police head
quarters, and will be surrendered to the
Los Angeles authorities as soon as his
extradition can be arranged.
Nine months ago a rumor reached the
officials of the Continental Company in
San Francisco that it was losins
through the peculations of some em
ploye In the Los Angeles office. Sheriff
"William E.- "White traced Masterson to
a train for the East and started for
New York, but Masterson had already
sailed for Hamburg.
A police search through Holland and
Germany followed and he was arrested
at Kiel, but a defect In the extradition
papers delayed his return to this coun
try. He was brought back here in the
official charge of Germany.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Besides affecting the educational sys
tem, the passage of the bill is . the
achievement of the principal work un
dertaken by Premier Combes, and it is
believed that the Premier will now vol
untarily retire.
The parliamentary battle over the
bill was one of the severest which the
Chamber of Deputies has seen In re
cent years. The minority failed to de
velop any serious strength, but carried
its obstruction to the point of a fine
art, and, moreover. Premier Combes
suffered severely by defections fqrom
his own side, such leaders as George
Leygues (Radical Republican), Minis
ter of Public Instruction in the Wal
deck-Rousseau Cabinet; Alexander
Miller and Jose Callalux (Republican),
carrying amendments which entirely
modified the drastic character of the
original measure. . Premier Combes,
however, maintained his majorities on
the main feature of the bill, and the
closing vote was in the nature of a
personal triumph for him.
To-day's sitting of the Chamber was
marked by excitement, as the last
clauses of the bill dealt with dry ques
tions of detail upon which it was im
possible to raise a~ heated debate,, and
the battle, having been thoroughly
fought out in previous sittings, the op
position contented itself with merely
Platonic protests before the taking of
the flnal division.
The bill, which has to pass the Sen
ate, though no serious opposition to it
Is anticipated there, forbids all teach
ing by the religious orders in the ter
ritory of Fra'nce proper, and provides
for the suppression within ten years
of all orders actively holding an au
thorization to teach. , **.^
PARIS, March *8.â By the decisive
majority of 316 to 269 the Chamber of
Deputies to-night passed the Govern
ment bill for the suppression of all
forms of teaching by the religious or
ders. This supplements and completes
the work begun by ,the former Pre
mier, M. Waldeck-Rousseau, In 1901.
The flrft law suppressed the unau
thorized teaching orders which had for
a long time carried on their vocation
despite the lack of legal sanction, but
the new law does not make any dis
tinction between authorized and unau
thorized congregations, but sweeps
away the whole fabric erf teaching by
religious orders, thus in effect substi
tuting the system of state schools for
those heretofore conducted by the or
ders.
LONDON, March 28.â The Under
Foreign Secretary, Earl Percy, an
nounced in the House of Commons to-,
day that despite the British Consul's re-'
quest that the^gunboat Espiegle remain
at Newchwang, it had been decided,
after consultation with the commander
in chief of the China station, that it
would be inadvisable to keep the vessel
there.
Up to to-night no official communi
cation had reached the Foreign Of
fice confirming the declaration of mar
tial law at Newchwang, and officials
are inclined to the opinion ,that this
indicates that the Russian Govern
ment had: not yet sanctioned Viceroy
Alexieff's action.
The declaration of martial law is
somewhat anxiously discussed by the
London papers,, among which the
question has arisen as to whether
Russia is desirous of dragging China
into the conflict.
The Standard, recognizing that the
neutral powers may protest, considers
that "it will be difficult to refuse to
either belligerent the right to regard
strategic considerationsJas paramount
over all others 'n Manonurla."
The Post considers that Russia's
action is "calculated to relieve Japan
of some embarrassment by removing
some of the difficulties Japan . would
have experienced in dealing with
Newchwang in the event of it becom
ing necessary to attack the Russian
forces at that point." : .
TIENTSIN. March 28.â Lloyd's agent
at Newchwang telegraphs as follows:
"The port Is now open." Five Junks
have already arrived, .seven steamers
are due, to-morrow and several others
are expected shortly. The Russians
have, not blockaded the river up to the
present. There are no movements' of
troops and the town Is in perfect order.
The Espeigle and the Helena will un
dock on April 2." â¢
. CHEFU,. March .28. â Five British*
merchant steamships left here to-day
for Newchwang, - just before the re
ceipt of the j information that mar
tial law had been declared there.
Americans in Newchwang call atten
tion to the defeat of the aims of the
Government of the United States re
garding the establishment of American
Consuls in Manchuria, brought about
by the execution of the Russian order.
The flags of the United States and
of Great Britain were removed to-day
by the Russian military authorities
from the buildings and property in
Newchwang of Englishmen and Amer
icans. - .V'
A list of contraband goods then fol
lows. Â£hls -list includes beans and bean
cakes and other foodstuffs.
The foreign Consuls had a conference
with the civil administrator of
Newchwang this morning. The ad
ministrator informed them that the in
tention of Russia, in the order issued
yesterday, was to proclaim martial
law. as well as to annul consular juris
diction in Newchwang, and that this
jurisdiction already had been annulled.
This explanation was made because
the British Consul here had interpreted
the order of yesterday as not declar
ing martial law, and the other Consuls
were unable to comprehend the inten
tions of the Russian authorities. The
administrator agreed with the Consuls
to suspend the rigid enforcement of
this order until such time as the for
eign governments took action. It is

NEWCHWANG, March 28.â The civil
administrator late yesterday evening
notified all the foreign Consuls and res
idents of Viceroy Alexieff's order plac
ing the city and port of Newchwang
under martial law, explaining that* it
had been so ordered for the purpose
of safeguarding the commercial Inter
ests of the port. Pending the publica
tion of the full text of Viceroy Alexi
eff's order, the following regulations
are ordered . to be immediately oper
ative:
"I learn that the fleet to sail to the
Far East about June 15 will consist of
eight battleships, eleven cruisers and
torpedo-boat destroyers, the number of
which has not yet been fixed. Command
of the fleet will be intrusted to Admiral
Rojesvensky and Grand Duke Alexan
der MIchaelovltch, who will receive
sealed personal orders from the Em
peror, to be opened at sea."
The Matin's St. Petersburg corre
spondent says that the Russian Admir
alty has ordered eight 350-ton torpedo
boats from the Riga and Nevskl yards.
He adds that the type of the latest
Japanese torpedo-boats will be copied
exactly for the Russian navy, the Yar
rows having sold to the Russian Gov
ernment the plans of the latest boats
built for Japan.
"It is certain," says the St. Peters
burg correspondent of the Matin, "that
the Russian cruiser Boyarln was blown
up by touching, b.' Rifsslan 'torpedo
eight days after the torpedo transport
Yerfcsei was blown up as the result of
accidentally striking a mine at Port
Arthur. Even if this news is not con
firmed, the fact that the cruiser has
not been mentioned as participating in
the recent pperations is sufficient evi
dence. It is not known since the death
of Captain Stepanoff, commander of
the Yenesei, where the torpedoes have
been placed, hence it is impossible for
Russian ships to approach Dalny, where
there are known to be many."
PARIS, March 29.â The Petit Jour
nal's St. Petersburg correspondent says:
ST. PETERSBURG, March 28.â The
papers are all discussing the *pos
sibilfly of better relations between Rus
sia and Great Britain, through the in
termediary of France. The Novosti
continues to insist that the absence of
conflicting interests is bound to bring
Great Britain and Russia together, and
that their alliance would be of enormous
advantage to both. The N'ovoe Vremya,
however, declines to bury the hatchet,
still harping on "perfidious Albion," and
saying that Great Britain has "been
trying to fasten her Interested friend
ship upon all the European nations in
turn, but they all saw through the
game." â
The Bourse Gazette says sarcasti
cally that while Russia is strong Great
Britain will not move, her attitude to
ward Russia becoming friendly in pro
portion as she receives news of the
strengthening of the Baltic ports and
the reinforcement of the Russian army
near the Indian frontier.
In diplomatic circles the possibility
of such a new triple alliance, with its
far-reaching consequences, attracts
much attention, the opinion being that
it is not so fantastic as it first ap
peared. There is an intimation from a
well-informed quarter that King Ed
ward, who is now practically his own
Prime Minister, sincerely harbors a de
sire to compose the long-standing dif
ferences between Great Britain and the
empire of his nephew and that, while
the time is not yet ripe for the satis
faction of this desire, the way is being
paved for its consummation. A promi
nent diplomat said to-day:
"A thorough understanding between
Russia and Great Britain would be the
best possible guarantee of the world's
peace and there is no reason why the
spheres of their ambitions should not
be delimitated. The mistrust of each
other's purpose imposes upon both
countries enormous and useless bur
dens. Russia keeps three army corps
and she has built three railroads in
order to exert pressure on Great Brit
ain in^ India, although it is patent that
Russia could not conquer India without
a mastery of the sea. Great Britain Is
compelled to keep a strong garrison at
Peshawur and to fortify the Indian
frontier in order to offset the Russian
forces in Central Asia. The mainte
nance of these armaments Involves
what Cobden calls 'panic expenditures,'
equivalent to a capitalization of Â£100,
000,000. Great Britain has repeatedly
tried to come to an agreement with
Russia, but thus far something has al
ways come in -the way of such,, an
agreement. IÂ«ord Salisbury used to say
that Great Britain and Russia were
like the fairy prince and princess whom
the wicked magician always kept
apart, or like two men groping in a
dark room, anxious to shake hands,
but unable to meet each other. Per
sona.lly, I think that there can be no
Angio-Russlan entente for the present,
but sooner or later it is bound to
come."

MAIN FEATURES OF THE DAY'S WAR DEVELOPMENTS
Japan's main army in Western Korea, numbering 90,000 men, has begun to advance in
force toward the Yalu. Contrary to expectations, the Russians intend to make their stand
south of the river, artillery and infantry having taken up positions on Korean soil. Cossack
bands are harassing the Japanese troops, and skirmishes are frequent.
From Seoul comes news of a battle between Japanese infantry and Cossacks in North
western Korea. Fifty Japanese were killed, but^it is said the Cossacks were defeated.
Russia's declaration of martial lazv at Nezvchwang closes that port to commerce. r At the
outset of the zvar there zvas much talk of joint action by the powers to proclaim the neutrality
of Nezvchwang, but "Japan soon manifested a disposition to undertake the capture and occupa
tion of the town, while the Russians vigorously prepared for its. defense. Great Britain and the
United States thereupon ordered the zvithdrazval of their naval representation from the port,
thtis tacitly regarding Nezvchwang as being 'within the zvar area. It is probable that this tozvn,
which is near the mouth of the Liao River, will soon be the scene of desperate Ughting.
The St. Petersburg correspondent of a Paris newspaper reiterates the rumor that the
Russian Vladivostok squadron has returned to port with several prises, including a Japanese
warship. A private dispatch from Vladivostok several days ago asserted that Reitzenstein's

and, as Fred T. Jane writes in the
Daily Chronicle: -;. -â¢>',
"Vice Admiral Togo has been credited
with victories that he never won. with
operations that, it is now getting clear,
he never attempted, and presently he is
likely to be unjustly blamed because
no results are apparent. Togo and
Makaroff are fairly matched In mental
caliber, and though the latter has the
weaker fleet, everything points to his
ability to play a waiting game, than
which nothing Is more likely to be fatal
to the Japanese."
A statement of this sort a month ago
would have been Impossible in England.
Another expeqj. Rear Admiral Inglis,
who was very enthusiastic about
Japan's prospects not so long ago, pipes
In a much lower lay to-day. In the
Daily Telegraph this morning he pays
tribute to the energetic leadership of
the new Russian commander at Port
Arthur, and says:
"I think, now that Admiral Makaroff
has so many of his ships once more re
paired and on the qui vlve and his tor
pedo flotilla apparently In working or
der. Vice Admiral VTogo will probably
not have another opportunity of block
ing the entrance to Port Arthur."
LONDON", March 28.â Vice Admiral
Makaroff is working miracles, not only
at Port Aryifur, but in England. A
month ago the English press and public
were both equally sanguine of victory
for Japan. The public talked airily of
the capture of Port Arthur and Vladi
vostok and of the Russians being
driven out of Manchuria and back into
the recesses of Siberia, i
Expert writers of the press, of course,
knew that the task for the Japanese
was a much more difficult one, but nev
ertheless the tone of their articles gen
erally was inspired by the belief that
In the end Japan would undoubtedly
win.
Russia, it was proclaimed without
contradiction, had ceased to exist as a
naval power in the Far East. Her
ships, cooped in Port Arthur, were use
less â even worse than useless. Vice Ad
miral Togo, In the words of one writer,
"had swept the seas as clean as did
that Dutch admiral who set up a broom
at his masthead and sailed down the
English Channel."
Vice Admiral Makaroff went out to
Port Arthur, and now all this has
changed. Makaroft has done wonders.

Professor Jordan diacussed the laws
and social customs of the Mikado's

ed upon, the Russo-Japanese war, the
conflict upon which are fixed the eyes
of the entire civilized world. Profes
sor Jordan said in part:
Many people affect to believe that when the
Japanese conquer the RuFslana, - if they ever
do. that they will drive all foreigners out of
China and will arm the Chinese, forming a
great Mongolian alllajice against the rest of
the world. Now In truth there Is Just about
as much danger that the farmers of this
country will arm all their horses and cattle
and turn them loose against the cities. Just
think what; a terrible "red peril" we should
have to face If all the red cattle and bay
horses were supplied with arms and turned
loose upon our civilization.
. There Is Just about as much danger of this
as of the great "yellow peril" that we hear Â«o
much about, for Japan has other things to do
besides arming the Chinese against tf\e world.

"Without falling into the smartness
of some sorts, of journalism," the
writer continues, "the instruction
should run less to hair-splitting and
red tape and lay more stress on di
rectness and brevity. To-day college
teachers, with a few notable excep
.tions, have no clear understanding of
the needs of our best daily Journal
ism.
"In the school the teaching must be
done by expert , copy readers. The
copy reader has been a reporter and
has been slashed unmercifully. He
early learned to display the salient
features of his news in the first-sen
tence or two. He has had daily exer
cise In cutting a dull story of 2000
words to an Interesting one. of 500
words. Although he is acquainted
with no treatises of style and his
knowledge of literature and linguistics
Is not recondite, he never forgets that
tedlousness Is a cardinal sin."
Mr. Lamont has been an editor j in
Albany, New York, and Seattle. Wash
ington, where he was connected with
the Post-intelligencer. He taught Eng
lish a,t Harvard from 1892 to 1895 and
then went to Brown University as as
sociate professor in rhetoric, after
ward being raised to the higher office
of full prof essor. His connection with
the Evening Post dates from 1900.
Mr. Lamont -finds that there must be
a Â¦ radical revision in the methods of
instruction in writing. The teaching
in colleges now is done by professors
and .their assistants. The assistants
do the bulk of the drudgery and they
have been so busy correcting tons upon
tons of themes that they have become
erudite theorists. The result is that
they have turned out students who
write sentences of tolerable correct
ness, but, instead of seizing upon the
significant points, they write a sub
ject to the dregs, sprawl over illimi
table space and bury interesting facts
under a mountain of detail.

Councilman Fitzgerald's resolution
that the water rates suit be prosecuted
to final Judgment In the Supreme
Court was adopted by a vote of 9 to 2,
Councilmen Howard and Pendleton
voting no. Howard said he was op
posed to the appeal because there was
no point to be gained by the action,
provided a proper stipulation of dis
missal were signed by the water com
pany and the city. Such a stipulation,
Howard said, had been prepared by
Mayor Olney and had met the ap
proval of City Attorney McElroy.
Howard added that his reason for
favoring- a dismissal of the suit was to
stop the drain of city money that had
been going on for three years. He
said the water company had spent
$143,000 in the litigation, all of which
had been charged to the ratepayers,
and that the- city to date had s'pent
$39,000.
"It is purely a matter of cold busi
ness with me," declared Howard,
Councilman Elliott declared his be
lief that the subject of the water rates
suit ought to be dropped at least until
the bond question was out of the way.

1118 Broadway. March 28.
The City Council to-night adopted
recommendations for a bond iEsue for
general public improvements totaling
$2,518,000. The only vote against the
bonds was that of Councilman G. E.
Aitken. There were ten votes for the
bonds. City Attorney 'McElroy was di
rected to prepare the ordinance calling
the bond election and to present it to
the Council on April 4.
Additions to the original bond plan
were made recommending that public
parks be established at West Oakland,
in the Second Ward and, in the block
bounded by Fifth, Seventh. Chestnut
ard Linden streets for children's play
grounds. An allowance of $80,000 was
made for the improvement of Cemetery
Creek. An item of $32,000 was added
for the purchase of a gore block east
of Bushrod Park to be added to that
park, and bounded by Racine and
Thorne streets and Telegraph avenue.
The Item of $140,000 for wate'r meters
was eliminated, as was the proposed
169,000 for Fire Department improve

COUNCIL FAVORS
A BOND ISSUE
In commenting upon a. London
school of journalism that maintains a
"So, If the faculty must confine the
students to public occasions and can
contrive no plan for advanced work,
the school of journalism in Â¦â¢ Â¦ this re
spect will have no advance over the
college."
Y r . VALUE IS LITTLE.
"The banker, the railway president
and the politicianâ even Chauncey M.
Depew, whose heart overflows with
kindness to newspaper menâ would not
waste a minute in assisting mere stu
dents of journalism to develop the
'nose for news.* .
In the practice 6chool It Is assumed
that the art of writing accurate and
readable reports of all public affairs
that do not demand the time and at
tention of innocent third parties- will
be taught. Here special instructors
will be required because, the writer
says, "few teachers have been ground
through the mill of a newspaper office
and are fully prepared to conduct
classes in reporting." Besides, the in
struction must be of a kind that will
make more of a student than a
reporter of sermons and lectures. And
as a matter of fact there Is some in
struction that can never be obtained
except through experience. Here Mr.
Lamont says: Â»
"To sum up," Mr. Lamont says, "in
the science of journalism the school will
offer but little more than our best col
leges may; and that little â If we ex
cept the law and the ethicsâ is of minor
importance. But it will gain from hav
ing its course designeo for a particular
end, systematically developed and so
plainly marked out that wayfaring
students, though fools, shall not err
therein."
In the men of Columbia""'settlng sail
in this new craft Mr. Lamont sees a
crew of navigators setting out to cross
an unknown sea. They must be cau
tious at first, he says, because there 13
no precedent to guide them. A few
years of actual experiment is likely to
discover that the whole thing demands
changing.
The north star of this voyage into
uncertain seas, MrV Lamont points out,
is the daily newspaper. The curricu
lum must be suggested from its point
of view. And taking this into account
the school must deal with two thingsâ
the science of Journalism and the art
or practice of journalism.
The science of journalism will in
clude knowledge, of every language,
science and philosophy â there is really
no definite body of learning to be mas
tered. The journalist must take all
kn6wledge as his province. But cer
tain studies are really necessary, such
as the modern languages, history, gov
ernment, jurisprudence, diplomacy,
sociology, finance, statistics, ethics,
psychology, and art. In these studies
the school will have no advantage over
the college except that it may empha
size, group and strengthen them.
But Columbia intends other studies",
not taught in ,colleges but belonging
strictly to journalism, to be added to
this scientific course. These are the
law and ethics of journalism, newspa
per administration, manufactures and
history of the press.
PURPOSES OF SCHOOL.
Mr. Lamont is thoroughly practical
in his treatment of this subject. He
would have journalism taught, not
from the point of view of the college
professor or the theorist, but from the
point of view of journalism. There
must be a scientific and a practical
side to the curriculum, with stress laid
intelligently on the practical side of it.
There must be more directness and
less red tape and hideboundness. Even
the "reader" on the college professor's
staff must retire and give way to the
"copy reader" of the big city daily if
there is any real success to come out
of this bold venture of Mr. Pulitzer.

ALAMEDA, March 28. â General
Manager Julius Kruttschnitt of the
Southern Pacific Company has as
sured President George W.Â« Scott of
the Alameda Advancement Associa
tion that there will be no further un
necessary delay in the construction of
the new depot at the Alameda mole to
replace the one destroyed by fire
eighteen months ago.
Plans for the structure were com
pleted last year and it was expected
that after the two local franchises
were awarded to the Southern Pa
cific Company that the work of erect
ing the proposed depot would begin.
Practically nothing has been done
during the last six months toward fin
ishing the project and it was because
of this condition of affairs that Mr.
Scott interviewed Mr. Kruttschnitt.
The latter, who has but recently re
turned from New York, told the pres
ident of the Advancement Association
that he was surprised to learn that no
work had been done on the depot
while he was away and that he would
call the attention of the construction
department to the matter and have
operations commenced at once.
E. R. Anthony, one of the drectors
of the Advancement Association and
himself an official of the Southern Pa
cific Company, also spoke with Mr.
Kruttschnitt about the depot and
states that the general manager will
leave nothing undone to afford the

modation it wants at the Alameda

"Ladies and gentlemen, we are looking for
men and women to teach our school children.
If you will properly prepare yourselves to -io
that for us. and will seriously devo;e your
selves to it. we will pay you according to the
experience you may have acquired in our
service, and in order that you might be in
duced to gain that experience and be content
in your positions we will at fixed lmervals. In
order to meet your increasing needs, and to
enable you to provide for the contingencies of
o'.d age. raise your salaries by a liberal per
centage."
We need more and better teachers Cnot that
those we have are anything but good), and
we need them badly. We need more men and
women that will take up teaching as a serious
life-work and we need them badly. To RÂ»t
them we' must offer them more inducements
than we are now offering them. We ought
to pay them greater salaries and we ought to
Increase those greater salaries by substantial
percentages at fixed and not too long intervals,
so that their increasing needs may be met
and provided for But until the revenue and
taxation laws of the already overburdened
State are reformed and equalized the teachers
should seek from the counties and ciqes that
relief that should surely be theirs.
At the close of the morning session
luncheon was served at Maple Hall by

President David Starr Jordan of Stan

on "The Full Heart," and Principal A.
L. -Mann of San Francisco spoke on
"Teachers' Tenure."
If we want to get and keep the best teach
ers (and we chould have none but the very
best) we must offer such Inducements as will
tempt men and women of the brst talents to
take up school- teaching as a life work, and
not as a temporary stop-gap up to the time
they can. enter some other and more lucrative
employment. Exprlence In teaching, like ex
perience In any other profession, makes better
teachers: and experience is, of course, gained
only by yearn of practice- .. .
The first thing to be done. then, according
to jny notion, in the search for better Induce
ments for me'n and women to enter and adopt
as a life-work the profession of teaching Is
to say to them:
Our public schools are what we make them â
good If we are willing to make them stood,
poor If we are not. As it requires good work
men in a factory to turn out well -made arti
cles, Â«o It requires gcod teachers to turn out
well-made scholars frcm our public school! 1 .
and the better the teachers the better the
scholars.

Thus far the detectives have failed
to uncover any trace of Simons, who
did not go to work at the sash and door
factory this morning. Grondona is
greatly distressed, apparently, over the
Ices. He fears that suspicion might at
tach to him in the event the man he
suspects cannot be found.
Such is the explanation that Gron
dona has made to the detectives. He
assert* positively that Simons was the
only person besides himself that knew
where the money had been hidden.
Grondona claims that he counted the
sold in Simons' prÂ»Â»sence and told his
friend for what purpose it had been
collected.
Yesterday the gardener went on a
fishing excursion. When he returned
home he found that the trunk had been
broken open and the coin gone.
"Vyhyte Grondona, an Italian gar
dener, residing at Fifteenth and Wood
streets, has appealed to the police to
find $1000 which he says was stolen last
night from a trunk in his house, where
he, as a temporary custodian for the
Scavengers' Union, had hidden the gold.
Fred Simons, an employe of the Cali
fornia Sash and Door Company, resid
ing at 1120 Wood street, is suspected of
the theft. Simons has disappeared.
The money represents a fund raised
by the scavengers to fight the garbage
crematory. A committee gave the coin
to Grondona Saturday night to hold
until it could be put in a bank to-day.
Simons, who was one of Grondona's
closest friends, saw the money in its
hiding place shortly after Grondona re
ceived it.

It was a delicate mission for the com
mittee to. perform, but it did not flinch.
The members first called on President
Wheeler. Mr. Wheeler was inclined to
support Professor Cory, however, and
told the committee that he thought
that gentleman was misunderstood.
Professor Corey, he said, had been
criticized before for lack of energy in
dealing with the students and this year
he had assumed a more aggressive
policy. Mr. Wheeler soemed surprised,
however, when told about the t use of
handcuffs.
Of Professor Cory the committee saw
nothln*". though three attempts were
made. to discover him. At last the com
mittee tired of its job and left the reso

The orators came to the class meet
ing in North Hall this afternoon primed
to the muzzle with set speeches. They
helped out their speeches with newly
invented gestures and swept all oppo
sition away. The resolutions were car
ried without a dissenting voice. Then
the presiding officer. J. M. Wolfsohn,
appointed a committee to present the
resolutions to PresWent Wheeler , and
Professor Cory, the committee consist

Adams and William H. Murray.
Now this, is pretty hot. but it might
have been hotter, for in its original

this afternoon to pass a set of resolu

At last the Hedda!
What Mrs. Campbell is to Paula Tan
queray, Bernhardt to Phedre, Mrs.
Fiske last night showed herself to be
to Hedda Gabler, strangest of Ibsen's
heroines. This Is perhaps why Mrs.
Fiske has dared to programme the
piece for the week. Usually timidly
sandwiched in at a special matinee â to
local credit, be it said, always crowded
â"Hedda Gabler" this week attains to
the prominence even of a "Way Down
East" or a "King of the Opium Ring."
The experiment is piquantly interest
ing. One wonders if the local Ibsenite
will live up to his repute. He. began
well last night, and if Ibsen as we have
not before seen him interpreted here is
any temptation, the Grand Opera-house
upholstery will not lack covering this
week. . â¢
' Curiously*alike Ibsen houses are, and
so was last night's. What one might
call "business-like" is the Ibsenite
among play-goers. Madame's pompon
is forgotten in Hedda's variety. What
matters when her neighbor's eyes will
be on her face, not her back, when the
lights go up? So the jewels and frivols
stayed at home last night, and their
owners, keenly attent and richly re
sponsive, crowded the bisr theater al
most to its capacious limits.
It had much to talk of before the
curtain slowly climbed up on the one
scene of the play. Nor was the usual
orchestra there to interrupt â Strauss,
say, as Wagner has not, having yet
left unwritten the incidental music of
"Hedda Gabler." Was. Mrs. Fiske well
after last week's indisposition? There
was Nance O'Nell's Hedda Gabler, very
good, and Blanche Bates' buxom Swede.
Hew would this foremost disciple of
Ibsen differ and compare with these?
One had heard, too, that last week's
Judas would be the Eilert Lovborg.
Well? It might suit him better than
the role of Iscariot. One hoped to the
gods it would. But why not the fas
cinating Gilmore. the Aulus Fiavius of
"Mary of Magdala," and already the
matinee idol cf the hour, as Ibsen's
poet? Figman? Ah, there one was
undeniably sure of the Brack.
But the curtain is up. Comes first the
little maid of the Tesman house and
the dear old Aunt Julia, who, with
all the virtues Ibsen has cruelly chosen
to make ridiculousâ as life, as cruel,
not seldom does. Comes next Tesman,
the walking encyclopedia that Hedda
has chosen â being poor â to marry.
Singularly fit. In his suggestion of
physical Ineffectiveness, is Mr. Mack's
George Tesman, admirable in its re
serve, lack of exaggeration, and atmos
phere of lovely dullness. And then
comes Hedda, the pivot of all things.
With her first words, light, scornful,
restive, one feels the intolerable bit
she is chafing under and is plunged into
the heart of the drama.
There were moments In "Mary of
Magdala" whenâ the medium being
nobler â Mrs. Fiske touched supreme
heights. In "Hedda Gabler." with its
bitter, uncompromising: modernity,
there was but one moment â from the
actress' entrance to the shot that an
nounces her suicldel Mary of Mag
dala she actedâ and greatly. She - Is
Hedda Gabler. How -powerful is the
illusion may be measured from her
last scene. Brack has tcld Hedda of
the discover!- that it is with her pistol
that Lovborg has shot himself. She
sees herself in Brack's toils, and with
her Ignoble, fears of scandal, sits there
revolving her chances of escape. One^ â
twoâ threeâ four â who * knows how
many breath-held minutes elapse? â
she sits there, writhing, struggling, a
turned eye, a bitten Up. alone telling
the mean despair of her soul. Inter
minable the spei! seems, and one can
not move while it lasts.
Much has led up to the thrall ot It.
Phases before unnoticed In the char
acter are accentuated, rounded into
prominence In Mrs. Fiske's marvelous
reading. There Is the sensual phase.
Only the passion for power has before
â in my experience â been brought
Into relief in Hedda's makeuD. The
root sensualism of the character - is
suggested -with infinite skill by the
actress in her scene with Lovborg,
where the distracted author tells her
of the loss of his" manuscript. He
takes her hand, pouring out his woe.
She listens, with a smile at the con
tact.
It is an electric effect here where she
"opens the drawer in which the manu
script is lying, under Lovborg's very
hand, and slams it as he says he would
spare Mrs. Elvsted the pain of knowing
how he had lost it. Nothing Is forgot
ten. The ultra-refinements of the
character, the morbid - shrinking from
all that which is not good form, the

Jones. Such a series of artistically con
ceived . and : Ingeniously constructed
stage. pictures, moving and Inanimate,
have never before been presented in
Fischer's. When one . witnesses them
and then considers the limitations of

their creator had- to contend one can
only marvel how he accomplished It alL
The libretto, by Comedian Richard F.
Carroll. Is not remarkably luminous.
Unnecessarily iony speeches contribute
to the tedlousness "of a badly obscured
story and the best laugh-making lines
are suggestive of a resurrection. But
the Kerker music and the Jones stag
ing bolster the book * and make the
piece successful, as success is mea
sured by plaudits.
All the principal people, with the ein
gle exception of Mr. Kennedy, are kept
much in evidence throughout the two
acts, and the chorus bobs in and out
with a frequency ; that would make
many costume changes impossible. â¢ In
their Turkish make-up "the girls look
pretty enough to need no change, how
ever, although as much cannot be said
for some of the people whose names are

The Central Theater let loose an
avalanche of fun last night in
the rollicking farce-comedy, "The
Hustler." which kept the house In
roars of laughter from the moment
the fast and furious fun began until
the show wound up with a medley and
chorus by the whole company. The
piece Is replete with song and dance
specialties. . A Persian scarf ballet
by pupils of Bothwell Browne was a
feature. Elmer Booth, the talented
young Central comedian, had the' title
role, and filled the bill amazingly well,
while Henry Shumer, in a German
character part, was funny. Edna Ells
mere, Virginia Alnsworth and Myrtle
Vane sang popular songs, and Miss
Vane and Millar Bacon appeared to
fine advantage in a musical and scenic
sketch entitled "A Twentieth Century
Galatea." Edwin T. Emery, Ernest
Howell and Georgia Woodthorpe con
tributed to the fun-makins In well
sustained character parts. "The Hus
tler 1 * is full of incongruities, but It Is
a first class antidote for the blues, for
before the spectator gets through
laughing at one comical situation, he
is plunged Into another. The hero of
the_ piece is a son of the Emerald Isle,
engaged in the promotion of a number
of . Impossible schemes, in the further
ance of which he teaches a German
capitalist how to separate himself
from . his money In record-breaking

Lynch, ingenue. Lizzie Derlous Daly,
a new member, acts effectively and
sings pretty" well. The author. of the
piece. Mr. Carroll, has all the "fat" of
the comedy in the character of a boy
who was brought up to believe him
self a girl, and some of his scenes are
decidedly funny. As there is nothing
in. the cast to fit Mr. Kennedy he pre
sents a specialty in the second act
which consists of imitations of other
imitations of popular actors, a little
trick piano playing and a little Jig
dancing. Carl Yoho, who recently grad
uated from the chorus, made a hit with
hl3 opening sons, and when he has at
tuned his acting to comport with his
really good barytone vocalism he will
be a very useful member of the com
pany.
"Kismet'* Is on for an Indefinite run,
and at its conclusion the theater will
be closed to permit of. required struc
tural alterations.
diabolical selfishness, the Ingrained
meanness and cowardice, all are painted
with a skill absolutely sure, a vividness,
a truth and justness wholly and pain
fully compelling.
Can Mrs. Fiske be heard plainly?
In this, yes, quite; but for an occa
sional prestissimo little phraseâ all
too precious to be lost, Mrs. Fiske.

all most adequately convincing. It is

WASHINGTON, March 2S.â Attorney
Wilson, who came here solely tS insti
tute the proceedings, Jeft for Chicago
to-night. He said that in bringing the
proceedings he represented no person
or persons whatever except himself,
although he does not expect people to
believe that statement. He said that
the question appealed to him personal
ly, and that he proposed to fight the
case along to the Supreme Court of the
United States, which was the only tri
bunal that could pass finally on so Im
portant a matter.
"I am of the opinion that some Bo
gota people, who are opposed to the
I-acama canal project, are behind Wil
son. Wilson started working on the
Panama case about a month ago after
he had been visited every day for a
week by a prominent merchant of Bo
gota. He has at least five clients In
Bogota, but I have never learned their
names. In view of his connection "with
these people, the logical conclusion Is
that they are the ones that are respon
sible for the legal proceedings brought
In Washington to-day."
CHICAGO. March 21â Several influ
ential persons in Bogota are believed
to be Instigators of the suit which
was brought to-day by Attorney Wil
scn to prevent the purchase of the
Panama canal by the United States
Government. Attorney Hawes, who
occupies the same office in this city
with "Wilson, said to-night:
TACOMA. Wash.. March 23.â Norse
advices received via Damson give fur
ther details of a Wild man caught by
John McLean asd two Eskimos at
Klngegan. near Cape Prince of Walea.
He was taken to Nome asd is now con
fined in the city jaiL The man Is ap
parently 45 years of age. below medium
height, thin from hunger, redeyed and
In rags. With hair and beard reaching
to his waist and nails evidently trained
to grow around the end of his fingers
he was a sight well calculated to in
spire fear and wonder. His parka, al
though hanging, was of heavy woolen
cloth and evidently of Russian dislgn
and make. Around his neck, fastened
to a gold chain, was a small gold amu
let with a Greek .design and an ebony
Greek cross. He cannot, or will cot,
talk. :
The only solution thus far offered Is
that he is an escaped Siberian exile.
His appearance is Russian. The shape
of his bead and eyes resemble a pic
ture of Zimmerman, the Russian, who
conspired several years ago to blow up
Russian workshops, asd was sent to a
penal settlement at Sredniko'ymak in
Siberia. This settlement is nearly 40OO
miles distant from Nome, throutrh an
Arctic wilderness with the Berine
Straits lying between. How he could
have made this Journey and lived for
several years comprises one of tha
strangest mysteries of the northlasd.
McLean, the captor, says the wild man
had been in the vicinity of Kinzegan
several weeks, terrorizing natives, who
regarded him as something supernat
ural. He was taken without difficulty.
The Nome authorities refuse to rcr
mit visitors to see him until his phy
sical condition improves. So far he
seems to have no understanding be-'
yond recognising food when placed be
fore him.

certain features of the bill providing
for the purchase of camp sites for mil

The anniversary of the Paris com

Wednesday. March 16, by the survivors
of that once dreaded Institution, who
marched in Drocesslon â¢ to the Federal
ists' wall at Pere la Chaise Cemetery
and placed Immortelles and red flowers
on the graves of those who were exe
cuted by . the Versailles troops under
the command of Marquis de Gallifet.
Everything passed off very quietly.
Henri Rochefort was a prominent fig
ure with his snow-white locks. The
group had the appearance of an assem

the changes that have come. over the

Korean, however, puts this pastime to
a use altogether novel. "When the time

all his faults, "Evil disposition, impa

residing ln~~Korea, relating such an in
stance, "that no kite could be seen, but

The test of the auction-room 13 still
antagonistic to the exaggerated prices
which the violin fanciers would have
us believe show the true worth of old
violins. Some excellent specimens were
sold last week and they were nearly all
purchased by dealers, so that their
authenticity may almost be taken for
granted, but Â£200 was the highest price
secured. This was gained for a Joseph
Guarnerius of 1731, while a Jerome
Amati (with certificate by the renowned
authority, Josef Chanot) fetched Â£100, an
A. and H. Amatl of 1630 went for Â£95 and
some excellent old fiddles fetched a lit
tle over Â£50 each. I sometimes wonder
that ordinary purchasers do not buy
more at these sales, where, although no
great bargains are likely to be picked
upâ for the dealers would not allow a
violin to go to an outsider for much un
der its trade worth â yet the prices are
very greatly below those asked in the
shops, and are, of course, almost trivial
compared with the figures quoted by
some of the collectors. The Â£3000 fiddle
is in fact a myth. Nothing over Â£1000

clerk are boon companions. Dally they

Not So Formal.
WHEN the second defeat of Bryan revealed the
utter weakness of the. "once formidable alliance
between the radical Democrats and the. Popu
lists on a platform of free silver, there was a notable
outburst of activity among the politicians of the Southern
States and the beginning of what promised, to be a move
ment toward the establishment of a new era of Southern
! supremacy in Democratic councils. A- famous conven
tion was held in Atlanta and" the -chief speakers of the
occasion vied with one another in pointing out that the
hour of opportunity had come f)r the South, since- New
York and New England leadeisiiip had been discredited
by the Cleveland administrator; and Western leadership
by the double fu'lure of Bryanisli. .{;?
Utterances o! that kind were so frequently made and
were so uniforfnly well receive d throughout the South
that it looked if the Soutl em' leaders were really
going to make; a vigorous effoj-t to get control of the
party councils shape the ifarty programme as had
been done by predecessors before the war. Of
late, however, Nothing has been! heard of those high re
1 solves. There is confusion in the Democratic camp and
strife as usual between the radicals and the conserva
tives, but the South is not rushing forward to profit by
"the opportunity to assert her leadership and re-establish
harmony among the contending factions. On the con
trary, her statesmen, her politicians, her press and her
people seem to. be utterly incapable of furnishing a ra
tional platform or a competent leader for the distracted
party.
During the early months of the movement for a re
vival â¢ of Southern leadership the Atlanta Constitution
was one of the stalwart advocates of the policy. It
treated the convention in Atlanta as one of the great
political events of the time and prophesied important
things to come from the reassertion of Southern states
manship in Democratic councils. All is changed now.
The Constitution would have' the South stand
aside and let the North . and the West decide the
policy and the platform. In a recent appeal for,
harmony it declined to take, sides between even such
extremes as Parker and Hearst and said: "The Consti
tution is for the man who can win. Since the doubtful
States are the deciding factors in all calculations as to
Democratic success,, their preferences must now, natur
ally, be given prime consideration by those States which,
like Georgia, will roll up the usual Democratic majority,
whoever may be nominated." .
Xhe sentiment thus stated appears to be shared by z.
majority of the Southern papers and politicians, but there
are some exceptions. Here and there a vigorous protest
against the yellow candidate is made. Thus in South
Carolina the Greenville- News is quoted as saying: "If
any South Carolina believes" that Hearst is
the kind of man to rule this country, or who imagines
that his private character is above reproach, we promise
to make him dizzy with the revelation of certaiivthings
seen during the Spanish-American War if he will kindly
call at this office." The Richmond Times has much the
same to 'say of the, Hearst boom and adds, "It would be
suicide for any political party to nominate strch .a man."
â¢ The voices of protest, however, while emphatic enough,
are not numerous, and, as the, Constitution intimates, the
South will stand for whoever is nominated, even though
it mean political suicide! In fact, some of the Southern
papers treat the subject; flippantly as if they took no
pride in Democratic virtue and felt no shame in the pos
sibility of a disgrace to it. Â¦ Thus a Mississippi paper
says: "There is one good thing about the Hearst boom
in the South â it is circulating a lot of the coin of the
realm"; while the Nashville Banner is quoted as saying:
"Evidently Mr. Hearst does not place so much stress on
records as he does on money." ' .
That is the way the much talked of "Southern oppor
tunity" is being evaded by. men. who lack courage to seize
it.- There is no question of the opportunity. It exists
beyond a doubt. Unfortunately there can be no leader
ship without leaders and the South has not any. with
courage enough or following enough to profit by the ad
vantage offered. Â»'/. * c '

. The Indian appropriation bill which
2i3f reported to the Senate yesterday
ca*;ta*inÂ« among other things .of interest
to California' a provision that the Sec
retary 0$ the Interior is authorized and
â¢directed to investigate as to the condi
tion erf non-reservation Indians of
Northern California and report to the
next Congress. This provision was in
serted by Senator Bard in response to
many petitions coming from the North
ern California Indian Association. The
Cummiscioner of Indian Affairs will
make this investigation anyhow, but
the purpose of the provision in th!s bill
is to bring the matter before Congress
and there get action.. The Indian As
sociation wants the Government to gtva
the Indians land that they may have
homes. The petition to Ihls has pro
voked a reply from the experts at the
Carlisle School in very pronounced op
position and Acting Commissioner oÂ£
Ir.dlan Affairs A. C. Tonner has-writ
ten- the Senators along somewhat the
tame line. He deprecates the reserva-
Specking of knocking. Judge Wicker
eham himself did 5ome of this very
effectively for several Alaska measurea,

The biff batch of Alaskan bills, for
which a reallv heroic effort has been
made, it is feared by its friends, may
have to wait over with the others.
There 'are a few technical bills, grant

like, that will doubtless get through,
but for the others the chance is slim.
Friends of the bills are in hopes that
th<? House will accord the bunch an
â¢Alaskan day." as was done in the
Senate when seven more or less im
portant bills went through. Of these
the most important to Alaska was the
one creating a new Judicial division.
This bill won through Senator Nel

of its need and in spite of influential
opposition â which opposition is now at
work In the House, Judge Wicker-
Fham of the third Judicial division of

Air. Cleveland and his hope for his renominatibn.
The letter bears the Hearst earmarks and evidence of,
having been prepared on purpose, to furnish him the
chance to administer a dose of poppy to Mr. Cleveland's
friends.. This is done on the same principle as the doping
of the other fellow's horse on the race track. ' Mr. Cleve
land represents the ultra' conservatives and } Hearst
stands for Hearst, playing for the support of all the radi
cals and at the same time anxious to lull the conserva
tives into a confident inaction.
As Mr. Hearst has the advice of the most prominent
artists in political tactics it is fair to assume that; he iÂ»
trying to put the conservatives to sleep in order that he
may get delegates the while they dream. He, i3 running
for the nomination against Judge Parker, who has the
happiness to have no record.. Hearst, on the other hand,
drags*the chain of a record behind hinrnnd is desirous of
dropping it or distracting from it the attention of the
people. Members of his own party are. calling attention
to that record as something that needs the services of
tbe Board of Health, and the sanitary inspectors.
.With that phase of it Republicans have nothing to do.
They feel that if the Democracy want that kind of a man'
Hearst is the kind of a man they want. The distrust ot"
the people projects beyond any Democratic,: nominee to
the party itself. Mr. Cleveland in his day commanded
the confidence of the country, but it, stopped at him, be
cause his party repudiated him and in doing so refused to
share the confidence of the people. So it is felt now that
no matter how "safe" a candidate it .may nominate,
nothing can insure that 1 the party will be safe for the
country.
That fact seems to*.escape the managers.- It was plain
ly put by- a supporter of Mr. Olney, in Boston, who said
the proper policy was to elect a safe Democrat to the
Presidency and at the same time be sure and ..maintain'
the Republican party in power in Congress. That dis
closes-the policy of conservative Democrats whoÂ« feel
that their party cannot be trusted and that national safe
ty lies iu having a Republican Congress. Of course the
plan is whimsical to a degree. But Mr. Hearst evidently
desires conservative votes for himself and if he can be
President does not care about Congress. So he is out.
with a handful of fresh salt to pickle the tail of the con
servative Democratic bird.
Having addressed, to himself an epistle attacking Mr.
Cleveland he proceeds to- reply to it that the ex-President
is not to blame for the opinions of his appointees to the
Supreme bench, and it is wrong to expect him to stand
over them with a compelling club to enforce decisions in
line with any "view he may have. This exculpatory
opinion is gilt up one. side and down the other with at
tractions for the Cleveland Democrats. One notices im
mediately the difference between it and the brutally
harsh criticisms of Colonel Bryan. Hearst is the^tjetter"
politician. He volunteers also to defend Mr. Cleveland
against the approbation of Mr. J. J. Hill. Hill is a bad
man, yes, a trust criminal of the deepest dye, but he says
bad men may approve a good man without injuring him,
and really there is no evidence that Mr. Cleveland bowed
toward Mr. Hill in acknowledgment of his compliments.
It is almost touching this volunteer defense of the ex-
President by one who wants to step into his shoes. But
it is not always thus. In his New York Journal of March
31, 189S, Mr. Hearst attacked Cleveland by name,
describing him as "a girthy Princeton person, who came
to be no more, no less, than a living, breathing crime in
breeches." Preceding this climax' there had been since
1896 a steady stream of denunciation of Cleveland from
Mr. Hearst. He had been described as a mixture of
Caligula and Nero, and the history of royal tyrants and
of royal idiots was raked to find adequate terms of com
parison and then Mr. Hearst was obliged to confess that
Cleveland had established a new record.
Just why. the offenses of the etf>-President were made
scarlet by being in breeches was not explained, but to
the imagination of Mr. Hearst it seemed that Roman
crimes being committed without breeches were more to
be condoned. But does he still hold these sartorial
views of Mr. Cleveland in secret while defending him in
public? Ambition has before now ' diluted antagonisms^
and softened enmities, on the surface, â¢ but there are
doubts that it ever neutralized them under the quick or
in the marrow. The question now at # issue is, Did Mr.
Hearst talk from his marrow when he put Mr. Cleve
land's breeches in evidence in 1898, or does he talk from
it now when he rushes to his defense?''
CAN it be possible that the quality of Mr. Hearst's
political virtue is being diluted by his Presidential
ambition? A letter is printed on theleditorial page
of his paper attacking ex-President Cleveland because he
appointed three of the Supreme Court. Justices who dis
sented in the merger decision, and further because, Mr. J.
J. Hill- after that decision announced his confidence in
"An ounce of prevention is worth a
pound of cure." says the old saw. Cap'n
Elihu Blanks who holds the stern oar
in one of the life-saving boats not a
thousand miles from here, is mightily
of the same opinion.
Cap'n Elihu had the misfortune re
cently to have all of his upper teeth
knocked out by a clumsily handled oar
and he had to hie himself to a dentist's
ivory foundry and have a nice "plate"
made for his upper jaw. Within a
week after he had acquired his bogus
molars something happened. While the
crew of his boat was practicing th?
drill out in the briny waves where the
boat is overturned and its crew given
a swing under water before the craft
is righted, Cap'n Elihu lost his teeth.
Thirty plunks gone!
Cap'n Elihu had to have the teeth
so he went down and purchased a new
array. Then an Idea penetrated his
cerebrum. The next morning, before
the crew went out upon their weekly \
practice Cap'n Elihu might have been ,
seen busily threading a string through
the hole In the roof of his new plate.
When he took his seat in the stern of
bis boat the teeth were in their place,
but a slender black string waved from |
Cap'n tightly closed lips, its
other end fastened securely "in the top
buttonhole of his sou'wester.

The interval in the Mormon investi
gation .touching the s^at of Senator
Reed Smoot has hot caused the deep
interest in the case here to die away.
Speculation as to the outcome is heard
constantly and the judgment is very
well divided. The emphatic declara :
tion that the Senate has no choice in
face of the evidence but to declare the
seat vacant is met by the confident
assertion that nothing has appeared to
affect the defendant in the case and
that there are no grounds whatever
for unseating him. In the meantime
Smoot occupies the contested, seat
daily and looks to be one of the most
industrious Senators on the ' floor. It
is said for hip that he is considered
of pleasing personality and that down
at the Raleigh on Pennsylvania ave
nue, where he lives, he has many
friends and is popular.

Representative Bell's bill as amended
and recommended by the Secretary of
the Interior for the throwing open of a
large tract of the Round Valley Indian
reservation is in the hands of the Pub
lic Lands Committee of the' House aijd
will be reported shortly. The bill pro
vides that the lands shall be open for
homestead entries, actual settlers being
given preference and credited with the
time they have already occupied them,
and they to have five years to pay up.
It has not been determined whether
there shall be a reappraisement of value
or that the price be made $1 25 or $1 50
an acre uniformly.
Bell and Gillette; who each have bills
for public buildings of the $100,000 limit,
the one for Santa Rosa and the other
at Eureka, have arran'ged to pull to

in together for Santa Rosa next year.
Of the $193,000 standing to the
credit of the Sacramento River for im
provement, no part of it can be made
available by Congress until the War
Department submits Its estimates.
Bell and others of the delegation are
working to secure a supplemental esti
mate at the hands of Colonel Heuer,
in charge of the work on the river, to
file with the committee, in view of the
necessity created by the recent floods,
so that, the sundry civil bill will carry

The California delegation has joined
in a joint letter to Secretary Hitchcock
asking him to exclude from Yosemite
National Park certain lands embracing
about 200,000 acres and attach the same
to the Sierra forest reserve, the pur
pose being to bring the land under the
forest reserve law of 1897 and enable
the working of mines and other prop
erty, some of which is held in private
ownership. There are aboi^t 50,000 acres
In the tract which can be turned to
good account, and none of it is of any

Another ifferesting hill that is to
make the doubtful run for a finish this
session is the bill for the diversion of
the waters of the Colorado River for ir
rigation purpose?. It is now before the
Committee on Irrigation, and 13. H.
Heber, prerident of the California De
velopment Company, in whGse interest
the bill is introduced, was heard last
Tuesday. The bill raises many, interest
ins questions. The Colorado is a navi
gable stream, but this bill diverts
about all the water and leaves the bed
dry. But the Government has plans of
its own for doing the same thing, so
the* protest on that account would not
lie. The new Daniels bill is very brief
and declares on this point to the effect
that the water of the Colorado is more
vaiuable for irrigation than for naviga
tion and granting the right to all com
ers to divert it for the former purpose.
The river as now diverted by the Cali
fornia Development Company is carried
for some distance through Mexican ter
ritory, where its waters are used also
fur irrigation, and then back into Cali
fornia, so that something: of an inter
national question is raised.- The right
of the private company now working

water in face of the large plan. of the

"Winifred Norton, a buxom negTesa,
was a most voluble witness In the as
eault case of Daniel Freeman, colored,
against John Garider, white, in the
court of Judge Cabaniss yesterday. She
talked and talked and talked, with
recklessness of pronunciation and pau
city of punctuation, while bench, attor
neys and chair-warmers sat spellbound
by the oral Cow. At the end of ten
minutes, during which period she had
seemingly not effected one Intake of
breath, the Judge managed to cast off
his thralldom and stop the torrent.
In the complaint Mr. Garider was ac
cused of having assaulted Mr. Freeman
in the back yard of the latter gentle
man's residence on Jessie street, the
enly provocation for the offense being
the complainant's mild expostulation i
against the kicking of his two-year-old
puppy and other canine treasures by
the defendant. The kicking was not
denied, but in Justification of it Mr.
Garider displayed a wound on one of Â¦
his ankles, which he averred had been ;
inflicted by the teeth of the two-year- ;
old puppy prior to his assault upon
that animal.
Miss Norton had not witnessed the
quarrel between Mr. Garider and Mr.
Freeman, but she did know something
of the character respectively borne by
the parties, and she could also vouch
for the calm temperament of the Free
man kennel as a whole and the peace
able disposition of the two-year-old
puppy in particular. A more amiable
animal than that two-year-old she had
never met. As for the neighborhood
friends of Mr. Gariderâ well, perhaps
the leÂ«s she said about them the high
er they would stand in the esteem of
the court. Mr. Freeman himself was
personified respectability. She prided
herself on being a woman of few words,
and her abstention from over-indul
gence in language was, she felt certain,
her salvation from slaughter at the
Kands of the Gariderites. They were a
malicious, quarrelsome lot, and her
only wonder was that Mr. Freeman and
his dogs had escaped bodily Injury at
their hands so Ion?. She could keep
that court Interested, although in
credulous, for a week in recountal of
the outrages against the peace and dig
nity of the neighborhood committed by
the chosen cronies of Mr. Garider â out
rages which unquestionably were of his
conception and Instigation. It was at
that point of the lady's recital Judge
Cabaniss applied the brake.
Garider had witnesses â a host of
them â who had not seen his encounter
with Freeman, but knew enough about
that person and his associates to jus
tify them in asseverating that if there
was any fault in the premises he
monopolized it. A more obnoxious man
than Mr. Freeman they had never met.
They had exhausted every means of
kindling- within his heart a spark of
neighborly love, but that organ was ab
solutely Impervious to fire. They had
taken his color into consideration and
resolved to ignore it and to treat him
as .a man and a brother, but he haught
ily spurned their fraternal overtures.
They were still willing to forget and
forgive the humiliation he had visited
upon Mr. Gariderâ than whom there
was not on earth a more perfect citi
zen â if the charge were cast out of
court.
In sheer self-protection the Judge dis
missed the case.
Quartets in churches and the gospel
hymns were attacked by Professor
Charles G. Buck of the San Franclaco
Seminary in a paper he read before the
Presbyterian Ministers' Association
yesterday morning. Professor Buck
has before registered his protest
against the gospel hymn, and his criti
cism was given full report In The Call.
The poverty of the poetry and the com
position of many of the hymns came in
for severe handling In the hope that
the Presbyterian body would take care
to- adopt the standard hymns which
have been officially recognized.
The Rev. E. K. Strong joined in the
criticism and agreed fully with Pro
fessor Buck. He gave it as his opinion
that the quartet is "absolutely worth
less." He considered that the gospel
hymnal was made up generally by pad
ding.
Then the Rev. James Woodworth ex
pressed a leaning toward some of the
hymns which were the subject of dis
cussion, but advised that while there
were a number of them worthy, there
were others, he thought, should be dis
carded. "Throw out the rubbish," he
said, "and there will still be good ones
left."
The Rev. Mr. Woodworth then came
to the subject of doleful hymns, and de
clared that when his time came to die
he would not wish that "Out of the
Tomb" should be sung at his bedside,
but rather the inspiriting and lifting
gospel hymfl, "I Am So Glad That
Jeaus Loves Me."
The Rev. J. M. McElhinney in giving
support to the paper took occasion to
condemn anything that was not of the
highest and most reverent in worship.
He took exception to what he consid
ered was levity indulged in some in
stances of service. He had no sympa
thy with those who joked with their
congregation, and declared that where
it was resorted to it only aroused dis
gust. He considered that levity is hurt
ful to the Christian service.
The Rev. C. C. Herriott took part in
the discussion and was of the opinion
that while some of the gospel hymns
should never be sang there were those

tions.

OAKLAND CITY OF SAINTS.
The executive committee of the Evan
gelical Union met yesterday afternoon,
when Rev. George C. Adams, D.D., de
livered an address and made particular
allusion to the evangelistic work oC
L>r. Campbell Morgan while in the city.
Dr. Adams paid high compliment to
the dignified, thoughtful method of Dr.
Morgan, whose Ideas were those that
reach the thoughtful men and women
of a community.
While the gatherings in the city were
large and on one occasion beyond the
capacity of his capacious First Con
gregational Church, still the meetings
In Oakland, said Dr. Adams, had
brought out greater assemblages,
which he attributed to the home life,
the families of Oakland and also, he
said, "to the fact that the saints had
gone to live in Oakland, while the sin
ners remained in San Francisco."
Dr. Adams, in speaking on the sub
ject, said that in San Francisco' mar
ried couples live in lodging-houses,
apartments and boarding-houses, where
there were no children and where chil
dren were not allowed.

TO 'PRINT ADDRESSES.
A wish having been expressed by
numerous merchants who attended
the service last week at the Chamber
of Commerce under the auspices of
the Brotherhood of St. Andrew that
the addresses be printed for distri
bution, it has been decided on the ini
tiative of Robert Braden to consider

Sixteen times had James Phelps. sol
dier, slashed Fred Rolander, a com
rade, before he was disarmed of the
knife with which he evidently Intend
ed to kill, and Judge Conlan yesterday
held him to answer for assault with
intent to murder, with ball fixed at
$1000. The stabbing: took place in a
saloon, where the men had been drink-
Ing before they began to quarrel.
â¢ â¢ f
"Don't hurt her, gentlemen; please
don't hurt her!" implored the old
man.
The policemen handled her tenderly
enough.
' Myrtle and Francis Gallagher, an
aged counle accused of stealing $60
from a railroad laborer in a Minna
street lodging-house, created a little
scene in - Conlan's court while they
were awaiting examination. The man
was among the prisoners in the cage
and the woman sat outside that re
ceptacle, her back against the bars.
As the seriousness of her position be
came apparent, she began to sob and
wall, and her thrust his arm
between the bars and patted her gTay
head soothingly, while sympathetic
tears coursed down his own furrowed
cheeks. Court officers tried to quiet
the woman, but their efforts were un
availing, and when symptoms of hys
teria began to appear, the Judge hur
riedly ordered her removal.
Mabel Wallace was fined $100 for be
ing concerned in the drugging and rob
bing of George M. Wilkie, a soldier. In
a Stockton-street lodging-house on
February 16, last. Katie Donovan, who
turned State"s evidence against Mabel,
will be sentenced to-day for vagrancy.
Night Clerk Cleal, who was arrested
with the two women, was discharged
for lack of evidence sufficient to con
vict. Judge Mogan heard the cases.

"I'll take your offer under considera
tion till to-morrow," said his Honor;
"but in the meantime you would be
foolish to bank heavily oh going to
Leavenworth before you go to jail."
"I'm an -ex-professional baseball
catcher and have a chance to play with
the Leavenworth team this season."
said Albert T. Kelley to Judge Caban
iss, before whom he was arraigned for
stealing a lot of towels and bed linen
from the Perry-street hotel in which
he wa3 employed.
"You don't need towels or bed sheets
in your athletic capacity, do you?"
queried the court.
"No," answered the defendant; 'I
needed them to raise money to buy
booze, and if you let me go to Leaven
worth, I'll tell where every rag of
them can be found."
John Swanson, a bartender, struck
Charles Sastrom. _a payior, on. the head
with a club in a Fourth-street saloon
Sunday night, and he has been in
structed to explain the assault to
Judge Conlan next Wednesday. Sas
trom dwells at 20 Shipley street, but
his cranium was so badly smashed
that he was taken to the hospital in
stead of to his home, for treatment.
He will be able to appear In court to
morrow.
When she was arraigned for neglect
ing to equip with fire escapes the Oc
tavia-street boafding-house rented and
managed by her, Mrs. Annie Peyser
passed up the blame to the owner of
the premises. Architect S. Kohlberg.
and yesterday that gentleman appeared
before Judge Mogan and declared that
the fault lay with the electrician of the
building.
"Bring in the electrician and let us
find out to whom he switches the cur
rent of responsibility,"* sighed the Jtldge
to the bailiff, and a subpena issued ac
cordingly.
Pat McMahon. aged and combative,
was transferred from the County Alms
hcuse to the County Jail for ten days
by Judge Cabanis's. In a quarrel- with
another inmate of the former institu
tion last Saturday, Mr. McMahon
fcught with all the earnestness if not
the science or punching power of James
Edward Britt.
Nellie O'Grady, alias Gaynor, made
her twenty-fourth appearance before
Judge Conlan on the same old charge
of drunk and disorderly and she was
remanded for sentence tiil to-day.
When she becomes inebriated Xellie
has a habit of assaulting her sixty
year-old fathen who resides on Minna
street, near Seventh.
"A quail-on-toast appetite and a cof
fee-and-doughr.uts income form an un
fortunate combination," commented thÂ»
rourt, "and as you do not look or speak
like a habitual meal-stealer I will let
you go If the complaining witness is
willing to accept your promise to pay."
The promise was accepted.
"Ten cents was my sole cash cap
ital," pleaded Daniel to Judge Conlan,
"and once I got started eating I could
not stop until my stomach's craving
was satisfied. As soon as I get em
ployment I will pay for all I con
sumed."
Daniel Hennessey, a bookkeeper cut
of a job, ate Jl 10 worth of choice vi
ands in a Ninth-street restaurant and
then tendered one dime in payment of
his bill. The restaurateur testified- that
Daniel's order embraced the r^feuiar
dinner, from soup to nuts, and di
gressed occasionally to take In dainty

CIIICO, March 28.â Professor Stu
.benrauch and P. II. Dorsett, repre
senting the United States Department
of Agriculture, to-day finally selected
a site within three miles of Chico for
the. proposed plant introduction gar
den, for which various localities of the
State have been striving for months
past. Several* localities in. Southern
California made most liberal offers of
land and water rights.
Tlie Sacramento Valley Develop
ment Association, working in the in
terest of the Sacramento Valley, rec-.
ommended Chico to the committee,
which a couple of months ago selected
the Hooker Oak Tract of Bidwell
farm, but this was unavailable, and
the committee returned to make a new
selection. Ninety acres, three miles
southeast of Chico, being part of the
J. F.Entler farm, were selected," and
final" papers ~were. drawn to-day,
whereby the Government enters into
immediate possession.
The first work will be done to-mor
row,; preparatory to- receiving plants.
The purchase price is. ? 9000, and
(2000 or $3000 will be required for an
irrigation" system and -other improve
ments to be made by the public. It is
proposed to maintain and study at the
garden all of the plants which the De
partment of Agriculture introduces
from different parts of the world.

correct in its contention. Boxton held
that the section on that point would
have to be repealed if the board pro
posed to grant permits to clubs not
members of the Pacific Amateur As
sociation.
Eggers, who, with McClellan, had
recommended in a majority report of
the Police Committee that the permit
be granted, declared that the Amateur
Association ' had itself violated the
amateur rules and that the ordinance
had been declared unconstitutional by
the Superior Court in that it dictates
that amateur clubs must belong to a
particular association to- the, exclusion

"Now, there's one thing I want to
have thoroughly understood. Corbett
cluims that in separating the fighters
I blocked his right hand by going be
tween them. Well, if I did block his
right then I must have blocked Britt's
left, and I guess Britt's left was the
hand he was lighting with.
''Corbett says I never separated him
before in any. of his fights. Wasn't I
practically b'ea^.en to a pulp for inter
fering when ; he fought McGovern?
All I can say is that if they ever fight
here again they can have another
third man in the ring. I don't want
the job."
"I have only heard one man . say
that Corbett won and that man was
liiddy Bishop. He and. liritt recently
had it falling out over three railroad
tickets.
"Why, do you know," said Graney.
"while the former champion was slid
ing around town In a big automobile
$1000 of my coin was up as his forfeit
money, and still he says: *I thought
Graney was my friend." I was his
friendand always did what I could for
him, but when it comes right down to
the point I fail to see what he ever did
in the way of friendship for me.
Closeted with a few of his friends in
Harry Corbett'a office yesterday, after
noon, Eddie Graney went over last
Friday night's tight round by round
and for tho hundredth time since the
event said that he was warranted in
giving the decision he did, us Britt
did all the clenn fighting throughout

$25,000 Suit for slander Brought

OAKLAND, March 2S. â William
HaVemeyer. nephew of the big New
York fURar kinn?. nlÂ»-d a genensl denial
to-day of thÂ«- charges made against
him by Special Policeman Hitchcock,
who has brought suit against Have
Â¦ merer for J^:Â».000 damages on the
Rround that the defendant called him
a thief. Hitchcock patrols the Linda
Vista tract, where the Ilavemeyer
home Is" located, and claims thnt his
reputation luss been damaged bv the
statements made :ibout him and names
C M. Burnham and Thomas o'Donnell
as witnesses.
Havemoyer d^nien that he called
Hitchcock a thief or anything of that
character, or that any witnesses
Hitchcock may have heard him say
such a thing. In an interview H.ive
meyer suited that anything he said
was told Hitchcock privately and if
it was noised abroad it was through
his own action.
Next time Forest King is an an
nounced starter In a race' and he .dis
covers Lacy Crawford among the com
pany through his binoculars it is more
than likely the Oregon horse will re
fuse to leave the paddock. On Decem
ber 1 last Forest King won a race at
Oakland - and was disqualified and
placed last for bumping Last Knight.
On that occasion Lacy Crawford fin
ished third. In the fourth event yes
terday at the track across the bay
Forest King, ridden by Bonner and a
4 to L favorite, led Lacy Crawford out
a neck and Mountain, who rode the
latter, lodged a claim of foul with the
judges against the winner. The favor
ite has a mean habit of bearing in to
ward the rail, but he was plainly the
better horse and Bonner made every
effort in his power to keep his mount
straight. Mountain carried Bonner
pretty wide turning into the stretch,
and it looked as if honors were about
even anyway. The officials thought,
though, that the progress of Lacy
Crawford had been impeded and gave
the race to Barney Schreiber's horse,
placing the favorite second. Fifteen
to 1 was laid about Crawford.
The only winning public choices were
Eduardo and Handpress. Twenty
books handled the coin in the ring anil
the major portion of them had a prof
itable session. The attendance was
good.
Northwest was installed favorite for
the opening Futurity course sprint,
and for the fourth time finished sec
ond. Leading Into the stretch and
looking all over a winnex, Orchan. a
10 to 1 shot, managed to get up under
Uonner's urging, beatinfe the first
choice a head. Frivolous led Harka
out for show honors.
Harry Stover's Eduardo captured the
two-year-old scramble, starting an 11
to 20 choice. For a time It looked as if
Grenore, a smart-looking filly by Rubi
con and 25 to 1 in the betting, might
win. The favorite, however, responded
when See drew his whip, downing the
outsider very handily. Anita Knight
ran third at odds of GO to 1. Ben Eric,
the second choice, showed no inclina
tion to tramp through the muddy go-
Ing.
Handpress and Quiz fought it out in
the third, a five-furlong selling event.
Iionner, who rode Quiz, had the mis
fortune to have his stirrup leathers
slip, aud the first named horse, a 3 to 2
favorite, won by half a ' length in a
hard drive. Pickaway. piloted by Sher
wood, did not get away well and was
never better than third. Our Pride, a
20 to 1 shot, took the show.
Bonner on Flaneur furnished an in
different sort of ride, or the McCafferty
gwldlng would have been returned win
ner. Up rated his mount when he could
have taken the lead, and at the wire
finished third. David S. a 10 to 1 shot,
which Rheehan got away in front, led
throughout, receiving a nose decision
ovf>r Yellowstone, another long shot.
"With strong handling Moeorito could
have won.
In the last Routonniere, Billy Moore
and Oro Viva, the latter an even money
chance, finished noses apart on the wire
in the order named. Vanderbout had
the favorite in front turning into the
stretch and at the paddock looked a
1 to 10 shot. Then, probably becoming
tired and getting Into the deepest going
with his mount, he was outfinished.
Bontonnlere. the winner had Holbrook
on his back and closed at 6 to 1 in the
ring.

LOS ANGELES, March 2S. â Rain
changed the track conditions at Ascot
to-day and disturbed the prospects of
the form players in several Instances.
Three unfortunate starts also had
something to do with the chances of the
winners In these particular races.
Â¦ Pat Bulger won the best race of the
day at 30 to 1. It was a five and a half

GAXS GETS THE DECISION.
Yet when all was said and done, the
contest was an unsatisfactory one. The
sympathy of the cron'J was clearly
with Herrera. and it voiced its approval
of his earnest forcing tactics by repeat
ed yells at Attell to "s^yp dancing
around and fight."
Twice Attell slipped to the ground
during the mixup. but always regained
his feet at a bound. His in and out
wefrk was perfection from a scientific
standpoint. His feints were dazzling
and kept Uerrera gupsslng most of the
time.
And force the fighting the Mexican
certainly did. With the exception of
the first round, when he seemed to be
taking things easy with a view of
gauging, his slippery opponent's style,
Herrera was after his man viciously,
rushing him from rope to rope and try
ing his bf-st to "put it right over" for a
quick finish.
Thanks to Attell's elusive tactics, he
did not succeed in accomplishing his
design. Several times during the com
bat Herrera's deadly hook flashed
across Attell's guard, but in each In
stance it landed too high to take proper
effect. It was noticeable that when
ever one of these punches connected
with Attell's head Abe broke ground
as swiftly as he k,new how and showed
a decided preference for long range
boxing.
CHICAGO, March 28.â Abe Attell was
awarded the decision over Aurelia
Uerrera, the Mexican feather-weight,
at the conclusion of their six-round
Ixrut at the American Athletic Club- to
night. The local fistic critics gloated,
for things had come about as they pre
dicted, but many of the spectators
howled in disapproval, for they figured
that Uerrera should have received at
least as good as a draw on the strength
of his forcing the fighting all tbe way.

The ordinance prohibiting the pos

Chief of Police Wittman Informed
the board that the Santa Fe Railroad

An ordinance was passed to print

Gabriel Porini, a smelter from Mar
tinez, complained to Policemen Skain
and Attridge early yesterday morning
that Peter Meline. a cook, living at
21 Pacific street, had pinioned his
arms a saloon at 405 Pacific street
and taken $160 in gold from his
pockets. The officers found Meline,
who was considerably under the influ
ence of liquor, and as he told con
tradictory' stories, he was locked up
at the City Prison pending further in
vestigation. Porini was detained as a
witness.
Claims He Was Robbed.
Heney read a mass of quotations
from the opinions of Federal and State
courts, sustaining his view that the
ftjrm of the indictment was not open
to attack before the commissioner.
Nevertheless he then argued at great
length that the present indictment wa3
on all points sufficient, charging the
defendants plainly and adequately with
conspiracy. He will conclude his ar
gument this morning, when Garret W.
McEnerney and Charles S. Wheeler
will reply. Then, the commissioner's
decision will be announced. The case
may end there, or it may go on for a
month.
The Government's response to the
attacks was opened by Heney with a
downright declaration that the defend
ants had "treated the court to a spec
tacular bluff." He said in part:
The defendants came here promising r .o
show their innocence beyond <loubt. Now
they are fighting to avoid showing it. Thl?
argument has all been wide of the mark, be
cause the defendants are not charge with
havinc defrauded the Government of any land,
but with conspiring to defraud. The indict
ment ipeclfles three ways in which they
arreetl to carry on thin conspiracy. Then it
enumerates a number of overt acts committed
in furtherance of their plot. All theÂ«e thlnsra
Dimond is charged with having knowingly
promoted.
Your Honor Is not sitting h"re to try these
defendenta or to determine whether to send
them to Washington, but to fix the bail >j\
which they shall be held to appear before
the court in which they were Indicted. If no
Indictment had been found the case would be
diflsreit, but neither under the common law
nor under the statute is a defendant entitled
to a preliminary examination after he has been
Indicted. This is the law of every State, and It
Is the law of the fnited States. The Federal
courts have repeatedly held that it is not for a
commissioner or Justice cf the Peace to pass on
the sufficiency of an indictment, but that this
Is the province of the courts themselves.

The committee decided to make a per
sonal investigation of Corbett avenue,
the status of which Is in dispute.
Commissioner Casey stated that he
would inform the committee next
Thursday morning whether the Board
of \VorksÂ» has any available funds to

cadero road to Ocean avenue, the land
for which was deeded to the city by
the Spring Valley Water Company.
The Board of Supervisors yesterda}*
passed to print the two ordinances ex
tending the limits within which It is
prohibited to carry on rock-crushing or
rock-quarrying operations. The ordi
nances are the same as those recently
vetoed by Mayor Schmitz. the vetoes
having been sustained by the necessary
five votes of the Supervisors.
Chief Clerk Booker of the Spring
Valley "Water Company Sent a com
munication to thf board relative to the
claim made by Sheriff Curtis that cer
tain families are being supplied with
v.ater from the branch county jails
and that the company is collecting
rates from such families and also from
the city. Booker explains that the city
has been paying but one-twelfth of the
sum of 514.000 set aside by the budget
for water furnished for public buildings
and if any one ha* been permitted to
run pipes through the grounds of the
jails and thus obtained a supply of
water such supply has not cost the city
one cent. Booker suggests that the
Sheriff cut off all pipes leading outside
the grounds of the Jails.
The Finance Committee laid over the
passage of the demand of Dexter M.
Wright for t2S3 56 for sheet music and
orchestrations furnished to the Park
Band in order to give Supervisor Payot

$Sr>4 45, less a discount of $70 89.

Attorney for an opinion as to the legal
ity of the demand of the Post for pub
lishing notices of delinquent taxes.

Estelle Marks for infidelity. In the
last named suit one Wolfe is named
as corespondent.
Judge Murasky has taken under ad
visement the question of advisability
of amending the findings as fc-und by
him in the Maude Amber- Wilkerson
divorce proceedings. He heard argu
ment,on the point? raised in connection
with the findings yesterday.
Suits for divorce were filed by Archi
bald Charman against Mary Charman
for desertion. Bertha A. Broderick
against W. H. Broderick for cruelty.
Norah Nickells against Alfred Nickells
for neglect, Annie K. M. Schwinder
lauf of 1105 Vallejo street against Con
rad F. W. Schwinderlauf for cruelty,
she alleging that he said if he saw her
prostrate in front of a moving car he
would make no effort to save her, but
would be glad to see her run over;
Anna M. Lingenfelder against George
F. Lingenfelder for cruelty. Pedro A.
Guerrero against Rosa L. Guerrero for
desertion and Leo J. Marks aeratnst
Dr. John A. Fritz, who ten days
after Mary, his* first wife, got a
divorce from him on the ground
of cruelty took unto himself a
second wife and then after a few
months of strenuous existence, filed a
suit for divorce on the ground of cruel
ty, alleging among other things that
his new wife had hypnotized him, failed
to prove his case before Judge Seawell
yesterday. As a consequence he failed
to secure a decree of divorce, the court
awarding the decree to Mrs. Fritz on
the charges of cruelty she preferred
against him in her cress-complaint.
Judge Seawell took under submis
sion -the suit for maintenance brought
by Sadie I. Cleve against Leonard
Cleve, a pattern maker. The case was
interesting from the fact that the tes
timony showed that Mrs. Cleve had
helped her husband build their home
in the Sunset district, having fre
quently shoveled sand and helped him
shingle the roof.
Judge Hebbard granted Alma L. Ire
land a divorce from George T. Ireland
on the ground ef -cruelty. The suit was
contested bitterly by Ireland.
Decrees of divorce were also granted
to Herman F. Klant from Blanche
Klant for desertion and Elizabeth Keo
gan froto Lawrence J. Keogan for de
sertion.
Major Edward H. Plummer, Third
Infantry, who is on leave, arrived from
Washington on Saturday and reported
at headquarters yesterday.
The transport Kilpatrick, with a
large number of casuals, sailed from
Manila for New York last Saturday.
The transport Sherman arrived at
Manila yesterday. She had on board
the Twelfth Infantry, 500 recruits and
an unusually large number of casuals.
She left here March 1. and made the
voyage on schedule time.
Major Bigelow and his squadron of
Ninth Cavalry will give a problem ex
ercise drill on the golf links on Wed
nesday morning at S:30 o'clock. It will
undoubtedly prove as interesting to the
spectators as the previous drills have
been. In this present case the post
is supposed to be garrisoned by three
troops, while a fourth troop will make
an attack from an unexpected point
somewhere between First ancl Seventh
avenues. -Major Bigelow will be in com
mand of the troops on defense. Captain
Cornish in command of the attacking
troops and Lieutenant Camp and Lieu
tenant Ellis will act as umpires.
The trial of Lieutenant Frederick B.
Neilson, who is charged with duplicat
ing his pay accounts, will be resumed
to-day at 2 o'clock before the court
martial especially appointed to try his
case and also that of Lieutenant George
S. Richards Jr. It is reported that
practically all the evidence of the ac
cused will be submitted by his attor
neys, excepting some depositions that
are to be sent from Philadelphia. Lieu
tenant Neilson is reported to be san
guin* of acquittal.
The regular Season of target oractice
will begin in a few days at Point Bo
nita as soon as the new range is com
pleted. Captain Winn has had men
at work for the last two weeks, and
had the weather been good the range
would have been in order now. Infan
try troops from all posts in this de
partment will take part in this prac
tice. They will go into camp there in
battalions until they have finished the
prescribed practice. About August 20
the annual contest will take place.
Lieutenant John S. Fair. Ninth Cav
alry, who met with a serious accident
ten days ago while riding a fractious
horse, is reported to be improving. The
surgeons in charge at the General Hos
pital now think an operation will be
unnecessary.
After citing many cases in support
of his contentions, Schlesinger con
cluded by asking that the proceedings
be dismissed on the ground that the
indictment was defective, that it was
not the best evidence available in view
of the presence of the Government's
witnesses, and that the trial should
take place in Washington or Oregon.
He was followed by Samuel Knight,
one of Dlmond's attorneys, who a^ked
especially that his client be discharged
because the indictment failed to show
that he had any guilty knowledge of
unlawful acts on the part of the al-
LJut should your Honor still hold to the view
that an indictment may raise presumptive evi
dence of cullt. then we object to the form
Â»nd sufficiency of the Indictment on seveial
grounds. First, it falls to point out a single
caae of fraudulent title in the lands conveyed
by the defendants to th* Vnited State*. Tiie
allegations of fraud are all directed to the
methods of obtaining the California and On
j?i>n schoul lands transferred to the Govern
ment. Tb<Â» defendants are charged with de
frauding these States in one or another of
three ways â by using fictitious names, by
URing names of i>ersonÂ« not In goo*! faith de
slrir* to buy the school lands for their own
use, or by using the names of persons not
legally entitled to purchase the same. Hut
the Indictment does, not specifically set forth a
Â»in^le case where California or Oregon haa
bÂ«en defrauded by either ir.Â»thv>d. If It had
â¢:*c!fled any case where lands had been ob
tained in any one of these ways it would be
cood.
Furthermore, it fails to show that a crime
has been committed against the I'nlted States.
Assuming that the school lands were crlg
inally obtained by one of the methods named,
how has the Federal Government been de
frauded? It holds these lands by good title
as an innocent purchaser for value. Its title
cannot be Questioned by California or Oregon.
If the defendants have committed any act of
fraud, it Is to these States that they are an
nwerable. But Is California or Oregon de
manding the return of the lands? No. The
Government Is only defaming its own title.
We demanded a preliminary ..
and are entitled to have the Â«?vlcÂ»nc< on
which the indiotrr.ent was fotfml. The Gov
ernment's witnesses are all present here to-day
or Â«Â«re within easy reacn, as Mr. Hums has
shown, and we should be permitted to cross
examine them.
"That is all," Schlesinger remarked.
Counsel for the Government had no
cross-examination. The attorney call
ed none of the Other witnesses, out at
once moved the discharge of the de
fendant. The point made bv having
the witnesses in court was used for all
it was worth, and then he attacked the
form of the indictment on which the
Government is trying to hold Hyde
and Dimond without disclosing its evi
dence before the -trial. Schlesinger
said among other things:
"Yes; with each of them." he're
plied, "and I am familiar with what
they are prepared to tell."
ATTACKS IXDICTJIEXT.
"Ha\e you talked with these wit
nesses about the facts of the ca*e?V
Eurns was asked.
In their effort to reverse the com
missioner's ruling of Wednesday ! the
attorneys for the defense brought into
court yesterday all but three of the
Government's witnesses on whose tes
timony before the Grand Jury at Wash
ing-ton the indictment was found.
Those present in answer to the sub
penas were Walter K. Slack, Charlt-s
A Johnston, Woodford D. Harlan. Wil
liam E. Valk, John McPhaul. William
J. Burns, Benjamin F. Allen, Grant L
Tagrgart, Miss Marion L. Doyle and
Mrs. Belle A. Curtis. The presence of
these ten witnesses having been noted
Dert Schleslnger of counsel for the de
fendant, Hyde, said:
"As preliminary to a motion to dis
miss the indictment, if your Honor
please, we will call William J. Burns."
The well-known secret service man
took stand without objection fiom
the Government side, and in answer to
Schlesinger's questions admitted that
he was the special agent assigned tÂ«Â»
the case and t: at the only Government
witnesses betore the Grand Jury who
were not then before the commissioner
wore J. Knox Corbett, postmaster at
Tucson. Ariz.; D. Alexander, an ?b*
stracter of land titles living at Port
land, Or., and Thomas McCupke-. a
contracting freight agent for the South
ern Pacific Railroad, also living at
Portland.
In the land fraud case the attorneys
fur Fred A. Hyde and Henry P. Di
mond made another brave attempt yes
terday before United States Commis
sioner Heacock to have the Govern
ment's complaint dismissed and their
clients discharged. The argument con
sumed the entire day and will continuo
at 10:30 this morning. /The first motioi;
to the same effect was made last Wed
nesday, when the Government had
rested its case, after introducing the
indictment found by the Grand Jury
of the District of Columbia. The com
missioner then ruled that the indict
ment established a p:ima facie caso
sufficient to hold the defendants for
trial, unless they should contradict -it
by substantial evidence. Counsel for
the defense not only tried yesterday tu
induce the commissioner to reconsider
this decision, but made a fierce attack
upon the indictment itself as insuf
ficient, defective and charging no eiirAs
against the United States. â¢

Fall Was Brought to Death
by Poison.
Man Believed to Have Been Killed by
Coroner Leland received a report
from the City Chemist yesterday after
noon to the effect that he had found
muriatic acid in the stomach of John
H. Coe and that he expected to find
other poisons before he finished his re
searches. Coe was found dead early
last Saturday morning at the foot of
a flight of stairs leading to 19 Sixth
street. A saloon-keeper in the vicinity
informed the Coroner that a short
time previous to the discovery of the
body he saw Coe fall heavily to the
pavement and that possibly his skull
was fractured. No fractures were
found by the autopsy surgeon and the
stomach and contents were sent to the
city chemist.
It is believed that Coe's father was
a State Senator in Brooklyn. N. T.

CAIIMEX CLAIM THAT THE
COMPANY DISCRIMINATES
Allege Old Hands Are Discharged
and Places Filled by Xew Men
on Less Salary.,
Leaders of the Carmen's Union claim
that discrimination is used against the
old hands in discharging them on the
pretext of economy and the reduction j
of operating hands. Investigation I
shows, according to the allegations '
made, that the places made vacant by '
the discharge of these old hands are j
being filled by new men on a smaller i
salary than that paid to the men dis- j
charged. It is further charged that the j
new men are given to understand that J
it is not compulsory on them to Join
the union, all of which is distasteful to !
the leaders of the union and is being ;
used in labor circles to show that there I
Is ground for complaints. '

meeting elected the following officers: |

Claus Schroder, a well-known pio
neer grocer, died at his residence, 538
Gough street, on Saturday after a
brief illness.
Although his illness was regarded
as serious, death was not expected
and the announcement of his demise
will be heard with regret by his
friends. The funeral will be held to
day from St. Paulus Evangelical
Lutheran Church, corner of Eddy and
Franklin streets, at 1:30 p. m.
Deceased was a native of Mlnstedt.
Hanover, Germany, and was 63 years of
age. His wife and seven children, three
beys and four girls, survive him.
More than twenty-five years ago the
deceased established a grocery at the
corner of Franklin and McAllister
streets, when that eportion of the city
was but thinly settled. The business
kept apace with the growth of the city,
and eight years ago it, was removed to
the corner of Gough and McAllister
streets.
Mr. Schroder's personality won for
him a host of friends. He was a man
of sterling character and commanded
the respect and esteem of all those that
came in contact with him.
?
Professor Arnold Dies.
After a long and eventful career
Professor A. B. Arnold, RT. D.. who
was well known in San Francisco anÂ«l
Baltimore, where he formerly lived,
died yesterday in this city. He was
85 years of age and leaves four chil
dren. Mrs. M. H. Hecht, Dr. J. Dennis
Arnold and Harry Arnold of this city
and William E. Arnold of Xew York.
The finding of more wreckage from
the British ship Lamorna was reported
yesterday, and the rate of reinsurance
jumped to 90 per cent. The steam
schooner Alliance, which arrived yes
terday at Coos Bay from Portland, re
ports that sixteen miles southwest of
Cape Lookout she picked up one of the
Lamorna's lifeboats. The boat was up
side down, part of the gunwale was
carried away and there was a hole in
the bottom near the bow. Taken by
itself this might mean little, as boats
are frequently swept from the decks of
vessels in heavy weather. In conjunc
tion with the previously reported find
ing of wreckage, however, the under
writers take a serious view of the situ
ation.
Wreckage so far reported includes
boats, rmich woodwork, part of the
figurehead, some bedding and a pack
age of letters belonging to the mate. In
spite ot the Wreckage, however? many
believe the vessel to be all right, and
there Is no doubt that all -that has been
found r^ight have been washed over
board and the vessel still be in a sea
worthy condition. In evidence of their
faith many local speculators are buy
nig heavily of Lamorna "to arrive."
The Eaglehom and Gaetano Casa
bona are quoted at 10 per cent. The
Zwigger was taken off the board yes
terday as uninsurable.
Curacao Arrive*.
The Pacific Coast Steamship Company's
Curacao arrived yesterday from Guaymas with
tl)irty-slx passengers and a cargo of ore, con
centrates, live turtles, tomatoes and other
southern products. She brought up gold in
bricks, dust 'and nusgets valued at $200,000.
Amour the passengers were Mrs. Linda
Bryan, her three children and a party of.
friends who have been Mrs. Bryan's guests at
her mother's home in Mazatlan. The party in
cluded Miss Georgia Spleker, Miss L. Wcnzel
ber~er and Dr. Acnold Genthe. Dr. Genthe
brought back a coat of tan which will gain
him much envy. During his stay at Mazatlan
Dr. Genthe spent some time hunUng alliga
tors and so successful a hunter din he prove
that In addition to providing his friends with'
handSGme dress suit cases he proposes to up
holster his studio in alligator leather. The
alligators found the doctor a relentless enemy.
He hunted with rifle and camera. He became
bo expert that he took shots with the camera
before using the rifle and after planting the
fatal bullet dropped the firearm and with his
kodak recorded on faithful films the spasmodic
struggles of the monsters in dissolution.
The Curacao's passengers included the fol

Tranfepprt Dix Loads Mules.
The army transport Dix will sail early this
morning for the Philippines with 5500 tons of
oats In her hold and more than 200 mules
housed on her spnclous deck. The mules were
placed on board yesterday and the operation
of transferring the beasts from wharf to ship
occupied all day. The .."mules were driven
from the Presidio by mud-stained colored
troopers whose horses later formed a corral
itslde which the mules awaited their turn for
climbing the gangplank. Mule "skinners," ex
pert and notably unj>rofane, persuaded the
JoTir-legEcd passengers to climb the Incline ta
their floating stable. -All balked, some needed
more persuasion than others, but- the whole
consignment was gotten on board without se
rlcus mtehap. The men engaged in overcom
ing the mules' stubborn prejudice against leav
ing America were kept busy sidestepping the
hind-end batteries of their charges. Occasion
ally a hard-driTeu hoof landed on the antrtomy
of a mule "skinner." There were several
knockdowns, bvt no knockouts, and neither
mules nor mulestera sustained any broken
bones. Although described by a sympathetic
writer as beasts without pride of ancestry or
hdpe of progeny, the mule Is a star attraction
when he takes an ocean voyage and there waa
a bigger nnd more Interested crowd of specta
tors on Folsom-street wharf, yesterday than
has attended the sailing of many a troopship
whose passenffers were mere human belnt Â».
The Dix has on board livestock afl: follows:
204 mules. 0 mare*. 9 Jacks and one Arabian
ptnllion. The animals are In chante of twenty
fcur rlyillan employes. After taking th^ stock
on board the Dix -nulled Into the stream and
will remain nt anchor until this morning.

AGED GROCER
SUCCUMBS TO
LONG ILLNESS
WASHINGTON. March 2S.â The sun
dry civil appropriation bill was before
the House to-day, but debate took a
vide range. Gillett of Massachusetts
devoted censiderabje time to answering
eoaie of the statements recently made
on tiie floor by Splght of Mississippi
rex*r<iing tiie race Question. Ha de
clared that he had supposed that there
was co grade in t_he United States, but
that every man had a right to choose
his own frieads and associates among
liiose most in sympathy with himself,
lie defended the President for inviting
Booker T. Washington to dine with
him and said the President was a man
of big heart, as well as of birth and
breeding.
People of the North recognize, he
&aid, that mob violence ought to be
stopped, not because of sympathy for
tne criminal, but from the results that
are to c<<:ne rVom ir.
Richardson of Alabama interrupted
to say that whenever the negroes cease
attacltinff women the lynchings and
Ljrninss will cease.
Uiilett declared that the feeling in the
Norti toward the negro is stronger
thjui in the Souili: In the North, he
eaid. th?re is a stronger natural repug
:iaace toward the negro. At the same
lime, he said, the people of the North
"don't recognize this? preposterous talk
of sociai equality and inequality."
He nippesed, he said, there were no
social grades in this country. Every
man, 'he said, can choose his own
Iiitr.ds and can associate with whom
soever he pleases.
He spoke of tht- Booker T. Washing
ton incident at the White House, and
said no one had the right to say it was
a. disgrace to invite Booker T." Wash
ington to the White House.
Gillett was asked by Claud Kitchin
If he had ever invited a negro to his
table. Upon Giilett answering that he
had not Kitchin remarked: "1 want
you to practice what you preach."
A statement by Giilett that it is not
blood that makes caste brought
SInyden of Texas, who insisted that it
does make caste in this country.
"It does in some parts of the coun
try." retorted Gillett.
.You are apologizing for the Presi
dent," remarked SJayden.
This Gillett denied., but said he ad
mired the President for what he did.
"It was," h^ said, "an evidence oi a
Ing heart, ant? done by a man who had
birth, breeding and cultivation."
There are 10,000,000 negroes in the
South, he said- who cannot stay as
They are. who either have to go up or
dawn. Nobody wants the South to sub
mit to nejrro domination, he declared,
tut the outrageous tiling was that tht-y
the negroes cannot be developed
into the faculty of voting or becoming
citizens. He was surprised, he said,
that do one on ttfcÂ» Democratic side of
the House had denounced lynchings.
Oillett drev.- the fire .of many South
ern members, who plied him with many
questions regarding social equality. He
declared that this kind ot social equal
ity is artificial, and that in the United
States race does nut make superiority.
2n the South, he said, they appeal to
jace p'rf-judice. to make their section
polid against the Republicans.
Burgess of Ttxas denied that it is the
pirrpcfi? cf the South to use the negro
Question for political purposes.
Tteeder of Kansas, in defense of
Booker T. Washington, said there was
not!a person in his section who would
not /eel it an honor to invite Washing
ton to his table.
D$ ATrnond of Missouri criticized the
failure, of the Republicans to order an
Itnvestigation of .the Postoffice Depart
Â¦ ment and likened it to the mob rale
EPcken of b"y Giilett.
Chianp Clark of Missouri declared
that "he had known white men to be
lynched tt>r .attacks, and. he added,
"they pughtto be lynched, if you want
my opinion 'about it."
Trimble of Kentucky, in behalf of
the tobiiuco growers of the country.
Baidothey should be put on the same
plane as the cotton and wheat grow
ers. HÂ» made a plea for the removal
of the tax of 6 cents a pound on this
article. Â«o that the producer may reach
the consumer without paying "this in
iquitcu* and enormous tax." The
grower, he said, had but one buyer
tht 1 tobacco trustâ^nd he said because
of this tax "a foreign corporation is
robbing the American tobacco grower
rvery year upon an average of $14 -
000.000."
Ae a result of the tobacco trust
Trimble skid. th<? negro was in a worse
Jix than whpn he was a slave, because
jhen his master fed and clothed him
an<f cared for him in sickness, but to
day the. tobacco trust had forced on
him half rations and let him go hungry
andohaJf nake^i and had no compassion
lor cim.
Tile bill was laid aside and a resolu
tion adpptPd providing for the print-
Ing of 14,000 copies of the merger de
oft!on of the United States Supreme
Court, for the use of members of the
House. â¢
At 5:19 p. m. the House adjourned.
DETROIT, Mich>, March 28. â En
couraging reports from Lansing, Bat
tle Creek, Flint. Kalamazoo and other
towns where fiood damage has been
estimated up in the hundreds of thou
sands of dollars show that to-night
the danger and distress are largely
centralized In the Saginaw Valley and
around Grand Rapids, in the valley of
the Grand River. At Grand Rapids a
marked improvement is noted to-night,
yet It is estimated that 14,000 people are
In distress. On the Shiawasassee River
to-day, near Chesaning, twenty-five
families were rescued from their homes
on a sugar-beet farm just in the nick
of time before their houses were almost
entirely submerged. Gilbert Bertram,
a foreman for the sugar company, lost
his life trying to save some of the
property.
lls'DIAXAPOLJS, March 28.âNorth
ern and Central Indiana, including the
capital city, have seen the worst of
the Hood and are now repairing the
heavy damage.
Eight lives have been lost in the flood
in two Jays, and the total property loss
in the State has been estimated at from
$5,000,000 to $8,000,000.
Cities and towns at the headwaters
of the Wabash and White rivers have
only slime and mud left by the reced
ing flood to contend with, but South
western Indiana has yet to see the
worst. The crest of the flood will
reach the Ohio River in two days.
White River at Indianapolis reached 15
feet 7*i inches above low water mark,
a record height. It is expected the
damage in this county will reach $2,
â5.000, and north of this county an ad
ditional $1,000,000. In this city 1200
families were driven from their homes.
The city authorities to-day resolved
upon issuing; $10^,000 flood bonds to re
pair the damage to the public utilities,
but it is expected the loss in this one
feature will be more than double that
ligure. To-day the city has been al
most entirely without traction service
and water. It is expected the water
works will partly resume to-morrow
PETERSBURG. Ind., March 28.â The
flood situation in this county is appal
ling. White River above here is thir
teen miles wide in places and twenty
feet deep in the channel.
Patoka River, which flows through
the county's center, is three miles wide
for nearly forty miles.
Farms are under water; bridges and
fences are gone, the soil washed away
and much stock drowned. The loss
now reaches $250,000.
It is feared there will be two more
fe/H of water, which will quadruple
the loss.
LITTLE ROCK, Ark.. March 2S.â
The storms in the northwestern part of
the State caused ten deaths as fol
lows:
J. 13. Curtis, a prominent farmer of
Newton County.
Three negro children.
Six persons killed In and near
Gainesville as follows:
T. T. Williams.
Mrs. F. M. Dalton.

NEW YORK, March 29.â The follow
ing statement was given out to-day by,
John R. Dospassos, counsel for Daniel
J. Sully:
"Mr. Dospassos, counsel for Mr. Sul- j
ly, appeared before the committee ot |
creditors in the Cotton Exchange this ;
afternoon, and stated in behalf of Mr. ;
Sully that the latter desired to have j
his affairs arranged and adjusted im
mediately, and he authorized a prop
osition to his creditors of 40 cents on
the 51 cash, payable within thirty days,
and the balance in notes without in- i
terest, payable in one, two and three :
years. s
"In addition to the above he proposed
to resign to a committee of creditors all
the rights, title and interest of the firm
of D. J. Sully & Co., and D. J. Sully.
Individually, in the claim or claims
which they, or he, have against Haw
ley and Ray arising out of their joint
transaction and operations in cotton. Â»
"The committee has no power to ac
cept the proposition of Mr. Sully, but
It was agreed to immediately confer
with the receivers and with the credit
ors of D. J. Sully & Co. for the pur
pose of receiving authority to act on
the proposition.
It is understood that- the creditors'
committee will meet to-morrow. The
books of the Sully firm, it is said, show
assets of JI.IOO.O^O as a minimum, with
possibility of more.

CHICAGO. March 2S. â More general inter
est in the wheat market was manifested to
day than, had been experienced since prices
made the recent sensational advance past the
dollar mark. The tone was one of excep
tional strength, with an urgent demand
throughout the entire session. M*ny factors
contributed to the bullish situation. The
principal features at the opening were a de
crease in the world's shipments, unfavorable
crop report* frum the Southwest, and firm
cables. Initial quotations on July were *4c
lover to higher at S7Hc to S7^c. For the
first few minutes pit traders were Inclined
to sell, but the demand from commission houses
and Â«horis was eo urgent and general that
cfferlngrs soon became extremely scarce. Sen
timent was materially strengthened by ihe
sharp demand for cash wheat. During the
early part of the session there was some wil
ing of No. 1 northern at the May price*, but
alxncrt all of the stock was held at Vic pre
mium. Predictions of a big decrease In coun
try eievater stocks the. Xorthwest were an
added stimulus to speculation. -A report from
Minneapolis claimed that one company which
controls a. chain of elevators throughout the
spring whÂ«at section had sold practically all
its grain to country mills. Reports of crop
(Satrae-c continued to come In. one authority
stetirw? that half of Kansas would produce
more than a 30 per cent yleid.- Prices ad
vanced until late in the day, when July
tourtied SS^c. At that figure many of the
early buyers took profits. The result was a
reaction, the price dropping back about %e.
The decline was only temporary, however, the
demand being sufficient to cause a quick re
covery. July closed at SS^i^SSTCc. May sold
between C'.%,c and U'c. and closed at 9G%c. 1 .
Active buying by the leading bull operator
was an impc/iant clement of strength In trati-
Ir.fc In corn. Clorinr prices were at the high
point. July closed at 51 vie; May at r>3c.
Oats participated in the general advance
end ruled strong throughout the day, closing
nÂ«ar the top, with July at SS%<85S~^c
Provisions were dominated by the action of
grain. A fair scattered demand with small
otfertngs resulted In advances In all products
and caused the market to close strong. Pork
closed 20c up, lard 7 Vic hither and ribs ur>
10c.

siderable strength, as local dealers were ex
pecting a firmer market and were purchasing

There was plenty of Butter on the market
yesterday and ' the feeling was weak. Any
thing over 22c -was exceptional. The demand
was nothing extra. . There was nothing new in
Cheese. .-
â¢ Receipts of : Egss for Monday, following- a
stormy Sunday, were- free and the market was
weak. All dealers were eager, to sÂ»U and the
largest handlers let go freely at 2OÂ©21c. and
â¢ some Â«l!d not quote over 20c for the best ranch.
Stocks wwe larger than at the close on Satur
day and showed signs of another accumulation.
The situation is about thi3: Most dealers
want to sell to keep their floors clear and move
the Â£oods and are willing to let to at conces
sions, wbile th<-y are opposed by others who
are Interested in keeping the market up at all
' hazards to suit their Individual- cases. Be
tween these two conflicting forces there Is a
margin of 2c in the quotation?, which renders
It difficult to accurately quote tne market.
This is the regular annual ?eascn when nine
houses out of ten try their Ifvel beÂ«t to shape
newspaper quotations up or down according aa
their Interests demand. As stated a we*k or
ten days ago this period, which m3y aptly be
called the "fighting season," lusts about two
months, and while it exists it is a pretty diffi
cult matter to quote the market correctly.

Poultry opened the week firm, with retailers
purchasing freely in anticipation of & good de
mand for Caster. Two cars of Western were
on sale and cleaned up quickly at good prices,
large Hens having the most call. A third car
was received late In the day. and was held over
for, to-day's market. The receipts of domestic
stock were very lieht and prices were nomin
ally unchanged. Game receipts were liberal,
and as the demand was rather slack most kinds
were lower.

laide Kirk, â¢ but within ; a short time
he learned that her name was Cordelia
Botkin . and that she ' had - a husband
living in Stockton. He detailed at
length all the changes of residence the
defendant had made during ' their ac
quaintance and v how .he,, had' been, a
constant visitor, at each place.. Even
on the direct* examination the infer
ence was plain that the , relations be
tween the two were criminal.
Â¦In 1897, the defendant said, he went
to Salt Lake, where he worked on a
paper. ' During . that time he ' received
from: Mrs. Botkin. many 'letters and
of ten wrote to her. He had seen" her
write" many times r during their
acquaintance and said- he- : was fa
miliar with her handwriting. He
identified as being the: handwriting of
the -defendant -the'- address con ..the
wrapper^ of .the box of poisoned- candy
received by his wife at . Dover and ; also
said that In his opinion the two anony
mous I letters sent to Mrs/ Dunning and

scarcely tookher eyes from him,' ex

DUNNING APPEARS.
District Attorney Byington jumped
to the conclusion that the remark was
intended for the Jury and rose ' to
protest. After he had voiced it Mrs.
Botkin, sniffed contemptuously and
Knight sneered and let the matter
drop. This was the only i time I the
peace of the day was disturbed.
Detective Ed Gibson. Who arrested
Mrs. Botkin at Stockton in the latter
part of August. 1898, on a charge of
murder, was next called. He accomÂ»
panied Captain Seymour to the room
once occupied by Mrs. Botkin at the
Victoria Hotel, and took part in the
investigation there. He corroborated
Captain Seymour In his statements
and denied that he had left" any por
tion of a Haas & Son's seal in the
room for future discovery.
.William Rosello, who" claims to
have found the seal introduced in
evidence, was the next witness. He
described finding the seal under the
couch in the presence of W. W.
Barnes, then, a clerk at the Victoria
Hotel, on September 7, 1898. He said
it was under the couch, and explained
the apparent oversight of the detec
tives by, stating that it Was under the
fringe of -the rug<and not readily disÂ»
cernible. . He thought that. ,the rug 1
had been partly hurried In moving
the couch. , On cross-examination the
witness grew indefinite and uncertain.
He. was not sure whether or, not the
couch had been. "moved at all, and
couldn't state for certain whether the
torn seal was under the rug or just at
the edge of it. It was also developed
that the witness had, talked. to Barnes
after the latter had rendered. his tes
timony last Friday and had also ; read
Barnes' testimony in the newspapers.

tified her signature on money orders
made payable to her which she had
cashed with them. When Raymond
was giving his testimony Mrs. Botkin
leaned far over to Attorney Knight
and inquired in a plainly audible
voice:

Outside of Dunnlng's testimony the
day was mostly consumed by the prose
cution in the introduction and proof
of exemplars of the defendant's hand
writing. The first of this class of wit
nesses to be called wag Oscar A. Fos
ter, a letter carrier, who delivered to
Mrs. Botkin her mail in 1898 at the
Victoria Hotel. He was shown two
cards, giving the defendant's address
on California street, which he claimed
to have seen her write and identified
them as her handwriting. -'Â¦ '
Captain John Seymour, formerly chief
of detectives of this city and- at. the
time of the first Botkin trial a detec
tive sergeant who worked oh the case,
was next called and his familiar' face
and ready testimony made a pleasant
impression. In company, with Detec
tive Ed Gibson, he visited the : room
occupied by Mrs. Botkin at .the Vic
toria Hotel after the news. of the mur
ders had reached this city and while
the defendant was under, suspicion of
being the author of the crimes. He.
said he had examined the effects which
Mrs. Botkin left in storage there and
had looked for arsenic and twine, but
had found. none.
Attorney Knight went at the .witness
In a bellicose manner, but Captain Sey
mour maintained his ' good nature ' and
answered the cross-examination with-,
out any show of. irritability. To a ques
tion of Knight's as to whether or not
he had placed a seal from Haas & Son's
candy shop on the floor during any one
of his visits, the witness said he had
not. This question was in relation to
a portion of such a seal which William
Rosello claims to have found In : the
room vacated, by Mrs. Botkin -one
month after she left, the Victoria Ho
tel. Captain Seymour also said that
he had net noticed during his investi
gation a scrap of paper with writing
on it lying â¢ on ,. the couch in the' room
previously occupied by Mrs. Botklrr.
This scrap of paper was also claimed
to have been found by Rosello when
he moved into: the room vacated by
Mrs. Botklnl .
CLAIMS A DOUBLE.
EXEMPLARS INTRODUCED.
This did not happen, at least, not on
the cross-examination. . District At
torney Byingtoh drew from .the wit
ness all the pertinent facts of the re"
lations existing between the defend
ant and Dunning from. the beginning
of their acquaintance and there was
little left for the defense to adduce to
the disparagement of the ' witness.
What little remained unrevealed was
brought out by the defense, but Attor
ney Knight was clearly apprehensive
that his cross-examination might de
velop facts prejudicial to his side of
the case.
Indicative of the interest that was
felt by the spectators to the trial was
their actions after the noon adjourn
ment- Fully 200 of them, as soon as
they gained the corridor, lined up
along the walls and fought for places
with much the same spirit as the
holders of tickets to the Corbett-Britt
fight were compelled to do. Half of
the throng were women, and- they
stood more or less patiently for an
hour and a half until the doors were
thrown open for the afternoon session.
Many of them had brought lunches
and munched sandwiches and pi'e dur
ing their vigil. The attendance yes
terday, while fully as large as in days
past, was unmarked for the most part
by prominent personages and well
gowned women. The police had less
difficulty In controlling the crowd than
previously.
John P. Dunning, husband of the
woman Mrs. Cordelia Botkin Is ac
cused of murdering, was on the wit
ness stand yesterday during Mrs. Bot
kin's trial. Contrary to expectation
there were no fireworks about his tes
timony or the manner of drawing, it
forth. It was thought that when At
torney Knight came to cross-examine
the man for the love of whom the 1 de
fendant Is supposed to have sent from
this city to Dover, Del., a box of pois
oned candy addressed to Mrs. Dun
ning, through partaking of which Mrs.
Dunning and her sister, Mrs. Deane,
died from arsenical' poisoning, hide in
large patches would be torn from the
witness and that he would be held up
in contumely before the packed court
room.
of the originals he came to the conclu
sion that they were written by Mrs.
Botkin. , - ,,' .
On cross-examination Dunning ad
mitted that almost from the beginning
of . the â¢ acquaintance between himself
and the'defendatit "their relations had
been improper, even when his wife was
with him in this city. He admitted
having received and accepted from her
while in Salt Lake $40 or $50, which he
said was all ' the money she had ever
given him. Asked If : he had ever re
ceived money from other women, he re
plied that at the time of the departure
of his wife for. " Dover he had been
given $800 by Mrs. Cbrbally, a mutual
friend of theirs. "Â¦
When Dunning returned from Salt
Lake he resumed his .relations with
Mrs. Botkin, and shortly before his de
parture . for Cuba to act as a corre
spondent he lived at the Victoria Hotel,
where Mrs. Botkin had a room. He de
tailed how he broke the news to -her
that he was going to Havana, and said
that she pleaded with him to. abandon
the project, saying that he would be
better off in this city. At that time he
informed her that he did not intend to
return to San Francisco, but dn his
return from Cuba would take up his
residence in New York City with his
wife and child. On the night, of his de
parture she accompanied him to the
Sixteenth street, station, in Oakland,'
and cried bitterly, on the ferry and at
the parting on the train. â¢
"Did the defendant ever give you
money to cover your, defalcation with
the Associated Press?" asked Knight.
"She did not," replied Dunning.
"Did any woman ever give you money
to cover that defalcation?" /
"No, sir."
Somehow Knight was wary of thÂ»
witness, who preserved an outwardly
calm exterior, whatevej he might have
felt jnwardly. The cross-examination
was not nearly so humiliating and rig
orous as on the first hearing of the
case, and' Dunning was allowed to go
with only a" few barbs to rankle as a
reminder.of his experience on the stand.
Mrs. Almirah Ruoff was recalled to
identify a card with Mrs. Botkin's ad
dress on it, which the witness claimed
to have seen the defendant write, and
this writing was admitted in evidence
as an exemplar.
Mrs. Maggie Smith, in 1898 a cook
at the Victoria Hotel, testified that on
July 31 she saw Mrs. Botkin ascending
the stairs of the hotel in. a quiet, glid
ing manner, as though wishing to
avoid detection, t The witness placed
the time as about 5 o'clock in the after
noon. She safd that previously she had
been told by Mrs.:Price, the landlady,
that Mrs. Botkin was ill and that din
ner would have to be; sent to her room.
The prosecution lays; much stress On
this evidence, because that was the
afternoon on which Mrs. Botkin is al
leged to have purchased : at Haas A
Son s shop the candy subsequently
poisoned and sent to -Mrs. Dunning
Mrs. Price is ill. and it -.may be neces
sary to hold court ;at her bedside in
order to secure her < testimony in cor
roboration of Mrs. Smith.

PHILIP KLASS LEAVES â¢
HOME WHILE DEMENTED
A demand will also be made on Fos
ter & Orear for the payment of $1500
a month, the amount of their present
bid for the concession.
There will be a meeting of the State
Board, of Harbor Commissioners to
morrow. Yesterday afternoon Charles
H. Spear, president of the commission,
stated that measures would at once
be taken to give all interested parties
ample opportunity to bid for the news
stand concession, and that the privi
lege would be awarded to the highest
responsible bidder. If this policy is car
ried out the State may. get .something
like the true value of the privilege.
- Superior Judge Seawell yesterday
made an order directing that the in
junction issued some weeks ago to re
strain the State Board of Harbor Com
missioners from awarding the news
s^and privilege to James F. Rooney at
$1200 a month be made permanent. The
court holds that Foster & Orear, the
occupants of the news stand, were not
given proper, treatment and that the
Harbor Commissioners erred' in refus
ing, to consider the Foster & Orear bid
of $1500 a month.
It was shown by uncontradlcted
testimony at the trial that Rocmey was
offered $300 a month to stand in with
Foster & Orear on the old basis of $430
a month vfor the Â¦ valuable privilege.
Facts brought to light in the contro
versy show that the concession is now
and for. many years has been worth
$1500 a month, or $18,000 a year. The
revenue received by the State during
the past ten years -for the privilege
amounts to $51,600. As the concession
is admittedly worth $18,000 a year, the
State has apparently lost $128,400 by
failure of the Harbor Commissioners
to get true inside information con
cerning the real value of one privilege
at their disposal.
<- Fossa's Bonds to $15,000.
Giovanni Fossa appeared before
Judge Lawlor .yesterday for arraign
ment on a charge of murder, but at
the request of his, attorney the case
was continued till April 2. Fossa had
been released on $3000 bonds, as it
had been represented to the Judgo
that the defendant could not be con
victed of even assault to murder, as
no. weapon had been used.
After the continuance had been
granted yesterday the Judge said ho
had carefully perused the evidence
taken at the preliminary hearing anil
was satisfied : that the, defendant could
be convicted of murder, as he had
thrown Vincenzo Lavagnino "down a
long flight of stairs and Lavag'iino
had died- from the injuries received.
Under the circumstances he would x in
crease the bonds to $15,000.
Fossa and Lavignino were riv.U
scavengers and on June 1 last Fossa
invited Lavagnino to call at his house
at Bay and Franklin streets the next
evening to talk "matters over. Lavag
nino called and. It is alleged. Fossa
threw him downstairs and beat and

MOXAGHAN OX TRIAL FOR *
AX ASSAULT TO MURDER
Joseph Babitts, a seaman residing at
856 Greenwich street, reported to the
police last night that he had been held
up, brutally beaten and robbed of a
gold watch valued at $75 and $28 in cur
rency by two footpads. Babitts 1 face
plainly showed the effects'' of his en
counter with the robbers. The right
side was swollen so that articulation
was painfuL Babitts said he had been
unable to eat anything all day," not
being able to open his mouth.
The unfortunate man is a mate on
the schooner, King Cyrus, which arrived
Sunday .from Tacoma. When in this
city he resides In the rooming-house of
Mrs. C. Sharplitz, at 856 Greenwich
street. About 1' o'clock yesterday morn
ing he was going to his home and had
reached the corner of Chestnut and
Mason streets when two men Jumped
out from a doorway and asked him the
time. Babitts reached for his watch to
convey the desired information when
the taller of the two grabbed .the time
piece. The other put the muzzle of a
revolver near Babitts' face and told
him to "up with his hands." Babitts
did not comply quickly enough and was
dealt a vicious blow in the face with
the revolver.
The seaman grappled with his an
tagonists and received a kick In the
stomach which rendered him uncon
scious. "When he came to, his assail
ants had fled, and he felt for his valu
ables and found them gone also.
Babitts went to, a nearby doctor and
had his face dressed. As soon as he was
able, to leave his bed he notified the
police. Detectives were detailed on the
case. They are of the opinion .that the
job was. done by the same gang that
has committed so many depredations
in the North Beach district of late.
Yesterday morning the Japanese dis
appeared, and Miss Nutting: found that
her bureau had been rifled and the
jewel box contained in it broken open
and the articles mentioned stolen. The
Japanese did not come to work as
