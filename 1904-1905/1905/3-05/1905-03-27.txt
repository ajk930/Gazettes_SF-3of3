BOMB HURLED AT WARSAW POLICE CHIEF
A S the result of a revolutionary plot, a bomb was
â¢**â  hurled last night into the carriage ot Baron
yon Nolken, chiet of police of Warsaw. The Baron
was seriously injured, but may recover. As part
of the conspiracy, a bomb was thrown into the
police station earlier in the evening, injuring several
officers. .
OFFICER IS INJURED
BIT MAY RECOVER
RESULT OF A REVOLUTIONARY PLOT
Attempt Is Also Made on Lives of
Subordinates in a Suburb.
WARSAW, March 26. â A bomb
was thrown into the carriage of Baron
yon Nolken. Chief of Police of War
saw. -at S o'clock this evening. The
Baron was severely wounded. The at
tack was the result of an elaborate
conspiracy of the revolutionary party.
Shortly before S o'clock to-night an
elegantly dressed man went to the po
lice .station at Praga, a large suburb
of Warsaw on the other side of the
Vistula, and threw a. bomb into a
room of the station. Six policemen
were wounded and all the furniture,
as well as one wall, was destroyed.
T.he bomb thrower In trying to es
cape met a policeman and shot twice,
wounding the officer in the stomach.
The prisoner himself was wounded
ana has been placed in the hospital.
The bomb thrower is said to be a
Jew. His identity has not been es
tablished.
A telephone message was immedi
ately sent to Baron yon Nolken at
the City Hall informing him of the
outrage. Baron yon Nolken, accom
panied by a police official, took a car
riage and started immediately for
Praga. When passing the castle where
the Governor General resides a man
standing on the pavement threw a
bomb at the carriage. Baron- yon
Nolken. who was sitting on theÂ» side
nearest the assailant, received the full
charge of the bomb, while his com
panion escaped unhurt. The coach
:nan Â»as throw . from the 'box 'and
the carriage was smashed.
Baron yon Nolken was removed to
the City Hall and doctors were sum
moned, who found he had received
injuries on the head, neck, arm and
leg. His wounds are serious, but it
is believed he will recover.
Meantime the police official accom
panying Baron yon Xolken saw the
bomb thrower fleeing and pursued and
caught up with him, but the criminal
proved tht stronger and tore himself
away. Another policeman tired twice
after him without result. Half an
hour later a plain clothes policeman
was found dead in Sowia street. It
is believed he was shot by the bomb
thrower.
A girl who was passing the spot
when the bomb was thrown . was
wounded by splinters and was taken
to the hospital.
According to the theory of the po
lice the revolutionists calculated upon
Baron yon Nolken going to Praga on '
learning of the explosion of the bomb
at the station there and knew he must
pas's the castle, that being the only
road bywhich he could reach the only
bridge across the Vistula.
The affair caused great excitement.
A popular rumor says the revolution
aries adopted this course of informing
the. police that they have more bombs
besides those discovered In - the
| Powonski Cemetery Saturday.
Baron yon Nolken is very unpopu
lar. He is hated by the masses of
the Polish people, who held him re
sponsible for the sanguinary suppres
sion of the disturbances here at the
end of January. He has been here
only a year, having come from St.
Petersburg, where he was chief of the
mounted division of the police.

MEXICO PLACED
ON GOLD BASIS
President Diaz Issues Order
Carrying Out the System
Authorized by Congress
MEXICO CITY, March 26. â Presi
dent Diaz has issued a decree for the
reform of the monetary system as au
thorized by Congress in December last.
The decree establishes the "peso" or
silver dollar at a value of 50 cents
gold and the theoretical unit of the
Mexican currency is defined to be the
dollar or peso of 75 centigrams of
gold.
An important feature of the decree
is a provision for a reserve exchange
fund which, at first, will consist of
(18,000.000 or $15,000,000 and may be
Increased. The original plan did not
provide for the immediate establish
ment of this fund, but it is now
deemed wise to start with one simul
taneously with the beginning of the
new monetary system.
The mint will be closed on April
16 to the free coinage of silver and
the new monetary system will go into
effect on May 1.
The decree gives general satisfac
tion in business and financial circles.
It assures business men against losses
in importing.

TACOMA, March 26.â Wildcats and
cougars have been more numerous this
winter than usual in the forest sec

killed in various ways, but it remained
for Rex Evans, a 15-year-old boy of
Bossburg, to choke one to death.
Young Evans and John Miller found
in a deserted cabin a good-sized wild
cat which had been killing their chick
ens. Miller went to get a gun, while
Evans stood guard. The wildcat at
tempted to escape by leaping through
a s-rnaP window near where Evans
stood. As it jumped into the window
Evans seized the animal by the back
of the neck, and then with both hands
quickly choked it to death.
The people of Bossburg are praising
the boy's grit, though condemning his
judgment.
KIDNAPED
BOY TOURS

Frank Ely Rogers Re
turns in Rags to
His Home.
Shields the Aunt Who Stole
Him From His Parents
Four Years Ago.
Hungry and Penniless When He Finds
Way Back to the Scenes of
His Childhood.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHICAGO, March 26 â Lost to the i
world for nearly four years, while his
heart-broken parents and sorrowing
relatives mourned him as one deaa,
Frank Ely Rogers, the Kvanston boy
kidnaped en Juiy 1, lyOl, returned as
though from the grave to-day. The
fate of hia aunt, Miss Florence Ely,
whope insane passion for the boy in- i
duced her to steal him away from his j
parents and home, is stHl as deep a '
mystery as it was the day following ;
the kidnaping.
Ragged, dejected and weary, with
faltering footsteps as he approached
the old home of his childhood, now oc
cupied by strangers, his appearance to- i
day was in marked contrast with that,!
of the happy, smiling thirteen-year-oid '
boy who disappeared four years ago.
Not knowing that his parents had j
moved to Chicago since his disappear- i
ance, the boy, now almost a man, tim- i
idly approached the door of the old !
home tfiis afternoon. instead of the j
mother he longc-d to embrace, a strangt
woman answers! nis hesitating knock. '
With, a giekenju fr-v â¢* M* heart he
turned away arty had gone but a short
distance when Itf met a former play
mate, whom he called >>y name. The
boy did not recognize him. His dirty
appearance and torn, ragged clothing j
made a complete disguise. Hia voice |
and manner, too, were changed.
"Don't you remember me?" he asked,
with an effort to laugh.
â¢'i am Frank Rogers."
Something in the laugh sounded fa
miliar and recognition followed. The
boy took him to an old building, where
he asked him to wait while his uncle,
CÂ« M- Rogers, was notilied.
Hurrying to the old building, Rogers
found the boy and took him to his j
home. His parents were notified by i
telephone and they hurried to Evan
ston as quickly as possible. The meet
ing of the mother with her long lost
boy was pathetic. She had ceased to
hope to see him again on earth- The
boy stoutly denied that he had been |
with his aunt and said he did not know
where she was. The parents, who have
spent a fortune in searching for their
boy, took him with them to their
home in Chicago-
Little by little he told of his wan
derings, which had taken him around
the globe. Lately he had been in New
York working as a waiter in a restau
rant. Then he was in Buffalo, and he
said he had come from that city on
freight trains, stealing rides as best
he could. He was hungry and penni
less when he reached Evanston and
glad to be home again.
Dr. C. F. Ely, uncle of the boy and
brother of the aunt who kidnaped him,
was not satisfied with the explanation
given by young Rogers concerning
Miss Ely and to-morrow will institute
a search for the missing woman.
The boy had been the pet of his
aunt ever since he was a baby. So
close was this friendship that Miss Ely
could scarcely allow him out of her
sight. Her affection was returned by
young Rogers, and in order to break up
the attachment between the two Mrs.
Rogers had decided to send her son
away to school and notified Miss Ely
of the plan. On July 13, 1901, the boy
and his aunt left the Rogers, presum
ably for a walk. They did not re
turn-

READY FOR SANTA FE'S
TRIAL TO COMMENCE.
Government Finishes Gathering of Evidence
Case to Go Before
Grand Jury in
New Mexico.
Special Dispatch to The CÂ»ll.
CALL BUREAU. POST BUILDING,
WASHINGTON, March 26.â AH prep
arations for the prosecution of the
Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Rail
road Company by the Federal Govern
ment for the alleged granting: of il
legal rebates to the Colorado Fuel and
Iron Company, of which Secretary
Paul Morton was an officer, have been
completed and within a fortnight the
case will be presented to a United
States grand jury at Albuquerque,
New Mexico. If the grand jury re
turns an indictment, and legal offi
cers of the administration are confident
it will, the Government will begin the
prosecution of the case as soon as it
can get a day in court.
This prosecution may include not
only the Santa Fe, but also tho Col
orado Fuel and Iron Company, and
probably the El Paso and Southwest
pin Railroad. The law under which
the prosecution will be brought pro
vides for the punishment of not only
the corporations which grant rebates,
but a!so those which receive them.
The evidence against the El Paso and
Southwestern road is not strong and
it may escape prosecution
Since the investigation was con
cluded by the Interstate Commerce
( "ummission, the evidence has been
turned over to th>? Department of Jus
tice and by thf> Attorney General
handed to Judson Harmon, Attorney
General during the Cleveland adminis
tration, and to Mr. Judson of St.
Louis, special attorneys employed by
the Government to prosecute. They
have been engaged in going over the
evidence, and while they found a strong
case has been made out against the
Santa Fe and the Colorado company,
they also â  learned that further facts
were needed to strengthen the prose
cution. In ord<r to obtain these, J. T.
Marchand, who collected much of the i
evidence against the railroad and the
coal company for the Interstate Com
merce Commission, has been in the ser
vice of the special attorneys for some
time gathering additional facts. This
work has been completed and the Gov
ernment is now ready to take the ini
tial steps looking to prosecution. It
has been decided that the companies
and not their officers will be prose
cuted.
The penalty for the granting or re
ceiving of illegal rebates is a fine of
not less than $1000 and not more than
$20,000 for each offense-
The action of the Government
against the Santa Fe Railroad grew
out of a complaint made by the Cale
donian Coal Company of Gallup, New
Mexico, which claimed it was forced
to retire from business by the action
of the Santa Fe in granting illegal re
bates to competitors of the Caledonian
company.

SMUGGLING
IN HIDES

Europe's Paupers En
ter States by Way
oi Mexico.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, March 26.â That thou
sands of undesirable immigrants, who
either have been rejected by United
States inspectors or are physically or
otherwise unfit, are smuggled across
the Mexican border is the assertion of
Brcughton Brandenburg. He returned
on Saturday from a two months' so
journ in Mexico. Brandenburg has for
the last four years made investigations
of the immigration problem. Besides
Europeans, he says, at least 2000 Chi
nese are annually taken across the
frontier. Brandenburg says:
"I had heard that many immigrants
were being smuggled into the United
States from Mexico, yet it was weeks
before I found anything tangible to
bear out these reports, so carefully do
the agents who conduct that enter
prise conceal traces of their operations.
"One day I saw fourteen immigrants
going into a house in the City of Mex
ico. I followed them into a back room,
where two other men were sleeping. It
was expected that all this company
should live in the one apartment. I
asked to see their papers and ascer
tained that all had Â»een sent here by
an Austro- American steamship com
pany, which now operates a line of ves
sels between Trieste and Vera Crux.
They had come on the steamship Fred
da, the first ship of the line to reach
Mexico. Of the fourteen, four were
Russians, one was a Montenegrin and
the balance Austrians, en route to va
rious American cities.
"Xone of them had any money and
said they had nothing to eat. One man
was crippled. The Montenegrin was
crazy and two of the Russians had tra
choma. I asked the one from Montene
gro some questions and he became vio
lent. He had been rejected at Ellis
Island.
"I heard voices upstairs, and in that
house and in the one connected with it.
No. 9, I found 112 immigrants, all in
about the same condition. One-third of
the number were women and children.
"Chinese in large numbers are now
entering Mexico, and their coming is
encouraged. The China Commercial
Company of Hongkong receives a re
duction of 40 per cent on its tonnage
dues, provided it will send at least
eleven steamships a year to Mexico
ports "
With a total for the last week of 26.
000 aliens and with a prospect of at
least 23,000 more to come in on the
steamships arriving this week, it is
probable that all immigration figures
for New York will be broken before the
spring is ended. From all parts of Eu
rope aliens are booked to arrive and
the resources of the station at Ellis Isl
and will be taxed to the utmost.

COLUMBUS. Ohio, March 26.â Rev.
Dr. Washington Gladden, of the gen
eral council of Congregational churches
of the United States in his sermon to
day discussed thÂ« gift of 1100.000 madÂ»
by John D. Rockefeller, capitalist, ta
the American Board of Missions. HÂ«
said:
"The money proffered to our boara
of missions comes out of a colossal es
tate whose foundations were laid in
the most relentless rapacity known to
modern commercial history. The suc
cess of this business from the begin
ning until now has been largely dvÂ»
to unlawful and outrageous manipula
tions of railroad rates- The United
States Government is now engaged in
a strenuous attempt to ferret out and
punish this injustice. And the people
of the United States have a tremen
dous battle on their hands with thÂ«
corporate greed which has entrenched
itself in this stronghold and haÂ»
learned to use the railways for the
oppression of the people.
'And now, on the eve of this oat
tle. they are asked to accept a gift of
money from the man who, more com
pletely than any other, represents the
system they are summoned to tight.
I hope they are not mean enough to
take his money and then turn around
and fight him. I hope they are not so
faithless to their obligations as to take
his money a-id shut their mouths or
become his apologists.
â¢We do not want this mans money.
To accept it would be to merit the con
tempt of millions of honest men; to
reject it will strengthen our churches
in thÂ» affection and respect of mil
lions who are inclined to doubt
whether the churches love God more
than mammon."

in the state bank and describes his
visit to that institution. He says:
"The bank officials made much cere
mony of unlocking the gates of the
strong rooms, but the actual view of
>r, 1'.'i. 000. 000 of gold was found a su
premely uninteresting, tedious and de
pressing spectacle. Over 12,5<i0 sacks

in an ordinary warehouse, while 15,7
913 gold ingots, .losely packed on
shelve? like a library, less suggested
their value than the shelves of an iron
monger's store.
"The officials invited the corroppond

the sacks and shelves. That naturally
was impossible, but he had not the

which the then War Minister, 'ex
pressed the opinion that the Yalu' con

of 'Russia's ability to' cope with' Japan

take- advantage of the struggle to
threaten Russia on the west, while
Great Britain brought ~ matters to a

ASTORIA. Ore.. March 26:â The lum
be-r-laden schooner C. A. Close, which
was abandoned several days ago while
en route ttvm Vancouver, Wash., to
i=?n Francisco-, turned turtle and went
ashore some time during last night on
North Beach, at a place named Easter
brook, about ten miles north of Fort
Canby.
The- KlosÂ£ was reported yesterday
floating about off the mouth of the Co
lumbia Riven water-logged and aban
doned, by the tug Dauntless, which
brought in the oif barge Santa Paula.
Later in the day the Klose was re
ported by the lookout at Cape Disap
pointment, but it was so late in the
day and rough on the bar that no tug :
was willing to take the risk of going,
out in -search of her. To-day as the
tugs were about to start to hunt for
her word was received from North
BMCb that the schooner had turned
turtle during the night and drifted
ashore. There is a heavy surf running
at the point wh?re the craft stranded
and there 1b every likelihood of her go
ing to pieces.
Of the schooner's master. Captain :
Wagner, and the crew no word has
been heard. In local marine circles no :
hope is expressed that they have been
saved. It is almost a foregone conclu
sion that they have not been picked up
by a passing steamer, as they would
have been reported before this. It is
equally uniikely that they have gained
shore, as no point where they could
have landed is so Inaccessible to habi
tation that their presence would not
soon be made known.

â CHRISTIAN SCIENTIST ADDRESSES LARGE
AUDIENCE AT ALHAMBRA THEATER
Edward A Kimbaii
Comes Here From
Chicago.
Tells of Good His
Creed Has Done
for Man.
The Alhambra Theater was packed to
the doors yesterday afternoon by the
n.embers of the First church of Christ, i
Scientist, their fnends, and the general
public, who listened intently and with
marked appreciation to the lecture on
Christian bcience given oy Lki\vu.rd A.
Kimbali, c. S. D. Air. Kimbali is from
Chicago and is a rr.ember of the Chris
tian .- .- nee Board of Lectureship of
the First Church of Christ. Scientist,
of Boston, IX&Â£Â£.. and yesterday's lec
ture will be the only one given by him
while in this city.
The jjenereJ expression of regret was
heard at the conclusion of â  : day's
session that the distinguished visitor
would not be heard again for some
time. The lecture as under the i
auspices of the local Scientists and the '
adn.ission was free to all.
Long before 3:!5. the time for the
besir.ning of the lecture, the gallery :
v<jls riiito. and a constant stream of
people was pouring in the main doors.
By 3 o'clock the r.Jace was filled, and :
when the lecturer stepped upon the ,
stage, fifteen minutes later, there was
not a vacant seat and many were
standing.
X<> decorations were attempted be
yond a large American flag across the
; top of the proscenium arch. The only
.' otr.er feature of the gathering was the
coisp-ict body cf over a hundred peo
1 Je stated en the stage beside Mr. Kim
bali. During: the long lecture that fol
lowed there as hardly a movement in
the vast audience, so absorbed were
. those present in hat the lecturer had
Jo ?ay.
TYilliam T. X grove, one of the di
rectors of the First Church of Christ,
Scientist, of this city, was greeted cor
dfidUr when he stepped upon the stage
V-Fcortir.g Mr. Kir a'i. The applause
that greeted the speaker of the after
codd was l^ud and long, and he bowed
his acknowledgments repeatedly.
* :;LOOKIXG FOR DEIJVERAXCE.
Ati^r a short introduction by Mr.
"KilsTove,' Mr. Kimbali began his ad
ajTees and spoke in part, as follows:
â¢ "*'ihe people of earth, unreconciled to
what seems to be an intolerable fate,
have turned in every .conceivable di
5 eeuon in their effort for deliverance
irom evil, and they have failed, thus
ici.r, to find the way- There are still
the same tears, broken hearts, beds of
pa;nâ the same havoc of outrageous
fortune. Men continue to live, sicken
*thd,die, according to a philosophy of
, t,i*onÂ» which declares there is no sal
vation, this side cf the grave, no way
<uut Ail the" hell on earth but to die out.
â ; "T" this same stricken people, and
iq" this very age, comes Christian
Science, to declare that they can get
.out, naturally, lawfully, scientifically:
it% comes as a message of hope and
promise to a race which is in supreme
' r;ted.
â¢Â« -"It is self-evident that certain
things have existence. It is generally
known that they have cause, origin,
â  and basis, by reason of which they
â¢exist. Some people declare the cause to
;fcte a blind force; others that it is some
sort of intelligence, and theology af
firms that it is a conscious intelligence
or entity which may designate God.
"A consensus of enlightened belief
concerning God is that he is one su
preme, infinite, self-existent, all-inclu
eive, spiritual, individual conscious be
ingâthe sole creator of all that has
actual existence. Also that God is
Good, Life, Truth, Love, omnipresent,
omniscient and omnipotent; that he
! is the only law-maker and holds in
his grasp the destiny of all men.
-."Christian Scientists subscribe to all
these postulates without reserve, and
yet our religion is in some respects
, quite different from that of others.
The science of mind declares that to
the extent that man is governed by
the divine mind, he will manifest per
fection, health, life, welfare, prosper
ityâthe ampler."" and completeness
of harmonious existence. It was this
.--mind which was also In Christ; which
canceled temptation and sin. healed
.the sick, raised the dead, raised Jesus
' from the dead, and overcame 'the
world, the flesh, and the devil. 1 â¢ 'To be
carnally minded is death.* Sin -and
disease are the offspring of this carnal
mind; they are no part of the nature
of the procurement of the divine
mind.

tlon. All that he has made and done is
good. His laws are good, and he has
already done everything that is essen
tial to the supreme welfare of man.
LAW OF LIFE.
"God i 6 not only life, but has or
dained life and is the law of life and
health for man. The theology of
Christian Science is consistently par
allel throughout this declaration. It
also declares that God has created man
that he might have being, and not for
the purpose of inflicting upon him in
veterate agony and disease.
"We repudiate all assumption that
his law is the law of sin and death.
Sickness is contrary to God, and God
is contrary to it. God is the natural
healer of the sick, and is able, willing,
and ever ready to save mortals from
the evils imposed upon them by an ut
terly perverted sense of existence. â¢
"Concerning the divine Christ there
is among men much conflict of opin
ion. Most Christians believe he was
the Son of God, and was divinely com
missioned; that his mission was to
j preach the gospel of reform and re-
I generation, to set forth the wav and
j promise ot" salvation after death, by
I reason of his mediatorial atonement.
It is believed that, incidentally, he
did many mighty works. It is also
affirmed that he is the only Messiah
or Savior, and that his way is the only
way of salvation.
"Christian Scientists believe ail this
and yet their sense of Christianity dif
fers from that of all others. We know
that Christ was and is divine: is our
Savior or Messiah; is the 'Way.' and
we can prove it. We are confident that
when this way is scientifically under
stood and becomes scientifically opera
tive, it will manifest its savins effi
cacy by transforming the race.
"Christian Science teaches that this
proof â the deeds, the achieved results,
the mighty works â is to illustrate the
way of salvation to them that need
salvation, and that Christian salvation
is for the sick man as well as the sin
ner. All this is different from the be
lief that his work was miracuious,
meaning that it was mysterious and in
the way of intervention or violation of
law and nature.
"Jesus never intimated that his work
was mysterious. On the contrary, he
indicated the universal nature of the
divine animus by declaring?: "These
. works shall ye do.' The contrary be
liefs of men which have filtered their
way down through the dark ages lead
to the most absurd conclusions and
tax to the utmost the credulity of man.
"When Jesus healed the sick did he

destroy the work of God or devil? Was
it the mission of Jesus to destroy the
work of God? If sickness is the work
of the devil, then is God for or against
I it? If God is against and contrary to
it are his laws for or against it? If
his laws are against it are they avail
able to man? Has God created a man
who is without possible recourse to his
law and power? If he has, then why
pray for an impossibility?
"Mrs. Eddy answers all these queb
1 tions and hundreds of others in her
! text>book, "Science and Health, with
' Key to the Scriptures.' and thereby
f reconciles reason to God and dispels
! the mystery which has obscured the
science of life-.
"This book encourages us to live ac
cording to the commandments and the
sermon on the mount, and In obedience
to the highest conceivable moral stand
ard. It teaches us to be loving, char
itable, merciful, meek and pure, and
I as followers of Jesus Christ to obey
every mandate of God and Christ, eveu
to the extent of forsaking sin. preach
ing the Gospel, and healing the sick.
We are taught to love and to rely on
one infinitely good God. who Is love;
and that we may trust him to the ut
termost; indeed, we are led to believe
we cannot trust God too much nor ex
pect too much from infinite love. We
are taught to rely on the supremacy of

spirit and to know that no other re
liance and no lack of reliance is ac
ceptable to Goa or of avail to mortals.
We are taught that the mission of
Â«'hrist is in demonstration of an un
mysterious salvation, and that we may
expect more and gain more through
Christ than if we were to minimize the
scope and efficacy of his mission.
"If to be thus obedient, or to be too
explicit in obedience, be dangerous,
then we are indeed the most danger
ous people that incumber the earth.
"Read all the books on philosophy
since time began and they will not
equip you to cure one case of fibroid
tumor. Read all the commentaries,
sermons and books on theology, and
they will not enable you to heal one
case of locomotor ataxla in its worst
form. Read all the medical books and
all other books, and you cannot as a
result thereof, cure one Instance of
malignant cancer. This book. "Science
and Health," has taught people how to
cure hundreds of such cases, and they
have done it.
MRS. EDDY'S PLEA.
"For a third of a century Mrs. Eddy
has been pleading with mankind for
the recognition of its right to life,
health and holiness according to the
will of God. She has insisted that God
is the natural healer of the sick, and
that disease is contrary to God and
his will. She has discovered and made
known the science of Christian healine
and has set forth the rule whereby hu
manity Is to obtain mastery over dis
ease.
"On every one who has ever healed
the sick through and by means of di
vine power in attestation of the su
premacy of spiritual law. the world has
bestowed the antagonism and hatred
which materialism ever exhibits to
ward the spiritually minded: indeed,
there has scarcely been a reformer
since the day of Abel who has not been
hated, reviled, stoned or crucified; a
martyr to his own ministry and mis
sion.
"In view of this inveterate propen
sity of the human mind to persecute
the prophets and to resist that which
makes for its own moral and spiritual
welfare, it is not strange that with
consistent industry it has given itself
up to misrepresentation and defama
tion of Christian Science and its works
and of the leader of this cause.
"It seems futile to repine or demur
because of this ruthless habit, and it
is useless for us to protest or contend
against the baseless disposition to do
injury to ub and to our leader. Mrs
Eddy has specifically denied all the In
ventions of avil and the perverted
statements of fact, and there is but one
sufficient, adequate course for her and
for us to pursue. Her life, past and
presentâ the actual facts and activities
of her daily existence â constitute an
imperishably righteous answer and one
that will stand as answer forever.
"Every relation of truth, every sci
entific discovery, has found its way to
humanity through some man, woman
or child. It so happened that Chris
tian Science was discovered, assimi
lated and disclosed by a woman, and
forthwith, and since then there have
been many objections, all of which can
be congregated In one common belief
that woman is not fit to know the
truth. It is not strange that this bar
baric belief that mental Inferiority in
heres naturally in woman should have
penetrated so many centuries, but it is
amazing that this generation needs yet
to learn the scientific fact that there is
no reason, mental, moral or material*
physical, metaphysical or spiritual,
why woman may not know anything
that Is true, and know it as soon as a
man and as well as a man.
TRIBUTE TO WOMEN.
"I feel that I need not stand long be
fore an intelligent audience to debate
the question as to whether or no its
grand women constitute fit ministers of
God to them that sin and mourn and
suffer. I know it is expected that a

the one they starred in last week and
a lot of new songs help to liven It up.

Conried Sale On.
The sale of seats for the single per
formances of the San Francisco season
of grand opera that will be inaugurat
ed here by the Conried Metropolitan
Opera Company on Thursday evening,
April 6, at the Grand Opera-house, will
begin at the box office of the theater
this morning at 9 o'clock. Reserved
seats will be on sale far all of the rep
resentations and the scale of prices can
be found by consulting the advertise
ments. The season sale which closed
on Saturday evening assures the finan
cial success of the season beyond ques
tion, and it only remains for Mr. Con
ried and his great company of artists
to give to San Francisco the kind of
grand opera that he has given for the
last two years in New York and he will
have the support that only San Fran
cisco is capable of giving. Notwith-s,
standing the fact that there have been
a great number of season tickets sold
there are still many choice locations
left, for the Grand is a great theater
and there Is not a seat in the house
that is not a choice of vantage
from which to see and hear the great
performances that are expected. The
company, after a week of record
breaking business- in Chicago, opens a
brief engagement in the new Audito
rium in Minneapolis to-night.
chivalrous man will speak in jrracious I
terms of gracious womanhood, but I re
joice to know that the women I mean
need not, nor do they thrive on unnu
tritious compliment. Because of the
sublimity of inspiration, fidelity, cour
age or character they stand on exalted
heights which they have achieved for
themselves.
"It has been my good fortune to
know a splendid womanhood of whom
I am greatly enamored, but I never
knew one who was so meek, loving and
humble as is the leader of our cause. I
never knew one who seemed so intent
on knowing the will of God or so glad
and satisfied to do that will. I never
knew one who was so honest, so char
itable, just or kind. Her many years
of consecrated experience have ripened
into Godly reverence for and devotion
to the daily life that Is in imitation of
Christ. Her chief ambitions seems to
be to battle for humanity against sin
and disease, and to continue Without
reproach before God and man.
"Some day the world will know all
this and render tardy justice, and
meanwhile the tender, loving woman
knoweth that a million people, many
of them once dying, who have been
rescued from unspeakable depths, and
who know that^/or a generation she
has stood as the lone rock stands far
out against an angry sea, are thankful
that in spite of every contention
against her she has been faithful to
her trust"
WONDERFUL RESOURCES OF SACR AMENTO
VALLEY BEING RAPIDLY DEVELOPED.
Climate and Soil Readilu Lend
Their Aid to the Growers.
PROSPERITY EVIDENT AT EVERY TUR.Y
HAMILTON WRIGHT
SPECIAL DISPATCH TO THE CALL.
The industrial and agricultural development of the Sacra
mento Valley, which is now in progress, has prompted the Califvr
nio Promotion Committee to gather data for the information of
prospective settlers ami also of residents in the State. The Call
herewith presents a brief and interesting summary of the observa
tions of Mr. Hamilton H'right, who is making a tour of the valley
for the committee.
CORNING. March 26. â I have trav
eled more than one thousand miles in
the great Sacramento Valley. From
one end of the valley to the other it
is evident that the year 1905 will
be one of the most prosperous in its
history. All the residents of the val
ley say they have never seen th 3 feed
better. A man who has lived in dif
ferent parts of the valley forty-nine
years says he has never seen the
forage as good. Already I have seen
men cutting hay higher than their
knees. There has never been a year
when the outlook for fruit grower*
hafe been more favorable. The season
is so far advanced that the bulk of
the crop from the valley will doubt
less be marketed ahead of all material
competition. The growers will realize
fully 30 per cent more on shipments
than might be expected under normal
conditions. Grapes and pears are about
the only fruits that would be very
seriously affected by frosts at this
time, and the grapes are about a
month ahead oi th 3 season.
But the most remarkable thing
about the Sacramento Valley is the
great number of developments in
many diversified lines.
There has never been a time in
the history of the valley when
so many projects were either under
wa> or being planned. Electric and
steam transportation systems, irriga
tion RSFStems, minirfg. the development
of electric power plants whereby the
energy of Sierra streams will
be converted into electrical en
ergy, the impounding of moun
tain wnters, the breaking up
of great ranches so that intending
settlers may gain a foothold, the im
provement of the Sacramento River
and ltE tributaries and the reclamation
of a million acres of swamp land â all
these :ire among the projects either
under way or proposed â and a great
many of them are under way. The
vast ness of the enterprises is in con
sonance with the vastness of the val
ley and the diversity of its resources.
One can hardly appreciate the change
that is taking place in the valley till
one sees the opportunities that nature
has given and the manner in which
these natural resources are being
utilized.
ACTIVITY IN MINING.
In the mountains at toe head of the
valley there is activity in mining.
Thomas W. Lawson, among others, has
been attracted to the copper mines.
Redding is unusually active and Ken
net looks almost like a boom town
with its new buildings. Greater inter
est than ever is taken 'In the gold
dredging at Orovllle and In other
points in the valley. It is surmised
that the recent visit of John Hays
Hammond, the mine expert, to Oro
ville may have been for the purpose of
consolidating all the gold dredging in
terests in the district. Practically the
entire country around Orovllle is
bonded for gold dredging purposes.
There is every promise that this gold
dredging industry will double in the
next three or four years. Contracts
were recently let by one firm for five
new gold dredgers to cost $90,000 each.
The dredgers go through the country
like grubs through a rotten log, leav
ing a pile of debris behind them. They
do not, however, turn fertile country
Into an irreclaimable heap of barren
rocks, as has been erroneously stated.
Much of the country that was mined
by the- Chinese in the early days has
been leveled off and Is now covered
with fertile orchards. Contracts have
been let for the leveling of some of
the thousands of square miles raised
by the dredgers. There Is much fertile
soil among the rocks which does not
show upon the surface.
The coming of the Western Pacific
into the valley from Plumas County is
now assured. The writer conversed
with Engineer Keddie of the Western
Pacific Railroad and obtained the
news that all rights of way (with the
exception of a few non-resident own
ers) between Oroville and Beckwith
Pass had been secured. This railroad
will open up a region marvelously rich
in timber, mines and agricultural
lands. The snow on Beckwith Pass,
the highest point along the road, has
never been deeper than one foot and a
half. The valleys of Plumas County â
and there are no less than thirty great
valleys â produce excellent apples and
other deciduous fruits. But there has
been no market and the fruits have
often been fed to the hogs. There are
fields of oats in Plumas County almost
as high as a man's shoulders and one
photograph in Orovllle shows a man's
hat above a field of oats. The mines
are rich, but It has been difficult to get
modern machinery to them.
MANY ELECTRIC LINES.
The building of electric railroads
promises great things for the valley in
the next few years. Within the last
three weeks franchises have been
granted and rights of way obtained for

of these will be electric and the third
may be run either "by steam, electric
power or compressed air." This latter
road, it is understood, will make con
nections at Chico with the Butte Coun
ty railroad to Sterling.
A very important road will be that
connecting Oroville and Colusa. so that
at Colusa connection will be made with
a line of river boats to San Francisco.
Another line will connect Marysville
with Nevada City and a branch alone
this line from a point nine miles from
Auburn will be run into Auburn. In
fact, within three years there will b*
many electric lines la the valley. Prob
ably a majority of them will be run by
electric power generated from the fall
of mountain streams.
What has been termed the most stu
pendous irrigation project of this aren
eration is a project to carry water from
Iron Canyon on the Sacramento River
above Red Bluff down the west side of
the Sacramento Valley. This will virtu
ally place the whole valley under irri
gation. It is said that a power project
will also be feasible in connection with
tho proposed works at Iron Canyon.
The work of breaking up jcreat
ranches so that intending settlers may
gain a foothold is proceeding: quite rap
idly. Near Yuba City is a tract of 400
acres, which ten years ago was a wheat'
field and supported one man. Now there
are twenty-six families with nice homes,
upon It and a school-house in the cen
ter of the new community. Marysville.

that the population of Gridley has dou
bled in the last three and one-half
years. Uncle Sam's plant-introduction

Orland, Colusa. Woodland. Redding
and other cities show new homes. The
valley is going ahead and not behind
as It did in the decade from 1990 to
1900. The people are awake and pub
lic-spirited. The greatest interest Is
taken in the improvement of the Sac
ramento River, and when that is con
summated not only will danger from
floods be alleviated, but water trans
portation will encourage new in
dustries.

COLORADO SPRINGS, March 26. â
j An immense searchlight, surrounded
I by several hundred incandescent lights,
is to be mounted on the summit of
Pikes Peak this summer and the elec
tricians in charge say the lights will
be visible for over 150 miles on the

of the Summit House, says that an ef
fort will be made to make Pikes Peak
the lighthouse of the entire Rocky
Mountain region. The searchlight will

on the larger of Uncle Sam's battle
ships. The light will be used nightly
and flashed in all directions from an
altitude of 14.144 feet.

ASK ROOSEVELT
TO BE PATRON
Filipino Students at Uni
versity Want President
as Sponsor of Magazine
LETTER TO WASHINGTON
Buencamino Jr.. Son of Fam
ous Statesman in Islands,
at Head of the Enterprise
Berkeley Office San Francisco Call,
2148 Center Street, March 26.
Felipe Buencamino, son of the man
who was Secretary of State for Aguin
aldo when that warrior was head of
the Filipino Government, announced to
day that the Filipino magazine which
he, with other Filipinos now at the
University of California, are preparing
to issue, is expected to have as its
patron President Roosevelt.
Letters have been forwarded to the
President by the Filipino contingent at.
the university, of which young Buen
camino is a ruling spirit, asking per
mission to dedicate the new Filipino
magazine to him, and use hip name as
a patron. Answer to the letter is ex
pected daily. When the permission de
sired is given the magazine will be
published at once, all the details but
this having been provided for.
If President Roosevelt consents to ac
cept the dedication of the Filipino
magazine it will dispel the idea enter
tained in some quarters that the youths
from the Orient, now studying in
America at various colleges, purposed
making their magazine an organ for
the expression of any save perfectly
loyal and safe political sentiments. The
President has been informed of the pur.
poses of the magazine's founders. He
has been told that the editors and man
agers, who include representatives of
some prominent Filipino families, pur
pose binding the Filipino contingent
closer by such a publication, and also
hope to inform the American public of
the hopes and ambitions of the Filipino
youths now studying here, and the
Filipino public as well.
William H. Murray, business manager
of the Occident, a university weekly
periodical: is supervising the advertis
ing department of the new- Filipino
magazine. He expects to issue the tirst
number on April 1. The magazine is
controlled by the following officers:
Felipe Buencamino, general manage! ;
Gregoria Jaucian, president; H. Sevil
lia. vice president; P. Keys. English
editor; J. Aranita, Spanish editor.
Three-fourths of the contents of their
magazine will be printed in Spanish,
and one-fourth in English.
Buencamino Jr.. who has fathered
this unique magazine project, was one
of the first of the young Filipinos of
good family to be sent here. His father
Is wealthy, popular and powerful in
Manila. He holds an important of
ficial position under the American Gov
ernment. Although Aguinaldo is now
his intimate friend, and he has been
Aguinaldo's Secretary of State, tho fa
mous Filipino chieftain imprisoned
Buencamino when he was at Cavite
with Admiral Dewey. because Buen
camino brought the demand from the
Spanish Governor for Aguinaldo to
surrender. After that General Mac-
Arthur imprisoned Buencamino be
cause when the Spanish cause was lost
Buencamino had joined Aguinaldo. The
United States prisoner of war eventu
ally became leader of the America.nistas
and founder of the Federal or American
party of the Filipinos in Manila. Now
he practically controls Tohdo, the most
populous district of Manila, and is
rated as a great man in Luzon. The
son of this Filipino statesman, Don
Felipe Jr.. is a handsome, quick witted
sophomore at the State University, a
ward of President Wheeler, and clever
enough to see the wisdom of dedicat
ing the new Filipino magazine to Presi
dent Roosevelt. He is destined, his
friends believe, to become, as his fath
er, a famous and influential leader of
his people, their prophecies of his
eventual fame being founded upon such
achievements as this founding of a

OAKLAND. March 26. â George E.
Jacirson. John De Lancy Jr. and John
L. McVey. three well-known attor
neys of Oakland, had a narrow escape
from death yesterday afternoon in a
collision with an electric car at Thir
ty-first and Adeline streets. The bug
gy in which Jackson and his com
panions were riding was demolished
and the three men were thrown to the
ground, De lancy being rendered on
consciou*. His companions escaped
with a bad shaking up and a number
of painful bruises.
Thp scene of the accident was at the
Thirly-first street curve, where the.
tracks run so close to the sidewalk
that there is not room for a vehicle to
pass. The horse, frightened at. the
approaching car. stopped between the
track and one of the Iron poles, and
before the car, which was running
rapidly, could be stopped, the crash
came. The horse ran away with the
wrecked buggy, but was stopped a
short distance from the scene of the
accident.

RICHMOND, Cal., March 26. â This
morning about 1 o'clock Ole Johnson,
first mate of the Standard oil barge
No 93, from Redondo. while on his
way to his boat, was met by two un

is said that two suspicious characters
hdd walked from Oakland and were
seen going toward the refinery in the
afternoon. Sheriff Veale, Constable
Boquet and Policeman Tyer are on the

CONVICT CELL
AWAITS KINIRY
Murderer of Officer Smith
Accepts Doom of Life Im
prisonment Without Fight
WILL MAKE NO APPEAL
Record Shows That Prisoner
Is Charged With a Part
in Twenty-Nine Burglaries
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
1016 Broadway. March 2<5.
With a sentence of imprisonment
for Mfc confronting him, David Kiniry.
the convicted slayer of Policeman
James H. Smith, has manifested not
a sign of emotion over the verdict that
dooms him to spend the remainder of
his days inside the walls of a State
penitentiary. Although Attorney A.
L. Frick wi'l not announce what fur
ther action he will take in his client's
behalf, it is practically settled that
no appeal will be taken from the judg
ment of the court, after it has been
declared next Friday.
Kiniry appears to think the jury's
verdict was a severe one. Those who I
watched the course of the trial con
sider the prisoner lucky to have es
caped the death penalty.
As the case stands, an appeal would
avail Kiniry nothing. The police of
Oakland. Los Angeles and San Fran
cisco have been collecting evidence for
months touching his commission of
burglaries in the three cities, par
ticularly in Los Angeles. It is said
that there has been enough gathered
to prove Kiniry had a hand in twenty
nine house-breaking jobs. Trials
could be conducted indefinitely and a
record 0/ sentences piled up in case
of convictions that would amount to
lif*Â» imprisonment, whether the mur
der case were eventually won by a
legal battle.
The situation does not give Kiniry
any hope for relief in any way it
might be presented. It is therefore
conceded in courthouse circles
that the case will take its
course and that , there will be no
move made to stay the execution of
the law's judgment. Kiniry will go
to prison at the age of 22 years. His
orimiTial career began about six years
a^o. With a keen perception and un
equaled nerve he schooled himself in
such mental and physical attributes
as would best equip him for his chosen
career of crime. His daring was
coupled with a cold-blooded delibera
tion.
LAST SFR VICES ARE HELD
OVER WELL-KNOWN PRINTER
Michael Monahan Is Laid at Aest
in Holy Cross Cemetery and
Many Motirn Him.
Michael Monahan, a well-known
printer, was laid at rest yesterday at
Holy Cross Cemetery. Tne funeral ser
vices were held at St. Charles Borro
meo s Church. A delegation from the
Typographical Union and also a rep
resentation of members of the Union
Printers' Mutual Aid Society paid re
spects to their departed member.
Previous to the departure of the
funeral to the church, there was a
short service at the mortuary chapel,
at which Will J. White, the trustee for
the Union Printers' Home, made a few
remarks of tribute to the deceased. A
printers' quartet, composed of David
Hughes, E. S. Belcher, J. E. Hooper
and J. J. Chaudet, with Will J. French,
the president of the union, as organist,
sang "Nearer, My God, to Thee,"' and
"Rock of Ages." The interment was at
Holy Cross Cemetery, where religious
services were also conducted by the
Rev. Father Moran. the assistant pas
tor of St. Charles Church.
Mr. Monahan was a native of County
Cay&n. Ireland, and was nearly
seventy-five years of age. He had been
a member of San Francisco Typo
graphical Union for many years, and
held many offices in that organization.
He was one of the organizers of the
Union Printers' Mutual Aid Society
and was held in high esteem among the
members of the printing craft. l\*

JOHNSON ENTERTAINS CROWD
WITH HIS CLEVER BOXIM,
Colored Man and Hart Seem in Splen
did Condition for Their
Meeting.
Both Jack Johnson and Marvin Hart
completed their training yesterday
afternoon for their fight to-morrow
night in Woodward's Pavilion. Jack
Johnson worked before the largest
crowd that ever visited Millett's Colma
resort. The fight fans who made the
journey were pleased with the Â«ondi
tion of the colored boxer. Jack wÂ»nt
through his work with his usual speed j
and skill. While boxing with "DenTer" j
Kd Martin the black fellow showed to
the best advantage. Johnson has a '
faculty of eluding punches at close
range that is truly marvelous. While
not appearing to break ground for his
adversary, he is as elusive as the pro
verbial shadow. Martin, who is some
thing of a speed marvel himself, could
hardly land a punch on Jack, while the
Texan seemed able to land on Martin
at will.
Johnson also boxed with Johnny
Roche, the clever little hundred-pound
er, and with "Texas" and Joe Sullivan.
He is an artist at blocking and hits iike
a piledriver. If he is as aggressive as
Hart promises to he, the fur will fiy
when they meet.
Hart also performed before a record
breaking crowd, and was roundly ap
plauded for his fast and clever work.

Oakland Office. San Francisco Call.
1016 Broariwav. Marr-h
The American Bankers' Association,
composed of Iks hanking houses of
the United States, has rakÂ«n a hand
in the hunt after the Stege Crossing
robbers who relieved John E. Dh!\
and Frank K. Roche of $10,000 last
Monday which was being taken from
the Central Bank to the Bank of
Richmond. The asso^ation which
has agencies in every large city of the
United States has directed all of its
forces upon the capture of the d%rir.<
highwaymen. To this end the
shrewdest detectives in the associa
tion's w vice have been put at work
to ferret out the criminals.
These detective* are under the di
rect control of the Plnkertons, and
cover the whole country in their ram
ifications. After nearly a week has
passed since the hold-up it has been
practically settled that the pair of
robbers have put many miles betw**'i
them and the scene. It is the theory
of the local authorities that if capture
shall be made it will be accomplished
at some point remote from Stege.
Much of the week has been spent
in work on descriptions. Roche arid
Daly have been questioned closely
and frequently on that point. Th<>
detectives have also gathered from,
every person available as detailed rÂ»
pÂ»rts of thÂ» suspects' appearance as
possible. The records at the disposal
of the police departments have been
scanned by experts for comparisons
with known criminals who might have
been concerned in the robbery. Thi3

MELLINS FOOD CO.. BOSTON. MAS*.OMAHA TO BE HAULED AWAY
FROM THE MUD BANKS.
117// Go to Old Anchorage
Russian Transport Lena Will Receive
Overhauling at Mare Island.
The Quarar.tine hulk Omaha,
w hich drifted on the mud banks north
of Point San Quentin during the gale
cf three weeks ag-o. will be towed
beck to her old moorings to-morrow.
The storm that dashed the vessel
&&ber was a fierce one. She parted
both her bow and stem anchors and
before any help could come to her
assistance she landed high and dry on
the mud flats. Surgeon H. S. Cum
riling, in charge of the quarantine sta
tion on Angel Island, at once had
divers put to work to try and find the
lost anchors and last week they were
located. The divers succeeded in ty
ing ropes to each end of the anchor
chains and the other ends of these
ropes were made fast to a floating
boom just over the spot where the
anchors lay.
The Omaha now lies deeply imbed
ded in soft, slushy mud. To-morrow
the transport tug Sloe urn will make
fast to her a.nd try to pull her away
from her present position and tow her
back to her old moorings. From the
position in which the Omaha lies the
Slocurn HI be compelled to do some
strong tugging before she hauls the
hulk into deep water.

LINER SINKS
AT HER DOCK
Parisian's Condition Shows
Plainly How Narrow Was
Escmpe of Her Passengers
LIBEL SUIT IS FILED
Vessel's Owners Blame the
Albauo for the Collision
Off the Halifax Harbor
HALIFAX. N. S., March 26.â The two
ocean steamships, the Parisian and the
Albano, whose. ISOO passengers were
saved from possible death at sea after
the collision between the two vessels
off the harbors mouth yesterday by
a thrilling flfteen-ir.ile race for shallow
water, showed plainly to-day how seri
ous the accident was, the Parisian rest
ing on bottom at her cock and the Al
bano's forepeak being full of water.
The Parisian, which came up the har
bor at 6 o'clock last night with a gap
ing hole on her starboard side from
the A'.bano's sharp bow, filled srradu
ally during the night and at dawn her
engine-room had been flooded, her fires
extinguished, her lower deck was awash
and htr keel rested in the mud. A larze
part of her cargo has been damaged by
water, but the bulk of the mail, con
sisting: of 400 sacks, was recovered in
a dry condition.
The statements of the two command
ers of the vessels as to the probable
cause of the collision are conflicting,
and the courts will be invoked to place
â lie responsibility. Proceedings have
begun in the Admiralty Court against
the Hamburg-American Company,
â  of the Albanq. and to-day that
Steamship was libeled for $150,000 dam
ages in behalf of J. and A. Aiian. own
ers of the Parisian.
Later it was announced that a
counter-suit would be brought by the|
GcnmÃ company.
ASKS THE CREW
TO RESCUE HAT
Sweet Young" Thing: Wants
a Lifeboat Launched to
Save Her Lost Millinery
The wind played wild pranks aJong;
the ocean beach yesterday. Number*
of hats were wrenched from the heads
of their owner? and started on a cruise
to China, by way of Honolulu.
One dainty young thing whose pic
ture hat went seaward with the breeze
showed that, despite her prettiness, she
had the gall of a sideshow elocutionist.
When she saw her milliner's crea
tion dancing over the billows toward
the South Seas she hurried to the life
saving station. She ran up to Coast
Guardsman Oleson. and, with tears in
her eyes, cried. "Please, Mr. Lifeboat
Man. get the boat quickly."
With visions of shipwrecks and
drowning women Oleson piped all
hands. The lifeboat crew was ready
to dash into the boiling surf, when
Captain Varney asked who was drown
ing.
"My new hat." replied the dainty
vision. brushing the wind-blown
masses of brown hair from hÂ«r eyes.
"Hurry, please!"
" Avast launching there!" thundered
Captain Varney. The lifeboat crew
began to stow away the boat.
"Aren't you going to save my hat?"
she asked, her eyes wide with won
der.
Captain Varney looked at the rag
ing surf. "I'm afraid that hat is
doomed to become a derelict," he re
plied.
The sweet young thing became in
dignant. "Well, what's your old life
boat for?" she said. "I know I can
never match that chiffon again any
where." And she left sobbing.
Said Coast Guardsman Oleson.
"Tumping Timminey, what a yoÂ«h."
HACK DRIVER SWALLOWS
FATAL AMOUNT OF POISOV
Francis William Smart, in a Fit of
Despondency Through Excessive
Drinking. Ends His Life.
Francla William Smart, a hack
driver, committed suicide yesterday
morning by swallowing a potion of
morphine. When his wife noticed his
condition she summoned Dr. James H.
Seymour, who telephoned for an am
bulance to take Smart to St. Luke's
Hospital. While being driven to the
hospital Smart expired in the ambu
lance in the presence of Dr. Seymour
and Mrs. Smart. The body was taken
to the Morgue, where Dr. L. D. Baci
galupl made an autopsy, after which
he sent the stomach to the City Chem
ist for an analysis of the contents.
Smart had been employed by E. C.
Christensen & Son, 1210 Valencia
street. He had been drinking heavily
for five months, which made him de
spondent. He (fed not turn up at his
home, 1710 San Jose avenue, on Sat
urday night. When his wife arose
yesterday morning she found a note
under the bedroom door written by
him. It said: '"Wife, you will find me
at Joost avenue. Remember me to
the children." He did not carry out
hts intention to go to Joost avenue,
but swallowed the poison in the
kitchen where his wife found him.

WILL DEFEND
HER $60,000,000!
Anna Weightman Walker
Defies Her Sister-in-Law
to Begin a Contest
BITTER FIGHT CERTAIN
Skeleton Will Be Dragged
From the Closet of the
Late 3lulti - 3lillionaire
Special Dlsi.a-.th ::> The Ca'.i.
PHILADELPHIA, March 26.â Mrs.
Anna Weightman Walker bids defi
ance to Mrs. Jones Wister. She not
only says positively that she will not
take one step toward settling the
threatened suit for Weightman's $60.
000,000, but also threatens to hit back
hard if any family scandal be re
vealed
Through a member of the family in
this city Mrs. Walker has sent this ul
timatum. Either the idea of opening
the case must be abandoned forthwvith
or cisc Mrs. Wtster will be met with
bitter reprisals.
There is to be an important confer
â . ence of legal representatives of each
side to-morrow- No one conversant
with the case believes for one moment
; that Mrs. Wister will pay any atten
: tion to Mrs. Walker's ultimatum, and
the first legal steps in the great fight
are expt-oted to be taken before the
â  closing of court to-morrow.
Despite all reports to the contrary,
' Mrs. Walker is in perfect health and is
aroused to a high pitch of anger
against Mrs. Wister. Mrs. Walker has
placed herself under the protection of
private detectives. Two of these men
attended her during her last visit to
this city and took turns In being con
â¢ stantly ti^ar her. One of her friends
has suggested that possibly Mrs.
Walker feared that the great atten
tion that has been attracted to her and
; her wealth might arouse some crank.
On the other hand the careful work
that has been done in preparing cvi
â  dence for the contest, it is pointed out,
; may have led Mrs. Walker to believe
; that she is being "shadowed," and
therefore she. has adopted the precau
â  tlon of a bodyguard to prevent the
i continuance of such a course.
One of the extremely interesting de
velopments in the case is the discov
ery vf a plan of Mrs. Walker's coun
sel to offset any evidence favorable to
Mrs. Wister's contest that may be
given by Edward J. Davis, former sec
retary for her father.

HOMESEEKERS
ARE IN DEMAND
Eesidents of San Bamon
Valley Want the Merits of
That Section to Be Known
HOLD MASS MEETINGS
Committee Is Appointed to
Secure Better Service From
the Eailroad Companies
ruWTT.T.K March 26. â A rousing
meeting of "Walnut Creek and San Ra
mon Valley citizens was held In the
Town Hall at Walnut Creek last night.
Enthusiasm was very marked and
many plans for the development of
the vaiiey were offered. The protests
against the railroad aervice, which
was a feature of the last meeting at
Danville, were made stronger at this
meeting. The present service was de
nounced in unmeasured terms. It was
declared that the failure to induce
horneseekers to locate in this section
of the State is due to the poor accom
modations afforded by the railroad
companies.
Charles Wood expressed the belief
that the railroad companies would be
quite ready to listen to duly ap
pointed representatives of the district.
At his suggestion a committee of three
was appointed to confer with the rail
road people. C. J. Wood, Mr. Stone
and Supervisor Harrison are the mem
bers of the committee.
Interest in the scheme to develop
the valley has spread so rapidly be
cause of this meeting that it has been
determined to take into the develop
ment organization several other towns.
In accordance with the decision a
meeting is to be held at Concord next
Saturday afternoon.

MARYSMLLE, March 28.â A new
pest has been discovered in the peach
orchards of Suiter County in the vi
cinity of Tuba City. Considerable
damage was done to the Mulr, Craw
ford and Foster varieties of the fruit

the stem of the leaves and causes
them to curl.
Horticultural Commissioner H. P.

TRADE STILL EXPANDING.
IF the bank clearings of the country are a good barometer of trade
conditions, as they are considered to be. then the expansion of
business this year over 1904 is extraordinary. Out of the first
fifty cities and towns on the list last week, forty-nine showed an in-
X over last year, and the only one on the adverse side was Cincin
â¢.vith the trifling decrease of 2.1 per cent. This is certainly a re
markable and encouraging exhibit, for these cities and tours are not
confined to a particular section, but are scattered ail over the coun
-rv. from one coast to the other, and from the Gulf of Mexico to the
t^anadian line.
The clearing* themselves were %2. 733.000.000. which is away above
what they have been up to this year, and some of the gains are ex
tremely large â those at New York being 65.9 per cent, at San Fr2n
}t.J per cent, at Boston 27.5 per cent, at Pittsburg 17.1 per
cent, and so on. As the clearings* are a cold-blooded exhibit of the
me of trade, there is no question of their accuracy as a com
:al barometer. In active times they are large: in dull times
run Â«mall : hence their value as a business indicator all over
the country. AÂ« they showed a gain last week of 45.6 per cent over
the same week last year, then general trade was just so much better
year than la-
Wall street, which follows these clearings as the tail does the
"eflect? them in a buoyancy and confidence which nothing
seems able to repress. All attempts to depress prices fail. In a
cay or so the market soars up again like a captive balloon. Experi
operators in the stock market, the barkers and individual
ake their heads dubiously and say that railroad and
shares are too high : that all of them are up to the dividend
limit, and not a few are over it. and that a reaction may be expected
shy day. Reaction* do occur, but they are merely transitory, and
\er a day. Money is so plentiful and the confidence
gettenl public in the future so confirmed that the market is
I buying orders all the time, and prices accordingly keep up.
The same buoyancy is noted in most of the staples. The Iron
-ays that recent large contracts for all sorts of iron and steel
products show the confidence of buyers and sellers in the market.
The locomotive works report large orders for engines, and the car
factories are hard at work turning out new cars to handle the im
-<â â  volume of freight tendered the railroads. The railroads therr.
felves report an increase of 7.9 per cent in earnings during the first
two week< of March over the same time last year.
But while all this iÂ« indicative of a large expansion* in domestic
trade, the foreign trade is not making an equally brilliant exhibit.
r% bankers are calling attention to the fact that the balance
-Hgn trade seems to be slowly working around against us. One
Â«Â«f the ablest of them has just pointed this out in a circular in which
"Our foreign trade shows a tendency â that of increasing im~
â¢ M - and decreasing exports â which will bear watching. \n Febru
ary our imports reached 5103.000.000. the highest on record, in
being a short month. Our exports were $109,000,000. or
about 56,000.000 in exces? of imports. " Compared with the same
these figures show an increase of Si 3.000.000 in
vnports and a decrease of over 59.000.000 in exports. The gain < f
- easily attributed to good business conditions here, whi'a
1 chiefly due to diminished shipments of wheat
and the lower price- of cotton. This tendency of imports to rise and
. if continued, must soon exert an important influence
international exchange?. During the twelve months enri
â¢'bruary 28 the excess of exports was only $357,000,000. the
amount of the 'a<i c ix years. Five years ago at this time
wt had an excess of exports j n the same twelve months aggregating
000.000. Unless this tendency ceases we must soon ship either
-lies or gold in settlement."
The different industrial lines continue to send in excellent re
tnitts fully employed and a continued brisk consrmptive dc-
T.ann for all manufactured articles. It was thought three or four
ag" that production was even then overtaking consumption.
but it has not apparently done so yet. Until that occurs times will
be lively: when that ur they will become quiet. As long
as the country is full of ready money the people will buy all sorts
of thing- and engage in all torts of enterprises: and as our huge
no -ign> of serious depletion there is hence
no immediate prospect of anything but continued activity in trade.
Or, in other words, a continuance of the present good times. Money
lally plentiful in Ftiropc. so we bave nothing to fear from that
quarter at present. Thus, with the financial skies so rosy all over
the world, the time for the emergence of the croaker from his hole
h not vet at hand.
INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION.
AN organization recent 1 } started in Boston desires the Massa
chusetts Legislature to appoint a commission to study the
question of industrial education, to gather valuable information
â¢n American and foreign source-, and inquire into present anÂ«!
re conditions in their own State. Massachusetts i< moved to thi
by the consideration that =he i<= handicapped by deficiencies
natural resources and geographical position, and that she must
ike up for them by superiority of knowledge and skill. So her
pie reason that the most profitable investment they can make
in this new century will be what they put into schools.
-â ! Massachusetts could by the proposed plan of helping her
\ also greatly help our whole country, is evidenced by the report
?ch the German educational experts who studied the St. Louis
-'nation madr fo their Government. They represented that Ger
-nar.y ne^(i have no fear of future competition of American" manufac
rtd jroods. to long: as the Fatherland stuck to the educational
method* which are now in practice. * They believe that thorough
technical training and education in right commercial methods wi!l
enable Germany to maintain ft lead over America's unschooled en
et in trade and manufacture.
The argument is made that Massachusetts holds a position in
relation to the whole T'nited States analogous, in an economic sens'*.
hat which England ha^ to the rest of the world. Thus that State
old become a renter of manufacturing and general technical skill
which would give a reason for existence and a success in Competition

THE PUBLIC HEALTH.
WHILE the hospitals in Eastern cities are so crowded with
typhoid, cerehro-spinal fever and. diphtheria patients that thf*
sufferer? are compelled to lie on the floor, it i? of interest io
compare California conditions. The report of the State Board of
Health Â«hows that in the whole State, in the month of February,
â¢here were only 19 deaths by spinal fever. 13 by typhoid and 12 by
iiphtheria. In our population of near 2.000,000 there were only no
deaths from pneumonia. In an equal population in the East that
'ireadfnl epidemic kilN many in a day. During the whole month
there was no epidemic of any kind in any part of the State. But
this is not exceptional at all. Epidemics and acute diseases are prac
tically unknown at any tone of year in California.
The highest death list of February was 210 by consumption. The
ti^ures are a pitiful evidence of the faith of Eastern sufferers from
hat disease that our climate can cure at any stage. Most of the
deaths in that list were'of Eastern people who had waited too long
and then expected deliverance by miracle. Consumption was not art
indigenous disease of California, but it has been imported here as it
hae been in Colorado. Still it takes hold of Californians slowly, and
its ravages are among Eastern people who bring the disease with
them too late to get any good effect from our outdoor climate.

THE MYSTERY OF
UNTOUCHED JOY
Things You Want and Cannot Have Are Imag-
inatively Yours Forever.
DOROTHY FENIMORE
x~"V NE Jane a rose grew outside my window Just beyond my reach. It
ONE June rose grew outside crinkly petal; quite an ordinary rose
'was a little rose, pink and crinkly of petal; quite an ordinary rose
V / maybe but because It crew beyond my reach It seemed prettier
than other roses. Thus it came about that the little Tome, like an
the other thin** which I would have liked to have, but could not. became oar-.
of me and I hold it close forever. \ â¢ *,_ " .
â¢c most desire that thing we cannot have. It matter, not that other
things which are quite as fair are ours. Our souls are ever reaching out to
ward the mystery of some untouched^
joy. Our senses sigh for the fragrance
of the rose beyond our reach. The
beauty which we cannot irraaD looks |
etarlike to our longing gaze. The love ,
that was not meant for us entices
often .with Circean spell.
What use all this? Why j/ire we
baffled so? Why cant we lave the
things we want? Why should we want :
the things we can not have? Why
must thtre always be some pathos in ;
our pleasure? And why is every pang ;
of pain as full of wonder as if it were j
a throb of joy? I do not know. Do j
you? I think not.
There's nothing, then, for you and
me except to make the best of thintrs.
Shall we be nothing more than chil
dren of a larger growth, throwing
aside the treasures that we have, to
cry because we can not hold between
our hands the shining moon? Shall
we in folly waste good tears â which
some day we may need to make our
spirits grow â by letting them fall,
blistering, upon our window-sill. thÂ« :
while we gaze through misty woe upon
that pretty little rose which we de
sire chiefly because it grows beyond
our reach.
There i.~ this to remember: The
things you want and can not have are
imaginatively yours forever. They are
part of your ideal of life, part of your
hope, part or your ambition They
will never become common; they will
never be superfluous. The princess
whom th* page adores is always a.
princess ia his thoughts. The knight
whose dignity impressed the simple village girl, and touched her heart, as
he rode by her cottage door in all the splendor >>t his gleaming armor, could
never walk across her maiden fancy like an ordinary man. In her dreams
he would always be. inevitably, a noble knight on his way toward tbÂ« tooljr
wars. '
And so it is with you who love some one whom fate has put beyond
your reach. The one you love is yours in such a way that nothins can take
her from you. She is your inspiration. She gives a Joy to you to-day
still will be a joy to-morrow. For in your memory she will remain oveen
of all the roses. If you could Dluck her from hÂ«r lovely throne, she misht
l>e just like other roses â who knows? And as her petals drooped and fell
beneath the c!o?e warmth of your clasping finger?, you misht reyret. rÂ«

"Not bo's I could notice it," replied

Ttw â¢lection <3s.i* are corn*, tb# maddest of
the year.
Of anxious raiiuls and eaÂ«w pleaÂ« for ballots
ctral^ht and clear.
From all clubdom are the fumes of
politics rising, as the redolent vapors
curl upward from the Ã¼biquitous tea
cup.
From out of the North comes a tale
of belated suppers, a bunch of head
aches and a Russo-Japanese engage
ment. Another such tale comes from
out of the South but that's not a mat
t*r to shock the "'highly respectable"
m said points of th* compass. It's a
mark of progress. It shows that
Â« men arc awakening to activities that
will eventually fit them to bear their
chare of civic duties. So, don't you
care, ladies!
Until thÂ« last decade women â speak
in** collectivelyâ were children in mat
ters of initiative, accepting unquestion
:r.g!y the theory that "All that ie. is
right" â Just because It Is. and Man
said so. * '
.Now, while it is lamentably true that |
a great deal of energy is wasted by
clubwomen in useless discussions, that I
very waste Is a symptom of progress,
for thus it is that they are learning.
Women are growing less verbose upon
the floor (good news! say the men. hop
ing the habit may spread to the home).
more discriminate in the choice of
words and less Habit to fly off at a
tangent than when clubs were less a
part of the lives of women.
This fact was the dominant note at
i_e . late State Federation at Los An
geles, hen the least observant amone
v* discovered the women more definite
âin reason and In languageâ better
poised and altogether more rational be
ings than at any previous State rather
ing, and tbe personnel was very nearly
the m.. c as in former gatherings.
To be sure. Mrs. George Law Smith,
â¢who presided over the convention as
Ftate president, was a powerful factor
in this attainment of directness, but it
was plain that the women's minds were
better disciplined than in the earlier
years of clubdom. And this was a thine
of pride.
Thus let not a few cold suppers and
a fevr hot headaches form the text for
tfcÂ«? abolition of clubs-Mhese are just
little indices of progress.
But anent elections and the agitation
thereabouts, bitter partisanship Is to
be deplored.
If a club be blessed with a conscien
tious and Intelligent president for one
year, it is a wise thing and a courteous
thing to tender her the office for a sec
onfl termâ but no third term, since third
terms are tabooed by the unwritten po
litical and ethical codes of our country,
and are opposed to the best interests of
most organizations.
When the nominations are made care
should be taken to name only such wo
men as are personally equipped to fill
the offices in question; It is essential
that it be not merely a matter of
friendship. And here is the greatest
fatality to the progress of clubsâ this
mixing up of friendship and unfltness.
So. clubwomen, now that the time
draws near when we shall be called
upon to decide the awful matters of
club administration, let us select wo
men of brain, balance and tact â rather
than the women who give 'such lovely
teas and wear such dreams of gowns
and own real Russian samovars" â as
an earnest advocate once announced in
support of her candidate.

WOMAN'S DIAMONDS HAVE
SUDDENLY DISAPPEARED
Mr*. YVhlteman of Port Chester Ask*
Police to Help Her Find-
Missing Jewelry.
Mr?. A. V. "Whiteman of Port Ches
ter, N. T., who is staying at the Pal
ace Hotel, has reported to the police
the low of a diamond studded dagger,
and. a jeweled scarf pin, which she
values at about $200. With her
daughter and J. McClenahan. a bank
er of Port Chester, and his wife, Mrs.
Whiteman arrived at the Palace on
March 23 and. according to. her state
ment made to the police, when she
prepared to adorn herself with her
jewelÂ« that evening for dinner she dis
covered that the articles mentioned
had been removed from a small case
in her traveling satchel^BSÃSÃ
The McClenahan party came to
this city direct from Del Monte and
Mrs. Whiteman admitted yesterday
to Detective Matheson that she had
not seen, the jewelry after leaving her
former stopping place, supposing that
they were safely locked in her jewel
case. It is the belief of the detective,
however, -that some one stole the pins
before Mrs. Whiteman left Del Monte.
Swindled by Rmployment Ajr^nt.
James Shverko and Matthew Medi
ca, laborers, complained to Policeman
Bakulich yesterday that they had
been swindled out of $30 each by an

to deposit * $30 each ; : as ;a ; guarantee.
They gave him the coin and he hand
ed them â¢ $10 Confederate note. '-:'-. He
instructed them! to go ; to 9 Post street,
but when) they went there they were
told they ,\ were not wanted. They : did
not know .the â Italian's : name. but.
thourh they were strangers in: the* city
they thought; they might be able to
find" his ; office. Bakulich will go on a
search with. them to-day.

HEBREWS AID
THEIR POOR
Board of Relief Reports on
Charities Bestowed During
the Last Twelve Months
ANNUAL ELECTION HELD
Officers Are Installed and
Recommendations of Pres
ident and Secretary Kead
The good work of the Hebrew Board
of Relief of San Francisco was the sub
ject of an extended address .to the offi
cers and directors of that organization
at its meeting yesterday morning: at
436 O'Farrell street. Besides the presi
dent's and secretary's reports showing
the financial condition of the; institu
tion, the annual election of officers as
held and plans for the establishment
of an educational farm were discussed.
I. The board of relief is composed of 1
four large constituent societies, the I
Eureka Benevolent Association, the
First Hebrew Benevolent Society, Jew- ,
ish Ladies', Relief Society and the La- '
dies' United Hebrew Benevolent So- j
ciety. These represent the strongest
Hebrew aid societies in California, and
their work, through " the board of re- 1
lief, , during the last fiscal year - ending
; March 25, has been immeasurable for,
good.
The annual election resulted in the
placing of Henry Sinshefmer In "he of- !
flee of ' president, succeeding Charles .
Hirsch, who has held the office for four
years. James M. Ellis was re-elected I
vice-president, Albert ' Meyer, treasurer,
and Meyer H. Levy, secretary. The
board of , directors consists of S. W.
Heller, Simon Newman, Simon Ans
pacher. Otto Irving Wise. Ellas Strun- .
sky. Mrs. Henry Wagenheim. Mrs. P.
N. Aronson, Mrs. Louis Goodman and ,
Mrs. H. Davidson.
The report of the president shows
that the . disbursements of the society i
in the aid. of charity were the largest !
that have been made by the board since
its beginning. This is accounted for*by
the growing population of the city and
the arrival of semi-destitute families
that are compelled ,to seek aid. Out ;
of 602 cases 481 were applicants who !
have been, residents of San Francisco
for less than six months. The report i
speaks of the difficulty of relief work j
owing to the fact that almost all who;
apply are factory workers, while this
is not a manufacturing community.
â  â¢ The secretary's figures show that the '
board received 5064 applications for as
sistance, representing 937 cases, of these
602 being new applications. In the {
treatment of these cases and the few- :
recurrent ones, the wisdom of com- !
bining the four societies has been fully
demonstrated. The. expenditures for i
relief work amounted to $36,054 70. The
president's report shows the receipts
to be $37,811 05.
In speaking of the work of the board \
the report says:
While striving to repress pauperism and !
check imsoeltlon,-' we hÂ«.ve endeavored to i
ameliorate the suffering and better, the condi- !
tions lof our poor and to make once dependent i
families self-supporting instead of teaching!
them to resort to the public as the perennial I
rr>eanÂ« of existence. That we hare worked I
with good results hag been principally due to
the co-operation afforded by the ladies. repre- â¢
seated on your board. The modern way of do
iÃti â .: \rity requires . investigation and reinvw- |

s * . "â "^ sick sisters, and
above- all, a woman who has had
more experience in treating female ilia
than any lining 1 person.
Orer one hundred thousand cases of
female diseases come before Mrs. Pink-
ham every year, some personally,
'"â  others by mail, and this has been |jo-
; in? on for twenty years, day after day.
Surely women are wise in seeking
j advice from a woman of such experi-
e nce, especially when it is absolutely
free.
Mrs. Pinkham never violates thÂ© con-
fidence of women, and every testimo-
nial letter published is done so with
; the written consent or request of thÂ»
writer, in order that other sick women
may be benefited as they have been.
Mrs. Fred Seydel. of "413 North Mth
Street, West Philadelphia, Pa., writes:
Dear Mrs. Pinkham:â
1 "Over a year ago I wrote a letter asking
advice, as I had female ills and could not
carry a child to maturity. I received your
kind letter of instructions and followed your
advice. lam not only a well woman in con-
sequence. but have a beautiful baby cirL I
wish every suffering woman in the land would
write you for advice, as you have done so
much for me."
| Just as surely as Mrs. Seyde! was
cured, will Lydia E. Pinkham'a
â  Vegetable Compound cure every
woman suffering 1 from any form of
female ills.
No other medicine in all the world
has such a record of cures of female
troubles a3 has Lydia E. Pinkham's
j Vegetable Compound. Therefore no
prudent woman will accept any substi-
tute which a druggist may offer.
If you are sick, write Mrs. Pinkham,
Lynn. Mass . for special advice. It U
free and always helpful.

FINDS RICHES
IN THE MINES
31iss Mollie O'Bryan, Once
a Stenographer, Now a
Gold Queen of Colorado
WEALTH COMES QUICKLY
Fortunate Investment in
Stocks Ten Years Ago
Turns Into a Cool Million
6peclal Dispatch to Tha Call
CRIPPLE CREEK, Colo., March 26.
From stenogrrapher to a millionairess
is the romantic transition accom
plished during ten years of the life
of Miss Mollie O'Bryan of Cripple
Creek. Miss O'Bryan lived in Lake
City, Colo., ten years ago. While per
fecting herself in stenography she re
ceived a letter from a friend, urging
her to come to this place, where high
prices were paid for competent work.
She accepted the invitation. Quick
of perception and eager to learn, she
absorbed the rudiments of mining
usage that have become invaluable to
her since as a n^ining operator on her
own account.
She bought stocks. They advanced
in value. In a short time her bank
account was sufficiently large to buy
property.
Then came the organization of stock
companies. One of her ventures was
the Teutonic. She was made presi
dent. It was well located. At the
present valuation her interests in this
mine alone are worth nearly a quar
ter of a million dollars.
Miss O'Bryan also is president of
the Gold Bond Syndicate Consolidated
Company, with property on Gold Hill.
She is president of the Amalgamated
Gold Mining Company, owning 120
acres on Battle Mountain, the home
of the Gold Coin. AJax, Portland and
Independence mines, as well as prop
erty on Globe and other hills within
the gold belt. In addition to her in
terests in the Cripple Creek district
Miss O'Bryan is extensively interested
in California and Nevada. She is
secretary and treasurer of the Vir
ginia Gold Mining Company of Gold
field and treasurer of the Goldfleld
United Mine Company and one of its
largest stockholders.
Miss O'Bryan is an interesting per
sonality. She is pretty and scarcely
shows her 30 years. Miss O'Bryan
has received many proposals of mar
riage, but she apparently has no
thought of changing- her name.

FIRST SHOOT OF SERIES
GOES TO UNION GUN CLUB
Defeats the Empire Club by Eight
Points In Challenge Match
at Bluerocks.
The first of the series of three chal
lenge matches between tfcams of the
Union Gun Club and of the Empire
Gun Club went to the former yester
day at Ingleside after a close contest.
Out of 360 bluerocks the Union Club
members broke 263 tarsrets, against a
score of 254 breaks made by their
competitors.
A strong piercing wind blew over
the traps and made shooting difficult.
Many of the crack shots fell far be
low their true form, probably due to
the heavy wind. Each club was rep
resented by eighteen members, who
shot at twenty targets from the six
teen-yard mark. Holling and Iverson
did the best work for the Union Club,
breaking twenty and nineteen respec
tively. Webb was high gun for the
Empire Club, breaking eighteeh. The
next match will take place the second
Sunday in April.
The Union Gun Club held its regular
shoot previous to the challenge match.
Iverson, who was shooting tn good
form during the day, took the honors
and the medal from the "champs."
Daniels beat the rest of his team mates
in the first class match. He also shot
well in the challenge event, scoring
nineteen breaks *for his club. A medal
was pinned on Janssen's breast for do-
Ing the best shooting in clas? two.
Dutton shot like a champion in the
third class and easily annexed the
honors and the medal. Following are
the results:

GAME IS DECIDED BEFORE
UNCLE'S MEN WARM UP
Joe Corbett's Wing
Is Slow to Re
spond
displays Help Big
Leaguers Pile
Up Runs.
Chicago's diamond artists will make
their getaway with the satisfaction
that the best San Francisco has could
nqt take a series from them. They did
enough work in the first period of yes
terday's game to allow them to walk
on velvet for eight rounds, while the
Seals never once hotfooted over the
sacks. Score! Chicago 4, San Francis
co v.
c Another laic of a taut start remains
to b,e told. It wajs Brother Joe Cor-
â¢ c bett who fell by the wayside this time.
He' dia even worse than Mr. Miller
Â«>v?r imagined he could do. That first
spasm took, ail the ginger out of
Hank's piayers and also robbed the
tans of their power to root for the
hy.-nt.teun when things began to look
good.
Barring the first inning, the game
ctmtainea 'any amount of snappy base
bs.ll Corbett settled down and pitched
in hi* Baltimore form after he suc
ceeded in ridding himself of the wig
gles at the outset. Chicago managed
to rase a mas to the pan in the third,
jbaEt ntver again did the stars from the
Windy town have & chance to gather
in any â  runs.
Casey ushered in the panicky first by
pai taking of a base on bails. Maioney
.:â  r . J a bunt at the plate and
Brother Joe threw it away at first,
i suing Casev retch third. Then
Chance dropped a squirmer which Cap
tain Wilson forgot to throw correctly
tÂ« Nealon. . Both Casey and Maloaey
carre home. ' Schuite got a -'life on- Cor
betts next misplay. Chance .stole third
and togrether with Schuite he pulled off
a double steal, making it three runs
for the Inning.
The net â  spasm passed without inci
dent, but in the third the big leaguers
a cain began to negotiate for a run. A
hit. a steal and another misplay al
lowed Schuite to make his way over
the paths ar.d reach home in safety-
After that time Chicago's aggressive
ness availed them nothing, for Cor
b^tt's vring was working right again.
About 5000 fans were there in spite
of c the wind and the cold. They were
all pretty* much disgusted and dis
heartened when the Seals got away
â wrong in the opening period. Several
times their hopes of runs were dashed
â when the CWcago infield" pulled off
clever dotsbleTplays on chances that
looked nigh impossible to handle. The

MEET DEFEAT
Clever Tennis Team Loses
Its' First Match on the
Golden Gate Park Courts
The qualifying rounds for the in
door tennis tournaments to.be held in
; connection with the Forest, Fish and
I Game show wen? completed yesterday
J on the outdoor courts at Golden Gate
Park. in the single* three of the
four semi-final places went jCuli
fornia Club" men. while the fourti
won by Clarence Griffin of the Golden
Gate Tennis Club. In doubles, each,
i club will -have two. representatives. \
The four successful players in sin
gles were Carl Gardner, George Janes,
Clarence- Griffin and either Harry
j Roife or Herbert Schmidt. The last
named players are both from the Cali
fornia Club and will probably
early in the" week on the club -courts
or at Berkeley. "Gardner will be op
posed to either Schmidt or Rolfe at
the Pavilion while Janes will meet
Grf ; -.. If the affair had been pre
arranged, more evenly matched play
ers could not have been brought to
gether. While they do not belong to
the championship class, they are all
clever young players and among ,the
. best in the first class.
The four v remaining teams in
doubles are Herbert Schmidt and Har
i ry Rolfe, George Janes and Herbert
Long of the California . Club, and
Charles Foley and Charles Dunlap. E.
i P. Finnegan and J. R. Lewis of the
! Golden Gate Club. Rolfe and
Schmidt will be opposed to Long and
Janes, while Foley and Dunlap -will
have Lewis and Finnegan for oppon
ents.
Many spectators were on hand to
witness the matches and they, were
treated to some good tennis.
The Baker brothers suffered their
j first defeat on the park courts. Long
and Janes had the distinction of beat
! ing the public court champions. The
â winners have been successful of late
i and "have only been â¢ beaten once in a
i tournament since ' they joined forces.
Most of the credit of the victory be
long* to Janes, who did some remark
ably good playing. -
After the first set- it seemed the
: 'Baker brothers would win easily.
i They lobbed to perfection throughout
! the- set and Long and Janes could
i make but little headway. In the sec
â¢ ond set they broke up the steady safe
j game of the Bakers arid the lobs they
I missed so : frequently in the opening
set they killed time and time again.
The third set was a repetition of the
second and went to Long and Janes.
The score was 2-6. Â«-Â». 6-4.
In the. lower half Dunlap and Foley
had an , easy.: time reaching the semi
finals. They won their 'â¢- matches as
i they pleased. Lewis and Finnegan
also had " r an easy " time.", Code and
Norton made, a good stand against
them, but lost in straight sets. ' i
i In singles Carl Gardner beat Neil
| Baker and J. A." Code in the order |
named. . Janes likewise : had an easy j
time, beating both Kuehn and Hotch

Which has the better ball : teamâ
the men who battle against flame and
smoke or the , men who battle against
crooks -and highbinders That is a
question^ which may be answered some
other time. ' When nine innings had
been reeled, oft* at Recreation Park yes
terday morning the policemen were
there with five runs, but the firemen
had them tied, so they shook mitts
and promised to meet again and bat
tie once more.
Anyhow, it. was. a great game and a
crowd of 000 people went to Bee : it.
There was more noise about Eighth
street than was ever made by a home
coming picnic brigade.- The honors
for the "noise'stunt are also declared
a draw, for the whistles and. bells that
were brought into action raised a din
that will hold the South Side residents
for a while. â¢ â ';!â '>; ';: :
For three rounds the rival r played
shutout ball on ,both' sides. Then the
firemen broke -in with" a run "and the
coppers just to show their gameness
came right Back J with one. The ex
citement Was -'so dense that Chief
Sullivan ; and Michael Joseph Conboy
forgot to look saucy. at one another.
Along came the coppers with four in
the fourth. r'Bing! ' they landed on the
shoots of "Keg" O'Connor^ and the
merry procession only came to a halt
when four men had : done the circuit.
The police rooters â  were the proudest
things In the lot for about two .nnings.
Then the firemen cleared the : smoke
away and began to chop at the debris
till it was a deadlock.'; \ "v : 'â '-
Poor old -: Murphy, who played sec
ond base ; for the coppers,- got ; into â  a
delirium ;of doubt when : the sacks
were filled in the sixth. A hot one was
hit |to him and \he had so â¢ many places
to throw the ball he really .forgot: He
rang in for the | reserve squad, but it
was too slow to respond. > Finally Mur
phy tossed the ball to the plate. : The
toss was r wild ;â¢ and *it -; let i two i' of f the

CARTOONIST IS HIRED
BY BATTLING NELSON
Artist Is to Make Satirical Pictures on
Britt at His Suggestion
FIRST PRODUCTION BY the cartoonist WHOM BATTLING ! nelson has I ,
. EMPLOYED TO TURN OUT SATIRICAL PICTURES WHICH THE FIGHTTNO. ::b '
| DANE EVOLVES IX THE HOPE OF DRAWING BRITT rNTO- A MATCH. .-" -f , '
This is a cartoon.
The brain of Battling Nelson con
cocted it
The work, was executed under the
personal direction of the Dane. It is
Ms ftret offense, but It will not be his
last, as he has a salaried cartoonist
on his staff who turns them out to or
der whenever Battling gets an inspira
ticJ^r indigestion.
Xeison has made up his mind that
if he rant land on J. Edward Britta
solar plexus that he will Jar his feel
ings with short-arm jabs in the foitn
of high art. It is Bat's Intention to
fresco fences far and wide with pic
tures that. do not flatter Britt.
He and Manager Nolan are seriously
contemplating renting one side of
Twin Peaks as a site for the display
of a cartoon of this sort. In a few days
when James Chesterfield Britt saun
ters along the boulevard he will see
distorted oictures of his classic pro
file where the soap ads used to be-
Rumor has it that the Britts will re
tort through the phonograph agencies.
The fertile brain of Willis is said to
have evolved the idea.
The scheme is to have a big phono
graph in front of all the- penny
agonies which will repeat unkind re
mark? about the Dane. Here is one
of the spasms the moanograph will
turn out. Willis concocted it:
â¢There is a canned lobster named
Bat.
You never know just where he's at.
He's a false alarm bluff.
And a peddler of guff,
And he talks through a hole in his
hat.'
Nelson's notion is to bring about a
real battle. He says he doesn't like the
diplomatic and repartee game. He
wants James Edward within reaching
di3tance. Nor will he consent to the
dispute being settled by the Interna
tional Peace Conference.
â¢fm gotng to keep after him wher
ever he goes." says Bat. The Dane de
clares that the next time J. Edward
treads the monologue boards he will
be there in a box. A basket of Peta
luma eggsâ retired onesâ will probably
b*> in the viclnitv. for Bat declares he
will egg Britt on He may take the
notion into his h*ad to do It literally.
"Be-lud" is what the Dane wants and
he wants it quick.
The rate at which the Zulus can run
in an emergency is astonishing. Some
will cover as much as fifty miles in
six hours. Eight miles an hour Is
common.

Arthur Peabody, the Chicago horse

of the management of the St. Francis
Hotel, by whom he was charted with
having passed bad checks, will not be
brought back to San Francisco. It
was announced yesterday that Pea

buquerque pending the arrival of a
warrant, had made good the amount
of the checks passed at the hotel and
that the management of the St. Fran
cis had decided not to prosecute him.
Peabody cashed several checks at
the St. Francis, one of which he gave
in payment for his bill the night be
fore he left town. Another he cashed
â¢with the auditing department and it
was upon the latter check, which was
declared to be bad by a New York
trust company, that his apprehension
at Albuquerque was effected. Since
hi 6 arrest the hotel management has
learned that the check he gave in pay
ment for his bill had been honored
in the East.

THE SAX FRAXCrSCO CALL. MONDAY, MARCH 27. 1905
NEW WITNESSES
MIKE CHARGES
Grand Jury .Has Busy Days
Before It and More Indict
ments Are Likely to Result
MAY MEET TO-MORROW
Foreman Andrews Says Bills
Against Two Other Offi
cials May Be Returned
The lull that has fallen upon the ac
tivities of the Grand Jury may be brok
en before the regular meeting of that
body next Friday. Foreman Andrews
may call a special meeting any day be
fore then. There are some important
matters that the jurors will be called
upon to consider very soon, and it may
be deemed advisable to get at them
without delay. Some sensations are
promised. It is said that two city offi
cials in high place will be on the rack
before the week closes, and that wit
nesses have come forward with tales
that may result in their indictment.
These witnesses, it is alleged, are ready 1
to testify to facts that are highly in
criminating. The lull has not abated
the excitement that exists around the
City Hall, and the holders of official
positions are awaiting with great curi- j
osity the next act on the part of the
Inquisitorial body that has been stir- I
ring up officialdom.
The recent bereavement in the family
of Foreman Andrews has prevented him
taking any active part in matters re- :
lating to the work of the Grand Jury
for several days, but a consultation
between him and District Attorney By
ington is scheduled for to-morrow, and
it will be determined by them whether
proceedings shall be begun in connec
tion with certain lines of information
that has been given. It is quite likely
that a meeting of the Grand Jury will
be called for Tuesday, if the District
Attorney deems that this information
Is sufficient, without further evidence,
to warrant indictments.
TWO MORE OFFICIALS CHARGED.
Intimations are made that Mayor
Schmitz himself will be investigated
during the next few days, the report
on the lax bookkeeping methods in
vogue in his office not beinsr the end
of the Grand Jury's work concerning
him. The Mayor is still in town and is
stiH wearing his pleasant smile and
taking his regular rest at nieht.
Neither is the Inquisitorial body done
with the ballot-box stuffing investiga
tion, and will probe further into that.
Foreman Andrews admitted yester
day the truth of the story that two of
ficials in high place were to have their
characters dangled before the eyes of
the Grand Jury this week, and he said
that the returning of indictments
against them was expected.
"The names of these two men have
not yet been mentioned in connection
with any wrongdoing that has been
under consideration by us," he said.
"We have some witnesses who are
ready to swear to facts that will prob
ably be sufficient -to indict them. No
persons connected with these investiga
tions but myself and District Attorney
Byington are in possession of the state
ments of these witnesses. We are pur
posely keeping them from the knowl
edge of the other members of the
Grand Jury until the witnesses are
summoned, as we do not want the point
to be raised, after Fndictments are
found, that the members were preju
diced when they voted to return them.
We lost five votes on the Maestretti in
dictments because of a fear that this
point would be raised against the five
who refrained from voting.
SPECIAL MEETING PROBABLE.
"We are not through with Mayor
Schmitz, and we will continue the in
vestigation of the stuffers. Are we
after the Mayor with an idea of finding
an indictment against him on some
particular charge? Well, that's put
ting it pretty strong. Future investi
gations will concern him, though. lam
going to hold a consultation with Dis
trict Attorney Byington to-morrow and
may call a meeting of the Grand Jury
the following day, or perhaps Wednes
day. Whether I do or not will be de
' cided by the conclusion we reach at
I this consultation.
"The poolselling evil is to receive fur
ther and full investigation. We will
carry on a searching inquiry in regard
to that evil with a view to learning
who is responsible for it and bringing
the guilty ones to justice, if possible.
There are busy times ahead for the
Grand Jury. It's work is far from fin
ished."
FOOTPADS
HAVE BUSY
NIGHT OUT
Four Armed and Masked
Men Enter Establishment
of John Hartman, Tap Till
and Hhoot at Proprietor
LIKE BOLD CRIMES
ABOUND IX THE CITY
E. F. Ruffles Is Held Up for
Watch on Howard Street.
While Peter Johnson's Rob
ber Is First Introduced
Footpads had another outing; last
night and jjot away.
John Haitnum's saloon at 516 Sec
ond street was robbed by four high
waymen, who got $45.
E. F. Ruffles, a furniture dealer at
915 Mission street, was relieved of a
$30 watch and chain as he was walk
ing along Howard street.
Peter Johnson was held up for a
$65 watch by a man to whom lie had
just been introduced.
Four armed and masked robbers
entered the saloon and grocery of John
Hartman at 516 Second street last night
and, at the points of revolvers, com
pelled the proprietor to surrender $45
which was in the cash register. At
first Hartman refused, and a shot was
fired at him. It is believed the cart
ridge was a blank, as no trace of a
bullet can be found. Two patrons of
the place were obliged to raise their
hands, but were not further molested.
Hartman fired four shots at the thieves
after they had left the place.
Hartman, John Brown of 516 Second
street and J. J. McGovern of 523 Sec
ond street were in the saloon portion
of the establishment when four men
came along. One of the criminals took
up his position just outside the front
door and the other three, whose faces
were concealed by handkerchiefs, en
tered with drawn revolvers. Each one
of the trio picked out a man and or
dered him to throw up his hands. Brown
and McGovern quickly complied when
the muzzles of the weapons were shov
ed under their noses, but Hartman re
fused to comply with the demand.
FIRES AT VICTIM.
With an oath the robber who had him
I in charge retreated a step and fired
pofnt blank at the saloonman's body.
Hartman then changed his mmd and
his hands went high at>ove his head.
The next command the robbers made
I was for the three men to march to a
' room in the rear of the place.
When they did so two of the thieves re
mained guard over them, while a third
walked behind the bar and attempted
to open the cash register. The cash
box, however, was locked and the
masked man made preparations to
break it open. Hartman begged him
not to do so and offered to open the ma
chine rather than have it broken.
Still with his hands above his head,
j Hartman was marched behind the bar
and turned over $45 in cash. He was
asked If that was all the money in the
; place and he replied that it was. Wlth
j out further parley the three men turn
\ ed and stepped out of a side door that
; leads into an alley. They were quickly
; joined by the man who had acted as
[ guard and the four rushed away to-
I gether in the direction of South Park.
\ Hartman got his revolver and fired
; after the fleeing figures. He did no
damage.
Detectives Dinan and Wren were de
! tailed on the case and came to the con
clusion that the robbers were well ac
| quainted with the place and the neigh
i borhood. They were all apparently
I young, and it is possible that arrests
j will be made very soon.
FURNITURE MAN ROBBED.
A daring robbery was committed
last night shortly after 8 o'clock when
five men held up E- F. Ruffles, a fur
niture dealer at 915 Mission street.
j Ruffles had no money, but one of the
' thugs got his watch and chain, valued
' at $30. â¢
Ruffles was walking along Howard
j street, and when he reached the cor
j ncr of Russ street five men sprang out
jof a doorway. They jumped him so
j quickly that he did not even have a
chance to make an outcry. After get
ting his watch and chain, the thugs
quickly dispersed, first warning Ruffles
not to make a noise, under pain of
death.
Ruffles reported the hold-up to the
police at the Southern Station. He was
so badly frightened that he was un
able to give the police a description of
any of his assailants.
AN INGENIOUS HOLD-UP.
Peter Johnson, 36 Langdon street,
was the victim of a bold "stick up"
man last night at Sixth and Natoma
streets. He walked out of a saloon
there with a stranger and as soon as
they got around the corner, Johnson's
supposed friend held him up and re
lieved him of $6 in cash and a gold
watch and chain valued at $65.
Johnson was in the saloon kept by
Mrs. Sullivan on Natoma street be
tween Third and Fourth. There he
met Jerry Sullivan, husband of the
proprietress. The two men went up
to the saloon at Sixth and Natoma
streets, where Sullivan introduced
Johnson to the man who robbed him.
Sullivan took his departure as soon
as the formality of the introduction
had been gone through. A moment
later the hold up man invited Johnson
to take a walk with him. They had
gone but a short distance from the
place when Johnson's supposed friend
ordered his man to throw up his
hands, after which he quickly ran
sacked the latter's pockets and got
away. Johnson told the officials at
the Southern police station his

LIFE CRUSHED
OUT BY CARS
E. H. Moore, Switchman
of Southern Pacific Com
pany, Falls Under Wheels
DEATH INSTANTANEOUS
This Is Second Similar Fa
tality in the Same Family
Within Last Six Months
Edward H. Moore, a switchman, was
killed instantly in the Southern Pacific
Company's yards, Fourth and Town
send streets, five minutes before 7
o'clock yesterday morning. He would
have reported off duty at 7 o'clock.
An engine was backing up a number
of oil cars, and Moore was on the front
car. While trying to set a coupling his'
foot slipped and he fell, the wheels
passing over his body and causing in
stant death. The engine was promptly
stopped and the body dragged from
underneath the car. The Morgue was
notified and Deputy Coroner Fennell ;
took charge of the body. Moore was a
married man, 26 years of age. ajid lived
at 1123 Guerrero street. Patrick A.
Hearte, the engineer, was arrested by
Policemen Tyrrell and Ryan and
booked at the City Prison on a charge j
of manslaughter. He was released on â¢
550 cash bail.
This is the second fatality in the
Moore family within the last six
months. William C. Moore, an elder
brother of Edward, who was also em- j
ployed as a switchman by the Southern
Pacific Company, was killed on Octo- !
b^r 12 last. He was on a freight train
and while passing Seventeenth ana \
lowa streets jumped from a car to
throw a switch. He struck against a
telegraph pole which was within six
inches of the track and fell across the
rails. Three cars passed over his body
before the train was pulled up. He
was a widower, 30 years of age, and
lived at 907 McAllister street. He had
been employed as a switchman for
only three months.

Brave Rescue by Launchman.
Edward Owens, after a long battle
with the tide, was saved from drowning
yesterday at El Campo by the quick
work of Asa Dawson, engineer of the
launch T. J. McNeill. Owens, who is
a saloonman at Fourth avenue and
Clement street, in some way fell from
the wharf and was swiftly carried into
the bay by the strong tide. He fran
tically struggled, but finding his work
of no avail, called for help. His cries
were heard by Dawson, who alone in
the launch unhesitatingly went to
Owens' aid and saved his life.

SWAMI POSES
AS CHAMPION
Condition of the American
Woman in Future Years
Gives Oriental Trouble
Swami Tri&unatita, -with Othello
esque dignity and in rich Oriental
garb, delivered 7 a lecture , last night in j
the upper V chamber 'of Golden Gate
Hall, which r was filled Iwith dignified
matrons, â  many . maidens and a sprink- ,
ling of masculine: braves. Swami's
lecture ,was "on "The Condition of the
Women of America in the Near Fu
ture, - from a Vedantist'a Standpoint."
'â  If those -i fair ;"â  women entered . the
chamber with a > contented mind it is
a \ certainty J that numerous of â¢ them
must have v had their.- usual i quiescent
condition rattled, \ for Swami -Triguna
tita called ,; poor man into the' ring,
metaphorically, and had several clean
' cut rounds 'â¢ with , him. the â¢ knock-out
blow coming when he ; landed between
the eyes of his ; unfortunate victim by
expressing wonder and indignation be
cause woman ,is ' not eligible for \ the
Presidency :of this ' great land. .
â¢' To show the ; baneful effect of the
suggestion, on > leaving the hall there
was an animated discussion between
three â  ladies â  who ;â¢ agreed ; with â  Swami,
feeling satisfied that they could easily
eclipse even Roosevelt had they the
; chance to shed their forensic brilliancy
from the : chief t executive chair.
- Swami -, blamed the American man
for : any short â  â¢weight In ' privilege *or
liberty that : was ; doled out to Ameri
can woman. ; He : said the women might
repay the treatment : they ; received tby
one day packing . up : their duds *. and
leaving the country for , : some other
land.
â¢ That was suggestion enough to cause
the sprinkling .of men to look .on with
alarm. i'- i^9 i 9''w9^BMs9K9BQB
He declared that the American gives
his . women-folk \ liberty enough . on the
cars and ion â ; the "Â« streets, but when -it
came to a political or national demon
stration the poor things "were kept at
horne â "dumb, useless personages, no
voice." J \: â¢:'â * ->;â¢ "â '/ :â¢*;â¢- â  'A /,.â 'â '- â 'â -'-.
There was an estimate of domestic
conditions -- that was - enough to * bring
tears ;: to i the ; ; reprobate -; sprinkling of
men Â» were the charge unfounded. .As
it was they sat obdurate and took the
lash with ? nervy â  indifference, showing
guilt â - conclusively.'393BÃ@HfeHMÃH
%: \ Swami, however, . : poured , a. ; homeo
pathic drop of healing ointment on the
wounds '< he ; had . : scratched '* by .< admit
? ting I that ]he r did 3 not blame 2 all * men.
Nevertheless he continued his ' excoria
i tion by giving f a scathing : rebuke to
\ . those :t who * before v marriage '; are like
r the buttercup to the bee, and subse
quent tto i the tying of the matrimonial
bands \ are i- In the ; home ; like i the â  tiger
in the Jungle- â¢"'Â«.: â  ~
"The \ moment they marry * their na
tures are revealed," .; said * Swami.
'/-'- He I then ? told of what â  the American
.did ; for the ,' lady if i he . desired sto edu
cate her. . "He '-will , - send â ? ' her to ; a
dancing school," he said, "and to a
r beauty ? school." but never ? did <he . edu- *
catere r her for the legal profession." - ;
:*" Delving deeper } into domestic life â¢as
â he "I imagined it ;, to be In America,
, Swami J alleged \ that "the , wife, the ' sis
ter, J the mother were allowed to scrub
â¢ their \ floors, brush ! their | boots and , sew
their socks, and why?" he 1 asked; "for
has woman not the. soul that man has?.
Then why put her to doing, such mean
.things?" :;;. .v.-;. 'v'
1 He expressed the belief that woman
1 should "T be r the ji co-worker â  with .; man.
I should co-operate with him in domes-
I tic and in national affairs. This is a
natural law and if broken, well, wÂ«Â«
to man, "for in that case." saM Swami,
"he shall suffer."
Many of the matrons and maidens
shook Swami cordially by the hand at
the close of the onslaught, the sprink
ling of men, mopping their heated
brow, filing out like lambs heading for
the slaughter.
