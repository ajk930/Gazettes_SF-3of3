>*Â»y HERLOCK HOLMES was a man
X>. who seldom took exercise for exer
v"j cisc's sake. Few men were cap
h*^ able of greater muscular effort,
and hÂ© was undoubtedly one of the
finest boxers of his weight that I have
ever seen, but he looked upon aimless
bodily exertion as a waste of energy, and
he seldom bestirred himself save where
there was some professional object to be
â¢erved. Then he was absolutely untiring
and indefatigable. That he should have
kept himself In training under such cir
cumstances Is remarkable, but his diet
was usually of the sparest and his habits
were simple to the verge of austerity.
Save for the occasional use of cocaine, he
had no vices, and he only turned to the
drug- as a protest against the monotony
of existence when cases were scanty and
the papers uninteresting.
One day In early spring he had so far
relaxed as to go for a walk with me In
the park, where the first faint shoots of
green were breaking out upon the elms
and the sticky spear-heads of the chest
nuts were Just beginning to burst Into
their five-fold leaves. For two hours we
rambled about together, in silence for the
most part, as befits two men who know
each other intimately. It was nearly S
o'clock before we were back In Baker
street once more.
"Beg pardon, sir," said our page boy as
he opened the door. "There's been a gen
tleman here asking for you, sir."
Holmes glanced reproacnfully at me.
"So much for afternoon walks," said he.
"Has this gentleman gone, then?"
"Yes, sir."
"Didn't ycu ask him in?"
"Yes, sir; he came in."
"How long did he wait?"
"Half an hour, sir. He was a very
restless gentleman, sir, a-walkin' and
a-ftampln' all the time he was here. I
*-Â«s waitln* outside the door, sir.. and. I
could h'-ar him. At last he out into the
passage, and he cries, 'Is that man never
roln' to come?' Those were his very
words, eir. 'You'll only need to wait a
little lonser,' says I, 'Then I'll wait In
the open air, for I feel half choked,' says
he. 'I'll be back before long.* And with
that he ups and he outs, and all I could
cay wouldn't hold him back."
"Well, well, you did your best." said
Holmes, as .we walked Into our room.
"It's very annoying, though, Watson, I
was badly in need of a case, and this
looks, from the man's Impatience, as if
It werÂ« of importance. Hullo! that's not
your pise on the table. He must have
left his behind him. A nice old brier with
a rood long stem of what the tobacconists
call amber. I wonder how many real
amber mouthpieces there are In London?
Some people think that a fly in It is a
.sign. "Well, he must have been disturbed
In his mind to leave a pipe behind him
which he evidently values highly."
"How do you know that he values it
highly?" I asked.
"Well, I should put the original cost
ef the pipe at seven and sixpence. Now
It has, you see, been twice mended, once
In the wooden stem and once in the am
ber. Each of these mends, done, as you
observe, with silver bands, must have
cost more than the pipe did originally.
The man must value the pipe highly
when he prefers to patch it up rather
than buy a new one with the same
money."
"Anything else?" I asked, for Holmes
was turning the pipe about In his hand,
and etaring at It in his peculiar pensive
way.
He held it up and tapped on it with bis
long, thin forefinger, as a professor might
who was lecturing on a bone, t
"Pipes are occasionally of extraordi
nary Interest," said he. * "Nothing has
more Individuality, save perhaps watches
and bootlaces. The indications here,
however, are neither very marked nor
very Important. The owner is obviously
a muscular man. left-handed, with an ex
cellent set of teeth, careless in his habits
and with no need to practice economy."
My friend threw out the Information in
a very off-hand way, but I saw that he
cocked his eye at me to see if I had fol
lowed his reasoning.
"You think a man must be well-to-do If
he smokes a seven-shilling pipe," said I.
â¢This is Grosvenor mixture at eight
pence an ounce," Holmes answered,
knocking a little out on his palm. "As he
might get an excellent smoke for half the
price, he has no need to practice econ
omy."
"And the other points?"
"He has been in the habit of lighting
his pipe at lamps and gas jets. You can
see that it is quite charred all down one
side. Of course a match could not have
done that. Why should a man hold a
match to the side of his pipe? But you
cannot light It at a lamp without getting
the. bowl charred. And it !s> all on the
right side of the pipe. From that I gath
ered that hÂ« Is a left-handed man. You
hold your own pipe to the lamp, and see
how naturally you. being right-handed,
hold the left side to the flame. You might
do It once the other way, but not as" a
constancy. This has always been held so.
Then he has bitten through his ember. It
takes a muscular, energetic fellow, and
one with a rood set of teeth, to do that.
But If I am not mistaken I bear him
upon' the stair, so we shall have some
thins more Interesting than his pipe to
study."
An Instant later our door opened, and a
tall young man entered the room. He
was well but quietly dressed la -a dark

gray suit, and carried a brown wide
awake In his hand. I should have put
him at about SO, though he was really
some years older.
"I beg your pardon," said he, with
some embarrassment; "I suppose I should
have knocked. Yes, of course, I should
have knocked. The fact is that I * am' a
iittle upset, and you must put it all down
to that." He passed his hand over his
forehead like a man who is half dazed,
and then fell rather than 6at down upon
a chair.
i'lfcan see that you have not slept for
a night or two." said Holmes, in his easy,
genial way. "That tries a man's nerves
more than' work, and' more even than
pleasure. May I ask how I can help
you?".
."I wanted your advice, sir. I don't
know what. to do, and my whole \ life
seems to havegone to pieces." .
"You wish to employ, me as . a \u25a0= consult
ing detective?" _ . -"-'
"Not that only. I want your opinion
as a judicious manâ as a man of the
world. I . want to know what " I ; ought ; to
do next. I hope-to' God you'll; be able
to tell me."
He spoke in little, sharp, Jerky out-,
bursts, and it seemed to me that to speak
at all was very painful to, him,. and that
his will all through' was overriding his
Inclinations.

were no houses until you got half way to

had ever been a secret between us.
gave her a chack, -and I never thought
any mors of the matter. It may have
nothing to do with what cam* after
wards, but -I thought It only rixht to
mention It.
"Well, I told you Juit now that ther* Is
a cottage not far from our nous*. Thera
la Just a field between us, hut to reach It
you have to so along the road and then
turn down a lane. Just beyond It Is a
nice little grove of Scotch firs, and X used
to be very fond of strolling down thare,
for. trees are always neighborly kind of
things. The cottage had been standing
empty this eight months, and It was* a
pity, for It was a pretty two-atoried pl^ca
with an old-fashioned porch and honey
suckle about It. I hays stood many a
time and thought what a neat Uttle homÂ«
stead it would make.
"Well, last Monday evening I was tak
ing a stroll down that way when I mat
an empty van coming up tha lana and
saw a pile of carpets and things lying
about on the grass plat beside tha porch,
It was clear that the cottage had at last
been let. I walked past it and then, stop
ping as an idle man might. I ran my eye
over it and wondered what sort of folk
they were who bad. coma to live so near
us. And as I looked I suddenly became
awaro that a faco was watching ras out
of one of the upper windows.
**I don't know what there was about
that face. Mr. Holmes, but It seemed to
send a chill right down my back. I was
some littlo way off. so that I could not
make out tha features, but thers was
something, unnatural and inhuman about
the face. That was thÂ« Impression that
I had, and I moved quickly forward to
get a nearer view of tha person who was
watching me. But as I did Â«o tha faca
\u25a0uddenly disappeared. Â«o suddenly that It
\u25a0eemed to have been plucked away Into
tha darkness of tha room. I stood for five
minutes thinking tha business over and
trying to analyze my Impressions. I could
not tell if the face were that of a man or
a woman. It had been too far from, ma
for that.' But its color was what had Im
pressed me most.- It was of a livid chalky
white, and with something set and rigid
about It which was shoclAngly unnatural.
So disturbed was I that I determined to
sea a llttla more of the new Inmates of
tha cottaga. - 1 approached and knocked
by a tali,* giunt woman, with a. harsh, far
' bidding 1 faca. . . , . ', /
' "/What may you ba , wantln'T* aha

. â¢* M am your neighbor over, yonder,'.^
said I, nodding toward my house. 'I sco
that. you have only Just moved In, so 1/
thought" that if I could' ba of any help to
you in anyâ"
'\u25a0 " *Ay. we'll Just ask ya when wÂ» want
ye,* uaid she, and shut the door In my
face. Annoyed at tha churlish rebuff. 1
turned my back and walked horns. All
evening, though I tried to think of other
' things, "my mind would still turn to tha
apparition at tha window and the rudeness
of tha woman. I determined to say noth
ing about the former to my wife, for shÂ»
is a nervous, highly-strung woman, and
I had no wish that sha should shara tha
unpleasant Impression which had bean
produced upon myself. I remarked to
her, however, before I fall asleep that tha
cottage was now occupied, to which sha
returned no reply.
"I am usually an extremely sound sleep
er. It' has been a standing Jest in the
family that nothing could ever wake me
during the night. And yet somehow on
that particular night, whether it may
have been the slight excitement produced
by my little adventure or not I know not,
but I slept much more lightly than usual.
Half in my dreams I was dimly .conscious
that something was going on In the room,
and gradually became aware that my wife
had dressed herself and was slipping on
her mantle and her_bonnet. My lips were
parted to murmur out some sleepy words
of surprise or remonstrance at this un
timely preparation, when suddenly my
half-opened eyes fell upon her face, il
luminated by the candle light, and aston
ishment held me dumb. She wore an ex
pression *such as I had never seen before
âsuch as I should have^ thought her In
capable of assuming. *She was deadly
pale and breathing fast, glancing furtive
ly toward the bed as she fastened her
mantle to see if she had disturbed me.
Then, thinking that I was still asleep, sha
noiselessly slipped from the room and an
instant later I heard a sharp creaking,
which could only come from the hinges
of the front door. * I sat up in bed and
rapped my knuckles against the rail to
make. certain that I was truly awake.
Then I took my watch- from under the
pillow. It was, 3 in the morning. What
on this earth qould my wife be doing out
on the country road at 3 in the morning?
â¢I had sat for about twenty minutes,
turning the thing over in my mind and
trying to find, some possible explana
tion. The more I thought the more ex-,
traordinary and inexplicable did it ap
pear. I was still puzzling over it when
I heard the door gently close again and
her footsteps coming up the stairs.
44 'Where in the world have you been,
Effle?* I asked as sha entered.
"She gave a violent start and a kind
of gasping cry when I spoke, and that
cry and start troubled ma more than
all -the rest, for there was something
indescribably guilty about them. My
wife had always been a woman ot a
frank, open nature, and it gave me a
chill to sea her slinking Into her own
room and cryins out and wincing when
her own husband spoke to her.
'â¢"You awake. Jack!" she cried, with a
nervous laugh. 'Why. I thought that
nothins could awake you.'
â¢â¢â¢Where' have you been?" I asked,
more sternly.
â¢" 1 don't wonder that you are sur
prised." said she.- and I could see that
her fingers were tremblins as she un
did the fastenings of her mantle. "Why,
I i never remember bavins don* Â«aca atiling in my life before. The fact is
that I felt as though I were choking
iLiid had a perfect longing for a breath
oi fiesh air. I really think that I
should have fainted if I had not gone
out. I stood at the door for a few min
utes, and now I am quite myself again.'
"All the time that she was telling
me this story she never once looked
in my direction and her voice was quite
unlike her usual tones. It was evident
to me that she was saying what was
talse. J said nothing in reply, but
turned my face to the wall, sick at
heart, with my mind filled with a thou
sand venomous doubts and suspicions.
What was it that my wife was conceal
ing: from me? Where had she been dur
ing that strange expedition? I ft.lt that
J should have no peace until I knew,
and yet I shrank from asking her
again after once she had told me what
was false. All tl.e rest of the night I
toÂ«sed and tumbled, framing theory
after theory, each more unlikely than
the last
"I should have gone to the city that
day. but I was too disturbed in my
mind to be able to pay attention to
business matters. My wife seemed to
be as upset as myself, and I could see
from the little questioning glances
which Â«he kept shooting at me that she
understood that I disbelieved her
statement and that she was at her wits'
end what to do. We hardly exchanged
a word during breakfast, and immedi
ately afterwards I went out for a walk,
that I might think the matter out in
the fresh morning air.
'T went as far as the Crystal Palace.
Epent an hour in the grounds, and was
back in Norbury by 1 o'clock. It hap
pened that my way took me past the
cottage, and I stopped for an instant
to look at the windows, and to see if
I could catch a glimpse of the strange
face which had looked out at me on
the day before. As I stood there,
Imagine my surprise, Mr. Holmes, when
the door suddenly opened and my wife
walked out.
"I was struck dumb with astonish
ment at the sight of her; but my emo
tions were nothing to those which
showed themselves upon her face when
our eyes met. She seemed for an In
rtant to wish to shrink back Inside
the house again; and then, seeing how
useless all concealment must "be, she
came forward with a very -white face
and frightened eyes which belied the
smile upon her lips.
" 'Ah, Jack,' she said, 'I have just
been in to see if I can be of any as
sistance to our new neighbors. "Why
do you look at me like that, Jack?
You are not angry, with me?*
"'So.' said I, "this is where^ou went
during the night.'
"'What do you mean?* she cried.
""You came here. I am sure of it.
Who are these people that you should
visit them at euch an hour?'
â¢" "1 have not been here before.'
" 'How can you tell me what you
know is false?' I cried. 'Your .very
voice changes as you speak. When
have I ever had a sceret from you?
I shall enter that cottage and I shall
probe the matter to the bottom.'
"'No. no. Jac^ for God's sake!" she
sasped. in incontrollable emotion. Then,
as I approached the door, she seized my
sleâ .e and pulled me back with convul
rive strength.
" 'I implore you not to do this, Jack.'
she cried. I swear that I will tell you
everything some day, but nothing but
misery can come of it If you enter that
cottage.' Then, as I tried to shake her
off, she clung to me in a frenzy of en
treaty.
"â¢TniEt me. Jackl' she cried. "Trust
me only this once. You will never have
cause to regret It.. You know that I
v.-ould not have a secret from yofr if it
were not for your own cake. Our whole
lives are at, stake In this. If you come

There was Molly Sue, a girl I knew
when she was 16, pretty, soft-man
nered, sweet-voiced, but, oh! bo lazy!
She drifted through successive schools
without learning anything, always
playing: the role of a good-natured, Ir
responsible shirk. Her kittenish ways
and dainty sweetness won her far too
many excuses from her teacher, and
among her friends the feeling was
well expressed by an artist, ivho said:
"Molly Sue does not need to know any
thing. It is quite enough to look at
her, as one looks at a perfect flower."
But Molly Sue did not stay 16. She
grew out of girlhood, as you will, too.
and after a while people forgot to no
tice her when she was in the room
with those who had brains and ideas.
The perfect beauty faded.' She became
a'withered rose. The vacant mind was
Sike a dusty lumber-room full of rub

If somebody had taken Molly Sue by
the shoulder- and shaken* her out of
her Jr.dolenee when she was a school
girl, she might have grown up an In
teresting woman.

" 'There was such earnestness, such
despair in her manner that her words ar
rested me, and I stood irresolute before
the .door.
" 'I.will trust you on one condition, and
on one condition only,' said i at last. Tt
is that this mystery comes .to an end
from now. You are at liberty to pre
serve your secret, but you must promise
me that there shall be no "more nightly
visits, no more doings which are kept
from my knowledge. I am willing to for
get those which are passed if yoir* will
promise that there shall be no more in
the future." ...
"'I was sure that you would trust me.'
she cried, with a great sigh of relief. 'It
shall be Just as you wish. Come awayâ
oh, come away up to the house.' .
"Still pulling up my sleeve, she led-rae
away from the cottage. As we went I
glanced back, and there was that yellow
livid face watching us out of the upper
window. What link could there be be
tween that creature and my. wife? Or
how could- the coarse, rough woman
whom I had seen the day before be con
nected with her? It was a strange puz
zle, and yet I knew that my mind could
never know ease again until I had solved
it. â¢
"For ,two days after this I stayed at
home, and my wife appeared to abide
loyally by our engagement, for, as far
as I know, she never stirred out of the
house. On the third day, however. I had
ample evidence that her solemn promise
was not enough to hold her back from
this secret influence which drew her
away from her husband and her duty.
"I had gone into town on that day, but
I returned by the 2:40 train Instead of the
3:36, which is my usual train. As I
entered the house the maid ran into the
hall with a startled face.
"'Where Is your mlstresar I asked.
" 'I think that she has gone out for a
walk,' she answered.
"My mind was instantly filled with sus
picion. I rushed upstairs to make sure
that she was not in the house. As I did
so I happened to glance out of one of the
upper windows and saw the maid with
whom I had just been speaking running
across the field in the direction of the
cottage. Then, of course, I saw exactly
what it all meant. My wife had gone
over there and 'had asked the servant to
call her If I should return. Tingling with
anger, I rushed down and hurtled across,
.determined â¢ to end the. matter once and
forever. I saw my wife and the maid
hurrying back along the lane, but I did
not stop to speak with them. In the
cottage lay the secret which was casting
a shadow over my life. I vowed that,
come what might, it should be a secret
no longer. I did not even knock when I
reached it, but turned the handle and
rushed Into the passage.
"It was all still and quiet upon the
ground floor. In the kitchen- a kettle was
singing on the fire and a large black cat
lay coiled up in the basket; but there was
no sign of the woman whom I had seen
before. I ran Into the other room, .but It
was equally deserted. Then I rushed up
the stairs; only to find two other rooms
empty and deserted at the top. There was
no one at all in the whole house. The
furniture and pictures were of the most
common and vulgar description, save In
the one chamber at the window of which
I had seen the. strange face. That was
comfortable and elegant, and. all my sus
picions rose Into -a filerce, . bitter flame
when I saw that on the . mantlepiece
stood a copy of a.fuU-length;photograph
of my wife, 1 which' had. been taken at. my
request' only three; months. j ago. .^ ; . \u0084
"I stayed' lorig k enbugh- to make certain
that "the -house was absolutely empty.
.Then'l- left it,, feeling a" weight at my
heart 'such as I had- never had before.
My wife' came out Into the hall as I en
tered my house; but I was too hurt and
angry to speak with her, and ' pushing
reluctantly acquired knowledge Is better
than none at all.
What I want to urge upon you Is to put
the emphasis of your efforts on the
studies you don't like. We all have
studies we love, and it is easy to pursue
them. For instance, Dorothy, who en-
Joys her English work, finds no difficulty
In keeping at the head of .her class, bit
when the question is of mathematics she
gropes about In the dark. If you will
glance over your classmates, you will
have no trouble In picking out a half
dozen Dorothys. Some of them come out
splendidly In history and axe dull in
physics; some shine In Latin, and cannot
tackle the simplest algebraic problem.
The point lor every such girl, don't you
think, is to spend strength and time and
really hard work on the bosk, the sub
ject, the situation, that she has no partic
ular aptitude for? The tnings one likes
one acquires without painstaking, but It
is painstaking that rewards one in the
end.
I don't think there is a pleasure In the
world that can be compared with an hon
est Joy In conquering a difficult task. It
is by hard work over what one docs not
enjoy that one gains that mastery of the
will and facility of the mind that make
the true distinction between, the educated
and the uneducated person. Natural
cleverness Is a good quality. But a better
one Is downright, sturdy, dogged perse
verance,' that never lets go, once it has
started on any line of work.
A schoolgirl should take stock of her
own capacity. > There is an old story of
a preceptress who wrote to the rich par
ent of a very dull pupil that his daugh
ter lacked capacity. "Buy. her one im
mediately," telegraphed the man of af
fairs. Ales! gold cannot buy capacity.
No outsider can give It you. But you
can buy It for yourself. -
You, Edith, who complain that you can
not remember that what you learn to-day
Is forgotten, to-morrow, may change all
that, if you will give your attention to
one thing at a time, and let nobody dis
turb you. Some girls are scatter-brained.
Don't be like them. Fix your, mind j>n a
single word, a single sentence, a single
paragraph, and compel it to understand
that ami to remember It. Memory is a
slave to those who. know how to com
mand it and make it obey.

This Is what happens to you, my dear
girl, whoever you are. It has happened
.to me many a time, so I know whereof I
speak. Never mind the locaJity; a girl In
the district school In the woods, a girl
in a town, a girl with every appliance,
or a gif 1 with few helps may have the
same experience. You tug along daunt
lessly. It is uphill work. You slip back
sometimes, but you plant your feet again
firmly, and; take a new start. You gain
a little ground to-day; a little more to
morrow. Suddenly you can't explain how
or why, the difficulties vanish, the husk
of trouble falls away, and out comes the
perfect flower, white, fragrant, satisfy
ing. You could not see yesterday, but you
see to-day. You had no vocabulary last
week, but words crowd on you now.
A girl I know was studying a new lan
guage. She kept walling over and over:
"I have no words. 1 have no words.. I
have to find out every word I want in
the- lexicon. It is an endless task. I
shall never understand, never catch up."
All at once words began: meeting her
with friendly faces. They were no longer
strangers. She knew their inflections,
their cadences; the vocabulary of another
language was her own. Hard work, had
brought its reward. "Never" is a word
to be turned away from one's door. There
need be no such word.^ .
School hours and prizes are worth striv
ing for. ; The girl who can win her teach
er's approval Js always enviable. "But
on the whole, 'the duir girl who wins It
with effort is more enviable than > the
bright one" who did not try hard. And
I believe that it is much more pleasant
to have the full approval of one's per
.sonar eonsclepce, to : know that, let hap
pen what may, one has done one's very
best,' than to carry off marks and medals
and certificates. " ,
Some of you are handicapped by hav
ing too many studies at^one and the
same time. It is unwise to attempt . too
much: M the class work includes more
letsona than you can assimilate., ask to
have some of them dropped. Teacher 3
are willing to aid. an earnest' pupil who 1
Is doing what she can to overcome: her
own deficiencies. But if you drop some
thing, let, it be the thing you am fond
of, not the thing you dislike.: The study
you rare for may be taken up. at any
time in the future. The other must be'
faced and conquered now, or it will never
give you the joy. of victory. , .

"Why do you think so?"' V Â« '
"How else. can we explain her fren
zied anxiety that her second one should
not enter it? The facts as I read them
are something like this: -This, woman
was married In America. Her husband
developed some hateful qualities; or
shall we say that he contracted some
loathsome disease, and became a leper
or an Imbecile? She flies fro"m him at
last, returns to England, changes her
name and starts her life, as she thinks,
afresh. She has been married three
years and believes that her position: is
quite secure, having shown her hus
band the death certificate of some man
whose name she has assumed, when
suddenly her' wherabouts Is discovered
by her first husband; or, we may sup
pose,*by' some unscrupulous woman
who has attached herself to the in
valid. ' They write to the wife and
threaten to come and expose her. She
asks for. a hunded pounds and en
deavors to buy them off. They come
In sslte of it, and when the husband
mentions casually âtoyâ to y the wife that
there are newcomers In the cottage,
she knows in some way that they are
her pursuers.' She waits until her hus
band is asleep, and then she rushes
down to ; endeavor to persuade them to
leave her in peace. Having no success,
she goes again next morning, and her
husband meets her, as he has told us,
as' she comes out. She promises him
then not to go there again, but two
days afterward the hope of getting
rid of : -those dreadful neighbors was
too strbng/for her, and she made an
other attempt, taking down with her
the photograph which had probably
been demanded from her. In the midst

' Composition- Writing, . '
(Copyright, 1905, by Joseph B. Bowles.)
KE day In the early summer 'It
Owas my good fortune to be in
vited to; what was called "A
Composition Reading" in a girls'
school of high character and
wide reputation.' It was a pretty sight
that' greeted my eyes. The girls of all
ages, from 10 to IS, were dressed in
white, and their sweet faces and lovely
manners entitled them to be called, if
ever girls deserved the name, winsome
schoolgirls., \-'-- 7-<7 -<
The programme of the morning in
cluded essays in English composition,
written by members Â»of every class in
the ; school, from the lowest . to the
highest. There was great variety, both
in subjects and in treatment. Full play
was given to originality, and no two
compositions were alike. The teacher
who! had charge of the worki told ;me
that so far from disliking to write, the
girls loved the exercise, and that her
classes were the most popular in the
curriculum,
- 1 don't know.- how 'It may seem to
the girls whom* l am talking" with to
day. 'They "may enjoy, writing compo
sitions or they may dread and dislike
this part of school duty. ' It depend*
a good deal on the way one begins,
whether one likes or dislikes anything.
If one Is called upon to write a. com
position ,on a' topic which: does not in
terest her, and which she knows abso
lutely nothing about, ; she.- cannot ex
pect to find v much fun or . much inter
est in so dry a task. * The important
thing' is to have something to say.
Composition is the art of having some
thing to say, and saying it- agreoably,
with, due 'regard to the rules of , good
English. ";:
If one wishes to excel In thisbranch
of education one must first of all bo
willing â¢to? (take great pains. If i
were teachings group of gh-Js I: would;
say.' "Write your theme at the top or.
your page,* then stop and ask yourself
what' you- know about it." If you are
\u25a0 ."You are quite determined to do this,
in' spite~of your wife's warning that It
isibetter that you 'should not solve the
mystery?"
"Yes, I am determined."
"Well, I think that you. are In the
right." Any truth is better than in
definite doubt.* We had better go up
at . once.;." Of course, legally, we are
putting ourselves hopelessly in the
wrong, but. l think it i|3. worth it." *â¢
.It was a very, dark night and a thin
rain began to fall as wo turned from
the high road into a narrow lane, deep
ly rutted, with hedges on either side.
Mr. Grant Munro pushed i impatiently
forward, . however, and we stumbled
after . him as best we could. -
"There are the lights of my house,"
he murmured, pointing to. a glimmer
among the trees. "And here is the cot
tage which I am going to enter."
"We turned a curner in the lane as
he spoke, and there was the building
close beside us. A yellow bar falling
across the black foreground showed
that the door was not quite closed, and
one window in the upper, story was
brightly illuminated. As we looked wo
saw a. dark blur moving across the
blind. . .
-'"There Is that creature!" cried Grant
Munro. "You can see for . yourselves
that some one is there. Now follow
me and we shall soon know all."
We approached the door, but sudden
ly a woman appeared out of the shadow
and. stood in the golden, track, of the
lamplight. I could not see her face
In the darkness, but her arms were
thrown out in an attitude of entreaty.
"For God's sake, don't, Jack!" she
cried. "I had a presentiment that you
would come this evening. Think bet
ter of, it, dear! Trust me again, and
you will never have cause to regret it."
"I have trusted you too long, Eflle,"
he cried sternly. "Leave go of me. I
must pass you. My friends and I are
going to settle this matter once and
forever!" He pushed her to one side
and we followed closely after him. As
he threw the door open an old woman
ran out in front of him and tried to
bar his passage, but he thrust 'her back,
and an instant afterward we were -all
upon the stairs. Grant Munro rushed
into the lighted room at the top and we
entered at his heels.
- It was a cozy, well-furnished apart
ment, with two candles burning upon
the table and two upon the mantel
piece. In the corner, stooping over a
desk, there sat what appeared to be a
little girl. Her face was turned away
as we; entered, but we could see that
she was dressed In a red frock and that
she had long white gloves oni As she
whisked to us I gave a cry- of
surprise and horror.' ;The face .which
she -turned toward us was of -the
strangest livid tint and the . features
were absolutely devoid of any expres
sion. An Instant later the mystery' was"
explained. . Holmes, .with a : laugh,
passed his hand behind, the child's ear,
a mask peeled off from her countenance
and ; there -wtas a little coal-black
negress. with all her white teeth flash-
Ing in. amusement at our -amazed faces.
I burst out laughing, out of sympathy
with her merriment; but Grant -Munro'
stood staring, with hand. clutching his
throat. . . ... - â¢
"Aiy <sod!":he cried. ."What can be the
meaninjr of this?"., â¢ .â¢
."I will tell you : the meaning of It," cried
the lady, sweeping into the room with a
proud, set* face. ; "You have forced me,
against my -own judgment, to tell you,
and now we 'must both maxe the best of
It.. My. husband, died at Atlanta. My
child survived." -â¢"\u25a0/â¢"
/. '.'Your chilu?" â¢ .'â¢â¢
r,She drew a large silver locket from her
bosom. "You have never seen this open."
' "I understood that it die not open."
' She touched a spring and the front
hinged back. There was a portrait within
to. write the story, of a Journey, go
back in memory to the day you started
and tell": in an orderly fashion the vari
ous steps, you , took, by what* train or
boat you traveled, what incidents ar
rested your attention on the way and
how you were impressed whenyou,ar
rived at your destination. . _vi
.Thefe are people who go through the
world as if they had no ", eyes. . They
see little because they do not look.
The one who looks around her will
find interesting incidents in the short
est walk, or drive, or trip by train.
In describing: a place or. a jaunt there
is this to be remembered, that you
wish to fix the emphasis on the strong
est points and slide over without men
tion little details that are simply com
monplace. For Instance, it is not
necessary to say that the conductor
came through the train and took up
the tickets. As everybody knows,
conductors always do this. But If
you had an experience that I once had.
on a leisurely train, in .a Southern
State, when the conductor signaled the
engineer while. 'some of the lady pas
sengers went out of the cars and gath
ered .flowers by ' the roadside, you
might tell about it. In other, words,
tell of the unusual, not of the ordinary.
If your composition is to be historical,
and its central figure is one of the coun
try's men of renown; as, for. instance,
George .Washington, Robert E. Lee, or
some other man whose deeds have passed
into history, you would best read what
you can find about the man and his pe
riod. On no account write your composi
tion with the book you have read before
you. As you read make notes, if you
choose, ho that you may be accurate
when you mention a place or a date, but
put wholly aside before you" begin to^
write the volume you have been consult
ing;. I You wish to wrlteyour composition

I sent a hundred pounds to the nurse and

little face and hands so that even those
who might see her at the window should
not gossip about there being a black child
in the neighborhood. If I had been less
cautious I might have been more wise, but
I was half-crazy with fear that you
should learn the truth.
"It was you who told me first that the
cottage was occupied. I should have
waited for the morning, but I could not
sleep for excitement, and so at last I
slipped out, knowing how difficult it is to
awaken you. But you saw me go, and
that was the beginning of my troubles.
Next day you had my secret at your mer
cy, but you nobly refrained from pursu
ing your advantage. Three days later,
however, the nurse and child only just
escaped from the back door as you rushed
in at the front one. And now to-night
you at last know all. and I ask you what
is to become of usâ my child and me?"
She clasped her hands and waited for an
answer.
It was a long ten minutes before Grant
Munro broke the silence, and when his
answer came it was one of which I love
to think. He lifted the little child, kissed
her and then, still carrying her. toe held
bis other hand out to his wife and turned
toward the door.
"We" caa talk it over more comfortably

Not another word did he say of the case
until late that night, when he was turn-

bedroom;- \u25a0\u25a0â¢
"Watson," said he. "If It should ever
strike you that I am getting a little over

ask yourself what pleased you most in

Try to tell the story briefly, taking from
it the important points and omitting
much of the conversation and the minor
episodes. One of the most prominent
American authors, a man whose name la
famous wherever English is spoken, put*
the entire substance of a long novel into
three pages of note paper before he be
gins to write his book. If an author can
do this in composing the framework of a
novel, a school : girl writing about the
book.' when she has read It, may learn
how to sketch the story the same way.
Doing this gives splendid pratlce in writ

answer it, as the key on the piano re

Every schoolgirl should learn how to
write a letter. A business letter should
be straightforward and lucid, telling pre
cisely what one wants, in the fewest
words. A letter written to the home peo
ple, when one is absent, should be very
much like, a pleasant bit of talk. It
should not take for granted-that the ab
sent know, all that is going on: it should
tell" them every trifle. Above all. It
should answer any questions they may
have put in letters they have sent.
In old times, there were pet phrases
with which people began their letters.
Ruch as: "I -take my pen In hand to
write a few lines," or "Having a half
hour to spare this afternoon. I thought
I could not spend It better than In writ
ing to you." etc.' These phrases have
quite gone out. and are not at all neces
sary. Begin your letter as you would

your letter represent you. Use the same

to face with you* correspondent.

cleverly and forcibly.THE contest over the codicil of the
will of the late Samuel Davis baa
â¢ brought to San Francisco the dean
in the East of handwriting experts.
Colonel Edwin B. Hay of Washington City,
whose fame has spread far and wide, and
S^ho is known in his peculiar art
frora ocean to ocean, at home and
abroad. Being at the capital of
the nation. his opinion has been
sought !n all departments of the Govern
ment wherein questioned documents have
been the Issue; and In the noted cases at
court he has been called to assist Judge
and Jury in forming opinions upon both
Fpurious and genuine writings: 6O that
his advent upon the coast is a matter of
some concern to those Interested in the
subject of the comparison of handwriting
from a scientific standpoint.
CoJonel Hay's experience, extending over
a quarter of a century, very naturally
would bring to one of keen observation
as he possesses many interesting inci
dents wherein his art applies.
In the year 1877. when Simon Cameron
was at the zenith of his political glory
Â«s the leader of his party in the State of
Pennsylvania, being its senior Senator, he
occupied the position of a central figure in
the United States Senate, having been
also the first Secretary of War in the
great Cabinet of Abraham Lincoln. He
was brought into the brilliancy of a new
light of notoriety when one Mary Oliver
began a suit against him for breach of
promise. His Immense wealth, public po
sition, good reputation and high standing
ms.de him a shining mark for the arrows
of any assailant of his character along
any line of attack. Whetner he had in
the mellow maturity of his age yielded
to the subtle blandishments of fair wom
en under the cloak of fascination made by
stolen Eweets was a subject that caused
the social and political world of those
times to put on its thinking cap, and very
naturally the name of the venerable Sen
ator was upon the lips of every scholar
in the school for scandal and was tossed
about for the time being- unmercifully
upon the vacillating sea of politics in
both parties at the national capital and
in his own big State. The Senator with
a feeling of indignation quickly siid:
"Not one cent for tribute, but millions for
defense!" He made no offering to soothe
Mary's bleeding heart. "Blackmail!" was
the word he used. General Butler, the
. sio s t hated relic of the war In the South,
the most popular politician in Mas.=a
chusets and the most astute and able
lawyer of his time, was the senior coun
sel to defend the Senator in the cause, â¢
which was tried In the Supreme Court
of the District of Columbia, It was the
most noted trial of those days, second
only to the famous Sickles trial, where
the well known general was arraigned for
killing Philip Barton Key, and the trial
of the Surratt conspirators for the as
sassination of our beloved Lincoln, which
trials were held in the same court. Mary
Oliver based her cause upon a letter,
which she claimed was written by Camer
on, In which he. It is alleged, said "will
you be by wife?" The question, therefore,
turned, as in the Sharon case, the Fair
will case and the Samuel Davis codicil,
upon the question of handwriting.
â Such cases had not been numerous
theretofore, hence It attracted general
attention, and the journals of all the
' large dtle* In the East made the un
usual detail of special reporters,' no that
verbatim reports of the testimony were
given to the country every day. Colonel
Hay was the expert witness who declared
tbÂ» letter of proposal to be a forgery,
kwslch opinion, after several weeks' trial,
was corroborates by the jury. In the
comparison, upon the witness stand, when
he was explaining the differences . in the -
styles of' handwriting, he commented
upon the fine, the bold, the round and
the running hand, stating the difference
usually to be observed in concise, hasty
and carelsss or careful methods of writ-
Ing; stating that, apart from social and
personal letter, the business hand
was generally a free, running hand. The
cross-examiner, the counsel for ' Mary
Oliver, Judge Peter of Maryland, in the
vehemence of overjoyed excitement, hav
ing discovered a loop in the testimony
of the witness by which he thought he
could lasso him. asked "what kind of a
band is this?" pointing to the letter.
"A business hand." .said Colonel Hay.
With delight, the counsel repeated, "A
business band! Look at it. gentlemen of
the Jury â a business hand!" and, turn
ing to the witness, "and so you call that
a business hand?" Colonel Hay quietly
responded: "Yes, sirâ 'will you be my
wife?'â that's business!" The court, the
jury, the counsel and spectators broke
out into laughter that continued for many
minutes. That incident decided the case
in favor of. Simon Cameron.

low fever in 1555, being the first victim
of the life-devastating scourge. Forty
years afterward a letter was received
from. Paris and produced by the propo
nent of a will, which made her the bene
flciary, stating that "If search would be
made in a garret an old cow-hide-covered
trunk, ornamented with close, round,
brass-headed tacks, would oe found, un
der the right-hand corner of the top
covering of which would be found a last
will and testament of the deceased."
The letter was purported to have been
written by a contemporary of the de
ceased forty years after his death. The^ â¢
proponent testified that she read the let-*
ter to another person and requested the
party to find the trunk, remove the
hundreds of tacks and lind the will where
it had presumably slept so 'long.
The alleged will was witnssed by
a well-known Catholic priest and two
distinguished doctors, all of \ whom
had passed away. The yellow fever
does not give much opportunity to
its victim to make a will in his own
handwriting, nor, indeed, does it allow
a will-making state of mind. Therefore
to permit such an act to be done and
a secretion of the document under the
hide cover of an old trunk to be nailed
down with a hundred or more brass tacks
would, indeed, be a miracle; yet, as in
all cases of the kind, there are friends
of the beneficiaries willing to believe that
the Impossible and improbable could be
possible, and, without knowing, give
thoughtless opinion of the genuineness
of such a document. This was a case
for the expert in handwriting, and Colo
nel Hay was called upon for his opin
ion. He found that the letter from Paris
of recent origin compared favorably with
the handwriting of the will and that both
documents were in the handwriting of
the proponent. The will was not admit
ted to probate and the parties very fool
ishly compromised.
Anonymous communications are ithe
fruit of disordered minds and degen
erate natures. A Presbyterian minis
ter in a certain prominent church came
to Colonel Hay in the East and related
a tale of woe concerning the pestilence
of anonymous postal cards that in
fested his home, his church societies
and his congregation. They aimed at
the virtue of the minister's wife and
traduced young men and women of
the church. They criticized the min
ister, his sermons and accused him of
many compromising relations with the
more attractive members of his com
munion. The wife, a sensitive crea
ture, above approach, was driven to a
bed of illness, 'while the minister, in
his duties, could not eliminate from his
mind that In his congregation was the
unknown worker of iniquity; while the
officers of the church changed their
meetings from sacred conferences Into
a band of detectives, resolving upon
ways and means to find the culprit.
Colonel Hay's first request was for a
submission to him of a specimen of the
handwriting of every female member
of the congregation. The sin of Eve
does not always necessarily follow Its
example, nor is 'Colonel Hay otherwise
than a most gallant gentleman, but it
does seem true that in most all the
spicy incidents of romance and delicate
deviltry that there is a woman at the
bottom of it. In reducing by compari
son many hundred spcimens down to
one. It was found to be that of the
daughter of the foremost member of
the congregation, a deacon of the
church. When Informed of the result
of the examination and the accusa
tion the minister was astounded and
was greatly perplexed at the method
to be pursued to bring the party and
the guilt together beyond a reasonable
doubt. The matter was already in the
secret service of the Postofflce Depart
ment and the Inspectors had been
working on the case without success.
Colonel Hay volunteered to settle the
matter. Not wishing to bring v dlsgrace
upon a young* lady of good repute and
mortification to a family of estimable
standing, he approached the father of
the young" lady and â¢ said: "You have
had a postal card conflict In your
church?" "Yes," responded the father,
"to our great distraction and dismay.
We are greatly puzzled as to the au
thor." "I know who it is," quickly re
plied the colonel. "Who?" "Your
daughter!" he replied.* A \ shot from a
pistol could; not have more stunned the
father. "It's a lie !'\ he shouted; "I.de
mand your informer!" Advising calm
ness in the old gentleman, the colonoJ
said. "I am my own Informer." The dea
con reiterated that his daughter could not
have done such a thing, that she would
make an affidavit.* Colonel Hay sent

to her, "I knowjwho wrote the pQS

"Who did?" There was a dramatic sit
uation which words cannot describe,
when looking her In the eye, the
colonel exclaimed, "You!" No insulted

twirling, prolonged, sarcastic and air
cutting, "Sir-r-r-r!" No tragedienne
ever towered higher in her forceful

asked for. resided upon a large country
estate in the jurisdiction of that office.
Another letter, addressed to the party
sought,' asking something- about real
estate values in the section named, re
ceived a response. The expert. Colonel
Hay, was called in. The writings, near

JUDGMENT DAY IS
NOT UNREALITY
IF ANY; doubt has lingered in any
mind touching the validity of the
good old doctrine of judgment day,
that doubt ought to have been re
moved ,by what has transpired In
New York during the last few weeks.
There was a set of men there who, up
to a short time ago, were drawing prince
ly salaries, enjoying their yachts and
fast -horses and giving sumptuous din
nersâliving, )in short, the kind of life
which rich fast men live the world over,
only with this distinction, that these men
were the officials of an organization sup
posed "to." exist to protect the Interests
of widows and; orphans. . Associated with
these men were others whose personal
tastes may not \u25a0 have \ been quite as lux
urious, but who shared the same con
ception of the uses of a fiduciary agency,
namely, that the primary, consideration'
was not how much they could do to re
duce the cost of insurance, for people
in' moderate circumstances, while at the
same time getting a generous living them
selves,; but rather how In every way
possible they might serve their own ends,
through , exceptional opportunities pre
sented to them for personal aggrandize
ment. .' ' . - . -.
But by and by these men began to fall
out; among; themselves, and soon the
searchlight of - public ; investigation ' was
turned ' upon \ them. , and in the heat of
indignation , that has ' followed many a
former excellent reputation has been done
to a crisp. : In other .Words, judgment day
has come to :- town. ' arid what â¢; was done
of -. a : tricky ', nature ( in small meetings of
directors : arid .: committees^ is being pro
claimed 4 upon " the - housetops. , Was there
ever 'a* more vivid J proof \u25a0 the assertion:
''.Whatsoever, a jnan soweth/; that shall he
also reap?"" ;\u25a0 _;â¢'.-" '-; : \u0084

above 'all i the' Galileans? \u25a0' Nay, but except
ye s repent"; ye" shall all likewise I perish.";
Wherever "we - live"; we : do V riot have to

And yet" men] go on In their crooked ca

quarter. So the Pension Office is a flle
room of manuscripts. .It seems hard
to a claimant, justly entitled, to compel
him to furnish cumulative proof, but
the Government needs as much security
as does the bank teller In paying out
the" funds of the -bank. With all tho
safeguards "and undue vigilance it has ,
not escaned fraud. /
One case in Virginia was especially no
ticeable because of- the evasions. In each
line of preparation, of the watchfulness
which is put around every case. "A long
lane that has no turn" is a true saying.
A mis-stroke of the peaâ an awkward
joining of lettersâ the cross of. a "T,**
and the dotting of an "I" has often led
to the detection of crime. Suspicion
rested upon one of the vouchers that be
longed to the agency near Lynchburg. Va.
This voucher, with all the others, cover
ing a period of fourteen years, was sub
mitted to Cold'nel Hay. who has been for
years the expert for the ', United States
Government at Washington. Ha un
earthed the imposition upon the Pension
Office that had been going on for many
years and upon which the parties to It
had been the beneficiaries. They had re
ceived, the money so regularly and had
executed the papers so calmly and so for
mally that they grew in the belief of tho
honesty of the transaction and so pur
sued fearlessly the even tenor of their
way. A widow was the claimant and her
brother was the able and willing assist
ant and accomplice, who thought It "no
harm to rob the crown." An Indictment
astounded the parties, and they defended
In an Interesting trial, conducted by the
present Governor of Virginia. Montague,
who was then, as United States District
Attorney filling" the courts with the elo
quence that led him to the Governor's
chair. Colonel Hay pointed out tho same
ness of the handwriting not only In the
signatures to affidavits, but to every
voucher upon which money had been re
ceived. After his demonstration to 'the
court and Jury the parties confessed their
guilt and have been serving time ever
since.
The money order division of the Post
office Department Is often the victim.
Handwriting has been traced frequently
to the wrongdoers, but thinking to foil
detection, a dirk in the department, who.
with accomplices, carried on for a time a
very profitable business, utilized the type
writer and forged only the Postmaster's
signatured "Once too often," applied In
lhl3 case. Experts should not claim, to
detect typewriting, but clrcnmstancess fa
vored the Government In this Instance.
Colonel Hay requested specimens of every
machine In the Money Order Department.
Each machine was numbered. The scores
of money orders and advices were com
pared with the specimens with a success-,
f ul result. The man was convicted* The
money orders throughout universally had
the omission of the dot upon tho small
"r.*" The machine specimen was found
with this same fatal omission and tho
missing dot became the accuser. This
could not happen with all typewriting.
\u25a0 happened to others, they win somehow
manage to avoid exposure and punish
ment. For there often Is a delay In the
working out of justice. Sometimes men
who ought to.be wearing prison garb go
to their graves in apparent' good stand
ing in the community. But delay does
not mitigate the penalty, when It comes.
as Anne of Austria said -to Richelieu:
"My Lord Cardinal, God does not pay at
the end \u25a0of every week, but In tha end
he pays." And because the sword \u25a0 has
not yet descended on us, we need not
delude ourselves with the. notion, that
our sin has been overlooked or forgotten.
Nor need we think that Judgment day
must come in one form, only, always in
flicting some public condemnation and in
volving the lonely prison cell. Sometimes
our misdoing is followed by remorse and
self-loathing harder to', bear than the
taunts of others. "No one will ever know
It," said a tempting voice one* to a young
man on the edge .of a moral collapse.
"No, but I should know it." was his
quick and Indignant rejoinder, and he
drew back from the edge of tha precipice.
Judgment day often writes Its , penalties
on a man's countenance and ' causes .. a
stupefying of conscience, an emasculation
of will and a drying up of the ' fountains
of affection. You may escape the police
man all your life, but you can. never
escape the painful reaction on your own
life of every evil word and deed.
The reason for judgment day. lies in the
fact that this universe is built on right
eous lines and sooner or later the man
who seeks to trifle with the right is made
to realize- that he Is In helpless revolt
against Inevitable law. Things are not
left at loose ends in this universe. Sin
breeds troubles of many kinds. It has to
be expiated somehow, somewhere,* some
time. . . .
There is a picture on the front of a fa
mous church in Paris which represents
the last judgment; with Christ apportion
ing* their flnar destiny to the wicked and
the good. ' sending to the left those who
had done wrong, and waving to " a place
on his right hand the righteous.' Thi3
representation of the judgment has had a
powerful hold through the ages on 'the
Infaglnatlon of men.. It embodies a ; great
truth; but it does not set forth' the entire
; truth, ami whatever befthe nature of the
final judgment be sure that in: a. sense'
every day Is judgment day, that It Is "as
certain to come a3 .to-morrow's sunrise
and for all of us who, would, escape "its
terrors there- are three words to be said,

TRUST

fT^HERE was Riggs' bill for hay;
I that was $7. There was Morse's
I bill for pasture, due the day before
I âthat was $3 75â and there was the
V,** old bill against Judge Blair for
butter and milk, $6 70, and nothing had
been peifi on It for two months.
It really seemed to Captain Meyers,
picking .his way along the rough stone
walk upon the side streets and often
walking in the path beside it that there
would be no difficulty at all in collecting
the JS that he and his wife had decided
to epend upon their daughter Mattle's
birthday present. The captain made up
'his mind, as he trudged along, to collect
all the money and to buy the present
that afternoon and have it over. with.
And to that end he hurried past Riggs'
livery barn and on toward the postoffice,
acting on the theory that If he" went to
the bam so yoon after dinner he would
not flnd Riggs there.
It was just mail time when the captain
arrived at the postoffice. He waited there
patiently while the mail was distributed.
and looked at the trinkets In the jewel
er's case in the front part of the lobby.
He fancied a certain gold and onyx pin.
â¢which be had looked at In the morning,
and which he had then decided to buy
for his daughter's birthday present with
the money he was about to collect He
knew that his wife wanted the famlly
present to be a new dress; there had been
some discussion on the subject before he
left the houst that noon after the child
had gone to school, but the captain's
heart was set on the pin. And as he
stood peering Into the glass case his faith
In It became firmly fixed. He might have
bought the pin then and there, but he
feared he would be refused credit, and
the prospect of a humiliating refusal fre-
Suently kept the captain out of debt. As
he was feasting his eyes upon the pin his
' neighbor. John Morse, who owed the
captain for pasture rent, elbowed along
beside him.
"Hullo, John." said the captain, look
ing up suddenly and recollecting that
lie was going to collect his bill In the
â¢ afternoon, and a little fluttered at the
prospect. "They make a lot of durn
.fool purties â them jewelers â don't
'they? Keep a feller pore just at look at
em. purt' nigh, don't you think ?*\ ;.â¢
."I dunno. cap." replied the other
man. who was a trifle 111 at ease in
the presence of his creditor and wished
to ward off a dunnlnar. "I dunno. I
suppose It's as easy to get pore lookln'
sx the fixln's as it Is a-layln' 'round do
.in' nothin,' as a feller's rot to do these
' days. And when you do get a little job
of work It seems like you can't never
get the money on it"
- Here Captain Meyer's heart sank; he
. was being outgeneraled, and he knew
it. Morse Trent on:
"I done a little job over here for Ma
jor Hanley the other day and went
down this rnornin' to collect it â
â¢xhought mebbe might get a little some
thin* and square up with you and a few
odd bills aroundâ but by Johnny. If
i Major didn't stand me off trll the first
of the month."
The crowd was moving and the cap
tain knew that the delivery window of
the postoffice was open. He didn't
want to teem a hard man with his
neighbors, co he said as they walked
toward the center of the crowd:
"Oh, well. John, me and you under
stand each other; you needn't to go
and worry about that little business of
mine. I ain't in no rush."
The captain's Veteran Defender was
in his box, and when he had put it in
his pocket he drifted in the current of
the crowd and found himself being car
ried up the broad smooth stone side
walks of the business street to the row
of Straggling one-story frame offices,
carpenter shops and millinery stores
th*t marked the dividing line between
thÂ» residence and business portions of
taÂ» town. As he came to the crossing
a fenggy bumping orer the stones
stopped a group of which he was a
member.
-Who's that with Riggs in the buggy? "
**ktd the captain.
. "Oh him? Why that's a drummer. I
heard HtÂ» say he was going to drive over
to Fairview to catch the main line South
to-algbt," said an elderly member of the
party, who responded when any one spoke
to the "ColoneL" It would be wrong to
say that Captain Meyers' heart sank at
hearing this, for he thought with a feel-
Jng of relief that to-morrow would be the
best time to collect Riggv' bill, anyway.
The group sauntered into .one of the lit
tle offices, as was the custom of its mem
bers, and the Captain told himself that
be would wait until Judge Blair had fin
ished his mall before disturbing him.
The Colcntl and "Doe" and "J. I*"
and the Captain, that was the coterie,
j They had become cronies during the years
that followed the "boom" and left them
Idle. The Colonel had been County Sur
veyor. "Doc" had been Coroner years
ago, before the young doctors crowded
him out of practice, and "J. I^." was the
real estate dealer who owned the office.
Captain Meyers had Jbeen County Clerk
two terms, deputy one term, then City
Clerk, and. finally, constable; he was
sometimes made deputy sheriff when
there was extra work. But he was at the
end of his political rope. By close living
tys wife had saved the farm near town
which was their homestead before they
icoved to the county seat. She had saved
a little money, which was at Interest
and the family lived off the farm and
email (ami comlns from chickens and
butter and eggs. The Captain's only
cnito was a girlâ Mattieâ thirteen years
old, and on her he lavished the affection
of a heart still mellow. As he sat In
the office "gassing" with the crowd, he
thought of the pin and how beautiful it
was, and how the child would enjoy it
and he almost lost the thread of conver
sation.
"Don't you, cap?" said the colonel.
"_on't I what.'" paid the captain, wak-
Ing from his reverie. "I do, if you say I x
do. but what is it?"
"Well," explained the first speaker, "*
was just sayin* that' there was just as
smart folks down here on the 'Crick*, as
they is up there in the city, if they only
had the swing that the other fellows had.
And I said that's what you said, dont',
you, cap'n?"
"That's Just what I've contended all.
the ume; don't take no smarter man to
run a railroad than to run a street car
line; and don't take no more brains to
run a street car'n it does to run a stage
line, and no more to run a stage 'n It
does to run a dray, and a man that can't
run a dray ain't worth his salt."
"That's right." broke In the real estate
man. I've seen it work time and again.
Now. take that Rushmer feller \ warn't so
overly much down here; I done him. up
myself in a little deal in College Hill lots.
Now look at him up there -in the city;
got a carriage and a nigger driver, and"
every one thinks he's old persimmons.
It's all owin' to the length of the leever
you're workln' with. If you're worktn'
with cents, you make cents'; ij the handle
of your leever is a little longer^'and
you're workin' with dollars, you make
dollars; if it's hundreds, you make hun
dreds, and if it's thousands you get your
picture in the paper as a 'Napoleon of -
finance.' " ,
"I guftss that's mighty near the truth,
said the doctor in the sententious pause
that followed.
The captain was just starting for Judge
Blair's to collect the butter and milk bill
when he saw the Judge come out of his
office and go down the street. He settled
back in Ills' seat by the window to wait
until the Judge returned. The talk droned
along. From "Napoleons of finance" it
turned to trusts, and from trusts to the
great fortunes made in the insurance
business. And it must have been nearly
4 o'clock when the captain held the reins
of the rambling discourse, and was guid
ing It by mere impulse as follows:
"Yes, sir: a undertakers* insurance
company. A sort of * undertakers' trust.
F*r Instance, say our man Nichols here
belonged; s'pose I'd pay him, say, J5 a
year and would agree to keep It up for
the rest of my life if he would give roe
a certain specified burlaL All right Say
I move away from here. Very welL ,1
have my J receiptâ my policyâ from old
man Nichols, and I go to the member_of
the Insurance company, or trust, or what
you may call it. that lives there, end pay
him while I live there. Then If I move
on I keep transferring my policy, and- at
last I'm buried In style and my family
ain't out a red. The trust has got the
money, and if I only pay the last man
a $5 bill the trust pays him for givln' me
a good burial. They have the use of my
money; I don't feel it; all right; and in
the end it ain't hard for my family to
raise the money, when they don't know
where to turn to get it. Rales can be
Just like insurance rates, high or low,
accordin' to the age a man is and tne
style he wants to go out with."
"Then your idee," put in the real estate
man, "is to take dyin' out of the lux
uries of the rich and put it In the reach
of all." . .. \u25a0"'
The crowd laughed.
Captain Meyers laughed with the. rest,
but hie eyes glowed, and he was filled
with the scheme that had evolved from
his talk. It seemed bo plain and feasible
to hlm-this plan of forming !an Â«*naer
takers* trust to Insure men decent burial.
He saw that if he could get a place at
the head of such an enterprise and push
It to a reality he would be rich. He was
afraid lest some of his companions should
see the value of the idea, and he let the
talk roll over him saying nothing further
of what was In his mind.
Judge Blair, passing along the street
toward his office, aroused the Captain
from his castle building. . As he crossed
the street to Judge Blair's office he con
cluded to take the Judge into his. plans.
He would need a partner, and a lawyer
and a man of the world, he. thought.
Judge Blair was three in one and one in
three-the- very trinity be wanted.
The Judge was the county politician; he
knew all the 6tateHmen in the State; he
knew the bankers and the lawyers and
the editors in the big city. In fact, when
any one spoke of Willow Creek beyond
its corporate limits he always spoke of
It as Judge Blair's town. Judge Blair was
always In debt, yet his credit remained
good, because he paid In smlleg and pat
ronage and railroad passes what he could
not pay In cash; so the town took what
he had to offer, and discounted it by pity
ing him for what it called "his extrava
gant family." He was Captain Meyer's
ld.ol; he sometimes paid â¢ the -captain
moneyâ an unusual distinctionâ and he al
ways got the captain railroad passes to
the State G. A..R. reunion*.
The captain was fairly bubbling with
enthusiasm when he reached Judge
. Blair's private office. The Judge thought
Captain Meyers had jwoe to for
money, as, in fact, he had; he really In
tended to get It before he left, but he
poured out his plans first, almost in a
breath.
"What do you think. of it. Judge?" he
asked, after the first pause, when' the
Judge had just finished telling him that It
looked feasible. "Don't you think it will
go? Everybody's got to die, " and every
one wants a nice funeral? What do they
join lodges for if they don't? Wept
the use of the man's money; we. get the
profits on funeral expenses before they
are Incurred. We could Issue ten, twen
ty and twenty-five year policies, and with
a certificate on him a man could move
anywhere, and be sure of a good funeral.
Say, Judge, won't you take holt. of this?
It's a big thing, Judge; a mighty big
thing. WhaJ. cay. Judge? Is it a go?"
They talked until the gloaming fell, and
walked home in the sunset glow, stopping
for half .an hour at the parting of their
ways to go over again the elaborated
sent me.
Captain Meyers,' who always came. In
through the back door â of his -house,
brought a load of wood in his arms this
evening as a flag of truce. He wanted
to make peace with his wife before she
asked about the afternoon's collections.'
Mattie was "laying" the supper .table
as he entered the kitchen , door, and bis
wife was busy over the stove. He spoke
as he laid down the wood.
"Ma, > Tve had a good talk with Judge
Blair this afternoon; him and me stopped
down there at Nichols' corner a few
minutes and that's what made me late."

mother, that he was busy and would
not be home to dinner. He forgot all
about the- undertaker's trust that day
as he walked listlessly from one loaf

trying to get away from the dread of
going home empty-handed at nightfall.

him at the thought of going home on

them, end from the distance the faint,
dear note of a hunting-horn.
"Turn to me."
The lovely head was bent very low.
Her little gloved hand lay upon the
narrow window ledtre. He laid his own
gently upon it. The two hands were
â¢baking like twin leaves In the breeze.
Hers was not drawn away. After a
pause, neither knew how long, he felt
the warm fingers turn and clasp them
selves tremulously about his own. At
last she looked up bravely and met his
eyes. The horn was wound again-
nearer.
"All the cold was gone from the snows
âlong ago," she said.
"My beautiful!" he whispered; it was
all he could say. "My beautiful:" But
she clutched his arm. startled.
"Ware the road!" A wild halloo
sounded ahead. The horn wound loudly.
"'Ware the road!" There sprang up out
of the r.ight a flying thunder of hoof
beats. The gentlemen riding idly In
front of the coach scattered to the hedge
sides; and. with drawn swords flashing
in the moon, a party of horsemen
charged jdown the highway, their ' cries
blasting the night.
"Barber! Kill the barber!" they
screamed. "Barber! Kill the barber!"
Beaucaire had but time to draw his
tword when they were upon him.
"A moi!"' his voice rang out clearly
as he rose in his stirrups. "A mol, Fran
cois. Louis. Eercuin! A mol, Francois!"
The cavaliers came straight at him.
He parried the thrust of the first, but
l be *hock of the collision hurled his horse
again&i the side of the coach.
"Sacred swine!" he cried bitterly. "To
'endanger a lady, to make this brawl in
a lady's presence! Drive on!" he shouted.
"No!" cried Lady Mary.
The Frenchman's assailants were
masked, but they were not highwaymen.
"Barber! Barber!" they shouted hoarsely,
and closed in on him in a circle.
"See how he use his steel!" laughed
M. Beaucalre, as his point passed through
a tawdry waistcoat. For a moment be
cut through the ring and cleared the
space about him, and Lady Mary saw
his face shining in the moonlight. "Ca
naille!" he hissed, as his horse sank
beneath him; and. though guarding his
head from the rain of blows from above,
he managed to drag: headlong from hia
saddle the man who had hamstrung the
poor brute. The fellow came suddenly
to the ground and lay there.
"Is it nut a compliment," said a heavy
voice, "to bring six large men to sub
due monsieur?"
"Oh. you are there, my frien'! In tho
rearâ a little in the rear, I think. Ha,
ha!"
The Frenchman's play with his weapon
was a revelation of skill, the more ex
traordinary as lie held in his hand only
a light cress sword. But the ring closed
about him, and his keen defense could
not avail him for more than a few mo
ments. Lady Mary's outriders, the gal
lants of her escort, rode vs close to the
coach and encircled It. not interfering.
"Sir Hugh Guilford!" cried Lady Mary
wildly, "if you will not help him. give*
me your sword!" She would have leaped
to the ground, but Sir Hugh held the
door.
"Sit quiet, madam." he said to her;
then, to the man on the box. "Drive on."
"If he does, I'll kill him!" she said
fiercely. "Ah. what cowards! Will you
f.ee the Duke murdered?"
*Tfce Duke!" laughed Guilford. "They
will not kill him, unlessâ be easy, dear
madam, 'twill bs explained. Gad's life!*"
he mutterid to Molyneux. " "Twere time
the varlet had his lashing! D'ye hear
her?"
"Barber or no barber," answered Moly
neux. "I wish I had warned him. He
lights as few gentlemen could. Ahâ ah!
Look at that! 'TLs a shame!"
On foot, his hat gone, his white coat
t-adly rent and cashed, flecked, too, with
red. M. Beaucaire, wary, alert, brilliant,
seemed to transform himself into a dozen
fencing-masters; and, though his skill ap
peared to lie in delicacy and quickness,
his play being continually with the point,
sheer strength failed to beat him down.
The young man was laughing like a child.
"Believe me," tald Molyneux. "he's no
barber! No. and never was!"
For a moment there was even a chance
that M.' Beaucairo might have. the best
of It. Two of his adversaries were pros
trate, more than one were groaning, and
the Indomitable Frenchman had actually
almost beat off the ruffians, when, by a
trick, he was overcome. One of them,
dismounting, ran in suddenly from be
hind, and seized his blade in a thick
leather gauntlet. Before Beaucaire could
disengage the weapon, two others threw
themselves 'from their horses^ and hurled
him to the earth. "A mol! A mol. Fran
cois!" he cried as he' went down, his
eword in fragments, - but his voice un
broken and clear. . " ,
"Shame!" muttered one or two of the
gentlemen about the coach: â¢
"Twas dastardly to take him so," said
Monsieur Beaucaire
Molyneux. "Whatever his deservlngs,
I'm nigh of a mind to offer him a rescue
in the Duke's face." ,
"Truss, him up. lads,", said the heavy
Voice. "Clear the way in' front of the
coach. There 6lt those whom we avenge
upon a presumptuous lackey. Now;
Whiff en, you have a . fair audience; lay
on and bast* nlm."
Two men beran to drag M. Beaucaire
toward a great oak by the roadside. An
other took from his saddle a heavy whip
with three thongs.
"A mol. Francois !"
There was borne on the breeze an an
swerâ"Monseigneur! Monselgneur!" The'
cry grew louder suddenly. The clatter
of hoofs urged to an anguish of speed
sounded, on tho night. M. Beaucalre' s
servants had lagged sorely behind, but
they made up for It now. Almost be
fore the noise of their own steeds they
came riding down the moonlit aisle be
tween the mists. Chosen men, these ser
vants of Beaucaire, and like a thunder
bolt they fell upon the astounded cav
aliers.
"Chateaurien 1 Chateaurien!" they
shouted, and smote so swiftly that,
through lack of time, they showed no
proper Judgment, discriminating nothing
between non-combatants and their mas
ter's foes. They charged first Into the
group about M. Beaucaire, and broke
and routed it utterly. Two :of them
leaped to the young man's side, while
the other four; swerving, scarce losing
the momentum of their onset, bore on
upon the gentlemen near the coachj-who
went down beneath the fierceness of tho
onslaught, cursing manfully. -
"Our Just deserts," 6aid Mr. Molyneux,
his mouth full of dust and philosophy.
5 Sir Hugh Guilford's horse fell with him,
being literally -ridden over, and the
baronet's leg was 'pinned under the sad
dle. In less than ten minutes from the
first attack on M. Beauraire. the attack-
Ing party had fled in disorder. . and the
patrician non-combatants, choking with
expletives, consumed with wrath, were
prisoners, disarmed by tho Frenchman's
lackeys.
Guilford's ' discomfiture had freed ' the
doors of the coach; so it was that when .
M. Beaucalre, struggling to rise, assisted
by his servants, threw out one hand to
balance himself, he found It seized be
tween two small, cold palms, and he .
looked into two warm, dilating eyes, â¢ that
were doubly beautiful because : of the
fright and rage that found room In
them, too.
M. le Due do Chateaurien sprang to
his feet without the aid of. his lackeys, â¢
and â¢ bowed low before Lady Mary.
"I make ten thousan' apology to be
the cause of such a melee in your pres
ence," he said; and* then, turning to
Francois, he spoke,in French :V "Ah; thoiiv

He bowed, offering hl& - hand to.-her'
to conduct her to, the coach, where Moly-Â«"
neux and - his companions, having 'drawn
Sir Hugh from under his' horse.' were
engaged In reviving and reassuring
Lady Rtllerton, who had fainted. But
Lady Mary stayed Beaucairo with a ges

were. , V. .
"Monseigneur!" 'she said, with ;Â«, note

tender that he started with * happiness.
His movement brought him a hot' spasm
of pain, and he clapped his hand to a
red stain on his waistcoat. :' r *
"You are hurt!" ;
"It Is nothing," smiled M. Beaucalre.
Then, that she might noVsee ' the ' stain

She stepped quickly into the coach,
and was gathering her skirts to* make
room for the Frenchman, when a heavy
voice spoke from 'the shadows of tho
tree by the wayside.
"Lady Mary Carlisle will., no doubt,
listen to a word of counsel on this
point."
'The -Duke, of Winterset rode out Into

Two months ago there came to Bath a
French gambler calling himself Beau
caire. a desperate fellow with the cards
-or dice, and all the men of fashion went
to play, at his lodging, where he won
considerable sums. . He was small, wore
a black wig and mustachio. He had
the insolence to show himself every
where until the Master of Ceremonies
rebuffed him in the pump-room, as you
know, and after that he forbore his
visits to the rooms. Mr. Nash explained
(and was confirmed. _ madam, ; by in
dubitable information) that this Beau
.calre was a man of unspeakable, vile,
low birth, being, in fact, no other than
a lackey .of the French King's Embass
ador, Victor by name,, de Mlrepoix's
barber. ; Although his condition was
known, the hideous impudence of the
â¢fellow did not desert him. and he re
mained in Bath, where none would
speak to him."
t "Is your farrago nigh done, sir?"
""?A/ -few, moments, madam. 'One
evening,, three weeks gone, I observed
a very elegant equipage draw up to
my door,, and the Duke of Chateaurien
was announced. The young man's man
ners were worthy; â according to . the
French acceptance^and 'twere idle to*
deny, him the most monstrous assur

traveling f or^- pleasure. He had â¢ taken
lodgings in Bath for a season, he said,
and called: at once Uo pay his respects
to. me. -His tone was so candidâ ln
truth, I am the simplest of men, very
easily ; gulledâ and his stroke so bold,
that I did' not for one moment suspect
him; i and Â«. to â¢? /poignant regret
though In - the . humblest spirit I have
shown myself eager to atone^ â that very
evening I had the shame of presenting
him to yourself."
/"The shame,'* sir!"

at Chateaurien at their next meeting,
and identified him with the missing
Beaucalre beyond the faintest doubt.
Overcome with indignation, he Imme
diately proclaimed the impostor. Out
of regard to me, .he -Id not charge him

took "poor Sir Hugh, there, and theso
other gentlemen aside, and told them
my news. Wo narrowly observed this
man. and were shocked at our simplic
ity in not having discovered him before.
These are men of honor and cool judg
ment, madam. Mr. Molyneux had acted
for him in the affair of Captain Badger,
and was strongly prejudiced in his
'favor; but Mr. Molyneux. Sir Hugh. Mr.
Bantison. every one of them, in short,
recognized him. In spite of .his smooth
face and his light hair, the adventurer .
Beaucalre r/as writ upon him amazlns
plain. Look at him. madam. If he will
dare the inspection. You saw this
Beaucaire well, the day of his expul
sion from the rooms. Is not this he?"
M. Beaucaire stepped close to her.
Her pale face twitched.
"Look!" he said.
"Oh, oh!" she whispered with a dry
throat,, and fell back in the carriage.
"Is It so?" cried the Duke.
"1 do not know â I â cannot tell."
"One moment more. I begged^ these
gentlemen to allow me to wipe out the
Insult I had unhappily offered to Bath,
but particularly to you. They agreed
not to forestall me or to interfere. I
left Sir John Wimpledon's early, and
arranged to give the sorry rascal a
lashing under your own eyes, a satis
faction due the lady into whose pres
ence he had dared to force himself."
" " 'Noblesse oblige'?" said M. Beau
caire in a tone of gentle Inquiry.
"And now, madam." said the Duke,
"I will detain you not one second long
er. 1^ plead the good purpose of my In
tentions, begging you to believe that
the desire to avenge a hateful outrage,
next to the wish to serve you. forms
the dearest motive In the heart of Win

. "Bravo!" cried Beaucalre softly.
Lady Mary leaned toward him, a
thriving terror in her eyes. "It 13

"Monsieur should not have been born
â¢o high. He could have made littlo

"You mean It is false?" she cried
breathlessly.
"'Od's blood, is she not convinced?"
broke out Mr. Bantison. "Fellow, were
you not the Embassador's barber?"
"It is all falser' she whispered.
"The mes' fine art, mademoiselle. How
long you think It take M. de Winterset
to learn that speech after he write it
out? It Is a mix of what is true and
the mos' chaste ar^t. Monsieur fcas be

enjoy that more than the wars. Ha.

Mr., Bantison burst Into a roar of
laughter. "Do French gentlemen fight
lackeys? Ho, ho, ho! A pretty country.
We English do as was done to-night,
have our servants beat them."
"And attend ourselves." added M.
Beaucaire. looking at the Duke, "some
what in the background? But, pardon."
he mocked, "that remind" me. Fran
cois, return to Mr. Bantison and these
gentlemen their weapons."
"Will you answer a question?" said
Molyneux mildly.
*;Oh. with pleasure, monsieur."
"Were. you ever a barber?"
"No, monsieur," laughed the young
man.
"Pah!" exclaimed Bantison. "Let mÂ«
question him. Now, fellow, a confes
sion may save you from jalL Do you
deny you are Beaucalre?"
"Deny to a such judge?" * ,
"Ha!" said Bantison. "What more do
you want, Molyneux? Fellow, do you
deny that you came to London In the
Embassador's suite?"
"No. I do not deny.**
. "He admits it! Didn't you come as
his barber?**.
"Yes. my frien*. as his barber."
Lady Mary cried out faintly, and,
shuddering, put both hands over her
eyes.
"I'm sorry."" said Molyneux. , "You
fight like a- gentleman."
"I thank you. monsieur."
"You called yourself BeaucalreT*. -
"Yes, monsieur." He was swaying. to

"Assist Sir Hugh into my carriage."
said Lady Mary.
"Fatfewell, mademoiselle!" M. Beau
calre's voice was very faint. Hl3 eyes
were fixed upon her face. She did not
look toward him.
' They were propping Sir Hugh on the
cushions. The Duke rode up close to
Beaucalre, but Francois seized hl3
bridle fiercely, and forced the horsa
back on Its haunches.
-; "The man's . servants worship him,"
said* Molyneux.
"Curse your Insolence!" exclaimed the
Duke. "How much am I to bear from
thl3 varlet and his varlets? Beaucalre.'
if you have not left Bath by to-morrow

"I shall beâ ln the â Assembly â Room

The door of the coach closed with a
slam.
"Mademoiselleâ fare â well!"
"Drive" op!" said Lady Mary.
M. Beaucaire followed the carr!agÂ«
with his eyes. As the noise of tha
wheels and the hoof-beats of the ac
companying cavalcale grew fainter in
the' distance the handkerchief he had
held against hl3 : side dropped into the
white dust, a heavy red splotch.

(Concluded Next Sunday.) ,Children and the Art of dressing
Them
IT AU. happened at a tea.
My idtji, I mean,
i r think it was the first small tea of
the reason, but in some respects it
was the nest amusing function
which 1 have attended in many years.
And the reason was simply this:
.All the young matrons of the last five
years were there, and baby talk prevailed
âtill at last the unmarried ones had to
1 iH their hands to their cars and beg for
mercy.
Gradually, however, the standard of the
ci livers nt ion "<vas raised from the topic
<jÂ£ the children to that or their clothes;
and at this jioint ray interest was some
vhat enlisted and I began to listen.
1 thought ihat possibly me subject of
young girls' dresses might be an interest
ing oneâ possiWy as interesting as the
fashionable garments of the women of
society.
"I always dress my baby in white
la-cvn," declared one of our wealthy young
matrons.
**Oh. I don't."' exclaimed another; "mine
always wears creepers, and can have a
g-ood lime playing in the dirt."
"How do you dress your little girl, Mrs.
H.?" ask<o one.
I became myre and more Interested then
and really waited -with something like
eagerness for the answer, because I knew
that Mrs. H. is a woman of good sense,
ami g-ood judgment.
"But. " the answered, "my baby is no
longer a I aby. fche is a 'little girl,' and
has already begun lc go to school."
This announcement made the topic in
h'tnd net! more interesting- than before.
The fact that baby dresses, which might
| be as dainty and elaborate as possible,
had been put aside, and real dresses were
ujider consideration proved of the great
est interest to the young mothers.
. Naturally they asked eagerly for ideas
'about school dresses. But Mrs. H. said:
"Simple things are the best for school
giris."
oomehow this suggestion did not seem
tÂ» be greeted with enthusiasm â it ap
peared to close the discussion too ab
rcpilyl By way cf opening it up again,
one very attractive young woman said:
â¢"&& 1 saw such a pretty little dress at
Ma-giiir.'s the other day, and when my
little girl is elder 1 w ant her to have one
just 'like it."
From the description which she then

.'so much, I should Imagine l:iat It was a
â¢ very elaborate iiffair, indeed.
Gradually 1 learned a great deal about
j baby's raiment, and the gradual develop
ment of it. from the long slips, then to
the -short dresses, and next to the creep
ers, T.hich seem to be such a sensible In
vention. After this comes the miniature
combination suit of bloomers and waist,
\u25a0which prelects delicate dresces from
; much of the unavoidable v.-rar and tear,

child. All this more than compensates
y.or whatever they may lack of dainti
ness of appcarar.ee.
â¢ Until a Istt!e girl reaches the ase of 4
or 3 the matrirna can indulge in every pos
it ibie whim as to the children's dresses.
Nothing is too sweet and pretty for them.
French baby clothes 3re simply ador
able!
* When I v.as m Paris last year one cf
my friends gave me a commission to buy
some baby dresses for her little girl. Al
thiugh 1 was appalled at the limitations
of my own judgment and experience in
buying bab'cs* dresses, I found that all
,J had to do Â«\is to sÂ« to the Grand Mai
son dc Blanc, on the Boulevard dcs Ca
ywcizut, ay-il there were babies' dresses of
pit sorts, kinds and prices, enough to
irakc o::c's head swim.
The hand work was maivelous!
Hand work is such Â« fad nowadays
that nothing would be satisfactory cx
; cept earrr.esjts made and embroidered
and tuclied by hand. Thousands of Utt'e
â¢tucks run by hand ate put on the
tiny Arrests, and beautiful hand embroid
ery ;s -added, to excite the envy and ad-
B::rat:jn of mothers who long to see their
little ones . prettily dressed.
But the cost of these bcuuUful orna
mented irariticnts! It rr.ak.~3 one gasp
to note the fabulous prices which are
p-jt in ;:ar.d embroidery.
Therefore I venture to advise mothers
t."J:o with to j>*>c their small children clad
1r hand-embroidered dresses to take

lessons in embroideryâ unless, Indeed,
they are already proficient In the^artâ
and to make the little dresses at home.
It is very pretty workâ no fancy won.
is prettierâ and is very easy. Like many
other things it is very simple when one
knows how. V
A plain little dress with a hand-em
broidered yoke is very sweet and simple,
and is easily made at home. \u25a0
But when the time comes . to . go to
schooi. from six to twelve years of age,
then the little girls' dresses Involve eerl
ous thought. My friend, Mrs. . 11., in
whose judgment I had greM confidence,
very wisely, as it seemed to me, warned
all the young mothers against the pos
sible error of ovet dressing school girls.
She still urjred simplicity In dress.
AH this conversation excited ray cur
iosity, and decided me to look up the
subject of the -fashions for young girls',
dresses, and I find that Dame Fashion
has not overlooked this department. On
the contrary, the different 'fpÂ«h*r* '^re
many and varied. J _ _
Like the styles of the:r mothers or old
er sisters, the sleeves of tL2 : children's
dresses must be large at the top and
tiÂ£ht at the wrist, and the skirts must
he full or gorid. In short, they follow
in those particulars the fashions of all
the women's dresses of the day. Prob
ably the best style of dress for young
school girls is a pretty dark blue serge
sailer suit, which is comfortable, and
warm enough, and always looks neat.
Besides, it admits of the "more or less
rough usage incident to play time. -
The Russian blouse suit is also at
tractive and pretty. It is very simple,
but usually very becoming 1 to all chil
dren. The straight lines of it, together
with a long-waistcd belt effect, give
this kind of suit a very "stylish appear
ance. It can be made or bought In
different materials?, but for winter wear
blue serge eeems the most sensible. If,
however, serge may prove ~to be too
warm for some children, heavy linen
or duck can be substituted. '
Aprons are no longer', worn now â
more's the pity, for they . were "moth
er's delight." And so it results that
when a child gets home from school
the tirst thing Tor her to do is to
change her school dress for a play
dress. A play dress. It is' needless to
*a>'. must be madu of some material
that will stand rough usage and a lot
of wear and tear â like g-insrham, which
is not only strong-, but neat and pretty.
Of course it 'Is most important to
cultivate in all children, boys ;is' \vell
as girls, habits of neatness and order,
but still they should be permitted one
But it's a pity sonÂ« one doesn't poke
de teacher in do nose,. He's do mug
what ifhould get tirty days in jail. No
Senator from" NewÂ» York! Me son, we
has two of de finest. Dcy is ctit out
for team woik; one of 'cm \u25a0never made
a speech in his life, and de oÂ«lÂ«ier never
made iinyt'ug: clpe. Can you beat 'cm?"
. If it wasn't dat. I haa such a -good
job where I am I'd g-o to dat â¢ school
and teach dat frameâ political", 'con
oiny. I know politics; I know dat it' is
a trade dat is governed like cyiry
odder trade or commerce, dat it is jjov
jerncd by de law of, supply and' be
damned. Where a ffood 13
called for dere Ls a good supply; of 'em
Â«v hand; \rliere only a second-rate
article is wanted, of course de. supply
pets a bit moldy and frazzled. . But
New York? .What? We wants dc best
In de market and we gets it.
I tells me son sometingr like Â«Ms, and
yet he Is woozy on, de proposition, for
he suye dat de same teacher told de
big- boys dat Senators should>epresent
all de people of do Stages. '.*
On de level, did ;(ou ever hear such
rot like dat? One of our Senators rep
resents de railroads and de odder de ex
press companies.*' 1 Isn't dey better, dan
dc people? Has de people, afiy rail
roads for to be took care (of? Has dey
any express graft to be keptin;order?
What right have de people to butt In
and try to get a Senator?- I tell you,
boss, dat dis matter is governed by de
law of supply and bedamned,- and you
can't get away from dat. If de people
had a supply of ! railroads or express
companies tucked away In- deir- Jean*
pockets, den it wquld be time for dem
to set up a holler for a Senator or two;!
but while dey has only a supply of hot
air. where do dey come in on de propo
sition? '^' *
But it isn't 'dat.de teacher teaches de
Uids such foolishness dat I gets ; grouty
âit's because dey teaches anyting about
d.c matter at all.
Listen: You can't keep your Uncle

hat,, to say nothing of two er three
. changes of shoes. *
The nicest coat for girls that I have
seen this 'year is the English red walk-
Ing coat. This coat is made of heavy
red cloth, and the cut of it Is very
'stylish In appearance, as it is In the
fashionable. English style. The skirt Is
tailor made, straight and well fitting.
An illustration shows one of these
coats, and with it a red felt hat, match
ing the. coat, is generally worn. This
hat Is very simple and becoming and
appropriate for school.
For a dressy "or party coat light col
ors are the most attractive, and al
though It may seem somewhat ex
travagant to buy a white cloth coat
for a young girl, still if it can be
afforded It is very prett"y. "
I saw a particuluarly pretty coat of
a mouse color. It was an Imported gar
ment, as was plainly to bÂ« seen from the
careful hand work and shirring on it. On
the collar were bow knots made of
shirred â¢ ribbom
With this elaborate coat was a beauti
ful hat made of white French beaver.
Beaver Is particularly becoming to a
child, as it is so soft and fluffy, _and. a

.French children almost universally are
dressed in \u25a0whiteâ white dre33es, coats.
hats, stockings and shoes. Pari3. how
ever, has the advantage of being- the
cleanest city, in thÂ« -world, and littla
children in Paris rarely seem to be. dirty.
I can hardly think? that a little French
girl would ever dream of making mud
piesâpossibly. In Paris, she would not
find mud enough for the purpose, or per
haps such an amusement would not ap
peal to her. At all events. Parisian chil
dren always seem dainty and clean. I
have heard It said that a French woman
could cross a muddy street -without s.
spot on her shoes. If this Is true, it must
be due to careful training from child
hood.
It seems to me. however, that a e!oeÂ«
acquaintance with mothar earth Is
healthful and good, and I believe la let
- ting children play out of doors, even If
they do get themselves dirty In their
games. But, of course, . they should bÂ«
dressed with a view tt> that possibility.
I went the other day to & dancing class
of young children, and It was certainly
a pretty sight. There were children therÂ»
of all . si^es. and dressed In all styles.
One little girl that attracted my atten
tion wore a white muslin dress, with a
long waisted effect, and had a large botw
on one side of her head. The pretty pink
sash around her waist seemed a ridicu
lously short distance from her knees, and
below It were some tmy flounces and
lace. She wore little white stockings and
shoes, and altogether she was a vision
of fluffy daintiness. â¢
yThen came a. little ten-year-eld girl,
wearing a white serge sailor suit. She
was dancing with a little chap who was
also dressed In a white serge sailor suit;
and the little couple made a charming
sight. . i,-;~-
One little girl was dressed In a blue
cashmere suspender suit that was partic
ularly pretty. These suits, particularly
if worn with dainty mousseline gulmps.
are charming. They also make very nice
school dresses when made of dark mate
rial and worn -with plain white waists.
A French dress that I saw on a awe-*
little 'girl of about twelve years of age
was mads of white â¢dimity with a blue
dot in it. The waist buttoned down the
back, and was made with . a collar and
round yokÂ© of all-over open work em
broidery. The yoke was set on a round
strip of the dimity, which was edged
with two flounces, one wide and* one nar
row, of open-work embroidery to match.
Down the 'front of the waist, starting
from the yoke, were two box pleats
trimmed with buttons. The waist was
made -to " blouse over a wide belt.
The sleeves were made with quite
(a full puff at the top. joining a long
cuff. at the elbow, which was made of
tucks and\mbroldery. The skirt was
plain and full, and edged with two
flounces of embroidery edging, one
flounce being wide and the other nar-'
row. like those on the waist.
All-over, embroidery Is very fashionable
for children this year, and It is very ef
fective for coats. A beautiful coat, made'
by Bachwltz, of Paris, was made In the
Empire style and of all-over open-work
embroidery. It buttoned in front with
three handsome buttons. At the top of .
the sleeves were two flounces, giving the
appearance of capes. The sleeves were
full. ; with ._a. cuff at the bottom. It was
made quite short, reaching only a little
above the knee, and about an inch and a
half from the bottom of the dress. The
lining "was a very soft silk.
For a dressy coat, tan cloth la a very

Autumn. is the season of harvesting
and while the farmers are stacking
their corn and bringing in the golden
pumpkins we may well ask if a period
of in-gathering, ever comes to us, and.
if lio, what" are the fruits which we
pack away so carefully . in our store
houses. Are we harvesting anything
out of the labors of preceding seasons
besides dollars and pleasure? Have you
any more confidence in your fellow
men, any more faith in God than you
had a year, ago?/ If you have not. may
it not be well to* begin at once to sow
the kind of seed, out of , which those
rich possessions shall fruit by and by?

sage of the autumn. Life is meant to
ripen and mellow to its finish. We can
not count on an unending succession

must do quickly and because we have

NEW YORK, October 21.
IT RS. MARSHALL FIELD has
I \X| Paused on her way home to buy
I some handsome gowns in Paris.
1 JL It is her purpose to .return in
~^tiiaÂ» tor tha holidays, which she hopes to
' â¢alekrata in a good old-fashioned man
ftÂ«T.
*â¢ . Mra. Field's trousseau waÂ» one cf tha
.snost remarkably ever built for a bride
and in *omÂ« ways it was quite the most
boiupUte, for it combined features which
â¢*â¢ aeldom seen in bridal trousseaus. One
â¢atira. outfit was in pink; another was In
lavender; another in purple; * Jther in
iMsltottopa- By an "outfit" Is meant every
thing from tha skin outâ from the dell
'\u25a0*â¢*â¢ pink lingeria to tha wonderful pink
dinner gown.
Thara were several large trunks full
d gowss in black and white. The trous
seau might have been planned for five
er six' different brides, bo- varied are tha
colors and the materials used in Its com
position. It Is both fluffy and tailor-made
âplenty cf both.
To secure this great- variety Chicago's
rich woman ordered her trousseau made
ey different dressmakers, giving, each
ona carte blanche in order -that there
tnlght be no such thing as a repetition of
gowns. This course was advised by 'a
island, who said: "Place your -order with
this dressmaker and that one. Tell each
to go ahead and make half a dozen gowns,
then wait and see the results."
â¢ \u2666'Mrs. Field did as she was counseled
find, her gowns are now the most remark
' able of any of the season. They are
-^\u25a0oted not so much for their simplicity
Is for their lines, which are long and
tralght and Inclined to add to her height.
There ere many Empire gowns and
cloaks. One very handsome dress is
;sade of embroidered eilk mull of the
<*ry finest quality. It is as sheer as
chiffon. It is lined throughout with a
c chiffon lining, which in turn is lined with
taffeta. This is worn with a very deep
'^Dresden s!lk girdle and a fan of Dresden
â¢matches the girdle in tone. Around her
neck there hangs a suiierb German silver
and turquoise necklace, something Ilka
an antique.
Your Choice In Evening: Gonns.
*Evenir:Â« gowns go either to one ex
treme or the other. They are either very
fcjng a:id narrow or short and wide. If
\u25a0you arc not tall you can use the
"long, clinging variety and you can feel
confident that your gown will be in good
taste. It can tw built of some delicate
'evening stuff, and for the purpose there
is nothing any better than the novelty
silk goods that are fine and soft and
es.sy to drape.
If you prefer, you can use an embroid
ered chiffon of heavy weight, which now
comes in quite a deep gray, or you can
get a cheer printed novelty stuff, which
is transparent and which looks very
much like chiffon, yet is tougher and
'more durable. They are making a crepe
chine this year which is most admir
ifcle for evening dresses. It is light and
fhin and inexpensive, and in texture it is
as delicate as crepe. This makes up
charmingly and If trimmed with taffeta
!s as fine a gown as one would want for
evening.
The new evening tones aie pink and bU
vtr. They are immensely becoming and
can be worn en many occasions. Pink
is the Ideal evening color and there 1*
something about it which keeps one from
becoming tired of it. Take a pink whlcb
c is not too bright and make it up prettily,
trimming it with very narrow trimming!
of silver, and you will nave a go^-r
which will wear you for a long time.
One of the lovely new evening dressei
was made of piece lace of the kind which
crimes by the yard at a very moderate
price. The skirt hung rather limp and
w&s cut to fit the hips. In the front It
lay slightly upon the ground and in the
back it dragged in long train fashion. It
was trimmed around the foot with & nar
row ruching of narrow silver stuff, and
there were silver tabs hanging througt
the- lace. Around the neck there was s
irtamlng of silver paE^tmenierie, and
feruund the belt there was a wide silver
girdle.
Evening: Gotvns for Girls.
v fcr young girls the prettiest dress It
Â«^-. round dress. This is cut similar to
Â«ne skirts which' cne wears in the street,
only that it Is fuller and rounder and
more exaggerated in every way. Some of
the new forms are almost grotesque, so
very larjre are they ana so wiae cocs in*
skirt lizr.3 around the, figure. But young
girls can wear these exaggerated skirts
prettily.
"We arc certainly getting back to
tfee war time styles," said a modiste
*&j k<*cs abreast of the times. "Tha
cfjnâs resemble more and more closely
the dress of ISGO and before the'win
ter is out I loÂ«k for a revival of the
ISCO niodeF
"The dres's of 1860, If you will taka
the trouble to look in your camphor
chest, put away In the attic, was mada
without an overskirt. The overskirt
came in much later and went out
Again almost as suddenly as it came in.
But the IS6O mode had a skirt which
was gathered at- the belt. It stood out
equally all around the figure and it was
worn with or without the crinoline.
The bottom of this skirt was trimmed
with a flounce or the entire skirt was
ruffled. Many of the gowns of that
day had no trimming, especially If the
goods showed a figure or a brocade.
"The waist of the 1860 gown par
ticularly reminds one of the waist of
the present day. Studied in the â¢old
paintings it is almost identical. It was
round and slightly Moused and it
hooked either in the middle of tha
front or the middle of the back. But
tons In those days were scarcer than
they are now, and tney were conse
quently dearer and for that reason fewr
of the waists were buttoned. Many of
them were made very tight fitting in
what conforms to our idea of a bodies
in these days.
"The sleeves of the IS6O gown wera
short. They were cut off above the el
bow and the shoulders had big high
puffs. There was a strapping of silk
'around each sleeve to hold it In place
on the arm. The neck was cut very
round or Bquarc, or it was shaped to
a point in the middle of the front and
the middle of the back.
" "Could anything conform more near
ly to tho styles of to-day than those
gowns of fifty years ago. and "could
there be anything more becoming to
the feminine figure than this roundish
girlish shape? It makes a woman
taller and it makes her thinner. It
makes her sweeter, more graceful,
more youthful and prettier In ' every
way. There was never In all the world
a style which conforms so nearly to
all the lines of art without one traca
of exaggeration as the 1860 style."
Evening: Govrna of Set.
It is becoming very fashionable to
make the evening 'gown of net, that
old-fashioned material which has been
so extensively revived. The net gown

turcsln evening gowns and these, if
adapted to <your new dress, will make
It very distinctive. .. ;
A- handsome- evening dress was cut
round inUhe nee!;, and finished with -a
big 1 white ruchlnu". Another beautiful
evening gown was cut with a square
neck. -Around .-. the edge of the neck
there was set one of those thick, heavy
irhlta ruches such as widows wear In
the' front of a 'widow's caps. Another
neck wiUTcut Dutch, just slightly low.
and In the opening there was set a
very elaborate gold arid white ; tulle
ruche; From this It may be observed
that the niching, is the favorite way
to finish the neck of a gown. .
When -it . comes -\u25a0 to siceves there are
ways that are "just \ lovely," as the
modistes will tell .you. One very pretty
sleevb Is cut off just above the elbow.
Here is it finished with a band, of >ilk
and a tulle ruffle one finger wide. Upon
\ the ; band . of silk â¢ there are . silver clasps.
Another vvery pretty evening sleeve has a
band or. cuff of Dresden silk around It,
and upon this cuff tnere are sewed imita
tion 'olnk topazes.
The Kind 'of Gems to Wear.
The use of mock gems upon evening
gowns is \'ery acceptable this year. All
'are wearing them and even the debutante
comes in for her share., I It , is very good
form fpr her to "â¢ wear \u25a0 turquoises, sap
phires, tourmalines, topazes and garnets,
but shÂ«, should not wear emeralds, -dia
monds or rubies, these three being con
sidered the stones for matrons.
Turquoise, ! being of , a lovely shade of
blue and rather . innocent looking, is the
ideal gem for the debutante^ She can
â¢.wear. as many turquoises as she can af
ford and yet be pretty sure of being
within the bounds of good taste. Sne can
wear a belt with a great big turquoise
buckle. \ Around her. neck can hang ,a
string of turquoise and gold beads. In
her Lair can be " turquoise pins and the
same blue stones may adorn her hands.
There are ever bo many little wrinkles
to be learned regarding evening dresses.
For one thing, the hair is now trimmed
with three combs, which should be set in
the back, one above the other. The three
combs are entirely different and should
be decorated with different gems. One
can be of tortoise "shell, one of gold and
one of silver, like the rings upon one's
fingers, they need not. match each other.
Pink and silver undoubtedly will be
the tfveriing styles, but; next to these
colors come blue , "and yellow,* and next
to; them lavender, pale green, with
black and white always in the lead.
Those who like to dress with some atv
tempt at stateliriess can attempt the
oew figured pink satins, which coma to
look like old-fashioned brocadea. They
ire, however, not very heavy in weight
and are capable of being made into
very charming evening gowns. '
A dress of brocade can have a skirt
close around the hips and fitted as far
down almost as the -knees, though not
quite. -The skirt then flares very wide
ly, nnd as one walks there are glimpses
of petticoats of pink chiffon and pink
taffeta underneath. A pink chiffon pet
ticoat, ' lined with pink taffeta, was
worn by a/ very swell London woman,
one of those women who "have the very
newest and latest in dress all the time.
Over this lovely.: conception in pink
' chiffon' thera was worn a heavy pink
brocade.- . - -
Velvet* for Dressy Wear.
The evening velvets are very charm-
Ing, for they are thin and light and
there is something about them which
is very attractive. | Velvet Is always
dressy, and' since it has been reduced
In price it is certainly very desirable.
One does, not feel as extravagantly
dressed as of yore. The shell pink and
cloud pink velvets are lovely and so are
the pale blue tones. They require no
trimming at all, ' and ;if worn with a
wide silk girdle and a handsome dog
collar necklace' are complete with noth
ins: further.

be considered, but it is a fact that a
great many women are cot wearing un
der3leeves at all, but are trusting to a *
pair of pretty arms^and the fact that
short sle-sves are the fashion.
Xc is to be a dressy season, and the
evening gown will sea a great deal of ser
vice. Women who have not worn evening
dress at all. or who hava at most done
so very sparingly, will don tha evening
dress many times this winter, and will
make the fashion an excuse for tha wear
ing of the light fabrics. .
For card parties the fashionable dress
will be the short, round skirt, tha waist
with the modified blouse and sleeves cut
off above the elbow, and the round neck.
The hair will be dressed low. and tha top
of the coiffure will be trimmed with flow
ers. Around the neck will be worn a long
chain to which will be attached a hand
some- cross and the cross will probably
be one of the new fashioned amethyst
crosses which come almost as large as . a
lady's hand. With this evening costuroa
there will ba worn a beautiful wide firdla
of Dresdsn ribbon with purple -figures
scattered over it, and in tha hair there
will be a bunch of purple silk orchids.

ry* s A CLASS, if not as individuals.
f I the woman in industry is there
I I to stay. For good or for evil, the
*â¢ j home body among womankind is
rapidly disappearing. Eve has
eaten of the appleâ shall she therefore
lose her Eden?
There are those -who would have U3 be
lieve soâ that woman's place is in the
home, and that her departure therefrom
is an unmitigated evil. The good brother,
for it is ordinarily a brother who clings
to this belief. Is represented by the hus
band who forbids his wife to join a wo
man's club, the father who hardens his
heart to his daughter's plea for an edu
cation beyond the limits set by law, the
workingman who complains that the
woman by his side is cutting his wages,
and who while he complains cuts off his
own economic nose by forblddmjr his
feminine rival to enter his union and
obtain the union scale.
Even If we were to grant that. in the
main these emphatic brethren are right,
that the natural duty of every woman
Is to be taken care of by some man, the
fact would remain that in many cases
this right and proper state of affairs
fails of realization. There are many, many
women who have neither husband nor
father, nor brother to care for them, ana
who, therefore, enter the industrial worlc
not from choice, but from hard necessity.
Since the brethren aforementioned do not
attempt to deny this fact or to offer us
any practical method of relief from such
a state of affairs, they will surely allow
us to gather up such grains of comfort
as may be found for these unfortunate
ones. And our gleanings may be unex
pectedly large. We shall perhaps find In
the end that the law of compensation
is at work as elsewhere in the develop
ment of- society.
To begin with, we assume that the love
of home, the instinct for home-making,
can be largely trusted to take care of
itself in society at large, so long as that
society endures. The woman in whom
this Instinct is lacking is more to be
pitied than blamed, wherever she Is
found. The cause for her misfortune is
probably to be found in the fact that
the did not learn as a child what home
means. If the Instinct be really dead
within her, society. Is surely none the
worse off. but rather better. If -she spends
her days In the office or behind a counter
rather than in reading novels and relating
gossip.
Taking for granted, then, the fact
that the average woman cherishes and
will continue to cherish the love of the
home In spite of all we are told that
even if this is true it is also true that
the working girl fails to prepare herself
for home-making. But with all rever
ence for the venerable art. it . must
nevertheless be admitted that the one
absolutely essential preparation lies in
the acquisition of something which our
grandmothers called a "knack," and
which under the name of adaptability
has come to be recognized as one of
the chief aims of all education. We
all can recall instances of most admir
able housekeepers; .the best one I ever
knew was among their number, who
"never tried to cook a meal In my life
until after I was married."
It Is by no means entirely the fault
of the working woman that in the
American home this valuable phase of
"preparation for life" is so woefully
lacking. On the other hand, the ten
dency of the modern schools Is strongly
In the direction of an instruction more
valuable because more scientific than
the old rule of the thumb. The girl
whose mother was a good cook too
often knows -no other reason for her
methods than that "mother did it that
way. Nowadays, even the tiny
housewife of the kindergarten learns
not only what to do, but why, in the
preparation of simple dishes and in the
proper choice of foods. And the work
ing girl, even if^ cooking classes, sew
ing classes, etc., do not come her way
during her all too brief . school life,
still has opportunities for these things
in evening clubs and classes such a?
her mother never dreamed of â oppor
tunities that are much more likely to
come her way and which she is much
more likely to embrace' than if she
\u25a0were a timid stay-at-home. There
comes to mind the case of a working
woman who only in iate years "has
been able to give up sewing and scrub-
Ling for other people in'order tb'der
vote herself to keeping house for her
children. The mother, whatever she
may have been in earlierdays, in her
eld age finds wonderful comfort in the
matter of cleanliness and order. The
daughter, who has worked ever since
she was old enough, .probably, at the
age of 11 or 12. is as dainty a creature
us ever smiled at you from the fashion
plate. The evening school, which a
year ago was "as much . fun as -play-
Ing keep house when I' was a- little
girl," has enabled her to talk wisely on
food values, and to act accordingly;
and in the well furnished flat of 'which
she is now the contented* mistress one
may be reasonably sure to find. a clean
table cloth when company comes. : '
Yes, there are compensations! Often
a girl's first real lessons in neatness,
promptness, concentration \u25a0\u25a0'= and self
control are learned when she goes to
work. It is" Interesting to set' how
sometimes among the very poor the
whole appearance of -a family Is
changed as one child after another Is
old enough to lookÂ» for â¢ something to
do. The tidy hair, the trhn. waist, the
gay ribbons blossom all along the line,
until the mother herself feels tbe- force
of good example and sets about mak
ing her home a fit place for these ele
gant and Important beings- to. dweir in.
In short, the working girl often find;*
herself suddenly advanced to a new;
life of self-respect and: independence
and facing new standards- of life which
are sure to react in greater or less'de
gree upon the home from which she
has come/a nd btlU more surely . upon
that which' she will make some day for;

than a generation, it seems almost im
possible to find the woman who! has
initiative enough to be in the field of
competition. Women are just begin
ning to show the courage necessary to
plunge into affairs where there Is a
risk of capital. They will carry on an
enterprise when it is once started, and
they may have new ideas in develop
ing an enterprise, but they seldom
plan a new project or launch a scheme.
They are likely to be creatures, of rou
tine, just as most men areâ the clerks,
the teachers, the industrial workers.
Initiative and the power of grasping a
situation are not found in all men. Those
who have had the training necessary ' to
develop Independence and free action are
the ones who go into business and become
employers. The number of these is com
paratively small; of the number of men
who work for a living the proportion of
employers Is perhaps no greater than
would be the proportion of women em
ployers were all things else equal. But
all things else are unequal, and so the
women who are proving their Initiative
and mental grasp are rarer than the
teeth of the hen. \u25a0
For Instance, it is harder for a woman
to get capital for any undertaking than
it is for a man; she is distrusted as an
Inexperienced person, whereas a man is
trusted until he fails. Her femininity
obtrudes itself r Into any business - situa
tion except those where she Is supposed
to have special prerogatives s-Jteh as mil
linery, dressmaking, art and education.
Again, it: is harder for her to throw^ her
self-Into the , .whirlpool of the modern
capitalistic system; her self-protective in
stinct is stronger than a man's, nor has
&he so much of the gambler in her as the
man has. She is more cautious.
Yet although women as employers may
be- like the snakes of Erin, there is (no
possible reason for her ;contlnufd non
existence in that capacity. If she , once
gets but of- the twopence ha'penny econ
omy of the home where her business
perspective is limited by butcher Ijllls,,
house rents and missionary envelopes,
she will soon acquire a practical knowl
edge of the credit system, the interest
on capital. and the law of wages.-When
ever that development has been reached
she wlll.be able to contemplate compet
itive waste and risk without any tremors
and no doubt she will equip herself
with the deadly Implements of business
warfare.
There is just a possibility that hers is
a case of arrested development and that
this present chaotic regime of the em
ployer is not the environment likely to
bring her into full possession of her
powers. She may, learn the lesson of co
operation and shine fortu suddenly as an
organizer, of industrial and commercial
units. (
Unfortunately at present she has: to
accept the dictum 4.aat her destiny In
the business world is that of the wage
worker," not the , employer.

because she is : in no haste to forego
the sweets of independence her chances
for happiness in marriage, are surely
greater from the fact that she knows
she need not marry simply in order to
be sure of bread and- butter.
After marriage if children come to her,
her place is of course with them! as long
as they are young. But her position will
be Immeasurably more dignified and self
respecting from the consciousness that
she ' is not in the last resort dependent
upon any other human being for her sup
port.. And as ! the children grow more
and' more independent 'of her 'she may
find that she can not only "offer, them bet
ter'advantages,; but can; better help them
from' her .'comradeship '.with them. .-'"
I ' say I this, not ; to frighten â¢ the!, reader
with too flat a declaration, of , belief 'in
the right and duty of every woman :to
be economically .independent. But as I
write I remember : the : families of two
brothers,- who. are : both : working -men.*
In one the mother is also !at : work in
order that her two little daughters may
have the piano, the music lessons the
pretty dresses which : their- father ' alone
could not provide. The* girls, ten and
twelve years old, aret in ; the
paying for these luxuries by; taking into
their own hands a . large share of the
work of the household. : They have '\u25a0 in
addition their school, their Â» muslc^ their
hours for play, ; and this ' leads to a busy
but' a â¢ happy life. The mother feels L the

Heed of Women's
Trade Unions.
IN! America, according to the census
- of : 1900, more than . flveT-y million
- women and : minors are engaged in
industry. Of this;number!;3,223,
94S labor outside the home.": Tak
ing the< women who labor outside the
home, we " may. divide them into' three
classes: First, the women who have to
support themselves; second, the women
with responsibilities; third, the women
who work for pin money*
. In these advanced' days no one de
nies the right of 'women of the nrst
class to ,. become wage earners. Yet
that right, like all other rights and
privileges, must not be considered in
a narrow, personal way, ; but from a
broad, social and economic standpoint.
No human being has any! moral right
to injure the .welfare of others. ;Ac
cepting; this as an ethical- fact, we '\u25a0 see
that women have no right to enter in
dustries in which men are "employed
and lower wages. They. must! enter on
an economic and physical equality. .For
the welfare of the working people de
pends on the scale of wages. If the
wages are high then we have prosper
ity; if the wages are low: then we have
distress. Therefore if women lower the
wage scale they! bring distress to the
families of the working people. We
all have moral obligations to each
other, and -if the women workers are
not fulfilling their obligation they de
serve our censure.
The second class, the -women with
responsibilities, who. not only have to
support ' themselves, but - have others
dependent upon them. The tendency
of these women will be to keep up
wages, and their effort should have the
support of their fellow wage workers.
> The third class, the women who
work for pin money. \u25a0 â¢ Many, girls ' live
at home who do . not- have to. 'support
themselves, and some I married women
work for plnl- money.';!} The economic
wrong, brought: about, by this class is
great; they can offer their labor for
a, mere pittance, and with! their com
petition wages are lowered to. the last
notch. Many of the married ' women
have married with the intention of not
having 1 children; .they are not only an
economic "disgrace, but an ; immoral in
fluence, whose wery' words poison the
air of the' workXroom.-
That women ' to-day are a hindrance
to industrial progress can hardly be
denied by those . familiar - with labor
conditions here in America. The chief
cause of this is our inherited depen
dence, which has been an obstacle in
the path of our industrial, professional
and political progress, "g We have been
deterred" from any systematic and per
sistent effort to 1 better our condition' as
workers because of the feeling. that our
employment is but temporary, from
which â¢ we hope to be released by mar
riage. rM-\ \u25a0':\u25a0'â¢;-'-:
This is true and to a large degree
will continue to be true. . Yet as a
class there can be no ' Question oft our.
position in the Industrial world. Think
then of the need of developing a higher,
ethical altruism, which- shall Inspire us
as temporary workers, ; to guard; not
enly our own interest, but the interests
of the women of the future. The sad
ness of it all is that women do not
comprehend the position they hold In
industry;, do not know that they are
industrial slaves. A few days ago I;
asked some four hundred women, em
ployed, in department stores, to go: to
!the ( State House and protest -against an
amendment* to compel; them to work
nights during- the: month of .December.!
Every "woman ' emphatically said : that if
she should testify against working at
wight she jvould lose her position.
.President Eliot believes that; the
thoroughly organized trade or industry,
represents a monopoly which interferes
with ; free V competition, and that | such
competition Is; the only law "of liberty.
Well.here is an Industrywhich has not
been^ Interfered with by organization,;
yet if -the, workers in that industry
dared to protest against a" law to" close
the .'stores* at night, they would have
liberty jto walk the street looking 5 ; for
employment, and if they did not get
work- they would have the liberty to
starve? .They are liberty loving women!
Employers j say ' that they employ only!
women.who; live', at; home. We know
why. .Because! sue.v women will work
lor three or four dollars a week; .not
tnough to give them clothes, food 1 and;
a" shelter,', and their parents have; to
supply the remainder. Just think \ (of
the condition of ; things when ! the em- j
ployer insists that out of .their, earnings;
the : workingman ; must partly support
his employers. % â¢
Charitable societies are giving aid to!
families, in, which several members are"
at work. But ; why, you may ask, is
aid : given to); people who are; at work. ,
â¢Because the wages are so. small that, the
families cannot rive on them. ; Why should !
alms \u25a0 be;glveri^ in , 'the name of ? charity.

WHY is equal work for equal pay
not recognized whÂ«n the la
borers working side by aide
are a man and a woman? The
old-fashioned answer was be
cause the man is the supporter of the
woman, . who Is therefore dependent.
That answer held good until a quarter of
a century ago, when the new order was
established, .which is Just beginning to be
felt economically. To-day only , one-half
of the population believe " itâ the men.
It is still \ true that woman's work is
paid less* than that . of ' a man. because
woman has not yet set a ..commercial
value on her time. She is not fully con
scious of her position as part of the in
dustrial world and her relation to 'it has
not been sharply defined.
But the reasons why;* woman working
to-day as teacher, as stenographer, in
the store or factory, receives -such a low
wage are so complex that it is difficult
to state them without entering into a
long explanation! . Four and ; f bur-tenthÂ«
per cent of the total wage earning popu
lation'of the United States are Women,
,whlch!ls an increase of. nearly 25 per cent
hr the total female population during the
last ';ten years.; , During" r 'that ' time- the
average' income of a woman i has risen
from $273 per year to $280, as," against J513
for a man, 1 his increase- only being a few
cents during the decade. This is a large
Increase, though not*proportiqriate-to the
increased ' number- of *women -workers. ."\u25a0
In- the Government; Investigation made
in 118961 1896, -known as>a ."good year,", it wu
found f that the average â¢ weekly wage of
the : woman was ?5. ' No ; statistics have
been gathered lately, so "that figures must
be taken as only representing a part, not
the whole,- of *the^" question," but it Is safe
to say. that- any increase that .women
have gained has been due to their own
efforts by. organization among - them
selves. . _'.'.- . -' â¢ * vV-'X^"
>-The Industries in .which women receive
the S highest annual wage are | the boot
and shoe and the "cotton, where they earn
on | the average from |300 to $400 per year,
and the woolen and â¢ hosiery, where the
average is - between .1250 and , J3OO. This
income - hardly* seems sufficient for the
woman to clothe and feed herself, and it
must be remembered' that the figures are
the average, not the â¢ exception/ where
piecework : or the union scale has caused
the wage to] rise.
\u25a0 Roughly, speaking, there. are three rea
sons'given' as objections why a woman's
wage should be - so . low. First, because
of the unstable. nature of her length of
service, ; where * she -enters "'a* work as a
temporary ..employe"', to help* the family
over a \u25a0 hard time ' or; for:, what is termed
. "pin-money" : ;- seconds her t physical ina
bility; to stand-, the long strain of years
of ;' hard ':- regular , work, ' and third, the
marriage 'equation. " :';-,v " ..^
.Women as wage ; earners are in . the
transion period. "The effect! of organiza
tion and popular education and the open
; ing up tof new avenues of industrial op
portunity have so changed the conditions
;of labor that what was . true yesterday is
* not true' to-day. . . : . .
'More and more women enter, the indus
>: trials field . with the purpose of leading an
independent,' economic" life,. and it is not
In the lyast exceptional to, hear, a woman
say that 'she has worked eighteen - years
at her.trade.' There are a large majority,
however, who only -expect" to 'work for a
short' time or who work and then lay off,
"to whom the future Is. an -unknown quan
tity. The number; who 'work for pin
money are comparatively small, ' it being
one of , the | exploded | of - yesterday
now^aid away with the "queer old maid"
Iwhtr has served - her day and ; generation.
!,The # question;- of marriage is "one : of the
most prominentat the present 'time where
the* seeming impossibility of harmonizing
the home life and the .wage, earning work
presents j itself for solution. The woman
. who has . worked before?, marriage , In a
factory : or shop, who has . attained : some
degree; of economic Â»/ independence and
particularly if ! she has enjoyed the fel
lowship'of a union,", is "loth :to stay, at

I ,\J Japan in such a short spaco
V,' of time and under; like trying
circumstances. Although she has
not' yet recovered from the . effects

most remarkable theix leaders are keen

a bearing on the future welfare of the

great manufacturing people and will, by
the excellent example they are furnish
ing for China, eventually waken that
nation to the need of Western civiliza
tion. It is for the Americans to deter
mine by their enterprise 'just how far
they are to share in the commercial de
velopment of the Orient. V It behooves the
merchants of San Francisco to carefully
study the needs of China, as ether na
tions are doing, and meet thesa needs
with such articles as find a ready mar
ket there." \u25a0 \u25a0\u25a0;\u25a0' .-. .
That is the conclusion of Edward H.
Harriman," who,, as the financial agent of
Jacob Schiff and a coterie of financiers,
directs the affairs of the great Harriraan
system.' of- railroads and incidentally as
sists in', the management of several hun
dred million, dollars of. other interests in
this country ana Mexico. The > railroad
magnate's return from the Far East last
Monday was marked by aVi ocean record
breaking trip on one of his own ships
and an exceptional show of enthusiasm
on his part that actually caused com
ment among the chiefs of his big trans
portation lines, who had assembled hero
to 'welcome him heme.
President Harriman Is known through
out-the country as a. man '.of -few words.-
Brevity lsÂ» also a rule with him in all mat.
tera of correspondence. What he gleans
In the way 'of information . or knowledge
- he generally stores away In his mind and
-'guards it as religiously asa "miser guards

PHis return to. this country Monday,
however, was/marked with' a generosity
of words. He , grave his interviewers, con
siderable of his time, while the other
members of his party' were preparing to
; leave the Siberia, and.'later,^ during the
* trip across the . bay on the tug.- Arabs,
"on his way to the Oakland mole, "where
w his special train was waiting" to carry
him to New York, Mr. Harriman detailed
the many interesting experiences he had
had during his foreign trip and con
cluded with a review of what he had
noted In the Orient that would prove, a
strong Indorsement to a bond issue from
either China or. 1 Japan: ;
Few men of note who have visited
Japan have been afforded a better chance
to' study conditions than Mr. X Harriman.
for, fully appreciating .'the fact that he
represents some of the largest interests
in . this country and as the head *of the
' Pacific Mall Steamship Company arid its
sister, line in the north,; he Is deeply in
terested in the Oriental trade, the bank
ers' associations , and .commercial bodies
of Toklo and -Yokohama joined with the
representatives of the Mikado In giving
their American guest every opportunity
of looking into the trade affairs of the
country. '
â¢'The most disinterested traveler," re
marked Mr.\ Harrlman. as he stood on
the forward deck of the, Arabs, .â¢â¢cannot
fall to note the progress . the Orientals
are making. The Japanese are certainly
a. credit to the world. They have grasped
the modern* idea of civilization In i way
that bodes a revolution of customs In _the
Far -East â¢ China eventually is bound to
follow the course of her, neighbor, who
has shown a willingness to help -her. "At
the outbreak l of - the recent war :it was
Japan's claim ! that the future of all Chi
na depended upon her? making 'a credit
able stand against Russia In order to Jus
tify Japan's adoption of Western civili
sation. It the war failed^the â¢ Japajlese
wise men arKued,.' Chins,; would digcr edit
Western civilization 'aÂ» unfitting for the
Ortenfr/rwhere the people had llved^for

While war between â¢ nations is â¢ to be re
gretted it certainly has been responsible
for t a great change in the Far East. "It
has l brought one of r the smallest nations
in .the 'globe toa' prominent position In
the \u25a0*poria'Â» " affairs and . started the . peo

"You hayÂ» recently/ had a visit from

\u25a0 to 'this -country on -a similar mission.

tneStt'and assistance : from Japan, pro
â¢s<>**\u25a0s.Xof-direct,. her ;own. progress i 'in
the /methods *of : Western j civilization.
The time may not be far off when she
will; devise some means of arousing a
strong national patriotism and organiz
ing her people, as Japan did her sub
jects, with a view of promoting the de
velopment of her great territory, that
abounds with all oa nature's riches. I
learned during my. stay In China that
the" Government has several thousand
students studying .in the schools of
Japan, with the apparent thought of cul
turing them- In modern ideas, and I
have also been told tha.t more of these
students would be sent. to this country
for the same purpose were the laws
here such' that they could travel com
fortably and pursue their studies In our
institutions of learning without fear of
prejudice.'**-^ ;%
Mr. Harriman was disposed to com
ment in ; a - somewhat "serious manner
upon the enterprise that has been
shown by the business- men of Canada
and the mercantile communities of
some of the larger nations of Europe in
their efforts ,to secure business in
China. They go after business in a way
that deeply Impresses the Chinese con
sumer. Their goods are made attrac
tive to the buyer and are advertised
in ways that create a market for them.
Although historically an enterprising
nation, Mr. Harriman is reluctant to
admit, that the American manufactur
ers have shown - any remarkable
amount of enterprise in their efforts to
enjoy-the rapidly increasing frade with
the Orient. Admitting that the trade
with the Orient had increased enor
mously during the past two years, Mr.
Harriman is of the opinion that a lit
tle more energy on the part of the
people of . this country, and especially
of the "West, will insure greater orders
for goods from China and a firmer
hold for the, American merchant in the
Orient.'.', ' :
Although -Mi'. Harriman's visit to the
Orient was a comparatively short one,
he found time to travel as far north as
Port; Arthur, stopping:' over at Dalny,
returning to, Japan by way of Korea,
where he and the members of his party
were tho recipients of -the- highest cour
tesies 1 - that could be extended to on
-untitled foreigner. " Of the future of
Korea' Mr. Harriman was not Inclined
to volunteer an opinion, further than to
suggest that ' its - destiny lies mainly
within the control of Japan.
While- in Tokio he met Vice Minister of
Foreign Affairs Chinda, who discussed
with him the affairs of K6reÂ£, as he had
done 'but a few days before at a meet
ing of the United Chambers of Commerce,
then assembled in the Japanese capital.
The Vice Minister said that the empire's
foreign policy concerning Korea, as well
as Manchuria, had been frequently out
.Hned in public utterances of Its represen-.
tatives, and he. 'added that It was hardly
necessary for him to say that the cardinal
basis of these utterances was the preser
vation,of peace and the maintenance of
Japan's Integrity: Japan, said the Vice
Minister, had acquired certain interests
in Korea, : but : he regretted to say that
several- of the settlements secured by
Japan in -, the neighboring country were
producing nothing but crops of weeds, a
fact that could not be attributed to offi
cial carelessness. , Now that peace wa3
restored it rested with the business men
of Japan to decide whether. the territory
acquired in ' Korea should be used to a
good advantage. "The Government of
Japan had expressed a willingness to con
tribute liberally, toward any reasonable
development plan, provided the merchant
element would : join â¢In the, project. In
this way Japan hopes to advance the In
terests of Korea and force the people
of the latter to a realization that they,
, too, 'have to work If they expect to keep
apace with civilization. "
- Concerning .the recent stories of up
risings In the principal cities 'of \u25a0 Japan
by those opposed to the conditions of the
peace treaty Mr. Harrlman said the tele
graphic accounts must have 'been greatly
exaggerated, for,: while it: ls true /that a
turbulent force In Japan ' has been , mak
ing â¢ demonstrations - against ! the Govern
ment's policy in the matter of the settle
ment of the war, nothing that he had
seen or heard of on that side would sug
gest the, possibility o^ a revolution.; '
.'-That loyalty to tho Emperor," said Mr.
Harriman,* "that provoked so much for
eign comment during; the [ early stages of
the recent : war still prevails : among the
Japanese,' arid I expect to read of, lt as
serting itself In a - remarkable measure
on November 3r3 r when the Emperor ob
serves his birthday. There Is to be a
great celebration, i including royal recep
tions* public y fetes, in^ which all the
notable ; officials '.' of .. the empire /will - par
ticipate, and a special ceremony that -will
commemorate 1 the signing of the peace
treaty with -Russia. â¢' . -"V".
"One 'peculiar; thing that a traveler
nqtlees at present In' Japan Is the out
ward ; friendly feeling shown to the Rus-
Bians, and I really . believe that it \u25a0 is . sin
cere." At the public gatherings. of various
bodies where prominent men ' speak It is
common ;to hear one t *speaker.> after an
other , remark that Russia is now a= friend
of Japan \u25a0 and , that . their interests in the
Far East are practically one. There
seems to be a. united effort upon the part
of the Jai>ahesÂ« to convince Ru3sia tfiat
the spirit, of enmity has been abandoned.
even suggests Itself upon the streets,
where a Russian, who but a few weeks
ago was the avowed ensrr.y of the Japan
ese, now receives a smile from hia former
opponent, and. often they bow and shake
hands."
Naturally the railroad systems of
Japan and China deeply .Interested Mr.
Hafrlman'on his tour, and especially
.those of China. r To railroad construc
tion in China during tho pa3t seven
year 3 he attributes much of that coun
try's progress. It is expected that a*
great deal of railroad construction
work will be started In the various
sections of Japan during the next- two
years. At present one of the serious
problems confronting the Government
officials is concerning the handtics of
the vast army. that is soon, to bÂ«.with
drawn from the flshtlnsr zone, without
interfering to adangsrous degree with
the regular railroad bU3ine33 of the
country. . * *
-While In Tokto Mr. Harrlman gained
much information from the represen
tatives of the Government regarding
the financial affairs of the country. lrt
so far as they were 'affected by tho
heavy drain resultant of the war -with
Russia. He was informed that the
Government, -while not fearing any
great financial embarrassment in con
sequence of the -war. is striving to
enforce economy in the way of admin
istrative expenditures. At the same
time it was realized that the post- *
bellum situation would very liliely de
mand Increased outlays in different di
rections; for example. In the matter of
national armaments.
"The people apparently do not object
to expenditures In that direction,** re
marked Mr. Harrlman, "but they do
Insist that the Government follow its olti
custom of giving equal attention to ih*
conditions of the four divisions of so
ciety, namely. x thÂ« military, the agricul
tural, the commercial and the indus
trial. â It was explained to me that the
people feel that progress In the em
pire cannot bo 1 accpmplished unless
* simultaneous development 13 effected In*
these four branches of society, as they
are pleased to term theta. Thl3 feeltns
of" the people of Japan Is shared by the
officials of the Government and has
been the. subject of special discussions
between many of the prominent men
of . the country. To carry along the
new* burdens that were accumulated in
the preparations for the ."recent war
naturally the resources of the country
have- to be augmented'- and the Gov
ernment has already undertaken this
by endeavoring to Increase the exports,
particularly those of raw silk and cot
ton yarns.
"It was explained by Baron Shlbus
awa that Japan regarded in a very se
rious light the fact that her trade with
China does not yet come within" one
third of America's trade with the same
country, and he has suggested to the
United Chambers of Commerce that
steps should at once be taken to cor
rect this difference in trade through.
Industrial means. Of. Japan's finan
cial condition at this particular time
I doubt if any other country could have
come out of a war in better shape. Ac
cording to the statements of Japan's
Minister of Finance the adjustment of
the country's war expenses after the
troubles of 1594-95 was comparatively
easy, Inasmuch aa no loans were raised
abroad. In the last war. however, ;
Japan Incurred heavy liabilities in
Europe and this country that Involve
the annual payment of 50.000.000 -yen.
This fact does not cause much anxiety
to the Government.'*
A Queer Clock
"Speakins of queer things, the clock

don, where his child lived until she
came to America ten years ago,
has nothing to do with the present
narrative, except as heredity may
have given a trend to our com
posite's character and career.
She asked for die interview in a
note which is a model in its way:
Dear Madam: I read in the papers a
preat deal about the trouble American
lafiles have with their servants. If you
could see me for half an hour, mayl>e
I could tell ;ou some of the raisins why.
Tour obliged servant,
BRIDGET-THEKI^A.
Bridget - Thekla's orthography
leaves something to be desired.
She writes legibly, and I note with
real satisfaction that, although she
is "in place/ her stationery is evi
dently of her own purchasing, and
jiot filched from her mistress' desk.
JJy fellow-housewives will .appre
ciate this point in her favor. "The
\u25a0wise convey it oall,"' said ancient
Pi<tol of professional peculation in
his generation, and the fashion has
not jronc out.
Bridsret-Thekla is goodly to look
upon. Forty years old, as she fear
lessly confesses, her teeth are sound,
her pray eyes clear and her com
plexion, albeit v trifle muddied by
laundry steam and kitchen heat,
bears out the jrcn^ral impression of
cleanliness and wholesomeness pro
duced by her appearance. She wears
a Mack stuff skirt, and, the day be
inff warm for the season, a white
i^hirt waist. A bunch of red pop
pies in her black straw hat is the
one" touch of smartness in her? de
cent attire. Her hands are covered
by gray lisle thread gloves. Alto
gether, she is a buxom, comely fig
ure, as unlike the average Amer
ican ""help" as her modest bearing
is unlike the mixture of "bluff" and
patronage that marks the de
meanor of the aforesaid.
A BETTER UNDERSTANDING
She snys "Thank you, ma'am," in
taking the chair to which I noint in
asking her to sit down. It would
be expecting too much to look for
an old world courtesy, seeing she
has lived in independent America
for a decade. Yet it would not
surprise you if she were to drop the
old-time salutation one sees in ball
rooms, and which is rising into
favor in very "swell" children's
â¢ schools. Perhaps when their mis
tresses set them the example, our
maids may cease to despise this cus
tom of their childhood as evidence
of -"previous state of servitude."
I take the initiative at once to
spare embarrassment:
"So you think that we who write
for the papers are a little hard upon
âmaids ?"
. 1 dare not say "servants," al
though she usetl the word in her
note.
She smiles respectfully:
"I was reading the other day
some pieces the servant girls are
writing â taking up for themselves
like. Maybe they wrote them. It's
as likely, to my way of thinking,
that they were written for them.
There is no good in abusing either
side â as I look at it. If we could
get to understanding and feeling for
jne another, seems to me things
would get straightened out."
"You are right there!" I assent,
emphatically. "The question is
how to get at a right understand
ing. The whole servant question"
â bringing it out boldly â "is such a
hopeless mix."

tollowing manner:
Cook as usual, selecting as young and

beets, then to overflowing with boiling

THE CARE OF BEDS AN D BEDSTEADS
Mary E. Carter
Copyright. 1905. by A. .8. Barnes & Co.
BEDSTEADS and mattresses require
vigilant care to keep them clean
\u25a0 and free from dust or vermin and
protected against spotting of any
sort. The whole character of any house
keeping is unmistakably stamped by the
appearance of the bedsteads and the
mattresses when they are uncovered.
Mattresses once colled -are very ; dif
ficult to clean without taking them
apart. They should never be left un
covered'for any great length of . time,
and when . in '. use ought to have slip
covers of strong muslin that can be re
moved and washed ,\u25a0 periodically. sWhen
they are moved about, ; their covers
should always be left on. It is hardly
necessary to expatiate upon , the tri
fling work of washing these covers as
compared with cleaning the mattresses
when once they get soiled. Their, covers
are also advantageous because they pro
tect them from dust, especialy where it
is difficult to remove in and around' the
tufting. When . not' ao '\u25a0 protected mat
tresses should be swept -monthly .with
a whisk brdom.' and all of the tufts
thoroughly brushed , free '\u25a0-, from .;\u25a0 dust

many have no time to spare for it. Perhaps
the linen deoartments .of the stores would

It. if some one left cards with name and

one to do who knew how to wash blankets
well. "A professional blanket washer!" I

it's the bosses' faults that are talked

The Best and Most Attractive Way to Manage It
Eleanor B. Clapp
Copyright. 1905. by A. E. Barnes & Co.
WHEN a dinner is to begin with
raw oysters or clams, six of
these surrounding a piece of
cut lemon are usually served
on a bed of cracked ice on plates that
come especially for the purpose. The
plate containing this first course must
be set upon a large dinner plate and
placed at each cover Just after the meal
Is announced, but before the guests en
ter the dining room. When the oysters
axe finished, both plates, the oyeter
plate and the dinner plate that was un
derneath it, must be removed. The soup
tureen and a pile of warm soup plates
must then be put before the hostess,
who proceeds to ladle out the soup, the
waitress taking the plates from her as
they are filled and passing them to the
guests.
If wire is to be served at the dinner,
the host now fills the glass of the lady
at his right with sherry or claret or
\u25a0white wine, or whatever wine is to be
used, and then passes it to the gentle
man at her right. This gentleman re
peats the action of his host by helping
the lady at bis right and then filling his
own glass, and co the bottle circulates.
If champagne is used at dinner, it should
never be opened until the fish course.
After the soup plates have been removed
the waitress brings in the fish plates,
which must be warm, and sets them
with the platter of fish before the host,
who carves the fish with a silver fish
knife. The \u25a0waitress stands beside him,
ready to take each plate and pass it to
the guest. Very often, however, this
course Is eerved direct from the kitchen
Instead of being carved on the table, or
various little entrees of fish baked in
scallop shells or In tiny square indi
vidual dishes, each placed on a fish
plate, take its place.
Next to the fish comes the principal
roeat dish of the meal, the roast or
"Joir.t," as our English cousins call it.
The host carves the meat and the maid
passes it and then passes the vegetables
which accompany it, each guest helping
himself from the dish. It is In good
taste for the host to ask the guests to
take a second helping of the meat
course, but they are never asked to par
take twice of soup or fish.
Fashionable Dinner Hours.
After the meat comes the gameâ ln a
simple dinner this can be omitted with
perfect proprietyâ and after this thÂ»
salad and then the dessert, which is al
ways helped Hy the hostess. After the
dessert has been removed. If there is to
be a course of fruit, the maid puts be
fore each person the finger bowls on the
fruit plates. The guests lift the bowl
and doilies from the plate and set them
In front of it while the waitress passes
the dish of frait. Last of all Is -served
the black coffee. Jf the hostess prefers,
however, this can Ikj served In the draw
ing room at the conclusion of the meal.
A very large and fashionable dinner
party, where the service is always a la
Ruese â that is, no carving is done on the
tableâ is given at half-past 7or *> o'clock,
but it is better taste to have a simpler
asd. lees formal affair, such as I have
IM* been describing, at the usual dinner
hour in all our large cities, at half-past
6 or 7 o'clock. A small dinner lasts
about an hour, while an elaborate func-
tion may take anywhere from an hour
and a half to two hours to serve. Guests
should arrive promptly at the time set
for the dinner or five minutes before it.
It is unpardonable to be late. But if
this should happen, it is not customary
to keep the dinner waiting for the tardy
person more than fifteen or twenty min
utes past the appointed hour.
When dinner is ready the maid should
come to the drawing room door and in a
low but distinct voice announoe that
"Dinner is served." The hostess then
leads the way into the dining room, and
the guests follow her, the host coming
last. At a formal dinner each gentle
man offers his arm to the !ady his host
ess has asked him to take out.
Some Shoe Trousseaux
VERT wonderful things. Indeed, are
the trousseaux of to-day. To get
married is not the simple matter
nowadays, in the way of clothes,
that it was In olden times. In many
casesâ those where the young woman's
means are limitedâ it Is made far more
of an undertaking than is necessary.
But for those who can afford to spend
the money for these chestfuls of love
ly things, the preparation is a time
of absorbing interest Each department
of the trousseau is a wonder in itself.
The shoe trousseau, for instance, can
rangeVin money value all the way from
$10 to $200. The latter seems a fabulous
price to pay for one's footwearâ that is,
all at onceâ but it is done, and more
still could be spent.
The $10 layout Is a modest affair, but
quite enough for many a happy little
bride. There are her white wedding
slippers, for which she pays $1.50; her
6treet boots, at $3; her dress boots, at $3,
and her house, or evening, slippers, at
$1.50.
There is a $25 trousseau, as follows:
Wedding slippers, $3.50; dress boots of
patent leather. $5; street boots of kid or
gun-metal calf (the late . style). $4:
two pairs of evening slippers, $S; bou
doir slippers, $1, and carriage boots, $5.
ThesÂ« can be varied In a hundred
ways, till we come to the $200 trousseau.
This is luxuriant Indeed, and my lady
who wears all these boots has a pair for
every hour in the day. First, her wed
ding slippers, $S; patent leather street
boots, patent leather dress Soots,
causkin street boots, kidskln boots
for general wear, kidskin boots
for light wear, each $7 a pair ($35;; six
pairs of evening slippers, to match
various gowns, $26; six pairs of boudoir
bllppcrs of every degree of comfort, $24;
two pairs of carnage boots to go over
the uainty evening wear, $10; riding
boots. Â£tf>; high buckle overshoes (arc
tic*). $2; fix pairs of shoe trees. $6; three
pairs of rubocrs, about $2; six pairs of
fcpat* of various - shades, $9; hunting
boots, $7; skating shoes, $4; golf shoes.
$5; tennis shoes, Â£>, and six pairs of low
shoes (oxfords and pumps), $30. Of
<;ourse. this Includes wear for every sea
son of the year; but suppose the bride
is going abroad -for a wedding trip of
several months or a year, every pair of
shoes is packed away in the trunks
along with all the rest of the luxuriant
finery, to come to light again in Lon
don, Paris. Vienna and dozens of other
places. â¢ ,
Practical Aid And Pictorial
Diversion for Women
WOMEN'S WAYS OF MAKING MONEY-- IN STORES
Cynthia West over Alden
Copyright. 1905. by A. S. Baxnea & Co.
IN THE aggregate, many thousands
of girls and women are employed in
, the department stores which are
features of the life of every Ameri
can city, and which, so far as I know,
have no counterparts in any other coun
try. These stores are much alike in the
different cities, those iri Boston or San
Francisco being run on much, the same
system as those In New York. The help,
masculine or feminine, is kept under tho
strictest discipline. It Las to be.
The first idea of the department store
is to furnish every thing . that any one
can ask for. The second is to. print ad
vertisements of bargains to draw
crowds and religiously- to give what is
promised. The third is to expose goods
freely before miscellaneous jj customers,
relying on the help to prevent stealing
or soiling of articles so exposed. It is
easy to see how any slovenliness in the
matter of discipline would involve great
and continued loss.
Hours on Duty.
The hours are long all through, the
year, and particularly so for a couple of
weeks at the holiday season, when the
demands of shoppers compel keeping
the places open in the evening. The
work involves standing the greater part
of the time, and it Is a severe strain on
the mind and temper; and yet, in spite
of everything, the vast majority of
these girls and women are cheerful,
even happy. They get their wages reg
ularly, only the least valuable ones are
"laid off" in the dull season, and after
store hours their time is their own.
It is the customary thing to put in the
hands of one man the entire control of
the help, the employing and discharg
ing of everybody. He is often assisted
by a trusted woman, who becomes a
sort of matron, looking after the well
being of the girls and "women, and also
keeping a check on them which it would
be impossible for a man to keep.
The floor- walkers, whose place is not
unlike that of a contractor's 'overseer,
or an overseer on a plantation, are men;
with the exception of departments
where women's garments are -fitted.
There a woman has to be employed as
floor-walker. If you ask why men are
used elsewhere, a department store own
er will tell you that It is because the
saleswomen themselves prefer it, and
work much better under male super
vision; that women cannot bear to be
TWO FOREST PLANTS IN THE HOME GARDEN C
OCCASIONALLY one hears of wild
flowers and trees being " trans
planted from their, homes In for
est and field to cultivated' gardens. And
It Is often successful. - However, the
many failures are caused by neglecting
to study the ' natural conditions under
which "the plant grows. 'If '\u25a0 these, can be
substituted, the plants will. grow, sturdy
and cheery ;\u25a0 for what knows better how
to take care of itself . than the, hardy
wild grower, used to battling for itself
from baby seed time to maturity? â¢/
Perhaps . there . are not two ...woodland
friends more familiar than the dogwood
and the mountain laurel.- But Hhey are
seldom seen "domesticated 1 " in*some
body's garden. Yet this has been-done.
and they have proved to be most grace
ful and beautiful additions to the garden,

under the direct control of other women.
I don't know how much there is in the
theory, but it is traditional, and suf
fices to keep a lot of good jobs for the
men."
Behind the counter you will note that
most' of the people are women. So
thoroughly developed is- the depart
ment store " system that the matter of
personal whim In appointments and pro
motions and discharges Is reduced to a
minimum. Nearly every woman there
has begun at the bottom round of the
ladder as a cash girl. She has. helped
but her parents' scanty wages with
$2.50 or $3.50 a week in that capacity."
She has learned to keep herself neat as
a new pin, to be quick, polite, and
careful,' to ; answer every call Instan
taneously. '< handle parcels, get the cor
rect change, and avoid "keeping cus
tomers waiting. - That is' a very Im
portant matter in the long run with
such a store. â¢ .
As' most of its business -is cash,
change has to be made continuously,
and as any flaw in the system would
mean tremendoVs leakage, certain for
malities must be gone' throughâ which,
as' every woman shopper can testify,
are more or less . annoying to the one
who waits. The cash girl who can do
most to keep down this annoyance is
the best cash girl, and will be" booked
for promotion on the first opportunity.
Promotion Slow.
No, she will not get to be a sales
woman at once". .There Is a step in be
tween. She will be made a stock girl.
Her employer's property is thrown Into
disorder by every fresh effort to exhibit
it so as to make a sale. It has to be
folded and put back In order. This is
often a pretty burdensome Job, / es
pecially in the matter of ready-made
cults, dozens of which may be exhibited
to a single prospective purchaser. It
Is the responsibility of the stock girl to
do this and to do" it well. Besides, she
will have to run errands from the stock
room to the salesroom, or from the
workshop, to the salesroom, and make
herself generally useful.
VThtt' habit of orderliness will be tested
in. the stock girl's work. It wlll.be un
fortunate for her if the floor-walker dis
covers that she has put back a suit
creased in the folding or, with dust on it.
She has to be quick, too. for the general
appearance of the department must be
kept satisfactory at all times, and, le-
"very Importantâ these efforts in land
scape gardening need not cost a penny.
XThe mountain* laurel (Kalmla latifolla).
among the '\u25a0 most lovely of flowering
shrubs, Is.; very' hardy: 'It will "grow
a-lmost as well in swarapsas in drier
| locations, and prefers $ partly shaded
situations; but also thrives r weHlrrsunny
. places.". It is an optimist, to b<3 sure! 'It
makes a most .desirable shrub. JSome
tlmes, If the conditions are 'particularly
1 favorable," it will. attain" treelike propor
tions./ ';>'\u25a0 \u25a0\u25a0"-.'.-'.: ': -. -" : .^-'-i-- \u25a0\u25a0 \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0' â¢\u25a0â¢-.'
In the early spring it bears luxuriant
bloom; then all the summer and fall and
winter :its egg-shaped leaves, -always
, fresh and glossy, make charming foliage
effects. â¢ True, bitl is "mountain" laurel ;
'. but "it grown 'in -.hilly- woodlands, and
even has been found hr lowlands, though
in the latter r never i growing beyond \u25a0 a
.' low -bush two feet' high.. Jt loves rocky;
partly shady hillsides: Then there is the
placing must be done as soon as the
effort to sell has ended favorably or
unfavorably. The stock girl gets from
$3.50 to $5 a week.
It is a great promotion when a stock
"girl becomes a saleswoman, or, as the
trade expression runs, a "salesperson."
Now she will have a chance to show
whether she is going to win a prize or
be kept in the lower ranks. She must
develop practical knowledge or psychol
ogy, whether she has ever heard the
word or not. * . ..
Qualities Needed.
No matter how carefully a buyer se
lects his. goods, or how good terms he
makes on the purchase, everything de
pends on the selling of them. The first
characteristic here is lucidity, â¢ putting
everything so' clearly that thelcustomer
cannot help' understanding. Politeness
is important, too. '\u25a0 Shoppers must be
treated courteously, even when one feels
certain that they are merely looking at
things they ( are unable or unwilling to
purchase. ' \u25a0.".â¢' ,
The temper of a girl is brought out.
She must not be annoyed at anything.
She must take even petty insolence as
one of the incidents of the business/and
only pity the bad manners of the cus
tomer. She must be , quick to discover
any; personal whim of" the shopper, to
humor it. She must also have an eye
for colors, and avoid offering what the
complexion of the customer. makes Im
practicable. She must be able, : with
some accuracy, to guess at the , purse
limitations of a serious customer. But
her opportunity has come. If she dis
plays the right qualities, It will not be
long before regular patrons of the store
will begin to pay her the compliment
of waiting till she is at leisure Instead
of accepting '\u25a0, the services ' of some one
else. It "will be the. floor- walker's duty
to notethatifor the benefit of the man
ager. If" the latter Is good-natured, and
happens to -have -the \u25a0\u25a0time, "he will com
pliment the girl on such evidence of her
success. Generally he doesn't. ; The ex

The Troubles of Babyhood Days
One of the Most Frequent is Constipation
Dr. Emelyn L. Coolidge
Copyrisht. 1905. by A. S. Barnes & Co.
yâ SONSTIPATION is one of the
I -most frequent and -most trying
/ troubles to which many infants
(and children) are subject. It may be
caused by-many different things, such
as inheritance, malformation of the rec
tum or other parts, weakness of the in
testinal walls, errors in the food, etc.
The treatment depends on the cause,
and differs a good deal in a nursing or
a bottle-fed baby. If the mother is
nursing her baby and he is constipated,
she should at once look into her own
habits of life and see if the cause does
not lie there. She should take at the
very, least two hours* exercise in the
open air each day; be sure to secure a
movement of her own, bowels every day,
even if she has to take some mild lax
ative. She should drink plenty of pure,
rich milk, cocoa, oatmeal and cornmeal
gruels, water, and take some form of
malt tonic with her meals. . She. should
avoid tea and coffee. Fruit, most green
vegetables and some meat are excellent,
but she should, not eat very abundantly
of starchy foods. - >.
Not Enough Pood.
Sometimes a nursing baby will be con
stipated because he does not get enough
food to form a residue in his Intestines.
If this is the case, he will seldom gain in
weight. Try giving him one>or two
meals per day of modified milk made up
with oatmeal gruel as a substitute for
the same number of meals from the
breast.- \u25a0Be sure to give . him plenty of
pure water between his meals.
. A teaspoonful of cream in a little hot
water, . given Just before nursing, will
often help to make his bowels more reg
ular, or a teaspoohf ui or ; two of beef
juice may be given night and morning.
After the sixth month, a little " orange
or prune juice may also be tried.
A bottle-fed i baby who, is constipated
is'; often) easier, to treat. Add a little
more top milk or cream to each bottle
than tho formula-calls for ; use oatmeal
gruel when *makirig : up the food; if the
milk supply is of the best and purest, do
not pasteurize the food, and never use
lime, water.; but use bicarbonate of soda
Instead. Uine "water is often very con
stipating. Malted food may be added to
each bottle for a short time/
More Heroic Remedies.
When all of .these methods fall, then
other measures f will have to be taken.
Sometimes a very little stimulant -to the
rectum â¢ is all that is â¢> needed." 'Hold the
baby, over a small chamber at* exactly
the same time' and. after a meal every
dayV and insert a small cone of oiled pa
per a* little way into the rectum, or use
a * small castile ; soap suppository. In a
few days after this treatment the bow
els ; will 'of ten ; form a - habt 'of moving
regularly by 5 Giuten sup
positories {will also prove 'of great ben
efit In some cases, but glycerlne'on'es are
too irritating for, frequent use. .
child should (riot be allowed to go
more than twenty- four hours without a
movement:'. An enema of .sweet' oil, one
or;, two " tablespoonfiils, may be given
with' a Vbulb" syringe, or ha!/ a tea-
spoonful of glycerine in an ounce of
warm water or half a pint of warm
soapsuds, but do not give an Injection
every day unless especially ordered by
a doctor.
Massage of the baby's abdomen will
oftsn help. Have your hand warm, be
gin at the right groin and with, your
fingers make a series of circular move
ments lightly at first, and then press-
Ing down deeper as the child grows used
to It; gradually work your way up to
the ribs, then across and down the left
side to the left groin. This should be
repeated twice daily for eight or ten
minutes at a time and always at thÂ»
same time of day. but never directly
after a meal.
A mother may safely give a consti
pated baby from twenty drops to ft
teaspoon! ul of olive oil once or twicÂ«
dally, but do not give castor oil for con

There are numerous drugs and medi
cated suppositories that are used, but
they always should be ordered by a doc
tor for each separate case. Try any or
all of the remedies here suggested before
giving the child drugs that may cause
him to vomit or otherwise upset him.

The Special Shoes
THE shoemaker's Ideas are keep
ing pace- with those of all thÂ«
other manufacturers. The nub-
lie's comfort most be looked
after as well as "style and beauty";
and It well behooves them to do so, for
it Is money In their pocket The shoe
maker has prepared styles for all kinds
of Irregularities In people's feet, and
all the large retail houses have them In
their stock. Not every onÂ© suffering
from enlarged Joints ("bunion" In com
mon parlance), so-called rheumatism.
etc., knows of these comforts. The shoe
specially made for enlarged Joints has a
depressed sole In which the Joint fits,
and Is specially cut so as to bÂ© broad
across the yampi
Many people who think they are suf
fering from rheumatism In tho foot
could correctly attribute the trouble to
a broken or Injured Instep. The remedy
for this broken-down part of the foot
is a shoe with stiff braces of leather
built In the side around the arch of the
foot. In the sole, through the arch or
hollow, is laid a steel plate, riveted to
the sole; and covered, of course, by the
inner sole of the shoe.
Then there are shoes that are wider
here and narrower there, and higher' in
this place and lower in thatâ shoes, in
fact, to fit all kinds of Irregularities that
are not deformities. To the casual ob
server, these shoes are no different In
appearance from the regular shoe. Also,
they are made to follow as nearly as
possible the prevailing styles In . foot
wear. Many a one complains that "My
foot is very hard to fit," and goes about
worrying with a shoe from the stor*
kfeper's regular stock. -NAME PUZZLES

MADNESS OF AMERICANS IN PARIS
It U otlmated Â»hat there are 100.000 American* In Paris nearly all the year round. Between the Majority, -who
are touriat*, and the minority, who really participate in French life, in a strange mob that lives a strange life of
its own a* far removed from sane French life aa from line American life. ! The license of ; the so-called Laltin
quarter has queer effects on Its bobemlan residents who cease to be Americans without becomlnst French.

PARIS, Oct. 28.â What becomes ,^of
Anierleans In Paris? Numbers disappear
annually, so as to cause the utmost
concern ; to their friends at home and
even to Frenchmen, who have the fair
fame of. their country at heart. *. Few
of the cases are brought up before the
police, for they do not result from
b&ttle or murder or sudden death. -The
disappearances are not physical, but
mental, altering people so that their
- best friends think themselves deceived
by a resemblance on meeting them by
accident. In the Paris streets after a
separation of a few . months.
> There are," of course, many, Americans
who are' not afflicted with eccentricity
simply because they -have . comet to
Paris. The tourists who "do" Paris in
three days and return home, knowing
enough about France to stagger the
natives In an argument are far from
being lunatics in any sense of the
â¢ word. Also, the Americans who marry
Into French families of good standing,
or who have friends in this circle help
ing them to know the same class of
people that they would frequent "\u25a0 at
home, remain purely and .charmingly
American. The.Duchesse de la Roche
foucauld, who was M attie Mitchell of
Washington; the Comtesse Bohl : de
Castellane, who was Annie Gould; the
Comtesse de Chambrun, Senator Long
trorth's sister; the Comtesse de Con
stant-Biron, Embassador lxi'shmans
daughter. Martha; and many others
who could be named, have lost- nothing
of their ' American simplicity while ac
quiring the French grace of word and
manner, and are glad to entertain the
Americans who are or were .their real
friends, though they may sometimes be
criticized for- not welcoming all the
stray compatriots who may claim fic
titious acquaintanceship. But as the
tourist element represents the vast ma
jority of Americans coming each" year
to Parish so the element with French
ties of marriage or friendship forms
the infinite minority. Between the
two stand the legions, some poor and
some wealthy, some good' and some
bad, some. . artistically talented - and
some socially ambitious, seeking. study
or amusement, as the case may be, and
the greater part not -only, growing
â¢^inAmerican with startling' rapidity,
but developing traJts which leave se
rious doubts: as to their sanity. \u0084
\u25a0 AMERICAN POPULATION^
Tfceee Americans are divided Into two '
The San Francisco Call.
general sets, the social element, called
the American colony, living ' in .'the
Utoile Quarter, and most frequently
along the Champs-; Elysees, the- Pare
Monceau, the Avenue duÃois de Bou
logne or the Avenue. de T Alma, and
then, the, artistic element,' living In the
fco^oalled Latin Quarter, on the left
side of' -the- Seine. \u25a0 The. two. sets,, mix
little/, and surrounding each are little
cliques which do not mix at all.
No .one has ever- succeeded in . esti
mating even approximately the num
ber; of Americans living in Paris.i Ac
cording t6. the directories there are not
much more than/5000. But old Ameri
can residents place - the figure ; much
higher, and . the : Rev. Dr. Morgan, rec
tor of the American Episcopal Church
of the Avenue de l'Alma, has | expressed
the opinion that there must' be Jiot far
from 100,000 Americans in Parish
Though the forms taken are some
what different, It ' Is in \u25a0 these .two sets,
the social colonyand the artists' quar
ter, that the extraordinary eccentrici
ties break out. The French can'scarce
ly-be held to blame for this, /first be
cause Americans out of one of-.the two
colonies remain perfectly sane,- and sec
ondly because few French people, and
none of any' consequence.. mix In these
colonies,' whose members -generally
learn not a word of French and -.leave
Paris after a. residence of many/years
without knowing any language other
than good American.
SEEING; THE SIGHTS.
But the traditions of the colony are
none the less handed down from gen
eration to generationof passing Amer
icans, who soon think it perfectly
natural to do things which would make
their righteous hair .stand on end If
ever mentioned. in America. It is hard
ly an- exaggeration to'say that one
cannot;- enter" the ; disgraceful Bullier
Ball, or the unmentionable Tour
d" Argent restaurant,' or the notorious
Jlaxlme's, without -meeting -/several
parties of nice American girls.' 'who
know perfectly, well '.where they, are,
but merely I consider ' that . they are I eee
ing thÂ« sights of Paris. Gray-haired
old- ladies {are;. often â¢ with them,' or at
alb events "their fathers.: and "brothers,"
the \u25a0 entire; family.; thinking that /quite
the proper Parisian thing Is beingdone
by going there, \whereas "any">elf-re-.
epectlng ' Frenchman I would ; think ? h[m

death In IDOI there was sent over, to
Germany for bÂ«r $1,945,000 and she left
a fortune amounting to $2,700,000. The
late Princess Alice received $540.000.
The Duke of Edinburgh, the Queen's
second son, received $2,530,000. His
wife brought him $1,950,000 and an in
come of over $55,000 a year. Hesuc
ceeded to the Dukedom of Saxe-Coburg
in 1894. which carried with it a salary
of $150,000 a 'year.' but the British Gov
ernment still continued his annuity of
$50,000 a ;year. and when he died in
1900 settled a pension t>f $30,000 a year
on his rich widow. The Duke of Con
naught, the Queen's third son, ge*3
$125,000 besides his army pay.
'MORE EXPENSIVE RELATIVES.
Princess Christian, the late Queen's
third daughter, receives an annuity of
$30,000 a year from the public treasury
and has already drawn $1,290,000. The
fourth daughter, Princess Louise,. who
married the Duke of Argyll, one of the
wealthiest of Scotch peers, receives a
similar , annuity and has been paid up
to date 51,010,000. The Queen's young
est son, the Duke of Albany, who died
in 18S4, had. received up to that time
$800,000./., His widow was granted $30,-Â«
000 a, year for life and she has already
drawn; s6oo,ooo. Princess Beatrice, the
youngest daughter of the Queen, who
married Prince Henry of Battenbergr,
gets a" similar annuity and thus far it
has netted her $720,000. In respect of
large families the English royal house
sets . a commendable example, but \u25a0 the
nation has had to pay a bis price for
it.. President Roosevelt's numerous
progeny would hardly be so much ad
mired If the taxpayers had to shell out
$30,000 a year to each of them when
they grew up.
The King gets $2,830,000 a year. The
Prince and Princess of .Wales between
them are officially credited with a beg
garly $150,000 a year, but they really
get much more than that.
GREAT PEXSXOX GRABBERS.
Queen Victoria's relatives were great
pension grabbers. Prince Leopold of
Saxe-Coburg. King of . the Belgians,
who had the good fortune' to marry
her aunt, drew . $5,835,000 from the tax
payers of this country before he died
in 1885. The Duke of Cumberland.
King Â«'of Hanover, t an" uncle of the
Queen, received in annuities $5,330,000

Queen's aunt, received $6,000,000 in an
nuities. She died in 1849. Queen Vic

who died in 1861. received $4,483,000.
The Duke of Suslex, an uncle who died
in 1843. received $3,770,000. Another
uncle/ the Duke of Cambridge, who died
in ISSO. obtained $6,680,000. Princess
Augusta.' an aunt, who died in 1840. took
$1,980,000 from the public' â¢ treasury.
Another aunt. Princess Elizabeth, who
died in the same year, received $2,075.

an aunt, drew $3,275,000. Two Prin

be able to claim aslmllar relationship,
drew between them s 35.940,000. The
Duke ! of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, one of
herfcouslns, who died in 1860, received
$551,280. Between them these twelve
relatives of the late Queen drew from
the^ British taxpayers in hard cash the
enormous sum of ; $44,924,280. for the
most part . for. merely condescending to
keeptalive. kill time and enjoy their

Echoes from the Lodge Room
During the first week in October Su
preme Arch James F. Martlnoni, the
highest officer in tv.e United Stales, left
this city on a tour of official "visits'in
Oregon, Washington and' British Co
lumbia. The day of his arrival i:i Port
land, Or., he was received by "a com
mittee of Druids, who eseortÂ«?ti hi;n
over the city and took him over the
fair grounds, but before visiting any
of the groves in that territory he went
to Tacoma, where he officially visited
*"X. P. C." Grove and Schiller Grove in
joint session. There was a large at
tendance and the visiting official, to
gether with Dr. de Bruyne, supreme
deputy arch, witnessed the initiatory
â¢work, conducted fn the German lan
gua.ee. The work was followed by a
banquet in honor of the visitors. Dur
ing his stay in that city the supreme
arch organized a grove to work in the
Italian language. This will be insti
tuted shortly.
The two officers named then went to
Seattle, where the supreme arch se
cured forty names to a petition for a
crove to -work in the Italian language.
This will be instituted by Dr. de Bruyne
on November 8, and those who have al
ready signed will have, they say, 200
members by the close of the year. He
also obtained twenty signatures to a
petition for a charter for a grove, to
work in English.
The supreme arch then visited Vic
toria, B. C. and subsequently Lady
emith, where he attended a. session of
Wellii>g"ton Grove, which is in the main
composed of Scotchmen and Welshmen.
This grove* has in its membership two
past grand arches of the jurisdiction
and the present grand treasurer. The
meeting was attended by a large num

Native Daughters.
The local parlors %>f ' the Native
Daughters of the Golden West are busy
preparing for the official visit of the
grand president, Ariana W. Stirling, to
each during the month of November.
The grand president- is. extremely
pleased at the very cordial and fra
ternal manner In which sue has been
received at every place she has already
visited offlclally. It is her hope tnat
she may, at the end of her term, be
able to say that of every parlor in the
jurisdiction.
'The grand president, on her visits in
the interior, has induced many of the
parlors to start a circulating library in
the locality in which such parlor is lo
cated. \u25a0
A number of tire parlors have inaug
urated whist tournaments for the win
ter months.
The majority of the parlors have
contributed generously to the fund for
the purpose of erecting a monument to
the memory of the late. Tina L. Kane,
whÂ« was the first grand president of
the order. " : ,'*./. , -
The resolutions prepared by the com
mittee of the Gr.and Parlor in memory
of the late Past Grand Presidents Tina
L. Kane and Belle W. Conrad are beau
tiful, not only. in sentiment but in the
engrossment, the latter the work of
Dolly Hyams, a member of Gabrielle
'Parlor. A copy of these is for, the fam
ily of each deceased and one for the
parlor of which each deceased ; was a
member. . ,
Grand Secretary Laura J. Frakes was
trie guest of La \u25a0 Paloma. PaTlor last
Wednesday. It - is, an acknowledged
fact that a visit bythe grand, secretary
to a disheartened parlor gives more en
couragement than anything " that is
known In the order, and that she can
advance "more than- one practical idea
for the purpose of increasing -the de
pleted .treasury of a parlor than any
other member of the association.

one, accompanied with the assertion

When Maestro Salassa no longer
sings â and may that be very longâ he
\u25a0will still have his hands with him, the
most eloquent in the world. One could
more easily imagine, 1 fancy, Salassa
without his head than without his
.hands. 1 had them before me as they
play laso as 1 went to see him the
other morning. I came away after a
trood hour with them with the. wit. of
them dazzling iiie as not all Mr. Salas
sa.'s speech, with the deep, red gold of
the voice thrown in. dazzled* in*. He
.turns an epigram with a thumb, sneers
"with an upturned little finger and
â¢buries a rival fathoms deep in a hol
ipwed palm. Curved, dosed fingers,
like a tall Illy Lud, up pointed," and he
paints *n inhnite pianissimo for > you;
a flat hand, palm down, thumb cruelly
apart, and OteKo's jealousy is aflame.
Little there is that Salassa's hands
cannot say, and. as before said, these
he will nave with him when the voice
is gone. If gesture can.be taught here
is a maestro who could make fame for
any dramatic school, though may it be
long before he should teach.
It was almost the first thing I asked
Salassa the other day â where he had
studied gesture. Count Piccloni oblig
ingly translated. We were at the Tiv
oli; iSal&ssa In a businesslike brown
suit and an inglorious red tie. His big,
barytone roots "beneath tremendous
shoulders one linds and squarely from
them rises the big- head, with its thin,
sweet, supple,' mobile lips; nose like a
larger Dante's; and gray, firm eyes,
behind a pince-nez when off duty.
With upturned palm Salassa simply
squelched my Question.
Count l-'iccloni translated:
"He says he has not anywhere stud
fed; he learned himself only" â not one
word had Salar.sa said.
It was Just here, howover, that I be
came conscious of my exceeding gopd
fortune. Possibly Salassa 16 the only
male matinee idol they have ever had
at the Tivoli. All the ages and sexes
have succumbed to his attractions. The
old ladies adore him; the young ones
dream of him; men leave their smokes
for hitn. Sagely I wondered if the
mystery that surrounds him added to
this. Less, possibly, is known of
Salassa than of any other singer fa
miliar at the Tivoli â possibly because
there is less to know. Fascinating
rumors that between whiles he betakes
himself to a monastery are not un
known, and it is true that out of the
Tivoli doors â no more Salassa. And
there I was with the idol, his barytone
r booming for me alone. There are some
things in life worth living for, I
as I remembered ay the other
girls who would, have given all the
tars they have to be there!
Of course, it was beautifully worth
while just for that. Of course, I should
"enjoy to say" that I found Salassa the
sumptuously intellectual person his lago
siÂ«ms to bespeak him. Of course, I should
like to feel that this sumptuously inti-1
fr-ctual person scintillated for me alone.
But I am a truthful person. Salassa does
not scintillateâ only by way of his hands.
Even in the luminous translation of Pic
cioni the barytone shone quite mildly.
Good-natured, delightfully naive, artless
ly vain, Salassa is charming, indeed, to
me*t. but I should judge his superb
acting a matter as much of instinct as
of intellect. But magnificent instinct!
That he was at home, caring for the
splendid.' voice that has Jas=ted him twen- :
t>'-rix years to the ordinary finger's fif
r-en, and nn at that fascinating monas
tery cf tradition, Salassa told me of his
!etsurpr hoiir'p history.
Turin he comes from. Salassa then in
fcarixi me. At IS he began to Study
s hf;Â«. Po irr>i>rÂ«^ssed was Pedrotti, of
v, houi ax the same time Tamagno was a
pupil, with Halassa's _ volte, that he gave
fcira lessons every morning in addition to
those of the regular conservatory course.
Practically the student was at the Ly
ceum a!l day.
\u25a0â¢Hard work?" I asked.
\u0084"Y>ry hard work," came back in Sa-
lassa's glowing barytone,
Of his first appearance, curiously in an
opora- composed by. Petrella's uncle, "I"
Â«.PtorrieÂ«Â»Kl Sposi." he told me. It was as
/R^derigo. and during the month of pub
lic performances given by the Lyceum
students every year. He laughed hugely
a? he *aid it was a 'terand success."
, Piccioni translated the laughter. "Mr.
Salassa pays to say." he explained, "that
the student performances are given in a
large theater where one pays two, three
and five, francs for seat all the year.
For the students they charge one franc
only, and all is great success. Parents
conn*, to. applaud their little boys and
girls, anfl any one has twenty cents!"
For eight years, longer than any other
native barytone. Salassa sang continu
â¢ ously In his native town. These operas
. he' sang In, and with much success, which
is easily to be believed: "I'Coscritto,"
"Promesst Sposi," "Traviata," "Ballo in :
Maschera.." "Nabucco," "Carmen," "Mig
non," "Gloconda." "II Conte Rosso." "La
Modella," "LaÃeglna di Bcozia,"
In comic opera, comically, Salassa be
gan, as comic opera, in "Falstaff," Is now
his favorite opera. But it was in "I'Cos
critto" that he sang first, as a sergeant
who enlists soldiers In England for
France.
â¢ "What are his farovite roles?" I asked.
"Uno momento." Salassa asked, and I
waited to hear "lago, Falstaff. Barnaba
C'Gioconda") and Tonlo."
â¢The lago Is really your favorite
role?" I asked of its star exponent.
. Yes. it was. he told me again, hands
-^pressing his various delight in the role.
fcSrfe has a voice like that of Maurel, for
whom the role was written, be explained,
"dark," like Maurel's. "For him," be
said. Verdi wrote the opera.' "Just as
this." Piccioni elucidated; "Mr. Verdi
. wrote it, then he say to Mr. Maurel:
'Here is your opera!' " Salassa's bestow
ing hands illustrated: *
How, night after night, he watched
Maurel at the singing, Salassa- told then.
Kow. night after night when he went
home, before a mirror, he reproduced the

if they but take the time to get acquaint
,rt v.nh them, and to catch the messages
ih<>y 'would tell. To do this, men must
bo â¢Â» a receptive mood, if they would
gain " tho 'full message that the painter
socks to tell, or if they would , extract
from the picture the pleasure that It
should impart. To acquire this attitude
tho mind must be freed of prejudices,
and . freed from thoughtless comparisons.
True, comparison is the world's yardstick
for measurement, but it is not a compe
tent standard in art, for by It the point
of view, or the conception, of the artist
,x cannot be arrived at-Â«nd unless you get
painter's viewpoint, you cannot pos

Apropos to this matter of Judging pic
tures, it fell to my lot to be viewing
Giuseppe Cadenasso's pictures on exhibi
tion at Paul Elder's, with some other
visitors, who were unknown to me- other-
Maurel picture, he told. How, at last.
In reverence, he sang it, he recounted.
"Where," I wanted to know then, "had
Mr. Salassa sung?" Why he is not more
Importantly known ha? always puzzled
me. this, of all the "Tivoli singers, that
the Grau people went regularly to hear,
who stands with 'them, who is of them.'
It would take too many minutes, Sa
lassa laughed, to tell of all the places
where he has sungâ "Valparaiso, Monte
video, City of Mexicoâ a great deal in
South America. In Russia, in St. Peters
burg, In Moscow. Italy, of course- 1â"1 â "
"But." I said, "Paris? Berlin? Lon
don?"
"In London, yes." the barytone told me.
"That was very interesting. It was in
'La Regina di Scozia' he sang in London.
The opera was written by a lady, a de
scendant of the Queen of Scots, the one
Mary. She was very rich, and heard
Salassa sing in Turin, and brought him
and a whole company from Turin to Lon
don to present the opera."
"Good?" I asked.
Mr. Salassa's hands damned with much
faint praise. "It ran a week," he added.
But one wonders what would have hap- |
pened had Salassa's lago introduced him
to metropolitan attention.
It was after this that the Falstaff
came ur> again. Flattering, beseeching,
extolling, the hands and the gorgeous
barytone â that seems to roll up from
Salassa's very bootsâ asked me why we
could not have "Falstaff" here. "He is
dreaming for that opera." He Is most
sure that If it were given for once It
would run for many nights. Come c
bella! Come c belia!
"There !s one romance," hands to
heaven, ''Quando ero paggio del Duca di
Norfolk, ero sottile, sottile, sottile, sot

of Norfolk I was so thin, so thin, so thin.

"But the measure of me was taken for
Falstaff when I was before here. Then

put it on for me?"
I Co ask. .If you please. Mr. Leahy,

"BEN HUR" WILL BE
CHIEF ATTRACTION
"Ben-Hur." the b!g spectacle play, will
be the chief attraction at the theaters
this week. The play comes to the Grand
Opera-house to-morrow evening for a
limited engagement of two weeks. The
production promises to be at least as
good as the stupendous affair brought
here two years ago, than which nothing
more ambitious "has j been seen locally.
The "chariot race" scene, which admirers
used to go night after night to see over
again, will, of course attract the usual
attention. The company, is said to be
unusually efficient, the cast;lncluding:.Al
phonse Ethier as Ben-Hur; Julius Me-
Vicker as Messala; Robert McWade as
Simonldes; Dorothy Rossmore as Iras;
Iklabel Mortimer as Esther, and Henry
Weaver as / Sheik Ilderim. Alphonse
Ethier Is the handsome person who won
such favor as the Messala of the first
"Ben-Hur"; and McWade seems to have
made an excellent impression in the dif
ficult-role of Slmonidcs. Mabel Mortimer
is the Esther of the original cast. Indi
cations are for crowded houses this time
as last, when several records were broken
at the Grand Opera-house.
To-day the Grand Opera-house will
have a tucked-In engagement of one day
of "Peggy from Paris," the George Ade
musical comedy. Comes with it Arthur
Deagon, the comedian, Julia WWestt t and
the famous Emmaleen chorus. This will
be the first time the comedy has been
given here, and it is said to be of the
smartest of George Ade's efforts pro
duced in thoroughly smart fashion.
Andrew Mack, at the Columbia will
again be seen to-morrow evening in
"Tom Moore," the Knights of Columbus
being in attendance. Mr. Mack will offer
"The Way to Kenmare,". another Irish
comedy, for the rest of the . week, begin
ning with this . evening's performance.

tell of a. disrupted friendship.
Standing before a fine study of oaks,
hung deep with . mosses, beneath whoso
shadows elfins nightly gambol, the woman
of the party exclaimed: '.'Oh, how lovely!
Isn't that splendid? But don't you think
he imitates Keith?"â which. is the point
whereat a friendship would be in grave
dangerâ but the pain. was saved me, be
ing a stranger.'
"Imitate Keith.V forsooth! and whom,
pray, did Mr. Keith imitate? And whom
did Innes and Corot and Japy and aji the
rest of . thei poet painters' "imitate?"
Why, -they Imitated natureâ they. all saw

WILL BE A TREAT
./FOR MUSIC LOVERS
It is a feast fit for the: gods that
Will Greehbaum spreads *at Lyric, Hall

Not that one needs be grateful to Mr.
Greenbaunv therefor! Actually, the

Bauer conducting the piano, and Heer

Mtftit Carnfalf'x Menagerie.
LONDON, Oct. 28.â Little Miss Car
negie's fondness for pets of all kinds will
In time lead to .the establishment of quite
a menagerie at Skibo Castle. The latest
addition to her collection Is a wolf cub.
It was presented to her by Henry C.
Brooks, a Scotchman living near London,
who has for. some years made a hobby
of taming wolves. Like most Scotchmen,
he is a : devout admirer of Andrew Car
negie. With the cub peacefully following,
him. he appeared at the lodge gates at
Sklbo a : few days ago and asked If he
could seethe laird. The lodgekeeper. who
Is an -ex-London policeman, and was at
one time In charge of a dogs' home here,
eyed Mr. Brooks' four-legged companion
with much curiosity and inquired what
breed ! of dog it was. On being told that
it was not a dog.' but a wolf, the lodge
keeper hastened to summon the nearest
policeman. The policeman decided that
there was no law which justified him in
interfering with a tame wolf. Mr. Brooks
was then allowed to enter the grounds,
but the wolf was detained at the lodge
until the matter had been submitted to
Mr. Carnegie's Judgment. That was. that
the cub should remain at Sklbo, but M!ss
Carnegie will not be allowed to play with
It until Its temper has been thoroughly
tested by the kennel keeper of the estab
lishment.

1920
What formerly was a leisure class is
now the busy classâ and this especially
pertains to the women.
The movement among the leisure class
to busy itself either for revenue or for
philanthropy had its rise in England
about thirty years ago. at the beginning
of the great social movement led by Will
lam Morris and his confreres. And though
the movement to "do .something, if you
occupy space in the world" did not begin
at the top of the social organism, it
reached the top after many years of edu
cation and persistent agitation. It
reached the top of social by
psychological laws, and^ behold the result
âin London no fashionable woman is
without some definite business, be it head
of a hospital, or of a model school, or
leading a band of lace workers, or of a
tewing class, or of some work whereby
humanity is served. 'And there are those.
Lady Warwick, for instance, who go
Into trade for revenue, pure and simple,
with philanthropy as a polite accessory.
Then tbe movement picked itself up,
called over the ocean, and dropped down
in New York and its bourgeoise suburbs.
It did not thrive for a timeâ the women
had not yet been surfeited with the in
toxicants of wealth that were drugging
the air about them. They were dragged
about at the behest of this hostess, or
that, ofttimes for no higher motive than
to be used for stepping stones to social
elevation, and where friendshipâ that rare
and holyÂ» t bond that makes life worth
whileâ was an element wholly unknown
end unrecognized.
Now comes the revolution.
The utter futility and unsatisfying qual
ities of endless teas, luncheons, dinners,
balls and receptions have penetrated Into
"the souls of the best of Eastern women,
an expression of which is the seeking out,
by Mjs. Clarence Mackay. of the nomina
tion as a school director of the village
school at Roslin, L. I. In a style betok
ening earnestness of purpose she set out
to win the election, which, she did only by
a small majority.
Since that time she has made her influ
ence felt In the school "by keeping a vig
ilant eye upon the details of administra
tion. This "extension of home influence"
is having its effectâ not only upon the ef
ficiency of the school, but upon the citi
zenship of th# country thereabouts, and
a promotion of the new civic tpirit every
where.
lv Chicago, too, the movement has
found lodgment. Here large numbers of
rmart young women of. the very best
social position have allied themselves
with Hull House, where they discharge
such duties as are commensurate with
their earnestness, development and time.
Many of these young women, by the way
became workers In the Settlement be
cause the idea of helpfulness appealed to
their emotions. But having once felt the
exquisite thrill of really servingâ of doing
some real good for Eomebodyâ they be
came "workers." devoting a part of each
day or each week to their appointed du
ties.
San Francisco, too, has reached a state
of serviceâ a state where the leisure
women, the maids and matrons of the
smart set are restless unless they have
come definite service to perform; and this
is quite in keeping with the divine laws of
recompense and retribution.
You never saw a happy, maid or mat
ronâone that didn't get periodical at
tacks of "blues"â that gave up all her
days and nights to the Inane demands
of society, euch as teas, where they gos-
Rlp, cards, where they gamble, and din
nere, where they stuff. The soul of the
society girl differs but little from that of
a girl of the plain people, and the need of
Ell eouls Is serviceâ if they would be
happy.
And thus It is that . we find to-day an"
array of smart women In San Fran
cisco doing philanthropic, educational and
cultural work, these interspersed between
their teas, dinners and dances.
And while this- balancing of pleasure
and duty is the only royal road to happi
ness, to have some definite duty r in the
social life about us is to bear the stamp
of smartness.
To be idle to-day is to be dead without
knowing it and out of it socially.

MAKES CHARGE
OF CONSPIRACY
Charging Harry F. Hartzell, Charles
H. Pool and Charles C. Boynton, former
president, cashier and secretary respec
tively of the Golden State Bank, with
conspiracy to defraud the stockholders
of the institution, the bank, through
Douglas S. Watson, now president of the
Institution, filed suit to set aside a con
veyance of property, disposed of through
the operation of the alleged conspiracy,
to James C. Meyers at a price $20,000 be
low Us actual market value.
Joined as defendants with the alleged
conspirators are Wallace A. Hcuts and
A. S. Crowder, former directors of the
Institution, James C. Meyers, the pur
chaser of the property in question, and
Philip E. Bowles, president of the Amer
ican National Bank. Watson alleges that
last July a meeting of the directors, Hart
zell, Pool, Boynton, Houts and Crowder,
was called to discuss the advisability of
disposing of a piece of. property belong
ing to the bank and located at the corner
of California and Polk streets. At that
time, it is said, the directors agreed that
it tvculd be to the best interests of the
Bank to sell the property in question, all
of the directors affixing their signature
to a. resolution to that effect, but this
ended the connection of Houts and Crow
der with the deal.
At a later date, it is allrged. Hartxo.ll,
Pool and Boyntnn gnt together and after
completing their conspiracy to sell the
property below the market value, in fact
well knowing its actual value and making
vn effort to dipnese of it at its true v*alue.
Â»<=t a price of $70,000 upon it, and took
Ifpyrra into their confidence, who. it Is
*Uejred, did not act for himself, but as
an ag?nt for President Bowles of the
American National Bank.
Then, it is alleged, thÂ«>y completed ne
gotiation for the disposal of the prop
erty to Meyers, as agent for Bowles, for
JTO.OfW and convoyed the property to him
for that sura. Watson alleges that when
this <3ra! was carried through by the prin
cipals thpy well knew that they were act
ing in fraud of the rights of the stock
holders of the institution, as the property,
the pialntlft alleges, would readily bring
536,000 in open market.
Watson asserts that he has tendered
to Meyers a return of the $70,000 In con
sideration of thÂ« reconveyance of the
property, but that he refuses to accept
the came. Insisting: upon keeping- the real
ty In question. In conclusion Watson
prays that the defendants be compelled
to reconvey the property to the plaintiff
corporation upon the payment to the pur-

RAISCH'S ATTORNEYS ATTACK :
THE FEDERAL. IXDICTMEXT
Contend Thnl It Is \ol Applicable to
Defendant Even If He Committed
Acta as Charjgrd.
Former Deputy County Clerk Wil
liam C. Raisch, indicted for selling
fraudulent certificates of naturaliza
tion, withdrew his plea of not guilty
yesterday in the United States District
Court and through his attorneys, Bert
Schleslnger and Samuel M. Shortridge,
interposed a demurrer to the Indict
ment on the ground tha.t It does not
charge the accused with the commis
sion of any offense.
The section of the United States Re
vised Statutes under which the indict
ment was drawn makes it an .offense
for an applicant for naturalization or
any person acting- as a witness for
such applicant to sell a certificate of
naturalization or to" do any of the
thiflgs which the United States District
Attorney's office atempts to set forth
were done by Raisch. As Raisoh was
neither an applicant for naturalization
nor a witness for un applicant, it is
contended by his attorneys that the
law cannot be applied to him.

PAXTON LOSES
THE JUDGMENT
Court Orders Him to Pro

His Afflicted Children
GBAHAM DECIDES; CASE
Holds That the" Statutes
Place Legal Obligation
Upon Delinquent Parents
Superior Judge Graham has ordered
Blita W. Paxton, 'th^ Santa Rosa cap
italist to supply funds for the mainten
ance of his afflicted children, Roma and
John W. Paxton. \/,Th"e -plea of JPaxtoh
that tha flight of the years had depleted
his bank account. and lefthlm with but
sufficient income to properly provide for
his-presenf wffe and -' the child that Is
theirs availed him not. ;\u25a0 :
Basing his opinion of the condition of \u25a0
Paxton's rtnances on. ..the fact that for;:
many- years he paid his children | $100 a \u25a0
mOnth and paid it promptly, showing that
he had no,difficulty>in commanding; such
a sum., when It pleased him" to do / so,
Judge Graham directed that he .continue
to make such payments, th<i : same 1 to
date from last June when the -children
filed their action In \u25a0an effort- to -'save
themselves from becoming public charges. -
In his opinion Judge. Graham, says:*,,:-;
. "John W. Paxton and Roma' W. Pax^',
ton ha ve brought separate actions against j
their father and mother to j compel them;;
to> make suitable allowance. v ,"for.;~- their

\u25a0"It is the duty of the father.* the mother,;
and the children of any poor person*, who ;
is unable to maintain himself by "work: to i
maintain such person to the: extent;: of
their ability. The promise of, (an ; adult
child to pay for the necessaries previously,
furnished to such parent is binding.
Pending the hearing of these actions, on :
their merit, John W. and. Roma VV. Pax
ton have made- application to. this, court
for a temporary'allowance for their main
| tenance and support. "'.
QUESTION OP OBLIGATION.
"The question presented to this court
for its consideration is: Does 'Section.SOfi

tion on the part of. the parents to support
their, children who. by reason of. -their
infirmities, are unable" to maintain them

"This proposition is easy of t solution,
and under the statute of this State must

SUNDAY \u0084. OCTOBER 29, 1905'
THE PRESIDENT'S TOUR.
WHEN President Roosevelt finishes his present tour he will
have visited every State and Territory in the Union except
Alaska and Hawaii. It is the first time since the adoption of
the constitution that a President of the United States has visited
every part of the country, met all the people and spoken to them
face'to face^ It is an example that may well be followed by future
Presidents. The country is so vast, with such differences in its phy
sical features and resources, that the man who administers its
nifairs should see it all, meet the people and study their ways; and
wants in the region where they make and maintain .their homes.
This will in the future be considered the duty of the President.
There is no doubt that our legislative affairs would 'go more
smoothly if the same duty were required of members of, Congress.
Senator' Stewart of Nevada once advanced" the proposition that
railroads should be required to transport members of Congress dur
ing the recess, and that they should be required by law to travel
outside their own districts and States to study the country and
better equip themselves for their duties. There is wisdom in the
proposition. Such requirement would bring about a better under
standing between the widely separated parts of the Union and leg
islation would have a better average adaptation to the needs of all.
The President's tour is not for sight seeing merely, nor to cover
long mileage. His usual courage and good sense have made better
use of it. The trip was arranged before the outbreak of yellow
fever in New Orleans, and included that city.
While the epidemic was at its height and courage was at its
lowest ebb in the stricken town, he notified the Mayor that he
would come at the date originally fixed, regardless of fever condi
tions, if it were convenient for the city authorities and quarantine
regulations could be accommodated. At this distance and in our
conditions we cannot estimate the tonic effect of this act of the
President upon the fear and fever smitten people of New Orleans.
It infused them with courage, put hope in the .place of despair,
caused them to defy the fever by not fearing it and to redouble 'the
efforts to extirpate the epidemic. The President's courageous offer
came to them like the message of an ally offering to come to the
relief of a city besieged. It will not be forgotten in the South, where
such a spirit is peculiarly appreciated.
On his tour he has every where # discussed live topics in his
speeches. The policy of his administration has been fearlessly de
fined and his purpose made plain. He is the most open-minded and
frank spoken of men. His opponents need use no searchlight to
find him and know where he stands. He has declared himself on
the railroad rate question, the canal and every other policy of the
Government that is of common interest to the whole In
the incidents of his tour are furnished evidences that it was a mis
take to suppose that he had reached the zenith of his fame when
he made peace between Japan and Russia.
At his meetings in the South the people put among, the gar
lands that graced the platform where he spoke the good Christian
legend, "Blessed is the peacemaker." But it is evident that before
him lie other heights to be scaled. In the midst of our industrial
prosperity and between sections of our country appear contentions
that must be placated. To bring about peace between rival inter
ests and rival sections more genius is required than directed the
peace between two nations suffering from bloody warfare.
Even-body believes that the genius of the President is equal to
the task, and that he will succeed, for he has taken the people into
his confidence. Then what?. No man can tell.. This Southern tour
is full of significance. It is a survey of the politics of the future. In
that future party names will cease their association with the closed
policies of the past and the ancient issues and emergencies of the
last century which brought existing parties into being. â¢ Men will
find themselves in a new political environment. We may have in
peace the same effects that were produced by the Civil War, when
men crossed party lines back and forth, and discovered that the
maintenance of the Union as a supreme necessity had made former
party lines illegible and party names empty and void of meaning.
The entire personal independence of the President, his. respect
for good government and a square deal above all other things, are
preparing the way for wjiat may be the most significant realignment
of American politics that has ever occurred. Our system of gov
ernment has given always a greater rigidity to our party politics
than is known in any other country that is under constitutional gov
ernment. To break that rigidity requires either an all enveloping
issue or a man of supreme strength. President Roosevelt seems to
have the strength, and it is responded to in the South by an evident
disposition of readiness on the part of the people.
CUTLER'S STUDY OF LYNCHING.
JAMES ELBERT CUTLER, sometime -instructor in political
economy in Yale University, and now instructor in economics
in Wellesley College, has made an exhaustive examination of
one of the greatest stains on our civilization in his new book, "Lynch
Law; an Investigation Into the History of Lynching in the United
States." While deploring the barbarism of the practice of lynching
the book is rather a gathering of the completest information upon
â¢which to enable readers to form their own opinions than it is. an
effort to force the author's conclusions upon his readers.
We are told that the origin of the word is from the unau
thorized court of Charles Lynch, of Bedford County, on the upper
waters of the James River in Virginia. Charles Lynch did not in
flict capital punishment, but he decreed torture to Tories from the
standpoint of justice as seen by Whigs. The term Lynch's law be
came current in that region and thence spread westward. The prin
ciple of its development was that "circumstances may arise under
which measures, though not strictly warranted by law, are justi
fiable from the imminence of the danger." The modern meaning
of the term, that is, "death at the hands of a mob without trial," is
attributed to the lawless proceedings which took place in the West
ern and Southwestern portions of the United States in 1850. Dr.
Cutler believes that in its last analysis lynching in this country is
without any justification whatever. He admits, though, that while
we can find no grounds for its justification, the fact remains that it
has repeatedly been justified in one way or another. He* says:
"From the standpoint of the frontiersmen and pioneers, summary
procedure in certain cases was wholly justifiable. From the stand
point of the Southerners during the reconstruction period, summary
procedure was likewise wholly justifiable. To men living in a com
munity where a particularly brutal and barbarous crime is commit
ted upon a white person by a negro, 'the prompt lynching of the
negro, even with some torture and cruelty, seems entirely defen
sible." / - ,
Dr. Cutler holds to the opinion that lynchings do not tend to
deter criminals from the offenses that provoke the summary and
irregular punishments. It is doubtful if that belief would be up
held by the results achieved by the vigilance committees of the
West or the Ku-Klux clan of the South, or by any other exercisers of
the remedy of lynch law who have had large'experience. Its force in
that way is probably dependent upon the measure of its necessity in
the primitive right of defense when the regular- law proves impotent
to be a sufficiently strong deterrent. Perhaps, the main conclusion
arrived at by the author is that "the only ultimate remedy for lynch
ing is a strong public sentiment against it."
This conclusion is probably a studious and wise one; but still
the surest way, and in some sections perhaps the only way/to foster
that sentiment will be to have the regular courts "made to act so
nearly as swift, as certain, and as deterringly, terrible, as does Judge
Lynch in cases of the one most unpardonable form of crime Hvhich
is the most justifiable excuse for citizens taking the. law into their
own hands. In the matter of lynching, the Springfield Republican
holds that our sentiment against it "must include a fuller practical

realization of the enormity of the'erime which in the case of negroes
hasso greatly increased since the civil war, "as well as the certainty
that that crimes will cause lynchings in whatever,' American commu
nity it may occur." Whatever theoretical opinions may be held
about the way to stop lynchings for that one; crime which chiefly
seems to 'excuse them, 'it is probably a correct prediction to say
that practically lynchings will cease .when negroes cease to commit
that crime for which they are lynched.
GREAT JEWISH CELEBRATION.
IT is two hundred and fifty years since the Jews first settled in
America, and they intend to celebrate and commemorate this an
niversary. An executive committee in New iYorkGity is taking
charge of the preparations, for celebration, and they have appointed
a general committee to co-operate.. This- co-operative .committee has
representatives in every State and " Territory, and most of the im
portant cities of the country. A part of the programme is' that
every Jewish congregation in the United States is to hold appro
priate services on Saturday, the 25th of -next November, and on
Sunday, the 26th, every Jewish Sabbath school is to be urged to
hold similar services. ,
The executive committee is sending out a pamphlet; containing
brief notes of information about the history, of the Jews in America.
The anniversary is dated from the grant of privileges, to the Jews
by the Dutch West Jndia Company, in 1655. This grant" was made
to the Portuguese Jews^ to settle .in the New Netherlands, notwith
standing the remonstrance of Governor Stuyvesant against it. After
many consultations the company decided to allow these Jews to \ sail
to and to trade in the New Netherlands, and to remain there. To this
permission one provision, and one only, was attached, namely, that
the poor among them should not become a burden to the community,
but be supported by their own nation. The pamphlet says that the
proudest title of distinction that the Jews of New York have is that
they have sacredly observed and strictly performed; that condition
imposed upon them 250 years ago in the charter of their liberties.
There are now upward, of 1,250,000 Jews in the United States,
and 750,000 of these are in New York. The pamphlet explains the
â¢reason why so many of the new arrivals in this country have not
attained the highest standard of citizenship. It says they bring
with them unfamiliar customs and strange ideas which are the
product of centuries of unexampled persecution. A wordof. hope
and commendation is put forward for the Russian Jew. They are
said to be rapidly becoming the "American Jew, and we shall live
to see the time when the- present dwellers in the tenements will,
through their thrift and innate moral powers, hitherto repressed and
benumbed, step into the very forefront of the great army of Amer
ican citizenship."
One of the purposes of the celebration will be to emphasize the
claim that the Jews have the right to be classed as American pio-.
ne'ers ; that they are to be considered not- as interlopers, not as: ex
ploiters, but as active participants in the upbuilding of the nation.
There is said to be a popular fallacy that the Jew is a late-comer, and
that he was unwilling to uridergo.the hardships'of the pioneer, "and to
blaze out newways for industry and commerce. ;, The confutation of
that will come with the -attention ) which the celebration will call
to ' the history of the Jews of America, showing how they have ac
cepted and -fully justified their citizenship. .

A CONCILIATOR.
A certain Illinois Congressman is of the
stalwart brand of Republican, and" looks
with disfavor ori anything in the nature
of a compromise with'his political 'foes.
During a recent campaign he arrived in
a town where he -was to speak. ;. The
chairman of the Republican Town Com
mittee met him and offered him some
suggestions as to the sort of speech that
the situation there demanded.
"Mr. X.,"/said the chairman earnest
ly, "the I Democrats here are wavering.
They are dissatisfied with their platform|
and with their candidates, and they re
quire only a little persuasion to win them
over. -Be conciliatory; be conciliatory."
That night the Congressman made a
speech that, if lacking in anything, , cer
tainly was , not lacking.' in .vigor, and he
wound up by saying In thunderous tones:
"If the whole Democratic party of this
State were In a basket and suspended

. A REPORTERETTE has not the dig
fclty of being a dictionary word, but if the
fame is new to you it need not puzzle
you for more than a minute before you
Suess that it is a playful cognomen ap
plied to a little she reporter. It is used
'by one of that genus, Rhoda Massey, the
leading character in the new book called
"The Yellow Journalist," written by j
Miriam Michelson. an ex-newspaper
woman, now an excellent novelist, as wit
ness the successful "In the Bishop's Car
riage." and the clever, inimitable "The :
Madigans." The particular reporterette
9 who is' the quite yellow journalist of the
\u25a0 new story is, to carry the word coinage
*â¢ bit further and with analogous inter
pretation, a most audacious devilette.
The definition of this last might be given
in the words of the Irish chambermaid
in one of the private houses into which
the reporterette half burglarized and
â¢wholly lied her way in an unscrupulous
hunt fcr scoops, to wit, *'Ye decaytful
little divvle."
A graphic epitome of the -book may be
found In its one picture, the frontispiece,
Jfhowing a girl surreptitiously crouching
on a high cornice just beneath a half
l>pen window, intent on spying and eaves
dropping. That girl Is the "yellow jour
nalist." Let us glance upon it in a
. French mood arid shrug our shoulders.
Voila tout!
As for the meaning of the adjective
â¢â¢yellow** as applied to journalism, per
haps that should give us pause for half a
paragraph. It may signify different
things to different minds. It may imply
enterprise, brains backed by boldly and
munificently expended money and the ex
ploitation of the news by methods start
ling to slow conservatism; and again it
may mean sensationalism running away
with itself into absurdity, scandal mon
g ering, unscrupulously grasping for
eeoops, and bad taste, which, seeking for
verve, verges too close upon the forbid
den to delicacy and decency. Perhaps
the fairest thing to say is that there are
many shades of yellowâ ail the way from
brass and fever plague to the true gold
of journalistic talent- Dana of the New
l'ork Sun Invented the appellation yel
low journalism and applied it, during
1 the reign of "the yellow kid." to the New
' York World and the Journal, and meant
it for an epithet implying contemptuous
condemnation. It would have been inter
esting if Miriam Michelson, who Is an
cxpeiienced newspaper weman, and an ex.
ceeding clever writer, had given us at
the beginning of her book a concise defin
ition of what she means by "yellow"
"when the entitles her story "The Yellow
Journalist." Even after one has read the
boo* clear through and tried to grasp
the ensemble of the thing it is confusing
to try to guess just what, in her secret
soul, the author thinks of the merits or
decency of the character she has por
trayed under the name of a yellow jour
nalist. Certainly she allows the heroine
of many scoops to be quite proud of her
self in spite of some few qualms of con
science, whicn the girl always conven
iently buries when they threaten to bar
btr way to geuirig a scoop by He, trick,
pretense, or even theft.
The book is absorbingly interesting:
enough to obtain a wide reading; but
if the public read it with the idea they
t).rp behind the scenes an.l
"learning 1 the true inwardness of mod
ern journalism they will be apt to an
grily and emphatically think: "Well,
condemn the little devilette of a re
porterctte and the whole newspaper
'business that teaches her such tricks,
or even indirectly countenances and
profits by such scheming when it is
"done unordered." Considered as a pic
ture of newjspaperdora. it is calculated
to bring the profession of news gather
ing Into contempt. If Miriam Michel
eon tneaji* to oharacterlzr. not cnter
prlsinK journalism generally, but only
one off-color phase of it, then we must
let it so at that; and the book must
mean, vrhether the Intended it so or not,
that she has riveted the Dana defini
tion to the term yellow journalism,
made it a very ugly color and* justified
the public in using it as a condemning
epithet. A somewhat puzzling- thing
about the book Is the query as to the
authors own attitude toward yallow
journalism. To some it will seem"that
between the lines the author is" only
half-heartedly conden.nlng yellow
methods. Rhoda Ma6sey is the re
porlexette who tells the story in the
first person, and she i* created such a
fascinating Â«Jevilctle her most brazen
ly lying yellowness is doffed aside as
mere peccadillo.
In the newspaper office for which
Rhoda Massey worked tfie whole out
fit was tainted with corruption. Pro
prietor, managing editor, news editor.
city editor, principal reporters, were
all admirably fitted to confuse Rhoda" s
ambitious and daring bead as to the
difference between a talent for getting
desirable information and a disreputa
bly unscrupulous hunt for scoops. Sho
seems to get' her idea* of professional)
honor froin'men whost; work she wishes
to first imitate and then excel, and the
standard of these models is not high,.
She is keenly aware that in a worM
of stern business competition it is re
sults that are wanted from a worker,
"and not efforts and methods; but she j
etrafn* the principle until it breaks
into unprincipled grasping 'at results.
Hurriedly put, it would be the thought
of the editor: "Hustle 'out, strenuous
devilette, and get the scoop; I don t
care a condemn how you get it, but
get it!"
ThÂ«n out gor;s Rhoda, ambitious not
to fall down on her detail, and pre
pared, for the pake ol winning fame
and credit of oije big scoop, to brazen
ly burglarize or trick her way into pri
vate homes; to lie so yellowy that soor.
the public would learn to distrust her
every statement; to steal a letter so
unscrupulously that no household
would want to trust her two minutes
ilom- in a hallway or reception-room,
and to develop a general untrustable
ness that would make the name of :i
reporter a synonym for trickster.
A sentence the story puts into the
mouth of Rhoda's managing editor, while
discussing her tricky methods of secup-
Ins news, says: "A newspaper is a busi
ness property, not a school of ethics."
I This is probably true in a way, but not
\u25a0 true Jn the sense of the impression the
; bock would give the reader. If any as
piring reporter in a first-class office un
dertook to achieve extraordinary success
In the way Rhoda captured hers, he v or
she would suddenly awake to a realiza
tion that a newspaper is indeed a school
of ethics. To steal a letter, to succeed
by keyhole espionage, to practice transom
Intrusion, to surrept a photograph, would
be to severely learn that the â¢ office con
sidered such tricks insufferably bad eth
ics, and that j a responsible newspaper
could better afford to do without a scoop
than to get It that way.
Once the reader wisely decides not to
consider the work seriously as a study
of enterprising modern journalism, the
book may be hugged for literary delight
in it as a cleverly written and absorb
ingly interesting story., or, rather, series
of stories, for Miss Michelson is much
of-a Scheherazade in this linking of con
secutively exciting stories of the adven
tures of the Intense reporterette in her
almost madly determined hunt for scoops.
There is the local charm to it of having
been written by a San Francisco girl who
was a fellow toller among us and has
achieved a success that does credit to
the city; and it has the attractiveness of
local flavor in that the scenes are laid in
San Francisco, and the many stories are
all suggestive of being vividly Imaginative
buildings upon the true stories of our
city's romances, crimes and scandals.
There is a house of mystery; an old
black mammy who holds well-kept secrets
and much power; a pencil will; a China
town story of police corruption, and
others. Through all this, Rhoda moves
as the prime -revealer of all the big se
crets. She is a strangely non-moral creat
ure, this reporterette;- almost like some
sort of a second cousin to the non-moral
Nance Olden of "In the Bishop's Car
riage." If Rhoda ever read the Bible at
all she would probably take from It as
her motto: "It Is the glory of God to
conceal a thing; but the honour of kings
Is to search outa matter." And then set
herself to be a queen overtopping all the
kings of scoops, and to make hers the
honor of unveiling all the deeply hidden
secrets.
The enjoyment of news and the intense
desire to hunt for it is well described in
the book, and some extracts will suggest
something of the nature* of the repor
terette:
"And. oh. I love a secret ! v There's only one
thlrg more fascinating than to know what
nobody else knows; and that Is to give it away
In a glorious, self-conscious, jubilating Â»coop."
"A marl, selfish, unthinking thing like me,
as heedless as an animal whose instinct to
hunt down has been aroused."
â¢\u25a0Trust roe? Not a bit of It. I'd bam
boozled my xay to the thing I wanted so often,
and be knew It Â«o well, that be saw only a
move in the old game."
"To him that hatb sball.be given, is mighty
true of news, aad a wise" reporter will re
member It."
"Woe. â¢woe. to the Rhoda Maetey who stops
to think! She'll get all taaglcd up in .other
people's whims and prejudices. She'll be
troubled by pity and hampered by taste and
worried by doubt. The very ground of her
incouclance and assurance will give way bc
r.t-atii her feet. She'll find her conscience â and
her Ktory'll go a-gllmmerlng."

PRETTY LOVE TALE
TOLD BY A HORSE
Likers of the literary work of Paul
Leicester Ford may have thought when
his brother murdered him a few. years
ago that we should enjoy no more
products of his pen. but a very pretty
little story of his has just been pub
lished, and. we may pick up the pleas
ing posthumous thing and imagine. juSt
for -a happy passing fancy's sake, . that
the sslrit of the; author of. "Janice
Meredith" is still writing delightful
Btorles.for us. It is a love story, . en-,
titled "His Version; of It," and thÂ« "he"
referred to in the "title is a horse. A
love story told by, a. horse is something
of a novelty, and we mightshy.or
balk at it but for the fact that we know
It is going to be a good go when we see
Paul Lelceatcr Ford's name upon , the
white rose and white dove decorated
back; of It. It is the -story of the love
affair of a very charming girl who was
v fine horsewoman. , and it; was because!
of her affectionate companionship with
horses that this ; one, : old "Reveille","
happened to know enough: about . the
affair to be able to have J'hls version of
it," and by means pf hishorse-sensfs.to,

THRETE OF THE ILLUSTRATIONS FROM THE LATK PAUL LEICESTER FORD'S JUST PUBLISHED "HIS VERSION OF IT."
IN WHICH THE AUTHOR PUTS THE WORDS OF A PRETTY LITTLE LOVE STORY IN THE MOUTH OF AHORSE
WHO TALKS VERY ENTERTAININGLY. ; . . . j ;.. ;
participated in it as prlncli-als.
We hear much of match-making
mammas, but of a courtship between
two humans, planned, initiated, devel-;
' oped and finally brought to consumma
tion-by the skilled diplomacy of three
match-making saddle horsjs most of
us might say, with the old Scotchman
of the song, "Saw I never nane."
Do not doubt that the tiling could
happen.- It is a drama of . the horse
world so enllghteningly toM to us that
it might well cause those zuthors who
make a specialty of animal stories
wonder at the race a rank outsider was
giving them at excellence in their own,
trade. Read it; you'll find It one of
the most exquisite stories cf equitation
you ever delighted in.
The tale was told in* a stable to
group of horses as they ate their
apples and oats, and it bugan by the
bay mare making the remark anent
their mistress, Felicia, "She's a dar
ling," whereat the off carriage horse 1
dropped part of his apple In order to
chime in, "That's just what she is." Old
Reveille, now with 4 twenty-elght years
of experience, remarked reflectively,
"She's a thoroughbred, but she's not
the beauty her mother was at the same
age." Then he talked on f ragmen tartly,
and hintingly about what: he could tell
of Felicia's family history, if .he just
would, until he got the curiosity of the
mares and fillies in' the stable as ex
cited as if equine love of a bit of, ro
mantic gossip were as â¢ :.teen as the
human feminine. ;
"Do the fa-nlly know all your se
cret. Reveille?" asked the bay mare,
Lassie, ingratiatingly. \u25a0
"They think they do." replied the
veteran. "They don't,-, though," he
added; and then, heaving a sigh, he
continued: "Hut the ronn filly did,
and Mr. Lewis' big gray."
"Lay you a peck 'of oats, to a quart
that the girls get that ; secret out of
him," whispernd â¢ th'i : â¢ major's saddljp
horse, who was a Ke'ntuckian of thor
oughbred stock.. 'And they eventually
did. Listen to Just this one of the re
marks by which the bay mare. Lassie,,
allured the old horse intoj reminiscent
volubility. "How. rarely, is '\u25a0 the story
telling faculty -.united' wHli the philo
sophic mind; tind^those . two qualities
combined with a finished [but \u25a0, graphic:
style!" That politeVcompllrnent brought,
out the story, and old HeAetlle.; the
one-time war charger, told "how ho and â¢
Mr. Lewis' big gray carried: out the
match-makins scheme- with the super
latively clever ' assistance) of .'the "roan
filly." Old- Reveille htill "has a tender
place in nls memory for the roan filly.

added with'a sigh, and paused a mo

Now tue roan filly was the* saddle

inp the meanness of Mr. :Lewl3; to Fe

men and wojnen, as well as horses, love

instantly = and]; thereat; kicked up; ' - her

'So these actorj and Â£ actress saddle
horses ; arranffe their; parts "and ' play
them to, perfection. They show thejr
fearand hate of Lewis, and then sharp
ly contrast .that 1 with 1 their" love \u25a0of
the- major. Then, they, arrangeâ all
seemingly unbeknowing â .^to gallop
exceeding close together when 1 Felicia
and the major are being borne by
them. When the horses want to hurry
up 'the lovemaklng Reveille, : who Is
bearing the major, "suggests to -the
roan filly, who has Feltctf. in the sad
dle: "Miss Gaiety. I think they will
.llke.it if we snuggle!" ,
"Well, just for -this once I will," re
plied the filly shyly.
. The clever pictures with, which the
book Is illustrated are almost half the
tale. It Is like a story told by pictures.
Henry Hutt did the picture part. Ford
tells It In a very- horsey way, and
there's some clever, small by-play ex
pressions, as, the filly says she "doesn't
care a snafile . bit"; and when" Lewis
wants to mount Reveille, the actor
animn.!. getting -ready"; to buck rebel-
Hously, says .to himself: "Whooi>! Ride

and they add much ,to the little
volume's interest. Of course, it Is easy
to get whole books of .quotations, but
It Isn't so much quotations In^ the
stract as quotations applied that do
you good." Here's one from Shelleyâin
teresting always, but doubly so when
we find It writ down in the diary of a
bride:'
.The . fountains mingle with the . river,
, And â¢ the rivers with the ocean; '
; The ' wln<Js of heaven mix forever
\u25a0 With a sweet emotion ;
Nothing In the world Is single;
\u25a0;\u25a0 All- things by law ,< divine \u25a0;..,;.

And the sunlight clasps the earth.
And' the moonbeams kiss the sea;
"What are all these klÂ«s!ngs worth,
" If.thou kiss not me?
The diary begins about the first of Sep
tember, just at the time the girl begins
to be. a .bride; and. after, we have dipped
deeply enough into the narrative to ; see
that the honeymoon Is going smooth and
sweet- and .thenest-buildlng accomplished
artistically, , we' naturally get to | calculat
ing moons on, our fingers and become
restless to ' jump away forward In the
diary ; to along about some' date of late
spring or . early summer,, and see . if any
thing remarkably happy happens about
that time." * * * And 3ure enough- It "did.
I skipped away over to about the middle
of "May, and,; gee! Look . what \ I found:
"I have wandered, far; from -my, bed of
violets by the lake, .but while I never
really heard the fairies talk In those
sweet . days , * I think I felt their , Influ
ence, .and I feel ltY yet. Indeed, has
staid with mo through; all these years,
and has helped \ me "more through times
of trial and discouragement than all the
things I ever learned in school. **The sun
beams, Hbe scented'ahv the pure .fancies
of a child's heart are .closely akin to 'an
gels,'j'fairies','and -.all- spiritual truth.
And fqr. this "little one, whom we expect
to come and \u25a0dwell;^ with us,\l pray the
same. gentle. companionship of violets and
'fairy^ elves,' with the ...woods,'- sky and
water to: teach" that, which can never be
learned from^ books or, school."
:.j And ' now, just one more quotation from
this diary Jof what seems , such a 'sweet:
young bride. It. will add .to the charm of
it; to; tell the ; reader that it was a girl'
baby : â¢ ; "I - lay : my . finger I on\' the; vet
palm, the wee , fingers \ close over \u25a0 mine,

Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON. Oct. 28.â Perhaps military
organizations in the \ United States may
be interested In a new variety of military
band which is now a regular adjunct of
the First East Surrey Regiment of the
British army and which other martial
bodies in this country are planning to
copy.
This band, which was formed only re
cently, is composed entirely of perform
ers of the mouth-organ. All these musi
cians are members of the First East
Surrey Regiment, and their function
consists of relieving the regular regi-
mental band while on the march. The
effect of their playing seems to be a
good deal more stimulating than that
produced by a drum corps, and the new
idea appears. likely to be. extensively
copied throughout the British army.-.

SEATTLE, Oct. 28.â A gang of burg

unsuccessful in loca^.ng the thieves,

MAKES A PLEA
FOR NAVY YARD
Engineer Eousseau Pointy
Out^That Moire Moneys Is
Required for Mare Island
NEEDED [IMPROVEMENTS
Unless Larger Appropriation
That Has
Been Done May Be Lost
CALL BUREAU, POST BUILDING.
WASHINGTON, OcJ. 28.â Civil Engineer
H. H." Rousseau, U. S. N., at the Mare
Island \u25a0; navy yard, in his annual report
to the â¢Secretary of the. Navy, for itrie
current year, makes a strong plea for
the' development oi the .Aiare island
yard as the Paciric Coast naval | base.
He ;says in part:
":., "While the attitude of Congressidur
ingHhe last two sessions has been, on
thevdepartraent's recommendation, \u25a0 fa
vorable for the retention of the present
site*- of the navy yard for naval pur
poses, mainly perhaps, on the ground
that; it would not be good business pol
icy to abandon, the many millions of
dollars represented in the Mare Island
navy yard without at least making an
attempt to^preserve their value," there
has ..been felt a disinclination of >Con- ;
gress to continue the development of
the navy yard until the condition* of
the.' channel improve.. The cutting
down ! of : the appropriations has .been
very greatly felt and lessened, very
appreciably, what the efficiency and
capacity of the yard. would have been;
had the appropriations been continued
more liberally. During the past year
several' new factors have, made _ their,
importance felt and are constantly;
growing more in weight. If they .are
given the weight by those who deter-:
mine what appropriation shall be made
next year for this navy yard that those
who areVon the' grounds without - excep
tion, believe they : should receive,, the
appropriations necessary to. -carry out
the Improvements will, it is believed, be
more liberally granted as . being more
needed and 'more important than those
of any other naval base that our coun
try possesses. .: ' ' "
'.- "As stated hereinbefore, the most im
portant item is the continuing of chan
nel; Improvements in the Mare Island
Strait. The work has been limited up
to the present time to the shoal strip,
about one mile in length, extending
from the United States receiving ship
Independence to the -torpedo-boat
wharf. \u25a0 â¢ .\u25a0. \u25a0 :
VWlth funds now available it is also
proposed to give attention to increas
ing the depth of the channel at the en
trance of the strait and also opposite
the navy yard proper, where' > necessary.
The work: up to 7 the present . time has
been; aimed to remove the mud already
deposited. The appropriation requested
for next year is to start in on the
work of reducing the quantity of silt
that now enters the Mare Island: Strait
from San Pablo Bay on each flood tide.
,' Since the work of channel improve
ment was commenced two : years . ago
only a little* more than $300,000 has
been' appropriated for this important
purpose. "With the permanent yard Im
provements at stake, which have, cost
considerably over $10,000,000, it : is cer
tainly worth spending up to at least
$1,000,000 to : prevent the , loss that
would ..result from "abandoning .these
improvements ; and the â¢ fullj amount
asked for this purpose this year should
be granted." ' '.''; .'; ,

LONDON,/; Oct. 28.â 1n a severely
plain Georgian- mansion Henry- "W.
Phipps, Pittsburgh's multi-millionaire
and former; partner .of Andrew Car
negie,, is now. settling: down for a term
of residence in town.; If he were in the
United States it , is doubtf ullwbether he
\u25a0v^ould give a second- glance to'such an
ordinary looking buildingâ especially. If
it needed paint as badly as does this
oneâ but seeing that Mayfair is small
and Americans â¢; desiring houses . therein
are numerous, Phipps - cannot afford to
be too particular.
The new ; headquarters of . the Fhlppa
belongs to the. Earl of Crewe and is in
the . most .desirable' part of Curzon
streetâ a thoroughfare , often called
London's Fifth avenue. Unlike his
American neighbors . of distinction,
however, Phlpps Is sheltered from ob
servation of the curious by a twelve
foot '.brick wall ; and the tourist from
Pi ttsbur g who , wants to see how his
fellow townsman lives -will , have to
face a lodge-keeper of discretion.
As Lord Crewe has owned the plaoe
only three, years, 'it. Is "better known as
the home of the Stuart-Wortley family.

NEW YORKER
ROBBED OF
LARGE SUM
James Dunn Loses
$5000 in Coin
and Jewels.
Womanlnvolved Forced
to Disgorge Part of
the Loot.
Police Hush Matter in Order
\u25a0 to Shield Name of the
Notorious Essex.
The local police have been investi
gating' for three days the disappear
ance of $5000 in money and jewelry,
the property cf James Dunn, a capital
ist of New York, who claims he was
robbed of his diamonds and part of his
money in the notorious Hotel Essex, on
Mason street. Thursday night. The po
lice have discovered that a woman
known in the tenderloin district as
Grace Brooks lured Dunn to her room
in the Essex, where she plied him with
\u25a0wine until he was stupid and then
turned him out in the street, minus his
Jewelry.
Later it became known to the police
that several thousand dollars in certi
fied checks and currency that Dunn
had on his person were also missing.
,I>etectives Bunner and Freel finally
traced the Brooks woman to a house
on O'Farrell street, to which she had
fled with a male companion. She was
VÂ»ken fnto custody and subjected to
the "sweating" process for forty-eight
bours, when she grave the officers a
cl<--w to the whereabouts of Dunn's
jewelry, part of which has since been
recovered.
Dunn was formerly the owner of a
hotel in New York. He is well known
In that city and locally. He has been
staying at the St. Francis Hotel.
Friends of Dunn found him wander
ing along Mason street at an early
hour' Friday morning in a dazed condi
tion. It was some time before 'he
could talk coherently, his actions de
noting that he had been drugged.
When he partly recovered conscious
ness he said that he had been lured to
a room in the Essex by GracÂ« Brooks
and a companion named Eastland.
..When Dunn left the St. Francis
Hotel Thursday night he had in
â¢ wallet two certified checks for
SJQOO each and S2OOO in bills. He wore
}ew*lry valued roughly at $850, con
efstlngr of diamond studs, diamond cuff
buttons and a diamond pin In the shape
of a horse. All the Jewelry was gone
end he had only a few dollars in his
jackets when his friends found him.
'.The police have kept the matter
etrictly quiet, evidently to protect the
resort. It was for this same reason
that the Brooks woman was permitted
to gro free, though she was practically
caught with the goods. Dunn's friends
have persuaded him not to prosecute
her because of the notoriety it would
bring.
Dunn says that he has a hazy Idea
thÂ»t he gave some money to saloon
keepers to take care of for him. The
police are endeavoring to locate the
places where he left it.
Dunn is at present in a Hammam
Baths trying to separate himself from
a violent headache. At the St. Francis
Hotel all knowledge of the robbery is
denied. All that is known there is that
Dunn had some jewelry and now he
has it not. v

AKRON. 0., Oct. 28,â Quo warranto pro
ceedings were commenced in the Circuit
Court here this afternoon by Prosecuting
Attorney Hagelbarger, on ' the advice of
ex-Attorney General Monette, of Ohio,
against the Mutual Life Insurance Com
pany and the New York life Insurance
Company, to oust them from the' State by
taking their franchises from them, on the
ground that the' companies have misused
their powers for the past five years in
violation of the laws of the State. Thir
ty-three interrogatories are submitted to
the companies to be answered.
The petitions filed ask that the fran
chise held by the Mutual Life Insurance
Company and the New York Life Insur
ance Company be taken frdm them and
that they be prevented from doing busi
ness in this State. The petitions also
ask that receivers be appointed by the
Circuit Court to take charge of all of
the funds collected, premiums paid by
policy holders of the two companies in
the State and that the receivers collect
all premiums due and hold the funds in
trust.
It is alleged in both petitions that the
companies have during the past five years
misused their franchises, now hold con
tracts that are in direct violation of the
insurance laws of this State, and that
both companies in their annual state
ments to the Insurance Commissioners
failed to disclose a large and substantial

sipated and squandered for illegal, crim
inal and fraudulent purposes. It is fur
ther alleged that the statements filed by
both companies were fraudulent and in
direct violation of the provisions of the
charters held by the companies in this
State.
The receivers to be appointed are au
thorized by the petition to make all cor
rections of premiums and funds due to
the companies in this State, to hold the
fame to be paid out as death benefits un
til tbe final hearing of the cases.
Copies of the petitions were served
on Captain H. O. Feederlee and D. King

ST. PETERSBURG, Oct. 28. â That the Czar* heart has been hardened

"The situation is grave, but not desperate. The rumors that the Czar
has fled, that a state of seige has been declared, that a constitution and uni

dictator and that Minister Pobledotiostseff has resigned are all untrue. Our;
trouble is due to lack of governmental, unity. Each Minister reports to the
Crar separately, thus frequently getting a ukase which conflicts -with some
other department. Thus the Minister of Public Instruction,- General Glazoff,\
obtained autonomy for the universities without informing me;. ''hence meas
ures were not taken to, prevent the universities . becoming "disseminators of
anarchy. ;
"It was proposed to form a responsible Cabinet before the Douma was
authorized. But Count. Solsky, hoping that the announcement of : the Douma
would quiet tue_country, caused ;the order to be; revoked.' thus leaving the
Government headless. The organized revolutionists obey' one head, having
a distinct advantage over, the Government In this respect.

What You Can Do
In a Piano Way
This Week
! We cannot think of a time when more or better piano
and piano-player bargains have been on our floors than are
; at the present time. Upwards of a dozen different makes of
pianos that are easily worth half again as much as we are
1 asking for them. Some of them are almost new. They
are pianos we have taken in exchange for more expensive
instruments. Some of them are pianos that have been
rented, but all are good pianos, and will do good service
for years to come.
i * Equally* good opportunities are offered those who may
.wish a piano-player. We have several Angelus piano-
! players that have been used, or they are styles discon- -
I tinued from regular manufacture, but they, are In perfect

Steinway Piano Dealers
for thirty-five years at Kearny and Sutter streets, San Francisco, /
Several years after its'opening in IS3I by
Ben Rayner, a popular impersonator of
Yorkshire characters, the Strand was
taken by an actress named Waylett, who,
owing to a technical -dispute, failed to
obtain a theater license. Accordingly,
during her regime, patrons of the Strand
paid a dollar at an adjoining confection
er's for a box of lozenges and were "pre
sented" with a box ticket, while half an
ounce of peppermint drops carried with it
admiFcion to the pit.
In recent years the Strand has been the
scene of some lengthy runsâ lengthiest
of all that of "A Chinese Honeymqon,"
which was played for over 1000 nights and
established a record. Toward the end of
its career.' a sign was put up in front of
the playhouse which read: "Established
MCIXII." "The Brixton Bursary" and
"Our Flat" were two big Strand suc
cesses*, another being Broadhurst's famous
American farce "What Happened to
Jones."
>EW FARCE WELL RECEIVED.
R. C. Carton's chariot wheels ran off
the track of success for a while, but
they got back on again with "Mr. Hop-
THE SAN FRANGISeo;:GALL; SUNDAYfOGTOBER 29, ;1905:
kinson," and continue to run smoothly
with "Public Opinion," .an . out-and-out
farce, played for the first time on any
stage at Wyndham's Theater this week.
According to this play, a music hall fa
vorite is bringing the usual breach of
promise suit against an amiable and Impe^
cunlous viscount. The secret arrangement
between the precious pair is that they
shall get married if "Pansy" wins the
suit, and that the Viscount's, contribution
to the exchequer shall be whatever
"Pansy" can extract from his family by
meant, of the suit, while "Pansy's" con
tribution shall be whatever she can ex
tract from four distinguished admirers,'
who in earlier days have witten compro
mising letters to her. ,
The farce Is chiefly concerned with the
latter phase of the scheme nnd with the
wild efforts ofHhe four ex-admirers (one
of whom is the very judge who is trying
the breach of promise suit) to get hold
of the letters. They come together in
"Pansy's" flat, Into which each has
broken in the hope of stealing the let
ters he has, written; and then they all
come together in the home of an Innocent
but irascible man whom they suspect of
having obtained possession of the letters.
It .would. bfi rather elementary fun i f
ttLwere ,ipr c . the." Wit* 6" r i the dialogue
and* the "continued Ingenuity "of the' busi
ness. For the most part there is", sur
prisingly little vulgarity. ;in Carton's
treatment of a subject that easily, might
have produced humor of ther cheap 'and.
nasty sort. But every important charac-,
ter in the play is either a hypocrite or
else disreputable or unpleasant for some
other reason.. The sama was true of "Mr.
Hopkinson." The author's" wife, Miss
Compton, has her usual part of a slangy,
good-natured, easy-going lady -of. fash
ion. Nearly every member of \u25a0 the com
pany is of stellar rank, and the success
of the play was never for a moment in
doubt. . , .â ;
REVIVAL OF SHAKESPEAKE.
Every one thought it- queer. that Arthur
Bourchier should transfer to another
company his amazingly successful ven
ture, "The Walls of Jericho," while pub T
lie interest in Sutro's play was apparently
about as strong as e_ver;in.order to put
on at his own theater, the Garrick, a pro
duction of "The Merchant\6f ' Venice."
But it seems that Shakespeare can com
pete even with j Sutro, for, the Bourchier
"Shylock" is an undoubted, popular and
artistic" success, and. so \u25a0is*{\'ollet Van
brugh's "Portia." Excellent "taste in de
tails and emphasis on vthe:blithe;gayety
of the Venetian young .folk were distin
guishing features of the' prdductlon.
Supernumeraries rarely^' have been so
carefully drilLed as 1 those* crowds of
merry-makers who .danced, befdre Shy
lock's house>.or as the sailors and market
girls who thronged the - -streets of . air.
Bourchler's Venice. .Shylock himself was
neither a demon nor an embodiment of
-pathos, but a vigorous incarnation of pas
sionate and poetic ; race-hatred.
There was an ; unusual 'amount of in
cidental music..and many another evidence
of the actor-nianager's. intention to make
the play enjoyable for .its own sake and
not because it happened.' to be written by
a dramatist whose name happened to be
Shakespeare. The unbounded delight with
which the performance' Is being received
gives food for 'managerial thought.
Ethel Newcomb returned from America
recently to appear with the Queen's Hall

fraudulently conspired with F. R. Nich

quite a sensation and: it is 'intimated

the failure of the Enterprise Bank.*
It was reported late this afternoon
that a shortage of $300,000 in cash had
been .discovered in the accounts' of
Cashier Clarke by Special Government
Examiner Moxey and Receiver Cun
ningham. This money is supposed to
have been loaned out without security
or any record being made of the trans
actions. It was further discovered,' it
is said, that loans were made without
proper security, to .other prominent
persons in this section and that the evi
dence uncoveredby the examiners is so
complete that it is almost sufficient
grounds for the prosecution of the per
sons involved. â¢
Special Examiner Moxey, who is in
vestigating the affairs- of the Insolvent
Enterprise National Bank, is positive
that T. Lee Clarke, the suicide cashier,
was guilty of criminal action in con
nection with the bank's affairs and.de
clared himself to that effect, to-day.
Referring to the alleged confession to
day, one -of Clarke's relatives, who.
would not permit hM'Sale* being meh-!

Letters and messages - r from Receiver
Cunningham, however, justify the
Comptroller in making the statement
that the failure will be'a very bad one
and will justify an assessment of 100
per cent on the stockholders against
their liability. This assessment was
made to-day.
The Comptroller's office also has been
advised that Receiver Cunningham has
to-day brought suit against W.H. An

SAYS ANCESTRY
DOES NOT COUNT
CHICAGO. Oct. 2S.râ Self-styled
American aristocracy received a severe
rap at the hands of Dr. Em 1 1 G. Hirsch.
Dr. Hirsch preached at Israel Temple
"on * the relative significance of origins
and outcomes In society and religion.
"If you are to have a noble family,"
he said, "you must 'get back to the be
ginning and if you have the proper
number of ancestors you are noble.
"These ancestors, however, snpuld
not, be looked up too carefully, or sonus
one who,'' in common parlance, was a
cutthroat and- a thief may be found.
All the ancestors who came to Europe
were of that class. Probably, the an
cestor who is to be the object of a
family's worship was a man with a big
stick, who increased his territory by
killing off his neighbors and annexing
their possessions. In that way all the
States of Eiurope grew.
"' "If tit is the beginning that counts,
where would Lincoln be? He .had no
pedigree; not in his immediate parents,
at least, though I believe hid mother
must have 1 had some sort of nobility
in her. . ; >/-;>"
"The greatest . men in America have

came over, not "in the Mayflower, but in

Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, Oct. 28. â Bearing half a
dozen books under his arm, a shabbily
clad lad trudged along light-heartedly
a country road from Bristol fifty-seven
years ago. The lad was then only 15
years old and he had 'tramped several
miles to the city to buy the books, but
the joy he felt In their possession made
the return journey an easy one. When
a mere lad he had had to set to work
to help support hia family and .hi 3
schooling had been of the scantiest
character, but it had imbued in him
an insatiable thirst, for knowledge
which he was determined to satisfy at
any cost of self-denial. Those six
volumes represented the beginning of
a library by. George Ho well, the vet
eran labor leader.. which now amounts
.to more than 7QOO volumes and weighs
something like eight tons. As a pri
vate collection it is probably unique in
the. variety and scope of the works it
contains on labor and economic ques
tions. A committee has been formed
with the object of purchasing the
library and - handing it over to some
institution devoted to the working
classes "as a monument to a sturdy,

In accordance with instructions given by .
the President, Secretary Root will initiate
negotiations with Sir Mortimer Durand,
British Embassador. for the purpose of
limiting the use of the waters of Niagara
River for industrial purposes. The pros- *
pect of the drain of Niazara Falls a.a one
of nature's scenic wonders teas called to .
the attention of the President some
weeks ago by a civic association of New
York.
In connection with the negotiations, it
will be necessary for the two Govern

holder and more insistent in the demands
made in their speeches. It is "true there
haa been no , disorder in St. . Petersburg
and that General Trepoff, the Emperor'b
strong man, has taken every, 1 measure to
put down the . uprising in its incipiency,
but he has not felt ; sure enough of his
position to act boldly with regard to the
revolutionary meetings at the .university
and has contented himself with issuing
warnings which, not having been en
forced, are taken by the agitators as evi
dence of lack of backbone.
As before Friday's giant meeting,
at the university, it was again an
nounced to-day \u25a0 that further meet
ings there would not be permitted,
,but the college portals were again open
to-night ; and the hospitality of the uni
versity was extended . to a." group of law
yers and other professional men, one of
whose-; orators, referring to . the old Rus
sian folk. legend that the world is sup
ported on the backs of three whales, said
that. the autocracy, rested on three foun
dationsâ money,' the army and the loyalty
of. tho people-^but that Russia, was .now
bankrupt, that the moral sympathy. of the
people was alienated' and that the army
alone remained true, -and this, he pre
dicted, would not be lons. '
Another speaker _qpenly .preached ..ter
rorism and advocated "making an exam
pie" of a number of high personages.
Count de Witte's ally in the stupendous
task he is about to undertake will be
General Trepoff. who. though all his life
has been spent as an instrument for re
pression and though he twice has \u25a0 es
caped attempts by t..~ . terrorists' instru
ments of death, has come to realize that
the old order of things is changing and
giving place to a new, and is now a gen
uine convert to the policy of giving the
people a share In the Government.
The best opinion is that nothing will
save the 'present Government from com
plete ruin. Many shrewd observers be
lieve de Witte comes too late.
The condition in St. Petersburg Is that
of one fairly .under siege and one with
surprises threatened from within, almost
completely isolated and Its scanty store
of provisions being rapidly exhausted.
The garrison, however, is overwhelming
ly large. General Trepoff haa 90,000 troops
under his command, which are distributed
in every section of the .city. There' Is
scarcely a block without its military
patrol. Infantry and . cavalry are | quar
tered In courtyards throughout the- city,

"The entire work of the association has
been carried on." said Mr. Benjanrin, "at
an expense of less than $65,000 during a
period of thirteen years. The greater
portion of the amount subscribed was ex
pended during the first two years of the
association's existence. We are going to

Mr. Benjamin also salfi:
FOURTEENTH CO?. VEXTIOW.
Th-i California Miners' Association Is aboul
to hold its fourteenth annual convention in
Nevada City. It has becomf- one 6f the prom
inent useful organizations In the State. Its
membership comprises not only the greater
portion of the business ana mercantile houses
In San Francisco that are directly lnterestml
In a-commerclal way, hi tl(e success of the
mining industry, but the membership list con
tain? the names of a great majority of thÂ«
prominent mining operators and a' number of
the great mining companies... It is.-an organ
ization that occupies an if ifluchtlal position.
The administration of Its affairs has been car
rltd on from year to year by \u25a0 men \u25a0 who have
devoted their time, their energies and â¢ thÂ»lr
talent for the advancement and the betterment
of the industry without any remuneration
whatever.
Its functions have been. largely legislative.
The organization came -at a time ' when the
great hydraulic mining. Industry of.: the . State
was paralyzed. The operation of the hydraulic
mines had been enjoined by. the United States
courts, and more than one niindred \u25a0 millions of
dollars' that had been" invested In j hydraulic
mining plants was absolutely tied up and ren
dered useless through Injunction that amounted
ta : practically; a confiscation, of the. nilnera'
property by the CSoverimifnu Xaturally - the
miners joined together In ap effort 10 reliovs
themselves from thiÂ« condition, -and* the' result
was the organization of the California Miners'
Association. -The officers and -5 members .went
to work to formulate eotne^plan whereby' their
crippled Industry '.--cw ld agmn became .one of
the great factors In the ai7a;rs of the State.
/Various . plans -were. ' suggested, but nothing
ot a definite nature was accuinpUehftd until the
association, succeeded in having the so-called
Â»."amin<riti bill passed in Congress. This bill
provided for the resumption of hydraulic min
ing, to be carried on under; the supervision. of.
a corpsof. Government engineers to be known
as the Callloinla Lw-bris coainilssion, and pro
vided for the construction of dams by the mine
owners, according to plans furnished ; by the
Debris Commission and permitted them to work
their mines under license from the Debris Com
mleslon provided that theyt compiled' with the
requirements -of the law. In thU way four
hundred- licenses have beÂ«n granted permitting
mlneH to work which otherwise would have re
mained idle. The act lteelf was a compromise
measure and has never been , satisfactory to
the miners.' But it was the best' that could
be done under the. circumstances and the only
relief measure that it seemed possible to get. ,
-LARGE -SUMS RAISED.
The Government engineers recommended that
restraining barriers be constructed : on :.i the
Tuba River to hold back the enormous amount
of material that waÂ» deposited in the < canyon*
and tributaries of the Yuba, , not only debris
irom the mines, but all debris that is carried
down by the torrential' streams. They esti
mated that $suo,ou> would be necessary to
tarry out this work. The officers and com
mltteemen of the association secured thii ap
propriation, one-half from the Federai Govern
ment uu<i one- ualt iroiu tne riuuu
Alter this appropriation had . been secured, a
report came irom , the engineers showing mat
the work would cost f XGo.OOO instead Of $500,000,
and it was thereiore. ne.cessary .that an addi
tional appropriation of $3UU,OOCM be secured.
Again the members of the asrociation took up
the task of securing this - additional, money,'
and were successtul in their eitorts, one-half
being appropriated by the Federal Government
and one-halt by the btate fcuKriniunu. Â±..e
construction work '.on these dams , has | been
prosecuted vigorously. ,and, effectively â and
while in a measure experimental, the conser
vative members Of the association teel that
thlo work will be the natural solution of the
problem 'of the redumption on hydraullo mining.
It may be that other conditions. : will have to
be asHociatea with the \u25a0 construction 1 of . these
great barriers, but It has been conceded that
the barriers will be. the foundation for the
work of the future.
,"These two enterprises have , been the : main
work of the association, but, aside' from this,
the association's influence has be.en great both
In Congress and in the Legislature of this
State. It has secured the passage of < many
amendments to mining laws and the enacting
of new laws benefiting" the mining Industry,

SHUTDOWN THREATKXRt).
The miners In Northern; California
counties are troubled by Urn scarcity
of water beca yse the rains have" not

this week, according tb the Miner-
Transcript, all the mines of Nevada
City and ' Grass- Valley will be cora

4o'.'shut off a large part 1 dt the 'water
Â»6utfply,. so-' ; that there will be barely
more than enough to run the pumps in
the mines. : - . - \u25a0
This means that all_ other parts of
the mines will be; compelled to sus

of "copious rains. The ' same general
conditions exist at Truckee.
: The Truckee Republican reports' that
this ",1a the dryest season to d;ite that
Nevada County has had in twenty
\u25a0years. Not even a shower to lay the
dust has, fallen at. Truckee since Jlay.
Water is -scarce at Graniteville and
soon there will be none to use for
power. The mines in the hills above
Nevada- City, were cut off from water
last .Tuesday. If the conditions do not
change, according to the Truckee Re
publican, hundreds of miners In Nevada
,County v will be in idleness for a time.

Foreign markets showed growing anxie

market on this account. The deposit of
5500 000 at the sub-treasury for transfer

SEYMOUR ANSWERS M
JOHNSON'S CHARGES
Declares Defense Failed to
Show Emmons Jurors Mis
conducted Themselves.
SACRAMENTO. Oct. 28.â District At
torney A. M. Seymour occupied the time
this forcnocn in Judge Hart's department
of the Superior Court in arguing against
the motion made by Grove L. Johnson
for a new trial for E. J. Emmons, the
former State Senator from Kern County,
who was found guilty of bribery and who
is now awaiting sentence.
One of the arguments of Johnson was
that the defendant should have a new
trial because of misconduct on the part
of some of the jurors, the contention be

die that way would never do for me,"
was all that A. M. ; Brush, aged 91
years, had to say concerning his be
ing knocked down by the Salt Lake

was walking along; tha railroad track,
on his way to a ranch near Urbita
Springs, to get some milk, when^ he
heard the newspaper train coming. "He
stepped outside the rails and continued
on his walk. He did not get far enough
from the rail and the end of the pilot
beam caught him on* the shoulder,
sending him flying down the right of
way. .
The springs are only three-quarters
of a mile out and the train rushed on,
the conductor hurrying up town to get
a doctor. When the physician arrived
at the springs he met Brush trudging
along with his can of milk. He at
first refused to submit to an examina
tion, but finally submitted and it was
found, that the skin on his shoulder
was bruised. /

Delegates to Convention

ly *xpressii:tj its approval of Presi
dent Roosevelt's cJlorts in the inter
est of peace during: the recent confer
ence of Itussii-.n and Japanese peace
envois at Portsmouth. N. H.
The most interesting question dis
cussÂ«d by the convention to-day, par
ticularly to Los Angeks, was the Goth
enburg system of controlling the liquor
trafir. The temperance organization
declared a^ain&t the scheme, which it
iias been proposed to adopt in this
city. In no uncertain manner. Mrs.
Margaret Dye Lllis presented a motion
to prhit J 0.000 copies of that portion
of the President's annual address
toucbirif the impracticability of the
Goth'M.bcxs sysierr. She was stronsr
ly supported In a speech by Dr. E. .-3
i;hapir:an, head of the temperance
forces of Caliiorniu. who recently con-
Oucted the' unsuccessful campaign to
close saloons in Los Angeles. Upon Dr.
Chapman s amendment it was decided
to print 20,000 copies of Mrs. Stevens'
remarks on the Gothenburg system
and circulate them In Los Angeles.
There was a.:i outburst ,of enthusiasm
among the dc-lcg.ites when Miss Kear
ney proposed the resolution commenti
ing: President I;oosevelt's efforts in the
Interests of iÂ»eace. Mrs. Ellen M.
Thatcher wanted to petition the Pres
ident to turn over the house where the
iÃace conference was held to the boys
of the navy. Another delegate desired
to Â«'on,jratulate him on his manliness.
""ConiiiiS' Croui a woman from the
Southland.' ssid President Stevens, re
ltrrins- to Miss Kearney's" motion, "the
compliment is very significant, espe
cially, at a time when President Roose
velt ha? Just left the South."
Miss Kearney's motion was adopted
with KTÂ«-at applause. The convention
also decided to write the President,
embodying- a recommendation from thu
oflicial board that he give eonstdera
tion in his annual message to Congress
to th* .ipne^l of the VT. C. T. U. for the
suppression of the liquor traffic, which
It believe'! to be the most prolific cause
of race suicide.

will succeed herself as president" of
the National W. C. T. U. The election
ie set for next Tuesday, but It Is not
expected to furnish any part of the
programme excitement, as it is gener
ally understood that Mrs. Stevens, Miss

PAYS TRIBUTE
TO DEAD FRIEND
Grover Cleveland Delivers
Touching Eulogy at Un
veiling of Morton Statue
NEBRASKA CITY, Neb.. Oct. 28.â 1n
the presence of 5000 persons, and with
elaborate ceremonies, a statue of J. Ster
ling Morton, Secretary, of Agriculture in
the late Cleveland Cabinet, and founder
of Arbor day, was unveiled at Morton
Park this afternoon. Sterling Morton, a
grandson of tbe secretary, drew aside the
curtain which exposed the statue to view.
There were six addresses, principal of
which was that of Grover Cleveland,
which was a touching eulogy of his for
mer Cabinet officer and personal friead.
Other addresses were by Governor
Mickey, who welcomed the visitors; Hon.
Hilary A. Herbert. David R. Francis,
Adlai E. Stevenson and Dr. George L.
Miller, the latter of Omaha.
Cleveland's address was an eloquent
tribute to the personal Qualities and
broad statesmanship of J. Sterling Mor
ton. He testified to Morton's "lofty civic
righteousness, his simple and sure stand
ards of public morality, his stern insist
ence on official honesty and his sturdy
adherence to opinions deliberately and
conscientiously adopted."
Morton, said the speaker, believed that
waste in public expenditure was a sih,
and in his official capacity, "the noxious
atmosphere of governmental extrava
gance could not blind his eyes, nor could
the ridicule of those who had learned to
scoff at official economy, or the threats
of those who perfidiously contrived to
appropriate nubile funds to private gain,
drive him to compromise with wrong."
Continuing, Cleveland said:
"We have fallen upon days when our
people are more than ever turning away,
from their old faith in the saving grace
of character, and flocking to the worship
of money-making idols. Daily and hourly,
ln the light of investigation and ex
posure, characterless lives are seen in
appalling numbers, without chart or com
pass, crowded upon the rocks and shoals
of faithlessness and breach of trust. How
ill have these wrecked lives exchanged
the safe course and the harbor of ,honor
and usefulness which character and rec
titude point out. for a wild and headlong
rush over unknown seas ln a consuming
search for peif.
"If our people ever return again to their
trust In character as a steadying force in
our restless enterprise and Immense ma
terial growth, It will be when they take
to heart the full significance of such a
commemoration as this. We memorialize
a man who not only earned the lasting
honor of his countrymen, but whose life
ln all things worthy of high endeavor
was abundantly successful."

NEW HAVEN, Conn.. Oot. 28.â The
license for the production of Bernard
Shaw's play, "Mrs. Warren's Profes
sion," at the Hyperion Theater, was re
voked to-day by order of Mayor John
P. Stirley. The pieoe was given a
performance here last night .and was
to have been presented again this aft

The Mayor did , not attend last
night's performance, but said he had
received from persons in whose Judg
ment he placed entire confidence com
plaints that the play was unfit for
presentation, on the ground of Inde
cency.
A large crowd besieged the theater
doors at the hour set for the matinee
and read the announcement that ! the

MARC BLUMENBERG
ON PIANOS
Accepted Authority on Pianos Handle*
Subject Editorially In ".Musical
Courier Extra."
I have seen pianos and tested pianos
with dealers' names on them that were
far better than many pianos, and even
than most pianos, with the piano man
ufacturers' names upon them. I am pre
pared substantially to verify this with
facts.
Having had such an experience I am
actually forced to assume that position,
and, furthermore, as none of the trade
editors are competent to give expert
opinion on pianos, I, as the editor of
THE MUSICAL COURIER and an ac
cepted authority, recognized as such in
written acknowledgment from most
piano manufacturers of Europe and
America, â¢ * â¢ am the only Journal
istic force that is enabled to decide
upon a piano on actual, expert knowl
edge.
Among pianos I recently examined is
the Kohler & Chase piano, handled by
that firm in California. â¢ â¢ "The
Kohler & Chase uprights from the Bla
slus %vorks are made under a special
manufacturing contract with Kohler &
Chase, and in accordance with' the the
ories of the latter firm, which for more
than a half century has had the most
varied experience in the handling of
pianos of the very highest musical
type. Unbeknown to the firm I care
fully tested these Kohler & Chase pi
anos, and I would not hesitate for a
moment to guarantee them myself. No
one can discard them, no judge can af
ford to do so. for they are endowed
with a successful scale plan, and out of
this there issues a tone quality . that
commends Itself to the best musical
taste. The touch is as delicate and aa
responsive as a highly sensitive organ-
Ism of nature's own fabric, and I defy
the artistio musician who can play it
properly to get away from a Kohler &
Chase from his or her own impulse.
The piano holds and captivates the
player if he Is artistic.
In fact, the pianos are guaranteed by
Kohler & Chase. It is the name of
Kohler & Chase that brings the people
to look at the pianos, and It Is the en
ergy, and the resources and the reputa
tion and the knowledge of Kohler &
Chase that sell the pianos, and 'the
Kohler & Chase name then makes the
market. Under their factory title these
same pianos bring very high prices
wherever sold, Including California,
What are manufacturers going to "do
when the dealers will say, as they are
now going to say: "Give us pianos like
these Kohler & Chase; we will pay you
for them, for we can {safely sell such
pianos, with more excellence added to
our reputation. than ever before"? What
can the piano manufacturers; say. wheiij
this new, modern, common-sense prop
osition begins to unfold itself? Kohler
A Chase have demonstrated that they
can successfully handle large numbers
of .high-grade pianos with their name
on them â right on the fall-board. â¢ â¢ â¢
As sure as the hatched egg is riot fit
for an omelet, this talk of the dealer is
as sure to.come as a result of the Koh
ler & Chase. success with the high
grade, artistic pianos they are handling
with their names on them. The dealer,
seeing this Kohler & Chase success, is
not going to take the chances of: per-"
petuatlng his name on a cheap box; he
is going to put his name on pianos of
the high gradeâ the Kohler â& Chase
grade â for then he will be selling In
struments worth advertising; [ then he
can plan an advertising: campaign, for
the dissemination of such ; pianos will
add honor, distinction and profit to his'
business. â¢ â¢ â¢
There are many pianos â¢of â¢ the most
expensive class I would I not , have for
my own use, and I have seen pianos of
the same high-grade factories unfit for
artistic use .or musical expression.
Their names never guaranteed that
they were all \u25a0 of . equal merit because
the name on each was the same! .
A dealer handling high-grade pianos
with his name upon them can .pick thÂ«>
best examples of each lot, and Kohler
& Chasedo that very thing. >. They get
the choice. If a piano should happen to
come along which they could not guar
antee they, would either return; it to
the factory or take their name-oft and'
put on any assumed name 1 and: sell'. the
piano "as it Is"â that 'is,; af a low price
â or they. would rent It..' '
Each high-grade factory, through Its
valuable name,- represents ;. a -certain
class or type or standard, :biit" there are
many high-grade pianos that [ are < Indi
vidually unfit to rank- with the average/
In judging the piano and s not the" ; make
these unfit associates will : be elimi-;

NEW .YORK. Oct. 28.â With hatches
battened down and sulphur fumes flll
lng the hold of the British steamship
Sablne, Captain , Young:' and J the crew
of the vessel to-day anxiously watched
the extermination of the rats that
have made life a burden to all those
on the vessel since she sailed from
Java and until she made port here to
day. : \u25a0\u0084
Hardly : had the Sablne passed Singa
pore when* the first of the outbreaks
on the part of the rats manifested it
self. Sugar fumes evidently did not
agree with them, for they made for the
forecastle and even invaded the offi
cers' quarters, making It Impossible for
any one on board to sleep.
Captain Young received a deputation
of his men* as the ship was passing
through the Suez Canal. They demand
ed that sufficient oanvas be provided
them with which to make hammocks*.
The hammocks were made, but ' they
proved little better than bunks, for the
rats moved up the sides of the fore
castle Quarters , and down the ropes
that held the hammocks and aoon
reached the Bleeping: crew, sending
them yelling* from their suspended
couches. ;
All through the Mediterranean and
across the Atlantic the fight between
the crew and the rats continued.
Longshoremen quickly emptied the
ship to-day of her sugar cargo and
then sulphur was \u25a0 lighted ln the hold,
ln the forecastle and ln the officers'
Quarters and out poured the rats.

RENO, Oct. 28.â Mych excitement has
been caused among 1 the citizens of Reno
by the discovery that twelve acres gof
the most valuable property of the city is
unlocated. . The property is situated on a
small Island ln the Truckee River which
flows through the heart of the city. The
land for farming and agricultural pur

equaled in the vicinity of Reno and is
valued at $6000. It has been occupied by
squatters since the birth of the city. As
a result of; the discovery that the ground

WASHINGTON. Oct. 25.-Twenty-thou
s=and-t>')i battleships for the Unite-ii States
r.avy is a probability that may be realized
iti the next ftw years. Naval officers
say they are sure to come and ;Â» "U'ij
In this dirÂ«=ctior. will be taken this win
ttr by Congress in the cancelli - iij of thÂ«
authorization for two 1e.0.K1-ton vess-eis,
the Michigan and the South Carolina,
and providing ihat vhey be LB,OW-ton vos
seli.. Work on th*esp battleships has not
been begun, so that no ciiibara.^sment
vsiil be involved in the charge.
It is undprFtood that both the General
Board and Secretary Bonaparte will rec
or.rnend that the ,-har,ge be made.
At present no navy has a ship of 20.000
tens, but several, including Great Britain
end Japan, have one or more ships au
th.orized of 18,000 tons.
One grreat difficulty in the way of mak
ing vht Michigan and the South Carolina
of 18.00 ft lor.s is that the homeogenity of
the 16.000-ton squadron now provided
would be destroyed. Eight battleships
are expected to constitute thiH squadron
and it is desirable. :hat all be of the
s;;me type. Five of the Iti.OOO-ton type,
have been launched and one is now on
the stocks. Jf the tonnage of the re
maining two vessels be increased, the
fart that .th^y outclassed the other bat
tleships might provfl a source of diffi
culty in war.
"It will be a comparatively short time
whr-n there will be lÂ£,ooo-ton ships." said
a high naval officer to-day. "The six
battleships we are building will in three
or four years positively be inferior to
the 18.000-ton battleships of somebody
else. The Russo-Japanese war has shown
that the big ship wit'ti the big gun is the
one that does the. damage. What is
known to naval officers as gun economy
is an argument in favor of larger ships
and this could better be had by a 20,00-ton
than an 18,0<Â»-ton s\iip. My opinion is
that the Michigan and the South Caro
lina will be changed to the 18,000-ton
type and that six other vessels of that
kind will be built to complete the squad
ron."
VAN ALEN TO HAVE
A ROYAL BEDROOM
Single Apartment Will Cost
Millionaire Twenty-Five
Thousand Dollars.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDOX, Oct. 2S. â When Rushton
Hall. James Van Alen's place in
Northamptonshire, is thrown open for
public Inspection s.Â£ter the extensive
alterations, which are rapidly ap
proaching completion, a striking fea
ture will be a gorgeously furnished
bedroom. Schemes of fittings and dec
oration wen; originally invited from
some of the leading artists and archi
tects in the country, and after fruit
less efforts to find anything strikingly
original the new owner has decided to
adopt the state bedroom at Haddon
Hall, the Duke of Rutland's lovely seat
in Derbyshire, as a model
It is acknowledged that this partic
ular room is one o( the most luxurious
and artistic of its kind in Europe and
that even the King's palaces cannot
produce anything like it. The wood
work is of richly carved oak inlaid in
parts with ivory, while the hangings
are of the richest Oriental designs. If
It were possible Van Alen would go
one better, but experts in furnishing
and decorating declare that it is impos
sible to improve on the Haddon Hall
chamber unless it is reduced to a freak
apartment.
Van Alen, who has an artistic tem
perament, will not do this, bo he is sat
isfied to be at least equal to the Duke
of Rutland. The Haddon Hall room is
exclusively retained for the use- of
sovereigns, a. Prince even would not be
allowed to repose there.
There is as yet no positive Indication
that Van Alen will be honored by roy
alty at Rushton Hall, but his neigh
bors are satisfied that some very dis
tinguished people will visit there next
year. It is for the use of such distin
guished persons that the bedroom has
been constructed' and designed and it
is to be as exclusive in a sense as the
Haddon Ha*l apartment. When it is
finally fitted it will, according to the
lowest estimate,* have cost $25,000.
Equal to the Occasion.
The Worcestershire defendant, fined 10
shillings for driving without a light, who
has Insisted 'jpon paying his fine In cop
pers because he considered It a "rotten
affair," has his precedent In the tradition
of an Oxford undergraduate whom the
proctor fined 5 shilling for some breach
of university law. He also brought out
the money in coppers with a view to
"scoring off" the proctor, but the latter
was equal to the occasion. "By all means,
Mr. ," he said, "only I must trouble
you to bring me fi penny at a time at 9
o'clock every morning until the whole
sum is paid." â London Chronicle.

OFFICER KILLS
A SALOON MAN
Davisville Liquor Dealer,
Who Recently Lost License,
Is Shot by a Constable
SACRAMENTO, Oct. 28.â A special dis
patch from Davisville' says: John Caul
field, a former saloon-keeper at this place,
was shot by Constable "W. S. Hainline
about 8:30 o'clock to-night and expired a
half hour later.
Caulfi eld, whose saloon license was re
voked by the Board of Supervisors three
or four weeks ago because he violated the
Sunday closing ordinance, s drank heavily
to-day and" celebrated ;bis'j condition by
going to the rear of , his old . saloon and
beginning a bombardment \u25a0at the clouds
with his revolver. \u25a0 Constable ;' Hainline
heard the shooting 1 and; going: to the
rear of thelsaloon induced /Caul field 'to
cease firing. :,-\u25a0.'â¢' -" \u25a0"."-'\u25a0 ; '\u25a0'â¢â¢ ! -- '\u25a0; "' .' : ' \u25a0'\u25a0 ,:
A short time later Caulfield opened up
the saloon and 'announced' the :â¢ fact \u25a0by
again opening fire with j his revolver."
Hainllne again interfered, going into, the
saloon. He ordered Caulfield to put away
hi 3 weapon,' stop- shooting and dose up
the saloon. % \u25a0 :
Caulfield did not; like the interference.
Hq ordered Hainline out of the place, in
forming him that It was private property,
and i that | unless â¢he S left immediately \ he
would shoot him.'
Hainline started toward the door, and
as he neared it Caulfield fired at him, 1 the
bullet, according cto report, passing close
to Hainline's head. Hainline wheeled and
returned "the, fire, the bullet striking Caul
field in the stomach. He fell to the floor
and thirty minutes later expired. ..,, -*

DEATH OF PAPOOSE
MAY MEAN A WAX
Resumption of Strife Be-*
tween Two Nevada Tribes
Is Expected.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
RENO. Oct. 28.â Late last night the
remains of an Indian baby In a basket
and wrapped in . blankets and clothes
were discovered ,by Arthur Raymond
and James Gibbs about two miles north
of the city.' They were brought to this
city by" Coroner Read : this morning.
The flesh had all been eaten from the
skeleton and the clothes and blankets
Jn which the. child had been wrapped
were torn and gnawed by wild animals
In their efforts to eat the body/ The
clothes and" blankets were saturated
with blood, showing, that the child had
in, all probability, met with a violent
death.
The cause ; of the young \u25a0 papoose's
death has not yet been determined, but
it is thought by the Indians and. many
white people' that its end was the re
sult of a feud, between two Indian fam
ilies of the Plute and Washoe tribes.
These tribes . have been warring con
tinuously for one | hundred years. Re
cently the hatchet was ; buried. There
are ! a few discontented ones In both
tribes who did not favor this action,
and the death of the babe is thought
to be the result. It- may mean the
resumption of strife.

LADY MAITLAND
VISITS AMERICA
Viscount ; s Wife Will Paint
Portraits of Members of
the President's Family
LONDON. Oct. 28.â Lady" Maitland, who
is again visiting. In America, accompanied
this time by her husband., Viscount Malt
land, has received several handsome com
missions for miniature paintings to be
executed during her stay on the other
side of the Atlantic. I have it on the
best authority that among them are or
ders from President Roosevelt for, pic
tures of his wife, his eldest daughter,
Miss Alice Roosevelt, and. other.: members'
of his familyâ in all six portraits.
Lady Maitland Is an accomplished min
iature painter whose success can in no
wise be attributed to her rank. Her por
traits of pretty women especially have
been greatly admired and have been ex
hibited in the Royal Academy. She Is
proficient In several of the lesser arts,
trims hats, designs gowns, and excels In
the tasteful arrangement of interiors.
It Is necessity that impels her to make
money by painting miniatures. Viscount
Maitland is one of : the comparatively
"hard up" members of the" , British peer
age, but for all that he and his charming
wife have always managed v to:keep in the
front rank of London society. She' Is a
tall, slender, graceful woman,' with that
much admired shade of . reddish hair
which not a few less fortunate memberb
of the fair sex seek to- acquire by arti
ficial means. ' Lord Maitland Is big and
burly, and. is regarded "as a thoroughly
good fellow by his friends. He ranked at
one time as. the . best amateur .: pho
tographer In England,' but since" -he has
opened a studio in Sloans street he Is now,
classed as a professional. He never made
any secret of his desire to make money,
out of his camera/and as the aristocracy!
takes sensible views of such' matters
nowadays he can do it without ' losing
caste. \u25a0 My latest" memory of Lord Mait
land Is seeing him In an art gallery, .the'
day before /a private view, working "hard
in his shirt sleeves, arranging his own
photographic exhibit on the walls. -.
He and Lady Maitland are" both'greatly
Interested in Christian -; science. One "of
the merits claimed; for. that; form ;"of ifalth
Is that it I? peculiarly efficacious- in mak

GRETNA GREEN
AGAIN TO FORE
Run away Marriages Across
Border Once More Grow
Popular, in Great Britain
EDINBURGH. Oct. 28.â Gretna Green,
the little Scotch village just-across the
border from Cumberland, Is witnessing a
revival of the weddings which made it
famous In the romantic days .of yore.
One Peter Dlxon, a carpenter, Is playing
the role of the blacksmith of tradition,
and so well does it pay. him that he has
abandoned his trade to devote himself ex
clusively, to the tying of nuptial knots
for couples who are In a hurry to, get
"spliced."
Dixon was seen In a public house,. the
center of an admiring throng of. villagers.
Ho la a good type, of the canny Scot, of
middle Bge, with shrewd eyes, 'iron gray
hair and a mouthY screened by a full
beard that can well keep Its owner's own
counsel. He was not at all adverse to
drinking at a stranger's expense, v but not
even Scotch whisky, that most potent en
courager of loquacity, could Induce him
to bo communicative about his singular
occupation. â¢
"I don't want anything published In the
papers about my business,','; he said. t:
"But publicity would Increase your busi
ness." was suggested, ".- ,',.-.'. \u25a0
. "It might,", he admitted, ."but it might
also increase competition, and _ I don't
want any other folks setting up in the
same line here. There ain't any more In
it than just keeps me going comfortably,
and as I started it, I think I'm, entitled
to all there is in. it."
"Are you a -minister?" was asked. \
"No, I ain't," he answered; "You don't
have, to be a parson to i marry folk; in
Scotland. I can 'tie 'em together just as
hard and fast as any minister In , the" land.

PRISON BOARD
HOLDS MEETING
Recommends Pardon for
Paroled Convict and On
for Aged Mexican Murderer
VALLEJO MAN SUFFERS
Mis behaves Himself While
Out on a Permit and Now
Must Serve Full Term
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN QUENTIN, Oct. Â£S.â The Board of
Prison Directors veld' its monthly
meeting here to-day. Directors Dev-.
lin, Ford, Felto"n and Wilkins were
present. The ' forenoon was taken up
with the consideration of routine busi
ness and matters pertaining to the new
work about to be commenced. The
afternoon session- was a' short one. at
which many applications for . parole
were considered. .
The board recommended to Governor
Pardee that a pardon be granted to
"Joe" Harveston, who was sent here in
IS9S to serve a fourteen-year sentence
for; mayhem. He was paroled two
years ago and is now. a member of the
Board of Trade of Santa Crua.
In response to a communication from
tht: Governor" asking 'whether the
board would recommend the pardon of
J. J. Alvarez, a Mexican subject, who
has served twenty-five years of a life
sentence' for murder committed in San
Diego, the board answered in the-af
firmative.. Dr. Plutarco Ornelas. the
Mexican Consul, has interested him
self In' the old man's case. If par
doned he will be sent to Mexico to: his
friends.
The board approved the estimates
and plans for changing the fire and
bathing system from fresh to sail
water, the approximate cost being
?S4OO. It also ordered Ihe printing of
the schedules for supplies to be 'ad
vertised for. The bids will be adver
tised for when the ' schedules are
printed. . . . â¢ -Sv^'
James M. Oliver was re-elected, clerk
of the prison for a term of four years,
commencing with September 15, 1903.
Michael Stokes, serving a twenty
year sentence for robbery committed
in Siskiyou in IS3S was paroled. A. J.
Mi'llen, the. San Jose Deputy Tax Col
lector who embezzled J2400 and is
serving a three-year, sentence, also was
paroled.
William J. Stan ton and Frank Hayes,
who broke their -paroles and were re
turned to prison, were deprived of their
credits, earned arid unearned. Stanton
Is- serving a twenty-five-year- sentence
for murdering his mistress in -Vallejo.
A ftfr ''. serving nine years he was
paroled, although there was strong ob
jection raised. Since his release he. has
abused the parole law and now lie has
to serve fifteen years and seven months
'more. He has lost nine years and nine
months.' credits by disobeying the law.
Director Felton. after making a close
inquiry into the proposed change in
visiting days, \u25a0 introduced a resolution
making each Saturday visiting , day
and allowing a visitor to see a convict
friend or relative only once a month.
The board adopted the resolution. As
it now stands convicts can see their
relatives or friends on Saturday Instead
of tli'e first and third Sunday of the
month and parties can go through the
prison on Thursdays. The board ; de
cided that Sunday was a bad day . for
.visitors, as there \u25a0is always a large
number of undesirable visitors on that
day, w-ho disobey. the rules and act un
becomingly.
little Dumfries village of Gretna Green
fell, back into the native obscurity \u25a0 out,of
4 whlch a most singular fortune had tem
porarily dropped it, and from which it
is, now again emerging. Up to the year
1754. there was no need for a couple of
English lovers to be scampering off to
Scotland to get married. Ever sine* the
Reformation had repudiated the Council
of Trent, and most of Its doings, English
practices in the matter of marriages had
been growing more and more lax and ir
regular. To put . an end to the scandal
the Marriage Act of 1754 was passed. IC
required ? all: persons except Jews and
Quakers to get married, If at all. in- a
Church of " England and according to
the Church of England, ritual.
A great many people resented the nev/
law and as it did not apply to Scotland,
the most obvious way . to escape It was
to flit across the border. "â But flight was
not always easy. Numerous stories were
told of sensational chases, of broken down
vehicles, of barricaded roads, and of the
horses of pursuing carriages being shot
to give gay Lotharios in front just time
to get over the bridge into the land of
liberty. When the names of .great lords
and ladles began to be mixed ,up with
such romances, weddings at Gretna Green
began to be almost as fashionable as are
now those > at : St. â George's,' Hanover
Square.
Fifty such marriages In the course, of
a month ' were by no means ; unusual at
one time. Among :the earliest recorded
marriages at Gretna was' that of Richard
Avnell Edgworth who, in -..the -course of
his eccentric career, married four wives,
6ne of , them a deceased wife's sister, and
had nineteen children, among them. Maria
Edgworth, the novelist. .Then followed
several . lords, among> whom were I Broug
ham, Eldon, \u25a0 \u25a0 Dundonald and Erskine, be
sides many scions of noble and- disthv
guished houses. â¢ . .
The little .village to which
these infatuated folk': made a dash, some
of them with indignant -parents and
"uardians at .their heels, , is a , dull little

ENGLAND PttEFEKS
THE FEMALE ANGEL
Takes Up the Discussion Be
gun in the United
States.
Special Dispatch to ThÂ» Call.
LONDON, Oct. 2S.â Few of the monu
ments in St. Paul's Cathedral and
Yv'estminster Abbey would escape muti
lation if it were decided to emulate the
example of the ecclesiastical authori
ties of the Cathedral of St. John the
Divine, New York, and exclude female
angel.. Most of. those that appear in
the two famous Valhallas of England,
offering laurel wreaths and other con
solatory emblems to prostrate heroes,
are of the feminine persuasion. ..
Whatever, may be, the opinions of
ecclesiologists as , to whether or no
there is scriptural sanction for It, there
can be no doubt that the glorified
woman with pinions Is the popular type
of angel in England.
The controversy regarding . the sex
of angels, which SignorÃorgium's de
struction of his rejected statuary has
precipitated on the other ?. side. ha 3
aroused keen interest here.
"Angels," says one artist. who makes
a specialty,of them, "should.- be regard
ed as a distinct order; of beings, not as
human beings promoted, to .a. higher
state, . and therefore it is not at all
illogical to regard them as sexless.
Artists have always' found a- difficulty
in depictinga satisfactory angel. It is
hot easy to combine the virile strength
and power of the masculine character
with the gracefulness, the refinement
and the spirituality of the feminine.
There are very; few artists* living or
dead whose types of : angels are con
vincing; To my mind Botticelli is far
more successful with, his angels than
any other artist, and he has combined
the two natures in an exquisite blend.
The correct angel nowadays is quite
sexless."
The sexless v angel represents, a com
promise. Most of the clerics here who
have been interviewed on the subject
stand out for unmistakable masculine
angels and repudiate the feminine type
utterly as contrary, to scripture. But
as long as most folk prefer the female
angel on mortuary monuments, female
angels will continue to be produced.
It is not likely, however, that any more
of them will be added to the collections
in St. Paul's and Westminster Abbpy
for the reason that here Is no more
room for them.

In the lowly tomato lurks an enemy
to the senses, the golden pumpkin leadi jj
a double life . and the watermelon j|
in its luscious breast bears a thunder
bolt. These horrible facts are revealed
by a news message from Oklahy.n-;
which tells. that "a farmer living nean
Prague" has made whisky from theso
vegetablesâ by the way. Is a water
melon a vegetable or a fruit? But. any
way, how are we going to , keep thi
pesky lid on if you can make whisky
out of every fruit and vegetable that
grows? Deny a thirsty soul the privi
leges of the common bar and ho will gu
and acquire a" home-made jag of di*.
tressing quality, if ho can get hold of
a vegetable of some kind. â Globe Dem

street, in payment, for his board and
lodging. He expected that Montgomery
would give him the balance in cash;
But Montgomery called at the flrm'i
warehouse- \u25a0 yesterday .morning and
learned that the firm's signature had
been forged. He notified the police and
Oubridge was arrested by Policeman
McMurray. He will be with
attempting to pass a forged check un
less it may develop that he hai forged
and passed checks on other people,'
when the more serious charge of for
gery would be 'made against him.
Oubridge came into prominence here
in 1892 by posing as the son of an
English nobleman. He cut a wide
swath In the red light district and his
career was cut, short by his arrest on
a charge of forgery. He was tried and
convicted and sentenced to serve three
years in San Quentin. On November 20,'
189", he was sentenced to serve six
months in the County Jail on a charge
of passing a fictitious check. He next
appeared in Oakland, where he caused
quite a stir by again posing as the son
of a nobleman till he was arrested for
forgery and on April 8, 1899, he was
sentenced to serve ten years in Folsom
penitentiary. "While serving his six
months' term for passing a fictitious
check he was employed as a "trusty" In
the City Prison.
WO3Fx\N SAYS UMPIRE
EMBEZZLED HER PIN
"Slats" -Davis Is Arrested and
Released on His Own
Recognizance.
Miss Bee Frances Rose, who'keeps a
lodging-house at 624 Geary street, ap
peared before Police Judge Mogan yes
terday and swore to a complaint
charging J. Ira Davis, the baseball um
pire, familiarly known to the fraternity
as "Slats," with felony embezzlement.
She 'said she had known Davis for
many years, and on tJctober N l, while
they were dining together at Tait's he
took a diamond stickpin valued at $75
from the neck of her dress. She. did
not miss it at the time, but when she
did she accused Davis of taking it and
asked him for its return. She alleges
he did not deny taking it, and said,
"Never mind, kid; I'll wear it for a
while and gfve it to you back all
right." \u25a0\u25a0 \u25a0\u25a0.
She said she had made demands for
its return since that time, but Davis
refused to part with it. "It isn't the
first thing he has taken from me during
the years I have known him," said Miss
Rose, "and it is about time, to call a
halt." , \u25a0
Davis was arrested after the game,
but immediately released on his own
recognizance. A big husky j cop was |
waiting throughout the struggle to
pinch the Indicator man, yet he went
about his business as though nothing
was wrong.
Davis said he bought the stone from
a friend in an Ellis-street saloon ' last
May and later sold it back. Davis- said
that shortly after he was married ha .
saw the Jewel In a Portland loan office
and again purchased it, paying $13 50. ,
He denies having taken it from the '
woman and insists' that a mistake has >
been made. . \u25a0 i
POLICE COMPLAIN ALLEGED
ROBBER'S VICTIM IS INSOLEXT
Prank D. Hushes Declares He was
â¢ Held Up and $200. In Gold
Taken From Him.
Dr. Jerome A. Hughes, 1821 Eddy
street, called at the O'Farrell-street
police station 1 about 1:30 o'clock yes
terday morning and reported that his
brother, Frank D., living at 1304 Ma
sonic avenue, had been - held up and
robbed at Waller street and Masonic
avenue. . <
Policemen Doherty. Hurley, Mylar
and Maas were detailed to make an
investigation. They found j Frank
Hughes in the kitchen of his house
and when he was asked about the al
leged hold-up he replied that it was
none of their business and he did not
know what they wanted in his house,
as he had not sent for them. Finally
he said the footpad had struck him on
the head with a revolver and had taken
$200 in gold from his pockets. The
only description he could give of the
robber was that he wore a light- cap,
was about 5 feet 8 inches tall and of
stout build.
Hughes had a contusion on hiÃ fore
head and his ear was lacerated. The
policemen reported that he was under
the influence of liauor and very inso
lent in his demeanor. They searched
the neighborhood, but could find no
trace of a footpad.:

"NICKEL NOVELS" CRITICIZED
BY POLICE JUDGE MOGAN
Two of Them Found
in Juvenile's
Possession.
Also a Big Pistol
in; Good Shape
for Work.
Error of His Way
Explained to
the Youth.
BY JAMES C. CRAWFORD.
Ralph Amarose,* agsd seventeen years,
professed inability to explain just why
he was armed with a large and fully,
load ;d revolver when Patrolman Sprln
gett overhauled him at Kearny and Val
lejo streets. In his possession at the
same time, however, were two "Nickel
Novtls," embellished with garish pic
tures of thrilling situations, and the
quality of the literature must have con
veyed to Police Judge Mogan a compre
hensive hint as to the make-up of Master
Amarose's .controlling ambition, for he
asked:
"Who were you going gunning for. on
tho.Barbary Coastâ the wicked abductor
of the gentle heroine or . the even-more
unscrupulous villain who murdered your
father, burled the, will and ousted little
sister and you from the old homestead?"
So clearly did Master Amarose's coun
tenance reflect an absolute lack of un
derstanding that his Honor hastened to
simplify the query:'
"One of 'the works of fiction found in
your, pockets is now. before me. It's .title
is 'Steel-Nerved Sam, or Might is Right'
â no, /Ri.sht is Might'â and a hasty scan
ning of its pages informs me that its
hero, accompanied by a six-shooter, is
on the' track of a fiend in human form.
Was it in emulation of Steel-Nerved Sam
that you buckled on this formidable wea
ponâwhy, there are three nicks in its
handle! What do they represent? So
many scoundrels that have fallen "before
your unerring aim?"
"No; rabbits," replied Master Amarose.
"Indeed? But as to your armed mis
sion oh the Coastâ what . was it?"
'Twas then that Master Amarose ex
pressed his inability to explain. It just
happened that he had the firearm; and
it just happened that he was Coast-bound
when -the policeman "nailed" him; â¢
"But why did it just happen that you'
carried such a â murderous .weapon?" the
court inquired. /\^<-
To shoot rabbits. Of course .there were
no wild rabbits in the vicinity, of : Kearny
and VallejoV streetsâ everybody: knew that
âbut Master Amarose did not- spend all
his time there. And a pistol was a handy
thing to have when one r went a-strolling
where rabbits did run wild. â¢"â¢\u25a0 .
"Before pronouncing you : guilty,- of 'car-;

that of peace disturbance.

family feuds that can only be settled
by wide separation of the belligerents,"

COLLINS FLIES
INTO A FRENZY
Georse D. Collins found a foeman
worthy .of his ! steel at , the tantalizing
game In District Attorney Byington
yesterday during the hearinar " of -thw
perjury case. â¢ The accused attorney
was taunted into a momentary frenzy.
It was when Collins was reading an
affidavit â one of a maze of these docu- .
mentsâ that Bylngton caught him in an
exposed spot. In reading the affidavit
which he had prepared in support of
his motion for a change o^ venue,
Collins spoke of his wife.
"That is indefinite.',' drawled the Dis
trict Attorney. "I would ask the court
to ask whom he means." I
"You do so at your peril, sir," shout
ed Collins.
"I' will state." continued Bylngton, \u25a0;
"that we recosrnlze but one person as '.
his wife. Charlotte E. Collins." - j
George D. Collins -twent white with !
rage, and , was about , to make a retort
when Judge Lonnon sternly command
ed silence. â¢
Counter affidavits from Judge Law
lor.l Judge Lennon and the District At
torney, were filed in the morning deny
ing : the allegations presented by Col
lins* affidavit of the preceding: day.
Judge Lawlor, declared,', further, that
Jacob \u25a0â¢ Meyer, a clerk in Collins' office,
who declared that \u25a0\u25a0- he represented his
employer, gave assurance that he would
be satisfied with Judge Lawlor or any
Judge whom he might appoint, with
one exception. .
Meyer \ could not be located < yester
day,; but * Collins declares that his affi
davit denyinjr liawlor's; statement will
be- produced Monday.
; Collins, after being : turned! down in
an effort- to have Judge : Lennon and
Judge Lawlor called to the witness i
stand,, consumed the greater part of
the afternoon in a lengthy oration. His â¢
eloquence was mainly devoted to dis- j
paraging \u25a0 J udge 'Lawlor.
.: In Judge'Lawlor's affidavit was set
forth .a .letter received -from Collins
while the latter, was in Victoria.' The
epistle asks thatthe charge of -perjury
be ! dismissed Vas an act \u25a0of simple Jus
tice." Many alleged precedents for such
action ; are cited. - : Collins ; declared 'in
the^ letter that .he \ intended going to
Toronto to practice law as; soon as' the
proceedings were dismissed.' Evidently
he became ' tired 'of : Canada * soon after

that: he. .intended -to -, remain -in the-!

STEADY AND SURE GAINS FOR FUSION
PROSPECTS FOR SWEEPING VICTORY FOR JOHN S. PARTRIDGE ARE GROWING BRIGHTER EVERY HOU.
Utmost confidence in the election of John S. Partridge and the , entire fusion ticket
prevails in the joint campaign committee of Republicans and Democrats. There .is posi
tive proof that the grafters are weakening, Stories told on the streets of immense sums
of money to wager at odds on the election of Ruef's candidate are found on investigation
to be pure fakes. v''*p
Fusion Leader Speaks to Many Work
insmen at Pacific Mail Dock.
Enthusiastic Crowd Greets Candidate
at the Builders' Association.
Two noontime meetings were ad
dressed by John S. Partridge yester
day In totally different parts of the
city before different audiences and both
were well attended. At both the can
didate was listened to with attention
fcr.d received great applause and assur
ances of votes.
The first meeting was held at the Pa
cific Mail dock, where 400 men who
earn their living along San Francisco's
water front listened to the candidate
for over half an hour. Once or twice
there were occasional questions ad
dressed to the speaker by Ruef sup
porter* In the crowd, but barring that
there was no Interruption. At the con
clusion of his address the water front
workers gave Mr. Partridge several
cheers.
In the course of his remarks Mr.
Partridge told them of the attitude of
Ruef and Schmitz toward the cause of
labor. He told them of the many in-
stances when both politicians threw
down the labor organizations when
â¢ their own interests were jeopardized.
[He told them of the attitude of the
j boss and his man on the improving of
I the city and then told of the graft
that extends throughout the municipal
departments from the Mayor's office
down to, the smallest commission.
The second meeting of the day was
'a large gathering at the Builders' As
sociation at SIS Bush street, where a
large crowd gathered shortly after
noon. Long before Mr. Partridge ap
peared the hall was packed and the
stairway and entrance tv the building
were also crowded. After being pre
sented by President F. 11. (Jualman, Mr.
Piirtrid^e told his hearers of the ef
forts to dispose of the city's bonds. Ho
also told th<?ui of the graft in the
Board of Public Works and of the fa
voritism shown protege* of the admin
istration. A ijthinitz sympathizer tnen
created a laugh by calling for three
cheers for the Ituef candidate. He
was the only one to respond to nls own
call. \u25a0 /'..-',
DESTROYS CIVIL SERVICE.
j Mr. Partridge spoke in part as fol
lows:
While tlie Mayor was not in control of the
various departments, he vetoed numerous ap
propriations :or salaries cr civil service men.
claiming ihat the iwsiilons were not necessary,
but whm the departments passed under his
bill control In January. IUO3. civil service em
ployes were dischai-ged wherf-ver possible, and
supporters of tht political machine, which is
Â«it>Â»>ervient to the boes who controls the- ad
ministration, were provided with political jobs.
The most brazen assault on the merit system
was made in the Department of Health, where
practically every employe in the offices, labora
tories and bureaus, in the hospital and Alms
;. houre arid In the emergency hospitals were dts
j charged.
* To rave th* remnants of civil service from
annihilation, the Board of Supervisors, In the
ordinance fixing the financial budget for the
year J904-05, provided that all employe* whope
< .saJariff were therein fixed should be civil sen-
Ice men. The Auditor was r.utlfied In the or
dinance that the appropriations for these eal
arits and wagea were made solely for employes
appointed from the civil service H'.glble lists.
Id acconianc-e with the charter. The purpose
of ; tW* notification was to stop payment
of the salaries or wages of persons who had
<- received appointments contrary to law. The
Mayor vetoed all these appropriations, but the
badÂ£( t was parsed over the veto, and to that
Â«vtent at least civil service wa* saved from
the assaults of the administration.
PRETENDED EXAMINATIONS.
It then became Imperative to put civil serv
ice men Sn the various positions that had been
Clcbed from the merit eyetem. The temporary
*-mpltyes in some of the offices and the '"push"
holding Jobs under evasive declinations of
their positions wÂ»-re given pretended and col
lusive examinations and all of them
wer* kept In the ponitlons they held. This was
accomplished by allowing 60 per cent for ex
perience, which only the appointees of the axl
jciniftration possessed. The commission also
passed on the physical condition of applicant?.
and allowed whatever percer.tatre thÂ«?y pleated.
Withal the Civil Service Commission sub
mitted a report for the fiscal year ending
Juse 30. 1905. showing that TÂ»7 civil service
appointments were made during the year. Of
that cumber 211 are street sweepers. The
total amount of applicants examined was but
985. There were but 358 appointees taken from
the eligible lists established from examlna-
I.on*. but the report does not state how the
rest of the appointment* w*re made. Of the
candidate* examined In the year most of them
**ere policemen and firemen, who took the ex
amination* for promotions. The remainder
k.were for pupil nurses, eewer men, Janitors,
street sweepers and a few employes of the
Health office.
'\u25a0'\u25a0â¢f.,\ DOUBLES THE ROLL.
ThÂ« Auditor is credited with 121 appointees.
Ik* Auditor never ha* more than fifty men
employed, even at the time when he was ex
tendlnc the assessment roll. He employs
about fifty men twice a year for a few weeks,
\u2666and these are the 121 appointees of the oivll
service report. The same men, being what are
c>slgna.ted In the charter "ordinary clerki,"
are temporarily employed in the tax office
and * the election office and in other places,
yet they are set down for each office as dif
ferent individuals. The election office Is cred
ited with fifty-one, the tax office with flfty
nijc â the came "ordinary cierks" who are given
ehort employment la different offices. Tbt
Board of Health, Is credited with twenty-two.
most of whom are pupil nurses entering the
hospital. The- Board of Public Works appar
ently rot S.V) civil service employe* In the
year, yet the books show that there Is no
change In the names of employes in that de
partment.
In addition to all these thins* the adminis
tration has even stooped to the petty trick of
making temporary appointments from month
to month la order to avoid the civil service
provisions of the charter. The charter pro
vide* that temporary Â»ppolntmenu may be
made, and the administration has taken ad
vantage of that and appoint* its favorite
anew each month. Meanwhile the Civil Service
Cotcmitslon Is costing the taxpayer about
f I^,ooo a year. . and all that the commission
loea is to epend ltc time devising ways and
means of avoiding and rendering of no effect
the very statute which created It.
SUPPORTING BRAXDEXSTKI.V
Bla Honenty and excellent Record
Brlnic I<abor>nsr Men to Him Aid.
In order to more energetically and
more systematically- conduct the can
didacy of Henry U.- Brandensteln for
.the office of District Attorney, active
yfctamp&lgn committees have been ap
pointed In every district In the city.
Because of the unblemished record
which the Joint Democratic and Re
, publican nominee for District Attorney
made while serving the people as a Su
pervisor and because of the fact that
whenever the occasion arose he treat
ed laboring men with fairness and Jus
tice, labor union men all over the city
are rallying to his support. The labor
union men. desiring to show that they
can appreciate the efforts made by Mr.
Brandensteln in their behalf, are ably
assisting in his campaign under the
leadership of Robert J. Loughery, who
was one of the leaders of the Porters'
and Packers' Union- during the jjreat
teamsters' strike.
In making his campaign the friends
of the fusion candidate for District At
torney point out that In the whole six
years of his official life he never at
any time did a single act that can now,
In the heat of the present campaign, be
brought up against him. His sntiro
official career has been one of conscien
tious devotion to public duty. He has
spared no efforts to advance the inter
ests of this, his native city, and as
chairman of the Finance Committes of
the Board of Supervisors, he .ia.3 In
sisted on the practice of strict econ
omy in the handling of municipal
finances.
Besides being qualified by his pub
lic record for the position to which he
aspires, he Is also abundantly qualified
as an attorney. Before he entered pub
lic life Mr. Brandenstein had consider
able experience practicing in thy crim
inal court* of this city. The records
in Judge Dunne's court show, that In
that department of the Superior Court
alone he had numerous criminal cases
and conducted them with praiseworthy
ability.
VOTING MACHINE SAFK.
Public Tent Provr* That It Cannot Be
.Manipulated.
The United States Standard voting
machine' was gfven'a pirbllc'test in the
assembly-room of the Board of Super
visors last night and it was shown to
the satisfaction of all present that the
machine could not be tampered with.
A Grand Jury committee, consisting of
George W. Caswell, R. L. Radke and
W. H. Leahy, attended the test.' They
expressed themselves perfectly satisfied
with it.
There were a few spectators in the
crowd who thought they could eas
ily annex the $1000 purse offered 'to
any one who can manipulate the ma
chine. One of these wise gentlemen
found out that he could turn the party
lever without ringing the bell, but he
was shown that he could only vote
once and that he would have to sound
the bell before he could register ! the
Vote. . .
The Election Commissioners have ex
tended invitations to thje Grand Jurors
to be present when the machines are
finally sealed. Any other organization
that wishes to send representatives to
this function is invited to do so.
The machines will be taken^ to the
different booths on Friday, Saturday
and Monday. On Monday the repre
sentatives of the company, the Elec
tion Commissioners and the Grand Jury
committee will visit each machine at
the booths, to make sure that every
thing is correct and that the machines
are in perfect working order.
A school of instruction to show the
election officers how to open the ma
chines for votlrjg has been established
Jn the Registrar's Office. The two
principal officers of each precinct have
been ordered to attend. '
When the crowd was satisfied that
the voting machine was proof against
any tampering, except with dynamite
or a jimmy, Frank Jordan, represent
ing the company, explained its work
ings.

Appeal, However, on Ground of
Once In Jeopardy.
Frank Ballard, alias Alan Dale,
known In police circles as "the knock
out drops man," was convicted" by a
jury in Judge Dunne's court on Fri
day night on a charge of robbery. He

Supreme Court and the judgment was
reversed on a technicality. \u25a0 â¢
When the second trial commenced
on Friday morning the defendant's at
torney entered a plea of once In jeop
ardy, but it was overruled. He lnti r
mated that if a verdict of guilty was
rendered against the defendant he
would apply to the Supreme Court for
a writ of habeas corpus for his release
from custody on the ground that the
defendant was not granted a new trial,
but the judgment was reversed.

GROSSLY NEGLECTED
John S. Partridge to Speak
in the Twenty - Eighth
District To-Morrow Night
at Workingmen's Meeting
Report comes to fusion headquarters
that the Board of Election Commission
ers is citing well known citizens to ap
pear and show cause why they registered
in San Francisco this year. It is true
that many citizens who are actively
engaged in mercantile, manufacturing
and professional pursuits in San
Francisco have- decided to register
and vote here. In ample time, under
the urovisions of law, they can
celed their registrations in Oakland, Ala
meda and Berkeley, and "registered in
this. city. ..They conduct extensive busi
ness enterprises here and jay taxes to
support the local government. It is their
right and duty to register and vote in
San Francisco. - â¢ , ,
I /There is a wide field for proper and per
tinent investigation by the election board
in the registrations accredited to lodging
houses of the Twenty-eighth, Twenty
ninth. Forty-third, Forty-fourth and For
ty-fifth Assembly districts, but the com
missioners seem to be fighting shy of
their duty in that direction ' and giving
their special attention to schemes to
harass and badger well known citizens
and tax payers. Let the corrmlssloners
live up to their recently signed public
declaration and give all the voters a
square deal.
There is suspicion that the board Is
devising means to delay thÂ« mailing of
sample ballots, so that a plea can be
made later on that the return envelopes
were not delivered to the Registrar in
time for cancela'tton.
The Knights of the Royal Arch, Cali
fornia Liquor Dealers' Association, and
the San Francisco Retail Grocers' Asso
ciation announce through Heiry A. Keel
er, secretary, that a mass meeting
of retail liquor dealers and thsse affiliated
with the traffic will be held at Alhambra
Theater, Tuesday, October 31, at 2 p.m.,
to discuss "High License." The an
nouncement says: "This meeting is 'not
in the interest of any candidate." \u0084. ,
\u25a0 Rev. A. C. Bane, pastor of the Howard
street Methodist Church, announces that
he will speak this evening at his church
on "High License." He promises to pre
sent Important data bearing on the prop
osition.
The fusion campaign' committee,
which is conducting the battle to oust
the grafters from power, is not con
tending for or against.- high license.
Citizens will vote on this proposition
as their sense of duty directs. The com
mittee is advising citizens to redeem
San Francisco from the curse of graft
and boodle. That is the issue of the
hour.
The liquor dealers are having quite
an experience in this campaign. Agents
of graft and boodle are holding them
up for campaign contributions to per
petuate the reign of, Ruef. The notion
\u25a0 is entertained by many people that a
j properly conducted saloon, where one
J may read the newspapers und gossip
with his fellow workers over a glass
of beer. Is a poor man's club and should
not be taxed out of. existence..; Many
such saloons are conducted by the
liquor dealers of San Francisco and
man only are the customers. But there
are other places.
Complaint comes to The Call from
residents' of the Mission .that Basslty's
place at Fifteenth and Valencia streets
is an example of what a saloon ought
not to be., A leading citizen of the Mis
sion saicl to The Call yesterday:
"Basslty's place is a hell hole. It is
in the heart, of the Mission, next to the
Episcopal church. The proprletortells
the young men whO\ frequent the place
that he will be compelled to close up if
Schmitz Is defeated and that If Schmitz
wins out a 'dance halT will be opened.
Under present conditions the- carousals
continue until long after midnight.
Liquor is freely sold to young girls.
The people of the Mission who; are
bringing up families view tho place
with abhorrence." '"â¢*.
, The practice of selling whisky by the
drink to young girls Is as revolting to
the legltimato liquor dealers as It 'is
to other men. The Knights -of- the
Royal Arch at their meeting next Tues
day may deal with this branch of the
subject: .J; ;. ' '

SNED IGAR'S GREAT SPRINT RESULTS IN A TOUCHDOWN FOR CALIFORNIA
/ ----- - â -----
Williams Tears Up
After the Speedy
Halfback-
Force Makes a Field
Goal During the
First Half.
PARK WINSLOW
I Sprint racing was one of the most
-prominent features of the entertain
'nient -provided by the University of
California and the Oregon Agricultural
College iootball teams on the gridiron
at Berkeley yesterday. Two leu-second
*nie:i Â«rÂ«re putea against each other for
a sixiy-yird run and wtiile the race
â¢was on ihe immense crowd was as
EiUi.t as the deathless hills that keep
jr^aru ever the California Held. When
Mie struggle wiis over the cheers rose
tu' the Eentiii.
It ill happened in the second balf of
the lootbali game. California had the
ball On h*r own nfiy-yard line. Quar
itrback Whitman ululated u;e signal
in bis own falsetto way. It was Sncd
igar with the pigs>ki:i close in around
\lue blue and gold left end.
iCttrelle put CocjK-r yoi of commis
sion. Head bowled over Dolan. Cali
furnia'a right half -had a clear rield.
AVilliaias, Oregon's left half, who has
made his own ten sceci;d on half a
d'-xen tracks, took up the chase six feel
behind. The other players and officials
composed the tail of this double
headed comet.
Slightly swerving to the right, Sned
s?ar t hot down the field In his pacer
stride. Just out of tackling distance
"Wiliiaihs followed with the speed of a
lice horcre. Where their legs should
have been was a blur. The last chalk
line was coming nearer to Sn'edigar, but
t-o was Williams. "Will he catch him?"
was the thought in every mind. Finally
the Oregon man dove through the air.
He clasped the striped stockings of the
California^ and Snedigar was down.
But the bullet-like blue and gold back
had just crossed the line and it was a
Touchdown â the only one of the day.
Force kicked the goal, which, with a
ftld goal in the Jirst half, completed
the score of ten.
. The boys from the home town of the
Holy Boilers put up a splendid fight.
ThVir coach is "Doc" Steckel. who
bandied Nevada two years ago. when
ihe sabebrushers tied Stanford and de
feated .California. Coach Knibbs sent
in the freshmen backs at first. After
&tÂ»out fifteen minutes of play it seemed i
that the elevens were pretty evenly
matched. Then the varsity back field
entered the lists and the complexion of
the contest changed.
Just before the close of the half Cali
fornia secured the ball on Oregon's
thirty-yard line as a result of a fumble
and Force kicked a field goal. The
home team made several other fruitless
attempts to duplicate' this play during
the remainder of the game. The work
of the four men behind the rush line
was a revelation to everybody and
must have brought fear to the hearts
of a bunch of Stanford football men
-who watched the contest from the
bleachers. The way those backs harn
wered out ga^ns reminded me for all
the world of the -manner Knibbs' alma
sr.ater back used to come through
the hole where I should have "been In the
r>M days cf the new England triangular
league. Th*> point is that California's
backs play like Dartmouth's and that
is and has been for many years top
notch quality.
The line is still weak in spots. Kit
trelle Is improving rapidly at end and
may yet have his portrait hung in the
haii of football fame. From present
Indications California -will send an ex
o-llent eleven into the field a week
from Saturday. Pilkington and Wil
liams played the best game for Oregon
yesterday.

RED MEN PRESS
CARDINAL HARD
LOS ANGELES, Oct. IS.â Stanford 6,
Indians 4/ was the final score of the
gridiron contest at Fiesta. Park this af
ternoon, and if the result of the game
last Saturday on the same field between
Berkeley and the Indians and that of to- \u25a0
day can be taken as a standard of judg- i
ment, the prospects are bright for the j
boys of the State University. While the |
Indians showed more speed, and probably j
used better judgment to-day than they
did against Berkeley, the Stanford play
ers did not develop the aggressiveness of
the Berkeley giants, nor did the Cardinal
line hold as well against the smashing
plays of the heavy Indian team. It was a
better game from a spectacular stand
point than the one last Saturday, be- j
cause it was closer and the final score .
appeared to be in doubt at all times.. \
There was a small crowd in attendance, j
probably not half the number that saw |
the Berkeley team walk uirough the In
dian line last Saturday, and there was
very little enthusiasm, except when one
of the red men showed a brilliant bit of
speed around the Stanford ends or broke
through the line for gains.
Neither side scored In the first half,
which. like the Berkeley game, was cut
to twenty minutes. Frem the start It
was evident that the Indians were in
better form than last Saturday, and the
way they broke through Stanford's line
soon compelled the varsity team to re
sort to kicking. Even at this they lost
ground. The most sensational play of
the first half was the" run of Lugo, the
big Indian right halfback. Breaking
through Stanford's left end, he carried
the ball forty-five yards down the field
before he was downed.
Stanford played desperately in the sec
ond half and gradually worked down the
field to the Indians' goal. Chalmers, Stott
and Thompson were repeatedly sent
through for gains, the latter finally be
ing carried over for a touchdown from
the five-yard line. Crawford kicked goal
and the score was 6 to 0.
Ten minutes remained for play and the
Indians went to.it like wild men. After
an exchange of kicks, the Indians had
the ball on Stanford's forty-yard line,
Lugo was sent around for twenty and
ten yards In succession and with ten
yards to go Tortes kicked a field goal
p.nd the score stood 6 to 4. The game
ended with the ball in the hands of the
Indians on their ten-yard line. ..

BERKELEY LADS
ROUT OAKLAND
The football team from the Berkeley
High School yesterday afternoon . de
feated the Oakland High School team
by the dt-cislve score of 20-0, making
its average for the last ten years
nine wins, eight of which were con
secutive, and placing the team In the
finals for the championship of the State
of California,
The Oakland team was no match for
the supporters of the red and yellow,
the Berkeley boys going through their
line 'and around their ends seemingly
at will. Every play that was run oft
by the winning team went like clock
work, nnd their victory was won solely
on merit.
The first half^ was the only time
during Â£ the cohtest* that the' Oakland
boys played jn any kind- of form, hold
ing the-ir-oj'ponviits .down to one place
kick. " ; ; ' . - â¢- - \u25a0; "
Harris of Oakland then.' ..kicked ;Oft

Berkeley then bucked to their forty-*
yard Hnt. but were set back, for off
side play. To regain territory a fake
kick was tried. Maihews making twen
ty yards by the trick..; Fifteen more
were nÂ«>xt gained on ;i quarterback
sneak. During- the entire game this
play was successfully used by both
teams, and rartly less than two yards
were gained. However,v this "sneak"
didn't :?o, for Main penalized the Berke
ley team because its quarterback l'alleil
to run out live yards before cutting
in. Berkeley was forced to kick, and j
the half ended with the ball on Oak- !
land's twenty-yard line.
In the second half the Oakland men
seemed to weaken. ; iust as they did
last year in the flnals^with Uck. Sol^
insky of Berkeley kicked off. The bait
went- right through an Oakland man's
hands and bounded high in the air,
only to be "copped" on Us descent by
Merritt, who toolkit, on the run. He
made straight for this- goal line with
out being, molested.

WEST POINT. Xe'w^Yo'rfc.. OcC.2S.-4rt
Yale's Â» football team defeated West
Point .; to-day by the score of 20 to 0.
making three touchdowns . and ...one
safety. "Yale's large^ score .was made
during sudden spurts, in which " the
heavy eleven- threw" JVest Point's de
fense aside with apparent ease and
crossed the pridiron for touchdowns in
a few mass plays.
Aside from these few minutes' play
the game looked quite promising for
West Point. Toward the close of the
game Yaje's attack strengthened and
sensational runs were continually
made. The game was practically ended
before the time limit by hundreds of
enthusiasts running upon the field
after Yale's last touchdown had been
made on a 45-yard run by Quarterback
Jones.
Both elevens used mass play;; entirely.
Frequently a group of - four or five
Yale players broke through West
Point's defense and started an excit
ing obstacle race toward the army's
goal for gains of five and twenty yards.
At such times the soldier tackles werer
dragged along the ground by* the Yale
mass and stopped its progress -only by
throwing themselves on the ground to
be trampled on. V .

were held last night.
For the first time in many years the
bset players have been placed farther be
hind scratch than 30. " Several of the ex
perts will be called upon to owe odds of
30 3-6. The limit men will receive 30, and
if one of them does not carry off thÂ»,hon
ors it will be no fault of tÂ£e committee
that did the, handicapping; The â¢ poorer
players have been given bigger odds than
ever before and ;the experts will have a
harder time .than,. usual, carrying off the
honors. .. This .'. system , of handicapping is
somewhat in the nature of an experiment
and will be changed If the results are not

TALENT HAS A GOOD
LINE OK THE HOUNDS
Blanche Jewett Creates a
>M\& Surprise by Beating
The Mist.
The hares at Ingleslde coursing park
yesterday were a fleet lot and many of
them made the escapes" before the grey
hounds got a turn. But two rounds
of the open stake were run. It .will be
finished to-day. -with three other events.
The talent had "a good line on the dogs,
as nearly every course was won on Its
merit. The Mist, which was figured to
have a good chance for the money, lost
to Blanche Jewett In the first round.
The deciding course of the Cham
pion Etake. which was left .unfinished
from last Sunday, should prove a great
race to-day -when Sampler and Orslna
meet. Orsina has been showing a great
burst of speed and has been lending the
best of them to the hare of late. Ths

The Giants decided to wade in and
break up their losing streak yesterday
afternoon, and, although Uncle Hank
sent in Jimmy Whalen to work. It did
not seem to bother the stars from Port- j
land at all. For six innings they did â¢
nothing but field like big leaguers. J
After that time they turned their at- I
; tention to walloping the- leather and
i in the seventh and ninth they gathered
I four runs, which was plenty.
i In the meantime Cy Ferry was pitch
ing. ball that would beat most any
team. The Seals could hardly get a
foul off him and when they^ did line
the leather down the grassy way some
I agile fielder was always there to grab
It. In fact San Francisco did not figure
at all till the last round of play, when
they managed to slug Ferry for a run,
but fell down with three men still .on.
tne bases.
Mohler opened up the ninth for
Uncle with a slashing double against
the far right field fence. Hfldebrand
died easy, but Nealon clouted one to
the Scoreboard for two sack* and Moh
ler arrived with the only run. Irwin
and Gochnauer walked and "Wheeler
was called to stick In place of Wilson,
but he could do no better than line
an easy one to Atz.
Van Buren started It off for the
v.ants in the seventh by rapping out a
single to left. Mitchell laid one down
and Xealon dropped Whalen's throw.
Schlafley sacrificed both along and Mc-
Lean sent them home with a hit past
short: He was Â»orced at second by ilc-
Hale,' who advanced on a balk and
crossed the plate as Sweeney ripped
one to left.
The Giants added one more in the
ninth on Schlafley*s double and Sween
ey's second hit. They fielded without
an error and all the lnflelders were
kept busy picking up the hot ones and
throwing them over to first, Atz
played a grand game, as did Schlafley
and McHale. TÂ«e latter had six
chances out In center field. * The score:

The overdue British ship Forteviot,
which was quoted for reinsurance at
16 per cent, arrived yesterday after
noon, one of a large fleet of sailing
vessels which rn:ide port all in a
bunch. The Forteviot brings a cargo
of general merchandise from England.
She was 15S days from Newcastle.
Among the wind jammers whose ar
rivals kept quarantine and Custom
house ofiicials busy until after sunset
were two French barks, both from the
old world. The Emma Laureant ar
rived from HuJL and from Swansea
came La Rocheja.quilein.
The safe arrival of the Forteviot cuts
down the number of vessels on the

LoarÂ« Satchel at Ferry Depot.
'While William Hawkins of Cleve
land, Ohio, was buying a railroad ticket
Tor home at the ferry depot yesterday,
a thief walked away with the satchel
Hawkins had laid at his feet. When
he missed the satchel Hawkins turned
around to seek .a policeman and found,
almost at his elbow, more men In blue
than hÂ» could have summoned with a
riot call. And they had all been right
tbÂ«rÂ« when the satchel thief performed
the ceremony of annexation. Stand-
Ing bo close to Hawkins that their
shadows marked the spot where the
satchel had rested were Police Ser
reant "Scotty" Campbell, Detective
Egan and Policemen Thompson, High
tower and O'Keefe. The police have
no clew either to the missing property
or tbe man who stole It. but after long
discussion they came to the conclusion
that a satchel thief was operating at
the ferry depot.

STRAY GOSSIP
OF THE TURF
Bob Lloyd," the Popular New
York Layer of Prices,
Quietly Drops Int o Town
PHIL HAMILL' IS BACK
C. Morris, a Crack Latonia
! Jockey, AVill; Come "Here
"With the ' Arthur Stable
BY FRED E. MUL.HOLLAND.
Almost every overland brings a fresn
addition to the turf forces collectintr, here
for the coming race meeting. Bob Lloyd,"
the New, York layer who booked at Oak
land ; last season, arrived :on Friday", in
time to see Jack O'Brien \u25a0 \u25a0 lower -the col
ors of Al Kaufmanh at Woodward's Pa
vilion. "Bob had a 'fairly good, season in
the East.
Phil Hamill, who for, several; seasons
was connected with Barney Schrleber's
booking enterprises, reached here 'from
Latonia yesterday. Phil says: Jack At-,
klna cleaned up about $12,000 laying prices
at 'the Kentucky track, and is now on
his way back to California:
The California penciler, Jim Davis, who
has attached himself to the Corrigan out
fit, was at one time about $14,000 to the
good on the Latonia and Louisville meet-
Ings. â¢ . Then followed some '. reverses,
sweeping away most of his winnings.
From hearsay Barney j Schrelber has a
superb bunch of yearlings this . year.
They were for the most part . the get' of
Bannockburn and Sir Hercules. Foul
Shot is dead and Barney appears to have
temporarily soured on Sain.. The big St.
Louis' breeder and bookmaker will cut in
at Oakland the first or second week.
Billy Beverley, who booked out this
way and made, money when a five
pound grocery store weight would keep
his bank roll on an even keel, had a
big season on the New York tracks.
Beverley has outgrown the Far West.
C. Steubenboard Jr., owner of Father
Catchem, Elle, J T F and other useful
ones, has sent on a batch of entries to
the California Jockey Club stakes.
Steubenboard was much pleased with
his treatment at Oakland a season ago.
J. W. Brooks, manager of Ascot
Park, is a merchant now as well as a
"turfman. He, recently embarked in the
tobacco business at Los Angeles with
Bert Mooser.
â¢ Henry Hoffman, the St. Louis book
maker, is already in California, and his
brother Paul will arrive In time tocut
In the first day at Oakland; The Hoff
man boys are very popular in this sec
tion of the country.- and seldom refuse
any bets tendered.
C. Morris, considered by many the
best of the Latonia riders, ; will be here
with the stable of Jim Arthur. The
latter recently wired for stalls at
Oakland.
Some^ldea of the magnitude with
which the bookmaking business Is con
ducted on the far Eastern . tracks can
be gleaned if torn the statement made
by a recently returned player. One big
day at Saratoga Billy Cowen handled
$154,000 on the six races, of which
sum $72,000 remained in his takebox.
That would be considered rather a fair
afternoon's '\ winning on a California
course. \u25a0
Bob McGibben thinks Sysonby | over
rated. He says Morello In his day would
send the Keene crack -back; back to
Hackensack. Morello has long "since de
parted to the horse heaven, It might be
added. ' "
If Ananias broke down, as reported on
his " last essay at New York, Johnny
Schorr assuredly Is playing In hard luck.
James Hanby, or "Busy Jimmy," as he
Is more 'familiarly known, will give Cali
fornia the go-by this winter. It is re
ported. Jimmy has something better in
sight at New Orleans.
"Curly" â¢ Brown, the starter, is the pro
prietor of the swellest care in Cincinnati.
A portion of : the Interior is now being
converted Into a vaudeville theater, to
be conducted under the popular price sys
tem. S^rA \u25a0 '
Sacramento is the latest to be heard
from. The horses owned by Al Dobson,
J; Touhey and Ed . Krlpp . reached Oak
land from up country; yesterday.
Gregor K. and the balance of the horses
which race in the/colors of J. Korzeniew
ckl, were due at Oakland last night.
Gregor X will bear watching this winter.
COMMITTEE OF CREDITORS
HAS CHARGE OF PROPERTY
Attachment la Filed Agralnai , the F.
Cavagnaro Company, but IÂ» Re
, \u25a0 leased by Clalmboldera.
An- attachment was placed' on the
property of the F. Cavagnaro Company,
yesterday, by J. Fugazl for J5OOO,
money ' loaned,, but this was released
soon' afterward. The' other creditors
of the company promised to proceed to
throw the company Into bankruptcy
unless the7*attaching creditor receded.
' All .the. property of the company Is
now In' the hands of a committee of
three, representing all the creditors.
They are F. H. Hilbert ot-Hilbeft Bros.,
A. L. Dowler of Clark Bros. & Co; and
F. S. Jacott of the Swiss-American
Bank.
The taking of stock for the purpose
of ascertaining the value of â¢ goods on

Probably the real extent of the dif
ference; between the liabilities and
assets will not be definitely known be
fore the middle of the. present week.
The amount is probably about $40,000.

* orousf-life and the spirit of energy show itself in every move of your body. I have told. you that Elec-
tricity is "Life." and now all scientists and doctors are approving my claim. Let me. prove it to you; let
me show you how my method of applying this great power has revolutionized medical treatment.
The human body is a very delicate piece of machinery. It must be treated gently and intelligently
when it is beginning to break down. Dosing the sensitive stomach with drugs will not restore strength.
Even if the drugs had strength to give, they never reach the parts that need the strength. The greatest
scientists' and doctÂ«r,s now acknowledge that Electricity is the basis of vitality. Therefore'use it, but use
it right. - This is mv specialty. I know better than : any otjier man on earth how to use it in these special
troubles, because I have had the benefit of twenty-four years of close study and actual contact with over
50,000 cases treated with it.

circulation and makes you feel bright, active and vigorous in one night's use. Yon get stronger each day.
and in a few weeks you are a new man â stronger and. younger in the fire of youth. It is grand, this
method of mine, and every man who has ever used it is _ praising it.

this wan the MOST AMAZING OF ALL. It
reminded me of WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY.
Kexradio is the MARCONI of modern heal-
ers. Take a DEAF person to him and "you"
can WITNESS him REPEAT this MARVEL.
Recently I saw him make a DEAF MUTB
(in 3 seconds) both HEAR and SPEAK. In
my opinion NO person need REMAIN DEAF
with such a marveloua power at hand. The
came day I SAW a nearly HELPLESS PAR-
ALYTIC instantly enabled to RAISE his ieg
* feet high; also RUN and JUMP. No, mat-
ter who "doubts" or "denies" these things,
they are TRUE and I am ready to co state
OX OATH. \u25a0 I will give you NAMES and
ADDRESSES of many I have SEEN him
(successfully treat for alleged "incurable"
PARALYSIS. LUMBAGO. SCIATICA.
GOITRE, total DEAFNESS, LOCOMOTOR
ATAXIA, DEAF-MUTEISM, etc. in "each"
case the great benefits being INSTANTA-
NEOUS. Personally I had severe and often
disabling RHEUMATISM off and on over 20
years, making me BEDFAST weeks at a
time. I spent THOUSANDS of dollars vain-
ly seeking a cure. Rexradio thoroughly
CURED me by ONE treatment and I ItB-
MAIN perfectly well after EIGHTY-EIGHT
DAYS. You caa WRITE or SEE me, â C.

years owner und editor of CAL. JOURNAL.
has for 40 years been a prominent citizen.)
"LOCOMOTOR ATAXIA" had made me
nearly HELPLESS, when by ONE brief
treatment I was able to move my, till then.
IMMOVABLE arm, RAISE my nearly POW-
ERLESS leg "4 feet" high and LEAP off
the floor on October 7. and I am continually
improving to data, I SAW the 2 cases as
above reported by Mr. Engleke. Words are
too poor to describe the almost "Incredible"
wonders I caw performed, and I can give
you "names" and addresses of the patients.

FAIR WRITER
WINS A PRIZE
Special Dispatch to The Call.
i LONDON, Oct. 2S.â To a London woman
has fallen the prize of $500 offered a year
ago by T. Fisher Unwin, the Engli3h
publisher, for the hest "first novel" sub
mitted to him. The' lucky wrlteY. is Mrs.
Balllie-Saunders,' who is the wife of a
clergyman in the Marylebone district, and
the novel which won the competition,
and which is to see the light shortly, is
called "Saints in Society."
The object of this competition was to
discover unknown story-tellers, and only
those were eligible who never had had
a novel published. The result was a
deluge. Manuscripts poured in \u25a0 from the
four corners of the earth, completely
swamping Unwin's professional reader-
Inside of six months this long-suffering
individual read something like 30,000,000
words, .which, he , calculates, is equiva
lent to twelve and three-quarter miles
of typewritten pages, measured "length
wise. Of these manuscripts about five
per cent were- "publishabie." From the
names appended it would appear that the
sexes were fairly evenly balanced among
the competitors, but it is suspected that
many feminine contestants elected to use
masculine appellations, so the fair aspir
ants were probably in a majority.
In the winner. Mrs. Baillie-Saunders,
Fisher Unwin believes he has discovered
a new novelist of unusual promise. Be
fore her marriage she was a newspaper
woman, and although "Saints in Society"
is her first novel, a monograph of hers
on Dickens and a small volume on Mary
lebone celebrities have already been pub
lished.
"1 wrote 'Saints in Society* last winter
in about two months," she said, in taking
about the matter. "I was very busy with
other things at" the time, but I felt com
pelled to write that book. The charac
ters in itâ by the way. they do -not exist
in real lifeâ quite haunted me. They
seemed, as it were, to .be constantly at
my door. So mainly, I think, "in order to
get rid of them 1 wrote the book. They
have gone now, and |I miss them much,
as one misses a troublesome tooth that
has been extracted."
The principal characters in the prize
novel are Mark Hading and his wife.
The former begins life as a small printer
and a Christian socialist. He rtees-to
'wealth, power and title, and a flattering
'world robs hlrri of his former sincerity
of purpose. His wife, on the other hand,
grows in nobility of character as they
grow in riches. .The novel, in fact, illus
trates the contrasting Influences" . which
wealth exercises over different tempÂ«ra-
Ttients. â¢
In his "There and Back." -the late Dr.
George Macdonald wrote this dedication:
"In the sure hope of everlasting brother
hood I offer this book to Ronald Mac
donald, my son and friend, my pupil, fel
low-student and fellow- workman."
The Ronald Macdonald here referred
to gives promise of continuing honorably
the traditions of his name. His novel,
"The Sword of the King." had a consider
able success in England and America,
and the play of the same name, drama
tized by the author from his own novel,
went well in Americar although it had
trouble here.' Just before his father's
death Ronald Macdonald a
novel to be called "The Seamaid," which
is to be i>ubli?hed on both sides of the
ocean in January. The author was for
a time a schoolmaster In . the .United
States and knows and loves the country
;well. He has-been much interested in the
dramatic possibilities of Anna Katherlne
Green's "Millionaire Baby," and the re
sult may be a play based. on that story
of* mystery.-;
Jules /Verne's reputation as a prophetâ
already greater than that of. any modern
writerâ has been increased by the recent
happenings â¢in ' the Caucasus. Practically
everything that has - occurred in that
troubled- part of the Czar's domain -Is
anticipated in the pages of "Michael
Strogoff.*: Yet the probability of the in
cidents In exciting novel was severe
ly questioned^ by the French playwright
D'Ennerj* when '-Verne brought It to him
to be dramatized. "
"My friend," D'Ennery reported, "your
story is very interesting, "but I can do
nothing with It for , the theater. Its im
probabilities are such as the public, would
not accept.'.; l draw^ your attention to one
improbability i in; particular, .the burning
of , the. petroleum l reservoirs. . Do. you see
this ; river. -"of j fire,'- rolling its waves or
flame for miles? J I do not j 'deny .that it
would have been a fine spectacular effect.
But it is too Jmprobable." It is more
than Improbable.-: It; is': lmpossible.'*,.
vj '.'lmprobable." perhaps." Jules Verne re
plied, "but impossible? - No. In the coming

ASTOR ALLOWED
SEVERAL VOTES
Former American Has Big
ger Voice in British Politics
Than He Had Over Here
HE MAKES USE OF ALL
His Large Building on the
Thames Counted as a Home
Despite Official Protest
Special Dispatch to The CalL
LONDOX. Oct. 28.â When WUliam
Waldorf Astor became a naturalized
Britfsh subject he lost his right to vota
In America, of course, but as compen
sation he gulned seveial votes in Enj
land. That Is because here tho exer
cise of thÂ« suffrage Is made dependent
on property rtualiflcatlons. and a man
who possesses residences in different
parts of the country gets a vote for
each one of them, subject to compliance
with certain conditions. Astor ha..* -
proved himself a good British citizen
to the ertent. at least, of claiming all
the votes he is entitled to. He has re
cently successfully upheld his right to
vote on account of the Astor estate of
fice, the Beautiful castle of commerc.
which he has built on the Thames em
bankment.
Astor is a Conservative, the- party
which, above all others, stands for vest
ed interests and the sacred rights of
property. The Liberals favor the prin
ciple of one vote for each man. It was
a Liberal agent who sought to reduce
Aster's votes by depriving him of the
one which stood to the credit of his
estate office. He contended that It
would not be correctly described as one
of Astor's places of abode, since he had
ascertained by Inquiry that Aator never
slept there. Bat the Conservative agent
won a triumph for the great landlord
by producing a letter from his private
secretary, which: read: *"v^' Â»
"Mr.- Astor's place of 'abode la cor
rectly described In the overseer's list.
It is true that. Mr. Astor has a house
in Carlton" House Terrace, but except
for two or three nights in. the- year he
resides at. this otQce when he Is lv.
London." â¢ \u25a0 â¢ \u25a0
The building was designed by , th<Â»
architect of Trurd Cathedral', and It- la '
a model of grace, beauty and strength.'.
It is believed' to.be thestrongjest tioJM

During the period when tha outflow of money
from thia center to tha West was greater than
two and three weeks ago speculative holdings
were heavily liquidated and money rate* ad
vanced . sharply to 6 per cent. .
Tha stock market became the center of bear
attacks and every endeavor was made to reach
vulnerable points in the eecurlty list by those
who' are always ready to unsettle values.

market from theee attacks and prevent demor

There were too many buyers yesterday, how

nervous on' the foreign political.o utlook and
the strike at Fall River.- The latter interests
expected to have a- meeting â¢on \u25a0 Monday, but
frcm a business standpoint - the mills believe
the strike will be avoided. Liverpool; cables
explain their weakness by offerings of spot

Future Grain and ; Provisions.
CHICAGO, Oct. 2S.â Strength was manifest
ed in the wheat market throughout the entire
session. At the : opening the May option was
up J A@%c to y>Â®%c at ai%c Jto Â»l%c. De
cember was up Me to %c at SOVic to 89% c.
Continuance ot disturbances in Russia formed
almost the only tactor that . had any impor
tant bearing on -the market situation. : Reports
regarding conditions In tha Czar's domain were
conflicting, but the Impression prevailed gen
erally that the worst was j-et to come. v< During
the last half hour bull sentiment was partly
held In check by an estimate from a British
statistician regarding world's shipments for
the wÂ£ek. The estimate placed the total ship
ments at over 12,500,000 bushels. This total,
if confirmed, would seem ro indicate, In â¢ spite
or disorders <in Russia, shipments from the
country, were still in progress. Another fact
that gave some encouragement to bears was
the clear weather In the Northwest. Mean
time prices receded a trifle. May selling off to
91c and September to 89% c. Later the mar
ket received fresh buying Impetus through a
cablegram from. London claiming that the
Odessa Bourse, \u25a0 owing to the strike situation,
had declared an emergency cancellation -of all
gram contracts. Influenced by this Informa
tion shorts covered freely, forcing the price of
the May option up to 92% c and December to
JKfftc. Realizing sales caused some reaction,
but the market closed strong, with May %@%c
up at.9l?4c. December closed' IVic higher at
OOVic >
The feature of trading In the corn market
was heavy purchases of the May option by a
leading bull. The market closed nrm, with
December *jc higher at 45% c. May sold be
tween 45VaC and 40%@4Â« 1 / Ac and closed at
4GV4e. -
While trading In oats was less spirited than
of late, the market was strong throughout.
December closed up %c at 30% c.

lots are celling f . o. b."- for shipment East at

CRUSADE SHOWS
GOOD RESULTS
Milk Supplied to City Is
Improved Since Health
Board Was Forced to Act
CHEMIST FILES KEPOKT
Only Complaint Gibbs Makes
Thus Far Is Lack of But
ter Fat in Two Instances
City Chemist Gibbs filed a report of his
aoialj s-is of fifty-four samples of milk yes
terday with the Health Eosxd. The pub
llcliy given to the practice of unprinci
pled dealers putting adulterant* in their
yniiu- has had some effect In providing 'a
purer milk supply at least for a time.
Out of the fifty-four samples chemically
\u25a0inalyzed oiJly one was below the stand
ard of 5.2 i>er cent of butter fat for this
season! This sample was taken from the
dairy <>f S. W. Payne of Sausalito. whose
milk Bhwed but o per cent of butter fat.
Pa>nt's milk will be barred from sale in
this caarket unless Jt shows ud better in
future-, analyses.
Xcn? of the samples showed the pres
ence of anj- formaldehyde, coal tar dye
or other roisonous substance. A sample
frcm the Guadaloux>e dair>'. owned by
D. O. Crook, and submitted by* Supervisor
Payot of 522 Ellis street, showed 3.2 per
cent of butter fau \u25a0which is Just the
limit nor.- allowed by law. A sample or
milk supp'ied by the Mountain View
Creamery to Klsa Brothers of 31 Duboce
â¢venue Also showed 3.2 per cent butter
*at. Health Officer Ragan ordered no
tices tetu io the two latter dairies notify
ing them to be careful not to let the but
er fat fall below the percentage named.
Bacteriologist Car.ney did not tile his re
port on the samples relative to disease
gerrr.s or pus. but will do so next week.
Of cottrfe it is expected that all samples
taken now wlil Dass the test in view of
the agitation against impure milk now
being carried on. When the vigilance of
the health offlcials relaxes it will be well
for consumers to watch their milk supply
Â«.Tid have samples analyzed by private
chemists or tbe chemist of the Health
Board.
Health Officer Regan yesterday issued
tJ*e following statement relative to the
power of the Health Board to order ar
rests for violations of the milk ordinance:
Th* health officials having b*en subjected
to *ome criticism In the dailr press with re
eari to th* errest of milk dealers, samples of
â¢whose product have been left at *he olflce by
the purchaser, instead of being taken by the
Inspector* !n the regular way. the Health
OTflcer. Pr. I). F. Ragan. consulted with the
District Attorney, his legal adriser. as to the
course that *houM b* pursued in eases of this
character. Dr. Ttag-an was advised, that the
only !e*a! method to pursue in making ar
re*tf= Â«v to conform etrictjy to the ordinance
covering these i-a.se?. which plainly states the
' rriMhol by whirh samples may be procured.
If the health authorities arrested and attempt
ed to prosecute any offender whose product
was found to be below standard or adulterated,
rh>- sample* being Wt at the office by In
dividuals then they, the heaJth offlcials. would
ley themselv* liable to suit for damages.

Ministerial majority, and the embarrass

already in general disorder in the po-~

Paris and the provinces.
M. Javrcs. the great- and brilliant

make a new departure. This consists in
putting forward in many of the con

unable to vote for them. The effect of
this decision upon Parliamentary

Broadcloth $1.00
It's 52 inches wide. It's the queen
of all $1.00 broadcloths because the
price is humbled. It's a cloth that
was made to sell at $1.25 yard. Nice,
soft, velvety finish. And when we
buy again we will have to sell it for
$1.25, maybe more, for there is a
broadcloth famine now.
Big suit makers in the East have
been forced to buy, from retail stocks
to fill their orders. They would be
glad to share this cloth at $1.00 yard,
52 inches wide, in all shades.
$1.00 Cheviot at 75c:
50 inches wide, all wool, sponged and

Largely increased stocks,
greater conveniences â already
the holiday atmosphere is fill-
ing the air.
'Thanksgiving
Next month â next month starts
Wednesday.
Linens, dishes, silverware. The
store is ready to help you to-
morrow.
CHRISTMAS
Is coming.
"Christmas is here." Bring the
little girls to see the dolls on the
third floor; how many there are,
how pretty. The values are the
best we have ever had.
Doll furniture out this week-
Some in a window to-day.
Most to choose from now.
Shopping is less crowded.
That is why so many have be-
gun holiday shopping already, to
get the most strenuous part of the
buying over with. Later the en-
thusiasm of the merry throngs of
shoppers every bne enjoys. Yes,
the store is to be more than ever
San Francisco's most important
shopping center this year.
Come and see why to-morrow.
Look straight up through the
central court. The Market-Â«treet
building is two stories taller.
See how strongly and quickly
the new Sixth-street annex, six
stories tall, is being joined to the
present store.
Of course building operations â
hammering, noise, dust â are up-
setting certain sections somewhat.
A tearing-down has to be be-
fore a greater building up, and
we're thinking of the greater store,
the greater convenience to come.
Meantime we're trying to keep
services and conditions as near the
Hale standard of satisfactoriness
as possible.
In a great many cases
â¢Prices Greatly Lowered
Are in force to establish shopping
equilibrium. Several departments
have already moved into larger,'
better quarters.
Notably: Notions (to the do-
mestic aisle); house helps (room
doubled downstairs); crockery
(moving downstairs).
Visit the store to-morrow.
Come, if just to see how the same
broad policy that made this busi-
ness best, then biggest, is operat-
ing now to make it bigger yet;
and in the transitional period.
Now, making shopping induce-
ments so unusually attractive and
important that this news covers
but a portion of the advantages
the store, holds for to-morrow's
