Popular Woman Educator of
Los Angeles School Caught
in a Trap by Detective
Bpeclil Dlspttch to The Call.
LOS AXGEIes, June 80â Th^ myÂ»
terjr BurroantUae \u25a0series of annoying
tbeftH nhlcb has contlnaed since Feb
ruary and during: which time more
than SICO has bwÂ« stolen from tencli
Â«â¢''"â¢ \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 Â«>â¢*Â«Â» â¢olved and to the amaze
ment of those Interested It has been
established that ftlsa Isolde Butler, one
of the beat known of the female city,
teachers, Is the Ulef. She has con
fessed her ffulli.
\ Miss Butler haÂ« esered to make res-
Stltution and there will be no prosecu
'.tion. Now that the school year Is at
> an end her name will be dropped from
ijihe rolls and she has promised to go
Â«away to some place inhere she Is not
H known. ' \
The detecUon of MlsÂ» Butler as a
V thief is a sequel to a scandal In which
; Â«he was Implicated nearly a year ago
Certain letters reflecUng seriously
upon the fhtegrlty of the school board
members were circulated. \ They bore
what appeared to be the signature of
Miss Reavls, another^ teacher.. and Miss
Butler received most of thÂ»m. Miss
Ueavis denied \u25a0 having writtÂ«ii them
and employed a handwriting \ expert
who declared that Miss Butler herself
had written the letters. At,- the final
trial nothing came of the matter and
Miss Butler was transferred to the
Fremont-avenue school.
i Saoii thereafter teachers at that
school befc-an missing money, stickpins,
small articles of jewelry and other
valuables. This prpperty was taken
from desks and from cloak rooms at
euch hours that it was impossible to
charge the school children with the
thefts. For several weeks the teachers
kept watch, but without result. Final
ly they employed a private detectlvo
and he set a trap for the thief by leaV-
Jiig a well-filled purse where it could
be watched The purse was stolen by
Miss Butler and when she. caught In
the act, was confronted with the-evi
dence, the . broke "down ' and confessed
that she had committed all the thefts,
phe declared that one had a mania for
stealing: and coulA not control herself

In tjie death of John Hay, America
loses one of the greatest statesmen of
Â« II Hie uses. Kor seven years he domi- (
natcd the diplomacy of the' nation and :
in those yours America has crown from |
an Isoliitcd republic to a great world
power. His iniluenoe was = always;
Â«xerted for good. While caring for the
interests of Auicrira. lie' was. \!gilaut
for the cause of huaianity; His voice j
ppoke for tlie oppressed In Routnanla j
fls it did for the outraged American
In Morocco. He gave to the world a
new diplomacy, the- diplomacy* of un
erring integrity..
Hay was guided by a simple standard.
When askÂ»d by a 'friend for the key to
his profound statesmanship, he replied: j
â¢"I ask only for what is right, and then
insist.tiron gcttins it." c , ' j
Jcnn Hay ha# J#Â»ft an indelible mark j
on hfs country's hietory. From the time I
wlien as a boy U* went up to Washhig-^
ton to become tlie private secretary of j
Pre.sj<3er.t Lincoln, more than forty I
years ago. to the present he figured j
conspicuously in the affairs of thÂ« na- !
tion. I
He will be best remembered for his]
policy tou-ard China, hie insistence
upon the open door and the political en
tity of the empire.
He brought about the peaceable adjust
ment cf the Alaskan boundary question,
and negotiated with Panama and Colom
bia for the canal.
It was the same Ftern honesty, uncloud
ed wisdom and sweetness of nature that
endeared him t<s the leaders of the re
public from Lincoln to Roosevelt. He as

Distance of Three 3liles
- TOLEDO, June 30.â One of the moat re
markable flights ever made in an air
ship was" accomplished to-day by A.* B Â«
Kr.abenahue, the California aeronaut,
= who sailed through the air for a dis
tance of three miles, landed on top of a
ten-storx office building in twenty-five
* minutes , from the time of starting, and
then returned to the spot. fr6m which he
slarted. , , - â¢,*
3 Th<Â» day was Ideal for the daring feat
A light win*J was blowing from the east
and Knabenahue sailed his aerial* craft
directly In the face of the breeze. Be
fore starting he indicated the building on
wh!eh he would alight. When he left
the starting: place, he directed the ship
straight for the city. When half the dis
tance had tvpen cov^tsKi an upper current
of air carried him U9 to a distance of 300OÂ»
feet. The nervy aeronaut; did. not lose
control of his machine for a moment and
steerej.it directly for the heart of th&
city. Business was entirely suspended
â¢and the entire population gathered in the
streets to watch the course of the ship.
When, directly over the skyscraper Kca
benshue directed his craft downward aijd
alighted on the building with the ease
and grace of. a bird.
A round of applause greeted the daring'
navigator who was less excited than any
of the spectators. After examining the
ship and receiving the congratulations of
his friends, Knabenshue started 6n his
trip back â¢ and going with the wind he
made the return voyage in fifteen min
utes. He declares. that his present ship
ia far superior to others he has navi
gated, that It la easier manned and that
he has solved the problem of aerial navi
gation. ;

ST. PETERSBURG, June
30. 10:10 p. in.â Martial-law
has been .proclaimed in the
Governments of Sebastopol,
Xichblaieff and Erivan. An
im])eriai decree 'confers on
the Viceroy of the Caucasus
the rights of a military com
mander with special powers.
The same powers are bestow
ed on the commander of the
Black Sea fleet, so far as the
districts of Sebastopol and
Xicholaieff are concerned.
ODESSA, June 30 (evening).
This rauch-dreaded day, to the
surprise of every one, passed with
out a shot being fired either ashore
cr afloat, while the mutinous crew
cf the battleship Kniaz Potemkine
capitulated unconditionally to
Vice Admiral Kruger's squad
rtn, and at 5 130 o'clock this after
noon the vessel was slowly steam
ing three miles distant after Ad
mral Krugers vessels, which had
already sailed and were visible six
tries away.
Exactly what happened during
t is day of dramatic surprises is,
1j a great extent, a matter of
vV .njecture, aided by binoculars.
After the shots the Kniaz Po
tenkine Fred before midnight on
Tlursday nothing further hap
Â°peied. Odessa awoke early to
da* to find the Black Sea squad
ro i lying off longeron Point, and
every one was expecting a naval
fig t. The city was like an armed
catip.
Iroops barred all the ap
proxhes to the harbor and were
biviuacking in tents in Cathedral
Sqtare, and four batteries of ar
tilljy, well supplied with ammu
nition, had been placed in the park
and at I-angeron.

I|e populace, astir at dawn,

TROUBLE SPREADING
THR 0 UGHOUt RUSSIA
Martial Law Is Declared at Sebastopol ,
Nicholaiejf and Other Cities.
Revolutionists Are Charged With Inciting
y Mutiny on the* Battleship.
ST. PETERSBURG, July 1, 3 a. m.â The first news from Odessa of the sur
render of the Kniaz Potemkine to Vice Admiral Kruger's squadron reached
here through a press dispatch from Washington conveying the tent of a.cable
gram gent by the American Consul at Odessa, W.S. Heenan, as with thedeclar- "
ation of martial law. General Kallanoff had shut down on all dispatches.; Even
the foreign embassies here were without advices during the day. The press,
dispatch announcing the surrender of the battleship was held up until 2 o'clock .
this morning. At the Ministry, of \u25a0 the Interior. the press had been \u25a0 informed yes-:.
t terday afternoon that the Kniaz Potemkine r with a, mutinous ; crew, probably
' drunk, and without'a man on board capable of navigating the ship, had .al
ready weighed anchor and started seaward. The presumption Is; that the bat
tleship met the squadcon before the latter reached the oflllng, and under the ,'
frowning ' guns of Kruger's warships concluded that it was better to surrender
than to fight. ' V-5-V"
I^fARTIAL-LAW DECLARED AT SEBASTOPOL. â¢'\u25a0 m
Reports received by the Ministry of the Interior give an. entirely^ different
version of the origin of the mutiny, which is attributed to a deliberate plot. or- â¢
ganlzed by twenty saflors belonging to the revolutionary, organization. 'These
reports placethe number of killed during the rioting on. shore at J 300 and the
wounded at twice, that number.
M.irtlal law has been declared at Sebastopol and, Nicholaieff. and'extra
ordinary powers have been given to Admiral Chuk'nin,:' commander of the Black .
; â¢ Bea fleet,but beyond, the general conditions existing in Jhese ports of; the Black :
Sea little definite reasons for the declaration of martlallaw are known. Gossip,'
however, says there has been, a. mutiny on board the battleship I; Tohesme. at-
Sebastopol. The declaration of martial law in Erivan was inevitable: ln 'coase
quence of the situation in the Southern Caucasus, dispa'lohes. indicating that
Moslems and Armenians were waging what almost might bi?= called .war.
With the surrender of the Kniaz Potemkine, however, the immediate ', danger
of the situation seemed to collapse, the five thousand blueJackets;at;LJbau; , who
followed the example of their comrades on the. rebel battleship,-' having earlier '?lrijÂ«
the day yielded to the military, by whom they wore surrounded -In a wood \ near,
the spot," after a promise that better foood would be givth them. s
LONGSHOBEMEN JOlfN THE STBIJCEBS.
What seemed like an extension of -.the mutiny, to the Bailors^at Cronstadt.also .
proved to be short lived, although allthe regular workmen' ln the port are still
on strike and reports of 'coming trouble, both there; and at . St.* Petersburg. * are *
rife. The strike to-day was extended to the longshoremen of St. Petersburg and,
the workmen In several large factories are again \u25a0 restive and are 'threatening
disorder. . . \u25a0/\u25a0' \u0084 * '
Late last night a rumor gained currrency that a mob -had sacked a 'small;,
arms factory at Kolplno, twenty miles away, and /was' marching "on St. Peters
burg, but of this rumor no confirmation has been obtained.- . -'"
Now that the Kniaz Potemkine has surrendered; it is probable that, the, Gov
ernment will gradually allow the publication Â«of the details of- the [ mutiny. .The
censorship this morning merely permitted the newspapers : to ' print ra^'dlspatch V
which reads: â¢ . - .\u25a0 \u0084 -'.-.'
"ODESSA, June 17 (old style).â The tranquillity of the city having been . in- : \u25a0:

With the letter the following â¢ statement
was given out: * - â¢ - -.'
' John D. â¢ Rockefeller Jr.. with other gentle
men of this city, was Instrumental In forming
the - General Education Board in February.
ltM/a.' A - very \u25a0 broad \u25a0 and - admirable â¢ charter
was secured - from \u25a0 Congress and . signed .by
President Roosevelt on January 12. 1906.' . .
: A gift of JI.CCO.OOO from Mr.' John D. Rock
efeller was immediately passed over to ~ the>
board, especially designated for educational
work in. the .South. Other, funds have been
added by other philanthropists since that time
and . the ' board has confined Its work hitherto
mainly to - educational - work In . the â¢ Southern
States.- \u25a0.
The present gift differs . from Mr. Rockefel
ler's first gift to the board In the following
particulars: â¢ â¢ \u25a0 .
The principal sum of the gift of $1,000,000
made on the organization \u25a0of the board could
be distributed. The present gift of J10.000.000
is- held as endowment, the Income only being
available for distribution. <~
The first gift was designed to bo used ex
clusively in the Southern States. The present
gift is for use -not 'only in. the Southern
States, but throughout the United States with
out- distinction of section. .â¢ \u25a0 " \u25a0' \u25a0 '
The first rift could bo used- for common
schools and secondary education: the * second
gift Is con.lr.fd to hlgfer education and' is de
signed especially for -colleges as distinguished
from the great universities, although there i*
no prohibition In the letter of gift against
making ; contributions to : universities. â : ,
Both gifts are alike available for denomina
tional schools as' well as for those - which arÂ«
non-sectarian. -While the -funds may â¢be em
ployed - for - denominational schools 1 , they Â« will
be. employed without sectarian distinctions.
No - special denomination will ba particularly
favored, but - the . funds will 'be open to ap-'
proved schools of alt denominations, although
they cannot be employed for giving specifically
theological - instruction.
.In distributing, the funds the board will aim
especially to favor those' lnstructions which ar*
well located ' and which have a ' constituency
strong and able to insure permanence . . and
power. No attempt will be made to resusci
tate moribund schools or to assist Institutions
which are so located that they cannot -promise
to be permanently useful.-- \u25a0 â¢ . * :- :>.
Within thtse limits. there are- no restrictions
as to the use of the Income. It may be. used
for endowment, for buildings, for current ex
penses, for debts, for apparatus, for any other
purpose which may be found most serviceable.
It " lÂ». known that Mr . Rockefeller has had
this gift in contemplation for a lon* tlm*. arid
Mr. Gates has been studyinr the subject In his
behalf for many months. .If. the fund proves
as, useful -as is now. anticipated Mr. Rockefel
ler will undoubtedly make large additions to it
in future years. ' '.

FIRE OF REVOLT STILL BURNS IN ODESSA
AND TROOPS KEEP CLOSE WATCH OVER CITY
TALE OF MURDER
OF SAILOR FALSE
Eye Witness Gives an Account of
Beginning of Mutiny.
Attack Is Made on the Officers
While They Are Dining.
LONDON, June 30.â The Standard's cor
respondent at Odessa, via St. Petersburg,
sends the following:
"A boat from the Kniaz Potemkine
landed nine officers, including one lieuten
ant to-day. They stated that the sur
geon, sub-lieutenant, an ensign and other
officers remained as prisoners.
"Thirty Bailors were killed."
An eye-witness supplied the following
account of the beginning of the mutiny:
"At noon Monday, while the Kniaz Po
temkine wae at sea. the sailors complained
to the lieutenant In comma:.d at that mo
ment that the food was bad. The lieu
tenant ordered the sailors to line up. At
his command those satisfied with the food
could go to the right; those dissatisfied to
the left. A majority signified that they
were satisfied.- The minority theq ran to
the armory and began to slaughter the
officers who were dining, all unarmed.
Many officers and ' sailors jumped over
board to Bave Xheir lives. Among them
was the captain and a lieutenant. The
mutineers then rained canister and case
shot from the six-inch gun into the water
and killed all but one sailor.
"The murder of a sailor by an officer
ia pronounced an invention. It is note
worthy that the sailors refused to allow
an assistant States Attorney to conduct
an inquiry, threatening to kill him if he
approaches the wharf."
It Is known that the seamen formed a
revolutionary committee of twenty be
fore the mutiny. Revolutionary orators
who are haranguing over the sailors' re
mains were declared officially to be
mainly Jews who were visiting Kniaz
Potemkine. It is officially admitted that
more than 300 rioters are dead and 100
wounued. including many Jews. â¢ The
mob k frenzied with drink.
Many chips have been burned besides
the Saratoff. They are mainly smaller
vessels.
The fire losses are incalculable.
OFFICIAL, VERSION OF 3IUTIXY.
Skr.vdlofT Sinys V- r*ent Trouble Is
Mere Drunken Annr.ij-.
ST. PETERSBURG. June 30. 6:25 p.
m. â The battleship Kniaz Potemkine,
according to official advices received at
the Ministry of c the Interior from "the
Governor of the province of Kherson,
In which Odessa is situated, left Odes
sa early this rooming for an unknown
destination.
The official version of the affair puta
an entirely new light Â« on it. It Is
'claimed that the mutiny on. the Kniax
Potemkine was the result of a plot
concocted by twenty sailors who were
n.cmbers of a revolutionary organiza
tion. The complaint of bad food, it
Is asserted, was a mere pretext. When
the complaint was made to the captain
of- the battleship he caused the blue
jackets to be drawn up on the decks
and asked those who were satisfied to
step out and it was seen that they
were In the majority. Thereupon the
minority, headed by the revolutionists,
who are said to have included foreign
anarchists, Belxed the guns and turned
them upon their comrades. A bloody
scene followed. Nine officers and many
men were killed or Jumped overboard
and the mutineers, , after placing the
remaining officers in Irons, took pos
session of the warship. Commander
Gokolon* was among the killed. The
red flag was hoisted when the Kniaz
Potemkine appeared off Odessa. When
the body of Omiltchuk <the man who
was shot by the commander of the
warship, according to previous re
ports), was taken ashore for burial it
was surrounded by crowds of students
and revolutionists, many of .whom
were Jews. Inflammatory speeches
were made and subsequently some of
the revolutionists went on board the
ship and assured the sailors of the
army's sympathy and readiness to co
operate with them.
The sailors then turned their atten
tion to the ships in the harbor and the
portion of the city along the water
front, which was soon on fire In many
places.
During the wild excesses of Wednes
day night about 300 rioters were killed
by tne troops and several hundred
were wounded, a number of them be
ing-Jews. Many drunken rioters per
ished In the flames.
Early last night the Kniaz Potemkine
opened fire on Odessa. The firing of
two blank shots was followed by two
solid Fhots. but they passed over the
town and did no damage. It is report
ed that the battleship then coaled and
provisioned from steamers in the har
bor and weijrhed anchor at daylight.
Three wounded officers were retained
on board when the others were sent
ashore yesterday morning.
: During the night many steamers In
the harbor which escaped the flames
sailed away.
" In concluding the narrative compiled
â¢ from the Governor's report, the official
who gave the information to the press
said:
' "Tbts Is not a revolution; It is mere
drunken anarchy."
Admiral .Skrydloff, who formerly
commanded the Black Sea fleet, declared
the Kniaz Fotemkine had the worst
crew In the navy.
: Advices received by the press from
Odessa say the firing on the town by
the Kniaz Potemklne wqs caused by tho
local authorities arresting two of the
crew who escorted tht body of Omilt
chuk to the graveyard. . After ono
\ projectile had exploded In a bouse In
~\ the center of the city, demolishing its
\upper portion, the authorities gavo in
"nd surrendered to the sailors.

TO M'ALLISTER
Special Dispatch to Tbo Call.

Napa. director of the Veterans' Home at
Yountville, made- a sensational reply to
day to the recent criticism made publicly
against him; by' Dr." W.> F. - McAllister,
medical ' director at > the Soldiers' Home.
Strohl said:
"Several years ago* I aÂ» a member of th*
board of - directors of the home took excep
tion to Dr. McAllister's management of the
institution and with some of the other direct
ors favored his removal from the superintend
ency. Unsatisfactory \u25a0 treatment of nlmates
and habitual drunkenness on the part of Dr.
McAllister were charged at that time. Ever
since that time Dr. McAllister's attitude to
ward -\u25a0 me has been the reverse . of friendly.
I ' believe that Dr. - McAllister has never been
a true friend of the soldiers at the home.
I have known him to complain when they
returned to the home ill. requiring care and
treatment, saying -he could not- dÂ» anything
for them. . I . have observed, too. a narrow,
childtst jealousy on his part toward the as
sistant physician at the home, who Is an ex
cellent physician and surgeon and in . every
respect competent, besides betas a favorite
with 'the t>atlenta.*Â£Â»Â£@Saf^
: I have for years been In â¢ favor et Dr. Mc-
Allister's removal from his position at the

"Dear sister,"= writes Medium Tully
to;hcr spiritualistic, fellow worker, ."we
must be settled withl If the, old man is
to be cheated Bart (Edwards)' and
Black must not be. the ones to do it."
This ,4s signed "Lizzie."
The thunderbolt was hurled when the
letter accusing Attorney 'Black was'
read. His client, Eldridge, had decided
:\u25a0.-. t to attend the afternoon .session
for obvious reasons. " ;!.'. ; "
"Black is taking everything in sight,"
read the letter. "Besides getting an
enormous salary of $11,000, I am con
vinced that he has got $15,000 more.
Rouse up all your forces. Have B.
< Bartlett) make me secretary of the
company. I must be in a position where
1 can have the laugh on Black."
"The Great Northern Railroad has
tcreed to pay us $25,000 for the right of
way,** another reads. "After a hard
fiÂ£ht Black agreed to send $S5OO of It. to
B (Bartlett). No wonder Black is build
liig houses. I want you to have Bartlett
Informed of this in strong terms."
For three years, 18S9-ISOO, and 1901, Mrs.
-Ar^ns and Mrs. Tully, according to the
kiters and to the medium's testimony,
palmed the request of Eldridge off upon
the old man as genuine messages from
tfce EDirit world.
SPIRITS ARE BXJXKO MEN.
The. work was so raw that at times the
o'.d roan took the ghostly advice with a
grain of salt. He must have often real
ized that the "spirits" of his" sons and
hi? old friend had turned confidence men.
"When the mediums saw his hesitation
th^y invoked the aid of the Indian
spooks. Buffalo Blanket and Men-a were
infallible, the mediums convinced him.
â¢Buffalo Blar.ket, through ! the inter
pretation ef Mts. Tully, consoled the old
man with promises of "bright and beau
tiful days in the spirit land" in the com
par.y of beautifu. squaws, who eagerly
awaited his coming. As was natural for
a ghost of his race, Buffalo Blanket was
rather illiterate. His written messages
were naturally misspelled and he spoke
of the epistles as "scratchums." ' This, as
every dime novelist vim say, is American
Indian for letter.
Eldridge. when pretsed for the $2500
promised to Mrs. Arem "after the work
was done." suggested a bunko enterprise,
through which the mediums might gather
in more shekels from the credulous.
"I have a proposition l!Â»re," he writes,
"thai you might have fixed through the
epirit of John Gervan, who passed out in
the East in *fcfi. His friend here has some
line property which he wants to leave
to oEcme nieces In the East, while he
wants to leave it to the those here who
stood by him." <
But Mrs. Arens refused to set her
gang of ghostly gold-brick men to work
on this lip. She wanted to see the color
of her $2500.
A letter from Eartlett 0 8. Edwards, one
of the alleged conspirators, to Eidridge
frhows how much chance she had of get- \
ting it. "If them damned women get any
thing," reads the letter, "it will be be
oause of you."
Â° o Â°ISES HIS DEAD FATHER.
Throigb. the Interpretation of Mrs.
Arens, Eldridge used me "spirit" of his
own father to assist in the graft. One
naive Mter from Postmaster Eldridge
reads in part: "I will write a little note
alÂ»out .what I think father â¢ had better
write to Bartlett (from the spirit land)!
If father wants to change v a little he
can <lo .s%and then have Rice <aleo in the
spirit land) write and ask him if he won't
dc a favor for an old friend ' who can't
rest till he does."
Through the interpretation of Medium
Arens. -father's" spirit, aided and
abetted by the useful but notorious Buf
talo Blanket, delivered the message. The
= SPIRITUALIST â¢ MEDIUM â¢ WHO CONVEYED PURPORTED MESSAGES ; FROM I >\
---SPIRITS TO- ERASTUS BAKTLETT.' THE AGED CAPITALIST.. SHE ADMITS
V>;;V 'BOGUS MESSAGES WERE GIVEN AT INSTIGATION OF HUGH ELDRIDGE.
MINNIE ADAMS
TAKES STAND
To-morrow Minnie Adams will probably
know her fate. The evidence in the case
of the woman who is for the second time
being "tried for- the murder of her two
year -*>ld boy In 1599 - has been closed . on
both sides and two of the attorneys have
made their. final arguments. To-day: the
case will open, at nine o'clock, \ District
Attorney Bylngton and former Judge Dib
ble will enter their last pleas to the" jury/
and by noon that body will have retired
to make its decision. . \u25a0 .
. Minnie Adams disappointed the many
hearers who had gathered in Judge Law
lor's court yesterday "to listen : to her
testimony on the witness ' stand; With
out a quiver of the eyelash, without any
sign .of inward ~ feeling, "without even the
apparent - desire -to appear to- the best
possible advantage,* . this .' woman told â¢in
an even, low voice the story of the death
of her little son. She .was not -confused
nor was she,. convincing. She did . not
help nor harm her cause.
John Tyrrell, father of the accused,
who . has been an- excellent witness" for
the defense all through the trial, swore
that his daughter never 'owned the cape
nor could have worn one like, the ;one
by which Officer Herliby recognized' her
the night the poison .was bought. This
fact Is one of the. principal points in the
defense, r'"^;- :' : .'.'H'/.''- â¢ \u25a0" .
old man was induced through this trick
to transfer property at Bellingham Bay,
valued at $80,000. '
Another letter reads: "When father
died I made over 25,000 shares ,~ of ' gas
stock to Bartlett. It. is now worth %50
cents a share. If you can get it back I
will give you: $1000." - . ;.
Mrs. Arens invoked the aid- of, her
ghostly bunko men, but the aged capital
ist would not part with the : stock.
According to Mrs. Arens \u25a0 she and Mrs.
Tully had been "treating" the old man for.
years. At first a clash of. spiritualists
was threatened,, but . finally, they - com
bined "in the good work," Mrs. Arens
put in a "spoke" for Mrs. Tully and Mrs.-
Tully putin a* "spoke" for. her sister me
dium. Their shadow " mentors, Buffalo
Blanket and Men-a, the ' Indian ' maid,
also laid their heads together in the land
of shades. Eldridge, Black and Edwards,
according to ; the /evidence, produced,
formed the triumvirate - that dictated
the messages to i the shades. ; ;
The taking . of Mrs. Arens' deposition
will be resumed this morning. . ; -

LONDON, June 80.â During f the dis
cussion Cof : the i naval /estimates in the
House of Commons. Edmund Robertson
(Liberal); a former civile Lord; of; the
Admiralty, \ asked; for further informa
tion I concerning the new battleships.
Mr.> Prettyman. | secretary of T the Ad

particulars \u25a0 of Uhe : new battl eships. but
said Great Britain proposed to lead and
notfollow other nations in naval con
struction. , 'â¢'\u25a0'-..
Sir John Colomb said Ire did not
agree with the opposition speakers in
saying the time; had come when the
naval^, expenditure ; might be reduced.
On (the contrary,- Sir, John said, every
thing pointed to f the necessity; ' for
keeping up the naval strength .of Great
Britain. The" real Question 'now is:
"Who lis going to rule the Pacific?"
President Roosevelt said the United
States Intended to rule , the Pacific.
The United States 'was; giving every
sign'that'thls was her intention by the
extraordinary Increase in her naval
power. . :
Sir John declared that in the not'dis
tant future -j auestlons wpuld arise in
the Pacific:; affecting the policy of Ja
pan, the .United ;States and' Great -Brit
ain. "He asked what Great -Britain was
doing against the time her inter
ests; ceased to be f identical' with 5 those
of \u25a0> the '{ two = great powers whose naval
bases were ; in; the Pacific. No one be
lieved that , the Anglo-Japanese alli
ance would last forever. Great Britain
looked with dread to a rupture with
the United States, but she could j not
shut her eyes to; the fact : ; that ruptures
had Toccurred - between the most friend

Government was , doing -to remind Can
ada .; and 'the! British colonies of the
great responsibilities which they, would
incur when their seaports and immense
interests in i the Pacific were imminent

Secretary Prettyman, replying to Sir

special Dispatch to The Call.
HEALDSBURG, June 30.â The property
owners and ranchers residing on the east
side of Russian River, across from and
above the spot where the Heaidsburs
Promotion .Club ! had started to construct
a large dam. have forced the club to sus
pend work. It seems that the Promotion
Club had . commenced work without get
ting consent of the land owners.
Two new summer resorts. Camp Rosa
and Camp Meyer, have started on Rus
sian River this year, and it was the ob
ject of the club to construct a dam that
would make a large artificial lake one
quarter of a mile wide and three miles
long. John lllgnalia, who would be the
property owner to suffer the most by the
backing up of the river, claims that the
current of the stream would be diverted
and would thereby wash away 7 part of
his land. Including a fine four-year-old
prune orchard.
Tfra committee has tried to persuade
him to permit the club to construct the
dam, but in vain. Ho threatens to secure
an * injunction if the work is proceeded
with. The club has already hauled all
the material necessary for construction to
the dam site. There is little probability
that the dub \u25a0will be able to accomplish
its purpose, as few of the property own
ers are willing to take the risk of havlns
their valuable lands Inundated.

EUGENE, Or., June 20.â 1t was decided
at' a meeting of hop growers to form a

districts In the State for the purpose of
forming the corporation. After its for

transferred to the corporation, which will
do the selling. After Oregon is organized,
it is proposed to extend the field of the
corporation to Washington and California
and then to New York and thus place the
control of the entire output of the United
States under one corporation.

DISCOVERED : BY ACCIDENT.
"Tin ore was discovered in Alaska 'in
the summer. of 1900 by gold miners who
prospected the various creeks tributary
to Lopp Lagoon for gold. But, doubt
lessly, stream tin was found, by the
Russians during their occupancy of .the
country. ; After ~ the discovery of tin.
practically nothing' was done until 1903
in. the way of locating 1 with a <
view to developing the tin mining
industry. Locations were made near
Tin City and on Buck Creek. The in
dustry is essentially a new one to
American mining men, and the average
prospector passed tin by, not \u25a0 knowing:
what it -was or. as something 'out of the
line of .what he went to Alaska for." The
discoveries % were made in the territory
near" Cape v York \ during the Nome ex
citement, and the discovery of tin was"
quite accidental. Miners in sluicing for
gold had their sluice-box riffles banked
and packed with the strange and heavy
metal, which was to them quite a seri
ous difficulty- to contend with in their
i work of getting gold.
."Assays from samples taken of the
tin ore assayed 52 per cent and as high
as 73 perjeent.
GOLD VALUES ARE HIGH.
gold. values In these creeks and

$640; per ton. Gold exists in paying
quantities on the creeks, but it is either
oxidized or covered with a ..coating,
making,* it difficult to distinguish from
the; stream tin. * It would not be , sur

The main lesson o* immediate: 'practical' lotV
pc rtanc-e to . â¢ California \u25a0 wine-makers ..; to be
leei-ned from these observations and experi
mcs.ts is the oit-repeateJ one of cool.fermen
tation. It teems su-ange that in Algeria,'
w litre cucl winter is.iar more, scarce, tbaa in
California, the v.-ine-makers should have bt-en
e\tle to make the use of cooling machines a
practical euccess. while here little or no â¢ pro
gress has been made in that direction. The
reason is to be found probably in a lack of
a real appreciation of the need end use of
cool fermentation among the wine-makers of
tlie regions where dry wines are usually made
and of the dilflculty of applying known meth
ods in the hotter regions, where the cellars are
nearly all of creat size.
TESIPERATUHE SHOULD BE LOW.
With regard to the first there is undoubtedly
a. very general lack of realization of thÂ»
benefits to be derived from fermenting wines
at a lot* temperature. A wine which attains
a temperature of 95 degrees to 100 degrees
Fahrenheit during fermentation will never
have the freshness, bouquet and general hlgf
quality of one which never exceeds 85 degrees
or 90 degrees Fahrenheit. Even though the
former ferments out completely and remains
a perfectly sound wine, its quality and es
pecially Its bouquet is Injured, and the head
lnees of many California wlneai and of wines
from other, hot countries, is undoubtedly due
In great part to the high temperature of
fermentation. The greater intoxicating effect
or a California wine with 13 per cent of al
oohol et-er a Chateau Margaux with 11 per
cent cannot be all ascribed to the slight dlf
ferenc* of alcoholic strength. The variability
of even the best brands of our California
bottled wines Is also In great part due to
tbe lack of a more perfect control of tbe
frrmeatlng temperature. Tbe California wines
which a traveler finds In the Eastern States
and 1b the hotels and dining cars of England
and the Continent are undoubtedly much su
perior to those hÂ« would have found there
fire or ten years ago. but they are still very
disappointing to one who knows bow good
they can be sometimes. Tbe first step to be
taken in establishing uniform and reliable
brands of line California wines is for the wine
makers to give their wines the uniform good
quality which can only be obtained by fer
menting every vat at ' a uniform and tlow
temperature. This will render the work of
the wine blenders and handlers comparatively
easy. .
With, regard., to the production of common
or bulk wlr.es the problem Is \u25a0 somewhat dif
ferent. Here, the main object , Is to produce
a wound Â«Ine of good keeping qualities as
cheaply as possible. The liner qualities of
bouquet, freshness and lack of heartiness are
of JÂ«rs- Importance. One of the essentials \u25a0of
cheapness is the production of heavy crops.-
Our cheap wires must be made, then, from
heavy-bearing rartetie* of vines planted in
rich solL The vineyards of Southern France,
where . common wines are made, produce from
eight to ten tons per acre, and even as much
as twelve to fifteen tons as the average for
v.hole vineyards. The vineyards of the Met
idja Plain In Algeria produce as much. There
are' immense tracts of land in the Sacramento
and S&n Joaquin valleys which are capable
o* producing equally large crops. \u2666 The ques
tion is. can these crops be turned into good,
sound. Cry. red wines.
Innumerable tests at the California experi
ment nation cellar prove that good, sound,
dry wines can be made from crapes grown
in rich. Irrigated and alkalinÂ« soil In-Krerno
and Tulare counties. Kxperiments even show
that wines of high quality can be made from
euch grapes. There is nothing, therefore in
the natur* of the grapes themselves, which
will prevent the manufacture of good dry
wines in the great central plain of California.
It remains to be seen whether a practicable
method of wine-making can be devised which
will overcome the difficulties . which hayÂ« so
far prevented tbe production of *uch wines
there. ill llHtfrarrnfll \u25a0 =-*
The most promising direction . in . which "to
look for such a method is at .present ii* line
with the experiments of Barba and the Berke
ley ' experiment station. Â« The method -In short
that offers an almost practical certainty of
attaining our object Is the following:
1. Heating the crushed grapes to a tempera
ture and for a time sufficient' to ' extract ; the
necepsary color, tannin and body.
:. 2. Immediate separation of the mutt and
cooling to W angr^et Fahrenheit.'
8. Immediate lorrm ntation of the must at a
temperature not exceeding 90 decrees Fahren-
TfcJs ie not to be understood ac a recom
mendatloo of this method for immediate - in
troduction into any cellar.. The present status
of the method Is this:
1. It has been **own. both In California and
In France, thai It' is poFslble, ivhrn worklnr
with small quantities, to attain the object in
view by this method. -t4BBNSPM|
2. Tbe method has been used with success in
France in the whole output of a cellar manu
facturing "S.OOO gallons of wine In a season.
It remains now -to be seen whether - the
method can be made practicable for California
conditions. A careful study . of thexe . condi
tions ha* left little doubt in -my mind that it
can. and the failure : of , all other, method*; that
have been tested so far male*"* it very desirable
that it rhould be given a thorough trial. -: There
are numerou* detail* of the method which hay*
to bÂ» carefully lmeftlKÂ»ted. but nonÂ» of them
offer* any apparently Infuperable difficultie*.

HUSBAND FINDS HIS
FAMILY HAS 'DEPARTED
Wife, Children and Furni
ture Take Wings' and
Fly Away.
OAKLAND, June SO.â Wife, child and a
houseful of furniture disappeared to-day
between daylight and dark with k not a
trace left of them. Such is the complaint
of T. Westholz, a ship joiner residing at
434 Forty-fifth street. ,
Westholz left home this morning to go
to work In San. Francisco. He bade his
wife and little girl good-by as usual.
There was not a suspicion of anything
wrong, according to the abandoned man.
When Westhola returned this evening,
with a bundle of household goods, he
found his home vacant and tenantless.
Every room had been strinped, from
kitchen to parlor. All that was left to
the astounded husband was his Sunday
suit of clothes.
The neighbors told Westholz that wag
ons had been hauling away stuff all day,
but ..they, could not tell him where the
belongings Â» and his family, had -gone.
Westholz . t aid the only explanation .he
could offer was his objection to permitting
a prospective son-in-law to occupy, the
house after bis wedding to a step-daugh
ter. But he added:
*_'I thought 'the trouble was all fixed up
when I kicked this man out of the house.
My wife, I . supposed, understood that I
would not stand for any- strangers. She
did not whisper a word about â¢ leaving
me." â¢'.''- â¢.

3[ariposa Sails To-Day for
Tahiti With Large Crowd
of Passengers.
The ship Agenor. left yesterday for
Alaska in tow of the Spreckels tug
Dauntless. The A&enor, which recently
changed hands, has the reputation of
bringing her owner good luck and the
circumstances of her present trip are
in keeping with this tradition. Joseph
Kildail, president of a ash concern In
Minneapolis, is the new owner of the
Agenor. He bought the ship to use her
as a box in whicii to pack the 2400 tons
of salmon he sold recently to the â¢Jap
anese Government. The salmon are
still swimming around in the waters
along the coast of Southeastern Alaska,
but already part of the cargo has been
paid for. The cash for the balance will
be turned over to Kildall's representa
tive at Seattle as soon as the Agenor
is loaded. . .
For ballast the Agenor is carrying
1000 tons of salt, in which the salmon
will be packed in the Agenor's hold.
No boxes will be used, the fish will not
even be washed. Affer the removal of
the entrails the salmon will be stacked
like cordwood in the ship's hold, a layer
of salt alternating with every layer of
fish. The' cargo, although still swim
ming in uncaught ignorance " of Its
coming visit to the Orient, is insured
for $55,000. Out of the profits of the
venture Kildail expects to get back
what he paid for the Agenor and have
something over. This is the first time
salmon has been shipped in this way to
Japan &nd the economy of thus hand
ling the shipment leaves the margin of
proiit wide and attractive. .\u25a0
The Agenor has earned big profits
â¢for her owners. before.* Eighteen years
ago she carried from here to Havre a
cargo of wheat at a freight rate of 198
shillings. From the profits of this voy
age the Agenor's sister ship. Con
queror, was built. A ship was char
tered here a few days ago for the same
voyage and the same kind* of cargo at
a freight rate of less than 23 shillings.
Kildail has a brother engaged in the
\u25a0whaling business. He is now building
a modern whaler and will establish a
station In northern waters fitted with
appliances which will enable him to
make commercial use of every part of
"any kind o> whale* .--<;.
WbaJe la Still In the Day.
The xihale that arrived In the harbor on
Thursday afternoon Is still la the bay. al
though as yet bis monstershlp has not entered
ci the Custom-house. He files no flag, and
may have Glain countless seals in forbidden
waters, but the Federal secret service people
have taken no steps to Indict or even croes
<juÂ«stlon him. If Admiral Goodrich were here
me wtoa.ie"s contempt for the rules of the road
would cause that gallant eeiior come displeas
ure. He has collided with nothing as .far as
known, but the pilot of every gasoline launch
ihat was in commission yesterday had a etory
of. more or less incredibility to tell about en
counteri with the big fish. At night he car
ries neither side lights nor riding light and
night and day carries on a little fire drill all
by himself. He found - the water In Mission
Hay a little 6trong, and after visiting Hunters
1-cint drydock and finding It occupied by the
liner Manchuria beaded for Alcatraz and spent
the afternoon in the deep waters surrounding
the military prison. It is supposed ,lhat he Is
coing a IHUe hydrographic work, and that
when his report, showing the magnificent dis
tances and depth of water in this harbor,
leaches the headquartere of Whale vllle, many
ether" whales will pay a vlelt to this port and
possibly sojourn here during the stay. in the
Arctic of the whaling fleet. Boatmen from
Hunters Point to Fishermen's wharf are
keeping a sharp lookout In the hope that the
water he swallowed In the vicinity of Channel
Ftreet may cause him to, cough up a chunk of
embergrls.

SINGLE TAX AND THE RAILROADS.
: :â: â " v
AN extensive lecturing tour is being made in the Slate by a
distinguished single tax orator from Chicago. His mission *
does not seem to be so much in behalf of the single tax as a
campaign for public ownership of railroads. The relation of this to
the single tax is not explained, and we do not undertake to ex
plain it. . -:'."\u25a0 \u0084
In his first address in Oakland he said": "American railroads
are capitalized at $50,006 per mile, when as a matter of statistics
the actual cost was only $25,000 for the average mile, and because
of this excessive capitalization the people of the country are forced
to pay excessive passenger and freight rates. Private management
is more expensive to' the Â° purchasing public than public owner
ship." ;>^
As a matter of fact the capitalization of American railways is
$61,000 per mile. On the Government roads of Germany, in public
oivnership, the capitalization^ $104,725 per mile. On the Gov
ernment roads of Belgium it is $167,898 per mile. On the Govern
ment roads of Russia $76,095 per mile. On the Government roads
of France it is $143,053 per mile. On the Government roads of
Austria it Â»s $110,475 per mile. Only on the Government roads of
Norway, Sweden and Denmark is the capitalization less per mile
than on the railroads of the United States. Yet the wages of the
labor that builds American roads are from-two to four times higher
than -the same labor gets for building the Government roads of
continental Europe. ' Under such circumstances the lower capitali
zation of our railroads is a remarkable economic fact, complimentary
to our country and not to be held up as its odium. In this country
labor gets 40 "per cent of the gross earnings of railroads, in England
it gets 27 and in Germany 35 per cent. Capital here gets less of the
gross earnings than in any of the countries where the roads are in"
public ownership.
The lecturer complains of excessive freight and passenger rates
in the United States, due to high capitalization. Yet the. rates here
are less than on any of the Government roads of Europe, and our.
roads pay the highest wages in the world to their operatives. _It js
difficult to see how an.hpnest argument for public 1 ownership can
be drawn from these statistics, which are official and "accurate. We
don't know the origin of the figures to prove that the capitalization
of American roads should be only $25,000 per mile. If they are
correct, they are nt> argument for Government ownership, based on
the conclusion that Government construction and capitalization
would be less, for everywhere it is greater than our capitalization
that is impeached as excessive. â¢ ; "
As the presence in the field of this lecturer, and of others else
where on the same mission, is evidence of a set campaign for public
ownership, to be carried into politics in the national election of 190S,
it is quite necessary that the people should act in full information
and with their eyes open. The indications are exactly like those 5
that preceded the free silver campaign of 1596. 'The premise of the
argument is now being given to the people to influence public
opinion. We deny the premise zs so far stated. American railroads
are properly subject to public control, as a Government function,
but not to public ownership as * Government business. We are to
have Coin Harveys and Bryans, Cyclone Davis and Tom Watson in
this new campaign for. lifting Government out of its place and mak-Â°
ing it compete with citizens in business. *
. The idea is as wild as -that legislation could give value to silver
or any other product, which came so near capturing the country
nine years ago. But -wild ideas flourish if not met and exposed.
When the statement is made othat the revenues of American rail
roads so largely exceed the income -of the Government, loose think
ers believe that an argument is made for Government ownership..
But the income of labor, as wages, in this country also immensely
exceeds the incdme of the Government every year. Who will from
that fact deduce an argument that all wages should be paid to the
Government? . . â¢ " .
The income of railroads is every year " redistributed to the
people. Labor, fuel and taxes 'gets more than half c the gross re
ceipts of American railroads. Capital gets less thaji one-quarter.
The people in some form get back more than Jialf what they pay. in
freights and fares. It is collected by the roads and redistributed.
The gross income of American railroads in 190^ was $1,900,846,907.
Of this $775*321.415 was paid as wages to labor, $146,509,031 for
fuel, $7,798,642 for lubricating pil and $57,849,569 for taxes, a total
of $1,557,478,657 paid out to the people and redistributed. The
balance was left for repairs; betterments, renewals, interest and
dividends. . â¢ â¢
â¢ THE YOSEMITE MUDDLE.
*""P*HE State of â¢ California receded the Yqsemite Valley and Mari-
J posa Big Tree grant to the United Stajtes last winter. There
* was doubj: about the method of completing the return of ; the
grant to the Federal Government. The valley is inclosed by the
Yosemite National Park, and this has been the causeVof many
mistakes. .
It. was announced in March that the recession had been ac
cepted by Congress. The Legislature made no appropriation .for
ir.e care of the valley, and it was supposed to have passed under
Federal control. Now it' is announced from Washington that this
is not the fact, and the State Commission retains jurisdiction of
both the valley and the grove.
The ponderous volume of "Statutes of the United States of
America, passed by the third session of the Fifty-eighth Congress"
has just come to hand. Its index says: "Yosemite, Recession of,
from California, accepted, â¢ page 1286." Turning, to that page we
find:, " ;
t;. "Public Resolution No. 29. Joint Resolution accepting the r re
cession by the State of California of the Yosemite Valley, grant and
the Mariposa Big Tree Grove in Â«the Yosemite National Park." "
Following that title is this text of the resolution: "Resolved,
By the Senate and House of Represents tives. of tHe United- States
in Congress assembled: That there is hereby appropriated from
any moneys in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, for-1 the
management, protection and improvement of the -Yosemite National
Park, to be expended under the supervision of the Secretary of the
Interior, the sum of twenty thousand dollars. Approved -March
5, 1905-" Not a word about the Yosemite Valley or the acceptance
of its recession. â¢' " ' .> v
To add to the muddle, the Big Tree Grove is not in the Yo
semite National Park at all, but is inclosed by the Sierra Forest
Resen-e. When the next Congress meets it will be in order for
some one to draw an acceptance of the recession, properly describ
ing the valley and the grove. Just how the title and text offthe
resolution got divorced no one seems to know. It appears to be one
of the curiosities of legislation.. .

MILLIONAIRE STOKES AND HIS FIANCEE
ADDRESS A CIGAR-MAKERS' MEETING
. FORMER. FACTORY WOKKER AXD HER MILLIONAIRE FTASTCE.
AS stated briefly in*the dispatches from New York at
the[time. Miss Rose Pastor, the east, side factory
â¢ girl'who is soon to wed J. G Phelps Stokes, the mil
lionaire University Settlement worker, caused a sensation
at the meeting of Cigar-Makers' Union No. 13 at the.Har
lem terrace, 212. East ORe Hundred and' Fourteenth street,' :
by walking in leaning on the arnV of Mr. Stokes. ,
It was the first public appearance of. Miss Pastor as a
speaker at a i labor, meeting, since her engagement , to Mr.
Stokes, and she and her fiance have Just causeto be proud
of-the welcome they. received, says the New York AVorld in
account of the visit.
".'.. Miss Pastor wore a becoming gray tailor-made gown
with a white enibroidered shirtwaist and a black cloth hat
trimmed with velvet and roses. Mr.. Stokes wore a" tweed
business suit and a.straw hat. .... r<
(."Welcome! A thousand, welcomes!" exclaimed Daniel
S. Jacobs, former' delegate' to the Central' Federated Union,
as he received the visitors. "We are proud, to have "you
with us and wish to thank you for the honor of your visit."
But las he. spoke. formalities 4 as to how the ; vlsitors.
should be received Â«vere settled by Miss Pastor, hef self, who
stepped smilingly forward and kissed, the young girls who
had. worked with jrfer. side by side in an east side.factorj-. ;'!'
Mr. Jacobs escorted Miss Pastor to a sqat.on the;plat
form beside Delegate Moses de Costa, who prorrfptly ad
justed his necktie and Ipoked very proud. Mr. Stokes sat,
near Miss Pastor. . . â
The meeting was , In the midst of a lively discussion
.when Mr. Stokes and Miss o Pastor .arrlv.ed, but that, was
'forgotten and with one accord the delegates requested MlssÂ°
Pastor td" make a speech. . ;â¢
" "Gentlemen and. ladles," she said, "I, have .been a cigar
worker myself, and I know all about the trials and tribula
tions of those/who work in that, trade/ Now that I am

-, The members could not restrain their enthusiasm at
this, and . they ; cheered -her again and agajn. Mr. . Stokes
also cheered. .'â¢?!/ * -
Miss Pastor then told; aÂ« pathetic little story of. a girl
who was the main support \u25a0 of: her parents. This v brought
tears .to the: eyes of every: one at the meeting. Including
Mr. Stokes.;' . .-. ' \u0084^
She said that the little girl,; who: was sickly, went to
the factory early In the morning and worked until late at
night in order to earn from $8 to $10 a "week. The, girl
was^compelledto sit In a chair which: had no back. This
gave her pains. In .the. back and she.*was almost unable to
.work. - Miss Pastor said she pleadedwlth the 'foreman of
the < factory rto provide the' girl ~ with' a proper chair, and
'after much difficulty It. was obtained. ' \u25a0;
â¢7 When Mlsa Pastor "finished her remarks .they gave her
three hearty cheers. .Then j the members all got In line- to
shake. bands with her 'and : to congratulate her." Miss Pastor
lookedtextremely happy.
* vMrV. Stokes, was compelled to make a speech also and
therewas great applause jw'hen he said:!
"I nope soon, to carry*- on â¢ the work of humanity on a
.more .extensive scale, with the assistance of Miss Pastor
when- she is . my wife, which.'l :hope will be. soon.' I am
glad that she is a trade unionist.".
>At the conclusion of Mr. Stokes' remarks , Delegate
Lapell made a mdtlon that he be made an honorary member
[ol the Cigar-Makers' Union, but the; point was raised that
as Mr; Stokes was not a cigar-maker the constitution would
â¢ have , to be changed .to admit him. This will be done at

yesterday : took* cognizance lof -the fact
that - hoodlums -, usingi the ' newsboys'
strike as a cloak were committing vari

Popular indignation was roused by the

had -\u0084 nothing :^ 'In "common with the

forced into making a show of action. .

The Mayor also issued the following
open letter- to " the newsboys, ..-'calling'
on them tp desist from taking part in
any violent acts: ' ;.
SAN, FRANCISCO, June 80, 1905.
To the Newsboys of San Francisco: I. am
your friend and the friend of all boys who seek
to earn : an honest \ living. | You ! hayÂ« my. sym
pathy and. the friendly, feeling of all good peo
ple who realize your provocation when a news
paper distributes - its papers : f roe in order to
prevent ; your selling a ' competing newspaper,
and. thereby attempts to take from you .the
little buslners which ' supports you and those
dependent ''upon - you. * 7 You : cannot, however,
succeed In winning your fight against such a
paper unless you obtain and hold the friendship
and confidence of the people. This you cannot
do unless you conduct yourselves In an orderly
and peaceful .manner. There must be no vio
lence, assaults or disturbances. .
If It Is true, - as some of you have Informed
me,' that the Bulletin has employed rowdies to
commit criminal acts and to rr.aka trouble so
that it may then be blamed on. you in order to
Injure \u25a0 your I cause, you | have an easy remedy.
Point .'out -the, offenders at once to the police
and have them, arrested. > \u25a0 .
. Fronv what-- 1., know, of the contemptible
character of Its proprietor and editor and from
the course Jof -" their newspaper, . I should . be
quite willing to believe that they are doing the
very things you - charge them -with, but this
does; not Justify : disturbances or breaches of
the peace on your part. " - ..'..
â¢ ' You must . not take the . law \u25a0 into your own
hands. The Bulletin .. has lied ' (.bout me day
, after day, yet you have never seen me taking
the law into .my \u25a0 own \u25a0 hands. ;i You :â¢ must . do
likewise. . f You must remember that I am the
Mayor of , the city. \u25a0\u25a0! not only of the newsboys,
but of the, newspaper, carriers and of the news
paper subscribers and : purchasers, and It is my
duty to protect . them ' also/ : . ,
. INO VIOLENCE v PERMITTED. .
. No" violence ' toward V carriers,* subscribers' or
purchasers â¢of ' papers will : be tolerated. You
. must bear this In mind and act accordingly.
and I have given all the officials of the city
Instructions to that, effect. lam sure you will
heed my suggestions, as they are given to you
In the most friendly spirit.: . \u25a0: -
IH I know . that It is hard to stand by and see
them trying to take away. your living by dis
tributing their "papers: free and to see hired
roughs do things that you are blamed for. but
nevertheless you must deport , yourselves In an
orderly manner ' and give your enemies no
chance 'whatever to : make, capital against you
on account of any, acts of yours. -.
By so doing you : will \u25a0' have â¢ the KÂ°Â°d will of
the people and a~ surer and safer: settlement of
your present troubles. Very truly yours. \.

\u25a0 â¢ -\u25a0\u25a0;Â« ".:. ' o .â¢ I
Budd Doble believes his stallion Kin' i
ney Lou, 2K)7\, is equal to the task of
trotting a mile faster than the one in
2:02',i trotted by Cresceus at Columbus.
Ohio. August 2. 1901. and" has decided ,to
prepare the son of MeKlnnt>y to make
the effort next year. He has Â° already
commenced giving: Kinney Lou slow work,
which will be continued with occasional
biushes during the fall and early 0 winter.
By March nbxt he will have him ready,
to begin giving him regular work. Ivln
ney Lou has all his spe< d. A week ago
Mr. Doble let him step 'an eighth of a.
mile in la.A seconds, a 2:04 xllp. "Kinney
Lou is such a perfectly galted horse that
the reduction *of his present record is
only a question of having him in condi
tion when the trial is made. As he. se
cured * his mark in a hard fought racVl
it is within reason to expect him lo knock j
several seconds from it in a trial against
time. Should Mr.' Doble succeed in driv
ing him a mile in better than two min
utes, the' trotting .stallion record would,
again come back to a "California bred'
horse. Thee record for mares, and for
all trotters for that matter, is held by
Lou Dillon, l:s#-i. The record for trot- o
ting geldings .(I:j9 s i> Is at ta the"
credit of Major Delmar, whose sire .was,
bred in California at 'Palo Alto Farm.
Santa Rosa ,has been selected as the
â¢place to hold the August meeting of
the Trotting Horse Breeders' Association,
and the 16th, 17th. 18th and 19th of
that month have been fixed" as the dates.
This will.be the regular annual fall meet
ing oorf r this organization, at f which the
three and two year old divisions "Sf the
Pacific Breeders' Futurity Stakes are to
be trotted and paced. The $2030 stake
for 2:24 class trotters and the $1500 stake
for $2:20 class" pacers Will also be features
of this meeting. o â¢ Â« .
The firsf meeting of the California cir
cuit will open at Los Angeles' next Mon
day. Everything points c to a successful
meeting, and it is more than probable
several 'State records will be broken.
o Harold D. the California pacer that has
been, making such, a good showing at
Denver, where he has. "won two races and
has been second "in another out of three
starts, now. holds a record of 2:ll*t, an.d
is' the fastest new pacer of the year^ He
never started In a raceÂ°BntiLhe reached
' Denver. \ Harold D was bred o by. A. B.
Spreckels' at Aptos Stock Farm and is
by the dead' sire Dexter Prince, his dam
Sunrise Second by Gossiper. He is ex
pected to set a mark of 2:07 or better be

troit Driving Club/by^arranglng" the pro
gramme for. the c Blue RibDort meeting
week of July 24-2S,on the three heat plan,
has solved dhe -problem ot equalizing the
Northern and Southern trained .Horses.
The three heat, plan removes .all possi
bility of a long drawn out such
as are frequentâ and which usualjy "re- !
suits In one or .more of the contestants,, ;
being put out of raciog commission for
a while, if indeed not for an entire' sea
son. When a horse starts *in one of
these races he need be ready for but
three beats. Should he, however, be just
a little short of work and annex two
heat?, he has won the larger amount of
the purse, and also the pool tickets are
his. The advantage the Southern train
ed horse had over the Northern* trained*
one in years pant Ib' now history. It has ;
often occurred that the Northern " horse
was really the best, but lack of condition
caused his defeat after he had won "two
heats and a record. Under the plan now
at Detroit the advantage of condition Js

DEMPSEY FOULS
JOHNNY CROWE
Just as -Johnny Crowe was about to
Swings through with a. haymaker in the
ele\-enth ;': round ; at ". the '. Colma Pavilion
last night his opponent. Young Dempsey,
struck; him a: foul blow below the belt-
Referee- Billy \u25a0 Roche at once tapped
Crowe ,on ! the shoulder and proclaimed
\u25a0 him' the winner of the bout. Crowe led
all' the; way* and had Dempsey ready to
take the count. Dempsey tried to lose. on
a foul in several of the preceding rounds
{'and his attempts were so* rank that
everyone in 'the house understood.
; Crowe , fought a wonderful battle and
his , opponent^ never ; had a chance after
;stlÂ»e'Â«niprf;had^one through the first round.
'The -Victor .was ,â¢ there with everything
Ui l] goes ' to';, make a great fighter. He
"punched I* Dempsey/,' at . will with both
"hands. Every, time* he cut loose Dempsey
Twas forced to break ground and cover up
jin order to* shield -.himself from an un
: mercl ful beating. r;'J .C^.fV .
| .*' One round war, simply ' a - repetition of
' another. Crowe was- the aggressor and
; the defensive flfebter:at the same time.
Whenever Dempsey started a rally, the.
! cool-headed little man met him fairly and
blocked the rushes with: his marvelous
guard. He would then shoot in right and
left in rapid succession, sending Demp
sey back discouraged and beaten.
For a boy who never went the distance
before, Crowe 'showed up like a champ
lon. * The ."only;, time Dempsey had a
chance was in the seventh when he made
a; wild rush and caught Crowe off his
guard, .landing a couple of stiff right
swings to the head and body. Dempsey
was encouraged by his success "and rush
ed . Crowe' around the ring. .At that, the
latter was i there and . finished , the round
strongly, landing a couple of Jolty rights
and lefts '.as'' the gong: sounded.' â¢.Dempsey,
tried ito i repeat ; the trick'- in the , eighth,
but this time ; Crowe met him' fairly and
sent jhlmUo* the. ropes a. volley of
all sorts of punches.
Dempsey commenced his fouling . tactics
in the ninth when he began to hit Crowe
low. He was warned by Roche," but paid
no attention " to the -.warning-." and fouled
several ; times while the crowd ; hissed. 1 In
the tenth, Crowe rushed his man all over
the ring and landed at will. Dempsey
was about all in in ' the eleventh when ' he
got a left swing on the Jaw. . He . de
liberately hit Crowe below the belt dur
ingamlxup and Roche promptly award
ed Ihe decision to Crowe. .
-,i George Brown beat Warren Zubrick in
the seventh ; round of \u25a0 the preliminary
when the latter: went = down twice with
out being hit and was disqualified by, the
referee. It was a .wonderful slugging
match ' and, -Zubrick came ", back -In . the
fifth : after taking the count \u25a0 four times.
He showed C wonderful . garoeness. -but
finally weakened under punishment i and
: tried to stall ' by sinking to the carpet.
Hisaction was too rough and the referee
Justly gave Brown the fight.
rfA'blg crowd -was In attendance and the
management provided "excellent street car
service. The bouts 'started promptly on
time" and ; the -fans were landed- back In
this r'city : at 11 :40. ; I ' . - r . . .'.

Uncle Henry's . Seals surely know
when to hit the. ball on the nosei They
offlced around at Recreation Park in
the second inning yesterday and " a3
the time -looked good three blnglera
were dispatched to the outfield. .These
three produced tyro runs and .these two
runs won the game. -Af ter that round
San Francisco went hitless. Scoreâ
San' Francisco 2. Los Angeles 1. .. ...
It seems a tradition that the deal?
must 9 wfn each,, and every game from
the Angels by a run. With the excep
tion of one contest all have been cap
tured with the assistance of that lone
tally. The Seals took every game save
two. Yesterday's victory and the down
fall of the Tigers- make the pace, hot
again, with the Seals right in line for
honors. ...-\u25a0-
Uncle believes in an early start, for
he sent his crew right off on the Jump
in round one. Spencer died, but >Wal
dron and Wheeler singled out to cen
ter. Waily went to third on Georgia's
clout and the latter secured the credit
of a stolen base. Hilda was not there,
but Charley Irwin made good In the
shape of a douser over Flood's head
that- brought pernp em both through ' with
victory right there. .
The Angels could not make good till
the fourth, when Cap Dillon dispatched
a double-sacker out to the - Scoreboard.
He traveled home as Brashear tore a
fast one through the - pitcher's box.
The' Angels, as usual, had \u25a0 chancea
handed them right and left, but they
overlooked every bet. just as they have
been* doing for many days past. " \u25a0' -
Joe Nealon's rough work cost Uncle
a run in the seventh. Joseph smashed
one to deep center that was good' for
a couple of bags in a canter. The lad
overlooked the formality of planting
his foot on cushion one as he tore 'by.
The play so rank that' every ; A no
'saw" It.' "even the umpire, and Joe .^ was
declared 'oat. ." . ~. --* ."
* Tozier pitched fine baseball. Dette'r,
in fact, than James the Whale. The
Seals seem to have that old Indian sign
hung over the head of every ' Angel and
it always counts when the time arrives
for making a run. or two. The score:

NEW TORK. June SO.â The call loan rate
t rose to 6 per <:ent to-day and |i,<Â» .*Â»>*culatl vÂ«
* movement in tl-.e stock market came to a halt.
There was a lively spilling otjt of stocks at -the
opening owing to yesterday's premonition of
the flurry in the call loan mark**, and some
wide declines ref-ulte* ftora the outset.. These
were not exceeded, in fact, during %hÂ« rest of
the day and the* markÂ»*t developed s. dull, re-
B'.sting tendency and'was partly sustained by
a f*-w poir.ts of paissive strength. But the vÂ«l
wne of dealings showed a _ notable shrinkage
end during the latter part of the day trading
came almost to a standstill. Tfce refusal of
the Stock Exchange authorities to comply with
a petition of members to close the exc!mng*
on Monday did not alter plans on the part at
many brokers to leave the city towlay not to
rmirn until after the Fourth of July holiday.
Tnere was little disposition in view of this
prolonged interval* to extend new commit
ments, the tendency being rather to reduce out
standing lines. The actual liquidation induced
wa* small and confidence lc still professed in
on Â«?arly return or abundant>ase in the money
market alter the turn ot the half-year.' â¢ Th*
rate for call loans touched to-day, however,
wat th* highest of the j*ear thus far, and'ex
ceeded the closing week of the last year, in
the period of prejAration for the annual settle
ments.- To-morrow's bank statement will re
flect the week's gold exports, which are njostly
responsible for the absorption from the market
on Subtreasury operations. It is expected tÃat
the remittance of funds from the mterior will
largely offset this. On ; the other hand.'.the
preparations for the July settlements are ex
pected to have in\'olved a heavy loan expan
rion. Next week alto there is to be met a call
for syndicate -payments of an installment on
the-WoÂ«ern Pacific bond - issu*. -The- hÂ«rder
| tone of the money market to-day resulted- in
f the appearance of bankers', nnance bills in the
K^ foreign exchange market, under which rates
receded rtill further from the goM export point.
Tne effect on the gold movement seems. to bÂ«
the only point of view from whicn Wall street
regards the Russian situation with apprehen
elon. . The , semblance of civil war reported
from Rusrian cities. therefore was of little in
terest in tbÂ« xaarket. , The return of Now York i
trust companies to, the State banking depirt
mÂ«it un#er. the call of Junej7 :was studied at
banking: circles to-flaj". .The'increase in deposits
over a' -year ago- wÂ»3 $246,315,724 and in. loans

PLAN TO JOIN
NORTHWESTERN
An Important move -in. the development
of railroad work in the northern part of
the State .took place .yesterday with- the
filing by -.the California: WesterrJ Railway
and Navlg'atlpn Company of â¢ papers of
incorporation 6t Sacramento, * which will
insure the. building of a road \u25a0 from ' Fort
â¢Bragg to tbe northern terminal of the
California Northwestern near 'WiHits.
This \rill give to San Francisco another
section of northern country to open up
and improve,' and .will be practically a"
subsidiary line to the California. North
western. ; -\u25a0;.".* ./'
. Frank Trumbull, president of tbe Colo
rado apd Southern Railway and also presi
dent of the Colorado Midland Railway, is
the president of the new road. 'part (it
.which is already bujlt" as a lumber line
from Fort Bragg to* Alpine. Bonds* to the
amount of' $300,000 have been placed in
Chicago, and the extension of the\road
from' Alpine to cither Willits.or Sher
wood "will be- begun before the year ends-
Officials of tjbe California Northwestern
were ' surprised -to heir of the move arid
will welcome, any additions or feeders ~to
themain.Hne. While this is'unexpected
it, was announced . yesterday at North
western headquarters that no move would
\u25a0be- made? by" the Northwestern to meet
thY proposed addition. . :
The section tapped by the new* road is
fich in Redwood timber and tlje Urribn
Lumber Company- owns 60,000 of the 150,000
acres that, will be opened up. The' lands
are somewhat broken and "sections are
adaptable to farming, while hunting arid
fishing are df the .best. All the' towns from
Westpcrt to the Nayarro River wjll be
within one day's ride of San F-rantflsco.

Hoiilth Officer Takes " Issue With Dr.
* Eccle'ii, .Who Takes Ground That '
'Adulterants Are Harmless.
. Irr his monthly report for June,-sub
mitted to* the .Health Board at its
meeting Thursday, Health Officer Ra
"gan refers to a book written by Dr.
Ercles upon s the subject of food pre
servatives, which* he says, has created
confusion in the mirids orMay Veadelfs
as 'to the effects of preservativ.es. Ec
cles Is quoted as saying -that ."more
deaths occur from the use of foods not
treated by preservatives than those
treated by preservatives, as shown by
the statistics of deaths reported from"
'toxicosis, chief. of w,hich are cases of
ptomaine poisoning, than deaths from
recorded -cases occurring after the use
of j preservatives i/i *. foods." Ragan
says: v . ' \u25a0\u25a0 . . V.
The .calmer view of this statement shows
that no classification of statistics shows the
contributory causation of . preservatives, while
statistics do furnish a contributory agency or
impure food* as a casual factor. Dr. Eccles
.also champions the uso of preservatives on
the ground that It satisfies an economical so
cial want In ;Hat the use of ' them -, lightens
the burden upon the poor consumer.' This Is
true, but the ultimate conclusion is that while
It lightens tbe burden of to-day upon the pres-.
ent consumer, \u25a0Jt adds to the burden -. of - the*"
race Â«in that It . Introduces a factor : which
counts for decay and degeneracy; fend, as a
race deteriorates, so S th% ,very foundation ;of
eoclety ccumbles *\u25a0. and the economical policy
hae at last proved' suicidal. .. . ..- : .

JAMES C. CRAWFORD.
Patrolman -Skain, who most relentlessly
pressed . an ' , accusation of vagrancy"
Â«gaiwt Borneo- E.'Buttner, testified that
the defendant was the j greatest* "cut-up"
on. the Barbary O ist. the femininity, of
that region, being"* Especially. _ regaled by
his oral quips and salt'atorlal antics. In
deed so amusing was he to the fairer sex
that his arrival in a dance hall was equlv-
alent-to a signal for cessation of regular
business, .'and for .that reason Â« he was rer
garded as an unwelcome visitor by the
manager's/ all of whom -would rejoice U
lie w.ere Incarcerated for a long, term. "On
more than one occasion, w.hen the .floor
was packed with waltzers ' and .the | bar
was doing a roaring trade, Romeo entered
and said or. did something so ludicrous as
to compel the ladles to control" thjelr
rjsibleo by* pressing their sides, thus In
capacitating them for terpsichorean effort

Romeo, a w.eak-eyed,Â»blonde young man
of fragile physique, . answered : Judge Mo
han's query by asseverating that he
could not help creating amusement and
did riot create It Intentionally. , His con
stant effort was to appear serious, but
the harder he strove in;" that^dlrectjon
the more he was laughed-at. At the time
of .his arrest, for instance, .his demeanor
was most grave, but the petticoated per
sons who surrounded him at Kearny and
Pacific streets screamed with mirth at his
every word and gesture. \u25a0 He tried to as
sure them that' ho was not feeling ..well
and did riot mean to be .funny, and the
more. earnestly he pleaded t*he lpuder did
they? guffaw. One ; buxom *danseuse told
him that .if he did riot "let up": he would
be the death of her, .she knew he would,
and another lady of the same profession
informed him that she, too, Would be
driven to a premature grave if. he con
tinued his "joshing." was hard, 'he
argued to the Judge,*! to; be accused .of
performing comedy when s the - perform
ance* was Intended to tie pathetic, if- not
tragic. * When^ the police officer placed
him under, arrest afid he complained of
his . custodian's conduct as bejng "real

FIGURES READY
ON ASSESSMENT
'Assessor Dodge late yesterday even
ing practically completed his assess
ment on personal property and real
estate valuations, which he figures at
A grand total of approximately $520,
000,000.
The roll for 1906 therefore shows an
increase of some $17,000,000 over the
roll for 1905, when It was $502,892,459.
Whefn Dodge began the compilation
of "the assessment roll " he was con
fronted .with a loss of nearly $5,000,000
on personal property holdings valued at
under $100 -in each Instance, and Â«on
national bank stock, both of which are
exempted from "(taxation "by law. This*
year's roll therefore shows^ an actual
net actual increase Of about* $22,000,000
over that of last year.
â¢This is a remarkable showing In view
of the fact that last year's roll showed
an increase of more than. $75,000,000
over: the year previous. It wasÂ»not cx r
pected that this year's increase would,
be * anywhere -so large an â¢ amount^ as
Dodge had last year \u25a0 raised the assess
ment'on rear estate in various parts of
the city to its utmost limit In his policy
of equalizing assessments. * .â¢
- The budget -and city, tax rate of
$1,164 was based on estimated assess
ment of $510,000,000^ so the $10,000,000
increase would' net .the city \u25a0 some
$100;000 additional revenuei This "will
be the case should Dodge's flgjires^not
be reduced by. the Board of Supervisors^
acting as a Board of Equalization. The*
board will meet during the. next two
weeks to . hear petitions f or .' reductions
and* corrections of. errors in the asse'ss
meht, but it is not expected that a great
reduction will be matfa on' that score, 1
the : figure being estimated *at some
where between $1,000,000 and $2,000,000.
