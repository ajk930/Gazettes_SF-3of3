WASHINGTON, March 21.â The
House Committee on Judiciary to-day
voted to impeach Charles Swayne, Fed
eral Judge for the District of Florida.
The committee reached this conclusion
at a session lasting from 2 o'clock until
6. The vote and the details of the
charges which will form the ground of
impeachment the committee agreed to
withhold until the report on the case
has been completed for presentation to
the House. This report is to be drawn
by Representative Palmer of Pennsyl
vania, chairman of the sub-committee
which took the testimony In the. case.
Of this sub-committee Palmer, and
Clayton of Alabama reported to the. full
cdmmittee in favor of impeachment,
while Representative Gillette of Cali
fornia reported against it.
Palmer's report will be prepared this
week. If the House votes to Impeach
Judge Swayne two of its members will
be appointed formally to notify the
Senate, before which body, sitting in a
judicial capacity, the case must be
tried. The case against Judge Swayne
would be conducted : by six Â¦ managers
who would be members of the House,
elected by that body by ballot for the
work. Judge Swayne, after the case
has been presented to the Senate by
these managers, will be given an op
portunity to present his side of the
case.
While the committee has . voted to
give out no details at present, it. Is
known that the charges on which testi
mony was taken include those of being
absent from his circuit, being a non
resident of v his district, imprisoning a
lawyer in contempt proceedings, im
prisoning the son .of a litigant also for,
contempt of court and refusing to hear
a certain witness in a case before him,
alleging that he would not' believe the
witness under oath.
The last impeachment proceedings
were the case of Andrew Johnson. Only
three Federal Judges have been Im
peached. The proceedings against
Judge Swayne if carried to the Senate
undoubtedly will delay .for several
weeks the adjournment of the present
session of Congress. If the Senate de
cides against Judge Swayne the pen
alty attached to the decision is loss of
his Judgeship.

WASHINGTON. March 21^-In, an
opinion by Justice Holmes, the-Unit
ed States Supreme Court to-day unan
imously upheld the local option law of
the State of Texas.. The case was that
of G. Rippey vs. the State of .Texas.
Rippey was ] convicted of selling liquor
contrary to the law and- the State
Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed the
verdict. Justice Holmes said that in
asmuch as the State had absolute con

borders Rippey had no case under the
Federal constitution.
ST. PETERSBURG, March 21.â The
Novoe Vremya publishes prominently a
Paris dispatch declaring . It", is .believed
there a ; triple ' alliance : between- Japan.
China and Korea has been formed,
which was the real object of the Mar
quis Ito's visit to Seoul. .
The Foreign Office gives an absolute
denial to the statement telegraphed
from here that Korea is regarded as a
belligerent. Russia, as previously ex
plained, holds all the acts of.;: Korea
since the declaration of her neutrality
to.be void, as Korea is under Japanese
duress, and unless the Korean Govern
ment formally notifies. the powers that
she has joined with Japan and -taken
up arms Russia will consider her neu
tral. Any Korean troops which.actu
ally impede Russian movements or join
the enemy â¢will be considered individual
belligerents -without reference to their
nationality. . * ""â¢'.
The statement that the Russian Min
ister at Peking has demanded the
withdrawal of all Chinese troops north
of the great wall also is incorrect. As
cabled, Russia has made representa
tions about, the number of Chinese
troops in the neutral zone, west of the
Liao Rh>er, j hot desi ring a force there
which -would constitute a threat, and it
is understood China has given-assur
ances on the subject.
LONDON, March 21. âA number of
rumors. are printed in the newspapers
here this morning, but they must be
accepted with great reserve." The Daily
Telegraph's Tokio correspondent cables
a report of the Japanese occupation of
Port Arthur after a combined land and
; sea attack on Saturday andSunday. It
: Is asserted that a division' of Japanese
landed on the Llaotung Peninsula on
Saturday and engaged the Russians
near Port Arthur, while the fleet bom
barded from Saturday evening until
Sunday morning.
The same correspondent reports a
sharp encounter at Changsieng, on the
Yalu River, about thirty miles north
east of Wiju, in which the Russians
lost 600 In killed or wounded.
The Daily Chronicle's Shanghai cor
respondent hears from Newchwang
that the Japanese crossed Tatung Pass,
forty miles from Haicheng, and that
collisions with the Russians occurred.
Reports from. Seoul and Tokio are to
the effect that Marquis Ito has ar
ranged to lend 5,000,000 yen ($2,500,000)
to Korea, on, easy terms.
According to the Standard's Tientsin

the powers for an extension of a year

FEARS ALLIANCE
BETWEEN JAPAN,
CHINA AND KOREA
XPTWCHWAXG. March 21. â The reports of heavy guns were heard this morning down the; coast, the
firing coritinning at frequent intervals for a half-hour after 7 o'clock. Apparently the firing was taking place
six or eight miles south of Yinkow, the port of Xcwchwanjj. It is believed that Admiral Makaroff made a dash
out of Port Arthur and engaged a squadron of Japanese warships, which ! were covering an attempted land
ing of troops. Owing to the hazy weather it was impossible to distinguish! objects at sea. A small squadron
of warships was seen yesterday off the western coast. of Liaotuug Penliisuln. biit whether they were Russian
or Japanese Is not known. It is believed the Japanese arc attempting, a landing In. force below Xcwchwang. '
SHANGHAI, .March 21.â It is hard to get '.-confirmation of the news but it Is believed" n great battle has been
fought In Manchuria and] that the Russians have been defeated. Several tralnloads of Russian wounded have '
passed Tashichiao, en route to the bawe hospital at Llaoyang. Reports have been' received, here that an action
took place near Tailing Pass: that the' Japanese crossed it. and that the Russians .were forced to retreat with
heavy loss. The way is now open for a general Japanese advance on Moteinllng;.. Tills place is held in force by the
Russians. Russian reinforcements arc concentrating in the neighborhood of. Xcwchwang.
LOXDOX, March 21. â The correspondent of the Times at Seoul cables: "The latest news from the front
precludes any belief in the rumors which arc circulating with regard to. renewed fighting. It appears that the
only fight which has taken place up to date was that. of which news was telegraphed ten days ago, which re- i
Milted in a single Japanese casualty. The Russians are slowly retiring. The total number of their troops south
of the Yalu River, it Is believed, does not exceed 1500. The unconcerned manner" in, which the Japanese are advanc
ing indicates that no serious collision is likely to take place In'the immediate future." * . Â¦'â¢'* V - 'â¢

the '-enemy -at Harbin'ahd Mukden, it
is \held i that . this completely changes
the military situation, requiring that
the Japanese push inland, thus giving
up their, strong - naval '*- support. *As
their land forces are comparatively
limited : for an invasion of Manchuria,
it Is the -belief in \ high quarters here
that | they will j Increasingly feel the

that Japan will openly seek the aid

VICTORIA, B. C, March 21.â
Wreckage has been found by Indians
off the entrance to Uclullet Arm, on
the west coast of Vancouver Island.
Among the wreckage picked up were
two bundles of paper with the address
of Douglass Malcolm, chief officer of
the British ship Lamorna. Other
wreckage found was some lumber, one
inch by one-half inch, painted white;
a photograph wrapped in papers, three
empty copper tins painted white and
other things. I
The Lamorna sailed from Clallam
Bay February 29 with a cargo of
wheat and barley.
SEATTLE. Wash.. March 21.â A spe
cial from Victoria says: More evidence
accumulates that the Lamorna Is a
wreck. In addition to the papers and
tins found, later information shows
that wreckage is being picked up all
along the shore from Cape Beale to
Uclullet.- Â»It includes oars, barrels and
other flotsam and points unmistakably
to a wreck having taTcen place. * The
Indians about Cape Beale are reported
to â¢ have seen a large ship close In
shcre on Thursday during a storm and
it is more than "probable that its de
struction has followed. Possibly the
ship was overtaken by the big storm
of a week ago last -Thursday night.

WRECKAGE
TELLS OF A
TRAGEDY
Defending Chinamen against the
charge of Immorality, Lyttelton read a
letter from the Bishop of British Co
lumbia saying that .the Chinamen were
In no way a debauched community, but
lived quietly and soberly. There was
no evidence that ther-lmported new or
despicable vices. The policy of the Gov
ernment in South Africa, the Secretary
explained, was one of development. A
fair proportion of the product of the
mines would be used In maintaining: the
educational institutions, the Judiciary
and the civil service at the highest
standard.' The prosperity of British
Columbia and California. Lyttelton as
serted, was based on gold mines won
by Asiatic labor.
In conclusion the Secreta/y warmly
defended High Commissioner Milner
against the charges of pandering to the
mine, owners, and said he hoped the
Government'^ policy would have the
support of the House.
In â¢ the course .cf the, debate of Sir
Henry Campbell-Bannerman's motion
at the night session Major John Ed
ward Seely. who hitherto has been a
consistent supporter of the Govern
ment, said he believed the importation
of Chinese labor would render the
Transvaal impossible as a white man's
country. He announced that therefore
he had to-day tendered his resignation
Colonial Secretary Lyttelton, reply
ing, indignantly repelled the allegation
that the Government was favoring
slavery. He said the agitation on the
part of the opposition was merely for
party purposes; but possibly the
statesmen of 1SS0 were wiser than the
distinguished gentlemen now occupy
ing the front opposition benches.
:.V DEFENSE OF CHINESE.
Sir Henry concluded with dissecting
the ordinance, laying special stress on
the provision to the effect that any one
harboring a deserting Chinaman would
be treated as a receiver of stolen goods.
If this did not constitute slavery, he
said, the difference was indistinguish
able.
In the House of Commons during the
day the Liberal leader. Sir Henry
Campbell-Bannerman, moved his vote
of censure, presented March 16. to the
effect that "this Hot^e disapprove the
conduct of his Majesty's Government
in advising the crown not to disallow
the ordinance for the introduction of
Chinese labor in the Transvaal."- . ",
Sir Honry said nothing the Govern
ment had done since the close of the
South African war had so sorely tried
the people of this country as its sanc
tion of the introduction of Chinese la
bor into South Africa. If the new de
parture was cot checked it would be
Â¦> source of future weakness, not only
to the Trar.svaal, but to the whole of
South Africa, it was impossible to con
ceive a greater departure from the
principles by which Great Britain had
hitherto made her way in^the world
than the importation of aliens as the
bondsmen of mining speculators.
The Europeans in South Africa, Sir
Henry declared, were by a large ma
jority opposed to Chinese labor, and
the object of his motion was to stop
the Government's policy in its earliest
3tase.
The Bishop of Hereford, interposing,
objected to the Imputations on the mo
tive of his speech, but Lord Goschen
declined, amid ministerial cheers, to
acquit the prelate.
Â¦ Lord Goschen- concluded with a
eulogy of Lord Milner personally as a
"faithful servant of the crown."
Lord Coleridge's motion was reject
ed by a vote of 97 to 25.
GOVERNMENT CENSURED.
John Percival, D.D. (Liberal), Bishop
of Hereford, severely criticized High
Commissioner Milner, who, he Â«aid.
was utterly disqualified to hold a high
office on account of his temper, which
obscured his Judgment, and the fiery
language which he scattered through
out his dispatches. The mine owners,
the Bishop added, wanted the ordin
ance, but the owners did not represent
the people, who were opposed to It.
Lord Goschen (Liberal Unionist)
warmly defended Lord Milner. He said
the charge that he was acting under
the influence of the mine owners was
unworthy of the House of Lords.
LONDON. March 21.â Chinese laber
in the Transvaal was debated during
the entire session of the- House of
Lords this evening on a motion of Lord
Coleridge (Liberal) that "this House
disapproves the importation of Chinese
laborers into the Transvaal under the
recent ordinance until that country
has been granted a full representative
Government."
"Before this, however, he had al
ready given a trust deed to E. B.
How as trustee to secure possible
thortages. Upon further investigation
by the National Bank Examiner a fur
ther shortage was discovered by him.
Upon the latter's advice the directors
made this good to the bank and the
entire satisfaction of the National
Bank Examiner."
Immediately after the issuance of
this statement a warrant for Hayis*
arrest was placed in the bands of
Sheriff Coburn, but some, of Hays'
friends had informed him and he could
rot be found. To-morrow the direct
ors intimate that there will be other
charges as the basis of additional war
rants.
The following official statement was
issued to-night at midnight by the
b^ard of directors as to the shortages
Â¦which have thus far been discovered:
"About the time of the resignation cf
Mr. Hays as cashier there appeared to
be a shortage of $5000, which sum had
boen r>aid to Mr. Hays but had not
been jfurned over to the bank. This
v availed to Mr. Hays' attention. He
secured this sum and paid the bank.
Afterward a further shortage of $1900
was discovered and charged to Mr.
Hays, who paid the sum back to th-i
bank. Subsequently further shortages
aggregating Jis.000 were discovered.
Mr. Hays was asked to pay this sum
back to the bank, but was. unable to
do so, but instead he gave security In
the form of a trust deed to A. A. Adair
as trustee.
til nee then Hays has been defying
those whom he said had been perse
cuting him. Meantime the National
Bank Examiner had been at work.
The result was the discovery of short
ages in the bank, the amounts of
which the directors refuse to make
public. The bank is fully protected,
the members of the board of direc
tors have drawn upon their private
fortunes for amounts sufficient to
make good Hays' alleged peculations.
They possibly would have refrained
from proceeding criminally against
Hays but for the credit of the bank;
but now that the warrant 'is issued,
the directors declare that they will
push the case to the conviction of the
accused if that is possible.
STATE3IEXT OF DIRECTORS.
Hays was until recently the political
boss of Riverside County, leader In most
of the social movements, a factor in
all public matters of magnitude and
the Beau Brummel of this section. Sev
eraJ months ago it was discovered that
in connection with the agency for the
Fait L^ke Railway Company he had
been connected with land frauds which
netted him many thousands of dollars.
Upon the discovery of his connection*
with these deals he gave to the rail
way company trust deeds for $12,000
worth of property, and later the matter
reached the civil courts, but Hays was
rever prosecuted criminally. His land
frauds resulted in the dismissal of Col
onel J. W. F. Diss as claim agent of
the railway company.
EXAMINERS INVESTIGATE.
RIVERSIDE. March 2Lâ As a result
of a meeting of the board of directors
of the Orange Growers' National Bank,
the biggest financial institution In
Riverside County, late to-night a war
rant was issued for the arrest of H. T.
Hays, former cashier of the bank, on
a charge of felony embezzlement. The
amount of the peculations of Hays is
not known, but that it exceeds $35,000
Is admitted by those In position to

' Premier Balfour, who followed Major
Seely, was unable to secure a hearing,
the Irish members protesting against
the treatment of the major.
, William Redmond said that Balfour
should have insisted upon a respectful
hearing for Major Seely, and when the
Premier said he lyid appealed for such
a hearing Redmond withdrew his oppo
sition and the house again quieted
down to listen to Balfour, who in op
posing the resolution said It was a
question whether the Transvaal should
be allowed to go through a. grave com
mercial crisis rather than admit Chi
nese labor. Liberal governments, he
said, had in the past legalized, the im
portation of such labor for British colo
nies, and the opposition was now, reap
ing the benefit of the evils which their
party had produced. ; .

In regard to the use of coal tar dyes
in foods. Bulletin â¬6, Division of
Chemistry, United States Department
of Agriculture, says they are more gen
erally used 'than colors of vegetable
origin because they are cheaper and
more durable. "The coal tar colors
are always liable to contain metallic
impurities, such as zinc, copper, tin",
Joad and arsenic, retained during the
process of manufacture, and which,
when introduced' into the food, even
in the small quantities they use, are, to
say the least, a source of danger."

Two other tawns in this section were
in the- path of the storm. According
to meager reports that are received
here to-night, houses in both places
have been wrecked and there may have
been great loss of life.
The grocery of J. W. Ensely, in the
business part of the place, was wrecked
by the storm. John Dolphen, a clerk,
was mortally injured and probably will
not live thro.gh the night. One leg is
broken in two places and he is inter
nally injured. It is estimated that 2000
windows were broken by the, storm.
HIGGINSVILLE, Mo., March .21.â
Fifty buildings are wrecked, one man
is mortally wounded, many others are
hurt, the town is in darkness and the
streets are strewn with debris as the
result of a tornado and hailstorm which
struck this place late this afternoon.
The hail on the streets was a foot
deep within five minutes after the
storm came and some of the hailstones
were phenomenally large. Dozens of
trees in the town were blown down and
several horses were killed in the streets.
The sterm came without warning.
The wind and hail came first and were
followed by a terrific downpour of rain,
which flooded nearly every cellar in the
town. The storm came from the west,
traveling eastward. It kept with\n a
narrow path, at least the tornado por
tion.

Secretary Taft was heard at length
and as it had been generally under
stood that he was, a pronounced oppo
nent of the bill his testimony was a
surprise and 'discouragement to the
hemp and cordage representatives who
have been fighting the measure. He
strongly indorsed that section of the
bill relating to interisland traffic.
The secretary stated that in his
opinion the hemp industry would not
suffer under the proposed bill. The
only possible harm which would re
sult from such a bill would be to the
trade in sugar and tobacco, which, he
explairied, does not now exist, but the
Philippine Government and himself
are trying very hard to stimulate.' It
was because of his great desire to
build up the trade in these two prod
ucts that he advocated a reduction of
the tariff on them to 25 per cent of
the Dingley rate. He had hoped that
such a measure could be passed with
the pending bill. In the long run he
foresaw considerable advantage in
the application of the coastwise laws
to trade between the. United States and
the Philippines, as the employment of
American ships in the carrying trade
would lead to the introduction of
American capital Into the islands and
so delevoplng their resources.

OF THE PACIFIC COAST
PARIS, March 21.â In the Chamber
of Deputies to-day the Government
again met with a slight reverse. Dur
ing the discussion of the religious edu
cation bill, after the adoption of the
clause providing for the extinction of.
the teaching congregations by the sup
pression of novitiates, Georges Ley
gues, Radical Republican, moved' an
amendment excepting from the opera
tion of the clause such novitiates as
were intended to provide teaching
staffs for schools abroad, either in the
French colonies or the French protec
torates
Leygues, in speaking to the amend
ment, dwelt on the services which the
congregations had rendered in advanc
ing French ; interests, especially in
Madagascar, and pointed out the neces
sity of .counteracting the influence of
British, American and Norwegian Pro
testant schools, which, he said, were
working In the interests oj their re
spective countries.
Doumergue, Minister of . the Colonies,
insisted that French interests would be
best promoted by the extension of
purely lay schools.
' Before a vote was taken on Leygues'
amendment there was a clamorous de
mand for a statement of the position
of the Government regarding the ques
tion, but Premier Combes refused to
reply, whereupon the amendment was
carried by a vote of 283 to 272.
John Ochsner of 112 Beulah street,
was walking in the park by the south
drive about 5 o'clock when he was at
tracted by the young woman's groans.
She lay with the empty acid bottle and
the note beside her. He hurriedly noti
fied the park police station, and the
girl was removed to the Park Emer
gency Hospital, where she died twenty
minutes later. Dr. Wilson did all in
his power to save her life, but his ef
forts were in vain. Miss Jalumstein
never regained consciousness.
The unfortunate girl was formerly
employed by I. W. Hellman, the
banker, as a stenographer, but was
compelled to give up her position on
account of ill health. She lived with
her widowed mother, and brother at
312 Gough street. Her brother, David
Jalumstein, is the proprietor of the
Jalumstein Printing Company of 310
Hayes street and a small paper known
as the Hayes Valley Record.
The unfortunate young woman had
been Buffering from illness for the last
year and a half, and had been under
the care of Dr. L. L. Meininger of 807
Sutter street for some months past.
Yesterday she wrote a. note to her sla
ter, Mrs. Sapiro of 664 Sixth street,
bidding her good bye and saying that
she was tired of a life of suffering.
The agonized sister immediately began
a search for the girl, without finding
her.
"Have my miserable remains cre
mated without the least bit of fus3,"
was the note left by Miss Estella
Jalumstein, a 19-year-old stenographer
who committed suicide yesterday after
noon near the south drive in Golden
Gate Park, by taking a dose of carbolic
acid.

mained there until February 12, when
I got away on the German cruiser
Hansa. The Russian fleet went out
side the harbor each day af forward,
but saw nothing of the enemy.
"After the engagement I saw one
unexploded shell in a garden and frag
ments of many others. As far as I
could learn only one man. a Finlander
pilot, who was struck by a fragment
of a shell, sustained any injury. After
the bombardment all of the women and
nearly all the remaining Chinese left
Port Arthur.
"That bombardment, while a short
affair, was full of excitement and little
imagination was necessary to get out
of it all the thrills I was looking for.
The flying shells interested me at first,
but I soon awoke to the fact that the
fight was not mine and I took refuge
behind the hill.
"The following morning I went
ashore and at 11:30 o'clock the forts
opened fire, followed by a bombard
ment from the Japanese fleet. The
bombardment lasted only a half hour,
but it seemed an age. Shells flew thick
and fast and panic reigned among the
inhabitants. Chinese laborers packed
their little belongings and In scared
droves fled from the city. The scare
they received will not be forgotten and
while the war lasts Russia will have
a lively time inducing Chinese labor
ers to accept employment at Port Ar
thur.
"The torpedoes exploded several hun
dred yards from where the Wenchow
lay, but if they made any noise I did
not hear it," said he. ' "I was asleep,
but am a light sleeper and had the
noise been great it certainly would
have aroused me. The next morning I
saw the two battleships Retvizan and
Cesarevitch aground. It seemed then
that neither vessel would ever go into
Commission as a warship again, al
though as long as the Russians held
Port Arthur the Retvizan would be
valuable as a fortress. She was
jammed on the rocks Just as solidly
as if built there, and was well above
water at high tide. As she lav. her
batteries, had a wide scope, and, al
though seemingly a hopeless wreck, she
was still in a position to give a good
account of herself should the enemy
come within range of her guns. The
Cesarevitch, I understand, had a huge
hole In her bow. I could not see It when
I passed her."
FLEET BOMBARDS FORTS.
The bombardment of Port Arthur by
the guns of the Japanese fleet on 'the
morning of February 9 did little dam
age to property, but its moral effect
could hardly have been greater on the
noncombatants had the Mikado's shells
turned the Manchurian city upside
down. So says C..H. Browning, an of
ficer of the British Royal Artillery,
who arrived yesterday on the liner
Coptic and who was at Port Arthur on
the night the Japanese fleet made the
torpedo attack which opened hostil
ities,, and the following day, during
which the port was bombarded.
Browning was on leave and "just
happened" in Port Arthur 'at the in
teresting moment. Of the torpedo boat
attack he knows nothing from his own
observation, for all night long he slept
soundly on board the British ship
Wenchow. When he reached Port Ar
thur, which he did on the morning of
the attack, he found the hotels crowd
ed. Unable to find, comfortable quar
ters ashore, he accepted the hospital
ity of Wenchow's commander and was
sleeping while the Japanese torpedoes
were busy wrecking Russian .war ves
sels.
Captain J. F. Lea, the British navy
officer who took the cruiser Nisshln
from Genoa to Yokohama for the Ja
panese Government, also was a passen
ger on the Coptic. He is on his way
back to England, where he Is engaged
in farming. Captain Lea was decorat
ed by the Japanese Emperor and
brings with him many presents re
ceived from the people of Japan as part
of their patriotic "thank you" for his
services in safely navigating the Nls
shin from the Old World port at which
she was built. Captain Paynter, who
commanded the Kasuga, the other
cruiser, purchased by Japan from the
Argentine republic, came back on the
Siberia and Is now well on his way to
England.
M. Bechaere, another of the Coptic'*
passengers, was at Port Arthur on
February 10. Bechaere was the repre
sentative in Manchuria of a Belgian
syndicate and was ordered out of the
country shortly before hostilities com
menced. The vessel upon which he
took passage called at Port Arthur and
was detained In the harbor for several
hours. Bechaere saw the sunken Rus
sian ships, but was not ashore and did
not learn until some time later Just
what had occurred at Port Arthur.
Japan, according to Bechaere. Is the
most -peaceful place he ever visited.
Although at war with a mighty foe.

her military strength. Bechaere visit
ed a number of Japanese ports, but not
in one of them, he says, did he see a
single soldier, an army transport or a
war vessel.

thur was especially well prepared for
war. Of that, however. I should not
sp^ak, as it is largely supposition on
my part. Nobody is allowed near the

TOKIO JOURNAL
HEARS THAT PORT
ARTHUR IS TAKEN
"In conclusion I will venture upon
one prophecy, namely, that the result
of this war will be for Russia a bless
ing in disguise. The policy of expan
sion everywhere, "at any cost and any
method, whether of arms or diplomacy,
together with Its upholders, will be dis
credited. The canker at the heart of
Russiaâ the corruption of her beauro
cracy â will be cut out. The statesmen
who desire to curtail military expendi
ture and to encourage Russian produc
tion and commerce will come back to
power. The Czar will push aside oppo
sition to the ideals of humanity and
peace that he cherishes."
NEW TORK, March 21.â Under the
title "The War and After" Henry Nor
man, M. P., discussed the probable
after-effects of the Russo-Japanese war
in the forthcoming number of the
World's Work. He says that it is most
important that one fact should be
clearly realizedâ that "it is. a fight for
the control of China. Korea and Man
churia are subordinate issues. The real
object is predominance in Peking,
bringing with it the ultimate domina
tion of the Far East, and in the future
headship of all the Asiatic lands." He
points out the probability of war in
the Near East, and says:
"Already the flames of hostility to
England are visible almost everywhere
in Europeâ a manifestation which is
not at all surprising in view of the lan
guage of so much of the London press.
From the highest to the lowest modera
tion of language, respect for the feel
ings of other nations and a sense of re
sponsibility appear to have vanished
from many newspapers* Denunciation
of Russia is as' extravagant as lauda
tion of Japan is exaggerated, and is
making England a host of fresh ene
mies every week. For all this a day of
reckoning will surely come, for the pas
sion aroused against England will have
reached Its climax when. If this hap
pens. Russia having evacuated Man
churia, Japan requests the powers to
recognize the retrocession of Manchuria
to China and to decree the end of the
war. Then England is likely to learn
the result of her Asiatic conduct. :>:^:Z
"The next morning at 11 o'clock the
Japanese fleet moved in to within
firing distance and fired shells for
forty-flve minutes. The Pleiades was
behind the spit, but in direct line, and
the shells fell all around us. Our deck
was covered with pieces.
'â¢Â¦ ''Later tne Russians got their
grounded warships off the spit and
inside the harbor, where they now lie
on the bottom, practically submerged.
By working hard, they succeeded in
bringing in a" five-funneled cruiser,
which sank in the harbor the next day.
' "We had great difficulty in getting
away. We were obliged to take 300
Chinese women away with us."
'"They passed through the entrance
to the harbor proper, turned around
and passed out, going up to the other
coast until directly behind the largest
and best of the warships lying outside,
when 'they -turned and fired their tor
pedoes into three of them.
"The remarkable part of it was the
dash of the torpedo-boats through the
100-yard wide mouth of the harbor
and their turning around inside.
"The Russians j fired upon the tor
pedo-boats, but * apparently did no
harm. They' then attempted to get
their warships into the harbor, but
two of the worst disabled ran aground
on the spit and were in a sinking con
dition.
TACOMA, March 21. â A vivid de
scription of the first attack on the
Russian fleet at Port Arthur and the
remarkable dash made into the inner
harbor by the Japanese torpedo-boats
is given in a letter to the Tacotna
News from Allen Fairweather, purser
of the steamship Pleiades of Tacoma,
which had arrived at Port Arthur
with a cargo of flour a few days be
fore the attack was made. He says:
"On Monday night at about 11
o'clock we heard heavy firing, which
continued until .about 2:30 a. m.
Every one thought the forts were en
gaged in some kind of night target
practice, but in the morning, when
we saw two of the largest and best
of the Russian warships aground on
the low spit, we knew that something
more than practice had been going
on. ' .
"It developed that a fleet of Jap
anese torpedo-boats had come along
quitfi close inshore, flying the Russian
flag and giving the Russian signal.
They had passed right under" the
forts along the spit side of the har
bor and had passed by the patrol boat
at the entrance, giving the counter
sign.
TOKIO, March 21. â As a result of the
scries of conferences between the party
leaders, it seems certain that the Gov
ernment will abandon Its attempt to
create a salt monopoly and to place a
tax on silk and will make a smaller in
crease in the land tax than was origi
nally proposed.
The members of the Cabinet are
holding a series of conferences with the
party leaders, who have been explain
ing how the interests of the people
they represent are affected by the war
taxes. The Cabinet is endeavoring to
frame measures which will prove sat
isfactory to the people.
There is a. growing feeling that the
Government should not attempt the
immediate payment of a large part of
the cost of the war by taxation, but
that it should issue bonds and extend
the payments over a series of years.
A, vote of thanks to the navy for 5ts
victories off Port Arthur, which, will be
moved in. the House of Representatives
to-morrow, will praise the valor and
heroism of the officers and men and ex
press the gratitude of the nation.
Prince Pu Lun, the Commissioner of
China to the St. Louis Exposition, who
left Shanghai for Great Britain on his
way to the United States on March 14,

NEW YORK, March 21. â The World
has the following from Tientsin: Ka
taoka, a Japanese merchant here, who
was a Russian spy, has been assassin
ated by being buried alive. The Jap
anese residents show great joy at the
fate of this traitor. The Japanese of
ficials disclaim all knowledge of the
authors of the crime.
American and British residents of
Newchwang, fearing the landing of. a
Japanese force and a conflict, are flee

have spread consternation among the
Chinese, thousands of whom seek
refuge here daily. By the favor of
Viceroy Tuan Shi Kai, 5000 bags of

Special Dispatch to The Call.
JAPANESE TURN
BACK AMERICAN
ARMY ATTACHE
In the first place, wherever possible
frontal attacks on Intrenched positions^
will be avoided, If the Russians, con
trary to the expectations of the Tokio
authorities, determine stubbornly to
contest the passage of the Talu River
the Japanese will not assail the Mus
covite line there, but will simply for
tify and intrench their own position
against an invasion of Korea. Should
the Russians assemble at the Talu in
such numbers as to render the Japan
ese positions untenable the forces thus
ousted will fall back on the line be
tween Pingyang and Wonsan, where
a desperate stand will be made.
As a matter of fact, the Mikado's
generals expect that the enemy not
only will never reach Pingyang In large
numbers, but also that the Russians
will never seriously undertake a cam
paign south of the Talu. They declare
that if the unexpected occur they will
land their forces by sea In the rear of
the Russians, by which means they
hope to give the invaders all the en
tertainment they could possibly desire.
It can be seen from this outline that
the plans of the Islanders for the Ko
rean campaign are primarily defensive.
They will begin their offensive cam
paign elsewhere, possibly at New
chwang or a point farther west, on the
Chinese side of Llao River, or possi
bly on the coast of Korea Bay. They
hope in any case to be able to turn
back the Muscovite forces. They think
it highly probable that they can afford
to push on to Harbin.
LONDON*. March 21.â Military ex
perts in touch with Japanese autho-ri
tative circles predict that Japan's for
ward movement will be in full swing
by the end of this month. They say
that the ice is now leaving the harbors
at all favorable landing points and that
the Mikado's army is eager to get to
work. In a conversation with an ad
viser of the Tokio Government he gave
the following forecast of Japanese ope
rations:

He also expressed the satisfaction

ST. PETERSBURG, March 21.â It
appears that during the bombardment
of the islands in front of Dalny the
Japanese seriously damaged the Red
Cross building. The Russian Govern
ment protests against this as a breach
of civilized methods of warfare.
, One of the highest, officials of the
Foreign Office to-day said:
â¢ "Without any doubt, according to re
ports received, the Japanese have made
use of missiles giving off poisonous
gases. It is not an idle assertion."

The Baron does not believe defeat
will cause a revolution in Japan, but
he says it will result in endless changes
in the Cabinet.
The naval and military authorities,
the Baron said, were fully prepared
and the censorship began to work a
fortnight before the rupture of rela
tions, the censors intercepting all tele
grams between the Russian Govern
ment and its representatives In Japan,
finally, on February 6, stopping the
Russian note transmitted bj^ Viceroy
Alexieff to Baron de Rosen. That
same day the Cabinet held a secret sit
ting, ajid a few minutes after the sit
ting broke up the Japanese squadrons
put to Bea.
If the matter rested solely with the
Cabinet and the Elder Statesmen, said
the Baron to the correspondent, the
conflict would have been avoided, but
the Cabinet, with the object of embar
rassing Parliament, which had refused
to vote supplies, allowed the press to
stir up the Chauvinist spirit until it
got beyond control. Then the Ministry,
finding that it had to choose between
satisfying the Chauvinists and resign
ing, chose the former course, and war
became inevitable, the Mikado and his
counselors being dragged into the pop
ular movement.
PARIS. March 22. â Baron de Rosen,
former Russiaji Minister to Japan, who
arrived to-day at Marseilles, refused to
be Interviewed, but a correspondent of
the Journal who traveled with him from
Port Said telegraphs a summary of nu
merous conversations he had with the
Baron aboard ship. According to this
correspondent, Baron de Rosen said
that since October last the talk of war
had been general In Japan, the Chau
vinist party heating public opinion by
stating that Japan would defeat Russia
as she had defeated China, and would
be certain of the support of Great Brit
ain and the United States. The Mikado
and most of the Eider Statesmen were
opposed to the war, the Baron said,
and Count Inouye said the country
would be ruined, whether victor or
vanquished. Count Matsukata, another
of the Elder Statesmen, expressed the
same view, and Baron Komura, the
Japanese Foreign Minister, advised the
continuance of friendly negotiations,
but the Ministers of "War and Marine
were absolutely determined to fight.
ELDER STATESMEN
OF JAPAN OPPOSED
EECOUESE TO AR3IS
HEAVY cannonading was heard off the western coast of Liaotung Peninsula yesterday
morning, and it was the belief at Newchwang that the Port Arthur fleet had made a dash
out of the harbor to engage Japanese warships guarding transports. Japan, apparently, is at
tempting a landing in force below Yinkow for the investment of Newchwang.
So effective is the Japanese censorship that not in two weeks has definite news of land
movements been permitted to leak out. All of the Japanese forces advancing toward the Yalu:
must have reached the main position north of Pingyang, and the fact that war correspondents
were recalled from the Japanese base some days ago indicated that the time had come for the
advance to the river, where the Russians will make their first stand in force; but since then
the censor has succeeded in suppressing all information relating to the movement. No relmble
news of Japanese land operations in other directions has been received, although it is known
that -transports* have been constantly conveying troops to the groups of islands near the shores
of Liaotung Peninsula, which the Japanese have made their base while massing their forces for
British experts claiming to be conversant with the Japanese plan of campaign say that the
Mikado's generals will avoid direct frontal attacks. Should the Russians desperately contest
the passage of the Yalu, the Japanese will abandon the attempt and assume the defensive on
the Korean frontier. If a Muscovite invasion of Korea be attempted Japan \vill encjeavor to
land an army by sea in .the rear of the invaders. Having the command of the sea, the Japanese
will be enabled to choose the poinb-of least resistance for their land advance.- It is their belief,
however, that the Russians will fall back into the interior of Manchuria, leaving the Mikado's
forces in possession of the southern portion of the province. |
Persistent reports that a battle has been fought on the Korean frontier drift in from vari
ous sources, but they must be taken with reserve. It is asserted in a Seoul dispatch that these
rumors have no foundation, and that, with the exception of a brush of outposts ten days ago,
there has been no land fighting. . Â¦ . . Â¦
Despite China's renewed assurances to Secretary Hay, the attitude of the Peking Govern
ment is causing much uneasiness in Europe. It is feared that China only awaits a favorable op
portunity to take part in the war as an ally of Japan. It is reported that a Chinese squadron,
which has just arrived at Chefu, is to be sent to Newchwang as soon as the breaking of the
ice will permit. Inasmuch as Newchwang is now a fortified Russian stronghold, from which
the great powers have decided to withdraw their naval representation, such an attempt on the
part of the Chinese would be likely to provoke hostilities with Russia. That Russia regards
war with China as altogether probable is apparent from the fact that nearly one-third of Kuro
patkin's great army is so disposed as to protect the Manchurian frontier against an invasion by
Chinese regulars.
ST. PETERSBURG^ March 21.â The ,
following official dispatch, dated Muk
den. March 20, was received to-day:
"General Zilineky reports as follows:
The tmops are in good spirits and there
is no sickness. According to reports re
ceived from the frontier guards on the
t:ast*>rn Chinese Railway everything is
in order there. At Udyeni station Cap
tain Uksemoff, with seventy cavalry
men, has driven off a band of 100 Chi
nese bandits.
"The occupation of the towns of Anju
and Pingyang by the enemy's infantry
ar.d artillery Is confirmed. An Increased
movement of troops and transports on
the road between Pingyang and Anju
is noticeable. Thirteen of the enemy's
transports recently unloaded at Che
mulpo.
"According to reports there have been
no preparations for a landing near
Kinchow. All reports appearing in for
eign newspapers of the landing of Japa
nese troops at different points on the
roast are inventions."
Official advices report the concentra
tion of armed Mongolians disguised as
pilgrims at Vankuren, south of Lake
Baikal and a few miles from the Rus
sian frontier.
Captain William V. Judson, United
States military attache to the embassy
here, has arrived and will proceed to
the front as soon as possible to observe
the military operations for his Govern
ment.
In Government circles there exists a
strong belief that whether China will
observe her neutrality understandings
v.ill depend largely upon the result of
the first heavy land fighting. A big
victory by the Russian army. It Is be
lieved, will insure the acquiescence of
lhe celestial empire, but there are
crave fears as to what might occur in
the event of a signal Japanese success
in the early stages of the land opera
tic ns.
For th? time being the situation ap
j ".irs to be satisfactory, and it is cer
tainly much better than it was three
MÂ«?eks ago. The natives manifest a
iiirndlier disposition than they did at
Â«h<^ beginning of the war; but the Rus
-,.:ns know the Oriental character as
no other Europeans do. They know
liow deep seated is the hatred of for
< ipners In China and that the only
;ir*>stijre of the Russians is their strong
arm.
The recent naval success of the Jap
anese has not greatly impressed the
Chinese, but if the Russians should
sustain a really disastrous defeat on
land the Chinese might suddenly be
iirouffd, with the connivance or even
with the consent of Japan,* against
Itussia and. perhaps, against all for
â¢ â¢igners.
Russia's present plans are based on
the appreciation of the supreme im
7'"rtanr-c of the first land battle, and
no fighting on a large scale will take
' j'lace. if it possibly can be averted,
until the Russians feel morally certain
that they can deal the enemy a crush
ing blow.
General Zilinsky's official confirma
tion of the reports that the Russian
outposts abandoned Anjii on the ap
rroach of the Japanese in force causes
no surprise here, as such action is in
perfect accord with the Russian plan of
campaign. The Russian skirmishing
and advanced outposts, thrown forward
solely for the purpose of harassing and
worrying the Japanese'outposts, will fall
hack as the main body of the enemy
moves forward until the strong posi
tions at the Yalu River are reached.
The fifty miles of country between
Anju and the Talu is very difficult for
the movement of a large force. There
may be some lively skirmishing: as the
Japanese advance progresses, but the
Russians are resolved to avoid a deci
sive engagement until certain of vic
tory.
Simultaneously the fleet bombarded the
town and harbor. The action began at
6 o'clock on the evening of March 19
and continued until 10 o'clock on the
morning of March 20. Sixteen ships
were engaged in the attack, and the re
sult Is reported to have been the occu
pation of Port Arthur by the Japanese.
No further details are given and the
report remains bo far unconfirmed.

ST. PETERSBURG. March 21. â
The Empress is serulingr an Easter gift
to every Russian soldier in Manchuria.
These presents will be personal -with
her and distinct from anything that
may be bought for the troops with
funds raised by public subscription
and under her control. The Czarina
will give tD each soldier a small ham
per containing, besides food, delica
cies, cigarettes and small camp neces
saries. Her Majesty has been known
to the troops as "the little mother"
and by this act of kindness she has
fully justified the endearing title.
Czarina's Gifts to Soldiers.
The piece. abounds in striking situa
tions, hairbreadth escapes and mar
velous rescues. The most stupendous
thing iii it is where the conspirators
kidnap the heroine and take her sky
ward in a dirigible balloon, from the
car of which she is thrown in order
that she may be dashed to pieces on
the earth below. Miraculously the
girl lights on a church steeple and
clings to the cross and she is released
from that perilous position and saved
by the King of Detectives, who has
followed the villains in a balloon of
his own. The scenic effect of the bal
loons Â¦ racing above the clouds was
strikingly realistic and was followed
by thunderous applause.
Herschel Mayall portrayed the king
and richly earned all the applause he
got, for the role kept him working at
high tension, with lightning changes
every few minutes throughout the
play. Elmer Booth made a humorous
hit as a gentleman tramp, who be
comes a member of the Salvation
Army through his love for a blue
bonneted soldieress, a part in which
Myrtle Vane was the real thing. Â¦ ;
MisB Lawton, as the heroine, filled
the bill admirably, while Edna Ells
mere, who made her first appearance
at the Central in the part of Olga, the
adventuress, proved herself to be a
clever actress, possessing grace and
beauty as well as ability. Henry Shu
mer shone as a prince of villains and
kept the king on the Jump all the
time, while a fine bit of Hebrew char
acter acting was done by Ernest How
ell. The balance of the cast Is in good
hands.
For thrilling sensation and spectac
ular scenic effects the Central Theater
reached the limit last night in Theo
dore Kremer's melodramatic master
piece, "The King of Detectives." The
king appearÂ»-in a dozen different dis
guises, with a different kind of voice
for every disguisej and he enacts won
ders enough to put such rivals as Old
Sleuth and Sherlock Holmes out of
business. ' The play is a top-notcher
for the Central and a packed house
greatly enjoyed the climaxes.

Henry A. Wolter, a laborer, aged
66 years, was accidentally suffocated
by inhaling illuminating gas last Sun
day night at his lodgings, 2828 Twen
ty-fourth street. He retired very much
under the influence of liquor at 11
o'clock in the evening and his dead
body attired only in his undercloth

from a partly open burner. The door
was closed, but not locked and the
window was open three inches from
the top.
About a month ago Wolter went to
bed one night under the influence of
liquor and shortly after the odor of
gas was traced to his room and he was
found unconscious, he having care
lessly turned the gas key open after
having shut off the supply. Mqdical
aid was summoned and he was resus
citated. On the last occasion, how
ever, Wolter had been dead several
hours when discovered.

(he scene painter's art is this somber
ly-rich apartment that is shcum.
Throughout, the pictures are of the
utmost magnificence, and play no light
part in the powerful atmosphere of the
drama.' The second scene is in the
palaco of AuIuh Flavius, to which Mary
has g-one to see the Christ and disciples
in the adjoining garden. A nobly beau
tiful picture this, rich, harmonious and
with a marvelous suggestion of solidity.
There is a street scene in Jerusalem
next, with, a finely picturesque crowd
and some lovely perspectives. All told,
we are unlikely to get again such stage
pictures for some time â and the light
ing of them must not be forgotten.
But all this is but the setting. There
is Mrs. Fiske at the heart of it all, a
worthy central gem, and she brings
others to the task of interpretation
that are worthy her company. Mrs.
Fiske's Mary is most potently convinc
ing. It is the courtesan we see in the
first act, luxurious, willful, but already
a-weary. She has begun to find life
ashes on her tongue. There Is a con
centrated bitterness of mood that
reaches the terrible here, as she doubts
love, friendship, everything to Fla
vius' younger ears. Her finale, as she
hears from Judas of the Nazarehe and
measures her attraction against his di
vine resistance, is a marvelous bit of
suggestion. The next act finds her in
Flavius' garden, curiously attracted to
-the Nazarine and his disciples. Her
opportunity here is in a Jittle scene
with Caiaphas, where the priest would
have her tempt Flavius to give over
Christ into his hands. She. is here the
incarnation of scorn, its quiet flame
seething over the footlights. Thla' is
the" supreme climax of the play. Here
Flavius. who really loves her, offers to
save Chrisj>from Pilate (the uncle of
Flavius) if Â«he will be his mistress.
Redeemed, Mary shrinks with utter
horror from the suggestion, but con
templates the sacrifice. Her struggle â
enhanced subtly, in its values, by the
charm of Mr. Gilmore's Aulus Flavius
â Is a piteous and superb spectacle.
Voice, gesture, face, all lend themselves
with brilliant sympathy to the picture.
Throughout Mrs. Fiske's Mary is su
perbly Intellectual, shaded with su
preme artâ here it becomes most pite
ous satire.
As before said, Mr. Gilmore's Flavius
!3 excellent. He is graceful, reads his
lines with- fine intelligence, and acts
with charm and finish. The Judas of
the cast is unfortunate. Mr.' Bosworth,
who assumes the part, Is melodramatic,
theatric, and with a curiously unintelli
gent fashion of diction. Only once, in
his final scene with Mary, does he get
at the heart of the character, or arouse
the sympathy that the dramatist has
given ample opportunity for arousing.
Caiaphas is excellently handled by Max
Figman, and the rest of the roles are
all adequately taken.
BLANCHE PARTINGTON.
SCENE FROM PLAY BEIXG PRO
DUCED BY MRS. FISKE AT
TUP GRAND.
Most interesting of Mr. Heyse's
changes in the biblical story is hjs
ascription of political motives to Ju
das for his betrayal of the Master.
Or rather, It is to .Mr. Winter that thV
insistence on this motive must be as
cribed. The German is yet. more rad
ical. Jealousy of the Christ, for the
worship of Mary Magdalen, whom
Judas : loves and who . has . loved him,
is the leading- motive" in the original
play for Judas'- sin. Mary herself is
made the wife of; a' -vile and
cruel Hebrew, from whom she
has at length .fled in despair
ilo her life of shame. The first
{ act shows her in her palace in Jeru
Â¦ salem and a magnificent specimen of
Clothed in potent verse, acted with
moving sincerity and power, the story
of the Magdalen was last night retold
by Mrs. Fiske and her company of
players, in Paul Heyse's noble drama,
"Mary of Magdala," the place being
the Grand Opera-house. The audience
. was worthy of the play. Despite Lent
â perhaps though, the theme consid
ered, because of it â the house was
large, and the usual Fiske house. There
were there those to whom the drama is
more than the toy of the hour, those
for whom it is of the nobler arts, those
; for whom it is the very pulse and tem
per of their day. For these, "Mary of
Magdala" has a high significance, and
to theseâ nay, for all there last night
there was in the chief interpreter an
exalted thrill of passion, a magnifi
cence of emotional artistry, that places
Mrs. Fiake rungs higher than even she
has before reached, that sets her'
Mary of Magdala with those other
passional epics, the Phedre of Bern
: hardt, the Santuzza of Calve, with a
[ larger wonder of passion purely spir
1 itualized. â¢ Â¦
| Not until the fourth act does one
! get hold of this deeper woman, but
! the preceding acts are then seen to
I have been most vitally significant of
i her growth. Nor until the fourth act
: last night did Mrs. Fiske seem fully to
j be herself. Then it was that the tense
j voice, in the preceding acts hardly of'
S the measure of the house, came clear
â¢ cut and thrilling. Then, too â well, one's
j neighbor's wife was not the only one
; who swallowed things. Men choked
1 down something very like .a sob as the
I little woman in front 1 wept the Mag
, dalen's bitter shame. And the curtain
j went down on a house that kept rever
i ent hands as still almost as in church.
! Briefly, baldly, the German drama
tist's work is stupendous in scope, com
j polling in effect and nobly impressive
I In spectacle. Mr. Heyse tells his storyâ
; cr stories rather, there are twoâ In five
| actg. The form is blapk verse, that has
j been translated with keen poetic sym
; pathy by that most graceful writer and
j able critic,^ William Winter. Naturally,
it is first id wonder how much and
what of his sacred material the drama
tist has used. As the title implies, the
play is about the Magdalen, whose re
generation is its obvious theme. But
more powerful even in' its enthralling
suggestion Is that unseen drama, inex
tricably interwoven with the first, of the
betrayal and crucifixion of the Christ.
Through the veins of the first this runs
like a stupendous leit-motif. With the
same haunting impressiveness as in the
little "Passion Play" at Santa Clara,
i one feels the overshadowing presence
of the Christ, with the same uplift and
ennoblement of illusion.
Of the visible characters the chief
three are drawn directly from the
Scripturesâ Mary, Judas and Caiphas.
The rest, of whom Aulus Flavlus, a
noble Roman in lpve with Mary, i&
chief, are all imaginary. The incident,
too, of the drama Is largely invention,
and felicitous, indeed, is Mr. Heyse's
mingling of fact and fancy. Dramat
ically his story possesses all the re
quirements of interest. The conflict of
emotion is of . the ' strongest possible
kind, the>plot is t>f the clearest, the
characters are drawn with utmost skill
and massed brilliantly, and the diction
is dignified and poetic.
The choruses particularly favor the
voices in the Tivoli company. There
are . no great difficulties to overcome;
the range is moderate and the tunes
have a pleasant jingle and swing to
them. The chc-rus this year is above
the average. It was used effectively
and never once ran away from the
baton.
In. the last act Annie Myers fell and
was/hurt so that after a dance she
limped to her position at one end of
the stage and there nursed a sprained
ankle. She will not be incapacitated,
however.
Arthur Cunningham was cast as
Tony Weller and Ferris Hartman was
Sam Weller. Hartman had compara
tively little to do. Cunningham's voice
came ou^ strongly in a solo. George
Chapman as Winkle had a very good
song that he went through with ac
ceptably. Nettle Deglow, whose star
at the Tivoli would seem to be con
stantly rising, has a small part, but
filled that well. All the company were
in evidence. Aimee as Rachel
Wardle, Bessie Tannehill as Mrs. Bar
dell and Schusfer as Wardle.
There was nothing the matter with
the stage setting. The first scene was
goc-d enough to call for approval from
the audience on its merits. In the sec
ond" act there is a rainbow scene in
which parasols and dresses, with the
aid of colored lights, repeat the pris
matic colors in inverse order,' helping
to make a pretty effect. People who
did not attend are assured that Ferris'
Hartman, Wallace Brownlow as Jingle
and Arthur Cunningham made great
havoc wifh the English inflection of
their spoken words, but the effort was
evidently too great for Teddy Webb
and he refrained.
initial performance was centered par
ticularly upon the newcomer, Dora de
Filippe. . Her first scng proved that
she has a voice that is very sweet, of
good quality throughout, the register
that; the' score called for in her role and
that she has: Style and Is chic. She
altogether filled her part, more than
acceptably. : Her. high notes are partic
ularly limpid .\,apd pleasing. . In the
laughing song with Teddy Webb and
Annie Myers she won her share of the
applause that followed. "Mr. Pick
wick" has. a'dearth of so-loa, but the
new singer had at least one good op
portunity to display her vbice. That
was sufficient to give her an imme
diate hold on the favor of the audience.
The motion made by the defendant's
attorney on Friday for a commission to
take the testimony of Dr. A. H. Gar
nett of Colorado Springs, Colo., the de
fendant's brother, was granted bv the
Judge. T>r. Garnett had informed the
attorney that he would willingly an
swer any questions' put to him.
During the attorney's remarks in
support of the motion he said that a
plea of insanity would be made for
the defendant and it was in corrobora
tion of that plea that he desired the
testimony of Dr. Garnett.
Nothing was said regarding the ap
pointment of a commission to take the
testimony of Mrs. Colt, who Is said to
be in Paris, France.
The trial of Alexander B. Garnett
for the murder of Major J. W. Mc-
Clung in the rooms of Mrs. Elizabeth
Hitchcock-Coit at the Palace Hotel
on November 25 was to have com
menced before a jury in Judge Law
lor's court yesterday, but at the re
quest of defendant's attorney a con
tinuance was granted till April 6.

"The explanation of the fact is that
boys are allowed to run wild; are not
given the same close guardianship that
is given to girls. Should they be
Â¦watched more carefully and kept at
home more than they are there would
be far less vice in the world than there
is. for as they grow older thev would
continue the good habits taught them
In their infancy."
At the conclusion of the address
light refreshments were served.
The speaker, who is one of the fore
most members of the temperance
union, gave an interesting talk on the
subject of "Morale" and explained
why boys as a rule are less rigid than
irirls in their distinction between right
and wrong morally. Miss Hollister
said:

But the most convincing bit of work
done by the actress is in the third act,
where she is wooed by the prince.
Flashes of the woman who appreciates
the dignity of her wifehood gleam
through the artlessness of the Ameri
can girl unacquainted with the awry
morality of high-grade European soci
ety. 'When the titled roue attempts to
belittle the affection of her
spouse she Indignantly repels the innu
endo 'and informs him that American
manhood is beyond the ken of his kind.
In that moment there was a flash -of
art that made Miss Manneringjs Flavia
such a respect-compelling . personality
in "The Prisoner of Zenda."
It Is a 'well-balanced company " that
accompanies the star. Arthur Byron
renewed his grip upon the' favoritism
of the Columbia clientele by his por
trayal of the typical New York man of
affairs that could combjne business
with conjugal felicity, and Thomas A.
Wise made the pompous Police Inspec
tor Bock a' memorable comedy figure.
As the head waiter at the spa hotel,
Edward See was happy. Emma Jan
vier, as the American journalist
abroad, earned a fair share of credit
for her careful handling of an ungrate
ful part, and as the amorous prince,
Louis Massen was entirely artistic.
The piece is very nicely staged, each
of the three scenes being a realistic
picture,
worked out. By the folk at the spa
the husband is mistaken for the
prince, the prince for the husband and
the bride for the lady of the opera.
These folk, by the way, are variegated
and faithfully drawn, even to a New
York newspaper woman who la* scour-
Ing the Continent for scandals.
In the first i act Miss Mannering is
deliciously inconsistent as the petted
and pettish bride who fails to under
stand why her helpmeet cannot at
tend to her whims and caprices to the
exclusion of everything and everybody
else. She rails at him for thinking of
his Wall-street business " while she is
nigh, and he ingenuously asks her if. she
likes a good time. "Oh, yes; you know
l'do,".is.her rapturous. response. "Well,
it takes money to make a good time,"
is his practical response. But even then
she fails tb understand why life should
not be all. kisses.
"I did not experience excitement and
except that my tooth began to ache
there was a strange sensation of con
tentment the scenes of death,
which had no terrors after the first
shell had exploded. Suddenly a white
faced gunner pointed to a battery of
quick-firing guns half way down the
hill, which had been placed there to
prevent a Japanese landinsr. I ran
down and found the scene of the wild
est. There was a battle orgy of burst
ing shells and whistling fragments, the
smoke stench reeking the earth.
"One shell had burst among the gun
ners. A soldier was lylns disembow
eled and another had his skull crushed.
A third soldier was delirious and there
were splinters in his head. One gun
had been broken like a reed. It was a
dreadful sight, â¢with blood everywhere. **
In concluding, the officer says:
"After the battle was over Lieuten
ant General Stoessel, commander at
Port Arthur, pinned the cross of St.
George on my breast. But 'what does
it matter â I am In the hospital T*
(The foregoing probably refers to the
first bombardment of Port Arthur, as
the narrative says the Russians had
twelve ships In action.)
"What followed Is almost indescrib
able. The sea underneath where we
stood fairly boiled with the swish and
plunge of projectiles .and words of
command were inaudible to the gun
ners. I tried in vain to shout my
orders, while 150 guns belched In a
prolonged roar and shells were burst
ing overhead with a hellish crash.
The smoke and dust blinded us.
ST. PETERSBURG, March 21.â A
Russian officer commanding a battery
on Electric Hill during a bombardment
of Port Arthur has written the follow
ing vivid account:
"It was a clear, sunlit day, and there
was a gentle swell on the water. A
little spot appeared through the haze
on the far horizon, and then another
and another, until these spots were in
creased to fifteen. Nearer and nearer
they came, and larger and larger they
appeared, until, when six miles off,
there was a tiny puff of smoke and all
in the battery wondered where the pro
jectiles were going to fall.
"Forty fathoms below the cliff where
we were lay the battleship Peresviet.
Bang! A shell burst under her bows,
splashing the docks with spray. An
other puff followed, and a projectile
whistled overhead, crashing on the rock
behind us. Then a third. It was a
moment of terrible suspense. There
was a terrific explosion overhead. They
had got our range exactly.
"It was the signal for us to open
fire, and ten shore batteries and
twelve warships joined in the reply.

She supplemented her remarks by a

The lecture was illustrated by a col

a constant stream of fashlonab!y
dressed women with their male escorts
in evening. dress poured into the hotel,
at the big entrance of which a cordon
of police was busily engaged keeping
the way clear of a curious crowd that
swarmed about the building, eagerly
seeking a view of the . brilliant scene
within. As theater time approached
the gathering somewhat diminished,

its .business career in a most brilliant
manner. - Â¦ Invitations had been issued
to several thousand people by the man

weather, those who were fortunate
enough â¢ to receive these invitations
made it. part of their evening's, pro

view its elegant fittings, than which

to the 'guests was preceded by a din

tables in both the main dining-room
and the handsome grillroom adjoining.
Even then the hotel service was almost

BAN DIEGO, March 21.â At the regu
lar meeting of the City Council to
night the Finance Committee reported
that in pursuance of the resolution and
an order of the Council the City Clerk
has ! received subscriptions from local
Investors for the $150,000 of the bonds
offered to the public. The amount
subscribed, on which 5 per cent had
been put np, was 5117,000, in 'lots of
from $20,000 down to $500. The Council
ratified all of the sales and the bonds
will be ready . to-morrow at the office of
the City Treasurer.
There are other city bonds ready for
issue, but they are not to be sold at
the present time because the present
sale will give to the city all that is
needed, and by waiting until the rest of
the money is needed the city can save
interest. The Board of Works was di
rected, to advertise monthly and let a
contract for iron pipe.
; A letter 1 was received this evening
from W. S. Melick of the State Board
of Examiners offering to take $50,000 of
the water bonds' for the State if the le
gality of the Issue is sustained by the
Attorney General. The offer will doubt
less be accepted, as the official red tape
will be unwound about the time that
the city is ready to sell more bonds.
Special Dispatch to The Call
Crudo will be sentenced on April 2.
The crime for which Crudo must pay
the penalty was one of the most cold
blooded murders of the year. He was
not arrested till two days after the
killing had taken place. His nephew
was first placed under arrest and de
nied any knowledge of the crime. Cru
de was later arrested and confessed
to having killed Migale, claiming that
he had done so in self-defense.
Crudo and Migale quarreled over
money matters in a saloon on Duporit
street. Crudo left the saloon and al
leged In his defense that he was fol
lowed by Migale, who attempted to
stab him.
The defense put up by Crudo was
Â¦weak. Much difficulty was experienced
by the prosecution in securing the tes
timony of witnesses in the case. Per
jury 'was hinted at and had not Crudo
been found guilty some of the wit
nesses would probably have been ar
rested.
Nicolo Crudp, tried before Superior
Judge Lawlor for shooting and killing
his fellow countryman, Prospero Mi
gale, at the corner of Green and Kearny
streets on November 8, 1903, was found
guilty of murder in the first degree last

minutes and returned the verdict
stated, with a recommendation that

The opening session of the conference
this morning was devoted to a discus
sion of "The Present Situation," by the
Rev. S.C Gale, pastor of the Chester
street Methodist Episcopal Church, and
a talk on "Present Needs and Condi
tions," by the Rev. J. P. Gerrior, Pres
byterian synodlcal missionary. The

than fifty boys and girls trooped into
the church and listened to a very inter
esting discourse on the text, "Prepare
to Meet Thy God." Mr. Halliday made
his meaning so plain to the young folks
that they could not fall to understand
him, and many of the children seemed
to grasp the significance of the sermon
and left the church with serious faces.

The will was admitted to probate by
Judge Greene, and the Union ; Trust
Company of San Francisco was ap
pointed executor without bonds. Rice
has employed J. J. Lermen of San
Francisco to fight the matter in his be
half, and as the case now stands a con
test over the estate is Inevitable, as
the other heirs have evidently come to
an understanding and left Rice out.
Mrs. Canning's estate shortly before
her death was supposed to be worth
considerably more than $225,000. She
had given large sums to the cbarch and
her advisers, and gave Mrs. Michael
Davitt a Christmas present of $30,000.
Notwithstanding a compromise effect
ed between Archbishop RIordan, Mrs.
Mi chanel Davit t and her brothers, W.
J. and John M. Yore, as to the division
of the estate left by the late Mary
Canning, there is to be a contest over
the probating of the will, as this com
promise leaves out of consideration
Michael Rice, another nephew of the
deceased, with legal rights equal to
those of Mrs. Davltt and her brothers.
Attorney Garret McEnerney present
ed the will to-day for probate. It had
been held in abeyance for the last six
weeks until an agreement could be
reached among the heirs. Rice was
not included in the agreement. He lives
in Arizona and came on here to look
out for his interest in the estate of his
aunt. The will leaves the remnant of
the estate, consisting of cash to the
amount of $78,000. to Archbishop Rior
dan and Mrs. Michael Davitt in equal
shares.

The AmsocUted Charities will render to the
Board of Supervisors a written report giving
the facts in each case and the deductions
therefrom, the final decision to rest with the
board.
The Associated Charities has made a
proposition to take charge of the Indi
gent relief work of the Board of Super
visors in Districts 3, 4 and 5,' represent
ed by Supervisors Kelley,. Rowe and
Mitchell, and including Oakland, Berke
ley and most of Alameda. The organi
zation . purposes . to investigate the
claims of all applicants for relief and to'
report to the board upon all cases. To
cover the cost of inquiry the Asso
ciated Charities calls for a monthly fee
Of $100. '- ' ";i
In their communication the commit
tee eliminates Supervisorial Districts 1
and 2 because they are country dis
tricts.
A large percentage of the heavy ap
propriations for indigent relief Is used
in the city of Oakland. It is the pur
pose of the Associated Charities to
utilize its system in the work and to
cut down if possible the expenditures
in this field. The committee's letter is
as follows:
The Associated Charities, by the nature of
it* work, comes into close touch with many
of the poor of Oakland.
All cases eomlntr under its notice are care
fully investigated and' a complete record is
placed on flle in its office.

The motion for a nonsuit^ was made
to-day immediately after the reading of
a number of letters written in affection
ate terms by Mrs. Barrie to her nephew,
Fred Wade, extending over a period of
time when she alleges Wade was in
league with her husband to disrupt her
family, these letters being a direct con
tradiction of her testimony. Barrie, the
husband, did not wish the motion for a
nonsXiit to be pressed, as he wished to
put In testimony to refute the charges
of attempted poisoning, Immorality and
ylce<rriade against him and his family.
Attorney Lin Church made a statement
to this effect to the court, but said he
deemed it his duty to his client to take
the advantage the law gave him.-;..
Mrs. Eliza Barrie was denied a di
vorce to-day by Judge Ogden because
he said he believed she was insane and
that her charges were fabrications and
the product of a disordered Imagina
tion; that letters she wrote some time
ago positively refute the testimony she
had given on the stand in the last few
days. The Judge granted a motion for
nonsuit without any testimony being
put in to controvert the heinous charges
made by Mrs. Barrie against her hus
band and members of his family.
l In regard to the case Judge Ogden
said afterward: "This is one of the
most peculiar cases that has ever come
before me." From my observation and
what I have learned of Insane people
as an Insanity Commissioner I believe
this to be a good example of a person
suffering from neurosis. With such
people their affliction turns them
against truth and those nearest and
dearest to them. In this case a woman
has turned against her husband, who
had done everything for her. and ac
cording to her own testimony she had
no prejudice against him until he took
her to an asylum, and yet prior to that
time she has charged him with immor
ality of every description. While she
seemingly told a straight story and re
members dates and circumstances, an
analysis of her testimony shows it .to
be a fabrication, although I believe the
woman thinks what she is telling is the
truth."

and settle as to the items. Howard
withdrew a resolution he introduced
directing the City Attorney to draw, a
stipulation to dismiss the water rates
suit. It was explained that during Mr.
Howard's absence the Council had
voted to, continue the appeal in the
case.*
.Councilman Cuvelller Introduced in
the City Council to-rilght p. provisional
water rates ordinance for 1904-05 mak
ing a r horizontal cut of 10 per cent to
Individual rate-payers in the water
rates now In force/municipal rates to
remain as at present.
Â¦ The Councilman explained that he
wanted the bill referred to the com
mittee of the whole to rest there until
it was determined whether the proposed
board of arbitration on the value of
the Contra .Costa Water Company's
plant should be able to report in time
for the Council to use the figures for
rate-fixing purposes. Cuvellier said he
had of his own volition gone to William
J. Dlngee, president of the water com
pany, to discuss the matter and Dingee
had given^ a verbal pledge that if the
City Council would accept a 10 per cent
cut the "company would not contest,
but that If a heavier cut should b^
made the company would go into the
United States 'courts and litigate all
this, provided the arbitration plan was
not completed.
Councilmen Meese, Howard, Pendlc
ton and Elliott spoke against the In
troduction of the Cuvellier ordinance
at this time, arguing that it was pre
mature. By consent the ordinance
went without reading to the committee.
Councilman Howard, in explanation of
the status of the board of arbitration,
said that a representative for the city
had been selected and was ready to gd
to work as soon as he was summoned.
Howard believed that within ten days
the water company would be ready to
name its engineer and that the report
of the board could be rendered In thirty
days after the third man had been
selected.

band Are Fabrications of

TELLS OF ITS PURPOSE
The resolution was signed by W. H.
Hopkins, R. H. Elliott, W. H. Boynton,
W. R. Jewell. R. P. Newcomb and B.
S. Xorton, the sophomore class com
mittee, and W. C. Davis, W. J. Hanna,
J. J. Crow. L. H. Cromwell, S. J. Hume
and Charleg L. Haley. These adopted
the resolutions this morning after they
had been addressed by the seniors, who
admonished them' that the faculty
Â¦would expel any man engaging in a
rush.
During the discussion on this resolu
tion in the class meeting it developed
that the belligerents wanted any kind
of a rush that could be had without
endangering their scalps. Some sug
gested that the freshmen, instead of
p-oing upon Charter Hill, go- upon Griz
zly Peak and dare the "sophies" to.
follow. In case this scheme is carried
out there will certainly be something
to settle with the faculty, and the end
ie not yet.
"Whereas, the faculty of the Univer
llty of California has taken active steps
to prohibit a rush on Charter day even
ing and the senior and Junior classes
have upheld them In their action, be
lieving it to be for the best interest of
the University; be it
"Resolved, That we, the undersigned
committees, representing tlie two un
der classes to consider the advisability
of having no Charter day rush this
year, do hereby make this decision, pro
vided the freshmen class pledges itself
to sustain its committee: We pledge
ocrselves that neither class go upon
Charter Hill on the evening of Charter
day, 1904."
When the recommendation came up
for a vote the second time the parti
fans were more evenly divided, but to
avoid a second defeat the so-called
"programmers" forcibly threw a lot of
the "rough house" element to their
â¢ide, in this way carrying the day. The
recommendation finally, adopted reads:
The rule of might figured largely in
the decision. In the first place the
freshmen voted down a proposal to in
dorse the recommendation of the class
<-Â«jmmittee that there be no rush. This
vote laid bare the fact that there is a
belligerent spirit in the class, at least
three-fourths being in f^nor of the
! <~>ugh house.
The 75 per cent vote against the
adoption of peace measures for Char
ter day ought to have been enough to
have settled the committee's recom
mendation forever, but it didn't. By
some inexplicable method of reasoning
the presiding officer and class presi
dent, W. C. Davis, ruled that the vote
vas all wrong and in the midst of the
disturbance It was decided to try it all
over again.
Out of a potpourri of bad parliamen
tary rulings, motions and re solutions
at the meeting <jt the freshmen class
ct the University of Calirornia this aft
ernoon came a decision that the class
not 'rush against the sophomores
on Charter day. which falls on Wed
r^Bday. This decision was not evolved
strictly according to Hoyle, but it was
achieved after a fashion and it will
serve its purpose.

Because the administration of the

the Department of Commerce and La
bor, it has been necessary for Secre
tary Hay to call upon Secretary Cor
telyou to assist in the formation of the
new treaty. Secretary Cortelyou will
deal with those sections of the treaty
which practically prescribe the regu
lations that shall govern the admission
of Chinese of the higher class and the
exclusion -of coolies. Secretary Hay
will take care of the diplomatic sec
tions of the treaty. While much reti
cence is' observed at present as to the
lines upon which the new convention
is being formed, there Is reason to
believe that it will be more liberal In
treatment of Chinese who desire to en
ter the United States, when they are
not actually of the coolis class, than
the existing treaty. There also may
be. made provisions for the entry of
Chinese laborers into the Panama
canal strip, though this is not certain.
An attempt also has been made to

Mr. Grant then became a partner in
the old house of Eugene Kelly & Co.,
and remained there until 1S62, when the
Donohoe-Kelly Banking Company was
formed and the dry goods business
turned over to the * newly organized
partnership of Murphy, Grant & Co..
consisting of D. T. Murphy, who after
ward made his headquarters in New
York; Adam Grant, John Deane and :
Thomas Breeze. All these familiar fig
ures in San Francisco business life
have now joined the majority. I
The house was incorporated several j
years ago. with Mr. Grant as president j
and principal shareholder. Its business j
has for many years made it one of the |
most important establishments on the j
Pacific Coast. Mr. Grant will be sue- i
ceeded in the management of the cor
poration's interests by his only son, Jo

At the time of his death Mr. Grant

Banking Company and a director in the
Bank of California and the Security !

ested in real estate and held stock in
the Geary Street Railway Company
and other corporations. IVIr. Grant was
also an honorary member of the Scot

to throw over his mining schemes and

he was all his life a master. When

youthful merchant caught the fever

his party, while crossing the isthmus
on mules, were attacked and narrowly
escaped with their lives.

There are questions, however,- which the bill of Cap
tain Daniels does not settle. The boundary between the
United States and Mexico, fixed by the treaty of Guada
lupe Hidalgo, was indefinite from where it left the Rio
Grande near Rincon and followed the Gila to its conflu
ence with the Colorado. To rectify the line and make it
definite, the United States sent General Gadsden of
;North Carolina to make a new. boundary treaty with
'Santa Anna, who was the President of Mexico, in 1853.
The result was; what is known as "the Gadsden pur
chase," by which we acquired for the sum of $16,000,000
an amorphous i-iece of land that, zigs and zags all . the
way from El Paso to Yuma and thence follows the ori
ginal line to the Pacific Ocean. â¢ ' Â¦Â¦[']Â¦

Sandwiched in with all the legisla
tion that is done this year is a great
deal of politics. The Congressional
Record Is called upon to do mission
ary work for both parties with its
every day's Issue. In the House ths
routine of business is relieved by fre
quent speeches of a purely political
character and the names of prominent
men and candidates are often ap
plauded when named. Even Cleve
land, who has been openly repudiated
by Democrats on the floor of both
houses, Rot a' cheer when' eulogized
by Mr. Patterson of Tennessee re
eently. But the demonstration that
followed the enthusiastic reference to
Speaker Cannon by William Alden
Smith as a possible some time Presi
dent provoked an ovation that leaped
from the floor to the galleries and last
ed several minutes despite the Speak
er's labor with his gavel. The refer
ence came durmgrthe heated discus
sion of Mr. Bristow's famous postof
fice report and the opportunity, so tak
en advantage of no doubt relieved a
pood many overwrought feelings, as
well as testified to the popularity of
the Speaker. The story is printed here
that just about the same time that
Mr. Cannon .was receiving this Presi
dential nomination by so representa
tive a body as the lower house of
Congress his county convention at
home was indorsing Mr. Roosevelt.
And this indorsement was forwarded
at once to the Speaker, who transmit

The little room where sits the Su
preme Court formerly, from 1800 to
1S59, was the United States Senate
chamber. Here sat Thomas Jefferson
Â£s the presiding officer in 1800 and
John C, Calhoun in 1S59. Here fig
ured Webster. Chase, Stephen A.
Douglas, Ben Wade and a long line
of distinguished men. It was In this
room that Preston Brooks assaulted
Charles Sumner. Here the Louisiana
purchase was determined. There is
a bill in Congress now for the con
struction of a splendid building for the
Supreme Court in the Capitol grounds,
but so there has been in almost every
Congress for many years. The bill
cannot muster strength to get
through. Though the approach to the
â¢ ourtroom is not imposing- the room
itself is deemed adequate and its as
sociations hallow it Besides, it is
very convenient for the lawyers in
Fenate and Houce, who frequently
drop in to argue a case or to listen.
The opinion itself followed these and
then the dissenting opinions as quick
ly as they could be had for transmis
sion. Justice Harlan's opinion con
tained .24,000 words and the v.-hole story
with interviews as sent in some in
stances contained 20,000 words. The
proceedings of Congress and all other
matter was sidetracked for the time
being. No eueh test of capacity had
been applied to the telegraph wires In
AVashlngton for a long time. The
mountain of words, however, was
licked up in good time and other rou
tine handled as well. Among- the news
paper men there was little time for
talk during the day, but the next morn
ing in the press galleries It was the
pride and boast of every man that had
had anything to do with it that his
paper had sot to the street several
easy minutes !n advance of all of its
competitors. The decision was the
topic of the cloakrooms of both houses,
the lobbies, the departments and the
White House before the reajdlng had
concluded in the courtroom and so has
continued since with speculation as to
its wide and deep effect In politics
and businessâ as great, say the leaders,
in one as in the other.

WASHINGTON, March 21.â The
Â¦United States Supreme Court room is
In the old and main building of the
Capitol and is entered immediately off
e narrow passageway that is a part
of the thoroughfare that extends the
length of the building from the door
of the Senate to the door of the House
of Representatives in the north and
eouth wlng.Â«. The narrow passage sep
arates the courtroom from the clerk's
room ar.d opens directly into that ar
chitectural eccentricity known as Jef

this passage was the most frequented
on the morning of the merger decision
end the crowd in the courtroom over
flowed Into it. Before Justice Harlan
had fairly begun the reading, it was
known in the Senate and in the House
and members from each body joined
the rush. There had been a hint that
the opinion was to be handed down
end newspaper men already hud their
bulletins written to file. The mere an
nouncement that the decision had been
made was hurtled away over the wires
before it was known how it was to go.
This being announced, it became a race
between the several press associations
e.s well as representatives of gTeat
newspapers all over the country to get
to the wire and the wires to get the
messages away. The reading of the
opinion was followed :n its course by
a constant stream of bulletins to the

in the pre^s galleries.

G miming the Bar.
"The published information that
Frank Jordan, clerk of the Supreme
Court, had received a letter from
Washington, D. C, asking the feeling
out here among members of the bar as
to the advisability of their wearing
gowns in court," said a San Francisco
lawyer, "britgs to mind an incident
which occurred when that custom was
instituted in New York City a few
years ago. A Police Judge, smooth
shaven and austerely gowned in black,
had before him a small boy charged
with some slight infraction of the law.
Wishing to temper the judicial wind to
the municipal lamb, the Judge asked
the terrified offender, 'If I let you go
home .this time will you promise to be
good in the future?' The bewildered
boy looked at the gowned figure before
him, and apparently not being able
clearly to classify the legal being,
promptly answered, 'Yes, ma'am.* "
Debased French r Army.
The most significant of all the les
sons to be learned from the maneuvers
of the French army, which have been
recently concluded, 13 the failure in dis-'
cipline. Some incidents of the gravest
kind occurred while the maneuvers were
In actual progress. At Clermont-Fer
rand a sham fight was taking place
under a general of division. At the
moment of attack the general's staff
was fired upon. Happily, not one of
the officers was struck, but two horses
were killed. A number of men had se
creted several rounds of "live" car
tridges and had taken this murder
ous means of revenging themselves on
their commanders. At Xlort (Deux
Sevres) also, during the early days of
the maneuvers, a squadron of cavalry
refused to resume their march after a
short halt, alleging that they were en
titled to a longer period of repose. An
other case occurred at St. Mlhiel, where
two batteries of artillery abandoned
their pieces In the midst of, an action
as a protest against the insufficiency
of their rations.. The mutiny, of Poi
tiers occurred some months before the
maneuvers. A battery of artillery en
deavored to break out of barracks, and
it was only the presence of mind of a
senior sergeant in closing the barracks
gates and addressing the men that pre
vented a riot. Just about the same time
a rebellion broke out in the Ecole Poly
technique, where a number of students,
sitting for examination, left the hall as
a protest- against the introduction of
a new test subject. Students and ar
tillerymen were sent together to the
regiments in Africa, Afterward, how
ever, their sentence of expatriation was
revised by the Minister of War.â Pall

A Breezy Funeral.
One of the strangest wills preserved
is that of a Mrs. Margaret Thompson,
who, "in the name of God, amen." di
rected that in her coffin should be
buried all her handkerchiefs and suffi
cient of the best Scotch snuff to cover
her body, says the St. James Gazette.
This she preferred to flowers, as "noth
ing could be more fragrant and so
refreshing as me as that precious pow
der." Further, the six greatest snuff
takers In the parish of St. James, West
minster, were to be her bearers. Six
old maids, each carrying in " her hand
a box filled with the best Scotch snuff
to- take for their refreshment as they
walked, were to carry the pall. Be
fore the corpse the minister was to
walk, carrying and partaking of a
pound of snuff. At every twenty yards
a large handful of snuff was to be de
livered to the bystanders, while at the
door of the testator's house were to
be placed for gratuitous distribution
two bus^ls of the same quality of
snuff. Several legacies depended upon
the fulfillment of the conditions of the
will, and all concerned were bidden to
regard the powder as the grand cordial
of nature.

OF all animate nature probably no single individual
existence is more devoted to activity than the do
mestic hen. Long before "tired nature's sweet
restorer, balmy sleep," has fallen from the grateful eye
lids of mankind, the cheerful hen and her husband, gal
lant chanticleer, are astir. The husband of the feathered
females of the barnyard and chicken ranch is awake before
the sun sends its first beams over the eastern horizon,
and even may be heard stent6riously sending his chal
lenge to neighboring chicken coops not far from the
hour of midnight.
When the dew is on the grass chanticleer and his nu
merous wives, availing themselves of the still enduring
slumber of man, more especially of woman, arc likely to
be digging up the flower garden rnd the lawn and the
vegetable garden, and the, dirt flies as stout yellow legs
by'the score work with vigor and certain purpose. When
the- breakfast hour is over and there are scraps from the
table, the appetite of the hen familyyis still unapp?ased.
At the regular ration hours there are no visible reasons
why the roll should be called for the hens â they are "all
present or accounted for."
Every farmer's wife expends enough energy in a week
in "shooing" hens from prohibited haunts to perform
great stunts in the culinary line if the power were ex
clusively so directed. Small boys throw enough stones
at hens to make" them expert marksmen. A great indus
try is built up in the marketing of the hen family as the
basis of fricassee, chicken pie and other culinary prod
ucts dear to the palate of bloomy youth and rheumy
It is estimated that every hen is able, within certain
limits of its age. to yield an income of $l per annum
to its owner. . Theoretically, therefore, one has only to
raise 1,000,000 hens per annum to become a millionaire
in twelve months.
From every point of view the hen, therefore, is an
object of concern. Its cheerful duckings may be a
reasonable soliloquy or self-congratulatory remarks upon
its own usefulness. Â¦ -* . : <
Some recent figures that are published in the Petaluma
Weekly Poultry Journal, which is an authority on hens
and all that appertains to "biddy," show that all the
other acts of the busy hen are surpassed by its industry,
in California at least, as a producer of eggs. Accord
ing to the statements of the veracious chronicler of the
egg-laying industry of Californi. -where the climate
enables the hens to work twenty-four hours every day
in the year â 3,407,334 dozen eggs were produced in
Petaluma and in the immediate vicinity of Petaluma last
year. Reduced to units from dozens the eggs that are
attributed to Petaluma hens in one short period of twelve
months numbered exactly 39,888,008, and all were good
eggs when they, were laid.
Can any other birds in the United States give so ex
cellent an account of" themselves? Laid end to end, and
contiguous, these eggs would form a chain that would
extend with an unbroken food supply, two eggs deep,
clear from San Francisco to Chicago. While the ac
tivity of hÂ«ns in general is the subject of comment the
world over, that of the Petaluma hen is deserving of es
pecial commendation. Our. hat is taken off to the Pcta
luma-hen for her useful achievements, and may nothing
take place to addle her eggs and so curtail the immense
family of her worthy descendants that may spring from
them.

The Difference.
"I once saw the art of successful
story telling exemplified in a very
prominent way," said Senator Foster of
Washington a few days ago in a com
pany of friends. "During one of our
political campaigns a speaker had un
dertaken to tell a story that was in
tended to bear upon Ignatius Donnelly,
who was opposing him. The story was
told laboriously, and -it was received
with all the solemnity that would be
expected during: a funeral sermon. At
its conclusion the story teller smiled
and looked over his audience to see if
he could detect a ripple of apprecia
tion, but there they alltsat with sol
emn faces. It had fallen perfectly flat.
"In a short time Mr. Donnelly arose
to reply, and referred to the story that
had been told by his opponent.
" 'That story,' he said, 'was intended
to reflect on me, but it didn't go. Now,
my friends,* he continued. 'I have a lit
tle story I want to tell you.'
"With that Donnelly retold the story
that had fallen flat It seemed to me at
the time that he repeated it word for
word, but from the time he began the
story until it was ended the audience
was convulsed. It was pronounced to
be the best story that had ever come
out of the Northwest."
"Tell us the story. Senator," one of
his friends suggested, becoming curious
to know more of that narrative, once
funereal in its effect and then laden
with the spirit of wit.
"Oh, no," replied the Senator. "I have
not sufficient confidence in my story
telling ability. Now that I have pre
pared you for the story as a remark
able one, it 'would be doubly hazardous
to attempt to repeat it."
Senator friends are willing
to offer a reward for that story, either
dead with flatness or alive with wit. Ht
any one can deliver It to them. They
are being consumed with curiosity to
know what it is, but the Senator can
not be induced to venture upon its tell
ing.âWashington Star.

DIAMOND CUTTING GLASSâSub
scriber, City. It has been ascertained
by a series of experiments that a dia
mond does not cut the glass, file fash

that a continuous crack is formed
along the line of the intended cut
The superficial crack need not bÂ«
deep; a depth, according to fine meas
urements of a 200th part of an inch is
quite sufficient to accomplish the pur
pose. Stones, such as quartz and other
hard materials, when ground into
proper form will cut glass like a dia
mond, but are not so valuable for that
purpose, lacking the requisite hard
ness and soon losing the sharp edge
necessary to make the operation a suc

A Korean Legend.
The origin of the Korean imperial
family, which is just at present ex
periencing the pressing attention of
both the devil and the deep sea, is
sufficiently picturesqueâ that is, if it
is possible to believe the legend which
relates it. It seems that the favorite
wife of the King of a certain province
in North China was walking along the
banks of a river, when she noticed
something approaching with the cur
rent. The something proved to be a
large egs, from whicb, when it was
broken, errrrged a boy child of great
beauty. She carried the Infant to the
King, who seems, however, to have
been of a skeptical turn of mind, for
he ordered the child to be at once
thrown into the royal sties, .which
housed a peculiarly savage breed of
pig. Far from killing the, child, how
ever, they lavished porcine attentions
upon him, which,' being related to the
King, caused him to repent, to have
the child brought back to the palace
and to name it "Light or the Orient."
The boy grew up to so 'many virtues
and other excellencies that the King
again grew jealous and sought his
death. The young man heard of it
and 1 fled. Closely pursued, he arrived
at the Yalu River. He fixed an arrow
Into the water and at once a great
Governor Vardaman could do good missionary work,
South and North, by inviting the Governors of all the
States to meet in convention to consider ways and means
by which to make good the oath they have taken to^see
that the laws are faithfully executed. This is one way
and a good way, to bring about a permanently* better
understanding between the North and South. It is a sub
ject of national importance. When the whole country
has passed a year without, a lynching, the patriotic pride
of our people will be restored, and we can look the other
nations of the world in the face without blushing for our
lawlessness and inhumanity. Â«
THE whole country hears with pleasure the protest
against lynching made by the Confederate vete
rans of Mississippi. It is a powerful utterance in
favor of law and humanity, and while it will be influen
tial'-in the South, it is no less a call to the North for co
operation in an effort to relieve our national reputation
of a stain that persistent lawlessness has puO upon it.
The Way for this action was prepared by the Governor
of Mississippi, who personally interfered to save the life
of .a negro from a mob that was bent on lynching him.
Governor Vardaman has been the object of much un
favorable criticism on account of his position upon the
school question and his advocacy of a taxation policy
that will cripple schools for the negroes. But this is
condoned by his courageous stand for the law. He has
done more good by the example he has set for blacks and
whites in his State to follow in support of the law than
his radical views on education can do harm. He has
rendered the whole country a distinct and valuable ser
vice, for which the North will give him full credit. .
We do not hesitate to say that the North needed his
example more than the South, for we have been the
critics of the South in respect to lynching, while at the
same time we have tolerated mob murders, in States
where the passions which cause those crimes have far
less excuse than in the South. What possible excuse is
there in States like Ohio, Indiana, Illinois; Kansas and
California for mob law and lynching? All of those
States boast of the intelligence of their people and the
independence of their courts. In every case of lynching
in them the law would have deajt adequate punishment
to the persons who were executed cruelly and unlaw
fully.
There is absolutely no excuse for lynching. Grant that
there are delays, and that sometimes a criminal escapes
through the folly of a jury, even that is better than to
injure the good name of a State and tarnish our national
reputation by resort to lj-nching. The good effect , of
this Mississippi movement will be felt in the South,
where the negroes, simple, ignorant and imitative, when
they see white men disobey the law, are themselves in
cited to violate it in their personal conduct.
Lynch law is anarchy in its most dangerous form. It
is proved that it is no restraint upon criminals. They
fear only the sure and orderly processes of the law, and
when it is administered promptly and fearlessly they
soon learn that escape from its punishment is impossi
ble. But lynch law they may evade, and its conspicuous
element is that the rage that it expresses is as often
turned against the innocent as the guilty. What possible
excuse was there, for instance, in the conduct of the re
cent Ohio mob, which, after lynching a negro, put the
torch to all buildings occupied by negroes, endangering
the lives of innocent women and children and threaten
ing the whole town with a general conflagration?
We have many national societies and organizations
that deal with issues of manners and morals, habits and
conduct. The Mississippi Confederates may well invite
their old comrades in arms throughout the South and
their old and gallant foemen in the G. A. R. throughout
the North to join them in a national movement against
lawlessness and lynching. Such a national society,
formed' originally by the veterans of both armies, would
be a service to the whole country as great as that which
these soldiers in their youth sought to render to their re
spective sections by enlisting to fight for an idea. If
such a movement become general, lynchers will not es
cape punishment as easily as heretofore. And when a
few score leaders in lawlessness, orth and South, are
suffering punishment by the law which they have vio
lated, mobs will be less common and respect for the law
will be greater. â¢
Every man, white and black, in this country needs the
protection of the law, and when this fails he has no safe*
guard for any of his rights. The only way in which one
man can be sure of legal protection is by considering it
his duty to see that every other man has the same. The
man who lets his passions lead him into joining a mob
to murder a criminal by lynching has simply endangered
himself by weakening the legal safeguards to which he
looks for his own defense.
, The cigar clerk stood this little bit
of pantomime for several mornings,
but when he realized that it was not
the intention of his visitor to repay
the accommodation by the pifrchasinff
of his commodities, patience ceased to
be a virtue.
One morning the runty man went
through his performance as usual,
when the clerk, advancing threaten
ingly toward him, said: *
"Here, now, I'll huve no more of
that. You get right out of here."
"Get out? Do you know who I
am?"
"No, I don't. Who are you, nny
way?"
"Why," in a confidential whisper,
"I'm the man that comes in here every
morning to light his pij>e."
He was a short statured son of toil.
Regularly every morning he would
wander into a downtown cigar store,
but not to buy. On entering the place
he would take out a disreputable look-
Ing clay pipe, fill the bowl with to
bacco and light it on the cigar lighter
which was placed at the end of the
counter. Then, after giving the pipe a
few puffs, .he would silently wander
out of the shop again.
Told Who He Was.
Representative, Metcalf has been be
fore the Sundry Civil Appropriation
Committee during the week urging an
appropriation for the purchase of thÂ»
toll roads of Yosemite Park, for which
there is such urgent demand in Cali
fornia. The appropriation asked for I?
$208,750. Representative Needham makes
a special plea for the Merced Valley
read and $80,000 appropriation. Warren
B. English of Oakland is in the city In
behalf of the appropriation.
The offer of $1000 for the production
of a letter written by Representative
Victor Metcalf, wherein he asks any
body to line up anybody for him for the
United States Senatorship, which was
made by Mr. Metcalf at this same
meeting, still stands. The offer was
called out by a declaration of Senator
Perkins that the story of the letter
had come to him, but he said he did
not believe it and he would pay no
more attention to it than he would to
the other story which Metcalf had said
had come to him to the effect that he,
Perkins, was asking his influence In
behalf of Oxnard for Senator. Metcali
declared that he had assured Senator
Bard that he. Metcalf, would not enter
the lists against him should he be a
candidate and he would so reiterate.
The meeting, therefore, was not with
out interest though it failed of its pur
pose. The tart interchange has not
in itself done harm, for the failure of
the proposal must necessarily have left
some bitterness, and perhaps the frank
expression from both sides has served
to clear the atmosphere and effect a
better understanding.'
Bard disclaimed any intention of ap
pointing men objectionable to McLach
lan or any member of the delegation.
He had, he said, set for himself a rule
when he came to the Senate to recom
mend for reappointment all officers ap
pointed under the McKinley adminis
tration who had conducted their offices
properly. He had steadfastly observed
this rule save in the case of Frank
Flint. The appointment of Valentine
in his place was in response to the
urgent request of a group of men to
whose support he was largely indebted
for the honor of a seat in the Senate
and who had urged his nomination as
a recognition of a large element of the
Republican party In California. With
regard to Fickert, Bard said that he
and Perkins had agreed to leave the
appointment 'of his assistant to Wood
worth. Woodworth had recommended
the promotion of McKinlay and the ap
pointment of Fickert, ' and he, with
Perkins, had simply passed the recom
mendation along. With regard to the
postmastership at Sacramento, which
involved another Infraction of his rule,
Senator Bard said he had been in
fluenced to recommend R. M. Richard
son for the place by very strong in
dorsements of Republican leaders. Bard
said he had notified Coleman a long
time ago that a change was contem
plated and had given him time to pre
sent counter indorsements. These had
come very tardily and had not weighed
with those of Richardson.
handing about of offices to aspirants
is still a matter of regretful discussion
with the members. At the meeting
held in Senator Bard's office there was
a very frank discussion of the merits
of the case. Senator Bard, who had
proposed the plan by which the mem
bers of the House were to have a. voice
in the distribution of patronage, was
cited by McLachlan as offering a most
horrible example of the evils of the
present system. McLachlan said that
Bard had in a number of instances
selected his most inveterate -and out
spoken enemies for appointment to of
fices of great dignity and influence.
He declared that he had not only not
been consulted, but that in at least one
case where he had protested the ap
pointment had been made notwith
standing. This had worked injury to
his political interests besides offering
a slight to him as a Representative
Â¦and he was very much of the opinion
therefore that the proposal offered by
Mr. Bard himself, by which nothing
of the kind could occur again, should
be adopted. The instances he named
were the appointment of L. H. Valen
tine to the office of United States Dis
trict Attorney for the Southern Dis
trict, the appointment of George L.
Keeby es Assistant United States At
torney,' A. W. Kinney as Receiver
of the Land Office and J. C.
Cline Collector of the Port at
Los Angeles; Brown, brother-in-law of
Kinney, as Forest Reserve Supervisor,
and Fickert, Assistant United States
Attorney at San Francisco. None of
these were political friends of his, said
McLachlan. One of them had attacked
him with insulting epithets/in the
streets of Los Angeles and Brown, the
Forest Reserve Supervisor, had lined
up- forty rangers in his employ to fight
him at the polls. He said he had pro
posed his friend, Luther Brown, for the
Assistant United States Attorneyship
at San Francisco and Mr. Bard had
recommended Fickert because some one
eise had asked him to.
Gadsden's purchase it was supposed that he had accom
plished this. But he was a man unskilled in diplomacy
and ignorant of the Spanish language. The region cov
ered by the treaty was then as unknown as darkest
Africa is now and so we missed the chief value for
which we paid the wily Santa Anna a large sum. A glance
at the map will show how little we got and its small im
portance compared to what we paid for and failed to get.
Gadsden's inexpertness leaves the Colorado an interna
tional stream, and therefore liable to cause contention
with Mexico when we make such a large diversion of its
waters as will be needed to make fertile the Colorado
Desert. The Daniels bill may control the water in the
United States and disuse it for navigation in order to de
vote it to irrigation, but Mexico owns the How within
her territory for navigation or irrigation and we will be
subject to constant contention caused by the divided
sovereignty. of the stream. / : j*iZ-
In view of this we should make a new boundary treaty
with Mexico to repair the errors of Gadsden. To do this
requires the transfer of a strip of territory lying be
tween Nogales and the gulf and a worthless portionVf
LowÂ«r California below Tia Juana. It is probable that
this treaty could be made now with the Diaz Govern
ment and our California members of Congress should
urge it upon the administration. "If we wanted the mouth
of the Colorado in 1853 we surely want it more now, and
should save all disputes about diversion of water by ac
quiring it as soon as possible.

P. Schellberg of 85 Fremont street in
formed the board that notwithstanding
the -passage of the ordinance requiring

stantly increasing. Schellberg says that
the matter has been brought to the at
tention of the Board of Public "Works,
which claims It has no money to pay
Inspectors, although in the last budget
five inspectors of buildings were pro
vided for, whereas only three are ap
pointed b>v the board. Schellberg asks
that the. Supervisors insist upon the
Board of Works appointing the neces
sary inspectors to insure public safety.
Several housemovers complained that
the ordinance imposing a license of $25

When the name of Thaddeus Kauffelt
was called In Judge Mogan's court
there responded in person a good-look
ing young chap attired in full evening
dress. His expansive shirt front was
not as immaculate as virgin snow, nor
was the sheen of his patent leather
pumps as brilliant as it could have been
made, for he had spent some hours in
the tanks of t\f City Prison. But, nev
ertheless, he cut such an exceptionally
genteel figure for the Police Court that
the Judge stared at him. The prisoner
did not seem to relish the scrutiny, and
Bailiff Hickey offered odds that he was
some heavy swell who had been out
on a nocturnal lark, but Clerk Gray
declined to bet.
Police Officer Earle testified that
early yesterday morning he caught
Thaddeus in the act of drinking a bot
tle of milk that had been left on the
doorstep of 1374 Eddy street. When^the
court asked Thaddeus what his regular
occupation was Thaddeus replied that
he was a professional waiter and was
on his way home from work when the
policeman arrested him for no cause
that he, Thaddeus, could remember.
Then the policeman said he could get
the inmates of 1374 to corroborate his
testimony, and he was given a week in
which to round them up. The defend
ant was returned to the cage, where,
among the tatterdemalions therein con
fined, his fine raiment loomed like a
first-water diamond on a soiled sweater."
Harry Gallagher's wife left his home
about a week ago and neglected to re
turn. Harry's search for her was not
rewarded until about 8 o'clock Sunday
evening, when he perceived her aboard
a Mission and Kearny street car that
was crossing Market street. She was
accompanied by a man with whom she
seemed to be on terms of familiarity,
for she was laughing and talking to
him. Harry boarded the car and re
quested the woman to return to his bed
and board, and while the two were dis
cussing the suggestion the other man
struck the husband's face with his fist.
Then the trio mixed, and when they
appeared before Judge Mogan yester
day morning each of them had visible
evidence of the affray. The other man
turned out to be J. D. Bertkin, a Mis
sion street restaurateur, and it devel
oped that Mrs. Gallagher had been
working for him since she left her hus
band. After hearing both sides of the
story the court dismissed Gallagher
and pronounced the gallant Bertkin
guilty of assault.
Half a dozen citizens who had ig

There was no vexatious delay of law
in the case of James R,ogers, charged

urday night while ransacking the room
of John Sewelt at 547 Howard street,
and when Policemen Connolly and
Krueger searched him they found a
bunch of skeleton' keys and some of
Sewelt's property in his pockets. It

at $3000.
Anton Rulfs did not actually steal
a red-hot stove, but in Judge Conlan's
court yesterday it was proved that he
and another man, name not registered,
picked up a stove filled with burning
coals and carried it from the tailor
shop of L. B. Wiecz, 49 McAllister
street, to the outer air, and that every
foot of their progress was bitterly con
tested by Mr. Wiecz and several of his
workmen. Mr. Rulfs was arrested and
charged with battery.
The testimony went to show that
Rulfs manages a stove emporium at
1404 Market street and that Wiecz pur
chased from him a stove for $4, of
which he paid $3 down and agreed to
pay the remainder if he found the
stove was satisfactory. The try-out
proved the stove unsuitable and Rulfs
replaced it with one that also turned
out to be unsatisfactory to the tailor,
who claimed it did not properly heat
his tailor irons. Wiecz refused to pay
the dollar still due and Rulfs and a
trusty assistant went to recover the
stove. Thev found it packed with
glowing coals, but its temperatu/e did
not deter them from seizing it. Wiecz
and his aids tried to prevent the re
moval and in the struggle for posses
sion of the stove several gentlemen sat
upon it, but immediately, stood up
again. The Rulfs contingent finally tri
umphed, but not until Wiecz, in retali
ation for his loss of the had
snatched a watch chain from Rulfs'
vest, which he kept.
After much argument, the case was
settled by Wiecz agreeing to pay the
dollar and return the chain, Rulfs
promising to return the stove.

main at large. This request the court
heartily granted.
"Save me from my friends," said
Boulard, sarcastically, as he was led
away. , .
"I'm trying to save you from your
self," was the Judge's retort.
W. J. Barrett and Thomas Peck had
several bottles of beer in their pos
session when Officers Dowd and Brown
overhauled them last Saturday night
on the water front, and Judge Mo
gan yesterday continued the vagrancy
case against them until the policeman
can discover where the beverage was
obtained.
â¢ â¢ <
Sarah Martin has been given until
Friday to prepare a defense against
the charge that she stole $180 from
Steven Sedowy at 423 Washington
street.
Mrs. Nora Hartnett had her young
child with her last Saturday evening
when she met her friend, Mrs. George
O'Brien, and Invited that lady to par
take of liquid refreshments. Three
hours later the two women were in
toxicated and the little one was weep
ing when Officer Fogarty found them
at Taylor and Ellis streets. Judge Mo
gan's opinion of the' maternal care
shown by Mrs. Hartnett was neither
complimentary nor equivocal ' as he
fined the defendants $5 apiece.
Thomas Malone spent Saturday
evenirig at the Spider Kelly ball in
Mechanics' Pavilion, where he alter
nately dallied with Terpsichore and
Bacchus until he was so fatigued, both
physically and mentally,' that he was
unable to walk without staggering.
That was how he came to Jam his head
through the plate glass window of a
Ninth-street restaurant. He promised
to pay for the broken window,* and as
he had already expended a consider
able sum for sticking plaster, Judge
Mogan told him' to step forth a free
man.
Wesley D. Thomsoi) was talking as
he slept when he attracted the atten
tion of the night watchman of a San
some-street warehouse, and further in
vestigation disclosed to the property
guardian's gaze the recumbent form of
Wesley, also a window which he had
broken in order to obtain admittance
to the premises. The defendant opined
that he must have been "doped" ere
he laid him down to sleep in the ware
house, as he had no recollection of
how he arrived there. After Judge
Mogan had satisfied himself that Wes
ley did not mean burglary when he
broke the window, he fined him $5 and
ordered him to pay for the property
damage he had inflicted.
"But, Mr. Silk." said the court, "all
of us can'tj be models of masculine
beauty, you know, and it is our duty
to put up with whatever our allot
ment of good looks may be. Besides,
there is a proverb which says, 'Hand
some is as handsome does,' and I
find that your character is on a par
of unloveliness with your external
make-up. Perhaps six months in jail
may improve your mind, if not your
looks. At any rate, that is the sentence
I prescribe for you."
Mr. Silk did not seem to be in the
least affected by the severity of the
sentence.
Martin J. Silk, chronic vagrant, was
sentenced to six months' imprisonment
after he had ingeniously but vainly
endeavored to convince Judge Mogan
that the disorderly conduct of which
he had been proved guilty, had been
more than provoked. He was arrested
on Market street for creating a dis
turbance in front of a cigar store, and
he pleaded that the envy aroused in
him by the physical graces of a young
man who stood behind the store coun
ter gradually gave way to ire as he
realized how unkindly Providence had
treated him in its bestowal of personal
charms. As he gazed at,' the Apollo
like form and features of the cigar
seller and then contemplated his own
Calibanesque appearance . he became
filled with a great anger and would
have spoiled the beauty of the former
â"Handsome JImmie," as he called him
âif a policeman had not fortunately ar
rived in time to stay his threatening
hand. . ,
* * e
number that they did not perceive the
uniformed intruders until the hand of
the law was literally upon them. At
least that Is what the two officers tes
tified yesterday before Judge Mogan,
and the thirteen defendants did not at
tempt to contradict the, story. They
were given till next Monday to plead. ,

SpecliI Dlcpatch to The Call
RENO, Nev., March 21.â King Ryan,
one of the best known and most re
liable mining men in Nevada, writing
to the State Journal from Goldfield
under date of March 20," says:
"I have been In Ooldfield about five
days and thinking tfiat.it might be of
Interest to j-our readers I will try and
tell you of the conditions and the coun
try around here. This town is situated
in the foothills, about twenty-eight
miles south of Tonopah.* Houses, tents
and shacks of every description to the
number of about 270 comprise the town
and Its population at present numbers
about 1000. Stlnler is a prosperous
town and is located about one mile
from Goldfield. Milltown is one and a
half miles east of here, while Diamond
field is located to the northeast, about
four miles distant. All are promising
camps.
"I have covered considerable territory
surrounding this town and find that
almost every foot has been staked out.
The Combination and Kennel leases arc
about the only properties that are ship
ping ore at present. Ore assaying $2100
per ton Is being taken out by Kennel.
Two new strikes were made yesterday
in the January and the Ramsey. Pros
pectors have the entire belt for fifteen
miles in every direction staked out and
are working their claims. Meals are
reasonable and a hungry man can get
all he wants to e'at for 50 cents. Lodg
ings can be had at $1 a night. Leases
are being held out and it is a difficult
proposition to obtain one that has the
least semblance of value. The country
certainly bids fair- to support some
rattling lively camps in the near fu
ture. There is plenty of water at Gold
field and excellent water prospects at
the other 'camps."
Demurrer Snbmitted on Briefs.
The demurrer in the cases of Her
man and Jacob Eppinger, charged with
obtaining money by false pretenses,
was submitted on briefs yesterday and
the decision will be rendered by the
court one week from Saturday. The
argument for. the demurrer was made
yesterday afternoon "in Judge Lawlor's
court.
Opposes Amateur Clubs.
The petition of the Pacific Coast
Amateur. 'Athletic Association for an
opportunity to be heard in opposition
to. the granting of permits to amateur
boxing 'clubs riot members of the as
sociation was referred yesterday to the
Police Committee by the Board of Su
pervisors.

NEW YORK. March 2tâ Control of
the Morning Telegraph has been pur
chased from the estate of the late Wil
liam C. Whitney by E. R. Thomas. It
Â«at said to-night at the office of the
paper that the only reason for dispos
ing of the property was that Harry
Payne Whitney, executor of the estate,
has so many burdens that he could not
be exx>ected to continue as the respon
sible owner, and it is known that even
Xn the lifetime of the elder Whitney
many disinterested persons advised
him to dispose of the paper because of
k:s large turf interests.
Mr. Thomas purchased Herxnis for
â¢60,009 and is the owner of a string of
ether horses valued at $70,000. Since
fcig return to this country from Europe
Thomas has declared his intention of
fcplng a winner of sufficient stakes and
prizes this year to make him the lead
ing turfman of America, an honor
achieved in 1&03 by the late Mr. Whit
ney. â¢
6p*rl8! D!Â«p*tch to TbÂ» Call
Chicago fielded. a lot better than did
the native colts. Anderson really lost
the game for San Francisco in the sec
ond Inning, when his rank error let in
two runs. The teams were about even
up in th*e hitting department, but the
Chicago stars shone brightly on the
bases and were ever ready to turn a
trick there that might mean a run.
Dick Brown started in on the slab
for the big leaguers and Uncle's kids
began to wallop his offerings right
away. He walked Hildebrand, the sec
ond man up. Meany hit a straggler to
second and Evers fell down in trying
to field it. Irwin shot the ball over
the third sack and on this neat blngle
Hihlebrand came in. Leahy followed
with one out to center, which allowed'
Meany to land.
Chicago opened up in the second.
O'Neill drew the only pass that Cutter
issued during the engagement. Cor
rldon and Tinker hit. Then Evers
lined one at Anderson and he booted
the ball. This let O'Neill in and shortly
after Corridon came around on Brown's
force of Evers at second. An error by
Irwin gave the visitors a start in the
fourth inning. Then two more hits by
Evers and Brown brought home a pair
of runs.
In the seventh Lundgren went into
the box for the big leaguers and the
natives celebrated the event by getting
to him for two runs in a twinkling.
He was wild and walked Leahy, the
first man to face him. Then.. Massey
hit, but Schmeer forced Leahy at third.
Cutter drove one into right field and
Waldron followed with another that
scored Massey. Hildebrand kept up
the bombardment with a drive over
second, sending in Meany and tying
up the score.
It remained a deadlock till the
eleventh. Both teams settled down
and no more errors followed. It look
ed good for about fifteen innings when
Chicago had two men put out in quick
order in the eleventh, but Casey's
mighty swat over the right field in
closure ended it all, for San Francisco
could not come through with a run or
a hit in its half of the same round.
The same teams will hook up again
this afternoon at 3 o'clock. The score;

Though the game was interesting
and hair raising at intervals It did not
look like a championship struggle.
The Chicago team is a fairly fast ag
gregation, but San Francisco has seen
better ball teams in action, notably the
All Americans and the Nationals.
Though the visiting stars have had the
advantage of a lot of practice in the
last few weeks, they did not outclass
nor outplay the home aggregation to
any alarming extent.
Cutter, who. tossed the twisters for
Uncle, had a good day. He was steady
and lucky and also the umpire favored
him some. Taking these things into
consideration, he gave a very fair ac
count of himself.
The fans were treated to a glimpse
of Uncle's 1904 layout on the firing
line yesterday afternoon and the thou
sand or more that graced the bleach
ers and stands at the South Side park
went away, when it was all over feel
ing rather satisfied, for the native toss
ers fought a battle that savored of
real baseball. Chicago was worried
for many innings, but finally Casey
put the ball over the right field fenca
in the eleventh and then all was over.
Corbett announces that he is within
striking distance of the required weight
and can make It at any time now. Ho
has practically let up on his hard work
and will content himself with a little
light exercise from now on. His train
ers are very much pleased with the
champion's condition and say that there
is nothing lacking.
went into the gymnasium for an
hour or so yesterday afternoon and
pulled the machinery around till ha
worked up a sweat. Previous to that
the little fellow had his usual trot on
the road and came back with a healthy
glow on his face.
Britt put in a busy day over at Croll's
gardens, Alameda. He took two lorn?
runs on the road and then got busy in
the gymnasium. He boxed with FrÂ»d
Landers, punched the ba? and worked
the various machines around the place.
He is all but down to weight and ac
cording to himself and his trainers ;s
ready to enter the ring at any time.
"Kid" Hermann, the Chicago bracer,
seems very anxious to meet the win
ner of the battle. Last night he post-vl
$1000 at Harry Corbett's as a guarantee
that h2 would appear in the rins
against the winner. "Spider" Welch
wants to get on with the "Kid." but
\he latter seems to think he is entltle.l
to bigger garrfe and at the present time
will not listen to anything but Britt or
Corbett.
It is the general opinion of the wis*
contingent that the price will drop still
lower. Some figure that Corbett will
enter the ring next Friday night a
10 to 6 favorite, while others go a bit
better and prophesy odds of 2 to 1. If
the odds keep dropping as they hav-.
been doing It is not at all unlikely tha:
the latter price will prevail on the day
and night of the battle.
According to the best authority th*
odds are a trifle low at the present
time, and if the price becomes any
worse it will certainly be false. Cor
bett has no license to be a 2 to 1 fa
vorite over Britt. yet Britt's backers
appear to be holding back and from In
dications are desirous of getting thÂ»
latter price if there is any possible
chance.
As the days pass by tha Interest !n
the coming fistic engagement between
Young Corbett and Jimmy Britt in
creases. At the present time it is tha
talk of the town and every follower ot
the game la busily engaged In discuss
ing the respective merits of the rival
boxers or figuring out Just what odds
should prevail.
The wise /bettors like Corbett. That
was clearly demonstrated last night
when they were laying 10 to 7 oa his
chances of defeating the pride of San
Francisco. Â¦ This money was invariably
taken up in a hurry, proving beyo'id
a doubt that Jimmy's admirers ars
holding out for a good price.
The betting opened at odds of 10 to 8,
with Corbett favorite. There waa Kt
tle or nothing doing at this price, for
the Britt admirers had a huncn that
the odds would certainly become better
and therefore they held out. At 10 to
1Y 2 . the odds that prevailed a few hour*
later., the betting livened up a bit. but
the real doings did not materialize till
the price dropped to 10 to 7.
The admirers of Britt seemed to like
this and the Corbett money was Quickly
snapped up. The wagering becan.u
quite brisk late in the evening and a
large amount was staked about towi
on the chances of the rival lightweights.
No big sums were written, the average
backer being satisfied to make a bet
ranging all the way from $10 to $100
on his man.

With anything like fair racing luck
Jimmy Coffey would have taken the
next purse also, for his Foxy Grandpa,
the 9 to 10 favorite, was much the best.
Soon after the start Buxton, who rode
the black colt, was bumped and his
mount almost thrown. In the stretch
Travers, on the second choice, Harbor,
passed Box Elder. Later on he was
brought to a- hard drive in order to
get the decision from the first choice.
Buxton, on the latter, rode a very un
decided race through the stretch, get
ting Jostled or cut off repeatedly, or
he would have scored anyway. Jack
Little took show honors.
Several defeats did not cause the pop
ularity of Horton to wane, as the little
horse closed a 2 to 1 favorite for the
mile and a furlong selling event. He
was beaten several lengths at the fin
ish and at no stage looked like a win
ner. The ring laid the extremely long
price of 10 to 1 against Gateway, and
Tommy Lottridge's three-year-old dis
posed of Idogo, another long shot, by
nearly a length. Anirad, the 3 to 1
choice, astride which filly Knapp did
not furnish one of his best efforts, end
ed up in third position. Silurian ran
disappointingly.

started in the mile selling run, next de
cided. Rim Rock, with Mountain up.

after showing prominently to the
stretch ran unplaced. Powell handled
the 10 to 1 shot Past Master with ex
cellent judgment, winning ridden out
from Petrolia, also quoted at 10 to 1.
Toting Morello was third.
XOTES OF THE TRACK.
The purse won by Gateway did not
benefit Tommy Lottrldge any. The
three-year-old was bid up $300 over his
entered selling price by Charley Mc-
Cafferty.
Hulford, the clever three-year-old
owned by Harry Stover, is a full broth
er to Gaviota, a useful performer on
the New York tracks last season. As
a yearling Hulford was knocked down
to the bid of P. Ryan for $2200 at the
Xapa Stock Farm sale. The latter es
tablishment recently lost a suckling
brother of the two horses mentioned.
. Mat Storn was at the track again
yesterday after another severe spell of
illness. Mat says he will be fit and
able to pick some winners in a day or
so.
Ed Lanigan states that Miss Reel
foaled a fine looking bay colt by Rubi
con at Brentwood farm on Sunday.

It looked as if Galanthus held the
other starters in the six and a half
furlong event safe, and was according
ly installed a 7 to 5 favorite. Beeves
with quite a chunk of weight off from
his preceding race, looked the horse to
beat, but under mild handling ran a
cheap third. Hulford with "Big Bill"
Knapp looked troublesome for a time,
though finally led out two lengths by
the favorite. Captivate showed some
early speed. \
Two-thirds of the Oakland race
going crowd have not nearly as high
an opinion of Garnet Ferguson's colt.
Lord Wadsworth, now as they had
previous to the last event on the card
yesterday. Although the strapping
chestnut colt ivas conceding live
pounds to Solanus and Celebrant.it was
thought he could extinguish their
claims to greatness with the same
easiness that Young Corbett expects to
put away Jimmy Britt. Although a
world of money was bet on Wadsworth
It did. not prevent his price from go
ing back to 3 to 2, after opening a
9 to 10 favorite. Walter Jennings did
not think well of the chances of So
lanus, nevertheless the odds were ham
mered down from fours until 11 to &
was difficult to obtain. Celebrant re
ceived steady support at about the
same figure. George Wentworth
ducked the issue with Red Cross Nurse.
Charley Connell rode Lord Wadsworth.
and it cannot be said that he furnished
a gilt-edged exhibition. He raced his
mount out in the lead with Celebrant
to the far turn and it then looked as
if he wished to avoid the pace, for he
gave up second position to Solanus,
which colt had been outbroken at the
start. Turning into the stretch Mar
tin on the latter started after Sheehan
astride Celebrant with a wet sail. The
Hamilton Stable representative clung
on gamely, but at the finish was beaten
out half a length. The favorite when
too late closed very strong on the out
side, four lengths back.
The track was muddy and holding
and Galanthus was the one favorite
to land first. On form, though, the
bookmakers were clearly out of line on
Quiz II and Gateway.
Quiz II was always partial to heavy
or stlckv going, but despite this fact
the McCafferty gelding's odds receded
from 2 1 i to 3*^ to 1 in the betting on the
first event. He was ridden by C
Smith and, in front almost from the
start, won handily from Blackthorn, a
15 to 1 shot. Possart, which closed fa
vorite, finished an indifferent third.
Titus commanded some respect, but
Tommy Butler got him down in the
deep going and he did not prove dan
gerous.

the religion which has guaranteed the family,

of work â ta the field, at the machine, in th#
office â that they are not their own, but are

according to their own instincts; that they
cannot treat that which has been placed In
their hands as trivial, but that they have all
bÂ«?Â»n bought with a price; that they can- only
fulfill the purpose of their existence by Â»ervio*

Provision is made for a colonization
fund by having the Secretary of the
Treasury issue 3 per cent gold bonds,
payable not exceeding fifty years from
the date of issue to the extent of not
more than $50,000,000 and not more than
Jo.000,000 in any one year. The colon
ization bureau is empowered to make
loans not exceeding $1500 to any per
son duly qualified to enter land under
the homestead laws. Proper provision
is made for the security of the lands
and restrictions for the judicious ex
penditure of the loans received from
the Government.
In the preamble the bill urges the
necessity of relieving the congestion In
the larger cities and suggests the use
of the lands under irrigation by the
operation of the reclamation act of
June IT, 1902, in colonizing a large num
ber of families.
WASHINGTON, March 21.â To cre
ate a colonization bureau and to pro
vide for advances to actual settlers on
the public domain is the purproe of a
bill introduced in the Senate to-day
by request of Senator Hoar. It .. is
known as the Booth-Tucker bill and
is the colonization scheme of the" Sal
vation Army.
"WASHINGTON. March 21.âConsider
ation in the Senate to-day of the bill
providing for the purchase of a site and
the erection of a building for the De
partments of State, Justice and Com
merce and Labor -was made the occa
sion for adverse criticism of the archi
tect who planned the White House of
0oe*. Senators Hale and Teller led the
eliarpe on the architect and Newlanda
defended him.
Newlands took exception to the criti
cisms that have been made against the
architect cf the White House additions.
H'r said the architect did not know the
office building was to be constructed
v.hen he first took hold of the matter.
No^IandÂ»Â£aid that the arcades on each
side of the White House were in ac
cordance with the original design. He
also asserted that the cost had been
reasonable instead of extravagant.
Newlands. discussing the White
House offices, said that there had been
no material change in the general ap
rearance of the exterior, whereupon
Teller said:
"They have added to it what I think
i* a monstrosity and destroyed the
beauty of the building. I have yet to
see any one who has not agreed with j
me."
Hale declared that the intention of i
Congress had not been carried out. i
There should have been a two-story J
tmOdinc co the President would have i
his office upstairs, and people who go I
there would not have to be put into j
holes and corners. Hale said the mem- ]
btrs of the Appropriation Committee I
went to the President and urged him :
not to ha\ - e the original plans of the
White House changed. The President
assured them that *if he had to sit up
rights he would see that the original
plans were not disturbed by any archi
tect."
Hale spoke cf what he termed "the
Impudence" of the architect in declar
ing that the executive office was a tem-
I orary affair. The idea of the commit
tee, he said, was that It was to be a
permanent affair, and the appropriation
bill so provided. He criticised the pay- t
ment of enormous fees to the architects
employed in connection with the While
House improvements, and said they
had received JSOOO for the plans. Then,
he said, they charged a percentage on
de whole contract, as well as a per
centage on ever}- payment of the con
tract, and drew out of it J47.OOO.
Discussion of the bill had not con
cluded when the Senate, at 3:25 o'clock,
adjourned out of respect to the mem
ory of the late Representative Thomp
son of Alabama. The President pro
tern, appointed a committee to repre
sent the Senate at the funeral.
The Senate passed the following
measures: To promote the efficiency of

RIGHT OF HEARING. :
. After the reading of the lesson and |
another hymn. Dr. Wheeler delivered ]
the address. The remarks of the gifted ;
speaker were listened to with rapt at- !
tention. Dr. Wheeler said in part: j
The call to citiienship resounds throughout !
this land co-day as It never resounded beiore â !
as it never resounded in any land â in any time. I
Never In the history or mankind has there \
been a land Jn which the fate oÂ£ things rested Â¦
so clearly upon good citizenship as in this land !
of ours; and nÂ»ver In the history of this !
nation has there bsen a timÂ« when the call of i

tiers corr.bine>i bo thoroughly to make a de
mand upon good citizenship as in this day of i
these United States. â¢â¢Rlshtr.j-Jsness Is Good i
Citizenship." That Is the thÂ«me of what I 'Â¦
have to say this morning to you, and shall
shape the words that they may address them- '<
selves to ihcse who sit In positions of respon- i
Bibility and authority in the ornce. :
There never was. In the history of this pÂ»o- I
pie of ours, a time when the call for good
Citizenship was direct ar.d certain aa It Is to- '
day. â¢ The sudden budding out of the field of
nations] purpose haa opened questions In '

drir^ wrap his cloak about him in awe.
The lessen I would address to the business '

arises cut of the text. There Is no public In- I
stitutlon tos.Â»lble; there is not society; there ,
Is r-o state without some element of self- f
sacrifice â without something that partakes of t
the spirit of religion, without public spirit. '
without patriotism. It is impossible to found [
a state of society upon purely economfc con- j
slderations. Stats and society upon the basU â¢
of pure bread end butter considerations is a
forwgo^e impossibility. If we have drifted
toward that law. turn about. There can bÂ« so

office do? Of all the men we have. thosÂ« are Â¦

Involving the state; they are men who fee!

As a further mark of respect the
House at 1:20 p. m. adjourned until
to-morrow.
"The chair -will meet that question
when it arises," abruptly answered
the Speaker, who recognized Landis
of Indiana.^,-.
Consideration of other business was
objected to by Williams, whereupon
Wiley of Alabama announced the
death In this city of his colleague,
Charles W. Thompson, and offered the
usual resolutions of sympathy and re
spect, which were adopted. The
Speaker appointed a committee to
represent the House of Representa
tives at the funeral.
When the report of the vote was an
nounced Baker inquired of the Speaker
if he was to be permitted an oppor
tunity to explain his action.
being in session an hour and twenty
minutes to-day the House adjourned
out of respect to the memory of the

Thompson of Alabama, who yesterday
died in this city. Soon after conven

citing certain statements by Repre
sentative Baker of New York contain
ed in the Congressional Record of last

honor of Babcock of Wisconsin, and
providing that they be expunged from
the record, Hepburn explained that
Baker had not delivered them on the
floor of the House, but had inserted
them in the Record under a leave to
print. The amendment was adopted
after the Democrats had forced a roll
call.

The directors of the California
Woman's Hospital will give a clever
affair on April 21 and 22, when a
musical comedy, "His Royal Nibs,"
will be produced. It is said to be a
very clever skit and was builded by
home talent. Therefore will it have
to stand close scrutiny â for we all love
to pick apart the little musical and
dramatic doings of our fellow towns
man. The constructors of "His Royal
Nibs" are W. H. Clifford, who did the
libretto, and Howard Shafter, who
wrote the lyrics. Now, who knows but
San Francisco may some day rival
Bayreuth? Wagner wasn't always
great, nor was Bayreuth.
The charter will remain open for a
few months, closing when the mem
bership reaches sixty.
A new star appears in the galaxy
of clubs â the Cap and Bells â the
"cap" for academic pursuits and the
"bells" for fun and folly. Now, here's
a club that, clinging tenaciously to its
avowed purposes, ought to thrive mar
velously; for be it known that its
founders and charter members axe a
.quick, clever and capable coterie of
women, who believe in the efficacy of
i equal parts of fun and seriousness â
j with a slight leaning toward the
j "fun"; and in proportion to the
I recreation obtained in our clubs do
| we approach the standard of men's
clubs â where relaxation, not work. Is
the primary motive. Of course, the
"working" clubs, where sociological,
philanthropic and cultured work is
carried on, are of the most value to
the public, but it must be admitted
| that much is gained by the individual
j in a purely social and cultural club.
I And such is the new-born "Cap and
j Bells." Here's to it!
p The call for the preliminary meet-
I ing was issued on Thursday by Mrs.
W. P. Buckingham â and a few other
kindred spirits â and yesterday after
noon the women invited to join met in
the apartments of Mrs. 'Dorville LJbby
on Pine street.
With astonishing dispatch the meet
| iug was called to order. Mrs. Buck
1 ingham in the chair, and the tem
porary officers were forthwith se
lected.
The policy of the new organization
was then discussed, when along came
the momentous question of a name
for it. It was almost as hard as nam-
Ir.Â«? a baby. After a narrow escape
from "Iris" and a few other appel
lations, "Cap and Bells" was accepted
as Just the right name and the chris
tening was performed on the spot.
After a few preliminaries the regular
officers were elected and committees
on by-laws, ways and means, etc., ap
pointed. Now, how's that for dis
patch? And the ladies even found
time for a sociable cup of tea between
times.
The following officers were elected:
Officers â Mrs. \\". P. Buckingham, president;
Mrs. Squire Varick Mooney. vtc<? president;
Mrs. Dcrvfll* IJbbjr. corresponding secretary;
Miss EIizabÂ«th Edwards, recording secretary;
Mn. E. B. Grace, treasurer.

The killing occurred on the east
bound overland train about 12 o'clock
at night Just before it reached Auburn.
Armstrong was coming from Woodland
and Gostlin get on at Sacramento. They
were coming to Auburn on a lawsuit
over mining property. After leaving
Newcastle Gostlin, who was sitting in
the front end of the car, got up and
deliberately walked down to where
Armstrong was sitting and with the
utterance. "Now I've got you," drew
his pistol and shot with mortal effect.
Armstrong was apparently looking
out of the window at the time. The bul
let entered his neck and his body never
changed position. Armstrong was born
and raised in Placer County. He went
to "Woodland a few years ago. where
he married the pretty daughter of John
Freeman, a large cattle owner, retain
ing, however, his mining interests here.
It is understood that Freeman will put
up a large amount of money to assist
in avenging the killing of his son-in
law. It is not thought that a jury will
be secured before to-morrow night.
AUBURN, March 2Lâ The trial of
Thomas Gostlin for the killing of E.
il. Armstrong on January 9 last be
gan in the Superior Court to-day be
fore Judge Prewett. The case prom
ises to be the most sensatic-nal trial in
Placer County in years. D. M. Delmas
of San Francisco is assisting District
Attorney Robinson in the prosecution,
while the defense is being looked after
by L. L. Chamberlain. F. P. Tuttle and
J. D. Meredith. From the questions
asked prospective Jurors to-day by
Chamberlain it would appear that the
plea c-f the defense will be temporary
insanity superinduced by mining liti
gation and family troubles.
The defense will 'Claim that the de
fendant was robbed by Armstrong, and
also that Armstrong had been intimate
with the defendant's wife. Mrs. Gost
lin was present to-day and announced
that she would stand by her husband.
She is accompanied by ner two daugh
ters and six sons, two of them babies
in arms. W. H. Gostlin, a brcrther, who
is Postmaster at Hammond, Ind., is
also present. .

"Yocso Wostes: â I had freqnent
headaches of a severe nature, dark
spots before my eyes, and at my men- N
Btrcal periods I suffered tin told agony.
A member of the lod^e advised me to
try Lydia | E. Pinkham's Vege-
table Compound, but I only scorned
good advice and felt that my case was
hopeless, but she kept at me until I
boug-ht a bottle and started taking
it. I soon had the' best reaÂ«m in the
world to change my opinion of the
medicine, a^ each day my. health im-
prored, and finally I was entirely with-;
out pain at my menstruation periods.
1 am most grateful."â Xetteb Blactc-
mose, 23 Central Arc., Minneapolis,
Minn. â fSOOO forfeit If original of abon lettsr

from a wider experience in treat-
ing female ills.- She has helped

Soeder Is Arraigned.
Leon Soeder was arraigned before
Judge Cook yesterday on a charge of
murdering his brother-in-law, Joseph
Blaise, at Vallejo and Taylor streets on
Sunday night, January 10. He plead
ed not guilty and the Judge set the
case for trial on April 18. Soeder had
the same self-reliant air about him
that characterized his actions during
the preliminary hearing in the Police
Court-
The navy transport Solace arrived yesterday
from Manila. She brought home 209 short
time enlisted men, who will be paid off here;
14 lick, "1 prisoners and one straggler, a
member of the crew of the Supply, who was
lingering ashore when that .vessel sailed for
this port.
Among the other passengers were three of
ficers who will be taken to the Mare Island
Hospital for medical treatment. The names of
the invalida are Commander W. H. Beehler,
Lieutenant Charles Webster and Assistant Sur
geon L. W. BUhop.
After pabslng quarantine the Solace anchored
oft Folsoni-street wharf. Executive Officer A.
E Rogers then issued orders that only friends
of the officers be allowed on board. Lieuten
ant Rogers eaid he was "too tired to furnish
the newspapers with the usual information
about the passage." That there was some vir
tue in the executive officer's plea of weari
ness was evident from thÂ« bedraggled appear
ance of the Solace. Her decks were dirty and
littered with rubbish. Her paint and luass
work wore the green and unmlMakablc symp
toms Of neglect. As the" vessel encountered fine
weather throughout the passage and had on
board more than four hundred enlisted men her
appearance was something of a surprise. The
"weariness" Â¦ of Rogers, however, explains the
dirt and disorder and â¢ accounts in a measure
for the desire to bar the gangway against all
but friends of the family.
The Solace left here December 17 with crews
for th? gunboat Wilmington and the 'monitor
Monterey and stores for the naval stations at
Honolulu, Guam and Cavlte. She delivered the
stores on the outward trip and after a rive
days' etay In Cavite proceeded to Hongkong,
where the" Wilmington and Monterey were sta
tioned She returm-d to Cavlte and rf-malncd
there until the' squadron had finished target
practice. She carried 67 sacks of mail across

The Coptic took from here a large
shipment of mess beef, part of a pur
chase made in this country by the Rus
sian Government. When she reached
Yokohama war had commenced, and at
the request of the consignees the beef
was carried on to Hongkong. On the
advice of the steamship company's
lawyers in this city, however, the beef
was not discharged at Hongkong, but
taken back and landed at Yokohama,
as provided in the bill of lading. The
beef was stored at the Japanese port
and Is still there awaiting the action
of the Government.
The Coptic's passengers included the
following named:

of a strain received Saturday. A pasnlng
truck tipped over a pile of merchandise which
would havp fallen on Wilson had he not put
out his right hand and held back the weight
until he had a chance to jump clear. The

The Republicans of the Sunset and
Richmond sections of the city are
getting ready for vigorous work in the
coming campaign. A large and en
thusiastic meeting of the Citizens' Re
publican Club (independent) of the
Thirty-ninth Asse/nbly District was
held last evening at Richmond Hall
with President Edwin T. McMurrav in
the chair. The principal business
transacted was the adoption of the
report of the committee appointed to
draft a constitution and by-laws.
The name of the organization was
changed to the Independent Citizens'
Republican Club. A proposition to
consolidate with the other Republican
organization in the district, the In
dependent Republican Club, was re
jected.
A resolution offered by Lyle H. Ped
lar indorsing the administration of
President Roosevelt and asking the
State convention to instruct its dele
gates to the National Convention in
his favor was adopted unanimously
| and with much applause. The next
I meeting will be held Monday evening,

BARKENTIXE TROriC BIRD WHICH ARRIVED YESTERDAY THIRTY-ONE DAYS FROM TAHITI IN COMMAXDOF FIRST
MATE AGGER CAPTAIN JACKSON WHO HAD COMMANDED HER FOR MANY YEARS. HAVING DIED AFTER BRIEF
ILLNESS DURING THE VESSEL'S STAY AT PAPEICTE. â¢ I
ThÂ» Matscn Navigation Company's steamer
Rosecrans, seventy-two hours out from Port
land, whither she went to deliver a cargo of
oil. arrived in i>ort yesterday afternoon look
ing much the worse from one of the severest
storms that has been felt alonz the coast for
many months. Captain Johnson reported that
his vessel left Portland Friday mornlngr about
4 o'clock and when about ten hours out she
encountered a terrific gale. For fourteen hours,
during which the Rosecrans was able to make
headway of only a mile an hour, the vessel
was tossed about on the raffing sea. The
wind was from the southeast and blew at a
rate of eighty miles an hour. Heavy seas
continually washed the decks fore and aft and
smashed several of the small boats and did
other damage above decks. For a time It was
feared that the Rosecrans would not weather
the storm, but the wind finally subsided and
the Ions looked for harbor or safety was soon
sirhted, much to the relief of all on board.
Among the Rosecrans' passengers were Cap
tain W. H. Patterson, a well-known Cotumbia
River pilot, and his wife, who came down to
this city on a visit. Captain Patterson stated
last evenlnc that the storm was one of th*
worst that he was ever in and that the vessel
survived it he attributed only to the fact that
she is an exceptionally seaworthy boat. The
ordinary time made by steamers between th*
two norts Is about fifty hours.
Weathers a Fearful Gale.
Convicted of Grand Larceny.
George H. Jamison was convicted by
a jury in Judge Dunne's court yester
day on a charge of grand larceny and
will be sentenced on Saturday. F. M.
Black, a Pullman car conductor, out
of friendship purchased Jamison's dis
charge from the army for $100 and
shared his room with him at 238
Powell street. On June 15, during
Black's absence, Jamison stole his
clothing, dress suit case and other
articles.
Regarding the transfer of the prop
erty and his connection with It Mr.
Solomon said: "I held Mrs. Bell's note
for $G200 for services rendered as her
attorney a;id Mrs. Pleasant's note for
$3000 for services rendered as her at
torney. To secure these notes Mrs.
Pleasant deeded me the property. After
deeding it she filed suit to recover on
the ground that it did not belong to her,
but to a niece of hers. It was proven
It did belong to Mrs. Pleasant, subject
to my claim.
â¢'Mrs. Bell then sued me, claiming
that Mrs. Pleasant had always held
the property in trust for her and had
no right to deed it to me. Judge Sewall
held it belonged partly to each, subject
to my claim, and either one had a right
to release by paying me my money.
The SuDreme Court upheld the decision
hnd to-day Mrs. Bell paid me what was
due and I gave her a deed to the prop
erty.
"In the meantime Mrs. Pleasant had
deeded the property to Fred Bell and
he in turn had deeded a one-half in
terest to Samuel Davis of Carson City,
Xev.
"Immediately upon receiving my deed
Mr?. Bell transferred the property to
John P. Overton. president of the Santa
Rosa Savings Bank."
It is now expected that Davis and
Fred Be!l will sue Mrs. Bell and Over
ton on the strength of the deed given
by Mrs. Pleasant and the wretch*.!
family skeleton of the Bell family may
once again be brought into court. The
show will lack its star attraction, how
ever, as Mrs. Pleasant has crossed the
borderland and will never again be a
conspicuous figure in the courtrooms.
The recording of two deeds yester
day afternoon marks the ending of one
long-pending suit and seems to throw
out the gauntlet for another in the
contests over the Bell estate. The first
ol the two deeds conveys certain prop
erty on Bush and Sutter streets, abut
ting on the famous "house of mystery,''
from Lucius L. Solomon to Teresa Bell.
1 he other conveys the same property to
J. I*. Overton. In both cases the mere
Jtgal consideration of $10 is mentioned,
although it is stated that the property
la worth at least $30,000.

Ocrfrymrn <>f the evanselioaJ denom- j
inati.vrjs were out in force at their ;
weekly association gatherings yester- j
day. j
Tho Presbyterian ministers met in j
th? mOT-ning at the Prrsbytorian House, j
Sacramento strict, and listened to a |
well studied and interesting review on â¢
A. M. Fairbairn's "Philosophy of the j
chriFtian Religion" by the Rev. J. M. \
Maclrinis.
irrv. Mr. Maclnnis tnok exception to :
the matmcr in which the theories of ,
Mr. Fairbairn ypemed to him to be j
ir.< onsiFtrnt with his own phik-.=ophiral
irifals in l^arr.inB. Mr. Fairbairn boins
too hard upon critical and evolutionary
;heories. i
The Hex. Mr. Maclnnis rontonded
ihflt the true philosophy of relipion is
to be four.d in man created in the i
image <'f God whose rapacities were j
f-j':.v"dpm<mstrated in Jrsus.
He Â«-a!!od attention to the fact that Â¦
tb? Darwinian evolutionary theory.
chlch predominated all scientific re-;
soanh fifteen years ago, is now being j
rejected by the prcat German j-cien- j
lists.
Â¦â¢This spe."' said the speaker, '"is char- !
actcrized by much literary activity and :
Â» lamentable barrenness of great liter- j
nture. I r.m of the opinion that Fair- i
bairn'* book is one ef the greatest in ;
ii j= department.*!
[n the discussion that followed the j
reading of the paper the Rev. E. K. â¢
Strong declared that he had little pa- j
tleace with the theory of man's evolu- j
ti'.'n from the lower animals.
C.OP MADE A COMPLETE MAN.
He considered it a false statement !
and a false doctrine and was satisfied j
that OJod knew what he was doing j
v. hen he made man in his image. The ;
speaker said that. th<?ugh God made ;
a cbmplele man, he may not have made j
a perfect man.
The Rev. Richmond Logan Raid that !
Fairbairn makes the statement that '
man in his original form was half man :
and half brute.
In his ravage state the Rev. Mr. Lo
pan considered that man was three
quarters brute and on<?-quarter man. j
In that state he was capable of sink- ,
ing b^low the brute creature, for he |
deF.-ended to brutalities and cruelties
not known in brute creation.
The Rev. James Wood worth added
to tn> speaker's remarks by saying '
v. ith emphasis that they could find!
m.Mi in this community below the
hrute. I
The Rev. Mr. Bevier admitted the
prcatness of the book under ministerial j
review* though he took issue with it in j
the premises. His opinion was that j
Kiiirbairn interpreted Christianity too j
much alone the lines of comparative |
religion, while Christianity was really j
unique. He was of the opinion that !
:he true conception of advance in life j
is regeneration rather than evolution.
The Rev. Mr. Bevier paid his com
l lirnents to the late Herbert Spencer,
whose agmosticism he considered "rot
ten to the core," while he admitted
that some of the philosopher's thoughts ;
Klonx scientific lines were worthy of
Â¦ Â¦â¢Â¦ â¢nsidersLtion.
Dr. GL Campbell Morgan's evangel
istic services held in the city last week
ttcre discussed on the initiative of the
I'.ev. Mr. Bevier, who pronounced the
service a. distinct blessing to San
Francisco. '
A committee consisting of the Rev.
Mr. Bevier, Rev. Mr. Strong and Rev.
Mr. Herriott was appointed by the
â¢ hairinan. the Rev. Moses Bercowitz,
to arrange with the ministers of all
evangeli'-al bodies for a return of the
noted evangelist to San Francisco.
Among those present were: Rev.
Mo*es Bercowitz, president of the
Presbyterian Ministers' Association;
Hew EL K. Strong. Rev. J. R. Evans.
Rev. J. M. Maclnnis, Rev C. C. Her
riott. Rev. H. N. Bevier, Rev. James

"Emotionalism in Religion" was the
subject discussed bv the Rev. Dr. E.
F. Brown of the First M. E. Church
before the Methodist Ministers' Asso
<iaÂ«ion yesterday. Dr. Heacock pre
sided and there was a large attend
ance.
Some of the arguments that followed
had a strong tendency toward Dr.
Brown's views and deprecated the
use. of artificial expedients in arousing
the emotions of the congregation.
While it was conceded tJiat emotions
must be aroused to produce religious
life, the consensus of opinion was that
!f anything was to be accomplished it
must be by the power of truth and not
extravagance.
It was generally agreed that the gen
eral average intelligence of modern
congregations made impossible ex
travagances of emotionalism so char
acteristic of some revival services in
the past.

CHICAGO. March 21.â Additional rainfall J
over a large section of the Southwest since !
Saturday Imparted weakness to the wheat '
market at opening to-day. Other factors that
tended to intensify the selling pressure were
easier cables, liberal world's shipments and
increased amounts on passage. The combina
tion was too much for the majority of holder*
and in conaequence great quantities of long
wheat were throvrn upon the market. May was
neither wanted nor pressed for Rale in any
considerable quantity, but offerings, email a a
they were, could not be placed at swiftly
yielding prices. Within an hour the price of
the May, option had fallen to 91 cents. July,
In the meantime, declined to S5%c. Short*
who had put out wheat earlier In the day
then commenced to cover, causing a rally of
about a cent In the price of both deliveries.
On the up-turn more wheat dune out and the
market again declined. There was no news
of importance to encourage buying. As a re
sult about the only demand throughout tho
entire sÂ«es*lon wÂ«Â» from shorts, who. had prof-
Its In sight. The closing was about steady,
with May at 02 cents. July closed at su;;Â©
fe'JUc. â¢
Wcaknru in wheat had a depressing Influ
ence on the corn market, causing heavy liqui
dation early In the day, which resulted in
looses cf 1 cent In July and nearly 114 cents
In May. The closa was steady. May closed
i^c down at 52*ic. .
Oats, ruled comparatively firm In the face
of weakness In wheat. May closed Mt^YtC
lower at 40 cents; July closed V*c lower 'af
Prorlsions werÂ« Inclined to weakness on
celling by commission houses and packers.
Lower prices for hogs at the yards, together
with the break in wheat and corn, were the
main bear Influence. Pork showed the great
est decline, closing 15c lower; lard closed 6c
down and ribs were off 7V4c.

Tte immense voinm* of sales three years

suddenly made without even the thought of

t?-an ten days there Â»â¢Â»* a panic that convulsed
ihe financial world .,.- if by an earthquake.
The effects cf that have not even yet passed
away.
The speculatioa of March 10 signifies cau

overtradlrs of tfcree jearf ago. As that was

In a review . of the Orange situation pub
lished In a recent issue of the California Fruit
Grower. It is pointed out that the condition of
the market during the greater part of the cur
rent season has been the worst ever known In
the history of the Industry due largely to com
petition of Florida and Porto Rican Oranges
In the Eastern markets, the unfavorable
weather In the southern part of this State,
which prevented the .fruit from ripening In
time for the holiday trade, and the freezing
weather In the East when the movement of
the crop commenced. Other unfavorable fac
tors, according to the same article, were the
rivalry over the auction sales between the
Citrus Union and the Independent receivers,
which tended to depress values, and the un
reasonably slow time made by cars from the
growing districts to the Eastern markets,
which resulted in heavy deliveries of more or
less decayed fruit, and a consequent loss to
shippers.

Local trading in Oranges was more active
than on Saturday, owing to clear sunny
weather, and a fair inquiry was noted for
shipment to Puget Sound and to Honolulu,
but Â»upp|ies were still in excess of the de
mand and prices showed no improvement,
either in the open market or tn the auction
rooms. Standard Naveis still showed evidences
of decay and were neglected by buyers, owing
to the abundance and comparatively low prices
of the better grades. . The auction eale was
well attended and eight cars were sold, as fol

Attorney Knight endeavored to break
down her testimony at every point, and
made all of the capital he could out of
the fact that a record of the testimony
given at the; former trial was in the
Pullman in which the Eastern wit
nesses crossed the continent" and that
they* were given. an opportunity to*re
fresh their memories. Miss Bateman
answered his cross-examination with
out- varying her statements in the
slightest, and generally made an excel
lent witness.- She admitted? that she
had been- promised $100 in addition to
her .expe.nse3, N .out of which" she was to
pay a substitute teacher who was act
ing in her place during her absence.
1 Miss Ethel J. Millington, daughter of
a -hotel T keeper at Dover,, followed. , She
also : partook of one piece of the ; pois
oned candy, haying visited, the Pen
nington home on .the 1 evening of Aug
ust I 9, 1S98. At that time : she viewed
the wrapper, handkerchief 1 and note in
the package and identified them as be
ing those offered 'as exhibits during
the; present trial") by, the, prosecution.
She was taken ill. the following morn-,
ing : -with nausea* and ;sent for Dr.
Bishop, -but-he : was so" ; busily Â« engaged
Next came Miss Josephine Bateman,
who happened to be passing the Pen
nington home on the night In question
and was called to the porch. â¢ Mrs. Dun
ning held the candy on her lap and
handed Miss Bateman the wrapper that
she might examine It. She identified
the exhibit. as the wrapper she had ex
amined that evening in much the same
manner as did' the preceding witness,
and also identified the handkerchief and
note' that had been shown her by. Mrs.
Dunning as being similar to^those of
fered in evidence by the prosecution.
Miss Bateman ate one of the choco
lates and discovered; three hard lumps
in it, which she spat out. Subsequently
by . comparison she -. : - determined that
these were crystallized arseqpe. On
reaching home she found a foreign sub
stance adhering to her gums, which she
removed,- and this .she subsequently
concluded was arsenic. That night she
was taken with violent nausea, which
lasted for several days, and her gums
were badly inflamed. It was not until
after 1 the ; burial , of -Mrs. Dunning and
Mrs. Deane : on . the following Monday
that she concluded she had been suf
fering from arsenical poisoning.

He identified the wrapper on the par- !
eel, which is one of the people's exhib- j
Its, by the fact that the word "Dela
ware" on the address was' spelled "Dele- \
ware" and that on the corner of one of j
the stamps appeared the letters;
"Franc." He said that the probable!
sender of the candy was discussed by'
all present, and it was finally decided |
that it came from San Francisco, al
though the identity- of the donor was]
not arrived at. Heate one of the pieces J
of candy and was taken ill that nightTT

which he delivered to her as she sat on
the porch of the Pennington home in
company with Mrs. Deane, Leila Deane
and Elizabeth .Dunning, then a child
6 years old. He told of Mrs. Dunning
opening the package and finding a box
of candy therein, together with a
handkerchief and a note containing
the words: "With love to yourself and
the child."
Harry C." Pennington; brotherjof the
two murdered women, was next called.
He told 'of havingT eaten dinner/ with
the family at Dover on the evening of
August 9, 1898, at which they partook
of trout, eggs, coffee, corn- "fritters,'
bread and ;. butter. J> John B.\ Penning

Oscar Tolle, Chief Deputy Clerk, of
the Supreme Court, in wfyose -custody
the exhibits Introduced at the first
trial of the case have remained, was
the first witness called. He Identified
the exhibits one by one as those hav
ing been in , his custody and .testified
that they had remained locked up iii a
vault since the first trial, except on
two occasions, when some of .them
were delivered to the then Chief of
Police, Lees, on an order from court.
He said that he had taken ; a receipt
from Lees for the exhibits turned over
to him and that subsequently the same
articles had been returned to the .wit
ness. Attorney Knight, for : the , de
fense, made the most of the fact that
some of the articles had been out of
the custody of the deputy clerk for
some time, but the witness' identifica
tion of the exhibits in question robbed
this fact of .whatever significance it
might have possessed. .
Miss Elizabeth Kemp, assistant to
the postmaster . at Dover, was next
called; -She identified the wrapper as
being similar to the one that covered
a parcel she put into' the Pennington
box . on August 9, 1898, and stated
that the address on it 'was' similar jto
the one she had no'tice'd in Dover'on
the day in question. The wrapper and
box of candy. were then introduced.in
evidence, despite a vigorous ; protest
from Attorney. Knight that no ; suf
ficient identification had' been estab
lished. " -
August 9, .1898,. and the receipt of the
box of candy on that evening by Mrs.
Dunning, it having been delivered to
her by/ Harry, C. Pennington, her
nephew/ who had taken it from the
family box at the postofflce. Bying
ton said that the , prosecution expected
to prove that this candy had been pur
chased in San Francisco by Mrs. Bot
kin and that in many of the pieces
there had been placed crystallized ar
senic by the defendant; that the poison
had' been purchased at. the : Owl ' drug
store by the defendant on ' the plea
that she wanted to bleach some straw;
that it had been mailed In San Fran
cisco by the defendant, addressed to
Mrs. Dunning, and that the sending
of the poisoned candy was premed
itated and for, the purpose 61 mur
dering Mrs. Dunning. ..
He went into' the unsavory, details ot
Mrs. Botkin's and Jo^n P.~-Dunning's
mutual Infatuation and. the attempts
inthis-city of Mrs. DunningV to re
claim her erring husband until at last
she gave up the effort and returned to
her father's home in Dover. The Dis
trict Attorney was unsparing in his re
marks when he arraigned the defend
ant as a cold-blooded and conscience
less murderess, -who "deserved, the ut
termost limit of punishment. Under
the bitter arraignment* Mrs. Botkin
winced visibly and frequently shook
her head as though condoling with her
self . Â¦-: /: . 'Â¦>Â¦ Â¦

TIFIED YESTERDAY AT THE SECOND TRIAL. OF MRS. CORDELIA BOT-

"Stop this at. once," said Judge Cook
peremptorily, "or I'll fine both of you
for contempt. You are behaving- like a
couple of boys and should be ashamed
of yourselves."
The examination proceeded without a
further outbreak/ It was only 4:30
rf"clock when Miss Deane was dis
missed, but Judge Cook' ordered an ad
journment until 10 o'clock this morn
ing, when the hearing /-ill continue.
Mrs.- Cornelia Burbank, an elderly
dressmaker, insisted "upon entering
Judge Cook's courtroom in the after
noon to listen to the testimony. When
told not to make a noise she began to
scream and was promptly arrested for
'disturbing the peace.'
Attorney Knig"ht and District Attor
ney Byington clashed during the morn
ing session and the war of words was
only quelled when Judge Cook, sternly
threatened to fine both of them â¢ for
contempt unless they desisted. Knight
was endeavoring to ascertain hoto
much Miss Kemp expected for coming
West to testify in the case. ,
"Would you accept $400?" he asked.
"I guess you would accept $400,
wouldn't you?" interrupted Byington.
"I want | It I distinctly understood,"
roared Knight, "that I am not receiv
ing a single cent for my efforts In this
case."
"We'll have to take your word for
that," sneered Byington. "^j,
.The floodgates of Knight's anger
burst. "What do you mean?" he de
manded; "a little fellow like you talk
ing that way to me!"., v-: ;
"I'll say what I please to you," said
Byington. "Your bluffs won't work
with me."
Miss Leila Deane was the star wit
ness of the day. She is a decidedly
pretty girl of 19 years. Since the trag
edy she has removed from Dover to
Philadelphia with her father. She was
on the porch of the Pennington home
with her mother and aunt and little
Elizabeth Dunning when Harry C. Pen
nington delivered the fatal parcel. She
saw Mrs. Dunning open it and take
out the handkerchief and note. She
identified. the handkerchief by the cost
mark on a paper tag In one corner and
the letter by the handwriting. She
also identified the wrapper on the par
cel in the same manner as the other
witnesses. Miss Deane was remark
ably clear regarding all the circum
stances on the evening In question.
She was awakened about midnight of
the same date by groans from her
mother and she described the symp
toms of her mother's illness minutely.
Mrs. Deane suffered excruciatingly un
til noon of August 11, when she ex
pired. Mrs. Dunning died the follow
ing day. Attorney Knight indulged in
a vigorous cross-examination of the
witness, but she was not to be shaken
in any of her statements. She had par
taken of cne of the chocolates and sev
eral caramels and was ill for several
days, being attended by Dr. Bishop.
From the three last witnesses Dis
trict Attorney Byington was careful to
draw the fact that they had partaken
of their, evening meal In company with
members of their various families and
had not eaten anything else during the
evening except the candy and that only
those that had partaken of the candy
suffered death or illness.

Deane and Mrs. Dunning that he could
not come. Her cross-examination was
brief and profitless so far as altering
any of her statements was concerned.
She was asked about remuneration,
and stated that outside of her expenses
she had no definite promises of pay
ment for her journey and the time con
sumed in the trial.

The morning proceeding opened by
the issuance by -Judge' Cook"" of Â¦?. an
order excluding ; all witnesses ; ; from
the I courtroom \ until their . testimony
was "needed. Then : District Attorney
Byington made his opening address.
He detailed . the members .of i the ; fam
ily living" at "the: Pennington ' home on
admissible. . ' , .
Mrs. Botkin, the defendant, was early,
in court. She was gowned as â¢ before,
except that she had discarded -Â¦-, her
Jacket for a long black coat, lined with
lilac colored satin, which she hung over
the back oÂ£? her chair.' The' heavy
black veil' had -been replaced with one
of lighter texture, so that her fea
tures were plainly discernible. She
kept her / back uncompromisingly
turned to the spectators and they had
no chance to see her face. . When she
first appeared in court her eyes were
Bwollen and she: appeared .to have been
weeping. She listened to the various
witnesses with almost painful inter
esU but did 'not display. any nervous
ness'and seldom consulted with her at
torneys^ Her sister, Mrs." Roberts, sat
by -her side in silence, as usual.
WITNESSES EXCLUDED.
One startling fact was elicited from
Miss, Deane, which, "however, did not
get into the record. She testified that
Mrs. Pennington, since deceased, ac
cepted one of the bonbons and started
to eat it, but spat it out, remarking
that the candy was not ' good.-: The
bruised chocolate fell in the yard,
where a rabbit belonging to little
Elizabeth Dunning nibbled at it - and
wks subsequently found dead. AsMiss
Deane did not see the rabbit "eat the
candy, the court held the evidence in-
The principal witness introduced was
Miss Leila Deane, the 19-year-old
daughter of one of the murdered wo
men. She was present when the fatal
box of candy was delivered to Mrs.
Dunning, saw it opened, partook of
some of the candy, knew of the death
of her mother and aunt of her "own
knowledge, described 'their symptoms
and was generally conversant with all
of the facts the prosecution expects to
prove so far as the transactions at
Dover,, are concerned. She was a wit
ness in the former trial and proved
remarkably capable at that time. Since
then she has lost no recollection of
the ""tragic death of her mother and
aunt and the circumstances leading up
to the tragedy.
Three other important witnesses from
the East were examined. They were
Harry C. Pennington, who secured the
box of candy from the postofflce; Mrs.
Josephine Bateman, a school teacher of
Dover, Delaware, who saw the opened
box of candy in Mrs. Duhning's, lap on
the evening of August 9, when it was
received through the mail, and who
partook of one of the bonbons, and
Miss Elizabeth Kemp, assistant to the
Postmaster at Dover, who received the
box of candy at the Postoffice and
placed it in the box of John B. Penning
ton, father of Mrs. Dunning and Mrs.
Deane, with whom they made . their
home.
RABBIT WAS POISONED.
So great was the crush during th^
morning session that the air of the
courtroom was almost unbreathable
and Ingress and egress was impossi
ble. In the afternoon session Judge
Cook ordered that the aisles be kept
cleared and three policemen were de
tailed for that duty. This lessened the
attendance in a large degree, but the
ejected ones loitered in the corridprs,
hoping that some of those in the court
room might become wearied and de
part, thus "making room for others.
During the morning session while the
District Attorney in his [opening "state
ment was referring to ihe liaison be
tween John P. Dunning and Mrs. Bot
kin, which is ascribed as the motive
of the crime, a group of women grew
so boisterously mirthful that Judge
Cook ordered them excluded from the
courtroom and the bailiff put them out.
IMPORTANT WITNESS.
Packed like cattle in a chute, a mot
lejr throng, a half of which was com

mors, milk crust, scalled head, eczema,,
rashes and every form of itching, scaly,
pimply skin and ecalp humors, with loss
