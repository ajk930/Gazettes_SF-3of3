in the strike of the members of the
Western Federation - of Miners more
than a year ago, when 4000 men â¢ quit
work for. the' purpose, primarily, of en
forcing an eight- hour, day. This' action
so incensed the mine owners that they
declared war? on unionism, and the
breach has grown wider with the pass

DENVER, June. 6.â A "reign of terror,
brought on by a diabolical dynamiting
plot, followed by rioting and an as
sault upon the militia,, exists in the
Cripple Creek mining district to-night.
Armed men throng the streets and con
flicts are of hourly occurrence. Militia
men are marching, hither and thither,
making arrests by the wholesale. A
number of union miners have been
placed In the military "bull pen" and
others are bejng gathered in at fre
quent intervals. City and county offi
cials have been compelled to resign
their offices because of their reputed
union sympathies.
As nearly as can be estimated to
night, 22 men are dead and a score or
more wounded as a result of the events
leading up to the conditions described.
Beginning with' this morning, when an
infernal machine, set under the station
platform at Flndley, on the line of the
Florence and Cripple Creek Railroad,
was touched off and a number of non
union men, who were waiting for a
train, were sent Into eternity and oth
ers horribly mangled, conflicts follow
ed thick and fast. They culminated
in a riot at a mass meeting, where bul

and a number wounded.
Later, as a company of militia was
marching past union headquarters
pursuing Its search for union miners,
it was fired upon by armed men-con

stormed the building and from last ac

N. W., WASHINGTON. June 6.â Miss
Alice Roosevelt ended her eventful St.
Louis trip late this afternoon In a
narrow escape from serious Injury In
a carriage accident. She '..as assisted
put of danger Just in time by the
faithful family footman and walked
with her maid to the White House un
concerned.
Miss Roosevelt came from St. Louis
with her maid and arrived at the
Sixth-street station shortly- after 5
o'clock. She was met by the White
House brougham with a single horse,
driven by the "second" coachman.
"Charley" Reeder, the regular White
House footman, was on the box.
All went well until the brougham,
with Miss Roosevelt and her maid In
side, reached the corner of Fifteenth
street and Pennsylvania avenue, which
passes for Washington's "dead man's
curve." Here there Is always a con
gestion of street cars and other ve
hicles and crowds of passengers.
Just as the driver was about to turn
the curve by the Treasury and the
Riggs House a heavily crowded street
car dashed up to the Junction and the
carriage was for a moment pocketed
between the car and an empty hotel
carriage. The horse took fright at the
clanging of bells, plunged
and ' became unmanageable. Several
men recognized the President's livery
and willing hands were outstretched to
subdue the Infuriated animal. The
driver bravely kept his seat, struggling
to manage the horse, while Reeder
sprang frbm the box and went to the
rescue of his young mistress.
Just as the carriage appeared to be
turning on Its side Miss Roosevelt was
literally dragged out by the footman
and at the same time a policeman on
the other side rescued the frightened
maid. The horse was finally subdued
and the carriage escaped complete de-
Etructlon between a lamp post and a
hotel van.\MBft:lBP11 l ffffCHTOl

guard, almost entirely destroying it in
a hand to hand fight. They afterward
encountered the fire of Japanese in
fantry.
"Two squadrons of our cavalry and a
battery of machine guns i hurried up
and then, retiring, drew after them a
second squadron of Japanese cavalry.
This squadron followed until it came
into contact with a detachment of
chasseurs, who succeeded In firing eight
volleys at a fixed range into the squad
ron, which then fell back, naving suf
fered considerable loss.
RETIRE IN DISORDER,
"While retreating to the left, the
Japanese squadron came under the fire
of a company of the Frontier Guard,
which had advanced, and the squadron
retired in disorder. Our dragoons came
up at this moment, but owing to the
topographical conditions they could not
participate as part of our front, but
fired upon the enemy from the heights
north of Lutsiatun. .".;;
"Discovering our endeavors to turn
their left, the Japanese retired to a
second position. Our battery got into
position and opened a successful fire
on the Japanese infantry with machine
guns. â¢
"Meanwhile a movement of the en
emy's infantry toward Lutslatun was
observed and subsequently, at about
2 p. m., dense lines of Infantry were
seen occupying the crest of the heights,
which had been previously occupied by
dragoons.
"Our losses were Lieutenant von
Meyer, seriously wound. d; Lieutenartt
Brandt, slightly wounded; three men,
killed and forty-two v.-ouncled.
"It appears from a report found on
the body of . a Japanese non-commis
sioned officer that* the Fourteenth
Dragoons alone lost seventy men.
JAPANESE DRIVEN* BACK.
"Our Cossacks were fired upon by
Japanese infantry occupying a fortified
position on the heights near the vil
lage of Khotslaputse, eighteen miles
from Fengwangcheng. At the outset
the Japanese attempted to advance
across the . valley of Koaullndzypho,
but were stopped by an accurate fire
from our 1 field guns, which the Cos
sacks had succeeded in bringing into
position.
. "The Cossacks dismounted and, with
the aid of reinforcements and the fire
of two guns, forced the Japanese to
abandon their position and retire under
cover of their Eupports. The engage
ment lasted from 1 p. m. until 6 p. m.
"On the Japanese side six companies
took part, four having arrived as rein
forcements. The intrenchments of the
enemy were well constructed- and per
fectly masked.
"Our cavalry worked the guns ad
mirably. Their fire contributed prin
cipally to our success. Our losses were
the gallant Cossack chief, Strakoff,
killed: two officers slightly wounded
and two bruised. The Japanese losses
were not ascertained, except that they
wire larger than ours."
KUROPATKIX'S MOVEMENTS.
Commander's Headquarters Are Now-
South of Liaoyang.
ST. PETERSBURG. Jurve 6. â The
military attache of a first-class power
has telegraphed here that General Ku
ropatkin's headquarters staff ht.8
moved forty miles south of Liaoyang,
to a point between Haicheng and Da
f hisziao.
Kuropatkin's move is .considered to
possibly_ foreshadow severe fighting in
the northern part of the Liaotung pe
ninsula, but it is a mistake to assume
that his action involves a change in
the position of the Russian main
army, which, according to the best
Information, remains at Lioayang.
Kuropatkin is on board a special
headquarters train, which is constant
ly at his disposition. His trip may
be only for the purpose of personally
examining the situation.
DESTRUCTION OF GU.VBOAT.
Jtussian Craft Believed to Have Struck
a Japanese Mine.
TOKIO, June 6. â The destroyer flo

from the eastward reports that at 7:40
l>. m. on June 4 a Russian gunboat
of the Giliak ts-pe was seen to explode
and sink near Chentaoshan. The ves-
Bel. with another gunboat, a destroyer
and other steamships, evidently was
engaged in clearing the vicinity of the
mines. When the explosion occurred
the others hurried back into Port Ar
thur. Vice Admiral Togo expresses
the opinion that the explosion was
caused by a Japanese torpedo. " ' -
The name of the gunboat destroyed
Is unknown, but it had been seen be

to be quite well esteemed.
Ella Beatty was arrested here sev

The bullet rams near hitting an auto

Special Dispatch to The Call.
Several years before the war, he said,
Japan had sent its agents into Russia
for the sole purpose of studying vari
ous methods for combating with the
CossacTts in the event of war, for it
was generally believed that the most
dangerous arm of the Russian military
service would be these mounted men.
Many reports, devising ways and
means for making the Cossack 7 attacks
on, Japanese infantry nugaiorj'i were
submitted by the Japanese * agents to
the Tokio authorities and eventually
resulted in the .adaption of a small,
quick-firing machine gun, with a range
qf 4000 yards and light enough to be
easily -.carried 1 ' on the back of a small
Japanese pony.
With this gun goes a small tripod. It
takes less than a minute for a battery
of four men to remove the gun from a
pony and fix>it in position for action
on the trippfa. It can be swiveled in.
any direction and while in action Its
zone is untenable for anything living.
"For months Japan schooled its in
fantry and artillery in the use of this
gun," continued Shlraishi, "and to the
accuracy of the men who- have re
cently handled them may be attributed
much of the success of the victories
over the Cossacks. Japan tio longer
fears the pride of the Russian soldiery
and the world will soon realize this faci
when Its news gatherers have told
t .em of the deadly effect of the little
machine gun. The minute a band of
Cossacks are sighted by the Japanese
forces off ctones the gun fronv the
pony and a few minutes later the rapid
fire of the weapon sunds the death
knell of the Czar's famous riders. To
this giyi may be attributed the small
number of casualties among the Jap
anese, 'â¢Â¦' u o have already met the Cos
sacks, for. as already explained, few
live to tell of their experiences within
the zone of the death . dealing ma
chine." .
The fall of Port Arthur was certain,
he said, and when asked when he ex
pected the Japanese to occupy the Rus
sian forts he replied with a smile,
"You may look for lt very soon."
Realizing that there is little need for
the steamers recently appropriated, the
Government. is releasing the vessels as
fast as it can spare them, and Shir
aishi predicted that it would not be
many weeks before the Toyo Klsen
Kaisha line would be bidding again
for American business. Referring to
the recent events of the war and par
ticularly to the achievements of the
Japanese land forces, especially in con
flict with the Cossacks, Shiraishi re
marked that the precision of fire from
the Japanese side had dispelled the tra
ditional idea that the Russian Cossack
was invincible. â¢ â¢
M. Shiraishl of Toklo, general man
ager of the Toyo Klsen Kalsha Steam
ship Company, whose vessels were ap
propriated by the Mikado for service
as auxiliary cruisers ln the Japanese
navy, arrived here vesterday by way
of Victoria and is registered at the St.
Francis. He is on his way to "Wash
ington on business concerning the re
sumption of the service pf his company
between Japan and this port. He was
met in Portland by William H. Avery,
general agent of the company In this
country, who accompanied him to this
city, where he expects to remain for
several days looking into matters per
taining to Pacific Ocean traffic. Ite
gardlng the probability of the Toyo
Klsen Kaisha resuming service on the
Pacific, Shiralshi said last evening that
he expected j that the Government
would soon release all the steamers it
had taken, numbering in all about ten,
which formerly plied between Yoko
hama and San Francisco and Victoria.
"When I left Japan," said he, "the
Government had already released sev
eral of the trans-Pacific steamers, upon
which the owners were hurrying the
work of reconstruction with a view of
getting them back into the regular
runs across the ocean. The release of
these vessels depends much on the
progress of events before Port Ar
thur.".

that no claim should be made against

UP THE FIGHT
CHINESE CAMP, June 6. â An Aus
trian miner named Michael Tomich
was Instantly killed to-day at the Re
publican mine. In company with an
other miner Tomich was hoisted to
the two hundred foot level. The can
dle Tomlsh was carrying went out and
while groping his way in the dark he
fell 300 feet down the other compart*
meat of the shaft.
FALLS THREE HUNDRED
FEET TO INSTANT DEATn
By order of Major H. A. Naylor of
the National Guard the bodies were re
moved from the Coroner's establish
ment to another undertaker's. This
action was taken on request of J. S.
Murphy, superintendent of the Findley
mine, because, it . is alleged, the Cor
oner had remarked before the discov
ery of the : Infernal machine that the
death of tho men was due to an acci
dent. Later Coroner Doran explained
that although he had"spoken of the dis
aster as "an awful accident," he was
The infernal machine used to-day
was similar to the one'expldded in. the
Vindicator mine on November 21, 1903,'
killing two men." n â¢
The infernal machine with which the
diabolical work was done consisted of a
quantity of dynamite estimated at 150
to 300 pounds, a loaded) revolver and a
long, slender. steel wire attached to the
trigger. The revolver was fastened so
that the pulling of the trigger would
not draw it away. The wire ran from
under the depot to the cribbing of the
Delmonico property, about 400 - feet
away, where Its end was fastened to
the rung of a chair. The dynamite
was placed close to the muzzle of the
revolver, which was discharged by
pulling the wire when the engineer
blew his whistle. The ball from the
revolver exploded the dynamite.
A man was seen running down the
hill from the Delmonico after the ex
plosion. The Victor troops, who were
ordered out by Mayor French, were so
stationed as to keep persons from pass
ing rn-er the path taken by this man
and bloodhounds were sent from Canon
City and Trinidad for the purpose of
trailing the assassin.
A majority of the dead and injured
were single men, but several had
families living in the district.
Charles Rector, of the Shurtleff mine,
escaped by a miracle. He was chat
ting with several men, unconscious of
danger, when the explosion occurred.
He saw a number of men rushing
toward the depot and at this moment
he was lifted from his feet and deaf
ened by a terrific crash. When he re
alized what had occurred he was sur
prised to find himself uninjured.
H. W. Van Atta, one of the Findley
miners, who had a remarkable escape
from death, in describing the explo
sion, said: -â¢ i
"The earth seemed to heave under
the platform and depot and the noise
made was deafening. We had been at
the station about two minutes when
the explosion occurred. I was thrown
through the air about seventy-five feet.
There were about twenty-five men on
the platform and most of them were
non-union miners who worked on the
Findley. The Shurtleff shift had not
yet reached the depot, but was hurry
ing down the hilL Had these men
reached the platform the casualties
would have been doubled. There must
have been 300 pounds of powder used
and It must have been set off by an
electric spark or revolver, as the min
ers would have smelled the fuse if one
had been used."
George Remick was hurled many
feet from the platform, but escaped
with only a few bruises, although heavy
timbers and rocks fell all about him.

almost certain that several of them will
die.

of the dead, pieced together as well as
possible, were removed to the Coroner's
office. -
Sol-Jiers under the command of Major
Naylor this afternoon notified all
hardware and gun stores in Victor not
to sell any firearms or ammunition
without a permit from "him or the po
lice authorities and then to take the
name and description of the purchaser.
The demand will be complied with.
Among the mines that have already
closed are the Stratton Independence,
the Last Dollar, the Theresa and the
Shurtleff. These properties employed
nearly 1000 men.
City Marshal â¢ O'Connell of Victor
was suspended by Mayor French and
Major H. A. Naylor was appointed

union miners to resist. .<

The honeymoon will be spent in a lit
tle cottage across from Port Arthur at
a summer resort where only foreigners
go. Haskins bought a piece of property
there, and has built a home. The hap
py event is of great interest to promin
ent society people in this city, because
of the popularity of the groom, and a
mighty chorus of Los Angeles good
wishes accompanies Miss Gowan. The
lovers have not seen each other for two
years. Â¦
LOS ANGELES, June 6.â "If you
can't come to get me I will go to you,"
wrote Miss Elizabeth Gowan, one of
San Francisco's fairest society girls, to
Thomas W. Haskins of Los Angeles,
who is now assistant secretary of the
United States Legation at Peking,
China, and without waiting for an an
swer she made her preparations for de
parture and will sail from San Fran

band beyond the sea. All alone on the
big ship Siberia with a trunk filled with
pretty trousseau mysteries and a box
of wedding gifts In the hold below the
little bride-to-be will travel 7000 miles
and spend thirty long days of restless
anticipation. .
Tom Haskins is a graduate of the
University of California, and for two
years made a specialty of study on for
eign commerce. When Congress passed
an act authorizing the President to ap
point ten young men to go to China and
study the language for two years, two
of these men were suggested by Presl
dent;Wheeler of Berkeley, and Haskins
was one. He had been studying Chinese
for two years, stood high on the rec
ords, and left with enviable recom
mendations. 1 Minister Conger asked for
his appointment as assistant secretary
to the American Legation and it was
granted.
Upon Miss Gowan's arrival at Peking
she will become the guest of Mr. and
Mrs. Williams. Mr. Williams being the
secretary of the legation under Min
ister Conger, and Haskins' chief. The
wedding was not to take place until
September, but it is understood among
Haskins' friends In Los Angeles that
it. will occur shortly after Miss Gowan
arrives.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Night Clerk Davis, who sleeps in the
office, says that he was awakened by
the sound of breaking glass, and a
pistol muzzle was pressed against his
head. He was ordered to make no out
cry, and then was marched over to the
safe and threatened with death if ha
did not open it up in short order. Un
der the threats of the desperado Davis
opened the door to the outer safe. The
robber took the bag of coin and imme
diately left.
Enough disturbance was created by
the robber in making his escape from
the office to attract the attention of
John McMillan, night watchman, and
Smith, the pier watchman. Both offi
cers started in pursuit of the robber,
calling on him to halt. The latter
quickened his pace, and when a shot
was fired over his head he whirled
about and exchanged shots with the
officers. None of the bullets, so far
as known, did any damage, and the
thief made good his escape in the dark
ness. He was traced to the beach,
where he made a wide detour to avoid
observation and then came uptown.
Oncjs on the streets, all trace of him
was lost.

â¢DENVER, Colo., June 6.â Adjutant
General Bell was informed by tele
phone from Victor that an attack had
been made late this afternoon on
Miners' Union Hall by a squad of sol
diers. Major Naylor sent squads to
aid in quelling the disturbance on
Fourth street. When the uni
formed men swung into . Fourth
ptreet thev were fired upon from
houses on both sides of the street.
They returned the fire and raced on at
double, oulck until they were neat-
Miners' Union Hall. At that point the
mob had scattered and as the soldiers
halted several shots were fired at them
from the windows of the hall.
The doors of the building had been
left open and a dozen guardsmen fired
their rifles into the hall as fast as they
could work the mechanism of their
rifles. After a few volleys the order
to take the place by assault was given
and "they plunged in. It J was reported
to General Bell that a number of men
were killed, but none of the guardsmen
were injured.
The detail of guardsmen vps in com
mand of Captain Harry Gt Moore of
Cripple Creek.
The following union men were wound
ed: Peter Calderwood, Edwin Mc-
Kelvy, Arthur Parker, Thomas Mc-
Manus.
There were about sixty miners in the
hall. Soldiers stationed in the streets
and on roofs of buildings across the
street fired volleys through the cur
tained windows of the hall.
After exhausting their ammunition in
return fire the miners came downstairs
with hands uplifted and bearing a
white flag. They were surrounded by
the soldiers and escorted to the "bull

Nearly all the mines in the district
had been closed by order of the Mine
Owners' Association, and hundreds of
miners flocked into town from the sur
rounding hills. Fully 1200 supporters
of the association gathered about Ar
mory Hall, where it was meetinsr. At
the same time 1000 men, armed with
all sorts of weapons, were assembling
on the vacant ground at the corner of
Victor avenue and Fourth street, in
response to a call for a mass-meetine.
Most of these were union men. who
declared their intention to resist to the
death any attempt to run them out of
the district. City Marshal Michael
O'Connell hurriedly swore In sev
eral hundred citizens, most of
them union men, as deputy po
licemen, after being refused ad
mission to the Mine Owners* head
quarters. After a conference with Sher
iff Bell and a number of mine owners
Mayor Frank D. French removed Citv
Marshal O'Connell, who then dismised
his deputies.
Then followed the rioting. After it
began Sheriff Bell ordered out all the
soldiers in the district. He also- ap
pointed'scores of deputies.
Previous to the rioting Sheriff Henry
M. Robertson had been summoned
to a meeting of the Mine Owners' Asso
ciation in Armory Hall by a committee
composed of C. C. Hamlin. secretary
of the association; J. S. Murphy, man
ager of the Findley mine, and L. E. Hill
of the Theresa. At this meeting his res
ignation was demanded. He yielded
to the demand. Then Edward Bell
was appointed by the County Commis
sioners to fill out Robertson's unex
plred term. Robertson was a union
miner before he was elected Sheriff.
Bell is a member of the Citizens' Alli
ance.
An eyewitness of the shooting said:
''I saw them carrying men away, one
shot through the head and another shot
through the arm. I think that a dozen
were shot."
SHERIFF MADE TO RESIGN*.
Secretary Hamlin, who had been
standing on a wagon, kept on talking,
unmindful of the hailstorm of bullets
that whizzed about his head. v^- â¢
After the first excitement had some
what died* out, the wounded and the
dying were gathered up.
R. McGee of Victor, who was in
stantly killed, had been, standing , en
an embankment thirty feet above the
men who had been fighting and was
an innocent spectator. Alfred Miller
and J. D. Davis were carried to the
Victor Hospital, where the latter died.
A free for all fight followed and
shooting began. . Most of the shots were
directed skyward.
Hoskins fell with a bullet In his body
and the crowd scattered in every di
rection. - â¢
HAILSTORM OF BULLETS.
William. Hoskins, a union miner from
Goldneld, threw up his hand and
shouted, "Let me talk."
At this the crowd began to hiss Hos
kins and cried, "Put him out."
COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo., Juno
7.; â A special from Victor to the Ga
zette after midnight says: At 12:30
o'clock this morning the streets of Vic
tor were still tliron_ed with' men and
excitement ran high. Sheriff Bell
seems to have obtained control of the
situation at this hour, but the tension
is so high that any little thins might
cause an outbreak. Reports of Sheriff
Bell having been shot are without
foundation. Sheriff Bell has sworn in
more than 300 deputies. Store than
100 811*6818 had been made by mid
night.
VICTOR, Colo., June 6.â Rioting
broke out in this city this afternoon
while a mass meeting was being held
to discuss the murder of twelve non
union miners by means of an infernal
machine at Independence. Forty shots
were fired into the crowd in the street.
Two men were killed and at least nine
persons are injured. R.' McGee of Vic

Secretary Clarence C. Hamlin of the
Mine Owners' Association, concluding
a short address, had said:
"I want to hear what the boys In the
mines have got to say about this
trouble."
"The courts of the State have no
right to interfere with the military au
thorities and their handling of prison
ers.
"They have no power to attempt to
discharge military prisoners."
The contention of the appellant that
thÂ«Â» military prisoners should be turned
over to the civil authorities is charac
terized by the court as absurd.
The question which the court was
asked to decide was of such vast Im
pi nance to the State that seven prom
itifnt lawyers wre asked as advisory
vi-uncil to submit opinions. Charles
Hughes, one of these, it is understood'
did not send in any opinion. The other
?:x pplit evenly. Those who sustained
the position of the Governor were At
lorneys I_ A. Goddard. Platt Rogers
and A- C Field. Former Governor
Charles S. Thomas, Leroy Stevick and
Harvey Kiddie dissented from the
opinion of the court.
DENVER, Colo., June 6.â The State
Supreme Court to-day refused the ap
plication for a writ cf. habeas corpus
lor Charles H. Moyer, president of the
Western Federation of Miners, who is
held as a military prisoner at Tel
luride by order of Governor James H.
Feebody. Thts Governor's action In
declaring martial law In San Miguel
County, Imprisoning Moyer and other
union men on the ground that they had
Incited insurrection and rebellion, sus
pending the writ of habeas corpus and
Ignoring the authority of the local
courts, as seems necessary to him in
maintaining law and order, is sus
tained. Chief Justice Gabbert and
Justice Campbell concurred in the de
cision. Justice Steele dissented.
The opinion of the court was given
by Chief Justice Gabbert. Its main
points are as follows:
"The Governor has sole power to de
termine when a state of Insurrection
exists in any county in the State. The
courts have no power to interfere with
his exercise of this prerogative.
"The Governor has the right to use
the military forces of the State to sup
press insurrection.
"He has also the power to order the
imprisonment and the killing 6f insur
rectionists if in his opinion that ex
tremity is necessary.
"He can detain military prisoners un
til he decides that the insurrection is
quelled.

Mrs. Bailey and Miller were to have
been married within a week. The
shooting took place in Mrs. Bailey's
apartments and it was four hours la
ter before the police were Informed.
The theory of the police is that Mrs.
Bailey shot Miller while in a jealous
rage because of his failure to name a
definite day for the wedding ceremony.
Little is known of Mrs. Bailey's life
prior to the death of her husband. Dr.
S. G. Bailey, who was a member of the
staff of Wesley Hospital and a lecturer
at the hospital clinics. Her maiden
name was Barrett.
'CHICAGO, June 6.â When Mrs. Re
becca Bailey called at the Wesley Hos
pital to see her fiance. Loul3 Miller,
who had been taken to the Institution,
fatally wounded by a bullet, she
was arrested on a charge of shoot-
Ins him. At the time of her arrival the
man was making an ante-mortem
statement, accusing her and the police
were searching for her. He died soon
afterward.
It Is taken by District Attorney Gar
van to show clearly that 'no idea of
suicide had entered Young's mind at
that time.
That remark .made by "Caesar"
Toung to Frederick Michaels, the cab
man who drove the horseman down
town w ; ith "Nan" Patterson, throws
strong light on the^mental condition of
the man, who, it is asserted by the
woman, committed suicide a few min
utes later.
NEW YORK, June 6.â "Hurry up
and get to the Fulton-street, pier, as
quickly as you can. I'm afraid I'm
late."
Young's Order Indicates That He Did
Not Contemplate Suicide.
TOIiI> CABMAN" TO HURRY.
In New Rochelle funeral services
over the body of Young were held. The
interment will take place to-morrow
morning.
John Randolph Patterson, the aged
and decrepit father of "Nan," Is in
New York battling for the freedom of
his daughter. "Nan" had been es
tranged from her parents, but when the
present trouble came upon her, her
old father, whose home Is In Washing
ton, forgot the differences of the past
and brought with him to his daughter
the blessing of her mother and assur
ance that his last dollar would be spent
in her defense.
Patterson is not a man of wealth,
but it now appears there is to be no
lack of money for the defense of his
daughter. "Nan" Patterson had other
admirers than "Caesar" Young and
funds will be ready to meet any emer
gency. It may be that real estate ball
will be refused to-morrow, in which
event $5000 cash' will be forthcoming.
Unger does not place too much reli
ance in what Dooley says, recognizing
that there are some points of his story
which do not coincide with what has
been told by "Nan" Patterson.
FDENRAL SERVICES HELD.
Henry W. Unger is of the opinion
that the story told "by James E. Dooley
may have an important bearing on the
case. Dooley says:
"I had been at work on the Richard
Peck, which lies up in Peck slip., on
East River. I was paid off last Thurs
day, and as I left the ship I was ac
costed by a longshoreman with whom
I have been acquainted several months.
He wae "broke," and I purchased a re
volver from him. It was a Smith &
Wesson, hammerless, with a black grip.
When I bought the weapon it was
fully loaded, but I shot at a bird in the
river and did not replace the cartridge.
"On Friday night I was out with
sr.me friends and drank too much. By
Saturday rr.orning 1 had no money left
and needed a drink. I was on Broad
way. When near the corner of How
ard street I met a well-dressed
stranger, wJio showed that he had been
drinking. I asked him for the price of
a drink and he took me into a saloon,
where he offered to buy champagne. I
told hkn that wine was too rich for
me. and that what I wanted was some
thing to cool my thirst.
"We had several drinks and were
about to separate when he said he
wanted to buv a revolver. I offered
mine to him and he said that it would
do. He gave me $2 and he showed a
large roll of bills. I asked him what
he wanted with the revolver and he
said that he wanted to do up a woman
or that a woman was going to do him
up. I don't remember which it was,
but it was to do with a woman. I
saw nothing of a woman with him and
I saw nothing of a cab. I know that
it was about half-past eight o'clock
Saturday morning, or perhaps a few
minutes later, when I left the man
who had purchased my revolver. I
say a picture of Young this afternoon.
I am positive he is the man who pur
chased the revolver from me."
STORY TOLD BY DOOLEY.
Mrs. Patterson appeared confident.
She returned to her cell in the Tombs
believing that her release would soon
come.
Garvan. representing the District At
torney, said an adjournment of the ex
amination was necessary for a proper
presentation of the facts. Levy de
manded an immediate hearing, but
consented to an adjournment until Fri
day if moderate bail would be ac
cepted. Garvan said he would be sat
isfied If Mrs. Patterson furnished $10,
000. Coroner Brown reduced the
amount to $5000 and by so doing awak
ened the ire of District Attorney Je
rome. Later It was announced that no
bail would be accepted, and this re
suited in a writ of habeas corpus
which will bring on a conflict in court
to-morrow and which may result in
prompt and sensational action by the
District Attorney.
A bond trill be offered for the release
of the woman to-morrow, and if this
is refused her release on a writ of
habeas corpus will be urged. This
move forces the hand of District At
torney Jerome, end he will vigorously
combat the writ. He will urge that
Mrs. Patterson be held without bail
until Friday, when he will be ready to
go on with the examination.

The Yuma project, in Southern Cali
fornia is one of the most Important of
the several projects now under way.
J. B. Lipplncott Is supervising engineer
of all the work of the department in
California. Mr. Newell is now in Cali
fornia looking over the work so far
as it has progressed. It will probably
be three Years before . this enterprise
is completed.
Each proiect has its own resident en
gineer. He prepares the first plans A
board of consulting engineers goes over
these on the ground. If approved they
are submitted to the chief engineer and
If accepted by, him are submitted final
ly to the Secretarv of the Interior.
The reclamation service claims with
some pride to be modeled upon the
military service in its discipline as well
as Its formation and procedure, but
its battles are waged chiefly In the ap
propriations committee on Capitol Hill
and Its victories are those of peace.
The Truckee project in Nevada will
probably be the first of the Beveral
enterprises completed. It, however, is
only the first in a comprehensive sys
tem bv which some 3,000,000 acres will
be watered. The system contemplates
the diversion of the Humboldt, Carson,
Truckee and Walker rivers. None of
these rivers now flow to the sea, but
are lost in what are known as the
Humboldt and Carson sinks. Thev will
be tapped high above these sinks,
turned one into the other and led out
over the thirsty land.
.As illustrating the thoroughness of the
work of the survey the Yuma project is
an example. The land to be.irrigated Is
in California, but for this purpose the
waters of the Grande River in Colo
rado, one of the principal tributaries
of the Colorado River, is to be stored.
The dam site is at Kremmling and Is
1200 miles from Yuma. The waters
are to be allowed to flow down this
long distance during the periods of low
water on the lower Colorado. This dis
trict dam Bite was chosen after very
careful investigation had shown there
was no available site on the main
stream. '
There, is a little army or over 350
men in the Held engaged in this work
under th^ immediate direction of F. H.
Newell, chief engineer, geological sur
vey, who Is of course under the Secre
tary of the Interior. The region they
work over Includes an area of 1,333,000
square miles. They have for years
been measuring the streams every
where available for irrigation pur
poses, making notes of the topography
of the land, investigating the water
under as well as upon the earth and
in every way providing the department

J. B. LIPPINCOTT, ENGINEER IN
CHARGE OF RECLAMATION
WORK IN CALIFORNIA.
Showing little the effect of the forty
hours ehe had spent in the Tombs,
"Nan" Patterson appeared in the Cor
oner's court to-day. None of her
friends were with her. but she was
supported by her counsel, "Abe" Levy.
The proceedings In court were brief.
It became known to-day that when,
last Saturday, the learned that Young,
with his wife, intended sailing for
Europe, "Nan" Patterson prepared to
f^low them. It is paid that she even
went so far as to arrange for passage
on one ef the Fteamships sailing from
New York to-morrow.
In her letter to him *he said that she
would not let him leave ner. Again she
spoke of being desperate enough for
any act when she thought of being
separated.
Assistant District Attorney Ganvan
also has in his porsession an affidavit
made by William Luse. the brother-in
law of Young. Luse says Young was
threatened by "Nan" Patterson and
waiÂ» in fear of her. Young had written
several letters to the woman and it was
to obtain- possession of them that he
saw her last Friday night and again
early Saturday morning.
Detectives have reported to the As
sistant District Attorney that the re
volver used to kill Young had been Bold
from the establishment of Shoverling,
Daly & Gales, at 202 Broadway. Jos
eph Gales said to-night he had reason
for believing the revolver was one of
a lot sect to a San Francisco retailer.
If that Is the case the work </t the de
tectives will be greatly simplified.
HKARING IS ADJOURNED.
One of thp letters that w?-re written
by "Nan" Patterson to Young shows
that the actress was much distressed
at the prospect of separating. "Nan"
Patterson was to have Eailed for Eu
rope early last month. Passage for
h^r was engaged and paid for by
Young, but at the last moment she re
fused to go unless he would go with
her.
James J. Dooley, a young deck hand
on a steamboat, to-night informed
Henry W. Unger. counsel for Mrs. Pat
tÂ»-rtion, that he sold to Young the re
volver with which the shooting was
rtcne. Dooley's story was told in a
6traJg-htforward manner and it is ap
parent that he is truthful, but the cir
cumstances would seem to prove that
he :.- mfi taken and that the revolver he
disposed of is not the one in the prea
t-nt case.
Dr. Phillip O. Hanlon, the Coroner's
physician, who made the post mortem
examination of the body of Young,
To-nipht made a statement In which he
said the wound could have been in
flicted by Young only if the revolver
had been pushed far to the left and the
trigger pressed with Young's thumb.
The make of the revolver is such thiit
it Is impossible for it to be discharged
in the manner described by Dr. Han
lon. Moreover, a revolver held in the
way the description says Young must
have held the weapon to commit sui
cide could by no possibility have left
powder marks on the fingers, though
the powder might have burned the
thumb. No powder marks were on
Young's thumb.
LETTERS CONTAIN' THREATS.
NEW YORK, June 6.â Light may be
thrown to-morrow upon the ownership
Â¦jf the revol\er with which "Caesar"
Ycung was Fbot. Detectives have
traced th<? revolver from the manufac
turer to the retailer and there are good
irasons for believing the ownership of
tte weapon will be established.
AESistact District Attorney Garvan
is so certain that this important eri
cence will be obtained that he could
not restrain his elation to-night,
i hough he refused to discuss the sub
ject for publication.
Sptclal DU^atch to TnÂ» Call
PARIS, June 6.â Referring to the dis
patch from Malaga, saying that the
Spanish battleships Pelaya and Nu
mancia and the armored cruiser Cls
neros had sailed for Tangier, the For
eign Office here says it received a de
nial of a similar report previously pub
lished, but is not aware whether the
warships have gone to Morocco.
The rumors current in Madrid to-day
that the powers have exchanged notes
relative to restricting American opera
tions in Morocco are discredited by the
Foreign Office. â¢ -
LONDON, June 6.â The fears ex
pressed at Madrid that the action of
the United States in sending a fleet to
Tangier was due to the American de
sire for a port on the west coast of
Morocco, and the rumors at the Span
ish capital of an exchange of notes
between the European powers, with the
view to obtaining assurance that the
American action will be confined to
liberating Perdlcarls and Varley, are
not shared and are not confirmed at
the Spanish Embassy here. The Span
ish Government appears to be acting in
perfect harmony with Great Britain
and the United States and no "appre
hension is expressed in official circles
that the United States has any designs
except to insure the safety of Perdi
caris and American citizens.
C RUMOR IS DISCREDITED.
The Navy Department sees no oc
casion to diminish the naval force at
Tangier, notwithstanding that several
suggestions that such a course would
be beneficial have appeared in the Eu
ropean press. However, this has been
left In the hands of Admiral Chad-,
wick. Â¦ Â¦
SPAIN NOT APPREHENSIVE.
The feeling prevails at the State De
partment that yesterday marked the
crisis In Tangier, so far as it relates
to the possibility of a Moorish uprising
growing out of the large foreign fleet
in the harbor.
GIBRALTAR. June 6.â The British
battleship Prince of Wales will sail for
Tangier to-morrow. The other ships
of: the' British Mediterranean squad
ron, whlch> were to have sailed for
Italy fo-day, have been ordered to re"
main here. It is reported that the
French Mediterranean squadron Is on
its way to Tangier.
WASHINGTON. June 6.â Rear Ad
miral Chadwick, in a cablegram to the
Navy Department to-day, said tliat the
British Minister at Morocco had re
quested the British Government to send
a' battleship to Tangier, and gave the
information that the Sultan of Morocco
was expected to arrive at Tangier. The
admiral advised the department, fur

LOUISVILLE. Ky.. June 6. â Reve
| nue Agent August W. Blzot to-day re
j newed. by filing another suit, the pro
i ceedings inaugurated by William Wel
â¢ ler Jr. during his term as revenue
agent against the Southern Pacific
I Railroad Company for bac k taxes on
; property worth $90,000,000. The
'actual amount in litigation is $3,000,
: 000, being taxe-s at an average rate
i of TO cents on the hundred upon a
i $90,000,000 property for five years.
The suit instituted by Agent Weller
resulted in a compromise, the com
pany agreeing to pay taxes to the ex
tent of $312,000. Weller prayed the
recovery of only $1,000,000, while
Bizot asks for $3,050,000. The differ
ence arises out of the difference of
; conception of the defendant's liability.
\ Bizot contends that the Southern Pa
j cific is a holding company and that as
: its holdings are in Kentucky it must
pay taxes here on Its holdings every
where, including steamboat, steamship
and railway lines over the world at
I large. As to the conpromise effected
! by Weller, Bizot says:
"The Court of Appeals decided in
the case of the city vs. the Louisville
Railway Company that a compromise
of a tax suit operates only as a credit
and that no taxes can be compromised
; so as to settle the claim except par- I
tially, to the extent that the amount
; paid sets off the amount due."

the Capital of Morocco
The law creating the reclamation
service providing for these great Irri
gation enterprises, which are designed
tn cover the entire arid regions so far
as that Is possible, was passed June 17.
1902. and is due to President RooseVelt
and his interest and knowledge of the
situation more than to any other man
or Instrumentality. The whole Western
country was thrilled with the possibili
ties as presented at that time. The
average layman, however, viewed ' the
undertakings as a matter of. decades
rather than years before they could be
expected to bear fruit. They did i not
know that for twenty-six years the
Geological Survey, with" Its hydro
graphic division, had been taking and
storing away careful notes of the. face
of- nature with this very law.' In mind.
T. W. Powell, at the head of that de
partment for nearly a quarter of a cen
tury, ia referred to as the father of
irrigation In this country. So that the
very day following the passage of the
act â so had preparations been made â
men were sent into the field to begin
the practical work contemplated by the
law. They knew Just what , of the
parched and barren regions it was best
to relieve in the first attack, and just
about where the dams could be built
to the best advantage. And this ac
counts for the great progress that has
North Dakotaâ Fort Bedford project,
taking water from Yellowstone River
in Montana, cost $1,200,000.
Oregon â Malheur "project, costing
J2.000.000.
Utahâ Conservation of water In Utah
Lake at cost of about *' 000,000.
Washington â Reclamation of land
nenr Posco. cost about $1,000,000.
Wyoming â Storage and diversion ot
Shoshone River near Cody, for which
$2,250,000 Is allotted.
Nevada â Truckee - Carson project,
now under construction, to cost about
$3,000,000.
New Mexicoâ Hondo project, 'to cost
$350,000. â¢ - -.
So the more you look at this enter
prise of the Government the more
pleasing and inspiring it is. Moved by
it, the question at once occurs, "How
are lands to be secured under the law
that is to work this charm?" The an
swer is simply "the homestead law" â
the homestead law modified. The num
ber of acres that may be taken up by
Individuals varies according to cli
mate, soil and other conditions. The
Secretary of the Interior fixes the unit
under each project upon reports made
to him as to these conditions. They
run from .160 acres to forty acres. For
it will be seen that forty acres of irri
gated land in California, for instance,
is more attractive to a settler than ICO
acres would be In some remote part of
Arizona. The settler must agree to pay
the cost of the improvement. The
Government agents assess this propor
tionately over all the land benefited. It
is to be paid In ten annual payments.
This assessment represents the exact
cost and with no interest. Of course,
the cost is not the same in any two
cases, nor is the area benefited the
same, all of which raises Interesting
questions that must be met by the in
dividual and that make no part of this
story. This story is of the magnificent
enterprise and much more magnificent
results in bulk. Seeing that the Gov
ernment is put to it to reclaim the des
ert for the reason that there ia need of
it, there will be little disposition to
quibble among the beneficiaries. In
truth the. anxiety is on the other hand.
It no sooner becomes known that an
irrigation district is to be formed than
settlers rush In and file upon the land,
thereby taking every chance of throw
ing away their rights. For the law
requires that water must be put upon
the land within one year from the date
of filing and in no instance can -the
Government do this. Government
agents are continually warning settlers
of the conditions and of the risk they
take In making filings or settling upon
lands prematurely. The Secretary of
the Interior will give due notice when
entries may be made with safety. The
works now determined upon are as fol
lows:
Arizona â Salt River project, where
$3,000,000 is to be expended.
California â So-called Yuma project,
on the Colorado River, to cost $3,000,000.
Colorado â Uncompahgre project to
cost $2,000,000.
Idaho â Minidoka project, for which
$2,600,000 Is allotted.
Montanaâ Milk River project, to cost
$1,500,000.
But the four millions placed upon
profitable farming lands and the other
millions in the towns or cities created
as a result only form .a part of the
picture. There is in the first place the
imrriense impulse given to manufac
tures in supplying tools and equip
ment; there is the impulse to railroad
building in the development of the
co-untry and in the distribution of the
product of these fruitful fields. With
the extension of railroads a thousand
mining enterprises that wait upon
them will come into being.
Every one of the Irrigation projects
of the Government contemplates the
generation of electric power far beyond
its own needs or the needs of the fartn
ers. This will aid the mirier and the
manufacturer. So it will be seen that
the "Reclamation Service." which came
into being only two years ago, is en
gaged in a big and beneficent work.
The $27,000,000â the first cpst of the
work now under way â Is the govern
mental loan to prosecute the work as
planned in twelve States and Territo
ries. This money, so it is arranged by
law, will be paid back to the Govern
ment 'by those who take up the land
under the provisions of the law and
then the Government will straightway
spend It again on other reclamation
undertakings, for which reconholssance
is already being made. And when
these other works are completed and
the money they cost returned It will be
spent again on still other works. And
so the reclamation service will con
tinue widening the area of bloom In the
desert until there Is no desert, or at
least no further waters with Which to
reclaim It.
A PLEASING VIEW.
CALL BUREAU. HOTEL BARTON.
WASHINGTON,. June 6.â The twenty
seven million dollars to be sown through
the arid regions of the West by the
Government in irrigation work will, it
is estimated, cause a hundred million
acres of the desert to turn bountiful,
to give, pfosperous place to four- mil
lion people, to warrant the building of
cities c/f a population double that num
ber. And the works upon which -this
money is to be expended are expected
to be completed within four years as
the outer limit. Some of them will be
completed .within two years. It* is a
very moving picture, therefore, that is
presented to the mind with this ener
getic work in progress in the West.
The value of this vast area of land
is now nil. With the work completed
and the water turned on, a value will
have been created averaging $43 an
acre, or $4,300,000,000. As for the cost
of the vast improvements making all
this possible, expfffts say that the value
of the first crop >aken from the land
will match it.

The taking of testimony in the case
of the International Banking Company
against Jacob Eppinger, charged with
obtaining money on worthless ware
house receipts, began in Judge Law
lor's court yesterday morning. Almost
the entire morning session was occu
pied with a â¢ dispute' between the at
torneys regarding the admissibility of
certain papers. When the hour for the
noon recess arrived Judge Lnvlor cre
ated a mild sensation by ordering the
jury into the custody of the Sheriff.
It is but a short time since a juror
in Lawlor's court .claimed that an at
tempt had been made to bribe him,
and it is probably in view of this fact
that the Judge ordered the jurors. Into
safe keeping. The taleamen plainly
showed their dissatisfaction, but there
was no open rebellion until the close
of the afternoon session, when one/ of
the jurors arose and asked the court
if it was necessary for him to take
tea and milk with his meals when wine
was more agreeable. The Judge passed
the question up to the attorneys, and
by consent the juror will be allowed
his wine.
COLONEL BECK TESTIFIES.

Various contracts were awarded for
eupplies for the City Hospital, Alms
house, Department of Health. Eraer
frÂ»ncy Hospitals, Twenty-sixth street
hospital, county jails and Department
tÂ»f Electricity.
The recommendation of the Health
Committee that the contract to furnish
cauze to the City Hospital be awarded
to a concern not the lowest bidder was
re-referred to the committee upon Box
tTi's protest. that the charter provision
phould be complied with. The amount
es bid was slightly in excess of the
lowest proposal.
PROTEST OUTRAGEOUS.
A resolution Was adopted denying the
request of the Board of Public Works
for permission to utilize an unexpended
bwlanrp of $2330 in the fund of the of
lice of superintendent of buildings to
repair streets. Action was taken on
the report of the Finance Committee
that the board had no richt to deviate
from the provisions of the budget.
An ordinance was passed to print or
dering the improving of Vallejo street,
between Battery and Front; Steven
son street, between Annie and Third;
Jessie street, between New Montgom
ery and Second; Minna street, between
Third (and Fourth, and Hayes street,
between Larkin and Van Ness avenue,
at a cost of $21,700.
T'le school lot at Twentieth and Ken
tucKy streets was transferred to the
Fire Department ar.d a fire engine
house will be erected thereon.
An ordinance making It unlawful to
beat ct sweep carpets or rugs upon any
eidewalk or street except between 12
o'clock midnight and 8 o'clock a. m.
was passed to print.

The roadway of Pierce street, be

re?ult of a protest filed.
The Board of " .'orks was directed
to notify the owners of certain street
obstructions removed to the corpora-'
tion yard to redeem the same or the
property will be sold at public auc
tion.
The Board of Supervisors yesterday
referred to the City Attorney for his
opinion as to its validity a proposed
ordinance describing a proposal to
amend the charter so that the Board
of Education shall have power to lease
Bchool property for fifty years with
the proviso that the cost of the Im
provements shall be no less than the
appraised value of the realty.
Brauhhart explained that the amend
ment was designed to give the Board
of Education the power to lease the
Lincoln School lots at Market and
Fifth streets for a period of fifty years
Instead of twenty as at present, so as
to permit of the erection of a building
to cost an amount equal to the value
of the lot. which would be unadvisable
under a shorter lease. (
The Mayor whs authorized to ap
point a Citizens' Committee of twenty
five to make arrangements for the
celebration of the Fourth of July.
A resolution was adopted giving no
tice to all those having demands
against the city to file them at an
early date in July so they may be
audited within the statutory time.
The ordinance regulating the sale of
calves for human food and making It
unlawful to sell any calf unless it is

BEATING OF CARPETS.
The budget provides the sum of $446,
900 for street Improvements, which
amount is Included in the total appro-
ITEMS IXBUDGET.
. The ordinance will now, go. to Mayor
Schmitz, who has ten days within
which to veto any specific appropria
tion. Should he veto any Item It will
take the votes of fifteen Supervisors
to override his disapproval. Should his
vetoes be sustained the appropriation
so vetoed will cause a corresponding
reduction In the total amount . of ex
penditures and result in . a . lower tax
rate than that fixed by .< the terms. of
the. original ordinance. ,
"I want to notify this board," said
the Mayor, before the budget was fin
ally passed, "that I disapprove , of a
number of the items in this, budget
and I shall exercise my power, of -veto
thereon." Â¦ Â¦. Â¦ 'Â¦ s '.'Â¦-.
"The Board of Works desires to say
that the Board of Supervisors must
bear the responsibility for street
sweeping If done Improperly," said the
Mayor. "If you want the streets to be
swept better than under contract you
must give them the sum of $290,000 they
have asked for."
Mayor Schmitz stated that the Board
of Works wanted it distinctly under
stood that it would be Impossible for
the city to clean the streets satisfac
torily for $215,000 in view of the fact
that the laborers would have to be
paid $2 50, or 25 cents a day more than
under contract, and that the "gangs"
would be increased from three to five
men.
A resolution from the Fife Commis
sion was read ordering the closing of
engine houses Nos. 5. 9 and 24, because
of insufficient funds to put them in
sanitary condition.
Brandenstein said the board would
not be intimidated by the departments
into changing any appropriations and
that the "filibustering tactics might
continue until the infernal regions
freeze over." He asked his colleagues
not to consider any resolutions of the
kind introduced and was called to or
der by the Mayor, who said he had no
right to question the right of any mem
ber to introduce a resolution;
Lunstedt's motion that consideration
of the budget be postponed until re
ceipt of a letter from the Board of
Works was lost by the previous vote.
"I have no desire to antagonize this
board by my power of veto," said the
Mayor, "but there have been certain
recommerdatlrrns made which I believe
should be accepted. If the claims made
for the Fire, Police and School depart
ments are ignored I shall be compelled
to veto certain items in the budget, as
that is my only alternative. The fire
men should be given one dny off each
week and the School Department
should not be hampered."
D'Ancona stated that the School
Board was given $116,000 more than
last year. The Mayor said that an al
leged surplus of $108,000 was reckoned'
in that amount which does not exist.
D'Ancona said that the money had
been received from the 'State to pay
teachers' salaries and if any of it had
been used for contracts It had been
done illegally. D'Ancona figured that
as the charter allowed $32 50 for each
of the 23,352 pupils attending the
schools the department was entitled to
$1,278,940. and under the new appro
priation, even excluding the surplus of
$108,000, the department would receive
$1,278,000. or within $940 of the limit
SHIFTS RESPONSIBILITY.
Lunstedt's resolution to make the ap
propriation for cleaning the streets
$Â£10,000 instead of $215,000 was defeated
by the same vote.
TO CliOSK ENGINE HOUSES.
Noes â Brandenstein, Braunhart,
Comte, Connor, D'Ancona, Eggers, Mc-
Clellan. Hocks. Payot, Rock and San
derson; 11.
Boxton made sarcastic reference to
the debate on the terms of his resolu
tion, even before it was read, calling
his colleagues "a lot of mind readers."
Boxton held that the charter provided
that the budget should be passed on
the last Monday in June, not necessar
ily by ordinance, as insisted uoon by
the Finance Committee, but by a ma
jority vote of the Supervisors.
Boxton's resolution was defeated un
der suspension. of the rules by the fol
lowing vote:
Ayes â Alpers. Bent, Boxton, Finn,
Lunstedt and Rca; 6.
"If the gag law is to be enfqrced
here," said Lunstedt, '"it is about time
we know it. I have also a resolution
to offer that may affect this budget."
Braunhart took exception to what he
called an attempt to draw political
lines and argued that if the budget
were not finally passed at once it
would be attacked by some tax shirk
ers. Braunhart favored an extra holi
day for firemen, but wanted to know
what had become of the $7500 set aside
last year to give the firemen five days
more vacation.
Supervisor Boxton started the ball
rolling by submitting a resolution
striking out $75,000 of the $150,000 ap
propriated for Twin Peaks auxiliary
water supply, $7500 for a public conven
ience station at Fifth street, near Mar
ket, and $7500 for an elevator In the
City Hall and giving to the School De
partment $50,000, to the Fire Depart
ment $25,000 to give firemen one day off
in a week and to the Police Depart
ment $15,000 to pay for twelve addition
al patrolmen.
Brandenstein objected to the consid
eration of the resolution, saying that
the matter of the budget was ended,
that it was on submission and up for
final passage and no changes could be
made.
OBJECTS TO GAG LAW. .
The ordinance was not finally passed
until several efforts had been made to
change some of the appropriations in
the interest of several departments.
The ordinance was finally passed by
the fifteen affirmative votes of Super
visors Alpers, Bent, Braunhart, Bran
denstein, Comte. Connor, d'Ancona, Eg
grers, Finn, Hocks, McClellan, Payot,
Rea, Rock and Sanderson, after the
heads of the various departments had
been heard regarding their petitions for
larger appropriations. The two nega
tive votes came from Supervisors Box
ton and Lunntedt. Booth was absent.
The Board of Supervisors yesterday
finally passed, exactly as It was passed
to print, the ordinance designating
specific appropriations for expenditures
aggregating 57,394.836 in the next mu
nicipal budget and fixing the tax rate
for city purposes for the fiscal year
1904-1905 at $1.2053 on every $100, based
on an estimated assessed valuation of
$465,000,000.

Meaning of the Statute
Dr. Theodore Burnham Ad
mits Speaker's Eemarks to
Be as Good as Any Sermon
The defendants In error admit that the
business of Importing lumber from the Stats
of Washington Into the city of Portland may
bÂ« affected by the combination, but they say
that the result Is due not to their combination
to refuse to sell to purchasers in the city of
Portland who make such Importations, but to
the Inability of the "Washington, milts ti> sup
ply the Portland market with klln-drled or
finishing lumber and that the combination ts
not the direct and proximate cause of th<Â»
Inability of the Washington mills to sell lum
ber In the city of Portland. But that very In
ability Is one of the essential facts which aid
to create the situation which Is complained
of. â¢ â¢ â¢ But for the existence of that
fact It Is safe to assert that the combination
would not have beÂ«n formed. â¢ â¢ â¢
Does the fact that the wholÂ« combination
and Us success are made possible by the ad
ventitious circumstance that no one has yet
seen fit to Invest the capital necessary to es
tablish a competing plant at Vancouver render
the restraint of Interstate commerce effected by
the combination any the less direct and neces
sary? If such Is the law It follows that to
secure Immunity for every such a combination
It Is necessary only to bring Into It all man
ufacturers of Its line of goods, and to intrench
It behind the proposition that the resulting
restraint of trade comes not from the combina
tion, but from the Inability of others to supply
the market. The mÂ«-e statement of the prop
osition is Its refutation.
Another trust in restraint of trads
was put out of business yesterday by
the United States Circuit Court of Ap
peals. The case is that of Arthur S.
Ellis vs. Inman Poulson & Co.. North
Pacific Lumber Company, Eastern
and Western Lumber Company and tha
City Retail Lumber Company.
Ellis is a contractor and housebuilder
doing business in Portland. Oregon. He
alleges in the complaint that on July
2. 1902, the other defendants organized
the City Retail Lumber Company for
the purpose of creating a monopoly of
the manufacture and sale of lumber,
of demanding unreasonable prices and
of preventing the public from purchas
ing from any dealers other than the
defendants. It is averred that in pur
suance of such conspiracy they refused
to sell to persons who purchased any
hlmber from Vancouver or elsewhere
outside of the combination. It Is
further averred that he bought a cer
tain quantity of rough lumber at Van
couver and had it delivered to him in
Portland at 1250 less than the amount
charged by the combine in Portland
and that when he offered to buy kiln
dried lumber of the combine, there be
ing none of that kind of lumber pro
duced in Washington, the combine re
fused to sell it to him. because he had
purchased the rough lumber at Wash
ington. Damages were demanded in
the sum of $8500. The lower court de
cided against Ellis on the ground that
the combine had not restrained the
lumber trade between Oregon and
Washington for the reason that kiln
dried lumber was not "produced in the
last named State. The Circuit Court
of Appeals reversed this decision, say
ing, among other things:

"The Man and the Ship" was the
subject of an address by G. W. Dickie,
manager of the Union Iron Works, be
fore the Presbyterian Ministers' Asso
ciation yesterday morning. The Rev.
H. M. Bevier presided. Mr. Dickie
said, in part:
A man, like a Â¦hip, may have Inherently
great stability of character, his rmstacenter
far above his center of gravity. In all ordi
nary conditions of life he maintains an uprlsht
position, and if smooth water prevailed all
through bis life experience his character .will
be admired and others will point to him as a
finÂ© example of uprightness and stability.
But let him get out Into the open sea amia
the storms of life, where waves are high ana
gTeat forces oppose themselves to htm and his
ways; It Is then that his stability often de
generates Into mere stubbornness; his righting
moment Is too great; Instead of rolling gently
to the Irresistible waves that beset him and
swinging gracefully back again to the upright
position â¢ when the wave has spent Its force,
we find him gathering all the power of his
stability to fight against the natural forces
around him. shipping huge seas In his des
perate efforts to maintain his upright position.
And should the storm continue he Is apt to go
down, a martyr to his own faith In Inherent
stability or sense of what is right.
NEEDS STRUCTURAL STRENGTH.
No man;' like the Â«hip. depends very much
od structural strength. If he does not start
out with a sound body, which Is the hull that
must carry all his means of offense and de
fense, he Is apt to be worsted In the struggle
A good constitution for the man Is to him
what structural strength Is to the man-of
war; and If he starts In life with such a
precious possession he must be careful to pre
serve It. Â¦ "
In man, like a. man-of-war, the propelling
power Is of great Importance. As the propel
ling: power Is the heart of the battleship,
from which she obtains life, so the man's
heart Is the propelling power of his life- v
If he be fitted with a well-balanced triple
expansion heart and he leaves his training
port, the protected home harbor where he was
built and fitted out, with all his reserve bunk
ers full of the best hand-picked fuel, and his
ready service bunkers full of sound principles,
he need fear no enemy, provided he does not
waste the precious contents of his bunkers In
useless excitement, rulninir his boilers by
forced draught, straining his engines for the
sole purpose of making a bijr wave in society.
If this Is the record of his sea service the
evenlwr may find him with empty bunkers and
a weathered heart.
Dr. Theodore F. Burnham said that
Mr. Dickie's address was as good as
any sermon and on the motion of Dr.
Herrlott a vote of thanks was given the
speaker.

The aquatic sports at Sausalito Sun
day were witnessed by a large num
ber of spectators. The affair was held
under the auspices of the San Fran
cisco -Yacht Club and as usual was a
great success. The programme was
scheduled to commence at 10:30.
Promptly at that time Announcer

and contests proved highly interesting:.

Wise finished second. The members of
the San Francisco Yacht Club then
took to the water and swam 100 yards.
Winslow L. Beedy was first and James

tained three oarsmen and a coxswain.
The winners In this event were Captain

craft proved exciting. There were six
crews in the contest. W. W. Farrar
and Dr. Levinsky, with Mrs. Farrar as
coxswain, won by two lengths.
The climbing of the greasy pole was
attempted by many, but Hardy Hellen
was the only successful contestant. The

jnethod to gain this end will be very
simple. His first -attack will begin at
Vorden, on the Sacramento River,
where 100 acres of corn land have been
put at his disposal. There he will grow
various kinds of corn for the purpose
of. ascertaining what kind of corn the
worm, likes best. As soon as this is
determined more of the corn to the
worrrTs liking will be grown In an iso
lated field, where it is hoped to con
fine him until the clean crop is har
vested: In a word, it Is a campaign
to isolate the pest. In every field of
corn after this year there will always
be one patch where the insect will flock

In time it is hoped that the worm
will bo exterminated. The difficulty
about it now is that the worm cannot
be killed oft by sprays because he is in
side the hnslf , where he is safe. But
the scientists, are not despairing, and
they hope some day to find a way to
put him to rout.
He is the first thing that appears
after the husk has been taken off the
corn,' and he is an ugly thing to look
upon. Usually he has eaten half the
kernels on : the! cob and there is' little
left for the table. The corn worm's
greatest fault is that, he reduces the
market value of- all the corn grown in
the State one-half, and It is to get rid
of h!m that the scientists at the Uni
versity of California are laying .out a
campaign. â¢
Science is about to make its first at
tack upon the corn . wormâ that de
structive little insect'that has been the
bane of the lives .of hundreds of farm
ers in California who raise the vege
table for the market. This' insect Is
familiar to all housewives who have
supplied the table with the succulent
food. . '

â¢ The majority of the committee, under
the leadership of Atherton and the reg
ular secretary, Lawrence Hyde, kept
on doing business and put in a petition
to the board. So far as the name on
the ballot went, both asked for the
same thing, and it could have been
granted, but â¢ the recognition of either
faction would give it a right to appoint
delegates and it was here, that the real
point of the trouble appeared. The
time, however, was passing for some
action to be taken and the two sides
have seen the necessity of settling diffi
culties and announced to-day that this
would be done.
The trouble arose when .the Union
Labor Central Committee, at a meet
ing held last April, deposed Chairman
J. B. Crandall and elected A. W. Ath
ertorr in his stead. Crandall took five
members of the committee with him
and organized a new committee of
which he is chairman and R.. J. Silva
was elected secretary. They then Ailed
the other vacancies on the committee
and presented a petition to the Board
of Supervisors to allow the name of the
Union Labor party to go on the regular
ballot. â¢
After several weeks of -fighting be
tween two factions of the Union Labor
party,. both. of which claimed to be the
only County Central Committee, it was
announced before the Board of Super
visors to-day that it was probable that
the. trouble could be amicably patched
up.

All of the stolen merchandise was re
covered. H. K. Jackson, head of the
company, declared he would not pros
ecute Wendt and that ho purposed to
give the young man opportunity to re
deem himself.
Quantities of cutlery, lace curtains
and blankets stolen from the Jackson
Furniture Company. 523 Twelfth street,
tfere recovered to-day by Detective
Quigley, who arrested Albert Wendt, a
clerk In the firm's employ, and charged
him with larceny.
Wendt confessed his guilt and said
he had taken the wares to get money
to Bpend with women. Wendt told the
police that he had served a term of a
year in the military prison at Alcatraz
Island as a deserter from the United
States army. . ,
Members of the firm were astonished
to-day when . Quigley informed them
that a lot of their stock had been sto
len and that Wendt was the thief.
When the detective said he would ar
rest Wendt there was indignation ex
pressed that the police should interfere.
Nevertheless, Wendt was taken into
custody and after he had told his story
was registered' for larceny.

Special Instructors Dis
missed and Resignations of
Two Others Are Accepted
Sir William Ramsay, the greatest
chemist in the world, will pot offer In
struction to students at the summer
Fchool of the University of California
this year. Quite unexpectedly the
wizard-scientist lias announced that he
will be detained in London all through
the summer by a scientific exigency
that suddenly arose while he was pre
paring to come to California.
i In a letter Just received by Professor
L,eon J. Richardson, dean of the sum
mer school. Sir William expresses his
great regret at thus being compelled to
disappoint many students intending to
attend his lectures at Berkeley and
asking to be relieved from. his obliga
tion. He does r.ot specify the nature
of the scientific cjuestion that will de
tain him, but it is thought to con
cern his researches into the phenomena
of xadio-activity, to which he has been
devoting much of his attention lately.
Sir William's withdrawal at this time
will surely disappoint and upset the
plans of hundreds of Intending stu
dents eager to work under the direc
tion of suc-h a notable scientist. Sir
William, with Professor Hugo de Vries,
the greatest botanist; Professor Svante
Arrhenius, the greatest physicist, and
Dr. Jacques Loeb, the greatest biolo
gist, was counted upon to complete the
greatest auartet of world-famous sci
entists ever gathered together at a uni
versity summer school. His loss will
be severely felt, for the time is too
short now to get another to fill his
place.

he gave out the statement that his
body would be found near Fort Point.

Dr. Hemphill left here about six
months ajro to till temporarily th<Â» pul
pit of the principal Presbyterian
church in Sydney and incidentally to
benefit his health. He won warn) favor
with eclonial ehureh-eoers, and ovory
time the "American minister"
preached, pay people who crossed on
the Ventura, hundreds were turned
away from the church doors. Dr. and
Mrs. Hemphill Epeak in glowing terms
of the kindnoss with which they were
Treated. The pleasure of it all. how
ever, was somewhat marred by the
reading of the newspaper clipping re
ceived at Honolulu.
Whon the doctor said yesterday that
ho was home to fia:ht he straightened
out his athletic frame as if he coulu.
and there was a glint in his eyes that
FUggested he might enjoy it. His first
move will be to locate the black sheep
of the Calvary flock whose bleating, the
doctor believes, inspired the shower of
tnud.

Hcv. Dr. John Hemphill, pastor of
Calvary Presbyterian Church of this
city, Â¦who. accompanied by Mrs. Hemp
hill, returned from Australia, yesterday
on the liner Ventura, has mapped out
for himself a, vigorous campaign of
vindication. The doctor received at
Honolulu a copy of a local paper con
taining an article in which Calvary
?Church treasury was depicted as being
empty and the pastor's extravagance
Â«.ited as a contributory cause. It was
puggrested that Dr. Hemphlll's absence
vouid probably be permanent.
Like a jrood general, the doctor de
tiines to reveal his plan of campaign,
but makes no bones about stating the
objects he intends to accomplish. lie

â¢ Xylography was first employed in
the Bervice of religion for reproducing

was followed by the production of pub

r-r*\ HE conference at Lake Mohonk on international
I arbitration is intended to define and prepare the
-*â¢ American position that will be urged upon the in
ternational conference at St. Louis. That position will
favor arbitration treaties between all countries, with a
view to progressive disarmament.
It is believec 1 that this country has now reached such
a position among the powers of the world that its choice
and advice in the matter will influence them all. This re
sult is directly aided by the warnings sounded by cer
tain French and German publicists against what they
call the ambitious designs of the United States. If their
governments believe the alarm to be well grounded,
and that we are a power to be reckoned with, they will
be all the more ready to. attend a greater conference
than The Hague, in which the work that followed the
Czar's call will receive its necessary supplement.
While it cannot be admitted that the analogy between
the disputes of nations and the disputes of individuals
is complete, yet the parity is sufficient to justify the in
stitution of just and lawful methods -for the settlement
of most of the international disputes' Individuals form
erly settled all differences by personal combat N In those
days the physically weak had no rights because they
could not defend them. When a system of jurisprudence
arose and law and justice were judicially enforced, the
strong and weak were equalized, and the weak were
panoplied with protection for their rights. Observation
compels the admission that a large part of the causes of
war between nations can be subjected to ' the same
process by arbitration, Â£nd war will thereafter have its
principal excuse only in the refusal of the loser to abide
by the" judgment.
As there is no higher judicial tribunal than the arbi
tral court, the only appeal from it will be to arms. Un
less the appellant nation have a very strong case the
world's sympathy will be denied it. We incline to the
opinion that the Mohonk plan, if carried out, will elimi
nate war as far as that desirable result can be obtained. :

m yr R. CUNLIFF-OWEN publishes in Munsey's a
J\/\ somewhat hysterical appeal to the Christian
1 Y 1. world against Japan in view of "the yellow, peril"
which will follow the defeat of Russia in the present
struggle. The writer says that "if Japan is successful
she will rot repeat the mistake which she made at the
conclusion of her war with China, when she permitted the
European powers to rob her of the fruits of her victory.
She may be trusted to take advantage of the popular sen
timent in her behalf throughout Asia to carry matters
with a high hand." f
This naive confession that Japan was robbed, as she
was, and that being put on notice now she will not be
robbed as? in, does not seem to impress Mr. Cunliff-Owen
that the best way to avert any yellow peril, real or
fancied, will be by dealing justly with the Asiatics. The
United States has -dealt justly with Japan and the result
is her assimilation of our civilization. She has our pub
lic school system and our system of jurisprudence com
plete. The common law. except as modified by statutes,
is the law of Japan and her trained jurists are the peers
of any in this country or England. Suppose that Japan
ese influence shall raise Eastern Asia to the same level?
What peril is there in it? The Western world pretended
that it was for that purpose that it broke by force the
seclusion of China.
Mr. Cunliff-Owen's final appeal against Japan. is based
upon his statement that education has not entirely de
stroyed the belief of the people in the supernatural quality
of the Mikado. If he will go a little into Russia he will
find millions of the vodka soaked and soddenly ignorant
people firmly believing in the supernatural powers of the
Great Czar. Indeed, if superstition is to be the test, the
Russians suffer, for they are the only people in these days
that believe that charms and amulets and holy images
can protect a battleship or defend a city. Japan has done
more for the rise of Asia to a modern plane than all the
missionaries and all the Western natiofis combined. Let
Asia rise, let China be enlightened, and then let us treat
them justly, and there will be no peril.
JAPAN'S POLICY.
The vagaries of the American mind are hard to fol
low and extremely difficult to understand. Creditors of
Sully, the collapsed and throneless cotton king of New
York, are seeking to make the deed to a church pew an
asset of the chaotic affairs of the great gambler. And
the public must wonder what in the name of morality
Sully wanted with a church pew or what in common
sense his creditors will do with it if it can't be ne
gotiated. **"Â«
Still Reigning Queen.
ROME, May U.â Think of being able
t-> go to a first night and see, sitting
calmly In a boxâ Adelaide Ristori!
This !s a privilege that dwellers in
Rome enjoy, for the world famous Ital
ian actress, whom monarchs once vied
with each other in honoring, has lost
i:o whit cf her interest in the stage, of
which she still is queen, and rarely
misses a premiere. Although she is

The technique of Japanese engraving
and printing is thus described: The
picture, drawn for the engraver on thin
transparent paper of a particular kind,
is pasted face downward upon a block
of wood, usually cherry, and ths su
perfluous thickness of paper LÂ» removed
by a process of scraping until the da
sign is clearly visible. The* borders of
the outline are then lncls*!â very light
ly in the more delicate part*â witn a
kind of knife, and the Interspaces be
tween the lines of the drawing Â«xÂ»
finally excavated by means of tools of
various shapes.
The Ink Is then applied with a brash
and the printing -is effected by hand
pressure, assisted by a kind of pad, to
which procedure may ba attributed
much of the beauty of the result. Cer
tain graduations of tone, and evÂ«a
polychromatic effects, may bo pro
duced from a single block by suitable
application of ink or color upon the
wood; and on carefully examtnioff
these prints It is often apparent that
a great deal of artistic feeling has been
exercised In the execution of the picture
after the designer and engraver had
finished their portion of the work.
Fisherman's Luck.
Fishing is the quiet and eminently
respectable wing of sports which even
a Bishop can indulge without en
dangering his dignity and ecclesiasti
cal standing and probably that is the
reason why Louis H. Eaton, organist
at Trinity Church,' makes coquetting
with the tittlebat and flounder a spe
cial and ever recurring pleasure.
Whenever the organist can find the
time he hies himself to Tiburon and,
accompanied by a veteran boatman,
rows out toward Angel Island and
casts his lines well and temptingly
baited.
For Eaton to return to San Fran
cisco without the sign of a nsh would
be tantamount to daubing a blurring
blot on the family escutcheon.
A local wit, who is also a patient
fisherman, met Eaton recently en
route for San Francisco and in charge
of a bag weighted with the results
of a day's sport. \".^".,

but it occurred to him that it would
be a good joke on his friend were he
to change bags, and while Eaton was
glancing over the latest news of an
other Kuroki victory over Kuropat
kin the bags were changed. A lit

paper, remarked that the Russians
"My purest, unalloyed joy was in
Italy, where I man-ied. and where I
used my poor powers to further the

of my country. The supreraest com
pliment of my career came from
France, when .Napoleon III begged me
to study at the royal expense in Pari3
for a year and then take the place at
the Con:edie Francaise left vacant by
Mme. Rachel. Just think what an
honor, but I refused, as one of the con
ditions was that I should act only in
France, andâ I say it with prideâ Italy
needed me.
"The emotion I felt in Spain was
of another kind, pure pity and satis

THE CALL has published the statement of the flood
problem made by Mr. William H. Mills of the State
Board of Trade. It is an example of the profound
study and intelligent attention given by the members of
that organization to the great i hysical problems which
effect the material weifare of the State. Whether en
gineers agree v/'th its conclusions or not, they must all
admit that it presents concisely and forcibly the elements
of the situation with which engineering science must deal.
The floods, originating at altitudes running lip to 6ooo
feet, are rapidly delivered at a common point near tide
ltvel, where their progress is barred by the tidal opposi
tion. The flood water is in effect stored at that point by
tidal influence .and must wait on slow drainage into the
vein. The ov^rfkwea region becomes a reser%oir for
these arrested waters. The problem is different from
shutting out the ocean itself as in Holland. There it is
only necessary to levee against the sea and the influence
of tide and wind, and there are no great floods delivered
briskly from high altitude on the landward side to be
guarded against. In our valley that flood water is the
greater problem of the two.
Heretofore the treatment of our floods by draining them
into such depressions as' the Yolo basin has been pro
posed in recognition of the very, difficulties so plainly
stated by Mr. Mills. But when the flood water is in such
volume as to cover the valley from the foothills of the
Coast Range to the foothills of the Sierra Nevada it all
becomes a flood basin and depressions like the Yolo basin
are simply a part of the whole expanse.
For the purposes of treatment the flood waters that
come down the Sierra Nevada only may be considered.
If these are taken care of and held back from their pres
ent zero or meeting of the influence of the tides the
Coast Range water will not cause any appreciable dam
age. Therefore, we have to consider the control of that
world of water that falls upon the great range and runs
down its sides like rain off a roof. If that water can be
intercepted on the slope of the roof and kept from reach
ing the eaves there will be no floods in the valley, and the
zero point will be lifted to the new point of interception.
The floods of the McCloud, Pitt, Feather, Yuba, Bear
and American rivers, if diverted or arrested before
they reach the Sacramento, will not overtax the drainage
capacity of the lower reaches of that main stream where
it meets the obstructive effect of the tides. A grand
canal, beginning at an altitude sufficient for the purpose,
would intercept the floods, carry the water along the
foothills and distribute it to a system of reservoirs in
which it could be held for gradual discharge through the
season. These reservoirs would store water for irriga
tion and for power. If the diversion be at a point high
enough that water could even be carried in great pipes
or by open and elevated flumes to the west side of the
San Joaquin to bring into cultivation great areas that are
now uncertain in their yield for lack of irrigation.
Perhaps such a canal and reservoir system would have
to have the aggregate capacity of all the rivers it would
intercept.' The cost would be great. But if it be the only
means to effectively control the floods there is no choice
between its adoption and the wasteful expenditure of al
most equally great sums on plans made ineffective by the
very nature of the problem.
The great value of Mr. Mills' discussion of the ques
tion is its clear presentation of the confluence of all the
rivers in one great river, beginning at Suisun Bay and
emptying into the ocean at the Golden Gate. As he puts
it forcibly, the many plans centered on the lower reaches
of the Sacramento mean the fallacy that a river may be
relieved by delivering its flood current into its own chan
nel. The tide level of Suisun Bay cannot be changed by
any such process. We must go farther tap stream in
search of a remedy, which must be found in keeping the
great floods out of the river entirely. Those floods come
down the mountains at right angles to the general course
of the river. If they can be intercepted and carried in a
waterway parallel with the river and drawn off and
stored the solution is complete.
The ancient river system, tljat existed before the moun
tain upraise, was such that the stream ran generally
north and south. Gravel mining has revealed the beds of
those ancient rivers. When the mountain chain was
raised the direction of the line of drainage changed and
the new water courses cut the old approximately at right
angles. If it be within the capacity of engineering
science and within the power of any available sum of
money to make a new river following the general course
of the ancient streams to intercept the existing rivers 'he
relief sought will be attained.
When we sec the Chicago River upset and instead of
running into Lake Michigan made to run out of it, and
when we consider the diverting works that are to carry
the waters of the Truckee over into the .sink of the Car
son, and the not less significant diversion of the water of
the Tuolumne into the grand canals of the Modesto and
Turlock districts, and of the Merced into Lake Yosemitc,
it cannot be said that this proposed interception of the
floods of the Sacramento is impossible.

fruitless endeavor and the frittering away of fortunes

not be too ready to abandonÂ«the date if it show a shy

HAMILTON* NIGHT SCHOOL.
Tin Board of Education will do Its best with
tfce funds that are allowed, but with yearly
Incresrlng demands upon It, and the ol.l build
ings unrepaired. It can barely get along. Im
portant repairs and Improvements must be
made at all cost, and If this boord must run
short cf funds* through the b!ln'ln<rfa of Â«omo
of the Supervisors It might be com
pelled as a last resort to close t*ic fchoola for
a time In order to save the monay needed for
these urgent repairs. The members of ihe
Board of Education assumed th-Mr duties with
a fixed determination to dedicate every effort
to the in-lifting of the conditions of the
teachers and other employes o: the depart
ment, as well as of the children, and suitable
buildings and rooms and sanitary condition*
for the rhl'dren are a part of thai determlni
tlon. Respectfully submitted,
ALFRED RONOOVirrU.
President Board of Education.
To resume, the Board of Kducatlon petitions
that at least as much as was allowed last year
be a iraln allowed this year, to wit: .00(13 cents
out of the $1 limit. This would allow over $440.
000. and would be a great help toward placing
the old buildings in a s'anltary condition. If
the Supervisors could allow us .0963 cents out
of the $1 limit last year, how much easier
can they allow it this year on an Increased
valuation of $43,000,000.
In order to avoid a repetition of this per
petual controversy I respectfully suggest that
a charter amendment be submitted to a vote of
the people, providing for a fixed tax of 12 cents
annually for the support of the schools, the
same as Is now done for the park and for tho
public library, by providing a special tax an
nually. If a special tax of 7 cents can be
provided for the people's pleasure around why
should not a tax of 12 cents be provided for
the maintenance of their schools? The schools
reach at least as far In their scope as does
the park.
The buildings devoted to the cause of public
instruction In this city are a dlrgrace to a
metropolitan city. Our department has re
peatedly called attention to the cataitrophles
liable to occur through the coiUnu*d t Â»e of
buildings for public school purpows wilrh arc
absolutely unfit and unsafe. Such a condition
of affairs would not, I am sure, be permitted
to continue for an hour In any other city.
The canltary conditions of many of ou- schcols
are in violation of every hygienic law. and
our duty is Imperative that they shouM be re
stored to a condition where the health of our
children shall not be under constant menace
FOR A SPECIAL TAX.
So that If the appropriation made by the
Finance Committee is not changed the Board
of Education will have $135,000 less than actu
ally needed for legitimate school purposes, or
only $1,22^,000 â a sum totally Inadequate to
carry on the department during the next fiscal
year.
They have Included In their appropriation
of $1,361 000: $7000 for playground;- $20,000
for light' and water: $108,000 which they
know will not exist at the end of this fiscal
year â a total of $135,000 not available for
school ptirpoeeÂ« durftig next fiscal year.
The policy of the Finance Commute*. It
would seem, has beÂ«n to make It appear that
the appropriation for school purposes Is large,
when In reality the amount which Is left after
the fictitious sums have been deducted Is
barely sufficient to keep the department going
even In the lamest way and leaving children
In poorly ventilated and unsanitary rented
rooms.
In recent years the annual expenditure of
nearly $20,000 for light and water and $7000
for the playground have been saddled on the
School Department. Our appropriation is
further fictitiously swelled by these amounts,
which should be appropriated by the Super
visors separately and apart from the school
funds, as Is done with the public buildings of
other departments. In former years the Board
of Supervisors Included In their annual adver
tisement for water and gas to be furnished
the municipality, the requirements of the
Board of Education in those commodities. The
Board of Education recommended that this
same system be again pursued in order that a
uniform rate for all municipal buildings be
secured, as the rates charged by the gas and
water companies have heretofore been much
hlrher for the School Department than for
those obtained by the Supervisors for other
municipal buildings. This would be a saving
to the taxpayers, but our recommendation has
been disregarded in this matter as in every
thine else.
It will thus be seen that the members of
the Hoard of Supervisors who have voted in
lavor of the . budget aa submitted by the
Finance Committee have erred In assuming
that this sum of $108,000 will be on hand
after July 1 and I believe I have conclusively
shown to your Honor and to all fair-minded
men that there will not be a surplus of $103,-
OOO or any other sum to the credit of the
School Department after July 1, 1904, and
that tbe Finance Committee has allowed in
reality $108,000 less than they pretend. The
contention of the Board of Education In this
v/hole matter is not only that tbe Supervisors
have no precedent to pursue In carrying over
?108,OUO of a supposed surplus, even if it did
exist, but also that they have not the slightest
shadow of moral, legal or equitable tight In
support of an arbitrary and unwarranted dec
laration of a surplus which does not and will
not exist. No attention whatever has been
paid by the Finance Committee to our petition
to provide funds to install for the safety of the
children an electric flre alarm system in each
public schoolhouEe, said system to be Installed
by the Department of Electricity. Section
1S90 of school law of California maketr it
mandatory "that the Board of Education
must provide suitable fire escapes for each
school building two or more stories in height
undei* their Jurisdiction." Should a tragedy
occur in any of our overcrowded schools such
as was recently enacted at the Iroquola Thea
ter nre In Chicago, the condemnation and ex
ecration of all the world would fall not on
the Board of Education, but on those Super
visors who neglect to provide for these neces
sities.
FIRST IN 1MPOKTAXCE.
And of all the permanent Improvements so
noisily trumpeted by this Finance Committee
as having been provided for in their budfc-et
which of them dues not drop to Insignificance
when compared with the repairs and perm
anent Improvements so absolutely required for
the preservation of the health and. as I have
said, even the lives of the children?
The apparent Increase of the appropriation
over that of last year has been carefully pre
pared by the Finance Committee to appear
like an increase, but in reality veils their
programme covertly to assail and weaken thu
School Department. The apparent appropria
tion made by the Finance Committee is $1,301,
000, made up as follows:
From the State (estimated) $873,000
Rents (Lincoln School lots, etc.) S8,C(X)
State school moneys now standing to
the credit of this fiscal year arbi
trarily and without precedent car
ried forward Into next fiscal year
by the Finance Committee of the
Supervisors on May 28 (more than
one month before the close of the
fiscal year) against the earnest pro
test of the Board of Education and
notwithstanding that the Board of
Education liaÂ» already expended a
large part of it and hag entered
Into actual contract for the balance 103,000
Municipal taxes (.OCSS cents out of
Â¥1 limit) 320,000
Total $1,301,000
Ostensibly the members of the Finance Corns
mlttee have made an allowance of $1,361,000,
but with full knowledge of conditions they
have included In this amount the sum of $108,
000 which they full well know will not be on
hand at the close of this fiscal year, notice
having been given to them that the following
vums have been either contracted for or al
ready expended:
State high school tax received last January
and already expended, $19,000.
Option to purchase lot to enlarge and Im
prove Noe Valley School playground, $3000.

in children, for the rrpalrÂ» and permanent
improvements so necessary for the health, aye.
In many cases the very lives of the children.
It matters not to this Finance Committee,
however, what the Increased revenue of the
city may be. Their evident purpose Is to hold
the School Department In a state of stagnation
as far as their power may accomplish this,
allowing not one cent for the natural increase
Whenever I have spoken with members of
the Finance Committee regarding tbe*e and
other great necessities of the School Depart
ment I have always been mPt with (treat
protestations of friendliness for the School
Department, but beyond these empty words
naught ever comes from them. Their stock
excuse has always been that the one dollar
limit does not provide a sufficient revenue to
run all the departments of the city govern
ment and at the same time allow any money
for rehabilitating the old buildings. The
slightest examination of facts will show that
this is net true. Last year .0003 cents out
of the one dollar limit of taxation was al
lowed for the school department, producing a
revenue of $405,000 of municipal cash. This
year in the face of an Increased assessment
roll of $43,000,000 the same Finance Committee
has the hardihood to reduce our pro rata of
the one dollar limit to .OB8S cents, which will
produce a revenue of only $320,000 of municipal
cash; or $S5,000 less than last year, and that,
too. In face of the annually expanding needs
of the department and its Increased enroll
ment of pupils. Tbe State, on the contrary,
has Increased her- appropriation and does so
annually, not because she loves us any more
than she does other counties, but because the
number of children Is increasing annually and
the census of children of school age this year
will reach over 95,000, as against 91,000 last
year.
. The appropriation from the State Is made
en a basis of $9 per year for each child of
school age. and she Is doing her duty by
allowing enough money, on tbe basis of the
Increase In the number of children. The
Finance Committee in their budget allow ab
i<olutelr nothing of city taxes toward this
Increase, but on the Contrary they allow this
department IS5.000 less than they did last
year; In other words their programme for
the pact few years has been -a see-saw propo
sition, with the appropriation of municipal
moneys on the lower end, allowing of muni
pal cash in an Inverse ratio from the 8tate
to as to keep the appropriation of the School
Department practically statuary, notwith
standing the natural Increase of children and
the expense of educating them and notwith
standing the deterioration of buildings and
furniture from continuWuse.
The Board of Education receives the blame
for not Improving these conditions when the
blame should fall properly upon those who de
liberately refuse to furnish the means to bet
ter them, namely, the majority of the Board
of Supervisors. â¢ â¢ â¢ In the face of the
fact that the present defective plumbing and
unsanitary toilet systems have been condemned
by the health authorities, and that a full and
detailed report of these conditions has been
made year after year to this same Finance
Committee of the Board of Supervisors, their
Indifference and heedlessness of the children of
the people of San Francisco are little short of
criminal.
The dilapidated buildings that need repairing
are legacies of the past, monuments to the
stupidity or lack of foresight of those who
have neglected to provide funds to keep them
in condition. The cost of painting, repairing
and placing sJI the old buildings and toilet
systems in good condition has been carefully
estimated after six months' time spent on the
work by Civil Sen-ice Inspector of School
Buildings J. McSheehy, and will be nearly
$200,000.
The IsÂ«ue on thlÂ« question of urgent repairs
and Improvement* to old buildings must be
met some time, and we propose to meet it now.
These buildings are not Improving with age.
Each year for the last three years the atten
tion of this same Finance Committee has been
called to the disgraceful condition of some of
our buildings and to the defective toilet and
plumbing systems, condemned by the Board
cf Health as dangerous to the lives of the
children, always receiving the same answer,
"We will do all we can for the School Depart
ment in our next appropriation."
LEGACIES OF THE PAST.
The grounds on which we base our petition
are as follows: When the bond Issue was be
ing prepared, by the Utilities Committee of the.
Bnard of Supervisors (Supervisor Braunhart.
chairman) th? Board of Education submitted a
very complete list of urgently needed repairs
and other improvements. Including a complete
renovation of the plumbing and sanitary toilet
rystcma of our schools. The chairman of this
committee blue penciled the whole list, saying
that the bond election would be called only for
new school buildings, and that atl contem
plated renovations to existing buildings would
be provided for out of the regular annual ap
propriations.
Hon. Eugene E. Schmitz, Mayor of the City
and County of San Franciscoâ Sir: The un
friendly attitude toward the School Department
taken by the Finance Committee of the Hoard
Â«t Supervisors, consisting; of Supervisors Dran
d2iifctÂ»!n. d'Anccna and Payot. In refusing to
allow any moneys for much needed repairs, ad
Â«1lt!onÂ» and sanitary Improvements to our
old buildlnrs, makes neceeeary this report
to you. The Board of Education respectfully
petitions your Hont>r to oppose so much of the
budget as applies to the common school fund.
In order that the more considerate member* of
the Hoard of Supervisors whu believe in safe,
sanitary school buildings may have an oppor
tunity to reverse the actlcn of the -Finance
Committee.
Finally, the president of the Board
of Education emphasizes the need of
a special school tax and recommends
that a charter amendment for that
purpose be submitted to the people.
The substance of the letter follows:
SAN FRANCISCO, June C, 1001.
Roncovieri charges the Supervisors
with a deliberate attack upon . the
School Department in thus reducing
its income in the face of the well
known factB that the number of chil
dren of school ape is vastly increasing
every year and that the amount of
mxable property is J43.OO0.O00 larger
this year than last. He asks the Mayor
to oppose bo much of the budget a3
applies to the common school fund
with a view to compelling its revision
and the granting of the same percent
age of the city's income as last year,
namely, .0963 centa out of the dollar
limit. This would give $440,000, or
$120,000 more from municipal taxation
than the budget adopted yesterday al
lows. According to President Ronco
vieri. it would enable the School Board
to make the most essential repairs in
the older buildings.
A ringing protest against the action
of the Board of Supervisors in refus
ing the larger appropriations asked for
by the Board of Education was filed
yesterday with Mayor Schmitz by
President Roncovieri of the latter body.
The letter especially attacks the
Tinanre Committee of the Supervisors
for what it describes a? wanton
disregard of the health and even the
lives of the pupils. This is declared to
have been shown by the committee's
failure to provide funds for reparrs of
many old school buildings that have
be*n condemned by the Board of
Uealih as unsanitary.
President P.ontovieri, speaking for
the School Board, says that the Super
visors have reduced the amount of
municipal taxes allowed for school
purposes during the coming fiscal year
to j:<20,000, or $85,000 less than was given
In this year's budget. To cover up this
deduction, he avers, they carried for
ward the amount of $108,000 from this
year's income on the ground that on
May 28, when the Finance Committee
made up its estimate, this amount was
still unexpended, although the Finance
Committee had notice that it was al
ready contracted for and that the whole
sum would be spent before July 1.

ing won distinction in the practice of
law on both sides of the bay.
The marriage ceremony will be pre

MIDSUMMER JINKS
OF BOHEMIAN* CLUB
Santos-Dumont Will, Attend as the
Guest of the Only Joseph
1). neckline.
James D. Phelan, president of the
Bohemian Club, wires from Paris to
the club that Joseph D. Redding will
manage the Sunday morning concert
of the midsummer jinks. Mr. Red
ding will bring to the redwood grove
new music and will bring as his guest
Santos-Dumont.
The club Is making the usual prepa
ration for the summer expedition to
the woods. It is announced that the
camp will open Tuesday, August 9. The
high Jinks is scheduled to take place
Saturday night, August 20.
The first high jinks of the club
among the great redwoods that fringe
the Russian River took place in the
summer of 1879, twenty-five years ago.
Among the speakers on that occasion
were John F. Swift, Frank M. Pixley.
Paul Neumann and Daniel O'Connell.
Sketches of the camp were made by
Toby Rosenthal and Jules Tavernier.
Breaks Gardener's Jaw.
William Kramer, a gardener at Har
bor View Park, secured a warrant
from Police Judge Mogan yesterday
for the arrest of Jeremiah Revere on
a charge of > battery. He alleges that
last April Revere's dog ran into the
park and began to destroy the flowers.
When Kramer remonstrated with Re
vere he received a blow that broke
his Jaw. He had been under medical
care since.
None of these fighters mentioned got
into close cuarters and mixed it wltli
the iron framed bollermaker. And now,
with the vast strides toward improve
ment shown by Jeffries during the past
year. Jack Munroe does take the bit
between his teeth and wade in, every
body will be at home and to the hay
early. If Jack lasts four rounds then
he is a pig for punishment.
Admitting that Madden'a Intentions
were for the good of the game and
that he never gazed on the pari-mu
tuel board where betting on the rounds
attracted speculators and conceding
that Ruhlin did not purchase all of the
malt goods down at Blanken's Six-
Mile House a few days prior to the
contest, Gus made a showing in front
of Jeffries that seems now like a sum
mer's dream. No wonder one Billy
Milton hung his hat on the kinetoscope
machine and ruined the pictures.
As Jeff stalked to his corner on the
evening of his encounter with the
speckled beauty. Bob Fitzsimmons, he
sat down sulking and surly, and hl3
friends were at a loss for the reason.
The flooring of the ring had been im
properly constructed, so It transpired
afterward. Light boards had been used
under the rine padding and with frail
supports beneath the footing was
springy when the weight of the huge
champion was placed upon It. Fighting
under such fearful disadvantage, Fitz
simmons while he pummeled the cham
pion some with stinging lefts, was ut
terljj/outclassed. and a couple of bard
raps and eight rounds sufficed.
The irrepressible James J. Corbett,
after Imbibing of the fountain of youth
somewhere down In the everglades of
Florida or the meshes of Mott street.
New York, imagined he was good again
and entitled to another chance. Cor
bett in all seriousness told his admirers
he . could not lose. Jeff gave Corbett
the opportunity to demonstrate what
Professor Tommy Dare's treatment
would do and the result is well known.
Enjoying his work with the keen relish
of the fish pond man disposing of num
ber cards to Reuben Glue and his fol
lowing at a country fair, Jeff rag
timed along for ten rounds, when It
was curtains for the conquerer of John
L. Sullivan.
WTien Jack Munroe was introduced
to the crowd at Woodward's Pavilion
on the nlghtof the Canole-Nelson
scrap, he saldrdurlng the course of hl3
short speech, that he had Journeyed
west to fight Jeffries and would not run
away. If the miner keeps his promise
and will test his strength and punches
against the boilermaker's fortifications
and battery, carriages may be ordered
for a very short struggle. When Gua
Ruhlin, the big dub from Akron, Ohio,
faced Jeff at Mechanics* Pavilion he
stopped one just north of the equator
in the fourth round, and Madden, to
save his man fron; farther punishment,
so he said, threw up the sponge. With
out belittling the power of Jeff's hit
ting proclivities and tipping the "bea
ver" out of respect for the
humaneness of Madden, this "listens
good" and such acts may tend to ele
vate the fistic art. But If Madden will
turn to page 32. third line from the bot
tom, he will read from the philosophy
of "One-Eyed" Connelly: "There 13
a sucker born every minute, but lacfc
of rain in some countries during the
juicy months has a tendency to keep
them stunted."
HARBIN SPRINGS, June 6.â All
hostilities were suspended and Sunday
was a day of peace and quiet in the
Jeffries camp. The champion took a
run on the road after breakfast and
this marked the extent of hl3 exer
tions In the training line. The big fel
low can afford to take matters quietly,
for his condition is, or will be, perfec
tion itself on the evening of the big
battle.
By F. E. Mulholland.
NEW YORK, June 6.â Eddie Hanlon
and Terry McGovern -will not fight on
July 15 as arranged. By mutual agree
ment the pair will met on September
15 instead. When they signed articles
a few weeks ago they agreed to leave
the combat open to the highest bidder.
When the bids were opened to-day it
was found that the proposal of the
National Athletic Club of Philadelphia
was the largest. This club has offered
80 per cent of the gross receipts for a
six-round contest. Next came the of
fer of a purse of $5000 from the Waver
ly Athletic Club of Chicago, and an
offer of a $6000 purse from the Lenox
Athletic Club of Philadelphia, for a
six-round fight. A bid was also re
ceived from the Eureka Athletic Club
of Baltimore, which is controlled by
Al Herford, the manager of Joe Gans.
This organization offered to allow the
boxers 65 per cent of the gross receipts.
The lowest proposal came from the
Hayes Valley Athletic Club of San
Francisco, which offered 60 per cent.
The representatives or both men
were much surprised when they learn
ed of the California club's bid, as they
expected that this organization would
give more money for the battle than
the others. It was as a result of this
offer that the managers agreed to put
the fight off until September 15 so as
to give other clubs in San Francisco
a chance to get the fight. San Fran
cisco is Hanlon's home. and for this
reason alone it is thought, If the fight
is held there, It would attract a big
crowd.

Sportsdom was thrown Into convul
sions last night by the well authenti
cated announcement that James J. Jef
fries had started negotiations to secure
a postponement of the heavy-weight
championship battle between himself
and Jack MunroÂ® for a date In June, a
week or ten days later than that on
which It was originally set, which Is
the 17th of the present- month. - â¢
General incredulity was expressed
among: the wise ones, but an investiga
tion disclosed that there was a sound
basis for the rumor. Yesterday after
noon James W. Coffroth, manager of
the Yosemlte Club, under the auspices
of which the battle is scheduled to take
place, was approached by a mutual
friend of his and of Jeffries' and told
that the heavyweight champion de
sired a postponement.
"Such a suggestion. \ras made to me
yesterday afternoon," said Coffroth
last night at the Alcazar Theater, "by
a young man who returned from Har
bin Springs last night. He Is a warm
friend of Jeffrie^ and also of mine, and
1 decline to give his name," as he is
prominent in business circles and
would not like to be mentioned In con
nection with the coming boxing match.
"He told me that Jeffries desired a
postponement until some later date, if
suoh could be secured. He said that
Jeffries understood that the battle
must come off some time In June in
order to cover the permit of the club,
but that he would like to carry the
date along as far as possible.
"This man does not represent Jef
fries officially in any way, but I have
no doubt that he expressed the cham
pion's wishes. At first I thought that
Joff might have hurt himself, but I
was assured that nothing untoward
had happened to the big fellow and
that he only desired to take a little
more time to train."
Coffroth hid the secret under his
Fhirt bosom until he met Billy Roach
at dinner last night in a down-town
rÂ«>ftaurant. Roach Is acting manager
of Munroe until Harry Pollak arrives
from the East. Then he unbosomed
himself. Roach told Coffroth that the
Munroe forces would not consent to a
delay of one day under any circum
stances. As there is a forfeit of $2500
up by each of the fighters, Jeffries will
have to round to before June 17 or for
feit this neat bunch of money.
The report of Jeffries* request for a
postponement was made public so late
that no communication could be se
cured with the champion at Harbin
Springs, where he is training.
INDIAN GIRLS EXPERT
BASKET BAIiLi PLAYERS
Team From Fort Shaw Will Strive for
the National Pennant at
St. ixmis.
BUTTE. Mont., June 6. â The Fort
Shaw Indian girls* basket ball team,
the crack aggregation of Its kind in
the Northwest, is en route to St. Louis
Exposition, where the dusky maidens
will battle ifor the national pennant.
The team Is giving exhibitions at
points along the route. Since their
organization two years ago the In
dians have lost but one contest, that
defeat occurring several weeks after
the team was formed.
Jack Munroe, the burly and good
natured young man who waved by
by to a hammer and drill in favor of
padded gloves and a equare patch of
canvas with ropes around It, was
fltept busy yesterday at his training
quarters at Sheehan's Tavern on the
beach. He is matched to fight Cham
pion Jim Jeffries on June 17, and he is
not losing any time in putting himself
in condition.
Dick Adams, who has followed Jef
fries ever since the beginning of his
Viatic career, like a coach dog under a
buggy, was one of the interested spec
tators of Munroe's work, and he came
away in a thoughtful mood. He said:
They've been telling me that Munroe couldn't
be moved around with a steam derrick, but
don't you believe that. I went out there ex
pecting to find a man that you could tie a
thoroughbred horse to during a. fight and he
wouldn't even jerk the bridle. Forget these
vain words. Munroe is not the bronze etatue
I believed him. He gets around on his feet
wonderfully fast for a heavy man. I don't
think he is as good in foot work as Jeffries,
but the percentage is not heavy enough to
decide a tight outside of other points.
3ICXROE IS A FIGHTER.
Munroe is no club boxer, who Elaps in two
ounces of elove and then Jumps clear across
the ring. He is a fighter, but at the same
time handy enough on his (eet not to trip
himself up. He is always on top ot his man
and he has one cf the wickedest rights I ever
"have seen. He is also good al quick jabbing
with his left. It was apparent that he has
strength, courage and good nature. Ehirlng
one of the bouts he received a scratch on his
no6e and the man boxing with him kept play
ing for that. Munroe did not mind it and
merely blocked and feinted, occasionally de
livering a phantom punch, which, if cut loose,
would have landed his opponent somewhere
near the Farallones.
When Adams was informed that Jef
fries desired a postponement of two
weeks he screwed up his mouth, but
declined to discuss the causes of such
a request.
Munroe, Andy Gallagher and a few
other friends took a ride in an automo
bile yesterday. The chauffeur tried to
make a close finish with the steps of
Sheehan's Tavern and nearly dumped
the party out. He beat the steps out
for one plank, but lost a tire from the
front wheel of the machine.
BOXES WITHOUT REST.
During 'the training Munroe took on
Owen Sullivan, Jack Sull, Frank Mc-
Dcrmott and Masso and. Foley of the
Olympic Club. He fought a three
minute round with each of these with
out resting and then took on Andy
Gallagher for heavy work without
taking a breathing spell. The work
closed with another round with Galla
gher with a breastplate on. and here
the miner was able to extend himself
somewhat without danger of hurting
his opponent. This made twenty-three
minutes of fast work without a breath
ing spell.
Munroe has a shoulder and elbow
movement that is novel and may' be
dangerous. He leads a short blow with
his right and apparently misses. Then
he comes back with his elbow to the
EOlar plexus and his glove is there
again as he withdraws the elbow. It is
a deceptive blow^and a hard one and
particularly difficult to block.
Billy Ra#ch would like to have any
of the amateur or professional heavy
weights who desire to try Munroe out
visit the quarters any day during the
boxing and they will be accorded a
chance.
Harry. Pollak and Young Corbett left
New York yesterday on their way to
this city.
What few bets that have been regis
tered on the result bo far are at the
odds of ten to four on Jeffries, and
even money that he will win inside of
ten rounds.

named "Soldier" Jack Thompson. It
took lees than two rounds to put him
down for the count. The Sydney pa

ness during the first round.

Accidents completely marred the

features of the card. Out of six start

winner being^Montanic, a 6 to 1 shot,
while Donami, the extreme outsider in
the betting, at 40 to 1, was second.
These were the only two which averted
any mishap.
The weather conditions were none too
pleasant at Harlem to-day, a stiff, cold
wind blew down the home stretch and
made things generally unpleasant. The
track was much better than was ex
pected and, although still lumpy and
rough, was comparatively dry.
Starter Dwyer, who .was operated
upon late Saturday for appendicitis, is
reported as making favorable progress
toward recovery.

the final eighth the old horse ran over
his field and won going away, with a
length and a half to spare.
CHICAGO. June 6. â An "old-fash
ioned killing" was made by Frangible
in the first race at Harlem this after
noon. This one-time popular horse on
the local tracks was "the goods" to
day and when he opened at 20 to 1
there was a rush from every quarter
of the ring to get aboard. When the
bugle call sounded the horses to the
post. Frangible had been backed down
to 11 to 2 and money was still going on
him.

Profeasor Charles Keeler lectured at
the Academy of Sciences Hall last
night, choosing for hi8 subject "Nature
Study and Its Relation to Life and
Art." He stated that observation
should be the keynote of early educa
tion.
Communing with nature would al
ways result In improvement to mind
and body. He condemned the killing
of birds and said that the women were
largely responsible for the wanton de
struction of the songsters of the for
est in order that they might bedeck
themselves with their beautiful plum
age.
He also believed in the preservation
of our forests. He eaid the destruc
tion of some of the grandest trees we
have on this coast proved that at the
present time everything was subor
dinated to commercialism.
A large audience applauded his re
marks.

Attorney George D. Collins applied
for a writ of mandate before Judge
Lawlor yesterday to compel Police
Judge Cabaniss to proceed with the
trial of Blanche Rey, one of the In
matea at 1129 Dupont street, charged
with vagrancy, without the presence
of the defendant. The District Attor
ney interposed a demurrer,, which was
sustained, by the Judge, who said that
a defendant in a misdemeanor case
must be present at the commencement
of the trial, but may absent himself
or herself thereafter.

John Carter was instructed and ar
raigned before Judge : Fritz on a
charge of assaulting with intent to rob
J. Graham,' a waiter "at Market and
Kearny streets, early yesterday morn
ing. Graham stated that Carter and
two other men attacked him from be
hind and Carter thrust a hand into his
pocket- â¢ He ran " away, shouting for

Carter. The case will be heard to-!
morrow*. % â¢ _ .
Dan Danbrowski, who tends bar on
Minna street, wandered north of the
slot last Sunday evening and dropped
into Frank Hoffman's saloon on Kear
ny street, where he insisted on being
allowed to gamble with dice for
money wagers. Mr. Hoffman, who
was tapping a keg of beer, resolutely
objected and the ensuing argument
was brought to a finish by Mr. Dan
browski receiving a severe blow upon
the head from a hammer in the hand
of lit Hoffman. Case heard by Judge
Cabaniss and dismissed on the ground
that Mr. Hoffman was justified in pre
venting violation of the antl-gamlng
ordinance on his premises.
"I'm sick and tired of being pinched
every time I put my nose out o'doors,"
said Lottie Gonzales to Judge Mogan,
"and if you let me go. I'll <juif the
town and go to my sister at' San Jose."
"You have told me that same thing
so often that I am beginning to doubt
your sincerity, Miss Gonzales," re
sponded his Honor, "but I'll keep you
in suspense till to-morrow as to
whether you will go to Santa Clara
County or the San Francipco County
Jail."
It was Miss Gonzales* third "pinch
ing" within a month.
There are three distinct charges of
robbery against H-rry Singer, who is
alleged to have obtained admittance
to dwellings by falsely representing
himself to be a book agent and then
to have pilfered portable property.
His accusers are Alice J. Smith of 410
Octavla street, Mary Slmmonds of 816
Valencia street and Laura Cogill of
1292 Turk street- Judge Mogan will
hear the case on June 10, by which
time the defendant says he will have
obtained money from St. Louis to pay
for his defense.
Ah Him, a gigantic Chinese lunatic,
whose particular hallucination is that
the Hall of Justice is his ancestral
castle and Portsmouth Square his
hunting park, was given three months
by Judge Fritz. When out of jail Ah
Him refuses to work, but in prison he
is a mervel of industry. Bailiff Con-
Ian promised to see that the unfor
tunate Celestial's imagined property
is not tampered with by vandal hands
during his incarceration.
William Burns, an ex-fireman, was
unable to explain what prompted him
to turn in a false alarm from the box
at Eddy and Taylor streets and there
by convey unnecessary terror to the
notoriously timorous feminine resi
dents of the neighborhood. "Thirty
days," said Judge Cabarnss. "And
that's no false alarm," quoth Prose
cuting Attorney Hanlan.
Sixteen-year-old Lawrence E.
Wahnd, son of respectable parents of
Los Angeles, called on his old friend
P. E. Lowe, an electrician, at 623 How
ard street and found him coatless and
in the act of shaving himself. The
boy's visit was unusually brief and
when Mr. Lowe finished his shave and
donned his coat he found that a purse
containing ?20 had been abstracted
Trom a pocket of the garment. The
case was given to Policeman Groat,
who arrested Master Wahnd on San
some street and found the purse and
money in his possession. The lad con
fessed guilt to Judge Cabanlss, who
took the case under advisement.
Mr. and Mrs. John Mowrie will be
tried before Judge Mogan to-day on a
charge of battery. r The man is a team
ster and his wife Is employed in a Pa
cific street dance hall, apparently with
his consent and certainly with his
knowledge. She spat in the face of a
young man who declined her invitation
to dance and his mild protest against
the salivary rebuke was rewarded
with a blow on his mouth from the
brawny husband's fist. An additional
charge of vagrancy is likely to be en
tered against the woman.
Warner Granloaf, a ship carpenter,
was drinking with John J. Mangin,
Louis "Wilkins and Michael Brennan
In an East street saloon when he sud
denly told them he wanted to go out
and sret some money and requested
them to await his return. He returned,
but accompanying him were a couple
of policemen and he had the three men
arrested and charged with robbing him
of 15 cents. When the case was called
in Judge Mogan's court Granloaf failed
to appear and a bench warrant was
issued for his arrest.
Thomas Horgan eluded imprison
ment by taking an appeal and furnish
ing a bond when Judge Mogan sen
tenced him to six months for wife
beating, but four weeks later he again
assaulted his better half and was ar
rested. Now he is in jail and will prob
ably stay there until he has served
out the remaining five months of his
original sentence.
and "William Flanagan, small boys,
were "cutting up" on Bryant street, be
tween Tenth and Eleventh, late Satur
day night, by softly stealing up stair
wayB of apartment houses, screaming
"murder" and "fire" and running down
with great noise. This entertainment
was occasionally varied by smashing
empty bottles in hallways and wound
ing the feet of gentlemen who ran out
In alarm and without shoes. The
neighborhood was in a regular frenzy
of excitement and indignation ere the
desperadoes were captured. Judge Mo
gran holds their fate in a balance.
"Ah. you know something about our
nn^ts. then. I must hold you till to
morrow for further inquiry and I hope
ihat in the meantime father's yacht
will not trip her anchor and sail
Arthur Thompson. George Hartwell
away."
She was booked as "Jennie Lind"
and the police pronounced her a new
<>ne to them. She wore a nautical jack
et and cap and her blonde hair was
?=adly frowzled.
"A stranger in our city. Miss Lind?"
remarked Judge Mogran. inquiringly.
""Yes," she replied. "Father's yacht
is anchored at Tiburon and I -came
over to get some necessary supplies."
"The policeman says he found you
early Sunday morning loitering at
Keamy and Clay etreets and that you
appeared to be intoxicated."
"He found me at Kearny and Sacra
mento streets and I was not intoxi
cated."
Judge Mogan has the case under
advisement and the defendant's attor
nrys are deluging him with authorities
to prove that the police board is au
thorized to supervise and control the
liquor trade only and not every line
of business that the Supervisors may
levy license apon. More arguments
will be heard on June 13.
Ordinance No. 168 permits the Board
of Police Commissioners to enforce the
collection of license from dealers in all
kinds of second-hand goods with the
exception of furniture, and P. J. Neu
inan, who deals in second-hand hard
ware at 724 Howard street, claims that
the ordinance is class legislation and
therefore unconstitutional. He was ar
rested for doing business without a
Uoe nse.
In his own defense Mr. Beattie, with
carefully lubricated hair parted in the
middle and diRclosing: merely a streak
jf forehead, stated that Mr. Sparovich
was a willing, not to say eager, pur
haser, despite the fact that he (Mr.
s.) could neither utter nor understand
Knglish, even as she is spoke on the
.vater front. Mr. Goldstein also averred
thai Mr. Sparovfch was treated with
extreme mercantile courtesy from be
ginning to end of the transaction. To
have returned his money would have
beeai a violation of the tenets of the
trade. Mr. Goldstein added.
"I'll take this case under advisement
till to-morrow." eaid the Judge, '"and
1 would suggest that in the meantime
the money alleged to have been taken
from the complainant be restored to
h5m and that he return the watch and
< liain. which he has already offered to
do. Far be it from the intention of this
couxt to throttle the spirit of com
mercial energy that has made this na
tion what it i?, but at the same time
there is a limit to commercial legiti
macy which, I believe, has been over
stepped by this defendant. There is
a well defined law of commerce which
says that it takes at least jwo to make
?. trade, and in this case the evidence
thows that there- was only one and
that one not the complainant. I again
hint that it would be well to return to
this unsophisticated foreigner the
money he declares he did not willingly
spend."
"Rush sales and large profits" was
evidently the motto adhered to by
Julius Goldstein, retail Jeweler, at 30
Kast street south. In the court of
Police Judgre Mogan yesterday Mr.
Goldstein testified that a watch and
rhain for which he paid $3 were sold
by him for $12 60, and tnat the latter
transaction did not consume more than
rive minutes by the ferry depot clock.
Graco Sparovich, a Slavonian, was
the person from whom Mr. Qoldstein
obtained the $12 60, and through an in
terpreter Mr. Eparovich told of how
it came to happen. He was passing the
â¢Joldstoin store, he eaid. and incident
ally glanced at the show window,
which was fairly aglitter with
jewels and gems, when he was
t-cized by Thomas Beattie, "side
walk worker," who rushed him in
side and there inserted the watch and
chain in one pocket, deftly abstracted
the $12 60 from another, escorted him
to the door* and cordially invited him
to come asain. When he recovered
frum the daze into which he had been
cast by such rapid-transit commer
cialism Mr. Sparovich demanded a re
turn of his money, but was laughed to
scorn. Then he caused the arrest of
Mr. Boattie.

OPEIT EVEBT OAT IN THE TEAB.
TO WHOM IT MAT CONCERN : A year and
three months ago I was attacked with that
terrible disease, locomotor ataxla. Power to
balance, stand, or even sit down, entirely lost.
Two best doctors of San Francisco and Hot
Springs, Ark. failed to hÂ»lp me. My stom-
ach, bowels and kidneys failed to work. I had j
catarrh of stomach, head and bladder as a re-
sult of the disease; these troubles became i
chronic. At times my heart would beat like a
drum, my eyes grew weak, ray memory bad. .
my nerves wrecked. Three- months ago I went j
to Tuscan Springs. What happened since was j
a pleasant surprise to me. Drank the waters, ,
took the baths â after thrrn weeks' treatment i
stomach, bowels, bladder and kidneys in per- 1
fect condition, eyesight perfect, nervousness J
gone, memory good. Aft^r three months' treat- i
ment, walked without a cane, with eyes closed j
and up and down steep hills; am cured of this t
dread 'disease, now walk with slight limp.
Have run stores in seventeen towns of the
State of Calltornia; am well known In down-
town districts of San Francisco; Inquiry thers
will prove truth of my helplesfi condition three
months ago. Further information, address

rant issued in April last charging him
with the murder of Policeman Eugene

The case was dismissed, as the war
rant had been sworn to prior to Ken
nedy's release on a writ of habeas cor

yesterday morning charging Kennedy
with the murder and he was again
arrested as he was leaving the court

The present Intention of the Tibetans
Is to prevent Brigadier General Mac-
Donald arriving at Gyangtse, and it is
possible that recent experiences have
taught the enemy how to make his
advance a matter of greater difficulty
than it was the first time.
The Tibetans are now concentrating
in the' monastery and the town of
Gyangtse. Another concentration is
rumored between Ralung and Khang
ma.
manding: that the Amban come to*
Gyangtse with qualified Tibetan rep
resentatives to settle the outstanding
difficulties before June 25, has been re
turned unopened and without com
ment. The Tibetans, therefore, the cor
respondent Bays, have deliberately
chosen war.
GYANGTSE, Tibet, June 6.â A letter
from Colonel Younghusband of the
British mission to the Tibetans, de-
SIMLA, India, June 6.â Two regi
ments of Punjabos, a mountain battery
and a detachment of engineers have
been ordered to reinforce the British

and a Mountain Battery
Great Britain Dispatches
Two Indian Regiments
3I0EE TKOOPS AEE SENT
Larger mains and hydrants^are needed In
many nortions of the city. During the last
few yrars a erf at number of five and six
story frame buildings have been wected for
hotel purposes In the most exixjsed portions
of thÂ» city, known as the boardlng-housÂ» dis
trict â notably on Pine street from Stockton to
Jones. The watT main on Pine street Is but
Â«â¢ Inches in diameter and tho pressure is only
35 pounds to the square Inch; and Is not
enough to supply the companies responding to
first alarm of fire. In the factory district on
Bryant street, from Fourth tr> Ninth, a sim
ilar condition exists. Rincon Hill Is prac
tically unprotected. At Sutter and Cough
streets there are two laree hotels and thÂ«
Lowell High School, with a main but Â« Inches
In diameter. There are other portions of the
city whero similar conditions exist. There
is a lack of hydrants in the thickly populated
portions of tho city, and the recommendation
of the Chief Engineer for 300 additional hy
drants Is highly and earnestly recommended.
The need of an auxiliary salt water system
for th<Â» city Is highly apparent and immediate
provision should be made for the installation
of this Improvement. Tho storage system
recommended by the Board of Fire CommiB
slon*rs. with a reservoir at Twin Peaks, teems
to be the must practical plan, as It will afford
a high pressure to all parts of the city. With
the high pressure thus .obtained the use of
eteam fir* engines would be unnecessary In
some oortions of the city, and afford a great
savlnrr. Auxiliary hotse wagons fully equipped
with hose could be stationed In various part
of the- downtown districts and could be oper
ated by our citizens in the event of-'a larije
conflagration and thus strengthen our Fire
District Attorney Byington and his
assistants in all departments were
given high praise for the thorough per
formance of their duties. All of the
other city and county officials were
highly commended for the conduct ,of
their offices. Blankets at the Alms
house were found to be one half pound
lighter than the specifications called
for. Bookkeeper Kelly's methods of
keeping accounts were condemned, but
nothing could be found to indicate that
he was intentionally criminal.
IMPROVEMENTS ARE NEEDED.
Many recommendations are made In
the report regarding improvements at
the Almshouse, especially in the way
of providing means of escape for the
inmates in case of fire, the construction
of a new building for the feeble women
and repairs on the outbuildings, such
as car barns and stables.
"The old buildings of the Alms
house," says the report, "cannot an
swer the purpose of accommodating
tho 1031 Inmates. Some old people now
occupy hath rooms and closets."
Speaking of the. water supply In con
nection with the Fire Department the
report says:
The ircm bars at the Magdalen
Home and the utter absence of lire
escapes are unfavorably commented
upon. Three fire houses are con
demned as unfit for their purposes and
unsanitary conditions were found in
many of the public schools. By a
unanimous vote a resolution was
adopted asking the Board of Super
visors to appropriate to the school
fund $100,000 of the "$160,000 of unpro
tested taxes in i/rder to remedy the
condition of the school houses.
Another feature of the report was
the recommendation that the conges
tion existing at the various county
jails be relieved by the â¢ use of the
forty-two commodious cells in the
basement of the City Hall, which have
been used as Junk rooms ever since
the removal of the Southern police sta
tion to its quarters on Minna street.
The report characterizes the crowded
quarters at the Broadway County Jail
as "a most positive outrage to decency
and positively against our city law*
and ordinances." ,/. â .
CONDEMNS CROWDED JAILS.
We also find an unsatisfactory state of af
fairs existing between the Police Court Judges
and the Police DeDartmcnt and recommend
that there should be more unity of action be
tween them by affording each other as much
help as Dossible In the furtherance of the
one common cause, the suppression of crime,
and to see justice properly done. We depre
ciate tlÂ»e election of Police Judges by popular
vote.
We find the Police Department run on fairly
strict line* and the patrolmen generally a
well-trained, obedient and healthy body of
men, but the force is entirely Insufficient as
to numbers.
Of the other four men implicated,
James Woods was adjudged guilty of
murder in the first degree and his ap
peal is now pending before the Su
preme Court. William Kauffman was
sentenced to twenty years in San
Quentln and is now serving his term.
John Coulter was given six years at
San Quentin and is there at present.
"Kid" Goucher, son of a prominent at
torney of Modesto, managed to make
his escape and has never since been
heard of by the authorities. Hender
son Is in the County Jail pending the
result of the appeals.
In addition to the indictment against
Kennedy, the Grand Jury submitted
its final report. The principal feature
of It was the declaration that the body
strongly deprecated the. election of Po
lice Judges by popular vote. No recom
mendation was made as to the manner
in which these officials shall be se
lected. The report says:
The most notable event of yester
day's session was the return of an in
dictment for murder against "William
B. Kennedy, alias Richard Jackson,
alias 'lYellow," a mulatto, who is ac
cused of being one of six who killed
Policeman Eugene C. Robinson on the
morning of January 11, 1902. The In
dictment was returned at the request
of the District Attorney, who repre
sented that he had secured additional
evidence that he thought would result
in the conviction of Kennedy.
Kennedy was tried once on the
charge and found guilty of murder in
the first degree. His conviction was
secured on the uncorroborated evidence
of William Henderson, one of the six
men that were concerned in the mur
der. The Supreme Court reversed the
judgment on the ground that one can
not be adjudged guilty on the unsup
ported testimony of an accomplice.
OTHERS IMPLICATED.
After more than five months' exist
ence, the Grand Jury appointed by Su
perior Judge Frank Kerrigan on. De
cember 3, 1903, concluded its labors yes
terday afternoon. The body was
thanked for its services by the Judge
and dismissed.
KENNEDY* IS DISCHARGED.
The report closes as follows:
We regret that the enortness of our term
rre\-ents the accomplishment of anything in
tome of the matters' which we feel to be of
tho moat vital Importance to the welfare of
the citizens at large. Our .experience has
shown us that for business or professional
men. whÂ» cannot devote their entire time,
at least two to three months are required to
become familiar with the duties and require
ments of the Grand Jury. Respectfully sub
mitted. MAX L. ROSENFELD. Foreman.
GUBTAV TRITTENBACH. Secretary.
In its recommendations to the Board
of Public Works the Grand Jury says:
We recommended that several improvements
and alterations be made in the theaters and
large public halls in older to Insure the safety
of the audience in case of panic, whlofc recom
mendations were compiled with.
We recommended to the Board of Public
Works- not to Interfere with the sale of flowers
on the etreets.
We recommend that there bÂ« a salt-water
auxiliary supply plant Installed Â«.t Twin
Peaks, with reservoirs and mains distributed
throughout the city and that the same bÂ« used
for extinguishing fires and flushing the sewers
of the city.
W<? called the attention of the Department
of Electricity and the Board of Supervisors to
the defective electric light wiring at the Alms
house and the urgent necessity of remedying
the same.
We recommend that the city should do Its
own fitreet sweeping and that the city should
liavo its own asphalt plant for the necessary
street work.
RECOMMENDS MORE POLICE.
The report recommends an increase
in the police force of 150 to 200 patrol
men, which the Grand Jury thinks
necessary for the proper protection of
the citizens of San Francisco.
Relating to the Grand Jury's inspec
tion of the work of the Board of Super
visors the following recommendation is
made:
As for the Supervisors, we would state that
we commend their course In mostly every par
ticular, but we would recommend that they
try to forget party politics In their business
relationship with hla Honor the Mayor, and
that they all work together In harmony with
him for the common good of the city.
We would respectfully recommend that more
ample quarters be provided for the stationery
clerk, who at present is, badly cramped for
want of room. We would also recommend that
thla official be better paid. â¢
The buildings for the help are In a dilapi
dated condition and the electric wiring Is Im
perfect, and thero Is a need of fire escapes on
the bulldings.*and the building occupied by the
female nurses Is unfit for the purposes for
which it ia used. While nearly new, the
foundation and flooring are rotted away. We
Â»eÂ«> the necessity for a new hospital at once,
and we would recommend. If another location
should be secured, that the present site should
always be retained by the city as an auxiliary
hospital, the mild climate and pure air In thla
location being unsurpassed In this city.
Under the sections considering the
Public Library and Park Commission,
the report says:
We found the library renerally In excellent
condition; the money seems to be very eco
nomically expended, but the library Is In very
bad condition. The walls are dirty and should
be retimed. We understand this has not been
done for twelve years, and this Is especially
Important because of the light which clean
walls give, which is n<Jw unavailable on ac-
I count of the heavy galleries In the Publlo
library.
"We would strongly recommend that appro
priation be made of $36,000 ror a new branch
library for Branch No. 3. The present quarters
are unsanitary, Inadequate and dangerous to
the books on account of leaks. The present
building is "a rented building, and is of un
satlstactory character. If this appropriation
cannot be secured, we strongly recommend that
$5000 be added to their appropriation for the
purpose of repairing this building and cleaning
up the main library.
The difficulty In the Law Library 1Â« that
each year they give them a minimum amount,
and this la barely sufficient. It Is perfectly
true that there Is not a department of our
city government that is mure economically
handled and for which we get better value for
our money. St. Louis, with less circulation,
get* $15,000 a year more than our library does.
Newark, N. J., has but one-half of our circu
lation and gets 80 per cent of our appropriation.
Vt'e strongly recommend the purchase of the
forest park (San Miguel rancho) of the Sutro
estate, situated west of Stanyan street and
south of the Affiliated Colleges, as the same
would make an addition to Golden Gate Park,
with possibilities for Improvement, making
scenery, the equal of which no city In the
world could boast of.
Concerning the City and County Hos
pital the report says:
We visited the City and County Hospital and
were cordially received by the superintendent
and assistant superintendent and shown
through the different departments. We found,
upon Investigation, that a great many neces
sary improvements had been made with the
limited appropriation â more particularly in the
laundry.
We visited the operating-room and morgue
and found everything neat and In first-class
order. We found the patients In the different
wards clean and well cared for and we could
learn of no complaints.
We found the checking of supplies In and
out of the commissary department kept In a
very systematic manner, and we found the
supplies* and meats to be first class In every
respect
ULBRARY UNSATISFACTORY.
Â¦ In conclusion we earnestly commend the
Board of Fire Commissioners, the Chief En
gineer and the officers and men of the depart
ment for the admirable manner In which It is
conducted, the high standard of efficiency and
discipline maintained, the economical manner
In. which it Is carried on and the good service
rendered to the city by the Board of Fire Com
missioners and the entire department durln*
the year.
We further recommend the appropriation of
sufficient funds to enable the Board of Fire
Commissioners to carry out. their desired plan
of allowing- the members of the department
one day off each week. We feel that such
action would Increase the efficiency of thÂ»
department.
Department In the time of need. The salt
water could also be used for domestic purposes
and for other municipal uses, such as flushing
sewers, etc. It would be a great boon and wel
come Acquisition to the comfort and health of,
our citlEens, and It would render our city safe
from such calamities as have befallen Chicago.
Boston and Baltimore. We therefore urge the
Immediate completion of this most necessary
Improvement.

CHICAGO June 6.â Improved weather con
dition* and e*sler cables Influenced wheat at
the start. Weekly statistics also were a dls<
appointment to the bulls. Initial quotations
on July were '/iiÂ©V4c lower at 87?6Â®SSc. After
selling down to S7%Â«?S7%c the price rallied to
&8%c The firmer feeling was due primarily
to private advices regarding the crop situation
in the Southwent, a prominent firm having
quite bullish reports from that section. While
there was some buying on these reports, the
majority of traders were skeptical as to the
poor prospects, and the market soon developed
renewed weakness. Foreign news was ex
tremely bearish advices from France and In
dia claiming crops to be In excellent condition.
The disposition to sell was considerably aug
mented by the promising outjook of spring
wheat In the Â¦ Northwest and also by the rela
tively small decrease in the visible supply, tho
figures for this week showing a decrease of
only 072.000 bushels, compared with 2.536.000
bushels decrease last week. Weakness in corn
was an added bear factor. After selling off
to 87Hc July closed at 87%c.
Exceedingly liberal receipts, with prospects
of a continued heavy movement, were the
principal cause of an extremely weak corn
market The market closed almost at the
lowest 'point of the session. July opened at
49Uf494c and closed at 48%048%c.
OatÂ« were easy, but there was not much ;
selling pressure on the market and at the low
point prices showed small losses. July opened
at 39S<339Â»4C closing Â«t 39%c
Provisions reflected the weakness of wheat
and corn, buying by commission houses causing
a firm tone. A decline in the price of hogs
and liberal receipts of hogs at Western points
were against the market. The market closed
at the top with Sepumber pork up 20c, lard
7Hc higher and ribs 10ffl24c better.

The new programme at the Chutes
yesterday was^an excellent one and
all of the acts were srreeted cordially.
Richard Walsh and Adele Ligon pre
sented an amusing comedy musical
act out of the ordinary, , and Jones,
Sylvester and Pringle, billed as . "the
imperials of minstrelsy," sang for
twenty minutes to the satisfaction of
the audience. . Gus Kiralf o proved an
amusing juggler, and Alfons, the Eu
ropean equilibrist, repeated . his
cess of last week. Mr. and Mrs/' Ben
Hiinn, the clever colored comedians;
Mildred Manning, the singer 'of illus
trated songs,- and the animatoscope,
showing a sensational life-saving
scene, completed the bill. The ama
teurs will appear on Thursday night.
The Alcazar players are giving a
splendid production of "Under Two
Flags," wWfchhad Its initial presenta
tion last night. The piece is full of
action and ample Justice Is done to Its
scenic requirements. Adele Block has
the opportunity of her career In the
part of Cigarette, in which she scored
an artistic triumph. Her emotional
talents, are given full swing and her
ride through the sandstorm on horse
back was thrilling. Harry 8. HllHard
was capital aa the Earl. He shows In
his clever work the painstaking and
conscientious- actor that he is. James
Durkin was acceptable as Bertie Cecil,
and John B. Maher played a small part
with his accustomed Intelligence. Miss
Frances Starr made a j pleasing Lady
Venetia, and Marie Howe was all that
could be desired in her impersonation
of two characters. Edwin T. Emery
was melodramatic as the Marabout,
and George Osbourne was his usual
good self as Pierre Baroni. All the
parts were well sustained and the
management is to be congratulated on
thelavish mounting it has given the
production.
Maude Adams' engagement at the
Columbia Theater comes t to a close
with next Saturday night's perform
ance of "Jhe Little Minister." One of
the season's attractions is booked for
next Monday night when E. H. Sothern

production of "The Proud Prince," the
miracle play from the pen of Justin
Huntly McCarthy.
quaint wisdom and teaches the maxim
that a man always wins the golden
opinion of his fellows by striving to be
honest and respectable, no nfatter how
humble his calling. Eugenie Thais
Lawton has a pleasant role as a minis
tering angel among the poor and low
ly. Elmer Booth and Julia Blanc, as
a . pair of Bowery Houghs, are excep
tionally good and Ernest Howell does
a creditable coon stunt. Henry Shumer
has the role of a villain in gentlemanly
guise; Edna Ellsmere acts the part of
an adventuress, and James Montgom
ery plays the. prodigal son. Little 01
lie Cooper, as the blind girl, won sym
pathy and applause. "The Peddler" Is
brimful of heart interest and the aud
ience gave enthusiastic testimony of
its genuine delight and. satisfaction.
WASHINGTON*. June 6. â Fourth Assistant
Postmaster General Bristow to-day announced
that the salaries of the rural free delivery mall
carriers will be adjusted on the basis of the
number of miles traveled.
The Central Theater last night made
a hit with a brand new comedy drama,
"The Peddler," the hero of which Is a
German Hebrew, something after the
style of David Warfleld's role in "The
Auctioneer." The play contains a num
ber of stirring melodramatic episodes
and Â¦ New York's Bowery furnishes a
variety of typical characters. The
scenery is new and original. Herschel
Mayall has never before been seen so
clever in Hebrew dialect character and
his essay in the title role was an tgree
abla surprise. The peddler turns out to
be fhe heir to a baronetcy and, after
years of hard luck, he suddenly falls
into the lap of fortune and doesn't for
get his old friends. He has a fund of

San Franciscans that will be denied
the pleasure of viewing the wonders of

given opportunity to-night to learn
what this city has done at the great

of the State. To-night at the Alham
bra Theater J. W. Erwin, a member of
the California Camera Club, under the
direction of which many Â»tereoptican
slides and moving pictures of San
Francisco and California rural scenes
were prepared, will deliver his lecture,
which will daily interest throngs in
the San Francisco building at the in

All San ' Franciscans that do not
know their State as well as they
ought should take advantage of this
opportunity. Prior to the delivery of
the lecture by Mr. Erwin, Frank J.
Symmes, chairman of the committee on
displays, will address the audience.
Both Mr. Erwin and Mr. Symmes are
pleasing talkers and their word pic

HACKS NOT RUNNING.
Owners Fall to Secure Men Without
Licenses to Place on Vehicles.
Hacks, unless they are being driven
by owners or licensed men, are not
running. The men who applied for
positions are not anxious to take
chances against the stablemen, who
are on strike, and the drivers, who are
locked out.
To-night there will be. more or less
discussion of the ability of men who
have applied for positions as drivers
of hacks and the union will be on
hand to watch proceedings when the
Police Commissioners meet.
The owners will endeavor to secure
men who are willing to go to work
and if arrests follow protect them.
Neither side is doing anything which
will result in trouble at the outset, for
the owners say they will go into court
and the drivers say they are not sanc
tioning any violence.
After a spirited contest for the selec
tion of a delegate to represent the local
union of this city at the National Con
vention of Cement Workers at St.
Louis on the 14th, of this month, Louis
L. Mattson carried off the honor by a
small majority. It is estimated that
more than 200 unions will be repre
sented at the convention and as San
Francisco is looked upon as being one
of the prominent cities where a large
number of cement workers are em
ployed the mission of Delegate Mattson
is considered one of great importance
In that body.
Secretary O. A. Tveltmoe of the
Building Trades Council, who has Just
returned from a trip to Sacramento,
gives a glowing account of the success
attending the work being done by the
union men that turned contractors to
meet the demands of the union men
who were out on strikes because of the
trouble with the old contractors, who
had declined to comply with union
rates. In fact, as Tveitmoe put it,
there are not union men enough at
the capital city to fill vacancies, con
sequently a demand had been made on
the union here for all the men that can
be spared.
The Chorus Girls' Union is the last
adjunct to the roll of organized labor.
A delegate from this new union was
admitted to membership In the Labor
Council at the last meeting.
Mrs. Madden, who asked that the case
go over to enable him to secure the
deposition of Rudolph M. Ramat of
Brooklyn, New York, who while on
the transport Hooker with Captain
Madden was supposed to have seen
many things that will not redound to
the captain's credit when told In court.
Dorsey ajso asked for delay to enable
him to get the depositions of several
soldiers of the Twenty-Ninth Infantry
(Madden's regiment), who are sup
posed to have a knowledge of the cap
tain's doings that will aid his wife In
refuting his charges.
Â¦ Mrs. Madden was not in court "when
the case was called yesterday. Cap
tain Madden was on deck, however,
and he was supported by the presence
of his mother and his father, Jerome
Madden. No other army officers were
in court, for they are fighting shy of
the case, but the courtroom was com
fortably filled with enlisted men. A
few army nurses were also in court,
ready to tell what they saw and over
heard about the Maddens at Benicla
barracks and the Presidio.
HANCOCK IS IN COURT.
The sensational Hancock divorce ac
tion, an action which resulted In the se
curing of a decree of divorce by Mrs.
Ella Wood Hancock from Robert Han
cock, a wealthy young man about
town, was revived yesterday In Judge
Seawell's court when the court made
an order amending the decree of di
vorce. Under the original decree Han
cock, who was directed to pay Mrs.
Hancock $300 a month alimony, could
not dispose of any of his property, the
alimony acting as a lien. Now he can
sell It all. with the exception of a piece
at the corner of Sixth and Natoma
streets, for the order made by Judge
Seawell yesterday amends the decree
to that extent. The property on Sixth
street must be held by Hancock as se
curity for the payment of the alimony.
It was in 1901 that the Hancocks
were divorced, Mrs. Hancock seeking
a separation because of her husband's
alleged fondness for Mrs. Lei Wescott.
a pretty singer in the choir of the Cal
ifornia Street Methodist Church, of
which church the Hancocks were mem
bers.
ESCAPES ALIMONY.
Judge Troutt has refused to compel
Charles A. Thurston, a railroad em
ploye, to pay his former wife, Mattie
Thurston. further alimony. He holds
that she relinquished any claims sh&
might have in an agreement signed by
her at the time she secured a divorce.
Judge Sloss has made an order di
recting Jake Greenshan to pay $25 a
month to Fannie Greenshan while his
suit for divorce against her Is pending.
He must also pay her $25 costs and $o5
counsel fees.
Laura Martin and Richard S. Mar
tin, a divorced couple, are battling for
the custody of their child, a little girl,
in Judge Murasky's court. The father
dees not want the little one taken from
the convent in Alameda. where she
was placed when he and his wife were
separated by 'the court's decree. Mrs.
Martin is anxious to have the care of
the little one during the vacation.
Through the aid of Anna Lacey. a pri
vate detective, who sought the com
pany of Mrs. Martin and plied her with
liquor in order that she might get her
to make certain damaging admissions,
Martin Is trying to prove that the
mother of the child Is unfit to have
control of her even for a short time.
The detective gave her evidence yes
terday. Mrs. Martin will have a chance
to refute the charges to-day.
In a complaint filed yesterday by
George J. Reeves he asks the court to
annul his marriage to Frances Reeves
on the ground that his consent to the
marriage was obtained by Mrs. Reeves
through deception. He says that im
mediately after his marriage to her at
Santa Barbara in 1897 he learned that
she was a confirmed morphine fiend
and unfit to enter into the married
state.
MOTHER INTERFERES.
Henrietta Rodgers obtained a divorce
from Henry Rodgers on the ground of
desertion. The decree was granted by
Judge Graham after Mrs. Rodgers had
produced evidence showing that Rod
gers had deserted her and returned to
his mother. Emma Lyon obtained a
divorce from Frank E. Lyon in Judge
Murasky's court on the ground of
cruelty.
W. J. Downing of the Capitol Mills,
who is being sued for divorce by Tes
sie L. Downing, answered her com
plaint yesterday with a denial of her
charges of cruelty and in a cross-com
plaint asked that he be granted a de
cree on the ground of cruelty. He
says that ever since his marriage in
April of last year his wife has treated
him in a mean manner. He says she
would leave the house early in the
morning and remain away all day and
that during her absence he had to pre
pare his own meals. He charges furth
er that^Mrs. Downing frequently hurt
his feelings -by telling him that "he was
no good: that he was a 'bum and that
his father and mother were bums."
W. B. Harner. a railroad official, who
Is beinpr sued for divorce by Jennie
Clyde Harner, has agreed to pay his
wife $45 a month alimony during the
pendency of her .suit. He has also
agreed to pay her $50 counsel fees. The
agreement was filed yesterday.
the company say there will be no
trouble. Trouble is signified as violence
in this instance and the only Indica
tions that such trouble threatens is the
congregation of strikers in bunches and
special policemen, armed with pick
handles. Â»
All Is quiet along the Southern Pa
cific freight eheds, and that fact is due
to the orderly manner in Â¦which the
freight handlers conducted themselves
after going out on Ktrike and the pres
ence of Captain fpillane and a squad
of seventeen policemen.
Duaing the afternoon of yesterday ef
forts were made to get the billing
clerks to declare a strike in sympathy
Â¦vrltii the freight handlers, but that
xnox-ement failed. Checking clerks were
next appealed to. but they also refused
to stand by the men that load the cars.
In the latter case a vote was taken
and resulted in eighteen being in favor
of going out and twenty-eight refus
ing.
Special policemen guarded the yards
â¢while the men that were supposed to
load tiie cars were sleeping in the sheds
or in tourist cars, which were side
tracked for their benefit.
Each special officer was armed with
a pick handle and was supposed to use
It in the event of any attempt on the
part of the strikers to take the men
from their berths. No such attempts
â¢xcere made, and the men that have
gone out say that there will be no at
tempt at violence.
The company made a change In the
xnanacement of the sheds yesterday,

Stories are in circulation to the effect
that the teamsters are to join the
freight handlers. That Is not correct,
according to the officers of the Team
eters' Union. When their strike was
settled last yar an agreement was en
tered into which prevents any possi
bility of going: on strike, even in sym

Freight handlers do not make the
claim officially that the teamsters are

ST. LOUIS, June 6.â Chief of Police
George W. Wittman of San Francisco
was adopted this afternoon by 750 In
dians as an Indian chief. He was
named "Chief Popular With the Peo
ple."
Colonel Richard Plunkett of Nevada
was adopted as "Chief Afraid of No
Man."
The occasion was a special perform
ance at Cummins' Indian congress In
honor of the National Association or
Chiefs of Police, now in convention
here. The title of chief was conferred
upon several other notables. Including
William Pinkerton, the famous detec
tive, who was named "Chief Never
Sleep."
Of course the adoption of these men
by the Indians was an advertising
scheme, but it was a clever one, which
Wittman, Pinkerton and the others
honored willingly assisted In.

FRESNO,' June 6.â After seeking for
six long months to get revenge on the
man who cut him with a bread knife,
John Rigas at last looks with content
ment on Theros Chipperos behind pris
on ' bars. Ever since last December,
when â¢ Rigas was ba'Jly wounded by
Chipperos in a fray which occurred in
a- restaurant on Ninth street, between
Mission- and Market streets, In San
Francisco, where both were working,
he has hunted for his assailant to get
even. At last he heard from a friend
who knew nothing of the difficulty be
tween the two Greeks, and he said
Chipperos was employed at Millwood in
the logging camp. Rigas came Imme
diately to Fresno and â¢ informed the
Sheriff's office. After communicating
with the San Francisco authorities and
securing the warrant for the arrest of
Chipperos, Sheriff Collins sent a dep
uty to the mills. Rigas accompanied
the deputy in order to make no mistake
in identity.
A clever ruse was worked on the
Greek to arrest him. The clerk in the
store at Millwood sent for Chipperoa
to come to the place, on a matter of
business, as he supposed. He came,
saw Rigas and offered to shake hands.
When the officer saw there was no
chance of mistake he arrested his man.
Chipperos' eyes darted fire when he
saw how he had been tricked. The
officer brought the man to Fresno and
placed him in jail. Rigas preferred to
come back by stage and not take a
chance riding In the buggy with the
man who had injured him.
The row ever which the stabbing re
sulted occurred In San Francisco some
time last fall. Rigas has a scar more
than three inches long in the left side
of his abdomen which he says shall be
avenged.
Because she would not marry, him.
Flora Lewis, also known as "Flossie"
Lewis, will have to answer In the Jus-!
tices' court to a suit brought by B. M.
Eisner for recovery of an engagement
ring and other presents made by him
when their two hearts Beat as one.
Eisner is employed in the art glass
department of Moise & Klinker Co.,
Sacramento and Leldesdorff streets,
and lives with his mother at 730 De^
visadero street.
Â¦ According to the complaint filed by
the young man he alleges that in April.
1903, he and thÂ© fair plaintiff entered
into a contract to marry on a subSe
quent date and on September 20 of thÂ«
same year, the fact was announced to
the friends of both parties at an en-i
gagement reception, thereupon, Eis
ner says, he presented his fiancee with
a solitaire diamond ring valued at $150
and made her other presents. Includ
ing three steins worth $15, a cot. $5;
drawing instruments, $5, and cash,
$6 65.
* Eisner avers that Miss Lewis broke
off the engagement in April of this
year and returned all the presents the
couple had received frorn friends, but
did not return these he had given her.
The only unfavorable comment made
last night on Miss Lillian Sefton, the
Tivoli's new songstress, was uttered
In undertone by the large lady in the
third row left at the end of the first
act. . â¢
"Oh, look how clumsilv that bodice
is cut over the shoulders," said she to
her companion with the turquoise
brooch, "and a little applique of
watered satin ribbon would have set
off the decolette so effectively."
Others, not so censorious in matters
sartorial, had reason to believe that in
Miss Sef ton the Tlvoli had added to
the strength of its. company by so
much of sprightliness and real tuneful
ness that a matter of watered ribbon
applique cut no very considerable fig
ure. The notes that rippled from be
tween the- very even teeth of Sergeant
Kitty had the ring that causes the
flrst-nighters to sit up and take no
tice; the very graceful and verv win
ning little manners of Sergeant Kit
ty had the proper tone to them, were
quite as they ought to be and her ap
pearanoe was a success. A part very
like that which Lulu Glazer carried in
"Dolly Varden," with all the shy in
genuousness and ready effrontery of the
girl in the midst of military alarmsâ
this was Miss Sefton's role last night.
She sang and played it with a deal of
Lulu Glazer's own style; that should
be sufficient evidence of ability.
The musicaj comedy Itself is some
thing new to San Francisco, but not so
happy a novelty, perhaps, as the prima
donna soprano it served to Introduce.
The action moves along somewhat
"stodgily," with little pretense at any
great upward lift in the matter of sit
uations and manifesting only a filmy
aspiration to the claim of comedy. The
lyrics have some, dash to them, how
ever, and in one or two instances catch
the swing which gives cause for their
possibility of being dubbed popular.
"A Postilion's Life" and the bellicose
Hit about "War" have a git-up-and
git about them quite up to the demand
of the phonograph parlors.
Dora de Fillippe as Louise de Marl
lac, and Bessie Tannehill, comfortably
girt about In the voluminous folds of
severe old Aunt Angellque's skirts,
have opportunities, both of them, to
add their t*vo and three talents to the
Tivoli's well-stocked- mite box for the
public amusement. With Algernon
Aspland Miss de Fillippe sings a song
about the girl somebody else than
Johnny left behind him. Bessie Tanne
hill has the rare chance to be the foil
which sets off the diamond of Ferris
Hartman's chest notes in a duet of
philosophical Import. "Just Take
Things as They Come." Esther King
and Nettie Deglow also have a duet to
render, tidy enough. For the men, mu
sical matters are not arranged so lav
ishly. Arthur Cunningham, with Mils
military song, and George Chapmaji,
delegated to warble a solo and assist
in a duet, do not have the greatest
chance In the world to shine, but then
hiding one's light under a bushel for
a while but adds to its brilliance when
it is again allowed to 'send forth Us

LOS ANGELES, June 6.â Hon. James
W. Somers, a boyhood and lifelong
friend of the martyred Lincoln, was in

"I Intend to die unless you promise
to marry me," cried Elizabeth Sneffen,
a divorced woman, one day In Septem
ber, 1889, In the office of Dr. Albert
Noble, at that time a young prac
titioner, but now the house doctor
of the Palace Hotel.
The cry was uttered after she had
swallowed the contents of a bottle of
laudanum. Dr. Noble, who saw her
take the poison and to whom the plea
was made, was frightened and non
plused for the moment. Then he
dropped the stomach pump which he
had instinctively grabbed when he saw
the young woman take the bottle and
swore on a Bible that he would make
her his wife. Then he used the
stomach pump and saved the woman's
life. The next day she .became Mrs.
Noble.
Yesterday the marriage was an
nulled by Judge Hebbard on complaint
of the doctor. The latter's evidence,
which included the above remarkable
tale, proved that the . unfortunate
woman was insane at the time of their
marriage. It was also shown that
Mrs. Noble had been committed to the
Asylum for the Insane at . Agnew in
January. 1901, and was at present an
inmate of the institution.
Mrs. Noble was represented in court
by her brother, John A. Sherburne,
who has been appointed her guardian
for the purpose of the suit and who
as her guardian announced that the
property rights of his sister had been
settled out of court. (
