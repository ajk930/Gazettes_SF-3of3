; Judge Hart, addressing the prisoner

had been heavy. He had been expelled

awaited him in the sentence 'required
by his conviction at the hanfls of a

Judge Hart said he bad I watched
Bunkers' conduct "in the court and on

showed he had no conception ; of the
enormity of. the charge upon which he
, -n as being tsf cd. - The JudgÂ« said he

Dr. C. F: Pawlicki Jr. was" asked for
his resignation as an Emergency Hos
pital surgeon last night. Df. James W,
Ward, president of the Board of Health,
says that. he alone is responsible for the
action. Ward refused to give any rea
son for^ his action, and "says that no
charges* have - been" preferred against
Dr. Pawlicki.' "The change is for the
betterment, of the hospital service," he
said. "We thought it a good change all
around. The majtter will be finally act
ed upon by the whole board. I consult
ed no One in arriving at my decision."
Dr.. J. I. Stephen, chief surgeon-of the
hospitals, was ordered by Dr. Ragan,
Health Offlcer, to" ask Pawlicki for his
resignation. He was wroth that the
Health Board . had not taken him into
its -confidence. "I am a .bigger power
politically than Dr.. Raganj" he said,
"and I am extremely sore that I was
not taken into the confidence of those
who were responsible ' for expelling
Pawlicki." . â¢ " â¢ '
Dr. .Simon of the Health Board was
equally put out and spoke some of re
signing. "They should have told me
why Pawlickl's resignation was asked
for," he said, "for I am in charge of
the hospitals. I do not like this way
of doing business." Dr. Stephen, in
speaking of Simon's anger, said he
would perhaps resign himself.
"Not a' member of the Health Board
had. any inkling of Ward's proposed
action -and all expressed much surprise
at Pawllcki'e removal. . -
It ts said that Dr., F. J. TiHman will
be appointed : to fill the vacancy made
by Dr. Pawlicki's resignation.

The question > Ist -'asked : . "Where did
the \u25a0* money -come ; from which enabled
James B. Smith Â£tal repay the parties
who advanced him;' $100,000 / one ' year
ago ?" There is a .very strong suspicion
among politicians that ; the coin, llf| It
ever reached the Treasurer's office, .was
taken out again as j soon as | thedanger
of exposure passed. '% There , is \u25a0 hardly a
doubt that the Tax Collector;had-con
federates at ; the : City j Hall % who I kept
him advised as to ; the | probable] inten
tions of the Mayor and Grand Jury./ ;
In due time the . Grand " Jury ; may be
able to from/ well-informed,
bankers all : the j details : connected | with
the alarming rush one/year \u25a0 ago ': which
ended in , the raising? of; sl6s,ooo to
bridge over the delinquencies" of the
Tax Collector.: The bankers -may; not
care to "talk for publication," , but they,
might be constrained^ through ; a" spirit
of civic patriotism- to; impart Informa
tion* in confidence to the Grand;. Jury."
The banks cannot lose anything, -as
they hold securities of gilt-edge/char
acter for ; money \u25a0; advanced.; : The^ city,
it' is said, will not ; lose,/ as the '.surety
company.' has announced /a to
make good its bond. The' story ; of the
defalcation as told in April,: 1904;\tothe
Rosenfelds would surely j>rove: interest-"
ing.. Enterprising merchants who knew
one year ago what the /Grand . Jury ; is
now trying .to find ';. out may .be \ per
suaded to divulge. \u25a0 - ,
:'\u25a0'- There is t an, impression ,*in Â» banking
circles . that the -; amount of \u0084 money
which the Tax Collector squandered on
women of the half- world : and slow
horsds is overestimated. ; The defaulter
had some} method f^n juggling -wKhjthe
public : funds'; In one of the city^ banks
he deposited the.sunvof, $50,000., Checks
were occasionally j drawn jon \ the I bank
and other deposits were made. Finally
all ! the money to, the credit of the Tax
Collector was checked out and/no fur
ther deposit was made. ' The banker
calls to mind that nothing ; was ever
said to Smith, in words "or. flgures,/con- ;
cerning the trivial^ matter of interest."
Rumor to the effect that James B.
Smith is a directori In the American
National Bank is not correct. The : fact
seems .to be that E.J. Smith deposited
large sums of I money in that bank. He
deposited small sums in other "banks.
The American National Bank and' the
London and San Francisco Bank, it Is
said, extended accommodations .to
James B. Smith, taking as security^the
gilt-edged bonds and stocks which the
Smiths borrowed from their friends in
business circles. 5 , \u25a0 ' - / V
â¢ The fact can be proved that James
B. Smith did raise a sum approximat
ing $165,000, ostensibly for the purpose
of enabling the Tax Collector to make
a settlement with* the Treasurer. |It
can be proved also that one well-known
business man who put up securities to
the value of $100,000 to \ help the Smith
brothers in , their pecuniary distress
was reimbursed.- Shortly after the res
cue j act was performed his stocks and
bonds were released '\u25a0. and returned to
him. The story goes that JohnSÃosen
feld's Sons accommodated James B.
Smith with a loan of $65,000, and there
Is an impression that this amount Is
still due them from; Smith, although
they ' are fully protected by securities
pledged for the repayment of the
money, j , .
There is a mystery connected with
the defalcation and flight of: E. J.
Smith, the late Tax. Collector, which
the Grand Jury and the experts are' not
able apparently to solve. "According \to
the gossip in banking circles and the"
stories told on the street the large
amount of money which was put up in
April, 1904. to shield the Tax Collector,
from exposure and' arrest must have
been paid back to the parties who
loaned James B.- Smith the securities
on'which the" coin was borrowed from
banks and individuals. . ~

ed with people, who; did'not spare their
criticism â¢ of ; whati was ; generally, termed
unnecessary Vslaughter.s %; The "popular

soldiers j evidently were .' nervous,' and
open outbreaks, resulting . in \u25a0 a repeti
tion^ of yesterday*" terrible ecenes,were
averted only by ; the evident -desire of
the ,. authorities to prevent , a clash,

ter against the,, military,', and the Gov

The Polish press Is silent on the sub
i ject of yesterday's events. The official
Russian paper prints * a short : and en

Reports conflict regarding the begin
ning of yesterday's encounter in Jeru
salem- street. " According toVthe most
generally accepted version 1 the authori
ties^had forbidden the carrying of red"
flags by workmen marching in the pro- }
cession,' but the workmen decided to Ig
nore the - order.; ; When the procession
reached Jerusalem street the police or
dered "the' workmen \to' stop, but they
refused ?\to f dp\Â«o; and a police officer
thereupon" flred a revolver, giving a
signal for the i Infantry to flre. It ap
pears ; that in ! other cases \u25a0 the demon
strators were the aggressors, but' that
in <thls instance i the soldiers fired first.
â¢ The* Industrial * population, is deeply
exasperated over Uhe sanguinary re
suits of ] encounter. The
strikes inaugurated \u25a0: on a ' large scale
here, . in ' Lodz and '\u25a0 in \u25a0 oth#r cities are
rapidly spreading. 1 and ,75,000. persons
are out *on strike lin \u25a0 Lodz. Cossacks
are patrolling r j the 1 streets^ of i Warsaw

ger to smaller detachments. ?
In Lodz, according to ; an i official re
port," four" women were r killed.'

at 5 o'clock 'to-day" with that military
pomp which 'traditionally ; niark3 an
EmbasaadpVs -first meeting .with the
head of the. republic. X.T. .i'
Shortly before^ the-- hour of the recep
tion \u25a0a - squadron of cuirassiers, ; In steel
breast plates arid helmets, galloped up
to tlie . American^ embassy. ."With : them
were three : state coaches bearing Mol
lard, the Introducer of Embassadors,
"and Baron ' Roujeaux^representlns tha
Foreign Office and- the* Presidential
household. Within the, embassy McCor- ,
mick and -the entire staff' of the; em
bassy, : In 'evening â¢drescr,\with;- Captain
Bentley \u25a0' Mott, .the *' military} attaohe,
and Lieutenant Commander,:. Roy T.
Smith, -the naval in' full uni
form, awaited the- French officials.
Embasiador McCormick 'and- f Mollard
entered .the ; first "coach r ,a sumptuous
vehicle.*, emblazoned with the arms of
the republic ,^and drawn "by a pair of
handsome bays with richly gilded har
ness , and coachmen and outriders in
full" state livery. The party swung
through the avenues with lines of cul- :
rassiers stretching from curb to curb
and 1 flanking ' the Embassador'9 coach.
; Throngs lined the Champs ElysSe to
, see, the showy equipages pass.
,; Arriving at the palace of the Elysee.
a brilliant picture was presented by lons
lines of infantry 5 making a complete Â«
circuit of the palace court. As the Em
bassadorial party drove within the cir
cuit of. Infantry the band took . up the
national American anthem and the
French . flag was : dipped , in salute. The
reception , : occurred in the Salon dea
Embassadoures, where President Lou
bet was assisted by Foreign Minister
Delcasse and a number of officials. Del
casse introduced the Embassador, who
was cordially greeted by the President.
' In presenting, his credentials McCor
mick spoke of . the centuries of friend
ship uniting France and the Unitejl
States In an alliance more enduring
than. that of treaties. He referred also
to the recent closer feeling of friend
ship between France and the mother
republic. These feelings of friendship.
he said, were of the greatest Jbeneflt to [
commercial and pacific interests, which
are those of the progressive world.
President Loubet in replying said
France had no prouder heritage than
her participation in the work wMch\
brought the powerful American nation-*
Into being. More than a century's test
had not 7 been able to \u25a0 interrupt tha
friendship first established.
As Embassador McCormick withdrew
the American anthem was again heard,
and "the party was escorted with mili
tary ceremonies back to * the
embassy. \u0084

contention *of the defense that it was
Young who opposea breaking the rela

It is a duty which every community owes to itself to sup-
port and encourage home production. By virtue of their ente r-

for himself and Stewart one-quarter

forever, to the Catholic church of Cali

\u25a0 \u2666STEWART'S FAT FEE.
Doyle*. It is said, once offered Mrs.
Troy. $250 'as a compromise.
..It is surmised that had the case gone
\u25a0 to trial the defense' would have been
made that Senator White had no right
â¢to ,use his ofllcial position In the col
lecting of claims, that the statute of
. limitations had run acainst the claim
and* that the actual contract for three
â¢months that had been entered Into wito
Senator White expired long before the
collection of Ihe sum received.
As *a matter of fact,- the -best, work
fione by. White for the claim was after
the expiratfon of the contract, and the
value of the services* were acknowl
edged by Doyje as late^ Â«s January of
last year, thus 4 barring the statute of
limitations.
* In face of the fact that White's acts
* There, vould- have been introduced
"in evidence, had the case gone to trial.
â¢ numerous letters from Doyle to White,
acknowledging "the services, of the lat
. ter in securing, the award." It would
I have ,been,;shojvn that it was .White
S -wKo induced the American State De J
partment ,to make a demand upon the
republic, of -Mexico' for the amount of
the claim, without which demand Tha
Hatrue -tribunal could have taken no
cognizance of it. Among the letters
Introduced in- evidence was one from
Judge William R. *of the State
Department, written"in October. 1897,
informing him-- that a'f his (White's)
request he-had sent the demand to the
Mexican Minister.
J.ohn T. Doyle was in court- and At
torney Philip G. CJalpin represented
him. When Attorney Troy appeared
et 10 o'clock Attorney - Galpin ap
proathed him. and said the defense
wished to make a proposition for a
compromise. .These two -and Attorney
Delma's retired, being granted permis
sion " to' do for fifteen "minutes by
Judge Buck. They consulted in the
Judge's chambers.
The first proposition made by Gal
! pin was promptly rejected by Delmas
and Troy. The three went before
Judge "Buck and secured an extension
of time. Th.ey repeated this several
limes, the. conference continuing until
2 . o.'clock,' with an intermission for
lunch.eon. Judge Buck patiently wait
ing in the courtroom.
When the agreement was reached
J Attorney D*Mmas made a motion that
I the suit be dismissed. â¢ Judge Buck at
.â¢ once made the order-and the case was
ended. * V.*'._
- Had the case gone to trial the plain-
; tifl would -have submitted testimony to
show that Senator William M. Stew
art of Nevada and Attorney John T.
Doyle had ; an agreement with Arch
bishop Rio'rdan and the Bishop of
Monterey and". Los" Angeles to receive
one-quarter of the total sum awarded;
that Doyle employed Senator White
to assist them, agreeing to give him
one-third of what was received; that
$.125.000,'..0r.562.500 each, was award
Â«ed Stewart and Doyle by the Arch
'bishpp^ The sum sued for -is below
the*amt>unt that would be actually
* due.
It ?vas expected that the trial would
last several "days and that during its
progress' much concerning the methods
of stcuringr the pious fund award that
had never been published would come
cut. ,Two , United States Senators,
.White and Stewart, were, working to
eecuraibe settlement, . and after it was
mad,e there was a stormy dispute be
tween attorneys aad church dignitaries
aver what- was due 'as fees. The laying
bare of ajl the. proceedings, it was sur
mised*, would prove of interest to the
public. \u0084 â¢
The compromise so suddenly effected
in the little county seat of" San Mateo
has 'closed the last of the disputes over
the disbursement of the money.
Robert P. r. Troy and D. M. Delmas
were present at the Sah Mateo court
yesterday to represent Mrs. Troy.
There \yere also present to appear as
witnesses for her J. Wiseman McDon

HALFMOON' BAY, May 2.âConsid
erable has been manifested In
the appearance of another newspaper
in^Halfmoon 'Bay. \The new journal is
accepted as an evidence, of the prog
ress ' and â¢ prosperity of the town. The
new paper, is called the Halfmoon Bay
Review. ,It is published by . H. E. Griff
iths, "and is a neat" and newsy sheet. ;
The Review has a rival in! the Coast
Advocate, .which," under, the .direction
of. : Lester J. Skidmore.has long , been
one , of : the = most potent influences f or
good in the community.-* , ..
'.The 'announcement ':. that Halfmoon
Bay; is- soon to have; a' bank. ls consid
ered as further evidence of the prosper
ity; of thÂ« town. ' The town' certainly
needs such an 'institution : for : the con
venience of ".its merchants, whose trade
has of . late been increasing 'very rap
idly. . . '- ."â¢
REDWOOD CITY. May 2.â Road
'building, prospective and speculative,
from San Francisco to Santa - Cruz
along the coast is creating exceptional
interest in this and other towns in
San Mateo County.. Tire presence and ;
activity of rival surveying parties, the
known interest of the ' Southern Pacific
Company and. the suspected opposition
of i other great railway - corporations
have created no end of gossip. - : -
It is announced from a source which
is * practically f otHclal that ' the rival -of
the Southern Pacific _â¢ Company . for
rights of ~way that will give authority
'to tap the â¢ rich Pescadero and Half
moon Bay districts is not the Western
Pacific Railroad-Company, but -the
Bowen interests, under whose direc
tion the /electric i railroads of Sonoma
County .were constructed. The sur
veying parties ; now; operating along
i the coast under the direction -of John
Rodgers . represent . Bowen; Â» They are
not surveying for a steam railroad
from San Francisco to Santa Cruz, but
for an electric road, . which rwill be
; fully as 7 good for passengers . and
i freight as a steam line and may be
constructed much more cheaply and
quickly.
The rights of way are almost com
plete and the promise is made that at
the -expiration of a year an electric
passenger and - freight road will be In*
operation from San Francisco to Half
moon Bay. Further than this it la
promised that the road \u25a0 will . be com
pleted to Santa Cruz in two years,
tapping. one of the richest districts in
California. â¢
' As a guarantee of good faith two
valuable /properties in the Halfmoon
Bay district necessary to the construc
tion of the road have been acquired,
one by purchase and the other under
bond. J. B. Goldman of San Francis
co was the ostensible principal in
both transactions.. He has bought for
$21,000 the George ranch of eighty
acres,* about half a mile from. Half
moon Bay. on the road to Amesport
Landing, and he has bonded, for $40,
000 the; Madonna ranch, which is*
north of. Halfmoon Bay. Both prop-,
erties arc- on the line of the proposed
electric railroad.

was pronounced a "cigar-store statue"
by Patrolman F. McQuaid, who ac
feused' him of vagrancy. V
It was explained that in police par
lance a "cigar-store statue" is a male
person who manages to. eat, sleep and
dress well and have no apparent
legitimate means of so doing. Mr.
Weinberg. who, t>ie policeman stated.
Is a fair sample of < a large number of
young men thus conditioned, made
himself especially obnoxious by con
fining his loafing to one block,
bounded by Stockton, Ellis, Powell
and O'Farrell streets, where he flitted
from cigar store to cigar store as the
butterfly flits from flower to . flower.
It was his wont. to stand at the doors
of the tobacco shops, 7 posed in as
graceful an attitude as his dlspropor
tioned limbs would permit blowing
cigarette smoke through' his nostrils
and ogling such passing women as
caught his fancy. The. officer had
noted and shadowed him, but failed
to find an honest source of his liveli
hood, and the only reasonable Infer
ence to be drawn was , that some
woman of the under. world maintained
film In Idleness/^SiS
Judge . Mogan gave" Mr. Weinberg
until this morning to present proofs
that he 'ls not what the policeman al
leged, and Intimated that failure to
do so .would be rewarded with a long

guirty of drunkenness and acknowl
edged, that he was under the influence
of aleohelic intoxicants when Patrol
man "Charlie" Brown arrested him last
Saturday 'evening at Commercial and

averred, was not prompted by love of

vocation of "porter in a Third street sa

Caucasian spirits, .and he would have

ped on the wet sidewalk and fell into a
plate glass window, which was shat
tered. Rain was falling in torrents
at the time and enough of it to spoil.
$100 worth of goods blew into : the
hole made by Mr. Weir. Patrolman
. Arey, who made the arrest, opined
that Mr. Weir was intoxicated, but
Judge Mogan expressed willingness to
Ignore that opinion rif the defendant
would pay for the damage. he inflicted,
a- suggestion which was adopted on
the spot. '; Mr. Weir and the officer
started at once for Oakland, where
the former had more than $100 on

â two hours later than the time pre
scribed by ordinance for the cessation
of instrumental music in licensed wet

shut out the discord he entered the
place and found Mr. Icardo himelf
torturing the | piano and two nautical
gentlemen endeavoring -to dance ; to.
the irregular tempo. But the piano
fighter only was arrested. In the
court of Judge Fritz the defensive plea
was ignorance of the law, but his
Honor opined that such ignorance was
inexcusable, and Mr. Icardo was .in
a fair way to be fined when Mr. Joy
hinted that his license is likely to be
revoked, so the case was passed up
to the Police Commissioners.

â¢npHE eÂ«Torcement of the child labor law is producing consid T
I. I erable embarrassment. In Oakland it appears that so many
children, approaching the age limit of 14 years are being sent
back tG the sch.ools that there is not room for them. They appear
to be children who, starting in school at 5 years of age, have wearied
of books after years of study, and have sought activity in work; and
faking themselves useful in various ways. The law, however,
forbids fhem to. make themselves ; useful, and they must go back
to school or fall. into the hands of the truant officer and' the Juvenile
Court. * * . .
In-." this,. situation they find the schoolroom-insufficient to; ac
commodate them, and ; are in somewhat of a quandary what to ; do.
One thing is sure : Idleness ; is moral poison ; to a boy between 12.
and 14 *y ears Â°^ a S*Â« He habits be acquired tnenrt their eradica
tion is difficult, and the victim is likely -to go from worse Â«to ; worst.
The school 'accommodations in ; all i large American cities are : inade
qu ate for the. accommodation of all the pupils who are entitled to
in&ructjo'n. The people may as well face the fact and prepare to
make \u25a0 the schools ample^ for all who should be in \ them. With our
child labor law in # operation, and boys compelled to quit work
while there is no room for them at school, it means that they must
be .put* under some sortj of police espionage, which is itself bad. It
is the;.beginning of a penalizing process. A boy who knows that
he is Tviratched by an'officer- learns to "dodge,- and that is a bad lesson.

All the Italians and Italian-Ameri
cans in our State know that no such

NO "MAFIA" HERE.
"THE SIMPLE LIFE."
George P. Brett, president of the Mac
milian Company, writing in The "World
To- Day for May of Jhe tendency to
eulogize the "simple life," takes excep
tion to the preaching- of : thls doctrine
and says: The conditions of life Jin
America have been too easy for us in
the . past Our days begin In the kin
dergarten with play and song and
legend. Instead of honest toll and real
achievement, and our later life is
given up too much to senseless amuse
ments and â¢ sensational pleasures, with
the result that our "moral fiber has be^
comeTfiabby, and our public, conscience
has gone t6-"j"sleep: "Dishonesty?. and
malfeasance in public life no longer
shock and horrify us as they should,
and the public press treats of the
scandalous â¢ matters above referred to
merely from the standpoint of sensa
tionalism. We no longer stand aghast
that such things â¢ can be and ' have
come to believe that honesty is not
"even the best policy, in deflance'of the
early teachings of our 'copybooks. â¢
It has been truly* said that what ia
everybody's business is the business of
no j one, and -herein lies one of the
great dangers of a republic, wh#re
every one is of equal' lmportance and
influence. in the eye bf the law. 'This
danger is an increasing one in these
days , of enormous aggregations of
population, when the voice of the In
dividual counts less and has less"'
â¢weight because of the crowded condi
tions of our ' modern city life. â¢ The
tendency is for each bf us to go hi.?
own way, attending strictly to his own
affairs, .burdensome enough usually
for the strength of the man engaged
in 'active business life. I venture to
enter! my protest against the message
"which" Charles Wagner and Mr. Hllty
bring ; arid urge -â¢ that .It be disre
garded In favor bf an attitude bf mind \u25a0
much more needed at this "time, which
is a spirit of criticism and doubt as to'
the infallible goodness of existing: con
ditions and a . discontent In view of
these; many evils, which ia the first
step toward their cure.
WHY is'it that when a man ;falls
In love he longs to do something
j grand and heroicâ to distinguish
1 himself in' some way .that Is quite
I apart from daily .routine, the business
I by which he earns his; living, or even
from his recogriized life .work? :
, The sculptor may essay- poetry, for
instajjee, , as Thomas Woolner, R. A.,
j did in our own day; for the sake of his
I "Beautiful; Lady," or the painter may
do likewise; emulating Raphael bf .'the
\u25a0 renaissance.Uhe single volume of whose
1 love sonnets was lost so mysteriously
! at the time of \u25a0 Guido Reni's death. \u25a0 â¢ ,
; The poet may try, to worship 'through
the art of .brush or pencil, as Dante
did when he endeavored to trace the
likeness of his -angelic Beatrice. And
! even the ordinary man' cf the common
place, every-day world seeks some holi
day method of expressing the .deep
feeling which love has awakened in
: him.

For whatever we give; to the world,
must in, the ; nature : of become in
some degree 1 common, because of; : the
essential commonness ; of ; the world t; to
which we give; it. 'As' the .poet :sug

of any final triumph."- /

that sings '". but once .only in all - her

INVESTIGATIONS made by the Grand Jury, and the District
'Attorney show a remarkable condition of : irresponsibility in
jthe handling of public money in this "city. 'The late Tax Col
lector, under the circumstances, has'reasons, like Lord Clive, for
being amazed at his moderation. It appears that at, times $2,000,000
0^; poblic. money was subject to his. personal check, and only the
weight of it .stood in the way of his taking it all.
-Â« t His bond of $100,000 was totally inadequate under such: cir
cumstances. No one seems to have known' how much money he
had under, his .purely personal control, or where it was or what
.might have happened to it. Utter lack of oversight caused him to
dine and sup and sleep and wake with temptation and opportunity
.always by his side. His moral fiber was weak anyway, and was
known to' be weak . by? every officer of the city. His record was
.such -as to inspire watchfulness of his courses. But lie; seems to
have been as free of inspection and oversight as though occupied en-
, tirely in bis private business.. Indeed, he was more free, for men
in prjvate business are responsible on all sides, to the Board. of
\yorks, .the Board of Health and various other depositaries of official
authority, but the Tax Collector seems to have been responsible to
no one.
.His clerks, doubtless relying on "influence" for their places,
were ordered by him to .neglect their duty, to shut sometimes one
.eye and eometimes both, in regard to, tax collections, for as he ex
, plained he wanted the tax office to be popular. \ Well, it was popu
lar, very popular. He seems to have originated the plan of going
1 him self to large taxpayers and taking their checks payable to his
crder. â¢ AVhat legal right had he to do this and to receipt for taxes
outskie of. the office? If such right exist it should be withdrawn.
f There is no need for that method in this city. In our large country
. -counties the' Tax Collector advertises his future presence in places
remote, from the county seat for the purpose of receiving taxes and J
â¢ giving receiplSi. This is done for the convenience of the people and j
10 isave the time and expense of a long journey. It is public arid i
aboveboard. But. there is no need of it here. It costs only a;
, ifickerto go from any part of San Francisco to the tax office, and
if the iax agent of the Southern Pacific had invested that much j
money in the journey, the Tax Collector- could not- have Â»^tolen- the 'l
last, installment of the taxes of that corporation. \
That feature of the case requires examination and correction, j
Taxes .should be paid publicly, at the tax office, in business hours,,
a;id not on the street or in downtown offices. We are all busy. in!
locking- the. stable door after the horse is stolen. * We are also 1
all appalled at the go-as-you-please .official methods, as revealed by ]
this crinre. We pay $6,000,000 or $7,000,000 a year in taxes to ,
maintain a municipal government to attend to our business for us. !
We elect the members of that government, they take office and our I
interest ceases. "Treasurers steal and Tax Collectors embezzle be- 1
cause no. "one" watches them.' When they steal the Mayor is asked'
why he did' not watch things, and he passes the responsibility up to
the Finance Committee of- the Board of Supervisors ; that com- j
ihittee p^Sses it on to the Treasurer, and he to the Auditor and he <
back to the Mayor. All that the people learn about it is that no
one seems -to be responsible". When an examination, takes place,
sugh-as is jx>w' under way, the public records are found 'higgledy- !
piggledy, in a condition that would not be tolerated in the bookkeep- 1
ing of a peanut- stand, and we have one brief hour of indignation and
then settle' down and wait for the next default.
* \u0084 This is^all^a part of the system and the policy of the political
push. 'It .is tq . have the public, money in such custody, the public
.accounts in such condition, and responsibility impossible of loca
tion, that the runs, the primaries and stuffs" ballot-boxes. It
is for' <*uch -ends that party conventions are programmed, and have I
ceased to/oe deliberative bodies. ,As long as decent people turn 1
their : /b'atks .on the primaries just so long will exist the risk of J
theft',, erabezzlement â¢ and malfeasance in office, and, wantons will
flaunt the gauds that are paid for by the stolen money of the people,
and public authority and custody of the public cash will be likely to
fall to* unscrapulous voluptuaries, to whom fidelity and duty are
mere .words, signifying- nothing.
One, disclosure after another has. revealed the need of the'
people attending, to their own business by concerning themselves
with what goes on in their municipal government. The Republican
League,' while a belated expression of the civic conscience, is wel
come *asf a high resolve to do better. It means that men represent
ing the decent -majority of the city are willing to give their time and
talents to an organization that will keep an eye on public affairs.
It .fneans that 'from the: primary to the convention, and from the
conVentiom to the election,, and from the election through the offi
cial tjerm of every public officer, there shall be a\ guard'. mounteel
over. the public business. No more men of such character, that the
penitentiary is their natural destination shall be permitted to reach
it via public *office in San Francisco. 4 Let them practice dishonesty I
in the private station and take the consequences, and not drag the I
city's 'good name in the gutter. â¢ j

whfen'the *nusic .was changed to
"Dixie," followed by "Good-by, Little
Girl, "Good-by." Jt was nearly 1
o'clock before, the .Sherman cast off
her lines. Major Devol has always
pride<l himself on the promptness of

regulation .'time at 12 o'clock noon.
This " time, â¢ however, while all the
iroops "were on board early in the day,
tbe baggage of the Ninth Infantry was
late in coming" to the dock. The de
lay <vas caused .by all* sorts of circum

next by. trouble in getting, the bag
gage away. from Oakland mole. .

school for Japanese pupils a suitable
school be established in some j central
location for. the aid of backward stu
dents of whatever parentage and ' na

such a course will result in the great
er efficiency of * the schools:: and A also
be of great advantage to a large num
ber of young people other than .Jap
anese -who are backward in ; English
branches. The petition g continues :
Â£ We deprecate any i action , which -would de
prive ' the younger Japanese children,; most . of
whom were born In this country, of i the ad*
vantages of our common school system. 8i It Is
due to our country as wÂ«ll as to those children
of other foreign - parentage that they .be "al

Japanese children by their cleanly and studious
habits have shown . themselves worthy; of as

board of directors, which kept up
some show of interest. The ballot was
built upon the plan of the municipal
ballot, giving the ladies an object.k#
son in the art of putting their crosses
where they would do the most goo.l.

Mrs. Pinkham's Standing Invitation.
~ : Women suffering from any form of
female weakness are invited to promptly .
communicate with Mrs. Pinkham, at
Lynn, Mass. All letters are received,
opened, read and answered by women
only. A' woman can freely talk of her
private illness to a woman ; thus has
been established the eternal confidence
between" Mrs. Pinkham and the women
of America which has never been
:'. broke*. Out of the vast volume of
I experience which she has to draw from,
I it is more than possible that she has
i gained the very knowledge that will
| kelp your case. She asks nothing in
return" except your good- will, and her
advice has relieved thousands. Surely
any woman, rich or poor, is very foolish
i if she does not take advantage of this
generous offer of assistance. . ,
* If sou are ill, don't hesitate to get a
bottle of Lydia E. Pinkham'sVege table
Compound at once, and write Mrs. Pink-
.ham, Lynn; Mass., for special advice.
' When a medicine has been successful
in restoring to health so many women, '
you cannot well say,* without trying it,
" I do not believe it will help me." .

"a* short breath aiter exercise,
palpitation, flutterragj weak or
â¢hungry spells, painin breast,
sfde or shoulder, or. uneasiness,
when. lying on left side, you
should talfe *Dr. Miles' Heart

reHeve all these symptoms. ,
â¢ If no.t promptly restored,;
chronic heart disease soon 'de-
velops, ami-then it only remains
for some sqdden strain to com-!
pfetely exhaust the* heart. ;
Thousands of hopeless cases
have been cured, and if you do
not try it, it will be the great-
est mistake of your life.- .
"When I began taking :' Dr. > Mfles*,

' SEATTLE, May 2.â Seattle rubbed
it Into Portland to-day at the bat and
In the field. Score â Seattle, 9; Port
land, 3. Although Williams was wild
the Portland men could not hit him
to advantage with men on bases. On
the other hand. Jones got a severs
drubbing. Better batting was done off
him than off any pitcher since the lo
cals reached home.
. The heavy hitting was started by
Williams in the third, when a three
base " smash scored two runs. Van
Buren -was strange tp> flr3t and his
work showed it. Kan* made several
long drives, with twoÂ«trlples, but Da
vis called him out on one of themi
The next time up. however, he hit tha
ball ao far that there was no question
about his being entitled to third.
â¢Big McLean did not show up In
good form. He let a perfect assist go
between his legs and was almost as
sloppy as Schlafley in his work. Riiss
Hall made Seattle's only error. Seat
tle took a lead of three runs In the
first Inning and again in the sixth,
scoring four runs on three hits amd
three errors, and was never headed
afterward. The score:

STANDING OF THE CLUBS.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CINCINNATI. May 2.â lmmediately
after his present week's engagement in
Cincinnati in the role of Davy Crockett
Champion James J. Jeffries will 'go to
Chicago to fill an engagement of one
week. This will be his last public ap
pearance. One week from next Mbnday
in Chicago is the time set by him to
day for his permanent retirement, both
as a fighter and an actor.
This afternoon Jeffries received word
from Klaw & Erlanger releasing him
from all his theatrical contracts and en
gagements. This action was taken at
the request of Jeffries, . who then made
the following statement:
"I may possibly take a summer trip
to Europe with my wife, after which
I am going into the mining business
with my brother Jack, and I shall here
after devote my time to it. The prin
cipal reason for my retiring from the
ring and from the stage is that my
wife objects to them. That has been
the controlling Influence in my reach-
Ing this determination. I have decided
to quit fighting for all time. The last
fight I had in San Francisco. was fairly
well patronized, and although I won
the big end of the purse there was but
little in it for me. I have determined it
is nob worth while to go into the ring
any more. The public is fickle. I am
well provided with this, world's goods,
and I am done with it! all. Billy De
laney Is also well fixed and he will also
retire from the business with me. When
my engagement ends., in Chicago, one
week from next . Monday, I shall make
my last, bow as a public character and
shall never again go on the stage or in
the prize ring."

The- Japanese baseball, forces were
routed \u25a0; at ' Recreation "Park - yesterday
when the. Stanford University nine won
Its : second game from the Waseda Uni
versity players by a score of 3 to 1.
" The : representatives' 4 : at the . Mikado
i are weakest at. the bat, being unable
to connect- with . the curve ball which
'ftas reached Buch a high state of de
velopment". In this country. \u25a0 The Japs
I play a sharp, snappy fielding game. It
is predicted their style of, play will be
revolutionized during their Eastern trill
and that they will get harder and hard
er- to beat as they pick up the finer
points of the" game. ...This they are do-
Ing rapidly. \u0084 '*
Catcher Yamawaka pegged the ball
1 to second and caught several runners
In their efforts to pilfer the bag. Third
Baseman Suyama made some brilliant
stops and throws to . the first bag.
Stanford played a clever fielding game,
making but few miscuea.' The slippery
condition" of * the diamond , made the
footing uncertain. Nearly 3000 spec
tators witnessed the game, the majority
being Japanese. - While they did not
always applaud at the right, time, they
showed a deep ? Interest : In the game
and were quick to see the clever plays.
:. The only run for the Japs came In
the eighth round. Pitcher Rook passed
Obara, who was advanced to second
on- the first hit of the game for the
Japs, made by Yamawaka, the catcher.
Pitcher. Rook threw the ball away at
the second . and both men advanced a
bag.' Obara then scored on a passed
ball. The plays, came. in rapid succes
sion and the spectators were on their
feet cheering lustily.
Stanford's ' first run came In the
fourth inning. After Fenton and Rook
were out : via ' the third to first route.
Presley, drew a pass. He quickly stole
second and reached home when . the
guardian of the third sack allowed
Lewis' hit to go through . hinu' his only
mlscue during the game. | Lewis re
tired the side by* beirs ciught stealing
second. Stanford made two more In
the fifth and \u0084 then quit for the day.
Kane's two-base hit, the longest of the
day, did the business. Trowbridge" was
safe on, the .'first baseman's error and
stole second. Stott " hit and went to
second on the throw to the infield. Bell
then lined the ball | out just ' Inside the
right field foul line and the two runners
trotted home. Bell was caught out at
the plate on Dudley's. hit to right field.
Fenton flew out" and retired the side.
The score: 1
When * "Handridlnig" Kelly has
ceased to shine as a star his grand,ef
' fort â¢\u25a0 on --Cruzados,- favorite -in the

, Sad Sam catching the wind first ,
Rounding the far turn Kelly threw
his tiller hard over, making a tack to
the* windward instead: of coming; on
the leeward of Sad Sam. Nearing the
bend for home the latter horse caught
an offshore breeze, which carried him
wide, t taking ' the favorite along, too.
FOUNTAIN liANDS j GOLD ENAMEL.
Fountain hugged the coast line with
Gold -Enamel and in a drive received
a; neck verdict over the first choice,
whose skipper had crowded .:, on ' '. all
canvas and brought the auxiliary en
gine into action. High Chancellor,

,The track was. in fairly good condi

two favorites were successful.
I'm Joe, favorite for the two-year
old event, was beaten by Daruma, the
second - choice. %_ Napa Stock Farm'Â»
fleet filly, excellently ridden by Lloyd
Fountain, displayed some of her old
time vim and dash, : outstaying and
downing* the first choice by a length.
Graham finished third with Lorena
M. a"2O to,l shot. ;..--\u25a0 ' \u25a0 :. . .
Following came the thirteenth re
newal of, the Soupbone stakes, which
went to Henry Clay Rye, the mount
of Otis. Dandie; Belle, backed from 8
to 5, ran second, half a: length -before
the : lukewarm choice,' Silurian.; Her-_
mencla.ran a disappointing. race. ' .
CIRCUS BEATS \ M ARELIO.
. It was current gossip that the subway
crowd would put Pachuca over the
plate : winner of the mile and a six
teenth selling affair. .AIL the 6 to 1 laid
about the mare was pulled up by the
roots \u25a0 early, and she led , to the pad
dock. If Knapp, who. rode the favor
ite, Marelio, had gone , on about his
business, there was no chance to beat
the gelding. But he didn't, and Bock,
closing strongly on the rail with Cir
cus, won by a. couple of lengths. The
latter closed a 4\i to 1 chance. ; V -/\u25a0
No doubt the story is as old as the
hills, but it still 'goes. Bob Ragon,
the 9 to 5 favoi-ite, should have won
the mile selling number,; but he didn't.
Fountain, who rode :him,' got jammed
in between -Cloudlight*' and Gloomy
Gus in the run home and -in a rattling
drive the former filly, earned a head
decision over the favorite. . There was
10 to :1 in profusion , about- the win
ner at one stage of the speculating. ,:
High weight selling races should be
cut out in future if all are to be like
the travesty, sixth to-be run. In .a
drive at the end Otis, astride Revolt,
defeated Toto Gratiot by a neck.
Sceptre, a 50 to 1 shot, took the show.
Collector Jessup, at. odds of 6 to 5,
made a gallop of the final seven-fur r
long event. Mildred Schultz, the,sec
ond choice, disposed of Judge Denton
for the place. . _ .;....'' \u25a0' ' '

- Both*3ritt and White have had their
la%t bouts with the gloves until they
don the five-ounce affairs in which
their hands will be encased on Friday
riifcht in Woodward's Pavilion. They
'have trained without the slightest set
' back, Britt especially workinjc \ Into
condition in a manner which pleases
hla friends greatly.
'It "is no secret that he is hitting
Harder than at any time in his rinr
career, and that he will try to win
with a knockout If he can. White's
form has .been kept so well under cover
that it Is a problem whether he will
prove the Jeffries of the lightweight
division or the Rlckards. 1
The men will come in at the weight
naturally, as the notch suits each of
them. Frank Rafael, who has had to
withstand -Britt's punches, is wearing a
decorated eye. He received this in a
'collision while boxing. Britt has fig
ured out a campaign which he expects
will land him a winner over his op
ponent. \u25a0 * . â¢
- White's long siege of 'training is
drawing to a close, the last hard work
being indulged- in yesterday. He will
now do only enough work to keep lim
ber and to keep off the surplus flesh.
The weight problem, however, cuts no
figure, as- the Briton *has hovered
around the 133-pound mark ever since
he began training.
He took a ten-mile spin to Fairfax
and return yesterday morning, regard
less of thte muddy condition of the
roada* He was accompanied by
j Charlie Mitchell, and Jimmy Lawlor.
In the afternoon he worked lor about
an hour in the gymnasium. The work
consisted of bag punching, weight
â¢pulling, wrestling, throwing the medi
cine balL and' four rounds of boxing
with Â£.awlor. He seems In the best of
condition.
Eddie. Hanlon and Young Corbett
affixed their signatures to articles of

APPROXIMATIONS.
The Occidental and Oriental Steam
ship Company's liner Coptic, Captain
"William Finch, which arrived Mon
day night from the Orient, passed
* quarantine inspection yesterday with
comparatively little delay and 'was
alongside the. Pacific Mail wharf
shortly after 9 o'clock. At Honolulu
it was discovered that a "Japanese
steerage passenger was suffering from
a mild- form of varioloid. All the pas
sengers on the liner as well as officers
" and crew were vaccinated and the
steerage passengers who had associat
ed with the sick man were taken
, -ashore and fumigated. The liner was
fumigated and when this had been
done the vessel u-as reVeased and the
cabin passengers were allowed to land.
During the voyage from Honolulu
Surgeon Gates kept a keen lookout
for any sign of further sickness. The
â¢ Federal . doctors at this port gave
; every passenger a rigid examination.
The steerage passengers were trans
furred to the steamer Caroline and
â¢taken to Angel Island, where they will
;be held for about a week. The Coptic
; was then released, but after she
reached the wharf her Oriental crew
uaÂ« taken to Angel Island for further
fumigation. They will be released to
day, but will .be kept under observa
.tipn on the Coptic during the liner's
\u25a0{\u25a0taj- in. orirt.
â¢ The Coptic encountered the rain
which washed the city streets on Mon-
t cay about fifty miles west of the Far
allones. after bucking head winds for
two days. BetXveen two heavy show
ers a pair of enormous waterspouts
were seen, whirling before the wind
ftiore .than half a mile away. Every
, l>ody rushed on deck to view the
" liquid pillars, but it was a short show.
lor within a very few minutes after
They were first seen a heavy curtain of
rain masked th.em from view.
The Coptic brought sixty cabin pas
sengers, sixteen in the steeraee and
*ighty-t\v o Asiatics, of whom only sir
were Japanese. Among the passen
pers were' many tourists, some of
Them from this city. The local people
included Mr. and Mrs. Stanley Dollar,
Mr. and Mrs. S. B. McNear and L. T.
Blandlng.
' Captain A. Wolkammer of the
â¢ Dutch steamer Wilhelmina, which was
captured by the Japanese outside of
Vladivostok, was a passenger on the
Coptic. The Wilhelmina's crew passed
through here sonte weeks ago.
Another passenger was H. E. M.
Wollheim, who* has been in Peking as
charge d'affaires of the Mexican lega
â¢ tion. Captain Zeeder. master of the
freighter Aztec, was also on the Cop
tic. There being no other officer avail
able. Captain Zeeder will take the
Korea, which sails to-day for the Ori
ent, temporarily relieving Captain !
Seabury. .who is on leave of absence.
When going into Yokohama the
Coptic passed twelve of the foreign
runners captured by the
. Japanese. The Hongkong Marii and
the Nippon Maru, two of the Toyo
Kisen Kaisha liners which used to run
'between here and the Orient, have
figured largely in maintaining the
- watch â¢ outside of Vladivostok. The
; Hongkong is credited with seven cap
tures, the Nippon with five. One of
them started after the Dutch steamer
TVilhelmina. but the ponderous old
freighter was so slow and- looked so
easy that the Japanese saved coal and
"Sent a steam cutter to gather in the
-Dutchman. The Japanese estimate of
the .Wilbelmina's power of resistance
is still a Sore point with Captain Wol
kammer,-who \u25a0was a passenger on the
Coptic.

BLOCKING WAY
OF SANTA FE
REAL ESTATE^TRANSACTIONS.
LONDON. Jiay 2.â The House of
Commons reassembled to-day after the
Easter . recess. The debate on the
aliens ' bill was commenced â¢by Sir,
Charles Dllke (advanced radical), who
opposed the measure, .'contending: , that
it was unnecessary.
Charles P. Trevelyan \u25a0â (Liberal), ta
seconding Sir Charles Dilke's motion
providing: for the rejection of the aliens
bill, 1 -referred Up the "universal sympa
thy .with the oppressed, misgoverned
Russian â¢ people', who are fleeinjr f from
their country, to escape conscription
for^ the (Universally detested war in
Manchuria." These, he said, would
be excluded from this country or find
greater difficulty in reaching America
if â the bill were passed.
Home Secretary Akers-Dougrlas said
the bill only aimed to exclude unde
sirable aliens. He described the ex
cellent deterrent effect of the Ameri
can-exclusion law on thU class of im
migrants and disclaimed ' any anQ
semltic' tendency "on the part -of tfia
British Government. -One reaaop why
he .desired to see the question sCB%d
was^that he believed that If the exist
ing: state ; of affairs continued " ther*
would be a chance for anti-sernltlc agi
tation in Ignorant quarters. .
Joseph Chamberlain supported taÂ»
bill as being a measure tending to kÂ«Â«p
out, cheap' labor. He said the bill was
merely a ; step toward greater things.
The principal reason for its introduc
tion and support by the Ministerialists
was that it was an . effort to protect
worklngmen against the labor Â«f for
eigner*. It would be but a small step
between the bill for keeping out this
class of labor and the bllkwhicbuCham-,
berlain said he hoped to seÂ« introduced
shortly, to prevent the sroods these peo
ple made .from coming into competi
tion, with those made in. Great Britain-
There was no logic m saying these peo
ple might remain at home and pro
duce goods which Great Britain ad
mitted free of duty.
, Premier Balfour pointed out the>
moderation of the bill, which, he main
tained, did not Interfere with the right
of asylum, as it was understood by tfio
forefathers.- and expressly provided
that poverty alone should not exclude
aliens. He said the question of alien
Immigration was wholly s distinct ' from
the ' Jewish queetlon as it appeared on
the Continent. 'He agreed*<hat the
United States had shown a remarkable
power of absorbing men' of different "
nationalities and turning them all. by'
press of national alchemy, into Ameri
can citizens; buf the absorbing power
had limits. There , were two" modern
conditions calling for modern remedies:
F^rst. facility of transport and. sec- -
ond, the fact that foreign countries,
notably the United States, realized that
unrestricted immigration might become "
a national evil.
..It must be observed, the Premier con
tinued., how 'foreign' legislation, es
pecially that of the United States,, had
reacted upon Great Britain. Many
aliens" en route to the United States
who were not provided with through
tickets; had remained here, and many,
of .those ..who reached the United
States unfit had returned to this coun
try. Great Britain had become a sort
of sieve which let through the fit- to
America, but retained the unfit' Unless
something Is done Great Britain must
remain ' a sieve in which useless dregs
are left.
; Sir , Charles Dilke's amendment ,was
rejected. 211 to 25. and \u25a0 the bill passed
its second reading without division.

NEW YORK. May 2.^-The character of the
selling which nret the opening advance in
prices to-day carried a eufnci'ent warning that
the stocks which were taken yesterday morn-
Ing to check the demoralization in the. market
were beipg disposed of again. â¢ 'It eeemed quite
evident-Uiat the high opening had been helped
for the purpose of making a better ' market for
disposing of these stocks. This is strictly In
accordance with the normal course of the mar
ket movement after such an episode as Sat
urday's violent break with the supporting.tao
tics of Jlenday. The appearance of this clr.ss
of selling somewhat dampened the sp*cÂ«lati"vÂ»
enthusiasm. Induced by yesterday's consider
able Â«d vance In prices. Even'th* conspicuous
advance* In special stocks later in the day did
not serve entirely to restore confidence in the
stability of Ute market. 'Nevertheless quite a
long list of effective gains were . shown -as â¢ a
result of the day's business, â¢\u25a0 and amoner the
industrials especially the strong points , wtre
numerous and diversified. The conspicuous ad
vances late, in the day were the- result of a
stirring anew of the rumors of deals which
have almost dropped out of eight in the de
moralization of sentiment for the past week.
The revival of talk of the lease of the Louis
ville and Nashville to the Atlantic Coast Line
on a dividend guarantee was especially effec
tive. . . - . - ;
The action of- the Chicago and Northwest
crn directors towards a 15 per cent btock in
crease eet afloat again various rumors regard
ing the railroad adjustment â¢ to be worked cut
ln'the Northwest. That stock itself had an im
mediate influence on the Vanderbilt group be
6lde. No detailed Information was given as
to the ends proposed with the proceeds of the
new issue, but *peeulativÂ« eentlmeut indulged'
in free conjecture along the lines that suited
best the prevailing mood. The .rew stock, is
part of an increase authorized by the stock
holders fully three years ago to be issued from
time to time in the discretion of the directors.
Plenty of rumors were current also of the dis
tribution of Northern Securities assets in a
manner to adjust all differences in that terri
tory.
Clearing house exchange rose to figures
near the record . level and this had some â¢ in
fluence on the supposition that some larje
transaction in financial afalrs was In courso
of comptetion. The Lead and Smelting merger
talk >ad some revival in. the natural course of
thine*. Consolidated Gas suffered' from the
threatened opposing legislation at Albany and
other New York public utilities, were sotne
â¢what affected in . sympathy. '. The weakness at
this point bad some influence in aggravating
the early reaction. Its influence rawd away
with the. latter . developments," but was re
newed at tbelast. .â¢ .. ....
The weekly crop summary was regarded as^
satisfactory in its showing for thÂ« winter
wheat crop. . March net earnings of railroads
made a further favorable exhibit, especially
that for the Pennsylvania system. .. The soft
ness of the market. when it was ought to thke
profits on the day's rlÂ»s indicated its limita
tions and the Irregular closing . show;] the
day's chances mixed and the extreme gains
much , reduced.

Homer Lea Â» and what he calls the

ceived a "caHlng down" from General
Funstbn. The call down was occa
sioned by the fact that Mr. Wong,
a Chinese . instructor in the academy,
paid, a visit to- the commander of the
department wearing "a uniform identi
cal with that worn by the United
States regulars. Wong was the bear
er^of. an . invitation. from Lea request
ing. General Funston to dlne~~ with him.

Wong dressed in the uniform of a lieu-"
tenant, of the United States,- army.
He flatly and hotly declined the dinner
invitation. ,/ He tried to ascertain .by!
what authority Wong: had donned a
copy / of Sam's uniform, but
Wong could only say that It ...was th,e
regular, uniform worn , by the academy.

' .James W: -Ward on "Medical Inspec

, general treatment of the child by par
entfe, by tebchers and by physicians.
Too 'often, said the doctor, physicians'
; efforts are sought 100 late.. for. any
* benefit to'the thus making their:
* rork one, oL diagnosis,, palliation and
* f prognosis, when it might have been
r prophylactic, curative and educational.
â¢ Dr. Ward said in a far-reaching way
* school inspection embraced the better
. *ment of the masses, both in its hygienic
and. economic aspect. The* census of
1900 tabulated 16,000.000 school children
â¢/in" the United States, and It had been
'â¢estimated .that 10,000,000 of these were

. He held that the improving of either
physical defects or- social surroundings
In adult life was a problem of almost
* hopeless perplexity,' while if these im
. pediments to racial prosperity be at
tacked in the budding periods of hu
man the difflculties were im
sieasurably, mitigated.
* It' was," his opinion that since the
,*. State has, made school attendance com
' pufsor>'' Jt sheuld be the duty to ap
point'school "inspectors for all schools,
both public and private, in all towns
â¢â¢ and villages.
\u25a0" Dr. Ward gave an account of medical
6Qhooi Inspection in this city by the
volunieer system, which, however, was
. not \u25a0 altogether satisfactory to the
Health Commission, owing to the diffi
culty under such' a system to cover
"all the schools.
He trusted soon to see a limited num
ber of paid inspectors who would be
able to devote their whole time tv the
t jcork. . : .
Speaking on the development of the
