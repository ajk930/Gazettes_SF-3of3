TOKIO, June 16, 7 p. m. â Barring the distance and consequent delays the Japanese are
entirely satisfied with the selection of Washington as the place for the peace conference..
It was hoped that some point in Northern China would be chosen in order to permit of
a speedy meeting of the plenipotentiaries and an early determination of the question of
peace or a continuance of J hostilities, but the acceptance of. Washington is cordial.

ASSISTANT SECRETARY
OF INTERIOR RESIGNS
With Marquis Ito, it is believed, will
come one of the other great statesmen
of Japan who has had. wide diplomatic
experience, and- Mr. Takahlra, the Jap
anese Minister, it Is suggested here,
may be named as the third plenipoten
tiary. Another important detail which
has been the subject of informal con
versations at the White House.- is the
language to be used at the conference
Russia will ask that the French lan
guage be used;, Japan will express \u25a0 a
preference for English, and In recog
nition of the courtesies, to -lÂ»c'' extended
the Olenlpotentlaries- by the Washing-
Exchanges on this point are now in
progress between Toklo and St. Peters
burg via Washington, but no final con
clusion has been reached. It was first
thought a preliminary protocol might
be elgned in Washington providing for
a temporary cessation of hostilities,
but in view of the fact that this con
cerns directly the armies In the field
It Is believed that the belligerents will
agree that arrangement of the armis
tice would be best intrusted to Llne
vltch and Oyama, the respective com
manders-in-chlef, who in such event
would be telegraphed special powers to
sign. The time limit for the armistice
has not been fixed, but it will be com
paratively brief, that , the progress of
the conference may be assisted as much
as possible.
Prior to the signing of the armistice,
however, will come the official . an
nouncement of the Russian and Japan
ese plenipotentiaries. Russia has in
dicated that her mission will be headed
by M. Kelidoft, the Russian EmbasstL
<3or to Paris, and it is understood that
the Emperor has required Marquis Ito
to head the Japanese mission, although
the distinguished President of tho
Privy Council, so far as known here,
has not yet accepted. Only his health
would cause him to decline, in which
event Field Marshal ' Yamagata proba
bly will be selected In his place.
Neither country has suggested the
names of tn Â« other plenipotentiaries,
nor has the number finally been agreed
upon, though ,the belief to-night is that
there will be three on a side.
WASHINGTON. June 16. â Alone on
the plains of Manchuria, midway be
tween the two great armies, the Rus
sian and Japanese commanders will
meet to sign the armistice which will
pave the way for the Washington con
ference If the present tentative pro

'Extravagant /expenditures are. to be cut

; In'a letter -addressed to CharlÂ«s H.

"Salaries should Ibe commensurate

. "The existence of any method, stand

"A'resolute effort should be made to

that the entire work of the Government

WASHINGTON, June 16.â Young blood
has been called upon by the President to
reform the business methods of the va
rious departments ; of " the Government. A
committee of investigation which -; has
been quietly at work for some time has
been appointed by the President to bring
about uniform methods In the business
among the -bureaus, with a view to sav

believed to amount to several millions

an- apparent indiscretion in some of hia
business dealings in Venezuela, there was
a likelihood that Loomi3~. might be ad
monished, but there is now every reason
to 'believe that the President's confidence
In Loomis is unshaken.
WASHINGTON. June IS.-Secretary
Taft is determined to close to-morrow his
investigation of the charges made against
the official integrity of Francis B. Loom
is. Assistant Secretary of State, by Her
bert XV. Bowen. American Minister to
Venezuela. It is known that Taft has not
been convinced of any dishonesty .on
Loomls" part, and there Is no indication
that the witnesses to be examined to
morrow will be unfavorable to Loom is.
With the case in its present aspect it is
as good as closed.
Loomis will be cleared of the charges
of dishonesty, while Bowen. who has dis
pleased the President by 'the manner in
which he made and gave publicity to the
charges, will be either dismissed from the
service or his resignation requested.
There is no reflection on Bowen's integ-
Loomis probably will be promoted to a

most conciliatory attitude toward - Ger
many, but every .concession -he makes in
spire^ fresh ; demand*, until: now Emperor
"William asks in effect the; cancellation of
the.- Anglo-French * entente. This' ls, 'of
course.; not demanded in v so many. words,
but it Is Insisted; that France shall make
rib combinations .antagonistic to German'
Interests. Complete submission to all the
pressure the Kaiser is now putting upon
the French republic : would reduce that
country . to vassalage.
France sincerely desires to avoid war.
but the moment it Is apparent that Ger
many is : deliberately attempting to hu
miliate her. French pride will burst into
uncontrollable resentment.
The British Government Is fully aware
that Germany's aggression is aimed quite
as much at Great Britain as against
Franc*. Lord Lansdowne is all for
peace, but the rest of the Cabinet Is \ de
termined |to resist with all the resources
of the : empire any , serious encroachment
on British interests.
PARIS., June 16.â The strained relations
between France and Germany over Mo
rocco continue to give rise to serious
apprehensions, but while openly admit
ting that there a.re real difficulties in
volved the officials protest : against this
being made the basis of exaggerated re
ports. Such reports have j been circulated
for several days past by a small section
of the press, notably by the Patrle and
the Presse. One report that Germany
had submitted an ultimatum brought out
a formal denial from the Foreign Office.
Another report in the Patrie is. that
Germany has demanded that France and
Great Britain complete, a guarantee that
the Anglo-French entente is not . In ' the
nature; of an armed alliance against Ger
many. The Presse asserts that M. Del
casse when Foreign Minister signed' a
secret offensive and defensive alliance
with Great Britain.
The3e reports are dismissed ; in authori
tative quarters as fanciful enlargements
at . the situation, and an editorial In * tha
semi-official Temps â¢ to-night gives r warn
ing against . what It . terms "nervous
paroxysm."
One of the chief causes of the present
apprehension is the possibility of some
untoward Incident ' along the ' Franco-
German border, which for years has been
garrisoned \u25a0 by. formidable military forces.
A generally pessimistic view. of the fu
ture Is [ taken \by - those in ' touch with ', tho
Foreign ' Office. ... .; _"'_ ...
At the same time the diplomatic strain
between . Franco and . Germany * is - unde
niably serious. Â» Tho chief cause - of .- this
is the inability thus far of each party to
propose a remedy acceptable to the other.
France Is ' tenacious to uphold her . pre
dominant position yin -Morocco r without
subjecting it to . Inspection .and" revision
by the international congress proposed by
Germany. \{On ? the .other hand.* Germany
does : not recognize French predominance
in Morocco or the existence , of I an ! agree

HONOLULU, June 16.â The split in the
local Republican party has resulted in
an exceedingly bitter and sensational
personal campaign .for Sheriff. The
election will take place on Tuesday.
Governor Carter has published a lor^:
Fig Tied statement, in which he opposes
Brown, the regular Republican nomi
nee. He says that Brown's former ad-,
ministration showed him to be weak,
lawless and corrupt. He predicts that
the town will be run wide open in the
event of Brown's election. Brown an
swered Governor Carter by publishing
a reply, denouncing the Governor's In
terference and denying, the charges he
made. The Republican Central Com
mittee waited on Governor Carter yes
-lerday and asked for an explanation of
his attitude. Governor Carter declared
that he was in favor of the electlon^of
High Sheriff Henry, the Incumbent and
candidate of the Civic Federation
League.
The Republican committee to-day
unanimously adopted resolutions de
claring that the Governor's reasons, for
opposing Brown were vague, indefinite,
unsatisfactory and Insufficient for a
break from the regular party nominee.
It is generally predicted that the
Republican factional fight will result
in the success of the home rule candi

Epec'.al Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, June 16.â T0-day's session
of the executive committee of the Equita
ble Life Assurance Society was devoted
to routine business. At the conclusion
Chairman Morton said that until the
Hendricks report is given out the action
of- the committee will be conservative. It
is now expected that the report will not
be made public before next Monday or
Tuesday.
The committee of policy-holders, of
which John D. Orimmins is chairman and
which was organized to secure the mu
tuslization of the Equitable Society, to
day adopted a resolution declaring It to
be the opinion of that committee that the
"voting trust" will assure an honest ad
ministration of the society's affairs. The
resolution was signed by John D. Crim
rnins, John B. Stanchtield, E. W. Bloom-
Ingdale. E. H. Oterbridge. Charles Bulk
ley Hubbell. Edwin Warfleld. Henry
Morgenthau and E. J. Esselstyn. the last
named as secretary.
Alexander S. Bacon, counsel for Roland
\u25a0\V. Dufort and other policy-holders, to
day made an attack on the recent trans
fer of the majority of the Equitable stock
by James H. Hyde to Thomas F. Ryan.
"I am not sure that there has been any
bona fide sale of tne Hyde stock," said
Bacon. "The fact of -ie price that is said
to have been paid has been . published Is
no prima facie evidence of such sale. I
believe that the policy-holders will short
ly find that they have been thrown from
the frying pan Into the flre. If this is
really a sale dummy truEtees would be
obliged to vote for dummy directors. The
twenty-eight directors to represent the
policy-holders will be really selected by
the management or their agents, who will
cease to be agents very quicky. if they
don't influence the policy-holders to se
lect the right directors."

adjourned for recess to-day at the trial
of Joseph Byrnes, a stableman of Clar
ence H. Mackay at Harbor Hill,, accused
of the murder of Alexander Kulkuski,
a Polish laborer at Roslyri, the widow of
KuJkuski, r who had been sitting quietly
in the rear of the courtroom, sprang for
ward at Byrnes, endeavoring to , strike
him with one hand, while her other arm
tightly held her Infant. She shrieked out
in broken English: "I'll have my revenge,
,as you killed my husband â¢ and now you
must take. care of my poor child."
The court policeman and Sheriff Gil
dersleeve attempted to push the woman
aside, but she kept running after the
prisoner, shrieking for revenge. -The
courtroom was In an . uproar and Judge
Keogh had the woman | taken away.
The widow, who understood but little
Engllsh t thought tne prisoner had been
acquitted and . when told he was being
taken back to his cell again became
quiet and made no further disturbance.'.

From a dozen to forty indictments
were to-day generally expected as a
result of inquiries which have lasted
since March and which brought in
scores of witnesses and occupied the
District Attorney's office for three
months. The charges are conspiracy,
violation of the anti-trust laws, per
jury, subornation of perjury and In
timidation of witnesses. The accused
made charges of their own, asserting
homes have been robbed by secret ser
vice men searching- for evidence.
There has also developed a serious
conflict among the packers themselves.
The Government officials are said to
count on producing testimony not ob
tainable except by some one turning
State's evidence.
CHICAGO, June 16.â Proposed indict
ments of officials of at least five pack-
Ing firms were said to have been pre
sented to members of the Federal
Grand Jury to-day by District Attorney
Morrison for consideration. A report
was currr-nt that the indictments had
practically been voted by the Jury.,

terday.
It is unofficially declared that the
Grand Jury to-day devoted much of Its
time to listening to the statements of wit
nesses, who declared that the strike
against Montgomery Ward & Co. was
Instigated by rival business houses.
State's Attorney Healy said to-night
that the investigation has assumed a
scope co extensive that the full session
of the present Grand Jury, which is to
continue for two weeks, will probably be
finished before the inquiry is concluded
and that a. special Grand Jury will be
necessary for the routine cases now
pending.
The strike situation to-day was almost
normal. But for the signt of policemen
and Deputy Sheriffs riding on delivery
wagons there would have been no 'evi
dence that a strike was In progress. The
business houses and express companies
had almost a normal stage in their deliv
eries. There is no present prospect of
peace.
CHICAGO, June 16.â Although rumors
of sensational developments in connec

tle tangible evidence to support them.
Assistant State's Attorney Fake declared
to-day that the evidence or Bribery given
before the Grand Jury was of a startling
character and that it could only be

ALAMEDA. June 16. â Gustnve A.
Wiese. known the world over for his
skill as an electrician and christened
"the Great White Light" by the people
of China after his installation of an
electric lighting system at Canton in
1599-1900. was In all probability the
man who committed suicide by shoot
ing himself and then toppling over
board from the ferry steamer Newark
Wednesday night while the vessel was
on her way to San Francisco. No one
witnessed the tragedy,- bu,t the report
of the weapon was heard and a re
volver was found on the deck by the
deckhands shortly after. This revolver
was positively identified as the property
of Wiese by Police Sergeant Albert
Kamp of this city to-day. He caw the
pistol in the property clerk's room of
the San Francisco Police Department
and he at once stated that he was posi
tive that it had belonged tor theuniss
ing electrician. V'
Wiese was seen here Wednesday
afternoon by W. R. McStay and on the
evening: of the same day by D. \V/Mar
tin. He appeared lo be despondent,
and Martin, Judging from Wiese's ac
tions, says he was under the influence
of liquor, and Martin remarked to him:
"Gus, I thought you were going to cut
out drinking:." Wiese replied: "Well, I
guess I can take a drink when I feel
like it." N
Wiese was for nearly ten yÂ»ars su
perintendent of the city's electric light
and power plant. His wife dioÂ«l eight
een months ago after a long 1 illness and
her passing; away broke his Bpirit and
left him subject to melancholic moods.
Six months ago Wiese was removed as
head of the municipal electric depart
ment by the City Trustees because of
his physical condition, which unfitted
him for the responsibilities of the po
sition.* Wiese took his dismissal much
to heart and brooded over it constantly.
Of late he had been employed "as" an
electrician by the Bay Counties Power
Company. Wiese was affiliated with
Oak Grove Lodge, Free and Accepted
Masons, of this city, and his two sons,
Alva and Ernest, are inmates of the
Masonic Home at Decoto. With regard
to the identification of the: pistol :found
upon the -deck of the Newark, Sergeant
Kamp said: *
"I know the revolver well. It be
longed to Wiese and was In my pos
session for some time while Wiese was
a patient in an Oakland sanitarium.
Wiese had spoken frequently of taking
his life and it is my belief that he has
done away with himself. He was de
spondent because of the death of his
wife, the loss of his city Job and the
lack of work."

While Reed already had been married
once, the new Mrs. Reed has also had a
previous marital experience. She first
married George Cook, an Eastern book
maker, who came to this coast for one
season several years ago and lost $80,000,
and took such a dislike to the winter rac
ing that he has never been back to Cali
fornia. After,.,belng separated from him
6he was marrted to William Orear, who
had the concessions for the news stands
in the ferry, building. She got a divorce
from him a few- weeks after they, were
married. .
Reed arrived here from Guatemala day
before yesterday, and before he was able
to leave the Pacific Mall dock he was
served with the copy of a complaint in
an action brought by his former wife for
$1000, which she claims he owes her. He
refused to talk ' about the suit to-day,
and, in fact, had little or nothing to say
In regard to his affairs. Mrs. Reed did
say, however, that they would stay in
Berkeley for some . time before she and
her husband ' returned to. their southern
home.
Whatever the grounds were that caused
her to make her complaint and charge
him with being a bigamist, they were not
sufficient to cause the holding up of the
final decree, a copy of which Reed had
with him to-day and which he exhibited
to Justice of the Peace Quinn as proot
positive that he was legally entitled to be
married.
OAKLAND, June 16.â The veil shroud-
Ing the mystery of the marital affairs of
George W. Reed, the â¢ wealthy Guate
malan planter, who has been charged
with bigamy by a former wife, was part
ly raised to-day, when he secured a li
cense and was married to Mrs. Louise
Reddan Cook-Orear of Berkeley. There
was little ceremony In the affair to-day
more than the actual requirements of the
law, and the nuptial knot was tied by
Justice of the Peace Quinn in his court
room at Eighth street and Broadway.
The bridal party consisted of Reed, the
bride, her mother, Mrs. Reddan of 1940
Haste street, Berkeley, and her brother.
Gus Reddan, a San Francisco cigar man.
They appeared at the County Clerk's of
fice about 2:30 o'clock this afternoon, and
after securing the marriage license were
driven to Quinn's courtroom, where the
marriage was quickly pronounced and
oveV with. The four again entered their
carriage and went to the Reddan home in
Berkeley.
At the marriage license window Reed
gave his age as 4$ years and that of his
bride as 28. He has spent many years in
Central America, where he has large cof
fee plantations, and is reputed to be a
millionaire, and the tan of the tropical
sun has made him brown as a berry.
Mrs. Reed Is reported to have come
from a Central American port several
weeks ago ion the City of Sydney. ' She
then gave her name as Mrs. George Reed
and went Immediately to the home ot
her mother at Berkeley. It was presum
ably this assumption of Reed's name that
caused Mrs. Nellie B. Reed, who is living
at the St. Francis Hotel In San Francisco,
to protest against the granting of a final
decree of divorce to Reed by Judge
Troutt on the sth of this month.

RENO. June 16.â J. Henry, a man near
ly 60 years of age, was found In the foot
hills near this city to-day in a dying con
dition. His head was pillowed on a sage
brush when he was found and he was
scantily attired- After being cared for
he was able to make a snort statement
in which he told of the cruel treatment
hÂ«? had suffered at the hands of the
County Commissioners. He said that he
had asked the county officials for per
mission to enter the County Hospital and
had been refused. He wandered Into the
hills and could remember no more. He is
now being cared for by the city author
ities and may live.

It is thought that the building of stor
age reservoirs ; In the" upper end of the
valley under the Irrigation act will have
effect in. reducing the flow, of- the river in
flood times and thus materially assist. in
the river project : to'; protect the lower
reaches of the Sacramento from overflow.
Senator Newlands said thaty it was a
unique condition that people in the upper
portion of the valley should need water
and that there should be too much ( water
at times in the lower portion. ,The Cali
fornia 1 Promotion 1 Committee has provided
the visiting delegations with bulletins ou
the Sacramento River project.
SACRAMENTO, June 16.â The members
of the joint Senate and House Committee
on Irrigation are much interested in the
project to Improve the navigability of the
Sacramento River, protect adjoining lands
from floods and reclaim 1,000,000 acres of
swamp lands. They were given a demon
stration of the river country this after
noon in a three 'hours' journey; from
Knights Landing to Sacramento by cour
tesy of the Sacramento Transportation
Company. ' Â«' .
Although the river improvement and
swamp land reclamation project is entire
ly distinct from the projected work under
the national reclamation act, and ' each
work will be ' undertaken_by a different
department of the Federal Government,'
yet it is the opinion of Chief Engineer J.
B. LJpplncott of the Reclamation ' Service
on the coast that both works should be
undertaken with ' reference to \u25a0 their mu
tual effect upon each other.- ;

The race was sailed last year on an
ebb tide, which shortens the time during
which the boats are'engaged in wind
ward work. The San Francisco yachts
men tried to get a flood tide race this
year, last year's contest having taken
place almost wholly on an ebb tide. It
is high water at Fort Point at 12:40
p. m. to-day, "the tide running out un
til S:OS p. m.. so that, to-day's race will
also be on an ebb tide, thus lengthening
the time during which the boats will
run and shorten the time during which
they will beat. The admirers of the
Challenger base their hopes on a stiff
breese and superiority in windward
work, it being admitted that a shal
low, flat-floored boat like the* Corin
thian, with her centerboard up. can
run faster than a fln-keel boat, whose
keel is fixed and cannot be ralsod.
The committee in charge of the task
of preparing the Corinthian for the race
(ex-Commodores A. J. YotmgV J. W.
Pew and H. D. Hawks) has made some
changes in the Corinthian and the mem
bers believe she is faster than she was
last year.
Her measurement has also been re
duced somewhat, so that she will cede
a smaller time allowance to the Chal
lenger than last year. , In the hope of
making her keep more headway while
going about,. the committee had a heavy
iron shoe put on the Corinthian, but
this appearing to be a drawback .in
some respects was removed. .The sup
porters of the Corinthian are hoping
for a good stiff breeze, /believing the
Challenger to be fast . in \u25a0'- light airs.
They do not want a gale, in which the
frreaj. stability of the Challenger would
be an advantage. Frank " Stone, the
skipper of the Corinthian, expresses him
self as satisfied with the present be
havior of the boat in a heavy.sea. ;..;
The steamer H. J. Corcoran,, which has
been chartered to carry spectator*, will
be at Powell-street wharf at 12:30 p.im.,
and will follow the. racing yachts around
the course. The judges, timers and other
officials will have a launch of their: own,
as they must be at'the" wnarf :in 'order
to make their rexÂ»rdÃ. " The race will;; be
under the management of Roy C. Ward,
Henry G. Toll and I* P. Risford,;the
regatta committee of the San Francisco
Yacht Club and of.T. J. 5 Kavanagh, Stew
art Mlddlemas and A. , J. . Young , of ' the

The wind on that day was of only
moderate strength and many of the
members of the San Francisco Yacht
Club believed that in a heavy wind
their representative would have won.
On the second beat to the Presidio
Shoal buoy the Challenger gained
forty-six seconds on her rival. â¢'Â»;.->> ;V-
The most iiaportant as well as the
most widely interesting- yachting event
of the year will tal:e place to-flay on
the bay â the race for the San Francisco
Perpetual Challenge Cup. This trophy
is held by the Corinthian Yacht Club,
which won it last year on July 9, when
the centerboard sloop Corinthian beat
the fin-keel sloop Challenger by the
narrow margin of forty-one neconds,
corrected time.

> -The comins- tournament, like that for

.True,; there are many promising young

ers: like Gardner, Janes. ' Long, Griffin,
Foley and Adams , will all " develop into
flrst-cass men, but at present the cham
pionship class is almost- a myth. Murdock
has played tennis- that entitles ; him* to
rank in this class, but his defeat at the
hands of Gardner, shows his play is not
always up to the standard. " .
For the first time in the history of ten
nis'on the coast the preliminary rounds
of a big championship tournament will
consist of two out <of three set matches.
This change is a welcome one and will do
much ' for the game. â¢ In the past players
have suffered greatly from having to play
two | five-set matches a day In the heat
that prevails at San Rafael In* July. This
has always played . havoc j with the form
of the contestants,. and in many instances
the cleverest player has not carried off
the honors. In these matches stamina
has counted for fully as much as skill,
but in future the best player should win.
Many a player has gone into his second
match tired out - and in no condition to
play a hard game. With the matches two
sets out of three the players should be* at
all times in condition to play their best
games. 'JgJÂ¥Â§gSpS3BS -

' At the Fourth of July regatta on

ing in a four-oared shell race between
crews of the Ariel flowing- Club and
the' Vallejo Yachting and TRowing Club.
The start will be from the Piedmont
Baths and the finish, near the Twelfth
street bridge, the distance 'being about,
a mile straightaway., These crews. met
in the regatta held at Vallejo on Deco
ration day and each, feels confident it
can beat the other. The Vallejo oars
men say their crew was: leading by
three-fourths of a length -when No. 3
broke his. oar. In consequence of this
mishap the Ariel 3 gained a lons lead,
but swamped, so the.Vallejoa crossed
the finishing line ahead.
A regatta will be b eld. on Sunday.
July 50, at El Campo. Arrangements
have been made with the lessees and
managers of that resort to hold eight
or nine rowing races. Special steamers
will convey spectators to El Campo at
9:30 and 11:30 a. m. and at 1 p. m.; re

i The racing barges used In competi-*
tlon on San Francisco bay are so light
and frail that they are good for scarce
ly more than two or three regattas,
being' incapable of standing- the strain.
After each regatta the braces must be
tightened. The old racing barges do
not even make good practice boats. As
long as the races are held with a turn
there in a great premium on a boat
that goes round easily, . so that tho
competition is between boatbuilders,
rather than between crewvs. Oarsmen
are thinking: of adopting shell rowing,
and. If this Is done, straightaway races
must be held, as a shell. la unhandy on

It seems J. A. Richardson of Denver
has the best of the match he recently
made with G. A. Easterbrook. These
gentlemen each put up $250 forfeit a
few weeks ago for a match race to be
trotted at Denver on the 29th inst. be
tween Mr. Richardson's Strathway
gelding Getaway < 2:24 %) and Mr
Easterbrook's McKinney mare Delia
McCarthy (2:20%). The race Is to be
for 51000 a side. Delia McCarthy has
been starting on the N>w Mexico-Colo
rado circuit, and although she won a
couple of races and secured a mark of
2:20 she was beaten In slower time and
docs not look to have the class to win
CkUwar has worked miles in 2:16 dur
ing \he past week and Is said to- be
equal to 2:12 If pressed to his limit
This Is better than anything the mare
ever displayed while she -was In Cal

The burning of the grandstand at
Fresno last Saturday made things look
rather bad for the breeders' meeting
there in July, but before the embers
had cooled a comntlttee of Fresno
horsemen headed by Fulton G. Berry,
A. J. Hudson and George L. Warlow
had arranged to erect a new stand big
enough to accommodate 2000 people.
and the meeting will be held as first
advertised. Xo stalls were destroyed,
nor even eeorched. Entries for this
meeting closed on Thursday last, and
while full returns will not be in until
thÂ« first of next week. It Is expected
every race will fill.
At the California State Fair this year
there will be three rich stakes for

ST. LOUIS. June 16.â Four favorites won
at the Delmar track to-day, with ' two
well played second choices. The books
received a hard rub on the day. Elastic
galloped over his field in the feature.
The day was the last of bookmaklng in
the State of Missouri, the repeal' of the
breeders' law going into effect to-morrow.
Nevertheless, racing will continue at Del
mar, although the A. T. A. Track Union
will close down. President Denning, in
an Interview, states the racing associa
tion at Delmar will have nothing more to
do with betting. The bookmakers, how
ever, have organired the Central , Turf
Association, which will operate as -does
the Metropolitan Association in the East.
The new law makes the "recording of
bets," not betting itself, a felony. It Is.
believed the legal proceedings which will
follow arrests to-morrow will: result in
the law being declared unconstitutional.
In any case, it is expected racing will
continue here for several weeks, pending
the legal adjustment of the difficulty.

The company that ran with Voorhees
was first-class. They were Mr. KeenVs
Lancastrian, Richard T. Wilson Jr.'s
Nostomo, John E. Maddens Hammer
away, R. H. McCarter Potter's Belle
of PeQuest and T. L. Watt's Barberloot.
Voorhees was top weight in this bunch,
but he had run so well at Gravesend
In the best of company that the talent
went to him with avidity. Even money,
the price offered by the layers at the
opening of th c speculation, was
grabbed quickly, and In a little while
the highest obtainable was 8 to 10.
He finally closed a 3 to 5 chance. The
race was Vooriiees' all the way. The
winner was bred by A. B. Spreckels,
master of JCapa Stock Farm. He is by
the imported horse Solitaire 11.
Long before the finish of the second
race murmurs of dissatisfaction went
up all over the grounds when it be
came apparent that Pronta would win
without doubt and thus afford the most
glaring form reversal of the year.
On Wednesday/ the 14th met., at
Gravesend, this mare, weakly ridden
by J. Kelly, the same jockey who was
on her to-day, was just "inside the
money" in a race won by Wizard.
Kelly's weak effort attracted universal
attention. Those who saw her re
.markably good preliminary to-day an
ticipated a much better race on her
part, but were hot prepared for the
meteoric speed she displayed.
The closing event resulted in one of
the most stubbornly contested races of
the year, culminating in a thrilling fin
ish between Outcome, Wotan, Dande
lion and Xehailan. all only a few inches
apart. While the judges placed Out
come first, they could Just as easily
have declared Wotan the winner, and
none could safely contradict them.

Voorheea, & splendid bay colt, racing
in the color* of Senator Pat McCarren
of Brooklyn, broke the flve-furlona; rec
ord to-day for the grass course when
he won the Daisy stakes. The Daisy
was the two-year-old stake of the day."
It has been a special of the June meet
ing: at Sheepshead since 1890. That it
has always attracted good fields Is evi
denced by the fact that the names of
such shifty two-year-olds as Charade,
Harry Reed, King-dom, George Kessler,

on its winning: roster.

BCGVILLE FUN.
A NEW form of monopoly combination is disclosed by- the
I\ Grand Jury investigations in Chicago. The. coal team owners
r .*\u25a0 and the coal teamsters, it is charged, combined.- The union
teamsters agreedto work only for members of the coal team owners'
association, and the latter agreed to employ only union drivers.
This forced all coal team owners into that association and all coal
team drivers into that union. That was a monopoly, air and water
tight. The result was a raise in th"c price of hauling coal. It had
been uniform at 30 cents a ton. Â« It was raised to 50 cents and $I.'
The public was; fleeced. It was the shorn lamb and nothing
tempered the bleak wind for its benefit. Both, parties to the com
bination profited by the monopoly and through affiliations. and feder
ations were able to defy the public. The raise of from 60 to 200
per cent in the cost of delivering coal had to be borne under penalty
of getting no coal at all. If an independent team owner entered
the field to reduce the cost by competition, the only possible way
to, .do it, he was destroyed by the boycott anjd his drivers were
bludgeoned. No large consumer in Chicago dared "patronize him,
because such . consumer was immediately isolated. , He. was hot
permitted' to send out or receive merchandise, and : if he; \yere ai
manufacturer his products could be denied the right of transporta-t
tion and their sale pre veil ted â every where an 1 the country. *
Such; a combination is in restraint of trade. The local Grand 1
Jury may deal .with it under the law of HHnois, but the Federar
courts ; ha\*e a duty. - in . the . matter, ; unless there - is a clat^se in the!

Â» I O man can ever call himself _a practical pessimist until he begins systemat-
I\| lcally wearing his clothing and arranging his house so that the worst arid
* ' shabbiest side of everything can be seen. For optimism in this vale, of tears
means nothing more than making the best of things as they . areâ which is the
reason why we. always turn our best side to view. j :
It is curious sometimes to hear a man who. thinks himself wholly given over
to thoroughgoing pessimism drawing down the corner of his. mouth as he smiles'
at one of his demonstrations because there is a tooth missing just behind, or cov
ering a worn place on the arm of his chair with one hand while he uses the other
to drive, home his doctrine that everything is Justas bad as it can be.
Fortunately, for the world, .the people in it are accustomed to making. the best
of life, to putting the best side of everything, out, or mankind would not have
had the courage to survive. So far as can be Judged from the earliest records of
the race this has always been so/ and has always been coupled with the eager
desire. to. do no niore work than is needful.
Savages have a way. of making the outside of a bowl or jar no better than the
inside, and of carving Just as elaborately an angle out of sight on a weapon as
any of the rest; but the beginnings of what we call civilization put an end. to all
that. ' "- \u25a0 . '\u25a0 :' " \u25a0'\u25a0 \u25a0 - : '\u25a0 \u25a0 : *. \u25a0'â¢'\u25a0'

OUR people should be alive to the importance of our trade with i
China. That trade is not limited to our manufactures, but
calls for some of our leading food products. Ten years ago
Li Huns? Chang said that the ' population of China had nearly
reached equality with its food supply, and that the empire would
have to import' food to support its people. If that were true ten
rears ago the increasing export to China of dour and other foot,
products- is explained. That export must go on rising, for a people
no matter where they are nor what their economies, must. eat, and
the nations that produce a food surplus must be resorted to for the
primary means of existence.
China has long been, and still is, a large importer of cotton and
-woolen goods. Though American manufacturers have not properly
studied the grade or as .the Chinese say "the chop" of such goods
suited to that market as closely as they might, the settlement of
Chinese merchants in seaports "like San Francisco has resulted in
more earnest attempts to conform the merchandise to the needs
of the market, but the limitations imposed upon the coming of
Chinese merchants is already felt in our exports.
Amoy. just below the straits of Formosa, the leading seaport of
the rich province of Fookien. is one of the oldest treaty ports. It
has- been an open door to foreign trade for many years. As some
of our merchants and manufacturers know, it has a very enterpris
ing and intelligent class of Chinese merchants and brokers in mer
chandise. Its means of distribution to its hinterland are fairly good
and it has the interior trade of a region that has developed, in a
marked degree a need and a taste for foreign goods. Amoy imports
millions every year in clothing fabrics alone. These are cotton
sheetings, drill, 'jeans, cambrics, -lawns, muslins, printed cottons or
calicos, cotton flannels, velveteens, in straight cotton, and poncho
cloth and flannels in mixed goods, and very large supplies in whole
wool of blankets, rugs, tweeds and serges. An American merchant
and manufacturer, a cotton grower and sheep owner needs only to
glance at the list to understand what it means to the producer of
clothing fibers and to the industries which convert these into
Of cotton yarns alone Amoy took last year 7.771,700 pounds,
and the demand is constantly advancing. Cotton yarns are a favor
ite form of cotton export, and wherever a demand for yarns and
cotton fabrics can be stimulated it deserves our attention, because
our annual cotton crop is increasing beyond all expectations. When
it is remembered that our cotton growers last year discussed the
policy of leaving a large percentage of the crop unpicked, in order
to reduce the surplus, it must be evident that this great staple
needs a wider outlet. In I&J2 we grew 2,974,000 bales of cotton
and our own mills used 37 per cent of it. In 1902 the crop was
10.768,000 bales, and our own mills used 38 per cent of it. It is
easily the leading agricultural staple of fourteen of our States, and
it is" spreading into eight more as a desirable crop, in rotation
Since 1898 there has been a sharp decline in our cotton ex
ports, and this has become more marked in the last two years, as
far as our Asiatic trade is concerned. It is true that we supply the
jaw material to our manufacturing competitors, which they use to
take the trade we are losing in China, but that does not profit' the
producer nor the country nearly as much as would the manufacture !
of cotton here for export as fabrics. Asia is the great cotton using
grand division of the globe. It is used there more generally for
inner and outer garments than anywhere else in -the world. ; Its
production has never been domesticated in Asia to an appreciable
extent, and notwithstanding all the efforts made by England and
Germany to create other sources of supply, the United States re
mains, master of the cotton world. The port of Amoy is a fair index
of the cotton and woolen fabric trade in China, and we are being
distanced in that market by y our manufacturing rivals. The cause,
openly assigned, is our failure to treat fairly the rights of Chinese
merchants in the United States. An American merchant does not
expect trade at home by abusing his customers. If he make it his
business, or permit others to make it their business, to denounce and
abuse those who want to trade with him, they will not want to
trade with him any more, but will go, where they are treated as
human beings having human rights. It is very unfortunate that in
this country a large number of people look upon all Chinese as
coolies and use. them despitefully. To, explain it is necessary to
cite one case. A Chinese merchant, a man of financial standing,
desirous of stimulating trade between this country and China,
landed here properly certificated on May 2, 1904. He was practi
cally jailed while his right to land was under examination. His
confinement was compulsory.- He could neither land here nor go
back to China until his case was settled. The first stage of his
case took until June 23. The decision against him was transmitted
to the Department of Commerce, and there was finally reviewed,
decided. in his favor and the decision promulgated August. 1. This
merchant had been held a prisoner nearly four months before he
was permitted to land in a country whose trade with his own he
desired to increase. -A.;
That is only one of many such cases. Now if the policy to be
served by such treatment of merchants is of more importance ihan
our foreign trade with China, then that severe treatment should
continue, until no merchants come and those already here find their
efforts to export our goods to their country thwarted by our classi
fication of all Chinese as coolies. If, however, our share of the
vast commerce of China is of more importance than the satisfaction
of making prisoners of Chinese merchants, we â¢ should accord; to
them the simplest human rights and treat them at least as well as
we treat imported dumb brutes. *
OUR TRADE WITH CHINA.
THERE is a certain neighborhood that
is a center of conservatism. Nearly
all the residents 'have owned their
own homes there for a period of from
ten to thirty years, and are all in mod
erately comfortable circumstances; some
-of them are, in- fact, wealthy. -None of
them has ever had social aspirations.
They aro a quiet, exemplary set, and
they resent innovations .'with 'the Indig
nation of the Medes and the Persians;
They have only -now become accus
tomed to the apartment building that was
erected in their j
neighbornood some J
five years ago. i
There are a few of
the renters' of the
flats whose family
associations have i
brought' them the j
friendship of the
other . neighbors.
These â¢ few -'-. have
joined the old ele
ment and have
adopted the same
attitude toward "the
rairk outsider '.who
intrudes..
There was : cause,
however, for their
treatment of the
newest renter. This
family,, consisting
of the husband,
wife and three
year-old daughter,
moved in on the
first of. May. When
the neighbors, saw
the woman for the
first time they
gasped in horror.
She was standing
oh the .pavement,
superintending "the
men who were
bringing In ' the
brightly - v p h o l
atered furniture. ,
She was attired
in a long kimono
that was. of the
most j vivid green;
and . white flowered'
mixture. Her hair
was of the most
dazzling peroxided
tint. I Her voice
was loud and of a
grating quality.
Ker manners ' were
those of a fish
woman,.' and her
tone .would have
been tne delight
and the despair of
the huckster.
"Take them rugs
out in the j back
yard and give them
a beating," she
shouted to one of
the helpers. The
man \ ooeyed meek
ly. ; . "
ICext door a spot
less washing
flaunted Itself on
the. lines. The
laundress . had just
finished, her work
and.; was t surveying
with -'.pardonable
pride the s snowy
linens. As the first
cloud of dust' rose
and, settled upon
them â¢ she - i went
angrily to seek her
mistress. Mrs. Lor
imer came out to
settle the difficulty.
The blonde of the
( bright kimono j was
running down the
stairs, when she saw her. neighbor talk
ing to the man, who had now stopped
beating the rugs. She took in the sit
uation at a elar.ee.
"Keep right on," she told the man.
"Just beat them there rugs as much as
you want to." ->.
"But can you not' see,"- asked Mrs.
Lorimer. "that this is an Injustice?"
"You paying the rent of my flat?"
asked the blonde pertly.
The laundress rose to the occasion.
."There's a law , against beating rugs in
an inclosed space," she announced.
"We'll get the police." The rug beating
stopped. The conservatives, had scored
a victory. ' \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0â¢"\u25a0 -.*.'. - -
The lady of the peroxide locks was un
daunted. "That afternoon she "ran'over"
to the Wllloughby house to ."borrow. a
few things." Mrs. Willoughby was too
amazed to refuse the broom, the pie tins
and the gas heater to the stranger. The
next morning Mrs. Simmons^ was startled
to find the wearer of the green kimono at
her back door asking her to allow the
use of a half-dozen, cups. " .\u25a0
Two days later the lady of' the kimono,
now attired : in a wonderful creation of
violet cloth, began to pay calls ; in the
neighborhood. She called jon | every one
in the block. At : the end of a week she
repeated her calls. At every â¢ one â¢ of , the
houses the maids assured' her that", no
one was at home; \u25a0 Nothing daunted, she
came again. â¢: '
The conservative neighborhood ; held its
breath in fear and wonder, at this woman
who I upset every notion Bof I conventions
that they regulated; their' lives" with.
Clearly, .this : woman was a. most â¢ unde
sirable . neighbor. Â«"! Something ; must be
done to get , rid , of , her. ;i The Platts, I who
lived on the floor below : her "and who
were, the ,-worst: sufferers, from \ her - prox
imity, offered ; themselves ' as , the victims.'
One , morning last week, amid Tconsid
erable excitement, a carriage was rapidly
driven awajT* from in front of the ; apart
ment-bouse. The blonde was down stairs
in three seconds.. -'. '

Although the Taft party is supposed

footing and fell two stories to the ground be
low.: At. the Central Kmergency '. Hospital it!is
feared that he has sustained Internal Injuries.,
"To-morrow morning," ; said - Attorney
William Tomsky yesterday. "I will file
my -petition in the "Supreme Court ask
ing that Judge Coffey be prohibited from
annoying- me with satirical thrusts every
time I appear in his court. Not only will
I do' this, but I will ask that the court
summon Judge Coffey to appear and ex
plain what he meant when he said that
'every time he topk a lawyer to task. the
lawyer rushed to the Supreme Court, pre
sented things -in- his light and then in
turn he. Judge Coffey, was taken to task
by the Supreme Court." My petition will
be a hummer, but it goes to-morrow." -
Juage Coffey *Tests smilingly under
Tomtky's threat and It was not.difficult
for him to turn to the pages of , the case
of Tomsky against the Superior Court.
This was the case Tomsky carried to the
Supreme Court 'after Judge Coffey-, had
adjudged' him - guilty of contempt - of
court for refusing to return moneys rto
Dora Levy, executrix of \u25a0 the . will . of
Michael S. Levy. In a brief filed on, be
half of Judge .Coffey ln" v the Supreme
Court the statement; is made. that. Tom
sky secured $30 from, the executrix" of
the will to pay costs of the guardianship
proceedings affecting Marcus Levy, minor
child of the deceased;- "All TomTsky did,"
says the court in : the brief, "was to file
the petition for letters of guardianship,
ba\irg the \ fees for the same' remitted,
and then kept the ; $30 secured from the
executrix for the payment of the costs."
"And this." concludes the brief, "Tom
sky does not deny."
"Tdat's all ancient history." says .Tom
sky,-. "and there Is no. reason .whyÂ£ it
should be made the basla of a roast every
time I appear In Judge Coftey's court-;
room. And if the S Supreme^ Court; will
aid me I will see that this thing- comes to
a full. and final stop." " â¢ V

"Your statement is a deliberate false

ed Cannon warmly. "You. know it is a
lie!"?
"I repeat again _ that you represent
blackmailers!" shouted Heggerty.
"Order and proper bearing of counsel
must -be. maintained. In this court," said
Judge Graham; "arid I will see, that it is"
And he did, and nothing further was said
by counsel. . .
The case is one in which interest in sev

transferred by Smith to his widow, Marie

COUNSEL INDULGE
IN BITTER WORDS
Oma Huntsman has asked the court
to restrain her husÂ»>and, Charles H.
Huntsman, from disposing of his prop
erty pending the decision of her suit
for divorce.
James D. Davidson. Western expert for
the Corbin and the Yale lock companies,
with headquarters at 724ij Market street,
has found, that the! combination of wo
man's mind defies all of his skill and ex
perience. For twenty years he has dwelt
as the husband of Annie M. Davidson ana
now they have come to the parting of the
waye, Mrs. Davidson being the plaintiff
in a suit for divorce now on hearing be
fore Judge Hunt, this being the second
she has filed in a period of a month. Her
firet prayer of divorce on the ground of
cruelty was denied by Judge Hebbard,
but. nothing daunted, she has included a
few more charges of cruelty in a second
complaint and started anew. â¢ ' " .
Before Judge Hunt yesterday she ap
plied for alimony pending the outcome of
her suit. Davidson's counsel informed the
court that a similar application made to
Judge Hebbard a month ago was denied,
for it was proved that the wife was amply
provided with money and other property
to care for herself: "Furthermore," said
Davidson's counsel, "her complaint In this
suit is almost the same as the one in the
euit she lost, and Davidson should be
given the added advantage that goes with
his cross-complaint. Mrs. Davidson has
once* failed to prove her charges anoT'we
feel sut9 we can prove ours."
The court denied the application with
out prejudice. Davidson, in his cross
complaint, cays that one evening he re
turned from his place of business to his
home to find that his wife had done his
clothes up in a neat bundle and deposited
them on the front Eteps. When he asked
her tho meaning of it all she said was
she wanted neither him nor his clothesâ
that he could take his clothes and go.
This he did and then she filed suit for
divorce. Once he has defeated her, he
says, and can do it again. But he asks
that the court him from the woman
that wants no more of him and permit
him to go his way,, solving the riddles of
time locks and combinations, his mind
free of the one problem he has found be
yond himâ the problem of woman's mind.
Charles T. Chance, president and
manager of the Herbo. Chemical Com
pany, with offices in the Crossley build
ing, is the defendant in a suit for di
vorce filed yesterday by Belle B.-
Chance (nee Quareles). In her com
plaint Mrs. Chance alleges that her hus
band has LV;en most careless* of his af
fections and that he has- bestowed the
greater portion thereof on a Mrs. Cam
eron of Seattle and LHlle Lyons, who
dwells on Ellis street. In addition to a
decree of divorce Mrs. Chance asks for
suitable alimony.
Suits for divorce were also filed yes
terday by Margaret against George H.
Murray for desertion. Alice M. against
Marcell M. Smith for desertion, Edwin

3IENTAL CONDITION
Dr. J. L Stephen's system of earning
tils salary as chief emergency surgeon
does not meet with the approval of the
Board of Health. "; Thursday last Steph
en received a letter from- the Health
Board, instructing him to put in more
time at the. hospitals and to improve
his methods of governing the same In
stitutions.- The communication was in
peremptory words, and clearly showed
the attitude of the -majority of the
Health Board ; toward the man In
charge of the city's hospital service.
The number of hours that Stephen
shall be on duty- at the hospitals was
defined in the order.
Tuesday night Drs. Worth. Hughes
arid Harvey, members of the Health
Board, visited the Central Emergency
Hospital and made a thorough investi
gation. They inquired particularly .as
to the frequency, of the chief surgeon's
visits, in the light of his ready disap
pearance at crucial moments, and
seemed surprised when informed how
much time he spent at his post to earn
his salary of $175 a month. The Health
Board members thought Stephen's ac
tions insolent and the following day
called a meeting. With the exception ot
Dr. Simon,: "Stephen's right-hand man."
allpf the board voted for the framing
of the caustic communication that was
sent him. Part of the letter read:
VYou will without fall be at the hos
pital between 8 and 9 a. m., 11 and 13
a. m. and 4 and â¢ 5 p.m .," and endeavor
to govern your actions more in- keep-
Ing with the position wljich you are
holding." - - / .
The wrath of the- man who openly
boasts that "Ruef-will stand ..by him"
was great. His ".visits to the Central
Emergency Hospital wore a beaten
path In the hard pavement. Yesterday
he reinaugurated the register system,
which was started . with such dismal
failure some months ago after Ms first
"jacking up." In a book which .is
chained to the telephone Stephen enters
his arrival and . departure at. the hos
pital, and compels the surgeons to do
likewise. When the time served seems
unduly short he Inserts an explanatory
note, explaining his movements during
the time when he should have been on
duty. . â¢
The Health Board is said to be try-
Ing to oust Stephen and put in his place
-a man more to its liking. â¢ ;

The stay of the Knights of Colum
bus Jn the -city as guests, of the local
councils came to an end j*esterday.,with
a splendid -excursion to , the . topMof
Mount Tamalpais and a luncheon at the
tavern. . The, party returned to the city
during the afternoon and with its re
turn the part of the local commtttee as
host in welcoming and caring for, the
visitors was concluded. *
For the; last two days , the Knights
have ; been . leaving, for their. Eastern
homes, g large delegations departing
Thursday evening en route to Portland
and the Lewis and Clark Exposition,
while many more left yesterday morn-
Ing and afternoon. The last .of the
visitors, barring a few, stragglers, de
parted during the evening. The visit
ors expressed regret at leaving San
Francisco and California, /where they
have been most hospitably treated, and
many, spoke of returning in a short
time on visits. Hundreds of the Knlgths
promised to use every endeavor ito
bring the annual convention in 1907 to
the city by the Golden Gate.
The trip to the mountain yesterday
was ideal in every way. The heavy fog
of the . morning was slow: in lifting,
but as the ferry-boat passed opposite
the Gate it ran into sunshine that con
tinued throughout, the day. Two sepa
rate | parties of Knights were formed.
The first; left on the 8:10 a. m. boat
and the other on the 9:40 boat. Both
parties joined at Mill Valley and a spe
cial train of three cars hauled them up
the winding and steep grade to the
tavern near the summit.
â¢ On the' trip up. the mountlan expres
sions of wonder and rapture at . the
magnificent views were constantly
heard. Many of the Knights had made'
the trip up Mount Lowe and said that
the Tamalpais trip is far more enjoy
able.' Frequent stops were made to al
low the passengers to alight and linger
at special viewpoints.
At the tavern the Knights divided
into parties that searched the ravine,
took the .walk to the summit and
visited the observatory. At 12:30 o'clock
a call to luncheon was sounded and the
travelers sat down to an excellent re
past. Long tables, loaded down with
sandwiches, salads and fruits, including
a special dish of warm sardines, ap
pealed to the appetites of the visitors. 5
, At the conclusion of the luncheon
many of the Knights returned early to
the city in order to catch their trains.
Others, however, preferred to wait un
til the last train left the tavern and
the party going down the grade was
particularly jolly. The return trip
across the bay was passed without In
cident. ' \u25a0"* -r

AVOATAN'S MIND IS
BEYOND HIS SKILL
Charles M. Flckert, Third Assistant
United States 'Attorney;' has" been re
quested to tender his resignation^ - He
declines to do so. He has Informed
United States District Attorney Robert
T. Devlin, who made the demand, that
he would tender his resignation if the i
demand j were made upon political
grounds, but not otherwise.
Ever since the retirement of United
SUftes Senator Bard, Fickert has been
persona non grata on political grounds.,
He was appointed by the Attorney Gen-|
eral and United States District Attor
ney Marshall B. Woodworthon.the rec- j
ommendation of Senator Bard, Profes- j
sor David Starr Jordan and Benjamin
Ida .Wheeler. Woodworth, by reason of
having antagonized the party, adminis
tration because of his advocacy of the
re-election of Senator Bard as against
the election of Senator Flint," the choice
of the party leaders In this State, was
slated for dismissal at the close of his
term." Flckert, being" i . the same
canoe, -was "also placed on the slate in
big' capitals as a "has-been" and it was
an open secret that when Devlin should
assume office Fickert would be placed
on the greased ways preparatory to be
ing launched Into- the cold; cold world.
The climax was- reached when the
Jury:that tried Cress Unger for embez-'
zlement disagreed. Within half an
hour thereafter Devlin and Fickert had
a heart to heart talk In the District At
torney's office. -Devlin complained that
Fickert's mismanagement of the trial
was. responsible for the miscarriage of
justice. \u25a0 Fickert retorted by accusing
Devlin of' having "butted in" and
spoiled the case for. the Government by
preventing Fickert from asking: cer
tain questions and going into certain
features of the case. Then it was, say
the political gossips; that, Devlin de
manded his assistant's resignation.
Fickert. declined to hand It In on that
ground, but offered to do so should it
be requested solely on the ground of
political, expediency. : He refused to
resign under fire or. under the imputa
tion that he had mismanaged the Unger
case. He Is spending a vacation with
his bride on his father's ranch near
\u25a0 Bakerefleld. DevlinÂ«is on a vacation in
the - Yosemite Valley. It is believed
that before the courts resume their, sit
tings after vacation Fickert. will be re
moved and his successor appointed. \
Second Assistant District Attorney
Ben L McKinley is also said to. be
slated for removal. He was originally
appointed at the request of his cousin.
President McKinley, but that the
Kinley influence has been worn out was
evidenced a few months ago when Ben's
father, Benjamin F McKinley, the Presi
dent's uncle, was disrated from the
choice and .well paid.,ppsltjon,,gf. assist
ant postmaster . iri, this dty.'to 1 . that of a
position Involving more work and
much less pay.
During the Senatorial campaign,
which resulted in the election, of United
States Senator Flint, Assistant District
Attorney McKinley. was busily engaged
In "sawing- wood." . \u25a0
Notwithstanding the peculiar \ customs
governing, the operation of mines In
China, the result of the bureaucratic
"squeezing," there have been numerous
concessions granted to foreigners. Rus
eians are to work mines -in the three
Eastern provinces; Germans in Shan
tung; French in Szechuan, Fuklen and
Kiaochau; English in Ehansl and Ho nan;
Japanese In Annul: Italians in . Chen
klang, and Americans in Chilli. The
Americans will work gold mines, while
the British will be Interested In coal,
iron and silver mines principally. The
mineral resources of China are extensive,
but the Inherent secretiveness of the local
authorities has made it difficult to : pub
lish reliable statistics. It is known, how
ever, that the Iron mines of Tay eh, con
trolled by Japanese, ship annually be
tween 50,000 and 100.000 tons! to then Mi
kado. In Mongolia ! silver mining is : ac
tive, the annual output being 80,000 - or
IW.OOO ounces. There . are also profitable
gold \u25a0 mines in other \u25a0 parts : of the 'Chi
nese domain* and iln Hunan antimony
mining has grown, partly because of the
greater demand from the United States.
The production of the Cripple Creek dis
trict in ~ay amounted In value to $1,
564.215. The average value of the ore sent
to the smelters was 575 a ton. The lowest
value of ore on the average was S3 SO a
ton. Four companiesâ the Portland. Eco
nomic, United States and Dorcusâ show
tn average of from XS& to $25 a ton.
â¢31IM.XG IX THE ORIEVT.
At Dale in San Bernardino County, -100
tons of ore are crushed each twenty-four
hours. Many miners are at work.
A report is circulated that the Kennedy
mine struck the main ore body on the
2750 level. The shaft will be sunk to a
depth of 3000 feet.
A chrysoprase deposit Is to be devel
oped by the Himalaya Mining Company
of New York, near Porterville, In Tulare
County.
F. A. Kribs of Oregon will prospect
land along Dry CrÂ»ek in Amador County,
northwest of lone, as a dredger proposi
tion.
In the eastern part of San Bernardino
County is a mineralized country in which
eeveral mines are worked along the Colo
rado River south of Needles and near
Parker and Bill Williams fork.
Salt, marble and other minerals have
been found In the Danby dry lake, thirty
miles south of Danby in San Bernardino
County, on the Santa Fe Railroad. Rock
salt is reported to underlie from 600 to
Â£00 acres. Here is also reported to be
one of the largest gypsum deposits In
the United States.
VARIETY Ol' MI.VKRALS.
During the past week the old channel
cf the Hupp & McMurray mine, In Trin
ity County, that has been operated since
1859, has been declared worked out and
operations will cease.
After a lapse of twenty-seven years
the incline on the Mohegan mine at Gold
Flat has been found In good condition, so
reports the Grass Valley L'nlon.
If expectations are realized the opera
tions of B. S. Ryett of Denver may re
sult in largely facilitating mining at
Tanana. Ryett is now reported to be at
Nome engaged in the construction of a
dredger at a cost cf $100,000. Later he
will co to Fairbanks, where a seventy
mile ditch is to be made, sufficiently high
to put water on every creek and gulch
and bench in the Tanana district.
The Old Dominion emelter at Globe,
Ariz., produced 3,100,000 pounds of blis
ter copper In May.
In Yavapai County. Arizona, the Val
Verde Company will erect a new smelter
to cost $1,000,000. The smelter will be of
steel and of 600 tons daily capacity.
It has been decided by Judge Riner in
Colorado that ore shipped to a smelter
or reduction plant is the property of the
shipper, pending settlement by the con
eignees for values contained In the ore.
OrERATIOXS WILL CEASE.
The ideal reciprocal condition is about
to be realized in Nevada County, where
fuel produced in one part of the State
will be used to promote and develop the
mining industry in another section. The
oil of the Kern River district has been
found to be cheaper for use in the mines
than wood. Shipments of oil into the
county for mining purposes have been in
creasing until it is necessary to run oil
trains from Colfax to Nevada City and
Grass Valley.

fcaa been caused by the announcement of
Mr. Gilbert's arrival. The Government's

LONDON, June 16.â Part of the honey
moon of Prince Gustavus of Sweden and
his bride. Princess Margaret, King Ed
ward's niece, will be spent at Lismore
Castle, the beautiful Irish seat of the
Duke of Devonshire. The â¢ Duke has
loaned the place to them for as long as
they care to occupy It, but It Is not likely
: that their stay there will exceed a week.
Lismore Castle came into possession of
the ducal family as a hymeneal offering.
The heads of the house have a knack of
marrying heiresses, but none of them
profltdd more by thl3 happy trait than
the fourth Duke. He it was who married
the only child and heiress of the Earl of
Burlington and Cork. Thereby. In addi
tion to the castle itself, he added to his
estates 27,000 acres In the county ot
Waterford and 32,000 in the county of
Cork. Much property In England, too,
the lucky marriage brought him. includ
ing Chiswick House and Burlington
House, the first of which in the fullness
of time became a lunatic asylum and the
latter more fitly the home of the Royal
Academy. ,
Lismore Castle Is a large and imposing
pile, whose boldly restored battlements
frown to-day, with modern conspicuous
ness, above the Blackwater River, and
help one to for?et that King John and
Sir Walter Raleigh were really prede
cessors of the Devonshlres in possession
of the historic spot. The view from the
windows of the principal rooms Is very
fine, particularly the prospect from the
drawing-room.
The ballroom, which was at one time
used as a chapel, has an exquisite pointed
Gothic roof of woodwork and Is lighted
by stained-glass windows. The gardens
and terraces - are attractively laid out in
old-fashioned style. The great sight of
the demesne is the long avenue of yews.
the trees forming a complete archway
overhead. ,
The King and Queen stayed for a few
days at Lismore when they visited Ire
land last year and were very much taken
with it. It was rumored at the time that
the King had arranged t5 purchase the
place as an Irish royal residence, but the
Duke has not parted with it yet.

The Maid of Orleans is best remembered
for the time the ran amuck in the harbor.
She vti beating out to sea with all hands,
from skipper to cook, loaded to the brim with
water-front whisky and other combustibles.
After ' two or three tacks lt was decided to
lft the Maid eail herself while sk!ot*r and
crew indulged in a game of tag. The sport
was fast and Jurlous while !t lasted. The
Maid sailed as schooner never sailed , before;
*=he Jibed with generous swing whenever she
thought about it. while Dane. Swede and
Finn reeled giddily about the deck or chased
etch other up aloft, leaping from throud to
stay with the abondon peculiar to the ape
family. The wharves were lined with won-"
fit-ring critics, who tried In vain to account
for the ptrange antics of the Maid of Orleans.
The. fun ended most tragically. The Maid
crossed the bow of a big steel ship lying at
anchor. The schooner's foremast, on which
nve sailor*, were frolicking, fouled the ship's
bowFprlt. and with a crash toppled Into the
\u25a0rater, carrying to tht-ir death the five intoxi
cated t%g players.
There arrived off the port yesterday, bound
here frcm Mukllteo with a cargo of lumber,
the little schooner Maid of Orleans, once well
known at this port, but of whose existence the
local shipping world, bad almost forgotten.
This is thÂ« Maid # s first voyage in several years.
Fcr many months she was laid up on Puget
Hound. The revival of the lumber trade led
to her resurrection, and there was quite a
little etir on the Merchants" Exchange yester
day when Manager Jerry Daley, in fine Ital
ian iiand. wrote on the blackboard: â¢'Schooner
Maid of Orleans. C miles."

SCHOONER MAID OP ORLEANS. WHICH HAS BEEN AWAY FROM THIS PORT. WHERE SHK . .WAS ' ONCE "WELL
KNOWN, FOR TEARS AND WHICH SURPRISED THE SHIPPING WORLD YESTERDAY BY HER APPEARANCE^ OFF
THE PORT WITH A CARGO OF LUMBER. > ,\u25a0 ' / - ..
The Pacific ila.il Company's liner New
port. Captain Russell, which arrived late
Thursday night from Panama and way
ports, docked early yesterday morning
at Lombard street wharf. Following so
cose en the heels of the City of Sydney,
the Newport brought little cargo, but had
forty passengers. :3/^: 3/^-
Accordlng to the Newport's officers the
Panama Railroad is very much over
worked at present. An enormous
amount of freight is being received from
New Tork at Colon for the use of the
constructors of the canal. This freight is
given preference over through merchan
dise, and as a result shipments from New
Tarlt to ports on the west coast are get
ting through very slowly.
The Newport called at Salina, Cruz,
where she took oa board about twenty
people who had bees lured there by the
"get rich quick" literature of the Pan-
American LÂ«and and Improvement Com
pary. Sadder but wiser, they will in fu
ture seek investments nearer home.
Sal ira Crux frcm a place of a few huts
6ix years ago has developed into a bust
ling community of about 6300 population.
Thomas Pearson & Sons of London are
building wh&rves and breakwaters under
a $10,000,000 contract with the Mexican
Governments Other Improvements are bo
ing made, and within a few years Salina
Cruz will be ons of the best equipped
pens on the coast.
Wnile the Newport was at Panama a
negro laborer was killed by the train.
The other negroes, who had come on the
train to work cargo on the Peru and
Newport, refused to turn to until the
next day. They devoted the night to
mourning the tragic fate of their fellow
worker. The train hands joined in the
mournful joy, and until the dusky toilers
had h&d their fill of lamentation two
liners and the Panama Railroad were tied
up in idle waiting. '. ";:"\u25a0
Two deaths marred the Newport's out
ward voyage. Alexander Moody and W.
J. Clay, both steerage passengers bound
from this port for New York, died at A p.
na. on May 15. They not only died within
a few minutes of each other, but in each
ense the cause of death was pneumonia.
Both were old men. They were buried at
Bea.
Among the passengers who landed yes
terday from the Newport was B. K.
Pcarse, representative at Guatemala City
of Chalmers, Guthrie & Co. of London,
whither Pcarse is bound.
The Newport's passengers included the
following:
W. C. CodaJnzton. Prosper Orry. Arturo

R. G. Dun.& Co.'s weekly, review 'of
trade will say: Moderate Improvement is
noted in commercial conditions, ' although
progress is along conservative lines; and
there Is no' evidence ; of speculative . ex
cesses. Mercantile payments - are more
prompt, the brighter crop outlook having
a salutary effect on all commercial opera
tions. Railway earnings thus far avail
able for June average 8.7 per cent higher
than 5 last year's, j and foreign commerce
at this port for the last week shows gains
of $1,395,312 in exports and $3,636,898 in im
ports. In every department of business
the past week makes a strikingly favor
able {comparison with the corresponding
week of 1904.'" when prices were tending
downward and there was much complaint
of the early summer dullness, yet there
is no indication at the present time of the
unreasonable enthusiasm that threatens
stability^ through reckless purchases in
excess of "wholesome consumptive re
quirements. Irregularity continues in the
hide market. Many divisions are nom
inal, and foreign dry hides have declined
another fraction, making a loss of a full
cent from the recent top point. -
Failures this week numbered 229 in the
United States, against 257 last year, and
25 .in Canada, compared with 16 a year

Ban Franci6co. members of the New York
Stock Exchange, furnish the following official
quotations of thst Exchange :
NEW YORK. June 16.â T0-<iays stock mar
ket dropped another notch toward the con
dition of absolute lifelessness. There was a
little spurt of activity in Reading and some
special saleg In the United Stales Leather
eiooks. If these are deducted from the day's
total the remainder will chow as low an ag
pr^gate of sales of any full day la over four
years. The movement in Reading was en
couraged by the dull resistance which that
*tock has offered to the week's depression and
tc rumors In circulation once more of a pro-
T'M-d increase in the division rate. The deal
ir.ps In the United States Leather Company
certificates was based on an assumption that
tht forthcoming Issue of the new securities
will be nude the oceatloa of some market
activity \u25a0 fcr their benefit. The comparative
activiiy in the certificates of the Japanese
4Â«A r*r cent bonds, which have been in de
mtnd ever since the news of the battle of
the eea of Japan, proved an inviting field for
thÂ» professional room-traders, bereft of any
other opportunity of effecting & sufficient price
movement te yield a profit on the day'e turn.
Transfers of bond* aJÂ» are free Irom the tax
which . arpllÂ«B to stock transfers, thus stim
ulating the tra/i'n*: in the Issue by the pro
>cÂ«Mona!s. Outside of thrÂ»e few myotAiU muve
mt-nts the market was In a torpid etate.
Mar.y of the most prominent stocks were not
traded in until late in the day. and in some.
es&Â«?s were not traded In at aJL There was
no transaction in St. Paul until 12:30 o'clock.
The supposition has been that the pur
chasers of the 6tock of the Equitable Life
Assurance Society and the terms of the. deed
of trust to the trustees were awaited to re
>at* the market from its* deadlock. The pub
lication of those facts this morning created
xrnt m. ripple in the market. It is now sur
mised that the delay is expectation of the
report of the State Superintendent of Insur
ance. The report of the week'e currency
movement excited only languid interest as
thf principal importance Is attached to the
loan item. The money market shows some
effeÂ«j cf the preparations for the half-yearly
settlement. Quotations are largely nominal,
ov.-ing to the almoct total lark of demand
for time funds. Banker* are little Inclined
to place funds at the existing quotations and
express hope of better rates later In the year.
There was some remaining uneasinecs re
ported from foreign markets on account of
the Moroccan situation. The May foreign
trade etatement afforded gratifying evidence
of the expansion of our foreign commerce. Of
the Increase in the value of exports for the
month of $24,000,000. compared with May of
last year, it is known that agricultural pro
ducts furnished $22,000,000. The . difference
goes to the credit of aa increase in manu
fccturir.g exports. Much Interest will be felt
Jn the later etatement ef the details of the
movement In order to ascertain how far thÂ«
*?i:port of steel products have been stimulated
by the lull In the domestic trade situation.
The signs of nervousness in the grain market
had no echo in thÂ« stock market.
Aelde from the Japanese 4% certificate* tht
bond market fas dull and Irregular. Total
bales par value, $4,310,000.
United States bonds were ail unchanged on

who : were becoming nervous over . prospects of
rust damage. .. A number of 'advices were re
ceived telling of the destruction of. wheat by
thle blight. A report by a St. . Louis trade
Journal touching on this subject was a specific
bullish Influence. According to this authority,
thrasMntf" returns reveal an uneven yield In

to damage by ruet.' ' In addition to the demand
from shorts a number of commission houses

of the session. At SS{4^BS%c the July^optlon

before rhe close there waa considerable profit
taking, resulting in some reaction.. The close,
ihowever, was strong, with july,at SS&@BBVic.

A strong tone prevailed in the -corn market
during the greater part or me session, i One of
the main, reasons - for the firmness - was the

at Liverpool and heavy rain In the corn belt.

were In free supply and easy except for a faw
lots of strictly fancy stock, which commanded
a small premium.
Miscellaneous vegetables -were . weak, with
all. descriptions In free supply. The canners

for Peas and green String Beans at the inalde
rates. Some Lima Beans appeared from
Coachella and sold at 12% c per pound. Fancy
Mississippi Tomatoes were held at $1 40 per

of murder. Charles Buelna, hodcarrier,
who was shot by Jaiser in a saloon at
Jsinth and Mission streets shortly after
midnipht Wednesday morning, died at
the Central Emergency Hospital about
2 o'clock yesterday morning. Jaiser
at first denied firing the fatal shot, but
later admitted doing so, but claimed
he- had acted in self-defense, as Buelna
had attacked him. He denied that he
left the saloon and went to his room
for his revolver, but the police have
evidence that he did so, showing pre
meditation. Jaiser is a painter, 64
years of age.

When he missed 515 from one of his in
side pockets the skipper of the [gallant
schooner Tidal Wave immediately sus
pected that it had been surreptitiously
extracted by Jessie Mason, with whom
he had engaged in conversation on the
street a few minutes. prior to his dlscov-'
cry of its loss. He imparted his suspicion
to a policeman, who arrested Miss Mason
in a saloon on the street which bears
her surname. In the court of Judge Mo
gan she asseverated that she had never
seen" her accuser until he took her breath
away by denouncing her as a thief, and'
then ehe was given till June. 2B to make
good her declaration of innocence.;
Mason Marion underestimated the vig
ilance and memory of the police, for two
months after he had . stolen an overcoat
and fled the city he considered it safe,- to
return to his former haunts, where he
was promptly ' arrested. Judge Mogan
gave him three months.
Nobody imagined that j Connolly /way I
actually demented until he proved his in- |
sanity by clambering- over the bars of
the prisoners' cage in Police Judge Con
lan's court and attempting to overpower
Bailiff "Jack" Laws. Then it was unan
imously agreed that no man in possession
of unimpaired sense would have under
taken such a hopeless endeavor, so the
Judge sent him to.be dealt with by, the'
Lunacy Commission. , / \u25a0
Connolly, who was baptized James T.,
served the Southern Pacific Railroad Com
pany as a special policeman until he: was
arrested at 2 o'clock yesterday morning
for wantonly emptying his revolver by
firing it while he was on duty at Ken
tucky and Channel streets. To the regu
lar police officer who was attracted to the
spot by the shots Connolly gave such
ambiguous explanation that he was sus
pected of inebriety, but his permanent
sanity was not questioned. He incoher
ently hinted of a man who had followed
him with evident . felonious intent, and
other remarks uttered by him. were, so
vague that the patrolman deemed it wise
to take : him into custody. iHe was tract
able from that moment until he made his
crazy break for freedom in the court
room. â¢ \u25a0 . '\u25a0\u25a0...'-
Veracious witnesses of the incident de
scribed it as extremely thrilling. It fell
upon the routine like a bolt from the blue.
His Honor gasped and 'sat back in his
chair, Clerk "Jack" Rice cast despairing
glances at the oncoming menace and. then
bolted into the Judge's . chamber, and
slammed the door behind him; the chair
warmers, men and women, rose en masse
and dashed doorward. . Only the sturdy
Bailiff Laws stood his ground. Involun
tarily reaching for his pistol pocket he
yelled "Go back there" to Connolly, who
ignored the command. Then they grap
pled, and only a moment was . required
in the subjugation of the lunatic and the
restoration of safety to the tribunal.
In a fight with roughs severaKmonths
ago Connolly received cranial injuries,
which are believed to* have resulted in the
dethronement of his reason.

ities. It was mad^- plain that in the

plaintiS^ he said she was without stand
ing In'Tthe. court and would have to bide
her tttne before she could even compel
the defendant to join issues with her and
try the case on its merits.
Hiram Johnson, who appeared for Mrs.
* Collins, characterized CoCins' stand as
monstrous. "There is no provision in
the law," he said, "that will compel a
deserted wife to hit with her children
gathered around her for the period of a
year, perhaps suffering: from hunger,
while her husband enjoys the luxuries
of life. A deserted wife, an. abused wife.

After Nevills had completed his state
ment an adjournment until this morning
was ordered.
"When we reached the meeting-room
Flemming was there, armed with a steel
cane. He told me that if I persisted in
holding the meeting there would be seri
ous trouble. Then Senator Jones, whb
was present, called me into the hall. He
said he had reached a time in life when
he did not care to take any acttve part
in a combat at arms and advised that I
adjourn the meeting. I yielded and the
meeting' was never held.
"It is my opinion that had the meeting
been held, an assessment levied and the
m!nes properly developed they would be
big* dividend-payers to-day and this liti
gation would have . not been necessary.
It. was the defendants in this case that
prevented the development of the mines
and the fact that they have not paid any
dividends is due to them alone."
"It was in IES7." said Nevills, "that I
decided to call a meeting of the direc
tors of the company for the purpose of
levying an assessment to develop the
property. Director Halsey told me not to
call the meeting; that Flemming was in
a rage and there would be blood spillet/
if I persisted. I told him I did not see
why a man should be killed for doing a
legal act. Halsey then told me that if I
called the meeting he. would vote against
me. but that made no difference and J
called the meeting. 1 did not take a re

A. S. NEWBURGH
Lawlor Checks Attorney for
Joseph; Itebsfbck Sharply
in Attempt to Bluster
DECISION^ IS DEFEREED
Court Will Pass on Motion
Asking for a New Trial
Next : Monday Afternoon
Attorney A. S. , Newburgh was severely
rebuked by Judge Lawlon yesterday dur
ing the argument ' for^a new trial in the
case of Joseph - Rebstock. of
violation of. the primary election law. At
the conclusion of the argument Judge
Lawlor filed an affidavit; setting forth the
details of the "ruse" attempted by:Reb
stock's attorney.' Similar affidavits were
filed by District Attorney i Byington and
Clerk Martin. The decision on the. mo
tion for. a "pew trial will be given next
Monday, and on the same date a counter
affidavit will =be filed by Attorney New
burgh. ' : .
> All through the argument every, attempt
upon the . Dart of Newburgh to' bluster
was quickly and forcibly stopped by the
Judge. * ; â¢ v \u25a0>.
â¢ "If - the ; court had been Inclined to be
fair to the defense In this caseâ" New
burgh'began at onetime.
Judge Lawlor checked -him- quickly.
"The court has often condoned your lan
guage," he, said, "but if you mean; to say
that the; court in this or any Mother case
has not been', fair to the defense we will
pause and take: action." .
- Newburgh Immediately subsided.' "1
merely referred to your Honor's instruc
tions "to the Jury," he said. "I could
hardly believe my ears when I heard
them." . j, .
. "The court. Is not responsible for your
Infirmities," retorted Judge Lawlor.
Attorney O'Grady took up the argu
ment, I advancing * the poinjt that as Reb;
stock has 'testified before the Grand Jury
that, inquisition was equal to a trial: This
line of argument brought caustic ' criti
cism from the court and from Assistant
District Attorney Ferral. : .
1 ''In our affidavit we allege compulsion,*'
remarked O'Grady. . '
. '-What right; .have you to do that?"
asked the. court.
.- "We desire to make our 'case as strong
as possible," replied O'Grady.
"A subpena is 'compulsion," spluttered
Newburgh, who was quickly checked by :
O'Grady.
â¢ After the three affidavits had been read
Judge Lawlor said: "I desire to exonerate
Attorney; O'Grady and ' Attorney. Bloch
from any part in. this proceeding."
"I will a ' counter affidavit and ex
onerate myself." declared Newburgh. i
"Well, do it," said the court. . "Don't
tell us what you are going to do."
"I move that the affidavit"â referring
to the one made by Judge Lawlorâ "be
modified," ventured .Newburgh.
."Motion' denied," responded the court. :
â¢JAre you going to pass. upon your own
affidavit?" stormed Newburgh. . .
"The motion is denied," said Judge
Lawlor decisively. .

ing. - Mr. Brown, she averred, came from

visit her, and , she would freely confess
that their relationship was tender. It
\u25a0was not to scold: or upbraid her that he
crossed the bay, because she .had; been

anything: that might, provoke; to
anger, and the unruffled /affection re
