PHILADELPHIA, Juno 19.â The Re
j publican City Campaign Committee to
| day announced that a subcommittee of
! three, consisting of Chairman James L
Miles, David Martin and David H. Lane,
had been appointed to meet a similar com- â¢
mit tee from the "committee of , twenty
ont" to consider a demand that the party
ticket named for the November r election
be \u25a0 changed. The committee is . empow
ered also to * see the candidates > and . en
davor to induce them to withdraw.
1 The possible naming \u25a0of a new ticket
will not necessarily 'cause a withdrawal
of ; the opposition to the Republican or
ganisation., under the leadership of I. W.
Durham. Mayor "Weaver and his friends,
who formerly, were strong allies of tha
organization, are - believed to be hostile
to any move that /will continue r the pres
ent .leaders \u25a0in \u25a0 power. " In addition, . ths
committee Â« of > seventy, a strong reform
organization. Is perfecting - Itaelt in every
ward, with the declared intention of plac
ing a ! ticket in the field independent of
what the Republican organization may
do..
The' reform leaders are apparently con
fident of theix. ability to defeat the regu
lar Republican ticket and they say they
will have' the support of Mayor Weaver
and practically, all ,of the* office holders
, recently appotnted,to -take the places of
the men removed since the Mayor's war
on -the organization, leaders wa3 begun.
Five policemen . and . one fireman were
discharged to-day. They had been found
guilty of charges preferred against them.

The morning session began at 9
o'clock with a short speech by Tempo
rary Chairman Phillips. He welcomed,
the delegates to the city, and then pre
sented President French of the local
tabor Council. President French dwelt
upon the necessity for organization and
the purpose of the -convention in con
*6lderingr the serious problems confront^
tag the craft the delegates represent.'
In particular he referred to the nine
hour Cay. He told of the work organ
ized labor had endured to get an eight
hour day in the city, and spoke of the
recent agitation for the old schedule.
* He spoke "of the pressmen's conslst
.ent and reasonable effort to gain con
cessions in which the best judgment of
both sides prevailed. Urging them to
eland flrm for their rights regarding
\u25a0working hours be then attacked the
Japanese labor question. On this sub
ject French said: \u25a0'â¢â¢ ._Â«â¢
* "Another important measure which
will come before you for consideration
is the matter of an unrestricted Japan
ese immigration. Those of us here by
the Golden Gate know to our sorrow
what the import of the Question is, and
we only desire that the peril may re
peal itself to you as it has to us that
we may stand together against this
menace, to American labor"
French's closing . remark illustrated
the necessity for men of training In' the
pressmen's walk of life. At â¢ the con
clusion he was followed by Mayor
Schmltz, who was introduced as "the
man who holds a card in the Musicians'
Union.** The Mayor - was ; well received
and spoke for a considerable period. ;Â«
The ' Mayor ' first described 'the favor
able labor, conditions of San. Francisco
and spoke in an -optimistic vein of Its
. effect on " other /cities ; of the United
COXTfEXTIOX OPENS.

"diately began. An adjournment was'

At the opening of the afternoon session
Delegate Stephen. Kane, chairman, of the
committee. on credentials, submitted a re
port seating 112 delegates.- A /fight, be
tween locals of two , New York unions was
referred to the- convention, as the com
mittee refused to judge the merits or de
merits'of the Scase. The principal ques
tion of -, the ; seating , of t delegates was that
of the Cincinnati delegation. The" Press
feeders'.' Union of . that: city > is lin - arrears
and their seating was objected 'to, '\u25a0', al
though Tthe /delegates \ averred that the
money was . here in â¢ checks that were \u25a0 de

to seat the delegates ; pending payment: of

and will 'deal with it. When , the heads

NEW. YORK, June' 19.â 1n an address
delivered to-night by Archbishop Farley
at Carnegie Hall at \u25a0 the J commencement
exercises of the .College of St. . Francis
Xavier, the announcement was made
that* the President had taken up the di
vorce problem with the Cabinet with a
view of putting an end to the national
evil. The Archbishop stated that he had
been authoritatively -Informed 'that the
administration la seeking a definite rem
edy.-^ The Impression created by the re
marks was that a national divorce law
is under consideration. . ;'
â¢ \u25a0 Dr. Hem phill Is a native of Hay hern
felt, 'j County Derry. . . north of Ireland.
Twenty-five years ago he was called to
the pulpit of Calvary Church, and
preached successfully for a number of
years, ; when . he left to accept a call to
the Arch-street Presbyterian Church.
Philadelphia, . and remained there five
years. Old preferences and the influence
of his wife drew him bacx to the coast.
St. John's called him and subsequently
he was persuaded to resume his old pul
pit. He feel 3 that hl3 work is done^ The
ctiurch is prosperous and out of ? debt,
with a splendid future before it. With an
unconquerable \u25a0 depression upon him. Dr.
Hemphill feels that he must make a
change.
The cause of Dr. HemphlH's resignation
arises from no dissatisfaction among the
congregation or from any decrease in
popularity; The church is one of the most
beautiful and substantial In the Stata
and Its Income is more than ample to
meet all expenses and to assist with un
stinted , liberality the many smaller, ones
which have been established .throughout
the state. \u25a0-,;\u25a0;; _ ,
.The reasons that have led to Dr.
Hemphill'3 resignation . are entirely per
sonal, and arise from the uttteV prostra
tion \u25a0 resulting from the ; sudden death of
his dearly loved wife. Rarely has a mar
ried .couple lived together \with 'greater
harmony and affection. The loss of Mrs..
HemphiU has proved a blo-wf ram which
the survivor cannot re"eover.*;He"has.de
termined therefore to settle up hi 3 affairs
( here ..and return to his birthplace, and
amid the familiar scenes of boyhood to
try T- to "regain his normal health and
'spirits.' "V .V \ :--' : - . ." ; -â¢\u25a0'
The congregation of Calvary , Presby
terian Church, the largest, -wealthiest and
most influential of the denomination In
the State, will be grieved to learn that
Dr." John Hemphill has determined to re
sign his charge and return to the land of
his* birth. Only to a few of . the trustees
of' the church Is the pastor's decision
known. " ! â¢

possible explanation for this alarm is
that: Admiral Tirpttz has been anxious
to test the preparedness and speed with
which the navy could be placed on a

the, officers should feel the thrill and

order to bring out the best in them.

A^ dispatch .fto* the" Temps, from- Metz
says r that i the Sixteenth ..German Army
Corps * iss showing J less , activity than the
TjWeptieth and Bixih French lAJrmy Corps,
as ihe; Sixteenth Uernian Army Corps has
beeh-'icdntinuahy/on av^var footing and is
prepared for immediate mobphzation. . The
dispatch i says that the ; inspection .of
troops hap been active on .both sides.
However, this activity has been less
marked' recently t as * ail eyes have befen
turfied ; toward Paris ' in \u25a0 expectation of 7 a
favorable result of the * diplomatic nego
tiauons. - : :-W ' â¢ >i- â¢;-' s - " "
With both Governments favorable to'
the 'sovereignty of i Morocco and to â¢ her
territorial and political status quo,' it re
mains for the conference to adjust / the
equality "of commercial rights, as Ger
many desires this assurance from . an' in-*
tcrnu tiouai conference Instead of through
the operations of , : the (Anglo-French
agreement. -Therefore the "conference is
nut likely to consider changes in the po
litical â¢ statua of fMbrocco,'; but .rather .in^
ter national reforms" and commercial priv
ileges.
.Although ,the basis of the , conference
has not yet â¢ been settled It is", understood
that the two .Governments, substantially
agree'; on' .'Some of the main features in-,
.volved.:^ Germany has suspected that
France had designs on the sovereignty of
Morocco,.. but tiie : negotiations .disclosed
that France had not questioned this sov
ereignty. Similarly it was disclosed that
France had not designed to | interrupt the
pi esent j territorial; or | political status quo
of { Morocco. This appears to have | been
qne of Oermaiiy's chief. apprehensions, as
a"riy,^change in Morocco's status qiio might
involve \u25a0 an i ultimate | Frencn protectorate
similar tv tliat over Tunis. ':
y This vreÂ»uM^x after ? severe 'strain
which - tested the diplomatic, iesourc*es of
both Governments,' has- the -'effect -.of re
lieving ..the*.' tension. ' the - officials , of % the
Foreign* Ottice^and the \u25a0 diplomats ; of : the
German I kmhassy s agreeing : that an ami
cable \u25a0 adjustment ! Is ; near^ at ' hand: c . .
Although the acceptance of the confer
ence j gives : a certain : irieasure of success
to . German . dlp.omacy, yet ' Rouvier
emerges from the ; c6ntroversy .* with the

WASHINGTON, June 19.â Kbgoro Ta
kahira, the Japanese Minister, called at
the White House to-day to inform the
President that the Japanese plenipo
tentiaries \u25a0would be able to reach "Wash
ington the liret part of Augtfst if it
were deemed desirable for them to be here
by that time. The persdnncl of the mis
sion has not yet been announced.
When the President returned .to the
executive office after receiving Mr. Taka
hlra he found Count Cassinl, the Rus
sian Embassador, awaiting? him. The
Information, brought by the Minister
was communicated: to the Embassador,
who Is cabling his Government to-night
to learn when the Russian mission will
arrive. When this is known it will be
possible to decide upon, a date. f or \ the
conference. The 'general belief Is that
it will convene about the middle of
August .. .:
As has-been reiterated in these dis
patches, Japan will not ask for an ar
mistice, insisting that the initiative
must come from Russia. 'l, The optimistic
reports' of the last few days received in
St. Petersburg from, the, front, have
greatly raised the hopes of the Russians
that a land victory is near, and the war
party is opposed to the Bending of a re
quest for an armistice "at this time.
Japan Is not at all desirous of a tempo
rary" cessation "of hostilities, for, be
tween now and the beginning of the
rainy season in August, Oyama is ex
pected to accomplish great achieve
ments in Manchuria. However, after
Â£he plenipotentiaries have been appoint
ed the informal discussion of an arnii3
tlce will be resumed, and in case the
President takes the j initiative in sug
ge'stihg a limited truce. bpth belliger
ents will give the. matter. .serious con

CALL BUREAU, POST BUILDING,
WASHINGTON, June 19.â President
Roosevelt says that the forests of Cali
fornia will be preserved. He believes
that the giant redwoods, that have lived
through three thousand years of senti
nel duty on the slopes of the California
hills and mountains, are absolutely
necessary to the well-being of the agri
cultural development of the State, and
the timber cutting tendency must stop.
The President has not sounded the
alarm too soon. A glance at the rec
ords of the Geological Survey shows
that while there has not been any
material dimunition of the rainfall in
California during the past twenty
years, there has been a noticeable
shrinkage of the waters of California
streams. The stretches of "burnt"
country and "small timber" sections
have increased by thousands upon
thousands of acres and the under
growth's ability to hold the seasons'
moisture has ' not been demonstrated.
Tree destruction is not confined to- the
mere cutting of trees for lumber and
fuel. Sheepmen and mining prospectors*
have wrought much unnecessary dam
age to forests. The young trees have
not been protected and insufficient'at
tention'has. been given to reforesting.
Now all will be different. The
Bureau of Forestry has taken up the
study of reforesting 'with vigor and to
the Important work the President-has
given a great deal of personal atten
tion. The result has been the creation
of the Maury Mountain, Oregon, reserve
and the Lassen Peak reserve. The lat
ter includes 900,000 acres and Is. in one
of the finest timber sections of > the
State of California. Sugar pine and fir
is the principal growth, with occasion
al patches of redwoods.
The Lassen reserve has been created
to . preserve the . water courses that will
be required in years to come to carry out
the various reclamation projects. Four
big lumber concerns . have been closing
In on the billions of feet of lumber in
the great Lassen- district, but the new
reserve will check them.
The . Bureau of Forestry has been ex
perimenting in reforestation in the San
Gabriel Mountains \ back :; of Pasadena.
The results of the Government tests have
been very gratifying and on the chap
arral-covered slopes a fine, sturdy growth
of young timber, has sprung up which has
greatly assisted in. preventing the winter
rain waters , from being carried ; off too
rapidly. Many Southern California farm
ers and several v irrigation companies
have sent letters to the bureau at .Wash
ington asking that certain watersheds ad
jacent to 'Anaheim, Riverside and Santa
Ana be - reforested \u25a0 and the ; work is soon
to be taken up. \u25a0 . \u25a0
One of the most Interesting experiments
that has been made -; by the Bureau iof
Forestry is that with , redwood seed.'*.- The
problem; of ' reforesting, depleted 'redwood
districts and of growing redwoods In sec
tions ; where the . trees have not lived was
for a longtime" a,puzzling7one,':b'ut.lt r :is
believed that Ranger Lewis L. -Davis of
the - General Grant , National Park,- ; in
California.* has solved '. it. Davis s writes
that under certain ; favorable conditions
the redwood tree does reproduce J itself.
He tried the planting r of redwood seed 'in
various kinds \u25a0of soil ; and * underY widely
varying climatic conditions;? but the \u25a0 seed 1
failed to - germinate. ; v He : noticed ?;that
when. a. thin, coating of ashes .was spread
over the ground - the': redwood v. seedlings
seemed : to flourish \u25a0 and ; he ; therefore \ tried
tho seeding ; of 'an ' extensive ' acreage! with
the soil thus treated, with the' result'that
a grove ". of l<oo \u25a0 young , trees I has I devel
oped and â¢Is . waxing stronger and strong- 1

ZEAL OF AN ATHEIST
ENEICHES A CHUECH
Mrs. de la Pasture expresses a particu
lar liking for America and Americans,
and tells me that she desires above all
things to make her first journey across
the Atlantic.
. Her married life has been passed alter
nately in Devonshire, London, and her
beautiful home in the Wye Valley, where)
not three miles from the ancient ruins
of Tlntern Abbey, visited / annually by
hundreds of Americans, LJandogo Priory
stands looking down upon the river and
the quiet village from which it takes its
name.
they â¢ accepted the book, which was al
most Instantly successful. "Adam. Grig
son." "Catherine of Caials" and "Cor
nelius" followed. The new novel "Peter's
Mother' is an ultra-quiet narrative of a
somewhat narrow, formal country ; life,
containing little of excitement, but much
of human nature, and I that highest liter
"ary art which conceals art. This .book,
like all of her others, was written first
in. the form of a comedy and then put
into narrative form.'
ThJs thrice-happy author was born and
brought up in Italy, her - grandfather.
Edward Bonbam, C. 8., being Consul
General at Naples. She spent her girl
hood in Calais, where her father was Con
sul. She comes of an old Essex farrfUy,
distinguished In the army and navy and
In the diplomatic service. The bead of
her family. Sir George Bonbam. Bart.,
was Minister at Belgrade when the Ser
vian King and Queen were assassinated
two years since : and her brather. Colonel
Walter Bonham. D. S. 0.. is military
attache at the British Embassy in Paris.

published " four novels, each of which
outran Its predecessor by an edition or
two, but It Is her latest work. "Peter's
Mother." which has brought her sud
denly Into general notice. It was pub
lished In February, went into a second
edition in two weeks, and has averaged
a new edition every three weeks ever
6lnce. Furthermore, the author has not
only dramatized the book herself since
then, but has placed the dramatic
rights with one of the most successful
managers in London.
But perhaps the most significant fact
of al! concerns a little charity play that
was given here in February.' Mrs. de la
Pasture is a rich and fashionable woman,
and when she wrote a little comedy to be
given- by amateurs for a fashionable
charity the newspaper critics all had to
go to it. The custom with the weary
critics in such cases Is to write polite
nothings, or to treat the play with gentle
satire. But those. who went to scoff re
mained to praise, and we were informed
by all and sundry the next day that by
some miracle a society amateur charity
comedy had been written that was ac
tually and seriously worth seeing, even
Irom a critic's lofty viewpoint. The play
was called "The Lonely Millionaires" and
was stage managed by the author, who
took one of the leading roles. The cast
was headed by the Earl of Altamont.
The> success of the production resulted In
a little flood of offers from London man
agers for a new play.
Mrs. de la Pasture is an amateur
actress of much renown, having played
in the oldest and best known amateur
clubs, the Old Stagers at Cariterbury and
the Windsor Strollers at Windsor. For
many years past she has played â and
often written the play herselfâ in Lord
and Lady Clifford's annual theatricals at

VISITORS FROM CANADA
.COLON., June 19.â 1t was publicly an
nounced that John F. â¢ Wallace, chief en
gineer of the canal zone, who sailed for
the "United States on June 16. was going
home by order of Secretary Taft for the
purpose of a consultation -on Important
matters prior to the sailing of the Secre
tary for the Philippines, and that he was
not likely to return to the isthmus until
his annual report had been written. .
Since the departure of Wallace, how
ever, it has been said in influential cir
cles that he does not intend to return
to the Isthmus to resume his position as
chief engineer, but that he has gone
home to confer with Secretary Taft on
the subiect of his resignation.
Shortly before he sailed Wallace was
the recipient of a memorial from the
heads of departments ,oa behalf of tha
canal employes, expressing deep.apprecia
tion of the benefits resulting from the
new schedule of hours and wages, and
from the betterment In the general wel
fare of all connected with the work on
the canal.
The fact that Wallace went, horns ac
companied by his wife and his two sec
retaries seems in â¢ some quarters to â¢ lend
credence to the rumor that he does not
intend to return.

Andrew Dahl, longshoreman, of 20
Federal street, says: "When a man has
had backache for four or five years,
some of the attacks being so pro-
nounced, particularly when he caught
cold, that it was a difficult matter to
perform a day's work with any de-
gree of ease, that man knows what
backache is. I always thought there
was some medicine which would act
directly on my kidneys and bring
relief when these attacks occurred,
but until I used Doan's Kidney Pills
I met with very little success. I just
told my wife the other night that for
the last six months my. back i was
never in better shape, and I attribute
the change to the use of Doan's Kid-
ney Pills."

it should have been under the city

The address urged the summoning of a
national assembly, that the war might
become national or cease, and concluded
with a solemn reminder of the sovereign's
duty to ood and *o the fawerland and a
prayer for action before It was too late.
The address adopted by the all-Russia
Zemstvo and Municipal Congress assem
bled at Moscow v/as taken to St. Peters
burg for presentation to the Emperor by
a deputation headed by Count Hayden
and M. Shipoff, former president of the
Moscow Zemstvo. but It does not appear
from the cable dispatches that 'the docu
ment was handed to' his- Majesty, al
though donbleES Prince Troubetskoy and
M. Fedoroff In . their speeches communi
cated the substance of the address to, -the
Emperor. The document in its original
form bids fair to become historic. The
customary- phrases- of respect at the open
ing and closing were omitted and It was
otherwise unceremonious; employing the.
direct personal pronoun.
The address arraigned the bureaucracy
and reminded the , Emperor that his
pledge to convoke a national assembly
was slow of fulfillment. It said the coun
try was oh the verge of . civil war - and
even ventured to criticize a royal meas
ure, contrasting the increase of the police
power by the. ukase issued on June 4 with
the weakening of the administrative pro
cesb which the country had been led to
expect. â¢.

Dr. Mayhew made no attempt to conceal
the fact that he is the person referred
to In the \u25a0 rumor of Irregularities. He
spoke most bitterly of the minority, say
ins that the whole trouble grew out of
the failure cf Drs. Cool and Dunn to
control the actions of the board despite
th* opposition of "an overwhelming ma

LOS AKGEI.ES, June 19.â The members
of the State Board of Dental Examiners
arrived in Los Angeles to-day and an
nounced a determination to settle during
their sessions here the differences between
the majority and the minority and to
probe the recent scandal with reference
to the selling of examination questions. "
The feeling of bitterness between the
factions has been intensified since the
recent stormy sessions in San Francisco.
By common consent it has been decided
to d<c!arc a sort of armistice until after
the fifty-four applicants to be examined
here have been put through their paces.
A private telegram from Sacramento to
night stated that the Governor has al
ready taken cognizance of the matttr and
has begun a quiet investigation without
waiting for the board to act. Every
member of the board was asked to-night
for a statement of the trouble. President
Baird declined to discuss the matter at
al!. Secretary Herrick also fought ehy
of making a statement, as did Dr. White
and Treasurer Howard.
Not so with Drs. Cool and Dunn on the
one side and Dr. May hew on the other.
Cool and Dunn were together, and Cool
dia most of the talking, but Dunn as
etnted to everything he said. Both agreed
that It was a case of five against two,
but they expressed the belief that they
would have the Governor with them and
that would more than make up for the
difference. Dr. Cool told of the allega
tions as to the sale of examination papers
and how the majority had ignored the
matter. Dr. Cool said:
But this matter of the examination papers is
net all t*jat Jf trcmbllr.r the minority. \u25a0 We ob

The fact that the Emperor not only re
ceived the bold, plain-spoken address
without so much as an indication of his
disapprobation, but expressed full sym
pathy â¢with the efforts to ameliorate the
deplorable state of affairs depicted there
in and in the most direct and explicit
fashion renewed his promise to summon
the representatives of the people, made
the deepest impression on the delegation.
Upon completing his remarks the Era
perur graciously greeted the Individual
members of the delegation, shaking hands
with them and having a few cordial
words for each.
. "Dissipate your doubts. My will, is soy-:
ereign, and it is my unalterable will that
the admission of elected representatives
to the work of the state shall be regularly
accomplished.
"1 watch daily and devote myself to
this work. You may announce that to all
your friends in the country and town.
"1 am firmly convinced that Russia
will emerge strengthened from the trials
she is now enduring and that there will
be established soon, as formerly, a union
between the Emperor and all Russia, a
communion between myself and the men
of Russian soil. This union and commun
ion must serve as a basis for the orig
inal principles of Russia.
"I have faith in your desire to help
me in this task."

.no doubt you arc guided by an ardent
sentiment of love for the fatherland in
addressing me directly.

with all my people, at the calamities
which the war has brought upon Russia
and at all those which may still be feared,
as well as at our internal disturbances.

' "Alderman Hamburger of New York City
has been In office three and a half years
and has married 6000 people. \u25a0 :
Aged Solomon A- Kusel. wholesale
butcher, has at last found the way to
safety from the litigation waged so per
sistently for years by his young wife.
For him It lay across the silent river of
death, and yesterady he laid down all
the burdens of legal strife that piled
upon ; his stooping shoulders and passed
to the beyond. He had suffered all the
woes that frequently come to men in the
winter of life who take in marital em
brace the blossoms of May.
Eight years ago the old man. who had
amassed a considerable fortune, became
enamored .of a woman much bis Junior
and married her. - Since that time she haa
filed four different suits for divorce; be
sides-two or three for maintenance, and
had kept hlnAconstantly In litigation.
He. even brought suit to stop- her from
suing him. Litigation .was so . expensive
that the . old man took up the study of
law at 78 in the hopes of saving attor
ney's f ees. -
Mrs. : Kusel succeeded in getting a - de
cree- of- divorce and a lump judgment of
$10,000 for maintenance in the Superior
Court, . but on I May 27 last the ' Supreme
Court set aside the decree and the main
tenance , judgment. This was a victory
for, Kusel. but it was only a decision giv
ing a new trial. He couldn't escape trials
until death stepped in. His attorneys ex
pressed the opinion at the time of this
decision that he would never live .to go
through another. battle In. the courtsT
Besides the , widow, who will now in
herit a large share of his property. U it
is not tied up, the deceased leaves a
daughter, Mrs. Harry J. Shannon, two
brothers, Edward A. Kusel of Oroville
and David Kusel of P t. . Louis, and two
grandchildren, Mrs. Joseph Bauer and
Walter Kusel. The deceased was 79
years old.
Most of the suits brought In the lower
court by Mrs. Kusel were won by her
husband, against whom she made
charges of desertion and cruelty. In the
Injunction proceedings brought by him
to , stop her suing ' him be alleged the
suits were only brought to annoy him
and that he was In his declining years
and. needed peace. \ â¢ .:
The ' estate of . the deceased was esti
mated to bo worth $30,000 at the time
Mrs. Kusel was awarded the $10,000 for
maintenance, that order being mad,* by
Judge ' Hebbard.

The death of Colonel Arthur I* Wag
ner, U. S. A., en Saturday, just as the no
tification was being handed to him of his
promotion to be brigadier general, has
caused deep sympathy and grief in army
circles. Colonel Wagner was widely
i:r.owr. throughout this country and Ger
many as a military text writer. His
death was the result of galloping con
sumption.. He was suddenly taken ill last
February and at once went to Ashville,
N. C, where his death occurred on last
Saturday.
Colonel Wagner was the leading text
writer in the United States army. Among
his principal books were "Security and In
formation,* "Organization and" Tactics,"
"Catechism of Outpost Duty," "Elements
of Military Science" and "The ' Study of
the Campaign of Koenigratz, the War of
ISG6." This latter work was spoken of
highly in Germany as an interesting and
complete study.
The distinguished writer will be re
membered in the army as the ' officer
through whose labors the United States
army was emancipated from the compul
sory study of foreign made text books.
He was an ardent military student, a
man who lost no opportunity to add to
his knowledge, already large, with - the
ultimate intention of making a code and
arranging it for publication for the bene
fit of his fellow officers. His loss will be
keenly felt by the entire army. No con
jecture can be made at present as to his
possible successor as text writer.
At the time his promotion took place
he was colonel and adjutant general, mil
itary eecreary's \u25a0 department, general
staff. His death will deprive the staff

In the soft-sounding Spanish names of

which' appeals to all visitors and to the
dwellers ,in all other, lands where tba
native son may wander. To preserve
these names Is the self-imposed mission
of every true born or adopted son and
daughter of the Golden West. When
some chlettet from his desk in the Post
offlce' Department orders the amputa
tion of ''San Such-and-Such" to plain
â¢/Such" the California Club and the
Promotion Commltee rise in their might
and beseech Uncle Sam to have the
pruning done. In some State where the
names dp not so musically tell the story
of theplacesThey designate. There are
hot many Eastern visitors who have
not i been \u25a0 corrected for speaking about
"'Frisco." "Cajifornlans always > say.

missionary work of years. v" . - ;~. ,-;.

visitor â¢is \u25a0 warned: "Better not â¢ talk
about '"Frisco', when you get there." He
hears .the conductor on the overland
singout: ; "Change here for San Fran
cisco.". 'The hotel clerk Is likely to
correct; him If he speaks of '"Frisco."

\ Bjc. this, time a large crowd had gath
ered and f they: folowedv; the patrolman
to \u25a0 the signal ;box.' There 'â¢ he - rang , for
the "patrol wagon and, seeing this, the
girl again struggled with him. Kramet
beat her cruelly about- the head and
then kicked her again and again.' Slo
cum was in the crowd and attempted to
remonstrate, but he, too, was treated
shamefully and ', placed . under- arrest.
Wren, whom some allege. to have been
perfectly sober, was powerless to drag
Kramer from his. unfortunate prey. -
.7 When brought up before the Chief of
Police, Kramer, said; he was accosted. by
the women and. that one of them struck
him without cause. . Last might both
policemen; gave the following signed
statement to Captain Duke: , \u25a0
Last night we reported off at 12:15 a. m. an>l
went to McDonough's saloon . at Â» Chty and
Kearny streets. - There we talked for about an
hour and had about five drinks of mineral wa
ter. Then we went to a restaurant on Kearny
street, * near Plna. ' ..We . left this place. at 2:20
a. '. m. and . met two \u25a0 women on Kearuy street,
near. . Sutter. .They solicited us to go with
them. .When we - reached Kearny and Geary
streeta we placed them under arrest for solicit
ing. .-: At c the box ; one "of the women, named
Pearl Barcy, \u25a0 struck Kramer "in the mouth.
After she bad -hit' him a .bystander Interfered
by sayingr. "Let . them i go," cr words , to thit
effect -and we placed this man, named F. Slo
cum,-under arrest for interrerlnr with an of
ficer.-' Ttie casea are continued â¢ till Wednesday.
Vi'tf afterward â¢ learned that these women were
prostitutes at Belden place.
According to the .statements of the
eye-witnesses the disgraceful affair oc
curred kbout 3 o'clock yesterday morn
ing when a number of pressmen were
going home from their work. Tho.two
girls # were walking down Kearny street
when' .Wren stepped 'up and began to
talk with them. Kramer rushed in a
moment later, seized one of the .women
by the waist and started to run with
her. She screamed and Kramer swore
at her, telling her that he was an offi
cer and that he would fix her if she
opened her 'mouth again. Nothing
daunted, the woman struck at him and
hit him in the face. This infuriated
Kramer, and he lunged viciously at his
helpless charge.
Chief of Police Dlnan. has. ordered an
investigation of the, charges against
Policemen John H. Kramer and T. F.
Wren, tiled by Henry Hunter, a press
man employed by one of the moraine
papers, alleging brutality in the arrest
of two women on Kearny street early
yesterday morning. Both minions of
the law were attired in plain clothes
and were oft duty at; the time! Hunters
says they were drunk and thaf Kramer
acted more like an infuriated beast
than a keeper of the : peace. It is
against' the latter officer "that the most
serious offense is charged. There. were
several witnesses' to the affair and they
corroborate 'the story of Hunter.' Cap
tain Duke has taken charge" or the in
vestigation. Tho'two women; Ruby Mil
ler and Pearl Barcy, were arrested, to

OAKLAND. June 19.â Chief of Police S.
C Hodgkins will be ordered before the
Board of Police and 1- .re Commissioners
at Jt*> Tegular meeting Wednesday to
make explanation of his action in per
mitting lottery, company agents to muti
late a 57500 winning ticket while it was
in his possession as evidence in the case
of John Perry. ' ,
Hodgkins has issued a formal state
ment of his conduct. He has taken the
position that the only criticism that can
be made is that he was. "indiscreet and
thoughtless." In his statement Hodgkins,
makes no reference to the situation' as
involving the possibility that an offense
against the laws of the State was com
mitted in his presence when the evidence
was mutilated. Nor is there any explana
tion as to why he failed to lay the mat
ter before the District Attorney after the
act had been accomplished. #
The Chief's statement, in part, follows:
"I freely admit that I was indiscreet in
the matter. It was done in a hurry, oc
curring: about 12:40 p. m., and bad I the
slightest idea that there would be a con
test or aoy court proceedings I certainly
would not have done it. Believing Isaacs
and Babbero to be the only persons in
terested and their promise not to contest
our tight to seize the tickets I consented
to the canceling, but not the mutilation
of the ticket. \u25a0 â¢ . ,
"There was no motive or idea of wrong
doing on my part, the only consideration
being, 'Thank you,' and I court -the full
est investigation, knowing full well it
was simply a thoughtless act;" â¢
The authorities are investigating the
case with relation to the bearing of sec
tion 113 of the Penal Code on the case.
This section reads:
JSvery officer bavins' the . custody' of eny
record, map. or book, or any other paper, or
proceeding of any court," filed or deposited ! In
any public ofllce. or placed In his hands for
any purpose, who is guilty of stealing, will
fully destroying, mutilating:, defacing, alter
lnp or falsifying, removing or secreting, the
whele or any part of such record, map, book,

more than fourteen years. . -
Special Dispatch to Tl.e Can.
OAKLAND, June 14.â Mayor Mott
sent ( a message to-night to the City
Council covering . the work . of : his j of
fice in trying to solve the. troubles with
the Pacific Incinerating Company over
the collection ;of the city's garbage.
Th Mayor included in" the message 'a
mass of correspondence had with the
company, and "dating from April 11. a
few days after he assumed office," down
to the. present. His Honor adds: ;
\u25a0 It " will be observed that this office has en
deavored to compel .'the Incinerating \u25a0 company
to do its full duty In the matter, or gathering
and disusing of the city's garbage and waste
matter, and.it will also be seen that on every
occasion â¢ the company, through Its officers, has
aesuredme that Its service was being Improved
and that they were equipped to give satisfac
tion. Notwithstanding this my pfersonal ob
servation and investigation satisfy me that
they; are not sufficiently equipped nor are they
in a position to maintain this service in a sat
isfactory manner..-"- ' , . ' -.; â¢
After discussing the question in de
tail the Mayor concludes as follows:
In my judgment the Ideal : method' would be
for the city to own and operate the incinerator,
requiring all refuse -of whatever nature to be
brought to i the crematory! and charging the
persons bringing the. same. sufficient price per
ton to pay tta? i running expenses. \u25a0 There is,
however, . some question whether or not the city
hac the power' under -the charter to operate
such an establishment, but this matter should
receive your careful consideration. \u25a0~. v ... -
I s am informed that your honorable : body
adopted' a resolution directing- the- City At
torney to commence a suit agaJnst the Pacific
Incinerating Company to : have the contract
now- existing annulled. As this would entail
litigation; of an indefinite period, with no im
mediate, relief to be afforded, I< would recom
mend that this action be- not- pressed for the
present, and that Instead an Immediate in
vestigation be made to ascertain if some other
solution may not be" had and a garbage service
established which: will be satisfactory In all
respect*. ' â¢ . ' - ".:â¢\u25a0'. â¢ \u25a0 \u25a0 '-; ' . \u25a0"
\u25a0'In- conclusion I beg to suggest that In deal
ing with this important problem your honor
able body shall give its attention first to In
suring a continuance <of ths sanitary, methods ,
of destroying the garbage; second, there : must
be a sy3teni<that shall give a service sufficient
to the requirements of the household-era and
othÂ»r patrons; third, .'the financial side of the
question should b* carefully studied. Any
! changes that may be suggested ; to be made in
th-a contract must be* carefully considered so
that while the Incinerating plant may be helf-
Bustaining, the cost of this service, to the peo
ple must not be burdensome. ; \u25a0';' . I, â¢>;â¢:

OAKLAND. June 19. â The question of
who will have "to bear the loss as the
result of a bold swindle (Thereby a man
representing himself as James Irvine,
owner of a piece of realty on Dwight
way, near Bowditch street in Berkeley,
succeeded in selling it to Edward J.
Stewart and Milton J. Shepardson for
$4500. Is to be fought out In the courts.
By a decree handed down this morning
Sy Judge Melvin. the deed of the real
James Irvine was cleared of any cloud
that might have been cast on the title
by reason of the fictitious document
placed upon the records of the county.
The fact that neither Stewart nor
Bhepardson had sufficient money to buy
the lar.d, but borrowed $4500 fjom
\u25a0Warren G. Sanborn of Berkeley on
their djeed. complicai.es the matter, for
he threatens if Stewart and Shepard
son do not make his loss good, to sue
Arthur P. Holland and L*. X. Cobble
dick, who arc tl;Â« sureties on Stewart's
bond as a notary public. Stewart was
the real estate agent, part purchaser
and the notary who certified that the
real James Irvine appeared before him
and made out the deed to the land. The
action taken this morning by the real
Irvine was preliminary to clearing the
records from entanglements so as to
give Sanborn a fair Held in which to
engage with his creditors.

simmons at the "Lagoon" resort, where
Pitz was in training for a flght with

' He urged on the association officials
bringing the yachtsmen, golfers, poloista,
lacrosse players, turners and other or
ganizations into their . fold. He praised
the gymnasium of the Young Men's
Hebrew Association, saying it Is one of
the best he ever visited.
,He weht on record strongly as being
opposed to the fighting clubs. Ha saJd
there Is a big difference between fighting
and boxing. He understood there wero
so-called . clubs here manipulated by one
or two men who received the proceeds ot
the exhibitions. These, he said, were not
clubs under the athletic union rules. He
frowned upon the recent Interpretation
of the rules which allowed , the flghtera
training expenses. He said no such au
thority is delegated and if he Is called
upon to rule In the matter he will decide
against It.
He urged that boys be kept out In thÂ«
open air. that they indulge In any
healthful sport, and that the Pa
cific Association be especially, represented
at each annual meeting and said he
would like to see Mr. Harrison president
of the national- body. <He said he had
been royally entertained here . and will
leave to-night with ? sincere regret.
Among the other speakers were Herbert
Hauser, E- J. Lynch, D. IX Oliphant.
Colonel George C. Edwards. R. R.

R. R. rHoromedleu. "Waldemar Young *nd
R. A. Smyth.
He paid a pretty tribute to the Olympic
Club, which has made him an honorary
member.
Mr. Maccabe said the Amateur Athletic
Union is founded on sympathy to foster
the best in sport, not the spirit of win
ning at any cost. Prizes are not to be
won by reprehensible means, but honestly
and bravely.
He spoke of the necessity of indoor and
outdoor gymnasiums available for the
children in the heart of the city and said
be had the assurances of the Olympic
Club directors that they would lend their
best efforts to secure these desirable ad
ditions to the public playgrounds. He
said they tended toward a better life and
a truer humanity. ,
About the banquet board were the men
vho stand for all that Is clean and hon
| cst in the sr>orts of the field and tho
cinder path on this coast. Mr. Maccabe.
,who is both manly and approachable, has
made a marked impression upon all who
have been brought in contact with him
during his stay here.
President T. I. Fitzpatrlck of the Pa
cific Association welcomed the , guest of
the. evening. He thanked the directors
of the Olympic Qlub for the courtesies
they have shown the visitor and then in
troduced "William Greer Harrison as tho
toastmaster. Mr. Harrison said he es
teemed it an honor to be present and
said it was an occasion to be dignified.
He spoke of Mr. Maccabe as typical of
the- association he represents â whole
-souled, honorable and the right man for
the place. A man with head and heart
ir. the work.
Joseph B. Maccabe of Boston, president
of the Amateur Athletic Union, whom,
William Grcer Harrison characterizes as
"the greatest little man who has been
here since Roosevelt," was the guest of
honor last night of the Pacific Athletic
Association.
After . a season of Interest among the
athletes of the Academic League, the
coming of graduation brings the several
schools upon this side of the bay to an
accounting, to find out what shape they
will be In to meet opponents for the
year of 1905-1906. Many of the most prpm
ising athletes are about to be graduated.
: Lick High School won many honors
jin the last term. A review of the sit
i uation shows that the football squad
will be \ more materially weakened than
any other branch of sport. Of the State
championship football team, Marlus
Hotchkiss, captain and center; Fred
Moullen, punter and left guard: "Chick"
O'Connor, end; "White, tackle; Schmltt,
end;, Seminario, left half; Henry Snell,
fullback, and Merrltt will not return next
year. This leaves Bill Main captain-elect
and tackle; Arthur Hall, quarter; Keenan
and. Deacon, as veterans, from which to
start the nucleus of the new squad.
Polytechnic, the respected rivals of the
black and . gold, bids fair to turn out
a record team. this coming season. It is
stated that Toye Lowe, the crack Chinese
guard, and Harry McKenzie, captain of
the last year's squad, will return. Many
other men of gridiron renown have made
known their intentions of donning the
black and red uniforms.
Mission is badly demoralized by the
loss of most of the - likely players. In
fact prospects have been so dull that It is
doubtful whether the pink and green will
be" represented upon the checker board.
Lowell . will loose . several of its best
players. Cerf, captain "and the moving
spirit of the entire team, will graduate.
All other players with the exception of
Monteagle and Roncovlerl are under
graduates. . / â¢
Lowell does not lose a track man and
will stand a good chance for honors either
in spring or the fall. Mission and Poly
technic will not be affected materially on
the track. Wilmerdlng will lose Its
one-mller, Heldenreich, but the remainder
are good for several more contests,
v The swimming and tennis, champion
ships will In all probability be taken care
of by the black and gold athletes. Brom
ley, the, unbeaten record-holder of the 100
: and 220 yard events, will annex ten points
in the next tournament. Fay /at Wil
merding,'the only second to Bromley in
his races, has proposed to attend Lick.
Should this come about there would be an
addition of six more tallies for the
"Tigers."
In tennis Harold Gabriel of Lick, who
was second to Herbert Long, will In all
' probability be one of the promising play
ers of the Potrero School.- 'â¢'â¢:*.'â¢''. â¢',

EUROPE NEAR TO WAR.
t t 7 E have already called attention to the conditions found in
\A/ Chicago by Mr. Dalrymple, the Glasgow expert in public
V V ownership of street railroads. His statements as to the
Glasgow. lines are summed up under three heads: First â No labor
union permitted among the car employes. Second â No transfers
given on any Glasgow line. Thirdâ Overhead trolley on the whole
Glasgow system. â¢ "":\u25a0;
This information is of value. It gives a different view of the
Glasgow system. The fact that no transfers are given explains Mr.
Dalrymplc's statement that the present street railroads in Chicago,
owned by a corporation, give the people more for^their money than
the city roads of Glasgow give. We have no doubt that an analysis
of the street car operations in San Francisco would show that the
people here get much, more for their money than Glasgow \ gives.
The enthusiasm of Mayor Dunne and the municipal. ownership
party in Chicago over Mr. Dalrymple has rapidly evaporated. He
has had a banquet and made a speech on the object of his visit
to Chicago. Glasgow has only $i6;ooo,ooo invested in street rail
roads. He says they are run strictly as^ a business proposition,
and that early experience made it necessary, to separate them en
tirely from politics. The employes since then are paid and worked
the same as if in private employ, and are not pampered as a special
and favored class of workmen. Members of the city government
and other public officials are not permitted to have any patronage on
'the street railroads, and cannot get employment for anybody, nor
influence contracts. Last year the Glasgow road put over $1,000,000
into the repairs and depreciation fund; $500,000 went for interest
and sinking fund, and over $1,000,000 went into the surplus.
In Chicago Mr. Dalrymple finds municipal water works, and in
the report of the city engineer he learns that these works waste
85 per cent of all the'water that is pumped,, and that in forty years
not a dollar has been funded for repairs, replacements and exten
sions. As the influence of the public employes in Glasgow once
threatened to be so pernicious in politics that the lord provost pro
posed to disfranchise them, a threat that seems to have restrained
them, what hope is there that in Chicago or in any other American
city such employes will be any less than the dictators of a public
street railroad system?
Admonished by the conditions he found in Chicago, Mr. Dal
rymple in his banquet speech declined to recommend municipal
ownership of the street railroads of Chicago. He finds that a sys
tem that suits Glasgow is not of universal application. There the
city employes on the street roads get five holidays a year. Con
ductors and motormen are paid from $6 to $7 75 per week, working
nine hours a day. The car cleaners get from $5 75 to $6 50 per
week, and they are not permitted to slight their work. Every car is
washed and disinfected every night. Glasgow has 780,000 inhab
itants on an area of twenty square miles. The municipal cars carry
200,000,000 passengers a year. The longest haul is fifteen miles
and costs 15 cents. By not giving transfers the cost to the users
of the system is much greater than would appear by the schedule
of fares.
It is safe to say that if the Glasgow system were adopted in all
particulars and restrictions in an American city, the people would
revolt against it in less than six months. It is an excellent system
no doubt for ' Glasgow, but its strict business administration would
be impossible here, and its wages and methods would not be tol
erated. So it looks as though Mayor Dunne made a water haul in
getting Mr. Dalrymple over. It was expected that he was a fanatic
on the subject, an evangelist of municipal ownership under all cir
cumstances and everywhere. He was not invited to investigate
but to harangue, and the Mayor is disappointed because he has the
investigating and not the harangue habit. - . .
Mayor Dunne spoke at the Dalrymple banquet. His speech was
little better than a socialistic harangue that must have surprised the
guest of the evening. The Mayor said: "If Chicagoaccomplishes,
as she will accomplish, what she has set out to do, it means an
economic revolution in America. It means not only the municipali
zation of street car plants, light plants and water and telephone
plants in cities, but it means government ownership of railroads, of
telegraphs, telephones and express companies in the United States.
It means the establishment of a parcels post and the abolition of
strikes and lockouts in connection with the management of such
utilities."
That comes as near the Socialist programme of "Everything
belongs to everybody" as any public official has yet ventured. The
Mayor said this with knowledge of his engineer's report that 85
per cent of the water pumped by Chicago's municipal plant is
wasted and that not a dollar has been saved for betterment and ex
tension in forty years! If Chicago is to be an example to cause a
socialist revolution in the country, she would better begin, by ap
plying a business policy to water administration. If all the utilities
mentioned by the Mayor were in public ownership and adminis
tered like the Chicago water works, the country would be hope
lessly bankrupt in less than five years.

erstein were appointed a temporary com
mittee to start the work of obtaining
written agreements for the beautiflcation
of the first block and with power to ap
point a permanent committee to work on
the entire scheme.
Mrs. H. H. Fassett suggested the plant-
Ing of. flowers along the sides of the ave
nue. -.'.,-
ThÂ« architect said the cost to the prop
erty owners of fitting up their frontages
on the avenue would be from $150 to 1200 a
front foot. President Raphael said It
had cost his firm J175 a foot, the work
being: done In first-class style.
I. Friedman, representing the furniture
store of M. Friedman & Co., on Post
street, said his people would object to the
Improvement, as they needed the avenue
for , draying purposes. They were , in
favor of beautifying the city, but dld'not
feel justified In Impairing their business
to aid the project In hand. ,
Newton J. Tharp, the architect, submit
ted the estimate of cost as $35,000
for the one block for the arcaSe
of plasp, supported by ornamental
Iron pillars and for sewerage. President
Raphael said it had been thought the
work would cost much more. The assess
ment under this total would be $109 a
front foot.
James D. Phelan, speaking for the As
sociation for the Adornment of San
Francisco, said the arcade on the ave
nue would add much to the beauty of the
retail district. He spoke of the attrac
tiveness of arcades In Old World cities.
Mr. Raphael said the proposition to
make an arcade of. the two blocks was
meeting with great favor. It was almost
certain that Â£.11 the owners and lease
holders In the first block would sign
agreements, but there was a minority op
position in the second block, that be
tween Grant avenue and Stockton street,
that might make the carrying out of the
scheme there impossible. -A majority of
all the leaseholders! and property owners
was favorable, he satd.

tilication of Union Square avenue held a

Kuve the play last week, scoring a bis
hit. They have been rehearsing for the
play for several weeks and it is on ac
count of the production that the little
ones \u25a0will lose a week's vacation. But
they have entered into the spirit of the
thins and all consented to give up their
holidays in order to appear at the
benefit. The rehearsals are being con
ducted under the supervision of the
young lady students and ' teachers of
the Normal School. Tickets for the
benefit are for sale at Sherman, Clay &

cents. .
Th*Â» pupils of the elementary class of
the San Francisco Normal School will .

At present the number of vines grown
in the vicinity of Roseville is small, but
the tests of the Government experts show
that the climatic conditions are so fa
vorabla that the vines will bear early and
that the grapes will ripen evenly. The
land is high and composed of a decom
posed granite soil requiring- no irrigation.
The analysis of the grapes shows them
to abound in sugar/the quantity of sac
charine matter frequently running as
high as 32 per cent.
The company, with offices in San Fran
cisco, has secured flf teen-year contracts
with a large number of land owners to
furnish grapes for^the project. The. price
to be paid will be a special inducement
for the growers to plant, for the crops
are known jto be substantial. I The 'com
pany estimates the increase in acreage
will be 2000 acres a year and as the in
crease comes they will enlarge their plant
to keep pace with the production; â¢
Several years ago the United States
Government Wine Commission 7 made an
examination of the different producing
sections and reported .the area along the
Sierras as. a favored spot for grape cul
ture. The reports "show that the grapes
grown In the Sierra district' wiir make 160
gallons of Burgundy :. to I the ton.
With the establishment of the Placer
County Winery Company at Roseville a
big: stride In development of California
has been taken and a new field will be
opened which will do much to Increase
the ' State's recognition among the vitM
culturists of the world. Acting under the
advice of J the Government experts, who
have made a study of the soil conCTilons,
this land on the southwestern slope \u25a0;â¢ of
the lower Sierras was chosen and-pro
nounced better for wine grapes than even
the famed land along the Rhine.
The buildings and press erected for the
winery cost $100,000 and are capable of an
output of 1,500,000 gallons a , year. . The
pllnt is equipped with j> a capacity of
handling- 8000 tons of grapes annually and
converting them into wine. Huge cellars
will be built for the storing and aging of
the product.

Those who have not been Tivoli-.
ward lately will do well to; wander up
there this week, to take-in "The Black
Hussar," revived with * signal success
last : night I The revival of. the opera
saw also thie : reappearance .-o f -'Barron
Berthald, who comes from grand-opera
regions to : adorn the tenor role through"
the Tivoli comic-opera season. .Both
were welcomed in right Tivoli fashion,
but an audience much too small did the
work.; That can be only a .matter, of 'a
night or two, however. v for 'every audi
tor will be an advertiser. -
One can easily understand the present
vogue' in Germany and otherwheres
European of "The Black Hussar. 1 ' The
opera is tuneful and musically.attract
ive throughout. There. is story with a
sparkling; martial; flavor that inever
gets lost. ':. There are effective ;charac
ters, handsome pictures and. plenty of
fun and' frolic. In Jthe Tivoli edition
the opera might have been made yes
terday. Probably if it had,' though, its
soldiery would have been not French,
but Japanese that conquered its Rus
sians. But the opera is throughout
smart and up-to-date, while having the
best characteristics of the older: school.
It loses nothing in the Tivoli: produc
tion. Beginning with Mr. Berthald and
ending with a chorus that reastonishes
every, time it is heard, the" people are
almost throughout excellent. The ; set
tings and costumes are unusually, elab
orate, and there was last night, a first
performance that positively shone.
: Mr.' Berthald has the role ' of the
Black Hussar, and, though, perhaps not
excessively* martial, the singer fills in
the part picturesquely enough. It* is
remarkable. how Mr. Berthald keeps the
smoothness of his voiced so absolutely
intact from year to year; at least it
would be remarkable if he did not so
well know how to use it. Sweet, strong
and smooth as ever it ; is, i and .if . the (
singer would only condescend; to sing'
less as Frank, Worthing sometimes
talks, you would ask no more. But it
is really seldom that one can under
stand him. He seems, too, to have left
his English here last year, for he has
rather forgotten how 'to use it. A day
or two will, -r. of. course, '_ make that
straight, : and meantime, if 'you could,
Mr. Berthald, throw a word or two to
us in -the songs, and make the best
comic-opera tenor that we know â ex
cept Dippel!â a little better?;
Schuster has a part that fits him as
never was in that of Hackenbach, the
turncoat , magistrate. . He surprises
afresh with that great, round, .warm
basso ' of . his. , It seems better every
time one hears it, and last night he
acted as well as he sang. Berthald,
Teddy Webb and Schuster have ; a trio
that; alone: is worth going to hear, and
'each has pood songs, though the; con-,
eerted music is much more interesting.
Teddy Webb Is useful, as always; Mel
vin Stokes is good as a French' officer,
and Charles A: Morgan, in a specialty
as" a heavy "tragedian '"that /belongs
more to the Orpheum, convulsed the
Tivoli ''last' night. ', ;
Miss Palotta and Miss Hemmi, helped
the picture and . the \u25a0' music along,- and
Aimee Leicester excelled herself, as a
serving- maid.jv "The Black Hussar"
should be heard, and seen.

Jk. WORKING BRAIX
Can Be Mndr Â£urccÂ«feful on Rlffht Food.
A busy man in one of America's largest
watch factories tells bow by change of
food he gained a clear brain and steady
nerves and averted a mental and physical
breakdown. He Bays:
"1 was accustomed all my life to
the ordinary diet of the average table. I
thought that meat, potatoes and other
vegetables and fruit were necessary, and
that tea. coffee and pastry In moderate
quantities were not injurious.
".out I found, in course of time, that
\u25a0 my dietary was affecting my health seri-
ously. For four years I continued to run
down. In time my nerves became seri-
ously affected, they seemed constantly
keyed up to the highest tension, and I
became subject to the most violent bilious
attacks, which used to leave me in a weak
and nervous condition for several days.
The climax seemed to have been reached
a few years ago, when I found myself
about as near a physical wreck as a man
I could well be and live. Pnysicians, ton-
ics and other medicines, visits -to the
country, etc., etc, were of no avail.
"In sheer desperation I concluded, a
few months ago, to see wnat effect a diet
of Grape-Nuts food would have. J had
. often heard of it, but had little hope it
would help me. I at once cut out all the
heavy aishes with the tea and coffee that
I had always used and -began to eat
Grape-Nuts with cream end a pinch of
salt. Afterward I addedrrult, with oc-
casionally an egg beaten up In milk, and
c entire wheat bread. This has been prac-
tically my diet for more than two months.
"I found that' with the new diet- I
gained complete relief almost immediate-
ly from all the distress that used to fol-
low every meal; my bilious condition was
speedily regulated and cured; my nerves
have grown healthy and steadyâ ln short
my run-down constitution has t been re-
constructed and built up. As to the ef-
fect upon my mental powers I have only
"to point to the f act. that^ l have recently
been, placed in a responsible position in
our establishment where complete con-
centration of mind is required to deal
with complicated records and reports,
and that I bave been enabled to keep
my accounts- absolutely correct, which
my * numerous predecessors uniformly
failed to do.
"I think these things speak volumes in
favor of Grape-Nuts food as a nerve and
brain builder. I ascribe all my improve-
ment, mental and physical, the. fact that
I am possessed of steadier nerves, a
clearer brain, a fine appetite, and have
gained healthily in weight, to the cutting:
out of heavy food and the systematic
uee of Grape-Nuts food." Name : gives

H. J. Sadler and Minnie Sadler must
pay a trifle more than $2000 to the de
funct People's Home Savings Bank ac
cording to decision rendered by, the
Supreme Court yesterday. The Sadlera
bought several shares of stock in the
"Vinegar Bitters" institution, paying
one-third of the price down. When the
bank closed the receiver wanted the
Sadlers to pay their other two-thirds
subscription. The fact that they felt
some slight reluctance at the idea of
paying for "dead' horse" is demon
strated by the legal flght they have
made.

dent King: of Oberlln University will
speak.
The Baptist ministers will go in a
body to Mount Tamalpals for a recrea
tion Jaunt next Monday morning:, leav
ing the city at 8:10 o'clock.
In speaking of the hard -work of the
clergy yesterday a member of the
Methodist body gave some figures of
the travels of some of their members.
He showed tnat the Rev. Dr. George B.
Smyth had covered 10,484 miles on the
coast for the Missionary Society in the
last nine months.
"Phases of Temperance" was the
subject discussed by the Rev. James A.
Chamberlain of Sacramento before tho
Congregational Ministers' Union yes
terday. Rev. Mr. Chamberlain said he
would place three propositions before
voters: First. "No license"; second, "A
limited license," and, third, "An unlim
ited license." Then, he said, they could
get at the conscientious sentiment of
the people.
Rev. Mr. "Whitaker was of. opinion
that a minister should consider himself
the minister of the community rather
than one of his own people, and he
should minister without consideration
of church lines.
PHASES OF TEMPERWCE.
As a remedy he suggested closer ac
quaintance between both ministers and
members of churches of different de
nominations.
The Rev. Mr. Whitaker discussed the
waste of money of the church in effort
and influence due, an unholy denomina
tional rivalism which was impoverish
ing in Its effect, especially in rural
church life.
â¢'Interdenominational Fellowship" was
the theme of an interesting address
by the Rev. Robert Whitaker at the
Baptist Ministers' Association meeting
held yesterday in the Y. M. C. A. building:.
"Mohammed and His Religion," was
the subject of an address before the
Methodist Ministers' Union at Central
Methodist Episcopal Church, Mission
etreet. yesterday. I>r. Joseph Koshaba
gave the history and traditions cluster
ing around the birth ana life of Mo
hammed. His telling of Mohammed's
polygamous practice brought out a dis
cussion in which It was said that there
was a unit of the doctrine of his polyga
mous eystem with Mormonism.
It was held that Mohammedism was
closely akin to Christian Science in that
It was a religion of desire.
A large number of the Methodist
Episcopal denomination are attending
the camp meeting' at Beulah Park, East
Oakland. There are three sermons a
day, independently of numerous prayer
services. -V.---
LIFE OF MOHAMMED.
He felt convinced that they could go
into the evangelistic work on the Pa
cific Coast and push It as never before.
The Rev. Dr. John A. Marquis, who was
& delegate to the assembly, told of the
evangelistic spirit that pervaded the
meetings, so much 60 that he considered
It an evangelistic assembly. He ex
pressed his happy surprise at the won
derful and vigorous growth of the church
in the East during the last three years.
60 ardent were the people that the ad
vance of the church became a matter of
deep comment among men even on the
streets of the cities.
President John Samuel Macintosh, IX
J>., of the San Francisco Theological Sem
inary addressed a meeting of the Pres
byterian Ministers' Union yesterday at
920 Sacramento street on the labors of
the recent gathering of the General As
sembly at Wlnona.'
President Macintosh told of the remark
able gathering of men of different walks
of life taking pan In the deliberations.
There were foremost educators, divines,
members of the bar and commercial men
of the highest standing In the land.
He isald that the Presbyterian Assembly
had made every possible preparation for
the completion of the union with the
Cumberland church and that it remained
with the Cumberland body to adjust Its
Internal affairs In order to complete the
union.
Speaking of religious work In the uni
versity President Macintosh thought that
the church might be able to Influence
students more In the Interest of religion.
-There waa the open door, ne said, and
they had not taken proper advantage
of It.
The rights of deserted and otherwise
mistreated wives la gone Into In detail
by Judge Graham In his opinion overrul
ing: Collins' demurrer and he finds that
not only law but equity reaches out to
protect the gentler ccx. ,
Attorney George D. Collins is now face
to fact with the issue he has evaded
recourse to legal technicalities
since. the day a charge of bigamy was
laid against him by the woman that
claims to be his first and only legal wife,
Charlotte. E. Collins. Judge Graham of
the Superior Court has overruled .his
demurrer to Mrs. Collins' complaint for
maintenance and ordered that he answer
within ten days her charge that he has
abandoned and refused to support her.
There Is now no escape for Collins and
If he would avoid judgment against him
there is but one thing to do â set forth in
detail and prove his contention that she
Is not his wife. In his answer he may
choose to enter a general denial to her
allegations, but in any event the trial
will his defense and, as Judge
Graham is zealous In his support of the
Interests of deserted wives, Collins will
enjoy but a short respite before facing
the" ordeal of trial.

The board awarded the contract for the
burial of ! the indigent . dead to Joseph
Keily at $7 for "-each interment, for- a
period of four months until the city can
arrange. to do the work on its own ac
count. * \u25a0 - .
Nicholas - Brennan was appointed ste
nographer of the board at a salary of
$125 per month. Supervisor Hocks ex
pressed his indignation that he had not
been consulted by his Democratic asso
ciates before the appointment was made.
; The clerk was directed to file with the
Auditor the ordinance fixing ;the.. budget
of. municipal expenditures for 'the ' fiscal
year 1905-1906. ,-:.,.
"It was announced that the Public/Util
ities Committee would meet next Friday
at 3 p.- m. to take up "the petition of
the Home Telephone Company for a fran
chise to operate a telephone system. â¢
The, Board of Works requested the
Finance Committee -to keep intact the
funds for the paving of Fourth street, the
paving of H street; ' Fulton" street, from
Twenty-fifth, to. Thirty-fifth avenues,
Holly Park, Buena Vista avenues and 'the
streets j around Alamo ' square ; parking . of
Dolores street, " ! the building- of, the Cliff
House parapet; as the work cannot be
undertaken until after the end' of this
fiscal year. The committee agreed to the
proposition and directed the clerk to "pre
pare the' necessary resolution.
Braunhart thought the money .. should
be returned to Mozetti despite the fact
that- he was a confessed 'briber, 'which
subject, he- said, should, be â¢ one .for : _.' ; the
Grand Jury to- investigate; as it is an of
fense against the laws of -the State. '
The Board of Supervisors yesterday
granted the petition of *B. Mozetti. a
dairyman, for the refund of $315 which he
paid to ; the^ pbundmen for the release of
105' cows impounded ,for being at large.
The joint i committee yon ;'Police and
; Finance had reported against , the refund
because Mozetti had testified at the in
vestigation ihat he had . paid Deputy.
Poundmaster G. Edwards $15 a week for
three weeks and $15 to Superintendent A.
L. linger for the privilege of allowing
his cows to graze at large.
Boxton held that Mozettf u- was . entitled
to ' the returns of < the monfy because it
was proven that \u25a0 his j corral had ' been
broken through accident or, design and
his cows had escaped. Brandenstein said
the committee; had reported against ; the
refunding? of the â¢ money" to Mozetti | be
cause he had confessed that he had
bribed the pound deputies .to secure im
munity from their raifls.^ 2 \u25a0
"The pound is only conducted for" a
grafting purpose," said Rea, "and not
for the protection of the people. ' The
evidence shows conclusively, that Mozet
ti's fence was broken j down and it looks
peculiar that the poundmen" on" previous,
occasions always arrived too late to im
pound his cows. The, pound is now either
Jn incompetent hands or. its managers are
derelict in their duty. ".

INDIANS KILL WHALE OFF CAPE FLATTERY
ATTACH BLADDERS TO HARPOONS AND LEVIATHAN IS^UNABLE TO DIVE
Three-score Siwashes in a fleet of
canoes attacked and killed a whale a,
few days ago off Cape Flattery, and, ,
according to the officers of the Sorvre
g*ian steamer Tricolor, the red men in
the vicinity of Neah Bay have heen liv
ing high on blubber ever since. The
whale had been seen off the o<ipe for
several days, and the expedition to
which the big tish surrendered was or
granlzed'aud equipped specially for the
chase and capture of the leviathan.
Every canoe curried a dozen harpoozis
and to each harpoon was attached a
tight-blown bladder. Every time a:
canoe approached sufficiently near a
harpoon was thrown into the while's i
tough hide. When the Victoria tug
l^orne came upon the scene the whale I
had been "hit" many times and resem
bled a monster hedgehog. In addition
to the annoyance caused by the forest
of steel shafts there were so many |
bladders moored to his carcass that,
try as he would, he could not sink, and
so find at least temporary refuge from
his tormentors. When the Indians had
assured themselves of the buoyancy of
their prey they threw in a few more 1
harpoons with lines attached and at- i
i.mpted to herd the whale into Xeah '
Hay. at the same time using him as a I
towboat for the fleet. But the big fish
\\3S too far gone to be much use in
iiarness, so. with a few bombs, the Si- â¢
washes torpedoed the monster to death
.- nd hired a tugboat to tow the carcass
into Xeah Bay. They beached the re
mains and are still serving free blub
ber to all comers.

Dairy Exchange, and the matter Is said to be
assuming ' shape. -. â¢ '
-The Butter market -opened the weak very
dull, with a general feeling of \u25a0 weakness.
While the top quotation for fine creameries
still ruled, some.' houses were ' letting go at
19c \u25a0 to work oft their stocks. s The feeling was
bearish all . over the street and the' .tendency
was rather i downward. :
Chees* was stiH quoted weak by most
houses, though the - quotations remained un
changed. Stocks seem to be gradually in-'
creasing. \u25a0 ' â¢ - \u25a0 \u25a0 \u25a0 ' .
-: There was not much Change in Eggs, but
they- shared : the general . dullness and weak
ness, with receipts large and stocks too heavy,
for \u25a0" the slack demand to absorb." '. /
Receipts were 49,300 lbs Butter, 1743 cases
Eggs and 47,300 lbs Cheese.

The fruit market was heavily supplied with
seasonal . deciduous varieties, \u25a0 and, aside from
a fair, demand' for ; choice, suitably packed of
ferings for export to Puget Sound points, trade
was quiet and the general tone of the market
was one -of weakness. Small * packages Of
Apricots."' Pears. Peaches . and ordinary . Plums
and Prune* .were still In oversupply and, , aa
usual, large lines of those descriptions had to
be held . over. - Some choice Burbank â¢ Plums
sold for ' shipping \u25a0 at 75c \ per - crate " and fine
Stmoni Prunes were taken for the same pur
pose at 85Â®00c. StflQtly fancy Apples, packed
in \u25a0 4-tler : boxes, \u25a0: were - firm at < $1 50 per box,
while ' the- lower i grades - were â¢ plentiful and
weak at low. prices. Currants and Gooseberries
were steady./ while - Figs were plentiful , and
rather weak. " Cherries were .-In limited sup
ply, but sold slowly, offerings being mostly of
poor quality.;; Loose Apricots were slow sellers,
particularly .those from the .river, most, of
which were , spotted' from fungus. .The cannera
took small' quantities at $10Wl5 per ton,' while
the regular trade paid as high as. lo. per pound
for choice lots. Berries were quiet and weak,
there being over 1000 chests of all varieties re. .
eeived.' K Melons ' were â¢ closely cleaned up, . but
three f carloads t were reported on 1 the ; way and
near at hand. ; The Orange i market was In good

There is about one-sixth ; of \u25a0 the usual amount
on hand In other years at ; this" season. After
a carer ul canvass of the expected crop Ct 1005
now J growing ' on *.; the trees i it : has developed
that there, is about 42 per cent of last year's
crop. -As last v year's crop : was; only from sev
enty to ninety, million pounds (our normal crop
Is f estimated at one hundred million, pounds),
there ' can \u25a0 be 'only l about thirty-six, million
pounds of this year's crop (1905).
' "At'a meeting of the growers'who hold 1904
Prunes on hand it was dÂ«-'dÂ«d that they would
hold for, a- 2V5c b*sis" for 1904 fruit and a 3e
basis for 1005 fruit, and that no change would
be made in these prices up to 9eotembÂ«r . 1; :
this to be for good fruit in bags. It is likely
that the price will ' rise above these figures."

N I3 W- tork.* June -Â».â T&e price-movement
on thÂ« .^tock Exchange to-day followed the
rule- recently prevalent of reversing the di
re.-ticn of the day before. Saturday's move
ment was downward *uid to-day the slow and
ura?Rir.g movement was upward. The volume
of dealings roÂ»Â« slightly over those for either
Thursday or Friday of last week, j There was
no evidence of real life in the market and the
I \u25a0rofesswcnai contingent did not venture to in
dulge a hope that a progressive expansion in
activity was in progress. The tone of the
market, â¢ however, was called good and the
iaet that the occasional tentative operations
on the part of traders are on the buying: side
helps to .confirm confidence In the stability
at values. -.Such tentative operations to-day
<lid not. extend beyond a handful of favorite
speculative stocks.. A number of these were
uniitr the intiuence of reiterated predictions of
a coaine increase In the distribution for
Heading. That stock itself was one- of the
more active issues and the movement In Penn
sylvania wa< distinctly in sympathy. 'Union
l'ae.nc casne In for its share of the move
ment and the strength of United States SteeJ
I>retc-iTf d was of sympathetic benefit to the
whole list. â¢ The expectation of an early re
ivcrt from the State Superintendent Of Insur-.
ancc on the Equitable Life investigation was
maoe the basis lor some professed hopes of,
an early clearing up of the speculative situa
tion. But it was announced during the day
that this i* anxiously awaited report might
not be published for several days. The hitch
which was threatened last week In the peace
lifg-ctiations was reported to be cleared up
to-o'ay and relations seemed to be Improved
)it ween Germany and France. The market
wa* thus relieved, from depression on those
accounts. Incoming reports of gross earn
ings of railroads for the second week In June
showed the level well maintained above last
year In accordance with the recent tendency.
Railroad traffic officials also spoke In an
\u2666 ncouraglTig vein of the traffic offered and of
the premise for the future, based on the good
crop prosx>ects. The wavering movement oper
ating in the market from hour to hour made
It difficult to make predictions on the . crop
situation, but weather conditions were . re
ported promising. The large Increase In loans
â¢shown by the Saturday bank statement came
in for discussion and the suggestion was of
fered that It represented the replacing of the
proceeds of the Japanese loan subscription
which was shifted and redeposlted a week be
fore The money market continued entirely
unrurned. although preparations are making
for -the coming half yearly settlements. A
transfer by telegraph . from San Francisco
through the sub-Treasury of *Â«*O.OOO was an
Incident of the flay. The closing was made
somtwhat lregular by slight profit-taking In
railroad etocks. â¢
Bonds were Irregular. Total sales, par value,
$3,<)50.000.

NEW YORK. June 19.â The irregularity
which the cotton market developed to-day was
due to the sentiment on the immediate future
course of prices, and the present crop outlqok
which exists among . the generality of ' opera
tors. The strength abroad, together with an
other dry hot weather map, started our mar
ket strong and- active, with an advance. -of
about ten points from Saturday's j closing
Heavy selling by local and New. Orleans bulls
soon sent the market oft. This was followed by
a sharp rally on a fresh buying movement
which carried the market up again 10 to 12
points over Saturday's closing, with October
again selling at B.Boc and December at Oc v

that â¢' clear â¢ weather \u25a0 had : prevailed generally

however; soon \u25a0 became ' more /bearish than be
fore.*and'prices started on another ' downward
movement. \u25a0-\u25a0\u25a0 The cause of the â¢ renewed .' weak
ness . was the unanimity -of - advices \u25a0 from the
harvest fields regarding the unexpectedly large
yields. \u25a0\u25a0 One report' claimed that the total crop
for, Western Kansas would be 15,000,000 bushels
in excess of. the yield a year ago.r. Another de
pressing Influence was . a;; decline In . wheat

thÂ» lowest point of the. day. The market
closed, weak w.'th July at 87%Â®S8c. - v.,

tioneer. * \u25a0 . "Ah Fat. told a different story of the
tripe Incident, and-what led to it. Mr.
Voann . acted both ' arrogantly and 'un
reasonably,* Ah ' Fat averred, by casting
aspersion upon the Quality of the pork
chops , there -displayed -t or sale.;.and of
which he' (Ah; Fat- made a â¢\u25a0 specialty.
Why didn't Mr. Voann do as other Cau-
Paul.Voann asseverated that it was not
with deliberate Intent to create, disor
der, but to purchase pork chops, that
he visited the Chinese butcher shop at
Pacific and Dupont streets, nor was his
behavior there primarly responsible for
the peace disturbance complained of by
Ah Fat. . Indeed .he 'accepted without
show- of ' resentment ,'more" oral abuse
from Ah: pat than most white persons
would have supinely submitted to, and
his eventual smiting. of Ah 'Fat's, face
with the undressed tripe , might be lik
ened unto the turning of the worm.
Not until his patience was worn to "a
frazzle by Ah -Fat's vitriolic harangue
did he snatch the tripe from the bucket
and swing it against his traducer's
countenance. .'. .....'
Andrew Judge, a former pugilist,

COMPLAINT BEARS FRUIT.
\u25a0 Merchants .of â¢ San Francisco repre
sent to Governor Pardee that they can
not obtain fair recognition la dealing
with the Board of Managers ( ot the
\apa State Hospital^ . The same repre
sentation is made to Secretary of State
Curry, and Attorney General Webb. The
complaints of unfair a treatment-: come
from the San. Francisco Supply
ciation, \u25a0 the officers of which ore:
President, A. A. Wat kin 9 of W.. \V.
Jlontagxie Â£c Co.) vice president, H. T.
Laity, Crane Company; treasurer, Grove
P. Ayer, Hotbrook, Merrill & Stetson,
and Secretary Eugene Goodman. These
officers, together with Andrew- Dulziel
of Dalziel & Molltr, compose the execu
tive committee of the association.
The secretary has addressed the fol
lowing communication to the Napa
board, and Inclosed a copy of the same
to each member of the State Board of
Examiners:
SAN FRANCISCO. June 14, 1905.
To the President and Board of Managers,
Napa State Hospital, Kapa, Cal. â Dear Sirs:
Referring to the request recently Issued for
bids for furnishing plumbing supplies for the
Napa State Hospital for the Insane during
the ensuing fiscal year beg to advise you on
behalf of the wholesale houses of San Fran
cisco carrying plumbing supplies that they
respectfully decline to submit bids for furnish
ing these supplies owing to the lack of fair
treatment accorded them.
In explanation .of the position assumed by
the local bouses would state that the plumb
ing goods specified for use are such as are
not carried by any of the wholesale houses in
California, and In addition thereto there Is no
alternative given blddtrs of furnishing sim
ilar goods of equally good quality produced by
other manufacturers. In all fairness an op
portunity should be given the San Francisco
wholesale houses, who are large taxpayers,
to bid on supplies such as they carry in stock,
and which are of equal if not better quality
ot manufacture than those arbitrarily specified
in the called for bids.
The local houses likewise protest .against
the methods employed in opening bids fOr
awarding contracts. It is the custom of all
Federal and municipal officers to open all bids
In the presence of such bidders as may de
sire to be present and to place specifications
In the hands of all merchants three weeks to
a month in advance of the opening, which Is
advertised to take place on a specified day
and hour. This method gives the widest pub
licity to all the facts surrounding the awards
and places all bidders on the same footing,
and contrasts strongly with the methods here
tofore adopted In making awards for the Napa
Hospital.
STAKTLIXG CHARGES.
The writer then makes the following
startling charges regarding^ the cor
rupt handling of bids:
"I am fully Justified In going further
and statins that It la known to some of
the local houses that specifications for
plumbing- supplies have been In the
possession of some bidders for . a long
time, in fact, the plumbing goods called
for In the specifications have actually
been purchased in the East and are at
present in San Francisco, with the
knowledge, loag before the bids are
called for, that the award Trill be made
to the party irho has already purchased
the goods.
"It Is also known that this same bid
der has been awarded contracts to fur
nish articles of a certain quality and
manufacture for the A'apa Hospital and
has substituted therefor articles of an
other grade and different manufacture.
I would also like to point out the fact
that through the permission granted
this same bidder to use day labor . in
the performance of the necessary
plumbing: work, the local - wholesale
houses are placed at a further disad
vantage."
The letter concludes with the fol
lowing direct statements:.
Another feature of the manner In which
supplies are purchased, which I would . like
to point out, is the call' for lump sum bids.
This method is detrimental to the best in
terests of the State, as In case certain of the
articles called for are found not to be actually
required the State must necessarily purchase
and pay for < the same, while If all bids were
required to be Itemized the articles not actually
required need not be ordered. It will thus
be apparent to you that . the State is not
The decision is a substantial victory for
the City Attorney and his assistant, John
P. Coghlan. who represented him at the
trial, as it fully upholds the appraise
ment for which they have contended from
the beginning. Coghlan made a motion
to set several other eases for trial,
among them being the suit against the
Â£an Francisco Land Company, which
owns part of three blocks, which, next
to Benson. Is the largest owner in the
tract to be acquired. The Judge set that
ease for triaÂ» on July 10.
When the city takes possession of the
block owned by Benson it will own nearly
half of the proposed extension. It has
already purchased without litigation the
whols of the block between A street and
Point Lobos avenue, and from one to a
dozen lots in each of the other blocks.
The first of the condemnation suits
brought by the city to acquire land for
parks, schools, a new library and other
public purposes, voted for in the recent
bond issue, was decided yesterday by
Judg* Lawlor. It was the case of the
city and county against John Benson and
the Judgment was a victory for the mu
nicipality, the Judge upholding the offi
cial appraisement.
Benson owned block 194, which lies be
tween Point Lobos avenue and Clement
etreet in the line of the proposed exten
sion of Golden Gate Park northward be
tween Thirteenth and Fourteenth avenues
to the Presidio Military Reservation. He
placed its value at $60,000. The city of
fered to pay him 547,750 and on his refus
ing to accept that sum brought suit to
condemn the block. At the trial about
three weeks ago witnesses gave testi
mony that the block was worth from
$37,500 to $40,000 undivided, and from
$47,000 to $45,000 if divided into lots.
In deciding the case yesterday the
Judge said be considered $48,000 the very
highest figure that could be placed on
the "block. He said he had before him
the testimony of the best real estate ex
perts In the city and from their evi
dence he was free to say that he thought
$45,000 the maximum value of the block.
He thought the city had been more than
fair In presenting its evidence so as to
determine fairly and honestly the value
of the land.
