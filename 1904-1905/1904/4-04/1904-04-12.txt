The contention that the case involved
proprietary interests of the State was
not allowed to influence the opinion.
On that point the court said in part:
- "The Injury on account of which the
present suit was brought is at most
only remote and indirect; such an In
jury a3 would come alike, although In
different degrees, to every individual
owner of property in a State by reason
of the supprecation, in violation of. the
cct of Congress, of free competition be
tween Interstate carriers engaged .in
but inecs In such State. If Minnesota
may by an, original suit in -its name
Invoke the Jurisdiction, of the Circuit
Court because . alone of "the alleged ; re
mote and Indirect injury to its pro
prietary interests arising from the mere
absence of free competition in trade and
"It is," he said, "not a criminal pro
ceeding, nor a suit in equity. In the
name of the United States, to restrain
violations of the anti-trust" act, nor -a
proceedlngr in the name of the United
States for the forfeiture of property,
nor an action by any person or cor
poration for the recovery of threefold
damages for injury done to business
or property- by some other person or
corporation."
Justice Harlan called attention to the
fact that the proceeding was for the
purpose of enforcing both the State
laws and the Federal anti-trust act,
saying that the Circuit Court could not
have taken jurisdiction If only the State
statutes had been Involved. Taking up
the Federal law and analyzing Its pro
visions, he said it was clear that the
case did not belong to any of the classes
provided for by it.
In delivering the opinion of the court
Justice Harlan cited the facts bearing
upon . the . origin and j history, of . the
case, saying that originally the suit
was instituted by the State in its own
court, but that before an opinion could
be reached there it was on petition of
th* Securities Company transferred to
the. Circuit Court for the District of
Minnesota, by which court It was dis
missed. Much controversy arose over
the right to remove to the Federal
court, and after hearing the- case ar
gued once the Supreme Court ordered
a second -hearing on that point. .
WASHINGTON, April 11.â The Unlt
j ed States Supreme Courty to-day de
cided the case cf the State of Mfnne
i sota vs. the Northern Securities Com
â¢pany and the Northern Pacitic
Great Northern companies, involving
the validity of the merger of the two
railroad companies/holding that it was
without Jurisdiction and reversing the
opinion of the court below. Justice
j Harlan, who delivered the opinion, said
that the Circuit Court should not have
I entertained Jurisdiction in the case, the
effect being to remand tne case to the
1 State courts. â¢ . .
"For 'the! reasons stated we are of
the opinion that the suit does not â to
use .the. words of the act of 1875 â really
and: substantially involve a dispute or
controversy -within, the jurisdiction o f .
the Circuit Court for the purpose of a
final decree., That Jbeingr the case the.
Circuit Court, following the mandate of
the statute, should not have proceeded
therein, but should have remanded the
case to the State court.

reversed and the case Is sent back with
directions' that It be remanded to the

-The opinion of the court was unani

He said In conclusion:
The court also refused to hold that

would be affected under article IV of
the Federal constitution by permittjnÂ£

This was foreseen by the " Japanese,

The Supreme Court decision In the
case of Minnesota against the merger
is considered by the State's legal offi
cer*, as a virtual victory, for. th* State,
eJ though It puts the litigation back
Ulihu Root, former Secretary- of War.
arrive d here to-day to take up his work
!n connection with- the case to be
argued before the United States Court
to-morrow as to whether the petition
on the part of the Harriman interests
for leave to Intervene in the settlement
of the Northern Securities Company's
affairs shall be denied or granted.
The first question for consideration
will be whether Harriman and Pierce
will be permitted to file their petition.
If that is decided in "the affirmative,
further proceedings In' the regular
order may be had. If It Is denied, it
probably will end the proceedings, and
the suit of the United States vs. the
Northern Securities Company will
stand as it did before the motion for
leare to Intervene was filed.
"Something else to throw a little
light on the situation: When the
Northern Securities Company was
beinp formed Harriman came to
me and offered me power of at
torney for ten years if I would
take in the Harriman lines. I
told him I didn't want tbem. He urged
me to consider the proposition, which
would pive us control of the railway
situation from the Mississippi to the
Gulf of Mexico on the south, the Pa
cific on the west and the International
boundary* on the north. I told Harri
man 1 was working for the develop
ment of the northwest and would not
and could not work in the interests of
both sections. Every morning for* a
week he renewed the proposition. We
didn't accept it.
- "This plan will accomplish what was
tought then, in throwing the big lines
of the Wrst under common control."
ICLJTJU ROOT IS COCXSEI*.
"Take thp directorates of the St. Paul
and Chicago lines and you can easily
see the common interest running
through the systems I have named.
Under this scheme I am telling you
about the St." Paul would acquire the
8t. Paul-Duluth line of the Northern
Pacific and the Northwestern the St.
Paul-Duluth line of the Great North
ern. The entire northern trans-eonti
ncntal field would be absolutely wfthin
the grasp of these two systems, and the
Union Pacific would strengthen its po
sition on the south with the Burling
ton. r :'ii"
the Union Pacific taking the Burling
ton, the St. Paul taking- the Northern
Pacific acd the Northwestern taking
the Great Northern. Such a statement,
ccming from President Hill, has caused
a sensation and is of the greatest tig
niHcauce. Hill said: â¢'â¢â¢Â¦*-â¢'' Â¦ A
"It Isn't the Northern Pacific alone
that is concerned. Control of that line
is part of a plan under which the pur
pose is to shut off the Great Northern
i n the south and north, leaving it in
such a' position that it will have to seli
out. I have no doubt that now I could
t emmand almost any price for Great
Northern, up to 250 perhaps.
"The scheme of division is simply
this, that the Union Pacific wants the
Burlington, the -St. Paul is aiming to
take over the Northern Pacific and the
Northwestern, if the petition succeeds,
Â¦will take its chance of getting -the
Great Northern. If the Harriman suit
wins I have already said the Great
Northern will sell out. We will retire
from the struggle and leave the North
vest to fisrht its own battles.
INTERESTS IN COMMON.
O'Urt was a sharply defined plan to
'"bottle up" the Great Northern, force
its saJe and divide the northern trans
Â«Â«.ntinental lines between new interests.
Harriman's grievance against the
President is similarly grounded to that
of J. Pierpont Morgan and James J.
HilL They all felt* hurt at the action
of the President in directing the At
torney General to proceed against the
Northern Securities Company. Morgan
has become reconciled to^the ejection
of Roosevelt and i HilL jj is v supporting

BOISE, Idaho, April 11.â The State
Board o"f Pardons to-night commuted
the sentence of George Levy to life
imprisonment. He was to have been
hanged on Friday for the murder of
David Levy in October, 1891.
The feature of the application for
clemency was a showing indicating that
another man may have committed the
deed. Soon after Levy was murdered
the Public Administrator received
through the mail what purported to
be a will left by him. The principal
beneficiary under this will was Harry
Watkins. It is claimed on investiga
tion, as demonstrated, that the docu
ment was written on a typewriter in
the possession of Watkins; also that
he had Levy's signature on a slip of
paper in his desk. The latter fact was
testified to before the board by men
who had been in "Watkins' employ. The
murdered man was an old miner and
was quite wealthy.
Watkins was Indebted to him at the
time of his death. George Levy was
not a relative of the murdered man.
He was a Frenchman who rented prop
erty from the old man.

When the case of Edward Richards,
charged with, murder, was called for
trial in Judge Lawlor's court yester
day morning Attorney Shepardson. for
the defendant, challenged the panel
and argued that Judges had no legal
authority to make, prepare, propose
or certify a list of jurors, and that
in so doing they were violating the
t onstitution. Tho Judge, after consid
erable argument, disallowed the chal
lenge and the work of impaneling the
jury was proceeded with.
Richards is accused of having shot
and killed Joseph Martini at 623 Pa
cific street on the morning of January
<>. Rich;irds came from Visalia and
after spending several hours on the
Harbary Coast went to Martini's sa
loon with a woman. They drank two
bottles of brer and during a dispute
whout settlement Richards shot and
killed Martini. There seemed to be no
extenuating circumstances.

NEVADA, Mo.. April 11. â Edward
Griffith, son of the postmaster of Great
Bend. Ivans., haj< been arrested here,
charged with having stolen a regis
tered package of $5000. which was
tent by the Traders' Bank of Kansas
City to a banking house at Great Bend
on February 9. GrifiSth confessed.
Griffith was once an employe of the
Great Bend postofflce and had access
to the registered packages. After tak
ing the 55000 he fled to El Paso. Tex.
A letter in the Nevada postoffice ad
dressed to "Ed Graham." known as
Griffith's alias, led to his arrest. An
inspector went to El Paso and trailed
Griffith to Carthage, Mo., and from
there to Nevada, where Griffith came
to meet a woman, to whom he had
given a larpe part of the money. The
woman turned the money over to the
Inspector and her name was not di
vulged.

Culberson said that if explicit charges
were necessary, they could be found in
the case of Montague indicators and
in. that of John W. Pettlt. In the for
mer case there was, he said, accord
ing to the Bristow report, a mystery
as to whether former. First Assistant
Postmaster General Heath had received
25,000 shares of th*e stock of that con
cern. In the case of Pettit, that indi
vidual, it had been developed, had been
on the payroll of the Baltimore Post
office for four years 'without doing any
work, and It never . had been shown
whether he had been appointed to this
work by Heath or by Beavers.
"Give us an explicit charge and we
will take it up, though not on an ap
propriation bill."
"Then let us have one," suggested
Gorman, without rising, and Aldrich
continued: .
At the conclusion of Simmons' speecli,
Lodge urged his point of order against
the Culberson amendment and Gorman
insisted that, under a liberal construc
tion of the rules, the chair or the Sen
ate could hold anything in order. The
point of .order was sustained, but Gor
man persisted and made various modi
fications of the proposition in order to
bring it within the rule, and finally
eliminated all provisions for appro
priations.
"The . amendment in its _ present
shape," said Aldrich, "shows the folly
of attempting such legislation as this
on an appropriation bill. Mr. Gorman
has emasculated it so that It Is of no
effect whatever. If we. are to have an
investigation, let it be a live one."
POSTOFFICE E.MUROGUO.
Simmons answered the recent speech
of Spooner, who defended Postmaster
General Payne from what he treated
as an attack by Simmons in previous
remarks. Simmons declared to-day
that his remarks in relation to the
reluctance of the Postofflce Department
to undertake an investigation referred
to hesitancy on the part of former
Postmaster General Smith, and not to
the present Postmaster General. He
reiterated, however, his belief that the
investigation had been delayed, and
also that the present Postmaster Gen
eral had not treated fairly the offer of
S. W. Tulloch to give testimony In re
gard to conditions in the department.
This act of encouragement, said Sim
mons, was calculated to deter the work
of unearthing the scandals in the de
partment.
Simmons said he had been charged
with advocating the selection of a neu
tral man for President. "" He (Simmons)
had demanded a calm, well poised dis
position and mind and a judicial and
conservative temperament, and asked
whether that would be regarded a neu
tral man. Turning to the Republican
side, he said he supposed the candidate
wanted was one who would overturn
affairs of the twentieth century, make
new laws when the present ones did
not suit and treaties with foreign
countries without the advice or con
sent of the Senate. He said the coun
try has witnessed the spectacle of a
President holding forth on the one
hand as a trust-buster and on the other
as a safe man for business interests.
REPLIES TO SPOOXEK.
WASHINGTON, April 11.â The Cul
berson amendment to the postcrfflce ap
propriation bill, providing for a com
mission to investigate the Postofflce
Department, was before the Senate all
of to-day and, after being ruled out
of order In modified form, was pend
ing when the Senate adjourned.:
Gorman' made ah . earnest plea for
an investigation,' saying the Postofflce
Department had l cast reflections upon
members of Congress, and that a thor-;
ough examination should tie had. Al
drlch answered thatthe'amendment as
finally modified meant, nothing; that
if an Investigation was to be had. it
should be "a live one." He said thaV
if any specific charges were brought
in they should be looked into by Con
gress, but that the demand should not
be made a Dart of a general appro
priation bill.
Discussing newspaper statements that
the Republican leaders already had se
lected their candidate for President and
the platform on which they would
stand, Teller criticized the programme
as one to which the masses had not
the opportunity to contribute. He read
a statement to the effect that reci
procity would be a part of the pro
gramme, and asked Aldrich what he
thought of m the programme.
"I believe as you do," said Aldrich,
"that matters shtruld be left to the
convention."
Superintendent of Police Quirk is of
the opinion that revenge for being
dismissed from Houston Hall was the
motive for the murder, although he
has not entirely discarded the theory
of robtu-ry.
Gibson, whose complexion is so light
that he easily passes as a white man,
misrepresented himself as a student
at the university and married a young
white woman three weeks ago. When
the deception was discovered he was
discharged from Houston Hall. How
he expected to get revenge and his
reason for attacking the watchman the
police decline to say.
Self-defense is his pica. The watch
man, Gibson say?, evidently mistook
him for a thief ard attacked him. In
the struggle he unintentionally killed
the old man. The police do not be
lieve the story-

sometimes have the nameâ" Syrup of Figs"â of "Fig Syrup" and of some piratical concern,
or fictitious fig syrup company, printed on the package, but they never have the full name 01
the Companyâ California Fig Syrup Co.â printed on the front of the package. The imitations
should be rejected because they are injurious to the system. In order to sell the imitations
they find it- necessary to resort to misrepresentation or deception, and whenever a dealer passes
off on a customer a preparation under the name of "Syrup of Figs" or "Fig Syrup, which
does not bear the full name of the California Fig Syrup Co. printed on the front of the package,
he is attempting to deceive and mislead the patron who has-been so unfortunate as to enter ms

The Redondo is a vessel of 679 tons
register, and was builtlo 1902 at To
ledo, Ohio, for the lumber trade on
this coast. She is 18S feet long, 38 feet
in beam and 11.5 feet deep. Her hull
Is steel. She has a double . bottom,
where her liquid fuel is "stored. It is
expected that *fihe will sail to-morrow.
The Redondo belongs to Swayne &
Hoyt, and^is one of the sturdiest and
roomiest of vessels engaged In the
coasting trade. She is an oil burner
and well equipped for the long passage
for which she is preparing.. She has
been chartered by Roth, Blum & Co.,
as agents of the Kamtchatka Commer
cial Industrial Company of St. Peters
burg. The loss of the barkentine
Bering and the seizure by the Japanese
of the steamship Kotlc left Â£hls com
pany without vessels to carry supplies
to its fur sealing stations. The^e sup
plies, in the past, were bough" at Yoko
hama, but the war with Japan closed
that port to the Russian traders.
The Redondo's cargo, which includes
a large shipment of flour, is destined,
say the agents, for the company's sta
tions at Copper Island, Bering Island
and Petropavlovskl. The Redondo will
bring home the season's collection of
furs and make another trip, taking
more supplies and bringing here the
season's sealskin catch. The furs and
sealskins, hitherto forwarded to Lon
don by way of Yokohama, will be ship
ped to England by Roth, Blum & Co.
Captain Kros will command the Re
dondo, but Baron von Bruggin of St.
Petersburg will have charge of the ex
pedition, as those interested term the
business for which the Redondo has
been chartered. Captain Boeddie.
whose steamship, the Kotlc, was at
Nagasaki when the war commenced'
and was siezed by the Japanese, will
sail on the Redondo.
Baron von Bruggin, who arrived here
a few days ago from St. Petersburg,
is said to be the manager ofthe Rus
sian trading company which has char
tered the Redondo.
The steamship Redondo, at Mission
street wharf. Is loading flour and other
supplies for one of Russia's Pacific
ports. Although the bulk of her cargo
Is contraband of war, according to the
Japanese point of view, and will be ac
companied . across the. Pacific, by a
prominent Russian nobleman, it is
destined, say the charterers of the ves
sel, for strictly peaceful purposes.

NEWCHWANG. April 11.â An of
ficial explanation was issued to-day of
the firing of guns from the, forts here
last night, which caused a certain
amount of excitement and the killing
T>f two Chinese. It appears from the
official statement that, owing to the
fact that the officers of the garrison
did not understand the system of cus
toms flash signals in use at the mouth
of the river, for the purpose of signal
ing the depth of the water on the bar,
so as to enable ships to put to sea,
flre was opened last night'at some pilot
boats and o'utwaru'-bound merchant
men. These vessels were sighted by
the forts some time after midnight and
at 12:30 o'clock the artillery opened fire
upon them, twenty-four shots being
fired, including projectiles from large
guns. The effect of the fire had, not
been reported up to noon to-day, but
the firing caused excitement among the
troops, during which a sentry^ fired
upon and killed two Chinese opposite
the foreign settlement and three mem
bers of the forts. The Chinese had be
come alarmed at the firing and wer*Â»
endeavoring to cross the 'river.
In view of the i reports received here
of Japanese activity in Korea and of
the arrival of Japanese troops on the
Yalu River, it is understood that the
troops of the garrison had been fully
warned that it was possible the Japan
ese would make an attack on this place
and the citizens, on hearing the firing,
naturally supposed that the attempt
was being made last night.
LONDON. April 12.â The Tientsin
correspondent of the Standard says
that Russia has again protested
against the presence of Chinese troops
on the Manchurian frontier and has
demanded their withdrawal within a
five-mile limit of the great wall.
While it is not specifically stated
that China's failure to comply with
the Russian demands will be consid
ered a violation of Chinese neutrality,
this is believed to be the true account
of the situation. It is added that Kuro
patkin is disposing of 20,000 men where
they will be available for use in the di
rection of the Chinese frontier, but no
confirmation of this report is obtain
able.
* It is pointed out that, without the
consent of the Peking Government, the
Japanese officere who are with Gen
eral Ma, who is now north of the
Great Wall, easily can obtain domi
nant Influence over the Chinese troops
and use them If the Japanese opera
tions demand the creation of a diversion
In General Kuropatkin's rear, possi
bly resulting: in cutting- his communi
cations. If General Kuropatkin Is
compelled In time of stress to meet a
sudden and unexpected attack from
this quarter, it might greatly embar
rats him. Of course, the Poking Gov
ernment would disavow complicity, but
the harm would be done, " and Russia
considers that the immediate removal
of Japanese influence from the Chinese
army is imperative.
Official advices received here to-day
state that the Japanese forces in Korea
have made decided progress up to the
Yalu River. At the Japanese legation
it Is stated that fighting may be ex
pected within a few days, and this
statement is understood to be founded
upon quite recent cablegrams from^he
Foreign Office in Toklo.
ST. PETERSBURG, April 1Lâ The
reports that Lessar, the Russian Min
ister at Peking, had made strong.rep
resentatlons to the Chinese Govern
ment on the subject of the Japanese
military instructors in the service of
China and the Japanese officers with
General Ma's army, demanding the
Issuance of orders for their dismissal,
are confirmed here. Russia regards
their continued presence where they
are as being a inost f serious threat to
her.
6pec!aJ TMspatch to TbÂ» Call.
CALL BUREAU. HOTEL BARTON,
WASHINGTON. April 1Lâ The Rus
sian protest against the continued ser
vice of Japanese officers as military
instructors In the Chinese army is
tacitly approved by the United States,
and it is not improbable that similar
representations will be made to China
by the State Department. The activity
of the Chinese imperial troops under
General Yuan Shi Kai has not troubled
Secretary Hay and the President as
much as it has the Russian Govern
ment. Nevertheless the strain which
now exists between the forces at Pe
king which desire to maintain China's
neutrality and those which are anxious
to cast the lot of the empire with
Japan is considered a most vital ele
ment of the situation.
Germany is extremely restless about
the pro-Japanese tendency of General
Yuan Shi Kai and his lieutenant. Gen
eral Ma. Baron Sternburg, the Ger
man Embassador, has already made
the presence of Japanese officers in the
Chinese army the subject of a confer
ence with Secretary Hay.
Although Germany is keeping well
in the background, the preservation of
China'^ neutrality is extremely v^tal
to her. Germany initiated the agree
ment between the powers to respect
and to assist the neutrality of China
and to do all possible to limit the area
of hostilities.
It is learned that the Russian Gov
ernment several weeks ago sent a mil
itary agent to observe what effect the
presence of the Japanese officers was
having on the Chinese army. It is evi
dent that he learned that these offi
cers were fomenting pro-Japanese sen
timents. Otherwise the protests by
Minister Lessar to the Chinese Govern
ment probably would never have been
made.

"The First, Second, Third and Fourth

Corps is in ''Western Siberia, advancing
toward designated positions. These,
with the Tenth and Seventeenth Army

ceptionally reliable information regard
ing the Russian military plans confirms
the" repeated announcements that these
plans will not mature until late in the
summer. They are of far greater mag-,
nitude ; than is generally believed
abroad and _take into account-all pos
sible contingencies:
General Kuropatkin, v remembering
the experience of Russia . during her
war with Turkey, when the Russian
army placed in the field at" the'begin
ning had to be more than; doubled, has
insisted that the men and guns to be
placed at his disposal shall cover tho
extreme limit required to settle the fate
of the "campaign..
The : Russians plans are predicated
upon Napoleon's dictum that "God
fights oh. the side of the heaviest bat
talions," and they are being: worked out
and. timed so, as to apply to a superi
ority-of numbers on land and sea sim
ultaneously." The army is designed to
attain .the enormous total of 500,000
men at the , time scheduled for the re
inforcement of Vice Admiral Makaroff's

In contempt of court for not comply
ing with the writ of habeas corpus
which required them to bring before
the court to-day Charles H. Moyer,
president of the Western Federation
of Miners, whom they are holding in
confinement at Telluride. The court
ordered Sheriff Corbett to proceed to
Telluride and arrest the two 'military
officers and bring them before jj the
court. Judge Stevens severely criti
cized the course of Governor James H.
Peabody and the military authorities,
saying they appeared to be in insur
rection against the courts.
Moyer was arrested on March 26 on
a charge of flag desecration, and when
released under bonds several days later
he was immediately seized by the mili
tary authorities. General Bell has said
that the reason for holding Moyer is
"military necessity." ,
The return to the writ made by Gen
eral Bell, throu*gh Assistant District
Attorney David Howe of Telluride, ex
cused his failure to produce the body
of Moyer on the ground that he deemed
it -unsafe to bring Moyer to Ouray or
to reduce the military force' in San
Miguel County by so doing and that
the Governor had ordered him to dis
regard the writ.
Judge, Stevens refused to. permit the
filing of the return to the writ made
by General Bell and Captain Wells,
issued an order of attachment, against
them and assessed' a fine of $500 each,
and expressed regret .that the Gover

considered hlm-equally guilty with Gen

Ouray will rightly resent the imputa

"A very grave question', is presented
as to whether it is the striking miners
or a Governor of Colorado and a na
tional guard that are engaged in in
surrection and rebellion against the
laws of the State.
"When a condition of insurrection
exists here it is time enough to talk
of unsafety; but no such state of af
fairs does prevail here nor ever has.
"The charge against the law abiding

are no signs of violence here. If there

a lark of incident except that several
persons fainted, especially women and
soldiers .who had been on the piazza
since 4 o'clock this morning.
The simple Gregorian chant, forming
an immense volume like one voice
â¢with tree melody, produced a remarka

crmFiderc-d diQcult to attain in small
churches. The merit for the success
goes to Abbe Perosi, the prime mover
in the introduction of the Gregorian
chant.
After a brief halt In the Chapel of
the SacrainenL the Pope proceeded to
the throne. The triple crown was
placed on his head .by Cardinal Mac

the Pontiff celebrated mass to the ac

a special reserved plar* for the Pope's

The Slstine choir, directed bv Abbe
Perosi, who, together with Maestro

etrucfcir for to-day's Gregorian chant,
had a special box near the throne,
â¢\vhUe grouped around it were 1200

however, heightened the effect of the

Policeman G. C. Badenhauer learned
from . Mrs. F. L. Brown that she had
seen a man leaving the rear of her
residence Just before the fire. She saidi
the man was short, of stout build and
wore a bicycle cap. She noticed that
the bottom of his trousers were tucked
in as if he had been riding.
While these incipient fires were be
ing extinguished, a blaze was observed
in the basement of the house 1457 Ful

A baby carriage . containing a pillow
was found on fire. .
The fire marshal and the police are
investigating a suspicious fire that oc
curred at the Junction of Fulton and
Broderick streets early yesterday
morning.
It 'was found that some one had
stuffed some paper under the steps
in the rear of 634 Broderick street,
which is occupied by F. L. Brown.
Besides this a box had been set fire to
in the rear of 631 Broderick street.
About the same time a blaze was dis
covered at 1334 Fell street.
"General Wade, to whom General
Wood's report was" made and who
transmitted it to the department, adds
that the conditions in the Taraca Val
ley for the last three months have been
such as to render the above action ab
solutely necessary."
"Every effort was made to bring the
Moros to terras peacefully, but in each
Instance our troops were attacked be
fore firing a shot and force only was
used when other methods failed and
the enemy attacked us. The two chiefs
who have been at the bottom of all
the trouble on the east side of Lanao
for two years are now in hiding and
they will be arrested if possible.
WASHINGTON, April 1Lâ The fol
lowing bulletin was posted at the War
Department to-day:
"General Wood reports that he in
vited Sultan. Taraca to meet him at
Vicars on March 23 for consultation
and that the Sultan refused to come
and instead made extensive hostile
preparations. Marchingtolumns from
Marahut and Vicars left on the second
of April to assemble the cavalry. The
Vicars column was fired into all night
ten miles from Vicars and one enlisted
man was seriously wounded. The Mar
ahut column waa strongly resisted at
the mouth of the Taraca River and, al
though every effort was made to ac
complish a peaceful landing, ~ two en
listed* men were seriously wounded.
The combined force assembled in the
valley on the fourth of April and a
large number of hostile fortified cot
tas, occupied, were destroyed from
April 4 to April 1. The troops then
returned to their proper stations. New
comb, Company K, Seventeenth Infan
try and Wampler, CompanyD, Twenty
third Infantry, were killed.
Several Republican members took
this as a reflection on Morgan and
Dovener and declared that if they
were paired and voted they did so un
der a misapprehension.
The Speaker informed the Hous,e
that the stating of pairs in the Record
was purely a non-official matter, but
the* statement of the vote itself is of
ficial. Pairs, he said, frequently were
declared off without clerks being noti
fied. After Williams announced that
he was not criticizing anybody the
matter â¢was dropped. . â â¢ . v
The fallowing bills also -were passed:
For the relief of certain settlers on

of the Interior to correct the records
where double allotments of land have
been made to Indians and to correct

State of Oregon certain lands to be
used by It for the purpose of main
taining and operating a fish hatchery-
A Senate Joint resolution was passed
authorizing the issue of duplicate
medals for distinguished and meritori
ous service where the originals have
been lost or destroyed.
Williams, the minority leader, rising
to a question of privilege, called atten
tion to last Saturday's vote on the"
proposition to lay on the table the
Cockran resolution regarding the Pres
ident's pension order. He said that
the Congressional Record showed that
both Morgan of Ohio and Dovener of
West Virginia were recorded as voting
"aye" and at the same time appeared
as being paired with Snook of Ohio
and Trimble of Kentucky respectively,
which would have made the vote 101
to 100. He said that as neither Snook
nor Trimble voted the names of Mor
gan and Dovener should be taken from
the list of "yeas."
WASHINGTON, April 11. â The
House to-day passed the bill reported
by the Committee on Rivers and Har
bors, appropriating $3,000,000 for the
restoration or maintenance of channels
and for other .river and harbor im
provements. Burton, chairman of the
committee, in explaining the bill urged
the adoption of settled principles with
regard to river and harbor -work. Bur
gess of Texas and Ransdell of Louisi
ana favored Increases in the appro
priations for river and harbor im
provements, the former ' urging that
they should be doubled and the latter
regarding (100,009,000 as not too much.
Burton favored the policy of requir
ing communities interested in river or
harbor Improvements to participate in
the expenses and said preference
should be given to channels and har
bors which benefited a greater area.
Discussing tne question of inland
-waterways. Burton called attention to
the vast sums, amounting to many
millions of dollars, which would be re
quired to construct them, and declared

J. C. Stubbs, traffic director of the
Harriman. lines, departed last evening
for Bakersfield, where he purposes to
make his first inspection of the Cali
fornia oil industry, in which the South
ern Pacific Company is rapidly becom
ing largely interested. From there Mr.
Stubbs expects to go direct to Chicago,
unless his plans are altered by Presi
dent E. H. Harriman, who is now on
his way over the Western lines of the
big syndicate of, which he is the head.
It was arranged several days ago that
E. O. McCormick, assistant' traffic di
rector of . the Harriman lines, should
accompany his superior to Chicago, but
it was announced yesterday that VMr.
McCormick would remain here until
next Thursday. y
- The statement was given out yester
day, at the Southern Pacific Company's,
offices that George L. King, who has
been stenographer ta General Manager

to : the -new general Â¦ manager of the

assume the -work, heretofore performed
by -W. -A. Worthington, secretary -to
Mr. Kruttschnitt. That King does not
inherit the title of secretary, under
which Worthington has been desig
nated, /was explained yesterday , by the
statement that .the position of general
manager of the system, is no longer
an executive one and therefore the title
of "chief clerk", has been decreed the

The physicians that volunteered for
the work were each assigned a school
which they will visit from time to
time and note the health of the chil
dren. The teachers and principals
greatly facilitated the work by segre
gating the children that showed any
signs of Illness and submitting them
first for examination. Nothing of a
serious nature was unearthed by the
examination, but several cases of
mumps, a disease highly contagious
among children, were found In a mild
state. It is the belief of the doctors
that parents unwittingly send their
offspring to school when medical at
tention is imperative.
There are eighty schools to be visited
and but sixty, physicians to do the
work, so it will be several weeks be
fore every school child Is' passed. The
offices of the ( Health Department were
besieged by "parents and the telephone
lines were working overtime yesterday
on account of the children sent home.
It was explained to the fond parents
that the suspension was only tempo
rary, and that when the 'child had
fully recovered and a . certificate was
presented It could again take up Us
studies.
One of the most commendable inno
vations of the present Board, of Health
and one that Is certain to meet with
popular approbation was instituted
yesterday morning when sixty
volunteer physicians visited the var
ious schools to which they had been
assigned and made a careful exami
nation of all school children.
As a result many were found to be
suffering from mild attacks of dis
eases infectious in their nature, and to
avoid all possibility of the spread of
any contagion, the affllcled children
were ordered to their homes. The
health authorities make it mandatory
upon the parents to provide medical at
tention, and no child will be allowed
to return to school without a medical
certificate properly filled out by a
reputabVe practitioner, certifying that
a cure has been effected. .

Nicholas von Rubles, 1239 Franklin
street, and Miss. Lilly Baker, saloon
keeper, 533 Pacific street, called at the
Bond and Warrant Clerk's office yes
terday afternoon. - He is a thin, little
man and she a tall, buxom woman.
Von Rubles said that Miss Baker
had agreed to marry him on her next
birthday and in view of that promise
he had on February 23 given her
51100, with the understanding that she
would invest the money in a saloon,
which would be their joint property
after marriage.
Miss Baker bought the saloon and
procured the license in her own name.
She'also bought a piano on the install
ment plan' and 'other articles. When
Von Rubles asked her to marry him
she laughed at him and told him she
had been just playing him for "a
sucker" and would not have anything
to do with him.
That was his side of the story, but
Miss Baker denied that she had ever
promised to marry him. This anger
ed Von Rubles and he swore to a com
plaint before Police Judge Fritz charg
ing her with obtaining money by false
pretenses. She was taken to the City
Prison and booked on the charge.

The canteen at the California Sol
diers' Home which Bell proposes to
abolish has supported the band, cost
ing 1300 a month; it has also provided
$50 a month for books, newspapers
and periodicals: $125 a month for the
atrical entertainments, and has es
tablished and maintained pool and bil
liard tables, bowling alleys and shuf
fle boards. If the canteen goes the
band and amusements will have to
be cut out. The Legislature in - its
generosity may. hereafter allow -a sum
sufficient to maintain the band.
Delegates to the Department En
campment were amazed when they
were informed that no member of the
California delegation uttered a word
of remonstrance when Congressmen
from other States defamed California
on the strength of Bell's statement.
The Congressional Record now &t
hand shows that less than one hun
dred members of the House voted on
Bell's amendment. It is obvious that
Congressmen Metcalf. Needham, Dan
iels, McLachlan and Gillette were not
present.

FAIRBANKS INFORMED. >''â¢
Resolved, That this encampment believes that
It would be unwise to abolish the canteen con
ducted at the Soldiers' Home and we appror*
of the report of the said board of director*
and arguments made In its letter, whfth. In
the judgment of. this encampment, is satisfac
tory evidence of the necessity of canteens In
soldiers' homes, when properly guarded b7
wise rules and regulation**, such as evidently
control the canteen at the Veterans" Home at
Tountville.
Other telegrams as follows were sent:
Los Angeles. April S, 19<H-
The following resolutions .adopted by
the encampment were transmitted by
wire to the California delegation:
Resolved, By the Department of California
and Nevada, O. A. R., that the report sub
mitted by the Directors of the Veterans'- Homo
of California exhibits a gratifying condition
of affairs In its conduct and management, and
this encampment hereby approves of Â«ald min
aÂ«5em*nt by said board of directors, believing
that Its management reflect* credit upon thiÂ»
encampment, upon the country, upon the State
of California, and that the unselfish devotion
exhibited by said directors hereby mestÂ» with
our sincere, and hearty thanks.
DELEGATION* NOTIFIED.
The encampment at Los Angelw
wired the truth to the California dele
gation, showing that $21,000 of pension
money was : "deposlted during the last
tnree months, and of that amount $19.
600 was paid back in cash to members
of the home and their dependent rela
tives.
Pointed reference was made to Bell's
statement that the home in his dis
trict took the pensions of the veterans
and gave them canteen checks in re
turn. This statement, it appears, ex
*clted great Indignation in the House
of Representatives and, in fact,
prompted the Congressmen to support
the Bell amendment. .
Union veterans of the Civil War in
the recent Grand Army encampment
at Los Angeles freely expressed their
opinion of Congressman Bell of the
Second District. In committee of the
whole. House of Representatives. Bell
secured an amendment to the sundry
appropriation bill providing that no
Federal allowance should be appor
tioned to any State Home that main
tained a canteen. In the encampment
the charge was distinctly uttered that
the amendment was made in the in
terest of saloonkeepers adjacent to the
home in the Napa Valley.
After Matron Tierney had succeed
ed in quieting her, she told her own
sad story. Her husband had deserted
her a year ago, she said, and she and
her two babies were left to fight life's
battle alone. Her father. 68 years old,
cared for her and the little ones, for
they, were both alone in the world, her
mother having died some years be
fore. vl\4
"I have not a dollar," she said, "and
I don't know where to look for assist
ance to bury my poor father. Oh, this
is too cruel. When he left the house
on Sunday morning he said he was
going to take a ride in the cars. He
kissed the baby good-by, but he didn't
look me In the face."
Koons engaged a room in the Han
cock House at half past 8 o'clock last
Sunday night, and when the clerk
asked his name, he replied: "Oh, put
me down as Smith or Brown; any old
name will do." When he was found
the next day one end of a rubber tube
was in his mouth and the other was
attached to the gas burner, the valve
of which was open. The keyhole and
the space under the door had been
stuffed with paper to prevent the es
cape of gas.
Koons sold his wood and' coal busi
ness, at 847 Mission street last Friday
to avoid" the importunities of credit
ors. Th-jn he deliberately killed him
self, forgetting the daughter and the
grandchildren that were dependent
upon him. . .
Koons has a brother, a minister of
the gospel, at Laporte, Iowa.
"He was my only support," she said.
"I had only him to look up to with
my two little children on my hands,
and If anything should happen to him
I don't know what would become of
us.", t'-V" -
Deputy (Coroner McCormlck knew
that while the poor woman was speak
ing the dead body of E. B." Koons lay
on a slab downstairs in the morgue.
The aged father, of the lonely little
woman had taken his own life on the
preceding evening by inhaling illumi
nating gas through a rubber tube in
a lodging-house at 781 Mission street.
Somebody had to tell the weeping lit
tle woman that her father, wearied of
life's struggle, had died a suicide, and
Mr. McCormick broke the unwelcome
news as gently as possible. For five
minutes the morgue building echoed
with the wails of the afflicted daugh
ter. > ;-Vv,t: V: :
Mrs. Clarke of 51 Hoff avenue called
at the Coroner's office yesterday'after
noon to report that her father,
Ephralm B. Koons, had been away
from home all night, and she feared
that some evil might have befallen
him. - : >V:- : - : \-- ;:
The evangelist reviewed his first
day's labor in connection with the six
teen churches of the Mission, which
united for the purpose of the evan

of the more than forty persons on Sun
day who expressed their desire to be
ccme active Christians.
CANDIDATES FOR CONFERENCE.
At the same meeting the following
candidates for the episcopacy, to be
elected at the coming session of the
General Conference in Los Angeles,
T\ere mentioned as prominently spoken
of throughout the East: Dr. E. T.
Taylor, missionary secretary in New
England; Dr. J. R. Berry, editor of the
Epworth Herald; Dr. Day, president of
Syracuse University; Dr. Bashford.
president of Ohio Wesleyan University;
Dr. W. F. McDowell, secretary board
of education: Dr. Charles Mitchell of
Cleveland. Ohio; Dr. Leonard, mission
ary secretary; Dr. G. F. Bovard of Los
Angeles. Dr. Jennings or Chicago, Dr.
Henry Spellmeyer of Newark, N. J.,
and many prominent men in New York.
"Divine Dispensation" was the sub
ject of an address by Rev. Dr. F. H.
Marr before the Congregational min
isters' meeting. Rev. William Rader
presided.
Members of the Christian Church
Ministers' Association met yesterday
afternoon in the Y. M. C. A. building.
The matter of the attendance of all
the churches at the opening of the new
West Side OKristian Church building
the first Sunday in May on the invita
tion of Dr. W. M. White was discussed.
In sneaking of the heroism of the
ministers. Dr. Vosburgh believed that in
the near future the clergy will have
as great an influence as it ever had in
the past.
Hugh E. Smith, the evangelist, who
is conducting a series of union evan
gelical meetings at Grace Methodist
Episcopal Church, corner of Twenty
first and Capp streets, also addressed
the Methodist ministers.
The fifth problem, said the doctor,
is the great social movement culminat
ing in the fact that there are 2,000,009
wage earners in the unions in this
country who are not in the church. They
are skeptical and feel that the church
cares little for them.
The Rev. Dr. Vosburgh of the First
Baptist Church, Oakland, addressed
the Methodist Ministers* Association at
Epworth Hall yesterday morning, his
subject being "Ministers in Modern
Life."
The problems advanced by Dr. Vos
burgh were: First, lukewarmness of
the church itself; second, the modern
power of education, which is not al
ways favorable to Christianity; third,
attitude of the higher criticism, which
the doctor himself did uot fear, but as
serted that it did frighten more people
and manifestly presents some difficul
ties; fourth, modern science, which,
the speaker said, is rather material
istic. He said that it has been so far
misunderstood by many ministers, and
Is supposed to present greater difficul
ties than it really does. .'..*-Â¦'
DR. VOSBURdH'S PROBLEMS
The Rev. Moses Bercovltz said that
from his experience infidels gladly re
ceive the doctrine { of "conditional im
mortality." He, himself, sustained the
doctrine of eternal punishment.
Dr. J. S. McDonald wished that the
same argument of immortality could
be used against the devil. If they
could get him out of the world, it
would be an advantage.
Dr. Guy W. Wads worth, president of
the Occidental College, said that "man
in his present fallen condition cannot
see the justice of eternal conscious suf
fering as a punishment for sin."
The doctor said that the question is.
Is man an impartial judge of the proper
penalties for his own sins? He asked
whether a convention composed of
criminals could be relied upon to fix
proper penalties for their crimes. He
said that sin might deserve a worse
punishment than sinners thought.
Dr. Toll spoke of Mrs. Botkin and the
unceasing fire of expression that has
followed her with the determination
that for her sin she should be banish
ed from society, and in the eyes of the
law she is dead.
The Rev. Mr. Sitton. the Rev. Mr.
Herriott and the Rev. James Wood
worth joined in the discussion.
The doctor asked his audience to look
at the records of the police courts,
where they would find both menÂ»and
women brutes.
REFERS TO POLICE RECORDS.
Dr. William Alexander did not be
lieve in any condition of unconscious
immortality. He said that if man is
taught that death is annihilation he
will live like a brute and die like a
brute, or worse.
â¢ Dr. H. W. Fraser's address before
the Presbyterian Ministers' Association
at the Presbyterian Mission House
yesterday morning on "Conditional
Immortality" was the occasion for in
teresting arguments.
\ Dr. Fraser held that since "The Fall"
! man is not, naturally, immortal. He
| receives his 'immortality through Je
j sus Christ. The possession of this life
j which he receives means immortality
| and its absence means death, extinc
tion of being.
Dr. Fraser said that "conditional
immortality" does not mean that there
i Is no future world. It emphasizes the
! truth that there is a heaven to win
! and a hell to shun. They who profess
i this doctrine do not believe that exter
1 nal punishment means eternal con
i sciousness.
The Rev. Mr. Bevier said it was not
; good for the race to minimize the idea*
j of suffering, and he considered the
j whip of fear was beneficial.
There will be an auction of a big
lot of "Uncle Sam's condemned goods

to join a fraternity? Are you 'in fa

ties to refrain from rushing a man

narrow? What do you think of the

of fraternity men to Jive beyond their

Scavengrrs' Cases in Court.
OAKLAND, April 1Lâ William Dunn,
a plasterer, and William Davis, a la
borer, 73 years old, were burned to
death last night in the fire that swept
through half a block of rookeries at
Ninth and Franklin streets. The bodies
were recovered this morning from the
ruins. Both men, It is supposed, were
asleep in the Model lodging-house
when the flames swept through the
flimsy, ramshackle frame building, cut
ting them off from escape.
The bodies were dismembered by the
Intense heat. Their position showed
that the two victims had occupied
rooms in the rear of the lodging-house,
over the end of the Japanese club
rooms, in which the flre 1b supposed to
have started. So swiftly did the flre
eat through the wooden building that
the imprisoned men, It is believed, per
ished without a chance to escape.
Coroner Mehrmann took charge of
Search through the mass of debris
was commenced at daybreak by the po
lice, because it had been feared that
some fatalities might have resulted
among the occupants of the lodging
house. It was impossible last night
during the fire to account for the lodg
ers, for they were, in the main, tran
sients, and unknown even to the keep
er of the place, which was of the
cheapest order.
All that was left on the half block be
tween Eighth and Ninth streets, facing
the east side of Franklin, was the large
carriage factory of J. F. W. Sohst, at
the northeast corner of Eighth j and
Franklin, practically intact; the gutted
cottage adjoining on Franklin street,
that had been a Japanese lodging
house, and the ruined Chinese lodging
house on Ninth street, that marked the
the charred remains, which were iden
tified by some of the former compan
ions of the two men.

trouble for her." -
First she wanted him to buy her a
lodging-house and he gave her $3000,
but when they inspected it he declared
it not worth $250. Then he proposed
to buy a lot and build a house for her
in Berkeley, so that she could take
boarders. She was agreeable to this
and he put $10,000 in. the bank for her.
Instead of the house costing $10,000,
however, it has cost $20,000. Hunker
has been digging down in his pockets
quite often of late. This was too good
ti- last, though, and finally Hunker de
cided to get rid of the woman.
"I wanted to help this woman out,"
he said to-day. "She was poor and 1
didn't know anything better to do for
her than to start her in business. I
set $10,000 aside for her for a house
and now that house has cost $20,000. I
got tired of the graft at last and went
to the courts to have Mrs. Carroll
ejected, as she had refused to leave the
house.
EXPENSES INCREASE.
Hunker looks upon Mrs. Carroll as
the most ungrateful person he ever
kr.ewÂ» He says she came to him a
year ago with the claim that she was
his cousin. Strangely enough he did
not Question her claim to relationship,
though that was the first time he knew
about it. He assisted her in a material
way.
Of course when Hunker was notified
of this sacrilege he hurried to^ Berkeley
post haste. He was angry- clear
through and swore vengeance. The
next day an expressman showed up to
take more things away, but he was
scared off when Hunker saw him. Since
then Hunker has been expecting a vis
itation from Mrs. Carroll any time and
is constantly on guard.
Hunker was so well satisfied with
his victor}' that he did not go near the
house on that day. He let two Deputy
Sheriff go out to take possession of
the house. But when the Deputy Sher
iffs arrived they found that Mrs. Car
roll had b?Â»en there before them. She
had taken away most of the furniture
and had a lot packed up for future de
livery to the expressman. The window
curtains were gone, bed covers gone, as
was everything that could be moved in
a hurry. Some of the things that could
not be carted away easily were stored
in the house of a neighbor, who had
received them on the strength of Mrs.
Carroll's statement that they were for
storage. <Â¦; *
RRMOVES FURNITURE.
The whole case was fought out In
Judpe Melvin'8 court last Friday. Hun
ker had no difficulty in proving that
the house in question is his own. In
her own behalf Mrs. Carroll sought to
show that it had been given to her by
Hunker as an enEragemont present.
Hunker denied that matrimony ever
figured in the transaction at all. Any
way Judge Melvin said that Mrs. Car
ioll was wrong and gave Hunker pos
session of the house.
Andrew Hunker, the man that dis
covered the Hunker Creek mines in the
Klondike and dug three or four millions
in gold tut of them, is guarding him
self against a woman. He is not ex
actly undergoing a siege, but he expects
his castle at 242S Bancroft way to be
stormed any minute and he 6wears he
isn't going: to take any chances that
may be altogether unnecessary.
The millionaire miner, for he is rated
as such, claims Mrs. Christine Carroll
fcr his nemesis. Mrs. Carroll's actions
in regard to the aforesaid castle on
Bancroft way displeased him awhile
apo and he requested her to go. She
refused and he appealed to the law. It
t^ok a writ ot restitution, backed by
the law. to finally accomplish her eject
ment

Town Marshal Kerns and his deputy,
Bert Howard, were summoned to the
ucene and a close watch kept of the
premises. A search, was made of the
basement with no success, however. An
examination of the rear door of the
Ftore showed that a hole had been cut
in It in an endeavor to reach the lock.
If the bursrlar had been successful he
would have had access to a lot of jew
elry and watches.
The burglar that entered the Gentry
store pot in through a. broken window.
Once in. he had access to a case
of watches valued at $100, which he
proceeded to take with him. This bur-
Rlary was not discovered until this
morning.
Thompson opened flre with his pistol
the instant he saw the man, but he
must have missed, for the Quarry turn
ed and raa back to a little phed at
?he rear of the store, then crawled un
derneath. Restaurateur Henderson
saw the man from his window, but as
he had no weapon he could no* stop
him. Then Thompson, thinking to In
tercept him when he emerged from the
front of the building, went around, but
the man never came out.
The man that tried to do the trick
nt Curry * Putzkers place was discov
ered at work at 2 o'clock this* morn
ing by William Henderson of the Owl
restaurant. Henderson notified Special
Officer George Thompson, and Thomp
son went to the rear of the store to
head th/* fellow or fellows o(T.Â» As he
nx^proa^hed the place Thompson sud
denly saw a man loom up a hundred
feet in front of him. The man had evi
dently become suspicious and begun a
retreat.
Burglars were rife in Berkeley last
night, and the town seems to be in
for a Biege from the plundering knights
of the dark lantern. One of them,
oaught in the act of entering the store
of R. A. Curry and Otto A. Putzker
at T142 Shattuck avenue, was shot at
for his pains, but he was lucky enough
to escape. Another of the gentry
wormed his way into John A. Gentry's
jewelry store at Sixth street and San
Pablo avenue and got away with $100
worth of watches.

papers Indorsed by the American Con

In regard to the protest, Chang You
tong, secretary of the Chinese World's
Fair Commission, said to-night:
"My countrymen were subjected to
humiliating treatment at San Fran
cisco, where they were held up by the
customs officials for two days, despite
the fact that they had sufficient money
with them to justify statements that
they were. reputable citizens of China
and not paupers. They also had signed
letters from the American Consul at
Peking, stating their financial and so
cial standing in China, but they were
forced to furnish bond In the sum of
$506 sold each before the customs offi
cials would release them."

D. McDougall, a tailor.'in endeavoring
to- escape from a blazing room last
night, plunged madly through a win
dow, cutting an artery in his left fore
arm and badly lacerating. his face and
hands, that had already been ; pain

fire originated : in the overturning of
a' large eon # oil lamp.
â¢McDougall made several futile efforts
to extinguish the rapidly spreading
flames and in doing so his clothes
caught fire, his hands and face were
badly burned andfhis hair singed.
Realizing that the fire was becoming
master of the situation, he turned to
escape, but found his way. shut oft by
flames, so he plunged through the front
window of his' small? establishment,"
sustaining the injuries mentioned.
The fire had gained considerable
headway before the department
reached the scene, but it was soon ex
tinguished. The building occupied by
McDougall and the one adjoining it,
used Â»by James Rosa as a carpenter
shop, are owned by the latter, who es
timates his loss at about $300.

PORTLAND, Or., April 11.â Called
from his farm at Amboy. Clarke Coun
ty, Wash., to hurry to the bedside of
his dying wife in a Portland hospital,
Frank Gerber. walked forty miles dur
ing Saturday night and reached his
wife a few hours before she died. When
the long tramp was finished ten years
had been added to the lines of his face.
If rs.~ Gerber went to the hospital a
few days ago for a slight operation. A
sudden turn for .the worse necessitated
a telegram to Gerber. The last train
until Monday for Vancouver had . gone
when Gerber received the message late
Saturday evening, but he at once set
out to walk f ory miles along the rail
road track. Three small children were
left at home. Never once during the
night did. he slacken the steady pace
set at. the beginning.
Â¦ At 8 o'clock yesterday morning he
staggered into Vancouver and took the
ferry across the Columbia for the Port
land car. Gerber did not know until he
reached the hospital whether his terri
ble walk had been in vain. . He is a
man of slight physique, and the strain
marked him deeply. Mrs. Gerber died
last evening, : apparently contented, aa
her husband was with her at the last.

MR. HEARST'S Presidential campaign proceeds, in
spots. While it. seems to have roared louder in
the prospectus than in the performance, still it is
alive enough to give the Democracy a pain. It serves to
illustrate plainly the confusion of the party as to issues.
In Texas Mr. Hearst relies on Governor Hogg. Hogg is
an interesting man. He is several times a millionaire,
dresses carelessly, makes money easily, 'having the ac
quisitive faculty, and does a deal of roaring against other,
rich men. No one knows why he does this, unless it is
caused by a sense of rivalry anda desire to Hogg it all
The Houston Post has been roasting Hogg and has
made it so .warm for him that he is out in a letter,'which
Mr. Hearst publishes with air the grace and garnish of
black type. In it the Governor catechises Judge Parker,
through the Post, to ascertain his standing on public
questions. Among other things'; he wants to know if
he will build the Panama canal, and demands that he
oppose our authority in : the' Philippines. .
In this it appears that' the party is divided about the
construction of the canal. Mr. Hearst at first denounced
the Panama affair and attacked the only sure means ever
secured for building the canal as disgraceful to this coun
try and "the dragging of American honor in the mud
of Panama." Later on he came out in favor of the canal,
moved thereto by the strong Southern sentiment" in its
support. :; Now Governor Hogg'is.afraidthat 'Judge'.' Par
ker will not take -his spade' in hand and dig the': canal.
On this; issue we. beg tc ask the brethren what better
canal digger . do they want than President ~ Roosevelt?
If this is one of the main issues, all'they have to do is

There is a profit in such work, when
intelligently managed, of 25 to Z2% per
cent. Probably more than 100.000 acres
of "artificial" oyster beds are made to
grow an oyster crop in addition to the
acreage embraced In the "natural"
beds. The area of "artificial" beds Is
Increasing rapidly each year.
One singular feature about the oyster
is this: They ail look exactlv alike,
there be.Insr no difference between the
male and the female externally or in
ternally; in fact, the "art of man Is
not sufficient to distinguish one sex
from the other. Another unique fea
ture is this: The male oyster "lays"
as many eggs as the femaleâ "equal
rights," we perceive. The eggs of the
male are called "milt," and the eggs
of the female are called Vspawn."' An
ordinary full-grown oyster Is supposed
to lay a million eggs a year. In spawn
ing season the water is full of these
eggs, and when the "milt" and the
"spawn" come in contact and the water
Is at the right temperature, life is
imparted to the microscopic egg and
it, drops to the bottom, where,' if it
succeeds in grasping hold of something
such. as. another oyster or shell or
rock, or anything to hang to, the
tiny creature begins to form Its . shell
and in a few weeks becomes' visible to
the eye.
The oyster farmers are harvesting the
crop at present. While the greater por
tion of the United States is under snow
and In the grasp of winter, our -oyster
farmers are busv harvesting their
crop, which requires no fertilizer, food
or fencing and costs only, for the see.d,
the Bowing ', and the harvesting, and
which pays a good dividend on the In
vestment. Prom 12,000 to 15,000 hands
are engaged In the oyster work In
Eastern Virginia. It is an odd sort of
farming, and the oyster farmers In
winter become corn farmers in sum
mer. .
In Eastern Virginia* there are several
thousand acres of oyster farms, where
oysters are' raised by artificial meth
ods on artificial beds. The "natural"
oyster bed is where the oyster breeds
and matures naturally. There are thou
sands of acres of such beds in the
Chesapeake Bay system of salt water.
In such beds the oysters breed by the
millions and as they are too close to
gether there they cannot all reach a
satisfactory growth. If taken when
small from these "natural" beds and
strewn along on the . bottoms where
there are no oysters naturally at the
rate, of 600 to 1000 bushels per acre,
such young oysters mature and ripen
off for the market, some in one and
the resfii* two years.

THE fifty 7 fourth annual report of the Chamber of
Commerce of San Francisco, which has just been
issued, includes current commercial and industrial
history of San Francisco in epitome. More than two hun
dred pages are crowded with statistical matter, all relat
ing to the business of San Francisco, its manufactures,
banking, real estate, commerce, trade, and the related in
terests which center in this city as the greatest seaport
on the Pacific coast of the United States. Many of the
facts that are found in the report have, necessarily, been
given publicity before, but there are others that are here
assembled for public review for the first time with the
sanction of an organization making a specialty of such
useful work.
. The Chamber of Commerce presents, as might be in
ferred from the bare statement referring to its statistical
opulence, such a compendium that an intelligent student,
by devoting the proper time and attention to the matter,
may know much about material San Francisco. The first
thought that will occur to many is that such a document
would be valuable for use at St. Louis during the
Louisiana Purchase Exposition. Unquestionably, in con
nection with other literature and distributed with dis
crimination, it would prove vastly interesting to seekers
for comprehensive knowledge.
The figures are not confined to returns for 1903. In
carefully compiled tables the statistics of many years
are placed in juxtaposition, so that the analyst. may be
able to trace with certainty the advancement that has
been achieved in all lines of endeavor and the rate of
such progress. A city that is continually improving
holds out promises and attracts the striving and the
ambitious."
One series of tables shows, the normal climatological
data for various points in the State for a period of twenty
five years, as compiled by the 'United States Weather
Bureau. One page is devoted to figures relative to the
rainfall in San Francisco for every year since 1849.
Climate and rainfall are sufficient considerations to induce
many to cast in their lot" with the community that is
favored in these particulars. -
George A. Newhall, aspresident of the Chamber of
Commerce, supplies valuable facts that are not to be
found in. the annual returns of any other organization.
lays emphasis upon the statement that there was a
balance of $14,600,000 in favor of San Francisco in 1903
as between imports and exports! The manufactures of
thiSjCityin 1903 were estimated by him at' more * than
$150,000,000. This is indorsed by the chamber by in
cluding it in the annual report of the body. Of the mopey
invested in real estate in San Francisco last year Presi
dent Newhall shows that $38,166,868 was new capital.
It is pleasing to learn, that the chamber gained forty
members 'in twelve months. would accrue to
jising Californians if the annual report of the Chamber
of Commerce should be made the basis of some careful
lessons in the higher school grades in this city, at least.
It does no harm for the San Francisco boys and the girls
to havean intelligent idea of the greatness of the business
and commerce of this' port while they are finding out in
their geographies about the world at large, to which its
services are so greatly auxiliary.' . .

That Ross was wrong and WIlke3
right is very evident from the report of
Captain Scott of the British Antarctic
expedition of 1901-04. Captain Scott
shows that the mass of Ice seen by
Ross is in reality an extensive glacier
resting on land and covering the land
like the Ice cap of Greenland. The
glacier is about 700 miles wide, and
reaches the sea through a plain lying
between Victoria Land and Edward
VII Land. The German expedition
under Von Drygalski, working 80 de
grees of longitude farther west, also
found a somewhat similar expanse of
Ice-capped land, whose 'limits they
were unable to trace, but which Is ap
parently a part of the same Antarctic
continent.â National Geographic Mag
azine. â¢ ',.-
That a vast Antarctic continent ex
ists, perhaps twice as large as that of
Europe, would seem to be proved by
the reports now appearing of the re
cent explorations in that region. The
American Commander Wilkes, return
ing from the far south in 1841, asserted
the existence of a vast South Polar
continent, and described his voyage of
1500 miles in sight of the coast. Ross,
however, returning soon after, .dis
credited Wilkes' conclusions, saying
that the land seen by Wilkes was
merely a great wall of ice. The world
has been in doubt which to believe.

The proposition to erect a building
for the United States Supreme Court
within the capitol grounds and to the
northeast of the capitol building, rela
tively distant from it as is the Con
gressional library, has many champions
in both houses.* This completed it will
dve further * jm within the capitol
to the uses of members of Congress.
In all the discussion concerning the
*Mty beautifulâ the city of the present,
the city of the future â there has been
not eo much as a hint that Washington
may not always be the capital of the
The practical part of the improve
ment is the addition by the extension
of sixty-six rooms , greatly needed.
Thirty-three of these are to be appor
tioned to the Senate and a like num
ber to the House. This will enable
the Senators now occupjing office
rooms in the Mallby building, or the
Senate Annex, so called, to be gath
ered with their fellows under the roof
of the capitol. There are exactly
thirty-three of these housed, officially,
in the annex. The cry for more room
in the capitol building has been heard
throughout the session from both ends
of the capitol' and the evident neces
sity will create sympathy in the Senate
for the proposed improvement.
The plan, of course, introduces no
innovations. A suggestion of such a
thing would not be tolerated. The ex
tended center carries with it the
architectural forms, while it adds vastly
to the strength and dignity of the
building by bettering Its proportions.
Tho present east wall will remain and
form the rear wall of a courtyard
created by the extension and will be
visible from the corridors of the new
section. This wall opens directly from
the portico to the rotunda. With the
extension a vestibule. 108 feet deep,
lined with marble, will lead from the
r*?w portico, forming a grand entrance
to the rotunda. The old rotunda Is
itself to be transformed by marble.
The extension will, of course, neces-
Mtate material changes In the sur
rounding grounds and the romoval of
the statute of .Washington that has
been pointing upward for so many
years from its place in front of the en
trance.
The j>lans are those of the late
Thomas A. Walter, who built the pres
rnt north and south Â¦wings. These
extensions were complied in 1859, but
Sir. Walter had foreseen the possible
demand for further extension incident
to expansion and growth of the coun
try and gave his attention to the
preparation of plans which, , in his
opinion, would develop the original
idea to a point where the word "com
lilete" might be written. These he left
as a heritage and it is to the realiza
tion â¢ of these plans forty-five years
after they were begun by the great
architect as a dream of the far future
that the House of Representatives has
actually appropriated the money. It
should be said .that this appropriation
Â¦was made last session by the House,
but the Senate was not ready to act.
The model, however, was authorized
by the bill. This was completed last
December and has only now been
brought to view. It has attracted
preat attention, being constantly sur
rounded by mixed crowds of Congress
men and visitors discussing its merits.
One of these is the appropriation
of half a million dollars to be spent
this fiscal year in the work of complet
ing the capitol building, which work
it If expected will cost two and a. half
millions and consume at least two
years' time. In the rotunda of the
capitol. the figure upon the apex of its
dome pointing up to the great hollow
of the jrreat dome above it, stands a
miniature in white plater of the com
pleted capitol â a miniature of what will
be when finished on these lines, the
most beautiful architectural structure
in the world. This is the Judgment of
many men of taste and knowledge.
That which remains to be done to thus
complete the building is to extend the
center or main portion of * the east
front, bringing it more into conformity
â¢with the building as it is on the west.
The wings on the east front at pres
ent extend beyond the center. The
dome rises from the east front almost
directly from the wall or back of the
building. When the building is com
pleted the main wall of the center will
have been extended to the line of the
fteps of the Senate and House wings,
while a further projection of nearly
two-thirds of the distance of the main
projection will carry with it the por
tico and pediment which dominates the
central feature. The bald face of the
central building on each Bide of this
portico as it now stands is. in the com
pleted plans, relieved by columns. Thus
Â«>lumns extend clear across the face
of the building with a double column
across the three porticos â center and
wings.
WASHINGTON. April 10â "The most
magnificent capitol in the world" Is
the dream of Congress with regard to
the citv of Washington. Both houses
have fpent a deal of time this session
in the discussion of great projects for
the beautifiostion of the city and two
important measures have passed, one
the Senate, the other the House, look
ins to that end. Both will no doubt
become law.

England is committed to the neutrality anjd integrity of
Chinese territory Great Britain would be justified, on the
same grounds; in declaring war against Russia.
Â¦ It may be safely said that the people of this country
do not want Russia as a champion in anything. Nor do
we believe that the Western nations desire that Russia
be promoted to the mastery of the world as will be the
case if she annex China. The Russian system of govern
ment is less desirable than the Chinese and still less de
sirable than the Japanese. If China follow the civilized
lead of Japan her reformers and intelligent statesmen will
take the lead and the people will be trained in the opera
tion of representative government and institutions. But
if China become Russian the administration will be worse
than now. Surely there is nothing in the government of
European Russia that the nations with parliaments and
systems of jurisprudence desire to copy.
Russian reform is. out of the question. The autocracy
under the thumb of the Holy Synod has stubbornly with
stood all pressure for reform. The brains of Russia, rep
resented by Tolstoi, are under the ban. Not content
with political persecution, the Holy Synod assumes to
shut Russian intelligence out of heaven by the solemn
process of excommunication from the orthodox church.
Russia in no way represents the civilization, the intelli
gence, the civic institutions, the aspirations or religious
liberty of the white race and Americans will repudiate
at once any such pretense.
Our dispatches from Peking and St. Petersburg give in
detail the effrontery of the measures which Russia pro
poses as preliminary to the military annexation of China.
It is among the world's moral emergencies. What has
the yellow race done that calls for a white race cham
pion against it? The yellow races are not threatening
white race territory with conquest. They are not in arms
against the Western powers. They are recognized as
members of the family of nations and are represented by
Ministers to all the leading governments. They are in
treaty relations with the rest of the world and in Japan
have a civilization higher and in all respects better than
â¢that of Russia. *
Races, nations and peoples need a champion when they
are in peril, when their rights are in danger and their
liberty is threatened. None of the white races is in this
condition. It is impossible for the yellow races to injure
them. What the white races want is that all of the yel
low men work out their civilized salvation as the Japan
ese have done. Then their progress will begin, their
wants will increase as they rise in the scale and their
trade will invite only the commercial competition of .the
white nations.
Russia is conducting in this country a hot propaganda
for sympathy. The incidents in the history of our Civil
War are being made much of. One gentleman remem
bers that the Czar told him that if England had recog
nized the Confederacy he would have instantly declared
war against Great Britain. That has all the elements of
a fairy tale. But taking it for the truth what is the prece
dent it establishes? English recognition of the Confeder
acy would have been a move for the dismemberment of
the United States. If the Czar told the truth about the
state policy of Russia, a Russian declaration . of war
against China now would be exactly what English recog
nition of the Confederacy would have been in 1862. As
THE British conquest of India was openly andfrank
ly commercial. The peninsula had been for ages
under alien masters. The Hindoos had paid but lit
tle attention to the defensive arts and were overrun in
turn by the stronger races. The Mahometan conquest,
made by the descendants of Tamerlane, established the
Mogul Empire which the English overthrew. Begun by
the East India Company as a "commercial enterprise en
tirely, since the British Government took administration
away from the company it is believed that the English
have beeh the best masters that have ever ruled India.
Anyway there was no pretense 1 of race championship or
philanthropy about it and England has had to stand crit
icism of her methods from qt^te another point of view..
The Russian conquests that have at last crossed Asia
are equally commercial. " They are equally . in
their motives and have been pushed with equal or greater
inhumanity toward the weak peoples that have been
ridden down by the Cossacks. There is no reason to be
lieve that humanity has had any more part in them than
in the wars of Genghis Khan and Tamerlane. But now
Russia assumes a philanthropic attitude and desires to
pose as the champion of the white race against the yel
low, and makes this appeal to race prejudice to cover a
declaration of war upon China. To this end the nagging
goes on.

The plans matured and discussed, at
least in the Senate, without dissent, as
a thing practically agreed upon, con
templates the purchase of the exten
sive triangle between the mall and
Pennsylvania avenue from the Botanic
Gardens â which face the Capitol
gToundsâ to the Treasury, at Fifteenth
street. The shabby structures that
front the avenue on the south side for
nearly this whole distance are to be
replaced by great public buildings, as
they may be required, and constructed
for the Federal or district Govern
ment. The buildings are to be given a
beautiful setting of green, back from
the thoroughfare, and with ample
room. In their mind's eye the Sena
tors who discuss these plans see in the
Pennsylvania avenue of the future the
noblest highway In the world. There
is on the south side of the avenue now
the postoffice building and the new
municipal building is to be placed
there. And there a place for the pro
posed new State Department building
will undoubtedly be found in spite of
all efforts to add it to the group of
department buildings about the White
House. For not only does the majority
look to it that the proposed new build
ings shall be architecturally creditable
to the capital of the greatest nation,
but that their location shall be chosen
to lend every possible charm.
This was contemplated In the original
plans of the city as prepared by
L'Erifant. In the plan as elaborated
by the Park Commission, a sweep of
lawn stretches 300 feet wide down this
vista, bordered by trees to 4 width
of the capitol and the evident neces-
Between this and the line of public
buildingrs which it is designed shall

drives and walks, making a total width
of the mall of S90 feet, extending in a
direct line west from* the capitol to

nation. Millions are contemplated In
the plans for improvements now before
Congress, j I said two measures had
passed, each one house of Congress;
that would "seem to confirm Washington
as the capital to the end of the life
of the nation. The Senate measure re-'
ferred to carries no dollar of appropria
tion with it, but is the forerunner of
a sweeping Improvement. It is the
Newlands bill, making it unlawful to
construct a building within 445 feet on
each side of a line drawn from the
center of the dome of the capitol to
the apex of the Washington monu
ment. The Agricultural Department
had selected a site for its new build
ing within this line and the bill is in
tended to prevent its location there
and to estop any future plans within
the area being formed. The purpose
of the bill is to guarantee a grand
vista from the west front of the cap
itol down the mall to the monument.

Next Governor Hogg wants to be assured that Judge
Parker will immediately, admit the Philippines as States
of this Union or as Ian- alternative , surrender them en
tirely. Npw all this in the ' face j of the fact that in 1898!
Mr. Hearst was whooping over the longest leased wire
in the world, "Nail the flag to the Philippines! Nail it."
This he printed at the top of what he considers the most
impressive page in all his newspapers in all kinds of type,
and all kinds of colors! He roasted President McKinley
for not nailing the flag fast enough to those islands, and
his American soul raged in his ribs on that account.
He abused the President roundly and continuously, de
claring that he had not American sand enough to take
the Philippines. ;â¢;Â¦- ,;-./â¢Â¦;
/Does Hogg know this? Or has Mr. Hearst changed
and has he a claw hammer up his sleeve to pull, out the
nails and let the flag down? At a time when the country
had very conservative ideas about the Philippines, and
doubted the wisdom of their permanent occupation, Mr.
Hearst was telling how Jeffers'on would have, stuffed
them in Uncle Sam's pocket, and Mr. Bryan was coaching
Democratic Senators. to vote for their acquisition. What
followed, followed, and no man can yet say what our
permanent relation to those- islands is to be, except that
the people will never permit their incorporation into our
body politic. , â¢
So between Hearst and Hogg, Parker and Hill the
whole Democratic- situation suggests the muddle that will
muss the affairs of the country if that party take control.

It may not be generally known that
Petrarch (1304-1374) was a collector of
ancient coins. It is said that, .during
his sojourn in Rome peasants would
bring him old coins, and that he would
decipher, the names of thei different em
perors engraved upon them. Petrarch
presented his collection to the Emperor
Charles IV, the first of the many
Kings addicted to the study of ancient
coins, the next century King Alfon
so V of Aragon (1442-1458) used to car
ry about with him on his Journeys from
Spain to his kingdom of Naples and
Sicily his fine collection of Greek and
Roman coins, encased in an ivory cab
inet, and he often said that the sight
of those coins acted upon him as a pow
erful incentive to imitate the virtues
of' those whose names they bore. The
Emperor Maximilian I laid the founda
tion at Vienna of the Imperial numis
matic collection still preserved there.

laid over for one week the proposed
amended ordinance making It unlawful
to sell or buy pools or make books or
receive as principal or agent any bet
or wager whereby money is staked, or
pledged on horse races except within
the inclosure of the race track. The
amendment is designed to put a stop
to pool selling in cigar stores, the pro

present ordinance on the plea that the
money is not wagered in this city, but
is sent to Oakland.

chased for $210. Paybt expressed the
opinion that the city should riot be
compelled to pay for the music on the
same principle that a carpenter is not
paid for his tools when he does work.
It also developed that the music had
been purchased by Wright without con
sulting the Finance Committee. After
cutting the demand down to $210 the
committee informed Wright that he
must appear before the committee in

music. .

ly submit plans and estimates of cost.
The. matter is now in the hands of a
special committee, consisting, of the
Fire . Commissioners and Assistant
Chief Dougherty, to ascertain through
experts the cost of installing the sys
tem in the downtown district.
The proposed amendment to the
building ordinance to limit the height
of buildings in the lodging-house dis
trict" to three stories, which was rec
ommended by the Fire Department
as an additional fire precaution, was
laid over for two weeks.
The committee decided not to re
insure the Harbor Police station. Â¦
The cost of this work, exclusive of setting
the hydrants, will be close to $250,000. The
amount of pipe necessary has a length of six
teen miles. The revenue which you offer for
this permanent Investment is $1 per. hydrant
per month, or a total of $3840 per annum. This
will produce i 54-100 per cent per annum gross
revenue, while. In order to meet our annual
Interest and taxes and operating expenses per
taining to this investment, the Income should
be Â¥20,000 per annum continuously.
It is apparent, from these figrures, that the
company is not Justified in performing the work
requested upon the revenue offered. We have
already set' ten miles of pipe, and propose to
lay 1&.000 feet on Mason, Taylor and Shrader
streets, on which fUty-three hydrants will be
set. Before more hydrants are set on pipes
over eight inches in diameter larger sums for
setting than at present allowed should be
agreed upon.
The Spring Valley Water Company
filed a 'communication stating that it
would be unable to comply with the
recommendation of. the Chief Engi
neer of the Fire Department that
mains be laid for 320 additional fire
hydrants. The communication says:
The extension was agreed upon by
the Fire Commissioners and the Fire
Underwriters at a previous meeting
and the matter was discussed at a con
ference held just before the Board* of
Supervisors met. Formal recom
mendation for the extension of the
fire limits was then made by the Fire
Commissioners.
The recommendation of the joint
Fire and Finance Committee that the
fire limits be extended on a line 137:6
feet north of Pine street, from Stock
ton to the easterly line of "Van Ness
avenue, thence to Market. street; also
to . include the block bounded -by
Steuart, East, Howard and Folsom
streets, was adopted by the Board of
Supervisors yesterday. Ah ordinance
to that effect was passed to print by a
unanimous vote. .
The poundkeeper was immediately
notified, but on the arrival of the wagon
the docs, with the exception of four,
mysteriously disappeared. Upon search
by the poundman one dog was
found dead, chained to his kennel, and
several others lying around the hills.
Ohmeyer saj-s he knew nothing of the
dogs* condition and that he always
cared well for them.
When approac-hed by a newspaper
man Ohmeyer turned and ran through
the Ingle?ide track. After a chase of
over a mile he was overhauled and ad
mitted that he owed many people and
that he doos not know how he can pay
thorn.
The Donald McRae Company seized
the furniture.
Ohmeyer's troubles did not end with
the Sheriff's interference. Secretary
Holbrook of the Society for the Preven
tion of Cruelty to Animals got wind
ot a. story that a number of once val
uable dogs were being starved to death
end that others had already died from
the same cause. He notified Ohmeyer
one day last week that unless the ani
mals were Immediately cared for a
charge of cruelty would be placed
against him. Ohmeyer promised to look
efter them, but a second report reached
Holbrook Saturday evening that an
other dog had died and that twenty
more were roaming the hills near the
Ohmeyer resort practically starving.
Upon the arrival of the Deputy Sher
iffs yesterday afternoon Deputy Gal
land threw several pieces of fat that
were found In the kitchen at them.
They fought and tore at one another
in their eagerness to get at the food
end ate the rolled oats, sour milk and
vegetables that were found on the
place.
The furniture has not been paid for,
however, nor has the rent reached the
Sutro estate. Accordingly yesterday
afternoon a posse of Deputy Sheriffs
eeized the resort and it was not long
before the entire outfit of furniture and
utensils were piled in the street.
The cruel treatment and starvation
of a dozen or more blooded dops was
exposed when deputies from the Sher
iff's office attached the Forest restau
rant and saloon near the Ingleside race
track yesterday afternoon.
A- Ohmeyer, proprietor of the resort,
opened his place last January, with
the view to serving parties with elab
orate dinners and rare wines. From
the Donald MoRae Furniture Company
he got credit for an extensive assort
ment of chairs, tables and other dining
room appointments.

A permit was granted to the Lincoln
Athletic Club for an amateur exhibi
tion on April 15 and one to the Hayes
Valley Athletic Club for one on April
22 by the Board of Supervisors yester
day. Supervisor d'Ancona's motion
that the resolutions be indefinitely
postponed .was defeated, receiving only
five votes in its favor.
D'Ancona thought the board should
not grant any -Jppre permits to 'ama
teur clubs in view of the fact that
evidence had; been; adduced that they
did not give genuine amateur contests.
Boxtori said that while he was opposed
to granting the -permits he had con
sented In the Police Committee to the
resolutions 'Â¦ pending the Inquiry into
the charges of the Pacific Amateur
Athletic Association that the two clubs
had violated the amateur rules. .Box
ton said he did not think the clubs
would give their shows anyhow, ; be
cause the pugilists had formed a union
and would ~ not appear unless bigger
purses were offered. .
The San Francisco /Athletic Club
was granted the May permit for a pro
fessional boxing exhibition.

heart failure yesterday and came
within a few beats of cheating the
penitentiary of one of its own. When
the prisoner fainted it was supposed
at first that he was preparing the way
for one of the counterfeit fits with
which during a previous residence at
the Sheriff's hostelry he faked his way
to many an indulgence. ;
He remained unconscious, however,
and the Harbor Hospital was notified.
Surgeon Millar responded to the^call
and found that Cooper," who really has
a weak heart, says the doctor,' had
been overcome by the Intense heat.
Under the ' medico's directions the
prisoner was removed from his sun
baked cell to a cooler part of the jail,
where he soon recovered conscious

within a year. He said he had lost
his temper and had punished the boy
too severely. \
The boy states that Conrad had
whipped him Thursday evening with
the butt end of a bugxy whip. He
had been left at home while Mr. and
Mrs. Conrad came to town, and de
clares that because he had gone to a
neighboring house to play he was
beaten.

back, which showed he had been se
verely beaten with some blunt instru

bruised with red welts as broad as a

being broken. There were also some
blue and black spots.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
its inability to meet the demand f6r
email bills, owing to the manner in
which present law limits their issu
ance, is sought to be remedied by the
removal of these limitations. On this
pcint the report says:
"It is probably true that the inability
nf the treasury to meet the demand
for small bills, combined with the
shortage in subsidiary coin in recent
years, has compelled the retention of
small bills in circulation until much of
that form of money has become ragged
and filthy and produced conditions
â¢which have fully justified the vigorous
crusade for 'clean money/ which has
been recently inaugurated. It is be-
Jieved, however, that with the large
discretion given to the treasury and
the national banks under the provi
sions of this bill, supplemented by an
abundant supply of subsidiary coin,
much of the cause for complaint will
be removed.
"An ideal sanitary currency, how
ever, can be secured only by the sub-
Ftitution of subsidiary coin for all one
and two dollar bills and improved
methods of redemption for paper money
of denominations "of J5 and upward."
The coinage of silver dollars into sub
sidiary silver coins is provided in the
jhird section of the bill. The limit of
5100.000,000 as the total amount of sub
sidiary silver ooiiis that can be in exist
ence at an}' one time is repealed by
this section. y
The report says that on July 1 next
the bullion from which subsidiary coins
may be made -will be exhausted. There
jf in the treasury 578.012,099 silver dol
lars, or. says the report, according to
Hccretary Shaw, C>00 carloads of thirty
ions rach. It would cost $100,000 to re
count this money, and the Secretary
says that It is worth Jn bullion less
than half of its face value In dollars.
It is this money that the bill proposes
to recoin into subsidiary silver as rap
idly as the Secretary shall order. In
i his recoinace there is estimated a pro
lit to the Government of 7 cents on
each dollar.
Relief to the Treasury Department in
WASHINGTON. April U-â A report
troia the House Committee on Banking
end Currency, recocaendins the pas
rage of the bSll "to laiprore currency
conditions," tras filed in the HousÂ« to
day by Chairman Fo-vcler. The first
section of the bill repeals the Uw -which
prohibits customs receipts from being
deposited in national' banfcs. The rÂ«
sult of the present law, the report says,
is unnecessarily to tie up the money of
the country. The report says that If
States and municipalities should lock
up the proceeds of their local taxation,
bi the national Government locks up
its receipts, the effect would be disas
trous, and yet there is as much reason
fur such a course in the one case as in
the other.
The second ! section repeals the
monthly $3,000,000 limit on bank note
retirement. The report says the repeal
of this restriction wiy give to the no
lional bank note circulation all of the
elasticity which it Is possible for a
l"Â»nd -secured circulation to hare.

ing to meet Jack Johnson, Billy Woods
or any other gladiator in the country.
Walcott weighed 160 pounds in his
street clothes last night.
Biddy Bishop. Jimmy Coffroth. Bil
ly Roach and Eddie Graney were clos
eted with the little typhoon from' Bos
ton for several hours last night in
Harry Corbett's. It was lonsr after
midnight when the match with the
Dixie Kid for championship honors
was finally arranged.
The men will weigh in at 6 o'clock at
142 pounds and the pursÂ« will be di
vided on the basis of 65 per cent to.
the winner and 35 per cent to the loser.
Walcott sat behind a formidable ar
ray of diamonds, watch chains and
flashing shirt studs, and thus barri
caded,- declared, that he was entitled
to about 10 per cent of the gate re
ceipts and all of the purse, but was
finally persuaded to moderate his de*
mands.
Biddy Bishop strained every nerve
to clinch the match with Billy "Woods,
but the champion evidently thinks the
Kid is easier money. When Bishop
offered him more than 50 per cent to
fight in Oakland, Walcott pulled out
a railroad ticket and said:
"Coffroth here paid my transporta
tion, and if possible I want to give
him the first chance, but the man that
offers the best inducements gets the
match." v\
After considerable haggling and
dispute over the division of the gate
receipts and purse. Joe Walcott was
last night matched to meet the Dixie
Kid -before the Colma Club on the
30th of this month. ":'%"-

TEXT OF THE MEASURE
SOCIETY TOPAETICIPATE
Joe Jones, "Big Bill" Knapp and Jed
Lewis are the best: riders at Oakland,
and can be relied upon to do their best.
Bonner spent a great day in the sad
dle. In different races he fell off Sir
Dougal,*Red Bird and Clausus.
Although all the stakes were declared
off Worth track will give $500 purses
and liberal overnight handicaps.
The track bar was closed, as it was
election day in Emeryville.
Perhaps Titus was best of those
starting in the fifth event. Dan Meek's
sprinter was heavily backed at juicy
odds to do the trick, and he led from
start to finish. My Surprise, the 7 to 5
favorite, acted badly at the post and
was the recipient of ridiculous hand
ling at the hands of Bonner, running
unplaced. Wager, a Los Angeles vis
itor,and 12 to 1, took the place from
Nullah.
XOTES OF THE '-.TRACK.
Six to five was accepted about Kitty
Kelly in the betting on the mile and
fifty-yard run, and with Bonner up the
mare won all the way. Anirad was al
ways the runner up, beating out Isa
bellita, a 25 to 1 outsider, for place
honors. Ada N warmed up sore and
Wright handled her to no'advantage.
Vasallo fared poorly when it came to
racing luck or he might have been a
contender.
Joe Jones next put Cotati, a 20 to 1
shot, over the plate, winner of the five
and a half furlong scramble'for maiden
three-year-olds. It was a hand-me
down bunch and Cotati lasted long
enough to beat Wistaria a head. Brown
Patsy ran third and the favorite, Friv
olous, fifth.
"Big Bill" Knapp, with one bullseye
to hl3 credit, startled the crowd at Oak
land track yesterday by landing Lady
Kent, a 60 to 1 shot, first for the final
event of the, day. It would not have
created such a sensation but for the
fact that Mlsty's -fcride had first call
In the ring at 13 to 10 and was con
sidered invincible. The Oregon bred
mare showed signs of soreness going
to the post, -but this - was forgotten
when the barrier flew In the air. She
set a dazzling clip, Knapp managing,
however, to keep within hailing dis
tance with Lady Kent, though the
other starters were sadly outfooted.
Approaching the wire the favorite be
gan displaying signs of fatigue and
it was then easy for Knapp to outride
Sherwood, earning the decision with
the despised outsider by a neck. The
time, 1:12%, was dangerously close to
the Coast record for' six furlongs.
Criss Cross ran a distant thirdr
It was a rare inning for long shots,
for Harka and Kitty Kelly were the
only winning favorites. A dollar par
layed on Lurene, Cotati, Titus and
Lady Kent would have netted a small
fortune. The attendance was large.
As Holbrook, the stable rider, was
given a vacation last week by Starter
Holtman, Otis had the mount on Harka
in the opening event. The filly was
backed down in the betting from 2% to
1 to 2 to 2 favoritism, and came home
a head before the 30 to 1 outsider Facts.
Targette, as usual, ran well for five
furlongs, then closed up and finished
third. Red Bird had plenty of. Bpeed,
but was miserably ridden by Bonner.
A hundred and one different tips
were circulated on the Futurity course
sprint following, which wore a decid
edly open look. Steph, ridden by Sher
wood and backed down to 18 to 6, had
an undeniable chance, but bolted at
the start and was left At the last mo
ment Lurene, with Roach in the' sad
dle, was hammered down from 10 to 6
and in a hard drive led Alice Carey
over the line a head. Joe Jones fin
ished third on Priestlike. Ballroom
Belle, which opened favorite, ran a
very poor race.

It was the sudden increase of solar
heat, Mary Campbell asserted, that af
fected her limbs so that 'she was un
able to walk straight, and also im
peded her speech so that she could" not
tell Policeman Nelson where. she dwelt.
Then the policeman took the witness
stand and said that Mary was afflicted
with acute alcoholism when he picked
her up, and he also showed proof that
she was an .old hand at that line of
misdemeanor.^ Three months was the
sentence handed to Mary by Judge Mo
gan. '
"Why did he strike you?" asked
Judge Mogan.

he said that I said I never saidâ"

One inflamed. eye in a somber set

he was violently assaulted by Frank

"Because she wants to elope with my
son Johnny and has some of his clothes
in her trunk," was the answer.
"I don't know her son Johnny, but
she is in love with my husband and is
mad because I'm prosecuting him,"
Mrs. Johnson declared.
Before the defendant could choke
down her wrath sufficiently to permit
of utterance she was pronounced guilty
and hastily removed.
she glared angrily at her fragile look

as she sat in the dock.
"Why did you strike this woman?"
Inquired the Judge.
Comparing the decade of 1884-1893
with the last decade, 1894-1903, the
Health Department bulletin shows a
decrease of 40.2 per cent in the deaths
per 1000 of population from all forms
of nervous diseases and of 59.8 per
cent in the deaths from convulsions.
CHICAGO, April 11. â A notable de
crease in the percentage of local
deaths from nervous diseases suggests
to the Health Department that the
high tension of life in Chicago is being
lowered and that the people are re
turning to saner and simpler modes of
living than obtained in the two strenu
ous, nerve-shocking decades following
the great fire of 1871. In the same
connection it Is noted that the deaths
of babies from convulsions have de
creased nearly 60 per cent.

after eight hours' fighting, and the
enemy was driven back on .all sides.
The chief forces apparently retired In

then asked John why he did not ab

he knew that it* would lead him to

March Him was arrested because he
had In his possession five copies of as
many drawings in a Cninese lottery;
and the Judge said the police had no
more right to take the man into, cus
tody than Ithey would have to imprison
a white man caught reading a news
paper containing the result of a draw
ing pf the Mexican lottery.
"It Is by bringing in such cases as
this," his 'Honor declared, "that the
police convey to the Grand Jury an idea
that they are not encouraged by thu
magistrates to perform their duty."
Judge Mogan dismissed March jHim,
accused of aiding and. acetting a lot
tery, and incidentally conveyed a hint
to Police Sergeant Christensen concern
ing the futility of making arrests with
out having evidence sufficient to justify
conviction.
For keeping a lottery place at 121
Geary street George Lewis was fined
$100 by Judge Mogan and the municipal
treasury was at once enriched to that
amount.
Judge Mogan heard a portion of Com
plainant Kenney's side of the case yes
terday and will hear some more of it
next Wednesday.
While returning from lodge at an
early hour Sunday morning William
Kenney found it convenient -to travel
through an alley upon which abuts the
rear of a boarding-house, whose front
is numbered 148 on Fifth street. The
rays of the soft and fulsome moon that
bathed the firmament with glory
failed to illuminate the cobble pave
ment over which Mr. Kenney toiled
with uncertain steps, and when he
fell over an empty packing case and
awoke the echoes he barked his shins
and howled his anguish.
The clatter and the cry awakened
Nestor J. Espinosa, a son of Castile,
who occupied'one of the back rooms of
148 Fifth street, and burglars was his
first imagining. Grasping a trusty
sword cane he sprang to his window
and gallantly prepared to protect nis
property at* the cost of his life, If needs
be. Mr. Kenney was endeavoring to
extricate ' himself from the wreck of
the box and interspersing his struggles
with profane outbursts, when his head
was sharply smitten with the sword
cane in the firm hand of Senor Espi
nosa, who still labored under the de
lusion that he was protecting somebody
or something. He, too, uttered curse
words as he swung his weapon, and
when William Smith, also of 148 Fifth,
rushed into the alley he found -the
atmosphere of bluish tinge. Mr. Smith
also contributed to the battery of Mr.
Kenney, and it is believed that other
boarders that subsequently arrived did
likewise. At any rate Mr. Kenney's
head was cut and' bleeding and he was
in a generally usedup condition when
the police appeared. Espinosa and
Smith were the only persons arrested,
however, ihe former for carrying a
deadly weapon and the latter for bat
tery.

The young woman in the^ case did

conduct.
While sauntering f along "Mission

urday evening Herbert Wilt was
breathing soft nothings and relishing
their effect upon his fair companion
when he suddenly heard her character
assailed by a masculine voice heavily
laden with anger. Turning around, he

the man that struck the blow that may
prove fatal was taken to jail.
In the court of Judge Mogan yester

Says That No Board Should
Be Created Which Would
Usurp the Chiefs Powers
MEASURE UNNECESSARY
As the Head Is Responsible
to the Country He Believes
He Should Be the Master
WASHINGTON, April 11.â Secretary
Moody is not in favor of the creation
of a general staff in the navy modeled
after the general staff organization in
the army. This fact he communicated
to the House Committee on Naval Af
fairs to-day In a hearing granted him
on a bill of his own drafting "to In
crease the efficiency of the navy."
The bill authorizes the Secretary of
the Navy to constitute a general board
in his discretion, by detailing seven
officers on the active list of the navy
and marine corps not below the rank
of captain, for such duties as the Sec
retary may from time to time direct.
The Secretary explained that this bill
did hot really enlarge his present au
thority in the matter of an advisory
board. He now has the right to create
such a board of any number of officers
and continue them on the board for any
length of time. t\
Such a board, the Secretary explains,
was absolutely "in the hollow of the
hands of the Secretary of the Navy."
He could create it at will and discon
tinue it at wilL Its functions would
be purely advisory. He said that a
civilian would always be at the head
of the navy and that it was proper he
should have expert advice, but as he
was responsible to the country he
should be master of the situation. No
board, he said, should be created which
would usurp the powers of the Secre
tary. The board provided for in his
bill, he said, would have no executive
power nor jurisdiction over the bureau
of the navy-
The committee took no action on the
bill, which has not yet been Introduced
in Congress.

It was Judge Conlan who found -a
way. out of the embarrassment into
which his court and half a dozen of
the stellar legal minds attached to the
Hall of Justice were plunged by the
extraordinary attitude of Edward Cof
fey, self-accused of peace disturbance.
Mr. Coffey had arrested himself and
then appeared as complainant and de
fendant and eloquently pleaded both
sides of his case.
"In a Clay street restaurant la,st Sat
urday afternoon,", said Coffey, the ac
cuser, "I ate chile concarne and ice
cream, for which I was unabje, on ac
count of poverty, to pay. Â¦ The pro
prietor of the establishment addressed
Borne insulting language to me and in
retaliation I picked up a chair, threw
it at him and walked out. That's the
case for the prosecution, your Honor,
and I claim that the testimony you
have heard Is sufficient to convict me
of disturbing the peace."
The. Judge bowed concurrence. Then
spake Coffey the defendant:
"I ask for leniency, your Honor, and
for this reason. \ After walking out of
the restaurant I could have escaped
punishment for what I had done, but
instead I looked around in search of a
policeman. There was no officer in
sight, nor did I see one until I arrived
at the Central Police Station and gave
myself into custody for disturbing the
peace. The fact that I acted as my
own policeman will, I hope, be taken
into consideration by this court. The
defense is in, your Honor, and I ask for
dismissal on the ground that I have
already received punishment ample to
fit my offense. Thirty-six hours have
I spent in durance."
"Your self-arrest and the consequent
imprisonment will not be ignored by
me as completely as you' have over
looked some other things you did in
connection with your confessed dis
turbance of the peace," responded the
Judge, with full gravity. "For in
stance, you disturbed your stomach by
loading it with a mixture of chile con
carne and Ice cream; but I presume
your digestion has paid painful penal
ty for that outrage. Then you de
frauded an inn keeper out of the price
of your Incongruous repast. Afterward
you deliberately impersonated a police
officer by placing yourself under arrest.
These unrecorded offenses serve to off
set other circumstances of a mitiga
tory character. You must do another
twenty-four hours upstairs."
"If you ever catch me breaking into
jail again I hope you'll never let me
out," Mr. Coffey ejaculated, and there
was bitterness In his tone.

ITS WONDERFUL OCCULT ANALYSIS AS
IT IS FOR ITS ORIGINAL EXPRESSION I

of little value when the mind is troubledâ-

after leaving Yokohama for this port.
All hands were saved and reached the
Japanese coast in the lifeboats. No

reached this port and the news of her
having been lost will come , as Â»a sur
prise to the local shipping world, which
for some days has been speculating on
the reason for r the , barkentine' s a'p
parently :Â¦ long voyage.
The; Bering was a vessel of peculiar
appearance and very 'familiar at this
port. She was built of steel, had lit
tle, beam' and was reported Â¦ cranky i in
bad weather. She was a vessel, of 877
tons register and was built In 1894 at
Inverkeithing. She was owned ; at St.

little success to-day. The marking up of

the hesitation of th<Â» market wuc due in part
to the pending hearing at St. Paul to-morrow
of the motion to enjo;n the pro rata distribution

CHICAGO. April 11. â Alarming reports of
damage to the growing grain in the Southwest
caused firmnrss here to-day In the wheat pit.
Compared with Saturday's close, final figures
to-day are >,4c hither on July. Corn and oats
arÂ» carh Oown \' t c, and provisions 7Uc to 22c.
Sentimtnt in wheat at the openinp was
bearish, Â©wine to a number of Influences In
the general situation. Among thÂ» factors were
liberal world's shipments, a considerable In
crease in the amcunt on passage, warmer
weather and lower Liverpool cables. In spite
of the bear factors, however, .Initial quotations
showed only Klltrht losses from Saturday's
final â¢flfnires. July bMnj; a shade higher to \\c
lower. "at 86tiCfSGÂ»Â»c to Kfl%c. Uncertainty as
to the character of the Government cron re
port, issHied later in tre day, restricted trading
to a considerable extent, and was perhaps the
main Influence early in supporting th? market.
Tovard the end of the first hour a firmer
feeling developed. The change was due largely
to precautionary covering of early sales, th*
t eaton being fear of a possible disappointment
to bears from official figures on the condition
of the crop. From SOHc July advanced to S7
Â®S7^ic. Reports by a prominent trader who
had Just returned from a trip through the
Southwest had perhaps moet to do with the
improved sentiment manifested during thÂ« lat
ter part of the session. According to that au
thority, win at losses In "Oklahoma, Kansas and
Nebraska were .much more serious than the
majority oT trader* realized. There was- a good

The hot wave Is playing havoc with Butter.
The fanciest creameries, which ordinarily bring
extreme top. prices, are coming in soft and out
of shape, and in this respect at least are* no
better th?n much inferior brands. Quotations
are consequently difficult to give, and the only
thing to be said in thi3 % connection is that if
Butter is hard and firm' it will bring the quo
tation*, below, and if it is soft and out of shape
it will not. In other words, nrecious little
Butter Is bringing the quotations. - The market
is none too firm at best, as receipts are heavy
and the demand slow.
There Is nothing new in the Cheese situation.
The fÂ«*ture of the- Egg market now is the
incrcacins weakness In store descriptions. This
hot weather will probably make a wider gap
between them and ranch hereatter. j They have
had a remarkable run thus far this season, and
many times have brought about as much as
the bfst ranch, but this condition is now about
over. Hct weather is death on a store Egg.
Ranch Eggs are still quoted steady and there
is no disposition on t!*.e part of dealers to sell
them any lower at present.
Receipts were 59, (iCo lbs Butter, 1544 cases

At the Central Theater Owen Davis'
romantic melodrama, "In the Hands of
the Enemy," gavÂ« a big audience, the
full measure of thrill and excitement
last night and Incidentally furnished a
generous amount of amusing comedy.
The scenes of the play are laid In Bo
livia, ahd the plot deals with the
scheme of a brace of villains, to wrest
from a young American gold .miner
the fruits of his rich discoveries. An
English adventurer is at the bottom
of the design, and he is abetted by
a Bolivian Chief of Police. The Ameri
can is flung into prison on a trumped
up charge, but with the aid of the
daughter of a United States Consul
he escapes in a sensational manner.
He is tracked to an abandoned mon
astery, where he has taken j refuge,
and a battle, ensues. The American, of
course, comes off victor, and naturally
weds the girl that saved him. Herschel
Mayall is the American, and Miss
Lawton the ; heroic daughter .of the
Consul, while Henry' Shumer is g the
wicked Chief ' of Police, George ' Nich

AUDIENCE APPRECIATIVE.
The 3000 people that attended the
McKinnon memorial fund entertain
ment at the Mechanics* Pavilion last
evening enjoyed a splendid concert by
the Filipino band, a good exhibition
of athletics by the Olympic Club
Â¦wrestlers and boxers and the best dls-
Silay of drill work Major Frank de L.
Carrlngton's battalion of Philippine
scouts has given since its arrival in
San Francisco. The entertainment
was held under the direction of the
First Regiment, National Guard of
California, and concluded with danc
ing, for which the music was furnish
ed by the band of that regiment.
â¢ In the boxing contests the following

and Ed Anstell. The boxing contests
were refereed by Jimmy Britt. * John G.
Gleason, athletic director of the Olym
pic Club, had the exhibition in hand.
The physical drill with rifles to music
by the band presented a taking exhibi
tion of difficult calisthenic work, in
which all four of the companies partici
pated. Finally the dress parade
brought nearly every spectator to his
feet in silent admiration of its impres
sive dignity, and as the __ well-ordered
ranks marched off the floor they were
followed by loud cheers.

Olympic Club brought out some excel

drill that. brought round after round of
applause from - the benches, the sixty
men moving in with machine-like pre
cision'and presenting a most effective
appearance. The VIsayan company
followed with an exhibition of skirmish
drill and volley firing that gave the
spectators a hint of the actual duties
performed by the fifty companies of
native scouts organized by UnclelSam's
officers In the Philippines.
Both bodies held meetings last
night, I but .their deliberations were
executive.- Â¦ The Stablemen's Union
will . submit, its conclusions to the
executive committee of the same be
fore taking definite action.
In any event nothing positive will
be done before the next meeting of the
union, which will be. held on Monday
night. â¢ It is rumored that the stable
men's association is determined to
fight the issue to a finish at this time.
Should both sides remain ob.durate it
is possible that other labor elements
may be dragged into the issue, as it Is
freely circulated that the Citizens'
Alliance is prompting the stablemen's
association to declare for a free and
open labor market to : all that may
wish to work. On the other hand the
Stablemen's Union will look to the
Hackmen's Union and other organiza
tions for sympathy should the fight
open.
There is g. great probability of a
clash between the Livery Stablemen's
Association and the Stablemen's Union
over the latest demand made by the
/union men which they ask be put into
operation on the 14 th inst.
The stablemen have asked for a
raise of 25 cents a day on their wages
.with other minor considerations. The
association is disposed to rebel against
any further concession or parleying
with the employes, who. it is said,
have succeeded in getting everything
they have asked for up to the present
time. . - â¢
livery Stablemen's Association and
Stablemen's Union Are Xearing
a Struggle.
CliASH IS IMMIXEXT.
The report received by the managers
of the California Street and Union
Street Cable companies Friday after
noon to the effect that the employes
of those, companies -were preparing to
submit demands for an increase of
wages has not yet been confirmed, al
though the men on the two lines free
ly discuss with their friends their con
templated move in that direction in
the near future.
Representatives of the Carmen's
Union and the United Railroads were
in conference for several hours yes
terday, but at the end of their meeting
it .was stated by both sides that no
definite understanding had been ar
rived at regarding existing troubles.
Though General Manager Chapman
and President Cornelius both - ex
pressed the hope that the differences
between their respective interests
would be amicably settled, there is still
a strong Undercurrent of feeling that
a strike is inevitable. Everything in
dicates that the company is 'deter
mined to make no further advances
in its wage schedule and it has so an
nounced on several occasions lately.
THe* men have shown no inclination,
however, .to abandon their hope of
forcing their employers to meet the
demands incorporated' in their recent
communication to the company.
It was stated on good authority yes
terday that the railroad company's
action in ceasing to break in more
"students" on the various lines after a
protest had been made by the carmen,
was only a temporary move and that
in a few days the management would
continue to instruct new men as It has
been doing for several months. This
move, it is expected, .will precipitate
matters, notwithstanding the declara
tion lately made that both fides would
stand by the existing agreement until
its expiration on April 30. It is" held
by members of the union that any,
trouble arising out, of the employment'
of extra men will be treated as a mat
ter entirely foreign to the provisions of
the agreement and that if the com
pany persists in breaking in new men
on the eve of the expiration of this
agreement such an act will be accepted
only in the light of an indication of
the company's determination to have,
no further peaceful arrangement with
the union.
a counter claim had been filed by Lena
Walton. Although she is reported to
have known al! the circumstances of
the case, she said she had the right
to enter a counter claim on the ground
ihat a soldier of the Government had
no right to locate a piece of ground.
This plea not holding good, she entered
a second suit, claiming that Captain
Walker had not done his assessment
work. In the parly part of the pro
ceedings she had the help and assist
ance of Jerry Wilson, a well known at
torney in that section. Failing in her
first endeavors, she brought suit a
third time, and in this instance she had
the assistance of Major L. H. French.
The case was tried in Nome in 1902,
before Judge Wickersham and she was
again defeated.
After, the trial French offered to sell
any equity that he and Lena Walton
had in the claim toÂ«the defendants for
S90Q0. The'' offer was refused. About
this time Lena Walton and Lane had
a personal encounter in a drugstore in
Nome, to which full publicity was given
through the press.
In 1903 the case was brought before
the Circuit Court of Appeals in this
c'ty and Judge Morrow, presiding, de
cided in favor of the Wild Goose Com
pany.
In 1903 the contestants. Lena Walton
and French, carried the case to the
Supreme Court of the United States,
?r.deavoring to obtain a writ of cer
tiurari. The answer was handed down
yesterday denying the request, which
puts an end to the Ions: and hard
fr-ught battle for the possession of the
claim.
*Ehe story of the case is a* follows:
Early In 1Ki$ Captain WalkÂ«\ U. S.
A^ who was at that time stationed in
Alaska, located a claim on Ophir Creek
known as No. 19. The next year when
he was in Seattle he offered to sell the
cJaim for $1200 to C D. Lane, the
president of the Wild Goose Mining
Company. Ixuw declined to buy at
that figure, but later, after having
made a personal inspection of the
claim, he reported t^ Walker that his
company was in a position to enter
tain the purchase, and in 1901 Walker,
then in Seattle, sold his rights to the
Wild Goose Company for $16,000.
When the ntw purchasers went to
Nome in the spring to begin develop
ing their new purchase they found that
This is undoabtedly the most noted
case that has ever been known in
the Nome section of Alaska. The prop
erty in Question was claim IS on Ophir
Creek. The controversy has been
going on since 1S9S. and has occupied
the attention of the courts in Alaska,
this city and in Washington up to the
present time. The suit has been bit
terly fought on both sides, and has cost
the contending parties much money.
Splce has l>een added to the general
contention by personal encounters be
tween the {iriacJpals cm the opposite
sides of the ccÂ£Â£.
The celebrated Lena Walton suit
against the Wild Goose Mining Com
pany was decided to-day by the United
States Supreme Court in favor of the
defendant.
The get-up is clever in the extreme,
with its girlish coiffure, little rose
rtuck in the belt, simple blue gown, and
Mr?. Fiske with Ibsen's "Keep the
change" to the cabman she enters,
at once sets -the key to 'the character.
One laushs as she gayly tells Krog
stadt she forged the check, without
the slightest idea of her responsibility,
and as one felt her gradual awakening
to th<* realities about her, her growing
terror amid them, one felt inclined to
say with the man behind, "Poor kid."
Throughout her Nora is as pointedly
clever, as subtle, as compellingly con
vincing as anything Mrs. Fiske has
done here and should not by any means
be missed.
Mr. Bosworth does a very sincere
and effective Krogstadt and Belle Bohm
*"A Doll's House," a new comedy In
thre* acts by Hendrlk Ibsen, affords
this week Hhe last gllrnpae of the
srason of Mrs. Flske In her variety.
The play aJso affords Max JFlfrman his
best opportunity of the* engagement as
Ton-aid Helmer.
One does not need to ask here what
Ibsen Is driving: at- Unlike, as In the
motionless art of "Hedda Gabler,"
serenely unne^dful of any ralson d'etre
save Its truth, pure and purposeless,
the playwright Is distinctly preaching
in "A Doll's House." And one does not
need to ask here what Ibsen is driving
at simply because every one can find
an answer to Ms taste â and each prob
ably different. Those bitten with the
heredity bee doubtless take It that
Ibsen is once again preaching:, as In
"Ghosts." that the sins of the fathers
descend upon the children. The pro
taÂ£onists> of the environment theory
will point to Xora Helmer's up-bringing
by the serT&nts as evidence that the
playwright Is preaching the effect of
environment uj>on character. The in
dividualist, the new woman, any one.
in fact, can take a fling at a moral and
bring one down to his entire satisfac
tion. Meantime Ibsen paints away at
his characters, truth upon truth, light
upon light, and at the last, as in life,
one is left questioning.
Mrs. Piske as the child-wife, Xora
Helmer, who lies with equal readiness
about a macaroon or a forged check,
and Max Figman as the husband, who
sublimely assumes to be Nora's "will
and conscience," engage easily the
sympathies of the audience. Mr. Fig
man gives a pleasantly human quality
to the character of Helmer. Cad as he
is later found to be, and superb ego
tist always, one is made to feel that
with his small spiritual charge Helmer
pays u? as much as be could be ex
pected to â¢ pay. One foresees, indeed,
for him in his last illuminative words.
"A miracle." a new -and wiser Helmer
to meet some day the new Nora, grown
to woman's stature. Mr. Figman's
scene where he discovers that Nora
has forged the check is an admirable
bit of bourgeois exposition, and the
â¢whole impersonation splendidly con
sistent and convincing.
Mrs. Fiske "did" a child-wife last
week, the sprightly Cyprienne of "Di
vorcons," who. it will be remembered,
deceives her husband with . easy flu
ency. Nothing perhaps could be mofe
characteristic of the subtlety of Mrs.
Flske's genius than the deft fashion In
which she differentiates the superficial
tarradiddling of Cyprienne from the
essential deceitfulness of Nora's make
up. Nora lies as a child lies, because
she is still a child. Denied instruc
tion in the ways of truth by her father,
himself "of morals not inpeccable." and
kept in spiritual and mental subjection
by her husband, she has never learned
the lesson of responsibility. And it is
all there, the childishness, the weak
ness, the glib falsity. In every* clever
note of Mrs! Fiske's voice. In the shift
iness of the eyes, in her whole sugges
tion.
