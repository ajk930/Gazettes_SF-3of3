"Win S. Green, editor of the Colusa Sua

men. and :wjJitical leaders of Canruriiia.
died, yesterday afternoon at St. Luke"s
Hospiial cf sastro enteritis. The illness
that" caused his death seised him only a
â¢ few Uays ago. and he was taken to St.
Luke's to undergo an operation. He failed
rapidly, however, and passed away yes
terday afternoon. His wife and children
were at his bedside when the .end came.
â¢ a newspaper man and a political
leader Mr. Greon was absolutely tearless.
'Even his stror.gesi opponents admired
his integrity. He was considered the
greatest authority in California on irri
gation and much of his time was given to
a study of this subject. He was also well
known as a writer of essays and short
clones.
William Semple Green was born in
Wayne County. Kentucky. December 28,
2832. He left his native State for Cali
fornia in 1849 by the way ol Panama on
the steamer California, and arriving here
settled lv Benicia. At the same* time he
had charge of the steam ferry-boat Micy
Ixshg piying the Straits of Carquinez.
â¢ w Xn Juiy, 1850. he went to Colusa and
helped lay out the town. His early edu
cation consisted of a few months in the
old field schools of the backwoods of
Kentucky. After arriving in California
he "spent . all his leisure in reading and
studying, and the place he filled as one
of tne leading newspaper men of Cali
fornia was due to his own efforts. He
was> in 'every sense a. golf -made man. The
first-five years here were spent in freight
ing, farming and hotel keeping.
In- 1557 he was elected County Surveyor,
which ortiee he held for ten years. His
first newspaper work was in 1555, when
he began writing stories and essays for
the Golden Era, California Farmer and
<xher papers. The Sun, which had been
started in ls>i>2 by C. R. Street, was pur
chased by J. c. Addington and Mr. Green
in IS&J, when he began his editorial career
.amid, the exciting scenes of the Civil
â¢War." He maintained ultra State rights
tinctrines. He wrote as he believed, with
out regard to consequences. Hence the
Sun became a conspicuous mark for op
l>ortr.g journals. In 1567 Mr. Greeen rep
, K.sVmed Colusu and Tehaau counties in
-the Assembly. He was Surveyor General
t;f California in ISS3 and State Treasurer
in IKk. In ISS2 he married Miss Jcsephlm

sult of this union, five of whom survive
him. Mrs. Zoe Radcliff of Oakland. Mrs.

came. The funeral will take place from
the Catholic Church, Colusa, at 3 p. m.
to-morrow.
COLCSA. July 2.â The news of the
'death of Will S. Green was a great shock
to his friends and neighbors and fellow
townsmen generally. The ilags of all the
county and public buildings are at half
mast.
As a man, a husband father he was
held in universal esteem. Plain and un
pretentious of manner and bounding- In
human sympathy, he was essentially a
tnan of the people. He was a representa
tive California citizen with exalted ideas
of the obligations which citizenship im
poses. He was a man to be trusted in
any emergency. He was unfaltering In
â¢ his loyalty to any cause he espoused and
was firm to faultlness in his friendships.
Ho stood squarely upon his merits as a
rtan and citizen in all the actions of his
life.

UNITE AGAINST
THE MORMONS
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SALT LAKE, July 2,-Centiles who
desire Â£o secure good homes in the Uintah
Indian' reservation, to be opened in Sep
tember, will be offered special induce
ments to take part in the drawing for
lands on the reservation by. an organiza
tion of non-Mormons; formed for the pur
pose of defeating the Mormon church
scheme to secure the desirable sites in
the reservation. A letter has been- sent
out under the direction of the first presi
dency to the lesser officials of the church,
instructing them to organize all the
young Mormons In the various wards for
the purpose of getting hold of the choice
lands of the reservation. One sentence
of the letter reads:
"We are acquainting ourselves with
tracts of land I which we feel are most
desirable for settlement and which,
through land office- connections being
termed by ua, can be chosen by those
who may be in touch with" us."
The publication of a copy of this let
ter here to-day aroused the gentiles, who
are preparing to open an information
bureau and begin a regular colonization
propaganda in opposition to the Mormon
plan. President Roosevelt will be asked
to issue Instructions that will make diffi
cult the carrying out of the Mormon
plan, while the non-Mormons will en
deavor to Induce gentiles to take part in
the drawinsr. \u25a0.:.;'.
The reservation contains about 2,600,000
acres, most of It good agricultural land
and the remainder rich In coal, iron, as
phaltum, gold, silver, lead and copper.
It would easily support a population of
100,000 persons. The addition of 60,000. non-
Mormons to Utah's population wouid be
sufficient to wrest the State from the con
trol of the Mormon church, so that the
gentiles would be enabled to compete with
Mormons in business on equal terms,
which is not at present the case. ; >. . 1 ;â¢:
According to the present arrangements;
the drawing for lands in the reservation
will take place at the Vernar Land Office,
recently established through the efforts
of Senator. Smoot. This land office is a
long distance from the railroad and diffi
cult of access. It Is believed to have been
thus located to further the Mormon plan.
Don B. Coltoh. a Mormon. Is receiver,
and Charles de Moiey, a non-Mormon, is
register. Though nominally a * gentile,
De Molsy Is fully under the control of the
Mormon church. He comes rrom Smoot's
home town of Provo and. Is one of the
apostle-Senator's adherents. De Molsy
and Colton are the/ "land office connec
tions" referred to in the Mormon letter.
The officials of the Western, Federation
cf Miners have taken the matter up,'
actuated . In part by the fact that the
Mormon, church is conslderec a foe to or
ganized labor and^, in part by-a desire to
get their members established in a rich
mlniny field.
Citizens of Grand Junction, Colo., are
trying to persuade President Roosevelt
to order the drawing to be held at
Grand Junction. In order to obstruct the
Mormons In the scheme. The members
of the Colorado Congressional delegation
have . promised to assist the people of
Grand Junction and will use their, influ
ences with the President to secure, the
desired change. /-.-V- - . - \u25a0 - -

CANAL GOVERNOR
MADE MINISTER
.OYSTER BAY. -July 2.-President
Roosevelt to-day authorized the an
nouncement that he had appointed
Charles K. Ma goon as United States Min
ister, to. Panama. Judge Magoon is at
present Governor of the canal zone . at
Panama 'and a r 'member ' of the executive
committee > ot 'the; \u25a0 Isthmian Canal Com
mission-. Prior to his appointment on' the
canal : commission,- he was *. the law offi
cer; of the -Insular affairs bureau of the
War: Department. He is in Panama 'at
present performing his' duties in conjunc
tion \u25a0 with the. canal work. â¢\u25a0 . :
The determination of the President to
have the'offlces of Governor of the canal
zone and Minister to Panama filled by
the same man . was decided upon soon
after the reorganization of the Isthmian
Canal Commission two or three, months
ago. Experience had demonstrated that a
conflict of authority was likely to arise
between the Governor, and Minister and
in addition confusion was created among
the Panamans, particularly the officials
of the republic, by the j presence of two
officers holding similar powers.
It was well known that George W. Da
vis, former Governor of the canal zone,
and John Barrett, until recently Minister
to Panama, did not pull well together, al
though there, was no open difficulty be
tween them. To avert any r possible trou
ble in the future that might be detrimen
tal to the interests' of this country or to
those of Panama in the construction of
the canal, the appointment of Judge Ma
goon to the two offices was determined
upon. It is known that the designation
of Judge. Mftgoon as Minister to Panama
In connection with his appointment as
Governor of the canal zone is notably
pleasing to the % officials and people of
Panama. ''?s*Â£â¢Â£\u25a0

The remonstrance Is based on the al

that he was an Oxford; graduate and a

-;By direction of the President Secre
tary Loeb made the formal announce
ment in. the following statement: ;;
"The President announces that the
Russian and Japanese Governments
have notified him -that they have ap
pointed plenipotentiaries to meet hero
(Washington) as soon after the first of
August as possible. The- two Russian
plenipotentiaries are Embassador : \u25a0 Mu-f
ravieff, formerly Minister of Justice
and -\ now Embassador at Rome, and
Embassador. t Rosen. The Japanese
plenipotentiaries \u25a0 are . Baron Komura;
now Minister' of ; Foreign Affairs, and
Minister \u25a0Ta.ka.hira. It is possible that
each side .may^ send one or: more addi
tional representatives. -.
'â¢The plenipotentiaries of -both Russia
and Japan will be j entrusted with full
power to negotiate and conclude a
treaty of peace, subject, of course, to
ratification by their respective home
Governments."
'A. day 'or two ago the Russian and
Japanese Governments .^formally com
municated to the President the names
of the plenipotentiaries they had se
lected, v Acting I . ; as an Intermediary the
President communicated the names of
the Japanese envoys to the St. Peters
burg Government and those of tho Rus
slon representatives to ..the. Government
at Tokio. Having received .from both
Governments assurances that'.the^selec
tions were satisfactory the President,
according to his agreement withy the
belligerents, authorized tho public ; an r
nouncement of the envoys..
JAPAN'S DEMAND IS MET.
Some delay waa occasioned in the se
lection of the plenipotentiaries by the in
sistence of Japan that the envoys of both
Governments be clothed with; full power
to conclude peace and to negotiate: a
permanent treaty. The Japanese Govern
ment indicated pointedly that the^ Em
peror would not permit his : envoys to en
ter upon a tentative conference in which
Jepan was to define, her .terms and then
let Russia decide whether the conferees
should proceed with their deliberations.
The Tokio Government insisted that the
plenipotentiaries should i have conferred
upon them treaty making powers and
that the negotiations should be entered
upon in a spirit of perfect sincerity.
1 Such, too, ' was : the position . taken by
President Roosevelt. ; He maintained that
only by clothing the envoys with ample
authority to act for their respective
Governments could a lasting peace be
achieved. .He strongly, urged the_ St.
Petersburg Government- to accede. to what
was regarded as a reasonable proposition
of. Japan.- That he was successful in his
presentation of 'the matter to "the Rus
sian Emperor is Indicated clearly in the
statement which he issued to-day. \u25a0 ' __
; The President's announcement- prac
tically / concluded the preliminary nego
tiations for peace. Minor details remain
yet to ;be arranged, but the : conference
now seems to be assured. While no abso
lute date for the I meeting of the envoys
has been fixed, it has been; determined
that: the first session will be held Jn
Washington about the first jof August.
ROSEN ALREADY ON THE WAY,
Baron. Rosen already Is, en route to the
United States, his coming being to suc
ceed Count Casslnl as the' Russian Em
bassador to : this , country. It Is probable
that" Embassador Muravteff^ will> start
soon for the United States, . accompanied
by a considerable -: staff of secretaries,
clerks and Interpreters. The Japanese
contingent of v' officials and,' ; attaches,
headed by Baron < Komura, it is expected,
will leave Japan' in 'tlmeHo reach Wash
ington by .the first of August. _ \u25a0
No decision 'has been reached yet as
to ; the place of holding .'. the 'sessions of
the : conference. For,' the purpose of or
ganization and to determine; upon plans
tor' 'the i future. \the plenipotentiaries ;, will
meet : in Washington. ; but , it \is regarded
as highly probable ; that "\u25a0 at . an early , date
thereafter they 3 . will .adjourn to hold the

SITUATION IS BLACKER
THAN DISPATCHES SHOW
London Does Not Credit Claim That the
Pobiedonosetz Has Surrendered.
LONDON, July 3.â The dispatches from
Sebastopoj. telling of the action of Vice
.Admiral Kruger, after a council of admi
rals and captains of the Black Sea fleet.
In ungearing his machinery and authoriz
ing: his officers and men lo go ashore, are
regarded by the London morning papers
as a full explanation of the mystery sur
:ounding the recent occurrences at Odes
sa. It is held tbat there is no longer any
doubt'that Russia Is confronted with se
rious disaffection In the remnant of her
navy and that this knowledge actuated
.Admiral Kruger in refraining from any
attempt to suppress tne mutiny on the
iÂ£maz Potemkine. The question is asked:
How far may the same state of affairs
exist- in the army, should occasion arise
to employ the troops against a serious in
ternal uprising?
Though for the moment the danger
threatening Odessa Itself has been avert
ed. It is considered that the situation
pould hardly be blacker. The history of
the past few daye inclines the public here
to regard with suspicion most of the re
ports emanating front Russia, and the
tendency is to believe that the conditions
at Odessa, L-ibau, Kronstadt and else
where are much worse than has been re
ported and no surprise will be expressed
should the alleged surrender of the
Georgi Pobiedonosetz turn out to be no
better founded than was the reported
surrender of the Kniaz Potemkine.

ture them. The local authorities spoke
with them and the boatswain, according
to the dispatch, declared that they de
sired to surrender and yield up four
ringleaders, adding that they had al
ready smashed tho breech-blocks of
the guns. Â«
After a. long parley and delay and
much unnecessary shouting on the part
of tht gendarmerie, three tugboats filled
with troops, armed with rifles and with
orders to shoot if the mutineers resist
ed, were about to start for the warship.
At that very minute a staff officer rush
ed up with orders from the commander
in chief telling them not to proceed.
CKEW DEMANDS FULL PARDON.
Soon afterward "the Governor General,
with 3000 troops, arrived and there was
more useless talking. Then a lighter
was sent alongside, but the members of
the crew of the battleship declined to
surrender, in fear of being shot, and
sent word they wanted pardon. Even
tually the Governor General went on
board and the sailors promised that
they would serve faithfully if the offi
cers returned, but that they would de
cline to quit the ship without the Em
peror's full pardon. The correspondent
says the sailors received a telegram
from their admiral, saying that if they
asked for pardon perhaps they would
not be punished.
In ( the meantime, the correspondent
says, the Kniaz Potemkine, 'having coal
ed, sailed away at full speed. -
According to other special dispatches
from Odessa, several of the officers of
the Georgi Pobiedonosetz were mur
dered.
The Kniaz Potemkine sent a - boat
ashore Saturday morning requesting
provisions and bandages, as the mem
bers of the crew, had been fighting
among themselves.
Other less reliable reports | say the
commander of the Georgi Pobiedonosetz
shot himself; that the mutineers sent a
message ashore, , addressed to the Em
peror, demanding: a constitution;" under
threats, and that the Governor General
ordered the troops to fire on an assem
blage of more than twenty persons.

ADMIRAL BLAMES AMEIUCAA 5.
Says Yankees and Englishmen Are Aid
* Ins the Revolutionists.
LIBAtJ, July 2.â Your " correspondent
saw Rear. Admiral Iretzkoy " to-day in
reference to "Wednesday's mutiny at tha
barracks among, the sailors under his
command. The admiral did his best to
minimize the extent of the outbreak, but
would speak little in detail. Ho asserted
that ' at breakfast on Thursday all tho
mutlners but forty-seven had returned ta
their barracks and of these only seven
teen are ' now missing. "While uncom
municative as to the facts of the -actual
outbreak, the admiral was eager to give
his views of the causes of the discontent.
"It is quite true," he, said, "that Eng
lish-American aid has been given to tho
Japanese and to the Russian revolution
ists. Especially is this so among the
sailors and disaffected workmen .In
Libau.* where the revolutionary party is
well organized, as It is elsewhere m
Russia."
"Inquiries from other sources show that
the revolutionary propaganda among tha
sailors has bÂ»en especially active since
defeat In the Sea of Japan, which. I am
Informed by naval officers, was celebrated
by champagne suppers at cafe chantanta.
Civilians said they were celebrating be
cause the defeat removed the prospect of
their being sent East. From this time
the sailors began â¢ the complaints about
the food, which was contrasted with tho
alleged riotous life of the officers.
"At 10 o'clock on "Wednesday the first
company of mutineers begem window
smashing and other disorders. An offi
cer commanding the guard ordered them
to disperse. Upon their refusal, he fired a
revolver, apparently wounding nobody.
The mob hurried :to the other barracks,
where the other companies Joined in. the
mutiny. The 3000 sailors, with the excep
tion of a few who took refuge- in tho
houses,, rifled^the armory and engaged in
a purposeless^ fusillade of several hours,
expending, it is is said, 40,000 cartridges."
SEWS* SURPRISES LOXDOX.
LONDON*. July 2.â A dispatch from
New York was the first intimation Lon
don had of the definite appointment of
the Itussian and Japanese delegates to
the peace conference - at, "Washington.
The news was communicated to the for
eign embassies and officials here, every
one expressing delight over the suc
cessful issue of President Roosevelt's
efforts.- 'i~jÂ£f\-':
They were surprised that tho dele
gates were empowered to- conclude \u25a0 a
treaty of peace. One diplomat "paid
that it was a great diplomatic achieve
ment and if President Roosevelt suc
ceeded kv Inducing both belligerents to
agree to-an armistice before another great
battle were fought his triumph would
be complete. â¢ He felt that the selection
of Baron Rosen as one of the delegates
was a happy choice, as the Japanese
have great respect for him- Tha
diplomat pointed out that at the break
ing off of diplomatic relations by Japan
and Russia the whole Japanese nation
expressed - its ; sympathy with Baron
Rosen, who was then Minister to Japan,
and"-during his progress through the
streets of Tokio, when he was leaving
for Russia, the people bared their heads
and stood In silence.
Some surprise is expressed here that
Marquis Ito was not appointed as one
of the delegates, but it is thought this
possibly was due to the belief that
Foreign Minister Komura and Minister
Takahlra-were better acquainted 'with
the present condition of affairs.
BATTLE MAY BE PREVENTED,
ST. PETERSBURG, July 3. â Negotia
tions for- an armistice between the
armies of Russia- and Japan. -It. can be
definitely stated, are now in progress,
presumably in "Washington, but they
have not reached a stage where any
further announcement can be made.
-The decision seems to rest with
Japan. whicn. country Is weighing the
relinqulshment.of .the prospects of bet
tering her present advantageous posi
tion, against th& enormous cost In lives
and money of another great battle.- i
The-chances for a decisive and final
Japanese victory, it is believed here,
are no better than before Liaoyans and
Mukden, and it Is pointed out that.it is
idle to talk of Vladivostok falling like
a ripe apple into Japanese hands be

POISON ED BY PTOMAINES
AT DINNER PARTY.
Five Women Seized
With Severe
Escape From Death
Hidden in Hood
Is Narrow;
OAKLAND, July 2.â Ptomaine poison
ing contained in canned soup or icecream
took five women to = the brink of the
grave last night, after a family dinner
given by Mrs. F. A. Dick of 537 Albion
street to her daughters, Mrs. F. A. Saw
yer. Mrs. Carrie Mehan, Mrs. Ida Tripp
and Mrs. R. L. Myrick of Alameda,
Shortly after the meal the hostess arid
fcer . guests were stricken.
The symptoms In each case were the
same, and the intensely. violent illness of
the family caused the gravest alarm. As
scon as the trouble manifested itself Dr.
Paul Lanz was summoned. The physician
discovered the cause of the illness and
administered relief as speedily as possible.
Fortunately for the stricken women the
poison had been so violent in its action
that it was not absorbed beyond the
reach of medicines. _In fact. It was duo
to the large quantity of deadly ptomaines
germinated in the food that the vicitms.
escaped death.
At it was, the experience was of a
very serious nature. The condition of
Mrs. Dick and Mrs. Myrick was such to
day that they were confined to their beds.
Mrs. Sawyer was mending. They were
reported out of danger. Mrs. Mehan and
Mrs. Tripp have recovered sufficiently to
require no further medical attention.
The dinner was given during the late
afternoon. No 111 effects were observed
dliring Its progress, although some time
elapsed between the soup and the ice
cream. It was 7 o'clock before the first
symptoms of Illness appeared. Mrs. Dick
complained of naysea and fever. Almost
simultaneously the 1 others were over
come, and It was not many minutes be
fore the five diners were in convulsive
agony. Mrs. Dick and Mrs. Myrick were
the most seriously ill, and for a time
there were grave fears expressed for
their recovery. But prompt attention and
the physiological action of the overdose
of poison saved the women.. Dr. Lanz
said to-night:
"Either the canned soup or the Icecream
caused the poisoning. It was four hours
after the meal began that the ptomaines
began to act on the patients. I cannot
say definitely in which article of food the
poison was present. Luckily for the suf
ferers there was such a' large quantity
taken" In each case that it reacted, and
to a certain extent antldoted itself. At
this time all of the patients are out of
danger, although Mts. Dick and Mrs.
Myrick are still quite "111." #
Mrs. Myrick, who resides at 1315 La
fayette street, Alameda, could not be
moved to her home. She Is the wife of
R. L. Myrick, a Southern Pacific Com
pany employe. .

Oakland Dealers Eeport a

TO BUILD NEW FACTOEY
Directors of Home for the

Begin Work on Structure
' OAKLAND, July 2.â Preparations for
thY celebration ' of the Fourth of July in
the cities on the eastern BhorÂ© of thÂ«
bay have caused. a lull in the Alameda
County /I real .estate market during tha
last "week, but as this , was expected by
the local dealers it has caused no concern,
and- confluence; is . expressed that after
people have had . time to recover from the
effect of [the "din and 'excitement of 'cele
brating Indepedence dayjn a* fitting man
ner (the ' market will resume its wonted
activity. - ; â¢ .
Much of this confidence In the future of
the Alameda County real estate â¢ market
has been .caused by the fact that while
there has been *a.~. considerable j falling off
in .the business of. the local real, estate
men in" the last week, there have .been
if anything more than the usual. number
of â¢ inquiries for Oakland and Alameda
County property from newcomers to the
coast; and - from people now residing in
the Kast. - .. /\u25a0.-,\u25a0: :..:â¢'
I The 'directors:. of the,. Home for the
Adult Blind axe considering a plan which
if carried out will mean a great improve
ment; for; the home. This is the erection
of a new broom factory building, and at
the next : meeting of the board, w*~ch
will be held on the second Tuesday of the
present month, plans for the new struc
ture will be discussed.: At the last session
of the Legislature $25,000 was appropriated
for the erection of a new factory build
ing, and as this will be available after the
Ist of January the members of the board
wish .to I secure bids for the ,work and
get the matter into Bhapa so that the
work of construction may be commenced
immediately after the Ist of the year.
S Two | prominent local real estate men re
port that they , now \u25a0 have on hand deals
which - when'- closed will mean the in
vestment of nearly JlOO.OOO or outside capi
tal in Oakland property. Several others
say that they .have fairly large deals on
hand which will be closed early In- the
present month.

The' West 'Coast Realty Company, of
which TV. P. Joost Is president and J.
C. Hill secretary, has just reorganized,
and will move Its principal offices to, tnls
city. Formerly, this company ' only con
ducted a branch : office ; in Oakland," but
owing to ia. . large increase in their local
business they: have ;found it advisable
to establish' their principal headquarters
here.
The Vandercook Company has com
piled a \ new. map of the Oakland water
front; showing the location of all the
property, fronting on the estuary, and giv
ing: the -names of the owners. This map
will be. ready for distribution In the lat

The Oakland Traction has
just appointed A: H." Herrmann, the well
known Berkeley real estate dealer, to pre
pare a booklet descriptive of , the beau

circulated in all the cars of the company.
Mr. 'Herrmann is well ; qualified : for this
work, for -he has for a long time been
one of : the most active of Berkeley's busi

THINK HE SHOT
TOW OTHER MEN
Nevada Murderer Under Sen-
tence of Deatli Believed to
Have Killed Californians
CONFESSION EXPECTED
Eiverside Authorities Are
of Opinion That Hancock
Can Clear Up Mysteries
Special Dispatch to Ths Call.
RIVERSIDE, July . 2.â Before John
Hancock goes to the^gallows at Fl
oche Nevada, and pays the penalty
of murdering two mining, prospectors,
the authorities of Riverside believe
he â¢will make . a , cnfession" and clear
up two murders which have been
mysteries here for many years. He Is
under- sentence to hang September 8. Mrs.
Hancock says he told her he killed five
other men before murdering the pros
pectors. City Marshal- Wilson Is back
from Pioche, where he went with the
hope that Hancock, would break the si
lence when the sentence of death was Im
posed. -Hancock made no confession to
him, but he Is said to have' assured jail
officials that when all hope" Is gone he
will admit "all the crimes he Is guilty of.
Hancock made his , home In Riverside
County for. years. It was here he served
his first Jail sentence. If it.be true that
he committed five other murders before
killing the prospectors in the desert, the
police say his victims must have lived in
or near Riverside County. At the tlma
Hancock became infatuated with the wo
man whose story is sending him to- the
gallows, he was Just beginning his crim
inal career.: Until she told of the mur
ders, Hancock was supposed to be merely
a petty thief.
Eleven years ago, while , Hancock was
engaged In various kinds of thefts,
Georgfe Porter.^a Wealthy San Jadnto
rancher, left, home saying he was going
to Portland, Ore., on a:â¢ pleasure . trip.
Weeks later his body was found in a field
oft : East . Indiana ; avenue, Riverside. He
had been robbed of a considerable sum of
money and shot several times. The po
lice never obtained any clew to his mur
derer. In 1596 a Frenchman's lifeless
body was found" concealed in a clump of
bushes in Santa Ana River bottom. There
was a bullet in his brain and , his hands
and feet had. been tied with rope.. The
body had been, 1 brought to the spot In . a
wagon and dragged over the ground some
distance. The identity "of the man was
never established and his murderers were
never caught. ,
The police have learned positively that
Hancock was here at the time both
crimes were committed. Because the
character of the crimes is identical with
those Hancock is known to have com
mitted and Mrs. Hancock's declaration
that he confessed five murders to her,
the ; police are. convinced they have made
no mistake in charging the crimes to
Hancock.

this State, in looking up the records of
the Wells, Fargo , Compa*ny, found it iÂ«
a Colorado 1 corporation pure and simple,
as la claimed in the papers filed in 'San
Francisco. In 1566 the Legislature, Dy a
special act, authorized the Halliday Ex
press Company to do business in thia
State. Afterward the Legislature changed
the namo to the "Wells, Fargo Express
Company. A paper on file in the Sec
retary of State's office, under date* of Oc
tober 4, 1370. certifies a decrease of capi
tal stock from. $13,000,000 to $3,000,000. If
the company should win the case, it
means no State excepting Colorado, in
which the. Incorporation took place, can'
impose any taxes. , - , . v

COMES BACK TO PORT
New Vessel Springs
â¢ a Leak on,. First

Pumps on Boat Built
for Nome Trade
TTcplpcc
Â« vj ov.iv.oo. .. .
' The new steam schooner Anvil returned
â¢to port yesterday leaking. She started
to Nome on Saturday, and had barely
Â£0X outside the Heads when she began to
>ak. Captain Maion ordered the pumps
' nut to work. His crew responded and
fought vainly to get the pumps to work,
â¢ but without success. They were found
to be utterly useless. As the water kept N
slowly gaining. Captain Mason decided to
Vut back to port. He thinks that the
fault docs not lie in the pumps them
selves, but In the loading of the cargo,
v.hich may press too tightly on the pump
sha/ts. The Anvil was built at the Fulton
Iron Works. She Is of 296 tons burden,
and is owned by J. J. Sesnon & Co.
She is fitted with two 150 horsepower
gas engines and twin screws. She was
built expressly for the northern trade.
t-Â« ply between St. Michael. Nome and
other ports in that region.
On her trip from here she was carry
ing a cargo of crude oil and general sup
plies. Captain Mason said that the whole
cargo would have to be taken out in order
to ascertain the cause of defect in the
action of the pumps.
The boat experienced strong northwest
\u25a0winds as soon as she left the Golden Gate
yesterday, which kept up until she turned
her nose back to the harbor.
Tries to End Life.
A young girl named Jeesle Johnson, who lives
at the Hoffman House on Pacific street, tried
'.o Â«al her life early yestsrday morning by tak
ing & Â£osÂ« of nitrate of silver. The landlord
discovered her In the agonies cf death and
fhouted for help. Officer P. J. McMann was
quickly on the oeÂ«ie an.l carried the girl to
â¢he Harbor Emergency Hospital. Here Dr. F.
Tillsien applied a stomach pump, and after two
hours' hard work Ehe was restored to con
sciousness. About 10 o'clock a young man ap
peared upon the scene, bringing the girl's hat
and coat. He stated he was her friend. Th*
girl got out of the bed the nurses had provided
â¢or her. and with difficulty dressed herself
and went away with her friend.

THE SAN-PRANGISCO^GALI-,Â§MONDA^^
HEROINE WEARS
WIGS GALORE
"The Belle of Eichmond^
Offers 3lore Possibilities in
- Hair Than in Situations
CLEVEE FOLK; BAD PLAY
Toier's Prod uction Is Poor
in the Elements That
Cony ince Gro>Mi-Up People
One new thing there is in "The Belle
of Richmond"â a heroine who wears wigs.
Her first act is in auburn, of the kind
called- "carrots" the. small, boy
sports it. A soulful blonde she bccoinos
in the next act. What Miss -Mendum
wears In the third I do not know. Even a
burning curiosity as to whether she. be
comes an albino or an African could ; not
hold me for any more of "The Belle of
Richmond." The play purports to be by
one Sydney . S..Tblâ¬r. ' It is a play of the
South. Poor old South! Poor old col
onels! Poor v old whisky! Poor old
"hawses!" Poor old "niggah," with the
everlasting lumbago, 'vl-,'v 1 -,'
v lf "Mr. Toler" were sixteen, and wore
his hair, in pigtails tied with pale blue
ribbon, one could forgive "The Belle of
Richmond." She . might be quite a nice
girl who could make the chief situation
that of one colonel calling another: "No
gentleman, suh," for permitting â¢ his j son
to be arresUd in the personâ thatâ isâ
notâ a gentleman's house. In grown-up
drama it does not convince. Nor out of
the schoolroom, is it considered proper for
| a gentleman to propose with half an apple
pie ( in his mouth, nor for â¢ the lady to
halloo "yes" through the other half. Not
a lady "as is a Jady," that Is. Exception
al, too, is the privilege oj the old "nig
gah," who laughs in his mistress' face at
her wiles to secure a husband. Nor,.sis
ter, does. Boston make the kind of girl
\u25a0*you make of Winifred Masonâ nor, inci
dentally that Miss Mendum makes. .In
short "The Belle of Richmond" is of the
weirdly naive order of plays. A solemn
little audience sat solemnly through-, it
yesterday afternoon at the Grand Opera
house and the ushers did the rest. >
Miss Georgie Drew Mendum is head
lined In the cast, but it is Lillian Albert
son who plays* the. role, of the "belle of
Richmond." It Is a pity that. this clever
young woman, who some'three years ago
made her debut- at the same theater,
should reappear here in this unfortunate
medium. Miss 'Albertson brings sincerity,
simplicity and much charm of- person to
the role. Miss Mendum makes matters
worse with .the ; Boston girl, that she
plays in the loud, elbowy,- strident fash
lon of her typewriter, missâ there,* 'very
properlyâ in . "The Usurper." His name
is Norval, Norval McGregor, who plays
the hero. '\u25a0 George Parsons," the other
headliner, with Miss Mendum occasion
ally looks real, and Arthur Royce wears
the villain's silk hat and' smokes the vil
lain's cigarette most villainously, . that
is, with some conviction. The old ser
vant Js well done by -John Ravold.'
BLANCHE PARTINGTON.
With some excellent new specialties and
several of the star " acts that' lent ~ luster
to last week!s bill, the show at the Or
pheum this week is one of the top
notchers. Of the' new : people Frederick
Voelker, violin virtuoso, is probably In the
lead .from an artistic standpoint He is a
master of .. the violin' and * his /wizardry
with the bow was appreciated'^ by the
entire audience, even the gallery lending
its meed of encouragement, though it is
a hard thing for a violinist to make an
impression; on the : upper tiers at fhe
Orpheum. The Zazell . and . Vernon com
pany of pantomimists made a hit, and
Schepp's dogs and- ponies : highly pleased
those who have not: tired of the feats of
trained quadrupeds. Henriette de Serris'
bronze and marble statuary, presented oy
"fifteen distinguished Parisian 'models,"
was of the most beautiful of that class of
work and though last on the programme
was' seen by nearly the entire audience,
few leaving before the list of groups had
been completed. The eight Bedouin Arabs,
the Wilson trio and Claude Gillingwater
& Co. urougrht out the storms of applause
that^greeted them last week, and George

DENTAL BOARD'S
SESSION STORMY
v According to the statements of Dr., John
XI. Dunn, who has just returned from the
meeting of, the State Dental Board'in Los
Angeles, the sessions of that' body r were
unsually stormy. On nearly every propo
sition he and Dr. Cool, who preferred the
charges alleging, that Dr. Mayhew of Palo
Alto gave out the questions before the
date of examination, were outvoted jj by,
the other five members of the board, who
apparently, were united. Dr.' Dunn said:
It'seemed to me that they purposely delayed
tho meeting as long as possible, \ so , thaft they
could enjoy i the lengthened vacation * at -i the"
expense of the State. We could 'have finished
the business In half of the time we took. .There
were three j communications sent to the board
which j were never ' acted ; upon. . One : was the
petition i of â¢* the ; students . wno -. took . the - exam
inations \u25a0 to' have = the successful Â»- list of .candi
dates published; another was Dr. Cool's request
that the examination papers be filed with th 4
secretary until , after ' the \u25a0. Investigation -by ihe
Governor's commission: In August, and -;the
other : was '. the report* of Attorney E. , Myron
-Wolf.: The \u25a0', five :\u25a0. carried everything and ; Dr.'
Cool and I had no chance. We protested loudly
against , the dismissal -of Attorney Wolf, but
they proceeded to shelve him without alleging
any reason. -,'\u25a0\u25a0 ; â¢ '- â¢â, \u25a0.
i-. Attorney ,Wolf -was a very surprised
man when Dr. Dunn informed him last

fact"that- I received a. letter 'from 'the

DE.EADER INDIGNANT
Spe<aks for the Eights "and
Liberty of Citizens in
City of , Sari Francisco
TheJ Rev. \ William Rader, delivered a
patriotic sermon last, night at the "Third
Congregational^ Church. â¢ The large con
gregation , sang; the" 1 national anthem at
the close of the address. . ; \u25a0
I Dr. .Rader. devoted much . of his sermon
to .'the .civic } condition >of San "> Francisco,
laying stress upon everyone of the great
words in the Declaration of Independence.
He ; flayed Vbossism".' arid said , that -the
people ' are covereign" and' in their \u25a0. hands
rests the power of government. '.'There
should be no master,' no boss, no king, no
"autocracy,", he said, Vbut that independ
enceâthat rule Vby -; all the peopleâ for
which . the Declaration of Independence
stands."> -^SSSSSiSiSSSSs^^^l^^^^S^
..Among other things Dr.Rader said:
The' 'Declaration -of -. Independence" means
equality. of rights, th<? right to live and to
make a ' living. < and that the people . are the
government and public officers public servants.
These truths have swept over the earth, leav
ing republics In/ their path. "Witness how. they
have changed the political 'face of Europe â
of Italy and France, of Switzerland, of South
America, . Cuba .' and : Russia, ' where ' the ad
vance of the people threatens the dethronement
of the I Czar. ucs***ss*i*wÂ»Â«.Â»*. â
The -spirit* of -independence is not dead' in
old Philadelphia, where Mayor Weaver â¢ rang
the ' bell of municipal freedom in' a : conflict
with the \u25a0 bosses and overthrew the usurpers.
â¢ -San Francisco needs to listen to these bell
strokes.
What a scene we have looked upon this last
week! 'Our streets have been filled <wlth mobs,
and Sheriffs have - taken the place of the po
lice." Innocent citizens have been clubbed and
mobbed when they bought and read a boy
cotted-paper.-I do not argue the question at
issue between the belligerents; that has noth
ing; to do with. the plain violation of law and
order; it has nothing to do with the riotous
opposition . to the rights of citixenfl and the
liberty of speech. \u25a0 . ' ~ - r~:
: Is the- spirit- of our fathers dead here In
California? ~. la the \u25a0>\u25a0 bludgeon the i scepter of
power?" la the hoodlum to rule the atreete?
What a farce â¢to deliver Fourth of July ora-_
tions and burn powder when the lives of peace
ful men and women are endangered. . .
Are we returning to the days of tyranny and
klnscraft? â¢ . . :': '
,Where is the Declaration of . Independence,
the right to live, . to - buy - and sell, the right
to be let alone, the right to be defended against
mobs and- murder? Who shall be the next
victim? ." â¢ ,- "'..,\u25a0' ;>>.-: -..\u25a0â¢'.. -p ', \u25a0â¢"-\u25a0'
The people, are against ench - things. The
civic conscience \u25a0 rebela against such condi
tions. - The people are against the newsboys
who . Incite riot and against those men who
Incite the newsboy*.
The government of the State of California
and of the United States Is against them, and
the government of , this city, through its May

'"The Basis of. the Nation's Greatness"

tant"'Eesiilts in California
Paul D. Kelleter of the United States
Forest Service, Department of Agricul
ture, is a guest -at the Occidental Hotel
awaiting the arrival from Washington of
six . men \u25a0 from ! the \u25a0' department who are
to visit the northenr"f>art of California
under his : direction for ' the purpose of
studying: the marketable qualities of the
white -fir." Mr. Kelleter has been doing
active .work in California on behalf of the
Government arid ; in "conjunction with the
State authorities in the northern coun
ties for . several years, . during which he
has made ; maps \u25a0of . the .. forests of the
State and forwarded data to Washington
that will soon reappear in pamphlet form.
Two ' years ago . the ', co-operative \u25a0\u25a0 ar
rangement between . California and - the
Government went into effe-Jt whereby both
.were . to share ' the ] expense of aboricul
ture. Mr. , Kelleter was -selected to take
charge of. the work, having 'made a thor
ough study of forestry. at Yale for sev
eral years and gaining practical experi
ence in other States. The two years'
contract ended last month and has again
been renewed. At the same; time the
Government has changed the name of tne
Bureau of Forestry to simply Forest Ser
vice. - "
1 Mr. Kelleter has just returned from
Mariposa County and the Yosemlte,
where he has been doing work for the
Government.- As soon as his men arrive
from Washington . the party will leave
for-McCloud, where they will try to
learn whether it is possible to use the
white flr as wood pulp. It is of poor
quality for . lumber, and if it can be
made of commercial value the great for
ests of white fir will rapidly increase in
value.. . -,:"*'â
When the work is finished the results
will be sent to Washington and there-re
issued-in pamphlet form. Beside work in
the mountain counties, Mr. Kelleter has
made a " semi-official visit to Humboldt
and other lumber regions and a general
study of the . lumber industry. He has
also compiled a forest map of the State,
which is issued -at Washington; and
which shows the distribution of the va
rious species and their standing.
FLAMES CAUSE
A MAN'S DEATH
Epeclal Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, July 2.â ln a fire that was
started : by. the explosion of an oil stove
to-day one man was burned to death, two
others injured and two cottages complete
ly ' destroyed. The explosion occurred in
the cottage* at 665 North Whitney street,
while John Miller, an aged scavenger,
was cooking his breakfast. The burning
oil*; spread . all '\u25a0.-. over Miller's clothes and
almost instantly he was a mass of flames.
"With ,a . shriek he : staggered into the
street : and \ cried out for aid. He was
burned almost beyond recognition, though
aid was given him by Pietro Mascagni.
In helping Miller Mascagni was badly
burned about the- face and. hands. . His
injuries are not serious.
\u25a0 The right hand of George L. Tonkins, a"
fireman, was badly crushed and mangled
while he was reeling hose. s
Miller was at once removed to the Red
Cross Sanitarium, where he died this aft
ernoon. â¢
Miller was a native of Germany, and
about 65 years of age. He lived all alone.
He made a will shortly before he died,
leaving about $5000 worth . of property to
Mrs. Irene * Frost, -matron of the Red
Cross Sanitarium. Miller's cottage and
that of V. D. Cortese adjoining were de
stroyed. The loss will amount to $10,000.

MIDSUMMER BUSINESS CONDITIONS.
THE midsummer holiday season is now "here, and tine usual lull
in trade is to be expected. Thus far, however, no real dullness
is visible. All parts of the country report trade active and con
ditions sound and assuring. The distributive trade is reported good
everywhere, and manufactures and general industries show less
than the average quieting down common at this season, while such
fall business as has already appeared indicates large trading in this
direction later on? Unusually cold and wet weather in some parts of
the wheat and corn belts has somewhat reduced previous estimates
of the output of These cereals, but unless something still more serious
occurs there will be abundant harvests of both. ,
The bank clearings made their usual excellent exhibit last week,
those for the whole country showing, a gain of 34.8 per cent over
the corresponding week last year, with all fir^t-class cities except
Cincinnati reporting increases more or less large, such as 46.3 per
cent at New York, 17.2 at Chicago, 38.9 at Philadelphia, 32.5 at Pitts
burg, 36.3 at New Orleans, and so on. â¢ The showing of San Fran
cisco in this direction thus far this year is brilliant. Our clearings
in June were $148,980,164, against $125,050,587 in June, 1904- For
the first six months "in 1905 they were $855,905,003, against $727,4 19,
*347 for the first half of 1904. This is an increase of $128,485,656^0^
the first half of 1905, and is a fine exhibit of the increase of trade in
San Francisco this year.
The failures throughout the United States last week were 186,
against 204 during the corresponding week in 1904. The railway
earnings for June as far as reported show an increase over last year
of 7.9 per cent.
Money continues plentiful and easy everywhere. There was a
sharp rise'in call loans in New York to 6 per cent on Friday owing
to its being the last day of the month and of the fiscal year, but this
almost always loccurs at such times, and occasioned no particular
.concern. J. P. Morgan & Co. loaned about $3,000,000 during the
day, and the rate immediately fell back to 3 per cent, where it
closed. The internal troubles of Russia, the Moroccan incident and
the general unrest in European politics, with menaces of possible
â¢ 'war in several quarters, and the demands upon the banks for funds
wherewith to liquidate the semi-annual interest and dividend ac
counts contributed toward hardening the money market," and the
noteworthy feature of the rise in rates was that it should have been
so^ small and transitory. It did not last more than an hour or two,
and its brief duration fully confirms previous assertions that any
call upon the money market of the country could be promptly met
on demand without strain or friction. The July, disbursements in
interest and dividends are estimated at $140,311,000, or about
$5,500,000 in excess of 1904.
The staples show no noteworthy change in general conditions.
Cotton" has been excited and strong during the. past week, with ac
*tive speculation at New York and New Orleans, with a rapid ad
vance in prices and confident predictions of still higher quotations
by Price and other leaders in this market. Wool and woolen goods
continue firm at high prices for the raw material, with the clip pass
ing rapidly out of raisers' hands. * Hides and leather remain about
as before, some descriptions being easy and others firm, tKe aggre
gate situation being strong. The steel trade, while somewhat dull
Â«n light finished steel, is particularly good in rails, structural mate
rial and other heavy products. The pigiron market is reported in
satisfactory condition, with* signs of a general revival. Provisions
rule steady to firm, though speculation at Chicago is not very brisk.
The returns of commerce for the first eleven months of the fis
cal year were excellent. The exports of breadstuff s fell off about
$44,000,000 from the same period in 1904, but the total exports of
the country exceeded those of 1904 by $30,000,000, establishing
a new record, while imports for the same period amounted to
$1,128,000,000, passing the billion-dollar point for the first time. The
gold movement is making an equally; good showing. In May, 1904,
we exported gold to the net amount of nearly $33,000,000, and in
May, 1903, to'the amount of $13,000,000, but in May of. this year we
turned the tables in our favor with net imports of $2,175,000.
All these conditions show the continued excellence. and stability
"of general business. Some lines may lag for a few weeks, but in
creased activity in others always counterbalances the diminished ani
mation of the former. Taking the country as a whole, therefore,
and considering the indifference exhibited in 'the speculative mar
kets, it will be seen that in the aggregate the country has never been
on a more stable and prosperous basis than it is to-day.
TUNNELING IN CITIES.
THE craze for rapid transit in American cities has caused the
burrowing of streets in New York and Chicago to an extent
that now threatens to cause great catastrophes, t In New York
the sinking of the surface has been observed since the subway arid
'other tunnels were made, and in Chicago, where a floating
tion is more general than in New York, the disturbance is more
threatening. It is predicted by engineers in Chicago that the sky
scrapers will'be toppling over if the disturbance of foundation con
tinues.
It has been suggested that we adopt the subway in San Fran
/â¢ cisco. Before this is decided it should be in order to consider the
floating foundation that exists practically from Montgomery street
to trie- bay. It is a perfectly safe foundation if itsj equilibrium^ is not
disturbed. With equality of weight and pressure conditions un
all parts it is as good as rock. But any great change in its equality
' of condition will no doubt imperil all heavy buildings that rest
upon it . \u25a0[
It may be said truthfully that the necessity for sinking -under-.
; ground transit does not exist here. It will be a long time before
any street in San Francisco is as crowded as Piccadilly.: Instead
of striving to retain all traffic on one thoroughfare, congesting it
for the sake of massing business along its channel,' it is the; proper
policy of every commercial city to encourage the spread of traffic
to otner streets, as it has already spread hereto Mission, Howard and
Folsom streets, without in. the least impairing the supremacy of
â¢ Market as our main commercial-artery.
Man was not made to burrow in the ground like a gopher or
a billy-owl, and the prospect above ground is too fair in California
to make burrowing necessary. or endurable.

Why Many Women Fail
in the Business World
IT HAS been repeatedly stated that
- although women's work Vis .quite
equal to that of men, the "scale of
payment is much lower, owing to . the
prejudice which still exists in the minds
of men agalnstvthe encroachment of
women In the ; labor market .and; to the
competition among women themselves on
account of the ever-increasing; number^
who are 'forced' to^ "earn their own liveli
hood;, says Beatrice â¢M. Studdy in the
Pittsburg Dispatch.
As a matter of fact, however, except/
in rare cases, women's work . is not equal
to that of , men, not because' they. arenot
equally capable .of .doing it; or dor.not
understand it, i but ., because V : very few
women can be induced to take their work
seripusly, and | will hot devote the 'time
necessary 1 to perfecting themselves In it
until too late. If they enter' the: ranks
of workers -as girls, -they do so in >; nine
cases out of ten simply, to earn. sufficient
money to dress on until such time'as'they

":\^â^- headed manicure girl in the bar

pompadour out of her eyes, and went : on :
"Really, ;. now. :. I ought not. to give - them
away, \u25a0 for j they're awfully good -to me,"
and here she fairly bristled wlth'the sense
of -past attentions. Not ejen' a matinee
idol could help letting some of it out; and
with apparent â¢ reluctance she coyly ad
mitted, o "But â yes, they,< do." i ;
The 'murder was out and the little
manicure appeared so relieved that she
burst^. into ;a contagious laugh. : Love
making didn't, .weigh seriously on her
mind. It was all a good Joke and as
necessary. a part of \u25a0> the business of life
as doing her. hair .with 'the Marcel wave.
"Well, I'll tell you Just how it is." She
was simply bursting^to tell all about It,"
and with a naive display of confidence
she Jumped Into the middle of her tale.
It was - like the scent of battle to ' the
war horse.
"You ,know most, men think they are
privileged to make love ; to^, a manicure,
just as theydo to their typewriter, but
It; doesn't really -. amount to anything,
really It doesn'tâ at least not to nie.
IT'S REALLY FUJTNY.
"I simply take it all as a good Joke and
refuse to look at' lt seriously; and this, as
you may, imagine, ( is pretty : disconcerting
to a conceited man and acts like ; a wet
blanket. .It's fun to see them" writhe un
der'lt when they are maKlngJ such des
perate ; efforts to make an impression,"
and the girl ; laughed gayly. much as (a

"But there â¢ are* so many different types
of men,"; continued this font of wisdom
to . a" New .York Sun. man. ."you can't al
ways I tell," Just*: what attitude they will
take. At least, at first I couldn't always
Judge correctly, but now"â and' the wise
young, creature looked volumesâ "you
can't fool" me' a bit.
"I can whether, a man Is going to
make love . to me the moment he enters
the 'shop. That's right," she added, al
though no. one had presumed to question
such competent authority.
"I have what I suppose you would call
a psychic knowledge of what he is going
to say before he opens his mouth. He'll
try open flattery,' '; squeeze your hand and
look ;. unutterable things, and say them,
too, or else he will . try a more : subtle
method; : if he be . one of the slick ones.
He will compliment you by inference, and
somehow you always like that.
'.'There is one type, generally past fifty,
that â¢Is insufferable. "He thinks, . and this
is the funniest. part of it, ; that because he
happens to ; admire , you you must fall
immediately into his arms. . The idea!
"Never, by any.i possible chance; does it
occur i to : him that you have any ; prefer

Tutor From America
for Ruler of Spain
RALPH L. RAY. who will teach
.King Alfonsoof Spain American
customs, -was born on a Wls
sln farm in 1887, where .he lived
until 1893, when he moved with his
parents" to Lancaster. In the fall of
18D3 he started to attend school in
graded school and graduated from the
Lancaster High School. inM9O4. in the
modern i classical ; course, being excep
tionally, attracted *to : the languages.
Outside of his regular school' work he
studied French and Spanish and mas
tered typewriting and stenography. In
August, 1904, he took, a position as
bookkeeper with the Livestock Commis
sion Company at the Union Stockyards,
Chicago, and to perfect himself In Span
ish-he took a course under a Spanish
tutor." ' His reason for perfecting him
self in the language was his wish to go
to Cuba;
About two months ago a Spanish
Count visited with the Spanish Consul
at Chicago and desired ; some one to
â¢show; him through the" stockyards who
could answer, his inquiries concerning
the workings at the yards in Spanish.
Young: Ray,"- hearing of this, introduced
himself to the Count and "â¢ offered . his
services, which; were accepted, the two
spending, one' day on the tour. Ray's
knowledge of the Spanish language, as
well as his acquaintance with the busi
ness methods and ; work at : the stock
.yards, made an Impression on the Count.
'At the close of the day young Ray. was
invited to attend a dinner given by.the
Spanish Consul in honor of the Count.
At. this - banquet the Count - told Ray
that.whenhereturned to Spain if there
was any opening In the way of tutoring
presented he would use his^nfluence to
obtain a" place for him. *
.Ray, thinking the Count waa compli
menting .him rather than ;ln earnest,
told, him he would be glad of the.op
portunity.'and was much surprised some
time later upon the 'receipt \u0084of,a "letter
from the Count's secretary saying that
the young Spanish King Alfonso wished
to' learn American* ways and customs
and desired to get a ."\u25a0 knowledge ,â¢ of
American ideas from oomo young Amer

Take Much Needed Eespite
From Multifarious' Duties
OTHEES MUST REMAIN
On Eetiirn of Ministers Plans
Are to Be Completed
for Eemarkable Eevivai
The vacation season for tired and over
worked clergymen has arrived, and dur
ing the next two weeks a large : number
will leave the city \u25a0 for rest and needed
refreshment. A number will* visit the
Lewis and Clark Exposition, but most of
them will be found at- the sea shore or
else among the high Sierras. A good
many will select their camps where the
nshing is good, for successful parsons are
invariably good fishermen.
No clergyman in the United States are
worked so hard as those in, San Fran
cisco. Few churches have or can afford
assistants, and the demand upon the tlmÂ«
and strength of the average city, clergy
man Is incessant. The congregations, are
generous in admitting the need of change
for these- ministers and cheerfully grant
a leave of absence.
There are a good many self-sacrificing
men, however, who cannot afford, neither
themselves nor their congregations, a va
cation.
GREAT REVIVAL PLANNED. V
On the return of the clergymen to the
city plans will mature for the greatest
religious revival that has ever been at
tempted in California. All denominations
will combine to make the demonstration a
memorable one.
Rev. A. C. Bane, D.D., of the How
ard-street M. E. Church proposes |to rest
during the next few weeks at the family
ranch in the San Joaquin Valley, taking
occasional jaunts among the neighboring
mountains and preaching in some of the
minor camps, as opportunity is afforded.
Rev. G. W. Hough of the California
street M. E. Church will first attend the
Lewis and Clark Fair and afterward pro
ceed to the Yellowstone Park for a week
or more, and then, if possible," extend his
visit as far East as Evanston. 111., where
he will attend the Garrett Theological
Seminary, which holds a summer session.
The Rev. Mr. Hough expects to resume
his labors about the last of August.
The Rev. Frederick M. Clampett, D. D.,
of Trinity Church will this year spend the
summer at Carmel-by-the-Sea with his
numerous family. No clergyman works
harder then Dr. Clampett and a good re
spite from parochial cares will be wel
comed by. that indefatigable priest.
WHERE THEY WILL GO.
The Rev. \u25a0 Cecil Marrack, curate of St.
Luke's Church, has been granted a
month's leave, which he will spend on a
walking tour in the Sierras, doing mission,
ary work as opportunity presents. Upon
the return of his curate Rev. Burr M.
Weeden, rector of St. Luke's, will visit a
well known watering* place for needed
rest. /-"\u25a0 â¢
Bishop Hamilton on his return from
Los Angeles will proceed to Klamathon
for a stay of several weeks. The Bishop
is a famous angler and expects to hook
many a trout in the well, slacked waters
of Klamath streams.
The Rev. F. M. Larkin. Ph. D., of
Grace Methodist Episcopal Church will
take a long rest, tramping over Lake
County hills and nshing in . the - beautiful
lakes and streams of that famous lo
cality.- .
The Rev. Charles Jenness, the popular
minister of Trinity Methodist Church.
Berkeley, will attend the general con
vention of the Epworth League in" Den
ver. His vacation will be a short one. :. ;
The Rev. T. R. Earl, pastor of Park
Congregational Church, Hayes and Lyon
streets, has had no vacation for three
years and will have none this season.
The Rev. William Kirk Guthrie of the
First Presbyterian will spend part of July
and all of August in a short visit to the
Lewis and Clark fair at Portland and
later in a trip* to some secluded spot,
where good fishing abounds, in the high
Sierras. At present Mr. Guthrie" is en-
Joying the hospitalities of San Anselmo.
The Rev. George W. White, D. D., of
Central Methodist Episcopal Church has
planned. a visit to Los Angeles, and but
for the illness of Mrs. White would now,
be in that city. If the lady recovers suf
ficiently to be able to travel only a short

WORK TO BE RESUMED
ON SAN ANTONIO.
Landmarks League Determined ;Restoratiori
of Oia Mission SMll Be Finished.
WILL AfFEALiTO PUBLIC FOR FUNDS
LAURA BRIDE POWERS.
Last Monday, the board' of directors
of the [ California ; Landmarks League
met in the; grand ; secretary's Comce; of
the Native- Sons' . building tbj consider
the completion of ~ restoring "â¢' Mission
S&n Antonio.- de ; ; Pauduaj^* Monterey
County, v indisputably; the -most pic
turesque ruin In Northern' Calif ornla. i
During the winter "an unprecedented
fail of rainâ ~-2t Inchesâ -caused the
league grave \ concern . over the fate of
the work done upon the : old walls dur
ing the previous summer." But .the re
cent visit to the old sanctuary by Con
gressman' Joseph ;R.; Knowland, presi
dent of.- the league, proved that the
intelligent safeguarding: of the "newly
laid bits of wall -.by Superintendent
Forbes had reduced the damage to a
minimum. The _ most â serious damage
was the caving "in. of .'.ithes, beautiful
vaulted arch in the : vestibule, prevent
ing the annual celebration of San"An
tonio day at the missionsâthe first time
since the raising of the cross under the
oaks in 1771. This ceremony for many
years -was; held in^ the vestibule â -ever
since the tiled roof of the church fell
in, covering the graves of .the' founders
who lie at rest in the chancel. , ;'
No San Antonio day.; And the news
brought grief to many devotees -who
since childhood have gathered here un-.
der the olive trees for worship and the
merrymaking that followed. > .
â¢ Mr. Knowland . reported to the board
that $150 would | probably coyer : the
damage to i the walls; that^the' lumber
purchased the previous* summer from
Sans Brothers' millâ a cuaint old mill
far up in the Santa Lucia mountains
was lying in the field in front of the
mission, ready for use; that the great
trusses had nearly all been: put In
place, the lumber on hand , being suf
ficient, with the exception at more
shakes, to complete the - restoration.
The only obstacle remaining was a
scarcity of funds.
To be sure, the small matter, of funds
has interfered with plans beforeMn the
world's history, but the board of direc
tors unanimously agreed that Califor-
nia would not let it Interfere with this
plan. Therefore it was resoU'ed to
make a personal appeal to All "Who
Care that they join the league at 51
per year, become, life members at :$25,
or contribute to the work 'whatever
their patriotism and finances suggest.
And. fellow Californians, if we would
save this treasure of , the pastâvalu
able as a commercial asset, more valu
able from a social, moral, historic and
an inspirational viewpointâ we must do
it now. ..'\u25a0-\u25a0' \u25a0'"\u25a0 j . :
There sometimes lurks in i " the hearts
of- men a suspicion that people who in
terest themselves in public affairâ affairs
that lie beyond their doorstepsâ do Jso
from motives other than devotion -to
ideals. Now, for the benefit- of such, 1
beg to state that r since the work of the
Landmarks League began, ; three years
ago, no moneys were paid out for salaries
or other needless expenditures â even the
architects, Newton^ J. Tharp. who drew
the design for the "Fort Gunnybags".Uab
let. and "William T>. Shea, now, City Archi
tect, who furnished plans j for, the restora
tion of San Antonio, \u25a0â¢* performing .-\u25a0< their,
services gratuitously. . Arid as to the ad
ministration of- the work upon the Mis
sion, the strictest, economy marked every
detail, the league obtaining* the lumber
needed at ?2 per M lower than the mar
ket rate, and the ; laborer's services, at $1
per day and foundâ the secretary fitting
out a provision | camp in the mission or
chard, where twelve laborers were taken
care of, comfortably but economically, for
six weeks, during, which - time \u25a0 splendid
work was done. " . \u25a0 ...
Then came the calamityâ the funds ran
low, . and President Knowland : called &
halt, according to the league's by-laws.
And > now It is necessary to start in
againâ unless the 51300 that has ; already
been spent \u25a0 shall have been thrown to
the winds, and we Californians stsnri con
victed before the world as apathetic, nig
gardly, unpatriotic, and -ignorant of the
values of these historic places that 'in
Europeâ or ; even nearer homeâ would be
taken care of as a natural public duty. 1
: \u25a0'. â¢ Therefore the | Landmarks | League will
make direct appeal to - the patriotic and
Intelligent Californians i for I i assistance,
equipping Its representative, Mrs. Beulah
Gronlund, with proper credentials ;Of
identification and; authorizing I her to so
licit contributions to that $1500 fund that
is needed to complete , the restoration of
the Mission. Mrs. Gronlund will present
a certificate of membership to all \u25a0 who
help, and the lists will : be -published In
The Call from time to time.
It has also been decided to prepare a
"roll of honor"â a tablet | upon -which
shall be \u25a0 engrossed ~- the names *\u25a0 of every
member of the league, 'and such : patriotic
Californians as contribute' to the .restora
tionâthe same to be placed in the A'cstl
bule when the ancient sanctuary shall
have been ; saved. f. : v V , V
Should the representative ', of ; the league
call upon you, you are urged [to consider

NAPA. July 2.â William Burns, en
gineer on the California Northwestern
passenger train which runs between
Napa and Tiburon, was seriously and
probably fatally Injured this morning
by being struck by & locomotive as he
was getting off his own engine with a
bundle of clothing in his arms and pre
paring to get on a heavier engine. An
other passenger train came along: and
the engine of the latter train struck
him. The locomotive knocked . him
about twenty feet, terribly Injuring him
on the head and side.
Burns was removed to the Southern
Pacific Hospital in San Francisco. It la
thought that he Is Injured Internally.
The bundle of clothing probably saved

ing- men a financial information
bureau. All the / banks. bankers,
brokers, fiscal , agents, financial syndi
cates, industrial. Investment and min

ported upon by Dun and Bradstreet.
The bureau will be known as the Con
solidated Mercantile Agency.. It will
report to prospective investors here and
in the East on the standing of the great
concerns that desire to sell stocks and
securities. _. . .
To bring more Eastern money to Cali
fornia < f 6r the development of enter
prises the agencywill be advantageous.
Unscrupulous promoters have succeeded
in many localities in' bringing Western
investments into disrepute. The local

\u25a0 Tou never can tell wnat team is po
lng to get avray with a ball game till
the last man has been declared out.
The Seals had theirs already In yester
day afternoon and were whiling away
a few idle moments and figuring on
next week when the Angels suddenly
traded in and tied up the score in the
ninth. The Seals' dream had not been
finished In the tenth when the Ftars of
Los Angeles ushered another delegation
of two through. Then it was good
night.
Every one agreed that UnclÂ« was the
h^rd luck kid for the day. All the fans
\u25a0were rooting for him and prayir.gr that
the Giants might beat the Tiger? in the
north. But prayers and yells do not
get any rune on the diamond, ko San
Francisco was given quite a setback
when the Angels humbled them Iwice.
Big Wright started off the afternoon
game in as wild a manner a; any
pitcher who ever toed the rubber. He
could not get the ball over the plate
end when he did accidentally throw a
good one the Seals were wont to wallop
It.' They started the bJg rally in round
two. when \Vilson was passed. "Goch
riauer singled to right and Williams
gave Uncle two for a starter with a
two-cushion phot into left field.
In the meantime the Angels could not
get a man on the sacks and everything
lool;ed lovely for the Seals. Just to
sort of cinch the game they registered
another in the eighth, when Joe Nealon
punched one to left that Artie Ross
t-ould not quite reach and it went for
two stations. Wilson walked and
Nealon stole third. Gochnauer was
piven the office to bunt and Nealon
started home. But Goch missed the
ball and Spies had Nealon frozen at
tlie pliite. He made the dummy play
of winging the ball to second, letting
ihe run score.
After all that disaster it looked awful
czsy for San Francisco. But the Angels
got to Williams in the eighth for a
t*n:ple. Wright made the first hit by
belting a bunt to third, i He stole and
romped in when' Bernard singled.
Borney came through on Flood's safe
wallop, making the score 4 to I.
The Angels were there with the big
front in the ninth. Dillon was passed
itnd Brashear got a slap in the ribs.
Ross bunted, putting both up. and Wil
liams forgot himself long enough to
make a wild pitch, letting Dillon arrive.
Sp.ies bunted along the first base line
and Brashear tore to the pan with the
one that tied it up.
The Seals could not make good in
their half of the ninth, but the Angels
etni'had fight left in them when they
came up in the tenth. With Wright
down. Bernard lifted a fly to center
which Waldron dropped. Flood bingled
and so did Smith, chasing both men
home and winning the game, for the
Seals went out in a row. The score:

"faarry Bpencer was not In condition
to play the gamÂ« In the mornlnjr at
Oakland, so Cap "Wilson was forced
to trade Into right field and do the best
he could, which was very bad. In the
fifth he dropped a fly with two out.
Five runs followed with the aid of one
little hit. This let the Angels win as
they pleased. Henley was a bit wild,
â¢walking four, hitting one and execut
ing a wild pitch. Gray allowed only
four hits, so the Seals were lucky in
making a run. The score:

Special Dispatch to The Call.
i RENO, July 2.â Even money and take your pick is the watering on the out
come of the Root-Hart fight, which will be decided, to-morrow afternoon. The
adherents of â¢ each have strong arguments to advance to show why their man
should win. Hart has adeclded pull in the weights, as. he scales about â¢ 190
pounds to Root's 170. This Increased, weight means strength and vitality, * two
qualities which Bhould , play; an important part In the decision or the battle.;
To offset this Root is conceded to be . a more finished boxer, with ability to
make every, blow count. "Whether there will be sufficient force behind them to
bring Hart down' the fight alone will demonstrate. The men will represent two
distinct | types of athletes j! when they strip for the fray. ; Root's muscles stand
out sharply defined from his frame, where their play may be seen as he moves
about. Hart is built on round alines, like- Young.: Corbett. and his muscles of
steel make no ruffle on the surface of hisbody. ' * '
BIG ; KBNTUCKIAIV IS EXPECTED TO FORCE THE FIGHT.
It Is expected j Hart will rush , the fight from the start in an effort to keep
Root from getting set, thus impairing the efficiency of his blows. It Is conceded
: hls_chances'of victory are slim if he stands off and boxes, as he Is far from
being a master of the art. V . \
Both ; fighters and! spectators will suffer from the heat. The arena Is In
closed by a high 'fence, which wlll'shut out the cooling breeze which usually
prevails here. : The seats and other woodwork Â«; will, attract the sun and add to
tho discomfort. of the occasion. If! the fight goes any, distance, and It seems the
consensus of opinion that it will Burely.last fifteen rounds; the fighters will get
a scorching- about the , arms and shoulders. Their, troubles will be aggravated
'by the : application ot water; during, each minute interval between; rounds.
There will be.no preliminary -.bouts; the ; finish fight ; making up the entire
card. ; The principals have agreed to be in the ring at 2 o'clock and the trouble
will. commence without delay. The? complete list of officials was
made- public to-day." James J. Jeffries- will ;be the referee;' Frank; Shorten,
official ; timekeeper; - : Albert Updike, timekeeper ; for \u25a0 Hart,^ and -.William . Nolan,
timekeeper I for . Root. ; Root's seconds will be \u25a0 Battling" Nelson, T. Alexander and

JAVA'S HEALTH
INSPECTOR HERE
â¢ Dr. Urban ich Conies to City
to Greet Daughter Who
Will Return With Him
Ore of the distinguished guests at the
St.. Francis Ho.el is Dr. Miroslav Urban
. ich of Prague. Bohemia, who is Â»n in
. fcpector In the service of The Xcther-
Jand* in the island of Java. He is await
ing 1 the departure of the Manchuria, on
which he will return to his post. The
doctor took a flying visit to San Fran
daeo lo meet his daughter, who is mak
ing & trip around the world, and will sail
with her father to his station in Java.
.Dr. Urbanich not only has the health
ol Java to look after, but his duties carry
h'.rn ' to Sumatra and Papua or Xew
Guinea and even to Singapore. In fact,
his Fphere of work Is limited only by the
boy:idc of the Malay archipelago. For
ihret:. : cars he has been looking after the
tanitary conditions in the archipelago,
">nd in Java in particular.
. Dr. l"rba:iich speaks of Java as an
island in need of capital to develop its
great resources. With the exception of
the fringe of coast the island Is still un
, opened, and in the interior are immeas
urable opportunities. Already German
and Dutch capital has become interested,
M but the companies seem to lack the en
ergy and direction that characterize the
British and American concerns.
. The health record of Java is good, with
the exception of that for- the rainy sea
son, which lasts for two months, and dur
ing which; it Is dangerous for a white
man to be out of doors. At that there 13
no bubonic plague in the island, the most
\u2666 prevalent diseases being berl-berl and
malaria.
Gold and silver are plentiful in the Inte
rior, but the companies working claims
at present iare poorly supplied .and the
iregions are inaccessible. I owing to poor
railroads. Trains are run'only during the
day. as the natives who operate the
roads arc not to be depended upon after
sundown.

MINNIE ADAMS
JURY DISAGREES
Aft^r Twenty-Seven Hours of
Discussion Members y l)e
. Clare Verdict: Impossible
TO' BE TRIED AGAIN
Filial Count Shows Seven for
> Conviction ;Five for
an Absolute Acquittal
The trlal_of Minnie; Adams.- the
woman who was accused and once con
victed.of murdering her little two
year-old boy by pouring carbolic
down his throat? in the year of 1599,
eameto an'abrupt end at; 6 o'clock-last
ni&ht when the- jurors announced'that
after; twenty-seven hours of discussion
they were /still unable.' to decide
whether or! not the woman was guilty
of "the crime chargred, and consequently
could not:fender a verdict; They jisked
to,, be dischargrd, -whereupon Judge
Lawlor released them. .-While no man
of the twelve will positively admit the
fact, yet: it is understood that seven
were' for conviction and five \ held out
for acquittal. â¢ '. s ! -* .
Although this, the. second jury to
pass judgment upon : Minnle Adams,
reached no decision, it does not signify
that she will go free." On the con
trary, she will have to undergo the
strain of a new trial, and that, almost
immediately. Judge Lawlor, has set
next Saturday afternoon at 3 o'clock
for" the new assignment. All the mass
of testimony will Ibe carefully gone
over ; once "more before ;a jury, and the
District Attorney' will again argue
along the same- lines as ho has : done
twice 'before. ..Meantime, the defendant
will* S o back to her : prison in the
County Jail, still maintaining her in
nocence of the terrible crime.
The weak, point in the prosecution
was the tangled .testimony of the wit
nesses who saw a woman,' supposed' to
be Mrs. 'Adams, buy the carbolic acid
on the Sunday night before the poison
ing. Patrolman Herllcke' swore
this woman boarded a â¢ car at 5:46
o'clock that evÂ«>ning : and-he. swore that
he reported it to headquarters -at- 8:50
o'clock. Motorman Cox swore that the
woman boarded his car. and the defense
proved beyond a. doubt that his car did
not pass Dcvisadero street drug store
until two minutes after 9 o'clock. This
discrepancy created a doubt Jn ..the.
minds of the jury whether Minnie
Adams bought the poison, and. this was
of important weight In the attempt to
reach a decision. : â¢

WANTS WHALE
IN A HARNESS
. The whale is still In the bay, and If the
project of Henry Peterson, the launch
man, .will work. thÂ« mammal will never
leave. Peterson saw the Whale when it
first announced its presence In the harbor
by racing past the Folsom-street dock 3
like a Russian . destroyer chased by the
Japs; \u25a0 -"\u25a0 ' "' ' '" ; 'â¢---\u25a0\u25a0â¢-. '. \u25a0'- -Â»
â¢Gee!" "remarked^ Peterson,'' "What a
fine ferry-boat that tellow would make."
The whale" went on and made Goat
Island in four minutes flat. That left Pe
terson thinking, and his contemplation
evolved "a scheme that may revolutionize
navigation.' - \V.'
â¢The horse was wild once, but he was
tamed and made to work. All land ani
mals were wild once. Nobody ever tried
to tame a sea animal, but that ain't say-,
ing it can't be done. Of course, it'vriir
take time." <:\
Peterson's '. imagination \u25a0 skipped the
minor details of catching and 'taming the
whale â¢to the days when he would be
president of the Whale Transit Company
of San ; Francisco. ; All, over the water
front would be signs reading: "Peter
son's whales are the fastest on' the bay."
"Peterson's whales â¢ run : to Oakland every
ilve minutes." v "Owl whales; run every
half-hour." .' pSSMSWH
"There's millions in it," cried Peterson,
awaking from .his reverie:
"Millions inwhat?'* asked his. boatman.
"Millions : in that whale if we can catch
him alive,'-' said Peterson, j
"That's easy, if you -want to go to the
expense," said the boatman.
"Tell me how to â¢ get that > fellow alive
and I'll deed you the business," said Pe
terson eagerly..- ?. , . i
"Well;" said the boatman, "get a bar 1
or laudanum andsneak out by the whale.
Just ; scatter it .along the water and .the
whal'll snuff it in through â¢ his gills. When
he's under' the! influence you â¢ makes fast
to i him ; wlth-'a' : line ; and. tow's him'to the
dock. Or else/ you can spill a few. bar'ls
of whisky;, and when . he gets , shot to ' the
bonnet of course he'll be. easy."
"I don't. want no- drunken, whales." ob
jected Peterson. .The' Peterson Transit
Company- was to â¢ have only, sober and re
liable whales in it 3 employ. "And I ain't
going to shanghai a' poor unsuspecting
fish. â¢ cither,", he added. ~ X-

The Kind You Have Always Bought
Signature of (^ut^/yfj^^U^
of the human eye. I Just stood up and
looked that whale right In the face. Ho
couldn't face my gaze. He dove, and
when he came up again we got his blub
ber. ' A whale- ain't going to hurt you If
you don't lose your presence of mind."
Just, then there' was a sudden splash
and a huge brown shape rose from the
water not forty feet from the boat.â It
was a whale.
The crew of the Whitehall shrieked In
chorus; "Chick" sank to- the bottom of
the beat. 'â\u25a0 '
"God forgive me, boys," he said. "I'm
not fit to die. I'm such an awful liar. It
J ever get out of this I'll never tell an
other." . \u25a0 KSSS2
The fishermen cut their anchor and did
not stop rowing till they reached Sauaa
lito. v *By.'that time they partly recovered
from the scare.
"How about thÂ© power of thÂ© human
eye, ; 'Chick?* "asked one of the fisher
men.
"Boys." said 'Chick' solemnly. "I saw
at; a glance that that whale was blind
as a bat." n
