MISS BURBANK IS DROPPED
FROM THE SERVICE.
Miss Agnita J. Burbank was dismissed from the Govern
ment service yesterday. She is supposed to have been
carrying secrets of the Chinese Bureau to her fiance,
Hippolyttus da Silva, who figured recently N in a scandal
concerning the importation of Chinese women. Miss Bur
bank stoutly denies the accusation made against her.
MISS AGNITA BURBANK. STENOGRAPHER IN CHINESE BUREAU WHO HAS
BEEN ORDERED DISMISSED BT THE GOVERNMENT BECAUSE OF HER
FRIENDSHIP FOR DA SIIA'A. WHO FIGURED IN FEDERAL SCANDAL
Accused of Betraying Department Secrets
Agnita J. Burbank, stenographer in
the Chinese Bureau, has been dropped
from the service by order of the de
partment at Washington. "For con
duct unbecoming a Government em
ploye and detrimental to the service,"
the order of dismissal reads. ,
The specific charge against Miss Bur
bank is that she "tipped off" secrets of
the department to Hippolyttus Amador
Lesola Boa da Sllva, the Portuguese
who was arrested several months ago
â¢>n the charge of smuggling Chinese
women into the country for immoral
purposes. Miss Burbank is Da Silva's
fiancee and Commissioner Hart North
believes that she has been keeping him
supplied with information which the
department wanted to keep secret.
Da Silva's movements showed that
he was getting "inside tips" and the
lHsioner decided that they came
trom Mies Burbank. He notified the
department at Washington and the
sti-n.jgrapher's dismissal was the re
suit.
ThÂ«= woman stoutly denies that the
charges are true. "Let them prove it!
They can furnish no proofs that 1 ever
told departmental secrets to anybody,"
she declared.
"My work has always been satis
factory. Even Mr. North admits that.
("haricK Meehan. the Chinese inspector
in charge, has told men since the occur
rence that 1 have always given perfect
satisfaction as an officer. Mr. North j
himself spoke highly of me to Com

more critically what he has done

URIAH, March 15.â Clark Hill, thir-.
teen years old, living on the South Eel
River, killed a panther Sunday that
measured twelve feet from tip to tip.
Young Hill waa out on the range and
came across the carcass of a steer that
had been killed and partly devoured by
some wild animal. Not knowing what
to <io, lip returned to the house for help.
Finding every one gone, he called his
dogs and started out and after several
hours' chase succeeded in treeing a
panther. As ht- was walking around
under the trep. trying to get a chance
for a shot, the panther sprung at him
and knocked him over. A desperate
fight ansued. The interference of the
dogs enabled the boy to regain his
gun and he succeeded in shooting the
panther in a vital spot. As the animal
was too big for him to handle, he cut
wme brush, on which he rolled the
carcass and attaching the crude litter
to his hors?, proceeded homeward in
triumph. The panther is the largest
specimen ever killed in the county. It
had been preying on the stock on
neighboring ranches for several
months. .

Of Tic Pass. The Russians repulsed
the attack and even made a small ad

ST. PETERSBURG. March 16 (2
a. m.).â Flanking' tactics by the Jap
anese apparently are in progress again,
a press correspondent who remains at
Tie Pass telegraphing that General
Mistchenko on March 11 engaged a
Japanese force on the Russian right. It
is possible that the attacking: force was
a Japanese column which disappeared
from observation during the battle of
Mukden. The Japanese do not appear
to have renewed the frontal attack up
to noon yesterday, the demonstration
on Tuesday having shown that the
Russians were prepared to make a de
termined resistance.
The ofiice of the censor has already
been removed (o Santoupou, eight
miles north of Tie Pass, and there ar?
intimations th;u it may soon be estab
lished even farther north. The press
correspondent, though saying nothing
regarding the commissariat arrange
ments for the troops, declared that the
newspaper correspondents have been
practically starved out of Tie Pass. This
may be an indication of the amount of
food available for the army, immense
quantities of which were destroyed at
Mukden, when* practically the entire
reserve commissariat had been accu
mulated.
RUMOR OF A MASSACRE.
Alleged MurdT of Foreigners by Chi

SANTon-OU, TEN MILES NORTH
OF TIE PASS, March 15 (noon).â lt is
rumored that after the evacuation of
Mukden by the Russians eighty for
eigners were killed by Chinese. Richard
H. Little, correspondent of the Chicago
Daily News, is reported to be among
those slain.
A message has been sent to Field
Marshal Oyama asking for information
concerning M. Nadeau, a French war
correspondent who accompanied Lit
tle. It has been reported here that
Nadeau was captured by the Japanese,
and Little may have met the same fate.
The rumor of the murder of eighty
foreigners is hoped and believed here
to be unfounded. It is assumed that
they have been captured by the Jap
anese.
CHICAGO, March 15.â Richard H.
Little cabled direct from Yinkow yes
terday to the Chicago Daily News. He
said he had been captured by the Jap
anese and was beinp taken to Kobe.
The cablegram contained references
which demonstrated that the message
v.as from Little personally and that he
was alive and well. Yinkow is the sea
port of Newchwang. and is the place
to which Little would naturally have
been en route to Japan.

The detectives and local representa

ment of President Jordan and Tim
othy Hopkins that, in their opinion,
Bv'rs. Stanford died from natural
CSttsea. Their vigor in prosecuting in
vestigation of the mystery will not be
abated in the least as the result of the
cabied explanation that came from
Honolulu yesterday. Attorney Mount
foixi Wilson said:
W> are net guided altogether by opinions.
â While we-jpht mast be attached to them, of
Course, they do not isolve the mystery In which
the v.hoie case is enshrouded. \\ . have not

who!* mutter,
T\> have ntithc-r accepted any theory nor
sbar.'ior.i-d any. He are virtually in the same
position mm were before our representatives
began thtir investigations in Honolulu. It
looks, to me as if Uiere can no conclusion
at k-ast before we get the transcripts at the
testimony ar.d statements of the evidence
gathered in the islands.
XtM report Beet out from Honolulu that thÂ«
t?;ar.lord rerrtFeiitatives were endeavoring to
have the theory cf natural causes adopted ia
utterly without foundation. The interest of

\W 6o not wish to prosecute any one for
murJtr if a '.Tirm ha* not been committed.
Xor are we willing that the poisoner shall
**cap* if murder was committed. We are
trying hard to get at the facts and I have
hopei- that we shall he able to do so.
Mr. Wilson said the only word he
had received from Honolulu during the
day was a cablegram from President
Jordan, in which he briefly set forth
his opinion that Mrs. Stanford died
from natural < a uses.
Captain Burnett s course in connec
tion with the case is not to be changed
by the opinions of Jordan and Hop
kins. He is much dissatisfied with the
conflicting reports that have been com
ing froni Honolulu, and now declares
that th?re can be no change in his at
titude toward the investigation until
Detective* Caliundan and Reynolds ar
rive. Burnett and Wilson have both
tome to the conclusion, apparently,
that the only report or opinion they
â¢in accept from Honolulu is that of
the two detectives, who will arrive in
about six days.
Burnett revived no communication
from Reynolds yesterday. It was
through a cablegram from Detective
CaDundan to the Morse agency that the
head of the city's detective department
learned of the departure of his subor
dinate from the islands yesterday. The
message read:
' "Investigation satisfactory. Leave
to-day. Notify Spillane."
â¢'What does Caliundan mean by 'in
vestigation satisfactory?' "
"Mystery worse confounded," vouch
safed Wilson.
"Give it up," said Burnett.
"Caliundan merely means that he
has covered the field satisfactorily,"
was Harry Morse's explanation.

Say Strychnine Was
Probably Used
as Tonic
HONOLULU. March 15.â The fol- '
I lowing joint statement, signed by Dr. j
i Jordan and Mr. Hopkins, was left with â¢
â¢ Judge Smith, with instructions to re- !
j leas?' It after the sailing of the Ala
i nieda :
! "in our judgment, after a careful I
I consideration of all the facts brought!
Jto our knowledge, we are fully con^ j
â  vinced that the death of Mrs. Stan- i
| ford was not due to strychnine poison*
' ing nor to intentional wrongdoing on
i the part of any one. '
"We find in the statements of those ,
who were with Mrs. Stanford in her |
j last moments no evidence that any of
: the characteristic symptoms of strych- I
1 nine poisoning were present.
"We think i' probable that death '
' was due to a combination of conditions
I and circumstances. Among these we
; may note in connection with her ad- j
; vane-ed age the unaccustomed exer
; lion, the surfeit of unsuitable food and
the unusual exposure during the pic
nic u> which she went on the day of i
her death. :
j "These conditions were perhaps j
somewhat aggravated by the presence
of strychnine and other drugs in the
i medicinal capsule and possibly also by
the presence of the small amount of
; strychnine contained in the dose of
bicarbonate of soda,
"The occurrence of this strychnine
Ui the bicarbonate of soda has not yet
been explained. The fact that it was j
not in excess of usual medicinal pro- |
I portions suggests that its presence was |
I due either to the error of a pharmacist
or else that the combination waa pre
pared for tonic purposes.
"We must recognize that the pre
liminary hypothesis of accidental
poisoning seemed a natural one under
the extraordinary circumstances. We j
regard it, however, as being without
foundation and wholly incompatible
with the evidence in our possession.
"We cannot express in too high
terms, our appreciation of the gener
ous sympathy and friendly hospitality
shown by all the people of Hawaii
with whom we have come in contact.
We came to Honolulu on the saddest
of errands and leave it with the warm
est feelings >f gratitude toward this
I beautiful island, this generous-hearted

, citizens."
LOOKS FOR A SOLUTION.
Callundan Says He Expects the Mys
tery Will Be Unraveled.
HONOLULU, March 15.â "You can |
take all the facts and fit them to four j
or five theories." said Captain Jules
Callundan, representing a San Fran
cisco detective agency, to the corre
spondent of the Associated' Press this
morning in speaking of the death of
Mrs. Stanford. "I hope that very soon
after our arrival at San Francisco we
will find the solution of the mystery,"
he added.
Deputy High Sheriff Rawlins will
not go to San Francisco on the Ala
meda, contrary to expectations.
The detectives are of the opinion
that the verdict of the Coroner's jury,
to the effect that Mrs. Stanford died
b> strychnine poisoning, was not jus
tified by the evidence presented.
High Sheriff Henry, in an interview,
accuses the San Francisco detectives
of an intention to discredit the work
of his department. He says he sup
poses they will endeavor to make it
I appear that Mrs. Stanford died from
natural causes.
The evidence up to date, it is point
ed out, indicates that Mrs. Stanford
took one-seventh of a grain of strych
nine, this quantity being combined in
the cascara capsule and the bicarbon
ate of soda; that both the capsule and
the soda would be required to cause a
fatal result, 9nd that both would be
ff.tal only to a person of Mrs. Stan
ford's age.
JORDAN CORRECTS HIMSELF.
Orders Sonvnvhat Startling Cable

HONOLULU, March 15. â Judge
Smith received from Dr. Jordan a
message to be sent by cable to Mount
ford S. Wilson at San Francisco im
r.-iediately after the sailing of the Ala
meda. This message was to the effect
that Miss Berner took the same dose
of the bicarbonate of soda adminis
tered to Mrs. Stanford and also one of
the cascara capsules at the same time
Mrs. Stanford did, without showing
any signs of discomfort. Just before
the sailing of the Alameda, however,
Judge Smith received by telephone
from Dr. Jordan at the wharf a mes
sage instructing him to withdraw the
dispatch from the cable office, or. if
it had been sent, to contradict it. The
cablegram was not forwarded.

HONOLULU, March 15.â The joint

Timothy Hopkins to the effect that in
their opinion Mrs. Stanford died from

Sheriff Henry is pronounced in his
views that they were not guided by
the evidence in the case.

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, MARCH 16. 1905.
Funeral Services Held
Before Alameda
Departs.
HONOLULU, March 15.â The remains
of Mrs. Jane Lathrop Stanford, who
died at the Moana Hotel here on the
night of February 28, v.ere escorted
this morning from the undertaking es
tablishment, where they have lain
sine.2 the morning following the death,
to the Congregational Central Union
Church by the officials of the police de
partment, other Territorial officials, a
large number of citizens and the fol
lowing pallbearers: Dr. David Starr
Jordan, president of Stanford Univer
sity: Timothy J. Hopkins, a member
of the board of trustees of the univer
sity; Governor Carter; United States
District Judge Dole; Carl Smith, a
member of the House of Representa
tives; J. F. Haekfeld, representing the
Stanford interests here; C. M. Cooke.
president of the Bank of Hawaii, and
â¢ 'harles Dole. A. Lewis and D. L.
Vandine, alumni of Stanford Univer
sity, as well as by many graduates of
the university resident in Honolulu.
The rhurc-h. which is one o| the larg
est in Honolulu, was crowded.
The procession was met at the church
entrance by Right Rev. Henry Bond
Restarick, Episcopal Bishop of Ha
waii, and Rev. William M. Kincaid.
The services were opened by the Rev.
Mr. Kimaid and the Episcopal burial
service was read by Bishop Restarick.
The choir sang "Beneath the Cross of
Jesus," "Nearer, My God, to Thee,"
and "Lead. Kindly Light," which were
favorite hymns of Mrs. Stanford.
At the conclusion of the service the
funeral cortege, which included the
pallbearers, the choir. Bishop Restar
ick and Rev. Mr. Kincaid, the police es
cort and many prominent citizens, pro
ceeded to the wharf, where there was
an immense gathering of people. The
remains were placed on board the
steamer Alameda through a port. The
casket was surrounded with violet and
black drapery and covered with fresh
violets. Captain Dodwell received the
remains, standing at the portway with
uncovered head. The steamer's flag
was at half-mast and a similar mark
of respect was paid by other vessels
in the harbor.
A number of splendid floral pieces,
sent by Californians, members of the
university alumni, and others were
placed about the casket.
President Jrrrdan and University
Trustee Timothy Hopkins followed tMe
remains.
The Alameda then left the wharf and
began her voyage to San Francisco.
The usual concert by the Government
band on the steamer's sailing was dis
pensed with, and her departure seemed
like the closing scene of a funeral.
Bertha Berner and May Hunt, secre
tary and maid, respectively, to Mrs.
Stanford, were present at the funeral,
each in deep mourning garb. Miss
Berner especially displayed intense
grief. They were escorted aboard the
Alameda by Deputy Sheriff Rawllns.

Passed to Immortality,
February 28, 1905.
These are the words that have just
been carved on the central of three
marble coffins that rest in the mauso
leum on the Stanford estate. This
sarcophagus lies empty, waiting for
the body of Mrs. Stanford. On the
right is the sealed tomb of Senator
â¢Stanford and on the left is that of
Leland Stanford Jr., in whose mem
ory the loving parents founded the
university. On each Is written the
date of birth and the date of death.
The one in the center has for many
years borne the name of Mrs. Stan
ford and the date of her birth, but the
line for the inscription of the day of
her death was until to-day left in
blank.
While the funeral arrangements for J
the body of Mrs. Stanford have not j
yet been made public, it is known j
that they will be very simple. It is I
probable that there will be a family |
service at the home in the morning I
and an open service in the Memorial
Church in the afternoon. The stu- I
dents will not go in a body to San
Francisco, as was planned, nor will
they escort the body of their well
loved founder from the train in Palo
Alto to the. university. The services !
themselves will be short and simple. \
Charles G. Lathrop has not yet an
nounced the name of the minister who
will give the address at the funeral.
Chaplain Gardner is slightly better
and the attending physicians now
have hopes of his ultimate recovery.
They have not yet dared to tell him
of the death of Mrs. Stanford for fear
that he could not survive the shock.

No further news has been received
of the fighting on the Fan River, and
little importance is attached to this
isolated repulse of the Japanese. The
London papers continue in the belief
that to all intents and purposes the
campaign is closed; that it will be
next to impossible for Russia to put a
new army into the field, and that the
talk of doing so is mere bluff, intended
to influence the inevitable negotiation
of peace terms. It is also believed that
the French Government has utilized
the financial lever to convey to Russia
her views that the proper course is to
arrange terms. The rumor persists that
Russia has acquainted Prance with her
willingness to discuss terms, but not on
the basis of an indemnity, which, Rus
sia contends, would ruin her prestige,
claiming that she would rather con
tinue the war than submit to such a
demand.
Reports as to the progress of the
loan negotiations are conflicting. It \b
asserted that the French syndicate has
offered to take the loan at 90 instead of
95 per cent, the price at which the
previous loan was taken, but that Rus
sia has refused to consider anything
under 94. It is also reported that Rus
sia has threatened to remove the cash
balance of $100,000,000 standing in Paris
as a means of aiding the French syndi
cate.
Discussing peace prospects, the
Morning Post to-day warns Great

TOKIO, March 16. â The Emperor

"Since autumn the enemy erected
strong defenses around Mukden, held
the district with a superior force and
were confident of victory. Our Man
churian ajmies, however, forestalling
the enemy, boldly and vigorously as

ously fighting for more than ten days

wind, defeated their strong foes, driv
inv them to Tie Pusa, faking tena .of
thousands of prisoners and otherwise
inflicting serious injuries. By this
signal victory our Manchurian armies
have enhanced the military prestige of
our country at home and abroad. We
are deeply gratified by the courage

and men have been able to achieve
such a great success, and we look to
you for even greater exertions in the
future."
STEAMSHIP TACOMA A PRIZE.
Escapes From the Ice Only to Be Cap-
tured by Japanese.
TOKIO, March 15. â The American
steamship Tacoma was seized by the
Japanese guardships yesterday. Noth
ing is yet known of the adventures of
the vessel since she was first reported
to have been caught in the ice north
of the island of Hokkaido. It is pre
sumed that the ice either melted or
broke, freeing the Tacoma, which was
immediately seized by the Japanese
guardships.
The Tacoma Is an Iron screw
steamship of 2812 tons register. She
is owned by the Northwestern Com
mercial Steamship Company of Seat
tle, from which port she sailed on
January 6 with a cargo of barreled
beef for Vladivostok, it is said, al
though ostensibly for Shanghai. When
last reported the Tacoma was fast in
the Ice north of Hokkaido Island,
with Japanese ships lying in wait to
pick her up when she worked clear.

REFUSAL OF FRENCH BANKS TO GIVE
FURTHER AID TO RUSSIA PROBABLY
DUE TO PRESSURE BY THE MINISTRY
Premier Rouvier Finds a Way to Force
Republics Ally to End Disastrous War.
PARIS, March 15.â The postpone
ment of the Russian loan is definitely
confirmed. This is likely to exert a
powerful influence toward peace, as it
Is the first time the French financiers
have shown an indisposition to advance
funds while the uncertainties of war
continue.
It is authoritatively denied in the
highest Russian quarters that the
French Government exercised any
pressure toward preventing the in
crease of French holdings of Russian
securities. Nevertheless it is probable
that some members of the Government,
acting individually, voiced the prevail
ing view that caution was advisable.
Since Rouvier has combined in himself
the presidency of the Council of Min
isters and the Ministry of Finance the
Government has indirectly exercised
strong influence on private financial
affairs. It is siÂ§miflcant that the post
ponement of the loan is coincident with
a strong move of the influential French
press favorable to peace.
ST. PETERSBURG YET HOPES.
ST., PETERSBURG^ March 15.â At
the Ministry of Finance it was said to
day that negotiations for a new Rus
sian loan of $125,000,000 in France were
expected to be concluded and signed in
Paris in ten days. French bankers
who have been here in connection with
the negotiations left St. Petersburg
yesterday. It is pointed out, however,
that this does not mean that the ne
gotiations are broken off, the same pro
cedure having been observed in the
case of the $160,000,000 loan last spring,
when, after the negotiations in St.
Petersburg, the representatives return
ed to Paris, whera the contract was
signed within a fortnight.
Nevertheless the pressis in a position
to assert that the Paris financiers have
been pressing for peace, justifying their
attitude on the ground of the enor
mous French commitments in Russian
funds, and these representations have
been renewed since the news of Gen
eral Kuropatkin's defeat. Their atti
tude might exercise great Influence on
the ultimate decision of the Govern
ment.
LORD ROTHSCHILD'S VIEWS.
LONDON. March 15.â Lord Roths
child regards the postponement of the
Russian loan as tantamount to a re
fusal on the part of the French syndi
cate to treat any further.
"After all," he said, "it cannot be a
matter for surprise. It is owing to the
force of circumstances, and not, I
think, to the result of pressure on the
part of the French Government in the
interests of peace. Between $2,500,000,
(00 and 53,000,u00.000 of French money
is invested in Russia, There is nothing
more natural at the present time, with
the affairs of Russia in the state that
they are, both at home and abroad,
than that it should become difficult to
iind subscribers in France to another
Russian loan. 1 think it is force of
circumstances and not pressure tend
ing to peace on the part of the French
Government. '
Li>rd Rothschild said it was difficult
to say where Russia would find the
money to continue the war.
LIKE A BLUNDBERINa YOKED.
War Writer Says the Russian Army
Will "Win No Victories.
ST. PETERSBURG, March 15.âKiri
loff, one of the Associated IJress corre
spondents, who was wounded at Liao
yang.continuing to-day his description
begun yesterday of the causes of the
Russian defeats, has drawn a powerful
picture of the complete criminal lack
of knowledge on the part of the Rus
sians of the country and the enemy's
I movements, and of the utter imprudent
possip and babbling which acquaints
the Japanese with every movement and
I plan before they are inaugurated. He
: compares the Russian army to a pow
\ erful yokel moving forward blindfolded,
wildly brandishing his arms and shout
| ing aloud what he will do to the enemy
I when he catches him. He cannot see
his path or his enemy. Here he
I stumbles up a hill. There he falls into
a valley. The keen-eyed enemy easily
: avoids his waving arms pid mighty
fists, and pour 3ln a succession of blows
! which send the Russian yokel reeling
j backward, to his bitter astonishment.
Kiriloff adds that the blame for the
auccebsive defeats is not Kuropatkin's.
! It is simply due to the fact that the
! machine is out of order. A good work
i man was given bad helpers and miser
able tools. The elements of misfortune
were in the army Itself. Behold the
result! The mishaps were attributed
to the defensive position of Kuropatkln
and it was said that when the Rus-
s ians assumed the initiative all would
I be \v> 11. This was not realized, be
j cause every movement was preordain
ed to failure by the premature publica
! tion or dilatory execution of the plans.
! The mere stripling sub-lieutenant chat
| ters recklessly and informally of dis
' positions and movements which should
be known only to the few chiefs. The
1 disposition and plans of the battle of
j the Shakhe River, for example, were
i openly discussed several days In ad
vance In the railroad restaurant at
Mukden in the hearing of many Cht
! nese, civilians and camp followers.
â¢'The general staff gives information
to whomsoever asks for it. Babbling Is
! the bane of the bureaucracy," says Ki
< riloff, "and the sooner It is corrected
I the better."
While thus opening the Japanese
! eyes,' the Russians close theirs. Not
i only company and battalion command
j ers, but even colonels and at times
commanders of divisions, enter into
battle ignorant of the very maneuvers
j they are expected to execute. For mi
i stance. General Orloff on September 2
I was intrusted with the movement on
; which the battle of Liaoyang hinged
| and he blindly led 15,000 men into bat
! tie ignorant of why, wherefore or
whither. Naturally there was a disas-
I ter instead of the destruction of Gen-
I eral Kuroki's forces and a victory.
The general staff is inattentive to the
all-important duty of mapping. Even
now the Russians have unsatisfactory
maps, and units in the hill country are
unable to keep in touch with one an
other. The Russian intelligence de
partment is defective. It knows noth
ing of the Japanese numbers, positions
or movements, not only in the unset
tled mountainous regions, but even on
the populated plains of Manchuria.
Instead of easily winning the sympa
thy of the Chinese the Russians alien
ated them and they now side with the
Japanese. The Russians drove away
the Chinese bandits, who are now the
eyes of the Japanese army and who de
stroy bridges and communications as
well.
Kuropatkln is hampered by frantic
reports from nervous generals, particu
larly those of Rennenkampff, who sends
"poems instead of results."
The late Lieutenant General Keller
also was at fault. Kuropatkin was
obliged to reprimand him sharply a
short time before his death.
These faults existed and still exist.
The army has been defeated and will
be in the future unless they be reme
died.
SAYS PEACE IS IMPOSSIBLE.
Prince Rhilkoff Declares Russia Must
Continue the War.
ST. PETERSBURG, March 15. â
Minister of Railroads Prince Khilkoff
in an interview to-day declared he
I.erscnally would welcome peace, but
it was difficult to see how it was pos
sible. To end the war under the pres
ent circumstances, he insisted, would
be shameful. A peace which would
surrender Russia's position in the Far
East, after tha sacrifices of blood and
treasure made to attain it, and which
would involve the complete loss of
Russia's prestige throughout the
world, would be folly. It were bet
ter to go on fighting.
The Prince expressed the hope that
the disaster to the army was not as
bad as represented abroad. He had
received a business telegram from
General Kuropatkin yesterday, which
indicated that the commander in chief
was calm and was handling the rail
read situation skillfully.
Personally the Prince was surprised
that Kuropatkin allowed himself to be
drawn Into a general engagement at
Mukden, as he knew the Japanese
vere in superior numbers by 75,000
men. Besides, the Russian had Chi
nese under guise of bandits to reckon
with.

Special Correspondence oj The Call.
LONDON*. March 15.â 1f only it could
be told in full, there is little doubt that
the story of how a London barmaid of
obscure parentage attained social
prominence and just missed becoming
a marchioness would be about as dra
matic and sensational as anything In
fiction.
Starting out with nothing but a pret
ty face, this daughter of the people
eventually got together money enough
; to set ui> a luxurious establishment.
She contrived to get her name enshrin
ed in the ark of the covenant of the
British aristocracy â Peerage â
' && the daughter of a Spanish viscom
tesse, whose title she claimed to have
inherited, and a highly connected de
ceased officer in the British navy. She
made people believe that she was the
widow of p. "wealthy man, who was the
son of an English baronet And finally
she came within an ace of wedding
one of the proudest titles in England. I
â¢Because of the sudden withdrawal of j
her suit for breach of ; remise against I
the Marquis of Townshend, before her ]
counsel had concluded' his opening
speech, the greater part of this story ;
will probably never be written. But
what has been revealed of it is uncom
monly Interesting. The unexpected de
nouement of course admits of only one |
conclusion that Mrs. Evelyn Diana j
Tumour Sheffield, as she styles herself, J
dared not face the evidence which the '
other side was prepared to bring for- ,
ward to sustain their allegations that j
she Man impostor and an adventur
es?.
HIS FORMAL PROPOSAL.
It was in the summer of 1903 that she
* first met the Marquis. Less than three
- months sufficed to bring him to her
feet. Whatever her life had been, her
youthful good looks were sufficiently
well preserved to enable her to pass for
a dashing and sprightly widow, a good
five years younger than the forty years ,
to which she now pleads guilty. While
the nobleman wooed, the woman, ac
cording to her counsel, paid the bills
for suppers and various entertain- '
ments which they attended.
"No dcubt," said the lawyer, "he as- ;
sumed that she was a wealthy widow,
and as she had been to New York he
Imagined that she was overflowing
with money."
Th^re was not much display of sen- !
timentality in his proposal of marriage. .
This is what he wrote:
My Dear Mrs. Sheffieldâ SineÂ« I first had
the r'lfasure of Â«eeing you and Joying your ;
Rindne^g and hospitality I have not only looked
gladly forward to every visit I have paid you.

friend I have always needed â warrn-heartetl,

I now write to ark you If you will do that

* She told him srre would when he
to get his answer. It may be
"assumed that her acceptance of the
nfTer was couched In more ardent lan- !
guage than he had employed in mak- j
ing it. That she might lose no time j
in setting about the task of rendering
him "permanently happy, and incident
ally becoming a Marchioness, the date
of the wedding- was fixed for only
eleven days later.
ASKS FOB FORTUNE.
One can well Imagine that those j
eleven days were the most anxious j
ones of her life. She had played her '
cards with consummate skill. As the 'â¢
Marchioness of Townshend her posi

her pretensions of birth there could .

UARMAID. WHO TRAPPED A
MARQUIS, BUT LOST HIM.

ever over what the Marquis' law
yers declared they were prepared to
prove that her mother was a domestic
find her father a saloon-keeper.
But marriages in high life usually
involve monetary settlements and the
Marquis apparently was more eager to
find out how much he was marrying
than just whom he was marrying.
According to the widow's counsel, it
was only a few days after their mutual
vows of affection had been exchanged
that he broached the cash question to
his betrothed. He told her that he
could make no settlement upon her
as his titles constituted his chief as
rets. but that she would be assured
of a Jointure of |7500 a year at his
death. Then he wanted to know how
much she was prepared to give him.
He made the extraordinary proposi
tion. Mrs. Sheffield's lawyer declared,
'that she should settle $25,000 on the
Rev. Arthur Gerard Robins, his pri
vate secretary, and $50,000 on Robins'
12-year-old boy. There is some mys
tery here which the collapse of the
! o;ise left unexplained. Noblemen,
â  especially impecunious ones, are not
! usually solicitous about the financial
, future of their private secretaries. It
â  was through Robins that the Marquis
met the supposed widow and It has
been plausibly suggested that the
money which it was proposed should
be settled on him and his boy repre
i sented the commission.
MIT FOIXOWS BREAK.
However that may be, the woman
objected to disposing of any of her
money that way. Even when marry
ing a Marquis she said it was not us
ual to make settlements on his
friends. Then in, stepped the Marquis*
: solicitor with the reauest that fine
should show what securities she pos
sessed. She demurred again, proba
bly realizing that she could not raise
the price at which Marquises are
quoted in the matrimonial market.
The solicitor departed with his curi
osity unsatisfied and a rather dismal
luncheon party followed, at which the
i Marquis, it is averred, despite his
1 coronet and his thirty-eight years,
Phed tears.
Probably the woman would ha
1 landed him if she had been left to
manage him alone, but the man ot
the law had had his suspicions arous
ed and started an investigation at
, Somerset House, where wills and
i other things that reveal people's ped
i igrees and inheritances are filed. The
! result was thÂ«* Marauis of Townshend

j herself for the loss of a coronet Mrs.

"All the statements that have been
I made with regard to her marriage,
i her connections, her birth and her
j property are a tissue of lies from be
i ginning to end," said the counsel for
I the Marquis, after the widow's law
yer had made the startling announce
ment that he would proceed no fur
ther with the case.
Society will hear no more of Mrs.
; Sheffield. She is remarkably clever,
i but the breach of promise suit was a
fatal mistake. She will never get a
chance to play the matrimonial game
for high stakes again. But if she
could be induced to write the true
story of her life it would have a great
sale.
MARQI'IS PENNILESS.
The Marquis 'of Townshend, although
he owns some 20,000 acres, is one of the
most impecuious members of the Brit
ish peerage. He succeeded to the title
on his father's death in 1899. The es

receiver was appointed. Last year the

WAR IS THEME
IN REICHSTAG
Yon Bulow States That It 13
the Policy of Germany to
Maintain Her Neutrality
HAS NO DEEP SCHEMES
He Scores Socialists for
Their Attitude in Desiring
a Clash With Russians
BERLIN, March 15.â Chancellor yon
Bulow, speaking in the Reichstag to
day, on a resolution asking the Gov
ernment to give Alsace-Lorraine inde
pendent representation in the Bundes
rath, said it would be necessary to seek
the views of all the confederated states.
For the Viceroy of Alsace-Lorraine to
have power to appoint representatives
in the Bundesrath would virtually give
Prussia power in the Bundesrath not
contemplated by the constitution, he
said.
Later he said, replying to Herr yon
Volmar (Socialist), who criticized the
Government for its complaisant atti
tude toward Russia in regard to the
sale of merchant ships and the expul
sion of refugees, the Chancellor said in
part:
"Herr yon Volmar. who watches for
eign events with close attention, must
have seen that the French Republicans
j and the French Democrats still give
i the. greatest care to the alliance be
j tween France and Russia. The Eng
i lish Liberals have a lively wish that
j good relations should exist between
i Great Britain and Russia, and those in
! other lands believe that the position of
Russia as a great power will continue
beyond the incidents of the war and in
ternal disquiet."
This statement was greeted with
cries of "No, No!" from the left party.
! Chancellor yon Bulow said further:
"The Social-Democrats desire war
j with Russia. I regret to say that they
i have the intention to set such a cotiflict
j ablaze and cook their party soup over
; the flames."
The Chancellor read a clipping from
a Socialist paper, the Schwaet-ische
Tagewachf saying that if the Socialists
controlled the Government armed
forces would cross the frontier and free
their Russian brothers. Yon Buiow
coiUiitvod:
"For the second time Herr yon Vol
mar has spoken of German's depend
ence on Russia. He repeats this re
proach, although I have so often de
clared that we are not dependent on
Russia and that we do not run after
her, but that we also have no occa
sion to be unpleasant toward her, as
many persons wish. Twenty and forty '
years ago these same attacks were j
made on Prince Bismark. I remember !
Bismarck once said in debate that he ]
had learned from such attacks on the j
foreign policy how dangerous it was !
for persons who were not exactly in- !
formed upon foreign questions to speak !
of them."
Turning to the sale of merchant
ships to Russia, the Chancellor said
that both belligerents had bought nu
merous trading vessels, the private
property of neutrals.
"We have been reproached by both
sides," said the Chancellor. "They
say on one side that we have inclined
toward Russia and-from the other side
it is said that we desire that Russia
may be weakened by a long continu
ance of the war. One charge is as un
founded as the other. Both Govern
ments know where we stand. Japan
knows she can count on our strict neu- ;
trality."
"The Japanese Foreign Minister,"
continued Yon Bulow, "has said he has
no ground for suspicion or complaint
against Germany. He laid great value
upon the good relations with Germany.
There is no possibility of a collision
between Germany and Japan. The
Russian Government also knows that i
Germany does not intend to use '
against her the difficulties in which
she is entangled, nor even make her
feel uncomfortable."
LETTER FROM JEFF DAVIS
TO PIERCE DISCOVERED
In It the Writer Tells of His Atti
tude Toward the
Union.
HILLSBORO. N. H., March 15.â A
nephew of President Franklin Pierce
has found an autograph letter written
by Jefferson Davis to Pierce among
documents inherited from his uncle.
Davis wrote from the Senate cham
ber under date of January 30, 1860,
saying:
The prespect for our country In not lens
gloomy than when you left. I will stand by
the flag and uphold the constitution while
there is a possibility of effecting anything to
preserve and perpetuate the Government we
inherited. Beyond that my duty and faith
bind me to MlssiaMppl and her fortunes aa
ehe may shape them.
BUSINESS SUSPENDED
IN CAUSE OF RELIGION
Residents of Illinois Town Close Shops
to Attend a Revival
Meeting.
DIXON, 111., March 15. â For two
hours this afternoon no business was
transacted in Dixon. Everything was
suspended that proprietors and em
ployes might participate in a prayer
service held in the huge tabernacle
in which Evangelist William A. Sun
day is conducting a revival campaign.
The revival in this city has been
one of the greatest religious move
ments ever held here and extraordin
ary developments are coming to light
during this closing week. In the last
two weeks the evangelist has had 607
conversions.
Marquis obtained permission to sell
some of his ancestor's portraits and
other family heirlooms, valued in all
at $100,000, that he might raise money
enough to sustain his title in an appro
priate manner. It was then stated that
his income was only $1000 â just half
what the official receiver of his prop
erty was paid.
He is a pale-faced, immature looking
man ,who gives no promise of ever
amounting to anything, but he can
boast some famous ancestors. One of
these distinguished himself In the fight
against the Spanish Armada; another
at Cadiz: another was one of the
twelve delegates sent to request Charles j
II to return to England. Yet another
served at Dettingen, Fontenoy and
Culloden, took over the command at I
Quebec after the death of Wolfe and
later became Viceroy of Ireland. To
another ancestor belongs the distinction '
of having first introduced the turnip j
into this country.
His Norfolk seat, Raynham Hall, is '
one of the finest in the country and it
rejoices in an extremely well authenti
cated ghost. This is the apparition of
Lady Dorothy Walpole. second wife of
the Viscount who flourished late In the '
eighteenth century. Her marital life
was such an unhappy one that she lost
her reason and was confined in arr*\ip
per story at Raynham. Her appear
ance is said to herald a death either in
the Townshend or Walpole family.
BALFOUR TRIES
TO END DEBATE
Stirs Up Storm in Com
mons by the Introduc
tion of the "Guillotine"
IS BITTERLY ATTACKED
Premier Seeks to Compel
Sanctioning' of the Supply
Estimates Before March 31
LONDON, March 15.â Premier Bal
four Introduced the "guillotine" in the
House of Commons this afternoon with
the object of obtaining the sanctioning
of the estimates before March 31. In
moving the closure of the proceedings
on supply, the Premier declared that
it was necessary in order to secure the
requisite votes before the close of the
fiscal year. The step taken was for the
credit of the House and not to extricate
the Government from difficulty. Pro
longed debates delayed business and
the closure was more in consonance
with the dignity of the House than the
suspension of the 12 o'clock rule, the
vision of bedraggled members of Par
liament going home at 10 o'clock in
the morning not being calculated to
raise the reputation of the House of
Commons.
Asquith (Liberal), in a few caustic
sentences, moved the adjournment. He
declared Balfour's motion was a par
liamentary scandal and the greatest
outrage ever offered by a "nominally"
responsible minister to a "nominally"
deliberative assembly. He accused the
Government of mismanagement and
the Premier of encroaching on the
powers and privileges of the House and
said the motion marked an epoch in the
degradation of the House of Commons
from a deliberative to a dependent
body, transformed into an automatic
machine to register the will of the ex
ecutive.
The motion to adjoufn was defeated
by 266 votes to 206.
Raymond moved an amendment that
the House decline to sanction any pro
posals for further curtailing the discus
sion of supply. The amendment was
debated up to 7:30 o'clock, when Bal
four moved the closure, which was car
ried. 249 to 213.
Raymond's amendment was then de
feated by a majority of 40.
The debate on Balfour's ''guillotine"
motion will be resumed to-morrow.
COPYRIGHT ARRANGEMENT
DISASTROUS TO GERMANS
Novels Selling in America for 5
Cents Bring $4 12 In the
Fatherland.
BERLIN, March 15. â In the Reich
stag to-day Dr. Mueller of Melningen
referred to the copyright arrangement
between Germany and the United
States, characterizing the agreement
of January 15, 1902, as "nothing less
than a free gift of German intellectual
property to Americans." He said a
volume of George Ebers' novels sold
in the United States for 5 cents and in
Germany from $2 50 to (4 12. An en
tire book by Wilhelm Bush, given
gratis as a Sunday supplement of a
German-American newspaper, cost in
Germany 76 cents.
"German industrial art," the speaker
said, "Is exposed to the danger of suf
fering great losses in the United States.
Present conditions are wholly unten
able and must be completely overhaul
ed. Either the United States must ac
cede to the Berne convention or we
must have not merely a formal but a
material guarantee of legal protec
tion."
FRENCH CABLE COMPANY
TO BE FULLY PROTECTED
j Paris Government Will Prevent Ar
bitrary Action by Dictator
Castro.
PARIS, March 15.â The French Cable
i Company has committed its interests
i in Venezuela to the care of the French
I Government, which has given assur
ances that it will afford the company
j full protection against any arbitrary
! action.
The concession of the French Cable
I Company dates from 1895. The cornpa
iny has spent more than $1,200,000,
which has not yet yielded a? dividend.
: Lately the operation of the concession
j has been attended by many petty an
noyances. Under the pretext that the
company has not fulfilled the terms of
its concessions, President Castro
brought the case before a court and se
cured a verdict against the company,
: which was appealed to a higher court,
where it is still pending. If the cable
has been seized or cut it is assumed
that it will turn out to be part of the
I harassing attitude so long employed.
INDICTED FOR ALLEGED
BOODLING AND PERJURY
Former Lieutenant Governor Lee of
Missouri One of a Trio of
Accused Men.
JEFFERSON CITY. Mo., March 15.
The Cole Grand Jury which was or
dered by Judge Martin to Investigate
charges of legislative bribery, to-night
returned indictments against State
Senators Frank H. Farris and Charles
A. Smith on charges of accepting
bribes of $100 each from Daniel J.
Kelly, legislative agent of the so-called
baking powder trust, for defeating the
alum bill in the Legislature of 1901.
Former Lieutenant Governor John
A. Lee, who is at present residing in
Chicago, was indicted upon a charge
of perjury in connection with the alum
deal. It was upon statements made by
Lee that Indictments were returned
against Farris and Smith several
months ago.
The reason for the indictments
against Farris and Smith is that, in
the opinion of Attorney General Had
ley, those under which they are now
awaiting trial are defective.

IN A TANGLE
OVER TREATY
Republican Leaders in the
Senate at a Loss for a Plan
to Prevent Its Defeat
WASHINGTON, March 15.âRepubli
can leaders of the Senate are all at sea
respecting the action advisable in re
gard to the Santo Domingo treaty.
Recognizing that the Democrats con
trol more than one-third of the votes
and that two-thirds are required to
ratify the convention, the sentiment of
the Republican leaders is that the
treaty should be withdrawn by the
President. On this subject the Senate
and the President do not agree, and
the idea prevails that after one or two
days more of inconsequential discussion
the special session of the Senate will be
allowed to adjourn without date and
the treaty lapse. But this plan is not
popular in the Senate and a. way to
avoid it is being sought.
One alternative, which in the discus
sion concerning it was termed merely
an excuse for inaction, is that Senator
Cullom, as chairman of the Committee
on Foreign Relations, should offer a
resolution directing the President to
appoint a commission to make an in
vestigation of the Santo Domingo debt
and other questions involved in the
protocol. This plan was agreed to ten
tatively as the programme most desir
able under existing conditions, espe
cially as it is believed that such a res
olution could be adopted without de
bate. No decision was reached which
may not be changed to-morrow, and
other plans have been suggested or are
brewing.
Senator Newlands to-day offered a
resolution calling on the President to
forward to the Senate certain informa
tion believed to be in the possession of
the State Department in relation to
Dominican affairs. The resolution was
not seriously considered at this time,
and Newlands' speech advocating adop
tion received scant attention. Later in
the day it was whispered that if the
resolution were adopted and the Demo
crats felt that all of the Information
obtainable would be given to them a
defection of three or four Democratic
votes might result. This would ratify
the treaty. Leaders of the minority
party, on the other hand, took the posi
tion that no information could be forth
coming which would change the princi
ple involved in the treaty, and that it is
idle for the Republicans to hope for aid
from that side of the chamber. The
resolution, nevertheless, remains undis
posed of and there was talk among Re
publican leaders late in the day of
adopting it and putting it to a test as
a vote getter.
It la quite probable the Senate will
adjourn to-morrow or Friday.
ARGUES FOR ANNEXATION.
Senator Heyburn Favors Acquisition
of Santo Domingo.
WASHINGTON, March 15. â Soon
after the Senate went into executive
session to-day Senator Heyburn of
Idaho made an extended argument in
favor of the annexation of Santo Do
mingo.
At the beginning of the last Con
gress Senator Heyburn introduced a
resolution for annexation and sup
ported It at that time in a speech. To
day he declared that the destiny of
this as well as other islands was to
be a part of or under the control of
the United States. He went into the
history of Santo Domingo and cited
previous efforts to acquire the island.
Senator Heyburn favored the pending
treaty because it was in the direction
of annexation.
REPORTS ON SEPARATION
OF CHURCH AND STATE
Committee of the French Chamber of
Deputies Presents Elaborate
Argument.
PARIS, March 15. â The report of
the committee of the Chamber of Dep
uties unon the bill providing for the
separation of church and state was
distributed in the chamber to-day. It
elaborately presents the relations be
tween the church and the Government
since the earliest days and says:
We maintain that the sole solution for the
difficulties growing out of thÂ« regime of the
concordat lg a loyal and complete separation
of church and atate. particularly under the
democracy, wherein the existing universal suf
frage and sovereignty of the people make the
continuation of an official religion such a
defiance of logic and good sense that it seems
astonishing that the French republic continued

.. Charcoal ijÂ» a remedy that the more

drug at ell. but simpiy absorbs the
* eases and impurities always present in
the stomach and intestines and carries
â¢them out of the system.
â¢ ;v- Charcoal sweetens the breath after
smoking. drinking or after eating
onions and other odorous vegetables.
-j %: Charcoal effectually clears and im-

and eminently safe cathartic.
It absorb? the injurious gases which
collect in the stomach and bowels; it
disinfects the mouth and throat from i
the poison of catarrh.
All druggists sell charcoal in one

Is in Stuart's Charcoal Lozenges; they!
are composed of the finest , powdered !

Ashore at Santa Barbara.
SANTA' BARBARA. March 15.â With
a furious southeaster blowing and the
sea running so high that no small boat
could have lived in it for five minutes,
three fishermen were forced to remain
for twenty-four hours on board a small
sloop, buffeted by the waves -and In
momentary danger of being swamped.
Late this afternoon the seas abated
somewhat and three volunteers suc
cessfully lowered a small rowboat and
rescued the fishermen. Captain Blair
and. two seamen named Egrgerty and
Wagner, all of Ban Pedro, were the.
men-* who remained for so many hours
in Imminent danger on board Blair's
twenty-seven-foot j fishing sloop OwL
The party, had been engaged in craw
fish catching off Santa Cruz Island,
but were blown across the channel in
the heavy, storm of Sunday last and
put in to this port Intending to repair
damages and return to the island this
morning. The three men went aboard
Tuesday evening in a shore boat.
This morning a heavy .southeast gale
commenced blowing and in a few min
utes the sea was running dangerously
high. The Owl was In an exposed posi
tion and was not, securely , enough an
chored to ride out the gaJe. Captain
Blair made signals to be taken off, but
although a number volunteered to go
t-.Â« the rescue to launch a boat would
have meant certain destruction. After
successfully riding the gale for a num
bet of hours the Owl was seen to drag
her anchor and drift toward the rocks,
but Just at that time the sea suddenly
calmed with a change of the wind and
a rescue party composed of Captain
Vasquez, Albert Stafford and Frank
.M&glio, all local sailors, made a suc
cessful trip to the sloop and brought
off the men.

pounding upon the beach and is' certain
to be a total los?. . , -. . ... â¢ ..
The vessel was first sighted about
daylight several miles out to sea, and
as she was evidently in distress she
was closely watched by the fishermen
along the shore. Nearer and nearer the
beach she came and finally she struck i
a reef off the head of the Bolsa Slough, i
and went under. Soon thereafter two
dogs came ashore, but if there were \
men upon the vessel they could not be
seen.. The craft went down so that
only a section of her masts were above i
i water. Believing that there had been ;
men upon the schooner, and that they;
had been washed overboard, the beach â 
was patrolled, but up to dark no bodies \
were washed ashore. The 'wrecked yes- ;

Friends of the Wounded Man
Think That He Made the
Dash With Suicidal Intent
VANCOUVER BARRACKS, Wash..
March 15. â Smarting under the sting of
his disgrace and suffering from an in
curable disease, former Lieutenant
Francis M. Boone, who was ordered
discharged from the United States
army on the charges of desertion, ab
sence without leave, non-payment of
debts and conduct unbecoming an of
ficer, to-day made a dash from his
guard, with a deliberate suicidal intent,
it is reported, and before being recap
tured was shot and probably fatally
wounded.
Boone was being conducted from the
guardhouse to the garrison hospital,
when without warning he broke away
and started to run. He was ordered to
halt, but paid no attention to the com
mand, and the guards opened fire. One
bullet out of the five fired at the prison
er took effect in the head, above the
right ear, and passed under the scalp
to a point above the right eye. Another
broke his collar bone.
Boone rose to the office of lieutenant
from the ranks. He is said to belong
to a wealthy New Tork family and has
a wife and child in San Francisco.
He was assigned to this post about
nine months ago. Soon after his ar
rival he left the post without leave,
going to Seattle. On his return from
that city he was placed under arrest
and ordered to remain in quarters. This
he failed to do and disappeared for
three months lacking one day. It is
said that he went to British Columbia
and returned to this country and sur
rendered himself only because he was
ordered by his family In New Tork to
do so or suffer disinheritance. He re
turned, was convicted by court-martial
and yesterday the President approved
the findings of the court. The Presi
dent's order affirming the action of the
court-martial had Just been read to

COAST CITIES
TO BE VISITED
Commissioner Bristow Will
Make an Investigation
Into Shipping Complaints
LOS ANGELES, March 15.â Joseph
L. Bristow, formerly fourth as
sistant Postmaster General, is in the
city, having arrived by way of El Paso
and the Southern Pacific to-day.
Bristow is returning from an official
visit to Panama in his capacity as
special commissioner to the Panama
Railway, in which company the United
States is the chief owner. Uncle Sam
having acquired 98 per cent of the
stock along with other Panama canal
impedimenta,
"The Panama Railway," said Bris
tow to-day, 'has a fifty-mile right of
way across the isthmus from Colon to
Panama, owns many locomotives, pas
senger cars, freight cars, service cars,
steamers, tugs and lighters and has
an authorized stock issued of $7,000,000.
It is, in fact, a commercial enterprise
of no little importance, particularly to
the Pacific coast interests.
"It is the Presidents desire, " con
tinued Bristow, "'to he in possession of
all the facts concerniag the commer
cial side of this acquisition, which iÂ«,
as you know, the first railroad to be
owned outright by the United States.
There are in addition many delicate
questions to be stttled as to policy, re
lations \vfih other lines, with connect
ing steamship companies and as to the
manner of operation. Before commit
ting the Government to any fixed pol
icy, and that no injustice may be done
the shippersâ in short, in order to givt
a square deal to all, it was necessary
to make a study of the situation on
the ground, and for that purpose I
was assigned.
"In addition to examining into con
ditions on the isthmus, my commis
sion extends to the coast cities. The
Government is in receipt of many
complaints from shippers, which,
whether reai or fancied, it is my duty
to investigate. I wish to ascertain the
amount of business originating here
that goes east by the canal, how much
comes this way from the east, and
similar questions having a bearing on
the canal and railway business, all of
great importance to the coast."
Escorted by President Koepfli of t"he
Chamber of Commerce and Chief En
gineer McKinstry of the harbor works,
Bristow will go to-morrow to San Pe
dro to view the Government breakwa
ter and note the progress being made
there. Later in the week he will go to
San Francisco, thence to Portland and
Seattle, returning to Washington about
April 15.

Exciting Scene Takes
Place at Railway
Depot.
Special D!Â»pateh to The Call.
COI^USA. March 15.â Colusa Junc
tion was the scene of an attempted kid
naping: this afternoon, and but for the
Interference of outsiders It might have
proved successful. About two months
ago Edward Brown cam* to Colusa and
brought with him his fthreo- year-old
boy. It. was afterward learned that
Brown had left San Francisco with the
boy just as the Superior Court had de
cided he should give him into the
mother's charge. The mother followed
every possible clew in her endeavor to
locate her lost child, and until Mon
day waa unsuccessful. Then by chance
she learned that the child was with her
husband's relatives in Colusa, She ar
rived here on Tuesday and presented
to the Sheriff papers signed by Superior
Judge Graham of San Francisco giving
her the legal custody of the little one.
The Sheriff accompanied her to the
place where the boy was, and after
borne trouble got possession of him. The
father, who had gone to Spencevtlle.
Yuba County, was notified of what
had occurred, and arrived at Colusa
last nlsht. Instead of attempting to
kldnap^he child here he waited until
the mother had started with it for
Ban Francisco and intercepted them
at Colusa Junction, where he supposed
she would be alone and unprotected.
As soon as Mrs. Brown stepped from
the car Brown rushed up and grabbed
the child from her. At about the same
time Conductor Kamraerer, who had
been asked to be en the lookout for
brown, grabbed the father and kept
him away from the frightened mother
and babe, while a citizen telephoned for
an officer. Brown got Into his buggy
and drove away before the officer ar
rived, swearing he would follow his fnr
mer wife to San Francisco and hav^
the child at all odds.
SUSPECTED RUSSIAN SPIES
SHOWN LITTLE CONSIDERATION
Found Aboard a Steamer Carrying
Pitch to Japan, Captain Puts
Them on an Island.
TACOMA, March 15. â The British
tramp steamship Nairn, now loading
here, carried a cargo of pitch from
England to Japan. While coaling one
night in the Suez canal two Russians
went aboard the steamship as stow
aways and were discovered several
days afterward. The suspicions of
Captain Nailey that the stowaways
might be Russian spies were some
what allayed when it was reported
that the undesired passengers were
Germans willing to work their way
to Japan. Soon afterward a young
German seamen was requested to in
terrogate the men and learn their
plans. He reported they <-ould n"t
speak a word of German. Reaching
the conclusion that they were Russian
spies. Captain Nailey changed the
steamer's course toward one of the
numerous small islands comprising
the Maldive group off the northenst
coast of Africa. The Russians put up
a vigorous protest against being land
ed and followed it by personal re
sistance. They were forcibly bundled
into ;> small boat, however, and pulled
ashore. With a revolver in the hands
of the mate they were compelled to
jump into the shallow water as the
beach was approached and wade
ashore. As the Nairn's cargo was con
signed to the Japanese Government
there was danger that the spies â 
might set it afire.

and submitted evidence to the effect
that Mrs. Edwards had confessed that

vaid a new trial for the condemned ;
woman, and after the Greason case is j
disposed of by the Berks County Court
ht-r application for a commutation of
sentence will be acted upon by the
Board of Pardons. That tribunal has
twice refustd to commute her sentence. I

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY. MARCH 10, 1905.
SHAKESPEARE'S
NAME AN ASSET
It Is Worth Fifty Thousand
Dollars a Year to His Old
Home, Stratford-on-Avon.
XEW FRENCH MAGAZINE
Will Be Eeraodeled on Ainer-
ican Lines and Seek to Oc
cupy Unfilled Field in Paris
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, March IB. â Apropos of
the plan to set up a Shakespeare me
morial in London, it has just been re
vealed what the bard's memory >s
worth in dollars and cents to the town
of Stratford-on-Avon. It seems that
the people from all parts of the world
who visit this literary shrine every
year total 30,000 and leave behind
them a trifle over $50,000. The 'cash
value" of Shakespeare's house last
year, when 26,510 persons visited it
at sixpence each, was 53310; and
$2165 was paid at the museum, $1635
at the memorial, $1310 at Anne HncVi
away'B cottage, and $2875 at Trinity
Church. Thus in fees alone Stratford
receives over $10,000 a year from
Shakespeare pilgrims.
This week the scheme to found a
great Shakespeare house in London
is denounced in letters to the Tinu-s
by such prominent literary men as I.
M. Barrie, Edmund Gosse, Maurice
Hewlett, Lord Lytton and Pinero, who
declare that "such a building as is
proposed, consisting of museum, li
brary and lecture hall, would be su
perfluous and even embarrassins. All
the authentic and interesting relics of
Shakespeare," assert these writers,
â¢are already assembled at Stratford
on-Avon, and any museum which
could be formed in London would be
a rubbish heap of trivialities."
It is true that Stratford has nearly
all the genuine relics of Shakespeare,
but there are some oddly interesting
things carefully preserved in private
collections. Dr. Furnivall has a pair
of buff gauntlets, embroidered in gold,
which were once worn by the poet,
and In the possession of an old Eng
lish family is a carved oak tinder box
which belonged to Anne Hathaway.
In a country house in Warwickshire,
too, there is a small cupboard made
of oak said to be by the same hand
that wrote "King Lear." On it are
the words: "1555, June. I bought it.
I sawed it. May, 1586. I nailed it.
I carved it. Wm. Shakespeare."
Gabriele d'Annunzios next publica
tion will be a collection of his political
articles and speeches. It will be pre
ceded by a preface in which the nov
elist will set forth his ideas on the
functions of Italy in the political
world. A good many of these speeches
by D'Annunzio were delivered dur
ing the short time that he was a mem
ber for Pescara in the Italian Cham
ber of Deputies.
WILDK'S LAST BOOK.
Wherever authors have met in Lon
don hardly anything has been talked
of during the last week but Oscar
Wilde's -De Profundis." The general
feeling seems to be that Wilde's new
found humility was sincere, but that
he was unable to shake off the poseur
in giving it expression. In reviewing
â¢De Profundis" in the Telegraph the
other day. W. L. Courtney asked
whether the book was in any sense
edited and why there was so much
delay in giving it to the world. To
these questions Robert Ross, who re
ceived the manuscript from its au
thor, replies that it was sent from
Reading Jail a couple of months be
fore Wilde's release and that he edit
ed it after it came into his hands. The
complete document consists of 65,000
words. He used his discretion in
withholding certain parts and also
gave the work its title. Ross says it
was his first intention not to issue the
work for several years to come, but
repeated applications from America
and Germany led him to change his
mind.
Regarding Oscar Wilde after his re
lease, there are articles this week in
two of the Paris reviews. One is by
Joseph Renaud, who writes from per
sonal experience and draws a dis
agreeable picture.
"Incapable of writing a line," he
says, "with atrophied brain, Wilde
had only as listeners men who haunt
ed the restaurants and stood him
drinks. There only remained to him
his musical voice and his large, blue,
childish eyes."
Ernest La Jeunesse also describes
"how this piteous wreck asked of the
sea, of Paris, of Naples a new era of
fables and dramas and asked in vain.
Several young writers pressed round
him with their sympathy and encour
agement. He was offered the chance
of a weekly article in a Parisian jour
nal, but refused it; Fernand Xau made
him this offer. Then came the sor
did tragedy nf his death, awful in its
squalor, its loneliness and its ugli
ness."
M RS. GLYX'S LATEST.
"Elinor Glyn," who wrote "The Vis
its of Elizabeth," came up to London
a day or two ago to get copies and
read notices of her latest book, "The
Vi< iesitudes of Evangeline," which is
just being published. As usual she
has supplied her publishers with a
long 1 list of people to whom she wishes
"presentiition copies" sent. A good
many of these folk are titled. Few
English authors possess more intimate
friends in fashionable society than
Mrs. Glyn. She was recently the
guest of James Van Alen at Rushton
Hall, where the American millionaire
sought her advice on many points in
connection with the redecoration of
his new country house, Mrs. Glyn's
taste in such matters being exception
al. For the last few weeks, however,
the author of "Elizabeth" has been at
her home, Sheering Hall, in Essex,
where the work of getting hÂ«Â»r new
book ready for publication has kept
her uncomm,only busy. Mrs. Glyn
says her literary plans are unsettled
and that sbe has no idea when she
will begin on another book.
NEW PARIS PERIODICAL.
For the first time, a magazine con
ducted on American lines is to be
launched in Paris, under the title of
'Me Sals Tout"â "l Know everything."
Hitherto, France has had in the way of
magazine literature only such serious
reviews as the "Revue dcs Deux
Mondes." the "Revue de Paris," the
"Revue, " formerly known as the "Re
vue dcs Revues," appearing monthly or
bi-monthly and having no illustrations;
or else the weekly illustrated papers,
with a serial story running in them,
but depending for the rest of their
text on news articles and photographs.
Of late one or two attempts were made
to get out a species of magazine, but
from lack of funds both material and
illustrations were of mediocre Interest.
The French public was so accustomed
to this state of things that the pub
lishers said nothing better was desired.
Pierre Lafltte, however, who already
edits the most popular woman's paper,
"Femina," the most popular sporting
weekly, "La Vie au Grand Air." and the
most popular musical publication.
DEMOCRAT MAY
WIN THE TOGA
Speaker of the Missouri
Assembly Threatens to
Vote With the Minority
1 ) EA D LOCK CONTINUES
Followers of Hichard Cj
Kerens Cast Their Bal
lots for Dr. Pettijohn
JEFFERSON CITT, Mo., March 15.
The Legislature to-day took two more
ineffectual ballots for United States
Senator. When the roll call on the
second ballot had been completed
Speaker Hill his vote.
"I have been accused," he exclaimed,
"of being a deserter. I want to say j
that as a last expedient and with the ;
consent of the caucus nominee, I voted
for Judge Spencer. I desire to say that
I will be a deserter to the extent of
voting for a Democrat before this As
sembly adjourns without electing a
Senator."
Speaker Hill's announcement was fol
lowed by clamorous cheering, but it
apparently provoked a storm of indig
nation from the Republicans.
The firet ballot resulted: Spencer, 62;
Cockrell, 71; Pettijohn, 16; Bartholdt,
2; Niedringhaus, 2. Necessary to
choice, 77. /
The supporters of R. C. Kerens all
went to Dr. A. C. Pettijohn, who was
. heralded by a brief speech from Sena
tor Mclndoe. prior to casting his bal
lot, in which he said:
"Until the fifth day of January I was
for that silver-haired veteran who has
done more for his party and received
less than any Republican in Missouri
â Richard C. Kerens."
Senator Mclndoe went on to say that
when Niedringhaus was selected as the
caucus nominee for Senator he decided
to support him, but the time had come
when it was apparent he could not be
elected.
The second ballot resulted: Spencer,
64: Cockrell, 71; Pettljahn, 16; Nied
ringhaus, 1.
After the announcement of the sec
ond ballot. Representative Tubbs arose
to a point of personal privilege, and
exclaimed:
"I declare emphatically that I shall
never desert the Republican party.
If Speaker Hill desires to vote for a
Democrat 4. demand here and now that
he resign his office and seat in this
Legislature."
Instantly the Assembly was in an
uproar. There were cheers for Tubbs
by some, and others, climbing on
chairs, loudly called for the sergeant
at-armÃ to restore order.
-ifter pandemonium had reigned for
fifteen minutes. Senator McDavid, Re
publican, made a motion that the joint
session be dissolved. This was met
instantly by a counter-motion for a re
cess until evening. Again there was
tumult, but it was quickly quieted by
.the ordering of the roll-call on Sena
tor McDavid s motion, which was car
ried by a vote of 87 to 62.
FRAZIER TO SUCCEED BATE.
United States Seaatorship for the

The nomination is equivalent to an
election.

ernor by John I. Cox, Speaker of the

Its Work on Ancient Site
CHICAGO,- March 14. â Professor
Robert Francis Harper of the Univer

the expedition now in Assyria, has re
ceived a telegram announcing that the

mya, which was suspended last au

patch was from Victor Persons, en
gineer in charge, and stated that the

The excavation was begun in De

The site of the excavation is be
tween the Timerus and Euphrates
rivers, ninety miles southeast of Bag
dad.
It is a large ruin, second in size
only to Nippur, Warka and possibly
Babylon. The length of the entire

meters to the northwest, is 1665 me
ters and the width 840 meters.

PISTOL SHOTS
REVEAL CRIME
Witnesses Tell of How the
Fire Flashes in the Night
Dispelled the Darkness
SAW DEED COMMITTED
Kiniry Hears How His Friend
Was Found After He Fled
and Left Him to His Fate
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
1016 Broadway, March 15.
There were numerous witnesses ex
amined in the Kiniry murder trial to
day, and the complete story of the
tragedy at Fourteenth and Jackson
streets was set forth. The shooting
was witnessed by a number of persons
who saw the flashes of the pistols, and
by their light distinguished three men
standing close together and heard the
sound of receding footsteps.
Henry Herman, coachman for Dr. P.
L. Wheeler of 1170 Madison street, was
standing not far from the shooting and
the fleeing robbers passed him in the
middle of the street. When nearly op
posite him one of them staggered and
fell, struck by a bullet from the police
man's pistol. His friend came back
and helped him along for a short dis
tance and then by the ray of an elec
tric light he saw one lay the other on
the grass and hurry on. The form he
found lying there proved to be that of
Joe Goldstein, while his compaion was,
by his own admission, the defendant
now being tried for the murder of the
policeman.
Kiniry listens to the details of that
night's tragedy without showing any
emotion.
Dwight Strong was another witness
to the shootlner. As Herman approach
ed the dead robber, from where he was
standing. Strong went toward the place
where the ehots were fired and came
upon the form of the dying policeman.
Mrs. Jennie Stedman and her son, Os
car, with whom Kiniry and Goldstein
roomed for a few weeks while they
were playing the role of students by
day and thieves at night, testified to
the fact of their coming to the house
at 1362 Grove street and engaging their
rooms. Oscar, a youth about*seventeen
years of ape, said that on the day of
which the- murder was committed he
went huntinp with Kiniry and Gold
stein. They returned in the afternoon,
and about 6 o'clock hÂ« saw them leave
the house, leading their wheels. He
went down town shortly afterward
and, hearing of the shooting, went
there and identified Goldstein as one of
the two men who lived at his mother's
house. When he got home he found a
note Kiniry had left, saying that he
would be gone about a week.
Captain W. J. Petersen was called
and detailed the gathering of the evi
dence by him and certain conversations
held between himself apd Kiniry.
Charles and Fred Kute. whose parents
live in the vicinity of the scene of the
shooting and saw the pistol flashes,
told what they had seen on the night
in question.

at $6991. At present the five school
districts are contributing to the ex

horror that the infant had been almost
literally boiled.

FLAMES INJURE
MANY OFFICES
Postoffice Block at Berke
ley Threatened With Com
plete Destruction by Fire
Berkeley Oiflre San Francisco Call.
2118 Center Street. March 15.
Fire and water combined with smoke
ruined the oifices in the upper story of
the Eastman block at Oxford and Cen
ter streets early this morning, caus
ing damage to the building and its con
tents that is estimated at $10,000. The
lower floor of the building, occupied by
the posteffice, Joseph McClains gro
cery, R. A. Berry's real estate office
and the Berkeley office of The Call, was
flooded with water. The postoffice was
but slightly damaged, however, as
Postmaster George C. Sqhmidt came
from his home when the alarm sound
ed, at 3 o'clock this morning, and cov
ered the mail matter with oilcloth and
canvas.
The flre had its origin in electric
wires that became crossed, it is
thought, in the meter-room of the build
ing. Deputy Marshal George Thomp
son discovered the blaze at 3 o'clock,
and all the fire engine companies of
Berkeley responded to the alarm he
gave. For two hours the men under
Chief Kenny fought the flames. They
were greatly hindered by the enormous
quantities of suffocating smoke that eh
veloped the building. The fire was a
"blind"' affair, and before it could be
subdued the roof was chopped open in
a dozen places and through these holes
water was poured until the building
was declared to be out of danger. Fire
man Louis Wescott of the North Berke
ley company was overcome by th-e
smoke while in the building and was
carried out unconscious
Those who suffered the loss of their
otnee furniture and iiersonal effects in
the building are: Dr. Horace N. Hen
derson, Dr. Morris M. Carpenter, Dr.
Allen M. Carpenter, Dr. Joseph T. Far
rar and Dr. Merton J. Congdon. Their
losses will agpregate thousands, as all
had valuable furniture, surgical instru
ments and books that were destroyed.
Dr. J. E. Shafer, a new-comer in the
buildinsr, escaped with nominal loss,
as did also Dr. N. E. Tolles, a woman
hair physician.
Joseph McClain's grocery stock
was damaged to the extent of several
thousand dollars, the water ruining
quantities of his goods. R. A. Berry's
office was flooded, but the damage to
his furniture was nominal, as was that
sustained by the Berkeley office of the
San Francisco Call. The damage to
the building: is estimated at $6000.

Declaring that the moral and esthetic
tone of the university needs uplifting.
Professor Noyes of the English de
partment to-day began the work 1
advising the members of his classes
that hereafter any student who comes
attired in a sweater will be denied ad
mission.
"Sweaters," said the professor, "are
vulgar and unseemly, and no gen
tleman should be found with one on
in the presence of ladles, and particu
larly while in attendance upon univers
ity classes. I wish It distinctly under
stood that hereafter I shall be obliged
to refuse entrance to any pupil who
comes to class wearing one of the ob
noxious garments.
"I regard a sweater, when worn un
der these circumstances, as an insult
to the women students present, and I
believe the women feel very much the
same way about the matter."
Several years ago the practice of
wearing sweaters became so alarm
ingly prevalent at the university that
an order was issued forbidding it, but
there have been lapses from the rule,
and the habit has threatened to again
become general.
Other professors have during the last
few days lectured their classes In
vigorous fashion, regarding their mor
als and student habits in general.
Professor Christy of the engineering
department, a prominent member of
the faculty, to-day lamented the fate
of the proposed "honor system" fea
ture, which the student body voted
down at an election last week. He said
the students by that action publicly
announced that they preferred dis
honesty to honesty.
Professor Lewis of the chemistry
department gave Editor Joseph P.
Loeb a verbal castlgation to-day,
when he said that the editor's remarks
in the Daily Californian, regarding the
big "C" matter, were distinctly flip
pant and calculated to provoke irrev
erence and cast ridicule upon the fac
ulty members who have opposed the
big ".C" project. Loeb had editorially
referred to the storm of protests
against the big "C" as "Much ado
about nothing."

DOUBLE OPERA
BILL PLEASES
AT COLUMBIA
Rita Newman had her triumph
the double bill of the Savage Opera
company at the Columbia last even
ing, both as Santuzza in "Cavaller-.a
Ru3ticana" and as Nedda. in I
liacci." It was a star night in Interest,
for the reason that both the musical
and the dramatic element, the latter
particularly, were In the ascendant.
The inherent Interest in the libretto
lines and situations and the strength
of the music, with its entire adapta
bility to the dramatic exigencies, were
sufficient to hold attention. Curiosity
was on foot to see and hear Newman
in both roles and not less keen to judge
Sheehan in ' I'Pagliacci." It may ba
said with entire frankness that Shee
han was fax better than on some pre
vious nights. His voice played him
few tricks. His dramatic work was so
good that one almost could forget that
this was opera from that point of view.
Newman's great success was neces
sarily in Santuzza, the role giving her
greater opportunities than that of
Nedda. Throughout both shÂ« worked
conscientiously and received the com
pliment of repeated curtain calls.
Santuzza was played intensely. In
deed the entire "Cavalleria Rustica
na," characterized with marked fierce
ness, was made more noteworthy
by the impression that It gave of more
force in reserve.
In "CavaJleria " Kate Sherwood had
the role of Lola. Reginald Roberts
was Turridu. Arthur Deane Alflo, and
May Walters was Lucia. While this
cast combined to give an entirely sat
isfactory and good rendering of th^
opera, the glory justly went to Rita
Newman. Deane was a rough and
ready Alflo, doing a good turn with
the role. Of course the intermezio was
applauded and had to be repeated.
Schenck was at the baton.
While the intermezzo lacked the deli
cacy and extreme varieties of shading
that Mascagni would have given to
it, the personality of Schenck was
strongly in evidence. Of the entire
orchestral work in â 'CavaHeria" about
the same would apply that has been
said about the Intermezzo. The or
chestra was handled vigorously and,
truth to say, the players sometimes
displayed a little too much vigor, nnre
partly drowning out a duet. Or
whole. Bchenck won lanrels. Had that
been his only appearance he sttli would
have been remembered by those of his
auditors who prize the virile quality
first In orchestral playing. To con
tinued applause he was compelled
twice to rise and bow acknowledg
ments.
The heralded singing of the prologue
to "I'Pagliacci " by Winfred Goff was
made good by the actual performance.
So well was it done that the audience
demanded a repetition, and had it. Mr.
Emanuel conducted "IPagliacci" and
made much of the delicacies of the
wood wind and the power of the heav
ier brass wind. The final scene of
"I'Pagllacd" was handled with great
cleverness. The second of the two
tragedies was carried off wtth suffi
cient deliberation to pay some atten
tion to the plausibilities and was a dis
tinct compliment to the intelligence of
an opera audience, which always de
mands more dramatic work than It
really gets when the music put* aside
judgment by its own charms. Of th<=>
chorus, a good word is deserved at
each and every performance of the
Savage company and not least for
what was done last evening.
D # Albert's Second Concert.
Eugen d" Albert's second concert
will be given at the Alhambra this
evening, and a great audience will
doubtless attend. D' Albert proved at
his opening concert on Tuesday even-
Ing that he has no rival as an Inter
preter of Beethoven, and to-night's
concert includes the great sonata in
C minor, op. 111. Thp rest of thÂ»
programme follows: Impromptu, op.
14-. No. 3 (Schubert); three pre
ludes, ballade op. 23 (Chopin); sonata,
fantasia. No. 73 (Schubert); Soiree
de Vienne, op. 6 (Schubert-Lisat) Son
ett di Petrarca (Liszt); valse. op. 18
No. 4 (E. d"Arb-?rt). The D'Albert
matinee on Saturday promises to be
one of the most interesting events of
the musical season, and the pro
gramme, which will be announced
later, will be an astonishingly lnteiâ*
ing one.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL. THURSDAY, MARCH IG. 1905.
FREED THROUGH
TECHNICALITY
R. A. Crothers and Fremont
Older Purged of Contempt
of Court by Judge Cook
FINE POINT IS DRAWN
Should Have Instituted
Proceedings Before Jurist
on Different Legal Lines
In a lengthy decision that took
over an hour in delivery, Judge Cook
yesterday dismissed the contempt pro
ceedings ag-ainst R. A. Crothers and
Fremont Older of the Bulletin ,m a
technicality.
The principal point raised by the
respondents was that no proceedings
had been brought against them he
fore Judge Cook as a judicial officer,
but were pending in the Superior
Court for the city and county of San
Francisco. The alleged contempt con
sisted of comments on the cases of the
women arrested at 62 (J Jackson street,
who had made applications for <vrits
of habeas corpus before Judge Cook,
and the prisoners were ordered to be
brought before the Judge. It was con
tended that if any contempt had been
committed it was punishable by Judge
Cook as a judicial officer and the pro
ceedings should have been brought
before him as such judicial officer and
not before the Superior Court .is a
court.
POINT PURELY TECHNICAL.
On this point the Judge said; "If
these contempt proceedings had been
initiated before me, as such a judi
cial officer, I would have no hesitation
in adjudging the respondents guilty of
a contempt of myself as such officer,
provided, as such officer, I had the
same jurisdiction to hear and deter
mine the matter that I would have
had had a writ been issued by a Jus
tice of ihe Supreme Court and made
returnable before me as :i Judge.
They were not, however, so initiated;
on the contrary, they were initiated
nna arc pending in the Superior Court
and the affidavit charges a contempt
of that court, and that the habeas cor
pus proceedings were, at the time of
the alleged publication, pending in the
Superior Court. Consequently the evi
dence introduced, showing as it does
such proceedings should have been
pending before me, acting as a Judge,
wholly independent of the Superior
Court, fails wholly to sustain the al
legations of the affidavit on which the
Superior Court issued the warrants of
attachment herein, and for the rea
sons stated it is clear that such at
tachments must be dismissed. Not
because the respondents are not guilty
of a contempt of court, but solely be
cause such contemirt wag not a con
tempt of the Superior Court in which
these proceedings are pending, but
was a contempt either of myself as
a judicial officer or of a court created
by the habeas corpus act and com
posed of a Judge only â without clerk,
bailiff or other officers^ â and before
which court or Judge no proceedings
for contempt have been instituted.
"Unquestionably the point made by
respondents' counsel for the avoid
ance of the consequences of such a
publication as that set forth in the af
fidavit filed herein is purely technical
and if these warrants of attachment
are dismissed such dismissal will be
on account of a technicality, pure and
simple, but these respondents equally
with any one else charged with mis
conduct are entitled to the benefit of
such technicalities as are by law
deemed sufficient to stay its power.
Technicalities are not recognized by
the law that the guilty may escape,
but that none who are innocent may
by any possibility suffer."
REFERS TO PERSONAL ATTACK.
On the other two points raised by
the respondents the Judge hold
against them. He held that section
170 of the Code of Civil Procedure
has no application to proceedings in
contempt and if it had application
both affidavits filed in the proceedings
should be considered; also that those
affidavits being considered that the
objections made to the qualifications
of himself to hear the proceedings
should be overruled.
Speaking of the editorial boaring
the heading, "The Judge of Lajt Re
sort," the Judge said: "So far as the
personal attack and libel on myself
are concerned, they can have no con
sideration in contempt proceedings
and as stated by me in the affidavit fllt-d
in response to respondents' motioa for
a transfer of the matter, they are not
worthy of notice for the reason thai,
they are without foundation and were
evidenly written by some one laborinx
under false impressions. Recorl evi
dence is always superior to the unsup
ported assertions of any one, and I
have ever found it to be a truism that
an unjust attack hurts no one. for
truth is mighty and must prevail and
in the end he who is right will be tri
umphant."
The Welsh Naturally Religious.
The Cymrodorion Society of Califor
nia held its monthly meeting on Tues
day night and was addressed by the
Rev. S. Slocombe, who said that the
Welsh are naturally a religious peo
ple. In Druidical times, he said, the
Gauls received their religious instruc
tions from the sacred groves of Great
Britain. The facility with which the
Welsh received Christianity in the first
century and the ardor of the Welsh
Crusadere were among the interesting
subjects lllustrated.^Mr. Slocombe said
that it had been shown that the Ref
ormation, also the movement in which
Wesleyan Methodism originated, and
every similar "awakening during the
last 800 or 1000 years," either began
or was preceded by a similar move
ment in Wales. Incidentally, the
speaker referred to the spontaneous
character of the present great Welsh
revival.

RAGAN REPLIES
TO CRITICISM
Health Officer Denies the
Charge That Inspection
of Food Has Been Dropped
3IETHODS AEE IMPROVED
Says Former Plan Was Used
to Make Soft Places for
Old Political Hangers-On
Health Officer Ra^an yesterday is
sued a statement denying the charge
made by the Supervisors' Health Com
mittee that food inspection has been
virtually abandoned. The statement
follows:
The report of the Health Commute* of the
Board of Supervisors alleging: that the Health
Board has virtually abandoned the inspection
of food is most unfortunate by reason of the
fact that It Is untrue, because of Its being
an incomolete rei>ort for the purpose of com
parison. Food inspection In December, 1904,
differed from the food Inspected In December,
IMS, In the kind of food Inspected. In the
loimer period inspection and condemnation
consisted of a visit to mercantile places and
reporting to the Health Department the food
products actually set aside by the shop-keep
er as unfit for sale. In the latter period sam
ples of food products were gathered from
ihesf places and analyzed In our laboratory.
The former method of Inspection certainly ad
mits of tabulation. The second does not. For
instance: A sample of canned goods of a par
ticular brand is brought \o the laboratory
under the present syalem and if found adul
terated that particular brand Is condemned.
How then can we make an accurate estimate
of the actual number of cans of that particu
lar brand of goods that Is for sale in this
maxket and that have been placed under the
ban of condemnation?
The -work of lnsiiection in our laboratories
then must be add?d to the work of market
Inspection in order to arrive at a Just esti
mate to the comparative work. The publio
certainly has not forgotten the vast amount
of work done in milk and cream inspection In
our laboratories. This Is real food inspection.
Compare for instance tbe laboratory examina
tion of these foods for the month of Decem
ber, 19<M, as against those of the correspond
ing month of 1903. We find In the former
565 inspections as against 21 similar inspec
tion for the month of December, 1903. Now
add to this the figures submitted by the chair
man of the Health Committee of the Board
of Supervisors and you will find the advan
tajre in favor of the present system.
The food Inspection of 1903 was sanitary
inspection and not food Inspection. No city
of the Union tolerates the method which this
Board discarded. All food inspection is un
der charge of the laboratories and the pres-,
ent Board of Health elmply marched In the
line of progress and took position well In ad
vance of this line. The former method of
rj inspection did not conserve the interests
the public health and was of no statistical
nor scientific benefit. The present method haa
attracted the attention of our university people
and all the chemical laboratories engaged in
similar work. The former method was to
make places for political hangers-on. "The.
present method admits of no political inter
ference, as the men have been recommended
by the heads of the departments of two uni
versities.
DISPUTE MAY
BEACH COURT
Real Estate Men Assert Mrs.
Simpson Signed Deed to
the Sale of Her Property
The dispute over the sale of the'prop
erty owned by Mrs. Sarah Simpson at
125 Ellert street is still unsettled and it
is very likely the case will soon come
before the courts. McKay & Zimmer
man, the real estate agents who were
about to close the sale of the property,
state positively Mrs. Simpson signed
the deed. Albert Fuhrmann, Mrs.
Simpson's attorney, did not swear out
warrants for the arrest of the real es
tate men yesterday, so no action was
taken.
John T. Walter, the man who was to
purchase the property and who paid
$149 80 to Mrs. Simpson to be used for
the release of the mortgage, wants to
have some action taken at once. Yes
terday, in the presence of Zimmerman,
McKay and Fuhrmann, he offered Mrs.
Simpson $610 20 for the property and
wanted her to sign it over to him. Mrs.
Simpson refused the offer, demanding
that Walter pay her $750 20.
This the latter refused to do, stating
that he had made a bargain with the
real estate men and that he intended to
live up to it. It was announced yes
terday that Attorney William Kenyon,
representing Walter and the real estate
men, would file an attachment to-day
to recover the $149 80 which Walter
had already paid over to Mrs. Simpson
when he agreed to buy the property a
few days ago.
The real estate men contend they are
in the right and say positively Mrs.
Simpson signed the contract and that
it was duly recorded. Zimmerman
says Frank Simpson, son of the owner,
called on the firm last December and
agreed to sell the house and lot for
$800, agreeing to pay the agents 6 per
cent commission and allow them to
keep any sum over $800 which the prop
erty might bring.
Walter was secured as a purchaser
for the property and the real estate
men say they went to Mrs. Simpson on
February 20 and asked her to sign a
deed of sale for the house and lot. She
refused at first, but later they say she
consented in the presence of them
selves and her son Frank. Walter
turned over to Mrs. Simpson the sum
of $149 80 for the release of the prop
erty by the Fair heirs, the original
owners, and he supposed he was about
to come into possession of the house
and lot.
Four Weighers Discharsced.
After April 15 the offices of four
assistant weighers in the Custom
house will be abolished in accordance
with the recommendation of the spe
cial treasury agents. By the date men
tioned the new customs platform
scales will have been installed on the
v.ater front, thus reducing the num
ber of men required for the work.
Customs Collector Stratton has se
lected the following named as the vic
tims: E. B. Sweeney, $1200 per an
num; Gaston L. Hahn, $4 per diem,
when employed; Michael Moran, $1200
per annum, and William J. Delaney,
$1100 per annum.
Brooks Cross-Examined.
John S. Partridge, Assistant City At
torney, resumed yesterday afternoon
before United States Commissioner
Heacock the cross-examination of
William Brooks, auditor and land
agent of the Spring Valley Water Com
pany. The value of the realty owned
by the company was the subject of the
discussion.

the Judge may appoint a referee, who must
be an attorney, to take evidence and present '
his findings of fact and conclusions of law .
to the Judge, on which report the determlna- ;
tion of the court shall be made. What a
preposterous proposition! The function of the ',

whom the court may see fit to appoint, and
if the attorney reports that the assessment Is
excessive or out of proportion to any othÂ«r ;
assessment the Assessor must pay all costs, j

would be opened up!
This bill would ignore the present system |
and court decisions and constitute any Superior
Judge an Assessor. It further compels the
Assessor, at his own expense, should his as
sessment be modified, to defray the costs of
the action. If his assessment is maintained
the protesting taxpayer or corporation must |
defray the experts*. Such a law would maXs
Assessors exceedingly timorous in establishing
values on any corporation's property which
would involve the Assessor in litigation and
consequent expense to him. It seems Incred- '
ible that such a bill could have passed both
houses of the Legislature without attracting
the attention of the press or the taxpayers.
Who believes for a moment that any corpora
tion that now claims to be excessively as
sessed would not welcome such a law, which
provides a review of their assessment by an
official having no knowledge of matters of
assessment or no knowledge of the principals
which have determined the assessments of ;
similar property?
Thirteen Assessors ar* created in this cit>
where one now performs the duties. If any
one of the thirteen could 1 be reached how long
would it take tax-shirking corporations to
locate him?
MORRIS LEVY RETIRES
FROM HIS POSITION
Secretary of Board of Works Is
Granted a Six Months' Leave
of Absence.
Morris Levy, secretary of the Board
of Works, yesterday filed an applica
tion with the board for a six months'
leave of absence dating from April 1,
1905. The board granted the appllca- '
tion. This action is in accordance
with Levy's announced Intention made
last January that he would sever his
connection with the Department of
Works. When the six months have
expired Levy will probably get an ex
tension of his leave, as he desires to
devote his entire time to his pugilistic
interests. Although several names
have been mentioned as Levy's prob
able successor the board took no ac
tion relative to the appointment to the
vacancy.
A committee from the Potrero Im
provement Club appeared before the
board and complained of the danger- ;
ous condition of the Nineteenth-street
bridge and of the delay in building
the structure. The board directed that
notice be sent to the Santa Fe Rail
way to hasten the construction of the
bridge.
The board granted a permit to J.
G. Harney to bituminize California
street between Third and Fourth ave
nues despite the opposition of J. W. '
McDonald, a rival contractor. Har
ney said he filed his petition contain
ing the signatures of a majority of the
owners before McDonald filed his ap
plication. McDonald said he would
do the work for the property owners
who had not signed Harney's petition,
even if he had to charge 5 cents a
square foot.
The board ordered the construction
of a culvert to drain Army street near
Kentucky at a cost of $450.
Requisition was made on the Civil
Service Commission for certification
of Miss May E. Sullivan to be appoint
ed as a stenographer at $75 per
month.
OPPOSES LIMITING THE
SPEED OF STREET CARS
Attorney of United Railways Says Re
strictive Ordinance Would Retard
City's Development.
The Supervisors' Street Committee
yesterday resumed consideration of
the advisability of recommending an
ordinance limiting the rate of speed
at which street cars shall be run
within the city limits.
Attorney Tirey L. Ford said it '
would be unwise from the standpoint
of municipal development to place ;
any restriction on the speed of cars.
Ford said the Interests of the United
Railroads and the public are identi
cal, and the modern tendency is to ,
have rapid transportation to develop j
outlying districts. He said:
No company will run Its cars at such a
speed as to endanger life. In Minneapolis the
law reads that cars shall not be run at a
speed of less than eight miles and In ticm
Angeles there la no restriction. If you hayÂ»
â¢ rigid law you ar* going to deprive the
city of the beat possible service.
Ford presented a copy of a letter
from E. P. E. Troy, which contains
information that Troy has been asked
to frame an ordinance limiting speed '
and that he has sent letters to the
Mayors of 100 cities to obtain data
on the subject. The committee dis
claimed that it had given Troy any
authority to proceed in the matter. '
Ford then agreed to submit an ordi
nance containing the rules and regu
lations of the company at present in
force regarding the speed of its can, ,
and the matter went over for four :
weeks.
The Point Lobos Improvement Club :
petitioned that Clement street, from ;
Second to Sixth avenues, be placed in
proper condition.
The resolution directing the Board
of Works to notify the owners of .
I property obstructing streets removed
to the corporation yard to redeem the
same or else it will be sold at auction
was referred to the City Attorney.

PUBLIC UTILITIES.
AFTER several years of agitation the people of Oakland have j
voted on municipal ownership of public utilities. The vote j
was upon the iseuÂ« of nearly $6,000,000 in bonds, based on
the city's credit, for the acquisition and installment of a municipal
er plant. A minor feature in the plan was the leaving in the
field of the existing water plant, in corporate ownership, as a coni
or of the proposed municipal plant. We say this was a minor;
ire. for the reason that a larger question seems to have in
fluenced the voters.
Aside from this and with the larger question settled, the com- ,
:Â»etitive plant rises to first importance. The voters were obviously 1
â¢enced by an indisposition to incumber the city's credit and
impair it* bonding power by an issue which mortgaged the public!
revenues in a somewhat doubtful experiment in public ownership.
fbr this reason that the bonds failed to get even a majority
an<' lacked over 6000 votes of the necessary two-thirds. We are
well assured that the vote would have been for the bonds if they 1
had been based upon the proposed plant alone, leaving the public
If! free and unincumbered.
The troubled experience in Europe and this country in bonding
icipalities for public utilities has inclined the more intelligent
>cateÂ« of that system toward the policy of making the public
plant carry the cost of its creation and administration, to be paui
->. who use it. Cities in Great Britain which have followed
â¢ of incumbering the public credit for such purposes have had
- me a colossal burden of taxation for municipal plants. The
Briti-h Local Government Board reports that in the cities that have
:>ted municipal ownership the total public debt in 1875 was only
;. 000.000. or $20 per head of population. Now in the same cities
the public debt is 5i. 650.000 .000. or $50 per head of population.
Commenting upon this condition of municipal finance the Lon- .
Times said : "The time has come for the British people to say '
whether or not they concur in the transfer, not only of great, specu
lative, and often even experimental industries, but of all sorts of
minor trades as well, to municipal control : whether or not it is de
sirable that our towns and cities should be changed into essentially
socialistic communities, where trade, industry and local government
will all be conducted on socialistic lines : whether or not the incur
ring of stupendous financial liabilities, the rapid accumulation of
local debts and the increase to an almost unbearable extent of local
â¢axation are consistent with the best interests not only of the town<
and localities concerned, but of the nation at large ; and whether,
rating that all these things are right and desirable, the status
'â rning bodies i> being maintained at so high a point*
that one may feel perfect confidence in their efficiency alike for
dealing with questions of public health and ordinary local govern
ment, for the conduct of so many great and varied industries and en
terprises, and for the wi^e and effective control of a huge municipal
btedness so that it shall not become a menace to the welfare of
the country."
In this country the question is in the green stick. .In Great
Rrit<-*in it i:- mi the dry. There the carnival of municipal ownership
tilities, started by Mr. Joseph Chamberlain when he was
the Mayor of Birmingham, has passed through the stages of en
thusiasm and hope, and the cheerless and frigid day of accounting
has arrived. The responsibility assumed and the incumbrance of the
rmb'ic credit are so stupendous and appalling that the wisest ad
vocates of municipal ownership are compelled to cast about for a
lie and sober method. Led by men of high intelligence, they
are now resorting to the every-tub-on-its-own-bottom policy, which
reqrures that the public credit be no further impaired and that each
public plant carry its own credit and cost, to be paid by the users,
and not by the taxpayers.
To these philosophers the people of ( )akland have given a votÂ«*
onfiderue. and to this better plan have given their approval. We
are persuaded that they have acted wisely. Let their action be fo!
ed up by a movement to secure the necessary legal right to issue
the plan to be acquired, to be paid by the ratepayers
who use it. For water in public buildings, for fire purposes, to irri
gate parks and to sprinkle the streets, objects that concern all. the
will be a patron of its own works, and the cost should be paid
by all the people. There is no sorcery required to find the cost of
the water that is used for those purposes, and all the people should
pay it. Othrr\yi* c the post of the plant and its administration should
be paid by the private consumers whom it serves.
We have pointed out. heretofore, the two indorsements of this
proper policy by the people of the State, in the case of the ferry
depot and the new seawall. Neither of those projects would have
been indorsed had the debt for that purpose been put upon the tax- i
payers to pay. It was properly put upon the users of the utilities it
created, and i<- being paid and will be paid by them alone, and the
public credit is not incr.mbered nor impaired. The ferry building
and the -eawall are in public ownership and administration, without
cost to the public except such part of it as uses them. Before the
public could have acquired those public utilities in that proper way,
they had to have the authority of law for acquisition by that method,
was given and the plants were acquired. Before a city can in
like mannp r acquire public utilities it must have thp authority of law,
the way to get it iÂ« to ask for it.
The people of < >akland have rejected acquisition by mortgaging
tfcfetr property and increasing their taxes, and have negatively, at
least, indorsed the position of The (Jail for acquiring public utilities
that chaii carry their own credit and co=t. without burden to the
\ local paper in that city say? that it overestimated their
eiligence when it aÂ«ked them to burden their public credit, impair
tiding power and increase their taxes. We think different 'v
Â«>f the people of Oakland. We think that the local paper under
mated their intelligence when it asked them to adopt such a dis- .
astrous policy. _______ _______
CALIFORNIA WHEAT.
*Tp HE Legislatnre, responding to the movement initiated by the
State Board of Trade, appropriated $10,000 to meet the expenses
of the Cereal Improvement Commission, which the board
ttfcrtod Ii ;c a statistical fact, startling to every California wheat
grower, that in order to giv? our flour an export value we are com
pelled to import annually 72.000 tons of gluten wheat to make up
for the lack of that elerrDrnt in our own grain.
Our experience is not novel. Australian wheat suffered the
me ioÂ«c of ghiten and did not recover until an American cereal ex
rt \vaÂ« employed by the colonies to discover a remedy. He hap
l a mechanical genius as well as an expert in cereals, and
u p reglutenized Australian wheat he proceeded to introduce
1 Mew South Wales the system of handling grain in elevators and
( xporting it in bulk, as it i* practiced in our Eastern wheat States.
This saved to the Australian wheat raisers the annual cost of sacks,
snd greatly economized the handling and shipping of grain. At
pr^c^nt we. under the bondage of custom, buy sacks every year, han
â¢ Th*> grain into a warehouse, handle it out again into carÂ«. handle it
hi cars into another warehouse and out again for stowage into
' ships. By the elevator system there is only one handling, which is
from the field into the elevator. After that the process is mechanical
entirely, and the farmer takes his sacks home to be stored for use
another year.
The American expert in Australia changed all this, and the
same change is quite possible here. The Legislature did well in
ally equipping the inquiry into the condition and improvement
of om wheat crop, and upon that inquiry may impinge improve
ments and economies in handling that will add to the savings and
therefore to the profits of the California wheat grower.
Trouble is breaking out in bo many places that the map of Russia, will

HER PENNY'S WORTH
. . TT PENNY for your thoughts,"
* j_\ said Miriam.
| "It's not an original re
mark." said Howard Crelgh
ton, "but I'll rake you up."
"It may not be original," she re
torted, bridling, "but it's better than
fitting like an owl, as you hare been
these last ten minutes."
"Give me the penny."
"Not until you have delivered the
goods," she said laughingly.
"Well, to begin. I was thinking
how much I loved you."
"You don't expect a penny for an
ol<l story like that, do you?" she asked
mockingly.
"It depends upon the value you
place upon true love."
'"I thought it was the other sort
that was valued in dollars and cents.
Look at Lettie Conover."
"Miss Conover," he explained, "iÂ»
not purchasing love with her marriage
settlements. Her father is paying for
the privilege of calling his grandchil
dren by a title." \
"Don't you f hink you haVe absorbed
a let of Socialism?"
"I am not a Socialist," he defended.
' 1 simply detest this modern device
of seeking to bolster up a good Amer
ican name wkh nothing worse than
hog lard upon it, with the uncleanly
pedigree of the sort of lordling who
will marry for money, clearly realiz
ing that it is the title â not the man
which is wanted."
She gravely passed him a coin.
"The original thoughts were not
worth the price. This is."
He motioned her hand away. "It
vould be a poor missionary who
would sell his gospel," he declared.
"Do you suggest that I am in need
of being saved?'" she demanded, color
ing.
'"I hope not," was his quiet answer.
"1 think you're just horrid. I never
gave Lord Carnavon any encourage
ment to follow me home."
Creighton shrugged his shoulders
ever so lightly.
"If you think that I even permitted
him to imagine "
"He has no imagination. Only an
instingt."
WHY A COURTED GIRL IS COY
Her Conduct Not A. ways Intelligible to Herself-â She Does Things
"Just Because."
THE perplexed suitor ho writes |
to ask me why a girl acts more
friendly with young men for
whom she does not care than
with the one whom she likes best had
better read for -. encouragement that
poem of Lowell's called "The Courtln',"
from which I quote the following
stanza: . . * "
To say why gals do so or so.
Or. don't. ""'ould be presuming. :
Mehby to mean "yen" and say 'no'
Come* n&teral to women.- '-
' But one really does not need to go
either to poetry or philosophy for an
answer to the riddle. You do as well
to consult your common sense. Is it
not man's place to woo? Reluctance
to be' won is maidenhood's role, and is
part of the mystic attraction ' of its
charm. Why does coquetry flee, except
to excite pursuit? Why does it resist
if not to provoke conquest?
If Mrs. Browning is right about it, a
girl's coyness is based on womanly
modesty, and often what seems in. her
manner cruelty toward adoring man is
nothing but prudence.
A : girl hesitates to commit herself as
to the state of her affections until she
is sure both of her lover's undying de
votion and also of her own complete
responsiveness, for "to him the least
thing given means great things at a dis- |
tance." The love whjk-h she is used to j
in her home relations is a love which is
given freely without thought of any re
turn. . But the new- love has a different j
nature ; it asks . so'- much, and unless it
is willing to give as much as it asks a
girl cannot afford to \ place her self-re
spect- in forfeit. x .
If, - therefore, a man has not asked
the girl : whom he loves \to marry:* him

other, mean to do so, he has no right

"It would be a poor missionary

declared.
"Howard Creighton," she stormed,
'I want you to understand that Lord

not permit my friends to be spoken
of in that fashion."
"Then he is a friend."
"Nothing more," she declared hast
ily.
"And very little of that," he finished.
"It's your money he wants."
"How do you know?"
"I happened to know he explained
to your father that he could not marry

"How did you happen'?" she asked
with cutting sarcasm.

PREPARED FOR IT.
Lady â Ain't you ashamed tÂ© be
begging?
Tramp â No, ma'am. You see, I
was eddicated for the ministry.
"Very tactful of father, to take the
schedule to you, just because you hap
pen to be his legal adviser."
"Quite natural." he admitted. "You
see, unlike Carnavon, I do not adver
tise my love."
"Do you Insinuate that he has been
making me conspicuous by his atten
tion?"
"Well," said Creighton mildly, "hs
only needs a license and a leader to
complete the suggestion of dog-like de
votion."
She rose and turned upon him. "I
would have you understand," she said
fiercely, "since father has admitted you
into his confidence, that I am going to
marry Lord Carnavon."
"I hope not," he said sincerely.
"Apart from all personal feelings, I
should hate to see you throw yourself
away upon a man who sees in you
only a means of satisfying his credit
ors."
"You know better than that."
"I know more than that," he cor
rected. "I've loved you, Miriam, ever
since you were a child. When I was
working my way through college and
law school and your father was still
fighting for the fortune he since has
gained you loved me. You love me
still."
Her lips trembled a little, but she
made no sound. She turned away to
the window and cooled her flushed
face against the icy pane.
"I shall be rich, too, some day.
Meanwhile. I do not demand that my
wife shall pay my debts. I want only
you."
"I am engaged to another." She
scarcely spoke above a whisper.
"But you do not love him and you do
love me. Won't you send him upon
his way, dearest?"
He did not see that she was crying
and he urged the question again. This
time there was only the mute surren
der to his caress, but it was enough to
assure him that the decision of revolu
tionary days had been repeated, and
there was another British defeat.
Carnavon was rather glad. He had
just gained the favor of a young wom

who had several millions in her own

her to account if she really treats him
badly. But he may find, as a conse
quence, that his dream castles have
tumbled into the dungeons of despair
which are sometimes underneath such
edifices, especially If he is unreason
ably jealous and she is a girl of spirit.
So. if in his secret heart he is sure of
her love, he had better read the riot
act to his tumultuous feeling?, buy
her a box of candy, take her to the
theater and tell her that she is the
prettiest girl in the world and that
he loves her as no man ever loved
woman before.
A girl's conduct is not always intel
ligible to herself. She does any num
ber of things "just because." Her
moods are as unreliable as those of a
breeze in springtime. If she were
otherwise she would not be the witch
tbat she is, but. instead, either an old
woman or a good fellow â that is to
say. a most unsatisfactory kind of a
sweetheart.

It is in the matter of 'landlord's fix

are provided by the landlord and are
part of the attractions of the flat as a

renting a flat without window panes as
one in which he was expected to pro
vide his own apparatus for lighting.
And, in addition, there would In a New

SALLY SHARP
Easily the most picturesque church
wedding of the late winter was cele
braud last night in the gray stone
church of the Unitarians, when Miss
Florence Bailey, daughter of Mr. and
Mrs. J. D. Bailey, became the bride of
William Frederick Mohr, the dashing
New York clubman, he who journeyed
across Use continent twice to woo, and
now to wed.
The caajioel of the church had been
graced with palms, ferns and masses
ot white roses and Bermuda lilies,
tweet with the perfume of spring.
Threading through these were trailing
vines, their sinuous lengths binding
I*a.im to palm.
Karly the invited guests began to
arrive, and pending the approach of the
bridal party were entertained by organ
overture*. Promptly at 8:30 the joyous
burst of Lohengrin proclaiming the tid
injjs Hiobe, and then was there much
I'uiite craning of necks.
Following the ushersâ Roy Pike, Jack
Haird, Herbert and Milton Bailey,
Louis Slos,s and Morton Smith of New
York â came Miss Grace Spreckels, the
ir.aid ot honor, wearing a fluffy white
Bown of silk and chiffon and bearing
a shower bouquet of bride roses and
Viailing fern.
jVexi appeared the six bridesmaids â
ii stunning group of smart set maidsâ
Mies Helen lie Young and Miss Bessie
Wflson in pink chiffon frocks. Miss
Constance de Young and Miss Freda
Mehr in pale primrose, and Hiss Edith
Simpson and Miss Lucie King in palest
Â£ieeji, all carrying shower bouquets of
roses.
Then came the bride, leaning upon
the arm of her father. Statuesque and
beautifuL she wore a robe of heavy
ivory satin, cut upon simple lines, with
touches of rare old lace. Falling about
her was â  mist of tulle, the traditional
token of bridehood â and famously
fetching to her fair face.
At the chancel the bridal party was
met by Mr. Mohr, his best man, Wilson
Marshall, and the Rev. Dr. George W.
Stone. In a voice that reached the
iiirthermost ends of the church. Dr.
Stone read the ceremony and pro-
Ruonced the benediction, during which
the organ murmured a tender obbli
gato.
The ceremony over, the bride left the
church on the arm of her husband
Hire, manly looking chap and passed
quickly to Uieir carriage, the bridal
party and invited guests following to
the home of the bride on Franklin
Here a reception was held and
many a toast to the fair bride went
around the boards â and to the Gotham -
ite who won her.
After a brief post-nuptial trip, Mr.
and Mrs. Mohr will proceed to New
York, where they will make their per
manent home. However, since Mr.
Mohr considers a cross-continent trip
jnuch as many of us Regard a voyage
to Oakland, there is little doubt that
Fan Francisco will often see the

FINAL RULING
IS ANNOUNCED
Ca 1i f ( >rn i i Comnii ssioners
to Portland Exposition
Publish Notice of Plan
. Thg California commissioners to the
Portland Exposition have issued what
might be called an ultimatum' in set
tlement of all controversies that have
existed concerning the plans for the
installation of California exhibits at
the coming- big show in Oregon.
This is in the shape of a letter that
Is addressed to all Chambers of Com
merce and Boards of Trade and par
ticularly to central organizations in
California. In the first " paragraph of "
this communication it is set forth that
after thoroughly considering the situa
tion in all its phases the commission
ers have concluded that 'it is imprac
ticable to provide for separate county
or district, collective installations in
the California building.' ;
There has been no lack of assist
ance on the part of the Sacramento
and San Joaquin valleys, particularly,
in giving the commissioners -food for
consideration." Delegates from both
of the great interior valleys have visit
ed the commissioners â in this city : and
the commissioners for Alameda, County
hay* also made known their wishes.
- The Sacramento Valley people went
to far as to correspond with the. au
thorities -of the Portland Exposition
and to ask whether ; they could have
ppace for a building for the ..Sacra
mento Valley display. The Alameda
County commissioners have also talked
cf a building. - ; / .; ' ;â â â .
In their ; communication the 'Cali
fornia commissioners say in part: ; â ;â ;-â 'â 
Knowing, however, the desire that exist* in
most sections of the Stats for distinctive rec
ognition, and believing that It is an advantage
to Â«how the wide area of California % that it
capable of successfully producing ' the â  State's
characteristic ' products,' - we - : have concluded
, thst an Installation can be arranged which, at j
least In the main features, will give the dif
ferent sections of the State distinctive recogni
tion. - . : â  â -.-;â â -â  ," â¢â¢.â "';-.';â .-:. yi â ;â â â â -- â  :
We have in mind particularly : in the space i
under the dome In the center of the building,
about fifty by fifty feet, the installation of. a
' pyramid â  constructed with, as many â  sides as ;
there are main divisions i of â * the State â¢ that
1 participate.- On each side of Its pyramid the i
respective . divisions can t show, i for instance, !
their processed fruits and vegetables, adorned !
and : trimmed ; with other products, installed '.
undÂ«r one general uniform rule, but in such a !
way as to give distinction at a glance to i
the. part of the State represented thereon. "-.â¢'â¢*â¢- -i
'As ! processed' fruits are always '. the leading
feature in *a' California . exhibit, for , the reason
that thry are better in quality,"' greater in va
riety and more I perfectly Â» processed than such
products ; from, other States and -countries' we
suggest â  that on "this structure these , products
h<- made; the < leading feature, and that enough
for ; the : purpose from each locality be selected
1 from the -best- of that which was returned from
I St. - Louis. In front of each 'of â  the : respective
I sides of this pyramid,* distinctive features of
th* , locality represented, can ybe o Installed 'in
j sucha'way as tn bring within close proximity
; the most important articles ' from the respective
I stctlons of the; State. ,;. v .-.'^/-â¢ > r~> Â»;â¢"."â."â â '
3 .Under, thin 'arrangement each principal sub-
I division of California can have | substantially a
t separate exhibit, embodying ' ; at least * enough
| cf Its products to j male* It < characteristic. : The I
i same general idea can be carried out through
| cut - the entire - exhibit; that -, is 1 wherever t there
Is a display of any one leading, California' prod-
I uct, the â¢ portion thereof ; from =:' any : particular
i part ' of . the State I can ibe Installed jin ! such J a
i way as to make a feature by itself, , with label*
| and signs ;to â > Indicate â¢>; the -t producer : and . the
locality- In! which; it Is â  produced. â . â 'â¢; â %â %-â  -â -â â 'â 
In thin arrangement , we ; figure ' at . most f five
I subdivisions 'of - California, namely: v. Sacra.
I mento Valley; and tributary I counties,' San Joa-
I quin Valley v and i tributary : counties, the :-. bay
counties â ' the - coast ; counties, and Â» the ' counties :
south of It is Important for us to
know as ' early as â¢ possible how many lof these
subdivision* ! desire teuch distinction in the in
stallation as wo have indicated. .-. ~ .-â o ~ ~, â ;,

FAIR CONTEST
IS RECALLED
W. W. Foote Estate Sued on
Contract Based on Agree
ment With Mrs. Craven
SMALL SUM IS INVOLVED
Though Judgment for but
$1050 Is Asked, Interesting
Fact? Tnderlie the Action
Time has not yet dispelled the mem
ory of the broken hopeÃ, to say noth
ing of the broken contracts, that cen
tered in the battle Mrs. Nettie R. Cra
ven waged for years against the ea>
tate of the late James G. Fair. An
other suit that will necessitate the tell
ing of some as yet untold details of
that celebrated legal contest was filed
yesterday in the Superior Court.
Thomas B. Pheby Jr., as assignee of
his father, appears as plaintiff, and
i Thomas D. Carneal, executor of the
I will of the late W. W. Foote, is the
i defendant. The purpose of the suit is
j to recover $1050 with interest on an as-
I signment by Foote of 25 per cent of a
contract by which he was to be paid j
; 10 per cent of all property he might re- |
cover from the estate of James Q. Fair
for Mrs. Craven, whether in action |
brought in her interest as the widow
of the late millionaire, or otherwise. !
The plaintiff says that on May 20, ;
1899, Fowte got from Mrs. Craven a
contract by which he was to be paid
the 10 per cent referred to. On the ,
same day. it is alleged, Foote sold to !
Thomas B. Pheby Sr., father of the
plaintiff, a fourth interest in the con
tract for the sum of $1500, c-f which ',
$1000 was paid down and $500 subse- j
quently.
On May 1, 1902, it is alleged. Foote I
released Mrs. Craven from the con
tract upon the payment to him of $1500, ,
this release being without the knowl- i
edge of Thomas B. Pheby Sr. In June
of 1902, it is set forth, Mrs. Craven
compromised with the heirs of the late
James G. Fair for $50,000. Subsequently,
on December 22, 1903, it is said Foote
paid to Thomas B. Pheby Sr.. on ac
count of his contract, $200, but said .
nothing of the release.
The plaintiff sets forth that under i
his contract, which he released with
out right, Foote was entitled to 10 per
cent of the entire sum recovered by
Mrs. Craven, or $5000. Pheby, under the
terms of his agreement: with Foote. was
entitled, it is claimed, to $1250, or one
fourth of $5000. As only $200 was paid j
on this co-ntract the plaintiff holds that j
$1060 is still due and unpaid, and he \
asks that judgment for that amount j
with interest be given him against the |
estate of the late W. W. Foote.
Champagne Disappears.
Who drank thirty-six Quarts of
champagne at the benefit given at
Mechanics' Pavilion Tuesday night for
the San Francisco Women's Athletic
Association?" That is the problem
that Abe Becker, saloon ma' and ca
terer, asked Captain Burnett to solve
for him yesterday. Becker undertook
to supply the throng with wet goods
on that occasion. The gathering was
not a thirsty one, as a whole, for
Becker says he lost money, be
sides three cases of wine. Captain
Burnett could give him little consola- .

In Half a Round BERGER IS THE VICTOR Over Bill Rickards
CHICAGO BOXER
NO MATCH FOR
CALIFORNIAN
Visitor Shows No Style
Nor Aggressiveness.
Straight Left to the Head Brings Bout to
Sudden Endâ Ah Wing, the Chinese, Is
Defeated and House Is in an Uproar.
Bill Rlckards, with his Chicago rep
utation as a fighter, lasted just one
minute and twenty-three seconds in
his bout with Sam Berger last night
in Woodward's Pavilion.
The Chica^roan made a favorable im
pression on the spectatoiu until he pu
up his hands. That instant the illu
sion faded away, as It was evident h !
was the merest tyro at the boxini;
Came. This readily explains why no
one was allowed to see him train, a;Â«
the true report as to hip lack of ability
would have spread quickly where the
followers of boxers gather.
When he attempted to hit Berger hit
effort resembled that of an old woman
driving out flies with a towel. The bout
ended so Quickly that Berger did not
have an opportunity to extend him
self. He kept jabbing his opponent with
his left for a time and then suddenly
brought his riarht over. This connected
with Rickard 's head. He stood mo
tionless for several seconds and then
sank slowly to his hands and knees.
The spectators jeered at him. as they
thought he wanted to quit. He was up
.before the ten seconds elapsed. He
had no defense and Berger sent him
down and out with a sharp left and
right to the head. The latter blow
turned him completely around before
he went to the floor and was counted
out by George Harting.
The figrhts packed Woodward's pa
vilion from floor to ceiling. The crim
inally poor showing of Rickards was
not taken seriously by the spectators,
a? the remainder of the card was good.
Had Champion Jeffries met with de
feat it could not have created a greater
uproar than did the defeat of Ah Wing,
the Chinese champion. He met Mike
Kutchop, who looked for all the world
like I frog, with his spidery legs and
his abnormally developed chest.
Ah Wing gave his famous Imitation
of the La Blanche swing several times
MEEGAN CALLED
OUT FOREVER
Great Pitcher of Days Gone
,hy Passes Away at Home
After a Brief Illness
The baseball world lost one of Its
greatest stars on Tuesday afternoon
â  when Pete Meegran, better known as
"Steady Pete," was called out for the
last time. Twenty years ago Meegan
was one of the idols of the baseball
diamond. He starred in many a game
against such great ones as John Clark
scm. Goldsmith, Rathbone, Charley
Sweeney and others, who have long
since been lost to public view.
Pete Meegan was born in this city
forty-two years ago, and like many
other great players gained his early
experience in the sand lots of the Mis
sion district. His first rise to fame
came when he joined the wonderful aid
Haverley team and pitched it to vic
tory time after time. When Meej?an
beat the world-renowned Louisville
Colonels on the - Alameda grounds in
the early eighties his name and fame
were heard in every town that boasted
a baseball team. The Louisville? were
Invincible till they faced the curves of
Meegan. Twenty thousand cheering
fans watched the struggle. The quiet
suburban village never knew another
such demonstration as the one that fol
lowed the dethroning of the Colonels.
After pitching for the Haverleys In
this city for a number of years Meegun
went to the National League and the
American Association. He played with
Et. Louis, Philadelphia and other great
nines of the day and there won the dis
tinction of being one or the greatest
twlrlers of his day.
Meegan's great drop was the wonder
of the baseball world at the time. The
finest batsmen In the business were
fooled when they went against It. Pete
used to get hit hard at times, but his
steadiness always stood by him, and
thus he gained the nickname of
"Steady PÂ«te."
Meegan retired from the game more
than ten years ago and since that time
has made his home in this city. He
made a competency in baseball.
The dead pitcher is survived by. a

IJERKFXEY'S ROWING COACH
VISITS STANFORD CAMPUS
E. M. Garnett Trying to Bring About
Terms for Race on the Estuary
Between the Universities.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, March
15. â In an elfort to adjust the boating
controversy between the University of
California and Stanford University E.
M. Garnett, coach for the Berkeley
crew, visited the Stanford campus to
day and held a conference with the
boating authorities here. No agree
ment has been reached by the oars
men of the two universities and It is
understood Garnett'B visit to-day did
not further the cause of California, al
though nothing definite was given out
after the con*Â«rence. R. H. Gaither,
coech for the cardinal crew, at first
refused to entertain any proposition
from Garnett unless he would con
sider a course different from the pro
posed Oakland estuary straight-away,
on which the Initial intercollegiate
race was held last year.
Stanford refuses unconditionally to
row on this course, while the Berkeley
men are holding out as strongly for
the course. Coach Garnett endeavored
to show the oarsmen that the Oakland
waters were neen last year under un
[ favorable conditions and that arrange
ment* could be made this year to ob
viate such difficulties. His arguments
failed to convince the Stanford coach
and his men.
Hawthorne Club Fight*.
Al Toungr, matchmaker for the
Hawthorne Club, has necured seven
boxing bouts for his next show, which
is to take place on the 21st inst. The
main event is In the form of a "dou
ble header" and will be between the
following four boxen: Rouprh House
McDonald and Jack McLaughlin and
Johnny Crowe and X oun S Dempsey.
The "special" bout will be fought be
tween Harry Tenny and Johnny Mur
ray. The other four bouts are be
tween men who are evenly matched.
Famous Pacer Direct Is Dead.
NEW YORK, March IB. â Direct,
2:05^4, formerly the champion pacing
stallion and sire of many grand cir
cuit winners, dropped dead of rupture
of the heart at East View Farm,
James Butler's stock farm, to-day. He
was 20 years old and was valued at
about $5000. His heat of 2:06 is still
the world's high-wheel sulky record.
Draw for Ingleside Park.
Two stake's, to be run at Ingleside
Park on Sunday, will be drawn to
right at Eighth and Market streets.
Sufficient hares are expected from the
San Joaquin Valley to-day to provide
tiie running.
DR. LEGGO IS THIRD IN HANDICAP
Nigrette Assumes Lead at Start,
Easily Beating Gold Enamel.
Cloudlight, a Well Supported One,
Too Fast for Peggy O'Neil.
FRED E. MULHOLLAND
The last appearance this season of
Dr. Leggo was not a pronounced suc
cess. The derby winner was asked to
concede all the way from eleven to
twenty-one pounds to each of the
other five starters In the $1000 mile
handicap at Oakland, and failed to ac
complish the feat. #.t least the son of
Puryear D couldn't do it yesterday.
Big Beach was coupled in the betting
with Dr. Leggo'and laying 6 to 5 and
7 to 5 the layers found ready purchas
ers of paste boards. Nigrette looked in
| very light with 99 pounds, closing a
strongly backed second choice, after
once being 2& to 1. The Jennings mare
made a Cakewalk of it, leading
throughout and breezing home three
lengths ahead of Gold Enamel and Dr.
Leggo. Knapp rode the winner.
Three favorites managed to splash
over the mark in advance of their
fields. The track was very sloppy, with
a good footing out from the rail.
F. W. Barr, a bay colt by Kismet,
from the stable of Stanfield & Ellis,
captured the two-year-old sprint at
four and a half furlongs. Ridden by
W. Davis and a 6 to 5 tavorite, he as
sumed the front position turning into
the stretch and won galloping from
Lady King and Ebel Thatcher.
There was no demand for anything
but Emma Reubold in the betting on
the first six and a half furlong selling
run. Her price fell from z^ to 1 to 8
to 5 favoritism and Davis had her out
in front from start to finish. Both
Blackthorn and Brennus faded away
after an abbreviated display of speed,
the place going to Dandie Belle, a 15 to
1 shot.
Next followed the split of the six and
a half furlong number, which went to
Dora I, the mount of Lloyd Fountain.
This was a very open betting race, for
Profitable, Dr. Sherman. Budd Wade
and Hulford were all accorded suDUort.
the latter closing a slight favorite.
Blrkenruth nearly grabbed the purse
with Jahny Mellin's mare Laura F M,
once 50 to 1 in the ring. The outsider
made all the running and at the wire
only lost to Dora I by half a length.
Profitable, with Davis up, ran third.
Hulford got away poorly and could not
raise a gallop.
No doubt the presence in the saddle
of Davis on Anvil enabled the ad
mirers of Hainault to obtain a much
better price than they otherwise would
in the speculating on the mile and
fifty yard run. The brown gelding
looked a 1 to 2 chance, and some even
money was laid. Jones had him in
front from the first Jump and he fin
ished four lengths before Anvil at the
wire. Barrack came from the far rear,
nabbing the tiring Major Tenny for
show honors.
Played from 6 and 8 down to 3^.
Cloudlight, piloted by Birkenruth.
easily defeated Peggy O'Neil for the
concluding seven-furlong purse run.
The last named filly was at first in
stalled an even money favorite, but
when the Cloudlight and Rossbourne
money came to the top her price re
ceded to 2. Peggy cut out the pace
and was then downed with consum
mate ease by Cloudlight. The show
went to Rossbourne.
TRACK NOTES.
W. Davis rode the winners of the
first two races on the card. The
crack lightweight will probably leave
for New York on Sunday next, where
he will report- to Trainer Jack Joyner.
The stables of M. J. Daly, D. Zelin

the new Corrigan track at New Or
leans last evening. Before leaving
Cotton sold Langford James to Paddy

any reputable bookmaker from any
part of the country. Last year twelve
books cut in, and those of the layers

DR. CHADWICK
COLD TO WIFE
Upon Her Farewell Visit to
Her Home He Receives Her
in a Very Formal Manner
CLEVELAND, March 16.â Mrs.
Chadwick, accompanied by two deputy
i United States Marshals, left the coun
j ty Jail to-day in a closed carriage and
I was driven to her old home for a fare
i well visit. With the exception of JSOO
j worth of personal effects, exempt from
I the claims of creditors, all of the fur
l nishlngg and other personal property
â  in the house will be sold at public auc
| tion by Trustee Loeser next Friday.
1 Mrs. Chadwick was granted permis
sion by Judge Taylor of the Federal
i Court to visit her home to-day to de
| cide upon what property she would re
! tain.
It evidently was a trying ordeal for
| the convicted woman. Upon entering
the sumptuously furnished residence,
she broke down and wept bitterly. It
was her first visit to the house since
last November. When Mrs. Chadwick
had finally regained her composure
she began a tour of the house, select
ing such articles as she desired to
I keep.
She encountered Dr. Chadwick.
; Husband and wife at first merely
| smiled and nodded and t^ien in a for
i mal way shook hands. Only a few
I words were exchanged. Dr Chadwick
had not seen his wife for two months
when he last visited her at the jail.
Mrs. Chadwick selected between
$4000 and $5000 worth of personal prop
erty, which she claimed was exempt
under the statutes. Almost all of this
] was wearing apparel, and Nathan
Loeser, trustee in bankruptcy, said
that he would protest each and every
selection. Loeser said: "Mrs. Chad
wick selected enough clothing for
twenty-five women, which, in view of
the way she has squandered her cred
itors' money, I consider very bad
taste."
Before leaving the house Mrs. Chad
wick again broke down and gave way
Ito tears. She was allowed five min
utes with her husband, who only for
a moment showed signs of affection
or feeling for her. Replying to her
statement that she was absolutely in
nocent of the charges against her, Dr.
Chadwick said: "I hope you will be.

EIGHTY PER CENT FRENCH BARK IS REPORTED SAFE
AK .^ REINSURANCE AT EIGHTt PER CENT AND HEAVILY PLAYED BY LOCAL
J ThF* PORT l^ V r>*Y^ E AGO TED YESTERDAY AP SAKE ANP BEARING THE END OF HER
The reported speaking of the over
flue French bark Francois created
more than a ripple of joy yesterday on
the local -a Gi reinsurance specula
tion. The Francois was quoted at 80 '
per cent. For one day the rate stood
tt %l per cent, but heavy play here
and in London hammered it back to j
SO. At from SO to 80 per cent more j
than $50,000 had been placed in the j
hand? of M. A. Newell, to put on j
the Francois to arrive. The report re- ,
ceJverJ yesterday shows the vessel j
makir.gr sood progress toward her dcs- i
t.'nation. with all well on board and j
chip and cargo in good condition- It j
is almost certain now that she will
finish her voyage in safety and as soon i
as she is reported at Runcorn in good |
condition the men who put up xhS
550,00j will receive about . $250,000
for their investment- ;
It is a long time since local epecu- j
lators pulled off anything like a 4 to 1 I
*hot and there, was joy yesterday in .
theit ranks. '
Th. Francois left here 190 days ago i
for i.uncorn. She was reported on j
March 13 passing Fayal. in the Azores. :
f- nd will not be due at Runcorn for j
tone time.'yeu" 'On the: strength of I
.this speaking the rate on the Fran- i
cois was reduced to 15 per cent and j
there probably it will stand until she j
reaches her destination. . .
The other overdue* are quoted as j
follows: .The Frephfleld, 90 per cent; j
Oberon, 8 per cent, and Mars, 90 per
cent. !
Fnder Arrest Three Days.
The Pacific Mail Company's liner City of
Para arrived yesterday from Panama and way
ports. Chief Officer Cochlan, who was con
fined to his room under arrest when the vessel !
krft the isthmus, was restored to duty after !
two days' rustication. Coghlan, the last da;
is port at the Isthmus, put in many hours of
hard work superintending the loading of the
last cf the hcaeward-bound cars;o. It was 3
c' clock in the morning before he turned in
and two hours later he was on deck again |
petting ready for the vessel's departure. HlÂ»
locks did not please the esthetic taste of
Ceptain Brown, who appeared later fresh and 1
roey from a long night c sweet repose. Cogh
lar. wet tired and looked sleepy.
Brown took exception to his mate's way of
doing a certain piece of work. He spoke, it
1c sa:c. as one gentleman never speaks to
another. Coghlan tried to justify his action.
bat was shut up by the skipper.
"You've been drinking, sir. Go to your
room and stay there," said Captain Brown.
Cochlan has * good reputation for sobriety
and after two/days Captain Brown realised
tfcÂ« weakness of his m a case and restored
to Coghlan his yeilow Jacket. Coghlan would
rot diFcu*B the matter yesterday and Captain'
Brown said the whole thing was made up by â 
th*. officers of the Acapulco. Brown, however,
of e,U the officers on the - in, waa alone In
his dÂ«-c;al, but It Is probably true that he
will not report Coghlan for drinking.
Coghlan wa.s not the only disturber of Cap
ts.ln Brown's â  ace of mind. M. Sullivan.
FrM Pouiiett an<i George "Wickenden, employed
In the steward's department, were caught
skylarking la the gloryhole. At least that is
wfc2t thÂ» men say. The captain's report (-ays
they were drunk and insolent to a pats' njr"r
Thi 5 hacr^ned while the City of Para was
bir.g at PÂ«nama. -The thre* men were taken
UdMn and turned over to â¢â - native author
ities. They were tried. thÂ»-y say. by a dark
skinned Judge who spoke only Spanish. The
prosecution. <"aptaln Brown, was the only fide
corsuited and when the judge finished speak-
Ir.r en interpreter informed the three men
that they had been found guilty and had
bÂ«*n sentenced to pay a fine and serve eight
cayÂ« in Jail. At that time yellow fever wai
raping at Panama ' â ' â  the fear of catching
thÂ» dread disease added many fold to th*
men's punithment. During their eight dayÂ»
fcthor* thpy were compiled to dig wells and
"â¢wers in the blazing sun. At the expiration
of the time they were- returned to the City of
Fara. They refused, they Fay. to allow Cap-
Taln Brown to dÂ«>duct the amount of the fines
from their j>ay. The matter will be decided
by the United States Shipping Commissioner
Th* City of Para brought 2033 tons of cargo
and thirty-nine passengers. The officers of
the Para report affairs In Guatemala very un
settled and say that among the better class
of people in the republic there is growing a
very bitter feeling against President Cabrera.
A Frenchman, who traveled on the City of
Para from San Jose to Acapulco. said that
at Retalhuleu. where bis coffee flnca Ik
situated, things were getting too warm for
him and he had left to avoid entanglement

HONOLULU, March 15.â Rear Admi
ral Whiting, U. S. N., who fell last
night while alighting from a moving
electric car, sustained a scalp wound
and was unconscious for two hours,
but recovered after being taken to the
Queens Hospital.
Admiral Whiting will not be able to
continue his Journey on the Pacific
Mail steamship Siberia to Manila,
where he is to serve on naval courts
martial. The admiral's injuries are not
considered serious.
VALLEJO, March 15.â Captain B. F.
Drake of the Mare Island Navy Yard
received orders this evening to prepare
to sail for Manila on the next Oriental
liner leaving San Francisco, to take
the place of Rear Admiral Whiting on
the court-martial board which is to
Â«sit at Cavite to try Captain Briggs of
the cruiser Baltimore. The accident to
Admiral "Whiting at Honolulu Tuesday
is the cause of this order.
During the absence of Captain Drake
it is presumed that Lieutenant Com
mander Underwood, the new ordnance
officer, who is expected at Mare Island
daily, will act as captain of the navy
yard.

CANAL DIGGERS
NOT CONTENTED
City of Para Brings Word of
rnsatisfav'toryCondition of
Attain at the Isthmus
WANT FAIK TREATMENT
Engineers. Clerks and Labor
cis Claim They Are Victims
Of Gross Misrepresentation
The steamship City of Para, which j
arrived yesterday from Panama and
way ports, brings word of a condition |
of serious discontent among the men
employed at the isthmus in connection
with the work of digging the canal.
Laborers, clerks and engineers voice in
chorus a protest against the treatment
accorded them by the Canal Commis
sion. There is said to be a difference of
from 40 to 50 pr-' cent between the pay
promised at the time of hiring and'the
amount of salary actually paid. Engi
neers who left the United States ex
pecting to receive $150 a month lind
that $82 a month would be a fair esti
mate of their actual enumeration.
Many of those who could afford it have
returned to the Unted States and others
will leave as soon as they have saved â 
enough to pay for transportation. From
one end of the isthmus to the other,
skilled and unskilled labor, clerks and
stenographers, are performing their
work in a half-hearted manner.
A reduction of the first-class fare
from Panama to New York to $30 is
said to have been contemplated for the
benefit of those employed by the Canal
Commission. It was discovered, how
ever, that so general was the discon
tent that a $30 fare to New York would j
have meant a wholesale exodus from
the isthmus of all classes of labor. The
making of the proposed reduction has
been indefinitely postponed.
ENVY STKKKT (I.KANERS.
The lot of the white-garbed street
cleaners of New York is said to be en
vied by Yale and Harvard graduates
who went to Panama as civil engi
neers. The street cleaner's $2 a day is
sAid to be more real money than the
commission is paying for work of a
much higher class.
The expense and discomfort of life
on the isthmus are said to be greater
than represented and the outlook for
improvement is dim and uncertain. In
President Roosevelt's dissatisfaction ,
with conditions the men engaged in
doing the actual hard work see a ray of
hope, and a. reorganization of the com
mission uith a square deal for subor
dinates is what they expect when the
chief executive gets things as he wants
them.
Those of the dissatisfied who resigned
were not allowed transportation back
to the United States, and many clerks
and engineers are said to have returned
to New York as steerage passengers.
ONLY 75 TEXTS A DAY.
The dusky laborers recruited in the
Central American republics are also
complaining. One Dr. Taber, who act
fd as labor ageot for the French Canal
Company, is employed toy the United
States Commissioners in a similar ca
pacity. Taber has been 'gathering men
in Nicaragua. He shipped seventy
<"4ght to the isthmus on the City of
Peking, and the City of Para took sev
enty-nine from Corinto. These men ac
cuse Dr. Taber of having persuaded
them to go to Panama by moans of
misrepresentation as to the pay. At
<'orinto they were able to earn $2 a
day, Mexican money. All they are paid
on the isthmus for much harder work
is $t 50 a day in Colombian money, or
about T5 cents gold for a day's work.
These men are returning to Nicaragua
as fast as they can get away from Pan
ama.
WAR IS RAGING
OVER RHUBARB
(Trowel's Are Contending to
Control Local Market and
Householders Save Coin
Rhubarb, the plant that servfs every
spring in the East to cool the blood of
the hibernating population that has fed
for some months on buckwheat cakes,
is having precisely the opposite effect
on the rhubarb raising people of Ala
meda County and also on commission
men in this city in this month of
March. In fact, a rhubarb war is on.
Anybody can cause rhubarb to grow
in the valleys and lowlands of Califor
nia, but there are localities where it
comes to maturity earlier than in oth
ers, and those who grow the first rhu
barb have the market for their own.
At this time San Lorenzo and San
Leandro are the rhubarb centers of
California. A little later Watsonville
and the region round about will be in
the field. In Alameda County is what
is known as the Rhubarb Growers' As
sociation, which sends a carload of the
plant to the East nearly every day and
also forward to the San Francisco
market. Recently the association has
been trying to get all rhubarb produc
ers in its locality to unite with it and
fix a price. This has not been a com
plete success. In fact, when the first
move failed, the association came into
the field as a rate cutter, the supposed
purpose being to force the outsiders to
come in as members.
Yesterday, in pursuance of this pol
icy, the association notified the dealers
in this city that the association desired
to have all its goods sold, for the pres
ent, at about one-half of the ruling
rate. The figures were quoted and
caused gteat surprise. The outsider
producers would seem to have been
taken wholly by surprise, as their
prices were much higher than those of
the association. Some dealers found
that there was no need of cutting
prices.
Householders in this city have been
accustomed to paying more and there
was no seeming advantage to the deal
ers in demoralizzing the market. Nev
ertheless any sharp buyer could get
rhubarb for almost any price he would
name yesterday. Possibly the sam*
general conditions will exist for a few
days and new war measures may even
be devised by the rhubarb growers be
fore the contest is over
Cascade Affair Investigated.
United States Local Inspectors Bolles
and Bulger held an Investigation yes

at midnight and Captain Edward
Jahnsen, the master and pilot, explain
ed it by saying that his compasses

A resolution bearing on Asiatic labor
and proposed by T. F. Marshall and
seconded by I. I. Reboli was adopted
unanimously by the Central Labor
Council of Alameda County at its regu
lar meeting last Monday evening. It
is as follows:
Wh"reas, The leaders of public opinion in
'his State, lrresDective of class or political
affliations. have awakened to the- danger that
threatens to swam;> the labor market with
unfair i-omnetition fr^m Asiatic immigrants.
wheas alarming increase in numbers and un
ceasing activity are felt In every department
of labor and constitute a menace to existing
conditions that has to he reckoned with; and
Whereas. The conditions under which those
win, . oTistltutf this class of labor have ex
isted In their own country are far below the
standard of livinft in these United States; ar.d
when labor from such a source is placed in
competition with citizens of this land, the
time has arrived to prevent a continuancs M
the evil; and
Whereas. TheÂ» tardy awakening of the press
to the impending danger Is calculated tot
limw the nation to a lively sense of the n'
ce:Â»sity of enacting such restrictive laws as
shall be capable of grappling with this debas
ing comretiti^n; be it, therefore.
Resolved. That we call upon the representa
tives of 'his State, in both the Senate and
House of Representatives at Washington, to
take immediate steps to have enacted n. law
that will effectually exclude from these United
States immigrants from Japan and all who by
law are classed as Mongolians.

Aertisation Formally Made That Of

for Reward.
WASHINGTON. March 15.â Charges
have been filed with Samuel Gnmpers,
president eC the American Federation
or Labor, which are said to reflect on
the integrity of individuals connected
with the subway and elevated railroad
strike in New York. Gompers said the
charges would be investigated.
It is said that the charges contain
allegations that the strike was engi
neered for the sole purpose of beiag
broken. Officials of the unions, it Is
declared, received, or expected to re
ceive, a large reward for bringing
about that strike.
OBJKCT TO PAYING FEES
FOR OFFICIAL INSPECTION"
Hfwitt Lays Complaint Before Super-
TlMn an<! Wants Money for
Fourth Street Work.
Chief Hewitt of the Department of
Electricity yesterday referred to the
Supervisors a complaint filed by H.
Relheimer and Vanderlynn Sto*r
against the exaction of inspection fees
on the part of gas and electric fix
ture houses. The ordinance imposes
a fee of "5 cents an hour to cover the
expense of inspection during the in
stallation of electrical wires and ap
paratus and the protests nts maintain
that it was not intended to cover the
construction work on fixtures.
Hewitt also notified the Supervisors
that the Board of Electricity Commis
sioners refuses to permit him to pro
ceed with the Fourth-street under
ground work until $255 has been set
aside to pay handling decorative poles
on Market street and the cost of re
placing the city's wires on Fourth
street.
Found With Lottery Tickets.
William Cavanasrt was arrested
yesterday by Officers Mitohel and Cor
nelius on Grove street on suspicion of
having lottery tickets in his posses

when Cavanagh was searched in the
City Hall station 111 brand new tick
ets were found stowed away in his
inside vest pocket. He was charged
with the offense and locked up pend
ing bail in the sum of $100, which
was furnished by the agent from
whom he bought the tickets.

RAPID INCREASE
OF SPEAKEASIES
Places Adjacent to Soldiers'
Homes Where Drinks May
Be Quietly Obtained
CANTEEN LEGISLATION
Xo Apportionment of Federal
Money to Institutions That
Permit Liquor to Be Sold
Congress has again declared against
the maintenance of the canteen at
State soldiers' homes. The Bell
amendment prohibiting the apportion
ment of Federal money to any State
that permits tha sale of wine, beer m
whisky on the Home premises has
been continued In force for another
year. It was disclosed in the recent
debate in the House of Representa
tives that the State Home. Bath. Km
York, and the California Home in Napa
County were the only State institu
tions afTected. Congressman Rider in
eommentlngr on the amendment is
quoted In the Congressional Record aÂ»
saying: "In consequence of the pas
sage of this amendment there have
grown up in Bath alone within the past
year thlrty-flve speakeasies that the
soldiers patronize. "
Gossip from Washington is to the
effect that the Influence of the
mans Christian Temperance Union is
powerful at the National Capitol. The
ladies are strongly opposed fo the can
teen in any form. There were no pro
tests from California against the aboli
tion of the canteen. Senator Perkins
on his return from Washington last
summer remarked that the Senate nni
simply overwhelmed by the ladies who
had secured the adoption of tha
amendment in the House.
The number of saloons in Yountville
California, and vicinity has materially
increased since the canteen was abol
ished and many of the prohibitionists
who were at the outset so earnestly
in favor of the sumptuary legislation
are beginning to entertain doubts as
to the moral value of restrictive meas
ures. The death rate at the California
Home has not been diminished in the
slightest degree by the abolition of
the canteen. In the savings of money
by the veterans themeselves there has
been a decline and there is no increase
in remittances to dependent rela-
The fact seems tr> be well established
that the veterans are now spending
more money for whisky than they
1 when the canteen was In full
blast.
The directors of the Callfornia\Home
have not in any manner sought to in
fluence a member it Congress or* a
member of the Legislature in favor of
the restoration of the canteen. They
are quite willing that the restrictive
measures recommended by the Wo
man's Christian Temperance r
and other advocates of prohir
shall be fully, fairly and impar
tested. The agit^tors who fancied that
the board would make an appeal
ia "Vngress for a restoration of th>Â»
canteen were quite non-plused when
they found that no protest from Cali
fornia had be^n recorded.

save the annoyance and expense of moving and
shipping my furniture I will sell the same for
$620, together with my option on the house,
which Is worth $15 per month more than I pay.

SEA DWELLERS
FIGHT SALOONS
Oceanside People Appear Be
fore Police Commission to
Oppose Doscher Transfer
PERSONALITIES FIGURE
Secretary Boyne Steps Be
tween Belligerent Pair to
Prevent Physical Clash
The Police Commissioners met last
night to proceed with the trials of
Chief of Police Wlttman and Sergeant
Shaw, but upon motion of Congress
man Kahn the officers' attorney, who
was indisposed, their cases went over
until Monday night. Sentencing of
Sergeant Ellis was also postponed.
Sergeants Brophy and Fraher were ac
quitted of charges of neglect of dutyâ
a popular verdict, as they are efficient
officers.
The commission transacted its regu
lar business. Residents of the Oceanside
section of San Francisco, armed with a
monster petition and stores of elo
quence, appeared before the commis
sioners to protest against the granting
of a transfer of the saloon license of
Henry Doscher. Doscher is conducting
a saloon, called the Hotel Ray, on the
ocean boulevard, or Great Highway,
near Ingleside. He has asked for the
privilege of transferring his business to
the highway, between L and M streets,
which location is in the heart of Ocean
side.
After debate and argument had been
exhausted, the opponents became heat
ed and indulged in personalities that
threatened to become warlike. The
fighting propensities of the witnesses
were discouraged by the board, after
Secretary Boyne had stepped between
two belligerents.
The chief speaker on behalf of the
beach residents was D. H. Biggs, who
told of the history of liquor licenses on
the boulevard. He aggressively at
tacked the proposed transfer and ap
pealed to the board not to allow it. He
said that over 20 per cent of the voters
in the district opposed the saloons and
if the position of the Board of Police
Commissioners was different and it was
satisfied the people were not. He than
read that portion of the charter cover
ing the powers of the Commissioners
and closed by saying that the residents
were not fighting the liquor trade or
saloon business, but did not want it at
their doors.
D. Edward Marchus. secretary of thÂ«
Oceanside Improvement Club, next
took the floor. His opening remarks
called forth a statement from Commis
sioner Reagan that the board was not
antagonistic to the residents and would
oppose the granting of any new
licenses on the Great Highway. Rea
gan added that in the granting of a
transfer he was not prepared to so
pledge himself. President Poheim
said the evil existed in restricting li
censes and that the more granted the
better, as many saloons would force
the cheap ones out of business. Rea
gan strongly dissented from this view.
ROWD.YISM ALLEGED.
Marchus, in continuing, spoke of
rowdyism, automobiling parties and
drunkenness at the beach. His state
ments were breathlessly seconded by
Mrs. Sorbier, president of the Outdoor
Art League, and Richard Barker of
the Improvement Club. The latter laid
much stress on rowdyism at the beach
and on cars returning therefrom.
Later in the evening Police Captain
Gleeson of the district was called by
the commissioners and told of the steps
he had taken to suppress rowdyism.
After stationing uniformed and plain
clothes men at the beach and on cars
and hearing their reports he had con
cluded that reports of disorder at the
beach were greatly exaggerated. Every
effort to suppress it oh the cars is be
ing use, he said.
The other Oceanside residents who
did the talking were Mrs. Jessie Rob
ertson, Professor W. T. Wenzell. Mrs.
Charles Patriarch and Alma Keith.
Things became lively when Attorney
Thomas Keogh began his answer on
behalf of Doscher. He first discredited
the representation from the beach,
claiming that Oceanside was divided
against itself on the saloon question,
to the scorn and amazement of the
beach coterie.
Arthur C. Campbell, a contractor,
was very indignant at being named in
th<? petition as an unprincipled man
and made many charges against Mar
chus.
FIST FIGHT PREVENTED.
Marchus advanced to refute Camp
bell's statement with his fists, when
Boyne stepped between them and Pres
ident Poheim cautioned all belligerents.
Henry Doscher, when questioned as to
the place he intended to run replied
quietly. "An honorable business." The
decision of the board was reserved until
Monday night, all witnesses being ex
cused from further attendance.
After ceremonious calling of Patrol
men Munn, Doran, O'Brien, McGrath.
Heinz and Sergeant Ellis, all accused
of taking bribe money in Chinatown,
Commissioner Reagan announced that
he had received a telephone message
from the defendant's attorney, Mogan,
saying he was ill and sentence was de
ferred until next Wednesday night.
In the cases of Sergeants Fraher and
Brophy, Captain Duke was placed on
the stand and testified that he had in
structed the sergeants not to interfere
with gambling, as the action of uni
formed men might jeopardize the
chances of the Chinatown squad in
making raids or collecting evidence.
The verdict of acquittal was im
mediate and unanimous.
thf> ground that the bid of the latter at 8^
cents was lower than that of the Post and
under the charter the Journal of Commerea
was entitled to the contract. The committee
toolt the ground that the Journal of Commerce
had not filed affidavits of circulation and pub
lication with Its blri and the neglect to do so
required the rejection of its bid.
WOMAN ARGUES CASE. â Miss B. Taylor,
acting ajÂ» her own lawyer, was on. hand in
Jurlgrf Proutt f> court to face alone the assaults
upon the will of the late James D. Taylor
The will is being contested by Mrs. L. T. Me-
BrMo, a sister of the deceased. Miss Taylor
is executrix of the testament and holds that
she can defend it better than any practitioner
at the bar. The caae ie now on argument anU
will be submitted fcr decision within the week.
WINE NOT POISONED. BUT KILLED
CAT. â As far as the police are concerned the
Investigation Into the alleged attempt to pol-
Hor Mrs. Joseph Marshall, 1112 Powell street,
has been abandoned. City ,Chemist liothe no

locked against him â an embarrassing
fact that necessitated his going to an
uptown rooming-house for accommo
dations for himself and a bride of only
a few weeks.
Major Lynch-Blosse had seen hard
service in India and South Africa, and
this fact is said to have been respon
sible for his selection by the British
War Department for the duty In the
Orient to which he had been assigned.
Arriving in this country three months
ago, the major and the other officers,
who had been dispatched to the Far
East on a similar mission, were receiv
ed In New York society and enter
tained most lavishly.
WEDS CHICAGO GIRL.
In Washington and Chicago they
were the recipients of equally cordial
courtesies. While in Chicago the major
met and successfully wooed the daugh
ter of one of the Windy City's most
prominent grain operators, and after
a wedding, which was celebrated on a
most elaborate scale, the British offi
cer and his handsome bride proceeded
to this city, where they arranged to
sail on the steamship Siberia for Japan.
Unfortunately, however, for the major,
his reception in this country had so
overwhelmed him that he was loath to
leave for the Orient on the date ar
ranged, and, instead, entered on a
merry time that rapidly depleted his
ready funds. There were trips up and
down the coast, dinners at clubs and
hotels and many other affairs that
nelpad to make the major forget that
time and money were fleeting. Hia
bride, It is said, remonstrated with
him for his reckless expenditures, buf
he heeded not her advice, and would
probably have been going yet had not
the hotel incident suddenly interfered
with his plans.
Accompanying the first request of
the hotel people for a settlement were
demands from other and more impa
tient creditors, among them a local
railroad agent who had cheerfully ad
vanced the major money during the
early days of his visit to San Fran
cisco.
"WAIT TILL DRAFT COMES."
"Wait until my draft comes," was
the substance of the appeal made by
the major for further time, but pa
tience finally reached Its limit and
drastic measures were adopted to bring
the officer to a sudden realization that
a settlement would be much more
preferable to those to whom he is In
debted than his promises. Yesterday
the major, looking anything but the
debonair individual of a few weeks ago,
was hurrying about town looking
for relief, but with little success. He
offered big commissions for introduc- i
tions to some of the local money lend
ers, and tried in other ways to per- |
suade acquaintances to advance him a !
few thousand dollars, but failed to
make the borrow.
Strangely enough, his British friends
seemed to have deserted him in his j
hour of trouble, and night found him i
apparently resourceless. It is claimed I
however, that Major Lynch-Blosse is j
well connected in England, and that
his present embarrassments will only
be temporary and that the next steam- :
ship for the Far East will find him and
his bride passengers on their way to j
now scones of duty.

It is quite evident that skillful manipula
tion la at the bottom of much of the present
r!Â« In ttocks Improving peace prospects, the
reduction in the Bank of England rate and
continued strength of the London market in
fuced fr*Â«h life into the bull contingent In
this market, but it ehouid be remarked there
la conspicuous absence of genuine buyers at
current price*. Investor* are not taking
â¢tocks at these figure* and the public is not
â peculatltfr to any extent for the reason that
nearly ill conservative and reputable com-
Riee'.oc houses are cautioning their customers
agra-i-st r-un^ir^ on thÂ« long eide at this time.
The result is the big holden are not distribu
ting their Hocks as freely as they desire, nor
are they likely to dispose of them very easily
at this* level. Perhaps this explains in part
cur continued high loans. The market is liable
to b*> bu'leS into M nation. and a sharp break
then will be needed to galvanize it into fresh
activity. A moderate decline occasionally here
arter will prove beneficial by checking over
conSience aud introducing a new buying ele-
Biert that will not eater without inducements.
There are no bear arguments in eight, but the
eiarket n-.ay eaon need some readjustment
upon a more natural basis.

who â¢cared the May up to 7.87. .
On the rta* there was heavy proflt- taking,

New York-Stock Market.
NEnv YORK, March 15â There was a rem
nant at speculative spirit In the stock market
to-day, but it waa somewhat chastened and
made itaelt manifest in a conservative way.
The movement â a* hesitating and Irregular.
ThÂ« fluctuations for the greater part of the
day. however, were above last night's level
ar.c it waa not until the latter part of the
Â»Â»:>.-. :i that any considerable Inroads were
made on prices. Dlepatchea from Cblc&go de
tailiiig the enormous outlay contemplated by
the railroads for equipment for 1905 caused
a cpurt in the various car and locomotive
company â cits. There were published com
pilation*'of the extensive traffic to originate
la the southern territory on account of the
activity in the Southern iron trade and the,
large cotton crop to bÂ« moved, which led
â¢t^aightway to the marking up t>f stocks of
the Southern group of railways. Lees was
heard of tbe recent rumors regarding the
Van>ic rbllt* and Pacifies, but they also held
their periods of strength. Foreigners Mere
Inclined to â ell Americans again, the move
ment coubtless originating in France and Ger
many as a protective measure againct Rus
eian holdings. It Is Interesting to note, how
ever, that the London Statist, In an extensive
rtvitw cf American proeptets. assorts a con
vlctjjo that a large â > >* men! of European
capital Into American investments is immi
nent, owfcig to the great expansion of pro
ductive facilities which promises to be re
<julrf4 in this country. The Statist conclude!
by faying: "In spite of the growth In r im
ports into and the decline in export* from
the United States, and also in 'ace of the un
precedented expenditures of American tour
ist* '.n Europe this ear. there may be In
the net <!istar.t future signs that the gold
â¢which recentlj- itÂ« been exported from New
York to nurop* will return to the Tfilted
States." Thie operation would be brought
about by a rise in money rates h*re. The
advance In the call loan rate to-day to 4
â per cent seems to hare been Immediately due
to the withdrawal of government depoelts
with the rational backs, but the effect of the
interior demand for currency it looked for
In New York by the end of March and la
taJcer. some account of la the current outlook.
Price* sold off rather sharply on thÂ« rise
In the call loan rate and the day's advances
wer* much reduoed- or entirely wiped out.
Active discussion of th* proposed stock trans
fer tax co&tir.ued a rather discouraging fac
tor in the trad'.iur.
Tl.e tnarhet clow-d easy in spite of the letÂ©
wboucd to 6Tt In Ontario eb<l Western,
Bends' were steady. Total sales, par value,
$3,920,000.
TTrited States bonds were aM tiuchang^d on
call. V: V '

This advertisement, published in The
Call, made the stage of the theater look
like a babies' convention yesterday.
There were dark babies, fair babies,
noisy babies, quiet babies and babies
of. all kinds, whose proud parents were
eager to thrust them into the glare of
the footlights
Alma and Alda. Paulsen. aged ten
months each, got the positions. The
two little bits of Humanity will draw
star saiaries in the "Virginian" and
support their 19-year-old mother,
B. A. Paulsen. The girl mother
has been in desperate straits of late.
Her husband has been out of work and
money to pay milk bills for two
thy little ladies, ten months old,
was hard to get.
Nov. Alma and Alda will pay their
own board bill, if you please, and help
mamma out considerably. They are
actresses at present. They must fore

It sounded quite natural when
â¢ -ied it yesterday.
James D. de Wolf, who advertised
for babies, wanted tn escape when the
twins began t<> arrive. They oame in
bunches. The parent generally held
;i ad her next door neighbor con
:he <.ther.
DRm F> OF TWINS ARRIVE.
Wit there were eight sets of twins
and sixteen women on the stage, De
Wolf began to look worried. "And they
talk about race suicide." he said. "I'm
all In here. Does anybody want to be
judge of this baby show? I haven't
the heart to turn any of them down."
R. Pincus of the Columbia Theater
came to the rescue. He produced a let
ter from Mrs. D. E. Humphrey, a
neighbor of Mrs. Paulsen. The letter
told of the hard struggle that th*- little
Â£irl mother was making to keep her
liabies.
"They get the job." De Wolf said
Quickly, as soon as he read it. "We'll
laise their wages, too. But I can't tell
the others their twins won't do."
It was a hard task, but Pincus finally
nerved himself ui> to do it. The disap
pointed ones took away their candi
dates and comparative peace reigned.
Just after the weighty decision wa*
made, T. KTshoto, good, honest, indus
trious Japanese cook, arrived. So did
Mrs. Kishoto and a baby carriage con
taining Wistaria and Chrysanthemum
Kirhoto.
De Wolf ambushed himself behind a
canvas forest, but the Jap followed
him. "Please excuse," said Kishoto;
"here are twins."
"I don't want any more twins." de
clared De Wolf. "We have twins to
burn."
"Please excuse," said the Japanese.
'T do not want to have my twins burn- j
cd." And the Kishoto family departed ;
in a hurry. The Jap explained to his
wife that the Columbia Theater want
ed babies for fuel.
The Paulsen twins and a pair called j
Mildred and Myrtle Sweeney posed for I
photographs. The quartet was bun- i
dled into a basket. When the fond !
mothers started to extricate them. Mrs.
Paulsen grabbed a Sweeney and Mrs.
Sweeney drew a Pau'sen.

Wolf showed the wisdom of Solomon in
this emergency.
"Put them all back in the basket and
shufflo th.^ pack again." he suggested.
On the third hand the babies were dealt
out satisfactorily.
I'ntil 5 o'clock babies continued to ar
rive. Two women from N'atoma street
came at 4 o'clock, each carrying a
leather lunged vocalist. "They ain't
twins." one irf Ihrm explained. "Mick
ey's mine and Dickey's hers, but they
look alike. "
Just ih^n Mickey reached out and
jabbed hi? rl&t into Dickey's eye.
Dickey let out a wail that shook the
building.
"They've got to be twins." insisted
De Wolf. "Mickey and Dickey won't
do."
Th.-> twins are needed for the first act
of "The Virginian, " which will be
played next week. Their christening
as Fayette and Leonidas is the hit of
the act. During the festivities the ba
bies art mixed.
"This was a tough job," said De
Wolf, after the migration of twins
ceased. "It's harder than getting rat
tle for ' 'Way Down East.' I'm glad it's
over. I've seen and heard enough of
babies to-day to last a while."
Mrs. Paulsen was effusive in her
thanks t > De Wolf and the Columbia
Theater management.
KNOCKS A PRESS AGENT
UNCONSCIOUS WITH A BLOW
.John World. Vaudeville Performer,
Resents Alleged Slight of Wife
in XoAvspaner Xotiec^.
The performance of "The Burgomas
ter" on the Tivoli stage was interrupt
ed on a recent evening by an alterca
tion between Gerald Dillon, press agent
of the theater, and John World, a vau
deville actor, which end< d in a blow
that rendered Dillon unconscious for
several minutes. World, who is the
husband of Miss Mindell Kingston, a
new soubrette engaged for the produc
tion, accused Dillon of purposely
omitting to mention his wife in his
press notices. Dillon replied that he
did not know of Miss Kingston's en
gagement until last Thursday, after
he had sent his notices to the papers.
World told Dillon he lied and the lat
ter repeated that he was not aware
that Miss Kingston was a member of
the company until it was too late to
make the announcement in the j pa
pers.
World, who had worked himself
into a state of great excitement, there
upon advanced upon Dillon, who had
his hands in his pockets and did not
suspect that he was going to be at
tacked. World struck Dillon on the
bridge of the nose with his clenched
Qct and Dillon fell to the floor uncon
scious. Confusion reigned among the
members of the company, some of
whom rushed to administer restora
tives to Dillon, while others hustled
World from the scene. Dillon re
vived after a few minutes, but has
not fully recovered from the blow yet.
He is considering the advisability of
having World arrested for his cow
ardly attack.

Promotion of Popular Santa Fe Offi
cial Necessitates a Change In
Headquarters.
The promotion of Edward Chambers,
general freight agent of the Santa Fe
Railroad lines west of Albuquerque, to
the yosition of assistant freight traffic
manager, with headquarters in this
city, is a pleasing bit of information
to local railroad men, where the new
appointee is highly regarded in both
transportation and business circles.
Chambers has been connected with the
Santa Fe Company for many years.
He entered on hie railroad career in a
most humble position, but soon earned
for himself a splendid reputation as a
traffic man.
The position of general freight agent,
with headquarters in Los Angeles, will
be filled by Chambers' present assist*
ant. W. G. Barnwell. The promotions
were made on the personal judgment
of President Ripley, who is now in
Southern California enjoying his va

TAILOR TELLS
OF SHOOTING
Detective Swears That "Kid"
<Â» onduji 1 Was One of the
Footpads on Fatal Night
After a delay caused by the illness
of Jim .r Van tterpen, the Goucher trial
was resumefl yesterday morning in
Judge Carroll Cooks court. During the I
day Detective James H. Taylor, who j
is the principal witness for the prose- 1
cation, took the stand and told the
story nf the killing of Policeman Rob
inson in the early morning of January
21, 1902. Taylor's, testimony was dam
aging to the youthful defendant, and
hit father was constantly objecting
r.nd being overruled by the court.
In the morning session Joseph Brach
mann, who formerly conducted a pawn
shop on Third street, between Market
and Mission, testified that a man re
sembling Frank WoodÃ, a codefendant
in the, present trial, came to his shop
to purchase cartridges, and was ac
companied by a youth resembling
"Xii" Goucher, the accused.
Sergeant Campbell in the afternoon
told of finding ?he coat of Frank Woods
in a vacant lot near the scene of the
shooting of Robinson.' ..The coat had
two bullet holes in it that corresponded
vith two wounds on Woods body.
Detective Sergeant Dinan told how he
and Detective Taylor found the bullet
holes nnd how he marked them at the
time with chalk for further identifica
tion, i
There was absolute silence in the
courtroom ac .Detective Taylor told
simply and briefly the story of the
shooting. Despite the frequent inter
ruptions of Attorney Goucher. who is
sparing no effort to save his son. the
witness told a cledn story. He related
how he and Policeman Robinson start
ed out from the Seventeenth-street sta
tion in plain clothes and separated at
Sixteenth and Valencia streets af It
o'clock on the night of January 20, 1902.
Early in the morning of the 21et Tay
lor heard a pistol shot, soon followed
by a volley, and ran in the direction
of Sixteenth and Valencia, whence the
sounds came. In the clear moonlight
three men turned the corner and came
toward hfrrf. One 1 Woods) was being
assisted to run along by Henderson and
Goucher. Taylor insisted that he iden
tified all three men, and could not be
mistaken.
Taylor called on them to halt, and
the reply was a shot. The men dashed
into 1 Julian avenue after firing two
more shots. While pursuing the men
through Julian avenue Taylor shot
Henderson and disarmed and hand
cuffed him. The other two escaped.
Taylor then told of the search for
Goucher after the shooting and the in
ability of the police to locate him.
Finally, after two years, he was found
in the Stillwater penitentiary in Min
nesota, where he was finishing a term
for grand larceny.
District Attorney Byington then ask
ed Taylor to repeat any conversations
[ he had .with the prisoner when return
ing' from Minnesota. Instantly Sen
ator Ooucher was on his l'eet object
j ing. He sa-id the testimony of the av
| eragc detective could not be relied
upon: that if no conversation occurred
1 detective would manufacture one.
Byingtoivobjected to the remark and
1 was sustained by the court.
The conversations between the de
tective and the prisoner, however, had
1 little bearing on the case. Late in the
i afternoon the defense took up the
cross-examination of the witness, at
tempting without much success to up
j set his testimony by quoting his for
mer testimony in the trial of Frank
i Wood*. The case will go on to-day at
10 o'clock.
YOELL CONTEST
NEARS THE END
Audience Enjoys Argument
of Counsel for Disappoint
ed Heirs and Proponents
Confident that a rhetorical feast was
in store for them, more than a hundred
, people, who have been watching the
fortunes of the Yoell will contest be-
fore Judge Kerrigan assembled yes- i
terday to hear the argument in the !
big case. They were not disappointed, j
Attorney William Hit df the firm of !
Bishop, Wheeler & Hoeffler, opened
the argument on behalf of the contest- j
ants and D. M. Delmas occupied the af- â¢
ternoon with an exposition of the con
tentions of the proponents of the tes- ,
tameht. Rix has the style of the es- i
sayist; he cuts clean and close to the
line, without effort at dramatic effect.
Delmas. noted for his oratorical abil- '
ity, crowned each point of law and I
fact with a wreath of "rhetorical bios-
Bomi and the intense interest of his
audience evidenced its appreciation of
his efforts.
Rix attacked the will from every
standpoint. He assaulted its justice
and assailed Its legality because it was
evolved from an unsound mind. It
should fall, he said, because it assumed
a condition existed that did not exist;
that the contestants had been reward
ed through assignment of a division of
property between the testator and his
wife, their mother. This condition, ho
said,- did not prevail, and by denying
the contestants their rightful share in
the estate the testator had : enriched
one child at the expense of others â a
condition unnatural and illegal.
Mr. Delmas based his main attack on
the rights of the contestants upon the
position occupied by Emily C. Yoell, ;
widow of the testa.tor, who, at the time
of her separation from J. Alexander
Yoell, was given by him one-half of
Ms estate. It Is she, Mr. Delmas said,
who is in fact the contestant of the
will, though her children appear as the
contestants of record. He said:
â¢ This man wbo has now passed away was
driven from his home by these people "driven
from among the flowers .he hao watt-red foi
years and driven from th* shade of thf sweep
ing trees of his Santa Clara Valley home he
loved so well. At the time of ttile occurrence
he came to this city and met his wife at
the office of an attorney. There an agreement
Was -drawn up by the terms of which this old
man surrendered one-half of the estate he haa
accumulated through thrift and industry. Un
d*r the terms of this contract Mrs Yoell
agreed to care for and maintain her children
out of her chare of the estate. By the terms
of this agreement Mrs. Toell bound herself in
solemn, manner not to seek to control in any I
manner the estate â¢ remaining in the hands of i
her husband, and she surrendered all right and
title to the same.
' However, the fact stands that It is she
that is the real contestant in this case. Two
of .the three contestants here hare given her
their power of attorney. She employed coun- I
sel to bring this contest and it was" she that
employed her own son, John H. Yoell, to as
sair the memory of her husband, his father,
vvnen J: Alexander Yoell gave to his wife
one-half of hia estate at the time of their
eeparatlon and she agreed to care for hÂ«r
children, he absolved himself from future re
sponsibility, and the fact stands that when
this atrpement was signed he had done his
full duty toward these heirs that now seek to
set aside his will, and In full justice they !
have no claim against his estate. They have
already been provided for.
The argument probably will end to
day and the case be submitted to the
Jury.

DELAYS RETIHX OF TAXES
PAID OX SPECIAL LEVY
Point Rnlsetl That Amendment Af
fects Only Those Who Protested
Worries Auditor Bachr.
An anonymous correspondent hav
ing raised the point yesterday that the
recent constitutional amendment pro
viding for the return of the taxes paid
in for the special levy for schools and
hospital in 1902 is designed to afford
relief only to those who have protest
ed and brought suit against the city
was the cause of Auditor Baehr's sub
mitting the question to his legal ad
viser for an opinion. If the point is
correct it will necessitate the filing of
protests and the bringing of suits for
the return of the taxes. Baehr thinks
the matter of sufficient importance to
delay the issuing ojf demands for the
return of the taxes paid. Me will con
tinue to prepare the demands, but
will not distribute them until the legal
question has been settled to his sat
isfaction.
