CHICAGO, May 30.â There was nothing
done on either side of the teamsters'
strike to-day, but active hostilities are
promised for to-morrow, and the chief
trouble Is expected to come in the lumber
district
In addition * to the lumber teamsters
Who are now out, there will, in all prob
ability, be a strike of all the men em
ployed by thirty-five sash and door fac
tories, as these concerns have announced
that to-morrow they will continue mak
ing deliveries to boycotted houses. Ap
plication has been made by them to the
officers of the Employers' Teaming Com
pany for 225 drivers, and these will be
sent Into the lumber district to-morrow, j
The number of union men who are'ex
pected to strike by noon to-morrow, is
about 206, and it is expected that the ex
tension of the strike will cause more riot
ing In that part of the city. The police
declare, however, that they are abund
antly able to handle the situation.
A break in the ranks of the Team Own
ers' Association occurred to-day. The
members of this organization', have
throughout the strike acted more with
the teamsters than they have as allies of
the Employers' Association, and have for
the greater part refused to make deliv
eries .to boycotted . bouses. The Weaver
Coal Company, \u25a0 one cf the largest con
cerns In the city, announced this after
noon that commencing to-morrow \it
would make deliveries of coal to all boy
cotted houses. The firm employs â¢ fifty
drivers, and it is expected they will all
walk out in the morning. There were to
day several rumors of peace negotiations,
but none of them amounted to anything.

Later the' King, exchanged visits
â¢with President Loubet. To-night Lou
bet gave a gala dmner at the Elysee
Palace In honor of, his Majesty. In
the course of the dinner the King and
the President exchanged cordial toasts.
The Presidont gave expression to the
warm sympathy existing between the
two nations, saying that for the ful
fillment of the task before them it
Teas only necessary for the politicians
at Parisand Madrid to follow nature.
The countries were everywhere neigh
bor* and ought to *c friends, showing
confidence in each ot"her and mutually
supporting pacWc efforts. l.^.
In reply Alfonso' said that the re
ception given nim -showed the perfect
accord existing between France and
Spain, which would serve to strengthen
the bonds uniting the -two countries.
Another incident occurred in the
Avenue Dubois de Boulogne, when an
Individual shouted, "Long â¢ live an
archy!'* A squad of police immediately
pounced on the man and carried him
off \u25a0without confusion.
PARIS, May" 20.â The Petit Parisian
says that .whil e , King . Alfonso _and
President Loubet were driving along
the. AVcaue Dv bo Is de Boalogae to-day
a spectator burst through the line of
pollcej dodged the horses of the es
cort and brandished a dagger in the
face of the King, shouting "Down with
the inquisitors; long "live the work
ers." The : police succeeded in seizing
him, and at the police station he
eaid his name was Auguste Garnery.
He is 3S years of age. a jeweler's work
man and secretary of the Jewel Work
ers' Federation. Garnery has previously
had trouble with the police on ac
count of his revolutionary opinions.
The drive through the Avenue Du
bois de Boulogne, and the Champs
Elysse presented a brilliant spectacle.
Double lines of troops were stretched
from end to end of the avenues hold-
Ing back the cheering crowd. The
King graciously acknowledged the
ovation by waving his hand in a boy
ish manner. Everywhere the street
decorations were strikingly beauti
ful, with red and yellow flowers and
fiags symbolizing the colors of Spain.
! Loomis further explains that A. ! F. Jau
rett, then editor of the Venezuela Her
ald) and : semi-of ficlally attached to the
American legation, 1 was about to make a
loan to Mercado, but lacked $5000 of the
amount ! desired. Loomis ; lent him that
sum. He accepted as security from Jau
rett *a portion of the Mercado claim.'
.When Loomis af terwird .desired \u25a0 to
leave Venezuela for his annual vacation,
he sought to collect the money he had
loaned, and wrote. Russell the letter which
now figures in the .case.
CAI.L. BUREAU,: . POST -BUILDING;
WASHINGTON, ; May 3p.^Secre'tary Taft
returned to Washington this; morning and
resumed the \ investigation -of .the â¢ charges
against the \u25a0\u25a0. official; integrity} of '\u25a0Assistant-
Secretary of â¢ J State < â¢Loomis.' 7 " One 'of: the
most important' documentÃ. considered ; by
Taf t ; was ;, a ; : letter, written by Loomis. to
: W. W." B.usseli,, who: was .then secretary
of l the American Legation in Caracas.
\u25a0 This letter was found in the legation
by Bowen, when he:, succeeded . Loomis
there. It " was addressed . to "My Dear
Mr. Russeli,'/' and read: ."Regarding the
Malvlno Mercado claim that I- bought,
you may tell the - Venezuelan authorities
that I am willing to dispose of It for one
half of its-face value. Of this I want 30
per cent In cash and the rest in salt
bonds at eighty.. These bonds are now
quoted at eighty-six." _
Loomis has entered a detailed expla
nation of this letter, which, he says, was
in a box in the safe in the legation,
which â¢ Bowen opened, keeping the \ con
tents to use \ against him. Loomis ex
plains that the Govenynent of Spain sev
eral .years ago sold to Venezuela a tor
pedo boat' for 400,000 oolivars, and Vene
zuela ' gave ;as security for payment
1,000,000 bolivars' worth of Venezuela salt
bonds at par. When the 400.000 bolivars
had- been paid. for, the boat, according to
Loomis, it was decided, with the approval
of the State- Department in Washington,
that, the surplus of the 1,000,000 bolivars'
worth of salt bonds should , be handed
over to the American Minister in Caracas
and that he .'should pay with them cer
tain claims : against Venezuela which had
been adjudicated. : :
Loomis says this was done, and, that
160,000 bolivars in. salt bonds were i.-p'aid to
one Mercado, a promoter In .Venezuela;
that 60,000 bolivars in- salt bonds were
paid to the German railroad : ; for a sim
ilarly adjudicated claim: and that other
minor claims, were, satisfied. This was
simply a transaction for Venezuela by the
American Minister. ."".'I

dispatch from Vladivostok,, giving tlje
Emperor the, first "Russian- version of
the battle, much credit for! the victory
is given the mosquito craft of Togo's
fleet. / In fact, it is said that the tor
pedo attack alone was responsible for.

Admiral Rojestvensky's squadron; T<>
go sent a swarm of torpedo boats
against Nebogatoff. Numbers of them
were sunk, but the attacks were con
tinued and by- sheer, force of numbers
some of the small vessels succeeded
in reaching tho Russian ships and dis
charging, their torpedoes, in the face
of a- murderous fire, from the Russian
rapid fire guns. , ...
' While (this combat was raging, the
main squadron, commanded by Ad-;
miral'. Rojestvensky, f was attacked by
Admiral Togo and lost two ships. The
others-, broke through. Rojestvensky,
it is reported, then sent his fast light
cruisers ahead, the heavier I fighting
ships -remaining' behind. They were at
tacked by Vice Admiral Kamimura.

sources of; the naval battle fought in
the 'Straits of Korea came from Cap
tain". Chagin of the' cruiser Almaz, who
has".a;rrived at Vladivostok. He tele

Admiral Rojestvensky was , wounded. 1

pTOGO^^TACTICAL ADVANTAGES <
.;., Whatever "other information was con-
talnedin Captain Chagin's telegram was
withheld and no details are known except:
those contained in the. foreign dispatches!
Irbm which the naval officers have been;
able; to reconstruct a fair idea of the long
and. bloody sea fight. They figure that
Admiral Togro, with his main squadron,
must have lain somewhere off the coast
of Korea, while Admirals Kamimura and
Urlu held their sQuadrons farther north
to head off the Russian vessels which
might go through. and to bar the en
trance to the Straits of Tsugaru In case
the Russians should be reported moving
up the east coast of Japan. When Togo's
scouts reported that Admiral Rojestven
sky was heading for the eastern channel
of the Straits of Korea the Japanese ad
miral steamed around the northern part
of the Tsu Islands and came upon the
Russians steaming in double column with
the cruisers to port. Togo enjoyed the
great advantage of tactical position when
he opened fire, having the lightest of the
Russian ships between him and Rojes.t
vensky's heavier vessels, thus smothering
the fire of the latter. \u2666 Besides, Togo was
able to use air his broadsiders, "whereas
the sternmost ships of the Russian col
umns, coming on line-ahead formation,
could probably only with difficulty use
any guns at all.
Nevertheless, although suffering the
complete loss of four ships in the des
perate encounter which followed and be
ing subjected to a series of torpedo at
tacks on Saturday night, Rojestvensky
was able to steam 200 miles during the
night. ; ; ; \u25a0-.
When Sunday morning came the Rus
sian fleet was divided into two divisions.
The faster and stronger division, under
Rojestvensky, was met by Kamlmura and'
Urlu, while the slower division, under.
Nebogatoff, renewed the fight with "Togo.
With some of the scattered Russian units
it was a case of "save himself who cani"
CniPPLED SHIPS BROUGHT TO BAY.
In the running fight yesterday the Jap-!

speed, enabling them' to concentrate their,
fire and bring every crippled Russian ship
to bay. Admiral Nebogatott's~ 7 battered
remnant surrendered off Llancourt rocks,
while Rojestvensky, \ with* the best â¢* rp

ing that a Russian cruiser, had been
sighted off Askold Island, headed 'for
the harbor, the city was filled with the
wildest reports of every nature. "-' v
ALMAZ STEAMS IXTO PORT.
The inhabitants clustered in the
streets, thronged the water side or
climbed the frowning- hills overlooking
the harbor for a better view.
Finally, toward 6 o'clock of the
evening, a graceful cruiser with two
snowy white stacks shot into view at
the entrance to the Golden Horn and
rounded to an anchorage beneath the
bristling guns of the curving promon-.
tory. From afar the broken slump of
her- mlzienmast and a shot -hole show
ing black on the white paint of one
stack indicted that IJie cruiser had en
countered the Japanese.. As the anchor;
chain rattled, in the haw^eholcs the '
vessel wreathed itself in salute â it was
an admiral's salute in honor ,of Rear
Admiral yon Jessen. Scarcely had the
boom of the last cannon ' begun to
echo from the surrounding lillls when
Yon Jessen's flagship, the cruiser Ros
sia, answered the salute, and a minute
later the guns of the fortress took up
the cannonade.
Kxcltemen* beyond description seized
the ' thronging spectators, who with
frantic "huzzahs" tossed - high their
ctfps. Citizens embraced one another
and â¢ danced jubilantly on tho pier;
\u25a0while the crews of the ships In the
harbor Joined in wild cheering.
In a trice the boats were dropped
from the davits and in a moment the
officers of the cruisers and torpedo
boats in the^ harbor and the- military
officials from* the fortress were swarm
ing on board the Almaz to learn news
of the flgtiting.
GRAPHIC STORY OF BATTLE.
The story was short. According to
the ofHcers of the Almaz the fleet under
Rojestvensky met the Japanese in the
Straits of Korea, near Tsu Island, and
the opposing fleets immediately closed,
in. Being lightly armed, the Almaz, as
had been ordered by Admiral Rojest
vensky beforjt the battle, separated
hersftlf from .'the fleet at the first op
portunity and headed for Vladivostok
soon after the commencement of the
action, but not too soon to observe that
the losses on both sides in the titanic
combat were great.
Early in the battle an officer of; the
Almas, while watching Rojestvensky*s
flagship, the battleship Kniaz Souva
roff. for a signal, saw the flagship
shudder from stem to stern as if under
a blow from a gigantic hammer and
hesitate in her course, while tho" waves
rose high from her armored sides. :
Then she commenced to list and sink.
The officers believe that the debut of
the submarine -boat as an effective
agent In naval warfare, or perhaps a,
larce mine," caused', the disaster to ..'the
Kniaz Jouvnroff. The how
ever, was so extensive that the â¢ flugr
shlp soon went down, leaving the: deck
officers and many of the crew strug
gling In the waves. b'- â¢ â¢"â¢ \u25a0 ".
One of the Russian torpedo-boats,
either the destroyer Buiny or the^Bravi,
ran in and picked up a number of the
swimmers, one of whom was recognized
through a flash as Admiral Rojest
vensky.
Under a gruelling attack by the Jap
anese warships, aided by torpedo-boats,
mines and submarines, the Borodino
the Oslabya and the Orel were placed
out of action and followed the flagship
to the bottom.
SEE JAPANESE SHIPS SIXK.
The fog, which had raised and low
ered intermittently during the morn
ing, began to settle down again and
the distance of the Almaz, which had
now succeeded in disengaging herself
from the struggling ships, made it dif
ficult for her to see clearly, but the of
ficer* are positive that they saw two
Jaiiincxf battleships disappear beneath
the sea before tbelr eyes, and that two
Japanese cruisers appeared on the
point of ftlnkJnK.
The arrival of the Grozny at 11
o'clock to-day was marked by the
same scenes of excitement as those
which characterized the advent of the
Almaz.
A correspondent visited the wounded
commander of the destroyer. Captain
Andrlffski, at the hospital, and the cap
tain confirmed the details 'given by the
officers of the Almaz. He described his
combat as a running fight, in which
the Grozny was engaged for several
hours, finally sinking the pursuing Jap
anese destroyer. '

of the Navy, as follows:
"The main force of the Russians' sec
ond and third fleets is nearly annihilated.
Please feel assured of it."
The proverb that Togo always fights
and seldom reports is proving true in the
case of his greatest -battle. From the
briefest and most fragmentary reports
coming to Tokio it is impossible to gain
an approximate conception or picture of
the desperate and decisive combat. The
Navy Department, after announcing the
bare result yesterday, has lapsed into
silence again. It meets lnculrers with
the statement that the department is not
interested in the publication of news, but
is concerned only in gaining victory for
Japan.
It Is probable that many details of the
fight will never be given to the world.
Days and weeks may elapse before the
main facts of the battle and its strategy
are made known.
Admiral Togo appears to have planned
and laid a complete trap which fitted Ad
miral Rojestvensky's action and the Jap
anese outrcaneuvered, outfought and out
shot the Russians, fearlessly taking their
lightest cruisers against the heavy Rus
sian ironclad battleships and armored
cruiser^ and smothering them with gun
fire.
Tremendous interest attaches to the use
of t submarine 0 vessels. The Navy Depart
ment is silent on this point, but It is con
fidently believed that submarines were
effectively used for the first time in his
tory.
Theroetically the sea was too rough
for the employment of submarines on
Saturday, but the Japanese sailors wel
come desperate chances. It is believed
that torpedo-boats and destroyers scored
heavily on Saturday night.
The conditions on Sunday were most
favorable. The night was calm and
clear and land was visible for forty
miles across the Tsu Straits.

MONTROSE. Colo.. May 30.â A cave-In
occurred to-day in the Gunnlson tunnel,
one of the large Irrigation projects of the
United States Government, entombing a
number of workmen, variously estimated
at from twenty to twenty-five. It is not
likely that any of the men are dead, un
less they were caught and crushed to
death by the falling earth, for the air
pipes running into the tunnel have been
working almost without interruption since
the accident happened at ID o'clock this
morning. . :* 1 .
By order of Resident Engineer McCon
nellall work on the tunnel has been sus
pended and the entire forces of men and
machinery have been brought to the scene
of the cave-in to aid in rescuing the en
tombed men. No headway can be made
in the tunnel for the "reason that new
breaks in the roof, occur as fast
as the debris Is removed. A shaft
Is being sunk directly over the spot where
the men are burled and machinery Is in
place to remove the dirt and rock as
fast as it can be dug or blown out. The
shaft must penetrate sixty-five feet before
the tunnel can be reached and it is not
thought the distance can be covered be
fore to-morrow noon. ThÂ© cave-In oc
curred beneath the bed of Cedae Creek
and was primarily due to the softened
earth caused by seepage from tne creek.

j Â« t WASHINGTON;May 30. â "Until some
word of peace comes out of Tsarskoe-
Selo, Nippon has but to fight on." \u25a0 .
This epigrammatic remark of Taka
hira, the Japanese Minister, made to
night with the details of*the victory 'of
the Japanese fleet before him," accur
ately sets forth ;not only his opinion,
but. it is believed, that of Washing
ton and other neutral Governments
represented here regarding the effect
of the battle on. Russia's policy.
Whether Count Casslni, the Russian
Embassador, will be the bearer of that ;
fateful word when he sees the Presi
dent to-morrow or Thursday remains
to be seen, but the Embassador in a
conversation to-night was more em
phatic than at any time since the
war begun in declaring 1 that it would
go-On indefinitely. While admitting
that he would see the President in the
next .few days and have a long- confer
ence on the general situation, the Em
bassador strongly discouraged any
hopes of an early peace.
"Perhaps after Llaoyang there was
a possibility of peace. I will not say
there was not an Idea of peace at that
time in certain quarters; . . but â¢ now,
nfter thin rrunhlnsr defeat, never!* The
Japanese j talk of \ Indemnity. Russia
can better une thin money la the
building of another fleet. Certainly
this Is not the time when BnsMia can
afford to take ;np â¢ the question of
peace."
I It is this apparent determination of
Russia to continue in the face of dis
astrous defeats on land and sea which
discourages the Washington Government
at this time from taking any positive^
steps toward offering assistance to the
belligerents In coming to an understand
ing. It is believed here, however, that
when Russia, through her own agents,
has learned the full extent of her losses, j
she may be approached regarding peace
with some hope that overtures will be
welcomed. ;It is such an .opportunity for
which this Government is watching. Â§
Soon after, the President returned from
New York this evening Secretary Taft,
who had been out of the city for about
a week, called at the .White House and {
was In conference with', him for "several |
hours. While the Secretary . was there 1
dispatches arrived from the Japanese le
gation giving details of the battle, which I
the President read with ; keen interest.
The President and Secretary discussed a
number of matters, but the outlook for
peace, occupied much of their time. ' It Is
realized that the crushing character Â« of j
the Russian defeat gives to the President
an "opportunity -with entire propriety to
offer his services to the St. Petersburg
Government in establishing communica- i
tion with Tokio, but ; until it ' can; be j
learned that such an offer probably would j
be successful, this Government is: not I
Inclined to 'act. - /
Throughout the diplomatic corps to-day
tlfe keenest interest Y was taken in~; the
news of the conference with , Takahlra; 1
the Japanese Minister, had with the Pres- 1
Ident at the White House last night." j ;
There are endless accounts of individual
herojsm, but none more thrilling than
that of a young sailor who gave up his
place on'a piece of plank in order that he
might save the life of a lieutenant of the
Alexander I. who had been a popular
officer with his crew and who was ill at
the time of the attack. The sailor was
afterward rescued by a passing boat, but
later died from exposure, as did so many
of his comrades.
The men are in desperate straits. The
boats in which they sought refuge when
their ships went down were badly .pro
visioned and in most cases not all, so
that the terrors of the heavy seas were
added to by pangs of hunger and thirst.
The survivors state they had absolutely
no chance of winning. The attack of the
Japanese was so sudden and complete
and the plan of attack so different from
what was expected that the entire fleet
became panic stricken. The long range
fire of the enemy was so deadly that there
was no chance of replying, because the
Japanese had chosen their own range,
which no Russian ship could equal.
Then came the torpedo-boat attack,
which completed the demoralization. They
say the crews took to the water in most
cases before the torpedoes had gone home
and those who remained on board their
vessels were precipitated into the sea by
the explosions that followed. Many saved
themselves by clinging to pieces of
wreckage.
KOBE, May 30.â T0-day the survivors
of the great fight were beginning to ar
rive along the Japanese coast, clinging
to the wreckage or carried by the few
boats which escaped from the battle. A
disabled Russian cruiser carrying 200 offi
cers and men approached Hamadi, which
is on the mainland of Japan and opposite
the scene of the battle. She flew a white
flag, and a,s soon as she was sighted a
Government boat was dispatched to es
cort her ashore and offer the survivors
a ready welcome. The officials of the
Japanese Red Cross Society went out in
a launch and gave such aid as they could
to the wounded and carried them to tem
porary quarters near Yamaguchi, which
Is at the southwest of the Island of Nip
pon and the land nearest to where the
battle was fought.
The waters are alive with Russian sea
men, who are desperately striving to
make the land in small boats, or clinging
to the mass of wreckage. Small mer
chantmen and pleasure ships have gone
out to pick up all the survivors they can
find. They have already rescued several
hundred men, many of whom are
wounded. All are in a state of extreme
exhaustion.

"It was submarines that ilid the
work," said White to-day. "They were
sent there for the purpose. If there
are any Runs Inn warships left all the
Japanese have to do Is to round them
up, keep at n safe distance and let the
submarines finish them. If this course
is pursued there wont be a Russian
flax floating on a warship on the. seas
of the Orient."
Admiral Togo, White says, attached
them to his fleet and placed upon them
his chief dependence in destroying the
squadron of Rojestvensky.
White said to-day that these myster
ious packages contained *ffNf *; Heljand
submarines . for the j Japanese"* Govern
ment. They were accompanied to To
klo by a corps of skilled ; American
engineers and mechanics employed at
high salaries, not only to put the boats
together at a.'; secret Japanese ship
yard, but to operate them In the naval
battle.'" -White says that the boats were
launched on May 10, . and that they
proved more than satisfactory in their
trial tests. They were equipped with
improved torpedo tubes and also with
searchlights for use when moving be
neath the surface.
JERSEY CITY, N. J., May 30.â
George 11. 'White, who was associated
with John P. Holland In the construc
tion of four submarine boats, which
were built In Jersey City, says these
boats wrecked the Russian fleet.
It will be recalled that there was
considerable excitement over the ship
ment of machinery for Japan that
went over the Northern Pacific rail
road last spring. There were rumors
that Russia's spies "had attempted to
blow up the train containing this con
signment.
It is impossible to determine the par
ticular manner of the destruction of
the individual Russian ships. It is re
ported that submarine vessels and
specially .laid mines were used, but a
satisfactory confirmation of this is not
obtainable.
Captain Roshinoff reached a dam
aged steam launch and was picked up
on Sunday. The other survivors used
life belts and were rescued by fisher
men.
TOKIO, May 30. â Captain Roshinoff,

Foreign observers sharply criticize Ad

Nebogatoff, despite the mcagerness of the
knowledge of the details and conditions
which governed them. Admiral Rojest

co-operation with the Vladivostok squad
ron and his battle formation, which
placed all the strong ships on the star

ACCIDENT TO GRAVEL
CAE DELAYS TRAFFIC
SACRAMEXTO. May SO.â E. J. Smith,
the defaulting tax collector of San Frah
clsco, was placed in the penitentiary
at Folsom to-night, to begin his ten
year sentence. He was given a "receiv
ing suit," which bore little resemblance
to the jaun'.y, tailor-made garb he wore
when he reached Sacramento at noon, ten
route to the prison. He stepped out' of
the private compartment In the Overland
Limited, which is made up exclusively
of parlor car passengers, and as 'â¢â¢he
walked along with a small grip in his
hand, he looked more- like a well-to-do
tourist than a convict. Even the sheriff's
deputies, who accompanied him, seemed
to be impressed with the idea that they
were the traveling companions of a dis
tinguished Individual, rather than' his
keepers. They accompanied him to"- the
depot grill, where Smith ate a hearty
luncheon.
A newspaper man approached him and
asked him if he had a pleasant Journey
from San Francisco. "Oh, yes," replied
Smith, "I enjoyed my trip to-day, <but I
think I shall enjoy the return trip more.
Do you know, I do not realize yet where
I am going, but one thing is certain,
when I do reach my destination news
paper reporters will trouble me no more.
Now." added Smith grandly, "you run
along and leave me alone." l Â»'
Smith continued to give his directions
for the last meal he will order from a
menu card for a long time. t
Smith was obliged to divest himself of
his fine clothes at the prison for one of
the several "receiving suits" . that, are
kept there to accommodate the /new
comers until theyi are duly j fitted to
stripes. To-morrow he will be measured
by the Bertlllon system, his hair will be
cropped and he will be accommodated to
a convict suit that meanwhile will be se
lected for him.
Warden Yell said to-night that Smith
would be treated in all respects like an
ordinary prisoner. ' He said . there -Is a
rule at the prison against permitting a
convict to be specially photographed or
otherwise singled out , for treatment not
accorded his fellow prisoners, -and -that
this rule would be enforced st/ictly with
respect to Smith. â¢ â¢ \u25a0> '\u25a0 *
"When a man comes here," said the
Warden, "he loses - his former identity.
He becomes a number, that's all. I shall
treat Smith as I treat any ordinary pris
oner.' They are ali-on an equality here."
In a few days Smith's photograph will
Tie prepared and be sent to the various
Chiefs of Police and Sheriffs according to
custom. :~-"J"

Defaulter Enter* Hack Provided for
Htm With Grin on His Face.
.With a Joke on his lips Edward :J.
Smith, the defaulting Tax Collector, wis
taken from the County Jail yesterday
morning -to begin his journey to Folso&a,
where he must serve a ten-year sentence.
In the face of the punishment that the
law has meted out to him -the thieving
official' wasc as gay as on the night
when he had the last carouse with Leona
Brooks. '. * <<*:"
He Jested with Chief. Jailer Coyle and
as he. walked into the street to the hack
with Deputy- Sheriff Thomas Wheelan he
laughed as though all /his troubles were
over. v" V-;
"The prize animal -is, going to leave
them," he said. He was taken to Folsom
on a limited train. The defaulting Tax
Collector . was not handcuffed, but was
treated with the same extraordinary con
sideration that was shown him by the
police. i
Smith conducted himself throughout as
though he was still | the successful poli
tician.- Self -admitted thief though he was
he attempted to assume the attitude Jof
one who had failed in the manipulation
of money that was his own. "I feel fine
this mornine," he said.
Once a shadow crossed the criminal's
face. It was when he thought of the
home he had blasted. He held' a short
whispered conversation with his friend
R. E. Dunn. To this man It is believed
that he entrusted his last message "to
his invalid wife and his child on Fair
Oaks street. ;
Smith goes to the penitentiary alone,
though Foreman Andrews and other
members of the Grand Jury are certain
that he was only one of a ring. T"he
Grand Jury Investigations will be re
sumed to-day and Andrews declares that
he and his fellow jurors will leave jno
stone unturned until Smith's co-conspir
ators are behind .the bars with him.

ASTORIA. May SO.â Three young per
6ons met violent deaths "in or near As

one was killed by a falling tree.
The drowniiis accident was unusually
sad. A- party of young persons, among
them Sirs. Ann Seabors:. her daughter
Am. her son George, Robert Broom and
* Mr. and Mrs. Martin Olsen went to
Greenwood Cemetery In a pleasure boat
to decorate the graves of friends. On
the. return the boat was struck by a
. sweU In Young's Bay. Miss Seaborg was
thrown overboard. Broom Jumped after
her, but no sooner reached her than both
disappeared and did not again come to
the surface. The young woman was 21
'years old and Broom 23 years old.
Frank Clapshaw, who was falling tim
ber" near her, was .struck on the head by
; a< timber. . His skull was crushed.
Judge H.H. Pierce of Los Angeles, fa
miliarly : known' in the southern part of
the State a3 the "Marrying Justice," and
his bride of a few days are among tTie
latest arrivals at the Palace Hotel. TSe
bridal couple came north Monday and ex
pect to leave to-day for ; Portland, where
they will visit the Lewis and Clark , Ex
position and later extend their, honey
moon trip through the Northwest.
The aged jurist, ; who is ' many years
older than his bride, was quietly married
to Miss . Nellie May Allie . in Los Angeles
last Wednesday and ; immediately v: after
the wedding ceremony the happy, couple
started for this city, making;; stops "at
Santa* Barbara and "San Jose. .His mar
riagewas-a surprise-to the * majority' of
the Judge's friends, who were inclined
to believe that he was contented with
marrying others, a duty, he has per
formed for years in .the .south and in
which .he. made a record.'
In the absence of h.er husband yester
day. Mrs. Pierce declined; to : discuss her
matrimonial affairs as she courteously
remarked with a smile, "There is nothing
strange about the affair. We, have been
married and that is all there is about it"
si'Yes.i'l'm married,", Vsaid the Judge a
little later, "and .we are now on our hon
eymoon.: We're: going to; Portland^ and
will return . to Los Angeles when we feel
so disposed." And a broad smile.illumi
nated his usually stern \ countenance as
he bade adieu to his interviewer and pro
ceeded to ''join the lonely \u25a0'. Mrs. Pierce,
who was impatiently awaiting his return.
During his many years' experience 'as
a marrying Justice in Los Angeles Judge
Pierce stubbornly- refused : to . demand of
brides a promise to ;"obey" when per
forming the marriage ceremony. At his
own wedding last Wednesday, at which
Rev. Hugh K. Walker ; officiated, tne
pledge was exacted from his bride, how
ever, before the . happy groom realized
that a departure had been made from his
own form of nuptial ceremony. But this
fact has -in no way-? marreU ' the honey
moon of the Judge and his young bride,
as is evidenced in their noticeable con
tentment.

man of the day, began his introductory
remarks to the throng that had gathered
around the stand in the . cemetery.' Gen
eral Coolldge spoke of the heroic deeds
done on the various bloody battle fields
of the Civil .War by those ,who lay sleep
ing in . the v many g national cemeteries
throughout the country, and said it was
a yearly work of : love to honor their
memory by tenderly depositing blossoms
on their graves: lie spoke in kindliness
of the brave . soldiers -in ' gray who j had
opposed the army" of the republic, and
said' that in the" Spanish-American war,
the, youth' who had carried the stars and
stripes to victory on land and sea had
sprung from both Union and Confederate
ancestors. ; X
The j parade that formed on . Lombard
street and marched to the cemetery was
imposing. Grand Army posts, â¢ National
Guard companies, blocks of-- artillery,
regular infantry and cavalry and bands
and citizens In carriages, including vet
erans too old to march, moved in pro
cession through the wooded : ways of the
Presidio to the green slope dotted with
the white stones. -On the platform there
gathered Grand Army and other notables,
including" Brigadier General : Funston,
commander of the Department of Cali
fornia. .A programme of unusual excel
lence was. carried .out and few of- the
throng departed before it was over. One
of . the features was the singing of a
chorus of school children whose tender
voices -rose in unison In the "Ode to the
Nation's Dead.'.' They were from the
Clement Grammar School, and were led
by Miss Esther ,Sirams. The -California
quartet, composed" of C.L. Goetting, C.
L. Gage. W. E. Smith and C. L. . Parent,
rendered "Blest Be the Ground" and "To
Thee, O Country."
PASTOR SPEAKS FOR PEACE.
At the Presidio National Cemetery a
small flag fluttered against every white
stone that marked the grave of a pa
triot gone, and garlands lay all- about on
the green lawn above the sleeping ones
who had "worn the army. blue.-i I From an,
early hour people began* flocking to the'
military necropojis bearing blossoms as
their tributes of affection to those who
ihad carried armjs that, their country
'might survive In the full freedom given
[It; by its forefathers and bring the boon
of liberty to others that were oppressed.'
Over the wooded inclines of th 6 reser
vation floated " the strains of me
morial music and the measured
boom of . guns was heard on
the slopes arid far down Into the city and
out on the waters of the bay. The dead
slept on, unconscious" that their deeds had
brought thousands :in to the
spot ,where all that was mortal of 'them
had been laid to rest.

he said: '

Comrade Irwin earnestly urged that
a memorial building for the Grand
Army be erected in this city. He said
the history of the posts and the rec
ords of the valorous deeds of their
members should be preserved among
the archives of the high schools that
for all the years to come the pupils
Might Lave them before them.
Tho speaker exhorted the Grand
Army men to get closer together. The
bonds that held thorn as' comrades
should tighten every year, he said. He
declared that all citizens who were en
joying the bencflts of the greatest re
public on earth should miss no oppor
tunity to assist the living among the
veterans, as well as to commemorate
tbÂ« deeds of those who had gone. It
was better to even pJn a rofce on a
Grand Army man's lapel than to erect
a monument over his grave, he said.
Chaplain Jrwln closed with a touch
ing peroration, saying that the veterans
â¢ Trho had gone and those who yet re
mained to be called would never pass
from the memory of tlie living and that
the day on which the blossoms were
lovingly strewn upon the soldiers'
graves would grow more sanctified as
each succeeding year went by.'

scatter them abroad In honor of the
brave Union soldiers who had died for
her country ana paid that this showed the
influence of Memorial day extended to the
remote corners of the earth. Not only on
tha hillsides, which are aglow with them,
bad the people of San Francisco been
plucking c blossoms, but from the hill
eides of patriotism they had been gather
ing .them until they hid a vast treasure
of love and pride to lay at the feet of the
departed ones.
The Grand Army was the finest body
of aged men on earth, the speaker said.
The members' needed no encomiums
from human lips. Their deeds were
sufficient to cause Ihem to lire in glo
rious memory forever. He was glad
there were so many left after the two
score years that had passed since the
bloody strife apd he marveled that
there were so many. - \u25a0
The orator lightened his address
with Just a few touches of humor that
served the good purpose pf lightening
the somberness that is usual with such
gatherings. He prals<Â»d -San, Francisco
and said -of it: "It sits on more hills
than Rome â and As a better city." The
audience laughed at this, and it
laughed again" when he^aid: c c

that there will ever be a State that has
more local pride than Kansas. One day
a teacher asked In one of the public
schools there who discovered America.
It was about the time of- the capture of

pave trirth to a resolve by all who came
after nwef to allow the 'glory they had
spread around the stars and stripes to

AX EXAMPLE TO EMULATES.
Tou bad. in the first place, the right spirit,
and then you had the quality of making that
(spirit evident in the time of ' need. If. you
had not bad cat riot Ism. devotion to the coun-
Mucn. very much, has been done. In this
country by education. No one can overstate
the deLt that this country Is under to the ed
ucntnrs: but In taking advantage of all the
improved methods, let us not forget that there
aro certain qualities which are not new,
which are eternal because they are eternally
true, and the ' failure to develop which will
caupo a lorn which cannot be offset by any
merely Intellectual and mental gain. . A sound
body is a first-class thlmr, a sound mind Is an
pv.n better thing, but the thing that counts
for most in the Individual as in. the nation is
character, the sum of those qualities ' which
make a man a good man and' a woman .Â»
-ood ivnmiin.
And you men of the Civil War, you men to
whom tMs country 'owes- mire than to any
others, r.o matter h^w great the services of
those others may. be, because to you this coun
try owÂ«Â» its life; you won the place you did,
yc-ti won for- this country Its salvation, be
cause you had In you those qualities which. ln
their aggregate we know by the name of char
acter: the qualities , which made : you to , put
material â¢ guns; material well-being,'^ not
merely below, but. Into insignificance as com
pared " to tbinps that were greater, when "â¢ the
crises called fnr showing your manhood; , You
went to th<Â» war. â¢: leaving â¢ those behind \u25a0> who
could mafce more money, who could rise In the
world, but carrying, with you In your hearts
the honor and the future of a mighty nation.'
And General Slocum did his first great pub
lic eervlce when the crisis called not primarily
for the softer and milder, but 'for the sterner
and hardir virtues; and we cannot afford In
this day cf material luxury, in this day when
civilization tends to make life easy, we cannot
afford to lenore those hard and stern \-lrtues.
In the work of the day in the world as It" Is,
not only In war, but in private life and in
public life alike, a man has to -have the
strength of fiber or he cannot put Into | effect
even the bei-t of his efforts, and he cannot
afford to let the generation that Is coming up
grow up with the feeling that any quality
will perve as a substitute for the old and es
sential quality of manliness In a man and
womanliness in a woman.
The surest war for a nation to Invite
disaster is to be opulent, agranressive
and unarmed. Xow we are opulent
and T hope we will remain mo. 1 trust
that we shall never be aggressive un
less ngrgression 1% not . merely - Jus
tified but demanded . either by our
own self- respect,- or ! by the Inter
ests of mankind. Finally, remember
that to be aggressive, above . all, to be
aggressive In speech and not be armed,
Invites not merely disaster, but tbe
conteiKiit of mankind.
Brooklyn not only furnished valiant soldiers
to the Civil War, but It furnished In times of
peace a most excellent Secretary of the Navy
to the United States (pointing to General
Tracy upon the platform). If our navy is good
enough we have a. long career of peace before
us. and the only likelihood of trouble ever
coming to us as a nation will arise If we let
our navy become too small or inefficient. A
first-class navy, first class In point of size.
above all first class in point of efficiency of
the Individual units acting as units and. in
combination. Is the surest and cheapest guar
antee of peace; and I should think that any
man looking at what is happening and what
has happened abroad and In our own history
during the past ; few years must be indeed
blind if he cannot read that lesson clearly. '
NEED OF CHARACTER^
I will put It fttronser than thatâ lt
in absolutely essential that this nation,
If it is to hold the position in the future
that it ha* held In the past, must act
not only within but without its own
borders in a spirit of Justice and of
larfre generosity toward all other peo
ples.
We owe an obligation to ourselves. \u25a0 we
owe those obligations to all mankind. More
and more as we increase in strength I hope
tv see a corresponding Increase in the eober
sense of responsibility ! which shall prevent
us either Injuring or insulting any other peo
ple. You may notice that 1 1 said "insulting"
as well as "Injuring." If there is one. quality
sometimes shown among us which Is not com
mendable it is a' habit of speaking: loosely
about foreign powers, foreign races. You do
not need any of you to be told that Mn pri
vate life you will resent an, insult quite as
much as an injury and our public writer*
need to steadily keep before their minds the
thought that no possible good can- come to
us by speaking offensively of any one else
and trouble may come.
That is one side.' The other side is that
no amount of good Intention, no amount' of
sweetness in life, no amount of appreciation
of decency avails In the least In the rough
work of the world as we find It unless back
of the honesty of purpose, back of the decency
of life and thought, lies the power that makes
a man a man. It Is true of the individual
and it is true of the nation. It Is In the last
decree desirable.
Xow I want all ycu people to remember that
two sides of the lesson Is taught by General
Siocum's life. A successful war for unright
eousness is the most dreadful of all things;
It Is the thing that gets back more than aught
else the course of civilization. But no people
worth preserving ever existed nor will exist
that was not able to fight if the need arose,
and so with the Individual. The man who
possesses great ability and great courage un
accompanied by the moral sense, a courage
and ability ungulded by the stern purpose to
do what is Just and upright, that man is
rendered by the fact of having the courage
and' the ability .cnly.so much the greater
menace to the community In which he un
fortunately dwells.
We cannot afford as a people e\-er to for
get for one moment that ability, far-sighted
ness. Iron resolution, perseverance, willingness
to do and dare, are qualities to be admired
only If they are put at the service of the
right, at the service of decency and Justice.
The man who possesses those qualities and
dues not shape his course by a fundamental
and unwavering moral principle Is a menace
to each and all of us; and thrice foolish,
thrice wicked is the other man who condones
his moral shortcomings because of his intel
lectual or physical strength and prowess.
TO BE ARMED A.\D AMIABLE.
Surely there Is need for me to say but
little in emphasis of what has been set forth
befor* I began to speak as to the prime sig
nificance -of General Slocum's career. He was
a great soldier, a most gallant and able com
mander. Once the war was over, he turned
as whol^-heartedly to the pursuits . of peace
as he had during. the war turned to the strife
of arms. He was one of those men on whose
car*Â«r we can dwell In Its entirety. We don't
have to dwell wli.h emphasis on part of It be
cause we do not care to speak of another part.
We are able to point to General Slocum as
tiiat type- of what a decent . American citizen
should be. an a man who was an example In
his family life, an example in his business
rt-latiur.s, honest and upright public servant
no less than a fearless and able soldier.
late them upon the good fortune of having the

served the people so well as to make it their

erect the statue that It might serve as a les

men, -the men who forty years ago were fight

of love upon the . tombs of those who ; have
gone before, making no distinction nor differ
ence, but laying the wreaths equally upon the
graves of Union and Confederate soldiers, a
tribute : of love from the living to the dead.
Oh, think of 1C my friends, and let there
spring up In your mind a sense of the grrand

DEMONSTRATION BY PEOPLE.
The President was in New York City
five hoars, but during that time did not
' pat his foot In Manhattan, passing
eroynd the island in a ferry boat to the*
Brooklyn Bide of East River, and after
the exercises returning lnÂ° th* same
fashion. The entire trip was without un-,
happy Incident.
i The President arrived in jersey City- at"
7:os a. m., and was met by a committee
headed by Frederick H. Cunnison ef the
Union League Club. W. E. Pulitzer and
ex-Mayor Charles A. Schleren'of Brook
lyn. He traveled in a special car at
tached to a regular express on the Penn
sylvania railroad. The President was ac
companied only by Secretary Loeb and
Dr. Stokes.
The party immediately boarded a ferry
boat and was landed at the foot of Fulton
street. Brooklyn. There the party was
met by. Troop C. and escorted to the"
Union League ; Club xooms. Along the
route flags were flying and thousands of
people lined the streets. Mr. Roosevelt
was constantly acknowledging the en
thusiastic reception tendered him. Thou
sands of people were .in waiting at the
club, but they had only a glimpse of the
President.
Brtakfast was served to a party of 100,
efter which there was a brief reception.
On leaving the* Union League Club the
President proceeded between cheering
lines ot people to the plaza, where the
crtat bronze statue of General Slocum by
Mitc-MonnJes was to be unveiled. Two
**.<at stands facing , the statue were
tilJed with people. The arrival of' the
Presidential party was signaled by the
firing of a salute of twenty-one guns.
Mayor McClellan greeted the President
cordiajly, and the multitude gave him an
ovatipn.
, CiJEXEUAL, SICKLES CHEERED.
The crowas burst into cheers as Gen
eral Daniel E. SJckles, who fought with
General Slocum, walked on crutches,
toward the unveiling platform. Th? gen
eral had to be lifted almost bodily up thÂ»
steps.
The exercises at the unveiling began
with an invocation by the Right Rev.
Bishop Frederick Burgess, Episcopal
Bishop of ' Long Island:*
The statue of General Slocum was un
veiled by Miss Gertrude Slocum, the 17
year-old granddaughter of General Slo
cum. amid the cheers" of thousands. A
Falute of thirteen guns was fired as Miss
Slocum drew aside the flags which veiled
the statue.
. In accepting the statue Mayor Mc-
Clellan made reference to President
Roosevelt's own service as a soldier, and
said that it was fitting that the Chief
Magistrate of the country, "himself a
gallant ..soldier, should be present at the
unveiling, of a statue to one of the na
tion's greatest \u25a0 heroes."
The crowds rose and stood bareheaded
while the band played "The Star-Span
jgled Banner." after the Maypr had con
cluded his speech. As Jhe last note, of the
hymn' died .away, the President began
his address." He spoke for about thirty
minutes. He said:
SPEECH OF PRESIDENT.
Mr. Mayor. Mr. Commissioner and you, my
Xtilow-citizens. and above all. you who took
paj-t :n the great war In which the man whose
*t*tue, Js raised s to-day won for himself and
his country renown and* honor: Day before
jt-sterday I listened to a sermon in which the
preacher, dwelling upon the exercises to be
held throughout the Union to-day, preached on
the text which commemorates th-e altar raided
by command of Mones to commemorate the
victory gained by the children of Israel over
the wild tribes of the desert, who -sought to
liar th^lr march toward the promised land,
wherein Am&lek came out of Israel, fought
all day while" Aaron and Hur upheld the hands
of M'ses until as night fell the sun went down
on the Israelites and raised an altar to
Jehovah, who etood as thÂ» exponent of the
principle for which Israel warred. They raised
it \u25a0to the principle ot righteousness, which
S-lont can justify any war or any struggle,
end. Mr. Mayer, that Is the thought that you
'developed in the excellent address to which
we h*ve Just listened, that we make to-day
cerr.mcir.orate the preat victory, the triumph of
the cause of Union and Liberty: not primarily
because It was a victory, but because It was
a victory for righteousness and the peace and
the hbfrty and the eternal spiritual welfare
of mankind.
I rcc before me men here Tvho iron
lii^li honor as comrades In arms of
General Slocum, and I knorr that there
esjMts In the Union no mra who will
appreciate more the fact that now,
forty years after the war, the eroTvnlnsr
triumph of vrhnt they did is to hcfmnnl j
In the fact that we Imve n cmuiiirly '

the mÂ«n r.ito wore tbe blue Mtrctclies

and fellow countryman, tbe man who

patriotism and your devotion .to j the flag ; had
not been backed up by a willingness to stay

of the two great crises of: the nation" s history,
the great crisis In which the nation, was born
In the days of 1770 and the no less great crtsia
In which the nation was saved : by the men

and should the need' ever^arlse, â¢ In war, also,
the qualities â¢ that' you showed, the qualities
that make it now the plearantest of all tasks
for a public servant, who appreciates the
greatness of America, to come on an occa
sion like this and see the people of a great
city dedicate a monument In honor of a great
citizen, who. at every point of his career, illus
trated what the name American should be
when It Is used In the sense of the highest.
Its deepest and its beat significance.
After the address Bishop McDonald
delivered the benediction and the Pres
ident and party" walked across the
street to the reviewing: stand. There
the President, the Mayor and officials
reviewed the . Grand Army parade and
then the President made a hurried dash
to the naval Y. M. C. A. ; .
A rapid Inspection of the building;
the gift of Miss Helen Gould, was made
and then the President delivered a
twenty minutes' address. The Presi
dent said in part: â¢ â¢ : \u25a0
Officers and enlisted men of the United
States Navy and you, friends of tha nayy â
for if you are good Americans you" are nothing
else â I made up my mind to-day, though many
Invitations were extended to me, that I could
not refuse to come to this building and meet
you here. I don't have to tell you that I be
lieve with all my heart in the navy of the
United States, and I believe In what counts
most in this nayy â the officers and enlisted
men, the man behind the gun, the man In the
engine room, the man In the conning tower, the
man. wherever he Is. who Is doing his duty.
Too much cannot be said to Impress on you
the all-Important work you are doing. Even
if you â¢ never go Into battle you create a
spirit that makes those coming after you feel
able to do their duty. The time of peace
Is the time to make ready for war. I "do not
think we will have any war if we have a good
enough navy. Every first-class record you
make at target practice is a positive provoca
tion to peace. . : * \u25a0 â¢ <

LTTERATURE OF THE JAPANESE
The Japanese' are serious minded peo
ple,, as their, literary' habits show, says
the Philadelphia; Ledger.* ; They take life
seriously and j devote their time to the
reading ' of what- would: be called in
America ; solid books.' The recent report
of the" iibfafian of the -imperial, library
lit Tokio ' shows ,that > there isÂ» little de
mand for light literature* in that capital,
for fiction of any.sbrt, contrary: to the
experience of most of the; popular libra
ries; in } England, X] France and -America.
\u25a0^he. Japanese mind runs to science,
mathematics, medicine, language, and %to
whatVmay be termed, the ..graver -forms
of literature. More than . 40 .per. cent r of
the " i works . taken i out - of . the ; imperial
library are of this character. The uJapa
nese are very fond '-* of - history, in the
making _of _. which they are extensively
engaged j at ". present ; in ; : the r Eastern â¢' war.'

of ah J '^ppeal to icnarfs'. instinctive fear. ; Their plan was to bring
men together, sharply arrest their attention, fix their minds upon
issues of the gravest import, and distinctly discourage all critical
thought. Under these conditions men's actions "will > be reflex and
impulsive rather than deliberative," and the waves of -emotion of
either fear or joy will sweep the audience.' The hypnotic method
consists in inducing impulsive self-surrender rather than delibera r
tive devotion. There is a suggestion "of theimpotence of the hu
man will, and of the power that comes through complete surrender."
Davenport condemns this because its tendency is not to strengthen
the intellect and the will, but to submerge both under the billows of
suggestion and emotion. In the new evangelism he thinks there will
be less appeal to fear, not so much will be said of the soul's deprav
ity, and more of its infinite worth.
Aside from the curious interest of this analysis. by a. preacher
aud sociologist, there is much of wisdom," for by strenuously work
ing on the emotion of fear, perhaps more harm may be done to. the
sensitive innocent than good to the hardened wicked. There is a
story told of a preacher who had such a talent for vivid description
that when he once talked to a congregation about a terrible thun
derstorm an old lady in the audience put up her umbrella. If such
an exhortcr had exerted himself eloquently about hell-fire he might
have hypnotically made many in the crowd suffer as needlessly as
was the spreading of the umbrella. ,

THE prevailing indifference to fire losses sustained by the coun
try isÂ° a curious commentary on American commercialism. The
.returns show that- last year these iosses amounted to the colos
sal total of over $252,364,000, and the gravity of these statistics is
/intensified by the fact that nearly 7000 lives were -sacrificed. Loss
by fire is of course complete and absolute and it is a loss that must
necessarily be' distributed indirectly over the whole â¢ nation. An es
timate of the titter destruction of property thus caused during a
number ' of " years would confront us with a material loss of which
the magnitude would-be almost inconceivable and by: the extent
e of that loss the nation as a whole is the poorer.
c Sari . Francisco in hex; early - : ; days :had^ sufficiently ste/rn lessons,
in' the devastating power of/fire: and for that experience she; paid
ihe full price. :( During the -six great /conflagrations that|po^n*feft in;
the course -of about half that number ;of; years the? loss .to" the .city
amounted to over $20,000,000. It was certainly ; a heavy cost, but
it niay perhaps fo -doubted if the; lesson ha&been; learned with .the
finality and the completeness" that its Vital; importance 1 deserves. V If
San Francisco no longer â¢ sleep; tinker; the shadow of such dire ca
tastrophes, and; -^ may confidently ; believe -that this is irideed^sb,
her immunity is due: more -to; the efficiency^ and; ;the^ devotion of
her fire brigades than '{'id. the 1 prevention ithati is : '; always so much
better than "the cureJ %It is not enough; to promptly, extinguish fires
when they Ofcs^M^t^^y^yetu^f^liz^ that the experts speak
the words of truth and soberness when they tell us:: that the great
majority of these fires; that occurjcpuld be, and ought Jto be, pre
vented.
If it be indeed true^ that; these annual losses by^.firei are largely
preventable it is a 'matter that should ; arouse the; practical interest
of every sane commercial mind in the country. Her
struction of property is a national concern because all wealth in its

If a woman of. GO is really young, enough
to look 45, why should she be obliged to
confess to 60? ' ' â¢ t " ."'\u25a0". \u25a0'\u25a0.
She is dot ashamed. She. is simply en
lightened. She has "caught on" to the
principle of being young. She sees that
age is not," a matter of years, but of
thought and' activities. Therefore she
keeps her thoughts fresh and vigorous
and" engages in pursuits that give mind
arid body plenty of stimulating exercise.
She keeps .her entire being so alive' and
so interested, she is so busy and her life
is. so happy that she hasn't time to re-,
member just how old she is. ; .
Do - not charge a woman' with deceit
who is disinclined \u25a0to advertise her age.
Her disinclination is not necessarily an
evidence of deceit. Rather,' it is a sign of
advancement. . \u25a0\u25a0."'' r \u25a0 '. ';' \u25a0
What is the secret? Wherein lies the
difference? Not in any change that has
taken place in nature's laws. Youth was
just as possible for women twenty-five
years ago as it is now. The secret is just
this: In those days women were not per
mitted to forget their years. The various
customs- and conventions prescribed by
the ignorance of the period to mark the
different stages of a woman's progress
toward the grave served to emphasize-^o
strongly the idea of advancing decrepi
tude that the yielding sex did not have
any choice but to comply.
Women have grown stronger and more
intelligent, however, hence the refusal of
the sex to-day to >c bound by such tra
ditions. The modern woman claims the
right to forget how old she isâ as age is
counted in years* Don't ridicule her for
it and say she is ashamed to admit her
age.
Witness, too, the youth of women to
day who have passed the three-score
limit Thirty years ago the/achievement
would have been looked upon as impos
sible.
It is only by forgetting about years
that women are free to be young. When
custom permits woman to forget, she is
able to keep youth with her, not only in
her mind and heart, but in her physique.
It is when woman is perpetually re
minded of the flight of time that she
grows old. For instance, look back upon
the woman of 25 a quarter of a century
ago. She was an "old maid", hopelessly
out of the matrimonial market. Behold
the radiant bachelor girl of the same age
to-day. She is at the very perfection of
womanhoodâ she is young. The best of
life stretches ahead of her.
+ : â : t
THE State census ' bureau ; of Minne
sota has ruled that women cannot be
compelled to tell how old they are
when questioned by enumerators.
Good! This ia a step in the direction of
progress.
The right of women to forget age is
something our advancing, civilization is
beginning to - recognize. Any step that
will help women not to be old is a good
step. Any measure that will assist in
freeing the sex from the stupid tradi
tions of centuries concerning age is a
benefit to humanityâ an aid to evolution.
Why shouldn't women . be permitted to
forget how old they are? It is -constant
remembering that really establishes old
age. It is continually holding in -mind
a record of the milestones one has pass
ed that fastens upon the mentality the
idea of physical degeneracy. And this
idea in turn pictures itself upon the body.
q^HE government officials of San Francisco have received no
| c Â° uncertain summons to the bar of public opinion and there ought
* to be no doubt as to the verdict that will be delivered. If the
worthy elements of the city possess one-half the unanimity and the
determination that "is -evidenced by the unworthy, the^ issue will not
be for one moment in doubt. .The movement toward civic purity
seems now to possess a sincerity -that is very properly evidenced by
a small measure of self-reproach, and we may well hope that this
healthy attitude is the beginning of better things.
The case against the city authorities is not only a strong one,
but it is unanswerable. The whole history of, the city during the
past few years fs a Jong record of maladministration in every form
from dishonesty to incompetency. There 'is no longer any need to
labor the question as to' whether the city is or is not ill governed,
nor is there need to select illustrations either of the contemptuous
neglect of duty or of the greedy dishonesty that has forgotten, if
indeed it ever knew, how to feel ashamed. The revolting catalogue,
of public scandals has' become so monotonous that the disclosure of
new misdeeds is no longer regarded even as a passing sensation.
When official misbehavior has become ordinary and common
place it would be futile to expect any kind of efficiency in the work
ing of the departments upon which the comfort and the safety of
ihe- citizen so largely depend. Nothing is more contagious than'
graft, and nothing more quickly penetrates to the lowest stratum of
official life. Graft in high places, naked and unashamed, necessarily
means that the condition of .the streets is one of dangerous decay,
that the police force is undermanned, that violent criminals pursue
their evil courses with practical impunity, and that dishonest cor
porations are able to flout public interest and to coin the public
convenience into dividends. â¢
The remedy cannot be applied without self-sacrifice and hard
work. City politics cannot be abolished, and if good men will not
undertake it for the welfare of the city, then bad men will for their
own welfare. The key to the whole situation- is the primaries, but
the work must not be left to a mere handful of public spirited men.
]t must.be done by the 1 united determination of every decent element
in the city, of every law abiding and virtuous element. This ought
not to be a struggle of one political party against another, but rather
of honest men against dishonest men, of good citizens against bad
ones. :

Where the underground system ends
and the overhead might begin the car
can be switched,, so ' the inventor
claims, on to any other line by
simply raising; an, overhead pole with
which !\u2666 is equipped. .The cost of in
stallation : is estimated by the Inventor
at a trifling sum compared with the en
tire change of the conduits. A saving
is effected in the iron motive groove by
the fact that this cheap material' of
fers more surface to the "current than
the copper wire. The only other cost Is
the'laying of ; the main' feed wire if un
derground, or stringing it overhead.:
. The underground ;grooved rail is so
constructed as to ':.. be drained -of
water, the '\u25a0' Inventor claims.^ Where
switches . ; and crossings occur, the
grooved rail ceases ; and a flat plate is
substituted, over .which the cable loop
glides while the wheels of the car fol
low the desired track. With the. new
system a series of cutout boxes are ar
ranged so - thatj in case of accident or
fire a particular block may be cutout
without â¢stopping' the entire circuit.' .\u25a0';\u25a0:
Mr. Crouch expects his invention to
revolutionize electric road systems. He
has working models which on minia
ture tracks demonstrate Its "feasibility
and is willing, to ; meet the \u25a0engineers of
the ; city or the United Railroads in rdis-'r dis-'
cussion and' demonstration of its work
ing. This is the first time that the In
ventor has taken his proposition before
the 'public.
The scheme of the inventor provides
a. loop steel wire running lengthwise
under the car in a grooved channel that
Is charged with the motive power. This
channel is supported in the old cable
conduit on insulators and may be in
stalled in sections so that ' it will not be
necessary to tear up the. 'entire line to
make the change. The loop of wire
trails In the groove, in a manner re
versing that over the overhead trolley
where the grooved wheel runs along
the wire. In the former there will bo
six feet of contact, while the latter only
has a small segment of the' trolley
wheel. -<'-k-;
The three important things of prac
tical value In the new invention are
the slight cost of change from cable to
underground electric, the short time
necessary to effect the change and the
possibility of easy joining with the
overhead systems. The old cable con
duits may be used, says Mr. Crouch, and
the old slot retained. Several new feat
ures in electric railroading are also
added. \ ';<;â¢: &Â£:r
The main objection of the United
Railroads to the Installation of an un
derground electric conduit system on
the antiquated Suttcr-street cable road
has been the cost that such a change
would involve. This, according to a well
known electrical engineer, F. J. Crouch,
is obviated. â¢
"At the time the case came up before
the San Francisco Superior Court the
constitutionality of 'the law under
which the defendant was arrested was
questioned, as it was claimed j that the
arrest was contrary. ; to the fourteenth
amendment 'and! was enforced only
against Chlnnese..'* *

States has upheld the ordinance of

Visitors are shown freely through the
works and can follow the steps of mak-
ing Grape-Nuts from the grain to tho
finished product. The proportions 'of
different kinds of flour and the temper-
atures arc not disclosed, and it beems
impossible for others to steal these se-
crets of the makers.' But purity, clean-
liness and skill are shown in every
corner of the immense pure food facto-
ries. People. who care for results from
choicely selected food, those who want
the food to rebuild the soft gray sub-
stance in the brain and nerves that
give the go, the vigor, the life, will un-
derstand why the Imitators who try to
copy the announcements about Grape-
Nuts have failed in the past.
There's a reajrbn ' for Grape-Nuts and
a profound one.
When finished, each little granule
will show a sparkling substance on its
surface. A magnifying glass will bring
it out clearer and develop little pieces
of pure dextrose sugar, not put on "or
poured over" (as the head of a large
Sanitarium once stated in his paper,
thus exposing his appalling -ignorance
of food processes), but this sugar ex-
udes from the interior of each as the
starch is slowly turned to sugar in the
process of manufacture. This kind of
sugar is exactly like what is found in
the human Intestines, provided the
starch of the grains, potatoes, bread,
rice, cake, etc., etc . has been perfectly
digested. But many are weak In that
form of digestion and yet need the
etarches, so Grape-Nuts supplies them
pre-digested and ready to go quickly
into the blood.
Contrasted with this pretense, ob-
iserye the care, method and skill in
majiing Grape-Nuts.
The barley is soaked about one hun-
dred hours, then it is slowly warmed
for some days and sprouted, the dias-
tase being developed and part of the
etarch turued to sugar (and later on all
of it), then xhe grains are baked and
the sprouts stripped off. Then comes
grinding, sifting, and mixing with the
creamy colored flour made from white
end macaroni wheat. This mixture
must be skillfully made in right pro-
portions This blended flour contains
just the ingredients demanded by na-
ture to rebuild the soft gray substance
in the nerve' centers and brain, but how
to s make the food easy to digest, that
was the question.
It certainly would not do to mix in
drugs, for there is a certain failure
sure to come to the person depending
on drugs to digest food. They may do
for a temporary- expedient, but pure
"food and digestible food is the only
final resort and safe way. So to
change the remaining starch part and
prepare the ' other elements in this
blended Hour It is made up into massive
loaves like bread, the inside being: dark
cream color and quite 6ticky to the
touch. These loaves are sliced and again
go through long cooking at certain tem-
peratures. Then the rock-hard slices
are each one carefully inspected and
ground ready for packing and use, hav-
ing gone through 10 or 12 hoars in the
different operations.
Chemical anaJysis tells the truth and'
the analysis of the famous chemists of
the world show GraÃe-Nuts the only
prepared breakfast food in whrch the
starch part of the wheat and barley
has been transformed tnto sugar and
therefore ready for immediate diges-
tion. Why is, this true? All the thin
rolled flake foods are made by soaking
the grains of wheat or oats in water,
then rolling, drying and packing. These
operations do not cook or pre-digest the
starch.
But false statements of the merits of
iiuinan food "w-iil never on earth build

ST. LOUIS ENTRIES.
SEATTLE, May 30. â Six favorites out
of seven races furnished a. surprise at
The Meadows this afternoon. In the
fifth race the second choice won and
the talent evened up somewhat. Fully
10,000 people were at the track and
the Decoration Day handicap, with six
of the best horses to race here | this
season entered, proved an attraction.
Betting was heavy at all .the books and
without exception they closed good
winners. The odds on the winners to
day were so small that most of the
money was placed short and this side
of the business alone prevented a har
vest. v : / \u25a0 : ;
In the handicap St. George Jr., Ocy
rohe, Hugh McGowan, Bombardier, Stil
icho and Judge started. From the open-
Ing of the betting St. George Jr. . was
favorite, selling throughout at even
money. Bombardier, opened >even and
closed 5 to"^, while Hugh McGowan
carried a greater share of the money.
McGowan was not in form. St. George
took the lead from the start and gained
steadily, passing the judges' stand two
lengths ahead of Ocyrohe. a 9 'to 2 shot.
The weather was all that could be
asked and the track was fast. The fol
lowing are the" results:;
â¢ First race, six furlongs â El Chihuahua (8 to
6. 3 to 5. 3 to 10), won; Goldflnder (5 to 1, 5

Special Dispatch to ThÂ« 'CalL
Mark Shaughnessy was chosen referee
for the Hanlon-Corbett fight last night
after a brief conference in which the
two boxers and Morris Levy figured. The
men met in Levy's apartments and came
to terms without wasting much time.
Hanlon held out for Eddie Smith of
Oakland, while Corbett wanted Ned
Homan or Billy Roche. Finally the name
of Shaughnessy was mentioned and Cor
bett agreed to have Mark act. Eddie
still" insisted on; Smith, but when he saw
there was no chance of securing the ser
vices of the Oakland man" he agreed on
Shaughnessy. The latter has had a lot
of experience In the ring. This is the
first important fight he has refereed here.
Eddie Hanlon bubbled over with cheer
fulness and animal spirits yesterday at
Alameda. The causes of this happy con
dition were the prospects of securing a
match with Jimmy Britt, and the little
fellow's splendid physical itrim. Hanlon
and his trainer, Frank McDonald, believe
he is at his best, and that nothing has
been left undone in the training grind
â¢that would enhance his chances for a vic
tory Friday night. Eddie took his usual
stroll along the avenues of Alameda yes
terday morning, and in the afternoon
mauled the bag for five rounds and
skipped the rope a thousand times. He
was visited in the afternoon by Harry
and Tom Corbett and Colonel Martin
Brady. To-day Hanlon will, in addition to
going through his regular gymnasium
stunts, engage in a wrestling and pulling
bout with Toby Irwln. Eddie's weight is
now hovering about the 132-pound mark.
Corbett'had many visitors at his train-
Ing camp at the bsach yesterday, and he
worked hard before the admiring throng.
The little* Denverite certainly ' has put in
some hard licks in getting into form for
Friday, night's conflict, and should be
ready mhen he enters the ring. He fig
ures on making the weight soon now, and
expects to be stronger than when he en
tered the ring with Nelson.
The monthly amateur boxing show of
the Hawthorne Club will be held to-night
at Woodward's pavilion. A good card has
been arranged. Including bouts between
heavyweights Sullivan and Kaufman,
Jack McLaughlin and Walter Stanton,
William Christie and J. St. Clair. Bob
Ritchie and Al Elkins and other promi
nent lights of the arena.

OAKLAND, May 30.â The first annual

ance Athletic Club was held to-day at
the Emeryville track. The club's attempt

Another member resorted to fisticuffs
to convince a bystander that a horse was
not pulled in one of the races. .
The racing was made tedious by the
drivers, over whom the officials had no
control. In the first heat of the 2:35 class
they scored for more than an hour'be
fore a start was effected. First one
driver offended and then another. Eros
mont made several attempts to run away
with Dan Lieginger and spoiled a num
ber of starts.
. Each of the four harness races was
won In straight heats. The correct time
was suppressed in ; several instances ,In
order not to give the horse 3 a low mark.
The principal event of the day, the free

The Parkway handicap, run at Graves
end to-day for the nineteenth time In its
history, had ten' starters and was worth
$3335 to ' the winner. This proved to be
the *0 to 1 shot Buttling, the three-year
old son of Star Ruby, owned by John L.
McGlnnis. When he won his initial race
one year ago at Oravesend Buttling was
at 100 to 1. ' At Belmont Park, about three
weeks since, he won a stake in heavy go-
Ing and when he next ran he was almost
as strongly fancied as was Hot Shot,
which won, or Prince Hamburg, which
was beaten.
Hildebrand, the star rider of last season.
was suspended to-day for' the remainder
of the meeting: by the stewards of the
Brooklyn Jockey Club. His case has
been referred to the stewards of the
Jockey Club for further action. -'-.
In their decision the stewards declared
that tho finish of Hildebrana on Duenna,
when that filly was beaten by Last Cher
ry, showed incompetence. This finding,
considering: that" Hildebrand was the
greatest Jockey in America last season
and was in the employ- of Herman B.
Duryea and Harry Payne Whitney, at a
salary of 510,000 a year, is practically a
declaration by the stewards that his
handling of Duenna warrants the with
drawal of his license.

The first annual, regatta of the Pacific
Association of Amateur Oarsmen was
held on the channel above Vallejo yes
terday afternoon. It was attended by
several thousand people, many of. whom
were from San Francisco, Oakland and
Alameda. The races were scheduled for
1 p. m., but it was an hour later before
the-first event was called. The clubs en
tered were the Ariel Rowing Club, Ala
meda Boat Club, Dolphin Boat Club and
the Vallejo Yachting and Rowing. Club.
The first event was * the junior barge
race, which was won by the Dolphins by
a full length. The race for second place
was between the Alamedas and. the"
Ariels. It was declared a dead heat.
The opinion of the spectators favored the
Alamedas. The start in the race . was
poor, the Alameda cew getting off last
and taking a course too far in toward
shore. '
The senior skiff rac6 was won by F. W.
Ayers of # Alameda in . nine minutes fifty
three seconds, S. J. Sherry of the Ariel.^
was second. . T. A. Wilson of the Ariels,
who won this event at. Lake Merritt on
July 4, 1904, did not start, as the bay was
too rough for his skiff.- .' â¢ .
The senior barge race was won easily
by the Dolphin crew by more than five
lengths. Alameda was the only other
entry in this event. Time, 7:41 2-5.
The intermediate barge ' race was one
of the beat contests of .the day, and re
sulted in a victory for the Alameda crew
in 10:13. The were second and
Ariels third. \ ;'
The cutter race between ., crews from
the U. S. S. Marblehead and the U. S. S.
Princeton was f^the 1 star event of the day.
It was won by the Marblehead cutter in
7:42. The Marblehead crew claims the
championship of the Pacific squadron,
and a great deal of money changed hands
on this event.
The Junior 'skiff was won. by Alex Kee
gan of the Ariels in 10:46. Charles Quit
zow of the Alameda caught a "crab" with
his oar when a half mile jof | the course
had been covered, capsizing his craft.
In the four-oared shell race between the
Vallejo Yachting and Rowing Club and
the Ariels, the Ariels were leading sev
eral lengths when George Savage of Val
lejo lost his oar overboard and followed
it into the ' water. He was picked up by
a yacht, and the race was continued by
the VffSejo crew_ without him. When
within ten lengths of the finish the shell
of the Ariels,-. which by this time led, the
Vallejos by more than 100 yards, capsized,
and despite the efforts of the Ariel crew
to right their craft in time, the .Vallejo
men crossed the line and won' the prize.
Time, 12 minutes.;.
The race between the Russian crews
from the â¢ cruiser , Lena was ' abandoned
owing to the depressed feeling of the men
over the defeat of the Russian 'squadron.

[' Maybe old -.wrinkles Van HaJtren would
like tb.be a common everyday .'ballplayer
iihstead of captain-rhapager and master
>of ceremorries of one baseball team. When
your nine Btits walloped six tirries witHout
.a break it sounds like soing.spme. That
-is theTv/ay. the Commr.te.r^ are ..riding, for
(the Tigers- made it halt 'a "dozen in a row
;yesterdaj T , whenthey' won.'3'to 1, at Rec
reatifin Park. \u25a0â¢\u0084.â¢' i v , ' Â«- \u25a0 - .
Just a few. little breaks-; threw.- the. game
away." If Oscar Graham could make; th'at
spit ball on his jump right in every inning
the Tigers would never, have had. a license
to get a run. Then had not the sun gKone
so brightly in the eyes of Julie Streib and
Kink. Kelly something else would have
happened. All these things came. to pass
and so ditl a victory for the band of
jungle monsters.
Graham pitched one of the greatest
games of the season. He worked a spit
ball that had â¢ curves to it many feet
high, low, inside and outside. Eleven
times did "the Tigers bite at it without
locating anythng but a bit of atmosphere!.
Oscar, however, lost himself in the third
spasm and the Tigers werequlck to send
in a delegation of two. \u0084 '
Bobby Keefe was also in evidence. He
winged out seven, besides having perfect
control of the leather and receiving back
ing up from the fields that would win a
game "in anybody's leag"ue.\u0094 The Tigers
llelded in the grandest possible kind of
form, not one of them falling down,
though hard chances came through every
minute.
Graham went wrong for the first time
in the, third,. when he passed Hogan and
Keefe and let Doyle tap safely over
second. Sheehan swung through to left
and brought in two men.- Nordykfi bunted
and Graham was late with the throw,
leaving three on the sacks and no dead
ones. The erratic southpaw then began
to pitch baseball again, striking out the
next . two I men and forcing the third to
fly to left. ,
I Oakland, could not get a hit until the
j sixth, wheir^KeHy punched one to the
'sctfre boara~fo r r"a pair of sacks. Dever
eaux put him up on an out and Frahcks*
long fly to the right garden let him sneak
[: in with the only one the Commuters could

Oakland got the jams again in the
seventh. After Keefe had flown Kelly
stepped away from Doyle's hit and let it
go safely When it should have been a
dead one. Sheehan walked and when
Graham tossed to first to catch him asleep
Streib did a stunt like Kelly, the ball go
ing to the right field bleachers and Doyle
coming through to the pan. The score:' '

TACOMA, May 30. â Mrs. John Gore,
while apparently Insane, forced her
way Into the kitchen of the Irving
apartments and began exhorting the
frightened women of the house on the
beauties of spiritualism. Reaching the
pantry she knelt down and began pray
ing. She was carried to the police sta
tion by officers who found her uncon
scious. , After being revived she gave
another sermon on spirits. She .will be
examined for insanity. Her husband
says that she has had similar spells be
fore, following the reading of spiritual
ist magazines.

The Pacific Coast Steamship Company's
little white liner Curacao. Captain R. J.
Paulsen. arrived from Mexico yesterday,
twelve days from Guaymas. She encoun
tered none of the heavy weather which
gave the City of Panama a taste of sub
marine navigation. From the Gulf of
California to the Golden Gate the Cura
cao sailed summer seas. On both out
ward and homeward runs the Curacao
carried ail the cargo she could accommo
date.
Among the passengers were some prom
inent members of the American colony
at Mazatlan, who will leave their fam
ilies in the States during the hot season
In Mexico. E. Peredes, Attorney-General
of the State of Slnaloa, arrived on the
Cure-coa, accompanied by his daughter.
On her last voyage, the Curacoa re
ported the seizure at San Jose del Cabo
of the Eloop Karl, owned and manned- by
one lone navigator, Captain LukendeL
Iyukendel was bound from Victoria, B. C,
ior an Island below the equator on a
prospecting excursion. A eea shipped in
Magdalena Bay had washed overboard
his papers, destroyed his provisions and
tainted his supply of drinking water. He
put Into San Jose in distress, and was
held by the Mexican authorities pending
an investigation into his paperless con
dition. He was subsequently given clear
ance to Mazatlan, from which port he
had departed prior to the Curacao's ar
rival.
The new lightships No. "6 and No. 83,
bound here from the Atlantic, were In
quarantine at the United States coaling
station at Plchlinaue on May 20. The
Curacoa exchanged salutes with the Gov
ernment vessels as the liner passed the
station on her way from La Paz. Each
lightship was flying a yellow flag, but
beyond the three whistle blasts of greet
ing there was no communication between
the Curacao and the vessels at the sta
tion. -
The Curacoa has about 1200 tons of
cargo, which Includes 600 tons of val
uabl< ore*. She also brings from the
mines of Mexico gold bricks worth about
5200,000.
Richard Klessattel. a mining engineer,
who returned yesterday on the Curacoa
from Sonora. stated that one evening he
was out riding In the vicinity of his
camp, when several shots were fired at
him. He supposed the shots were fired
by Yaqui Indians. The chief of- the
Yaquis afterward told him that the shots
â¢were not from the Yaquis, but were fired
by Mexican bandits.
Following was the list of the Cura
cao's cabin passengers: L. A. Camp
bell, L. Campbell, M. Campbell. W. M.
Smouse, Charles F. Loker. E. M. Brian, ;
Lally Brian, Mary King. Emmet King.

Unlike most young players, Schmidt,
after losing the third set by a "small
margin; was not a bit discouraged,
but played '\u25a0 harder than; ever. ';'" He was
invincible, in s the early ' part of the
fourth /and deciding set Gardner led
at 2âl,2 â 1, but Schmidt took the next four
games, giving.'- him the .commanding
lead of 5â 2. : It looked Ukesebi all at
this stage of "the"' game," but' Gardner
kept right at his" task: and try as he
.would Schmidt could not-. get the game
that would have evened up the score
for him. Gardner finally pulled it out
by a score of Bâ 6. ; .
In -, the semi-finals Gardner beat
Charles" Foley "easily," the score- being
6â3, 6âl. $ Schmidt had a harder time,
disposing of Hairy Rolfe In this round.
The latter won the first set easily, .but
played himself outl ""ln "the* second and
third sets Bolfe was tired.- while
Schmidt kept getting stronger. The
score was \u25a0 3-^6. 6â1," 6â2."" "
The championship match , between
Murdock: and 'Gardner .will be played
in the "California Club' courts next Sun
day at ' 2 :30 o'clock/: ' Gardner's victory
was a, well-earned one. He proved
beyond a doubt* that he was "the best
'man in "the '] tournament. ~ .â¢
\u25a0^iFlrst prize: goes; tpV<3ardnerf second
to Schmidt," and th^ "' wo "third prizes
to and Rolfe.
By beating Herbert Schmidt . In , the
finals '\u25a0 of Cthe San Francisco "tennis
championship tournament jln tae Cali
fornia Club courts yesterday^ Cai-1 Gard-.
ner earned the right/to challenge Percy
Murdock, - the"" champion: They will
meet ori Sunday \u25a0 ; to 'determine the
championship for 1905. ~
The final -match' was 'by far the best
of ithe tournament and was the closest
and most exciting'" played in the courts
in"' many months. Both of the young
experts were 'at -their best, and the
spectators "were treated to; some un
usually good tennis. , -Gardner won
three sets out of four, but the match
was closer than " many five set affairs.
The game in. Gardner's favor was
6â4, 2â6,2 â 6, 9â7,9 â 7, Bâ 6. "
It was a brilliant player against a
steady one, and; as is usually the case
when they are in the same "class, the
latter won. - Schmidt's work was spec
tacular, while Gardner played a - less
showy but a' more" : effective' game.
Schmidt made some wonderful re
turns,' getting ; back' seemingly impos
sible balls. At the ;. net \u25a0 he was by far
the stronger of fne two," while in .the
back court Gardner ! excelled. He used
a half-speed, 1 back-hand drive, with
which ' he "'- passed time after
time. The real' struggle began in : 'the
third set, after each" player had a set
to : his credit.' j The \ game \ seesawed
after;: 3 â2: had been reached," neither
player, being more .than a game ahead
at -"any : tlme. Gardner finally won by
a score 'of 9-â 7. 'He led/at Z-^rQ; but
Schmidt \u25a0'. took the next three games.

The numerous counter attractions
did not prevent a big attendance at

a few hours after sunrise until sun
set the westbound cars were well filled

The weather was just cool enough for

twelfth annual outing at Sunset -Park
yesterday. .More than 4000 merry-mak

The day was spent In dancing, games,
roaming over the trails and. Sp",6rtfi(g
in the stream that flows through ''the

The other bulls were warped ashore
with heavy lines and made fast to the
railroad track. When the Curacao sail
ed Taurus the First and Second of that
name were still at liberty. Taurus the
First was in full control of all the hill
pasturage to the eastward. Taurus the
Second, to the westward, had enlisted
the services of a burro as pilot, and un
der the direction of his little guide was
eating up all the verdure on his side of
T opo! obampo.
He then made a gran~ rush through
the crowd, leaped from the wharf to
the beach, marched through the surf
and swam out to the offshore side of
the Curacao. A boat was manned, the
bull captured and towed back to shore.
Once on the beach, he resumed the of
fensive and attacked the boat. All
hands dived overboard. Turning from
the empty boat, the bull discovered W.
G. McCormlck. the stout and smiling
American agent at Topolobampo for
the Mexican and Oriental Navigation
Company.
"He's killed!" shrieked a woman from
the topmost tier of a pile of sugar. Me-
Cormick had lost most of his ward
robe, but 6tlll retained some presence
of mind and. making a record standing
Jump, landed far out in deep water.
And then the bull, bellowing in vic
torious glee, with McCormick's shirt on
one born and the American agent's
linen pantaloons streaming in ribbons
from the other, started up the hill.
Taurus the First had gone to the east
ward. Taurus the Second headed due
west.
The Curacao, which arrived from Mexi
can ports yesterday, carried from this port
fix balls for Topolobampo. The ani
mals were landed safely at their des
tination. j.neir arrival and the" events
which In rapid succession followed
their landing on Mexican soil will not
6oon bÂ« forgotten in that region of hot
days and warmer, nights.
ThÂ« bulls were beasts of high degree.
They "were young and spirited, but
while on board the Curacao behaved as
well bred Btock should. Their exem
plary conduct continued right up. to the
time they were ushered, one at a time,
Into the horse box in which they made
aerial flignt from chip to shore.
The firet bull stepped unreluctantiy
from his stall into the crude airship.
A gate was closed behind him. "Hoist
away." eang Chief Officer Quinn, and
box and bull were yanked high above
the Curacao s deck. Landed on the
wharf, the gate was opened and Taurus
the First backed on Mexican soiL
The rancher to whom the animals
werÂ« consigned had detailed six peons
for the duty of receiving the bulls.
Each armed with a short rope, Â« the
Mexican laborers stood smiling on the
wharf waiting to lead away the # horned
pets.
â¢There's your bull; take him away,"
safd Mate Quinn as Taurus the First
stepped clear of the airship and sur
veyed the neighborhood Into which fate
and the Curacao's tackle had dropped
him.
The bull snorted. He pawed the
wharf for a second or two and then
tried to uppercut with his starboard
horn the man who held the rope which
restrained his liberty. Somebody
laugbed. The bull lowered "his head
and made a rush at the gleeful one,
whose smile wore off as he and the
bull went sprinting through the crowd.
The peon released his hold on tne rope
and after throwing a few more scares
into the assembled Mexicans, the bull
started for the hills. Topolobampo's
main thoroughfare was deserted in a
second and long before the fear-strick
en inhabitants cautiously opened their
doors Taurus the First had disappeared
In a cloud of dust over the high hill on
the face of which sits the town.
Taurus the Second was accepted in
the same informal way. but created
more excitement before taking his de
parture. With one throw of his neck
he freed himself from the man with the
rope and then, selecting first one and
then another of those assembled to see
the fun. he ran about a dozen Topolo
bampoites of various shades \u25a0 to the
tops of lumber piles and into dark re
cesses beneath the wharf.
There was a great "gathering . of the
clans" at Bhell Mound Par^" yesterday, the
occasion being the' annual games of the,
Caledonian ] Club. \u25a0 More than 12.000^ people
were on the. grounds, the largest gather-.

A feature of the day was the appearance
of William Steen, the head of the Order
of Scottish Clans of the United States
and Canada. He arrived. for his first visit^
to this city on Monday night, and Chief*
McÃae and William Mitchell, chairman of
the Music Committee, extended to him the

him and \the members of Clan Fraser.
from their headquarters at 32 O'Farrell
street, yesterday; morning, to the ferry,
thence to Shell Mound Park. The clan
made a . fine appearance, being over 100
in number, dressed in kilts or plaid and
bonnet. At the grounds ex^Chief D. R.

mother thinks of the; absent husband
and father and speculates how long it
will be before /the scandal fades from
the memories; of men. '
.Early yesterday morning Mrs. Rosa
Torturici called' upon -Police Captain
Burnett' to Teport that she .was still
within call of the authorities and that
she had no Intention of 'leaving j.H the
city. She carried her baby and was oc
companled *by ilrs. Julia ' Vanni, , ,at
whose house she is living:. Mrs. Tor
turici said she understood that she was
required -to , report daily to the ; police
concerning her whereabouts, but- Cap
tain' Burnett assured her that tha,t was
not necessary. She. then asked: that
her. meager, furniture, stored with the
property clerk, shoufd be delivered;- to
her, as shewished to- set up housekeep
ing. This privilege was granted.' This
was the furniture of the rooms she
and . her husband ; occupied -when - the
body of .Biagglo Vilardo was hacked! to
pieces by 'her husband.. Evidently the
ghostly- souvenirs of that . revolting
murder would call to; her simple, mind
no ghosts of remorse for. her part in
shielding the murderer. The table at
which Vilardo was sitting when he was
stricken : down- with" a cleaver in the
hands of Pictro Torturici would, recall
no horrifying .â remembrances .to. her.
Even the chair on which the victim sat
would not be proclaimed taboo, and her
little chuckling baby would, sit on a
pillow upon? it and goo, goo, while tno
table was being spread. It Is remem
bered that the wife helpedto cleanup
the blood that' the husband had shed.
It was a disagreeable task, 1 but she was
the" wife' of the murderer and to her he
was more than;.'anyi one' else 'in the
world. In the hands 'of 'her. kind and
sympathetic countrywomen she- could
ignore the past and llverfor her absent
husband, her present baby and! for the
