Nearly every Democrat of promi
nence-in the State is now supporting
Olney and it Is not believed that
Hearst's new Boston paper, which ia
due, April 5. will appear in season to
turn the tide.
BOSTON. Mass.. March IS. â Hearst
men got but cold comfort at the meet
ing of the Democratic State Commit
tee held in Boston to-day. At the rery
first test vote they were decisively de
feated by the Olney boomers and only
by the most adroit political engineer
ing did they avert a direct \ contest on
the main issues.
-The- vote came when John O'Gara
of Spencer, the veteran leader of the
Hearst Â¦ forces from the western part
of the State; moved that the State con
vention be composed of one delegate
at large from each town, city and
ward and one delegate additional for
every fifteen Democratic votes cast
for Governor at the last State election.
This would make a total of 1700 dele
gates. The Hearst men wanted a large
convention and a late date.
O*Gara*3 motion was voted down â
37 to 14. The basis of representation
adopted was one delegate from each
city, town and ward and one for every
200 votes or fraction thereof cast for
Colonel Gaston' last November. This
makes a total of 1016. The date of
the convention was set for April 21.
The Hearst men wanted it at least two
weeks, later. -The, State will send four
delegates at large and as many alter
nates to St. Louis and two delegates
and two* alternates from each Con
gressional district. â¢ It can be positive
ly announced that all the delegates to
St. Louis will be instructed to vote for
Richard Olney for President and that
the ; unit rule will be adopted and en
forced.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
BAKERSFIELD, March" 16.â The
entire story of the Mojave lynching is
now known. Twelve witnesses have
confessed and told everything. About
thirty persons are more or less im
plicated in the crime. Most of them
are employed around Mojave, many of
them in the railroad shops. There are
none of them except Cowan charged
with having had anything to do with
the actual shooting.
District Attorney Laird is in doubt
whether all the members of the mob
or only the leaders should be prose
cuted. ,The matter will probably be
submitted to the Grand Jury. â¢' in the
meantime no further arrests have
been made, the jjrincipal offenders be
ing in custody. For good reasons the
District Attorney does not desire to di
vulge the names of witnesses.
According to the statements of the
witnesses Cummings was shot at the
Jail door by- Cowan, who fired' two
shots. One of the witnesses said last
night that th2> prisoner, although bad
ly wounded, closed with him and in
the scuffle they fell, with the witness
on top. Cowan then came up-with his
rifle, and. pointing it at the negro, or
dered him to 'quit his struggling, say
ing:
"Stop your. fighting, you nigger," or
I'll blow your head off."
From what can be learned from the
statements of . the witness District
Attorney Laird is of the opinion that
the negro was struck- by the second
shot and was struggling blindly when
he seized the witness referred to, and
that he was a cornse when the* mob
applied the oil afld feathers which
were on the remains when they' were
found.
i- PARIS, March 17 f â The Tokio corre
spondent of .the Matin' sends this infor
mation, which he says comes from re
liable authority, concerning the Jap
anese military situation up to March
10:
"The first 'army of 70.000 troops un
der General Kuroki occupies Northern
Korea. Thp brigade landed .at Gonsan
forms part of a second army of similar
strength. The mobilization of the lat
ter has been completed and the troops
will sail shortly for an unknown desti
nation. The mobilization of a third
army becan on March 7."
The Echo de Paris publishes a dis
patch from its St. Petersburg corre
spondent, which says that the idea of
the- Russian Baltic squadron going to
the Far East by the northeast passage
has been given up as too risky. The
fleet probably will start In July and go
by way of the Cape of Good Hope.
ST. PETERSBURG, March 18.âOffi
cial orders were published Â¦ to-day re
lieving Vice Admiral Stark from the
command of the Port Arthur division
of the navy, ostensibly on account of
IlNhealth. No successor will be ap
pointed. Vice Admiral Marakoff having
determined to serve as squadron com
mander, as well as commander in chief
of the entire Russian naval forces in
the Far East. -
The talk of poisoned swords having
been left behind by the Japanese is
based on the mis-translation of a Rus-^
sian technical term. General Zilinsky,
chief ot staff to Viceroy Alexleff, in a
telegram, said that "pyroxiline" had
been found in the form of disc-shaped
torpedoos, six inches in diaqjeter,
which the Japanese intended to use in
bestrewing- the road over which the
Russians were expected to pass, in or
der that the explosions resulting from
the imoact of the horses' hoofs might
caused a stampede.
LONDON. March 17.â The Daily Tele
graph's Sebastopol correspondent says
it is semi-officially announced that
Russia has abandoned the Idea of send
ing her Baltic squadron to the Far
East by way of Bering Straits as im
practicable. .
A Port Arthur dispatch says that
Admiral Wittsooft has been appointed
chief of Viceroy Alexieff's naval staff
and has gone to Mukden. \

NEW ORLEANS, March 16.âAc
cording to authentic advices received
here to-day a powerful protective al
liance has been formed by Brazil,
Ecuador. Argentina, Chile and Bolivia
to guard against absorption by the
United States. Those countries believe
that they will eventually be compelled
to accept annexation to America on a
plan similar to American recognition
of the new republic of Panama. The
belief prevails throughout Brazil and
Argentina that in the event of a revo
lution in either republic President
Roosevelt will intervene and recognize
the revolutionists, thus paving the way
for annexation.
It iÂ£ reported that President Zelaya
of Nicaragua has forwarded a check
for $100,000 to President Marroquin
of Colombia to assist that country in
joining the South American coalition.
The alliance was first discussed last
year, when it was ur^ed that South
American republics should belong- to
the United States while Peru was con
sidering the advisability of appealing
to President Roosevelt to establish a
protectorate inTeru.

rules of the Gladstone mine provide
that each miner of the day shift shall

Jhey had prepared their blasts and

UKIAII, March 16.â Hold-ups are be
coming quite frequent In Ukiah, two
having occurred last' night. It is
thought some San Francisco crook is
plying his vocation here. At about 11
o'clock Allen Aldrich, a clerk in Caroth
ers" cigar store, was held up by a
masked man and relieved of 35 cents
and his keys. He immediately tele
phoned to Carothers, who went to the
store and took the money out of the
till. While on his way home Will
Carothers was also held up. The high
wayman called to him to stop, but he
turned and fired his pistol at a figure
which was standing a few feet distant
and took to his heels. The thief had
probably watched Carothers close the
store and concluded that one of them
would have the proceeds of the day's
sales about his person.
Earl Jamison also had an experience
with, a r pickpocket r ,.,ha,ving his vest
pocket cut and some money, extracted.

ries would be a severe blow to Senator
Mitchell's chances of re-election in 1907,
and it was upon this point that the
fight hinged. Local issues cut little fig
ure in the campaign and both factions
were a unit in the support of the pres
ent Federal administration.
SACRAMENTO. March 16.â Nearly
800 union artisans connected with the
building trades are out of work as the
result of to-day's developments in the
labor troubles that have existed in this
city for several weeks. The difficulty
originated with the demand of journey
men plumbers for an increase of wages
to $4 50 a day and of hodcarriers to
$4 a day. The employing plumbers
and plasterers, . who belong to the
Builders' . Association, declined to ac
cede to these demands, and as a con
sequence work on many buildings
suspended. Affairs had gone along in
this, fashion for several weeks, when
last night a number of merchants, the
members of the Builders' Association
and other employers of labor organ
ized themselves into a Citizens' Alli
ance, patterned after similar organiza
tions 'in San. Francisco, Los Angeles
and other cities in the State. The Build
ers' Association this morning an
nounced that its fight would hereafter
be conducted by .the Citizens' Alliance.
Coincidentally with this announcement
came an ultimatum of the employers
in the building trades to their employes
that unless they desired to be employed
as individuals they must quit work.
The men refused to forsake their
unions and work in the building trades
ceased, except in the case of a union
here and there where the order to quit
had not yet become effective. It Is ex
pected that in a day or two all me
chanics in the building line will fce out
of employment.
It is stated that the issue was forced
at this time by the declaration, freely
made by union men, that other unions
besides the plumbers and hodcarriers
were contemplating asking for an in
crease in wages on June 1, the union
men asserting that they intended to
ask only for the scale paid ln'other im
portant cities in the State.
To add to the complications," S. Mac
kifÂ», a contractor and employer of union
labor, who does not belong to " the
Builders' Association, brought suit
against the local architects, mill men*
and supply houses, numbering in all
nearly eighty, alleging that they have
discriminated against him by refusing
to furnish him their services" or mate
rials. He ask3 for $10,000 damages, be
sides an order of court to compel the
defendants to withdraw from what he
alleges fs a conspiracy against him.
In a statement to-day A. A. -Merry,
secretary' of the Builders' Association*
said it was proposed by the alliance
to determine whether three or four men
are to continue to dominate the build
ing Industry of Sacramento.
Special Dispatch to The Call
The Senate passed without discussion
the joint resolution authorizing the
President to negotiate with the Govern
ment of Great Britain to secure a re
view of the regulations for the catching
of fur-bearing seals in Alaska, so as to
obtain an abatement of the killing of
female seals and thus preserve the seal
industry.
WASHINGTON, March 16.^-Another
entire day of the Senate was devoted
to consideration in executive session of
the nomination of General Leonard
Wood to be major general. Senator
Blackburn, resuming his speech begun
yesterday, occupied a little more than
two hours, and was followed by Sen
ator Quarles, who consumed the re
mainder of the day an^d expects to take
another hour to-morrow. It is predict
ed now that a vote will be reached be
fore adjournment Friday. In addition
to the set speeches which will be made
by Senators Teller and Foraker, Sen
ator Alger, formerly Secretary of War,
will take fifteen or twenty minutes in
defense of General Wood's executive
ability. He will speak from a personal
viewpoint The military record and the
executive ability of General Wood
formed the subjects of Senator Quarles 1
remarks. He followed very closely the
testimony before the Military Affairs
Committee, and praised General Wood
for his, conduct in the Geronimo cam
paign, the campaign against the
Apaches, the Spanish-American war
and the record he is now making in the
Philippines. Ko attention was paid by
Senator Quarles to the charges made
against General Wood, though he sug
gested that in concluding to-morrow
he would attempt to show they had not
been proved after an exhaustive in
quiry by the Senate committee.
The Interruptions in the speeches to
day were even fewer than yesterday.
Senator Foraker is depended upon by
the majority members of the Military
Committee to answer all charges that
have been made.
LOS ANGELES, March 16.â A young
woman, whose name the police posi
tively refuse to make public, was en
ticed to a room in the Cordova room
ing-house, 324 West Fifth street, this
afternoon by -a man. whose advertise
ment she had answered., robbed of $500
in gold and locked in the room while
the thief escaped. For half an hour she
pounded on the door before she at
tracted attention, and by the time she
was released the man who had robbed
her had disappeared. Not the. slightest
trace of him or clew to his identity has
'been discovered.
The robbery. was the culmination of
a carefully arranged plot. in which the
sharper hoped to secure other victims.
He advertised in all the Los Angeles
newspapers for a partner with $500,
promising $8 per day and expenses to
a female partner, and the young
woman answered the advertisement.
He called on her and told her when he
was ready to demonstrate his plan to
her he would telephone to her. To-day
she received a message telling her to
call at once at the rooming-house men
tioned and bring her money with her.
She did so and found the stranger,
who gave the name of J. B. Watson,
there. The room was filled with botties,
chemical apparatus, crucibles, boxes,
Bunson burners and other such things,
indicating that the man was a chemist.
She had her money in a coin sack,
and while she was not looking he sub
stituted a sack containing a number
of iron washers. She caught him at it
and accused him of. theft. Then he
laughed In her face and told her he
could render her unconscious with his
chemicals and leave her there. He
backed to the door and suddenly left
the room. When she tried the door
she found that he had removed the in
side doorknob and had locked the door
from the outside. In vain she tried
to break the lock, and then for half an
hour she pounded on the door before
she attracted attention of the landlady,
who released her. When she told the
police her story she exacted a pledge
of secrecy as to her name, saying she
would rather lose the money than have
her name known, but if the thief is
captured she will prosecute him.

GKRMANY EXPELS STUDENTS.
Thirty Russians Receive Notices From
Police to Leave the Country.
BERLIN. March 16.â Thirty Russian
students, several of them women, have
received, yesterday and to-day, from
the police notices of expulsion in con
sequence of participating in a meeting
held Saturday to protest against the
Government's permitting Russian
police agents to watch Russian resi
dents in -Germany.
The students have from three to
eight days in which to leave the coun
try and may select the frontier to cross,
the Government not compelling them to
return to Russia as In previous in
stances.
The origin of the dispute between
the Government and the students,
about 500 of whom are attending, the
university and technical schools, was
in the socialist accusation that the
Government was permitting Russian
spies to search the rooms, examine the
correspondence and otherwise inter
fere with the liberty of Russians living
in Germany. Foreign Secretary von
Richthofen. in defending the Govern
ment January 13, said the Russians
here were anarchists, and that many of.
the women attending the university or
other schools were reaUy not students,
but lived in a state of immorality. A
few days later from forty to fifty Rus
sians passed a resolution protesting
against these imputation*.
Chancellor von ' Bulow. answering
Herr Bebel. the socialist leader, on the
same subject. February 23. contemptu
ously alluded to the protestants as
"begjrars and conspirators under the
leadership of Mandelstamms and Sil
berbaum?."
If these fellows do not keep quiet
said the Chancellor, "we will throw
them out."
From 42S arsons who signed the
statement thirty are selected for ex
pulsion.
About 400 Russian students met on
S/uurday and signed a statement re
citing the utterances of Secretary von
Rlchthofen and Chancellor von Bulow.
Referring to the Chancellor's assertion
that they were abusing thÂ° hospitality
of Germany, the Russians said that
even guests had tho natural right of
resenting insults flung at them by their
hosts.
"Besides this." the statement con
tinued, "he undertook by referring to
the Jewish origin cf part of the Rus
sians here to arouse anti-Semitic preju
dices against us. Count von Bulow,
the highest official of the German em
pire, has not scrupled under the pro
tection of his privileged position to call
us beggars. The fact that most of the
Russians living here are of Jewish
origin is due, as Count von Bulow well
knows, to the special opposition to
which the Jews are exposed In the
Russia of Kishenev, which excludes
them from the higher educational in
stitutions c-i their native country. We
regret that the twentieth century in
the land of Lesslng and of Fichte wit
nesses such disregard for the great
idea of humanity as -evidenced by these
anti-Semitic sallies of the German
Chancellor."

SAN JOSE. March 16. â A. J. Mullen,
who is charged â¢with embezzling over
-43000 from the office of County Tax
Collector January', may plead guilty
when his trial commences to-morrow.
Jackson Hatch, one of his attorneys,
has withdrawn. This morning F. L.
Thomas appeared before Judge Tuttle
and asked, for a continuance of the
trial. This was denied. In arguing
Attorney Thomas Intimated that no
defense would be made, and- it is be
lieved that Mullen will plead guilty
and throw himself on the mercy of the
court. Mullen has been awaiting" trial
for nearly a year. The specific offense
against Mullen is that he embezzled
$30t> SS paid to him for State and
county taxes by Jacob Luther. This
is but one of the many peculations that
footed up over $3000. all of which
was made good by Tax Collector Jan

had been charged with brutality and
barbarism toward the colored 'race.
Comparing the lynchtngs and burnings
at the stake which had occurred in the
South with those in the North, he said
that the people of the South in meting
out punishment to the negro who had
committed a fiendish crime never fol
lowed it up with violence toward de
fenseless children and women as had
been done in the North. He declared
that President Roosevelt by Inviting
Booker Washington to dine at the
White House had done more to influ
ence the passions of the negro and to
give him a perverted idea of his im
portance and his near approach to so
cial equality than anything that had
been done for past years.
Spight continued: "So far as I am
concerned I am opposed to mob vio
lence as a general proposition. I do
not think that lynchings for any other
crime than the nameless one against
womanhood ought ever to occur. In
all others the courts of the country are
ample and generally, with us, swift
to punish.
"But in the one class of crimes so
brutal and destructive of all that is
dear to an enlightened people, no one
with a spa'rk of manhood in him can
doubt that instant death to the perpe
trator should follow upon the ascer
tainment of the guilty facts. The poor
suffering woman who has been the vic
tim of the devilish lust of a brute,
white or biack. should not be compelled
to appear in court and repeat before a
jury the horrible details of her wrong."
Spight recited that the burning at
the stake of "such brutes" was not con
fined to the South but had occurred in
the North as well.
Subsidies to railroads for special mail
facilities came in for much criticism by
Robinson of Indiana and Gaines of
Tennessee, the latter characterizing
them as a "legalized steal." Rural mail
carriers found many friends on the
floor who advocated increased pay for
them and the privileges of acting as
agents for newspapers and trades- :
people.
In a speech characterized by intense
vigor. Flood of Virginia asserted that
the credit for the establishment of the
rural free delivery service belonged to
the Democrats. It had. he said, been
claimed by Perry S. Heath, former
First Assistant Postmaster General.
"I am not," he said, "astonished that
a gentleman who was willing to rob
and plunder his Government and per
mit other people to rob and plunder the
Government he had sworn to protect
should rob a political opponent of the
credit to which he was entitled." j
REVEXATIONS EXPECTED.
Hints That Special Postal Committee
Will Spring Surprise.
WASHINGTON, March â¢ 16. â The
special committee of the House on the
postoffice report has, it is understood,
received the report known as "exhibit
A." This document has never been '
made public and the feeling created j
among members by the thorough man- j
ner in which the special committee is j
dealing with the task assigned it is
growing somewhat intense. Revela
tions of new "deals" are hinted at in
Ute cloakrooms. In the meantime the \
special committee is earning on its j
work behind closed doors. An all-day !
session was held to-day.
Wh*>n the committee adjourned j
Chairman McCall announced that he j
had addressed a letter to each mem- j
ber of the House mentioned in the re;
port requesting him If he so desired
to make a statement to the committee, J
either orally or in writing, touching j
the correctness of the statement in j
the report. !
The committee will meet again to
morrow, and, as indicating that the
preliminary work is nearly completed,
McCall said that it was hoped to con
duct the work in open session in two
or three days. The day, he said, had
been devoted to going over the report
so that the committee might be thor
oughly familiar with every phase of it.
This work, he said, will greatly ex
pedite the final conclusion.

sioner of Pensions Ware, with the ap

sion ruling that has been issued in a

ments have been met, claimants for

Mississippi Representative
Says the North Is Not Slow
in Dealing Out Lynch Law
Good Water Necessary, but
Under Present Conditions
It Cannot Be Obtained
WASHINGTON, Mcrch 13. â Secre
tary Taf t continued his explanation to
the House " Committee on Insular Af
fairs to-day as to conditions in the
Philippines, particularly with refer
ence to the necessity of railroad build
leg. Taking up first the Question of
internal Improvements In the islands.
Secretary Taft read a cablegram from
Governor Wright suggesting a 510,000.
000 bond Isaue for Improvements. In
this cablegram Governor Wright said
that In the last six months the customs
receipts had fallen off 25 per cent.
Secretary Taft declared his belief
that the $10,000,000 bond issue could be
sold 1 at par at 4 per cant Interest.
He to!d of the necessity of municipal
Improvements contemplated. There are
S00 towns which need water supplies
and sanitation. Tha contemplated
bond issue -would make it possible to
supply between three and four hundred
of these towns and greatly improve
their health conditions. It was de
sirable, he said, to have the preliminary
approval of the President and Secre
tary of War to the bond Issue, in order
that the bonds might be more readily
marketed.
Secretary Taft turned his attention
next to the section of the bill providing
that the collections under the immi
gration laws should be turned into the
Philippine treasury. Delegate de Getau
of Porto Rico Questioned the Secretary
as to tho effectiveness of the enforce
ment of the Chinese laws in the islands.
The census showed only 30,000 Chinese
in Manila, whereas it was supposed
there were double that number. The
inducements for a Chinese to evade the
law were great, but the Secretary be
lieved that the law was as rigorously
enforced as in the United States.
Secretary Taft said the salaries of
Judges of the Supreme Court In the
islands should be raised to $10,000. It
was difficult, he said, to retain men on
the bench there &H the salary paid.
He will continue his testimony to
morrow.

WASHINGTON. March ;6.â The Senate to
day In executive session confirmed the nomi
nations of Charles H. Robb to be Assistant
Attorney General and Captain Theodore F.
Jewett to be a rear admiral.
Major John Bigelow Jr. and his
squadron of the Ninth Cavalry had
their innings on the golf links yester
day, to the entire satisfaction of all
concerned. Everything was propitious.
The weather was cool, fresh and clear.
The troops were in fine fettle for the
fray, and the problem exercise was car
ried to a successful issue. Perhaps the
presence of a big crowd of spectators
from town caused the troopers to throw
especial zeal into their work. The pro
gramme began promptly at 8:30 a. m.
Troop X, under command of Captain
John T. Nance and Lieutenant E. H.
Rubottom, entered at the Paciflc street
entrance and took up a station in the
grove near the First avenue entrance
to the post, with the object of acting
on -the< defensive and preventing the
enemy, in the shape of Troops I, L and
M, from passing out of the post by
either the First or Seventh avenue en
trances. In this they were successful,
and by the different positions they as
sumed compelled the attacking troops
to surrender. The beginning of the
fray â¢ was marked by mounted scouts
from ' both sides reconnoiterlng about
the links and adjacent groves. The
attacking troopers, who had quietly ap
proached from the extreme west end of
the r links,'-- had been made conversant
with the "pdsition" that the defensive
troopers had assumed.
FIRE BY PLATOOXS.
Troop I dismounted and crawled up
the hill until they reached the ridge,
when they air fell flat to the ground,
and Captain Young gave the order to
open fire -by platoons oh the enemy,
_who were intrenched behind a one
time bunkers at the east end of the
links. Firing from both sides was' fast
and' furious, blank cartridges being
used.
In the meantime Major Bigelow came
up with Troop L to assist in the at
tack, followed by Troop M in charge
of the ambulances, wagons and pack
train. . ; .
Then the signal was given for a
grand charge.' This was the great ex
citing, event of the day. 'At the bugles*
shrill call to advance sabers flew from
their scabbards and with a Â¦ wild yell
the whole force of troopers, followed by
the:; wagons, ambulances and pack
trains, / dashed down . f. the incline at
breakneck speed, hoping to put the de
fensive foes to ; rout and thus secure
passageway into the open. The bold
dash," while a brilliant and inspiring
one" from a* spectacular standpoint, was
not successful from a 1 military point of
view, i as Troop K . had Â¦ both : means of
escape " carefully guarded, arid \there
was nothing to do for the attacking
party but to surrender.
FIELD HOSPITAL. DRILL.

and Frederick T. : Newbery, and each
is in hope that he will be appointed, by
the Board of Public Works in the
course of a few days. ,
The place carries with it a salary of
$5000 per year, and considerable.polit
ical pressure is being brought to bear
on Mayor Schmitz, who will have much
to say /lbbut the appointment. . -
. Rogers, who is a : hydraulic engineer
by profession, stands a splendid chance
to secure the coveted plum, although
a vigorous effort is being made on be
half of H. H. Lynch, former superin
tendent of construction for the United
Railroads, by his friends, some of
whom are very influential.
Russell Dunn, Luther Wagoner and
former City Surveyor. C 8. Tllton are
seeking appointment, but with what
hope of su^::ss time alone will tell.
President Schmitz of the Board of Pub
lic-Works says that the reason for the
delay in making the appointment lies
in the fact that it is desired to name
a competent and practical engineer in
view of the important improvements
contemplated under the bond issue and
otherwise.

mets and the Independents.
Fhrvuld tnis ordinance be adopted It will meet
all the requirements of the original ordinance
and still meet the objections of its opponents.'
It would then be the duty of the Board of Pub
lic TVorks to question Into the character of the
meetings, demanding that they shall be decent
and orderly. Further, they would use their
discretion as to the time and place of such
meetings, seeing to it that no street has more
than one meeting on it, at a time.
There is a number of email streets in the
heart of the cityâ for Instance, Union Square
avenue â where meetings could be held without
Inconvenience to any one.
Tlie writer submits that this ordinance as
amended could not possibly work an injustice
to any one. but, on the other hand, would be
of great benefit to the public as a whole.
March 15. 1WM. J. W. TREADWELU
The writer has suggested, however, to the
Board of Supervisors that the proposed ordi
nance be adopted with the following modifica
tions: That meetings of every kind are pro
hibited on the public streets and sidewalks of
this city, except by permit Issued by the Board
of Public Works, giving names of speaker or
speakers, time, date and locations of such
me*>ttnes. This ordinance makes the speakers
liable, a* well aE the individuals composing the
crowd.
The streets are presumably thoroughfares â
not ""omrooni or public meeting-places. How
ever it may not be wise to strictly enforce
this principle. Chief ,Wittn\an testifies to the
usefulness of the Salvation Army to - the
public. The good work done by this army Ik
too well- -known to comment upon, and the
writer bellovpg, for one, that It Is very much
to the advantage of this city to encourage and
not to hinder its work: provided, however,
thÂ»y arc reasonable in regard to length of
meetingp. exact locations, etc.
SALVATION ARMY USEFUL.
The need for some restriction as to the time
and plar* and order of such meetings cannot
be deni*l. I grant the right of "free speech."
but contend that it 18 within the power of the
Board of Supervisors to abridge that rirht. In
reason, and believe such a move necessary in
order to protect some constitutional rights
supposed to be enjoyed by the merchants, prop
erty-holders and the general public.
The right of "free epeech" does not entitle
a number of men to hold a noisy meeting In
front of a hospital, for Instance, where peo
ple arÂ»Â» dying: neither could a meeting be
held in a public theater during a performance,
nor in a State court while in Eession. There
fore it might to bÂ« clear that the right of
free speech is not absolute and can be regu
lated. This ordinance doer not forbid free
t[,,..-.,ti. but It does forbid crowds to assem
ble which obstruct the streets and sidewalks.
The Salvation Army dectarea that should
the proposed ordinance pass it will hold meet
ings as before, and. if necessary, suffer the
consequences. . 'V- -.--'
Resolution* condemning this proposed ordi
nance have been filed with the- Board of Su
pervisors from nearly every labor union in this
city. Â» number of cMjrches and so-called so
cialiFtP. Tlje one reason given Is thpt the
ordinance is unconstitutional and â¢'un-Ameri
can" â claiming that ever}' man has the abso
lute risht to speak at all times on any public
street of this city.
The writer has heard speakers at these meet
ingB declaring that it is their purpose to ruin
the storekeeper and property-holder, as the
present order of things is contrary to their
principles; also condemning our Police Depart
ment and other city offlclals In a ' most dis
graceful manner. In eatc-s where arrests have
been made by the police for violations of the
law. tbe crowds ! assembled liave jeered and
hootfd fo they could be heard for blocks.
LABOR UXIONS OBJECT.
The ordinance introduced in the
Board of Supervisors prohibiting street
meetings in certain districts has met
Avith much opposition .on the ground
that it is in violation of. the right of
free speech. ' There are many, how
ever, who favor its passage, and J. W.
Treadwell, a well-known business man :
believes that with a modification grant
ing the Board of Works the power oÂ£
Usuing permits for " street meetings
justice will be* done to all. Mr. Tread
well gives his views In the following
communication:
Editor of The Call:
CWcI of HoUce Wlttrnan has Introduced, at
tht instigation of a large number of down
town merchants. an ordinance prohibiting
puMic meetings of every kind on certain
crowded streets of this city, and requested
the Board of. Supervisors to pass same.
The . merchants cm Grant avenue claim that
a large number of street meetings are held
nightly on that thorouKhfare, nearly blocking
the street for legitimate traffic: that some of
the meetings are very disorderly, and the
language usori by the speakers is not of the
purest. The merchants assert that the busi
ness on that street haw b#en seriously injured
by these large crowds. Similar complaints have
also ccme from other localities.
Would Have Board of Works
Issue Permits for Gather
ings of Good Character

m SHANGHAI, March 16. â The first
rpgrul2r train on the Shantung Rail
road arrived at SInanfu from Sintac
last night, having covered the distance,
252 milc-s, in fourteen hours. The train
"was decorated with a Chinese and a
Gorman flag and had on board a num
ber of Germans. The station at SInanfu
was brilliantly illuminated.
Sinnnfu is the terminus of the Ger
â¢han railroad at the entrance of Kiao
chau Bay. the naval station of Ger
*r.any in China. Sinanfu is about 215
miles south by cast of Peking.
Paotingfu, the southernmost station
of the railroad running southwest from
Peking, is about ISO miles from Sinanfu.
Therefore, it would seem that at no
distant date Kiaochau Bay and Peking
may be connected by rail.

"During the run from Yokohama to

LOS ANGELES, March 16, â State
Senator Fred M. Smith returned home
to-night and found his wife dead in
her bedroom. She had been dead several
hours, and th<* < fact that- in another
room was found her . untouched
luncheon leads to the belief that she
died before noon. The features were
much dlscorored, but there was nothing
to Indicate that there had been any
struggle or convulsions. It Is believed
that the cause of death was either
heart disease or apoplexy.
When her husband left home Jhls
morning his wife was in an unusually
cheerful frame of mind, and they
planned to spend the evening at the
home of friends. He did not go home
to lunch, but agreed to come to an
early dinner. "When he reached the
house he found his wife's body on a
bed, and the shock so prostrated him
that he is under the care of a physi
cian to-night.
Mrs. Smith was a sister of A. D.
Shepherd, formerly general freight
agent of the Southern Pacific, now
manager of the Pacific Improvement
Company. She was well known and
very popular In many cities of the
State, particularly in San Francisco
and Sacramento, and such other places
as her husband's official duties from
time to time required his presence. In
Sacramento she was, during sessions of
the Legislature, a leader in the social
set composed of members of the law

known. to most of the members of both
houses.

3IAEX" RUSSIAN
FORCE IS NOW ON
SOIL OF KOREA
American capital is heavily invested
in tobacco manufacturing in Japan, and
the creation of a monopoly means its
early and complete exclusion.
The Cabinet after a conference with
the elder statesmen and other'politlcal
leaders has .decided to submit proposals
for the extension fo the tobacco mo
nopoly to include manufactured tobacco
and the creation of a salt monopoly to
a special session of the Diet convening
on Friday next. This would involve a
heavy outlay for the purchase of pri
vate tobacco manufacturing concerns
and the salt interests, but the advisers
of the Government regard the expendi
ture at this time as wise. The Cabinet
has also decided to suggest increases in
land income, business, wine, soy, sugar,
stock exchange, miners, customs duty
and stamp taxes, and in addition the
creation of new taxes upon silk piece
goods, kerosene and woolens â an esti
mated total increase amounting to 6S,
000.000 yen.
The war expense^ from the com
mencement of hostilities to the end of
March are estimated at 156,000,000 yen,
divided as follows: IOS.000,000 yen for
the army and 47,000,000 yen for the
navy. Of this sum only 50,000,000 yen
has actually been disbursed, including
the payment for the cruisers Nlsshin
and Kasaga, purchased abroad. The,
Government plans to meet the expendi
tures to the end of March with 100,000,
000 yen from exchequer bonds just sold.
25,000,000 yen from the special funds
and 31,000,000 yen to be raised by a tem
porary loan.
The expenditures on account of the
war from April next to December, in
clusive, are estimated at 3SO.000.000 yen,
besides a special war reserve of 40,000,
000 yen. The Government plans to meet
these expenditures by the issuance of
280,000,000 yen in exchequer bonds, 68,
000,000 yen in war taxes, 7,000,000 yen
balance on ordinary annual receipts
and 25,000,000 yen from special fund.
The foreign branches of the Yoko
hama Specie Bank report subscriptions
for the first issue of bonds totaling
850,000 yen. These bonds were . largely
subscribed for in the Hawaiian Islands
and San Francisco.
TOKIO. March 16.â Tokio is unadvised
regarding the naval plans and move
ments of the Russians and is in doubt
whether the remnant of their fleet still
is at Port Arthur or is en route to
Vladivostok. Late this afternoon a tel
egram reached the Navy Department
saying that seven Russian ships have
been reported as passing Fort Lazareff.
The report was not circumstantial. It
did not give the character of the ships
or the direction in which* they were sail
ing. It is expected that the Japanese
by their activity will speedily deter
mine the whereabouts and Intentions of
the Russians.
United States Minister Griscom called
upon Prime Minister Komura to-day
and renewed his representations con
cerning American interests affected by
the proposal of the Japanese Govern
ment to extend the tobacco monopoly
so as to include manufactured tobacco.
He urged the fair treatment of Ameri
can interests and adequate compensa
tion in the event., of a monopoly being
created. It is understood that Komura
gave him satisfactory assurances.

The Emperor and his brother, the
Grand Duke Michael, heir-presumptive
to the throne, wearing naval uniforms,
visited Galon! Island to-day and in
spected the battleships Borodino, Orel
and Andrew. They were accompanied
by the Grand Duke Alexis, high ad

Jestvensky. Captain Seberiannlkoff re
ceived the august visitors on board th*
Borodino, which the Emperor inspect
ed, minutely examining the arrange
ment of her guns and torpedo tubes
and manifesting especial interest In
the stoutness of her armor. He ex
amined the guns already on board the
Orel. The Andrew is so little advanced
in construction that she was not in
spected by the Emperor. His Majesty
conversed with the dockyard employes
and told them their work would soon
be finished, requested them to exert
their best efforts and promised to re
peat his visit in a month.
Great crowds greeted the Emperor on
his arrival and departure. He will go
to the new admiralty yard to-morrow
and later in the weeK to the Baltic
works.
The Government is building some
armored trains for use on the Manchu
rian railroad, after the model of those
ueed by the British in South Africa.
They will not be employed so much on
account of the fear that the Japane'se

effect on the Chinese robbers, who may
become emboldened by the war. It is
believed that when the bandits see the
iron monsters they will not come near

WASHINGTON. March 16.â This Gov

ficial information that China is pur
chasing vast Quantities of modern fire
arms. The fear was expressed in many
quarters that once the Chinese have
modern breech-loading rifles in their
hands they- will realize the immense
power of their 400,000,000 population
and will give rein to their natural
hatred of foreigners.
The Information, which caused the
State Department officials more uneasi
ness than they would admit, was con
tained in a report to the Department
of Commerce and Labor from B. H.
Warner, United States Consul at Leip
zig. Germany, which says:
"The Waffenfabrik at Steyr. Austria.
has just received an order through a
Berlin house for a large number of

been ordered that it will take the Steyr
factory several years to fill the same.

had held that the period of prohibition
should be ten years, addressed prac
tically all of the powers on the danger
of permitting unrestrained importation
of arms to China. These representa
tions met with indifference from prac
tically all of the powers, including the
United States. Congressional action
would have been necessary for this
Government's action. Secretary Hay
was disinclined to recommend it. even
though urged to do so many times by
Count Cassinl, the Russian Embas
sador.
The protocol provides for a renewal
of the period of prohibition two years
at a time in case of a necessity recog
nized by the powers. Action to this
end may now be taken by the powers.

Russia is reported to be moving an army corps from Vladivostok toward Korea, while dispatches from
the Xcwchwang district indicate that the Russians have taken up strong positions in well fortified towns
thereabouts, Including Ashan Shan, where the Japanese army concluded its advance during its war with
China, / ,
Much alarm has been caused by news that China has placed an enormous order for modern rifles
with a European factory. So great is the order that it will require years to fill it.
The Tokio correspondent of a Paris newspaper claims to hav reliable authority for the statement
the Japanese army advancing through Korea consists of 70,000 men; that another army of the same strength
has landed at Gensan and will sail thence to a destination at present not revealed, and that the mobiliza
tion of a third army began on March 7. Japan will have in the field 210,000 men.
MakarofT, the new commander of Russia V naval forces in the Far East, is a veritable "man of mys
tery." Tokio advices state that Japan is still unable to locate the Port Arthur fleet and is uncertain, as
to whether it has left the harbor. Since the recent bombardment of Vladivostok, the Russian Vladivostok
squadron lias not been heard from, and there is a possibility that some Joint coup is being attempted by
the two naval forces.
Port Arthur's situation continues to be serious, but rumors of Russia's alleged intention to abandon
her stronghold are again denied, the St. Petersburg newspapers being particularly bitter in denouncing
those with whom the reports originated and attributing stock jobbing motives to the fabrications.
From Port Arthur comes a bulletin declaring that all is quiet there and that there is no sign of the
From the Far East come indications that the great armies are slowly but surely advancing and that

up a position in Northwestern Korea. â¢

Sam Luka, the Kanaka boat steerer
of the steam whaler Beluga, yesterday
tendered to himself one of the most
harmonious fa^yell demonstrations
ever accorded to a departing whale
man. Sam has steered one of the boats
in which his brother hunters chase the
whale for many a" year. He likes his
work, but hates the idea of leaving
home without some kind of a sendoff*
In his native Hawaii his mud
colored friends would have gathered at
the pierhead with a band of music and
decorated their departing brother with
many-colored lels. It was a sendoff like
this that Sam wanted, and he had his
wish.
The Beluga pulled into the stream
yesterday and Just before she left
Green-street wharf Sam carried aboard
his forecastle gods and took pos
session of his quarters for the cruise.
Before going on board he spent several
hours uptown buying his o.utfit for the
voyage. Before starting on his shop
ping cruise he hired a brass band to
accompany him. From outfitter to out
fitter he marched ahead of the music.
The band had played out its repertoire
long before Sam's shopping was com
plete, but the boat steerer offered no
objection to repetitions, as long as the
music kept time with his marching.
In front of each store the band played
selections while Sam 'bargained for
rubber boots, oilskins, ,jvarm clothing
and a supply of bright-colored : odds
and ends to be used in trading with
the natives of the .-rctic. Shopping is
thirsty work and when Sam sought
relief at a tavern, the music was
stopped to allow the musicians to join
the boat steerer. in u cup to the success
of the. cruise. Then the band played for
the tavern-keeper.
Sam led the band to the wharf, bade
each' musician a ceremonius farewell,
stepped aboard and disappeared in the
whaler's forecastle.' * The band, still
under orders, Waited until Sam re
appeared with a few colls of flowers
around his neck. Then Sam's hired
musicians gave Sam 'the sendoff for
which his soul hungered. It came high,
but It was his own.

The California Development Com
pany had a contract with Carpentier
to purchase the property and it turned
the title over to Allen D. .Wilson, who
In turn sold it to the Oakland Harbor
Development Company, of which James
L. de Fremery is president.
In 1901 C. E.. Sessions Jr.,' who, suc
ceeded to all the interests his father
had in the land, made' a tender, of $50,
000, with Interest, for the purchase of
the property to the Oakland Harbor
Development Company, "which , offer
was refused. Sessions claims his con
tract is still alive and states! that he
is willing to 'pay the remainder of the
money due on it. The Oakland Harbor
Development Company does not! recog
nize any of his rights to the premises.
The trial of a suit looking to the
clearing of the title to the Sessions
Basin property, valued at $150,000, was
begun before Judge Hall to-day. The
title has become much involved, owing
to the fact that H. W. Carpentier, the
original owner, entered into contracts
with different people to sell the prop
erty. E. C Sessions brought the suit
against the Oakland Harbor Develop
ment Company,' which also claims title
to the land. -
Sessions was â¢ the first purchaser of
the property. He had a contract with
Carpentier to buy the land and paid
him about *$30,000 on the contract, be
sides spending considerable money on
improving it. He defaulted in the final
payment of $50,000 with Interest due in
1898 and Carpentier began negotiations
with others.

St. Patrick's Day at Berkeley.
Work at the Oakland terminus of
the line is progressing as rapidly as
the unsettled condition of the weather
will permit. .The new depot of the
Santa Fe is nearly completed and the
work of finishing will be commenced
this week. It is like all of the depots
of that system, built upon the mission
style of architecture. The depot at
Berkeley Is weir along and will bÂ»
finished for the opening.
The old Emery tract, which was pur
chased by the Santa Fe system for rail
road -yards, in Oakland, is in a very
much, cut-up Btate. Tracks are being
laid; In every direction and there are
two construction now at work
preparing that property for the open
ing of the road.- While the tract is
level there Is, much grading >to be done
because of the â¢ heavy fall from San
Pablo avenue to ' the bay shore.
Regular travel over this line will not
be opened until about the 1st of May.
The exact date for the opening of th.j
new line has not; been set, but it la
expected that the first passenger train
will be run at that time.. The people
of Oakland are preparing for a cele
bration when the event occurs.
There was no ceremony attendant
upon this trip. The train merely pulled
out of Oakland at 2 o'clock and ran
through to Point Richmond, returning
at 5 o'clock. The run was without
event, for the Stege crossing had been
tested from the Point Richmond side,
several cars loaded with steel being
run out upon the bridge to test its
strength.
There has been much delay in the
completion of this line.. First it was
difficult to get the steel work for the
overhead crossing at Stege, where the
Santa Fe. lines cross those of the South
ern Pacific. This bridge is a long one.
for it spans four tracks at this point.
The manufacturers did not deliver it
on time and this caused much delay.
Then came the wet weather, during
which time work upon the Vnain line^
has been practically suspended. But
to-day everything was completed and
the first Santa Fe train passed over the
line from Oakland and connected at
Point Richmond with the main line of
that road.
OAKLAND. March 16.â The first
train over the Santa Fe system between
Oakland and Point Richmond passed
over the line to-day. It was only u
construction train, but it marked the
completion of the line of the Santa Fe
system into Oakland and the beginning
of that railroad competition that has
been looked for so long.

Belle Herbert has begun an action
of divorce against Robert Herbert, al
leging desertion as her cause for ac
tion.
Because he lost $150 in an invest- j
ment, Fannie A. Cohen left Emanuel
Cohen, and to-day he was granted a
divorce on the ground of desertion. He
alleges that he had been in the habit
of giving his wife his earnings, but
that, seeing an opportunity to make a
turn in an investment, he took a
chance and lost. His unlucky venture
cost him his peace of mind and then
his wife. She made life very miserable
for him and finally left him. She
was given $25 a month alimony for the
support of their three children.
Benaiah Dunham was granted a di
vorce to-day by Judge Melvin on the
ground of cruelty from Sarah M. Dun
ham, who has been in Agnews Insane
Asylum for five years. The acts of al
leged cruelty were committed prior to
her commitment to the asylum. She
was in the habit of throwing things
at 'Dunham and making his life gen
erally miserable and to-day he was
given a divorce on that account.
Nicholas Karmen was given a di
vorce from Jessie Karmen on the
; ground of cruelty. He alleged that her
fondness for the society of other men
caused him much mental anguish.
Adeline Slros was awarded a decree
of divorce from Elzor Slros on the
ground of desertion and was given the
care of the minor children. They were
married many years ago and there are
six children, but two being under age.
Divorce, proceedings were instituted
by Annie Hoffschneider Curtis against
W\aldo Curtis on the ground of deser
tion. They were married in 1900 and
two years later, she alleges, he left
her.

United States Circuit Judge Morrow
yesterday overruled the demurrer of
the defendants in the suit brought by
the United States against W. K. Cole
and the Fidelity and Deposit Company
of Maryland and allowed the defend
| ants thirty days in which to file an an
i swer. The suit was brought to recover
I $20,000 on the bonds of Cole as caah
i ier of the branch Mint in San Fran
j Cisco in the partial restoration to the
i Government of $30,000, which sum
was judicially determined to have
been stolen by Walter N. Dimmick.
the chief clerk. The demurrer was on
the ground that the cashier of the
mint was not* an officer of the United
States ar " therefore was not civilly
responsible for the shortage.
Judge .Morrow called attention: to
a statute allowing th^ superintendent
of the Mint to require bonds from his
subordinates for the safe keeping of
the property in their charge. The
bond given by Cole. . however, was not
given to Superintendent Leach, but- to
the Government, and it is expected
that an interesting' legal question will
be raised at the trial. Â¦
The suit dismissed by Judge Mor

Marie Nightengale, ' the trained
nurse, who as the daughter of Pa
lagia Marie Kryzyanowksi contested
the latter's will and then compromised
her suit for $10,000, desires. once more
to become a party interested in the

for letters df administration upon the

that as Charles Rickman, who in
herited .under the disputed will and
I who paid the $10,000 to give up the
fight, has been removed from the posi
tion of executor of the will, some one
who has the interest of the estate at
heart should be given the task of car
ing for it.
The nurse's petition and also that of
Public Administrator M. J. Hynes

Kerrigan yesterday, but neither peti

mittee to consider the question. A new
system of water. mains was ordered to
be laid from the foot of the Sentinel to
the village. It will cost $2000. The
commission voted $1000 for clearing
away underbrush.
Dr. N. K. Foster, secretary of the

The motion was made chiefly on the

There promises to be Interesting go
ings-on next Tuesday in Judge Mo
gan's court, for Lola Hallett and Lillie
King have been notified to appear then
and there and explain what they mea"nt
by violently assaulting Marie Albert
o,ne night about a weekago in a'Bar-'
bary Coast, vaudeville cellar.- The cqiri
plainant alleges that she was .beaten
because . the manager, of the establish
ment, c-ne "Ji m" Hallett. had - devoted
more, attention .to' her than .was,-con
sidered proper by the defendant'^'who
"The fact that the goods were stolen
does not prove that this defendant stole
them." replied the Judge, "and you
must remember that his partner is not
now on- trial."
"Well, if this defendant didn't steal
the boilers I'd like to know how his
partner got hold of them?"
"I must plead Inability to enlighten
you," murmured the court.
"And the overcoat â if Lauricke didn't
steal that overcoat, who did?"
"You may search me," answered the
bench.
"Welli of all things," exclaimed Mrs.
Flores. "Here I am, just as sure as
I can be that Lauricke stole those boil
ers and that overcoat, and here he Is
likely to be discharced. Did any one
ever?"
"Can't answer: pass me," was the
Judge's wearily delivered response.
"Well, you won't let him go until I
see if I can't get some rnqre witnesses?"
inquired the lady.
' "I'll hold him till to-morrow," implied
the court; "and for your own benefit
I would advise you to be satisfied that
your prospective witnesses know some
thing about the case before you bring
them here."
Mrs. Sarah Flores of Fruitvale vig
orously attempted to convince Judge
Mogan that J. M. Lauricke, a tamale
and enchilada peddler, had stolen two
boilers and an overcc-at from among
the personal effects left by her father
when he was killed by a railroad train
January 29 last. January 30, the com
plainant averred Lauricke went to' the
family residence and purloined the
property described, but she failed to
produce any witnesses who had actual
ly seen the goods In the defendant's
possession, although she summoned
quite a number c-f persons to testify
on that point.
"Unless you can prove that this man
stole the boilers and the overcoat I
don't see how I can hold him," said
the Judge.
"What more proof do you want than
the fact that the property was stolen
and that the defendant's partner was
seen using the bailers at Ingleside?"
demanded the witness.
For soliciting alms from pedestrians
on Market street Charles Norton and
John Manning, strapping big vagrants,
were sent up for three months apiece
by Judge Conlan, and for a similar
offense John Collins was given just
double that dose by Judge Mogan. It
was shown that Collins made a special
ty of accosting women and insulting
them if they failed to respond to his
appeal for money. He looked more like
a shabby-genteel workman than a pro
fessional mendicant, and Police Officer
Jordan stated that the fellow was a
student of the art of "make-up."
TV. H. McFall, a railroad construc
tion hand, displayed a bandaged head
in substantiation of his complaint that
he had been smitten with a club wield
ed by W. A. Brown, a bartender in the
saloon at 911 Kearny Xsireet. Brown
did not deny the allegation, but plead
ed that the assault was justified by
the provocation, which consisted of the
complainant's refusal to pay for .a
drink which he had ordered and con
sumed. Besides, argued the mixologist,
he was exasperated by the conduct of
a man who was with McFall. These
pleadings were taken under considera
tion by Judge Conlan and judgment
will probably be handed down to-day.
In the Blue Book of San Francisco
there is no mention of the Diamond So
cial Club, nor is such an organization
alluded to in the San Francisco City
Directory, yet that it exists and has
made its beins felt in the vicinity of
Twenty-fourth and Castro streets was
proved yesterday before Judges Fritz
and Cabaniss, each of whom had a.
number of the members before him on
a charge of disturbing 1 the peace. The
defendants numbered a dozen and their
aged ranged from nine to fifteen yeais.
On the prison books they were reg
istered as* Charles McDonald, Fritz
Dirking Jr., Joseph Rind, Harry Han-
Ion, Charles Anderson, William ' John
son, F. K. Scofield. Neil McMahon, Wil
liam Connor, Thomas Matty and.
Thomas Pease.
Police Officers Bolton, Moltke and
Davey, who collaborated in the com
plaint, alleged that the Diamonds had
no regular place for meeting, .but most
ly congregated at Twenty- fourth and
Castro streets, inhere they executed the
ostensible objects of their fraternity by
casting stones at passing street cars",
j attaching empty tin cans to the cauda!
appendages of the neighborhood dogs
and pelting Inoffensive pedestrians
with garbage and uncomplimentary
language. That they were associated
for such purposes the Diamonds em
phatically and indignantly denied, de
claring that they were banded solely
for social intercourse, intellectual ad
vancement and other innocuous pur
suits.
"Then why were you arrested and
brought here?" Judge Cabaniss asked
the spokesnjan of the bunch of Dia
monds that glittered before him.
"Because," was the ingenuous an
swer, "some cops hates ter see kids
enjoy theirselves. We wasn't frowin'
no rocks at cars, or we wasn't tyin' no
cans ter no dogs' .tails, or we wasn't
chuckin' no insultery at soils w'en dese
bulls busted on us like a band of pirates
an' snaked us in. If dat's wot youse
| call justice, den I wants no more of it."
A murmur of approval from the other
Diamonds was suppressed by the
bailiff and the court continued the cases
until corroborative testimony can be
rounded up by the complaining police
men. Judge Fritz made, similar dis
posal of thÂ»Â» Diamonds assigned to him.
Daniel Valenzuela, 22 years ' of age,
said : he was a private, detective ! when
Judge Mogan inquired, as to, his .voca
tion,' and the "case was continued'two
, "Mary, you had better stay south of
the slot," said the Judge, and then he
gave her twenty-four hours', imprison
ment to enable her to get'rid of the ef
fects of her latest enthrallment. Â¦
Mary Bo wen dwells on Folsom streejt,
but the police records show that each
of her numerous arrests for vagrancy
was effected on" the Barbary Coast. In
explanation of this fact Mary : informed
Judge Mogan that she has a sister who
resides at the North End and that they
visit each other frequently. Mary is
passionately fond of music, and on sev
eral occasions while she was en route, to
her sister's home the strains of 'melody
wafting from the dance hall doors on the
Barbary Coast enthralled her to such an
extent that the police imagined she was
Intoxicated. . .
It was at a meeting held at 509Â»Â£
Bush street for the purpose of estab
lishing a fund to aid the Japanese Gov
ernment in its argument with Russia
that Kimo % was assaulted. The pro
ceedings opened with patriotism and
good-fellowship at fever heat, but as
orator after orator depicted in graphic
language the struggle of the Mikado's
forces to drive the Slav out of Man
churia the temper of the audience waxed
truculent, until chaos supplanted de
corum and blows were freely and In
discriminately interchanged. When
Kimo succeeded in extricating himself
from the howling, scratching and strik
ing mass of humanity he sought police
aid and had Fukushimi and Zarai ar
rested as his assailants.
Since the outbreak of hostilities be
tween Japan and Russia the warlike
spirit of some of the little brown men
residing in San Francisco has been
finding vent in illegal ways, and hardly
a day passes without one or. more of
them being punished for assault or dis
orderly conduct. In Judge Mogan's
court yesterday two of them were*fined
$100, apiece for furiously fighting on the
public Street, and another was given
ninety days in prison for brandishing
in threatening manner a knife that was
long and sharp enough to serve as a
sword, while Judge Conlan spent con
siderable time in futile endeavor to con
vince M. Kimo, who keeps an employ
ment agency at 122*4 Turk street, that
it was his duty to prosecute John
Fukushimi and H. Zarai, whom he had
arrested for assaulting him. Kimo had
sworn to a complaint charging his
compatriots with having violently as
sailed him, but when the case was
called in court he declared he knew
nothing at all about it. He was held
for perjury.
Xorah Slattery, who is burdened with
a penchant for stealing bedcoverings
from lodging-houses, was given five
months' imprisonment for purloining a
quilt from the rest for transients con
ducted by Mrs. Davis of Fourth street.
Judge Cabaniss prescribed the sentence
and gratuitously presented Norah with
a large chunk of counsel as to her fu
tore.
J. W.'Joy. who peddles coat hangers
for, a. livelihood and imbibes strong
waters for recreation, was given thirty
days for drunkenness and .disorderly
conduct by Judge Cabaniss. who ob
served that the prisoner's countenance
was not expressive of the feeling sig
nified by his surname. The defendant
pleaded that he is afflicted with deaf
ness, but the Judge failed to see how
aural weakness could logically be held
responsible for inebriety.
Louis Horner was caught in the act
of thrashing two able-bodied men at
Kearny and Jackson streets night be
fore last, yet when Louis appeared be
fcre Judge Mogan. yesterday he stated
that he recently came here from Cin
cinnati for his health, which Is so poor
as to incapacitate him for manual labor

Don't listen too long to the cry of "easy
terms" unless they are backed by good pianos.
Look for a piano house that can give you both
quality and financial accommodation. No firm
in San Francisco offers easier terms than Sher-
man, Clay & Co., and surely no one offers bet-
ter instruments nor sells for more reasonable
prices. Their stock is made up of Steinways
and eight other worthy makes from which you
can select a piano that will please at the price
you want to pay. Terms as low as $6 down

A CONTRACT has been awarded by the Sacra
mento County Horticultural Society for spraying
the neglected and :?ale infested trees within the
limits of the city of Sacramento. > The reason for this
action is that parasites in the urban foliage are a menace
to the horticultural interests in the country adjacent.
Bitter experiences in the earlier days^ofhortipulture
in California, havJe taught salutary Wessons. Various
forms of scales have attacked orange trees and the de
ciduous "orchards. Vigorous "measures have been taken
to save the trees from destruction. Spraying plants have
been devised. Large sums of money have been dis
bursed annually for prevention and for extermination.
Beneficial insects have been imported from Australia and
from European countries.; "The remedies have been ex
pensive, but have been proved to be of large advantage.
Incideutal"to the introduction -of scale destroyers and
the study of their habits, knowledge of a useful sort has
been acquired. It has been observed that the insects
imported to destroy the hosts or predation have speedily
increased in number from a few to millions., This last
mentioned fact has eventually pointed out the desira

to get a birdseye view of San Francisco in its every as
pect which could only, be duplicated by a trip across the
continent/; The San Francisco. building will be â¢ a more
potent advertising medium than a ten years' issue of
broadsides and pamphlets.
Besides the material gains which will accrue from the
presence of a striking exhibit at . St.! Louis civic L pride
ought to be a strong factor in bringing the collection of
funds to. a successful finish. When we had our- own
fair we were inspired to do our best by the fact that our
city harbored I its own display ; now that St. Louis has in
vited us to vie, with our sister cities of ;the Union, it
should be still more our. strong endeavor to make a
showing which cannot be beaten. Â¦
Li M. KING, the secretary of the committee of citi
zens who have in charge the management of San
â¢ Francisco's exhibit at the St. Louis exposition,
lias sent abroad appeals for the prompt payment of the
funds pledged for the installation and maintenanceof
the display. At present the committee has received in
cash from private sources something more than $12,000,
the municipality. has voted $15,000, while $50,000 is the
minimum sum required for the erection of the San Fran
cisco building and the proper placing of the exhibits.
Before, the first of next month the remaining $23,000
necessary to round out the sum must be pledged and in
so far as possible in the hands of the committee.
Every one who has the interests of the city at heart
should take a personal interest in the collection of this
fund for the expenses of our exhibit at the fair. This is
a unique opportunity which San Francisco hasâ this
privilege of having a building to house its separate dis
play/ 4 Situated upon the "model street" near the main

Mr. Gould, the English cartoonist, has
thus defined his method: "To hit hard
without giving offense. Directly a car
toon, becomes abusive it fails in its
effect. This is purely the English ideal.
In America the people like strong per

1st once expressed his surprise to me
at the mildness of English caricature.
He could not understand it until he
came over" here, 'when he soon found
that -the American style would not be
tolerated. Our people da not like bur 1 
lesque." There is no doubt that this
difference in taste Is a' phenomenon
which goes right Into the roots of na
tional character. It is worth the at
tention of psychologists and historians.
Why is American caricature cruel,
while English caricature is humane?
Doubtless American caricature has
been profoundly influenced by the Ger
man school, from Nast to Keppler, from
Keppler to Opper. But we must dig
deeper for the real explanatioij. Cruel
caricature" is a mark of political imma
turity, of raw civilization. France,
Germany and the United States are
still, in their political teens. We in
England have outgrown caricature and
other diseases ct political infancy. It
may be that we are senile; at any
rate, we are polite. It is true that we
are not yet so polite as the Chinese,
but we are creeping up.
Mr. -Gould is the politest caricaturist
who ever .lived. His favorite victim is

Mr. - Chamberlain at ' least a thousand

are good friends. Indeed, after the

Mr. Chamberlain wrote to him. saying
that he had been as much amused as
anybody, and serit..him his photograph,

BOOST is regarded as an interloping word in the
language and in some dictionaries is put down as
vulgar. It was originally in use principally by
small boys in the^days of the wagon road circus, when
they rose early in the morning and went far out on the
country road to see the show come in. There they took
to the trees and the boy who first began to climb had the
right to call on the others to boost him. He got the first
look at the elephant.
But whether the word is fellowshiped among the le
gitimate transitive verbs that are domesticated in the
dictionary it is a good and expressive term and is just
now the household word in Oakland. That city has* lost
a number of good opportunities because no one would
boost her, and -the elephant has frequently passed with
out being seen. Such an opportunity occurred and was
unused a few years ago when "the city refused to buy,
dirt cheap, 160 acres of land on the western border for
a real park that would be first seen by all travelers on the
railroad. That failure has cost the town dearly, since
, first impressions .determine the action â¢ of those upon
whom they are made, and millions of people passing the
front door' of Oakland and finding it filthy and unbeau
tiful have had no further interest in'the city..
Now a new project ison foot, not as complete as that'
which was unwisely rejected, but it is a beginning. It
will sweep and garnish the city to a desirable extent and
it should be adopted when the people have a chance to
vote on it. To secure this an organization of boosters
has been made with a grand high booster at the head.
The members are pledged to boost the bonding propo
sition and to silence all knockers. The City Council
seems to be a progressive body and to have the confi
dence of the boosters. Mr. Howard, chairman of the bond
committee, Addressing the assembled boosters, said: "It
is not so much a big city that we want, but whatever the
size let it be a good city. Good in all appointments and
good in all departments of government."
Given a proper location the city that adheres to that
idea and becomes a good city will also become a big city,
for it is the kind that is sought by people who have any
use for a city at all.
But few cities in the world have as many natural ad
vantages as Oakland. Its development should be sym
metrical and general in just proportion and in all parts.
If any part of the city have not all that it wants in the
present issue of improvement bonds let it get in and
boost and it will have its chance next time, which will
come soon when the good effects of the current boost be
come apparent!
The whole State is to be congratulated that at last
Oakland is aware that the circus is coming and is deter
mined to get boosted up where she will see the elephant.

liMncis Board of Accountancy.)
'C.i'vHti.t. l'jm. by Joseph B. Bowles.)
The profession of the public account
ant Is the product of the modern meth
ods of transacting business, arid also
of that keen competition which makes
itself felt in every line of trade and
commerce. It may be stated that the
public accountant stands in the same
rt-laticr. to all matters affecting the or-
BftxUzatitm and supervision of records
of accounts and costs that the architect
bean iu the erection of a building. As
ih<- architect must be equally familiar
v.ith the- construction of a cottage, a
hospital or a factor}', so the public ac
countant must have an intimate knowl
td.ge uf the best forms of accounts in
iiH classes of business, and when en-
K&gcd upon a critical examination of
Them must know where to expect to
firÂ»d the weak places where losses may
occur. It is not expected of the archi
tect that he should be a bricklayer or
a plumber, neither must the public ac
countant be necessarily expected to be
t.. bookkeeper in so far as' the mere
beeping of the records Is concerned or
the spt-cd with which he might add a
column of figures or make a given
number of postings. Like the architect,
Iho public accountant is a designer and
creator, but instead of designing build-
Ings lit organizes and creates systems
of accounts and costs, and from his
knowledge of the needs of his client he
obtains all the required information
from various sources with the mini
mum amount cf labor^ and brings it to
gether into concise arid valuable state
ments that any layman can under
hand and appreciate.
The rapid growth of this profession
in this country during the past few
years and its increasing appreciation
on the part of the public make it one
which should appeal to young men
who are naturally endowed with those
qualifications which constitute a public
accountant and who are In doubt as to
what line of work to enter upon. The
professions of law and medicine are al
leady overcrowded, the investment of
capital in a small business is becoming
daily more hazardous, so that the fact
that go few college men enter the pro
fusion of public accountancy is un
doubtedly due to its being one of com
paratively recent date and because they
are ignorant of the excellent opportu
nities that this field of work opens up.
The opportunities for success in this
l.rofession are, however, not due to
any less exercise of energy, applica
tion and study than in other profes
sions, but exist solely on account of
the many calls on the part of the
public for the highest class of service
that an accountant can give, this de
mand being in excess of the present
EUpplj. Mediocre or second rate abil
ity will no more contribute toward
success in this profession than in any
other line of work, but what is claim
ed is that, to men of ability the
chances of securing a comfortable in
come are more favorable than in lOther
professions. Furthermore, his train
ing fits him to occupy most profit
able and responsible positions outside
of the accountancy profession to a far
greater extent than in other profes
sions.
Having discussed briefly the oppor
tunities of the profession from a ma
terial standpoint, it may not be out
of place to speak a few words as to
the standing of a | public accountant
among his fellow men. Every young
man of ambition wishes to feel, and
rightly so. that he is entering upon a
business or profession which stands
high in the regard of his friends and
associates. For the profession of ac
countanancy as it is to-day no apolo
pries are necessary. The relation which
exists between the public accountant
and his client is a personal one. in
volving on the part of the former an
intimate knowledge of his client's
most private affairs. The public ac
countant must therefore have a repu
tation above reproach to be worthy
c<f the confidences reposed in him.
Furthermore, the .work which an ac
rountant is employed to perform re
quires a higher order of skill and
aliility than the man of mediocre at
tainments could cope with. Therefore
both as regards personal character
and brain capacity, only the best of
*:ich is good enough for the account
ant vr^ia would be successful.
The meaning ot the term public as a
prefix to the Â¦ name accountant has
dlten puzzled those who have not had
Its cause explained, and a few words
on this subject will further elucidate
the duties of the public accountant.
One of the most important functions
ci the accour.lant and auditor is to cer

nection with Japan, is not only dis
tressed, but likewise dismayed, for h&
realizes that the war In Manchuria
and Korea entails a temporary efface
ment of Muscovite influence In the
Balkans, which redounds to the ad
vantage of Austria, and while the
Padishah dislikes the Russians, yet he
hates and fears the Austrians far more
bitterly. This is due to. the fact that
he realizes that the Czar and his peo
ple now desire above everythlnr else
the maintenance of the statu3 quo in
the Balkans, and are strongly averse
to either the creation of an independ
ent Macedonia or the annexation- of
the latter to Bulgaria.
Russia has found to her cost that
transformation of the Christian prov
inces of the Sublime Porte into more
or less independent states is not con
ducive to her polltlclal interests.
Roumania, Servia and Bulgaria all owe
their liberation from Ottoman^ thxall
dom to Russia, and in all three of
these Countries she is regarded to-day
with sentiments of hostility, and ex
periences difficulty In making her in
fluence felt in their capitals. The Czar
is not in sympathy with Macedonian
nationalist aspiration. He does not want
a Macedonia that is independent or
the predominant factor in a union be
tween her and Bulgaria. Nor dcies ha
want an independent Armenia, and it
was because he discovered that the
vast property of the Armenian church
in Russia was being employed to pro
mote the nationalist aspirations of the
Armenians in favor of an independent
Armenia in Turkey that he seized the
entire estate in question, so as to as
sure himself that the revenue should
only be employed for strictly educa
tional and ecclesiastical purposes and
not for political and revolutionary
propoganda.
In our view this is a vain theory. The municipal law
of the United States has exclusive jurisdiction here. Any
act that it forbids is legally preventable. To assume that
an act forbidden by law when done udder an American
charter cannot be forbidden when sheltered ! by a for
eign charter is to assume that the constitution itself can
be set aside by such charter. This is equivalent to say
ing that our whole system of government is destructible
by such pr.ocess. If foreign municipal law take prece
dence over our own on our own soil our Government is
without vigor or authority.
How the issue may arise cannot now be foreseen. It
may have to wait for an overt act referring to the foreign
charter as its authority, or the roads merged by such
charter may be denied the right of joint operation under
it, and by the proper writ be compelled to replace their
stocks in the possession of individual stockholders who
can be forbidden to exchange them for the certificates of
the foreign corporation, which may be outlawed as evi
dences of the ownership of the property. But however the
issue may appear, it is plain that American municipal law
will remain the supreme law of the land and incapable
of substitution by any extraterritorial authority what
ever.
Of course Messrs. Hill and Morgan dislike to surren
der a power which they grasped at such great cost. It is
not forgotten that the Northern Pacific and Burlington
stocks were secured by them at enormous prices, which
they had to pay to secure majority control of the two
roads necessary to make the merger and to make it ef
fective. They were advised by the ablest lawyers in the
country that an attack could only come from the State
courts, and when Governor Van Sant ordered the Attor
ney General of Minnesota to begin an action in the
courts of that State they saw an easy victory, and it
came. But when President Roosevelt ordered an action
in the Federal courts they faced a more difficult propo
sition. The people may be assured now that the re
sources of Federal law are not exhausted and will be
found quite equal to any difficulty that is presented by
the Canadian charter.
IT is announced that the managers of the Northern Se
curities Company applied for and obtained a Cana
dian charter immediately after Governor Van .Sant
began the Minnesota suit against the merger in, 1902. It
is stated that this Canadian charter covers operations in
Canada and the United. States. . ,
The Supreme Court, in passing upon the constitution
ality of the interstate commerce law, decided that Con
gress had the power to control interstate commerce by
such a law. The constitution says: "The Congress shall
have j)o\ver to regulate commerce with foreign nations
between the States and with Indian tribes."
When the interstate commerce law was before Con
gress it was objected to as an improper and excessive
exercise of this power, inasmuch as it proposed that
Congress should provide for the fixing or regulation of
rates of transportation. Senator Bayard made a very
able argument against the bill on that ground,. claiming
that regulation did not mean interference with rates.
He used the impossibility of regulating . international
rates of transportation as proof that such power did not
reside in Congress, because the regulation must relate
to the same things in all the particulars of interstate, in
ternational and tribal commerce.
It was believed that his argument was a correct state
ment of constitutional principles, butthe Supreme Count
swept it away by including transportation among the in
cidents of commerce, and the most important of them
all, and by challenging the opponents of the law to file
a bill of the particulars in which Congress could act in
regulating commerce if transportation were left out.
> With no power over transportation commerce is left
at the mercy of corporations engaged in that business.
They could so arrange rates as to entirely prohibit any
feature of interstate commerce. It would be at once
admitted that the Government would have power to in
terfere in such a case, and its interference must be di
rected to removal of the obstruction. As this obstruc
tion would be found in the rate of transportation its re
moval, of necessity, must be in "the form of regulating
rates. So the Senator's view of the law evaporated in
the application of the power of Congress to protect and
regulate commerce between the States.
These principles are applied by the court ih the merger
decision. This application need not wait for an overt
act, but is aimed at the power to commit such an act.
The existence of such a power is an inchoate offense,
which the courts will prevent by destroying the power to
commit it.
The court having invalidated the American charter,
because it implies power to do something in violation of
the law, will now be presented with a very interesting
phase of the question if an attempt be made to use the
prohibited power under a foreign charter. The Canadian
incorporation has been secured seemingly with the idea
that operation under it cannot be reached by an Ameri
can court!" J& X5. V t*
Prison-keeper Murphy was making
the rounds about 3 a. m. and discov
ered the morose Jackson in the act of
elevating himself from the floor by
means of a handkerchief tied one end
around his neck and the other to one
of the cell bars. Assisting, him to his
elevated'position was the other drunk,
never a smile and with the
philanthropic expression of a Car
negie on his face. In response to the
prison guard's question as to what he
was trying to do, the other Inebriate
responded calmly that "the coon
wanted to hang himself and he was
helping him out." Prison-keeper Mur
phy does not believe in the "helping
hand" policy in such an instance and,
lecturing the two inebriated gentle
men on "the evils of suicide as a
means of occupation," he departed
with a smile.
Mistah Jackson is,a Pullman car
porter who travels across the hot
sands of Nevada in the pursuit of his
vocation and a few honest dollars.
Over in Nevada, where the wild wind
blows and the lone coyote howls, the
speedy atmosphere leaves behind it a
trail of parched throats. Stations are
few and far between and the stops so
brief that the colored eentlemen on
the cars get little chance to hit an
oasis.
Mistah Jackson, when he lays over
in San Francisco after a tiresome run,
generally goes out to celebrate. The
peculiar thing about Jackson is that
on these times he becomes intensely
melancholy. One night somehow or
other Mistah Jackson was escorted to
the Hall of Justice in a condition sim
'ilar -to that of a wet sponge. The
prison-keeper placed him in a cell
along with another celebrity of the
same brand and left him to repose in
the peaceful solitude of the "pen."
Jackson seemed to take his forced
lodging much to heart and objected
; strenuously at being placed in the lat
: ticed room. ,
The Helping Hand.
A CANADIAN MERGER.
To the young man who may desire
to prepare himself for this profes'sion
a few words will be in place as to the
qualifications which are not obtained
by study, but which rather form a
part of his character. It is, of course,
assumed that the candidate has a na
tural love of figures and that he is well
versed in mathematics, and preferably
also in algebra and geometry as a
training to his reasoning faculties. To
these qualifications should be added a
large fund of common sense, caution
and patience, while accuracy in his
calculations and modes of thought and^
reasoning are absolutely essential.
The man who will accept as correct
the figures as they appear on books of
accounts because they contain no
clerical error or who will too readily
accept explanations given without
further investigation will never suc
ceed as an auditor. It is necessary to
know the reason of every step taken
and once satisfied that a given result
fs the true one, the accountant should
have the courage to stand by it.
In addition ' to the study of text
books and those natural qualifications
which have been referred to above,
experience must be gained by actual
work in an accountant's office. In no
other manner can any man prepare
himself for those duties and respon
sibilites which he will later be called
upon to bear after he has duly quali
fied as a certified public accountant.
During this period of apprenticeship
in the profession, as it may be termed,
he will be called upon to perform a
considerable amount of routine work,
which at times may appear irksome,
but which will give him a thorough
foundation in the. principles of ac
counting and auditing.
In conclusion nothing better can be
quoted than the following paragraph
out of Dicksee's "Work on Auditing":
"Accountancy is a profession calling:
for a width and variety of knowledge
to which no man has yet set a limit;
the foremost accountants are not
ashamed to say that, like Epami
nondas, they 'learn something in addi
tion every day'; let us therefore see
no Ehamp in following their example."
The students of law or medicine
must pass examinations successfully
before they practice as lawyers or
doctors, so ' that the public may be
protected against those who are un
qualified, hence the value of placing
the public accountant on the same
footing is too obvious for further com
ment, except to state that the effect of
this law is to give to the certified pub
lic accountant a professional stand
ing which very properly should in
crease his responsibilities.
Realizing the necessity of some means
by which the public can discriminate
between the qualified public accountant
and the unqualified public accountant,
the Legislatures of the States of New
York. Pennsylvania. Illinois, Maryland.
California and Washington have all
passed laws creating the title of certi
fied public accountant and granting
same upon due examination. The law*
are not restrictive in their character,
re they do not prevent any person from
practicing as a public accountant, ex
cept that only he who has duly passed
the examination can term himself "cer
tified public accountant," or use the
abbreviation "C. P. A." after his name.
In the State of Illinois the University
of Illinois is the body that is empow
ered to hold examinations and grant
decrees; the qualifications being that
the applicant must be a citizen of the
United States or have declared his in
tention of Incoming a citizen, and be
over the age of 21; he must have re
ceived a high school education or its
equivalent, and be a man of good moral
character. He must also successfully
pass examinations on the following
subjects: "Practical accounting,"
"theory of accounts," "auditing" and
"commercial law."
finitely more extensive than that which
may be exercised by an unqualified
medical practitioner. The latter, if he
be the possessor of an extensile prac
tice, may poison a hundred or so pa
tients in the course of his career; but
the former can. while merely confining
his attention .to the affairs of one un
dertaking, readily accomplish the ruin
of tens of thousands in a much shorter
period."
ficial insect that has been imported into California, has
an appetite for more than one particular sort of food.
Without that sole desideratum it must starve. Therefore
it follows that the limit to the multitudes of insect pest
destroyers, in the war of bug against bug, is fixed abso
lutely by the quantity of the scales that supply an .exclu
sive diet. Millions of beneficial insects that continue to
exist, therefore, necessarily imply millions of dangerous
scales. Place a colony of the imported insect friends of
the horticulturist in any infested -orchard and they will
soon expand the scope of their operations and seek new
fields to conquer, as Alexander did. The scales as cer
tainly extend the areas of their baneful operations.
Now it is clear that if the scales increase to millions
in the country the incitements to fecundity in .the imme
diate urban neighborhood are existent. The cities may
become centers of infection by means of* neglected
growths.. Quarantine laws against the introduction - of
trees and fruits guard only the frontiers. California's
interior cities are situated in the heart of fruitful sections.
Sacramento is pioneering the way r in the matter of
cleansing its own trees. Other communities will find it
to their advantage to look with the keen glance of
science to their yards and .streets in search of insect
pests. The enduring thrift of the country surrounding
them is the basis of their own lasting prosperity. Let
all trees in interior cities that are the favorite habitat of
scales be inspected and let other necessary action follow.

â WASHINGTON. March 16. â The
Dietrich investigating committee re
sumed its inquiry into the charge*
against Senator Dieirich to-day.
J. JR. Wright, formerly a janitor in
the postoffice at Hastings, was called
to show the exorbitant charges in con
nection with the remo%-al of the old
postofflce fixtures from the Garbling
to the Dietrich building. The witness
stated he knew nothing about the
exorbitant charges, although the sum
mary furnished by the District Attor
ney stated that the witness would tes
tify to frauds in connection with the
removal. Wright stated he knew of
no frauds or misdoings of any one
connected with the. removal of the
postoffice at Hastings. He said that
he had a talk with Leopold Hahn after
his return from Omaha and that Hahn
had said he would get even with
Fisher (who was appointed post
master) If It took ten years and
510,000.
Affidavits of Alexander Campbell of
McCook, Nebr., and Dr. John Cook of
Hastings, now deceased, were offered
in evidence by Senator Dietrich's at
torney. These affidavits deny certain
conversations said to have taken place
between Hahn and Dr. Cook regard-
Ing the sale of the postoffice by Sena
tor Dietrich.
Senator Dietrich then offered a
statement of his connection with the
Hastings postoffice, together with
checks, deed of the Dietrich property,
passbooks of the bank where his
daughter keeps her account and other
matters bearing on the case. .
This closed the hearing so far as
the witnesses in attendance were con
cerned and they were discharged. The
PARIS, March 16. â The case of the
republic of Colombia against the Pan
ama Canal Company to prevent the
transfer of the tatter's concession to
the United States was resumed to-day
bÂ«fore the first tribunal of the Seise.
The former president of the tribunal,
Maitre Dubuit, continued his argument
In behalf of the company's right to sell
its concession to the United States.
"The initiative of these negotiations
for the sale did cot come from os, but
from the Government ot Colombia," ex
claimed Dubuit. Counsel farther as
serted that the republic of Panama was
fully organized as a sovereign state. In
closing Dubuit made the following sig
nificant query:
"Why should we solicit your consent
when your authority ceased to exist?
Let us speak frankly. It Is a question
of price, is It not? And it is bÂ«st that
we do not discuss that branch of tha
Question."
Maitre Guillaumin. representing Bo
naparte "Wise, the original concession
aire, pointed out to the court that the
civil tribunal of the Seine decided
March 15, 1802. that the company could
make the transfer, but limited the time
till March 4. 1903. He Insisted that this
decision prevented the transfer to the
United States after the latter date.
Adjourned until to-morrow.
Dubuit's statement that Colombia's
consent to the transfer was "a Question
of price" was much commented upon.
San Francisco will elect to the next
Legislature eighteen Assemblymen and
six Senators. The outgoing State Sen
ators are Joseph M. Plunkett, Seven
teenth District; Richard J. Welch,
Nineteenth; Edward I. Wolfe, Twenty
first; John G. Tyrrell. Twenty-third,
and John H. Nelson, Twenty-fifth.
George H. Williams, Twenty-fourth,
who was elected in 1902 to serve for
four years, died July 17, 1903, and at
the next election a Senator will be
chosen to fill the unexpired term.
The holdover State Senators from
San Francisco are Harry Bunkers
(Dem.), Eighteenth District; Frank
French (Rep.), Twentieth, and Hamil
ton A. Bauer (Rep.), Twenty-second
District. Senator Wolfe is in the field
as a candidate for re.nomination. Sen
ator Nelson is accredited* with an am
bition to extend his "career as a states
man. Senator Welch, chief wharfinger
of the harbor of San Francisco, has
not declared his desire to enter the
contest for renomination to the Sen
ate, but he has a strong following in
the district. There, is talk of giving
the Republican nomination in the
Twenty-third District to George R.
Keane. the. secretary of the Mayor.
Thomas Lindsay and Martin Brady are
mentioned as aspirants to fill the va
cancy in the Twenty-fourth District.
In the Seventeenth District, now repre
sented by Joseph M. Plunkett (Dem.),
there is some talk of placing Barney
Conlan on the Republican ticket.
POLITICIANS NOT IDLE.
There will be the usual crop of
aspirants to represent the city in the
Assembly. Candidates for the United
States Senate are not taking an active
part In the preliminary agitation. Local
politicians who are ever on the alert
to get control of a bunch of legislators
are not Idle. In their estimation the
election of a United States Senator is
only an incident of the legislative ses
sion. The events apply to legislation
affecting corporations and the liquor
traffic
In the readjustment of the Sena
torial districts under the apportion
ment which went into effect January
1, 1902, the counties of Napa and So
lano, comprise the Fifth Senatorial
District. Robert Corlett of Napa, who
was elected in 1900 to represent the
old Seventh District (Xapa and Lake)
Is In the field as a candidate for Re
publican nomination in the new dis
trict. Word comes from Vallejo that
John J. Luchsinger of Vallejo, who
represented Solano County when that
county alone comprised the Ninth
Senatorial District, Is not in the race
for further legislative honors, but his
retirement from the field clears the
way for the candidacy of Benjamin P.
Rush of Suisun. Vallejo has had the
Senatorship for eight years, and now it
Is claimed that the northern end of
the county should be recognized. In
the Solano calculations Napa County
sentiment is not taken Into considera
tion, as the delegation from the former
county in the nominating convention
will be the dominating power. Mr.
Rush Is president of the State Agricul
tural Society.
CONTRA COSTA VS. MARIN.
There is gossip in political circles to
the effect that Contra Costa County
Republicans do not intend to give the
right of way to Marin County in the
selection of a Senator to represent the
new Ninth District. It is claimed that
Marin County, uilder the old alternate
system, has had the Senator for four
teen out of the past twenty years.
Marin. it is asserted, gains the advan
tage by electing a Democrat from
that county when it is Contra Costa's
turn to name the Republican candi
date. According to the alternate plan
the Republicans of Marin are entitled
in this campaign to name the candi
date of the party for State Senator.
Four years ago Contra Costa Republi
cans named Charles M. Belshaw, but
Marin County, which is accounted Re
publican by at least 500 majority, gave
J. H. Wllkins. Belshaw's Demo
cratic opponent. 162 majority. Ma
rin County Republican aspirants
for the coming Senatorial nomi
nation are General John H. Dick
inson. E. C. Chapman and E. B. Mar
tinelli. The Contra Costa delegation
Â¦will have the power to control the
nomination, and the power may be
used to give Charles M. Belshaw the
prize.
The voters next November may be
called upon to elect an Associate Jus
tice of the Supreme Court. Jackson
Temple (D.), who was elected for a
term ending January, 1907, died De
cember 26. 1902, and Governor Gage
filled the vacancy on the bench by the
appointment on January 5, 1903, of
William G. Lorigan. who was then
Judge of the Superior Court, Santa
Clara County.
VIGO, Spain, March 16. â At 9:30
o'clock this morning King Alfonso and
Emperor "WiUiam went aboard the
Spanish gunboat . Vasco Xunez de
Balboa, which weighed anchor, and
proceeded to review the Spanish war
ships. As the Vasco Nunez de Balboa
passed the Spanish battleship Pelayo
and the dispatch boat Urania both ves
sels fired salutes. The Palayo's band
played the German national anthem
and the sailors who manned the sides
cheered the two monarchs. The Vasco
Nunez de Balboa was followed by more
than thirty steamers. After the review
the two rulers were rowed to the Span
ish royal yacht Giralda for lunch. At
the luncheon Emperor William ap
pointed King Alfonso an Admiral In
the German navy. There were no
toasts proposed. Afterward the Em
peror conferred the Order of, the Black
Eagle on the captains of the Pelayo,
the Giralda and the Vasco' Nunez de
Balboa. The monarchs conferred for
an hour and a half in the saloon of -the
Giralda. Â¦;. .J
Emperor William to-day sailed for
Gibraltar on board the steamer Koenlg
Albert and was accompanied on that
vessel by King Alfonso until outside
Spanish waters.
. An authenticated copy of the will
of Frances H. Lowndes, who died re
cently In London, was filed here yes
terday. The devisee's are F. L. and D.
V. Lowndes, sons of deceased, and Ger
trude Morrisey and Theodora Find
ley, her daughters. Each of the son*
is bequeathed $50,000 In cash and one
fourth oi the residue. The daugh
ters divide the remainder.
, Mrs. 'Lowndes* Sons Enriched.
BERLIN., March 15. â Letters from
German South Africa have arrived
here giving details of the brutal treat
ment of German settlers, 113 of whom
were killed outright or tortured to
death in the district of Okahandja
alone. Women dismembered and with
pieces of their bodies nailed to the
doors of houses and bodies mutilated
left to die slowly were frequent spec
tacles. The expeditionary columns on
coming in sight of a farmer's house
would see the heads of its occupants
fastened to the roof.
These sights appear to have excited
the rage of the soldiers. The letters
express longing for revenge and a de
termination, as one writer says, to "kill
everything black." That causes some
papers to urge the Government to tele
graph instructions to Colonel Leut
wein, the Governor of Southwest
Africa, that he order the soldiers to
restrain themselves and conduct the
war in a civilized raaner. Colonel
Leutwein himself comes in for criti
cism, as it is alleged he left insufficient
numbers of troops in the exposed dis
tricts and was misled by the temper of
the natives, having frequently had at
his own table chiefs who are now In
rebellion and who are wearing dtcora
tions and swords of honor bestowed
upon them by the Governor in behalf
of the Emperor. The Tageblatt Inti
mates that Colonel Leutwetn will be
recalled.

According to a Berne newspaper a
surprising number of the Russian stu
dents at Swiss universities are mar
ried. : . .
Favorite players are ekeing out a
precarious existence these days. Six
straight choices had their pictures
turned toward the wall and the book-,
maker who did not collect something
for himself must needs be a clumsy
artist with the chalk and chamois.
Buxton did ride with some show of
animation on Assessment, landing the
gelding first for the opening event at
odds of 9 to 1. Rustic Girl, backed
from 20 down to 12, made all the run
ning and. only lost the decision by a
head. Jack Martin 'gave the favorite,
Young Morello, a vigorous ride, but
could finish no closer up than third.
Educate had speed, but found the
route too far. Argot, the second choice,
quit early. Â¦
,J.,T. Sheehan had the honor of pilot
ing Zenonian, the odds-on favorite for
the Futurity sprint following, and did
it with as much skill as a Chinese
â¢laundryrnan would display handling a
mule pack train with a jerk line. First
into the, stretch,; he was" seized with
short odds fright, when Vanderbout,
astride Box Elder, closed on his mount.
Then, throwing away the reins and
turning his horse's head loose, he drew
the whip. Vanderbout didn't do much
better, but lacks experience. . In the
interim Jack , Martin slipped through
on the rail with Inspector Munro less
than a furlong away, winning ridden
! out by. a couple of lengths. The favor
ite was a poor third.
ROLLICK DOWNS. CRISS CROSS.
.Sheehan redeemed himself,' however,
Modicum, the Burns handicap win
ner, lost the $.1000 handicap over onS
and an eighth miles at Oakland track
yesterday after it looked as if his
number must be flashed first. He was
ridden by Mountain and in the bet
ting closed favorite-over Elliott and
the McAlester entry, Horatius and
Bombardier.
Mountain took Modicum out in
front at the start and the only one to
prove at all troublesome was Key
note, a hundred-pounder, which was
not'thoroughly subdued until the pad
dock was almost reached.
With "Doc" Kyle's horse out of th>Â»
way things looked bright for the fa
vorite, when suddenly Iva Powell
came from the suburbs with Horatius.
The latter caught the pacemaker leg
weary and won cleverly by nearly a
length. Away from the barrier poor
ly, Elliott finished a fair third.
If C. Smith on Keynote had dis
played any judgment in picking his
way and had taken the' dryer going
out from the rail his mount would in
all likelihood have been returned the
winner. Leader was slow to leave the
barrier and Martin apparently made
no effort to persevere with him.
SIX CHOICES LOSE.
Hello! Oh, yea-Keegan. Didn't
recognize your voice since you've had
your collars lowered two stories.
What's. that you say? Why yes, that's
the same Rustic Girl that started on
March 7. No trouble at all. Good-by.
Twenty-three bookmakers cut In
yesterday.
Jimmy Jackson and his crew left for
Memphis last evening. Counsellor Mills
Capps and Ed Noel, the crack bowler,
will be greatly missed from turf circles.
The stewards reinstated Hiram Pierca
yesterday. Hiram grew obstreperous
one day at Ingleside and struck H.
NOTES OP THE TRACK.
In the next by riding a well-judged race
on the 12 to 1 shot Rollick and down
ing Criss Cross half a length. The lat
ter was best and should have won had
Mountain used more, discretion in
escaping the deep footing. Buxton's
piloting of Galanthus, the favorite,
caused that rider to fall In for much
adverse criticism. He assuredly saved
no ground and then the Coffey entry
ran a fair third. Quiz II played a one
night stand out in front before retiring.
Billy Matjrane's little horse, 'Hand
press, ruled a pronounced favorite for
the fifth race, but more than met his
equal In First Chip. The odds about
the latter receded from 2 to 1 to 16. to u.
and he had the race won almost from
the first jump. Handpress, under
Daly's persuasive urging, swerved bad
ly the last eighth and then succeeded
in taking the place from Flaneur. Sir
Preston showed some speed early" In
the race.
I San Francisco will have a shade the
worst of the games with Chicago, be
cause inclement weather has prevented
the right sort of training, but gritty
Jimmy Whalen thinks he will be able
to hold the big leaguers down.
In view of the expense . of the trip
Manager Harris has decided to charge
a 50-cent admission at these two games
only, with an extra tariff of 25 cents
for the grand stand. During the reg
ular season, however, the old rate of
25 cents will prevail. 1
Jim Morley thinks the Chicago Na
tional League team is the fastest bunch
of ball players he ever saw, and he
says the fans have a treat in store
on Saturday and Sunday, when the
Eastern aggregation lines up at Recre
< ation Park for a couple of exhibition
games with the club that will repre
! sent San Francises in the Coast
League.
Accordin& to Morley, Chicago- looks
like a pennant winner to him. He says
the infield is fast and snappy and that
l*he outfield can cover as much ground
{ as any three men he ever saw play-
I ing the positions. Selee has Kling. con
sidered to be the best catcher in the
business when all things are consid
ered, with O'Neill as change backstop.
Chance, the Fresno giant, has adapted
himself to the first sack and .is her
alded as one of the best men in the
I country at that important position.
Evers. Casey and Tinker are the other
infielders. McCarthy, Slagle and' Jones
comprise the outfield, a great staff
of young pitchers with Enough expe
rience to take them out of the experi
mental class completes the team. -

TO PLAY HERE
VETERAN ENGLISH POLOIST. "WHO. THOUGH INJURED EARLY IN THE GAME j
VEPTERDAT. PLAYED THROUGHOUT THE CONTEST WITH INDOMITABLE
SPIRIT IN* INTERNATIONAL MATCH AT BURLINGAME COUNTRY CLUB.
A new ball was thrown In and
Mackey carried it swiftly toward the
Burlingame goal. It was stopped by
Hobart, who ran it up the field again.
The ponies became, exhausted and it
became necessary to change, two min
utes being allowed for this. They were
at it again, every player doing" his
duty in a perfect frenzy. v In the
midst of a mixup in front of the Eng
lishmen's goal Duval drove the ball
between the posts, , thus winning the
game for the Burlingame clubmen. A
mighty cheer went up from the spec
tators around the field, and Messrs.
Duval and Hobart were given an ova
tion when .they returned to the club
stand. Three cheers were, given for
the winning team, and the gallant
losers were also cheered. -Captain
Haig and Walter Hobart played bril
liantly. R. M. Tobin also distinguished
himself, especially by riding off Cap
tain Haig more successfully than has
been done previously this season. 5
This made three successive goals
for the English team," and the Bur
lingame sympathizers began to lose
heart. The English visitors among
the spectators were elated, but their
enthusiasm was quickly dampened by
John Lawson, who scored for the Bur
lingame, again making the score' a tie.
The timekeeper's bell sounded the end
of the game. Without stopping to
change poniea an extra period was
started. The play "was the fiercest of
the entire game for a few moments,
when -the ball was. broken.
The excitement was intense at the
opening of the sixth period. The Eng
lishmen ran the ball down the field to
their opponents' goal and Walter Ho
bart, after a desperate struggle, drove
the ball outside for a "safety." In
the free stroke for goal which followed
Captain Haig scored for the English
team, making the visitors one goal to
the good.
. SCORE IS TIED.
F. J. Mackey, the veteran of the Eng
lish team, was struck on the right
hand early in the first period and the
wound bled profusely. While this must
have been a great handicap to him,
he pluckily played .throughout the en
tire game and was in the midst of
nearly every scrimmage.
. For -.the first half of the game the
Burlingame men led and at the end
of the fourth period they looked to be
sure winners, the score being five goals
to three in their favor. At the begin
ning of the fifth period the English
players rode brilliantly and kept the
ball almost continually around their
opponent's goal. Twice In succession
Duval by hard riding and sure strokes
drove the ball out from almost be
tween the goal posts. Captain Haig,
the herculean Englishman, with some
of his marvelous strokes scored two
goals rapidly, the period ending with
the score a tie. 1 ,
The pololsts of the Burllngame Coun
try Club carried o/C the honors yes
terday at Burlingame In the annual
International match with the Hurllng
ham team from England. It was pro
nounced the most exciting game ever
witnessed at Burlingame and was
played with the utmost dash and aban
don by the members of both teams.
At the end of the sixth period the score
was a tie, each side having made seven
goals. An extra -period was ordered,
and Charles Raoul-Duval scored a goal,
which meant that the honors of the
day went to the Burlingame men. The
struggle until this goal was scored was
remarkable for the clever play on both
sides and was greeted with a volume
of applause rarely heard at a polo
match. The teams were made up of
the following players:

Britt'a surplus energy and constant
cheerfulness while undergoing hia
daily training grind have impressed all
visitors to the little boxer's camp, and
they have run \ Into the thousands.
Young Corbett enjoys the fame of be
ing an Inimitable Josher along with
that of champion of his class, but
Britt, too, hath a merry wit that: la
more than eighteen karats original.
His friends are confident that should
.Young Corbett' elect to turn loose a
volley of sarcastic jolts at Jimmy
when the fray waxes fiercely, as Terry
McGovern believes the Denverite will,
the stocky champion will receive as
good as he sends.
Britt went on the. road yesterday
morning, and in the afternoon sacri
ficed perspiration and weight in a two
hour turn In his gymnasium with the
skipping rope, dumb-bells, punching
bag and with Frank Rafael. He
wrestled with the latter, and the way
the pair tugged arid shjoved was fierce
to gaze upon. , ,
"Next week," said Britt. "I will get
rid of the weight I am^carrylngover
the stipulated 130 pounds. To-day I
weighed about 135. but I have been
seesawing between that figure and 133
pounds for some days and I am, not
worried. I have never felt better than
I do now, and three pounds subtracted
will occasion me no loss of energy, I
am certain.".
Happy, and hovering between 135 and
133 pounds, is Jimmy Britt's present
condition. Next week the star of Cali
fornia's ring celebrities will settle
down under the watchful eyes of his
trainer. Spider Kelly, to disposing of
his extra weight. Jimmy asserts he will
not have to do the Shylock act in ac
complishing it.
HRITT IS HAPPY.
When the first round was finished
along came Billy Otts, fortified with a
big chest protector.. The way Otts
was treated was not at all gentleman
ly. Corbett kept rushing him all the
time and took special delight in get
ting into clinches and then doine the
rough house act. When he was fin
ished with Otts-he called upon Attell
again and alternated with the pair
for three fast and lengthy rounds.
He paid a whole lot of attention to
the clinches and showed his partners
no mercy when breaking away. * He
would bring his right over fast and
catch his opponent on the jaw at" an
opportune moment and when either of
them would turn the trick on him he
seemed think it was great fun.
When he had completed his boxing
stunts the little fellow was perspiring,
but was still fresh, while both his
sparring partners were winded. This
was one of the busiest days Corbett
has spent for some time.
He practiced all his fancy punches
and his clever swings on this till it
was ready to burst from the severe
strain. Then Monte Attell was called
out to go a few. Corbett started in
at his little sparring partner and rush
ed him all around the ring. He never
let up for. a second and was ready, to
take two punches in order to put in
a good one to the body, the kind he
figures to stop Britt with.
As soon as he got started they
could not stop him. He roughed it
from the start and kept up a fast
pace till it was all over. He started
in at the weight machine f and after
pulling this around for about fifteen
minutes he commenced at the big
swinging, bag. That got an awful beat
ing for about the same length* of time
and then the punching bag received a
fair share of the champ's time. *
The battalions of sportsmen who ex
pect to wager a little on the Corbett-
Britt fight lined up yesterday and sur
veyed the situation. The outcome was
that the Corbett adherents offered to
bet 100 to 70 an indefinite number of
times on the chances of the feather
weight champion.
This was apparently higher than the
Britt men wanted to go. the latter
thinking the odds should be 100 to, 60.
The result was a deadlock for the time
being. Some private wagers have been
made, one gentleman betting $2000 on
Corbett against $1600 qn Britt. It is
not expected Corbett's friends will get
much money at that price.
It was rough house day at Camp Cor
bett yesterday, and consequently the,
wee champion must have taken off a
few pounds of that superfluous weight.
Although the weather was not hot, Cor
bett forced; the perspiration to ooze
through the pores of his skin for a
fare ye well. He finished up his day's
work looking -fit for action.
The customary run in the morning
along the road was an extra long one
and It was fast and strenuous. The
champion was not in any particular
hurry to get busy in the gymnasium
and the big crowd that gathered at
the tavern had to wait around and
watch the champion phone.to the book
makers and loll around till he got good
and ready to enter upon his afternoon's
work, which was about 3:30 o'clock.

Policeman Paul J. Butler and Stella
Butler, his wife, are not a happy pair,
according to a complaint for divorce
filed yesterday by Mrs. Butler. She
asks for a decree on the ground of
cruelty, and in support of her charge
makes many allegations that go to
show that ever since their marriage in
August, 1901, they have not had a very
peaceful existence.
j To commence with Mrs. Butler
charges that her blue-coated husband
compels her to live in an abode unfit
! for human habitation.- She says that
I way out on Point Lobos avenue, where
! the sand flies and the wind blows, he
j has built for her a house that is re
i markable for its lack of architectural
! beauty and general poverty-stricken
! appearance. It is made, she says, of
boards taken from old piano boxes.
Airs. Butler also finds considerable
fault with the â¢ manner in which she
alleges her husband treated her from
! the time she became his wife up to a
j few months ago, when, she says, she
j could no longer stand It and returned
! to the home of her parents. She say3
that notwithstanding he knew that she
was a good and true wife he constantly
I accused her of being a faithless spouse
I and hurt her feelings by Innuendo and
; base insinuations against her charac
j ter. She says that he also compelled
j her to work like a slave, compelling
: her when she was ill and suffering to
! rise at 5:30 a. m. and get his breakfast.
! She also says that when ahe was under
i a doctor's orders to refrain from all
| manual labor Butler compelled her to
j chop wood, carry coal, feed chickens,
i clean chicken-houses and do other
! things that caused her not only mental
! but physical suffering.
i Rose Dreyer wants a divorce from
William Dreyer -on the ground of
cruelty. She says that he once toro.
i her clothes after a slight disagreement
land on another occasion he threatened
i to carve her with a razor. She says
j also that she suffers mentally becaua?
j she is constantly dunned by collectors
| because of Dreyer's failure to pay hia
I bills. And, she continues, she suffers
j further mental torture because of the
j fact that her husband frequently ap
j pears at his home in a state of intox
; ication and with eyes blackened as the
I result of drunken rows. Â« ?
Suits for divorce were also filed by
Elizabeth Keogan against Lawrence J.
Keogan for desertion and Alice O. Buck
against John S. Buck for neglect.
Judge Hebbard granted Rosale Rich
stein a divorce from John J. Richstein
for neglect.
A call was sent out yesterday for
the annual convention of the Califor
nia Water and Forest Association,
which will be held in this city on April
22. The business to come before the
convention will be of great interest
The California Legislature, co-op
erating with the United States Gov
ernment, raised money for the pur
pose of doing preliminary work in this
State to determine many important
physical questions. The work that
was planned has been proceeding
along three lines. When the conven
tion comes together the Government
officials in charge will have reports
ready to submit, in which all that has
been done will 'be recounted and an
extensive review of the situation and
possibilities of accomplishment in the
directions favored by the association
will be made.
A forestry, geological and irrigation
investigation is simultaneously being
carried on in charge of Messrs. Gifford
Pinchot, Newell, Walcott and Elwood
Meade. The scope of their inquiries,
when they are all brought together in
reports, will' be seen to be very com
prehensive. Already in response to
suggestions from the forestry inves
tigating officials the Government has
withdrawn from the forest reserves
large areas of timbered land.
One purpose is to find out just what
is actually necessary to the proper
protection of the watersheds of the
rivers and other streams of California.
Another concerns the methods and
possibilities of irrigation. The geo
'loglcal inquiry has to do to a certain
extent with the ascertainment of the
mineral or non-mineral character of
lands now included in the national
forestry reserves in this State. This
interests the miners.
The California Water and Forest
Association has a membership of 5000
in round numbers. It includes prom
inent people in every county in Cal
ifornia. Through its influence an ap
propriation was obtained from the
California Legislature that made pos
sible the preliminary work that has
been in active progress during the last
year. When the reoorts are received
the necessity of further appropriations
to pursue the work, in view of what
remains to be done, will be discussed.
It is probable that an appropriation
will be sought from the next session of
the Legislature.
Riflemen May Not Compete.
NEW YORK, March 16.â Charging
that the American rifle team won the
Palma trophy last year with a special
weapon instead of with the United
States army service gun, the Dominion
Rifle Association will follow Great Brit
ain's example and not compete for the
trophy this year.
OTTAWA, Ontario, March 16.â It was
stated by officers of the Dominion Rifle
Association to-day that the question
of. entering the contest for the Palma
trophy this year will not be settled
until the annual meeting, which will
be held in about two weeks. It is
known that some members of the asso
ciation are averse to sending a Domin
ion team to Seagirt, but their ability
to control the meeting is doubted.
Special Dispatch to The Call
LOS ANGELES, March 16.â Mrs. Sa
die alias Peterson, who mys
teriously disappeared from her rooms
last Thursday and for whom the police
had been searching, fearing that her
once insane husband would murder her,
returned to her mother's home this
morning. She tells a weird tale, which
the police do not believe. She says that
soon after she left her home last
Thursday morning she was suddenly
seized from" behind, blindfolded, gagged
and thrown into a carriage. After a
long ride she was taken out of the
vehicle and carried up into the third
story of a building. When the bandage
Avas removed from, her eyes she saw
that she was in a comfortable room,
but the windows were barred. She says
she d,oes not know in what part of the
city this house is situated. Morning and
evening, she says, food was taken to
her room by a man or a woman. This
morning about 7 o'clock the man who
carried her away came to her room
and told her that as there had been
considerable printed about her disap
pearance in the papers he had deter
mined to release her. Again she was
blindfolded and taken downstairs and
placed in a carriage. There was an
other long drive and then the carriage
stopped and she was put out on the
street. This was at Eleventh and Geor
gia streets.
She declares that she did not see her
husband, and that so far as she knows
he liad nothing to do with her capture, j
Her manner is not that of a woman who
had passed through a very harrowing
experience, and she expressed a desire
that the matter be dropped rather than
have any further investigation made, t
It is considered hardly possible that she ;
could have been seized on a well trav- j
eled street in broad daylight and car
ried off without some persons witness
ing the abduction. She says she does !
not know either the man or woman
who held her captive.

The Gem Nail Clipper
KEEPS THE NAILS IN SPLENDID TRIM.
| . The "Care of the Nails'* is a subject in which every one should be interested, for it is rightly
j taken as an open index of good breeding and character. Laxity in the care of the nails Indicates
| | slovenliness. Perfect grooming of the nails is ofte:i an important element in a favorable decision
| when applying for a business position.
I A simple manicuring should be given the nails at least once a week. The cuticle should be
pushed back with a flat pointed (oar-shaped) orange stick. Soak the nails in a bowl of warm,
soapy water for five minutes. Then cut the nails the proper shape, being careful to remove all hang-
nails. File carefully and rub in some cold cream or vaseline; this will prevent brittleness. Re-
move it with a cloth and apply some manicure powder; rub briskly with a chamois polisher,
too high a polish is considered bad form.
The almond shaping is preferred; oval at the delicate finger-tips and short at the sides.
This cutting and shaping of the nails can be perfectly done with The Gem Nail Clipper, a complete
manicure set. For sale everywhere at 25c.
% âINSTRUCTIONS HOW TO USE- â â
8 TF1VF NATT fTTPPFR I
To use the Clipper press down firmly on the lever and release the lock by turning the
star. In using the Clipper always keep the lower jaw against the end of the finger, and, by sim-
ply changing the angle of presentation, cut the nail short or trim as desired.

bhlpped ten men aB seamen a few days ago

where it will be -used as fuel for oper
ating the machinery at the canneries.
The ship Eclipse cleared for Blaine.
The . schooners Premier and Prosper
cleared for Prince William Sound.
A large squadron of the vessels com
prising the Ealmon fleet cleared yester
day for northern ports.' Most of them
will sail to-day, and within a week the
whole fleet will be afloat and steaming
or tacking its way to the homes of the

The first witness for the defense was
J. M. Foy, secretary of the State
board, who read the minutes of the
meetings at which it was resolved to
oust Foster & Orear and install
brother-in-law Rooney. Rooney him
self told of his futile efforts to buy out
the plaintiffs, who valued their stock
at $8000,' their fixtures at $4000, and de
manded $17,000 besides for the good
will of the business they had built up.
Failing to bargain on these terms,
Orear had offered him a third interest
in the business on condition that he
The testimony of the next witnesses,
George H. Mastick and ex-Judge "W.
C. Van Fleet, the plaintiffs' attorneys,
dovetailed in exactly with the last evi
dence quoted. Van Fleet testified that
Spear told him in the fall that it was
not a question of rent and that the
board was not going to auction off the
franchise. "He said he wanted his
brother-in-law to have the lease be
cause ht* was out of business," Van
Fleet averred. "The next time I saw
him was at the meeting of the board,
when I presented our clients* bid of
$1180, after Rooney's bid of $600 had
been submitted by Commissioner
Spear. The members held a quiet talk
among the'mselves and then postponed
the master."
It was at the* next meeting. Decem
ber 30. that- the Rooney bid was raised
to $1200 and quickly accepted, although
it is admitted that the plaintiffs' law
yers had given notice that their clients
were prepared to raise any bid Rooney
might make.
Attorney Mastick told the court that
at the subsequent meeting of January
12 Spear said to him that the Rooney
lease was all settled and would not be
reopened. Mackenzie had said to him
at the same meeting that no other
bids would be received or considered.
ROOXEY GIVEN" TIME.
Milton H. Esberg of the tobacco firm
of M. A. Gunst & Co. said he had
called on Spear in the interest of Fos
ter & Orear, who were customers of
his house. The Commissioner told him
that he had had some altercation with
Orear and did not consider him a
fit man to hold the place. Esberg had
remarked that it ought to go to the
highest bidder, but he had been given to
understand that the rent was not a
vital point.
Horace Orear and Charles â¢ Foster,
the plaintiffs, both testified of their
conversation with Spear and the other
Commissioners in the effort to hold
their privilege at the ferry. Spear had
told them that it was a political, not
a business proposition; that the rent
they were then paying ($420 a month)
was enough; that the Commissioners
did not intend to rut the privilege up
for bids, and that the occupants had
better sell out to Rooney. Mackenzie
had told Orear, on December 30, the
day of the meeting at which the priv
ilege was voted to Rooney. that it was
not necessary for Orear to be at the
meeting, as he could bid later If he
wished. This privilege was later re
fused him.
REXT CUT NO FIGURE.
"I am not sure that the question of
rental was mentioned at ail," he an
swered.
Spear -was the first witness for the
plaintiffs, and in answer to questions
by W. B. Treadwell of Mastlck, Van
Fleet & Mastick, their attorneys, he
told how he had given notice to Foster
& Orear last July that he wanted
the news stand privilege "for a friend
of mine. Orear replied that he would
fight. Thereupon I said: 'Well, Mr.
Orear, if you are going to talk that
way you need not talk to me any fur
ther.' " This conversation had been
followed by others with one or both
members of the firm. In the second
interview Spear had told Orear that
it was his brother-in-law, Rooney, for
whom he wanted the place.
Spear admitted that ex-Judse Van
Fleet, the plaintiffs* attorney, had pre
sented his clients' bid of $1500 a month
for the privilege which was let to
Rooney at $1200.
Commissioner John D. Mackenzie
could not recall the date when Spear
first approached him in the interest of
Rooney, but said it was long before
the board acted. "I told him I would
stand by Rooney," he admitted.
"Was this because the tenants were
not paying enough rent?" was asked
the Commissioner.
SPEAR'S ADMISSIONS.
A lively fight for the possession of
the ferry news stand privilege was
pulled off yesterday in the Superior
Court, with Judge Seawell as referee.
It was the hearing on the motion to
make permanent the Judge's tempor
ary injunction restraining the Harbor
Commissioners from ousting Foster &
Orear, Â« the present tenants of the
stands, from the privilege they have
held for more than a decade, and let
ting it to John F. Rooney, brother-in
law of Commissioner Charles Spear.
Much evidence was introduced to show
that the lease to Rooney was granted
for personal or political reasons, with
out calling for bids and In spite of
the known fact that Foster & Orear
were prepared to raise their competi
tor's bid.
Much of this evidence was forced
from Commissioners Spear and Mac
kenzie, who were called as witnesses
for the plaintiffs. Mackenzie admitted
that long before the matter came up
in the board meetings he had promised
Spear to vote for Rooney, and all the
efforts of counsel for the board on
cross-examination failed to get him to
say that when this promise was given
the question of rental was even men
tioned. "When the defendant's turn
came Spear was recalled as a witness
for the board, but his testimony was
chiefly remarkable for its failure to
controvert the most material allega
tions of the plaintiffs' other witnesses.
After argument of counsel the case was
submitted. ,

NEW YORK, March 16.â The stock market
continued under the domination of the Northern
Securities case to-day and the movement of
prices was accepted as showing a considerable
short interest still remaining uncovered, as a
consequence of short sales made in anticipation
of the decision. Professional operations were
directed against the short interest and designed
to lift prices go as to make a profit out of the
DeccMlt/ of the unoowiwi contracts. There
were Â«;'>me commission houses which reached an
appreciable Increase in the outside demand for
etocks, but this was small and there was a
general agreement that the principal buying
was due to the closing up of bear storks. Part
ly as a cause, partly as an effect of the upward
tendency of prices, more cheerful views pre
vailed about the Stock Exchange. Much less
apprehension wag professed regarding the ulte
rior consequences to be looked for from the
conditions established by the Northern Securi
ties decision. There was not so much fear that
the railroad and Industrial organization gener
ally, which is the basis of the securities mak
ing up the Ftock market, was put in Jeopardy
under the ruling of the Supreme Court. This
sentiment was based partly on the belief that
it w<juld not be the policy of the administration
to push its power under the ruling tÂ« an ex
treme, and evÂ»-n more so to a revised view of
the significance of the opinions of the Justices
themselves, based on the exceptions made by
Justice Brewer to the majority opinion. Wall
street to-day had read into this opinion the
probability that the majority of the Supreme
Court would not uphold the extreme scoi>e of
the ruling in the Northern Securities case In
another case where the reasonablen^Fe and ben
efit of a combination might be urged, even
though it should b<? in restraint of Interstate or
international commerce. Another decidedly fa
voring influence was the restored confidence
manitested in foreign stock markets. If there
I Is good ground for the confidence reported from
i Paris that the danger of entanglement of other
| lowers growing out of the present war has
been definitely averted our stock market would
be relieved of a threatening factor, equal in
imi>OTtjLnce to the Northern Securities case
itsi-lf. As the demand from the shorts became
satisfied the tendency of prices to drop became
more pronounced. I'nited States Steel pre
ferred iailed rather signally until just at the
last to reflect the improved condition in the
trade indicated by the advance in the prices for
eeveral lines of finished products.
The reactionary tendency of securities con
nected with the Northern Securities Company
was of sympathetic effect on the general mar
ket. The day's gains were largely wiped out
by the final hour and the closing was irregu
lar.
Bonds were irregnlar. Total sale?, $2,470,

Henry Clews says in his New York circular:
â¢â¢The stock market teems to ' have fallen
Into a etate of coma. Now that liquidation is
complete a period of exhaustion ha* apparent
ly set in, the most natural remedy for which
Â¦will I* the rest cure. Commission houses are
yracticaliy bare of stocks- traders fear to take
the ehort side of the market and find no par
ticular inducements on the long side, while
the big leaders w ho uÂ« carrying the ' stocks

ditions before undertaking any ntw activities,
l.'r.der such circumstances dullness is inevita

"A favorable feature in the financial situa

4>nd rood bonds eometim.es selling on a 5 per

chief, trouble with the market now i* lack of
buying j>oÂ»er, due to exhaustion. Other hln
irsncee are the Presidential campaign, the
cutties of rates by the Eastern trunk lines
and the proei>eets of further issues by the lat
ter for contemplated improvements. A drop \>f
n;ore than $ll,5on.<xK> in February exports (or
J12.a00.O00 In cotton and breadstuffs alone)
va also a significant feature. The general
trueiatÂ«* situation, however. Is sound, and time
should bring about a natural recovery. Im
provement in the iron trade is a satisfactory
feature, and the declines in railroad earning*
eeem chiefly due to the severe winter. It
Â°must be admitted that some reaction has been
experienced in business, but as spring ap
proaches and tranÂ«x>rta.ticn facilities improve
there ehould b* a revival of activities. Mean
while, vaiues may eaÂ« temporarily, but tha
movement in the long run is more likely to be

Â¦ however, the total for the week Just ended
! amounting to 2500 tons, in comparison with
; 2800 ions for the week preceding. Nothing
j new haÂ« developed in the line of outside de
\ mand or foreign shipment, so the market at the
i present writing- Is decidedly dull. Inquiries con
Â¦ tlnue to come in from the Orient and several
I agents for the. Japanese Government have been
I carefully investigating the Hay situation here.
! so that it would seem that something would
result from It all in the not very distant
future Most of the dealers are complaining
of the slack local trade, but this should nat
urally improve as soon as the weather clears.
"Crop prospects continue most encouraging,
and from pretent indications we will have one
of the heaviest yields of Hay throughout the
State for several years.
"Choice wheat Hay has not been In as quite
plentiful supply of late, the majority of the
anivals being very good Brade. Good tame
oat is offered quite freely also, although it was
1 predicted some little time ago that this grade
j of Hay would disappear from the market quite
early. To summarize we would state that, al
though quotations have not materially declined.
, yet we find that occasionally concessions have
- to be made to effect sales."

Beans and Seeds.
The current situation in Beans is about as
follows: The Russian Government Is buying
heavily in Europe, which has checked Importa
j tions of German Beans at New York, where
supplies are greatly reduced. The Michigan
market Is also largely depleted and has lately
advanced 15c per bushel. These conditions
ought to strengthen this market, but they are
offset by the recent rains, which greatly im
prove the crcp prospects, hence the net result
is a stRnd-off. Prices show no further change.

The best offerings of table Potatoes were
steady unuer a good demand and comparatively
light supplies, but low-grade offering, which
constituted the bulk of supplies, were weak at
unsteady rates. Seed .kinds continued to meet
j with a steady demand. Sweets were ! well
I cleaned up, and as there are no more expected
I bsfors Monday choice lots were llrmly held

; further - declines In yellow Onions, but the

Butter, Cheese and Eggs.
There was more Butter on the market yes
terday and trade was quieter, as the urgency
of the demand hail been satisfied on Monday.
Prices remained unchanged. .
The trade continue to quote a dull and over
stocked Cheese market at previous prices.
The only change in Eggs was a decline of
%c In store descriptions. Reports as to prices
being paid In the country by speculators are
conflicting, but ai far as can be learned they
are paying more than the same Eggs will bring
net on the San Francisco market. This condi
tion confuses the situation here and puts the
market In unsatisfactory, shape. The country
producer wants at least as much for his Eggs
in San Francisco as the speculators are paying
In the country, and If he does not get it there
is dissatisfaction. But the speculator wants
the Eggs and will get them even if he has to
pay over the San Francisco quotations for
them.

Deciduous and Citrus Fruits.
RecelptB of Oranges were heavy, aggregating
13 cars, but despite the heavy receipts and the
threatening weather the market held up well,
as the prevailing low prices seemed to stimu
late the demand, particularly among peddlers
and ' small retailers. , who were purchasing
freely, thus preventing any further accumula
tion of supplies. There was some Inquiry for
fancy lots for shipment to near-by towns and
to Puget Sound ports, and the greater part of
a car of extra fancy Redlands fruit that was
offered at' auction was bought for shipment
to Sacramento. Business In the auction rooms
was- fair, although there was not -much cfcm

SUMMARY OF THE MARKETS.
greatly needed. Owlnsr to the bearish factors
there was a teneral selling movement at the
opening. Hay being ViSl&e lower,,at 07Â®O7'4c
July was down %9%c, at 92%@92%c. Offer
lnise fouJid few purchasers, and as the session
advanced prices steadily v declined. The ex
treme weakness In Southwestern markets
seemed to confirm opinions that the end of
the drouth in the winter- wheat belt was In
eight. A big decline at Kansas City brought
out increased sales from pit traders and caused
further recession In prices. The principal
trading 1 was in the July delivery, which also
showed the greatest loss. Occasionally the
market would rally slightly In response to
buyinsr by commission houses, but the flrm
n<sa-waf> fhort-llved. The low point of the
day was reached just prior to the close, when
May touched 9Â«5W.e and July 90%c. Final fig
ures on May were 0G%c. July closed at 00%C.
A sharp break occurred In corn as a result of
the decline in wheat, the weakness in the lat
ter market stimulatine- an aggressive selling
movement. The closo found the market almost
at the low level. May opened >Â£@%c lower,
at 54{JMVic and closed at 53V6<g5.J 1 ,ic July
closed at nO^fcuO^câ lÂ»Â£Â«il%c lower.
' Oats followed the load of other grains. May
closed nenr the bottom, at 40%c, and July at
3S%Â®3S%c.
The weakness that developed In provisions
was due to the early selling by commission
houses. The break in grain prices and a heavy
run of hers, with lower prices at the yards,
were the inuln factors. May pork cloÂ«d 17Hi
Â©20c lower: May lard 10@12^c lower, and
May ribs 12^c lower.

Professor Robert Furlong, chief of

exposition and some of the work oi
the California school children has been
started on its journey.
The headquarters in this city of the
California Commissioners to the St.
Louis Exposition will be closed to-mor
row night. Commissioner Wiggins and
Secretary Willis are in St. Louis. Com
missioner Filcher has wound up about
all the business that remained to be
done in San Francisco or other Cali
fornia points, with the exception of the
shipping of exhibits that are not ready
to start on the overland journey.
Eight carloads of exhibits, including
the mineral arch that is to decorate thÂ«
California exhibition in the mines and
mining building, have gone East. There
are nearly twenty more carloads to gc
forward and the probability is that ths
last of the exhibits will not be in St.-
Louis before the end of April. N
The delay in the matter of reaching
an understanding about the exhibition
space for the University of California
made the collection of exhibits repre
senting the university late. None of
them have yet gone on to St. Louis.
The bulk of the forestry exhibit for
the forestry building ana the greater
part of the mineral exhibit of Cali
fornia is still in this State. Until the
arrangements for installing what is to
be shown are finally completed therÂ».
is no particular haste about getting the

Ehow into St. Louis. They are in such
shape that .they can be forwarded ia
a few days after urgency Instructions
are received from the California Com
missioners.
A heavy, three-seated automobile
With a steam driving power, belonging
to^ the Mobile Company and driven by
Frank Smith, a chauffeur, caught fire
yesterday afternoon about 5 o'clock on
Golden Gate avenue, between Gough
and Octavia, and was entirely de-
Etroyed except the engine."
t-mith was returning from the park
Â¦with two male passengers and after
passing Octavia street one of the pas
sengers cried out, "She's afire!" Smith
glanced back and saw the rear of the
vehicle in flames. He stopped the ma
chine and the occupants piled out. In
a moment the automobile was wrapped
in a blaze that, mounted fifty feet into
the air. A crowd assembled and some
body turned in a fire alarm.
Al Faulkner and Harry Chambers,
two well known chauffeurs employed by
the Mobile Company, were at the barn
at Van Xess and Golden Gate avenues
and saw the burst of flame. Hastily
loading two flre extinguishers into a
high speed French machine, they
made a record run up Golden Gate ave
nue, arriving in time to save the en
gine. All of the woodwork of the ma
chine was destroyed, together with
rnbes, seat cusl-lons, etc., and the
framework was so badly damaged as
to render it practically useless. The
company estimates the loss at $1500.
The cause of the fire is attributed to
a leakage in the gasoline tank which
supplies the fueL None of the occu
pants was injured, but one of the pas
sengers had the back of his overcoat
burned out.

Assistant Chief Dougherty explained
in detail the plans, which provide that
the theaters should be protected
against fire with both automatic
sprinkfers and perforated pipe systems,
so that in the event of a fire occurring
when there is no performance or the
fireman is not at his post to operate
the perforated pipe ! system the auto
matic sprinkler will perform its func

It is designed to have two tanks of
large capacity located on the roof of
the theater to supply both systems, in
addition to the city water supply, so
that in the "event, repairs are being
made to the rriains there will be suf
ficient water in the tanks for an .hour.
The /perforated pipe system provides
for piping located in the gridiron and

-We have found," saiC Chief Train
Agent Lund yesterday, "dozens of
places along the company's lines in thia
State where men have been making a
regular business of mulcting the.com
pany of thousands of dollars tiy the
manipulation of tickets on which the
original holders had secured stopover
privileges. Pawnshops at Sacramento,
Stockton, Fresno and Bakersfield, a
cigar stand at Sacramento, a drugstore
at Bakersfield, a saloon at Fresno and |
several cigar stores and hotel clerks in
Los Angeles and San Jose were dis
covered to be handling these tickets.
The company devoted several months
to getting evidence and was positive of
its position before It decided on what
action, to take."
It was learned yesterday that all
these cases are now In the hands of the
attorneys of the company and that
many arrests are to follow the prosecu
tion of Johnson.
A few days ago the company placed
a number of these tickets on sale aa
an experiment, and it is claimed that
Johnson of Watsonville, finding that
one of the tickets had been improperly
punched, wrote in the station number
of San Jose and disposed of the ticket
to the son of Justice of the Peace Haw
kins. The ticket was taken away from
the boy on the train and the youngster
then made\ a confession Implicating
Johnson, whose arrest followed yester
day.
Five months ago Chief Train Agent
Lund got an inkling of the fraudulent
manner in which the company's tickets
were being handled and a thorough in
vestigation all along the line from Port
land to El Paso resulted In the dis
covery that the fraud was in common
practice and thousands of dollars were
being lost by the company as aÂ» result.
Seme weeks ago the passenger depart
ment prepared . a new form of card
ticket with a view toward stopping the
scalping. The ticket consists of two
parts, a passage coupon and an Iden
tification check, the former having a
colored face and the latter being in
white. The check portion of the ticket
is properly lined, so that the conductor
may write in the name of any station
at which a traveler desires a stopover
and opposite his writing the conductor,
after carefully folding the two coupons
together, leaves the Impression of hla
punch opposite the name of the station
inscribed by* him on the stopover check.
By this method any effort to success
fully manipulate the ticket for further
transportation over the portion of the
route that has already been traversed
is prevented.
YOUNG HAWKINS CONFESSED-
INVESTIGATION* FOIXOWS.
gauge route was a competitor of the
Southern Pacific in the same territory,
and when Senator Fair sold his nold
ings to. the Southern Pacific the rate
was not changed. From San Francisco
or Oakland to Watsonville or Pajaro,
notwithstanding that the distance is
shorter, the rate is also $2 SO. Conse
quently many persons, encouraged by
tho men engaged in the traffic of rail
road tickets, when desiring to so from
this city >to Watsonville, buy a ticket
to Santa wruz for the same price and
ask the conductor to give them a stop*
over at Pajaro or Watsonville. The
latter being a changing p^int for con
ductors, the backs of the tickets are not
marked and readily find their way into
the hands of the brokers there, who. It
is claimed, have boldly marked on the
backs of the tickets the name of some
station nearer this end of the line and
forged the name of the conductor under
the date. Then the ticket Is 3ent back
tc the point designated by the fraudu
lent memorandum and resold for Santa
Cruz or some point near there, at a
cut rate.
CONDUCTOR'S NAME FORGED.
At certain stations, however, where
the conductors change, this formality
was eliminated and it has been mainly
at thesa particular changing places
that the fraudulent work has been ac
complished. For Instance, the company
has long maintained between San
Francisco or Oakland and Santa Cruz
a rate of $2 80. It is a rate that was es
tablished years "ago, wnen the narrow
The method of the alleged fraud is
a simple, one, and has been going on
for many years. Under a construction
of the State law, a railroad ticket is
transferrable and this fact, together
with the stopover privilege, which each
piece of pasteboard carries, has been
taken advantage of by a number of
persons in reissuing the tickets at a
cut rate, for the transportation' a sec
ond time over the same route for which
they were originally purchased. For
many years it has been the practice of
the company's conductors on its local
routes, when a passenger desired to
stop over at some station between his
point of departure and destination, to
punch the ticket and then mark on the
back of it the designating number of
the town at which the traveler was to
stop, and underneath this number the
conductor would sign his name.
Tha Southern Pacific Company took
the Initial step yesterday In a plan for
the prosecution on criminal charges of
many men along its Western system
accused of ha\'ing fraudulently manip
ulated local tickets, by which practice
the company has been mulcted 'jut of
many hundreds of thousands of
dollars. In the afternoon a war
rant was Issued at Watsonvllle
for the arrest of F. TV. John
son, proprietor of a hotel oi that
town. Mho is charged with forgery, it
being <lii<med by the company thit the
accused recently fraudulently altered a
railroad ticket which he disposed of Jo
the son of Samuel Hawkins, Justice of
the Peace of AVatsonvillo,
According to the statement maae yes
torday by Chief Train Agent Lund of
the Southern Pacific Company, John
son's case is but one of many that have
been thoroughly Investigated by the
company, and his arrest will be fol
lowed by the prosecution criminally of
numerous others. Including pawnbrok
ers, saloon-keepers, proprietors of cigar
stands, hotel clerks and druggists in
various towns along the railroad line
from Portland in the north to El Paso
in the south. ;
Curiously enough only one peremp
tory challenge was required to dispose
of the thirty talesmen, 'and that was
exercised by the prosecution. The other
twenty-nine were either unwilling to
inflict the death penalty upon a woman,
had, conscientious 6cruples against cir
cumstantial evidence or had formed an
opinion as to the merits of the charge
that evidence could. not alter. Most of
those summoned were business men,
and they displayed much unwillingness
to serve on the jury.
Attachments were Issued for thirteen
of the talesmen who failed to answer
their names". Among these was a man
who has been dead several months,
and when Judge Cook learried this fact
he mercifully withdrew the attachment.
It has come to light that District At
torney Byington was much relieved
when he was assured that John P.
Dunning, husband of the murdered
woman, and his little_ daughter were
on their way East with the other East
ern witnesses for the prosecution. At
first Dunning flatly refused to attend
the second trial of the woman with
whom he had been Intimate and whose
love for himself is the alleged motive
for the murfler of Mrs. Dunning. Strong
pressure was brought to bear upon
him, not because h* is regarded as an
indispensable witness, but for the moral
effect which his presence will have on
the jury.
Finally he consented to come if his
expenses were advanced and he was i
compensated for his loss of time. \
Deputy District Attorney Tom Ken- j
nedy,' who was sent East to secure the !
witnesses, eventually prevailed o^i
Dunning to make the westward journey
on condition that all his expenses
would be paid.
Thirty talesmen out of the special
venire summoned Tuesday as possible
material for Jurors in the case of the
People of California vs. -Cordelia
Botkin, charged with the murder of
Mrs. Elizabe'th Dunning, were ex
amined yesterday, and none of them
was found fit for the duty demanded.
The remainder of the venire were ex
cused by Judge Cook or else failed to
answer their names, bo that not a sin
gle additional juror was secured. Ac
cordingly another venire of seventy
five names was issued, returnable this
morning at 10 o'clock, from which it is
hoped the three still wanted may be
selected
Mr. Fisk declined to state yesterday
the name of O'Connor's successor, but
rumor points to Hull McClaughry,
"Lucky" Baldwin's son-in-law, as the
lucky man. Mr. McClaughry at pres
ent occupies the position of secretary to
the Postmaster.
The salary of Cashier "Walter L.
Stowell of the stamp department has
been cut from $2000 to $1700 per annum.
It had been $1700 originally, but through
the influence of Daniel S. Richardson,
who was a close friend of Stowell, the
salary was increased to $2000.
It is reported that at an early date
there will be a general removal of the
non-civil service appointees of former
administrations and that their places
will be filled by friends of the Fisk ad
ministration. Mr. Fisk said yesterday
that he had not made up his mind as to
future changes and would not do so un
til he had had an opportunity of famil
iarizing himself with the situation. It
is believed, however, that all salaries
above normal will be cut down td the
normal level.
Postmaster Fisk was very much cha
grined yesterday when he learned that
the fact that Acting Cashier E. A.
O'Connor of the postofllce was to be re
moved on April 1 had been made pub
lic. For some reason which has never
been published impending changes in
the San Francisco postofflce are never
made known to the public. After the
changes have been made the fact is
made known.
Mr. O'Connor has been acting as
cashier for many years, and proved
himself to be an honest and competent
official. But Daniel S. Richardson, who
was acting as superintendent of the
postofflce, appeared on the payroll as
cashier and drew the salary of the po
sition, while Mr. O'Connor performed
all of its duties.
