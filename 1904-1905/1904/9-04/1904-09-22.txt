MANILA. Sept. 21. â The Augustin
ian friars have repudiated the agree
ment made in Rome between the late
Pope Leo, the late Archbishop Guldi,
apostolic delegate in the Philippine
Islands, and former Governor Taft
that the money paid by the United
States in the purchase of the friars
lands should remain in the islands and
have requested that the payments to
them be made in drafts on London.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 21. â It is said
at the War Department that the de
partment is not a party to any con T
troversy respecting the method of pay
ing for the frairs* lands in the Philip
pines, and the issue presented as to
the place of payment, whether In Ma
nila or in Europe, lies between the
authorities of the Vatican and the
friars' orders, the latter being the
titular owners of the land. Of course,
the officials would like to see the
money remain in the Islands, but It is
prepared to accept a decision either
â¢way on that point

He quoted the astonishing fact that
to-day the value of the. agricultural
and manufactured products of Cali
fornia is more than fifteen times the
value of the mineral products of the
State. There : were ' great ' figures to be

Perkins. Congressman J. C. Needham
and Fairfax H. Wheelan.
The feature of the banquet was the
address of â¢ Secretary Victor H. Met
calf. In his capacity as Secretary of
the Department of Commerce and
Labor his duty lies largely on the lines
In which California and the entire Pa
cific Coast are principally interested.
In a comprehensive massing of sig
nificant figures and facts he mani
fested great familiarity- with the ma
terial conditions in this State. He
called attention at the outset to the
fact that the development of California
has been remarkable.
"There Is no State in the Union," he
said, "with a population approximately
equal that approaches us in the value
of the products of farm and factory."
He reviewed the progress of mining
and showed that California has pro
duced more than one-half of the total
gold output of the United States to
date. .. . :'

The raisin- industry, the grain pro

brought into evidence in the picture
of California's greatness.

enthusiasm and indorsed with cordial
speeches of support by representatives
of three of the elements whose attitude
had been an important factor In the
serious situation which had formed the
subject of the conference. Incidentally
Hill was accorded a reception which
was little less than an ovation.

ECENE AT THE BANQUET GIVEN
IN HONOR OF SECRETARY VIC- '
TOR H. METCALF. .
I thank you for this welcome,
this more than cordial reception,
and especially do I thank you for
the opportunity thus afforded me
of saying something to you con
cerning the, resources of our
State, its growth and develop
ment and the bright prospects
that are in store for it in the fu
ture. The development of Cali
fornia in the past has been most
remarkable, perhaps more . so
than the development of any
other State in the Union. Our
commonwealth, which was the
thTty- first of the forty -five
States in the order of admis
sion to the Union, now stands
twenty- first in population, four
teenth in value of agricultural
products and twelfth in value of
manufactures, and there is no
State in the Union with a popu
lation approximately equal that
approaches us in the value of
the products of farm and factory
combined.
METCALF GIVES PRAISE.
. The action of the President In selecting him
was wise, and every section ot the country may
well be proud of the ability, integrity and
splendid equipment â¢ of our new . Secretary',
but nowhere . should there . be â¢ more rejoicing
than here . In this far" city on the Western
coast, whose sun-kissed -hills at set of Â«un
but reflect the future . glory, of a commerce that
may from Its center, encompass the world.
I It. is good -.to *have a good man in. such an
office, but It is a great advantage Indeed to
a city situated like -ours to -have not only a
good, official, but one' Intimately, acquainted
with. . our Â¦ needs, . cognizant . of our- past and
Imbued with an exulting hope and a fixed con
fidence in our. future â a man the lines of whose
J For,the city of San Francisco Mayor
Schmitz spoke. . He was frequently in
terrupted-by applause. Some extracts
from ; his Â¦ remarks follow :
Â¦ -In this" deserved testimonial . to a distin
guished and honored Callfornian I participate
with; the greatest pleasure, as the official head
of a city which above' all others In our broad
land : looks for encouragement and legitimate
advantage to the department\of government
now under his control.
It has often i been said that one potential
reason why California, has .not secured la times
past- more ' recognition In similar -capacities
was because, of the .fact*, that whenever any
individual, no matter what- hts worthor abil
ity,'was proponed for any. position, a chorus of
captious Â¦ objections or protests on the part,
maybe of personal enemies or -of those who
aspired . to the position themselves,' .would be
raised, and the .result- was that the selection
that, might have been secured here would go
to a' more harmonious â¢ community. â¢
' This lack of unanimity and of concord has
no doubt, in 'the past injured us, and so it is
with mingled feelings of pleasure and of satis
faction that we note the selection of Mr. Met
calf .to the ' position '.he now occupies without
one single .protest ;or. objection being raised on
the 'part . of - any. person, or organization in the
State of California. It is a healthy as well
as a' gratifying' sign of the times, and now
that he is there. Jknow that.. with his ability,
his , energy and his . loyalty, he will | rise equal
to - any , emergency at any time and will so
conduct' himself and perform the duties of hlÂ»
office that they will be a credit to the nation
and- that. hÂ«. will Justify the honor and pride
that the. people of the State of California feel
in, him and in his. appointment to his exalted
position.. â¢ Â¦' â¢ . -
STRENGTH INiHARMONY.
"While we appreciate and are thankful for the
recognition now' thus given. I would have It.
as. "I said before, established an unwritten law
that the Pacific Coast have representation In
the President's Cabinet, and. no matter what
political party was In power or who the Presi
dent, or what his name, that California should
at. least have one- representative therein. I do
not mean, by this that Just as patriotic and
Just as able men- could not be selected from
elsewhere as frcp here, but I do mean to say
that. many, questions have arisen in the past
and will constantly arise In the future which
are peculiarly; and particularly our own, and
no. man who haÂ» not .resided here' can have
thÂ« -.immediate, - the Intuitive and you might
say instinctive knowledge of matters .like cnÂ«
who has resided here and, has- been 'in con
stant ' dally j touch with' us .and' thÂ« conditions
as they.exift.. * >$,.v ., .;
Circumstances "not" determined -here or by
us have assisted- at" this time â¢ In . making- us
more significant and important, because of
location, to the nation at large. -The building
of/the Panama canal, the acquisition of and
developments in the Sandwich Islands, the
awakening In the. Orient;, our affairs and in
terests, in the Philippinesâ all these have to do
vitally *ith. the xinterests and welfare of this
nation as a whole,' and. being upon the thresh
old of. the" vast area whÂ»reln lies these opera
tions and those Interests, we cannot help but
be more particularly and directly Interested
than' any 'other parts of the Tnion: and whilÂ«
California's most pronounced greatness is to
come from within, and will be based uptfn her
ability to sustain and provide for a larger
per capita population than perhaps any other
place In.' the world, she must take cognizance
of aftairs and conditions as they exist, and in
doing so.' must be alive to the advantages of
close political association and influence with
those who .have the directing of the policies
and the affairs of the nation.

Secretary of the Department of Com
merce and Labor, to be held at the
Macdonough Theater to-morrow even
ing, wiir.be distinctly a home and a
non-partisan affair. It -will be a token
of the esteem and regard that the peo
ple of Oakland have for the latest
member of the Cabinet. Mr. Metcalf
ia an Oaklarider who has grown up
with this community; he has made
himself a part of Oakland und has
done much for its advancement.
The committee that has had charge
of the arrangements for the reception
has extended an invitation to Mr. Met
calf, the ipvitation being engraved
upon a plate of gold weighing three
ounces. It reads:
OAKJLAXD RDCEFTIOX READY.
When the Merr-hants' Association got back
of the new charter it took a solemn oath that
it would ct&nd up for the civil service fea
ture cratained In It (prolonged cheers). The
other organizations, through the majority of
their members, belong to the Merchants' As
bo< iaticn. which is therefore jrretter than any
one of them. We outnumber all the rest. Our
lourdatioriF were laid' so well and strong
fay OiÂ« revÂ«rÂ»d F. W. Dohrmann that you all
look to the Merchants' Association to sÂ«e that

When the commerce of the Pacific Ocean

hit ornre, has directed that all these ships
thall pass in and out of the port of San Fraa

out to mt+l the ship* Is sent by the Mer

the veass! arrives in port all the traffic is
carried on by Mr. Watlcins of the Baa Fran

of Trade takes the matter up and extends
it bark into th* irtertor of the State and the

when he rose to speak for the com

behalf. He hm not able to proceed
immediately. When the tumult died
down he began somewhat humorously.
The substance of a part ot his speech
is as follows:

In this part of the exercises Toast
master Newhall proposed that thd
health of President Roosevelt, who
appointed Secretary Metcalf, . should
be drunk standing. The greetings were
concluded by three cheers for the, Sec
retary of the Department of Commerce
and Labor. The event was entirely
successful from beginning to end.
The following were present at the
banquet: .
At the close of the Secretary's
speech the audience again compli
mented him by rising and cheering.
Following these ceremonies there
were responses to toasts. United States
Senator George C. Perkins-- t-esponded
to "Congress" and took occasion to
pay tribute to the efficiency and ser
vices of Secretary Metcalf. Congress
man Needham spoke to the toast of
"Central California." He also highly,
complimented the services of Mr. Met
calf when he was a Representative on
the floor of Congress. The final re
sponse was made by Fairfax H. Whee-.
Ian to the toast "Commerce) and
Labor." ; v :Â¦:' . .. .. ; Â¦> ?.. '
I was much gratified when In St. Louis to
find t^at the men in charge of the exhibits
from the various counties in this State were
working harmoniously and doing all that lay
In th-Â»lr power to advance and promote the
business interest* and the Industries of the
entire State. There was no "knocking," no
attempt to build up cne county at the ex
pense of another, but an earnest desire to
have those visiting that wonderful fair see all
that could be seen of California's magnificent
and diversified products; and I would like to
Bee the same good feeling and the same good
fellowship existing between the business mn
of the Pacific States and Territories. Nevada,
Oregon and Washington are our neighbors.
They want many of our products and we want
many cf theirs. Jf there is any rivalry, let It
be of a irlendly character; let there be no
"knocking," but honest business competition
and rivalry; for, as California grows. and de
velops, eo will these States grow and develop,
for there is room and opportunity for us all.
We are far away from the centers of trade
and from the centers of population, but we
have in California a most magnificent citizen
ship, second to none in the United States.
We have great wealth, we have men of great
business capacity, of indomitable energy and
pt-rsevvrance and Inventive genius. We are
but in the dawn ot our prosperity, and it is
altncst impossible to predict what our future
will be. And now Just a few words more in
conclusion:
SPIiENDID CITIZENSHIP.
The building of the Pacific railroads In "65
put California, to a certain extent, in touch
with the rest of the United States, and our
commercial and industrial progress dates from
that event. The building of the Panama canal
will put California In . touch with all the
world and our second commercial growth will
date from the hour of its completion. Hither
to the Atlantic has been the commercial ocean,
and the Atlantic seaport cities of our country
have grown Into a commerce surpassing that
which. Venice was five centuries In achieving.
We may fairly expect that the time has come
when the port of Ban Francisco, Instead- of
being sixth or Mventh In rank In the. United
Ptate*, will have grown to the second; perhaps
even the first. In the volume and value j of
Its outgoing and incoming commerce. Â¦
What we need is markets for our products
and cheap rates In order to market those
ptoducts. Practically half of the population
of the world is on the Pacific Ocean. This
magnificent body of water covers nearly one
fourth of the earth's surface, and the Imag
ination of man can hardly conceive what the
future has in store for us. For, as haa been
wcl! B aid by the man who is, In my Judg
ment, the most eminent diplomat in the world,
John Hay, "the diplomacy of McKlnley and
Roosevelt has been directed principally to
our present and future interests in the Pa
cific, on whose wide shores so much of the
world' h work is to be done." The open-door
policy has come to China, the empire of Japan
â¢haÂ« developed into a world power, the Hawai
ian Islands have been annexed, giving us con
trol of the most Important coaling station in
the Pacifls. and the Philippine Islands, rich
beyond imagination In tholr natural resources
and trade ix)fct>il>llities, have dn>pj>ed into our
l>cs*-esyion as by a dispensation of providence.
And now another change Is pending, pregnant
with still greater possibilities for the future
development of our State.
For the Panama canal Is now an assured
fuct, and It will not be many years /before this
great project, the dream of the most eminent
statesmen of the world for a century or more,
will be an assured fact. What the cutting
or the Panama canal will ultimately mean
ta the Pacific Coast and the harbor of Ban
Francisco and Oakland we cannot measure
evÂ«n *n imadnatlon.
NEED OF MARKETS.
San Francisco imported in 1S70 goods to the
value of $15.US2.&4D, and in luftt goods to the
value cf $UU.40i,2x!. Pugfct Sound,- on the
other hand, in 1ST0 imported pwkIh to the
value of ?."H.7S7, and in l'.HKJ goods to the
value of $il2.U7,2Â«:t. San Francisco in 1870
exported goods to the value of $13,004,781; and
in 1003 goods to the value of $33,5O2,eiC. Puget
found in 1S70 exported iroods to the value of
$1^7,WÂ»i>, and in l'.RC her experts were of the
value of $32,-lÂ»0,82S. a remarkable Increaee.
and aw increase showing the wonderful de
velopment of that magnificent State and the
push and energy of its enterprising business
me-n. One reasjn for the falling off in San
Francisco's tx^orts and imports is ihe fact
that Hawaii was admitted as a territory of
the Union, and since lSDu the trade with the
Hawaiian Islands has not been included cither
in imports or exports, for Hawaii Is now a
collection district. One of the main reasons,
l>erhar>s. for ttc great increase in the exports
from Pugct Sound is the fact that large quan
tities of unmanufactured cotton are shipped
from that section.
.In 11HW over 4U.U47.4SO uounds were tshlpped
from Puset Bound, and from Kan Francisco
but 10,900,471 pounds. The experts from Puget
Sound, however, during lfKVi were nearly three
times the imports, while the exports frum San
Franclaco during the Mune period were nearly
three millions less than the imports. Califor
nia, so to speak, has not kept up with the
procession when It cornea to the question of
exports, for during the period ffcm 175)0 to
February 2S, 1S07, the excess of exports over"
imports in the United States, was $345,878,010.
While during the neriod from March I, 1897,
to March 31. 1UO4. the excess of exports of
merchandise over imports of merchandlna was
$l,017.u75.U77. California, according to the
figures, took no part In this most wonderful
increase, for the imports at San Francisco
for the years ISO" to 11)03, Inclusive, were
$^57,5a;Â»,112, while the exports during ihe same
period were $257,737,020, or the excess of ex
ports of merchandise over imports of aonly
S10S.50S. But, poor a.s this showing is, I con
fidently look forward to a more hopeful and
promising future.
OUR GREAT COMMERCE.
Clark sailed tlie splendid battleshlo Oregon
over 11, W0 miles from ocean to ocean in time
to participate in the battle at Santiago, and
in the quickest time that any warship ever
made In .so long a cruise. ,",r
â¢ Already we can meet all of ' the require
ments of our commerce, whether for shlos of
wood or iron.. And In this Â¦ particular Indus
try, to use the language cf the street, we will
pet take a back Beat for any of the States
is the Union or for any country on the face
of the (lobe. ' The most magnificent demon
stration of the quality and character of the
jblps we can build was . given when ' Captain
We stand first In the manufacture of beet
sugar and. owing to our nearness to the
Hawaiian Islands and their supply of raw ma
teriel, we have pushed ourselves to the fifth
rank in cane sugar refining. We produced in
the State of California in 1800 lumber and
timber of the value of *13.784,Gi7, and of this
amount the sixty-six mills of Humboldt and
ilendocino counties produced redwood lumber
ar.d shingles of the value of $4,665,636.
We stand first in the value of explosives,
the value of the Droduct being (4,283.818. We
rank first In the production of quicksilver,
most of the production of the United States
coming frcm our State. Practically all of the
borax produced In the United States comes
frsm California, and the value of this product
for 1902 was $2,370,694. In 1902 there were
over 5979 single track mileage of steel rail*
ways in California and 830 miles Â¦ of eleotric
railways. We rank third among the States of
the Union in shipbuilding, and are only sur
passed by, the great States of â¢ New York and
Pennsylvania.
VARIED PRODUCT'S.
But striking and gratifying as this agri
cultural development is. we have achieved
even greater things In manufactures. The
manufacturing development of the United
States Is the most remarkable chapter in the
world's history, and we citizens of California
have a right to think that the most, remark
able par* in this remarkable chapter is that
which records the industrial: history of our
own State. There is mucb about it which can
nowhere be equaled. It has been sul generis
along lines determined by our peculiar 'and
isolated location, the distinctive result of our
own natural resource*. PhuB off, from 2 the
great markets of the country by trans
continental distances, largely dependent upon
ourselves for supplies, paying higher wages
than are paid anywhere else? handicapped by.
the excessive cost of fuel until the past year
or two, handicapped also by a lack of many
Important raw Â¦ materials, wÂ« have pushed
steadily forward until we have made ourselves
more nearly self-sustaining, more completely
Independent of other people, than any country
In the world. Nature has done much for us,
but -we huve done quite as much for ourselves.
With an Invested capital, of- $206.3M,025, we
produced In the year 1900 a manufactured
product of the value of $302,874,701. â¢ But,
gratifying an this may be, there are much
brighter prospects for the development of our
manufactures In tha future. As I said before,
we have beea . handicapped In the past by tha
excessive cost of fuel, but with the discovery,
of fuel oil and the remarkable long distance
transmission of electrical energy, we bid fair,
before long, to take first rapk as a manu
facturing State. When I say to "you to-night
that three and a half barrels of fuel oil are
equivalent to a ton of the best Welch anthra
cite coal, you can readily understand, taking
into consideration the present market valuo
of this oil. what this means from a manu
facturing- standpoint. During the year 1902.
according to bulletin No. 9 of the I>cpartment
of Commerce and l^ahor. we produced In the
Slat* of CaUfornia 13.964.268 barrels of oil,
containing forty-two gallon* to the barrel. But,
owing to the discovery of new fields and the
sinking of many new wells, the output for
the year 1904 will more than double that of
1902, thus placing us ahead of Indiana and
making us the fourth State In the production
of petroleum.
MANUFACTURING PROGRESS.
In th< meantime our other resource*, which
pri.mtee a more substantial and satisfactory
basis of prosixnty than mining alone could
ever supply have been developed through the
energy, the" enterprise and push of our citl
ztn?. and to-day the value of our agricultural
aiiÂ«i manufactured products is more than fiÂ»
ti-en times the value of our mining products,
ii.cluulng petroleum. We rank seventh of the
a-.atea In farm area, having more than -S.0O0.
<XÂ«' acres of land under cultivation. In 1900
C-lifornia realized from *er farms and or
chards over H18.O00.U0O. and of the flls.COO.-
Uiu thus produced over $2S,000,COO. or nearly
24 per cent, consisted of fruits alone, and
comprised seven-eighths of all of the sub
tioptcal fruits grown in the United States.
But perhtps it might not be annas to give
you some figures showing the products of our
California farms and orchards. At one tune
California was the great wheat-growing State
of the Union, but we have been gradually sur
pass*.! by other State*, and from a produc
tion of 45.097.195 bushela In 1SÂ»6 we fell to
20.920.132 bushels in 1903. ThÂ« State of
Washington la running us a close, race. In
1S82 Washington produced 2, +40. 000 , bushels
of wheat and In 1003 she produced in.9S0,343
tuÂ»hclsâ almost the eame quantity that was
produced in the State of California. California,
however. Â«tandÂ» first In the States of the
Union in the production of barley, and she
stands pre-eminently first in the production of
all of the sub-tropical fruits. We can pro
duce In this Stats t.11 of the raieins consumed
tn the United States.
In 1S70 we produced about J200 boxes of
raisins, of the value of thirteen hundred odd
dollar* and In 1903 we produced 5.Â»>00,(XiO
boxer, 'of the value of I5.58B.5O0. In 1SS3 we
produced 1.6U1.019 bushels of peaches, or 4.<J5
per c<-nt of all the peaches produced in the
United States; but in 1S99 we produced 8.5G.1,
427 bushels, or 65.49 per cent of all of the
peaches produced in the United States. In
1SK9 we produced 5,632,036 bushels of plumo
and prunes, or about C5 per cent of all of the
plums and prunes produced in the United
States; 1.1)12.825 bushels of pears, or 28.87 per
cent of all of the pears grown in the United
States; 3.882.193 boxes of oranges, or 05.32
per cent of all of the oranges grown in the
United .States; 874,300 boxes of lemon*, or
9U.70 per cent of all of the lemons grown in
the United States; and nuts cf the value of
il, 441, 137. or 74 per cent of all of the nuts
grown in the United States.
California to-day in the greatest grape
growing State in the Union. In 1900 there
were 187 establishments engaged in the pro
duction of vinous liquors, and the value of
the product was $3,037,871. We are the first
wine State in the Union, and our wines are
of so high a quality and eo rare a flavor that
they compare favorably with the choicest vint
ageH of Europe. So, too. we have taken the
first rank among the States of the Union
in the great modern industry of fruit and
vegetable cannong, and over thirteen million
dollars' worth of these fruits go Into cans
every year.

audience standing, cheering, waving
handkerchiefs and drinking his health.
Hf was evidently pleased and at once
began his response.
SECRETARY SPEAKS.
The address of Secretary Metcalf
v.as. in full, as follows:
There Is nothing that warms a CaJlXornian's
heart so much as a California greeting, and
rtich a greeting: I have received to-night at
your hands. 1 appreciate your courtescy; I ap
preciate this evidence cf ycur good will and I
appreciate the epirit that has animated you
in assembling here. I thank you lur this
Â¦rcSeOHML this more than cordial reception, and
especially do I thank you for th* opportunity
U.ua afforded me of saying sumething to you
concerning the resources of our t^tate, it!"
growth and development and the bright pros
pects that are ;n *tore for it in the lulure.
The development cf California in the past
has been rao?t remarkable, perhaps more so
than the development of any other State in
thi Union. Our commonwealth, which was
the thirty-flrst of the forty-flve Stale* tn the
order cf admission to the Union, now Ftands
twenty-first m population, fourteenth in value
of agricultural product* and twelfth in valuo
of manufactures, and there 1* no Stato In
the Union with a population approximately
Â«-i,ual that approaches us In the value of the
products of farm and factory combined.
For a long time after the discovery of gold
upon the Pacific Coast CaUfornia was regarded
by the rest of the world as a great mining
cj.mp, d?pen<5e.nt chiefly upon her output of
geld and silver for a growth, which wa*
sometimes stigmatized as mushroom in its
character. But recent years have changed all
that. The mining camp Ion? since became a
settled and prosperous community whose varied
activities extend into all fields of industry,
and the reputation of our State no longer rests
st k-iy upon the products of its mines. In
ched as a producer of precious metals Colo
rr.do' now far outranks us. producing almost
twice as much gold and silver as we do. In
l:>0^ /our mines produced about 51Â«,i9-..OW
woith of gold, constituting over ooÂ»-Mtn o. the
product of the United Statf*. and tae total
pi eduction of our State from the year in

THE GUARDIAN OF OUR BODY.
The foremost biologist of our day,
II. MetschnikoST, has. shown the world
of science that there are leucocytes in our
blood that act as scaTengers or policemen.
These policemen which are called phago-
cytes look oct for tbe noxious or poisonous
elements in ocr blood. Various offending'
elements are picked oat of the blood and
tissues by these policemen and destroyed.
Therefore our lives are protected by
rhewr blood-cell : policemen, the phagocytes,
and we enjoy immunity from disease so
i Ivzg as our blood contains plenty of phago-
cytes and red blood corpuscles.
'"A new broom sweeps dean" â and in
order to put ocr own house in order we
taust get rid of all the poisons in the blood
Â¦nith a new broom each zm an alterative
extract mads from roots and herbs-ywith-
out the use of alcohol, as Dr. Pierce's
Golden Medical Discovery, a specific for
xuakiogrrich red blood â for eradicating the
poisons from the blood. In some way the
policemen in the blood are increased in
cumber and strength â so that we are put
in the best possible shape to res*t disease
â to core neuralgia, colds, catarrh, and in-
cipient consumption.
"The more study and time is given to the
r:;bject the more we find that the blood is
Che center of life "âsays Dr. IL V. Pierce,
tiie noted specialist of Buffalo, "the health
atid comfort of the average person depends
entirely on this blood supplyâ for the heart
must have pore blood or it will not pnmp
aid keep Jthe body supplied regularly like
thq beautiful automatic engine it is. The
n;rvcs must be fed on pure blood â or we
enffer the pain cf neuralgia,' which is the
cry of the starved nerves- for food. Head-
e~bes, cold in the hcad/catarrh-^and many
other things are due to stagnation " of the
blood."

The application of the proceeds of public
land sales to the reclamation of Irrigable por
tions of our arid and semi-arid public domain
meets my cordial approval. Through the en
lightened policy thug established under the
present administration the long-deferred hopes
of the struggling eettlers of the great arid
and seml-arld West will be realized in the
upbuilding of substantial communities In places
hitherto waste or comparatively unproduc
tive. At the same time a vast area of the
public domain will be opened up on which the
Industrious homeseekers, now residing- In over
crowded Eastern centers, may find homes. The
sum of over twenty millions of dollars, now
available In the reclamation fund, to which
additions are constantly being marie, guar
antees.- under â¢ wlse^ administration, great
progress In the work of Irrigation, and the

President Roosevelt has continued the work
In the same Just and generous spirit which In
spired President McKinley.
Military rule was quickly succeeded by the
civil authority. The people of the Islands have
been Invited as fast as possible to participate
In the work of government. The Judicial sys
tem has been Improved, corruption has been
driven out, public schools have been estab
lished and the people are already enjoying a
large measure of eelf-governmcnt.
Â¦ Congress has authorized a representative as
sembly to be chosen In due time by the people
of the Islands. The ballot-box Is not the sign
of Imperialism. No one need have any grave
concern with respect to the future of the
archipelago If the United States goes forward
as heretofore Inspired by the same lofty pur
pose which has characterized the administra
tions of President McKinley and President
Roosevelt. We may safely trust to the future
to deal with the Filipinos In a manner con
sistent with thel r highest and best interest and
with the duty and honor of the United States
The,^ people of the islands have had abun
dant evidence of the exalted purpose of the
United States. The. various degrees of civil
ization among them, their unfn nilliarity with
civic duties, made It lnadvlsablo to indulge
In any declaration as to future policies
which may lead to misunderstanding-. The
people of the Philippines do not distrust us
We need not distrust ourselves.
The archipelago came to the United States
as the result of a war and 1 it became the duty
of the administration to enforce the laws there
as elsewhere, to maintain the national sov
ereignty and to Inaugurate civil government.
Before the Insurrection had ceased President
McKinley admirably expressed our purpose.
Said he:
"No effort will be reared to build up the
waste places desolated by war and long years
of mlsgtiverument. We shall not wait for the
end of strife to begin the beneficent work. We
shall continue as we have begun; to open the
schools and the churches, to set the courts
in operation, to foster Industry and trade and
commerce and in every way in our power to
make these people whom providence has
brought within our jurisdiction feel that it la
their liberty and not our power, their welfare
and not our gain, we are seeking to enhance.
Our flag has never waved over any community
but in blessing. I believe the Filipinos will
soon recognize the fact that it has not lost
Its gift of benediction In Its world-wide Jour
ney to their shores." ,
THE McKINLEY SPIRIT.
' The administration In the Philippines has
been dictated by a broad sense of duty. It ha*
not been subversive of our national Ideals, but
has been in conformity with the best tradi
tions of the reaubllc
The completion of this great work should be
left to the administration which has done so
much to carry It forward against formidable
obstacles abroad and vexatious opposition at
home.
He concluded the negotiations with Great
Britain for the abrogation of the Clayton-
Bulwer treaty. He negotiated a treaty with
the republlo of Colombia for the requisite
rights and franchises for the construction and
operation of a canal. Its ratification was
contemptuously refused by the Colombian Gov
ernment. Thereupon the people of Panama
renounced their allegiance to the parent gov
ernment and declared their ln0epe.ndence. The
President, acting within the limits of hla exe
cutive authority and In conformity with well
established precedent, promptly recognized
their independence. He negotiated a treaty
with Panama whereby the United States ob
tained the necessary rights and franchises for
building and operating the canal.
When the Insurrection occurred upon the
isthmus the President safeguarded American
Interests. He acted promptly, but deliber
ately; prudently, not rashly; firmly, not un
lawfully. He usurped no authority. He only
exercised that executive power which Is clearly
vested In him by the constitution and which
his predecessors had employed under similar
circumstances. If he had failed to appreciate
our riehts, or to act nrmly and promptly,
blood would have been shed and the rights
of American citizens would have been sacri
ficed and the construction of the canal would
have been indefinitely delayed.
The President in due time appointed a com
mission composed of eminent engineers and
men of practical experience to undertake the
work of constructing the canal as speedily as
practicable. There Is no longer any doubt
or uncertainty as to the enterprise. Its com
pletion Is now an assured fact and It will
stand as one of the memorable achievements
of the new century. ;
The President's course In Panama merits
the most generous approval. He dealt with a
delicate and difficult situation clearly within
our national rights in such a way as to make
possible the early completion of an Isthmian
canal which has Ions been demanded In the
Interest of our commerce and' the national de
fense.

PANAMA QUESTION.
Sound money is so vital to our welfare, bo
imoortant to our industrial development, that
we should let Its open enemies or â¢ negative
friends know that we abate nothing of our
determination to upholdand defend it.
Since 1830 we have improved the system
as well aa Increased the volume of our- cur
rency. We have now in circulation*-!!S2.521,
151.527. or $880,842,008 more than we had
*evcn years ago. The Increase has not been
due alone to the larger yield of gold, for
3262,<J59,C&0. or nearly 80 per cent of the In
crease, la composed of sliver and national bank
notes, which, under the Republican policy, are
essentially the equivalent of gold.
The convention very properly declared It "to
be thÂ« duty of the Republican party to uphold
the gold standard." There Is no more Im
portant duty than to maintain the stability
and the character of the money of the peo
ple. Their manifold exchanges should be ef
fected In a currency as free from blemish aa
the national integrity. The Republican party
has been essentially thÂ« guardian of the finan
cial credit of the country and the steadfast
support of a sound currency. It has main
tained the national credit and preserved the
BCundness of our monetary system against
persistent and powerful opposition.
The money question has soemed to be set
tled at various times, but the contest has
been revived by the enemies of sound money
whenever they have thought that they might
be successful. We should not relax our vlgl
lai.ee In upholding the Integrity of our cur
rency so long as a considerable element of
our country are at war with It. When Demo
cratic candidates cannot hope to win preferment
In a national convention without Industriously
concealing- their monetary views, when Demo
cratic national and State conventions dare
not declare their faith In the virtue of the
gold standard, the hour has not arrived when
the forces of Bound money should disband
and leave the field, i
We not only established the gold standard,
but we provided such safeguards as will
maintain our silver and paper currency at a
parity with It. But all of this may be
changed at any time by a hostile Congress or
endanrercd by an unfriendly Secretary of the
Treasury. Our past experience warns us that
It is onlv a question of time when those who
are always opposed to a wound monetary policy
will -again eeck to overthrow It.
The Republican convention did well not only
to pledge anew our. fidelity to the gold stand
ard, but to declare Us purpose to uphold '^the
integrity and value of our national currency."
There should be no equivocation or doubt as to
our ipflexlblc purpose, not only to maintain
the gold standard, but to keep all silver and
paper currency at a parity with It.
The assumption that the Kold standard Is
"irrevocably established" . does violence to the
law. It was established by an act of Congress,
but the Concress may alter, amend or repeal
tlrat act at any time. It Is no more Irrevoca
bly established than are our tariff schedules.
The one may. be changed as readily as the
other. â¢ *.
THE GOLD STANDARD.
The Congress last year enacted a law to
expedite the hearing and determination of suits
arising under the anti-trust and Interstate
commerce acts, 50 that the ends of Justice
might not be defeated by delay. It created
the Department of Commerce and Labor, with
authority to obtain necessary information with
resrect to the creation and operation of cor
pcrations engaged in Interstate commerce. It
also amended the' Interstate commerce law so
effectually as to abolish the pernicious sys
tem of rebates, under which large shippers
cculd crush their smaller competitors. These
ate Important, practical steps taken by a
Republican President and a Republican Con
gress for the protection of the people against
th<* encroachments of combined capital.
The Democratic party has done nothing to
ward safeguarding legitimate Interests and re
straining combinations effected , for extortion
or other improper purposes. It proposes as
a principal remedy for unjust combinations
to remove the tariff from trust-made goods,
thereby Inviting 1 the foreign producer to occupy
our home market In an attempt to regulate
oi:r own industries. It has assumed that the
S'.> railed trusts are either created or fos
tered by the tariff. The assumption Is fal
lacious. Trusts are found in free trade coun
tries and they control commodities In this
country which are upon the free list.
The Republican party Is more direct and
rat.onal. It docs not strike down good and
bad dike. It invokes the authority of Con
gress and the power of the courts to deal
with specific, well defined combinations In
restraint vt the rights and Interests of the
people. It Is as Insistent upon the protection
of capital employed In wholesale enterprise
as la preventing its use In contravention of
the public interests.
The platform appropriately recognizes com
binations of capital and labor as the out
growth of our economic development, and as
entitled to the equal protection and subject to
the like restrictions of the law.
The administration has enforced the Sher
man anti-trust act, which was of Republican
origin. In casea where combination* have been
formed in violation of Us provisions. The law,
which was regarded as Ineffective by a Demo
cratic administration, has been invoked by
the President against combinations In restraint
of wholesome commerce, .and It has been upheld
by the court*.
The American Commissioners desired to omit
the boundary dispute ot the two governments
and to proceed with the consideration of all
other questions, including reciprocity, but the
British Commissioners declined to proceed fur
ther while the boundary remained undeter
mined. Subsequently the Boundary Commission
was created and the boundary line ' has been
settled, but no agreement has been reached for
further consideration of the remaining ques
tions embraced In the protocol. It Is hoped
that the two governments may be able to agree
In due course to take up the subject of reci
procity with- Canada according to the princi
ples laid down In the Republican national
platform.

with Canada. That subject, together with the
Alaskan boundary and other matters, were

The development of the country during the
last forty-four years is a complete vindication
of the virtue and efficiency of a protective
cystem. Its benefits >iai%been diffused through
al! sections of the country and among all our
people. It has enlarged our home market until
it has become the greatest In the world. This
we should not unnecessarily surrender. We
have believed it to be a wise national policy
to preserve the American market for American
producers and to secure to our workingmen
an Increased waire scale.
In 1S60 the value of our exports and manu-'
factures wan $40,345,892. Twenty years later
It was $102,856,015, and last year $452,415,629.
The pretension of its opponents that the pro
tective tariff la inconsistent with the - exten
sion of our foreign commerce Is thus Â¦ denied
by actual results. In considering the effect of
the â¢ respective tariff policies of the Republican
ud Democratic parties we are fortunately able
to consult past experience. What a revenue
tariff will accomplish we know, for we have
hitherto ' seen how it has arrested Industrial
development and embarrassed. enterprise to, the
Injury of both labor and capital. Neither es
capes Its blighting effects.
Commercial reciprocity with - foreign coun
tries "consistent with the principles of pro- Â¦
HUtory abundantly shows that the greatest
Industrial development of the country has oc
curred during the period when the protective
tariff has been maintained and that during
thl* time labor has received Its largest re
wards and capital has been most profitably
engaged.
A revision of duties should be made only
when conditions have to chanired that the
public interest demands tlieir alteration, and
they should be so revised as to preserve and
not destroy the prote<Ulve principle.
A revision and rÂ«luS^:on by thoe* who re
sard the tariff as a robbery must awaken seri
ous apprehension anone all whose capital is
employed or who are engaged at labor In the
various enterprises throughout the country,
which depend In larre measure upon the
maintenance of the protective wystem. A re
vision of the tariff along revenue lines means
the increased Importation of the products of
foreign manufacture which come Into compe
tition with our domestic production. It means
a loss to the American wage earners and to
American capital. This Is, therefore, not a
theoretical question which is presented to
them, but is one of immediate end practical
moment. It can be settled by them, and
by them only. â¢Â» -
The issue Is thus distinctly made. It is by
no means a new one. for while the Republican
party has uniformly adhered to the policy of
protection, the Demoratlc party has been con
sistent in Its opr>osltion. It has held to the
doctrine of a revenue tariff, and durinr all
the years of the contest has maintained that
the protective system was opposed to good
morals, in contravention of the constitution
and In \iolatlon of sound economics. The
objections which are now urged against It are
only a repetition of those which have found
utterance for many years. The difference be
tween the parties Is radical and fundamental.
It involves the principle of protection and not
simply the measure of the duties to be laid.
REVISION OP DUTIES.
The Democratic convention which lately as
eembled at St. Louis denounced "protection as
a robbery of the many to enrich the few."
and favored a. "revision and gradual reduction
of the tariff."
This principle was embodied In the platform
of tho convention which first nominated
Abraham Lincoln, and It has continued to hi
one of the cardinal doctrines of the Republican
party during the forty-four years which have
elapsed since then. It has been incorporated
into the public law and hau become the founda
tion of mir industrial system. It has been re
garded by the Republican party as a reason
able and appropriate exercise of the legislative
power when Imposing duties upon imports to
discriminate In favor of American industries.
This principle in dictated by a due regard for
our own enterprise and Industry, and Is
founded upon the highest considerations of na
tional Interest.
The convention wisely declared In favor of
"protection which guards and develops our
industri-en." and that "the measure of pro
tection should alwavs at least equal the dif
ference In the cost of production at home and
abroad."
Our relations with the world were never
better. We have avoided all entangling alli
ances and, in the language of the eminent
Secretary of State, "we are without an ally
and without an enemy."
j Events In tVe Far East suggest the wisdom
{ and necessity of a continuance of the present
i foreign policy. We have maintained exact
neutrality between Russia and Japan. At the
beginning of the war between them they as
sented to the suggestion made by the admin
istration, limiting the zone of hostilities. This
tends to preserve the open door in the Orient
so Important and so much desired in the ex
pansion of our commerce. It is the policy of
the administration, predicated upon the sound
est national prudence, to settle and remove by
trf-aty. so far as popslbl*, those International
differences which might lead to future friction.
We favor the adjustment of international
disagreements by an appeal to reason rather
than tc arms. A gr*at majority of the ques
tions which ariss between nations may, with
out compromising the national honor, be sub
mitted to arbitration. The administration of
President McKinley did well to aid In the
creation of The Hague tribunal, and Presi
dent Roosevelt is entitled to great credit for
being the flnrfc to Invoke its Jurisdiction In the
settlement oC the Pious fund cases.
PRESENT FOREIGN POLICY.
The foreign policy of the administration has
been conservative. Just and firm, and has
made for the advancement of peace. Time
and events have riven us a larger place In
international aftalrs. While we have enlarged
our foreign commerce, we have Increased our
prestige abroad, not with the sword but
through the peaceful agency of enlightened
diplomacy.
Thirty treaties have been, concluded and
proclaimed and stand to the credit of the ad
ministration. Some of these are of far-reaching
Importance. Among the number are the Hay-
Paunoeforte treaty, superseding the Clayton-
Bulwer convention, which stood in the way of
the construction of an isthmian canal; the
Panama canal treaty, the Alaskan boundary
treaty, and commercial treaties with China
and with Cuba.
The convention did well In its hearty com
mendation of the administration of President
Roosevelt. This is sharply challenged by the
opposition. We accept the issue with con
fidence. The President assumed the responsi
bilities of Chief Executive with a pledge to
carry out the policy of his beloved and la
mented predecessor. He kept the Cabinet of
President McKinley, composed of statesmen of
eminent ability. In whom the country placed
entire confidence. He carried forward the un
completed work faithfully and successfully.
The pledge has been kp"t scrupulously; the
promise has been fulfilled. Peace and good
order have been maintained. Domestic and
forelrn trade have Increased and relations of
amity have bet-S preserved with foreign
powers.
Â¦Â« e have had two administrations In the
l*Â»t seven years which have been eoverned
by the same policies. We may consult . the
trade reports In vain to discover when the one
endr.d and the other bezan. Both were
obliced to make vast expenditures for much
needed public works. The rapidly expanding
needs of the Government business must be
noet. The national equipment must keep pace
with oar national growth, yet always with
due regard to the principles of sound economy
in public expenditure. We have pursued no
parsimonious policy on the one hand nor in
dulged In extravagance on the other. We
have measured the public expense by the public
necessity.
The utterances of political parties must be
interpreted In the Hcht of that practical con
struction which they have put upon them
v.hen intrusted with power. It Is not alone
what they say, but what they will do which
should weigh In determining their capacity
to administer public affairs.

BELGRADE, Servla, Sept. 21.â
Peter Karageorgevitch was crowned
King of Servia to-day. There were no
hostile demonstrations and no attempt
to carry out the numerous threats
against the new King's life.
Here and in every garrison town of
Servla the dawn of the day was
marked by a salute of twenty-one guns
and before the sun was well up King
Peter, on horseback, rode out from the
palace. The procession then started
for the Cathedral through the troop
lined streets. The royal heralds,
cavalry and life guards (the heralds
bearing the royal standards) and car
riages with the Montenegran and Ser
vian Princesses precededHhe monarch.
Beside King Peter rode his two son3,
George and Alexander.
As King Peter entered the Cathedral
] the Metropolitan consecrated him and
more artillery salutes were firetl. The
King then took up his position under
a canopy and the Metropolitan, assist
ed by many Bishops and other clergy,
commenced the solemn service, the
choir singing "Thank Thee, Our Lord."
After the prayer the, Premier and
other Ministers handed the crown and
regalia to King Peter. He kissed the
crown, placed it on his head and robed
himself in the royal garments. An ar
tillery salute of 101 guns then an
nounced to the people of Belgrade that
King Peter had been crowned.
Wearing the crown on his head and
fully robed the King left the Cathe
dral, remounted his horse and rode
through the crowded streets to the
palace. There, in the grand festal hall.
King Peter received the congratula

others, ascended the royal throne and
once more took the sceptre and orb
in his hands. The ceremony of ren

Better is Francisca In the fioriture
stuff, in which, forgetting the spirit of
the song, one may simply joy in the
voice. She gave first the well known
aria from "Traviata," chiefly remark
able for the length, breadth and thick
ness of the trill. Like Kubso with his
top notes, Francisca is generous with
her trills, that are sometimes good and
sometimes not. But it is an extraor
dinarily flexible voice. The Massenet
"Elegie" followed, in French better
than the singer's Italianâ that has fil
tered in by way of the Dutch apparent
ly. Best is her German and. curiously,
Francisca sang the difficult Strauss
"Stanchen" most pleasingly of her pro
gramme, with eympatny and dramatic
appreciation. The De 1'Acq.ua "Villan
elle," the Proch "Variations," the Mey
erbeer "Le Pardon dÂ« Ploermel" and
the mad scene from "Lucia" were florid
numbers, all distinguished by the same
unsatisfying vocalizing, uncertainly in
tonated upper notes, monotonous read
ing and ravishing beauty of tone.
Mme. Francisca was accompanied by
Melville Ellis, the Beau Brummel of
the Tivoli. Mr. Ellis' accompaniments
were as clever as his accordion pleated
shirts. They were sympathetic, dis
creet and generally efficient. In his
solo, an arrangement of Charpentier's
"Louise," Mr. Ellis discovered an easy
technique and a notable dramatic sym
pathy. Louis Newbauer's flute play
ing in the German suite came delight
fully. He was ably seconded by Mr.
Ellis. He also accompanied the singer
in the "Lucia" "mad scene." But Mr.
Newbauer's flute or any other has no
chance against the Francisca voice.
For the simple beauty of it it should be
heard> She gives another programme
on Saturday afternoon.
BLANCHE PARTINGTON.
Technically there are all sorts of ob
jections â muddy vocalizing, indifferent
breath control, faulty enunciation, pro
nunciation and interpretatively matters
are worse. Take the "Home, Sweet
Home," for example, of which as an
encore . the singer gave a dramatized
version. One permits a Sembrlch to
warble "no place lak home," but these
and similar errors in English are hard
ly permitted to the â¢ American-born
singer. The phrasing of the ballad was
singularly bad and the whale thing sen
timentalized out of all resemblance to
the simplicity that is its chiefest
charm.
One of the most beautiful voices ever
heard here, and one of theÂ»most ex
asperating methods of using it, are
those of Mme. Fannie Francisca, the
California singer, who reappeared here
last night at the Alhambra after an
nbsence "f twelve years. A large audi
ence welcomed her, and was patriot
ically generous of its applause.
Much was expected of Mme. Fran
cisca. For the last three years she
has been the prima donna soprano of
the Opera Royal at Amsterdam.
Paris has approved her â I have seen
notices in Le Gaulois and Figaro that
would not have been disdained by a
Melbaâ and the singer has been gen
erally recognized. So far as the voice
Is concerned it is true that one could
not easily be over-enthusiastic. It is
of extraordinary beauty. The fortes
are full, sweet, round and intensely
penetrating, the pianlssimos almost as
Bilkily fine as Melba's own. The qual
ity is even from end to end, and of a
peculiar llquldness. The range is large,
with low notes of fascinating beauty.
In fact, one needs to hear no finer
voice. It is to its use that one must
object.

"General Kuroki fell upon the left

was completely surprised. His troops,
composed mainly of reservists who
had been long out of the service, .were
uncontrollable and broke, going in the
direction of Yentai instead of back to
the mines.
BERLIN, Sept. 22. â A dispatch
from St. Petersburg to the Tageblatt.
apparently prompted by the Russian
War Department, put the blame for
General Orloff's failure to hold the
Yentai coal mmes equally upon Vice
roy Alexieff and General Orloff. The
correspondent' says:
"Alexieff detained Orloff on trivial
pretexts so that he reached the mines
at noon on September 1. wholly un
informed as to the situation. General
Samsonoff transmitted to him General
Kuropatkin'F strict order to hold the
mines at all costs, but when Orloff
heard the cannonading in the direc

that place, leaving Samsonoff alone to
hold the mines.

GARDINER, Mont., Sept. 21.â Four
hundred dollars in gold currency were
found to-day in the railroad embank

wrapped up in an old sock and placed
there early in the spring. This sock 13
part of a cache made by D. W. Dwight.
who entered the saloon of Tripp &
Melloy April 27 and rifled the safe of
nearly a thousand dollars in gold, and
currency and Jewelry to the value of
$200. .
After the burglary Dwight left the
city and went to Livingston, where he
began drinking heavily and flashed a
hundred-dc-llar bill in payment for
drinks. The bartender grew suspicious
and notified the sheriff, who had the
prisoner shadowed. He was arrested
at Fridley and had in his possession
the stolen jewelry and a complete bur
glar's kit. During his trial Dwight
said that he had hid the money in two
socks on the railroad embankment, but
said he could not remember the exact
place. Diligent search was instituted
at the time at the- place designated by
the prisoner, but all efforts to recover
the money proved unavailing. The
matter was dropped until to-day, when
Dan Tripp, with a miner, we*nt to the
scene with the intention of making a
systematic search by digging up a
large portion of the embankment.
They had been searching about five

PARIS, Sept. 21.â A dispatch to the

"The Russians executed reconnais
sances on Monday* which developed

NEW YORK. Sept. 21.â "William
Nelson Chomwell. counsel of the Pan
ama Canal Commission, offered me the
Presidency of the new republic of Pan
ama if I would start the revolution."
Such is the extraordinary statement
which was made by J. Gabriel Duque,
editor of the Panama Star and Herald,
who arrived here to-day.
"But I did not accept," Duque con
tinued, "and Mr. Cromwell did not pay
one cent to bring about the revolution,
though he did make promises that we
would have the help of this Govern
ment. It has been said that I had an
agreement with Secretary Hay. This
is false. But we knew that the United
States would not allow Colombians to
enter if we seized the reins of govern
ment.'

GENOA, Sept. 21.â The men and offi
cers of the American cruiser Baltimore,
which arrived here last week to coal
and go into dry dock, have seen Genoa
this time under tragic circumstances.
When the strike was at its worst
Commander Briggs called on the pre
fect and put his men, some 350 in num
ber, at the latter's disposition in case
of need.
I noticed that while mobs forced the
foreign consulates generally to take in
their flags, that on the American con
sulate continued to wave.
Saturday was the worst day. Violent
meetings were held in the morning
and after the speeches the crowd dis
persed through the city, creating terror
and havoc in many directions.
American Consul W. H. Bishop had
iEsued invitations that cfternoon to
meet the officers of the Baltimore, but
most of the guests were prevented ven
turing out by the insecure conditions on
the streets and the lack of conveyances.
Mrs. Seymour, wife of Lieutenant
Seymour, was kept indoors at the Hotel
Ifotta. Mrs. Clinton, wife of Lieuten- ,
ant Clinton, together with Lieutenant
Clinton** mother and Miss Anna Evans
and Mrs. Hope of New York, were de- '
tained at their hotel and other Ameri
cans at different hotels and in subur
ban towns were prevented continuing
their journeys.
The Daily Telegrapn's Chefu cor
respondent says that Japanese official
circles had thought that the fall of
Port Arthur would be coincident with
the Mikado's birthday, November 3. but
that they admit it has been postponed
until spring.
"It is significant." the correspondent
adds, "that winter quarters are being
prepared at Dalny. When Newchwang
is frozen Dalny will be the main base
of the whale operations.
"It is reliably stated that General
Nogi. in command of the Japanese
forces about Port Arthur, is preparing
a new scheme of attack, involving an
assault not upon the whole line, but
upon the commanding positions, it be
ing essential to speedily secure nurre
forts in order to enable the Japanese
to hold their present advantage."
LONDON, Sept. 22.â According to the
Morning Post's Japanese correspondent,
two of the Port Arthur forts the Japan,
ese are said to have occupied in the
vicinity of Shiushiylng are Nantsai and
Cbangkiatun, and their value to the
besiegers consists in the former being
close to the Antushan forts and the
latter to Dragoon Hill forts, the object
of the Japanese being to thrust a pow
erful wedge In the gap between the
eastern and western fortifications,
through which the railway passes to
Port Arthur from the north. Antushan
overlooks this gap and, though the Jap
anese failed to penetrate it sufficiently
in the assault of three weeks ago, the
persistency with which they returned
to the charge Is held to prove that the
taking of the gap is as essential to the
Japanese plan of campaign as it was a
decade ago.
According to the Daily Mail's Chefu
correspondent, the Japanese at Port
Arthur have mounted additional guns
on positions captured in the last as
sault. An attack from the sea, the
correspondent says, is now less effec
tive, owing to the eonitnual high angle
fire having serlouslj' affected the heavy
guns of the blockading fleet.
The correspondent at Tientsin of the
Daily Telegraph says that Japanese
gunboats have left Yinkow preliminary
to a^renewed and, it is said, final at
tack'on Port Arthur.
Wonderful things are being done by the
staffs of the different hospitals at Port Ar
thur, who are assisted by ladles. There are
thirty nurses for each 1000 patients. The
ladies devote mest of their time to the mak
ing of clothes for the soldiers. The laundry
work is done by poor women and the wives
of enlisted men. The sick and wounded are
thus kept supplied with clean clothing. The
laundry work has to be done In dreadful heat.
There are no contagious diseases at Port
Arthur, but many deaths are resulting from
the bite of a large red-headed flv, which feeds
on the. decomposing corpses scattered over the
battlefields. A doctor who was bitten on the
thumb by one of thesÂ» file? Instantly severed th*
member. He then had his arm amputated,
but not befora the poison had reached his
heart. The result of the bite was fatal.
Every day In the week the band plays at
one of the hoFsltals.
The wounded men . recover quickly from the
wounds Inflicted by maxim projectiles and by
the bullets of the Ohska rifle, but the wounds
resulting from explosive bullet* are awful,
and recovery Is Impossible.
The o!d town of Port Arthur is almost en
tirely wrecked. The .streets are filled with
holes made by exploding shells. The loss of
life In Port Arthur from the bombardments
has been remarkably small. Once I counted
fifty-seven Japanese rhclls fired at a Russian
bcttery. not one of whl'-h reached Its mark. â¢
The Russian garrison is cheerful. It wraiM
b? impossible to Imagine a braver or finer
ppt of men. They return from three days'
duty In the trenches with songs on their lip*.
Although many . places In the ranks are va
tant all the men have unlimited confidence
In their power to hold the fortress against
the enemy.

will stand acalnst thf Japanese; I do not think

CHEFU, Sept. 21. â Mrs. Anna
Kravtchenko/ the English wife of a
Russian army officer, who arrived on
the night of September 17 with Lieu
tenant Prince Radzivil from Port Ar
thur, is. the first woman to run the
blockade from the Russian stronghold
since the Japanese increased their
vigilance to prevent egress from the
port. Her trip was rendered extremely
perilous because she came out with
the Prince and his companion. Lieu
tenant Christoforoff, who carried mes
sages from Lieutenant General Stoes
sei, the commander at Port Arthur, to
General Kuropatkin. Both these offi
cers were disguised and had they been
captured by the Japanese they cer
tainly, would have been executed. Mrs.
Kravtchenko said:
We left Port Arthur at 8 o'elock on the
night of September 15. There was a good
wind and the moon was bright. We wÂ«re guc
ctsaful in avoiding dancer of the first Japan
ese blockading line. We came up to the
second. line when the moon whs under a cloud.
Searchlights were flashing on aU aides, but our
junk wos not discovered.
'At <> o'clock the next mornins we saw a
steamship coming: In our direction. She had
th? appearance of a cruiser and I was ter
ribly frightened. When we saw .the cruiser
Prince Radzivil and Lieutenant Chrlstoforoft
went below. I stretched myself out on deck and
covered myself with dirty blankets. Chinese
were lying at my feet and at my sides, and
for nearly an hour, although nearly smothered,
I kept my position. I never uttered a more
thankful prayer than when I was Informed
that the steamship we had seen was a Red
Cross -vessel and that her captain had no In
tention of overhauling us.
' ST. PETERSBURG', Sept. 21. â Gen
eral Kuropatkin, telegraphing under
yesterday's date, declares. that the sit
uation dt the .front is unchanged. He
describes an outpost fight -on Tuesday
at Da Pass, half way between Bentsia
putze and Sintsintin. AÂ«. Japanese
force, consisting of four companies,
marched up from Dziantchan, twenty
three miles northeast of Saimadzi, and
tried to capture the pass and turn the
Russian left . flank, but the Russians
repulsed the .attack and the turning
movement was checked by Russian
cavalry, supported by machine guns.

Movable huts are Quite unsuitable
for the housing of the Japanese, ow
ing to the severity of the climate. The
average winter temperature is forty
degrees below zero and the cold is in
tensified by continual winds and an
almost entire absence of snow. In
spite of this, however, the campaign
probably will continue during the
winter, if the Japanese succeed in get
ting into Mukden. In this contingency
General Kuropatkin, for various rea
sons, will not be likely to allow the
Japanese to remain in undisturbed
possession of this point, which is im
portant not only from a strategical,
but from, a political point of view.
A resumption of the Japanese ad
vance is now expected to occur any
day. It is the third week since the
fighting at L.iaoyang and the Japanese
have had time to transport reinforce
ments from Yinkow and brine up
sufficient men to the front to replace
their losses, but it is not improbable
that several days will intervene before
the armies come to close quarters.
The interval is being devoted on both
sides to feeling out the strength and
disposition of the opposing forces. The
Japanese probably will attempt to
capture the passes of the Da Mountain
range, running half way between the
Hun and Taitse river's. The posses
sion of these passes is important for
the Japanese, as it will not only en
able them to march northward, but
nlso screen the movements of their
troops from the prying gaze of Rus
sian ECOUtS.
It is fully appreciated here that. the
Japanese must try for the possession
of Mukden, as otherwise it will be dif
ficult for them to provide the army
with winter quarters. Liaoyang does
not afford sufficient accommodations,
although many houses escaped de
struction in the recent battle.
ST. PETERSBURG. Sept 22, 1:20
b. m.â There is further delay in the
decisive news from the front. The
situation at Port Arthur remains a
blank, though it is felt', that import
ant developments may be even now
occurring there. The movements in

The cure of a beautiful little girl,
whose picture heads this article Is an-
other distinct triumph for the Electro-
Chemic treatment. The little girl is
Rosa Solari. age seven years, the daugh-
ter of B. Solari of No. 4793 Telegraph
ave.. Oakland. Little Rosa suffered se-
verely from a catarrhal affection which
affected her in every way. but the most
serious effect was upon her ears. The
ears discharged foul and bad-smellinj?
matter, and the child could not hear. The
fact that she could not hear made it im-
possible for her to go to school with any
advantage, and it also affected her gen-
ernl health to such an extent that sh*
was miserable. ThÂ»- Wt side of the head
was painful: she was weak; she could
not eat, and shf had no disposition for
piny. The Klectro-Chemic treatment
helped her from the very start. In a
very short time all pain in the head had
left, the discharging from the ears
stopped, her appetite returned, and. best
of all. she hears perfectly, whereas
she was almost deaf before takinjc
th* Klectro-Ohemic course. Â¦ At a very
small expanse and in a very short time
the child has been perfectly cured. Her
parents are so delighted with the change*
in the little girl that they are only too
glad to make thi3 public acknowledg-
ment of the success of the Elt-ctro-
Chemif treatment in the serious case of
their little daughter. Any one Interested
in this caso is perfectly at liberty to call
upon the parents in regard to' it. And
thus the evidence is piled up. Grateful
patients are still giving public testimo-
nials of the remarkable curative effects
of Electro-Chemistry. These testimonials
are from well-known people and every
one is genuine. Electro-Chemistry Is th-Â»
only treatment known to science th.ir.
cures ringing head and ear noises. It 1*
the only treatment that cures chronic
discharging ears. It is the only treat-
ment that cures deafness with cer-
tainty. It seems strange that people
who have heard of the success of thÂ«
Electro-Chemic treatment in ear diseases
are still continuing to waste money and
time upon the old-style methods of treat-
ment, which are so uncertain and which
rarely ever cure. The Electro-Chemio
treatment is the most successful treat-
ment known for the cure of Consump-
tion. Catarrh. Asthma. Bronchitis. Rheu-
matism. Neuralgia, Locomotor Ataxia.
Paralysis, Falling Sickness, Epilepsy.
Dizziness. Headaches, Spots before tho

X-Riy Esarn I nation is the most re-
liable examination that any sufferer
can have nnd it is absolutely free,
to all. The Eloctro-Chemie homÂ«Â»
treatment is very successful and the pa-'

most successful treatment can b<* had.

Second in importance to the elec

dependent Order of Odd Fellows is the
deciding of the question as to where
to hold the' next session. That ques
tion came up for decision before yes

it lasted nearly three hours. After the

ihat Washington, D. C, had been the
selection of the majority and the Odd

Not an accident or unpleasant inci
dent marred the pleasure of the day.
The weather was nearly perfect. In
the early morning a haze hung over
the bay and shore, but about the time
the party started out the sun dispelled
this. As the boat pulled out from her
slip the band aboard playing patriot
ic airs the last trace of fog disap
peared.
The boat flrSt headed for the Gold
en Gate and from its decks the excur
sionists had a splendid view of the
water front and residences on the hill
sides. Passing: Angel and Alcatraz
islands and the frowning forts at
Black Point and the Presidio, the
guests looked out through the Golden
Gate and saw before them the broad
expanse . of the Pacific, calm and
peaceful as its name implies.
: Turning back, the steamer headed
for Mare Island, where the guests
aboard her had an excellent view of
the vessel whose unexpected arrival
in this harbor. caused speculation and
comment on two continents â the Rus
sian cruiser Lena, now stripped of her
fighting apparatus.
A stop of three hours was made at
Mare Island and the members of the
party were taken through the work
shops. . Many of them are from the
interior and found the visit to the
navy yard a liberal education. While
the party was inspecting the shops
the band which accompanied it gave
a concert of patriotic airs.
Every possible courtesy was shown
the visitors. Admiral McCalla enter
tained the members of the Sovereign
Grand Lodge at lunch. It was with
regret that the visitors again boarded
the Berkeley to return to this city.
The homeward trip was without In
cident. ". The sun shone brightly from
a cloudless ' sky and there was just
sufficient breeze blowing to make It
comfortable' aboard the boat. The
party passed close enough to Goat Isl
and to get a good view of the naval
training, station- there., A visit was
also made to the Union Iron Works.
The affair was managed by a joint
committee of .Odd Fellows and Re
bekahs jmade up as follows: Cap
tain Jones, who had charge of the
vessel: E.R. Moss, H. R. Wolff, R.
C. Stahle; E. Quintero. Mrs. G. Gress,
Miss E. Franklin and Mrs. Michaels.
One of the pleasantest features of
the encampment of the Odd Fellows
and one that will perhaps linger long
est in the memories of those fortunate
enough to enjoy it was the bay excur
sion yesterday on the big ferry-boat
Berkeley. At 9 o'clock a. m. the boat
pulled out, bearing at least 800 per
sons looking forward to a day of en
joyment. At 5 o'clock last evening 1 as
happy a group of excursionists as
ever stepped from steamer's deck to
shore was landed.

The first sound to break the stillness

honored women, then the audience
burst into applause, which' increased as
Miss Ilattie E. Haight of Indian Terri

vilion. There, while every corps stood
with bared, heads, they repeated after
Brigadier General ; H. O. Brower the
beautiful and solemn vows that arc
made upon receiving the decoration.
Slowly and solemnly the promise was
given 'to relieve distress, succor the
sick, comfort the bereaved, and help
wives and women," and although the
words of the speaker did not carry far,
the 'immense inclosure was silent dur
ing the ceremony. At last the final
words were reached, "I pledge my sa
cred honor," and General Brower .re
quested a. short prayer. The huge au
dience still remained silent while the
temporary grand chaplain, Peter Simp

VALLEJO IX LIXE.
This made the Vallejoites nervous
for a few moments, but they soon re
gained their steadiness. They executed
the manual of arms in excellent style
and went through the rest of the drill
well. Their turns were loudly ap
plauded and "right front into line" was
exceptionally well done. In dressing
line the files were inclined to shuffle and
move too slowly into position and the
experts made a note of this.
Watsonvllle's men were not far be
hind Vallejo in the manual of arms.
Th*>y erred slightly in the center, but
thr> experts were the "only ones who
noticed the technical mistakes. The
distances were not kept quite so well
as Vallejo kept them and in "mark
time" nart of the command was out
of step. As with all of the other corps
! the turns were good and the execution
of movements by three and sixes was
. carried out according to the strict line
i of the tactics.
The highest percentage is 100. Frac
tions of this percentage are to be de
ducted for errors. The prizes for cla>s
; A. which drills are to take place to-day,
are: First prize $250. second prize $150.
Class B: First prize $150, second prize
$100. Class C: First prize $100, second
i prize $50. The class A drill will be be
tween Sacramento and "Washington, D.
C. canton corps. If Washington wins
the additional sum of $750 will be
added to the first prize in accordance
with the special inducements offered
cantons outside of California, and to
the second prize will be added $350 if
Washington wins.
WOMEN RECEIVE HONORS.
On Friday there will be little busi
ness transacted by the Sovereign
Grand Lodge as tliat day is set asMe
for the parade. On Saturday will oc
cur-the installation of officers and the
appointment of the remaining officers
Over thirty reports from the States
were laid on the table to await the
action of: the Sovereign Grand Lodge.
This was in the course of routine busi
ness, and occupied only a short time.
The next event of importance was the
re'porting of names by the cantons and
departments, for the decoration of
chivalry. It was ordered that the dec
oration ; of the candidates for the
honor take place in the evening at Me
chanics' Pavilion. A second list was
submitted of candidates for the grand
decoration of chivalry, which ceremony
will take place to-night at Mechanics'
Pavilion.
WILL CONSIDER AMENDMENTS.
The next important business before
the session will be a special order, to
morrow, to consider the addition of an
amendment to the constitution to
change the age of entrance eligibility
to the order, from 21 to IS .years. The
constitution at present prescribes the
age of eligibility at 21. Â¦
Another, amendment that will cause a
sensation is in. relation to the color line.
It is rumored that there are several
representatives in the Sovereign Grand
Lodge who are in favor of admitting
members of the negro, Asiatic and In
dian race. Should this amendment be
proposed it would precipitate the big
gest fight in the history of the order.
Many of the representatives would vote
against admitting the Japanese whose
eligibility, would be guaranteed by the
new amendment, on the ground that
the order was not prepared to admit
members of an alien race.
Many representatives are in favor of
admitting negroes. This will be stren
uously opposed by the Southern dele
gates. The main question, however,
is the ; admission of Indians and In
dian half-breeds throughout the Jur
isdictions of Oklahoma and Indian Ter
ritory. The question came up through
the desire' of many Odd Fellows who
settled In the Territories and married
Indian squaws to have their sons ad
mitted . to the order. To bring about
this result it will be necessary to
amend the constitution. Many repre
sentatives will oppose this, as being
the first step toward the admission of
objectionable members of the Indian
race. ' -:,r -; | {
At 11:30 the balloting began and soon
it was announced that Washington, D.
C, had won by an overwhelming ma
jority. Buffalo, the dark horse of the
contest,, stood second on the list, fol
lowed closely by Philadelphia. The
votes for the various cities were as fol
lows: Washington 9S, Buffalo 20, Phila
delphia IS, New York 1G, Cleveland 14,
and Montreal 11.
Fully an hour was taken up in mak
ing seconding speeches and showing
why other cities should not be entitled
to the next session. One of the repre
sentatives said that if the delegates
were to meet In New York the mem
bers of the order would become lost

CANTONS GATHER.
Brigadier General H. O. Brower was
delighted with the result of yesterday's
day of competitive drills and inspec
tions. The most spectacular feature of
thÂ» evening's programme was the dress
parade and the conferring of the order
of chivalry by General Brower. In the
afternoon the competitive drills of four
cantons took place.
Assembly was sounded at 7 o'clock
in the evening, at which time every
canton representing the First and Sec
ond regiments, department of Califor
nia, was on the floor of the north wing
of the pavilion. In all there were about
S00 patriarchs militant ready for the

The Department of California shows
that there are nineteen cantons, eight

The crack canton of "Washington, D.

this contest, for It will be the only one
In which an Eastern canton will parti

yesterday. The lack of variety will
cause no complaint, however, for the

INFANT IS IMPRISONED
IN BURNING HAMMOCK
little Leroy Smith Probably Fatally
Burned and a Family Left
Destitute.
Imprisoned In a hammock. Leroy
Smith, an eight-month-old baby, was
probably fatally burned yesterday
when the tent of its father. J. J.
Smith, located at Twelfth and-Harri
son streets, caught fire. There were
three other children under the canvas
at the time, but they escaped with
slight burns. The mother of the un
fortunate baby was badly burned
about the face and hands when she
rushed to the rescue of her infant.
She was absent from the tent when
the fire started. She returned to find
the canvas shelter in flames and
heard the shrieks of her children from
within. Mrs. Smith rushed Into the
burning tent and dragged out the four
elder children.
The baby was wrapped in a ham
mock. When the frantic mother
reached the little one the hammock
was burning. Little Leroy was taken
to the Central Emergency Hospital,
where he lies at the point of death.
The flre leaves the Smith family
destitute. The father. J. J. Smith,
arrived in this city a few days ago
and established a temporary home un
der canvas. He 's a horse clipper.
ADMISSION TO COUNTRY
MADE EASY FOR CHINESE
Commissioner Rules That ETidence
Taken After Landing Is Not Ad
missible in Deportation Cases.
PORTLAND, Or.. Sept. 21. â By a
ruling of United States Commissioner
K. A. McKee the first statement of a
Chinese taken after his arrest for be
ing illegally within the boundaries of
the United States before the Chinese
Inspector or any inspector cannot be
used by the Government as evidence
against the Oriental.
The decision will have the effect of
making admission into this country
easy for a large number of Chinese, as
the Government has frequently relied
upon this evidence to secure deporta
tion, it having been found that the
Chinese were more likely to tell the
truth Immediately after arrest than
after they have had a chance to be
come posted by their countrymen.

Difficulties in the way of supply
ing this city with potable water from
the Sierra Nevada Mountains were set
forth yesterday by Chief Engineer
Schussler of the Spring Valley Water
Works before United States Commis
sioner Heacock.
He said that without the ownership
of the Crystal Springs reservoir prop
erties it would require, besides the
headworks and canals In the Sierra,
not less than five independent 'pipe
lines, each forty-eight inches in diam
eter, having a daily capacity of 30,
000,000 gallons each, accompanied by
at least one additional safety line of
the same diameter and capacity.
The ;electric pumping plants would
also have to .be correspondingly In
creased '. in number and capacity, so
as to bring them up from 30,000.000
gallons over one pipe line to an aver
age of 130i000, 000 gallons per day. In
order, to . have this average supply ca
pacity additional carrying capacity of
from 15 to 20 per cent must be pro
vided'for to meet the fluctuations be
tween ' the ' average and 'the maximum
daily consumption. Forthis purpose
four forty-eight inch pipe lines would
riot be able to carry this average, quan
tity,' but It would require five lines to
>do' it. Â¦ ;â¢ Â¦Â¦.â¢: Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦;' -Â¦-:-Â¦', : - : Â¦

William M. Bowers, chairman of the
committee In charge of Alameda's illu
minating- plant, are at outs. Wiese
affirms that Bowers has demanded his
resignation. The City Trustee asserts
he simply told the superintendent that
If he did not operate the department
the way the Trustees desired he might
as well quit. There has been friction
between Wiese and Bowers over the
plant and this was brought to a
head recently when Bowers "docked"
the salary of the superintendent $15

consent of the chairman. Wiese de
manded the money and filed a signed

Those who wish to visit the proposed
park site may secure tickets by calling
at the headquarters of the Board of
Trade at any time during the present
week. The Good Government Club will
hold a pro-bond meeting at the corner
of Cypress and Fifteenth streets to
morrow evening, to be addressed by P.
M. Fisher and J. J. Victory- The Pied
mont District Improvement Club has
come out in an earnest indorsement of
the bonds. The Northwestern Improve
ment Club was addressed by Edwin
Stearns in behalf of the bond3 last
night and has Indorsed the entire is
sue.
.During: the meeting Mayor Olney
came in and was asked to make a
statement. The Mayor said:
It may be of interest to know that the
Realty Syndicate has given me a guarantee
that it will sell to the city of Oakland any
Â«r all of the land In that neighborhood for
exactly what it coet, this cost to bo deter
mined and appraised by experts from the
Board of Trade, Merchants' Exchange or simi
lar organization*, whcr^will put experts upon
their books. It may be well for mo to re
mark here that the Realty Syndicate con
siders that it is Belling to the city of Oak
land the land embraced in the proposed park
at less than it cost them, and I believe that
this land Â»â¢?" never again be purchased so
cheaply as It la now offered to the city. In
other words, the people will be asked to vote
$300,000 for bonds for a park site and It will
be left to the city government to select from
all of the land in that neighborhood Just what
Is wanted.
Mayor Warren Olney holds an agree
ment by which the city of Oakland
may purchase any or all of the Sather
tract. or any of the surrounding lands
o-wned by the Realty Syndicate at the
actual cost of these lands to the syndi
cate. This statement was made by
Mayor Warren Olney at the meeting
of the general committee of citizens
held this afternoon to discuss the bond
issue that will be voted upon next
Tuesday.
The meeting was of the sub-commit
tees from the Board of Trade, Mer
chants' Exchange, tha trades unions of
Oakland and other organizations that
are Interested in tha advancement of
the city. Judge John Yule. was made
chairman and John T. Bell secretary.
Those present were: Board of Trade â
Hugh Hogan, J. Tyrrell and Emil Len
hart: Merchants* Exchangeâ A. Schlue
ter, W. H. Weilbye, D. C Brown and
G.W. Arper; Progress Federation â Dr.

pee; trades unionsâ C. W. Petrey; real
estate dealers â E. P. Vandercook, R.
A. Jackson, E. C. Sessions and W. J.
Laymance.
It took very little time to get down
to business. It was at once decided
that in view of the recent assertions
about the bonds. there -were two ques
tions to be answered: "Is the land pro
posed for Central Park suitable for
park purposes?" "Is the price asked
reasonable?"
Those present decided that the peo
ple of Oakland wanted the best evi
dence to be had upon the subject and
a telephone message was sent to Su
perintendent McLaren of Golden Gate
Park asking him If he would visit the
proposed park to-morrow morning with
the general committee. McLaren's an
swer was received while the committee
was in session. He promised to visit
Oakland to-morrow morning at 9
o'clock, go to- the proposed park site
and give Oakland the benefit of his ex
perience, gathered in the making of
Golden Gate Park. \"
Meanwhile the real estate men of
Oakland are preparing a table of the
values of land in that . neighborhood.
This table will be. issued to-morrow
and will Bhow that the actual sale price
of land in this neighborhood in the last
five years has been from $800 to 51200
an acre. > â¢-,v.- -;â¢.?>"Â¦ i

David Klniry. the suspected slayer
of Policeman James H. Smith, is
supposed to be in St. Louis. The
police have made a special request
through the department there to keep
a close lookout for the fugitive. It is
the belief of Detective Denny Holland
that Kiniry will be located in the
neighborhood of the Missouri metrop
olis, which was his home.
An even $1000 awaits the person who
shall cauae Kiniry's arrest. For nearly
a year the Oakland police have 'been
working to find some trace of the mur
derer. Not a substantial clew has been
obtained during all of the months that
have passed since Smith was killed
after placing Kiniry and his compan
ion Goldstein under arrest as suspected
burglars in the Lakeside district
In the battle Goldstein and Smith
both lost their lives. Kiniry, an athlete
and expert wheelman, mounted a bi
cycle and disappeared. This occurred
last November. Only three arrests have
been made of suspected men in the
United States since the excellent de
scription of Kiniry was sent broadcast
among the police departments and to
many other peace officers throughout
the country-
Kiniry, according to Detective Hol
land, had a fondness for mingling in
city life. Holland thinks that the St.
Louis attractions have been too strong
for the missing man to withstand.
Quietly a hunt has been made and will
be continued.

Mayor Olney delivered an address at
the "Booster Ball" and bond rally of
the Alumni Association of the Oakland
Polytechnic High School this evening,
explaining the items of the proposed
bond issue, and calling upon the mem
bers to. use their influence to aid in
carrying the improvement bonds. He
spoke particularly of. the Polytechnic
school, but said that no effort should be
spared to make the entire issue a suc
cess. :^ :
"The Influence of the members of
this association, if rightly directed, will
be of the greatest help to the bonds,"
said Mayor Olney, "and every member
should use his b#st effort to insure suc
cess at the coming election."
P. M. Fisher, principal of the Poly
technic school said: "The Polytechnic
High School is Jn a critical position at
present, and to insure success In Its
work, the school must have a modern
building, more teachers and better
equipment. The bonds, if carried, will
insure this Improvement and the mem
bers of this association should see to it
that they are carrieO."
School Director C. D. Rodgers also
spoke in favor of the entire bond issue.
The Civic Educational League.; held
an enthusiastic bond rally this evening
and adopted the following resolution
in favor of the bonds:
Whereas, The Civic Educational "* l>agne
stands for all that will aid in the advance
ment alone every line of the city of Oakland;
and whereas, the bond issue to be brought
before the public on September 27 stands for
theee ends; therefore be it
Resolved, That the Civic Educational Lea/rue
pledges itself to the support of the bonds, and
its members to work for their success.

Wheeler argued the law of the case
at length and. cited many authorities.
McEnerney will continue tha argu
ment Friday morning.
The first volley from the legal bat
tery trained against the charity trust
created by the will- of the late Adolph
Sutro was heard yesterday in Judge
Coffey's department of the Superior
Court. Attorney Charles S. Wheeler de
voted the entire afternoon to argument
in behalf of the contention of the Sutro
heirs (excepting Dr. Emma Merritt)
that the trust is void, their purpose be
ins to secure a partial distribution of
the $700,000 worth of property now tied
up. Dr. Merritt, who is the executrix
of her father's will, is opposing the
'other heirs. She is represented by
Bradley & McKinstry, Morrison & Cope
and R. D. Silliman. The attack upon
the will is in the hands of Bishop,
Wheeler & Hoeffler and Garret McEn
erney.
Mr. Wheeler said that the "testa
mentary scheme" contemplated by the
provision in Sutro'a - will was against
public policy and would not be sanc
tioned by right-thinking men, notwith
standing the popular encouragement of
charitable bequests. He pointed out
that Sutro had placed the San Miguel
Rancho and Sutro Heights into a trust,
directing that the two parcels, consist
ing of 1200 acres, should be conveyed
to a board of trustees composed of the
Governor of the State, Mayor of this
city and other high officials, to be held
by them until the death of the last of
his children.
Mr. Wheeler said that the 1200 acres
constituted about one-flfteenth of the
entire area of San Francisco and is
practically in the heart of what will be
a great city. Under the terms of the
will none of the land can be sold, and
not a single trust duty in relation to it
is imposed for the first ten years. AH
the rents and profits during the life
time of the survivors are to be used
for taxes and improvements of the
property and none of the Income la to
go to charity.
The will, said Mr. Wheeler, was made
in 1882, at which time the prospect of
life ahead of some of the children was
fifty or sixty years. The idea of rolling
up a great fortune for the benefit of
generations unborn, Ihe tying up of bo
large a property and the restriction of
its sale for so long a time, declared
the lawyer, were hostile to public pol
icy. If property could be tied up for fifty
years, said Mr. Wheeler, for the benefit
of charity, it could as well be tied up
or 100 or BOO years" and the vast ac
cumulation then devoted to charity, but
such a scheme would not hold in law.

During the past montn the last of a
series of patents has been granted to a
German company covering new meth
ods and machinery for the degreasing
of wool by a dry process. The degreas
ing is successfully perrormed by the
use of Infusorial earth, used as an ab
sorbent, which is applied to the wood
with great force by a current of air
by specially constructed but inexpen
sive machinery, the wool being cleaned
and degreased evenly throughout. It
has many advantages In the treatment
of skin wools â now cleaned by strong
alkalisâ as the dyes take better, which
is an important point in the manufac
ture of fine military cloth and other
fine cloths in delicate colors. â New

Evidently the v search for a national

that the discussion as to the flower
best fitted to represent the nation shall

gender bitterness and*wrath among the
partisans of the several floral aspir
ants. In the last previous debate com

Special Dispatch to The Call.
MENLO PARK. Sept. 21.â One of the
most disastrous fires that San Mateo
County has had for many years, and
one that nearly cost two well-known
members of San Francisco society their
lives, occurred here this morning when
the magnificent residence of J. J.
Moore, president of the shipping firm
of J. J. Moore & Co. of San Francisco,
was completely destroyed.
Shortly after 3 o'clock this morning
J. J. Moore, who occupied an apart
ment in the front of the house, was
suddenly aroused from a sound sleep
by a terrific crash, which it was later
learned was caused by the falling in of
the skylights on the roof of his home.
Jumping out of his bed, he was startled
by the discovery that almost the entire
portion of his home had already been
burned and that the flames were rap
idly surrounding his sleeping apart
ment.
He was not slow in realizing that his
chances of escape were quickly dimin
ishing. The ceiling of his room was
crackling with the heat and flames
were coming through the floor, beneath
which there was raging a furnace of
fire. Dragging his sleeping wife from
the bed, the husband hurriedly carried
her out into the hall and down the
stairway to the front entrance, through
which he made his escape to the lawn.
He and his badly frightened wife had
barely reached a place of safety before
the ceiling of their own room fell, and
a moment later the front portion of
their home was filled with fierce
flames.
Not an article was saved from the
home, and the only clothing that shel
tered Mr. and Mrs. Moore from the
chilly atmosphere of the early morning
were their night robes. When the re
lief party arrived- and was made to
appreciate the predicament of the
Moores the latter were hurried into
adjacent homes, where sufficient ap
parel was given them to enable them
to go to San Francisco, where they
telegraphed for apartments at the St.
Francis.
Moore estimates his loss at about
$75,000, of which $15,000 represents fur
niture, bric-a-brac and the valuable
wardrobe of his wife. > â¢
Jap Soldiers Postcard Home.
The Japanese Government has found
a novel and excellent use for post
cards. Realizing that, for various rea
sons, the soldier on campaign may not
have leisure or opportunity" to write
home to his family, the military au
thorities have supplied to each army
a sufficient number of postcards, ready
printed, to which the soldier has only
to affix his name, or more exactly, his
seal, each Japanese soldier carrying
one with him as part of his outfit.
0n all the cards the same message is
printed: '.'This is to let you know that
I am alive and well; I cannot give you
my address, not knowing where I shall
be to-morrow; but your letters will
reach me some time or other if you
reply to the place the name of which
Js printed in the postmark. Greetings
to. my family and friends." This is an
idea which might well be copied by
other nations. At once practical and
humane, it would cost little and save
many thousands of people from unnec
essary anxiety and pain. â Manchester
Guardian.
Coke Ovens In England.
The Inhabitants of the coke districts
in" the United States . will tell the
stranger that they realize as fully as
he does the shamefulness of tl..; waste
which accompanies the use of the tra
ditional type of coke oven and regret
equally the defilement of a naturally
pure atmosphere and the defacement
of a beautiful country, but they will
add that they know that experiments
have been made by the operators with
different kinds of coke ovens and that
there has not been with any type tried
sufficient success in recovery and in
the savingof by-product to make the
general introduction of new ovens com
mercially . possible. At the annual
meeting last month of the British Iron
and Steel Institute. C. Lowthian Bell
of the Clarence Works, Middlesboro,
read a paper reciting the success his
firm, has had with a German type of
coke oven â the Husseiier â which he in
troduced In 1902, and from the discus
sion which followed It seems evident
that not only has the oven he uses
given splendid results, but that there
is another type of coke oven in England
âthe Otto â giving equally successful
returns for the investment. â New York

Americans who have lived long in
Rome either reluctantly admit that
"there does seem to be something in
it," op, if they are Roman born, quietly
accept it as one of those things in
heaven and earth of which philosophy
fails to take account. In certain re
spects the Italian is markedly free
from superstition as compared with the
Celt or the Scot: for instance, the fear
of ghosts or spirits i3 so rare that I
have never met with it; on the other
hand the belief in the value of dreams
as guides to action is deep-rooted and
widespread. The dream book in some
families is held hardly second in im
portance to the book of prayer.
The Italian's eminently practical na
ture makes him utilize his dreams in
"playing the lotto," as the buying of
lottery tickets is called. To dream of
certain things indicates that one will
be lucky and should play. The choice
of the number is the chief preoccupa
tion of the hardened lottery player. It
is decided by the oddest chance â by the
number on a banknote that has been
Io3t and found again or the number of
a cab which has brought one home
from a delightful festivity.â Century.
The strangest thing about life in
Rome is that one not only does as the
Romans do, but ends by thinking as
the Romans think, feeling as the
Romans feel. The best illustration I
know of this is the mental attitude of
the foreign residents toward certain
superstitic-ns, notably the belief in the
evil eyeâ the malocchio or jettatura. as
it is Indifferently called. I never knew
an Italian who did not hold more or
less to this superstition.

The recent landing: in Brooklyn of 144
tusks of ivory from an Italian ship
is held to signify the death of
seventy-two elephantsâ at least that
number, for others, wounded, may
have crawled into the jungle and died,
out of sight of the hunters. It would
seem that the elephant is as surely
doomed as his ancestor, or cousin, the
great mammoth, was doomed by cli
matic and geologic "change, and, not
impossibly, by the persecutions of the
man of the stone age. In our country
we have seen within a few years the
practical extinction of the buffalo the
last of the Yellowstone herd was shot
a few days ago by pot hunters, who
succeeded in escaping from the park
without interference by the troopsâ
and the antelope, that used to range
the plains and foothills in thousands,
have also disappeared from most of the
Western States. As every one knows,
the game laws in thinly settled coun
tries are mere "bluff," and violation of
them is daily practiced. In civilized
New Jersey the attempt to stop the
disgusting and brutalizing slaughter of
harmless and helpless pigeons, released
from traps, has failed, because of the
pernicious activity of gun manufactur
ers and shooting clubs.â Brooklyn

Steel Ship Building In Canada.
Recent reports from the United
States Consul General at Halifax Bay
that there are four yards in Canada
for thÂ« construction of steel vessete.
One yard is building a canal boat that
is to carry 7500 bushels of wheat, or
23,000 tons of dead weight. Her cost
will be $130,000. This yard has sev
eral other contracts nearing comple
tion. The steel plates used are now
imported free of duty from the United
States, as they are not made in Can
ada. As British-built steel vessels
come into Canada duty free, it is im
possible to develop the industry in
Canada successfully, except for vessels
ol a small size or of a design necessi
tated by local requirements. It is
stated that a Nova Scotia steel com
pany intends to manufacture plates; if
so, the duty of 25 per cent will attach
and the price likely advance. This
would probably cause the suspension
of steel ship building in Canada unless
sustained by duty or bounty. â New

M. Heit, a French inventor, has de
vised a new type of compass, which is
of an automatic nature. The direction
of the compass by this arrangement is
automatically registered minute by
minute, so that by consulting the chart
the ship's officers can ascertain the
route traversed at any time during the
passage. The compass card, instead
of having at its center an agate rest
ing on fixed steel points, is fixed on a
steel pivot, which rests on a fixed
agate. The latter is immersed in a drop
of mercury, which serves to conduct
the current of electricity that makes
the registering of the movements of the
apparatus possible.
Colonel Renaud of army aeronaut
and automobile celebrity has just per
formed another- service for automobil
ism. There was recently laid before,
the French Academy of Sciences an/
ingenious contrivance invented by him
for measuring the powers of motors.
It is an apparatus which Is attached
to the axle-tree of the motor, and as
the action developed is in proportion
to the cube of the speed, it is enough
to register the number of revolutions
in order to determine the speed and
consequently the corresponding power.
Self-registering tablets are provided
to obviate all necessity for making cal
culations. The apparatus is capable of
registering up to 150 horse-power.âEx

"We speak about a person's being as
old as Methuselah. Yet the poor boy
lived but a brief hour compared with
some of the great sequoia trees which
are- being sacrificed to short-sighted
greed in California.
A late prostrate monarch of the
woods that was fifteen feet in diameter
several feet from the ground, began its
existence in 271 B. C. By 254 A. L>.,
when It was 516 years of age, a forest
fire burned on its trunk a scar three
feet in width. Then it enjoyed 1196
years of placid life.
But in 1441 A. D. the tree, then aged
1712, was injured in another fire and It
took the scar fifty-six years to heal.
The worst attack of all occurred in
1797, when the tree, then 2068 years old,
was attacked .by a fire which left a scar
which it took 103 years to heal.
Who would have thought that such
a witness to ages of change, after hav
ing stood for aver twenty centuries,
must have to be brought to earth by
the unfeeling woodman's ax some three
years ago, a victim to the mere love of
money?
But if there is no romance in a
Western wopdehopper there ought to
be some sense in Congress. Only ten
of the great isolated groves remain.
When these lone landmarks are gone
what monarch shall then ask that its
life be spared on the plea that it has
reigned supreme for thirty centuries?

Old When Christian

lrcaks of Lightning Stroke.
During an electric storm in a North
Carolina town recently, the dwelling of
George Smith was struck and his fam
ily quite severely shocked. The top of
the chimney was struck by the bolt,
making a considerable crevice in the
brif k. The lightning traversed the side
Â«'f the chimney, going into the living
room and Mrs. Smith and her eighteen
year-old son were shaken up, the for
mer rendered entirely unconscious by
the phock. A dog sleeping near the
fireplace was killed, the lamp was ex
ploded, a watch was demolished and
the clock on the mantel had all of its
framing knocked from it except the
back and it was picked up in the
middle of the floor. Strange to say,
however, the machinery of the clock
was unimpaired and it was in running
condition next morning. â New York

interest of a specially privileged and steadily
narrowing few. And I wish to return to Con

On my return to San Francisco, and wtthout
anything In the nature of solicitation on ray
part, the Democratic party again conferred
upon me the honor of a nomination for Con
gress. And now, likewise without solicitation,
the Union Labor party has for the second time
made me its nominee. I need scarcely Â»ay
that these manifestations of an unaltered
friendliness by the parties originally sup
porting me I fully appreciate.
Messrs. .'Thomas Kazan and E. J. Beaver,
Notification Committee Union Labor Party â
My Dear Sirs: I accept the nomination of
thÂ» Union Labor party to be Its candidate for
Member of the House of Representatives,
Fourth Congressional District of California.
Two years ago I consented to be the can
didate of the Union Labor party and the Demo
cratic party for a seat in thÂ« House of Rep
resentatives. I consented because I thought
I could more effectively champion certain prin
ciples of national government in which I be
lieved if I were a member of Congress than
if I wero not. I frankly explained to the
citizens of thÂ« Fourth California District what
I would stand for if sent to Washington, and
they expressed approval of my principles by
giving me a mandate to represent them In thÂ«
chief leglsaltlve body of our country.
Since then I have striven to keep thÂ» faith
I pledged my people by standing for ouch
Kovernrcent as within my Information and by
my conscience I have felt would bÂ« most likely
to yield the greatest good to the greatest
number.
Delegates to the Fourth Congression
al District Republican Convention will
assemble at Pioneer Hall this evening
to nominate a candidate for Congress.
This district lies 'wholly within . the
boundaries of San Francisco and em
braces the following assembly dis
tricts: Twenty-eighth, Twenty-ninth,
Thirtieth, Thirty-first, Fortieth, Forty
first, Forty-second, Forty-third, Forty
fourth and Forty-fifth. The Republi
cans are confident of their ability fo
elect the nominee of their convention.
The nomination of E. J. Livernash by
the Democratic convention, which met
in Santa Cruz last month, did not rep
resent the desires of a majority of ths
Democratic voters of the district. In
fact, very little interest was manifest
ed in the proceedings of the conven
tion. The Union Labor indorsement,
which was given to Mr. Livernash's
candidacy at Pioneer Hall last Tuesday
night was obtained through the agency
of William Randolph Hearst, Mayor
Schmitz, A. Ruef and other slate work-,
ers of the labor convention simply pre
sented the Livernash programme and
the delegates took it in a perfunctory
manner. In a letter as follows, Mr.
Livernash accepts the nomination of
the Labor convention.

District Will Meet This
Evening at Pioneer Hall
T. Kakamuro, a gay Japanese round
er, obtained a warrant for the arrest
of Ng Fook, a Chinese gambler, on a
charge of grand larceny. The Jap
says that while he was playing poker
at 116 Waverley place tne Chinaman
absent-mindedly went south with $20
belonging to him. A warrant was also
issued for George Mulloy, the negro
who is already charged with battery.
This time the negro is accused of crim
inal assault. Maggie O'Brien, a 16
year-old girl, is the complaining wit
ness. Steve Fallon, the opium fiend
who stole a shoe dealer's exhibit, was
given six months. Fred Williams, rep
resenting the "Louisiana Lottery Com
pany," was fined $100 for having lot
tery tickets in his possession.
The greediness of Harry Cooper and
James Joseph, two youthful burglars,
caused their capture with stolen goods
in their possession. They started to
clean out the grocery of Henry
Bull winkle at Eddy and Polk streets
yesterday morning. They were too
thorough and systematic about it.
They made two trips into the place
and annexed 2U0 packages of cigars,
tobacco and mixed groceries. They
came back a third time, probably to
take away the counters and remove the
wall paper. Policemen Plume and
Cracke were waiting for them. They
were charged before Judge Mogan. The
pair will be tried September 26.
Con Walsh, who has been on a
speech-making jag for fifteen years,
tried to orate in Judge Mogan's court.
A three months' sentence to the County
did not please him and if the police
man had not clapped his hand over
Con's mouth as soon as the sentence
was passed the bibulous orator might
have made Patrick Henry's "Give me
liberty" sound like a parlor talk.
As it was Con did some sign lan
guage with his arms. A translation oÂ£
this silent flood of rhetoric would be
unfit for publication.
Con has been as familiar a figure
along the streets as the garbage cans.
He uses them for rostrums. Mounted
on one of these, he leads off with a
bit of Daniel Webster, switches to Hen
ry Clay and finishes with Billingsgate,
etc.
Judge Mogan issued a warrant yes
terday for her arrest on a charge of
having disturbed the peace and ruined
the wash of Mrs. Lizzie Gorham of
432 1 /" Sixth street. According to the
complaint the spotless wardrobe of
Corham, as it fluttered in the back yard

Of course Raymond had the advant
age in that sort of a game. He went
at It with a will. All sorts of weird
notices appeared on the fence. They
were all meant for Coryell. He became
tired of the fenceboard repartee and
swore out the warrant.
On the fence at TS2 Valencia street
Edward L. Coryell, real estate dealer,
and C. J. Raymond have been waging
war. Though they live in adjoining
fiats they are on as pleasant terms as
Kuroki and Kuropatkin.
So intense is the neighborly feeling
that exists between them that they
hurry home to look savagely at each
other across the fence. Coryell swore
to a warrant yesterday charging Ray
mond with disturbing his peace and
exposing him to the ridicule of the
neighborhood.
Coryell placed the notice "Furnished
Room to Let" on the fence. Then it
alleges that Raymond placed beside It
a sign reading, "Wantedâ A man with
brains to make a success of renting
furnished rooms."
"I'm Chulius, Chudge. What will I
do about my gustomers?" pleaded
Davis.
"Let the customers go bananaless,
Barney Bernard," said the Judge.
"Take him away. Nobody can job this
Court."
"My gustomersâ I'm Chuliusâ I don't
know this Barney," shouted Davis as
he was hustled out.
"This thing has gone far enough,"
thundered the Judge. "You're up
against it, Barney. Guilty, and you'll
be sentenced to-morrow."
"You and your customers! You
can't fool me, Barney Bernard," said
the Judge sternly. "You bad a bet with
some one that you could job me."
"My/liame is Chulius. I lose my gus
tomerfe," replied the bewildered Davis.
"Let's see, Barney, I meaJi Julius,
you're charged with obstructing the
sidewalks at Dupont and Geary "
"The gustoraers, Chudge. If I move
on I lose the gustomers." And the ex
cited peddler did a windmill stunt with
his arms that would have set the
Fischer gallery into a gigglefest.
Judge iiojan noted the familiar ges
tures. "Barney Bernard, I'm on to you.
You can't deceive me."
"But my name is Chulius," wailed
Davis. "I don't know this Barney
Bernard. What does he peddle? Let
me go, Chudge; I'm iosing my gus
tomers."
"I'm not Barney, I'm Chulius the
banana man," said Davis. "I'm losing
Customers all the time now. Chudge,
won't you please let me 50?"
"Why, hello Barney," exclaimed
Judge Mogan yesterday when Julius
Davis stepped before him. "How are
Kolb and Dill and the rest of the
bunch?"

IX his recent report to the Governor upon the condition of the
various educational institutions supported by the State, Super
intendent of Public Instruction Kirk calls attention to the de
plorable state of the quarters occupied by the San Francisco Normal
School. Declaring it to be a disgrace that an institution, recognized
and supported by the State of California, should occupy the tumble
down rookeries which now constitute its only housing. Superin
tendent Kirk voices a strong recommendation that the next Legis
lature appropriate funds for the erection of a building suitable to
the needs and importance of the San Francisco teachers' school.
The Superintendents appeal to the Legislature merits the heart
iest indorsement. Certain it is that a dilapidated old structure which
was once a church, then after a lapse of years a high school, is not
an object of local pride when now it is tottering over the heads of
normal school scholars. To this hoary pile there come five days
out of the week teachers, students and training classes of children,
risking at least their health if not safety of limb within its shadowed
walls. With our normal schools at San Jose, at Chico and Los An
geles comfortably even elegantly housed, there is no reason why
the San Francisco institution should continue to carry on its work
in buildings condemned these many years.

crazy about them and tried to walk
Just as snaky as they looked," urged
a woman with a mind open to convic
tion. "I'm going to study snakes and

Mrs. Barstow* seeks to place dress
making on a lofty plane. She urged
the dressmakers to study history and
get back to first principles, to become
ardent students of nature and to cul
tivate their analytical powers.'
"If dressmakers would only anal
yze the gowns they make they would
get far better results," i she affirmed.
"If you get one beautiful object it will
form the motif for an entire sown. I
saw a Parisian dress not long ago and
the minute I laid eyes on it I knew

First â The Sather tract contained only 2S0 acres, and not 600.
It was sold as an ordinary commercial transaction, before the park
project was mooted for $285,000, in excess of $1000 per acre.
Second â On the Sather tract are two high ridges, running toward
the summit of the Contra Costa Mountains. The loftier one is the
north wall of Trestle Glen. Between this and the other and lower
ridge is a valley unwooded, as are both ridges. The higher ridge is
included in the park. From it Oakland is overlooked, as are the
bay, its islands and San Francisco. This high land is wide on top,
leaving ample room for roads, bridle paths and walks, for the en
joyment of the grand view which it commands. It entirely fulfills
the purpose of a birdscye view of splendid extent and variety, inspir
ing and beautiful.
Third â Trestle Glen, and its high south wall, lying southerly
from the above high ground, are included in the park. The south
wall of the glen is the part declared by the Examiner to have been
added to eke out the acreage with worthless land, to enable the
Syndicate to reserve the best land on the north side for speculative
purposes. The fact is that the park would have been defective with
out this addition. The slope of this south wall of the glen is beau
tifully wooded with thrifty live oaks, the bay tree and other interest
ing and desirable flora.
The glen itself is delightfully wooded, in great variety, including
cypress, live oak and' bay. Instead of being revolting, it has long
been a favorite resort of the people of Oakland who love nature a; 1
admire sylvan beauty. The eye that can see in it a revolting feature
is jaundiced and strabismatic. Through the glen runs a clear stream,
affluent most of the year, and with an extensive watershed, which
will permit the si 1 ring of all the water needed for the irrigation and
rkveiopm-n! ol the park, and also to keep the stream running ail the
time. The whole tract, high land and glen, is an ideal park site.
Los Angeles or any other live city would regard it a prize at the
price, and world make it so attractive that every front foot of
property in the city below would feel the thrill in an advance in
its value.
It is true that Assessor Dalton supports the Examiner in stat
ing that this tract is worth only from 75 cents to a few dollars per
acre. But he has assessed it at several hundred dollars per acre and
the record shows that part of it had a value of $1000 per acre thirty
years ago! The people of Oakland may think that it is a good ad
vertisement for their city for the Assessor and the Examiner to pro
claim that such a tract, alqngside their city and overlooking its
towers and streets, is worth only from 75 cents to less than $10 per
acre. It may be that a policy of depreciation suits them, but we
cannot believe it until by their vote they so declare. Of course
among them there is a diversity of opinion about issuing bonds to
acquire parks and improve the natural advantages of their city, but it
will be appalling if any man's vote is influenced by "the vicious tissue
of misrepresentation by which the Examiner seeks to defeat the
progress of the city.
After a patient and thorough examination, upon which we base
our foregoing flat contradiction of the Examiner, we declare that
there is not a park expert or landscape engineer in the country but
will siiirm that the tract is an ideal park site, and by its variety
of topography offers itself to the landscape gardener's art with pe
culiar adaptability. The people should visit it, note its boundaries,
and believe their own eyes rather than the malicious falsehoods of a
newspaper that cares nothing for them nor their progress, but only
for a sensation that permits appeals to prejudice and the use of
personal defamation.
THE bcrci issue to be voted on in Oakland on the 27th inst. is
lie ihird attempt made by that city to take advantage of its
nattirsl sliuitiort, scenery and clemency of climate, by beginning
a system 01 -land and water 'parks, capable of being made the finest
in the world. This system is so associated as to lie athwart the city
like a belt, running from the bay shore to the foothills of the Contra
Costa iVlotmtain.s. . .
Tiie largest tract to be acquired by this bond issue is in the
foothillv, to. be connected by a boulevard with Lake Merritt, the
water park. The tract, for present convenience, is called Central Park,
and includes all of Trestle (lien and high land on each side thereof.
The cilv has made no contract and is under no bond nor engagement
to purchase that tract, nor to pay any price therefor. Under the law
a specified tract must be stated* and" a maximum price fixed. This
was done by an open understanding with the Realty Syndicate, the
owner of the property.
Tn the last days of the bond campaign an attack is made upon
the purchase of this Central Park tract. The Examiner has made
this attack arid has pretended to make certain statements of fact,
upon which it charges Mayor Olricy and the City Council with put
ting up a job. to The injury of the city, for the enrichment of the
Really Syndicate. These pretended statements of fact are: That
ihc Sather tract, part of which is included in the park, consisted of
<<x> acres, for which a much less price was paid than is exacted from
the cilv; that the high ground in this tract is reserved by the Syndi
cate to sell lor residences: that all high ground is excluded from the
park, from which a commanding view may be had of Oakland, the
bay and San I ; rancisco: that the 305 acres included in the park is a
rugged canyon, of revolting appearance, and totally unfit for such a
purpose: that the price is enormously in excess of the value of the
land. County Assessor Dal ton is enlisted by the Examiner on the
question of valuation, and says the land is worth only from 75 cents
to a few dollars per acre.
The Call, being desirous that the progressive people of Oakland
shall realize their aspiration for the things needful to make it a
beautiful and attractive city, has done what it could to promote the
success of the bond issue. Being still of that mind, we have had a
careful examination irfade of the proposed Central Park tract. This
examination was not casual nor cursory, but was made on foot, by
traversing the whole tract, from the creek in Trestle Glen to the
heights above it. We have also made inquiry into the record on
the subject of values, and arc now able to speak with knowledge on
the mailer, and to traverse the Examiner's statement of facts as
follows:

An answer and cross-complaint . in
the case of Letson Balliet and Flor
ence E. Balliet against the White Swan
Mines Company were filed yesterday.
The suit Is to invalidate an assess
ment of 5 cents a share. The com
pany denies that its officers and direc
tors were not legally elected and de
nies that Balliet and his wife own
216.6S0 shares of the company stock,
but aver that Balliet was an officer
and one of the organizers of the com
pany and subscribed for 275,000
shares of stock for which he has never
paid. The company denies that its
levy of an assessment of 5 cents a
share was illegal, but was for the pur
pose of paying existing debts and the
running expenses of the mine. The
company asks the court to order the
plaintiffs to deliver up the stock for
cancellation, to declare that the as

a pioneer costumer on Clay street. He
died fourteen months ago, leaving an
estate worth $250,000. He made a
few minor bequests and bequeathed
$60,000 to Annie T. Smith, who had
been reared by himself and wife. The
residue of the estate was left to the
widow. The relatives at Warsaw
were not mentioned in the will, and In
the Detition for the revocation of the
admission of the testament to pro

DESERTED WIFE DIVORCED
FROM THEATRICAL MANAGER
Charles Wyman, accused of ballot
box stuffing at the primary election
last month, was before Judge Cabaniss
yesterday for examination on the
complaint of Fairfax H. Wheelan, his
accuser. Very little was accomplished.
R. H. Countryman, attorney for the
defendant, opened the day by inter
posing a demurrer to the complaint j
on the ground that the primary elec- j
tion law had been declared unconsti- j
tutional by the Supreme Court and ,
that the arrest was therefore illegal.
John A- Hosmer, representing the j
State as special prosecutor, read a
long list of authorities in contradic
tion of this claim. Judge Cabaniss
took the matter under advisement
and ordered the case to proceed.
G. P. Adams, Registrar of Voters
and secretary of the Board of Elec
tion Commissioners, was the only wit
ness called. He came armed with a
pile of his office books and documents
in reference to the election in ques
tion. The principal document needed,
the proclamation of the election, upon
which Attorney Hosmer had intended
to force the issue of the case, was not
there. In its place Adams had brought
a copy of that document. Attorney
Countryman objected to the copy be
ing introduced in evidence and after j
a long discussion between the con
tending forces, in which Attorney j
Countryman won his fight. Judge Ca- |
baniss brought the session to a close, j
He did this in order to give time to
have the original proclamation pro
duced. The hearing will, be resumed
to-morrow at 2:30 p. m.
of Evidence and the Case Goes
O*er Until Friday.

PfeelaJ Difpatrh to The Call
In March of the present year the di
vorce suit became public, having been
flled secretly in Big Horn County, Wyo.
The charge was that Mrs. Cody had at
tempted to poison her husband on the
night . before Christmas, 1900, and had
been guilty of numerous other acts
detrimental to his peace of mind. Mrs.
Cody and her friends were thunder
struck and attorneys were engaged to
reply to the charges with a cross-com
plaint. The reply was never drawn, al
though it was Dublicly charged that
Buffalo Bill had been much ln the com
pany of a woman who traveled along
the route taken by the Wild West
Show. Mrs. Cody obtained a change of
venue to Sheridan. Wyo., out of "Buf
falo Bill's" home county.
DENVER. Sept. 21.â Convinced that
he was deceived into bringing false at
tempted poisoning charges against his
wife. Colonel William F. Cody will
withdraw his suit for divorce in Sheri
dan, "vifyo., this week. He has already
written to Mrs. Louisa Cody at North
Platte, Neb., admitting to. the woman,
to whom he has not spoken a word
in eighteen years, that he was misled
and is desirous of .obtaining her forgive
ness, their .relations to continue as In
the past. This result, according to word
received here by relatives of the scout,
is due to the arguments of Buffalo
Bill's own attorneys â¢ and public senti
ment.
Special Dispatch to The Call,
ST. LOUIS, Sept. 21.â The most im
portant subject presented to the mem
bers of the International Geographical
Congress, which convened to-day at
the exposition, was the proposed trans-
Alaska-Siberian Railroad, which is of a
wider scope than any undertaking oÂ£
Its ki'id in the history of engineering.
Belolrel, a member of the Geographical
Society of Paris and the projector . of
the railway, reviewed the history of the
undertaking.
After a conference with President
Roosevelt and Secretary Hitchcock on
October 11 relative to securing the neu
tralization of the Behring Strait, De
lobel will sail for France and spend the
coming winter endeavoring to effect
final arrangements for projecting the
line through Russia.
The approbation of the Czar of Rus
sia, President Roosevelt and several
European sovereigns relative to the
trans-Alaska-Siberian Railway has
been obtained and the trans-Alaska-
Siberian-French syndicate, of which
Delohel is president, considers that,
when the arrangements with Russia
have ben made, the final step will have
been taken and the success of the un
dertaking assured.
The Pacific Packing and Navigation

The house. is an eighteen-room dwell
ing at 2214 Union street, big enough
to accommodate twenty men with all
sorts of luxuries. The squad to fill
these rooms will be chosen by the
coaches and Captain Stroud.
BERKELEY, Sept. 21. â The Uni
versity of California is well off In
coaches this year, having four at work.
Hopper, Greisberg and Mini have been
retained to coach the varsity and sec
ond elevens and last night the execu
tive committee of the Associated Stu
dents engaged Lee Kerfoot '01 to put
the freshmen team into fighting shape.
Kerfoot was a close rival of "Jimmy"
Hopper for Quarterback of the famous
'99 team and knows the game. Since
leaving college he has coached a num
ber of "prep" school elevens, so he has
kept in touch with the way the game
is played now. His sole attention will
be devoted to the freshmen eleven,
while Hopper and Greisberg will look
after the varsity and Mini after the
second eleven. 1
KERFOOT ENGAGED TO COACH
THE BERKELEY FRESHMEN
Will Devote His Entire Attention to
the Team Throughout the
Season.
Despite the fact that it lost a hard
fought game, the play was so funny
that Manager Dugdale shook with
laughter. Thlelman pitched splendid
ly for Portland and the work behind
him was good. Seattle took Shields
out in the third inning. Charlie Hall
pitched out the game in fine form. The
score:

STANFORD FRESHMEX TO PLAY.
Will 3Icct the Strong Eleven From
Snnta Clara College.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. Sept.
21. â The Stanford freahman football
team will line up to-morrow afternoon
against the strong eleven from Santa
Clara College. This will be the sec
ond game of the season for the young
sters, they having defeated Palo Alto
High School last week by the score
of Â£ to 0.
The freshmen have been drilled dil
igently all week by Coach Hauver
man. but no team ha3 been selected
as yet. Every player in the squad
will be given an opportunity to show
what he can do In the game to-mor
row. :One noticeable change is the
removal of Pemberton, the Mission
High player, from the guard to full
back, his old position, and the placing
of Moody, a Belmont player, in the
former position. Horton, from Ukiah.
has been doing unusually well at
tackle this week, as has Coe at cen
ter. The line-up of the two teams
will be:
Stanford freshmenâ CoÂ« center: Gay. right
guard; Moody, left guard; Bryan, right tackle-
Horton. left tackle; AVllson. right end- Over
man, left end; Kearae. quarterback; Cadwal
lader, right halfback; Kocher left halfback'

John CMera Found Dead.
John O'Mera or Oileara, a man
about 35 years old. supposed to" bÂ«
from the country, was suffocated by
Inhaling Illuminating: gas in the In
ternational Hotel last Tuesday night.
O'Mera arrived at the hotel on Tues
day. He went to bed on Tuesday
night very drunk and was found dead!
at 9:20 a. m yesterday, the valve of
the gas burner being open. Four
empty beer bottles and three flasks
which had contained whisky trer*
found in the room. Ten dollars and
fifty cents and a Southern Pacific
conductor's receipt for It fare wer*
among his effects. His clothing was
new and had been made in Sacra
mento. Indications are that death was
the result of an accident.
Al Hereford, Joe Gars' manager,
reached here last night from Balti
more. His first act was to post $1000
in caÂ«h as a forfeit to bind a match
with Jimmy Britt at 133 pounds for
tlie lightweight championship of tne
world. _ . ,
Hereford stipulates that Gans Is to
â¢meet Walcott. and Britt is to meet
Young Corbett. as already planned,
and that the outcome of these
matches is not to have any bearing
on th- fight for the lightweight cham
pionship between Britt and Gans,
Hereford says the match must be
made, if at all. before Gans and Wal
t ott fight a week from to-morrow
night.
The Britt -Corbett fight seems in the
air. The Californian has been trying
his best to pet into telegraphic com
munication with Corbett. but the lat
ter has proved elusive. Harry Pol
lok no longer represents Corbett, so
there is no one here authorized to
speak for the erratic little Denverite.
PoMok will witness the McCoy-Sul
livan fight in Los Anseles and the
Gans-Walcott fight here and will then
return East. He is to take big Jim
Kennedy's j>lace in the former pro
moting firm of Kennedy & Powers.
Billy Roach received a telegram
from Young Corbett late last night,
in which he says he wired Britt here
.ind received an answer that Britt waft
in the country. Roach has placed the
boxers in communication and some
thing definite is expected to result to
day.
With Britt at 1Â»3 Pounds.
AI Hereford Posts $1000 for a Match
CANS' FORFEIT IS UP.
Nor did the run-getting end there.
Dunleavy walloced a slow one in the
fourth, and it never stopped till it
reached Ringgold street and landed In
the gutter. The only Angel run was
the result of a double by Cravat h in
the second, followed by Chase's sacri
fice and Toman's drive to the left
garden.
Moskiman handled his nine chances
in great shape. He was full of life
and action and never played, better
ball. Not an error marred the ' play
on either side. A one-handed pick
up by Chase at second brought down
the stand and bleachers. The score:

Umpireâ McDonald.
Peter Lohman gathered a motley
throng of baseball players yesterday
and took a lasfchance by turning
them loose against the Angels. All
the fans were surprised when they
saw MoFkiman at third. Stark in Ju
lie istreib's clothes and Graham mak
ing high signs from far-away left
field. But the Angels did not do any
laughing. Far from It. They took
second money. Score, 4 to 1.
It can be justly said that Oakland
never played a better game. Xo one
erred and hard chances were eaten
like luncheon. Moskiman* played
third base as well as Jimmy Collins
ever did in his life, and the way Dun
leavy stowed away the torrid ones
around short made eome of the fans
forget Buck Francks ever drew a
salary from Cal Ewing.
Then, to make everything' right,
Schmidt pitched real big league ball.
Except for one run In the second in
ning, the Angels never could get
Jerry to the ones he was unloading.
To help out In the tight places four
swell double plays were made to the
bewilderment of the southern con
tingent.
Baum was hit hard, but at that
Oakland was Just a little bit lucky.
After two had been dead in the sec
ond spasm, Graham swung on one and
sent It slowly creeping to Brashear.
Baum tarried a trifle too long before
covering the sack and the man was
safe. Stark lifted one over Flood's
head and Byrnes swung through to
center field, bringing Graham safely
over the final jump.
Both runners were advanced a bag
and Schmidt chopped one. to Flood.
Timothy was waiting for the sphere
and was getting ready to wing It over
to Brashear when it developed a ping
pong twist, bounded over his head and
out to left field, and both men
sneaked In.

The freshmen weakness was dus
mostly to the absence of Sparry, who

better with their superior weight and

INHERITS
When a child I had a very severe at-
tack of Diphtheria, which came near prov-
ing fatal. Upon recovery the glands of the
neck were very much enlarged, and after
the free use of iodine, the right one was
reduced to its normal size, but the left
one continued to grow â very slowly at
first, until it was about the size of a goose
cjrg, which began to press on the wind-
pipe, causing dtfficnlt breathing, and be-
came very painful. Anindsion was made
and a large quantity of pus discharged.
The gland was removed, or as much as
could with safety be taken out. For ten
years I wore a little piece of cloth about an
inch long in my neck to keep the place
open. During this time I had to have it
cut open by the doctor every time I took
cold or the opening clogged. In the Spring
or early Summer of 1SS4 I was persuaded
by my wife to use S. S. S., which I did,
strictly in accordance with directions. I
took twenty-six large bottles, and was en-
tirely cured, for I have not suffered since
that time. B. S. Racz,and.

Fouk has disappeared from Forest
ville. and foul play is suspected. The
man has not been seen since Sunday,
at which time he was exhibiting
money. He had more than a hun
dred dollars in cash, and it is believed
he has been murdered for this sum.
Fouk was not known to have any bad
habits, and the fact that thirty dol
lars was due him the day after hia
disappearance lends color to the
theory of foul play.

TUGS DAUNTLESS AND DEFIANCE TOWING THE WATER-LOGGED LUMBER STEAMER NORTHLAND FROM MONTEREY
BAY, WHERE SHE "WENT ON TIID ROCKS EARLY MONDAY MORNING AND FILLED, AND WAS ONLY PREVENTED
FROM SINKING BY THE BUOYANCY OF HER CARGO.
FRESNO, Sept. 21. â Because R. I*
Stout Is short about J400 In his ac
counts he is lodged in the county Jail.
He must face a charge of embezzle
ment brought by Moore & Cate, the
real estate firm for which he -worked.
Stout collected many outstanding
bills, It is said, and failed to turn the
money over to his employers. He
was caught, it is alleged, while trying
the Combination of the big safe. Hia
actions aroused his employers' suspi
cion and a later Investigation revealed
the shortage. .
Stout's relatives tried to settle the
matter, but this is the second time the
firm has been duped by a collector
and they determined to prosecute the
young man. He was married only a
few months ago. His young wife was
prostrated by the arrest. Her friends
have been closely watching her, as
she has threatened to commit .sui
cide.
Well Connected Youth Is Arrested on
Embezzlement Charge Preferred
by His Employers.

REDDING, Sept. 21.â Miss Hazel Hol
lingsworth, 18 years of age and ill with
diphtheria was started back for her
home at Copper City, a distance of
twenty-three miles, through rain this
afternoon because there was no place In
Redding where she could be cared for.
Miss Holllngsworth, who had been
employed at a dwelling a few miles
this side of Copper City, became ill
there. Her employer brought her to
Redding this afternoon to have her
case diagnosed and attended to. The
local physician to whom she was taken
promptly pronounced her Illness diph
theria and administered anti-toxin. A
place where she could be cared for here
was then sought, but without success.
She had no claim on any one In Red
ding and no one wanted to take a con
tagious case.
Admission to the County Hospital
here was sought, but it was denied on
a technicality and the sick girl was
compelled to take the long ride through
the rain to her home, twenty-three
miles away.
Eefuge Refused at County
Hospital at Kedding and
by Residents of the Town
Tuesday about 1 p. m. the tug Daunt
less arrived from San Francisco and
hooked on to the disabled and unwieldy
\essel. Her stern was so low in the
water that the steering gear was use
less and the yawing of the steamer
from tide to side jerked the strong tug
out of her course. Captain Shea tele
graphed to this city for assistance. The
Defiance, Ca&tain James, was dis
patched south and met the tow four
l^en miles north of Monterey Bay
about 4 o'clock yesterday afternoon.
The two tugs pulling side by side
brought the waterlogged craft Into port.
It was a hard tow, and the course of
the trio on a chart would make a beau
tiful zigzag line. Often the Dauntless
and Defiance would be steering four
points off the course when the tow
would drag unusually hard on the lines,
jerking the tugs' heads around.
The Northland, which is now at Lom
bard street wharf, will be taken to the
dry dock, unloaded and repaired. E.
J. Dodge & Co., the owners of the ves
sel, do not expect that the cost of re
pairs will exceed the insurance on the
steamer.
Swinging wildly from starboard to
port and almost unmanageable, the dis
abled steamer Northland was dragged
from Monterey Bay into this harbor
last night by the Spreckels tugs
Dauntless and Defiance. There are
twenty-five feet of water slopping
around in her hold, but much of her
ICO,OIK> feet of lumber cargo is down
there also, and with all that buoyancy
the eteamer with the water surging
through her could not Bink. She
dropped down till her main deck aft
was even with the waves and there
Khe hung. The deck load of lumber is
chained to the hull and cannot float
away, consequently the Northland
could drift on the surface of the ocean
for years.
The steamer was on her maiden voy
age, bound from this port for San Pe
dro and had put into Monterey Bay to
land about 200.000 feet of lumber, when
ehe struck a rock off Point Pinos at 2
o'clock Monday morning. Captain
Bonifield succeeded in getting her into
<l ee p vater, but the ship's bottom was
shattered and she filled to the deck.

Wheat and Other Grains.
WHEAT â Foreign futures were higher.
Chicago was weaker on the day. The wires
or E. F. Hutton & Co. said:
"There was quite heavy liquidation early In
the day, but the market took It so well that
the pit concluded Armour must be buying
through brokers. This was a guess. There
was some buying on strength in Paris and the
reduced estimate by the French Millers' Asso
ciation on the French crop. . Inasmuch as
Wheat Is worth something less than 90c per
bushel to ship to Paris, tho wisdom of this Is
hardly apparent. There were again large re
ceipts at primary markets and a good milling
demand for good Wheat.' The off grades were
not in good demand. There Is etlll plenty of
bullish sentiment, but It has not the force
that it had a week or ten days ago. Traders ara
more disposed to scalping operations and to
watch movement and demand."
In this market futures were strong, with a
good buying demand early, but the appear
ance of selling orders depressed prices later
on. Trading was active. The cash grain was
firm, and sellers tried to get an advance, but
did not succeed.

i Hay and Feedstuff s.
\-_' ~~ ~~ ~~ . c Â¦Â¦-. ":
i Everything under this head remains about
ss previously quoted. The circular of Somers
i & Co. says of Hay:
'Exceedingly light arrivals of hay have been
noted for tho past ten days previous to yes
' tcrday. at which time the hay blockade was
broken, and cars which had been standing on
: the country sidetracks for from one to three
weeks were started on their way to market,
158 of them having arrived thus far. It is
reported that there are still from 400 to 500
cars yet remaining that should have been mar
keted here long since. In eplte of the fact
that we have been receiving such light ship
ments there has been no very great improve
ment in the situation here, for the fact that
large quantities of hay wept on their way to
market was universally known. The market
has naturally been a bit hungry for hay. .but
by the time the, remaining cars are landed
bere everybody will be overcrowded again.
'Local trade continues unchanged, -with a
still marked decrease In the demand from that
of last season or the year preceding. In all
3300 tons have arrived during the week and
practically all of this has gone for town con
sumption the export demand being very light.
Rumors of large Oriental orders reach us from
time to time, but thus far nothing has come
of them. -
"The greater bulk of the hay now arrivln?
Is of rather cheap quality. Choice wheat hay,
which is a bit scarce this season. Is being
greatly sought for, while the other grades
seem to be dragging. Straw has been crowded
off the market by a great amount of cheap
hay. and tame oat hay, which seems to be In
such abundance this season, is also meeting
with some disfavor. Occasional shipments of
fancy wheat hay sell above quotations, but
other grades continue about as before."

CHICAGO, Sept. 21.â Easy cables, with
weather favorble for the maturing- of the corn
crop, had a weakening influence on wheat at
the opening. The selling was 1 quite general in
character, a lot of long wheat coming out as
soon as trading began. Initial quotations on
December were off %c to %c at Jl 08% to
*1 08%. May was down %@%c to %c at
$1 10% to $1 11. The market secured little
support, during the first hour, and In conse
quence prices declined still further, December
falling off to $1 08% and May to $1 10%. Sen
timent temporarily turned bullish liter In the
day under the influence of a cable dispatch
from Paris giving a private estimate of the
French crop. According to the authority quot
ed, the total yield will show a decrease of
(31,000,000 bushels, according to the official
figures. About this time the Paris market
showed an advance equal to l%c to 2%c- a
bushel. The strong front presented by the
market here was made more pronounced by
advices from St. Louis, where an Improved
demand for flour had developed. The cash
situation also at St. Louis was a source of
comfort to the bull element here, prices being
up from lc to 2c. One of the most prominent
operators In tiie pit was credited with heavy
jiurrlia:< *, and this in itself had much to do
with the advance. On the bulge 'December
sold up to $1 10 and May to $1 11%. Late In
the day, however, the gain was all lost, llb
Â«r.il profit- taking again forcing prices down
almost to the lowest point of the session. The
market closed weak, with December at |1 Oil.
May closed at $110%. Clearances ' of wheat
and flour were equal to 22.600 bushels.
Reports of comparatively small damage to
the crop by frost during the previous night
and liberal primary receipts caused weakness
in corn. Tho market closed weak and near
the lowest point of the day. December opened
'A@%c to t Â»iS J }4c lower at 50%c to 50%c. sold
between SOftc and 51c and closed at 50%@
00*,c. ,
Weakness In other grains had a depressing
effect en the oat market. The market closed
at the low point. After oper.lng %@Vic-lowor
at 32%c to 82%c, December ranged between
31T4c and 32Vi4*32%c, closing at 3l%c.
Sympathy with the weakness In grain mar
kets caused a lower market -for provisions.
At the clorc January IÂ»rk wuftiown 17%c at
$13 10, lard wax off 5@7%c at- $7 30. and ribs
cloted at $0*0^0 S2%, a loss of 7%c.

As already mentioned, the demand for the
upper grades of Butter and Eggs is losing
it.s snap, as prices have got to that point
where buyers bike only enough to satisfy
their momentary requirements. Hence deal
ers are reporting quieter markets for both de
scriptions. The advance In Butter nas 1Â«J
to offerings from outside points, and some
shipments from Utah are already on the mar
ket at. 26c per lb. and the trade are beginning
to fear that a further advance will call In
supplies from still other distant Kources. Still
the market rules firm and top quotations are
obtained without difficulty.
Occasional sales of Egsrs In a small way at
40c are reported, but they are not yet suffi
ciently numerous to warrant this figure as a
quotation. Fine ranch are etlll closely cleaned

Cheese shows no further change, most deal

: decidedly safer and ofTored na encourasempnt
to the bears to extend their operations. The
I <arly uncertainty cf the market gave way to
j Im TflT<1 r'.:!.i.'. .-M- and a general upward ten
deacjr. The rise In Union Pacific was attrlb
utc-4 to a Â«Jen:ar.d from thorts, but the move
ment was surrounded- with more or less mys
tery and was the rubject of many rumcrs.
Sorne Â«>f these had to do with supposed com
petitive, buying looking to the strengthening of
control on account of aHefred divergence of
vkv/s among powerful capitalists heretofore in
accord In the railroad world. The recent ad
miFcior. to th3 board of directors of the West
era Pacific, now under construction, of E. S.
liawlejr and cf a representative of the Gould
lntiÂ»r?Â»it was advanced as the. supposed cause
of the differences. But the strength of Union
Pacific caused an Improvement In the general
list by eyn:paU:y, a result hardly to be ex
pected from a contest for control In the open

THE OUTLOOK.
"Durir? the pÂ»Fi week or ten days Uie mar
kct retuiijÂ«-d much of its former activity,
tranfactitns running Into the neighborhood of
a i::i;;:on thares a day. This activity could
fcardly b* attributed to outside buying, for.
â¢v . ..â¢ Uie itililic has beeu operating with
rather more 'rtrdom than of lÂ«.te. the bulk
Â«Â¦: t.uyJnx and selling Â«u for professional ac
count, and unquestionably has strong bankicg
eurport. The market is consequently still in
C' n:petent hands and contraolled by the big
lÂ«iders. who liave plenty of stocks to eell and
would probably like to put themselves in good
srane to handle tome of the important new
iwuct. which are known to be in contempla
tioii and uhlch have br-en held In abeyance
finer the setback of 19tt'J. If the investment
demand provfs eufficient to relieve the market
cf Its present surplus of securilies all will
to well and tie upward movement may con
tir.ue. For on<*e Â«lf-irtereat has brought all
th*r market leaders into harmony: and. as
tliÂ»-rÂ»- are co oisturbir.g deals on hand to
threaten the entente, the prospect is fair for
their huldinjr together until the buying power
trims exhausted. At the moment the buying
tÂ«w(r is improving. Large sums have gone
Into bon<i< ar.<3 high-class investments and the
public confidence is crowinr at a va.ee which
euspests more activity In general speculation.
In Khfit, t!.e market If in excellent technical
CGr.dition, ar.d it is likely to go still higher
IMfvided the big Jnsider e hold together and
provided ther^ are no untoward disasters to
Interfere; but hereafter the fluctuations will
lie wide zvA frequent, admitting of profit
i!"- quick tuniF and tnakinr it the safer
T.-sy to operate from now onward.

tended at that time to move that the
bond be forfeited, but in view of the
fact that the bond is missing, action
will probably be postponed. Captain
Martin has not yet received a reply to
his letter to the Chief of Police of Los
Ar.ge!es asking for information as to
the reported death of Kratz by drown

Police Judge Fritz is apparently the
only person who can explain what has
become of the bond for S5000 which
be accepted on July 11. 1903. for the
release of A. A. Kratz, held that day
to answer on a charge of felony em
bezzlement. Property Clerk Dinan has
thÂ» order of release signed by Judge
Fritz after the acceptance of the
bonds. One of the surties was Mrs.

Judge Fritz is absent on his vacation

To-day. In Gotham, does Edgar D.
Peixotto claim the lovely Miss Malvina
Nathan for his bonny bride. The cere
mony will take place at the home. of
the bride's aunt. Mrs. Frederick
Nathan. 162 West Eighty-sixth street,
and will be rather in the nature of a
family affair.
It was supposed that Joseph D. Red
ding was going on to be best man, but
since the famous Bohemian doesn't
start East*, until to-day, he must needs
yield the honor to another. Mr. and
Mrs. Andrew M. Davis will represent
Mr. Peixotto** family at the wedding.
The young people. will wander about
the East a-honey mooning until Octo
ber 8, when they are due In San Fran
cisco. Here a cordial welcome will
greet the young bride, who Is, by the
way, a famous beauty, and the clever
young barrister who â¢ has won her.
A pretty bride was Miss Alma Lor
etta Mitchell, as she stood last night
in a bower of blossoms, promising her
hand and her heart to Walter Thayer
Wood the Rev. John Hemphlll blessing
the promiseâ the sweetest promise in
woman's gift.
Attending the bride as maid of honor
was Miss Alice Downing, gowned
fetchlngly In white crepe, and Miss
Elsie Cook. Miss Houston Cook and
Miss Georgie Shephard as bridesmaids,
all in frocks of pale green crepe and
bearing bouquets of maidenhair fern.
Lovely, indeed, was the bride In her
nuptial robe of cluny lace. Her veil,
enveloping her like a mist, was held
by a spray of orange blossoms, and on
her arm she bore an exquisite bouquet
of lilies of the valley. . .
The groom was attended by Duncan
Albright, and Nathaniel Gilman, Edgar
Alexander and Ralph Mitchell looked
after the seating of the guests.
Calvary was beautiful in its nuptial
setting, the palms and ferns and green
festoons creating a fine setting for the
bride and her suite.
A reception was held at the Mitchell
home after the ceremony, whereat the
same floral scheme was maintained.
The young folk will leave to-day for
the north.

FAMOUS YOUNG PIANIST WHO IS
SOON TO APPEAR IN SAN FRAN
CISCO.
Chairman Connor took occasion to
make public statement of the fact that
previous to the Knizhts Templar con
clave the Street Committee had tried
to have the regular contracting firm,
Yorke .& Co., repair the pave
ment repaired in time for the parade of
Phelan building, where members of the
Public Works Board established the
notorious signs while thousands of
strangers were in the city, charging
the Supervisors with political animus
in their denial of sufficient funds to
improve the streets.
"The contractors' reply was, 'I would
never hear the last of It if I complied
with your request,' " explained Sup
ervisor Connor. "Of course, we knew
he meant that Inasmuch as he was the
regular contractor of the Board of
Works he did not wish to do anything
that would displease it. We made every
effort to have that bit of street patched
up and the Public Works Board, which
made such a hue and cry, was really
responsible for not having the pave
ment repaired in time for the parade of
the Knights Templar."
"Well, it comes from the intelligent
Board of Fire Commissioners, and let
It go at that," remarked Connor sar
castically, and the matter was dropped.
Braunhart objected to auditing
the claim of Gray Brothers for $7 a
month rental for each of the three
street sweeping machines used by the
Public Works Department. He learned
that the machines could be purchased
new from the factory at $320.
"This rent of $7 a month on that in
vestment amounts to extortion," said
Braunhart. "The machines of Gray
Brothers are old, too. The Public
Works Board has never made requisi
tion on the Supervisors for rental of
the machines,, as required by law. I in
sist that the : city ought to purchase
machines or prevail upon Gray Broth
ers to reduce their exorbitant price."
It was decided to ask the Finance
Committee to meet with the Street
Committee at 2:30 o'clock Friday to in
vestigate thoroughly the Street Sweep
ing Department as conducted by the
Works Board.
"There Is absolutely no justification
for that complaint," declared Chair
man Connor hotly. "That is the best
pavement In San Francisco and I
never heard of a fire horse falling
there. I don't believe there is any
necessity whatever to tear up that un
usually good pavement to replace it
with basalt."
"And the Public Works Board and
the Fire Commission," added Braun
hart, "ought to know the Supervisors
can appropriate no money for this
purpose, because there is no fund
available. The complaint and petition
should have been presented before the
budget was made up. It is really a re
flection on the Board of Supervisors
to ask us to appropriate funds when
it is a well-known fact that after the
budget has been made up there are no
other funds available."
Supervisors Connor, Braunhart and
Rock, sitting as the Street Commit
tee, yesterday freely voiced their dis
approval of the Public Works Board.
Supervisor Braunhart was particularly
severe in his remarks and Connor gave
him good reinforcement.
The Works Board, it was said, con
stantly makes demands on the Super
visors for appropriations when It Is
well known to air conversant with the
municipal government that there can
be no such appropriations, no pro
vision having been made for them in
the budget. The Supervisors declared
that tho Public Works officials are
aiming at a campaign of annoyance.
A communication from the Fire
Commission that had been transmitted
by. the Board of Public Works aroused
warm discussion in the committee. The
firemen complain that the grade of
Grant avenue, between Bush and Sut
ter streets, is so steep that on foggy
or rainy days the pavement becomes
dangerous' to the department horses.
A basalt pavement fourteen feet wide
in the middle of the street is desired
to replace the asphalt, the cost teing
estimated at $1500.
Both Dr. Taylor and Dr. Kenyon
were presented with tokens of appre
ciation for the work they had done
during conclave week. Dr. Kenyon re
ceived a silver tantalus and Dr. Tay
lor a cut glass decanter and set of
glasses. The' presentation was made
by Dr. Charjes S. Field in a graceful
speech that brought cheers from the
gathering and an enthusiastic chorus
of "He's a Jolly Good Fellow."
Among those present were:
Dr. C. N Appel U. 6. A.; Dr. R. Smith.

Sir Knight S. A. Clarke, captain of
Drill Corps Company B of California
Commandery No. 1, Knights Templar,
received a surprise last night from a
merry crowd of Sir Knights and ladies.
In recognition of the active work he
had done during the conclave. Captain
Clarke was presented with a chest of
silver. The set, which was made and
engraved by the Fleissner- Marshall
Company, is a triumph of the jewelers'
art. Sir Knight M. J. Savage made the
presentation speech. Captain Clarke
was very much affected by the gift.

The Kinghts Templar of the medical
profession who served during the re
cent Triennial Conclave were guests
last evening of Dr. A. Taylor at a ban
quet given at the San Francisco Club.
The affair was especially In honor of
Dr. C. G. Kenyon.
Founder's Day was observed at the
California School cf Mechanical Arts
yesterday, when the great body of stu
dents, numbering 410. rendered good
practical account of themselves in the
presence of a large gathering of citi
zens. After all the shops and depart
ments had been visited Principal
George A. Merrill and his staff received
hearty congratulations on the admir
able showing of their clever young pu-
P Founder"F Day is very dear t0 a11
connected with the school and it was
with great interest that the instructors
and students listened to the eloquent
eulogy of the late James Lick, the
founder, delivered by United States
Senator George C. Perkins. In the
course of his remarks the Senator laid
particular emrihafis upon the import
ance of every man being a self-sup
porting, self-reliant member of the
body politic. He reminded the stu
dents of their duties as citizens to work
for good government and upon his
hearers the necessity for a more inti
mate acquaintance with the machinery
of government, whether municipal.
State or national.
Alluding to the founder's personality.
his integrity and perserverance as a
workman, the Senator told of the great
respect Mr. Lick had for the good
workman, while for the man who was
not a thoroughly practical worker, the
man who could not show practical re
sults of gocd workmanship, he had not
much regard.
Frank J. Symmes presided in the ab
sence of President Horace Davis. The
other directors present were E. B.
Pond. Charles A. Murdock and John O.
Harron.
It has been urged that all the institu
tions founded by the late James Lick
Fhould generally observe September 21.
It was in the year 1S75 that he executed
his famous deed trust setting apart a
large amount of money for his numer
ous endowments, among which are the
Lick Observatory. Academy of Sci
ences, the Lick baths and the School of
Mechanical Arts.
E. Myron Wolf, State Insurance
Commissioner, after his crusade against
companies carrying on business .illegal
ly in Los Angeles and other southern
towns, has begun operations in this
city. Yesterday he secured warrants
from Police Judge Cabaniss for the ar
rest of four insurance agents who. he
alleges, represent companies unauthor
ized to conduct business in this State.
Two of them are H. A. Marchand and
C. B. F. Lincoln, representing the In
ternational Registry Company. They
furnish customers with a key, ring and
card case containing the name and de
scription of the person insured and a
policy with the Pennsylvania Life and
Accident Association.
C. M. Oakley is another defendant.
He represents the General Accident In
surance Corporation, which. Wolf al
leges, is not authorized to carry on its
business in this State. Oakley is also
co-defendant with Charles F. Blandln,
agent of the Mutual Reserve Life In
surance Company of New York. In all
of these cases the allegation is made
that neither the companies named nor
their agents have filed in the office of
the Insurance Commissioner the neces
sary penal bond of $2000 to enable them
to do business in this State.
"Wolf says that he will also sue
through the Attorney General to en
join the Mutual Benefit Co-operative
Society â Frank E. Dayman, manager â
from doing business in this State and
to revoke the certificate of incorpora
tion. It is incorporated under the laws
of this State. Manager Dayman claims
that he is not doing an insurance busi
ness, but Wolf says he has evidence to
the contrary.
