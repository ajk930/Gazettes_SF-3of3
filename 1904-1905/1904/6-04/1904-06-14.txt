do him some personal Injury and ap
pealed to Chief Wlttman for protec

had annoyed him to such an extent
that he had been forced to leave Oak

that Goldman had once displayed a big

PREVIOUS TROUBLES.
The trouble between ex- Mayor Snow
of Oakland and Adolph Goldman first
came before the public on the night of
September. IS. 1&03. when the latter
made a vicious attack on the former
official. Â¦ The encounter took place in
front -of Snow's residence. 914 Eighth
street, Oakland, and the ex- Mayor was
j severely beaten before the two men
were separated. Goldman accusd Snow
of owing him money and refusing to
pay and the argument over the debt
had passed to. blows. Snow made a
statement to the effect . that Goldman
had hounded him ever since he was
Mayor.' and that Goldman was ex
tremely anxious to. strike up a friend
ship, which -was offensive. He also
stated that Goldman followed him to
, this city, and while he was living here
mid* himself a general nuisance. Snow
j closed his remarkable statement by de
claring that 'he believed Goldman to be
partly, insane.
A few days after Goldman had Snow
arrested on a warrant from Police
Judee Fritz on a charge of criminal
libel. Goldman's attorney stated that
a civil suit would be instituted against
Snow for $5000 and for the recovery
of $750 which was alleged to have
been loaned to Snow. The libel was
contained in the following account
sent, it was claimed, by mail by Snow !
to Goldman:
"A. Goldman, to R. W. Snow, Dr.
"For services in Oakland and San
Francisco as special attendant during
attacks of temporary Insanity from
March. 1902. to date, 51000; less cash
received, $650; balance, $350.
Goldman denied the bill, denied the
insanity charge and threatened loudly
DAUGHTER TELLS STORY. ;
\ MI?5 Gertrude Snow, the daughter of
' the wounded man, remained at his bed
side last night. She suffered severely
j from the shock, but was able to make
t the following statement:
My father met this man about three rears
j a*o. He has been the bane of poor v>apa'Â» IJ!>
j ever pinoe. In fact, he has terrorized alf our
j relatives and friend*. Because I urged rny
I father to take any mÂ»ans to get rid cf him.
j Goldman threatened my life. â¢ He learned my
j opinions of himself from a letter which he
â¢ took from rny father's pocket. I had to go to
1 Santa Clara to llTe because he told papa that
I he would kill me If I did not leave. I intended
[ to leave for Manila to escape thie persecution,

He was first treated by Dr. Frank-

escape, but was followed by Edward
Rose, clerk of the hotel, and captured
at gutter and Mason streets.
Goldman presented a picture of ab
ject dejection In the city prison. "We
met fourteen years ago," he said, 'and
?â¢verything went well until his .daughter
Interfered. I have ruined my business

EX-3IAYOR*S STORY.
In explanation of the deed Goldman
tells an extraordinary story. He
fc.cts and talks like a degener
ate and his mind is rapidly
weakening under a strain of dissipa
tion. Between sobs and shrieks he
tuld ol hi* Jealousy and hatred for Miss
Ilirtha Snow, who was trying to rid
her father of his companionship.
Goldman eays he is on the verge of
bankruptcy from providing Snow with
funds, and that the amount the latter
owes him is now between three and
four thousand dollars. Goldman asserts
that Enow took a shot at him fn a
ivdging-house at 23 Grant avenue about
two months ago and the story of the
landlady of the place and a bullet hole
lend substantiation to this story.
FIRES FIVE SHOTS.
Ex-5Iayor R. W. Snow oi Oakland
v- as shot and dangerously injured by
Adolph Goldman, a cutlery merchant
of the Â«a*ne place, at the Clarendon
Hotel on Post street, last evening. The
shooting was the result of Goldman's
ctrargt irfatuation for the ex-official,
â¢v.hich has existed for a number of
years and brought about a series of
arrests and suits that have claimed
the attention of several courts.
SPRINGFIELD. I1L. June 13.âCan
didates who are to be nominated in
the Democratic State Convention which
is called for to-morrow at noon have
been thrust into the background by the
bitter factional fight which has broken
out for the control of the State ma
chinery- The selection of a candidate
for Governor and the Question whether
Illinois shall send a delegation in
structed for Hearst occupv a large
section of the background, when com
pared with the problem whether John
P. Hopkins of Chicago shall retain his
position at the head of the State Cen
tral Committee or be deposed and his
power given to Millard- Dunlap. Theo
dore Nelson and other men who are
actively working to promote the inter
ests of Hearst.
\That Hopkins and certain of his fol
lowers jump into oblivion and allow
the world to forget them has aroused
the wrath of the Hopkins faction and
it is talking to-night of forcing Hearst
to accept an indorsement instead of
an instructed delegation, and. perhaps,
something even less valuable than an
indorsement. , i Â¦**'
The fight will open ..o-moiTOw on the
question of the selecting of a tempo
rary chairman of the convention. The
attitude of a large number of delegates
Is an unknown quantity, even to the
managers in the fight. The primaries
were held May 6. and now both sides
admit that they are not certain of the
exact number of men they. can .con
trol The Harrison, men from Cook
County, who are for Congressman Wil
liams for President, are supposed to
number 160, and they amount to little
save In the possibility of being able to
throw the balance of power In the
event of an even- break between the
Hearst and Hopkins factions. ;/*: r
Lawrence B. Springer of Lincoln.
William Prentiss of Chicago and W.
C. Crolius of" Jollet are the leading;
candidates for Governor.
The State Central Committee to-day
selected Frank P. Qulnn of Peoria for

Â£nd if Hopkins controls the convention
to-morrow his appointment will be
made permanent.
" The sub-committee to- which was
referred the hearing of contests wa-i
in session the greater part sf the
night. 1 The contests were mainly de

Â»nd it is estimated that all told 150
Hopkins delegates will be seated.
The sub-committee of the Republi
can National Committee, which haa the
arrangements for the national conven

and went over the work already done,
and completed all the remaining de
tails for the convention which -will

boat destroyers in Talienwan Bay,
near Shaopingtan, and drove them
back to Port Arthur. More than sev

Talienwan Bay. Thirty floating mines
have been found and destroyed. Some
of these were drifting into Pechili Gulf.
Tvo men who were taken prisoners
by the Japanese while on their way

On "Wednesday. June 8. a detachment
of the fleet bombarded and dispersed
two companies of Russian troops who

In an interview with Officer Creed he
said: "The whole affair is one I dis
liked very rhueh. iAvas doing my duty.
I tried toget the "commuters upon 'the
boat i so 'that we" could start out. j The
tlme'was up ari'd^jrang'thealarmbell.
iTh'erq- were about* thirty -young men
ori the^apron.' They would not allow
the apron to be raised, so I proceeded
to shove them back. "
"One fellow swore at me and I
slapped him. He struck me in the face,
and as I grappled with him to take
him. off the boat about twenty others
Jumped me. One man hit me over the
head with a satchel, while others kicked
and beat me." I defended myself the
best I could. I had no club, so that I
was soon overpowered." "
Other employes of the company who
were on the boat and saw the trouble
claim the encounter was unprovoked
by Creed.
General Manager Rank when seen at
his office claimed to know nothing of
the details and refused to make a
statement beyond the fact that the
company was investigating the matter.
Upon arriving at San Francisco Sher
man immediately took the return trip
to Sausalito and had Creed arrested
upon a charge of assault. Sherman
claims that Creed reached to each hip
pocket for a revolver, and later It was
found in the side pocket of his coat.
All those who witnessed the assault
were of the opinion that Sherman had
acted rightly x and that Creed was In the
wrong.
SAUSALITO, June 13.â Because John
Creed, a gatekeeper at the Sausallto
end of the North Shore Railroad, be
came too officious in the discharge of
his duties a small sized riot "on the fer
ry slip took place yesterday.
It has been the custom of the com
pany to allow a little time for the pur
pose' of picking up late - commuters.
Yesterday morning, without warning;
so It Is alleged, the boats were started
sharply on time. It happened that the_
boat which was to leave at 8:18 yester-T
day ha,d arrived from San Francisco a
little late and had not got rid of Its
passengers by 8:18.
After unloa'dlng the passengers there
was Ti rush from the outside for the
ticket windows by commuters who had i
hea/d the Bignal "all aboard." John :
Creed dosed the outer gate, debarring
many people who were striving to en
ter the building, and attempted to hur
ry the crowd inside on- the boat.
Frederick R. Sherman and Arthur
Gejssler, both of Sherman, Clay & Co.,
were among the crowd. Young Sher
man resented the language Creed" used,
and upon remonstrating Creed, struck
him a blow upon the temple and an
other in the mouth. Sherman swung a
right/which landed on Creed's Jaw, and
Creed clutched him by the throat, forc
ing him back to the railing. At this
Juncture Gelssler Jumped In to separate
the fwoy Creed then released his' hold
upon Sherman, . and grasping Gelssler
ran him across the wharf and backed
; him .heavily against the wall. While
this was happening excited passengers
were striking Creed with fists and
canes, one man wielding" a heavy dress
suit case against Creed's head. The
second officer and two Â¦' deckhands
Jumped in to help Creed. They suc
ceeded in driving the passengers on
the boat with the exception of young
Geissler, who remained in Creed's
clutches. '
NEW YORK, June 13.â The an
nouncement that-the Cunard Line had
met the cut in steerage rates which Its
opponents had instituted was to-day
the chief topic among steamship men.
The line had hitherto steadily^ main
tained that it would never recede from'
its standard rates and this recession
was token to mean that a bitter war
Of steamship rates will now be on. Ver
non H. Brown, general American man
ager of the Cunard Line 'authorized the
following statement:
"The Cunard Company has declined
to come down to a ten-dollar rate be
cause Its Views are in accord with
those of the immigration officials with
reference to keeping out undesirable
classes. This rate is sufficiently low
to attract the scum of Europe, and it
is very evident that a large proportion
of them will have to be deported as the
immigration officials are thoroughly
alive to the danger of permitting them
to land. Something like sixteen thou
sand steerage passengers are now on
their way to this- port and of this num
ber it is estimated that at least ten
thousand are those who have booked
passage since the J9 60 rate for steer
age passage went into effect."
The vessel which brought the first
consignment ,of the cheap rate voy
agers had almost half of them stopped
at Ellis Island. :

CHEFU, June 13.â According to the
captain of one of the Japanese cruisers
blockading Port Arthur, the Russian
cruiser Novik has been out of the har

that the obstructions at the mouth of

ning of the war.

WASHINGTON*. June 13. â That
Japan bought the Lake submarine
boat Protector is denied at the Jap
anese legation. The legation had
nothing to do with it, if the craft was
purchased by the Mikado's navy. It
would like to know more about the
deal, and the suggestion is made that
Japanese 'are named as purchasers to
throw people oft the real scent, which
would show that Russia bought the
vessel. But an equally emphatic de
nial is made at the Russian embassy.
The most plausible explanation, and
one which is borne out by many in
dications. Is that the Protector was
purchased for speculation, and there
is a strong rumor in Washington that
the Holland submarine Fulton, which
was tested on May 30 and for several
days subsequently by a board of
American naval officers, has also been
sold, but not to the United States.

QUARTERS. IX THE FIELD. Sun
day, June 12. â According to informa
tion here, the only hostilities *now oc
curring at the front are daily en
'counters between outposts, resulting in
the loss of a man or two every day.
A few Russian prisoners are being
brought into Japanese headquarters,
but no Japanese are being captured.
This is taken to show that the Japan
ese are getting the better of the en
counters.
Chinese are giving trouble by cut
ting the telegraph wires nightly; they
probably are in the pay of the Russians.
The work of keeping General Kuroki's
army in supplies of all kinls continues

and is beyond criticism. The conduct
of the Japanese soldiers is irreproach

The stcries published abroad that 600 per
sons were executed at Moscow recently, that
wholesale sentences had been Imposed at Mos
cow, ar.d that sanguinary conflicts had oc
curred at Odessa are all. so far as my in
quiries show, pure inventions deliberately set
afloat for the purpose of Injuring the Russian
loan abroad.
The Government is decidedly frank in Its
dissemination of news. Official bulletins are
posted ex-erywhere and they are read atten

and bailors are among them. The news is
discusbed among the. bystanders, but always
quietly. . There is no trace of excitement. In
fact, the war eeems to arouse less public In

African war.
Aside from th* lnitce<J:Â«.te object of my

Finlly returning to Peking, Colonel
Hayes made another journey to Japan
and saw more of the maneuvers there.
The colonel is thoroughly convinced
that the Japanese will triumph in the
present war. He regards the organiza
tion of the Japanese army as nearly
perfect and says that the patriotism of
the "little brown men" is the most re
markable In the world.
Cplonel Hayes left this country for
the Orient early in February, going by
way of Victoria with the hope of being
able to Join the Japanese army and
gettiner to the front. On reaching
Japan he was soon made to appreciate
the difficulties /that were awaiting all
who had -fdaJined to accompany the
Japanese army and hurried over into
Korea, which he reached just after the
first Japanese troops landed there.
From Seoul he traveled to the conces
sion of the American Mining Company,
in Northwestern Korea, and from there
made his way to the Yalu River.
Eventually he visited Newehwang.
Later Hayes joined â¢ Correspondent

AFTER TWKNTY-SKVKX YEARS
BROTlItUt-S ARE REUNITED
About 2000 Russian infantry from
Kaichou passed through Newehwang
this morning, accompanied by a large
supply and hospital train. Several
carts contained bandaged men. The
troops appeared to be fagged out and
showed every indication of a long,
forced march. The officers refused to
give any information, but a non-com
missioned officer told a correspondent
that all of the troops were retreating
from Tsaichou. Before he could say
anything further he was reprimanded
by a cadain.
ST. PETERSBURG, June 13.â No in
fcrmatic-n reached the general staff to
day regarding the reported ambushing
of Russians at Pulantien. as the result
of which they were alleged to have
lost SOd men. The only thing of the
least significance in this connection is
the short dispatch received from Major
General Karkevitch, which was sent
on June 12, the day the battle is said
to have occurred. General Karkevitch
does not mention -the Pulantien fight,
of which the authorities presume he
would have heard, had it occurred.
His disDatch only covered events up
to the preceding day.
Up to a late hour to-night nothing
further had been heard from Port Ar
thur.
The reports of continuous skirmish
ing along the railway south of Vafan
dien are taken to show that the Cos
saeks are keeping the Japanese busy
protecting their rear. While heavy
fighting is not regarded as being im
minent, a more or less severe brush
with the enemy is likely to occur at
any time.
NEWCHWANG. Sunday, June 12.â
Information was received here at 10
o'clock to-night through heretofore re
liable channels that part of the Japan
ese force left at Pulantien to check
mate the Russians' southward move
ment to relieve Port Arthur was at
tacked southeast of Shungmao yes
terday. After slight fighting the Jap
anese maffe a false -retreat, the Rus
sians hotly following them, when the
Japanese made a flank movement,
catching the Russians in a trap. The
Russian losses are placed at 800 men.
They fell back on Kaichou and began
to retreat along . the Baimatgu-Tsai
chou road.
The Japanese are reported to be
fortifying Laodun (which cannot be
located on available maps) and along
the railway from Pulantien to Tand
zafan. Japanese scouts are constant
ly skirmishing with Russian cavalry
south of Vafandien. Demonstrations
b> cruisers off Kalping and Senuchen
have ceased. A strong guard has oc
cupied Siuyen. A Japanese scout troop
has been seen at Kaiping road. Gen
eral Kuroki remains at Fengrvang
cheng, where the fortifications have
been strengthened. The Japanese have
retired from Saimatsza, which also has
been abandoned by most of the inhab
itants, owing to the complete exhaus
tion of supplies. Japanese forces are
reported to be occupying Alyanyamin.
The Japanese army In Manchuria is
said to be exceedingly short of sup
plies, for which it is wholly dependent
upon water transportation to the
mouth of the Yalu and Takushan.
LIAOYANG, Sunday, June 12. â A
Russian correspondent and two officers
jwho escaped from Port Arthur arrived
last night. They say that for four
days they were crawling through the
Japanese lines, the Japanese having
picketed all roads at intervals of fifty
yards. The fugitives traveled mostly
at night and kept to the hills. They
were greatly exhausted. They caught
a hospital train leaving Vafandien.
which also brought a number of men
wounded in skirmishes along the rail
road. Most of the wounded are recov
ering rapidly. Many of them have been
awarded the St. George cross.
The refugees say that Port Arthur
is well provisioned, the merchant's hav
ing managed to get in large quantities
of supplies before the railway was
cut. ';Â¦.â¢Â¦
"General Stoessel," said a general of
flcer to-day, "cannot pour fresh
strength and unshattered nerves into
his positions, whereas General Oku has
practically unlimited forces to draw
upon. The defense by the Russians
may shed luster on the Czar's arms,
but the Japanese will overwhelm all
resistance. When the Hie of the nation
is at stake the sj*criflce of even thou
sanOs of its best sons in battle becomes
insignificant in comparision."
TOKIO, June 13.â Only a limited
number personally in touch with. the
Emperor know the exact situation at
Port Arthur. The second rank of of
ficials is aware merely that the siege
is proceeding and that the climax is
likely to come at any moment. Naval
and military experts are absolutely
convinced that no amount of good
luck, gallantry or endurance can avert
the capture of the fortress. They ad
mit that the struggle may be marked
with varying fortunes from time to
time, but declare that General Oku
commands an army, large enough and
brave enough to accomplish the work
in hand.

PETALUMA. June 13.â Alf. Scott, a
brother of Joseph Scott, a prominent
lawyer of Los Angeles, and partner of
Attorney Dockweiler, died in the city
prison here on Sunday under circum
stances which have called forth the at

Scott was found at 2 o'clock Sunday
morning lying in a stupor in the streets
by Officer Mego.. Thinking the man
drunk the officer took him to the jail.
At noon the man was found to be dead.

notified. Coroner Blackburn swore to
a warrant of arrest for J. Riley, an
amateur pugilist. Riley was later re
leased on his own recognizance. Riley,
it is said, assisted in ejecting Scott
from a saloon. A second post mortem
examination showed that the man's
skull was fractured and that death was
due to this cause. Scott has been in
this city several days and is said to
have been drinklne heavily. He was
ejected from several places Saturday

none was observable and Mrs. Booth

Charles T. Connell. Chinese Inspector
at Douglas, and V. M. Clark, a special
agent, have just captured C. A. Spring
stine, hei.d of the gang of smugglers,
which turnished the Chinese with
fraudulent certificates and smuggled
them Into the United States.
Louis Greenwald, an old San Fran
cisco smuggler and " the real head of
the gang, is still at large and is be
lieved to be In Victoria. British Colum
bia. He visited Cananea, Hermosillo
and Guaymas several months ago, se
cured agents in each place and gave
Springstine a compjete outfit for man
ufacturing Chinese certificates which
can hardly be told from the genuine.
Oreenwald was to receive a commls
slc-n on all certificates sold and accord
ing to Springstine. who made a con
fession, Greenwald went to Victoria to
return with a shipload of Chinese,
which were to be smuggled into the
United States and supplied with certi
ficates at $100 per head. Greenwald
was convicted of -smuggling at San
Francisco in 1S92 and sentenced to a
term of six years in San. Quentln.
The Chinese inspectors on the inter
national line knew that the smuggling
was going on but could not locate it
until, after three months. Inspectors
Connell'and Clark found that Spring
stine was issuing the certificates. â¢
Clark posed as a confederate of
Springstine and secured the confidence
of two Chinese who had purchased
certificates. The exact location of the
plant was discovered and with the per
mission of the Mexican authorities.
Connell, Clark and other American and
Mexican officers -raided the establish
ment, arrested Springstine and took
possession of the outfit, which included
a supply of bogus certificates, stamps
for filling them In. Imitations of the
original signatures and a bogus seal,
with the following impression: "O. M.
Welburn, Internal Revenue Collector,
First District, California." This name
and title was signed to all of the bogus
certificates.
Tt T CSON, Ariz., June 13.â The Bureau
of Immigration for Arizona and New
Mexico has discovered that there are
between two and three hundred
Chinese in the two Territories who
carry illegal certificates and who have
been smuggled across the line.
Fp*cial Despatch to The Call
Recently Brigham imported com?
Kea birds from New Zealand. They
Â¦ re notorious as pheep destroyers. An
appeal to the trustees of the museum
resulted in an order to Brigham to kill
the birdE. But the curator ignored the
order, as he runs the museum. Another
attempt on the part of the professor
to import a destructive pest was frus
trated by the customs authorities. A
cocoanut-eatlng crab was the latest
agent of destruction that Brigham
wanted to "study." The crab was
brought to Honolulu on the steamship
. Ventura from Fanning I5land. The cus
toms authorities hHd up the crab and
refused to i>a?!Â« it. An appeal to the
inspector was made by a representa
tive' if the museum to admit the crab
alive. It was admitted that the crab
was a female and that the importation
of the creature alive mipht lead to an
.increase of the breed in these islands.
It v.as arpued that the crab was to be
gtudie<j for scientific purposes. The
collector deeded that he would pass a
d^ad crab with better grace than a live
one. f=o he ordered the crab destroyed.
In view of the requt-st that the im
porters wanted to preserve the crab
for mounting purposes It was decided to
chloroform the crustacean, which was
killed at the Oceanic warehouse. The
creature was a very powerful specimen
of the crab familv. Its big: claws
would have enabled it to climb the
largest cocoanijt tree. The crab climbs
trees and eats cocoanuts. It is very
destructive and has become a serious
pest in the countries where it abounds.
HONOLULU. June 4.â The Bishop
museum in Honolulu has a curator who
Is enthused with science and seemingly
has the bump of destruction largely de
veloped on his cranium. Prof. Prig
ham loves to study insects, bugs, birds,
crabs and any old thing that most peo
ple shrink from with horror. If he can
get his specimens alive bo much the
better for science. But this is where
he runs up against supar planters, live
stock men, farmers and foresters who
fear the curator's live stock may breed
too freely and be scattered far and
vide to the detriment of Invested capi
tal.

PRINCETON, N. J.. June 13.â The
Princeton faculty to-day announced a
complete revision of undergraduate
courses of studv leading to the bache
lor's degree, and the action 'has been [
passed by the trustees.
It is the most important restatement
of the Princeton course of study that
has been made since President McCosh
reorganized thp course in 1870. Candt- |
dates for -the bachelor of arts course
will be examined in the following sub- ,
jects only: The classics, mathematics, !
English,- one modern language and hia- \
tory, and candidates for the courses of j
bachelor of science and bachelor of let- i
ters will be examined 'In mathematics j
elementary physics, Latin, English his
tory and two modern languages. There
will be a reduction in the number to be
taken, each student taking five instead
of seven studies each term, with a con
sequent Increase in the amount of time
given to each course in order- to make;
it more substantial. Provision is also ,
made for insuring coherency and con- j
tinuity in the elective choices without
Interfering with thestudents' full free
dom after this essential condition for ;
the exercise of freedom has been com
plied with.
Princeton continues to stand for the,
full four-year college course, consisting ,
solely of liberal studies and organized
under as many, and only so many,
bachelor's degree as represent the lead
ing types of liberal education. Full
recognition is made of the increasing
class of students who come to college
without Greek. Those who come to
Princeton without Greek will be thor
oughly drilled in Latin and will be ex
pected to replace Greek by an addi
tional amount of mathematics and
modern languages. Both the classical
and modern sides are thus organized
on equal terms.
J. B. Patterson of Washington,
father of the prisoner; Miss McLaugh-
Hn and a man who declined to give
his nifme called upon Mrs. Patterson
at the Tombs to-day. At the end of
the interview Patterson said he waa
surprised that the Grand Jury had in
dicted his daughter. He said, how
ever, that this only strengthened his
determination to stand by the prison
er and protect her with every means
in his power.
NEW YORK, June 13. â "Nan" Pat
terson, the actress, who was y w1th
Caeaar Young, the bookmaker, in a
cab on June 4. when he was shot 3nd
killed, was to-day indicted for mur
der In the first degree. Mrs. Patter
son refused to give the details of the
shooting, except to say that Young
shot himself and that after the shoot
ing ehe had picked up the revolver
and placed it in Young's right hand
pocket.
The filing of the indictment obviat
ed the hearing of much evidence at
the Coroner's -inquest, which was held
to-day. Only a few witnesses were
examined and the jury quickly re
turned a verdict that Young came to
his death by a bullet wound.
Mrs. Patterson will be arraigned to
plead before Judge Newburger in the
Court of General Sessions to-morrow.
Mrs. Patterson was told in the Cor
oner's courtroom that she had been
indicted. For the first time since she
recovered from the first shock of
Young's death she showed emotion,
becoming hysterical. Her condition
bordered on collapse and Coroner
Jackson, who is a physician, was call
ed to attend her. Stimulants were ad
ministered and she became calmer.
Dr. Jackson said the young woman's
heart had given way under ths strain,
but that the weakness was only tem
porary.

unsuccessful attempts to ignite the
wick ar.d then took the candle from

was fa pood order and the brother
lighted Jt without trouble, but when
he replaced it in the socket it went
out. Then he removed both candle and
holder and discovered a fuse fastened
to the candlestick, which was attached
to dynamite under the altar. This
fuse was so arranged that when the
candle had burned for a certain time
It would have Ignited and caused an

Says Union Men in Cripple Creek District Admit
That Their Cause Is Lost and Are Returning to
Work Under Conditions Laid Down by Employers
DENVER. Colo., June 13.â "I think
the war is nearly over," said Governor
Peabody to-day. "I have news from
General Bell that the Cripple Creek
mines are open and running to-day
and there is comparatively little dis
affection among the men. There is no
news of further trouble or any likeli
hood of any. 1 don't know how many
men will be deported, or whether any
more will be. I have heard nothing on
that point. I learn from Captain Bul
keley Wells of Telluride that the union
men there concede that their cause i*
lost and that those of them who axe
acceptable to the mine owners are al
ready at work again. One hundred
and fifty capable men. whether union
cr non-union, have been invited to go
to work and the invitation will be
speedily accepted. In Silverton and
Ouray peace reigns. The troops have
all been ordered from Las Animas
County and only Major Hill remains
to look after the closing up of the de
tails of the campaign."
Oorvernor Peabody sent the following
reply to a message he received from
the Industrial Council of Kansas City.
condemning his action:
DENVER. Cclo.. June 13. 1904- âJ. J. Huck
ett. SÂ«:retary Industrial Council. Kansas City,
Mo". : The fact that your council indorses thÂ«
assassination*, the train wrecking and ilyr.a
mlUBff by the lawless element ia the CrippU
Creek <ilitrict but proves the necessity for my
present actioo In suppressing all euoh from
the soil cf Colorado. Become wise before you
attempt to teach.
JAME6 H. PEABODT. GoTtaor.
Governor Peabody also sent the fol
lowing dispatch in reply to a request
from an Eastern newspaper for a
statement of his reasons "for permit
ting Colorado troops to dump ninety
one union miners on the Kansas line,
leaving them destitute on the prairie,
miles from habitation":
ThÂ« reason for deporting strikers and agita
tors frcca Cripple Creek was the dynamite out
rage of June 8. whereby fourteen non-union
miners were killed, and the subsequent street
riots and klKi::i? of two non-union miners by
the same element. Suitable provlelon was eent
en the tame train with the agitators. No cases
of hunger cr suffering are reported. The con
stitution of Colorado commands the suppression
cf Insurrection by such means as may be neces
sary.
ThÂ« statement published from the headquar
ters of the Western Federation of Miner* to
the effect that the present strike- was called by
a referendum. vote and for the purpose of es
tablishing an eight-hour day Is erroneous and
false. The strike was arbitrarily called by thÂ«
executive committee of the Western Federation
of Miners and protested ajrainst by three
fourths of the miners In the Cripple Creek dis
trict. The eight-hour day bad been estab
lished and reccgnlxed for ten years past, and
employer and employed were satisfied and
wcrkins ia harmony.

WHO CANNOT BE CURED.
Backed up by over a thW of a century
of remarkable and uniform cures, a record
such as no other remedy for the diseases
and weaknesses peculiar to women ever
attained, the proprietors and makers of
Dr. Pierce's Favorite Prescription now feel
fully warranted in offering to pay $500 ia
legal money of the United States for any
case of Lencorrhea, Female Weakness,
Prolapsus, or Falling of Womb, which they
cannot cure. All they ask is a fair and
reasonable trial of their means of cure.
Â¦ I was a great sufferer for six years and doc-
tored all the time with a number of physicians
but did not receive any benefit," writes Mrs.
George Soyden. of 641 Bonda Street. Smrinaw
(South), Michigan. "I had riven np all hope of
ever getting- better. Thoojrht I would write to
you. Whea I received your letter telling me
what to do I commenced to take roar ! Favorite
Prescription* and follow yonr advice. I' have
taken ten bottles in all, also five vials of the
' Pleasant Pellets.' Aa now regular, after hav-
ing missed two years and suffered with pain ia
the head and back. I was so nervous, could not
eat or sleep. Now I can thank you - for my
recovery."
Don't hesitate to write to Dr. K. V. Pierce,
chief consulting- physician to the Invalids'
Hotel and Surgical Institute, at Buffalo,
N.Y., if yon want pood medical advice from
a fully qualified physician as to your per-
sonal good health. Such letters are always
answered free of charge and confidentially.
A medicine which has outsold all others
for women in the past third of a
century and being recommended by all .
those who have used it, is a good remedy

wife Elizabeth's suit for divorce, de
nied her allegations of neglect and
also stated that Mary J. Morlan, whom
the wife had named as one of the four

the work rooms all on one floor. * A private
switch permits thÂ« handling of freight direct
from thÂ« cars to the factory.
While it Is the purpose of the manager*
in moving to Mountain View to give special at
tention to religious and evangelical work, yet
they will continue to do commercial printing of
an unobjectionable nature, but they .Intend to
raise the standard still higher and do nothing
but first-class work of the highest order.
ThÂ« new plant will be well- equipped for
doing all kinds of printing, bookbinding and
engraving, 'Under one roof and one maagement.
The new factory Is nearlng completion and
they expect to bepin to move the plant early
In July, but thrre will be no interruption in
'business. They have presses and machinery
Bufflclent to kkep things moving at -both ends
of the line. All machines are run with elec
tric motors, thus simplifying the work. .
. The counter checkbook business, formerly
carried on by the Pacific Press, has been sold
for cash to the Pacific Manifold Book Com
pany, now established in Oakland on the cor
ner/ of Second and Oak streets. The sale of
this business furnishes the capital with wftlch
to erect^ the new factory at Mountain View.
The resolution upon the .removal of
the Healdsburg college reads: .
It ha* been decided that the Pacific PreÂ«a
will reorganize. Instead of being a stock
holders' organization the management of the
Institution will herearter be thrown â¢ more
fully into the bamls of the Seventh Day Ad
ventlst denomination residing within its ter-
OAKLAND, June 13.â The Seventh
Day Adventists have closed their an
nual camp meeting, which has ':cen in
progress in this city for two weeks,
and which is in reality the annual busi
ness meeting of the many industries
and organizations of that sect. This
meeting has been c-ne of the most im
portant in the history of the order, for
two important moves were decided
upon. The Pacific Press Publishing
Company, the Ceventh Day Adventist
church and the general Seventh Day
Adventist settlement in Oakland will
all be removed to Mountain View,
Santa Clara County. The Adventist
College at Healdsburg will also be re
moved to some spot not yet selected.
ThcSe two moves will be an abandon
ment of what have been the great cen
ters of Adventism in California.
The move from Oakland has been
under contemplation for some time and
a committee has been at work which
finally presented the plan that was
adopted at the annual meeting of the
Pacific Press Publishing Company.
The statement of reasons and
plans is made as follows:
Knowledge of the efforts to get Mr.
Craw'g services in Hawaii has reached
the fruit men of California. Mr. Stabler
of Yuba City first learned of It, and he
has been trying hard to persuade Mr.
Craw to remain in California, Mr.
Stabler says that the canners of this
State are. all anxious that Mr. Craw
shall remain at his present post. Gov
ernor Pardee has been Informed of the
move In Hawaii.
Alexander Craw Is sought by the Ha
waiian Government and the Hawaiian
sugar planters. They want his services
badly enough to offer him $5000
per annum and to guarantee him that
rate of Income for live years. Mr. Craw
receives from the State only $20Q per
month as quarantine officer to prevent
the introduction of pests injurious to
vegetation and also to make cultures
and Importations of beneficial parasites
that prey* upon scales of many varie
ties. He has occupied this position
many years and his labors have saved
millions of dollars to. the fruit growers
by preventing the extermination of
trees and the ruin of growing crops.
The loss to the sugar planters in the
Hawaiian Islands last year by the leaf
hopper, that destroys the sugar cane,
is estimated at millions of ftollars.
There are in the Territory of Hawaii
seven entomologists of ability, but not
one of them has wide experience as a
quarantine officer to keep pests out of
the country. Good work has( been done
In . Hawaii in extirpating pests that
have been found to be ravaging the
growing cane, but new pests have been
brought in and the planters have de
termined that something radical must
be done.
Mr. Thurston of Honolulu is in the
city and he has urged upon Mr. Craw
the desirability of the position that' is
offered him. The Government is to pay
a part of the salary of $5000 per annum
and the planters the remainder. The
Government guarantees the payment
of the entire sum. Craw is offered the
place of chief entomologist, or head of
the entomological service. Within the
last two dayg the cable between Hono
lulu and this city has been used to per
suade Mr. Craw. What his decision
will be is not determined.

OAKLAND, June 13. â Carrie H.
Rountree was granted a divorce to
day from James O. Rountree on the
ground of desertion. W. I. Berriman
uas granted a divorce from Rosa M.
Berriman for cruelty. The interloc
utory decree granted Ida M. Wheeler
from John Wheeler last June was
made final. Suits for divorce were
begun to-day by Mary A. Winckler
from William J. Winckler for deser
tion, and Annie E. Cook from Robert

Inhappy Spouses.
The site for the new building, at
Fourteenth and Jefferson streets, has
been paid for with the exception of
$5000, and this Indebtedness will , be
cleared within the next sixty days, if
the association succeeds in securing the
necessary funds to bind all the pledges
to the building fund work will be be
gun on the new building. as soon ag
suitable plans are approved by the
board of directors.
With all but $8150 pledged out of the
$150,000 necessary to assure the imme
diate erection of a new building, the
Young Men's Christian Association is
facing a most serious difficulty. Unless
the entire amourJ is secured by mid
night of June la the pledges already
obtained will lapse, releasing the sign
ers from their obligations.
It is not probable that the association
would even under these circumstances
lose all the funds already raised for the
new building. Many subscribers would
not withdraw their subscriptions, even
though the terms of their contracts al
low them to do so, but' several of the
largest donations already made were
promised on condition that the entire
amount of the $150,000 be raised by June
15, 1904. It is these pledges, aggregating
more than half the total, that are
placed in jeopardy. The officers of the
association are using every effort to
complete the fund in order to bind the
contract and secure the money already
pledged.
Collections for the new Young Menjs
Christian Association building were
taken yesterday in many of the local
churches, and partial reports of the re
sults were made known this morning.
The First Presbyterian and First Meth
odist churches gave $260. Ten other
churches still remain to be heard from,
and until their reports are received the
exact amount of the deficit will not be
known

"Under the law and the evidence in
this case, Mangin. the court cannot
find you guilty. If the charge had
been that of disturbing the peace I
would have found you guilty and sent
you to jail. My advice to you is that
you stop being a crank and put away
your guns and piptols."
After Mangin had proved that the
weapon was not loaded Police Judge"
Fmith said:
OAKLAND, June 13. â Because the
Supreme Court has said that an un
loaded pistol is not a deadly weapon
when aimed at a person. August Man
gin, an eccentric capitalist, escaped
conviction and a term in the City
Prison to-day in the Police Court.
Mangin brandished an empty re
volver at Harry_JIiddleton, a boy, and
threatened dire things unless the
youth should stop nailing wire net-'
tin? to a fence that separated ibV
Mangin and Middleton back yards at
Thiry-fourth street and Broadway.
Mangin gained his point, but the boy
t a used his belligerent neighbor's ar
rest on a charge of "exhibiting a
deadly weapon in a rude and threaten
ing manner."

Another point made by the company
is that it required a statement of the
book accounts kept by McKowen each
year before renewing the bond. In
each of these statements it was said
that McKowen's work was entirely sat
isiactory. and it was only upon those
f-tatements that the'oompany consented
to renew the bond, and had the books
been properly experted and a true
statement made to the company it
would not have allowed itself to be
come responsible for any part of the
551,429 2S that was stolen.
The Pacific States Surety Company,
in an answer filed to-day to a suit
brought against it by the Regents of
the University of California, denied
that it is responsible" to the extent of
S5000 for the defalcation of W. A. Mc-
Kowen. For a number of years the
surety company supplied a bond in the
fum of $5000. but this.' it is stated, was
allowed to run out July 1. 1903.
The company c-laims that its respon
sibility terminated, according to its
â¢ ontract, three months later, whereas
the defalcation was not discovered un
til December 19.

When the death was reported to the
police, Detectives Shorey and Holland
were sent out and took Oliver to the
police station, where a formal charge
was placed against him.
The child was the son of E. F. Lee,
684 Castro street, and the accident oc
curred close to the Lee home. He was
playlng'in the street when Oliver drove
by with a four-horse team hauling hay.
Oliver saw the child run out but knew
nothing of the accident until he heard
some one call out. Thinking one of
his bales had tumbled off\he stopped
his horses, looked around and saw the
child lying in the street. He went
back and had the little fellow carried
to the hospital. Dra. R. W. Emerson
and A. S. Kelly found the mangled
body of the injured child past all medi
cal aid. He died a couple of hours
later. â¢
Lyle Lee, a five-year-old boy, was
run over this afternoon by a heavy
hay wagon driven by Albert Oliver of
the firm of Oliver & Smith and died
this evening of his 'injuries at the Re
ceiving Hospital. The wheels passed
over the child's thighs, crushing the
bones and inflicting internal injuries.
Oliver was arrested after the death of
the^ child and taken to the police sta
tion, where he was released on his own
recognizance.

FLEADOM has been startled by the announcement
that a Los Angeles* man has invented a flea trap.
There is weeping and wailing and gnashing of
teeth in the exclusive arid othe^r circles of the pulex
irritans, but joy reigns supreme wherever this frisky
and elusive parasite makes life miserable. The authori
ties at Washington evidently consider the product of the
Los Angeles inventor a boon to mankind, for they have
promptly issued a patent to him, and we may expect,
therefore, to hear soon that the trap is in successful
operation and that all sufferers from the agile insect
which is possessed of a suctorial proboscis are enjoying
gratifying relief.
It will be interesting to know how this newest of traps
is constructed and how it is to be used. Is it large or
is it small?, If it is large and it is 'placed in a corner
or in the middle of the room, will it be taken for a mouse
trap and lure the small rodent quadruped to its fatal por
tals? Or, if it is small, will man dangle it from his watch
chain or wear it under his suspenders? And will lovely
woman have if. hanging from a string of beads, or, in
stead, conceal it beneath her peek-a-boo shirt waist?
And what sort of bait will prove most alluring to the
intended victims? Of course, the trap will have to be
baited, otherwise Mr. Flea/and Mrs. Flea and all the
baby fleas, and their sisters and their cousins and their
aunts will hop, skip and jump by the trap, igtving, it but
passing notice, continuing without let or hindrance
their jolly gymnastics and. attendant feasting. Surely
cheese cannot be used as. bait,. for, every man would then
shun his neighbor as though he were a leper.. Nor would
sugar do, for the saccharine substance would attract the
members of the musca domestica , family, commonly
called flies. And no man and no woman,: nowadays, cares
to have any one say, "There are flies on you."

rpHE great cause of personal and political rightcous-
I ness in its march through our States and Terri

sota, and as a result the chairman of the Democratic
committee is in the hospital with a split lip and a scalp
stitched like a baseball cover. The Hearst movement
in that State seems to work like a. cyclone; and those
who get in the way are guilty of contributory negligence.
The telegraph flashes the news that when the Hearst
banner, inscribed with the legend, "Purity and Reform,"
was( unfolded in that State a pocketbook was unfolded
also, and that thereafter it became easy to get the
primaries in Minneapolis. In St. Paul, however, the
bearers of the banner proposed to let virtue be its own
reward, and Mr. Hearst did not get a single delegate.
From this we assume that in the Minnesota Democracy
virtue does not pay as high wages as other .employers,
and if she is working as a side partner of Mr Hearst
he ought to send a disbursing agent with her on these
business trips.
Mr. Dan Lawler of Minneapolis, anti-Hearst and good
fighter, failed entirely in opposing the great purist and
reformer, while over in St. Paul, with only the memory
of Pat Kelly to lead, reform and purity of the Hearst
brand had not whereon to .lay its head.

interest is declining in both Hearst and Parker. Mr.
Hearst's lavish assistance extended to the needy Democ

parent that his disbursers were getting more of the
needful than did the needy. Judge Parker, the farmer
of Esopus, had some vogue until friendly reporters'be

with them has never again been ques

The professor possesses a marvelous
knowledge of Oriental tongues. Aided
by this and disguised as a native in
most instances he was able to study
almost unknown Eastern countries
with greater accuracy.
One of the principal results of his
travels through Central Asia was to
make him a Russophobe and an Anglo
phile, for he maintains that the Rus
sians are the worst civilizers of -bar
barous and semi-barbarous nations,
while Anglo-Saxons are the best. Pro
fessor Vambery regards the possession
of India by the British as a blessing
for the native population and for hu
manity, end on the other hand he
would regard the capture of India by
Russia as a misfortune for the natives
and for humanity. He has never
ceased to wain England and the world
of Russia's dark designs in Asia, which
he has done as much as any one to cir
cumvent.
Professor Vambery Is a personal
friend of the Sultan Abdul Hamid, and
he regards Turkey's ruler as a much
maligned monarch who Is unjustly held
responsible for the misdeeds committed
by his ministers and courtiers. Vam
bery has written much In defense of
the Sultan In this sense. Long after he
became a persona, gratisslma at - the
English court, Vambery was excluded
from high society in Budapest, where
he resides, so that when the present
King of England, then Prince of Wales,
paid a visit to Budapest, he was greatly
surprised not to meet the professor at
several of the dinners given In his
honor by members of the Hungarian
nobility.
Tbe Prince called on Vambery to ask
him why he was not present, and on
hearing that Vambery was not in the
most exclusive set, he said: "Professor,
to-morrow there Is a grand ball at
Prfnce Esterhazy's house. I will p'ro
cure you an Invitation, and you wait
for me outside the ballroom." The
next night the elite of Hungarian soci
ety had assembled to meet the Prince
of Wales, and the distinguished com
pany were awaiting his entry into the
ballroom, when the doors were thrown
open, and the future King of England
appeared with his arm llnked*in Vam
bery's. In this way he walked down
the ballroom and taking the explorer
up to several Hungarian magnates, he
asked them, "Don't you know my very
good friend Vambery, who has con
ferred more honor on Hungary than
Hungary has on him?"

The entirely new feature which tlws

of what may be called the traveling
habit. There are citizens of New Eng
land to-day who can remember when
prayers were offered In the churches
for the hardy traveler of Boston who
proposed to undertake a trip to New
York. Steam communication has les
sened tenfold the minimum amount of
urgency which would induce a trip of
a hundred miles, but it has remained
for the electric road to keep people con
stantly traveling short distances. Im
pelled by motives which would not
have been sufficient to start them even
five years ago. A twenty-mile Journey
on a steam railroad requires as much
preparation as a 200-mile Journey, but
the interurban car, leisurely traversing
the streets of the town to collect Its
passengers at frequent Intervals Is such
a convenient, lazy way of getting
around that it seems not to require
much in the way of plans or of pack-
Ing. To choose between the morning
train at 8:13 and the afternoon train at
3:57 required decision^ to eat^n the
train required forethought; while now
adays if at 10 a. m. it seems casually
.advisable to go to Jonesport, all that is
necessary is to wait for the hourly ln
terurban car to pass the door. â Ray-

s In California nature lures the children of men to a
summer rest. This State was planned for vacation time.
A few hours' travel at slight expense will relocate us
in the midst of just such a change, of scene, surround
ings and altitude as we require. From, the hot valleys
our people can go to the mountains, where waterfalls
tinkle and brooks babble, and bosky dells and the glory
of wild flowers make them forget the cares of life and
the jostle of the madding crowd, or with equal ease and
economy they can seek the sea coast and sport on the
beach, refresh them in the surf or lie in the sand "and
hear the great voice of the vast ocean, restless itself
but preaching rest tojthose who listen.
Wise are the men and women who plan a vacation
and take it, not in the contacts of a fashionable resort,
but by seeking the mountains or the shore where they
cap^-sast off the restraints of convention, wear comfort
able clothes, eat reasonable food, keep natural hours
and renew the wholesome experiences of life, which are
apt to get overrun in the rush and hurry. If money
making were all there is of life. Russell Sage's idea
would be justified. But it is far from. all, and it seldom
sweetens existence when made the chief end of man.
It is among the minor motives of existence, and when
it is not made to serve nobler things, but becomes the
master motive, it is little conducive to happiness.
WITH the close of the schools in mid June the
California vacation begins. Russell Sage, who
.is hale, hearty and acquisitive at near ninety
years, has recently decried vacations. He thinks them,
bad for a man. unfitting him to do good work when he
gets back to his office. On the other side, the late Sen
ator Stanford said it was impossible to do much work
without taking .much leisure. It is also reported re
cently that birhkers in the East look with suspicion upon
clerks who do not- go out to lunch and avoid taking
vacations. It is said that experience in embezzlements
and defaults proves that such. clerks are usually the ones
who rob the bank.
We think that Mr. Sage is wrong." Probably he has
made it profitable to avoid vacations and put in his time
studying games, in which he can outplay the other
financiers who are resting by\the sea or in the moun
tains. But it will not do to evolve, a: general rule from
his experience.

garian opinion to the j contrary not
withstanding, it is impossible to com- j
pare the genius of the late Marcus j
Jokai with that of Alexander Dumas.
but In almost every other respect the (
famous Magyar novelist was the coun- j
terpart of the great Frenchman. In |
actual fertility Jokai surpassed "The
Three Musketeers'" author, for 'even
with the assistance of his faithful
corps of literary hacks, Dumas never
equaled the' Hungarian's tale of 200
romances and 350 collections of poet
ical works, not to mention several
plays. Jt is probable, in fact, that this
is a world's record. Like Dumas, Jo
kai had lived a life full of adventure
â and one that included a lot of ac
tual fighting â before he turned to ro
mance writing as a trade. Bluff good
humor was one of the most striking
qualities of both men's work and Jo
kai resembled Dumas in writing al
most entirely on impulse â seldom
knowing in advance what <vas going
to happen to his characters. Both
romancers were also dramatists, both
editors at one time or another. Like
Dumas, again, Jokai died practically
a poor man simply as the r-\'Â»^ of
open handedness to all and sundry
who applied to him. The waifs and
strays that perpetually were quartered
upon him in his house at Budapest
were exactly the sort of parasites that
Dumas maintained at his chateau of

At a recent State conference of Democrats in St. Paul
the argument submitted was up to that high standard
which the opposition has found it expedient always to
maintain. Several debaters were sent to a hospital, an
incipinent riot was suppressed -and an overcharged at
mosphere for blocks around demonstrated to the most
incredulous that the Democracy of Minnesota is health
ful, vigorous and mentally normal.

It is perhaps easy to control an independent manufac
turer and compel him to enter, a rival combine or go
out of. business, but'this is impossible in mining. When
a Mexican peon can find a mine, as Pedro Alvarado did,
and in a year acquire such wealth that he can afford to
offer to pay the national debt of Mexico, the difference
between mining and manufactures in tfie power of com
bination over them is made apparent. The recent reve
lations in copper in Alaska prove that even that metal
cannot long remain in the control of any combination.
Again, it is hardly possible to apply to mining of its
many kinds the principles by which the Standard Oil
Company has made its profit, which has been won by
economizing in methods and cheapening the product to
the consumer. Gold cannot be cheapened, from the
present outlook* It is not a perishable property like
oil that must be consumed in order to earn a profit to
its producer. While some is lost and \ wasted, or put
where it is not a part of the actual currency of- the
world, still, fixed in position hi the arts or wherever it
is, it is potential money.
It is said that the gold stored in the Vatican in ob
jects of art and in other forms equals in value the gold
coined and used as money by the entire continent of
Europe. But that Vatican gold is merely stored. It
is not consumed nor destroyed, and it is easily think
able that if the world's need of gold as money grew
strong enough to outweigh the considerations
which keep it stored in- other forms, it would be made
mobile to respond to that need.
Of course there will at once arise a fear that such a
combination as this engineered by .Rockefeller may. so
control the output of the precious metals as to pinch
the nations that use them as currency. But with the
mines of Siberia and South Africa in operation and con
stant discoveries in Alaska, it is difficult to see how this
could be done. If attempted, it might have the same dis
astrous effect on the combine thatythe independent out
put of copper forced upon the So/iete des Meteaux, the
first copper trust, in which Mr. Haggin had some quite
disagreeable experiences.
It is probable, too, that such a policy would run up
against the law. If a railroad merger is in restraint of
trade, how, much more is it in restraint of trade to, at_
tempt to limit the output of the^money metals which
are the very blood in the arteries of commerce?
As the resources of the law have thus far proved
adequate to control for the public interest all other
forms of combinations, and <as none has been found will
ing, even if able, to long defy both natural and statute
law,Â»the people can afford to wait with patience until
Mr. Rockefeller's plans and'purposes are more fully
disclosed, and if they run counter to the public welfare
the people and the law will know where to strike him.
THE latest report about John D. Rockefeller
charges him with a design to merge the mines of
America and perhaps of the world in one combina
tion, headquarters under his hat. These mining combi
nations have heretofore been managed by the Roths
childs, who are supposed to control the world's produc
tion of quicksilver. and copper. If an American has risen
who can see the Rothschild hand and go one better, it
is a matter of interest to financiers.
As a m&tter of fact great mining combinations are
not nejv in this country. The Haggin and Hearst in
terests were equal in holdings to the Standard Oil be
fore it invaded Europe. Senator Clark has a genius
for such combinations, and his interests run from Mon
tana to Mexico. It is not plain that he and Heinzc and
Senator Kearns and the Haggin interests will gain by
going into the larger Rockefeller combination, as it is
reported they intend doing.
The silver mines of this country and Mexico are al
ready practically controlled by the Guggenheims, who
are believed to have been responsible for the advance
in the price of silver which began last year. A mining
combination differs from one made in manufactures.
The history of gold discoveries in Colorado and Utah
and in Alaska proves that no one can estimate the fu
ture of that leader of the precious metals. ~\As gold in
the ground is potential money of practically unchange
able value, the next prospector may make a find that
will be entirely independent of Rockefeller and Roths
child combined.
must sing his praises, for he has done nobly, in,deed. in
giving to a long-suffering world an article that will have
as much terror for the pulex irritans as cyclones have
for the Kansans, or Japanese mines and torpedoes have
for the Muscovites*. Before long we shall be hearing
this query in streetcars Â»nd on street corners: "How
is your flea trap working to-day?"

All the literarv charm of a Shakes
pearean legend and all the best effects
that modern stagecraft could devise â
such was the presentation of "The
Proud Prince" by E. H. Sothern and a
capable supporting company last even
ing at the Columbia Theater.
The play was written by Justin
Huntly McCarthy, and its theme is
the psycho-religious fable of a King
of Sicny whose soul was as bad as its
tenement was handsome. This mon
arch ecoffs at heaven's might until the
Archangel transtorms him into a being
with person as repellant as his mind.
In this Callbanistic condition he passes
through various stages of suffering un
til the heart purification gradually ef
fected through his seemingly hopeless
passion for a pure young girl redeems
him and restores his former estate.
Longfellow has sung the story and
all its poetic worth has been utilize'd
by the dramatist. Through four acts
the symbolical meaning is sustained in
lines that are true literature, action
that is illuminative and scenes that
are near \he acme of stage ingenuity.
McCarthy calls his work "a miracle
play." but it is much more convinc
ing than it could have been when the
churcbr taught some of Its lessons
through the medium of the mummer.
The lesson is embellished with all that
has been learned of stage art since the
fifteenth century.
Sothern's acting as the King won
for him half a dozen curtain calls at
the conclusion of each act. It would
have been great acting without the
pictorial accessories, and with them it
served to rouse the big and cultured
first-night audience to a pitch of en
thusiasm rarely attained in that house.
His exhibition of the King's brutal ar
rogai.ee in the first actâ where he was
the despot who neither spared maiden
ly honor nor heeded manly protest
was as thrilling in its repulsive way
as was his subsequent writhing of soul.
All Sothern did was thoroughly con
vincing. Miss Jane Laurel shared most
of the recalls with him and she fairly
earned the honor, for a more natural
young actress has never . been seen
among Sothern's associates. Her in
genuousness was accentuated by the
artistic way in which Mi3s Affle War
ner played the wanton favorite of the
Kingâ a part that necessitated a keen
sense of repression. The slightest bit
of. over-exuberance would have made
it a less interesting performance. Both
women are richly blessed with person
ality and talent. The remainder of the
big cast was entirely adequate.
If given a decade s>~o â when Fanny
Davennort's trees were torn up in the
Egyptian storm during her perform
ances of the Nile sirenâ the electrical
effects introduced in the first act cf
"The Proud Prince" would have cre
ated a sensation; and even now, when
such effects are-, no rarity, they are
well worth witnessing. The scenery,
too, could not be more elaborate or ar
tistic and the incidental and entr'
acte mus! . of which there is a great
deal, enhances the intelligibility of the
scenes by its thorough appropriate
ness.
As a whole "The Proud Prince" is a
most satisfactory performance and the
folk in all parts of the theater last
night so pronounced it.
A fine opal, eet in diamonds, is Les
l?e Carter's Du Barry, seen here for the
first time last night at the Grand
Opera-house. The production itself is
the last word of riotous splendor.
Nothing before seen in San Francisco
approaches it in sumptuous, luxurious
magnificence, m overwhelming beauty
of picture. Beiasco is said to have
spirit JS3.000 upon the settings â and
"you can see the money," as Fred Be
l*sco put* It. Three thousand dollar
<juUts are spread recklessly on the Du
Harry's bed; old French medalsâ seen
for one flash of a moment â glitter on
i he courtiers' breasts, and if there are
not the louis in Jeanne's money
box when the bribes Du Barry, 'tis only
i^cause David Belasco could not buy
'em.
But it is only in the off moment one
finds time to note this gorgeousness cf
Mtting, for setting: it is. One remem
bers only the lavish splendor of the
Da Barry boudoir, onyx-pillared, and
with its Parian cupids, when the Du

and the Du Barry is the play. Bo the
audience decided last night â a sumptu

tive crowd that sent up as many salvos
as there were seatsâon- silent back

seemed to matter. For was It not Wiz

MAKES FREE WITH HISTORY.
Why Berlin rejected "Du Barry" is
easily enough surmised. In the "first
place, Frau Odilon played the chief
ro!<s and not Mrs. Carter. In the sec
ond. Mr. Belascn has played affright
ing tricks with the historic fact. This,
however, he confesses freely upon the
rrogramme. Most vitally Mr. Belasco's
historic juggling concerns the charac
ter of his heroine. History records no
redeeming trait in the royal harlot's
makeup. Yet history may lie. and Mr.
Belasco see more clearly in ascribing a
pure passion to King Louis' extravagant
mistress. This, however, does not ex
ruse the dramatist for impossibly tak
ing the old Due de Brissac and trans
forming him into the hero of Jeanne's
imagination. Nor should plausibility
have been so roughly impinged upon as
it is in making ever the lazy, good
natured Louis XV into a jealous, ex
acting lover. Still, these and other aJ- i
teratior.s undoubtedly conduce to dra
matic interest. This must be their ex
cuse. As it Is, "Du Barry" has the grip
of the best of the Sardou genre, of
which it most strong'. y reminds.
FICTIOX VERSUS TRUTH.*
One would like to see what Mrs. Car
ter would have done with th? Du Barry
of history, the creature completely sor
did, absolutely vain, fantastically" cruel
and wholly ar.imal. In the Belasco
play she is permitted to arouse sym
pathy at the outset, and to retain it
throughout the whol<Â» course of the
drama by her unselfish devotion to De
Prissac. She is seen first as the little
milliner of Labille's. fond cf a gay
gown and careless of holes in her stock
ings, hating work, and with all the
f asy coquetry of her class. Very clever,
fresh, piquant is Mrs. Carter's comedy
here. The scene itself, with the work- |
ing girls and handsome fall-lals of the
trade about, is very effective.
The next scene finds the little mil
liner as a decoy in a fashionable*gam
ing parlor. Here the Du Barry begins
to put on airs and have tempers, and
the coming favorite of the king, with
her bath tub of gold, her caprice, her
power. Is clearly suggested. Something
very gracefully ingenuous is her Tje
wttÂ£erment at the battling impulses
she finds in her breast, as disclosed in
her scene in this act with De Brissac.
MRS. CAKTER AT HER BEST.
But It is in the third act one g-ets the
Carter quality. Things begin to hiss
here. It is when she holds a morning
reception, with cardinals to put on her

Secretary Says That United
States' Act Will Receive
Attention, of- Government
LONDON, June 13.â Lord Muskerry
(Conservative) in the House of Lords
to-night questioned the Government
concerning the reservation of other
countries of coastwise trade to vessels
of their own nationality, and especial
ly to the proposed application to the
Philippine Islands of the coastwise
Jaws of the United States.
Foreign Secretary Lansdowne re
plied. He said the proposed restric
tion on the Philippines seemed Incon
sistent with certain declarations of
the United States Government at the
time of the drawing up of the treaty
of peace. The British representative
in Washington, the Secretary added,
had been requested to call the atten
tion of the United States Government
to the matter and point out the detri
mental effect of the restrictions on
British trade.
The discussion, he said, was still
proceeding at Washington, and it
would not be In the public interest to
enter into details regarding / the ex
change of views. The law does not
take effect until 18S6. Therefore there
is plenty of time to consider the mat
ter, which deserves and will receive
the attention of his Majesty's Govern
ment. '^--- \ Â¦

TMI ICKTAUM COÂ«nn. HCW TOM MTV.NEW YORK, June 13.â Malcolm
Ward successfully defended his title
as Metropolitan lawn tennis champion
here to-day by defeating the challeng
ing player, Robert Leroy of Columbia,
lnÂ«three straight setsâ 6-3, 6-2, 6-1.
Ward Still a. Champion.
BUTTE, Mont., June 13. â Benny
Yanger, the "Tlpton Slasher." took the
count In the eighth round to-night
when Aurelio Herrera of Bakersfield,
Cal., landed his famous punch. Yang
er's fighting was faster than any for
mer opponent Herrera has met, but
notwithstanding his advantage In
speed he was â¢ a comparatively easy
victim for the Mexican, who played a
waiting game, plodding slowly for an
opportunity to land, that single blow
that has sent so many to the mat.
Toward the last of the eighth, and
while close to the ropes, Herrera land
ed an awful right swing on Yanger's
jaw during a fierce mix-up. Crossing
with his left to the same point, -he
dazed the Italian, and before the man
from Tipton could cover two more
fierce right arm swings found the Jaw
and Yanger went down.
At the. count of nine he started to
rise, when Herrera again tapped him
on the Jaw, which sent . him
down for good. Herrera used
his crouch once or twice when
the mix-ups got- too , warm, " but
generally fought open, and his clever
work showed him to be at his best.
Yanger was thought to be In perfect
condition. The purse was 52500.
BUTTE, "Mont., June 13.â Jack
O'Keefe and "Honey" Mellody went
twenty rounds to a draw here to-day
for the white welter-weight champion
ship. Up to the seventeenth round the
light was Mellody's. He did all the
leading, and repeatedly sent O'Keefe
to the ropes. In the eighteenth round
O'Keefe rallied strongly and made such
a showing that Referee Duncan Mc-
Donald called the fight a draw. The
men weighed In at 142 pounds. Fully
5000 people witnessed the bout.

In addition to being the captain of

been the best pitcher In college. In his
four years he has lost only, five games,
three to Princeton .and one: each to
Georgetown : and .Williams, ~
CAMBRIDGE, Mass., June 13.âWal
ter Clarkson, captain and pitcher of
the Harvard varsity nine, was to-night
barred from further participation in
college games by a vote of the Har
vard athletic committee. /Clarkson has
signed a contract with the New York
American team, thereby violating: the
rule governing Harvard athletes.
At a meeting of the athletic commit
tee to-night Clarkson denied he had
signed a contract for an annual salary
of $8000, but made a statement In which
he said on May 6 he signed a contract
to play ball with the New York Amer
ican team the coming season and that
on that day he was paid a consider
able sum outside of the money stipu
lated in his contract as an inducement
to sign the contract at once. By a
verbal agreement with Captain Grif
fith the Harvard man was not to begin
work with the New York team until
after the close of the college season.
Clarkson said that it was his inten
tion to keep the matter secret until. the
college i season had closed. , His last
game with Harvard was played against
Amherst last Wednesday. He has
played in six games since signing with
New York.
Although the college season is nearly
closed there still remain two games
with Yale on the 23d and ; 28th and
Clarkson'a absence will be seriously
felt.

Frank McConnell. the pride of the
city a few years ago, then came up,
and Munroe followed the clever welter
weight around the ring and refused
to be feinted out. It was a fast round,
with McConnell leading often "and
Munroe always there with the block.
Jack's footwork was very fast, and he
surprised the big crowd by the clever
manner in which he boxed his agile
opponent.
Trainer in Chief Tim McOrath saved
Andy Gallagher for the last two
rounds. These were about the swift
est of the bunch, and it was then that
the big miner showed his speed. He
landed some jolty ones on Andy's head
and body, and the latter was glad
when it was all over. He finished up
the day by tossing the medicine ball
with Gallagher, and after his rub
down looked better than ever before.
He commenced with big Jack Sulli
van, and at the end of one fast round
Sullivan was all used up and read*
to drop. Joe Long came next, and the
miner's stiff wallops to the body did
not do Long any good. He rushed the
big fellow at times, but always ran
into a straight left when he came fast.
At the end of the round Munroe hit
his man a punch on the Jaw that all
but dropped him.
Jack Munroe put in a hard day's
work yesterday afternoon at his train
ing quarters. After breaking the small
punching bag and bustling the sand
bag in a lively manner, the miner got

it decidedly interesting for four of
them.

KEW YORK, June 13.â An agree
ment has been reached and articles
will be signed shortly for a six-round
boxing match between Robert Fitzsim
tnons end "Philadelphia Jack" O'Brien.
The bout will be held In the open air
In the Philadelphia ball park. The ex
art date will be decided when the
articles are signed. The men will weigh
in at 166 pounds.
When Jeff arose yesterday morning
and started in to work he did not feel
right. The injured knee, while not
bad to look upon, was stiff, and it
bothered the big fellow when he tried
to exercise. He did not despair at
first, but tried to go through his stunts
in the gym. The more he worked,
however, the worse the knee got, and
finally he held a consultation with
Trainer "Billy" Delaney. They decided
to announce that It would be impos
sible for the champion to fight before
June 24.
Delaney communicated with Coff
roth and the latter at once decided
to give the champion a few days of
grace and put the date over till June
30. This seemed to meet with the ap
proval of Munroe's manager, Harry
Pollock. The champion will probably
be satisfied, as a few days' rest will
do him good.
"We are very sorry that the fight
goes over," said Billy Delaney last
night, "but there is nothing else to be
done. The big fellow is not right and
he will not take any chances of losing
the title he battled hard to gain and
maintain. It is out of the question
for Jeff to enter the ring before the
24th, ns his knee is stiff, and rest Is
the only remedy for it. We will re
main at the springs till a day or two
before the fight, so that Jeff will have
plenty of time to train. He will be
fit by the 24 th."
Harry Pollock will not claim Jeffries'
$2500 forfeit. "We came out here to
James J. Jeffries nnd Jack Munroe
will not clash for the heavy-weight
championship of the world until
Thursday evening, June CO. The post
ponement was decided upon last night
by MaiTager CofTroth of the Yosemite
Club after he received a dispatch from
"Billy" Delaney saying that the cham
pion's knee was still bothering him
and asking that the fight be postponed
one week at least.
Manager Coffroth said last night
that the tickets already sold for the
big fight will be good on the night of
June 30 and that there will be. no
change In the seating arrangements
of the pavilion.
"I do not want to fight a lame man,"
said Jack. "Let him get into the best
possible condition, and then there will
be no hollering if the mill goes against
him. A few days' extra training will
do me good."

champion's money," said he. "Of
course, it is too bad that a postpone
ment is necessary, but we are willing
to stand for it and give Jeff all the
time he wants to train. It will do
Munroe good to work a few days
lonper."
When told of the postponement
Munroe did not seem at all concerned.

Pursuant to orders of Mayor Harri

not to he permitted in Chicago in any
form, Chi?f of Police O'Neill declared
to-night that the orders would be car
ried out to the letter. The book
makers hÂ«ve announced that they in
tend to do business at Washington
Park this year as usual, and unless
one side or the other changes its atti
tude a serious clash seems inevitable.
The war against the bookmakers is
one result of the fight now being
waged by the University of Chicago
and other owners of property in the
district in Â¦which the racetrack lies to

Washington Park track management

CHICAGO. June 13. â A riot similar

GRAVESEND, June 13.â Every fav
orite was beaten to-day and bookmak
ers went home in much better spirits
than on any day recently. Tales of
Individual losses by plungers were rife
all afternoon. Joe Yeager alone, it was
said, lost $25,000 on Conjurer and Mi
mosa in their respective races. E. E.
Smathers was $.10,000 poorer after the
defeat of Stolen Moments in the fifth
event.
But a small amount *was won on
Pierre Lorillard's Chrysltls, when that
filly, now at her best, defeated Incanta
tion and 'Schulamite, at even weights,
thus showing an improvement of some
ten pounds at least in her form. Early
in the race, Hildebrand, Schulamite's
Jockey, had,, according to the patrol
Judge, Interfered with Incantation, who
appeared to be squeezed back. For his
reckless riding Hildebrand was fined
J^OO and suspended for two days. The
Astoria Stake was worth $7,750 to the
winner, whtch Is the daughter of Golden
Garter and Aurania, the last named
being once well known when the prop
erty of the Messrs. Dwyer.
â¢ Concern was expressed when it was
seen that Short Hose, favorite for the
second race, was "sore" and his pre
liminary was so poor that the second
choice, Conqueror, was heavily played
to beat him while Joe Yeager in his
book took all the money offered on
Short Hose. He was right as to the
latter, but did not pick the winner,
which proved to be W. C. Daly's Him
self.

President Roosevelt, by proxy, won
the silver cup on the target of honor.
It is customary at the opening of each
fest for the first three shots to be fired
by the president of the bund on behalf
of the President of th^ United States.
To-day Henry Kroeger scored 67 oo be
half of President Roosevelt and this
proved high score. The President was
notified of the event and the silver cup
was sent to him.
NEW YORK, June 13.â The Fourth
National Bund Shooting Festival of
America opened to-day at Union Hill
Park, Hoboken. There was a large
attendance of expert German marks
men, including sixteen crack shots
from California. These representatives
of the Pacific Coast made fine records
on the first day, the following San
Franciscans gold medals: A.
Strecker, Max Kolander, Captain F. A.
Kuhls. William F. Blasse, F. W.
Blasse and M. Reubold. It Js prob
able that some of the big prizes of the
festival will go to California.
. The grand -parade of riflemen, which
is one of the principal features of the
fourth annual shooting festival now
being held in Hoboken, took place to
day. The parade was held in New
York. The men were reviewed by
Mayor McCIellan, the German Consul
and his staff and a hundred other dig
nitaries from this city, New Jersey and
other States, some coming from Cali
fornia to participate in the review and
parade. There were nine, divisions un
der the leadership of Captain Lewis
Wennell.
Many of the directors have been op
posed to professional boxing contests
in the club, but they have tolerated
them because they felt that the organ
ization needed the money. Those who
â¢will deride the question are President
R. M. Fitzgerald. Paul J. Schafer. Phil
H. Rosenheim, P. J. Cadagan. Fclton
Taylor. G. R. Lukens and Walker B.
Fawcett.
The directors have received assur
ance that as soon as the professional
fights are abolished more than enough
money to meet the deficit will be sub
scribed by those interested in the club.
The promoters of the new plan pro
pose to substitute amateur boxing con
tests for the open professional. These
xrill be for members only. No admis
sion fee will be charged. If the club
members should ever desire a profes
sional contest between top notchcrs
the maXch would also be for member?
only and therefore the public would be
Â«>xcJuded as in amateur events.
The proposed change is expected to
Â¦win the approval of the directorate. In
lact, it is said a majority of the di
rectors have signified their desire to
end the professional exhibitions as soon
bs financial considerations permit-
The revenue from them has been or
vise to the club In Its straitened cir
cumstances, but the crisis has been
passed and the dub Is on its feet more
strongly than It has been for several
years.
The proposal to abandon professional
boxing contests as revenue producing
entertainments â¢will be the subject of a
special meeting of the board of direct
ors of the Reliance Athletic Club called
Jor Friday night. It is proposed not
only to stop the professional fights, but
to limit the attendance at any future
contests to members only.

CHICAGO, June 13.â Kurtzmann, the
stable companion to the Derby fav
orite, English Lad, won the Graduate
stakes, the feature event of the Har
lem card to-day. Gold Enamel was
second, a head in front of Pinkerton.
The stake had a gross value of $3240.
of which J2790 went to the winner.
Kurtzmann was always favorite, back
ed from 6 to 5 to 9 to 10. Pinkerton
and Kurtzmann ran neck and neck for
half a mile. Schrelber's colt was first
to quit and Kurtzmann went on and
won handily.
Gold Enamel came from nowhere in
the stretch with a desperate rush and
was only beaten half a length at the
wire.. He got up just in time to beat
out Pinkerton by a head for the place.
Out of a field of five in the jumping
race, only two finished, which is tlie
second time this unusual feature has
occurred at this meeting. Leo Planter
and John E. Owens were the only two
to stand up and they finished as
named. Despite his two straight vic
tories, both in easy fashion, Leo
Planter was at long odds of 23 to 5,
backed from 3 to 1. A mild killing
was made on the victory of Sea Voy
age in the opening event. From 7 to 5
to 1 she was played by a wise few
and under an excellent ride by "Big
Bill". Knapp, lasted long enough to
win by half a length after a drive
through the stretch with Luretta. The
track was fast, weather clear and
warm and a large Monday crowd was
in attendance. Seven races were run
to-day for the first time this season.

The United States Circuit Court of

adjourned until to-morrow without
transacting any business, owing to the
absence of Judge Gilbert, who Is try-
Ing the Spring Valley water case.
Selects the Ocean Beach as the Place
in Which to Lie Down
and Die.
The body of an unidentified man,
poorly dressed, was j found yesterday
morning on the ocean beach near the
life-savins station. A bottle which
had contained carbolic acid and a
tumbler lay by his side. The label
had been scratched off. In the pock
ets of the clothing were found an old
penknife, a bunch of keys and the
menu for June j5 of the I>el Paso sa
loon. The keys were of Corbin make,
two beinitr cabinet or desk keys and
the third a door key. On one of the
small keys was the number 482.266
and on the other the name M. J. Ken
nedy or Kenny. He was about six
feet tall and weighed about 190
pounds. One of the upper teeth on
the right side was capped with gold.
He was about 30 years of age. with
dark hair, light eyebrows.' long nose,
a pointed chin and light blue eyes.

With such frequency did t<V-Â» and
cthÂ»r portable property disappear from
the cellar cf H. J. Prien's residence,
1253 California street, that the family
at last decided to put a stop to the pU
textas. A contrivance was installed
that rang a bell in Mr. Prien's bedroom
vhen any cce entered either the door

bus guarded the head cf the household

nests. For a week his slumber was
:n disturbed by the bell, but about >

ix<ssÂ«?ss:on were found six skeleton keys
*a-3 other evidence that he was a regu
lar practitioner.
In the court cf Judge Mogan yester
day Miller confessed that he had com
mitted the prior robberies of the Prien
i ellar. TÂ»o weeks ago he stole a lot
Â¦ f tools and sold them to a Chinese
â¢link dealer. He^jvas ordered to reap
; ear this morning, when he will be held

Charles Burrier notified the police by
â¢flephcn* Saturday night that Edward
Kf-yt was running amuck with a pistol
at S15 Jessie street and had fired two
I istel shots at him with murderous In-
Ttnt. A cour-le of active ar.d fearless
1 atrolmen hastened cut and arrested
Keyt after ascertaining that there wa^
virtue in Burrier's complaint. When
the case came up in Judge Fritz's court,
however, Burrier declined to testify for
the jrcsecution, and in order to give
him time to change his mind once more
i. continuance for a week was ordered.
Kate Leddy. gray-haired and deeply
v-rinkled. laughed derisively at the
v,itcesses who testified she had been
ciakiny a specialty of window-smash
ing on Howard street, near Sixth.
"You know why I broke your win
dows, don't ycru. eh?" she shouted at
me modest householder who had Just
*aid Ms loss at her hands consisted of
f- ur large panes. "I broke 'em." she
â¢ ontinued. ere he could reply to h^r
Â«;uery, "b<?cause you have a curtain
house. Oh. you may fool the other
neighbors, but you can't fool me. I
know how you murdered the sunny
southerners from Houston, and how
you g^t away with Mr. Smith.""
As the woman seemed to be demented
Judpe Megan continued the case for

.Earl E. Waterman. houÂ«emover. re-
Fidir.g at 2211 J street, celebrated his
dismissal from the charge of wife-beat-
IeR by getting drunk arid repeating that
offense. His wife had him rearrested
and declares now the will prosecute
him to the bitter end. It was through
her intercession that Zxiize Mogan dis
charged him with a reprimand the last

Mrs. Stephen Potter cf 6*2 Second
direct. accrÂ«mpanied by her two yctng
Â«=>r sisters. last Friday evening visited
ber husband, from whom she is separ
ated, at his apartment !n the Elniore
House. Sixth and Harrison streets, and
remanded that he give her money to
MUTfTt their three-year-old child. The
result of the visit wa* his arrest for
battery, on her complaint, and the
r< suit of the arrest was his dismissal
by Judge Mogan. Mrs. Potter testified
that he assaulted her without provoca
tion. He testified that she was drunk
and disorderly. There was no testi
mony to substantiate her side cf the i
*tory, while his narrative was corrobo
rated by the landlord of the house.
Then the woman accused defendant of J
rains' t<~to friendly with her nineteen- j
: -ar-oM married sister, and the Judge j
suggested ehe might make a separate :
Â¦~^~ iplaint on that score. She promised
to da so.
Eva Mitt he II. nineteen year^ of age.
an<i residing at "33 Clementina street.
â¢ pined that her arrest for loitering on
E Oh street, near Mission, at Z o'clock
!2Â«t Sunday raorair.g. was very little
short of an outrage, and she would like
d have Policeman Kruger severely
reprimanded. ,
"Other girls can go around the sa-
loons unmolested." said Miss Mitchell,
'and I'd like to know why I ain't let
alone. That policeman must take me
for a fooL"
"And why shouldn't he?" inquired
Judge Mogan. "What else but a fool
could any sensible man pronounce a
young girl who deliberately places her
self in a position to lose the respect
of good people? What's your occupa
tion?"
"I'm a housemaid." with diminished
defiance.
"Then I suppose you desire to be re
garded as a good girl, and would be
very angry if any one hinted to the
contrary. Now, if you are not a fool,
you must realize that you cannot re
tain the reputation of a good girl, stay-
Ing out late at night and associating
with people who do the same thing.
The policeman arrested you on the
mute that leads to degradation. I'll
continue your case two weeks, and if
you're not a fool you will by that time
have a different idea of what consti
tutes foolishness."
Miss Mitchell left the courtroom un
der escort of her employer, a respect
able-looking matron.
It was Howard Truax's eighteenth
birthday, and with two lads of about
similar age. George Harcourt and
William Patterson, he was celebrating
the occasion by singing with loud voice
in a vacant lot at Twenty-ninth and
Mission streets, the hour being mid
night. The vocalism attracted the at
tention of Patrolmen Gallagher and
Manning on their lonely beat half a
mile away, and when they hastened to
where the singers stood they found the
neighbors rising in indignant protest.
Alter advising Master Truax to cele
brate his nineteenth natal day far
away from the madding crowd, and at
a more seasonable hour, Judge Mogan
dismissed the cases.
Old Man Gunderson of 120 Erie street
had his son Melvin arrested for va
grancy, but Mamma Gunderson and
Miss Gunderson testified that th? de
fendant was the mainstay of the house
hold, while the complainant had not
worked or contributed to the family
maintenance since last September and
was addicted to drink. The charge was
dismissed and the father sharply cen
sured by Judge Mogan.
Robert Powell, a colored trooper from
the Presidio, denied that He had 'used
a bolo in his encounter witii Wlllimn
Turner, a colored civilian, last Satur
day afternoon at the residence of Miss
Helen Morse, a colored laundress, at
23C0 Green street. It was averred, fur
ther, by Private Poweli that in the con
vict kis head had repeatedly been
struck with a metal 'knuckle duster'
wielded by Mr. Turner. "Though." he
added, "de blows didn't faze me."
Mr. Turner's head was neatly en
veloped in bandages, and a surgeon's
certificate stated that it had been deep
ly cut by some sharp instrument that
might have been a bolo.
"Ah knows wot a bolo am," said
Private Powell, "lease Ise bin In de
Phillumpeens an' saw de weppics in de
hans ob de niggahs. But all didn't use
no bolo on dis yah pen'lem'n'a haid.
No, sah; yo' jes' b'lieve dat."
Judge Mogan is weighing the evi
dence.
Albert Rlnaldo cf 514 Green street,
armed with a lorg knife, was chasing
Charles Torre of 1S21 Duoont street
when Officers Davis and Isaacs start
ed to pursue the pursuer. Rinaldo then
ran to his home, and while search
ing for him there the policemen found
Tomaw Maring concealed under a bed
and also arrped with a knife. *Rinaldo
and Manns will be. tried before Judge
Fritx to -morrow.

James Jaokson (colored) Is accused
by James Brenzinski, a fifteen-year-old
lad. of having stolen a bicycle, and
Judge Mogan will hear testimony in
the case to-day. The defendant ap
peared in a sky-blue sweater and
proudly informed the court that he
owns two other garments of the same
shape and texture, but different hue,
oiiS of them being pink and the other

Mrs. Rose Hendrix. wife of a China
town watchman, was returning to her
home, 1232 Sacramento street, when
she saw Harry C. House lying drunk
and inanimate alongside the curb.
Near him lay a pocket-book, which she
indiscreetly picked up and was holding
in her hand when Policeman VT. W.
Lambert arrived on the scene and ar
rested her for larceny. She convinced
Judge Cabaciss that it was feminine
curiosity instead of larcenous Intent
that prompted her to pick up the purse,
and he discharged her.
Simply because the landlord of the
Cummins House, â¬18 Post street, ob
jected *o the boisterous conduct of
Fllmer E. Lansing last Sunday morning
that cerson drew a revolver and fired
two shots, neither of which resulted
in injury to any Qne but himself. He
was arrested for disturbance of* the
peace and will be tried next Thursday
before Judge Mo-ran.
Thomas O. Parry, who resides on
Fifth street, between Mission and
Howard, "was arrested on complaint of
his wife for battery and disturbing
the peace, but when the case was
called by Jud^e Fritz there was no ap
pearance for the prosecution. The
battery charge was dismissed and the
accusation cf peace disturbance will be
tabard next Monday. The arresting po
liceman said Parry had smashed much
household furniture before he smashed
his better ha'f.
Harry- SingT. who. on pretense of
*elline txy>k.Â«. cttair.ed admittance to
dwellings ar.d stole Jewelry, was held
by Judge Mogan to answer three
charges of burglary to the Superior
Court, with bail ffxed at $5000.
John Clancy, the cocaine fiend who
as found concealed in the home of
the Paulist Fathers at California and
Dupont streets, and who pave a pursu
ing policeman a Ion* and lively race,
was sentenced to three months' Im
prisonment for disturbing the peace.
Father Stark declined to swear to the
complaint of burplary. as it was ap

Judge Fritz prescribed six months In

manfl?*! Patrolman T. Conlan to throw
up his hands while that officer was

Instead of obeying 1 the command Ton-

O'ou to be full Judge.)
I 00 hereby solemnly agree and guarantee to
make no charge if I fall to tell your name, oc-
cupation and what you called for; I tell you if
husband, wife or lover Is true or false: who and
when you will marry; how to gain the love of

every hope, fear or ambition better than you
can tell yourself; his advice is reliable; his

the highest possible development in mental
visor, health., happiness and capacity to earn

FROM ALL SECTIONS THEY COME TO
WITNESS THE WONDERFUL DEMON-
STRATIONS of the NOTED LIVINGSTONE.
For a reliable and intelligent clairvoyant
reading go to LIVINGSTONE, 428 Eddy st.
He askB you no questions, but tells you
what you wish to know.
He does not mention all the Ills and mis-
fortunes you are he!- to. You are acquainted
with the facts in your case. Let PROFESSOR
LIVINGSTONE analyze the matters that are
troubling you, flnd the cause of trouble and
sutTECst the. remedy.
He Is as conspicuous for his wonderful oc-
cult analysis as he Is for his original ex-
pression and vivid truthfulness.
Would it not be a relief to know how you
will Â¦ succeed, to be relieved of the matters that
are troubling you and of the schemes of your
enemies, that you may meet with better success?
A test reading Is not- a life reading. When
you call on PROF. LIVINGSTONE he will
elve you a full life reading for $1. A test
Is of little value; when the mind Is troubled
you need more substantial aid and advice.

The Oceanic Steamship Company's liner
Marlposa will carry a large number of pas
sengers for Tahiti when she. leaves hers July
2 on her next trip. The Island of Papeete, of
which Tahiti Is the capital, belongs to France,
and July 14 natives and French officials will
celebrate the fall of the BaMlle on a large
scale. This will be the first time since the
establishment of the steamship lln<Â» between
here and Tahiti that the Maripota's stay at
the South Sea port has coincided with the
French celebration and many people from all
over the United States are going to take ad
vantage of the coincidence. This celebration
Is always a great occasion for the natives and
the visitor at that time will see the South Sea
aborigine in all his primeval Individuality.
Natives from the Islands of the Pomotu group
will participate In the festivities. One. feature
will be a big water carnival In which a huge
navy of ancient and modern canoes will | par
ticipate. Side by side with the newest and
most gorgeous canoe of some up-to-date dusky
dandy will float the war canoe of a hundred
years ago, and with them will be every type
of canoe used by the Islanders for several gen
erations On shore there will be weird native
ceremonies of a character that will Interest the
student of Island life.
More than fifty people have hooked passages
on the Marlposa which on this trip will carry
an orchestra. The Marlposa will reach Ta
hiti July Vi, the day before the celebration.

was likewise prices were easier. Old Potatoes
continued dull, with prices largely nominal.
The -steamer added 31(i2 sacks to the stock of

NEW YORK, June 13.â The flattering specu
lative upward movement In prices was a sore
disappointment to-day t<ythe professional trad
ing element. The rise* which developed In
th< ; latter part of last week had arooaÂ«d great
hopes that the market was at last stirred out
of Its rut. The presumption was widespread
that the advance in prices had received coun
tenance and assistance from some of the large
banking and railroad interests.- whose co
operation In the market has been vainly looked
for by the traders for many weeks j>a*t. There
was no evidence to-day of buying of this
character and when the smaller class of specu
lators attempted to take profits on some of
the holding* tak*n over last week they found
they had the market to themselves and no '
absorptive power for their moderate offerings.
The reasons which the habitual traders ex
pect always to be present for a movement of
jcices were variously assigned. Probably the
true explanation would he that supi>osltions as
to the Influential character of lam week's buy
ing were mistaken. The opening advance was
promptly quelled by the heaviness of United
States Steel preferred and unfavorable con
clusions were drawn from the personality of
the brokers employed in that stock, who : were
supposed to be informed on trade affairs. The
weekly discussion of railroad traffic by officials
was decidedly pessimistic and served to upset
the calculations that better traffic conditions
for the railroads would result from the better
conditions of last week- On the contrary,
railroad officials were, rather generally agreed
in the opinion that the merchandise movement
over their lines was markedly smaller than last
year and that merchants and manufacturers
were still persisting In their conservative hand
to-mouth methods ot buying. Accumulation"
of empty care was an item of many of these '
weekly Interviews. The discussion bears â¢ on
tne traffic of last week, but It anticipates re
ports of gross earnings to appear in regular
ccuri-e in the future and whose influence will
then have to be reckoned with. The resump
tion on a small scale of recently suspended
traffic on the lakes is an influence in dim
inishing tbe traffic of railroads, to which It
was diverted during the effective period of tbe
lake tie op. The domestic exports for May
make a poor contrast with the relative Im
rrovement In April, which It was hoped marked
the turn for the better In our export trade.
May exports of domestic products, on the con
trary have decreased over $15,000,000 from
those of May last year, and upward of $18,
000.000 from April of this year. In the de
creaÂ»e from last year more than $11,000,000
is In value of breadstuffs and over $3,000,000
In value of cotton. The $Â».734,801 Â¦ of the
brradstufTs exports makes the lowest valua
tion of npx one month for years past. The
c 4 vance. in the grain markets to-day helped
to unsettle the stock market, as did a reduc
tion In the price of copper. The circular to
ktockbolders of - the Northern Securities Com
pany renewed attention to tbe tying up of
the dividend* on the $S35.000,000 cfÂ» stock
in that corporation. The markets closed heavy,
at the lowest of the day. . . .
There was a good demand fnr bonds and
prices were firm. Total rales, par value, $1,
b.'5,000. "Â»1 ; "'

CHICAGO June 13. â Sentiment In the
wheat pit to-day waa bearish during the early
part of the session. Opening quotations on
July were down }ic to V4c at 85%c to Â«5Â»/4c.
Lower cables and improved weather conditions
were elements in the situation that tended to
depress prices, but perhaps the greatest factor
was the report of the world's shipments for
the past week. While the total was about
as expected, exports from America showed a
decided decrease. Pit traders were Inclined to
consider* the figures strongly Indicative of the
present European Indifference to American
wheat. Many bearish crop advices were re
ceived early In the day. One report, in com
menting on tbe condition* of spring wheat In
the Canadian Northwest said prospects could
not be more favorable. Toward the middle
of the day sentiment suddenly became bullish
ir.icl prlci-s started upward. Sentiment In. corn
and oats was largely responsible for the change
of tone. Home bullish crop reports were re
ceived from Kansaa and Oklahoma telling of
flooded conditions and predicting a late har
vest. . Shorts were active purchasers during
the last hour of the ncselon. the market con
tinuing stronj until the close. After advanc
ing to SGH@8<J%c July closed at S(JHÂ®Sti%c.
The Htrength manifested In corn was rather
surprising. In view of the moderate volume
of trade. The market closed well toward the
top. July opened 1^'8 1 ic higher at 4SHc to
4Sftc, eold up to 4ii '-ic and closed at *'JV*tP
There wag a big general commission house
trade In oats, with the demand largely cen
tered In the September delivery, although there
was also an increased demand for December.
After opening unchanged to He higher at 3O'Â£c
to 30%c July ranged between .T.'\c and 3H%e,
closing at 30*ift.'ilÂ»%c.
Provisions were strong on covering' by Bhorts
under the leadership of prominent packing In
terests. Light receipts of hogs, higher prices
at the yards and strength of corn helped along
the advance. At the close September pork
was up l.YuKi.jr. September lard showed an
advance of 10c and ribs were up 15c.

Receipts of Strawberries were lighter than,
usual and there was a good demand for choice
stock, but prices ranged lower, as the bulk of
the receipts were soft and sunburnt as a result
of the recent hot weather. There werÂ« only
seventeen chests of the Longworth variety re-<
celved and the top quotation was obtained only
for a few odd lots, $8 being about the top for
the general run of offerings. Gooseberries, too
showed the effects of the hot weather and
prices had y a wider range. Other kinds of
Berries wr.re in small supply and steady. Re
ceipts of Cherries were light and looee stock
cleaned up well at firmer prices. Canners and
distillers were buying Royal Annes, the former
paying Be and the latter 5%c per pound. De
ciduous fruits, particularly Apricots, were in
increased supply and prices had a downward
tendency, with large lines of Apricots still un
sold at the close. Figs arrived rather freely
from several sections and eold at $1 50^2 SO
per box. Seedless Grapes were weak at $1 25Â®
1 50 per crate and prices or Cantaloupe* in

Trade in Citrus fruits was moderately active.
Oranges being the firmest description. Mexican
Limes were in Increased supply and lower. The

Receipts of Butter and Eggs fell oft sharply
yesterday, as will be seen, and were the
smallest for a long time. The Butter market
was not affected thereby, as the decrease was
largely due to the delay In the arrival of the
Humboldt steamer. Some of the arrivals were
soft, owrhy to Ia3t week's hot .wave, but most
of the stock was In good condition. The mar
ket was utili reported dull. .
The situation In Cheese remained unchanged.
Eggs were likewise unaffected by the falling
off in receipts, and dealers quoted the same
prices that ruled at the close of the week.
The retailers are not disposed to pay top quo
tations if they can help it. as they are looking
for stock that they can retail for 25c. Th%
market Is slow, as usual at this time of the
year.
Receipts were 32,200 lbs Butter. 439 caaet

John E. Wendt, who formerly con
ducted a coffee-house on Sacramento
street, was put on the stand, but his
memory was so poor that his testimony
ni practically valuelees. The prosecu
tion wished to connect him with the
disappearance of the books from the
Pacific Coast Warehouse, but "I can't
remember" was the response to the
majority of the questions. He did re
member receiving a shipping receipt,
but could not fix even the year, to say
nothing of the day or month. The case
will be continued this morning.
Henry C. Bunker, grain tester for the
Merchants' Exchange, occupied the
6tand nearly all of yesterday in the
criminal proceedings against Jacob Ep
pinger. charged with obtaining money
from the International Banking Cor
poration on worthless warehouse re
ceipts. The cross-examination of Bun
ker by Attorney Ach for the defense
further opened the way for the defense
to show that little attention was paid
to lot numbers at the warehouse, equal
Quantity and quality being the chief (
consideration. Â¦**""
Wh$n Attorney Ach asked if it was
customary to disregard the lot number
called tor In the grain receipt and to
â¢supply an equal quantity of the same
quality of grain. Attorney Campbell
and District Attorney Byington raised
strong objections, Campbell quoting
Statutes to prove that such action
Trould be a felony. The objection was
overruled and Ach continued:
"Have you ever heard of such substi
tutions being made?"
"Yes."
"By the firm of Cutter & Moseley?"
"Yes."
The witness further said that, by
agreement of both parties, lota of wheat
were frequently exchanged for option i
lots, the quality of the grain being con
sidered rather than the numbers on the
warehouse receipts. He had visited the
Twarehouse at Crockett on July 2 of last
year, but was refused admittance. He
knew nothing of the shifting of grain
piles in the Â¦warehouse, the stenciling
of sacks or the loading of piles of grain
on barges except what he _ bad read In
the newspapers.
Most of the afternoon session was
taken up by the defense In questioning
the witness as to his knowledge of
weevils and how much "weeviled"
wheat was in the warehouse at the time
of the failure of Eppinger & Co. The
object of this questioning was to show
that at the time the firm went to the
Â¦wail there was enough good wheat In
the Â¦warehouse to satisfy the claim of
the complainants, although it did not
bear the specific lot numbers called for
in the warehouse receipts. It was fur
ther ! shown to be customary when
wheat became weeviled to subject it to
a hot blast treatment for the removal
of the insects, after which It would
again rank as No. 1 wheat.
The tables will be spread to accom
modate 700 guests. The feast will be
served in the art room, on the second
floor of the Pavilion. Precisely at 7
o'clock the festivities will begin. No
hour Is fixed for the conclusion, but as
Mr. Ruef is due to leave San Francisco
at 11 o'clock the following day the time
can be approximated.
The banqueters are not expected to
appear In swell evening dressâ In fact,
the ordinary every-evening tuxedo is
not demanded. Mr. Ruef's invitation is
engraved on a silver plate with gorge
ous filigree. A , special carriage will
convey George Boyne and Tom Atkin
son and the silver-plated invitation to
Mr. Ruef's residence, and In the
wheeled conveyance the chief guest of
the evening will be escorted to the ban
quet hall. Never has Mr. Ruef been
outside of v the State of California.
Hence his departure for the far away
country east , of. the Sierras and the
Rockies is to be made an event. The
banqueters and others will meet on Un
ion square, near the St. Francis, Hotel,
at 10 o'clock to-morrow to escort Mr.
Ruef to the ferry on the . occasion of
the first real: outing of his life. Mayor
Schmitz, .Herbert Schmitz and Frank

PASSENGERS ON SPECIAIi.
"I' was in 111 health when elected a delegate
and came to San Diego a week ago for the
purposo of resting and recuperating. My jour
ney down convinced me that I would certainly
jeopardize my health by. taking the trip to
Chicago at this time. I therefore decided not
to attend the national convention."
Mr. Spreckels feels and expresses keen re
gret at not being able to attend the convention.
His health has improved very materially since
coming here, but he does not feel strong
enough to make the Journey. In bis colleagues
on the delegation he has the utmost confidence
and feels that the party will be well repre
sented in the convention.
SAN DIEGO, June 13.â John T>. Spreckels.
who waa elected one of the delegates at large
to the National Republican Convention, which
assembles at Chicago on June '-1, to-day
wired Secretary. Steppacher to cancel his hotel
and railway . reservations, as he would be un
able to be present at the convention owing to
ill health. Mr. Spreckels in referring to thlr
action said:
Later in the day the foregoing waa
supplemented by this message from
The Call special correspondent in San
Diego:
The California delegation to the Na
tional Republican Convention will leave
San Francisco for Chicago at 11 a. m.
to-morrow on a superb special train.
John D. Spreckels, one of the four
delegates at large, will not be able to
attend the convention. He had made
all preparations to accompany the dele
gation, having paid his assessment, re
served a drawing-room on the special
train and apartments at the Audito
rium In Chicago. Yesterday he. wired
the following message to the secretary
of the delegation:
"CORONA-DO, Cal., June \ 13,-Jacob
Steppacher, Secretary Republican State
Committee, Palace Hotel. San Francis
co: Owing to illness am unable to ac
company delegation. Please cancel
hotel and railroad reservations.
"JOHN D. SPRECKELS."
REASONS FOR ABSENCE.
In response City Attorney Long read
from decisions to show that the court
had jurisdiction and that the board
had acted within Its powers. He said
the city denied the right of the com
pany to secure a greater revenue than
would be forthcoming at the rates al
lowed. The case will be further argued
this morning.
Continuing his argument at the af
ternoon session, Kellogg said that he
stood aghast at the effrontery shown
â¢n claiming the Board of Supervisors
were not subject to review. He thought
it was simply an attempt to take the
company's property without due pro
cess of law.
Kellogg argued that the 'court had
full jurisdiction and cited many cases
to sustain the contention. He claimed
that the city had wholly failed to an
swer the complaint and that, in fact,
the answer filed by the city was an
admission of every allegation in the
bill. He contended that the affidavits
filed by the city were mere denials in
general of the points raised by the
plaintiff and did not controvert any of
the causes of action. Hearsay was the
bulk of the matter submitted by the
city.
The company's attorney further said
that the company would put up an
ample bond to return the money paid
under the present rate, if the court
would issue the restraining order pray
ed for and later on the Superior Court
should decide against his client. In
that~ way the citizens would lose noth
ing, but the company would be the
sole sufferer. He asked the court to
take these matters into consideration.
THE CITY'S "EFFRONTERY."
Stating that he intended to reverse
the ordinary mode of procedure in
practice, he presented the law points
in advance of the status of the case,
as the court was thoroughly conver
sant with the matter from the nature
of the affidavits filed.
The case came up yesterday morn
ing, when Assistant City Attorney
Partridge presented three additional
affidavits in answer to the claims ad
vanced by the company in its applica
tion for an injunction to restrain the
city from putting into effect the water
rates passed by the Board of Super
visors to take effect July 1.
Attorney Kellogg for the company
said there were two "impositions" to
be considered. The first was: Are the
facts complained of true or satisfactor
ily proved? The.second was incidental.
He questioned whether the relief
sought by the company might not be
secured by the final decree.
REVERSES PROCEDURE.
That the Board of Supervisors is try
ing to put the Spring Valley Water
Company out of business and that the
board is not trying to do anything of
the kind are the two points being
argued before United States Circuit
Judge, Gilbert.
To-day the capitalist believes that the pres
ent economic system is right, that he is getting
only his share of the wealth created, and. eo
believing is seeking to extend his power and
fortify himself in his position.
The wage-earner believes that he is not get
ting hiÂ« share of the wealth, and eo believing,
is making every effort to secure more. He is
possessed with a longing for power, for con
sideration for material improvement and so
cial equality.
There is the devil of despair, who claims his
8000 suicides a year; the devil of idleness, with
his 80,000 tramps, "can't works," who have
become hardened into "won"t works": the
devil of poverty, whose long arm Is continu
ally reaching out after new victims. Consid
ering our enormous wealth, there never was a
time when there was so much withering,
blighting stunting, damning poverty as there
is to-day. "The devil of disease stalk*
through our unsanitary mills and mines and
factories, our tenement houses, reeking with
filth, where human beings are huddled to
gether like cattle, thousands of whom he
claims as his legitimate prey.
It is suggestive of the fate that overtakes
the defeated In the economic struggle, the
unfit, the unfortunate, all who fall by the
wayside. What one sees In a glance at the
rear of our industrial army is enough to make
the heart tick.
The principle of competition finds expression
In the oft-quoted phrase, "Every man for him
self and the devil take the hindmost." I
There is little wonder that 25,000 farmers in
1902 and 40.000 In 1903 found their way over
the Northwest border Into Canada, and that
the exodus for 1904 bids fair to far surpass
these figures.
The best statistical authorities that we have
produce an overwhelming conviction that rela
tively the masses do not get anything like their
share of the wealth they produce.
DAMNING POVERTY EXISTS.
The farmer so far from making headway is
being divorced from the soil and pushed back
Into a medieval tenantry. In 18S0 25 per cent
of the farmers of the United States were ten
ants. To-day 35 per cent are tenants. The
farmer Is ground between the upper and nether
millstones of the railroad company on the one
band and the commission merchant or buyer
on the other hand. Â¦ â¢
But a closp examination of the alleged Im
provements in the condition of wage-earners
in more recent years leaves one at a loss to
account for the widespread misconceptions.
Local conditions among California wage
earners are exceptional and are of course not
to be taken as a criterion for a general esti
mate, but on the other hand nowhere in the
United States Is the coet of living higher than
In California.
EXODUS OF FARMERS.
There is a popular impression abroad that
the condition of the wage-earner has greatly
Improved of recent years. The belief will not
bear analysis.
Without doubt wages have advanced during
the last half century.
Too many of our money magnates are
fittingly compared to the famous Corsican, Na
poleon, the "colossal highwayman of history-"
Their moral and social irresponsibility is as
flagrant, their predatory Instincts are as In
satiable, their egotism is as unbounded, their
defiance of law and moral principles as ruth
less as that of their great military prototype.
During each session of Congress an army
of lobbyist!, the best legal talent of America,
lays siege to our nation's capital.
If any one supposes they are there to aecure
the passage of jUEt laws, to aid our law
makers in their effort -to act with an eye
single to the interests of the people, a study
of the Congressional Records for the last ten
years will suffix for a complete disillusioning.
Not only does corporate wealth seek to con
trol our legislative bodies and our Judiciary,
but it has come to believe Itself entitled to
special privileges at the White House.
President Roosevelt was taken to task by a
number of visiting New York magnates fur
not first consulting them before instituting
legal proceedings against the Northern Securi
ties Company.
No living American can do otherwise than
believe in the honesty of purpose of President
Roosevelt, but the law of environment operates
on Presidents as well as other men, and It
must be confessed that the atmosphere of
Washington Is not at present conducive to
clearness of vision. .
The first condition in the Industrial world
is the concentration of wealth, the second con
dition Is the consolidation of wealth and the
third condition is the control which corpora
tions and wealth seek to exercise over our
Government. Concentration, consolidation,
control â that Is the order.
"The Relations Between Capital and
Labor" was the subject discussed by
J. H. Kimball yesterday before the
regular weekly meeting of the Congre
gational Ministers' Association. The
Kev. Dr. Rader presided, and there was
a large attendance.
Mr. Kimball said, in part:
"Divorce is too light a punishment
for offenders against the marriage tie.
The most serious offenses j ought to
meet imprisonment" for life. It. is not
laxity for which I plead, 1 but the right
to teach not -some outrageous rule
that Jesus never gave, but that wh^ch
the situation justifies."
"Instead of settling the divorce ques
tion," said the preacher, "Jesus left
the whole subject open. Ministers are'
not compelled to say that all persons
divorced for anything but the 'one
cause' shall not marry again. They
are free to teach What obvious justice
and humanity require and not a harsh
law that Jesus never gave. If, for ex
ample, a woman refuses to live with a
man who makes himself a drunken
brute and gets a divorce from him and
later marries a decent man, no
preacher is bound to denounce such
marriage.
CHICAGO, June 13. â In a sermon
on divorce' the Rev. Pearse Pinch de
clared in Forestville Congregational
Church that the attempts on the part
of the stronger ecclesiastical bodies to
whip preachers into line will only re
sult in fresh disaster to the home.
Police Commissioner H. W. Hutton,
"special chief of police for 1129 Dupont
street," has scored the first point In the
fight made for his arrest by Attorney
George D. Collins for instructing Po
licemen George F. Barry and C- E. Fen
nell to arrest Mary Duran. an inmate of
1129 Dupont street, on the night of June
7 after she had left Jean Pon's restau
rant. The arrest of the woman was in
direct violation of the injunction is
sued against the police by Judge Cook.
Police Judge Cabaniss yesterday re
fused to issue a warrant for Hutton's
arrest.
On the morning after the woman s
arrest Barry and Fennell declined to
swear to a complaint charging her with
vagrancy, and she was discharged by
Police Judge Cabaniss. Attorney Col
lins at once applied to Cabaniss for
warrants for the arrest of the two po
licemen and Commissioner Hutton for
false imprisonment, but Cabaniss de
layed issuing tliem from day to day.
as he wanted to look up the law on the
subject and also to warn Hutton to
keep his hands off.
Hutton agreed to submit authorities
to the Judge.. This he did yesterday
morning, and asked that the issuance
of the warrants be delayed till 2
o'clock. This was agreed to, but at 2
o'clock Hutton failed to make his ap
pearance, and the Judge delivered a
lengthy opinion on the . right of the
police to make an arrest for vagrancy.
Judge Cabaniss held that the arrest of
the woman Duran was illegal because
the officers did not have a warrant nor
did they see the woman In the commis
sion of. the offense.
The woman then swore to the com
plaints charging Barry and Fennell
with false imprisonment, but the Judge
declined to allow her to swear to a com
plaint against Hutton, as she did not
know of her own knowledge that Hut
ton had advised the officers to make
the arrest. Attorney Colling said he
was prepared to take the responsibility,
but the Judge was not to be moved
from his resolution.
Collins said he was willing to wait,
as if the two policemen would testify
to the truth they would have to admit
that they received their instructions
from Hutton and Hutton's arrest would
surely follow.
The two officers surrendered them
selves and were released on nominal
ball. When their cases are called in
court this morning a continuance will
be granted for two weeks, as Collins
desires to have the evidence of Captain
Duke, who Is now' on his vacation.
As the result of a premature explo
sion of a blast at Twentieth and Ten
nessee streets yesterday afternoon
Michael Griffin and Andrew Quinn sus
tained injuries from which they died
at the Central Emergency Hospital.
Shortly before 5 o'clock last evening
Griffin and Quinn, in company with
several others, were engaged in fixir,?
a blast at Twentieth and Tennessee
streets. The charge failed to explode,
and Griffin and Quinn pulled the twen
ty-foot pipe containing the dynamite
out of the ground. They stuck it on a
rail, and then occurred a deafening: ex
plosion. Both men were hurled a con
siderable distance, and their legs below
the knees were literally torn to shreds.
Tom Dugan. a fellow laborer, sustained
a fracture of the right, clavicle.
Griffin and Quinn were removed to
the Central Emergency Hospital, where
their legs were amputated below the
knees. Griran died immediately. Quinn
died at 1:30 this morning. Both men
were unmarried. Quinn resided at !KC>
Illinois street and Griffin resided at 1012
Tennessee street.
