ASSIGNMENT OF COMMITTEES.
The same . preparations have been
made by. the Odd Fellows to care for
persons who may be accidentally hurt
during the big gatherings at the Me
chanics' Pavilion during the encamp
ment as were made by the Knights
Templar during the conclave. An
emergency hospital has been estab
lished in the southeast corner of the
gallery, under the supervision of the
Rebekahs. A corps of trained nurses
and. physicians will be in attendance.
The Odd Fellows expect that there
will be a large attendance at the va
rious receptions and concerts and
during the crush it is not unlikely that
some one may be the victim of an ac
cident. . Every effort will be made to
prevent mishaps and none are ex
pected to occur, but the order wishes
to be on the safe side and be prepared
for any emergency.

EMERGENCY HOSPITAL SERVICE.
, Wagon" loads of' , grapes, ' peaches, '
plums '.and all 'manner" of choice fruits
* were discharged Â«it the -side entrance
of Mechanic's* T Fay Won, yesterday aft
ernoon! The committee' of Odd ' Fel
lows on duty at the big building re
marked that "there 'will be enough
good things' to eat for all" and the
watchman nodded his head approv
ingly. -
Up on the main floor of the north
gallery .workmen were arranging the
quarters that have been . assigned to
serve as a camp and were making up
â¢four score of neat cots in the curtained
spaces. A place to sleep and plenty to 1
eat seemed to be the keynote of the
plans of the committees and the carry
ing-out of the preliminaries to furnish
ing both was the special work set
apart for ; those who were detailed to
make ready the pavilion for the thou
sands of' visitors who are expected to
arrive, In the city during the week. .
"The committee on, arrangements has
made use . of many , of the - decorations
that' were placed by the"Knights-Tem
plar. but' on the south side of the main
floor | of Â¦'"the" j pavilion .the - booths ' that
â¢were -used by- tho. Temprar hosts have
been remodeled tosuit the demands of

main entrance,. Is ready to receive vis
itors -and y Is" prepared- to show them
some of the' good things that the yal
â¢ley" can produce. Contra- Costa and
San 'Joaquin have made" the most pro
â¢ gress and It was Contra Costa's fruit
that- was â¢being' hauled 'into the head
quarters^ of the progressive \ county
from the big trucks Â¦ outside.
The 1 gallery ' reception rooms that
w'dre decorated for the Knights Tem
plar'will'not be changed except that
the -ladles of tho Rebekah have ar
ranged J to adorn the â¢ quarters with
flowers ',and evergreens.* Sonoma and
Mendoclno counties will use;, the im

the, last rehearsal occurred, with": no
"member of the chorus missing. ' The
voices Â¦ filled j the great structure and
produced pleasing harmony. - Professor

One of the pleasing surprises of the
afternoon was the presentation toPro

by Mrs. Blanche L. Stnborn, II. D.,
who thanked the pi^fessor for his ar

PREPARE FOR FESTIVAL.
One of the matters for -legislative
consideration is that which- has been
brought to official attention by the Cal
ifornia members of the order. The local
members champion - an ' amendment ' to
the constitution, whichat present rules
that no man either directly, or indirect
ly engaged in the liquor traffic shall be
come a member of the order. The Cali
fornians desire to have ; this modified
so that those whose business is indi
rectly connected with the liquor trafflcj
but who are at present barred from the
order, may join. They argue that there
are many worthy . men in this Stats
who are connected t with i" the business,
both wholesale and retail, who ought to
be allowed to become members If their
moral and social' status place them In
the .same, class with citizens who follow
other callings in Ufa. The amendment
mentioned probably, will' not be accept
ed, but the Callfornians intend to bring
the subject up for. discussion. .
The sessions of â¢ the Sovereign Grand
Lodge will be executive^ Assistant
Grand Secretary Curry will . attend" to
the giving out of news. Many of the
matters to be discussed are for the ears
of members only, and ' are of .no interest
to the genera] public. * All news pertain-;
ing to changes . of officer*, new I amend
ments and general > gorcrnment. of the
order will be prepared '. for .publication
by Mr. Curry.'
â¢ Among the prominent- Odd '. Fellows
who will . attend { the session .' Is A. * L.
Mauk of EIko,^Nev. f - who -has-been
identified * with a number of â¢ lodges â¢ of
California.* Mjy Mauk Is :'a: past' grand
Most prominent .'among those who
have been mentioned* for grand sire to
be named after the .honorary electios of
Mr. Wright are Judge John L. 'Nolan
of Tennessee, .W. L." Kuykendall . * of
Wyoming, E. S. Conway of ' Illinois
and Hill Montagu! of Virginia. Judge
Nolan has led among those who aspired
to become deputy grand sire at the ex
piration of the term of ; Mr. Wright, but
now that it is known that" Mr. Wright
does not seek the office of grand sire
the forecast has been changed some
what. All of the candidates may now
have opportunity to try for both offices,
that of deputy grand sire and grand
sire. Â¦Â¦ ye'.-- >''.--Â¦
The outside districts that will have
no delegates .present at the..session of
the Sovereign Lodge are Mexico, Nor

den, Netherlands, New Zealand, Peru,
South Australia", "Canada, France,
Switzerland. Japan, Tasmania, New

England and Italy.
A matter of vital interest to the Sov
ereign Grand Lodge Is the coming elec
tion of a grand sire to fill the position
that will be vacated at the close of his
ten-year term .by John B. Goodwin. Un
der the rules of the order Deputy Grand
Sire Robert E. Wright should be ele
vated to. the exalted position, but Mr.
Wright has been forced ' to. decline, to
serve on account of ill health. . He has
expressed a desire that he shall not be
considered a candidate^ It Is'probable,
however, that his name will' be. present;
ed to the lodge for honorary election.
After the ballot has . been cast In his
favor he will resign . immediately, . and
the election of his" successor will be the
next order of business.

The late Emperor Frederick gave to
Chancellor Bismarck extensive .forests

Since he, ceased to be Foreign Minis
ter on the retirement of his father in
1890 Prince Herbert Bismarck . -had
taken Dart in public affairs only as a
member of the Reichstag.* His attitude
had . been more of a man not appre
ciated by his sovereign and who was
waiting in the background for an op
portunity to resume his career. \
His delivery as a Parliamentary
speaker improved year, by .year. He al
ways declined to join any political
group, steadfastly; calling himself an
independent. His haughty and impe
rious manner in early life, when he
was of .the fact that he
was the son of the 'most powerful
statesman in Europe, softened in later
life. ., â¢ . .
Prince Bismarck's father trained him
for his successor as Chancellor- of the
German Empire . and advanced him
rapidly in the diplomatic service, until
at the age of 40 ", he -was Minister of
Foreign Affairs, in which. position, he
took part in nearly every important
international transaction. â¢
An incident that nearly, wrecked
Prince Herbert's career and that

bert's elopement with Princess Caro

the head of that distinguished Silesian

sational action instituted by Dr.
George Allen Staples for divorce, filed
her answer and cross petition with
the clerk of the courts yesterday. Dr.
Staples, in his complaint, accused his
wife of cruel and inhuman treatment
and ? alleged that she was a cigarette

noon, smoking cigarettes, she set a
bad example for the children.
Mrs. Staples asserts that she learned
the cigarette habits from her husband.
When they visited fashionable cafes
of Europe on their wedding tour they
observed that most of the women
smoked cigarettes, and at her hus
band's request she acquired the habit.
She alleges that it was customary
thereafter for her husband and her
self to smoke cigarettes in their apart
ments, but claims she did not become
so addicted to the habit that stie
might be. cajled. a cigarette. '.'fiend." .
Mrs. Staples, asks for $50,000 ali
mony, and separate maintenance. She
is a daughter of the late . John T.
Hancock, one of the wealthiest whole
sale grocers of Iowa. Dr. Staples'
father was a millionaire.

TO SMOKE CIGARETTES
Continued From Page 1, Column 7.
The massacre lasted all day. In the
darkness of night the Jews gathered up
the fragments of bodies and buried
them, while the wounded were taken
to the hospitals.
The first information of this massa
cre came to-day in a cable dispatch to
the Jewish Post from its Berlin cor
respondent.
The bodies of those who were riddled
with bullets were left in the street un
til a second mob, carrying knives,
would come along. With their sharp
blades they severed hands, legs and
feet.
A young Jewish woman, who was the
mother of five children, fought desper
ately and pleaded, for her children's
j-ake, that her life be spared. She was
stabbed fifty-eight times and dismem
bered.
The mob fell upon the Jewish quar
ter after sunrise, and wherever it en
countered a Jew it pursued him and
stabbed him in the back or shot him
down, if he was making good his es
cape.
PHILADELPHIA. Sept. 18.â The
crusades against the Jews have pene
trated to Germany, according to infor
mation obtained to-day, which details
occurrences in Germany rivaling the
deeds of the Jew baiters in Russia.
There was a riot at Sasnovitch one
week ago to-day, in which fifty Jews
were murdered in the streets, the
slaughter occurring coincidentally with
the celebration of the Jewish New
Year. More than 100 Jews were wound
ed, some of them mortally, and atroci
ties of the most bloody character were
committed by the rioters. This news
has been suppressed in Germany.
The riots began at sunrise on Sunday
one week ago and continued until the
rioters were exhausted. The bodies of
the victims were dismembered. The
rioters used axes and knives to chop
off Arms and legs, the severed mem
bers being tossed to the dogs in the
streets. In one instance th^arms of a
sexton of a synagogue were twisted
from his body by his assailants. Those
of the wounded who were carried to the
hospitals were maltreated on reaching
the institutions.

had constantly supported the princi

to strike and that it was not the duty
of the Government to intervene, and,
adding that he intended to follow the
same principles while he remains in
power. The Minister continues:
"The painful facts are to be regret

their arms In self defense after being
attacked and wounded, and In another
Instance acted without orders from

Mrs. Beaglehole Is quite well known
throughout California and Nevada. A
few years ago she gained considerable
notoriety by her actions regarding
foundlings. A child she had in her
possession was taken from her in Reno
by California authorities because of
the manner she is alleged to have
treated it.
Lamb came here from Truckee sev
eral months ago, made the acquaint
ance of Mrs. Beaglehole and after
promising to marry her, borrowed
money, from her. To-night, when she
realized that she had been deserted,
she fainted. It is not so much the
money,' she says, as it Is the deception
of Lamb.
RENO, Sept. 18.â C A. Lamb, who
until last week was the proprietor of
the'Nevada Steam Laundry, one of the
largest in Reno, and who was in good
standing in the community, has left
town. He is supposed , to have fled
yesterday, on the eve of his wedding
to Mrs. H. Beaglehole, a well-to-do
widow. With him he took more than
$1000 belonging to the woman. He has
gone east and it is reported a young
lady from Carson City accompanied
him.
CHICAGO, Sept. 18.â "The day is not
far off when antitoxin treatment will be
employed as effectively in curing'scar
let fever as it now is in the cure of
diphtheria." . .."Â¦'Â¦Â¦,"Â¦â¢
This prophecy was made last evening
by Dr. Theodore Escherich,, professor of
diseases of children 1 in the University
Of Vienna, and recognized as an author
ity on the subject. He was addressing
an audience of Chicago physicians and
laymen in' the first of a series of popu
lar science lectures "planned to be given
weekly this autumn and winter. .
Dr. Escherich described the researches
which have been in progress during the
last two years in Vienna to discover a
cure for scarlet fever. Upon the results
of more than 100 experiments with se :
rum taken from inoculated animals
the Austrian scientist baaed his claims
for the antitoxin treatment.
"It is not absolutely proved," he said,
"that a cure has yet been found. The
results of the experiments, however,
have been striking, and It has been
demonstrated beyond' doubt that the
injection of inoculated serum Into scar
let fever patients invariably checks the
progress of. the disease."
In cases where the disease had not
progressed " beyond the second day, Dr.
Escherich declared, the antitoxin treat
ment had been entirely successful. In
some instances the fever had been re
duced within four hours after the in
jection.' â¢
"The beneficial results of the anti
toxin treatment also varied," said Dr.
Escherich, "with the period of the dis
ease at, which the serum was injected.
Those" treated earlier responded more
readily. Out of fifteen cases treated
on the first or second day no deaths re
sulted. Three deaths out of fifteen re
sulted from the fourth-day treatment,
and* eight deaths out of fifteen from
the fifth-day treatment."
Two days later a letter came for
him during his absence. It was from
the prospective stepmother and the
children destroyed it. Their father
learned of this and when he came
home Friday night he told his two lit
tle girls that he was going to kill them
and that they must say their , prayers.
He did not carry out the threat and
when he got to sleep the two girls got
the ax and chopped his head off.
The crime has caused great excite
ment, as the murdered man was
prominent in the community in which
he lived. The two little girls are
pretty and intelligent.
MARLIN. Tex., f Sept. 18. â The mys
tery surrounding the murder of C. S.
Stewart, a farmer living eight miles
south of here, was cleared .to-day by
the confessions of his two little
daughters, aged 11 and 13 years, that
they committed the crime. â¢ â¢:;.â¢,â¢
The body of Stewart was found yes
terday afternoon, the alarm being
given by his daughters. He was lying
on. a cot on the porch of his residence..
The head had been severed from the
body with a sharp ax. The girls
claimed at first that they heard no
noise during the night and that 'they
did not know who killed their father.
Their bloody clothing caused suspicion
to be pointed at them and as a result
of a sharp questioning they confessed.
According to the * story of the little
girls, their father was about to re
marry, their mother being dead. They
objected to him bringing a stepmother
to their home. ,

The property which the Western Pa

The franchises cover a right of way

SALT LAKE CITY, Sept. 18.â The

NEW YORK, Sept. 18.â Back, from
their European cruise and by way of
Meriemshe Bight, where, since their
return, the ships have been engaged in
target work, the four battleships of
the North Atlantic .fleet . reached this
port to-dayâ the Kearsarge, the Ala
bama, the Maine and the Missouri.
The fleet* consists of the most powerful
battleships afloat and withal the most
pretentious armada . which this coun
try, has ever^ent abroad. v The other
two battleships, the Illinois and the
Iowa, are still on the target grounds,
but are expected to arrive Vwithln a
day or ' so.
, The fleet brought the story of a
great cyclone encountered at , sea.
Early on Thursday morning, when the
barometers gave warning of the ap
proaching'storm, the fleet was well
scattered along the south of the island,
the Kearsarge (flagship), the battle
ships Alabama, Texas and Maine and
the gunboat- Scorpion well together,
fhe battleships Iowa and Illinois some
six miles to the eastward.
Along toward early daylight the flag
ship sent wireless messages to the fleet
to get up steam and be ready to move
at a moment's warning.
. The Texas had her steam cutter low
ered and so heavy had been the groan
ing rollers â precursor of a storm â that
it had been found impossible to hoist
it. Captain Swinburne ordered that
life lines be flung to the men in the
boat and through a megaphone they
were ordered to tie the lines about
their bodies and jump. They obeyed
and one after another were hauled on
board, a bit bruised and half drowned.
One of the Missouri's men was swept
overboard from the. forecastle. He was
ordinary seaman Cecil Clay Young.
Life buors were immediately thrown
over, but the man, loaded down by his
oilskins/was unable to reach the buoys,
which were rapidly drifting to leeward.
Young * was a native of Marseilles,
Ohio, where his father lives. A wire
less message announcing his death was
sent by Captain Cowles to the fleet.
The hurricane is described by those
who went through it as the most vio
lent they had â¢ ever encountered. A
mighty sea would smite one of the
heavy battleships and she would dis
appear to. her" funnel tops in spray,
"shake the water out of her eyes," as
one expressed it, and - take - another
plunge. . â¢ .

LONDON. Sept. 19.â The Times' cor
respondent with General Kuroki, in a
dispatch dated Liaoyang, September 7,
at the conclusion of a long account of
the battle there, 6ays:
"General Kuroki's flank movement
failed, owing to the tactics of General
Kuropatkin, who trusted that half of
his army wouia suffice to hold the
Japanese south of the Taitse River.
His forces were fo strongly posted and
he possessed such a secure line of re
treat, that the soundness of the course
adopted must appeal to the tacticians.
In any case it upset the calculations
of the Japanese, who counted upon
comparatively feeble resistance to their
flanking movement.
"There are indications to show that
vhile the Russians contemplated a de
termined effort at check, they feared
throwing down the gauntlet and fight
ing: a pitched battle. They had very
â¢mail reserve supplies at Liaoyang,
trusting to the railway for supplies.
The proof of this is that they left
practically nothing for the Japanese,
who captured sufficient to supply their
army for only one day.
"After the Russian retirement to the
â¢tÂ»t bank of the river their position
presented a scene of carnage unparal
leled in European warfare.
"A remarkable feature of the fight
ing on the flank was the evidence that
th*Â» Japanese proved the value of thin
lines as compared with heavy conti
tental formation. The Russians' lack
cf dash was due to prudence against
Jeopardizing their retirement."
An earlier dispatch describing the
passage of the Tan River by the Jap
anese* on August 23, concludes thus:

CHEFU, Sept. 18.â Lojal students of
the military situation at Port Arthur,
basing their deductions upon recent de
velopments there, " are of the opinion
that another grand assault eit\er is oc
curring at. the present time or is im
minent. â¢ This opinion is )*ased on the
very heavy bombardmer.c of the Rus
sian stronghold that occurred on Sep
tember 16, for sue*, a bombardment
forms the usual prjlude. to an assault;
on the arrival h*:re of Important mes
sengers from I J ort Arthur, at a time
when the running-of the blockade Is ex
tremely per!ioils; on a recent authorita
tive statement that the Japanese siege
works are completed,' and on reports
from Japanese sources that at Port
Dalny an assault was expected to take
place In a few days.
In addition to the foregoing there Is
the common. knowledge that the Japa
nese believe that their continued in
activity increases the resisting power
of tho Russian garrison, and they de
sire to make such period of inactivity
as brief as possible.
Belief That Besiegers Have Begun a
General Assault.
CHEFU. Sept. IS.â Chinese. Russians
and Japanese here all agree that the
Japanese vessels blockading Port Ar
thur are paying particular attention to
Junks, which for months past have
been trying to smuggle dispatches and
supplies Into the fortress, and that
when caught the crews are roughly
treated. The junks generally are sunk
and the men on board taken into Port
Dalny. By. mistake the Japanese sank
a junk that was carrying delicacies to
General Nogi from an admirer, but a
part of the cargo was recovered. Gen
eral Nogi commands the Japanese be
siegers.
Russian civilians who have reached
here from Port Arthur say that canned
corn beef is plentiful there and that the
fresh meat supply consists of twelve
horse3 slaughtered daily. Life in the
town when no bombardment is going
on proceeds much as it did in times
of peace. Church services are held "as
usual in the dismantled church, and the
band follows the former custom of
playing in public twice a week.
All of the Russians here agree that
the Japanese do not occupy any fort on
the inner line of defenses. The forts
which were damaged have been re
paired almost during the comparative
quiet of the last eighteen days. These
Russians do not believe that the Japa
nese will succeed in taking the fortress.
BATTLE MAY NOW BE RAGING.

The same correspondent describing
thrÂ» scenes at Tie Pass notes extraor
dinary animation there. The great con
<ouryo of visitors there and the fact
that theatrical performances and open
air concerts are of dally occurrence
hardly indicate that the town is ex
l"<Ung an immediate attack.
Dispatches from Vladivostok and
Baghallea make no mention of develop
menta there. The citizens of Vladi
vostok scout the idea of a siege, and
many are returning from their country
villas. The long-promised Japanese
operations against Raghalien and Vlad
ivostok, *\ hich were expected to act as
a diversion for General Kuroki's ad
vance, are not yet in sight.
Meanwhile indications increase of the
probability of the Japanese meeting
Tvlth resistance. The Russian forces
at Mukden undoubtedly are very large,
and every day's delay enables the com
mander in chief to perfect his defenses.
A private telegram from Mukden re
ports the arrival there of an immense
train filled with convalescents return
ing to duty. This may be regarded as
po.Â»d evidence of a large concentration
of troops at Mukden.
MUKDEN, Sept. 18.â The armies
having recovered from the effects of
the recent fighting before Liaoyang,
Â«.n early development of the situation
may be expected. A mysterious move
ment eastward is on foot on the part
of bands of Chinese suitable for mili
tary service. All the leading young
Chinese who have aided the Russians
are leaving Mukden.
BT. PETERSBURG. Sept. 18.âGen
eral Eakharoff has reported to the gen
eral EtaS, under date of September 17:
"The Manchurian army was nowhere
engaged on September 16 or 17. The
arrival of considerable reinforcements
Is noticeable at the advance positions
along the whole of the enemy's front,
and especially near the village of
Biantupuza and east of the railway
toward the Yentai mines."
It Is announced from Mukden that
both the Russians and Japanese gen
erals have promir-d to respect the
tombs and palace there.
ST. PETERSBRG. Sept. 19, 2 a. m.â
The reports that General Kuroki is
pushing on northeast of Mukden are
not borne out by official telegrams that
have been received here. According to
the latest advices the Japanese forces
continue to increase at Bianiupuza and
Tental. A decisive advance in the di
rection of Mukden, therefore, is not ex
pected to occur for some days.
'LONDON, Sept. 19.â It is asserted in
a dispatch from Tokio to the Express
that the Japanese are vigorously shell
ing the Russian positions at Mukden,
preparatory to a general advance, and
endeavoring, by a wide turning move
ment, to cut off General Kuropatkln's
retreat. The Japanese armies, the dis
patch adds, are disposed in the same
relative positions as In the fighting be
fore Liaoyang-.
TOKIO, Sept. IS.â Marquis Cyama,
commander in chief of the Japanese
forces in the field, telegraphed this
morning that General Oku had re
ported having eaptureG thirteen pris
oners at the battle of Liaoyanr. He
also gave a detailed list of the Rus
sian stores which General Okuu cap
tured, as follows: Thirty horses, 2288
rifles, 127 ammunition wagons. 5832
rounds artillery, 639,930 small arms
cartridges, great quantities of timber,
flour, rice,' forage, engineering imple
ments, clothing, and accoutrements.
Marquis Oyama reports that the
armies under Generals Kuroki and Nod
zu made no- prisoners in the fighting
before Liaoyang. General Kuroki cap
tured forty horses. S00 rifles, '300 rounds
of artillery and 600,000 rounds of rifle

11G-1 rounds of artillery and 37,530
rounds of rifle ammunition, three heli

General Oku captured sufficient tim
ber to construct railroad depots."
BAR HARBOR. Maine, SeDt. IS.â
The Russian embassy here has re
ceived the following communication
from the general staff at St. Peters
burg:
"The official report of Marshal Oyama
regarding the occupation of Liaoyang
after a severe fight is not exact, as
Oyama could not name any quantity
of prisoners or guns captured by his
troops, ard without this his dispatch
would appear too meager for the Jap
anese public, which was awaiting news
*>f immense spoil having been captured
to atone for the tremendous losses sus
tained in the battle by the Japanese
anny. The Japanese commander in
chief invents the following facts: Two
old railway cars and several broken
up commissary wagons are referred' to
by Oyama as 'an immense supply of
provisions and railway material'; sev
eral empty ammunition boxes are des
ignated as *a great quantity of ammu
nition left by the Russians in the en
trenchments and forts." As to the 'dum
dum bullets.' they are simply our well
known apocopated revolver bullets."
Among the heaps of dead the Prince
saw two soldiers, one a Russian and
the other a Japanese, lying locked in
a death embrace. The teeth of the Jap"
anese were sunk in the Russian's
throat, while the Russian had forced
two of his fingers into the eye-sockets
Prince Radzivil declares that the
men of both armies are absolutely
venomous in their antagonism. Lieu
tenant General Stoessel has addressed
his garrison, saying that the present
mood of the Japanese indicates
clearly the necessity of resisting
them to the last drop of Russian
blood, because if the Japanese sol
diers entered the fortress, it undoubt
edly would be impossiblcfor their of
ficers to control them and prevent a
massacre. For this reason Lieutenant
General Steossel is making no objec
tion to civilians leaving Port Arthur.
When the 300 women who are in Port
Arthur, engaged in hospital work,
were advised to leave, they replied
they would rather face the possibility
of massacre than desert their posts.
WOUNDED ARE LEFT TO TERISH.
In consequence of the fact that flags
of truce are ignored, numbers of Jap
anese dead, which have been lying on
the slopes of the hills of the northeast
defenses for weeks past, are still un
buried, and the stench in Port Arthur
from decomposing bodies, when the
wind is in the right direction, Is al
most unendurable. The Russian sol
diers, who are in some cases posted
only fifty paces from heaps of decay
ing dead, have constantly to wear over
their noses handkerchiefs soaked In
camphor, as otherwise they would be
unable to remain at their posts.
In the course of the assaults which
took place In the four last days of
August two companies of Japanese
soldiers, according, to Prince Radzivil,
found themselves at the mercy of the
Russians and hoisted a white flag. To
this, however, the Russians paid no
attention and continued to volley rap
idly into the helpless ranks of the
enemy. In the meanwhile Japanese
troops in the rear of the companies
that had raised the white flag saw
what their comrades had done and ex
pressed their disapproval of the surren
der by firing into their rear. As a/re
sult of this fire from friend and foe
600 men were annihilated. The dead
fell among the decomposing bodies of
previous assaults.
For days afterward the wounded men
in this area raised fluttering handker
chiefs in their hands in plea for help,
but the Russians were afraid to ven
ture out to give succor. Within a week
the last arm had made its last un
regarded prayer for help, and the sham
bles was a quiet but ghastly field of
horror.
CHEFU, Sept. 18. â According to
Lieutenant Prince Radzivil of the Ru-s
sian army, who reached here last
night from Port Arthur, bearinjr dis
patches from_ Lieutenant General
Stoessel, the commander in chief of
the forces in the Russian stronghold,
to General Kuropatkin, the temper of
the belligerents at Port Atruhr has
reached an absolutely merciless stage.
Prince Radzivil served .with the
Eritish In the Boer war, and he says
that until he became aware . of the
state of affairs at Port Arthur he had
no Idea waf'could be so horrible.
It was set forth in 'these dispatches
seme weeks ago that serious sus
picions were entertained by each bel
ligerent that the other was misusing
the -Red Cross flag. These suspicions
have been increased by the commis
sion of various acts by the soldiers of
both armies, until now even flags of
truce or surrender are not respected
by either side.' >.-::
" 'But you can die," their command
er said in reply, and they perished at
their post.
"The fact that, the Japanese have
upon several occasions used explosive
bullets has been verified by Lieutenant
General Stoessel. He gives an instance
which occurred at/- Takushan, when
two men of the Sixteenth Regiment
were killed by such bullets, their bodies
being blown to pieces.
"On September 14- the bodies of 2600
Japanese soldiers were disco\'ered be-

when it found its position to be un
tenable it sent the following message
to Lieutenant General Stoesqel:
" 'We are unable to hold th*is posi
tion.'
"Individual acts of heroism during
the fighting have been numerous and
the tragic death of.Lieutenant Petroff
was long" an absorbing: topic of con
versation. Petroff became surrounded
by some Japanese soldiers, who he
fought successfully until his sword
broke. He then used his fists upon
the Japanese, but their bayonets
quickly pat "an end to his resistance.
Before his sword broke Petroff suc
ceeded in incapacitating eight of his
antagonists, but his body was covered
with wounds.
"The newspaper Novi Krai has been
suppressed for one month for having
published matter considered to be
detrimental to Russian interests.
"There has been no fighting since
September 1, with the exception of
artillery and outpost exchanges. The
Japanese shells, however, have done
great damage to the hospital and oth
er buildings in Port Arthur, but the
loss of life from these bombardments
has been very slight.
"Mtne. Stoessel; wife of the general,
is at the head of the Red Cross work
in Port Arthur. She is in constant
attendance at the hospitals and cares
tenderly for wounded men. In addi
tion to this exhausting work she finds
time to give succor to orphans. .and
widows and to superintend the.-making
of bandages. The soldiers consider
her their guardian angel.
STOESSEL IS GARRISON'S IDOL.
"The garrison " is maintaining a
strong and devofed martial spirit and
has great -confidence in Lieutenant
General Stoessel, who is cheered by
the men when he rides along the
lines.
"I left Lieutenant General Stoessel
in the best of spirits. He Is encour
aged by the heroic example set by the
wounded men, of whom 5000 out of
the original 8000 in the hospital have
returned to the front.
of his antagonist. The Prince cited
this as merely one incident denoting
the ferocity of the conflict before Port
Arthur.
PRINCE CARRIES DISPATCHES.
Prince Radzivil, another Russian of
ficer, two civilians and one woman,
the wife of a Russian staff officer, left
Port Arthur on the night of Septem
ber 16 in a junk.
Prince Radzivil got into Port Ar
thur a fortnight ago, â¢ carrying dis
patches from General Ku-opatklr^ to
Lieutenant General Stoessel.
The Pripce and the officer accom
panying him brought out dispatches,
reports and mail matter from Port Ar
thur, weighing in all eighty pounds.
They were successful , in escaping the
vigilance of the Japanese.
- "The stories in circulation concern
ing the shortage of ammunition and
provisions at Port Arthur are not
true," said the Prince. "There is an
abundance of ammunition for both
large and small arms, and plenty of
preserved food. The use of Chinese
shells was merely a saving measure.
Prince Radzivil gives another ver
sion, from hearsay, concerning the two
companies of Janaese troops that sur
rendered. According to this version a
Japanese battery fired on the two com
panies when the white flag was raised,
whereupon the two companies turned
and charged the battery. According'to
this same version General Nogi, who
happened to be present, was killed in
this charge of his own men, as were
several of the Japanese gunners.
Persistent Chinese rumors have been
received here lately to the eflect that a
successor to General Nogi has arrived
at Port Dalnv, but this is denied by
local Japanese. ';'â¢-*

Rabbi Nleto delivered a profound ser
mon at Sherlth Israel, taking for his
text, "Good and upright is the Lord;
therefore will he teach sinners in the
way." (Psalms, xxv:8). The rabbi said
that man's concept'Ion of God is always
consequent upon the degree of civiliza
tion and the enlightenment to which he
has attained. God, he said, is not a
man of war, nor the strict task master
inflicting punishment for error, nor the
partisan God warring for his â¢ friends,
but the kind and beneficent influence
which not only allures to goodness, but
directs all men in the path that leads to
holiness. , <
There were services at the Geary
street Temple, conducted by Rabbi M.
S. Levy; Bush-street Temple, Rabbi B.
Kaplan; Russ-street Synagogue,! Rabbi
H. Samuelson, -and in Franklin Hall,
Fillmore street, Rabbi Isidore Myers
conducted a service and preached to a
great assemblage of worshipers. Rabbi
Myers will conduct an all-day service
to-day in Franklin Hall and will preach
a sermon at 3 o'clock this afternoon.
We of the honeehold of Israel are not grovel-
Ing in the dust before our Father in Heaven.
We always approach him with a degree of
confidence that expresses our relationship of
children to him. Neither do we consider that
we munt make ourgelves miserable during our
present life to aÂ« to gain God's friendship after
we are deaJ. We are practical and intelligent
l-eople. who look upon the relations between
ourselves and God the same as we study the
conditions of human paternity.
This .one day Is set apart for the emphasis
of isuch thoughts as may not readily occur to
us at any other time.
We need this atonement -sven to remind us
that we are only nr?n and women. We forget
this often enough In our arrogance and inso
lence generated by our little capacity to
achieve little things â that Is, little compared
with the things achieved by God.
Yom Kippur, the most sacred day in
the Jewish calendar, was ushered in

gogues of the city la*st evening by the

sins that may- have been committed
during the year.
The usual evening service was then

building- are quieter now , than for
some time, our firm Is" kept busy an
swering ' inquiries for improved and
unimproved property in Alameda.
| This inquiry in Itself Is a good indi
cation of future prosperity and Is due
in a measure to the extensive adver
tising that the - natural advantages of
the Island City have been receiving of
late. . -
ALAMEDA. Sept. 18. â There is a
lull in the local real estate market
which is attributed by some of the
dealers to the quietness that usually
exists during a national political cam
paign. Building is not so lively' as it
has been, but the demand for modern
cottages continues in excess of the
supply. Here is what some of the
ftrras have been doing and the way
they view the situation:
Charles Adams & Co. â We have
made three sales within the last few
weeks. We disposed of a cottage on
Pacific avenue to a Mr. King and an
other on Fifth street to a Mr. Gimbel.
We also negotiated the transfer of a
large lot on Encinal avenue, near Oak
street, on which we plan to erect three
cottages next month. The houses will
each have five rooms and be fitted up
in modern style. We are also com
pleting a colonial cottage on Bay
street, near Railroad avenue. Rent-
Ing has been good, with us and we
could rent many cottages if we had
them at our disposal.
Hally & Co. will this week move into
their elegant new office at 2315 Santa
Clara avenue. This firm is branching
out and hereafter Leo Robblns willbe
associated with it as salesman. The
firm recently completed a cottage on
Driggs avenue for Samuel Grummett.
William Dufour & Co. negotiated
the transfer of a cottage and lot on
Clinton avenue, near Park street, be
longing to the John Young estate. This
firm has just completed a six-room
cottage at Encinal avenue and Willow
street for Mrs. Sara Roundy.
Frank N. v Dodd of the Alameda
Land Company â One noticeable fea
ture of the realty business at present
is the number of old houses that, are
being remodeled and improved in up
to-date style. When a substantial old
residence ia thus improved if is easier
to rent it. There are many Inquiries
for unimproved property and we ex
pect soon to erect several 'large resi
dences if deals we have on hand are
put through:
DEMAND IX ALAMEDA.
A contract has just been leÂ£ by W.
Morgan to A. Scott for the erection
of a modern apartment-house at the
corner of Nineteenth and Franklin
streets, the cost to be $19,000.
The new Emeryville hotel, which is
being erected on Park avenue, near
San Pablo, by S. Lehman of Point
Richmond, is nearly completed. The
outside work has been finished and the
plasterers are now engaged on the
interior. The structure contains forty
rooms. Four large stores occupy the
ground floor.
The Oakland Water Front Company
has begun the work of reclaiming a
ten-acre tract cf tide land just east
of Adams wharf and south of First
street. The property! has a frontage
of 1500 feet on the north side of the
estuary, along which a bulkhead will
be constructed at a cost of $25,000.
As. soon as the bulkhead and fill are
completed the property will be leased
to a large lumber company for yards
and docks. .
More than half the offices In the new Union
Savings Bank building have already been re
served and some of these have been rented to
professional men from points as far distant
as the State of Maine. All these facts indi
cate that many of the people now seeking
homes and business locations in Oakland have
been attracted to this city ty its natural ad
vantages.
We have at preserjt more prcspective pur
chasers for properties In this city than we can
possibly supply, and many of these people are
from out of town points. In the recent real
estate auctions held In Oakland more than one
third of the purchasers have been from Â£an
Francisco and other cities in California and
from the East.
Frank J. Woodward, president of
the Oakland Real Estate Dealers' As
sociation, said to-day:
Although 1600 new dwellings have
been erected in "this city during the
last twelve months, local real estate
dealers say they have lately expe
rienced great difficulty in providing
houses and flats for newcomers who
desire to buy or rent homes in Oak
land. In some localities it is almost
impossible either to buy or rent, the
houses recently erected having been
taken even before completed. This" is
true both of cottages or houses built
to be sold, and dwellings and flats
erected for the purpose of renting.
This demand for homes has not been
the result of; old residents of Oak
land moving from one part of the city
to another, for even when the de
mand was heaviest there have been
but few houses advertised for sale
or for ' rent. The increased demand
is the result of a steady influx of new
residents coming from the East and
from other cities in California. -A
considerable number of these new
comers are San Franciscans who have
been attracted to this side of the bay
by superior climatic conditions and
other natural advantages.
TALKS OF KECEXT GROWTH.

"It was nothing but a joke," said the
electrician. "But I gues the joke's on
me now," he mournfully added.
It was not a joke that the policeman
utr in the prank, if prank it be. The
patrolman saw only a case of larceny
and he acted accordingly, despite
Frandt's i>rotcstations that he was a
respectable business man. None of the
prisoner's companions went to the res
cue. He was hustled off to jail and his
burden was recorded as evidence on the
charge of theft.
As the result of a wager John E.
Frandt, an electrician, rests in the City
Priaon with a charge of petty larceny
registered against his name.
Frandt was arrested at 3:S0 o'clock
Â«HÂ» morning at Ninth street and
Broadway by Policeman Tillotson with
fifty feet of two-inch hose in his pos
eession. He had taken it from the
Southern Pacific Company's station at
Seventh street and Broadway.
Frandt declares that he meant to do
no wrong, but he had an idea that he
could win a Let made with some roy
Â¦terlng friends. The wager demanded
that Frandt should carry off the red of
nose that lay in the station and suc
cessfully elude the- police.

1016 Broadway, Sept. IS.
This tract war bought bv me, and stood in
my name for awhile. The facts that can be
Euhrtantlated by the records are that the land
was purchase* for ?25u,C0O, that the Hlbernia
Rank Of San Francisco eent experts to value
the lanU, who fixed the price in tbe market as
$:<CO,000. ind upon that report the bank
Inuned $ 175.00ft. The city is getting the tract
for ?3OU,0OO. ' .
Frank J. Woodward, the man who
purchased the tract in question for the
Realty Syndicate, said:
I regret the attack upon any feature of the
bond i.Â«.Â«uc, and I do not believe that this one
has any foundation. Mayor Olney has de
clared in publ'c that this land was being se
cures! at what ihs Realty .Syndicate paid for it.
with 0 per cent intera.Â«. I am told the samft
thine by other gentlemen who would hardly
tell an untruth for the amount Involved, and
who say that the syndicate will lose the
amount cf taxes paid upon the land since Ha
purchase. I believe this statement, for the
people who are making the "sale to the city
have put one hundred times the amount in
volved in this transaction Into' Oakland and
ere hardly in a position to falsify for the al
leged excels of tho actual value of the land.
Edwin Stearns, secretary of the Oak
land Board of Trade and president of
the Oakland Progress Federation, said
to-day:
The expected attack upon the bonds
has come almost upon the eve of the
election. It has come with the state
ment that the land proposed to be sold
for the main park is being offered to
the city at a price that is too high. As
sessor Dalton's figures of assessment
and some mysterious "they" and "the
people who are oppc^ed" are quoted in
support of the attack.
The real facts are that this attack
has been taken to several if not all of
the papers that circulate in and about
Oakland, and those who have the bond
issue at heart have Â»been expecting
that something of the kind would find
its way into print before the election:
So much has this been expected that
Mayor Olhey made an attempt to fore
stall it In his address before the Swed
ish-American Club on Friday night.
The Mayor said there was something
of the kind in the wind and he wanted
to say that the land in question had
been offered to the city by the Realty
Syndicate at exactly what they had
paid for it, with 6 per cent added for
their investment. He believed that the
land was being offered at a fair price
and one that would be deemed low in
the market.

Her action to"-dar seemed peculiar,
for the mother has made application to
the' Superior Court for a modification
of the divorce decree that she might be
given custody of the children. Hearing
on the petition is set for next Friday.
Wood had intended to_ resist the effort
to take the children from him on the
ground that the mother did not ha\e
proper accommodations for them.
Mrs. Wood, her companion and the
girl, the latter crying and begging to be
h f t at home, were followed by Miss V.
Tyrrell, another of the startled family,
but the trio disappeared at Fifth ave
nue >and Eighteenth street.
At the moment of the invasion little
Margaret was near the front door and
was seized by Mrs. Wood. Mrs. Tyrrell,
aroused by the cries, rushed out, but
was roughly grabbed by the man, who
shouted:
"You can't have the girl. Mrs. Wood
is getting her rights."
Wood made vain search in the vicin
ity where the abductors were last seen
by his niece. Miss Tyrrell. He declared
he would swear to a complaint to-mor
row for his former wife's arrest.
Wood was granted a divorce and cus
tody of his son and daughter, this after
a warm contest. According to the de
cree cf divorce Mrs. Wood was permit
ted to see her children once a month.
Wood says there never has been any
obstacle thrown in the way of his
former spouse when she desired to visit
her offspring.
Right from under the eyes of father,
aunts and cousin little Margaret Wood,
7 years old. was stolen this afternoon
at 4 o'clock from her home. 1307 Sixth
avenue, bv' Mrs. Alice Wood, her moth
er, the divorced v.-ife of the father,
Jacob Wood, who holds the legal cus
tody of the abducted child. Such was
the complaint lodged by Wood with the
police.
.Mrs. Wood, who conducts a manicur
ing establishment, was accompanied by
a young man, who fought off the detei
rcnt efforts of Mrs. J. C. Tyrrell, an
cuTit of the child.

'It is time to revive the bonding
question," President Rickard declares.
"A meeting will be designated at which
the history of the scheme will be fully
reviewed and immediate steps taken
to set a date for the election. I believe
that the bonds will be carried almost
unanimously, 'for I have not yet heard
of any opposition to the issue."
The bonding scheme has been in
abeyance for six months. A committee
of representative citizens discussed the
various items for the proposed issue
and recommended that the following
amounts should be raised: Street im
provements, $7000; storm sewer con
struction, $160,000; city wharf, $50,000;
city hall, $100,000; school improvements,
$125,000; public parks. $20,000; manual
training equipment, $20,000; flre depart
ment improvements, $35,000, making a
total of $517,000. The items will be
voted on separately, so that the im
provements now deemed necessary may
be rejected if the voters so prefer.
Within u month the electors of
Berkeley will go to the polls and vote
on a proposition to bond the city for
$517,000 for certain improvements.
Thomas Rickard, president of the Board
of Trustees, believes that the time is
now ripe fcr a revival of the bonding
scheme and announces that he will
bring the matter up at the next meet
ing of the board. ' As the Trustees are
known to favor the bonds the proposi
tion Is expected to go through with a
rush, so that it may be submitted to
the people upon a day not more than
a month distant.

RENO. Sept. 18.â With a trunk, a
box and a suitcase containing 600
pounds of ore. the choicest from the
Goldfield district, in his possession,
John Sherman was arrested here to
night. The arrest was made just as
he was stepping out of the baggage
room, where he had checked the pre
cious nxk through to San Francisco. -
The officers of Goldfield had been fol
lowing Sherman and his companions
lor some time. He left Goldfield yes
terday morning and orders were imme
diately telegraphed here to shadow him
and place him under arrest. He ar
rived to-night en route to San Fran
cisco.
Sherman said that the ore belonged
to him. He claimed he bought it for
$159. Its value is conservatively esti
mated at $5000. He had a partner, but
the fellow escaped.
The prisoner and l.ls partner are
thought to be members of an organ
ised band that has been robbing the

George Laforge, after seventeen years'
service with the Southern Pacific Com
pany, has been dismissed since the
wreck of train No. 5, of which he was j

have also been . dismissed. -' The com- !
pany has held these three men respon- j

When the accident occurred Conduct- j
or Laforge was helping a woman in a '

two trains came into collision. Had he j
been watchfur he would have noticed j
that the engineer had taken the train i
past the siding upon "which it should f
have gone and would have pulled the

has gained him a high regard in the
Foreign Office at Berlin and promo
tions and transfers to other stations
have been open to him for many years.
But he has preferred to make his home
In San Francisco and has no intention
of leaving.
The German Government would allow mo to
retire, but I do not contemplate doing so at
this time. I feel that my health is good
enough to Justify my continuance in the office.
Of course, 1 might change my mind at any

my *veniars tr> the rapidly increasing business.
I finally Jedded that I was sacrificing; my

I felt that I owed myself a vacation, and I
therefore made a request of my Oovcrntnent

will be allowed as much time am I desire. I

The appointment of Franz Bopp,
German Consul General at Montreal,
to the corresponding poet in this city,
as announced in the dispatches yes
terday, is only for the time that Con
sul General Adolph Rosenthal is absent
on leave. Consul Bopp is expected to
arrive In October to take charge of
the busy San Frcuicisco station and
Â¦will serve during the several months
that Consul General Rosenthal will
spend in a rest from the arduous du
ties he hps performed so faithfully and
creditably during the last thirty years.
Mr. Rosenthal said last night:
"Who is the little aear?" chirped
Harry Lehr, when he saw a dainty
vision in white enter the tennis courts
at the Casino. When he caught a
glimpse of tbe face beneath the sun
bonnet he'hurried over to congratulate
Mrs. Waterbury.
"The most daring and picturesque
stunt of the season," he said, and from
Lehr that was a compliment.
Mrs. Waterbury is just above me
dium height. The effect of her white
skirt was startling. It would have been
six inches above her shoe tops, had
she worn shoes, but her dainty feet
were encased in white canvas ties. Her
stockings of white silk came into view
generously. The skirt material was of
white canvas and her shirt waist ot
flimsy silk peekaboo. About her laugh
ing face hung the truffled edges of a
sunbonnet of thin white. linen. If her
hair had been worn In curls Mrs.
Waterbury would have passed for a

innovation. She seemed immensely
pleased with the sensation her appear
ance created.

The Outdoor Art League of this city
is devising a general plan for t^he en
couragement of window gardening.
This plan of house adornment is in
expensive and can readily be adopted
by all classes aitti particularly in small
homes, where yard space is limited and
flowers a rarity.
At a recent meeting of the league a
paper prepared by Mrs. Alice Meynell,
a well known writer of England, was
read, showing that the window gardens
of London and other large English
cities had assumed extensive propor
tions and were now a feature of the
English home.
The league also has under consider
ation the subject" of forest fires. The
recent destructive fires In the Santa
Crus Mountains and in Marin County
have wrought such havoc that the
league will urge that immediate meas
ures be taken to , prevent a recur
rence of such a calamity.
The league has appointed a perma
nent committee on conventions In view
of the fact that San Francisco has
become one of the chief cities of the
country for these large national gath
erings.

The Mills Club held its first meeting
of the year last Tuesday at the Sorosis
Club house, with Mrs. J. M. Litchfield
in the chair. After pleasant greetings
had been exchanged Miss Violet Van
Orden gave some exquisite vocal se
lections, "Sea Dreams," by Metcalf,
winning special comment. Miss Julia
Hunter completed the programme with
a talk upon physical culture.
After the tales the following numbers
were given, under the direction of Mrs.
S. P. Blumenberg: Violin solos, by
Miss Grace Freeman, "Romana"
(Ivendson) "Perpetuum Mobile"
(Ries); fancy clog waltz in costume,
Ramon Landsberger; buck and wing
dance, Lorine and Ramon Landsber
ger; pyschic Halk, Dr. T. B. Janes;
dramatic solos, Mrs. Rose Charlotte
Mitchell; accompanist, Miss Ina Lang
worthy.
That psychic talk of Dr. Janes was a
famous treat â no hobgoblins nor spooks
to shrink from when darkness fell â
but a fascinating chat upon the weird
wonders of the mind. And as 'tis said
that the women of San Francisco have
gone psychic mad. Dr. Janes' talk
swept in on the wave of demand. Much
cleverness is looked for in the Cap
and Bells, as many of its members do
things worth while.
"Now, with such things as that
ringing in our cars "for centuries 'tis
a wonder that we women aren't bigger
fools than we are," so sayeth she of
the Cap and Bells: "And therefore is
it that we are gathered together in
our little club to glean from a busy, but
a jolly old world some of the wit and,
the wisdom it holds for such as seek
them."
That really tells the tale of the Cap
and Bellsâ it's a wit and wisdom club.
The meeting Thursday was held at
the home of Mrs. W. S. Gage, 2470
Broadway, with Mrs. W. P. Bucking
ham presiding. The programme opened
with story tellingâ the fine art of tell
ing a tale with the head and tail in
logical sequence, which achievement
was, until now, an accomplishment
thought to be wholly masculine. Ah!
If the men could but have heard some
of those feminine stories, on Thursday,
there would have been a shifting of
opinions in regard to the dearth of wit
in woman.
BY LAURA BKIDE POWEIiS.
" 'What is woman? Only one of na
ture's agreeabie blunders!' Now what
do you think of that for a declaration?"
cuoth a member of the new Cap and
Bells at its meeting on -Thursdayâ
"and Cowper, who was one of the
gentlest of poets, said it right out in
meetin'.
Never were matters social so still as
newâ never save at Lenten time. But
it augurs well for future activity. The
quiet hours are storehouses for
strength and purpose, and the coming
oZ October will bring with it the gay
est of gay seasons â unless, indeed, "the
whole cityful goes to the exposition
at once. No such fears, however, since
hosts have' gone already and are al
ready back.

To-morrow the California Club re

As an influence toward civic better
ment the club has been a leading factor
ever_ since its organization, growing at
times a littJe erratic, 'tis true, but do
ing its large part in the- world's work
as it thought best. Richard K. Faulk
ner will talk to the club to-morrpw up
on the parental school, a matter that
vitally concerns the club, whose inter
ests lie with little children who stand
in need, be it moral or physical. And
much of new matter in relation to de
pendent and delinquent children will be
brought out by one who is a specialist
on those interesting subjects.
The Women's Auxiliarl of the British
and American Union lÂ»?ld its annual
election of officers last 'Monday after
noon. The officers chosen to serve for
the ensuing year are: ?Mrs. G. Alex
ander Wright, president^ Mrs. William
Greer Harrison, first v,^ce president;
Mrs. Richard Leach, setfond vice presi
dent: Mrs. Brooker, corresponding sec
retary; Mrs. William Artnitage, record
ing secretary; Mrs. Edward Thayer,
treasurer. Directors were also chosen.
Thanks were extended to the members
of the retiring board for the efficient
manner in which the work had been
carried on in the several departments,
and a hearty welcome was given to
those newly elected. At the social
meeting to-day Miss Agnes Murphy
will give a talk. At this late day no
word need be said in eulogy of the
clever Australian's wit. Miss Murphy
and her charming friend, Miss Aimee
Moore, have during their visit become
rather a part of San Francisco club
dom.
The first regular meeting of the Coun
cil of Jewish Women, Mrs. Louis Hertz
president, was held at' the Temple
Emanu-El, on Sutter street, yesterday
afternoon from 2:30 to 4 o'clock, and a
very attractive programme was ren
dered. It . consisted of two well exe
cuted violin solos by Samuel Augen
blick, an amateur, whose work shows
talent of unusual ; order. Miss Miriam
Meyerfeld, who has a mezzo-soprano
voice of fine timbre, sang two selec
tions, "Thou Art Like Unto a Flower"
(Rubenstein) and "Obstination." The
address of the afternoon was given by
Miss Eliza D. Keith, who spoke with
splendid eloquence of the old missions
of California and the Camino Real that
connected them, closing with an earnest
appeal for the restoration of the famous
old highway. The subjects for the study
circles for the year were announced as
follows: Parliamentary law; current
topics, conducted by Rabbi Voorsanger;
Jewish literature, conducted by Rabbi
Kaplan. The philanthropy circle, now
under the management of Miss M.
Voorsanger, furnished entertainments
to the old people in the various institu
tions for the aged in San Francisco.
The council holds its meetings on the
first and third Thursdays of each
month. It is a branch of the National
Jewish Women's Council, organized at
the Chicago World's Fair for the pur
pose of promoting a knowledge of
things Jewish. At the next regular
meeting, which is undf:?.* the auspices
of the chairman of the committee on
religious subjects, Henry Weinstock of
Sacramento will deliver-an address on
Spinoza. J
That talk of Mr. Williams on what
he knows of early San "Francisco will
mark a red letter day in the club"s
annals. Every able-bodied member
should be in her chair early on that
day, that not a fact of that precious
story be lost.

"I have met customers who com-
plained that Postum was not good, but
we always found this due to the fact
that they tried to make it as they used
to make coffee. Of course we set them
right by pointing out the reasons, tell-
ing them they must boil Postum 15 or
20 minutes after boiling commences,
then they get fine, choice and delicious
Postum." Name furnished by Postum
Co.. Battle Creek. Mich.
Look in each pkg. for the famous lit-
tle book, "The Road, to Wellville."
"Coffee drinking used to affect my
nerves and stomach, but since we have
been using Fostum in our 'family in
place of coffee the bloated feeling after
eating has disappeared and my head is
now clear and stomach and nerves all
right. We all feel better In every way
and find Postum just aÂ» satisfactory
to our palates.
Postum Coffee is not made like ordi-
nary coffee, for it takes at least 25 min-
utes' cooking to briny out the heavy
food value of Posturn. It requires some
effort for those things which are really
worth while â making Postum requires
a little care.
The grocer is in a position to hear of
those lazy ones who will not take the
trouble to make Postum correctly. "I
am well acquainted indeed with Pos-
tum." said a grocer of Camden. N. J.,
"fbr I meet it not only at my break-
fast table but I am also associated with
it daily in my business."

MRS. W R. WHEELER. PRESIDENT OF THE SPINNERS' CLUB. WHO FIRST
SITGGESTED A WORK LIKE "PROSIT." THE CLUB'S WISE AND WITTY
WOMEN LOST NO TIME IN ADOPTING ' THE CLEVER SUGGESTION*.
CALIFORXIAXS who have returned from St. Louis report the
exposition to be the greatest of all the world's fairs. From
this it is apparent that St. Louis has accomplished her pur
pose, for she intended to eclipse everything in that line heretofore
undertaken in this country and Europe. All of the great manufac
turing and commercial nations have special commissions tlmre,
making a careful study of all the exhibits and noting the progress
made in products and processes. This is the educational purpose of
the exposition, which makes it pay the countries that have made the
exhibit. Its spectacular function is quite another matter! ':
As a show, interesting to the superficial observer who merely
wishes to look at things without making them the object of profound
study, the exposition is also unsurpassed by any previous eflort.
But such visitors are far. below the number expected. The Eastern
patronage falls much below expectations. Some of the most meritori
ous special exhibits, attractively housed and displayed and having
the benefit of every means of attracting attention, report a registered
attendance of only 1400 people per week. At Paris the California
exhibit made by the State Board of Trade often had 10,000 visitors
per day. The fall months may improve the attendance at St. Louis,
but the gain must be enormous to repair the existing, deficit of visi
tors and make a record of attendance and receipts that will enable
the exposition to be a success in that respect. Distance and popula
tion considered California has made a better attendance record than
the densely populated States near at hand.
It is probable that the East is satiated with these great exposi
tions. The Columbian at Chicago, the International at Buffalo and
this at St. Louis have not been far enough apart to permit attention
and curiosity to revive and satiety to disappear.
These causes will not apply to the Lewis' and Clark Exposition at
Portland next year. The population to which it will appeal is not
blase and can afford a patronage amply sufficient to make it a suc-
From the club's clever president, Mrs.
W. R. Wheeler, earns the flrst sugges
tion. With the usual discouragements'
and encouragements that envelop a
new idea the suggestion grew tillâbe
hold, to-day "Prosit, a Book of Toasts,"
is on the bookshelves about town, beck
oning to every lover of the stein and
wine and i the" .-- good fellowship they
stand for, 'to, buy and imbibe.
Ah ! ye who love not > the clink of the
glass know not what music sings from
out the pages of -"Prosit." Herewith
are a few of the singers -who toast:
Omar, the, Persian; Horace, Anacreon,
Milton, Shakespeare, Thackeray, Gold
smith, Tom Moore, Byron, . Bobby
Burns, Madame de Stael and others of
that immortal company clinking glasses
side by side with four own, 'mor

Wallace Irwin, . Howard V. Sutherland,
Gelett Burgess, George j Sterling, .Anna
Strunsky," Jack London;' James D.vPhe
lan, Ednah Robinson, Ernest Sylvester
Simpson and a host [ of others wbo say
proud proclamation: And if you don't
believe it â it's hard to believe anything
clever that's home-made â just get a
copy c&"Prcsit, a Book of Toasts," sent
forth from Paul Eider's last week. And
if your heart's right, and your diges
tion, you'll agree that that little gray
book of good fellowship is a trump.
Now, those Spinners, of whom there
are about forty and five wise and witty
women, put their pretty heads together
and concluded that there was a deadly
dearth of tasty toasts in Bohemia and
its suburbs, and 'twould be a philan
thropic thing to glean some good old
ones and to write some good new ones
and present them to a rather prosy old
world twixt covers.
PRESIDENT'S IDEA.
ATTENDANCE AT THE FAIR.
HOLIDAY â E. B.. ci^y. Congress
has not declared Labor day, the first
Monday in September, a national hol
iday. It is a legal holiday in all tha
States and Territories (and District
of -Columbia) except Arizona, Missis
sippi, Nevada and North Dakota. In
Louisiana it is observed as a legal hol
iday in Orleans Parish. In the Dis
trict of Columbia it is a legal holiday
by an act of the second session of tho
Fifty-third Congress.
THE SHRINERS â L. L. R., City.
The Ancient Arabic Order of the
Nobles of the Mystic Shrine is not a
regular Masonic body, but its mem
bership is composed strictly of Ma
sons who have reached the Thirty

89 temDles in the United States and a
total membership of about 90,000.

IT h?.3 long been an article of faith
to believe in the "charm" of West
ern women â even as in Kentucky,
where men swear by their women's
beauty instead of their Bible's truth.
But as charm is a mystical thingâ
neither brains nor beauty, but some
thing of both â 'tis a. new thing, and
a welcome thing to find the"' "brains"
of Western women proclaimed to the*
world.
And to the Spinners' Club of San
Francisco docs the credit belong for the
"Located for from the Empire of Si
lence and close to the settlement of
Utopia, embracing in its suburbs the
Republic of Letters, its principal in
dustry is the expression of thought;'
and the freedom of its people is the
condition of their existence; their in
centive is fame, their guerdon is glory,
and their happiness springs from en
nobling employment and consciousness
of creative worth; and this land is
called Bohemia."

land of tranquil peace, whose love is

mon pursuits, and whose progeny, is
the children of the brain.

The counselors of Europe are now inquiring whether 1" ranee
is ready to throw over. the Russian alliance which' has served her
so well in the days of reconstruction and embrace the idea of a
close understanding with England and Italy as the other high con
tracting parties. Certain it is that in the last sad year of Russian
difficulties the republic has done no more than live up to a per
t furictory adherence to the letter of the alliance, the while turning
willing eyes to the delicate overtures of England. Will a total
defeat of the giant of the Xorth bring about a complete realign
ment of the powers, with France espoused to the cause of isolated
England and the crippled Slav leaning upon a friendly German arm ?
This is the question now buzzing through the star chamber sessions
of the diplomats.
TUCKED away in the corner of a London newspaper there
recently appeared the modest news note announcing that the
British Army Council had determined upon removing from
the lt-le of Jersey the regiment of regulars stationed there am'
leaving to the local militia the dignity of representing the military
arm 'of the empire. Thus for the first time in. years this little
outpost of England, which lies almost within cannon shot of France,
is to be left without a semblance of protection.
Though insignificant in its superficial essence this move on the
part of the British Army Council carries with it certain demon
stration of the present spirit of diplomacy between the ancient foes
on either sides of the channel. Not since the Crimea, when fear
of the Slav joined England and France in active alliance, has a
rapprochement between the two powers seemed to embody such
a spirit of accord and unanimity of. sentiment as that existing at
present. The arbitration treaty of last year, followed by the sub
sequent arrangement of difficulties between the two countries in
the matter of North African control and South Sea jurisdiction, led
to the visit of King Edward and the heaping up of diplomatic
attentions on the part ofVthe enthusiastic Frenchmen. Six years
ago "Fashoda" well nigh spelled war; to-day Jersey Isle is left
without a redcoat.

COPYRIGHT 1004. BY SPECIAL ARRAXG EMEXT OF THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL XV 1TI1 THE NEW YORK EVENING MAIL
THE expansion in general trade observed during the past several
I weeks still continues. The changed conditions from dullness to
1 increased activity are strongly illustrated by the pronounced
increase in the bank clearings over the corresponding, period last
year, the gain last week being 18.1 per cent, while the volume ot
clearings mounted from about $1,750,000,000, where they have been.
for a month or two, to $2,150,000,000. The increase at New \ork|
was 31.8 per cent, at Philadelphia 164 per cent and at Minneapolis j
26.8 per cent. The failures for the week were 224, against 219 for
the corresponding week last }*ear.
On this coast the conditions are decidedly bright. As we are
largely dependent upon our crops for our income, the agricultural I
status' is the main feature to be considered. The wheat crop of Call- '
fornia is below the normal, but the grain is bringing such very good
prices and is in such brisk demand that -the deficiency in the yield
is more than offset by the enhancement of the returns. The barley
crop is also comparatively light, but it, too, is bringing profitable;
prices, with an excellent demand both for local consumption and!
export. Oats arc unusually high and #ery firm, with a demand j
which absorbs all the receipts. Wool has been very firm for months, j
with a first-rate demand, which has taken all the arrivals at good â¢
prices. Hops are extremely firm at quotations almost 200 per cent j
over cost of production, and with the bulk of the 1904 crop already
passed out of growers' hands, and it is only the middle of September.
Hides are in good request, with an advance in salted stock. j
With the exception of raisins and prunes, which are in oversupply
and neglected, dried fruits are in active demand and very firm, with
peaches end apricots passing out of growers' hands at a rapid rate.
The hay crop, though large, is selling at very good prices, which re
turn to the farmer more than good interest on his landed investment. .
The grape and wine industries are reported in satisfactory condition, \
with the wine merchants in the field wanting to make contracts with j
the grape growers for five years at profitable rates to the latter. The j
bean districts are not behind in the wave of prosperity, and in the i
Lima districts down on the southern coast buyers are bidding $4 \
per cental for this description, with the growers very firm in their j
views and not disposed to let go. The dairy interests have had a j
most excellent year, with prices. considerably above the normal and j
a fine demand." which has consumed all the butter and eggs pro- j
duced, to say nothing of very large lines brought in from the Middle ;
With the farmer thus highly prosperous, active and remunera- ;
tive trade conditions ensue as a matter of course, and as a result we I
have a lively local and export demand for the products of our soil, j
plenty of money in the city and country banks and in private hands, j
an active demand for country real estate at prices which show an ;
advance over those ruling for some years, an equally good move- 1
ment in city and town real estate, with building operations during
the past year larger than they were several years ago. It is safe j
to say that, bright as trade conditions have been during the past five ,
or six vears, they are even now on as sound and encouraging founda
tions as at any time during this period, though the activity may be
characterized by less fever than during the preceding two or three (
vears.
TRADE CONDITIONS STILL CHEERFUL.
But It can be stated here on the
strength of the doctor's own clear-cut,
nervous handwritingâ in the inevitable
purple Ink. without which I suspect ha
would consider himself quite helpless â
that he Is about to begin writing a big â¢
sociolological work, on which he has
been meditating for the last six years.
It may be said in a general way that
it will deal with modern tendencies of
mankind as manifested in the unrest
of our time.
Dr. Nordau's work is generally writ
ten in German, although he seems
equally at home in English and French.
His latest novel, which I understand
has an American hero, was translated
by Miss Elizabeth Lee, sister of Sid-
ney Lee. the Shakespearean scholar.
Dr. Emil Reich, whose industry, ver
satility and fiery zeal reminds one of
Dr. Nordau. is also spending his vaca
tionâIn his favorite Contrexaville.
France â working as hard as when ha
stays at home. He has In hand a huge
scheme to bring his native Hungary
more prominently before the world at
large; is editing a series of readers on
philosophy, theology, natural science
and political economy for a new Lon
don publishing house; Is putting some
finishing touches on his "Universal
History." and amusing himself be
tween whiles with magazine on
slaughts on the critics of his latest
book, "Success Among Nations." The
doctor stands manfully to his guns in
what was considered by some of the
American papers as an attack on
American woman. He says it is ab
surd to interpret his appreciative com
ments as an attack. But he has a def
inite impression that there are lines
along which American womanhood
could develop to greater usefulness.
and at last accounts he was setting
down these impressions with his usual
vigor and enthusiasm for immediate
publication in the United States.
LONDON. Sept. 1.â Dr. Max Nordau,
the author of "Degeneration." Is about
the ' last man In the world one would
expect to find busying^ himself with
fairy stories in the midst of a life
crowded to the uttermost with science,
literature and Zionism, not to mention
political correspondence. Yet I re
ceived a letter from the versatile doc
tor yesterday in which he says: "I am
finishing now a book which is to stand
alone in my life work, namely, a vol
ume of fairy stories, mostly humor
ous, but some also pathetic, as I told
them to my little daughter, Maxa,
from her fourth, to her seventh^ year,
which she accomplished in 1904."
The doctor writes from the island
of Jersey, whither he has gone from
his Paris home in the Rue Leonie for
a bit of "vacation." which he is enjoy
ing in the fashion prescribed by the
good old proverb, "A change of work
is rest." Since "Degeneration" made
so much talk in the United States, Dr.
N.ordau has written no other book of
this sort, turning his hand # indeed to
the writing of novels, of which the
translation of the latest. "Morganati
cally," is about to be published in Eng
land and the United States.

One of his paragraphs is as follows:

CAili TO .IMMIGRANTS.
Colonel John P. : Irish voices "Cali
fornia's Call to the Immigrant." This
is of an much practical interest as any
topic that can be Eelected. "It. is not
pretended," writes. Colonel Irish, "that
California supplies 'any specific from
her wealth of sc-il and sunshine that*
will cure unthrift,' bad judgment and
lack of faculty, or, make the do-less a
doer, but there is legitimate basis of
belief that here the average man may
woik, in greater comfort, more -days
in the year and earn his bread easier
than under the conditions that prevail
in any other State or country." Then
he says:
All stenff fruits ar.d the fig, pomegranate,
orange, lemon, lime, pear and apDle are pre
cocious bearers. The peach will bloom the
second year from tlv^pit. . On the Mediter
ranean the olive fruits measnrly at seventeen
years of arc; here It bears c , full crop at
seven. In the Ka*t he mi st be a young man
who plant* a. trte expecting to reoosc in lta
shade or to eat Us fruit.. Here old men may
plant and surely expect to enjoy the results.
The growth of animals I* not checked here by
the withering winter nnd a yearling horse is
the equal of any Kastern two-year-old.
But,- It may be asked. Is not this precocity
of . animate and Inanimate life combers Â».ted
by early dacnv? The answer Is, No. That
rule has here its exception! The peach tree
that liloon'3 before thi shell of the Dit.that
bore It Is decayed bears on for thirty j-ears or
more. O'lve trees thit furnished oil for the
sacraments of the okl mission fathers a hun
dred years arosnnde the graves of the .gar
dener* who planted them and ripen their yÂ«ar
ly eron wits unabated enerry.
- But mfn fall In California? Yes. Men who
buy lur<d and hltv It 'planted and worked, run
ning it on the absentee landlord system, fall
hern and everywhere. So do men fall who run
manufactures and trade on the same , system;
But men who take here only so much land as
they have the,- mean* and the ability to con
serve,-and can properly till and tend with the
labor of -their own families, do not fall, for
here < nature help* the- industrious .hand, and
nowhere One dot* lnt*llle*nt labor add as
much to the value of the land, for the reason
that hÂ»>re r.atutn hold* one handle of the plow.
Horticulture here rises to the rank of a pro
fession. â¢-: Our soil and climate are go adapted

FORESTS OF CALIFORNIA.
"W.. H. Mills has a very valuable
essay oh the forests of California In
which he^says:
A ecnrf rvative. approximation of the quan
tity of merchantable lumber Ftandlng In the
forests of California reaches the vast total of
four hundred and forty billion feet. Since the
forests of California are found In the moun
tainous districts of. the State, the topography
of the floors of these forests possess interest.
Topography Is the controlllnK factor in the
economic production or lumber from California
forests. Thene forested lands are divided Into
hjdrographlc district*. In the commercial
a*j>ect of the subject the catchment area of a
system makes all the forests grown ur>on It
tributary to the canyon line which consti
tutes the central drainage of that hydrographic
area. In the parlance of the lumbermen, the
lands In a single drainage area car* usually
be "worked tcsether"; which means that the
instrumentalities of bringing the loss to t ha
mill and the lumber to trunk lines can be
brought downward to the central line of drain
age, and the construction and maintenance ot
thepe Instrumentalities is very coetly. The
profit of lumbering l*. therefore, largely de
pendent upon the magnitude of the enterprise
relating to these hydrographic districts. .â¢ :
â¢ At" least seventy-five per cent of the forest
floors of California are Incline planes, and of
these planes at least .sixty per cent have a
declivity of twenty ; degrees.
The epace allotted to this article in this pub
lication will not admit of any extended dis
cussion as to the effects of forests upon the
climate of California or the influence denu
dation would have upon the meteorological
conditions of the State; but It will be accepted
as a pardonable digression to call attention
to the very obvious, fact that, since 'seventy
five, per cent .of the forest areas Â¦ of California
are found uoon Inclines of. from : . fifteen to
thirty decrees, the absence of. the forests. win

The most ambitious attempt that has
yet been made to give to the world in
une collection of essays the facts con-
CerttlBg characteristic industries of Cal
itornia is to be attributed to the Cali
fornia commissioners to the St. Louis
Exposition. More than thirty leading
Californians have devoted time to sup
plying information that is practical in
its bearing, and the collected essays are
now getting wide circulation among the
crowds that visit the exposition. There
are undoubtedly thousands who will
peruse what has been written, and cor
respondonce and general enlightenment
will follow.
There is much in the essays that is
admirably adapted to teaching Califor
nians what there is in this State to ad
mire. In a condensed form or in ex
tracts there is much that Californians
Â¦uill read with pleasure. "California"
is the collective name that the St.
Louis commissioners have placed on the
essays that they have caused to be
written. The text is illustrated with
I'ictuies t.f scenes that reflect the genius
of the countr;-. While there are thou
s-anrls of strangers in the State who
may not visit St. Louis, some portions
of the essays are considered to be time
ly for publication.
BRIGCJS ON AGRICULTURE.
Arthur R. Brig^s. manager of the
California State Board of Trade, is the
author of two articles that are included
in the book issued by the California
commissioners. One of these, with the
caption of "Agriculture in California,"
contains much that is new. Among his
many statements are the following:, se
lected for use here on account of the
amount of information contained in
them:
When it Is understood that California, the
eÂ«rond Ftate in tlze in the Union, has a total
land area of 155.WVJ square milee. or M.mi,
20u *crcs, of which 2S.9 iÂ«r cent, cr Ufr.SJS.Sd
acre* were included In farms when the cen
sus of 1JK!O mi taken, some general Idea of
its magr.itude ac â¢Â» farming area in received.
BBt m I*rt cf California has yet been devel
oped fÂ» Its capacity, either as to product*
or In the selection of ru< h Â»f are ultimately
to be of the greatest profit. Intensive farming
has been exemplified in eeveral counties, bui
not one of them has its whole cultivable area
in crrjÂ». Another consideration in ertimatir.R
the arrt<*u'tural possibilities of California is
that the soil and climatr are favorable for the
growth of all the products â that is, valuable
ar.d high-priced crops â which made the re
frion around the Mediterranean unique and
jrave it an exclusive trade until California in
tervened; also, that here in the Fame local

A great river broucht under human control
makes all the difference between hopeless des
olation and the highest forms of civilization.
Professor E. J. "Wickson of the Uni
versity of California has treated the
subject of 'â¢Horticulture in California."
He begins by calling attention to the
fact that fruit growing and the manu
facture of fruit products constitute the
leading industry of California. Dealing
with fruits in detail very valuable in
formation is afforded. About the ap
ple Professor Wickson says In i>art:
California has about 3,51)0,000 apple trees,
of which one-fifth are not. yet In bearing. The
success attained In growing a winter apple
vÂ«-r>' Â«atlsfactoty to the trade and cspaMe
of distant shipment constitutes this fruit onÂ«
of the most promlclng and popular at the pres
ent time. About one thousand carloeds are
shipped beyond State lino*, and a considerable
quantity reaches the London market, selling
at the h'.gheft j*ric?a. There are two distinct
branches to the apple Industry of California.
One Is the growing ot i-ar.y varieties like the
Astrachan a.nd Uravecslrin for sale in the
northern i>arts cf the Pacific Coast and "in
the Interior mountain States before the earliest
ajiplf* can be ripened in lhoÂ»e part*. The lo
calities where the6Â« early varieties are chiefly
prown for such shipmtnt are In the Sacramento
Valley and tbÂ« foothills norroundins; it. Th*
forcing heat cf the eprinjr and early summer
bring thene varieties quirkly to notable size,
crispness and flavor. This heat, however, con
tinued Into the summer and autumn, make*
the same districts quite ill-suited for the
Krowth of winter apples, which are prematurely
ripened and lack quality and keeping power.
The second, branch of the California apple
industry, then, the production of winter ap
ples. Is undertaken In parts of the State qultÂ«
different In climate from that of the early ap
ple regions. The requirements of a winter ap
ple are fully met by two main divisions of
the State, viz. : The smaller valleys close to
the coast â In fact, !n some capes, the coast
flats, where the exposure Is directly toward
the cooling breezes of the ocean, which pro
duce a cool summer â a long, slow-growing
seaeon which develops the greatest beauty
and highest quality In a winter apple. Simi
lar results are also produced by the climate
found at an elevation of from 2500 to SOGO feet
on the interior plateaus and in the moun
tain valleys. The coast district has developed
a greater commercial apple industry than the
mountains, because transportation facilities for
shipment are vaetly better; but as the State
advances the mountain districts will be em
ployed in this production much more largely
than at present. The greatest apple district
of the State i> the Pajaro Valley. Including
parts of Monterey and Santa Cruz counties,
centering at Wataonville, which shipped ' about

of Labor issued to-day has this to say
as to the situation in State and na
i lion:
â¢ "In the first quarter of the year, ow
i ing to labor disputes, unusually cold
and stormy weather, and lessened ac
tivity in a few industries, employment
i was very poor, but subsequently there
j was so much Improvement that June
j and July actually* surpassed the ree
| ord year of 1902. Among approximate
' ly 100,000 wage earners in the various
industries of the State, 137 per 1000
were reported idle at the end of June,
1904, as compared with 231 and 145 in
i June. 1903, and 11)02, respectively; for
j the clcsn of July in 19o2. 1903 and 1904,
! the respective ratios were 156, 173 and
14&. The principal' cause of this im
j provement was the phenomenal activ
ity in construction work in the lead
ing cities.
'â¢Conditions of employment in the
I entire country manifest similar im
provement, according to the late sta
* ( ttetics collected by the American Fed

It Is said that among 85.450 members of

Great Improvement Is Due
to the Phenomenal Activ
ity in Construction Work
The construction of the lighthouse on
Mile Rock, for which the preliminary
work has begun, will be attended with
gTeater difficulties than the engineers
anticipated. The rock, which is a prom
inent object at the entrance of San
Francisco Bay, is always submerged by
waves during stormy weather. It is
about three-eighths of a mile north of
Point Lobos and its area is about 1000
square feet. This will be reduced by
cutting and blasting to 701 square feet.
Its form will be changed from that of
a cone to a pyramid. On a base sixteen
feet above low tide the steel cylinder
will be built as the foundation of the
lighthouse. Over 800 yards of concrete
will be required to fill the cylinder. The
rock itself will be excavated, and down
in these submarine caverns will be
rooms for water storage and for the
light and siren engine.
The blasting operations can only be
carried on at extremely low and still
water. Only a few hours can be used
during the twenty- four, and weeks may
go by before an approach to the rock is
possible. The rock itself is of a Hint
formation and exceedingly difficult to
dig through. The schooner Wing and
Wing, which is ntted for the work,
cannot get nearer than forty feet to the
rock, and men and material must be
thrown ashore by means of long booms.
During the last month only a few
hours' work has been donel but the con
tractors hope to finish the construction
of the foundations of the lighthouse
within the four months assigned for the
completion of the work. The great
foundation cylinder must be built up,
plate by plate, from the water level,
subject to the state of the tides and
winds. No lighthouse on the Pacific
Coast, not excepting the famous light
on Tillamcok. has offered the peculiar
problems and difficulties of construc
tion fount', at Mile Rock. The comple
tion of this work will be a triumph in
civil engineering and the addition of a
splendid light to San Francisco harbor.

REAL) ESTATE TRANSACTIONS.
SALINAS, Sept. 18.â "Jack" Webb's
statement that he had killed Jacob
Miller ten miles from town last night
is true. To-day Miller's body was
found lying about forty yards from his
house. The Coroner's examination
showed that he had been shot in the
right side, just below the seventh rib,
and in the left side, of the neck. Death
must have been instantaneous.
Investigation shows that Webb, in
stead of following the usual road from
Salinas to his home, just beyond Mil
ler's, had driven across lots until he
came to Miller's place. Here he at
tempted to open a gate and cross Mil
ler's land. The latter ordered him to
desist. Webb, however, persisted in
trying to open the gate, whereupon
Miller, who was armed with a double
barreled shotgun,,flred. Webb returned
the fire with his rifle and Miller fell.
Webb at once came to town and sur
rendered himself to the Sheriff.
As -there were no witnesses Webb will
probably be allowed to 'go free. He is
well connected and bears an excellent
reputation for good character and hab
its. .

When the time limit had expired at
Oakland 4n the morning each team
was credited with five runs, so a truce
haji to be declared. Both teams
played rather ragged ball, Oakland
especially. Schlafley had a chance to
do something in the last spasm when
the bases were filled and two 'gone.
But all he had was a nice grounder
to Flood. The score:

ST. LOUIS, Sept. IS.â Ab the closed
season for airship flights in the grand
prize matches at the World's Fair ap
proaches, the question of extending
the time and otherwise modifying the
rules governing the contest is being
considered by the aeronautic commit
tee. The time limit set by the rules
before which the contestants for the
grand prize must ha\ - e made their trial
flights is the 30th inst. As this Is only
eleven days away and none of the
contestants as yet hss made a suc
cessful flight and no definite dates have
been set for future titaJ flights, the
question of extending the time for the
contests rather than have them go by,
default Is receiving the serious consid
eration of the exposition authorities.
At present there are only three aer
onauts in the city who have entered
the match for the grand prize. They
are T. C. Renbow of Montana. Captain
Baldwin of^San Francisco and Francis
Conteur, a French aeronaut, who ar
rived in St. Louis Saturday. Of* the
three Benbow is the only one who has
m?de a trial flight. At the time he es
sayed to fly, his airship was not free
of the ground, being held captive by
a rope from the ground and he of
course did not qualify. Captain Bald

Is known positively to have qualified
for an entry in the contest for' the

Four of the teams entered played
from the same mark â "owe fifteen."
Tracy Crawford and Will Allen, who
won the cups in the first tournament,
were beaten by Long and Janes in
the first round. Allen played good
tennis, but Crawford was somewhat
out of practice and did not give his
partner good support.. .
Carl Gardner and B. Nourse. play
ing from scratch, got as far as the
semi-finals. Here they won the 'first
set from Long and Janes, but lost the
next two.
In the other semi-final match Al
Kenyon and Melville Long beat Mac-
Gavin and Kuehn 6-0 the first- set,
and with. the odds allowed them,
looked like sure vtfnners. MacGavin
and Kuehn took the second set by a
small margin, the score being 9-7. The
last set they won easily-, 6-3.
The first set of the final match was
exceedingly, close and It seemed Mac-
Gavin and Kuehn might win without
a handicap. After this set it dawned
on Long and Janes that better results
would be obtained by playing every
thing to Kuehn. The latter did his
best; but was a trifle overworked.
Long and Janes are now tied with
Schmidt and Rolfe In the race for the
cups. Each team has won them twice
and another victory will give the
trophies to them permanently. The

Schuetzen Park near San Rafael pre
sented a busy scene yesterday as the
large number of marksmen pressed foe*
ward to be accommodated in the shoot
ing boxes. So many riflemen visited
the range that early in the day it was
necessary to put extra targets into
service. The California Schuetzen Club,
Turners' Schuetzen Grutli Verein and
Eintracht Schuetzen all brought many
participants to take part in the month
ly events of the different clubs.
William F. Bla?se carried off the
honors in the California club competi
tion, with the good bullseye of 180
points. Wiliiam Ehrenpfort, the cen
tennial champion, was close up and
carried off the second prize. In the
pistol competition G. M. Barley and
L. J. Reubold, with 8S rings each, were
the victors in this event. Jacob Iten
of the Grutli club led his comrades in
the race for the best bullseye, closely
followed by A. C. Gehret. The Adam
Brehm trophy was - won by Louis
Schmidt of the Eintracht shooting s?c
tion. Following are the scores:
The deciding course in the Class
stake at Ingleside Park yesterday be
tween Clover Blossom and Colored
Lady furnished one of the most ex
citing trials ever run at the field.
Clover Blossom was a onÂ© to two fa
vorite. They were slipped to a strong
hare. Colored Lady led and made the
first points, much to the surprise of
the spectators. Then Clover Blossom
took command, evening up the score
and eventually winning.
Many greyhounds which appeared to
have a good chance for the finals were
beaten through severe running. Lost
Chord had a hard trial with Butte City
in the fourth round and when he met
the stake winner in the next round he
was defeated easily.
Frank C was withdrawn in the final
of the Reserve stake on account of
severe trials and first honors went to
Prometheus, which ran in excellent
form throughout the day.
The talent had the best of the day,
as the few shortends that scored were
held at small odds. Rector gave bet
tors, a hard jolt when he was beaten
by Colored Lady in the fourth round.
They ran an undecided course and the
bettors were still willing to lay the
opening price of three to one against
the Lady. She scored easily. Follow

A young greyhound came out of the
south yesterday and defeated all the
northern cracks in the fifth renewal of
the Junior Champion stake at Union
Coursing Park. E. Janicke's Eagle
Bird, a son of War Eagle and raised
In Los Angeles, defeated F. Brown's
Humboldt In the all-important decid
ing course. The winner, which was at
1 to 4 in the ring, led by five lengths.
He also proved the cleverer worker,
Humboldt securing tiut one turn and
the kilL Eagle Bird beat In turn Sir
Upton, Flower Girl, Sampler and then
Humboldt after a bye course.
Blaze, the Futurity winner, was beat
en decisively By Sampler in the first
round. Rocked Asleep was retired in
the second round by Hudson in a short
trial.
The Commuters had the best chance
of the day in the last period, but still
the massive southpaw refused to weak
en, so they were sent away runless.
Dunleavy doubled to the right field
fence with one out and brought down
the bleachers by a daring steal to third.
Schafley had naught but a dinkey little
fly and Newton struck Kruger out
without an effort, so the crowd was
forced to go away without having the
pleasure of seeing -Oakland get a run.
Newton's performance yesterday was
one of the greatest exhibitions of the
year and certainly the best he ever
gave in this city. His control was al- _
most perfect, and besides blanking the'
Commuters and retiring them hitless
In every round save two, he struck out
ten men. The score:
Oakland â 1 Los Angeles â

Up to the seventh not an Oaklander
could hit the ball out of the diamond.
Then, witty two gone, Kruger and Mos
kiman each swung through to center
field, ano: the crowd thought the big
stunt was about to be pulled off. Dev
ereaux then filed to Cravath and the
peep in did not materialize.
Chase responded with a drive right
through to center and Cravath dashed
in. Chase took second on the throw
in and went up a peg on Toman's drive
to the same spot. Then Mr. Jones
showed his lack of baseball nerve.' He
walked Ros3, Spies and Newton in a
row and forced Chase in with the sec
ond and last run of the day.
The game was almost marred by a
tragedy. Buck Francks, the first man
up in* the initial round for Oakland,
was struck sauare on the temple" 7 by
one of Newton's terrific inshoots. He
dropped like a log and remained un
conscious for fifteen minutes. Buck
was later removed to the Central Emer
gency Hospital, where he recovered
sufficiently to be taken home. He -will
play no more baseball for some tjme.
The Angels managed to break in for
the only two runs of the game in the
third inning. Cravath lined a drive out
to right field and was bent on stretch
ing it Into a double. Ganley fielded the
sphere cleverly and made one of the
prettiest throws of the year to Schlaf
ley. The erratic second baseman
dropped the ball and the man was safe
on second with two out.
Doc Newton cave the big Sunday
crowd at Recreation Park yesterday
a chance to be awed. 'Everv one was,
including the Oakland players. The
giant southpaw ' had his opponents in
a helpless condition from the time the
ball went into play till Kruger made
the last out by swinging at the tihrd
strike. "Twas a masterly exhibition of
the pitcher's art and a sight worth
seeing. Scoreâ Los Angeles 2, Oak
land 0.
Just as usual, Jones got that wobbly
streak in one inning and after the An
gels had batted in a run he walked
three without, a miss and forced an
other over the pan. The Commuters
played a fair sort of game with a
patched up team. Had any other
pitcher been working against them
they might have treated the Southrons
to a sound thrashing.

Miss Florence. Roberts entered upon
her farewell week at the California last
evening in "Zaza," a production which
seems to still stand in favor with the
theater-going public, Judging from the
crowded house that witnessed the per
formance last night. Well supported
by Hobart Bosworth as Bernard Du
frane and .William Yerance in the role
of Cascart,' Miss Roberts deeply . inter
ests her .audience in the leading J char
acter of the play which she admirably
sustains throughout the evening.
"Zaza" will be continued "until Wednes
day; evening and on Thursday "Tess of
the diJrbervilles" l will . be substituted
and continue until the end of the week.
Pinner, did particularly good work and
was rewarded with floral tokens. Miss
Grace Reals as Sally Sartoris captured
the audience with her bubbling good
humor and Miss Gordon also did good
work. The leading part was taken by
J. H. Gilmour, who was well supported
by the rest of the company. The play
is. on for the week and will be followed
by. "Captain Barrington."
- The police have a clew to the man
who stole the $20,000 from the First Na
tional Bank Saturday. Last night Cap
tain Martin received a telephone com
munfeation from a man whose name is
not to be used stating that the robber
was supposed to be in the Dempsey sa
loon, at 144 Third street. Detective
Bralg was hurried down there, but the
game had fled.
One of the bank officials, who has
been on the trail of the thief, met Braig
at Dempsey's saloon and the two hur
ried In the direction of Third and Te
hama streets. The bank official, who
refused to give his name, spotted his
man in the saloon. Telling two men in
the place to watch the suspect, he hur
ried to the telephone and communi
cated with Martin. While he was thas
engaged his bird became suspicious and
escaped. As soon as the bank man re
turned he saw that the robber had
gone, also the two men he had appoint
ed watchmen. He met Bralg and the
two hurried in the direction given them
,by the bartender as that which the
fugitive took.
At Third and Tehama streets Braig
and the bank man met the two who
followed the robber. They said they
had followed their man and had lost
him near Tehama street- Bralg searched
around the ; neighborhood without suc
cess. He obtained a good' description
of the robber and spent the remainder
of' the night south of Market street in
the hope of running into his quarry.
The police are reticent regarding the
clew given them last night and endeav
ored to keep everything quiet. Captain
Martin expects to, land the robber in
prison before twenty-four hours have
passed if he does not leave town.

WASHINGTON, Sept. 18.â Pending
an investigation of the case. State De
partment officials are* disposed to treat
as a fraudulent scheme to obtain
money the information which press
reports from Pasadena, Cal., state has
come to a relative of Congressman Mc-
Lachlan of California, of the reported
death of Louis Blaisdell in a Spanish
hospital and the detention of his 14
year-old . daughter in a convent at
Arajuez.
According to the views of the de
partment officials the report' bears the
earmarks of the work of^ a gang of
impostors who have operated* at vari
ous places in Spain for a long time
and who have obtained sums of money
from foreigners who have believed the
representations made to them. The
customary practice of these impostors
is. to report that* a parent has died,
leaving a confession with; a priest and
a young daughter in his charge, and
the information is conveyed : that -a
certain amount of money is ' ; required
to . obtain access to or data" concerning
the location of a fortune' which the
decedent . is . alleged ; to . have left- to ; a

WASHINGTON, Sept. 18. â Senator
Charles W. Fairbanks passed Sunday
in Washington. Except for a brief
walk, the Senator remained the entire
day in his Â¦ apartments at the New
Willard Hotel, resting preparatory to
resuming campaign work to-morrow.
Accompanied by his secretary and his
son, Fred Fairbanks, the Senator
reached the city from Parkersburg, W.
Va., at 7 o'clock this morning.
Early to-morrow he will leave the
city' for Dover, Del., to attend a Re
publican rally there in the afternoon,
to be followed by a night meeting at
Wilmington. Thence Mr. Fairbanks
will go to Baltimore and make a
speech on Tuesday and after that to
Reading, Pa.
The Pacific Coast trip, on which Mr.
Fairbanks will be accompanied by
Senator' Dolliver, will begin from Chi

A number- of the . : witnesses that
must be relied' on in the { prosecutions
are regarded as somewhat unstable;
inasmuch as ..they are i frequenters of
opium dens and have small sense of
honorable duty. They were gathered
up the night before the, primaries for
the early morning descent upon poll
ing places and were used to stuff the
ballot boxes by voting th<9 names .'of
citizens who - had not yet left 'their
breakfast tables. * Â¦'"'*' â¢
The principal witness against .Wy
man will be Fairfax H. Wheelan." who
preferred the charge. It is ""repre
sented that the case . against the de
fendant is strong, . because Wheelan
saw him commit fraud 'in voting, the
name jof S. H. Mann. , and Wheelan's
testimony is expected to have " much
weight with a jury, y . '. " .
In an interview yesterday. Wheelan
protested j against being brought ;. too
prominently .into publicity in regard'to
his 'participation in prosecution 'of the
election frauds. He said: . <^\ .
I am simply dolne my civic duty u a. citi
zen. I witnessed the violation - of ; law by.
Wyman. and I regarded It Â¦ as my duty, to
see that he should be punished. - I have, no
personal animus In the matter, and â¢ I * do not
enjoy all the notoriety the awe '-i will occasion
me. But my - aversion cuts no , figure. .; for , I
realize that I have a duty to perform/ as a
citizen and â¢ I shall not ; be deterred.* In i the
least because "Wyman has sued me for $250,000
damages and has sought to assail - me . and
my family. . ...;Â¦.
Wyman'i action Â¦will - not Â¦ Influence ' me ; one
way or the other. It wll arouse no vindictive
spirit and it .will not - deter Â¦ me.'; Â¦ He will be
prosecuted In - a determined manner " for his
Infraction of the purity of elections law, and
that U all there is to the case so far. as I
am concerned.- . ' ; ,
Though further arrests in connec
tion with the frauds at the primary
election may be made at any time, the
attorneys for the Merchants* Associa
tion say they do. not expect: any- Imr
portant developments until after .the
preliminary examination of Charles
Wyman is held on Wednesday. They
are trying to stave matters off till
then in order to learn Just how their
evidence will unfold itself in * court.
Other complaints will be withheld,
meantime, unless circumstances
should compel the Immediate swearing
out of warrants.

coxsmltted suicide last night at his borne, after
having been upbraided by bis pister. Mrs. Ross
man, lor being drtinlc. Hauer recently re
turned from Alaska, where be had been em
ployed In the fisheries. Ever elnce bis return
he had been on a protracted spree, HI* body
Â¦vsm taken to the Morgue.
The car had Just started from the
new Masonic Cemetery. Osborn and
Dinsmore were on the dummy when
the robber, with a white handkerchief
covering his face and a Colt's auto
matic revolver In his hand, stepped
forward from the rear of the car and
ordered them to throw up their hands.
The order was instantly obeyed. He
took Osborn's cap and told him to put
what money he had Into It. Osborn
obeyed and $25 75 found its way into
the cap.
The robber pocketed the money and
eald: "I am going as far as Colma and
â¢will go to the rear of the car. You
two ' stop where you are and if you
attempt to come to the rear I will
fill you full of holes." Each sentence
lie uttered was accompanied by a
string of oaths. When the car reached
Colma the robber had disappeared.
Osborn and Dinsmore describe him
as a man about 25 years of age, 5 feet
10% Inches tall, clean shaven and wear
ing a blue jumper, with white stripes,
blue overalls and a golf cap. The con
ductor and motor-man eay they would
know his voice at once.
Detectives O'Dea and Mulcahey spent
the early hours of yesterday morning
trying to find the masked robber who
held up Conductor L. M. Osborn and
Motorman F. A. Dinsmore at a point
opposite the new Masonic Cemetery
late Saturday night. They are satis
fied that he is the same man who held
up a car on the same line about three
weeks ago, and It is believed that he
belongs to one of the grading camps In
that locality.
All the signs are indicative of Repub
lican success in the Fifth District. E.
A. Hayes is a capable man, an able
campaigner and a citizen whose char
acter Is above reproach. In adjusting
factional differences in Santa Clara
County Mr. Hayes is giving an exam
ple of able leadership. He will not make
the mistake of underrating the strength
of the Union Labor nominee in the Fifth
District. It is expected that the old
line, hard-shell Democrats, who find
fault with everything, will support
Wynn, and he may run quite as well
as Lane ran in the last city campaign,
coming to the finish a beautiful third.
Williams, the Union Labor nominee,
possesses elements of popularity, but
he cannot bring into the fight the quali
ties of leadership which Mayor Schmitz
displayed in the city campaign of 1903.
Many of the Republican workingmen of
the Thirty-second. Thirty-third, Thirty
fourth, Thirty-fifth, Thirty-sixth, Thir
ty-seventh, Thirty-eighth and Thirty
ninth Assembly Districts who support
ed Schmitz in the last municipal cam
paign' are supporting the Republican
nominee in the present contest.'
General George Stone, chairman of
the Republican State Central Commit
tee, returned from the East last Satur
day night. In Chicago he exchanged
views with Chairman Cortelyou of the
national committee and Mr. Tawney,
director of the speakers' bureau. Gen
eral Stone says that an adjustment of
the factional differences in the Repub
lican ranks of Wisconsin has taken
place and there is no longer any doubt
that the State will give a substantial
majority for Roosevelt and Fairbanks.
The Republicans expect to carry Illi
nois by at. least 100,000 majority. The
Democrats no longer place Illinois in
the list of doubtful States, but concede
it to the Republicans.
Chairman Cortelyou is paying very
close attention to affairs in New. York,
Indiana and West Virginia. The pros
pects of Republican success in New
York and Indiana are encouraging, and
there is nothing in the West Virginia
situation to excite alarm. The Demo
cratic claim of advantage In Connecti
cut, Delaware, New Jersey and Rhode
Island is not justified by reports which
come to the Republican headquarters
from impartial sources.
It Is probable that George A. Knight
and Mayor Eugene E. Schmltz of Cali
fornia will be "assigned to duty as
speakers in Indiana and West Virginia.
The electoral vote of California is al
ready assured for Roosevelt and Fair
banks, but there will be disappoint
ment If the Republicans fail to elect
eight Representatives to Congress.
General Stone announces with a deal of
satisfaction that Charles W.. Fairbanks
of Indiana, Republican nominee for
Vice President, and United States Sen
ator Dolliver of Iowa will visit Califor
nia and speak in San Francisco - Mon
day evening, October 3. These eminent
leaders will talk to the people, in sev
eral other cities of the State.
It is known to the Republican State
Committee that the Democratic organi
zation is putting forth special effort to
achieve success In the First and Sec
ond Congressional Districts, hence the
Republican organization will endeavor
to awaken the voters of the party of
prosperity to a full sense of their duty
in this direction. *
"The Altar of Friendship," a comedy
drama in four acts, was well presented
at the ' Majestic Theater last night.
(Though .the " play, is not new to . San

' T. Trovolo, or whatever his name Is,
with the stage paint sapolioed from it v
was the surprise of. the evening at the
Orpheum. When tlje wise ones saw
"Novel .Ventriloquist" on the pro
gramme they thought "here Is where
we yawn." < â¢?).â¢ v
The curtain rose on the same sort of
dummies used br every other ventrilo
quist from Blibbettsville to Rubber
town in the . earn belt. But it " didn't
rise on the same ventriloquist.
The man with the Spaghetti Opera
Company name made < those carrot-fea
tured images "get off gags that would
make a bunch of average comedians
seem. like a Chinese funeral. "I -don't
know much about' Christian Science,
but it beats castor oil." "Where did
you learn such profanity?" "I didn't
learn it. .That's a gift."
.Gags like these sound as flat as the
calliope: when the boiler springs a leak
if you read them in black and white.
But when, you hear them from the
wooden mouths of those hatchet-faced
figures in Trovolo's flexible voice you
have to laugh.
Besides, good; Jokes and a voice that
can climb stairs and slide down the
bannisters, Troyolo has a trained dog
and the stage business that show the
veteran." He is half a vandeville show
by himself. ,
The Truesdell Company has a* skit
full â¢ of surprises and laughable cli
maxes. â¢"""* It's * probably about as good
as 1 , anything 'of -Its class that has been
at: the Orpheum. .The Melrose Troupe
did 'some wonderful tumbling. Mrs. Sni
der-Johnson, mezzo-soprano, received
several" encores. Leo Carrillo has im
proved his" turn considerably-since last
week.
.Willard Sims' Duke of Santa Crufc is
as clever a study in humorous senility
as .Teddy Webb's .Colombo is of the
broken-down tenor. Both are more
character studies than caricatures, and
both' therefore more deeply and adroit
ly funny. Sims' make-up is only next
to Webb's in naturalness, and both are
worth a visit, in themselves. Forrest
Dabney Carr makes himself very use
ful as Alavarado, Schuster sings a good
bass as Gomez and the rest chime in
admirably. ."The Serenade" gives the
chorus . plenty to do, and the Tivoll's
chorus cannot have too much. That
noble gagster, Ferris Hartman, though
lost to sight in the cast, Is there with
the ' gags. These are many and funny.
This is not to say that Mr. Hartman
has neglected his stage managing. This
is again excellent.
BLANCHE PARTNGTON.
If the Individual success of "The Ser
enade," brilliantly' revived at the Tivoli
last night, is not Dora de Fillippe as
Yvonne, it is Kate Condon as Dolores;
or Teddy Webbii. broken down tenor
if it Is not Vwiliard Slmm's Duke of
Santa Cruz; or perhaps 'Carres Alva
rado, or â¢ the Lcrpez by the new home
brown barytone, Andrew- Bogart, who
made his operatic debut last night. It
is a stunning cast* throughout and a
stunning performance. The "Sere
nade" is by way of obsessing the town
in its usual obsessive way, and began
last night on a large house that used
up most of its breath applauding. The
rest 'went for whistling.
The particular interest: of the per
formance centered in Mr. Bogart. Haw
would the barytdne bear transplanting?
His graceful and fluent art has long
been a favorite with local concert-go
ers. But not his best friends suspected
operatic leanings; nor could his worst
enemies accuse him of theatrical ten
dencies. Yet the singer took his debut
as though he took one nightly.
He came on, beribboned and seraped,
as though he were in the habit of walk,
ing down Market street that way.
Without a quaver he charged his fel
low-bandit with "conduct unbecoming
a bra va and. a gentleman"â his first
words on the operatic stage. There
was not a word lost, and Mr. Bogart
walked throughout on his own feet. He
has already learned how to sit still,
to walk, to speak with point and
clearly, and in short the singer, is
launched . with conspicuous success
upon his new career. The same ease,
brightness and fluency as usual distin
guished, the barytone's vocal effort. It
is an art peculiarly graceful, a voice
peculiarly sympathetic. Only one good
song unfortunately goes to the singer,
"Dreaming, Dreaming" â Mr. Herbert
did not foresee this one â but the audi
ence made up here for lost opportuni
ties. The song was encored and lustily
re-encored. The .Tivoli has again hit
the bullseye, and this time its name
is Bogart.
Dora de Fillippe In Alice Nielsen's
part of Yvonne develops still further
her special gifts. ' The part fits her to
her. tiny toes. Chic, dainty, whimsical,
spirited, it is an Yvonne to the queen's
taste. . For the "Cupid and I" song,
excellently sungâ though the rehearsals
had taken a little of the freshness from
the voiceâ Miss de Fillippe* was rep
turously encored, the flute 0 sharing.
Kate Condon, again stunning in Span
ish garb, is a charming Dolores. Like
the whole cast, she brings fun and
verve to her work. But what about
those low notes. Miss Condon? Chief
among your attractions â the vocal de
partmentâwas the wholly . unforced
production of the voice. Some of the
lower notes last night were as delib
erately forced as Collamarimi's of
sacred, memoryâ the Carraens are
comin'!
