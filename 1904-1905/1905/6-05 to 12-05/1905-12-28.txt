AGREE NOT TO LAY CASE
BEFORE THE GRAND JURY
Percy Declares Rich Friends
Will Come to Rescue of
Stock Broker
ATTENDANTS AT MEETING
ARE PLEDGED TO SECRECY
Twenty-five excited creditors and representatives of creditors of R. Brent
Mitchell, the bankrupt stockbroker, gathered in his office shortly after 2 o'clock
yesterday afternoon for the purpose of discussing ways and means by which they
might get back some of the money intrusted to the broker. After a heated
discussion it was decided by these creditors not to put the . matter before the
Grand Jury nor the police. John A. Percy, Mitchell's personal representative,
edmitted that there were no assets.
The utmost secrecy was maintained regarding the meeting. When the credit
ors gathered the doors of the room were locked and all representatives of the
press were banished. Before any action was. taken each creditor and representa
tive was pledged to secrecy regarding the council and every one solemnly de
clared he would not let a word leak out to the pressy
The meeting started out like a wild session of a lot of injured men and women
who would stop at nothing in order to force a settlement at once, but before the
session wa3 concluded most of the creditors hadvbeen calmed and decided to
settle down and listen to what the prime movers had to say.
The gathering was called to order by John A. Percy. Some one made a mo
tion that he be appointed temporary chairman, but at once a dissenting - voice
lawyer and would not take the responsibility at any cost, as he did not feel he
would be giving the creditors a fair deal In the matter. . â¢ . â¢ .
Several were suggested, but all declined. At last James Whiteley was named
as the best man to serve.- He tried to dodge the issue, but as he is known by
all. the creditors to be a man of millions and a cool-headed individual in business
matter*, he was urged to accept. He finally did, reluctantly; with the provision
that the committee to be appointed should confer with him at all times and keep
the others informed as to what the course would be. Whittley -did. not want to
take too much responsibility upon himself and was looking for protection in the
delicate matter.
The work of appointing a committee to Investigate the affairs and report to
tlie creditors was then begun. A. P. Welch was first appointed. Then Captain
Burnham was named, and finally George Mastick, attorney,, was agreed upon.
This committee was requested to take charge of the books of the insolvent
broker and inform the creditors by. mail concerning the date of the next meet
ing, which will probably take place within the next five days.
The meeting was first called to order by Percy. In a brief speech to the cred
itors hf said:
â¢Ladies and Gentlemen: This meeting is being held to-day by you creditors
to plan ways and means so that a settlement may be reached at an early date.
I will say that Mr. Mitchell's assets do not amount to anything. I believe he has
a few outstanding claims in Xew York and Chicago, but I do not know what
tLey amount to, and I fear not very much. Mr. ' Mitchell is confined to his bed,
suffering from nervous breakdown, and no one can talk to him regarding this
failure. r^.-
Percy Ajraia of Effect of Discord.
"There is only one thing for you crediiors to do. and that is to agree upon
some plan and go about this matter systematically. If there is any discord or
agitation your chances of recovering any money are slim indeed. I think the
best thing to do is to agree to settle upon last night's New York closing Quo
tations." \r
"But wh*.t is going to be done in this matter?" yelled an .excited creditor
"We want to know where the money is coming from? Is Mr. Mitchell going
back to practice law, start a steamship line or something else that will net him
something?"
"I do not know what Mr. Mitchell's plans are." said Percy. "As I have al
ready stated, he is in delicate health and w e shall have to attend to this matter
ourselves."
After the 'committee had been appointed a resolution was adopted aereeinc
wot to lay the matter before the Grand Jury. Some of the more excited credit
Bon? demanded an investigation by the inquisitorial body, with a view to havinjj
the failure thoroughly probed, so that the exact cause might be given to the
public.
But the majority was against such action. They argued that if the case were
. taken up by the Grand Jury and the police Mitchell's personal friends would-come
to his rescue with funds to save him from prison walls, and in the midst of this
legal battle the creditors would be entirely forgotten.
Agree Not to Go Before Grand Jury.
Percy stated that Mitchell has four or five wealthy friends whose names he
refused to divulge, who would surely come to his aid wUh the nelessaS "SndS
â¢ and tide the matter over. This seemed to assure the dubious creditors "nd they
finally decided to do all in their power to keep the case out of the hands of thÂ«
Â£Â£2Â£ SWSSLr' 1 " l 0 "" u " oth " 5 rt Â° â¢ ~ ~Â°Â« "
At this Juncture John N. Ross, attorney, collection agent and rem-esentatlve
of a number of smaller creditors, spoke up. "Gentlemen," said Rom Â«Â£ mu.t
keep this matter out of the hands of the Grand Jury if such a thini is nasSblV
I know by experience that it would be disastrous for us. possible.
"I know of such an instance in the Eppinger case. I represented a numhw of
creditors then, and they would have fared far better financially ha(Â« not Mr Rv
â¢ ington, the District Attorney, taken it upon himself to probe into the matter and
get the Grand Jury so deeply involved in it. We must guard against publicity
this time at all costs. - " y ;
"Therefore, before this resolution goes to a vote I make an amendment thÂ«t
. the utmost secrecy prevail. I want each creditor present to pledge himself not tÂ«
. say a single word to any reporter. There are a lot of yellow Jumalists in thu
town who are only too willing and ready to start a scandal. They will hint at 'Si
lusion if they are told anything, and this is liable to get some of the creditor.
dissatisfied, and then they will balk at our methods and upset our plans "
Ross* suggestion seemed to meet with the approval of the majority ts.v
wanted to keep the matter as quiet as possible, and all pledged themselves tifh.
guarded against all energetic reporters Ir.'search of news. The plan to keeis th
matter entirely from the' public is supposed to be in force still and will be fol
lowed out unless some hitch occurs. So far. as known none of the creÂ«.Â»iors cave
any information to reporters. â¢
Charles Clark, bookkeeper for the bankrupt broker and the man who knows
the entire inside workings of } the business, was appointed secretary of the meet
ing against his protest. He was instructed to write out the minutes fully - He
\u25a0 took the names of all the creditors and their representatives and said he would
Inform them by mall when the next meeting was to be -held, and promised to
keep them informed in the meantime of what was going on, and again pledged
all to secrecy.
Percy stated that he had the books of Mitchell in his possession and would
Kturn them over to Whiteley Immediately. He also agreed to give the committee
a complete list of the creditors, so far as he was able. The committee will begin
its work at once and make an effort to straighten things out so mat some kind
of a statement may be given ; the creditors within the next few days.
The creditors who attended the meeting, with the exception of the lawyers
appeared to be men in the more humble walks of. life,. those who are not In' a po-
Fition to stand heavy losses. All wore anxious expressions, and the pale and hag
gard faces of some showed only too plainly what their emotions were. Many ot
them, seemed desperate and ready to act on any impulse' that would'tend to bring
about some kind of a settlement.

In the throng was one woman of mature years. She entered the. office in a
very excited frame of mind and was taken in hand first by Bookkeeper Clark,

Special Dispatch to The Can.
CHANUTK. Kans.. Dec. 27.â The legls
lative committee of the Kansas OH Pro
ducers' 'Association has Issued an appeal
to tho -people of neighboring States to
work for rate legislation like that which
was enacted in Kansas last winter. Two
of the new Kansas laws have proved ef
fective against the Standard Oil Com
pany. These are the maximum rate and
discrimination acts. The maximum-rat a
law had the effect of cutting, the rates on
oil fully 50 per cent, which means a sav
ing of more than $50 on every car of oil
shipped.
Discrimination In favor of the Stand
ard, according to the committee, has ab
solutely disappeared in Kansas. But the
Standard and the railroads, while obeying
Kansas laws, isave, according to the com
mittee, "built a . Chinese wall around
Kansas. "Within the State they give us
a square deal, because they have to, but
whenever we croÂ«s the State line with
our "oils-; we are > commercially dead."
- As an illustration, it Is said that , the
rate from Chanuce to Kansas City. Kans.,

"the railroad* lurk at the borders of the

try, to ship oil outside \u25a0 the State, The
fact that Kansas has found a way to
control -the situation within the ' State
proves that a way can be found to con
trol it everywhere, and the people of the
West are strongly urged to work for rate
legislation, both State and national, that Â£
will bring the railroads and . the - Stand

Smith of New York City, a member of
the "Two Johns" theatrical company, was
shot and fatally wounded this afternoon
by F. C. Cooper of New York, a member
of the "Morris Island" company. The

Cooper. -^..'; "
Cooper was accompanied to the hotel
by Harry B. Walters of Minneapolis and
James Young of Chicago. He entered
Smith's room, locked the door and fired
five shots. The bullets took effect in
Smith's head and back. The three men
then attempted to escape from the hotel,
but were prevented by Richard Roberts,
the clerk, who held them until the police
were called.

Lobbyist Hamilton Explains Need of
Insurance Corruption Fund. â¢
Corporations Preyed Upon by Legislators
\u25a0| Laden^With "Ginch" BiUs.
Aa forecast In " The Call of yesterday, the statement sent from. Paris
by Andrew Hamilton, the lobbyist, who looked after the interests* of the
blflr life Insurance companies at varioui* State capitals, did not divulge
the names of legislators and politicians, to- whom Immense, sums' have
been distributed in -recent years. . Hnmilton excused the maintenance of a
political bureau by the 'insurance companies on. the ground that, they were
constantly subjected to attempted blackmail by -members of ' Legislatures,
who "held up" the corporations by the Introduction:: of "cinch" bills. He
Informed the Insurance Investigating Committee that he kept no books
uud no records of bis disbursements and would refuse [to .reveal the
identity of any person who had' been In his pay. . ,
NEW YORK, Dec. 27.â Andrew
Hamilton, the legislative agent of the
New York . Life Insurance Company,
who, according to testimony, has been
intrusted with hundreds of thousands
of dollars by the company and has not
accounted for $235,000, has been heard
from by the legislative committee, but
has declined to make an accounting.
â¢ A statement by Hamilton was read
to-day. It was. presented by. Secretary
John C. McCall of the New York Life,
who went to Paris to, secure an ac
counting from Hamilton.
In his statement Hamilton says that
he is unable to v produce any books or
accounts, because he undertook, the
legislative matters for the life insur
ance company with the express under
standing that he was to make no ac
counting. Absolute secrecy was neces
sary in retaining assistants/therefore
no checks . were used in making pay
ments, i
' Hamilton went into an explanation
of the reasons for organizing this con
fidential service, as he characterized
It, covering lils methods of work and
citing a number of legislative bills in
which he had been interested. A. list
of expenses from 1899 to 1904 was ap
pended to the statement. The sum of
$235,000 unaccounted for, he says,
would be greatly reduced by his run
ning account, which still is unsettled
and open, and. as a matter of good
faith pending a settlement, he offers
to deposit $100,000 with the company.
WORK REQUIRED SECRECY.
Hamilton says that he has no checks
to produce, adding:
Payment by my chepk would necessarily have
disclosed the fact that the persons receiving
the check was under retainer by me and would
thus hayÂ« necessarily hampered that portion
of my work that was most efficacious, namely,
absolute secrecy. Cash, drafts and certlflcatss
were generally preferred.,. .
Hamilton gives along summary of
the various styles of hold-up measures
or bills hostile to insurance companies,
many of them taxation measures. He
says: . ;\u25a0. ~i : fy
Bfils to compel the companies' reports to bÂ«
repeatedly and unnecessarily published in news
papers are advocated to gain favor with tho
press for increasing their revenues. Outragro
oua propositions, such as tne 10 per cent tax
proposed in Arkansas, or abEurd propositions
like the Michigan bill, where a doctor's cer
tificate of Hi health would excuse the payment
of the Insurance premium and keep a policy In
force; or the Virginia bill, making it action
able for a life Insurance ugent to enter the of
fice of a man where the sign "No Agents Al
lowed" is displayed, find legislative favor.
However ridiculous these bills may seem, they
demand attention.
\u25a0 In Indiana the attempt wm made to \u25a0 pass a
law placing the surrender value of a life insur-i
ance policy "upon the list of personal â¢ property
which was taxable to the owner. Companies
which offered no such advantages to policy
holders supported . It as an attack upoD their
rivals who offered this advantage. ! The meas
ure, however, was defeated. Immediately ihe
Btate Assessors proceeded to tax policy holders,
proclaiming that the existing law was broad
enough in its terms to cover this. If this was
true of Indiana, it was probably true of many
other States in the Union. The New -York Life
Company, through my department, retained
eminent and Influential counsel and succeeded
by a divided court In | defeating the. project.
Following out this idea developed in Indiana, .
several States, notably Arkansas, Introduced
similar measures, all of which were defeated.
At the capital of every State we have either
retailed representatives of the companies or
acted in co-operation with some one who has
retained representatives duly influential." It has
been found advisable, as the result of experi
ence, to avoid as far as possible any exact ;
public conclusion as to who represents us. The
known presence of a corporation representative
at legislative halls is the signal for Â« renewed
vigor in the attacks of blackmailers and cranks,
and unfortunately, members of the legislative
body are frequently deaf to reasoning where a
non- voting or corporate interest is at ; stake.
Prevention is again proved herein to be better
than cure.
. Where It becomes, necessary we have often
occasion to employ the columns of the press for
a discreet advocacy of our views. This method
has been found to be very efficacious, but it
has. also been found to be very expensive.
lIOXEST MEX IN LEGISLATURES.
' I have found in my work that li every legis
lative body in the United States there was as
large a proportion of honest men as there Is Ist
any body of men in any walk of life. Permit
me also to state that in my work I have not
found it so difficult to dereat blackmailers. A
man who is out to blackmail : corporations is
generally well known and his character thor
oughly understood. These men never; retain
influence for any length of time, : and I have
found that requests to the j honest j members of
th* Legislature for help In defeating the black
mailers is always readily and cheerfully
granted. i '\u25a0
Hamilton sets forth that the tax meas
ures alone defeated by him have saved
the New York Life Insurance Company
moTe than . $2,500,000. In concluding his
statement he says that ''the Injunctions
of the president of the New York Life to
me were always unmistakably; explicit
that my expenditures and work were, to
be strictly. confined within the limitations
of the law of the land. These instruc
tions, have been 'faithfully followed ' to
the letter."
Secretary McCall : was questioned -by
Hughes as to what further .light he could
throw on the statement of Hamilton, but
said he could give no information. He
did not question Hamilton's figures nor
the large amounts for traveling expenses.
He asked Hamilton for a \u25a0 full statement
and relied on ;his honesty â to explain
everything. He did Insist that Hamilton
produce checks or check books, but Ham
ilton taid he had none... . \u25a0
LIE IS PASSED AT INQUIRY.
: When McCall was "excused Henry D.
Appleton of the State Insurance Depart
ment was! called., He completed ' his testi
mony'begun ; last- Friday, and during j the
exa mination was ; f told â¢'. that *l Morgan,
former president of the = Bankers' Life

Appleton said It would cost 'the Bankers'

said:-.- - - â¢\u25a0\u25a0'-;\u25a0.\u25a0(\u25a0-." ' \u25a0â¢ '.
~ "It Mr. Morgan said that he Is a'- liar."
Louis F. Payne, former Superintendent
of 'Insurance of the State" of New York;
was called to the stand and explained a
large number of j appointments of conn-,
dential examiners on the ground that an
unusual number, of' examinations were
made during "his term of office. Hughes
produced a-list which showed that 4n_lS97.
two examinations were made and in IS9S
two more ' were made, while in 1893, the
last year of Payne's administration, the
number; had not been brought out when

READY TO INTERVENE
Vice President Caceres Is
Called Upon to Assume
Control of the Country
WASHINGTON, -Dec .27â- -The Navy
Department has received a cablegram
from Commander.' Chambers of the
Nashville, . dated at Puerto Plata, last
night, ; stntlnur that he bad' been In
formed from, a '.Government \u25a0 source
that President Morales had been shot
and seriously: wounded.*'- '.^ "*":

marine guard for 'such service as con*
riitioiiM may require.." Tne 'Dixie y wlll

squadron detailed for service In those
waters. * . , '
The Navy Department . to-day re
ceived a brief dispatch from Puerto
Plata. Santo Domingo, announcing the
departure .from that port for Monte
Christl of the gunboat Dubuque. No
details of her mission have not yet been
received.
The gunboat Paducah left Norfolk
to-day for Monte Christ!.-. The Navy
Department has advised Rear .Admiral
Bradford of her departure and that she
will be at hia disposal as soon 1 as she
arrives in Dominican waters. The Pa
ducah is a sister ship to the Dubuque
and "will 'be attached to the squadron
guarding American interests in tho
West Indies. \u25a0
The State" Department to-day received
by; cable from Santo Domingo advices
which threw much needed light upon the
revolutionary disturbances reported from
there yesterday.. These were to the ef
fect that the diplomatic corps had been
notified by the .Dominican Minister for
Foreign Affairs, General Tejera, that .
President Morales having abandoned the
capital, leaving the Government without
an acting head, the Cabinet had called
upon the Vice President, General Caceres,
to take-charse pending the temporary
failure of Morales to exercise his func
tions. ' Caceres Is known to favor the'
American , receivership. '.' The city of San
Domingo was quiet and the Cabinet offi
cers were exercising their functions with
out interruption".
General Caceres is -understood to be at
Puerto Plata and as the Clyde Line
steamship Cherokee. with Captain Colton,
the controller of customs, aboard, is due
to touch at that port to-day, it is under
stood that .he- will , take passage imme
diately for San Domingo City, almost
two. days distant. â¢Â»â¢
As the situation is understood here there
has been no actual change in the domi
nant party in Santo Domingo as the re
sult of Morales' abandonment. The fact
is the party known as Horacla, of which
General Â» Caceres, the Vice President," is
the principal figure, has .all along.con
trolled the Cabinet, and this Cabinet, in
turn, owing to the peculiarity of the Do
.minicun constitution, has completely dom
inated the Presidential office. As Morales
was ambitious to conduct his own Go v-.
ernment, he fell under' suspicion of dis
loyalty tg his ; party, and also. .was sus
pected of intending to join the opposi
tion, or Jiminez party. .; Finding himself'
without power, because, the Cabinet con
trolled the party. Morales anticipated re
moval by the party leaders and fled to
the revolutionists, with the intention of
securing a sufficient force to re-enter the
capital and drive out his enemies.
It is generally admitted that if re
quired marines will be landed to protect
the lives of Collector George R. Colton
and his two American assistants. -Wheth-.
er such a protection would be extended
to his Dominican assistants was left in
doubt. Another positive statement made
was that the administration would in no
way work toward the resoratlon of Mo
rales.

mine, was struck on the head by v. fall-
Ing rock, the blow fracturing the skull

age he engaged in mining, becoming
one of the best known mining men In
the country. Fifteen years ago he re
moved to Nevada. where he resided In
Virginia City. He remained In that
State for seven years and 3hortly after
his return to California he accepted the
position of superintendent of the Raw
hide mine, which he held at the time
of his death.
The deceased leaves four children,
his wife having passed away two years
ago. All the members of his family re

FORUM CLUB
HOLDS AUCTION
JUST FOR FUN
The Forum Club waxed gay yester
day afternoon, when it became the col
lective guest of the retiring president,
Mrs. Frank Fredericks.
The clubrooms at Slitter street and
Grant avenue were Kay with holly and
huckleberry, when the full Quota of the
club was received by Mrs. Fredericks, as
sisted by Miss Isabel Vail, Miss Sadie
Fitch, Miss Hendy and Miss Judson, all
smartly gowned and fetching.
Just what was going to happen was a
dark, dank secret, until Auctioneer Cur
tis arrivedâ the only man admittedâ who
proceeded to inspect a pUe of packages
Then the secret was out.
Presently the auction was on, and It
was not long before reckless plungingâ to
the tune of fifty beansâ had wrought the
usually decorous club Into a veritable
"pit."
When the packages were opened, great
was the fun thereat, for each one con
tained a witty allusion and a weird gift.
" During the afternoon, Mrs. Newton J.
Tharp, unquestionably one of the clever
est readers in town, gave some interpreta
tions in capital style, followed by Mi3s
Dunn upon the piano.
A bo^rl of Â«Â«Â«nogâ superbly Â»<uiÂ«oÂ«*Â«Â»Â»
was served in lieu of the Ã¼biquitous tea.
whose odor hangs heavy in every woman's
clubrooms. .
Should the awful fact leak out that a
woman's club had fed real eggnog tÂ» Its
friends It might itart some Innocent
clergyman or some ex-president to talk
ing upon the degeneracy of clubwomen,
and their headlong flight to inebriety and
ribaldry. _

FOSTER THE
BOYCOTTING
They Are Now Charged With
Instigating the Feeling
of Hostility That Is
Spreading Over Country
SITUATION GROWING
FAR MORE SERIOUS
Chinese Buy Australian
Flour, Paying More Than
What the American Pro
duct Is Offered For
Aocordins to business men who arrived
here from the Orient yesterday on the
liner Ccptic the anti -American boycott In
China, although maintained less ojÂ»nly,
1s growing' In scope and strength and
may before long develop Into a general
antl-forelgn demonstration. America's
business In China has decreased in volume
at least four-fifths, and is still diminish
ing. The Japanese are son openly
credited with being: the Instigators of
the boycott, and It is generally be
rllrved that while the American news
paper* were, Cuuruilvrb, patting the
Japanese on the back the little brown
men were laying mine* for the ob
literation of American's trade with
China.
The Standard Oil Company, the Sperry
Flour Company and the American Tobac
co Company have been the heaviest losers
by the boycott. These concerns represent
S limitless capital and powerful influence,
hut in spite of all their efforts to stem
the tide of opposition four-flfths of their
trade in the Chinese market has been
swept away. Australia and Canada have
benefited to a considerable degree by
America's loss, but the principal bene
ficiary, say the people who arrived on the
Coptic will be Japan just as soon as she
Is In a position for commercial expansion.
Of all who returned on the Coptic no
body is in a better position to speak with
authority than Robert Van Sant. who
since the boycott was inaugurated has
been stationed at Shanghai as the repre
sentative of Getz Bros. Van Sant believes
the boycott situation to be. more serious
than ever, and declares himself as satis
fied that the whole business was en
gineered by the Japanese. Van Sant says
that the Chinese merchants axe opposed
to the boycott, had no hand In starting
It and would welcome & return .to the j
farmer friendly trade relations. They are
losing money in handling many of the
products of other foreign nations and to
day In the strongest boycott centers are
buying American goods when they can
do so surreptitiously. The boycott is be
ing enforced less openly, says Van Sant,
but the anti-Americaji forces are now so
well organized that they can do even
more effective work la comparative se
crecy. â - . - :.-Â«~->-.: .-Â«~->-.-
BOYCOTT IS GENERAL.
The boycott Is In etrong evidence, de
clares Van Sant, In seventeen of the
eighteen provinces Into which Ohina Is di
vided. In some of the more remote places,
where the Ignorance of the natives makes
it difficult for them to distinguish Amer
ican from other alien products, everything
foreign falls under the ban. All over
China, he says, natives long educated in
the comforts of lamplight have aban
doned the use of Mr. Rockefeller's lllu
minant and now lighten their darkness
\u25a0with English-manufactured candles.
The American Consul at Nankin is out
of oil and unable to replenish his supply.
He ordered a email shipment of the
Standard's best, but the boycott commit
tee persuaded the coolies that it would
not be good for their health to handle It.
"That was some months ago," said Van
Sant. "and as far as I know the oil has
not been delivered yet."
Van Sant declares that the representa
tives of other nations are helping the
boycott along in every way they can in
the hope that America's loss will be their
pain. This is true particularly, he says,
of the people interested In furthering the
interests of Canada and Australia,
"I asked one of the boycott agitators,"
said Van Sant, "why they had selected
America as the sole target for their op
position, when both Canada and Austra
lia barred out Chinese."
" "Wait awhile,' he replied, 'their turn
will come.' "
Van Sant not only believes the boycott
to be more serious than ever, but thinks i
there Is ground for fearing it will develop
Into a general anti-foreign agitation,
which it will take years to overcome.*".;!
DEMANDS INCREASED. V
"When the boycott began," he said, "all
the Chinese asked was better treatment
for Chinese visitors to the United States.
In response to this President Roosevelt
Issued orders to the immigration officials
to exercise more leniency and greater
courtesy in administering the exclusion
laws. ThÂ» Chinese took this as an evi
dence of weakness, and instead of taking
off the boycott tightened the screws and
demanded a modification of the terms of
the exclusion act."
During the last few months, says Van)
Sant, Chinese merchants have been buy- j
ing Australian flour and paying more for j
It than the price at which the American j
product was offered.
In the southern part of China repre
sentatives of American firms have been
holding meetings with the boycott leaders j
in the hope of reaching some ground on j
which a settlement of the trouble could
be made. But there, as everywhere else, I
the* real source of the dissatisfaction
eludes the searchers.
All Investigation, Van Sant declares,
leads to but one conclusion â that behind
the boycott is something foreign to any
thing ever known in China before. ' and
that that something Is Japanese Influence
rxerted with all the subtlety of Oriental
cunning, but all-powerful as the hosts of

ST. PETERSBURG, Dec. 27.' 11:36 p. m.
There Is no further news from. Moscow
to-night. A press correspondent there
succeeded in getting the St. Petersburg
bureau by telephone this evening, but he
had only uttered the words:. "I am going
to tell you a horrible story," .when he
was cut off. Since then nothing has been
heard from the correspondent. â¢ ! .<i
The Seminov6ky regiment of guards
was dispatched to Moscow by train to
night. This is considered rather ominous.
According to information received by
the revolutionary leaders here, an armed
rebellion on a large scale has been planned
in Poland. The Socialist revolutionaries,
encouraged by the success of the insur
gents in the Baltic provinces and by the
situation at Moscow and In Russia gen
erally, have decided that the moment has
come to try to cast off the yoke of auto
cracy. The tactics to be followed are the
same as those adopted at Moscow, the
rising to be preceded by a general strike,
which has already come into operation,
bringing all the railroads in Poland to a
standstill.
An open rebellionin Poland would Im
mensely complicate 'the situation' for the
Government, for If it should gain enough
headway to warrant reasonable hope of
success it probably would draw on the
entire population and the Government
would practically have to reconquer the
country-

T UI\A FOR THE CHINESE."
Grorrlngr Hostility to Foreigners In
Flowery Kingdom.
PEKING, Dec. 27. â The most conser
vative and best informed foreigners
agree In expressing apprehension at
the constantly growing irritation of
the Chinese against foreigners, which
for nine months has been gradually
spreading through the country. "China
for the Chinese" summarizes the ob
jects of the movement, among the chief
promoters of which are male students
educated abroad' and new newspapers
conducted by Chinese who have been
educated in America and Europe.
These 'papers are beginning: to gain
great influence. '
The anti-American boycott has been
followed by a ' discussion of China's
wrongs at the hands of foreigners
generally an d a determination to re
dress them. â¢ The hostility shown
against Americans has spread to all
foreigners. The Chinese are pleased at
the result of the boycott In producing
conciliatory orders : from President
Roosevelt, but the boycott is not ended
and, It Is asserted here, continues se
riously to affect American trade In the
Canton and Yangtze regions.
The Chinese are so satisfied with th*
movement that they are talking of the
boycott as a permanent weapon for the
national armory. - The newspapers ad
vocate the boycott of Indian opium be
cause of the action of the British as
sessor of the mixed court at Shanghai
in ordering the Imprisonment of Chi
nese women in the municipal: jail in
stead of- in the Chinese prison, which
caused the recent disturbance there.
The result of the present
Is to discourage concession hunting.
The Government has adopted a policy
of Chinese control of railroads, mines
and similar enterprises, and refuses to
grant new concessions and is trying to
regain or annul several concessions
previously granted. While many, for
eigners sympathize with the objects of
the agitation, they realize the danger
of Inflammatory speeches and articles
in the newspapers leading to mob up
risings like that at Shanghai and the
recent massacre of American mission
aries at Liienchau.
There le no doubt that the aggressive
spirit of the Chinese lias been decidedly
increased by the late war and the suc
cessful maneuvers of the Chinese
northern army in October. Japan's
victory has encouraged to Chinese to
believe that they could be equally suc
cessful. ;

SLAUGHTER
IN MOSCOW
Casualties Will Reach Fif
teen Thousand and the
Struggle for Possession of
the City Is Not Yet Ended
GENERAL MISTCHENKO
HAS NARROW ESCAPE
Famous Cossack Leader Al
most Captured by Revolu
tionists on the Outskirts
' of the Ancient Capital
ST. PETERSBURG, Dec.,.- 27.â The
Slovo declares it has learned that the
bloodshed at Moscow is frightful and
that the casualties will' reach 15,000.
About. : 100 Red Cros"s workers have
been dispatched from St. Petersburg to
Moscow to aid In caring: for the
wounded. The paper" says it has
learned that the arms of the revolu-
tionists mostly came from Germany
and Belgium, whence they were
shipped to England, transhipped
there' and smuggled into Russia
through- Finland and the Baltic prov
inces. Continuing, the Slovo remarks:
"When our plenipotentiary sought to
prevent the sailing- of these vessels,
through the Consuls, the latter re
fused to â¢ act, as all . the vessels flew
foreign; flags." ...
In spite of the bad prospects here
the leaders of the revolutionists are
continuing their desperate efforts ;' to
bring:, on; a' general conflict.. At'Khark
off. yesterday the flag of armed revolt
\u25a0was .raTsed, but. according to. reports
the. troops, which had been largely re
inforced, put down the outbreak mer
cilessly^ The members of the so-called
provisional composed "of
twenty-two delegates, which had been
' sitting; there, were- captured early In
I the day, and later when the red- flag
was raised, and barricades were erect
ed around the Helf rich Engine -Works,
.which farmed revolutionists were- hold
ing, cannon were brought up, and the
revolutionists were given ten .minutes
In which to surrender. They sent out
an emissary,! who was ' seized by the
military commander, who then ' gavts
the command to the artillery to open
lire on the works, which were liter
ally, battered down over the heads: of
the revolutionists. J The .... latter., al
though r unable to make a defense, held
'out^until; three-Quarters of their num
ber were killed or wounded, when the
remnant, '127 men,'* surrendered.
MISTCHEXKO ALMOST CAPTURED.
Lieutenant General Mistchenko, who
commanded a Cossack brigade in Man
churia 'during the Russo-Japanese
war, had a narrow escape from, cap
ture .by, the revolutionists at St. An
drew's monastery on the outskirts of
Moscow, where the railroad track was
blocked by barricades of freight and
passenger-cars. The general and two
members of his staff managed to get a
sleigh and reached' Moscow by mak
ing a wide detour, but fifty officers
returning from -Manchuria, who were
left behind, were captured and forced
to give up their arms. They begged
to- beallowed to keep the gold swords
given them for bravery, but the revo
lutionists refused their reauest.
Minor collisions] between the troops and
strikers, of whom there are almost 50,000
still outdare taking place constantly In
St.* Petersburg. Cossack patrols, are
charging and dispersing workmen when
ever they ' collect. The most serious af
fairs occurred at the Narva gate and on
the *Molka \u25a0, canal, in which fifty persons
were killed or wounded. Automatic guns
have been mounted on the bridge over the
Fontanka canal. . from which they can
sweep: the" Nevsky' prospect in j either j di
rection and also both ways of the canal.
The battery is inclosed in a â¢ collapsible
Bhed in order not to attract too much at
tention.
GUERRILLA WARFARE IN* MOSCOW.
A" brief message from Moscow telling of
to-day's events says that troops with ar
tillery are pouring into the city, but that
the Situation- has not greatly changed.
The ; revolutionists hold portions of the
Moscow-Kazan road.
'Desultory firing is taking place. The
military patrols are engaged in guerrilla
warfare with the revolutionists, who are
seeking refuge on? the. roofs of houses
and; in the narrow. thoroughfares. ''
.Following; the example of the authori
ties at; Moscow.\ about; half the police of
St. Petersburg are now armed with rifles,
and the unwonted spectacle of policemen
with bayonets on their rifles adds to the
public alarm.
.The news from the provinces 'to-day
showed an alarming extension of the
, strike. Koknov, a fortress town of Lithu
ania '- having about '" 80,000 . Inhabitants,
, seems absolutely in the hands of tne So
cialists, who have summoned the people
to an' armed rising, and the situation is
so serious ; at : Krementchug, South . Rus

The situation Is really far. more serious

Mrs. Fltzsimmons arrived on Mon
day and went, to the Cataract Hotel*
which has housed maay, famous di

to the register and suoceeded in con
cealing her Identity for two days. Her
manner led to the surmise that ah*
was seeking- a divorce, and thia sus
picion was confirmed to-day when she
was seen in consultation with a law
yer.
In response to a direct inquiry Â»h \u25a0*
then, acknowledged her Identity and
frankly avowed that she was there
for the purpose of obtaining a divorce.
She was accompanied by no one, not
even a maid. A white Spits dog,

Mr. Fitzsimmons cannot prove any

Although Mrs. Fltzsimmons denied
that the outcome of her husband's

When asked if he would stop over to

AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION
THEME OF DISCUSSION.
Before a session of the' State Farmers' Institute and members of the Teachers' Association

opinion that elementary instruction in this line was a failure, but where imparted to
more mature pupils it was a great success. .-.â " <:

President Wheeler Shows
Opposition to Study
of the Farm.
BERKELEY, Dec. 27.â Mistakes that
jere made or have been made by the
"mends of agricultural education formed
the subject of L. D. Harvey's address be
iore tfie Joint session of the State Karra
e:s" Institute ar.d the nature study de
. partmeiu of the Teachers' Association
ihis morning in Hearst Hall. Mr. Harvey
is director of the Stcut Training School
et ilenoinince. Wis.. a brilliantly success
ful '.institution, where agricultural educa
tion is given to tho3e who have passed
the age for elementary instruction.
FMr. Harvey declared that one method,
end only one. of imparting agricultural
education In the schools lias been stamped
â¢ with the hallmark of success, and this
" method is simply the formation of classes
*nnde up of tnose who have passed the
grammar school period and yet have not
entered the high school period of their in
struction. Such pupils, instructed by
trained and enthusiastic teachers, show
the fruits of such instruction ir. ways
that spoil profit for themselves and ben
efit to the State or county or district that
makes itself responsible for the instruc
tion. All other methods, Mr. Harvey de
â¢ clared. have proven unsatisfactory- {
\u25a0 ' President Benjamin Ide Wheeler greet
ed the joint session of teachers and farm
en when they assembled. He suggested;
that in the matter of introducing agricul
tural education into the schools of the
country it would perhaps bÂ« well to go
eiow. Tho subject is a comparatively new
â¢ one, he declared, and the exact body of
: - knowledge to be taught is undetermined
lor unknown. There are no charts to
"guide, end so the steps should be taken
jvhh unusual care.
. â¢ *lr. Harvey then read his paper on the
subject. "Experiments in Agricultural Ed
'â¢'.mation in This and Other Countriesâ
* What They Should Teach Us."
â¢ He said he agreed with President Wheel
. er in the advice to "go slow." His paper
\iaÂ« in part as follows:
I have seen many failures Jn the teaching
â¢ of agriculture in public schools, and pjwially
:**!n Nebraska. Minnesota and Wisconsin. I
' know tbat-tt Is difficult to give such instruc
. Â»tlon in district Bchools because of the lack of
â¢ pupils of sufficient maturity to comprehend the
.instruction offered. 1 had a man in Wisconsin
Â« \lslt eighteen schools and only twelve children
over 12 > fare old were found. | Then. too.
:arroers are not educated to see the value of
â¢this teaching, and Â«o It fai'.Â«. Also, the lark
Of trained teachers if a big drawback, and al-
B-.ort always will be Â«ure to epell .failure for
agricultural instruction. '
Consider Canada. la 1872, by mandate of
the minister in. charge of educational matters,
agricultural education was ordered instituted
in all schools. The result has been a com
plete failure, *o far as elementary Instruction
Is concerned, though the work was done under
the. fiirecttoa of a skillful teacher. Professor
Robertson. Ireland in IST" devised a law to
Institute such instruction. Later a commission
investigated and reported, recommending that
the Idea be disapproved. France had a similar
\u2666xperler.ee. I served on a Jury that awarded
rot-dais at the Bfc l^ouls fair and with me was
a Belgian gentleman who said the idea had
;>-.;:\u25a0 d in Belgium.
Understand. I s*peak now simply of Â«le
ireritary instruction. On the other hand, where
Â» t-i iouituiel education has been imparted to
more mature pupils by trained teachers, it has
lÂ«"Â«i greatly successful. Norway has forty
two such fchoole, and Sweden, with a popula
tion of 5,000,000. ha* eighty-six such achodls.
Denmark also has many, and they are suc
cessful; "
Dr. A. C. True of the agricultural de
. â¢partment of Washington led in the dis
csjsslon of Mr. Harvey's paper, the dis
. russlon also being participated in by
* Lr-roy Anderson, director of the Poly
technic School at San Luis Obispo; State
.Pcnator G. R. Lukens and E. F. Adams.
The latter suggested that In order to
provide trained teachers for agricultural
. education candidates for teachers' cer
tificates be required to pass examinations
â¢ In matters relating to agriculture.
At the afternoon session of the Farm

LIBRARY WORK
IS SUBJECT OF
DISCUSSION
BERKELEY. Dec. 27. â Students of library
work and those who for various reasons have
special interest In the problems that pertain
to the art of the skilled librarian gathered
thiÂ« morning in the First Unitarian Church
of Berkeley when the Library Association of
CaJifornia he!d its annual session. Although
the attendance was not large the interest dis
played -in the papers read was intense and
the discussion that followed the presentation
of library subjects was spirited throughout.
Joy Ljchtensteln of San Francisco, presi
dent of the- association, was in charge of the
pos>lon. Mlas Minerva Waterman of Santa
Cruz served as vice president and Miss Anna
L. Sawyer of Santa Cruz as secretary.
Professor Elwood P. Cubberley of the de
partment of education at Stanford University
was the first speaker, his paper being a
thoughtful presentation of the , important sub
ject, "The Relation fThat the State Library
Should Bear ,Xo the \u25a0 Rural Schools of Cali
fornia." The paper was long; but was listened
to with deepest interest, and the discussion
that followed was instructive. J. H. â¢ Acker
man. Slate Superintendent of Instruction. Ore
gon, ied the discussion. He was able to.pre
eect the view point of an official who.*? prob
lems are somewhat different from those of
California librarians or school officials - and
this tact added .to the value of his brief
speech. The discussion was participated in
also by ' James L. Gillls, librarian of the State
Library at Sacramento and by Daniel H.
White. School Superintendent of Solano County.
There was a general discussion of the sub
ject then a recess of fifteen > minutes.
The teachers' and the librarians' point of
view with regard to the important subject of
attracting interest in good reading and of lead
ing- children to read good books was presented
by representatives of both school teachers an<2
librarians.
The librarian's view of the subject was
discussed by Mrs. Ai!ee O. Whltbeck, librarian
of the children's department of the Berkeley
publio library. The teacher's idea of the mat
ter was \u25a0 set forth by P. W. Kaufman, City
Superintendent of Schools of Pomona. Tha
discussion of the subject was led by Miss M.

Liquor Sellers of Berkeley
Left to Wonder What Is
to Be- Their Exact End
ALL MAY BE AKKESTED
No Provision for Bridging
Gap, During Which None
Will Have Legal License
BERKELEY, Deo. 27.â Twenty-three
saloon-keepers; in West and South
Berkeley are wondering to-day Just
what their status is to be after Jan
uary 1, andthe Trustees of the town
are also mildly concerned in the out
come of thelr^ unusual action lastnight,'
by which the question of selecting ten
out of "the twenty-three dealerV to be
given licenses was postponed until the
next meeting, two weeks from now.
/The liquor licenses of all the saloon
men In Berkeley expire on January 1.
The Trustees ,have not renewed any of
them. They 'will not renew or grant
any until January 8. What will be the
status of all the saloon men between
January 1 and January 8? They will
have no licenses.; Will they close?
Will the Town Marshal arrest them for
doing. business without a license?
The predicament is the result of the
failure on the part of the authorities
to comply with all the provisions of the
law by which the awarding' of liquor
licenses is regulated. The' law requires
that. an application for license must be
filed with the Town Clerk ten days be
fore it Is considered' by the Trustees.
J. H. Jones, among others, was awarded
a license last night and when all the
baHotlng was over It was found that
Jones had failed to file his application
within the specified ten days.
Also it was discovered that the
Trustees had acted hastily In awarding
the licenses without complying wi.th
the provision which requires that ap
plications be referred to a committee.

DETECTIVE LETS
PRISONER FLEE
POINT RICHMOND. Dec. 27.â While
under guard last night of a private de
tective, Minjojima. a Japanese, charged
with the theft of moneys from the Bank
of Yokohama, In Japan, escaped. The
fugitive had been arrested at Fresno. He
was taken. to Point Richmond to be held
there in . concealment until the next
steamer sails for Japan, the bank officials
fearing that the man's friends might in
voke successful habeas corpus proceed
ings before -he could be placed outside
the Jurisdiction of the courts.
According to the story related, by tho
police "at' Point* "Richmond, the fugitive
was employed as a clerk In the Yokohama
bank. It was desired that Minjojima
should learn something about American
customs, so, through .the influence of his
brother, he was sent to this country and
installed In a branch of the bank at Saa
Francisco. Shortly after the departure
from Yokohama the defalcation was dis
covered. "Word was cabled to San Fran
cisco, but by some means or another the
new "arrival received information of the
discovery in time to flee. .Private de
tectives were put on his trail and they
traced the man to Fresno, where he was
taken Into custody. He was given over
to Detective Darr last night and Instruc
tions were given to keep a close watch
over the . prisoner. But Darr. believing
his man secure, lapsed during the night
and his ward disappeared.
Manager Hodsumi of the branch bank
was. seen by a Call representative last
night. He said the defalcation was very
small . and that ' the bank was fully pro
tected by surety arrangements in Japan.
Mr. Hodsuml's bank will not prosecute
the defaulter here, even If he Is found.

NEW YORK. Dec 27.â For tha prtvllega
of owning Its own fÂ«rry to Staten Island
the city .of New York ia paying more than
1500 a day, that being the daily excess of
expenses over receipts In the seven weeks
since the city took control. From OctobÂ«r
25 to Decembers the total expenses were
$107,358 and the receipts J75.400. This leaves
a loss of 525.955. or $336 a day for the fifty

necessitating three shifts Instead of two.
are chiefly responsible for the deficit.
Thus far the number of passengers car
ried since the city assumed control has
averaged 23,033 a day. As the city did
not begin operating the ferry until after
the excursion season was over. It la be
lieved that this average will be largely
Increased for the year, because of the In

SOUTH END FOLK EXULT
OVER LOSS OF PEST.
HE GETS SIX MONTHS
Reward of Stealing Yacht and Beaching
It When Tired of Cruising on Bay.
JAMES C. CRAWFORD
With mainsail hsllied and pennant
a-flutter the swift yacht Spray was
found beached at Anderson's shipyard,
South San Francleco, after her master,
A. W. Hall, had spent three days In
futile endeavor to ascertain her where
abouts. Her nose was deeply Im
bedded in the mud, indicating that she
had been steered ashore, head-on, and
under full sail pressure. Investigation
led to the disclosure that her anchor
and the chain attaohed thereto were
missing.
The Spray had disappeared from the
spot where ehe was discovered and
simultaneously there faded from public
view one Fred Miller, a thriftless youth,
whose pseudonym of "the village cut
up" was earned by his penchant for
playing mischievous, not to say ma
licious, pranks at the expense of his
neighbors in the South End, many of
whom substituted the noun "pest" for
that of "cut-up" when they voiced his
sobriquet. It was only reasonable
therefore that when Skipper Hall
learned of Master Miller's disappear
ance he opined that boy and boat had
departed together, nor wasjt remark
able that .his opinion was shared by
every person who had fallen victim to
the lad's love of practical joking.
"Without wishin' any ill luck to you,
cap'n," said one of his hearers, "I won't
be eorry if he runs her on a rock an"
is drowned, 'f'r he's a derned noosance."
While the captain did not express ap
proval of that wish, his demeanor made
it evident that he could gladly hail
Master Miller's demise by any means
t*at would not Involve the wrecking
of the Spray.
After the yacht was found no diffi
culty was encountered in effecting the
arrest of Master Miller on Captain
Hall's complaint of malicious mischief,
for the young man's usual haunts were
well known to all who desired his re
moval from the vicinage. When ar
raigned before Police Judge Mogan he
had no defense to offer, save a remark
that the anchor and chain were acci
dentally lost and neither willfully cast
away nor stolen by him, as the prose
cution had surmised. He was sentenced
t& six months' Imprisonment and a
large delegation from South San Fran
cisco openly exulted.
It was corridor gossip that during
his three days' voyage on the yacht
Master Miller visited almost every port
on the bay and whlled away his sailing
hours .by lying upon â¢ his back and
loudly singing the* refrain of a popular
nautical song, which real mariners
never sing, the opening line of which
is.* "Sailin*. sailin*, over the boundin'
main." Rumor had it also that he
beached the boat because his limited
ken of seamanship prevented him get
ting ashore by any^- other means so
promising of safety.
Charles A. Smith, a sand teamster, ob
structed passenger car traffic on Bay
street for twenty-six consecutive min
utes by keeping his wagon at a standstill
on the track, despite the pleading and
objurgations of an ever-increasing army
of conductors and gripmen, whose respec
tive vehicles were compelled to stop and
thus shatter their time schedule.
In defense of his conduct Mr. Smith
told Judge Cabaniss that one of. the
wheels of his wagon stuck between a
rail and a rock and that when he re
quested the assembled conductors and
gripmen and chafing passengers to assist
in releasing the obstacle they showered
vituperation upon him.
R, Thompson, a car Inspector for the
United Railroads, testified that the only
abusive language Indulged in was by Mr.
Smith himself, he having said to Hans
Peterson, a gripman, "I'll knock some of
the corners off that,, square head of
yours."
For obstructing the street can Mr.
Smith was fined $10. and an additional
charge of peace disturbance was dis
missed. . - k

Mrs. M. Morgenstern. a buxom matron
residing at 110 Olive street, tearfully told
Judge Conlan that Edward Ford, a swart
and stalwart young man whom she had
"tried to mother," proved an lngrate by
stealing her purse, containing $11, and
also her baby's savings bank.
"Why did you do it?" his Honor asked
the defendant.
"Because I> asked her for money and
she wouldn't let m* have it," was the
surly reply. \u25a0 :\u25a0";'\u25a0 .0
"What right did you have to expect her
to give you money?" the Judge pursued.
"I'd rather not go Into that question,"
was the answer.
Wlien the same query was addressed to
Mrs. Morgenstern she sobblngly muttered
\u2666"^at she had "tried to mother him," and
ncr husband, a kindly faced little man,
echoed her explanation.
"Well., the Sheriff will father him for
the next six months,"- said the court.,' .^
When the 6ullen prisoner was returned
to the cage Mrs. Mbrgenstern. still weep
ing, thrust her hands between the bars
and grasped his hands and held whis
pered converse with him.
He was booked as Frederick J.Â« Rich
ards, but he confidentially informed Judge
Frit* that the name was assumed, as ' he
was a prominent business man in Oak
land and did not desire to have his ac
quaintances twit him on the fact that he
was arrested for drunkenness and disor
derly behavior in the San, Francisco red
light district at 1 o'clock yesterday morn
ing. As he spoke he nervously fondled
his sldewhiskers, and when the Judge or
dered his dismissal hÂ» tied from the court
with bowed head and great precipitancy.
Judge Mogan saw the futility of at
tempting to stop Mrs. Abraham Cohen's

Cornfield, Journeyman carpenter, of hav
ing defrauded him out of honestly earned
wages to the amount of $15, and, incident
ally, of having disturbed- the peace by re
fusing to pay said sum.
Mrs. Cohen's unsolicited pleading was
in advocacy of her husband's cause, of
course, and ran the gamut of forensic
variety, ranging from most scathing in
vective to tender appeal. Nor was she
discriminative in her selection of persons
to address. When the Judge avoided her
eye she transferred it to Clerk Gray, then
to Stenographer Long, then to the immo
bile countenance of Bailiff Hickey, and
finally to the tittering assemblage of
chair-warmers. Her vocal organism was
unimpaired when the case was disposed

John Wilson, middle-aged, decently
garbed and bearded like a pard (whatever
that may be), menacingly brandished a
revolver in George Spiro's restaurant, 12
HayÂ«s street, for which he was arrested
and booked for assault with a deadly
weapon. After hearing the testimony,
however, Judge Mogan ordered that the
complaint be amended to read, "exhibit
ing a deadly weapon in a rude and threat
ening manner," and the revised charge
will be heard next Friday. .
A combination of Mr. Spiro's clumsiness,
and Mr. Wilson's whiskers was alleged
to have led to the pistol play. Mr. Wil
son had ordered eggs, soft-scrambled,
and Mr. Bplro took the order and also de
livered it, but in the process of delivery
his foot slipped, or his elbow was jog
gled, the result being that the dish of
mixed-up eggs was deposited upon Mr.
Wilson's facial appendage. Instead of
upon the' table. Endeavoring to claw the
yellow mass from Its nestling place, but
actually digging it more deeply therein,
Mr. Wilson angrily demanded of Mr.
Splro what In thunderâ or something Â©lse
â he meant by his' 1 awkwardness, nor
â¢would he stay his harangue to listen to
apologetic explanation. Eventually the
Â»torÂ« of Mr. Spiro's patience became ex
hausted, and he, too, waxed angrry.
Mr. Wilson avers he did not draw his
shooting iron until his head had been vio
lently tapped by a coffee-cup in one of
Mr. Spiro's hands, but Mr. Spiro declares
he had never so much as spoken harshly,
much less committed assault, when he
was both astonished and frightened by
Mr. Wilson's sudden display of firearms.

vated when he appeared in court.

PORTLAND. Dec. 27.â The Oregon

which it has been announced may
amount to about 25 per cent - of the

states that the commission claims a

possession of the corporation after all
liabilities have been settled. The Ore

accounting of the money which has
been expended by the corporation. The
communication states that the commis

the Attorney General of the State of
Oregon.
The officials of the corporation say
that the action of the Oregon State
commission is absolutely without pre

to the stockholders they say they are
only following a precedent which was.
established years ago by other exposi

The one exception to the general
rule was the Chicago Fair, when the
city appropriated a certain amount.
The surplus was divided between the
stockholders and the city pro rata. But
the officials say that there was a pre

they allege, does not exist Between the

. Filed at Sacramento to Prevent
FosNlble Annexation.
SACRAMENTO. Dec. 27.â The light

Wilmington, which' he filed with Sec
retary of State C. E. Curry.
Senator Savage left Los Angeles, last
night at 5 o'clock and reached Tracy
at 6:10 this , morning. He had pre
viously ordered a special train to be
in readiness for him at the latter place
in order to reach Secretary Curry's of
fice ahead of a rival who was gup
posed to be armed with papers show
ing that -Wilmington, including its
waterfront, has. been annexed to Long
Beach. Up . to noon Savage's rival had
not reached this city, so ,far as could
be ascertained, and no papers of an
nexation had been filed In the office
of the Secretary of State.
A bitter fight has been waged, it ap
pears, between the people of Wilming
ton and Long Beach, the former re
sisting strenuously the attempt of the.
latter to absorb it.
SHIPWRECKED SAILOR LIVES

\u25a0â¢ Port Simason.
VICTORIA, B. C, Dec. 27.â News was
brought by the steamship Tees from
Northern British Columbia of the
Crusoe-like adventure of S. A. Lund
berg, a Norwegian, who was cast away
a month ago. from a sloop. ln which he
was voyaging from Portland Canal to
Kitamat. . The sloop was wrecked on
Pearse- Island, near Port Simpson, and
the seaman spent three weeks on the
island, living on clams. He hoisted dis
tress signals on a tree by day and
built fires by night, endeavoring .vain
ly to attract attention, and finally,bullt
a raft, on which he reached Port Wil
son, fifteen miles away, after a most
trying voyage,- in which he narrowly
escaped being washed from his raft.
He was finally picked up by the Tees and
taken to Hartley Bay.
The- Tees also brought news of a
large part of Mount Peni, at Grabble
Island, falling into a! lake at Surf In
let. Some miners who arrived by the
steamship Just. passed the scene of the
landslide, .which they say caused
waves like walls of water. They be
lieve volcanic action caused a portion
of the moutnain to slide into the lake.

BARK BATTERED
BY MANY GALES
Heda Arrives From Manila,
After Weathering Sportive
Typhoons and a, Hurricane
HULL BADLY STRAINED
Liner Coptic, With Heavy
Shipment of Eaw Silk,
Comes From the Orient
The bark Hecla. Captain Nelson, arrived
yesterday morning from Manila, after
one of the stormiest voyages a sailing
. versel ever weathered. She Is bound for
' Port Townsend, but put In here for new
sails and to make some necessary repairs.
â¢ The Hecla left Manila on October 20.
Ten days after leaving the Philippine
" port, when off the coast of Luzon, a "ty
phoon was encountered. For the next
fony days the Hecla was blown from one
.typhoon into another. She weathered
them all, but was a very disreputable-
Ibokir.g windjainmer by the time the last
one got through with her. Her sails had
been blown Into rags and even the cop
per Fhcaihing had been torn from her
slides and bottom. Her stem was dam
aged and havoc more or less sericus had
been wrought on deck.
The weather behaved decently after
this, until December 18, in 43 north. 140
west, when a hurricane from the south
east ar.d southwest was encountered.
There was a high cross-sea, in which the
. Hecla was thrown on her beam. ends. In
this storm the vessel's hull was seriously
t-trained, and she was leaking yesterday
when she came into port.
The Hecla left Manila for Port Town
send for orders. It is likely that she will
be thoroughly overhauled and repaired at
this port before she again puts to sea.
Coptic Ajrive* From Orient.
The Occidental and Oriental Steamship Com-
T-ar.y's liner Coptic. Captain William Finch,
arrived yesterday afternoon from the Orient.
_ She brought a valuable cargo and seventy
five passengers. She reached Quarantine about
4*.30 and was given quick dispatch fey Federal
doctors and custom-house officials, but did not
get aloÃgÂ£)4e the wharf until after 7 o'clock.
The tide was low and to reach her berth
â¢ the Coptic had to squeeze her way through a
mud bank, which proved slow work.
- The vessel* cargo included nearly 1000 bales
of nw silk, worth about $750,000. She brought
altogether 13T4 tons of freight.
Amoss the passengers was Jules Brunet.
an official in the office of the MinÂ»s*er of
Foreign Affairs in Belgium. Accompanied by
Ferdinand and Arnould F"ocquet. he has betn
'inspecting Belgium's railroad interests la the
Orient. Rene Halewyck. the Belgian CocÂ»ul
St this port, went out o"n the Golden Gate to
nÂ«t his distinguished feUcw countrymen.
Captain Charles Berlin of the French army
was another passenger. He was with the
Japanese forces during the war and says that
the stories of the damage done to the town
<aT Moukden were greatly exaggerated.
Fine weathrr wag encountered throughout the
voyage. The passengers included:

Mramer Oakland Runs A Tray.
The Southern Pacific ferry steamer Oakland
r^n away from Captain McKechnie as she
was approaching this side about 10 o'clock
yesterday ir.ornir.g and going at full speed
Fh<> drove her nope through several hundred
dollars' worth of pile* at the ferry slip. Paa^
ser.gers were thrown down by the Jar and the
preatest excitement prevailed for a time. On
Tuesday the Garden City took the bit in her
mouth and tried to butt the Alameda depot
farther up the mole. The Jar wrecked the
Gazden City'n bar and restaurant, but the
vessel escaped with a few scratches. The
Oakland did mere damage to the wharf and
will herself need considerable repairing. Cap
tain McKechnie is said to have overlooked
Ot slow bell until too latp to avoid a smash.
Both accidents will be investigated by the
Federal inspectors of steam vessels, who, at
this port, have always been most exacting la
requiring the skillful handling of vessels car
rying passengers and punishing all careless
ness.
Tlaa Hard Time Dockioc
Tfce Elicits Reef yghtshJp. which came Into
.port the other day as the result of having
Tjreken away from her moorings, docked yes
terday at the bulkhead between Mission street
wharves 1 end 2. The lightship has no tele
irraph !rom bridge to engine-room and passing
orders by word of mouth made the operation
of docking a difficult undertaking. From
\u25a0wharf to wharf the lightship bumped. She
knocked a lot of gingerbread work from th-Â»
tug Pilot and so jarred Beadle Bros.' office as
she caromed against the building that the
clerical force deserted in a. body and stood
on th* wharf pointing their pens menacingly
at Captain Quinton. who finally worked his
unwieldy charge to the bulkhead, where he
tied her us-
QnfÂ«n Has Siormy Trip.
The Pacific Coast Steamship Company' a
Queen errlxed yesterday afternoon from Puget
Sound after one of the roughest trips Bhe
has experienced this winter. The heaviest
weather was experienced on Christmas day.
Captain Cousins could neither Etop the ship
nor quiet the seap. but he did the next best
thing. He ordered the postponement of the
"Christmas dinner until the next day, when,
in quu-ter waters, the passengers were In

MORMONS MAY
NOT BE LANDED
Four Children From New
I Zealand Are Ordered Back
Because of Their Faith
STRANGE OFFICIAL ACT
When Inspectors Learn That
Youths' Escort Believes in
Polygamy Bars Are Eaised
The Oceanic Steamship Company was
held to answer yesterday by United
States Commissioner HeacocK in the ac
tion brought against it by the United
States District Attorney to. recover a fine
of $1200 for the alleged unlawful landing
of fcur children who arrived from Auck
land, New Zealand, on May 8, 1905. The
children- were Emma A. Harding, aged
11 years; Robert G. Harding, seven; Wil
liam ,G. Harding, five, and Charles G.
Harding, nine. They were accompanied
by and in charge of Rev. J. H. W. Goff.
a Mormon missionary, returning from
New Zealand.
Mr. Gofl said that the mother of the
childern was dencl and that the father
had sent them witrr Mr. Goft to be placed
In charge of a relative named Charles
Stephens at Bennington, Idaho. Mr. Gofl
said that he had $50 to pay the expenses
of the children to that place, and that
their father would follow shortly. The
fact that Mr. Goff was a Mormon preju
diced the Immigration officers against the
new arrivals, and under the pretext that
the children were not accompanied by a
relative or a legal guardian, and might
become a charpre upon the State, ordered
them deported. An appeal was taken and
a rehearing granted, but the sentence
of deportation was affirmed.
In tr-e meantime friends put up bonds
with the steamship company to guarantee
that the immigrants would not become
public charges, and the children were al
lowed by the steamship officials to pro
ceed to Benninfton.
Nathan Frank and W. Ford Thomas
represented the steamship company before
the Commissioner. It developed that
United States Immigrant Inspectors D. J.
Griffiths and Antonio de la Torre did not
know whether the children were in the
United States or not. All that they could
say was that they were not deported on
the same steamer that brought them.
For a reason, probably intimately con
nected with the denial of a landing to
the children, the immigration officials
closely questioned Missionary Goff as to
his religious belief. He replied to one
question that he believed in the institu
tion of polygamy. It was shortly after
this declaration that the children were
ordered deported.
SUPPOSED DEAD .MAX MAKES
VISIT TO CORONER'S OFFICE
T. D. McGarvey, Mlnslng Carpenter,
Wants It Known That He Is Sot
Thomns A. Ilardlnc
T. D. McGarvey walked into the Cor
oner's office yesterday afternoon in an
inebriated condition and in a husky
voice demanded to know why it had
been reported that his body was at
the Morgue. - Deputy Coroner Meehan
took hftn to police headquarters and
he was sent to the City Prison by
Captain Burnett till he should be so
ber and his friends could take .care of
him -- \u25a0 "
McGarvey is a carpenter and had
been missing for about four weeks.
His friends had notified the police, but
no trace of him could be found. It
was .supposed that he was the man
who was brought from Santa Barbara
on December 19 and died at the City
and County Hospital on December 25.
That supposition, was published yes
terday and had the effect of bringing
McGarvey to the Coroner's office. He
had been on a steady "drunk" for four
weeks.
The dead man was identified as Thomas
A. Harding, as previously announced, who
waa sent by M. H. Cutting of 635 Wash
ington Btreet .on December 2 to Monterey
to work for the Monterey Lime Company.
He was a stowaway on the steamer New
ark and inhaled the fumes of gasoline,
which caused his death.
GIVES STRONG TESTIMONY
IN SUPPORT OF CODICIL
Hand writ Ins Expert Kinsley TelU of
Cbnracterintlcji ot Davis' Pen- y"
maushlp. i
Wljliam J. Kinsley, the expert who
has. been giving some strong testimony
In favor of. the proponents in the Sam
uel Davia codicil contest, took the
stand in Judge Kerrigan's branch of
the Superior Court yesterday and told
a. story of capital Ks. Kinsley said
that after a long and careful exam
ination of the known Davis handwrit
ing he had found that the dead capi
talist was In the habit of making four
distinct styles of capital Ks. He fur
ther testified that he had found all of
these Ks in the codicil. Basing his
statement and argument on this, the
expert said:
"We could not ask for a better proof
of tho genuineness of the disputed In
strument. I have had a great deal of
experience with forgers and their
methods. I have never found one who
will put himself to any more trouble
or to: any greater disadvantage than
can be helped. Here Is a case where,
if the instrument had been forged, the
writer would have selected one of the
KÂ» used by. Davis and used it, con
tinually throughout the forgery. It Is
quite unreasonable to suppose that any
but Davis himself would have used all
four of the Ks which we find in his
admitted writings."

Privates in the 9 Seventieth
Company of Coast Artil
'levy'Take Dose of Opium
SUICIDES AEE FEEQUENT
Five ITen of the Same Corps
Make Attempt at Self-
Destruction Within a Year
Two more attempts at suicide were ac
credited to the Seventieth Company of
Coast Artillery Tuesday evening, when
Privates Vern Nelson and Harry Staley
tried to end their lives in the attic of the
company's barracks at the Presidio by
taking opium. These two men bring the
list of suicides for this company up to
five within less than a year, the last one
being Private John Mitchell, who swal
lowed carbolic acid on a Union street car
on December* 13.
Nelson and Staley have always been
close friends. They returned from the
city after a prolonged Christmas spree.
They climbed into the attic of the bar
racks and there it is supposed agreed to
die together. Several privates about the
building saw them going into the attic,
and when they did not come down an in
vestigation was made and both men were
found unconscious. They were taken to
the general hospital, where they will
probably recover.
Lieutenant William B. Renzlehausen of
the Fourth Cavalry, stationed in the Yo
semite Valley, Is being tried by a general
court-martial at the Presidio on a charge
of absence without leave. It is stated
that the lieutenant was absent from his
post at "Wawona for several days, and
upon his return a worded combat took
place between himself and his command
ing officer, with the result that charges
were preferred against him- Should he be
convicted he will probably be sentenced
to a public reprimand. . v\
The Twenty-fourth Infantry (colored)
arrived at the Presfdlo yesterday and
took up quarters in the Tennessee camp.
The regiment will sail for the Philippines
on January 25, and is the first colored
regiment which has been detailed for for
eign service for nearly five years.
Brigadier General D. Stuart Gordon, re
tired, is in the city from Washington. D.
C, and will spend the winter here. Gen
eral Gordon was stationed at the Presidio
over thirty-five years ago and planned
many improvements for the post at that
time.

Cbicasw Official*, Like Others, Prove
(.cable to Cope With Amateur
Question.
CHICAGO. Dec. 27. â All amateur
boxing matches, sparring contests,
put?ilis*ic tournaments and every va
riety of thenetic art is to be prohib
ited* in Chicago after to-night. This
will apply to the Chicago Athletic As
sociation, where weekly boxing enter
tainments have been given; the Illi
nois Athletic Club, where monthly
iimateur tournaments have been held,
and all other organizations in the city,
whether large or small.
The conditions surrounding the ama
teur tournaments oi the Illinois Club
for the past two nights have caused
the new order, which Chief of Police
Collins declared to-night was final and
meant the end of all boxing exhibi
tions in Chicago. The final contests
in the present tournament of the Il
linois Club, scheduled to be decided
to-morrow night, cannot take place.
Inability to regulate the contests
â¢without discrimination and partiality,
and the fact that various organiza
tions attempted to take undue advan
tage of the privilege given them, is re
sponsible for the ban being placed on
the pugilists. Professional pugilists
have been called "amateur boxing ar
tists" to evade interference and "ward
robe charges" and a dozen other sub
terfuges have been used by many of
the athletic clubs to get around the
order prohibiting an admission fee.

The final match was close and interest-

back court strokes being; the feature.
Miss Meaxns and Miss Vodden were
steadier than their opponents, and to
this they owe their victory. The score
â¢was 6â2,6 â 2, S â 6, 7â6.7 â 6.
In the first round Miss Mearns and

THREE MEMPHIS
BANKS COLLAPSE
Merchants' Trust Company
and Two Allied Concerns
in the Hands of Receiver
MEMPHIS. Term.. Dec .27. â Three
banking Institutions failed to open
their doors for business to-day. The
Merchants' Trust Company, with a
capital stock of $200,000: the Ameri
can Savings Bank and Trust Company,
and the Mechanics' Savings Bank,
smaller institutions, allied with the
first named concern, have gone into
liquidation. A receiver has taken
charge.
The cause of the suspension of the
Merchants' Trust Company is said to
have been over-loans on discounts.
One of the directors said to a repre
sentative of the press that the three
institutions had ample assets and
would pay dollar for dollar.
The Merchants' Trust Company re
cently absorbed the Memphis National
Bank, and, It is stated, owns the con
trolling stock of the American Sav
ings Bank and Trust Company. This
institution recently absorbed the Me
chanics' Savings Bank. The suspen
sion of the three institutions caused
little excitement in financial circles.
It was stated to-day that the suspen
sion of the Mechanics' Savings Bank is
only temporary, and that its affairs are in
good shape. Officers say that the suspen
sion was decided upon because they
feared a run when the doors were opened
this morning, the public generally being
aware of the bank's relation to the Mer
chants* Trust Company.
A condensed statement of the condition
of the Merchants' Trust Company at the
close of business December 26 was given
out as follows:
"Total assets, $3,665,055; indebtedness of
every character to depositors, $2,132,319;
all other obligations, exclusive of capital
stock, $589,058: cash actually on band,
$30,000."
C. W. Schulte, president of the Mem
phis Clearing-house Association, made
the following statement in behalf of the
association:
"Fifteen dayÃ ago the Merchants' Trust
Company applied for help to the Memphis
Clearing-house Association. The Clearing
house Association appointed a committee
to investigate the matter. The commit
tee went over the assets of the Mer
chants' Trust Company as carefully as
the limited time allowed, and the associa
tion advanced the sum of $160,000.
"Subsequent investigation revealed the
fact that while it was the opinion of the
Memphis Clearing-house Association that
the depositors of the concern are safe, yet
it would take an extraordinarily large
sum to pay all the demands. In the
interests of the city and the depositors
and of the various institutions of the city
which for the last month have anticipated
some such . movement, it was deemed
wisest to allow the concern to close its
doora."
Major G. M. McÃae, president of the
Memphis Savings Bank, said:
"I believe the liquidation to be the re
eult of taking on too much business by
the Merchants' Trust Company, too much
spreading out and too large advances in
purchasing other propertiea." â¢.
NEW YORK, Dec. 27.â According to a
recent statement, the Merchants' Trust
Company of Memphis, Term., owed de
positors $605,000. The American Savings
Bank and Trust Company of Memphis,
Term., according to a" recent statement,
owed depositors $625,000.
Mate Wanted for Battery.
j. h. Rex, watchman ! at the Simp
son* lumber yard, obtalried a warrant
from Police Judge Mogan yesterday
for the arrest of Charles Bloom.- mate
of the schooner Churchill, on a charge
of battery. Rex said he had a quar
rel with Bloom for transgressing the
rules of the lumber yard and on
Christmas morning Bloom lay In wait
for him and struck him several times.

ALBERT FIR A 30 TO 1 OUTSIDER
DEFEATS SOME FAST MUDLARKS
Adams Lands Yo San Winner of the Opening
Event, Quoted at Odds of 12 to 1. .
Barney Schreiber'sTvyo- Year-Old Dr. Gardner
Given a Strong Argument by Ramus. :
FRED E. MULHOLLAND
There was a great deal of discussion as
to the relative merits of Pinkerton and
Princess Titanla, two starters In 1 the con-:
eluding: race on the menu yesterday at :
Ingleside. Plnkerton* 1 ruled favorite when
the event rolled along, and' the mare" on- j
joyed second call. Hot air was passed out
down the line, and even the dockers com
manded respectful attention when con
; suited.
i For a time It looked as ; If there might
be a genuine old-fashioned horse race,
for some sectional I feeling : cropped to \u25a0 the
surface. Neither one finished among the
first three.
Albert Fir, a 30 to 1 shot, piloted by Le
roy Williams, nosed out St. George Jr.,
with Magrane, another outsider, a bang
up third. Plnkerton led to the stretch be
fore resigning, while Princess Titanla met
with the poorest sort of racing luck.
ADAMS LAXDSYO SAJT.
Form was well maintained in the mud-,
dy going, three favorites earning brack
ets. A large crowd viewed the racing.
Yo San, a 12 to 1 shot, ridden by Ad
ams, captured the opening sprint. The
mare- was tiring perceptibly at the finish,
but lasted long enough to beat Barney
Schreiber's Angleta, the second choice, a
length. Sad Sam, backed down to 6 to 5
favoritism, displayed none of his speed of
bygone days, losing the show to Blumen
thal. Masedo made-no showing at all in
the sloppy going.
Just like stealing, it, the smart set said,
when S to 5 was chalked against Dr.
Gardner in the betting on the seven-fur
long two-year-old number. Radtke lifted
the Doctor across the line first, but .the
finish was so close that many thought
Ramus might be awarded the verdict. The
books laid 10 to 1 about â¢ the latter, and
Treubel made the youngster run the race
of his career. Tenordale once again ran
third. ;\u25a0 J
PROCRASTINATE A WINNER.
Radtke followed this up by winning the
six-furlong selling affair with Procrasti
nate, the 11 to 5 favorite. The gelding
easily outf ooted Mrs. Bob, defeating the
filly in a gallop at the wire. Old Jerry
Hunt took the show.
Looking to outclass his field shoes to
plates, Gateway annexed the mile and a
sixteenth selling fixture without an effort.
A heavy play forced the price of the
brown gelding from twos to 3 to 2, and he
was breezing In front of Bannock Belle
and Christine A passing the wire. Gloomy
Gus, a highly touted one, receded half a
point in the betting and made a ragged
showing. ; . vI ;V >"â¢
Buchanan, an' 11 to 20 chance, ran third
in the mile-and-twenty-yard run, and
Cloche dOr, a 12 to 1 shot, winning, gave
the books a new lease of life. The favor
ite made' all the running and then, fading
away to a whisper, was beaten a neck
and a noee. There developed a terrific
play on Warte Nicht. which finished sec
ond, and while Bock did the best he could
an older hand might have done better.
NOTES OP THE TRACK.
Radtke piloted two winners, was
; twice second and once third.
â¢ T. A. Davies was so impressed with
Ed Sheridan when he beat Possart on
Tuesday that he bought the brown
gelding from Barney Schrelber yester
day.
Starter Holtman's assistants will be
at the Oakland track Monday. Wednes
day and Friday mornings, between 5
and 10 to school yearlings, and dally
at Ingleside from 12 to 1 p. m.
Half a dozen of the Christmas book
makers failed to toe the mark yester
day, leaving twenty-five firms to cut
In. Some of the feather-welght3 will
no doubt be on hand again next Sat
urday.
Bookmaker Joe Blume. his brother
Sam, Thomas Harmon and Frank Moo
ney, all \u25a0 well-known New j Yorkers,
were visitors at Ingleside yesterday.
The association) has offered a purse
of $3500 for a special" at one and a
(sixteenth miles, to be run on Wednes
day, January 10, 1906. It is designed
to bring 1 together Bearcatcher, Proper,
Callaghan, Dr. Leggo, Neva Lee, San
Nicolas, Lubln and Eugenia Burch.
The latter mare is in training at Ascot
Park, Los Angeles, and stands out as
the best piece of racing hardware
cfown there. Handicapper Horace Eg
bert alloted the following weights
yesterday, which are Subject to change
after the handicap to be decided on
New Year's day:

Presiding Judge- Hamilton of Ascot
Park wired the New California Jockey
Club yesterday that, the horses owned
by? " Diamond Joe" Costen. and adver- .
tised'to be sold, at auction, would.be
reinstated if the sales were bona fide ;
ones. The Los Angeles official added,
however, that none of the horses
would ever be allowed to race over
Ascot Park. Oh, very well, Judge, per
haps big Ed Corrlgan 'will receive
them at New Orleans.
As the horses of Joseph Costen were
not I reinstated ; since being ruled off at
Ascot Park lalst season. " they will not
be allowed to be sold at Ingleside' to
day. Orders were also Issued by the
New California Jockey Club officials to
remove them from the grounds.
If L. Williams, W. Smith and two or
three other riders that ; could be named
were fined about $50 it's dollars to
doughnuts they would be able to keep
their mounts going just as straight as
Radtke does. i

THE TEACHERS' ASSOCIATION.
HOLIDAY week is given over to great activity in the State
University at Berkeley, by the meeting there of the State
Teachers' Association in its thirty-ninth annual session, and
the concurrent assemblage of the State Farmers' Institute, the^ State
Library Association, the School Board convention and a section of
the Geological Society of America. Valuable and interesting papers
jwill be read and discussed, upon a great variety of subjects, per
taining to the material- welfare of our people and their educational
interests!'
The promoters of agricultural education will improve the oc
casion by a forcible showing in favor of introducing agriculture into
the curriculum of the public schools. About'this there is a great
diversity of opinion. If such education attempt to go further than
chemistry of the soil, plant life and growth and diseases and ene
mies, it will add to the already topheavy course of study a burden
too great for teachers and students. There is no question, however,
that very much that is now in the curriculum can with advantage
be taken out to be replaced by an extension of nature Study into the
field of agriculture proper, and its projection into forestry as an
important collateral.
We think that a study of agriculture, if finally adopted, should
be made selective and not compulsory. It is just as impossible to
make an agriculturist of every man as it is to make all singers or
orators. When the natural taste and tendency are present, agricul
ture as an optional study will be selected. When they are lacking
it will do harm instead of good if made an obligatory branch of edu
cation. In our technical schools we have the same principle of op
lion and selection in study of the mechanic arts. Every pupil can
not be made a carpenter, blacksmith, machinist, draughtsman, a
mechanical or electrical engineer, in the absence of a taste for either
or any of those vocations.
By making agriculture and the laws of plant life an optional
study, there is no doubt that we will be educating the* coming and
much needed vegetable physiologists and pathologists, upon whom
much of the future welfare of agriculture is to depend. We have
now a well organized profession of animal pathology and treatment
of the diseases of our domestic animals, which are intimately related
to- successful agriculture. The epizootics which attack cattle, sheep
and swine and often cause great loss are constantly studied and
remedied. But plant diseases and deterioration are not so well un
der control, for lack of trained men in that field, and the losses they
cause annually run into the hundreds of millions.
Besides these subjects others relating to standard pedagogy will
occupy the attention of the teachers during the week. They will
add to their professional equipment and zeal, and interest in their
vocation will be inspired. But the teachers are compelled to do this
at a sacrifice, which, while it does them honor, they should not be
compelled to make. Since a little past midsummer they have had
the nerve racking of the classroom upon them. They have stood for
most of each week in loco parentis to the children of the State, and
for quite inadequate compensation have carried the burden of fitting
the next generation for the duties of active life and the burdens of
citizenship, while the rest of us have worked in our several ways,
but always free of the trying responsibility they bear. Now at the
'loliday season, in the holiday week, whpn everybody else is putting
:are aside and letting into their lives that variety that changes the
.ension of their nerves and rests them for taking up the burdens of
v Jie new year, these teachers are compelled to use their holidays
>y pressing forward in the same old line of their daily toil, with no
jew subject, no new object of interest, and denied even the social
mjoyments which culminate at this time of the year. Out of their
"lender compensation, at a time of many and unusual demands aris
ing in family affection and friendly esteem, they must take the cost
of a trip away from home and maintenance among strangers.
Their sacrifice is great and if possible it should be avoided. No
)nc denies the merit and benefit of these meetings of their State as
sociation, but it is ill-timed when it occupies the holiday week and
deprives them of the joys of life, which are for everybody but them.
It makes the school year a steady strain in one direction, with no
relief, no change, no novelty. Perhaps it cannot be avoided, but it
ought to be. â¢
A RAILROAD IN THE PARK.
r T^HE city is startled by a proposition, originating in the new
I Board of Supervisors, to run the Geary-street railroad through
Golden Gate Park. This is supposed to be in the interest of the
people of the Sunset district. But the park belongs to all the people.
It is incompatible with the idea. and purpose of parks that ordinary
streets and railroads shall be run through them. If the Sunset dis
trict is entitled'' to a .purely commercial facility in the park, all of
its borders have the same right and its' enforcement means the dis
appearance of the park.
Like a great many other defacing and despoiling propositions,
this proposed vandalism impinges upon public ownership. The city
is to take over the Geary-street road. The city can send that road
across the park.- It can also turn the park into a cow pasture if it
choose, or rent it to timber cutters and sell the stumpage. It can
do a lot of things that ought not to be done, in the name of public
ownership/unless the courts can successfully arrest its spoliations,
which remains to be seen when the proposition becomes official.
Since the park was developed all street roads have been prop
erly excluded from it, as they are excluded from parks in every city.
The beautiful and symmetrical development of a park is impossible
under any other conditions. The new Board of Supervisors will do
itself credit by extending our system of parks, excluding from them
ordinary streets and railroads, and giving the people more such
breathing and pleasure places, rather than abridging what we have
in Golden Gate, the finest park in the. world.
AGAINST SOCIALISM.
"T"*HE Saturday Evening Post, sometimes, gives signs of recur
j rence to the homely philosophy of its founder, Ben Franklin.
x Noting the rapid progress of socialism in cities and its slow
headway in the country, the Post says: "To the man who lives in
a great city and looks at the things around him, it must often appear
that the ideals expressed in the constitution have -utterly lost their
force, and that the population is divided into classes whose interests
are sharply antagonistic. But if he will go into the country, par
ticularly into the great* grain raising country of the Middle West;
he will find democracy pretty triumphant still, sitting on a load, of
corn and innocent of any idea that John, the banker, is a plutocrat, or
Hank and Tom, hired men, proletarians who ought to hate him.
Farmer, banker and Hired men go to the same wedding and the
same funeral.". ... *
It was Jefferson's belief that the mainstay and support of our
free institutions would be found always in the rural population,
living on and from the lrnd. He regarded cities with aversion, and
called them the "cloaca," the sewers of the country. Though money
flows to great cities, wealth remains and increases in. the rural dis
tricts. The Secretary of Agriculture estimates that the daily in
crease in the value of farms for the last five years has been $3,
400,000. That wealth, won by hard work, in the face of wind and
weather, is the rear bulwark of democracy. Socialism may divide
the personal estate, consisting of money in the cities, but the real
estate, the farms of the country, will not be in the pool. \u25a0 .

DOES IT PAY TO BE GOOD?
A Few Reflections on theXase of Mrs. W. Ellis Corey
Versus Actress Mabelle Gilman. ' ; ri *V
ANGELA MORGAN
DOES wifely devotion pay', Does
goodness pay? â¢ \u25a0
The pessimists have their oppor
tunity now to point out the case of Mrs.
W. Ellis Corey and cry that faithfulness
and unselfishness have no reward.
The skeptics have their chance to con
trast the lot of the faithful wife with
that of the young woman alleged to have
broken up her home, and to ask: "What
of the divine : justice that.w ould permit
vanity and unscrupulousness to win out
against loyalty, unselfishness and true
womanliness?"
The case of the Coreys and the numer
ous similar cases which . have attracted
public attention recently are' calculated
to shake . the faith of many women who
are struggling patiently with hard prob
lems In the belief that character
more than anything else in this world.
The patient, careworn wife reads the
story and wonders whether, after all,
sacrifice and patlencfe and genuine love
avail much in this life. .
The self-supporting woman,, out in the
world, surrounded by temptations and
striving to be true to her best Ideals, re
flects bitterly upon facts which seem to
show unprincipled womanhood triumph-
Ing over virtuous womanhood, and ques
tions if, after all, she may not be fighting
a losing battle.
And yet, In the light of the world's in
telligent thought, which ,of these two
women, the deserted wife or the. favored
actress. Is really the unfortunate one?
The first stands before the world an
object, seemingly, of pity; sorrowful, hu
miliated, crushed; cast off by thÂ© hus
band she has loved through years of self
sacrifice and beautiful devotionâ her ""hus
band and the father of her children.
The second woman stands as one who
has triumphed. Young, pretty, possessed
of charms : that , have so Infatuated the
steel magnate he is willing to give up
wife, home and children for her sake, this
actress, according to * superficial judg
ment, has Infinitely the advantage of the
wife.
But, thanks to the divine justice which
truly does exist, jit Is not on the visible
side of life that judgments may be made.
It is only in the Invisible realmâ where
each one of us really 'livesâ that values
may be truly taken.
Thus It Is that not one of us, looking
upon external signs alone, can judge
what is good fortune and what calamity.
If, as Is . aliened, this actress, .because
of her vanity, her love of power, her
greed for money, has robbed another
woman of her husband,~it Is she, 1 and not
the wife, who has drawn the; real calam
ity. No matter what exalted^ position she
may in future â¢ occupy; no matter what
triumphs, what praise, flattery or sue-
NO INDORSEMENT.

PLAYING THE PIPER.
cess may come to her, she has brought
disaster upon herself, and, sooner or later,
she will realize' It.
She has connected 'with forces that are
bound some day to prove her undoing.
The woman who is capable, for her
own selfish purposes, of deliberately
breaking up a sister woman's home, can
not be called fortunate in any real sense,
no matter what . external good fortune
may come to her.
To be possessed of a dwarfed soul, a
sordid nature, a stunted understanding
that' knows no recognition of another's
rights, another's sufferings, Is not
fortunate.
To have such a distorted view of life
that winning a man from his wife seems j
an achievement of which to be proud,
rather than ashamed, is not fortunate.
To lack moral sense, humanity, woman
liness-Â«lndeed, to lack all the genuine
traits that really' make life worth the ,
livingâ ls not fortunate.
What is-- this . young woman's achieve- .
ment, after all? Why not class it In the'
category where It belongs? Is It any more
to be proud of than \ the achievement of ;
the burglar, the bank thief, the highway
man? All these take by trickery, clever- !
ness or, force the things that do not be
long to them.
The most blessed thing in life is the
consciousness of being right. Mrs. Corey,
deserted and unhappy though she Is,
does possess this consciousness. She has
done her part. She has wronged no one.
She A has been loyal, patient, self-sacri
ficing, noble. â¢
She has the respect, the sympathy, the
admiration of every worthy person In
this land. On her side, are all the forces
of rizht and truth.
Yes, there is a divine justice; there is
a divine law; and. that law operates co
perfectly that one . who harms another
for her own gain is robbed of the capacity
for, real happiness.' â''

THE 3IAN AND THE VENERABLE.
A MAN who was having a little New-

which promised to be a fairly red

person who carried a scythe upon his

"Ah, there, Reuben!" the man re
marked. "How ia the alfalfa?"
But before the venerable person had
time to answer a funeral cortege
passed down the street. ** .
"Who is the party in the rest

"That Is the body of the Old Year,

For the venerable person had no
ticed that the man was acting In a pe

"Picking up a stone."
"For what?"
"To shy at the wagon. I want
to show what I think of the Old Year.
"Did it treat you badly?"
<i "Badly! I should say It did â never

"Did you help It do so?" \u25a0-"
"Well, Iâ lâ that Isâ l attended to

festal procession is that behind the
other?"
For the man thought it would be
well to change the subject.
"That is the procession of the New

"â¢Tis,. hey! 'Ray! -' Ray for the New

"Why do you think so much of the
New Yearr";
"Why, he has promised me all sorts
of good things."
"Say," the venerable person with
the scythe- remarked, "I will tell you
one thing right now: He will keep
few or none of his promises so long

The man listened in wonder and
amaze. Then he shook his head and
said:
"I suppose then it must be one of
your children I am out after."
"What do you mean?"
"Why, I am out after a little Time."
So Old Father* Time passed on. for
what Is the use of giving counsel to a
fellow of that kind? Pearls cast be
fore swine are wasted â unless some
other fellow picks them up.

"Well, I can't figure out whether he

GLANCES INTO
WORKSHOPS
OF WRITERS
The promise that Ainslee's Magazine
makes that it will be a very Interesting
periodical for the year 1&06 is so solidly
backed up by the mention of the names
of the writers who are to be its contribu
tors that really there Is no need for any
but the brief prospectus in which it has
announced who are the people who will
collaborate in its expected excellence. -
Here are some of them: Edith tVhar
ton, perhaps rightly, heads the list. As
she has recently scored a brilliant suc
cess the people will be sure to wish to
read more of her work. Then there is
Booth Tarkington, who did the "Beautiful
Lady." and more recently the "Conquest
of Canaan"; Katherine C. Thurston, that
talented Irish authoress, whose three suc
ceasrul novels are a prediction of more
good stories to come; Edgar Saltus, whose
name suggests attic salt and a saltant lit?
erary style sure to arouse attention and
entertainment; the Baroness yon Hutton;
Julia Gordon; David Graham Phillips,
with his hand on the pulse of people who
are getting rich too fast; Rex E. Beach,
the vlriUst; Jack London, the portrayer
of tho elemental in man's make-up; Ella
Wheeler Wilcox, the white-thought com
forter: Allan Dale, who does theatrical
matters: the divine Barah Bernhardt;
aiid Maurice Maeterlinck, who is almost
divine. There are others, not to be
thought slighted, though not in this brief.
The plan which Ainslee's has laid out
for itself would be a most stimulating
Ideal for people in all lines of endeavor
to keep Â«et up before their desks or in
the -mind's eye, namely: to take each
issue, "not as a standard to be equaled
by the next: but as a finished achieve
ment to bo excelled." However, that's a
thing which it is futile to expect any
ertort to mak<s infallible. There is for
ever the swing of fortune's wheel, and
flukes will always happen. We will hope
that Ainslee's will almost always catch
surely on to the next higher notch in the
ratchet of ascent.

"There Â«re three ways of writing
plays," said Augustus Thomas, as he
helped himself to a round of well-browned
toast. "The j first kind of writer starts
with a story he can get anywhereâ it need
not necessarily be his ownâ and then he
sets to work to give life to that story-
The second kind of writer is one who con
ceive?, finds or conceives a very strong
situation, and writes up to that and down
from it. The third type is the one who
starts with a set of characters or with
one character, and lets them work out
their own story."
"And which type of man are you?"
asked the Interviewer.
"The third," he replied. â¢ â¢ â¢ I begin
with a group of characters and let them
live together for a while, and they make
their own story. â¢ â¢ â¢ I haven't thought
how it will work outâ they develop their
own story, you see. Under these condi
tions if a man tried to bind his charac
ters by conventions they would smell of
the theater."â The Theater.
The passing of the eagerness to put
sculpture in the parksâ if it may be said
to have really passedâ means no lessening
of its prominence in cities. Indeed, that
must be expected to increase as the new
ideal of civic splendor strengthens its hold
on our American imagination. And what
a nationally typical beneficence, by the
way, was that contained in the will of
that Chicago lumberman, recently de
ceased, who left $1,000,000 of which the In
come is to be used for "the erection and
maintenance of statues and monuments
in the public places, in the parks and
elong the boulevards" of Chicago! It is
typically American in the magnitude of
its sum, in its generous open-handedness,
in its whole-souled but somewhat bar
baric attitude toward art, as if the donor
had said: "Art is a good thing in cities,
is it? Well, here's a million. Buy a line
and spread it around."â The Architectural

STARTS FIGHT
FOR RAILROAD
Corporation Averse to Sur
rendering Geary 3 Street
Line to the 3liinicipaiity
SUES FOR INJUNCTION
Asserts That Steps Taken
by Officials Are Contrary
to the. Legal Provisions
Determined, to prevent, if possible, the
acquisition of the Geary-street Railway
by the! municipality, the stockholders of
the corporation now operating the line
havo Joined in an assault upon the legal
ity of the procedure of the: Board : of
Supervisors through which ' the will "of a
majority of the people of the city was to
be accomplished. ; .
Suit to perpetually ' enjoin the officials
of the municipality from expending any
portion of the sum of $350,000 â¢ set aside
in tho budget for the acquisition of the
road was filed yesterday by the stock
holders, who are represented as plaintiff
in the suit by Isaac Straesburger, who
pleads that bis interest, as a taxpayer,
in the proper expenditure of municipal
funds has spurred him to tha action
taken. No financial Interest in the fate of
the corporation that passes into history
with the acquisition by the city of the
road Is admitted by the nominal plaintiff,
but to defend his rights as a taxpayer
he has called to his aid John Garber, the
latter* s partners, Ctesswell & Garber,
George W. Lane and J. D. Lederman. '
PURPOSE OF ACTION.
While the validity of the entire scheme
for the acquisition of the Geary-street
road by the municipality Is attacked in
the suit, the immediate purpose of the
action in to prevent the purchase of. the
proposed site for the new power-house at
Geary and Baker streets, the deeds ; to
which were to have been delivered yes
terday. In consequence the deeds were
not delivered. Clerk Fay of the Board of
Supervisors and Auditor Baehr f earing r to.
order the Treasurer to pay the demand of
the owner, notwithstanding tha fact that'
Superior Judge Sloss refused to issue a
temporary restraining order prohibiting'
them from so doing, though such an order
was earnestly prayed for by. counsel rep
resenting the plaintiff. Judge Sloss stated
that h9 would not stay the hands of the
officials in so important a proceeding, un
less proper showing in support of the
petition were made, and he set the case
for hearing on the 12th tilt, at 10 o'clock,
at which time he will determine whether
or not an injunction should issue to re
main in force pending the linal adjudica
tion of the case at bar.
The main contention against the legality
of the proceedings is that while a fair
estimate of the cost of the whole of the
Geary-street road and necessary accesso
ries is $1,000,000 the Board of Supervisors
has provided for the expenditure in the
budget under consideration of but $350,000
for the purpose.
PI.AIXTIFF'S CONTENTION.
"By the expenditure of $360,000," says the
plaintiff, "not more than one-third of the
road can possibly be acquired, which said
one-third will be valueless in itself." Con
tinuing plaintiff says:
Neither the Board of \u25a0 Supervisors nor .the
city and county of San ~ Francisco Intends to
nor will let contracts for nor will attempt
in any manner to acquire the publio utility in
question or any portion " thereof ' in excess of
the sum of $350,000 In value, being about one
third of the fubllc utility.
'At no time herein mentioned have there
beer, nor are there now any funds or -money
of the city and county whatsoever which could
or can be lawfully appropriated In whole or
In part for the acquisition of the public
utility In question. No attempt of any char
acter has been made by the defendants to ob
tain, acquire or render available any sum
of money tor the purpose of applying the same
to the acquisition or the construction or com
pletion of the public utility named, < save and
except ' the said alleged budget appropriation
of $350,000.
In conclusion the plaintiff asserts
that unless restrained the Board of Su
pervisors and the Auditor will illegally
order the expenditure of the $350,000
budget appropriation for the futile pur
chase of but one-third of the road and
that unless they are perpetually re
strained from so doing. the plaintiff and
all other taxpayers of the city and
county will be unjustly and illegally
burdened and will suffer to see 1 the de
parture from the municipal treasury
of $350,000, for which there will be no
adequate return.
ASKS FOR OPINION.

the summons in the suit filed by Strass

BURNS A FOE
OF DRUNKARDS
Labor Member of the British
Cabinet Outlines Ideals in
Speech to Constituents
NO LIKING FOE LOAPEES
Talking on National Issues
"Honest John" Denounces
Imported Coolie Labor
LONDON, Dec. 27. â John Burns, pres
ident of tho local Government Board,
made his first public address since his
entry Into the Cabinet, when he opened
the election campaign at Battersea to
night. In a characteristically cour
ageous speech be said his accession to
office .was the elevation of hl3 con
stituents to power â tho honor was
theirs, but the work was for him. He
declared that he would pander to no
section of the population, but would do
his duty for the benefit of the whole
community.
Burns said he has" such strong sym
pathy with all the Interests of the
working: olassea, that he had no sym
pathy to spare for the loafer, "cadger"
or drunkard. His Ideals were fewer
workhouses, smaller charities, larger
wages, more pleasure and less drink.
In the smaller cities and In the larger
villages he -was already appointing
committees to enable the ratepayers to
have their accounts prepared In such
a way that he who ran might read.
He vigorously attacked what he
called "Orientalized Imperialism," of
which Somallland was the fruit and
South Africa the "rotten ripe product."
He denounced Chinese labor as being
especially dangerous, because It would
lead to absolute chattel slavery.

Condition of UtislneÃS.
A leading New Ycrk banker t<ays:
* "As the year draws to a close It is easy to
Snd abundant material for Eelf-congTatulation.
The country has oxperienced a year of un
parsJleled business activity, all records being
paeeed beta as to volume and profit. Natural,
ly. such en rra has begotten many unfortunate
excesses. Business methods have become les^a
rigid; overeor.fidenee has talten the place of
ordinarj- caution, and continued abuses may
eooner or later threaten me country with a
e?ib&ck leading an era of depression. At the
fcame time, however, there Is no occasion what
ever for taking a discouraging view of the
futpr*. On the contrary, there is every rea
son for hopefulness In the business world. Our
farmers, -who are stlil the backbone of the coun.
try, aro enjcylng extraordinary prosperity in
Â£oth the South and the West. For some Urns
to* come they are likely to be large consumers
of Â«.ll the necessities and many of the luxuries
of # Jlfe. Our industrial classes are also well
employed and at high rates of wages. They,
too. aa a c.a*s are enjoying more of the neces
sities and luxuries of life than usual. Our
ciincral industries are going through a wonder
lul stage of development and earning large
dividends. Tte only thing In Eight to hinder
â¢> continuance of our industrial activity is our
financial excesses, an! It would be far better
to recognize this fact at ence and put on the
brakes than to allow Indiscretions and abuses
to progress until & serious collapse ie Invited."
â â â â â
A Cnutionary Xote.
Henry Oewe, the New York banker and
â¢Trail-street operator, s&yb :
"It Is suite time that cautionary signals
were asaln In evidence. Recent bank difficul
ties In Chicago are an Intimation of what
might be repeated elsewhere. Serious trouble
was only prevented in that Instance by heroic
action, the necessity for which showed the
seriousness of the case. The recently suspend
ed Chicago Institutions I fear are not the
only ones which have b^en lending more free
ly to the large capitalists who dominate them
than ordinary business prudence would permit,
and unless something occurs to check this sort
of . extension of credits more"" trouble Is likely
to follow.
I . 'â¢Another 6ource of doubt Is the extremer
high prices to which many securities are being
pushed. Bold speculators with unlimited capi
tal behind them have been successful in forc
ing their favorites to unreasonably high levels.
By means of adroit manipulation they have
induced the public to enter the market more
freely than for many weeks past, and by al
lowing the earlier public buyers to make some
prpfit they have naturally been able to en
courage and widen the new buying interest.
There has no doubt, however, been much real
izing under cover, and somÂ« of the rich and
heavy holders of securities have been freely
unloading during the past week, or two. Etocks
*hich are selling at unduly high prices are too
well known to require mention, but at their
present altitude they are a menace to the
market and should be carefully avoided by
cither speculators or investors. Another ele
ment of risk In the market is the sensational
activity tn copper stocks. Here, too, the pro
cess of unloading ui>on the public is actively
at work and all sort of questionable properties
are sciiing at unreasonable pnoes. In face of
this reckless speculative activity Is the unsat
isfactory condition of the money market. Funds
are still too scarce for speculative purposes,
ar.d we are in Imminent danger of sharp
f=Tueefces in rates t)gf ore -the close -of the year.
'Money is already freely seeking other chan
\u25a0nehTof Investment, going into real estate or
other more r*ro2tab!e directions."

" \u2666 *NETfV YORK. Dec. 27. â It proved impossible
entirely to Ignore the money stringency in th,?
action of the speculation to-day, but, consid
ering the violence of the activity In the money
. market and the high rates paid there for ac
. ccmmodatlon, it must be conceded that thi* i
speculative position was maintained with re
markable equanimity. No such rates have
been paid for money on call as those exacted
to-day at thm Stock Exchange since the panic
â¢ period of the epring of ISHiI and th* prevailing
â¢rates from 30 to 93. per cent wen ruch as
have proved an Index of panic condltiuns in the
etock market In times past. Yet the pressure
upon stocks proved so liglit that it might bÂ«
â¢ said to represent little more than a cessation
". of -the recent determined buying movement and
â¢ a* moderate retirement on the part of traders
â¢ from position* on the long Â«Ide. The recent
'obeUnate determination to ignore absolutely
the stringency of the money market showed
femt signs of vitality this morning, &t wus
â¢ manifested In the determined bid ling up cf a
â¢ handful of etocks in spite of the admonishing
effect of the money rate on the reneral 'Ist.
American Smelting, for instance, was ruKhfd
up to a new record prie*. and thsre were vig
â¢ Â»rouÂ» advances in a few of the minor special
ties. The name" spirit was manifest In the
â¢ market during the day when there was any
eign of relaxation in the excessive stringency
In the money market. â etocks being taken In
hand and bid up here and there with the ap
parent determination to restore th* impairment
â¢ in prices. Hut these efforts lacked success,
anfl -the market was Inclined to fall Into ex
\u25a0. treme dullness at the Intervals wh*n selling
â¢ pressure \u25a0 was relaxed. The \u25a0 determined op
timism cf the speculative opinion was shown
â¢ by the character of some of the arguments
fceard. The very stringency of the money
market. said these reasoners. was evidence ctf
â¢ thÂ» eagerness of very wealthy capitalists to
withhold funds from the money market for use
k.Jn the purchase of stocks. The presence in
'Wall street of the Secretary pf the Treasury
also came In for the usual cheerful interpreta
tion on the part of the confidential operators
for the ad\-anee. although euch intimations of
. the Secretary's purpose toward the money mar
ket as were allowed to -become puWic offered
no encouragement for hopes of relief for any
.* rurcly tpeculatlve distress. Reports of the
progress of settlement of the bankrupt Chicago
bar.ks were les* satisfactory, and the continued
discount on New York exchange at Chicago
fhowed the maintenance of the pressure there
lor funds on New York. Feme of the other in
terior centers as, well reported a discount on
â¢V â¬W York exchacge. The amount taken from
the banks by the Subtreamiry since the last
hank statement Â«m expanded to $2.353,00f>
The eeverltv of the money stringency had
.. more effect "in driving down thÂ» rates for for
elien exchange,* but discount rates hardened In
London and a further decline in sterling ex
char.jre at Pari* marked the continued money
cr/Â»KÂ»i:rÂ« at that center. The trust company
Â«,.a r,ar.k troubles at Memphis were re?ard*d
fts of mlr.or importance and due to pj>ecial
oauFea. The market broke badly during the
laFt hour with the wilder flights in the money
rate and th* closing was weak and very active.
Bonds were easy. Total sales, par value,
C3.0fi0.000.
TTnitcd States bonds were all unchanged on

BOSTON, Dec. 27.â Money at 60 per cent In
New York was the cause of ' the weakness in
coppers at the close.. The buying this morning

and reflected the feeling of the> public toward
coppers. In the afternoon, however, the high
rates for money prevented any further buying
end stocks sold off freely. Atlantic \u25a0Was well
bought and showed a sharp advance. North

CHICAGO BOARD OF TRADE.
Future Grain and Provisions.
CHICAGO, Dec. 27. â The wheat market was
weak at all times during me day. ' A decrease
of 711,000 bushels in the world's visible supply
was the only encouraging feature of the day's
news for the bulls. At the opening the market
was depressed , by the heavy movement of the
new crop in the Northwest, arrivals at Minne
apolis to-day being : reported . at 695 - cars.
Stocks of wheat at that point showed .an â¢ In
crease of 1,100,000 bushels and this weakened
values here. I Then came , reports of a weak
market in Liverpool,- caused by reports that
the movement of wheat rrom Argentina will
commence January 15,- wnlch Is two -weeks
earlier than last year. Primary receipts in
this country were to-day almost double those
of last year, being 1,005,000 bushels, against
637.C00 bushels for the corresponding day one
year ago. j Despite the heavy preponderance of
bear news, bull . leaders supported the market :
throughout the session by liberal purchases of
May. For this option the lowest point of thfe
day was reached at 86%@86%c. The close was
easy and %@%c lower at 87%@67%c.Â«
Despite liberal local receipts the corn market |
was firm throughout. Trading was not heavy.
May closed %c up at 44% c.
The oats - pit was deserted f nearly all \u25a0 the
time. May closed at %c lower at 31%@32c,
Provisions were weaker because of an easier
market â¢ for live hogs. The feature - of the
i trading was sales of lard and ribs by packers.
At the close May pork was off 10@12%c, ' lard
was down 7%c and ribs were 2%@5c lower. ,

books, was urged as a . beneficial study
for the child in school.
This committee declared that the boy
and - girl of our. public schools to-day
spend too much time in the study of
American history and the technical points
connected with it. It recommended tha/
the courses in American history.be short
ened,.so that more time could be, devoted
to general history of a biographical na
ture.
The following recommendations to the
University of California were offered:
That the University ol California announce
publicly its actual practice, with reference to
giving credit for manual training.
That the admission requirement* for en
trance to the college of. mechanics, mining,
civil engineering and . chemistry .be changed
so that either Latin or Greek may be offered
In place of a modern language, -
That biology be added to the. list of elective
subjects required for admissions .. ' . ,
That some other science be accepted as a j
substitute for phyilcs. . .
Thai the university should offer, the whole
of Latin subject seven of the- preparatory sub- I
Jects (1. c., Cicero -and Virgil) ..as a college!
course. \u25a0
That' entrance to the- college of commerce j
be made possible without \u25a0 the requirement of
Latin.
That the reading In translation of the
â¢"Iliad." the "Odyssey" and' the "Aeneld" be
substituted for the "Classic Mxths" In the I
English requirements. . â¢. j
The report of the committee was j
adopted by the general session.' It will i
be referred to the session of the High
School Teachers' Association to-day for
adoption there. The committee is made
up of Professor Irving Strlngham, Pro
fessor A." F. Lange, Dr. ,A.'.-W.'. Scott,
Fred H. Clark, Herbert Lee, A. E. Kel
logg. G. S. Wells, C. L. Biedenbach and
Dr. E. C. Moore. . .'....
SCORKS SCHOOL. POLITICS.
. President Wheeler's paper was the
striking one of the day. He's struck
sharply at the presence of, politics in
school affairs and declared that this
feature must' be eliminated. He-criti
cized the recent -tendency of the high
schools toward specialization, in imita
tion of the university/and declared that
this specialization .was- a detriment to
the progress of such. "schools and to. the
welfare of the pupils. He -praised Ah
high terms the zeal for public schools
exhibited 'by!- the people of California.
He spoke in part as follows:
Politics and schoor affairs are both' forms of
public activity, but \u25a0 they cannot bÂ» mixed .in
eny proportion whatsoever .without noxious ami
ft-tid product. "Politics Is good In Its place,
but it hae no' place, in or. near , the school*.
It will take' the children's, bread and give: It
unto dogs. It 'ought to be .'possible for'ra -pro
gressive State like .California to devise ia"f way
by which superintendents "and "other- school
officials * can -be spared. \ht necessity :of sick-;
Ing their places or continuance, therein by means
or the po"tf cal canvass, convention and cabal. .
If there were no other reason weighing against j
the present -\u25a0 method than the . uncertainty, cf
tenure connected with the" fluctuating chance'
of the political party upon whose -ticket -{ho
candidate i% named, that would.be enough, to
condemn it. . .... . ' â¢ -
We cannot expect to command the service
of professionally equipped 'men > for .our: super- '
lctendents unless opportunity, .for a' , consistent,
professional caner is offerad; ' In 'other .words,
we cannot expect -to get as much as Ye de
ftrve from the salaries" rv.e 'pay. If the re
vision of .the. fundamental â¢ law .''presents 'â¢ too ;
cumbrous an obstacle,, why = . cannot the party,
organization be Induced- to ! .leave, tbe â¢nomina
tion cf a common candidate- to a committee of.
leading disinterested citizens -selected - either'
by the party organizations or by a school con
: ventloa of citizens assembled without , regard'
Ito party? This would not" be*, a .new expe'rl-
cirnt. It has been tried *nd . will 'work. . . '

TALKS OX ". SANITATION.
| Governor Pardee. spoke strongly "on
â¢ th*> subject of school sanitation. - He
urged the teachers to- watch'the little
things that concern the health: of,. tlie
children. "In telling of one ."school- he
said: - ' . -\u25a0 \u25a0-\u25a0 ;:.â¢.,'
, The last time I visited a.J school house IV found !
the. children" * hats and wraps hung. in "aTirki
and unventilated hallway, and the " smell f ol'
th* Wâ¬t \u25a0 garments, seething: in the ..wa rm air,!
was not Inviting.. I asked the principal"" if :
every child had its own particular hook upon j
which to hang Its outer , garments, and -was!
told that such waÂ» not the case. , My "Inquiry ,i
aa to why thÂ« hallway was not ventilated, or!
a ventllatable> room given up to.use as a h&t'
aad cloakroom," was . met by tbÂ« assertion ' that
the Board of Education. , although repeatedly
asked to Co so, had : not rranted the request.
Every time I think of ' those ; bats and coals
promiscuously hung In that damp, warm/dark"
unventilated hallway,. I wonder . how many of
those children have died from, diphtheria, scar
let fever, mÂ«asleÂ« and the J ike. to sajr nothing
of those who* have , tuffered from- lit
tle things . that. " while',, annoying," are" not'
necessarily fatal, like the slow-era wllng things

Forest/ Song,',V : whlch^shef; rendered in
the most "pleasing \u25a0" manner! "William
Hi Langdon introduced the speakers."
J. 11. Ackerman, Superintendent of
Public Instruction of Oregon, was the
first' speaker introduced. His subject,
"The Teacher Who. Succeeds." was' a
topic which seemed to appeal to his
hearers. Frequently during the course
of his talk he appealed for their rjghts
and was liberal in suggestions as to
how their conditions could be bet
tered. " ' ' ' *,
He opened his topics , by reciting
nine qualifications a 'teacher . should
possess.' 'The speaker .was full of wit
and the "audience had the pleasure of
enjoying some hearty laughs. The
first qualification "he mentioned, '-, and
which 'he -dwelt 'upon to "some extent,
was" the necessity of an instructor en
joying perfect health. He said he did
not believe -in giving teachers too
much ; writing," as it .deprived them of
their time for -recreation. This re
mark was. unanimously applauded.
The "necessity of sleep was :, essential
to get the best"] results from a teacher.
He â¢believed a teacher; should be hu-.
morous and* able to enjoy a good story
as welLas .tell one.
V Congeniality between teacher and
class had* a 'tendency to encourage
students to do th.eir best. Soothing
voice, ideal inspirations and self-con
fidence were mentioned by Mr. Acker
man as essential qualifications for a
successful teacher.
'. ".'The Reform of Language, Instruc
tion in the Grades" was the topic of
Henry Suz'zallo. instructor in educa
tion at Stanford.- He talked at length
I on the system of teaching in the vari
ous .grades and how knowledge was
'imparted /to the youth who had Just
entered school. -He thought the sys
tem "of leaching- a child in the* early
grades was wrong and ; believed that
"more' thne should be given to silent
.'reading. \u25a0 Â«.

If the clever secret service agents of
L'ncle Sam and the ambitious police of
San: Francisco and Oakland really want
io nrreet Louis W. Baker, -who induced
one weak woman to steal Government
funds that he might spend them on
another^ they should search every room
of a flrst-clasM apartment-house In the
vicinity of Polk and Jackson streets,
San Frnnclsco. \u25a0 ;
-'As the notorious murderer. Andre wÂ»,
lived with and killed a frail woman' ln
the heart of San Francisco, so Baker
has lived for some days with Mrs. Min
nie Nelson of Alamcda In this same
apnrtment-honse. '"\u25a0
From the moment of the news of the
defalcation of Mlhj. llonrn nnil the dis
appearance of : Baker It has been sus
pected br thoite on "the Inside" that
Baker Tins not far away, and that If
found he would be within hailing dis
tance of Mrs. .Veliton. '
Last night an attempt was made to in
terview Baker at the apartment-house
where he dwells, but, though the land
lady admitted he had been there a day:
or two- ago, she ; denied' that any one was
then In the apartments rented by him.
While ; the denial was yet fresh on the
lady's lips, ; a call for ice water was rung
In from the fugitive's apartments.
When the reporter was ushered. to the
doorway of Baker's ; rooms an attractive
and somewhat excited young woman ap
peared and was 'apparently - embarrassed
by questions concerning the much-wanted
Baker. \u25a0' "A" nioment later a white-haired;
and bewhiskered old man, nimble as a
cricket, .poked his patriarchal visage
from an adjoining ; cove .and -announced
that he". was Baker. The .' young lady
closed the door, the senior was told that
he was not the Apollo .wanted and there
was relief on the lioor when the reporter,
went : ' downstairs. At't the landlady's
apartments ' at Hhe â¢ foot |of the stairway,
the real Louis W. Baker was describedâ
a. young man of good physique and pleas
ant manners. At the house he was
known as J. \u25a0 W. Baker and addressed as
"Jack" ;by his companion.
For more than a year Baker has been

panted Baker when he left San Francisco
last Saturday for a supposed destination
near Petaluma. In discussing the gay
printer with . her friends from time to
time Mrs. Nelson has said he was "good "
to her, but she always said he made the
money he spent out of his printing busi
ness, which he represented to her as very
prosperous.
Miss H. Lulu Bowen, who stole Govern
ment funds for Baker to squander In for
bidden paths, lies a nervous wreck at her
home. 612 Merrimac street. Oakland.
A dispatch from Oakland at an early
hour this moraine says that Baker ap
peared late last night at the residence
of a printer named Frank Corey and
asked for lodgings for. a few days. Corey
told htm there was not room and soon
thereafter Corey notified the police of
Oakland. Within an hour the police of
Oakland and Alameda, as .well as tb.e
Sheriff of the county, were on the fugi

ANNUAL FEAST
OF CALIFORNIA
CLUBWOMEN
LAURA BRIDE POWERS
1 The annual breakfast of the California
Clubâ the usual feast in honor of the
silver-haired foundersâ was celebrated
yesterday in the auditorium of the club's
new home on Clay street, when 200 guests
foregathered to do them honor.
â¢ Stunning gowns there were in plenty
and loads of pretty fursâ evidences of an
o'er generous Saint Nick, who seams to
have left more beautiful furs In town
than ever before.
Gathered together at three long tables,
strewn with hollyberry and agleam with
ruby lights, the great hall was gay and
the air a . pretty babel. '
Through the buzz three musicians, led
: by the charming Mr. Jaulus. contrived to
send forth a few melodies that wrought
respect for their art and repose to tongues
âthat is to . some tongues, for it takes
more than- a- Jaulus symphony to sllenca
some tongues that you and. l do know.
The luncheon was admirably manipu
lated by Mrs James C. Crawford, assisted
by Mm*e. Emilia Tojetti. Mrs. J. B. Mitch
ell. Mrs. Charles A. Warren and Mrs.
Charles Fonda. v
Mrs. Lovell White served with distinc
tion as toastmistress, presenting the fol
lowing speechmakersâ which were, by the
way, about six too many:
Greeting Mrs. Aylett R. Cotton: 'To the
Fonnaew." Mrs. E. U Baldwin: "From the
Founder*," Mrs. Hay ward: "Sens tive Souls.'
Mr* . JanW. Orr; \u25a0â¢tÂ°â¢Hy i or â¢â¢ T *"* i *
l'eople and Teacups." Mrs. Louis H. Long;
-Two View Polnt*-Wh!ch Is Yours?" Mrm. W.
A Maddern- "Our Illusions. Mrs. Aaron
SchloS T "Club Reporte." Mr, Emll Pohll:
"ThÂ». Press " Mrs. Laura Bride Powers; "First
Lo?e or Last." Ml-s Bird WUaon: "Charge of
the FlyÂ« Hundred." JennÂ» Morrow Long; "To
the President," Mrs. John Russ; bon mots, Dr.
Amy Bowen. Miss Susanna Patch.
' Mrs. George Bates was billed to hare
told about "Man's Failure as. a Poem."
but' Illness prevented a demonstration of
this disheartening revelation, and the
guests went .home . happy, still believing
that. man is a poem â sometimes. ..
Taken all In . all, the toasts were . pithy
and sharp, with a lot of wit and wisdom
sprinkled through 'them, but fully half
couldfhave been dispensed with and thÂ©
guests get- their moneys worth. \u25a0
: But , women's feasts are not the only
feasts wherat â¢ too much one-tongue talk
is loosed. It's \a fault of nine-tenths 'of
the semi-public luncheons and dinners,
and is. of course, due to a desire to <io
honor to the' bidden folk. And It's a truly
funny, thing that we who rail most
against long programmes .are never
caughti refusing to lengthen them.
\u0084 A Christmas gift to the" club of a picture
was made by Mrs.' Hobe, Mrs. Sara
Reimerâ who is-nÂ«ver found bankrupt in
a matter of wordsâ accepting It upon the
club's -behalf. . ,
Jenrie Morrow Long's "Charge of the
Five ' Hundred" was * one : of the cleverest
caprices . of the ; afternoon. \ It : was a par
ody upon Uhe advance upon"* Congress of
800 clubwomen* pleading in behalf of the
Big Trees." who J were met by Speaker
Cannon and abruptly told to run away

t The "poem"â for which ; apologies . were
abundantly offered to the shades of Ten
nysonâwas "\u25a0_ a clever construction from
the muse of. MTs-Lovell. White. ;',
