Mlille Sherlock Holmes exercised his

THE Room of Gold In the British
Museum is probably well enough
known to the inquiring alien and
the traveled American. *A true
Londoner, however. I myself had
never heard of It until Raffles casually
proposed a raid.
"The older I grow. Bunny, the less 1
think of your so-called precious etones.
When did they ever bring in half their
market value in Â£. s. d.? There was the
first little crib we ever cracked together
you with your Innocent eyes shut. A
thousand pounds that stuff was 'worth,
but how many hundreds did it actually
letch? The ' Ardagh emeralds weren't
much better, old Lady Melrose's necklace
was far worse, but that little lot the
other night has about finished me. A
cool hundred for goods priced well over
four, and Â£S5 to come off for bait, since
\u25a0ne only got a tenner for tbej ring I
bought and paid for like an ass. I'll be
shot if I ever touch a diamond again!
Not if it was the Kohlnoor; those few
â¢whacking Etones are too well known, and
to cut them up is to decrease their value
by arithmetical retrogression. Besides,
that brings you up against the Fence once
more, and I'm done with the beggars for
good and all. You talk about your edi
tors and publishers, your literary swine!
Barabbas was neither a robber nor a
publisher, but a six-barred, barbed-wire,
epike-topped Fence. What we really
\u25a0want is an Incorporated Society of
Thieves, with come public-spirited old
forger to run it for us on business lines."
Raffles uttered these blasphemies under
his breath, not," I am afraid, out of any
respect for my one redeeming profession,
but because we were taking a midnight
airing on the roof after a whole day of
June in the little flat below. The stars
thone overhead, the lights of London
underneath, and between the ' lips of
ltaffles a cigarette of tae old and only
brand. I had sent in secret for a box of
the best. The boon had arrived that
night, and the foregoing speech was the
rirst result. I could afford to ignore the
insolent iSides, however, where the ap
parent contention was so manifestly un
sound.
"And how are you going to get rid o*
your gold?" said I pertinently.
"Nothing easier, my dear rabbit."
"Is your Room of Gold a roomful of
sovereigns?"
Raffles laughed softly at my scorn.
"No. Bunny, it's principally in the shape
of archaic ornaments, whose value, I ad
mit, is largely extrinsic But gold is gold,
from Phoenicia to Klondike, and if we
cleared the room we should eventually
"I should melt It down Into a nugget
and bring it home from the U. S. A. to
morrow."
"And then?"
"Make them pay tip In hard cash
across the counter of the Bank of Eng
land. And you can make them." .
That I knew, and so said nothing for
a time, remaining a hostile though a
silent critic while we paced the cool
black leads with our bare feet softly
as cats.
"And how do you. propose to get
enough away," at length I asked, "to
make It worth while?"
"Ah, there you have It," said Raffles.
"I only propose to reconnolter the
ground to see what we can see. We
might find some hiding place for a
night; that, I am afraid, would be our
only chance."
."Have you ever been there before?
"Not eince they got the one good.
portable piece which I believe that
they exhibit now. It's a long' time
since I read of Itâ l can't remember
where â but I know they have got a
gold cup of sorts worth several tbou
ear.Cs. A number of the Immorally rich
clubbed together end presented it to
the nation, and two of the richly im
moral intend to snaffle It for them
selves. At any rate we might go and
have a look at it, Bunny, don't you
- think?"
Think! I seized his arm.
"When? When? When?" I- asked
like a Quick-firing gun.
"The sooner the better, while old
Theobald's away on his honeymoon."
Our medico had married the week be
fore, nor was any fellow practitioner
taking his work â at least not that
considerable branch of it which con-
Fisted of Raffles â during his brief ab
sence from town. There were reasons,
delightfully obvious to us. why such a
plan would have been highly unwise
in Dr. Theobald. I, however, was send
ing his daily screeds and both matuti
nal and nocturnal telegrams the com
position of which afforded Raffles "not a
little enjoyment.
"Well, then, when â when?" I began
to repeat.
'To-morrow If you like."
"Only to look?"
The limitation was my one regret.
"We must do so. Bunny, before we
leap."
"Very well." I sighed. "But to-mor
row it is!" ,-- ... - > .
And the to-morrow it really was.
I taw the porter that night and, I still
think, .bought his absolute allegiance for
the second coin of me realm. My story,
however, invented by Raffles, was suffi
ciently epecious in itself. That sick gen
tleman, Mr. Maturin (as I had to remem
ber to call him), was realjy or apparently
sickening for fresh air. Dr. Theobald
would allow him none; he was pestering
me for just one day in the country while
the glorious weather lasted. I was my
self convinced that no possible harm
could come of the experiment. Would
the porter help.me in so innocent and
meritorious an Intrigue? The man hesi
tated. I produced my .half sovereign.
The man was lost. And at .half-past 8
next roorn'.njr, before the heat of the day.
Ruffles and I drove to Kew Gardens In a
hired landau which was tr. call for us at
midday end wait until we/ came. The
porter had assisted me to carry my in-
valid downstairs, in a carrying-chair
hired (like the landau) from Harrow's
Stores for the occasion.
It was a little after nine when we
crawled together Into the gardens: by
half-past ray invalid had, had enough,
and out he tottered on ray arm: a cab. a
message to our coachman, a timely train
to Baker street, /another cab, and we
were at the British Museumâ brisk jj pe
destrians nowâ not. very many , minutes
after, the opening hour of ten a. m. â¢ ' ,
It was one of those glowing days which
will not be^ forgotten by many who were
in town at'that time. The Diamond: Ju
bilee was upon us, the Queen's weather
had already : cct in. "-â¢ Raffles, indeed, de-*
c-lared It was as hot'as Italy and Austra
lia put. together;. and certainly . the short
cummer nights gave: the , channels - of
wood and asphalt and the continents of
brick and mortar but little time to cool.
At the British, Museum .'the. pigeons were
crooning among ;tne^ shadows of "the
grimy colonnade, and the : stalwart ' jani-"
tors looked less stalwart than 7 usual, " as
though their > medals too heavy for
them. I recognized , some habitual.read
ers going to meir labors .underneath the
dome; of mere visitors we 'seemed "among

"That's the room," 6aid Raffles, who
had bought: the two-penny guide, as we
studied it; openly on the nearest bench;
"number <3, upstairs and sharp I round to
the right. Come on. Bunny .",'.'; :. .
A:id he led the way in. silence, but with
a long metnodlcal stride which I could
not understand until. we came to 'the cor
ridor leading to the Room of â¢ o v.Â», when
he turned to me for a; moment.

"Well, I shall write to the Times all

sary risks run with the nation's property.
You said there was an attendant Just
outside, but he sounds to me as though
he were at the other end of the corridor.
I shall write to-day!"
For an instant we all three listened,
and Raffles was Tight. Then I saw two
things in one glance. Raffles had stepped
a few inches backward and stood poised
upon the ball of each foot, his arms half
raised, a light in his eyes. And another
kind of light was breaking over the crass
features of our friend the constable.
"Then shall I tell you what I'll do?"
he cried, with . a sudden clutch at the
whistle chain on his chest. The whistle
flew out. .but it never reached his lips.
There were a couple of sharp smacks
like double barrels discharged :- all \u25a0 but
simultaneously,' and the man reeled
against ma so that I could './not help
catching him as he fell.
;r "Well. done, Bunn! I've knocked him
outâ l've knocked him out! Run you to
the;Â«Joor and see If the attendants have
heard anything, and take them on if they.
have.'.'
Mechanically I did as I was told. There
was no time for thought, still less. for re
monstrance or reproach, though my sur
prise must have been even more complete
than that of the constable beiore Raines
knocked \ the sense out of him. Even In
my utter,.; bewilderment, ' however, the
instinctive caution of the real criminal
did not desert me.' I ran to the door, b\u
I \u2666 sauntered through it to plant myself
before a Pompeiian fresco in the corridor,
and there were the two attendants still
gossiping outside the. further door; nor
did they hear the dull crash which I
heard even as I watched them out of the
corner of each eye.
If was hot weather, as I have said, but
the perspiration on ray body seemed al
ready to have turned Into a skin of Ice.
Then . l ' caiisht the faint reflection of my
own face.; in the caslnjy of the fresco, and
it frightened' me into some semblance of
myself ;as Raffles Joined me with bis
hands, in hi3 /pockets. But my - fear t and
indignation J were ? redoubled 'at the sigh;
of him, when , a ; single glance convinced
me ' that hl3 pockets ' were , as '- empty as
his and his lrcad outrage the . most
wanton and reckless 'of his whole career.
Â» "Ah," vverty t Interesting, -.very] interesting,

"At the to? [6t* the stairs."
"Thank you. â¢ Then we'll work round

There was this much managrsrasat
The rest was our colossal lack. A
hansom was being' paid off at thÂ« foot
of the steps outside, and in we jumped.
Raffles shouting "Charing Cross!" for
all Woomsbury to hear.
We had turned into Bloomsfcjiry
street without exchanging? a syllable
\u25a0when he's truck the trapdoor with his
fist.
"Where the devil are you driving
us?" .
"Charing Cross, sir."
:"I said King's Cross. Bound you
spin and drive like blazes or we miss .
our train! There's one ' to" York at
10:35," added Raffles as the trapdoor w
slammed; "we'll book there. Bunny, and
then we'll slope through the subway to
the Metropolitan, and so to ground via
Baker street and Earl's Court,"
And actually in half an hour he wu
seated once more in .the hired carry
ing chair, while the porter and I stajp
gcred upstairs with my decrepit
charge, for whose shattered strength,
oven one hour In Kew Gardens had
proved too much! Then, and not until
then, when we had got rid of the por
ter and were alone at last did I tell
Baffles in the most nervous English at
my comand, frankly and exactly what
I thought of him and of his latest deed.
Once started, moreover. I spoke as I
have seldom spoken to living man. and
Raffles, of all men. stood my abuse
without a murmur, or rather he sat It
out, too astonished even to take off alt
hat. though I thought his eyebrows
wÂ«rald have lifted it from his head. v
"But it always was your Infernal
way." I was savagely concluding. "You
make one plan and you tell mo an
other"
"Not to-day. Bunny. I swear!"
"You mean to tell me you really did
start with the bare Idea of finding â¢>
place to hide in for a night?"
"Of course I did." B â¢; ;Y*V>
"It was to be the mere reconnoitar
you pretended?"
"There was no pretense about.
Bunny." i v.'.^
"Then why on earth go and do what
you did?"
"The reason would be obvious to any
one but you." said RafCes. still with no
unkindly scorn. "It was the temptation
of a minuteâ the . final Impulse of the
fraction of a second, when Roberto saw
that I was tempted, and let me tee that
he saw it. It's not a thing I care to do.
and I shan't ba happy till the papers tell
me thÂ© poor devil is alive. But a knock
out shot was the only chance for us
then."
"Why? You don't get run in for being
tempted, nor yet for 1 showing that you
are!"
"But I should have deserved running in
if I hadn't yielded to such a temptation
as that. Eunny. It was a chance In. a
hundred thousand! We might go there
every day of *our lives and never again be
the only outsiders to the room, with the
billiard-marking Johnnie practically out
of earshot at one and the same time. It
was a gift from the gods; not to have
taken it would have been flying in the
face of providence." -
"But you didn't.jtake it," said L "You
went and left it behind, .. \u0084 . \ ,
I wish I had a kodak for the little*
smile with which Raffles shook his head,
for It was one that he kept for those
great moments of which, our vocation Is
not devoid. All this time he had been
wearing his hat tilted a little over eye
brows no longer raised. And now at last
I knew where the . gold cup was.
It stood for days upon his chimney
piece, this costly trophy whose ancient
history and final fate filled newspaper
columns even in these days of Jubilee
and for which the flower of Scotland
a
Yard was said to be waklsjc h!g2l ud
low. Our constable, we l*amÂ«d, fe&4
been stunned only, and from the moment
that I brought him an craning paper
with the â¢ news Raffles* tpirlta rosÂ« to â¢
height inconsistent with tla eauabla tem
perament,- and as unusual In him as ths
sudden Impulse upon which he had acted
with such effect. The cup itself appealed
to me no more than It had done before.
Exquisite It might be, handsome It was.
but-ao light in the hand that taÂ» mars
gold of it would scarcely have poured
three figures out of the melting pot. Asd
what said Raffles but that he would never
melt it at all!
"Taking it .was an offense against the

THE swift succeeding days brim
med with surprises. The bulletin
board 3 were filled with 'Has been
appointed â viee â resigned." Fin
ally the lightning struck near
home. Mr. Sampson was relieved,
A. L. L. Warner being appointed in
the vacated position. Locally, this
"was an added "straw." Many of the
drifting element pictured with lurid
vividness the unenviable reputation borne
by the prospective official.
"I worked under him," cried an old
rounder, forming one of a party engaged
In rigorous discussion, "on the H. L.
N. when he was yard superintendent
and if a dirtier litpe cuss ever existed
it is below tha Rio Grande. Nothing
with a. drop of white blood in his car
cass could train with him one minute
et midnight In hell. The little brute is
like a coyote, never in the open, always
ekulking on your trail, waiting with
devilish patience the slip of an unwary
moment to nip you." In the wonderful
"wireless" of the rail, the information
in some way leaked through that he
â¢would arrive on No. 1 on a certain day.
When thÂ« train pulled in the platform
was darkened with all the men In town.
From the rear deeper a little slender
figure sprang unnoticed to the platform.
The flagman from the rear step, an odd
grin on his face, pointed out the rapidly
disappearing form. In an instant every
man was "sizing up" the importation.
"Brady," said John, "what do you think
of him?"
"Seems more like a coCa water clerk
than a man capable of handling this di
vision."
"A hornet is not a very large affair."
laughed John.
The remark was overheard and from
that day on the sobriquet "Hornet" was
the superintendent's accepted designa
tion. Like all terse nicknames of the
rail, it was very appropriate. From the
first the men were made aware of the ex
istence of a new elementâ one of exasper
ating espionage and swift, merciless
judgment in which long and loyal service
was the least considered factor. After
the removal of a number of the oldest
and best men in the service UDon charges
of the most trivial nature, it dawned
upon the most conservative that the
management was pursuing a deliberate
policy â one that had for its object the
discharge of all of the "Blank men." As
this discovery ran through cab, caboose,
or switch shanty, its realization was
quickly followed by a perceptible demor
alization of the men.
The unreasoning brutality of discipline
soon had its logical effect. First-class
men shunned the system as though a yel
low flag waved over its entire length, the
only applicants for the quickly vacated
positions being from the riff-raff of the
service. The Inter-Mountain cabs soon
framed faces known upon dozens of black
lists as being the "mene, tekel, upharsin"
of . the country. Under the trembling
hands and befogged brains of these in
competents the road became a veritable
slaughter-pen. Thousands of Hollars
daily disappeared In crashing "head-end
ers," burned engines and wrecked ma
chinery, until at last the reckless Hooli
gans dared to stay only long enough to
accumulate eufficient funds to get away.
Then it was that the once finest line in
the country made its chief business the
Issuance of time checks or the certificate
of hospital bills. One afternoon, as John
eat alone In the shady corner of the hotel
porch, his eyes fell upon the limping ap
proach of a blackened, generally disrep
utable figure.
"Hello! Brady," he cried. "What's
up?"
"Only the old story," growled the paln
firawn lips as he, with many groans and

was secretly alarmed at the storm he had
evoked.

much dignity. "You must wait until your

At last, however, and at' the height of
his craze, Raffles and reason seemed to
come together again as suddenly as they
bad parted company in the Room of

"Bunny," he cried, flinging his news

much contortion of his face, sank care
fully into a chair. "One of their latest
hog-heads forgot the little trifle of 19' s
being on the time card and undertook to
pass me without a sidetrack, resulting
in the orthodox Inter-Mountain trade
markâtwo engines down the dump, cov
ered three cars deep. I had time to un
load, but stopped rather hard on the cor
ner of a rock-left ankle and back seem
out of line."
"Well, one consolation," answered
John, "the Hornet can find nothing in
it asjainst you."
"Not unless he takes the ground that
I should have known that the 'Hooli
gan* had forgotten about us," returned
Brady, adding as a new pain darted
through the Injured foot, "not that I
would be very much suryrised if- he
tried It.".
Here Mr. Jasper joined them, asking
anxiously. "Did you get it very bad.
Brady? Well you got out lucky.
What the future of this accursed road
Is to be is beyond me. It certainly looks
to me as ii a deliberate effort was
being made to bankrupt it. Now. boys.
Tve been here since the first spike
was driven and have grown gray in
Inter-Mountain service. As the last of
the old officials. It seems my duty to
see if my suspicions can be verified.
I've got enough to last the few years
yet remaining to me, so discharge for
insubordination has no terrors for me.
My idea is this. I'm going to Unitah
and if I get to him I intend to take
the lid off in the president's office. It
very likely will result in an old fool
being kicked out. but I may be af
forded a chance to unload some of my
burden. If I can do anything to help
the existing conditions I care little for
insults or even discharge. This thins
of standing helpless while the few of
my yet remaining boys ride daily to
death or unmerited disgrace is becom
ing unbearable."
"If you will wait until I can travel,
said Brady grimly. "John and I will
accompany you and look after the
'kicking out" part" Mr. Jasper. looked
the great form over, an appreciative
twinkle under the moisture filling the
kindly old eyes.
"I would like to see the pair of you
turned loose in that office, boiled shirts
and fourteen-inch collars would be at
a premium for a day or so. But se
riously â will you both go with me?"
"Yes," answered Brady. "We have
nothing here to worry about. We will
go with you as employes. If the game
is called, we are at the time check
headquarters. The only thing bother
ing me is how can I go to work else
where and ignore the fact of coming,
from the Inter-Mountain. You know, Mr.
Jasper, how you would look it an ap
plicant who would refer you to this
road for reference."
"I'd never give him a chance," re
turned the old man hotly, adding: "But
I can personally fix both of you out.
Inter-Mountain ideas are not enter
tained in every office in. these moun
tains."
A few days later the new chief clerk
in the president's office looked , with
supercilious disgust upon a party of
tnree filling, with broad shoulders, the
little railed off space. A burly red
faced old fellow in loose, grease-stained
clothes, overtopped by two towering
heads. With a muttered "a nice place
for train hands," he leaned -back into
his chair, then with hands clasped be
hind his head contemptuously, "What
do you fellows want in here?"
The contempt ' tinging the insolent
voice was a whip-cord across the faces
of the two younger men. As they start
ed forward Mr. Jasper gave each a re
straining look, answering; calmly, "We
would like to see Mr. Coleman; is he
in?"
"Who are you and what is your busi
ness"
"I am Mr. Jasper, master mechanic
at Red Canyon, and these are two!. of
my engineers. We wish, if he/ Is at
liberty, to see Mr. Coleman." The rough
dared he run off this way .' Noting the
empty shafts, the loosened pony, a young
man came forward.
"Can I be of service?" he asked. "I
speak a little Norsk. What! Your boy
is lost? Oh, pray take mine. It would
be a pity for you to lose your place,"
with a glance at the purpling English
man. And Miss Maxwell, anxious to have
the matter settled before the arrival ]of
her mother and ' sister, after a moment's
consideration, consented. /
"And I am so glad you did." declared
Rita later. ;I would 'Just have hated to
give up our place to that horrid .man
who has been trying' everyday to get it.

But Miss Maxwell did not answer. She
had just discovered the -loss of a tiny

returned Mr. Coleman with a sneer, add

\"No, sir," replied Mr. Jasper , quickly.
"but I think you do. Now let me tell
you something. No railroad, let it 3
monopoly of territory be never so se
cure, can persistently ignore outraged
public opinion. The Infamous work your
subordinate has accomplished at Red
Canyon has turned tae hand of each
citizen against you. Those old men
whose home . ties you have heartlessly
broken, : \u25a0 whose innocent families you
have endeavored to pauperize, carried
each on -his long search for employment
the. sincere sympathy of the entire town.
Men like you never ascribe to the men
in active service upon your engines or
trains the possession of sufficient gray
matter to equip" a $40 per month clerk.
You * know that in those little railroad
towns the engineers and conductors are
men of prominence in social, fraternal
and 'religious . circles by intellectual
equipment ranking with the best, own

in politics In virtue of proven capacity.

instead of looking upon comfortable
homes, environing merry faces and useful

orgies of imported dead beats and bums.

the feelings of hatred entertained toward
the ' corporation" " directly responsible for
the transformation.

. As the speaker paused. Mr. Colemaa
sat staring at him In surprised silence,
then said, in a voice in which he vainly
endeavored to produce his former bully-
Ing tones: "Am I to understand that it
is the Intention ' of the people of this
State to attempt to take from us the
control of our property?"
"By no means," came the deliberate re
ply. "Your property is a thing over which
we have no control, but we do reserve the
right to protect the lives of those com
pelled to reluctantly avail themselves of
your function as a public carrier. We
grant to you a perfect right to play
'freeze-out' with your unfortunate minor
ity stockholders by the deterioration of
machinery and wreckage of rolling stock,
but the pitiful scent of innocent blood
filling the nostrils of the people has at
last aroused their manhood, and it needs
not a prophet to say , that you and your
policy are doomed."
In the silence ensuing the great office
clock swept its pendulum across many
seconds.
Finally, Mr. Coleman said in a voice
of Icy coldness: "Mr. Jasper, your im
mediate superior will accept your resig
nation." then, insultingly, added: "But
how about your, bodyguard?" Brady,
with a burning oath, replied: "If you
open your mouth again I'll fill It full of
flat. Mr. Jasper is yet my immediate su
perior, and to him, the only gentleman
on thi3 cursed pike. I now tender my
resignation."
"Add mine to It," John chimed la
gravely. â¢
Mr.. Coleman .turned to a package of
papers as they passed out. and John
noticed the fat hands were quivering
like aspens.
"A nice pair of hot heads,** laughed
Mr. Jasper as they strolled down the
street. "Never again quit 100 miles

"I see myself walking." returned Mr.

Till: story of Stephen Inness and bis
wtfe is without parallel.
In all historj' there is, I believe,
nothing like itâ and it is beins: lived
here and now, in this, our brilliant,
gay and heedless city of San Francisco,
in ihls year* of our Lord. 1905.
We have, it Is true, the story of Afcelara
and Heioise. and we can v.-h<*n we are
in Paris go to the cemetery of Pere la
Chaise and pee their tomb -where their
dust now mingles in peace, as Heioise so
passionately desired it should. For three
centuries they slept their sleep of death
in the same tomb in the convent of
Paraclet. until the sense of propriety of
a lady-abbess was so disturbed by tbis
e^candalous juxtaposition of the dead that
nothing would appease it but tie separat
*r.g of them by the width of the church.
And we are glad when we stand by their
torabâ eo cadurinc in their Ftory through
e!l tha centuriesâ that in snite of the
scrupulous lady-abbess they are together
again.
We have also the story of Theodosius and
Coastantia that Joseph Addison told with
50 much tenderness in the Spectator No.
164, and that, no doubt, was wept over
in the boudoirs of London town on the
morning ot Friday, September 7, 1711â
of the Theodosius and Constantla who
also lie in one grave because "they were
lovely In their lives, and in their deaths
they -were not divided."
But in tach of these tie man and the
woman were driven apart and into seek
ing consolation in religious labors by un
toward circcmstances. not by voluntary
and deliberate choice.
Here is where the story of Stephen In
ness and his \rife differs from theirsâ
and from all others.
Stephen Inness and his wife have all
. that Abeiard and Heioise. that Theodo
ti-js and Contantia broke their hearts
fnr.
In the hollow of their hands Stephen
Inness and his wife hold all the means
for merely human happiness that so
many less favored men and \u25a0women are
driving and struggling to attain.
And yet Stephen InneES and his wife
have determined to separate â to put
(xway from them their merely human
happiness, to give up that which they
cJreadv possess, to walk in separate
vays.
Like Abeiard and Heioise, like Theo
dosius and Constantia, the one will en
ter the priesthood, the other will en
ur a sisterhood.
Stephen Inness and his wife are pre
paring to go to Italy. They will go
very soon, to Rome, to petition the
Pore to give his sanction to their sep
aration, to the dissolution of their mar
riage bond.
Because that bond has grown Irk
some? 'J.
Because they no longer love each
other?
Because, perhaps, marriage has dis
illusioned them, and they find that they
never loved each other?
Because they are tired of each other?
Because their marriage was a mis
take?
Because their dally life is one of
bickering imd strife?
Because of poverty, or ill-health, or
111 temper, or inharmony, or failure in
their obligations to each other?
Because of some ghastly, grinning
skeleton in the closet that pops out
and stands between them as soon as
they are together with their door shut
upon the world?
No! No! ! No !! ! For none of these
reasons. -V;
No one who knows the earnest man
and lovely woman who have come to
their strange determination can lay his
finger on any one of these common rea
sons and say it is the rock upon which
their happiness was wrecked.
They themselves will tell you â will
maintain â that their happiness is not
wrecked, that they are only going for
ward to a new and brighter happiness.
Stephen Inness and bis wife are both
young.- >:.->\u25a0-'
They have health, wealth and the ca
pacity for the full enjoyment of life.
They are both well-bred, well edu
cated, cultured.
They both have pleasing person

Mr. Xnnes has a clear-cut. Intellectual
face, manly, refined, and sharpened a
little by asceticism, a well-set-up, active
figure, for he was a college athlete and
one of the crack football players In the
University of Pennsylvania,
Mrs. Inness Is comely, gentle, reserved,
domestic, possessing the loveliest of the
feminine attributes, a woman softly, es
sentially womanly. She is a gifted mu
sician, a talented artist.
Mr. Insess is the son of tha P.ev. Robert
F. Inness of Philadelphia, noted In char
itable work and the founder of the Phil
adelphia Home of the Merciful Saviour
for Crippled Children.
Mrs. Inness was Louise Smlthers, the
daughter of a wealthy New York bank
er. F. Â£. Smlthers.
These two young people enjoying every
advantage of birth, education and envi
ronment, sa happily conditioned, met some
cix years ago and, fell in love after the
manner of young people. Five years ago
they were, .married and came here.
Mr. Inness was ordained' an Episcopal
clergyman and came here as rector of the
pretty little church -of St.. Mary the Vir
gin.
In the little white frame rectory on
Union street Just around the corner from
the church the bride and 'groom set up
their household rods, the -bride - trans
forming the modest little bouse ' Into a
charming home, for above all 1 Mrs. Inness
has the gift of the , home-maker.
For three years the force and beauty
and earnestness , of Mr., lnsess' sermons
made tha church of St. Mary the Virgin
a notable church, and the charm' of Mrs..
Jnnftss* personality made the rectory a so
cial center for the parishioners: ;
Then Mr. and Mrs. Inness 'became con
verts to the Roman Catholic' faith, 'took
the narrow step from the -â¢/Hlgh'^church
to the Catholic church, and Mr.'] Inness
cf course cave up his church; and -Mrs.
Inness the UttlÂ« rectory.- :l~?~: l~?~
Then- the story of Stephen. lnness and
Jila wife beganâ actively. ,/
As a'matter of fact jt" had : begun : long
fceforeâ in Stephen Inneks* boyhoodâ
subconsciouslyâ ln the springs of being.
.Supplied with ample means, untrou
bled and unharassed by the sordid cares
of life, they made them a beautiful
home out on Filbert and Lyon streetsâ
the very last- house on Filbert street.
They bought them an ample lot, and
built a high board fence around lt,' f and
set a quaint, rooms', pleasant, redwood
shingled house well back from the
street on its highest part, so that their
wild garden runs down between -their
door and* the street and they command
an uninterrupted view of the bay and
the Golden Gate, and the hills of Marin,
as far as the eye can travel.
All that an exquisite, cultivated taste
and money can , do was, done for their
home, and. peace "and "comfort - and
beauty dwell within. So, too, do. cheer
fulness and* harmony and the spirit. of,
N home.
Mr. and Mrs. Inness possessing so
- many of the good things of life did not
set themselves to a selfish, exclusive en
joyment of them. \u25a0
â¢ Having no children of their own they
adopted a little homeless boy and a
young girl who. needed the care and
protection of a home, and another
young slrL now a young woman, be
cause she was motherless.
There was â there 6till Isâ a beautiful,
simple home life In that household at
the end of Filbert etreet. ; The young
girls flit through the beautiful rooms, the
'little boy races about the lawn and
bounds up and down the stairs in child
ish glee. The canary bird. in his cage
trills in an ecstacy of Joy, the big Per
sian cat sinks her claws In the deep pile
of a rug and purrs contentment.
A flood of sunshine pours through the
wide windows to add to the beauty and
cheerfulness, the flowers are abloom in
the garden, and in the distance the wat
ers of the bay are sparkling and 'r the
whltecaps â¢\u25a0 dancing.
The man and woman, still; . side' by,
side, walk and talk and study .together,
now as always in harmony ;" how as al-^

' Admiration for the charitable ar.4 re
lirlous work of his father Inspire* i a
him even as a bor the desire to do Uk 9
work. Although his father Is an Epis
copal clergyman, and his work lay la.
the field of hi 3 own church, the boy w&3^
strongly attracted to the Roman Cath
olio church and dreamed of taking or
dws and devoting his Ufa 'to religious
labors in that church.
In spite of or perhaps because of h!a
religious tendencies he was given as
liberal ah education as a young man
' can gt>t. He was a student at tha
University of Pennsylvania, and after
being graduated from that spent a year
In post-graduate work at the Univer
sity of Chicago.
Then, before realizing his boyish
dream of religious labors, the eommoa
fate of man' overtook him. He fell la
love, and married.
His father's church, mnca 'to hM
father's happiness, offered an opportu
nity for .work such as he had dreamed
of and that his wif a could share with,
him. He came here as rector of
Church of St. Mary the Virgin, and for
a time he was satisfied â almost . satis
fied. | ' ... . *'.'
Now and then the boyhood dreans
came backâ or, as. perhaps he would
say himself, tha Impulse that . tells
each of us what he must do stirred
within him. at first feebly, then .with
increasing insistence and frequency.
The faith to which his boyish heart
had turned drew him. the faith ha had
subscribed to seemed Inadequate.. Afr-^
ter , a time, he could not go on as reo- â¢
.'tor of the pretty little Church of St.
Mary the Virgin. He went over to tha
Catholic faith, and his wife went with
How strangely impotent we are in
molding our' lives In accordance with
our wishes.
Tho Innesses left the pretty -.- little
church and the charming llttleÂ».rectory
and builded them their beautiful home
out at the end of Filbert street and
settled themselves In it with all. that
delighted their senses. They took Into
this home and their hearts the children
that needed their care, and set them
selves to living a good and useful as
well as a beautiful life.
But to Stephen Inness It was not sat
isfying. - ."Â«Â»
\u25a0\u25a0? This, pleasant as it - was, - useful,
kindly and beautiful as it was. was cot
what the impulse within him bade him
do. _ ... ... .....
'" Tie" saw 'but the one* path. 'He felt
always, the force ,that was pushing him
toward. it. - â¢ - â¢- \u25a0
To shut -his eyes to .It, to avoid it,
was" to fail.ln the purpose of life.
This was his conviction."" .. . _
So thero came a day when Stephen:
Inness told this to his wife.
. Perhaps she had already divined* itâ
for there 13 little that can be hidden
from* the love of a woman.
However that may be, when . he show
. Ed her, the path that he must travel

So Stephen Inness* wlfa acquiesced.
And In doing so she did only .what

She. has. set .her feet to. follow. ' ..."
"JUnllke Stephen Inness her girlhood was
stirred by no religious Impulse, other
than that of a carefully reared child In
a Christian .household. She- dreamed of
no Ufa devoted to religious labors In a

<^*W RT In San Francisco gardens!
f I "Ha! ha! ha!" One hears the
l" I peering laughs of the scoffers.
J who have the gardens of most
of oar wealthy residents In
mind. Returned travelers from Ger
many and France tell of the beautiful
statuary they have seen in the palaces
they visited under the guidance of the
learned ones who show the sights in
"personally conducted" tours, rind they
won't believe you when you tell them
there are some rare bits of statuary to
be seen in some San Francisco gardens.
"WE never saw any." they nay. "where
are they?" And when you teli them,
they often enter and say the statues
here do not cut much of a figure. "Why.
in Italy we saw this and that." they
say. "and in Paris these and those."
It is quite true that no one would
make a pilgrimage to our city merely
to see our garden s-tatuary, but there
are. nevertheless, some line bits in the
grounds of some of our cultured resi
dents. _ Of course, every one knows about
thÂ«Â» plaster images and copies of famous
statuary in the Eutro gardens overlook
ing the ocean beach. Very few of us
do not remember the derision those
statues received when the late Adolph
Sutro had them set up in his wardens
and arranged about the parapet. It
was said then that it was ridiculous
for a millionaire to buy plaster copies
when he might as well have bought
marblt s. However. those statues in
plaster are very good educator* if one
will. only stop to think about It. Xear
ly all the famous works of European
sculptors of the olden time are there
reproduced, and if you never expect to
go abroad and see the originals, why
ifot get an idea at least, near at hand,
of what the famous works consist? The
form is all right: what is lacking is
only the unperishable substance.
Tears ago. most of our millionaires
\u25a0who built homes here would have
thought their gardens incomplete with
out their bits of marble or bronze to
vary the rows of Rowers and the level
stretches of lawn. There -were few
gardens then that did not contain at
least a. bronze dog. Others had marble
fountains, and connoisseurs sent to
Italy or France for copies of famous
nudes. Very few of these gardens are
now in existence. The march of pro
gress has caused the demolishment of
many, ami the erection of tall. Inartis
tic flats hr.s sent the pour bits of
artistic embellishment to the lumbtr
room or the dust-heap.
Now that Architect Burnham is to
make us a City Beautiful, probably the
garden statue will become more com
mon. As it is, there arc some gardens
that contain fine statuary, which the
owners prize and would not uproot
from their positioj s. Here ar.d there
one sees the perfect form of tho Venus
or the classic features of tLe Apollo
Belvedere, twect-faccd Daphne in her
nymphlikc attire, or Cupid with his
bow and arrows. Several gardens have
bronze dogs, guarding tbÂ« lawn. ...One

in de country we has a head
garOncr and a half a. dozen men to help

table from de city. We has a hothouse
for de winter, and a two-acre lot for de
summer, where all de flowers wit long
names are took care of by de men. Dey
takes such good care of 'em dat we
never sees any cf 'em in de bouse, and
de bills for flowers dat we pays de city
ilowcr shops would suit me for me
wages for life. But Duchess, she sees
a paper on how to be your own tjard

ting in the woild was to make money
growing flowers. I should ti:iK it would
lÂ»e if you could grow 'em. Dcre was a
picture of a. swell lady trimming her

took Duchess' eye. It took all de skin
off me hands before we got done. De
Look told how a royal Princess . In mfwv

Well. Duchess, she gets a book print
ed, by de seed man, and, say, it was a
beauty. Wit one or two of dose books in
each i-uoia of a home what is de use of
J'oivcrs? Dey is pretty enough alone,
Duciiccs, she mulls over de book,' and
makes a list of seeds, and when de
rackayes come we gets busy. We, I
tells you, for Duchess says she would
let me in on de profits, and I could buy
a flat in Harlem and have de rents for
me spending money. I wish I had de
money we spent for de seeds.
Foist we was to loin to woik de game
so as to get rich. It sounded easy. "Sow
in <Je open border," says de programme
printed on de seed . bags, "from April to
June, tin out. and transplant, giving 'em
plenty of room, or. In de hot house,
whence, set out simply in open pots.
<md replant in beds wit sunny exposure,
keeping wc-11 cultivated and free from
grubs and woims and protecting from
winces mi well grown and den plant
where dey is to stay until ready for
pickling or sending to market fresh,
plucking in de morning before 5 o'clock,
and getting to the shops before sun-up,
or oddcrwise, if desired."
"Exquis!" says Duchess. "Enchant
ant!" she says in her French langwudge.
and she tells me to get a shovel.
Well. I goes to de border where de
Scotch gardner had dug up de ground
and put out some of his private old stock,
and I begins to stick dc seeds, in de
nice soft cart. Not for long. De gard
ner he looks in. I never '"knew what a
good langwudge de Scotch is for saving
tings. My, my! He tells us to go chase
ourselves and dig our own ground, and
not fuss ar.d spoil where he'd dug.. Only
he wasn't Quite so polite in his wolds.
Duchets tries to get , next to him. but
it wouldn't woik. Dey got ' so mad Mit
each odder dat neider could speak Amer
ican or English, only make faces,', so' 1 1
says we -would go back behind de house
and do our digging. We gets chased off
from dat lot by de laundress, who Is
Irish and a good strong speaker!
.Duchess was too tired to do any more
dat morning so ehe passed: de" job .up
to zse. and I goes down to a . pasture,
where I only gets chased by a. bull, and
does me planting. I never taught . be
fore, dat nice, soft sod could - be . so hard.
I , taught I could dig . up *an acre before
breakfast, but when I'had all de . blisters \u25a0
I needed for one day I only had a- post
hole free of sod and ready for me seeds.'
Duchess came out to look den, and
asked why didn't I plow de ground in
stead of digging it wit. a shovel. "Be \
a plowman, and sing a song and recite ,
some lines of poetry, and uen you will
be like df happy farmers in de books." -J
I tells her 1 . would ladder be like de \
happy farmers on de Bowery lor a little
time, if it was ail dc same tiny to her. (

Duchess, she had a shoit sL<J:t/ like ue
Princess who bought de automobile, a hat '
trimmed w:t yellow ribbons a mile long, \
and white gloves lovely to look at.
">Tgw. me dear." I says, ">ou.iake de

Ac de foist sod I toincd over.^Duchess
let* out a yell, and jumpd to beat a iccuiu. '
It was ae- woims. 1
"Mon Dieu:" she > says, "we can't plant

De book fcayt, 'A nice sandy loam,' and
notting about a den of snakes."
"On your way woman!", I says. "Dose
is fish bait, not shakes."
But I had to pick out de woims from
catii sod before she'd tickle It wit.a hoe,
and we didn't make more dan a couple
of post holes more before' Duchess got
a glass arm, and said she would sit by.
me side and encourage me in me labors,
and -lat would do more good dan for, her
to soil her gloves.
We knocked off for breakfast, and for
Duchess to send to de -village for water
ing pots and tin fail. "We iiiust water; de
flowers every morning belore sunrise, she
says, and I said we would, when we could
see 'em to water. \"And," "says jshe, "be
fore we send 'em into town to be sold we
must wtap.'cm around wÂ»t dis tin foil."
"Good work," I says. "Give me. an-,

It was about a week before we got,

priceless works of art. A marble
statue of a woman has often drawn
a'dmlring eyes. One day a painter who

he would Improve the statu*. which
appeared to him to lack a proper

IN viewing the wonders of natural
scenery it constitutes no small
sharo of the pleasure to understand
the cause of the departure from
ordinary conditions, and the following
brief un technical explanation may bo
of Interest to tourists who visit the
Grand Canyon of Arizona and wish to
know why the Colorado descended to
the sea with more telling results than
many larger rivers.
The famous rift created by Its prog
ress is 217 miles in length, 7000 feet I
in depth and 13 miles in average width. â¢
In that exceedingly remote geological
age, known' as tho primary period, the^
highlands kof Arizona, in which the <
Grand Canyon has since been formed,
were under water, and the different
layers of rock, which we now see in the 1
variegated wall 3. were being slowly and <
successively deposited as sediment.
This process was also continued during '
the secondary period. Then, from aome I
causeâ perhaps the pressure of molten
matter beneath the crust. of the earth
the area' was slowly uplifted above the I
water. Indeed, there Is geological evl- ,
( dence that this change from a subma- '
rine to an upland position occurred |
1 twice. On the second occasion a lake
,was formed. This 13 supposed to have'
taken place In â¢ the early part of the 1
' less remote age. known a3 the tertiary ,
period. This lake found an outlet, a
northward tilt bx the uprising land'
probably. molding the direction of eas- Â«
1 lest descent. The upheaval of the soil
, was an exceedingly slow process, but It'
kept up a supply of steepness, through'
which the> water effectually carved its,
, rocky bed; the velocity and capacity for
| carrying sand and stony fragments be- '
Ing increased with increased declivity. ,
This brings to mind the indispensable
, share that; the law of gravity has bad
in the formation of the Grand Canyon. '
' since the initial surging 3 of the new
. born river through the uprising land
to the present day. The debris of the
1 arid soil with which its waters were
, laden, but not overweighted, proved a '
deft graving tool even for the hardest'
of .known rocks â ancient archaean
, through which the river now hews Its '
sunken channel. This persistent fric- '
t ion has had a zealous ' co-laborer in

! chiefly rain work. While the river
water corroded downward, the rain
water eroded the growing cliffs Into
I the sloping chasm that we see at pres
ent; thus, though th\e width of the
1 Colorado is " estimated In hundreds of
1 feet, the upper layers of the enclosing
( walls are many miles apart. Reliable
authorities assert that this washing
1 away of the soil has taken place on
l such an extensive scale that 9500 feet
of strata of the early tertiary period
'and or the secondary period, through
which the Colorado first cut Its -way.
were swept-- down by the rain and car
ried seaward. We learn then that
I while the still upstanding sides â¢ are
composed of rock formed in tho far dis
tant primary age, tho career of tho
) river and its labor of cutting Its way
through these ancient rocks belong to
the tertiary age. To this less remote
time is also attributed tho washing
i away of strata which, if still standing
would nearly treble the height of tho
} walls. Vishner's Temple and other
} colossal sculpturlngs that have Â»r
> vived the swirling floods within tho
' chasm are monuments to tho durability
i of the earliest strata. - An extensive up
, heaving area so constituted and molded
as to chiefly favor the formation of ono
'downward outlet, an arid soil and tho
f resultant corrosion, these are tho
[ agents that havo given to this Western
slope a natural wonder unmatched in
Europe, Asia or Africaâ to our planet
a rift surpassing in sizo tho cliffs on
tho rugged surface of the moon. â¢
The prevailing reddish hues aro not
innate to the rocks themselves, but aro
the work of ages past, as countless ad
mixtures of iron tinctured the rain
drops and impregnated tho llmestono
and sandstone beneath In picturesque
\u25a0 symmetry. The width of these layers,
which still tower more than a mils
above the water, has been estimated as
follows, given in tho order in which
the river wore ' its pathway through,
them, commencing at the rim: Tower
Limestone, so named from tho large
round crags with which it is frequently
o'ertopped, 1000 feet; banded sandstone.
800 feet; red wall limestone, tho 'most
conspicuous section of the facades, 1600
feet; sandstone grooved *In numerous
alcoves, 700 feet; cliff sandstone, "500 \u25a0
leet; variegated- quartzites, 800 feet;
black gneiss, tho chief object of cor
. roslon in tho present time, 800 feet. As '
'this latter substance (the hardest,

I V ROSE O'HALLORAN. !JOTTINGS OF OLD LIM JUCKLIN
*\ If OUXG Talbert had returned from
/ I college. Old Talbcrt Invited tha
IJ neighbors to break bread with the
e_ -I scholar. The day was warm and
the table was spread beneath a
tree in tha yard. Old Lim was requested
to preside as toastnaster. 'A redheaded
boy, catching the word, looked about for
the toast and asked Ills mother why they
had not brought it. She pinched him and
commanded him to hush. He howled Just
as the Rev. Mr. Kaney bowed his head
to aak a. blessing. Old Mrs. Talbert
cleared her throat end whispered to a
neighbor: "Haw I'd Ilka to blister that
littla wretch, and if he was mine I
would." As soon as Mr. Haney had said
"Amen," the boy shouted for toast with
molasses on It. "Tfcere isn't any toast,
you little imp," his mother whispered so
loud that every one could hear.
"Well, what made 'em cay there was,"
ha whined. "Want toast with molasses
on it"
ms mother matched him up and car
ried him behind the house. yFhey heard
the sounds of a slipper ardently ap
plied, heard the boy howl; and old
Mrs. Talbert leaned back, with a
satisfied expression of countenance.
Tha woman returned and Jammed
the youngster down into a. chair. Then
she wiped his face and kissed him. He
muttered something tuat sounded Ilka
toast and sfce gave him a hard look. Then
he wanted pie. She told him that pla
came after a while. He wanted pie.
"Do let the little fellow have pie," old
Mrs. Talbert pleaded, and after giving it
to him whispered to her neighbor: "Now
I wish he was mine."
Now the meal proceeded without in
terruption and without incident save
when old Briz swallowed something the
wrong way.
The young women were all of them keen
to note the student's college manners.
They looked at one another when he
brought out the new pronunciation of a
word, and when he caid, "I kawn't under
stand," they nudged one another and
tettled It. among themselves that -he
would surely make a fine doctor, the,
profession that the old man had chosen
for him. Old Mrs. Hankins wanted to
know what church he favored now that
he had .learned so much, and .ha
answered:
"Aunt Liz, I've decided that I can't at
tend any of them, you now. I fail to
bring myself -down to the belief in the
divinity of Christ, you know."
There was a falling of knives and
forks. The girls lookedj at Mr. Haney.
The preacher shook his head slowly and
was eilent. The student's mother -shut
her lips tight. The woman whose boy
had howled for toast now whispered in
her turn, "I'm thanful he ain't mine." ,
Old Limuel called for the welcoming ad
dress. Mr. Nacey having been honored
with this office, arose and In a restrained
' and embarrassed manner strove to cay
something, floundered about and sat
down. Then young Talbert sprang up
blithely and recited his written oration.
Other men and several women followed,
touching upon numerous subjects of in
terest to the neighborhood, but it was
evident that young Talberfs answer to
old Aunt Liz Hankins had hardened tha
eplrit of the feast. Aiter a time old Lim
eaid, speaking to the medical student:
"Joe, you haven't yet arrived at the age
when you can appreciate Jesus as a man,
to say nothin* of his bein* divine. Some
of these so-called learned fellers will tell
yon that there have been a hundred cruci
fied Christs, but It's not true. Now Just

"Has she dimples and brown eyes?"
asked Tom Innocently.
Ills sister flung him a scornful glance.
â¢Tou ought to know. You have been

"Well, a fellow's got to. do something

easily. "Tou can't expect him" to turn

more often the. critic of error than the

Haneyâ l am not walkia* down the lane
of any creed." .
"But you are asserting your belief,"
said the young man; "and what is a be
lief but a creed?"
"Well,' there's a difference. A creed
is a belief hardened beyond the possi
bility of additional growth. A man
hemmed in by a creed may refuse to
look In a certain direction, fearin* that
he might find a truth opposed to that
creed. I'm not hampered in that way.
Show me a truth and I strike at it like
a black bass. Now I reckon In your
readln' you must have come across a
good deal of what they call philosophy.
And each one of thÂ» philosophers tries
to put forth a sort of religion. He says
he's a-searchin* after truth. But what
is the object of truth If It doesn't en
able, folks to live better? If a philo
sophical religion doesn't help you to
bear burdens, of what use Is it? I've
read a good many of these philosophy
books in the past ten or fifteen years.
I didn't have much education, as you
must ', know. I didn't appear to need it
as long as I found my keenest pleasure
in game chickens and race hosses. But
as I began to get sorter old I found
that I didn't have enough things to
think about. So I turned to readln*;
and th* more of the great books I read,
gatherin* them up from far and near,
the- more I found out that Christ was
not only the friend of the poor man but
the only friend the king ever had. And
he said more In a few words than all
of the philosophers from the buildin' of
the ! pyramids down to the, potato hill
that old Brlz made'wlth his hoe,yester
day. 'I'm a-talkin' young: feller. 'We'll
Just let the divine part go, if you want
to, arid still ha ought to be worshiped
by: every maji, woman and child."
"You should make no such concession,"
said the preacher. "You destroy all by
doing so. for if Christ were not divin%
\u25a0on of Immaculate conception, he was
nothing. He came that souls might be
kept out of the roaring fires of torment."
The old man shook his head. "Can't
turn loose that torment idea, can you?
You put me In mind of old Jake Sanders
--don't mean you are like him, but Just
cause me to think of him. There was a
revival, meetin' goln* on over at Ebenezer
catnp r gf ound, and old Jake's wife got
after him to go up to the mourner's
bench. But he held back. Finally she
got. one of the preachers . to take hta
down Into the woods to talk to him. They
sat down on a log. 'Did you ever see a
house burn up?* the preacher- aake'd.
'Yes,' answered Jake. And the preacher
said: TVell. that ain't nothin'. Did you
ever see the woods on fire in August T
â¢Yes. I have.' answered Jake. "Well, that
want nothin*,* said the preacher. There
is a fire that will make a house burnln'
and the : big woods a blazin* in August
look no bigger, than a , pin-feather
a-scorchin'. I mean the fire of perdition.'
Jake's eyes began to stick out. 'You
don't say so,' said he. 'You hear me,*
answered the preacher, *and among the
gamblers over at. Purdy the bets are a
hundred to ona that you'll go there/
Jake took off his straw bat and began
to fan himself with It. 'Yes,* the preacher
continued," 'and "you'll burn down there
for more than a million years.. Jake
dropped on his knees beside the log and
began to pray. Well, it was announced
that bavin' come through he had relig
ion, and his wife went singin' about her
work. Jake hummed a little, too, but
after a while he began to think of what
the preacher had said. About ten miles
off there lived a preacher that was con
sidered the biggest one in the county; so
Jake catches bis mule and rides over to
see him. He told the preacher that he
had professed religion all \u25a0 right, but that
he was still In great distress over that
fire. â¢ HÂ« .was so wrought up that the
preacher, taking pity on , him. assured
him that there wasn't any fire. Jake roda
home In great glee, and a few days later
.was \ convicted of stealin' sheep and sent
to. the penitentiary. And so. Brother
Nacey. you are afraid to assure us that
there is <no fire. Will somebody be kind
enough to give that boy another piece of

he could go In a fight, for I remember
this friend of mine as a stayer. I saw
him work his way through a crowd of
toughs one day out at the Point in South
Boston, and he hardly needed the help
1 was able to give him. It was a caso
where he had to nght, and when I asked
him about that and if he wasn't a pret
ty good Christian with muscles, he beg
ged to be excused from remembering
anything 50 worldly.
"I guess that if any of the natives
cant be brought around by fair words,
you have the other kind of argument
to reach them." I told him through the
car window as we said good-by once
more, maybe for the last time.
Refusal of a Job to Guard a Wall
- _ . . Street Panic- Maker. 'â¢â"*\u2666
One day when I was in Harry Hill's
place in New York, a fellow called me
out and putting a $100 bill Into my hand,
"There's a retainer, as the lawyers
cay. and if you want it, there's a lot
more of the same kind of shaving papers
where that came from."
It looked easy, and I asked him what
the answer was.
"You have heard, of course, of the
panicky doings in Wall street," the man
with the green wt*it on, "and a certain ,
gent is accused of doing it aIL He is
afraid to move about, because somebody
has passed the word to John Kelly and
the police won't give him any protection.
Now, here's where you appear. If you
will agree to be in this man's company so
that if any trouble is started you can
stop It and protect this man, you will
ret $1009 for the job. We figure that the
trouble will pass over in about a week
and the money Is yours."
I declined the job right off quick, be
cause I knew some friends who had got
squeezed and I was sore on the one
ea'd to be to blame.
"Would 52000 help you to change your
mind?" asked the vistcr.
"No, nor $13,000." I replied. "If your man
deserves a licking, he can have it for all
cf me, and I hope he will get it good."
I heard afterward that the man who
m-anted to use my punch at a price hired
a couple of men. who knew how to shoot
to give him elbow room to finish the job
he started in to do on the public.
Cfeansre* for the Better.
Say. take It from me that this is a
great country. On my travels, I meet
the high and the low, and everybody,
seems to be making good. The rich are
getting more than belongs to them, but
the man who works is better off than
ever. The farmers out here In the West
live like fighting cocks and the gold
brick artists are not separating them
from their bank accounts as easy as they
were, for the farmer gets the papers and
Is a vtry wise guy. Anybody with a
scheme has to show them before they un
buckle. And the n^an who works for
somebody else puts In fewer hours and
gets more for his sweat than his father
did.
Sure there is kicking and strikes, but
to-day the working man has more for his
childrenâ better furniture, better food,
better fun. and an easier time generally
than his father could produce. And his
wife has It easier than her mother did,
for all kinds of wrinkles are now handy
to cut out the punishment for the
women.
I see these changes in this new country
of the Northwest eince my last visit out
there. There's something besides booze
to fill In the spare time, and " everybody
is the better for the change. - The ' big
fair out here in Oregon is another sign
of the changes, and this belated testi
monial to the two men who hoofed it out
here to prevent anybody Jumping the
claim on Uncle Earn Is not any too ex
travagant, even if it does seem top
splendid for a new country to settle for.

I flashed my roll to see him crawl, but
he was same, and going: into the bag

plug hat and handed It to me. I had
sever seen one of these before, and It
shook me a little when I saw it. but it
was up to me.
When we reached the town, there was
a crowd waiting to see me. and when
I got off the train In my sealskin coat
and this white plug hat. a roar went upâ
the -usual roar that I raised everywhere
In the West in those days. I wore the
hat - around all day and to please the
drummer had my picture taken In the

the ; hat and the drummer gave up his

to keep the hat "as a tribute ' to your

Queer Ideas of Men He Has Kaockcd
Out.
I have seen & good many men put down
and out. but those I've nursed into naps
seemed to take It different from others.
One man. a Frenchman, who went
against me In Astoria, after lying In a
sleep for ten minutes, got hip and ran
out of the hall and into a brick wall on
the other side of the street, where ho
put himself out for the second time.
Another fellow, whose name I will pass
up. came out of his doze saying In a sort
of whisper; "He Isn't as big as he
looks, be isn't as big as he looks; knock
his bead oft. knock hi 3 head off!" I
suppose he had been -sayins that over
and over during the: fight. to give bim
eelf" courage, and kept it up after the
trouble was over.
One chap in a Pennsylvania .town I
slapped with the palm of ray glove and
settled him that way. When he camÂ©
out of It. he said to one of his seconds
who was holding a sponge soaked with
Ice water to the back of his neck:
"Have the steam pipes busted V There
was such a roaring in his ears, you see.
At a private mill In Bostoa la my
early days my opponent, after setting
his. insisted that I had kicked him la
the head when he was down, and It was
some time afterward that he was con
vinced that a wallop with the fist had
done the business for him.
."Don't ever hit another man as hard
as you hit me, John." said Paddy Ryan
to me after our fight, "for If you do.
you'll kill him."
Mlstah Jack Johnson* Balloon Has
Gone Up.
Mistah Jack Johnson's balloon went
up when he failed to put Jack Monroe
away in Philadelphia, and if the sun
burnt scrapper ever thought. he had a
look-in for the biff fellow's belt, he
must give up the dream. Monroe was
an accident from the time he got that
four-round decision over Jeff, as Jeff
showed him later on In two rounds In.
'Friaco last . summer. The colored
brother was lively enough ' in ; pasting
Monroe, but he. hasn't the necessary
punch. All the Johnson-Monroe nght
goes to . show i 3 that white supremacy
will continue in the ring as 'well as out
of it. .-^MPMM WPSHPOMI
Monroe's defeat of Sharkey when the
latter had gone far back, and his defeat
of Pet^r Maher. who never bad the
heart of a fighter, never made the miner
anything better .than a second-rater,
and If Johnson was unfortunate enough,
to go up against Ruhlln. Fits or Gard
ner, he'd. let white fighters alone If he
cared to preserve his beauty.
As I have said . before, the negro
boxer, while some of him may be pretty
pood, none of him Is as good ,as the
white boxer. of the first class. . Peter
Jackson was pretty. good. but. he never
had: the courage to go, into the ring un
til he got Dutch courage out of a bo til?.
Monroe hasn't gained anything by tak
ing on Johnson and It would* be better
for the sport all the way through If ne
gro, fighters were kept -In a class b;*
themselves and not allowed to get their
chests Inflated by meeting men out of
their class.'

AND HER
WAIST WAIST
-
T -V "\ lIAT sha:i we wear?
\ A I How often we hear that
WY/ P at he*Jc puzzling ques-
X V tion! with the still more pa
thetic and puzzling answer
following it, -I have absolutely nothing
to wear."
Perhaps nowadays this plaint Is not
<TJ'te so often used as It was some years
aso. because thÂ« shirt waist has largely
helped to eolve th* auction.
In "mother's time" shirt waists were
not in voguÂ» and al! women were In a
dreadful plight all the time and were al
ways undc-cideJ what to put on.
They wore nlways like poor Flora Me-
Flimsey of 104 Madison square, who
BÂ«^Â«ufÂ« the had noihing whatever to wear."
Miss Flora had just been to Paris* and
had brought homeâ
r,, * lnler - *Pr!ris. summer and fall."
BLt no Ehlrt waists:) At least none are
mentioned In the Inventory.
There Is sphere her trouble originates,
for there are shirt waists for morning,
for afternoon, for dinner, for teas and for
the theater. Stiff shirt waists or soft
miT walsts ma< le of linen or lawn or
Bilk, with no end of variety, and in in
numerable different styles
Last year the sleeves were larg. and
bulging at the wrist; this year they are
big and loose at the shoulder, down to
tae elbow.
T nis Particular chance of fashion, un
like most of its sudden and complete
changes, is a convenient one, for all that
is neees.^ary to be done is to take out the
sleeves and reverse them, "end for end."
By that simple method a good, although
unfashionable, shirt waist Is again
brought within fashion's realm and made
new and pood again. As sleeves are now
60 often made elbow length, there can be
no danger In this process of reversing
them, of having them appear too short,
and the tucking that was used so much
last year at tne top of the sleeve will
now become excellent finish for the
Klecve cuffs this year. Fashion seldom
riovides any changes that can be ma.ie
with economy or ease. The changes are
generally dUÃcultj and expensive.
Iv California we can often wear
waists of thin material well into the
winter, which would be quite impos
sible in the coldor climates of the East,
and on this account California should
consider bfrself tlie leader of the shirt
waist fashions. In this Stata we wear
\u25a0waists longer anÂ»i better than other
American girls.
In New York and Boston the stiff,
conventional waists are worn. In the
Southern States young woman wear
lace ruches In loosely fitting waists, the
result of which Is they lack style, how
ever sweet and attractive they may be.
But here the shirt waist is shown to
Its best advantage. Consideration of
climatic changes being practically elim
inated, each one is at liberty lo wear
what is best suited to her own fig
ure and style.
Surely this freedom from constraint,
this emancipation from weather and
seasons, should produce the best re
sults.
la Boston â the headquarters of all
New England fashions a.nd fads â young
women eeem to aim at a semi-mas
culine appearance. The Boston waist
seems stiff and mannish, although it
must be acknowledged that they are
often stylish and attractive. They are
frequently made of linen and Entirely
without trimming and lit well to the
figure. The sleeves are modish, but
more likely than not they are rolled up
to the elbows and the arms are al
lowed to be burned to v distinctly than
nish brown. This tint is considered to
be attractive in Boston, but it is dif
ficult to understand the attraction.
Is it beciiusc there is a scarcity of
men hi Boston, \u25a0 that the girls seem to
endeavor to acquire a. "swashing and a
martial outside"?
The New York girl manages to com
bine some of the characteristics of Bos
ton. California and Paris in her make
up, all of which contribute to make her
a charming combination of womanly
grace and style. The waists that sho
wears are of all kiiuls of material, from
hand -embroidered handkerchief linen
down to heavy pique, and, whatever
material they may be made of. always
have a distinctive style and beauty that
proclaims New York. Hand o.mbroldery
is the n>ot>r for most of the New York
-waists, and it is certainly charming.
In Menlo Park, which is one of the
most delightful suburbs of San Fran
cisco, there axe always prettily dressed
women to bt seen, and on one of the
\u25a0well-known young: matrons there I saw
a very dainty and piquant waist. It
was made of the finest and most beauti
ful handkerchief linen, and at the neck
was a sunburst of dainty hand tucks.
Around th^se tucks, and running down
the front, a very elaborate pattern was
carried out in real Valenciennes lace in-
Bertiot:. The sleeves were elbow length
and liad two or three circular ruffles on
the bottom. Such a waist could per
fectly well be worn either in the morn-
Inj? or at lunch or in the afternoon. '
What at pity poor Flora MeFlimsey did
not have a trunk full of waists \u25a0 like
that! She would then have had some
thing to-wear. â¢<\u25a0;>* '}.
In France tlie women are much more
Inclined to wear gowns rather than
Kkirts and waists. It is only quitÂ«Â» re
cently that waists have been Introduced
Into. Paris as an item of dress to be
taken seriously, and oven now. they are
not adopted with the enthusiasm that
inlght b* expected. As a matter of fact,
the shirt waist is distinctly an Ameri
can Invention, nnd it Is hard to make a
fashion go from America to Paris. It
is too ilorJdodly a reversal of the regu
lar prooÂ«?<Ji'.rc.
However. Fuch .1 practical, convenient
and economical invention as the shirt
waist Is sure to endure. It fills what
advertisements sometimes call "a long
felt want," and American girls will not
be wtlling to g-ivft it up.
With a trood black skirt and two or
thr<-e well made, n^at and stylish shirt
waists wp ran always manage to look
\v<*ll dressed.
I cannot ordinarily classify vanity as
. a fault <n woman. It often means notn
i!ng\inor<Â« thaiÂ» the desire, to appear ap
propriately and becomingly appareled, -
Induced by a proper spirit of self re
spect No doubt, if carried to excess, it"
bfcoraes, like, other virtues carried. to
excess, a fault nut in that case. It Is
liable to run Into bnd taste, which is
something that vanity alone should
teach us to avoid.
This year Dame Fashion has decreed
that fine embroidered waists may be worn
well into the winter. As It Is necessary
to be protected from the cold, as well as^
to keep ln the fashion, an underwalst of
soft silk, made with high necks and long
sleeves may be worn. The silk waist,,
under the thin lawn, is very warm.. It
does not admit the cold air. In this moil
eiate climate the silk undcrwaists need
not be put on until quite late in the full,
for which we should be duly thankful.
The thin and embroidered shirt waists
certainly look very dainty over a low
necked "cache-corset."
The "peek-a- boo" waists lose the. sig
nificance that *i..c name Implies over; the
silk underwaists. A change of name will
be necessary in that case.
The dressmakers' league now seems
likely to lead us into all sorts of extrav
agances, and it has already selected the
shirt waistâ our cherished'and heretofore
economical shirt waistâ as the first point
of attack. The decree has been . Issued
that there must be no more mannish and
â¢untrimmed waistsâ that, on the contrary,
our waists must have all sorts and kinds
of trimmingâ that they must have hand
tucks and hand embroideriesâ and. in
short, everything that draws , upon our
slender pursts.'and that serves : to make
an up-to-date waist not so "much a neces
sity as a- luxury.*.' - â¢ . . \u25a0
That this Is, true, however great the
pity of It, can be seen In the fashion Jour,
nalsA* It, will be found there that: shirt;
v.aists must nowjbe made of. handsome
material, and so elaborate, as to require
the services of a skillful dressriiaker. ;No:
longer can simple. and untrimmed waists
be made of plain and cheap material at
home. '
This being the case, it Is more 'econom;
v lcal to - buy . waists than -to have . them,
made. They can be bought at various
prices, not .absolutely ruinous,; and? of -
_ various styles. ;'

two- bands of inch wide cluny lace in

. Butâ Shirt waist, once more! . .., - Â»
There are some shirt waists of handker
chief linen, with "embroidery, fine enough
for ahandkerch..!, and these walsts r are
very elegant, but very ' expensive. They
.must be bought, before **.'\u25a0 nc made "up,
and made to fit the figure.
The shirt w ists which are made of
grass linen are exceedingly charming.
Very nice ones, beautifully embroidered,
can be bought at the Chinese shops.
Grass linen washes very -nrell and wear*
well â better, in fact, than most other
material, so fiat, sLiyiough It Is quits
expensive, it is economical In the end.
Embroidered strips of linen can also b#
bought in the Chinese shops, and they
make excellent material for summer
belts. These, strips are about two Inches
In width, and they can be used for trim
ming as well as for girdles.
The Japanese embroidered silk waists,
although they are pretty and useful. arÂ«
getting al ost too common to be recom
mended now. Chinese brocade silk Is bet
ter, and makes up very handsomely, but
it is expensive.
A really good pattern for a shirt waist
is not easy to find, and when found and
proved to be suitable and becoming. It
should be kept. Changes to conform to
the prevailing fashion can always be eas
ily made in it.
Thi3 year collars are generally attached
to the waists, and are very soft and dain
ty. They are frequently, edged with a
little i ruffle * of . Valenciennes lace. ,
These hats are simple and easy to rnakÂ»
at home, and it may prove interesting to
tell .how It can be done. A bat.-frams
with a large round crown can be bought
for 33 cents. Cover this with tarleton
and provide an embroidered center piece
and an embroidered doiley to match.
These two pieces, which are intended as
part of the equipment of a dinner table,
constitute the lingerie that makes thÂ«
real lingerie hat. The large center piece
must be cut out in the middle and fitted
to the rim of the bat frame. The doiley,
when edged with Valenciennes lace, will
make the crown of, the hat. Around tha
crown a wide piece of soft satin ribbon
is to be tied with a large bow In front.
For the under part of the hat, buy two
yards of accordion plaited ruffling of
chiffon or lawn, and sew it deftly on the
bottom. Between the scalloped edge of
the linen and the- edge of the rufillnj
sew on an edge of Valenciennes lace.
Joining the top- and bottom. together.
This ,1s an .easy, ingenious and",lnex
pensive .way to. make a hat that would
cost more than $15 if bought, and the re
sult 'will. prove to be prettier and dainties
than any hat that can be purchased.PRACTICAL AID AND PRACTICAL DIVERSION FOR WOMEN

If you live in a city or town, canvass

D.URING the - second month the
" baby evidences signs of awaken

\u25a0 ...show .pleasure by smiling, .and
will turn his head in the direction of a
Bound./
It Is now,,undoubtedly a great tempta
tion for the mother and admiring? rela-
' tlyes .to talk to the i baby ; pretty con
stantly, shake rattles and other toys be-,
fore him, and pass him about from one
person* to ' the": other. : But , be careful
and moderate in the Indulgence of these

* \u25a0 It is a well-known* fact â¢ that babies ' of
\u25a0the 7 very c? poor, are >less- nervous than

child should not lie in a direct draught,

be aired this way for twenty minutes,
gradually increasing the" length. of time,
each day to one or. even, two hours. m
A hot-water bag may be- placet! at his

OXE of the most sensible,* of
modern fads is what a flip
pant talker called in my
hearing just now, "the
fresh-air craze." : '
I say "fad" with deliberate inten
tion. The Kins of Lexicons prives
as one definition of the fashionable
monosyllable. "An important matter
imperfectly understood, taken up
and urged with more zeal than
sense" â an interpretation that cov
ers nay subject to a nicety.
People who will tell you compla
cently that they are "fresh-air
fiends," meaning that they take fifty
deep breaths daily and an air bath
every mornine. standing in the mid
dle of a steam-heated bathroom with
one window open â sit habitually in
hot rooms, stuffy with stale air and
French perfumes; receive friends,
in broad daylight, in the scented
glooms of drawing rooms heated by
shaded lamps and, when one window
is let down an inch from the top in
their bedrooms, at night, draw a
screen between it and their beds lest
they should feel the draught.
Kight comprehension of the "im
portant matter" before us impels
yearly hundreds and thousands of
family men to buy or rent summer
homes, handsome or humble as their
means warrant, in locations remote
from popular caravansaries and
rural "neighborhoods."
ORIGINAL COST IS SMALL
Every season, too, more people
take real outdoor life' for two
months â some until frost dashes the
forest with vivid colo.* and crisps
livid grasses upon the hillsides.
Some are camps in name alone and
in rustic architecture more expen
sive than lowland brick and carved
wood. Others, and each year, in
larger numbers, make a "feast of
booths" of the hottest months,
dwelling in huts and tents. If there
be invalids or growing children in
the home of our man of moderate
means, he cannot do a wiser thing
than to transfer such of his house
hold gods as are represented .by
plenty of summer reading, a scanty
outfit of furniture and plain ward
robes to a family camp.

one may purchase all that is needed

V "r XLAftS ago, in what people of the
/ I speech might' call ;the
\_A ;*>aekwoods of Indiana, but what
*?_,-Â» deserves as rich a term us our
language will afford, there lived a. re
eppcta-ble farmer and his family, con
sisting of a wife and one son, a young
rnnn About 21 years of age. There was
a daughter at ouÂ« time In the family.
but she !-:id married and left it a few
yecr* before, Mr.- Morgan had given
her T -rr. rather, her husband-^â eighty
acres of laud at her . marriage, the
young man's father built them the
hoMse. an<l both together gave them
stexk sud Implements enough to start
hov*elcccri:ig: and farming with.
TiÂ»2 young woman was married at
19. but in that simple society enough
wui My experience to enable one to b".
the head of a family was acquired
car!y m life. The young: wife needed,
to Know how to cook, sew, make soap,
and tuch things; the husband to plow,
use :ui ax. ar.d make hay. These things
were learned early, because children
beiÂ»an <o work Â«aVlyv Little girls made
bread 12 and IZ, boys were hands in
tht- harvest field at 14 and 15. .
Although George Morgan was ; two
years younger than his sister, ha be
came no^scsscd with the desire to
marry soon after she left the home.
Her happiness Ui a cheap little house,
and everything her own, so affected
him that he. wanted, to try it. himself..
But this was not the only thing that
produced his desire; there was a. slen
der girl with a pale face, living: about
two miles away, that helped. . Jenny
was just the girl to fill a simple heart
and' caJl "out the" sympathy "that'ls the
foundation of love^; 6he was tall, -with
darir"b*r"oVni- tired "eyes that told of
the hard life she had led and of sor
rows she had had. Her father was a
lar.y. good-for-nothing 1 and a drunkard.
Her eldest brother, who had been lit
tle better, had died of consumption
when she Was 15.
Although George wanted to marry the
girl so much, he felt that ! his father
would not let him. Mr. Morgan bad no
use for an improvident man, especially a
man that would drink liquor; and, be
sldts, he had had some personal trouble
â¢with Wiggins. George knew this, and be
also knew that his father was most un
forgiving. Consequently for several years
he was' tossed "backward and 'forward be
tween his desire to marry and fear of not
getting his father's consent. He was con
tinually waiting for a more propitious
time.
One winter the young girl caught a deep
ccld that lasted until spring. A bright
red epot appeared in each of her pale
cheeks and her eyes looked deeper and
sadder than ever. Strange to sayâ or
perhaps it is notâ George wanted to marry
then more than ever, but this sickness
he knew would only add more force to his
father's opposition. But spring came,
and with it the return of the girl's health,
and In the middle of the summer, when
the was apparently well, George deter
mined that it was the time to have the
matter cut with his father one way or the
other. He told Jenny one Sunday after
noon that he was going to try to get his
father's consent, but she' begged him net
to. She knew everything was against
their marriage, and she reared the test.
But, George was determined, and with
badness she saw him depart for home. .
George turned In at the gate in front of
his father's well-built barn. He locsened
his horse's rein and patted her neck.
"Jenny, my beauty," he said, "now you
can let her down."
At the house he found his father.sit
ting in the shade of a tree, his coat off,
and his clean white shirt showing creases
from the Ironing. The old gentleman was
cot troubled with a. collar/he seldom
wore ko useless an article of clothing,
and certainly not on a warm summer aft
ernoon. "Well, which one have you been
to see' to-day, George?" he asked good
humorc<ily.
"3Jy best one," George- answered eva-
Nv t l;v > , . - "
"You don't look very enthusiastic. I
guess you found her other fellow there."
"So, there wasn't any one else there."
George found his mother In the kitchen
setting their cold Sunday supper. He
knew that getting his mother's consent
would be the smallest of his difficulties,
but he wanted her advice. He also knew
that the prospect of a quarrel between
him and his father would worry her, and
he dreaded to tell her. ',
"Mother," he said at last. "I've got
something I want to talk to you about. I
don't "expect you will like it very, much,
but it's important to me." He \u25a0 paused,
hardly knowing' what' to' say,' arid .then
stumbled on. "It's aboutâ do you think
father will give :ne a start like Anna?
I'm getting aluns nd^vâ l want to settle
down.". . - ' â¢
"You arc young yet, George." She 4 
thought he meant only to work for. him
self. "You are -well enough at home'
aien't you?" . <, '\u25a0'\u25a0 \u25a0
"I know; but I would like to have a
piece of land of my own and be working
for. myself."
"But your, pa needs you. and I need
you, George. Your pa's setting along in
' years, and who'll do things for. me if you !
leave? Who'll-bring in th 6 stove wood'
for me? If I had another boy or girlâ but â¢
you arc all I have got."
George traced the' figures on the; red
tablecloth with a, fork. -He Eaw^she'did
not 'guess what- he " wanted to Â«ay, and
he shrank from; telling her. .vMa.)I ;can't
stay here always. Don't youâ don't 3 you

ishing, "they had no more business get- "

oughtn't, to bo thinking about Any
thing like that- for. years yet."
This was poor ; encouragement, but he .
felt that he must have the truth out be- .
fore things got worse,* "That's just what
I wanted to talk about," he said, with. a
gulp. "Iâl do want to get married." He
did not dare look at his mother, but con- â¢
tinueJ tracing the figures.
Her voice almost failed her. "George,
you don't!!' But. she saw- by his actions .
that he was in earnest. "You -are- too
young, George.. You oughtn't to be think- .
ing about it yet." - \u25a0
"No. I am not, mother. I've got a team \u25a0
of horses of my own, and If father will '
give me a piece of land I could get
along."
The mother looked at him and shook
her head sadly.
"The sooner I start for myself the bet
ter start I'll have. Pa didn't own a piece
of land until he was S2 or 33., and he has
made a. good deal of money, but if he had
got a ; start earlier wouldn't he have had
more time to make "more?"
Mrs. Mprgan*knew there was a flaw in
Â»this reasoning, but she could not tell ex
actly what it was. "Who Is it you want
to' marry ?" ehe asked. ? :^ .
George hesitated; here was the real dif
ficulty. "W'y, it'sâ l and Jenny want to
get married. I know pa don't like Bill
Wiggins, but Jenny takes after her
mother."
"She's Jan invalid."
"No,; she isn't. She's well now."/
"Sho* was sick all last winter, and they
say. Elle's got the consumption."
George -flinched, at this bold: statement..,

would come out : here and lean over the

he saw a cow trying to take her calf:
through the gate, into the 'pasture, and^
his reverie was -interrupted. *
George's heart failed h:m. when the time
came, , and he put off saying anything

speeches and arguments '-. he imagined he
wouldfuse had-lcft him, or else seemed
absurd.^ He thought if he ' could' get'

When George left the house he went to
the barn. He had no 'definite object in

was the natural goal. for ; him in his
stupefied \u25a0"condition:". His anger had gone;
but. there had not come in the place of It
either sorrow or regret; in fact, complete
comprehension had not' come. He 'knew

that ; with ! his \u25a0 not being "there
in the /future; ;if did not seem:
that it would be' separating him. from his
mother, or'even his father. He sat down
oh a pllu of- lumber at the end of the

was very dark; perfect blackness again

"Oh. I '[,. George, \u25a0â¢ we f are â¢ all > interested ' In
you, |arid r want itoT seVjyouTdb !^ell." .
"Then you side, with pa," he said sul
lenly.
"Oh, no, I don't. I think he Is WTong
to speak so harshly. He ought to talk
|Wlth you and advise you, if he thinks
you are wrong, but he oughtn't to be so
harsh." She paused for a moment, and
as he did not answer, she went on. "Jenny
I Is an awfully nice girl, but pa thinks she
would be a burden to you because she
has got theâ because she is sick so much.
He doesn't : like the Wigginses, but he
wouldn't refuse if Jenny was well and
strong. A- wife can be a great help to a
man, or a great lcjad." -
"The load ,'uld .be on me and "hobody
else." George almost soDbed. As his
mother talked the hopelessness and sad
ness of his position canw to him.
;."I; ."I' know," she went on. "but you don't
know how; much we are Interested In. you.
You can't Imagine how much a father
and 1 mother love; their children and want
thtmto do ,weir# When you were a little
baby and lay In " your cradle I thought
: that I loved you so much that I could
not love you more, but I love you more
now than I did then*. You are a man. and
feel like a man; but you are little to us
; yet,';; arid , we want to guide and advise
you just the. same. We've had experience:
and know the ! hardships of : life, and we
would like to' give bur , knowledge ' to you
and save you as much sorrow and pain as
we can." .. : ,
She" paused and George said huskily:
"You aren't saving me much sorrow."
"But, George, we may be. Things might
be \ worse.!. You are : -young yet, and so is
Jenny. ; She may . get , well, and \u25a0 then you
can \u25a0 get married. ;v; v But I : won't I say any-.
.thing more about it now: let If drop for a
:', while." . . x _ -.â¢... ? - \u25a0!. -v ' "' . ..'â¢ " -'
With more coaxing, and encouragement
she 'succeeded in influencing him, and the :
;.; two ;went -to the house together. They \u25a0
j found Mr. Morgan reading . a paper. ..The
"; father's and 'son's eyes met in: a half-de
flant^arid â¢hal*-embarrassed -look. The
! young man sat i ln*- the back-room, .while
- the .father * continued reading. Neither
wanted ; to - make any advances; *, each
1 wanted to feel "that the other, was doing
the f bending.. -George soon went to, his
room,* and, 1 , the "others^, retired .not long
, after.'him.. The, next morning the rela
tions, though â¢ still /constrained, were
easier, arid became -'more* and more ,so
until at the end'of !a/wcek the two men.
' were', back in^ their old positions as far aa
appearances went. \u0084,!. \u0084. , :. >
- ;-, It .was on J one pleasant; day, in Decem
" ber,|abbut ; 4 o'clock."^ that the small -Wig
gins boy; cam* down the road toward the
-.; Morgans' "house. He went around to the
:back door, opened It and looked In, nsver
deigning to knock. Mrs. Morgan was la
the kitchen getting 'supper, and hearing
the door . open looked Varound. There
.stood staring at her % a small boy^that sha
did not remember having aeenbefore.
" "Howdy . do?" she * said pleasantly to
him. \ ,' ,
"Howdy?" -tbÂ« answer .cam* back.
" - '.'Wont you come in?" she asked him.
"Where's George?'' was bla reply.
"He hasnt't got home yet. Do you want
*> "Well,-, you will have to come- la and
wait until he comes. r He'll be here in a
. little bit. I think."
The child came, in and sat down in the
;chair she pointed to. '
-â¢"What do- you want to see George
- about 1" ' she asked . thinking she would
open a_ conversation with him.
"OhT'ndthin",** he answered.,
"Where do yon liver* she then aak;d
; him. '\u25a0: . \u25a0. â¢\u25a0 . \u25a0; â¢: \u25a0 . . â¢
"Over yonder," with a jerk of his' head
in no particular direction.
" Shedid not seem to be learning much,
but she was not discouraged. She brought
\u25a0-him "a cooky and asftert. "What's your
came?"
â¢ "Charley Wiggins." ',-;.' ,
;"Ohr" she exclaimed. Then the conver
sation'dropped* such as It was, ami she
continued getting supper.- while he 3at
an'd_ watcfied "her with .wide-open eyes.
Supper was almost ready when Georgs
-came in.^ Seeing the small boy sitting De
hind the .stove. Jie 'exclaimed. "Hsllo,
Charley; what you,doln* here?"
Charley said: "Ob," no thin'," handed
him the letter and went out of the back
door without any sort of a farewell.. Ha
had evidently had it drilled into him that
.the Morgans in general were a bad lot of
people.
George opened the note, read It* and
went out of the door after Charley, but
he was far up the road, hurrying homo
to get his reward. Seeing there was lit
,tle hope of overhauling J him. George
went to the barn and began saddling his
horse. His mother came out and. stand
ins in % the stable door with her apron
twisted around her head, asked what the.
matter was.. ;..'\u25a0 '.'â¢ : f - *Y.
"I'm going to the Wfgginses'; . she's
worse." And with a trembling hand he
tried to put the bit in his horse's mouth:
but. she had not yet finished her corn, and
coolly shoved his hand away to begin eat
ing again. George Was in no humor for
Euch playfulness, and slapped, her on the
.head." The sensitive horse leaped to the
other side qf the stall and looked at* him
in astonishment. She had never felt such
a -thing before. .?';â¢*
"You must come in and get some supper
before <you go. It's all ready." said Mrs.
Morgan. .
"I'm not hungry, and I haven't time,"
he said shortly.
He seldom spoke rudely to her and she
'knew- that -he must be greatly worried.
The horse was bridled and saddled. and
ready to lead out. when Georgof thought
. of the old clothes he had on.
. ~"I must change my coat," he said to his
mother, and ran to the house.
â¢ The horse began eating again with* the
bit ' in â¢ her mouth. Mrs. Morgan . patted
her neck and side 3. * -. â¢ '
"Jenny, my beauty." she said, j "he
slapped you, but he did not mean toâ no,
he didn't."
She thought of her supper and hurried
to the house. On the way she met George
coming back. jflMiMljlijpSfiffi
/'You won't be gone long, will you?" she
asked.
" "I don't know," ha said. "Here, read
this; I must hurry," ana c 3c 3 handed her
the letter, j \u25a0 \ \u25a0Â»â¢'".. : - i
The air was chilly, and she hurried to
the house before she looked into it; then
she read:
* "Dear George, the doctor' says that
fenny cannot liva through the night. â¢
PleasÂ© come quick.â Lizzy."
For a long time Mrs. Morgan sat still,
thinking of her unhappy son and her poor
neighbors. Tears 0* sympathy ran down
. her cheeks. At last, with a sigh, ah*
went into another room and told her
husband to corns to supper. At the table
she told him where George had gone, and
on what occasion. After supper the even
ing was passed . is silence. Mr. Morgan
went to bed as early as usual, but his
wife sat up waiting {or George to come
home and to give him his supper. ' But
he had not returned at 10 o'clock, and she
went to bed with a heavy heart. She
was awakened often In the night by
horses galloping along the road, but none
of them stopped at their gats. Nsit
morning when she sot up she went to?
George's room to see if he had come
home in the night, but the bed had not
been slept in and there were no signs ef
his return. She cot breakfast, while her
husband did George's morning work. She
delayed calling her husband to breakfast
as long as possible/but at last she de
spaired of George's co'mlng. and they ate.
They had barely finished their silent meal
when they heard a click of the latch of
the barn lot gate. They â¢aw George
leading his horse to the barn.
; After, he had fed her, he cams slowly
to tha house. When he camÂ» in, his'
mbtber^Took his hand and looked into Ms
eyes without saying anything 1 . He re
turned the look in a dazed sort of a way
for a short time, then burst into tears and
turned away.' She clung to his hand as
he dropped into a chair and htd his face
in his other arm on the table. She moved
a few dishes out of his way. and whis
pered her sympathy In his ' ear, ' for shÂ»
knew what had happened. With his facÂ»
muffled in his left arm he sobbed but his
sorrow father than talked.
."Oh. I'm a miserable wTetch! .She
thought I did not want to marry her. I
was ashamed to ten her that I put it off
because pa objected. She thought I
didn't "want to."
! Mr. Morgan eat at the other end of tha
table and played nervously with his eof
;.- fee . cup. \u0084 . : -. \u0084Â» ;
"And last night she said." he went on.
"'George, I'm going to postpone : it this
\u25a0time/I told her then that pa made me.
She looked bo happy. She said: TTÂ«ll
your pa that I'm sorry he didn't like me.*
She said:. Tell him that I won't bother .
him any more.*. She was easy at the last,
and "didn't" suffer any. She said she would
be - happy: where she was 'going, for shÂ»
would have a new body, and 'wouldn't ba
sick there, and that. when pa sees hÂ«r in
-heaven'he will not object to our marry*
v . Ing there.".' . ; . ... .These Are

WORLD'S GREATEST SWINDLERS CAUGHT
HAS SMARTEST
GOWNS IN ALL
LONDON TOWN
LONDON. July 22â Mrs. Patter Paltn
. er continues to be one of the smartest
dressed women in London, but* ; as she
has not fulfilled -the plans kindly de
vised for., her \u25a0 by.! her English friends
in the -. matter of grand entertaining
. they are .'growing somewhat .critical.
They propose' all : kinds of ' .ways of
spending \ her money; she appears;
pleased with their suggestions and. then
nothing more is heard 'of it. ! Modistes
and curio dealers' propose' to her costly
purchases; she iaT most favorably im
pressed, but remains strictly non-com
mittal. She may. relieve herself by do
ing something big at Goodwood \ or
Cowes, but Â£v far bas taken no steps'
in that direction. ". *â¢*"'
Several of the most popular American
women will not be seen either at Good
wood or Cowes. Mrs/ Anthony -Drexel,
for instance, who did such splendid .en
tertaining last August on .; her â¢; yacht
Margharita. will not be -at Cowes this,
yÂ«Â»ar, and the yacht is not' in commis
sion. " , - r .
Mrs. Drexel has left for Aix. and later
will, with her husband, go" to America.
It is a great disappointment to. her'
friends, for she is a most popular lit
tie woman and when she entertains
does everything in 'perfect taste.
Then Mrs. John Jacob Astor.iwho was
invited by Consuelo. Duchess of '.Man-.
Chester, to be one of her. party at
Cowes; will leave on "August 2 'for
America, and no one Is able to" persuade
her to alter her mind. Mrs. Ogden Mills I
will also sail about the same time. Mrs.
Chauncey Depew -will not be at Cowes, !
but will go abroad after Goodwood. Mrs.
Arthur Pagct is going to Carlsbad for
the cure, being forbidden to face the
fatigues: of Cowes week.
M/s. Cornelius Vanderbi'.t and her.
daughter Gladys, who have been having
a quiet. time in. town,. started yesterday
on a long motoring tour to? Scotland;
Flopping with the Roxburghes at Floors
Castle on the way. \u25a0 ; .
MiÂ«s Vandcrbilt has fretted a bit over
the dullness of seemg -no one; most 'of
the day -and seldom going out In the
evening to anything but a small - party
of private friends. She has now per--
Fuaded her \ mother to leave town and
they will probablyMand down- n*ta.T the
Deeiide before they, have finished.

The stranger and the inspector en
tered -, and 'passed â¢ through an ante
chamber, where a servant saluted them,
respectfully, i and then traversed two
rooms splendidly furnished with sofas,
desks.- safes and other fixtures. Here
were' three girls occupied in copying.
with: the; aid of typewriters.- various
letters, while four men were busy with
great account booL - When the trav

and saluted the latter with a respect
ful "Good * morning. S^nor Director."
v â¢ The "Senor Director." with a serious
mien,- told them to sit down again and
then added softly In Spanish. "This is
the German - fish I have hooked V Im
mediately "afterward he introduced the
supposed German' into an elegant apart
ment, the door of which he hastened
to 'close. "This is my private office."
he â¢ said to the inspector. "Pray be
seated.* sir. Here we can converse to
gether without any fear." So the offi
cer begged the "Senor Director" to give
him a detailed account of all the" cir
cumstances connected with the robbery
committed by the commandant, im
prisoned in Corunna. who was willing
to put him in possession of 500,000
pesetas in exchange for 5000 francs.
The swindler related the old story and
added that he was instructed to reveal
the "place where the money lay. con
cealed as soon as he had \u25a0 received the
5000 francs, which the commandant
needed for the education of his daugh
ter. : ; "' ' ; ' â¢-..,. :,

man." "The business suits me' and I

;; * '^ -mssÂ«lt cViÂ» : accÂ«pt' thes*'' cireques,"
said the swindler hastily. But for rea
sona easily Inspector Puga
r epl 1 ed :^ "No. :l; prefer, to :.present the
cheques. .personairy,. as they/amount to
much more than the 5000 francs and /I
Want to receive all the money. in gold.
Nevertheless. ; r should ' feel obliged! if
you would accompany me to the bank,
for I am " not kn^wn \u25a0 there, and besides,
I do. not know my way about Madrid."
\" Gonzalez consented and the two men
sallied forth again into the street, but
just as they turned the corner the sup
posed German saw a policeman stand
ing, near, whereupon he rushed upon
the swindler' and seizing him firmly,
cried; to 'the officer: "Arrest; this man

Did Otto Kawakami do . a Japanese
Hamlet here some, five years ago when
his samurai clattered across the. Cali
fornia stage? And if not. why not?
And when is it to be? Shakespeare,
plain, is out-moded, Bernard Shaw says
so and gives us "Antony and .Cleo
ratra," happily hibernianlzed. Ben
Greet adds piquancy by hob-nailing
his ghost's shoes and bringing him in
In broad daylight as in Shakespeare's
day. And an admirable good ghost It
was! And .we take our "Otello" .. a la
Verdi, and Mr. Gounod's ideas on "Ro
meo and Juliet." Then Julia Marlowe
almost . persuades to an intellectual
Ophelia; and is going to spring upon
us a Kate the curst, who is accurst
only when the sneakish Miss Bianca
riles her.
But all this is child's play to what
the Yiddlshers have done to Shakes
peare. Take the "King- Lear." ' Mr.
Gorfiin has thorn L*ar of his king
dom and Goneril of a crown. The King
becomes a Russian merchant and
Mamma Lear Is resurrected. Kent ap
pears as a philosophical anarchist with
a voice and Cordelia as an advanced
young woman with aspirations as a
doctor. Comic relief is Introduced and
again comic relief.
Even more remarkable is the "Ham
let" transcription, as I have already
said, "They begin â boo-hoo!â by blue
penciling the ghost. The dear old thing
is put on the shelf, exorcised, and, most
undignified - fate - for any ghost â laid.
Interesting reason is given for this
change. The Yiddishtx very practic
ally does not believe in ghosts. Not
of the Hamlet kind, that is. Hamlet
nls would suffer .incalculably in the
Yiddish eye "if he put his money on any
ghost tip," as one of them hath it. As
cordingly they have the "tip" in good
black and white, the story of the
uncle's crime being set forth in a docu
ment left by Father Hamlet to son.
King Hamlet appears as the beloved
rabbi of a Russian village. The son
Vigdor is studying to succeed to his
father's honors. King Claudius is the
plotting half-brother of the rabbi,
himself also a rabbi, Tudros by name.
Tudros marries Rabbi Hamlet's wife
six weeks after Hamlet's death. The
death of Hamlet is not violent, the
Yiddish audience objecting to gore. It
cannot be said that the manner of his
taking off is any more kindly with
Oriental subtlety being caused by Tu
dros and Polonius (the vtllaini) deny
ing medical aid to the sick rabbi. In
line with this Tudros Is sent to Siberia
Instead of being killed by Hamlet-
Vigdor.
Ophelia is Ester in the "Jewish Ham
let" and dies of her lover's cruelty from
heart failure instead of from suicide,
Hamlet ulso has another admirer in
Zinele, a blind girl, who secretly
lovos him. Pitz. the first gravedlgger,
supplies the comedy and has a daugh
ter who docs a song and dance with
Laertes! The play ends with the Ham
let marrying the Ophelia! The Ylddish
er does not let a small thing like
Ophelia's death interfere with the mar
riage, nor is it one made- in heaven.
The bridal canopy is htld over the grave
of. Ester and she becomes thus the
bride of Vigdor. This ceremony is fre
quently performed in actual life. It is
called the "black marriage" and is de
signed to prevent the heavenly sister
hood from gibing at the new inmate as
an old maid! Vigdor dies at the grave.
At this writing I have not yet seen
the play and am envying myself the
privilege.
It did not need Ellis T. Glickman,
who acts the King Lear and Hamlet
and who heads and manages the com
pany of Yiddish players, now presenting
the plays here, to tell me that the
sincerest reverence is behind these
adaptations. But he did so tell me the
other day. Shakespeare, -. he says, the
Yiddishers greatly admire, but kings
and ghosts, not being of their acquaint
ance, must be cut to fit the Yiddish
taste, \u25a0
"We like to give Shakespeare," he
said, "but we have to live. Just the
same after we have given the 'Jewish
King Lear' for two weeks we will giv*e
the original â In German, that is. And
how long do you think that will run?
Three days. But it gets the audience
to making comparisons. In every Jew
ish cafe and the cigar stands you
will hear- the Jews talking over the
two editions. It elevates their mind,"
says Manager Glickman.
A handsome, curly-haired, black-eyed
Yiddislier is Mr. Glickman, with a
freckled, contented countenance. He
wore' when I saw him â unexpectedly â
an undress uniform of gray, the coat
stone gray and speckled, the waistcoat
brown gray and plaid, the trousers
blue gray and striped. He wore them
with the fine carelessness of genius.
But across the vest hung a gold cable,
with a locket as large as a" small moon,
gorgeously bediamonded, depending
therefrom. Perhaps Mr. Glickman un-

consciously fingered his diamonds as he
told me of landing in New York not
too many years ago with Â»J1 95 in his
pocket, of lending" $1 of that to the Im
pecunious friend .with him, who never
returned it â perhaps because he is still
a chorus man. Four days later Glick
man was in the streets. After that he
took in 60 cents a week "suplng" in
the Yiddish Theater, four nights a
wek at 15 cents a night. -
"Sixty cents a week clear is not the
worst." said Manager Glickman,. "but.
I was paid in gallery tickets and had
to sell them before I got the money!"
"You lived on 60 cents a week!" I ex
claimed.
"For three months," the actor said.'
"Of course, you can't call It living. The
nights I slept \u25a0in cost me 15-cents
apiece. The others " Manager*
Gickman took a newspaper from the
table at his elbow, ...and carefully
wrapped up to his knees in it, he took
another and blanketed, more of himself,'
until he -looked like a 'Santa Claus
parcel.
"Yes?" was my bewildered comment.
"Don't you know?"â began Mr. Glick
man, with good-natured contempt for
my ignorance, then explained that
that Was the way you sleep -in: New
York on -an ' income of 60 cents. The
park is your, bedroom, a bench your
bed. a newspaper, your coverlid. Here
toafter I shall always have respect for
the press.
One does not like to, think of what
lies behind Mr. Glickman's last words:
"You have to sit up to it, you know;
they won't let you- He- down."
. Yet the actor says that he regrets
none of it, the pain, the hunger; that
\u25a0THE- SAN JFJ^NGISgO^CALfe^SUND^
he so learned. life as otherwise he could
never have learned it, and further that
60^ cents a .week in-New York was bet
ter to him than dollars In Kiev,
where he . lay shuddering in a garret
during one of the big massacres. It
may be to. these; things' that Glickman
â¢owes the warm humanity, charity,
tolerance, comprehension that distin
guish-him. also ' the business faculty
that makes him" the most successful
Yiddlsh.managerout of New York.
And Glickman. is proud of it, proud of
the \u25a0 Yiddish drama, and what it ' stands
for. .
"Our. stage is . the youngest in the
world," he- put it. -"It was. founded only
twenty-six years . ago. The man that
originated it is In New York to-day,
Abraham Goldfaden. Twenty-six years ago
the women's. parts were played .mostly by
menâ couldn't "get women 1 actors. Well
I, remember one of them! He was a big
imahlwlth a' big beard,; and -wore'a red.
handkerchief over his chin when he
played! To-day you have a Bertha
Kalish. And ' to-day we : have -a '. Jacob
Gordinâ they call him the Yiddish Ibsenâ
whose 'Kreutzer Sonata' Blanche Walsh Is
going to do, a Joseph Latierna,' a Profes
sor Hurwitz, a Shomer-Shelkewitz, a
\u25a0 Thomaslefsky, besides others. Then,"
Mr. Glickman elaborated, ''the: New York
Yiddish theaters make, a clear quarter, of
a million profit yearly." ,
\u25a0 ;"On supers at fifteen' cents a night?" I
asked. ...
\u25a0 ."And ['{ stars up \u0084 to ", $20,000 a year," Mr.
Glickman "added. . \u25a0; .; - t '-.;' : â¢'. â -,- ;
"Isn't' that characteristic,"/ 1 laughed,
"economy , and extravaganceâ *â¢
- ;",'Tis so," said Glickman, laughing, too.
"I once let my leading lady go for a" dol
lar a week myself, just wouldn't i give,; it
to her. She'd asked for. a : raise, and' said
she wouldn't stop without one. She asked
for, Just. $1. to save her; word. But, no
sir, 1 \u25a0 let her go. Lost me dollars, more
in the end and I knew it would."
That they ha<J had the Yiddish drama
even in Kiev he told me then, also that it
was "not so classic as ours." But it was
prohibited by the' Government: some J time
ago . for suspected -â¢ revolutionary.-.tend
encies. It' is again , to be permitted, he
thinks/ -No, It was not.in < Kiev he; began
to act, but in- London; where he ;was for
some*y<?ars at the Yiddish Theater. There,'
too. was Joseph Adler, the famous Jewish
Shylock,' in whose company,, both in^Lon
don: and New; York," he had played for
six years. \u25a0 "He .was :. my "master." said
Glickman, very proud of it.
I don't 'knew how ; the foiled-again; vil
lain came ; up,", but the actor ; told''me ' he
was scarce in the Yiddish drama. V
I liked the way; -I told him," that they
"let r down" j the villains in the plays, even
the bad Gentile Prince; in "Gabriel," who
repents in t\\e>. last act: But I thought the
Central gods would ? riot approve,: ariJ
wondered if "the Yiddish: gods did. ' ...
"Sure.'.'i said Glickman. "You know eacli

HEIR TO 10,000 ACRES
. IS VERY HARD UP LNDEED
Yonns Lord Brook*, Who Some â¢ Day
Will Be Earl of Warlck, Seeks
Rich AVlfe.
LONDON, July - 22.â Young" Lord
Brooke, heir to the Earldom of War
wick and the fine old castle and 10,000
odd acres , thereto appertaining. ! U
hard uo. The Interest in that state
ment for American readers lies in the
fact that the prospective Peer's iinpe
cunioslty spells opportunity, for the
American heiress. Lord Brooke, I havo
heard, has been trying to raise money
in the city, and his experience there
has convinced him that unless he weds
a rich ' girl the financial outlook for
him is a rather dismal one. An Ameri
can girl, with a few millions of papa'a
dollars at her disposal, might do a
great deal worse than marry the War
wick heir. .In fact, most of the Ameri
can heiresses who in recent years have
married titles have done a great deal
worse â at least as regards the sample
of husband that went along with the
hereditary dignities. Lord Brooke Is
far from being the typical sprig of the
nobility who seeks in matrimony an.
escape from the difficulties of making
both ends meet. He has good looks,
lots >of brains and an abundance _ of
pluck and energy. He will never be
content to play the role of a mere titled
idler.^&H&flfep
There Is no telling how far he may go.
He went -out to the front during the
South African war . and remained until
the fighting was over. Something over a
year ago he Joined Kuropatkin's army In
Manchuria as a war correspondent, and
did excellent service there,. When he re
turned . a little while ago he -.was sum
moned to Buckingham Palace to tell the
King all about it.
The Earl of Warwick counts only as
Lady Warwick's husband, and it is from
his 'mother that Lord Brooke inherits the
qualities which may some day confer dis
tinction, on the title that la .coming to
him!" . Lady Warwick's beauty alone
would have made her famous, but it con
stitutes tho least part of her claim to
distinction. \u25a0 She has been a Poor Law
Guardian and Mayoress of Warwick; she
has run a milinery shop in Bond street,
founded a home for crippled children,
started an agricultural college for wom
en, written the life of Joseph Arch, and
has now turned socialist. She has never
tried to make money, for herself out of
her enterprises. Her Bond-street shop.
which attracted so much attention, was
started to find employment for the vil
lage girls around her old home at East
on. Her fads are nearly all philanthropic.
They have cost her a mint of money.
Owing -to the agricultural depression that
prevails all over England her estates
have greatly depreciated in value of late
years. There are half a dozen good rea
sons why an American heiress- would be
regarded as a welcome addition to tho
family. Lady Warwick. . from all ac
counts, would make an admirable moth
er-in-law. And the Earl doesn't matter.

A WEO-KNWX INTERPRETER OF .WAGNER WHO IS VISITING FROM
THE EAST. A CHIC LITTLE DEBUTANTE OF THE COMING WINTER AND
A POPULAR YOUNG MATRON ON A VISIT FROM PORTO RICO.
A great, rumpusâ a teapot tempestâ haj
been raised because a few well-intention
ed but hysterical unmarried ladles. have
banded together in Gotham for the pur
pose of saying things about divorce, and
of giving the f rappe glance to such of
their sets as found they had made nup
tial errors and corrected them through
the lawâ righteously.
That's assuredly something the virtu
ous ladies ' had a right toâ to band to
gether for a definite fight against divorce
as a principle.
But when, like most zealots, they per
mit their zeal to swamp their Judgment,
and set out to boycott socially women
who have been forced to avail them
selves of the law. they place themselves
among the Pharisees.
That the "Daughters of the Faith"â
whoa nobody seems to be taking- very
seriously out here in the Westâ may do
good work through moral education,
there Is no ddiibt. But about that ostra
cism, that's another story. '
â¢ Ethical discussions among the masses
always bear fruit. In this way these
opponents of the divorce laws will help
mightilyâ lf they will but confine their
efforts to a spreading of the light, by
lmp'artlng an Intelligent understanding of
marriage among the young folk now
entering the activities of life. .
This is a legitimate work for any.hu
mÂ»n zealotâ which would, â¢no doubt,' In
clude the Daughters of the Faith. ' â¢:
But when It comes" to snubbing a
friend, cutting adrift from a loved rpla-r
tlve, or abandoning an associate, because
fhe saw- fit to terminate legally an ob
noxious union and thought it right to
do co, the zealous Daughters will put
their footâ or Is It feet?â in It. ; For tit
â¢won't work, and it will be the breeder
of bitterness, and the engendering of a
spirit hardly compatible with the atti
tude of a Christianâ which is "Judge
not."
' Besides, what possible influence could
an ordinary . body of women wield in
the social relations of a big city? ,
Who would be affected thereby? .
Assuredly the boycotterts themselves
for there are but . few families in the
smart set (even as in every other set in
urban social life) where the divorce law
has not been made -available, and thus
does the personal element enter Into It.
A pretty mlx-up would occur if such
a boycott were attempted in San . Fran
cisco. As a matter of fact, I think the
/â¢boycotted" setting . up an . organization
of their own would * have far ! the better
of it in the matter of looks, manner,
\u25a0wealth, find even cultivation- Just look
over the H*t of divorcees In your set,
and think what it would look like with
out them. ..*

: The. Parker- Whitheys, who have been
passing the cummer at their country
home in the south of Maine, and where
they have been entertaining the Joseph
Eastlands, felt quite at home during the
earthquakes last weekâ it seemed vj

of the Puritan East, but the Californians
didn't seem to mind it.
The- engagement of â¢ Ethel Barrymore
to Harry Graham, late of the S--ots
Guards and former private secretary to
Lord Rosebery, is a bit of interesting
news to the Burlingame folk and many
townspeople, who have always had a
predilection for the Barrymoresâ and
Miss Ethel in particular.
\u25a0'A remarkable phase of the little
actress' career is her phenomenal social
success in London, where she met "the
young â¢ officer who has coaxed. ,\ "yea"
from her pretty lips. If. is likewise true
that the was received by the "ins" . on
this side of the waterâ but that is'hard
ly so remarkable, as the little mummer
lit always a great drawing card, put in

other story. There society women are
not so kindly disposed toward favorites
of the stage, for their chic and com

suyDAYTTTTTTTT ..T7. â¢â¢â¢â¢ â¢ r. ~â¢ â¢ â¢ JULY 23 ' 1905
A CUPID CLEARING-HOUSE.
THE slaughter of men and women, of all ages, because of unre
quited or too much requited affections and of no affections at
all, goes on at a lively rate. One gentleman from Poland who
was content to trot in the conjugal harness as long as he lived at
Lodz or Warsaw, coming to this country found that his wife am
not look good to him any more, and cut her head off, separating
her from what few looks "she had. Another approached the Gates
Ajar by the opium path, because some modern Barbara Allen dis
favored him.
A large number of men have recently butchered the women
who rejected them, and as many women have found solace in car
bolic acid because their trousered deities were cold unto them. We
notice that under such circumstances women, as a rule, refrain from
killing the indifferent man. but terminate themselves instead. Man,
however, usually kills the woman first and then blows out his al
leged brains, or 'sends his alleged soul hence in some other way. $
As an impartial observer we prefer the way of the ladies. God
bless 'cm. They kill only themselves, thinking that the hard-hearted
cause of it will" feel badly, which he doesn't. Then there is a con
siderable number of imitators of Marie . Bashkirtseff, who killed
herself for the love of no one in particular, but just because the
Prince did not come into her life on a white horse and lay his
feathered hat at her feet.
So we have the everlasting tangle. Too much passion here;
none, there, and a lot misdirected yonder. If they did not insist on
shooting, turning on the gas, jumping into deep water, or, worst of
ail, on drinking deeply of nasty carbolic acid, the busy, brawling
world would not hear* of their "afflictions of the heart which make
them conspicuous.
There is yet another class of soft-pated young men, who go
troubadouring under the casements of ladies like Miss Gould, and
write them letters, all green and gushy, and wind up in jail as
the reward of their fervor.
What shall be done with these folk who get morbid and abnor
mal through the mismatching or no matching at all capers of their
alleged hearts. They are not pleasant company, even when they
don't shoot and are dangerous when they do. No doubt a percent
age of them achieve their heart's desire and in due time the girl
who made eyes and wanted to die for him, hales him into the di
vorce court "and tells how he walloped her with a skillet, knocked
her teeth out and .refused to buy victuals for their offspring. On
the other side .the chap who neglected his work to pursue his divin
ity or die, and caught her, goes to the Judge with a tale of cold
suppers and none at all, of hearth unswept and house unkept, and
pot unboiled, and wonders under oath how he ever was such an
infernal fool.
What seems to be needed is a sort of Cupid's clearing-house,
where those with a surplus of the divine passion can part with it,
and those with a deficit can equalize their condition. With the
steam pressure brought down to an average the passion would not
call for so many guns, for carbolic acid and other destructive agents,
and the divorce courts would. not have to gaze on such ghastly
ruins of romance as now engage their attention and set the clergy
solemnizing the obsequies of society on account of the divorce evil.
Perhaps the erotic literature of the time causes it. Or does it
cause the erotic literature? It is often difficult to differentiate cause
from effect, and this seems to be one of the cases. Perhaps if the
book writers would throw a little of the cold water of common
sense on these hot hearts of ours, the bath would do them a lot of
good. While waiting for this, watch the papers and note the next
victim of an attack of undying affection, and the ensuing call for
the Coroner.
OUR ELECTRICAL ADVANTAGES.
MAGIC in the sense of supernatural performance is probably
in no way so closely approximated by the wonders of reality
as in the uses man has made of electricity. Nowhere on
earth is this wonder of actuality so surpassingly like to.some imag
ined magic done by wizard power as it is in California. The Cali
fornia Promotion Committee has made a convincing statement of
some of the leading facts that show forth this unique advantage in
the Electric Power number of its July "For California."
It is. of course, a common sense, business-like representation of
the State's resources: but it is impossible to read the condensed
enumeration of the plain facts without feeling all the charm of ro
mance arising from these reminders of what marvels have been
accomplished so close around us. The precept that from the known
we must learn to develop the unknown seems specially glittering
with promise as applied to this still half mysterious resource.
â¢The magic of our situation is in our proximity to the Sierras
and the high hills that are steps up to them. A little, feeble appear
ing stream, high up in the hills, has an immense potential force de
rived simply from its lofty situation. Directed downward through
an inch pipe it gains the rigidity of a bar of finest steel and thrusts
with the force and speed of a mile a minute. The pressure of it is
equal to 850 pounds to the square inch. Some of these little streams
have a capacity of more than 5000 horsepower â enough to run an
ocean going vessel. Transformed into electric energy this force can
be carried hundreds' of miles away and used either concentrated or
in minutest economical subdivision.
The marvel of the energy is not fully revealed even by that
statement, for the water, after doing that work, is down in the val
ley's levels still more valuable than is water anywhere else in the
world. Sometimes, indeed, the energy generated by the descent
of the water goes on down through conveying wires to irrigation
plants and lifts that same water up again to spread upon gardens
and orchards.
A feature of this issue of the magazine is the showing it makes
of the possibilities of electric power for the farmer's uses. % In Kane
County, 111., it has been demonstrated what electric motors can do
in land cultivation and in various kinds of farm work, Jeven to the
elimination of much of the vexation of the little inevitable "chores.''
In brief, an electric motor costs $500, and at an expense for a year
of about $40 it will do as much work as a man and team which
cost $960. That would be a desirable gain in all kinds of farm opera
tions, but any one who is familiar with orchard work will see that
the advantage of having a motor in place of putting a bulky, un
wieldy and not always well trained team of horses among valuable
trees is something that the estimate of money saved does 1 not fully
express.
Another feature of note is the reminder of the divisibility of
this power which California has so richly among ifs resources. The
minute, economical and convenient divisibility of electric power en
courages the small manufacturer to undertake a multiplicity of en

PREVENTION OF INSANITY.
T NCIPIENT insanity is a subject which is being given special at-
I tention at the new Psychiatrical Clinic at './Munich; Germany
* has twenty-two of these clinics, but the one at Munich- is the
best, and the* United States Consul General at Berlin^ is authority
for the statement that in the perfection of equipment* and in the
scientific enlightenment of the methods employed it stands at the
head of all, institutions of its class in the world.
Increasing insanity is said to be one of the penalties of our, rapid
progress in civilization. Under the strain of business and social

YOUNG NEWSPAPER WOMAN BECOMES
SOCIAL SECRETARY TO THE WIFE
OF VICE PRESIDENT FAIRBANKS
ONK of the most -important women
in Washington to r day is Miss
Margaret Wade, who has recently
bet.n appointed social secretary to
Mrs. Fairbanks/wife of the Vice Presi-
To those unfamiliar with social life at
the national capitalâ and every year
Washington \u25a0is growing more and>more
to be the social center and inspiration
of the countryâ such an announcement
may seem strange, says the Philadelphia
North American.
One, however, has only to bear in mind
the fact that ofliciaj fasnionable functions
in Washington have of late years as
sumed much of the nature of court life at
Old World capitals, and, to that extent,
Washington society is officially "The So
ciety" of the country. r-' , k . '
For that reason, largely, many wealthy
people of the United States are building
palatial homes at the national capital,
with the hope of getting admission intc
the official Four Hundred.
The fact that the diplomatic corps'con
tains many titled Europeans, and that
the general social and diplomatic stand-
Ing of the corps has been gradually rising
of late years, through the evolution of
young Ministers to Embassadorial rank,
and the enlargement of their embassies,
together with the desire, . born not so
many years ago, of leading diplomats of
the world to serve at Washington, has
tended to Increase the importance of the
capital's official society.
In this, naturally, the wife of the Vice
President, next to the wife of the Presi
dent, is the. leader. , â¢ - . ,'
These two women are arbiters, in a
large degree, of the social fate of aspir
ing Washlngtonlans, and of people from
other-parts of the country, who seek en
tree Into "court life." ->.
Mrs. Fairbanks is expected to entertain
considerably during the term of her hus
band. It is of. vast importance, therefore,
that social aspirants have their* names
upon her list, not only for the privilege
and pleasure of attending the . functions
given by her, but because the stamp of
her approval is necessary as a qualifica
tion to the ranks of official fashion.
f But once in. a generation has the Vice
Presidency afforded to its occupant's wife
the full privileges and social powers that
attend the exalted position. For that rea
son alone Mrs. Fairbanks has an excep
tional opportunity before her.
Many Washingtonians still remember
with pleasure the quiet elegance of Mrs.
Levi P. Morton's entertainments and the
charming atmosphere of the Morton
home.
For the short time during which she
was the second lady of the land. Mrs.
Garret A. Hobart worthily met all the
traditions and responsibilities that cen
tered about her position, but Vice Presl-'
dent Hobart's career, was cut short by
death.
Mrs. Roosevelt was wife of a Vice
President only about six months, and
during the season of the year when so
cial festivities are usually relaxed. Vice
President Stevenson was not an elabor
ate entertainer. Mr. Hendricks, like Mr.
Hobart, died in office. Vice President Ar^
thur was a widower, but had there been
a Mrs. Arthur her social reign as a wife
of the second highest official would have
REMEMBER THIS HERO
W-HEN we're speaking of heroes and trying to frame \u25a0
A list to inscribe in the temple of fame, \u25a0 -
Let's pause for a moment and join in a song
For the hero obscure who is lost in the throng.
Perhaps r neath a bushel his lamp struggles dim:
Yet the world puts a lot of dependence on him '
Who faces his duty, still, scorning to shirkâ
The man who says nothing, but just goes to work.
HIS courage. is not of the sort that may win
Applause and reward in the battle's fierce din ;
His hardship is one that full many would shun,
For it's farewell to friends, when, there's work to be done.
It's farewell ; to 1 sunshine and farewell to song,
The way of endeavor is lonely and long.
Men must honor, though fools niay dismiss with a smirk.
The man who says nothing, but just goes to work.

complications, the hurry and urgency not merely to grasp life's
prizes, but to avoid its actual calamities of ruin and poverty, minds
break down in an ever growing percentage. A function of this great
institution at Munich, built at a cost of half -a million dollars, is the
prompt application of every known resource of detection and pre
vention of those mental v ailments which are the\ accompaniment of
modern overwrought life. It takes timely charge of that important
class of patients who are on the border line of alienation. It saves
a considerable proportion of these and restores them to lives of
usefulness and happiness. Allowed to pass on the, downward side
of that border line, these would become a menace to themselves and
others and a burden to the state. ; . .
It is to this feature of insanity treatment that we most need
the application of all the resources of science. To provide the
guarding of the dangerous, and the reasonable comforts and decen
cies in which the incurably insane can live out the" balance of their
ruined lives, is comparatively a simple problem of business -and
philanthropy; but to call back to" sanity a mind that is wandering
away into madness is an art of almost limitless possibilities, and re
quires not only the highest technical attainment of tHe student : of
alienation, but combined with it, an exaltation of personality in, the
practictioner beyond that needed in physical surgery and 'medicming
the body. He that would minister to a mind diseased must know
more than how to give pills and when to provide: warm baths and
prescribe diets.
To the young student of ' medicine there is perhaps no specialty
of the physician's; art which would more 'appeal to; the XwishVfoiva
highly ambitious career than that of the alienist: It is a profession
that to be truly great in would require first the training- in concen
tration and continuity ; to master what is technical; 'and then beyond
that the noblest all-round mental and moral developmentâ the graces
of infinite patience arid persistence combined with sympathy, the

Roosevelt's experience.
Upon: Miss Wade, therefore, as social
secretary to Mrs. Fairbanks, will de-
volve important duties that are almost
withftut precedent within the memory of
the present generation. \u25a0 :
In the first place, she must pass upon
the eligibility of every aspirant to posi-
tion upon Mrs. Fairbanks* visiting list,
because the wife of the Vice President
will leave almost everything to her judg-
ment.
Miss Wade must, and does, thoroughly
understand all the intricate questions of
procedure and precedent. She knows who
should be invited to various functions,
how guests should be seated at table,
and all the other niceties of "court life."
for, after all, even in republican America,
official life at Washington is'largely a
replica of that at European courts.
This important and busy young lady
is a native of Pennsylvania, having been
born at Elizabethtown, in the northern
part cf Lancaster County,
Ten years ago she.went to Washington
and experienced splendid training for her
present position as social editor of a lead-
Jng capital newspaper for several years.
She has also traveled extensively abroad,
and is well acquainted with social eti
quette in foreign countries,
It is understood that Miss Wade has
literary aspirations, and hopes In time
to be able to devote herself to writing
fiction. . -
She is also intensely Interested In the
study of social economy, which accounts
for her having been one of the few
women Jurors in that division at the
Louisiana Purchase Exposition, where
she served as secretary of the group
dealing with the betterment of working
women, of which the only other woman
juror was the Countess of Aberdeen.

RUB PEOPLE RIGHT WAY
AND YOU WILL SUCCEED
G. R. CLARKE
OF the forty-nine articles of suc
cess, not rubbing people the
wrong way should be put any
where among the first three.
"Tact is better than smartness: take
on civility and a certain dignity, and
with hard work you are bound to win,"
is the aphorism" in which a great rail
road president has summed up his ad
vicr-to younjr intn.
One of the greatest factors in the suc
cess \u25a0of Herbert -H. Vreeland has been
his affability and general good humor.
He was fortunate enough to be born with
a sanguine temperament ; and genial,
j cheery good nature. â¢ "He has smiled,
and toiled, and succeeded." is the way
one of his biographers has put it. and it
was owing to his obligingness and popu
larity and to the fact that he was in
capable of taking umbrage: that was due
one of the turning points in his career.
It was in the early days of his work
on the New York and Northern that he
made a mistake of some technical char
acter that resulted in his discharge. He
was so far from being daunted at this
mishap that he returned and applied for
a position in the same company in a
less important place.
"VBEELAND KNOWS. ASK Hill."
He not only got back his old position,
but was so obliging about doing other
men's work . that he was * considered al
most a soft mark. One day the New
York' capitalists who owned the road
decided tipon a tour of inspection. There
was a great brushing and cleaning up and
putting in shape of details on the road
after the time of their arrival was tele
graphed.. The visit was made suddenly,
however, and there was a great deal of
information that the division superin
tendents felt that it would be well to
possess which they did not have time to
equip themselves with. The intricate
facts of railroading are not easily
crammed.
Question after question was fired at the
men who were conducting, the party of
Inspection. The matter was invariably
referred to one of the young men In the
background, "oh, '-Vreeland knows; ask
hlm.'\ They asked about tracks, stations,
rolling stock, and to everything the pleas
ant-faced and raw-boned youth seemed
to have an easy and pleasant as well as
an â¢ intelligent answer.
"Who is he?" asked Mr. Whitney.
"He Is a "orakeman. station man. con
ductor, or any old thing." was the an
swer. Later, when he was summoned
by Mr. Whitney to go to New York, the
directions were to find the "pleasant-faced
and pleasant-mannered young man" who
had answered the questions of the party
on Its recent trip.
RESULTS FROM COURTESY.
In all his business positions Mr. Vree
land is genial. He is as affable in his
dealings with the. men under him as he
Is with his superiors. From the first he
has Interested himself In the affairs of
all his men. He knows every man who
has been on the road.for a year or longer
and he encourages them to talk with him.
To this plan has been attributed the
wonderful results of his reorganization
of the Metropolitan road. Few employes
are either dissatisfied or discharged, and
it is Mr. Vreeland' s own statement that
he has seldom had a complaint. Yet each
one knows that he can see him and that
he will be cordially received. They have
learned that he is a last resort, but if
they have not received satisfaction after
taking their complaints through the
proper channels Mr. Vreeland desires and
invites the presence of any one in his
service.
There Is seldom, so specific a callâ with
a - large salary attachedâ for tact - and
good nature as there has been in the
case of Chauncey M. Depew. There are
few men who have won success in life as
he has. He has been successful in many
more ways than one. He Is a Senator
from the greatest State in the Union
and he is a man of wealth, and most of
his success has \u25a0 been due to one thing â
his good nature. Many great corpora
tions' have need of a popular, kindly man
to act as a buffer between them and *the
public, and of all holding such positions
Depew is the -ideal. He is also one of the
best paid. He has a perfect control of
his temper, a wonderful faculty of rub
bing off the rough edges, and has done
a great deal of good in positions in
which a less tactful* man might have
done harm.
TOM WALSH'S KINDNESS.
There is probably no one of all the
successful men of the present who have
throughout exercised more of this qual
ity than Thomas R. Walsh. The treat
ment which he gave to men in the old
Leadville days, often to men without a
cent, excelled if anything In kindness and
cordiality that with which he met people
who are better off. His treatment of the
men under him and his preparations for
their comfort, his thoughtfulness of
their needs, was first considered . an ex
ample in philanthropy, but has since
been regarded as a working principle in
labor economics. That a strike is-un
known among his men is not only the
boast ,< of Mr. Walsh, but to ' it and the
fact~"fhat he has had. the best work out
of them that was possible he attributes
much of his rapid success.

CHOATE KIXDEST OF MEN.
Joseph H. Choatc. in making a million
dollars out cf the law. has fount 1 , his
strongest aid In the kindlincs3 which he
has exercised toward others. A latÂ«
biographer has described his amiability
as of a kind that awakens friendliness In
turn and begets trust for trust.
In spite of his reputation for sarcasm
there is not a more kindly man. in the
world than Mr. Choate. His Innate kind
ness of heart was displayed in the tri
bute which he paid to Roscoe Conkling
when Conkling appeared against him in
the Pacific Railroad case. It was just
after Conkling's bitter defeat in tÃ?^
United States Senate. Choate said:
"However we may differ, we owe the
Senator one debt of gratitude for stand
ing always Incorruptible In the halls of
corruption. Shadrach, lleshach and
Abednego won immortal glory for pass
ing one day In the burning, fiery fur
nace; but he has been twenty years
there and has come out without the
smell of smoke upon his garments."
It was a gracious speech, and Conkling
remembered it gratefully to his dying
day.
TREATS ALL. CASES ALIKE.
Of himself Mr. Choate has said: "I
have made it a rule never to neglect a
case, no matter how unimportant it may
seem. A doctor owes it to the dignity
of his profession to treat a cut finger
successfully just as he Would a frac
tured skull. The same thing 13 true of
the lawyer, though, unfortunately, all at
torneys do not appreciate thl3 fact."
It is due to this devotion to the inter
ests of even the humblest clients that Mr.
Choate has won a greater percentage of
the cases he has appeared in than any
other lawyer known. Hl3 unfailing cour
tesy of manner has *been as helpful in
demanding his rights as It baa In ob
taining for him his popularity. On
one occasion, when he was addressing a
bench on which Judge' Van Brunt was
sitting, the Judge turned his chair
around and began talking to one of his
associates. This habit, not unusual on
the bench. Is an annoyance to lawyers
which It Is often part of their policy to ,
ignore. When Van Brunt, surprised at|
the hush in the courtroom, looked around^
Mr. Choate said: "Your honor. I have
just t twenty minutes In which to make
my arguments. I shall need every sec
ond of the time and also the undivided
attention of the court."
"And you shall have it," replied the
Judge, instantly acknowledging the jus
tice of tha appeal.
FRAXCIS' PLEASING JLWA'ER.
David R. Francis, a "self-made man."
has alway3 been of singularly pleasing
address. In the success with which he
has handled his numerous administrative
positions in Missouri, and in the re
markable way in which he directed lbÂ«Â»
fortunes of the Louisiana Purchase Ex
positon. which depended upon
him more than on anything
else for its success. have Sn-en
due largely to his tact, his srcÂ»t
gift of handling men, and to his popular
ity and pleasing manner. Especially did
this urbanity make an impression during
his famous European" trip which saved
his caused This was only a small part,
however, which his popularity has played
jin hfs success.
When he was a small boy in the river
house in St.- Louis the pleasing manners
of "Davy" Francis were responsible for
more than one promotion. Later, when
as a poor young man. he won one of the
wealthiest and most accomplished girls
of St. Louis for his bride, his popularity
again helped him to break down all op
position. It has helped him to every po
sition to which he has risen, and It has
made of him an idol among those with
whom he has lived and who have been
the recipients of his cordiality.

Much of this same quality Is shown at

casion from some nationality or class of
people who by special temperament and
training are able to furnish us the super
lative model for the mood that should go
with the varying times and occasions of
which life is made up. Now when Paris
ians go out of doors to enjoy themselves
and realize holidays, they are the model
merry-makers furnished by the gods for
all the rest of the world to pattern by.
Though we may refuse or fall to imitate
tncra in other things, here they call to
us imperiously, and it is right we should
obey and follow laughingly their lead to
care-iree states of mind, and places
where nature loves specially to locate
these states.
On* reason for this !s that the Parisians
s:e temperamentally gay. We always
knew this;, but we know it more after we
have read this book. So it tends to get us
Into the right mood of gayety with which
. to stert out upon our holidays by read
ing about these gayest of all gay peoples.
Vo say '"reading about" is to use a feeble
expr^tficn In telling of how the style of
th;e author transports you to Paris and
minglig you with the throng who have
gore outdoors to deliberately abandon
tbetn*e!vei to the spirit of happiness. We
a.:e thown another imitation-worthy
trait of this French crowd In that they
know so well that an essential part of
*eif happiness is to avoid spoiling the
happiness of others. So it is a courteous
crowd the book mixes us with, and in all
thÂ«- fun there is nothing ill-natured. An
other note which we should mentally
carefully make whilst we are being
guided through this care-free crowd that
fills the parks and pleasure grounds is
the evolution beyond vandalism to which
the Parisians have attained. Hoodlum-
Ism in that sense has vanished from the
city, and it seems as little likely that the
race would revert to it as that it would
revert to cannibalism, beauty and
glory of Paris is recogniSd by the popu
lace as belonging to them, and the rough
est and humblest urchin on the street
feels himself really part owner in the
flowers and trees and statues, and any
trespass against them will be instantly
hooted down.
The Introduction to the volume ushers
you Into the imagination of the glory of
La. Belle France, and then swiftly en
lightens you about the out-of-door loving
nature of the inhabitants of this beauti
ful land. The author says that to them
life In the open air means nine-tenths of
the Joy of IH-ing. Then he tells you how
their minds are "ever alert to subtle
humor, to the beautiful and the ro
mantic. You do not have to explain
things to a Frenchman; his intuition is
his sixth sense." He enjoys that which
is purely pastoral and that which vi
brates with gayety. He can rough it;
end ho has learned democracy and
good-fellowship.
Then he tells you of some Parisian Sun
days. You may go to the Fete dcs
Fleurs as gorgeously or as economically
as you choose. You can get a chair for
a few sous for all the afternoom along
the Avenue den Acacias, in the Bois de
Boulogne, and see all Paris there in g-iy
mood when the air is laden with the
fragrance of trees In full blossom; hear
the crowd cheer, and see the battle of
flowers begun. You can catch chance
fragments of the merry and harmless
flirtation* of little modistes with bold
dragoons, who, because under stern dis
cipline, have to take their teasing stiffly
but good-naturedly. You can see what is
called the march of the Mldlnettes, that's
of the young working girls thronging out
to lunch. Monsieur Auguste coined the
word: he made it out of midi, midday,
and dinette, half a dinner. The gay and
pretty girls do not worry that the dinner
is only half a one; the Mldinette gets a
little wine, a little sunshine, and she sees
her sweetheart. Sometimes these Mldl
nettf-s have a go-as-you-please race to
music, and sometimes they have an "all
hands round" : as a sign of camaraderie.
He tells you fondly of the Theatre de la
Verdure, built â¬0 years ago by_ the Em
press Josephine: "A symphony orchestra
of sixty was hidden in the leafy glen,
find at 4 o'clock a blast of trumpets and
a solemn roll of drums brought the com
pany bf the Odeon upon the stage. The
birds sang merrily during that scene, of
lov*Â» and Jealousy, and the music of the
ArWlenne welled up from the hidden
glen."
Some stirring pag*>s are given to the ac
count of gay Paris of all degrees, out to
enjoy the excitement of the gTeat race for
the Grand Prix. It is run for 300,000
francs. The crowd holds its breath and
strains its eyes.
"Hurrah ! Brentonvllle in the lead ! The
multitude is screaming. Belle Chance,
with delicate muscles of steel, leaps
closer and closer to the leading mare.
ThÂ« Jockey in yellow blouse riding her Is
poised as lightly In his stirrups over the
email saddle as If he rode In air.
"Hurrah! Belle Chan* is in the lead.
Rob Roy and Babette are fighting for
place. .
"Belle Chance! Belle Chance! shriek
half the multitude. She is like wet
bronze in the sun and "she leaps nearer
and nearer to victory. Brentonvllle with
a tremendous effort presses closer and
closer to her shining flanks. :
"On!? sobs Mademoiselle. Oh! Her
breath is coming in little gasps. A signal
from the Judges' stand shoots up. Bren
tonville has won the Grand Prix."
There is a word picture of high tide at
Trouville where gay Paris bathes. Per
haps the thing he tells us about, that
which will stay most picturesquely in. the
memory, is of a sort of lady of mystery
who habitually sat there in the shadow
of a bath-house.' Evidently wealthy and
amidst all that display of varied fashion,
she always wore the same gown. The
pink of neatness, but always in that gray
gown, and about her shapely neck a col
lar of pearls worth a hundred thousand
francs. Every morning she watches the
bathers, ever in the gray gown "and
wearing the gleaming white fortune about
her neck." Wouldn't It be a pretty ro
mance if the secret of that was because
it was thus in pearls and gray that some
lost one who had loved her long ago loved
best to see her dre.ssed*, always being able
to idealize her most highly when he hap
pened to see her so?
In the chapter "With the Parisians in
Normandy" the reader will find some
pretty pages about "a most adorable lit
tle Countess, as dainty as a Dresden fig
ure, and chic and magnetic to that in
describable point of finesse and refinement
that is second nature to the smart Paris
lenne." Then there* s> a good account of
"Bohemians at large^'; about the painters
in the forest of Fontainebleu; about St.
Cloud, and a description of a chateau.
The volume ends with guiding us through
Monte Carlo, and telling us of that pe
culiar miniature country of . Monaco,
where the natives pay no taxes and talk
in Monegasque.
Altogether the book is an excellent one
for holiday times. It will persuade city
people to go outdoors to hunt for innocent
gayety. The woods and their tuneful deni
zens will do them good and make them
Parisianly gay. They will see the fields
and sympathize with the toilers in them,
and get as bronze as they. Out there they
may themselves reap a good harvestâ of
health, of renewed energies, enthusiasm,
and of the little inspirations to do those
things which best help to make the charm
of all life; above all, peradventure they
may harvest an enduring friendship, bom
of happy summer moods, heaven-given
and garnered safe forever. \u25a0 .

AN EXCITING STORY
.OF PLOT AND MURDER
Imagination being given, the bare
outline of events upon which is built
the novel called "Millions of Mischief,"
a recent product of Headon Hill's, can
readily see how much might be made
of it when a good story-teller chooses
to enlarge upon the few main . fact*.
To fancy one's self in the shoes of the
principal character, Arthur Rlvington.
is a certain way to get into the excite
ment of the peculiar, situation; or, if
one happens to be a lady, to imagina
tively be Janet Chilmark, who was
Rlvlngton's love, would be to receive
many fictitious sympathetic thrills for
a lover in a long suspense of peril.
The book carries you rapidly forward
with the rush of arriving events. There
is little time taken up with any words
beyond the tilling of what happened.
It is one of that class of books which
appeal to those moods when we want
Just a story for the story's cake. Just
a thirst for a story straight and no
mixture. Essays, sermons, comments,
philosophizing, moralizing and - all that
genus we may be: sated; with for the
time, and so for an hour we want the
story only. Just for a change and a
rest, and if we know we need more
than thatâ then let It come to-morrow.
The tale begins with a stormy meet
ing of the British Cabinet. The Pre
mier, Lord Alphington, breaks it up
imperiously because his .will was re
sisted. His eagle glance singles out
three dissentients. These three re
main after the other members have
followed their, chief out of the>room.
The trio, for reasons that seem good to
their ambition, plot' the death of the
Premier. A subservient tool must ..be
found to do the murder.. ; One of the
plotters, Northmoor, the : Horqe Secre
tary, thinks he has a\ man so com
pletely at his mercy that his obedience
can bo depended upon.even,to do, such
a deed. ' It is a young man; under, senf.
tence of death for the murder of "his
mother and sister," but the Home Secre
tary has the privilege <of securing him
a pardon. The plotters- arrange to let
this man, Rivlngton, out of Jail,' pro
vided he. will agree to kill the .Pre?
mier. Another' tool is : necessary/: to
watch !<! < Rivington while ,he is ? at : large
and force him to his work,- under, pen
alty of rearrest and . return ; to Jail and
to the gallows ; if he " falls. The . man
chosen for, this position of manager, to;
the ' murderer ; is . Herzog/ of Uhe secret
service, a detective v of .* remarkable
skill. Herzbg is in a the; power, of Sir,
Gideon ; Ma rske, Chancellor ,'of, the r Ex?:
chequer, : another, of i the j plotters,' '\u25a0 and

gone, wrong. His- guilty/ secret was

kept by the Chancellor, and under
threat of its betrayal: llerzog was com
pelled to be an accomplice. So in a
roundabout, secret way, herzog and
Rlvington got their orders to attend to
the death of the Prime Minister, but
the source of the command was cleverly
concealed. Rlvington was only to un
derstand that the instructions are from
such high authority as could save his
neck. . . \
The Interest Is , intensified' from the
fact that Rivington is innocent of the
crime for which ho is condemned. The
only person in the world who believes
he is guiltless is the woman he loves,
Janet Chllmark. Thus we have the pe
culiar temptation of a young man and
lover, under the terror of . a close at
hand and disgraceful death, to free
himself and'go to live with the woman
he loved if he would consent to shift
death from himself to the man who was
at the head of the Government respon
sible for this undeserved condemnation.
The condemned man. is given just two
weeks in which to accomplish the act
which will result in his freedom. He
accepts his freedom and promises to
kill the Premier. \u25a0
Rivlngton has to play a very deep
game to deceive Herzog, because his
secret intention is not to murder Lord
Alphlngton, but to use the. two: weeks
of freedom in a desperate attempt to
secure the evidence which would prove
him innocent of the crime of. which he
was convicted.- On his way to the resi
dence of the Premier he gets a chance
to rescue from drowning Lady.Muriel,
the daughter of Lord Alphington. She
happens to have formed a friendship
with Janet Chllmark. Lady Muriel's
gratitude opens the doors of her
father's house to Rivlngton, and thus
chance makes his opportunity to easily
manage the death by poison. 'At'the
supper table Rivlngton ; pretends to put
poison, which, had been furnished him
by Herzog, into the wine the Premier
was to drink. He has replaced the con
tents of the little bulb syringe the de
tective gave him with water and so
hopes to gain time for his main scheme
by leading Herzog to think he is will
ing to kill;the Premier. A great aston
ishment comes to Rivlngton. when Her
zog shows no anger nor surprise that
the supposed poison cup does no In-
Jury. Then comes thvgreat puzzle of
Herzog's actions V and character, .which
is never, cmopletely cleared up. : He, of
course, may also have a double game to
play, for one of the plotters Is making
a. slave of him. r . it develops that this
Sir , Gideon Marske is a relative of the
real ' murderer, ' for whose crime Riv
ington is falsely condemned. \ ,'' : . . 1
The story has the peculiarity of be
ing-told;; partly by, Rivlngton himself
and partly* by, Janet' Chllmark. "The
two. lovers have a most stirring two
weeks-while they struggle with all
their '/wits to save Rivlngton; from the
gallows. - ;

CALIFORNIAN AUTHOR
WRITES NEW HISTORY
gj William C. Doub, the ex-Superintend
ent of Schools for Kern County, Cali
fornia. .- and author of several, educa
tional books, has written "A History
of the United States." . designed for the
purpose of /\u25a0 teaching by the topical
method.': Ifis so written' as to com
blne^the teaching of history with that
of civics, so that a separate book on
civics Is not only unnecessary, but un
desirable. " Dr. George Elliott Howard
says of such â¢ a method of teaching:
"Lists of dates and genealogical tables
of I royal, or noble personabes are not
sphelpfulto the youth preparing him
self for citizenship . as a knowledge of
the institutions 'of his country <and
State, or even of his county and village
or school district." 'The five great In
stitutions, namely, government,* Indus
trial life, social life, church and school;
are given prominence in arranging the
scheme of the work. The author writes
from the point of view that government
is ': the of the experience -of
society into law, and history is the rec
ord , of that experience. The history
has been in course of preparation for
six years.
It is claimed for this volume that in
itthe history of the United States is
divided into. Its natural periods, and
the discussion of every topic is con
tinuous, and complete. No part of this
method still remains an [ experiment.
During the' past six years the topics
and "Questions in' this book have been
carefully developed and worked out in
California.
Every subject i 3 handled with great
brevity. When the author reaches the
period |of the Civil War he Is remark
ably fair in his treatment of both sides
of. the great struggle. Its tendency
upon youth would certainly be to allay
sectional prejudice and dislike.
An item culled from this concise top
ical; method of teaching history Is of
a fact not- often J known" nor generally
remembered, namely, that we -are, in
debted ito the Turks for the discovery
pr America. If the Turks had not
been^ so 'unspeakable Columbus per
haps'had not been stimulated to his
great enterprise. The commerce of
Europe with. lndia by the latter .part
of the 'fifteenth century had grown
very jgreat. The : unscrupulous greed
of. the Turk was equally great, and he
waa in ja* position to cut | off the j cara-^
vans : which carried that commerce. He
did >o and murdered - those in charge.
Therefore It became necessary for Co
lumbus to ; discover anew trade route
to India. Seeking Jt, he .Incidentally
discovered ; America. Columbus is
never for a moment forgotten^ but the
amount i of; stimulus- there 'was in the
enterprising wickedness of the Turks
is seldom remembered. ' ..'

SECRET OF SUCCESS
FOR ONE SMALL DIME
In this week's batch of books is a tiny
one of twenty-two pages, and priced at
only- ten cents. It is called "A Philosophy
of Success." That sounds like an oppor
tunity for a man in misfortune to climb
out by staking his last dime on a recipe
that will tell him how to do it. The thing
originally was an address delivered be
fore the Colicge of Progress in New York
by Henry A. Wise Wdvd. Now it's a
booklet wherein it is shown that in all
things = reason Is the road to success. In
it . there j are some things, which while
they may be called truisms, are yet so
tersely put, and whose iteration is so
excusable because of our perpetual need
of "line upon line, and precept upon pre
cept," that the address may do good by
thus being sown broadcast. Here are
some of his sentences: "What la.lt makes
a, man great? â¢ â¢ Mental Independence,
Mental Honesty, Mental Courage, Men
tal Strength, Mental Skill. Mental Indus
try. â¢'â¢ Do not assume things; find
them out.- * â¢ Do not let the egotism of
your opinions get you into" conflict with
the laws .of - nature. . â¢ â¢ After Mental
Honesty comes Mental Courage. Do. not
fear, to believe what your thought and
reason dictate. *.* If you are with the
multitude do not feel sat~e from the fact.
â¢ â¢ There is more strength on a very
small fact than in a very large crowd.
"If an ugly fact confront you, do not
dodge; do the only possible thingâ reason
upon itS Look it in the face and size it
up; not fearfully, timidly; but courage
ously, firmly. When you have done that,
act quickly, surely, manfully; but never
sneak off to avoid the conflict, for then
you are less of a man than you were
before; and. worst of all, you yourself
will know it. " Those who dislike reason,
fear facts; those who -fear facts hate
truth: these, usually, are the failures In
life."

"Should the novelist seek for the big
things in life?" he was asked.
"I should not advise any writer to hunt
for the big thing exclusively." was the
reply.. "If the blgr subject does not come
to him. he Is not likely to find It. Little
subjects grow wonderfully sometimes:
besides, life rarely behaves as fiction
does, except in the best fiction, like Tol
stoy's, for Instance. I think the serious
novel of the future will give thÂ© writer's
vision of what life Is. rather than what
it ought to be or what It might be."

"Uncertainties of Usage," cheerfully con

Byron. Moore. Sterne. Pope. Irving and
others to show their varied use of tho
words and phrases "the two first" or "thÂ«
first two," "sitting" and "sitting." "lay"
and "He." and so forth. When Sterne's
"Sentimental Journey" was published, an
angry reviewer took him to task for. tha
sentence "But Maria lays in my bosom."

William Dean Howells was talking
about memory and he expressed his won
der over that of the suave persons who
receive the hats of guests at the en
trance of big hotel dining-rooms and
never fail to return them to the proper
owners.
."I do not think* such fsats are an In
dication of Intelligence." remarked his
companion. "It Is merely a peculiar
gift. I do not think those men are very
bright as a rule."
"Oh, I don't know." observed the
novelist; "I remember once asking &
man who returned me , my hat from
among -a hundred or more, how he knew
the hat handed me was mine."
" 'I don't know, sir,' he replied.

In writing to a ! London periodical cor-,
rectlng a misinterpretation of his motive
In writing "The Tyranny of the Dark,"
recently published by the Harpers, Ham
lin Garland stated his position as fol
lows:
"I have no "vehement contempt* for
psychological research: on the contrary.
I , believe It to be the duty of scientific
menâ that is to say, man who prids
themselves on their method, penetra
tion, and calance-rto take up the study
of these most puzzling phenomena. 1
worked patiently, and. so far as pos
sible, without passion or prejudice, as
a member of the executive board of ths
American Psychical Society In Boston
some years ago. and I learned a grtat
many rules of the gameâ one of which !Â».
Don't- rush and don't assume to
know It all."
That the children of the rich are de
nied opportunities for proper development
is one of the conclusions reached by Miss
Martha S. Bensley in the final article of
her series, "Experiences of a Nursery
Governess," in the August Everybody;*,
\u25a0"I "feel Justified In saying," observes
Miss Bensley. "that the reason , for this
condition Is that a large proportion of
the children in well-to-do homes are not
wanted. Motherhood is not instinctive
with all .women, nor fatherhood with all
men. To become a .successful mother re
quires as specialized v. development as to
become an elÂ«ctrlclan or an artist : Any
fairly healthy, adult female can produca
young, but that Is a very different mat
ter from" becoming a mother: , and any
sort of Industrial change that Increases
women's opportunities of . self-support
and so tends to eliminate thÂ« unfit from
maternity. Is to be * welcomed, not ' de
plored."

\\ .-.iiir.srton Crop Bulletin.
The report of G. N. Salisbury, section direc
tor, I'nlit-d Htau-s Weather Bureau, for the
Washington Croj< Bulletin, week ended July
IS. is as b&tows:
Th# wt-ek was much cooler than the pre
ced'ne on;, and tho latter part was showery,
esiwcially :n the western cuunties.
\u25a0j"he :orrj..arl of the wek was fine for hay
in*,, but the remainder of the week was poor,
considerable hay was damag--d and some com
plrtely FjKjiled.
Ihe wcataer was favorable for crops in
gt-nt-ral. Tastures continue good. The rains
benefited Uf? oat.<. potatoes and garden v<^je
lablrs. Corn is growing rapidly and promises
to be a tuod crop. The latp cherry crop is
better than tht early ones Was, but some
ha-v -e cracked from the effect ' of rain. Plums,
pt-ach^s a:Â«d a;irieotg arr ripening. Lice have
*l'!>oar<:d en hops, but they are sprayed well.
Tfcpre are rt-ports that an insect, called by
torce the "army worm," and by othsrs a
cut worm, is doing damage In some locall
lift. It is thought that iril* may be the
cutwerm. is doing damage in some locajl
that created sucli a havoc with vegetation In
th*- Pugct Sound country in July, 1000.
The hot spell. of the preceding week came
opportnneb- to a close- on the 10th. before *oy
conÂ»iÂ«!i-ral>lo amount of injury had bten done
train. The greater i^art of the wheat crop
is 111 the BOtum stage, and thÂ« weather of the
pan \v<c\i couIJ hardly have been better for
wheat filling. Kust. however. Is increasing in
\u25a0-\u25a0me localities. Winter wheat and barley are
rii>ening ra'>iJ!v and cutting has brg\in in
cume MODtbeca districts. Winter whfat cutting
mill be gtr.cral in another weÂ«k. The outlook
cunilr.ues vtry tavcrable fcr a heavy crop of
wheat, oatt anJ barley.
Dried Fruits In XÂ«r York.
Late mail advlcc-s from New York say:
privatsr letters from a number of sources
recÂ»ivÂ«i here at the end of last week all give
the came trtory of serious damage to fruit
crops in Santa Clara Valley by excessive heat.
So much have Prunes suffered from this cause,
tcccrding to report, that tstimates of the crop
have btt-n reduced by at least 10.000.000
pounds, and some contend that it will not now
exceed 7o,<>oo,oo<> pounds for the tntlre State.
Buyers here seem disposed to accept these
rnx>rts with some reserve, past experience
leading them to believe that sellers on the
coast are disjw.eS to exaggerate the serious
ness of the situation. However, samples of
PruntF takes from trees in Santa Clara Val
ley during the time of fiercest heat show
the fruit to be shriveled and burned on the
side Jieareii tr.c sun. Holders on the coast
are very firm in their views, and. while an
occasions! transaction in 40s to 60s Santa
Ciara stock for October shipment was .put
thicuÃh at the end of last week on a 2*ic
f . c. b. cjast bap basis, the market at tne
close was practically on a 3c f. o. b. big
basis for Santa Clara and 2? t c f. o. b. basis
for cjtslde fruit. In fact, aTI varieties of
dried Irults arc very strongly held on the
coast. Peaches hÂ£.v c an upward tendency and
Apricots a>e expected In some quarters to
ftdVmncC a>s the t-'anta C!ara crop is claimed
to have bÂ«?en cut down at least 25 p*r cent by
the same caustf that are affecting Prunes. In
ttie local market on Saturday the most promi
nent feature was the buoyant market lor Cur
rants. While no definite information was
added >o that received on the previous day,
it seems to be a foregone conclusion that the
nicnopoly measure trill pass the Gieek Cham
ber of Deputies. Acting upon this assumption.
shii.j.ers have raised prices to 12s Â«id@l.is on
old cro}> foi prompt and lSsglSs <5d for new
for September rfcipment. Spot prices are tend
ing upward and at the close it was doubtful
if less than 4? t c would be accepted for line
uncleaned in barrels by any holder."

\u25a0Reports' from 'the' Prune districts say; that
the crop. - already light.' has been still further
cut down" by the recent hot spell/ and this en
hances the firmness \u25a0. in ; this fruit, quotations
for : which continue \u25a0to point upward. There
is some -excitement in Peaches owing chiefly
to* the heavy, purchases, of the. fresh fruit by
the canners, and' prices are higher." The Apri
cot; crop is : also reported > damased ' by the . re
cent \u25a0 hot : weather. . Evaporated?. Apples rule
very firm in \u25a0 sympathy \u25a0 with the Eastern mar
kets." which are very. strong owing to the un
usually  poor outlook \ for the Apple crop  this
year. In . fact, whenever  this king . \u25a0of all
fruits  the Apple has a short crop everything
in the fruit line goes. up. and it is this short
age in 'Apples- this year as much as anything
which. is, advancing the dried fruit markets of

DArGHTER-IN-LAW OF KINÂ«
OSCAR ASV QCEEX SOPHIE OF
PWEHEN.
Â£;ct!&l Cable to The Call.
LOKDOX. July 22. â It is said that the
recent marrlogre of Princess Margraret
of Oocnau^bt to Prince Gustavus of
Sweden was one of those rare excep
tions â a royal love match. Perhaps so,
but thtre Is no such proof of it as iras
furnished by the marriage of another
Swedish Prince in England seventeen
years: ag-o and under very different clr
cumEtanoes. Just because that was
nothing but a love match. entirely of
Cupid's making, no ceremonious fuss
was made over ' H and the European
sovereigns all held aloof from it and
did not even send any wedding present*
to the bride and bridegroom. The ro

that, having just become possessed of
the latest photograph of the heroine, I
have thought it worth while to recall
Its main incident* . .".,v^-; r
Prince Oscar Carl Auguste, Duke of
Gotland, second son of the King and
Queen of Sweden, was 25 years old
when he fell In love with his mother's
prettiest and favorite maid, of honor.
Miss Ebba de Mtinck. She was a scion
of one of the oldest and most distin

claim to have mote blue blood- in her
veins than th.c descendant of the man
whom Bonaparte had placed on the
throne of Sweden. Prince Oscar told
his father as much, but that did not
soften the King's opposition. He in
sisted that his handsome son should
wed only within the charmed circle of
royalty and be content with the pick
of' tome half-doren petty Princesses.
The oourse cf true love did not run
Fmooth for many a long day. Miss
Mur.ck herself refused to listen to the
Prince's suit and absolutely forbade
him to make any sacrifice for her sake,:
She resigned her court appointment
and when she found that her royal
lover was bent on following her to her
father's house she left home and ' en-

Son of Oscar Now
Living Quietly
in England./
Renounces Title to
Wed Woman of>
* His Choice.
tcred a hospital to train as a nur3e. â¢
But Osrar would not give her up.
Rather would he lay aside. all th> t'tks
and . prlviliges that his royal birth con
ferred upon him. In. his despair he turn
ed to his mother for comfort and aid.
Qu?en Sophie, herself a Princess of Nas
sau, had her own prejudices to : conquer
but she was greatly attached to her fa
vorite maid-of-honor, and still more
dearly, of course. \u25a0 did she love her son.
He convinced her that he could nevjr be
happy as the husband of. arty 'other \vom
an. The mother In her triumphed over
the Queen. She saught out the hospital
nurse and pleaded her son's causeâ with
success. To win the King's consent was
a more difficult task. Finally, when she
was about to undergo a serious operation
which she might not sufVlve.' she Induced
him to yield to what .sSc- urged might
be the last request aho would ever make
of him. And : wh;n -she had recovered
from the oparatlon fhe came over to
Bournemouth- and herself gave away the
bride. There were none other of Prince
Opcar'c relatives present.
In a rose-covered house on the South
Coast the happy couple have lived since
that day, occasionally visiting their na
tive land, but making England their real
ttome. Their boys go to English schools
and they live the quiet life of English
country gentlefolk. Of course when he
married the Prince renounced his royal
rights and all prospects of succeeding to
the throne. The King granted him the
title of Prince Bernadotte; and the" Duke
of Luxembourg, head of Queen Sophies
family, more recently created him Count
of Wlsborg. but it Is little he cares for
such dignities. He has never regretted
cutting adrift from the throne, and
Princess Bernadotte has long been satis
fled that,. It was no sacrifice after all he
made to marry her. The Norwegians
would be glad to have him as their new
monarch, but he has no desire to assume
the responsibilities of a crowned head.
Perhaps If he were offered the presidency
of a Norwegian republic he might accept.
Of stalwart figure, tall almost as his
father, with clear, earnest eyes and a
noble bearing, he would attract attention
anywhere and in no company would he
appear to greater advantage than In one
composed of .the scions of. royalty. s The
Princess has lest much of the beauty
that first won his admiration, but . she
has gained the crown which only rests on
the brows of happy wives and mothers,
and his devotion to her is as fervid as
He did not attend the royal wedding of
his nephew, nor did his wife. His
younger brother. Prince Eugene, was
there, but as soon as the grand function
was over, he lost no time in making his
way to the /rose-clad house. Prince
Eugene is stiU a bachelor. It is said he
has declared that a bachelor he will re

other;- woman like she who .. was Mjss

nobly during the hours following the
disaster.
At Agnew Sanitarium, where a large
majorfty of the victims have been
treated, there are etill 34 sufferers, al
most a dozen of .whom are expected to
die of their terrible Injuries. Too much
praise cannot be given this institution.
Dr. Gochanauer iind its corps of able
physicians. Dr. FopteÂ»r. who is in di
rect charge of all the. injured, does not
hesitato to speak in tfie highest praise
of their untiling efforts to relieve the
suffering seamen.
IVOSBJtf AHE HEROIXES. ..
He does not fail to mention the 1 wo
men of San D!c-gx-. who have volunteer
ed to the number of sevtral hundred,
and who brought .linen, medicine* und
every article which their thought
fulness and good judgment dictated in
the pressent emergency. Twenty of
these volunteer nurses were taktn In
and they rendered noble and efficient
service. At St. Joseph's Sanitarium, a
quiet, peaceful appearing, retreat far up
on the hill, ten of the scorched and
scalded sufferers are resting easy. Sev
eral of them are horribly injured, but
the eifitcr superior in charge believes
aJI will recover, though some will be
crippled and maimed for life.
Close to tht water front, In the old
army barracks, nine other victims are
loked after by Dr. Kneedler of the
army mediral corps at Fort Rosecrans.
The majority of these nine are- very
badly scalded and may die. It was to
this place that Ensign Perry was taken
Tfhcn brought arhore, and from this
place his drnd body was removed only a.
few hours later.

pany. The Marconi System has a practical monopply of the wireless business on the Atlantic. The news is
received every day throughout the trip, not only from the various Marconi S Stations "in both ,' England and
America, but also from other steamers up to a distance of 3200 miles: vOn'the American' Line;^ the OCEAN
DAILY is called "The Trans- Atlantic American"; on the Red Star Line "The Red Star] News,'! etc.; etc. - / fO.
By means of the new Marconi magnetic detector and transmitter over one hundred; words a minute can
be flashed, which is three or four times the speed of the ordinary telegraph or cable, while the cost per word
Is less than half the cable-rate. \ ' <\u25a0'\u25a0. '\u25a0' i -^
By contract with the Western Union and- Postal Telegraph Companies Marconi messages for passengers
at sea can now be sent from any of their 50,000 offices in;the United I States and Canada. ;;; \u25a0

"LONDON. July 22.-â To -Vice Consul
C. U. AlUn, San Diego: PJease arrange
for a euiiable wrealu to bÂ« sent on the
occasion of the funnrul of the victims -of
the accident to the United States steam
ship Bennlr.gton. with aineere sympathy
of the British navy and Admiralty-."
Chief Engineer WadÂ« of the.Benning
ton doe? not believe that-great, damage
has been done the hull of the Benning
ton. "The water cume in very gradu
ally," said he, "and for that reason I do.
not think extensive damage has : been
done the BfCtlon of. the hull now below
the water line." He could not offer an
opinion as to when the ship would be
pumped out, further than to call atten
tion: to . the- immensV pipes now being
put down into the hold for dmwiuK off
the water. - , . . y . â¢â¢ ;
. At 7 o'clock tornigjit, hews comes
from the Behnlngton -that rapid pro
gress is being ni:'.de in pumping the
water from the lire room. It had been
lowered sufficiently to permit a re
sumption of the work of rescuing the
imprisoned bodies. It ia possible these,
may be recovered during the night. ,
After working- all day to lower the
wuter in the hold of the Bennin&tnn. the
e!j?ht-!r.ch centrifugal â¢ pump on one of
the Syreckels barges lowered the water
in the central compartment so that the
men were able to go to work. Two bodies
wore recovered, which the suction ; drew
to the surface about IX o'clock last night.
One of the bodies was headless. It Is
\u25bauppcFcd to.be"that of an oiler named
De Courtney. The ; qther ia '' that . of

Divers Are Sent From Mare Island to
Search for Bodies of Victims
Special Ulspnteh to The Call.
VAT.T.F.JO. July 22.â That the explosion
Â«X the boilers on the United States steam
ehip Bcnnington was due to the ineffl
ciency of the engineering department of
the ship is the opinion wnich is fast gain
ing creder.ee among naval officers at the
Mare Island Navy -yard. One of the beet
known officers on the yard told The Call
correspondent this afternoon that there
was no warrant machinist aboard the
Bennir.gton. and that the officer under
whose supervision the ship's engines and
boilers had been placed never had a day's
experience in the engine room, and the
exact condition of the boilers was never
at aj>v time known to him.
The Bennington was at Mare island for
repairs early In May last, but nothing
was done upon her boilers, although that
they were not in the best possible condi
tion was long known to the men in the
engine room.
The explosion will be thoroughly inves
tigated, but it is not believed here that
the exact cause of the disaster will ever
be known.
The distiller RhirÂ» Irish, with her alien
captain and Chinese crew, left the navy
yard this afternoon for San Diego. On
board she had two complete divine out
fits, and on the owl train from Vallejo
Junction to-nicht were sent two divers^
and Ensign Stanley Woods of the navy
tug Fortune, which went south to tow
the "Wyoming 1 north. The Fortune Is now
at San Diego and Wood goes there to as
eume command of her. The divers will
attempt to recover the bodies of a num
ber of the crew who are believed to be
pinned down in the wreckage below
decks, and also to ascertain If the Ben
nington is worth bringing to Mare Island
to be repaired.
Captain Franklin Drake, captain of the
Mare Island Navy-yard, Iras arrived at
Ban Diego and assumed command of the
Bennlngton. and will look after the Gov
ernment's interests. Captain Underwood,
head of the ordnance department, is tem
porarily in charge of the navy-yard.

MRS. IT.RKY PROSTRATF.D.
SAN. DIEGO. July 22.â 0n the train ar
riving from the north to-<iay was Mrs.
Perry, the wife of Ensign Newman K.
Perry, who died at the army .barracks
yesterday afternoon as the result. of his
Injuries. Immediately after the death
of Ensign Perry a telegram was sent
Mrs. Perry by Surgeon Peck informing
her of her great loss. This telegram, was
not received by Mrs. Perry and she left
San Francisco In j ignorance of the true
condition of affairs.
When she arrived in San Diego this
noon she had not learned of the death
of her husband and Immediately, asked
Lieutenant Yates, who was present, how
seriously injured Ensign Perry was and
how he was getting along. Lieutenant
Yates called a carriage and took Mrs.
Perry to the Hotel Robinson. On the
way up he broke the news to her. Mrs.
Perry collapsed completely and when she
arrived at the hotel was in a hysterical
condition.
Major and Mrs. R. H. Rolfe were wait
ing at the hotel for. her and Mrs. Rolfe
did everything possible to comfort the
widow In her great bereavement. The ar
rival of Mrs. Perry on the noon train was
something of a surprise as it was not
expected that she would reach the city
until this eveninr.

CAPITAIN OF SH I P SAYS
BOILER WAS LEAKING
Mechanic on Way to Repair It Whep
the Explosion Occurred, He
Officially Reports;
-.WASHINGTON, July, 22.â The details
of ' the explosion on the United States
gunboat Bennlngton :at San Diego, as
ascertained by Commander Lucien Young,
were recelveÂ«l at the Navy, Department
at 11:15 o'clock to-night, in a long tele
gram from the "commander. : It appears
from the telegram that a small leak had
been . discovered :in boiler I B and the
boilermaker was on his way. to ? repair it
and was passing through the engine-,
room when the explosion occurred. The
dispatch follows:
. "SAN DIEGO. July 22.â 1 have employed
stevedores and laborers from shore, and
am making every effort to stop leaks
and to recover dead still under wreckage
and boilers. I believe principal leak is at
bottom below the pipe and the leak un
der rudder head. . ;
"Many seams are shaken loose and
leaking. The ship at high - tide is | filled
with water two feet above the main deck
on the lower side. Another engine was
employed last night to pump out water,
but was. unsuccessful.;- -I -am- now.; rigging
a big centrifugal pump. . I \u25a0 hope I will
be able to pump out the water.
"I am of the opinion that the cause
of the accident, as far , as I can ascer
tain, was a small leak" in : boiler B. \The
boilermaker was on his^-way to repair" it,
and was passing through , the engine
room when the accident occurred. Boiler
B was forced to the stern through its
bulkhead and came in contact. with' boiler
D, which was also forced through its
bulkhead, and both boilers explodedwith
two close -explosions. ; â¢ â¢ â¢
"There was np noise; only a thick thud,'
which filled the ship from stem to stern
full of scalding ste.am, soot I and ashes,
even so much so that the main deck was
uninhabitable and those that were not
blown overboard Jumped overboard for,
air, and in my opinion many of these
were drowVied; for I still. have seventeen
missing that cannot.be' accounted for.
"The men are quartered at San Diego
barracks, where they are very comfort
able, t retaining a guard and a relief
guard on board. The wounded -are scat
tered around in the three hospitals and
those, but slightly wounded in private
residences." Dr. . Foster, Marine Hospital
Service, has charge of a force of efficient
doctors, who are doing all In their power
for the wounded. Dr.- Kneedler. . army
resident physician, has a few at , San
Diego -barracks and is doing all in his
power for them. : . ._ ~ ~ '.
"I have made arrangements for the
burial of the dead with military honors
in the military cemetery at Fort Rose
crans to-morrow afternoon. / Captain Scott
and officers of the fort are "doing, every
thing oossible and he will furnish a fir
ing squad to-morrow. I have engaged an
Episcopal minister and Catholic priest to
read service over the dead."
DRAKE IS IN CHARGE.
Captain Organizes Boards to Make an
. ' _ .. Inventlcntlon. â¢
SAN DIEGO, July 22.-Captain Drake,
the .captain of the yard at Mare Island
navy yard, arrived on the noon train ac
companied by Passed Assistant Surgeon
Charles J. Smith, who has charge of
the Mare Island Marine Hospital.- They
were accompanied by four hospital stew
ards who have taken" charge of the . in-:
jured at the barracks, under the direction
of k Surgeon Smith. Captain Drake, who
has authority from the Secretary of the
Navy to take charge of all matters, stat
ed that he had ; come expecting, to find
things In mucu worse condition than they
are. He had come, he said, to : care for
the - injured and he had found them al-_
ready cared for In a manner that was
highly satisfactory. He took occasion to
compliment the work of San Diego people,
particularly the physicians who had put
In their time so generously 'aid contln
ously. , < . ; ,
"We have found but little to do in ..~at
department," he said, "save take up the
work that has so well been carried along
and assisted when we can. On board
there is much to do, but worn is progress
ing as fast as It possibly can and seem
ingly under competent direction.
"I am not yet ready to say much about
what I have found, for I have just com
pleted: the work of organizing certain
boards : to : direct the ! investigation and I
have not 'yet received their reports. I do
not expect them for some time, possibly
for several days." .

lieved he '. was dead. 'I had such a
frightful dream last night,' Mrs. Kuntz
told me, 'It was all confused and' yet , I
could. see something all so plain. There
was a great crowd and all was con
fusion." V. Suddenly there was some mu
sic, and the crowd appeared to change,
and all was ; gay. There came Charles
with a ' beautiful girl leaning on. his
arm. The orchestra was playing the
wedding- march. -Then it appeared that
I was of the party. I. was a brides
maid and took part in the strange pro
cession. It seemed all so .strange. I
realized that . I was my -boy's, mother
and yet here I was acting as a brides
maid at his wedding. While I was pon
dering on this there was a great noise
and all; was darkness and confusion.
â¢ "'The gayly dressed people all disap
peared and the. music was succeeded by
hideous noises. The light appeared to
return 'slowly, and It seemed that I
was on the shore of some ocean. There
were bodies floating on the crest of the
waves. Then there was a great stream
of light and It centered' on one par
ticular body. " I glanced and the light
fell full oh the face. It was Charley
and I saw that- he was dead. His eyes
were closed and his face was. covered
with the pallor of death. I grave a

* : LO^T?ON, July 22.â For thÂ« first tlmÂ©
in the. history. of British- xallroadlaaf a
safety appliance has been adopted by
some of the most* "lmportant railway
systems -without compulsion. A 1A 1 block
signal system has just been successful
ly Inaugurated upon eleven, miles of.
the. main, line of- the Northeastern RalP*
way Company after many exhaustive
testa and -Inspections under the super
vision of % * the Board of Trade. I am
told-. that Â«'. final order Is to be placed
covering all thft of this, com
pany In tha near future- The 'extent
of this contract In valuation amounts
to ?i;00&;000. -The contract goes, to an
American concern, the Hall Sisnal Com
pany, which gets the credit of making
tne' first' satisfactory* Installation' of"
any block signal system. ln the Utoited
Kingdom. ., l, v?as to?d,to T day that- the
Chatham and Dover and the lldndon
and Southeastern railways have ;fcoth
decided? to adopt the. American stand
ard of signaling. and are at present In
vestigating: the merits' qt the appli
ances oif the Union Switch and Signal
Company and the- Hall company, j These
railway companies are abont^ to^send
experts to the United States to inspect
the -practical workings of the signal
feature of American railway operation.
Upon their return the British railways
Interested ;are to place -their orders.
" Lieutenant Colonel P. G. yon Dbnop,
R; " D."; representing the British : Board
of Trade, has only Issued provisional
permits to use .the American signaling
system, up to tha. present time.. He. has.
however, now decided . that they may
safely be used In Great Britain. 'where
the conditions differ, so largely "from
those of the United" States. fact, the
Board of Trade has In contemplation a
plan to introduce a provision into ita
regular* bill" before Parllanient- to" th? j
effect that the American system eiA
block slgrnallns'. be exclusively ;useit
upon British railways. Tt 13/ claimed
uo.!<rthef; country has produced a [sim
ilar system which Â«o nearly. meets the
EncrHsh* requirements. ' " Colonel : yon
Don op .^states, that the utmost Impor
tance rr.iiy be attached to- the fact that
the railways are- taking this matter up
roluntJirlly. \ It Is quite clear.l though,
that the Question of , economy Involved
Is more considered than that of thy
safety of llfe.;*;"^

LONDON. July 22.â Although Man
nington^HaU, the Norfolk home' of Lord
Orford and liiÂ« American wife, is one
of the loveliest places in Norfolk, it Is
aootit to bo vacated by the couple, and
a, firm of Loiuion house agents has been
instructed to I'ease it for a number of
years. The reason Is that the former
Mlsh Louise Corbin wants a Scottish
home. She spent a portion of last year
in Scotland and was so delighted with
the "scenery of the Highlands, that; she
ha*" now decided to set v? a. residence
there as coon as a i-onvnlent. place can
be found for her. She and her daiigh
ter.'pretty I^j^y I>orothy W'nlpole. are
devoted" to -tithing, and they nnd t!ie
Scottish rivers particularly well adapt
ed for this sport.
The people in the neighborhood "of
Mannlngton . regret the decision- the
Countess ha* 4 arri\"ed at, because she
has always been most liberal' in minis
tering to the wants of the sick 'and the
poor. Lady Dorothy is also -quite 'as
charitably inclined us her mother, quite
a lot of. her spare cash finding Its. way
into the hospitals arid, nursing homes
in i he neighborhood. It is understood
that Lord Orford has no desire to leave
his Norfolk home. but. when the Count
ess sets her mind on doing. anything
she must be obeyed. It is; likely,; too.
that the town residence will be trans
ferred from Bruton street. - Mayfair, to
a more commodious mansion ;in Cado
gan Gardens. Kensington) once the res
idence of Mrs. Langtry. ./\u25a0,.;/':-:*,,'
That section of London society which
insists on seeing money spent â no mat
ter what- are the circumstances ; of the
spenderâ is quite angry with trie young
Duchess of 'Roxburghe; because she is
entertaining so v little this season.
"Moan" is the exact epithet which ir
responsible spendthrifts are applying to
her." The real truth Is," however. i that
the recenU'rcfurbishing of the Rox
burghe seat. Floors Castle, ate up about
every. spare' penny of the ' Duchess.inc
ome for y this year. "and, being;some
thing of 'a .business woman, rand ;a'
(tensible one besides, she is not disposed
to touch her: capital for the. sake *'of
gratifying ithe parasites of Mayfair."
Moreover, ; the Duke of Roxbur'ghe. who
has ! extremely^old-fashioned iifleas,ude
testa the notion of his wife being a so-
;the3ax fkano^
clety leader." He is a typical Scotsman
In many ways and objects on principle
to seeing:, money.; frittered 'away. ;: ?\
I It is a fact to be lamented, however,
that the (Duchess is. not dressing ; this
year Avlth ; her accustomed taste. Here
tofore she has-been stylishness itself,
but lately she seems to have losticom
pletely her eye for "color. Her bats, too,
have left \much', to be desired. ..All' of
which is leading; her feminine critics to
declare that * the i Duchess may be .- cer-'
tain,": at least, that no one will copy her, 1
which |is one of the few things which
positively annoy her. Grace.. Her orders
to, her ; dressmakers and . are
always emphatic on the point that nbth-*
Ing . of hers ! shall '.; be â¢ repeated. It : is to
be: hoped? that ; th'ei Duchess will . not
lower s her standardjof attire,; for '-sho: is
.a woman x who required to) be' carefully
dressed "; and :in whose case Mt.^ Is more
than^ordlnarlly a matter/ of fine feath
ers making, fine birds.' . ; : -.-. ;.-. . ->
?. To \be ?, regarded as one = of, London's
hostesses; is: one of Uhe'smost" difficult

JUMBO JUNIOR
NOW THE RACE
Pocket-Edition â¢Pachyderm
Appears at All Aristo
cratic Functions in London
APPEARS BEFORE QUEEN
Little Elephant Consumes
$500 Worth of Cake
at the Kessler Dinner
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, July 22.â His now famous ap
pearance at the Kessler dinner was only
an Incident In the social career of Jumbo
Junior, the world's smallest elephant,
now resident in London. Although the
fact didn't get into the papers, the pocket
pachyderm had been a feature of several
fashionable functions before he distin
guished himself by passing the birthday,
cake at the Savoy, and he is at present
"booked" for a dozen or more coming
Mayfair functions. In fact, to put }t
paradoxically, the elephant seems likely
to become even a greater lion than was
the monkey. Consul.
Captured by an American, Charles F.
Mayer, in the wilds of Burmah. this mite
of drab intelligence is but 35 Inches high,
weighs 236 pounds and proudly parades
bis importance at the ripe age of 12
mouths. It cost just J7 60 per pound of ,
hte weight to deliver the little elephant ;
to his English owners.
Jumbo Junior used the Eccentric Club as ;
tbe first rung of the social ladder. Then
he showed his versatility by playing
"Home, Sweet Home" on a mouth organ
at Lady Wernher's children* party at
Balhhouse. -where he presented a minia
ture of himself to the most beautiful ,
young woman presentâ aged 12.
Jumbo Junior's social career reached its
climax recently when he appeared at the
royal garden party given in the grounds
of Buckingham Palace In honor of Prin
efcse Victoria's birthday, and made an in
rtant "mash" on Queen Alexandra. When
coming before the distinguished audience
the elephant followed his trainer as se
dately as usual until he had arrived in
front of the Queen's chair. She presented
fcjra with a lump of sugar, which the so
cial favorite dispatched with such gusto
that the Queen immediately sent for a
plate of c&kes and bananas with which
ehe regaled him still further.
After this the elephant's trainer per
suaded him to return to the from ot
the audience and mount his little tub
preparatory to playing the mouth or
gan,* but just as Jumbo was about to
lit Sin his eye wandered In the direc
tion of the Queen, and in spite of the
efforts of his master, he jumped off
hie tub and walked straight to her,
holding up his trunk Jn expectation of
more gifts. The Queen sent for an
other' plate of cakes and the elephant
remained steadfastly by her side dur
ing the rest of the afternoon.
At the close of the entertainment
Queen Alexandra rose from her seat
and Jumbo Junior trotted proudly l>e
*=ldo her. Then the Puke of Connaught
â the King's brother â joined the Queen
and presented Jumbo with a magnifi
cent Tasmanian apple, which was cut
and peeled for him.
Decidedly refined and patrician In
quality are all the tastes and education
of the new favorite. He goes to meet
his social engagements in a four
wheeled cab, and discriminates nicely
in the matter of food and drink. This
was Illustrated at the Kessler dinner
and Is among the unrecorded events of
that notable affair. The dainty young
elephant scorned everything on the
menu except the birthday cake, which

Forty-Five Tons of Dyna
mite Shatters Hendersons
Point and Clears Channel
J PORTSMOUTH, N. H.. July 22. â Huu-
Idreds of visitors came here to-day to
witness, with the people of this city
I and vicinity, the culmination of an en
j gineering project which has been un
der way for the last three years and
â¢which has attracted the attention of ex
perts both in this country and abroad.
It was the removal of Hendersons Point,
a ledge some three acres in extent, from
the Piscataqua River bed by explosions
simultaneosuly by about 400 charges of
dynamite, aggregating at least forty
five tons, in the rock beneath the water.
The hour, scheduled for the dis
charge of the dynamite was -t p. m.
and at 4:10 the big blast was turned
loose. The explosion was a complete
success. It shattered the mass of rock
and thereby widened and deepened the
waterway leading to the big drydock
j recently completed by the Government
at the United States navy yard on Sea
veys Island. The contract price of the
undertaking was $749,000. The expense
was covered by a. Government appro
priation in connection with the bill au
thorizing the construction of the big
drydock at the navy yard. It is un
derstood that the charge of forty-five
tons of dynamite is the largest ever ex
ploded at one time In this country.
Hendersons Point is a solid ledge of
horseshoe shape. 400 feet wide at the
base and jutting out into the river
about 300 feet. . Around it ifhlrl in
numerable .currents and a tide which
has been the dread of all mariners. .The
swift waters have worn a channel
-ninety feet deep In the solid rock
around the end of the point, but the
force of the cross-currents has been so
great that for years it. has been a
menace, especially to the development
of the navy yard. With the establish
ment of the great drydock its removal
was Imperative. Its destruction will
give an approach 1000 feet wide and of
a depth of water ample for the great
est ships in the. world to^ Portsmouth
and the navy yard.
he was requested to pass to the guests.
As he did so he leisurely consumed
$500 worth of it. leaving the other $100
worth for the guests. He would drink
no Scotch whiskey whatever, but in
sisted on champagne. Altogether his
food and drink cost the host just double
the amount of any individual present.
When It came to distributing the din
ner favors. Jumbo Junior made himself
deservedly eraclous to the women.
Edna May says he gave her *3ust the
diamond ornament she coveted, but no
matter whether the trinket was of dia
monds, rubles or sapphires, each re
cipient declared no better selection
could have been made.

In Swedish water*, lie Is expected to

. LONDON, July 22.â Interest in the Rus
sian situation for the next few .: weeks
will by no means be , confined , to peace
negotiations. It is not improbable that
developments will occur, perhaps within
a few days, which will be of great his
toric importance and -which will alter, the
whole present aspect of events.. It Is
not. possible to forecast what â¢ these de
velopments will be, because great an
tagonistic forces are at work and- no man
can cay what movement or plan will
succeed, or what fall. ...... .j
There are two or three, different policies
represented. For Instance, at the Moscow
conference one of the alms .was to force
the present government to grant reforms,
including, a national legislature and a
constitution, without removing 1 .the pres
ent sovereign. Another party, led by
Prince Yakuskine, scarcely concealed Its
desire \u25a0 and purpose to sweep away the
whole Romanoff dynasty. . /\u25a0 â¢
Again, we are told that the authorities
have discovered a vast" plot which was
expected to culminate to-day, for destroy
ing the Czar and all reactionary leaders.-
The secret police have been able to learn
no details, but partial knowledge so
alarmed the Czar that he determined , to
flee from danger on his yacht. / ,

caused by the incessant fire of telegrams
from Manchuria, not from Commander in

whose titular ' chiefs ;are members of the
royal family, are pouring in ; dispatches
addressed direct toHhe -Czar, imploring
him not to make peace. ..â¢â¢"â¢ '\u25a0
- Their,. effect has been: that, Nicholas re

gaining peace as an affront to .the honor
of -the army and the, country: In fact,
he would prefer to abdicate rather than
make any peace that is possible. : â¢ \u0084
. There is a strong: : party 'among the
Czar'B entourage which favors peace on
any reasonable terms. Vit Is ! led by ; the

"De Wltte has no : detailed instructions

Captain AmÂ« of the Thomson says he
never experienced such rough water.
Waves ran high and broke over the decks
of the dismantled ship and her consort.
The Elihu Thomson, weighted with cargo
and tow, was making little headway, when
suddenly the 4-lnch hawser parted with
a report like that of a arun. ' The helplesaj

DE WITTE IN PARIS
Far Eastern Situation Dis
cussed in Conferences
With Loubet and Rouvier
PARIS, July 22.-M. de Witte, the Rus
sian peace plenipotentiary, had a iv\*o
hours' talk with Premier Rouvier to-day
and was received in audience by Presi
dent Lcubet at the Elysee Palace. No
authoritative statement was given out
concerning the meeting. One .report is
that Rouvier and De Witte.went over the
prospective peace negotiations, dwelling
particularly on the influence France coulti
exert on Great Britain to induce the lat
ter to moderate the Japanese demands.
It is also the accepted view that De
Witte is favorable to a Russo-Japanese
understanding, by which lasting peace In
the Far East would be secured. /Tho pros
pects of this undertaking are regarded
as one of the chief, means by which
Japan may be Induced to abate the
severity of her conditions, particularly
on the question of indemnity. . Tho
French officials speak favorably ,jof euch
an Understanding, the ..conclusion of
whloh, besides benefiting Russia and
Japan, would strengthen France in thÂ«
Far East as the ally of Russia and
Great Britain as the ally of Japan.
-Among De Witte's callers at the hotel
were some of the leading financiers con
nected with "previous Russian loans.
However, De Witte has no need of sound-
Ing financial sentiment, as he has been
completely advised on this subject
through the representative^ of the Rus
sian finance department and by the Paris
branch of the Russo-Chinese Bank, of
which he was one of the chief organizers.
It Is recalled that Rouvier'n ' cautJour
attitude contributed to limit furthe'
French investments in Russian securitiei
When the last Russian loan" was a<
tempted, however, Rouvier's. caution was
not due to any hostility toward Russia,
but solely to hostility to a continuation
of the wan He shares in this respect
the general view of the financiers herÂ»,
one of whom remarked: â¢
"Russia Is able to secure all the French
money she wants to make peace, but not
a centime to make war." \
After his conference with Rouvier and
his visit to Loubet, De- Witte passed the
rest of the afternoon in returning the
visits of personal friends.

Vast System of Electric
Lines Planned for Solano,
Napa and Sonoma Counties
NEW KOAD A SUCCESS
Promoters 3lap Out Exten

in Central Part of State
Special Diepatcfc to The CÂ»M.
VALLEJC, July 22.â That Vallejo
will be the tide water terminal of a
vast system of electric railroads, which
\u25a0will span Solano, Sonoma. Napa and
l*ake counties, seems an assured fact.
The creat success of the Vallejo, Beni
cia and Napa Valley Railroad Com
pany's line between this city and Napa
has encouraged this corporation and
others to plan extensive extensions.
The llrtt to build will be the present
company, which will extend Its line up
through Napa Valley to Calistoga, and
over into Lake County, to furnish a di
rect and cheap route to the rich upper
Xapa Valley and the Lake County re
sorts. J. W. Hartzell, who promoted
the Vallejo, Benicia and Napa Valley
Company, is now worklngr with E. H.
Rollins & Son, the well-known bond
house, to secure the finances to build
alonp the franchises which Hartzell
holds from Vallejo to Suisun, Vaca
vllle and Winters. This road will con
nect with the Vallejo. Benicia and Napa
Valley Company near Napa, and make
connection for Sun Francisco with the
Montlcello Steamship Company In this
city. '; -V
The new line that is being: projected
from Napa to Dillons Beach, through
Napa and Sonoma, counties, is also
6eeklngr closer affiliations with the new
line from Vallejo to Napa.

Modem Business Organiza

A wise man of old said, and it is be
ing repeated by thinking people all over
this country and throughout the civil
ized world to-day, that no benefactor of
the human race brings such substantial
blessings as he who makes two blades
of grass grow where but one grew be
fore. Such a benefactor brings lasting
forms of wealth, not only to the people
with whom he is in immediate contact,
but to the world at large.
As a matter of fact, in these later
days the building of homes has come to
be considered one of the noblest, call
ings in which man can engage.
Men and women In all walks of life
have fully awakened to the fact that
spare money, spare time and spare en
ergy can nnd no channel more promis
ing of beneficial results than that which
leads to the full realization of man's
dearest dream â the dream of a home.
For our ancestors to build a home
was an undertaking which challenged
the grit and courage of the stoutest
hearted, while to-day It is a matter pos
itively simple in comparison.
This desirable condition has resulted
from competition In commercial activi
ties, from trying experiences which
have demonstrated that economy, thrift
and unfaltering perseverance can and
do win in any effort in which they are
jointly directed. It has come through
combinations of business men forming
themselves into what are now known
ft* building and loan associations.
As In the case of all big enterprises
alone the line of human endeavor, the
building and loan association was at
first primitive in character; it attempted
to perform more than its resources
could accomplish. But It found a way.
It minimized expenses of organization
and th<? prosecution of business, it
threw stronger safeguards about in
vestments and finally absolutely elimi
nated every objectionable feature which
earlier essays at the business had
brought to light. The result is that to
day the bettor class of building and
loan associations present to the busi
ness world as safe and perfect a system
of handling investments and making
them an can be devised by man. â¢
The Continental, as is known through
out the commercial community, is. by
many millions of dollars, the largest
Co-operative Savings Society in the
West. Its list of members and deposit
ors would probably outnumber that of
any similar institution in the United
6tatÂ»s. Sixteen years of business has
jgiven the Continental not only a stand
ing of the highest class in the business
community, but an absolutely thorough
understanding of business conditions
from end to end of the Pacific Coast.
Th<*Kc facts speak for themselves. Tr.e
Continental has helped working people
save over $:o.Â«00.000.00. about $2,500.
000.00 of which has been In earned pro
fits, most of it going to people who have
put the money into homes. No other in
stitution in .the West has helped so
many people to get under their own
roof tree as the Continental. The insti
tution is simply a bank, co-operative in
character, distributing to its members
the profits that are earnedâ money de
posited by stockholders being loaned on
first mortgages, nnd first iuortÃnffeÂ»
â¢sly. In loaning the association*
money.' however,- a specialty is made in
advancing loans on homes already built
or hi process of construction. Care Is
taken that' the security, in the land and
the building Is always sufficient to pro
tect the money advanced. Nearly every
city, town and village. in California has
benefited by Its acquaintance with the
Continental Building and Loan Associa
tion of this: city.

LQNDON. Julyi^S.^â For ,> something
like four year*,'; Martin Harvey, has
-been looking for another J'Only Way."
Perhaps it would be too :much to say.
that he has found it in "The; Breed of
the Treshams," but at all events :hls-
American play comes nearer to bÂ«Â»Ag
a. real, elghteeh-karat euccess T: than
anything that the" actqr has tried. since
the public began to get 'tired of seeing
him as "Sidney Carton."
Harvey brought "The Breed of - the
Treshams" back with him when he re
turned from his last American > toiir.'
The author's : name. appears In/the pro r
gramme as John Rutherford; but it has
been rumored that the;piece wasveally
the work of two American women and
Harvey admits that this is the case,.but
'that the- fair authors ;,wish to \u25a0remain
anonymous. "Oddly enough Lewis Wai-,
ler's last success, "His Majesty's Ser-"
yant." was. also the work of two Ameri
can _wdmen and like "The3reed of the
Treshams" was a Roundhead-Cavalier
drama.- ; ;>".' :^\'// :'v > j' -
Play after play has been produeeJ by
Harvey in the hope of striking such
another: success as Freeman. Will's
adaptation of "A Tale of Two .Ci ties."
There was "Don 'Juan's . Last . VVa,3:cr,"
which would notveerve .at all. There
was "The Children of the King" .and
the adaptation of "A Cigarette Maker's
Romance." both of 'which Harvey tried
Jn the United States, but; neither of
which proved a money-maker. . Liko
wise "The Exile" and "Ib and Little
Christina." '. v
London got a chance of seeing "The
Breed of the Treahiams". when disaster
overtook Harvey's j recent production of
"Hamlet" at the Lyric. The actor wÂ«s
late In getfing his Impersonation of the
Dane' onto the boards, and though his
perforriiance was ; : commendable .tho
town was surfeited with the "Hamlets"
of Irving, Benson end Tree. So Harvey
put on tlie . Anierioan-mttde romantio 'â¢
play,' which already has .scored a suc
cess in the provinces.' '
"A niZ.M. '-THRILLER."
â¢ It is a real "thriller" and will please
when it is seen In American, cities. It
is likely to be. next season," for Harvey
has several offers to, cross the Atlantic
again, notably one from Kraw*& Er
lunger. The hero of "The Breed of the
Tresharns" is a Sidney Carton sort of
character, and the. play, gives Harvey
a chance for all sorts of noble sacri
fices. Lieutenant Reresbyâ known as
'.'the Rat" â is a wandering soldier of
fortune. Incident^ly he is the: illegiti
mate son : of Colonel Tresham.' of evil
memory. The "breed of the Treshams"
lies heavy on Reresby.: Moreover his'
rlifc has been .ruined 'by the betrayal of
his sweetheart by: his. own" father. So

Daniel Swett Has
Fierce Battle
'in the Bay.
Uses Boathook as
a Weapon Very
Effectively.
ALAMEDA, July. 22.â While fishing in
a small skiff one mile off the south shore
of Bay Farm Island last night. Daniel
Swett encountered a school of sharks In
the shallow water and fought an exciting
battle for his llfe % with the marine mon
sters. With thrusts from a boathook
Swett kept the savage sharks at bay and
prevented them from capsizing his frail
craft by crowding around and beneath it.
Then he pulled for the shore, which he
reached weak and exhausted from his
thrilling adventure.
Swett Is a large land owner on Bay
Farm Island and enjoys his leisure time
fishing. He left the island yesterday
afternoon on his usual trip and it was
on the return Journey that he rowed
into the midst of the school of sharks
that was evidently pursuing millions of
small fish which Swett observed as he
neared the beach. '
The sharks resented the Intrusion of
the skiff and in their fury lashed the
water Into a foam and rocked Swetfs
little vessel as if It were a paper bag.
Swett declares that he badly Injured sev
eral of the monsters by prodding, them
with the boathook and that the wounded
animals seemed to arouse the others until
the entire school was enraged.
Sharks have often been met with by
fishermen off Bay Farm Island and Swetl
is not the first person who has had a
fight for life in that vicinity. x

OAKLAND, July 22.â Fire, which for a
time threatened to destroy the, entire
block in -which it started, broke out at
11:45 a. m. in the "shoddy room" of the
Wakefleld Manufacturing Company at 463
Fourth street, and before the llames were
checked, the entire building,, which, was
owned by Albert Currlln, was gutted and
completely ruined. An adjacent building
at 465 Fourth street, owneil by E. B.
Thomas, was badly damaged by the
flames, and another building on the
southeastern corner of, Broadway and
Fourth street, owned by James de.Fre
mery, was slightly scprched.
The exact cause of the fire is unknown,
but it is believed to have been started
by an electric "picker" used In the shop
of . the Wakefleld Company. The upper
floor of the building in which the fire
originated was occupied by Mrs. C. Allen
as a rooming-house, and both herself and
the roomers in the house lost all their
belongings.: Almost all the furniture was
also destroyed. \u25a0
Although an alarm was turned in from
box 134, a3 soon as the flre started, the
flames spread with such rapidity that- by.
the time the first engine arrived on the
scene, the entire structure and a number
of outbuildings in the rear were burning
fiercely, and for a time It seemed that
the entire block was doomed. Under the
direction of Chief Ball and Fire Warden
McDonald the fire was attacked on all
sides and the blaze was soon under con
trol. \u25a0 .\u25a0\u25a0â¢â¢\u25a0â¢ . â¢
â¢ All the buildings damaged by the flames
were old structures and fell an easy prey
to the fire, -burning with sucha fierce
heat that at times the .work of the fire
men . was made dangerous.. While at
tacking the fire from the rear Foreman
W. Hartmann of engine No. 2 was
slightly burned on the hands and face,
but no one else was hurt. i r
While Engine Company No. 6 of East
Oakland was on the way to the fire the
hrose drawing the hose carl .was stricken
with paralysis and .fell at the- corner ot
Twelfth and Maddlson streets. The horse
was later killed by a policeman. > l
The total loss caused by the flre will
be about $12,000. The amount of insur

a -few minutes'there were no signs of
life. His body, was removed to the local
Morgue, where Deputy Coroner Streigh

\u25a0Berger was about 40 years old. He
came up from Los Angeles about three
weeks ago* to continue a." campaign he
had started in the 'south in the Inter
ests of the fraternal 'organization he
represented. His headquarters in San

task. He used a bicycle. Berger rode
across Shattuck avenue at the Lorin
station and found himself on the rail
road; tracks -without apparently realiz
ing that a swiftly moving train was
coming from the south.
He did not dismount from his wheel, but
maneuvered about on the track to wait
the passing of the train in front of him
*From the other direction another train
was coming, which Berger completely
overlooked. The engine of this train
struck him- and . sent his body flying,
smashing, his wheel at the same time.
He made no sound, after being picked
up, nor did he give signs of conscious
ness. His family, in Los Angeles was
notified ofthe accident.

for the assistance of the Flre Depart

caustic letter to the Trustees asking
for the return of his money.
In reply the Trustees declined to re
turn the sum Involved on the ground
that the town has no chemical engine
and tl.e Trustees never received any
money with which to buy one. The au

ALAMEDA ADDS
TO HER WEALTH
Roll Shows a Large Advance
in Value of Taxable Prop
erty Over Last Year
OAKLAND.'JuIy 22. â^County Assessor
Henry P. Dalton finished his labors of
compiling the assessment roll ot Ala
meda County* to-day, showing a net
gain in value of J5Â»,253.293 over that
of last year. The total value of prop
erty in the county amounts to $113,
523,700 and to this should be added
some $2,000,000 in franchises on the
branch, roads' of the Southern Pacific
Company, which was' lncluded in last
year's assessment and not In this. The
total amount will be swelled to $115,
523,700 by this. The total value last
year, was $106,240,403, the difference be
tween â¢ these two .amounts indicating
the gain of the county in wealth during
the year. \u25a0 ..
In regard to the assessments, Asses
sor Dalton said to-day: "The Attorney
General has Just handed down an opin
ion to the effect that the branch muds
of the Southern Pacific Company run
ning in Alameda County are properly
parts of the main system and as such
are assessable by the State Board and
not by the County Assessor. This be
ing the case, I did not assess the local
roads running to Alameda, Berkeley
and the Seventh-street line..
"As to the other large corporations,
there. are no great changes. I have
raised the assessment of the Key Route
ferry system and the Oakland Trac
tion Consolidated about .$2,250,000 over
last year. The Key Route has been
much improved since that time and the
traction company has also added ma
terially to its lines.
"The Contra Costa and Spring Valley
water -companies are about the same
as last year, excepting the natural In
crease of the properties, which Is
small. ' .
. "The Realty Syndicate has property
in every section of the city and some
of it has been increased to a consider
able extent, but I do not know whether
it has as much property standing in Its
name this year as it had last year, so
cannot make a comparison."
The value of "the properties In the
cities and townships of the county are
as follows: '
Cities â Alameda. $11,612,525; Berke

when; Police Judge Samuels overruled the
demurrer filed by. Attorney Austin Lewis
In the casVof William McDevltt, charged
with violation of the ordinance prohibit^
Ing, speaking on the streets without a
permit. Attorney Lewis' attacked the
.validity of the : ordinance on the ground
that It conflicts with the constitution of
the'Stateof California, v/hich guarantees
to all the right of free speech on .the
streets as well-as elsewhere.
"In reply to the demurrer the Prosecut
ing Attorney "pointed- out -that .the Su
preme Court has decided that a city may
pass such police regulations as are neces
sary and reasonable, 'and that the ordin
ance, in question - being ; purely a police
regulation, and not even remotely relat

valid: and constitutional. This view was
upheld bj' : Judge ; Samuels and the case
wasTet for Uial by juryon September 26.

propositions on which the Council had
decided to ask that bonds be voted, re
sulted In an exceedingly small vote being

mitted were to purchase a large amount
of water bearing lands In El Cajon Val
ley at cost of $71,000 and to establish a
pumping plant thereon at a cost of $252.
000. Many persons opposed the proposi

enter into a* contract with the Southern

EUROPEAN WOMEN ARE
NOW SMOKING CIGARS
King's Cigarette Maker Says Some Fair
Customers Use Yhre* Hundred
Cubas a Month.'
LONDON. July 22.â -Mrs. TUshigh Hunt
V.'s.llace, who has been lecturing at the
International Congress of Women
Vegetarians, ha* denounced many
things, but none more emphatically
than tbe growing craze for tobacco
eznoklng among women.
When the fashion of smoking first
come Into vague, a tiny cigarette in the
privacy -of the boudoir was all that
\u25a0was permissible. The -first women
cmokers smoked secretly and ashaxned
ly. Since then it has grown from every
now and then a cigarette to many ciga
rettes a day, in all sorts of places. Nor
hs.B it stopped at cigarettes, for lately
many have taken to cigar smoking.
Dainty little cigars, rather larger, in
rlze than a cigarette, and made special
ly for women, have a large sale.
L>oulÂ» Coen of Piccadilly, the King's
cjf arette maker, says that he fold an
enormous quantity of these little cigars
to women. They are made of Havana
tobacco, are manufactured in England
and arc called "Cubas."
"Many women smoke . these cigars,"
he said. "I have about a hundred regu
lar customers on my books, many of
them titled women and leaders of so
ciety, who are regularly, supplied with
cigars. This is. of course, exclusive of
those sold over the counter to chance
customers." *
Some idea of the amount of cigar
sznoklnt: among: women may toe gath
ered from the fact - that as many as
three boxes of cigars, each containing
a hundred, have been sold in a month
to one woman, in addition to nearly a
thousand cigarettes. In 'some of tbe
women's clubs it is as difficult to get
a chair in the smoking:- room as a table
in a tea shop on a matinee day.
f 00,000,000 a Year la Tips.
.PARIS. July 22.â 1t has. been calcu
lated that the amount of tips distribut
ed in I'rance reaches 'the -sum of $90.
000,000 a year. In ' Paris alone it is y cal
culated that waiters, coachmen. 'valets,
concrergres. etc.. divide .'among. ,- them
selves 45C.000 a day, aX the rate of 1M
per cent per inhabitant, while in the
provinces where th<s average tip is cal
culated at. half a cent per, lnhabitant
each day. brings a total of J 75.000,000
a ytar.
Pronounce Serum Worthless.
PARIS. July 22.â Dr. Doyen of cancer
cure fame suffered a terrible blow this
week. 'when the special committee ap
pointed by the Surgical Society to'cx
stnine carefully i.ls cancer serum re

\u0084 NKW YOFK. July 22.â -The sellins
pressure in the stock: market was ag
gravated sharply to-day, sfnd a lar^e
volume of sales came uyon the- market
during: tlic sliort session, resulting In
some wide" declines, .with .the closing
weak and active and near the lowest.
The movement was, attributed to a, cu
mulative effect of growing: uneasiness
over the widespread reports of. dam

which expires next spring,. and the dis
| couiugement of advocates of higher

I favorable reports to stimulate any de
mand for stocks. . The Weakness of the
list. was not local, and tho. list of the
day's losses shows a general distribu
tion in all parts, of the .market.. Union
Pacific showed some unexpected sup
port, and the same was true of Amal
gamated Copper, but these stocks uitl
mately yielded with the rest of 'the
list The weakness in the early. wheat
market failed to rob shareholders .of
stocks, and they, continued to sell, large
selling orders being reported from -the
West. The large loan increase: was the
item of intercsti in the bank statement,
and was attributed to the efforts of
banks holding the proceeds of the., Jap-,
anese loan on" deposit to get them
placed in the money market. The clos
ing was decidedly weak. Total sales
of bonds, par value, 750,000. . .
- The market for .securities was
apathetic this week, and. has borne the
impress of its limitations to . profes
sional operations of the smaller class.
Some part of this is undoubtedly, rft
tributable to the excessive heat, .which
made all degrees of ' human, activities
burdensome, but It is doubtful whether
this would have' prevented thY succes
sion of order 3 in the market with, any
strong motive in force for- buying or
selling. Foreign markets have shared
thti lethargy of our own, and a grow
ing ease In money rates has not availed
to stimulate any absorption of securi
ties. Developments of the week have
been In favor, of, values and confidence
.In the soundness of conditions and in
future improvements has 'been wide
spreads and firmly held, but the atti
tude in the stock market has been one
of waiting : for these conditions to
awaken a demand for securities to take
over the large holdings which had been
brought In the execution of improve
ment in conditions. . The investment
demand growing out of the July, dis
bursements has been disappointing, and
has been especially light for'the usual
investment favorites in which stability
and security are sought, rather than
a large return, -t. '''.-:. ... : . :; J :

SUPREME COURT SECRETARY
IS CONSTRUCTING AIRRSHIP
H. C Finckler Will
View City From
the Zenith.
Will Not Speak of
His Method of
Propulsion.
Oat in the sand hills of Sunset. Henry
C Finckler, for twenty years secretary
of the Supreme Court, is busily engaged
In constructing a machine with which
he hopes to sail through the atmosphere
and skim the milky way. His con
trivance differs radically, he says, from
any airship ever before Invented. He
will take no ,one into his confidence and
If he is successful the profits will be all
his own. I
Finckler has been at work on his air
chariot for the last ten years at odd
times when he could spare an hour or
two from his arduous duties at the Su
preme Court. He expects to put the
finishing touches to his strange vessel
â¢within a comparatively short time and
then view San Francisco from the
zenith. The people who live near his
home at the corner of Ninth avenue
and M streets have become very curi
ous of late about the mysterious aerial
vehicle and eagerly await the day when
they &hall be able to see the genial
secretary go whistling by above the
housetops.
Finckler has always been of a me
chanical turn of mind and those who
know him well believe that his efforts will
meet with some measure of success. He
plans to elevate his craft by means of
gas. but he does not mean to store his
hydrogen in one reservoir. Before and
behind and on each side of the airship
will be placed gas bags, so that if one
reservoir explodes or loses its ef
ficacy the vessel will still be held in
the air to preserve the life of the
atraofherjc tourists.
In all other airships there has been
a propeller, but Finckler says he will
have nothing of this kind in his. The
mttheod of propulsion Is his greatest
secret, he avers. The new , aerial car
will combine the best features of both
eiroplane and dirigible i balloon. Finck
ler asserts he has borrovrednone of the
ideas of Santos Dumont, Professor
Montgomery or Baldwin. He has re
fused several offers of pecuniary assist
ance from people interested In his
work, as he desires to enjoy the fruits
of his prospective victory over, the ele
ments by himself.
Finckler has ample means at his com
mand and will carry on his work as
rapidly as possible. "It may be six
months, it | might possibly be five
years." he says, before the airship-will
be completed. . f-
The Justices and other attaches of
the court are very much interested, as
\u25a0well as the inventor's neighbors, in the
â¢\u25a0Finckler Aerial Flier." â¢ Â£.â¢-*?
JIDGE BBATTV REVOKES
XATtRALIZATIOX PAPERS
ChriFtoffer J. Ol*en. Master of Steam
.: i*b<H>aer, Found to Have Obtained
Them by Misrepresentation.
Judge Beatty of the United States
Circuit Court . yesterday revoked the
naturalization papers issued to Chris
toffer J. Olecn by Judge Morrow in
1897.- Olsen applied for a license as
mate on an ocean passenger vessel and
after it was granted. Investigation
showed that he had Illegally registered
>rs an American citizen by misrepre
senting his age at the time he arrived
in this country.
The license was immediately revoked
and a charge of illegal registration
was lodged against Olsen. It appears
from the record that Olsen stated his
age as 18 when It, was actually "2 and
thus obtained citizenship as a minor.
K. Johnson and C. E. Johnson . were
\u25a0witnesses to the transaction.
Olsen is at present the .master of a
Bteam schooner and resides in East Oak
land. It Is doubtful, however,* if he
\u25a0will be punished, as the statute of limi
tation applies.

Fay Bucke Makes Accusa
tion Against Mrs. Matilda
Christ *to Judge Lawlor
Mrs. Matilda Christ, matron atthe City
Prison; was on the' grill In Judge Law
lcr's chambers yesterday morning in con
nection with the flight of Fay Bucke',
and her' subsequent arrest in Seattle.
Mrs. Christ's conduct will be reported to
the Police Commissioners, so that a
thorough investigation may be made.. "
Fay Bucke was convicted by a jury in
Judge Lawlor's court on a charge of
grand larceny for stealing. $500 worth of
clothes \u25a0 from Rose Decker," keeper jj of \ a
house- on Mason street. She was allowed
to go on probation on March 26 last, Miss
Margaret Fry being appointed probation
ary officer. Mrs.. Christ had taken an;in
terest in the young woman while under
her care' in" prison and ; the Judge i per-.
mitted , the . defendant to live in Mrs.
Christ's home at" 129 Taylor street. Mrs.
Christ promising to give her $10 per
month for helping in. the housework, j
Without asking permission of Miss Fry.
Mrs. 'Christ allowed the â¢ defendant to
work as a waitress "in a bakery on Mar
ket street at $10 per week. After some
weeks the defendant disappeared I and | a
bench warrant was issued for herlarrest.
Mrs. Christ Informed the police and 'the
Judge that, the young, woman had .stolen
Eome: of her.' jewelry and .'underwear. .'-.
When the defendant was brought back
from Seattle, she grave as a reason for her
flight; that Mrs. Christ had proposed that
ehe lead an Immoral . life 'and share.__the
money earned with ' her. :*\u25a0 She ' repeated
this : assertion to , the â¢ Judge . in chambers
yesterday in presence ' of ; Mrs. Christ and
Miss Fry. Mrs.. Christ f emphatically de
nied making :any : stjch proposition.- but
admitted that she had made" a mistake
in charging; the defendant with stealing
her jewelry and underwear, which she
had found, and . had failed to notify ' the
Judge; of the :r: r fact. ; â¢ - . â¢ - \u25a0
The Judge told^Mrs. Christ that he had
to condemn her for, not being frank .with
him and ; telling the ' truth/ She held : a
public. oSce. andlt:was her duty to as-
Bist the - court in ; every;- way .'-.instead '.of
withholding - important,-; information. ; â¢ He,
.would not ., pass "judgment upon/ the v allef.

The \u25a0 Fay '\u25a0\u25a0 Bucket case \u25a0" was ' continued till .
next Saturday, .when . it will . be, heard 'on
its * merits; At; the" defendant's request
she was sent toithe" Branch County; Jail.
;- The' youth t who wrote from Montana; to
the Judge,' claiming* to: be- the defendant's
husband, was in "chambers at f! the ' hear

COLLINS MUST
STAY IN JAIL
Court to Allow Al

His lights Out of Prison
ATTACKS' THE 'TREATY
San Francisco Lawyer Pe
* clares He v AVill fake-His;
Case to the Privy Council
VICTORIA. B. G. July 22. â To-day
George D. Collins, fighting extradition
I for perjury before Judge Lampman, ap
' piled to the Judge at the conclusion
of the sitting for further liberty pend
ing the decision of the court.' He asked
that he be not confined at night In the
(city Jail. Attorney Hlggins. for the
â¢San Francisco police, declined to .tako
the responsibility of" allowing Collins
further liberty, and stated that If Col
. lins was permitted the liberty sought
I the responsibility would be upon the
' Judsre, who declined to accept It* and
Collins will be returned nightly, as
heretofore, to the city jail.
Hfccrins, for the San Francisco au
thorities, said to-day that Collins was
misleading ' th* court because off his
fgrrorance of Canadian laws In holding
that thÂ«?~extradltlon law of ISCS did
not apply. Higgins pointed out that
it did.. and that the later act of 18S9.
amending that of ISB6, had never been
proclaimed. Ha produced a telegram,
to which Collins objected, from his Ot
tawa agents stating they had made a
search of the archives and that the act
of ISS9 had n^ver been proclaimed, arid
therefore Collins could bereturned. HÂ«
quoted cases. Including that of St. John
Dlx. returned from England when
charged' with wrecking 'a bank at Bel
linarham. Wash., to show tnat a fugi
tive'charged .with the commission of
a crime, though not convicted, could be
returned.
Collins renewed his argument that
the extradition act of ISSS. lnr trans
cending â¢ the Ashburton treaty by ln-^
eluding a. provision for extradition for
perjury, which was not -In -the treaty,
was nullified. He claims, that although
perjury was mentioned in the' Paunce
fote-Hay treaty of 1900. the extradition
act of ISS9. which did notmention" per
jury in its schedule of . extraditable
Crimea.* took effect before.it was rati-'
fled, and this the last legislation,
in * Canada .'; regarding, extradition. A
treaty was .necessary, .he said, before,
an extradition act could be made, and
Canada, not havinsr sovereign power,"
could notlmake a, treaty: nor If the
\u2666ixtradifion nets were in operation could
Canada enforce a treaty. Nothing but
war could. do this...
:-. Collins; held 'that there .was no law
In Cana<l;>, covering extradition, .as the
net of ISS6" was nullified by exceeding,
the scope of the "treaty." and 'the act oC
1533- was. defective. . :
Judge Lamprcan has telegraphed to
,the Secretary. #of State for Canada,
through the local Registrar, asking I!
any proclamation bad 'been made, en
forcing the extradition act of ISS9." An â¢
answer is expected before the case ,\u25a0 Is
resumed on Monday. Collins stated to
day in an interview that he would carry
the; case to the Privy Council in Eng
land,--If the Â». Canadian* courts decide'
against hi si, stating he could fight as
long as Gaynor and Greene did.

WORSE THAN THE DISEASE
j The effects of Mercury and Potasli are
worse than the effects of Contagious
Blood Poison, for which these mineral?
are generally used. They cannot cure
the disease, and in addition set up a pois-
on of their own, 1 producing dyspepsia, by
drying up the gastric juices, salivation,
tores, mercurial rheumatism, and often
necrosis of the bones.
Bowline Green, Ky., Mitchell House.
Gentlemen:â l"or orcr four years I suf-
fered greatly from a severe case of Con-
tagious Blood Poison. I went to Hot
BpricgÃ, ctaying- there four months at a
big expense. I then crnsulled physi-
cians, who prescribed Mercury. Noth-
ing did me any good, in fact tho treat*
, ment proved more harz&ful than bencil-
cial. Thus I continued to su;fer for four
years. I mentioned my ccee to a friend
who told me that S. S. S. had certainly
cured him. I at onco commenced its use,
and in sis months could find no traco
of the disease whatever. This was about
two years ago, and thero has been no
signs of return. D.- 21. BA.NDEHS.
S.\ S. S:, a remedy made from roots',
herbs and barks, is the ou!y known an-
tidote for Contagious Blood Poisom It
thoroughly shd permanently eradicates
the poison from the blood so that no sign
is ever seen of the disease in future.
S. S. S. builds up instead of tearing down
the system, as do Mercury and Potash,
and -when it has cured the disease every
part cf the body has been, toned up
by its purifying and tonic effects.
S. S. S. also removes any effects of the
mineral treat-
PUBELY VEGETABLE. S. S. S. contains
a particle of
Mercury, Potash or any othr* mineral.

The question of the authority of the
city police to interfere in county affairs
is still being discussed. It Is.-stated that
even if arrests were made _; the police
could not secure -commitments for .those
arrested, as the Sheriff and deputies here
are hostile to the intrusion of the city
authorities. The cases of the bookmakers
arrested some time ago will come up be
fore the County Court and the "raid" ;
or' to-day is considered besides being .a
joke a mere move to possibly influence
the decision of the jury- io the cases to

Title Against Ward and
- Wright in a Great Match
Result : ever ' in 5 Doubt

ing Set of the Contest
LONDON;. July - 22.â For^ another year
the Dwight.F. Davis international lawn
' tennis trophy will have its home in Eng
land. At Wimbledon to-day Hplcombe
Ward and \ Beals C. AV'right ' tried hard
and desperately -to" take the silver trophy
back to the , land of j its origin. ; and at
one time they were within measureable
distance of their desires, -but R.^. F. -and
H. JJB Doherty," past masters in ; the art
of getting;out of tight corners, suddenly
sprang intoigrand form and snatched vic
tory from the Americans, â¢ thus ' adding
another point to the \u25a0 score in the; chal
lenge; match; which' is now ;3 to 0 In
favor of tho defenders of the trophy.
' Wright played .wonderful, tennis, at ;the
net. court 'and behind the back line. - For
a time Ward was off in his -game,, but
this- made little , difference, to Wright,
who, during his partner's lapse in -form,
played .the Dohertys single-handed. Five
seta were played. The first, which was
won by. the Americans, 10 to 8, was. the
hardest of the contest. Ward constantly
returned the, ball to the net,' but 1 Wright
played steadily, and brilliantly., .The ef
forts . made by the Americans in winning
this set deprived them of some of their
snap, and the. Dohertys easily took the
next two, 6-2, 6-2. The fourth fell to the
Americans, 6-4.
Then came the fifth and deciding set. in
which both teams put forth their every
effort. Ward and Wright took the first,
third, fifth, seventh and .ninth games,
which made the score' 5 to 4 in favor of
America. B. F. Doherty ,-the elder of the
brothers, \u25a0" then took hold, winning the
tenth and twelfth, the Americans taking
the eleventh. The score was tljen 6 to 6.
.In the thirteenth game, -when the score
had reached 40. t0 30 in England's favor
and ;both teams were lobbying the ball
and 'waiting for an opening.- the elder
,Dougherty put up a ball that should
have been killed easily with a smash
stroke.' It \u25a0 went to Ward, who through
too much anxiety hit too easily and
struck the net with his racket, giving the
game to England. The Dohertys ; then
took the" next game in love,- winning the
match and the cup. -'' : â¢
The Americans are greatly pleased with
their visit. *Not a single incident had oc
curred to mar the happy relations be
tween the American , and English tennis
players. â¢ v '
Wright, in speaking to-night of the
trip, said: ;
"It Is not long. to wait for 1906. atwhich
time we will be after that bit of silver
again." - â¢

The Commuters were there with twelve
bingles 1 . yeÃterday, and they stole six
bases, yet the, best they got was a run.
The Seala only punched the leather safely
six times and not a man pjlfered, yet
they grabbed two runs and the game
was theirs. Such . are the fortunes of
baseball. If a team does not have tome
luck it can't win a game with a million
hits. -.>â¢::.. r â¢; ; ; . .-;\u25a0- -\u25a0 . .' -
Throughout the , contest there was a
bunch of Commuters on the bags and it
looked as though they were due to come ;
in at any moment. But they Invariably
stuck ' on the bags and if they did not,
then they \ were caught at the plate.
Three of ; them died this way, cutting off
|ac many runs,; while every Seal who got
' near enough to the rubber always came
:through. : . .
Ij Oakland only fjgured as a run getter, in
the third inning when Van Haltren beat
out a bunt, Francks sacrificed arid ': Dun
leavy shot- one into right, sending Van
:along the line to third. ... Graham beat a
slow one to short and Van registered.
Kruger hit at Gochnauer and he whipped
the ball over to second; Dunleavy started
for the plate and Mohler returned' It in
\u25a0a trice, catching the runner. It was
snapped back again by Danny Shea and
Graham was doubled up. retiring the side

The Pacinc Mall Company's liner Ko
rea sailed yesterday for the Orient with
about $000 tons of freight and silver
treasure valued at $784,560 55. She
carried fewer passengers than usual.

late arrival of company papers from the
Pacific Mail office. Pilot Steve Castle

were cast off. lost no time in getting his
big charge away from the wharf and
headed for the Golden Gatel" Captain
Seabury, the Korea's commander, is
still enjoying his leave of absence, but
the next time the liner ltavts here it
will be with the commodore of the ser
vice on her bridge. To the traveling
public the return of Captain Seabury to
duty will be heralded with delight, but
it will please nobody quite so tnuch as
the officers and crew of the Korea.
Among the passengers for the Orient !
was Admiral Jorge Montt of the Chil
ean navy.
Seventeen Japanese, two of them wo
men, who had been captured trying to '
sneak Jnto the country over the Mexi
can border, were deported on the Korea,

MALONEY'S FALL
CRAZES YOUTH
Neil Wallace Is Driven Mad
by the Sight of Aeronaut
Beings Dashed, to Death
HORKOR PEEYS; ON MIND
Terrible Picture Is Before
Him ;' ' Continually During
Hours of Sleeplessness
When Daniel -Maloney rose gallantly
over the peaceful campus of Santa
Clara College on July 18 and headed the
flight, of the new aeroplane . Into
the clouds, in the great crowd that
stood cheering, below was : Neil .Wal
lace, a 17-year-old, boy from San Fran
cisco, his bright eyes staring in won
derment at the monster 'marvel, in the
air above him. . Then 'before his horrN
tied gaze came the awful tipping of this
mechanical "bird, the crunching J of â its
broken machinery (and the swift rush
from the dizzy height to which .it had
reached to the ground, there ;to dash
to death the daring man who had but a
moment beforo controlled its: slight
est movement.
Neil Wallace saw !t all and on his
heated brain there burned a vivid pic
ture of the catastrophe. He .'\u25a0\u25a0' ran
through the excited crowd, calling for
help at the top of his voice. As the
train bore him away that evening ho
continually cried: "Look! He's falling!
Help!: Help! Cairoiit the ambulance!
Too late! Too lute! Look at his quiv
ering body! The boys, will give him a
military; burial!"
â¢.Yesterday the. lad was sent to'the-in
sane hospital at Napa. July: '18 had
claimed two victims, the one dead, the
other a raving maniac. The . sight of
the accident had proved too much for
the brain cells of the boy . to bear and
they had collapsed under the strain.
Ever since that fatal day he had ; re T
talncd the dreadful picture in his mind
and he had lived the accident / over
again hour after hour. Sleep had been
restless and his nlghts.a dreaming hor
ror. At last his mind gave way. '-'-'.-
The lad lived with his aunt, Mrs.
Rleterman. at 123 Page street. ' He had
lost his mother, brothers and sisters by
death and' this had made him of a som
ber, temperament.' He was a member
of the" League of the Cross Cadets and
had attended St. Ignatius College for
several years. At the time of the acci- ;
dent he was- camping at , Saritat^Clara
with the other cadets. His" aunt took
him to the Emergency Hospital' Friday
night and yesterday Drs.- Wadsworth
and Rethers examined his mental con T
dltion. The father of the boy is work-
Ing at Napa.

Great Loss to Citizens
EoÂ«eial Dlfpntcb to TbÂ« CalL
AUBURN. July 22. â Auburn was the
scene to-day of. a conflagration .which
destroyed property -valued at $100,000.
The flrc brokft out at" 11 a. m. and was
not fully under control until 3 p. m.
It started in the rear of Safford's fur
niture store, located in the Snowden or
Cuyhall building, the ! flnest in the city.
This tirm carries a supply of paints
and oils, as does the Hancock Hard
ware store adjoining. It waa but a
few minutes before the entire Cuyhall
building was on tire inside. The brick
walls melted like putty. The flames
spread rapidly and caused the com
plete destruction of the Snowden build
ing, the Empire Hotel, J. G. Bisbee's
blacksmith shop and residence. Cros
by's livery stable and the -
Hotel. This latter building Is what
saved the rest of the town, as the walla
stood 1 firm and are standing yet.
This building was erected 52 years
ago and on three occasions haa saved
thei town. Other properties badly dam
aged were the postofflce block and the
Central block. The firemen worked hard,
but were handicapped by a poor water
supply. The day was hot and there
were, many prostrations. - Women
worked as well as men. Among the
fair nremen were Miss Alice Grossman
and iMiss Bell.
' \u25a0 The nre involves great loss to what
is known as Lower Auburn. - the old
town. Outside of Mrs. .Crosby, it Is
doubted if any others will rebuild-. The
losses and insurance - follow: â¢

liOOKING FOR A PLACB TO ZXTSI
WHT NOT EAST OAKLAND?
Too can buy to-day for Just *mÂ»-hal! what
you can a year hence. There Is no place in tho
bay counties where you can buy property of
equal value for so low a pries as East Oak-
land. â¢ '
Since the Western Pacific's big purchase of
$730,000 prices have advanced about 10 pÂ«r
cent. That tbey will advance/ 50 per cent in
the next six months is a conservative estimate.
Almost dally are buyers coming to East Oak-
land for factory sites. This past week tha
Union Gas Engine Company, also the Dow
Pump and Engine Company purchased factory
sites on the water front
With no less than five factories la course of
construction along the water* front of East
Oakland, the coming of the Western Pacific
means an increase of at 'least 20.000 la tha
population of East Oakland in the next two
years.
East Oakland is 34 minutea from San Fran-
cisco, with a 20-minuta train servic* and boats
up to 1 :30 a- m, , . . , r~. . .
This years over sixty miles of sewerags was
laid and $150,CC0 was spent for street work.

SUES A UNION - \u25a0
FOR fIMUCES
Epedal Diepatcb to Tb* C&IL
CHICAGO. July 22.â Conspiracy to drive
a man to suicide and malicious prosecu
tion have been charged against fourteen
members of -the International -Glass
workers* Association In Chicago. The
charges are in connection with a suit
for $29,000 damages begun in the Superior
Court to-day against the union men men
tioned.
With the filing of the damage suit by
Morr's Grose, former treasurer of . the
Chicago branch of the association. 1* re
vealed a story of alleged persecution ex
tending over nearly three years. In that
time Grcfre says he has been compelled
to become an outcast from the union and
to fee from Chicago" to make a living
for himself and his aged .mother.
Grose was treasurer of the union at the
time when the disappearance of money
and valuables from the safe deposit
vaults in Masonic Temple attracted atten
tion. The perpetrators of the thefts es
caped undetected and unpunished and
Grose, it is said, became Indirectly one
cf their victims.
All money of the society was deposited
in the vault in the Masonic Temple.
When an accounting was demanded of
Grose it developed that the ca*h on hand
was short J4SO. Grose was accused of em
bezzling It. He denied the charge and
la!d the theft 'of money to the- depreda
tions of th*Â» vault thieves.
Embezzlement charges followed before
a Grand Jury. Grose was arrested. An
indictment and a trial followed and the
jury acquitted the prisoner.
The treasurer of the Glassworker6 f
Union was expelled from the union. For
several months he sought other employ
ment in Chicago and he even abandoned
hie work as a glass factor and took up
other employment. Wherever, he turned
there wif the blacklist of his union and
the demand was made that he be. dis
charged whenever be got work, he de
clares. -.- . .

fore the Lincoln Club of Boston, at Its
midsummer outing here', to-day, gave
a resume of the Government's proceed
ings against the combination of beef
packers. The Attorney General said
that his conclusion .to review the- situa
tion was due to the "not unnatural mis
understanding as to the attitude of the
administration." He said also that it
was done "with the approval' of the
President."
Mr. Moody's address in part was as
follows:
"There has been an occasional com
plaint that upon subjects in which the
public naturally takes a keen interest,
I have, as Attorney General, withheld
facts which the people have a right to
know. Much of rhe work of the De
partment of Justice can. only be done
efficiently when it is done quietly and
in secret. It is not easy to draw the
line between facts which ought to be
confided to the public and those which
for thÂ« time being in the interest of
public Justice ought to be withheld
from It There has been - much "not
unnatural misunderstanding as to the
attitude of the administration._toward
the proceedings at Chicago which have
resulted in indictments against the
beef packers. v r
\K-\OI FILES BILL.
"In May, 1902, Attorney General Knox
filed a bill in equity in the Circut Court
of the* "United States at Chicago in
which it was alleged that the defend
ants (seven corporations, one co-part
nership and twenty-three individuals)
had entered into a combination by
which they conspired to suppress com
petition In the purchase. oC livestock
and in the sale of fresh meat;through
out the country and for the obtaining of
rebates from common carriers on ac
count of their shipments of meat.
"The case was placed in the immediate
charge of Mr. Bethea.then' District At
torney for the Northern District of Il
linois, and Mr. Daly, the -accomplished
associate to the Attorney General, who
has now, I regret to say, ; reslgned'-his
position In the public service. In Feb
ruary, -1903, the] demurrer of the de
fendants to this bill was overruled tn an
opinion by Judge Grosscup. ' -
"In May," 1903, an injunction was issued
against all' the defendants forbidding
the. continuance of the conspiracies al
leged in the bill. The- defendants ap-'
pealed to the Supreme Court of the
United States and in January, 1905, with
the assistance of Mr. Day, 1 argued the
case before that court In the same
month the case was decided in favor of
the Government by an unanimous court
and the decree of the Circuit Court was
affirmed in all substantial particulars..
The District Attorney on February ' 4/
1905, reported that at that time there
was not sufficient- evidence to-sustaln
either, an indictment or proceedings for
contempt, but that sufficient facts had
been developed to warrant the summon
ing of the Grand Jury tor Investigation
of the whole case. .. ... .â¢\u25a0 .
INVESTIGATION BEGINS.
"On March 20, 1005, t the Grand Jury
assembled. at. Chicago and the investi
gation began. Supplementary investi
gations were undertaken by grand
juries In New York, Texas arid Nebras
ka. During: the investigation^ per
sons whose testimony was believed to
be of Importance fled to Canada and
Europe, some of them under, assumed
names. The Grand Jury returned two
indictments against persons, charging
them with . corruptly. Influencing
ncspfis. â¢
"After the investigation had been in
progress somewhat longer than two
months ,th#Â» Grand Jury took a reccs*
and the District "Attorney reported to
me the condition, of the investigation.
"On the '\u25a0first day of July last, the
Grand Jury returned an Indictment
with t%ni counts against various indi
viduals and corporations charging vari
ous violations of the .-so-called anti
trust act, and; another indictment
agninst-tho managers and employes of
on* of the parking-houses for a con
spiracy to obtain rebates from the rail
roads In the transportation of their
products.
"It is" my hope and belief that
these indictments may be brought to
trial during 1 the current year. " In the
meantime, both the principles of. law
and .a sense of fair play require us all
to hold our judgments in euspense. The
action of the Grand Jury was the re
sult of an'exparte Investigation. The
ac^uÃed have not been heard. .They are
one and air presumed , innocent That
presumption for their protection f fol
lows them until the case has been pass
ed upon by the trial Jury. Let -us hope
that- Its verdict will ,be a declaration
of truth-in fact, as It Is In name,",

FATA LLY BEATEN
BY HOLD-UP MEN
OAKLAND, July 22.â Thomas W. Cook,
who lives at, 1605 Fruitvale avenue.! was
held up to-night at 9 o'clock while on
his way., home" from/ the store of hla
brother, F. \u25a0.Bv:Cook, v at 1286 Twenty-third
avenue, and/ after ; being beaten Into in
sensibility Jby the, thugs, was' robbed of
more than $200 and left for dead in the
road. | . '..-\u25a0
After^lying 1 unconscious for almost an
hour, -the young, man '\u25a0. recovered suffi
ciently; to reach his home, and, stagger-
Ing Into the house, collapsed \ before he
could say any more than j that he had
beenattacked and. robbed by. footpads.
His recovery is extremely doubtful.*.
Dr. J. H. Callenwas hurriedly sum
moned, but by the time he reached the
house Cook had relapsed into insensi
bility and up to. a late hour had failed
to regain consciousness. Dr.'Callen
found that the man had been struck
repeatedly with some heavy instrument,'
his head being a mass of cuts and
bruises arid his left eye closed.
I Shortly after Cook made his way home
L. A. Stepbehson, who was passing in an
automobile,, found; his hat at the scene
of the holdup, but, there .was no trace of
the perpetrators of the bridal crime.
Cook's sister at once notified Sheriff
Frank Barnett, who went to the \u25a0 scene,
but after a long investgiation: he was
unable to gain the slightest clew. ' :
The footpads were evidently old hands,
for they took only the cash which their
victim carried. leaving his gold watch.'
It .is believed *that they had watched
Cook and knew that he took the money
home ; from the j store each -evening." Â»At
midnight Dr. Calleri, said i that Cook's in
juries would ; probably "prove fatal, as
there Is every indication of concussion
of the brain. --:'

BOMB VICTIMS
Explosive Hurled at Abdul

Soldiers of His Escort
SULTAN SHOWS PLUCK
Calmly Enters His jj Carriage
and Holds the Eeins on a
Drive to the Yildiz Kiosk
CONSTANTINOPLE, July 33.â -The
commission appointed to Inquire Into
the attempt upon the 11/e of the Sultan
yesterday has ; ascertained that the ex
plosion caused the, death of 24 persons
and wounded 67. In addition 53 homes
were Injured. . The lnvotlcation* show
the* outrage was committed by. two
Hungarians. ' :
CONSTANTINOPLE, Friday. July 21.
The bomb which was Intended to
blow up the Sultan fell short- and ex
ploded'- about thirty yards from his
Majesty. "The latter was at the time on
the top step of the flight leading, from
the Mosque. A panic immediately
seized the Sultan's entourage and the
court .'dignitaries rushed up and- im
plored Abdul Hamid to remain In the
Moseiue. 'The Sultan," however.^insisted
on proceeding and entered : his carriagu
with a calmness not usually attributed
to him. r: Picking" up the relns, : he drove
to the â¢ Yildiz Palace, amid the cheers
of the admiring: officials. "\u25a0 .
The explosion' was" heard as .far as
the Pera quirie.fl Besides the soldiers
in " the vicinity, " several horses- were
killed, carriages . were smashed into
matchwood and' thÂ© windows of the pa
vilion reserved for the diplomatic
corps were broken. -The pavilion con
tained, among others, U. Grant Smith,
'second secretary of the American lega
tion- here, who accompanied by
Captain Smiley, Qf the United States
army. No one, wair hurt in the pavilion
with the exception of a few attend
ants, who received scratches from fly
ing glass. ' . .
The force of the explosion also dam
aged the clock tower in the courtyard
of the Mosque. . . .
. Immediately after the Sultan had de
parted, a" detachment of ' cavalry
charged down the street parallel with
the Mosque and from which the bomb
was thrown, in the hope of finding the
author of the attempt,, who. however,
has not yet been discovered.
Although the outrage occurred at 1
o'clock in the afternoon, the fact that
his Majesty's life had been In danger
did not become generally known until
night, when it aroused widespread ex
citement, as it was the first bomb ex
plosion of this character that ever oc
curred .in Constantinople.
The majority of those killed or in
jured were soldiers who were lining
the road near the Mosque." The author
ities are* greatly disturbed and; unable
to explain how the would-be regicide
passed \ through the cordon -of troops,
which always bars the' roads leading
to the Mosque as \u25a0 soon as the Sultan
leaves the ! palace. - >; ' " ' :

22.â This was a gala day .for the League
of the ' Cross Cadets at their, camp. The
sham battle, which yesterday was de
clared a draw, was resumed this morn-
Ing by the same oposing forces. Because
of the fear that the cadets would in their
excitement hurt one another -with their

without arms. Colonel Power, commanded
the browns ; and Major McKlnley the
blues. Referee Henderson decided the
browns - won. The strategy of the com
manders .was . shown In the. defense- and
attack of Camp Culleri, but whaa the
time was. up it was. found that Colonel
Power had succeeded in making the most
prisoners and that his . forces were the
n-ost advantageously deployed.

not enter the Unted States when they
visit thÂ« Toronto Exhibition In August.
The communication has been made In a
document marked "private and confiden

cision arrived at. Tha Irishmen cannot
understand why they should be thus
barred from the "United States, consider
ing'that special provision was made for
the Grenadiers' Band to visit : the St.

I have It- on sound authority, however,
that the English War Office has .been

from Washington that the Irish-Ameri

the appearance of the Irish Guards Band
In the city tha occasion for a hostile de

the place to do service. . The discharged
servants laughed at the predicament in
which they thought they had left their
mistress. But Lady Bateman Is a wom
an of resource who can afford to regard,
the question of expense as a trivial de
tail. She locked the house up," leaving an
ex-policeman In charge and went straight
to Clarldge's .Hotel. She then communi

for servants stipulating that none :but
American or French applicants for a situ
