AND INTERRUPTS FUNERAL
RENO. Sept. 12.â The scene of tne
wreck is at a curve half a mile beyond
Laughtons. This curve Is concave and
the view is unobstructed for a long
distance save by some trees at an In
dian ranch. Where the two trains came
together there is ample evidence of the
terrible impact of the collision. There
were two heavy engines on each train.
The first engine on No. 6 lies a mass of
crumpled iron, half buried in the mud
beside the road. It was hurled from
the track like a toy. A workman who
saw the collision from a field near by
stated that No. 6 had slowed down and
was hardly moving when struck by
Ncr. 5, which had only a few moments
before put on brakes; that when they
struck No. 5 seemed to toss the first
engine aside and weld Its head Into
the second engine, when all the engines
6eemed to close together.
Of the two baggage cars the one on
No. 6 is telescoped by the tender, while
that of No. 5 lies a mass of kindling
w<-od down in the roadway. Back of
this was a chair car, in which were
five people, all of whom escaped with
bruises. This car lies bottom- upward,
the sides crushed in and filled with a
tangled marg of iron and debris. How
a human being could survive in it sur
paEses-lmajdnatlon. . .

Â¦Captain Berlinsky voluntarily offered
to allow the' Government's- experts to
inspect the vessel at once, to verify
his statement. In short, the Russian
officer's explanations mean- that his
ship is crippled and that he cannot get
out of port" short of several months'
delay. : . ~ .' , . j
Officials high in authority say this
means that the Lena will be disman
tled and laid up at the port until the
war is ended. The Government," it has
been pointed out, will not permit the.

port after such a stay as Captain Ber-
Unsky himself asserts will be necessary
to put the steamer into seaworthy con
dition. This being proved a fact, as
may be ascertained by the examination

the next step will be to order the Lena
Admiral Caspar F. Goodrich at 6
o'clock last evening received from the
Russian Consul, Paul Kosakevltch, and
Captain Berlinsky of the Lena, a writ
ten statement concerning the condi
tion of the auxiliary cruiser. In that
formal presentation Â¦ It was declared
that several months' work would be
necessary before the Lena would be in
a condition to leave port. . Captain Ber
linsky said the engines' needed a com
plete overhauling; and that the boilers
would have to be practically rebuilt.
' In making his statement Captain
Berlinsky declared that it must take
not less than four months and possibly
eight months to do the. work that he
set forth as needed to make the cruiser
seaworthy. Without comment, a copy
of Captain Berlinsky's . statement was
telegraphed last night by Admiral
Goodrich to the Navy Department.

followed a thrilling race ten miles
across country by the robbers and a
small posse in pursuit. The robbers
were frequently in sight at first, but
having a rubber tired runabout, while
their pursuers were in heavier vehicles,
they eluded capture for the time. To
night Sheriffs and bloodhounds are
searching the vicinity where trace of

KOMAIVS CONFESSION A FARE.
SAN RAFAEL, Sept. 12.â The forest
fire which has been raging upon the
Bolinas Ridge for . the last â¢ five days
has at last been subdued and the fire
fighters, nearly dead from exhaustion,
have returned to their homes for a
much needed rest.
Residents from Bolinas and the
towns surrounding the burned district
visited San Rafael for the first time
to-day since the fire started. They
were. unable to drive owing to the- con
dition of the roads. Although the
flames have died down dense clouds of
smoke arise from the hot embers and
people residing many miles from the
scene of the blaze would imagine that
the fire was still raging.
The fire, since it started, has de
stroyed over twenty thousand acres of
timber, has burned the Summit House
on Bolinas Ridge, has destroyed the
outbuildings of many farms and de
voured many cords of tan bark and cut
wood' belonging to Pedrini Brothers of
the John Enos Valley. The fire would
probably have reached Ross Valley had
not County Treasurer Fallon, with a
gang of men, dug a trench which
blocked the flames. About ten men
will patrol the burned district to-night
and see that the blaze does not start
afresh.

Boyd. It is alleged that there was a
misunderstanding of orders and that
this train should have remained at
Laughtons until both sections of No.
6 had passed, but instead of that it
pulled out after the first section only
had passed it. The railroad officials
are very reluctant about giving out
any information, but there is little
question but the accident was due to
a misunderstanding of orders and not
to an error of a dispatcher.
FIRE AT LAST
EXTINGUISHED
The vehicle was drawn by two spir
ited animals. While passing through
the prison grounds their horses were
startled by a rapidly approaching auto
mobile. Mrs. Johnson, .who was driv
ing, was unable to restrain the team.
They plunged over the side of the road,
at' the same time hurling her to the
ground. Mrs. Martens grasped the
reins, endeavoring to check the fright
ened animals, but in spite of her efforts
the rig was overturned and Mrs. Mar
tens and her child were thrown to the
ground.
The two ladies were badly bruised
and the little girl's arm was broken.
How the occupants of the rig escaped
death is little short, of a miracle. Dr.
Casey, the resident physician of San
Quentin, attended the â¢ unfortunates,
and after their Injuries were dressed
they were dispatched in the automobile
that caused the mishap to their homes
in San Rafael.
SAN RAFAEL, Sept. 12.â A large red
automobile was the cause of a serious
runaway accident this afternoon, re
sulting in one severe casualty and the
painful bruising of two other persons.
Mrs. F. Martens of Hamburg and her
little daughter, who are in San Rafael

city, were out driving with Mrs. John

train was to blame for the accident.
It was claimed by the officials that
the two trains had received orders to
meet at Lawton, but Engineer Isoard
apparently ignored this order and the
collision resulted.
"According to advices received by
this department," remarked Chief
Clerk Montgomery, of Manager Agler's
office, "Isoard evidently overlooked the
fact that he had not passed all the sec
tions of train No. 6 and instead of
stopping at Lawton, as his instructions
read, he continued on the run past that
station until he. collided with the train
approaching from an opposite direction.
The collision occurred .on a curve in the
track, where, fortunately, the trains
were not running at a high rate of
speed."
The Southern Pacific Company's of
ficials deeply deplored the accident, not
only because it resulted in the injury
of a number of passengers, but because
it marred the splendid record it had
made in handling the large number of
people from the East who attended the
Knights Templar Conclave.

A second riot took place in Root

| CALL BUREAU/WORLD'S FAIR,
;'ST. LOUIS, Sept. 12. â The wise ex
j hibitor at an exposition, like a wise
j showman, tries to "think up" some
| tiling; tluuLwill "make a hit" with the
i public, attract attention and arouse
; comment. _To get the light thing is
: not easy, but Santa Clara County has
secured it in the recipe pamphlet it is
giving away at its dried fruit pavilion
; in the Palace of Agriculture. That
i county has surely made a hit with the
booklet, that tells all about how to
cook prunes and other dried fruits.
J Its popularity was greater than any
j body dreamed of when it was first is
i sued, for there is not one on hand
j now- and rush orders have been given
j for the printing of more. In the mean
! time there is a daily inquiry by ladies
! who want to secure copies as to when
more will arrive, and it will take a
week to fill all the mall orders left for
the book. :
The recipe pamphlet is an unpreten
tious thing to produce such a commo
tion. Its introductory pages contain
a treatise on the benefits of the use of
dried fruits â their value as a food and
so forth, by Volney Rattan, profes
sor of .botany at the State Normal
School at San Jose. Following this
are 100 recipesâ .-sixteen for the cook
ing'of prunes, sixteen for raisins and
the rest for the cooking of dried fruits
in general and the making of glace
fruits, jellies and marmalades.
The recipes are all tried and true.
They are the result of the combined
wisdom and experience of some of the
best known housewives of Santa Clara
County, so there can be no mistake
about any of them. That is the reason
of their instantaneous and widespread
popularity. They are a home product,
like the prunes, and consequently bear
the stamps of genuineness and excel
lence. . They were obtained through a
prize competition inaugurated by the
Farmers' Club three years ago. Of
the vast number of original recipes en
tered in the competition 100 were se
lected. These 100 are contained in the
booklet that has been distributed at
j Santa Clara's prune demonstrating
, stand and will be distributed again as
i soon as some more arrive.

ST. PETERSBURG, Sept 13, 2 a. m.
â With the lull in military operations
and an. almost entire suspension of dis
patches from the front, St. Petersburg
has again fallen back upon rumors.
Countless stories are afloat regarding
the Russian defeat at Liaoyang, some
of which are absolutely absurd. Of
first importance is the revival of the
rumor of Viceroy Alexleff's resignation,
based probably upon differences said
to exist. between him and General Ku
ropatkin and others in authority In
the Far East. Of next importance Is
the rumor that General Kuropatkin Is
to be superseded, j Lieutenant General
LInevitch being named - as the most
probable successor. This Is supposed
to rest upon the Emperor's displeasure
with Kuropatkln's generalship at Li
aoyang and the general dissatisfaction
with the course of events at the front.
Many other rumors are probably the
outgrowth of jealousy, bickerings and
irresponsible criticism of the defeat at
Liaoyang, but none is traceable to an
authoritative source. Nevertheless, in
a country where the will of one man is
the supreme law, sudden changes of
the most grave Importance are always
pcssible. Neither Alexleff's nor Kuro
patkin's friends, however, seem to at
tach great importance to the stories in
volving them.
One Report Is That Linevltch Is to
Succeed Kuropatkin.
WILD RUMORS IX RUSSIA.
In the past the Japanese have de

their contention on the vicious wounds
made by the bullets when they. struck

they found dumdum ammunition 'in
the field at Liaoyang. This evidence is
not considered conclusive, however.
It is now reported upon good au

the Japanese upon the Russian

The Collector's telegram officially
notifying the authorities of the arrival
of the Lena and of Japan's protest,
was addressed to the Secretary of the
Treasury, who at once cent copies to
Acting Secretary of State Adee and to
Acting Secretary Murray of the De
partment of Commerce and Labor,
which also has Jurisdiction in the mat
ter. Collector Stratton's telegram
reads as follows:
Japanese Cbn?ul has made demand upon me
that the Russian auxiliary cruiser Lena, arriv
ing at this port on the 11th inst.. leave within
twenty-four hours. The captain reports that
he has entered for repairs of engines and
boilers, principally the latter. I am request

an examination of the vessel's machinery,
with the consent of the Russian Consul and
the commander of the Lena. I can find no au
thority In the law or regulations for the Col
lector assuming any authority in the prem
ises and request instructions.
After a conference witn the Commis
sioner of Navigation, Acting Secretary
Murray sent the following dispatch; to
the Collector:
Your telegram addressed to thÂ« Secretary of
the Treasury ooncernlng the Russian steam
ship Lena received at 4:40 p. m. You should
have addressed this department as directed In
circular 29. Wire this department the hour
of steamer's arrival at your port and concise
resume of steamboat Inspector's report, and,
if repairs Â«re necessary, the probable time re
quired to make them. On receipt of particulars
the department will Instruct you further. See
circular 29, end of page 2. and all of page li.
The circular referred to was Issued
on February 23, 1904, immediately after
.hostilities between Japan and Russia
began, and, besides containing the Pres
ident's proclamation and provisions of
the statutes relating to neutrality, gave
instructions to Collectors that, "should
any case arise requiring official action,
you will communicate the facts by tel
egram to the department."
The Collector's telegram came after
office hours and the commissioners
were somewhat puzzled that there was
so much delay in sending it. There was
a great deal of reticence on the sub
ject on the part of the Department of
Commerce and the Bureau of Naviga
tion, which preferred to wait the re
pcrt of the steamboat inspector before
making any statement. This report,
it is expected, will be received some
time during the night, so that the Lena
will have been In port over twenty-four
hours before the question of her right
to tie up for repairs is determined.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 12.â The ex

TOKIO. Sept. 12yâ An additional re
port, from the headquarters of the
Japanese army, concerning dumdum
bullets, says:
"Among the rifle ammunition cap
tured at Liaoyang are two kinds of
dumdum bullets, which very much re
semble those made for the Russian
rifle -of the 1891 type. They do not,
however, fit this rifle exactly. We
made a search for rifles which could
have fired these bullets, but failed to
find them. The wounds' received by
seme of our men are comparatively
large and It. seems likely that they
were made by dumdum bullets. We
have, however, been unable to ascer
tain this definitely."

Rifles to Match Them.
PARIS, Sept. 13. â The Journal's
Liaoyang correspondent, having rid
den to Tientsin, sends thence the fol
lowing uncensored dispatch, under
date of September 12:
"The first part of the campaign may
be considered lost. The Russian army
has retreated northward, in the direc
tion of Tie Pass, or further. The Rus
sian army's inferiority in men, guns
and enthusiasm prevented Kuropat
,kin's resisting longer at Liaoyang or
achieving at Yfintai a .victory which
wouldtjhave obliged the Japanese to
faJl back. The Japanese will shortly
triumphantly enter Mukden.
"The Russian general staff now esti
mates the Japanese forces at from
450.000 to 500,000.
"The Russian army will reconcen
trate in the north, but It needs sev
eral months in order to fill up the
losses in a number of corps wh'ch
must .be doubled,, and- to -replace^the
reservists with active troops. Above
all, it is essential to restore the morale,
affected by almost unprecedented
trials and difficulties.
"A Russian offensive movement will
be impossible for a long time. Should
Russia be determined to continue the
effort it might still vanquish, but at a
cost wholly disproportionate to the re
sults. As an impartial witness, I am
convinced that It would be to the best
interests of the belligerents to sink
national pride, and. by mutual conces
sions, end a war which otherwise will
ruin both."

LIAOYANG, Sept. 8, via Tientsin,
Sept. 12.â The looting of Liaoyang has
few parallels in the annals of warfare.
Three armies on three different days
had possession of the city and engaged
in acts of depredation.
When the Russians entered into the
occupation of Liaoyang they built a
model Russian city outside the old
walled Chinese city, and thousands
of troops were lodged within its gates.
When the Japanese drove the Russians
out of the Shansampo Hills the Rus
sian soldiers realized that the town
must fall and forgot all discipline. They
looted the town, sparing neither Chi
nese nor European shops, destroying
what they could not carry away. They
wantonly destroyed great quantities of
foodstuffs and other goods, ripping open
bales, bags and boxes with the ever
ready bayonet and scattering the con
tents over the streets. Much liquor was
found, and the soldiers, becoming
drunk, committed further excesses.
During the Interim between the de
parture of the Russians and the ar
rival of the Japanese the Chinese sol
diers and police finished the ,work the
Russians began, pillaging the shops
that were not found by the Russians.
Then when the Japanese came they
completed the looting. They had been
fighting for five days without food ex
cept dry rice, and broke loose upon en
tering the town. The Japanese looted
right and left. The shops having al
ready suffered, the Japanese turned
their attention to the private houses.
They wanted food principally, but over
looked nothing.
This was the first time in this war
that the' Japanese were guilty of looting
a captured city, and their officers were
much disturbed by. the outbreak. 5 When
order wag restored \ the Japanese sol
diers were taken. out of the walled city
>and now are not allowed inside without
a special pass.
The Russians burned great quantities
of supplies. Food in the Chinese city
is very scarce.
Not until the night of September 3,
after five days of continuous battle, did
the Russians take the first steps of
retreat. With an almost unfordable
and wide river at his back and a strong
force of Japanese opposing him in the
rear and on the flank. General Kuro
patkin was able to withdraw his army
without losing a single gun.
One result of this battle has been to
give the Japanese a much higher opin
ion of the abilities of their antagonists
than the exhibitions at the Yalu River
and elsewhere compelled them to enter
tain. To-day the Japanese army is self
possessed and it has indulged in no
demonstrations of rejoicing 1 .
The work done by the Russians in
preparing the neighborhood of Liao
yang- to be a theater of battle Is of In
credible magnitude. In addition to the
extensive fortifications on ' the south
side of the Taitse River there were
practically three lines of defenses for
the protection of the eastern approaches
of the railroad, which In themselves
constituted a formidable battle area.
The fighting was carried right up to
the railroad line, but notwithstanding
the fact that the Japanese shelled the
last trains which left Liaoyang on the
way to Mukden, it was impossible for
them to intercept any of the Russian
rear guard.
The area north of the river which
was fought over by the contending
armies presents a terrible picture of the
results of the war. The fields are dug
with hundreds of lines of trenches,
marking the successive stages of re
treat, and crematory flres are yet burn r
ing where searching parties are bring
ing in Japanese bodies. Graves of Rus
sian soldiers can be seen at every turn,
some dug by comrades and others by
Japanese. On one hillside is a group
of two or three hundred graves marked
by rough sticks. Many bodies remained
undiscovered in the high grain. Flocks
of crows hover about and hundreds of
Chinese dogs roam the fields.
The foreign military observers with
the Japanese army find convincing evi
dences that General Kuropatkin plan
ned to defeat the Japanese armies in
detail and then to dispatch a powerful
column to the south for the relief of
Port Arthur and they are of the opin
ion that with the thirteen divisions at
his command General Kuropatkin
could have accomplished this had the
quality of his officers and soldiers
equaled that of the Japanese.
The execution of a campaign by the
Japanese upon such a vast scale
against an army probably their su
perior In numbers and possessing more
modern guns of greater caliber and
range than theirs, established behind
fortifications of gTeat completeness* and
unprecedented extent, and directed by
skillful commanders, excites the high
est admiration of the military critics.
It is unquestioned that at Liaoyang
General Kuropatkin expected to turn
the tide of war against the Japanese.
It would now appear that the fighting
of the past few weeksâ since the fail
ure of the Russian movement to the
south â was not expected to be decisive,
but was a series of preliminary opera
tions conducted for the purpose of har
assing the Japanese and gaining time
for the crucial struggle.
GENERAL KUROKI'S HEAD
QUARTERS IN THE FIELD, Sept. 8.

nificent victory of which the Japanese
have reason to be proud, although they
were unable to realize their hopes of

LOXDOX. Sept. 13. â In a dispatch
to the Dally Telegraph the corre
spondent of the paper In the field with
General Kuroki says:
"The Russians made a very poor
stand, on the heights beyond the Tai
tse River. At Anping: extensive
trenches had been dug on the cliffs
overlooking the river opposite and
above the town, but the first- few shells
from the Japanese batteries sent the
enemy flying-. I was amazed to see of
ficers leading the way in the headlong:
flight -across the hill and down into
the valley behind. The officers were
easily distinguishable in the forefront
of the crowd of fugitives."
The correspondent graphically de
scribes the fighting: for posession of a
hill at Heiyingtai (about fifteen miles
irortheast of Liaoyangr). the key of the
Russiaji position and upon the seiz
ure of which deoended the success of
General Kuroki's flank movement, and
describes the ! terrible punishment the
Japanese sustained in capturing- it.
After the capture there was a Aouble
night attack, the Japanese trying to
capture a battery that had annoyed
them during- the day and the Russians
seeking- to recapture Heiyingtai.
"Xeither desperate venture succeed
ed. The Russians were repeatedly
near gaining the summit, but were
swept away each time by Japanese
bayonets and bullets. On the other
side the Japanese attack on the Rus
sian battery was defeated by electrical
devices the Russians had arranged,
giving them the exact position of the
assaulting- party. The brave Japan
ese were mowed" in swaths in front of
the Russian guns, one battalion being
annihilated. Visiting the hillside af
terward, It was almost impossible to
avoid stepping- into pools of blood. The
field was littered with broken weapons
and the grimmest of all these were
hundreds of broken or twisted bay
onets."

Once again the fleet is to go out, im
mediately afterward the ships unfit
to go to sea are to be blown up and
then General Stoessel. who has been
decorated with the highest order for
bravery, will be instructed to surren
der the fortress.
This accomplished and Russian
honor having: been fully vindicated by
its gallant, defense, the garrison was
to give up the fort in order to save
further useless loss of life. This hu
mane intention was frustrated by Ad
miral Oukhtomsky's defiance of in
structions when he returned with the
shattered fleet to Port Arthur.
ST. PETERSBURG, Sept. 12. â Gen
eral Stoessel's message of thanks to
the Emperor in return for the Cross
of St. George of the third degree is
published this morning:, having occu
pied six days in reaching this country.
Apropos of this message, a friend of
the heroic commander of Port Ar
thur tells the following- rather sensa
tional story:
After deliberation of the highest au
thority of the land the decision was
reached that it was useless to hold
Port Arthur except for the value of
the warships there. an
imperial order was given to the Port
Arthur fleet to go out to battle and
Admiral Withoeft, with his dying:
breath, during: the sea battle off Port

bor.

pair. One blgr cruiser, which was in
the great naval battle off Port Arthur,
had all her funnels shot away and
twenty-five holes in her hull.
The Collector wired to Washington
a statement of the demand of the Jap
anese Consul and in reply was direct
ed to ascertain the correctness of the
Russian commander's representations
as to the disabled boilers.
The Collector sent for Captain A. T.
Berlinsky, commander of the Lena,
and Paul Xosakevitch, the Russian
Consul, to inform them of his instruc
tions. But the matter of arranging
this conference taxed his patience
somewhat. First the Russian digmi
taries sent word that they â¢would be
at the offices of the Collector of the
Port at 2 o'clock. They failed to come,
however, but sent word that they
The following, section 52S8 of the Re
vised Statutes, was the only enlighten
ment Collector Stratton could find In
his search for authority:
It Â«-ha!l be lawful lor the President or such
rxT6on as he eh&Il empower for that purpose
to employ such part of the land or naval forces
of the United States or of the militia thereof
** tha.ll t>Â« necessary to compel any foreign
v?w! to depart froai the United States In all
case* la which by the law of nations or the
treaties of the United States she ought not
to remain within the United States.
The day's problems for Collector
Stratton began early. Shortly after 9
o'clock came K. Uyeno, the local Japa
nese Consul, with a demand that the
Hussian warship be ordered to leave
port within twenty-four hours. The
Consul declared that the United States
Government was expected strictly to
enforce tbe neutrality laws against the
Lena.
Stratton declined to take any action
whatever at that time.
' "I am in doubt as to how far I have
any authority, if at all. In this matter,"
paid the Collector. "But I will say that
the United States will act on its own
initiative ajid will insist on its neutral
ity -without regard to the request of
parties interested. I know thoroughly
Â¦what the international law is about the
vessel remaining here. But a warship
of a foreign power does not enter or
clear through the custom-house, and I
am therefore In doubt as to my author
ity under International law."
POWER COXFERRED.
Collector Stratum's brow was knit
and his mouth closed to interviewers
throughout the day, as befits a thor
ough diplomat. He was without a
course during the forenoon, for his au
thority in the situation was undefined
and it was some hours before he heard
from Washington. He was not lack
ing In knowledge of the international
law to be applied in the premises, but
who was to represent the United States
Government in enforcing the law was
a question that perusal of Federal
statutes would not determine.
It arrears that in such cases it rests
with the President to designate who
shall conduct the immediate negotia
tions. In response to a request for in
structions Stratton received a message
!n the afternoon from the acting Sec
retary of Commerce and Labor, Law
rtnoe O. Murray, ordering him to take
full charge of the Lena's case. The mat
ter fell to the Department of Commerce
and Labor because of its control over
navigation affairs, and the Collector is
attached to this department as well as
to the Treasury.
While Admiral Goodrich was acting
on his own authority, the Collector of
the Port, F. S. Stratton, proceeded in
dependently as the representative of
the Department of Commerce and
Labor. Stratton made arrangements
to have the Lena examined by J. K.
Bulger, inspector of hulls and boilers,
to-day. This was after a hard day's
work of conferences and misgivings as
to the purposes of the Russian com
mander.
COLLECTORS' POSITTOX.
The statement of the repairs needed
to make the Lena seaworthy was forth
coming after Admiral Goodrich had
ordered Captain Berlinsky to leave
port by S o'clock this morning. The
invitation of Captain Berlinsky that
his ship be inspected was accepted and
Admiral Goodrich sent an engineer to
make an investigation. The engineer's
report was not given out by the ad
miral, who forwarded it to Washing

A number of Japanese went out In
a small launch, apparently with the
purpose of boarding: the stranger, but
as they gave no plausible reason for
their visit they were compelled to put
about and send their boat in another
direction. They however contented
themselves with taking: 'numerous
snapshots from long: range.
All day long all kinds of craft load
ed with hundreds of sightseers sailed
about the foreign war ship, but kept a
respectful distance and made no at
tempt to board her.
Early yesterday morning: Admiral C.
F. Goodrich, commandant of the United
States fleet in the harbor, ordered the
Paul Jones, in command of Lieutenant
G. C. " Davison, to steam down
the bay and anchor close to the
Lena, and to act as a sort of body
guard to the visitor. The launch of
the Marblehead was also ordered to act
as a patrol boat about. the I^ena. This
was done to keep off any suspicious
characters that might want to board
or approach the Russian transport.
The vigil was well kept, and every boat
approaching the Lena was challenged,
so that only those who had right or
business on board the Russian ship
were permitted near her gangplank.
Early in the morning official calls
were made upon Captain Berlinsky
by Captain Hunker of the Xew York,
Commander John Hubbard of the
Boston, Commander K. Xiles of the
Bennington. Commander F. S. Phelps
Jr. of the Marblehead. and Lieutenant
G. C. Davison of the Paul Jones.
Later a number of Russian civilians
went alongside and were welcomed' on

The Consul acted as interpreter and
through him Captain Berjinsky ex
plained that he had come to San
Francisco to repair his boilers and en
gines, which had undergone heavy
strain since he left Vladivostok five
weeks ag-o.
"I had plenty of coal aboard and am
in no straits whatever except as to the
boilers and engines," asserted Captain
Berlinsky.
Stratton entered upon no cross-ex
amination. He informed his callers
what his instructions from Washington
were, and thp officials very agreeably

PR. PIERCFS REMEDIES.
Do yoa remember the little things that
pave ns so mnch pleasure when we were
youaz ? With what zest did we sit down to
the table after onr play was over anÂ« eat the
Tsush and milk onr mother pnt before us.
But as we get older it takes more to give
vi pleasure. Mush and milk no longer
tastes good to us. and onr digestion may be
impaired. The best advice we can give to
euch a person is to tone up the stomach with
pr. Pierce 's Golden Medical Discovery. It
is nature's most valuable and health-giving
a^ent â made without the use of alcohol. It
contains roots, herbs end barks, and is the
concentration of nature's vitality as found
ia the fields and woods. This remedy has
a bistory which speaks well fcr it because
it was given to the trjblic by Dr. R. V.
Pierre, founder of the" Invalids"' Hotel and
Surgical Institute, at Buffalo, N. Y., nearly
forty years ajjo, and has since been sold by
crufcgists in ever increasing quantities.
Some medicines, tonics or compounds, en-
joy a krjre sale for a few years, then disap-
Wrai from the public attention, but Dr.
Pierce 's Golden Medical Discovery has
preyed such a reliable blood remedy and
tonic thit it often enjoys the confidence of
several fjer-eraticrs in a family, and its in-
creased sale? year by year coming from the
leconracndatiors cf thofe vrho have tried
:t, prove its 'las'.ing :aerit. fo that evÂ«;ry
bottle btars the stamp of ncblic approval.
Every other b'oofl-maker and tonic for the
etomach that tve izr.ovr cf contains alcohol,
but Dr. Pierce guarantees that no alcohol
it contained in Li> Â« UÂ«liaJ JJiscoverj." m

The granting of the writ has been
taken under advisement by Judge
Ellsworth. The Judge said he was
uncertain whether to issue a tempo
rary injunction or an order to show
cause, citing the .crematory people to
come before him and show what has
been done. It is acknowledged that
it is another move made ~bn the. part
of those who opposed the establish
ment of a crematory in that part of
the city. A petition for an injunction
to stop the building of the works was
denied them, the five Superior Judges
sitting in bank holding that the cre
matory could not be declared a nuis
ance until it had been' put in opera
tion. The' allegations made in the
present' complaint cover" the point

Neither of the fires did much damage
to the house. In the first instance the
cries of the baby awakened the parents.
Logan found the flames â¢ breaking out
in a closet and quickly extinguished
them. At the second blaze the firemen
prevented the flames from spreading
out of the room in which the. lamp ex
ploded. ;

cover, though her injuries are severe

Spattered with blazing oil from a
kerosene lamp that had exploded while
she was heating curling irons this
morning, â¢ Mrs. William Logan, wife of
an "extra man" in the Oakland Fire
Department, had a' battle to save her
own life and that of her baby, 2 years
old. The scene of the accident was at
the Logan home, 609 East Fifteenth
street. The fire at 7 o'clock this morn
ing was the second one at the house
within forty-eight hours. The first one,
caused by a defective flue, occurred at
12:30 o'clock yesterday morning. â¢' â¢ *
The lamp exploded while Mrs. Logan
was standing near it In an attempt' to
throw the broken vessel out of the win
dow the wtfman was enveloped"-in the
flaring fluid. She tried .to smother the
fire, and succeeded in a measure. Then,
thinking of the danger her baby might
be in, she ran to a bedroom, seized the
infant and rushed out of the house,
screaming for help. Her husbanff, who
was at work across the street, was
among the first to respond. The
smoldering garments were quickly re
moved and the \urned woman was
taken to a neighbor's, where Dr. W. J.
Wllcox attended her. Mrs. Logan's
face, arms and hands were badly
burned.

The bond campaign committee has
established permanent headquarters at
the rooms cf the Oakland Board of
Trade, where literature relating to 'the
bonds can be obtained at all times.
At the close of the address by Secre
tary Stearns the members of the club
voted to use every effort to insure the
Euccess of the proposed bond issue.
The bond campaign committee of the
Progress Federation, of which H. B.
Belden is chairman, has begun active
work in the fight for bonds and already
two bond rallies have been arranged
for this week. The firet of these will be
held in Cameron Hall In East Oakland
next Wednesday evening. Father Yorke
will deliver the principal address. The
second rally will be held at Alcatraz
Hall on Friday evening, September 16.
Colonel John P. Irish will deliver 'the
address of the evening and addresses
will also be made by the Rev. Father
McXally and Aaron Burntrager. Father
McKally has announced that he is vig
orously in favor of the proposed bond
issue. . ; ~_> V- -*
And I believe that the ladies, both the mem
bers cf thÂ« Women's Civic Improvement Club
and others, can, if they trill, render the most
v&iuabl* aid to the campaign committee in its
work.
After a description of the various
emaller parks included in the list of
proposed improvements, Stearns gave
an account of the natural beauty and
accessibility of the proposed "Central
Paris/' which includes what is now
known as Trestle Glen. He pointed
out how by means of the boulevard al
ready constructed on the east side of
Lake Merritt and the one cow in course
ct construction across the Adams
property, an elegant drive could be
built around Lake Merritt, which
would communtcate with the Willows,
th* proposed Water Park and Central
Park. Continuing, Steams said:
I flo not believe that there Is a lady in this
fc.udlir.--e vbo has not. every time she passed

the records which contain all the history of the
citjr? Every one of these records is locked up
In this ramshackle fire trap. If for no other
reaswn except to provide for the eafety of these
records, every citizen cf Oakland should be In
duced to vota fcr the bonds.

held this afternoon at the Chabot Ob
servatory the members were addressed
by Edwin Stearna, secretary of the

a Btrocg argument in favor of the

Mr. Alexander was born Isixty-seven
years ago in the Hawaiian Islands. In
his young manhood he became inter
estedin the sugar industry and in time
amassed a large fortune. Many years
ago the firm of Alexander & Baldwin
was formed and it has stood among the
largest interests concerned In the mld-
Paciflc sugar trade. Thirty years ago
the Alexanders established their resi
dence tn Oakland. The family home
at Sixteenth and Filbert streets is one
of the best known 'in this city. Mr. Al
exander was quiet In all of his tastes.
He was active in the affairs of the
First Congregational Church and his
philanthropy was wfde and generous.
The surviving members of the fami
ly are the wife and four children. The
wedding of Wallace Alexander, the only
sen, and Miss Mary Barker, was one of
the . important society events of this
season in Oakland. .
The Home . Club tea which was to
have been given Friday for a kinder
garten benefit,, has been postponed be
cause of Mr. Alexander's death.. 'He
was one of Its contributing patrons.
S. T. Alexander, . a member of the
Hawaiian sugar plantation firm of Al
exander & Baldwin, a pioneer in the
development of the Sandwich Islands,
and one of* Oakland's leading citizens,
is dead at Victoria Falls, an the Zam
besi River, Africa. The news has been
cabled to his family in this city. The
cause of death was shock following the
amputation of one of Mr. Alexander's
feet, which had been badly crushed by
a rock falling on it.
Miss Anna Alexander was with her
father at his "death bed. Interment
will take place at Victoria Falls. Last
January Mr. Alexander, whose health
was failing, began a tour of the world
with his. daughter. Until the unexpect
ed news of his death was received,
members of the family had heard noth
ing but the most encouraging reports
from the invalid! The father and
daughter had expected to remain away
a year or more. /'"'Â¦ I

County Surveyor Prather said: "It
is stated in the complaint that no ad
vertisement was published to non-con
senting land owners. This was, not
necessary, as there were none, t The
new road will be much shorter than
the old. one and a great improvement."
Thelbids for building the road were
opened this morning a,nd it was found
that the E. B. and A. L. Stone Com
pany offered to do the work for $48.-
S95; the Hansome Construction Com
pany for $47,900, and W. J. Schmidt
for $43,000. The bid was awarded to
Schmidt andthortly afterward the ob
jections were filed with the County
Clerk and presented to Judge Ogden,
who issued the writ asked for.
Supervisor Horner and County Sur
veyor Prather say that the charges
are not well founded. In speaking of
the matter Horner said: "There is
something . back of this more than
mere anxiety for the dear public. The
road has been before the board for
more than a year. All the right of
way has been acquired and this morn-
Ing the board let the contract to build
the road to W..J. Schmidt for $43,000.
It will be of great benefit to the en
tire county. Mines of great value are
to be devoloped and the product will
be manufactured here in Oakland." .
An effort to stop the building of a
road from IJvermore to the . magme
slte mines in the hills twelve, miles
away by the Board of Supervisors has
been made by Harry N. Morse, inde
pendent candidate for Supervisor. He
applied to-day for a writ of Review,
which was granted by Judge F. B.
Ogrden, who has cited the board to
appear before him September 23, al
legrations having been made that the
proceedings had not been regular and
attacking generally the expediency of
such a road.

A religious movement which is in ef
fect a reaction against the scholastic
character of thought In life In Prot
estant Germany is making itself vig
orously felt there and has. become the
leading practical church problem of the
empire. The new movement Is to all
Intents and purposes a pietistlc agita
tion and Is directed against the type
of theology that prevails in the univer
sities and. the pulpits. It is a protest
of the heart against the head and is,
accordingly, one of the ever recurring
reactions which take place in church
history. It is largely a movement, of
the laity, who seem to find their pas
tors with more university learning and
critical and- exegetical ingenuity than
piety. . The " prejudice "against the
church and its pastors has extended so
far that in some circles pastors are
prohibited from membership or partici
pation in the meetings of the associa
tions. These are largely controlled by
younger men and are characterized by a
remarkable religious enthusiasm. ; j

John Conway had a hard luck story
to tell to Dr. Boskowitz at 3 o'clock
yesterday morning when he appeared
at the Emergency Hospital for repairs.
Conway attended a little social party
at his sister's home on Natoma street.
There was a select assemblage there
and there was steam beer somewhere
In the Immediate neighborhood. It
worked up the party to a fighting pitch.
In the excitement John received a knife
Jab over the right eyebrow, which he
desired dressed. He started for the
Emergency Hospital, but mistook the
entrance and went up a stairway lead-
Ing to no particular place, when he fell
and broke his left leg. He is now
stretched on a cot in the hospital won
dering how it all happened.

Young Lloyd was disinherited and
made an attempt in San Francisco to
break his father's will, but was un
successful. When he was asked
to-day why he chose such a peculiar
manner for the performance of the
marriage ceremony he offered no. ex
planation. From all appearances it was
so arranged for the sake of the sensa
tion and notoriety it would occasion.
During his trials young Lloyd and
Margaret Boxall were his valiant
champions, the woman even testifying
that improper relations existed between
the aged capitalist and herself, and
this was given by the defense as 'one
of the reasons for the shooting.
Capitalist Lloyd died soon after the
shooting while on a trip to Japan, it
being alleged, from the wounds inflicted
by Boxall. Boxall was tried twice for
the shooting of his uncle and both
times the jury disagreed. He finally
pleaded guilty to assault and was fined
$400. which he paid into the treasury
of San Bernardino County on Septem
ber 2.
Fred W. Lloyd, a son of the million
aire, and Margaret Boxall, sister of
William Boxall, were united in mar
riage \vhile out on the launch Blanche
in San Pedro Bay by Judge J. V. Â«
Goodrich of this city. ,
Special Dispatch to Tbe Call
SAN* PEDRO, Sept. 12.â Another
strange chapter was closed here this
afternoon in the famous case of the
shooting of Millionaire Charles R.
Lloyd at San Bernardino " about two
years ago by William Boxall, his
nephew.
The trouble had its inception before
the breakfast hour, when, the younpr
murderer declares, his father struck
his mother. Hal* an hour later the
br-y secured his father's revolver.went
to a saloon, drank a glass of liquor
and. repairing to his father's harness
Ftore. reproached him. When the un
suspecting parent turned away the
boy shot him in the vitals and fired
again into his body as he fell. He dis
charged the third shot as the father
lay expiring. The boy then went home
r.nd told his mother and irent from
there to the police station, where he
surrendered.
STOCKTON, Sept. 12. â Fired by re
sentment at his father for what he
declared was ill treatment of his
mother and fortified in his murderous
desire by his first drink of whisky,
Harry Duckland, a 15-year-old lad,
to-day shot and instantly killed his
father. L. H. Buckland. a well known
and highly respected citizen.
The newly organized Sunset Repub
lican Club of tb,e Thirty-ninth District
held a meeting last night at Library
Hall, I street, between Tenth and
Eleventh avenues, and elected the
following officers: James A. Ruther
ford, president; Frank Cornyn, first
vice president: W. H. Mitchell, second
vice president; C. H. Fouther, secre
tary, and Hermann Morris, treasurer.
The Board of Civil Service Commis
sioners met last night at its rooms in
the City Hall. Beyond the regular
routine work the board approved the
temporary appointment of Thomas
Vaughn as street sweeper. The board
disapproved of the appointment of Dep
uty Register S. M. Wilson, iwho Is not
a civil service appointee, arid therefore
ineligible. In Wilson's place the com
missioner:; recommended John F.
Welsh as the next in line on the eligible
list.
J. P. Burke was awarded the contract
for erecting the election booths, his bid
being $13 99 each and $2 50 for inside
fittings.
John Hughes was appointed carpen
ter at the warehouse of the Department
of Elections at a salary of J4 50 a day,
and S. M. Wilson was appointed clerk
for thirty days at a salary of $100.
-The Republican Congressional con
vention of the Fourth District will
meet In Pioneer Hall Thursday evening
of next week. The party leaders are
discussing the availability and fitness
of several well-known aspirants for
Congressional honor. The local nomi
nating convention of the Republican
party will assemble in the same hall on
Monday evening, September 26. Thomas
Atkinson, secretary of the Republican
County Committee, engaged the hall
yesterday.
The Democratic local convention, of
which J. C. Sims is chairman, will
meet again some time next week, and
there are indications that the ticket for
legislative and judicial nominees will
be put forward without delay or un
usual strife. Predictions are made that
Murasky, Seawell, Jenks and White
will be nominated for the Superior
bench.
Anxious to control the appointment
of the Democratic quota of officers to
serve at the next general election, the
Democratic County Committee, through
Attorney Louis H. Mooser, protested
last evening at a meeting of the Elec
tion Commissioners against the ap
proval of a list of some 2000 names sub
mitted by Commissioner Voorsanger.
Mooser contended that' the county
committee had' a right under the law
to submit its list and that the same
must be given precedence by the board.
The board contends, however, that
though the county committees have the
right to submit names for appointment,
it is optional with the board to accept
or reject the same'as it sees fit. The
Voorsanger list was approved by the
board, notwithstanding Mooser's pro
test, though the list presented by him
on behalf of the county committee was
placed-on file for future consideration.
The board authorized the appoint
ment of thirty deputy registrars to
serve for thirty days at salaries not to
exceed $100 a month. It also author
ized the hire of eighteen vehicles to be
used in facilitating precinct registra
tion.

Secretary Shaw -admitted the entire
delegation iin Congress from the arid
States favored irrigation for more than
a decade and many bills were intro
duced looking to the reclamation of
arid lands. These men, he said, would
have been retired to private life had
they not done their utmost for irriga
tion. It was different with the Repre
sentatives from humid , Statesâ none
were willing to risk their political for
tune by an aggressive espousal of irri
gation. -When President Roosevelt
submitted his message to Congress in
December. 1901, conditions changed. " v
"That message gives Theodore Roose
velt the distinction of being the first
to risk his own political fortunes
espousing the cause of irrigation," said
Secretary Shaw. "With absolute jus
tice to every man who has ever lifted
voice or pen in behalf of national irri
gation, history will credit Theodore
Roosevelt with what has thus far been
accomplished and it will mention no
other name as a rival."
DENVER, Sept. 12.â Secretary of the
Treasury Leslie M. Shaw addressed a

ELECTION COMMISSION
Among the first reports were, those
from some of the manufacturing cenr
ters. The cities of Saco, Biddeford, Au
burn, Waterville, Rockland and Lewis
ten gave their returns very early, and
the figures indicating Democratic gains
grew steadily. Later, however, when
the towns began to be heard from a
decrease was noted, and by the time
150 of the 522 cities, towns and'planta
tions had been tabulated there was a
net gain in favor of the Republicans.
With the receipt of 200 towns, how
ever, the Democrats began to make up
lost ground, the totals showing a small
Republican net loss. /
Both candidates were successful in
their own cities. Cobb carried Rock
land by 367, Mayor Cyrus W. Davis, the
Democratic candidate, winning his own
city by thirty-eight votes.
At 11 o'clock to-night Governor. John
F. Hill sent telegrams to President
Roosevelt and Chairman Cortelyou of
the Republican National Committee
claiming thd State by 30,000, the four
Congressmen by majorities ranging
from 5000 to 10,000, every member of the
State Senate and five-sixths of the
House.
PORTLAND, Me., Sept. 12.â The Re
publicans carried the State in the bien
nial election to-day, returns up to 11
o'clock to-night indicating, a plurality
of about 33,000 for .William Cobb, the
Republican candidate for Governor,
compared with 33,384 for Hill, the^party
candidate four years ago.
In the First and Second Congression
al districts the. returns indicate the
election of Amos L. Allen and Charles
Littlefleld by about the same plurality
as four years ago. In the Third Dis
trict E. C. Burleigh ran ahead of his
vote of four years ego. .
At a late hour to-night very few re
ports had been received 'from the
Fourth District, where the re-election
of Llewellyn Powers is conceded. -
Early returns show that the Demo
crats have probably made slight gains
in both branches of the Legislature,
but that body will remain strongly Re
publican and probably will re-elect
United States Senator Eugene Hale.

tini of Vancouver, Wash., shot and se
riously wounded Edward Wollman of
Chehal^s, Wash., in a hop yard here
this morning. Martini jumped on a
bicycle and escaped toward Portland.
Wollman will recover unless blood
poisoning begins in the two wounds,
one in the chest and another through
the left hand. The shots were flred
at so close a range that his skin is
badly powder burned.
As near as can be learned Martin!
became enraged at something his- son
had done and, tying him to a fence,
was beating him unmercifully when
Wollman interfered. The preacher
ordered him away and the men
clinched. In the melee Martini shot
Wollman. Search is being made for
Martini without success. He was not
liked in the hop yards and had been
told to leave. Both he 'and the boy
had come from. "Vancouver to pick
hops in the Herron yard. The bicy
cle upon which Martini escaped was
not his own.

MAY SEEK A SEPARATION |
INSTEAD OF A DIVORCE
Phipps Case Is Discussed by Attorneys
Representing the Millionaire
and His Wife,
DENVER. Sept. 12. â A conference
between the attorneys representing
both parties to the divorce suit of
Lawrence C. Phipps, the Pijttsburg
multi-millionaire, was held to-day.
Mrs. Phipps was present, but so far
as the public has been able to learn
Phipps, although in the city, did not
attend the meeting. However, his at
torney made a proposition to settle
out of court the trouble beween hus
band and wife, but just what the basis
of the proposed settlement is cannot
be learned. It is stated on authority,
however, that Mrs. Phipps asked un
til to-morrow to consider the proposi
tion, which request was granted.
Mrs. Phipps is required by law to
answer her husband's suit some time
to-morrow, if she desires to answer at
all. Should she fail the suit will go
to trial.
A reported feature of the husband's
settlement proposal is withdrawal . of
his suit for divorce and substitution
of an action for separation.

A dispatch received here yesterday
announces that President Diaz of
Mexico has granted a pardon to Ra
fael de "Zayaa Enriquez, former Con
sul-General at this , port. Enriquez
was recalled to Mexico eight months
ago and placed under arrest on a
charge of having embezzled $3000 of
the funds of the local Mexican Con
sulate. He was tried and convicted
and sentenced to five years in a Mex
ican prison, where he has been con
fined for several months.
The friends of the disgraced diplo
mat, who remembered him as one of
Mexico's prominent lawyers and fore
most statesmen of a few years ago,
recently undertook to secure his free
dom. They finally succeeded in mak
ing grood his shortages and reimburs
ing the Government for the expense it
had incurred in trying him.
Former Mexican Consul-General at
This Port Has Been Pardoned
by President Diaz.

The fourth, and what proved to be
the deciding set, was the longest and
best ever played in a championship
tournament in the "West. The final
score was 15 â 13 in MacGavin's favor.
As Ions as tennis is played hereabouts
this set will be remembered and dis
cussed. For excitement and excellent
play it has never been equaled here.
MacGavin won the first two games, but
Bell -took the next two. MacGavin won
the fifth game and led at 3â 2. In the
seventh game, when the score stood
3â3, MacGavin was serving and led at
30â0. By clever placing Bell won four
straight points and the game. The next
game also went to the ex-champion,
giving him a lead of 5â3. With this
lead it looked as if Bell would make it
sets all. MacGavin, however, did some
beautiful playing and in the next two
games lost but one point. MacGavin
also won the next game, but Bell
evened matters up in the twelfth game.
From 5â5 until the end of the set first
one player was in the lead and then the
other, until the spectators were hardly
able to keep their seats. MacGavin
broke in on Bell's service in the fif
teenth game, which gave him a lead of
8 â 7. Bell evened up matters by taking
the next game. MacGavin led at &â 8,
10â9 and 11â10, but Bell was strong on
service and each time evened up the
score.
With the score 12â11 and 40â15 in
Bell's favor" and his service, it looked
like the set would go to him. MacGavin
again showed his nerve and won four
clean aces and the game. In the next
game MacGavin led at 40â15, but Bell
pulled the game out. The score read
deuce five times in this game.
In the twenty-seventh game Bell led
at 40 â 0, but MacGavin by means of his
peculiar service took the next four
joints and the game. In the twenty
eighth and last game Bell won the first
point, but MacGavin took four straight
and ended the greatest set ever played
on the coast.
MacGavin did not play as well as he
did on Saturday, but proved that he is
the greatest player on the coast. He
also proved another thingâ that he is
as good a sport as ever played the
game. He offered to give up his lead
of two sets and start the match all
over, but the committee would not
have it. Bell would have given him a
close rub had the whole match been
played to-day, but MacGavin was play
ing a game that Bell cannot beat. The
new champion certainly deserves his
victory.
MacGavin will be banqueted at the
end of the week.
. MacGavin won two sets Saturday aft
ernoon, and play was resumed from
this point. As was expected. Bell played
much better yesterday, and even with
his lead of two sets MacGavin had a
close call.
The first set played this morning was
taken rather easily by Bell. The score
was 6â2. MacGavin did not play as
well in this set as he did on Saturday.
The tennis championship of the coast
after being held by a southern player
for two years has again come north-
Yesterday on the San Rafael courts J.
Drummond MacGavin, the crack player
of the California Tennis" Club, wrested
the title from Alfonzo Bell of Los An
geles.
Under the StatÂ» law thÂ« Board <rf Educa
tion has no power to refuse adznlttaace of
Japanese and Chinese to tha schools. la my
opinion, however, the practice of haTinar raixva
classes of white* and Mongolians Is bad. WÂ»
have the power to segregate them from, thÂ«
white children and would do so at ence but
for the fact that the Board of Supervisors has
provided no money for tha purchase cr equip
ment of a separate school bulldias- The law
provides that there shall be a, separate school,
but the Board of Education, while realizing
its duty and Us responsibility, can do nothing
If tfte Supervisors do not give us the money.
We have applied to the Supervisors several
times for needed repairs, but have been ig
nored; we have asked for fire escapes on
schools- as ordered by law. but have received
no money to erect them. Should a catastrophe
occur such as the Iroquois fire horror tha
blame cf mismanagement ought not to fall
upon the Board of Education.
President Roncovieri is preparing an
amendment to submit to the Supervis
ors to obtain money for the erection of
a building for housing the Japanese.
In his opinion a school of mixed Japa
nese and Chinese will not succeed,' but
whether a large building for the use of
both Chinese and Japanese will be de
cided upon or two schools will be pro
vided for each branch of the Mongolian
race will be decided by the board.
President Roncovieri said yesterday:
In anticipation of the withdrawal of
Japanese from the public schools of the
city and segregating them in one build
ing to be provided for that purpose.
President Roncovieri of the Board of
Education has been having lists of the
number of Japanese pupils In each
school nfade out and filed at the office of
the Board of Education. The Clement
School, at Geary and Joaes streets,
seems to have the greatest number of
Japanese pupils. This is reasonably
accounted for by its proximity to that
part of town where gTeat numbers of
the Japanese are employed as domestio
servants.

CHICAGO, Sept. 12.â Delagoa and
McGee furnished a hair-raising finish
in the third race at Hawthorne to r day.
The two hooked up at the final six
teenth pole and raced as a team to the
wire, where the Hildreth mare gained
the verdict by the margin of a no'd.
Incidentally the talent and the heavy
speculators were given a scare, as
Delagoa was nearly backed off the
boards, being pounded from 7 to 5 to
13 to 20 and was still being played at
post time. McGee and Delagoa opened
equal choices at 7 to 5, but a flood of
money went in on the latter and Mc-
Gee drifted to 11 to 5, with few takers.
The feature of the card was the Ex
celsior stakes, at one and an eighth
miles, in which Miss Crawford was
favorite. Prince Silverwings, backed
from 6 to 1 down to 4 to 1, ran away
with the race, which was worth $1655
to the winner. Prince Silverwings had
speed to loan â¢ and, taking a lead of
three and a half lengths the first six
furlongs, increased it to four in the
stretch. Although tiring at the- end,
he lasted long enough to win by. a
length.
The track was fast and the weather
clear and cool. The attendance was
only fair, having fallen off largely since
the middle of the season. Summary:

Newport News, Va., July 22, 1903.
Last summer while recovering from ill-
ness of fever, I had a severe attack of
Inflammatory Rheumatism v\ the knees,
from which I was unable to leave my
room for several months. I was treated
by two doctors and also tried different
kinds of linaments and medicines which
seemed to relieve me from pain for
awhile, but at the same time I was not
any nearer getting well. One day while
reading a paper I saw an advertisement
of S. S- S. for Rheumatism. I decided
to give it a trial, which I did at once
After I had taken three bottles I felt a
great deal better, and I still continued
to take it regularly until I was entirely
cured. I now feel better than for years
and I cheerfully recommend S S S. to
any one suffering from Rheumatism

An important feature of the State Publicity
Committee's work will be its advertising in
Eastern publications. This advertising will be
Â¦o directed as to get the names of thousands
of those who are interested in California 'and
who w!ah more Information. California will be
advertlatd in every prominent publication, so
that every reader In the United States and
many parts of the world; cannot fall to know
that ho con get reliable information on Cali
fornia by writlnc for It. The inquiries from
people Interested in California that are de
rived Irom such advertising will be far greater
than the aggregate of Inquiries that are now
derived from advertising all sections indi
vidually. Every part Â« of th* State will not
only receive more settlers, manufactories and
a yreater demand for their goods, but will b*
benefited by th* Increase of | population and
the promotion of industries In the State. In
short. Hie object or the State Publicity Com
mittee !s to carry out a plan of comprehensive
advertising to make the development . work
more effective. '
The State Publicity Committee,
which was formed as the result of a
conference at Sacramento of execu
tive officers of development associa
tions of California, has issued its
first bulletin, in which the history of
the formation of the committee is re
viewed. The purpose of the commit
tee Is declared to be to centralize pub
licity work for the entire State and to
unify that work and effectively ad
vertise California: also to bring to va
rious sections the manufactories and
Industries that they need. A part of
the bulletin .referring to the plan or
work is as follows:
The object of the State Publicity Committee
is to conduct an active campaign looking to
the advertising of California's products and
the bringing of desirable settlers and needed
industries and manufactories to the State.
Offices will be established by the State Pub
licity Committee in Chicago and New York,
where literature on all sections of California
will be distributed. This means that all or
ganizations of the State will have an efficient
medium for the distribution of literature. These
offices will be in charge of competent persons
who will, in addition to the distribution of
literature on all parts of California, make, an
especial endeavor to exploit California products
and broaden the market for same, and to en
courago desirable manufactures upon the Pa
cific Coast.

BARK BIG BONANZA. WHICH NEARLY ENDED HER VOYAGE FROM -ALASKA ON THE ROCKS NEAR POINT REYES. SHE
LET GO BOTH ANCHORS. WHICH HELD HER FROM THE BEACH UNTIL THE ARRIVAL OF THE TUG DEFIANCE,
WHICH BROUGHT HER TO PORT. L Â¦ ,
The old timer was there. , He didn't
bring Willie for an excuse either. He
was honest and. simply said he wanted
to smell the saw dust and be young
again.
"I remember "when I wanted to run
away and follow a circus. It wasn't
much of a circus, but It was more than
Uho 'Arabian Nights' to me. I miss
something here."
The old fellow looked wistfully but
sadly at the girls in Floradora picture
hats, the girls in knee breeches and
girls in every sort of modern stage
dress. Suddenly there burst into one
of the rings a white horse, bearing a
girl in the ballet costume of other days.
It was a pink gauzy thing, that stood
out stiffly away from the damsel's
knees. On her forehead was a glitter
ing star of up-to-date diamonds.
The circus fan of days gone by
chuckled and gaped like a, visitor from
the egg raising dlstriot. "That's her.
That's the real circus lady. Without
her it's no circus. I saw her when I
was a kid and had to split wood to get
to the show. By Jove, maybe that's
the same one!" So, even the old timer
was happy.
In the morning Ringling's Theater
paraded in full force* The animals
went two by two, just as they walked
out of -the 1 ark up- on Mount Ararat.
There were nearly as many of them,
too.
Most side shows have been what the
wise youth would call "de bunk," but
the giant and the Singhalese pigmy,
and all the impossibilities promised by
Ringling's spielers are there.
The old circus was as stereotyped as
the minstrel show. Now come female
ringmasters in ballroom cloaks, tricks
that never were heard of- in the old
days when one ring, some lemonade
and a bag of peanuts with "La Clar
it>e" Â¦ breaking hoops In the one ring,
made a circus. Â¦Â¦ .
Ringling Brothers' circus is up-to
date in everything and three laps
nhead in some things,* There are brand
new clown i gags, as good vaudeville
turns as ever made the Orpheum crazy
on Sunday night and animals that
could do anything but talk Russian.
Never was so much given away for
four bits. No one but a cross-eyed man
could see it all and he .would have to
moVe his optics to ragtime music to
take it in. There were three rings and
two stages. While one was watching
the seals juggle firebrands he missed
the white horse that did a cake walk.
While he gave all hjs attention to the
pink silk tights whirling in midair he
missed the trained elephant with the
gold fillings | in his tusks, who turned
sommersaults. . * '
In nattiness and neatness the Ring
ling Brothers' show Is almost too much
up to the times. The circuses of the
days "when you and I were young"
are doomed. One can see it in the
Floradora costumes of these modern
"queens of the ring," in the new
stunts of the clowns and, in the vau
deville aspect of the bill.
Old-Time Fan Looks for the
Lady in, Ballet Costume
Whom He Cut Wood to See
The bark Big Bonanza, which arrived late
â¢Funday nJpfct, I Will IT J nTlTll days from Xusha
iak. nearly wrnt ashore Sunday near Point
Reyes. She was close in sh'cre when the wind
Â«Jit-<i and or.ly the fact that both anchors found
rood holding ground tared the vessel from
bttn^ twept adhere by the current. The Big
;. Â¦ .:-.zu'x predicament iras seen by the life
saving crew at Point Reyei? and the local tow
both companies were notified. The Spreckels tug
DeSance started Immediately for the scene,
gulled the Bie Bonanza out of danger and
towed her into port. She brought 31, IK) cases
of Kalmon.
The Pacific Mall Company's liner Ko
rea, Captain Seabury, which narrowly
escaped capture on her outward voyage
by Russia's Vladivostok squadron, ar
rived yesterday from the Orient. She
left this port ten days behind her sched
ule and arrived here only two days late,
having made up eight days during her
two months' absence.
It was a thick haze that saved the
Korea from the Russian warships. For
two days, July Â£S and 29, she must
have at times been within gunshot of
the squadron that was looking for her,
and had she been captured the contra
band cargo in hrr hold would have in
sured her detention if not confiscation.
There was joy in- Yokohama when the
big liner emerged from the fog sur
rounding that port. Japanese officials
climbed the Korea's bridge, and as they
noisily inhaled the eea air to show their
pleasure bowed low to lucky "Bill" Sea
bury, to whom the elements had been
as kind In providing the convenient
mist as were the gods of old to their
favorite mortals.
On the return trip between Shanghai
and Nagasaki the Korea encountered a
typhoon, but after trying vainly to
Shake up the massive liner the storm
â¢whirled itself to another part of the
sea.
The Korea brought a large number
of passengers and C741 toiiB of freight.
Her cargo included 21,950 chests of tea
and 1600 bales of raw silk. The silk is
valued at 51.2CO.000. She also brought
1,000,000 Japanese gold yen. Her pas

UP to the closing of the Registrar's office on Saturday night last
there had been recorded but 56,315 names of voters desiring to
exercise the prerogative of the franchise in the coming national
election. According to the officials in the office the great register
should contain 80,000 entries when its covers are finally closed on
September 28, yet there are 23,000 citizens that have still neglected to
qualify for the highest privilege their rights command.
But a week and a slight margin over remain before the laggards
in registration will be deprived of the right to cast a ballot' in No
vember. On September 14 and 15 books will be opened at precinct
registration places, thereby accommodating thosÂ« who feel it too
irksome to make a trip to'the City Hall. Besides this opportunity
of registering, to be offered in 320 booths throughout the city, addi
tional facilities will henceforth be presented the hurried business
iv.zn by the Registrar, who announces that from now until the close
of registration his office will be open from 7:30 to 9:30 o'clock in the
evenings.
It is not* so much to the party man as "to. the citizen of every
party that the injunction to register is made. Besides the issue. o'f
the Presidency there are candidates for Congressional honors and
local questions of charter amendments to come. before the will of
the people. Viewed from party standards, a vote missed is; a vote
for the other side: in the light of the duties of citizenship the right
of franchise neglected entails by just so much a negative influence in
government. As citizen primarily, as party man likewise, let every
man see to it that his name is on the great register before the 28th
of the month. '

H. G. Wells isn't going to lose any
thing as the result of his recent trou
ble with the executors of the late
George Gissing. GIssIng's two little

because of it. The'thing Is especially
unfortunate for the reason that Gis
sing left little or nothing, in consider
ation of which fact. It may be remem
bered, his children recently were
granted a small pension from the civil
list. H. G. Wells was one of Glssing's
best friends and soon after the latter's
death Welis? Offered to write an intro
duction to Gissing's posthumous novel,
"Veranilda." which is a romance of
the Byzantine empire. The offer was
gladly accepted by Algernon Glssing
and Miss Collett, GIssIng's executors,
especially ft as a London publisher was
prepared to pay quite a decent price
for the novel on the strength of the
"foreword." When the introduction
was submitted, however, though it
had been highly approved by several
of Gfscing's friends, It did not at all
please the novelist's executors. They
refused, in fact, to have it Incorporat
ed in the book. , Wells, for his part,
declined to alter what he had writ

allowed to, people from all over the
country having been writing to him
concerning it. The question as to
whether this animal, in dying, com

is still being discussed in the news

was announced that the Psychical
Research Society intended to investi
gate the matter. Meanwhile the author
of "She" in a letter to the Times de
clares that the many letters he has
received seem to prove almost beyond
question that telepathic intercourse
does exist between man and horses,
dogs, cats, and even birdB. But by far
the most interesting part of Mr. Hag
gard's second letter is n. theory which;
he puts forth as to the possibility that
the same sort of soul exists in both
human beings and animals. . "What is
there," he asks, "to show that man has
reached finality in his knowledge of
such wonders? Surely the daily, in
creasing store of science indicates that
revelation is progressive' and continu
ous. May we not still have muchTto
learn as to the fundamental oneness
of animal life, or, indeed, of all life?. A

THE PRESIDENT'S LETTER.
[X a republic there must be parlies and there must "be a variety of
political opinions. This necessity naturally develops two leading
parties, -landing in opposition to" each other. But these normally
-Mould be divided i by permanently held opinions! .They cannot be,
-afch- for the interests of the country, divided by one simply object*
; .v.Z to whatever the other -docs, for that is mere opportunism. When
by standing for a mere negation a victory is won by an opportunist
party the result means nothing, for the people do not know what
policy will talce the place of that which is retired. The Democracy
i^ a party now of .mere negation. It has no policy permanent and
ir-critorious to urge upon the country, but stands objecting to the
permanent principles of Republicanism and lo the policies rooted
therein. . . . .
I 'resident Roosevelt in his letter of acceptance puts the case
exactly in saying: "It is difficult to find out from the utterances of
our opponents what arc the real issues upon which they propose to
wage this campaign, It is not unfair to say thai, having abandoned
most of the principles upon which they have insisted during the last
eight years, they now seem to be at a loss, both as to what it is
they really believe and as to how firmly they shall assert their be
lief in anything. In fact, it is doubtful if they venture resolutely to
press a single issue; as soon a> they raise one they shrink from it
and seek to explain it away. Such an attitude i> the inevitable re
sult of the effort to improvise convictions, for when thus improvised
it is natural that they should be licit) in a tentative manner." \ . ...
The Democracy in 1S96 and 1900 abandoned, deserted and re
pudiated all of the principles it had advocated and the policies it had
pressed in all of its history up to. that time. It turned its back upon
ihe one overshadowing issue that it had steadfastly held since Jef
icrson's time, that of sound money. Its adherence to that issue under
all circumstances up to 2856 had secured for it the confidence of the
business classes of the country. Though it was perverted after the
rise of Greenbackism. >Ir. Cleveland attempted lo bring it back to
a firm position on that issue, and it turned and rended him. When
this occurred it proceeded to repudiate its one special principle and
to substitute for it the Bryan issues, which, beginning with unsound
money, naturally radiated from that vicious center of attacks upon
the courts, the constitution, the right of contract and upon every safe
guard of personal and of property rights. Now it comes, saying
nothing about the new issues of the last eight years, refusing to re
turn to the long held principles which those issues repudiated, and
simply presenting itself, an amorphous mass of opposition, relying
for success solely upon personal attacks upon President Roosevelt.
The President speaks out with entire frankness for himself and
his party in describing such an abnormal condition of politics. He
des-cribes the situation so exactly that all men, friends and foes,
recognize its justice. After citing the acts of the administration to
which public objection is made, and making that description not a
defense^ but an attack, he turns from the overt to the covert phase
of the fight, saying: "In addition to those acts of the administration
which they venture to assail only after misrepresenting them, there
are cithers which thev dare- not overtlv or officiallv attack and vet
which they covertly bring forward as reasons for the overthrow of
the party. In certain great centers and with certain great interests
our opponents make every effort to show that the settlement of
the anthracite coa! strike by the individual act of the President and
the successful suit against the Northern Securities Company â the
merger suit â undertaken by the Department of Justice, were acts for
which the present administration should be thrown out of power.
Yet they dare not openly condemn either act. They dare not in any
authoritative or formal manner say that in either case wrong was
done or error committed in the method of action or in choice of the
instruments for putting that action into effect. But what they dare
not manfully assert in open day they seek to use furtively and
through special agents. It is perhaps natural that an attack so con
ducted should be made sometimes on the ground that too much,
sometimes on the ground that too little, has been'Mone. Some of
our opponents complain because, under the anti-trust and interstate
commerce laws, suits were undertaken which were successful; others
because suits were not undertaken which would have been " un
successful." ' '.' t* â¢
That is just, truthful and frank and discloses the exact, position
of the Democracy, a position which no good citizen is willing to de
fend openly.
But the body blow by the President at the party and David B.
Hill, its manager, the inventor of Judge Parker, is hit in the next
sentence: "The Democratic State Convention of New York dealt
with the anthracite coal 'Strike by demanding, in deliberate and for
mal fashion, that the national Government should take possession
of the coal fields, yet champions of that convention's cause now con
demn the fact that there was any action by the President at all.
though they must know that it was only this action by the President
which prevented the movement for the national ownership of the
coal fields from gaining what might well have been an- irresistible
impulse."
We invite sustained attention to that paragraph of the letter.
Mr. Hill wrote that expropriation plank of the New York platform.
K the coal strike had continued his candidate for Governor, who
stood on it, would have been elected. Then does any one doubt that
the present Democratic national platform would have declared
the main issue to be the right of governmental expropriation of pri
vate property whenever its* owners were denied its use by the
presence of a superior physical force ?
The President, as an individual, settled the strike, and public
exasperation, relied on by Mr. Hill, rapidly evaporated, and so we
escaped in our politics an issue based upon the declaration that pri
vate property is robbery.
The whole letter is vigorous, a charge from beginning to end,
and appeals to all Americans who believe in their country.
In future battleships none other than
armor-piercing guns are likely^to con
stitute the main batteries and British
naval designers are seriously consider
ing the idea of the Italian chief con
structor. Cunlberti. to have the main
batteries composed of 12-lnch guns
solely. Italy, as usual, was the first In
thus improving the fighting efficiency
c-f battleships by discarding suna of
8-inch and less caliber and substituting
guns o* 8-inch caliber, the penetrative
power of which is about 5.67Â» inches of
Krupp armor at a range of 5000 yards.
Four battleships, the Vittorio Eman
uele III. Napoli, Regina Elena and
Roma, of 12.425 tons and a calculated
speed of 22 knots, have been laid down
for the Italian navy since September.
1901, and two of these are nearly ready
for commission. The main battery of
these ships is composed of two 12-lnch
and twelve 8-inch guns and the sec
ondary batteries consist of twelve H
pounders and twelve S-jounders. Their
hull protection varies from 9% inches
to 4 inches erf armor and that of the
gun" positions from 8 inches to 6 inches,
so that neither the hull nor gun posi
tions would be seriously hurt by the
fire from guns of less than 8-lnch cali
ber at 2000 yards range. Sacrifices
have undoubtedly been "made In order
to attain the great speed of 22 knots
and the advantage of guns that are
effective even beyond three miles
range, but the vessel that can choose
its distance from an enemy and can
shoot farther and hit harder than its
opponent would .seep to have decided
advantages over the slower vessels, the
guns of which are ineffective at very
long range.
The Vickers 6-inch gun of 50 calibers
and a muzzle velocity of 3220 feet is
said to be the best gui^ of its caliber
in any navy and its penetration is fig
ured at 534 inches of Krupp steel at*
3000 yards. United States naval ord
nance, of 6-Inch and 50 calibers, claims
a velocity of only 2900 feet and a pene
tration of 4.24 inches of Krupp steel at
3000 yards. The actual performance of
both guns Is subject to a reduction in
practice, in which our naval gun will
suffer more than the other. The Bu
reau of Ordnance, on February 8 last.
issued orders reducing its velocity to
2700 foot seconds, which, of course,
diminishes its penetrative power.
Main Object of Guns.
The main object of guns is to disable
ths enemy by destroying his gun posi
tions, guns and crew. It is only by
mere chance that a well directed shot
could destroy a ship. Holes made by
either 12-inch or 4-inch rhell can be
stopped and fighting still be earned on.
When it is considered, however, that
the penetrative power of a 6-inch gun
is less than 3 inches at 5000 yards, while
that of the 8-inch i3 5.67 inches, the 9.2
inch 9 inches and that of the 12-toch
over 12& inches, it appears worse than
useless to carry guns incapable of de
molishing gun positions of 6 inches to
10 inches at ranges from 3000 to 5000
yards. In the latest American battle
ships of the Connecticut type, of which
five are building and two are shortly
to be begun, the 6-Inch gun has. been
eliminated and the main batteries con
sist cf four 12-inch, eight 8-inch and
twelve 7- Inch guns. The latter gun will
penetrate AYz Inches of Krupp steel at
5000 yards and may be considered as a
compromise. In the British navy the
eight battleships of the King Edward
VII type laid down since 1302, the 6
inch gun is still carried, the batteries
including four 12-inch, four 9.2-lnch
and ten 6-inch, but in the Lord Nelson
class, to be built, the armament will
consist cf four 12-inch, ten 9.2-Inch and
a number of small guns to repel tor
pedo-boat attacks. A similar re
arrangement of armament in armored
cruisers and other vessels is certain
to follow, resulting In somewhat sim
plifying designs' of ships, which for the
past ten years have been hampered by
vain efforts to give each class con
glomerate batteries regardless of their
logical destination as fighters.
Twelve-Inch Gnn Cracks.
The unpleasant discovery has been
made that one of the twelve-Inch guns
on board the British battleship Ex
mouth has a cracked tube. This is the
first Instance of its kind with modern
guns and a thorough investigation is
to be 'made to ascertain If there are
other guns similarly affected.
An unseemly row has been raised
between the naval officers of the New
York Navy Yard owing to their in
ability to agree on the invitations to be
issued to witness the launching of the
battleship Connecticut on September
2S. An allowance of $1500 had been
made by the Navy Department for the
entertainment of 600 people and a
stand 200 feet in length was built at a
cost of $400 to accommodate the in
vited guests', which some of the officers
intended to include chiefly prominent
naval officials and their families. A
dispute arose, however, over the as
signment of seats and the argument
became so noisy that it reached Wash
ington, resulting in an order from the
Navy Department directing the erec
tion of a smaller stand, large enough
to hold those directly interested in the
launching, together with the official
guests. The stand already built was
demolished and the bickering ' officers
will have to. take their chances with
ordinary citizens admitted to the yard
to witness the ceremonies.
This trouble at the New York Xavy
Yard is not so surprising after all. .It
has for its basis that everlasting and
ever occurring squabble of precedence,
this Jealousy of line and staff preroga
tives, fancied or real, and In the com
plement "of fifteen line officers and
twenty-one staff officers attached to
the yard there are quite a number
whose ideas of naval precedence vary
greatly with those of their opponants
and who lack tact and tolerance. The
commandant of the yard. Rear Ad
miral Frederick Rodgers, unofficially
known throughout the. navy aÂ« "Turk
Rodgers," or "Bucko Rodger*." is
somewhat of the Robley D. Evans type
of line officer and possesses none of
the qualities or his uncle, the late
Kear Admiral C. R. P. Rodgers. whose
sobriquet, that of "Chesterfield Rod
gers," Indicated hia tact and considera
tion .for others, even if they were not
line officers. Joseph N. Hemphill. cap
tain of .the yard, is also a firm expon
ent of the line officers* pre-eminence
and, as some of the aUff officers are
now ready to discuss the subject it is
not surprising that internecine war
breaks out over apparent trifles, but
which really engrosses more attention
than the building up of the navy.

an instructor in that institution. Dar
ing his long career he' has always been
held. in the highest-esteem. At present
he'is stationed'at Redwood City, which
will probably be his last'eharge. ' :

the Young Men's 'Christian Association

A distressing case of Fibroid Tumor,
which baffled the skill of Boston doctors.
Mrs. Hayes, of Boston, Mss., in;
the following letter tefis how :;she was
cured, after everything else failed, by
Lydia R Pinfeham^s Vegetable G>mppuncL
Mrs. Hayes' First Letter Appealing to Mrs. Pinkham for Help :
"Deas Mrs. Pks'khaji: â I have been under Boston doctors' treat-
ment for a long time without any relief. They. tell me I have a fibroid
tumor." I cannot sit down without great pain, arid the soreness extends
up my gpine. I have bearing-down pains both back and front. ' My ab-
domen is swollen, and I have had flowing spells for thre"e years.?,* My ap-
petite is not good. I cannot walk or be on my feet for any lengtn'of time.
"The symptoms of Fibroid Tumor given in your littfe book ac- .
curately describe my case, so I write to you for advice.?â (Signed) Mrs.
E. F. Hayxs, 232 Dudley St, (Roxbury) Mass.
Note the result of Mrs. Pinkham's adviceâ al-
though she advised Mrs. Hayes, of Boston, to^ take
her medicine â which she knew would help her â
her letter contained a mass of additional instruc-
tions as to treatment, all of which helped to bring
about the happy result.
"Dear Mrs. Pinkham: â Sometime ago I wrote to you describ-
ing my symptoms and asked your advice. You replied, and I followed
all your directions carefully, and to-day I am a well woman.
tt Tha use of Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound entirely
expelled tho tumor and strengthened my whole system. I can walk
miles now.
" Lydia E. Pinkham*s Vegetable Compound is worth five dol-
lars a drop. I advise all women who are afflicted with tumors or
female trouble of any kind to- give it a faithful triaL"â (Signed) Mrs.
E. F. Hates, 252 Dudley St, (Roxbury) Boston, Mass.
Mountains of grold could not purchase such testimony â or take
the place of the health and happiness which Lydia E. Pinkham's
Vegetable Compound brought to Mrs. Hayes.
Such testimony should be accepted by all women as convincing
evidence that Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound stands
without a peer as a remedy for all the distressing ills of women; all
ovarian troubles; tumors; inflammations; ulceration, falling and dis-
placements of the womb; backache; irregular, suppressed or painful
menstruation. Sorely the volume and character of the testimonial let- â¢
ters we are daily printing in the newspapers can leavia ino room for doubt
Mrs. Hayes at her above address will gladly answer any letters
which sick women may write for fuller information about her illness.
Her gratitude to Mrs. Pinkham and Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable
Compound is so genuine and heartfelt that she thinks no trouble is too
great for her to take in return for her health and happiness.
Truly is it said that it is L ydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Com-
pound that is curing so many women, and no other medicine ; don't for-
get this when some druggist wants to sell you something else.
Â£ C fi ff (I FORFEIT^ vÂ« eaceot forthwith produce the original letters and rigaatum Â©I
Ay Â» | j j [ Â§ Â»tÂ»Â« testimonial*, which will prove their absolute renuineoeM. <

BUTTE. Ijiont., Sept. 12. â Five
masked men held up and robbed the
saloon of George Cooper on East Tal

secured $114 in cash. B. Cummings
was hit on the head with a gun and
suffered a severe scalp wound. He was
the bartender. >j.
Three of the men entered the saloon

NEW YORK, , Sept 12. â Enraged
because he had been censured for
keeping late hours, Edward Dennis, 17
years old, shot his grandfather, F. H.
Melser, with whom he lived at New
Springfield, Staten Island. The lad
then turned the pistol iJn hlfnself and
inflicted a wound which probably will
cause his death. The grandfather's
wound Is not serious.
Youth Resents Censure by His Grand
father and Attempts Murder
and Suicide.
TAKES SHOT AT RELATIVE
AND THEX AT HIMSELF
NEW YORK, Sept. 12.â According to
a statement published to-day by the
American, an expert criminologist has
made startling discoveries connected
with the finding, in April last, near
Hempstead, Long Island, of a body
which was buried by the authorities
under the name of Martha Laimbeer.
Circumstances then pointed to the sup
position that the woman killed herself.
Her beauty and evident refinement
lent interest to the case, increased by a
letter which the authorities received
containing a $100 bill "to save the poor
woman from a suicide's grave."
It is stated by the American that the
expert made discoveries which satisfied
him that the woman was murdered
with a blow on the forehead by her
husband while the two were quarreling
In a carriage; that, aided by a friend,
he took her body to the spot where it
was found, more than ten miles dis
tant, and after arranging her clothing
In a theatrical manner, poured car
bolic acid into the mouth and thus
hoped â¢ to create the impression that
she had committed suicide. For the
same purpose the husband wrote the
5100 letter giving the name of Martha
Laimbeer to the dead and asking that
the money be used for. the purpose
stated.
The criminologist also declares that
the murderer later killed in a perfectly
similar manner another woman in
Chester, Pa., with all the accessories
used in the first murder, the second
woman having been his sweetheart to
whom he Is believed to have confided
the story of the first murder.
Then followed the reports of dele
gates from each nation of the progress
of the cause of peace in their respec
tive countries, which concluded the
day's work.
It is not necessary to believe that all of
the wishes and all the dearest and completest
ideals of those who hope for universal peace
and unlversat disarmament may be realized.
Still, as the saying Is, "Nothing Is impossible."
and. while tt<8 way seems long and the diffi
culties almost insuperable, yet by hard and
sensible work and earnest and prayerful
striving you may so animate, inspire and up
lift those who follow you that the latter may
have the glorious fate to dwell in the time
when â
"The war drums throb no longer and the
battle flags are furled."
ST. LOUIS, Sept. 12.â The one hun
dred and twentieth conference of the
Inter-Parliamentary Union opened to
day In Festival Hall, at the World's
Fair grounds. Two hundred and twen
ty-six legislators from England and
practically every European Parliament
were in attendance to discuss questions
the solution of which by this confer
ence may have a worldwide sig
nificance. There also was an American
group, headed by Congressmen Richard
D. Bartholdt of St. Louis and T. Bur
ton of Cleveland.
In accepting the office of president
Congressman Bartholdt dwelt at length
upon the purposes of the, conference,
and expressed the opinion that its work
would finally result in the attainment
of universal arbitration and universal
peace.
Francis B. Loomis, First Assistant
Secretary of State, who represented
President Roosevelt, spoke in part as
follows:
I am clad to welcome the delegates and
members of the Inter-Parliamentary Union to
this city and to this country. The Govern
ment of the United States and Us people are
pleased to have you ' here. The President of
the United States authorizes me to extend to
you his kindest and most cordial greetings.
Valuing as he does the blessings of peace,
earnestly desiring the diminution and lessen
ing of the rigora and horrors of war. your
coming Is particularly grateful to him. for
you are about to discuss phases of a problem
of deeply human and worldwide interest, the
peaceful settlement of international disputes.
Within the last one hundred years there have
been more than two hundred cases In which
International differences have been adjusted by
the peaceful method of arbitration In one form
or another, and the Government of the United
States has been a party to about seventy of
these arrangements.
I desire to compliment thÂ« Inter-Part la
mentary Union upon the declaration which it
made at its conference held in Holland in
1S94 in favor of a permanent court of arbi
tration and the subsequent development of lta
plans for such a court, prepared by a com
mission of six members appointed for that
purpose. The Inter-Parliamentary Union de
serves credit for practically forecasting five
years in advance what proved to be the most
salient work of the peace conference at the
Hague.
The cause of international arbitration is
making notable and permanent progress. Since
your last meeting. Great Britain and Franc*.
Francn and Italy. Great Britain and Italy.
Holland and Denmark, Great Britain and
Spain, France and Spain, France and Holland.
and Spain and Portugal have concluded
treaties pledging themselves during a period of
five years to submit certain classes of cases
to the Hague tribunal. ThÂ« signing of these
treaties marks a distinct and promising ad
vance.

SUMMARY OF THE MARKETS.
crop of about 620.000,000 buehels, was largely
confirmatory of previous estimates of damage.
It started foreign market' which advanced
sharply. Added to this were reports of frost
In Manitoba, where the wheat is not yet all
harvested, and rains In the Northwest. All
this caused a general covering of shorts and
a rather broad market. Cash markets were
little - uncertain, â¢ but higher, although they
don't follow speculative -advance. . There was
rebuylng by the Northwest and by some of the
local professional trade. We look for a con
tinued active, nervous market, - and. while we
we nothing attractive in the short side, we
naturally are a little conservative about ad
vising purchases except on sharp reactions."
In this market futures did not fully follow
' the Chicago advance, rising only l%c on the
morning session, because the largest operators
were short and bearish and keot the market
down. The cash grain remained unchanged.

1 10',-j. As ..the session advanced a host- of
small buyers came In from the country,-indi
cating apparently that the public at large was
beginning to realize the damage sustained by
the bread-producing cereal. Â¦ Throughout â¢ the
day 'offerings were entirely ' insufficient to the
demand. With no let-up in the buying, prices
were forced higher and higher, until all op
tions had reached a point 4. cents above the
last Quotation on Saturday. Higher prices -in
all outside markets helped to stimulate bullish
enthusiasm here. Reports. of large flour sales
in the Northwest also added strength to .the
situation. The high' point on December waa
scored at $1 12%. which was 4Vite-t$jc abdve
the close on Saturday. Tbe . sensational
strength was maintained up to the last minute
of trading, tlÂ»e market closing almost *ut the
highest price, with December at SI 12%. May
ranged between $1 11 \~ and $1 14% and closed
at ?1 14%. The current month sold bPtweea
$1 07% and $1 00%, closing at the high point.
Liberal receipts and a bearish Government
crop report had a depressing influence on thÂ«
corn market. December opened \-,<U%c higher
af 51 }4c to 51%c and closed at 51%c.
As a result of moderate selling by several of
the bull leaders, sentiment In the oats pit was
somewhat easier. December closing practically
unchanged at 32>Â£c.

was a success. The - play is lavishly
mounted, a snow 1 scene with a sleigh

one feature, while another scene was
that of a big department store, with a
stock of : merchandise and a corps of
clerks. Automobiles play a part in' the
street scenes, and clever specialties are
introduced by â¢ Curtin and Blossom,

is. pleasingly rendered by Verne Castro.

a stranger, who engaged a room last
Sunday night and who did not sign the
register. Frederick Cheney, the por
ter, tried to open the door with a pass
key and found that the keyhole was
stuffed with cotton. He broke a win
dow and gained admittance. The body
of the stranger, fully dressed, was ly
ing on the bed and the key of the gas
burner was open. Nothing was found
in the pockets of the dead man that
might give a clew to his identity. He
v.-as about 45 years old, 5 feet 8 inches
tall, full face, blue eyes, fair com
plexion, brown hair and mustache and
wore a brown sack suit and a white
shirt with black dots. He looked like
a German or Scandinavian.

The testimony from this on involved
small details of the trip through Eu
rope and home. The witness was
weary with the tedious questioning and
wag excused until to-morrow after
r.oon. if she feels able to attend the
conference.
In Paris Miss Dolbeer was not very
v.ell. She had been somewhat weaker
in New Tork than in Fan Francisco. In
the French capital she expressed a
tvish to return home. Doctor Gros. a
famous physician of Paris, was con
sulted and treated the patient for some
days. She did not materially imorove
and decided to return to the United
States. Miss Warren also desired to
return.
Neither Miss Warren nor Miss Dol
beer kept herself aloof from the pas
sengers on the steamer, the witness
testified. They acted as any other pas
sengers would have acted under the
circumstances.
Miss Warren explained that Miss Dol
boer had taken bromides for several
months and had also tried a number
of drugs to ease her nervous sufferings.
The patient was regular in her habits.
retired early and led a very unexcit
able life on shipboard. There was noth
ing remarkable in her bearing or habits
â in fact, she acted perfectly naturally,
but suffered such minor ailments as
the witness recorded.
Regarding the effect of the trip to the
East the witness said that Miss Dol
beer had lost ten pounds in weight
during her stay there. She was not
seriously ill, however, as a result of
the travel. Miss Warren was then ask
ed about the treatment of her compan
ion for indisposition and in explana
tion told of the medicines prescribed
for the patient's insomnia. Miss Dol
beer never used narcotics.
It was nearly 6 o'clock before Sten
ographer George W. Smith had his
notes in such shape as to be able to
give an outline of the proceedings. The
questioning â¢ had been on the subject
cf Miss Warren's relations to the dead
pirl during a trip to New York, Paris
and London. Miss Warren was asked
to describe Miss Dolbeer's personal ap
pearance and replied that she was
"tall, weighed 145 pounds and was con
sidered beautiful. She had brown eyes
and brown hair and was graceful of
movement."
No woman could have been more
calm and self possessed under the run
ning fire of questions put to her by a
brace of lawyers bent upon weaken
ing her evidence than was Miss Etta
Marion Warren, who, by virtue of the
will of Miss Bertha Dolbeer, is heir
to nearly a million of .dollars.
Attorneys Hiram and Albert M.
Johnson used every effort yesterday
to tangle Miss Warren's testimony dur
ing the taking of- her deposition, but
the young woman was direct in her
answers and gave a plain, matter of
fact 6tory of her trip to New York and
Europe with Miss Dolbeer.
Horace D. Pillsbury, attorney for the
executors: Attorney Garret W. Mc-
Enerney for Miss Warren, and Attor
neys Johnson for the contestants, were
in the office of Mr. McEnerney at 2
o'clock in the afternoon, prepared to
continue the examination of the prin
cipal in the case. Miss Warren en
tered shortly after that hour and it
v.as announced that her testimony
would be taken in the presence of the
lawyers and executors only, and after
ward given to the press.
As the Judge has intimated that the
prosecution has made out a prima
facie case it begins to- look as if Hut
ton's conviction is a foregone conclu
sion, now that he has lost his most
important point.
Attorney Johnson saM he was not
ready to proceed with the defense
owing to the absence of his associate.
Attorney- RIordan, through sickness.
He asked for a continuance, which
was opposed by Attorney George D.
Collins, who has;never ceased his ag^
gressive fight against Hutton end his
persistent defense of. his clients.
The Judge said the case would be
peremptorily set for hearing next
Monday, and if Attorney Riordan
could not, be present at that time
Johnson had better get some other at
torney to assist him, if assistance
were necessary. ,
Police Commissioner H. W. Hutton.
"special chief of police for 1129 Du
pont street," lost an important point
yest-lay In the contempt proceed
ings against him for violating the in
junction restraining the police from
interfering with ths restaurant busi
ness of Jean Pon, 1129 Dupont street.
At the last calling of the case Hut
ton's attorneys made the point that as
the only evidence against him was
that of Captain Duke, an accomplice,
Hutton could not be convicted on
Duke's uncorroborated testimony.
Each side was given time to file
briefs on the point and a continuance
was granted till yesterday.
The Judge overruled the point,
holding that even though Duke had
been an accomplice the point could
not be sustained In contempt proceed
ings, because Hutton was not on trial
through an indictment or â¢ informa
tion.
To . begin with the production, it
should be said that the stage tailor has
done his most here. The uniforms
alone are worth the price. Such â¢ a
gorgeousnessof gold braid! Such but
tons! Such a muchness of smartly tail
ored male! These, .with the trim quar
ters â¢ of the swell .military person, the
bugles, the gay incident of army post
life, furnish an atmosphere both pic
turesque and thrilling, and every credit
is due the management here. .
To ' me, who 1 had not been Alcazar
ward this week or so, the appearance of
Miss Eugenie Thais Lawton in the cast
proved most interesting. I have often
wept with Miss Lawton up at the Cen
tral. . Why, what that girl has gone
through! And I have triumphed with
her over the villain with the same
persistent regularity. Last night I saw
her for the first time for a matter of
two years, in a play worthy of her, and
was not disappointed. Miss Lawton has
the charm of a line sincerity, a genuine
feeling for pathos, a truly sympathetic
quality in her work. Four matinees
and i seven evening performances last
week, too, did not prevent this young
woman from giving her lines with en
gaging certainty, which is more than
could . be said of some others in the
castâ even of Mr s Whittlesey. Alto
gether Miss Lawton's Muriel Manner
ing, is a. most. pleasing figure, and not
least as a picture. I was glad to see
again Miss Virginia Brissac as the In
genue^. She is both clever and pretty.
Mr. Whittlesey was winning and
good-natured as Major Bingham, as
Captain Marshall . intended the major
to be, but the stern fiber of the soldier,
is not in him. In the sentimental lapse
of poo'r '"Kit," however, Mr. Whittle
sey is -all there, and Wears his clothes
admirably. Mr. Conness is the major's
successful rival. Colonel Anstruther â
one rather wonders at his success;
Harry Hilliard does an unusually good
bit of work as Walter Mannering. and
Earle Williams contributes another as
Lieutenant Peter Barker. A . large
house applauded vigorously. ""
BLANCHE , PARTINGTON.
A- smart play smartly played Is the
Alcazar's "Second in Command," put
on last evening at the little home thea
ter. The play is one of the three to be
used on. the coming Western tour of
White Whittlesey, and the cast of last
night is almost identical with that
which will appear on the road. Cer
tainly in this instance the road, long
suffering, has -something to look for
ward to. Captain Marshall's clever
play, fortunately introduced here by
John Drew, improves on acquaintance.
Particularly happy is. the dialogue; one
notes. And the story, as military ro
mance goes, is effective arid interesting
throughout.
