WAR IS REMOTE,
THE MIKADO'S
OFFICIALS SAY
TOPEKA. Kans., Jan. 29.â Kansas Is
the storm center for a freight rate war
in grain, and within the next fortnight
it is likely that the State will be thor
oughly drained of the 20.000,000. bushels
of wheat which are supposed to be still
held by the farmers.
The Santa Fe has announced a cut of
5 cents per hundred in the rate on
grain from interior Kansas points to
Galveston by the direct route. This
means j r Jla^ : _jhe grain willing! he sent
around by - \ray. of- Kaunas City, but
will move direct from Kansas over the
Gulf, Colorado and Santa Feto the
gulf port.
It is expected that 'the other roads
will meet the Santa Fe's cut for gulf
business, and the probability is that the
Eastern roads which depend for their
business on the haul to Minneapolis.
Chicago or Eastern ports will make a
cut in the rates to turn some of the
business in that direction, instead of
allowing it to all slip away by the gulf.
In addition to the cut mede by the San
ta Fe, the Rock Island and the Mis
souri Pacific have given notice of a re
duction of " cents in the rates to the
gulf via Kansas City.
The rate war 'affecjjf the grain dis
trict extending from the Dakotas to
Oklahoma, but the reduction of present
rates from interior points does not ex
tend farther south than the Kansas
Slate line on the south. It is thought
that the lines interested will get to
gether within two weeks and adjust
the rate situation. .
As soon as the Indians heard this I
rain of bullets they immediately began j
retreating toward the shore. The gun- j
ners were given express" orders not to
iifjure the Indians, so the bullets cut
the air and churned up the water all
around them. No shots were fired at j
the Bancroft, which at once sailed for |
Colon to bring In the report of the oc
currence.
Last Thursday men from one of the }
Bancroft's boats Insisted upon purchas- i
ing a few cocoanuts from the Indians
and paid more than full value for them, j
Toward 11 o'clock that night, when it !
r.aa dark, twenty canoes "were seen-ap- {
preaching the Bancroft. The gunboat
turned her searchlights on the canoes,
arnd it was revealed that each boat car
ried as many Indians as could crowd
in. probably 200 in all. All the men
were armed with bows and arrows,
guns of quaint old patterns and other
weapons. Their faces were besmeared
with paint. There is no doubt that
their intentions, were hostile. They i
hoped to reach and surprise the ship.
The commander of the Bancroft or- \
dered the gunboat cleared for action, j
and her guns were loaded and trimmed i
ready for use. A quick-firing Colt gun j
was placed near the gangway and or- Â¦
ders were given to the gunners of this j
piece to keep a ceaseless fire all around

PARIS, Jan. 29.â It is understood that
the conferences between Foreign Min
ister Lamsdorf and M. Kurino, the
Japanese Minister at St. Petersburg,
have permitted the latter to advise his
government concerning the position
Russia is likely to take in the forth
coming answer, but the officials here
say this was merely an intermediary
step toward adjusting the remaining
differences, as" the answer is subject
to change unofficially communicated. It
is further said that Russia will not
answer until she feels reasonably as
sured that her. answer will .not have
the effect of precipitating hostilities.
The officials here are gratified at an
apparently authoritatrve statement that
Japan does not intend to fortify the
Straits of Korea. Thfcy say it will- re
move one of the main obstacles, as the
most recent negotiations showed that
Russia was unalterably opposed to the
creation of any condition in Korea
which would lead to closing that outlet
from the Se^a of Japan.
A strong Intimation has been made
that the maritime nations of Europe
and the United States would have
taken up the question unless this
declaration had been made.
RUSS/A WANTS PEACE.

Dies From the Effects of Burns.
AGED PIONEER
DIES AFTER A
SHORT ILLNESS
While the nurse was away from the
ward for a few moments this morning
Swartz returned and obtained Giles*
signature. The nurse returned just in
time to see Swartz taking the pen
from the old man's hand and imme
diately reported to Dr. McAllister.
Swartz was then taken before the
commandant of the home, Colonel
George W. .Walts, to whom the trans
action was related. Swartz refused to
exhibit the paper, which Giles had
signed. He claims that certain min
ing property owned by Giles was as
sessed t and that to relieve Giles from
the assessment he had induced him to
sign a paper. Friends of Giles have
been notified of the transfer of the
property. .
Dr.' McAllister states that Giles is
and has been since his admission to
the hospital of weak mind and totally
incompetent to transact business re
quiring normal intelligence*
YOUNTVILLE, Jan. 29.â The of
ficers of the Veterans' Home at Yount
ville believe that Louis Swartz has
obtained by questionable means the
transfer of valuable mining property
to himself from George W. Giles, a
patient in the hospital. Swartz visited
the hospital Thursday evening, asked
an employe where Giles could be
found and upon ' being shown to the
south ward endeavored to prevail
upon Giles to affix his signature to a
paper conveying certain mining prop
erty rights. The employe to whom
Swartz had spoken reported the mat
ter to Dr. W. F. McAllister, . who im
mediately informed Swartz that Giles
was an incompetent and not qualified
to perform any act relating to the
transfer of property. Swartz then
went away, saying he was disappoint
ed, but that under the circumstances
he did not desire to 'obtain the signa
ture.
When Lum finally dropped back un
conscious the murderous trio dropped
their weapons and fled. Many Chinese
saw them go, but they had disappeared
before the alarm was given. Then Ser
geant Christensen, his squad, Detective
McMahon and Policemen V. N. Baku
lich and J. Amend hurried to the scene.
The injured man was sent to the Re
ceiving Hospital, where it was found
that the cleaver had cut three severe
gashes in his skull and that his right
lung had been punctured twice by the
dagger. There" were also many minor
cuts and bruises.- There is little hope
for the injured man's recovery. The
physicians wonder that he did not die
af once." The crime has caused a wave
of terror to sweep over Chinatown. The
combination of two powerful fighting
organizations against a third insures a
long and obstinate battle, and it is un
derstood that an effort will be made to
crush the Hop Sing tong in this city.
Patrolmen Tillman and Hinrichs raid
ed the premises at 629 Howard street
last night, supposed to be a rendezvous
for highbinders, and placed nine China
men under arrest. They were taken
to the City Prison and placed upon the
detinue book pending an investigation
by the police.
Only a few hours passed before the
,Wa Ting tong exacted vengeance. At
5 o'clock in the afternoon three high
binders made their way fo the top floor
of a three-story building at 754 Wash
ington street, where dwelt one Muck
Lum, ex-actor and prominent in Hop
Sing circles. They forced the door and
surprised their Intended victim as he
lay on an opium bunk with a compan
ion, Chan Dung. The possibility of po
lice scouting about the neighborhood
and cutting off their escape should a
pistol be discharged caused them to
choose other weapons. While one of
the men carried a revolver under his
blouse, the other two were armed with
wicked looking cleavers and daggers.
The smaller of the three men thrust
a revolver in Chan Dung's face while
the other two hired asassins attacked
Muck Lum. Tlje mrfrked man begged
for his life, but while one thug dealt
him blow after blow with the cleaver
his mate wielded a long dagger, plung
ing it downward again and again into
the breast of their. victim.
Three powerful Chinese societies have
clashed in Chinatown, and hostilities
were marked by two tragedies yester
day. Early in the morning a running
fight among highbinders occurred on
the street, in which Thomas Spellman,
a watchman, was accidentally shot
and in turn wounded Ho Yow, the
heathen' who shot him. The Chinese,
disabled and bleeding, was sent to' the
hospital, and his friends late in the
afternoon avenged his injuries by
carving up one of the opposing tong
with a cleaver and a dagger. The lat
ter. Muck Lum, will probably die. j
The trouble between the Sen Suey
â¢Ting Tong and the Hop Sing Tong has
been of long standing. The Wa Ting
Tong then came to the assistance of
the Sen Suey Yings, and one month ago
Jew Chun, a Hop Sing man, attempt
ed to kill Ho Get of the Wa Ting Tong
and was arrested. Some difficulty arose
over the prosecution, and early yester
day morning two members of the Hop
Sing Tong started out to find Ho Yow,
one of their adversaries. Ho was lo
cated in a restaurant on Waverly place,
near Clay street; but when he caught
sight of the highbinders he bolted from
the place and started toward Washing
ton street.
A running fight with pistols follow
ed. Ho was armed, and he fired back
at the men who sent bullets in his di
rection. The chase lasted for some dis
tance, when Watchman Spellman rush
ed toward the trio and received a bul
let in the leg from the revolver in the
hands ' of Ho. Spellman then drew his
own weapon, and a second later the Wa
Ting Tong man staggered and fell to
the ground, shot through the leg. Mean
while, the two Hop Sing men dodged
into a side street and made their escape.
Policeman George Douglass and
Watchman Swift hurried to the scene
and placed Ho Yow under arrest. Both
the injured men were taken to the Har
bor Hospital, where it was found that
'their injuries are" not serious.
The statement that a gang of flve
men has been spotted, which was given
out yesterday from San Francisco,
cannot be confirmed here, and the gen
eral opinion prevails, even among sonvi
of the detectives, that the story was
sent out merely for the purpose Vof
throwing the real culprits off their
guard. ~CAW-'->\ "^-V^w ~ *â¢
Among the detectives here there ap
pears to be a complete difference -- of
opinion. The Pinkerton men have.sus
picion of an old-time resident of this
city, while the railroad detectives are
of the opinion that the letters are the
work of an ex-convict, for they say no
beginner in crime would concoct such
a devilish plot, j Furthermore they as
sert that if the letters were written by
a crank more of them would- have been
mailed. There are many theories and
men appear to be working on all of
them.
Where the detectives have all gone
is not known, but several of ' them
were in Madera to-day. -It- was
from Madera that the last letter was
written. The opinion prevails here
that the would-be blackmailers Â¦ have
associates at Madera, and the work
there may result in some arrests <or
disclosures. â¢ - Â¦ . -
FRESNO. Jan. . 29.â Rumors by the
dozen have been in circulation here to
day regarding the railway blackmail
case, but the greater part of them were
without foundation. There has been
a general movement to some other
quarters by the officers, and to-day
there was less than a third of â¢ the
PInkerton force in Fresno. Detective
J. M. Lake, who is in charge of the
Pinkertons, is still here, however, and
admits that the work is being directed
from here. The men have simply gone
to another field, he says, and their
withdrawal from Fresno was not be
cause the case has been abandoned,
but because it is thought their services
might be of more value somewhere
else.

"When .Russia was at the crates of
Constantinople and practically had dic
tated peace to Turkey, Great Britain
interfered, and the result was the Ber
lin congress. Is there any good reason
why Great Britain should wait for the
conclusion of war to summon a simi
lar council? Would it not be more
statesmanlike and certainly more hu
mane to summon such a council now
in order to prevent war? Would it not
be possible for the Russian Government
to sell its railways in Chinese territory
to an international syndicate, all the
powers guaranteeing the safety and the
interests of this syndicate? In that
way, it seems to us, the real rights of
Russia In Manchuria would be safe
guarded, while the apprehensions en

be permanently removed."

CHICAGO. Jan. 29. â Notwithstand
ing recent experiences with smoke and
tlame tenants of the Masonic Temple,
a twenty-story structure, failed to
scare to-day when a flre broke out In
the Cosmopolitan building adjoining.
The occupants of the Cosmopolitan
made a hasty exit. On the upper sto
ries of the Cosmopolitan a number of
women became hysterical and, blinded
by the smoke, made efforts to spring
from ,the windows. Cooler heads pre
vented this and the women were car
ried down the flre escapes. One girl
was perhaps fatally burned. Chemicals
she was mixing on the sixth floor ex
ploded and caused the fire. The wo
man, in a dying condition, was car
ried down a flre escape by C. W. Ran
dolph, secretary and treasurer of the
Cosmopolitan Light Company. Several
other persons wera burned, but not
seriously. \''.-V-Â»
Edward Stokes, who assisted In the
rescue of Miss Verba, was probably
fatally burned. Of the forty-five peo
ple on the floor where the fire started
twenty-five were women. The panic
started with the explosion of thÂ«
chemicals and the excitement was In
creased when Miss Verba ran from the
room screaming. The girls made a
rush for the door. As they neared the
center of the room the foremost of
them fell and the next moment Tiearly
all of them lay in a heap on the floor
screaming.
Meanwhile Randolph, | with Miss
Verba in his arms, had begun to de
scend the fire ' escape amidst the
cheers of thousands of people who
stood in the street. At the fifth floor,
almost overcome by smoke, Randolph
gave his unconscious burden to
Stokes, who carried the girl to the
street. This duty done. Stokes suc
cumbed to his own injuries and was
taken to the hospital. While this
rescue was being performed the safety
of the , other girls was attended to.

which man. he said that the excited

stand yesterday.
Vose at the Coroner's inquest d*id not

murdered man. Yesterday he stated
(hat he thought the picture of Blaise
that was shown to him resembled
somewhat the excited German he saw

G. H. L. Gregory, general agent for
the Aetna Life Insurance Company, re
lated his transactions with Soeder when
the latter' attempted to take a number
of policies out on the life of Blaise in
that company. Gregory said: .
It waÂ» on December, 14 that Soeder came
to my office and asked me If any one bad been
sent to hts house, . on Jackson street, to see
about the Issuance of some- Insurance policies.
He asked -if any oneVhad called at the Grand
Hotel to see 'about' Insurance on the life of
his brother-in-law, Joseph Blaise. I told him
that we had not Â«ent any one on such an
errand, and asked him if he was staying at
the Grand Hotel. He replied that be was not,
as when ' he arrived !n the city he had been
sick and had gone to a private residence on
Jackson street, but had informed . the New
York office of the company -that he Intended
goin*. there on his arrival in this city.
I bad received a letter from the New. York
All of the testimony given by Miss
Meiers had to be obtained through an
interpreter. Attorney Salomon speaks
German fluently and several times .he
upbraided the interpreter for not giv
ing an exact translation of the
woman's testimony. The two en
gaged in several lengthy disputes over
the meaning of German words and
had to be silenced by the court.
Moritz Meienberg, Miss Meiers' un
cle, testified that Soeder told at the
time of his visit on the day the mur
der was discovered that Soeder and
Blaise had eaten supper together and
that when they left the restaurant
Blaise did not. want to go home, but
went for a walk. Soeder said that
Blaise had $90 on his person at the
time. Meienberg stated that Blaise
always came to his place after supper.
TESTIMONY IS IRRELEVANT.
occasions Blaise came out to her un
cle's place near Ingleslde at night
time. He was at the house for mail
the night before the murder and it
was dark before he left for home.
The police have claimed that Blaise
never left the room which he occu
pied with Soeder alone at night.
Miss Flatley, said she never knew
that Soeder had brought suit to regain
the jewelry that he harf given her.
A recess was taken, and in the after
noon at the resumption of the hearing
Miss Flatley was: cross-examined, by
Attorney Salomon. She admitted that
she had accepted a tailor-made - suit
Miss Flatlev identified the keys and
grip as belonging to Soeder. The police
found the keys in the possession of
Soeder at the time of his arrest. Miss
Flatley wrote a, letter to Soeder, as she
had been'dlrected by the police, and re
quested him toremove his trunk, from
her cellar. She said that she had never
seen Soeder since his return to this city
and had never spoken to him since his
departure for Germany. The poison
in the- other bottles referred to was the
hydrocyanic acid found in. the .grip by
the police. ,
Miss Flatley denied that she had ever
taken a gentleman's watch from Soeder
on a trip to Mount Tamalpais. The
prosecution alleges and will attempt to
prove that Soeder pawned his jewelry
and everything of value .he had to get
enough money to pay the premiums on
the insurance policies that he took out
on the life of Blaise. Assistant District
Attorney Hanley says that Soeder was
broke at the time of his arrival in this
city and had to pawn his watch and
chain. If this be true, where did Soeder
gtt the wad of greenbacks that were
seen in his possession by the agents of
the Paciflc Mutual Life Insur
ance Company at the time of
their visit to " â¢ his room, when
the 'applications for policies, were
written ? - This is a question yet' to be
solved. The prosecution alleges that on
December 16, ,the day that Soeder paid
for the policies.; he. pawned his jewelry
to make the payment He certainly' did
not get much money on his watchâ at
least not enough to pay for insurance
policies. . .

Coroner's Jury Can
Find No Name for
Murderer of Blaise
Soeder was in San Francisco for two
weeks before he let Miss Flatley know
of the fact. On December 26 he wrote
and told her he was sick and would
like to see her. He asked that she
visit his room on Jackson street. "I
will have to wait till April now ( to get
that," the letter read, referring to the
legacy. "I have a gentleman friend
with me from Germany, who has been
nursing me, and he wants to return to
his home. I feel ashamed of this for
not getting my" money right away."
The rest of the epistle was composed
of loving terms and the writer im
plored the young lady to come to his
room and see him. t
The prosecution alleges that Soeder
wanted Miss Flatley to call at his
room so that he might take from her
the jewelry he had given her. She
never went, however, and three days
later Soeder jwrote again. The letter
bore an angry tone and Soeder said in
it that the engagement between him
self and Miss Flatley was broken.' A
portion of the letter reads as follows:
"Let the engagement be broken and I
will never see you again, but you must
return all presents to you from me. I
will send for them, and if you do >not
return them to me I will get them;by
force, and . then you will : see a little
fun, or trouble, as some folks call' it."
The other letter was written on the
same paper, and Attorney Hanley
called attention to the similarity be
tween the stationery used in the two
letters. The letter was written, the
pqpsecutiori claims, at the same time
and on ,the same steamer stationery
as the previous one. The ship emblem
was torn from the stationery used in
this letter. It is alleged that Soeder
sent this letter to his home In Germany
and .had his mother remail it to Miss
Flatley. This he did, it is alleged, so
that Miss Flatley might think he was
still in Germany. The letter stated that
Soeder would have to wait two months
longer to get the money, owing to some
court difficulties, and bore the post
mark of "Hub, Konton Pflasburg, Ger
many,"
IMPLORES WOMAN TO WRITE.
The theory of the prosecution as to
Soeder's purpose in writing letters on
the steamer when on his -way home
and sending them back to Germany
from N*ew York, to be remailed, is
that he wished to keep from Miss Flat-
Iey t the fact of his arrival in this city
until he could secure sufficient money
to bear out his legacy story.
In every letter Soeder implore'cl the
woman to write him, but she scorned
him completely. The last letters writ
ten by Soeder to the woman he pro
fessed to love were penned in this city
after he arrived from Germany with
Blaise.
Two other letters, one written in
Avicourt, Lorraine, on November
3, were received by Miss Flatley.
The letter of November 3 was written
by Soeder and told of his visit at home.
The letter was written on the station
ery of a steamer of a French trans-
Atlantic liner. It was signed "Leon
Soeder, Paris French."
sorry that he had been compelled to
telegraph for money. He told a long
and detailed story of iiaving been
robbed in Rochester. The. police claim
that Soeder never had any money, but
that he wanted Miss Flatley to believe
he was about to get a large sum of
money from an estate in Germany.
They say that he was in lcve with the
woman, and thought that the securing
of a large sum of money would act as
an inducement for her to marry him.
He intended to get insurance money
on the death of his brother-in-law,
Blaise, say the police.
Annie Meiers, one of the young
women who met Soeder and Blaise on
board the ship coming from Germany,
testified that he told her he had paid
Blaise's passage and always paid for
everything the two got. Attorney Sal
omon objected. He was overruled,
Judge Cabaniss stating that had he
been sitting as a trial -Judge
there was a great mass of the testi-^
mony produced by the prosecution*
that he would have excluded. "If the
case ever goes to a jury," . said he,
"the prosecution will have, trouble in
untangling the, mass of evidence they
â¢have produced at this hearing."
Miss Meiers' testimony did not dif
fer materially from that already pub
lished. She said Soeder visited her
uncle's place at 4.S0O -Mission street
twice on the day the murdered body
of Blaise was discovered, once at 8:30
in the morning .and again at 6:30 in
the evening. On his second visit he
brought two evening papers and
showed her and her uncle an account
of the death of Blaise. He seemed to
be sorry, she said, at least he express
ed his sorrow. Moritz Meienberg gave
him a letter on the second visit. He
did not seem disposed to read it and
Miss Meiers asked him to read it, as
she thought it might contain . some
news of Blaise. Soeder did not want
to open it and finally tore the envel
ope open after examining it before
the light. In it were three sealed and
stamped letters, which Soeder shoved
in his pocket. He then tore the outer
envelope up and threw the scraps on
the sidewalk, where they were after
ward . picked up by? the police and
placed together. Miss Meiers Identi
fied the envelope as having been the
one that Soeder received on that day.
Hanley asked that the letter be en
tered as 'evidence and Attorney Salo-'
mon objected. Judge Cabaniss upheld
the objection. ,
WRITES LETTER TO HIMSELF.
Attorney Hanley said they intended
to show that the letter had been writ
ten by Soeder to .himself, in an en
deavor to proye an alibi. It was post
ed on the night of the murder, lie
said,' and received at the sub-postofnee
Station T>, at 5 o'clock on the morning
that .tfie-\ ; murder, .. was . discovered.
Theodore I^jftka has identified th.e en
velope as Hiving . been written in the
hand of -Soeder. "
Miss Meiers Â¦ said she had seen the
gray 'suit' of /Soeder worn by him
while he was on the.: ship. The de
fense gained a point on the testimony
of Miss Meiers. She said that on two
on having revenge.
Miss -Flatley was* dismissed and the
Coroner's deputy promptly took her. in
charge and conveyed her to the inquest
room at the Morgue.
Attorney Salomon questioned her in
regard to her having roomed with Soe
der all night. /At this suggestion the
young woman rose part way from her
chair, trembled with rage and vigor
ously denied the question. While Salo
mon was, examining Miss Flatley,
Soeder sat next him and dictated the
questions. It was plain that Soeder
was bent on smircHing the character
of the young woman, who he claimed
had jilted him. He was aware that Miss
Flatley, among all the witnesses, had
given the police the most damaging tes
timony against him, and seemed bent
from Soeder, although she was not en
gaged to him. When asked whether
Soeder had not made her a present of
some money and a hat. Miss Flatley
blushed deeply and emphatically denied
that she had been the recipient of any
such presents.
CORONER TAKES WITNESS.

sey has completed an autopsy on the
body of James Hoy, who was found
dead near the depot at Yountville
Wednesday night. He refuses to make
known the result of the autopsy, but
ifis considered significant that after a
consultation with Coroner R. 21. Kyser
he telephoned to Sheriff Dunlap and
District Attorney Benjamin, who im
mediately drove to Yountville and con
ducted an investigation. The officials
refuse to discuss the case. Their ac

SEEKING DELEGATES
Democrats of every faction in the
State concede that Gavin McN'ab has
a good nose for a political Moses, and
he mny come home with tidings from
the East that a new Moses has been
found to lead the children of Dem
ocracy to the White House. There will
he talk enough durinc McXab's ab
sence, but nothfng will be done until
he Returns. '
It if current gossip in Democratic
â¢ircles that James V. Coleman, who is
nrator and angel, too, will not go to St.
Lqui$ as a delegate to the national con
'vefition unless he is permitted to freely
expraSi there his preferences in regard
to aspirants for the Presidential nom
ination, fie will not go to the oonven
vntion Hill bound or Hearst bound or
even tied up to Olney or Parker. N'o
one can foretell what will happen in St.
Louis when the Democratic leaders get
together. The second place on the ticket
may bo given to some Rifted orator
from California.
McXAB STILL LIVES.
"We will know more about it when
O^avin McNab comes home." That was
the gist of a reply made by a well
known Democratic leader to the ques
tion, "Will the State convention of
Democrats instruct for Hearst?" In the
wigwam of the Iroquois the chieftains
say that the delegates from California
to the national Democratic pow-wow
at St. Louis next July will not be in
structed for Hearst, but they will agree
to support him provided he can de
velop any strength outside of the dele
gation from this State. The Iroquois
braves from many villages in the
Golden State will assemble in San
Francisco on George Washington's
birthday, and then opinions as to the
advisability of booming Hearst will be
expressed.
Gavin McNab's word is not law in
the council of the Iroquois, and in the
M^nticello Club the worshipers at the
McN'ab shrine are not legion, because
the MrXab resignation is inscribed on
the records of the club. Yet withal the
handy way McN'ab has of manipulat-
Insr a convention of California's Demo
crats is yet an object lesson in the
school of the unterrified. It is presum
ed that McNab will exchange â¢ confi
dences with Olney. that he will listen
to David B. Hill, size up the mysterious
Parker and make his own estimate of
Tammany's power in the St. Louis con
vention.
Judge Cabaniss admitted- the letters.
They were in a loving tone. In one.
dated October 24, Soeder said he was
Prosecuting Attorney Hanley stated
that it was the purpose of the prosecu
tion to prove by the letters that Soeder
was without money and that with the
$100 that he got from Miss Flatley he
procured passage to Germany, 'as he
needed what money he had to pay pre
miums on insurance policies. Hanley
said that the jewelry that Soeder
claimed to have robbed of in
Rochester was pawned here in this city
at Liechtenstein's loan office by the de
fendant Soeder.
LETTERS ARE INTRODUCED.
Miss Flatley said she sent Soeder the
money. The prosecution then began to
introduce all of the letters written to
Miss Flatley by Soeder while he was
on his way to and from Germany. At
torney Salomon
The telegram follows: C'
NEW YOUK. Oct. 23, 1003.
MIm Catherine Flatley, 251 Marshall street:
Send me $100 by telegraph. Am too late for
eteamer. Lost all money.
LEOX SOEDER,
West Shore Hotel, New York.
The telegram sent by Soeder on his
arrival in New York was offered in
evidence by the prosecution. Attorney
Salomon objected, but Judge Cabaniss
overruled the objection a"nd stated that
should the prosecution fail to show the
relevancy of all such evidence he
would strike it out. .
Did he epeak of his wealth often?
Y*Â«, he spoke of It all the time. He spake
of it as soon as he returned from Alaska in
September and even mentioned what he was
to iet.
When did you hear from him first after he
left San Francisco for Germany?
When he telegraj^ied frcm New Torlc for
Yes. lie said that he had considerable
money loft him In Germany. He told me he
would ret $10, 000, In Germany and would get
more money later on.
I met Soedpr in the latter part of March.
!'j< .::. ' He called at the house often until the
ISth' of April, when* he left for Alaska. He
returned again September 15. He came to
our house e-very other day until he went to
Cit-rmany. He save me some jewelry, a, pair
or diamond earrinc*.' a diamond ring, a. pearl
Ineastpln and a watch and chain, valued at
*:J15 in all.
Attorney Hanley â Did Soeder ever tell you
of his wealth?
Only once was her anger aroused.
Attorney Salomon 1 asked her if she had
ever received any money or had ever
stopped over night with Soeder. She
became indignant and emphatically
denied that she had.
Her testimony was as follows:
Mis? Flatley was the main witness
for the police. She stated that just be
fore Soeder left this city to go to Ger
many he told her he expected to come
into an estate of $10,v>00, and that he
was going ihere to collect it.. He told
her he expected considerable other
money in a short time. When Soeder
arrived in New York from this city on
his way to Germany he immediately
telegraphed to Miss Flatley, to whom
he claimed he was engaged, for $100.
Miss Flatley sent the money, and the
police aver that this sum was used by
Soeder to assist in procuring passage
to Germany for Soeder and the return
passage with his brother-in-law. Soeder
wrote to Miss Flatley and explained
why he had written for the money. He
said he had been robbed of all his Jew
elry and money in Rochester, X. Y.,
and was penniless.
Witness first mot Soeder in March of
last year. She was introduced to him
by her father, who had worked with
him as a cook and had known him
since hÂ« was a young man.
Miss Flatley took the stand with a
brave air. She Is a pretty brunette,
with an imposing form. She seemed
not to dread her Cjmbarrassing position.
She related without a blush the receipt
of jewelry- from Soeder, and admitted
that he had also given her a suit, but
denied that she had ever taken any
money from him.
MISS FLATLKY'S STORY.
The Judge said he thought that when
a woman had been on the stand for two
hours she should be shown considera
tion. While the Judge was thus en
deavoring to distract the deputy's at
tention. Miss Flatley slipped from the
courtroom. Her escape was. noted by
McCormick, who told the Judge that he
would see him some other time, and
hurried to get his witness. Miss Flat
ley was angered at being called on to
testify in two places on the same day.
CASK AGAINST SOEDER WEAK.
The police have a weak case against
Soeder. The evidence thus far has
merely tended to show motive for the
crime and the bad character of Soeder,
the crime itself not having yet been
probod.
Judge Cabaniss has been lenient
in admitting a mass of -apparently ir
relevant testimony, expecting that t,he
prosecution will connect it with perti
nent evidence later.
The police did not live up to their
agreement, and Deputy Coroner Mc-
Cormick had difficulty in getting his
witnesses together. He made repeated
trips to Judge Cabaniss" court and
compelled witnesses to go to the in
quest. He complained that the police
had hidden several of the Barbary
Coast witnesses. When the police had
finished with Miss Flatley, Deputy
Coroner McCormick subpenaed her.
Judge Cabaniss was displeased, and he
asked Deputy McCormick whether she
could not be allowed to go. McCormick
said that Coroner Leland wanted the
witness at once.
The Coroner's jury yesterday re
turned a vcrd'.ct in the Blaise murder
case. It was that Joseph Blaise came
to a violent death at the hands of a
party or of parties pnknown.
The inquest and the Police Court
hearing were continued yesterday
morning. The police, fearing that
Coroner Leland would carry out his
threat and use his power to compel the
witnesses in the case to appear before
him, among them some of the police
force working on the murder case, told
the Coroner that they would exchange
witnesses during the day, so that, both
the inquest and the hearing might
go on.
Dr. Bacigalupi. rutopsy surgeon^ to
the Coroner, described the wounds' on
Blaise's body, and said that the fatal
wound must have been caused by a
sharp instrument, while the others
might have been inflicted with a stone,
club or other fclunt weapon.
Theresa King, Soeder's dance hall ac
quaintance, was too ill to appear, and
her testimony was taken in her room.
She fixed the dates of meeting Soeder
and stated that the last time she had
seen him was at about 10 o'clock on
the night of the murder.
At the afternoon session Miss Cather
ine Flatley was first called. She seem
ed to enjoy being on the Uand, and re
told tu3 tale of her friendship with
Soeder. the breaking off of their rela
tions and the robbery of Soeder's trunk
in the cellar of her house. She describ
ed him as what the girls, vFbuld call "a
good thing," as he wr.s always liberal.
The testimony was largely a re
capitulation of what has already been
told In the columns of the press and
brought out in the preliminary Police
Court hearing. The only new witness
was L. R. Parker, agent for the Hart
ford Life Insurance Company. He told
about a visit, he made with Osborne
of the Pacific Life to Blaise at 827
Jackson street and of the conversation
regarding the insurance on Blaise's
life. Blaise on that occasion informed
his visitors that his wife in Germany
would pay the premiums. Soeder had
represented to them that Blaise was a
chef in the culinary art. and when the
witness, speaking in German, asked
him about it, Blaise laughed and said
he was not a chef, but just a plain, or
dinary cook. The visitors left after
Blaise had signed his name to the ap
plication for the policy and made an
appointment for Blaise and Soeder to
call at the witness' office on Saturday
morning, this conversation having
taken place on the Friday preceding
the murder. On Monday morning fol
lowing the witness found a card writ
ten in blue pencil signed by Blaise, but
not in his handwriting, stating that the
writer would call on Monday morning
at 11 o'clock or at^ in the afternoon
of the same day. The application was
sent East on the Saturday before the
murder, but the policy was never is
sued, nor was any money or note de
posited on it.
JLt the morning session J. W. Fowler,
the insurance agent, testified as to first
writing the policies in behalf of Blaise's
wife and afterward substituting the
name of Leon Soeder.
Sergeant Christiansen told of the
finding .of the body on the morning
afler the- murder, and Mrs. Christian
sen told of having heard screams at
the time the murder is supposed to have
occurred.

The long drawn out inquest into the
death of Joseph Blaise came to a close
a few minutes before 6 o'clock last
night, when the Coroner's jury brought
in a verdict to the effect that deceased
had met a violent death at the hands
of some party or parties unknown to
the jury. Coroner Leland approved the
verdict, stating that in the face of the
evidence he could hardly see how any
other conclusion could be reached by
the. jurors. The verdict was as follows:
PORTLAND, Or., Jan. 29.â The the
ory that the destruction of the Park
street public school at midnight la?t
night was the act of an incendiary 13
given credence by the police and
fir*? departments. The police were told
to-day that shortly before the flames
broke out a tall woman attired in black
was seen descending the sstep3 of. the
schoolhcuse to the street. She appeared
rather nervous, and turned several
times while walking away from the
building, as if looking for something.
Her strang* actions attracted atten
tion. The flames did not burst forth
for several minutes after the woman
had disappeared, and it was then too
late to pursue her.

Orders have been issued to the police

to explain their presence there.
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 29.â A firebug
has been at work In Los Angeles for
nearly two weeks, and In that time
has caused six fires. The average lo?s
at each fire will approximate $30,000.
The authorities believe the fires are the
work of some one who has a mania for
bis fires arid starts them Just to see
buildings burn.
The first of the fires was that which
destroyed a portion of the plant of thÂ»
Los Anseles Brewing Company and
resulted in the death of a r.lght watch
man. Then Schirm'a cement warehouse
was burned; next the stables of the
Los Angeles Lighting Company, ami
two days later the large warehouse of
the Los Angeles Furniture Company
was destroyed. The last serious fire
was that which destroyed the plant of
the Los Angeles Box and Hive Com
pany, together with five residences, but
that was not the last attempt made by
the firebug. Late Thursday night an
attempt was made to burn the shops
of the Pacific Electric Railway Com
pany, Huntington's big plant, probably
the largest of its kind on the coast.
Fortunately the fire was discovered in
time to save the buildings.

WASHINGTON. Jan. 20.â The House
to-day considered whether members of
Congress are entitled to be jpaid mile
age a second time. The controversy
arose on an item in the urgent defi
ciency bill providrfig for two payments
of mileage to Senators and members
of the House on account of the. extra
session, which merged into the regular
session. A point of order was raised
by Maddox of Georgia against the pay
ment of mileage a second time, and
he was supported' by Littlefield of
Maine, who contended that- there had
been' no interregnum and consequently
but one session of Congress, and there
is no authority of lav for a second ap
propriation for mileage.
The interest manifested in the ques
tion was shown by the fact that there
were few empty seats on 'either side
of the chamber when the mileage item
was reached. An adjournment was
taken before a conclusion was reached.
Consideration of the amendments in
creasing the appropriation for the ex
penses of the district land offices pre
cipitated a discussion on the subject
of alleged land frauds, in â¢ which Mon

amendment, took a principal part.

"We are in earnest and terribly in

"A reduction in wages will benefit no
one. The operators would not be bene

Referring to the differential and the

said:

INDIANAPOLIS, Jan. 29.â The open
ing of the Joint conference of Indiana,
Ohio, Illinois, Western Pennsylvania
and West Virginia coal operators and
miners was delayed to-day by the ope
rators holding a caucus to formulate
their demands. At the "caucus last
night the operators found it impossible
to get together. Many operators urged*
that the operators make their demands
conservative. The Western Pennsyl
vania and Ohio operatqrs announced
that they would refuse to consider the
run of mine basis and the 7 cents dif
ferential.
To-day the miners' demands were
presented by President Mitchell, and
a substitute from the operators de
manding a decrease of 15 per cent was
submitted by F. L.. Robbins. Both were
voted down and referred to- the Joint
scale committee.
Officer. Â¦Suggests That Loca
tions Be Made in Four Suit
able Quarters of the Country
â¢XEW YORK, Jan. 29.â Bradstreet's
to-morrow will say. Weather condi
tions have been unfavorable through
out a *.vide area, and while in some in
stances helpful to retail trade, extreme
cold- or heavy snows have rather
sluar^ly disturbed spring trade and re
tarcked transportation. Th*re is a
r.ather quieter feeling found also in
several lines of si>eculation and of in
dustry. An exception to this is found
ifi the South, which section, stimulated
by almoct undreamed of cotton prices,
is preparing to plant an enormous
acreage.
Suring trade, which was opening
actively in the Southwest, has b?en
brought practically to a standstill for
the time being by zero weather. Rather
less satisfactory reports come from the
iron 5 and steel trade. Building is prac
tically suspended at a number of cities
and lumber is generally quieter. Wool
is firm, with a steady volume of busi
ress* at Boston. Wheat, including
fljiur, exports for the week ending Jan
uary 28 aggregate 2.917,622 bushels,
against 3,5^,192 last week and 4,420,065
this week last year.
Business failures for the week end
ing January 2S number 242. against 230
in the like week in 1901 In Canada fail
ures for the week number IS. which
compares with 30 in the same week last
year. . -
R. G. Dun & Co.'s Weekly Review of
Trade to-morrow will say:
Business conditions would be most
satisfactory if present high prices for
the leading staple? were the reÂ«ult of
â¢wholesale demand, but the prominence
of manfpula*ion prevents any such
gratif jMng conclusions. Aside from the
lines temporarily stimulated by severe
weather trade is Quiet, and evidences
of increased activity with the approach
o* spring are hopefully awaited. Re
j.orts of the building outlook have been
prepared by branch ofliif-s of R. G.
Dun"& Co. at the leading cities and in-
that high cost of materials and
labor hnvc curtailed operations, al
though the year liÂ»03 showed a good
p? t in .over 1902. Demand for lumber is
KTsadrtally improving, stocks in the
yards are liRht as a result, and at
tractive prices promise a large cut.
Weather conditions are favorable for
wir/.er wheat. Transportation has suf
fered some interruption by storms, but
railway earnings thus lar reported for
January are 3 8 per cent larger than in
1902.
Optimistic reports are not numerous
leez-rding the iron and steel industry.
Comparatively quiet conditions in hides
have not dc-pressed the tone. Failures
this treek numbered 202 in the United
States, against 242 last year, and 2S in
Canada compared with 30 a year ago.

President Says a Reduction in

JOHN
. WASHINGTON, Jan. 29.â Th^ Senate
to-day adopted-' the resolution, intro
duced, by.- Culberson for the Demo
cratic caucus which calls on .the Presi
dent to state whether the Senate, has
been supplied with all the faÂ«ts bear
ing on the controversy of Panama. The
vote on the resolution was unanimous,
but there was a rollcall on the amend
ment suggested by Cullom, for the,Re
publican side of the chamber, calling
for the information only , in .case the
President should consider it not : in
compatible with the public interest to
supply it. This amendment was adopt
ed, all the Republican Senators present
voting for. the, amendment and all the
Democrats, .'except McEnery (who
voted with 'the. Republicans); casting
their votes* against it. There were dur
ing the debate"frequent assurances that
notwithstanding the modification^ all
the papers''".- .bearing on the question*
would be; sent to the Senate.., â¢
The Culberson inquiry- no sooner had
been disposed of than the Bacon reso
lution looking to_ the adjustment of our
differences with. Colombia by. arbitraf
tion was considered. Bacon made an
extended speech in support of theprop
osition. Â¦;'Â¦ . '?<^ ' 'Â¦â¢ â¢Â¦â¢ '"', :.-'
Much of Bacon's discourse was de
voted to presenting the question' of ar
bitration for the settlement of interna
tional disputes. .
He said we first should proceed by
conciliatory advances toward Colom
bia and in case our proffer should, not
be favorably received then the entire
matter should "be submitted to arbitra
tion. He said even if we assumed that
all of the representations of the
United States were true and all those
of Colombia false, still there was an is
sue and the proper way to settle it was
the way of peace and conciliation.
He did not contend that our right to
recognize Panama should be arbi
trated, but he did hold that a question
fpr arbitration was presented in the
differences that have arisen over ttye
construction of the treaty of 1846.
Speaking of the proposition to tender
the good offices of the United States in
order to settle the controversy be
tween Colombia and Panama, Bacon
said that this mode of proceeding
would be inadequate because it would
not take into account Colombia's dif
ferences with the United States. In
this connection he reiterated that the
Panama revolution an accom
plished fact and said he further was
convinced that the .canal would be
built at Panama. This being true, he
argued that "there is no more impor
tant duty than to remove whatever
source of friction there may. be."
He said he heard it stated that Co
lombia would be perfectly conciliated
if the United States would devote
IIQ.OOO.OOO for the purpose of building
a railroad connecting Bogota with the
canal. If such were the case he did
not believe the United States could do
better than to meet the suggestion fa
vorably. The Senate, then went into
executive. session and at 5:15 p. m. ad
journed until Monday.

Last night, after twenty years of
successful pleasure giving, the assem
bly closed its career of 1904 with a
flare of trumpets. And here's to. its
next season! May it be as brilliant
as the one just closed!
By 10 the guests began to arrive in
bevies, and what a stunning lot of
women! "What of the men?" Why,
they, too, were distinctive and metro
politan. But at balls it's the women
that make the picture. Cut out the
white shoulders, the gleaming jewels,
the glittering, shimmering gowns and
what sort of a picture would" you
have? True, there might be more
verve, more spontaneity to the sport,
if dancing can be classed sport, but
the visual picture would suffer.
The assembly has come and gone,
leaving, behind it a plenitude of chat
over the music â real Greenway music
â the gowns, the men, the maids and
a polite enthusiasm over a delectable
supper.
With exquisite grace Mrs. Alfred
Hunter Voorhies received the gruests
in the ballroom, assisted by Mrs. J.
Malcolm Henry, Mrs. John D. Spreck
els, Mrs. William G. Irwin and Mrs.
H. E. Huntington.
So chaste is the ballroom, with its
ivory walls and cold traceries and Its
innumerable astral lights, further dec
oration seemed an instance of â¢paint
ing the lily. Therefore the decora
tions were confined to the end of the
Â¦ballroom, whence the music came.
Here a latticed wall of trailing vines,
supported by palms, gave the only
touch of color, save the scarlet divans^
along the wall, to the room of revelry.'

After so brisk a season â the like of
which San Francisco has never known
beforeâ weariness or satiety would
stalk abroad, but nay! At least, not
so one. can see It. But perhaps the
masseuseâ bless her â can tell a tale
about that. v

At midnight the merry throng for
sook the ballroom fc-r the allurements
of the Maple room, where supper was
spread. The tables were of varying
sizes,, though each was similarly ap

V.'. McXear and S. C. Buckbee, a dele
ration' from the beard of governors of
the Automobile Club of California,
v aited on the commission and request
ed to be heard in respect to the pro
posed ordinance to regulate the use of
automobiles in Golden Gate Park. The
Ocmrriisslortrs decided to defer consid
l eration of the subject until the regular
ir.o^ti-gr of the board in February. The
ordinance will not be passed to print
until a full hearing Is given.
fcrooks Ridley, v.ho has agreed to
deliver to the chief of the San Fran
cisco Fire Department an electric au
tomobile that will run twenty miles in
nr><? hour without making a stop, asked
ct the commission the privilege of test
inz the machine on t!ie park roads at
some early morning hour.
MAY USE SOUTH DRIVEL
Request to use the main highway was
denied, but permission was given for
the test en the south road and over
look drive. The test will be made un
<jpr the supervision of Superintendent
McLaren.
The question of giving a name to
the new lake In Golden Gate Park
ram? up. The president suggested
that it be designated as Model Yacht
Lake. Commissioner Sullivan main
tained that it should be named
Spreckels Lake in honof of the pres
ident of the commission, as he orig
inated the enterprise and gave the
Â¦work throughout his personal atten
tion. The president insisted that he
was not entitled to the honor and
;<dded that the Model Yacht name be
accepted. Commissioner Sullivan put
tho motion to name the lake for the
president and it prevailed by the votes
of SnJUvmn, Lloyd and Altman.
Â»\. d Campbell and P. Jennicke,
representatives of the Oceanside Im
p!Â«vemer.t Club, waited on the com
mission, presenting a request that the
prys company be granted the privilege
of* laying a main in the park, so that
illy? dwellers' on the south side near
the ocean might be supplied with gas
foT* Xluxninatins and cooking pur
poses.
DANGEROUS AUTOISTS.
It was explained to the board that
the main now extends to the spot
known as Coney Island, near the salt
water pumping station. The dele
gates said that light was needed in
that region, as the "autos" raced at
frightful speed in the night, endanger
ing the lives of persons going from
IJoulevard station to their homes.
The representative? of the club were
advised to confer with the gas com
pany and ascertain if the corporation
would agree to light the boulevard or
<3o anything else for the public in the
event of the commission granting the
privilege desired. Commissioner Lloyd
remarked that the water company had
declined to even supply free water for
a drinking fountain. It was the sense
of the board that the gas company
give the public something in
exchange for the privilege asked for.
Commissioner Altman submitted a
tiesig.*i f~>r the ornamental stone gate
nt the Stanyan-street entrance to the
Park. George McGillvary will supply
'lie stone and do the work for $2194.
This sum approximates the amount
given by Mrs. McCauley for the mem-
A meeting of the Board of Park Com
miEsioTiers was held yesterday after
noon at the lodge in Golden Gate Park,
President A. B. Spreckels presiding.
Commissioners Lloyd, Sullivan and
-Vl.tman and Superintendent John Mc-
Laren attended the session. The su
perintendent reported that a coyote
shot and killed in the park last
Thursday. The president reported that
Mongolian pheasants â six hens and a
roister â had arrived all right from Gil
roy. The commission gave a vote of
thar.ks to Elmer Ilea and the presi
dent for their enterprise and skill in
capturicg the pheasants. The super
intendent will keep the birds in the
*Â»viary for a few days before giving
them the freedom of the park.
The transport Sheridan will sail on
Monday, February 1, at 12 o'clock noon,
for Manila, via Honolulu. Besides a
large number of casuals she will carry
members of the hospital corps, the sig
nal corps and about fifty convalescents
v.ho are going out to join the different
regiments to which they belong.
The Tenth Infantry held its monthly
field sports yesterday on the lower pa
rade grounds. Major R. C. Van Vliet
acted as master of ceremonies. The
games were marked with great zest
and snirit and were hugely enjoyed,
by both participants and spectators.
Lieutenant Alden Trotter, Twenty
fifth Company, Coast Artillery, was ad
mitted to the general hospital yester
day and to-day will undergo an opera
tion for appendicitis.
Lieutenant Sherman A. "White regis
tered at headquarters yesterday. He is
en route to Malabang to join his regi
ment, stationed there.
The attendance was large, not only
of the post people, but a big delegation
of town folks went out to lend a help
ir.g hand to the worthy cause.
The entertainment was eirftvened by
the music of the post stringed orches
tra, which rendered an excellent pro
gramme of choice selections.
The guests were received by Mrs.
Morris, Mrs. Rawles, Mrs. Todd, Mrs.
Serrait. Mrs. Hinckley, Mrs. Conklin,
Mrs. Lewis; Mrs. Landers and Mrs.
Langdon.
Fluttering about the room and look
ing after the general welfare of every
body were Miss Effie Morris, Miss
Swigert, MHss Hobbs, Miss Gerrard,
Miss Serratt. Miss Moon, Miss Berry
and Miss O'Hara.
The coffee table, decked with red
geraniums and red candelabra, was
presided over by Mrs. Overton, Mrs.
Morris and Mrs. Rubottom.
The tea table, which was crowned
with yellow daffodils and yellow can
delabra, was in charge of Mrs. Rock
hill, Mrs. Andrews and Mi's. Maxwell.
Mrs. Fair and Mrs. Lemon had charge
of the cup table.
At the Presidio yesterday the atten
tion of the officers and ladles stationed
there was largely given over to the
benefit to Sirs. Lincoln, the deaconess
of the post. It was a most deserving
appeal, as Mrs. Lincoln's services are
almost invaluable. Almost her entire
time is devoted to assisting In the
United States general hospital, where
she helps the patients in many useful
ways, in writing letters for them to
their relatives and friends and with
cheering words of comfort and hope.
In fact, she acts as a staff to help
those that are afflicted with severe ill
ness. Her bright smile and happy
countenance always bring a ray of sun
shine into the sick wards whenever she
appears upon the scene.
The tea was In every way a success.
The hop room was gayly decorated
with a profusion of evergreens, while
the national colors were much in evi
dence. The room had taken on the air
of a reception hall. The floor was cov
ered with heavy rugs and here and there
were comfortable divans, and cozy cor
ners were much in evidence.
The ladies of the post had worked
hard and diligently and their efforts
were crowned with success.
Mrs. C. Morris and Mrs. J. B. Rawles
had charge of the general management
of the affair, and to them is largely due
the success of the entertainment. They
were most ably assisted by Miss Mor
ris and Miss Rawles.

Privilege to Gas Company
DENVER, Jan. 29.â W. T. Coolldee,
who was reported to have been drowned
at Long Beach, Cal., last August, and
who was mourned as dead by some of
his relatives, has been found alive at
Sheridan. Wyo. This discovery saves
benevolent orders and insurance com
panies $11,000, the amount for which
he was insured.
Relatives of Coolidge are. accused of
trying to collect the insurance, know
ing that he was alive, and they may
be prosecuted. Coolldge is believed not
to have been implicated in any such
attempt. He was- arrested, but as he
told a straightforward story he was
released. He Bald he became estranged
from his wife, who was living in Den
ver, and went to the coast, where he
caused the report to be circulated that
he had been drowned. From San Fran
cisco he traveled over the greater part
of the country, but always under an
assumed name. He had, he said, no
intention of defrauding any one. but
had intended to start life anew.
For years Coolidge taught in the
country schools about Denver and was
prominent in the Order of Modern
Woodmen. At the time his death was
reported his wife had instituted divorce
proceedings, and the suspicions of the
insurance companies were aroused.

Hon. Kitt Gould, Chicago, Repre-
sentative of the Third Senatorial District,
and for four years the attorney for the
State Board of. Pharmacy of Illinois,
says:
"I have been a great Bufferer from
Catarrh of the stomach, dyspepsia and
Indigestion, which completely ' upset my
nervous system. Munyon's Paw Paw has
driven out these distressing ailments
and has restored all my old-time energy
and vim. It Is a marvelous remedy."
The Hon. Samuel W. Lane of
Augusta. Me., is a national figure of such
prominence that he needs no Introduc-
tion at our hands. He says:
"I am pleased to state that I have been
using Munyon's Paw Paw for two
months with the greatest benefit. I have
been a sufferer for forty years from
Malaria and Dyspepsia, and for the care
of the latter I consider Paw Paw abso-
lutely unequaled.**
â¢Arcadivs Avellanva, Dr. Litt, Dr.
Ph., of Philadelphia, the most distin-
guished Latin scholar living, says:
"Prof. Munyon is entitled to the praise
of the entire medical fraternity and the
people as well for developing the re-
markably curative qualities of Paw Paw
and combining them with other medica-
ments In a remedy which will cure any
curable case of Dyspepsia." f
Captain Chas. A. De Arnaud, Wash-
ington. D. C. the man of whom President
Lincoln said: "Congress and the nation
owe Capt. De Arnaud a debt of grati-
tude for his services to Gen. Grant," an<l
whose damage suit for $200,000 against
Gen. Farnsworth will be tried this week,
says:
"I was a great sufferer from vertigo>
and could hardly walk. A Grand Army
comrade induced me to try Paw Paw.
and the results have been marvelous. I
desire to thank you In behalf of all suf-
ferers for the good you are doing."
Maj. De Batz of Washington, D. C,
j official translator of all foreign letters
and documents, says Paw Paw cured him
of acute indigestion, general debility and
I made him feel like a new man.
j So the good reports come In from
I every section. One cured person spreads
the news to his friends of this new vep-
etable pepsin which makes old stomachs
almost as good as new, and so the wave
of health goes on and on. People who
have been troubled for years with sleep-
! lessness say that since taking Paw- Pa-w
| they can sleep all night and get up feel-
| ing strong and refreshed. If you need a
tonic, if you need strength and good
cheer, try a bottle of Paw Paw and you
will have no need for any other stimu-
lant.

BERKELEY. Jan. 29.â Miss Erma F.
Shipe, a young woman of West Berke

week with William Engle, and the first
Information her parents had that she
was a bride came with letters from her
announcing her marriage. She wrote
the letters while speeding on the way
East with her husband, St. Loui3 being
their destination.
The parents of Mrs. Engle are Mr.
and Mrs. J. A. Shlpe of 1517 Fifth
street. They knew of her engagement
to Engle. who was a clerk in the au
diting department of the Southern Pa
cific Company, but objected to her mar
rying Just yet. She was a governers in
a wealthy family In San Francisco,
who wsre about to take her to Europe
with them.
In the face of parental opposition
Miss Shipe was obdurate. Her father
and sister. Miss Margaret Shipe, visited
her in San Francisco on Monday in the
hope of dissuading her from continuing
her engagement with Engle, but she re
fused to listen to their importunities.
The night afterward Miss Snipe dis
appeared from her place as governess.
Her whereabouts remained a mystery
until to-day, when her parents received
word from * her through . the letters.

Mary Davitt, wife of Michael Davitt,
the Irish patriot, .of Dalkey, Dublin
County, Ireland, and Archbishop Rior
dan of San Francisco will share the es
tate of the late Mary Canning, who
was buried yesterday. She leaves an
estate of $78,000 in cash on deposit in
the Oakland Bank of Savings and her
home, at Sixteenth and Myrtle streets
in this city, valued at more than $15,000.
Her will was filed this afternoon by At
torney Garret McEnerney of San Fran
cisco, who at the same time filed the
petition of the Union Trust Company of
San Francisco, named as . executor irt
the will, for special letters of adminis
tration, which were granted by Judge
W. E.. Greene.
The will was signed on the 4th of Ia3t
month and provides as follows:
"I give one-half of my estate to my
niece. Mary Davitt; I give the other
one-half of my estate to the Roman
Catholic Archbishop of San Francise<->.
to be used by him in founding and
maintaining a home for the aged poor
in the city of Oakland, to be conducted
if practicable by the Little Sisters of
the Poor. If any of my estate given In
this will should fail or be invalid, then
in that event I give the same to George
Montgomery. 1100 Franklin street, San
Francisco."
The petition states that there are sev
eral nephews and nieces, but none live
in California except William John Tore
of this city. The will, it is recited, was
made without any duress, menace or
fraud. The witnesses are W. W. Garth -
waite, 641 El Dorado street. Oakland,

In conversation afterward Dunne
stated that he wished to make a plea
tor clemency for his client. He said:
"McKowen is no common felon and I
wished to point out to the Judge that
he has made what restitution is possi
ble. He has turned over to the re
gents about $4000 worth of real es
tate and about $300 in cash. He has
pleaded guilty and saved the State
the expense of a trial. While all this
is not much it should be taken into
consideration."
. Attorneys Peter Dunne and H. M.
Wright of San Francisco appeared in
court with McKowen this morning,
but there was little for them to do.
Attorney Dunne, addressing the court,
requested to be allowed to make a
short statement before the Judge pro
nounced sentence, but upon Judge
Hall's postponing the date of sen
tence he â ''-i he would wait until that
time. ,

"The nineteenth century was a period
of extraordinary expansion in all ac
tivities, but none of these growths was
more rapid than that of journalism. It
long ago burst the bonds of its early
limitations and assumed a right to
share in all activities of the world. It
has grown without the aid of the uni
versity, though the university itself has
spread out in every direction and now
has become encyclopedic.
"Continued efforts are being made to
found schools for Journalism. Lately a
millionaire has given $2,000,000 for such
a school in Columbia University. Well,
$2,000,000 ought to get success. We know
it will win out, but we are not sure
what kind of journalism it will teach.
"The emphatic point in Journalism is
that to be news an event must be of
(jurrent interest. All events have a vital
relation to the welfare of humanity,
and Journalism aims to make that rela
tion known. It sifts all points down to
the point where they are of vital Inter
est to the community. The newspaper
tells a man what there is in this world
that affects himself. It teaches him
that whatsoever happens in this world
has some meaning to hLjn.
"The news editor teaches his em
ployes what news Is, and I believe that
knowledge could be taught in the uni
versity. It would not be a scientific les
son, of course. It would' be an essen
tially popular lesson. It would 'bring
the attention of the, student to the
things that are going on about him.
and he would learn what the interests
of the great mass of people are. Jour
nalism affects life In so many ways
that the' university ought to assist in
training, men to take part in it."
JOURNALISJI'S ADVANCE.
"There is something in journalism to
be explained. We give the meeting of
your regents .a half-column and your
football game a page, and thus seem
to rank scholarshiD beneath sports;
but, as a matter of fact, the larger
space is given to sports only because
they have a larger Interest for the pub
lic.
President Wheeler gave Mr. Mc-
Naught leave to speak upon anything
he chose, "because he represents the
best that is in journalism to-day." Mr.
Wheeler gave the opposite views of two
great editors upon the qualifications
necessary for a successful newspaper
man. Horace Greelev asked "God to
save him from all the horned cattle
from the university in the newspaper
office"; Charles Dana was not satisfied
with anything . less than a man who
had a doctor's degree and could sing
the "Odes of Ajax" of Sophocles. Mr.
McNaught chose Journalism for his
topic, speaking in part as follows:
"Let us see if we can't strangle the
disposition to plant the rystem on this
coast. Now is the time to stop it, for
if it once sets a hold it will be hard
to root out."
"The attitude of the Eastern univer
sities toward the man that breaks
training rules is the result of a pro
cess of evolution. There is nothing
revolutionary about It. In the early
days there was no training. Then
came the system of pledging the ath
lete to abstinence. Then the honor
system was adopted, under which a
man was expected to do his full duty
without surveillance.
"After all it is honor that is the
basis of it all. If we have not that,
then disintegration follows. The man
that trains gets disgruntled because
another does not. It breeds disrespect
for the coach. He falls into disrepute
and others try to run the team, with
the final result of dissolution.
FORCED TO LEAVE COLLEGE.
â¢ "When an Eastern college man
breaks training he is ostracized. He
is ignored and often forced *o leave
the college. But he is first given a
fair warning, and he never can plead
ignorance.
"The system of recruiting athletes
from the preparation schools is un
fortunately common in the East, but
is altogether new here. I mean the
practice of offering unfair Inducements
to the bÂ£St men from the 'prep' schools
to enter the university offering the In
ducement. The system is a bad one.
It creates, suspicion,,. exhibits a lack of
dignity and brings about a lower stand
ard ' â¢ the whole college community.
These abuses would be removed if the
colleges acted fairly, and Harvard is
now setting a - good example in that
direction-
In introducing: Mr. Reid. President
Wheeler, who presided, spoke ot him
as a 'man who used to go to Harvard,
and in whom at that time more people
were interested than in President
Eliot." Mr. , Reid was once captain of
the Harvard football team and the
idol of the college as a player. Re
sponding, he spoke upon "The Ethics
of College Sport," saying in part:
The students et the University of
California were addressed this morn-
Ing in Harmon Gymnasium by "William

Mrs. Gratziano said Orio returned

Gratziano accused him of the shoot

The boy testified he was walking

shortly after Orio and Gratziano had
quarreled over money. â¢
"I heard a noise behind us and

my father twice and firing a third shot

Thursday night Squires visited the
room occupied and paid for by his
wife at 953 Folsom street, and, for no
cause whatever, beat her horribly. : In
court Squires was surly and unrespon
sive to questions 'and was promptly
sentenced to six months in the County

some lighter sentence, but- the Judge
was obdurate.
Mrs. Squires was so badly .abused
by her husband that she -will be un

George Squires, a teamster by occupa

As evidence of the assault the. poor
woman appeared with her face bat

tle 4-year-old boy, with a weight of
unearned grief, in his big eyes and a
t?nder trust tn his mother that caused
him to grasp her hand and hug it when
she broke into tears in telling her
story to the Judge.
She said Squires had never been a
good husband from the day she mar
ried him. Although he earned good
wages, he refused to contribute to the
support of herself or the two children
she had borne him. Four months
ago, she^saldrone of the little ones, 2
years of age, sickened and died for
lack of medical attention. At a time
when her own meager means were ex
hausted and medical attention could
have saved the life of the child she
wrote to her husband, who had de
serted her. and asked him for aid. He
made " p reply and the baby was
buried under distressingcircumstances,
while the father was enjoying himself
in roistering.

'/Â¦IS A BRUTAL HUSBAXD
With the view to preventing Interna
tional complications between this coun
try and China over the arrest and sub
sequent suicide of Tom Kim Tune, a
military attache of the Chinese lega
tion at Washington,- and formerly a
member of the Imperial bodyguard at
Peking, the Police Commissioners met
yesterday afternoon ana heard the tes
timony of the arresting officers # and
others. ' *^*Â»L;r iV t-- '
This action was Â¦ taken because <the
Chinese Consul; here had forwardÂ«d to
the Chinese Embassador at Washing
ton the evidence taken at the Coroner's
Inquest on Tom Kim Yung's body. The
transcript had been handed' by the Em
bassador to Secretary of State Hay,
who forwarded it to. Governor Pardee,
who in turn sent it to Mayor Schmitz
with a request that an investigation
be made and the result forwarded to
Washington. The' Mayor made the-re
quest to Chief Wittman and the in
quiry was held, as stated. â¢ â¢
The arresting officers. John H. Kra
mer and Joseph. Brodt, testified to hav
ing been sent in plain clothes on\the
night of September 10 to raid an opium
resort at 711 Stockton street, when cir
cumstances arose that compelled them
to place Tom Kim Tung under arrest
for violating one of the city ordinances.
The Chinese, who was a tall, powerful
man, resisted arrest and another offi
cer and two citizens had to help them
before the handcuffs were placed over
his wrists. No unnecessary j violence
was used.
Lieutenant 'Gleeson, the" officials at'
the City Prison and others testified to
the Chinese being ugly and violent, and
they all denied that there was any
blood or bruise on his face. He_was
released frc-m prison within a few min
utes after his arrest, and it ! was not
known who he was till after his re
lease, for he gave the name of Con
Chin. Gleeson further testified that
the secretary of the Chinese. Six Com
panies came to him shortly after the
arrest and was very anxious that the
case should not ,be taken into the Po
lice Court.
Detective Wren testified to having
been called to the Chinese consulate
on September 14 and finding Tom> Kim
Yung's dead b6dy in one of therooms v
there. A physician who had been called
had given the cause of death as gas
asphyxiation and opium. Chinese
at the consulate told Wren that Tom
Kim Yung had that morning asked if
his case could not be fixed, and when
he was .to!d it would have to go to
trial he went upstairs, and that- was
the last seen of him alive.
After the testimony is transcribed it
will be forwarded to the Secretary of
State at Washington.
Action Is Taken at Request
of the Chinese Embassador

Some of .the defendants were put on
the stand, : and they, all declaimed
against the accusation that any un
usual disorder was committed by them
in the cafe. The spinning of chairs
across the floor, they said- was merely
a national game, and the man who
came nearest to the kitchen door "with
out hitting it was entitled to the cake
and all the cold pie on the dump.
Judge Mogan was up in the air higher
than he had ever gone before-^-which
is going someâ in order to determine
the'merits of the case. Finally he ad
journed the hearing until to-day and
issued a subpena for the owner of the
premises, who will act as, anamlcus
curiae to further elucidate the puzzling
problem.
John Rayborn, who is a natural borta
manager, had. charge of the lodging
house at the time and he was the comr
plaining witness in the. case. He testi
fied that for two . weeks previous to
the arrest there-, was' so much ' noise
from the congregated Assyrians in the
cafe that the phonograph machines
across the street went out of business.
He said he couldn't even hear the cash

been the fact that. the cohorts played
a peaceful game by rolling chairs across

The Assyrians came down like a wolf
on the fold yesterday in Judge Ma
gan's court. To look at an old map,
Assyria seems to be about the size and
color of a 8peciaf*dellvery stamp.* If

Tin ore is reported to have been dls
coverd in Nevada near Carson City.
The Carson Appeal, which is authority
for the statement, says:
A few days ago one of the local prospectors
took a Diece of ore to one of Carson's aasay
ers, where a tost was made for tin. The
specimens *how the metal in considerable
quantity and the exact amount is to be de
termined by actual tests. The specimens came
from wltfcln a few milea of this city and the
party bringing it in claims to have a good
body of ore. Should the percentage be high
enough there is a fortune in it for the owner
ns a tin mine is as valuable as a cold mine or
any of the other mÂ»talÂ«. In apeaking of this
the assaver Bald that the trouble with the
prospectors is that too much time is wapfd
in huntlncr un gold and silver, while the rent
"f the metals are left to the expert who will
happen alons In the course of time. Usually
the prospector will take a horning of the ore
or make a simDlc te^t for silver end Jn case
of a failure the property is dropped from the
list and it is regarded as an abandoned claim.
DISCOVERY OF TJX ORE.
According to the Grass Valley Un
ion the Tule Belle mine will be started
again. The company operating the
property owns 130 acres at Cincinnati
Hill, Xevada County.
W. H. Mathewson has deeded to Woodard
T. Carter n one-quarter interest in the Blue
Jay and Jack Kabbit mines with mill site.
Otto Kanig has deeded to the Republic Mining
and Milling Company the Concord quartz
mining claim. On Saturday last Otto Kanig
received the final payment for the Kanig mine
which had been under bond to Mr. Willhelm
A four-stamp mill, which. was taken from the
fourteen-3tamp one on the Der.smore. is being
placed on the property. Mr. Kanig has other
mines in that locality which he is developing.
W. H. Mathewson and C. A. Belli have deeded
to Fred T. Robson a one-third interest in the
Weybosset cold quartz mine.
The Stockton Hill gravel mine, at
Mokelumne Hill, recently reopened, is
reported to have developed well. The
Calaveras Prospect says that the indi
cations have been promising since the
work of reopening the property began.
Recent changes in the ownership of
properties, in Tuolumne County are re
ported by the Tuolumne Independent as
follows:
The Carson Creek property, better known as
the Jones mining property, has been leased to
a wealthy company, with privilege of pur
chasing after a stated time. The same com
pany has bonded the Allison group of mines
adjoining the Carson Creek property. Active
operations are to begin on both properties
within th? next two or Ihree weeks. The old
Jones Fhaft is to be unwatered. and Carson
Creek Is to t>e flumed where th<* break into the
Jones mine took place some three years ago,
v.-hen thÂ» mine was flooded from the â¢ waters
pouring into it from the creek. The object in
coins- into the old workings is to reach the
Douglas lode, which lies on the extreme west
of the Carson Creek group. The Dourlas lodÂ«
is considered by competent miners to be the
best property in the group.
The Mountain Echo of Angels Camp
reports that there is a mining boom at
Angels and gives the following partlcu T
lars:
Considerable interest is being: taken in mines
herf that, have Iain dormant for years, and in
many of them development work Is' going on.
Those having performed the requisite amount
of labor on their claims to er.title them to a
patent are applying for Government title, while
thoKe holdinz c!aims of value are hurrying
work and improvements to a sufficient value
to admit them to make application for a Gov
ernment patent.
A convenient arrangement shows the

The Clock's Tick.
A . German psychologist has been
exploding the well known theory that
the "tick-tock" of a clock Is purely
subjective, and that in reality the two
beats sound precisely, alike. This has
often been used as an illustration of
Ex^Secretary of State John W.* Foster/unbosoming
a long cherished opinion, says that Uncle Sam- is the
earth's , peacemaker. * Mr^ Foster rnay be right, but he
should have added that we are getting into a maze of un
necessary and unwelcome trouble in trying to play the
ungrateful role.
Flogging in Prison.
Flogging is still allowed in English
prisons as a punishment for mutiny
or violence, but recently published
statistics make It doubtful whether
even in these extreme cases corporal
punishment serves the purpose for
which it is intended. . It is shown that
since the number of prison- offenses
for which flogging was allowed were
reduced in 1898, the number of of
fenses against prison discipline have
decreased frqm'147 to! 131 per. 1000
prisoners, while there has-been an In
crease in the number of those offenses
for which the- "cat" is still the pen

PATENT-R. P., Marysville. Cal. Any
person who has invented soraetnin*
that he desires to have patented can
make application at the patent office
Washington. D. C, for a patent, hut if
not acquainted with the necessary
forms he is liable to make a mistake
and allow "some other feller" to get a
patent ahead of him. For that reason
It is advisable to employ the services
of a reliable attorney who- makes it a
bu&iness to secure patents.
Representative Cochran sa>;s that J. Pierpont Morgan
is in the unenviable class of the pea and shell man, who
thrives upon the credulity of the bucolic and the fool
ishly wise. This appears to be the first recorded definite
suggestion that, it is possible to insult a manipulator of
the pea and shells.
JURORSâ A. O. T. S.. City. The
law of this State contemplates that a
man to serve on a Jury in the State
courts must be a citizen of the United
States, not less than 21 years of age.
If a man who "married in this coun
try, has resided here forty years never
was naturalized and never voted*
should be called on a Jury he would be
subject to challenge for the reason
that he is not a cltlsen.
Representative Boutell declared a few dayssince that
the record of the Republican party will be its platform
in the coming campaign. He might have added also
that the man who made this record for his party will be
the standard-bearer -of that party in the struggle which
inevitably will close in victory.

AUTHENTIC advices, contained in the newspapers

is bred in Arizona and is shipped to Southern California
to graze. The remaining 25 per cent; of the total beef
consumed in Southern California is bred and raised in the
southern counties. On account of ;the -lack of. early

BOARD OF HEALTH PL.EASE NOTE.
Editor San Francisco Callâ Sir: I
was delighted to see at last some pub
lic reference to the scandalous condi
tion of the ferry depot, as appeared
in your issue this morning in the shape
of a subscriber's letter. I am a long
suffering individual personally, but
have been a- --ed at the apparent
apathy on the part of the public who
daily pass through the stench pervad
ing corridors at the Terry and endure
the ordeal as though it were part of
nature's own ordainment. Many - of
these gentlemen are extremely partic
ular as to their own home and office
appointments and would also make a
lusty outcry if such filthy . conditions
existed in the ordinary thoroughfares
of this city or the one they live in
across the bay. I say nothing of the
ladies; but emphatically think It a
double seand.il and shame that their
natural protectors should .not kick out,
and viciously at, that, against the rail
road company or the ferry guardians
(whoever they are) that compel ladies
to traverse such a chamber, of horrors
as the one now in question. I have
noticed the shrinking and disgust of
ladies who (not being able to use the
upper stairway by the narrow gauge
route) are forced to breathe the offal
scented passageway to the boats, and
can reatllly believe that the experience
is not one conducl e to the improve
ment of a frail and relaxed physical
condition.
However, you have started the ball
rolling, and ' I trust SOMETHING
WILL. BE DONE SOON to remedy the
abuse. It is a black eye. to the city
at present. The means of thoroughly
cleaning the pavement and walls can*
not be wanting. Water is plentiful;
pumping power is not exorbitant; la
bor, judging by the numerous officials
In livery and otherwise whom one sees
always around, the building, is ample;
a good hc-se drenching every night is
absolutely needed in the Â¦ interests of
health, cleanliness and common, de
cency, and once a week hot .water
ought to be. applied to kill the germs
that the ordinary _ washdown has not
carried away. Please, Mr. Call, go -in
for this. reform with all your editorial
vim, and God bless you. Tours, W. M.

Mechanics of the Ear.

Copyright. 1904. by Joseph B. Bowles.
Among the most remarkable curiosi
ties of the human body is the ap
paratus by which the brain cognizes
sound. This organ is known as the
ear, but the ear is much more than
the external t organ ordinarily so
called. In reality there are three ears
â an external ear, a middle ear, or
tympanum, and an internal ear, on
each side.
Before proceeding further with a
description of the sound recording: ap
paratus it will be necessary to briefly
discuss sound. Sound may be rough
ly defined as a series of movements in
the air or in some other medium, the
movements being produced by some
rapidly vibrating body, such as a
membrane, rod or string. A drum
head, for instance, as it vibrates, im
parts to the air a certain agitation â a
series of# waves. The concussion of
these waves against the auditory ap
paratus constitutes sound. * Sound
waves â that is, air waves â may be
compared to waves of water. The
sound waves may be regular and may
strike the ear like the rhythmic break
ing of waves upon the shore. The
sound waves may, on the other- hand,
be irregular and break against the ear
like the chaotic beating of a stormy
surf. In the former case the sound "is
music; in the latter case it is noise.
Sounds vary in three ways. They
have intensity, pitch and quality. In
tensity depends upon the amplitude of
the vibration â upon the height of the
air wave. Pitch depends upon the
length of the air wave. The shorter
the -waves and the more of them that
pass a given point at one time, the
higher the nJtch. For instance, the
pitch of the note "middle C" is pro
duced by an air wave of such length
that 256 strike the air in one second.
A wave of just one-half that length
will cause 512 concussions in one sec
ond and produce a pitch of one octave
higher.
Now, the power of the human ear
to respond to sound waves is limited
to about ten octaves, seven of which
are comprised in music. Any vibra
tions of the air which cause^ less than
thirty concussions per second. or more
than 40,000 per second are not ap
preciated as sound by the average per
son. The lowest note of a great organ
is often below the range of audibility.
Many people cannot hear the fellow
of a whale because the pitch is too
low. On the other hand, the screech
of the bat "is hdard only, by fine ears
because the pitch is too high, and be
yond this are the notes of many in
sects which are quite out of the range
of human audibility. That which is
silence to a man may be pandemonium
to the differently tuned ear of the ani
mal. In fact, anatomical research
shows that to the animals about us
nature is full of sounds that we can
not hear.
Now the external ear, with its com
plex folds terminating in the concha
into which the auditory canal opens,
is merely a trumpet-like device for the
purpose of collecting the air. waves
and conducting them to the sound re
cording apparatus of the tympanum,
or middle ear. At the middle ear the
sound waves impinge upon the mem
brana tympani, or ."drum" of the ear,
to which is attached the mechanism
which transmutes these minute and
rapid concussions, of air into that state
of consciousness known as sound.

J. S. Gilbert, an American sojourning
in Panama, is not especially Impressed
with the advantages of that new re

he certainly did not indite the follow

Obsolete Weapons.
Many military critics have declared
that the South African war demon
strates that the bayonet is an obsolete
weapon, but Colonel C. B. ilayne. an
English officer, who has for twenty
years been known as an authority on
Infantry weapons, thinks otherwise.
Even in South Africa, which he con
siders an exceptional case, he says that
the British bayonets often kept the
Boers from coming to close quarters
and thus taking full advantage of their
victories. Nor does he think long range
firing likely to be the decisive factor â
"it is the short range fighting, includ
ing the bayonet assault, that decides."
However, as he calls 800 yards "short
range" it will be seen that with maga
zine guns and plenty of ammunition no
bayonet is likely to be stained with
bloody If the cold steel is retained it
will be chiefly for Its moral influence
and for possible use in a night chares
or against a foe that Is short of
cartridges.
UNDER the title, "California Mines and Minerals,"
an attractive pamphlet, handsomely illustrated, has
been compiled by Charles G. Yale, statistician of
the State Mining Bureau, for distribution at the St.
Louis Exposition. Recognizing that in multitude <}f
things to be seen, heard and. read at the great fair,
the visitor will not have much time to give to any
one subject, and will turn away impatiently from any
offered document that appears verbose or heavy, this
compilation has been compressed into the briefest pos
sible space. No attempt is made to deal exhaustively
with our mineral .resources. Nothing has been given
bej'ond a statement of results, and the consequence is
the reader can see- at a glance what" the mineral indus
tries of the State are yielding at this time.
It is not likely the effect desired by the compiler will
be lessened *>y the terseness of statement he has been
forced to adopt. The showing is sufficiently notable to
impress the mind of every reader who has any interest
at all in mineral industries, and thus lead him to seek
further information. Enough, in fact, is made evident
by the results of our mining operations to confirm Cali
fornia's highest claim to pre-eminence as a mining State,
and the statistics of the results are in this little pamph
let, expressed, all compact, for the understanding of even
the hastiest reader.
A summary of the whole is thus 'given:
"The "total value of the metallic substances for 1902
was $22,069,327, which gold, silver, mineral
paint, quicksilver, copper, lead, manganese, platinum and
chrome. The total value of non-metallic substances was
$3,706,36$. These Â¦ substances include borax, coal,
chrysoprase, mineral waters, salt, infusorial earth, gyp
sum, magnesite, pyrites, lithia mica, fuller's earth, quartz
crystals, mica, soda, tourmaline and turquoise. The
total value of hydrocarbons and gases was $5,184,387, an
increase of $1,651,678. The hydrocarbons and gases in
clude asphalt, bituminous rock, natural gas and petroleum.
The number of barrels of oil produced was 14,356,910,
valued at $4,692,189, as against 7,710,315 barrels in 1901,
valued at**$2,Q6i,iO2. The total value of structural mate
rialswas $4,100,023, an increase of $1,161,748 over the pre
vious year. These materials include brick and pottery
clays, Portland cement, lime and limestone, macadam,
rubble and concrete rock, paving blocks, marble, granite,
sandstone, serpentine, slate and glass sand.''
The record shows that forty-four mineral substances
are exploited in the . State, that the mineral valuation
is upward c' $35,060,000 and is increasing at an average
rate of nearly. $2,000,000 a year. .It is to be added that
this does not represent by any -means the best that
can b** expected of our mining industry, there being
numerous mineral claims that have not yet been prop
erly developed, so that there remain golden opportunities
for new investments and new enterprises.

Electrical, mechanical and pneu- j
matie engineer? are ever at work to
check the American's propensity to
take chances. They are constantly
designing and improving: automatic j
device? calculated to remove the j
temptation to take a chance by elim
inating the chance, particularly in the
operation of railroads.
They recognize the unquestionable
fact that whenever a citizen of this
great and glorious country starts for
somewhere he insists on getting there
at the earliest possible moment and is
perfectly willing to Lake the chance of
turning his life insurance policy into
current coin by traveling a mile or
more a minute. They maintain, how
ever, that it is unnecessary for him to
have to take chances in order to
travel at maximum speed. They plan
and think and do things on the propo
sition that the man whose hand is on
the throttle lever in the engine cab
must have no chance to take .chances.
So they are continually scheming to
tise electricity, compressed' air, sem
aphores, disks, interlocking machines,
â¢"puzzle" switches, electric motors,
storage batteries, colored lights and
all kinds of safety appliances to make
It absolutely impossible for his loco
motive to run into anything or any
thing to run into him.
That is why railroads are spending
rtiilliona of dollars on automatic
'block" signals and interlocking
switch and signal systems. The great
improvements which have been made
in such devices in the last few years
indicate that before long it will be
possible for an engine to run wild
without a man aboard and yet be au
tomatically stopped before it enters
kn occupied "block."
One has but to take a night ride on
the locomotive of a â¢"limited" or fast
mail, train to thoroughly understand
that no man could be the engineer or
fireman of that locomotive who had in
.him the faintest trace of a streak of
yellow. The disconnected conversa
tion you hold with the engineman
while his swaying, rocking and trem
bling locomotive is eating up seventy
Eiiles of opaque night an hour will
convince you that timidity is an ob
solete word to him: that feer is some-
Jhing he forgot to bring when he left
home, and that caution is an official
utterance to be taken in a Pickwick
ian sense if he's behind time.
Automatic signals are controlled by
the trains which they guard. A rail
road which uses automatic signals is
divided into divisions about three-quar
ters of a mile long, and such divisions
are called "blocks"â hence "block sig
nals." The lengths of these blocks are
Influenced bv the curves or other ob
structions to an engineer's view in the
track, so there is no established length
of track in a block.
Electricity is the agent which not
o.nly transmits to the signal the fact
that a train has entered or left the
block, but It also starts the mechanism
â¢which actuates the signal.
The signal stands at the entrance of a
Hock. A current of electricity continu
ally glows through the rails of the
track. The track of one block is elec
trically separated from the track of the
abutting block. When the rails of the
track are clearâ that is, when no car
wheels of any kind are on them â the
electrical current flows through the
rails of one side of the track, to an
electro-magnet in the signal, thence'
through the rails of the other side of
the track to the battery, completing
the circuit. The instant a pair of
Â¦wheels connected by an axle enters
the block the circuit is changed, for
the current, instead of passing through
the electro-magnet in the signal, crosses
over from one rail to the other through
the wheels and axles. Then several
things happen. '.V:\~-
There is a hissing of escaping com
pressed air heard by one who Is near
the signal post and the drooping sema
phore rises and extends its arm over
the trackâ an emphatic gesture which
means "this block is occupied â stop in
stantly." *' â¢*;.Â¦_ '
The signal mechanism consists of the
electro-magnet, which controls a valve,
a. compressed air cylinder with its pis
ton head arid piston rod, the latter
connected with a lever .which pushes up
the rod that moves the semaphore.
Compressed air is supplied from, the
buried pipe, which brings it ten or
twenty miles from the air compressor.
"When the block is "clear," that is when I
there is no train, car or locomotive on
it. the semaphore hangs down, pointing
groundward. This tells the engineman
that the track irf clear. The semaphore
is held in the "all clear" position by
the compressed air. When a train en
ters the block and short circuits the
current the armature of the de-ener
gized magnet is moved by a spring
opening a valve which allows the com
pressed air to escai>e from the cylinder.
Instantly the semaphore, by force of
gravity, assumes the horizontal or stop
position. ' . j , -
It will be noticed that to hold the
signal at the "all clear" or "safe" posi
tion it is necessary to shove up the
rod which moves the signal. As soon
as this shoving force is released the
weight of the rod and counter balance,
acting on the short arm. of the sema
phore, causes the blade to rise to the
horizontal or "stop" position. Thus
any failure of the current, any leak

the irresistible tendency of the mind
to construct a rhythm, and the "tick"
was supposed to seem different from
the "tock." simply because it came on
the down beat. But Dr. Kosenbach of
Berlin, after vainly consulting the
clockmakers, set himself the problem
to solve, and found that the action of
the mechanism Is snich that the cogs
of the escapement wheel do not strike
the arms of the "anchor" in precisely
the same way. "Tick" comes at the
right, with the cog rising: "tock" at
the left with the cog descending. The
result Is that "tick" is more sharply
accentuated (louder?) and of shorter
duration, while "tock" is higher in
pitch. With this differentiation the
source of the universally felt double
rhythm is apparent. Yet it is none the
less true that by an effort of the will
the rhythm can be reversed, and the
accent put on either beat at will, and
with a Htle practice most people can
hear the ticking of a triple rhythm. â
Springfield Republican.
THE Democratic House leader is Mr. John Sharp
â¢ 'Williams, a very able man. Because he has ability
and can think, he is seeking to find an issue be
tween the two parties upon which a campaign can be
made. He makes an authoritative statement in one
of the February magazines, which we hope will be
widely read, for it discloses an interesting, perhaps a
perilous, condition in American politics. He is cyi-
J dently of the opinion that letting the water out of the
j trust stocks has taken the wind out of the trust issue.
His conclusion is that there is ground for an. issue in
j the tariff, but that free trade is a chimera. " Therefore,
! we must have a tariff for revenue only. -It is popular
i in the South to advocate taking the excise taxes' off
I whisky and tobacco. Indeed, Mr. Blaine and Mr. Ran
dall a-greed on that policy, and the South had many a
pang when it opposed. Blaine, for he had nearly captured
I that section by a policy that would transfer taxes from
excise to imposts. , ,.
This would have put all the production of revenue
upon the tariff. The South has long had that policy up
its sleeve, and every Democratic leader from the South
who makes tariff for revenue only an issue" keeps an
eye upon the possibility of satisfying the business in-
I terests of his section by so reforming the tariff as to
make it even more protective than now". So \\t have
Mr. Williams saying: "The tariff reformer ' who would
< do things recklessly or too suddenly : would run the
j'risk of destroying the very- end which' he had in con
templation by furnishing an object lesson which would
not help but hurt him."
Still he advises thei party to seek power on the issue of
tariff reform. Now if such reform is to furnish an object
lesson that will hurt those who do the reforming, is the
object sought a public benefit? The implication is that
j the object lesson will injure the people, who alone can
j hurt a party by voting it out of power. It is true that
I he qualifies by naming reckless or sudden action as
dangerous, but since the same object is sought, whether
j the action be prompt or deliberate, the time schedule
does not affect the result. If the. protective feature of
the tariff is wrong, in morals and .politics, as 1 Mr. Bryan
insists, it should be destroyed without delay, and the
only object lesson would be beneficial to the destroyers.
Mr. Williams is plainly under restraint from the pro
tection sentiment of the South. ' In explanation of his
position he continues: "I have always thought that there
ought to be about every tariff a degree of flexibility, a
maximum and' minimum â a margin within which, by
international trading and bartering, the friends of un
trammeled, or comparatively untrammeled, commerce
could be rewarded for the admission of our^farm and
mining products free,, or nearly free, encouraged in
their course and others encouraged to imitate it; and
whereby also, incident to the rewarding of these, peoples
pursuing an inimical course toward our commerce could
be punished. They could not complain, because they
would not be punished directly, indeed punishment would
not be the end in view. They would be punished by
their' own act, and their punishment would be remitted
by their own act."
While his statement is turgid, one gathers from it
that he wants a tariff for revenue only, so framed as to
rise and fall automatically with the imposts of the coun
tries with which we trade. It is a Democratic substitute
for the McKinley plan of reciprocity. But reciprocity
leaves either protection or revenue in our own control.
The Williams plan would lose, us -the control of either.
In the administration of his pjan the Secretary of the
Treasury would have to order customs office'rs to reduce
the duty on products from any country in proportion to
its reduction. on ours. It is thinkable that under such a
plan Congress might adjourn and go home leaving an
automatic tariff in force to provide revenue, when the
nations with which we trade, desiring to get at our,
market, would let us into theirs free or so nearly
free that our self-acting tariff would not yield enough
revenue to pay the cost of an extra session to take its
automatic flexibility out of it.
Candidly, we put it to the country, is there enough
in this idea of a tariff to make an issue and warrant
a thoughtful citizen in voting for the party that proposes
it?- Beyond this Mr. Williams has no policy upon which
to invite votes except that a Democratic interstate com
merce bill would give th* Interstate Commerce Com
mission the right to fix all railroad rates. That right
can be given, but it can never be exercised, as no com
mission could ever be appointed capable of such a stu
pendous task. A close reading of Mr. Williams leaves
the impression that; after all, his main reason for mak
ing a campaign at all is that his party is "out" and wants
to get "in." In such a reason the people have no inter
est "\vhatevcr.

"These are sociable times back of
the scenes when the performance is
on," remarked Stage Manager Ferris
Hartman of the Tivoli. "The ladles of
the chorus never received such gallant
attentions during their working hours"
as has been thrust upon them nightly
since the Chicago holocaust occurred."
"That speaks well for the courtesy
of their masculine' coworkers," was
suggested.
"Oh, there has been no notable en
hancement of their Chesterfleldian
lam," said Mr. Hartman. "They have
no time for lah-de-dahing while the
show Is in operation. It's the visit
ors â our unbidden guests â I allude to.
There was a time when no male crea
ture could pass the stage doorkeeper
unless he belonged to the house, but
now It's different. Any man who can

punity, stay as long as he pleases and
do pretty much as he desires. It Is
really affecting to see the deep solici
tude for the safety of theater perform
ers and audiences manifested by al
most every branch of the municipality.
Every inch of the Tivoli stage has
been inspected time and time again by
members of the Board of Supervisors,
members of the Board of Public
Works, members of the Fire Commis
sion and members of every other old
organization that has anything to do
with the city government, and time
and time again the stage has been pro
nounced as well protected from flre
as it possibly could be. But still they
come to obtain new information from
the chorus ladies. They don't seek
knowledge from me, probably because
I'm rude."
"Have you had any trouble with
them?"
"Once. A gentleman with a large
and luminous cigar stuck in his face
flashed his badge, entered and began
to interview a lady of the chorus,
when I mildly reminded him that
smoking was not allowed on the
stage. 'Do you know who I am?' he
angrily demanded, and flashed the
badge. "Without waiting to inspect the
nickel-plated shield and not knowing
whether he was Mayor Schmltz's seal
bearer or the driver of a scavenger
wagon, I plucked the burning brand
from his mouth, chucked it into a flre
bucket and replied. 'No; but I know
who I am.' â¢ He didn't strike me, but
I don't know what might have hap
pened if there had been no ladies
present."

every train standing until some one
discovers the break and repairs it. "
The system Just sketched out is the
electro-pneumatic system, and the sig
nal is the semaphore. On a number of
roads, however, the dlskjis the favorite
for automatic signals. It is worked
entirely by the power of the electro
magnet, requiring no- compressed air.
The disk is made of silk, whichis tautly
stretched on a ring. The ring is bal
anced on a pivot and all are contained
in a strong case mounted on a post.
The case has glass slde.Â«. When the
block is clear the electro-magnet lifts
the disk so that it is entirely hidden in
the upper part of the case, and its ab
sence, showing the white interior of
the case, signals "all clear." An en
tering train short circuits the current,
the di.Â«ks drop and. showing through
the glass, give the "stop" signal.
In another system the signals are
worked by electric motors contained in
boxes at the bottom of the posts. In
wells, near the posts, are storage bat
teries, which supply the current to act
uate the motors, and the storage bat
teries are charged by the dynamo in
the central plantâ perhaps miles away.
There are two signals for each block
mo-anted on a single post; the top sig
nal is called the "home" signal, the
bottom is called the "distant" signal.
When the ?igrnals are semaphores the
"distant" signal is fish-tailed; that is,
deeply notched at the outer end. The
electrical connections are such that
when a train enters a block the "home"
signal comes to the horizontal position,
the "distant" signal remains 'pointing
downward. This indicates that the
block is occupied by a train, but that
the next block ahead is clear. When
the train leaves the first block and en
ters the second the "distant" signal of
the first block flies to the "stop" posi
tion, as does the "home" signal of the
second block, and the "home" signal of
the first block falls to safety. This in
dicates that the train has left the first
blc.^k, but is still in the second. When
the train leaves the second block both
signals of the first block show that tfre
track is all clear for two blocks.

punishment serves the purpose for
which it is intended. . It is shown that
since the number of prison- offenses
for which flogging was allowed were
reduced in 1898, the number of of

BOARD OF HEALTH PL.EASE NOTE.
Editor San Francisco Callâ Sir: I
was delighted to see at last some pub
lic reference to the scandalous condi
tion of the ferry depot, as appeared
in your issue this morning in the shape
of a subscriber's letter. I am a long
suffering individual personally, but
have been a- --ed at the apparent
apathy on the part of the public who
daily pass through the stench pervad
ing corridors at the Terry and endure
the ordeal as though it were part of
nature's own ordainment. Many - of
these gentlemen are extremely partic
ular as to their own home and office
appointments and would also make a
lusty outcry if such filthy . conditions
existed in the ordinary thoroughfares
of this city or the one they live in
across the bay. I say nothing of the
ladies; but emphatically think It a
double seand.il and shame that their
natural protectors should .not kick out,
and viciously at, that, against the rail
road company or the ferry guardians
(whoever they are) that compel ladies
to traverse such a chamber, of horrors
as the one now in question. I have
noticed the shrinking and disgust of
ladies who (not being able to use the
upper stairway by the narrow gauge
route) are forced to breathe the offal
scented passageway to the boats, and
can reatllly believe that the experience
is not one conducl e to the improve
ment of a frail and relaxed physical
condition.
However, you have started the ball
rolling, and ' I trust SOMETHING
WILL. BE DONE SOON to remedy the
abuse. It is a black eye. to the city
at present. The means of thoroughly
cleaning the pavement and walls can*
not be wanting. Water is plentiful;
pumping power is not exorbitant; la
bor, judging by the numerous officials
In livery and otherwise whom one sees
always around, the building, is ample;
a good hc-se drenching every night is
absolutely needed in the Â¦ interests of
health, cleanliness and common, de
cency, and once a week hot .water
ought to be. applied to kill the germs
that the ordinary _ washdown has not
carried away. Please, Mr. Call, go -in
for this. reform with all your editorial
vim, and God bless you. Tours, W. M.

then spoke.

Mechanics of the Ear.
BY W. R. C. LATSON*. M. D.
<Edifor Health Culture Mapaxine. New York.)
Copyright. 1904. by Joseph B. Bowles.
Among the most remarkable curiosi
ties of the human body is the ap
paratus by which the brain cognizes
sound. This organ is known as the
ear, but the ear is much more than
the external t organ ordinarily so
called. In reality there are three ears
â an external ear, a middle ear, or
tympanum, and an internal ear, on
each side.
Before proceeding further with a
description of the sound recording: ap
paratus it will be necessary to briefly
discuss sound. Sound may be rough
ly defined as a series of movements in
the air or in some other medium, the
movements being produced by some
rapidly vibrating body, such as a
membrane, rod or string. A drum
head, for instance, as it vibrates, im
parts to the air a certain agitation â a
series of# waves. The concussion of
these waves against the auditory ap
paratus constitutes sound. * Sound
waves â that is, air waves â may be
compared to waves of water. The
sound waves may be regular and may
strike the ear like the rhythmic break
ing of waves upon the shore. The
sound waves may, on the other- hand,
be irregular and break against the ear
like the chaotic beating of a stormy
surf. In the former case the sound "is
music; in the latter case it is noise.
Sounds vary in three ways. They
have intensity, pitch and quality. In
tensity depends upon the amplitude of
the vibration â upon the height of the
air wave. Pitch depends upon the
length of the air wave. The shorter
the -waves and the more of them that
pass a given point at one time, the
higher the nJtch. For instance, the
pitch of the note "middle C" is pro
duced by an air wave of such length
that 256 strike the air in one second.
A wave of just one-half that length
will cause 512 concussions in one sec
ond and produce a pitch of one octave
higher.
Now, the power of the human ear
to respond to sound waves is limited
to about ten octaves, seven of which
are comprised in music. Any vibra
tions of the air which cause^ less than
thirty concussions per second. or more
than 40,000 per second are not ap
preciated as sound by the average per
son. The lowest note of a great organ
is often below the range of audibility.
Many people cannot hear the fellow
of a whale because the pitch is too
low. On the other hand, the screech
of the bat "is hdard only, by fine ears
because the pitch is too high, and be
yond this are the notes of many in
sects which are quite out of the range
of human audibility. That which is
silence to a man may be pandemonium
to the differently tuned ear of the ani
mal. In fact, anatomical research
shows that to the animals about us
nature is full of sounds that we can
not hear.
Now the external ear, with its com
plex folds terminating in the concha
into which the auditory canal opens,
is merely a trumpet-like device for the
purpose of collecting the air. waves
and conducting them to the sound re
cording apparatus of the tympanum,
or middle ear. At the middle ear the
sound waves impinge upon the mem
brana tympani, or ."drum" of the ear,
to which is attached the mechanism
which transmutes these minute and
rapid concussions, of air into that state
of consciousness known as sound.
Somewhat Soured.
J. S. Gilbert, an American sojourning
in Panama, is not especially Impressed
with the advantages of that new re
public as aÂ» abiding place. At least
he certainly did not indite the follow
ing lines for an immigration pamphlet:
Beyond the Chagres River are pathsâ that
lead to death.
To the fevers deadly br**Â»Â«Â». to malaria â¢
poisonous breath! .
Beyond the tropk: foliage wtfre the alligator

Beyond the Chagrw KlvÂ»r. 'tlÂ» said, the story'*

Are path* that lead to mountains of purest
Â¦ virgin gold:
Bui 'tis my firm conviction, whatever tales
they tell.
That beyond the ChaKirs River all path* lead
straight to hell'.
Obsolete Weapons.
Many military critics have declared
that the South African war demon
strates that the bayonet is an obsolete
weapon, but Colonel C. B. ilayne. an
English officer, who has for twenty
years been known as an authority on
Infantry weapons, thinks otherwise.
Even in South Africa, which he con
siders an exceptional case, he says that
the British bayonets often kept the
Boers from coming to close quarters
and thus taking full advantage of their
victories. Nor does he think long range
firing likely to be the decisive factor â
"it is the short range fighting, includ
ing the bayonet assault, that decides."
However, as he calls 800 yards "short
range" it will be seen that with maga
zine guns and plenty of ammunition no
bayonet is likely to be stained with
bloody If the cold steel is retained it
will be chiefly for Its moral influence
and for possible use in a night chares
or against a foe that Is short of
cartridges.
UNDER the title, "California Mines and Minerals,"
an attractive pamphlet, handsomely illustrated, has
been compiled by Charles G. Yale, statistician of
the State Mining Bureau, for distribution at the St.
Louis Exposition. Recognizing that in multitude <}f
things to be seen, heard and. read at the great fair,
the visitor will not have much time to give to any
one subject, and will turn away impatiently from any
offered document that appears verbose or heavy, this
compilation has been compressed into the briefest pos
sible space. No attempt is made to deal exhaustively
with our mineral .resources. Nothing has been given
bej'ond a statement of results, and the consequence is
the reader can see- at a glance what" the mineral indus
tries of the State are yielding at this time.
It is not likely the effect desired by the compiler will
be lessened *>y the terseness of statement he has been
forced to adopt. The showing is sufficiently notable to
impress the mind of every reader who has any interest
at all in mineral industries, and thus lead him to seek
further information. Enough, in fact, is made evident
by the results of our mining operations to confirm Cali
fornia's highest claim to pre-eminence as a mining State,
and the statistics of the results are in this little pamph
let, expressed, all compact, for the understanding of even
the hastiest reader.
A summary of the whole is thus 'given:
"The "total value of the metallic substances for 1902
was $22,069,327, which gold, silver, mineral
paint, quicksilver, copper, lead, manganese, platinum and
chrome. The total value of non-metallic substances was
$3,706,36$. These Â¦ substances include borax, coal,
chrysoprase, mineral waters, salt, infusorial earth, gyp
sum, magnesite, pyrites, lithia mica, fuller's earth, quartz
crystals, mica, soda, tourmaline and turquoise. The
total value of hydrocarbons and gases was $5,184,387, an
increase of $1,651,678. The hydrocarbons and gases in
clude asphalt, bituminous rock, natural gas and petroleum.
The number of barrels of oil produced was 14,356,910,
valued at $4,692,189, as against 7,710,315 barrels in 1901,
valued at**$2,Q6i,iO2. The total value of structural mate
rialswas $4,100,023, an increase of $1,161,748 over the pre
vious year. These materials include brick and pottery
clays, Portland cement, lime and limestone, macadam,
rubble and concrete rock, paving blocks, marble, granite,
sandstone, serpentine, slate and glass sand.''
The record shows that forty-four mineral substances
are exploited in the . State, that the mineral valuation
is upward c' $35,060,000 and is increasing at an average
rate of nearly. $2,000,000 a year. .It is to be added that
this does not represent by any -means the best that
can b** expected of our mining industry, there being
numerous mineral claims that have not yet been prop
erly developed, so that there remain golden opportunities
for new investments and new enterprises.

Electrical, mechanical and pneu- j
matie engineer? are ever at work to
check the American's propensity to
take chances. They are constantly
designing and improving: automatic j
device? calculated to remove the j
temptation to take a chance by elim
inating the chance, particularly in the
operation of railroads.
They recognize the unquestionable
fact that whenever a citizen of this
great and glorious country starts for
somewhere he insists on getting there
at the earliest possible moment and is
perfectly willing to Lake the chance of
turning his life insurance policy into
current coin by traveling a mile or
more a minute. They maintain, how
ever, that it is unnecessary for him to
have to take chances in order to
travel at maximum speed. They plan
and think and do things on the propo
sition that the man whose hand is on
the throttle lever in the engine cab
must have no chance to take .chances.
So they are continually scheming to
tise electricity, compressed' air, sem
aphores, disks, interlocking machines,
â¢"puzzle" switches, electric motors,
storage batteries, colored lights and
all kinds of safety appliances to make
It absolutely impossible for his loco
motive to run into anything or any
thing to run into him.
That is why railroads are spending
rtiilliona of dollars on automatic
'block" signals and interlocking
switch and signal systems. The great
improvements which have been made
in such devices in the last few years
indicate that before long it will be
possible for an engine to run wild
without a man aboard and yet be au
tomatically stopped before it enters
kn occupied "block."
One has but to take a night ride on
the locomotive of a â¢"limited" or fast
mail, train to thoroughly understand
that no man could be the engineer or
fireman of that locomotive who had in
.him the faintest trace of a streak of
yellow. The disconnected conversa
tion you hold with the engineman
while his swaying, rocking and trem
bling locomotive is eating up seventy
Eiiles of opaque night an hour will
convince you that timidity is an ob
solete word to him: that feer is some-
Jhing he forgot to bring when he left
home, and that caution is an official
utterance to be taken in a Pickwick
ian sense if he's behind time.
Automatic signals are controlled by
the trains which they guard. A rail
road which uses automatic signals is
divided into divisions about three-quar
ters of a mile long, and such divisions
are called "blocks"â hence "block sig
nals." The lengths of these blocks are
Influenced bv the curves or other ob
structions to an engineer's view in the
track, so there is no established length
of track in a block.
Electricity is the agent which not
o.nly transmits to the signal the fact
that a train has entered or left the
block, but It also starts the mechanism
â¢which actuates the signal.
The signal stands at the entrance of a
Hock. A current of electricity continu
ally glows through the rails of the
track. The track of one block is elec
trically separated from the track of the
abutting block. When the rails of the
track are clearâ that is, when no car
wheels of any kind are on them â the
electrical current flows through the
rails of one side of the track, to an
electro-magnet in the signal, thence'
through the rails of the other side of
the track to the battery, completing
the circuit. The instant a pair of
Â¦wheels connected by an axle enters
the block the circuit is changed, for
the current, instead of passing through
the electro-magnet in the signal, crosses
over from one rail to the other through
the wheels and axles. Then several
things happen. '.V:\~-
There is a hissing of escaping com
pressed air heard by one who Is near
the signal post and the drooping sema
phore rises and extends its arm over
the trackâ an emphatic gesture which
means "this block is occupied â stop in
stantly." *' â¢*;.Â¦_ '
The signal mechanism consists of the
electro-magnet, which controls a valve,
a. compressed air cylinder with its pis
ton head arid piston rod, the latter
connected with a lever .which pushes up
the rod that moves the semaphore.
Compressed air is supplied from, the
buried pipe, which brings it ten or
twenty miles from the air compressor.
"When the block is "clear," that is when I
there is no train, car or locomotive on
it. the semaphore hangs down, pointing
groundward. This tells the engineman
that the track irf clear. The semaphore
is held in the "all clear" position by
the compressed air. When a train en
ters the block and short circuits the
current the armature of the de-ener
gized magnet is moved by a spring
opening a valve which allows the com
pressed air to escai>e from the cylinder.
Instantly the semaphore, by force of
gravity, assumes the horizontal or stop
position. ' . j , -
It will be noticed that to hold the
signal at the "all clear" or "safe" posi
tion it is necessary to shove up the
rod which moves the signal. As soon
as this shoving force is released the
weight of the rod and counter balance,
acting on the short arm. of the sema
phore, causes the blade to rise to the
horizontal or "stop" position. Thus
any failure of the current, any leak
la the plpÂ«, any breaking of the actu-
the irresistible tendency of the mind
to construct a rhythm, and the "tick"
was supposed to seem different from
the "tock." simply because it came on
the down beat. But Dr. Kosenbach of
Berlin, after vainly consulting the
clockmakers, set himself the problem
to solve, and found that the action of
the mechanism Is snich that the cogs
of the escapement wheel do not strike
the arms of the "anchor" in precisely
the same way. "Tick" comes at the
right, with the cog rising: "tock" at
the left with the cog descending. The
result Is that "tick" is more sharply
accentuated (louder?) and of shorter
duration, while "tock" is higher in
pitch. With this differentiation the
source of the universally felt double
rhythm is apparent. Yet it is none the
less true that by an effort of the will
the rhythm can be reversed, and the
accent put on either beat at will, and
with a Htle practice most people can
hear the ticking of a triple rhythm. â
Springfield Republican.
THE Democratic House leader is Mr. John Sharp
â¢ 'Williams, a very able man. Because he has ability
and can think, he is seeking to find an issue be
tween the two parties upon which a campaign can be
made. He makes an authoritative statement in one
of the February magazines, which we hope will be
widely read, for it discloses an interesting, perhaps a
perilous, condition in American politics. He is cyi-
J dently of the opinion that letting the water out of the
j trust stocks has taken the wind out of the trust issue.
His conclusion is that there is ground for an. issue in
j the tariff, but that free trade is a chimera. " Therefore,
! we must have a tariff for revenue only. -It is popular
i in the South to advocate taking the excise taxes' off
I whisky and tobacco. Indeed, Mr. Blaine and Mr. Ran
dall a-greed on that policy, and the South had many a
pang when it opposed. Blaine, for he had nearly captured
I that section by a policy that would transfer taxes from
excise to imposts. , ,.
This would have put all the production of revenue
upon the tariff. The South has long had that policy up
its sleeve, and every Democratic leader from the South
who makes tariff for revenue only an issue" keeps an
eye upon the possibility of satisfying the business in-
I terests of his section by so reforming the tariff as to
make it even more protective than now". So \\t have
Mr. Williams saying: "The tariff reformer ' who would
< do things recklessly or too suddenly : would run the
j'risk of destroying the very- end which' he had in con
templation by furnishing an object lesson which would
not help but hurt him."
Still he advises thei party to seek power on the issue of
tariff reform. Now if such reform is to furnish an object
lesson that will hurt those who do the reforming, is the
object sought a public benefit? The implication is that
j the object lesson will injure the people, who alone can
j hurt a party by voting it out of power. It is true that
I he qualifies by naming reckless or sudden action as
dangerous, but since the same object is sought, whether
j the action be prompt or deliberate, the time schedule
does not affect the result. If the. protective feature of
the tariff is wrong, in morals and .politics, as 1 Mr. Bryan
insists, it should be destroyed without delay, and the
only object lesson would be beneficial to the destroyers.
Mr. Williams is plainly under restraint from the pro
tection sentiment of the South. ' In explanation of his
position he continues: "I have always thought that there
ought to be about every tariff a degree of flexibility, a
maximum and' minimum â a margin within which, by
international trading and bartering, the friends of un
trammeled, or comparatively untrammeled, commerce
could be rewarded for the admission of our^farm and
mining products free,, or nearly free, encouraged in
their course and others encouraged to imitate it; and
whereby also, incident to the rewarding of these, peoples
pursuing an inimical course toward our commerce could
be punished. They could not complain, because they
would not be punished directly, indeed punishment would
not be the end in view. They would be punished by
their' own act, and their punishment would be remitted
by their own act."
While his statement is turgid, one gathers from it
that he wants a tariff for revenue only, so framed as to
rise and fall automatically with the imposts of the coun
tries with which we trade. It is a Democratic substitute
for the McKinley plan of reciprocity. But reciprocity
leaves either protection or revenue in our own control.
The Williams plan would lose, us -the control of either.
In the administration of his pjan the Secretary of the
Treasury would have to order customs office'rs to reduce
the duty on products from any country in proportion to
its reduction. on ours. It is thinkable that under such a
plan Congress might adjourn and go home leaving an
automatic tariff in force to provide revenue, when the
nations with which we trade, desiring to get at our,
market, would let us into theirs free or so nearly
free that our self-acting tariff would not yield enough
revenue to pay the cost of an extra session to take its
automatic flexibility out of it.
Candidly, we put it to the country, is there enough
in this idea of a tariff to make an issue and warrant
a thoughtful citizen in voting for the party that proposes
it?- Beyond this Mr. Williams has no policy upon which
to invite votes except that a Democratic interstate com
merce bill would give th* Interstate Commerce Com
mission the right to fix all railroad rates. That right
can be given, but it can never be exercised, as no com
mission could ever be appointed capable of such a stu
pendous task. A close reading of Mr. Williams leaves
the impression that; after all, his main reason for mak
ing a campaign at all is that his party is "out" and wants
to get "in." In such a reason the people have no inter
est "\vhatevcr.
Fire Protection.
"These are sociable times back of
the scenes when the performance is
on," remarked Stage Manager Ferris
Hartman of the Tivoli. "The ladles of
the chorus never received such gallant
attentions during their working hours"
as has been thrust upon them nightly
since the Chicago holocaust occurred."
"That speaks well for the courtesy
of their masculine' coworkers," was
suggested.
"Oh, there has been no notable en
hancement of their Chesterfleldian
lam," said Mr. Hartman. "They have
no time for lah-de-dahing while the
show Is in operation. It's the visit
ors â our unbidden guests â I allude to.
There was a time when no male crea
ture could pass the stage doorkeeper
unless he belonged to the house, but
now It's different. Any man who can
flash a badge may enter with im
punity, stay as long as he pleases and
do pretty much as he desires. It Is
really affecting to see the deep solici
tude for the safety of theater perform
ers and audiences manifested by al
most every branch of the municipality.
Every inch of the Tivoli stage has
been inspected time and time again by
members of the Board of Supervisors,
members of the Board of Public
Works, members of the Fire Commis
sion and members of every other old
organization that has anything to do
with the city government, and time
and time again the stage has been pro
nounced as well protected from flre
as it possibly could be. But still they
come to obtain new information from
the chorus ladies. They don't seek
knowledge from me, probably because
I'm rude."
"Have you had any trouble with
them?"
"Once. A gentleman with a large
and luminous cigar stuck in his face
flashed his badge, entered and began
to interview a lady of the chorus,
when I mildly reminded him that
smoking was not allowed on the
stage. 'Do you know who I am?' he
angrily demanded, and flashed the
badge. "Without waiting to inspect the
nickel-plated shield and not knowing
whether he was Mayor Schmltz's seal
bearer or the driver of a scavenger
wagon, I plucked the burning brand
from his mouth, chucked it into a flre
bucket and replied. 'No; but I know
who I am.' â¢ He didn't strike me, but
I don't know what might have hap
pened if there had been no ladies
present."
IS THERE AN ISSUE?
atlng mechanism of. the signal allows
the force of gravity t~ come into play,
brings the signal to '.'danger" and holds
every train standing until some one
discovers the break and repairs it. "
The system Just sketched out is the
electro-pneumatic system, and the sig
nal is the semaphore. On a number of
roads, however, the dlskjis the favorite
for automatic signals. It is worked
entirely by the power of the electro
magnet, requiring no- compressed air.
The disk is made of silk, whichis tautly
stretched on a ring. The ring is bal
anced on a pivot and all are contained
in a strong case mounted on a post.
The case has glass slde.Â«. When the
block is clear the electro-magnet lifts
the disk so that it is entirely hidden in
the upper part of the case, and its ab
sence, showing the white interior of
the case, signals "all clear." An en
tering train short circuits the current,
the di.Â«ks drop and. showing through
the glass, give the "stop" signal.
In another system the signals are
worked by electric motors contained in
boxes at the bottom of the posts. In
wells, near the posts, are storage bat
teries, which supply the current to act
uate the motors, and the storage bat
teries are charged by the dynamo in
the central plantâ perhaps miles away.
There are two signals for each block
mo-anted on a single post; the top sig
nal is called the "home" signal, the
bottom is called the "distant" signal.
When the ?igrnals are semaphores the
"distant" signal is fish-tailed; that is,
deeply notched at the outer end. The
electrical connections are such that
when a train enters a block the "home"
signal comes to the horizontal position,
the "distant" signal remains 'pointing
downward. This indicates that the
block is occupied by a train, but that
the next block ahead is clear. When
the train leaves the first block and en
ters the second the "distant" signal of
the first block flies to the "stop" posi
tion, as does the "home" signal of the
second block, and the "home" signal of
the first block falls to safety. This in
dicates that the train has left the first
blc.^k, but is still in the second. When
the train leaves the second block both
signals of the first block show that tfre
track is all clear for two blocks.

Reports have been received from the counties about
K6s Angeles. There are about 1500 head of cattle about
Pomona apart from those on the Chino ranch. Hard

In other districts there are several thousand head of
cattle and feed is scarce in all directions and may be
come scarcer. , â¢Â¦
At Downey the conditions are better than at some
other points, there being in the neighborhood fifteeen
miles of ditches from which. water may be taken for irri
gating. The water in the San Gabriel Valley has been
running lower than usuaj at this time of the year. Of
all the localities near to Los Angeles Compton is re
ported to be the best prepared. There barley* is being
cut for hay. On the cattle and, sheep ranges a large loss
is probable. The cattle are crowding\back to the farthest
canyons and h'igher. hills. There are' in Ventura County
from ten thousand to twelve thousand cattle on the
ranges and twenty thousand sheep.

The opinion of the City Attorney
will be anxiously awaited, as it will
affect a large number of teachers that
was assigned to classes and continued
to teach after having served two
years without any further formal ac
tion by the board. A case in point is
that of Mrs. Reeves, who, Director
Roncovieri claims, was never elected
a regular teacher in the department,
but was only assigned to a class after
appointment as a high school substi
tute to be paid only for actual ser
vices. Mrs. Reeves now produces a
letter, dated February 11, 1897, in
forming her that she was elected a
regular teacher.
Mrs. Reeves called on Roncovieri
yesterday to answer the charge of
Mrs. T. J. Stanton that she owed her
5102 for a board bill. Mrs. Reeves
produced a receipt signed "Mrs. Stan
ton, per Abbott," showing that she
paid Abbott $102 for board and
lodging on September 18, 1902. Ab
bott was Mrs. Stanton's agent at the
time, while she was East, and the re
ceipt clears Mrs. Reeves of any at
tempt to evade payment of the bill.
AFFECTS MA.VY TEACHERS.
Now the board will meet the two
factions on the scene 6*f operations at
45 Joost avenue, Sunnyside, in an. en
deavor to pacify all parties concern
ed, so that the object of giving better
school facilities to the Sunnyside pu
pils will be attained without further
opposition.
The Board of Education has re
quested City Attorney Long for an
opinion as to whether the mere as
signment of a teacher to a . class is
equivalent to her election to the de
partment. When a teacher is assigned
it is made subject to a probationary
period of two years. The board be
lieves that a formal resolution elect
ing the teachers must be adopted af
ter the probationary period has been
served. Some teachers, however, con
tend that the fact that a teacher has
served two years* probationary- term
without charges having been filed
against her is sufficient to make her a
regular teacher in the School Depart
ment.
When the other faction in the dis
trict learned that work had been
stopped it visited the board and pour
ed out the vials of its wrath jigilinst
those that had opposed the new
school building and thereupon the
board, somewhat disgusted, ordered
the work of transforming: the hall into
a schoolhouse resumed. - -
The work was then reluctantly
stopped by the Board of Education,
although the new classrooms would
have been a substantial Improvement
over those now used for the purpose.
The new rooms are light and airy and
are 22x36 feet," whereas the rooms
now used are only 12x25 feet in area,
OTHER FACTION* OPPOSED.
The residents of the Siinnyside dls
trfct are anxious to secure better j
pchool aceommodnlions for their ;
children from the Board of Education. !
but they are divided as to the proper
location for a schoolhouse.
As a. result of a visit of inspection'
made by School Director Boyle the
board decided to -rent a hall on Joost >
avenue, a short distance away from j
the present schoolhouse on the same I
street. The owner of the hall agreed;
to expend about $300 in .building \
three rooms in the hall, together with
all the appurtenances required in
every well regulated schoolhouse.
In return for Iheowner's agreement
the board promised. to take a lease on
the premises for at least two j'ears at
$25 a month. \v"ork was commenced
on the building, but the opposing: fac
tion of the residents ..filed a strong
protest against having the school
house on the. location named, on the
ground that It was too far away from
their homes and should be more cen
trally located.

"Our association will protest strong
ly," said Mr. Stulz. "We have affiliat
ing members in "eighty-nine cities and
towns in California. They will all pro
test. We shall probably send a letter
to the Merchants* Association urging
opposition to a measure that would
take from this coast millions of dol
lars that would go to Eastern depart
ment or catalogue houses that do not
pay rents or taxes in California."
Mr. Stulz said that he was surprised
that the Merchants' Association of this
city had paid so much attention to the
parcels post measure through the
agency of the publication issued
monthly by the associÂ«Uiyr;. Mr. Stulz
also argued that there was no fairness
In applying the experience of the Brit
ish Government with the parcels post
to show what might take place in the
United States?, as the conditions differ
largely. Great Britain's population is
more dense than is the population of
the United States. The distances in the
United States over which packages
would be carried would be much
greater than those over which parcels
travel in Great Britain.
COMPARISON'S ARE UXFAIR.

the bill would enable these two cata
logue houses in the East to save in
postage about 20 cents on each copy of
a catalogue. That means that they
would save more than $500,000 a year.
They are the people who would profit
by the parcels post law.
"To have their wares delivered at
places in the United States distant
from the point of departure, the East
ern department stores propose to pay
just a little more than it would cost
a local merchant to send his goods
from his store to a residence in his
home city. Associations of merchants
all over the country are protesting
against the unjustness of the bill in
this regard. We realize that we must
face the competition of a great com
bination of capital. This we could do
under some circumstances, but we can
not get out millions of catalogues.
When the United States Government
pays the freight for the Eastern de
partment store- we will be unable to
compete further.
SUSPECTS RIVALS.
Not long ago a -branch of the Postal
Progress League was organized in this
city. Arguments were addressed to
tho^e In attendance. The retail grocers
take a different view of the proposition.
Joseph A. Stulz, the president of the
California State Grocers' Association
and also vice president of the National
Retail Grocers' Association of the Unit
ed States, last evening defined the at
titude of the local retail grocers.
The state Grocers* Association of Cal
ifornia has, through the action, of its
board of directors, placed itself in op
jKÂ»Â«Jtion 'to the parcels post bill. Some
days ago- the loca! association of. re
tail grocers adopted resolutions against
the bill. Last evening a set of Â¦ con
demnatory resolutions was adopted by
the State Grocers' Association. Forms
of circular letters that will be sent out
to all associations of retailers 'in thÂ«
State have also been adopted. There are
several organizations that are not af
filiated with the grocers. They have
a large membership, among them being
bodies of hardware men and druggists.
To each of these it has been decided
to send a request to join in action with
the retail grocers and to send letters
to representatives in Congress and Sen
ators from this State to urge opposition
to the bill in question.
As the vessel intended ' to sail on
Monday morning Cognet said he woifld
like the Judge to make an order that
the vessel be not allowed to leave the
port, for he desired the captain and
some of the sailors as witnesses for
the defense. Â» ' *
The Judge said that the witnesses
who had been subpenaed were under
the jurisdiction of the court and he
would make an order that they- be in
court at the next calling of the case.
If the vessel sailc' and they did not
appear in court they would be guilty
of contempt and he would see that
they were brought back and punished.
Cognet expressed himself as satisfied.
District Attorney Byington asked
for a continuance till Monday morn
ing. It was granted and all witnesses
were ordered to be in court at that
time.

terday morning Attorney, Cognet asked
for a contiunan^e because his asso
ciate counsel, Colonel Eddy, was un
able to be present." lie. then renewed
his contention that the court has no
jurisdiction.'.;./^ . \
The Judge paid there had not been
a sufficient showing for a continuance
and ordered the Jury to bÂ» impaneled.
Cognet rose from. his seat to leave, but
the Judge ordered him to ' remain.
Cognet refused to ask' the jurors any
questions and said he would refuse
to cross-examine the witnesses. The
Judge replied that . he would look
after the interests of the defendant
and after'the jury had been impaneled

sailors.

After a careful consideration of the
records the court declares, as main
tained by, the authorities of Madera,
that the boundary line between the
two counties runs north instead of
south of Mount Lyell.
Mariposa was made a county by the
act of 1850. It included at that time
what are now Hadera, Tulare. Kern,
Merced and Fresno counties. Madera
County was carved out of Fresno Coun
ty in 1833. The court had therefore to
decide what was the mutual boundary
line of Fresno and Mariposa counties
prior to 1833.
The controversy between the coun
ties of Mariposa and Madera in rela
tion to the position of their mutual
boundary line was decided in favor of
the last named yesterday by the Su
preme Court. The strip in dispute was
about thirty miles long by six miles
wide. \ -^

The opinion of the City Attorney
will be anxiously awaited, as it will
affect a large number of teachers that
was assigned to classes and continued
to teach after having served two
years without any further formal ac
tion by the board. A case in point is
that of Mrs. Reeves, who, Director
Roncovieri claims, was never elected
a regular teacher in the department,
but was only assigned to a class after
appointment as a high school substi
tute to be paid only for actual ser
vices. Mrs. Reeves now produces a
letter, dated February 11, 1897, in
forming her that she was elected a
regular teacher.
Mrs. Reeves called on Roncovieri
yesterday to answer the charge of
Mrs. T. J. Stanton that she owed her
5102 for a board bill. Mrs. Reeves
produced a receipt signed "Mrs. Stan
ton, per Abbott," showing that she
paid Abbott $102 for board and
lodging on September 18, 1902. Ab
bott was Mrs. Stanton's agent at the
time, while she was East, and the re
ceipt clears Mrs. Reeves of any at
tempt to evade payment of the bill.
AFFECTS MA.VY TEACHERS.
Now the board will meet the two
factions on the scene 6*f operations at
45 Joost avenue, Sunnyside, in an. en
deavor to pacify all parties concern
ed, so that the object of giving better
school facilities to the Sunnyside pu
pils will be attained without further
opposition.
The Board of Education has re
quested City Attorney Long for an
opinion as to whether the mere as
signment of a teacher to a . class is
equivalent to her election to the de
partment. When a teacher is assigned
it is made subject to a probationary
period of two years. The board be
lieves that a formal resolution elect
ing the teachers must be adopted af
ter the probationary period has been
served. Some teachers, however, con
tend that the fact that a teacher has
served two years* probationary- term
without charges having been filed
against her is sufficient to make her a
regular teacher in the School Depart
ment.
When the other faction in the dis
trict learned that work had been
stopped it visited the board and pour
ed out the vials of its wrath jigilinst
those that had opposed the new
school building and thereupon the
board, somewhat disgusted, ordered
the work of transforming: the hall into
a schoolhouse resumed. - -
The work was then reluctantly
stopped by the Board of Education,
although the new classrooms would
have been a substantial Improvement
over those now used for the purpose.
The new rooms are light and airy and
are 22x36 feet," whereas the rooms
now used are only 12x25 feet in area,
OTHER FACTION* OPPOSED.
The residents of the Siinnyside dls
trfct are anxious to secure better j
pchool aceommodnlions for their ;
children from the Board of Education. !
but they are divided as to the proper
location for a schoolhouse.
As a. result of a visit of inspection'
made by School Director Boyle the
board decided to -rent a hall on Joost >
avenue, a short distance away from j
the present schoolhouse on the same I
street. The owner of the hall agreed;
to expend about $300 in .building \
three rooms in the hall, together with
all the appurtenances required in
every well regulated schoolhouse.
In return for Iheowner's agreement
the board promised. to take a lease on
the premises for at least two j'ears at
$25 a month. \v"ork was commenced
on the building, but the opposing: fac
tion of the residents ..filed a strong
protest against having the school
house on the. location named, on the
ground that It was too far away from
their homes and should be more cen
trally located.

"Our association will protest strong
ly," said Mr. Stulz. "We have affiliat
ing members in "eighty-nine cities and
towns in California. They will all pro
test. We shall probably send a letter
to the Merchants* Association urging
opposition to a measure that would
take from this coast millions of dol
lars that would go to Eastern depart
ment or catalogue houses that do not
pay rents or taxes in California."
Mr. Stulz said that he was surprised
that the Merchants' Association of this
city had paid so much attention to the
parcels post measure through the
agency of the publication issued
monthly by the associÂ«Uiyr;. Mr. Stulz
also argued that there was no fairness
In applying the experience of the Brit
ish Government with the parcels post
to show what might take place in the
United States?, as the conditions differ
largely. Great Britain's population is
more dense than is the population of
the United States. The distances in the
United States over which packages
would be carried would be much
greater than those over which parcels
travel in Great Britain.
COMPARISON'S ARE UXFAIR.
'"President Roosevelt in one of his
speeches is reported to have said that
in their contests with the trusts all the
people had a right to expect was that
tho cards would not be stacked. If the
Government carries the freight for the
Eastern department stores at a yearly
loss the cards are stacked against us.
The parcels post bill, as we view it.
is a combination of the big Eastern
newspapers and the Eastern depart
ment stores to put the 300.000 retail
merchants of the country at a disad
vantage. If was introduced In the
House of Representatives by W. R.
Hearst."
"We believe the movement," he said,
"to be the work of two large New
York catalogue houses, each of which
pets out a million catalogues a year.
These catalogues weigh, on the aver
age, four pounds each. The terms of
the bill would enable these two cata
logue houses in the East to save in
postage about 20 cents on each copy of
a catalogue. That means that they
would save more than $500,000 a year.
They are the people who would profit
by the parcels post law.
"To have their wares delivered at
places in the United States distant
from the point of departure, the East
ern department stores propose to pay
just a little more than it would cost
a local merchant to send his goods
from his store to a residence in his
home city. Associations of merchants
all over the country are protesting
against the unjustness of the bill in
this regard. We realize that we must
face the competition of a great com
bination of capital. This we could do
under some circumstances, but we can
not get out millions of catalogues.
When the United States Government
pays the freight for the Eastern de
partment store- we will be unable to
compete further.
SUSPECTS RIVALS.
Not long ago a -branch of the Postal
Progress League was organized in this
city. Arguments were addressed to
tho^e In attendance. The retail grocers
take a different view of the proposition.
Joseph A. Stulz, the president of the
California State Grocers' Association
and also vice president of the National
Retail Grocers' Association of the Unit
ed States, last evening defined the at
titude of the local retail grocers.
The state Grocers* Association of Cal
ifornia has, through the action, of its
board of directors, placed itself in op
jKÂ»Â«Jtion 'to the parcels post bill. Some
days ago- the loca! association of. re
tail grocers adopted resolutions against
the bill. Last evening a set of Â¦ con
demnatory resolutions was adopted by
the State Grocers' Association. Forms
of circular letters that will be sent out
to all associations of retailers 'in thÂ«
State have also been adopted. There are
several organizations that are not af
filiated with the grocers. They have
a large membership, among them being
bodies of hardware men and druggists.
To each of these it has been decided
to send a request to join in action with
the retail grocers and to send letters
to representatives in Congress and Sen
ators from this State to urge opposition
to the bill in question.
As the vessel intended ' to sail on
Monday morning Cognet said he woifld
like the Judge to make an order that
the vessel be not allowed to leave the
port, for he desired the captain and
some of the sailors as witnesses for
the defense. Â» ' *
The Judge said that the witnesses
who had been subpenaed were under
the jurisdiction of the court and he
would make an order that they- be in
court at the next calling of the case.
If the vessel sailc' and they did not
appear in court they would be guilty
of contempt and he would see that
they were brought back and punished.
Cognet expressed himself as satisfied.
District Attorney Byington asked
for a continuance till Monday morn
ing. It was granted and all witnesses
were ordered to be in court at that
time.
for trial in Judge ; ,Cook's court yes
terday morning Attorney, Cognet asked
for a contiunan^e because his asso
ciate counsel, Colonel Eddy, was un
able to be present." lie. then renewed
his contention that the court has no
jurisdiction.'.;./^ . \
The Judge paid there had not been
a sufficient showing for a continuance
and ordered the Jury to bÂ» impaneled.
Cognet rose from. his seat to leave, but
the Judge ordered him to ' remain.
Cognet refused to ask' the jurors any
questions and said he would refuse
to cross-examine the witnesses. The
Judge replied that . he would look
after the interests of the defendant
and after'the jury had been impaneled
lie cross-examined the" witnesses, all
sailors.

After a ppny has been grounded in

Invariably puts on the ' fihishing
Th.e pride of the cowboy is to have
a pony which can *'turn on a 10-cent
piece," The illustration shows some
thing akin to this, a pony galloping
around a polo mallet, a remarkable
test of agility.
The ponies most in demand are
those which have been "hackamore"
trained by cowboys and which have
been used on the cattle range for a
year or so. They soon learn what is
wanted of them when driving cattle
and will then follow any object, stop
ping and starting at great speed.
These ponies could be purchased a
few years ago for *35. They have
been so eagerly sought, however, that
persons liaving them now know their
value and demand ?200 to $300 for
4hem. This is not an extravagant fig
ore, as the $35 range pony often be
comes the 51000 polo pony_ in the
bands of expert handlers.
.It takes long and careful prepara
tion to bring a pony up to a game, al
though there have been cases where a
pony has been played after a few days'
practice. Xine months or a year is
considered a reasonable time in which,
to develop a pony. The first work is
done with a "hackmore," a halter
like affair, usually made oj hair. This
presses on the sensitive part of the
pony's nose and jaw and teaches him
to stop suddenly and " with* but t little
jar to his rider. Some authorities in
sist that a martingale should be used
in conjunction with the "hackamore,"
while others claim it interferes with
â¢the work of that instrument. â¢;

â¢ The polo pony is usually a chance
animal, few persons breeding to secure
the required size and other qualifica
tions. The first necessity is that the
pony be not rrore than fourteen and a
half or. fifty-eight inches in height at
the shoulder. This animal â¢ must be
capable of carrying .men v.eighing from
150 to 200 pounds at race horse speed
for a Quarter of a mile.
On a fast track at Oakland the horses
will usually run the rtrst quarter of a
mile, with tiny jockeys up, in twenty
four seconds. Walter McCreery's pony
Prince, an Undersized descendant of
Wlldjdte. has covered a quarter mile
in 24*i seconds with 1S2 pounds in the
saddle. The Burglingame Country Club
men are better mounted this year than
at any time in the history of the game
and are always on the lookout for
promising ponies.
' To play the game properly at least
four ponies are required in eich. match.
A player usually has one or two fa
vorite ponies which he will use in two
period?. These extend over, ten min
utes at play- Six periods are played
in all matches. The following list gives
an idea of the ponies owned by the
prominent polois-ts ol the Burlingame
Club: .
ing and sensational game of polo has
made in popular favor on this coast
has created a demand for high class
jponi^s which cannot be supplied It
is said every promising pony west of
the Rocky Mountains is shown to H.
W. Kike or the other men who supply
the poloists with their mounts.
not enough time remained to equip and

The secretary's report read., at .the
annual meeting of the California Yacht
Club showed that there are on its roll
the names .of 197 members,, ,five- of
whom are honorary. The following of
ficers were, ele'eted to. serve, the club
during the coming year: Commodore,
George M. Shaw, owner of the yacht
Idler; vice commodore, Charles P. 'Doe,
owner of the schooner Challenge; sec
retary, F. P. du Brutzj treasurer,
Julian Altendorf, owner of the yawl

er of the sloop Catherine; C. E. Clark,
owner of the yawl GypsJe, and George

Frances; treasurer, J. J. Sherry. Of
the foregoing George M. Shaw, Charles
P. Doe, Julian Altendorf, J. .J;- Sherry
and Charles E. Clark were re-elected to
the offices filled by. them last year.
The regatta committee consists' of A.
Vekander, owner of the yawl . Mabel
A; William McBain, who' was secre
tary during 1903. and W. H. James.
It seems there will be a keen contest
for the office of Commodore of . . the
San Francisco Yacht- Club. . The can
didates are A. C. Lee. the present vice
commodore, and \V. G. Morrow, owner
of the sloop Challenger. It was at' first
supposed the contest would be confined
to the candidates for commodore,' ' but
the opposition ticket includes the
names of WV "W. Wilde, candidate for
the office of recording secretary, -and
of W. W. Farrar, candidate for the of
fice, of treasurer. It is practically im
possible at the present time to -esti
mate the strength of the rival parties.
During the year forty-nine members
were lost bv resignation,- expulsion or
death, but fifty new members .were
tlected. The membership list .-rontains
the names of 255 members, of whom 222
a.ie acii\e, twenty-nine absent and four
are honorary. The fleet includes forty
three sIoods. eight yawls and three
launches. During the past year the
total receipts of the clu6 were $1708, and
its total expenses were $3143. There-is
on hand a cash balance of 5912, an<l
$645 is due from members, making the
total assets of the club more than $1500,
with all bills paid. A . â¢ â¢â¢
In response to a question by ex-Com
modore Carl Westerfeld with regard, to
the amount spent on the sloop Corin
thian, built by. the ciub for the purpose
of challenging for the San Francisco
Perpetual challenge, cup,, now held .by
the San -Francisco Yacht Club, ex-Com
modore John W. Pew said -that the
sloop had cost up to the' present $3309.
She was finished, before the close of
List season, but was not. launched,: as
thian Yacht Club, held on Wednesday

When the Golden Gate Club chal
lenged the California Club about three
weeks ago to a nine-team doubles
match the members of the latter club
paid little heed to it. The California
Club ' men, thinking their opponents
would have little or no show of carry
ing off the honors of such a meeting,
did not take the matter seriously. It
has since developed that the park play
ers consider their chances of winning
are good.^
The park players make a mjstake In
conceding the first four matches to
their opponents. The first match will
go to the 1 California Club surely. In
this the Baker brothers will be opposed
to MacGavin and Allen. The second
match will likewise go to the California
Club. The doubtful matches are the
third and fourth. The California Club
men expected to be represented by
either Tobin and Taylor or Mitchell and
Collier as their third team. It is doubt
ful if Taylor will play. In this case his
place will be taken by either Sherwood
Adams or R. T. Crawford.
The opposing teams in the fourth
match will be Janes and Russell and
Drs. Hill and McChesney. â¢
Two tennis tournaments of import
ance will.be played on the California
Club courts to-day and to-morrow.
This afternoon the mixed doubles
handicap will be completed. To-mor
row the first interclub match between
the California and Golden Gate Ten
nis clubs will be played.
Four teams are left in the mixed
doubles event and with'the handicaps
allowed some . good matches should
result. The fact .that they are,thÂ»
teams playing from the lowest marks
shows the poorer teams were not giv
en, large enough; handicaps. In the
upper half Miss Mary Ratcliffe. and
Frank Stringham will meet Miss Bes
sie Valleau and Herbert Schmidt. The
latter will receive the smallest pos
sible odds â "owe 1-6." This handicap
will cut no figure in the outcome, as
Stringham and Miss Ratcliffe go, back
"15'J once every six games. The teams
are about evenly matched and a close
game is expected. Miss Ratcliffe and
Stringham are slight favorites. This
is undoubtedly due to the fact that
Miss Ratcliffe is stronger at the net
than Miss Valleau. Stringham and
Schmidt are about evenly matched.
In the lower. half the best teams in
the tournament are opposed to each
other and a battle royal will result.
Miss Ethel Ratcliffe and" Dr. Sumner
Hardy are "15 2-6" back .of scratch,
while Miss Hotchkiss and Will Allen
are "5-6" behind. Miss Ratcliffe and
Dr. Hardy will "owe 15" every. other
game. VThis. handicap is thought to be
about right, although in a" practice
match last Saturday Miss Hotchkiss
and Allen beat their opponents an
8-6 set. Hardy is. playing about as
well as ever and is .much stronger
than Allen. On the other- hand, Miss
Hotchkiss is considered by many a
better player than Miss Ratcliffe. It
is expected the winner of this match
will carry off the tournament honors.
Play will be called promptly at "5:30.

"I feel just as fresh as when
I entered the ring," said Eddie
Hanlon after the battle. "Broad
never worried me and I knew
just as soon as I got a line on
his style that victory awaited
me. He did not land one effec
tive blow, and. as you can see,
I haven't a scratch on me. He
butted me with lils-'liead in the
sixth round and that made my
eye bleed for a while. He is the
gamest man I ever met and
when he was all but out he
'stalled' and said such funny
tilings that I had to laugh. 1
can say without boasting that I
fought the best battle of my ca

HANLOX: OUTCLASSES BROAD.
The fight between Eddie Hanlon and
Kid Broad last night in Mechanics' Pa
vilion came to an unexpected end dur
ing the minute's interval between the,
fourteenth and the fifteenth rounds.
Broad had been taking an incredible
amount of. punishment for several
rounds and he had weakened notice
ably under the' battering," but he was
game and came up each time with a
do or die look in his face.
When he went to his corner at the
end of the, fourteenth round Tim Mc-
Grath, who was seconding him, ad
vised that he allow his seconds to toss
a sponge into the ring, signaling that
he acknowledged defeat. Broad
averse to this at first, but as the next
round was about to i begin he agreed
and the., fight ' was stopped. He had
It announced that in the limited time
he had for training he could not get
into condition, but that he went as far
as his strength would carry him.
The spectators did not understand at
the moment what was going on In the
ring, it had all been done so quietly.
There were murmurs of discontent ' at
first, possibly from the men who had
bet on Broad, but tfiese were quickly
drowned by the applause for Hanlon.
Tim McGrath, who has had wide ex
perience as a second, saw Broad had
â¢no possible chance of recuperating and
it was a^ humane act to stop it when
he did and end the unnecessary pun
ishment.-- - : . â¢
Round 7 â Hanlon went in after Broad and
the latter tried to work In his tight uppercut
several times, but they were all blocked. Haa-

with left to the face and Broad swung his
right to the ear. A left swing by Hanlon
went around Broad's head and they came to
& clinch. Hanlon did some clever blocking.
Broad's blows for the face rarely landing.
Hanlon hooked bis left to the face and sent
Broad Into his (Hanlon's) corner. Hanlon
followed his advantage by driving his right
and left hard to the body. Breaking from Â»
mix- up Hanlon put In three hard rights to
the kidneys. He followed with two wicked
hooks to the stomach and the bell rang. Han
lon had all the better of this round. He land
ed apparently at will.

ach. A mix followed. Hanlon again placing

to Broad's body. <
Round 5 â Broad riissed a left swing for tnÂ»
Jaw and received two swings in return on thÂ»
face. Hanlon kept J/orcing his man about thÂ»

Round 2â Broad Jabbed left to the face.
They again mixed it and Broad staggered Ed
die with a straight right to the body. Broad
kept up a running conversation. In another
mix Hanlon drove three hard . rights to â¢ the
Kid's kidneys which made the â¬Heveland boy
wince. Hanlon lunged out . with right and
left and - caught Broad on the ribs. .They
went at it hammer and tongs. Hanlon pepper
ir.e Broad's stomach and body, while the lat-
"Round 1â Broad waÂ» first to lead. He was
short with left for the head and then they
mixed It. . both hammering viciously at each
ether's body. Broad finally swung hla left
hard to the ribs and followed It with & left
high on the head. Hanlon missed a straight
left for the Jaw. Hanlon kept himselr covered
well. . but It . waa noticeable that he had
changed his tactics considerably over his prev
ious fights. Hanlon forced Broad . into a neu
tral corner and' planted right and left hard to
the body. Hanlon tent bia right to the kid
neys and a moment later a well directed left
caught ' Broad on . the face. Hanlon protected
himself well. They fought hard In a -mix-up,
both grettlng rights : to the body. Hanlon.
however, had the better of It. The bell rang
at this stage. Hanlon had a shade the better
of the round. ..,
The following is a description of the
Kanlon-Broad fight by rounds as seen
by an expert at the ringside:
Fight of Light w eights by Rounds
Tells Story of Broad's Defeat.
HAXLOX ASSUMES EARLY' LEAD.
The attendance was light, thjere, be
ing long rows of vacant seats visible
in both the gallery and the main floor.
Broad, whose face is a huge joke,
kept Hanlon busy listening to his wit
ticisms for a time. As he began to tire
his funny remarks came less frequently
and gradually stopped. He tried to
laugh near, the end of the fight, but his
face would not respond to his desire
and the effort was a failure. His lips
were puffed and he had a generally
battered up appearance.
Hanlon had a much fresher appear
ance than when he met Young Corbett
and looked considerably heavier than
his opponent. He was in excellent con
dition, although his punching powers
must be on the wane or he would have
stopped Broad in the earlier stages of
the contest. /
Hanlon was seconded by Harry Fo
ley, Billy Delaney, Fred . Landers and
Toby Irwin. Broad had Tim McGrath,
Cyclone Kelly and Billy "West ' In his
corner. There was a hitch over the
question of a' referee, but Broad finally
agreed to Gregrgains. Jimmy Britt and
Young Corbett were the only celebrities
presented to the spectators. Both were
warmly greeted.
BROAD'S FUNNY FACE.
Broad got a right and left to the body
early in the opening round, which
seemed to take whatever steam he had
out of his blows. For the first five
rounds there was no sting In them anJ
Hanlon took one occasionally when he
saw a chance to give a harder one in
return.
fornian's marvelous defense was in evi
dence throughout the contest. His
arms shed most of Broad's blows, few
getting inside his defense. Broad
butted him over the left eye in the sen
sational sixth round and the wound
bled freely for a time. This gave him
a ghastly look until his seconds stopped
the flow of blood. Broad tried repeat
edly to open the wound, but without
success.

very pleasant afternoon at the races.
He negan with a $1000 wager on Scots

_On Friday. January 22. Young Pep
Â£er started in a race and the three-year

NOTES OF THE TRACK.
Favorites agrain had a hard row to
hoe. Bay Wonder standing: out as the
h ;ie successful one. The longest
priced winner was Gawaine, a 9 to 1
shot. The weather was warm and the
track lightning fast.
<5olden Light, from the McCafferty
barn, closed favorite over Jlimo and
Scotsman for the opening sprint, but
received such "a meek, mild ride that
hÂ«? finished third. Mimo went to the
pqst lame and in a hard drive Jack
Martin, on Scotsman, outfinished
KÂ«jnz, beating him half a length.
Colonel Roosevelt started for the first
time in many moons and. fairly well
backed at S and 10 to 1, broke down.
A softer sr>ot could not have been
found- for Bay Wonder than the Fu
turity course run following. As good
as even money could be had about the
Texas bred sprinter and he won gal
loping from Bell Reed and Modder.
Turgrette did his usual stunt out in the
lead 1 for five furlongs and then retired.
There can't be two Chickadees, for
th<Â» one starting In the mile and a
furlong event yesterday was labeled
same as the one that lined up a few
days' ago, only blessed with more
Kpo.ed. If there are two Chickadees
somebody didn't forget to set the coin
in on this Chickadee the second, for
the price fell from 4% to 1 to 18 to 5.
This is not startling, but for the fact
that Mr. Dinsrle and Searcher were
weH played. Foley rode Chickadee,
an* leading from start to finish,
do\vn#d Billy Moore in a drive. Mr.
Dinsrle ran a fair third.
Otto Worderly and Dick Turpin
jiM'v. J the ruination of bettors who fa
vor, short-priced ones, in the three
yoar-old event at Oakland yesterday.
Â¦VYonderly is ono of the fashionable rid
ers of the East who has played in all
.^orts <jf ill luck hero, such as breaking
stirrups and falling off horses, and
Dk-k Turpin is a very speedy colt from
â¢New York ftate. The distance to be
run was six furlongs, and as the ad
mirers of : Turpin predicted he would
cover the distance in 1:12%. if neces
sary, everybody wanted to hold a
pasteboard on him. and were accom
modated by the bookmakers at the
ratio of â¬ vrrsus 5. To the amazement
Â«>f all. Young Pepper, a 30 to 1 shot,
:ook the track away from the favor
ite and actually outran him all the
way. At least YVonderly dropped in
behind the outsider, thinking: no doubt
he could pick up the pace when ready.
Everybody gets fooled once in a while,
ind at the wire Wonderly and his
mount finished third. Bell, who ap
1-ears to have regained his Ingleside
form, rode Toledo in the race. It was
tie first appearance on any stage this
reason of the Burns & Waterhouse
co":. but his friends did not let him
run loose. The odds were forced down
from 34 to 2 to 1, and as Youngr Pep
|fer tired Bell dropped along with To
ledo, winning by almost a length in
1:1?, Bill -Curtis, the "Los Angeles
Hindoo," was a starter, and, outfooted
during the early part of the race, fin
ished a useful fourth.

With five clubs in existence in the
State, the next step Twill be to form an
association. The Paciflc\Coast Scottish
Bowling Association with five " members
to start with would soon number two
or three times' that many. It is possible
that within the year the first coast
championship willhave^ been decided.
Several championship .tournaments
have " already ; been held, but j they have
been : confined to San v Francisco. ; The-
San Francisco and Oakland clubs have
met in "competition twice and
times the honors have gone to the local
Sacramento, San Jose and Saratoga will
all have "greens" in the near future.
J. Reynolds, an enthusiast from Sac
ramento, visited the rinks at Recre
ation Park last Saturday in search of
information as to the laying out of a
green in his city. Mr. Reynolds in
formed the, bowlers that there are many
Scotchmen' in the capital f city who are
eager to play the game they learned
as children, "'he visitor was taken in
hand by Y. C. Lawson/ the president
of the club and one of the most enthu
siastic bowlers, and when he reached
home he undoubtedly knew all that was
necessary to start a Scotch bowling
club. ' Mr. Lawson premised Mr. Rey
nolds the .support of the club. -It was
agreed that interclub matches would
be arranged as soon as the new ' club
had got fairly started: "
The ancient game of Scottish bowls,
or "bowling on the green," as it i3
called in Scotland, bids fair to become
one of the most popular of the many
outdoor recreations that are indulged
in all the "year round in this State. The
game was started less than a year. ago
by a few enthusiasts in, this city. The
local club, known as the San. Francisco
Scottish Bowling Club, has thrived be
yond the expectation of even the most
sanguine and now boasts of a mem
bership list.reaching almost a hundred.
On this list are. the names of some of
the most prominent "men in the city,
and, strange to say, many of them are
neither .from Scotland nor of' Scotch
parentage. : â¢Â¦Â¦' . .
Oakland soon followed the lead of San
Francisco, and a club was . organized
acfoss the bay. t It has . been In exist
ence'but a few'months, but its growth
has also been rapid: 'Last .Week it; de
veloped that three other cities -in the
State' are about to . form ' clubs,", and it
.is expected there will be five; clubs on
the coast in the course of a few weeks.
It is Expected Members of Five Clubs
Will Be Playins the Game
Shortly.

marked/ improvement in their play last
time. t
Arrangements are being made to
start a fine "green" at Saratoga. The
new rinks *will be ..formally opened
when the electric road which runs
through Lx>s Gatos is extended to Sara
toga. There are many enthusiasts in
San Jose who are anxious to form a
club, and they will undoubtedly follow
the lead of Sacramento and Saratoga.
Scottish is a game that rec
ommends itself particularly to men past
the prime of life. It is a mild form of
exercise, that has enough competition
to make it interesting. The fact that
it is played on well-kept grass amid
pleasant surroundings also makes it a
popular and healthful recreation.
The new green at the park is almost
in condition to be played upon, and the
green at Recreation Park, which Is not
good, will not be used more than a
week or two longer. When the new
green is. opened tournament .play will
be resumed, and the doubles and sin
gles events, for which the drawings
have already been held, will be played.
In the meantime, the crack players will
practice on the old green.
Rafael used his left to advantage
for the next four rounds. He was
ever Quick to take advantage of ' an
opening and was wont to catch Welch
off his guard at short intervals. Welch
did not seem to get wise to his oppo
nent's style and. was puzzled through
out the battle.
The "Spider" did not seem to show
his true saeed till the seventh round.
Then both boys began to mix It fu
riously all over the ring. Welch
landed many solid wallops on Rafael's
body and the latter was in distress at
the end of the round. He began to
hold on* at every chance and stalled
till the end of the bout. : "
The next three rounds were tame
and both boys seemed to be fighting
cautiously. Welch made many fierce
rushes at his opponent, but the latter
managed to get out of the way. Welch
was rushing him hard when the last
round ended. Referee Greggains im
mediately threw both hands in the
air, signifying a draw.
Joe Reilly won from Billy Sullivan
in the other preliminary go. Both lads
mixed it furiously as soon as they got
started, and at times each -was all but
t out. The last round was a fierce mix
up and Reilly finally put Sullivan to
the carpet with a" right to the jaw.
Sullivan had enough and decided to
stay on the, floor.
the middle of the second round^ Rafael
landed a pretty right short jolt in the
middle of the solar plexus that put
Welch dowrt as quick as a flash.

v Under ordinary | circumstances a
small boat would have had short life
In that sea. The Bartlett's mates,
however, were both old seal hunters
and consequently skilled boatmen.
"With lusty but careful strokes they
pulled the tumbling dingey to where
their shipmate's head was bobbing up
and down in the water. The donkey
man was unconscious when pulled
into the dingey and had not recovered
his senses when hauled aboard the
schooner. Stimulants and heroic
massage brought him to, however, and
the next day he returned to duty none
the worse for his ducking.
He lost consciousness soon after
striking the water. In putting on- his
sou'wester he had buttoned the flaps
under his chin. These flaps held the
sou'wester securely and the' air im
prisoned in the roomy crown of the
waterproof headwear supported the
-tlonkeymsn until his. rescuers-reached
him.
The Bartlett, now at Redondo, left
the Columbia River January 15. Three
hours after the tug: had let go of her
a terrific gale was encountered. Cap
tain Nielsen ordered everything dou
ble reefed and all hands responded to
the command. In .the â¢ midst of the
work of shortening: sail the Bartlett's
donkeyman was washed off the jib
boom and disappeared in the swirl of
tempest torn water.
The 'cry "man overboard" rang out
above the rattle of gear and the roar
of the wind. The schooner was head
ed into the wind and all eyes searched
the wake for a sign of the man In ex
tremity. The donkeyman was clad
in sea boots, oilskins and sou'wester
and his chance in that boiling sea was
slim. He was sighted, however, and
without a moment's hesitation the
first and second mates climbed into
the dingey and within a few minutes
had the little boat launched and were
pulling: to the rescue.
A thrilling rescue was effected Jan
uary 15 off the Columbia River by the
first and second mates of the schooner
R. "W. Bartlett. The skill and bravery
of these men is all that saved a ship
mate from death by drowning, but
even the prompt action of his rescu
ers would have availed little had not
the air imprisoned in a tightly but
toned sou'wester buoyed him up' after
consciousness had left him. \,
Details of the rescue came yester
day in a letter to Captain James
Bruce, owner of the schooner, from
Captain F. V. Nielsen, the vessel's
commander. Captain Nielsen fails to
give the names of the participants in
this ocean drama.

"Spider" Joe Welch and Frank
Rafael hooked up in the main prelim
inary of the night and went ten rapid
rounds to a draw. Rafael did most of
the aggressive work, but the few
punches the spider landed had their
effect, and when the gong clanged at
the end of the battle the dark-skinned
youth was about all in.
Rafael was in great condition and
put up one of the best fights of his
career. His footwork was fast and he
landed frequently with his left. .In

two rights to the stomach and followed it with
two left hooks to the jaw that sent th; Cleve

weak, with stocks of all grades of Navels
heavy. The large sizes of Navels, say 9Gs and

stock commanded a premium. There was a
good demand in the auction rooms for large
fruit tor shipment to Honolulu, but the bidding
for the small and medium sized fruit was slow.

only seven boxes of 96s brouzht the top quo

Another car of "Western .Poultry was mar
keted, making the sixth for the current weÂ«k,
including one carried over from last weÂ«k.
There was quite a; quantity of both Western
and domestic 'stock "left over from the pre
ceding day and the , market was dun. with
nearly all retailers heavily supplied. Prices of
chickens had no quotable change, but several
dealere were making liberal concessions in order
to effect sates. Dressed Turkeys were lower
under liberal supplies and a slack demand.
Poor and grassy stock was offering freely below
the minimum quotation, but' found few buyers.
Receipts of Game were light, but prices were
no higher, as all dealers were anxio#s to
clean up.

CHICAGO, Jan. 29. â War rumors caused an
advance of *lc to:i%ciin the price' of .wheat
to-day. Part of the advance" was lost on proflt
taking. but the close was firm, with May %@
%c higher than yesterday's final figures. Corn
closed with a gain of %@\lc f or . May. â¢ Oats
are up "ic. Provisions are unchanged. -.
"A sharp bulge- occurred 'in wheat at the
openlntr, due to reiKirts that the crisis In the
Far East was not far distant. These reports
were given emphasis by higher prices in for
eign grain markets. Opening quotations here
showed May %c to lvsc higher . at DO^c.to
91Uc, with July lc to lVfce higher at 62%c to
83c. Buying orders came largely, from shorts.
For a time there | was ; little wheat on the
market. The leader of the -. longs, - however,
took the selling side toward the . end of the
first half . hour, and was joined by smaller
holders, with the result .that prices declined
about from the high point, May steadying
around 90%c and July at 82Tic. The market
lost its energy .and ruled 'comparatively dull
the remainder of, the day. Long wheat con
tinued to come out on all small upturns,* but
the demand was equally good on every re
action. The market was hetoed by Argentine
strike news, small receipts 'and an improve
ment in cash demand in the Northwest. May
closed, at 9054690*4 c. after it had sold down
to 00%c. July finished at 83S83^c.'
The influences which governed - the wheat
market were factors In the corn nit " After
opening '/iÂ©94c higher at 50Hc to 5OÂ«ic May
sold between 50c and OO^ic, closing at '50 Â»-iW
60Â»sc. Local receipts were" 215 cars."
Oats were strong throughout the entire day.
May opened Â»4Â©%c higher at 42?fc@42i4c sold
between 42%Â«42%c and 43c, closing It 43o
Local recelcta were 74 cars. â¢
Packers were moderate sellers of provisions
and there waa further liquidation of i ar d by
bull houses. In spite of this selling and In the
face of lower prices at the yards, the market
yielded very little, closing practically at yes
terday s prices. Buying by commission-houses
and shorts on the' strength of grain was the
main supporting feature. May pork and lard
closed unchanged and ribs were a shade

The Supreme Court has decided in a
suit instituted by Teresa Bell against
Attorney Lucius Solomons to secure
possession of a parcel of land adjoin
ing the property on which the late
Thomas Bell's house stands that the
lawyer may remain in possession until
he Is paid a sum equal to moneys ad
vanced by him with interest, and that
he must then deed the . .c-perty to the
plaintiff and the other equal owner.
Mary E. (Mammy) Pleasant gave Sol
omons $11,000 with which to buy the
property in dispute. He -subsequently
advanced $6200 to Mrs. Bell and $1000
to Mammy Pleasant, keeping the lot
as security. The transaction took place
shortly after the death of Thomas Bell
and while Mammy. Pleasant was the
apparent manager of the deceased cap
italist's estate. ;T7.:.
The dispute arose later when Mrs.
Bell claimed that her . former servant
had acted as her agent and had . no
persc-nal rights in the property involved.
Solomons claimed that the debts of
both Mrs. Bell and Mammy Pleasant
must be paid before lie would have to
surrender his interest In the lot. â¢.

the-.church, delivered an interesting ad
dress*, on' mission- work 'In the northern
part of California. , She eloquently told
of - the, hardships - to be endured and
gave her hearers a unique opportunity
of learning of the many sacrifices made
by the earnest women who labor for the

Bishop Nichols paid a high 1 and affec
tionate tribute to the memory of the
late BishoD Kip, and spoke of the pe
riod when he first arrived in California
as' rector of Trinity Church.
Bishop Nichols compared that day
and the succeeding days of ... Bishop
Kip's- life when he alone was Bishop
of California with the great meeting of
eighty Bishops in that Sunday-school
room of Trinity Churcn in 1901. From
that room, said Bishop Nichols, had
been appointed during that memorable
convention BlshoDs of Porto Rico of

he said, achieved in that room of Trin
ity want out far into the* worjd' as of
the 'greatest and widest importance. â¢
Then Bis'hop Nichols paid a; tribute
to American- womanhood., and' in doing
so gave tender thought to Mrs. Maria
Kip and spoke of her, influence, in the
work of the church, and her labor of
love for * California. Great work;, said
the Bishop,- was often done in silenceâ
a silence in keeping with the .beautiful
growth" of the earth that caine.of silent
force. The ,' silence: of woman's work
in the church of: God is eloquent, said
the Bishop, and the silent work of the

The time had come, said > Mrs., Law
ver, when women should not be afraid
to ask for large sums toward their
work:. She had noticed that they sel
dom had courage to go to the wealthy
woman to ask for a large giving.
There was also need in auxiliary for
good needlewomen. Mrs. Lawver com
plimented the Alameda women for the
earnestness of their work and for their
getting together in numbers never be
fore known.
Mrs. Lawyer, in a concise report,
spoke of the needs of women's work?
Mrs. Lawver considered that' women
should have a larger "understanding of
auxiliary work. She believed; in the
Bishop's auxiliary fun,d, that he might
make appropriations as lie thour'it
best. H ". ' J-
The delegates to the meeting were

FIRST BISHOP OF. CALIFORNIA.
AND EPISCOPAL CLERGYMAN
WHO DELIVERED SERMON.
While the automobile people were de
liberating over what action they should
take Grayson was having trouble at
the Palace over the check He had cash
ed there, and was finally compelled to
seek lodgings elsewhere. When the au :
tomobile representative sought Grayson
at the Palace the young man had dis
appeared.
" Late last night it was learned that
Grayson had obtained temporary quar
ters at the Windsor Hotel, where it is
expected that the holders of his checks
v. :i locate him this morning .and de
mand a settlement.
Grayson arrived here three, days ago
from' Portland and at bnce began to
cut a wide swath about town. He had
considerable money at the start, and
flashed it about in a reckless manner.
He developed a sudden liking for auto
mobiling. and began .hiring machines
to carry him around the circuit of frolic
and fun. Finally he concluded that it
would be cheaper for him to purchase
an automobile outright than to pay the
price of hire. Accordingly he visited
thÂ« Mobile Company and there se
lected a machine and handed to Man
ager Hartigan a check on Wells, Fargo
& Co.'s Bank for $2250, the price settled
upon between them for. the vehicle.
As Grayson is a novice at .automo
biling. the manager of the concern sug
gested that, before undertaking to run
the machine himself he should make a
few trial trips under the direction of a
chauffeur, a proposition the young
man readily accepted, and ten minutes
later Grayson and a man were park
ward bound on a trial trip.
Returning to the city, Grayson order
ed the chauffeur to take him to his ho
tel, and the machine was sent back to
the automobiling repository, arriving
there just as a clerk returned from the
bank with Grayson's check marked "no
funds." :-t" ,'";",->
John T.. Grayson, son of a wealthy
mining man of Portland, who has been
staying at the Palace Hotel for several
days, has got himself nto a lot of trou
ble during his short but exciting so
journ' in this city.
Yesterday afternoon when he re
turned to the hotel he found the door
of his room locked against him, and
a protest' made at the office /of the
hostelry brought the prompt response
that he would no longer be a welcome
guestâ at least not until he had made
good the amount of a' check ; he had
drawn upon a local bank and cashed
at the hotel. It developed later that
other checks bearing the words "no
funds" were outstanding against Gray
son, and that the holders were seri
ously contemplating having the young
man arrested. '"â¢</*' ;
When he first secured a position with
the firm his salary. was $50 a month,
and in view of his excellent work he
received two ..advances,' making ' his
salary $100 a month at the time his
peculations were discovered. Accord
ing to one of the members of :the firm
it was the firm's intention to increase
his^ salary $50 on February 1.
Armand was taken before Captain
Martin and made a confession. He at
tributes his downfall to the racetracks.
Armand, who is but 25 years of age,
has bÂ»on in' the employ of the firm for
several years and Â¦ was looked upon as
one of the most trustworthy
men in the establishment. His em
ployers took such a liking tohim and
believed so implicitly in his honesty
that he was given the position of pay
ing clerk -in the various factories ope
rated-by the firm. One of his duties
was to pay off the factory help weekly
and as he kept the cash book he was
able to abstract amounts ranging from
530 to $100 without exciting suspicion.
His method "was V falsify the footings
and only the experting of [the books
brought to light the crime.
It was found that the' peculations of
the young man cover a period extend-,
ing, from November, 1902, to January
15 of . the present year. ..It was. his
habit to take $100 at a time,. but in one
instance He- took $200 and on two other
occasions' embezzled $50.
In an endeavor to beat the races
Arthur Amarid, a trusted clerk of Lev i
Strauss & Co., 14 Battery street, found
that his income was insufficient, and
as the result, of the embezzlement of
$1800 a term in the penitentiary*awaits
him. He was arrested yesterday by
Detective Gibson and his name en
tered on the detinue book' at the City
Prison. ~v
