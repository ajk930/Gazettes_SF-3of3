THE chief damage done by the storm locally was the wrecking of a new seven-story building at Bush and Polk streets and the destruction of the steeple of. St: Paul's Church. Cellars were flooded and shipping in the bay suf
fered slightly. Many Jumses were unroofed, chimneys demolished and two uncompleted flats were blown dozvn. Repprts from the country are meager, but all indicate that outlying districts felt the fury of the storm and low

opened fire upon them. .
Soon after this first approach, dur
ing which many shells were thrown
into the town, a gale sprang up : and
the Japanese moved further off shore.
The weathor soon moderated., how

.On the whole, while the storm has
done some damage, there is a silver
lining to the clouds, as it is of ines
timable value to the growing cereal
crops and will furnish abundant feed
for the cattle on hundreds of hill
sides in the dry, months to come.
While much damage was done on the
bay, the majority of the vessels rode
out the storm in safety, their masters
having heeded the warnings sent out
by the Weather Bureau. Some smaller
craft went ashore and two ferry-boats
suffered slightly, but, on the % whole,
considering the. large amount of ship
ping-in the bay and the fact that a
high sea coupled with a fierce gale was
on for. hours, it can safely be said. that
the damage, was nominal, - and stands
as a splendid advertisement for San
Francisco's great '- harbor â¢ in the face
of unusual circumstances.
' San Francisco did not suffer. alone.

water in case - of an emergency, also
suffered severely.^ The water filled- the
sewers, backed into the gutters, flood
ed cellars and 1 gradually rose to the
first \ floors of dwelling-houses, ruining
carpets arid ! furniture and " driving the
inhabitants to seek shelter, elsewhere.
The storm which broke upon this
city Wednesday anight and raged un
til yesterday noon was one of ' the
most violent in the history of the city
and from a financial standpoint .un
questionably the most disastrous. , The
records of the Weather Bureau show
that the barometric pressure was not
as low by a fractional amount as dur
ing the storm, of 1801, but thie other
records â the records of wrecked build-,
ings and flooded dwellingsâ tell an
other story.
Turn where you may throughout the
city and wreckage of some form is In
evidence, varying all the way from^the
wrecking of a splendid seven-story
building to the tearing of awnings and
blowing In of plate glass windows.
Throughout the night the storm"
raged with increasing violence, strik-"
ing terror to the hearts of the timor
ous. Great buildings rocked on their
foundations as blast after blast of 'the
gale struck them; smaller houses in
unprotected localities . rocked like
cradles, and some, unable to- with
stand tho onslaughts of the gale, col
lapsed.
The greatest pieces of individual
damage were the wrecking of the
Sahlein building, and the collapse of
the steeple 'of St.. Paul's Church. The
Sahlein building, is a splendid seven
story brick and steel structure* in ..the
course of erection at , Bush and Polk
streets. The wind so warped and
twisted it that a portion, if not all of it,
must be torn down and rebuilt. - At
about 6 o'clock yesterday, morning one
of the steeples of St. Paul's Church at
Twenty-ninth and Church streets was*
torn from its concrete foundations and
fell to the ground' with a deafening
crash. i* ;i ~-~. Â¦"Â¦-Â¦

The damage otherwise throughout the
post, while not serious, was general.
A 'great tree fell across the street rail
road track, and for two hours the
cars were prevented from entering the
post.
In the cantonment of the Twenty
eighth Infantry trees and shrubs were
pulled up by the roots. Colonel Pitcher
of the Twenty-eighth said that at onu
period of the. stor:-. he expected at
nny moment to have nis house blown
from its foundations.
Out of this entire upper camp but
two tents are left standing, the others
scattered in all directions. Stoves were
smashed and tossed around the camp
like so much tissue paper. The result
of the fury" of the gale was an abso
lut? and complete wreck. The lower
camp fared somewhat better, as it
was slightly protected by the frame
messhouse. Here, however, several of
the hospital wall tents were torn to
tatters and carried away by the gale,
while a number of the conical tents
were wrenched and twisted beyond
recognition.
The storm of yesterday morning held
full sway at the Presidio, and besides
almost completely demolishing tha
model camp played merry havoc with
trees and fences throughout the post.
It swept with unrestrained fury down
through the old recruiting camp, which
acted like a funne!. It tore past tha
brick quarters of the colored troopers
of the Ninth Cavalry with tremendous
velocity. The greatest damage waa
done to the model camp, the entire
upper half* of which is laid In ruins.
This camp, which had recently been
put Into first-class shape for the re
ception of the Philippine scouts and
the Eleventh Infantry at a cost of
about $3000, presents a sorry spec

floors constructed and the conical wall

PORT ARTHUR, March 10.- â Tlie Japanese fleet appeared off the

o'clock tills morning. The Russians replied to the fire of the Japanese
fleet. A gale in the morning compelled the Japanese to withdraw.

"The commandant of the fortress at Port Arthur" reports that about
1 o'clock tliis rooming the outlines ' of vessels, apparently torpedo
boats, were seen nt sea, within the area swept by our searchlights. Our
batteries opened fire upon these vessels. Our torpedo-boats put out to
pea at 2:40 a. m.. and at about 4 o'clock met the enemy west of the
LJao-tsc-Chin lighthouse. After firing several shots the enemy retired to
the south in the direction of Shandun. Our torpedo-bouts returned to
the harbor at 6 o'clock.
"Later torpedo-boats wero sent to sea to reconnolter. They returned
in a half hour, having learned that an enemy's squadron was approach
ing. _ Â¦.
"At 8 o'clock the Japanese opened firÂ© upon our cruisers and the

â¢"With a creaking of timbers, a groan
almost human and a crash, one of the
lofty spires of St. Paul's Church,. now
in the course of construction at the cor
nor of Valley and Church streets, broke
off just above the line of masonry
about 6 o'clock yesterday morning and
fell . across Valley street, a broken,
twisted mass of wood and metal. Twen
ty feet of the steeple, including the
colossal cross and copper work, lodged
in the yard in the rear of the premises
at the northwest corner of Valley and
Church streets, narrowly missing the
building.
. Thomas "Ward occupies the lower por
tion of this building as a grocery and
bar. The upper floor is divided into
living-rooms, and at the time Mrs.
Ward, three minor children and three
roomers were asleep, entirely, oblivious
of* their narrow escape from death.
â¢In Its downward ' course â¢ the steeple
Just grazed a corner of Ward's building
and the top portion landed in the yard
alongside a kitchen window. Strange to
relate, the window was not broken, and
the only damage done In the store was
the breaking of a bottle of mineral
water, which was jostled off the back
bar. About ten 1 feet of the yard fence
was demolished, but beyond this no
damage was done. .
*.' Ward said he was standing in the
front part of. his store when he heard
a crash. He thought that a shed In the
rear of the place had been blown over,
and ran outside to investigate. . The
street was strewn with wreckage, "and
In the rear yard he found about twenty
;feet of the steeple of St. Paul's Church.
Rev. M. D. Connolly, rector of St.
Paul's Church," said: "Although we
have sustained considerable loss I feel
thankful that no fatalities occurred.
The steeple was one of the tallest and
best constructed in the city, and, as one
well-known contractor who examined
it remarked, 'it had the strength of
Gibraltar.' We did npt anticipate the
storm and. were putting the cross and
metal work in place. Extra heavy scaf
folding had been erected for the work
men, and in order, to allow them to get
to their work it was necessary to loosen
the Iron rods running from the top to
the bottom of the steeple. It is my
opinion that this, coupled with the fact
that the southern exposure of ' the
steeple was open, is responsible for its
collapse: ' The loss will be about $S0O.
and work will be resumed as soon as
possible."
The crash of the falling gplre created
much excitement in the neighborhood,
and many': ran ' from their' homes in
Bcant^attlre. The steeple was 183 feet in
height and . was . surmounted by a six
foot cross. - Upon - investigation it waa
found that no further damage was done
to the* church by the storm.

discharge them. This was accordingly
done shortly after 3 o'clock. Both the
recent suspects left the prison in com
pany with their counsel, Frank Drury.
and in a most happy mood.
One of the leads followed by the po
lice yesterday without result took them
to the junkshop of E. H. Musin at 239
Fourth street. The story was brought
to headquarters that Musin had sold
young Buttgenbach a revolver on Sat
urday. The merchant and his wife
were taken to the Coroner's office, but
failed to identify Albert Buttgenbach
as their customer of Saturday.
Other settlements made by the Clunie
heirs were also announced yesterday.
In open court the attorneys for the
various litigants gave out that it was
agreeable to all that the court should
consent to a distribution to ''Jack'
Clunie of $30,000 and to Andrew Clunie
of $45,000 and the warehouse property
in Sacramento. The petition of the
executors of Clunie's will for a distribu
tion to them of the property left to
them in truBt for "Jack" Clunie is yet
to be decided. It will be heard in two
weeks' time, and it is expected that
when it does come up for hearing all
opposition to the distribution of Clu
nie's estate will be withdrawn.
An the estate stands now Andrew
Clunie's interest Is valued at $180,000,
the widow's at $450,000 and "Jack" Clu
nie's at ?500.000.
Florence M. Clunie, widow of the late
Congressman Thomas J. Clunie, is
$150,000 richer than she would be had
aht. not decided that she would refuse
to accept the portion of her husband's
estate bequeathed to her In his will
and claim a widow's share, which, ac
cording to law, is one-half the estan,
provided that it is community prop
erty. Her attorneys announced yester
day that she had agreed to accept the
amount named in addition to the prop
erty bequeathed to her in Clunie's will
in full satisfaction of all her claims
against the estate. This sum will be
paid to her out of the residue of the
estate, which, under the will, is be
queathed to Andrew Clunie, brother of
the deceased, and "Jack" Clunie. the
adopted son of the Congressman, share
and share alike. Out of "Jack" Clunie's
share she will receive $115,000 and out
of Andrew's the balance, this being the
proportion agreed upon by all parties
concerned. This gives to the widow
about $450,000 out of her husband's
estate.
Griffith took the sentence calmly. He
will appeal the case to the Supreme
Court.

to two years' imprisonment in San
Quentin and to pay a fine of $5000. The
sentence is the extreme penalty pro
vided for the crime of which he was
convicted. In passing sentence on Grif
fith, Judge Smith read a severe lecture
to the defendant. He characterized the
assault as a most aggravated one and
Â¦without excuse, adding that he had
made ur> .his mind when the jury left
the courtroom that in case it returned
a verdict of conviction he would inflict
the extreme penalty.
â¢'A more aggravated case of assault
I have never heard of in an experience
of fourteen years on the bench," said
Judge Smith.

Clippert's evidence supplied the
missing link needed to secure credence
for the story of the crime given by
young Buttgenbach and corroborated
by Brune â the story of two footpads
who assaulted 'the youth as he was
quitting the meat shop and who later
engaged in a struggle with his father.
The police are not satisfied, however,
that it clears Albert Buttgenbach, from
suspicion of complicity. They will
continue to work on the theory that he
may have been in collusion with the
Albert Buttgenbach and Louis E.
Brune are free men. lAfter being held
by the police since Sunday on sus
picion that they had guilty knowledge
of the murder of Joseph Buttgenbach,
the son and the bookkeeper of the
dead packer were exonerated yester
day morning by the Coroner's jury
and a few hours later Chief WJttman
ordered their discharge from the City
Prison. This probably ends the hope
of discovering the authors of the
crime, as the detectives are without
any promising clews for further work
upon the case. Thus another is added
to the long list of unavenged murders
committed in San Francisco. |
This result of the Coroner's inquest
into the death of the wealthy, presi
dent of the Pacific Packing-house was
foreseen from the beginning of the
hearing on Tuesday, but it became a
certainty when a new witness volun
tarily appeared yesterday. This man,
Benjamin Clippert, told the jury that a
few minutes after the fatal shot was
fired on Saturday night he saw two
men run out of ihe vacant lot between
Shipley and Folsom streets and quick
ly vanish in the direction of Fifth
street.
Â¦â¢'. !*W ell," was the reply, 'â¢ "I ; did not
want to run'any risks"; and then he
raised a laugh by adding, "I thought
.those fellows might be friends, of Al
-bcrt's waiting for him."
r-v.The other Important witness of the
day was the new character-, in the
"drama, Benjamin E. Clippert, a clerk
for S. J. Haskins in the Mills building.
His testimony weighs either .. for or
against the new police theory that Al
bert Buttgenbach called in footpads to
rob, his father, but it tends .strongly
to discredit , the original claim that Al
bert had shot the packer. Clippert tes
tified as follows: ".;.â¢ * '
It was about 10:20 to 10:30 o'clock. I cannot
say to the dot, because I do not carry a watch.
I was solnp down Fnlsam street to Fifth. I
stopped to see a friend in that block between
jranrih and Fifth street*. When eoinÂ« toward
ThenY came ; the two witnesses who
did-most'to? produce -the jUry's exon
eration of the Buttgenbach boy. The
first was. his uncle, Lorenz Weber, fore-"
man in the factory, who retold how he
was leaving the place by the Shipley
street ,'dqcT at 10 o'clock, when he saw
two men standing down the south side
walk' v of that dark street, thirty feet
frorri-the door. The honest' appearing
German was not to be disbelieved, even
though he contradicted himself later
when Coroner Leland demanded an ex
planation of his failure to investigate
these suspicious characters.'
This theory, sensational as it seems,
Is the only one left the detectives that
Implicates the boy at all. They are
quite willing to admit that their orig
inal hypothesis (that the son shot the
father) fails to fit the evidence
at hand. They are not quite willing,
however, to admit that an entirely in
nocent man could have acted as Albert
Buttgenbach did act, even according to
his own story, on the occasion of the
crime. The young man will be watch
ed. But the murderer of Joseph Butt
genbach, whoever he was, will not be
hanged with a rope of theories, and
the detectives, hard as they have
worked, are still a far cry from the
faots out of which to build a criminal
indictment that will stand the strain
of a jury trial.
The hearing yesterday was largely a
rehash of the familiar story already
told many times by the police and their
few witnesses. Henry Heide, proprie
tor of the saloon adjoining the packing
house, and Frederick Moennich, his
bartender, related the events surround
ing and following the shooting as seen
by them at the saloon. It took Heide
only "eight seconds" to run out of his
place and reach the iron gate stretched
across the open front of the meat shop.
He saw no one within, and to his
shouts of "Louis! Louis!" no response
was made. He was immediately re
called to the saloon by the cries of
M&enhlch for the police. .-.Moennich'e
testimony accounted for these cries by
saying that only a few seconds after
the shooting he heard some one kick
ing Jn the partition at the rear of the
room and ran out into the street at

Greene reached the scene promptly and
arrested young Buttgenbach as he

not reslBt a hold-up and that a consid
erable' sum of money might thus be
seized, to be" divided later between the
robbers and hims^Jf. r
SOX STILL SUSPKCTED.
After the verdict was announced a
long conference was held by Chief
Wittman, Captain Martin of the de
tective force and Detective Ryan as to
what should be donerf with Albert Butt
genbach Â¦;Â¦ and Louis Brune.. It was
finally ; announced that the police rec
ognize their lack of evidence on which
to hold the two young men, and would
.We, the Jury, find that Joseph Buttgenbach
came to his death from shock and hemorrhage
due to a cunshot wound, of .the brain at the
hands of party, or parties; unknown. I And wÂ»
further find : that ~ there it no evidence to im
plicate -Albert Buttsenbach and Louis E.
Brune, and we hereby exonerate them from
all blame or eusnlcton. -
Coroner Leland then briefly charged
the jury, taking occasion .in the course
of his remarks to compliment Detective
Ryan very highly on the thoroughness
and love of Impartial justice he had
shown in investigating the case. It
then took 'the jury just fifteen min
utes to return the following verdict:
VERDICT QUICKLY FOUND.
All the police and detectives who
have worked on the case then followed
with their accounts of what they had
seen. The only new point brought out j
was -strongly in favor of young Butt
genbach's hold-up story. Policeman
Krueger told how he had picked up |
Albert's hat from the floor of the shop '
near, the Shipley-street door. The hat
was crushed and dirty, as if it had
been trampled on.
Drs. L. D. Bacigalupi and C. F .Miller
described the results of their examina
tion of the wound and of the
autopsy. The last piece of evi
dence was . the exhibition of the
dead man's watch and' fob. From
the* fob, it was 'stated,, a charm
had been twisted, apparently during
the supposed scuffle between Buttgen
bach and the footpads, and it was
.found hanging by a single strand im
mediately after the shooting. This was
another bit in favor of the hold-up
storv. . â¢ ' *i Â¦Â¦.-Â¦':
had been a murder,
At the conclusion of Cllpperfs tes
timony he was sent with Detective !
Coleman in search of the woman ha j
had referred to, but they failed to dis- !
cover one who had seen the two men j
running away Saturday night. j
Frank B. Connolly, a grocer, whose ,
shop is just above the packing-house, j
testified to seeing a small man run- j
nlng ud Fourth street immediately af- j
ter the shot rang out. He admitted, j
however, that this "man" was probably j
none other than the well-grown lad,
Stephen j Slavich, who testified on
Tuesday.
NICHOLS TOOJt HIS TIME.
Jean Nichols, who had told the po
lice that he watched the Shipley-street
door of the factory an instant after
the shot was fired, went on the stand
and took, it all back. He had been feed
ing his horse, he said,- in the little
stable across the way when he heard a [
noise. He did not recognize it as a

Discovery of a Case of Peon
age in Mississippi Likely
to Cause Some Trouble
The announcement was made yester
day of the appointment of A.- D.
Schindler, superintendent of Valley
division of the Santa. Fe ro'ad, to the
position of manager of the ' California
Northwestern Railway, "to takÂ£ effect
on April 1. The position has just been
created by President A. "W. Foster, but
whether it will be a permanent one is
yet to be determined. It was stated
yesterday that General Manager H. C.
Whiting of the California Northwestern
will soon retire and that Schindler will
assume his duties. In fact- it is gener
ally understood that Manager Schind
ler's appointment presages a number of
other changes, which have been under
consideration by the directors of the
road for a number of months. General
Manager Whiting has been with the
California Northwestern and its leased
line, the San Francisco and North Pa
cific Railway, for twenty-nine years.
Of late his health has not been of the
best and this fact, it is said, has had
much to do with his contemplated re
tirement from active service in the
near future and the appointment of a
manager for the road.
Manager Schindler has been identified
with the San Joaquin .Valley division
ever since it was built. He was for
merly assistant to Engineer Storey,
who constructed the line, and when the
latter was turned over to the Santa Fe
and Engineer Storey was transferred to
Topeka. Schindler was retained as su
perintendent, with headquarters at
Fresno. As a railroad man he is re
garded very highly by the officials of
the Santa Fe Company, General Man
ager Wells stating last evening that
his road was losing a very competent
man. He is a clever engineer, an inde
fatigable worker, a great disciplinarian
and a man who prides himself on his
methods of organization and "the main
tenance | of the properties that are
placed in his care. He is a graduate of
the State University and widely known
throughout ; California. Â£jfj
Much speculation was indulged.! In in
local railroad circles yesterday* as to
who would probably succeed to the po
sition of superintendent of the San
Joaquin Valley division of the Santa
Fe, but this question was Â«ettled last
evening when General Manager Wells
announced that Schindler would be
succeeded by J. W. Walker, at present
superintendent of terminals on the
western system of the Santa Fe, and
that Walker's place would be filled by
J. L. Dunley. now assistant superin
tendent of terminals. Schindler and
Walker are at present In this city and
were In conference yesterday with
other ofilcials of the Santa Fe road.
SPOKANE, Wash.. March 10.â Rev.
R. L. ' Cartwright, pastor of thÂ«
Christian church at Milton, Or.,
fought Otis, Ingle," organist of the
church and president of the Chris
tian Endeavor Society, and got the
better of the fight. Rev. Mr. Cart
wright handed in his resignation, to
the board of elders a short time before
the mixup. Not daunted by a large
scantlfng" wielded by the stout young
Christian Endeavorer, the pastor
smote his antagonist with a rock,
closed in on him and as the layman
fell to the ground held him in a vise
like grasp and struck him, after which
Dr. Ditterbrandt rushed from his
home and separated them.
At the termination of the combat
Rev. Mr. Cartwright walked to City
Recorder Tolen's office and voluntarily
paid a $5 fine. Ingle, however, swore
out an assault and battery warrant
and the minister had* to go before
Justice of" th*e Peace John Miller, who
fined him $10 and costs. This proba
abiy closes the incident in a legal way.
but the breach in the Christian church
is yet to be healed. :
Bad feelings have existed for more
than two. months between Ingle and
his pastor.. Ingle is a harness-maker.
The trouble arose over the preacher
remonstrating with the harness-maker
as to his conduct. In a moment Ingle
practically called the minister a liar.

ground Rev. Mr. Cartwright made for
him. Ingle backed away and picked

Monday.
Reputable white citizens of Kemper
County brought this case to the atten
tion of the marshal, asserting to him
that the negro had been stripped and
whipped for leaving the premises of
those who held him. So severe was
the beating that his clothing stuck for
several days to the gashes made by
the lash. On his second escape it is
alleged that he fled into Nessobald
County, where he was recaptured; pis
tols were drawn on him, a rope' was
placed around his neck and fastened
to the saddle of one of his captors and
he was dragged and driven into Kem
per County.
According to a Tientsin correspond
ent of the Standard the Russians are

troops from Port Arthur to Harbin

cendiary origin, destroyed or damageJ
six -buildings and caused a loss of be
tween $."0,000 and $40,000. All of the
fires were within a radius of fifteen

efforts on the part of the firemen that
a greater conflagration was prevented.
At the first fire, in the Olive-street
stables, at 62S Olive street, thirty-two
head of horses were burned 'to death.
The flames spread from the barn to an
adjoining lodging-house and for a time
imperiled the lives of the inmates.
-The second fire was in the Kratz Mill

BUILDINGS IN THE
WESTERN ADDITION
The southeaster which broke over the
harbor Wednesday night and ripped
and roared in fierce blasts of anger
until late yesterday morning made
playthings of big ships, wrecks of
wharves and loaded the outgoing tide
with flotsam that collected and piled
would have overtopped Mount Tamal
pais.
A number of small vessels foundered,
some were driven ashore. With these
exceptions the damage, although gen
eral, was not particularly serious. Few
vessels that were in the harbor, either
at anchor or moored alongside the
wharves, but show some bruises. In
some cases plates will have to be re-
placed. Ship carpenters and riggera
will be busy for many days and the
Harbor Commission repair department
has ahead of it a huge task of patch
ing.
From Meiggs wharf to Hunters Point
the storm's track could be traced by
broken wharves and damaged vessels.
Bits of scow schooners and barges, rail
road ties and scraps of crushed boats
dotted the waters of the harbor and
industrious beachcombers reaped a
rich harvest of firewood.
A summary of the damage done to
shipping reads like a report from Port
Arthur after a Japanese business call.
The navy training schooner Ernest
was torn from her anchorage off Yerba
Buena and driven high and dry on the
beach. She was damaged considerably
and will cost Uncle Sam a pretty pen
ny, considering her diminutive propor
tions, to put into shipshape again.
The ship Eclipse, at Greenwich street
wharf, carried away her moorings and
drifted on the bark Edward May, car
rying away the latter's martingale and
cathead. The Eclipse had her wheel
house carried away and sustained other
damage.
The steamer Berkeley, leaving Oak
land at 6 a. m., had her coal gangway
doors stove in, but temporary repairs
were made and the boat continued on
her trips. The steamer Oakland, while
making her trip from this side of
the bay, had one of her life boats lift
ed out of its davits by high seas, which
carried it away, and the force of the
wind blew in her two main sliding
doors and broke several windows on
her storm side. The steamer Transit
also had her share of trouble, for a
schooner drifted down into the out
part of her berth and pinned the big
carrier firmly into her dock.
On the Key route the yellow paint
ed boats persisted in voyaging across
the bay and they, had a merry time in
LIVERMORE, March 10.â One of the
worst storms that Livermore Valley
has ever experienced broke at 1 o'clock
this morning. At times the wind- blew
at the rate of seventy miles an hour.
In all directions buildings have been
blown down. Wires are down every
where.
Anspacher Bros.' grain warehouse
No. 3 collapsed at 7 o'clock this morn
ing and 10.000 sacks of barley were ex
posed to the drenching rain. Most of
the grain will be a total loss. A large
crew of men was put at work to move
the barley, but little progress was made
owing to the storm. The loss will be
$15,000 at least. 'Â¦ ;
Peter McKearny's barn on K street
was destroyed this morning. The barns
on the May ranch were blown dowa
and several horses, we're killed. ThÂ«=
wind was highest at daylight. Then
it eased off and a torrent of rain 'fell
for several hours, during which John
Callaghan'8 residence was unroofed.
Roads into the hills are all blockaded.
Communicayon is cut off.
GRAIN WAREHOUSE
AT LI VERM ORE IS
TOTALLY DESTROYED
The storm while in its fury, during j
the early morning hours wrought havoc J
along the various lines of railroads i
throughout the State and for a num- ]
ber c-f hours there was almost an ab- j
solute cessation of operations. To make ,
the predicament of the transportation j
companies more aggravating, their tele- i
graph lines were blown down and the j
only means of getting information as I
to the exact amount of damage and
providing necessary means for repair
ing the injuries sustained was de
stroyed.
For several hours during the morn
ing the Southern Pacific Company's
only telegraphic communication was
between its uptown offices and those
at Third and Townsend streets and the
Oakland mole* The local officials of
the Santa Fe Company were meanwhile
experiencing similar obstacles. Final
ly, in the afternoon, after much hard
work on the part of repairers the com
panies began to get reports that
promptly suggested to them that it
will be several days before the operat
ing systems will .be again in proper
order.
From every, quarter came news of
washouts, landslides and caves that de
layed trains leaving and due in this
city. It was reported by Chief Clerk
Montgomery of Manager Agler's offices
that while the Southern Pacific Com
pany had much to contend with in the
way of storm accidents, none of them
were of a very serious nature and
would be repaired as fast as they could
be reported and men sent to the scene.
All trains were late, but the company
was endeavoring to move them as fast
as possible.
Even the company's service between
this city and Oakland and Alameda
was badly demoralized and could only
be operated irregularly until late in the
afternoon. At 6 o'clock In the morn-
Ing it was found that it would be im
possible to run trains over the Ala
meda line owing to the fact that a
temporary building had blown down
and obstructed the roadway. Through
traffic over this line from San Jose
and Santa Cruz was finally effected by
way of Alameda Point.
On the California Northwestern Rail
way system landslides were reported
along every branch of the road and
these, with the rising waters, delayed
traffic. The train from Santa Rosa, due
at Tiburon at 8:45, did not reach the
latter point until 1:45, and then
the belated passengers suffered
further. delay owing to the
fire aboard the steamer Dona
hue, which necessitated her putting
back. A report was issued from the f
company's office last evening, however,
that the blockades had been raised and
that the entire road would be in good
shape for business this morning.
Landslides were also numerous along
the North Shore road, but they were
trivial in character and the majority
cf the company's trains ran on pretty
good time. The roughness of the bay,
however, prompted the company to tie
up its boats during the early part of
the day, which was regarded by many
as a wise move.

The ship Oliv^bank, at the Risdon
Iron Works, tore out her chocks and
carried away her moorings. She was
badly damaged by being jammed

On the first trip of the Oakland the
forward lifeboat Â¦was torn from the

by a heavy roller that swept aboard
during the steamer's plunging.
In Oakland harbor a lively sea was
kicked up. Many ships and other
craft went adrift, doing more or less
damage.
Throughout the cities trees were up
rooted, fences and signs, awnings and
small structures were mowed down.
The Street Department was flooded
with reports of clogged sewers" and
overflowed streets. No breaks oc
curred that caused serious damage.
The storm played havoc with the
telephone lines in Oakland. Manager
Eugene J. Ellis said 2000 instruments
were put out of commission. The cable

The rainfall for the storm, up to 1
o'clock this afternoon, was 2.42 Inches,
making a seasonal total of 22.19 inches,
as against 17.95 the corresponding date
last year.
Along the water front the storm was

OAKLAND, March 10.â With a wind
storm that at some localities in Ala
meda County reached a velocity of
seventy miles an hour, rain accom
paniment being as comparatively
heavy, >the gale that broke over the
State last night worked a full measure
of damage along the east shores of San
Francisco Bay and left Its mark
throughout Alameda County. Oakland,
Alameda and Berkeley were given a
lively shaking up and reports from
down country points note heavy dam
age by wind and rain.
The Llvermore Valley was hard hit
and losses are serious from the gale
that wrecked houses, barns and other
structures, including one large ware
house, . exposing thousands of sacks of
grain to the driving downpour of rain.
The storm wrecked telephone and tele
graph communication In all directions.
At the Southern Pacific Company's di
vision headquarters it was announced
that reports could not be obtained of
damage done along the railroad oi> that
account. Local train and ferry service
were seriously interrupted during the
morning. Trains and boats were run
on irregular schedules. The "Key"
route ferry was caught by flooding of
the tra*cks In the "subway at the foot
of Yerba Buena avenue. A washout
on the line into Berkeley caused a stop
page of traffic for several hours. Oa
the Southern Pacific narrow-gauge a
washout and flooded tracks along tha

o'clock train from San Francisco was
stalled at the tunnel and did not arrive
at Berkeley station until four hours
later, traffic having been entirely sus
pended. All this time the pumps were
sucking the water out of the subway
as fast as steam could make them, and
a gang of men were doing their best to
drain the tracks of the foot of water
that covered them.

Folsom and Shotwell streets from
Fourteenth to Eighteenth streets were
Impassable rivers and the residents in
the vicinity suffered considerable dam
age. At the corner of Sixteenth and
Folsom streets C. Rassmussen con
ducts a saloon and resides in the rear
with his family. The water and mud
flooded his establishment and home
end yesterday afternoon he was busily
engaged in cleaning the parlor car
pet with a hose. Rassmussen Is bit
ter against the authorities for what
he terms their negligence In not clean-
Ing the sewers.
Passengers tvere unable to alight
from the cars in this section and had
to ride for many blocks beyond their
destination. When the flood Tras at
Us height Patrolman W. P. Dalton at
tracted considerable attention by car
rying two elderly ladies across Fol
som street.
The basement of the grocery store
conducted by Herman Kleen at Six
teenth and Folsom streets was flood
ed to a depth of ten feet and at one
time the water threatened to under
mine the supports of the building.
On the west line of Folsom street
rear Seventeenth are four dwelling
houses about two feet below the offi
cial grade. The water poured into
the buildings and the families upon
awakening were confronted with six
inches of muddy water in every room.
The loss to the tenants, will be con
siderable. They blame the owners,
whom they declare are responsible for
not raising the buildings.' In the back
yards the water was more than two
feet deep.
Captain Anderson of . the {seven
teenth Street Police Station says that
the storm is the worst in his recollec
tion. On several trips made by the
patrol wagon the water was over the
wheels.
A scow belonging to McMahon Bros.
A barn of the City Street Improve
ment Company at Division and Seven
teenth streets also came in for con
siderable damage. A water tank of
large capacity, elevated 100 feet on
truss work in the yard, was covered
with an iron cupola. The wind raised
this cover and deposited it on the roof
of the stable. The structure is a two
story frame building, the upper floor
being used for the storage of hay and
grain and in the lower floor 150 head
of horses are cared for. With a ter
rible crash the roof was crushed in
and the side of the building fell into
the yard, leaving the loft exposed to
the elements.
Almost simultaneously â¢with the de
struction of the steeple of St. Paul's
Church a sixty-foot smokestack on the
Knterprise Brewery, situated on Fol
som street, between Sixteenth and Sev
enteenth, fell with a crash, but fortu
nately did Dot damage any of the ad
joining buildings. The management of
the brewery places the loss at 5400.
Reserve boilers were placed in com
mission and there was no Interruption
to business.
Several schoolhouses suffered Blight
damage, and, the advertising contrac
tors who use the board fences as a
medium of publicity will suffer consid
erable loss, as many hundred feet of
fences in prominent locations are down.
Several skylights on the City and
County Hospital were broken and forty
feet of fence on the Protrero avenue
side of the institution was wrecked.
Many of the sewers throughout the
Mission broke under the great strain
of the flood and in many places the
overflow undermined the streets, caus
ing them to cave in.
On the San Mateo division of the
United Railroads sand washed on the
track kept a force of laborers at work.
A tree opposite the Union Coursing
Park was uprooted and fell across the
trolley wires, causing an interruption
of traffic for some time.
A portion of one of. the steeples of
Ft. Pauls Church, at the corner of
Valley and Church streets, snapped off
like a twig and crashed into a neigh
boring yard, providentially missing a
dwelling-house.
The wind played some queer and
costly pranks in the Mission district,
and property-owners in that section
received an object lesson in the inade
quacy of the sewer system, usual
the vicinity of Sixteenth and Folsom
Ftreots suffered the most, and for sev
eral blocks in that vicinity the streets
took on the appearance of mlllraces.
Ollars were flooded, living rooms con
verted into miniature duck ponds, and
housewives stood in several inches of
water while preparing the morning
meal. The email boy was in his glory
end the many lakes situated through
out the district afforded him an oppor
tunity to put his seamanship to the
test on improvised rafts.
From all accounts the wind and rain
were most pevere about 6 o'clock yes
terday morning and the greatest dam
age occurred about that hour.
The Richmond district encountered
the fierce gale In all its fury. The en
tire district suffered more or less
from the storm and wreckage is every
where scattered along the streets. In
back yards and vacant lots. A three
story flat in course of construction on
Lake street, between Fifth and Sixth
avenues, was completely demolished.
The flats are the property of W. H.
Hendrickson and were being con
structed at a cost of about $S0OO.
Only the foundation and the frame
work had been completed and conse
quently the sale had full headway
when it struck the frail structure.
It fell with a crash some time before
6 o'clock in the morning and timbers
and bricks lay piled up in a tangled
mass on the site. No one was near
the structure at the time it was de
molished. The Police Department was
at once notified.
An inspector from the Board of
Public Works visited the place soon
after it collapsed and pronounced it a
total loss. The structure was being
built by M. J. Savage and was com
menced several weeks ago. The total
loss will probably reach $2000.
A three-story flat building in course
ft construction at Fourth avenue anJ
D street by F. Nelson, 634 Second ave
nue, was badly demolished and will
be a total loss. The two-story flats,
also the property of Nelson, which are
being constructed near his residence
on Second avenue, were also badly
wrecked. Nelson's loss is not great.
Chimneys were blown down all over
the district and windows were broken
all along the route of the storm. In
fact, the entire Richmond district pre
sented a pitiful appearance after the
gale. Wreckage lies everywhere in the
streets and vacant lots.

at last accounts. There was a
break in the storm yesterday
afternoon, but the forecaster
predicts that we shall experi
ence more high wind* to-day,
although probably not so severe
as those of yesterday. More
rain may also be expected.
The maximum wind Telocity
attained yesterday was forty
eight miles an hour. The rain
at 8 o'clock in the morning fell
at the rate of one-fiftieth of an
inch a minute tor three ininntes.
The barometer reading was
29.23 inches when the wind was

of thirty inches. The reading of
February 22, 1891, was 29.10

SHIPS BATTLING AGAINST
THE GALE IN THE BAY AT
SAUSALITO.
The water subsided quickly when the
rain ceased this afternoon, thus free
ing many places for the ordinary traf
fic. In some localities, however, the
flood has left its mark and it will be.
several days before the tide of activ
ities may be resumed.
Eight inches of water covered the
Southern Pacific's tracks at the foot
of University avenue for three hours
this morning and trains were sent cau
tiously across the submerged raiLs.
Men were on hand trying to drain th3
water into the bay.
Among the individual sufferers who
sustained considerable loss are D. E.
Vergue of West Berkeley, whose home
was surrounded by six feet of water
when daylight broke this morning. Thâ¬
water kept rising even then. until it
came in at the doors and made a hasty
flight to the upper story necessary.
The flood visited the first floor of Mr*.
Philip Twist's home on Fourth street
and also Joseph Irwin's, a few doors
away. Operations were entirely sus
pended at the El Dorado Oil Works
because eight inches of water filled ths
plant.
Thi gutters were so overtaxed In
many places that the streams of water
extended the full width of the streets,
making of them swift-flowtng rivers.
The most damaging of these streams
came down Shattuck avenue from
North Berkeley. It deposited most of
itc waters at University avenue and
that neighborhood much to the chagrin
and loss of storekeepers. BasemeuU
were filled up and ground floors sub
merged.
In "West Berkeley the waters tore
away the bridge that crossed the creek
at Fourth street. That section being
lower than any of the other parts of
town received the full benefit of the
overflow, the result being that half of
West Berkeley was under water. Lum
ber and boxes and things movable
floated everywhere on the tide.
Farther down the creek, between
Milvia and Grove streets, the force of
the water tore open a culvert recently
built by the Shattuck estate and over
flowed the land on either side. The
rush of vraters covered Grove street to
a depth of one foot and prevented pass
ing to and from the City Hall for sev
eral hour?.
Strawberry Creek tore through its
banks, carrying everything before It.
Great bowlders, bridges and lumber all
went speeding down the raging stream.
The wind forced a tree across the creek
at the Telegraph avenue entrance, and
part of the bridge that was torn away
was carried to the bay. Students living
on the south side of the city were com
pelled to go into the university grounds
through another entrance.
The creek overflowed its banks in two
places. At Oxford street, just where the
stream emerges from the university
grounds, the water suddenly climbed
over a lot of ( debris that had accumu
lated at that point and rushed across
the street. It required a gang of men
to clear away the debris so the water
could run freely. For a time the post
office building was threatened with in
undation.
o'clock local train from San Francisco
was held back forty-five minutes, over
flowed tracks having prevented its
coming through on time. In attempting
to get up the slope into North Berkeley
the engine slipped so much on the track
that it was necessary to back down to
Berkeley station. There a freight en
gine hooked on at the rear end and
helped the regular engine to get up the
hill. ,\ - - . â¢ 3
The water in the tidal canal between
Park street and Kruitvale avenue over
flowed the bank3, the rise being brought
about by the combined action of the
wind, the tide and the great volume of
water corning in from Sausal Creek.
A large lamp was wrenched from the
125-foot electric light mast on Webster
street and Railroad avenue and pre
cipitated through the roof of the resi
dence of J. G. Lnbben. A windmill was
blown down on Central avenue, near
Lafayette street, damaging the con
servatory of F. W. Van Sicklen. A
skylight was ripped from the roof of
the Adelphian Club Hall, in the Tucker
block, and another from the roof of the
City Hall. An immense sign on the Pa
cific Hotel was torn loose and, in fall-
Ing, demolished the paint store of J. H.
Mait. There was a mlxup of telephone
and fire-alarm wires, and a force of
men was kept constantly employed dur
ing the day In making repairs to bells
and to boxes that had been burned out.
The passengers from San Francisco
who boarded the 9 o'clock train this
morning on the narrow-gauge road
for Santa Cruz were landed at the old
ferry slip at Alameda Point. Trains on
the north side, line running to the Oak
land mole were off their schedule most
of the day, because of the irregular
time made by the boats.
At the Alameda mole the wind
crashed in a passenger shed and
toppled that over along with three
passenger coaches that were standing
on an exposed track. The train had
been made up for the morning nar
row gauge run to Santa Cruz. The
obstruction interfered with the move
ment of trains. Ferryboats could not
dock at the slip and it was not until
this afternoon at 3:20 o'clock that the
local trains resumed running on that
route.

The rainfall for San Rafael and vicin
ity is 2.4S inches, while at Sausalito It
was 4.73 inches since Wednesday at 5
p. m.
At Lime Point and Fort Baker there
was considerable damage, especially at
the former place. The quartermaster's
road running from the wharf to the
Lime Point lighthouse was washed
away for a lemg distance. The seawall
just completed by the Government was
undermined by a back wash and broken
in several places.
Hundreds of acres of land between
Ross station and Larkspur are inun

San Rafael commuters who attempt
ed to go to San Francisco before 10
o'clock this morning were stalled on
this side of the bay. The North "Shore
ferry-boats were operated after 9
o'clock and ran on time the balance
of the day. The ferry-boat Tiburon
in crossing had her rudder damaged
and put back to San Francisco. The
Donahue was sent out to take her
place, but was delayed an hour by fire
being discovered on her lower deck.
The prompt action of the officers and
crew made the damage very slight and
she was not laid up for repairs.
At Ccrte Madera three two-story
houses in course of construction and
nearly completed, owned by William
Jackman of San Francisco, were blown
down and will have to be entirely re
built.
Traffic on both the North Shore and
the California Northwestern was at a
standstill for many hours. No trains
have gone north or arrived from Caza
dero on the narrow gauge, owing to
washouts above San Anselmo, while on
the California Northwestern the up
country trains did not leave Tiburon.

There is scarcely a wharf or float

the storm.
A boathouse at Not Sausalito was
entirely washed away, together with
a number of fine rowboats that had
recently been installed. The storm

had a narrotv escape from drowning
while trying to save the latter craft.
MANY' DWELLINGS DAMAGED.
Dr. Crumpton's residence, near the
water front, was badly demolished
and his garden and outhouses were
entirely washed away. Many of the
handsome housss on the hill were
badly shaken up and piles of lumber
und wreckage slid down the steep'.in
clines, making- it dangerous to pass
near th-3 brow of the hill.
The schooner Anna Maria lost her
rigging and anchor and drifted down
on an unknown English ship. The
latter is said to have been badly shak
en up by the collision and the Anna
Maria 5s in a dilapidated condition,
besides having lost nearly all her car
go of cordweod.
The British shi;> Newgate lest her
anchor in the storm and drifted down
upon the British ship Silberhorn, at an
chor a short distance away. The Silber
horn was badly damaged by the colli
sion. Her* fore topgallant and royal
masts were carried away and her fore
topsail was also lost. Ker rigging was
almost entirely - demolished and she
now lies at anchor in an almost helpless
condition. The Newgate also suffered
much from the collision, her rigging be
ing badly tangled up. Both ships lost a
large r>ortion of their lumber cargoes.
The British ships Buteshire, Gunford,
Chelmsford, Saint Mirren and Kensing
ton are all ashore on the flats and are
all in a helpless condition. They were
engaged in unloading cargoes of coal
and wood In port, and all lost heavily
by the storm.
Smith's boathouse at old Sausalito is
a complete wreck. The big float was
washed away, by the swell and several
boats and launches were either broken
to r>iecÂ«s on the rocks or carried out
into the stream by the flood and the
fierce gale-- Tne loss to the -boathouse
is very heavy, though the exact amount
is not yet known. .

Many of the vessels were discharg

The town of Sausalito suffered se

the coast early yesterday morning and
the thriving- place at daylight pre
sented a wrecked appearance. Wharves
were washed away, ships stranded on
the mud rats and wreckage, blown
hither and thither by the furious gale,
strewed the streets in every part of the
viilage.
The da.maÂ£e done by the storm will
mount ud into thousands of dollars,
though j'jst how much no one is yet
prepared to say, for no attempt has
been made to Sgrure it out. That no
fatalities resulted is considered mirac
ulous, as the storm raged while fisher
men, sailors and others were in the
midst of preparing for their day's work
or protecting their property against
further damase.
Water street, the main thorough
fare of the place, is nearly all washed
eway. There is not room in the street
for one wagon to pass another and
consequently traffic in the town is al
most entirely tied up. What Is left
of Water street is so full of rubbish

The reports that the Japanese have

the Russian line of communication to
the Yalu, cannot be confirmed. If the
Information proves true, a land engage

be delayed, as the Russians have a
heavy force south of the line, between
Liaoyang and Mukden, and they also
are occupying strong positions along

"All ' officials of the Government â
civil, military and naval â are hereby
directed not only to observe the Presi
dent's proclamation of the neutrality
in the pending war between Russia
and Japan, but also 'to abstain from
either action or speech which can legit
imately cause Irritation to either of the
combatant?. The Government of the
United States represents the people of
the United States not only in the sin
cerity with which it is endeavoring to
keep the scales of neutrality exact and
even, but in the sincerity with which
it deplores the breaking out of the pres
ent war and hopes that it will end at
Â¦the earliest; possible moment and with
the smallest' possible loss to those en
gaged. Such a war inevitably .increases
and>inflames the susceptibilities of the
combatants to anything in the nature
of an injury or slight by outsiders.
Too often combatants make conflicting
claims as to the duties and obligations
of neutrals, so that, even when dis
charging these duties and obligations
with scrupulous care, it is difficult to
avoid giving offense to one or the other
party.
"To such unavoidable causes of of
fense due to the performance of na
tional duty there must not be added
any avoidable causes. It is always un
fortunate to bring Old World antipa
thies and jealousies into our life or by
speech or conduct excite anger and re
sentment toward our nation in friend
ly foreign lands; but in a Government
employe, whose official position makes
hlnr in some sense the representative
of tlÂ»e people, the mischief of such ac
tion is greatly increased. A strong and
self-confident nation ehould be partic

but of the susceptibilities of Its neigh
borsâand nowadays all of the nations
of the wc-rld are neighbors, one to the
other. Courtesy,, moderation and self
restraint should mark international no
less than private intercourse.
"All of the officials of the Govern

WASHINGTON, March 10.âPresi

Secretary of State Hay, issued the fol

observance of the proclamation recent

ity of the United States between Rus
sia r.nd Japan, the combatant nations
in the Far Eastern war now in- pro

Admiral kamimura does not men
tion in his report anything concern^
ing Russian operations in the vicinity
of Possiet Bay or Tumen River.
TOKIO, March 10.â The report, of
Vicfc Admiral Kamimura, in command
of the Vladivostok naval expedition,
reached the Navy Department here
early this morning'. It evidently came
by. way of Wusan, where the squadron
was expected to call upon Its return.
The "report throws little additional
light upon the movement, except that
it seems to show that the Russian
squadron remained safely within the
Vladivostok harbor, under the pro
tection of the shore batteries.
Admiral Kamimura says that he
bombarded the harbor for forty min
utes and believes the fire was very
effective. At 0 o'clock on Sunday
evening the Japanese discerned heavy
volumes of smoke ascending over the
eastern mouth of the harbor and it
was thought for a time that the Rus
sians were getting: steam up to come"
out and give battle, which waa eager
ly awaited; but the smoke gradually
died away, with no appearance of any
of the Russian ships. The Japanese
squadron searched the surrounding
bays until noon on I Monday, when H
again steamed back to the eastern en
trance of Vladivostok harbor. The
forts there did not fire at the ap
i proaching ships and- no trace waa
! found of the Rusaian squadron. Ad

other inlets in that vicinity, but found
no trace of the Russians.

Regarding the war correspondents in
Japan, Hill said they were in despair
at the reticence of the Government,
and the people found it impossible to
gain even a scran of authentic news.
So far as Captain. Hill was aware there
was not a foreign correspondent with
either the Japanese fleet or army.
Captain Hill says that when the two
Japanese cruisers got through the Suez
canal they were closely followed by the
Russian squadron, which was evidently
trying hard to keep in close touch with
them. The Aurora, which enjoys the
reputation of being one of the fastest
Russian vessels, attempted to overhaul
the .two cruisers, which, however, put
on â¢ full steam and ran away from her
with the greatest ease.
Captain Hill had a long conversation
with the Japanese admirals when in
Japan shortly before leaving, and they
told him that the main object of the
Japanese operations at present was
Port Arthur. They are to capture the
port at any cost and were confident of
their ability to do "so. No effort, the
Japanese Minister assured Hill, would
be spared to reduce Port Arthur as
quickly as possible. It would then be
refortifled by the Japanese, who would
remain there, instead of following the
Russians into the wilds of Northern
Manchuria or Siberia. The intention
also is to reduce Vladivostok as soon as
the ice goes out.
.In -reply to the question as to whether
the superior gunnery of the Japanese
was not due to the experience of the
Spanish-American, war gunners, Cap
tain Hill said most emphatically that
not one white man was employed on
any Japanese warship in any capacity
whatsoever.
VICTORIA, B. C. March 10.â Thr
Northern Pacific liner Olympia arrived

gain a near point of approach to the
railroad, but at the same time put
themselves between two bodies of their
enemy. They have a line of retreat
to Takushan. however. The Russians
on the Yalu River are also placed be
tween two hostile armies, but can re
treat up the Yalu to Chosan, and thence
by Fensulinjr to Liaoyang or Muk
den, unless cut off by a Japanese force
advancing: west from Gensan or Won
san. Quick action on the part of either
force wilL bring something decisive out
of the present situation.

ST. PETERSBURG. March 10.â The
Novof Vremya says: "We can scarcely
accept of England's professed friend
ship idea, in view of the English expe
ditions to Tibet and the declaration
that England Is sending the latest type
of improved cannon and rifles to her
Indian frontier, and of her having sub
sidized the steamers of the Canadian
Pacific line and armed and warned
them to be ready for Immediate ser
vJee."
BERLIN", March 10.â For some days
1 aft the Berlin prees has been giving
prominence to all kinds of pessimistic
rumors regarding strained relations be
tween Russia and England. It seems
to register with, a â¢ certain pleasure
various phases of the newspaper war
now going en between the two coun
tries.
The most sensational of all recent
rumors is one given currency by the
Berliner Tageblatt. According to Col- |
onel Gadke, the Berliner Tageblatt's
military correspondent, at present in
St. Petersburg, in military circles in
the Russian capital the outlook regard
ing relations with Great Britain in the
near future is etill pessimistic. The
jreneral idea is that war with England
will be the natural consequence of the
Russo-Japanese conflict, and prepara
tions are already being made for this
eventuality â so much so that, by order
of the Minister of Marine, leasing of
villas on the island of Kotlin is strictly
prohibited or mnst be broken off, since
the island is required by the Admiralty
for the erection of fortifications. A
similar prohibition also applies to vari
ous localities on the Finnish and Baltic
roasts.
News from a reliable source is also at
hand of armaments on the frontier of
Turkestan. These reports are so ex- t
traordinnry that und<Â»r ordinary cir
cumstances they would <<je passed over
as mere inventions, but Colonel Gadke
is an officer of distinction, who ranks
as one of the leading military writers
in Germany, and as he writes above his
sipnature "ne may assume that he
thoroughly recognizes the gravity of
the statements he makes.
Further communications from the
Caucppus express the conviction that
prevails there that Russia' is fully pre
pared to march against India, but that
it is not decided whether the advance
>vill be made through Persia or through
tlr* Pamirs.
Berlin new^r-ap^rs also give prom
inence to statements cf the Novoe
Vr'-mya that trouble is growing in
Persia and that Teheran Is full of Eng
lish secret ajrents, who are seeking to
excite the population against Ru??ia by
f-xafrgeratircr reports of Japanese vic
tories. The semi-official press continues
to lav stress on thÂ» close friendship
now exifctirs; between Germany and
Russia.
"Germany." says th? Post this even
ing, "was for many years slandered

sia realir^F that her true friend is Ger
many. If Gerrrany and Russia Ftnnd
toeether, tbey have nothing to fear

tion."
The Daily Mall believes the alleged
presence of Japanese at Fungwans
cheng is finally disproved by the news
that there has been an Important en
counter between Japanese and Russian
soldiers near Pingyang, 150 miles to
the south of Fungwangcheng.

"It Is more than probable that thtj
successive alarms at Posslet Bay and
Liangehen were only designed to create
scares that would keep the Russians in
uncertainty at every point of the Ion?
line in order the more easily to effect
a landing where the Japanese had made
no demonstration. Therefore. I am in
clined to think it is probabl*Â», though
still uncertain, that the news of yes
terday will so far be substantially con
firmed that we shall find the Japanese
have landed virtually unopposed some
where on the northern shore of Korea

Takushan. and that from there they
have advanced -to Fungr'va.nsehen*',
pushing on an advanced detachment to

News of a series of minor Japanese
victories on the frontier would not
surprise the German experts, for thÂ«
reasons stated. . In fact, they have ex
pected to hear of Russian "retreats."
and believe the Slav is pursuing his
ancient strategy, falling back until the
pursuit reaches ground where he can
deal a crushing blow. Whether the
shrewdness of the Japanese leaders
will prevent their being lured Into a
trap remains to -be seen, but It Is
feared that the flush of seeming vic
tory will prove the undoing of the
Orientals in their first brush with the
trained leaders of a European army.
LOXDOX, March 11.â Most of. the
newspaper commentators on the Far
Eastern military and naval situation
this morning content themselves with
pulverizing the reports of a Japanese
invasion of Manchuria and of a re
newed bombardment of Port Arthur.
The tnilitary correspondent of the Daily
Telegraph, however, writes:
German military men are of the be
lief that the Japanese are being lured
on to disaster by tactics which have
characterized the Muscovite in all of
his wars. "Beware of the Russian re
treat" is a maxim in European armies.
Russan leaders long ago learned the
effectiveness of pretending defeat ana
falling back, luring the pursuing army
far from its base of supplies and strik
ing a crushing, blow when the enemy
had been placed at a disadvantage.
It is felt that the Japanese, because
of their lack of cavalry, must be par
ticularly cautious in their advance in
Manchuria and that they should make
no forward movement except in
strength sufficient to hold any position
they may capture and at the same time
protect their line of communications.
It has been expected from the outset
in local military circles that the Rus
sians would feign defeat and fall back
in Manchuria until the Japanese forces
had been attracted far inland. Then,
while the infantry attacks in front, a
swarm of Cossacks would be hurled
down the flanks of the Japanese.
Should the "little brown men'* ever
meet a reverse and be compelled to
fall back, they v would find a Cossack
horde on all sides, like hounds worry-
Ing a fleeing stag. * ; f
BERLIN*. March ll.-Gennan mili
tary experts are disposed to accept
with reserve the reports that a Jap
anese force has landed In the rear of
the Russian position on the Yalu and
captured Fungyangcheng. The dar
ing of this dash, which, if made at a 11.
rnusf have been by a comparatn , ely
small force, would excite admiration,
but at the same time there is a dis
position to criticize the movement on
strategical grounds. If the Japanese
have occupied the Manchurian terri
tory reported in the dispatches, their
position would be extremely critical
should the Russian forces on the Yalu
and along the Manchurian railroad
iÂ»ake a combined attack. Unless th-s
Japanese force is exceedingly strong,
which can scarcely be the case, con
sidering the quickness with which its
landing was effected, it Is so far out
numbered by the Russians that the
latter should sweep it back into tha
sea.

"I prescribe Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets
for all cases of stomach trouble. I
have tried many prescriptions, includ-
ing a number of my own, but find
nothing that gives such universal re-
lief as this remedy. They are natural,
harmless and thoroughly effective in
their work. and. while I have a natural
ciitipathy to patent medicines, I do
not hesitate to prescribe and recom-
mend Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets on all
occasions."
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are for
sale by all druggists at 50 cents a box.
They are so well known and their
popularity is so great that a druggist
would as soon think of being" out of
alcohol or quinine. The above testi-
monial of the physician is no excep-
tion... In fact physicians are prescrib-
ing them all over the land and if your
own doctor is real honest with you he
will tell you frankly that there Is noth,
ing on earth so good for' dyspepsia as
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets. ".

Los Angeles Is Drenched. . :
LOS ANGELES, March 10. âThe
heaviest rainstorm of the season pre
vailed over Southern California this
afternoon and evening. Rain * began
falling at ! o'clock and continued
-steadily until 10 o'clock to-night' The
streets in the lower parts of the city
were running full of water this even
ing, but no damage aside from a few
washed-out sewers occurred. Thp
storm is opportune and will do (ood
to crowing crops'
McGeoghegan, accompanied by Mr.
Robertson of. the surety company,
went before City Justice Davison late
this afternoon and , McGeoghegan : se
cured a search ' warrant against Wil
liam Taaffe, alleging -that he possessed
a key to the" Inner vault of the Treas
urer's office. McGeoghegan alleged
that on or about January 10 Taaffe had
a key made for the .vault, and that he
might use it without warrant. . Chief
of Police Carroll served the warrant
this' evening and Taaffe surrendered
the key without complaint He said
that McGeoghegan had ( told ; him to
have it, made.' Taaffe acted as a dep
uty under McGeoghegan. .
McGeoghegan has engaged Attorney
Rosenthal for' his defense. The friends
of -thÂ« Treasurer are raising -some
money and to-night they, feel confident
Tt was stated that this resolution
does not empower the Mayor to prose
cute MoGeohegan for appropriating the
city funds. J
Assistant District Attorney Coolidge
and HI S. Bridges of the City Attor
ney's office were interested spectators
at the Council meeting. Their pres
ence at the meeting gives rise to the
belief that the District Attorney's of
llce will place the matter' before the
Grand Jury. i
Attorney D. M. Burnett was present
in the interest of William Taaffe, who
acted as deputy to McGeoghegan.
There has been some insinuations that
Taaffe knew of the shortage. Taaffe
denies taking any of the coin or know-"
ing of a shortage.
sider the different phases of Mc-
Geoghegran's case. The Mayor read
the report of Expert Keane, the with
drawal of the surety companies
from McGeoghegan's bonds and the
Treasurer's resignation.
Henry D. Matthews, Councilman-at
large, was appointed City Treasurer by-
Mayor "Worswlck, and the Council
unanimously confirmed the appoint^
ment. The new Treasurer has been
chairman of the' Finance Committee of
the City Council for some time, and his
knowledge of affairs will be a great
help in straightening out the entan
glement. Matthews is a prominent
business man of this citi^.
Councilman . Hubbard introduced a
resolution, which was adopted, that
the Mayor be instructed , to take all
legal steps to recover .from Thomas J.
McGeoghegan and his sureties the
amount of the shortage in the office
of Treasurer and to do all other acts
and things necessary to protect the in
terests of the city.
GRAND JURY 3IAY ACT.
A special meeting of thÂ« City Coun
cil was held this afternoon to con-
McGeoghegan sent his resignation
v as Treasurer to Mayor Worswick to
day. It was a very 'short document
and McGeoghegan asked to be re
lieved of his duties at once.
Keane's report shows an increase of
$900 more than given by Messrs. Lloyd
and Robertson.
Charles J. Keane, who experted the
books for Mayor Worswick, states in
his report:
"I have made an examination of the
affairs of said office and I find from a
comparison of the account-books* in
the office of the City Clerk in and for
the city of San Jose with those of the
City Treasurer that there is a deficit
in the funds of said city amounting to
not less than $7916 32. . A 'full and
complete report will be furnished
your Honor as soon as practicable."
From the cursory examination made
Keane is not . prepared to say just
when the money was taken. He
says the defalcation may be greater
than what he has found. Keane ex
perted the books back to July 1, 1902,
when the "Worswick administration
came into power. The books will be
experted back to the appointment of
McGeoghegan as City Treasurer at
the time of the death of the late J. X.
Ewing, more than five years ago.

IN all times and in all climes, from centuries before the
Christian era to the present, and from ancient Greece
to fair California, the tensest string in the gamut of
human emotions has been the one attuned to vibrate to
the deeds of a hero. In the hurry and scurry of : life it
may sometimes seem as though selfishness' were the
dominant passion and that self-sacrifice were dead in the
world; that the feeling the Greeks had in venerating
their heroes, even to the point of regarding them as
demi-gods, is old-fashioned and vanished from the world.
But the age\of heroes has not passed away, and at
times we are reminded of that fact by the brave deed of
some hero still among us.

CHINESE LANGUAGEâ A. B. f!..
City. The printed or written Chinese
language is intelligible to educated
Chinese all over the empire.
Just as the numerals 1. 2, 3, 4. 5, et<\.
are understood all over the Continent
of Europe and of the world generally,
but the sooken language has manv
dialects, often differing widely from
each other, so that me*n living In dif
ferent prefectures of the same prov
ince are oftentimes unable to under
stand each other, unless they have
made their dialects a particular study.
Beside* the number of dialects many
of the characters have several differ
ent meanings, according to the breath
ing or tone with which they are pro
nounced or the connection in which
they are written or spoken. In order
to make the knowledge of the Chinese
valuable to a commercial agent in
China he should leari) all the dialects.
The written language is made up of
80.000 characters and each must be
learned by sound. s In the Cyclopedia
Brittanica. to be seen in the referencÂ«
room of the free public library, there
is a lens and interesting article on this
language under the head of China.

With a gravity fitting the event it was announced in
reference to n recent lynching of a negro by a Spring
field mob that the lynchers were in particularly good
humor, orderly and gay to the limit of jest and joke
during their hideous work. Is it possible to conceive of
a sterner arraignment of a community than this brutally
frank recital of an appalling crime that should be for
eign even to imagination in a people bound by the crudest
laws of civilization?
Were it possible to forecast the
rapid development of cities or to pre

would scarcely have been able to pre

All cities, with few exceptions, trace
the origin of their plan to the inclosed
camp, and many still show marked
features of primitive fortifications. In
all early schemes for defense the In
closed square was cons'dered the best.
From the time when wagons "were
merely parked on the plain to the
time when buildings were constructed
with blank walls to the enemy, and
thsir facade to the open square, this
plan has. been universally adopted;
and many of the , great squares -or
market places of famous cities still
show undeniable evidences of these
precautions for defense. In the old
city of Brussels, the square upon
which faces its wonderful City Hall,
is approached by streets so narrow
that they must surely have been con
structed with the idea of defense in
mind. .

from San Francisco to San Jose will be carried nearer
to us, to become what naturally they were intended to
be â suburbs of the metropolis. When these pretty and
thriving towns are given transportation facilities now
enjoyed by Alameda County San Fraricisco will receive
its normal expansion and the peninsula will quicken to
the spur of enterprise and prosperity.

"Willie Mdrari Is a typical street gam-
In. He is only about 12 years of age,
but as bright and shrewd as a boy
many years his 1 senior. He is naturally
a good boy, but he will not go to school.
It was . his hatred for everything
that looks like a book that caused
him to be haled before Judge Murasky
a few weeks ago during a session of the
juvenile court. The Judge had a long
talk with him and his mother, and then
called a truant officer to him, gave him
some whispered Instructions and dis
missed Willie.
Out in the corridor Willie met a num
ber of his chums. "Say. Willie." they
asked him, "what did der Judge do ter
yer? Did he send you to der home?"
"Naw," answered the gamin, with a
look of disgust. "Worse dan dat. He
told der big cop wot arrested me to call

Compulsory Education.
It has taken a long campaign of education to convince
any considerable number of Americans that they are
the victims of an oppressor who is robbing them of
their just dues, but incessant repetition of the falsehood,
accompanied by every form of slander and libel that
cunning can devise and malice make use of. has had its
effect in the larger cities of the Union and in some of the
strongholds of Northern Democracy. As a consequence
the yellow peril shows itself in politics this year with
a force which appears to have been sufficient to frighten
conservative Democracy out of its wits.
Â¦ Up to this time the plans of the conservatives seem
to have been utterly futile. They have held many din
ners, at which distinguished leaders have first feasted and
then made speeches, but as yet there has been no agree
ment among them as to a platform or a candidate.
Gorman, Hill, Olney, Parker, Gray and the rest appear
tc have 'lost at once their courage aird their cunning in
the face of the peril, and as far as the public can see
they are making no effort whatever to save themselves
and their party from the fate that impends. It looks,
therefore, as if the chief feature of this Presidential
campaign will be the appearance in national politics of
a yellow candidate -on a- yellow, platform preaching a
hatred of wealth and promising foiK years -of anarchy.
That is the true,"yellow peril" of the time so far as this
country is concerned. '
TO the mind of the conservative Democrat the term
"Yellow peril" refers not to the possible invasion
of Europe by Asiatic races, but to the probable tri
umph of the representatives of yellow journalism , and
yellow politics- at the coming Democratic Presidential
convention. The home yellow is far more portentous
to men of this day and generation than is the foreign
yellow, and to the Democratic camp the portent is very
threatening indeed. |
Yellow politics is of course an inevitable outcome of
yellow journalism. As soon as men perceived that ap
peals to envy and ignorance, vice and silliness couid be
made profitable in the conduct of a low class of news
paper it was but natural the lesson should be learned
by demagogues and similar appeals be made to the same
classes for their votes. The aim of yellow politics is to
inflame the unsuccessful against the successful, and in
that way to divide the American people into classes, in
which the fortunate shall be on one side and the unfor
tunate on the other. â¢ For the further purpose of
strengthening their hold on the masses the leaders of
the movement incessantly preach the doctrine that every
American workingman is an "unfortunate" who has been
robbed by the predatory rich, while every capitalist and
every employer is denounced as one of the robber class.

.Two or three years ago James J. Hill,
passing' through the offices of one of
bis corporations, noticed the general
counsel tilted back in hits chair placidly
reading a novel. This rather -nettled
him, for Mr. ii HI is business from the
soles of his feet to the hair of his head.
"How can you find time to read
no\-els in business hours?" he demand
ed of the lawyer.
. "You oupht to be glad." calmly re
sponded the attorney, "that you have
a lawyer smart enough to keep you out
of litigation so that he has time to read
novels." .
The corporation lawyer does not
necessarily make en imposing figure in
the courts.. His duty, in fact; is more
to keep his client out of litigation than
to defend him jn it. ,. :
Why did Elihu Root resign from
the Cabinet, although he was, accord
ing to President Roosevelt, the great
est man in the service of any Gov
ernment in the world? Because he
rould no longer remain as Secretary
of War when he could earn as a law
yer serving the great financial inter
ests ever eager to secure the ablest
talent :n the country at least six
times what the Government paid him
as Secretary of War. His five years'
service for the United States must
have cost Mr. Root in loss of Income
what would by most people be consid
ered a large fortune.
John W. Griggs, who made one "of
the arguments before the Supreme
Court in behalf of the Northern Se
curities Company, was Attorney Gen
eral in JIcKinley's Cabinet, but found
the emoluments of a corporation law
yer more attractive than the distinc
tion of public office. Curiously enough
the opposite is true of the present At
torney General, Mr. Knox, who, al
though a corporation attorney, gave
up his practice to enter the Cabinet,
and made a very able argument
against the Northern Securities Com
pany in reply to Mr. Griggs.
. A great lawyer who has not yet suc
cumbed to the temptation of a rail
road corporation's fee is United States
Circuit Court Judge Grosscup, who
has steadfastly resisted every effort to
move him from his present position,
which he regards as a splendid plat
form from which to address the coun
try on the necessity of corporation re
form by Government regulation and
publicity.
As a rule the corporations arÂ«f bet
ter served than the Government itself,
because thÂ«* former are able to pay
more for high-class brains. This is
particularly true of. the railroads.
Such men as Francis L. Stetson, coun
sel for several of the Morgan roads;
George R. Peck. ex-Judge Dillon, ex-
Senatdr Woleott and Dodd and Elliott
of .the Standard Oil Company are the
kind that naturally find their place in
the service of great capitalistic inter
ests.
The rewards of professional service to
corporations are so large as to reduce
to a minimum the attractions of inde
jiendeiit practice or of political distinc
tion. Mr. Cromwell has with notable
success served as legal adviser of cor
porations and financial interests, and in
this commercial age, when everything
is measured by moneyâ the $ mark be
ing the only insignia of American a ris- %
tocrac-yâto earn a $2,000,000 fee in one
great negotiation is regarded as a
more tempting reward than even the
applause of a Senate.
Rev. Donald Sage Mackey. quotes An
drew Carnegie as saying that "the
fundamental weakness of all trusts is
tl-at they cannot monopolize brains."
"What he meant by this was that while
trusts might be able to monopolize raw
material, methods of manufacturing
and agencies for sale, they could not
monopolize the brains that may dis
cover new sources of raw product, in
vent new systems of manufacture and
new ways of advertisement and sale.
In a sense this is true. But the cor
porations go very far toward establish
lishing a monopoly of the best brains.
That is to say, they are able to com
mand their services by the large pala
lies and fees which they alone have the
means to pay.
It was recently announced that Ed
ward M. Shepard had resigned as coun
sel of the rajid transit commission of
New York Cityâ a $10,000 salaried posi
:ion â to become counsel to the Penn
sylvania Railroad at a salary not made
public, but reported to be in the neigh
borhood of 550,000. That means that the
Pennsylvania Railroad is able to buy
cae of the best brains in the country,
and that the offer it made to Mr. Shep
ard was so tempting that he not only
resigned his place in the government of
the city, but in large measure sacri
ficed his political ambitions. Mr. Shep
ard is not only an able lawyer, but one
of the keenest . political pamphleteers
in the United States, and- his friends re
gard him as measuring up to Presi
dential standards, but as counsel for a

availability is much diminished 4

And these same qualities in even
one (if carried up to their very high
est power) stand many good chances
of reproducing themselves in the other
during the long and educative years
of married life, and so securing what
seemed to be a fugitive bliss.
Do not let calculation stifle instinct.
It is the fatal weakness of "calcula
tion" â that â¢.while it Is able 2 to thwart
the marrying impulse in youth, it is
impotent to reanimate that impulse
in maturity.
If you. do. not. marry. when you want
to you will not. marry, when you wish
to.
Undoubtedly marriage is in a cer
tain sense a lottery, but it is a hazard
in which the Â«take is so creat that a
man who will not resolutely throw
the dice is a coward or a fool. The
"absolute whole" of earthly bliss is to
be found in a happy marriage. No
one was ever so happy single but
that millions _ have been a thousand
times happier double. To remain un
married for fear of risking unneces
sary sorrow is like refusing to live in
order to avoid unnecessary dangers.
Especially when one realizes that
nine-tenths of all marital unhappiness
Is absolutely -unnecessary and inex
cusable, being the fruit of individual
unreason and not the inevitable con
comitant of the relationship itself.
By marrying we put ourselves in
the way of enjoying life's most per
fect friendship â the love of the oppo
site sex; of securing life's most pow
erful incentive to industry, sobriety,
unselfishness â the responsibility of j a
family; of enjoying life's most hon
eyed sweetness â the love of little
children; of gaining life's most pro
found consolation â the care of our
old age by the devotion of offspring.
The young people of this age are to
be pitied because they breathe an at
mosphere tainted with marital un
happiness. Everywhere they see sel
fish and irrational people chafing unr
der the bonds of marriage, simply be
cause they refuse to put a curb upon
their passions. On every side the
squeaking of the hinges on the di
vorce court doors fills the land with
discord. That utterly unsettling ques
tion (the very asking of which is a
symptom of weakness and deteriora
tion), "is marriage a failure?"' fills
them with skepticism and alarm.
But if they are to be .pitied they are
also to be blamed. For they are old
enough at a marriageable age to be
able to discriminate the essential from
the fictitious obstacles to happiness. in
this heaven ordained , relationship.
They ought to be able to see that the
obstacles to t happiness in marriage
are no more essential and no more
numerous than the obstacles to suc
cess in business or science or art.
Some people are proud of not hav
ing married until they saw their way
clearly to a "good living." But some
c-f us are equally proud of the fact
that we fell in love like the birds and.
like them, mated with as little fear of
being able to find our daily crumbs.
Did not the good God make us to love
and to live? Why should we be afraid
to do either? If I did not believe in
the right to live and love I should pray
for death, for to doubt those two pil
lars of the temple of existence is to
doubt the divinity who dwells within
the shrine.
Â¦ Some people consider this a happy
state of affairs, but I do not. They
think it conduces to the general wel
fare to have fewer marriages and to
have them contracted in deliberate pru
dence, a method which I believe to
be fatal to "the best interests of so
ciety. People may, of course, marry
when they are too young; but the trou
ble is that if they do not marry when
they are young enough they will not
marry at all. And, however reason
able it seems that "calculation" at 30
or 33 should make more happy mar
riages than impulse and instinct at "2
or 20, it has never been shown to-be- a
fact.
These considerations, and many oth
ers like them, have made marriage a
matter of educated calculation rather
than inherited instinct, and nothing is
so fatal to matrimony as calculation.
This is a phenomenon that challenges
our investigation, for it is certain to
uc-rk some sort of revolution in the
social system.
The reasons for the fact are not hard
to find. Young women-are able to de
cline * unsatisfactory offers, because
their prospects of self-support have
been enormously increased. Young
men are less ready to undertake the
.maintenance of a family, because the
standards c-f a "good living" are be
ing steadily elevated and the expenses
of keeping up an establishment have
risen with them. Both sexes have come
to desire and demand more out of life
than the earnings of a single sex can
procure. It is easier to be a bachelor
or a spinster than a husband or a wife,
and the mere luxuries of the single
estate are more than twice those of
the double one.
In all the upper circles of society
(measured by wealth and culture) mar
riages seem to be decreasing in num
ber and to be postponed to a later and
later period of life.

tion and by indicating legal ways of
doing things that were in the highest
degree desirable, but whlcn seemed, im
possible. â¢
That, in fact, is the main mission of
the corporation lawyer. He may rarely
importune a jury and only occasionally"
address a bench of judges. The char
acter of the legal profession has greatly
changed since the days of Daniel Web
ster and Rufus Ohoate. Little impas
sioned oratory 5s heard nowadays in
the courts. Indeed, there is small need
of oratory of any kind. The real argu
ment is presented in the typewritten
briefs handed up to the Judges. The
typewriter has in large measure taken
the place of the human voice. Read
the argument of Attorney General
Knox in the Northern Securities case.
There is scarcely any. figure of speech
or other adornment of language, not
an unnecessary adjective â just cold
logic. When he had finished his argu
ment he stopped just where he was,
without any rhetorical flourish.
and I can't swim." Quick came the answer from young
Smith, "I can,", and forthwith he leaped into the Wil
lamette River, where Oza Brown, a 12-year-old girl,
was struggling for her life. Smith held the girl aloft
until she was saved, but before the rescuers could reach
him he was caught by the treacherous cramp and gave
his life in sacrifice to duty.
The call to him was tragic and sudden, but gallantly
he met it, counting not the cost, and was baptized a
hero in the murky waters of the Willamette. None
among us can be more noble or make a greater sacrifice
than that made by one who in the first flush of athletic
manhood freely dies that a helpless girl may live. The
name that the steamer bore, American, to uphold which
so many heroes have nobly died, will be honored by none
more worthy than this young Oregonian, and though
from the pitiless tide, swollen by spring freshets, Sum
ner Smith's body may never be recovered, all will pause
in honest admiration at the thought that he gave up his
life that another might live.
The whole criticism is complimentary to Mr. Hay and
to the American diplomatic school of which he is the
leading exponent. He need be no mystery to the
chancellories of Europe, provided they are not so'mor
ally blunted that they cannot distinguish between right
and wrong. All they have to do to avoid nervous shock
or international hysterics is to remember that in all the
affairs of the world in which the United' States has a
legitimate interest Mr. Hay may be counted on to do the
right thing at the right time. With such a plain under
standing Americans hope the several Chancellors will be
able to rest nights and not jump nervously every time
a cablegram is announced.
move. . . . .
What was every chancellory in Europe doing to lo
calize the War that was held up by Mr. Hay's note? The.
.statement is a falsehood on its face.' The only thing
that could have spread the war would have been dis
respect for the administrative entity of , China. If the
chancellories were doing what this Russian says they
were they should all be thankful for the help Mr. Hay
gave them, for his note was exactly what they lacked to
make sure the policy they arc said to have been seek
ing. How, then, did his note come near defeating
them? It could defeat only an agreement to violate Chi
nese neutrality and territory, and if that is what the
chancellories were talking about it caught them in con
spiracy and defeated it. %
RUSSIA announces inability to understand Secre
tary Hay's diplomacy,, and declares that but for
him Europe would be in fine accord and in sub
stantial agreement on the Eastern question. Americans
are not surprised that Russia fails to comprehend
American diplomacy. It is because the crooked cannot
understand the straight. Mr. Hay's policy consists in
doing the right thing at the right time. It is so ob
viously right that no, other nation dare take the risk of
disagreeing with him.
. His foresight was better than that of others' when he
addressed his open door note to Europe and got the
powers to agree that all have an equal right, to Chinese
trade. Impliedly that is one of his acts complained of by
Russia. Yet she assented to it. ' It- will be seen that, by
whoever proposed, that policy was so right that no com
mercial nation dared to dissent, though they each might
have been sorry for the chance to agree. Each may have
cherished secret hopes of exclusive advantages, as it is
sure Russia and. Germany did, but when directly asked
by Mr. Hay if that was what they were thinking about
each declared that it was thinking about something else,
and with unwilling alacrity subscribed to the open door.
It was a hard thing to do, but it had to be done. Re
fusal would have been confession of the intention to close
China against everybody else, and this Russia even did
not dare to disclose. There is no doubt that after that
experience with Mr. Hay any nation that intended doing
wrong in the East kept uneasily looking back to see if
Mr. Hay was in sight anywhere on the track.
Germany and Russia would like to join hands in bring
ing China to the block, and France is probably not
averse to getting across the Yangtsekian'g to enlarge her
Indo-Chinese possessions. Their plans would .dovetail
finely, and against such a combination England would
be quite ineffective. She could not even consult the
triumvirate of interested nations, because she has an
Asiatic empire exposed to attack. No other nation ex
cept the United States could ask Europe if it thought of
cutting China in convenient pieces. When Mr. Hay
suggested the inquiry they all hastened to hide their
carving sets and to agree with' him that Chinese neu
trality and territorial integrity must be respected.
His phrasing oT the condition made, Russia uneasy,
for it required that the "administrative entity" of China
be respected. That means that the Chinese Government
is not to be again subjected to the coercion and duress
by which Russia tried to force the treaty of which Min
ister Conger gave notice to our Government. At least
Russia so interprets the diplomatic phrase, though that
is not her only interpretation. If the authority and ad
ministrative entity of China are not safeguarded Rus
sia would have in Peking a fertile field for intrigue. She
could practically usurp the administrative functions of
China by compelling the granting of privileges of the
highest value in her contest with Japan. Of course it
would be pretended that this was the free "act of China.
Russia would like to do at Peking just what Japan has
done at Seoul, but that is impossible since Mr. Hay's
note.
In sending that note he simply followed his open
door policy. The self-respect of our Government would
have been shamed if he had kept silent. Now it is vin
dicated, and only those who have been restrained from
wrongdoing are .affronted.
The Russian criticism of Mr. Hay is no doubt official,
for it has the Janus face of Muscovite officialdom. Say
infj that "every chancellory in Europe was working to
avert a general catastrophe by preventing the entangle
ment of an outside power in this war when Mr.
Hay's note almost defea.tcd them," this Russian critic
declares that they are all on the qui-vive for his next

The history of the campaign he made
against the wishes of his fellow Mor
nÂ»ons, of his defeat and his subsequent
trial before a committee of church offl
cials was given in detail, and then
Thatcher's submission to the will of
the church was read and put in the
record of the Smoot investigation. This
recantation showed Thatcher totally
broken in spirit and bowing absolutely
to the mandates of the church in that
the consent of an officers' quorum must
be obtained in' order that he may con
tinue in good standing. The purpose
of the testimony was to show that it
was necessary, according to the rules
of the church, for Reed Smoot to have
obtained the consent of the church be
fore he could have become a candidate
for the Senate. In addition to the
Thatcher episode Critchlow gave the
history of the prosecutions in Utah on
charges of polygamous cohabitation
since the passage of the Edmunds law
and the legislation in the Territory and
State which affects Mormonism or po
lygamy. His story was concise and
entertaining and he was Interrupted
but little.
Andrew Jensen, the assistant histo
rian of the church, gave testimony
showing the supremacy - of the presi
dent of the church. He related the
methods of the church, its control by
presidents of stakes and bishops. The
president of the church, said this wit
ness, appointed the presidents of the
stakes, some fifty-three In number, and
these latter appointed the bishops, sev
eral hundred in number. The bishops
could-not act until their appointments
were approved by the president of the
church.- â¢ ' Â¦ - â¢ ' '
WASHINGTON, March 10.â OnÂ© of
the most interesting and important fea

tor Reed Smoot case before the Com
mittee on Privileges and Elections to
day was the testimony of E. B. Critch
low, formerly an Assistant United
States Attorney In Utah, who ,told tha
story of the Moses Thatcher episode.
According to his version, which was
borne out by official records. Apostle
Thatcher persisted in continuing as a
candidate for the United States Senate
against the wishes of a quorum of the
apostles, and on that account was held
to be "not In harmony with his quo
rum." ' Â¦ . Â¦

Inclement weather forced Jimmy
Britt to confine his training work to
his gymnasium at Croll's Gardens, In
Alamoda. yesterday. He boxed with
Frank Rafael, â¢ skipped the rope,
punched the bag and went through a
number of other stunts. In the even
ing Jimmy attended a meeting in Oak
land of the Butchers' Union. When
the weather settles Britt will resume
his road work. He is gradually reduc
ing in weight and feels he will make
the require limit without detracting
from his full strength.
Next week all aspiring: boxers, either
a^mateur or professional, will be wel
comed at the camp. Corbett likes to
take on a variety of boxers, as he has
to make a quick study of their style,
which makes him alert and also trues

of distance. He is wearing light gloves
on both hands at present, but they

Corbett'e most satisfactory work was
in the ring with Billy Otts. They went
four, fast rounds, three of them being
of the customary three minutes dura
tion and the last extending over nearly
Twenty-five minutes withput a let-up.
There was a lot of wrestling and tug
ging, the champion letting his op
ponent hustle him about the ring. Cor
liett was in high spirits and kept up a
continual fire of witty remarks at his
partner, besides sneaking in some hard
blows.
All the wires leading out of his train
ing quarters being down yesterday.
Young Corb<?tt found it impossible to
communicate with his betting commis
sioner, so he-settled down to hard work
in his gymnasium. The little champion
was very much in earnest and showed
that he realizes the sej^ousness of the
contract he has on his hands. He is
fairly larded in fat at present, but with
all this he went through more than an
hour's fast work in the gymnasium
without breathing hard. If this is a
fair 6amj>le of the work he will do for
ihe next two weeks he will enter the
i ing fit to fight for his life. He used
the pulley weights, punched the bag
and fought the big swinging .dummy.

LOS ANGELES, March 10.â "J. T.
Strite ruled off and the firm of
Johnson & Dodson suspended in
definitely" was the ruling of the
judges at Ascot to-day, which fur
nished considerable comment but not
much surprise as far as Strite is con
cerned. 'The offense of which the three
turfmen, according to the judges, are
guilty is "collusion in a selling race and
a division of the run-up money," and
the specific case for which they suffered
this extreme penalty was the bidding
up of the winner of the flfth race yes
terday. Grail won the race, and Discus,
owned by Johnson & Dodson. was sec
ond. Strite ran Grail up from $500, her
entered price, to $1000, and" she was re
tained by her owner by the usual $5 in
crease over the last bid. Johnson &
Dodson therefore came in for half of
the run-up money, viz., $250.
Strite has bid up many horses during
the present meeting at Ascot, in sev
eral instances where he had no horse In
the race. The Judges therefore were
suspicious, and when the $250 was paid
to Johnson to-day a detective was set
upon his heel6.
Johnson met Strite and paid him $120
in gold as his 'share - of the run-up
money that went to the owner of Dis
cus.
A steady rain fell throughout the aft
ernoon and the changed track condi
tions proved bad for favorites. One out
of six came in first and liberal priced
horses won the other five. Weather
rainy, track sloppy.

ENTRIES FOR TO-DAY.
From present indications a field of at
least ten two-year-olds will start in
the Bell stake to-morrow^ Prince
Brutus not having 'wholly recovered
from his recent Illness, will be an ab
sentee. The following are among the
almost certain starters: Amy J, Arisbe,
Salable, Pinkerton, Henry Ach, Ben
Eric, Eduardp and George P. McNear.
There was plenty of snap and ginger
about the saddle work of "Big Bill"
Knapp yesterday. He landed In suc
cession Idogo and Theodora It, both
long shots in the betting. \
Bell broke it up again badly on Po
lonius, â¢ and the betting # on the horse
certainly did not look healthy. The
Burns & Waterhouse Jockey has been
playing in such poor .luck -' that ' the
judges ruled that in future his mounts
be confined' to his employers' horses
only.
Bookmaker Joe Blumn . and crew
leave for New Tork this morning. Joe,
who. is a part owner of Oarsman and
Namtor, likes the game here and will
be back next season.
Johnny Daly, who was given a five
day vacation for rough riding on Wed
nesday, was not allowed to - ride Po
lonius yesterday.
Bonner rode Quiz' II, favorite for the
fourth, a three-quarter selling run, as if
seated on twenty pounds the best horse,
and "Big Bill" Knapp astride Idogo
beat him out. Bonner experienced no
difficulty in taking the lead with the
first choice, rating him along carefully
instead of opening up a gap of two or
three lengths. Knapp rode a splendidly
judged race on Idogo, and nailing Quiz
near the paddock downed him nearly a
length. Maraschino, a 20 to 1 shot, took
the show. C. Smith was not strong
enough to do Justice to Pruewood or the
mare would have been a contender.
Jean Gravier also requires an aggres
sive pilot.
Theodora L, winner of the mile and
fifty yard run, should some day win the
Thornton stake. She apparently has an
inexhaustible supply of staying quali
ties and is not averse to testing them.
After disposing of Illowaho by nearly
a length at odds of 16 to 1, Knapp could
not pull the mare up. She ran away
two and a quarter miles. before "Big
Bill" could control her. El Fonse broke
down in the race. Outburst and Polo
nius received rides that were grotesque
ly ridiculous.
NOTES OP THE TRACK.
Diminutive Dungannon seems unfor
tunate in being unable to land a race.
The little filly, with Jack Martin on
her back, was extensively played at
the scant price of 6-to 5 to take the
opening seven-furlong run and ran sec
ond to Hoceo. The latter, piloted by
Bell, received consistent support at
fours and led from start to finish.
Willie Daly on Foxy Grandpa took
show honors.
Mansard, which â¢ showed dazzling
flights of sDeed at Chicago last sum
mer, started for the first time this sea
son in the Futurity sprint next de
cided. The books appeared to be aware
of the fact that "Spike" Hennessy had
the big gelding ready and even money
was about the best obtainable. He
had Travers for a pilot and won under
gentle restraint from Olympian, after
leading throughout. Soothsayer, only
fairly well handled by Bonner, lost the
place by a neek.
It was no doubt overconfldence on
the part of C. Smith that lost the m|le
selling affair for Mr. Dingle. David S
opened favorite at 3 to 2, but as some
doubt existed as to how the old horse
would take to the stiff going, his price
receded In the betting, still he closed
favorite. J. T. Sheehati rode him and
at once made play for the lead, fol
lowed by Mr. Dingle. With something
over half the distance traversed, Smith
succeeded in getting Mr. Dingle's head
In front and the pair had it hammer
and tongs to the wire. At the pad
dock Mr. Dingle was a neck to the
good, but twenty yards from the line
Sheehan struck the favorite once .with
his whip and received a nose decision.
Prince Blazes finished a fair third.
BONNER'S POOR RIDE.
DUXGAXXOX IS PLiAYED.
The furious gale and storm of the
night before made boating possible on
some portions of the course at Oak
land yesterday and stirred up the
stones in the track proper. The fences
and grandstand were intact and every
thing else was about as the crowd left
it the preceding day.
The possibility of being wrecked on
Goat Island kept some of the land
lubbers away, for the attendance was
somewhat lighter than usual. Favorites
held their own in the heavy going,
capturing three events.
Unquestionably the last number on
the card held precedence over the
others, for four useful pieces of racing
material started therein Garnet-Fergu
son sent Lord Wadsworth to the post
and was sweet on his chances.
The colt had first call in the betting.
Stillcho looked to have an excellent
chance, and Atwood and Reeves had a
big following.
No mistake was made in Installing
Lord Wadsworth as the choice. Charley
Connell handled him to perfection,
passed Atwood on the far turn and
won as he wished from Stilicho. Reeves
was disgracefully ridden by Bonner,
finishing last.

WILLOWS, March 10. â One of the
most violent storms ever experienced
here' swept over this section last night
and this morning. The south wind
blew a hurricane and rain fell In tor
rents. Roofs were torn from a num
ber of houses, trees were uprooted and
debris is scattered over the streets. The
low lying sections of the town are in
undated. Snow is falling on the moun
tains in the western part of the county.
Telephone and telegraph lines are down
and no communication can be had with
river towns. It is feared that a large
section of the river country will be in
undated. At Greenwood, north of here,
a f reightcar was started by " the .vio
lent wind and was going at a rapid
pace when it collided . witji a, freight
train. The car, was demolished. There
are washouts along the railroad north
and south of here and no trains ar
rived to-day. At noon the storm ' had
abated and the sun was shining. The
rainfall was four and a half inches.

BERKELEY, March 10. â Professor
C. L. Corey, chairman of the student
affairs committee of the University of
California, made the official statement
to-night to senior class members that
any student who took part in the
charter day rush will be expelled from
the university.
Warns Against Hush.
This is the rflrst time in its history
that Santa Rosa has been cut off from
outside communication. Trains . may
get through from San Francisco to
night with mail and papers. â¢
SANTA ROSA, March 10.â The storm
that broke here last night continued
until 10 o'clock, thi^ ; morning without
abatement and was the heaviest known
in several years. The rain was ac
ccmpanled by high winds and consider
able damage is reported. Up to 7
o'clock to-night no trains had entered
Santa Rosa on either road, and al
though the early morning Southern Pa
cific passenger train left as usual It
did not succeed in getting through. A
big landslide is reported on the Guer
neville branch arid also on the main
line of the California Northwestern
near Cloverdale. The down train was
stalled between here and Petaluma all
day.
The only passenger from the north
to-day ' was A. Korbel, a well-known
wine and lumber man, who came down
from Korbels Station as far as Fulton
on a handcar and walked from there
in, hoping to get a train to San Fran
cisco. Santa Rosa Creek is higher to
day than for sixteen years and numer
ous small bridges and culverts are re
ported washed out in various parts of
the county. The railroad bridge here
is in a dangerous condition., Electric
wires grounded last night and the town
was in totatt darkness while : the storm
was at its net eht.
Trains Cease Running and Electric
Wires Arc Grounded.
SANTA ROSA ISOLATED.
Word cornea to the Independent to

the storm.
similarly. All- over the city trees tf
age and strength fell before the heavy
wind. Half a score of prominent build
ings, the Giesea block, the
Children's Home and the Angels Iron
Works, were unroofed or damaged.
Windmills y and tankhouses went down
by the score. In the lumber yard dis
trict great timbers, were picked up and
carried considerable distance. Tele
graph and telephone wires went* down
and the streets were rendered danger
ous by the mass of electric power wires
that fell or became entangled with
others. Street cars stopped. Plate
glass windows were smashed to pieces.
Flying signs, cornices and loose debris
made the streets dangerous.
The river steamers from San Fran
cisco due this morning did not get in
until late this afternoon, but they had
no mishaps. Wires to Bouldin Island
are down, but the steamers that passed
the island this morning report that the
wind was sweeping water over the
levees, but that no breaks had oc
curred. Â¦ r

Professor Vail Illustrated his lecture
with a chart,, showing the differences
in the area, population, revenue, na
tional debt, merchant marine and arm
ies and navies of the two powers now
at war in the Far East.
Japan Poon realized that unless Russia was
checked 6hc would end by seizing: Korea, sub-
JuKatinK' CHlna and driving Japan from both
these countries. So Japan prepared for war,
and when It was apparent that KuÂ«nla difl not
intend to withdraw her troops from Manchuria,
as the Muscovites had promised to do, Japan
In defense of her own interest!", n-sorted to
force of arms. I pity the Czar of Russia, for
I believe that he Is an honest man. Russia,
however, Is not ruled by the Czar, but Â£y t
corrupt aristocracy, and In that fact lies the
cause of the nresent war, which, on the part
of Jaoan, is not a war of' conquest, but a de
fense of her own liberty and her commerlcal
interests. We may 'sympathize with Russia,
but wo must acknowledge the justice of the
stand taken by Janan. - .
At the end of Japan's war with China
Japan was, according: to the treaty, to have
the Llaotung peninsula, the chief port of
which Is Port Arthur, but th* EuroDean na
tion* would not allow this, and sho was forced
to accept a war indemnity and the island of
Formosa. Shortly afterward Russia seized
Port Arthur. as> her treaty with China stated,
for twenty-five years. But Russia Immedi
ately Fi>?nt millions of rubles In fortifying
that port, which did not look ax if her occupa
tion was to be limited to twenty- five years,
and her occupation of Chinese territory has
Eteadily continued. . . . Â¦; . .
OAKLAND, March 10.â "Should Rus
sia be victorious in the conflict now be
ing waged in the Far East, Manchuria
will be closed to American trade," de
clared Professor M. S. Vail of the Meth
odist College of Tokio, Japan, in a lec
ture given at the missionary conference
of the First Baptist Church at the Ma
sonic Temple this evening. The subject
of Professor Vaii's address was "The
Signification of the Present Russo-Jap
anese Conflict."
Professor Vail has been for more than
twenty years closely associated with
the Japanese, having been sent out as a
professor in the Christian schools .of
the empire by the Methodist Missionary
Society. He has visited nearly "every
city of Importance in Japan and is qual
ified to judge the merits of the ques
tions at issue in the present struggle.
In his discourse this evening Professor
Vail told, of the rapid development of
Japan and of her great strides in the
march of progress. He said:
It Elves me great pleasure to speak a word
In behalf of Japan, for never has any nation so
well deserved the sympathy of nations In a
struggle for life and independence. Since the
opening of the empire to the commerce of the
world ty Commodore Perry the Japanese, have
Ftrlvcn unceasingly for better things, and they
have nobly succeeded. America haa been a
treat factor in the making of new Japan, and
the Jarianese thoroughly realize thlf. The
postal service of the empire, now one of the
most nerfect In the world, was Introduced by
an American Minister. Judge Blngham of Ohio.

Charlie Fong, a notorious Chinese,
gamed his release from the County
Jail this morning upon a technicality
whlch opens the Jail doors to twenty
four other prisoners confined there..
Fong was sentenced to six months in
the County Jail upon a" charge of
vagrancy. As soon as he was taken
there a writ of habeas corpus was sued
out by Attorney Fred Button, who
made the point that under the Whitney
act Police Judges in cities having a
population of between 30,000 and 100,000
are restricted to sending prisoners to
the City Prison.
For nine years the Police Judges of
this city h'ave been sentencing prison
ers to the County . Jail without this
point having been' raised, and It is
probable that other cities coming under
the name rule are open to the same
mistake. Under a decision of the Su
preme Court the Whitney act takes
precedence over the general law in
those cities where the rule applies. In
that act the powers of Police Judges
are defined, and they only have power
td send prisoners to the City Prison.
After a careful examination of the
law in the matter Judge Hall was con
vinced that the point was well taken,
and he ordered the release of Fong.
The following prisoners now confined
thenk come under the same ruling and
can gain their release in the same man
ner: Sam Levenbein, Peter Knuth, Ed
na Wallace, Albert Peterson. Mamie
Sullivan. Edwin McHaight, Cato Moore,
Delia Wright, Ella Miller, Bart Thayer,
Henry Bethune, Ray Parsons. Herman
Stumpf, Henry Hynes, William F.

and forty hundredths inches was re
corded during that time. An abun
dance of feed for stock and average
crops are now assured. All sections of
the county report rainfalls ranging
from two to three inches.
- The hot winds of the last two or
three days had caused considerable
uneasiness among the farmers, as it
was feared no moisture would be left
in the soil and that both feed and
crops would become a total loss, but
to-day'8 precipitation allays all fears
and brings rejoicing in all sections.

SALINAS, March 10.â The heavy wind
storm from the. BouthT.est hit Salinas
Valley about midnight last night and
continued until this forenoon. Since
then showers have fallen at intervals.
The past twenty-four hours will show
that an inch of rain has fallen around
Salinas. Reports from the lower por
tions of Monterey County indicate the
precipitation was heavier there. Up to
noon to-day San Lucas had "more
than an inch of rain, ' with prospects
for much more*. Around Monterey and
along the coast the downpour has been
much heavier and was accompanied by
a fierce gale that uprooted trees and
blew down fences and outbuildings.
With the present storm has disap
peared all fears of a poor season.
Throughout the Salinas Valley and
especially toward the San Luis Obispo
line the precipitation of the past month'
has been far above, the average. The
clear warm weather of the past two
weeks has caused a wonderful growth
in vegetation. The feed on the hills
around San Lucas, San Ardo, Bradley
and the cattle and sheep sections never
looked better. The hills are covered
with young green grass and feed is
abundant.
In the Salinas Valley fanners who
have lived here for forty years predict
a record-breaking season. "While the
acreage may. not be as. large as usual,
owing to the lateness of the season,
cereals of every sort are growing with
wonderful rapidity. The soil has not
lost a bit of the rains and the warm
weather and lack of wind has quick
ened growth. From King City north to
the mouth of the Salinas River there
will be an unusually large beet acreage.
As late rains are most needed in beet
raising, the prospects could not be bet
ter. While the season's rainfall is below,
the average, Monterey County pros
pects In all branches of agriculture
never looked better. The late rains and
warm weather have benefited crops in
all sections of the county. The lower
portion of the county has received a
plentltude of rain, and a general pros
perity is assured for th/Â» coming season.

The trial of the divorce suit of Eliza
Barrie against Alexander C. Barrie, a
commercial traveler, was begun before
Judge Ogden to-day. Mrs^ Barrie al
leges cruelty. The parties are residents
of Berkeley and the case has attracted
considerable attention on account of
the charges made by Mrs. Barrie
against her husband. She allages that
she has been caused great mental an
guish by the fact that she v/as confined
in a* sanitarium for four months and
not allowed to see her sister or her
child. She gained her release through
a writ of habeas corpus sued out by
her sister, Miss Herrlck.
Barrie says she was sent to the hos
pital upon the advice of reputable phy
sicians, and that he had to pay $150 a
month for her treatment out of a salary
of $300. Her sister was not allowed to
visit her on account of the fact that
she was a nervous, excitable woman,
and it was deemed best not to allow
them to be together.
The contest, however, Is not sp much
over the divorce itself as for the cus
tody of their 15-year-old daughter. This
side of their differences overshadows
that of who is entitled to the decree.

Professor Frank Soule, dean of the

University of California, returned to
day from Sacramento, after having
been in consultation with . Governor
Pardee, Marsden Manson and C. E.
Grunsky, the San Francisco engineers,
over the alarming conditions that pre
vail on account of the overflow of the
Sacrarr.ento River. Governor Pardee
is anxious to do something to relieve
the Sacramento of its burden of flood
waters and so called in these eminent
engineers lo listen to. their advice.
â¢We had a talk with the Governor,"
said Professor Soule to-day, "and told
him what it would be necessary to do
in order to relieve the situation. We
d!d not inspect the river, as we are
ali familiar with its condition and the
things necessary to be done to keep it
within its borders when the floods
come. We simply pointed out to Gov
ernor Pardee the places that ought to
be Ftrenpthened with levees, the chan
nels widened or the course of the river
straightened."
The work which Governor Pardee
will undertake will be carried on with
the aid of r>n appropriation of $250,000
that was made by the last Legislature
for improvement in the river. Not all
the money may be spent on the Sacra
mento River, but the Governor prom
ises! to use what he may to the best
advantage.

Belvedere, the promontory city,

Early Thursday morning the residents

when It was seen that many of the

CHICAGO. March 10.â At the sitart of the
B<-.Â»rd of Trade to-day the higher Liverpool
cables had a strengthening Influence on wheat:
May opened j;,- lower to Vsc higher at !Â»2fic
to H3c, while July was up 'j^Vic at SS'jc to
fiS%c. A report that rain during the night
had broken the drouth in Kansas soon (started
a selllLg movement and prices gradually de
clined. May sold off to 01 " 4 c and July to
*7Â»ic. In sp!te of rain In Kansas the price
of wheat at Kansas City experienced a sharp
advance..
Covering by shorts who were filled with
anxiety in regard to the forthcoming Govern
ment crop report emphasized the bullish sen
timent decidedly. May advanced to 94c. a gain
of 2'ic from the low point. July sold up to
R914<589%c. The market closed strong, with
May at Vtlc. the highest point of the day, and
July at S9ms*9i,;c. '
As a result of cables the corn market opened
in guile steady fashion, but weakness soon
developed. The. closing was strong and at
the top price Â«f the day. May closed at 02'io
and July at SOijc.
Oats were weaker on heavy sellir.ee by the
leading longs. The market closed strand ami
aln;oÂ« at the lop, with May at 41 and July
39!jc.
In sympathy with a decline In prices of
hogs the provision market ruled easier early
in the day. Wxih the improved tone in the
grain markets there was an Investment de
mand for hoc product*. The c!oÂ«e showed
Klislu rains throuehcut the liiÂ»t. .May pork

NEW TORK; March 10.â To-day's business
on the Btock Exchangetvai the smallest in
years. The slight increase la the markets
animation thus far this w*ek gave way to
practically stagnation to-day. A large, pro
portion of the day's business is usually done
in the first hour of the E6selon. owing to the
accumulation ir. offices of orders over night.
To-day the flnÂ«t hour's transactions amounted
to only ::0.f)00 shares. There were Ions inter
vals of total idleness and son-.e minutes be
tween single transactions. The day's nalea o f
??e,COO shares on August 22. 19CO. was the low
record for many years past. To-day's sales
aggregate 7.1.8'JO shares. Professional trad
ers entertain very Kloomy views of the out
look. There was some hope that the declÂ»tv&
improvement in Iron trade conditions would
revive some interest in the stock rnarkft. It
proved to be worth % of a pomt to United
Ktates Steel preferred, , which was enly tempo
rarily held. Thte wal one of the most con
spicuous movements in the market and is a
commentary on the day's business. The mar
ket closed dull.
There was not such utter staznatlon in
bonds as in FtocUs. but that section was very
dull and made no movement of importance
Total sales, r>w value. $1S9,COO.

The circular of Henry Nordllnger * C*^
tsuSer <ste of New Tork. March 1, says:
â¢â¢Shortly after ire Issued our last report,
a thorough change in the speculative senti
ment on tour local market took place. Prices
crumbled away with a rapidity which was as
tonishing. Enormous blocks were thrown over
board indiscriminately, and the advance Wtolch
took three month* In bulldin* up was wiped
out in *o many days.
â¢â¢T\"Â» were asked for the re*Â»on which le<3
to this sudden collapse in prlcÂ«. One reason
is thought to have been the revival of com
petition between two most Important Interests
In thif country which were before thought to
have be*n working in harmony. Another rea
son, ascribed is that one of our large roasters
who had failed to Â«ecurÂ« all the coffee needed
for hie requirement* recognized the over
bought speculative position on our market In
combination with th* dangerous position Â»p*cu
lat^ra brought upon themselves In another com
modity, and grasped this oportunlty to break
thÂ« market for the purpose of shaking- out
tbese speculative holdings and of obtaining a
fciK line of actual coffee at proportionately low
price? Whichever of these two versions
mny h* correct if immaterial now. The lacts
â¢ rÂ«> that thÂ» instigators of the decline have
r*rn eminently successful In their movement.
sr-ri this success was solely due to the flan
gcro-js speculative position in which the mar
Â¦la calmly looking over the field we find
that the present and profipecttT* position of
a<;ual coffee has not charged In the leaÂ«
from what it was a month ago; facts are.
hnwever, for the. time being, entirely ignored.
Let us co back to the time the advance In
rrkÂ«? was started; this was last August on
ibÂ« proposition that the 19C3-4 Rio and Santos
crop would amount to only between 12.000,000
nn'i l.".0<Â«0.000 bags. Later on the price In
creased step by step with each reduction of
thÂ» probable outturn of the crop, until a
iÂ»aÂ«onable assurance was had that It would be
only about 10.500.000 baps. Then the bigh
*n"rnce was reached. ThÂ« actual conditions
with regard to the extent of the crop are not
na? lota different from what they were a
month ago. Nevertheless speculation may
force the market etlll lower, especially at this
tim*-. wticti sentiment has been so thoroughly
shaken: but supply and demand are bound to
legulat?' values eventually and for this reason
wo do not hesitate to recommend laying In
Â»t'Â»cks and not missing the present oppor
tunity of doing so at a safe basis of price.
TIJE STATISTICAL, glTTATION.
"The receipts at Rio and Santos up till now
Â«re about 600.000 bags smaller than for the
fame time last >ear, and the Indications are
that the. falling off in the receipts for the
remainder of the crop year will bÂ« about 50
7*r fÂ»r.t as compared with lart year. On the
o;her hand, receipts of other kinds fexclusl\-e
r.f Rio and Santo*> have been eo far about
l.noo.iioo bags larger than last year, but they
should show a falling off from now on be
< ausÂ»> the Central American crops, as well as
the Java crops, are very much smaller than
ia*i year. â¢'.â¢;
"The d>]iv*riri= >n Europe md the United
States are about 7r.a,OOit bags larger than last
year, which i* a fair offset to the increase in
the receipts <Â»f Mild*. Bahias and Victorias.
â¢â¢We estimate the receipts of Slllds in Eu
rop* and the United States during the next
four months at about 2.<TftO,000 bags, the re
<-MpÂ»s st Rio and Santos about 1.500.0(10 bags,
total le/ceir-ts S.5OO.O0O bags. The consumption
during these four month* can safely be cal
< u'.ated at 5.0CÂ«i.<j0<> bags, therefore we can
rraconaV'y expect to s~e a reduction In the
visible FuriplJ" of 1.500.0<iO bajts from present
figure? by the end of the crop year. ThlÂ« is
certainly a feature which merits attention.
Jhe more *o as it mean* drawing on stock*
in consuming markets in no Â«mall measure
liurlng the coming months.
"vV> find a strong purport to our argu
ment with ref^re-n'-e to the actual T*>Â£itlon in
the fact that tli' Brazil markets hold up very
firm in of the weriou* break in consum
ing markets. If tne artual position â that Is.
the extent of th<= present end next crop â were
In-mical to higher market values, we should
think that tlie n*arkets in the producing coun
tries wouM he the first to *how weakness, or
\vcu!d ft any rste quickly respond to the de
cline established. Hut it !â¢ a still stranger
feature that Â»t a rri>~e of l@1-ic a lb higher
ihan our market, which has been the prevail
ing disparity jn Uraxil during the last two
or three weeks, purchases are being made for
United States' account. We ask ourselves nat
urally â Who is buying in the producing mar
ket* at such a disparity of values? It is
certs inly nÂ« the dealer for h'.s requirements.
It rnuÂ«t be. the large roaster* who cannot ob
. tain the grajSe of Koods they need on our
markÂ«t. and while they are nominally quot
ing a low price for same, are actually buying
at the same time at a so much higher price

-After the conference Secretary Taft
said that it had .been called to consider
the possibilities of steam and electrio
railroad development in the Philip
pines; that no other enterprises were
discussed and that no conclusion had
been reached.
"These gentlemen," said the Secre
tary, "have been here at my invitation
to talk over the conditions which may
attract capital to the Philippines. We
want to get capital to go over there and
help develop the islands."
"What was the disposition of the
capitalists?" he was asked.
"Well, I must say they are not biting
quite, as hard as we would like. Still,
some of them have displayed interest."
He admitted that the purpose of the
conference was to get information for
use in framing laws regarding fran
chises which would give the Philippine
Commission further powers looking to
the proper development of the Islands.
"The information we have been getting
to-day is to be used . in drafting the
bills that may be'put before Congress."
he said.
He said there was no desire to make
the concessions too liberal.
"While to-day's conference was lim
ited to the subject of railroads," said
the Secretary, "it is not the intention
to limit development In the Philippines
to these industries. It was at first the
intention to confer on steamship routes
and lines, too, but it was decided not
to do this to-day."
Taft, who left for Washington to
night, said he would make a report _pn
the subject to a Congressional commit
tee Saturday next.

There are figures of more than 100
war horses and Indians in gaudy war
bonnets on this blanket, and the shapes
are really good, considering that the
Indian artist never saw such a thing as
an artist's "stretcher," but merely hung
his cotton "canvas" on the tall sage
brush and the sides Of his wickiup.
It took him a year to complete the
picture, and he presented it to Colonel
Redington when the latter attended a
powwow and war dance of .the Ban
nacks at the Fort Hall agency a few
years ago. The red man had not forgot
ten that the white boy used to divide
"hardtack" with him in the hungry
days at the front, when supplies had j
run out and food was very scarce.
In the war with Chief Joseph's Nez
Perces in 1877, during which that part
of the regular army stationed in the
Department of the Columbia pursued j
the hostiles for more than J500 miles j
over the roughest parts of North Amer-
Icai Colonel Redington served as a
,scout under Captain Fletcher, who was i
then in the regular army on General
Howard's staff. Among the scouts was
a party of wild Bannack Indians under
Buffalo Horn, who came out to help
the whites clean up their red brethren
of the Nez Perce tribe. These same
Bannacks went on the warpath against
the whites the next year and raided all
over Idaho and Eastern Oregon.,-
The war blanket is really historic. It
represents a skirmish that actually
happened in the wild Yellowstone coun
try during the Nez Perce war, when
the Bannacks tried -to set the Nez
Perces afoot, but instead of stealing
the enemy's horses they lost most of
their own.
As an art center San Francisco at- j
tracts some of the best work of some"!
of the best artists of all nations. And i
now, as a variation, it has acquired a j
painting by the wildest kind ot a wild i
Indian â a pioneer member of the war- j
ring Bannack tribe of Idaho, now j
named Oid-Man-Who-Walks-On-Hls- ]
Feet. He has accumulated that name j
on account of having become so crip- j
pled that he cannot sit a horse any !
more. Having been shot all to pieces in j
campaigns against both white and red !
men, and not being able to engage in j
any more horse stealing raids, he has j
now taken up art. !
His creation Is a large war blanket !
which he painted on common cotton
cloth, his colors being made with In- {
dian dyes, berry juices and the vermil- j
lion with which Indians paint their J
faces. This war blanket has been lent !
to Captain R. H. Fletcher, curator of
the Mark Hopkins Art Institute, in or- .
der that local artists may have an op- j
portunlty to examine and comment on
it, for it is an artistic curio. It was
brought to town by Colonel J. W. Red- I
ington of Tacoma, its owner, who has
refused all sorts of offers for it and
would not swap it for the finest canvas
on any wall in the country.

erty owners.
The committee decided to make a

Acting under instructions from the
United States Attorney General, United
States District Attorney Woodworth
took the preliminary steps yesterday
to appeal to the United States Supreme
Court the habeas corpus case of Lee
Wing: Chung and have the question
decided whether the action of the Com
missioner of Immigration in denying
a landing to a Chinaman claiming to
be a native American is final, or
whether it is reviewable on habeas
corpus by the Federal courts.
United States Court Commissioner
Heacock filed his report yesterday with
United States District Judge de Haven
to the effect that the evidence had con
vinced him that Lee Wing Chung was
a native American and was entitled
to be landed, notwithstanding the ad
verse action of the Commissioner of
Immigration. Duncan E. McKinlay, on
behalf of the Government, filed a de
murrer to the report of the Commis
sioner and cited the decisions of Judge
Ray of New York and Judge^ Wheeler
of Vermont to the effect that the ac
tion of the Commisslo'ner of Immigra
tion in, such cases is final and not re
viewable.
Judge de Haven took the demurrer
under advisement. He has already held
in another case, and the United States
Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth
Circuit has held likewise, that a native
American desiring to return to his
country from a foreign land and being
prevented from doing so without due
process of law and on that ground ap
plying to a United States court for a
writ of habeas corpus is entitled to
have a judicial determination of the
facts, and no act of Congress can be
understood as a bar ta such judicial
determination. t
United States Circuit Judge Morrow
has also rendered a similar decision.
Judge Cook then ordered the County
Clerk to appear at the afternoon ses
sion with the general jury box, as his
venire at present contains but thirty
two names and there is no possibility
of securing a trial jury in this case
from such a small list. One hundred
men were selected and will be notified
to appear to-morrow morning, when
those who wish to be excused will have
an opportunity to be heard. The ac
tual work of selecting jurors will be
gin at 10 o'clock Monday morning and
will probably occupy the greater por
tion of the week.
The case was set for 10 o'clock yes
terday morning, but Judge, attorneys
and witnesses waited until 11 (/'clock
before the accused woman was ush
ered Into the courtroom. Her entry
was not like that of a condemned crim
inal about to make a last stand for
liberty, but, neatly dressed in a close
fitting suit of black, with a bunch of
violets pinned to her boscrm, she swept
through the courtroom and took a seat'
by her attorney, as miladi coming into
church with a new gown during the
middle of the sermon goes to her pew.
Once seated, however, she became rest
less and her eyes wandered furtively
from time to time toward the District
Attorney's desk and then at the motley
throng of curious sightseers who filled
the courtroom.
As there are but thirty-two jurors
on the present panel it was deemed
advisable to augment the list, both
sides being satisfied that it would, be
impossible to select twelve men from
such a small list. District Attorney
Byington suggested that the Sheriff
summon a number of men suitable for
jury duty, but to this Attorney Knight,
far the defense, vigorously objected,
stating that he had had experience with
such talesmen and found they were
"too suitable."
Mrs. Cordelia Botkin, once convicted
of killing Mrs. John P. Dunning, by
sending a box of poisoned candy
through the mails, appeared in Judge
Carroll Cook's court yesterday morning
for a retrial of the case. During thn
four years of her imprisonment in the
Branch County Jail Mrs. Botkin has
not wasted away. On the contrary,
her form, which never could have been
described as sylph-like, has increased
in bulk.

Jennie Rosky, who was caught In the
act of preparing to jump into the bay,
informed Judge Mogan that she could
not remember exactly the number of
previous offenses for which she had
been sentenced by him. She could
swear it was not Ices than twenty-five,
but would not make oath it was less
than fifty. Of one thing she had no
doubt, however, and that' was her
mental condition when she â¢ sought a
watery grave. She had been drinking
beer.
"It seems to me," Jennie," said the
court, "that in your case the small in
stallments plan pf imprisonment is a
proven failure, for you b'j up here as
regularly a* you are released, taking

Several witnesses informed Judge
Cabaniss that John Trapy drunk 13
hardly tojbe identified as John Tracy
sober, so grievously does alcoholic stim
ulation metamorphose the man's nat

mony was adduced in extenuation of
the ferocity with which John Tracy had
attacked Policemen Ryan and Tata
when they attempted to arrest' him for
driving at illegal speed a horse and
wagon which "belonged to him. So vic
iously did the Inebriated teamster as

Jane Dillon and William -A. Gran
field yesterday had their second in
ningr within a month before Judge Ca
baniss. On their flrst ; appearance,
abount a month ago, the man was de
fendant and the woman complainant,
but yesterday the conditions were re
versed and she stood charged with dis
turbing the peace.
The parties live in the 100 block of
Fremont street, and when Mr. Gran
field was arrested for assaulting Mrs.
Dillon, she alleged that he had slapped
her face after he had subjected her
to oral ab'use. In his defense, Mr.
Granfield stated that Mrs. Dillon had
publicly said unkind things about his
treatment of Mrs. Granfield; that
when he went to ask for an explana
tion he .met her carrying home the
family "growler," and that instead of
expressing: contrition for what she had
said about him, she repeated the in
dictment and added a few counts to
it. As there appeared to have been
provocation- for the assault, and as
Mrs. Dillon had not been seriously in
jured, the court dismissed the com
plaint and advised the parties to inter
tfVe hatchet.
Prom the narrative unfolded by Mr.
Granfield yesterday, in substantiation
of his charge, it would seem that in
stead of. obeying the judicial injunc
tion, Mrs. Dillon inaugurated a.cru
sade of persecution against him that
made his life a burden. She had gone
to his employers, he stated, .'and in
formed them, that he was, to put it
mildly, a domestic tyrant, and in other
ways she had systematically i en
deavored to "knock" his reputation.
As the defendant was not entirely
prepared to refute these accusations,
the case was continued at her request.
"We cannot have this court trifled
with by these people," said the Judge,
sternly surveying the bevy of
negresses, "and we cannot have police
effort discouraged by dismissing the
complaint against this defendant, of
whose guiltr^hs charged, there is no
question. We will see if a way can
not be found to give justice her due
in this case, despite the failure of the
complaining ""witness to prosecute."
As the disappointed Mr. Jackson
was returned to durance, Miss La
more wept and the othÂ»r. ladies shot
sympathetic glances, at him.
All this was adduced in the face of
Policeman ' F. H. Flynn's statement
that he had been told by Miss Lamore
of Ihe assault and the other witnesses
had assured him that Jackson had
smashed the vaseâ fragments pro
duced in evidence â upon her cranium.
Prosecuting Attorney Harris despair
ingly " told the bench that there had
evidently been a settlement of the
dase out of court, but Judge Fritz
abruptly dispelled the grin of hope
that was supplanting Mr. Jackson's
scowl by ordering a continuance until
to-morrow.
and as Mr. Jackaon sat in the court of
Frite yesterday morning he certainly
looked as if the couplet .fitted him.
He was very black of face and very
burly, of figure, and his attire was
positively noisy. With a steady scowl
he 'watched a dark cloud of feminine
witnesses swear that to the best of
their knowledge and belief he had al
ways dwelt In amity with his "gal,"
Blanche Lamore, and that he did not
smash a heavy glass vase by smiting
her on the head with k. Miss La
more herself, after a shrinking glance
at Thomas, falteringly^ stated that she
" 'membered nuthin' whatsoever 'bout
it, kase both she an' Mlstah Jackson
had bin a-drinkln' togither."

There was no paucity of witnesses in
the case of Henry von Arx, accused of
having failed to return a $50 suit of
clothes he had taken from J. L,. Cun
ningham on January 26 for the avowed
purpose .of having the Â¦ garments
cleaned. Von Arx was employed by a
clothing renovatbry at the time, and
several inmates of the house in which
Cunningham dwelt testified that . the
clothes had been taken away, as stated
In the complaint, while other witnesses
as positively contributed to the alibi
that was set up by the defense. As the
preponderance of testimony was with
the defendant . the court gave him the
benefit of the reasonable doubt of his
guilt that was established. .
An Impassioned plea by Attorney
Mack failed to persuade Judge Fritz to
grant a continuance in the case of J. S.
Reed, a young fellow accused of obtain
ing money by false pretense, the com
plainants being Whittler, Fuller & Co.
The attorney declared he had witnesses
in reserve and desired time to produce
them, but the court thought ample time
had already been afforded for that pur
pope. . *
"Then we. ask for sentence now," said
the attorney.
. "Sixty days In the County Jail," said
the Judge. . .
Judge Fritz continued the case of R.
H. Hoag, accused of felony embezzle
ment, specific charge being that he
appropriated to his own use a gold
watch, chain and charm belonging to
M. Aronsohn of 620 Market street.
Angelo Debenchenzi, teamster, hurled

It developed that the enmity between
the Kaflishes and the McEacherns had
been in active eruption since about a
year ago,_when the head of the latter
family was accused of having attempt
ed to assault the Kaflish girl. He was
held to the Superior Court, where a
jury acquitted him, and on the stand
yesterday he swore that ever since his
acquittal the Kaflishes have flung in
sult and rocks at him whenever he
ventured abroad. On the other hand,
the Kaflishes swore that the c efendant
seldom missed opportunity to address
offensive remarks to and utter threats
against Miss Kaflish, and it was for
the purpose of having him silenced
that they caused his arrcat.
The jury took Into consideration the
evidence, the attorneys' fervid argu
ments and the Judge's charge, and in
half an hour reported Inability to agfee
and was discharged.

Twelve women from Belden placs
were accused before Judge Mogan of
being inmates of disorderly houses.
Eight of then pleaded guilty and the
remaining four declined to plead.
It was to secure evidence 4hat the
houses from which the women were
taken are of disorderly character that
the arrests were 'made and the pris

testimony thus obtained is reserved
for the Superior Court, where effort Is
being made to prove that the houses
in Belden place are rented for immoral
purposes.

"The Power of the Cartoon," most
aptly illustrated by pen and speech,
was the subject of a lecture by the fa

Lyric Hall last night. With anecdote
and portrait of the many famous sub
jects of his skill, Mr. Davenport
whiled away a most entertaining two
hours. Admiral Dewey, William Glad
stone,* Mark Hanna and Sam Rainey
were among Mr. Davenport's portrait
gallery, each sketched with laughable
life-likenesses, three or four times life
size, and in a period of not longer
than three minutes. The artist's sto
ries, delivered in a droll drawl, and
most quaintly told, are all good, those
about bird-life, in which he is deeply
interested, being full of a charming
pathos and humor. There will be an
other lecture to-morrow afternoon at
Lyric Hall, and it can be warmly rec
ommended to every class of hearers.

The correspondence of the committee shows
a decided increase In February over previous

committee has been in active operation 41,479
letters have been received, .83,209" letters have
been sent out and 672,187 pieces of literature
It is gratifying to note that the. committee
Is *in receipt of large numbers of letters from
people who have come to the State and ex
press themselves as thoroughly satisfied with
their surroundings. These people prove the
best advertisers that California can have and
are the means of bringing their friends here
also.

a marked Â¦ increase In the number of large in

enables the new-comer to secure tracts on
reasonable terms. One of the most notable
and recent instances of actual success is the
development of the Turlock and the Modesto
Irrigation districts, which obtain their water
from the big La Grange dam. These districts
were carried out along the provisions of the
Wright law to absolute and final- success,
bringing 2C0.00O acres of land under the pos

breaking up of big ranches, makes two moet

Ttry nearly set me crazy, the skin wonld

tried everything that I was told to nse
for folly three years, bat could get no
relief. I tried at least eight different
doctors,- bat none of them seemed to do
me any good, as my hands were as bad
when I got through doctoring as when
I first began. I also tried many reme-
dies, but none of them ever did me one
cent's worth of good. I was discour-
aged and hear t-6ore. I would feel so
bad mornings when I got up, to think
I had to go to work and stand the pain
for ten hours, and I often fdt like giv-
ing up my position. Before I started
to work morniDgs I would hare to
wrap every finger up separately, so
as to,try and keep them soft, and then
wear gloves over | the rags to keep
