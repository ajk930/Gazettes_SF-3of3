FIGHT DUEL,
WITH KNIVES
OVER WOMAN
Hospital Employes
in Desperate
Combat
Each Receives Several
Thrusts, but None
Are Serious.
Rivalry in Courtship Leads
to Agreement to Meet on
Field of Honor.
For the love of a girl Joseph Stelner
of 1470 San Bruno avenue and Edward
Reynolds, 1447 Utah street, fought a
desperate duel with knives last night
ii. the rear of the CJty and County Hos
pital, where they work. The timely
arrival of several other employes of
the institution prevented the combat
from ending fatally, thougrh each of
the duelists indicted gashes in the
other.
There has been ill feeling between
the two for some time. They are both
young men, Reynolds being 25, while
"his antagonist is five years his junior.
A fair maid whose heart both aspire to
win has caused bad blood between them
and the feeling had become so bitter
that they decided to settle the matter
with knives.
The combatants retired to the rear of
the hospital building and with, drawn
\u25a0weapons btgan to settle the question ot
eupremacy. The battle was raging- fu
riously, with every prospect of a fatal
tJirust ending Jt, .when .taeJr fellow em
ployes overpowered the rival lovers. Both
xntn were bleeding badly from wounds
they had sustained. .
Steiner was stabbed several times In
both arms, while Reynolds was suSering
from gashes in the back. Both men were
taken to the operating-room of the City
and County Hospital and treated by Dr.
Alvares. Every effort was made by the
attendants and officials of the hospital to
suppress the matter.
The police took a hand, and after \u25a0 the
men had been treated they were taken
to the Mission station. While on the way
there they clashed again in the patrol
wagon, but were subdued. A charge of
assault with a deadly weapon was placed
egainst each of them.
fc MAKES A TEEEIBLE
THIP OVEK 2HE ICE
Engineer First to 3lake the
Journey From Dawson
to Fairbanks.
VANCOUVER. B. C Dec. 7.â A spe
cial from Dawson says George Kenne,
chief engineer of the steamer Seattle
No. 3, is the first man to arrive over
the Ice from Fairbanks. He was twen
ty-six flays making the trip. He had
a terrible time, having escaped death
so often that the mere plunge in the
river far from a habitation became al
snost a dally occurrence. At one
time, near Circle City, while trying
to reach a roadhouse, the jam
rtarted. and Kenne says he cannot un
derstand how he ever grot off that
grinding*, twisting ice field. He says
that for eighty miles above Circle City
the ieÂ« is piled from ten to thirty feet
high. 3
He reports but little grub in the
Cantlshna country and none whatever
in the Delta country, in the latter dis
trict the men who did not have outfits
for the winter had to go to Fairbanks.

New Method-Suc

Sandbag* Jobs.
Ride Up to Victim and Strike
Him and Make a Swift
Escape From Scene.
For the last week two highwaymen
mounted on bicycles have been sandbas-
I gins citizens In the Mission District and
j easily eluding all efforts of the police to
I capture them. They ride up to their vic
j tlm, noiselessly, sandbug him before he
| can turn and escape with the spoils.
Frank Haas and Thomas Murray, visit
ing: committeemen of the Native Sons of
j the Golden West, had a thrilling experi
enco last night with the two up-to-date
; highwaymen near the bridge at Arlington
| and Mission streets.
Just as Murray and Haas were about
to cross the bridge the former happened
J to look back. He saw two men approach
j Ing on bicycles, one on each side of the
road. As the cyclers crept swiftly and
silently upon the two pedestrians -Murray
and Haas saw that their faces were cov-^
ered with blade -cloths. V
"Footpads," I whispered Murray. "Liet's
ron." '- .. - ; -\u25a0. ; \u25a0. ; .: \u25a0 .-." \> â¢]
EscapÂ« on either side "of the road :was' |
cut off, so 'the pair dashed right between
the two highwaymen. The thugs dis
mounted quickly.
"Stop, or we'll shoot," was the" order,
but the two frightened sprinters sped on.
Haas looked over his shoulder and saw !
the glint of a weapon In the .hand of one j
of the thugs. But the man dla not fire. \u2666
This pair of highwaymen are not the
sort that take chances, i They_ work si
lently and effectively. During the few
days they have been in the Mission Dis
trict no less than seven men have been
assaulted and robbed by them. Reports
of the crimes have been withheld. The
attempt to rob Haas and Murray is the
first failure recorded against the high
waymen of the wheel.
The two have neither lamp nor bell
upon their bicycles. Their method Is to
follow a pedestrian along the lonely roada
in the Mission. They keep In the shad
owe, creeping along on their silent, rub
ber-shod steeds until they are almost
alongside him. V
They ride swiftly up to their victim arid
one of them deftly sandbags him as they
dart past. They quickly relieve him of
his valuables and mounting their bicycles
are away before the bewildered victim
has recovered from the first surprise.
By the time the vicflm has reached a
phone to notify the police the highway
men arejwell out of the district, perhaps
enjoying themselves on the proceeds of
the night's work. They take his money
and steal away like wraiths m the night,
leaving the man they have despoiled
stunned and helpless in the road.
Murray and Haas were on their way to
visit James Sullivan, a sick member of
the Native Sons, when they encountered
the bicycle highwaymen. Their destina
tion was Arlington street, just above the
bridge, near where they met the thugs.
Haas gives the following story of the
meeting:
We were walking- up Arlington Â»treÂ«t and
had Just reached the bridge when Murray
happened to look, behind. - He caught my arm.
I looked and -saw two men ccorcblnc up to
ua on b!u*cles.
JnÂ«t as I turned thÂ«y were almost up to
us and I saw that they had xnaaka on. Slur
ray auggeated . that we run and I agreed to
take the chance. We â¢ran- out right between
them, dowa to Mission street. By the time
we got there they were gone. OX course when
we told the police the robbers were far away.
There have been geveral people held up
around here In the' last week by the same
fellows. We were on the lookout for them
all the time we were going to Sullivan's,
but we didn't know anything till they were
right up against us. If we had ran the
other way> they might have followed us and
got us. We did the best thing by running
back. \u25a0 -- â¢ \u25a0."\u25a0\u25a0. ..\u25a0;.;;-

Two Jewish Women Are Torn to Pieces by Rural Mobs for
Spreading Anti- Government Propaganda.
LONDON. Dec S.â The correspondent
of the Daily Telegraph at St. Petersburg,
in a dispatch dated December G, while
protesting against the "exaggerated
rumors" circulated abroad concerning the
horrors prevalent in Russia, admits that
almost anything is possible to the Russian
people in "this time of revolution!" He
blames the anarchist* -as. being largely
responsible for the existing situation, say
ing: : . .'
"Well knowing that legality will de
prive them of their occupation, they are
Tiorking night and day to plunge the
country into chaos and crime. Unfortu
nately a large section of. xhe population
Is proving so weak and irresolute that
i he country is no longer shaped by prin
ciples, but is the slave of events, and the
principal event Is the delirium of the na
tion. :
"While Count de Witte's Cabinet stands
t!iere will be hope for Russia, but when
It disappears the. deluge will begin. Even
now tlie dark clouds are gather
ing. Th*Â» pe,asants clamor for land, but
they will not hear of disrespect to the
Emperor. A large percentage of the
workmen also are incer.?ed against the
strike organizers and the revolutionists
and in some cases against the Jews."
The correspondent relates twn Instances
âone that of a beautiful Jewish girl In
the villaee of Ivanovo and another that
of a school mistress named Dooegentzeflf,'
Jn the ICulan district, both of whom were
torn to pieces by infuriated mobs for
preaching revolution. He says:
"These things make civilization shud
der, yet they are part of what is threat
ened on a large scale by the 'element of
reaction, which is gathering its forces and
which is saying: 'If the laws are obsolete
and the Government is powerless, then
tvf> f the people, will rise up and bring the
anarchists to reason. They have silenced
our Emporor and prevented him from
giving us the land. Death to them.* "
DE WITTB LOSrVG GROUND.
Public Confidence In tlie Russian Pre
nifer Is Shaken. 1
ST. PETERSBURG. Wednesday, De
cunber C (night).â Public confidence in
the Government's ability to weather the
growing storm is waning fast. Premier
do Wltte seems powerless to cope with
the new elements of danger which the
revolution is raising on every hand. New
mutinies among - the troops are con
stantly reported and the lawlessness
In Jh<> country Is increasing.
lioth the runs on the banks/ and the
demand. for foreign exchange are accel-
er^ted by circulars which the strikers
end revolutionaries are spreading broad
cast.
Alt the Ministry of Finance It is esti
mated that $50,000,000 has thus far been
â¢withdrawn from the State Bank. The
balance of gold in the treasury and
abroad now stands at $356.500,0P0, and the
outstanding paper totals $553,000.000. leav
ing thÂ« Government a margin of legally
issuable' paper of about $45,000,000.
The Government perfectly understands
the purpose of too assault on" Its. credit.
At tlie Ministry of Finance the press was
authoritatively informed that the situ
ation of the Government had not greatly
changed, financially, or economically.
"All depends," continued the offlcial,
"upon political developments. If the
Government possessed thrice its present
reserve it would not suffice to prevent the
present Â«Â«care. which, like all habits,
snust run its course. But we, have ample
resources to" meet our obligations and the
present demands. It Is nonsense to talk
of the Government defaulting the Janu
ary coupons and of Its' inability to take
up the short-term treasury bonds sold to
the Mendelssohns, wh^ch are due in Feb
ruary. Much has been made of the pos
sible inability to collect taxes In many
provinces, j As a matter of- fact, the en
tire" direct' taxation In" the'; cities and
country is $67,600,000 and. the tax on in
dustries $33,500,000. If both were alto
pcther lost it would be Ices than one
tenth of Russia's total income."
The only break In the ranks of the
trJegraphers is reported from Kazan,
Middle Russia. Elsewhere all the Gov
ernment's attempts to resume telegraphic
communication, have been unsuccessful.
In this city there was a partial resump
tion of mall delivery by. means of vol
unteers, but It requires two policemen or
two soldiers to escort each carrier. In the
postofSce the officials who can be spared
are working in other departments with
volunteers, some of whom. are\of high
rank. The Princess Obolensky, the Prin
cess of Huebin, the Countess Merinoff
end the Countess Ozeroff axe sorting let

\u25a0 AsKasaLnatlon of Sakharoff the Result
of Ills Tyranny.
ST. -PETERSBURG, Wednesday, Dec.
'\u25a0 6. â The news of the assassination of
Lieutenant General Sakharoff, former
Minister of War, who was shot in the
Governor's Palace at Saratoff on De
cember 5, had been preceded by ' the
most horrible stories of the manner In
which Sakharoff had been repressing
the agrarian* disorders. , He. corraled
peasants with Cossacks and then had
them beaten with the soldiers' whips.
In so doing-, Sakharoff" pursued the
system adopted by Prince John Obolen
sky, former Governor "General of Fin
land, in suppressing the agrarians in
the vicinity of Kharkhoff. several years
ago, when the Prince caused the peas
ants to be whipped by relays of Cos
sacks and compelled them in' turn to
beat their comrades. l
The assassin of Sakharoff has not
been identified. .When the woman who
committed the crime was arrested; she
declared that she ;had- executed a de
cree of -the terrorists section of Â» the
Social Revolutionists. ; - \u25a0-".
The following is a description of
Sakharoffs arrival at Hovbanschina,
one of the villages of the province of
Saratoff: : â¢ â¢â¢
"He came with Cossacks and ar
tillery. The peasants were surrounded
by Cossacks, and Sakharoff addressed
them, demanding that they surrender
their leaders. The village elder replied,
but gave the general no information.'
The elder .was immediately beaten "un
til he lost consciousness. Sakharoff
then retired to the court-house, leaving 1
the peasants at the mercy of the Cos
sacKs, most of whom were drunk, and
they beg-an torturing the peasants,
pulling out their hair and beards and ;
even tearing pieces 'Of flesh. from their
faces. Thirty- three 'peasants
thus maltreated."*' ~' ; v- \u25a0. ,j. < >,f T ;

According to the reports received by
the United -Railroads from their con
ductors la3t { night counterfeiters have
descended upon 1 the city, bent on flood
ing it with spurious five-dollar pieces.
Before midnight five of the bogus
gold pieceshad been turned in by con
ductors working on the Market street
lines. -Neit; came two conductors from
the Powell street road, each with a
spurious flve-dollar piece.,
;- A report was received from a conductor
on the Third and Kearny streets that a
$5 piece had been tendered Â«im that was
spurious;. He immediately discovered the
fact; and when he started toward the
passenger who had given it, the man
quickly jumped off the car and ran.
â¢ The base coin ' is 'an excellent '-. Imita-'

detected in the casual handling. A few
weeks ago tlie United Railroads found
that it had been paid many bogus 520
pieces, and it is believed the same gang
Is now floating the' smaller gold pieces.
UNITAETANS EEPfcY
TO THEIR EXCLUSION
BOSTON, Dec. 7.â A. reply to their ex
clusion as Unitarian delegates from the
inter-church conference on federation, at
New York, has been prepared by Roy. ,
Dr. Edward Everett Hale, former Gov
ernor John D. Long and Samuel A:' Eliot,
president of. the Unitarian Association,
and ; to-day this was forwarded in the
form of a letter to the pastors of all the
Unitarian churches of. Boston. It will be
read from the pulpits next Sunday. â¢ :
The delegates who had been eleoted
by , the .Unitarian National Conference
were debarred from the privilege of
taking part; in the inter-church confer
ence on the ground that their denomina
tion is, from the . standpoint of the con
ference, non-evangelical.. The address
says in part: , ,
. We were refused admission to the meeting
on the ground that Unitarians are not Chris
tians. Our characters were not impeached, but
our beliefs were condemned as heretical. In
eplte ! of the protest of the most distinguished
Christian ' scholars and leaders of other de
nominations than our own, this ; exclusion has
now been confirmed by the action of "the con
ference Itself. \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 The Unitarian churches are
definitely omitted from the- list : of the Chris
tian bodies entitled to representation In the
Federated Council of the Churches of Christ in
America. -: . \u25a0 J '
. We make no ' controversy over this action,
which 1 puts not us but Its promoters at the
bar of an enlightened public opinion.
â¢ The Unitarian churches of America, and all
who desire to promote pure Christianity in our
land be glad to be confronted by "a
stimulating challenge. Whatsoever good things
these other' denominations propose to accom
plish, and .we deeply appreciate the good they,
\u25a0do -it ;ls â¢ nranifeFt . that, ; as represented by thia*
action, they are both unwilling, and unable to;
.commit themselves to the great Christian prln-j
clples of 'freedom, and brotherhood. \u25a0. â¢.. -, - .;
"'By- fearlessly^ proclaiming the .Ideals of a

MEMBERS VOTE
TO CONSOLIDATE
The much respected Mercantile. Library,
will be merged - intb the Mechanics' Li
brary should there be no legal light to
upset the majority vote which' was, cast
yesterday for consolidation. . â¢,'â¢'*>;?"?
The voting on. the' matter of the amal
gamation beganin the morning and ran
along at intervals until" 8 o'clock in the
evening, at which hour David E. Miles, i
president of the Mercantile, declared the !
poll closed.
When the count was made it was found
.that 231 had voted for consolidation. 12S |
for. the continuance of the Mercantile and j
but five for its being taken over by tlie
Free Public Library. The total number
of votes cast was 364. ' ;
On several annual occasions this matter
of consolidation has worried the loyalists
who' stand by ( the - institution on Sutter
street with warrior T like persistence and
cannot'see a way to agree with the argu
ments advanced by those who support the
Idea of taking the valued collection over
to -"Post 6treet. f|""s ; * j >} > % . c
\u25a0V .Throughout the" ldng day the -anti-con-
j solidation members j were ; valiantly repre
sented :.by? Edmund. Marks,; ;Dr. | Samuel
O. L- Potter, Edward E. Perley and At
torney Charles F. Crosby, each of whom
Is filled with sentiment for tha -Mercan
tile.. .>;.\ :..- i â.'.- - \u25a0- , '...'.. -
. So keenly was. the fight, waged that
white haired and very old gentlemen,
who had watched the library grow from
its swaddling clothes up to an age when
some think It best to merge it into an
other institution of its kind, stood stead
fast and . sternly against . any - change
whatever. Every, possible argument in
opposition to thijse who favored consoli
dation was used.
SENTIMENT' RUXS HIGH.
Men and women were almost implored
nottovote away the cherlsted property.
Friends of half a century held argu
ment and fell out. That shows how keen
was the contest and how strong the prin
ciple on either side.
After, the result had been made known
by President Miles, that gentleman said
to a representative of The Call:
/This" means that a committee . of five* will
be appointed from each library to arrango tha
matter ot consolidation, legal or otherwise.
The commutes will bÂ« appointed by me on
Saturday at 2 o'clock.
There Is absolutely nothing . in thÂ© two
thirds vote argument- because the. vote to con
solidate with the Mechanics' Library has a
majority over both of the other propositions.
â¢ I really hope it will be taken to the courts,
which would be the - means of settling the
Question definitely. .
C. F. Crosby, a member of the Mercan
tile Library, and who opposes consolida
tion, said: \u25a0 '\u25a0 >>V
\u25a0 The first objection to \u25a0 consolidation ' !â¢ that
the purposes of the two corporations aÂ« set
forth In . their articles of Incorporation are
not alike, the Mercantile library being a
library association " and the Mechanics' In
stitute an educational , Institution formed ."for
the purpose of the promotion' of mechanical In
dustries and economic sciences."
â¢. The second objection is that If either cor
poration is to be ; considered as a non-profit
co-operative buslnwa association, then section
653 of the Civil Code governs the consolidation
and the agreement In writing signed by two
thirds of the members U necessary. Falling
this, the trustees of either corporation are not
empowered to consolidate. *.^SMS
talk of ' ixjuji encar.
Some of the old members declared that
if . the attempt should be made to con
solidate "In defiance of the law" an In
junction would be immediately applied
for.'o 'â¢,\u25a0: . - \u25a0_; :';: '; \u25a0-" \u00841 ,' â¢;"- . :
'; Livingston Jenks. chairman of the con
solidation committee for the Mechanics*
Institute;, was present during the counting
of I the : ballots, and ? when the result was
made known said: j
ThÂ« vote shows that a majority of the mem
bers ' took a ' sensible rather than a sentimental
view of the - situation, ' f preferring 'to mak*
present . provision for â¢ the \u25a0 preserving ". of. ths
usefulness - of . the library rather than ' trust to
the uncertainties of . the- future. \u25a0 ' - \u25a0
The result cf this. combination will be bene
ficial not only to the members of the Mercac
tlle > library i Association - and the . Mechanics'
Institute, but also to our city.- â¢ , .
The Mercantile members will have all thfltr

Special Dtepatch to TlJe Call.
STAMFORD, Conn., Dec. 7. â If the
Rev. George C. Richmond, curate of St.
John's Episcopal Church, has his way
the population of hades will eventually
be vastly increased by insurance mag
nates and grafters now under investi
gation in New York City.
By reason of his wholesale condem
nation of rich sinners, the parishioners
of St. John's intend to dispense with
Dr. Richmond's services. There are
many very wealthy families In the con
gregation and they object to any radi
cal selection of their future abodes by
ii curate who was supposed to guide
them gently in the proper path. -
The particular sermon -to which the
parishioners of St.- John's object was
delivered last Sunday at the memorial
service of the Elks. In effect. Dr.
Richmond said that any business man
who received a salary of $25,000 was a
thief. Richmond said to-day:
I did not realize that I was saying anything
to cause commotion or comment. I am not
sorry, I'm n ot afraid, and I have nothing to
lake back. I ehould like, however, to amplify
the remark I made to some extern. Its mean
ing should be brought out more fully.
I remember that when I was assistant in
Holy Trinity Church of New Tork there was
a young man In the church who was t-mploved
by the Equitable Life at $12 50 a week. I of
ficiated at his marriage. Two months later it
\u25a0was discovered that he had stolen $50,000 from
the company and he was sent to prison. Now.
â¢who is the greater sinner, that young man or
Hyde?
I tell you, Hyde will be in hell for eternity
ac compared with the term that young man
ehould spend there
in my remarks last Sunday I did not mean
that people prominently in the eye of the pub
lic at present were deliberately and purposely
breaking the ten commandments. I meant that
tliey were results of an evil system. But, you
know, we are using plain terms nowadays and
practically they are thieves who take that
which does not belong to uiem and which they
<!o not earn.

COMMISSIONS
PAID TO WIDOW
NEW YORK, Dec. 7. â Attention was
directed to the responsibility of crim
inal action growing out of the investi
gation of life Insurance methods by a
visit paid by District Attorney Jerome
to the legislative committee while it
was holding its hearing in the City
Hall to-day. Jerome said that he
wanted to learn when he could get
possession of a copy of the report of
the committee. Chairman Armstrong
already has said that he hopes to have
it ready for the Legislature when it
meets next January.
Counsel for Thomas F. Ryan, who
bought the James 1-L Hyde stock of the
Equitable Life Assurance Society, con
ferred with Charles E. Hughes, counsel
for the investigating committee, to-day,
and said afterward that Ryan was
holding himself in readiness to testify
before the committee.
One of the points brought out by
Hughes in to-day's hearing was the
fact that the Mutual Reserve Life In
surance Company had paid $134,000 to
the widow of Edward B. Harper,
former president of tha* 1 company,
since Harper's death in 1895. The
money is derived from commissions
which former President* Harper drew
on all the business written by the com
pany. His widow, who has since re
married, continues to receive the com
missions.
Incident to this inquiry, Hughes dis
covered an instance in which $8000
had been paid to President Frederick
A. Burnham of the Mutual Reserve Life
Insurance Company in 1896, and con
cerning- which Vice President George
D. Eldredge of .hat company testified
that he knew nothing. The book
keeper who made the payment from
the contingent fund said he did not
know what it was paid for.
The affairs of the Security Alutual
Life Insurance Company of Bingham
ton, N. V., again were 'under inves
tigation to-day. One of the interesting
features brought out was the state
ment of President Charles M. Turner
of that company that he had employed
a few years ago D. H. Keefer, "one of
the clerks In the office of the State
Superintendent of Insurance at Albany,
to act as a consulting actuary of the
Security Mutual Company, at $1500 a
year. For all Turner knew, .he said,
the arrangement was still in force..

THE SAN FRANCISCO; CALL, FRIDAY, DECEMBER^S,: 1905.
George D. Collins refused
yesterday to allow Char
lotta ,Collins to testify
against him because of the
prosecution's allegation
that she is his wife. The
prosecution claims the re
fusal is a point of vital im
portance. Collins placed
in evidence two death cer
tificates signed by Dr.
Nathan Rogers, showing
the decease of Agnes M.
"Collins" and an , infant
child of "Agnes M' and
George D. Collins."
Makes Point That Pros
ecution Holds She
Is His Spouse.
Charlotta Newman, as
He Calls Her, Kept
From Stand. "
Certificates of Death
Are Grim Exhibits
in the Case.
When the prosecution in the case
of Georgre D. Collins, accused of per
jury, sought yesterday to put Mrs.
Charlotta Newman Collins, wife of
the defendant, on 1 the stand, Collins
objected. The point he made was that,
as the prosecution was attempting to
prove that Charlotta Newmanâ as he
calls her â is Mrs. Collins, its witnesses
must be bound by. its own allegations,
and not attempt to introduce the wit
ness as the wife to testify against her
husband. Judge Lennon held that the
defendant's view of the point was cor
rect, and ordered the jury to disregard
the attempt to Dut Charlotta Collins on
the stand.
The prosecution was exultant at Col
lins' objection, thinking it equal to an
admission that the woman was hia
wife.
Florence Newman, sister of Mrs.
Charlotta Collins, was recalled and she
gave the following testimony regarding
a conversation she overheard between
Collins and his wife In the house at
2519 Pierce street last May. The testi
mony, however, was stricken out.
When he came buck,' he came in . about a
quarter after 5 and stayed till 6 and be says:
"Now. Charlotta. I don't- want you to believe
I am married." They have got. it In the papers
that I am married to this McCurdy woman
and it la not Â«rÂ» and I don't want you to be
lteve such things. I want yoii to see Willie
and tell him that no such thing ever hap
pened â that I went to Chicago' and sot mar
ried and all this and that â and I don't want
him to believe it. And < you tell Florence not
to cay a thing to the cook or any one, and I
will pay Willie all that Is comlngr to him if he
keeps his- mouth shut. Don't talk to any one
of those reporters. It. will be Tobln's delight
to see all this happen to me."
Later on Collins cross-examined Miss
Newman and found her a hard propo
sition to handle.
"After the Tom Ladd ejectment,"
asked Collins, "did not the defendant
live at the Palace, the St. Francis* and
other hotels?"
"He did." replied the ..witness, "to
make out he was a widower."
"You" did not visit the defendant In
his apartment?"
"No; .1 never had any use for the
defendant. I was taking care of my
sister's children."
"And you think it would glorify the
children to put their father in San
Quentin?" Â«
"I certainly do, after he has dis
owned his wife for another woman and
deserted his three children." \u25a0 .. \u25a0
Just before the noon adjournment
Collins secured the admission of the
death certificates of Agnes M. "Collins"
and an infant child of "Agnes M. and
George D. Collins." The greater part
of the afternoon session was spent in
an attempt by the prosecution to have
them declared inadmissible. The con
tention of the prosecution in the mat
ter of the certificates is that. Collins
told the doctor, Nathan Rogers, who
was placed on the stand, that the de
ceased woman was the wife of a broth
er. The introduction of the second cer-

DR. PIERCK'S REMEDIES.
WELCOME WORDS
. TO WOMEN.
Women who suffer with disorders peeu-
Har to their sex should write to Dr. Pierce
and receive free the advice of a physician
of over forty years' experienceâ a skilled
and successful specialist in the diseases
!of .women. Every letter has the most
careful consideration and is regarded a Â»
sacredly confidential. Many sensitively
modest women write fully to Dr. Pierce
what they would shrink from telling to
their local physician. The local physician
is pretty sura to say that? he cannot do
anything without " an examination." Dr.
Pierce holds that these distasteful exam-
inations 1 are generally needless, and that
no woman,' except in rare cases, should
submit to them.

privacy of your .home. His " Favorite

WASHINGTON, D<?e. ".âState Senator E.
F. Woodward of Santa Rosa probably will
bo appointed Surveyor of the Port of
San Francisco, to succeed Joseph F.
Cpear, whose term expires on December
3). Senators Perkins and Flint have not
yet made any recommendation to Presi
deot Roosevelt, but It is known that they
would be pleased to have Woodward take
the place, which they have practically
offered to him. It is believed here that
he will accept, and the California Sen
ators will request the President to send
his name to the Senate. Woodward has
Jjtx-n a strong political supporter of the
Genutcrs, who regard him as being espe
cially fitted for the place.
SANTA ROSA, Dec. 7.â State Senator
EL F\ Woodward of this city was consid
erably su: prised to-day when he was in-
Donned of the press dispatch from Wash
ington to the effect that he was to have
the appointment of Surveyor of Port for
Ban Francisco, to succeed Joseph F.
Spear. Woodward said it was the first
Intimation he had received of the pro
posed appointment and that he had not
one word from Senators Perkins or Flint
teearding the selection.
â¢'Senator Perkins and I have been warm
friends," said Woodward, "ever since we
were boys together in Oroville, and I have
been a warm supporter of Mr. Perkins in
all of his political campaigns. I may say
that I assisted to a considerable extent
In making it possible for Mr. Flint to be
elected at the last session of the Legisla
ture. It was probably out of friendship,
together with my services as secretary
of the State Republican Committee, which
has influenced the California Senators In
making their selection, if It is as the press
reports say. '
"I met Senator Perkins on the street in
San Francisco a couple of weeks before
he left for the East and we stopped to
chat for a moment. In parting he re
marked that he hoped that I would come
to Washington this winter for a visit,
saying he would make it very pleasant
for me in every way. I assured him that
my business engagements were such that
It would be almost impossible to make
euch a trip. He then added: . \
" 'I hope some day to do something for
you.'
"I never thought anything more about
the matter."
Senator Woodward has served two
terms as Treasurer of Santa Rosa, two
terms as Mayor and two terms as Treas
urer of Sonoma County.- Four years ago
he was elected to the State Senate. He
is president of the Union Trust Savings
Bank, one of the leading financial insti- !
tutions of Sonoma County. He has large j
land interests in Yolo County also. The |
news of the proposed appointment was i
received in this city with pleasure, as ]
Woodward Is popular In the business
community, as well as socially. %

Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL BUREAU, POST BUILDING,
WASHINGTON. Dec. 7. â Representa
tive Hayes to-day received a telegram
from A. Tveitmore, president of the
Japanese and Korean Exclusion LeagVe.
of California, requesting that he Intro
duce in the House a bill on that sub
ject prepared by the league. , . -
Mr. Hayes replied that he would be
glad to give the matter his considera
tion upon the receipt of the bill which
has not yet reached Washington. If in
his opinion it Is a better measure than
that introduced last Monday by Repre
sentative McKinlay and which has the
endorsement of the â¢ State's Congres
sional delegation, Mr. Hays will use his
efforts to have it take the place of the
original bill.
The general opinion among the Cali
fornia members, however, is that the
bill already introduced, if enacted,
j would shut out Japanese and Koreans
j without having opened the entire ques-
I tlon of exclusion and- that it is by far
the superior measure.
The prospect for favorable action on
any Japanese exclusion bill in the pres
ent Congress Is extremely remote. In
fact, it Is practically certain that' no
measure could pass either house, nor
\u25a0 is it probable that the bill now in pos-
I session of the House committee will
| ever come out of the committee- room.
j Opposition to the bill on the part of
leading Republicans of the House who
absolutely control its business Is so
strong that no action whatever upon
the measure Is at all probable.* The
members of the' California delegation
who are most strongly in favor of the
enactment of this legislation admit
i that the bill's chances are hopeless in
this Congress. Besides all the power
ful Congressional influences against
the measure, the attitude of the chief
executive toward proposed legislation
of this character is such as to warrant
a positive statement that the bill now
in Congress cannot -become a law.
Representatives McKinlay and Hayes,
who are especially active in the sup
port of Japanese exclusion, realize that
the members of the House need much
enlightenment on the question and
they will take every opportunity to
carry on the campaign of education in
the matter. They and others of the
Californian delegation will be heard on
the subject In speeches before 'the
House., They hope to create ..a .senti
ment that will give the advocales" of
exclusion better chances for success "in
Judicial Congresses.

TRAVERSING OF NORTHWEST

Men With Arctic Experience Say
Amundsen ' Has Added Nothing
to World's Knowledge.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 7. â Men In this city
who have had Arctic experiences seem Inclined
to poohâ pooh the achievement of Explorer.
Amundsen. They declare that navigation of
the Northwest passage is * matter only of
patience and time and that it can add nothing
to the world's knowledge.
Rear Admiral Schley, retired.. 6ald to-night
that he could not see that anything was to be
gained by making the Northwest passage. Said
he:' "Ever elnce the time of Elizabeth men
have been trying to find an easy passage and
one that would discount Columbus'- achieve
ment. FTobisher trltd. and since his time
other men have tried and succeeded, and now
it is only a matter of getting into the ice and
being carried along with it. There is nothing
to discover.
"The magnetic pole was discovered by Ross
100 years ago, but that discovery was without
value, for the variation of the magnet shows
that the pole must likewise vary, and its lo
cation to-day may not be the same as a year
from now."
Brigadier General Greeley. chief of the Signal
Corps of the army, who was the leader of a
famous expedition to the North Pole, said:
"If he stays cvltn his ship a man undoubtedly
can drift through the Northwest passage, but
I cannot see how he can gain any knowledge
which we do not already possess."

HOUSE VOTES
CANAL FUNDS
Passes the Emergency Bill
'After E educing the Ap
propriation by $5,500,000
BOND FEATURE DEBATED
Williams of Mississippi Of
fers Several Amendments,
All of Which Are Defeated
WASHINGTON. Dec. 7.â An appro
! priation of $11,000,000 was voted to-day
I toward the construction of the Panama
| canal. The amount was a compromise
I between the $16,500,000 carried in ; the
I bill under consideration and an estimate
of about $6,000,000, recommended by
Williams, the Democratic leader, to
carry on the work until the middle . of
(January. Hepburn, in charge of- tho
j bill, suggested that $11,000,000 would
j carry on the work until March. There
was no intention manifested to. delay
the work, the only argument for cutting
down the original estimate being that
closer scrutiny might be had of the es
timate.
* The bill was amended In accordance
with suggestions of Mann of Illinois,
directing the President to require an
j nual reports from canal officers, cover
j ing all details of the work; requiring
1 such employes to give Congress any in
formation it may desire, and restrict
ing all expenditures to money appro
priated by Congress and to that received
by the operation of the property of the
Panama railroad. ' .
Otherwise the bill was not amended
and it contains, besides the appropria
tion, a provision removing a tax dis
ability against the proposed bonds to be*
Issued for the construction of the canal,
thus placing" the bonds on a footing
with other Government, bonds, aa avail
able for security for national bank cir
culation and to reimburse the treasury
for the money appropriated in the bill.'
. The bond provision in the bill was a
point of attack to-day. Williams of
Mississippi offered several unsuccessful
amendments, all seeking to abandon
the policy of issuing bonds for the. canal
work, on the ground that there are suf
ficient available funds in the treasury
to meet all needed . demands for the
canal work.

BANK REPORTS
TO BE PROBED
Senate Adopts Resolution
for Investigation of Con
tributions -\u25a0/ to Campaigns
SPEECH BY TILLMAN
Insurance Officials Given
a Grilling by the Mem
ber From* ; : South Carolina
WASHINGTON, Dec. .7.â The subject of
campaign contributions by insurance com-
I panics occupied the major portion of the
* time of the Senate to-day. It came up in
I connection with Tillman's resolution call
ing for an investigation of national banks'
j aid in politics,' and .was exploited, by
, the South Carolina Senator in a speech of
, some length. ; The address dealt with the
I President's recommendations for the pun
.[ ishment of bribery in elections, with Sen
i ator Platfs testimony the New
York investigating committee .and with
various other pertinent matters. It* was
couched in characteristic language and
attracted much attention. The resolution
directing the Secretary of the Treasury
to report whether the reports of the Na
tional Bank Examiners showed that the
banks had made campaign \u25a0 contributions
in recent years was adopted at the close
of Tillman's remarks.
. Tillman: quoted with especial emphasis
the President's remarks concerning cam
paign contributions by corporations.
"Our chief executive has taken a very
progressive stand to secure purity in
elections," ' he said, and added: "Every
good American will say, 'Well done.' and
lobk for progress along that line."
Continuing Tillman said:
I am ; the holder of a " small policy in the
New York Mutual and I don't like to have my
dividends cut down in order to give Mr. Mc-
Curdy 1150.000 and his sisters, his cousins and
his aunts $75,000 each. "\u25a0\u25a0 ,
Bailey asked whether the insurance
company contributions to the Republican
National Committee had been returned to
the donors.
; Tillmanâ l understood that the President was,
going to have Mr. Cortelyou return- them, but
I don't know whether he has done so. I know
that I have not got my share.
Spooner â Is yours a life policy?
Tillmanâ lt Is.
Spooner â Then It is not yet time to realize
on it.
Tillman replied that it was dividends,
and not the policy Itself, he wanted paid.
Said he:
These are pitifully small, while Mr. McCurdy
has been getting fat without doing anything.
Bailey said he had not supposed that
the President would make a second
recommendation on the subject of punish
ing campaign contributions until the
money had been returned. Tillman re
sponded: ':
\u25a0 Ah. Mr. President, all the Turveydrops and
Pecksniffs are not dead yet. although I would
not for a moment be understood as comparing
our occupant of the White House with those
characters. /What we want Is results, and
those he does not seem to have procured so far.
Quoting the testimony of Senator Platt
before the New York committee, Tillman,
congratulated Platt upon his " straightfar
wardness.-Said he: ;.'Â»-" ? - '"''â¢\u25a0
There was no dodging, T and I do not believe
that a dollar of the money- ever stuck to hi*
fingers. . s , .
He added his conviction, . however,
that the contributions had had the ef
fect of controlling New York in the
interest of the insurance companies, j
Tillman quoted the charges made by
Judge Parker in the last ' campaign
connecting thÂ© Republican \ campaign
contributions with the fact that Chair
man Cortelyou had * recently retired
from the office of Secretary of the De
partment of Commerce and Labor. He
also quoted the". President's reply,
which, he said., was "red hot." and
added that not a dollar had been used
to elect the President. Notwithstand
ing this fact, he said, it had been
shown that $1,900,000 had been con
tributed for- that purpose.
Tillman also *. made reference .to the
charge that large expenditures had
been made by the Democrats in the
Cleveland campaign, saying it would
have been fortunate for the Demo
cratic party If Cleveland had never
been elected. He closed with an ap
peal for a thorough investigation,:, say
ing such a course was necessary to,re
store the confidence: of the public. :

MASQUERADING MAID
COMES TO GRIEF.
Dons Military Garb, but Permits Her Vanity
to Mar Perfection of the Disguise.
ROUGE AND PIGMENTS BETRAY HER
JAMES C. CRAWFORD
When she decided to go masquerading
as a private infantryman Miss Maggie
M. Collins, youthful and comely, permit
ted her feminine vanity to mar her aim
at realism, for she rouged her cheeks and
applied black pigment to -her brows and
eyelashes, the result being a complexion
that was striking, but not such as com
mon soldiers usually present. Her abund
ant hair she managed splendidly, for It
was tucked within her cap so as to con
vey no hint of her sex to any person who
inspected her front elevation. Behind, how
ever, it was less deceptive, for no male
person trains his hair to grow upward.
The remainder of the disguise was per
fect, her Juno-like form filling most
gracefully the jacket and nether gar
ments, especially the latter.
When the natty figure approached Pa
trolman Nelson as that indefatigable
peace guardian was strolling along lower
Pacific street he bestowed upon it merely
a casual glance, and it would, have been
allowed to pass without Interference if it
had not exclaimed In shrill tone, "Hello,
Cap." The rouge and the pigment com
pleted the betrayal.
The young woman was garbed in mod
est black when Police Judge Conlan pro
nounced her guilty of vagrancy and re
manded her for sentence. She declined to
give reason for costuming herself and
publicly strutting a la militaire.
Emma Sweeney, who aimed five pistol
bullets at Antonio Pedranini, a Pacific
street ealoon-kceper, and failed to hit him
once, was sent to the Superior Court by
Judge Fritz, with bail fixed at $2000. She
refused to disclose the cause of her pistol
play.
Miss Mary. Gloecher, hairdresser, living
at 725 O'Farrell street, was accused ot
having stolen a skirt from the store of
Weinstock & Lubin, and Judge Cabaniss
continued the hearing until to-day. Sev
eral other stolen garments were found
in the woman's apartments.
Police Judge Mogan applied olfactory
test to several of the eggs which Fred
Bergman and Fred Griffin, peddlers, were
offering for sale at 50 per cent of the pre
vailing market quotation when Patrolman
J. Young arrested them for hawking food
which he suspected to be unfit for human
consumption. His Honor's ticklish experi
ment was watched with breathless inter
est, not to say trepidation, by a crowded
courtroom, and many thumbs and fore
fingers held a la pincers ascended toward
twitching nostrils as he gingerly picked
up, sniffed at and laid down each sample
drawn at random from a box containing
thirty dozens. Fortunatery the nerve
racking ordeal was concluded without ac
cidental breakage. ( ,
While the Judge was endeavoring to
determine the quality of the eggs he was
given much luminous Information by El
mer. F. Larimer of the commission firm
of Monotti, Larimer & Co., Clay and Da
vis- streets, from whom \u25a0 the defendants
purchased the thirty dozens for. $4. Mr.
Larimer stated that eggs are divided Into
four classes.
"The eggs under inspection by the
court," he said, "are of the second class,
or more than one week and less than
three weeks old. They are good, whole
some eggs, but, of course, less desirable
than the number ones, which do not ex
ceed a week in age. The number threes,
which have passed their third week of
existence, are palatable, and cheap res
taurants serve them."
"And the number fours?" his Honor
asked, with such eagerness as to imperil
the egs in his hand and to cause the
spectators to gasp with apprehension lest
It drop. _-
"The number fours," Mr. Larimer re
plied, "are chopped up for chicken feed
,and are used by tanners andâ"
"Are hurled at bad actors, I presume,"
the court Interrupted, probably thinking
of the morning paper story of how the
divine Bernhardt was pelted with ancient
eggs by an ungallant populace the pre
vious day in Quebec
"Yes, sometimes," Mr. Larimer said,
pleasantly.
"I know something about eggs myself,"
said Officer Young, "and nobody can" con
vince me that those eggs in that box are
fit for human food."
"Some of them certainly, have an odor
of antiquity," the Judge remarked, gazing
reproachfully at the' egg in hand. " *
"All cracked eggs smell musty," Mr.
Larimer averred.
"But this egg isn't cracked," said the-
Judge.
"Well, I guess it has been.lying in prox
imity to an egg that Is cracked," was the

that his guess was correct. '
"Let's take 'enÂ» down cellar and candle
'em," suggested Officer. Young.
When it was explained to the Judge
that the "candlingV process consisted of
holding an egg between the eyr and a
light in a dark place and thus ascertain
ing whether the egg was qualified to en
ter fastidious society he rejected the sug
gestion.
"I'll remand these eggs for analytical

Benjamin Holladay, a young man from
Portland, was arrested for violating a
park ordinance by speeding an automo
bile at a thirty-mlles-an-hour clip on the
Ocean boulevard, and ? he pleaded guilty
before Judge Cabaniss.
"But, your Honor," he said, "it was my
first offense of the kind arid it was not
committed willfully, as 'l was Ignorant of
the law regulating the speed of automo
biles in this. city. Under the conditions
I ask for dismissal." .
"Are you related to the late Benjamin
Holladay, founder of the pioneer pony ex
press and stage coach and steamship
lines?" his Honor inquired.
"He was my father," the young fellow
replied.
"Ah." said his Honor, "then I perceive
the law of atavism and heredity at work
In this case.< Your father began an active
and successful career' on horsebackâfig
uratively speakingâ then transferred him
self from the back of a horse to the top
of a stage coach, thence to the hurricane
deck of an ocean steamer." '
"Yes," good-humoredly acquiesced the
defendant, "and then to a locomotive."
"Exactly," said the court; "he . after
ward became interested in railway pro
jects." Nothing:, could be more natural,
therefore, than that you, his son, should
utilize the most up-to-date means of lo
comotion. When you assumed control of
that automobile doubtless your "ancestral
blood urged you to open wide the throt
tle and let her go chug-chug?" ,
The defendant smiled, j
"And when flying' machines come into
vogue," his Honor pursued, *'I suppose
you will Instinctively, sweep' through the
air at breakneck speed?"
The defendant's smile widened.
"Well," resumed the court, "in view
of your defensive *plea and, your in
herent propensity to annihilate dis
tance, I presume the demands of jus
tice will be satisfied with a forfeiture
of your ten dollars cash bail."
Young Mr. Holladay bowed and re
tired. - .
Although the debate was waged In
German, It was perfectly intelligible
to Patrolman Teutenberg, and when- he
commanded the disputants to move on
and cease obstructing pedestrian, traf
fic at Bush and Kearny streets he 'was
partly impelled thereto by. the quality
of the adjectives they employed.

John Roth, who towered at least a

NEWS OF THE COUNTIES ABOUT THE BAY
BODY ON JAGGED ROCKS
GIVES HINT OF CRIME
Two boys yesterday found the, body of a well-dressed ypung man lying on the
rocks, within touch of the water, by the broad-gauge mole. A bullet hole in the head
showed how death had come. As there was.no money. or- mark of - s - identification on the
person the case presents a question as*to whether it was murder or suicide.

Death of Young
Man Is Deep.
Mystery. \
OAKLAND. Dec. 7.â With a bullet In
bis brain and no mark of identification on
his person the body of a young man was
found on the rocks of the broad gauge
mole this afternoon. '.?.-\u25a0?.
Dr. O. D. Hamlin. assisted by Drs.
Curdts and Relnle. held an autopsy this
evening:, and it is the opinion of the three
eurgeons that the man was murdered.
The police are now working on the mys
tery, endeavoring to ascertain whether
the man was the victim of thugs or took
his own life. They are Inclined to the be
lief that it is a case of suicide, but they
cite at a loss to explain several peculiar
circumstances connected with the mys
tery.
Among these circumstances were the
Xact that, although the man was well
dressed, not a cent nor an article of any
character was found in his clothing. That
led to the story of robbery# and the fact
that there were no powder marks on the
forehead, where the bullet entered,
strengthened that theory. On the other
hand, the autopsy showed that the man
had been a sufferer from acute pleurisy,
and the police say he might have taken
his own life through despondency.
HOTS MAKE DISCOVERY.
It was shortly after S o'clock this after
noon that M. B. Maurice of 1711 Fifth
etreet and A. P. Pivar of 1715 Fifth street,
boys who were going to fish from the
mole, came upon the body on the rocks.
tt was lying face downward and had
been submerged. When found the iegs
from the thighs downward were beneath
the water. The point where the body was
found was Rbout 1000 feet west of Bay
street.
The boys hastened back to a bath house
at the foot of Seventh street and notified
the Morgue official of their ghastly dis
covery. Deputy Coroner Van Vranken
hastened to the scene and removed the
body to the Morgue and the entire detec- \u25a0
tlve force of the city was detailed on the
mystery.
It was ascertained by Detectives Kyte
and Lynch that there was no hat near
the body and no weapon could be found,
but the tide had come in when the detec
tives reached the scene, and the search
for h-i and pistol was therefore post
poned until the tide is low to-morrow
morning.
The boys who found the body say there
was blood on the adjoining rocks, which
deepens the mystery, in that it is thought
that the waves that submerged the body
must have washed away any bloodstains.
Dr. Hamlin is of the opinion that the
body must have been in the water at
least forty-eight hours, owing to the de
composed condition of the scalp, nose and
.VICTIM A YOL'.XG MAX.
The victim was a man between 25 and
30 years of a.tc. smooth shaven, with a
Celtic cast of countenance. He had prom
inent jaws, a pointed chin and steel gray
eyes. A characteristic feature was his
note, which was very small. It was thin
and pointed. The clothing* was of un
usually cood texture. It consisted of a
blue ft ige back coat and vest and trous
ers, black low cut shoes that had former
ly been tan, fancy blue and white striped
half hose, brcmn underwear, white shirt
with nigh turned-down collar, and a- blue
and while striped necktie. There was. no
xnaik on the shirt or underwear. The col

There was a laundry mark, which under
the microscope appeared to read T. 643 H.

The man was about 5 feet S inches .in
height and weighed 135 pounds. The
Hands and â¢ feet were small, the hands
Indicating that he had never done hard
work.
When the detectives went to work on
the case they at first thought the .victim
was a follower of the race track, and
Detective Kyte took several race horse
men . to the ' morgue In an effort to iden
tify, him. No one was found who could
identify the remains.
MUI*L.KT IS FOtJAI*.
This evening Dr. O. D. Hamlin, assisted
by Drs. Relnle and Curdts, held an au
topsy and found the bullet- that had ended '
the man's life. It was in the right pos
terior lobe of the brain. The bullet was
of C-caliber. It had entered the center
of the forehead at the median line and
taking a slightly" upward course had
struck the rear of the skull about one
half inch to the right. The skull was
fractured and the bullet dropped Into the
brain.
Dr. Hamlin found slight evidence of
contusion above the left ear that was
of ante-mortem origin. The condition of
the lungs proved that death had not been
caused by drowning. The other vital
organs were normal, but it was evident:
that the man had been a sufferer from
acute pleurisy. , ;
g "It is my best judgment that the wound
was not self-inflicted.", said Dr.- Hamlin
after the autopsy.
"While it is true that the course of the
bullet - and â¢: its ..location, showed that
It "might have been sent into .; the
brain by., his :own "hand,, .the absence
of powder .marks .has not been ex
plained. 'It would be impossible -for
Any one to hold a pistol far enough from
his forehead to ; prevent powder marks,
"and there' was not*, assign of powder
marks near the wound or even the.mem
brane of the brain. Neither were there
powder marks on the hands. Even had
he. used smokeless powder there must
have " been ' some sighs of "it either on the
outside or Inside of the wound. If he had
pressed the muzzle of the gun close to his
forehead, according to the theory, of the
detectives, there would .still; have been
signs of the powder. The only, thing. that
would suggest . suicide to me, from the
few details I have of the case. Is that the
man was suffering from pleurisy of an
acute type." '.'.'.'\u25a0' .1

MR. GRUBB'S RASH ACT
Desperate Husband Employs
.^Extraordinary ;Means to
if Meet*His : Bride at' Home
BERKELEY, Dec. 7.â False whiskers
and : a. lot of skeleton keys were utilized
by George Grubb ' last night in an en
deavor to gain an entrance into., the home
of his wife's father, 2926 Otis street, where
Mrs. Grubb has been kept from, him, as
he declares, for severaliweeks. The auda
cious plan of the young husband to secure
an Â» audience with his Imprisoned bride
might have succeeded if he had not en
countered Miss Lottie Johnson, sister of
the: wife, who accused "him of being.* a
burglar and summoned the^ police.
Grubb was taken Into custody and ar
raigned! before Justice Edgar this morn
ing. His tale of a; frantic. husband's at
tempt to see his young bride I impressed
Justice Edgar with 'his sincerity, and as
Mrs. Grubb came into Justice Edgar's of
fice r and pleaded for; the accused' man,
promising to \be reconciled to the young
fellow,' the Judge-dismissed them with
his blessing and ignored the irate family
of the bride, all of whom* objected stren
uously to the proceeding. '
Grubb was- married a few; months ago
to Miss Nellie Johnson, whose father,
Frank Johnson, "is proprietor of the Per
altaÂ° planing mill in South Berkeley. The
couple quarreled recently , and the bride
returned to her father's home. Mr. John
son was. indignant that the girl should
have any cause for complaint of Grubb,
and the young woman remained hidden '
from her husbana. Â»: -i

Prominent Society Woman

v There Is Lack of Discipline
SPEAKS ON TRUANCY
Club Leader Declares Boys
Are Not Controlled in Their
Lapses From the Classroom
\u25a0'. OAKLAND. Dec. 7.â Mrs. Warren a
I Palmer, wife of the general manager
lof j the Southern Paclrtc. Company, a
leader in women's . clubs in this city
and for many years one of the,promi
nent : educators of the . Oakland" school
department, gave the methods of train
in grand discipline in the Oakland High
School a severe scoring in a paper sne
read before , the Oakland Club Wed
nesday. \u25a0 .< .
. "Discipline" was the subject of Mrs.
Palmer's address.,. She gave a lucid
treatment of the relations which should
I exist among parents, teachers and
pupils. .. The paper provoked a discus
sion among: the club members/during
which Mrs. , Palmer ' declared that there
was a lack of responsibility pervading
the h|gh school atmosphere in relation
to the, discipline of pupils. She assert
ed .' that the boys /could too often be
found at bowling alleys,. skating rinks
and; other places of amusement rather
than . in. the schoolroom, where they
were supposed to! be". busy. Tho speak
er urged there should be a reform in
methods :which would render it im
possible 1 for pupils to. remain away
from school without the knowledge of
their parents.
Mrs. Palmer Insisted that the school
curriculums, both high and grammar,
were overburdened with useless studies
and that the rudiments were being sac
rificed for educational "fads." There
was, fair admission that teacherswere
compelled to, handle many, more pupils
than they could "properly deal with in
the schoolroom.
The "discussion : led to a general ex
pression of views by club members
along the line taken by Mrs. Palmer. .
James H. Pond, principal of the high
school, met the criticisms by saying
he ; feared Mrs. Palmer was somewhat
prejudiced ..because her own â¢ son had
not progressed satisfactorily at the
school, and had been withdrawn to at
tend a private school.:
-In further reply, Principal. Pond said:
â¢ Of the 000 pupils enrolled 850 give no trouble
The other fifty need attention and we try to
give It. If the system we pursue in truancy
cases falls It. Is either because of lack of
parents' : co-operation or a fault of the system.
It Is the best -I can devise and If there be a
better one' l. shall welcome its submission to
me. ; . iWe - never fail to -notify \u25a0 parents of a
pupil's absence when we have- any doubt that
tt Is not due, to a legitimate cause.. ; . .
\u25a0In many cases Darents \u25a0 fall ; to make any
reply.to our Inquiries. â¢Youcgr people naturally
tin* -pi: school work and strk relaxation, -but
If we". have parents', co-operation there is little
difficulty. We assume, that .when a pupil
enters the ' hlfth : tchool he ' has reached an age
when he lb old enough to behave himself and
to try, to^meet- the; reaulrements.-- ' ;

this afternoon looking for the students

of last Tuesday evening 1 ,' when the trav

present "'Uncle Tom's Cabin" in Mul

given a rough reception by several hun
dred Stanford students. The officers
were unable to serve* their warrants.
The students 'wanted kept discreetly in
the background. There are thirty
warrants outâ ten for disturbing the
peace and twenty for resisting officers.
The students went to the hall prepared
to * make life miserable for the actora
and actresses by bantering them and
singing college songs. The deputies,
who had been notified that the students
intended to carry things with a high
hand, foiled their plans by voicing an
objection^ One particularly noisy stu
dent overrule-! the objection, and a
real "rough house" resulted. The noisy
one did not like the idea of being
thrown out. r.nd resisted a deputy. A
club was used, and for a few mlnatea
the deputies were kept busy. The depu
ties had the first use of the clubs, and
then the students, by reason of their
superior numbers, secured them. That
the deputies were better skilled in the
use of the weapon is evidenced by thu
fact that more students were, injured
than deputies, though the latter were
outnumbered fifteen to one.
Professor R. L. Green of. the faculty
students' affairs committee states
that nothing: has been done by the fac

and that until the town authorities ap

the matter to run its course."

SAN RAFAEL, Dec. 7.â With a smile
on his face. Walter Warner, the twen
ty-year-old boy guilty of the murder
of Mar|e Tomaya, went into the con
demned cell yesterday morning. He
will remain there until a. few minutes
before his execution at 10:30 to~
} morrow.
Warner, who claimed to be .a deputy
constable at Los Nietos, had been
living with Marie Tomaya, who wad
:an inmate of a house of ill-repute in
Santa Barbura. She contributed to
ward his support, and because she re
fused to increase the amount, he
brutally killed her on June 10. 1904. ..He
was found guilty and sentenced, to hang
on November 21, 1905. He was granted
a reprieve pending an appeal to., tbe
Supreme Court. The appeal was denied
and he was resentenced to be executed
December 8, 1905.. ' .
Warner was one of the most happy
go-lucky prisoners that ever, left Santa
Barbara. As he was bidding his
friends good-by at the depot, he said
to an old -friend who was backward
about shaking hands with him;.
"Come along, fxiend, this is the last
time you will have a chance to shake
my hand."

One of His Judges
Held on the

Ordered to Report to

Changes in Officers Regarded
as Significant by-
Naval Men.
SsÂ»*ciaJ Dispatch, to The Call.
VALLEJO, Dec. 7.â The belief that
the findings of the board of naval offi
cers which tried Commander Lucien
Toung on a charge of neglect of duty,
which charge grew out of the explosion
and loss of life on the Bennington, are
not acceptable to the Navy Department,
Is entertained here as the result of an
order detaching Commander William
Winter from the command of the trans
port Lawton. Commander Winter, -who
was a member of the Young court
martial, is ordered to report to the
president of the board of oScers which
tried Young-. The vessel will be taken
oat by Commander Pond.
The Lawton is scheduled to sail next
week. The change in commanders at
this late date is considered significant.
OrScers high in authority on Marc Isl
and figure that, because of the retention
of Commander Winter on this coast and
the ordering of Winter to report to the
president of the board, the result of the
Young court-martial is not agreeable
to the department.
"It must have been simply a repri
mand," said one well-known officer to
night, "otherwise Winter never would
have been relieved of the command of
the Lawton. This looks as If the Young
<;r.se wi'l be tried over again."

COMMANDER
OF SIBERIA DIES
AT HONGKONG
MASTER OF THS STEAMSHIP SI
BERIA. WHO PASSED AWAY AT
HOXGKON'G TESTERDAT.
Captain J. Tremaine Smith, com-
I mander of the Pacific Mail liner Si
i beria, died yesterday at Hongkong.
i The news was received by General
! Agent Alexander Center yesterday af
ternoon. The cablegram - contained
nothing beyond the announcement of
the skipper's passing away. The Si
beria will be brought home by Chief
Officer Arthur O'Neill.
Captain Smith was In the service of
the Pacific Mail Company for more than
twenty years, and stood high in the
regard of his superiors. His first
command was the City of Sydney. He
was placed in charge of the City of
Peking In ISÂ»S and retained command
of her until he was sent East to super-
Intend the construction of the Siberia.
He brought the Siberia around to this
coast, and to Smith's personal effort
much of the success of that liner Is
due. ... . - . .
Before entering the Pacific Mail ser
vice Captain Smith was instructor of
navigation on the British training ship
Conway, stationed at Liverpool, and
prior to this had commanded a number
of crack sailing vessels. He entered
the Pacific Mail service as a captain.
J. Tremaine Smith -was counted one
of the most capable masters navigating
the Pacific. He -was a thorough sailor
and a mas of fine character. Exacting
of his subordinates, he was a loyal
friend to those under him who did
their duty, and never hesitated to go
to. the front for. a member of his crew
overtaken by trouble. His officers were
devoted to him and few men possessed
in such high degree the gift of com
pelling willing service.
Smith suffered more or less acutely
from rheumatism for the last five years,
and Just before he left this port for
the last time he announced his inten
tion of taking an extended vacation
early in the coming 1 year.
Arthur O'Neill, to whom falls ~the
duty of bringing the liner home, is
well equipped for the task. Between
O'Neill and Smith was a strong bond
of friendship, and it will be with, a
heavy heart that O'Neill steps into the'
place of his beloved skipper.
Captain. Adrian Zeeder probably will
be assigned to the command. of the
Siberia when she reaches this port.

Langdon Says That Parental
School Is Factor in De
creasing Juvenile Crime
BOABD BUYS SCHOOL SITE
Accepts Offer to Sell Lot
for a New Building in
Visitacion Valley District
Superintendent of Schools Langdon filed
yesterday with the Board of Education a
report of the Parental School in charge
of Principal R. D. Faulkner since' its or
ganization, showing: that out of 224 boys
committed to the school 118 were trans
ferred on parole to other schools, to work,
or removed from San Francisco. The tor
tal enrollment Is now 116, none of whom
are above the fifth grade. The total num
ber of investigations for trtiancy durlns
four months was 1674. Langdon says the
Parental School is an important factor in
increasing school attendance and In de
creasing juvenile crime. The " report,
which was adopted by the board, follows:
The cloee proximity of me Parental School
to the only public playground In San Fran
cisco has contributed much to the success of
the school. The boys spend their noon hour
there and drill there twice a weÂ«k under the
physical director of . the grounds, who also
Instructs them in physical culture. Manual
training- is the only salvation for the type of
boy that Is sent to the Parental School. It
should, therefore, be accentuated In this
school. One-half of the boys should do tool
work under the direction of the teacher of
manual training In the center located here.
The other halt should be given manual training
in their classrooms by one of the regular
teachers. Since no teacher now In the school
Is capable of giving such Instruction, I recom
mend that one of the present teachers be trans
ferred and some one put in her place who i 3
capable of giving such instruction.

TRAINING CRIMINALS.
'TpHE exposition of methods of committing theft by burglary, of
j houses, highway robbery and pocket picking that is made at
\u25a0*â¢ * cheap theaters in this and other cities is an education in crime.
These representations are in the form of plays on the stage. The
play is merely a pretense for showing criminal craft and cunning.
The characters are usually juvenile. The price of admission being
only ten cents, the lesson in crime is pat within reach of the young,
and the preponderance of youth in the audiences proves that they
take advantage of their opportunity. Such plays : are taking the
place of the yellow-covered novels, sold for a dime, which were
formerly the means of undermining the morals of the juvenile com-
The young are easily led astray. A newspaper in San Fran
cisco a few years ago published a sensational article showing how
robbers pick locks and break open safes. It was illustrated, show
ing the instruments used and describing their construction and the
method of. their use. In due time there occurred in a neighboring
city a number of expert burglaries, in which much property was
captured. The police believed that it was tic. work of hardened and
experienced Eastern crooks, and were surprised when an accidental
capture proved it to be the work of two boys under fourteen years
of age. When questioned they confessed that they got the sugges
tion of their crimes from the newspaper article and had followed its
instruction successfully. There had been nothing in their family
history nor in their surroundings to indicate a criminal cast of mind
or tendency. They had simply received a criminal suggestion,, and
had acted upon it, without compunction or thought of the conse-
Newspapers must of necessity print the record of crime as part
of the day's news. They must publish the noble and the ignoble, but
they must avoid as far as' possible the instructive details of crime,
and. above all, must not give to it the gloss of romance and adven
ture, lest it appeal as a suggestion to those Avhose judgment and
morals are unformed, and who are therefore subject to wrong im
pressions.
A staff writer of The Call has written of the so-called theatri
cal representation of crime in cheap theaters in this city. The story
is appalling. Every such representation is a public peril. It is a
center from which crime radiates in all directions. Of course main
parents can say that their children do not attend such shows. But
they come in contact with those who do. One boy, depraved by such
criminal instruction, may infect a dozen others who never saw that
which suggested crime to him.
Such things are like the local centers of contagious disease,
whence it spreads to destroy those who never saw its breeding place.
The legitimate stage is disgraced by such offensive companionship.
The unthinking who go headlong into reform of all kinds associate
such misuse and degradation of the theater with the stage in gen
eral, and extend their denunciation of plays to all histrionic repre-
The legitimate stage has the right to protest against the per
mission given to these cheap places to debauch the juvenile mind
and morals, under the pretense of presenting plays. The stage has
a right to call upon the police to suppress a school for crime that
masquerades in its name. It is a far cry from the art of Mans
field to the criminal school of a ten-cent theater. There is no re
lation between them. The one presents the great issues of life from
the standpoint of morals and philosophy. The other grovels in glori
fication of the ignoble and the low. The young are imitative. When
they see on the cheap stage boys, like themselves, successfully plan
ning and executing a robbery, dividing and enjoying the proceeds
without detection or punishment, their, imitative faculty is appealed
to. Country boys who go to the circus imitate what they see in the
ring by riding the old mare, standing, and barefoot on her bare
back. The city boy exercises his imitative faculty by essaying the
crimes and transgressions that are portrayed on the ten-cent stage.
Prevention lies with public authority. It should be rigidly ap
plied. Public opinion should compel action. All of these incite
ments and suggestions of crime and transgression should be exter
minated. We do not assume that San Francisco is any worse in this
respect than other large cities, but we do insist that it shall be
made better than others. The news record of each day in our papers
reveals the appalling number of crimes committed by boys in their
early teens. Skillful highway robberies, burglaries and in many
instances, murders, are committed by smooth-faced boys. As there
is a cause for everything in the physical world, so there is a cause
for everything in the moral world. When the cause is found it
should be exterminated. The causes of juvenile crime are not se
cret. They are known, and it is time to see that they shall cease.
THE FRUIT GROWERS.
'"T**HE meeting of the thirty-first annual convention of . California
I fruit growers is appropriately held at Santa Rosa, the home
* Â©f Luther Burbank/the greatest horticulturist in the world. In
the preliminary addresses preceding the discussion of horticultural
specialties, the statement was made that the present value of the
fruits and fruit products of California is $50,000,000 annually. That
is an enormous interest and one that the State may well foster by
every means within its power. In two directions every energy
should be exercised in behalf of the fruit interest of this State. One
is in the prevention and cure of pests and diseases that attack, tree
and vine. We are too inattentive to the losses caused by these ene
mies .of plant life. We need more experts in vegetable physiology
and pathology, and more study of the subject.
Professor .Cobb, an American who was employed by the Aus
tralian governments to recreate their wheat culture and other crops
fallen into decay by the attack of parasites, disease and soil poverty,
is one of the foremost vegetable pathologists in the world. In a
recent address to the sugar planters of Hawaii on the diseases and
parasites of the sugar cane, Professor Cobb said that fungus pests
nearly annihilated the coffee crop of Ceylon, causing a yearly loss
of $5,000,000 for sixteen years. In Australia fungus diseases . of
wheat made a loss in 1891 of $12,000,000. The losses on all crops
in the United States due to insects and fungus total $200,000,000 a
year. The loss to California by vine disease is estimated at $10,
000,000.
These statements show how important it is to pay attention to
predatory insects and parasitic "diseases, and the loud call there is
for vegetable pathologists and entomologists.
The other direction to which attention must be drawn is the
marketing of our fruit products in respect to rates of transportation
and distribution to the consumer. When our combined fruit grow
ers can have access to facilities for refrigerating the cars they hire,
a great cause of complaint will disappear. It i.is gratifying to read
in the address of Mr. Ellwood Cooper, president of th\ society, that
notwithstanding all drawbacks the present has been a banner year
for the California fruit growers, and that they have prospered ex
ceedingly. â¢

THE SOUL OF THE THING.
A BLIND and shapeless Thing was
spawned In the gloom of abysms
deep.
Where Might and Oppression their red I
seed sow, the seed that they surely
reap;
And it lay on the lap of its Mother Earth,
, aborted as foul things be,
Sprawling its/ twisted and shapeless limbs
from the Black to the Arctic Sea;
While one hand reached to its Asian nurse
and dug at her tawny, breastâ
Ah, never was yet so hapless a thing as
this child of the East and West.
And, "Ho," cried the -.' Tyrant, "this
blinded Thing . .; ':>. -
I will shackle and make my own;
I will teach It to carry and eke to bring.
And do but my will alone." ,
So the Tyrant_ labeled himself a king.
That he better might shackle the shape
less Thing.
Then the hand of oppression went grimly
out to throttle the Thing thus
spawned,
Ere ever the whisper of God was heard,
or the day of its freedom dawned;.
And courtiers heeded the great Czar's
, nod,' the chains of his power to bind.
And the shapeless Thing knew not its
might, for lo! it was bound and blind;
And still was the brutal drama played
through centuries shorn of 'right.
And the Thing knew not, nor it under
stood, us it sprawled in the halls of
.night. , .
And, "Ho,", cried the -Tyrant, "'tis
more than fine
That vassals must do my will.
And this shapeless Thing shall ever be
mine,
For the whisper of hope I'll still."
So the scepter 'descended from father to
son.
As a scepter will doâ till its course is rum.
Then the God, of us all, or vassal" or king,
looked down on* the cursed deed,
"It; is "time," ."quoth \ He,' "thatjan end

And He touched its eyes till it dimly saw,
and he wakened Its Eleeplng soul;
And the prone â¢ Thing rose, and it .shook
itself, and its power it dimly guessedâ
Power of grace from the dreaming East,
of strength from. the waking West. %
Yet, "Ho," cried the Tyrant, "a great
white Czar
Is a splendid thing to be;
And my people shall be what my people
are.
Vassal and bond to me." . ,
And little of care did' the '.Tyrant take
That the soul of the Thing was at last

WHAT IS WEALTH?

npHE modern, vice is not too much devotion to. wealth, but too little. So
I . Professor Albion W.' Small, the eminent _ sociologist, contends in one

.Press. â¢'â¢^"â¢Vi-^sH \u25a0'\u25a0.-; lV : -â¢-'.'\u25a0'\u25a0
: . : "Our materialism is too extensive, but not intensive enough. It puts up
with quantitative ' title instead vof , qualitative possession. â¢ â¢ â¢ We have
gained: the Midas touch, but we have forfeited the full franchise of wealth."
Interest in wealth is a normal desire in' man. It marks a distinct stage
in the growth of the human individual. Ability to exercise lordship over
things is one difference 'between the civilized man and the savage.
The latter neither commands, nor marshals, nor' compels to his service
the limitless resources of ores and fibers and forces in whose midst he
stands; raw roots and fleah and pelts, and such tools as monkeys use
almost as capably. as himself, comprise his wealth. It is not until he begins
to exercise his lordship over things., commences to 'use them, order them,
and mold them to his will and imagination,; that. he becomes a man.
When men want wealth for. its own sake, then, our authority argues,
tne impulse appears to-be at the outset an instinct -which is creative in
essence, since primarily it is a desire to control nature and make It subject
to their own' personality. .'When "men wantywealth for reasons intrinsic to
itself, ; they are actuated by 'other desires than the wealth Interest, and the 3*3 *
matter becomes complicated, since there are six *Â«nds in reference to which
man acts' habituallyâ health," wealth, sociability,' knowledge, beauty and
rightness. â¢

Mere possession. of money power, may bestow liberty,' but it cannot give

who handles the symbols of wealth,, and " either neglects or- delegates the

NEWEST FAD IN GEMS.
IN GEMS, as in everything else, there
are fads, and the newest fad in
precious stones Is the tourmaline,
says Leslie's Weekly. Unless you are
a jeweler or for some other reason
have a special knowledge you will
ask probably. "What Is tourmaline V
It Is a semi-precious stone and one
of the most beautiful that come out
of the ground. It Is a rival of the
ruby In color, but wears much better,
approaching the diamond in hardness.
Unlike tha, ruby, however, the tourma-.
line has the greatest variety of tints
of \u25a0 any gem. Its various specimens
have .shades of black, white, green,
yellow, red and pink. Some of the
specimens of the gem are like emer
alds; others have the yellow luster of
the topaz and red tourmalines are
sometimes sold as rubles. The "new"
gem Is used In much the same manner
as, for instance, a ruby. The leading
je welry.s stores of New York are show

malines with smaller borders of dia

MANY VISITORS
Attractive Innovation in S.
X. \Vood & Co/s Store Is
Admired by Big Crowds
NEW FEATUBE POPULAR
Tasteful Entrance to the
Place Is an Example of
Modern Business Ideas
The new arcade leading into S. N.
Wood a- Co.'s big store in the Flood
building at Market and Powell streets
is an example of how up-to-date busi
ness men can help beautify the city.
The busiest of tnose In the crowds that
passed the store yesterday were held
by its attractiveness and were forced
to stop and admire. This new feature
sivos S. N. Wood & Co. a double
claim to having the most attractive
in the city.
The walks and celling are built of
selected oak. carefully grained. The
floor is Qt tastefully laid mosaic work.
The coppered steel framework around
the costly plate glass windows Is sup
ported by beautiful specimens of Ten
nessee marble. r
The arcade Is illuminated by helo
phane globes, suspended by massive
and costly brass chains. These lamps
give a soft glow, restful to the eyes,
and greatly enhance the beauty of the
structure.
In the center of the arcade is a
pretty little dome built of leaded art
glass. Standing under this the visitor
<an *see across the entire lower floor
of the big store, which extends the en
tire length of the Flood building.
The arcade makes access to the big
store easy. Previous to Its opening:
customers were somewhat Inconveni
enced by having to walk around to El
lis and Powell streets to gain entrance.
Xow they can enter through the ar
cade from Market street.
Hints of the bewildering quantity of
garments in the place are contained In
the capacious show \u25a0windows that bor
der the arcade. The structure gives a
display space of 120 feet. Those in
tereeted can look without being Jostled
and jarred by the crowds on the side
walks.
Up on the second floor the firm has
an art reception-room that is one of
the sights of the city. The hospitality
of the firm makes this almost a public
institution. There !s where the tired
shopper goes to "collect her thoughts."'
If she has a letter that must be an
swered or a note that must be written
immediately there is writing material
there and plenty of comfortable desks.
The latest magazines are at hand. In
fact, the place is like a free library,
only much more cozy.
Yesterday, to celebrate the opening
of the arcade, thousands of plctoral
postcards were given away. The cards,
which contained views of San Fran
cisco, were gotten up at considerable
expense and make attractive souvenirs.
The card idea is also one of the in
novations introduced by this up-to
date firm. Mail bags, bulging with
th^m, were carried away from 'the
store yesterday.
In the store are almost enough gar
ments to clothe the entire population
of San Francisco. That is an ambition
which S. N*. Wood & Co. Is endeavor
ing to achieve. The firm's plans are
all laid to this end and the methods
employed are making it more possible
every day.
Anoiher new feature of the store
that is welcomed enthusiastically by
the patrons of S. N. Wood & Co. Is the
introduction of a shoe department.
The firm in its branching out policy
has decided to take up this line of
goods. This makes S. N T . Wood & Co.
complete outfitters in every sense of
the word.

THE "COFFEE HEART."
It la a* Daneerom aa the Tobacco or
Whiaky Heart.
"CoffeÂ« heart" Is common to _sany
coffee users and Is liable to send the
owner to his or her long; home If the
drug Is persisted in. You can run 30 or
40 yards and find out if your heart Is
troubled. A lady who was once a vic-
tim of the "coffee heart" writes from
Oregon:
"I have been a habitual user of coffee
Â£.11 my life and have Buffered .very much
In recent years from ailments which I
became satisfied were directly due to
the poison in the beverage, such as tor-
pid liver and Indigestion, which In turn
made my complexion blotchy and
muddy.
"Then my heart became affected. It
would beat most rapidly Just after I
drank my coffee, and go below normal
as the coffee effect wore off. Sometimes
my pulse would go as high as 137 beats
to the minute. My family were greatly
alarmed at my condition and at last
mother persuaded me to begin the use
of Postum Food Coffee.
"I gave up the old coffee entirely and
absolutely, and made Postum my sole
table beverage. This was 6 months ago,
and all my ills, the indigestion, inactive
liver and rickety heart action, have
passed away, and my complexion has
become clear and natural. The Im-
provement set in very soon after ., I
made the change, just as soon as the
coffee poison had time to work out of
my system.
"My husband has also been greatly
benefited by tbe use of Postum, and we
find that a simple breakfast. with Post-
um is as satisfying and more strength-
ening than the old heavier meal we
used to have with the other kind of
coffee." Name given by Postum Co.,

THE^ SANijFRANGISGOItGALL, FRIDAY;; DECEMBER & 1905.
BERGER SLATED
FOR GOOD JOB
Secretary of Uiiion - Labor
Campaign Committee y Is
Backed for a Clerkship
CANDIDATES ARE -MANY
3laurice A. Owens Announces
Aspirations for a Place
on One of the Commissions
George H. Berger, secretary of the
campaign committee of the Union!
Labor party, is % said: to be slated for at
good job in the distribution of the!
municipal loaves and. fishes on . Jan- j
vary 8, next. Berger is being strongly
backed for the position of clerk of ,the v
Board of Supervisors by the County
Committee of the party named," but it
may happen that the .powers that; be, [
In the persons of Schmitu and Ruef,
will console Berger with some other
place of similar importance, such as a
deputyship in one of the city offlces.
Berger has the clerical and executive I
ability required for the place named.
It Is said that the appointment of "the
clerk of the board may be passed to
the Supervisors themselves, but no I
definite plans on that score have' as
yet been outlined.; The crop of can
didates is a large one and from present
Indications It is any man's fight: Her
bert Schmltz, George ..Keane, George
Benham, Thomas Atkinson and George
Boyne are among those 'mentioned., ' ; "
Maurice A. Owens, of Owens & Starr,
the restaurant firm, ftas announced
himself as a candidate for a Commis
sioner's appointment" under the coming
administration. Owens is said to be
close to the existing political throne,
but the fact that' the Commissioners
whose terms are about to expire are all
likely to be reappointed makes the
possibility of a vacancy romote, unless
one or two of the Incumbents who are
not In especially good odor with the ad
ministration are "Induced" to resign.
There is considerable talk that Park
Superintendent John McLaren has come
into disfavor with the Schmltz admin
istration, owing to - his alleged- activity
In the cause of the' Republican League..
The friends of Fire Commissioner Finn
would like to see him get McLaren's
place, but Finn may elect to remain
where he Is, especially if his plans for
entering Into business come through.
Myrtle Cerf Is likely to secure some
good municipal plum. Cerf has been
active in Schinitz's political behalf, and
the fact that he Is an accountant may
result in his being engaged as an ex
pert to Investigate the city's accounts.
There Is some $8000 available for the
purpose, the work previously having
been done by the Hassell Company,
which seemed to be in great favor with
the present Supervisors' Finance Com
mittee. The company named .was paid
more than $11,000 during the last two
fiscal years for expert work.
In many- Instances applicants for
position are being referred to the As
sembly district committees.
Several changes will be 'made in the
Emergency Hospital staff on January 1.
Dr., George K. Herzog has been asked to
tender his resignation. Dr. William E.
Stevens" leaves the service of his own ac
cord on the first of the year. Lack of po
litical pull Is ascribed as the -cause of
Herzog's dethronement
Ruef and Schmitz have been besieged by
many job-hungry medicos >who lent their
aid to the Union Labor cause at the last
election. In order to place these aspir
ants several of those now In the hospital
service will have to retire. Dr. Herzog,
whose political "drag" originates in Ma
rin County, is the weakest man. He will
be put out first. Dr. Stevens, who will
resign to attend to his practice,' will
leave another vacancy.
Dr. James W. Ward, president of the
Health Board, has been endeavoring to act
as dictator of the emergency service. He
asked a strong Ruef physician for his
resignation a few days' ago, and was
promptly rebuked by Ruef himself for
"butting in." Ward inadvertently picked
the Ruef man for decapitation, and was
i told that he would hereafter be merely
allowed to offer suggestions.
Dr. W. J. Hannah, formerly one of the
Schmitz Health Board "inspecting physi
cians," who served sixteen months on no
pay, has to be placed. Hannah has been
trying for autopsy surgeon under Coro
ner-elect Walsh, but may be compelled
to be satisfied with an Emergency Hos
pital job. .
Although the applicants for the position
of autopsy surgeon are many, those with
a chance have been sifted down to Drs.
C. A. Glover and W. J. Hannah. Glover
seems to have the Inside track to this lu
crative position. k -
It Is also rumored that Dr. George Good
ale Is being embalmed for a place on the
shelf.

LEADING RAISIN
MEN TO CONFER
Packers and^Xxrowers^ Will
Meet Crisis at Fresno
in Open -Mass-Meeting;
IaEEEMENT IS DESIRED
President H. J. Crocker
Hopes' That All Differences
Will Be Reconciled Soon
December 18 bids fair' to be marked
in the history of the raisin' Industry
in California. On . that day a meeting
I of the ereatest : possible i importance to
j raisin- men will be,; held at Fresno.
Raisin growers, raisin : . packers and
others will comÂ© '\u25a0- together in mass
meeting, to see whether differences of
opinion that ! have ; recently arisen may
! not be harmonized. If the i result is
favorable one of .the . strongest und
most veffective combinations that ever
has existed among California' business
men ; will, be made finally effective.
This is the opinion of men In thls.;city
and elsewhere who are 'Identified with
raisin production.' If, on the : other
hand, the issue -Is oneof ydisagree
| ment the outcome: la likely to be very
discouraging to combined, effort, ac
cordirik^ to the same trade. \u25a0 author! tle3..
"Whatever may be ; the result It Is
probable that some ' spirited moments
may characterize the deliberations.
The growers and | the packers some
time ago each appointed live members
of Â« Joint committee. of ten ; members.
Henry J. Crocker of this city was "ser
lected as the president and eleventn
member, with the casting vote in case
of a tie between the two interests con
cerned. ' (
A general acquiescence was expected
in the plan that was devised to . im
prove the j raisin men's condition, but j
a prominent raisin . producer,* who is
also a member of the packers' com
mittee, has refused to come in with his
raisins and various 4 more or less mov
ing happenings have ' already taken
place. >
Henry J. Crocker was asked about
the situation yesterday, < but he de
clined to make any 'statement further
than that he hoped- that some agree
ment would.be reached before the 18th
inst. The Interests involved run ' Into
millions of dollars, v- \u25a0 \;> '

JURY IS TUSSLING
WITH UNGER CASE
Locked Up for Night After
Being Out Several
Hours.
The third trial of Ccass linger for
embezzlement, so far as the. counsel
were concerned, closed with the sub
mission of the case to the" Jury at 3:68
p. m. yesterday In the United ; States
District Court. By 8 o'clock last even
ing the jury had failed to reach an
agreement, and after a request to have
read the statute regarding embezzle
ment had been complied with. It was
ordered locked up for the night.
Mr. Schleslnger concluded his argu
ment early in the morning session and
was followed by Seth Mann, who spoke
until after noon. Mr. Mann made a
strong plea for the sympathy of the
Jury for the defendant and his wife
and children, then in the court room.
United States District Attorney Rob
ert T. Devlin closed for' the prosecu
tion. He- asked for a conviction and
maintained that the Government had
proved Cress Unger to bave been guilty
of embezzlement, and. that his convic
tion and punishment, were necessary as
a warning to wrong doers.

more that it has held this position for' nearly half a

was ''nothing to it but the favorite.

'There: was little* to .recommend the
card- ; but the siz^'- of the fields. Four
favorites .were overturned and the ring
brushed up-some. -~;\
; What 'a cold onethe talent did pick
up-to win the introductory two-year
old'sprint for maidens. Radtke, no
doubt,' 1 was the charm, but even he
could not -\u25a0 make ;Prince Nao extend
'himself. * .Owing to his bad legs the
Eddie; Jones youngster, is strictly a
mudder;* beyond fiuestlon. for he fin
ished 'back, in the \u25a0â¢ ruck. : Knapp landed
the' "Jennings entry ] Pal .first,*; while Sea
Lad'and Frank Flittner fought it out I
for,'-;the '-"place." The winner closed at |
odds of 8 to 1.

Bellona, the entry of "Frisco" Hoag,
practically friendless in the betting,
captured the two-year-old selling af
fair.' ; Loague rode, the daughter of
Beau Ormonde, against which 25 and'
30 ;to 1 could be j had. After leading
from thu start, she downed Legal Form
half <"a. ..length. Ramils was third.

closed favorite. . >
\u0084Â» At- least half a, dozen of the ten
starters for the mile and a sixteenth
selling run. rcould.be figured a chance.
Lucrece, with Radtke on her back, al
ways j enjoyed first call in 7. the betting.
The .mare did not appear at her best,
finishing third. Rey Dare, a 5 to 1
chance, vexcelltntly handled by Teddy
Robinson,, assumed charge before the
stretch/had been reached and scored I
handily from Hi .Caul Cap,' a 10 to 1
shot. :Mountebank resigned early, after
displaying a Hash .of, speed." ;
â¢ Knapp and Lurene," the favorite, were
still : hiding in the park after Crigli
had- beaten Nonie for the seven-furlong
selling fixture. The latter, a 20 to 1
shot., made all the running, but failed
toe' stay, and Crigli earned the 1 decision,
going away. The show, went to Esh

Reasons Why We
;-Mmk : ..;.W ' PATiENTS ARE
.Cured to Stay Cured
FIRST~We 3 have canfidence: in pur -ability tp
r- curet all 'cases coming /j under the head of OUT
:* : specialty, which i^ confined to
\u25a0 disease and disordef^of MEN ;OMI_Y.
SECCWMDnrWe never-accept^a^case^ until we have
M made: a thorough- examination and feel con-
fident we can cure it.- .. ,1 .i-;": â¢
;THIRD---We: d6:riot;believe a physician is en-
; titledjto his - fee- until he ;has proven to the
satisfaction of the patient-that-he can cure him.
FOURTHâ Our fee is so small, being only-$12.)0,
f^.;- I that?%e J believe; any honest man will - pay
; .if after-he ; iscured. ; ; '
fFIFTIi-^There are so^many impostors and un-
X- reliable so-called .specialists 'that we believe
'$ our methods will in .5-tim.e prove our superior-
ity and hence be the more; profitable.
SIXTHâ Giir enormous practice, buiit up on these
lines, proves the fact of all our: statements.
SEVENTHâ rShouId a patient pay usin advance he
-might quit treatment before being perma-
u -riently cured, and our reputation Iwould be
thus jeopardized. -
EIGHTHâ ShouId a few dishonest patients refuse
to pay after they are cured, the loss would
be only $12.50 each, and we could stand it
with more fortitude than if it "were a big fee.
NINTHâ Many honest men without ready money
might otherwise neglect themselves and thus
become incurable, while our Not-a-doliar-
Ufitil-cured motto enables them to take ad-
vantage of our special skill and. pay at their
leisure. . ;
TENTHâLast, but not least, we desire to reach
the poor; as well as the rich man, and by
making pur fee only $i2.5'0, payable on such
easy terms, we thereby increase pur business
and secure lasting gratitude frofo thousands
.who would otherwise remain afflicted if : it
were not for this liberal offer.
AH of the above reasons we are willing to verify and practically
demonstrate to the most skeptical. Our offer is to you, to every one,
only $12.50 for a cure, payable at your convenience, in such sums- a3
you can spare. Could an offer, be more generous? It savors of hon-
esty. It is honest. No matter what your trouble is â if you suffer from
neglect, for want of money or from unskillful practiceâ here is an op-
portunity to get the services of a skilled specialist, a graduate physician,
with years of ripe experience in treating complicated and special 'dis-
orders of men only. It will cost you nothing to talk. to us, and may be
the means of restoring you to health and happiness. Why not call to-
day? Our offices are very private. You see only the doctor. : If _ you-
cannot call, write for blanks, as we extend the same liberal offer to those
who cannot call: In fact, there is no excuse for being disordered .or
sick while this liberal offer remains. it is a gift of priceless value,
within the reach of all; Remember, only $12.50 for any disease. '

discussiox ofJimmigkation
causes display of feeling
Dr. Eliot Say* Thin Country Need*
All the Sound Brain and Brawn
Il'Ccn-Get.
.NEW YORK, Dec! 7. â The statistical dis
cussion was much enlivened in the_Clvic Fed
eration's national conference on immigration in
tho concert . hall of Madlson-.square Garden
to-day by sharp debates, colored with personal
feeling. . Several of the speakers now con
spicuous in the affairs of the country recalled
the - day many years \u25a0 ago when they entered
this country as immigrants, and remembering
that day. , resented with decided emphasis some
of the arguments In j favor- of limiting, white
immigration. Andrew Carnegie' declared:
"If I owned America and, whs runnine: it as
a buslncKo operation I would admit here every
man who has thn ambition to. enjoy the right*
of American citizenship; not only .would I
admit hirr., but I would Rive to every such
man a premium to come, nnd consider it the
best; bargain I ever made' in my life."
In the '-.morning: session the argument for
and against limitation of white Immigration
seemed evenly balanced. \ Robert S. Watchorn,
Commissioner of Immigration, told of condi
tions on Ellis Island, and admitted that with
the most careful enforcement possible of the
present laws undesirable immigrants get Into
the country. \u25a0
Dr. Eliot of Harvard jald this country
needed ail \u25a0 the sound brain and brawit It
could getâ every bit of the country needed
morÂ«-- human There was r.o difference
of opinion "any where as to the advisability of
excluding criminals and weaklings, but let
others come, .even though the influx' might
temporarily reduce wages.
"The American pub.lc means to welcome
them," he said. Capital, he declared, was
becoming more mobile every day. It was more
mobile than population, and if labor was not
allowed to come here capital would go "where
there was labor and a market.
: Samuel Gompers - said he could not under
stand liow some men In this country wanted
protection of products fend absolute free trade
In labor. He began to discuss the Chinese
question and v:as shut off, as that was re
served for discussion to-morrow.

i/ocal Stocks and Bonds.
The circular of Heaxelton & Co. sayi Â©t
â¢locks and bonds in November:
Busiest at the Stock and Bond Exchange
â¢ or.tinups pood, eales for Nofembe-r in listed
â¢c-curities amounting to $1,223,100 in bonds
â¢nd 55.:*99 shares, against $1,257.a0 In bond*
â¢nd iti.'.t.'iS shares in the previous month, and
V 1.071,000 in bond* and 50,342 In chares for
r."ovemb*T, 1904. The decrease in the volume
cf shares traded in was in sugar chares, of
which :-{<,:i->2 were cold in November, 1904.
â¢CaJast 2.>,tH}S ( n the same month this year.
Tli* l>ond market continues in excellent shape,
â¢-iTh a strong demand for the best known is
sues and only a very limited amount offering.
Monty Is cheap and in r:entlful supply, with
ii.rge amounts Â«*ekirsg investment, so that as
tax day approaches the demand for bonds will
Â»>ec<-ssari!> bocome more urgent. As the b^*t
known long established issues are now on a
very low interest basis investors may have
to lnve&tigaie the merits of newer securities
bearliiK a la!r rate of Interest and based on
. PittiK-rtie* of undeniable value.
l:i sugar shares business was active. Early
U\ the month prices were -weak, but later there
Â»a* a firmer fueling. The pliyeical conditions
ot the plantaticne are all that could be desired
â¢nd there is every Indication of a splendid crop
â¢ h:Â» season. -It is eÂ«tlmatea that Hutchinson
\u2666â¢ill enter the new year with all expenses paid
*nj a balance of more than $120,000. with the
now crop to hear from; while Hawaiian Com
mercial, after redeeming about $140,000 of Its
bonfia aad setting aside $100,000 for improve
ments, will have a balance of about half a
x \u25a0 : dollars; the coming crop from this
ilnntatioa Is estimated at more than 40.UC0
tons.
The bond business last month continued act
ive, with a firm demand for the best issues
a scarcity of offering*. This feature of
\u25a0â¢. c market will probably be accentuated after
\u25a0'\u25a0* ttr>t of th* ytar. and it is probable that
orni-ider^bie difficulty will be experienced in
r,. ! ;in? orders fn thle class of securities, except
cÂ» advanotrd prices, even in the face of tie
t-rcstut high ra&ge of values.

XETV YORK. Dec. 7. â Th<; . stock market
'â¢:\u25a0 ->zk\*"l apainst the severe stringency j n t he
:\u25a0 â¢ p\\ market to-day and eÂ«cai>ed without
Â»'-.: us* dsmag-e to value*. After the period of
1 1 \u25a0 \u25a0nil - weakness in the morning. In fact..
tl -si: \\<:n> arenerai recoveries under the influ
ence -of thr skyrockt advance in Tennessee
Coal and vieoroue upward movements in other
Sj"--ial ftneks. Money on -call was quoted as
ti'.ih a* 3<)'P<*r cent, thus* rising above the
previous maximum for the year touched last
morth. To-day's high rate in fact has not
Ixfr. equated \xtlcre since October. 1902. Tlie
Vhavlor of thÂ« stock market now and then
Sifforded a striking contrast. Money oondl-
Uona as strlnsrent as those of to-day could not
fail to depref-n the ctook market. But a gen
Â«-!-a! feature of comment was the ellghtness of
*< I tension as s result. Losses were not ex
cessive in any stock. It waÂ« notable also that
thf-y were quite uniform between 1 and 2
point*. Where the losses ran beyond the aver
age they were not found in the stocks which
I have been subject to the greatest speculative
kÂ»"ttvlty Jn the Smsnedlste past. In fax* these
\u25a0St.-.ares were conspicuously exempt In the un
favorable effect of the high rates for money.
The deductions drawn from this state of af
fairs- were that the organized speculation
which had been conducted for some time past
had provided Itself largely with time to an
swer before the scarcity developed In the
money market. tThe absence of forced liquida
tion at tbe present time on the part of large
operators of the part few weeks is capable of
no other explanation. The small effect pro
duced On vhe g-eiieral market warranted the de- <
durtion also that the participation In the spec
ulation otÂ» the part of operators dependent on
the ordinary resources of the money market
must be small. This Is In strong contrast with
the speculative position of IWO2. when enor
mous commitments had been made in the mar-
Jitt In dutreeard of the comin* election in
k-eneral business and the severe stringency de
velor^-d In the money market. What was
Known as tbe rich men's panic or the slow
panic followed st that time. It iÂ« & popular
supposition that the identity of this year's
speculative organization is the same at many
points as that of 1902. The difference In the
situation !les in tbe unclouded outlook for con
ditions underlying value* and the provision of
credit* beforehand for the conduct or operation.
Tli^ actual demand on each reserves in quite
sufficient to explain the degree of stringency
in the money market, but there can be no
doubt that the quality of some of the collat
eral offered forlcsns, especially some of the
flocks â¢which have undergone great Inflation
In the speculation has figured in the making
of rales. The stringency 15Â» the call money
market Induced decided stiffness In the time
ruar.ey market. There was evidence of a large
movement of funds toward this center, re
ports indicating a receipt of at least $1,000,000
from credit sources. The-eterllng exchange
rate also fell to below 455. which is lower than
the itoint touched during tbe last importation
of cold. This led to keen exixsctatlon of gold
e.*eapementE. The replenishment of the Lon
don money market by heavy payments for
redemption of exchequer bonds was looked to
f*. 1 facilitate such a movement. But no t en-
Ijwmrt-mcnt was made. Tbe closer, -working \u25a0of
fP^T>-y in other departments than the purely
Â»J"eitilatlve rea.wak.ened the expectation i that
the Secretary of the Treasury would be moved
to take some measure of relief for the money
r.a-iki t , which he had refused to do so lonjr as
jjurely speculative requirements were restrict
ed. -Confidence that such action was imminent
lind much to do with tbe late rally In stocks.
Tennessee Coal wrs especially affected by . the
conflicting- reports that "control had been se
cured of the company In the open market.
T.-tlcii va* reports wen cot admitted by pres-
ent controlling Interests. These contributions
fostered- the belief In a possible severe con
test in the open market for the balance of con
trol, with the possibility that the deliveries
of short stock already made might precipitate a
corner. Kanoas City Southern preferred re
epor.ded to rumors of a dividend, and other
stocks with Identical controlling interests were
affected in sympathy. Amalgamated Copper
showed resistance throughout and was promi
nent In the 6trong rally at the close. The
â¢whole market closed strong and with the
earlier losses almost universally changed to
varying trains.

Nevr York Cotton Market.
NKW YORK, Dec 7.â On disappointing cables
our market opened this week 5 ,to 12 point a
down. Tradlntr was active around the call
and yesterday's shorts covered freely. , The
n:arket went back to the previous close. The
official figures of the National Glnners' Asso
ciation . are somewhat' bearish, ' but . do not
eUnlty the size of the crop. The claim there
was SS per cent of the entire crop j sinned* to
December 1. Should this be - true it \u25a0\u25a0 means
a still smaller crop than many have figured on.
The National Glnners' report to December
1 tives 8,486.000' bales ginned, which they
claim Is SS per cent of the crop, and Indicates
a growth for the season, after Including Miners,
of about 9.850.0C0 bales. The report' also es
timates 92 per cent picked on December 1.
Private Liverpool cables say the National
Glnners' Association report has been published
there and is considered bearish, and Is one of
. the. causes of. the depression 'there this, morn-
Ing-. The weather conditions in the cotton belt
are much more favorable." Skies are generally
' clear, except in parts of Alabama and the
I southern portion of Eastern Texas,' ' where

which have prevailed all the week. All klndi
of Citrus goods wej-e_ In free supply and, as.de
from a limited : demand : for .the large sizes of
Navel Oranges, 1 ; there was very \ little doing In
that.llne. Japanese Mandarins bave met .with
very slow sal,? thus far an J. . although receiv
ers have tried to move tW- fruit . by cutting
prices, the . bulk Of . the recent heavy arrivals
Btlll remains In first: hands. Grapes were still
offering freely, but cold slowly, most of the
supplies being wet and otherwise poor. Some
fancy Isabellas sold up to SI Co per crate, but
for.'the other varlÂ»tles $1 25 was regarded^as
an extremis figure. -Strawberries sold at a
wide . range as to variety and quality. The
large varieties .. from . the Watsonvllle region
ware hard to move at any price owing to their
greenness. Longwortcs - were offering In. small

SALMONâ The LÂ«odon Grocers'; Gazette says
of Salmon conditions In England -in the latter
part of November: "The advance that we
t<ave recorded for the last two or three week.*
etlll continues and prices of all kinds of best
Salmon tend upward. . The quotations for 1-lb
tails ar* coming more Into line with those for
l'-lb fiats and >4 flats, and there Is reason to
believe that limits will ko higher, as there
1Â« a very large consumptive demand and stocks
are practically nil. Heavy forward tales hay*
beÂ«n made at constantly Increasing quotations.
The large demand of the last two months has
apparently made n big Inroad Into the 19C5
pack of Salmon. Alaska keeps steady."

OVERHEAD TROLLEY SYSTEM
IS FIRMLY OPPOSED.
The joint Supervisors' Street and Finance Committee yesterday listened Ho^pro-
Usts of property owners against the petition of the United Railroads to install an
overhead electric system on Sutter and Polk streets and Pacific avenue. ; The protest
ants prefer the cable system. The committee promises to report to-morrow. ,
Property Owners Insist on In
stallation of the Under
ground Conduits.
protest: to supervisors
The joint Committee on Finance and
Streets of the Board of Supervisors yes
terday resumed consideration of the pe
tition of the United Railroads for a per
mit to change the Sutter and Polk streets
cable Une into an overhead trolley sys
tem-
Interested property owners and repre
sentatives of the Sutter Street Improve
ment Club were again present in large
numbers to voice their protests against
the proposed disfigurement of the street*
with dangerous and unsightly poles -and
wires and to insist that a permit . be
granted to the corporation for an under
ground conduit system only.
A -week ago this committee of the
Board of Super\-isor6 met and decided
to ask City Attorney Percy V. Long
for an opinion on the right of the
United Railroads to change the present
conduit system on Sutter street to an
overhead electric â¢ system without be
ing granted a new franchise. Long
referred the Supervisors to the report
of. former City Attorney Franklin K.
Lane, who bad decided that the com
pany had this right.
Attorney Charles L- Wheeler criticized
the opinion of Franklin K. Lane, former
City Attorney, that the Supervisors have
the right to permit a change In the motive
power of existing street railroads with
out granting a new franchise. Wheeler
cited authorities in support of his conten
tion." that another franchise must be
granted to the United Railroads to
change the Sutter and Polk street eys
tems into overhead' trolley systems ac
cording to the charter provisions. He
said a mere resolution Is not sufficient for
the purpose, as such action would leave
the city at the mercy of a corrupt Board
of Supervisors, who would barter away
valuable privileges not contained in fran
chise* originally granted.
Wheeler argued that the privilege for
an underground conduit system, such as
demanded by 75 per cent of the property
owners along the route of the lines, could
be granted without a new franchise be
ing involved, because no one would raise
any legal objection to that course.
Tirey L. Ford, general counsel of the
United Railroads, stated that the City
Attorney had given two separate opinions
to the effect that the Supervisors can
grant the privilege noted. Referring to
"VY heeler's statement that a corrupt Board
of Supervisors couM offer for sale a fran
chise for a horse car line, for which only
interested parties would bid. and after
ward grant a permit for a different mo
tive power. Ford said the charter threw
all the proper safeguards around grants
of franchises, but admitted that no safe
guard could be takt;:i against probable
dishonesty of city officials.
WANTS COIHTS TO DECIDE.
Fcrd said that the\ point is one for the
courts to decide, and he felt sure that a
judicial determination would conform, to
Lane's opinion that a new franchise is
not necessary. He said the matter should
be judicially settled as speedily and ami
cably as possible. He referred to the
amended resolution submitted, which pro
vides for the grant of a permit to change
the mfctive power and states specifically
the following:
Provided, t'oit nothing in this resolution
fhaJl be so construed as to lessen or impair
any of the rights, duties or obligations of the
*\u25a0!;>â¢ and county of San Francisco, or of said
Vnited Railroads, tinder previous ordinances,

| resolution are that the poles shall be

j installed under the direction of the
, Board of Works; that one standard
. electric arc light shall be installed on
Sutter street at each principal cross
street from Sansome to Central avenue
with an additional light on each block
on Sutter street from Sansome to Van
Ness avenue, and that the electric
"feed" wires on Sutter street from
Market to Polk and the oross-town
line from Bryant straet to Pacific
avenue shall be placed under the sur
face of the street.
Ford said that many interested resi- ;
dents and property owners desired an '
j electric system In preference .to the j
I cable system and the United _ Railroads
is preparing to give a , "first-class |
j service on the lines in question. He
i argued that the charter provision that
"the Supervisors shall have no power
Ito grant franchises or privileges to
i erect poles or wires for transmitting
â¢ electric power or for lighting purposes
on the public streets, 'except upon cer
tain conditions, including competitive
bidding," did not apply to the propul
sion of street cars, but only affected
light and power companies. ' r
When Supervisor D'Ancona asked
what constituted the best system for
the purpose. Ford caused a laugh when
he referred the questioner to Expert
Parsons' report, filed with the Mer
chants' Association, that the overhead
trolley system is the best for San
Francisco. ir-'-M-:
QUESTION IS EVADED.
Engineer George H. Davis of the
United Railroads evaded a question put
by Brandenstein as to whether he
would press the application for an
overhead system on Sutter street in the
event that the same orivilege should
be refused on Market*street in view
of the declaration that it is desired to
"standardize" the^ systems. Davis said
.Jie would not apply for a permit for
an underground system, because it is
not as practicable as the overhead
system.
Patrick Calhoun stated that the
United Railroads realized that it would
be impossible to entirely standardise
its systems, but it was desired to make
them as uniform as possible, with the
use of elevators for the big hills. Cal
boun said the corporation had not come
to any definite conclusion as to . its
policy on M-rket street, but he adhered
to his declaration previously made that
the overhead system should be uni
1 formly installed as far as practicable.
I Calhoun said that if the permit fpr the
| overhead system on Sutter street is
I denied, the cable system would be con
tinued.
Brandehstein said the question which
involved the opposition of property
owners to the overhead system re
solved itself down to two points â
whether the poles erected 200 feet
apart and the installation of orna
mentaP light poles would be unsightly,
and whether the wires would be dan
gerous to life.
James D. Phelah said Mr. Parsons'
report is an imposition on the Mer
chants' Association, which had notified
him that it favored the abolition of the
overhead system, and that the desire of
the United Railroads -in .the matter
seemed to be one concerning the ex
pense only. He said no report o( Mr.
Parsons could gainsay the fact that the
underground system is the very best;
for this city.
Rudolph Spreckels held that the.
property owners are entitled to consid-'
eration and that he, as a large holder
of real estate on. Sutter street, would
prefer the cable to an overhead trolley
and his preference applied to Ellis
street as well. At this point the com
mittee took the matter under advise
ment and will meet Saturday afternoon
at Supervisor Braunhart's residence to
take formal action, which it i-s intimat
ed will be adverse to the petition.-

I testimony -yesterday ?; before" " United
States Commissioner Heacock. In ro
ply.to, questions by Assistant City At
torney, John â¢< S. Partridge Mr.; Dock
j weiler said that in order to arrive at
, a water rates charge upon a^reason
| able basis the Supervisors. have^ to con
1 sider the total cost "of operation, main
; tenance, reasonable interest on v the
j cost of the property in use andnse
| ful and the taxes. In making compari
sons with: rates elsewhere it should
Ibe considered, he said, that in San
Francisco there .are \u25a0 very; few days
when 'high temperature:' necessitates
extra drafts on; the system' and thero
is every advantage for a low rate of'
consumption.
(With reference to the proposition to
take water from the high Sierra the
witness quoted? from the. report of the
late Colonel George A. Mendell of the :
engineer 'corps: of the United States?
army, wherein the western slope of:
the Sierras, beginning at. an elevation'
of from 3000 to -4000 feet above- the.
level of the sea, thence to the summit
from 7000 to 9000- feet' elevation, are
pointed out as an ideal watershed
both for quantity and purity. This
territory, by reason of its altitude and.
conformation, will always remain un
inhabited and will always â¢ supply the
purest water .^n the world. 'he said, j-
In the very nature of things, \Mr.
Dockweiler continued, the .present
watershed used t by the 'Spring' "Valley
is bound to .increase in value and in
creased value means 'increased taxe^.
so that the expense of protecting that
watershed will ?bntinually -increase in
the future. Furthermore, it is against
economics to hold lands which couli
be used for other purposes, such as
farming, etc. . The Tuolumne system,
if , developed, â¢ could never be- in any
danger from human: activity or habita
tion. The steep slopes of the rmoun
tains and the granitic character of the
regio/i preclude the possibility of hu
man activity. With reference to the
capacity of this watershed the witness
said that the mean annual flow- for
the Tuolumne River . for the past nine
years from 1896 .to 1904. inclusive has
been 2664 second feet. San Francisco's
requirement, averages a daily 'con
sumption'of 35,000,000 gallons, or 54.2
second feet, which is slightly more
than 2 per cent of the average annual'
flow of the; Tuolumne.;
â¢ The minimum annual flow of that!
\u25a0river occurred in 1898 and it amounted
to 1182 second feet. Taking 710 sec
ond feet as the auantlty refluired â¢ for
irrigation there would: remain of this
minimum flow 472 \ second feet 'avail
able for domestic use for San Fran
cisco, or fdr nearly nine times, its
present consumption. The witness
added that he had gone over the
ground with Engineer Grunsky for
several weeks and that -he considered
the Grunsky scheme as entirely prac
ticable for the sum mentioned by him
âin the neighborhood of $39,000,000.
"Should anything be "/allowed the
water company for depreciation or de
terioration?" asked, Mr. Partridge.
The witness replied in the negative,
and' added that the- Spring Valley
Water Company always receives from
the ratea an \u25a0 allowance for mainte-;
nance and progress repairs, arid nas
received the sum 'with which rt has
replaced worn - out structures. Main
tenance is the 'result' of steady, repairs.
When deterioration is' allowed r to 'take
