strength, too. I had made up my mlrid
to find Kim before-I dickered more with
Menin. .\ Until I was sure Dulcine was
not in ttie* .imperial mausolerim, I
should believe she had i kept perfect
faith with me.Vand act on that' belief.
I lejt.'the legatlan- as secretly as I
had come, arid .went back to old Ky-
with frightened Jcrles, and then fell
asleep again, throughout the long day.
If possible, my jirÂ«ams were as har
rowing as^-my wiiking' thoughts.^ j
As often as I; awoke. I found Ky-"
sang, or faithful Pak at my side;- Pak
was indefatigable in my interest, bring
ing me, among other things, a basket
of luscious persimmons which grow
twice the size in Quelparte that they do
in America, and amply repay one's ef
fort to learn to like them. Whenever I
see this fruit now. I remember that
dreary, day I soent.in the little bell
house in Keinnlngâ and Kysang's
watch. -.'
- Some old-time friend of the bell
ringer at the English Legation had pre
â¢sented Kysang with a 'cast-off watch
which renewed the old roan' 8 desire of
long life. Ijt was a plain,' silver, open
cage affair, with a crystal rnonstrous '

Shocked af^ the profligate's request,
Kang boldly memorialized the throne
that he be putvto death. This raised a
tempest, and Kans was seized and con
demned to death. He was bound to a
cart to be driven to his execution, ac
cording to custom, with his crime
pasted in great letters uon his back,
"Arch traitor." I But when Cho Ta
rim's friends attempted to start the
cart, the bullocks could not move it an
Inch. .More bullocks were yoked on,
but to.no effect..
Then'; Kang, the , criminal, .laughed
arid said, "If you. will' remove this accu
sation from' my back*, and write 'Arch
patriot,' the cart will go."
.' For a time the ) ; angry crowd would
not listen, but at last when they obeyed
Kang's words the cart moved easily to
the place of execution, where" the vil
lainous sentence was carried out with
added zest because of Kang's laughter
and his magic power..' .

CtlAPTER XXVII. '
IT wai beginning to prow light in
the ea.Â«t as I went down to the
room where Colonel Oranoff lay.
I have often ' wanted to meas
ure the length of the great ball
of the legation, for I remember
it as being no less .than a day's
long march, measured by such thoughts
as those which were in my mind that
morning. I went as a man might walk
to the scaffold, thinking of- a 'year of
Jiis waited life- while lie took each step
toward- that life's <iuick"ciid. . -
Yet I yient ae'a man justified at the'
bar of his own conscience. True." I
migSt have adopted different courses
than those I had choeer. tince the de
struction of the Queen's body. I might
have asked Kepneff to bring me
Ftraight from Lynx Island to Tsi, and
then telegraphed Oranoff the whole
truth; but the little Dulcette- had not j
arrived yet from Han Chow, and I
would not have come in time, for the
funeral! I 'mipht have told Oranoff the"
truth when Dulcine told him my lie In
my vnry hearing; but : l thought the lie
tvas better and safer then than the
truth! I might have chosen 'not .to let
Dulcine find a woman to play the
Queen, but -that seemed .ttfen almost
my c/nly course, at least ' the safest
course. I could have refused to follow
the dare-devil Menin from the* dais.
But I could not have avoided the prov
idential escape forced upon me by the
faliinff of my horse, nor could I have
deme more than I had to find a way to
releaee Dulcine from the dark prison
v.'hcre she layâ unless I had been will
ins: to tell the whole tale to the Kin's
before first trying another alternative. ,
When I reached the door Dejneff held*
open. I v.as as ready to meet Oranoff
as 1 had continually been ready to an
*xver ever/ question my conscience had
thus far raised. True, I trembled; but :
innocent men do that sometimes. I
trembled at the thought of Dulcice. I
trembled for tear her father had been
seriously hurt. How came he here?
Had he failed to clear the country be
fore the storm broke? Or had he
learned cf Dulcine's absence and re
turned to throw his life away because I
had lost her so completely? Was it any
w<mder that he was out of his mind?
"We uent forward softly through the
ealon to the dimly lighted apartment'
beyond. Several menâ Rusian army
eurceonsâ were standing in the center
of the room looking at the bed, their
hands on their weapons. My eyes fol
lowed theirs, but at first I could hardly
see, coming as I had from a darkened
hall. Then some one turned up the
Uchts.
A gendarme 'was kneeling on the edge
of the bed holding its occupant under
him. And he was hf vlng his way, for
presently, with a etrange cry, the man
underneath sank back to the pillows. I
heard the click of handcuffs and knew
the struggle had been precipitated at
the sight of such cruel fetters. Then
the guard went off. the bed and stood
watch near by.
A way was tacitly made for me, and j
I approached the bedside quietly,
thouch I never took steps before or
rince so regretfully.
For a full minute I gazed downward
speechless and dumfounded upon the
fa^-e ofâ Sahib Menin!
The werewolf had played Ivan Oran
vTt oive too often! "
.For a moment I could not speak.
Then, lead with revenge, I leaned over
the man, -who I knew was watching
ine through half -closed eyes, and I
lifted the false imperial swiftly from
n'.t; face, and holding It aloft, I turned ,
to the astonished men behind me, say-

THIS is the fourth
and last install
inent of "The Queen
of Quelparte," the most

20 cents, an offer that

The pleasing feature
about The Sunday Call's

that there are not only

and exclusively timely.
As a particular in

the movements of the

how he is safeguarded

. .1 laid him mc%: .^.eply in my debt by
â¢howing him the regulator 1 and\.-..ex

so faster or slower as he chose. He
could';; not understand why one could
wish to make a watch go more' slowly,
whereupv*Bi I drew on hlB Idea of fast

'"Then, they would be just; together
again",- wouldn't they?" I asked him.
This was a + pu2zler, and he pulled out
his 'watch ;'and* sat down, looking
af it thoughtfully. Finally he . coin
cided wi^h my notion and affirmed that
he could, however, keep careful score
and be 'able to tell just how many
times arpundhe was ahead of the clock.;
His idea seemed tn.be that. the fastest
watch, like 'the . horse, was the
almost twice as many times as that
clock. . r

I went quickly toward her. Kim ]h&ifl

But all the time that white f*<flJ
stared wildly upon me. What coulfl |
that mean? The woman came neareHI
then quickly ran round me and eutereHi
Kysang's room. She fell across ttllj

"Kim has come, has he, Kysang?" I: |

saw a sadder face. f 1
"Aye, yes, boy; Kim has conie," tin

Yet the . smoke smelled better thasH

As I pushed on, I asked many ques-H
tions. Some I asked of the man before I
me. " Some I "asked myself; but to none I
.could I get or* give any answer. I won- I
tiered if this tumult could have been Â¦
occasioned by "Kim's loss of position. 1
Might it not be that the boy already 1
had sacrificed himself and hi3 station I
for us? Had he already found Dulcine I
and saved Her? This was too good to be j
true by any. possibility. He could not I
have known the identity of. the white I
form we together had borne into the/1
throne room that night, nor would he ' I
have read the message he brought me
from Dulcine. He could not have
known that the fall of the great tablet
had buried her within the Queen's mau
soleum. And yet I remembered with a
start .that Prince Tuen's wily servaC^i i

guessed it all and had acted swlftly( I
and triumphantly on the basis of thei3|H

But while I struggled with these f earsM
and hopes, we came to Kim's housc^B

for me to decide to rest for;,the [ day; in

beyond, telling though. I was, to reach'
Dulcine;, I. determined to gain a little of
the | strength j I needed, and Kim ,

> "Gentlemen, let me present a hell-
J hound of Prince Tuen's, Sahib Menin."
Their exclamations were lost on my
earsâ but, oh! the oath hissed into that
pillow did my heart a great good!
The daylight bade me hasten, for I
could not remain in the legation with
out Dulcine, and Ling must be found or
I must go to the King.
"You made a fast run to Chcfu, Sa
hib Menin," I said.
"Peste!" he growled, "as fast as your,
message went there."
The villain was unmasked. He spoke
now, as tierce and domineering as ever
i in that mountain hut. It made my
blood boil! But I swallowed my anger
and determined to play with my defiant-
mouse a bit. â¢ A
"Instead, you came here, sharpened
the teeth of your trap, and stuck your
own leg in it;" and I laughed a* heart-'
ily as though laughter and not groans
had been my whole portion jof late. But
Menin laughed tooâ that same hellish
grinâ and I wanted to spring at*, his
throat.
"Where Is your launch?" I 'asked
quickly, for I could not beat the bush
longer; "tell the truth now for once; I
promise you will pay death for each
. "At Chefu," he answered calmly.
"Then, sir"â and I had determined
upon my course anticipating this lying
reply â "in an hour Admiral Holstrem of
the Russian fleet will have your boat
found and searched."
The man's eyes were coals of fire.
"Then he will find a dead woman in
it." ' '
I had turned away, but this drove me
back. mad.
"Then, by the Lord God, I will come
back and shoot you where you lie till
you are dead," I cried and turned on
my heel again. â¢
"So my life Is worth more to you
than hers?" The reply, half a reflection,
half a question, unnerved me utterly,
but I strode on toward the door deter
minedly..
Did ever a man ache as I did at that
moment? If Menin let me go now, it
was because either his men â¢ did not
have Dulciire or he was" ready to die
the death 1 named (If, as he had said,
his life was worth more to me than
hers)! 'And here he had me. By the
Lord, if he. my prisoner, was not the
master still!
I thought all this out as I strode to
the curtains of the salon- door, but
there I turned and looked back. , I
could not help it." â¢ â¢
And" all the answer the : dart-devil
Rave me was that hellish laugh. Hark!
I can h*ar it nowâ loud, clear, defiant. '
and eroding in an unknown oath!

ft was foolhardy to run useless risks,
and my : hand dropped nerveless when
I strove? to sign Oranoff's name to the
order I. had written.
As I lay/ on the table perplexed,, a
.happy alternative occurred to me. I
could at least prove Jlenin's words con- ~
cerning the .presence of his launch. off'
Chefu, and in a moment I substituted
this query for the order I could not dare
to send: .â¢ '. 'Â¦:-^. :

I'culckly reduced this to cipher and
had Jt sent Einging on its way.
Then I went back to my. mouse.- It .,
v.ould be an hour befor.e I could nail'
Benin's first lie. And I thought of
other things to ask him. p
"In an hour. Sahib Menin, your Ifes
wil'l be thrown back in your .teeth," I
Â¦ began; "in the meantime you will do
well if you tell the truth."
"Jamie! but you are a fool, 1 ' he !
growled; "think you Prince Tuen's pri- â¢..

I- ignored the words in. proportion .as ',
they affected me. For the first time '

"Aye, and sunk.atits berth, if your
words prove' true," I retorted. â¢ ,
"Oh, ' but," you are a fool," the man.
snarled, and turned over to his pillow,
ignoring fny presence absolutely. J
I began to feel 1 now. that^I dealt in '. -
truth, with no common villain,:.' and Â¦''
also, with a gust of anger, that I played
poor hands as master. ' However false
Menin was otherwise, he was truly 'Â¦

2was not a hopeful omen. For aught I
knew he had looked upon Dulcine's
dead body, but I fought such fears
away with desperate hope and laid out
quick'.y my. next step.
Sending Pak to the legation for
horses. I followed him back to the bell
house to wait, and while there I made
a large bundle of white strips of cloth
from a couple of Kysang's coats I found
on his wall.
Pak came and we were off at a gal-
vere priests at the temple, and Kim
had been somewhere there holding
vatch over the Queen's body even as
his old father had watched it at Lynx
Island. I must reach that temple of
the .tomb before the* men in black
reached it. I did not doubt that they
would have other business in Keinning,
and with haste I might outride them
and reach their temple first.
I -did not stop to wonder what had
unsettled Kim â though his condition
Those tongueless men in black! Why
had I net guessed it all before? They
As for m<\ I called my boy, and went
quickly out into the night. I knew I
need not look for more he!p from Kim.
It would be days, perhaps weeks, before
he would recover. What was to be
done I must do alone and do quickly.
I pulled Pak into the dark and asked
him how Kim had come home.
"He was brought by the men in black
who are priests at the temple of the
tomb."
I put the lantern on the floor before
the huddled, trembling form of the
youth. I backed quickly into the farth
est corner, and the silly face followed
me. Here in the darkness I drew
Nsase's swe-rd. I had not looked upon
it before tave in daylight, and now It
shone like the very sword with which
s'ic danced. I had not ctvung It once
over my head before the dull eyes
opened wider. Noting the advantage,
I whirled the b!ade bravely before me
and rushed down upon the prostrate
form of Kin^. Lin?. He cowered back,
displayfng> by sir deiner. the first sign
of mental activity. I threw the sword
iii. the r.shen fnce and shouted in the
lad's ears. I seized the back of his long
cost and threw him to his feet. Then I
epoke sternly, even fiercely, my mouth
not an inch from the quivering eyelids:
"The Queen lives, Kim; tell me she
lives! Long live the Queen!"
The next moraer.t seemed an eternity
to me. Physician* never watched the
action of a potent drug, when life was
hanging by its slenderest silver thread,
with mere anxiety than I watched the
effect of these words upon that disor
dered brain. I could see them burn
deeper and deeper, as the seconds
passed. One by cr.e the quivering mus
cles relaxed. One by enc each wild
light died out of his eyes. Then the lad
slowly raised his hand and saluted me
with his first particle of sentient
strength, murmuring thickly:
"Aye â the Queen lives â long live the
Queen!"
Then he fainted, and I laid him In his
mother's lap. But she saw the change
In the face, listened to the regular,
quiet breathing, and wept over him for
very joy.
<juickiy and shut the door In those star
lag faces.
I was desperate. Failure here and
now meant a confesrion to the King.
I could not, would not. fail. I felt if I
could set one hint from Kim, Dulcine
niJ?l;t be saT<?d. I felt Instinctively
that h!s condition was attributable in
some wav to the terrible farce we had
played. He must have seen Dulcine,
and tlie shook had unbalanced him. I
I:nevr a mind unhinged by fright could
be aroused again only by a like shock
of equal violence, and I acted on, this
theory. â¢ Â» ; â¢ /
Only a moment after, Pak seized my
arm convulsively. I leaned toward
him. He did not even whisper! but
with his hand turned my head. I
looked into the blackness beyond, but
could see nothing. Then the soft tread
of sandaled "eet sounded outside the
temple. The sounds came nearer. They
mounted the steps. The matting was
drawn aside, and two men entered.
The two In black had returned from
Keinning! .
My dearest hope was realized! We
crouched lower, but I watched the two
intently. In the dim gray light their
black gowns could be easily followed.
They stealthily crossed the large room
to where the altar stood, y There they
stopped, but then as I looked upon
them, plain to be seen there in the dim
Iteht, they vanished from sight!
I leaped to my feet. I could see more
plainly now; no one was near the altar,
and with a stern word to Pak, I drew
Nsase's sword Â¦ and rushed forward.
The hideous image stared down upon
me as though frantic with fear. I did
not blame it- The candles on the altar
were burned out, but around it on each
side I felt the hangings of heavy tapes
try. I pushed one of these, and it gavts
way. Instantly I bent down and nearly
fell into a hole through the floor, which
had not been closed up.
Sheathing the sword, I crawled under
the hanging and let myseir down. My
feet reached a step, and I stood and
turned about. The step â¢ rested on a
floor of stone flagging. It. seemed light
er at my feet, and I bent over. Then I
saw a narrow passageway four feet
high and thrice as long, with a .torch
burning at the end.
And it led straight as an arrow to
ward the mound!
Drawing my sword again, I crouched
down and went swiftly where. the pas
sage paved with stone led. No wonder
It took time to build the mausoleum if
a stone-ballasted underground railway,
was a necesary adjunct! By the torch
was a paper door, standing ajar. - I
looked beyond and saw the two were
standing in a hallway beside an open
door with others near them. The hall'
was some six feet in height, and ex
tended on into the dark, but ever
straight toward the tomb.
My plan was not to be achieved by
I spent my time trying to remember
the details' of the temple. But all I
could recall was the dais upon which
the golden sarcophagus had rested be
hind the yellow curtains. I think we
entered the building nearly where the
hideous impersonation of Oranoff had
stood and lured me away. I shudder
even now as I remember that face! If
I was right, then the altar was beyc-nd;
I trusted to luck, and we crawled far
along and stopped behind a screen
which had been discarded since the fu
ne.'al."'
It struck 2. In the first dim gray of
morning I could make out the outline of
the pillars of the temple. The corning
of morning would change my plans.
Yet while I was waiting I undid my
heavy bundle and took out a quantity
of white bands. These I wound about
my arm and legs, Pak assisting me.
wondering but silent. Then I wrapped
my body closely, and, lastly, my neck
and head, leaving a slit to see through.
I took "Pak's long white cloak, such as
all Quelpartiens wear, and bound it
about my waist for a skirt, winding
the scabbard of Nsase's sword in white
and hanging it at my side. We worked
desperately, and it grew lighter. Fi
nally I lay quietâ and ready.
CHAPTER XXIX.
4 The chime of half-oast 2 rang out
from the city. We lay still as Indians â
my boy Pak and I. We ccuM not even
see each other, for it was the darkest
hole I was ever.in. Yet iny plans could
wait, if necessary, until morning light.
And what I was hoping for might hap
pen before then â if we were not too
late.
of ground on which the building stood*
We then climbed -upward and entered
tha building. I /
I breathed a prayer and crept up
ward softly, for I remembered how I
was dressedâ thei;e- were no others I
cared to frighten!
At the too was a little room some
eight feet square in which was a couch
lying along the wall. Before.it on the
floor a paper lantern lay on its side;
the flame ha a hole through it.
The candle Â¦Â»*% still long and would
remaining unseen. I waited just a mo
ment. Then I threw the door open and
rushed upon the group, waving . my
sword. -With gestures of alarm, .the
men fell across the threshold and shut
a heavy door as I flew by.- The moan
ing coming from that room has not yet
ceased to ring: in my ears. I pitied
men so superstitiousâ and yet I must
have made a wild sight as a Queen's
soul rampant!
I did not stop here, for I knew that
door would not be opened soon. Â¦ I went
on. I came to a flight of stone steps,
almost a stone ladder, ascending very
straight. .Jrvf-
A cry of joy rose to my quivering
lips. I sheathed Nsase's sword, and as
cended silently. The steps' were in a
round shaft dug in the soft limestone,
perhaps five feet In diameter. As I
slowly ascended, the air became heavy,
and I caught the dense scent of spices
and balsam.
I crept to the couch on which Kim
had lain, where I sat still, thinking, for
my plans had now to be readjusted. As
I sat there I remembered Kim and
thought how nearly I had guessed the
truth! The boy, like the father, sat
facing the King's precious treasure â
never to leave it save for short visits
to his home. What a life that' had been
for the lad to look forward to!
Would that white-haired boy ever re
turn? I doubted it. For this must ever
be. to him the most dreadful place in
the world. ! Here he sat In -the* dim light,
gazing idly, perhaps, through . those
heavy bars.- Suddenly the golden cover,
have lasted Kim all night, I thoughtâ
for this was surely: his room. - The lan
tern,' lying: whe^ he ' had knocked it,
proved 'the; room had not been ' entered
by /the men in black, and' I knew they
would not come now! ; . " ' K _-
All this passed through my mind ere
I mounted the last step. ' My face was
even with " the- curtain; of ;the wall, and
tny eyes :' did not fall upon the heavily
barred 'window In it until I was "fairly
atthetopof the stairs. I sank quick
ly; to my knees and crawled to it. The
light . cast by the bright candle fell
ddwnward, and, panting, I raised my
self to the; corner of the window and
looked down. At first all was darkness,
but then, as once before in the temple
of* Ching-ling. a long, bright,, shining
objects appeared* slowly in the. gloom,
and :my eves rested full on the golden
sarcophagus of -the Queen!
It -was only by exerting my utmost
strength- that I'kept from leaping to
the. window' and crying out, -but I
feared the shock of the sudden greeting.
Besides, . my hands . were around the
great Iron bars, and these tempered my
exultation and set me thinking. l ?.\'$J.
; The window was two feet square,
four great bars two inches In diameter
being planted in the solid masonry, in
thte hope of keeping the Queen's soul in
Its gloomy cell.
. and we hurriedly, brushed the white
1 rags Into a corner, t
1 Then I walked to the center of the
: room, making a loud noise with my
Â¦ boots, and there I uttered a long hal
loo. I repeated it soon vehemently, but
I had to wait some little thne; it took
> courage for them to open that door
again t /
A door finally opened slowly on the
far side of the building, and those
twelve tonsruele33 creatures dresed In
black entered, paralyzed with fear,
even holding one another's # hands. The
door blew shut behind them, and every
one whirled about with a gasp.
But they knew me, or at least my
uniform quieted them, and I treated
them as roughly as any Russian as
they filed to the long bench to which I
pointed.
Pak was my interpreter, but, on my
oath, I knew not what to gay first.
"The great King," I began at ran
dom, but in a^very loud voictr. "desires
to know if all is well in the temple ot
the tomb."
The row of liars nodded affirmatively,
looking sideways at each other to see if
they agreed.
"Tour rooms are comfortable?" I
queried.
"Yes."
'The service and appointments of tha
temple are complete?"
Again thev nodded.
I was stil! playing for time, bat I
now gave up in despair and blurted
cut:
"Send for General Kim Ling."
A9 Pak repeated this, tne poor men
shook like beech leaves in March. One
of the two attempted to talk on his fin
gers, but gave it up quickly with a
groan. Then he arose and pointed to
ward the city.
I Interpreted the gesture by asking:
"Keinnlng?"
And all the gaping heads nodded.
"He is satisfied with His Majesty's
arrangements?"
I put this lie into the tongueless
and they swallowed it whole,
each looking blankly at his fellow as ha
wagged his head.
There was something ghastly ridicu
lous about it all. and I kept from
laughing only with effort.
But I saw Pak was growing pale and,
alarmed, I cut short this scene by com
ing to the point.
"His Majesty feared lest, in the com
motion caused by the funeral, the tem
ple might have been neglected and
might now be wanting for some neces
sity,' or that actual use might have
shown the need of chance. He is par
ticularly anxious" â and I whispered
the words and made Pak dp soâ "lest
the bars cf the Queen's window are so
far apart that her soul would attempt
to escape."
The words told awfully on the trem
bling men. They fairly writhed. One
arose to speak, forgetting in his excite
ment that his tongue had been re
moved. He sank to the floor. Another
attempted to talk with his fingers, but
they shook beyond all reading.
The Quelpartien idea of a soul's tak
ing human form Is matched nowhere,
perhaps, save among that tribe of
American Indians who leave a space in
their funeral procession where the soul
of the deceased may walk before the
corpse.
I remembered that these men in black
were the masons and carpenters of tha
Imperial mausoleum, that they planned
and built the tomb- the watcher's cell,
the window, and the passageway
thither from the temple of the tomb.
At last, after a confused wrangle, one
man arose, stood before me, and held
his quaking hands far apart, nodding
wildly.
"Are the bars too wide?" I asked.
Pak repeated my question, and a
dozen heads began bobbing violently.
Then I reprimanded them severely
(not asking for further proof), and
roughly ordered that the error be cor
rected. â¢ "
Holding the package I carried more
tightly under my arm, I started for the
door through which the priests had en
tered the room, and when I saw they
stood aghast at my presumption, I
turned to Pak and told him that the
King had ordered the altar passage
closed up.
These words had their effect. They
knew I was about niy business. Then
I ordered them to get their tools to re
move the heavy stone In which the
bars were planted, since double the
. number of holes must be drilled In it.
This . work could not be done in the
tomb, so the stone must be carried '
away. Fortunately, like the great tem
ple, the sound of a hammer and mallet
must not be heard here.
I led the way, entering the higher
hall by a passageway I had noticed la
my previous hasty incursion and no one
being near me, I mounted the stone
steps, as careful now to step heavily as
I had been careful before to step light
ly. Once at the top, I ran to the barred
window and cried:
"Dulcineâ it Is Robertâ lie still until
I come."
Utter silence reigned In that dim
room. â¢ I wondered If Dulcine had
fainted. Oh, the agony of that next
half hour!
The priest3 came up fearfully, and
went to work. The activity made men
of them again, and soon the base stone
was loosened, and they looked at me
for the order to remove it, wondering,
nd doubt, if I would guard the window
while the change was made. I gave
the word by an eager gesture. They
lifted it, and all went with It down the
steep stairs. They were glad to get
away from that black, open hole.
And; oh. was I not glad to have them?
In a moment I had rushed headlong
through it, down into that mass of cake
and spice. My first thought was of the
chill of the room as I floundered down
into the space between the wall and
pedestal on which the sarcophagus
rested.
Then I was up again and over the
sarcophagus. . It was closed. With a
groan I fumbled" at the cover, and as I
-wrenched at it. it slid along. It was not
fastened within.
'_, My eyes were now on the long glass
lid." I opened it, andâ the sarcophagus
â¢was as empty as the tomb. â¢

' I remember going down the atone
stalr3 and finding Pak and telling him
to take me home. I remember coming
â¢back on the horse, but Pak must have
done most of my riding for me. When
I reached the legation old Dejneff took
me into my room, and before I loat
track of things entirely,- 1 know I asked
him to telegraph Colonel Oranoff to"re
turn to Kelnning.
' I believed then that Menin had really

he had told me she wasâ on that yacht'

to save her I could not tell. I had done
all I could do, and I felt that my mind
was letting go of the problem with

have thrown himself headlong down
those stone steps; little wonder the men
in black heard his awful cry; little
wonder that, when they found him, it

dured such a strain and retained its
delicate equilibrium.
All this scene passed through my
mind in a moment's time. Scon I had
altered my plans to meet the new con
ditions, and I righted the lantern,
looked once more upon the golden cas
ket, and leaned for a moment In prayer
against the heavy bars.
Then, placing the lantern on the
couch, I drew my sword and. went down
out cf the room swiftly.
THE SAN FRANGISCOC SUNDAY: CALt.
As the cathedral chimes rang out 2
o'clock, we were tying the horses in a
clump cf bushes half a mile from the
temple. Then circling around, we made
our way softly through the gloom. I
know not what Pak took for a guiding
star, but with great certainty he
brought me to the foot of the little rise
3"It's every man for himself, and all
of us for the lieutenant. Fight, ye
devils, and let us have no wailing over
a hurt or two."
It was twenty to forty, and if there
was any moral advantage it was off
set by the forty being undercover.
It was a case of snapshooting â of
sunning â of stealth. The kid had a
zoo! head, and his nerve was with
him. He moved along the line from
flank to f.ani{, encouraging and direct
ing and pausing for a moment here
and there to lift up the musket of a
wounded man and flee a shot himself.
Thd twenty pressed the forty back
slowly, hut at fearful cost. At the
end of half an hour the scrseant re

came the report of a single rifle and a
bullet dashed the boy's cap off. The
Indians discovered that they were be

There was a, smile of happiness on the
war party of forty In the snow. It
led to the east. The patch on the sole
of each moccasin meant the war trail,
and that peace no longer existed. The
band was going toward Plum Valley.

great armchair, hta face thrust Into
his hand, the steady eyes upon the
writhing blades and lighted by the re
flected fires. la the position he had
happened to assume, one shoulder was
higher than another, and a tinge of thr
old fear of Sahib Menin ran through
me as I looked covertly at htm. r w .'
Beside ma sat Dulcine, and I looked
at her as I felt for her nand in the
dark.;- She was gazing intently upon
; the â¢ mad dance, = hut is I f onnd her
hand she looked tip at mo quicklyâ even
as she looked that night In my room
in. the : ; Russian Legation In Keinning
Â¦w hen she : had . arisen : bo | strongly ; to
such a deed of ' infinite daring.' Sly
thought became her own, and we
kisaed each other there In the gloom.
And as I looked again for a lait time
from face to face, and then once more
upon ttiat thing cf firÂ© ttfcTÂ» cf, Qutl
parte-with 1 the tender -vistas of its
paddy-fields, its white-robed inhabi
tants, their myths and superstitions,
gray old Keinning and its secret which
the broad river Phan still bears with
sealed lips to the sea came back to me
as it can never come again until I sec
those same; faces lighted as they were
that night by the trembling flashes
shot from the sword-dancer's blades.
We find life in St. Petersburg ex
ceedingly pleasant, and my duty' as
captain in the Czar's Cuirassiers is not
the prosaic thing that I had anticipated
"after West Point," as we were wont
to say, as though expecting to be burled
alive! Colonel Oranoff is with us fre
quently, though now I must call him
Prince Mcranoff; he has a fine estate
to-day far down on the Danube. His
bold stroke In Quelparte, which gave
Port Arthur to Russia without costing
an ounce of powder, was a final tri
umph, and the Czarâ that "hardest and
best-served master in the world" â am
ply repaid his servant.
The Prince's busiest hours are spent
in the Foreign Office here in St.
Petersburg, for he is a high officer
now in that silent army which is for
warding fast old Peter's dream, -^j.-.
When I read a story, I like to have it
close quickly at the end, and now I
have told mine my aversion to overtold
stories rises up to bid me pause. Yet
there is one scene that belongs to this
little drama which began in far-away
Quelparte, that was acted here in St.
Petersburg, which I cannot omit. We
had not been settled here long before
Dejneff came, and then to our great
surprise Prince Meranoff brought us
one day an invitation to dine with the
Czarâ to whom this story of Quelparte
had been told. Of course Dejneff was
included in the invitation â and even
Nsase! All the details of the visit I
left gladly to Dulcine and her father.
And there, to the Czar and Czarina,
Mrs. Martyn told her story, while the
rest of us put in our parts as we were
appealed to for them. Emperor Nicho
las was particularly Interested in the
myth of insanity coming upon relatives
of desecrated dead. I remembered he
was silent whilÂ« we .were laughing at
a sober comment which Dejneff put In,
and which the Czar plainly heard.
But when Dulcine had finished, the
Czarina came and kissed her passion
ately, though Nicholas said slowly in
French, "But the end is not yet." Then
he told of the later plotting of Tuen
against Whang-Su and other things of
which even the Times does not tell. At
last Dulcine forgot host and hostess
and arose unsteadily from her chair,
and when she spoke her voice sounded
like a child's cry:
"I do not care for sequels, your Maj
esty."
Nicholas sat looking quietly at the
flowers as the ladies moved away, the
Czarina's arm thrown around Dulcine,
but murmured low, as to himself, "Nor
do I, madame."
In an adjoining room, heavily cur
tained at the center, we found happier
themes for conversation, when, to my
utter surprise, the room suddenly be
came darkened. Dulcine pressed my
hand assuringly, and I saw the surprise
was for me. The heavy curtains
parted, and there In the half-light
stood Nsase, a shining sword in each
handâ to dance before the Emperor!
In the mountains of Quelparte she
had danced for my life; now Nsase
danced as for her very own. The
tiger-skins, her only raiment, her long
black hair again wrought into those
snakellke Braids, the swords bewilder
ing in their myriad convolutions, were
wonderfully beautiful. Though the
tragic element, so vital In her perform
ance In that mountain cave, was miss
ing, yet there was an added glory here.
The luxurious room, the deep carpet,
the heavy hangings, the gilded tinsel of
ornate frescoing, were much in keeping
with the brilliant performance. The
wavering lights, which, as I saw them
before, were lost on the dull sides of
that mountain cave, were now flashed
back from a thousand glittering sur
faces.
I sat at the end of the- little semi
circle and could look unobserved upon
the distinguished little audience. The
Czar and the Czarina now saw a thing
new even to their eyes; they lost not
one curling ray of flre, not one reeling
bolt, not one bright crash of flame.

Peking."
And before night fell there arose
from the water the hills of Port Arthur
and on the great mast, above Ihe basin
of solid masonry in which the huge
dredges lay. floated the dc-uble eagles of
Russia â Peter's dream had come an
other hundred leagues nearer its real
ization!
"Wrong again," the wretch answered,
even now no whit dismayed; "he laughs
best who laughs most!"
"Silence!" burst out Oranoff, and Me
nin'c Â«ves narrowed to a slit and went
to him.
"Robert, what of this man?" said
Oranoff to me., V:v:- /V- 5 :
"Everything" I asked, knowing
only too well that I could tell nothing
unless I told it all.
"Everything, if so God gives you
breath."
I began with Lynx Island, though
acknowledging freely that I was not
sure Menin was there; I told of the ac-
That hall was not so long to-night!
. The room at Its end was dimly
lighted, but the occupant of the bed
fully recognized me when I entered,
and he knew, I am sure, the man who
came wonderingly after me. The Cos
sacks stood erect as we came In. and
Colonel Oranoff went straight to the
foot of the bed. I turned on a full
flood of light.
The snarl from the pillows was not
more suggestive than the soft "Oho"
that broke from Oranoff's lips as his
form straightened 'and his hands
clutched the heavy footboard. '
There was silence a moment as the
two looked each other face to face.
"He laughs best -who laughs last," I
said with my usual triteness. Then
Sahib Menin turned and looked at me.
The glance was worth having lived
long to see! Dulcine had been under
thiB very roof when toe had boasted
of having possession of her and he
knew I did not know that it was false.
He had staked as heavily on my evi
dent ignorance of the fact that he had
released Dulcine and turned her over
to Dejneff, as he had on making me be
lieve her away on Tuen's yacht. â¢ He
looked upon me as the criminal looks
upoty the hound that has brought him
into the fiercer clutches of the law.
CHAPTER V XXXII
In my turn I told of meeting Menin
in the mountains, of his threat, of
Xsase and Kysang and Kim, of finding
Menin at the Legation and of my esca
pade in the temple of the tomb.
It was during one of these long talks
in the salon that Colonel Oranoff ar
rived. He kissed Dulcine fondly, hold
ing my hand the while affectionately.
Then he turned.
"You sent for me, Martyn?"
"Yes," I replied simply; "come, and I
will show you why," and I led him to
Sahib Menin.
Poor Kim! The first shock had been
a cruel one, which, through each hour
in his own cell, watching a casket he
knew was empty,, preyed upon his mind
until he became what I found him.
preparing herself for ths unusual role;
she told me of the hours in the throne
roomâ of how she would have given
anything she possessed to have been
able to laugh In the King's very face!
Blinded as she was, of course nothing
of the pomp and majesty of the mum
mery impressed her, and she only* saw
the absurd side of it all. She told me
of the long journey to the m?-usoleum
and the terrific jolting she received
within that rude cart; before the tomb
was reached she had removed the light
bands from her face and hands and
the white robe which she wore aver
her own fur coat. When the"" signal
came she was ready to step out and go
away in her most ordinary costume;
no, she was not frightened and had
never once thought of not being re
leased; the fear cf this had never come
to her! The only unusual incident had
occurred when she opened the sar
cophagus; a young Quelpartien army
offlcer was hidden behind the curtains,
evidently a secret guard. When she
lifted the glass cover and sat up the
young man fell with a groan through
the curtains upon the floor. Dejneff
had drawn the body aside and left it
there.

It was three days before Colonel
Oranoff could come; but three days*
time was not too long, for Dulcine and
me to put together the mazy story of
those mad hours now past. It seemed
as though the. days were not long
enough, there was no much to tell and
euch happiness in the telling. Dulcine
told roÂ» of her decision to play the
Queen's part and of her difficulty In

"Noâ betâ wfewnâ filfl you censo to

"Who released you, Dulcine?" I could
not think of any smoother introduction,
and the question came bluntly, crowded
by the host of other questions behind it.
"Father, of course; who else could,
and when did you tell him, Robert'"
Her ' father!' r "Oh, Menin," I cried
out in my beating heart, "you good
mixer of lies and the truth!"
"He forgot the signal, though, Robert,
and rapped twice; but then hÂ« rapped
three times a moment after. He was
v*ry nervous, and the moment Dejneff
came he told him to take me home."
"Dejneff came?" I asked, breathing a
prayer that the- faithful old soldier's
days might be long and happier ones
than these had been.
"Yes; the moment I was out and on
my feet. Father was Just taking me in
his arms. He trembled so I was glad
Dejneff came, for Colonel Oranoff was
In a hurry to catch the morning boat to
Chefu."
"He took you In his arms?" I mur
mured through my teeth. Then I
cursed the man under my breath. But,
oh, how boldly ha had played. What
hellish, hopes were Menin's when he
held in his arms the daughter of Ivan
Oranoffâ through whom he was sure of
driving me to the King with my con
fession!
I felt that some one was leaning over
me, for shortly after the hand became
lighter and began moving softly back
and forth. Its tender touch ran deftly
like a woman's from one burning tem
ple to the other. It lingered anxiously
now and then on roy forehead, and
again srew heavy as though its pos
sessor was looking intently over me.
Now it brushed back my hair, which
was wet with perspiration; it held the
damp, hot mass away, and then it
came back to the old -course from one
hot temple to another.
I knew that handâ but I feared I was
dreaming or in a delirium. I opened
my averted eyes, and, braving the
bright sunlight. I looked about the
room. Pak was in a far corner spread-
Ing down a tiger-skin which had been
having an airing; I turned my head
slightly, and there before the flre sat
Dejneff, looking as ever into his great
beard and humming a song softly as
ha studied. Then suddenly he sat up.
and I closed my eyes as he arose and
came over toward the bed.
"Miss Oranoff," he Eaid (and, oh, I
ground my teeth in agony that the
dream should be bo real!) "I believe I'll
ehave."
A cheery laugh arose behind me.
"You could then sing much better, I
am sure," answered Dulcine Oranoff as
sweetly as in real life.
Dejneff grunted, for the men always
taunted the old soldier of his fine "bar
rel-tone" voice; but he called Pak and
went out of the room. <
Dejneff shave! It was too real, too
true â too good to be true! I fell back
and looked the other way. While the
vision lasted I would look upon the one
who laughed and spoke behind me!
And Dulcine Oranoff clasped me in
her arrr.p repeating those brave last
words, "We will never part. Robert"
After a eweet, long silence together I
began to realize my dream was real.
During that time even the crowd of
questions that soon after came to my
lips were Bwallowed up in perfect Joy.
The one great question waa answered;
my great, killing fear was dead! I
sobbed while I kissed her hands, and
at last drew her own wet face to mine
and held it there until the doctor's soft
step at the bedside aroused us. When
he had looked me over and prepared, his
glasses and gone again, his eyes twink
ling all the time, I gave my hungry
questions the right of way.
I fell asleep as the sun began to red
den the windows, and it was not until
the morning of the day following that I
awoke. For a. time I lay still with Â«ny
eyes achlnsr at this first glimpse they
had of the light- I felt too weak to open
them again, and lor a few moments I
was only conscious of the pain in them.
Then a hand touched my brow!
which It had struggled, and vainly, for
so many hours. It was hard to think
that Dulcine was in that cold torab suf
fering I knew not what; but to think
that 6he was a captive on that boat
well. I could not. for my brain refused
to be urged further, and sank down un
der its load like a spent horse.
he felt outwitted, and the light of fear
that was now unmistakably present
neither looked nor felt natural. His
hands moved nervously; the fingers
twitched.
I went mechanically to the table
where I had thrown the false beard,
and the poor: wretch accommodated me
by raising his head that I might ad
j'just it; on him*.
."Isn't this imposing on an impostor?"
he askedi with something of the old
recklessness in his voice; yet the tone
cjjed away pitifully, before all .the words
were but. One pities the wildest and
fiercest of animals when once brought
f hopelessly to bay. , r : ~'7 : ':
I felt that- Colonel "Oranoff would
move swiftly now -this man was once
In his hands. I could not guess, though
for three hours I thought intently,
what course he cc-uld pursue. But the
one fact that- Menin was now "Colonel
Oranoff" was a thrilling omen of what
was to "come. I remained at the bed,
and it was not until near midnight
that there was any noise in the build
ing save the low rattle of the telegraph
instruments in the telegraph room
- acros3/the hall. Â¦ I knew Menin "heard
.these; he. held his head cocked above
Â¦his pillow, and it was plain he was
studying the . messages through the
thick%all. But he could not read them,
so I let him listen and trouble himself
\vith the code of the Russian secret
service.
. I was not mistaken in Oranoff's mov
ing quickly. It was after midnight
when he returned; and with him came
M. Grouchy and : ; Admiral. Holstrem
and a body of marines who had r accom
panied ; the~ admiral in his fast ride
from Tsi. . ...
j When all were In the room Grouchy
stepped quickly to- the bed, and pro
ducing a dispatch, held it up to the
light and read: â¢
i Colonel Ivan Oranoff. â For treachery
to your, country k and your Emperor I ex
ile you for life to the Kranstoff m\pes in
Siberia, and God have mercy on\your
traitorous soul.

* Though just as a -decree from
heaven, yet I ached with pity for: the
brave devil caught in the death-maw
of his own trap. He was not defiant
>now. For awhile he seemed unable to
grasp the meaning of it. But when he
did, he only turned on his pillows and
hid his face. * â¢ ;
Before morning he was taken by the
marines arid Cossacks to Tsi, looking
for all the world like Ivan Oranoff. He
had avoided a hundred traps set by
others and fallen heavily ' into one set
by himself. He had no redress; for the
Indian j Menin had ] disappeared . forever
from human sight and knowledge and
recollection in that Quelpartien hut
from which "Colonel Orahoff" emerged!
I went over and found the brandy
and soda and as I drank leisurely I
looked through the room. "What a
pretty picture," I mused, "at Jhe end
of the play!' â Oranoft, two. heavy
armed gendarmes, and the handcuffed
Menin! Though Menin was surely
thinking of Oranoff, his eyes followed
me. What would he have given to have
had. the "fly" once in his hands!
At last Oranoff came swiftly into the
center of the room.
"Martyn, I will give you ,an hour,"
he said, looking at his watch, "to re
store to 'Colonel Oranoff' everything he
wore when he wan brought here. Dress
him as 'Colonel Oranoff' and call him
by that name."
I was dumfounded, and as Dulclne's
father left the room a new light came
into Menin's face. For once, perhaps,
Menin's eyes. were on me as I. spoke,
and the old leer was in them;, now and
then he spoke as to himself. ' I feltâ
and it made my blood bollâ that , hie
hated me mast because I was young
and ignorant and chosen for, a part
which I graced poorly,. and not be
cause I. had balked him. "But you are
a weak "actor," his eyes continually
said. , . Â¦ ; Â¦
"As I was at 'the sarcophagus to open
it, this man, dressed as Colonel Oran
off, called me away. â¢ Mad- with fear r at
the words he spoke, I followed < him,"
here Menin laughed and I ground my
teetn, "and in the dark, beyond the
arm.y, I was struck down from behind
and taken into the mountains lashed to
a pony's back. This man . returned,
opened the sarcophagus, and . released
the prisoner, intending to take her cap
tive and hold her until I would go to
the King and tell- him the truth. But
DejnefE came up at. that moment, "".and
he turned her over to him." . %l
Here Oranoff moved for the first time.
With a sigh he turned and threw his
fa'ce into the other hand.
"This man then came to meet me in
the mountains and said he had brought
the prisoner from the sarcophagus to
a yacht which he showed me was an
chored near us, and promised faith
fully to make way with her If I did not
go to the King in the presence I of two
of his men and tell him that the"
Queen's body had been destroyed on
Lynx Island. I escaped - the ' guards;
came to Keinning and found this man
had been attacked by a Quelpartieh
mob while again impersonating you. in
Keinning, and had been Â» rescued by
Dejneff and brought here as Colonel
Oranoff."
The room â¢ was very still when I
ceased speaking, and It was Menin who
broke the silence.
"The fly caught the spider," he saidj
looking now at pranoff. My nerves
had been put on edge to tell" the story
I had just completed, and the man had
angered me steadily throughout its re
cital. The sting of these words drove
me mad, and with an oath I lunged
forward toward "the bed. The nearest
Cossack blocked the way -and pushed
me b'ack. In a moment I had myself
under control and I begged Oranoff 's
pardon.
Colonel Oranoff had arisen and was
standing now at the mantel, his fingers
in his hair, his eyes upon trie coals in
the grate beneath. I knew he . was
coming to some definite conclusion 'with
regard to Menin. How would he deal;
I wondered, with the man who had fol
lowed him closely half around the
world?
cidept which gave .us our first warning,
then 'of the destruction of the temple.
Oranoff sat down and listened with his
head in his hand. ;
"I reached Keinning: too late," I went
on, holding myself sternly to the bitter
truth, "to tell the King that the Queen
had been destroyed, and I found a
woman who: would play the Queen's
part. I promised to release her from
the sarcophagus in the temple of the
tomb."
We met Colonel Oranoft at Chefu,
and Admiral Holstrem's private launch
took us merrily over the eighty blue
miles to Port Arthurâ the prize we had
won!
That afternoon we were on deck
when Colonel Oranoff suddenly pointed
to the blue vaves with a significant
gesture. â¢
"Blue water," he said, "how much
that means to us!"
"How, Colonel Oranoff?" I arked.
Then he drew from his pocket the
large card upon one side of which was
written the menu of the luncheon to
which we had done ample justice. He
turned it over, and on the reverse side
was a map of the Yellow Sea. He
turned this cornerwise - and folded it,
striking the crease across from Shang
hai to Tsi (Chemulpo). Then he held
this up before us all and pointed to the
outline of the Yellow Sea.
It was the very image of a camel!
The head was the Gulf of Liaotung;
the neck the Straits of Pechlll, the
back and breast the body of the Yel
low Sea. ,
"You see the camel's head?"' he asked
quietly.
It was exceedingly plain.
"The great rivers of China and
Korea" (Quelr-irte), he went on,
"empty into the Yellow Sea the sands
which give it its color. We are now
running Into the blue waters of the
Straits of Pechili â and here at the
camel's gullet stands Port Arthur, the
Gibraltar of the Yellow Sea over
which to-day the flag with the Em
peror's eagles was flung at sun
rise. Japan's exceptions to our
lease of this port were removed upon
our promise to throw down the protec
torate established lately over Quel
parte. Russia now Is on the Pacific"
here the voice strengthened, "at an ice
free port; at the camel's gullet she will
hold by the throat all the commerce
was rough, but I pushed the horses on;
and when noon came we ate our lunch
on the summit of one of the gigantic
boulders that stood beside the path.
Then I gave Pak explicit directions,
and we watched him go away up the
mountain; by midnight he had returned
to Keinning, bringing Nsase with him,
and leaving a goodly reward with the
old woman who had taught the girl
that dance that saved my life. Nsase
could not express her delight at being
brought to us, and Dulcine has found
in her a serving maid as faithful as
she is interesting. _ , .-'-:
On the day following I took M.
Grouchy to the house of Kim Ling; the
lad had slept almost continuously since
the night I had forced him ttr say that
the Queen was yet alive. He happened
to be waking as we came, and when I
knelt down beside him ne smiled fee
bly. I had had Pak take the doctor to
him at the first moment I had been
able to' order it; as I knelt, Kim
reached and took my hand. M.
Grouchy arranged at once with Kim's
mother to have him come to the Rus
sian Legation when he had recovered,
where a quiet but lucrative position
would be made for him. Another
watches now, in Kim's stead, that
golden sarcophagus in the mausoleum
â one whose hair. I trust, will never
turn as white as poor Kim's did, one
who will never see the Queen's soul
rampant again in those cold corridors
as have the tongueless men in black,
who not. at all envy him his appoint
ment!
Dejneff had kept his word and wore
his long "shave" no more. . I. cannot
sayâ for lam learning now to tell the
truth once more â that it has improved
his voice, but I can say that Tt has im
proved his appearance. I thought of
this on our Journey to Tsi that bright
day when we bade good-by to old Kein
ning. In a fresh uniform and on a
spirited horse, a six months' leave of
absence in his pocket, he looked the
brave young cavalier Dulcine affirmed.

BY the Good Salnte Anne," Anna
ChapJn Ray's latest story, is
, a charming novel for the sum
mer girl who is Intent on
whiling a'way pleasant hours In a cozy
hammock. It begins with enough
brightness and sparkle to attract and
hold immediate attention and to regard
an Interruption In the light of an un
warranted intrusion. Petulant Nancy
Howard is a vivacious, fun-loving
Amerloftn girl, who arrived In Salnte
Anne de Beaupre just in time to wit
ness a sacred pilgrimage, and In the
spirit of absolute boredom she promised
50 cents to the good saint if she would
perform a miracle, so that a lltile* va
riety might be ad.ded to her quiet ex
istence. For Nancy, be It known, had'
accompanied her father to Canada in
search of historical records. Now, it so
chanced that Cecil ' Barth, a young
Englishman just -arrived in Canada,
saw the pilgrimage advertised, â¢ and
more for the reason that time was
hanging heavily upqn his hands than
anything else went the way of the
pious worshipers. In the dense crowd
he dropped his glasses, and in endeav
oring to recover them lost his balance
and rolled down the steps into the
street, landing: at the feet of the ex
pectant Nancy. The saint. In a propi
tious mood, had answered her prayer
in a most unexpected manner. Barth
spoke but Paris French and Nancy
none at all, so the two might as well
have been on a desert island so far as
making the crowd understand was con
cerned.
Finally, in sheer desperation, she had
Barth, sprained ankle and all, carried
to her father, who was a doctor of note,
and then followed a series of compli
cations. An epidemic In . Quebec made
it impossible to secure the services of
a nurse, and warm-hearted Nancy vol
unteered to take the place of one and
help her father out of an emergency.
One amusing incident followed quickly
upon the heels of another, driving first
the nurse and then the patient to the
verge of dlstraqtlon. Meeting again in
Quebec in a social way, Barth failed to
recognize Miss Howard, much to her
indignation, for she' did not' realize that
he was too near-sighted to see beyond
Â¦ his own -nose without his precious
glasses. However, two months of per
sistent I-will-have-you-whether-or-no
decided Ntfncy 4 that the best r way to
get rid of Bajth would-be:, to annex
him, and whe*n he asked her. if she
could find it in her heart to care for
him . answered . him with ' his fown char
acteristic* reply, "Ob,~ rather!" *

unfortunately restricted by â¢ the exi
gencies of 6pace~-of Mqody's book in
the order of its arrangement, it is not
without profit tt> note'flrst tl;e attitude
tf the author himself toward this new
and. strange creature of finance. In
his Introduction and in the closing
chapter Moody, hesitates not to declare
the trust system to be in the main a
great benefit to. trade and a strong
spur to greatly increased production in
every line of activity. Instead of being
a freak growth upon the accepted
ethics of- trade, Moody declares that
"the modern trust is the natural out
come- or evolution of sbcietary condi
tions and ethical standards which are
recognized and established among men
to-day as being necessary elements in
the development of civilization." Again
he pays, "The natural law which engen
ders monopoly is fundamental * â¢ â¢
for man, in seeking Xo accomplish his
purposes quickly, simply and cheaply,
has ever been alert to the possibilities
of economy in method through the^
seeking of 'short cuts." Â¦ â¢ â¢ â¢ By
combining together and â¢ acquiring,
either as a result oT this ]oint effort
or otherwise,- a ajteciul privilege or
'monopoly.' men found that they could
accomplish the same errds far more
cheaply aHd satisfactorily than in the
c-ld way, and do so without the- same
exposure tp what was 'frequently ex
pensive and costly in the field of coni
petiUon." . Onye again, Moody has this
to -say:' "Monopoly value is one of the
chief essentials to business success un
de"r modern social customs, and with
out it Industjia-l society of. the present
day. could not be conducted as it is."
The "writer Is, then, of Wall street.
Believing that 'the destruction of com
petition by the elevation- of the trust
system is nothing but the natural
"short cut" to Increased activity in
production,' Moody avers that the hin
dering of the concentration of trade re
sources In the. hands of the few makes
for an unhealthy socialism in the" eco
nomic atmosphere, in that it is the as
sumption by the State of the right to
control private initiative. "For when
we realize what monopoly is,. its depth
and width and general importance in
modern Industrial and commercial life,
we can readily gee that any kind of
leeiÂ»latlon aiming to abolish or mate-.
rially retrench monopoly would have to
be : far- reaching and radical in its ef
fects and would constitute a practical
revolution in the bases of modern soci
ety." This is the laissez falre of the old
physiocrats with a vengeance.
With such assertions concerning
abortive; restrictions -of. monopoly :
Moody must needs fortify- him
self with, a very broad defi
nition of that term. "When . men form
corporate Â¦ organizations," says Moody,
"they do ; not form monopolies. They -
may take advantage of monopoly In one
wa*- or another, but they do not create
it: The monopoly Itself is rather a so
cial product, which exists with the con- â¢
sent of society, and' men' in :
take advantage of it where 'found, Just
as they take, advantage of ifanyi other '
factors *â¢ for the purpose of achieving ;
.their ends. â¢ â¢ * In the ; absorption
of a source' of supply is the 'securing of )
a: monopoly. . Society,;; recognizes i the : ;
rlght;6f man to this exclusion aridjthis }
is the only reason why It exists." â¢' Â¦ The -
author goes on to; develop this â¢ state
ment by defining patents and tariffs as '
for the pure fun of the playing. .It is
the author's task' to analyze the re
markably contradictory character of
this high spirited girl, to ' trace the
clash between her sordid and degrad
ing surroundings and- her inherently
pure and exalted spirit. It is a study
in. the power of heredity* and environ
ment upon the molding of character,
very convincing.
Fan Is far from being a lovable
.character. Her- assumption : of the
bravado in tie matter of what the
gossips are led to believe Is sometimes
a bit forced, her contrariness has car
ried her into a pseudo cynicism and
an ungraceful, irreligious frame of
mind, -which is preculiarly grating.
Despite all her mental anguish at the
inevitable visitation of nemesis upon
her the reader gives of his sympathy
grudgingly. Mrs. Sales, she of the
lavender perfume and the whisky
punch, is drawn with as fine a lead as
Fan. The young newspaper man, who
is temporarily infatuated with Fan, is
scarce!*' mare robust 'of soul th'an he
â¢is of body; his is not a- wholesome per
sonality. All of the characters, Jn
fact, are unlovely a'nd the book is of
a dun-colored tone, albeit ppwerful.
This is too. often the price paid to
realism. Beauty and idealism cannpt
be painted. into a photographic study
of life such'as is "The Price uf Youth."

Exhaustive Work \
Upon the Trusts
governmentally conferred or artificial
monopolies and rights of way of trans
portation companies coal and iron sites,
etc., as socially r;eated or natural mo
nopolies. Monopoly . is then, according
to Moody, an extant condition utilized,
but not calied into being, by the cor
porate organization. Hte view is not
sufficiently. elucidated to-be convincing.
â¢The author.'s chapters ' upon the
greater industrial trusts,, comprising
part 1 of the . volume, are, from the
nature of the subject, free from the
injection of his own theories and con
stitute the. most valuable dower of
the work. With the combinations of
corporations that have the common
surnameâ Trust â and are designated
by the generic denominations "cop
per," "sugar," "tobacco," "shipping,"
"Standard oil," "steel" .and "the
smelters'," the author deals in such
minute detail as to put anything but a
very general remark concerning this
part of the book beyond the province"
of this review. In the cas* of each'
trust there is given, first: the history
of its inception; then a review of its
financial growth with complete tables
of dividends declared, stocks floated
and corporations amalgamated with
it; an analysis of Its growth, influeh.ee
and methods of business closes the
discussion. In each instance there Is
appended to the text such complete
tables of statistics and charts and dia
grams so carefully prepared that the
worth .of this review for ready" ref
erence is raised to a maximum. The
chapter devoted to the steel trust and
a subsequent discussion of- the ship
building trust, both comprehensive
pamphlets in themselves, have' an
especial timeliness anent the re'eent
scandals involving those two organiza
tions. In the matter of profit-sharing
instituted in several mills controlled
by the steel trust, Moody takes- oc
casion to declare that such an'experi-s
ntent is "ill-digested and unsound, in
principle *and has acted as an injury
instead of a benefit."
The consideration of the great rail
road groups again . brings out, the
author's theories of freedom of action.
The "communities of interest" or rail
road rings control nearly 95' per cent
of the vital railroad mileage in the
country â a perfectly normal result of
a 'normal* tendency, according to
Moody. "Every attempt, 'legnl or
otherwise, made with a view to cur
tailing or eliminating this element of
monopoly in railroads is a sheer waste
of effort and of capital and tends to
do more harm than good to both the
companies themselves and the public
who make use of them." In the light
of this statement *Mr. Moody must take
exception to the recent ruling of the
United States Supreme Court in the.
matter of the Northern ( Securities
merger.
-Viewed in its entirety, "The Truth'
About the Trusts," even though frankly
partisan in the spirit of its deductions,
must from Its exhaustive compendium
of statistics and its outlay, of facts be
considered nearer the whole truth on
that aggravated crux in present day
economics than any work yet pro
duced.

Verhoyansk, the next settlement to
be reached* and the last picket of-civ
ilization that looks out to the mystery
of the wilderness beyond, affords th<?
author a chapter upon the unthinkable
'terror of Russian penal servitude in
such, a place as this. Owing to his re
. ply made some years ago to Mr. Georg'e
Kennan'^ â¢ exploitation of the Czar's
treatment "of political prisoners, th.e
auth'or had felt up to this point that
he must see only the goad in the sys
tem,; but" the terrible condition of af
fairs -he discovered at Verhoyansk
shook even the optimism of De Windt
â¢and he reveals in this chapter upon the
northernmost of Ruj-da's penal colo
nies horrors which must wither the
stoniest heart. In this place as in
Sredni-Kolymsk, a second prison town,
which De Windt visited later, there are
.needed no guards nor fetters to keep
the convicts .under duress; the snow
In winter and the swamps in the warm
er weather are guards enough. The
unfortunate "politicals" are allowe.1
only enough of the bare necessities of
life to keep body and soul one, their
quarters are open to the elements and
filthy with long continued usage. What
is far worse, though, Is that the hap
less wretches have nothing to do, are
not allowed to indulge in manual labor
to "any considerable extent, and are
'consequently left a prey to their own
fretful, minds and the awful monotony
of the white snow ur gray sedge. In
sanity sometimes comes to them in less
thah a year and the insane are al
lowed, to live side by side with the
saneâ a .dreary 'bedlam worse than
death. All these prisoners, the normal
and* the maniacs, are under the rule of
one man, who, be he a. despot, may
make his whims a'nd huffs felt .by each
of "the unfortunates. "An Arctic In
ferno" De WIridt well styles such a
place as this. . .
From-Sredni-Kolymsk the party, un
der the guidance of a treacherous na
tive, struck -out boldly into the no
man's land along {he Arctic Sea. The
narrative from this point is one of in
tense interest. Loss of food brought
privation; the death of sledge dogs de
layed their progress painfully; the fury
of the north storms and the treachery
of the ice threatened them all with
sudden death more than once. After
great suffering the four Europeans and
their native helpers arrived' ' at a
Tchuktchis 'village on the east side of
Bering Straits and there awaited the
arrival of the United States revenue
cutter Thetis, which conveyed- them
across to the 'Alaskan shore. The re
mainder of the journoy, up the Yukon
River to Dawfdn and over the White
Pass Railroad, thence down the coast
to. Seattle' jand on to San Francisco and
"New Y<jrk, was made without accident.
Aft^r.all, the 'bEfensiblp object of
De WIndt's trip was as far from* fulfill
ment at the end as at itÂ£ inception, for
what can a journalist ' and explorer
judge of railroad problems? .We -says
a railroad might be laid, but not over
the route he traveled. That is neither
here nor there, 'however; an engineer
will have to be the Judge of that ques
tion. But what De Windt really set out
to do he has done: to make a record
of exploration that is of fascinating in
terest when put into a book.

Russian writers and speakers on dif

The object of the book la to enlist
sympathy and charitable assistance
for the Jews. Although this -work
contains a large number of Interesting
facts regarding many questions per
taining to the Russian and Interna

the writer is able to make out only a
feeble case for the Russian Jew. â¢
Singer's strong pro-Jewish bias Is
evident, even in his preface, and it at
once arouses suspicion as to the ac
curacy of his statements. This sus
picion increases considerably -while
noticing his strong " laliorinff after
dramatic effects In the first chapter,
wherein he describes the massacre.
How systematically" and willfully the
Russian Government and people are
maligned is clearly lsarned by perus
ing the extracts in Chapter V from
the splendid speeches and writings of/

occasions they have been called upon
to refer to- instances of Jew-baiting
in the districts of Kherson and
Odessa. The speeches of the priests.
Jelenewski, Podgorski and Demetrius-,
in particular, plainly show . that the
educated classes in Russia are as hu
mane and tolerant as Americans, and ,
that no one more sincerely deplored I
the riotous excesses of the drunken
rabble who attained notoriety by
their Jew-baiting tragedies. Singer's
book shows how easily the misdeed3

can, under suitable circumstances*, tar

Impossible for the man with a pur

to well-nigh girdle the earth with only
forty odd miles of water crossed,
volla â it Is done, and the material. for
a lively book is not the least important
by-product of the feat accomplished.
The seasoned globe-trotter, who had
already gone overland from Peking to
Paris, who had exploited India 'down
to its innermost recesses and knew Si
beria better than many of the Czar's
Governors, needed very little excuse to
start; him oft* on this, the most am
bitious and most hazardous of any of
his fijttlngs. The somewhat "yellow"
newspaper agitation of a few years
ago about the feasibility of a great
Â¦world railroad, connecting Europe
with America, via Siberia, permitted
De Windt to offer himself to the man
agers of three newspapers in London,
Paris and New York as the pioneer
for this project who should go over
the route proposed and report upon its
practicability or otherwise. So upon
this rather chauvinistic basis of jour
nalistic enterprise De Windt left Paris
on December 19, 1901, to essay a feat
never yet undertaken â that of keep
ing foot to land all the way from
Paris to New Tork, with the excep
tion of the jump across Bering Straits.
That he did It in less than a year Is
a matter of record, but how he did it,
as elucidated in this intensely interests
ing work of his, is a question of much
more significance.
Odd as It may appear to the reader
at first thought, De Windt's choice of
the dead winter for crossing the bleak
eteppes cf Northeastern Siberia was,
es he has cause to demonstrate in- the
course of his narrative, the only feas
ible measure. The whole of Siberia
within the frozen circle is in summer
time an impassable morass of river
OTerflow, lowland and swamp, that
renders communication even with
tome of the Siberian outposts on the
Upper Lena absolutely impossible; but
In th* dark winter months, when all
the bleak land about the Arctic is
frozen harder than adamant, sleds
carry over thesa hidden bogs with
safety fir. 4 swiftness. So it was that
De Windt and his companions left
Moscow for the long journey on the
Trans-Siberian Railroad- to Irkutsk at
Chrtstmastide. Not quite 4000 Eng
lish miles were covered on this road,'
which the author cannot recommend
ea a very engaging route for a vaca
tion party. So .monotonous .became
the thud-thud of the wheels, day In
and day out, that De Windt's party
took no reckoning of night or day and
actually made their luncheon at
breakfast time.
At Irkutsk, "the Paris of Sib'erla."
the party endured a wearisome delay,
made even more depressing by hotel
accommodations that were "inferior to
those cf a fifth-rate gargotte," and
then they embarked in Yakute sleighs
upon the great Lena postroad leading
away up to the north, where lay the
final outposts of civilization and the
wilderness of snow beyond. Before
privations began to pinch, and while
their only Inconveniences were those
offered by squalid posthouses, the De
"VVindt party were privileged to enjoy
all the beauties of a Siberian winter.
The author breaks his account, of
versts covered and horses changed
with some very vivid pictures of the
unbroken drifts stretching league upon
Kague, the kirmess trimmings given to
the trees by the network of frost and
the glory of the open heavens at night.
Not the least interesting fact that this
stage of the Journey developed wa3
that the time-honored Russian wolf,
banded In ravaging packs to the utter
terror of the moujik. is, despite the
thrilling picture we have all., seen, a
myth of the past.
Yakutsk, the . terminal of the post
road, De Windt pictures as the most
dismal habitation of man. "Even Si
berians call this the end of the world.
The very name of the .place suggests
gloom and mystery, for the news that
niters through here at long Intervals
into civilization is generally associated
with tragedy or disaster." Cut on! as
this city Is from the rest of the world,
mewed in for half the year by the
ccean of snow and made a torture spot
during the remaining, months by dust
and insect Hfe. De Windt does .not
.wonder that the drab life therein makes
a society In comparison with which
Kipling's Simla people are saints and
cherubim. The author's sketch of this
place of dole is grim in its suggestion.
THE SAN . FRANCISCO - SUNDAY CALIl
A CHAT ABOUT NEW BOOKS
5T5he Religious Parasite
WE had a little talk the other
day about "grafters of vari
ous kinds, " and held up to
condemnation , persons . who
utilize . their connection with corpora
tions or -i their positions In -the city or
national government * for . selfish ends.
And we widened our thought of graft
ing to Include every one who diverges
from the pathrof strict honesty in cer
tain apparently: trivial matters. It is
an easy, step -from the line, of thought
to a consideration of the religious par
asite. He is' not so bad as a grafter, to
be sure, but either consciously or uncon
sciously he is. taking sustenance, out of
an Institution without making any ad
equate return.- This makes him a par
asite, * "an â¢ animal," as the dictionary
puts It, ."that, lives' during the whole or
part of its existence on some other an
imal." . , V
;We flnd.hlm.withln the. ranks ofthe
church. "He is typified by the man who
said: "I thank God that religion is
free. .. I â¢ nave, been a â¢ Chris t ion forty
years and â¢ It â¢ hasn't cost me ; a cent."
Such a. parasite -attends the. services
regularly, enjoys, the music, profits by
the "preaching, .' enters .into pleasant "so
cial relationships, but .when -the con
trrbution box comes' around he searches
his pocket for his .smallest co'in, or
possibly, for a' button.! He seems to
think that the respbns'ibili.ty for keep
ing the church. edifice open and warm
and well lighted, the minister and the
sexton .' pafd "rests "^entirely ;' upon the
"leading "men."â theT deacons, - wardens
or eldersâ in fact, , upon' any one^ except
himself. . V flBP8HQ|| Â¦ .
But* we find the religious, parasite
outside the church also. He is" not so
much of "a', hypocrite '.as his comrade
within the church, but :he is Just as
much of a parasite. He virtually, says:
"Oh,^; well,' religion Is good enough for
"old "women! "and "children" 'arid '.people
who care for It:. the church is all right
for those who* believe in It. but X can
get just as much good by staying homa
and reading the papers, or by walk
ing in the open air, or by loafing at
the club, or by calling on my friends.**
And yet even a smattering of histor
ical knowledge or a few moments* care
ful reflection on the world as It Is to
day mish t teach this same maa that
he Is a direct beneficiary ot tho Insti
tutions of religion. .
The parasite should not forret that
into these institutions have gonÂ» tha
treasure, the devotion, tnÂ© -very llfÂ»
blood of tha best men and womea
throughout the centuries.
Think of the patient, laborious effort
put forth day after day, year after year,
century after century^ in building thÂ«
cathedrals of Europe. Think of tha
architectural and artistic talent de
voted to their adornment. Think of the
good men and true whom we have
known in remote towns and villages of
this land, who, in storm and sunshine
have harnessed the old horse and driven
weekly over miles of rough roads to
the "meeting house." because they be
lieved with all their hearts in keeping
up the institutions of religion. â¢
Now, is it fair to ignore* all this la
bor and sacrifice, to forget that we live
in a land which philosophers and his
torians tell us has attained Its present
greatness iargely because of the spirit
of faith which dwelt first In the found
ers of the nation, and whinh. led their
descendants, as they traveled west
ward and .ever westward, to plant the
church and the school close together, as
the basal Institutions of each new com
munity? How mean and unworthy
against such a' historic background
shows up the religious parasitism of to
day, whether in the church or out of it.
Away with this torpid, indifferent atti
tude. If religious institutions benefit
us. either directly or Indirectly, let us
riot filch their life away. Let us gtva

he held in his hand. He bit itâ then
swore, monkeyâ fashion. -It was hard.
I reached out and grasped a long, nar
row black tape which hung to the Cor
poral's prize. With a crisp bark he
dropped it,, turned once, to me, then,
shot upward and' outward into the
black shadows of the tropical foliage.
He was gone.
I examined Â¦ the thing I held In my
hand. It was a black waterproof cloth
hat band. Attached to It was a three
cornered piece-, of brass, with cloth
trimmings like a rosette. It looked fa-'
miliar. . I had seen, something similar
before. I tried to remember. Then I
knew. / ; . * â¢-
It took me less than two minutes to
reach the major's quarters, and In an
other I had him up and he was looking
at what the Corporal had given me. On
the black band, in big yellow letters, we
read: "Brigada de Tino."
It is a fine sight to see men respond
to a sudden call to arms at night. I
saw It ten minutes . after . I , had called
the major. The two companies .were
lined 'up on the plaza. No doiibti the
guerrillas in ambush had intended to
wait until moonset before attacking,
but they, must have heard the men turn-,
bling out. A volley canie crashing out
of the jungle beyond the hospital build
ing. Two ol our; men" fell. Then rthe
two companies concentrated their fires
on the ont> spot. _A few feeble spurts of
flame answered â then ' silenceV That
was all there was to the fight. .'
At dawn 'ten "dead ' insurgents were
brought in and tumbled into a ditch-
But five of us from 'the hospital.re

troops, but -we r thought; enough of
Pedro to; do that. . " ' *
'; As .for Pedro's' confederates. , the
Corporal . and ( his * gang, ; never saw
bnejof i them .again. ; ', there came
rumors; from- the ".natives \ that ; the â¢ Cor
poral had been seen in a colony of his
kind; up the mountain, where he would
never trouble' the/ riiajor's'dispatch file
from the. old. man, who by this time
had been lhv.eigted quite a "distance
down the road. "Hearing his wife's
screamsr he turned and came pelting
back to her .assistance,, but no.t , before
the seven : thieves had successfully
made off with all they could carry and
had upset a basket of eggs In the skir
mish. â¢ '...'. 'Â¦'
1 The way those rogues. scurried across
the plaza into the hospital grounds was
surprising, and the last'l .saw of them
they were disappearing over, the gable
of the tile roof to security beyond.
Then I got back to my quarters as soon
as possible, before old Jose could see
me and accuse me of complicity' in the
robbery.
It was one night about aweek after
this that I could not sleep. The air was
humid. Through â¢ the square shells â¢ of <
the blind came a mellow flow. of trop
ical moonlight. I started fo"r the door
to the balcony, thinking the air might
be fresher there. In doing so I passed
Pedro's cot. It was empty. I was a lit
tle surprised, as he. was still quite crip
pled, but expected to find him out on
the balcony.
He was not there, but I soon forgot
Pedro in. the beauty of the moonlit
sceneryâ so brilliant that the birds
chirped' where they roosted. Every leaf
of the big mango tree close by shone
out clear in the yellow light against a
black background of deep shadow. The
whole had a dreamy) somnolent effect
on - me, and I think I drooped over, the
railing, . dozing, ' when suddenly a sharp
â¢cry, awoke me.. V ' :
From far out in the jungle came the
cry again. Then a rustle of leaves, and
on the far side of the mango tree I saw
a - black shoo't up : out of- the
shadow .into the lower, limbs. I- heard
the snapÂ°bf ' twigs, ' the 1 boughs', nearest
me ..shook, ; and â¢ the black * object flew
out and â¢ landed on the } railing .beside

crease his following Jiere. One by
one more monkeys of various sizes
and kinds appeared, alike only in their
one quality of^ being disreputable,
.troublesome .characters. "We thought
when the 'number .reached seven v that
the Corporal would .have, enough re
gard for military rules" to put the limit
there, but they kept on coming until
they numbered' nine. There ~\yere
monkeys everywhere; ,in< the trees out
side, on the fences, in;' the balcony, on
the roof and oiv.the stairwars". iltis
true that only the Corporal himself
and Missouri had the audacity to
make themselves at home in the
wards. The others kept at least a .re
spectful distance, but they were ever
within hearing distance.
The hospital soon -'became knov.-n'all
over Northern Luzon 'as a resort for
outcasts of the mpnkey tribe. When
our chief went down to Vjgan ' for
medical stores, they asked him there
if he hadn't better apply for a license
to ke'ep a thug's drinking resort, which
his hospital establishment .seemed to
be. He couldn't 'convince them that
the Corporal's " crowd was abstejni
ous in the matter of hard drjnks.
They seemed to have the impre3sion .
down there that we all indulged in
nightly carousals and that we men
were not a bit more respectable: than
the. Corporal and his gang. Thius the
rumors grew.as they spread, until; the
reputation of our establishment' suffer
ed considerably.
. Jjet me tell of one of the many in
cidents wherein the Corporal brought
us all into disfavor with the citizens
of San* Ilamon. "and obliged trs
to undergo the indignity of hav-i
ing' our., personal honor* assailed*
It came about through one of the Cor
poral's raids on a local storekeeper..
This was at a time, when I had suffi
ciently recovered to go down into the
plaza sometimes and sit on the big
stone bench by the band stand. It
was. late in the afternoon one day, and
I was sitting there breathing in the
fresh breeze. I had a fine view of the'
hospital gateway and the corridor,
leading into the stairs.
Suddenly,' from a small side en
trance, I saw a figure -appear in the
gateway. It was the Corporal, and he
stood alone, erect, alertly surveying
the plaza before him. 1 Then he ad
vanced cautiously, and behind him ap
peared first a face, then the figure of
Missouri, and after him came Whis
kers and then the Rake, and one by
one the rest followed in single file,
ever alert, .uttering low, conversa
tional grunts. I knew their methods
well enough to realize that they were
about to carry out one of, their many
plots against the public happiness of
San Ramon.
They, advanced across the plaza shel
tered by a row of bushes, passing with
in a few feet of me with an utter dis
regard of my presence that gave me
a painful sense of .complicity. .They
went slowly" along in single file, the .
Corporal leading/until they had crossed
the plaza and were hidden in a "clump
of lilies that stood opposite the
fruity tienda of Jose Ramirez. [ There
they -remained some. time, so quiet that :
I wondered what . their : tactics"" would
be. Now . and then the shaking of a -
lily stalk told me they were still there.
Suddenly two 0* them leaped out, the :
Corporal and Whiskers, and advanced
boldly across the road and made a, dash Â¦
for the tienda. Each', grasped a ripe -
banaha and with loud cries retreated
down the road. Old Jose, attracted by
their noise, rushed out and after them
do wn the road, yelling; in his high fal
setto and shaking a big- stick;"
Meanwhile I had kept an. eye on the
tiger lilies,, and presently; I saw the
seven others of the band emerge -on
all fours and with shrill screams make
a dash for. the fruit stand. . Some grab- ,
bed eggs, 'some bananas and mangoes
and nuts and 1 oranges.' From inside the "
tienda came a woman's 'scream and
Jc-se's oid wife emerged with a^broom,
desperately trying '.to beat off the nia
rauders and shrilly cryine for heln

Well, the. Corporal, nlias the' Limit,
made himself a fixture in the Second
.Division "Hospital of *San ttamon.
There was* no part, of. the premises too
sacred for him in which to introduce .
his pugnacious little personality, with.,
a "familiarity highly obnox'ious .to men -
of" military training. The chief-.sur
: geon and the head steward Issued de
crees beyond number foV his expul- â¢
' sion, but the Corporal, evaded them
, with an Indifference bordering on con
tempt. .He paraded up and down the.
'aisles between tho co\ts of all th$
wards, usually erect, his shoulders
hunched up, his eyes roving about to
all corners on the lookout for-all pos
sible trouble, -.and heralding his ap
proach with" aggr.e53.ve little coughs.
Even the doctor- could not keep him
out of the dispensary, where he found .
him one day apparently, playing mar
bles with Eome -quinine pills. ' Â¦ ','.;':Â¦
We thought at first we' could tame
the Corporal 'and make a general pet â¢
of .him, but. that was a mistake on gur
part. The only one to whose -call
he ever responded was . Pedro, and'
.then he only came if his mood "was
agreeable'. . Not that, he was afraid.
. One of the boys threw some water at
the Corporal one day in a) joking sort
. of way, -but the Corporal; landed on
that mair and didn't leaver him until
he had snatched several handfuls of
hair from a pate .none if>o thickly
corered with hair anyway, y Any of
us could induce the Corporal'to accept
some tempting bit of fruit, from his
hands. , He was never too bashful to
â¢ come up and take it. In fact, if he saw
a man eating some article of food that
particularly appealed to his chronic
appetite, he" did not hesitate to make
. a dash for it and carry it off, and then
Â¦ if the morsel proved deceiving in ap
pearance, he took It as v a personal
grievance against .him whom he had
robbeoVand would hurl.it back at the
offender as a missile. The moral
make-up of the Corporal was the
weakest thing about him.
. One day a big Missouria'n was
Â¦ brought to the hospital. He had been,
wounded in one of the freguent skirm-"
ishes with, the' prowling guerrilla,
bands* up 1" in the mountains. It
chanced that he had had a pet monkey
over in, the barracks, and the head
steward weakly allowed him to bring
the beast along. Perhaps the stew
ard had a sneaking, hope that the new
monkey, ,a big, husky fellow, would
kill the Corporal in combat, or at least
chase him off the premses.
But that was where the head
steward miscalculated. The big mon
key tried hard enough to* oblige the
steward, but when the Corporal got
through with him the building was
tilled with cries of a beaten bully and
loud, broad swear words as they are
sworn in Missouri. There might even
have been a personal . encounter be
tween the big Missourian and the Cor-
poral had the rest of us- not inter
fered. â¢ â¢
The result of that fight was not at
all gratifying. Missouri's monkey rec
ognized one would could lick him and
he truckled to the Corporal ever after
ward. The two became as thick as all
bad characters usually are and com
bined in warfare against public de
cency. Of course the Corporal was al
ways the leading spirit,' but In his new
companion he found an ever willing
accomplice in all his nefarious
schemes against our general peace.
Where those two scamps spent their
nights we never knew. They always
disappeared at dusk 'and only showed
up again with, the dawn' of the next
morning. The natives said they roost
ed in a big bamboo tree that stood in
the plaza, but we never knew one who
could confidently state that he had
seen them there.
One morning when the shell blinds
were opened the two rascals bounced
in, but not alone. They had with
them a third member of their tribe,
a big, black obstreperous ' looking-^ f el-"
low with shaggy white whiskers.
Where he hailed from we never knew,
but we all felt convinced he had been
banished for his misdeeds from some
community of his kind ; up the moun
tain side where the jungle was espe
cially thick, and that he had come
down to join fortunes with the Cor
poral, whom he had evidently recog
nized as a fellow after his own heart.
It was only a week after this that
the Corporal's disreputable Â¦ band was
increased by, another recruit, who
looked every bit as ruffianly, as . the .
Â¦rest. We named him the. Rake, " be
cause he. had the permanent appear
ance of having .been out all the night
before, given him by his - mangy coat '
of fur and one eye, gone. Then. he had
a rolling sort of a gait which suggested
_ a chronic state of inebriety. /

army. ' .- ".;:' , Tl: . â¢.* I J ,*-,â¢".
It was the morning after his arrival; .
he was sleeping quietly on the cot to
tvhich the steward had assigned him.
1'he day was fine and thÂ« shell blinds
were thrown open to let in the fresh
breeze that swept down from the moun
tains, iust strong enough to rustle the
barrÂ»boo tops and banana leaves of the
jungle that crept up almost to the bal
conies. Most of us were awake, listen- .
ing to. the piping of the birds. outside
and the drowsy hum of insects.
Suddenly we were all " startled .by a
sound that did not chime In with the â¢
low murmur of nature outside. It was
a brusque, rasping cough, almost a
bark, but human enough to convi-nce
those who heard it that it voiced the
discontent of eome one with thing's as
they were. We all raised our heads
and looked out to the ledge of the bal
cony outside the windows. That w'as
how we first saw him, and I "can vouch
that he w-as unaccompanied by blue
flame or sulphur smoke.
There he sat. a small, black faced
monkey, his feet clutching the railing,
his small paws holding a huge banana,
bo mellow that he had "squashed most
of it over his face. Evidently it was
the stickiness of the banana which
vexed his soul, for with another of his
hoarse grunts he flung the half rotten
fruit in on our polished mahogany floor,
Â¦where it struck with a soggy squash
and made a nasty brown spot. Next
he wiped his mouth with his hairy
arms, then wiped them and his hands
on a patient's white shirt spread out
to dry on the balcony railing.
Having done this to his apparent sat
isfaction, he sat up again and took
in his surroundings with a quick in
vestigating eye. Then he gave a leap
and landed Inside on top of the bed
post of the first sergeant of Company
C. The sergeant raised an emaciated
hand as a friendly greeting, but the
little imp on the bedpost rudely dis
regarded the advances and leaped on
to- the next bed. where lay the wounded
Filipino boy who had been brought iu
the evening before.
The jar of his landing awakened Pe
dro. The monkey sat on the bedding
before him, and the boy's yellow fea
tures spread out in a sickly smile.
Those who saw the look of recognition
that passed between the two firmly be
lieve they had met before. Pedro al
ways denied any previous acquaintance
with that little bundle of pure cussed
ness and never would own up to the
responsibility of bringing him there,
but the evidence clearly points the
other way.
Anyway, the monkey never could be
got rid of. He stayed and became as
much a part of the establishment as
the head steward himself. Like all
bad characters he was known by \*ari
ous r^mes. The natives in the casu
alty ward named him first. El Cabo,
which means the Corporal, because
he wat> such a peppery little chap, and
was a natural born leader of his kind.
Most of the Yankee boys, whom
wounds or other troubles had made
inmates of the hospital, referred to
him as the Corporal at once as be
ing the literal translation of his native
title in a military sense. Now In

. At the foot of Beverly Hill there Is
a siding â a. long siding, once used' as
a sort of cutoff to ' the upper Zanes
ville yards.' This sidetrack parallels
the main track for half -a mile, and
on this siding Ben, as soon' as he saw
the situation, drew in with his train,
so that It lay beside the passenger train
and left the main line clear- behind.'
It then became his duty to guard the
track to the -rear, where the second
section of. the stock train would soon
be due.
It was pourirg rain and as dark as
a\ pocket. Ks. started his hlnd : end

senger train was backed slowly â so
slowly and so smootMy â uj> over the
switch and p"ast. over- the hill and past,
and so to Turner Junction, and around
by. Oxford to Zanesville.
When the sun rose the earth glowed
In the freshness of .Its June shower
bath. The flier, now many miles front
Beverly Hill, was speeding in toward
Omaha, and' mothers waking their
little ones- in the berths- told them
how close death had passed while
they slept. The little girls did not
quite understand It, though they trieii
very hard, and were grateful to That
Man whom they never saw and whom
they would, never see. But the little
boys â never mind the little boys â
they understood It. to the youngest
urchin on the train, and fifty times
their papas had to tell them how far
Ben ran and how fast to save their
lives.' And one little boy â I wish I
knew his name â went with his papa
to the depot master at Omaha when
the flier stopped and gave him his
toy watch; and asked him please to
give it to That Man who had saved
his' mamma's life by running so far
in the rain, and please to tell him how
much obliged he was â If he would be
so kind. . *
So the little toy watch came to .our
superintendent, and so to me; and I.
sitting at â¢ Cameron's bedside, talking
the - wreck over with Ben, gave it to
him,' and the big fellow looked as
'pleased* as if it had been a . jeweled
chronometer; indeed, that was the
only medal Ben cot.
The truth is we had no gold .medals
to distribute out on the West End in
those days! We gave Ben the best we
had, and that was a tfassehger run.'
But he Is a great fellow among the
railroad -men. And on stormy nights
switchmen tin the. Zanesville yards,
smoking in their shanties, still tell of
that night, that storm, and how Ben
Buckley threw second 77 it the foot
of Beverly Hill. . .'
Ben laughed a little. "I think . I do:
"VVIU there be two sections to-day ?'N 'â¢'Â¦
"They're loadipg "eighteen cars ' of.

with the conviction that in; spite of his
gawklness there was something: to the
boy. That night proved it: >' ' Â¦
. When the flier pulled in from -the
west In the afternoon it carried two
extra sleepers. In all eight Pullmans,
and every one of them loaded to the
ventilators. While the train was chang
ing engines and crews, the excursion
ists swarmed out of , the, hot ears to
â¢ walk up and down the platform. They
were from New York,* *nd had- a band
with them â as -Jolly a cnud as we ever
hauled â and I noticed many boys and
â¢girls" sprinkled among the grown folks.
As the heavy train pulled out the
band played, the women waved hand
kerchiefs and the boys shouted them
selves hoarse â it was- like a holiday,
everybody seemed so happy.. All I
hoped, as I- saw the sm<Â»IÂ»e- of the en
gine turn to dust on the horizon, wp -,
that I could get them over my division
and their lives safely off my hands.
For a week we had had heavy rains,
and the bridges and 'track gave us
\vorry.
Half an hour after the filer -left, 77,
the fast stock freight, wound like a
great snake around the bluff, after It.
Ben Buckley, tall and straight as a.
pine, stood on the caboose.- It was his
first train and he looked as if he felt
it.
In the evening I got reports of heavy
Â¦ rains eaBt of us, and after 77 reported
"out" of Turner Junction and pulled
over the divide 'toward Beverly It was
etorming hard all along the line. By
â¢the time they reached the hill Ben
. had his men out setting brakes-rtough
' work cm that kind of a nightâ but when
the big engine "struck the ! bluff the
heavy trata was well in hand and it
â¢rolled down the long grade as gently as
a curtain.
i Ben was none too careful, for. half
# "wajr down the hlil they exploded tor
pedoes. Through the driving storm the
tall lights of the filer were presently
seen".* As -they -pulled carefully ahead;
Ben made his 'way through the mud
and rain 'to the head end and" found
the passenger train stalled.. Just be?
June was usually a rush month with
us. From the coast we caught the
new crop of Japan teas and the fall
importations of China silks. Califor
nia still scut her fruits,. and Colorado
v.as beginning' cattle shipments. From
Wyoming came sheep and from Ore
gen steers; and all' these not merely
in carloads, but in solid trains. At
times we were swamped. m The over- 1
land traffic alcne was enough to keep
us busy. On top of it came a '.great
movement of grain from Nebraska that
cummer, and,' to crown our trouble's,
a~~rate war Fprang up. Every mah,
woman and thild cast of the Missis
sippi appeared to have but one ob-*
Jet in lifeâ that was to get to Cali
fornia, and to po over our road. The
passenger traffic burdened our re
sources to the last degree.
I was putting on new men every
day then. We ..start them, at brak!
ing on freights.' Usually they work
for years at that before they get a
train. But when a train dispatcher is
short on crews he roust have them,
and can only press the best material,
within reÂ«>cb. Ben Buckley had not
been braking three months when I
called him up one day and asked him
If he wanted a train.
â¢â¢Yes, sir. I'd like one first rate. But
you know I haven't been braking very
long. Mr. Reed." he said frankly.
"How long have you been In tEe
train service?"
I spoke brusquely, though. I knew
without even looking at my service
card Jun how long it was. WJ'lF'i
"Three months, Mr. Reed."
It was right to a day.
â¢ 'I'll probably have to send you out
on 77 this; afternoon." I saw him stiffen
like a ramrod. "You know -we're pret
ty B^iort," I continued.
"Yes. sir."
"But do you know enough to keep
your bead on your shoulders and your
train on - your orders?"-

writing. "L wish Letitia were here *to\
put this advertisement . in proper

with her pen. But I can.'t wajt to ser#^'
this to Newport, and I suppose she
would think my scheme crazy. I have'
decided to 'advertise * In : the County
six, and we worked real hard to get
them," she said.
Miss Deborah was beginning to feel.
Heartily ashamed of herself. "Come
into the dining-rocm and I will make
you some lemonade," she told them.
"After all. a promise is a. promise. I
will take the sir toads. Thirty-eight,"*
she "added under her breath.
The next morning she took another
notice to -the editor, stating that no *
more toads were wanted, but in spite
of this fact toads arrived in rapid suc
cession. Before the week was over-Miss
Deborah found herself the possessor of
sixty of these interesting creatures.
Lucy always took the children's part,
but when the high water mark of sixty
was reached, even Lucy thought it time
to call a halt.
"I've spent three dollars on thosÂ«
confounded toads," Miss Deborah said,
"not to mention the twenty -cents ;for
frogs I didn't kefep: if It goes on much !
longer it will be worse than one of the
plagues. I am scrry Letitla is so dis
turbed. She writes that we are nak
lng ourselves the laughing-stock of Ep
pingham. I suppose Sarah Lutterworth "
has sent her one of her' lively, letters.
It is funny! Of course, it is "funny:. I
can sse myself that there is an axrus
ing side to it, but I don't see why Le
titia should mind when she is neitly
out of it. Who would have supposed
â¢ that " toads were so numerous in Ep
pingham?"
After Miss Deborah's sixty toads had
been cheerfully disporting themselves
In her garden for a few days, John
, Forsyth unexpectedly arrived to spend
a"Bisrht*wlth h!3 aunts on the war to
Join hi3 family at North East Harbcr.
It was delightful to see the dear fel
low, but both'aunts. devoutly hoped, he
would not hear of the toad episode, for
they were beginning to feel sensitive,
and' their nephew bad a sense! of
humor.
"It is so good to see, you." John said,
as they all three sat out on the piazza
after tea. "I was in Newport for a day
or twq last week and I hunted* up Aunt
Letitia. She is at one of the swellest
hotels, and I thought she looked In
first-rate condition, but she seemed a
little hoxnestek."
VLetitla homesick?" Miss Deborah
: asked Incredulously.
::"I fancy beinsr with Miss Macauley
Isn't." all Aunt Letltia'a fancy painted
.â¢it.. She *ald "something enigmatical
: about never knov.inc people, until you
live in the. housi* with them. She said
Miss Macauley v.'as a most 'interesting*
woman, but that she liked her own
way," he added, with a gleam Â°f
amusement in his eyes. "In short, I
think Aunt Letitla will be .quite recon
ciled when her time Is U3#V How well
your hollyhocks and- swset paas and
dahlias are looking, Auat Deborah."
Â¦ "Don't bV satirical. John; the garden
never looked so.' badly. Still, If . you
could have seen 4t/* fortnight a ago,
when we came.:; data 4 from the moun
tains, you* would b4 aniazed at the im

â¢ **Did I see a toad In the garden?"
John asked. ."I Certainly did. There
goes another! And there Is a third one
hopping along! How; odd; There is a
fourth! I never saw so many" tcf ds be
fore." ". ' . . ( ;.i ..>*"'
"The garden Is full of tHenw" said
Miss Deborah. "They eat Insects, so
we are glad to have them."
"I suppose they all happened along
of their 6wh accord?" John Inquired
nonchalantly.
"Quite so," raid, his Aunt Deborah.
"The garden gate was ajar and they
walked in."
"That waS very convenient."
John began to laugh, and so did his
Aunt Deborah.
â¢â¢"1. might have known your Aunt Le
titia would have told you the whols
story," she said.
, "You forgot that Esther takes thÂ«
County News. Just how'many toads
have you in your garden?" he asked
confidentially. . ./ _ .â¢
"Almost precisely the same num
ber as my age, John â just one or two
â¢ more. Novj. you know.lt Isn't'- polite
to ask a. lady her age." '^
"If you have only as many as you
are years old. Aunt Deborah, it is a
\ery small number," he returned gal
lantly,
Â£} "Lucy, isn't it pleasant to be with
some One who' doesn't tell the truth?"
At this point a boy with a pail came
up the pathway. - . . â¢
\i "John, you go and tackle him," said
[ - Miss Deborah.- '"He has toads. Tell
U him I don't want any."
"Miss Wyatt doesn't want to see
â¢ you; you can go home," John. said. Â¦
Th,e boy lingered.
Miss Deborah came down the steps.'
"I don't want any more toads." she
said; "and -what is more, I won't take
any more toads. I have sixty in my"
garden, I can't be expected to buy
'them the rest of my life. Perhaps
1 - Mrs., Lutterwprth. would take them Af
: you." he. added with cheerful malice.
"Tell her Miss Wyatt sent you to her.'!
, "I ain't got no toads'," said the boy
sullenly. "What should I be doing with
. toads? I've got some blackberries Mr.
f .Newhall sent you from the .farm, but
if you don't \Vant 'em, I'll take 'em to
the other lady."
j "We do want them," said Lucy, hur
. rylng down thÂ» steps to get the pall, "it
> was very kind of Mr.-Newhall to send
: them." -
t , John meanwhile had been disgracing
j the family by laughing immoderately
. "I. don't want any toads!" he mimicked
after the boy had departed. "If you
. could only have heard, yourself, as you
t made that, statement, Aunt Deborah."
"Well. John, I.don't believe you would
r want any if you were* in my circum
stances."
"What do you suppose that boy
thought?" he asked her. "What report
â¢ will he give the old man? 'Miss Deborah
1 Wyatt has gone crazy.' will be the very
mildest way he'll. put it. Poor .old
i Peter NewhaU! Ton owe him an ex

And so It was that good came but of
evil and that Mr. Newhall had that In
*Â¦ vitatlon'to dine with .the Wyatts an

"^ One. of .the loveliest shirt waists of
the season *was made, of champagne
"colored mull. It was trimmed with
'ivory white lace and piped .with pearl
white binds. A deep girdle of opal
yellow chiffon velvet confined the
waist.
They say there was never so many
new colors as this year. And. not only
are there many new colors from, which
to j pick", but there are many revived
tones. Among the shades which are
either new or revived are opal yellow,
pansy 'purple, orchid . purple and the
row dark "pink. These tones suggest
a gre"at deal fn the line of harmony.
Then there are the beautiful celery
greens, spinach green, lettuce green
and mignonette green. Of- the four
tints, one can hardly select the coolest
or the cleanest, for green has a curi
ously clean look 1 ! In linens, in duck,
in canvas and in madras It is lovely.
A shade that *is being considerably
exploited . is* rose heliotrope, and all
shades of rose are now brought out in
the popular fabrics.
In the cloth gowns, new pink is pop
ular for calling. And those who pre
fer something a little less startling can
wear gunpowder blue, or chamois
brotvn, smoke blue or mink. These
tones in cloth are very lady-like, as
is golden- brown, the fancy for which
amounts to a color furor.
Gowns are selected with so much care
this season that ' bne" expects to see
them worn without * a ~co8 *: yet the
separate coat was never qulte^as popu
lar. It is worn over shirt waists and
over full suits. ' More separate coats
are made this season than ever, before,
and no -matter what the gown, there
must be a coat that can be slipped over
it. The coat, far from matching. Is of
a contrast Ins color and material.
The separate "coats, whether three

Eton" or postilion" coat., whether Louis

There are women ".whp Insist "upon

The tall, slsnderwoma'n possesses an
enormous advantage over' Jhe short Â¦
woman. She can wear novelty sleeves,
of all kinds without fear <jÂ£ shortening
her stature. The little woman, on the
other hand, must be careful* The baggy
sleeves, falling Just at -her waist line,
will make her seem very shprt, and if
tihe be a little full around" the hips they
will make her positively dumpy. *
The woman who is stout can* wear
tbe sleeves In which all the 'fullness
comes at the back of the arm.. If she
will slit her 'sleeves up the outside seam
and will set in a very wide,, frill of lace
as far. up as the elbow slj,e will have
something very nice. This deep frill set
in the outside seam has many advan
tages besides making the figure slim.
It is a' style that can be adapted to any'

PAIRS (Edith). â Why so many
women believe . that-. midseason : and

not imagine. TruB, a suit or hat
never looks its best at the close of the
season, yet it need" never appear bad
ly if its owner is willing to expend -a
few hours of time and a little money.
Take each suit and look it over crit
ically, brush and beat free from dust,
clean any spots, repair -frayed edges
and replace worn linings and hooks
and eyes that are missing. Then press
thoroughly. Â¦ Street - suits require the
"pressing that 'only a skilled. tailor can.
do." . Fresh lingerie sleeves, new stocks
of the latest mode and a fresh belt or
gicdle. will achieve wonders in bringing
a suit up to date. Discard the shirt

Make them quite simple and they; will

IMPROVING A. WRINKLED SKIN
(M. H. D.).â The too vigo'rous use of
hot water,' soap and the., complexion
brush-" will soon "deprive the skin of
its-na'taral oil and cause it to. look
parched", wrinkled and '.coarse. "While
cleanliness is indispensable to health,
.it must not be o.verdone. Nature has
supplfed the skin, with innumerable
sebaceous glands, which are con-'
stantly throwing off oil to prevent the
very condition of which you complain;
as nature's supply has been impov
erished, you must resort to a -lubri-,
cant to restore the soft texture' of the
skin, v There is a vast difference be
tween hot and warm water for facial
treatment. The latter is essential to
cleanliness, but hot water should only
be used occasiopally, and then only'
when absolutely necessary. It is too
relaxing and roughening in its effects,
and wilt cause the face to "datch" the
powder, no matter how little is* used.
Never neglect to foliow the nightly
face bath with a cold.douch, to which
may be added a few drops of tincture
of -.benzoin to assist In toning up the
.skin.. .Dry the face "on a soft damask
towel,' and in future use the brush

Last Sunday; there" * ap- '
peared. in this .magazine
an article . \mtten by
Archbishop George Mont
gomery, coadjutor of Sari
Francisco, describing the
Catholic plan for the join
ing of church and state in"
the public sthtfols, 'which
created such wide discus-,
sion that the following
commentaries have Jbeen
received from tfifcee prom
inent divines of different
denominations:'' .. â¢- â¢â¢
Is always In every Lutheran, congre
gation some. members' who desire -that
th'eir children should be educated in
church- schools apd under church
auspices; for those persons the parish
schools arc maintained. But it is sim
ply T the- view ot the Individual, the
church has nothing t-o say on* the sub
ject. â¢ Â¦ *' . . â¢
'"No, I da not think it would be wise
fo have any connection between the
parish schools and the State. It would
be impossible to make It appear as any
thing but the support of a religious
Bystem by the State and that we would
avoid. ' If any denomination or class
want special schools they should be
perfectly free to establish them, but
they should be obliged to maintain
them themselves out' of their own
pockets. That Is my view of, the
matter, , but .as I. said before I am
only speaking for myself 'and not for
Â¦the church/ which is only what a con
ference Is competent to do."

â¢fro'fn th'e State* we would be" obliged..
an<). rightly,- to allow the; State to inter
fere.wjth the management of our schools
more or le?.Â«j. It the State helped' to
support' them, it' would have a right
tp direct what books we used, for in
stance.. We b*ve a school connected
wtth Stj Paulu's Church, It has.abPut
seventy '-pupils; and we use, as a matter
of fa.ct K the State textbooks, but we
are free to use any others that we may
see -fit.- We are free "to engage any
teachers that we may choose and to
regulate the school exactly' as we may
.prefer aad as. seems to ' us best. , .'if
we" received State aid that would be
impossible, and I very much fear that
sooner pr' later there would be a con T
flict between church and state over
the -management of th'e schoojs, which
would.De 'deplorable. I think it better
to keep "them entirely separate.
* "The 'Lutheran church does ndt ob
ject \o ttie p'resent public school system,
in fact/irfy own children attend the pub
lic schools fox some part of. their educa
tion. -We have a' large . Sunday school
' class and â¢ believe tha.t the greatest
part . o/ church education should be
done jthere s " Ever/ year .we' have a
large, confirmation class, and. a vast
majority of the class have nevec at
tended the* parochial . school. We .had
some forty fcuplls in. our last coriflcma
. tlon class â¢ and out of "that number 1 1
do not " think to exceed three had at
tended our parochial school. -
" VTe keep up the school because there
who come here to entertain anarchical
ideas, and ' punishes them for en
tertaining them. That may seem ex
treme legislation, but the pon
tinual murders of eminent men made
extreme measures necessary. ChildrWi
must be taught, therefore, that an
archy is wrong; the good of the state
demands that they.be so taught.' But
having taught them the generaf^prin
ciples, of morality, the state must not
go further and teach them any special
doctrines of religion or contribute 'to
such sectarian teachings. This Is a
country of majorities, ahd where ma
jorities rule. . In some countries sys
tems are devised! where, the majority
is represented, and some such schemes
are being discussed in the United
States, but to-day it is a country where
the majority rules, and the minority
must abide by the decision of the ma
jority, or. else leave the â¢ country, or
convert the majority, to its way of
thinking until the .minority becomes a
majority. If. we â¢were, to 'allow the
Roman Catholics, or the Episcopalia'ns,
or the Methodists to control education
the rest -of the . community would ob-
Jeot through fear that its rights would
not be respected and that it would not
be managed as they thought it ought
.to be. If a man desires some more re
ligious system of education than that
offered 'by the state, he should be free
.to t give Â¦ his children any other educa
tion he desires, whether he be an ag
nostic, * a Roman Catholic or a Meth
odist, provided it -does not interfere
with; the well being of the state; but
he should pay for what he desires, and
not ask the" -majority to pay for what
he, the minority,. wants. . .'..-
The Methodist church ; . , has always
' held that -any system of; state aid'to
a minority of the. community in edu-
bias to the 'education which would
savor, of state control by the church.
The Meihodlst cllurch would' favor
some change in the present system by
â¢which a general ethical basis could b*
B . e ,? Ur t d for a '^"er" state education.
All the laws of the state, including
organic and statutory; now rest upon
the Christian claim/ ana there' would
bo no more partiality in such direction
of the schools than In such direction of
the legislative. Judicial and executive
departments of the Government.
catUnal matters .was impracticable and
would only tend to disorder. Natur
ally the Roman Cathollo and Episco
palian churches, which are In Europe
state churches, would like to see the
state * aid their efforts, but I do not
think It could be done fairly and equit
ably unless only the Roman Catholics
were taxed to support Roman Cathollo
schools, the Methodists to support
Methodist schools and so on through
the whole list of denominations and
sects. That, of*" course, would be an
impossible system in a " country like
this with seventy-five or a hundred dif
ferent denominations all . possessing
equal rights. What tax gatherer could
find the. respective creeds and how
about the people who have no. creeds?
It would cause endless trouble and con
flicts, so the only practical way would
seem to be to devise some general ethi
cal and exen plary system, and let the
state maintain schools in which the
general principles of honesty, truthful
ness and morality are taught: then
those who want anything more are free
to go down in .their pockets and estab
lish schools such as they prefer.
I do not think any system of state
inspection or examinations to determine
if the pupils of a given stcturlan school
are -entitled to receive state aid Is prac
tical either. Something more than oc
casional inspection: is needed or an ex
amination. The schools aided and sup
ported by the state should be under its
own jcontrol and supervision at all
times. The state should be responsible
for 'their management- and direction
and should have no divided authority
with ; any one' or other sect In their
management. To entrust the total edu
cation of thechild to sects under somÂ»
state inspection would be to give a
a. Jong list of them, all based on re
ligiem; for religion and morality cannot
be separated*. .It Is useless to talk of
morality without religion.' It Is true,
of course, that some persons endeavor
to maintain that, 'morality is the result
of -human experience, that it is not
connected with Christianity and that it
arises simply from the result of. hu
man observations during the centuries;
but the latest and best philosophy
maintains no .such theory now, and if
any philosophy may presume to do so,
it is in the face of the teachings of
all hlctory. Pagan countries have the
same .human experiences as we have,
yet they lack : the same high moral
standards. England and the United
States are essentially Christian coun
tries. ' ChriÂ«t!nnity has been the key
note of American progress ever since
the Pilgrims landed " and it is the
guiding principle of the republic. The
state,' i therefore, has the right to de
mand that all education should' be es
sentially ethical as good citizenship
must be moral, that the child be
brought up to respect and practice the
virtues without which it is Impossible
that the country should progress and
prosper. It does not matter what, the
parents' faith may be, the Interests of
the state demand that the child should
be taught to observe the general prin
ciples of truth and righteousness ; not
only. for his own good, but. in order to
conserve the welfare of .the community.
Although we have freedom of religion
and freedom of thought in the -United
States, yet we find it ; essential Â¦ to i the
well being of the state to limit- liberty
to llpense and bring, it' within certain
moral limits; .thus .we have legislated to
prohibit anarchists from! coming to this
country, and the law even forbids those

12the cushions in his new office chair
was. to show the board of directors
how they cjÂ»u,ld double the stotkÂ» of
the company and leave the Outsiders
kicking their heels at .the post When
it came to voting. In consequence
â¢f this Napoleonic maneuver Snooks
was able to gather until himself a
large quantity of the stock at an ab
surdly low rate and buy a. house for
his wife with the first installment of
dividends.
All this time .James Henry was
struggling along with one eye on .his
battered old'^copybook aÂ«d the other
on the monthly remembrances from
the butcher "and the baker. There
were a Mrs. James Henry and several
little James Henrys now, and between
the" cares of this world and his anxie
ties for the next James Henry had ac
quired a large bald snot and a stoop
in his shoulders. Ha was now first
bill clerk in the overall house and his
salary was almost as much as Snooks
spent on cab fare and violets in a
week.
This sad story of real life la.not un
folded with a view to shaking the
faith of the young men of this land
in the validity of "the maxims on
which they have been reared. The
maxims are all right -in their place,
but they won't support a family with
out assistance." The trouble with
James Henry, as he was forced to
confess on his deathbed, was that he
had not discovered until it was too
late that while early to bed and early
to rise may make a man healthy,
wealthy and wise, it Is usually some
other man.
(Copyright. 1903. by Albert Britt."V
knew- a game tha*. was wor"th at least
â¢tw.o'of James Henry's. â¢ His first "en
gagement was with "a railroad office,
â¢where he was .paid a 'modest, retiring
sum for checking. up bili3 of lading
and. explaining to indignant shlftpern
why *it v.-asutterry IrTiposslble to de
liver, their shingle nails and- canned
tomatoes" until at least three weeks
had elapsed after the date of ship
ment. He was -so successful In this
line that he was soon advanced to the
office of the general manager, where
he sat at the outer door and told men
with a grim, determined look in their
eyas that the G. M. had le'ft for Flor
ida that very. morning and would be
gone at least three weeks. Meanwhile
he was learning how a railroad can
pay dividends and yet keep out of
3ight of the Interstate Commerce
Commission. This faculty alone
should entitle a man to a place in the
diplomatic service.
In the course of his researches he
constructed a plan for cutting down
the payroll . one-third and gefting
twice as much work out of the slaves
that were left. As a reward for this
evidence of unusual business sagacity
the company doubled his salary and
cut his hours in two. Mr. Snooks had
learned by this time that the most
Important work in the world is the
discovery [ of ways for making other
neople do your work for, you. As a
result of this he was advanced. to. the
post- of general manager when the late
incumbent of that position was called
up higher â to the president's"- chair
and a country place, in Jersey. The
first thing that Snooks did after he
had becoms thoroughly, adjusted to

dustrial'fabric .If. the common' Jeans"
overalls' of commerce were suddenly;
to'pass from our Ken. James Henry,
still believed firmlv that all that was
necessary to rise to the top round of
the ladder of fame .was constant ap-
plication and unfailing industry and
honesty, but he had some doubts
about the. speed with which the act
could be accomplished. There were
so many other men scaling the same
ladder that some one was always
walking over.him and standing on his
head to. reach the next round. â¢;]
About this time a young man with
the unassuming name of Snooks from
James Henry's home' town appeared
ph. the scene"and announced that he
was going fo be a captain of industry,
himself.' .He was of the opinion that
iti.was.an ope.ri game and that he was
just.as free to chip in as the next man
if he had enough to make the ante,
In contradistinction from James Hen-
ry he didn't have any illusions about
the value of hard work as a stepping
stone to fame and fortune.' He knew
that it was right and proper to' be
honest and fafrly industrious, because
otherwise he. was likely to land in, the
Institution for the Suppression of Un-
due Activity with Other People's
Money and his period of, apprentice-
ship to the captain of Industry busi-
ness would c.ome to an. untimely end.
But his idea; was that the good old-
fashioned virtues were not enough ot
themselves to carry a man.more than
a thousand miles away from his native
heath. For this reason,' when he
broke, loose Â¦ from the home ties he
petitioned his father to let him mak'e
a deal with the village butcher fpr trie
fatted calf instead of saving that ani
mal until his triumphant return. He
wasn't making any bets on the exact
"date.of that return,
When he landed In the markets of
trade with the product of his trans
action with the butcher in his inside
pocket he at'ones proceeded to look
up some place where they were willing
to pay'a fancy Â¦ price for a superior
article of gray matter,'with - a small
bank account to back,it. He had read
his copybook, but he had also read
the newspapers, and he thought he
four pages and .for the .moderate price,
of fifteen j cents. . In those -.inspired:.;
ages James Henry learned ; that ex
â¢ perientia. d-oce.t, that .labijr omnia viri*
cit, and that it is : better lo "be. right,
than President, especially when "there is .
small chance of thq -aveFage individual '.
being either to any great extent.
Armed with these sublime maxims'
he ventured forth into the cold, cold â¢
world one bright morning. Of course.
.he 'was going to be rich.. That was a
mere bagatelle; any native .born
American can be rich If he wants to.
The trouble is* that most of us are so
busy making a. living that we haven't
time to make money. By. way of
'starting fair James "Henry connected'
himself with a Job sticking stamps
on "circulars in a patent medicine fac
tory, wbrking twelve hours a d.ay for
:the munificent wage.of $3 50 a week.
It was a humble beginning, but James.
Heiiry'vas assured -by his copybook
that great oaks . from little acorns
grow and. he. decided tp* wait a few
weeks" to discover whether his Job "was
an acorn or a horse chestnut. At the
. end of two years his salary had" been
raised to $4 a week and half che time
he'- was*- let out at 6 o'clock instead.
of .7. ; . . .'. â¢ . â¢â¢ Â¦.
He ateenied- to see some, flaws in his
.original*, scheme about this time: and'
was forced, to, the conclusion- that the
acorn had been frost bitten. Then
"he turned "himself- loose', and rounded,
up another position painting addresses
on* picking cases for a manufacturer
of overall^. .This was ai 'distinct im
provement, as his salary was ad
vanced 60* cents at one fell swoop' and
he was enabled to minister to the.

lira i- fr-ie-jds the mine owner* set3 his
face against the' idea of wh-itd-^abor
for two' reasons. First anU : foreiuost,
it's not nice work; the,' mine ' owner
hates the "thought of hisbelpveil white

not -right that the. noble white .-man
should demean himselt by such work.
Secondly, whitÂ«i labor is top expensive.
If, for digging gold, men had to 'be
paid anything like the same price they
are paid fbr digging coal, -the .mines
conld not be worked. The. .world
would lose . the" gold that the" mine
owner is anxious to be'stow upon it.
Thâ¬ mine owner, following * his own

can't take the gold with him. wher

"You talk. Mrs. Wilkins," I said, "as
if gold were of more value to

"Well, .isn't it 7" demanded Mrs. Wil

"I am inclined to think. Mrs. "Wil

the truth. A friend of # mine 'a. couple
of months ago was very bitter on. tha
subject of Chinese qheap labor. With
â¢his strong denunciation .of the*.Pro
posal one was .bound to concur. It was
founded throughout upon the highest
ideals. A little later there died a
â¢distant relative of his, who left him
20,000 .South African mining shares.
He thinks now that to objecfto : the
importation- .of Chinese is narrow
.minded. illiOoral and. against all" relig
ious teaching. . He ha^- bought an
abridged edition of. Confucius, and tells
me that there is" much that -i3* en-'
â¢ nobling in Chinese mo.rallty.- Indeed,
, I gather from" him that the introduc
tion of the .Chinese into South Affi.ca
Â¦will be -the saving "of that cqunjtry.
The noble Chinee* will afford an ob'-
Ject lesson fo the poor white man, dls
. playing to him the virtues of -sobriety,
thrift and humility. I a.ls6 gather that
It will .be of inestimable benefit tp jthe
noble Chinee himself. The Christian
missionary will, get hold of- him. in*

the higher theology. It appears to *
be one of those rare cases where- every- "

nobody. It is always a pity to let these

IF Prince Pu Lun*. the exalted Chinese aristocrat who is now visiting .
America, could' look upon this picture he would doubtless recognize this
costume and the significance of the disguise at a glance. . It is a re
markable garment, and before it was appropriated among other things
by the soldiers of the allied powers during the last Boxer uprising it was
one of the most carefully guarded and valued treasures in the ' "Forbidden
City," that wonderfully mysterious royal residence whert Prince Lun has "
spent all his life until his present trip to San Francisco, Washington and
SU Louis, which is the farthest he has ever been from hotae. This
ful robe is of cloth of gold,,very Iieavy, very rich and resplendent "and of *
fabulous worth. It was not being worn by.an Oriental potentate when this
picture was made, which is the reason you do not see the face. No Chinese
wouid dare don such a garment and let his identity be known. It is too '
sacred, even after having been 'captured as the spoils of war. However, it .
has, been returned to the "Forbidden City" by the flat of the powers,

Experiments have recently been
made at the-Ixmdpn Hospital with new"
splints which enable a perspn with -a
brpken leg pr thigh tp go. about his
business within a few days .of his acci
dent, s.ays the London Hospital Ga-'
zette. The invention hails from the
Continent, .where it has been in use
for some years. The principle of the
splint is that round the seat of the frac
ture is fastened a hardened leather case,
which fits the leg closely everywhere
and prevents any movement of the
fractured bones. â¢ The weight of the
body is' then - carried by Jointed steel
rods attached to another case fastened
above or below the knee, according to
the place pf the fracture. With this
appliance the patient . is enabled to
walk before the broken bone is joined
and there is none of that after" trouble
with stiff Joints /which comes when a
limb. has been held rigidly for weeks.
Odd Surgery
Infinitely more important . than all
these considerations, is the action of
alcohol on the nervous system. I have
no business, at this moment, with the
recprds of insanity or crime, but it is
worth while to dispel anbther pppular
fallacy as Â£o the influence of alcohol
on the mental processes. .
Numberless* tests have been carried
out with such processes as adding up
a column of figures, ' writing an ac
count of a simple, occurrence, discrim-
Inatjrlg between' colors, and so forth.
And the singular' result, well - estab
lished and confirmed, is that alcohol
delays the rapidity and impairs the
accuracy of these processes .while] , pro
ducing the most convincing- illusipn pf
ease and rapidity. The calculatpr has
a subjective impressipn pf facility
ture can utilize. i Â¦
How does it come about that so
many of us- take alcohol to keep out
the cold? Simply because the nerves
of our sense of- temperature .end in
the skin. ' Be our skin well supplied
with warm blood we say we are
warm, and vice versa. ' Furthermore,
we normally lose heat and keep our
temperature at* .the proper' level by
radiation from the skin. Any drug
that dilates the blood vessels of the
skin .-will, therefore, tend to make us
feel warmer and be colder.

Alcohol contams . no nitrogen. It
therefore can never and .-does never
produce 'tissue.' Its food value de-.
pends exclusively on its pro4uction of
energy, and the- first indisputable fact
is that alcohol can be burned within
the body. It may, therefore, be , a
food, and in fevers it is probably the
most valuable food that can be given
to: a' patient, for in fever one cannot
digest and alcohol needs no digestion.
It is; so'to speak/ a predigested food

It will not do. to argue that' morals
cannot be .taught except by the un
conscious influence of example, which
is of great importance. To know what
is right and wrong is a necessary, con
dition of selecting the right and re
jecting the wrong. Without 'this
knowledge there can be no moral act.
The ideas â¢ of .right and .wrong,- held
by all children ; and by not ; a few
grown people,' are much confused. It
therefore seenjs bur ; highest ; duty' to
see to it that children are given that
information which . will enable them to
recognize the right. Having done this.

them: to: select the : right because itV is

who shows talents may shine brightly.
He of right morals and conduct will

&rea"t intellect rrtay dazzle with -his
brightness, yet spread devastation on
all side's. He of correct morals and
goodness of heart* will give that genial
warmth which co*mforts and blesses
wherever it goes. Moral acts are .not
only the most frequent and most.Im
portant They are also the most diffi
cult to instill. It Is comparatively easy
to teach the- children the fundamental
facts of any subject. It is a far more
difficult undertaking to . train them to
do right because it is right, "and to
avoid the wrong, because <lt. is wrong.

â¢not a mark of honesty, but simply In

Nothing, either, will afford so much
perfection as courtesy. No one can lnÂ«

Manners, : the outward expression of.
courtesy,* are â sometimes called the
"minor, morals";' yet such is their im
portance in" daily .life that we cannot
class, them as .minor, matters. ,
' Parents t should* remember "that good
manners- are.rooted In {courtesy, which .
we 'have seen.ia an essential ; element in
a fine character. So -desirable are goo'd
manners, so pleasing to others, and so
conducive to success,' that those of de
fective and: even thoroughly bad char
acters strive to imitate them in order
to pass among, worthy people -and to
keep a places in society..
Manners are, the bodily expression of.
inbred' delicacy .'or coarseness, good:
breeding or vulgarity, 'truth or deceit.

mind and body, working' harmoniously.

In society, good, manners are the
passports -to . all hearts.' â¢, Brightness
and gracefulness, cheerfulness and
good-will are essential in all social in
tercourse. * The* presence or absence o-f
these qualities depends on whether or
not we obey the rules that the social
code has laid down for our guidance.
Gentle manners bring to 'their "pos
~sess"or. an influence which.", though
quietly oxerted, is. a power for userul
ness in the world. In business " all
transactions are" helped by politeness.
Many" fall in life because their manner
does not make a good impression; be
-cause their curtness and lack" of good
breedmg repel" others. .
Good manners, Jike ' any other, ac
complishment,, arc acquired/ by study,
by observation, by . imitation ;of the
best models, by steady practice. The
fine spirit of courtesy is caught largely
from association with th"ose . whose
.ideals are noble.'
It such inspiration, is lacking in our
environment we can always find it
held before us in the great. works of
literature, the 'storehouse of ideals, and
can strive to .make bur lives arid those
I of our " children, measure . up ,to the
* standards . presented to us. By study
and care defects maybe overcome "and
deficiencies corrected. ..
Happy are those children .whose nat
ural endowment and early training
have, made them courteous In "spirit,
delicate in tact, refined in taste, com
posed in manner, whose behavior is al

deedsrin dally life. add to the pleasure
. of themselves and others.
The bodily graces that mark the ex
ternal manners, and that, of course,
.depend upon practice for their perfec
tion, are beautiful and desirable. Yet
they arc not so Important as the quali
ties of truthfulness, of courage, of self
control, of gentleness, of forbearance,
of kindliness and c-onsideratlo'n for
others. Those w*ho have ' these quali
ties may enter any society unabashed.

His fourteen "years on the desert have

determined to write a book on the Colo*

to take up a residence there, during

there. Carl and I will make our -home,
'and from there wander out on : our

sKetches here presented are. to be .used,
in my book,- but X am glad to let. the
readers of The Sunday Call see- .them
.long in advance of publication, that
. they may know -that the desert of.Caii
. fernia has produced an artist of such
unmistakable genius. At least 409 of
such sketches will grace tha pages of
which I am now. writing, and, in addi
tion I desire to give my readers: a taste
of his color, ability. He will \ paint ten
or a -dozen desert pictures, . .showing
with fidelity the marvelous color ef

This Is what occurred at Florence,; on
the Glla River, where. an iron bridge',
recently, constructed, was left high and
dry on the desert and tneref ore utter
ly useless.. rVÂ»- -~ - ' Â¦
Because of this uncertainty in the
course of the rivers but : few. â¢.bridges
are built in the desert country. When
the water in a stream ls"hlgh travelers
by stage or on horseback camp on t the
banks .and wait for the 'water to run

a. Very few. hours. Sixty miles below
Florence, on the Gila River, the branch
railroad to Phoenix crosses this stream;
which at. this"; point' is constantly shift-:

.road company 'haVVnet. the changes in
the river bed by adding to the bridge,'
so that it is now over a mile' long", and
for a 'great -distance crosses a barren
desert where the l river once /flowed.

Napoleon r in the- year 1800, was First
.Consul of and by the secret
treaty of St. Ildef ori.so â¢ reacqulred from
Spain the. old French territory west of
the Mississippi- The United. States, by
the Revolutionary war, had won sover

Livingston, United States 'Minister to
France, and. James Monroe, afterward
President- of the United States (and
the far-seeing author of the "Monroe
Doctrine"), were commissioned to con

a territory which at the time yielded
no revenue and which It would be em

A RICH INVESTMENT. "
The city of St. Louis alone pays
\ every year to the United States Goy
ernment in internal revenue taxes a far
farg'ef sum than the entire^ T^vlsiana
Territory cost, and this '^reat exposi
tion held in the metropolitan city of the
territory has Involved in its completion
an expenditure nearly four .times as
great as was paid for ; the whole. ..,'
â¢The representatives - of the" United
States did not hesitate . to ; accept .' the
â¢proposition of the First 'Consul. _ The
treaty was ,.,^ned at* Paris, April 30,.
1803. The formal . transfer of 'the terri
tory followed at New Orleans December
â¢20 of the, same year at the old Cabildo
building â the seat of the J lbcar French
Government at the time; 'TheoIdCa

St. Louis in form and fullness as an'
object lesson ; for those .who . need 1 such
tangible association to fix the fact and*
Circumstance of great events. ;,It serves
as the Louisiana State building.
It is a fact that the present greatness
of the United States v would not :' have \
been possible without this ! territory. By
this purchase the extent of our , country
was more than doubled, and after this
the' way was made easier for the many
additional acquisitions ~ - of .>- territory :
which - have ' given ' th^.United * States ' a ,

the distance is nearly two and three
quarter miles.
Â¦ Four great buildings, beginning with
the Liberal Arts and -taking tHe -Pal

more than .a mile. The Government
building is upon a high elevation and
from its loggias and porticos many in

large buildings nearest the Government
building are the Palaces of Liberal
Arts and Mines and Metallurgy: Next
comes the Plaza Orleans and. the Pal

countryâ Philadelphia, Chicago, Omaha
and Btffaloâ was 1319 .acres. At Chi

Expds'kion at Buffalo covered 300 acres,
and the combined exhibit buildings
were containe d in* an area of 13.1

Palace of Transportation at St. Louis.
"The Trans-Mississippi Exposition at
Omaha was built on a 150-acre tract,
and tije exhibit " buildfrigs covered an
area of 9.3 acres.
The beautiful" site, of the exposition
was chosen June 2-V 1901. It is six
miles west of the Mlssjssipgi River at
the western limits of St. Louis and em
braces the west half of m Forest Park
and adjacent laends. No exposition has
.had'a more beautiful site. Its hills an'd

There were no such valuable adjuncts

Wilderness" In Forest Parkâ a stretch

rose out of a j mass of tangled under

adding much to the beauty of the re

The clearing: of the exposition site
was begun in June. 1901. The first

TYPICAL MISSION STRUCTURE, WHICH HOLDS CALIFORNIA'S EXHIBIT.
In the "outside" minlns display Cali
fornia gives a show that will prove one
of the great attractions Â«Â£ the fair. A
ravine runs up from t;iÂ»Â» southwest
corner of the Mines building and In
this there are two quartz mills 'which
will be In full operation, three concen
trators, a slaj generating plant and &
hydraulic giant, which will throw wa
ter 200 feet against a bulkhead.
There is an arch in this display five 1
feet wide and with pillars six feet
square, all composed of indestructible
building material produced in the State
â sandstones, granites, marbles, terra
cotta. glazed brick ana other materials.
There are twenty contributors to this
arch.
Gold and gold ores show in* great
richness in "the California display.
That State .exhibits seventy varieties
of minerals, forty pf which are worked*
commercially. â¢ . * â¢
thousands of visitors to" California's;
mineral display, which is under th&
supervision of Lewia E. Aubury*. Cali
fornia's State Mineralogist. This dis-.
play is the largest of this sort made'
by any State. "It occupies a space 43v
105 feet and the central figure and one
of the most attractive things at the'
fair is contributed by San Diego' Coun
ty. This is a . lapidolite column ar.ii"
grotto, which constitute a dazzling
sight. The column is twenty-one feet
high from the floor, three feet ia dlair.-^
eter.-and.ls surmounted by "a ball vt
crystals five feet in dianreter. ThÂ«_
grotto, on the convex top of which*
the column nests,- is a perfect globe,
nine. feet in diameter, half of It beins
belotv the floor. Through an opening*
visitors can gaze into it and a sight
mÂ«ets their eyes that* they will not soon
forget. It seems as if one were look
ing into a room full of the brightest
gems of. the earth, the grotto b#ing:
Illuminated. The lapidolite used ia
brought from the" mine .at^P'ala.
There Is" -a splendid bl^ax display
from Death Valley "and an adjunct of
this, is .a twenty-mule, team and
wagons, such as were used In: bringing
out this product. This team Is one ot
the features of the grounds, as it
drives *to various points..
â¢ Nevada County, makes her* her -oaly
display at the exposition, but Is one*
that caufes throngs -to linger aad mar
vel. â¢ She* has a $25,000 mineral cabinet
and will soon have on display the
$2500 bunch of nuggets presented . by
that county to President Roosevelt
when he was in California.
Only California' ' Is " Represented
* 'in Agricultural Bnilding of/

There are about forty . varieties of
fish shown in casts on plaques rang
ing . in size from ' the half-pound trout
of the Sierra to a 525-pound black bass
from Catalina. There Is also a display of
files.
There are all kinds cf ornamental and
commercial woods in the display, the
redwood burr and California laurel,
highly polished, being among the hand
somest specimens. There ; are mam
moth pine and redwood planks. One
piece of fir timber Is twenty-two inches
square, and forty-fpur feÂ«t long. There
are slxtJ-^-three varieties of California
cabinet wood exhibited. The total dis
play contains 300 specimens.
Among the logs in the "outside" dis
play, they being- too heavy and bulky
to go inside the building, are some that
would supply lumber eno'ugh to build
a. house. There is one yellow pine log
144 feet long, fifty-two. inches in diam
eter at the butt and forty inches at the
upper cut; one sugar pine log seventy
four lches in diameter,-, cut ajive. and
another sixty Inches -in diameter, also
cut alive, which means cut ii* p!.anks
and then put together again, so the
size of the log win show.
Thomas Up *"h has charge of this
display.
In the southwest portion of this
building is a space 25x25 feet, devoted
to California fish and game. Displays
of game birds and ducks are made by
Los Angeles and by the Sportsman'^
Association of Sacramento. Both are
excellent. â¢ " v .
The great wealth of California's im
mense forests is shown in the For
estry, Fish and Game building. This
Is a display that brings close attention
from the captains of " industry and the
great financiers as well as exclama
tions of delight and admiration from
the 'general visitors. Perhaps nothing
more beautiful was ever sho'wn in pol
ished woods, nothing more surprising
in size of log and board.
The space is backed by planks from
three to 'six feet in width of commer
cial wood. There is Â« facade of .Cali
fornia â¢ redwood showing 'different ex
pressions and beautifully carved. There
is one wide arch and two narrower
ones in 'the facade, which is twenty-'
eight feet long and fifteen feet high_
At one end Is a canopy with a.-deep

Japan, China, Germany, Mexico,
Cuba, and many other nations of both
hemispheres, have' surrounded their
homes at the exposition with gardens
thqt show- the flora of their lands in
their best array.
â¢In the World's Fair greenhouses 30,
000,000 plants were propagated lor the
embellishment of the gardeps. In the
gardens^ surrounding the Agricultural
and ". Horticultural palaces and the.
State and foreign buildings were used
as many plants again. â¢ Add to this the
forty acres of - nursery where were
grown the shrubs and ornamental trees
for the- completion of the landscape,
one "may" have an idea, of the Immen
sity, of the task the World's Fair land
scape architects have accomplished In
turning a wilderness into a garden that
contains flowers and plants from every
known clime.
...'At', this point. It Is well to make some
reference to the ! men who are carry-
Ing out ' this great work. As at Chicago,
there^are here two great governing or
ganizations, the. .United. States Gov
'ernment Commission and the Louisiana
Purchase^ Exposition... Company. The
formerbody (Its members appointed by
the President of "the United States) Is
supervisory.' The -latter has direct
charged of "the organization, building
and maintenance of .the exposition. The
Louisiana Purchase Exposition Compa
nywas' incorporated April 24, , 1901. Its
directors â¢ include fnlnety- three of the
most; successful,' liberal, and broad-
ress and reap the benefits accruing
from their Â¦ enterprise.
The. T States of America and the na
tions of "the world have united in cre
ating landscape effects on the World's
Fair grounds at St. Louis that one
could, not witness elsewhere unless he
traveled ~ the earth over. - "
. ,On the two square miles comprising
the . Louisiana Purchase Exposition
may be seen gardens of the desert and
the marsh, mountain and valley, the
formal f gardening of the city park and
the .natural gardens of the wildwood.
The' quaint little flower of the frigid
north r may r be -.found a short distance
from .the' gorgeous blossom that* rarely
attains perfection elsewhere than be
neath 1 - the .equatorial sun. .
The . landscape artist at the
World's .Fair had thirty-five miles of
roadway r .to; embellish with lawn and
shrub.:, In: the. gardens of the cascades
is;shown .the most pretentious "creation
of formal gardening ever undertaken at
an exposition. Here are great stretches
of -â¢ velvet ';Â¦â¢ lawn between streams of
crystal water, bordered by millions of
gorgeously, colored blooming plants and
! brilliantly; tinted foliage plants. Tow
ering -tpalms^and green bay trees stand
as . sentinels ; at points of vantage and
accentuate, the beauty of the more.gor
geous'but less stately flowers. * .
; In another section Is a rose garden,
ten acres ; in extent â the largest rose
garden*, in the world. The ,75,800 rose
bushes, 'i with th'elr million blossoms,
produce va" beautiful Â¦ bewilderment' of

building on so short a notice Is an
advertisement for her. Her structure is
nearer done than any of theothers and
would be finished now" had not the first
contractor thrown up his contract. The
building is better than' New Xorkls. ' It
will be very handsome and ahowy.whan
completed. Every man who put*a dol
lar into this feature should feel pleased.
The San â¢Francisco building is mod
eled After the central portion, of the
Ferry depot and with Its tower Is a
very fair representation of this unique
structure. It .Is 71 feet. square and Is
alike on all four sides. The building
Itself and the tower are constructed of
staff, rather ornate as to .cornice and at
a soft cream color. The main entrance
is in the center, while the two rear
entrances are In each corner and are
closed by large, specially' designed red
wood doors. The Interior is finished ra
redwood and is designed after the .pop
ular mission type, as Is also the furni
ture, made 'specially for it. The waHs
and partitions are covered with a two
tone brown, burlap which blends wÂ«H
with the wax finished redwood", and
forms a very pleasing background, not
only for Ihe fine art exhibits, but also
for the photographs; maps, charts and
graphic display setting forth the muni
cipal exhibit proper. ;
â¢ IX THE MISSION* STTLE. . .
It was a rather happy' idea tcf' select
the mission type for the Interior finish
ings, because it Is not only the latest
fed In interior" furnishings, but San
Francisco was a mission. before it was
a. city; and this is the only .building" in-'
the Model street historically entitled' tÂ«
use the mission style.
.The evident Intention Has been, to
appeal to two classes of citizens In Ihe
exhibits prepared. The first" is. the man
who wishes to ship to the Orient- from
any point in the United States, aod for
his benefit there will be.' a large relief
map of the peninsula of San Francisco.*
and the surrounding bay. extending
from Benlcla to San -Jose. The map
itself has been well executed" and" Its
color scheme Is calculated to please the
eye 'and. to harmonize with its sur
roundings. The exact position pf.th&."
city with reference to the shipping \C-iU'
be faithfully j represented In' a hemi
sphere, eight feet.- in diameter and
mounted on ball bearings, .so that one
may easily turn it to- Inspect 'transpor
tation lines by land or water. Â¦ "
â¢Some really "fine ijanoramic views .will
be. among the notable photographs d.Is
played. . Two are taken from ' ' Twin
Peaks and give a comprehensive idea
of the city's location, each' picture "be
ing thirty inches wide and nearly ten
feet -long. Another view of e.qual glza.
is taken from Yerba Buena Island, still
another .from Presidio Heights and an
other from -Telegraph Hill. The prin
.cipal buildings will.be made conspicu
ous by bromide' enlargements, and .in
the lecture room" a motion "picture" of
the entire . water front will be' Â£ ' very
attractive feature. . . - ;Â¦ -,
To the. man of- wealth and refinement
there will be much to attract and inter
est. Not only will- there be an excel
lent fine art- exhibit, but also "a fine
showing, of arts and crafts in the vari
ous useful and ornamental articles dis
played. The San Francisco Camera
Club will have a fine exhibit in a booth
near the front entrance; where It will
show a comprehsnsive exhibit, of San-
Francisco views photographed by." Its
most' talented members. ' .*
." . NATIVE IilTERATURE..
Literature, from, the newspaper to
the well-bound book, will be well rep
resented, and there will' be tables, and
.quaint stools- where one may read the
latest doings In San Francisco, examine
some of the" magazine and . newspaper
cartoons or turn the leaves of some of
the best productions of California na
tive witers.
There is a stairway on each side of
the reception room and office In the
center of the building, directly under
neath the tower. â¢ One of these leads
directly to the educational exhibit
space in the gallery. " while ' the othen
will take one into the municipal ex
â¢hlhjt, which will occupy one-hal?Â» of
Â¦the floor and wall space of the upper
gallery. All- of the ceilings will be
paneled with heavy cross beams and
the overhanging gallery win have" caps
and a balustrade of redwood, done' in
the simple mission style. Scattered
about on the lower floor will be glass
cases containing choice exhibits of lace
and embroidery^ also some fine speci
mens of " china painting done 'by the
Sari Francisco Keramic Club. There
wiil be a stein rack, coverefl with
steins and plaques and some large In
dividual pieces exhibited by Individual
members of the club.- On pedestals will
be plaster casts and bronze, statuettes
of some of the notable "statuary In the
park and elsewhere in. the city, with
some portrait busts' of notable people.
.The graphic display will be- made
more attractive by colored lithographs,
maps and charts in color, which, it Is
hoped, will make a very good -showing
for the commercial and Industrial sides
of San 'Francisco's complex life.
' . GATEWAY TO ORIENT.
To emphasize the city's lmportanca
as a shipping center for OrientaJ goods,
as well as. to demonstrate -the .impor
tance of the distribution of Oriental
manufactures fro,m that port.. there wilf.
be a very extensive exhibit of Japanese
and Chinese manufactures,- from the
finest silks to the bronzes and porce
lains, lacquers asd Ivory carvings, sup
plemented by a collective exhibit of
Hawaiian industries and arts. Philip
pine industries and arts and South Sea
Island traffic. Accompanying these
will be. carefully, compiled statistics
showing. the growth of export and im
port trade, together with some data
concerning the Pacific cable already
laid and that in process of Jaying.
The Importance of San Francisco's
coast defenses and some characteristic
exhibits oi photographs will -show the
improvement In progress at the Pre
sidio, Including forestry and roadways
now under the supervision of the mil
itary authorities, also photographs off
Angel Island. Alcatraz and ' the . train
ing station at Yerba Buena Island. The
lighthouse at Point Lobos and the sys
tem of signaling Incoming vessels from
the Farallon Islands and the lightship
will also speak, not only for safety, but
for facilities in commerce generally.

| ST. I LOUIS. April 30.â San Francis
co's Municipal building in the "Model
City". Is rising rapidly. The main
structure is. up and the tower is now
ascending.- A force of carpenters keeps
hammers ringing and on the lower
floor a number of staff workers are
busy making the ornaments for the
structure, j. W. Evans, foreman of the
carpenters, I says the buiding will be
completed about May 15. It is as near
done as any of the others. The exhibit
is about ready and will be here by
that tiriie.v .
Not until one reaches the Fair
grounds can one fully realize the great
importance" of this building .'to : San
Francisco and the lucky inspiration
that . prompted its erection. Perhaps
the ."western metropolis- will never get
another equal chance to show its great
ness and illustrate its future. "When
the Fair management decided to erect
the "Model, City", It sent out invitations
to municipalities to participate. This
invitation came late -and there were

in profusion. Mammoth specimens of

These Jars are placed on four* octagons,

devoted to this department, covering
a total. area of twenty-eight acres.
These are the Palaces of Manufactures

looks uoon a view Inspiring 'in Its
grandeur. Every building Is truly ma
jestic. The richness of architectural
detail has never been equaled in ex
position structures. The landscape has
the finish of a vast garden, with every
feature pleasing to the eye. In the
distance, more than half a mile away,
rises the beautiful Hall of Festivals,
200 feet high, the central jewel of the
beautiful architectural coronet whicn
adorns the broad natural amphitheater
that closes the picture. The sides of
the coronet, stretching In graceful
curves 759 feet each way from the Fes
tival Hall, are fifty-two feet high. They
resemble a colonnade except that
square pylons alternate, with pair's of
columns, forming fourteen sections or
bays, in front of which." upon the ter
race, are fourteen great sculptured fig
ures representing in allegory. the four
teen States and Territories carved from
the Louisiana Purchase. Three great
cascades, the largest artificial creations
of the kind ever made, pour down the
slope from the center and the two
sides. The slope is a' formal garden
richly adorned. with flowers and shrubs,
architectural and ' sculptured devices.
Two beautiful refreshment pavilions of

thousands of visitors who. daily attend
the World's Fair, and moreover, the
rates charged are not exorbitant. St.
Louis now contains 173 hotels, large
and small, in operation . in the city.
The new hotel enterprises recently in
augurated justify the. belief that the
number will reach 250. These hotels
are situated in the down-town district,
in the vicinity of Union Station, in
proximity to World's Fair grounds,
and one is within the World's Fair

both of these. Besides finely prepared
leather, she shows quicksilver, onyx,
cement and mineral water. A fine dis

Perhaps the first fre6h fruit to be
shown in the California section and

FAMOUS BRITISHER, COMPOSER AND BOSTON ARTISTS BERLIN STUDIO.
BERLIN, April 30.â Emperor William
has paid a new compliment to America
and incidentally to American women
and American art. The recipient of the
imperial favor is Emma Cadwallader-
Guild, - the Boston sculptress whose
magnificent bust of President McKinley
has just been acquired by the United
States Government for the new Con
gressional Library. Mrs. Cadwallader- Â¦
Guild has for the past five or six years
had her studio in Germanyâ at Munich,
Dresden, Berlin and other art centers.
A couple of years ago she. decided to
locate permanently in the "Latin Quar
ter" of the German capital, down on
Unlversltatstrasse, which gets its name
from its proximity to the University of
Berlin in Unter den Linden. In order
that her studio might have the inspira
tion of historical" surroundings,' she
sought out a corner of the old and
deserted "Koenlgliche Marstall," or
royal stables, an Immense, spreading,
two-storied structure of yellow stone
and cement, covering an entire block
on Unter den Linden and dating from
the time of Frederick the Great. She
found the crumbling building used for
barn and storage purposes, and musty
with the grime and dust of second
hand commerce. Although her imme
diate neighbors were a blacksmith shop
and a beer saloon, she set about to con
vert about one hundred square feet into
the most artistic studio conceivable.
The old arched walls and celling lent
themselves splendidly- to the. desired
effects, and within a few weeks Mrs..
Cadwallader-Guild found herself amid
surroundings typically . suited to her
work. She had Just begun to feel her- ,
self at homeâ her studio was becoming
the mecca of Berlin's most exclusive art
societyâ when a messenger called and
handed her a forbidding looking official
document, which proved to.be an order
to vacate, to make. room for the new
Prussian Royal Library, which the
Government has decided to build on the
site of the old Marstall. Mrs. Cadwal
lader-Guild was nonplused. She had
orders on hand from Princess Henry of
Prussia; from Herr Studt. Prussian
'Minister of Education; from prominent
Americans and Germans 'and English,
and her plans seemed doomed to"noth
ing short of ruin. She pleaded for a
' "respite." The building commissioners
were obdurate. She was told she must
\go. and go soon. To make the order
imperative the razing of the Marstall
all about her. was begun. Meantime,
with" typical American pluck, she had
.decided ; to go to the highest quarter
forj relief from the rigors of Prussian
discipline. She got her story to .the
'. Kaiser's ears. Within .twenty-four
'hours orders were filven "not to molest

On one occasion an officer of the

a civilian about a woman and the civi

that he was forbidden by the regula

big poster, signed by the civilian, was
stuck on the wall of the Guards' bar
racks, announcing that "Captain
is a coward."
The Duke of Cambridge saw it and
asked what it meant. The facts were

â¢ROME, April 30.â For the last" thirty
years Arrlgo Bolto, the former friend
of Verdi, and composer of "Mephisto
pheles," has .kept all Italy waiting for
anbther. opera; yet, though there still
is little or ho prospect that the work
ever will be finished, Bolto has man-,
aged to retain his hold on public confi
dence in a way that can only be de
scribed as extraordinary. .
The maestro's" "MephistopheleV
which he wrote when a young man,
and which Was such a success that his
name became a household word in two
continents, came as a surprise, for he
previously had done no work in tba
least noticeable. Boito," however,
promptly was announced as the man
of the future, who would rival Verdi,
and the friendship which existed be
tween the two musicians was - much
lauded. Time passed and' there was
complete silence on the part of Boltc, â¢
sq that .his admirers .began to ge.t rest
ive and make inquiries, and then it
was said that he was at work on a
great opera called. "Nero." This, what '
we may safely call "fiction." *as it has
lasted over thirty years, has bÂ«eh kei>t
up ever since. The words "Boito" and
"Nero" have, in fact,, become insepar
able. - ;: *v
The story that he has abstained from
bringing out the "2Â»ero," which, was
quite completed, so as not to embitter
the last years of his friend and patron,
Verdi, by outshining "him. tided Boito
over many years, giving him at the
same time a halo of. abnegation which
was highly applauded. ' " ' <â¢ j&
The great maestro died in 1901. amd
at last Boito was free to show what
the world had lost by hjs silence. The.
libretto of "Nero" was issued iwith a*
great flourish of trumyets; and it was
even said the singers had been selected,
â¢and every one was on the qui vive
when it began to be whispered that the
opera^ needed finishing touches â which
apparently" are still wanting.
Although he is said to work ardently
from 9 a. m." to 12 p. m., tha' following
anecdote will illustrate his methods:
Not long before his. death, Verdi urged
Boito to complete his work, whereupon
the other repljed: "I try to compose,
but who could do so in the awful noise
' of Milan?" Genoa was proposed, but
the noise there also was too distract
ing. Verdi then thought of t"ne villa
Reggio, describing it3- beauties with
such enthusiasm, that the weary Bolto
declared it was just the spot to finish
his "Nero." He soon settled . himself
.in what seemed the Drimeval forest,
â¢completely alone. However. Inspiration
did not come, as the decorations of the
walls of the house disturbed hia artistic
sense, and some time" passed before
they were made to his liking. Then he
was to. get to "work, but he suddenly
discovered that the table w^as not fit
to write upon, /but' that difficulty was
overcome by the owner of | the Â¦ forest
placing all the tables of hls'palaces at
the maestro's disnosal to choose "from.
â¢ -At. last Verdi "thought he Vould pay
Â¦ him a visit and found him atr the ter
â¢ race of the house,- lost in the stupÂ«n
. dous view jof the, sea, sky ' and woods.
"That is inspiration enough for tha
'Nero-,' " Verdi remarked. "AhL" sighed
the composer and .poet,- "it is grand, so
grand that I cannot work for contem
plation of it!" But with all this, Boito,
who has not composed a note worth
anything for over thirty-five 'years, is
the most admired maestro in "Italy.
Schools, styles and tendencies change.
but his "Mephlstopheles" Is ever fresh
and delightful, while* no one makes fun
Â¦of him but a few profane persons who
would laush at anything. After* all.
the man who cati keep the public wait

' "I snail never forget Mr." Collier,"
she said, her brown eyes alight with

never been near the stage before,
knew none of those thingsâ 'right up
per,' "left, center,' and so onâ that act

the usual professional horror of a

That is Mansfield's method, and he's a
genius at it. It's a painful. one. .Those

"Yes, I was,"' MIbs Wycherly 'ac

than what he actually did. Here's an.
instance of what I mean.' Mansfield
had Maude Fealy once in the-com

'him. He asked' her ''to -put out her
hand freely to him in some scene.- ."She

"He must have been a delightful

Richard Hovey, our American Stephen
Philips, wa.s more than I had hopeii
for.
â¢ . "He was several times 'delightful,"
Miss Wycherley put it. "My Hovey
gratitudes are of -various kinds. He
and Mrs. Hovey were almost the first,
to encourage me in my work, and
through them I met what they called
'the gang* â though a little later than
at its full glory. There were still- to
gether a good- . many people worth
knowing, though. And then again one
'was grateful to Hovey for being what
he was. She also is a remarkable .
woman â much older than he was, but
she did the fine' thingsâwhat is difficult
tfor most of us women to do. Hovey, of
course, had plenty -of chance tp make
mo'ney through, the magazines, and
. they .were sometimes. â well,, quite poor. :
But' Mrs; Hovey always 'said,- when
Hovey talked magazine money. 'No-,
Dit-k, we can manage. Do your own
work.' " â¢ . . " â¢
And she managed. And this is how
Richard Hovey,' dead at 33, was en
abled' to enrich- American letters with
i'Thel Birth of Galahad" and "Lance
lot and Gilejievere."
"I phall. never fdrget- my first meet
ing with him;" Miss Wycherley recalled
with a smile. "I was just 17., badly
stage-struck, and a "friend 'took me to
' the Hoveys for me to recite for them.
.i had never recired, by the way.
Â¦ .Then when I got there there was this'
extraordinary black person with the
.extraordinary black; eyes and black
hair. . I was frightened to" death. He
â¢asked me if I knew any of the 'Songs
from Vagabondia.' I didn't. Then he be
gan to recite one for me â the one where
the corpse rattling over the stones be

it was eerie, eerie," and Miss Wycher

â¢ -"Djd Hovey intend his plays for dra

"Oh,. y.es," Miss Wycherley affirmed.
"He'knew the stage, wrote for it.' Hel
used to say laughingly that he wanted

alone.. It rained most of the time." .
"It doesn't do thit in California!"
.'â¢Stjll even, that was amusing,'.' and
the actress laughed her round, Eng

: the best time of the day.- All the rest
had cigarettes and -I. ate condensed

Richard would talk. He would walk
up and down talking single taxâ he
"was an ardent single taxer â or social
ism, or modern poet*. . Bliss Carman
â¢would argue with him â dear Bliss!â
who doesn't know single tax from the
Bide of a house! And Hovey was such
â¢a-' good liar! He told .the most extra
â¢ordlnary storfes with the gravity of a
saint. Bliss was. the weakest possible
romancer. But everything under the
sun,- .1 think, was talked over."
". "Was the poet a good camperâ
Hovey, 1 mean?"
"He made very good coffeeâ lhat's
all The had to do. And he was tre
mendously proud of it. He never- got
up until noon in town, but he would
be over the stove at 8 o'clock in the
morning making that coffee.

his photograph with a look of sheer
reverence, "perhaps the finest thing

This week tho musical .season of 1903
1904 may be said td-jclose for us- with
the two recitals of Marcella Sembrich.
She sings on Thursday evening and
Saturday afternoon at the Alhambra
Theater . the programmes â¢ published
herein last Sunday.
W. J. Henderson said of herâ I get
it, from that useful little sheet the
Musical Reviewâ "When I anv listen
ing, to Marcella Sembrich -singing
Brahms* Melodien* or Schubert's
'Du bist die Ruh' I . think she must
be the greatest singer that ever lived."
One thought that of Schumann-
Heink when listening to her "Frauen
hehe und Leben." and almost every
thing of" hers. One is' likely, happily,
to think the same- of Sembrich when
we get her "Du bist die Ruh," her
"Wohln," her wonderful, wonderful
"Ahfors e lul." In.- the house of "song
; are many mansions.
It Is extraordinary luck, this "of .-ours,
to have had here musicians of the cali
ber of Bauer, Schumann-Helnk' and
now Sembrich, for none i3 greater- than'
these. After Bauer It seemed "there
must be a lowering- of artistic levels,
but, no, Schumann-Heink came.' The
impossible it. appeared -theh- to .equal
the Schumann-Heink achievements,
but comes Sembrich now, greatest in
her school-. The whole "experience has
been vastly refreshing, musically en
nobling. It means a permanent lift, to
local standards. And the financial supr
port given to the concerts of these peo
ple insures us o.ther visitors of- their;
class. . . .
A small courtosy that added greatly
to the enjoyment of the Schumann-
Heink concerts, and that if .is to" be
hoped Mr. Greenbaum can see his way
to repeating for the S -'irich recitals,
is the programme givinsMhe words of
the songs in good translation.-. The
average concert- goer does not. include
the- Italian, German' and French
tongues among his equipment.' . The
usual singer invariably disports'him
self, or herself, in 'all three of .these.
And this must be so. English words
siing to the song written in German,
French or Italian are an unquestioned
abomination. . The accent is out, the
unimportant word is emphasized", the
climacteric word obscured, and the
whole genius of the language lost/. But
a good translatfon should invariably be'
furnished. The singer has a right to
the poetic and dramatic ' illusion lent
by the poem. The listener has* a- right
to anything that furthers his enjoy
ment. Of course the average ectneert
goer is under no' delusion as to the dis
tinctive characters of ta "Wohln" and
a "Der Wanderer." Yet is. the charm
ing mirth of the one; the -charming
melancholy of the other, several thnes
enhanced by a knowledge of . their
wards. Without them, indeed, how is
tfc* usual person to understand ihe full
magic of a great interpretation? of
the .singer's art, its difficulties over
come." its technical marvels â he will
forever know nothing, as, Indeed, these
do not concern him. But given the
word3 of the songs and there Is a new
bond of sympathy between artist and
listener, somewhat whereby he. -may
knowâand the singer kno^y that hÂ©
knowâ the depth and truth of the
singer's reading. And. after all. except
in the firework stuff, this Is the soul of
the song.' . -\ -
. Sembrich brings' with her Rudolf
Ganz". said to be as great an artist as
accompanist as she is as singer. He
wijl also contribute spme solo3 to the
programmes. Altogether, ' therefore,
the week !s to be a -festival.'

MAHON'S OFFER
OF ARBITRATION
NOT ACCEPTED
agreed upon by the men. - President
Mahon also prepared j a statement of
his position and wishes, which was to
be given out in case -the men decided
to strike.
The next question before the execu
tive committee was whether or not
the vote of the union would compel
its members who work on the inde
pendent car lines in the city to quit
their employment in conjunction with
the employes of the United Railroads.
It was finally decided that these men
should be allowed to continue their
runs on the independent lines until
they could be given an opportunity to
meet and take separate action on any
demands they may make.
3IAHOX HOLDS CONFERENCE.
It was after 11 o'clock before the de
liberations of " the executive committee
were ended. Before that time Interna
tional President Mahon had withdrawn,
and after making a statement to the
representatives of the press went to
the Emma Spreckels building, where
he went into conference with other
prominent representatives of â¢ local la
bor unions. Shortly before midnight be
went to the Alhamb'ra Theater and en
tered the meeting of the carmen.
The meeting was secret, according: to
the rules of the "union. From the out
side it appeared that all the scats on
the lower floor were occupied. Some
time before midnight, and before any
proceeding had been commenced, fully
800 men were in the body of the thea
ter. When Mahon entered he -.was re
ceived with a burst of applause. He
stopped to chat with several members
and waited until the meeting had been
called to order before he advanced to
the stage.
He was the first speaker. and he ad
vanced to the front without the for
mality of a useless Introduction. to the
men. He spoke for upwards of half an
hour, urging the justness of their cause
and the failure of the United Railroads
to accord them consideration. He
dwelt at'some length on the actual
value of the street car lines of the city
and the Income It received on what he
said was an inflated value, which had
been created by its employes' and
In which they should be allowed to
share.
Above all, he cautioned the men that
they were making a fight fpr, the
principle of unionism, in the preserva-;
tlon of which not only the street car
men's organization, but evtry form of
organized labor of Ban' Francisco and
the United States was involved. â¢ . ;-
Following Mahon came Richard Cor
nelius, . president of the local union,*
Secretary Bowling and other merrfbers
of the executive committee. A general
discussion followed, , lasting until ~ : 2
o'clock, when the final vote was taken.
, REPLY IS RECEIVED.
The reply of the company! was deliv
ered at the headquarters of the-Car
men's Union at*ll:10 a. m. Previously
a telephone message had been received
from the headquarters - of the United
Railroads that the letter on i Its
way, 1 In .the hands . of *._ a messenger.
President Cornelius "and Secretary
Bowling received T the communication'
and a few minutes later* International |
â¢ Where**, the Mayor of San Ffaa
cisco, Koa. Eugene E. Scbmitz, has
appeared, before Division 205, Axnalga
oiaxed Association of Street Railroad
Drnploj-ea of America, and requested
us in the name, of the peonle of San
Francisco to postpone final action In
the matter of calling a strike against
iSaio United Railroads for three days,
until lie, In the name of tlie people of
the <dty^ 1ms had an opportunity to
intercede with tli c company and use
his best efforts in a settlement of tm
pendlns troubles,; .
And, whereas, this division has not
sought an v trouble In Its relations
with the United Railroads and desires
Â¦ ; ito* concede every Interest not compote
ihle" wlili the vital principles of its or
ganization in order to avoid a strike.
: ';:;.'^eabAJ^d* : ''That' Division 205 does
hereby", agree to postpone final action'
asjr^uestcd by the Mayor In the
iiame jof .the' people of San Francisco,
witfe ilie understanding that the Mayor

: ivilj use :; his best efforts t<5 secure an
a mica Wo and honorable adjustment
,Â«f jiheVcontroTersy between' the divi
sion: and tlie United Railroads.
"It is my candid opinion that the ac
tion of the United Railroads is a pre
concocted scheme to bring on a fight
and if possible wipe Out unionism in
San Francisco. The matter will not
stop with the carmen, but will be car
ried against every form of unionism.
If the carmen accept the terms of the
company in this instance it will be
the entering wedge of the disruption
of unionism in San Francisco. If the
carmen decide to strike the company
will endeavor to break the union any
way and the fight will be bitter.
"There is more involved in this ques
tion than the general public realizes
and all unions should rally to the sup
port of the carmen, for the ' result
means the vitality of every union in
the city.". Â¦.:.- ,
"In the event of. a strike being de
clared the men/ will out;, their
runs to-night, including the "owl cars',"
which turn off at 5 o'clock In.themorn
ing. This action was taken by the ex
ecutive committee In order not to cause
the public any immediate Inconven
ience, v Â¦Â¦Â¦ \ :.
Mahon does not consider his pres
ence here would "be of any value to
the local union and as matters of im
portance require his attention in other
sections of the country, he will lose no
time in getting back to Detroit. Speak
ing of the matter last night,. prior to
the taking of the vote, he said:
"To-night winds up my' work here,
and, as other matters require my at
tention, I will leave the State about
Wednesday, stopping at Sari Jose and
Sacramento. I do not expect to're
turn, as I see no occasion for doing so.
The locals are in good shape and have
their plans mapped out My presence
here would be of no benefit,, hence I
will leave for the national headquar
ters. â¢ :
Still on the streets rumor after rumor
spread of a constantly increasing ele
ment in the union ranks which was op
posed to an actual strike at this time
and it was said they had voted to re
ject the company's terms fjnly because
they had hoped to force the United
Railroads -to accept the '.union's posi
tion. Als6 current 'was the rumor that
r,t the last ditch the prominent labor
leaders in other lines of industries had
informed President Cornelius that in
their opfnion a strike was inadvisable
at the present time/ Cornelius denied
that he had ever received, such Â¦ advice
and none of thelabor men inter vi wed
would corroborative rumor. -V;
Â§ MAHON GOING AWAY.
M. D.MahojT,' president of -.the
Amalgamated -Association/' of Street
and Electric Rail way /Employes, who
has been in the city for some time in
connection with" the 'troubles between
the United Railroads and the -Car
men's Union, will leave the city on
Monday, as he considers his work Jiere
is finished, for the present at least
He will visit San Jose Monday or pos-.
sibly Tuesday and the following day
will go to Sacramento and later to
the national headquarters in Detroit,
Mich".
No accurate forecast of the result of
the early , morning vote could be ar
rived at during the day -and evening.
Almost invariably? the operators on the
ears and the employes who gathered
during the day. and evening at union
headquarters believed that a strike
was inevitable. This -view was further
strengthened by the opinion of the offi
cials of the union and the practical
unanimity of the vote of the men to re
ject the company's terms.
NO LINE ON RESULT.
Mahon was an early riser yesterday.
He spent the greater part" of the morn
ing 1 as a passenger on the various' lines
of the United Railroads. He spoke to
all the operators on the cars upon
which he rode," advising them that it
was Improbable the - company would
agree to thV arbitration offer of the
union. He told them that in no case
should tliey become excited or lose
their heads over the situation. When
they had finished their various runs, he
advised they should go home, and,
above all other things, not to do a sin
gle act or speak a word that would
lead the public or any portion of it to
think that the carmen had precipitated
the trouble. Â¦ .
President Mahon arrived at headquar

ST. PETERSBURG. April 30.â The
reported big Japanese victory on the
Yalu Is pronounced here to be impos
sible, unless the Japanese chose to in
terpret . their practically unimpeded
passage of the river as a great victory.
As the Russians have little more than
observation outposts, with a few guns,
to harass the crossing or the Japan
ese, anything beyond skirmishing is
declared by a member of the general
staff to have been out of the question.
Liaoyang is connected by wire with
the headquarters, of the general com
manding'the outposts and, It is pre
sumed that the commander would re
port Immediately any incident of im
portance. '
[ All news from the front indicates
that the armies of General Kuroki and
General Oku, comprising about 100,000
men, are being rapidly pushed forward
and will be thrown across the Yalu as
speedily, as possible. Japanese trans
ports . have ; appeared at . the j mouth of
the river and supported by a few war

| Japanese seenr to be following
the tactics pursued by them during the

The beginning of serious land fight
ing is considered to be not far distant,
although a heavy movement of troops
may not begin for several days, not-'

believedthat the Japanese anticipated
more resistance oh the Yaiu thaij they

ST. PETERSBURG, May 1. 4:33 a.
m.â A dispatch received here from
Viceroy Alexteff eays:
"The continued presence of the Jap
anese squadron off Vladivostok has
convinced the authorities that Vice
Admiral Togo has taken to heart the
sharp lesson taught him through his
failure to consider the" possibilities of
mischief [ by the formidable Russian
division at that port and is now seek
ing means to stop further raiding oper
ations In the sea of Japan. It is evi
dent that as goon as the Japanese were
informed of the operations of Russian
ships In Korean waters the Govern
ment instructed Vice Admiral Togd to
detach a strong souadron and send it
to Vladivostok to cut oft the Russian
ships and confine them to the harbor
so that they could do no further dam
age. The former purpose failed, owing
to the celerity of Rear Admiral Yes
zan's movements." , " .
There is no expectation that Teszan
will risk an encounter with a superior
force by putting to sea even on a raid

HAS NEWS OF BATTLE.
Washington Advices State That Jap-
anese Were Victorious.
"NWASHINGTON, April 30.â Reports
have reached the State Department,
the source* of which the officials do not
care to, divulge, to the effect that a
great battle has- been fought on the
Yalu River, resulting in a complete
Japanese victory. - Details are- unob
tainable, t
The- Japanse leg-atfon here has no
news confirming these reports, but
they have aroused intense Interest in
official circles. Reports which have
from time to time reached the Wash
ington Government from Its agents in
the field said that the two armies
would not come into touch before May 5
1, and that what had hertofore oc
curred were nothing more" than mere
outpost skirmishing and collisions be
tween scouting parties. It Is believed
now, however, that the weather-condi
tions in Manchuria have improved suf
ficiently to facilitate the movements of
troops and artillery, and that the two
vanguards have come together a few
day's in advance cf the expected date.
The State Department's advices
place the scene of the Japanese cross
ing of the Yalu at Chlntiencheng, a
town on the Manchurian side of- the
river, which, it is reported, was
finally captured by the Japanese. The
date of the battle is stated to have
been last Tuesday and the delay in re
ceiving the news Is ascribed * to | the
absence of telegraphic facilities in this

4 The special commission appointed

established beyond a doubt the fact
that the battleship struck a mine laid

explosion of this mine under 'the

ST. PETERSBURG. April 20.â The
Emperor received a telegram from
General Kuropatkin,. under to-day's
date,. as "follows: '-. \ Â¦â¢; â¢
"General Sasuljtch reports that the
night of April 28-29 passed quietly.
Small bodies of Japanese are moving
on the'right bank of the Talu, at the
mouth of which stream steamers are
arriving. On April 28, at about 2 in the
afternoon, Japanese. columns were seen
going from Yongampho toward Wiju
and a party of Japanese scouts was
seen on a mountain, southward of Sin
diaju. The Japanese have not yet un
dertaken any active operations."
The absence of telegrams from Rear
Admiral Yeszen to-day was ' regarded
at the Admiralty as proof that the
Japanese, have not attempted to bom
bard Vladivostok. -
It is. understood that Vice Admiral
Choukin, . now" commanding the naval
cadets' school, will succeed Vice Ad
miral Skrydloff as commander of the
Russian Black Sea fleet, and. that Ad

Choukin. Â¦ , â¢ . #
Russia has called'th'e attention of the
Peking Government to reports received
from Russian military authorities in
dicating tliat Japanese officers are
making their way through Mongolia to
the railroad near Harbin, with the In
tention of destroying it. The officers
who were executed ten , days ago at
Harbin came through Mongolia.
As a result of his Investigations Em
bassador McCormick finds that, exclu
sive of 57Q Japanese, on the island of
Saghalien* the total number of Japa
r.tse in Siberia is 351, of- whom sixty
three- are in the* province of Amur,
chiefly at -Port Zeya; 2S0 in the pro-,
vince of Prlraorvsk,* phiefly at Niko
laievsk, and a, major and his wife, five
soldiers, two merchants and an inter
preter, under' arrest as spies. They
are "being concentrated â¢ at Stretinsk,
whence,' as soon as navigation- Is
opened, they will â¢ be forwarded to Ir
kutsk. , From there they will go to
Berlin via the Black Sea, the Russian
authorities desiring to transport them
so far as possible by water..
Without a dissenting voice the Rus
sian press approves of the decision of
the Government, as announced in its
circular note, not to permit mediation
and warning the rowers that they
must keep their . hands off when the
terms of peace are settled. The Svet

to have died. Of the company lost
there were two captains, two first and
one second lieutenants,, the ensign, 73
privates and two Interpreters. Of the
survivors, ten were slightly and not
seriously wounded." ' ' ; -*â¢â¢â¢ ".;
to the Japanese on the Talu, it is evi
! dent that the latter expected a show
of defense on the river, and some sur
prise is manifested even here that prac
tically no attempt was made to im
pede the enemy's forces. In explana
tion of this it is significantly intimated
by ' members^ of the general staff that
General Kuropatkin had some secret
plans and that the Japanese may soon
find - themselves Â¦ in a trap. General
Kuropatkin's ~ skill as a strategist is
a thing in which the Russian army re
poses blind faith.
. "Wait until, the denouement," offi
cers of the general staff say.
. . They. consider that General Kuropat
kin's skill as a strategist approaches
Â¦real . genius. Many of the- officers
claim 'that.. as chief of f staff. General
Kuropatkin was largely instrumental
in organizing the victories of General
Skobeloff.' and they delight to tell how,
years ago^ during the big field maneu
vers at Moscow Against Grand -Duke
Sergius, he . drew the whole of the
Grand Duke's artillery into an ambus
cade, ending the campaign at a single
stroke.
It is estimated. here that it will take
the Japanese at least a week to bring
over their men and baggage and to
prepare for an advance upon the first
Russian line, which is strongly posted
at Fengwangcheng, fifty miles west of
the Yalu. on the Peking road.
â¢The general staff does ' not believe
that it will be possible for the Japan
ese to deliver successful frontal at
tacks on this position, the country ..be
ing exceedingly, difficult and also fa
vorable # for 'disastrous ambuscades.
The members of the staff are ( in
clined to believe the Japanese will try
a flanking to the north
ward, but say that if they do so it can
only be a diversion, owing to the bad
condition* In which the. roads will be
for the next fornight. The talents of
the respective commanders as strate
gists, it is expected, will be demon
strated by a series of moves and coun
termoves. .
Within the last few days General
Kuropatkin. has advised the Emperor
that he is well satisfied with the dis
positions . made of the Russian troops
to meet the Japanese advance upon the
Fengwangcheng line. He also has made
a favorable report on the strength of
the Haicheng line, above Newchwang.
and the conditions on the Liaotung
Peninsula.
It is said that General Kuropatkin,
upon his arrival at Llaoyarif?, doubted
the expediency of holding that place,
but he is now convinced that it should
and can be held. While it is admitted
that the Japanese may bs able to land
at several places on the peninsula, and
even cut the railway, it is believed that
they will not care to take, the risks in
volved in such movements. Vice Ad
miral Togo could easily hold the Rus
sian fleet in port during the disem
barkation of the Japanese troops, but
to insure their safety afterward he
would be compelled to maintain con
stantly a . superior force outside thÂ£
harbor to prevent the possibility of the
Russian fleet seizins the Japanese base
and cutting off communications,
leaving them to sustain, unsupported,
a land attack.
Â¦ "An invasion of Lraotung would be
like an invasion of England." remarked
an officer of the staff, "as Field Jt2v
shal Count von Moltke said: "There are
many ways in, but not a singl-* way
out.' "

- Â«TEPS OF MODERN PROGRESS. '
"Mr. Chairman and Fellow Citizens:
When one sees the expense knd the ef
fort andenergy necessary to make the
exposition," the opening of which we
cflebrate to-day, it is natural- tri doubt
ifhether the eood is commensurate
#ith the costl In less than a year this
plty.of magnificent structures will have
disappeared, this collection of every;
thing ( from 'every where will have ; been
dissipated and" nothing will remain but
the site where it was, but the memory
of its beauty and grandeur. The doubt,
though a' natural one, is only evidence
that we do not believe as ; wÂ» should,
the meaning of this exposition. It is
a j mile stone in the progress of the
world. | Each nation is striving to show
how, since (he last, world's exposition,
it has handled and added to the talent
confided to its care. This is the union
of nations In a progress toward higher
material and spiritual existence. It is
the measuring \ rod "of that for which
myriads of hands and myriads of
brains have been strivingâ an increase
In the control which mind and muscle
have over. the Inanimate resources that
nature furnishes. Not alone in the me
chanical sciences, but In" the fine arts,
in education, in philosophy, in religion,
by comparison of the leaders of
thought had In ; personal conference,
are all of these steps of modern pro
gress marked, and while the buildings
and the machines and the congresses
and. the beauty and the glamor and the
pomp of such a celebration and expo
sition as this shall pass into memory,'
and every material evidence disappear,
the measurement , that thev make of
progress, noticed as it is in the history
of the world, becomes a benefit to man
kind/the value of which cannot be ex
aggerated. It reduces the size of our
world in that it brings all nations Into
one; small locality for a time. but. it
increases enormously the efficiency 'of
those engaged in carrying on '.the
world's progress, by enabling each to
gather the benefit of the other's work.

CAPACITY . FOR EXPANSION.
"Speaking to-day pn. behalf of the
President of the United States," I can
not but recall. the admirable and dis
criminating address which he delivered
here a year ago upon the historical and
political significance pf that great pur
chase of terrltory'Syhlch this exposition
commemorates ;- how forcibly he point
ed the tremendous^ capacity for ex
pansion and absorption of peoples ojyr
peculiar 7 federal" "system, with its p*TO
vision-for-the b!rth;<fc : new States, alÂ£"
forded: how new It wjfe when this Go\i
ernjnent began, and yet' How -quietly;
successful has been Its- operation, until
now it seems -so natural as to involve
no surprise 'oii* admiration at all. . I am
sure I may "be pardoned- if I invoke at:
tentibn to the/fact that we have at fhis, :
Â£Ke'centfJiar>'. of .the 'jjurcbase of, Loui
siana, entered upon another and a dif
ferent'- kind' of which \in
yolvea the solution of other and differ
ent problems from those presented in
the Louisiana purchase.' They have
been forced upon us without our seek
ing, and they must be solved with. the
same high sense â¢ of . duty, the same
fearlessness and courage, with which
our ancestors met' the startling prob
lems that were. presented by the addi
tion of this wide expanse of territory
of Louisiana.
"That they may _not and prob
ably will not be solved by confer
ring statehood ur>on the new territory
is probable. Augurs of ill. and ruin to
follow from the experience and the so
lution of the problem are not wanting,
but they never have been wanting In
the history of this country, and they
never have' been allowed to control the
fearless grappling of. new problems by
Americans. We have probably reached
a period in the great wealth and pow
er which . we have achieved as a na
tion in which we find ourselves ' bur
dened with the necessity of aiding an
other people to stand upon its feet and
t8ke a short cut to the freedom and
the civil liberty which we and our an
cestors have hammered out. For the
reason that this centennial of the Loui
siana purchase marks the beginning of
the great Philippine problem,, the Gov r
ernment of the ; Philippine Islands has
felt justified in "expending a very large
sum'of. money to make the people who
.come, hgre .to r commemorate the vindi
cation of the great effort of American
enterprise and expansion understand
the conditions which j surround the be
ginnlngr of another. Those who look
forward with dark foreboding to the
result of this new adventure base their
prophecies .of disaster on what they
think is the weakness of the American
people! Those who look forward. to its
success base their judgment and their
optimism on. what has already been ac
compllshed'in the islands and on what
they know the American nation can
do when an emergency and an inevita
ble necessity present themselves. -'/^
POWER OF AMERICAN PEOPLE.
. "Without being *blind to the diffi
culties and dangers, it. gives me the
greatest happiness to know and to say
that the President of the United States,
whom â¢ I unworthily represent to-day,
is. glad to take his stand among those
who believe in the capacity, of the
American people, when aroused by the
call of duty,* to solve any problem of
government, however new, which de
pends solely on the clear-headed, the
honesty, the tne. generosity
and the self-restraint! xit the American'
people." . -
The conclusion of the speech of Sec
retary Taf t was the signal for the open
ing of .the fair;"'- In -the .White House, at
"Washington -President Koosevelt was
waiting for' the signal which was to
tell him that the proper moment had
arrived to touch the golden key that
would open the fair in earnest and set
its manifold machinery In full opera
tion. ' ! .,. . . -;
Secretary Taft had not turned to
resume his seat after, concluding his
speech . .before, the; signal had .been
flashed to Washington over the wires
of the Postal Telegraph Company. In
stantly there was a returning flash,
which started the machlnery.Jn Ma-'
chlhery Hall in operation.
Strictly speaking, this was all that
was accomplished by the Presidential
touch on the* button at Washington.
Operators here were waiting for the
response from the White House and as
quickly as It came they touched the
keys which released the fastenings of
the banners which were secured to
staffs on roofs of all the large ex
hibition palaces. This portion of the
work, as far as could be seen from any
one section of the grounds, was per
fect. Every banner apparently caught
the same breath cf air. and unfurled
and 'floated out as one.

Louisiana- monument was the place
for the cascades.! "This portion, of the
ceremonies' had greater Interest for the

'floqd of water came splashing tumulf

great | crowd which vuitnesse'd. it appre

.Simultaneously with -the rush 'of the
water all the bands burst forth* at v once
into the strains of the "Star-Spangled
Banner." Every 1 mah^in the * great
crowd I uncovered and when, the last
Strain of the . martial . song ha'd died
away the exercises were finished and
the exposition proper had commenced.
The .first, feature"; of IV the. 1 exposition
was the concessionaires' parade. -This
was made up of all the different fea
tures, which will figure on the "Pike"
during the life of the exposition.
The "Pike" is to the St. Louis expoÂ£
sition exactly what the "Midway" was
to the Columbian Exposition in - Chi

In character, furnish . â¢ practically ' the

in this" parade some who had actually
been present upon the famous Midway
eleven years ago, and many who had
not been seen or heard of at that time.

as follows on behalf of the body of
which he is head:
"An act of Congress, approved
March 3, 1901, gave national recogni
tion to the exposition we this day open
to the public. In appropriating five
million dollars In. aid of the. project
Congress expressed the nation's ap
proval of the proposal . to fittingly
celebrate the centennial anniversary
of the great historic event the exposi
tion is intended- to commemorate. â¢'
"By Joint action, of the national
commission and company the work of
women In connection with the expo
sition has been placed in. charge of a
board of lady managers appointed un
der authority of Jaw. r "The friendly,
disposition of the National Govern
ment had been steadfast from the be
ginning. With cheerful alacrity time
for- preparation was- extended v tfne
year by Congress upon request of the
company and a. loan of $4,600,000 was
made by Congress to meet all obliga
tions of the exposition up to this day
of opening. If the original appropria
tion of % 5,000,000 be added to this
loan and the aggregate amount
directly and indirectly expend
ed and. authorized by . the Â¦* Gov
ernment for construction and of
ficial exhibits upon the fair grounds is
taken into account it will be found
that financially the United States is
to-day concerned in the exposition to
the extent of nearly $15, 000,000, thus
practically duplicating in this 'cele
bration the price paid for the libuis
iana Territory 100 years ago. " Â¦Â¦'Â¦"-: \ .

one. The main structure is 50x100
feet and there is an addition at each
end in the shape of an Esquimau hut.
There are now six Esquimaux here,
who are native artists and have been
employed in decorative work. They
will be sent back soon and in their
stead will come five basket weavers
and ivory carvers.. .Alaska day will be
October 16, and it Is hoped to' have
the Metlakatla native band of fifteen
pieces here on that date. .
Minerals, furs, fish and curios from
the principal exhibit in the Alaska
building. On the way are moose
heads, deer heads, native eagle shields,
nuggets and many other articles.
The inside finish of the building is
of native cedar, which has a fine
grain and takes a splendid polish.
In the summer the agricultural
products of Southeastern Alaska,
which are said to be of excellent
quality, will be shown.
Mrs. Hart is especially proud of the
educational display and that of
women's work in Alaska. She gath
ered the curios, photographs and spe
cimens of native art, J. Davies col
lected the minerals, D. Fales, Forestry
Commissioner, supplied the cedar, and
Governor Brady secured the totem
poles. These poles are about thirty
feet high and represent bears, ravens,
frogs, or whatever may be the . em
blem of the tribe to which their owner
belongs. They are set in Alask/i in
front of the houses of the aristocracy
and compartments cut in them hold
the charred bones of the dead.mem
bers of the family. Fantastically, and
in some cases hideously ornamented,
they present ; a sight that quickly at
tracts the curious. \\ . .
ST. LOUIS, April 30. â Inside a for
est of totem poles, charm agsftnst any
evil that might come from the Igor
rotes or the bolo men not far away.
Alaska sits with her wares displayed
waiting for the world to see. The
novel sight of the grotesque polos
drew a great throng to the building
to-day and air were warmly welcomed
by Governor Brady of the Territory
and Mrs. Mary E. Hart, manager of
the exhibit and hostess.
Alaska has one of the most unique
and instructive exhibits on the
grounds and great interest is going to
be awakened in the Territory through
it. San Francisco is interested in the
advance of Alaska, as she derives
much trade from the northern Terri
tory.

Indian, Egyptian, kafflr and broom
corn. Some cornstalks from fifteen to
eighteen feet in height are displayed.
Wheat, barley and other grains -in
sheaves form an attractive feature in
the decorations. Like all the exhibits
from California, Kings Corinty and
the Laguna de Tache will attract at
tention by the gr,eat variety of prod
ucts shown. . Besides the excellent
showing of corn and. cereals there are
many varieties of garden vegetables
exhibited in glass â peanuts, almonds,
castor beans, several varieties of edible
beans, seeds of various kinds, cotton
and tobacco. Alfalfa will be shown as
the greatest and best feed for stock
and dairy cattle. The exhibit con
tains" also a fine selection of fruits in
solution â dried fruits of many vari
eties and raisins.- The exhibit is em
bellished with many large photo
graphs illustrative of agricultural con
ditions in the irrigated portions of
Fresno and Kings counties. One of
the features of the exhibit is a model
forty-acre irrigated farm, showing the
canals, ditches and gates and alfalfa
and cqrn fields, orchards and vineyards
in approved proportions. The exhibit
is In the same block as that of Fresno
County and some of the features are
installed jointly with Fresno. A har
monious design and color scheme has
been observed throughout both ex
hibits. The whole forms one of \ the
creditable units of California's great
display. The exhibit is under the di
rection of W. N. Harris of Laton, Cali
fornia.
Kings County Joins With Laguna de
Tache in a Most Striking
Exhibit.
Kings County has joined with the
Laguna de Tache grant in its exhibit,
which is typical of the irrigated sec
tions of Central Calif ornisf The main
SHOWS FRUITS OF
IRRIGATED IiANDS
Raisins, the great product of Fresno
County, are prominent in her display,
which Is one of the most creditable in
the California exhibit and shows well
for the ' committee that arranged it.
The Laguna de Tache, Grant exhibits
alongside this county, as its 68,000
acres lie both in Fresno and Kings
counties. Charles F. Weyer is in
charge here for Fresno. The county
is represented also in the Educa
tional and Forestry buildings, her dis
play in the latter being a fine one.
The exhibit in the Agricultural build
ing is on one of the main aisles. Just
at the right of the main entrance to
the . building. The chief exhibit occu
pies a space 45x17 *Â£ feet In addition
to this Fresno is making the raisin
exhibit for the State.
The plan of the central structure is
Egyptian in design and very suitable
to the whole arrangement, considering
the vast amount of material to be dis
played in a. given space. There are
many pyramids and arches, cleverly
arranged to display the_ county's prod
ucts to advantage. Quite a departure
is made in the color scheme. Wood
colors and gold predominate, while
green and red seem to be the colors
adhered to by the other counties.
The display made by Fresno is a
rich one and it will set the people
from less favored climes agape when
they gaze on it. She shows wonder
ful raisins in great clusters, put up
in commercial packages and fancy
boxes for. display; Calimyrna figs that
rival the famous ones of Smyrna,
Adriatic figs, honey, cereals' of many
sorts, nuts, olive oil, olives, lemons,
oranges, canned and dried fruits and
marmalade. The Fresno Chamber of
Commerce makes a special display, in
cluding fruits in solution and raisins.
Display Is One of the Most Credlt

RAISINS A FEATURE
AT THE FRESXO BOOTH
albums of scenes taken in and 'around
the city. of Stockton. There are six
of these albums.
On the outside of the booth, ar
ranged in tiers in front of plate glass
mirrors, are jars of processed fruits
and vegetables and pyramids of olive
oil, wine, beer, preserves and aspara
gus. The base of the booth- is sur
rounded with glass-covered boxes dis
playing beans, cereals and grain prod
ucts, such as flour, germea and so
forth; seeds, dried fruit, nuts, maca
roni, and, in fact, samples of every
thing produced in the county.
Between Missouri and San Joaquin
County is a flat wall fifteen feet high.
San Jbaquin has covered its side of
this with dark red burlap and
decorated it with pictures, framed to
correspond with those in the inside
of the booth, maps and burned wood
signs. The color scheme of the booth
is dark green, dark red and ivory
white. The f rdnt and rear entrances
are inclosed with arched columns ris
ing twenty-five feet above the floor
level. The columns and arches are
neatly decorated with staff.
The booth is one of the handsomest
in the California section and this, to
gether with its excellent location,
makes it one of the prominent booths
in the building. The San . Joaquln
County display is completed.
The. San Joaquin exhibit is being
conducted by the Stockton Chamber
of Commerce and is in charge of Col
vin B.- Brown, secretary of the cham
ber. .He is, one of the hustlers in the
California section and has been very
successful In getting his display ready.
A feature connected with the Stock
ton booth that is sure to be much ap
preciated by San Joaquin County visi
tors is the fact that chairs and lockers
have been provided for the use and
convenience of Stocktonians and San
Joaqulnites who may visit St. Louis
this summer. As free seats will be
hard to find, and there, are to be no
free checking bureaus, the arrange
ment at the Stockton booth promises
to be a boon to the home people.
San Joaquin County's booth lies di
rectly in front of the main entrance
on 'the east side of the agricultural
building and is the first booth seen
by all' who enter at that side'. As this
east entrance promises from its loca
tion to be more used than any other
of the entrances, San Joaquln has an
excellent location. The space occupied
by this county is 30x35 feet and it
lies in the southeast corner of the
California space, being bounded on the
south by Missouri, on the north by a
State honey exhibit and on the east
and west by main aisles.
The booth proper is fifteen feet high
and is built Â¦ tvlth i a , view: to showing
the exhibit material , on the outside.
Inside of the structure is a neatly fur
nished room, 10x12 feet. The walls
of this interior room are covered, with
dark red burlap, upon which are hung
sepia enlargements of farm scenes
typical of San' Joaquin County. The
smallest of these pictures is 2x3 feet
and ,the largest' is 4x7 feet/ The '; pic
tures are framed in redwood and have
brass name, plates, on" wÂ£ich are print
ed descriptions of the . scenes depicted.
There'; are eight â¢ of these pictures in
this room and they; form a very' inter
esting part : of the San Joaquin exhibit.

San Luis Oblspo County keeps apace
of Santa Barbara and her crayfish by
exhibiting the largest clam ever taken
alive. She does not look to this clam,
however, for her prosperity, and only
displays It to show that even the sea
yields bountifully on her borders. San
Luis Obispo exhibits Jointly with Mon
terey, Santa. Clara being next to them,
but not Joined. R. L. Janney is in
charge of the exhibit of the two coun
ties, and it Is of a unique nature,
though not 'appearing to as fine ad
vantage now as it will later on, when
needed material can be obtained. The
scheme of the Joint display is a grape
arbor with open sides and ends. At
present this arbor is 'covered with
sheaves of wheat and natural grasses,
but as soon as the grapevines have
grown their leaves genuine vines will
be used.
The exhibit has the length desired,
Mr. Janney relinquishing some space
so as to get a section best fitted to his
design. The space is now 17^x31 feet,
with a height in the clear of twelve
feet, which slopes to ten. There is a
rail, composed of alternate displays of
scenic photographs. and seeds. The en
trance is .on the *main aisle, and at
front and back are shelves on which
rest processed and dried fruits and the
various other products of these two fer
tile counties, including oranges, lemons
and highly developed cereals. Around
the rail is a unique decoration j of aba
lone shells, which are brilliantly colored
and make a handsome show.
The big clam weighs five pounds and
is kept in a glass Jar.
San Luis Oblspo has the world's rec
ord for pumpkins, having produced
one that weighed 380 pounds. Another
weighing 302 pounds has been kept in
cold storage since last January, and if
it is in condition will be brought on
and' given a place beside the clam.
This Exhibit Needs More Display Ma
terial, but Walts Upon the
Season.

Beautiful Santa Barbara, where the
great mission grape , vine that cov
ers land enough almost to make
a farm grows, is here with
the product of her field and
hill and the sea that murmurs ever at
her feet. C. N. Merrltt is in charge
of her exhibit Olive oil and beans
seem to be ' the mean features of her
elaborate Bhow, which is arranged with
a taste that brings much admiration.
True, she displays the largest crayfish
ever taken in the toils on the Pacific
Coast, but this 1b merely a side show,
a pike diversion from the main enter
tainment. '
In the center of this county's space,
also 18x20 feet, rises a stately olive
oil tower, which seems to almost pierce
the roof. On it are bottles of oil of
many varieties. Luscious honey is
shown in glass cases and all the va
rious fruits, dried and preserved, are
displayed. There Is also grain in
sheaves, showing the productiveness of
her cereal lands. Beans, the great prod
uct of Santa Barbara, 1 are honored by
being used for decorative purposes.
The crayfish exhibited is forty-eight
inches- long and Is in a glass case.
Some of the rival County Commission
ers .insist on calling it a lobster, but
Mr., Merritt says he will not have his
county known, as possessing the big
gest lobster In the world.

LARGEST CRAYFISH
AS A SIDESHOW
Santa Clara County, whose miles of
fruit trees blend into a. seemingly
boundless ocean of bloom in the early
spring, and her chief city, San. Jose,,
are making a magnificent display. The
central . structure is of ambitious ar
chitectural design. It is of composite
mission design and to any but a Cali
fornian. who readily recognizes its in
spiration, it has something of the ap
pearance of a handsome temple. ' This
structure is seemingly built of prunes,
for every inch of it, save the base, the
Lick Observatory at the top and some
spaces occupied by fancy figures done
In dried apricots and peaches and
arched recesses where immense Jars of
fruit stand, is covered with this fruit.
It took six men nearly a week to put
this veneer of prunes on the pine ex
terior of the building.
When Santa Clara prepared to. ex
hibit at the World's Fair she decided to
make use of the world fame of the Lick
Observatory that greater attention
might be attracted to her display. On
the top of the mission temple stands
a large model of i the observatory.
Visitors seeing this- at once identify
Santa Clara with it and know, before
they read the names "Santa Clara
County" and "San Jose" over the
arches at which exhibit they are gaz
ing.
Exposition rules made one 'change in
Santa Clara's booth necessary and it
will appear a little different from what
the Santa Clarans will expect to see It
when they visit the fair. The low
mission doors have been broadened
into high and broad arches, too much
inclosure being forbidden. Quaint
mission bells hang in the low windows
at the top.
Electric lights glisten under the
arches and others are arranged to il
luminate many of the Jars of fruit.
Santa Clara exhibits almost every fruit
grown in California, Including lemons
and oranges. She has the largest seed
farms in the world and makes a com
plete display in this line.
Around the base of the booth car
tons of dried fruits with fancy designs
are shown. A magnificent display of
scenic photographs,' some of them lOx
13 feet in size, adds to the general
beauty, of Santa. Clara's show.
Some space is given up to a display
of; Maraschino, or cocktail, . cherries,

The majority of Californians are
pretty familiar by this time, by picture
and description, with the California
building. It stands on a knoll Just
across from the Agricultural building
and close to the Intermural Railway,
which runs to all parts of the ground.
Because It is not near the "Terrace of
States" it seems somewhat isolated.,
but is really Just about the centerypf'

After several hundred paintings by
California artists had been vised by a
committee in San Francisco eighty
were selected and sent on for exhibi
tion in the Fine Arts building at the
fair. The Louisiana Purchase commit
tee vised the eighty and as a result,
but five of them have been hung in
the Fine Arts building. Some of the
others, which are all splendid works,
will be hung in the California building.
California's educational display is in
the hands of Robert Furlong, who for
twenty years was â¢ Superintendent of
Schools in Marln County. It occupies
a large space, 1600 square feet, and
compares favorably with that of any
other State, not even the oldest ones
surpassing it. There are eighty-four
cabinets containing specimens sent
from schools all over the State. A red
wood facade with arches, and cornice
incloses the exhibit.

They wished to do- this as an adver

for this each upon the other. The for

The case of William Hensley.
charged -with a felony, was stricken
from the calendar in Judge Lawlor's
court yesterday, as the Judge had been
notified that the defendant had died
on April 28. He had been out on $250
cash bail. He had been waiting trial
on a charge of taking away Sadie
Cook, 17 years of age, for immoral
purposes on October 16, 1901.
Goes to a Higher Tribunal.
Oceana Erwin of Benicia, sister of
the late Celia P. Cronk, secured a
citation yesterday directing Walter
Cronk, her late sister's husband and
administrator of her estate, to appear
and show cause why his bond should
not be Increased. She claims that the
bond of $100 he furnished when he
was appointed administrator is insuf
ficient and says that he has not per
formed his duties as he should.
Claims Bond Is Too Small.
Doe died in 1894. His will provided
that the bulk of his great estate should
go to his two brothers, Bartlett and
Charles Doe. to be held In trust by
them for the benefit of the widow and
daughter. Upon death of the broth
ers, the trust was to be continued un
til the day the daughter arrived at the
age of 18 years, when half of the trust
was to be distributed to her. The re
maining half was still to be held for
the benefit of Mrs. Stetson, she to en
joy the income until her death, when
the principal would pass to the-daugh
ter, thus giving the latter the entire
estate.
After faithfully adhering to the terms
of her husband's will for ten years,
the widow of John S. Doe, now Mrs.
John B. Stetson, is making an attack
upon the validity of the trust clause
In the document, which gives her only
a life interest in the Doe estate. She
has asked that the trust be declared
void and that half of her late hus
band's estate, which is worth consid
erably more than $1,000,000, be dis
tributed to her absolutely. Her peti
tion was argued in Judge Coffey's court
yesterday, Attorneys Garret McEner
ney and Heller & Powers opposing it
and Charles S. Wheeler appearing for
the widow.
In the event that Mrs. Stetson's at
tack is successful, the chie'f sufferer
will be Mary Marguerite Doe, the
daughter of Mrs. Stetson by her mar
riage to the man whose will she is
now seeking to break. The fortune de
vised to her by her father will be re
duced one-half if the trust clause is
knocked out.

got me into this trouble," said Mrs.
Mary Gorman to Judge Mogan, before
wham she stood charged with having
stolen $6 50 from a Mr. Meyers.
"How did it come to pass, Mrs. Gor

"Well, a strange gentleman stopped
me on the street and, addressing me by

to find out whether he was joshing that
I accepted his Invitation to . take a

the Judge.
"You bet It wasn't," said Mrs. Gor

"Mr. niley, your consideration
charms me," said the Judge, "and Â»it
shall not be ignored when I hand out
your medicine day after, to-morrow."
"You needn't put yourself to the
trouble of searching the records for
previous convictions." was Joseph
Rlley's hint to Judge Mogan, "because
I concede that I have been found guilty
of petty larceny and several minor of

Chief of Police Wittman glanced
through his office window day before
yesterday and saw the bench-warmers
in Portsmouth square being systemat
ically harassed and annoyed by Arthur
Shea, whom he recognized as an old of
fender. The Chief dispatched a subor
dinate to arrest Arthur and charge him
with disturbing the peace, all of which
was promptly and neatly accomplished.
Three months In the County. Jail was
prescribed for Arthur by Judge Mogan.
Mrs. E. Bromley read in last Thurs
day's Call of how James Moffatt had
been given two months' imprisonment
for working 1 the worthless check game,
and the printed description of the de
fendant tallied so closely to that of an
aged man that had victimized her by
similar means that she visited the
prison and identified James Moffatt as
the same person. Then she filed a com
plaint against him, and- yesterday he
was given three months more by Judge
Cabaniss. James has been pursuing
his swindling specialty since 1877 and
Is now in his eighty-sixth year.
Parisian politeness obstructed busi
ness in Judge Fritz's court until eighty
one-year-old Louise D. Vincent and her
attorney were, ejected by the bailiff. A
charge of vagrancy against the lady
was dismissed as soon as his Honor
saw her silver hairs and ascertained
her age, and she Immediately began
overwhelming her legal adviser with
grisette.-llke blandishments, while he
gallantly bowed and scraped his ac

Bowman, nattily attired and with hair
parted in the middle, was given sixty
days In the County Jail by Judge Mo
gan. The defendant asked to have a
fine imposed, so that wealthy relatives
in the East could come to his rescue,
but the court stood firm.
"You are the most dangerous kind of
swindler. Mr. Bowman," said hiB
Honor,- "because your respectable ap
pearance and suave manner succeed in
deceiving people who are anything but

Meyers to-morrow if she is willing and
he adheres to the resolution he uttered
yesterday In the "presence of Police
Judge Fritz, before whom he was ac
cused of battery upon" the girl's mother.
Mrs. Warner, who is separated from
her husband, dwells at 1518 Masonic
avenue, and last Friday afternoon while
passing an Ellis-street lodging-house
of unsavory repute she 1 was both as
tonished and pained to see her daugh
ter emerge therefrom with young Mey
ers. With maternal indignation she
upbraided the girl, whom she had im
agined to be with her father, and also
expressed her opinion of Meyers, who
thereupon, she avers, struck her. ,Then
Bhe summoned Patrolman Fogarty and
had her assailant arrested. The girl
ran away.
When the case was called before
Judge Fritz the mother, a careworn
looking woman, was accompanied by
Officer Young of the Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Children, and
he It was ; who quietly suggested to the
court that marriage of the defendant
to the girl might be the best thing that
could be arranged for both of them.
Meyers, who keeps a cigar store on
Fourth street and is well able to sup
port a helpmeet, expressed -willingness
to lead Miss Warner to the altar, and
he was remanded until to-morrow,
when the girl will be taken to court
and given opportunity to assume wife
hood.
It Is understood that Mrs. Warner
has no objection to Meyers becoming
her son-in-law, and that Mr. Warner
would hail his daughter's' wedding as
a welcome relief from paternal respon
sibility.

A number of witnesses for the de

charged him with six prior convictions,
had been altered to five, and evidence
was again taken with the object 6f as
certaining who had made the altera

Kezo Topazi, a Japanese, who pleaded
guilty In Judge Cook's court to a
charge of making and passing a ficti
tious check for $50 on Y. Kosako, 525
Pine street, on January 22, was sen
tenced yesterday to serve ten years in

letter to the Judge, who intended to be
lenient with him, but when he found
that there was a prior conviction
against the prisoner for forging the
name of the late W. W. Foote, while
acting as Foote's valet, he gave him
the limit.
The letter sent by Topazi to the Judge
is as follows:

The California State structure stands
next to the Illinois State building.' and
the â¢ Fraternal Hall and Temple Inn are
Its neighbors. Not far away is the great
Agricultural building, the largest struc
ture in the world, having twenty acres
under one roof. Directly opposite thÂ©
California building are the Japanese
gardens.
The California building has a facade
100 feet long. The depth of the main
structure is 45 feet. At the back is a
lecture hall, 40x35 feet in size. The floor
plan places an assembly hall in the cen
ter. This is heavily beamed, in the Mis
sion style, with trunks of trees. Out
from the assembly hall are the men's
parlor and women's parlor. Back of the
assembly hall is the office and informa
tion bureau. On the upper floor of the
building the rooms are arranged in
suites for the accommodation of the
commissioners, the secretary of the-com
mission and the families of the official
party, who will dwell therein during the
Exposition. *
The California State building at the
Louisiana Purchase Exposition, at St.
Louis, stands on a hill, in a conspicuous
position,, near. tn4 center of the Exposi
tion grounds. While there are many re
markable buildings that will attract the
attention' of millions of visitors while
the Exposition gates are open, there Is
not one that has more intrinsic interest
than, the California building.
It is a reproduction, with great fidelity
to detail, of the famous 'Santa. Barbara
Mission. To make the reproduction 'per
fect the front has been chipped and
stained and grass seeds have been sown
between the flagstone pavements, that
the ravages of time and the characteris
tics to the most minute degrees may be
presented to the spectator, who may
thereby, see a vista of historical interest
exactly In accordance with the original.
The story is current that no woman
has been allowed to enter the garden of
the Santa Barbara Mission, although
there may have been a few exceptions.
At St. Louis the famous garden is en
tirely reproduced. The fountain is in the
center: the old woode*n benches are imi
tated and are placed as in the Santa Bar
bara Mission garden. The same varieties
of plants that have bloomed for more
than a century for the padres of Santa
Barbara will make up the garden show
at St. Louis. Superintendent McLaren
of Golden Gate Park has been given
charge of the collection of such plants.
Samuel Newsom. the architect of the
building, visited- Santa Barbara several
times and made a study of the garden,
as well as of the building and its sur
roundings, for exposition purposes.
Every Callfornian will wish to have a
picture of the California building at St.
Louis.

BROKERS' REPORTS.
Baldwin & Howell report an important
sale for the Callaghan Estate Company,
comprising a block of land south of
Golden Gate Park fronting the south
line of I street between Seventeenth
and Eighteenth avenues, known as
Sunset block No. 689. Albert Meyer,
the banker, is the buyer. The terms
are private. The block adjoins the
blocks lately subdivided by Baldwin &
Howell, who will subdivide the land
after . sewer work is complete and
streets macadamized.
Interest north of Golden Gate Park
and west of First avenue is largely
stimulated by the contracts that have
been awarded for the improvement of
Clement street, the principal business
street in Richmond. With the excep
tion of one block, the paving with bi
tumen, the sldewalking with cement
and the curbing as far as Ninth ave
nue ts now under' contract. Â¦Â¦. The only
blw:k not under contract Is that be
tween Seventh and Eighth avenues. It
is so manifestly to the Interest of the
property 'owners-to' improve that there
will probably, be little delay. Clement
street, with street improvements equal
to any to be found, will be in position
to rival the retail streets in the central
portions of the city in appearance and
relatively in business Importance. The
entire Richmond district will be bene
fited.
Large Investors in city real estate
are now much engaged in subdividing
great tracts of land and putting them
on the market for residence sites. The
buyers- for eligible properties of this
class are very numerous. The demand
is not confined to any section of the
city. Wherever there is a good place
to live and the prices are not out of
reach for the average buyer, sales are
effected* and the new owners stir about
to get plans, etc., for the homes to be
erected. There has been a great
amount of inquiry west of First ave
nue, nor th and south of the park, and
covering the region that extends all
the way to' the Pacific Ocean. Bankers
are buying blocks and selling them at a
profit In the portion of the city west
of First avenue.
It is announced that, owing to the
great success in the sale by J. C. Jor
dan of the block recently placed on the
market, bounded by California street,
Richmond, Jordan and Michigan ave
nues, Mr. Jordan has been prompted
to offer another half block facing on
Jordan avenue on precisely the same
terms and conditions as governed the
sales in the first block. The building
restrictions prohibit the sale of any
lot for other than strictly residential
purposes. A building containing more
than two fiats is prohibited; - also
stores, churches, schools, laundries, coal
yards, etc. The lots are being sold in
sizes averaging 33:4x120 on terms of
one-fifth cash, balance on time. The
departure Mr. Jordan made in the sale
of this property, from the ordinary
.twenty-five-foot lot without building
restrictions, has proven most success
ful and will doubtless result in a su
perior class of buildings which will cer
tainly tend to improve the value of
the land.
Demand for Sites for Residences Is One of the
Leading Features of the Market and Is Potent
in Keeping Up Record for Volume of Business

>vhich' have gathered round his great
name. Most Kelvin stories which ob
tain in Glasgow are founded upon the
occasional Inability of the great' man
who lisped In logarithms to bring his
mind -to a childish .sum. The famous
one; tells ..how- on his blackboard he
once made^two and two, five, and, hear
ing the chuckles of the delighted class,
altered it hastily to three.. He was,
however,. once heard to say, with his

LARGE STEAMERSâ T. B. H., v Pet
aluma. Cal. Among the largest Atlan
tic* steamers are the Kaiser Wilhelm II
of the-i North German Lloydâ length, 707.
feet; breadth, 72; depth, 57;. tonnage,
19,500 gross. The Oceanic of the White
Star lineâ length. 704 feet; breadth, 63;
depth, 43;, tonnage. 17,274 gross. The
Celtic and the Cedrlc of the same Jino
have the following measurements:
Length, 700 feet; breadth, 7J: depth, 49;
tonnage, 21,400 gross. "The Oceania and
the" Kaiser Wilhelm II are. both longÂ«?
than the Celtic and Cedric, but the lar*
two named have a greater breadth and
tonnage. These two are the first ves
sels of the trans- Atlantic fleet that
have been built with more than 20,000
tons gross. In. view of this, It may be
said that" the Cedric and the Celtic are,
while not the longest, the Iarge'st
steamers . afloat. The length of the
Great Eastern was 692 feet: breadth. S3
feet, and height of hull. 60 feet. She had
a carrying capacity of 5000 tons of mer
chandise and 15.000 of coal for fuel.
THE recent tests that have been offered the first con
testants "fpr, the Rhodes* Scholarships at the Univer
sity of -California and institutions throughout the
East bring into prominence the significance of this edu
cational movement and open again [discussion of the idea's
merits : and demerits. One prominent authority. ..upon
education, Professor - Goldwin Smith, takes a pessimistic
view of the worth of Rhodes' "ethical and\ political de
signs"-as manifested in his generous disposition in favor
of American scholars. He "can see in them, nothing: of
value for the student on.this side of the \vater, who'wins
the privilege of a course at England's venerable uni
versity. , Â¦ ' .:;-.-.Â¦:, Â¦' â¢
"I fail. to sec clearly," saysProfcssor Smith in the last
number of The Nation, "what object can be gained; by
transferring a number of.prominent'students-.in the. form-'
ative', period of life from the universities- of this Â¦ continent
to a social and political atmosphere differentfromthat-iri
which their lives are to be. passed. ' I have "seen'.some- ;
thing both of and 'American 'universities'; and; my
impression is that all ; things' taken : into an
American or Canadian .will â¢ gain no more 1 by^ being â¢trans
planted to .Oxford for Cambridge than,an Oxford or Cam
bridge man 'would gain by being transplanted -to ' a.'uni
versity on this continent." 'â¢. Â¦ .,".;. V .
-While not venturing an exception to .the. opinion of a
man . whose . utterances 'are'; based^upon ; long experience,
it.may.be suggested, nevertheless,' that Professor,. Smith's
views smack somewhat ;of iron-boundi standards' /of
educational science. Lqoking at 'Oxford strictly f rom ! the
point' of view of adjudgment, upon ; its ability . to offer a
fitting /curriculum for graduate study, the 'professbr has

WITHIN the past week readers of San Francisco
papers have had brought to their notice a con
clusive demonstration ; of what a perfectly,
equipped and 1 , energetic news service could accomplish.
On Sunday, April 24, there appeared exclusively in The
Call a complete and authentic account of the < compact
made between the Santa Fe and Southern Pacific rail-'
road systems for the joint control of: existing and 'pro
jected iincs on the Northern California coast, a.mattcr
which has been the subject of rumor and speculation
since the Santa Fe extended; its system into this State.
Following closely upon this exclusive 'announcement

William McCarthy. had served two
terms for burglary in San Quentin, and
when he was in the County Jail await
ing trial for the third time It occurred
to him that he was in a tight box and
a very long term stared him In the face.
He decided upon playing the insanity
dodge, and for two weeks he scarcely
ate any food and remained dumb.
When spoken to he would look blankly
at the speaker and shake his head.
The matter was called to the atten
tion of Judge Cook, and he ordered Mc-
Carthy sent to the Insanity Commis
sioners for examination. He would not
answer any of the questions put to him
by the Commissioners, and he was kept
under surveillance. The^cpncluslon was
reached that he was shamming, and
one of the doctors at the hospital de
cided upon putting him to the test.
McCarthy was strapped to . the oper
ating table and his back bared. The
nurse had -been told to have a bowl of
lukewarm water in readiness, and the
doctor, placing hjs instruments where
McCarthy could see them, picked up
one and pretended to make an incision
in McCarthy's back, while the nurse al
lowed the water to trickle down his
spine. â¢
"Great Scott," ejaculated the doctor,
"there is something seriously wrong
with (that man; his blood Is black in
color. I'll have to cut deeper to see
what's the matter."
..He had just . seized another Instru
ment when McCarthy yelled:
. . J' Wpt's ! de , matter wid you, you
chump. There ain't nothln' wrong wid
me."
"That's just what I thought," replied
the doctor.
Â¦ McCarthy is now serving a long term
in San Quentin.

THE transfer of $40,000,000 to pay the French com
pany for its franchise, construction and rights in
the Panama canal and its stock' in the Panama
Railroad affords a study in the nature and functions .of
money. The United States treasury has the gold ready
to. pay in a lump sum. But the transfer to Paris of so
much' money, when the financial law of gravity is not
demanding its use there, would produce the same. effects
in the financial world as a flood v of water beyond the
needs of the land which it overflows.
International exchange would fluctuate, and if the rate
of 'interest and discount declined, those who* had made
prior use of their credit at the prior rates would be
placed at a disadvantage compared with those whose
credit would be available at a lower rate. In other
words, too much money at a given point, being there
for a reason* not existing in the state of trade and the
demands of commercc,'is as. much embarrassment as too
little. For these reasons it has to be arranged with the
French banks that the payment shall be in such install
ments :as will permit gradual absorption of the whole
without injuriously affecting discounts or exchange. If
the United States had . to borrow the Imoney the case
would J>e different. . Then our bonds for the - amount
would be taken in Paris and the whole sum -would be
furnished from the. existing, store of capital there. It
would simply be changed from one hand to the other
without increase in volume.
It'.is a case in whichour: solvency and our surplus of
cash on hand, making us a readj money and pay
as-we-go country, must make an impression upon Europe.
American pride may well assert itself, "and without of
fense, because we are the only nation in the world that
can pay out $40,000,000 to France and ',$io,ooq,ooo. to
Panama, from cash on hand without going into the mar
ket to borrow. It is also matter for self-congratulation
that this is done for the greatest constructive. work ever
undertaken' by man, that will revolutionize the commerce
of the planet and distribute its benefits to every human
being that lives to sec its completion.

The Russians, it is announced, are willing to hazard
the annihilation of their Baltic fleet to reduce, if pos
sible, the naval odds against them in the Oriental seas.

have no fleet than to have one and not be able to use it.
Young Don Alfonse of Spain, who
only attains his eighteenth birthday
this month, has strengthened to a
very important extent his hold upon
the good will of his subjects and
his prestige abroad by the courago
which he displayed during his ten
days' stay at Barcelona. He had been
urged by his relatives, by his courtiers,
and even by the principal statesmen
of both political parties, as well as by
the press, not to visit Barcelona, which
is renowned as the moat turbulent city
In Europe, and that Is honeycombed
with republicanism, socialism and an
archism. If he had listened to thesw
counsels he would have, remained at
Madrid. But realizing with a precocity
far beyond his age the peculiar po
litical, economical, social and reglon
alist features of the Catalan provinces,
he insisted on going to the spot to
examine the real state of affairs him
self, and not only did he go to Barce
lona, but he visited the resorts and
haunts of the working classes who are
reputed to be anarchists, conversed
with the workmen in their factories in
their own dialect, which he had taken
the trouble to acquire, and generally
behaved like a ruler who had- entire
trust In his subjects.
During his stay- two efforts were"
made to assassinate his Premier,
Senor Maura, the one by means of a
bomb, through the explosion of which
several people were hurt, and the
other with a knife, from which, the
Premier sustained a slight wound. But
the King himself not only escaped un
scathed, but* no attempt was even
made upon, his life, and he. has :~re-r

of the people of Catalonia, who ad

faint hope that, having studied on the
spot the conditions of which they
complained, he may Initiate some steps
toward the remedy of their wrongs.

Perhaps the most remarkable of the
many odd petitions was that presented
by a man some years ago. who prayed
the House of Commons to disconnect
a telephone wire which he stated had
been laid to his brain by the 'detective
department of the Scotland Yard, in
order to discover his secret thoughts
and whether he was in any way con
nected with dynamite outrages.
Every petition, however, whether it
it is of an important character or oth
erwise, and signed by a million Brit
ish subjects or only one, is dealt with
in the most formal manner. At the
commencement of each session . the
House of Commons appoints its select
committee to report on th'e number
and nature of petitions presented, to
gether with the number of signatures
attached. It Is also the duty of the
select committee not only to count the
signatures, but to see that each one
Is genuine.
With regard to the latter, point, one
authority asserted some time ago that
if the whole of the petitions which are
sent to Parliament were sifted from
top to bottom It Is probable that not
more than 25 per cent of genuine sig
natures would be found among them.
The fraud which was discovered In
connection with the famous '- monster
Chartist petition of 1848 emphasized
the necessity of carefully examining
the signatures attached to Parliamen
tary petitions. No fewer than 5,706,000
persons were stated to have signed this
petition; but on examination It waa
found that the real number was 1,975,
496. Thousands of Â¦-. signatures were
found to be ' bogus and written by. the
same hand. Among the forgeries , ap
peared such names as No Cheese, Pug
Nose. Flat / Nose, Longshanks and
Calfshead.
Of recent years the most remarkable
petition, perhaps, which a select com
mittee has had to investigate was that
presented In 1887, referring to the aboli
tion of coal and wine duties. A young
man named j Reginald . Bldmead con
fessed to having forged thousands of
signatures. He had been employed to
get them at so much-per hundred, and,
instead of troubling, people to [sign, he
set to work to write thousands; of
names with his own hand. When ex
amined- before the committee he de
clared . that it was his poverty -.which
led him to 'do -this, and naively added,
"I did not think I should be doing any
body a serious injury,: not knowing. the
value of the petition throughout; and I
thought I could wrltethem all myself."
Mr. Netherclif t, the .handwriting ex
pert, who gave evidence , at this In
quiry, stated that Â¦ he Â¦ had examined a
large number of petitions, and that a
considerable proportion t of .' the signa
tures were spurious. : It- was further
learned that one petition contained the
names ' of thirteen " racehorses; while
other facetious persons . had attached
such names as W. H. Smith, : M. Hicks-
Beach, and r AJ. J. Balfour/' whose ad
dress, by-the-by, was given as â¢ Mare
street. Hackney.â Tit Bits.
Another petitioner, in praying to
the House to grant his request, was
magnanimous enough to add that he
would "ever pray to the Lord to for
give their for not having done so
sooner."
No less absurd than the Irishman's
petition was that of a man who prayed
the House to appoint a select commit
tee to inquire Into x his Identity. He
went eg to explain that his birth and
parentage were involved In mystery,
he having been left on a doorstep' when
an infant.
The present system of dealing with
petitions by a select committee was
established In 1S33, and since then
something like 200.000 petitions, con
taining considerably over 200,000,000
signatures have been received and re
ported upon. Many of them." of course,
have been petitions dealing with im
portant questions of the day, while, on
the other hand, a large number have
been of a ridiculous character and
totally unworthy of the attention of
the House. Some people seem to pos
sess a mania for sending" petitions to
the House of Commons, and, like the
Irishman who petitioned that the girl
who "had the cheek to jilt him might
suffer due pains and penalties," evi
dently consider that one of the main
duties of Parliament is to redress the
grievances, real or imaginary, of any
private individual who may care to ap
ply to it.
The rlarht which every Britisher has
of petitioning the sovereign or either
house of Parliament for the redress of
grievances is not likely to fall ip to dis
use through not being sufficiently ex
ercised. As a matter of fact, there is
more likelihood of k this fundamental
principle of the British constitution
suffering through being too frequent
ly employed, for on more than one oc
casion the Committee, which
deals v.ith petitions in the first place
and reports on them to ! the House,
have given ft as their opinion "that the
right of petitioning the House of-Com
mons has of late years been subjected
to serious abuse, and merits the atten
tion of the House." .

THE first of the great meetings of >the year injCali-}

and Europe, and from every Â¦ division of ;. the Western

When John Wesley started as a ' conie-outer from
the established church and incurred the disabilities which'
in those days beset a nonconformist, his most exalted
vision could not have foreseen the mighty things
pendent upon his assertion of liberty of conscience. The
seed that .he planted has grown, in the line of -his own
independence, and in following the progress of the^age,
has gone far beyond much of his thought and some' of
his beliefs.
Wesley partook of some of the leading superstitions of
his time. Like Sir MaHjiew Hale and Cotton Mather
and all Christendom, he believed in witchcraft, and
planted his feet firmly upon the Scriptural injunction,
"Thou shalt not permit a .witch to live." Time and prog
ress have canceled that superstition, and if Wesley
could return in the flesh, still believing it, he would be
as much out of place in^ a Methodist conference as if he
were a-Druid priest. Much of the order of his day has
dissolved. In this other Christian bodies are like unto
that which he founded. The Presbyterians have, built an
expiatory, monument in Geneva, on the spot" where Ser
vctus was burned at the instance of Calvin. But ac
knowledgment of the harshness of Calvin's judgment
against heresy in no wise impairs the truth that was in
his theology.
Modern Christendom respects the rights of, reason
and of conscience. As many roads, trod by many peo
ple, lead to the cities of the world, and their conver
gence thereon is the great purposed their being, so it
has come to be accepted that many roads may lead to
the city eternal, and that all that travel thitherward are
to be hailed by the same great countersign of brother
hood.
As Wesley was with his age in the one gloomy and
pervading superstition, he was far ahead of it in a vis
ion of the great fact of modern science. He was abe
liever in evolution, which in his day had not been 're
duced to a hypothesis nor in terms formulated. But he
held it in common with Baron d'Holbach and . other
free-minded philosophers, and was so earnest in his
conviction that it accounted for the presence of life and
the origin of species that he pcrpetuated : his views in a
volume that is a monument to his logical mind and pains
taking stud}'.
His lasting work, however,. was the development of a
religious idea that furnished a reverent refuge for those
minds that rejected the tight-fitting system of Calvin^on^
one hand and on the other the insistence of the estab
lished church that there' must be authority . for truth.
His renovation of the religious idea has striking features
in common with the work of Buddha, in that it "swung
wide the door of eternal hope for all. men. and'estab
lished .1 sort of religious democracy. That it adapted
Christianity to millions of minds that would have re
jected, its preceding forms there â¢ is no doubt... He.
founded an aggressive body with processes that appealed
to all the spiritual impulses of men, and made them as
sume the 'armor and wield the v.-apons of the spirit,
with unselfish devotion and courage. They were the
spiritual warriors of the American frontier. In every
scattered settlement of the pioneers the voice of the
itinerant Methodist preacher was heard, . exhorting in
terms that drew the thoughts of the rugged men and
women of that day to the great issues of life. V
Wesley's follo'wers, zeal unabated and -high,
have done California. the honor. to hold here their great
conference' Their welcome is by r no means limited to
their own communion. The other religious bodies, and
individuals outside of church relations, respect the place
of Methodism in the moral economy of the world/and
extend, to its disciples a California. greeting. . They come
here-to a fair and faultless region, where- nature hangs
her jewels upon the mountains .and flecks the plains
with beauty and color elsewhere unknown.' May, the oc
casion be made memorable above all others. with! the! de
voted men and women who see; here, of nature's crea
tion, a reflection of the graces hoped for in a world that
exists in their faith and is seen of their spiritual vision.
Wells a day or two ago, and during
her stay there received a call, from two
elderly women. Upon entering her
drawing-room to greet them, however,
the authoress was greeted with a hes
itating observation that they had
"called: to see Mme. Sarah Grand."
"That is my name," . replied .the
writer of "The Heavenly , Twins."
Whereupon the visitors explained
that at any rate their hostess was not

believed to be Mme. Grand, though
they admitted that there was a
resemblance. Inquiries on the au
thorees' pa.rt revealed the fact that
while staying at a boarding-house in
Folkestone a woman had represented
herself as "Mme. Sarah Grand" -to
the two old people, and had even
presented them with her' autograph,
copied, apparently, from one of ' the
real Sarah Grand's in an illustrated
magazine.

facilities, and that to send to its classic towers American
students already. partially" instructed in subjects of real
value would be but to expose them to a new and strange^
political. atmosphere and social influence, the harmful
tendencies of which would not be compensated by knowl
edge acquired. - /
; It. may., be justly inquired whether Rhodes made, dili
gent examination into the fitness of Oxford's curriculum
from a pedagogic standpoint before deciding upon the*
endowment he Teft behind him. -From the provisions of
his scholarships it would appear that to his eyes Oxford
is Oxford whether it teaches scansion of the Odes of
Pindar 'or the "strength; of materials, in bridge structures.
It is* the life there, the' influence of centuries, long tradi
tion, the esprit de corps born of association with the fin
est of English-, blood, that Rhodes, judged to '.be worth a
residence of two years there for any American man. \. It
is not, believable that Rhodes expected the establishment
of "a cult of American "digs" and gold medal students,
whose two years should see not' a night when the fever
ish thirst after knowledge did not "outwatch the
Bear." Such would indeed be an innovation for Oxford.
The most ;'. satisfactory construction that can^beput
upon Rhodes' -'scheme for American scholarships is "that
it wasnot for promoting intellectual brilliancy so much
as that of bringing a "corps of promising young men to
Oxford under conditions that would tend to make them
support in after life his . great dream Â¦ of a virtual union
of all English-speaking peoples. For that purpose Ox
ford is as good as any other university would be.

known, came to the Pacific Coast more
than forty years ago. He engaged in
the seafaring business and nine years
later was appointed a pilot His ability
was soon recognized and he came to bo

men of the craft. Countless vessels he
has guided into. port and his fame has
gone afar.
At the time of his death Captain Ott

happy, says Henry Creighton. in a
complaint for divorce filed yesterday
against Olive L. Creighton. He says
that a year after his marriage at Al

conduct that made him most miser
able. He avers that she would visit
places of amusement without him,
take trips to New York alone and re
main away for several and when
he would ask her where she had been
tell him it was none of his business.
He also complains that when she
went out at night she would never tell
him where she spent her time.

ers in the evening. Bishop Hartzell
spoke on "Light for the Dark Conti

The convention will meet for the last
time this afternoon at 1:30 at the Al

The return journey was made
through the north channel by Point

their interesting occupants.
Then the Journey proceded up the

himself behind some veiling clouds, the
afternoon was clear and the Farallones
came distinctly into view.
As the lightship was approached the
University band played "My Country
'Tis of Thee," and cheers went up from
all sides. .- .
Leaving Broadway wharf the Santa
Rosa sailed down inside the Presidio
Shoal and out by Fort Point, across
Point Bonlta and out over San Fran
cisco -bar about six miles beyond the
lightship.
At 1:30 o'clock a party of 600 visitors
to San Francisco and from all parts of
the United States and foreign lands
boarded the stanch vessel, and with the
accompaniment of rousing music by the
University of CaJifornia band, under
the able direction of Bandmaster Jerry
White, the delegates sailed gayly away.
Captain E. Alexander took a course
which as an example the Promotion

DELEGATES GO A-SAILING.
Early yesterday morning the dele
gates to the Missionary Convention of
the Methodist Episcopal church assem
bled in session in the Alhambra Thea
ter and until noon there was a brisk
course of adresscs by prominent men
and one most distinguished . woman,
Mrs. B. H. Badley of India.
The Rev. M. C. Harris, D.D., pre
sided, and after the singing of
the hymn, "Come, Thou, Almighty
Kins," and scripture reading by
the Rev. George Guth and prayer by
the Rev. M. C. Harris.'b. D.. the Rev.
Gideon F. Draper spoke on "The Out
look in Japan." " '
Next came the Rev. E. R. Dllle, D.
D., who related gome plain truths
anent the Pacific Coast and the Orient,
and following Dr. DilU came the Rev.
Homer C. Stuntz, D. D.. who spoke of
"Methodism in the Philippines."
The mÂ«rning session concluded with
the Woman's Foreign Missionary Soci
ety's hour, when an address was de
livered by Mrs. Parker and songs were
rendered by iliss Lucy Leen. who was
escorted by Miss Donaldina Cameron
of the Presbyterian Home.
In the afternoon the delegates went
sightseeing, and one of the most de
lightful trips was given around the bay
and through the Golden Gate, far be
yond the lightship, on the ocean steam
er Santa Rosa,
Captain Andrew J. Dunievy yester
day severed his active connection with
the San Francisco Police Department
after a service extending over thirty
six" years. The officers and men of
Company C, the force attached to the
Harbor Police Station,, of which Dun
levy' has been in command for twenty
years, presented their retiring chief
with a gold watch, chain and locket
yesterday when they bade the veteran
oflicer an official good-by.
Chief of Police. Wlttman, by whose
permission the presentation was made,
attended the captain's, last official roll
c.ill and added his share to the orator
ical tributes paid to Dunlevy's sterling
worth. Acting Lieutenant Cook made
the" presentation.
"I am not an orator," he said, "and
if I, were it woiAd be beyond my power
to give you the credit your service rec
ord deserves."
Captain Dunlevy's retirement takes
from the Police Department one of its
stanchest pillars and from the peace
of the water front one of its sturdiest
preservers. Aggressively honest, Cap
tain Dunlevy's rugged personality has
been a force for good wherever his
duty has taken him. Few men whose
duty calls for the performance of much
that is disagreeable have retired from
the firing line in such universal 'good
esteem as that which Captain Dunlevy
takes with him to private life. A strict
disciplinarian, nobody more regress his
retirement than the men who have
served under his command, and among
those who Joined "most regretfully, in
yesterday's good-by was more than Qne
whose record shows the mark of Dun
levy's exacting insistence upon prop
erly performed duty. Captain Dunlevy
retires with the love of his / brother offi
cers and subordinates and if he has
any enemies he enjoys, at least, their
respect.
Chief Wittman issued an order yes
terday assigning Captain Joseph J.
Burnett to take charge of Police Dis
triet No. 3, which includes the water
f rpnt, and to the command of Com
pany C, vice Captain A. J. Dunlevy;
retired after thirty-six years' service.
Sergeant James T. Donovan is de
tailed as acting lieutenant in Company
A, vice Burnett,' promoted, and Ser
geant William T. Brophy is trans
ferred from Company E to Company
A as patrol sergeant, ; vice Donovan-
Corporal William M. Ross is detailed
as acting sergeant in the district va
cated, by Brophy. !
William Ferguson, having been pro
moted to the rank of corporal, is as
signed to Company E for duty as night
station-keeper at the North End po
lice station, and Policeman Louis J.
Becker is transferred from Company
D to Company C.
When the watch assembled last night
Captain Duke, on, behalf of the squad,
presented Captain Burnett a handsome
floral piece.

Health was held at 641 Merchant street
yesterday afternoon. Dr. Ward, chair
man of a committee appointed to exam
ine new portable sterilizers, .opened the
meeting with his report, to the effect
that all portable sterilizers so far ex
amined have been either too large or
too heavy, which necessitates their be

Shortly after'8 o'clock last evening:
a collision occurred at the junction of
Fillmore and Hayes streets between a
cable and an electric car, both of
which were well crowded with pas
sengers, who fortunately escaped seri
ous injury. Just as the Fillmore-street
car was crossing Hayes an eastbound
car on the latter street was coming
down the steep hill.
Foreseeing the danger of a collision
the gripman . immediately put on his
brakes and turned on his sand box,
but, owing to the slippery condition
of the rails, the brakes were of little
service and his car continued on Its
downward course, finally crashing into
the electric car. The cable car was
thrown off the track , and around
broadside with the electric car. The
windows in both cars were shattered
and the footrail on the left side of the
cable car was wrenched off.
Passengers sitting: inside of both
cars were tossed about and .badly
frightened, while those- occupying
seats on the outside anticipated the
collision by jumping off the cars, a^d
not a few of the latter, including sev
eral young women, were rolled in the
mud. The only injuries sustained wer e
scratches received by those that fell
on the street while scrambling to a
place of safety. - V -

Fu Toda, a Japanese girl, young and,
according to the Oriental idea of beauty,
pretty, has - signalized her conversion
to Christianity by making restitution
to the Government of $20 40 duties on
goods that had been smuggled from
Japan into the United States on her
behalf.
Â¦ 'She arrived on the steamship Korea
on June 9, .1903, with; her brother;" K.
Toda. % He to make the usual
declaration and entry . as- required by
law, and a large quantity of Japanese
goods ~ was found : concealed in his
trunks. :' ;â¢ The goods % were \ seized ' and
confiscated "and Toda was \ convicted of
smuggling 1 * and was sent to Jail. Miss i
Toda .being -, left ; . alone V without^her
brother 'to- protect her, took refuge in
Miss Lake's Oriental Christian Mission,
where ; she became sufficiently ' Imbued
with \ the ! spirit of Christianity \ to feel
that â¢ she ', had a conscience. Not long
ago a locked t^unk was sent to her,
and on opening it she found many ef
fects, Intended, for; herself, all [ of which
were dutiable and. evidently smuggled.
She told' Miss Lake about the matter,
who in turn notified Customs Collector
Stratton, and the trunk was seized.
A report of the affair was transmit
ted to the TreaAury Department, with
the request that the goods be returned
to Miss Toda upon her paying the duty
of $20 40. A reply was received yester
day from R. B. Armstrong, | Assistant
Secretary of the Treasury, granting the
request. The smuggled goods were re
turned to /Miss Toda, and she, who had
been a" benighted heathen, experienced
the .truth of the Christian adage, "Hon
esty is the best policy." '

"Without question the tax rate
will be much lower this year than last
The Assessor Is now collecting the un
secured personal property tax on the
basis of last year's rate. The differ
ence between the rates of that and this
year will amount to considerable, which
the property owners will be entitled to
have refunded to them. This, together
wfth a contemplated raise by. the State
Board of Equalization (unless the.as
sessment roll reaches an amount satis
factory to them), will in Itself require
additional Â¦ labor and extra expense.
It is hoped that these matters will be
carefully considered and provided for
by youV honorable board in the budget
finally adopted. ' â¢ ,, . - Â« -
"It is most', gratifying, to note that
thepark improvement bonds have ma
tured and are being paid, together with
accrued interest, by the Treasurer.. This
will materially decrease the tax levy
for the following fiscal year. '

department so thatit can successfully
fight fires. This will lessen the burdens
of the men incidental to. their -too close
application to. duty, and in the long
run prove a saving to the city.
"I am extremely gratified to be able
to recommend an Increase in the allow
ance of the School Department for sal
aries and Improvements. It should-re
ceive something in; excess of $1,300,000
to conduct its various:, branches and
make sanitary, alterations in numerous
school buildings. It is to be hoped that
the 'bond issue will be brought to a
speedy settlement through the Supreme
Court, so that all their funds will soon
be available.
"I am actuated purely by motives of
fairness in again calling your atten
tion to the justness of the interest de
mands due our merchants on their
claims for the fiscal year 1892-1893. The
Interest will amount to about $100,000,
and .could be met with a 'contingent
provisionâ that to be paid out of the
surplus at the end of the year if the
assessment roll -be more than the esti
mated $450,000,000, as it probably will.
"Since the Supreme Court has upheld
me in my contention that the special
tax for the hospital "and new school
was illegal, it rests with your honor
able board to make provision for re
funding the same to air the taxpayers
at an early date. This will entail con
siderable expense to the city and â¢ an
additional amount of work in this office.
A - suitable appropriation should be
made for this purpose. â¢
REFUNDING EXCESS TAXES.
"To the Board of Supervisors: . In
submitting my budget to your board
for the fiscal year 1904-1905 I feel that I
must renew a few of my suggestions of
last year and call your attention again
to some of the places in the city gov
ernment where conservative uses 'of
public moneys will do .the.', most- good.
It is to be regretted that many of. the
departments cannot be allowed- more
funds to_ enable' them to conduct their
respective offices to the ' best advan
tage. Â¦''
"I have recommended that the appro
priation for the Police Department for
the ensuing year be increased by |150,
000, in order that the police force may
be increased commensurate with the
demands of a fast-growing common-'
wealth.; San Francisco has long since
thrown off/her infancy and is growing
into maturity. The increase in her pop
ulation has been enormous during the
past " two years. This < Increase . has
brought with it an undesirable element,
neither wanted by us 'â¢, nor "conducive to
the : betterment of society. Crime is in
creasing rapidly, and. will continue to
do so unless restrictions -are placed
upon its growth. The city has out
grown its present police force. The in
troduction of the eight-hour law. in the
department has, . of necessity, made . a
demand for 'additional patrolmen and
better equipment. 'It. is a penny-wise-"
and-pound-foollsh 'policy, a saving' at
the spigot, etc., to. neglect adequate po
lice, protection. The impression has
gone abroad that San Francisco is run
ning under the wide-open-town system,
which has invited "here the criminal
element in large numbers. The increase
I have recommended' for this.depart
ment will add a little over one hundred
extra patrolmen, /with'- a~ proportionate
complement of necessary officers and
equipment. â¢ ! '
FIRE DEPARTMENT. " .
"SAN FRANCISCO, April 20, 1904.
Auditor Harry Baehr yesterday .filed
with the Board of Supervisors his esti
mates of the expenditures of the vari
ous municipal departments, aggregat
ing the sum of $6,474,000, for Incorpora
tion in the budget of the next fiscal
year.- Accompanying â¢ the estimate la
an explanatory communication, in
which Baehr calls attention to the neg
ligence of the departments of Works
and Electricity to file their requests In
time. The letter follows:
Welcome A. Botkln, the divorced
husband of Mrs. Cordelia Botkln. died
suddenly yesterday In his apartments
at the Royal House. 126 Ellis street.
At 3 o'clock in the morning; he sum-:
moned the clerk to his room and com
plained of severe pains in the abdomen.
The clerk sent for Dr. A. D. McLean,
who administered the remedies usual
in such cases, and when he left the
room the patient was resting easily. |
At 7 o'clock the clerk \ visited the
room again and found. Botkin dead.
Botkin.was a. traveling salesman for
the meat firm of Armour & Co. of Chi
cago. He took apartments at the Royal
House shdrtly after his wife's arrest on
the charge of poisoning Mrs. John P.
Dunning in Dover. Del., and after he
had learned of the relations of his wife
with John P. Dunning* he sued for a.nd
was granted a .divorce.. He took to
heart very, much the notoriety into
which his wife's conduct brought him,
and it is believed that grief over the
unfortunate affair capped his strong
constitution and prematurely ended his
life. His friends say that he was very
anxious that his wife should secure, a
new trial and ultimately be acquitted
of the murder charge for the sake of
their adult son, Beverly. Mr. Botkln
was 67 years old.
When the case of Mrs. Cordelia Bot
kln. convicted of the murder Â¦ of â¢. Mrs.
Elizabeth Dunning, was called in Judge
Cook's -court yesterday- a request, was
made on behalf of the defendant that Â¦
sentence of imprisonment for . life be
not passed upon her. It was said that â¢
her attorneys had been unable to thor- J
oughly prepare their j argument on a i
motion for a new trial, as the transcript j
of the testimony taken at*the. trial was 1
not yet ready. The- Judge granted a j
continuance till May 9. . She wa? not J
told of the death of . her husband; till ,

in order that his remarks might come

duced by Mr. Sbarboro. After a brief
address, in which he sincerely praised
Rufus P.:Jennlngs for the skillful and

the recent excursion of the Promo-,

on behalf of the committee, an oil

a gold lockef and - watch fob. The
presentation remarks were as follows:
"Early in? this . pleasant month of

a hundred men left San. Francisco un
der the direction of the ICalifornia Pro
motion Committee, making a four days'
excursion through the southern part of
the State, as far; as . San Diego, , and
thence homeward. with short visits of
hospitality and good cheer at. the chief
cities of the coast counties.
- '-'The excursion was,.- designed 'more
for the purpose of Â¦ promoting Â» a new

as a mere pleasure trip; but. It proved
that for Californians pleasure. and pa

spoke with his usual force and elo
quence in response to the toast "The
Importance of Organized Effort in
State Development." The Yolo editor
said in part:
, "The .'extraordinary development we
have, witnessed in the' southern' part
,of the State is the direct result of or
ganized effort. The increase in wealth
and population has been something
marvelous. Speaking for Yolo Coun
ty, we do not envy the south for any
of the prosperity it has achieved. We
admire its pluck, its energy, -its pro
gressiyeness and its public spirit. In
deed, we cannot afford to be sectional
in .our efforts.^ to develop the great
State we all love so well. We are all
Californlans. We are, animated, by
the. same purposes and. inspired by
the. same i motives. We should cultivate

there is so much. to remind us of the

upon us; where the skies overhead are

than whisky that thing is water â and
especially when. used for Irrigation.
"California must extend its irrigat
ed area . indefinitely or soon become
agriculturally a '.finished common
wealth;- Agricultural progress is made
in this State only as 'an additional
acreage of arable land is brought: un
der a certain, .sufficient and definitely
legalized supply, of water for irriga
tion purposes.
"It takes 400 tons of water holding
in solution the earthy elements of
plant food to be sucked from the
ground by the rootlets, pumped up
through the stems and exuded through
the myriad valves of the leaves to pro
duce a single ton of cured alfalfa hay.
It takes more than 300 tons of water
so utilized, without making allowance
for evaporation from th*e ground or
loss by percolation through the sands,
to produce a single ton of cured bar
ley or wheat hay, and there are alfalfa
growing districts in California where,
to cover, seepage and evaporation , as
well .as .plant requirements, an allow
ance is made of 1200 tons of water to
each â¢ ton cured : hay. * Theirs are

no means of knowing ' what the leaf

many times the superficial area of the
ground upon ; which the orchard 1
stands. I have no means of knowing
how much water, orchard trees re
quire in order to * produce a ton of

"Hail California, modern and far out
shining ancient fabled El Dorado! (Ap
plause.) V
will-o'-the-wisp of .fabled riches, never
found El Dorado nor his realm. Their"
greed, unsatisfied, burned out the lives
of many men whose great resources of
head and heart .turned, into other and
more pregnant linesof thought and ac
tion would have made the New World
sooner mistress of the old. And soon,
discouraged by continued failures, it
was accepted by the world at large
that El Dorado was a myth, his land
a figment of disordered brains, his
wealth no better than a dream of ava
riciousness and greed.
"Cabrillo, Viscaino and Sir Francis
Drake came gallantly sailing up the J
eastern coast of the-.mighty Pacific,
landing here and there upon its. shores.
They had given up the hope of taking
captive El Dorado and laying tribute
his riches. And little did the great
freebooter, Sir Francis, dream when
be careened his 'Golden Hind' to pre
pare her for the capture of the treasure
laden galleons from Manila, but a few
miles from where we sit to-night, that
he had set foot upon the land so long
sought, the realm of 'El Dorado, the
Gilded One.' It remained for the hardy
Marshall to unlock the secret place in
which was stored the wealth that le
gend had placed in El Dorado's hands.
It remained for Sutter's millwright to
send abroad the message that brought
to California the men of '49. (Applause.)
It remained for him to open up to us
the land we love so well, our Califor
nia, truly El Dorado's kingdom!
"There Is in all. the history of the
world no more curious verification of
an apparent fable than that of El Do
rado and his kingdomâ California. (Ap
plause.) King Solomon's fabled mines
faded Into Insignificance compared to
the realized wealth of the discovered
Californiaâ El Dorado's realm. Her
fame, undying while the world shall
stand, rested primarily upon the un
told golden millions she so freely gave
to all the world from out the secret
storehouses of her magic soil. But
though she still pours out her annual
millions of the yellow gold in quantities
enough to make â¢ her. were that ; her
only product, still El Dorado's king
dom, her' other -wealth has paled to
comparative insignificance the source
of hVr first name and fame. >Â¦
"No longer do the subjects of our El
Dorado rely entirely for their support
or wealth upon the gold 'that formerly
was our only contribution to the wealth
of nations. For while the patient miner
.wrests from the reluctant hills the
wealth that through him enriches all,
our fertile acres, fattened by the ge
nial California sun, return us other
millions and have made us famous in
another, way.

teacher, for example, who has a new
thought to impart; "the moralist, who
has a new message to preach ; ! the In
ventor, who has a new device to in
troduce; the poet,: who has a new song
to sing; the author, who has a new
story to tell ; the merchant, \ who . has
new. goods to' sell; .the manufacturer,
who has a. new product to market, all
find the widest hearing and the broad
est opportunities in the great city. Â¦â¢ V
"Cities have done much to acceler
ate our civilization, to j stimulate i high
thought, noble action and an'unself
ish spiritl But how are the great
cities maintained. Whence" conies
their support.- What would be their
fateif they should be cut-off from all
communication with the rest of. the
world? "After/all, are â¢they.-not de
pendent, | most dependent; .-' upon the
toilers _living. far from the' city? ' De
stroy every great* city within the , land
and the tillers of the soil would still
live on in more or less comfort and
decency.- . * . - â¢ - -/ :
\ "Wipe out the farm and the^orchard,
the mine - and the forest, the 9 hamlet
and village, and- what. becomes of your
great cities? "Must not the myriadsof
dwellers soon perish for want of bread
and meat, fuel and rainient? Much as
he who follows the plow may , be de
pendent for profit and; comfort- and
convenience upon those who live in
great cities, how infinitely mbre de
pendent i are ; those r who live in the
metropolitan ; centers upon him who
tills the soil, digs in the mine and
wields the ax." (Applause.)
"The beauties, the opportunities and
resources of California are ably de
scribed and illustrated in the official
report of his Excellency Mayor Ed.
des Planches, Italian Embassador at
Washington, and, it may be added, to
such an extent, that, some one might
be Induced to suspect exaggeration.
However, any one who has visited even
a small part of California must admit
that,' although such praise is great,
seldom it overstates the facts, and no
description can convey an exact Idea
of what the country, really is.
"I now take pleasure In presenting
to you our honored Governor of Cali
fornia, George . C. Pardee." (Ap
plause.) \
The dinner dispatched, Chairman
Sbarboro rose to introduce the first
speaker of the evening. In doing so
he took occasion to read from the of
ficial report of his Excellency . the
Italian Embassador to the United
States, whose recent visit to San Fran
cisco is still remembered with pleas
ure by all its citizens. The Embas
sador's praises of California were re
ceived with cheers. Mr. Sbarboro
said in part:
"The California Promotion Commit
tee is highly pleased to see assembled
this evening such a large number of
representative citizens from all parts
of the State, who have come to discuss
at the festive board the welfare of
California. As Italy is the garden of
Europe, so California is the garden
of America. The land of art, song and
poetry sustains over 33,000,000 in
habitants, while the State of Califor
nia, with one-third larger territory,
Â¦with the same climate as that of Italy,
and producing, every shrub, tree and
flower that grows in that sunny land,
has as yet only 1.500,000 inhabitants.
"The time will unquestionaly soon
come when this State, will contain
more people than any other State in
the Union. To expedite this event our
Promotion Committee, which, by the
way, was primarily, organized by that
excellent gentleman.' General Green of
Colusa, is daily disseminating correct

"The estimated total . expenditure for

miss -an opportunity to have compara
tively as much money spent in our
midst, even if we have to subscribe a
substantial part: but itmustbe a
movement of the whole people. About
23,000 stockholders were numbered
among the subscribers at St. Louis. I
speak of this to show how general the
subscription was and how the people
rose to the occasion. . The city of St.
Louis raised 53,000,000 by floating
municipal bonds and J3.000.000 by pri
vate subscription. It may not be neces
sary for San Francisco to raise as
much money as St. Louis. She is pre
eminently located, and with a much
smaller outlay can have an exposition
so different, so unique and at the same
time on so grand a Sc^le that it will
be heralded as a model for generations
to come.
"From $2,500,000 to $3,000,000 would
be comparatively easy to finance In San

know, but fail to act. We want more

A strong wind swept the tennis
courts yesterday and made playing
difficult. The best match was a dou
bles between the Baker brothers of
the Golden Gate Club and Tracy
Crawford and Will Allen. The Bakers
played their usual steady game and
lobbed well despite the wind. Allen
and Crawford were off in their net
work and netted easy kills. The match
was hard fought from start to finish.
The Bakers won by a narrow margin,
taking two sets out of three.
Several good singles matches were
played, in all of which Herbert Long
figured. He lost one and won two.
Long took his brother into camp, but
the latter made an excellent showing,
winning the first set and almost win
ning one of the other three.
Long next took on Merle Johnson.
The latter has not played for several
months, but made Long play his best
to win. Johnson won the last'set and
almost won the second and third.
Long next essayed to beat George
Baker, the park expert, but was too
tired to make any showing against
his cleverer opponent.
.Will Allen and Tracy Crawford
played- an interesting two-set match
in which Allen carried off the honors.
The latter is rounding into form and
will be harfl to beat from now on.

BERKELEY. April 30.â It took the
California-Washington field day meet
on the Berkeley oval this morning to
develop the fact that there is numbered
among the visitors one of the most re
markable athletes of the West. This
hero of the cinder path is Joe Pearson,
crack sprinter in particular and enemy
of records in general. The 100-yard, the
2C0-yard and the 440-yard dashes all
look alike to Pearson, and the marvel
ous thing about it is that he negotiates
them all with consummate ease.
Pearson came heralded as the fast
est man of the Washington track team,
but with records that did not shade
those of such Calif ornlans as Cadogan,
Snedlgar and Abadie. It was taken for
granted he would give all these men a
rub, though not enough to beat them.
When Snedigar just nosed him out in
the 100-yard dash this morning and he
walked away from Cadogan in the 220
yard and 440-yard dashes, besides lop
ping off a fifth of a second in the one
and nearly equaling the other record,
there was a general Bcufrying: to find
words to' fit the case. Even all this
show of speed and skill did not ex-
D. D. L. McGrew, a famous Harvard
stroke, was an interested spectator at
the regatta. He was loud In his praise
of W. H. Dole, the number three of the
Stanford crew. Mr. McGrew has given
the Berkeley men the benefit of his
*,vlde ; knowledge of. watermanship and
they have profited by it.
When . the freshman crews rowed
their races early in the afternoon there
was a strong wind blowing and a chop
py sea on. This disconcerted the Stan
ford men, who , have been accustomed
to i smooth water. Berkeley rowed
completely, away from them, -finishing
a quarter of a mile ahead. The time
was .11:32 'for Berkeley and 13:50 for
Stanford., j
Despite the unfortunate delays the
regatta was a marked success and this

After a consultation it was decided
to send- the boat back Â¦ to the boat
house, where repairs could be effected.
The officials and the spectators settled
down patiently to await the return of
the boat. At 5:45 o'clock President
Wheeler, the- referee, said the race
would be started '. at 6 o'clock with
Stanford and Berkeley as contenders
if Washington did not appear.
The northern crew sent back word
that they could not repair, their boat,
but that they would row the winner on
Monday. This was agreed to.
The two crews then went to the start
ing line. A second start was effected,
hut the race was again stopped, this
time by Stanford.- The stroke of the
cardinal crew broke his oar in the extra
effort required to get the barge in mo
tion. This necessitated a further delay
while a launch went to, the boathouse,
a mile and a half distant, to procure
another oar. v
In the meantime an oarlock on the
Berkeley barge went wrong and had
to be repaired.
A start was finally effected and the
race was on. Berkeley was first away,
as usual, and settled down to a steady
stroke of thirty to the minute, while
Stanford rowed about twenty-eight.
Berkeley had opened up a lead of about
two lengths at the drawbridge, fj The
Berkeley crew were rowing well within
themselves throughout. At, half the
distance Stanford increased its stroke
to thirty-two and gained half a length
on her rivals. As they neared the fin-;
lah the Berkeley men drew away again,
winning by three open lengths. The
mile and a halT, Btraightaway, was cov
ered in 9:58.
The Stanford crew rowed a plucky
race throughout, persevering in the
face . of sure. defeat. After the race
Berkeley was congratulated on her vic
tory, while Stanford was felicitated no
less heartily on her excellent showing.
The Stanford crew was organized only
ten days "ago, and the cardinal coach,
Professor A. W. Smith, formerly of
Cornell, was praised' for what he had
accomplished with the men 1 In that

Intercollegiate rowing was success
fully Inaugurated In California waters
yesterday under most trying conditions.
Through a series of unforeseen mishnps
on the Oakland estuary course the race
between the varsity crews was not
held until nearly 7 o'clock-last evening.
Stanford University and University
of California fought thelivfirst battles
on the water, and the sturdy young
men from 'Berkeley carried off the
laurels.
The crack crew of the University of
Washington did not start, owing to one
of the series of accidents which' de
layed the regatta until dusk. The three
varsity crews lined up early In the
afternoon * and were sent away to a
perfect' start. The crews had pulled
but eight strokes when the Washing
ton men stopped rowing and signaled
that an accident had happened. The
other crewn were called back and, upon
Investigation, it was found that the
sliding seat of the bow bar in the
Washington boat had broken. .
Pearson and Tlbballa of Washington
started against Cadogan, Abadie, Sned
igar and Jones of California in the 100
yard dash. Pearson and Cadogan shot
to the front and stayed, there the first
fifty yards. Then Cadogan began to
fall back and Snedlgar moved up.' Pear
son still had a lead of a foot or two
when Snedlgar 'came up like. a. quarter^

went into the relay and helped win
that event for his college. ,
The feats of the youth Pearson are
all the more remarkable because this
was the first time he had ever raced
on a good track. All his previous trials
were on tracks in his native State that
do not compare even with the rather
slow California track. He is a sturdily
built little fellow, much after the style
of Snedlgar and Abadie. While, in ac

his spurt takes the heart out of his op

Ed Gaylord, the' Denver turfman,
gathered In another purse with Money
Muss in the fifth, a six-furlong spin.
There was such a strong play on Matt
Hogan. the mount of Jones, that the
odds about the "yaJler" horse receded
to 7 to 5. See rode the latter, and
through a powerful. finish kept him go- i
ing long enough to land first In a des- Â¦
parate three-head finish with Matt Ho- Â¦
gan and Louis Wagner.
Johnny Schorr's colt Ananias was re-,
turned winner of the closing seven-fur
long purse run for three-year-olds. '<
Gateway at flrst had the call, but the
Schorr entry later on closed favorite.
The Schorr entry worked his way along
from fifth position, and catching Gate- j
way about all In won cleverly at the
Judges' stand. Jack Little, a 50 to 1 j
shot, ran a close third. j

WALCOTT TAKES HIS DEFEAT
IX PHILOSOPHICAL MANNER
Club Officials Keep Their Word "With
the Great Colored Fighter and
' He Seems Happy.
Joe Walcott was about town yester
day adorned with his usual smile and
seemingly none the worse for his exer
tions of the night before at Colma with
Dixie Kid. He leaves this morning
for Boston, but expresses the hopes of
returning soon to again box the Dixie
Kid. V*.
In speaking of the decision Walcott
said: "Well. I ain't like a lot of fel
lows that come out here and go back
home with a cry of having been rob
bed by a California referee. I must
say the. decision was Just a trifle raw.
but as the papers have all explained
the case. I- think I have lost nothing.
I have received the winner's share of
the purse and so has Dixie. Mr. Coff
roth has kept his word by me and so
everything is all right.
- "The Dixie Kid is all righ.t and he'9
game. He's quick and strong, but Tm
better than he is. He's better than
Woods, but "Woods is harder to hit on
account of his crouch. I want to coma
back again to meet the Dixie Kid. I'd
like to meet Marvin Hart."

the best and the glaring mlscues of tha
Angels made it still worse- to gaze
upon. They commenced their blun
dering . tactics in the first inning.
Whenever the home team got men on
bases more errors were, sure to follow
and this always meant more runs for
Uncle. *
Mr. Flood, the captain and the man
with a Brooklyn training, was the
arch offender. The amiable second
baseman had four marked up against
his name and he deserved every one of
them. He could not stop a ball, nor
could he wing it to a baseman when
he did happen to get it within his
mitts. Toman followed with two and
Spies, Smith and Chase brought up
the rear with one each. They all
proved costly.
Southpaw Jones was the candy after
the first inning. He never allowed the
Angels another look in and did what
he wanted with them. Nobody could
Jilt him. The entire San Francisco
team fielded In grand form. Not an
error "\yas committed and many hard
chances were acepted with much pol
ish and grace.
Hall pitched good enough ball while
his teammates supported him, but as
soon as they fell down it was balloons
with the big fellow. Every one ex
pected to see a batting rally from the
champs, but it never came. After the
first inning the best they got was one
hit. San Francisco accumulated most
of its runs after two men had been
put out. Score:

WASHINGTON, .April 30. â The Sec
retary of the Treasury has issued a
call directing national bank deposi
taries to transfer to the - Assistant !
Treasurer of New York City on or be- !
fore May .10, 1304, an' aggregate
amounting to 112,000.000. The call
on each bank is for 10 per cent of the
public deposit of such bank as it
stood .before the : recent 20 per- cent
call, thus making" a total withdrawal
of 30 per cent of public deposits.^;;
To-day's call, . however, exempts all
depositories whose authorized balance
before the recent call was less than
$100,000. It also exempts a few banks
having active accounts where their au
thorized balance is not greater than
the convenience of the Treasury De
partment in. transacting public busi
ness requires. With these exceptions,
the call applies to all depositories, per
manent and temporary.
In view of the plethora of money in
all the central reserve cities It Is
probable that an additional call of the
same character will be Issued, pay
able about June l.' m This would supply
the amount of the draft - upon the
treasury made, by the of the
isthmian* canal right of- way. and would
afford a working, balance of $50,000,
000 actually, in. the treasury and sub
treasuries as at present. .
Secretaiy of , the Treasury
Directs the Transfer of
Twelve Million Dollars
. "While they may be forced to solilo
quize thus, California owes them a
debt of gratitude. The world - owes
them a debt of gratitude, not alone
for what their Industry added to It in
permanent wealth, but; because from
the rude beginning of the placer miner
a great Industry has arisen and mining
has been taken from the purely specu
lative and placed with the most profit
able, legitimate walks of life."
(Laughter.)
M. E. Dittmar, editor of Mineral
Wealth, was the next speaker, his
toast being "Mining In California."
Mr. Dittmar said in part:
"For the flfty-six years prior to the
discovery of gold in Californiarrâ from
1792 until 1S48 â the United States
produced but S24.7S6.000 in gold; dur-.
ing the flfty-six years that have
elapsed since gold was discovered in
California this State alone has added
to the wealth of the world $1,400,
000.000 in gold, and the greater por
tion of this vast sum is coursing
through the arteries of commerce to
day, providing that ready means of ex
change so necessary in modern com
mercial life. By far the greater por
tion of California's gold output is the
product of the placer mines, or, in!
other words, from the surface. For-.-,
tunes came easy to the placer miners, 1
and in many instances were spent
easy; in bur mountain counties a pio
neer cabin here and there, occupied by
some lonely, pioneer, who dreams of
placer days, "The days of old, the days
of gold, the days of '49,' may now be

"An old Greek said, 'Children should
not be brought, up amidst images of
evil, lest their souls should assimilate
the ugliness of 'their surroundings.'
Brought up in an environment of beau
ty, their souls and their minds will ab
sorb beauty, which enters into their
lives and influences their actions.
Hence, when we want anything beauti
ful or dainty In art. In construction, i*n
cloths, silks and tapestries, we still,
after one hundred years of. American
progress, have to turn to the cities of
the Old World. The Vendome Column
and the Arch de Trlomphe .tell the
Frenchman the story of Napoleon the
Great, just as Strassburg ".Monument,
In the Place de Concorde, tells the na
tional humiliation caused by Napoleon
the Little. In Trafalgar .Square, in
London, every Englishman is reminded
in his daily walk of the glorious death
of Nelson, fighting the battles of his
country, and the Wellington Monument
keeps green the. memory of the Iron
Duke. % â¢
"Should, these lessons be lost? San
Francisco has erected a monument to
Admiral Dewey's victory (applause)
and so long as it stands every passer-'
by will recall with pride the prowess of
American arms, and the city is now
engaged in erecting a monument to the
martyred and lamented McKinley in
order that passing generations may not
forget the lessons of his life and death.
From all parts shall visitors come to
enjoy the hospitality of a city which
has a care for its external appear
ances."
"A city Is a place where people roust,
perforce, live and It should be made
livable and lovable, and then those who
are distant shall seek it and those who
go away Bhajl long to return. When in
Paris I asked a small tradesman why
he did "not bring his wares to New
York, where he would find a larger
market and a more profitable business,
and he looked up in surprise and said:
'Why, I would have to leave my dear
Paris.' New York Is tolerable to the
rich, but It is desolation to the poor. In
Paris every street is a picture, every
park and square is a paradise, every
building is a work of art In walking,
through the city one comes upon mon
uments erected in commemoration of
great men, great events or great ideas,
which exalt the souls of the citizens,
stirs their gratitude and awakens their

NEW YORK,. April 30.â The bank_
statement was the only news with any I
important- bearing on the stock mar- Â¦
ket, and it was accepted with languid I
Interest. This wafkpartly due to the
feeling that the statement was not an
accurate showing of actual conditions.
An Increase, though a small one. In the
cash item of the bank statement in
the week of the largest gold exports
on record is an anomaly in itself.
It is partly explained by the fact that
the statement does not reflect'the J3,
700.000 shipment of gold that went out j
to-day- and which will be carried over;
into next week'* statement Even al- \
lowing for this, the cash reserve is more ,
than $2,000,000 better than was estl- !
mated from the known movements of \
money. Local cash operations' are given ;
as the explanation for the discrepancy. ;
The Increase In the loan item was not |
greater than expected In view of the !
week's railroad Issue of notes. '
V Further issues are expected, and the >
placing of the $37,000,000 New York City }
loan is expected to affect the loan item ;
still further. . It is also generally be- <
lleyed that the outgo of gold up to this .
time, except the Morgan shipment that ]
went to-day, is for. other, purposes than j
the. Panama canal payment, the prln- '
cipal portion of which, .therefore, re- i
mains to be provided for. ... t

Governor James H. Peabody Is de

brief filed before the " Supreme Court
to-day by Attorney E. . F. '. Richardson
in the habeas corous case of Charles
H. Moyer, president of the Western
Federation of Miners, who is held as
a military prisoner at Telluride.
Governor Peabody is compared by
Richardson' to a soldier drunk with
power and his acts in trying to sus
pend the privilege of the writ of habeas
corpus to the acts of tyranny practiced
on the people of England by the olden
kings. . .
Richardson, in his brief, attacks the
decision of the Supreme Court of Idaho
in a similar case and says it is the only
court in the country that has said that
the military was above ,the Judiciary.
He says that the decision does not fol
low precedent or common . sense and
that the Judges of the Supreme Court
of Colorado should not consider It
when deciding the present case.
The-. Legislature alone, Â¦â¢ Richardson
says,. has the authdrity. to ; determine
when the conditions require the eua
pension of the privilege: of habeas cor

ing agents of plaintiff froni freely
moving or operating, its "trains, or any

ties as a â¢ common carrier, also from

LOS ANGELES, April SO.â United
States Judge Wellborn of the District
Court issued . an order this morhms
temporarily restraining the striking
Santa Fe machinists in Barstow,. Sau
Bernardino and The Needles from in
terfering with the new men employed
by the company in place of those Wh*S
have left their employment and enjoin
ing those on strike from hindering in
any manner the operation of the com
pany's train service, its machinery and
all other departments.
â¢ The court declintd to interfere at
this _ time In cases where the strikers
may" seek to induce men to leave^thelr
employment with the Santa Fe, if such
leaving Is the result of persuasion. At
tempts to have the restraining order
cover this subject failed, although â¢ it
was stated in court that when the
question comes up for hearing "on its
merits evidence along that line will be
considered.
Interference With the Work

Will Xot Be Tolerated
Among the raiiroads there is less dis
content than has ever been known be
fore at this time of the year, and; aside
from a possible tie-up "on the New
York, New Haven and Hartford,' the

Industrial education,' a better under

given as reasons for this increased
harmony. *.
NEW YORK, April SO.â According: to
statements made to The Call to-day,
this country is nearer to industrial
peace than on May 1 in any year since
organized labor assumed its present
importance. Within the last few weeks
the difficulty with miners of bitumin
ous coal has been settled and one of the
biggest strikes the world ever saw was
averted.
The condition in the steel and iron
industry, which threatened very seri
ous trouble, has been peacefully adjust
ed within the last week. The lithogra
phers' Quarrel with their- employers,
which kept 1 10,000 skilled workmen idle
for a month, has been settled and the
men are. all at work.
In New York City there is no trouble
In sight. With the recent settlement, of
the bricklayers' . and laborers' dispute
the strike fever seemed to subside and
employers in the building trades and
in most other branches of Industry are
looking forward to at least one year
of uninterrupted business.
Ihcie are but two points wh^'e

last four months, and after being re
vived thia morning she declared that
she would put an end to her existence
at the first opportunity.
The woman was found drunk on the
street two weeks ago," and it being dis
covered that she had abandoned her
three-month-old child it was taken
from her and placed in the custody of
the Associated Charities. Last night
she was again arrested in a drunken
condition, and this morning, shortly
after breakfast, she made her fifth at
tempt at suicide.
The jailer* discovered the woman in

YALE STUDENTS FIGHT
A DUEL WITH FISTS
Footljall Players Use Nature's Weap
ons in Adjusting a Personal
Quarrel.
NEW. HAVEN. Conn., April 30.â In a
secluded spot on the shore of Lake
Whitney, this afternoon, two Yale stu
dents, John XV. C. Leavenworth and
Samuel Alderman, settled a personal
difference with the weapons that na
ture provided. They .pummeled each
other with their fists for twelve min
utes until one of them was forced to
cry quits. All who know of the affair
were to-night trying to hush it up, but
Yale is enjoying a hearty laugh, for
both men are well known.
Alderman has played football. He is
a law student and has aspired to the
middle-weight wrestling championship
of Yale. Leavenworth is a . football
player also, and was halfback and cap
tain of his class team two. years ago.
Leavenworth's. rude'greeting while
Alderman was walking ' with ladies
caused the difficulty. Alderman in
vited Leavenworth to try conclusions
in a physical combat : on the green
across the street. Leavenworth de
murred on the ground that the place
was too public, but offered to meet
Alderman next day.
Promptly at D o'clock this morning
Alderman, with two seconds, whose
names are said to be Anderson and
Eastman, and also a bartender from
the hotel, met Leavenworth and three
student friends.
They agreed to take an early after
noon car for Lake Whitney. They did
so, Alderman and his seconds in .one
end of the car and Leavenworth and
his friends in the other.

KILKENNY'S HEARTY
- GREETING TO EDWARD
Thousands From the Surrounding
. Country Gather to Welcome
the King.
KILKENNY, Ireland, April 30. â
King Edward and Queen Alexandra,
having completed their visit to Dub
lin, arrived here to-day and had the
heartiest reception. The town was
filled with thousands of persons from
the surrounding country.
Replying to an address of the cor
poration, the King spoke of his grati
fication at the fact that his deep Inter
est in the Irish people was recognized.
Both the Queen and himself would re
joice to see Ireland take that place in
the industrial world which the intelli
gence and 'deftness of h'er people
amply qualified her to fill. If his visit
gave him better acquaintance with the
neds of the people and convinced them
of his kindly feelings, he would be
amply repaid.
BUILDING OPERATIONS
HEAVY '.'DURING APRIL
$2,101,488 and Surpass Those of
Any Previous Month.
Projected Improvements Aggregate
The Bureau of Buildings Issued per
mits during April for 220 new build
ings at an estimated cost of $1,937,856
and for, 72 alterations to old structures
costing $163,632. This represents an
aggregate , expenditure of $2,101,488
and surpasses any one month in the
history of the office for building opera
tions. -In' March the sum expended
was $1,507,000. .
.There were also 182 free -permits
issued where the expenditure was less

The Southern Pacific Railway will
shortly change its local passenger
service between Oakland, Alameda
and Berkeley from steam cars to
up-to-date, electric trains. Work is
already under way. Another bridge
Is being built across the north
arm of the estuary at First
street and a double track is to be laid
so as to make a twenty-minute ser
vice possible. This is the beginning, of
the change which' will only stop with
the conversion of >the entire system
from steam to electricity.
A number of prominent Southern Pa
cific railroad officials made a tour of in
spection, of the company's lines on this
side of the bay to-day. The purpose of
the visit, as given out, was to intro
duce C. H. Markham, the new general
manager, and Charles S. Fee, the new
passenger traffic manager, to the lines
and properties here. In the party, be
sides these two, were William Sproule,
freight traffic manager; W. S. Palmer,
division superintendent, and Al Baker,
assistant division superintendent. Be
sides showing Markham and Fee over
the ground, however, the changes and
benefits to be derived from them were
the chief subject of discussion.
By one of the members of the party
it was afterward stated that the
change to electricity was a matter of
course; that it was the;, only logical
thing to be done and that the plans
were being drawn up and perfected.
Further; it was stated that the change
would be complete. The new line will
not be an overhead trolley, but a mod
ern third rail road with heavy cars.
With- the inauguration of the twenty
minute service the trains which now
stop at Fruitvale will run on to Sather
and it is expected will give an impetus
to the building up of this section of
tha country. It is .expected that within
the year the changes talked of will
have become realities. v*'v

Three orders presented to County
Auditor Bacon for 'Constable Ed Weid
ler's April salary by different persons
has developed the fact that he has col
lected his month's pay three times in
advance while he already had it hy
pothecated up to July, 1906, to other
persons.
James P. Taylor, Sol Kahn and
Fred Porch each presented an order
for the Constable's April salary. They
were told that there were others ahead
of them. '
In the absence of Auditor Bacon to
day Chief Deputy Myron Widden made
the following statement: "Three .dif
ferent people have presented orders for
Â¦Weidler's April salary. James P. Tay
lor was in yesterday, and, drawing out
an order signed by Weidler for $150,
asked me if It was any good. I told
him that It was not, as the salary was
already hypothecated for two years in
advance, and I told him not to take
any more of them. He said he .would
look out for that.
"Sol Kahn was In the day before,
and I told him the same thing, and he
said: "Well. I give him just twenty
four hours to settle with me.' Fred
Porch, proprietor of the Macdonough
saloon, had another. v-y..'.
"Â¦Weidler's salary has been tied up
a lonur time by Attorney Ben Woolner
and Charl-s J.'Heeseman, while others
have been trying to get in on the
money, but find themselves shut out.
I have tried to tide him over his em
barrassment, but it has gone out of
my hands now. Last month it was
the same thing, and there were four
or five people with orders for his
March pay.
"While he only receives J1L0 a month
from the county, Weidler's fees bring
him in as much more. Still he has
been collecting money right and left,
and it is only a question of time before
he runs up against the wrong man."
The same story is told at the Treas
urer's office, and surprise is expressed
that Weidler has gone as long as he
has, for it is stated that this is no
new thing, and that people from every
part of the county have been taken
in in the same way.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, April SO.
In speaking of the matter District
Attorney Allen said that at first glance
it looked to him as if Petray was en
titled to his salary, but he would not
cay positively until he had looked the
law up in the matter.
* Th* case is of interest to every
teacher in the State.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
. . HIS Broadway. April SO.
The Question of whether a school
teacher is entitled to salary while ab
sent from echool en account of sick
nes* Is cne that has been passed up to
,the District Attorney for his opinion.
..n. C. -Petray, principal of the Hay
: wards School, was away from his du
ties for the entire month of last No
vember. The trusteesâ G. S. Langan,
A. J. Dean and J. A. Obermullerâde
cl<!ett to pay him his money for the
month, but the warrant was held up
by Superintendent Crawford, who
holds 'he Is not entitled to the salary-
P'etray has been several months trying
'\o collect the money, and the matter
has finally been passed up to District
Attorney Allen for his opinion. Craw
ford pays that if the District Attorney
so .orders he will pay Petray his war
rant. * .
Petray takes the ground that *no
county official would lose his salary if
be were absent from his office for the
eiftlre term. Employes of large firms
and corporations do not generally dock
thÂ«*ir men for unavoidable absences on
account of the ills flesh is heir to. and
he. dees not see why the State should
enforce a cheaper method with Its
public school teachers.

Demise of Charles T. Finley.
OAKLAND,.A.pril 30.â Calvin B, Mac-
Donald, a pioneer, editor and at one
time one of the most prominent Jour
nalists of the Pacific Coast, died -this
morning at the County Infirmary at
the age of 80 years. The deceased had
been in poor health for a number of
years, and entered the infirmary on
August 2, 1902. ' â¢Â¦ 'Â¦,;>- <'- -Â¦>'Â«'
Calvin B. MacDonald was. born l:i
Pennsylvania, and came to California
during the rush of gold seekers to the
Pacific Coast. He first came into prom
inence as editor of the Mountain Mes
senger of Downieville, but after the
outbreak of the Civil War he became
an editorial writer on the American
Flag, then published in Sonora, Tu
olumne County, by McCarthy Broth
ers. â¢ i* ''cl'^/rid'"*] â¢
. Soon after his advent as air' editor
of the American Flag that paper was
moved from Sonora to San Francisco,
and It was there that Mrl MacDonald
made his reputation as a writer of
forceful, patriotic editorials, his writ
ings gaining for him the nickname of
'â¢The Terrible Thunderer."
During the later years of his life he
was engaged on various papers on the
coast as an editorial writer, and while
thut\ engaged he made many bitter
attacks on. the Central Pacific. Rail
road, the California Bank of San Fran
cisco and other corporations.
Domestic troubles led him to dissi
pate heavily, and the closing years of
his life'. were spent in poverty. His last
home in Oakland was with Mrs. Sarah
Shields at. 608% Fifteenth street.
After his retirement from active
work as a journalist Mr. MacDonald de
livered a number of lectures, two of
which are well remembered in this
city. The subjects of these were "The
Massacre of Glencoe" and "Thirty
Years on the Border," the latter being
a history of his own experiences In Cal
ifornia and Oregon. \ \
The funeral will be held under the
auspices of the Oakland Press Club
on Monday or Tuesday afternoon.

HAWAIIAN NATIONAL GUARD
MAY GO OUT OF EXISTENCE
Governor Carter Recommends Dis
pensing With It So as to Cut Dorm
Government Expenses.
HONOLULU. April 30. â Consider
able discussion has be-en aroused by
the proposal to dispense entirely with
the Hawaiian National Guard In fol
lowing the general plan of cutting
down Government expenses. The
message of Governor Carter to the
special session of the Legislature
showed that the island Government Is
about $600,000 behind as a holdover
debt of the past two years and that
the present period appropriations ex
ceed the Income by $1,500,000. Car
ter presented a plan of rigid economy
to make, matters even. He recom
mended dropping the militia.
The National Guard has received
considerable aid from the Federal
Government, as well as moral support,
and regular army officers who have
visited here have urged improving its
efficiency. It was formed after the
overthrow in 1893 and now consists of
about 450 men, a majority of them
Hawailans.
Another cutting out proposed Is that
of the Government band. This is the
famous old royal Hawaiian band,
which has been in existence more than
thirty years. Carter recommended
dropping the appropriations for thÂ«
salaries of its members, but there Is
much opposition to its being given up.
Carter's recommendations, embodied
In two appropriation bills, were passed
on first reading on the first day of the
session in both houses. Under the
plan proposed the Territory will pay
off about a hundred thousand dollars
a year of its debt Instead of Increas
ing it.
OAKLAND, April SO.â Favored of
many brides, April drew to a close to
day amidst the triumphant music and
merry wedding bells of two of the pret
tiest marriage fetes of the year. At St.
John's Episcopal Church this after
noon the Barry-Clay wedding took
place and a brilliant gathering filled
the little church from entrance to al
tar-rail. '- : 'Xl.
Miss Edna Barry that wasâ now Mrs.
Phillip Clayâ is an unusually attract
ive girl, with great dark eyes, and she
never looked more charming than in
her bridal white to-day. Her. gown was
a triumph of the dressmaker's art in
ivory white satin and tulle. From the
waist to the knee French folds of the
two materials alternated and below a
fitted flounce, draped with tulle and
lilies-of-the-valley, fell in graceful
folds and swept away into the long
train. A deep yoke and berthe of rare
duchesse and point lace adorned the
satin bodice. A cluster of lllles-of-the
valley held the veil in place and a
shower of the same delicate flowers
formed the bridal bouquet.
Miss Jane Barry officiated as maid
of honor and her dress of white lace
was exquisite. The lace was of the
pattern so popular Just nowâ a silk
braid applique on Brussels netâ and it
â¢was made over a fluffy underdress of
white chiffon and silk. Ousters of
small, white chiffon roses were used
as. pendant ornaments on both skirt
and bodice. A white picture hat of
chiffon and roses and a shower of pink
Bridesmaid roses completed a very
striking and becoming costume.
Miss Madeline Clay was first brides
maid and she and the other attendants
âMisses Letitla Barry. Margaret Sin
clair, May Coogan and Marion Good
fellowâwere gowned alike In pink silk
point d'esprlt over chiffon and silk of
the same color. "1..
Each eown was trimmed with white
roses, which also adorned the big pink
chiffon hats wom. Each girl carried
an armful of white roses and tulle.
The ushers were Herbert Barry, Ar
thur Gelsler, Moulton . Warner, Alfred
Plaw and Aaron Brock. The groom
was attended by Robert Bain Jr.
Rev. Edgar Gee, pastor of St. John's,
was the officiating clergyman.
After the ceremony at the church a
reception was tendered the bridal
party and a few inltimate " friends at
the home of the bride's parents on
Adeline street. The residence . was
tastefully decorated with a profusion
of white roses and the newly wedded
pair stood In a bower of bamboo and
roses while receiving the congratula
tions of the assembled guests.
The wedding of Mr. Clay and Miss
Barry has been one of the chief topics
for some time, as both are members
of well-known and pioneer families of
Oakland. The bride is one of three
very charming daughters of Mr. and
Mrs. Edward Barryâ the former being
a prominent stockbroker In San Fran
cisco. Philip is the son. of Major and
Mrs. C. C. Clay and Is a Junior part
ner in the music firm of Sherman, Clay
& Co. He was graduated from the
University of California with the class
of '02 and" is a v member of the Phi
Gamma Delta Fraternity and of. the
University Club. ;,
. After a honeymon of two or three
weeks" duration Mr. and Mrs. Clay will
make their home temporarily In
Blythedale until their own house on
Stelner street, San Francisco, is ready
for occupancy.

the police should be notified and ac
cordingly Director Hayden was asked
to send a detective to the hotel. De

the Central police station, where it
was opened by the director.
Inside the brown wrapping paper was
found a dynamite cartridge weighing
two and one-half pounds. The car

Uc at S4%c An active commission house
demand, however, coon developed with shorts
free buyers of May. In consequence the May
option sold up about a cent while July- ad
vanced V~c. The leading factor In bringing
out the Improved demand was the almost sen
sationally bullish ctod news . from . the Ohio
Valley. Local traders who have had an op
portunity of viewing fields - In that section
during the cast week found It difficult to
express the extent of the damage. Reports
from such sources had much to do with the
generally bullish sentiment of. pit traders.
Another strengthening Influence was a good de
mand for the cash article here and In the
Northwest. Probable delay In the opening of
navigation owing to strikes tended to strength,
en the situation, at with a supply of. whtat
from Duluth cut off there would be a better
demand â¢ here. Late weaknesn In corn and a
desire on the part of a few holders to take
profits over Sundav checked - the advancing
tendency, but the close was/ firm and 'near

Longworths sold at a wider range of prices,
but cleaned up well. A crate of Raspberries,
containing 18 small baskets, came In from Los
Angeles and sold at 35c per basket.
Trade in Citrus fruits was very quiet owing
to the cool. . cloudy weather, and there was
very little doing In the shipping line. Sound
offerings of fancy Navels were held at rather
firm prices, while inferior stock, which con
stituted the bulk of the receipts, was being
pressed for sale at unsteady rates. A note
worthy feature of the market for tropical
fruits was the arrival of five crates of Cuban
Pineapples.' which met with prompt- sale at
$3@5 per. dozen as to size. The receivers
stated that a carload of the fruit was on the
way to this market and was expected toward

to weaken. ,New Red from the river, were of
fering in small quantities and sold slowly at
2c per pound.

were obtained from the regular Â¦ trade for the
best stock. Rhubarb and Peas continued weak,
with supplies far in excess of requirements.

NEW WESTERN ADDITION BLOCK.
$1650 TO $1S5O.
EASY TERMS.
LOTS 83:4x120.
Encouraged by the rapid sale of the block re-
cently placed on the market in the Jordan
Tract, the. owner, Mr. J. C. Jordan, has In-
structed us- to offer the half block to the east,
facing on Jordan avenue, on exactly the same
terms and conditions as governed the aale of
the first block. The large lota and the build-
Ing restrictions have proven to be a great suc-
cess among those who contemplate building de-
sirable homes.
Have you seen the property? The land Is
being aold In exceptionally large lots, 33:4x120.
I at tha extremely low pricea mentioned above.
Terms are one-fifth cash and the balance In
four yearly paymenta of one-fifth each with
the privilege of paying faster. Building re-
strictions have been placed on this property
which make it posalble for you to build a home
or two flats without being damaged by neigh-
boring buildings. These restrictions prohibit
the use cf the land for atores. coal yards,
laundries, etc. Three-story flats are alao pro-
hibited.
We have sold 16 lota In this block to people
who will make exceptionally good improve-
ments. This Is the only block In the city where
you can buy a large lot. where all the lots are
large and all the. improvements good. This
plan haa succeeded in all of the large cltlea In
the East and the rapid sale of this land proves
that it Is In favor here. Prices range from
$5^ 60 to $55 00 a front foot, which Is ex-
tremely low for property eo well situated.
Take our advice and see the land at once.
It can be reached by the Sacramento and Eddy
street lines besides the Geary and Sutter etreet
lines. The new California electrio road which
will take the place of the steam dummy will
pass the property. Make haste, and aee the
land at once, as it Is going fast.

steamer Despatch and in j tow of that
vessel started yesterday afternoon -for
this port. The tug Sea Rover left here
yesterday to meet and assist the Dis

tain Dcm-llng, arrived yesterday after
a long and stormy passage from New
castle, Australia. She brought ~2170
tons of coal, the temperature of which
was kept within the safety limits in
spite of the length of time it was in
the hold and notwithstanding that the
bad weather made the necessary ven
tilating an .operation of considerable
difficulty. The Sea King left New
castle January 9 and for the first three
weeks of the voyage battled with
easterly gales. She crossed the equa
tor 74 days out in longiture 156 west.
In latitude 28 north, longitude 172 west,
the Sea King encountered three days
of northeasterly Â¦Â¦ gales, during which
several sails were blown away. The
passage occupied 112 days. (
Sea King's Long Voyage.
The Theodor arrived here March 8
from Rotterdam after a long and
stormy passage. Unable to round
Cape Horn, she changed her course
and came by way of the Cape of Good
Hope.
The Norwegian ship. Theodor narrow
ly escaped serious damage, if not de
struction, yesterday afternoon, by
drifting ashore on the northwestern
extremity of Goat Island.
The Theodor was at anchor off Lom
bard-street" wharf,- ready" to sail for
Puget Sound. She is in ballast and her
high sides offered a substantial sur
face to the brisk nortnwester which
tore her away from her anchorage and
gradually forced her' along, in spite
of her mud hook's grip on the bottom,
tp the rocky shore of Yerba Buena.
Superintendent William Manning erf
the Spreckels Towboat Company was
the first on shore to note the Theodor'3
danger and he promptly dispatched the
tugs Dauntless and Reller to the ves
sel's assistance. The tugs got along
side the helpless windjammer not a
moment too' soon. The tradjtion-worn
biscuit, thrown with ordinary dexterity
from the Theodor's deck, would have
landed high and dry on the steep slope
of the island. As usual under such
circumstances, . however, nobody
thought of throwing the hardtack and
in a few minutes after the tugs had
got alongside there was a satisfactorily
wide stretch of water between the
Theodor and Yerba* Buena's rocky
beach. ; ' , '
The vessel was towed to a more shel
tered anchorage and securely heoked
to the mud." v

Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL' BUREAU, HOTEL BARTON,
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 30.âPro
fessor Alexander Graham Bell of this
city, who is seeking to solve the prob
lem of aerial flight, gave a public ex
hibition to-day of tetrahedral kites.
The exhibition was given at the re
quest of the National Geographical So
ciety, of which Professor Bell .was
founder, and took place on a high pla
teau on the Virginia side | of the Po
tomac, within sight of Washington,
where the Weather Bureau has its kite
station.
Professor Bell explained that In pre
vious experiments with other forms of
kites it had been demonstrated that
when a kite was made large enough
to sustain the weight of a -man who
might steer it and an .engine which
might propel it, the structure was too
heavy to fly.
Professor Bell gave . various experi
ments. One kite consisting of sixteen
cells, the weight of which was only
two and three-quarters pounds, was
flown at a great height and maintained
considerable steadiness In a " light
breeze. In what seamen know as a
fair sailing breeze this fragile fabric
would have lifted into the air a weight
of seventy-five pounds.
Aluminum-framed kites also were
flown, and, although the lightness of
the air currents was rather against
a succesful demonstration, all present
were convinced that Professor Bell
had made a great 6tep forward In the
line of his experiments. He will con
tinue working out the problem at 'his
college in Braddock this summer.
. The required reserve was .augment
ed by, $1,248,350 through the increase in
deposits. Deducting from this sum the
net 1 " gain ; In cash left $1,059,450, as the
decrease' in, surplus .reserve to $33,
144,250., Computed upon, the basis of
deposits less those of $56,252,700 ' public
funds, the surplus is $47,197,425.
was a discrepancy of $1,064,300 be
tween the estimated and the actual
change in cash. Deposits also showed
a net. high^ record in an increase of
$4,995,400/ or $1,558,000* more than the
amount called" for by the sum b"f in
crease in loans and the. net gain * in
cash, consequently the statement did
not balance.
NEW YORK, April 30.â The Finan
cier says: Notwithstanding the export
during last week of more than $12,750,000
of gold to Paris, the official statement
for the week of the New Vork Asso
ciated Banks showed a net Increase of
$188,900 cash, and the surplus reserve
was reduced' by only little mor.2 than
$1,000,000. Even under the averag." sys
tem of the Clearing-house banks the
shipments pt gold fÂ« ; r the week should
have, it would seem, shown a loss of
nearly $8,500,000 of cash.
Tuesday's exports of $6,500,000 called
for the whole of that amount because
the withdrawals were made early in
the bank week; Thursday's exports of
$2,500,000 for one-half of this sum, and
Saturday's I export of nearly $4,000,000
for one-sixth of the amount, the total
of these averages making $8,500,000, as
above. Inasmuch as the remainder of
the amount exported, or $4,500,000, was
carried over under the average system
into the .current week, the statement
was clearly- made on largely declining
averages for cash.
â¢ .Loans-were expanded through cor
poration borrowing by $3,246,500, car
rying this item to a new high record.
Cash ' increased $188,900 net, the
specie decreasing $961,000 and legal
tenders being augmented by $1,149,
0 0 0. It may ; be noted that the re
ports which .were based on the trace
able movements of money during the
week - exclusive Saturday's 'ship
ments of gold to Europe indicate a
loss of $876,400 cash: therefore there
TACOMA, Wash., April SO.â A diary
kept by Â¦ Bob Taylor, the hermit cap
tured yesterday after a "battle with'- a
Sheriff's posse, makes it appear that he
has. killed others since February," 1903.
One entry, undated, reads: "To-day I
killed 'feller' Killon and " The last
word is uninteligible. The . sentence
may mean "I killed a fellow,". and' the
rest may. refer to killing and shooting-.
The belief is growing that the pris
oner is the missing Taylor of Lena.
County, Missouri, who, after murder
ing several persons for which he -was
sentenced to be hanged in 1896, es
caped and disappeared, and for whom
heavy rewards were offered.
Long life as a hermit may / have af
fected his mind, for there is said to be
no doubt that he is partially demented,
and fear of capture may have led to
his deadly assault on the two tramps
who applied at his cabin for shelter
and his subsequent attempt to kill
Sheriff Dcnholm and his deputies.
AUBURN, April 20.â John Long, a
pioneer of the mining town of Forest
Hill, was found dead in his cabin a
couple of -days ago. Coroner Shepard
held an inquest and during a prelimin
ary search of the cabin found $35 in
small change scattered about. A later
and more extended search has resulted
in a ' ii nd 'of nearly, $1000 in gold.
The peculiar circumstance is that the
money was hidden and buried , In all
parts of the cabin and cellar. Not more
than $20 was found in one place. This
is not an. unusual custom among min
ers. It is doubtful if Long knew the
location of all his money himself.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
San â¢â¢Francisco's first Pure Food and
Industrial Exposition was formally
opened by Mayor Schmitz last evening
in the Mechanics' Pavilion, and a large
audience applauded his eulogy of the
enterprise and good wishes for its suc
cess. The ceremony was brief and sim
ple, 6ut at its conclusion the crowd re
sumed inspection of the exhibits that
cuver the entire ground area of the big
building.
Almost everything that is handled by
a first-class grocer is to b^ found in
the show, and there are some things
that have no connection whatever with
the food question, but are attractive,
just the same. Several wide-awake
manufacturers cf vehicles and other in
digestible articles and a few energetic
hicicwhow men have taken advantage of
the-advertising opportunity afforded by
the display of comestibles, and the way
in which the foreign attractions were
patronized last night showed that no
mistake was ma'de in admitting them.
To describe all the exhibits that come
fairly under the title of the exposition
Trould be a stupendous task. Suffice it
to cay that they are sufficiently numer
ous and varied to keep the visitor inter
ested for a couple of hours at least.
Each booth is tenanted by obliging
clerksâ mostly of .the gentler sex-^who
eloquently describe the particular vir
tues of their- respective commodities',
and almost every exhibitor ' gives each
caller a souvenir, either a sample of
the exhibit or an attractive advertise
ment of^it. By the time the visitor has
completed his tour of â¢ the hall j he is
heavily laden with packages and print
ed matterâ or if he isn't it is I his own
fsrult. .Then tea and coffee and choco
late and cocoa and various kinds of
mineral waters and other innocuous
beverages are to be had for the asking.
Persons desiring more ardent liquids
can be accommodated without leaving
the building.*. . -^ /

Brooklyn Leader at Head of
the Democratic Executive
Committee in Ne^v: York
ALBANY, N. Y., April 30.â At a meet
ing of the Democratic State Commit
tee here to-day Cord Meyer of Queens
Borough, New York City, was elected
chairman to succeed Frank Campbell,
and State Senator McCarren of Brook
lyn was made chairman of the execu
tive committee.
Edgerton L. Winthrop of New York
was chosen Presidential Elector in
place of Robert B. Roosevelt, who de
clined to serve owing to the fact that
President Roosevelt, the probable Re
publican nominee for President, is his
nephew.
Prior, to the meeting ot the commit
tee It was reported that while the Tam
many men would not object to the se
lection of Meyer as chairman of the
State committee, they did urgently ob
ject to Senator McCarren as chairman
of the executive committee. It was
said that Charles F. Murphy, leader of
Tammany Hall, would be placed on the
executive committee, but Thomas F.
Smith "of New York, who held Mur
phy's proxy.- said he did not believe
Murphy would consent to . serve upon
a committee headed by McCarren.
Former Mayor Hugh J. Grant .of New
York City and former I*ieutenant~Gov
ernor W. F. Sheehan of Buffalo were
among those elected to the executive
committee. Grant being- selected Instead
of Charles F. Murphy.
