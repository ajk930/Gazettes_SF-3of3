Official Report of
Port Arthur
Battle.
Viceroy Believes
Enemy's Ships
Were Hit.
ST. PETERSBURG, Feb. 18.â A
long official dispatch from Viceroy
Alexiefl, recounting the details of the
fight of February 9 at Port Arthur,
was piven out to-day. It enumerates
the Russian casualties and says it is
known that a number of Japanese
ships suffered severely, which accounts
for their not following up the attack.
The Viceroy's dispatch Is dated Feb
ruary 18 and says:
"After the night torpedo attack the
Japanese fleet, consisting of sixteen
warships, appeared at 10 o'clock in the
morning off Port Arthur. Its appear
ance was noted by the coast eigrnal
station "as" well -as by the'ships of our
squadron, which lay in' the outer road
stead fully prepared for battle. Our
squadron consisted of five battleships.
f5ve first and second class cruisers and
fifteen torpedo boats, under the com
mand of Vice Admiral Stark and Rear
Admiral Ukhatomski. The coast bat
teries immediately prepared to re
ceive the enemy. Our " squadron
neighed anchor in order to give battle
and upon the first shot being fired by
the enemy the fleet and batteries re
plied simultaneously with a lively can
nonade. The most expoped to th?
enemy's f.re were the ships of the
squadron, battery No. 15 on Electric
Cliff, and battery Xc. 13 on Golden
Hill. Other coast batteries, principal

"ENEMY'S WARSHIPS HIT.
"Throughout the fight the torpedo

cabletari (a Russian sea measure),
awaiting orders.
"The land batteries were under the
general direction of Major General
Kaloff, commander of the Kwantung
garrison of artillery. It is still,* diffi
cult to ascertain the result of the bat

by our chips it may be assumed that
several vessels of the enemy's fleet
sustained damage, which explains why
they avoided further fighting, although
they were much superior to us '. In

TOKIO, Feb. 18â There waa great
rejoicing here last night over Admiral
Togo's official report of the successful
attack on Port Arthur on Sunday, Feb
ruary 14. All of the Japanese news
papers issued extras, giving the full
text of the report. > V^
The Japanese torpedo flotilla, which
was ordered to make the attack, got
separated in a severe snowstorm on
the way to Port . Arthur. Only two
boats, the liayatory and the Asaglrl.
managed to i reach their destination
early on Sunday morning. The Asa
giri, under the guidance of Commander
Ishlkawa, reconnoitered the waters
about (he entrance to the harbor, and.
paying . no attention* to the vigorous
fire directed upon It by the forts and
scout boats, succeeded in , torpedoing
one warship.
When the Hayatory In charge - of
Commander Takencuchi arrived it
steamed close enough to the Russian
vessels to recognize two warships.
Discharging a torpedo at one of these
ships. Commander Takenouchi waited
until he saw the Russian ship blow up.
He then returned safely, without
slightest damage.
LONDON, Feb. 18.â The Japanese le
gation here received an official dispatch
from Tokio to-night, saying it was not
true that any Japanese vessels had
been destroyed so far in any of the
various naval â  engagements and that
all necessary repairs had already been
made. The Japanese fleet remains in
tact.
This message also .denies the report
that the Japancst were driven from the
neighborhood of Kir.chow after a skirm
ish In which 150 Japanese were taken
prisoners, and declares that the Jap
anese made no attempt to land at
Pigeon Bay. It says the Japanese
forces "up to the present time have
made no attempt to land at any point
where they would come in contact with
the Russians, and that consequently all
reports of land actions and Japanese
losses are untrue.

WRECKERS MAY
SAVE FULTON
Steamer Lies on the Beach at
Port Orford Where She Can Be
Reached During- Low Tide
MARSHFIELD, Ore.. Feb. 18.â The
first authentic news regarding the wreck
of the lumber-laden steamer Fulton,
â which went ashore at Port Orford on
last Thursday, was received here to
n'ght.
The steamer was short of coal and
had anchored in Port Orford harbor,
where she hung for two days. The
wind finally broke her anchor chains
and her master, Captain Lee, seeing
hope of saving her was lost, headed
the Fulton for the beach, where she
struck bow on. After striking she
brought to and the seas began to sweep
her deck.
A beat was sent away from her in
command of Second Mate Ingleson and
manned by two sailors to take a line
to the shore, but the 1>oat was cap
sized by a piece of lumber which had
broken from the Fulton's deckload and
Ingleson was drowned.
The sailors clung to other pieces
from tho deckload and were carried to
the shore, where they were picked up
in an exhausted condition. A drift with
a line attached was finally floated
ashore and the rest of the crew were
rescued on the life raft, two at a time.
The Fulton now lies high on the sea
wall and can be reached at low tide.
It is believed she can be saved In fair
weather.

REDDING, Feb. 18.â It is believed
that the fate of the unknown man
who passed down the storm swollen
Sacramento River Monday night on a
log has been determined. A body has
been found in the drift near Red Bluff.
Where the man came from or how he
got into the predicament that ended
fatally to him is unknown. Much in
di.trnation is expressed here that the
people of the villages north of here
who saw the man and heard his cries
for help did not telephone Redding at
the time. The unfortunate's life might
have been saved here.

whether Mrs. Florence Maybrick will

whether the Secretary will announce
the grounds for her release, said:
"There can be no general rule ap

PROPOSES TO RESTRICT
RIGHTS OF THE JEWS
Commission Now Sitting at St. Peters
burg Recommends Enforcement
of Stringent 'Regulations. â 
LONDON, Feb. 18.â The St. Peters
burg correspondent of the Jewish
Chronicle says the commission now
sitting at St. Petersburg charged with
the revision of the laws In force against
the Jews proposes to recommend that
in ten provinces of Poland, where
hitherto Jews have enjoyed unrestrict
ed rights, these rights shall now be re
stricted in every respect to conform to
the regulations obtaining within the
"pale of settlement."
Under this ruling Jewish merchants
and professional men will be deprived
of the right to employ Jewish clerks
as assistants. As it is almost Impos
sible for Jewish merchants to carry on
their business without Jewish clerks
and assistants and as more than half
a million Jews reside outside the "pale
of settlement," few of whom if these
restrictions were enforced could re
main, it is believed that an unex
ampled emigration of Jews will result
if the recommendations of the commit
tee are put into effect.

CLOVERDALE'S TWELFTH FAIR
ECLIPSES ITS PREDECESSORS
Display of Citrus Fruits "Again Demonstrates Sonoma County's
-Ability to Compete With Any Other Section_x)f .California in
the Raising of Those Products â Varied and Unique Exhibits
CLOVERDAIiE, Feb. IS.â With the
formal opening of its twelfth annual
citrus fair this evening Cloverdale in
augurated a season of carnival which
will continue until next Monday night.
There are many strangers in. town,
and it is confidently predicted that be
fore the fair closes at least 5000 visit
ors will i$*2,ve been entertained. .The
California" Northwestern^ Railway and
the stage lines of three counties have
made special reduced rates for those
who desire to attend the festival.
In every essential to attractiveness
this fair eclipses the best of its prede
cessors. The demand for space in the
pavilion has been more than the man
agement could comply with, even by
holding each exhibit down to the mini
mum, and as a result there are some
disappointments among those who
had prepared displays and are unable
to get them placed. This pressure has
had ths compensatory result, however,
of determining the board of directors
to enlarge the building to double its
present area for the fair of 1905.
All the exhibits were not ready for
the opening, of course, but the princi
pal ones were completed, and to-mor
row the last of the lot will have re
ceived its finishing touches. Every
available inch of the floor area is oc
cupied with the most varied exposition
of Sonoma County's horticultural re
resources on record. While citrus fruits
â oranges, lemons and pomelosâpre
dominate, there are creditable displays
of other orchard products, notably
olives. The art department, too, is bet
ter worth inspection than ever before.
AUTISTIC DECORATIONS.
The pavilion's interior presented a
brilliant sjght this evening. The gen
eral decorative effect is green and yel
low. The walls, pillars and balcony
fronts are hidden by palms and fir
branches, and streamers of green and
yellow bunting are strung, from the
ceiling center to eaves, while scores
of Japanese umbrellas, each carrying
a colored' electric bulb, dangle from
the roof. Never has Cloverdale seen
such a blaze of artificial illumination,
or lighting more artistically arranged.
There are incandescent lamps , every
where. They glare in profusion from
ceiling, balconies, pillars and walls,
and they twinkle amid the oranges
and lemons of .which the "set piece"
exhibits are built. The visitors' eyes
are dazzled by the brilliance until the>
become attuned, to it. " Eleetrician O.
C. Williams received congratulations,
for his splendid work. ,
Every one concedes that the stellar
exhibit is the reduced fac-simile of the
Italian-Swiss Colony's half-million
gallon wine tank at Asti. The great
receptacle is faithfully reproduced I in
miniature, and is given the position of
honor in the center of the lioor. . The
beautiful triumphal arch towering over
the tank is of green and yellow bunt
ing, and the tank itself . and the ap
proaches to .it are covered with
oranges, the interstices being, packed
with green moss. The people of the
colony have taken great pains in the
construction of their exhibit and the
result certainly is creditable to them. \
CREDITABLE EXHIBITS.
The . Cloverdale Episcopal .Church Is
also reproduced in miniature, the walls
being of oranges and moss and the in
terior brilliantly lighted. For this pret
ty display Mrs. Louise Dominie is re
sponsible. > â¢ â  â  .' I ; .
Preston is represented by a model of
the general store V at that place, also
done in oranges and -lemons, and also
prettily illuminated. Individual dis
plays of citrus fruits are made by Mrs.
Preston, Mrs. Fedora Poole and H. H.
Hubbard of Preston.
A big wheel containing a horseshoe
and surmounted by a whip represents
the citrus interests of Henry J. Crocker
of San Francisco. The device was de
signed and constructed by the young
ladles of the Cloverdale Episcopal
Church, and a beautiful exhibit they
made of it. "' :

WHAT THE FAIR 'MEANS.'
c-An \ address j by Attorney. Clarence F.
Lea of . Santa Rosa and a concert by
the Citrus Fair band, directed by D.
C. Smith"of Healdsburg, were features
of the formal opening night. After
"The Orange City March," dedicated to
the people of . Cloverdale by H. Wil
helml of Preston, had been played, Mr.
Lea was Introduced. He said,. among
other things: â 
The eleven citrus fairs held here have trfven
Cloverdale a name of which you may. well be
proud. â  Cloverdale has not slept among- the
beauties and blessings that surround us and
left thÂ«lr praises untold. She nas. by this lone
series cf fairs, proclaimed to the world that
her. people have cast their lot in a pleasant
place; that this is the home of the lemon, the
pommelo. the olive and the orange, as well
as the grape. And, though these fairs have
been designed primarily. for the benefit of this
community, you have received only a small
part ot their benefits. Sonoma County and all
Northern California are indebted to Cloverdale
on account of these - fairs. For eleven years
Cloveidale has stood sponsor fcr Northern

that the northern part of California was in the
frigid 7-one th? answer has been "Cloverdale has
her citrus fairs, her orange groves and eternal
ly blossoming flowers."
Until midnight the pavilino rang with
brazen music and the murmur of an
admiring throng moving among the ex
hibits.
COMING VISITORS.
The people of Cloverdale and imme
diate vicinity will be the chief -patrons
of the fair to-day, and to-morrow will
be Mendoclno and Lake counties' day.
when at least 2000 visitors are to be
entertained. On Monday the fair will
close with Sonoma County day, and
a conservative estimate places the
number of expected visitors at 3000. All
these folk will find as good a time as
an indefatigable committee of arrange
ments could devise for them. In addi
tion to the fair itself there will be a
big dance at one of the public halls, to
which ladies will be admitted free. .
The officers cf the Clc-verdale Citrus
Fair Association are: President. "W.
T. Brush; vice presidentsâ C. E. Hum
bers, G. W. Hoyle, G. Hagamar ana
John Cooley; secretary, George B.
Baer; general manager, T. B. Wilson.
These oflicers feel justifiably proud of
the present fair, and the people of
Cloverdale are correspondingly proud
c-f them. â¢ To their efforts Is mainly
owing the splendid advertisement
whlph Cloverdale In particular and So
noma County as a whole receives an
nually from the citrus fair. Cloverdale
has demonstrated in a way that defies
question the ability of the Sonoma Val
ley to produce oranges, lemons, pom
melcs and olives In unlimited quantity
and equal in quality to the best pro
duced elsewhere.

were conducted at the Masonic Temple
yesterday afternoon. The funeral was
In charge of the Grand Lodge of Ma
sons, of which Mr. Hayward was a
member In high standing. Edward H.
Hart of Berkeley acted as grand mas

Shortly after 2 o'clock many friends
of the deceased congregated In Kins

announced for the solemn rites to begin
there was a vast assemblage of repre
sentative men of the Western States.
The family of Mr. Hayward was not
present, its members being in the East,
and only intimate frtend3 were at the
bier. : ..
When the strains of the funeral
march announced the beginning of the
ceremonies a concourse of members of
the Grand Lodge filed into the lodge
room and those composing It took up
their respective positions. Grand Mas
ter Hart was assisted by Grand Secre
tary George Johns<5n~. Grand Treasurer
Edward Coleman and Past Grand Mas

ed the cortege formed and proceeded
to Laurel Hill Cemetery, where the
remains were deposited In a vault
pending the arrival of Mrs. Hayward
In this city. It was the capitalist's
wish that he be buried in the grounds
of his San Mateo home and as soon as
his widow can be consulted this wish
will probably be complied with.

BILL PASSES
Democratic Members of House
Object to Usiug Part of Ap
propriation in Philippines
MOVE TO AMEND MEASUEE
Spirited Discussion Follows
and the Minority Is Defeated
by a Strict Party Vote
WASHINGTON. Feb. IS. â The
House to-day passed the fortification
appropriation bill. The Philippine
question was the subject of a brief
but spirited, discussion while the bill
was under consideration.
One item in the bill provided for
fortifications in the insular posses
sions. Smith of Kentucky proposed
an amendment to preclude 'the use of
the appropriation for the use of for
tifications in the Philippines, holding
that an expenditure of the sum neces
sary properly to fortify the islands
was not warranted until the future of
the archipelago shall have been deter
mined. A party alignment on the
proposition immediately followed,
Williams of Mississippi, the minority
leader, taking up the flght for the
amendment- By a strict party vote
of Â£0 to 32. the Smith amendment was
lost. The general debate on the bill
developed into a political discussion.
Williams declared that men were not
found begging in Mississippi, nor are
men from Mississippi found around
committee* room doors in Washington
who cannot stand alone. He said
while there were many milionaires in
Connecticut, there was not one in
Mississippi. â¢
WADE GROWS ELOQUENT.
Wade of Iowa addressed the House
on the tariff question and reciprocity
with Canada. Speaking of the atti
tude of the people of his State toward
the tariff, he quoted from a communi
cation, which he said was sent to Hen
derson by Republicans of Iowa, when
he was Speaker, appealing for a revi
sion of the tariff schedules, and quot
od from the last inaugural address
of Iowa's Governor. The people of
Iowa and the Northwest have changed
i heir tariff views, he said. He had
F-een a statement that the Department
at Justice was waiting for a formal
â¢-omplaint alleging violation of injunc
tions by the beef concerns before tak
ing action. If they will go beyond the
Mississippi, he said, they will find all
the complaints they want.
Wade grre\y eloquent as he predicted
Democratic success and was loudly
applauded by the minority. He illus
trated many of his points with stories,
v.hich provoked laughter on both
tides of the House.
.Smith of Kentucky sought to limit
the appropriation so that none of the
Â£um shall be used for fortifying the
Philippines.
Littauer opposed the amendment,
saying the question of ths status of
The islands was not to be considered.
FIGHT FOR AMENDMENT.
Wiliiams of Mississippi took up the
fight in favor of the amendment, de- ',
<i;;:ing that it would be senseless to
proceed with the fortification of the
islands unless it should be determined
that the inlands wore to be held by the
I 'nited States. The dominant power,
i ho rrigning power, in the White House
and Congress had not declared this, he
t:aid.
Williams said that his opposition was
based on the fact that he did not want
Ills children taught the lesson of col
onialism and absolutism or that one
j.wple have a right to govern another
people.
Payne said it was not a question of
whether the Philippines were to be
held, but that it was the duty of this
Government while the Filipinos are un
der its care to protect them. The
? pr-aker declared that the United States
v.nuld never leave the Philippines until
-its people have established a naval sta
tion there.
By a strict party iote of SO to 32, the
amendment advocated by the minority
was lost.
Amendments proposed by Kobenson
of Indiana to prevent allotments of
money for further experiments with
the Langley airship failed.
The fortification bill without amend
ment was then passed without debate
or division.
At 6:30 p. m. the House adjourned
until to-morrow.

noon until 9:30 to-night fully 30,000
people passed the flower-covered cas
ket and took a last look upon the fea
tures of the dead statesman.
With snow blowing Into their faces
and a cold wind chilling them through,
thousands upon thousands of people
stood for hours In a double line stretch
ing for more than five squares, waiting
for an opportunity to pass into the
building where lay the remains. Al
though the crowd was passing into
the ' auditorium at the rate of more
than sixty a minute, the line grew
rapidly and when at 9:30 o'clock the
doors were closed for the night, there
were still several thousand persons who
had waited patiently, but were com
pelled to return home disappointed.
The funeral train bearing the body
of the dead Senator and the members
of his family arrived in Cleveland dur
ing a driving storm. A large crowd
had assembled about the Pennsyl
vania's 'Euclid-avenue station, not
withstanding the fact that the train
arrived more than a half hour earlier
than had been generally expected. For
a square in all directions from the cor
ner of Euclid and Wilson avenues,
where the station is located, there was
a mass of humanity. The people stood
patiently, not complaining of the cold,
and gave the police little trouble. The
station grounds were surrounded by a
triple cordon of police and none save
those entitled" to be there Was allowed
to enter either the grounds or the sta
tion.
CONDOLENCES OF ALL OHIO.
At Salem" members of Governor Her
rick's staff joined the funeral party,
of which the Governor had been a mem
ber from Washington. When the mem
bers of his staff had joined him at Sa
lem, near the State line, Governor Her
rick. in the name of the commonwealth,
extended to the bereaved family the
condolence of all Ohio.
When the train came to a stop the
first person to leave it was Governor
Herrick, who was followed by his staff.
The Chamber of Commerce committee
sotm alighted, followed by the mem
bers of the funeral party. The family
and immediate friends, who occupied
the private car, were the last to leave
the train.
The casket, completely covered with
flowers, was taken from the car
through the station and deposited in
the funeral car. Troop A, which will
act as escort to-morrow, was at the
station when the train arrived.
When-, the casket had been placed
in the funeral car . and the
members of the committee and friends
had been assigned carriages the cor
tege, headed by a platoon of police
and followed by Troop A on black
horses, moved to the Chamber of Com
merce building, where the body is io
lie jn state until Friday noon. All
along the line of march the reverence,
respect and Jove felt for the dead Sen
ator were shown. Men stood with bared
heads in an almost blinding snowstorm
while the cortege passed, and many
eyes were filled with tears. A bugle
announced the arrival of the cortege
at the entrance of the Chamber of Com
merce, and .the battalion of engineers,
which lined the entrances and exits
to the chamber, was drawn up at "at
tention." The casket was borne
through the ranks of soldiers and
placed upon the bier. In the entrance
to the hall the pallbearers, with their
burden, were followed by the mem
bers of Governor Herrick's staff, and,
taking up the rear, the citizens' com
mittee of the Chamber of Commerce
and the exchanges. The top of the
casket was removed and the face of
the dead Senator exposed to the gaze

ELABORATE FLORAL TRIBUTES.
The chamber where the body now
lies in state is appropriately set for
the occasion. From the four large
chandeliers there Is a huge canopy of
black. From a black and white rosette
in the center.four white. strtSimers ex
tend to the corners of the canopy and
around the entire hall. Near the ceil
ing is hung a wide black border. From
this, at frequent intervals, are hung
black and white streamers, reaching
to the floor. Beneath the canopy stands
the catafalque upon which rested the
remains of President McKinley at Can
ton. As lifelong friends and compan
ions, it was thought fitting that the
same bier should be used for Senator
Hanna that did service for President
McKinley. The floral tributes Were the
most elaborate since the funeral of the
late President McKinley. A whole car
load of offerings from Washington offi
cials and friends accompanied the fu
neral train. They Include a beautiful
wreath fro-m President Roosevelt. Here
already were tributes In rich profusion
from societies and friends in Senator
Hanna's own city.
A great wreath, fully five feet in
diameter, presented by the office em
ployes of the M. A. Hanna Company,
is an imposing piece, while a large let
ter, likewise constructed of flowers, ad
dressed to "M. A. Hanna," and bearing
the postmark "Washington, D. C, 6:40
p. m., February 15, 1904," occupies a
prominent place on the platform back
of the bier. This last offering was from
the postal clerks of Cleveland. A gi
gantic G. A. It. badge, built principally
of carnations, was sent by Memorial
Post, No. 141, .G. A. R.
DEATH PALLOR IS UNUSUAL.
Of the entire collection one of the
most strikingly beautiful was a broken
floral column, a tribute from the Union
National Bank of this city, of which
Senator Hanna was president. â  This
piece stands six feet high and is built
entirely of pink carnations with a base
of ferns and vines. It. is placed im
mediately at the head of the casket.
Hundreds of smaller pieces have been
received from clubs and individuals,
both in Cleveland and from abroad.
The Senator-Hanna seen by the thou
sands who filed past the bier was far
different from the Senator Hanna fa
miliar to Clevelanders in life. The face
was thin and drawn, bearing plain tes
timony to the sufferings that he had
undergone. The hands crossed upon
the chest and visible through the cas
ket front were thin to emaciation. The
death pallor was unusual.
At 9:20 o'clock to-night Memorial
Post, G. A. R., of which Senator Hanna
â¦was a member, marched to the Cham
ber of Commerce in a body and in the
presence of their dead comrade con
ducted the ritualistic funeral service
of their organization. After the serv
ice the hall was closed, members of
Troop- A remaining to guard the body
during the night.
Upon the request of many friends of
the Hanna" family Bishop Leonard will
deliver a short eulogistic address at
the conclusion of the regular funeral
services ' to-morrow upon the life of
the dead statesman. Bishop Leonard
will be assisted in the 'services by Rev.
William M. Pierce, president of Ken
yon College at Gambier; Rev. Dr. Mc-
Grcw of St. Paul's and Rev.'A. H. Jones
of St. John's Church, this city, of which
Mr. Hanna was a vestryman.
At the close of the services at the
church the body will be conveyed to
Lakeview Cemetery and after a brief
burial service in Wade mortuary chapel
will be placed temporarily in the .Wade
vault, it not having. yet been decided
where the body shall finally be interred.

NEWSPAPERS
TO FIGHT TRUST
Famine Exists in "White Paper,
Due to Monoply Held by
Manufacturers' Combination
NEW YORK, Feb. 18.â At a meeting
of the American Newspaper Publishers*'
Association held to-day the famine In
white paper was discussed and the fol
lowing resolution, introduced by Con
dee Haralin of the. St. Paul Pioneer
Press was unanimously adopted:
"That the American Newspaper Pub
lishers' Association requests the Presi
dent of the United States and the At
torney General to proceed against any
of the three paper combinations to test
the legality of their existence and
whether they do not stifle competition."
A committee was then appointed to
carry out the suggestion that an agita
tion be inaugurated to reduce the du
ties on pulp and paper.
. During the discussion, prior to the
adoption of the resolution, Don Seitz
and John Norris, business managers of
the New York World and Times, re
spectively, addressed the association,
advocating the adoption of the resolu
tion and attacked the methods of the
International Paper Company.
On behalf of the World Mr. Seitz of
fered $10,000 toward a fund to carry on
a national agitation for the removal of
the duty on wood pulp for papermak
ing, claiming that this step was neces
sary for the welfare of the newspapers
in this country.
Mr. Seitz said that the paper situa
tion in the United States is steadily
growing worse, the drouth of the last
three or four months emphasizing the
predicament of thÂ« news paper through
the operation of the International Pa
per Company. The company, he said,
controlling every factor of the paper,
making industry, had, instead" of.in
creasing its facilities and accumulating
a reserve stock for emergencies, delib
erately set out to restrict the output
of printing paper in order to secure
complete domination of the market.
During the five years of its existence,
he said, it had not put in a single new
machine, had reduced its output of
news paper at least 300 tons per day
and, had perfected arrangements with
independent mills to maintain prices.
Over-capitalized to begin with, he said,
it was impoverishing itself In purchas
ing wood lands at high prices to shut
out competition and to enrich insmers.
the whole to the ultimate burden of
the newspapers, which could not well
Increase "the price of their product or
advertising.
> "We should establish a bureau to
give this matter its unceasing atten
tion," he sa.id. ""We should assail Con
gress in the interests of free pulp and
free paper. Fully 50 per cent of the
pulp wood is now drawn from Canada
and the paper business has passed be
yond the protective period. Let us
raise a fund large enough to be effect
ive in maintaining our interests, one
which we can keep the country news
papers busy on their Congressmen."
Mr. Norris of the Times declared
that newspapers are to-day threatened
with a paper famine, many of th* p*.|
pers being on a "hand-to-mouth" ba
sis. and that the manufacturers hÂ« ;
deliberately shut down on production
"Is It not time," he asked, "that l'Â»
customers of these paper mamifur.
turers took effective steps to protect
themselves against men who show
their short sightedness, lack of enlight
enment and incapacity for the respon
sibilities they, have voluntarily as
sumed?"" ' \
At the afternoon session the com
mittee to which the subject had been
referred reported in favor of the ac
cumulation of a fund of $100,000 to
promote agitation "for release from the
oppression' of the paper combination,"
and, this report was unanimously
adopted by the association. .
The annual j meeting was concluded
to-day. These officers were elected:

"In announcing the above to your

An official proclamation explaining
the unpreparedness <rt Russia for war
and the necessity for the exercise of
patience by her people has been issued
here. It is as follows:
"Eight days have now elapsed since
ell Russia was shaken with profound
indignation against an enemy who sud
denly broke off negotiations and by a
treacherous attack endeavored to ob
tain an easy success in a war long
desired. The Russian nation, with nat
ural impatience, desires prompt venge
ance and awaits feverishly news from
the Far East.
"The unity and strength of the Rus
sian people leave no room for doubt
thai Japan will receive the chastise
ment she deserves for her treachery
and provocation to war at a time when
our beloved sovereign desired to main
tain ptace among the nations. The
conditions under which hostilities are
being carried on compel us to wait with
patience news of the success of our
troops, which cannot occur before de
cisive actions are fought by the Rus
sian army. The distance of the terri
tory and the desire of the Emperor
to "maintain pcece were the causes of
the impossibility of more complete and
pager preparations for war. Much time
Js now necessary in order to strike at
Japan, but it was worthy of the dig
nity and might of Russia, while spar-
Ing as murh as possible the shedding of
blood of her children, to inflict Just
chastisement upon the nation which
has provoked this struggle. Russia
must await the event in patience, be
fng sure that our army will avenge an
hundred fold that provocation.
"Operations on land must not be ex
pected for some time yet, and we can
not obtain early news from the theater
ff war. The useless shedding of blood
is unworthy the greatness and power
of Russia.
"Our country displays such unity and
desire for self-sacrifice on behalf of
the national cause that all true news
from the scene of hostilities will be
immediately due to the entire nation,"
BRITISH OFFICER
EX ROUTE TO STUDY
OPERATIONS OF WAR
Captain D. A. Adams of the Royal
Irish Lancers has arrived from Lon
don and is at the Palace, awniting the
departure of the next steamer for the
Orient. He is one of several British
army officers assigned to duty in Man
churia and other portions of the. Rus-
EO-Japanese war zone for the purpose
of watching the operations of the hos
tile forces.
Captain Adams served with his regi
ment for fourteen years in India, and
from there was transferred to South
Africa, where he fought through the
Boer war. Other officers of the British
army who are to go to the Orient left
England yesterday and are expected
to embark at this port for the Far East
within the next fifteen days.
Captain Adams will sail on February
26, and will proceed immediately to
Manchuria. As yet the Japanese and
Russian governments have failed to re-
Epond to the note* addressed to them
by the American and British govern
ments relative to permitting military
representatives of foreign nations to
accompany the armies, but Captain
Adams expects that before he reaches
the Orient this matter will have been
settled and his instructions will await
him on the other side.
. He declined last evening to discuss
the war, explaining that any statement
%-olunteered by him might be regarded
ee indelicate by the War Office of his
Government; but, in referring to pos
sible future entanglements of the va
rious nations, he remarked that the
feeling in the British army is that bo
matter what comes the United States
and England will be united and fight
ing for a common cause.
AMERICAN MILITARY
EXPERT MAY BE SENT
TO KOREAN TERRITORY
WASHINGTON. Feb. 18.â Having
failed so far to obtain permission from
either the Russian or Japanese gov
ernment for United States army of
ficers to accompany the forces in the
field in Manchuria, the War Depart
ment has determined to make an effort
to induce the Korean Government to
permit an observer to be stationed in
that country, which, after all, is ex
pected to be one of the principal bat
tle grounds of the present conflict.
Brigadier General Allen of the Philip
pine constabulary is paid to be likely
to be designated as military attache at
Seoul, where he would have full oppor
tunity to observe the progress of the
campaign.
ST. PETERSBURG, Feb. 18.â Owing
to existing conditions in the fields and
thp difficulties in the way of providing
suitable accommodations, Viceroy
Alexieff has recommended that the for
eign military attaches should not Join
the Russian army until about March 4.
and the Viceroy's wish in this matter
will be communicated to the govern
ments which have applied for the priv
ilege of observing the war from the
Russian side.

CZAR MAY ABANDON
SOUTHERN MANCHtRIA
TO THE JAPANESE
LONDON, Feb. 19.â Little far eastern
news appears in the press this morn
ing, with the exception of official dis
patches, and the comment is made
that the official reports of Viceroy
Alexieff and others are remarkable
mostly for what they leave unsaid.
These reports attract far less attention
than does the significantly frank Rus
sian proclamation asking the people to
be patient until the army is ready to
strike blows worthy of the dignity and
might of Russia. The threats in this
document are commented upon by the
British press in tones of considerable
irony.
It is now believed both in London and
on the continent that Viceroy Alexieff
has decided to falf back on Harbin,
practically abandoning Port Arthur,
Vladivostok and the whole of South
ern Manchuria to the Japanese, and
that he, perhaps, is hoping that the
reduction of Port Arthur and Vladivo
stok will occupy the enemy while he
Is concentrating his forces at Harbin.
According to the Tokio correspondent
of the Daily Mail, the Emperor of
Japan has declared his intention of giv
ing the treasures of the palace to the
Bank of Japan for the purpose of the
war fund. Other dispatches from Tokio
confirm the great success of the inter
national war loan.
The correspondents of the Times and
Daily Telegraph at Tokio unite in an
nouncing the resumption of the Jap
anese coasting trade, and confirm pre
vious reports. that the Russian cruiser
Boyarin was sunk during the attack
on Port Arthur on February 14. Some
correspondents say the warship in
question was the cruiser Bayan, and
not â¢the Boyarin.
A military correspondent of the
Times asks whether the Russian proc
lamation portends a repetition of Rus
sia's policy of 1812 and the Waging of
a war of exhaustion. He thinks this
proclamation can have no other mean
ing, unless it was concocted deliber
ately for deception or written with
the knowledge that the Manchurian
failroad Is wrecked already.
"Yet this seems madness," the cor
respondent .continues, "because if the
Russian army stood still while Japan
was reducing the two great fortresses
at Port Arthur and Vladivostok Russia
would become the laughing stock of
Europe and the mock of Asia."
Americans Offer Services to Russia.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 18.â So many
offers of assistance, military and medi
cal, have come to the Russian embassy
from Americans that Count Casslni,
the Russian Embassador, to-day cabled
to St. Petersburg to learn the wish of
the Russian Government in the matter.
As soon as the answer has been re
ceived an announcement as to its char
acter will be made.. In, the morning
mail at the embassy came fifty-one let
ters from doctors/ nurses, engineers
and men wishing to enter the Russian
army or navy, offering their services to
Russia in the Far East.

DECLARE THEY WERE
STARVED BY RUSSIANS
LONDON, Feb. 18.â The Japanese
legation to-day gave out an official
cable dispatch receivedfrom Tokio as
follows:
"A number of Japanese refugees from
Port Arthur, who arrived recently at
Chefu on board the British steamship
Wenchow, give in the form of a diary
an account of their treatment while
at Port Arthur as follows:
" 'February 8 â The Japanese were
forbidden to embark on the British
steamship Rasbera. All the Japanese
were prohibited from leaving the har
bor. â 
" 'February 9 â Eight Russian soldiers
were placed on guard over the Japan
ese on board the Wenchow. None of
the Japanese were allowed to land.
The Wenchow was detained and some
200 Japanese on board are about to
starve.
, " 'February 10â After appeals to Vice
roy Alexieff ten bags of rice and some
biscuits were sent to the ship in the
evening. '
" 'February 11 â No heed was given by
the Russians to our repeated signals
"No drinking water."
" 'February 13â Renewed appeals
made to the Russians to give some food
at least to the infants and sick women.
One hundred and three boarded the
Wenchow from Harbin. While on their
way they were robbed of all their bag
gage and rendered penniless. There
are now 300 Japanese on the Wenchow
and their distressed condition is beyond
description.

CAPTURE OF PORT
â  ARTHUR BY JAPAN'S
FORCES IS CERTAIN
PARIS, Feb 18.â An eminent military
authority connected with one of the
embassies said to-day that Port
Arthur was practically besieged, and
It was a serious Question whether this
would not compel either the abandon
ment or the surrender of the fortress,
with its men and material. The
grounds for this belief were stated to
be as follows:
Admiral Togo's ships, on watch at
the entrance of the port, prevent in
gress or egress, thus establishing a
virtual blockade and cutting off the
chances of relief from seaward. The
Japanese troops near Newchwang and
other points on the Liaotung penin
sula are able to interrupt the railroad
forming a line of communication and
supplies between Port Arthur and Har
bin. .The result is the gradual inves
titure of Port Arthur within the Jap
anese naval and military lines. It will
require a bold action on the part of
the Russian forces to prevent the
final accomplishment of the Investiture
and the slow reduction of Port Arthur.

Hay Plans Coalition .
Against the Russian
Continued From Page 1, Column 6.
An official of the Foreign Office ap
peared to be rather nonplused at this
conclusion to the American proposition,
but he displayed no irritation and said:
"If this is true, it has not chaneed
the Russian programme. Not to await
Russia's reply might, however, offend
Russian susceptibilities and tend still
further to increase the feeling already
existing here in certain quarters that
the United States is not friendly to
Russia.
"In this connection there is no doubt
the Government feels somewhat em
barrassed by the desire of the United
States to install Consuls in the open
ports of 'Manchuria immediately. The
Government does not like to be placed
in the position of putting obstacles in
the way, but that entire territory is
now under military control and these
posts would be within the sphere of
the- war operations. Furthermore,
trade is at a standstill at present and
the authorities cannot comprehend why
"Washington should press this matter
now. None of the other powers is seek
ing to take immediate advantage of the
privileges accorded by the Chinese
treaties.
"As far as concerns Port Dalny. to
which place an American commercial
agent has been appointed, the situation
is even worse, as it is not impossible
that the military authorities will soon
request all foreigners to leave there."
The Russian reply to the Secretary's
note is practically ready and will be
handed to Embassador McCormick in
a day or two, possibly to-morrow. It
will be along the lines already indicated
in these dispatches. In diplomatic cir
cles here Secretary Hay's action is con
sidered a fine stroke of diplomacy, as
it Is believed that the note has brought
out the general acquiescence in the
principle involved.
WASHINGTON. Feb. 18.â On Tues
day last the Associated Press quoted
a State Department official as savins:
that there would be no more notes ex
changed at present relative to the neu
tralization of China, as the powers
having accepted the general principle
of neutralization, the State Depart
ment felt that chapter to be closed.
This is evidently the information re
ferred to as causing surprise in St.
Petersburg official circles. Russia's
adherence to the principle of the Hay
note was regarded several days aco as
assured, although no formal response
from the Czar's Government had been
received.
PARIS. Feb. 18.â Following another
conference between Foreign Minister
Delcasse and Embassador Porter, it is
understood that Russia's formal ad
hesion to the American note will be
announced within a week. It now ap
pears that responsible Russian officials
made known that, with the exception
of Manchuria' from the operations of
the note, Russia had no objection to
acceptance. This was considered suf
ficient to permit France to accept with
a reservation excepting Manchuria, but
Russia's formal action awaits submis
sion for the approval of the Czar, and
owing to the pressure of the war oper
ations its submission has been deferred,
although it is expected dally.
LONDON. Feb. 18.â Great Britain's
formal assent to Secretary Hay's note
on China has not yet been given, as
varied details, notably the status of
Newchwang. require further elabora
tion. At the same time the Foreign.
Office- says the answer already given ig
tantamount to an acceptance of th?
broad principles of the note.

RUSSIA HAS THREE
HUXDKE1> THOUSAND
MEN IN THE FIELD
ST. PETERSBURG, Feb. 18.â No of
ficial announcement has as yet been
made regarding the report from Tokio
of a second Japanese torpedo attack at
Port Arthur. There are reports here,
but they lack official confirmation,
that an attack made on Port Arthur
February 16 was repulsed after heavy
firing on both sides. According to the
story this attack was intended as a
feint to cover a landing at Taiienwan
Bay but It failed because the Russian
guns were placed with great foresight
to command that shore. A Russian ex
pert says the Japanese evidently hoped
the adjacent group of Eliott Islands
would cover this movement, as they;
did the same thing during the Chino-
Japanese war, landing simultaneously
at Tallenwan and Kinchau. thus cut
ting off Port Arthur from each side or
the Llaotung peninsula.
"It surprises me." this expert contin
ues "that the Japanese should have
made such a foolhardy attempt to facÂ«
the Russians, as they must know from
their spies how strongly the peninsula
is mined and defended."
The Governments frank statement
of Russia's unpreparedness. owine to
Japan's sudden precipitation of hostili-,
ties, and the warring to the Russian
public not to expect Immediate victo
ries, confirms the opinion which has
existed here that Russia- will act upon
the defensive until her army Is fully
mobilized and the equipment of the
commissariat In working order.
There are already more than 2Q0.QW
men In the field, but this number will
be largely augmented. About 50.00!)
men are required to guard the railroad.
Almost all the private concerns here
and at Moscow and other large cities;
which Intended sending exhibits to th^
St. Louis Exposition have decided nÂ»:
to do so. and all are donating the
money they would have expended to
the Red Cross Society and other war
purposes.
The work of the Russian Red Crcmt,
Society is being pushed with great
vigor. The donations already exceed
$5,000,000. Two or three Red Cross
trains will be dispatched to the Far
East each week. One feature of Red
Cross operations which has never be
fore been Introduced during a war will
be the organization .of small detach
ments to accompany the regiments into>
action. Each detachment will consist
of two surgeons, four students and
four body carriers. First aid to the
wounded will be applied on the battle
field.
The general plan is to locate general
hospitals along the Amur at Khabar
ovsk, Blagovestchensk, etc.. and trans
port the sick and wounded back to
these points by the rivers, thus avoid
ing interference with military traffic on
the railroads.

JAPANESE STUDENT
REVIEWS THE ISSUES
WAR WILL DECIDE
ALA MED A, Feb. 13. â Kisatsuchi
Koda, a Japanese graduate of the Uni
versity of California and of Stanford
University, addressed the Unitarian
Club last night on "The Present Crisis
in the Orient.' In the course of his
lecture he said:
The bloody contest now being waged In thÂ«

expansion. The result of the fierce tight now
on is fraught with the greatest Importance to
the nations of the world. Japan has been ex
pecting and preparing for this trouble tor tho
last decade.
There Is no doubt that Russia's iceonraphlcal
situation is responsible for her political policy
of territorial expansion. She wants an outlet
to the Pacific Ocean superior to that at present
through Siberia, where the ports are so often
closed to commerce by the cold. Russia, in
pursuance of this plan, has been steadily work-

is how she has obtained a hold In Korea. This

SHOULD BE ASSESSED, AND APPLIES RULE IN BANK CASE
Decision One of Most Important Ever
Rendered Regarding Revenues
The permission of the State for any
corporation to conduct business is e
taxable franchise, according to a de
cision rendered by the Supreme Court
yesterday. Every incorporated con
cern in California from a fake oil
company to the Southern Pacific Rail
road is affected. It is impossible to
form any adequate idea of the amount
of increased revenue which will in this
manner accrue to the State, county
and municipal governments during the
course of the next year.
The value of these â¢'corporate fran
chises" is to be fixed by deducting the
value of tangible property from the
market value of the stock in each
company. When it is realized that
many concerns have little other tan
gible property than office furniture
and paper, though the market value
of their stock is considerable, it may
be seen that when the subtraction in
dicated by the court has been per
formed, there will be left something
on which the Assessor may get to
work.
The Bank of California, which In
stituted suit against the City and
County of San Francisco, will have to
pay exactly f 12,187 76 more annually
under the new order of things. There
ere more than fifty other banks in
this city alone and all of these will be
affected, to say nothing of the other
corporations with nhich the State is
crowded.
Four Justices rendered the decision,
two dissented, and one did not par
ticipate. The attorneys for the bank
will petition for a rehearing. Asses
sor Dodge and Assistant District At
torney Brobeck say that this decision
is the most important to the taxpay
ers of any that have been rendered
for twenty years.
STOCK CANXOT BE TAXED.
Under the laws of California the
Ftock of corporations cannot be taxed.
Hitherto this has meant a release
from taxation of an immense amount
of taxable property. Under the Su
preme Court decision the tax on fran
chises will counterbalance the loss ex
perienced through freedom of stock
from taxation. Thus one of the great
sources of corporate wealth will no
longer escape paying taxes.

WASHINGTON, Feb. 18. â From
Minister Bowen's reports it apears
that conditions in Venezuela are

He cables that by a decree just .is

ports of Guanta, Sucre and Guiria,
which have been closed for many

also reports that the Venezuelan Gov

This installment amounts to $77,000
and is overdue between two and three
years. Of the various arbitration
commissions, which have been in ses
sion at Caracas for the past six
months, nearly all have completed
their labors and it will be possible for
the Venezuelan Government to begin
the settlement of the claims allowed
promptly on the announcement of the
result of the Hague arbitration, which
will determine the order in which the
claims are to be paid, whether on a
pro rata division between all the pow
ers concerned or with a preference to
the blockading powers.
CHICAGO ELEVATOR COMPANY

CHICAGO, Feb. 18.â The Chicago

amounting to $2,D00,O00, was placed in
the hands of a receiver this afternoon
on petition of a judgment creditor.
More than $1,255,000 in first mortgage
bonds of the elevator company are said
to be outstanding.
Eight elevators in Chicago and three
valuable sites for elevators are sched
jjk-d as having been named in the trust
deed given to secure the bonds when
they were issued on March 1, 1894.
Two of the elevators have been de

Suffers Attack of Heart Failure.
Frederick J. Richards was found
in an insensible-condition on Ihe'cor
ner of Franklin i.mi Eddy streets last
night and taken to the Emergency
Hospital, where he now lies In a pre
cHrious condition. He is apparently
suffering: from heart disease. He re
tidts at 1905 Filimore street.
The case was brought as a test, and
the leading spirits in all of the State's
big corporations have watched for the
decision with the utmost interest. .As
sessor Dodge has maintained that all
incorporated concerns posses3 a fran
chise. He has made assessments
which the Board of Supervisors, sit
ting as a board of equalization, has re
jected. It was finally determined to
let the matter be settled by the courts.
Dodge found the aggregate value of
the tangible property of the Bank of
California to be 55.156,903 08. The
market value of the shares of stock at
the time of assessment was $8,100,000.
The difference between these two
amounts â $2,943,096 92 â was held to
be the value of the franchise. Dodge
then assessed the franchise at $750,
000. The Board of Supervisors al
lowed the assessment to stand. This
occurred during the year 1901. The
bank brought suit in the Superior
Court to have the assessment declared
void. The taxes were paid under pro
test.
CORPORATION FIGHTS HARD.
The banlt was prepared to put up a
hard fight. The attorneys delved deep
into the law books and raised an army
of authorities. The arguments that
they brought before the Supreme Court
were so numerous that the Justices in
their long opinion handed down yes
terday could answer only a few of
them. The City Attorney's office was
also kept busy on the case, and its
full list of citations from the author
ities was imposing. The Superior Court
rendered a decision in favor of the city,
and the whole matter was then trans
ferred to the State's highest tribunal.
The bank's attorneys claimed that
their client had been incorporated in
1S64 and had never been possessed of
any kind of a franchise. The Supreme
Court agrees that the right to do a
banking business is not a franchise.
Such right, however, can only be ex
ercised by permission of the State. This
grant by the sovereign power is vir
tually a franchise and affects all con
cerns which take advantage of the
benefits to be derived from incorpora
tion.
The bank's lawyers argued that if
such a franchise exists in the case of
corporations, it is not of the taxable
variety. The court says that it is
somewhat in the nature of a special

reliable sources that a bill will be re

House Committee on Territories joining
Oklahoma and Indian Territory into a

This State will not be admitted, how
ever, until after the allotment of lands
by the Dawes Commission has been en

question has been settled. This, it is
estimated, will take at least two years.
The State when admitted, it is ex

800,000 persons and will be divided into
four Congressional Districts.
Later a bill will be reported admitting
Arizona and New Mexico as a single
State, but this latter proposition will
not be pressed for some time.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 19, X904.
ASSESSOR DODGE STATES HIS GASE
SAN FRANCISCO, February i8, 1904.
This decision Is one of the most important relating to taxation rendered in California in the last twenty
years. I have awaited this decision anxiously since the first assessment of the franchise of a corporation
other than a quasi-public corporation was made by me four years ago. In this decision the Supreme Court
takes up one by one the various arguments and objections that have been advanced during the last four
years opposing the assessment of the franchises. The court decides that in view of the constitution and
laws of thiS State such objections are without merit.
As these assessments of franchises were made by me four, years ago on my own initiative after care
fully studying the revenue laws of this State, and as I have been at times violently criticized on account of
such action, I cannot help having a strong feeling of gratification that my view of the law has been upheld
by the court. . . ' '?. . '
This decision will enable the Assessors of the State to add millions of . dollars of taxable property to
the assessment rolls. The assessment of the franchise involved in this case, that of the Bank of California,
was three-quarters of a million dollars. On last year's roll in this city four' million dollars of such fran
chises were assessed. The validity of these assessments is now established. These assessments- will alone
bring in taxes of six hundred thousand dollars. This amount will undoubtedly be very much increased this
year, now that the court has upheld the legality of such assessment. - . 0 -
I am most gratified, however, at the statement in the decision to the effect that the "court could not
say that the amount at which the franchise was assessed was either unjust. or excessive." The court recog
nizes the justice as well as the legal authority in taking the full cash value of the shares of stock of a cor
poration into consideration as somewhat of a guide in arriving at the value of a franchise.
This decision places great. power in the hands of an Assessor. Were such power unreasonably used it
might result in injury to the community. Excessive taxation of personal property is unwise. Many modern
authorities are opposed to any taxation of personal property, believing it to be a tax on business and en
terprise which will retard the growth of the community. With this question, however, as an officer of the

Papers Published in the Japanese Empire.
Japanese newspapers which have
just reached this city publish an ac
count of the arrest, in Yokohama of
Takahashi Monsaku, an interpreter to
the Russian naval attache. It is al
leged that this man has been in receipt
of very high rewards for collecting
and supplying information about Jap
anese fortresses and military and na
val affairs in general. One Tokio
journal puts his property at a million
yen, and says that he would have ef
fected his retreat to Russia long ago
had he not been asked by his employ
ers to. remain a little longer. The po
lice are said to have been on Taka
hashi's tracks for a considerable time,
and his treacherous doings were
known In Yokosuka. But the difficulty
was to lay hands on proofs, and that
has only just been accomplished.
Speaking of the exodus of Japanese
from the islands in the straits of Ko

"The people of Tsushima are said to
be making arrangements for the trans

Moji, Hakata and Shimonosekl in the
event of an outbreak of hostilities.
Tsushima, if it possesses great natural
beauties, has the misfortune to be sit

one of the. probable fields. Its position
inflicted great suffering on its inhab

"The Japanese residents of Fusan

KOREA AS A BATTLEGROUND.
If Russia and Japan come to -blows
over their present differences, writes
R. J. Macmasters in the Manila Cable
news, they are likely to find in Korea
a field of battl-e in which the desper
ate deeds of valor of the ancient Greeks
will be repeated, for Korea, is a land
of rocks, mountains, ravines and riv
ers. Its roads are always suggesting
to the traveler Macaulay's words. "In
yon straight path a thousand may well
be stopped by three." The Spartan
band business could be done here in
a thousand places even better than it
was done in the "glorious days of old."

From Toldo comes the report that the advance guard of the Russian army has taken up a strong
position at Pingyang in its march * toward Seoul, but it Js added that an . immediate advance upon the

RUSSIA'S STUPENDOUS TASK.
A warning is said to have been fur
nished of the dangers Russia would
have to apprehend in connection with
her single line of railway did war break
out. At twelve places in the line be
tween Dalny and Tashikiao bombs are
said to have been placed. Fortunately
they were discovered before any cas
ualties ensued. The outrage Is attrib
uted to Chinese coolies who have fallen
into great distress owing to a sudden
lowering of wages by the Russian au
thorities. Great numbers of these cool
ies were employed transporting goods
between Newchwang and Part Arthur.
But many of them have been thrown
out of employment and the others find
it difficult to support life on the pit
tance they are earning. If the greater
part of the inhabitants of Manchuria
were bent upon doing an injury to the
railway it would become a very pre
carious asset.
Over and above the duties of actual
combat Russia has an immensely diffi
cult task to perform in guarding the
integrity of that single thread upon
which her military potentiality in Man
churia depends, the long line of rail
way. No asset is more valuable in
war, no asset more, vulnerable. She
knows well what risks that line of rail
way involves, and she will try to keep
even the strictly neutral Chinese as
far away from dangerous temptation
as possible. Perhaps it is to that one
desire that* we should attribute move
ments described in the telegrams of the
Nichi Nichi Shimbun: namely, the
crossing of the Liao by a force of 200
Russians, the occupation of a place
on the western side of the river, and
the .deflection of a . considerable force
toward the Shanhalkwan-KInchow
line. If she has to guard the west
ern, southern and " eastern frontiers of
an immense region, and at the same
time to sustain herself and protect a
single line of. communication through
a country where the, population is hos
tile, her task demands . an immense
army. . ' 'â

Assessor Dodge pursued the right
course in attempting to discover the
value of : a corporate franchise. The
method of procedure is laid down plain
ly. First find the value of the tan

amount subtract the first and the re

"As will be seen from another col
umn, the latest cables from England
state that the universal opinion there
is: that, if Japan, goes' to war, she will
be defending the world's cause and pro
tecting the interests -of progress and
civilization. This is quite in harmony
with the article In the Times, on which
we, recently, commented, which stated
that. Japan was upholding the ideals of
the Anglo-Saxon race. Now we should
be the last . to deprecate the publica
tion of friendly sentiments of this kind.
They â¢ encourage the Japanese Gov
ernment to persevere in the adoption of
a firm and self-respecting attitude, and
they are undoubtedly true as far as
they go. But it is well. In a grave na
tional crisis' like the present, to hold
fast to actual facts, and to put aside
merely sentimental considerations. We
thoroughly believe in the righteousness
of. Japan's cause against Russia, and
we also consider that, in making her
present stand against the aggressions
of the latter country, she is indirectly
serving the Interests of the rest of the
civilized world. But it would be an
entire misconception to suppose that, if
Japan takes the field against her for
midable antagonist, she will do so, pri
marily, in order to fight 'the world's
cause' or to uphold Anglo-Saxon
ideals."
BRITISH STEAMSHIP
REPORTS HAVING BEEN
UNDER RUSSIAN FIRE
SHANGHAI, Feb. IS.â The British
steamship Hsiping, which arrived here
to-day from Chlnwangtao, reports
that she was fired upon by the Rus
sian ships and forts when seeking shel
ter in the outer roadstead of Port Ar
thur, and that she was then ordered
to Dalny, where she was detained four
days in spite of the captain's protest.
The Russian gunboat Mandjur has
not gone up the river to be dismantled,
as reported. She remains at Shanghai
In defiance^ of the orders of the Chinese
officials to' leave this port.
Previous advices from Port Arthur
have explained that the firing on the
Hsiping was due to a mistake, for
which ths Russian officials expressed
regret. The vessel was detained at
Dalny, according to the Russian ex
planation, for the reason that she had
many Japanese aboard, who would
have been able. to supply their Govern
ment with information concerning the
Russian and forts if they were
permitted to go direct from Port Ar
thur.

of railway employes in the United
Kingdom get more than $14 60 a

Expresses Opinion That Three-Quarter
Million Valuation in Cause
at Bar Is Just.
Is grievously mistaken as to the amount
which plaintiff should be assessed. The
court says that when -the Assessor
makes an assessment which is approved
by the Board of Supervisors, sitting
as aboard of equalization, the matter
is not subject to judicial review. If
the Assessor makes a fraudulent as
sessment or one that is manifestly un
just, the Board of Supervisors has the
power to correct the wrong. After ex
plaining that It could not interfere in
any event, the court furnishes the in
formation that it considers the assess
ment in question to be liberal to the
corporation. The objections by the
bank's attorneys to the legal points of
the City Attorney's office are given
some consideration in the opinion, al
though they are not answered In de
tail.
SAYS . BUSINESS IS COMMOX.
The corporation lays particular stress
on the legal fact that banking is a
â¢'common" business; that is, one which
any ono may conduct without let or
hindrance. It is asserted that to tax
a franchise of this particular charac
ter Is in violation of the fourteenth
amendment to the constitution of the
United States.
The court declares that the tax im
posed in the case at bar is not upon
the business, but upon the property of
the corporation. The right to do a
banking business is common within the
meaning of the law, but the exercise
of that right has given the privilege
a taxable value. It "is stated that an
attempt will be made to carry the mat
ter to the'United States Supreme Court
on the ground that this alleged viola
tion of the fourteenth amendment is
a Federal matter.
The Supreme Court concluded Its de
cision with the remark that persons
or partnerships in the same business
would not be subject to this tax, which
is applicable only to those having a
corporate franchise.
The opinion is written by Justice An
geliotti, with whom Justices Shaw, Van
Dyke and Lorigan directly concur. Jus
tice McFarland writes a dissenting
opinion. He claims that this "fran
chise" as defined by Assessor Dodge is
not sufficiently definite. The partic
ular property, he hojds, should be iden
tified. He maintains, secondly, that
such a franchise is not assessable be
cause the State constitution does not

MEANS MrCH TO CALIFORNIA.
Assistant City Attorney Brobeck Dis
cusses Supreme Court Decision.
When the City Attorney's office was
apprised by The Call yesterday after
noon of the decision of the Supreme
Court in the suit brought by the Bank
of California against the city W. I.
Brobeck made the following state
ment: ,/^".
The decision of the Supremo Court ta th!Â«
case is of greater importance to the in
tegrity of the tax system of California, relat
ing to thÂ« assessment of corporations, than
any other casa that has. been decided in recent
years. Aside from the franchise taxes Imme
diately Involved in this and kindred cases now
pending, of which it was a test case, a con
trary decision would havÂ« meant the releass
from taxation of one of the greatest xourcea
of corporate wealth. Under our system no
direct tax ts levied upon the shares of stock
of California corporations, the taxation of ths
stock of such corporations being accomplished
through the taxation of the property of the
corporation.
Inasmuch as the tangible property of a â cor
poration is generally much less than the aggre
gate market value of its stock, it would nec
essarily result, if no franchise taxes were pos
sible, that the stock of the corporation could
be indirectly taxed only in that proportion
which the tangible property of the corporation
bore to the aggregate market value of Us
stock. This would result In the exemption
from taxation, in the cases of most corpora
tions, of a very considerable stock value.
Not only would that be true of the stock of
California corporations, but by rtason of thÂ«
partial exemption of such stock from taxation
it would be Impossible to assess the stock of
national bank*, the assessment of which, under
the act of 1899. has been sustained by the Cir
cuit Court of Appeals for this circuit, and
will undoubtedly be sustained by the United
States Supreme Court. It is my opinion that
no decision lr. recent years has approached in
importance the decision In this case in Its
tearing upon the taxation of corporate propsr
tles. The State is to be congratulated upon the.
issue.

Plan of Morales Govern
ment to Force Annexation
WASHINGTON, Feb. 18.â No news

departments over night regarding the
reported landing in Santo Domingo of

The United States, it i3 emphatically
stated, does not want Santo Do

chase, and the officials do not pro
pose to permit the Morales government
to force annexation upon this country
by continuing a scheme of attacks upon
our interests. It will not surprise the
officials to know that the reported at
tacks of the "revolutionists" have been
inspired by the Government.

killed to-day in his office in Brooklyn
by Frank McNamara, foreman of the
joint room of the Illinois Watch Case
Company's factory at Elgin, 111.
McNamara refuses to say why he
shot Jennings. He came here a week

wife and eight children live.. Jennings
served as captain in the Fourteenth
Brooklyn Regiment In the Spanish war.
He leaves a wife and three children.
McNamara was formerly employed
in a watch factory at Sag Harbor, L.

cause of the murder. Jennings is said
to have exclaimed, "Frank, you're
wrong," a moment before the fatal
shot was fired.

.An exhibit of more than usual inter
est will be made to-morrow afternoon
at the Oakland High School of the work
of the school children of Oakland,
which will be forwarded to the St.

Oakland school children were awarded
the first prize for their exhibit at the
World's Fair at Chicago in 1893. partic

The exhibit, which may be inspected
by the public between the hours of
2:30 and 4:30 o'clock in the afternoon,
is comprised of the work daily accom
plished by the pupils. In it are speci
mens of drawing, solutions of geomet

products of the school routine. The
pupils engaging In this work are aged
from 8 to 18 years. Those who have
been permitted to see the exhibits ex

thoroughness and the beauty of the
pupils' efforts.
In speaking of the proposed exhibi

"The work of the children this year
Is far superior to that which won the
prize at the World's Fair. I have been
connected with educational work for
many years, but the specimens of the

STUFFS JUNIOR
BALLOT BOX
Illeg-al Vote Nullifies the
Election! for Class President
and Causes Complications
WILL CALL A BE-ELECTION
Walter Stalder Admits He
Cast the Illegal Paper, but
Says :It Was Only a Joke
Berkeley Office San Francisco Call,
2148 Center Street, Feb. 18.
A senior stuffed the junior ballot box,
and now the Junior class of the Uni
versity, of; California . does j not know
whether it has a class president or
not. Miss Flora Frickstad got c-ne more
vote than 'Miss 'Nellie McCarthy, at the
polls, but it- was that senior's vote
that. gave Miss Frickstad" the majority,
so that really the "candidates for the
office were tied. The only thing that
will straighten out the tangle is a re
election, and that the election commit
tee decided upon such procedure this
afternoon.
Nobody would ever have been the
wiser had not the offending senior con
fessed to the stuffing of the ballot box.
He is Walter Stalder of the class of
'04, who says he voted for Miss Frick
stad. He says he did it for a joke.
He gave the name of Smith to the elec
tion officers and was surprised when
they accepted his vote. One of the pe
culiar complications comes from the
statement of one of the election offi
cers that he destroyed the vote Stalder
cast, while yet another says the ballot
went into the box along with the oth
ers. It is not absolutely certain now
whether Stalder's illegal vote did get
into the box.
Now that the election is discovered
to have been clouded neither of the
co-ed contestants wants the place.
Miss Frickstad said to-day that she
did ncrt want the office if it took a
fraudulent vote to elect her. and Miss
McCarthy wants Miss Frickntad to
keep the place, declaring that she will
not be a candidate again.

GARNETT IS '' PROTESTING
AGAINST SO MUCH DELAY
Motion to Dismiss Information Charg-

by Judge Iiawlorl y- -'-
The argument on the motion to dis
miss the information against Alexan
der B. Garnett, charged with the mur
der of Major J. W. McClung, waB heard
by Judge Lawlor yesterday and the
motion was denied. The defendant was
allowed till to-day to plead, when his
attorney. W. D. Grady, said he would
file a demurrer.
Grady made two technical points In
his argument yesterday. One was that
the' defendant, who was arrested in
Alameda County, should have been
taken before a committing magistrate
there in accordance with the statute.
The other was that ,the commitment
should have been upon the complaint
or deposition and not .on a separate
sheet of. paper.
Garnett is protesting at the delay.
Before the case was called yesterday
he remarked that he was getting tired
of being constantly dragged In a shack
eled condition from the County Jail to
the court and felt particularly sore at
having been shackled yesterday to a
colored man .who was tried for rob
bery.

LIE IS PASSED
IN THE COURT
In an Argument to a Jury
Attorney A. L. Frick Assails
Chief of Police Hodgkins
ACCUSES HIM OF PERJURY
Denounces Head of the Depart
ment, Whom He Says Spirited
Away an Important Witness
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1113 Broadway, Feb. 19.
A sensation was sprung during the
arguments of the Nathan case to-day
before Judge S. P. Halt when Attorney
A. L. Frick. a former Superior Judge
of Alameda County, in his address to
the Jury attacked Chief of Police
Hodgkins and stated that he had per
jured himself in giving his testimony
on the stand. "Fairly Interpreted, the
testimony shows," he said, 'that Chief
of Police Hodgkins sent Mrs,. Nathan
out of Oakland so that she could not
be a witness in this case; that he prom
ised her Immunity, from arrest if she
would give testimony against her hus
band and that he committed perjury
in his denials."
The case is one that has been bit
terly fought by Frick in an effort to
free his client, who has been com
pelled to go to a second trial and prob
ably a third. After being out several
hours, the jury disagreed to-day and
was discharged, seven being for con
viction and five for acquittal. The evi
dence given by the police and the dis
appearance of the principal witness has
made the case an extremely difficult
one to conduct for the defense.

CAX HAVE DYSPEPSIA
And Still Be Asxccable. Attractive and
Popular â A Certain Cure in
Reach or All.
There is nothing: that will put you to
'he _ front bo rapidly in the business or
.sovial world us a. cheerful disposition
and a pleasant appearance. Other
things being equal, people will go out
or ineir way to give the fellow a lift
w ho always wears a cheerful counten-
ance. The man or woman with a
cranky disposition and a sour face will
â â¢'"ays meet with an indifferent if not
â  chilly reception. The commercial
traveler, who is the recognized busi-
ness barometer, appreciates better
than any one the value of this rule
iind governs his actions accordingly.
Dyspepsia destroys all the agreeable
qualities that enter into a man's or
woman's make-up. It is almost a hu-
man impossibility for any one with a
severe case of dyspepsia to look pleas-
ant. The continuous, miserable, cast-
down feeling is bound to make itself
shown in the appearance and conver-
sation.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are the
sufferer's certain cure. They ate so
recognized all over the world. The
<ures they have brought about and
the happiness they have caused and
the suffering they have relieved has
made their name a household word in
all the English-speaking world.'
The reason that Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets are a certain cure is that they
are a natural cure. There is nothing
10 prevent them curing. They con-
tain the essential ingredients of the di-
gestive fluids of the stomach and
dimply do the identical work of the
stomach, relieving that weakened
organ and permitting it to rest and
recuperate. Could anything be more
simple or natural? They are bound
10 cure. They cannot help themselves.
It Is just like putting a new stomach
into a man â if that were possible â
and letting the old one go off on a
vacation. Rest is what it needs. Na-
ture will do her own work of restora-
tion, never fear.
Stuarts Dyspepsia Tablets are for
*a!e by all druggists at 50 cents a box.
All druggists means all druggists.
They have become so necessary to the
people that the druggist simply has to
keep them anyway. There are other
remedies that he can make much more
monpy on if ho could sell them, but
hp can't. He will not take chances on
losing his customers by not always
having on hiind a supply of Stuart's
Dyspepsia Tablets.

JURORS HEAR
DE LABROUSSE
Slayer of Miss 3Iarie Jordan
Goos 011 tlfc Stand and Gives
Testimony in His Own Behalf
TELLS OF SUICIDAL INTENT
Explains Preparation to Take
His Own Life, but Denies He
Desired to ifurder Sweetheart-
Yesterday Edmond de Labrousse, the
slayer of Miss Marie Jordan, testified
in his own behalf in Superior Judge
Dunne's court. He was in no way dis
concerted and with the exception of
giving his evidence in a voice scarcely
audible during the first part of the ex
amination his answers to the questions
of his counsel, Attorney Roche, were
rational and consistent with, the evi
dence already given by numerous wit
nesses.
De Labrousse was sworn and in reply
to Attorney Roche he detailed the cir
cumstance of his meeting Miss Marie
Jordan when he was engaged in the
glove department of the City of Paris.
He told of his request that she bÂ«j
transferred from the ribbon department
to the glove section, giving as his rea
son that he desired that she should be
near him and that there was more
money In it for her. as she would re
ceive both a salary and a commission.
He related how their friendship grew
into an attachment for each other and
continued his evidence by saying:
"Marie and I had an understanding
that we should come together and we
spoke of the future. At that time I
was living with my mother and sistera
in Oakland. I left my mother's resi
dence on May 30. 189S, after numerous
quarrels. I told Marie that all was off
with the family. My mother told me to
decide between herself and Marie, and
I decided for Marie.
PRISONER WEEPS.
"Mane and I got so far that we
agreed to settle down. The affection
that existed between us was very
stroner."
The prisoner wept slightly at this
point and after a short interval became
composed and continued:
After May 30. 1S0S. I never went home
apain: 1 never called unon my mother or
younger sister. I took a stow on Stockton
i ,; Â». hl!< Clt - Vl llUt bus =in e ss van very had.
I told Marie It was all right. Miss Uly Jor
dan accused me of belne a liar and caused
Marie to e i\Â» me up . Mlss LJ[y Jor .
dan would rick at me and we quarreled
Mane took my part and would cry sometimes
l^cauFe Lily was ao hard. Then Marie con
cluded that we had better not go out together
a*= it caused trouble at home and 1 cave In
saying:. "Anything for peace."
An estrangement did occur. I remember the
nitfht of .September 28. 1903. I was living at
Mullaly s on Polk street. Mr. Feret. a friend
in the same house, opened his trunk for come
cigarettes or a cigar and I saw his pistol ly
ing there. I Jeft the room and tried to read
I flevi no more that night than on other
nights. I decided next mornlnjr that. I was
KdTiE to kill myself.
PREPARES FOR SUICIDE.
After writing fome letters I wanted to kill
myself in my room, but wished to see Marie
once more.
I accordingly went out with that Intention
and saw her leave the car at California and
Hyde streets at her usual time for coming
home to lunch between 11 and 12 o'clock. I
told her not to be hard on me and she felt
sorry for me. I asked her to have city on
me I walked with her and went ahead to her
mother s houee, as I wanted to see her mother.
De Labrousse at this stage of the
examination again gave way to tears.
Asked what followed, the prisoner
said he remembered nothing more un
til he regained consciousness in the
Emergency Hospital, when he found
his mother and sisters by his side.
The three letters written by De La
bfrmsse, the contents of which have
been already published, were read to
the Jury.
De Labrousse admitted that Mrs.
Jordan, who had been as kind to him
as a mother, had told him that he
had not sufficient means to marry and
advised him not to enter into matri
mony until such time as he was in a
position to take the responsibility. Mrs.
Jordan told him he might wait. Marie
was supporting her mother and an or
phan blind child, Mrs. Jordan's grand
child.
District Attorney Byington asked
him whether upon opening the gate
leading to Mrs. Jordan's house he did
not shoot, but the prisoner made no
answer.
MANY WITNESSES TESTIFY.
He was asked whether after shooting
Miss Jordan he did not shoot himself,
to which question he replied, "So they
said." He said thafrhe wrote the three
letters within an hour or two before
he left his room to meet Miss Jordan.
To Attorney Roche's question as to
whether at any time the defendant
had made up nis mind to kill Marie
Jordan, the prisoner replied, "No: why
should I?"
Among the witnesses was Mrs.. Mary
Murphy, the prisoner's sister, who
spoke of her brothers* coming to con
sciousness in the hospital, and who
upon learning of the death of Miss Jor
dan, screamed, "Oh, my God, forgive
me!"
Henry Stern spoke of De Labrousse's
nervousness and Dr. Edwin Bunnell
gave testimony to his attending De La
brousse at the hospital and stated that
the bullet was extracted from the
wounded man's head. Dr. Bunnell gave
it as his opinion that De Labrousse
was insane at the time he regained
consciousness and during his stay in
the hospital and gave his reasons for
the. conclusion.
Other witnesses examined for the de
fense and who believed De Labrousse
to have been mentally deranged before
the murder were Josph F. Bluxome,
Edward Feret and Dr. E. J. Creeley,

SECRETARY
NEWLY ELECTED SECRE
TARY OF THE STATE
BOARD OF TRADE.
California's State Board of
Trade Mikes Move to
Expand.
L. M. Fletcher, who has been promi
nent in local railroad circles for some
time, has been, appointed secretary of
the California State Board of Trade.
He began, his duties yesterday. His
appointment does not mean that any
vacancy has occurred in the old force
of the board, but it is one of several
indications of a widening of the board's
work. Arthur H. Briggs remains as
manager, and George Dennison contin
ues with the board as assistant secre
tary. There is a large amount of work
that has been planned for the immedi
ate future.
Important bulletins relating to the
resources and advantages of Califor
nia are to be prepared to supplement
a series that has already issued from
the press and been widely ' distributed
in the East. A strong effort will be
made to increase the membership of
the organization. The aim is to have
every section in the State interested.
The work of the board Is for the up
building of the State in all ways.
In the growth of the work it has
been found indispensable to add.to the
force. Mr. Fletcher, the new appointee,
has a thorough knowledge of the State
by reason of long railway connections
and he is popular with the business
men of San Francisco with whom he
haÂ» had relations. A definite line of
campaigning has been mapped out for
Mr. Fletcher. It will bring him in con
tact with the public.

Health Board Pronounces For
mer Almshouse Administra
tion a Disgrace to the City
COMMITTEE FILES REPORT
Asserts the Municipality Lost
Money in the Ordering and
Furnishing: of Its Supplies
The special committee of the Health
Board, consisting of Drs. Poheim,
Hughes and Harvey, appointed, to in
vestigate the affairs the Almshouse,
filed its report yesterday, which; wad
adopted by the. board, 'in "which it
charges that the former administration
of the " institution has . been a disgrace
and resulted in a larg^, sum of money
being lost to the city owing to startling
irregularities in the ordering and fur
nishing of supplies. The report follows
in full:
SAN FRANCISCO. Feb. -< 17, 1904.
To the Honorable Board of Health â â  --
Your committee appointed to look into the
affairs of the Almshouse desires to report in
addition to its last findings, submitted on Feb
luary 4, 1904. the last meeting of .the Board
of Health,' the following facts on administra
tion of the Alsmhouse: v : !*-,
First â We find that with hardly any excep
tion the contractors have not heretofore fur
nished the supplies according to the quality
called for in their bids. For example, when
the first order for pork was sent In by the new
superintendent a barrel one-half the regular
size was sent out and upon the refusal of the
superintendent to accept it as a full barrel it
was taken back and a regular size barrel was
sent out. This last month of . January one
barrel of pork was used and, the committee on
inquiry found that there was no diminution In
the serving of pork In January from that in
December. Nevertheless, the records and
requisitions show that In the month of Decem
ber four barrels of pork were used. It seems
plausible to the committee that half-barrels
Instead of whole barrels were served the pre
vious administration, and the came was tried
on the new superintendent, the difference be
tween four barrels per â¢ month under the old
administration and one barrel per month of
the new administration being easily explained
thereby. - *
MEAT .NOT UP TO STANDARD.
The meat contractor sent out cow meat in
stead of steer meat as called for in the con
tract, and upon the superintendent refusing to
accept the same the contractor's representative
came cut and before witnesses said that he
had an understanding with Dr. d'Ancona that
the meat of the Almshouse did not need to
come up to the standard of the meat furnished
the City and County j Hospital. The new su
perintendent has nevertheless refused to ac
cept any t>ut steer meat. It can easily be
seen that the city was paying for steer meat,
but was EettlnK cow meat without any objec
ion from the administration of the Almshouse.
The amount of money thereby saved to the
contractor can hardly be estimated or traced.
, On June 13, 1908, six milch cows were
bought at $â¢")*. Only a glance at the animals
( wlll tell any one that the city paid dearly for
them. In June, also, a baggy horse was
bought and $200 paid for the same. No horse
man would evÂ»r pay more than 5100 for the
animal and then consider it well paid for.
The contract for furnishing syrup calls for a
superior grade.. There is still some syrup from
the old administration on hand, but It is not
what the contract provides, but of a cheap
quality.
There is a bill on file for a rubber mat, but
the superintendent has been unable to find the
same, it having mysteriously disappeared under
the old administration.
The contract for furnishing btankets calls
for five pound woolen blankets with the name
of the Almshouse upon them. The contract
ors have right along without apparent pro
test from the old administration furnished
four-pound blankets without the name of the
AlmBhouse upon them, but have been collect
ing the full contract price for five-pound blan
kets without any objection.
TRACKS WELL COY T ERED.
It is perfectly, impossible for ..this commute*
to begin to enumerate all the. Irregularities,
many of which can be surmised but not proven.
thÂ« tracks having been well- covered. The
committee finds that the administration of the
Almshouse has been a disgrace to the city.
Everybody did as he pleased and nobody was
responsible to the head. The amount of money
lost to the city In the ordering of supplies and
where this money went will never be discov
ered and can only be surmised. . *
The committee has only begun to discover
the Irregularities a.nd It does not doubt but
that from time to time more discoveries will
be made and be reported to the honorable
bbard.

the guilty parties might be brought to
justice.

A Singer's Preparation.
Jjy VERNOX DfARXAIXB.
D!ytinc"JÂ»>"ii*~ HarytrÂ«se and InFTru<-tr>r in
ttucte "t tJjo I'nlvcrfcity . ol Chicago.
(C'oj-yriihU 1!>C4. by JoÂ«rh B. Bowles.)
Beiv,ein the vocalist and the singer
a rrreat gulf is fixed, for the vocalist
may have j>erfected the mechanical ap
paratus oJg.-oice to the highest decree,
may have **ie perfection of breath con
trol, comnJ^e command of all his vocal
resources and an exquisite quality of
tone, and yet this is only the means to
an end; just as a magnificently built
piano which is capable of responding to
Â«*very artistic demand awaits the Pa
derews-ki who is able to use its re
sources for artistic expression. There
fore the singer, in the highest sense,
is he who. possessed of all vocal re
quirements, has beyond that a wealth
â¢ if jvetle insight and recreative power
whicn is expressed through his voice.
After all, a beautiful voice may be the
gift of nature, and as such deserves no
more extra credit than any other beau
tiful physical feature.
The art of eongr is the union of poetry
and music. Therefore, he who would
prasp it in all its fullness must be as
appreciative of the literature which he
sings as of the music. Every singer
should make a study of his language,
and of other languages as well, for each
language reacts upon the other and en
ables him to have a broader scope. He
sboulK study carefully the skeleton
work of the language and know its pos
sibilities for artistic expression. The
proper use of consonants, the quality
of vowel sounds and the power to join
them together, and a distinct enuncia
tion should be his constant care. Most
<'f all, In the study of a language for
ringing purposes, one finds the great
neglect of consonants. Especially in
Knglish is this true, and it is seldom
that English-speaking singers enunci
ate clearly or bring out the nobility of
the language.
With the old-time singers the chief
idea was vocal perfection. During the
period in the development of music
over a hundred years ago, composers
wrote largely to please singers; the
words to their songs were a secondary
consideration and served the singer
merely as a peg upon which to hang
a melody. With the advent of Schu
bert and his immortal songs arose the
necessity for singers who could sing
them. Vogl, fine singer for his time,
and close companion of Schubert,' once
made the statement that a new school
of voice production was needed in order
to train singers to interpret well these
j^ongs. This was largely because Schu
bert expected the singer to interpret
the words of the poem as well as the
music. The idea of the importance of
the words in singing reached Its cul
mination in Richard Wagner. .Here the
word Is the all-important factor, and
music a secondary consideration. Wag
ner's influence has been felt in every
department of musical life, and espe
cially so in the art of singing. It is
certainly true that vocally speaking
Wagner does not give the singer the
opportunity to bring into play all his
vocal resources, but demands strength,
virility and declamatory powers. On
the other hand, while the vocal side of
ringing may not reach its highest pin
nacle with Wagner, he opened up new
fields of interpretative methods which
have been felt ever since. To-day the
singer { must have lived himself into
the words which he sings, and then be
sides have at his command the perfec
tion of vocal equipment. It will at once
be seen how much higher is the plane
of the modern singer than that of the
singers of the olden time.
Of all languages perhaps English is
the moFt abused by singers. It is by
no means easy to vocalize beautifully
and at the same time sing English in
telligibly. This difficulty, added to the
fact that a majority of great songs are
Id foreign languages, may be some rea
son for the neglect of English among
singers. But for one to sneer at our
language as one unfitted for singing is
the variest snobbery. It is to be re
gretted that the literature of English
soaes Js not chosen from among the
works of our best poets. In fact. It la
decidedly inferior. Surely our grand
old language, which served the genius
of a Shakespeare, needs no defense as
to its capabilities of expressing the
moods and thÂ« phases of the human
heart. And then, from a purely tech
nical standpoint. It surely has the pos
sibilities for producing pure vowel
rounds and a pure legato style of sing
ing. As a matter of fact English has
a wealth of vowel sounds, and, while
this presents new difficulties, it also
presents the possibility, for larger de
velopment.
â¢ â¢ â¢
'In the study of songs the singer
should first of all study the words and
luok into the possibilities ot expression.
A study which presents a never-ceasins
source of joy is to take sentence by
rcntence the words of a song and con
trast the vowel sounds with one an
mher. as one might think of a kaleido
scopic succession of colors. Then there
t- hnuld be the careful effort on the part
of the interpreter to bring into prom
inent thoee words which have especial
si?TjiCcancp or are characteristic in any
manner of the poem: Let him devote
himself also to bringing out the accent
.-incJ emphasis. In other words, a truly
zood interpreter of songs should be a
jjood reader of verse*.
Modern :nusic, especially, with Its
complicated harmonics, makes great
demands :ipon the broad musical^ educa
tion 0' the elnger. Mere knowledge of
voice will not suffice for the interpreta
tion of the best modern aongs, for the
voice has become more and more recog
nized as a musical instrument and &s
such is so intertwined with the ac
companiments that it is impossible for
the singer to ao justice to his part of
the song -without a knowledge of the in
strumental score. Besides this a knowl
edge of composition and the laws of
musical form will give the singer the
power to build up consistently and log
ically his climaxes. Ana it is along
this very line that many singers with
well-trained voices are deficient.
There is no better influence for a
singer .than to hear performances of
classical dramas, where the language
may be heard in its beauty and purity;
where the characters must be inter
preted and where he may obtain cor
rect ideas of phrasing in speech. Aside
from this, the emotional development
which comes from listening to plays is
of lasting value to the singer. Take
the combination of a really artistic vio
linist, who knows how to phrase well
and whose tone is rich, as n, model
for vocal beauty, and tn*e great art of
an actress like Mmc. Earnhardt, who
has perfect command of her language,
and from these two the singer may
derive an inspiration for artistic in
terpretation which few teachers are
capable of siving.
An example of the potency of the lan
guage when reinforced by music is to
be found in Richard Strauss' setting of
Tennyson's poem, "Enocn Arden." and
in many of the same composer's songs
the subtle use of the declamatory style
where the language is all-important, in
contrast with lyric phrases, where the
voice is given a show, is a study that
should interest all singers.
The singer of to-day, aside from be
ing equipped with voice, musicianship
and a knowledge of the languages,
must have at his cormand a wealth
of mental and emotional sympathies.
He must be able to portray all phases
of emotional life, from the most som
ber and tragic all through the gamut
to the light, the fantastic and the hu
morous. He must be able clearly to
produce the mood of the composer and
poet. In this respect the singer of
songs has a niche all by himself. He
must be able, without the use pf stage
effects, scenery or other illusion, to
carry his audience with him through
all climes, seasons, moods and phases
of artistic expression.
The time has gone by forever when
a singer by shouting a. high C or sing
ing a sentimental ballad can lay claim
to being an artist. The interpreter of
to-day who can stand before a large
audience and reveal to them one by
one the exquisite beauties of the
"Dichterliebe" cycle of Schumann does
not represent merely a vocalist, but
an artist with a noble mission of re
vealing the inner ideals of the human
heart, and thus elevating his hearers.
How much nobler the aim of such an
artist than to be merely idolized for
the gifts which nature has bestowed
upon him! The very fact that the aim
of the singer should be the recreating
and vitalizing of the wonderful works
of song literature Is. the best reason
for' the perfection of all his vocal re
sources. In the act of interpretation
he should be unhampered by. restric
tions of a bad method, improper
breath control or ignorance of the laws
of vocal production.
Of course it is not possible to lay
down laws and rules for all voices
and varieties of faults, but there are
certain fundamental principles of
voice production that hold good at all
times. Among these the breath and
its control are undoubtedly the most
important. The throat, the relaxation
of. all the muscles around it, including
the jaw and the tongue, and the con
ducting of tone to the proper reson
ance cavities, are matters which are
universally .necessary, and recognized.
In thus separating these two portions
of the voice for analytical purposes,
we must realize that in the actual pro
duction of a tone they cannot be taken
apart. Each one depends on the other
and the study of the vocalist is to get
the perfected adjustment of each to
the other. This is a life study and a
never ending source of interest, work
and gratification.
St. Louis Notes.
One of the largest and most valuable
collections of Indian relics in the United
States, the property of General John T.
Wilder of Knoxville, will be exhibited
at the St. Louis Exposition by the State
of Tennessee.
An elephant made entirely from al

Yankee Enterprise.
The American commercial invasion of
England is fertile of stories of Yankee
shrewdness. An especially good one re
counts that an enterprising Yankee
came over to England %nd decided to
open a shop in Birmingham. He ob
tained premises next door to a man
who also kept a shop of the same de
scription, but was not very pushing in
his business methods. The methods of
the Yankee, however, caused the older
trader to wake up, and with the spirit
of originality strong upon him, he af
fixed a notice over his shop with the
words, "Established fifty years," paint
ed in large letters. Next day the
Yankee replied to this with *a notice
over vhi? y store to this effect: "Estab
lished yesterday; no old stock.'".'

MR. CLEVELAND'S CALL.
MR. CLEVELAND has issued a call to the Democ
racy, which is a reiteration of his former state
ments of his position. It *is-partly on the lines
of Mr. Olncy's speech at the New York dinner, and
aside from propo'sing to reopen the closed chapter of ex
pansion presents little that is new. Its only adroit fea
ture is the subjunctive statement about the Panama mat
ter, which leaves open the way to indorse what^has" been
done, provided that we have no part in the changes of
sovereignty on the isthmus.
The statement has features in Common with the opin
ions of the leaders of the Whig party," after it was mori
bund and its membership had scattered to the Free Soil
ers and the Knownothings. As late as i860 it was
supposed to be possible to call Whiggery out of its
grave by the candidacy of Bell and Everett, but this
proved impossible, though no one lacked in respect for
the personal motives of those gentlemen, and none ques
tioned their patriotism. But there was other patriotism
and there were other patriots, and the ' times had so
changed "that the Whig party had become a part of the
political paleontology of the country, and its remains
were among the fossils of history. Mammoth fossils, they
may have been, but they were evidence of former and
not existing. life.
The Democratic party is measurably in the same con
dition. No' one pretends that the Republican party is
without flaw. But in its strength and its flaws it is now
representative of the average genius and aspirations of
the country. The people realize the need of having
things done, and the Republican party is the existing in
strument of action.
Nations- never set up and. approve a reactionary poli
cy. If they did, we might expect the United States to
return to reliance on the Virginia and Kentucky resolu
tions of 1798 and 1799, and to clamor for the restoration
of slavery and the interpretation of the constitution as a
rope of sand. Parties are not obsoleted for action, but
for the lack of it. The Democratic party had its oppor
tunity in the early weeks of 1861, when action would
have averted the Civil War. But it failed to act, and let
time pass in which the Confederacy equipped itself for
war and the Union slept, not upon its arms, for it had
none. For that lack of action it was condemned and did
not regain public confidence until its fortunes were rep
resented by the dominating personality of Mr. Cleve
land. But then the promised action on the tariff, which
secured his second election, failed so miserably that he
was compelled to denounce the failure as "a record of
perfidy and dishonor."
Again the opportunity for action was offered to it
when the pinch of hard times left its deep mark on the
flesh of business, and the public credit was about to be
sucked into the vortex. In that crisis the party not only
failed, but it deserted him and left him to tread the wine
press alone and attacked and repudiated him. The Re
publican party, emerging from defeat, acted, and the re
sults are all around us in the superior prosperity of the
country since 1807. Mr: Cleveland does not seem to
understand that it is not him but his party that is dis
trusted, that has been repeatedly weighed and found
wanting. As it failed twice to respond to and follow his
leadership, neither he nor all the priests and prophets
can guarantee that another trial would find in it a proper
instrument of the country's progress and protection.
The only effect of Mr. Cleveland's latest appeal will be
to act as a corkscrew to open the vials of Mr. Bryan's
wrath, and that o'f the Democratic members of Congress
who esteem it a pleasure to repudiate Mr. Cleveland,
his advice and all of his works and ways. The country
is a different country from that of 1892, and the Democ
racy is a different Democracy from that which was led
by Jackson and Polk. It embodies all of the reaction
ary elements and its spirit is destructive and not con
structive. Parties are not controlled by the sentiment
of their minority, but by that of their majority, and the
majority and all of the active and organized forces of the
party are against Mr. Cleveland and will - make no
rapprochement, even though he go far, as he does, to
invite it. â¢
The Republican party is induced to sobriety of mind
by the appearance he presents, for to parties in this
country he has become a legend that reads, "Remember
Death." The party in power has in its ears the voice of
conscience, summoning to cartNand patience in its policy
and courses, and is urged forward by the demands of the
country that our position in the world shall not be re
ceded from, nor our domestic progress "Slackened by
doubtful experiments. When the Republican party is
ousted from power, it will not be because of prompt ac
tion in national emergencies, but for lack of it.
. As far as human wisdom can discern causes now oper
ative, the strength of President Roosevelt lies in his
promptness and wisdom of action, and while that is the
case the voice of the reactionary will be unheeded, no
matter what measure of personal confidence is given to
the individual who utters xtr.
A suit for maintenance instituted by the wife of. a
jockey has revealed the interesting fact that the diminu
tive and recalcitrant husband has an income of $1500 a
month. Who would be a college president when under
the American notion of values a strong arm. a pigmy
body and a convenient morality can earn such a monthly
wage? , I
PAN-BRITISH FEDERATION.
ALL is not serene in Greater Britain. The out
break of a war, in the East, which may suddenly
take a turn no man dares to prophesy, has come
as the last blow to the nerves of overwrought English
statesmen from Thames side to Tasmania. For down
in the newly pacified colony of Transvaal there are stir
rings and mutterings which seem to have set a-tingle
national consciences of almost every dependency of Ed
ward's crown.
The importation of Chinese coolie labor to work the
mines of the Rand has stirred up such a storm that talk
of an imperial federation to oppose it on the part of the
colonies is in the air. In fact, Mr. Seddon, Premier of
New Zealand, has invited all of the self-governing de
pendencies to join with him in creating a general boy
cott upon coolie labor anywhere in the domains of the
British crown. Despite the fact that Sir Wilfrid Lau
rier, Premier of Canada, has given Seddon's invitation a
somewhat brusque refusal, the ' underlying, sentiment
which is embodied in the New, Zealand Premier's propa
ganda is a significant one and calculated to win the sup
port-of colonies more nearly interested.
The state of affairs against which Premier Seddon
would have all of Greater Britain protest is this: Upon
the reconstruction following the close of the Boer war
the necessities ; of reviving agriculture and placing the
country once more upon a self-supporting basis drew la
borers to the fields, leaving the mines of the little ring
of capitalists short of labor. It seems that Lord Milner
offered very weak resistance to the importation of the
coolies to carry on the work of the Rand mines, so that
at present white labor is almost excluded. Premier
Seddon's plan for an imperial federation to resist this is
nothing more nor less than an assumption that what is
to the interest of one colony is for the welfare of all.
Further than that it has been construed to be an ex
pression of interdependence on the part of British de
pendencies in matters concerning , the, good of any one
of them. ;â¢'; :â ; â :%
This is a new and to the conservative home people a
somewhat startling doctrine. It implies that "home rule,"
somewhat grudgingly bestowed upon the most impor
tant dependencies, has come to mean federation against
the rule of the mother country in crown provinces. This"
pan-British spirit would evidently draw together the self
ruling dependencies into a bund which should have a
care for the crown colonies very much as we of the
United States tend to the interests of our Territories.
That this spirit is growing among the colonies there is
no doubt; that* it is not yet strong enough to be gener
ally accepted is attested by Laurier's curt refusal.
The home papers cover their alarm at the progress of
this pan-British feeling by belittling the import of Pre
mier Seddon's efforts. The London Globe, after making
a cursory review of the situation, remarks that "the rest
of Great Britain is not affected in the slightest degree,
except sentimentally. The needs of each British colony
and dependency being individually special and particu
lar, it would be monstrous to measure all with the same
rule. It is left for the Transvaal to decide whether it can
struggle out of its growing financial difficulties without
resorting to the only method (Chinese labor) by which
an adequate supply of labor can be secured for the full
and "rapid development of its â > intrinsic resources:"
That hideous monstrosity of modern crime â the train
wrecker â has made his appearance again, this time on
the road to Santa Cruz. Only the most exacting vigi
lance prevented a harvest of death, and the fiends
have disappeared into the unknown. The capture
and punishment of these enemies of society should be
made matters of vital concern to everybody. A personal
interest should inspire capture, and punishment should
urge the machinery of the law to immediate purpose.
OUR GUNS IN SANTO DOMINGO.
WHAT they call national politics in Santo Do
mingo is merely an exaggeration of ward poli
tics in the tenderloin of New York. That unquiet
country plunges from one revolution into another, each
without any higher purpose than getting power to use
it for robbery. In the present disturbance a service man
in our navy has been murdered, and the property of
Americans looted by both sides. It is a repetition of
the Greytown affair in' the fifties. On that occasion a
Democratic administration sent a man-of-war to Grey
town, and bombarded the place until it howled for
mercy. A Republican administration has now given the
unquiet and predatory Santo Domingans a smell of
American powder, and it is probable that a larger dose
would benefit them.
It is sad but true ihat nothing else will infuse many
of those Latin-American nations with respect for inter
national law and rights. They despoil our nationals
recklessly, and, even when their spoliations are arbi
trated, refuse to abide by the decision when it is against
them.. The proper thing for this Government to do is
to e.nforce arbitral results with a man-of-war, and when
this has been* done once there will be less occasion for
arbitration, because there will be less spoliation of our
people and <?f the nationals of other countries. The
administration is working for the peace, prosperity and
progress in good government of the hemisphere when
it burns powder down there under proper and prolonged
provocation.
It is evident that a little saltpeter will be adminis
tered to cure the disease of international bad faith on
the Pacific side of the Americas. We speak of those
countries as "our sister republics,',' when they are
neither. That they may become both is the wish of
their best people, who are unfortunately in the minority,
and require our assistance to bring the others around to
their way of thinking.
Santo Domingo has kept the West Indies in a turmoil
for years. Her revolutions for predatory purposes have
made her coasts and waters unsafe for commerce and
have restrained her domestic prosperity.* This Govern
ment does not want that country and would not like it,
but we do want public order, there and an observance of
international obligations, and if the only way to get
them is under our guns the Santo Domingans are to
blame.
The situation in this hemisphere under the Monroe
doctrine causes Europe to regard us, and properly, as
the policeman of the nations which, we will not permit
the rest of the world to discipline or punish. If we are
to be the policeman we must evidently carry a club on
our beat, and use it effectively if the occasion demand.
It has just thwacked Santo Domingo, and other heads
may be sure to get it if several of those countries do
not mend their manners.
While the Japanese have proved themselves doughty
fighters and worthy of any foemen's steel, have they not
forgotten in their boasting the instinctive modesty that
is much of the charm and not a little of the strength of
deeds well done? In their prediction that the war will
end in July let them remember, the foolish boast of the
British general who. said he would take his Christmas
dinner in Pretoria. He narrowly escaped doing so as a
prisoner of war.
A prominent Japanese resident in this country, and
needlessly voluble, predicts that- we must soon be a'fight
ing factor in the Far Eastern war. Whatever sentiment
of sympathy we may entertain for Japan in the present
crisis in her affairs does not blind us to the demands of
our refreshing policy to mind our own business and to
insist upon others minding theirs. Washington has not
yet commissioned Tokio to dictate its course for peace
or war. V
An effort has been made to attach some significance to
the fact that the next leading prize-fight in this city will
be fought on the eve of All Fools' day. Let those that
seek to analyze passing events cease to concern them
selves. There' is absolutely nothing unusual* in the af
fair. Every day is All Fools', day for the people of; San
Francisco as .far as their patronage of 'plug-uglies is a
sign of their interest" '
TALK OF THE TOWN
AND TOPICS OF THE
TIMES
Fire and Satan.
During the lifetime of the late
Chief Dave Scannell of the Fire De
partment he was known to become so
excited during the extinguishing of a
fire that he used to indulge in a liberal
supply of profanity. This being one
of the traits of his character, no doubt
acquired from his earlier New York
training, his men paid no attention
to the language used, but went right
along as if his words were those of
praise and endearment.
On one occasion the Chief was ap
proached by a certain, minister, who
remonstrated with him in well chosen
words.
"Chief,- while we all admire your
executive ability and pluck in the per
formance of your arduous duties, yet
we regret exceedingly that your use of
profanity is such as to shock the bet
ter element of society."
"A-hem," responded the Chief,
looking at the meddlesome preacher
with scorn. "You see, my men are
used to me and they know that I do
not mean one word of what I say to
them when I swear. Just like the
members of your congregation when
you rant and pose; they know you are
insincere and do not mean one word
of- what you say. Now you go along
and fight the devil in your way
and leave me to battle with fire In
mine and maybe both of us will find
it warm work when we get through,
as both the devil and the fire give us
two a good living."
The Capable Wharfinger.
He had just received an appoint
ment as State wharfinger. He looked
almost nautical in the blue and gold
of a new uniform, but the tan which
darkened face and neck had been ac
quired in an inland valley and owed
none of its rich depth of tone to the
salt laden ocean breezes which give
the Colorado maduro tinge to the sall
orman's hide. It was his first day on
the water front. Salt water he was
acquainted with in the form of brine.
Ships he had never seen. A friend
of the friend of a Harbor Commision
er was a friend of his and a manip
ulation pf this chain of friendship
had landed the job and placed this ex
pert plow pilot in charge of one of
San Francisco's busiest wharves, and
responsible for the safe berthing of
a never ending succession of valuable
floating properties. A steam collier
lay alongside the wharf. A Jacob's
ladder hung invitingly over the rail.
"May I come up on the roof," the
new wharfinger asked of a deck hand.
As he climbed he commented on the
precarious "stairway" and arrived on
deck to burst into admiring criticism
of the huge "stove pipe" which was
vomiting clouds of black coal smoke.
He walked to an open hatch and
gazing into the depths remarked with
the air of a Columbus: "Wall, I swan,
the gol-derned thing's hollow."
Hayward' s Answer,
The death of Alvinza Hay ward
makes timely the telling of an in^
dent which occurred when the beauti
ful Hayward building on Montgomery
and California streets was being con
structed. The owner stood admiring
the splendid pile gradually nearing
completion, when he was suddenly
touched on the elbow by an impecu
nious relative.
"I see you are admiring your new
bailding, Mr. Hayward?"
"Yes," was the cuiet answer.
. "It is very beautiful," said the rel
ative, "but it's a pity you cannot live
long to enjoy it."
The mining Â»man paused a moment
before replying and then said dryly:
"No. but I shall be compensated
somewhat by leaving it to a person
who can!"
It is safe to say, the tactless man's
name will not appear in the will as
legatee of the building.

The Naval Scribe.
Over at the^ naval training school the
young sailors publish a monthly, Naval
Flashes, which sometimes .., contains
some very creditable little things. The
following bit of good advice shows the
right spirit:
"One often hears the expression from
men and boys who have been at the
station -a short time that they wilh
their cruise was over." Many of them
seem to dread it and imagine all sorts
of things are going to happen to. them.
It is hard to say where they get the
idea* from that a cruise in a training
ship' is six months of hard times 'and
misery, but no doubt the cause of it
is the stories told them by boys who.
have been on a cruise and failed to
pass their examination at the end of it.
When a training ship returns there are
always a few boys who, through neg
lect and inattention to- their drills and
studies, fail to pass the required ex
amination and are sent back to this
station to make another cruise. No
doubt these boys tell of the terrible
hardships that they endured and give
it as an excuse for having failed to pass
their examination. There is nothing
to dread in making a training cruise
and especially a cruise along the south
ern coast ot California; on the con
trary, there is a great many things to
look forward to with pleasure. There
are new places to see and boys are
given more liberty and money provided
they remain first class. There are
hunting and fishing parties and ball
games and sports of all kinds. And
best of all there is a change of scene,
and one is always going some place
or going to see something that he prob
ably never saw before. Don't believe
the man or boy who tells you It is hard.
He is not telling you the truth, and
if you could Investigate his career you
would probably find out that when he
was on a cruise he was a shirk or
took nc interest in his work or duties,
and consequently when the time came
for his examination he failed to pass.
He probably tells you these stories to
lead you to believe that he (if you are
foolish enough to do so) is a hard fel
low or that so and so was down on him.
You will enjoy your training cruise
if yon do your duty and act right and
the months will pass ere you know they
have gone, and you will be surprised
when the time comes for you to return
to your home on furlough. Don't be
lieve the tales they tell. See for your
self."

BEB LEAVE OF ABSENCE
Board of Education Cites Mrs. [redale
to Answer a Charge of Mis
representation.
The Board of Kducation met yester
day and adopted a resolution providing
"That Mrs. Charles V/inslow Iredale
(nee Booth) be summoned to appear be
fore the board on Thursday, February
25. at 1:30 p. m., to show cause why
she should not be dismissed from tht?
department for obtaining a leave of
absence under misrepresentation."
The former Miss Booth's alleged of
fense consists in having stated in her
application that her leave of absence
was necessitated by her illness, when
in reality she asked for the leave for
the purpose of getting married, which
is considered unpardonable in the eyes
of the board. Unless Mrs. Iredale can
satisfactorily explain the matter she
will be dismissed from her position,
resolutions to that effect having al
ready been prepared.
The resignations: of Miss Margaret A.
Burnett and iliss M. L. Day as reg
ular teachers in this department were
accepted.

was granted.

ground that they had conspired to
gether to defeat the interests of th?
stockholders. Because of this suit, it

ANOTHER SUIT
BY PARK1S0N
Guardian of Aged Sarah Wood
ward Trying- to Set Aside Her
i Agreement With the Trustees
MINISTER IS DEFENDANT
Document in Question Gives
to Strangers Absolute Con
trol of Old Woman's Wealth
Once more is aged Sarah Woodward,
a wealthy woman of Santa Clara, in
the courts. It was only a few months
ago that she was the subject of a bitter
legal dispute in the Probate Court, in
which on one side were arrayed her
sons and daughters and sons-in-law
and daughters-in-law and on the other
J. R. Lewis. J. Leiter and Rev. Eli Mc-
Clish, prominent residents of San Jose,
who, since 1901, have managed the old
woman's property. H. J. Parkison,
son-in-law of Mrs. Woodward, was the
prime mover in that action. He suc
ceeded in wresting the control of the
person of Mrs. Woodward from the
Garden City people, and now he w^.nts
to take from them their interests in
her property. Yesterday he filed a suit
against Lewis, Leiter and McClish to
set aside a conveyance to them of Mrs.
Woodward's estate, made by her in
1901. which conveyance stripped her of
everything but a life interest in her
own property and stipulated that upon
her death it should go to the Univer
sity of the Pacific. The action is based
on the charge that at the time the
conveyance was made Mrs. Woodward
was more than 80 years of age and
was therefore not mentally capable of
understanding the import of the docu
ment.
The property In question consists of
an annuity of $600, payable to Mrs.
Woodward from Henry French; $533
cash in bank and a ranch near Sara
toga. Under the conveyance it waa
the duty of the defendants to collect
the annuity, use the cash as they saw
fit for the benefit of Mrs. Woodward
and collect the rents, issues and prof
its of the Saratoga ranch. Upon her
death what was left of the property
was to be conveyed by the trustees to
the University of the Pacific, a relig
ious institution.

TIKES OF LIFE

White Wife of Yonetaro Fku
inoto, a Merchant, Gets Di
vorce on Ground of Cruelty
SAYS HE -MISTREATED HER
-Judge's Decree Ends Romance
Be^un AVheii Plaintiff Was
Clerking" for the Defendant
The romance of 'pretty Mary Abra
hams, who at Kobe, Japan, five years
ago became the wife of Yonetaro Fku
moto, a Japanese Merchant; for whom
she had worked when he conducted
a store in this city, ended yesterday
in the divorce court. Judge Kerrigan
gia.ve her an interlocutory decree on the
ground of extreme cruelty, awarded
her the custody of her two children
and made- an order directing Fkumoto
to pay her $11 a month toward their
support. Fkumoto was present during
the hearing of the suit, but made no
defense, even when his pretty wife gave
evidence that branded him as a wife
beater, a drunkard and a cruel father.
Mrs. Fkumoto's story Is a sad one.
She- first met her husband when he
kept a store in this city. She clerked
for him, and when he left this city to
return to his native country to estab
lish himself in business there she fol
lowed him. They were married in Kobe
In October, 1898, and for a time a*ll
went well. She taught school while
he ran a little store. Altogether their
married life for several months was
aa happy as it could be. Then one day,
because she was ill, Mrs. Fkumoto re
fused to see a Japanese woman who
called. Her refusal angered Fkumoto
and he struck her. She left him and
took refuge with the wife of the Ameri
can Consul. Finally she returned to
him and a little more than a year ago
came with him to this country, where
he again took up the business of sell
ing Japanese ware. For a time he
treated her well, and then, after he
became addicted to the use of liquor,
commenced abusing her and their two
little boys. Then she left him and
went to live with her father, a Jackson
street merchant. She filed the suit for
divorce last January, a few days after
Fkumoto came to her father's house,
where he abused her and the children.
Gertrude Mills was granted a divorce,
on the ground of neglect, from Charles
B. Mills by Judge Hebbard. The cor
roborative evidence in the case was
furnished by Professor W. M. Searby
of the University of California. The
ctmrt made an order giving Mrs. Mills
the custody of her child and $40 a
month alimony.
Divorce decrees were also granted to
Hjalmar Brunell against Florence A.
Brunell for intemperance, Eva Kin
ka'de from Samuel R. Kinkade for neg
lect and Teresa E. Peterson from
Adolph Peterson for cruelty.
Suits for divorce were filed by Grace
Page against William Page for neglect.
Cora Hoertkorn against Charles Hoert
korn for cruelty. Rose Sheir against
Harry Shier for desertion, Hattie E.
King against James E. King for con
viction of felony and Alexander Wil
liams against Gertrude Williams for
cruelty. Williams says his wife wor
ries him greatly by telling him that
she does not care for him and that
she Is love with another man. He also
charges that she is not above kissing,
caressing and hugging the "other man"
when opportunity offers. .
Sues Choynski and Newman.
â¢Attorney Herbert Choynski and

Secretary of State Board of
Health Points Out an Alarm
ing Fact About Pneumonia
IS PREVALENT IN EAST
Expresses Belief That Disease
Is Communicable and Deems
Precautions Are Necessary
An interesting question relative to
the public health is raised by the
State Board of Health In the monthly
returns of the mortality in California
during the month of January, 1904. This
is whether an increase in the deaths
from pneumonia . is not due to the
bringing in of germs from the East
by the army of strangers who have
come to California to escape the rigors
of an eastern climate. The report is
signed by Dr. N. K. Foster, secretary
of the board. He takes the view that
there is significance in the larger per
centage of deaths and in the coinci
dent centering of the greater part of
the eastern visitors in California cities.
"Pneumonia," so reports the State
Board of Health, "has increased 25 per
cent. This would not be alarming were
it not for the large death rate from this
disease in the where it has be
come almost epidemic. The increase
has been largely in cities filled with
visitors. If,* as is now quite generally
believed, pneumonia is a communicable
disease, it\emphasizes the necessity of
enforcing expectoration ordinances. It
is encouraging to see that this has been
done in some places, but in. most it
is entirely ignored. One has to walk
but a block in any of our towns and
cities to see numerous pools of con
tagion in the form of expectorated con
tents of some one's diseased organs.
This is a menace to everybody. No
dcubt many cases of pneumonia, scar
let fever, diphtheria, tuberculosis, etc.,
have arisen from germs carried home
on skirts or shoes."
With the report. is a lot of statistical
matter relating to mortality in the
towns and cities, from which'it is. made
to appear that the death rate, as indi
cated by returns in January from
thirty-six localities, was 1.33 per 1000
outside of public institutions and 6.25
per 1000 in public institutions.
There are more wrecks in the Baltic
Sea than in any other place in the
world., The average is one wreck a
day throughout the year.

Basil Williams, the English poloist,
vas the first to send a thrill through
the spectators. While galloping across
the field his pony stumbled, with him
and tossed him off, Williams turning a
Â«Â«'.rnplete somersault. In the pony's
struggles to retain his feet he struck
Williams on the right hand* and fore
arm. The hand was forced into the
ground and was severely bruised.
Walter McCreery and Captain Chap
lin were the next sufferers. There waÂ«
a scrimmage around their trpporients"
goal and the ball was finally driven,
outside. Three riders galloped off the
field in their rush after the bali-and
ran into some deep sand. Tb<? ponies
stumbled and Mr. McCreery's roiled
over on him, stunning him momentar

HORSEMEN WANT
ANOTHER TRICK
Representatives Meet and Dis
cuss Plans for Construc
tion of a New/ Racecourse
The various horsemen in the city are
still hard at work in an effort to secure
a mile or a half-mile track in Golden
Gate Park. A special meeting of the
Golden Gate Park Driving Association,
Carriage Owners' Association, Paciiic
Coast Trotting. Horse Breeders' Asso
ciation, San Francisco Driving Club
and the Pacific Amateur Association,
was held at the Palace Hotel last night
for the purpose of discussing plans and
ways and means. . .
Just where the new track will be
located is at the present time uncer
tain. The members of the -various as
sociations of horsemen are desirous of
securing a site near the Casino, but
Superintendent McLaren of- Golden
Gate Park is not in favor of this loca
tion. >;
.- McLaren explained to the horsemen
that the expense of equipping a track
there would be great and he favors
seme other location. McLaren is said io
be in favor of eliminating the regular
speed track if. the new track is about
to, be constructed.. To this suggestion
the horsemen are bitterly opposed,, as
they want to retain the old speed track
at all costs.
. There were several lively discussions
at. the meeting last night and many
plans were submitted to the' executive
committee. Finally a committee was
appointed â  to - wait upon McLaren at
the : park lodge on â¢ next Wednesday
afternoon - and -lay, the plans of thÂ«
horsemen before him. .
The members of the Park Commission
will also be approached | regarding thu
new track and it is thought that the
board will act favorably toward the
horsemen. The Pacific Amateur Asso
ciation will utilize 1 the inside part of
the track as an athletic: oval should it
be .constructed , and ; therefore . the. mem
bers of that organization are leaving
nothing undone to secure the track.
' The polo players . of. this . city and
Burlingame are also anxious to secure
a portion of the inside of the track.
But the Pacific Athletic Association
will not agree- to this, as, the polo men
will want too much space and also, will
be liable to cut un the ground to such
an, extent as to render it useless to
the athletes.. . . ,
The'cost'of constructing the proposed
track has - not- as yet * been figured on
and various sums have been mentioned.
It is thought, however, that the track
couldbe built. and equipped for about
$15,000. . ' .

GORG ALETTE, A 15 TO 1 SHOT,
DOWNS A VERY SHIFTY FIELD
Players of, Favorites
Again Meet With
Reverses. \
Five favorites were torpedoed and
sunk with more disastrous results to
the talent at Ingleside yesterday than
was suffered by the Russians in the
harbor of Poi-t Arthur. The two-year
old Eduardo alone survived the bom
bardment, winning at odds of 9 to 10.
Among .the rank and file distinguish
ing themselves were Sir Preston, Bou
tonniere. Gorgalette, Hipponax and
LSyronerdale.
El Primero stable's record holding
mare Divina gave the crowd a stag
gering blow by sulking at the post in
'the mile purse run, and being left. She
was heavily played at 11 to 5 and it was
through no fault of Tommy Burns that
she failed to get away. This event
went to Gorgalette, a 15 to 1 shot, rid
den by "Big Bill" Knapp, which passed
Esherin below the eighth pole, and won
ridden out from Grafter, a 10 to 1
chance. Leader,' the second choice,
finished third. The winner was backed
sparingly on the strength of a fast
workout.
Bard Burns has gone back or else Sir
Preston is a vastly improved horse.
Probably the latter. The Bard with
Willie See up was played down from
8 to 5 to evens in the betting on the
five and a half furlong sprint, first de
cided. See rode. a careful, well judged
race, but Sir Preston possessed the
most speed, and Trayers landed him
first at the v.-Ire a head before the fa
vorite. C. Smith on Maud -Muller,' a
150 to 1 .shot, was third.
Eduardo, from the Burns &. Water
house stable, WOB' so much the best of
the starters in the two-year-olds spin
that he couldn't help winning. AVell
played at short odds, Bell brought the
son of Eildie Jonos home first an easy
winner over Mogregor and Cardinal
Sarto. Saccharate received very weak
handling.
Boutonniere, a 6. to 1 shot, beat the
well-played favorite Decoy in the seven
furlong selling: affair. Jack Martin
rode the iirst choice and went*- out in
front with 'the faint-hearted gelding.
In the stretch he was hard pressed by
Sheehan astride Boutonniere and
cracked, the latter finishing first by
half it length. Dandle Belle, ridden by
Bell, finished third at odds of 15 to 1.
Ancient old Amasa, at odds of 30 to 1,
was only downed a nose by Hipponax
for the six furlong run fifth to be de
cided. C. Smith had the' mount on
Amasa and breaking in , front of his
field made all the running. He was
only nabbed on the last stride at the
wire by Martin on Hipponax. The win
ner was quoted at 7 and 8 to 1 in the
betting. Bell finished fourth with
Saintly, the favorite.
If ever a horse was kind to the
bookmakers Ilorton has been. Once
more he was served up a steaming hot
favorite for the concluding mile and
a quarter, number, and again, was
beaten. Byronerdale, a 6 to 1 chance,
with Travers in tbe saddle, made the
pace from start. to finish, winning clev
erly from the favorite in 2:08%. Bell
made too much early use of Frank
Woods and ran into the show.
NOTES OPTHE TRACK.
Wally Brinkworth, who has been in
dulging in tall wagering enough to be
classed as a i lunger, ended up a profit
able afternoon with a good bet on By
ronerdale.
Dr. ilovrell's apprentice, Travers, now
looms up as a very promising rider.
He piloted two winners yesterday.
Bill Jackman decided to "kill" Byron
erdale and in consequence paid out $4200
to trie race.
C. Smith is another boy that, with
a chance, is apt to develon into a first
class rider. His one fault formerly was
getting away from the post poorly, but
he is overcoming that. Smith finished
third on Maud Muller at odds of 150
to 1, and, astride Amasa. a 30 to 1 shot,
lost by a nose only to Hipponax. *.
Why J. T. Sheehan made so much
early use of Expedient is a mystery.
The old, gelding never gathered any
thing when rushed too much the first
part of it.

BREWERS' RICE
IS UNDERVALUED
Trouble Ahead for Maier &
Zocblin of Los Angeles for
Alleged Misrepresentation
SERIOUS MISTAKE MADE
Three Hundred and Seventy-
Six Sacks Are Seized by the
Officials for Confiscation
Maier & Zoeblin, brewers at Los
Anselo?, are in difficulty with the
customs authorities over the importa
tion of S90 sacks of rice on the Gaelic,
which arrived here on February 3.
On the arrival of the steamer the bro
kers for the brewery firm certified to
the customs oHlcfals that the rice was
of the quality known . commercially
as "cracked and uncleaned."* Under
this designation the Cuty would
amount to only $225, which sura the
brokers paid. Shortly afterward the
sample sent to the Appraiser was ex
amined and was found to be first
class cleaned rice, calling for a duty
one the lot of S1550.
When the facts were reported to

HEARING OF T. F. BRENNAN
BEGINS IN POLICE COURT
Is Accused of Embezzling $37,000 From Aged Father Grey.
Edward W. Hess Pleads for Mercy, Which Must'Be De
nied-- O'Leary's Hatred of Work Gets Him Into Trouble
The greater portion of Judge Fritz's
afternoon session yesterday was de
voted to the preliminary examination
of Thomas F. Brennan, who is ac
cused of embezzling more than<$37,
000 from Father P. J. Grey, an aged
priest, who was for years pastor of
St. Patrick's Church in this city and
who has held various other outside
parishes. Brennan acted as agent for
the priest, who was infirm from age
and illness, and the defendant is al
leged to have converted to his own use
a deposit In the Hibernian Bank
amounting to the above sum.
The principal witness was Father
Patrick Powers of Livermore, who had
known Father Grey for many years.
He saw the complaining witness at St.
Patrick's Church in 1899 and at that
time the aged father was feeble and
could barely read, though he was per
fectly rational. Two years later the
witness found him in a small house
on Eagle avenue in Alameda, and at
that time Father Grey could not see
to read and was unable to assist him
self in any way. The house, the wit
ness said, was not a fit habitation for
a sick man.
The following year the witness
found Father Grey housed in a hut at
Land's End in Alameda. There was
a sign up "No Visitors Allowed." He
went around the back way and found
an old woman, who after some per
suasion, allowed him to see his old
friend. At that time Father Grey's
condition was pitiable in the extreme
tind his accommodations were of the
poorest.
In all of these visits he had great
difficulty in finding the aged priest,
as he was being continually moved
from place to place, presumably to
keep him away from his former
friends. In March, 1903, the witness
visited Father Grey in lodgings at
Bush and Steiner streets and found
him suffering from pneumonia. Wit
ness regarded the aged man's case as
hopeless. Some of Father Grey's
friends caused his removal to St. Jos
eph's Hospital, where he lives now.
Charles J. McCullom and Daniel J.
Buckley, officials of the Hibernia
Bank testified to having received or
ders signed by Father Grey, authoriz
ing Brennan to withdraw the 537,000
deposit- A draft on the Crocker-
Woolworth Bank was made out pay
able to P. J. Grey and when it was
returned it was indorsed with the
names of P. J. Grey and Thomas F.
Brennan, but neither signature was in
Father Grey's handwriting. W. J.
Thompson of the Crocker-Woohvorth
Bank, testified that Brennan had de
posited the draft in hts own name and
had drawn against it until only $24
remained to his credit on September
21 of last year, when an attachment
was served on Brennan's deposit in
a suit brought by Father Grey.
The draft on the Crocker-Wool
worth Bank was introduced in evi
dence, but only photographs of the
orders on the Hibernia Bank were of
fered and the court held that the ori
ginals must be produced. Accordingly
further hearing of the case went over
until next Wednesday afternoon.
Edward W. Hess, accused of passing
fictitious checks, came before Judge
Fritz yesterday for preliminary hearing
and at the conclusion his case was
taken under advisement until to-day.
The delay was not due to any doubt of
the defendant's guilt, for he freely ad
mitted his offense, but because the
amounts obtained were small and Hess
had previously borne an excellent char
acter.
The unfortunate man wrote a long
letter to the Judge, which is one of the
most pathetic documents that has ever
been Been in a police court. In It he
asked to be allowed to plead guilty to
misdemeanor charges, not so much on
his own account, but for the sake of
his wife and baby, who are suffering
severe privation because of his incar
ceration.
He said his crimes were committed
during a spree resulting from trouble
â with his wife's^relations. He has been
a steward on steamships for many
years and said he devoted all his earn
ings to the support of his wife and
child. He showed excellent recommen
dations from his former employers. He
said there were three lucrative positions
open to him if he were able to extricate
himself from his present trouble.
He promised to settle whatever finan
cial damage was inflicted by his opera
tions. At present he is without funds,
but he has communicated with his
mother in Germany.- who, he said, is
able and will be willing to help him.
The letter ended with a touching plea
for the Judge to have mercy on his wife
and child.
Judge Fritz was inclined to spare th<?
unfortunate man the ignominy of a
felon's sentence, but the District At
torney objected. Hess will probably
be held to the Superior Court to-day.
"William Tecumseh O'Donnell, better
known as "Bogle," was arrested yes
terday morning on Fell street by
Mounted Policeman Johnson and
charged with speeding an automobile
far beyond the lawful speed. O'Donnell
is manager of the Cole Automobile
Company and was out for an early
morning spin in a new machine.
He was before Judge Mogan yester
day and explained that the mechanism
of the new auto was somewhat un
familiar to him and for that reason
it had become keyed up to a higher
speed than he intended it should go.
When he discovered. that he was being
pursued by half a dozen mounted po
licemen he became still further '"rat
tled," but as soon as he could he mas
tered the machine and brought It to
a halt.
Judge Mogan dismissed him on con
dition that he take a course in the au
tomobile school.
Olaf Anderson, who snatched a purse
from the hands of Mrs. Rosle E. "Woeb
ber on Market street and was pursued
and captured by Policeman Dan Dris
coll, was allowed to plead guilty by
Judge Cabaniss yesterday to a charge
of petty larceny and will be. sent to
the County Jail for six months. The
light punishment was due to the fact
that Mrs. Woebber refused to prose
cute on a charge of robbery.
Elizabeth Pavnuk, the Russian wo
man who was accused by the aged
O'DonneK couple with assaulting them
In their own . home on Jessie street,
near First, was discharged yesterday
by Judge Fritz. She said that the only
time she invaded the O'Dcmnell manor
was on, an occasion when they had
built such a tremendous fire in their
stove that it threatened to set fire to
the premises.
She said she did not throw any wa
ter on the old man, but did dash some
on the fire and the smoking: woodwork
around the stove. She denied strik
ing the old man, but admitted break-
Ing his cherished blackthorn because
he was tryins to hit her with It. She
was fully- corroborated by a neighbor,
who accompanied her to the O'Don
nell domicile on the occasion In ques
tion.
Henry " Hamilton and Thomas Mur
phy,.two men with prison records and
burglar tools, were held to the Superior
Court yesterday by Judge Fritz on
charges of attempted burglary. James
Gilligen, the one-legged man who was
arrested with them, and who is said
to have aided the Folsom escapes In
their getaways, was dismissed because
no case, could be made against him.
John O'Leary's wife wanted him to
go to work, so she took him to an em
ployment agency and secured him a
job. But O'Leary refused to soil his
lily white hands with honest- toil. In
stead he asked his wife to furnish him
the mazuma to buy a scuttle full of
suds, and when she refused he as
serted his marital privilege by starting
to beat her.
When it comes to a scrap Mrs.
O'Leary is Donna Juanita on the spot
and she came back shiftily. By the
time the police reached the Clara-street
home of the O.'Learys the battle was
waging fiercely. The couple were ar
rested and they appeared before Judge
Conlan yesterday. The man was con
victed of disturbing the peace, but the
woman was allowed to go, because at
least she had not refused to work.
Tom Mulquinn and Charlie Dexter,
two of the best-known gamblers in the
West, who were arrested some months
ago in the Maison Riche by Sergeant
Christianson while they were sitting
up with a roulette wheel, appeared be
fore Judge Fritz yesterday on a charge
of visiting a gambling place and were
promptly discharged. The arresting of
ficer testified that there was no gam
bling going on at the time of â¢the raid
and he had reason to believe that none
had taken place, although the presence
of the roulette wheel suggested that
such. an infringement of the law was
then in contemplation.
Frank Sheehan, who Is a member of
a highly respectable family in this city,
but who has shown â  a tendency to go
wild and was charged with attempted
robbery before Judge Fritz, was sent
back to Jail yesterday for a few more
days' confinement. He will appear
again Saturday and will probably be
put on probation for a year. If he
sins again his punishment will be se
vere.

Another complaint has been- filed
against the phonograph parlor at 1118
Dupont street, which has recently
gained some unenviable notoriety. Pico
Giacoma claims to have lost $32 against
the "ring" game, a pastime In which
the player tries to throw a ring around
an impossible combination of pegs. Po
liceman Jack Davis arrested C. W.
Vassmer. the proprietor, and James
â Tyver and John Dullarr, two coarse
boosters. They were before Judge Mo
gan yesterday and their hearings were
set for to-day.
Mattie Reynolds was sent to the
Cc-unty Jail for three months by Judge
Mogan yesterday for vagrancy. She
was found wandering along- Third
street Wednesday night trying at one
load to portage a package that should
have been divided into seventeen parts.

SHOT TO DEATH
Michael Deegan, Thought to
Have Been Slain, but Friend
Says He Was Despondent
POWDER MARKS ON HAND
Cheap Revolver at His Left
Side and Two Bullet Holes
in Right. Side of His Head
The dead body of Michael Deegan,
until recently a member of Company
D, Twenty-second United States In
fantry, was found yesterday morning
in an open square near the intersection
of Francisco and Devisadero streets.
There were two bullet wounds in the
body, one above and the other behind
the left ear. The body lay on Its back
and a small 32-caliber revolver' of cheap
matte lay under the left hand.
The most remarkable- circumstance
connected with the affair was the fact
that the thumb, forefinger and third
finger of the left hand were .powder
burned on the inside." Dr. Bacigalupi
found the body warm and no indica
tions of rigor .mortis. Both bullets
%vere embedded' in the brain and had
taken a course at right angle* to the
skull, thus proving the impossibility
of the weapon having been' held In" the
left hand of Deegan when the shots
were fired. The powder .burns on the
inside of the left-hand, together with
the direction of . the bullets, render
the direction of the bullets, created the
belief that Deegan was. murdered and
that he received .the burns while trying
to wrest the revolver out of thehandg
of the murderer. - * â¢ â â¢- â 
Deegan was an" old soldier, having
enlisted on November 6, 1878, In the
Second Regiment of Infantry. His last
enlistment was dated May 30, 1903. He
was discharged from the Presidio Gen
eral Hospital for disability on January
18 of this year and on the same day
he drew his pay, amounting to $13,3 ol.
Only 15 cents was found when the
body was searched by Deputy Coroner
Fennell.
After having roomed at the United
States Hotel for two weeks Deegan
paid his bill last Monday and removed
his effects.
The place where the body was found
is isolated, the fence of the Presidio
baseball, grounds, cutting off the view
from the west, while on all other sides
there is a wide area of unoccupied
sand, covered with sage and lupine.
Edward . Nilson, a friend of the de
ceased, residing at the United States
Hotel, was brought to police headquart
ers last night by Patrolman James Cul
lin'ane and from his statement! the
theory of foul play was weakened.
Nilson said he had been in the army
with Deegan and met him Wednesday
evening about 7:30 o'clock in a saloon
on O'Farrell street. At that time Dee
gan appeared to be despondent, and
placing his hand on a pistol in his hip
pocket declared that Nilson would
never see him again. It is supposed
he was despondent because he had
a crippled hand.
C. H. MoslejfvandjJ. "WV Knight, ex
soldiers, v^Q^X\r&&Â¥in%CGTbpajiys-K.
Seventh Rejrroeiit^andA^ere comrades
of Deegan, both declare he has met
with foul play. They saw him a few
days ago and he was in good spirits.
They stated he was of a bright dispo
sition and a general good fellow. Mos
ley said: "There was always a laugh
out of old Bill, as we called him. He
was 'never pessimistic and got all the
fun going out of life. Somebody must
have killed him, thinking ; he had
money."
Mrs. Brunninffs Wants Money Back.
The Union Trust Company was
made defendant yesterday In a suit
brought by Mary Brunningrs, a woman
who was recently restored to compe
tency by a decree of. the Superior
Court. The suit is to compel the bank
to turn over to her $10,712 deposited
with it at the time she was declared
incompetent.

TWO CHURCHES
CONSOLIDATE
Federation of Branches in Pres
byterian Denomination Is
Announced at Banquet Table
HARMONY IN CONFERENCE
Committees Will Hold Meeting
To-Day to Formally Draw Up
the Basis of Their Union
ST. LOUIS, Feb. 18.â Official an
nouncement that the union of the
Presbyterian and Cumberland Presby
terian churches had been effected after
the labors of the committees represent
ing the two churches for the past two
days was made to-night at a banquet

mittees by the Presbyterian Social
Union of St. Louis. The basis of the
union was not given out, but will be
to-morrow after a joint conference of
the two committees, in which will be
perfected the verbal formation of the
agreement which consummates the
union.
To-morrow the two committees- will
hold a joint conference and formally
draw up the basis gf union.
One of the most prominent church
men present said that all matters per
taining to the consolidation of the two
churches had been amicably arranged
and the only question remaining deal3
particularly with the phraseologjB' of
certain prescribed forms.
"1 may sav that the sessions have
been most harmonious and the subj
committees really had very little to do
after the general committees had fin
ished their labors." said the informant,
who refused to nave his name made
public. "Of course we are all proud
of the results accomplished. It means
a greater, better, more prosperous union
of the two large Presbyterian denom
inations, and we will have a fraternal
banquet in celebration of the event."

ministers, 75a churches and 1.024,196

ters. 2944 white and 400 colored
churches and 1S4.493 white and 39,000
colored communicants. What disposi
tion to make of the colored contingent
has been one of the principal questions
to bp settled by the joint committee,
but it is understood a basis -of agree
ment has been reached. The principal
Presbyterian denominations not in
cluded in the merger are the Southern
Presbyterian church, with 230.635 mem
bers, and the United Presbyterian
Church, with 117,232 members.

LOSS IS LESS,
SAY EXPERTS
Insurance Company Agents Ac
curately Figure the Damage
Done by the Baltimore Fire
OVERFLOW OF LABORERS
Warning Is Sent Out That
There Is Only Enough Work
for the City Residents
BALTIMORE, Feb. 13.â Insurance
experts were in an optimistic frame of
mind to-day over the prospect that the
aggregate insurance loss will be much
smaller than was at first anticipated.
They are now confident the loss caused
by the conflagration will not exceed
$40,000,000, and that it will not be undt.-r
$32,000,000.
The first definite estimate they were
able to make on totals was through a
dispatch from Albany, printed to-day,
giving the losses of companies doins
business in New York, reported official
ly by them to the insurance commis
sioner of New York. This list included
sixty-eight of the largest American
and foreign companies and the total
of losses reported by them officially ia
a little over $16,500,000. Taking: these
official figures as a basis and adding
the approximated figures of the com
panies authorized to do business in
Maryland but not in New York, insur
ance men say they cannot see how ths
total insurance loss will exceed $35.
000,000.
The authorities here report that un
employed persons, particularly me
chanics, are flocking from other parts
of the country to this city by hundreds
and indications are that the volume
will steadily increase from day to day.
Those who have arrived say they cam-Â»
because they were informed that ther?
is a demand for workmen here, an<i
finding nothing to do and being without
money many of them have already aj>
plied for transportation back to their
homes.
The City Charities Department and
the Bureau of Industrial Statistics have
asked that a warning 1 be sent out that
there Is only enough work to give em
ployment to Baltimore workmen an<l
that the home workers v.ill be awarded
the preference in every instance.

"On the surface the market Ftill appeared
to be quiet, but there was nevertheless a good
business in progress, though it was confined
within jobbing limits. The feature was the
â¢trona-er feeling in California Prunes result
ing frorft the improvement In consuming de
mand, which is taken as an Indication that
buyers . have filially decided to accept the
strong reports from the Coast as- reflecting
eeiual fisting conditions there. Kales tn this
ir.arket are or small lots, rarely exceeding ein
jrle rar loads and mostly of lesser quantities.
In Peaches, outside of the moderate but steady

New York Stock Market.
XEW YORK. Fob. 13. â The etock market
dropped Into In the course of to
6ay. The urv.illingneM of the professional
traders to follow the selling movement of ye*
tr-nJzy â vz&m a striking evidence of the rigid
limitation* upon the movement of the current
market. Erea the trader* are few and limited,
end thl* tact ts accepted a* the common ex
planation of the Immobility of the market.
It 1Â« KomeWhat remarkable, however, that an
occasional Fpurt'of activity and the execution
of orders for tsome heavy blocks Â«Â»em equally
without effect on prices. The possibility la
thus suggested that the small professional
âºhare in the market may be reinforced by
Â«ome more active and powerful forces with a
purpose to keep the market in stable equilib
rium pending the working out of trther pur
poses In the financial world. Certainly there
was nothing in to-day's news to change senti
ment over the outlook for stocks. The cessa
tion of the selling was evidence, however, that
the traders were timid about declines in prices
as they showed themselves to be toward the
advance on Monday and Tuesday. The way
in which* pome very large offerings of Balti
more and Ohio and of Fennsyivania were ab
sorbed at the opening gave a suggestion of
support of a potential character that may
have Intimidated the bear element. This sell
ing was prompted by the accurate knowledge
that a definite advance toward a settlement
of the Gould -Pennsylvania conflict had mis
carried. Wabash preferred was also a euf
ferer. Another snowstorm gave warning Â«of
further impairment of railroad earnings of a
kind of which ;he Baltimore and Ohio January
statement was a discouraging example, with
its decrease In net earnings of |7S5,000 from
the preceding January. United States';Bteel
preferred showed the benefit of the more confi
dent tone of trade authorities over the outlook.
Amalgamated Copper puttered from the renewal
of the copper litigation in the New York
courts. Foreign Influences wÂ«re depressing,
but the actual transactions for foreign ac
count were on an insignificant scale. The
approach of the time for reconvening the Su
preme Court at Washington and the possibility
of an early decision in the Northern Securities
case is a possible repressive influence upon
the market. A slight recovery late in the day
wa* partially lost and the close was stagnant
at about the lowest.
Bonds were dull and heavy. Total sales,

Chicago Hoard of Trade.
Future Grain and Provisions.
CHICAGO. Feb. 18 â Wheat opened firm on
strong Liverpool cables, May and July both
being up \i,&V t c. at OS .to Â«8%c and 88% to
S9c. respectively. On the theory that the pros
pects of war complication* In Europe had been
considerably exasperated traders c with -bearish
proclivities thought wheat should bo sold on
that account. Snow drought West also brought
out selling orders. .-During the first half-hour
the market exhibited a moderatl dezree . of
weakness, and May declined to 07 Vic,, while
July sold off to SSVic. On the decline, how-.
ever, â¢ the demand became so. urgent that tht?
market readily advanced, and prices were soon
above the opening figures. Buying, after the
early decline was of a general character, near
ly all of the l.-irce houses taking that side of
the market. Domestic news was of an ex
tremely bullish nature. . Scarcity of good mill
ing wheat waa a feature. â¢ Private dispatcher
staled that millers at Interior points of Kan
sas and Oklahoma â¢ were paying fancy prices
for bard winter varieties, putting that grade
of wheat bevond the reach .of exporters.
Northwestern advices were of a similar., tenor,
Minneapolis reporting that black, smutty sam
ples Â«ild for 80SS7c a bushel. The seaboard
reported the for-iirn â¢ situation even stronger
than yesterday. With such a state of affairs
prices encountered little opposition in the
upper course. Later in the day May sold to
within V<c of the dollar mark, touching 0Â«%c
twice during the last few minutes of trading.
The clcse was strong, with May at 09%@9(>Â»4c.
July clcs^d l'/iC higher, at 90c, after selling at
00%c.
Corn .presented about the â  same appearance
as wheat, liuctuations being sharp and sudden,
with the fDeculative feeling a nervous one on
account of the 5 forelsn bltuation. There was
a good deal of corn for sale early by commis
sion houses and not much was wanted, but
later on offerines became rather limited, and
many of the early sellers had considerable
difficulty In supplying needs when prices
rtarted upward. Shorts were- fair buyers
throughout the day. and there was an urgent
demand from exporters. Aside from war.
the chief bull factor waa the scarcity of good
corn. The strength of wheat, however, helped
to supcort corn prices. The opening on May
was %c lower to higher, at 65%. to 55%o.
After decllnine to G5%655ttc the prices ral
lied to 60c, but reacted on profit taking. The
close was firm "at $5%c July closed a shade
higher, at 53Â»4Â®M%c. Local receipts were
222 cars, six of contract grade.
Oats were nervous an influenced largely by
the action of wheat and corn. Scalpers had
things about their own -way, but they were
inclined to trade on conservative lines, owing
to the uncertainty of. the foreign situation.
Opening a shade to hi to %c- higher, at 43%
(841c, May declined to 43%c, but rallied again
and closed at the top at 44c. July was un
changed at :J9%t. v
Buying for investment account and covering
by shorts, especially In May pork, I caused
! firmness In provisions. There was . a .fair
amount of liquidation in progress the'- entire
day, and at times the market showed a ten
dency to weaken, but active surioort oft the
soft soots resulted in rallies. The close was
I firm, with May pork up l7"/ic. at $15 15. 'May
i lard was 2%c higher, at $7 V7%, and ribs were
1 5c higher, at $7 25.

Poultry and Game. )
Two cars of Western Poultry were marketed,
making three for the current Week, and cleaned
up well at steady prices. Arrivals of domestic
stock continued light, and despite the heavy
receipts of Western the market ruled firm
under a continued steady demand, -and prices
of all! descriptions were maintained. Receipts
of dressed Turkeys were 16 cases, and choice
lots were readily disposed of at good prices,
while pocr and thin birds dragged, with some
very poor lots selling down to lÂ«c per pound.
The opening of the- Lenten season checked
the demand for Game and all descriptions
dragged. Receipts, however, were light and
prices were unchanged.

Butter, Cheese and Eggs.
Quotations for Butter continue to shade off, !
and even those dealers who have hitherto been \
firm on account of their light stocks have ;
turned* weak. .The market is sluggish, the de- I
mand being poor, with sellers offering their I
goods heavily in all directions. Most of the
creamery is being worked off at 25c, and any
thing over this figure is exceptional. Stocks
are larze and becoming unwieldy.
The Cheese market continues stagnant and
Weak.
.The downward tendency In Eggs continues
and tbe Inside quotations for both ranch and
store are again shaded, though the top quota- '
tlons for ranch remain unchanged. Stocks are 'â 
too heavy for the demand, which is lighter I
than It was. as the shipping inquiry has been I
satisfied for the present.

Deciduous and Citrus Fruits.
â  The Orange market continued weak, with
supplies still far In excess of the demand. The
Inquiry for cheap- fruit among peddlers and
small dealers "showed some Improvement, but
was not of sufficient volume to justify any j
advance In prices. >. Leading retailers were |
still complaining.' of the. light consumptive de- j
mand and purchased 'fla' more than absolutely .
necessary to supply the, regular trade. Only !
two cars of Navels were < In sight for the auc- >

having checked the â  triHlsment. The managers
of the auction . anntfiabed that four or flvn

MRS. C. L. FAIR
FIRST TO DIE
Dr. John Gallwcy Gives Im
portant Testimony Regarding
Condition of the Two Bodies
MAKES STRONG POINT
Says the Autopsy Proves Con
clusively That the Husband
Lived After the Accident
That Charles L. Fair's death oc
curred a few seconds at least after
that of Mrs. Fair is the positive opin
ion of Dr. John Gallwey. who. with
Dr. Williamson, performed the autop
sy on the bodle3 of the two victims
of the automobile disaster. Dr. Gall
wey was called as" an expert
witness at the hearing now progress
ing before John A. Hosmer. sitting as
court commissioner. According to the
statements of Dr. Gallwey death came
instantly to Mrs. Fair, and Charles
L. Fair undoubtedly lived a short time
after the accident.
Dr. Gallwey first told of the result
of the autopsy on the body of CharlPs
L. Fair. Although a careful examina
tion was made, no fracture of the
skull or lower Jaw â¢was discovered.
The Jaw was tightly closed and the
tongue protruded between the teeth
and was firmly grripped by them, but
showed no evidence of laceration.
This is considered a strong point by
the defense, as it is argued that Fair
must have lived long enough after
striking the ground to have placed his
tongue between his teeth. Had his
tongue been out when he struck the
ground it would have been lacerated
by the teeth, but no such laceration
is evident. In answer to a direct in
terrogatory on this point the witness
said:
"I believe th^ tongue assumed its
position after the injuries . were re
ceived and that there was a distinct
interval between Yhe time of the in
juries and that of death. During this
interval he must have been seized with
muscular convulsions which are not
unusual in cases of severe shock.
Death was due to cerebral concus
sion."
The witness disagreed with Dr. Per
riquet. the French physician who ex
amined the bodies in France and who
said he discovered a break in the cere
bral envelope in Fair's head. Accord
ing to Dr. Gallwey this would be im
possible as Dr. Perriquet had never
performed a complete autopsy. The
cerebral envelope is within the skull
and the skull was never opened until
the bodies arrived in this city.
- In the case of Mrs. Fair it was his
opinion that death resulted instantly.
The head was badly mangled and
there were innumerable fractures of
the skull. It would be impossible for
life to exist for a moment after such
terrible injuries. It would be possible
for a person instantly killed, he said,
to exhibit some muscular contractions
of the face after death, but it was not
possible in her case, owing to the se
verity of the injuries and the number
of bones broken. There is no doubt
in his mind that she received the
greater injuries of the two. The hear
jng will be resumed this morning when
Dr. Gallwey will be cross-examined.

HYDE AND DIMOND MADE
UNITED STATES PRISONERS
Are Arraigned Before Commissioner Heacock and Give
Bail for Appearance to Answer to Charges Preferred.
Mineralogist Aubury Tells of a Lieu Lind Transaction
In conformity with the indictments
found by the Federal Grand Jury at
"Washington. D. C, and with instruc
tions from the United States Attorney
General, United. States District Attor
new Wood worth yesterday drew a com
plaint against Frederick A. Hyde,
Henry P. Dimond. John P. Benson and
Joost H. Schneider, charging them with
having conspired in the city of Wash
ington, D. C. to defraud the United
States of large tracts of public lands
Jn lieu of title to school lands in Cali
fornia and Oregon. "
Within a half hour after the com
plaint had been drawn, Henry P. Di
mond walked into Woodworth's office
and asked what all the trouble was
about. Mr. Woodworth tipped a wink
to United States Secret Service Agent
Hazen, who informed Mr. Dimond that
he was under arrest. Later in the day
Frederick A. Hyde was arrested by Mr.
Hazen and United States Marshal
Shine on the same complaint. The
other defendants are absent from this
State
Hyde and Dimond were taken before
United States Court Commissioner
Heacock and gave bonds in the sum
of $10,000 each. Judge Heacock set the
examination on the removal proceed
ings for Wednesday of next week at
10 a. m. Dimond's bondsmen were
Charles R. Wheeler and W. R. Sher
wood. He was represented by Samuel
Knight, who will resist the removal
proceedings. Hyde's bondsmen were
Duncan McNee and C. C. Clay of the
Sherman-Clay Company. His attor
ney is Bert Schlesinger. It was in Mr.
Schlesinger's office that Hyde was ar
rested, the lawyer having telephoned
the whereabouts of his client.
OVERT ACT IS CHARGED.
Only one overt act is charged in the
complaint. It Is alleged that Dimond
on December 30, 1901, presented a let
ter to the Commissioner General of the
Land office, in which he appeared as
atorney for C. W. Clarke in the mat
ter of "his forest reserve lieu selection.
No. 2904, for lands in the State of
Washington In lieu of lands in Oregon
and California, thereby defrauding the
United States.
Sta,te Mineralogist Aubury, speaking
yesterday of the land transactions of
Hyde and Dimond, said the two men
named visited him some months ago
and wished him to approve of cer
tain resolutions that had been adopted
by the California Miners' Asociation in
convention, in which the convention
asked that the Secretary of the In
terior should instruct local land offi
cers to designate so-called dry lakes
in this State as prima facie saline in
character. >lÂ»";K;

certify to the Secretary of the Inte-

rior that certain lands, to the extent
of many thousands of acres in the
southern part of the State, were saline.
The purpose of this appeared to the
State Mineralogist to be somewhat ob
scure. He accordingly referred the
matter to the trustees of the State
Mining Bureau. By them, acting on
the suggestions of the State Mineralo
gist, the request of Hyde and Dimond
was turned down. . <r
Hyde,- so Aubury remembers, urged
upon him the argument that by hav
ing the desert lands declared saline
they would be kept out of the hands
of the scrippers and would be pre
served to the miners of the State. He
also said, so Aubury recalls, that he
had caused the resolution to be adopted
by the California State Miners' Conven
tion. On the face of the matter the
saline proposition appeared to be very
reasonable. The California miners had
adopted it innocently.
REFUSES TO CERTIFY.
"Had any one else asked me to have
certified that the lands were saline,"
said Mr. Aubury yesterday,- "I would
not have been suspicious of it at the
start. But when I reflected that Hyde
and Dimond were acting together and
that they were engaged in 'scrip'ping'
largely, I said that I had no personal
knowledge as to whether the lands in
certain townships were saline. I then
looked up the operations of the two
men in the land office and I discov
ered that they were taking up the des
ert school lands as agricultural and
were putting up $1 25 per acre for them.
The land was not Hvorth 15 cents per
acre. While there was some borax t/r
other salines, the quantity was small
and not worth the expense of getting
out.
"It occurred to me then that there
was a chance for a very smooth ope
ration by, Hyde and Dimond, which
was not criminal in any way, but it
might be of a sort to which the State
Mineralogist would not be supposed to
lend his aid. If the . school lands had
been declared saline after they had
been taken by Hyde and Dimond as
agricultural they could have gone to
the Government and have secured lieu
scrip, which they could have placed on
unoccupied lands ,of the Government
wherever they could find them.
â¦'I knew that they were doing a large
business in securing lieu 'scrip 1 and in
selling it. Large owners of timber
lands, like T. B. Walker, had come
into possession of great tracts of the
finest timber in California by the lieu
scrip method. If. Hyde .and Dimond
had had the scrip they could easily
have sold , It for peyefal times what the
school lands had v cbst* A them per acre
and could have cleaned up a' large sum

NEW EVIDENCE
FROM GERMANY
American Consul at Kehl Says
That Boeder's Father Died Un
der Suspicious Circumstances
BLAISE HAD LITTLE COIN
Depositions Received by Police
From Widow and Mother-in-
Law of Murdered Teuton
The father of Leon Soeder died un
der suspicious circumstances a few
years ago in Hub, Germany. Such
was the information received yester
day by the police from the American
Consul at Kehl, Baden, Germany.
Leon Soeder also attempted to get his
brother to accompany him to this
country at. the time he and Joseph
Blaise, whom he is accused of mur
dering here; came over, but the other
Soeder took sick and could not come.
The police believe that Leon either
expected to have used his brother^ as
an accomplice or intended to also take
out insurance on his life and murder
him, as they allege he did Blaise. The
investigation conducted by American
Consul Joseph I. . Brittain verifies the
theory of the police and strengthens,
the evidence already gleaned.
The fact that Soeder's father died
under suspicious circumstances, com
ing, on top of the strangeness of the.
death of Soeder's wife in Petaluma a
year ago, more strongly than ever
impresses Chief Wittman with the be
lief that Soeder is the man guilty. of
the murderer of Blaise.
The information received from Ger
many yesterday was to the effect that
Blaise had but $17 when he left home.
Soeder has always talleged that the
dead man had $200 when he left home
and $90 in his pockets when he was
murdered. Saeder claimed that Blaise
and his wife kept a hotel in Hub, Ger
many. The United States Consul
states that the family , are" poverty
stricken and never kept a hotel.
Several . letters written by Soeder
and Blaise in this country to Mrs.
Blaise show that. Blaise- did not want
to come to the United States, but was
induced to accompany Soeder on the
promise" of . a Job when he arrived
here. All of the letters written by
Blaise tell his wife of his lonesome
ness and his anxiety to get home
again.
Three of the letters were written by
Blaise to his wife, one from New
York and , two from San .Francisco;
the other letter was written by Soeder
to Blaise's wife, who is Soeder's sister.
CONSUL VISITS MRS. BLAISE.
Consul Brittain also sent a detailed
account of his visit to the home of
the widow of the murdered, man,
which bears out the theories and evi
dence already advanced in the mur
der case that Blaise had but little
money when he left his home in Hub,
Germany. Consul Brittain states that
instead of finding Mrs. Blaise in pos
session "of a hotel he found her living
with a family of six in a little hovel in
the woods. , The Consul secured deposi
tions from Mrs. Soeder, Soeder's
mother, ..and Mrs. Blaise, the wife of
the n^urdered man, ' ...
The.', letters > from the Consul in part
were as follows:
On receipt of the telegram from Chief,Witt
man on the 26th of January I wrote to. Mrs.
Blaise, Informing her of her husband's 6ad
death. The next day I went to her home near
Hub. I traveled as. far as possible by rail
and then went twelve miles by team. The
roads became bo steep . graded that I was
compelled to walk six miles. When I reached
Hub I found that Mrs. Blaise did not live
there. -
The Mayor of Hub went with me and we lo
cated the party a half mile from Hub in
a deep ravine In the heart of the woods, the
little hut being covered with enow. When I
told Mrs. Blaise of her husband's death she
appeared very much affected! There were six
of them living in the small cabin. She gave
me all the recent letters she had received
from her husband and-her. brother and said
that Joseph Blaise was sick at the time he left
home and had a pension from the Gpvernment
for a small amount. The account of Mm.
Blaise's keeping a hotel as stated by Soeder,
which I saw in The Call you sent me. is not

very poor, and did not own the little hut they
lived in."
Soeder only came as far as Avrlcourt, and
did not enter Germany, as he had not served
his military term. Blaise and Soeder's mother
met him there. It appears that Blaise went to
the United States entirely on the responsibility
of. Soeder. Soeder paid all Expenses and had
the full confidence of Blaise. â 
Boeder's mother receivd the news of the
death of her son-in-law without showing much
emotion, and there are certain unsavory re
portH as to how her husband came â¢ to his
death some years ago, so the Mayor informed
me. It appears that the family of Blaise
knew nothing of the Intended visit of Soeder
until he arrived at Avrlcourt and sent a mes
sage over Into German*- to where his mother
and Bister lived. You will notice by one of
the letters that Soeder expected to take another
Mr. Soeder, presumably his brother, with him
to. America, but this man did not go.
A .letter frdm Soeder written here
and dated December 1G told how lone
some for ills wife and children Blaise
was, and also told of the Mr. Soeder,
who did not come with them. In part
it -was as follows:*
"Dear* Mother and Sisters: "We ar
rived, in San Francisco all right, but
as yet have obtained no work. Joseph
is very lonesome, and would like work.
He inquires every day when he is go-
Ing to work. Please send .all letters
to 4S00 1 Mission street. Serpfln Soeder
got sick by eating candy, and did not
come- with-. us. That man don't want
to work, and is good for nothing. Love
to you all. The next time I come back'
I will bring the little girl to America."!
MURDERED MAX HOMESICK* Â»'
The first letter from Blaise to his
wife was written after his arrival in
New York, and in part is as follows:
"December 2, 1903â Dear Wife: Leon
made' me a life insurance policy for
55000; in my favor."
Blaise in this letter expressed a
lonsjing for his wife and children, and
wishes himself back again. In the
letters Blaise writes incessantly of
his little, daughter, whom he appears
to have loved dearly. â¦
Another letter, dated December 14,
1903, at San Francisco, was written
from Blaise to his wife. In it he ex
presses his lonesomeness and says that
he wishes his family were in San
Francisco, as the weather is beauti
fulâ"Just like "April or. May at home,"
he expresses it. He speaks of. the sick
ness of < Soeder's brother, which c-.e
terred. - him from coming to* this
country.'-, I
The ;la3t letter ever received by
Blaise's wife from her husband was
written on January 2, eight days be
fore _the man was murdered in this
city. ~" He "says: "I. am so lonesome!
Tell Marie ,J will soon be home again. I
am at horivj here day and night." Blaise
seemed- to be in a light-hearted mood
when lie wrote this letter and joshes
in 'it*. about his friends' in Hub. His
fatherly concern* for his children is
shown in the following extract from
the a letter: . .''Take good care of the
children, dear wife, and do not - let
them learn any bad language.. We will
soon be all- together again. We have
gotten no work yet. Lovingly, Joseph."
The deposition, of Mrs. Soeder, the
accused murderer's mother, is as fol
lows: : "I, the widow of. Soeder; de
clare herewith ; under , oath that I ac
companied" my "son-in-law, ; Joseph
