says the women or this weal tiiy class* *
are heavy drinkers.
"There is an immense amount of femi
nine talent and energy wasted in the
world every day." she says. "This i*
not due to the indifference or laziness
of woman, for she is eager to do, to
accomplish, to go out into the field of
life and achieve for herself and for her
kind. But she simply does not know
how. One of the most important move
ments of the day, therefore, is the re
awakening of woman, building her up
on a new basis of self help and work
for others. That movement will set
loose an amount of energy and talent
that will revolutionize our social life.
"It is absurd," Mrs. Sage continues,
"to suggest that women who have tal
ent for music or literature, or art
should be enslaved by domestic drudg
ery, while the struggle for the civiliza
tion of the world is going on.
"Drinking is indulged in to an appall
ing extent by women of the wealthy
idle class and their daughters are fol- "
lowing in their footsteps. The great
danger of this is that the idle rich
class influences the succeeding- strata
of society. This class is surrounded by
a certain glamour that those not so high

"Bear in mind that I refer* to no set

sons of this class are widely imitated.
If they drink, it is considered smart to
do so. and others follow . suit. If they
smoke cigarettes, other girls do the :
same."
. Mrs. Sage denounces gambling . as one
of the "inevitable . concomitants of Idle,
extravagant life." She tells of hostesses
politely bullying women Into games of
poker or bridge whist and making them
pay dearly. She adds:
"The trouble is that the wives pf many
men in this class squander in .gambling
and'other; forms of dissipation 'the money
their husbands, give them for household
expenses and are compelled tt> resort to

D. Fisher, who died yesterday at Bald

character? produced by thÂ« trying days
of the border warfare in Kansas and the
subsequent four years of civil war. Be
cause of his activity as a free statesman
and his association with United States

marked by the Quantrell band, and his
escape from capture and death during the
Lawrence massacre is one of the most
thrilling and remarkable incidents of that
affair.
Dr. Fi.-her was one of the few men who
ever refused a United States Senatorship.
When Senator Lane committed- suicide.
Governor Crawford announced his inten

He visited his mothers home on Satur

he intended to leave the country. The

wife after she left him and negotiated
through Nickel, his brother-in-law, is be
ileved to have so preyed on his mind that
he hoped to recoup his losses through a
raid on the bank. The cuick gathering
of people on the streets blocked his plans
and he was forced to retreat to the
vault. He burned $1500 in paper money
in the vault, but left the silver un

that he had kicked it from under him and

PEKING, Oct. 30.â The army maneuvers
which have just been completed greatly
impressed foreigners, especially those ac

expressed on all sides is that China has,
accomplished an absolutely marvelous
feat in raising an army of 40,000 men' to
Its present efficiency.
The foreign military attaches criticized
the generalship displayedâ for instance,
the absence of proper support for the
artillery, which. they thought was injudi
ciously placedâ but they gave unstinted
praise for the complete control of the
troops and the steadiness of discipline
exhibited, the latter bearing, comparison
with that of European troops*. An ob

troops lying in cover noticed that not; a

LONDON, Oct. 30.â A dispatch to the
Evening* Standard from Shanghai says
that Rear Admiral Train,; commander in
chief of the, American-Asiatic squadron,
and his son,' Lieutenant Train, have been
victims of a savage attack by Chinese
outside of Nanking. The American' offi
cers were pheasant shooting when the
Admiral accidentally shot - a Chinese
woman, slightly injuring her. Hundreds
of villagers thereupon surrounded the
officers, to*ok away their guns, knocked
the Admiral down in the mud and held
Lieutenant Train as a hostage. Forty
American marines, landed, as a rescue
party, were attacked by a mob of Chinese
who tried to pitchfork the! officers. ' . The
marines were obliged to fire twice. The
Chinese officials refused to restore the
Officers' guns and supported the villagers.
Nanking has been activtr in the move
ment for boycattinj; American goods and
is the center of activity pn the part of
the Japanese students.
WASHINGTON, Oct. SO.-Officials of .the
Bureau of Navigation of Uhe Navy De
partment were.takon aback to-day when
they learned of the attack on Admiral
Train and his son near . Nanking. They
had thought that the - Admiral was at
Wootung,*. many- miles from Nanking.
The first question asked was, did the at
tack occur In the streets, and was, it un
provoked? When the "navy officials
learned the circumstances ithey were re
lieved and said that if reports were ac
curate the landing of marines and the
forcible release of. any prisoners that the
Chinese mob had taken was Justifiable.
'\u25a0 Admiral Train uy to at late" hour has
made no report of the affair and the de
partment is surariiied at his silence.: In
t,he State Department therais worry over
the affair, as the officials; feel : that ; the
demonstration was; probably made be
cause the admiral. und his son are Amer
icans. The officials -fear .that the. affair
is part of a general hatred of Americans
because of the exclusion act, and It will
make still more dlf3cult the arranging of
a commercial treaty .-"\u25a0 with?" China, which
'has been under nejrotkitiori fora!year.
The 'State De'pa rtjnefit ha b cabled Ito the
United States Consul at Nanking,: China,
asking- particulars i; about j the, case. 1 In
view of the present' strained relations be

ST. PI3TERSBR.G. Oct. 30.â A meeting
of the etrike committee was held to-night
after the promulgation of the Emperor's
manifesto was known. The question of
calling off the strike .was discussed, but a
decision postponed until to-morrow.
A damper was thrown upon the strike
enthusiasm by the news that work had
â¢been resumed in a large part of the fac
tories of St. Petersburg. Including eleven
of the twelve departments of the Putiloff
Iron works, and that stores had been re
opened.
The eommitteemen talked boldly of
their ability to keep the men out, but. as
predicted by the press on Saturday, the
committee, probably to-morrow or Wed- j
nesday. will put a good face on their de
feat and issue a proclamation" calling on!
the strike until January.
ODESSA. Oct. SO.â lt is impossible to fix
even approximately the number of yes- .
terday's victims. The officials in charge i
of the hospitals, cemeteries and lockups ,
are strictly forbidden to give the slightest
Information. The dead and wounded,
whose numbers must be considerable,
hav^ been removed by the police and hid
den cut of sight of inquirers. The infan
try, of whose loyalty tne authorities are
doubtful, Is kept in barracks, and the
Cc-Efcccks and gendarmes, who show no
disinclination to 6hoot down people op
Bight, are left to deal with the crowds.
At one barricaded corner yesterday a
student, on the appearance of the Cos
sacks, mounted the barricade and ap
pealed to them to join the people Instead
of Rilling their brothers who were strug
gling for the freedom of their common
country. The Cossacks answered with
four volleys, killing nine and wounding
about forty persons. Scenes similar are
occurring everywhere. The crowds, flee
ing before the charging Cossacks, invade
private hou^e.< and hide in garrets and
on roofs. Many private apartments have
been converted into temporary . hospitals
for the puccor of wounded refugees.
IXFAXTRV FIRES INTO THE AIR.
J.ODZ, Russian-Poland, Oct. 30. â The

WARSAW. Russian-Poland, Oct. 30.
Thf excitement in the streets shows
no sign of abating. Xow and then the

e The police are trying: to induce the
shopkeepers to reopen their shops,
threatening to fine them If they do not

The people displayed the utmost

Then they bade the Cossacks to doff
their caps in honor of the constitution.
After 2 o'clock the patrols were with
drawn from the streets, which were
left in charge of the ordinary* night

Soon after midnight a crowd of sev

DE WITTE'S
NEW POLICY
APPROVED
ST.;. PETERSBURG. Oct. 30.â Count
tie Wltte's report to the Emperor, who I
inscribed thereon "To betaken for
guide," is as. follows;
"Your Majesty has 'deigned to indi
cate, to me directions for a Govern
ment in consideration of the actual
state of ' Russia.
"The agitation of human society ,1s
nqt the outcome of partial* imperfec
tions-ln the social and governmental
regime or of actions organized by the
extreme elements. Its roots are much
deeper. It took birth in the violation
of. the balance between the moral as
pirations and the exterior forms of
Russian society: . ,
. "BflleTlns that Rnula aspires to
lavra based oa civil liberty, the chief
problem of the Government consists In
making effective, even before approval
by the State Doumn, all elements of
. civil liberty In the elaboration of nor
mal leelMlative measures, Riving; equal
ity before the lam to all Russians
without distinction* of race or religion.
;""The problems ensuing consist In the
establishment, of legislative forms
seeking to guarantee the benefits of
civil, political and economic liberty.
These benefits should be extended to
'\u25a0 the masses of the people under the re
serves safeguarding the laws in all
civilized countries.
"It must be realized, then, that these
objects cannot be attained immediately,
as no Government could suddenly pre
pare 135,000,000 men with a vast ad
ministration.-for new liberties. It Is,
therefore, necessary to have the powers
of a homogeneous government united
in its extreme, taking care to put into
practice' the stimulating principles of
liberty and* to display sincerity and
uprightness in its Intentions. 3
"The Government â¢ should abstain
from any interference with elections to
the Douma, and keep in view my sin
cere desire for the realization of the
ukase of December 25. 1904. It must
maintain the prestige of the Douma
and have confidence in Its labors, and
in no wav resist its decisions. so long
as they are not inconsistent with Rus
sia's historic greatness.
: "It is necessary to. respect the ideals

of the Standard at Moscow sends the
following account of the occurrences of
recent. days there: .
"On 1 Friday and Saturday a dozen
meetings of different parties sat in con
stant session in different \u25a0> halls of the
university, numbering altogether proba
bly 30.000 persons.
"On Saturday night the rector appealed
to the Prefect to protect the university
buildings against attacks Instigated by
the Moscow Gazette and the monarchial
party, which appealed through the priests
to all true Russians to unite to beat the
students and rebels. Tbe Prefect sur
rounded the entire university district
with a strong cordon lof troops, while
the students erected Oormldable barri
cades at every sate aÂ«d organized their
defense with military precision. The
monarchist 'Black lljundred," . in the
meantime, waited outfllde for any stu
dents venturing to leaxie the precincts.
"This siege continued until Sunday
night, when after negotiations the be
sieged marched out, escorted by dra
goons, who kept the 'Black Hundred* oft
until the students were, able to diapers*
; safely.
"A great meeting of delegates of all
parties sat -In the town hall from Satur-

starting'of the water works after Mos
cow had been deprived of water for
thirty-six hours.
"Sunday was signalized by a blinding
snowstorm, and the condition, of the

known as ficQtty. the Death Valley
tniner. who a few weeks ago attracted
wide notice by a record run in a special
train over the Santa Fe Railroad from
Los Angeles to Chicago, was seriously,
if not fatally, injured in an automobile
accident here to-night. J. Davidson, a
newspaper reporter, and Harry Milling,
proprietor of the Imperial Cafe, were
alÂ£O injured In tbe accident.

that the trip could be made in forty
minutes. On the return Journey, while
leaving 1 the approach to tha wagon
bridge at Ely^ian Park, tbe tire from
one of the rear wheels came off. The
wheel was smashed and the* automobile
swerved and upset. Scott and David
â¢oa were thrown against the stone abut
ment of the bridge. Scott was seriously
injured about the head, back and shoul
ders and was taken to his home. His
body is ra-ralyzed from the waist down.
The physicians' examination disclosed a
severe concussion of the epine and a
fracture of the iliura. It is possible that
he may have a broken vertebrae. It is
the opinion of the surgeons that he is
fataily injured.
Davidsoa was eeriously injured about
the head and shoulders and was rendered
unconscious, and was removed to the re
ceiving hospital. He will recover. Mill

c "I am done for at last," moaned Scott
as he lay on a couch at his home cov
ered with" dirt from head to foot, await
ing -the arrival of the physicians. "My
bsick is broken and I feel all smashed to ;
pieces. We were going seventy miles an .

was called as a witness, and at which
time he made a confession of his where

ATTITUDES OF JOHN S. PARTRIDGE IN EARNEST PLEAS FOR CITY'S SALVATION.
HUNDREDS OF WORKINGMEN
HEAR FUSION LEADER.
.Partridge Talks to Voters in Three
Districts and Is Cheered.
Significant Outpouring of Laboring Men
Means Defeat of Ruef.
San Francisco to the nprth and to
I the south of Market street turned out
last night to listen to John S. Part
ridge in- his campaign for decency and
purity in politics and municipal gov
ernment. Voters in the Twenty-eighth,
Twenty-ninth and Thirty-ninth dis
tricts packed the halls in their several
districts, while the men at the Union
Iron Works gathered in large numbers
yesterday noon to hear the fusion lead
er. At all meetings the candidate's re
ception was cordial and respectfuL
The Schmitz' men in the audience lis
tened with attention and refrained
icpm interruption. The Partridge men
in' all the places outnumbered the fol
lowers of the opposition, significant
from the fact that the meetings were
held in union labor strongholds.
But one unpleasant feature marked
the candidate's journey through the
district in which he spoke. Outside
each hall were gathered crowds of
youths averaging from 15 to 20 years,
who. were led by a few grown men in
hurling insults and hooting Mr. Part
ridge. The men who led the rabble in
the Twenty-eighth were actively en
gaged In disturbance outside the hall
in the Twenty-ninth.
. In the Thirty-ninth, where that sec
tion of the city will throw off the yoke
of an unspeakable petty district boss,
the famous "steam beer" boys gath
ered outside the hail to create disturb
ance under the instigation of ? their
grafting leader, and it was only the
presence of mounted police and the de
termined front of Mr. Partridge's sup
porters that saved him from personal
assault on his way to the car.
Tie meeting that took place in Mont
gomery Hotel in the Twenty-eighth
District was jammed to the doors with
workingmen and their wives and
sweethearts. William Harrington pre
sided over the meeting and made an
efficient chairman. He Introduced as
the first speaker a nun well known in
district. Daniel A. Ryan.
DISSECTS LABOR TICKET.
Ryan was applauded and told the work
ingmen some facts regarding the labor
ticket that opened their eyes. He told
them Â«f the employment of Samuel W.
Horton, the Union Labor candidate for
Auditor, on an afternoon paper writing
ccreedÂ« for the Citizens' Alliance against
the unions. He told them of Stulz, the
candidate for Public Administrator, over
whom the unions fought for a year to get
him to unionize his shop. He also told
them, of Max Mamlock, a man who has
lived thirty-four years in America arid
only became naturalized four months ago,
when there was a prospect of holding of
fice.
Ryan then referred to the Mayor's
stand on the union Question and his be
trayal of labor leaders whenever Ruef
pulled the string. He spoke of the dis
missal of Michael Casey, of D. L Ma
honey^ of the hiring' of scab labor and
the refusal of P. H. McCarthy to declare
a etrlke among the bricklayers, who are
compelled to handle the scab material
made, by non-union men in the yards of
3ray Brothers.
At the conclusion of Ryan's speech Mr.
Partridge entered. When presented he
was loudly cheered, and men at the back
of the hall raised shouts for Schmitz.
Partridge told the audience a: few truths
ibout the grafting of the present admin
stratlon, about the incompetent Board
3f Works, the rotten Board of Health,
the partisan Election Commission' and the
political Police Commission.
He told them of the herding of poor
men In the wards of the disease-ridden
City and County Hospital. He promised
them a new hospital and that sick men
should not be herded to the primaries to
rote for a political boss. He also prom
st<2 his hearers to put honest men on the
.-arious commissions.
\u25a0"l^ra. looking for honestmen," declared
Mr. Partridge, "and I want you to bring
.hern to me and in the filling of a vacancy
le will get an equal show with the pro
:cs;e of a faction." He urged his hearers
aot to [vote for an administration that is
riving them the best of it. "For," con
rluded the candidate, "while you are get
ting the best of It some other man gets
the worst of it, and you never know but
tvhat It'll be your turn next."
IX THE TWK.VrV-XWfTH. .
P Walking over to the Manzanita Club
til. at 203 Perry street, Mr. Partridge
was accompanied by many of bis follow
ers of the Twenty-eighth," but on arriving
tJt the hall in the Twenty-ninth It â¢ was
found to be overflowing, and; it was, with
difficulty that Partridge made his en-
trance. Here again at the back of the
hall were many Schmitz men, who raised
counter cheers for their leader, but other
wise behaved well and listened atten
tively. If Mr. Partridge can set men
like these to thinking on his words the
doom of Ruef and Schmitz is irrevoca
bly sealed.
The fusion leader's stay at the hall
was of short duration. He spoke there
several a minutes upon the subject of
graft and corruption. He told his hear
ers of the shameful way labor has been
treated by the present administration
and of the needs of. the workingmen in
relation to the disposal of the bonds
for building up. .San Francisco. , He
closed with the. promise that all would
receive fair treatment at .his hands
and that none would get more or. less
than he deserved.
From the Twenty : ninth District Part
i ridge jumped across town. to the "Thir
ty-ninth to a packed meeting at Rich
mond-Hall. Here the crowd was so
I dense that the stairways and entrance
were jammed- to suffocation and several
of the speakers, including Coroner. T.
B. W. Leland, were unable ; to make
their way to the platform. Outside
could be heard the voice of the youths
shouting for Schmitz, but it is doubt
ful whether there were more than a
score of. votes for the Ruef leader in
the hail.- â¢
Prior to the arrival' of Mr. Partridge
Chairman Edward McMurray intro
duced Fairfax Whelan, Henry U. Brand
denstein. General C. A. Woodruff,' Frank
H. Gould and E. B. Cutten, who made
short addresses. Mr. Partridge, after
prolonged cheers, spoke as follows: .
COXFIDEXT OF .VICTORY.
We have entered! upon We last week" of the
campaign confident of the. almost certain sac- -
cess of our whole ticket. Night after night
the meetings have crown larger and the crowds
more enthusiastic. The progress .of the fight
has strengthened the stern resolve of the peo
ple. The whispered and published falsehoods
of our enemies have found no I one to believe
them. The brazen attempt of the adminis
tration to array class against class is bring
ing its own punishment.
Perhaps the most important business a new
administration will have to transact aside from
the task of regenerating the city government
will be the sale of the bonds and the proper
expenditure .of the money to be derived there
from. This eubject has been discussed in a
general way, but I want to tell you Just now
it stands.
While the question of the validity of the
bonds of the city and county of San Francisco
was pending before the Supreme Court of the
State of California the Mayor announced pub
licly In the chambers of the Board of Super
visors that -In the event of the bonds being
declared valid he had a purchaser for the
entire issue of nearly $18,000,000. Subsequent
ly, through the columns of the public press,
he* spoke in the same vein. The members of
the Board of Supervisors were led to .believe
that the bonds would bÂ£ readily disposed of.
WORK TO BE DO.YE.
Mission Park waa the first land acquired.
Then followed rapidly many parcels In tlie
Park and Presidio . Extension. Numerous con
demnation suits were instituted against prop
erty owners who. refused to, accept the city's
appraisement, . and the entire matter jof . the
acquisition of the . lands has been pressed fo
determinedly that now but little more than
one-fourth of the Park Extension remains to
be acquired. , \u25a0 - - â¢ . .
The same thing applies -to the school lands
and to the library lands. The library block,
with the exception of one small subdivision, it
now the property of the .city and county,, ana
a number of school lots have ' been f purchased
from I time to time and this matter fe is welt
under way. :...â¢-\u25a0 , -
Moneys were 'available for. the construction
of- schoolhouses and for the purchase of school
lands about the Ist of March,' lt*os. .â¢
Although repeatedly requested by the Super
visors to file plans, specifications and details
of new school buildings the. Board of. -Public'
Wdrils failed to. submit a single plan . until
about the middle of May., 1005, when - plans
for. alterations >and repairs to the Crocker
Grammar School were flledj The Board of
Supervisors at once authorized the expenditure
of $17,500. the amount set aside in the bona
issue for this purpose and ordered the doing of
the work.

expended has been for lands. The Supervisors

and In spite of the fact that real estate . values
have Increased : enormously we â¢ haye \u25a0 succeeded

zens that it promptly issues this. warning to voters: . *
FUSION COMMITTEE ISSUES WARNING
TO THE VOTERS OF SAN FRANCISCO: . " . ' . '
The rumor has persistently come to us that it is possible to tamper -with the voting machines' which will be used at the comins:
election, and that it is the intention to steal the election in this manner. While w* have at all times insisted that we believed the ma
chines to be entirely accurat*. we could not ignore th^se ' statements. " and have therefore done everything to prevent any one tamper-
Ing with the machines. We have arranged for a thorough Inspection of every machine, and also for having them guarded. ?o as to
make it impossible for any one to tamper with them before election. In this we have been assisted by the manufacturers of the ma
chines, and the Grand Jury U performing the same duty. . . \u25a0 â¢\u25a0 v
But we now find that there is!a very-simple way in which the machines can be tampered ..with /and the election stolen, which
cannot be discovered by either of these methods, and whfch can only be avoided by the watchfulness; of the voters themselves. A mere
statement of the simplicity of the method and the Impossibility, of detection -will show how easily the- election might have" been stolen
unless it had been discovered in time: The scheme is briefly -this: A voter goes to the machine to vote, throws the lever over, which
closes .the curtain and conceals. him from view. lie then'places around the \u25a0 key .over the-name of . the -candidate ! heÂ» desjres to. injure
an ordinary small : rubber band "and stretches It. to an â¢adjoining key. lie can do this and vote" In thirty seconds, thus causing no sus
picion. He then goes out.. leaving this rubber band in the- position Indicated. The result Is that when the next voter goes to the ma
chine and attempts to vote, for the candidate whose key has the band around it -by; using. the t party, lever, this key goes down as It
should, but. as soon as the party, lever Is released goes back into place., Deing drawn up by the -rubber band; and the result Is that that
candidate is not voted for. Themachlne might continue .in. this condition for any. length- of time 1 without, detection. -The band is hidden
from view and would'only bt; detected upon - the closei-t Inspection. -That the.'ordlnary voter would, never notice that. the key did not re
tain its proper position it' ls < only necessary to say that thÂ«- local agent of the ; machine' did _ not . notice It and believed he had voted a
straight ticket, although he had been warneJ'that' the machine had been tampered' with. . ' - ' J_
This publicity is made, to -prevent any. such attempt. .-'When, you vote see that after, you -â¢ have released the party lever all the
pointers remain down. If otic of them goes back into place you may. know that the machine, has been 'tampered with. No one but
the voter can detect the Imposition, and you must be . the guardians of ..your own vote. -If you take care in this particular we can
assure you that your vote will be counted, for we believe- that the machines themselves are Jn -every way- accurate. Look. out for the
rubber band! ->j ' , \u25a0 '"\u25a0â¢ â¢â¢\u25a0 ' 'FUSION CAMPAIGN COMMITTEE.

â¢ him and for him, and want to hear the
message that he gives to the men and
women of San Francisco.
Confidence in the success of the fusion
ticket is so complete that all the devices
and methods of poolroom politicians to
sustain the betting odds against Part

good the talk of big odds that Schmltz

of this strong fusion district from ex
pressing their franchise by locating the
polling place for the voters In the more
populous Thirteenth Precinct at the ex
treme western edge of the Fourteenth, a
distance of at least a mile from the cen
ter of population. The feeling is such
that the expression of voters is that they
intend to vote if they must walk to the
Cliff House. Ninety per cent of this pre
cinct is for Partridge. â¢ i
The Fourteenth Precinct of the Thirty
ninth, which Maestretti boasts he can de
liver, is slipping away so rapidly that his
followers are now claiming only 40 per cent
for Schmltz. But the Thirteenth win re

the absurd voting booth location by lining
up en masse for the fusion ticket.
Albert M. Armstrong, who was formerly
a collector of bad debts, but who Is now
the principal of the Hancock Grammar

It is gossip in the camp of the grafters
that Armstrong is to be appointed. Super

There was a full house delegation

Yiconde de Villa Verde Wins
Hand of Maria 31. Fisher,
Daughter of Restaurateur
OAKLAND, Oct. 30.â After having
braved the galaxy of court beauties
about the ruler of the throne of Portu
gal, a man claiming to be Viconde de
Villa Verde has fallen a victim to the
charms of a fifteen-year-old maiden,
and the marriage of. the pair will be
celebrated with great eclat Wednesday
evening at Father Gallagher's church
in West Oakland. The bride is Maria
A*. Fisher, the daughter of a West Oak
land restaurateur.
Owing to 'the youthfuiness of the
bride, it was necessary for the father
to accompany the groom to the County
Clerk's office before a marriage license
would be issued and- he seemed highly
pleased with the prospect of having
the Viconde for a son-in-law. The dis
crepancy of the age of the groom,
which was given at 44 and that of the
bride did not seem to bother either of
them.
It is claimed by the groom that lie
was attached to the throne- of Portu
gal for some time and that he is a
nobleman and came to America to learn
the Engwsh language and customs and
stayed to be ensnared by a beautiful
native daughter.

PILFERING CO-ED'S
NAME IS KNOWN
Miss Pritchard, a Freshman,
Catches Her in Act of
Breaking Into a Locker
INVESTIGATION IS BEGUN
Students Affairs Committee
Will Try to Learn Iden
tity of the Guilty Girl
BERKELEY, Oct. SO.â The students af
fairs committee of jthe University of Cal
ifornia this afternoon secured the first
definite clew to the Identity of one of the
thieves who have been systematically
robbing the lockers of ' the women stu-'
dents in the Harmon gymnasium, and an
investigation has been begun by the com
mittee, which will probably result in the
clearing up > of the mystery - and the ex
pulsion of a feminine member of the ju
nior class. - . \u25a0 .-..\u25a0â¢
The students' affairs committee is de
termined to stamp out this evil, and in
this determination the members' of -the
committee are backed by -the executive
committee of , the Associated Students.
During a meeting of the students' af-.
fairs committee this afternoon a report
was received by the members of the com
mittee that one of the guilty parties was
known, to Miss E. K. Pritchard, a.fresh
man in. the college of social sciences, who
resides at 255 Hartford street, San Fran
cisco. Inquiry proved this to be a fact,,
but so. far. the identity of the culprit has
not been discovered.
FOUND BREAKING LOCKER.
Accident led to the discovery of the cul
prit, by Miss Pritchard last Thursday,
when she found a young woman who is
a member of the junior class in the act
of breaking into her locker in the gymna
sium. .
Realizing that denials were useless, the
culprit. burst into, tears and begged Miss
Pritchard not to expose her, and the lat
ter, knowing that exposure wotjld mean
expulsion from the university and lasting
disgrace to the pilferer, finally promised
neither to prosecute the guilty one. nor to
reveal her name, but the secret leaked
out and. the story came to the ears of the
students' affairs committee this after
noon. '
Miss Pritchard has so far steadfastly
refused to make known the identity of
the guilty student, but the members of
the committee, feeling that an example
should be made of the thief, have begun
an investigation and are confident that
the name of the guilty one will be
learned. - .
MEETING OP COMMITTEE.
The facts, so far as they are known to
the students' affairs committee, have been
reported to .the executive committee of
the Associated Students, and the latter
will hold a meeting to-morrow afternoon
for the purpose of continuing the investi
gation. *
The first of- the thefts which have
stirred so much feeling among the co-eds
of ; the university began several weeks
ago, but for a time the .value of the ar
ticles stolen was so small that the matter
was only known to a few .of the stu
dents. When 555 -was stolen from, the
lock.er of Miss S. E. Levy a short time
ago,.' however, .the continued thefts were
reported to" the students^ affairs commit
tee, and that body- at once began an .in
vestigation. No clew.tb the guilty, parties
was found, however, â¢\u25a0 and the pilfering
continued, finally resulting in the discov
ery of one of the culprits by Miss Pritch
ard.-

Eugene Brunei and Jean Lemebeye Go
Hunting and Are Missing
Eugene Brunei, son of Mr. and Mrs.
Brunei, who keep a French laundry at 133
Fifth street, and Jean Lemebeye. an em
ploye at the laundry, left the city early
Sunday morning to go hunting, and prom
aseil to return in the afternoon. Neither
aad been seen nor heard of up to a late
aour last night, and the parents of Eu
rene and the youn? wife of Jean were al
r.cst beside themselves, despairing of
tvor seeing their loved ones again.
Three weeks ago they purchased a row-
Soat, and having painted and made her
wok trim went Sunday to Hunters Point,
loping to enjoy a few hours' sport. They
took Mrs. L^mebeye's dog and some mea
rer refreshmentsâ enough to tide them
jver until the time they had set to re
:um.
When evening came and there was no
lipn of them there was much uneasiness.
They were awaited the whole of the
sight, and when morning came with no
tidings the relatives hastened to Hunters
Point, but learned only that the missing
ones had been seen about 2 o'clock Sun- I
day afternoon in the vicinity of the point.
After that nothing was known of their
movements.
The Brunei- family and the distracted
\u25a0wife of Lemebeye then made a search of
the country round and remained out in
vestigating until darkness overtook them
and made further endeavor at search
well nigh impracticable. They had also
reported their loss to the police.
Last night Mrs. Brunei and Mrs. Leme
beye determined that early this morning

A Vital Question Fraught Wiih
\u25a0 Interest to San Fran-
cisco People,
r
When a citizen right here at home
makes a public statement like the fol-
lowing, ail room for doubt disappears
and the most skeptical must be con-
vinced. It's pretty hard for our read-
ers to prove a statement made by a
stranger living in some far-away
point of the Union, but the endorse-
ment of neighbors, friends and- citi-
zens is the best of proof; no better
evidence can be had.
J. A. Kell, retired, of 605 Broadway,
says: "For a year or more my back
was weak and ached continualiv: not
severely enough to lay me up, but it
.certainly was very disagreeable. I
knew the cause of mv trouble from
the action and condition of the kidney
secretions, but what to do to stop it
was a mystery. I came to California in
1853; the greater part of my life has
been spent in mining, an occupation
decidedly hard on the constitution,
and when attacks of kidney complaint
affect a man it is more difficult than
ordinary to remove. Doan's'Kidney
Pills certainly stopped my backache.
It is now some seven or eight months
since I stopped the treatment, and at
the present time I have not a -sign or
anything wrong with my kidneys."

DO NOT TRUST
HEALTH BOARD
Supervisors Name University
Food Experts to Msike In
qiiiry Into the Milkj Supply,
ALLAY PUBLIC FEARS
People Show Lack of Con
fidence in ,: Department
Handling Dairy Inspection
That the 'people of ./. San f Franclflco
have no confidence In the. Board of
HoaV:h was demonstrated yet.terday at
the meeting of the Supervisors . when
that body 'ordered an independent In
vestigation >; of the ' milk supply of the
city to be made by proresitdrs of the
University of California. Further, evi
dence of the lack of esteem' 'in which
the 'Health Dcpartnienfi Is . held \u25a0 was
manifest from the fact that not a
Klnjcle . phyniclau In ' San Francisco : re- ,
sponded to the board's -Invitation to
help- alone; ltti appeal . for more money
from the: Supervisor*.
To allay public fear and. alarrri over the
conditions" arourfti the dairies U and the
milk supply' the Supervisors have appro
priated *525 from the urgent' [ necessity
fund to m.eeVthe expense 1 of an - inquiry by
scientists,' which ; will be conducted dj t ,
Professor ' A. R. Ward, director of .the
State , hygienic laboratory at : ; Berkeley,
"and Professor M . E. Jaffa, one of ; the
leading food experts in the United States.
These gentlemen will make their expert
investigation with their own '.assistants,
who will be selected by themselves. No
Health Department official or employe
will have anything to do withHhe choice
of the men; They will be free: from bias,
prejudice or personal sentiment that
might be detrimentalto the proper prose
cution of the work. â¢?
FOOD EXPERTS NAMED.
The resolution appointing Â» thes^ men
was fathered by Supervisor ; d'Ancona,
who made it broad enough. \u25a0 It recites
they are to inspect the dairies 'and to in
vestigate the milk industry of. the city.
Provision is made for the inspections and
for chemical and bacteriological exami
nations of milk.
â¢ And that was the Board of Supervisors',
response to Health Officer D. F. Ragan'a
plea for ?3000with which to continue its
milk "crusade."
When the Board of Health's petition for
coin with which to boost Its already
heavy list of employes. was taken up yes
terday afternon by the Supervisors, D'An
cona.a member, of the Commit
te.c, directed his colleagues' attention to
the absence of the medical men and many
others who had been invited to attend and
lend their "moral support."
Health Officer Ragan admitted that the
Board of Supervisors had allowed $12,000
for laboratory, work in connection with
milk. -
.."There seems to be a public demand for
an extension of the milk inspection and
analyses," said R.agan, "and the addition
al sum is necessary in order to allay the
uneasiness of the people. We cannot af
ford to cripple our inspections :of other
foods. There ( Is no eligible list of milk
inspectors, but we will take two eligibles
from the food inspectors' list, at $100 per
month'each. We will select two assistant
chemists . from, the Berkeley . University, 1
who are well versed in the analysis of:
milk, at $85 per month each: This will re
quire $2960 in the next. eight months. We
do not. want to abandon dairy Inspection,
but will have, to do so if we continue the
analyses of milk samples as we have
done in the past two weeks." ! .
PUBLIC ALARM OVER MILK. ;
' "There is unquestionably . great public
alarm about the milk supply in this city,"
said Supervisor d'Ancona, "and this board
Btands ready to aid in allaying the, fear
that may be entertained by the people.
It seems to me that no matter how large
an appropriation we may make there will
still be a fear in the popular i mind that
the employes of the Health Department
are not making as systematic an inspec
tion of the jnilk supply as It is possible to
make." \u25a0 \u25a0 '] !
Dr. d'Ancona, protesting he meant no
reflection on the Health Department, read
his resolution, which so drastically takes
the work out of Health Department
hands. ' .
Ragan, replying to . Supervisor Gal
lagher's question, said he objected to. the
plan, as it would appear as though the
Board of' Health is not competent to
handle the work^ :
Supervisor d'Ancona concluded: "We
intended to appoint Professors: Ward and
Jaffa; because they are free from political
and other inlluences which might militate
against theh report."

DECISION UPHOLDS
TRUST ANNULMENT
Probate Judge Coffey Gives
Opinion That Opens a Way
for Improvement oi More
Tlian One Thousand Acres
The Adolph Sutro trust, ;by which
1150 acres of land in \ the heart. of; San
Francisco were withheld from sale or
improvement for ) â¢ an indefinite '" period,
has been annulled by ' Probate " Judge
James V. Coffey on a' decision handed
down yesterday, Which grants the heirs'
petition for distribution of that portion
of the great estate which was tied in
the trust. '
Lands valued at more than $2,000,000
are involved. In area they represent
fn round numbers one-tenth of *all: of
the land areas of San Francisco, ex
clusive of parks and' military reserva-^
tion. Every foot of this great tract is
unimproved and,; lies in , remarkable
.wildness,- stretching from Golden Gate
Park southward to the old .industrial
school and; the Almshouse, lying weet
from Twin i Peaks and running . ocean
ward by the Dewey; boulevard. \u25a0.
- Besides this tract the Sutro Heights
home site at the Ocean Beach, includ
ing; forty acres of land,, is \ affected by
the decision, for it was covered by the
trust clause. The largerpiece is a part
of the Southern San Miguel . rancho,
and was bought many years ago by
Adolph Sutro when- the "Sunset". Dis
trict was nuught but adrcary waste of
sand dunes. Sutro;held to' this princely
domain, and during his lifetime 7 little
of it was sold. It Is practically intact
and can readily be partitioned to, Su
tro's six children, who will share in
equal portions the' enormous holdings
if the decision of Judge. Coffey be sus
tained. The heirs * who "attacked . the
trust .were Kate Sutro Nussbaum, Mrs.'
Rosa Victoria Sutro Morvio, Edgar E.
Sutro and Clara Sutro ; English.;: The
trust was defended by Dr. Emma Sutro
Merritt, a daughter of Adolph, who is
theexecutrix under, hiswijland also a
trustee of the trust. W. R. H. Adamson,
an execu tor, is dead! Charles Â« W. Sutro,
a son, took no part in the litigation.

' The history of thercontest over the

*iio strings on;his coin. ;*.' <
Sutro therefore named his executor
and executrix as "the first trustees.

attempt had been made to create a
great charitable endowment
.At the time. Judge Troutt gave his
decision the appraisement of the trust
properties; was placed at $770,000, but
the steady increase in values in the city
has . raised the lands' to well around
$-.000,000. This figure represents the
value as the holdings stand ; to-day.
What ''they will be; worth fifty years
hence after partition, sale and improve
ment is a matter; beyond the realm even
of speculation/for the area covered by
the lands is rapidly becoming more
and more valuable. .
Judge Coffey's opinion yesterday goes
first into the question of the validity
and effect of J udge : Troutt' s judgment
annulling the trust. In., commenting
on that aspect of the petition for dis
tribution Judge Coffe>% reviewed, the ar
guments of the petitioners, and
ponents ;. touching the point of juris
diction of the "equity court to pass upon
theTtrusti';. His Honor held 'that there
was jurisdiction.' He recited from; the
Troutt- opinion to "show, .that "the. at
tempted trust was intended .for purr,
poses other than charitable and not
authorized; by the law, and that : the
trust provisions are uncertain In that
it cannot be determined -what propor
tion ofjhls estate the testator, intended
.for -charitable purposes and . what for
other purposes. Judge Coffey con-,
eluded: . ; ; '
tio appeal was taken from . that judgrrnent.
and , if the court In : equity was competent to
pronounce 'U nothing remains for. this tribunal
but ' to ' acqutiesco In Its conclusion. ' The only
question, .therefore,* to be determined* is the
question of eÂ«iuity of the court_.to deliver. that
Judgment. . , . . \u25a0 '\u25a0 ' \u25a0
The-wlll undertakes to create a trust for

EDUCATING THIEVES/
?â¢\u25a0;â¢;\u25a0;' - - :â¢\u25a0â¢â¢â¢ , ... \u25a0\u25a0- -\u25a0-.
THE detectives are complaining that the catching of thieves is,
becoming all the time more difficult. When a criminalis once
subjected to the Bertillon system of measurement, his after iden
tification is easy, provided he can be^jaught. The thieves used to
educate the detectives. The crimifjg^&'ay was studied by the offi
cers, clews were inquired into and education was not-com
plete until it included, all of the criminal ways and idiosyncrasies.
The burglar, stage robber, train robber and bank robber left his
mark behind him in the way the job was done. The. detective could
tell whether it was the work of an amateur or a professional. He
had some idea, of the covert that would.be sought after the crime
was committed, and by a study of the clews furnished by the crim
inal could trace him very accurately.
But while the thieves were educating the detectives the detec
tives were educating the thieves, until tiow in the trial of wits the
thieves have the best of it. It is for this reason that, several of the
rather heavy robberies of Wells- Fargo in this city and State com
mitted during the last two years remain an unsolved mystery.
.Years ago it is probable that the man who held up the Yosemite
stage would have been found in a few days. But he did his work;
and disappeared as completely as if the earth had opened and swal
lowed him. He had learned the art of leaving no clew and there
was not a trace of anything left where the crime was committed,
not even a legible track of the foot, by which he could be traced.
The same is true as to the murder of Messenger Haskell, which will
go unavenged because the detectives have educated the thieves, j
The conviction of the robber of the Central Bank messenger in Oak
land, indeed his identification and arrest, depended not upon clews,
but upon the accusations of a prisoner who had been" his pal.
The thieves formerly educated the detectives unwittingly and
unwillingly. They did not know they were doing it. They would
never have known and the process would have continued indefinitely
and detective skill would have constantly gained, keeping pace with
criminal ingenuity, had it not been for human vanity. When an
officer made a big catch he was bursting to tell how he did it. For
getting that his acuteness was sufficiently certified by the presence
of his prisoner, whom he had landed, he desired to bask in the lime
light and be known as a second Vidocq.
Therefore he told all about his clews, his method of interpret
ing them, how he followed them, how he reasoned out what the
criminal would do, and applied his own ingenuity to his conclusions.
Newspapers will publish news, and when a detective was so full of
liis exploits nothing could prevent it from spilling into the press.
Now all such matter is closely studied by criminals. It is to them
a book of "don'ts."' They get into the detective mind through the
study of his descriptions, just as the detectives formerly got into
the criminal's mind through studying the material unconsciously
'supplied by himself, for his own undoing.
Some people say it is the fault of the newspapers. It is not.
The matter is furnished for publication. Those who furnish it would
resent its suppression. It appeals to their vanity and makes them
more notorious white less useful in their calling. We do not recall
an instance of any great detectives rushing into print to tell how any
of their great catches were made. They were content that the
public knew the result. How it was attained was part of their pro
fessional confidence and equipment. After the arrest of Black Bart,
which was effected by the laundry mark on a handkerchief dropped
W him 'at the scene of the robbery, laundry marks became of the
greatest importance in identifying criminals. But the matter was
publisher! everywhere. Now it is said that thieves carry no laundry
marks-, on their clothing. The detectives exposed that means of
identification and taught the thieves to quit furnishing such a clew.
So it has come to pass that the professional criminals have
ceased to educate the 'detectives, who have- become the schodl
masters of the criminals, through over-vanity. We by no. means
say that this is true of all detectives, but it is true of enough of them
t<Â» increase the difficulty of criminal identification and detection for
them all. The successful detective now must be highly endowed.
The material lie* works with is more subtle than ever. If he is wise
he will never give away his methods, to become the means of in
structing criminals in the arÂ£ of not getting caught.
AUSTRIAN TROUBLES.
RULING over peoples of different nationalities who will not
merge to the extent of adopting a common language, is one
of the . tribulations of the good old King-Emperor, Francis
Joseph of Austro-Hungary, and the difficulties of playing the role
are now getting quite acute. So serious are the disagreements of
his subjects that it is supposed only the power of- his personal popu
larity holds them in willing unity. If he should die there is no one
who could take his place in such sovereignty of sincere affection as
would hold his empire of such varied race and language in even such
strained union as exists at the present time.
A curious feature in the present row in Hungary which he is
now trying to becalm is that it is really a minority of the Hun
garians who are making the trouble. They demand that the Hun
garian troops be commanded in words of the Magyar tongue in
stead of in German, as is the rule now, and as is the wish of the
Emperor in order that there may be unity of language in his empire.
The Magyars, however, do not constitute quite half the population
of Hungary, and so. the Emperor would seem to be quite just in
refusing to let their language predominate in the army. The ma
jority of the people, who do not speak the Magyar tongue, belong
to half a dozen different races, and as it is almost positively neces
sary to select some one common language, the German seems the
logical one for official use. The Magyars, being the most numerous
of the many races, and able to combine and, act with more unity
and power, are practically the force most to be reckoned with in
Hungary. . 2^
This unity of the Magyars has so far only been used for the
purpose of making good bargains with Austrians in the interrela
tions of the kingdom and the empire; but the present protest
against receiving orders given in the German language seems to in
dicate very strongly that when the old Emperor dies and the unify
ing bond which has so much of its force in the fact thnt Francis
Joseph is personally respected and beloved is thus broken, Hungary
will set up an independent Government which will be practically a
Magyar nation. s ,t* ' .

THE SERPENT AND THE CITIZEN.
A Cunning Serpent once bit; a. Good
Citizen as the latter wandereii about
the Political Domain In quest Â«?f some
body or something for which he could
vote at the Next Election.
"You should not have done that,"
said the Good' Citizen, as ac gladly
drank large quantities of Red Liquor
in order to overcome the effects of the
bite, "for I was thinking of voting for
you." .\u25a0 v :;* . : .
"Have done what?" the Cunning Ser
pent inquired.
"Have bitten me.""
"You both shock and. grieve me," re
plied the. Cunning Serpent (who was
looking for. votes). i am sure that I
never bit you. I could not bring my
self to do such a thing."
"But I felt the bite," responded the
Good Citizen. * , : ; ;
"You have been led to thlnic so by
the gross libel of my enemies.'!;
jj "And I saw you bite me.",
"That Is another of the' unjustifiable
and iniquitous libels of my political

PRETTY NEW YORK GIRL
IN SPIRITED CONTEST FOR
SCHOOL COMMISSIONED
MISS BERTHA HERBERT.
WESTCHESTER COunTY has an Interesting political fight on its hands
and the prime mover in creating an active campaign' is a woman,
says the Wcstchester '. (N.;.Y.) correspondent of the Philadelphia In
quirer. Experienced politicians are looking on with Interest, and of
late those who have opposed her election have done more than look on for
their own amusement. Her efforts have caused them to get out and hustle as
they have not hustled for years, and even now the situation Is not as favor
able as they could wish.
Some time ago Miss Bertha Herbert, emulating, the example of Mrs. Cler
ence Mackayi announced her Intention of running for a School Commisslon
ership in W r estchester County. -A number of her friends good-naturedly took
sides with her and began a campaign against the party that holds sway In
the district. â¢ . - .
The leaders smiled at first and even seemed to encourage her efforts by
doing nothing to oppose her. Soon, however, the boom reached proportions
that were not expected, and there was Immediately a rush to defeat her In
convention. This was done and a man received the nomination.
This move did not In â¢ the least discourage Miss | Berbert,- as she immedi
ately announced her Intention of running on an; independent ticket, and she
is now in the field and in the midst of an exciting campaign. As to what the
-outcome will be, no one, of course, knows, but she feels confident of win-,
ning and said to-day:
"I'm In this fight for blood. I was defeated In the convention through
political moves with which I-was not familiar, but I have learned a thing
or two since then and I feel sure that I shall -win. Yes, you may say that
I feel sure I shall win," ' . . .
Miss : Berbert Is very pretty, and there are undoubtedly many young men
who will cast aside party prejudice in order to cast their ballots for her.

MAKING SURE OF. THE TIP:
"Bring the change. In quarters," said the
man who had paid for a If luncheon with
a $sblll.
"Why did you specify the denomina
tion?" asked the woman opposite. ",
"Because, if I v hadn't that fellow would
have brought jn half dollars arid then I'd
have had to give him a 50-cent tip. .That
is a trick most. waiters have. When it is
possible to bring the change in dollars
and half dollars they do It, so the tip
will be correspondingly large. Of course,
In restaurants where 25 cents Is. the usual
tip they are' not quite so greedy and' get
the change so cut up that It shall con
tain "at least one quarter. They _-. are
afraid that If that Is not handy. they. may
get turned -, down without anything, and
they don't want to take chances of losing
all the way round. In all restaurants
dtmes are avoided in making change when
ever possible. / Every waiter, considers his
services worth â¢; more, than that/and he
takes precautions to prevent a * patron
from disgracing himself by offering him
one. \u25a0' "
"Cashiers are all In on the game or

SOME PRACTICAL JOKES.
It was an amusing, if unkind, hoax that
was practiced a short time ago on the
learned members of an antiquarian so
ciety when a (3reek charm was submitted
for their deliberation. The charm, "which
was said' to have been taken from the
dead body of a Bedouin, In whose fam
ily^it had been an heirloom for. many a
century,; consisted of a scrap of skin on
which was written a mysterious legend.
The charm was.: circulated among the.
members for inspection until it came into
the hands of a , gentleman who amid
much amusement deciphered the hiero
glyphics as "Old^Bob Rldle.y, O," the re
frain of an old Scotch song.
One of the best of these jokes was prac
ticed with considerable success by an
eighteenth century wit, who professed to
have unearthed an ancient memorial slab
on which this epitaph appeared:
BENE. A. TH. TH. ISST.
ONERE. POS. ET.
11. CLAUD. COS. TER. TRIP. â¢
E. SELLERO. F. IMP.
IN. GT. ONAS, DO.
TH. HI. SC.
ON. SOR. T. J. A. N. E.
Tn vain did archaeologists and linguists
rack their brains to find asolutlon of this
cryptic Inscription, which its discoverer
"humbly dedicated to the. penetrating
geniuses of Oxford, Cambridge, Eton and
the learned Society of Antiquaries," and
It was only when it had driven the clev
erestmen In England almost out of^thelr
wits thai the following reading was" sug
gested by the hoaxer: "Beneath this stone
reposeth; Claud Coster/ tripe seller, of
Implngton, as doth his consort Jane."
Some years ago the following "Inscrip
tion," purporting to be found at the base
of a cathedral during Its reconstruction,
appeared Â£in the columns of a Dublin
newspaper, with a . request that some lof
their readers send them a translation of
It: ' - \u25a0 \u25a0 '\u25a0\u25a0 , *

Duty and Its
Definition
WALLACE RICE
O'NEof the things that stands be
â¢. tween the human > mind and
clear thinking; is the l^ek of defi
nitions for well-known and
very-day phrases. It is a real; gain,
for instance, ; to be able to connect the
word "definition' with the cognate
words, definite and denniteness, and
to recall the meaning U has in photog
raphy andy astronomy.' .
So, it being uniformly, conceded that
a man , must do his ; duty, v it 13 of im
portance to lino xv what duty, means, and
stands for in life. Just now lam asked >.
"Is it a man's duty to'make ; tha most j
of himself and rise In the world, even!
at the cost' of "contentment happi
ness?" '
It is evident that a man may do hia
full duty "without rising 1 in/ the world,
and' that,- he .certainly .owes himself
some, happiness, even as a duty. So the
question' is not an unmixed or an easy
one, and i t has some Qf the aspects . of
life itself by reason of its varied bear
ings and involutions.
It seems to me toÂ»be- plainly the duty
of every one to leave the world both
better and happier for his stay in It.
But if he 'has, by reason of his own un
happlness, still made it possible for
many to 'be happy, as in, the case of the
miser whose money went to provide
pure water for his native town after
years of: mean and miserable hoarding
on his part, la. it not better than merely
to have been happy one's self?- .
One oujjht/ so it would seem, to leave
his children farther jflong on the road
to the world's. best esteem than ha him
self proceeded. iÃut-^the question "and
its answers bristle with "buts" â the.
world esteems best a number of things
that are not in the least estimable' In
themselves, but only become so by the
wise use made of them â are not ends in
themselves, in other words, but merely
means *to ends. Among these ~ are.
money, social position, fame In the usu
al sense, fine raiment, rich and costly
food, friends among the world's not
ables and a host of things that do not in
the least make for the world's better
ment unless they are most wisely dis
criminated in to- that end.
If one will take the golden rule and
hold , It up as his one guide toward
"making the best and the most of him
self," he will probably. reach the high
est good. That most people do not think
so la proved more plainly by their own
conduct than by any words.
WONDERFUL CARTRIDGE.
Fairfleld Sturmann. who pitched a deer
camp near Rocky Pond this week, pre
paratory*: to the opening of the season,
shot a wild goose a few days ago under
peculiar circumstances, says the Chltten
den, Vt., correspondent of the New York
World. The feat was witnessed by a
townsman who was in camp with him,
and. he vouches. for the story
â¢"When Mr. Sturmann. who comes from
Boston, went Into camp he took a shot
gun with; him. as well as a rifle, thinking
that he might get some grouse shooting.
He had fairly good luck In this line, and
one morning, just as he started out, he
saw a flock pt wild "geese soaring about
over the pond. He watched them, and
when he saw them drop Into the water
close to a flock of black' ducks he was
sorry, because he had no heavy shot.
Burt Townaend, the townsman who was
camping with Sturmann, suggested that
he draw some old-fashioned Iron nails
out of 'the slabs'of the cabm tn which'
they were living and. load his shells with
them. This was better than nothing, and
the men loaded' up two shells; with nails
about three Inches long. As they stuck
out beyond the end of the paper cart
ridges dry grass was packed about them
In place of the usual wad.
Armed with one of these shells In each
barrel of the shotgun. Sturmann
and Townsend placed some boughs in a
boat and drifted down the pond toward
the ducks and geese. Tney lay In tha
bottom of the boat, so as not to attract
attention, and when they thought they
were in range peeked out.
They were almost up to the feeding
birds, and before Sturmann could fire
both flocks rose and mingled in a single
cloud of feathers. They were, perhaps,
forty feet above the water and three rods
off when Sturmann ahot both barrels si
multaneously and nearly upset the boat.
Instantly a duck and a goose dropped to
the pond. The duck was dead,, but the
goose was only wounded and made a des
perate effort to rise.
Townsend seized the oars and was mak
ing for the birds, when the goose got into
the, air, and with him went the dead duck.
He tried desperately to reach the rest of
the flock; but had reached a height of
twenty feet, when he settled slowly. la
another minute the men had him. As
they pulled, him honking into the boat to
wring his neck they were astonished to
discover that he was firmly nailed to the
duck. One of the nails had penetrated
the duck's neck and Imbedded itself In
the breast of the goose.
The men were still exclaiming when
they heard a squawking . directly over
head. ' an<*. glancing upward, saw a duck
aflame high in the air. He was coming
down head firsthand looked like a comet.
He struck ; the water close to the boat,
and when he arose was ' dead. Every
feather had been burned from him,' and it
is thought that the dry grass used for
wadding lodged under his wing, and set
him afire.:
not transgress the rules if .he attends In
a neat dark suit.

BECOMES REAL DRAMA
PRODUCTION' IS MARVELOUS
Simonides Suggests
Strength of an
Irving.
Messala Is Fiery and
Handsome as
Apollo.
The unexpected happened at the Grand j
Opera-housse last night^*'Ben Hur'\be-|
came drama. Cheerfully as one went to j
renew seÂ»iuÂ»inianee with its sumptuous'
spectacle, with the grtat race on the <
Anuot-h lngleEide, and the rest, one ex- I
pected only the panoramic excitement
from "Ben Hur." Good luck, extreme
cood luck in the Ben Hur, In a Simon-
Ivies who suggests even an Irving, in a
* handsome and tiery Mcssala,- and the
drama was there. There is also a Sheik
Uderirn who clinches the illusion, and a
capital Mailuch. Not to speak of the
horses and a leading camel, which are
all that can be alked-
Good it is that "Ben Hur" does not de
pend upon its women. They sell things
like the Esther at church bazaars, Mies
Rossmore is the Kremer adventuress in
Egypt's garb, and the mother of Hur
eimij'y cries for black alpaca. Again,
Daisy Robinson is genuinely !n the pic- I
ture as Tirrahâ i>Hy there is so little of \u25a0
her. and the Amrah of Stella Boniface
Weaver falls well into line. But the
*omen count for little, luckily, but un
luckiiy do not account for that little.
Age before beauty, Mr. Ethler, and Mr.
Robert MoWade's extraordinary Simon-
Wes comes first. The part, played wholly
Bitting down, offers oomi>aratlvely few
opportunities, but with them Mr. Me-
Vude enricnea the play with a po'trait
of intense, interest. One would like to
B&ft him as a Shylock, as King I-^ar, for
his Simonides is of the fiber that makes
theÂ«>. His facial drama is subtly and
powerfully interesting, from its admirable
gentleness as the Jew looks upon his
daughter, to the gamut of expression as
hÂ« regards the claimant Ben Hur. He
ha* an equally admirable elocution, has
this actor, clear, musical and roost ex
pressive. Extraordinary dignity, tender
ness, naturalness, characterize the whole
performance. Possibly one could take ex
ception to Mr. McWade's rather chalky
xnake-up, capitally drawn as it is, but one
be indeed captious to quarrel with
this portrait on any other ground.
fo Mr. Ethier, on the occasion of the first
f lolal 'production cf "Ben Hur" thÂ» MÂ«
cala of the cast, is this year the Ben
Hur. Mr. Ethier is almost too beautiful
to be true. Apnllo should be looking for
another place. Mr. Ethier In evidence. He
is the handsomest actor known to local
ken, and his face is not his only for
tune. From luck to heel you see his kind
fnore frequently at the Orpheumâ perhaps
Frank Worthing owns the legs most un
like Mr. Ethler'fsâ you remember them in
"The Eternal Feminine." But Mr. Ethier
can act, and his Bin Hur is a delightfully
virile and spirited affair. Actually the
galley scene becomes real as he faces the
tribune Arrius, becomes a den where
human cattle, chained to an oar, go
mad and die. A better Esther and the
little love-making would bÂ« as convincing,
tbe same with, the u-ae, who Is sufficient
ly sultry but painfully undistinguished.
But in picture and drama Mr. Ethier
wholly patislies.
Julius McVicker's Messala is also hap
pily key^d. Strong, passionate. Insolent,
he makes the figure of the Roman stand
out very vividly from the canvas. Henry
Weaver Is also a capital Sheik Ildertm.
and the rest of the male cast all effec-
Mabel Mortimer Is the Esther. By her
vnio*. a rareiy beautiful one, she should
be singing Carmen. 1 don"t know of
anything that Miss Mortimer could act.
She looks well, however.
As to the rest, the ballets are just as
beautiful, the chariot race Just as ex
citing, and the scenery just as orlental
7ly splendid as beforeâ with the drama

Every member of tho. company billed
SB "Fulton's Grafs Widows," which be
gan a week's engagement at the Cali- |
fornia last night, works hard to en
tertain with morÂ« or less success. The
aggregation of talent contributes two
sketches called "The Widow's Wedding
Night", and "The Sign of the Light,"
besides several vaudeville stunts, two.
of which are quod. These are Bush
and Gordon In a humorous tumbling:
ait, and Pinard and Walters, who play
well on several musical instruments.
The Jeading lvoman, Mile. Guichard, is
handsome and makes a stunning ftgrure
in her startling costumes. She Is full
of vivacity and her voice, though lack*
ing: !n quality, is pleasing to hear. Mac
Vuir is a sprightly soubrette, with hair
as black as the raven's wing, and her
conga are well rendered. In line with
the burlesques of thÂ« day there are
two HebreSr comedians in the show,
the cleverer of the two being Charles
Hurkhardt, who knows his business.
With his partner, Murray Simons, he
plays a game of pool that Is quite
funny, but much of the.ir work could
be cut out without Injury. The two
j:iiEi:ijr comedians on the bill belie
. their title in both particulars. There
k are several pretty girls In the rhorus,
fwho change their costumes no less
than seven times in the action of the
hurlrsque.s. Most of the songs are new,
which cannot he suid of. a majority of
the Jokes.
Majestic.
The' excellent company at the Ma
jestic opened the week in a pleasing
comedy entitled "The Lottery of Love,"
adapted from the French of "Bisson
and Mars" by Augustin Daly. After
the first act, by which period the com
edy gets well under way, the fun be
gins to pile up like a football- team
upon a goal kicker. Notwithstanding 1
itn Kr*>nch origin, the play Is rtean
and wholesome to laugh at. The cb.ar T
acter of Doubledot is well suited to
James Ncill's temperament in light

But the bubbling, roaring fun is fur
nished by Mina Crolius Gleason, the
"mother-in-law" of tbe play, and L. R.

laugh and you are always looking
while they are on the stage. That
sterling character actor Frank Mac-

though he has but little to do. Miss

charmingly. She is a valuable acquisi

Central.
The Montana melodrama, "Big-Hearted
Jim," proved a big success at the Cen
tral Theater last evening, and the spirited
story of life in the early days of the
mining excitement In tbe West was clev
erly told by the entire company. ThÂ«
love story is a very pretty one and there,
Is that dash and excitement throughout
the drama that makes the characters re
mind forcibly of those of the day? of
'43 in California- HerseheJ Mayall was
a manly Sheriff and was given an ova
tion by the large audience at the olosÂ«
of each act. Edna Ellsmere Improves
her acting each week, and In her por
tras'al of the heroine last evening was
very effective. Henry Shumer again pre
sents ah artistic study in artistic vil
lainy, and little O]lie Cooper showed her
dramatic inherited, taJents In the cad role
of a persecuted Indian child- George P.
Webster gave a striking, portrayal of a
half-breed Indian, and James Corrigan
and Lillian Elliott kept the house in <on
stant laughter with the comedy lines,
George NJcholls, True Boardman, Charles
Edler and Myrtle Selwyn added to the
success of the play by clever acting. The
scenery waa massive and in the usual
realistic style, and the entire production
compared with any ever given at the
house.
The Chutfi".
liothwell Browne's Gaiety Girls, sev
en pre.tty misses, assisted by E. FranÂ«
cis Young, presented a one-act musical
sketch, "In a Green Room," abounding
in singing- and dancing, at the Chutea
yesterday, scoring a great hit at both
performances. Delphlno and Dolmora,
European novelty musical artists, had
a novel specialty and the wonderful
Busch family of acrobats gave an as
tonishing performance. Bert White
proved a clever and original monologist
and Frye and Bland, a limber-limbed
colored couple, occasioned huge quanti
ties of mirth. Stereoptlcon reproduc
tions of some of the local candidates
wer* received with various degrees of
partisan enthusiasm, and Marie Straub,
the pleasing soprano singer of illus
trated . songs, and the animatoscope,
showing many unique and Interesting
moving pictures, completed an excellent
programme. The New Century Wheelmen
will have an outing at the Chutes to
morrow, evening, the amateurs promise
a lot of surprises on Thursday night
and. there will be a <Â»ake-waik at the
Chutes on Saturday evening after the
regular performance. ,
AlciÂ»Bfir.
Pinero's "Iris" is the Alcazar's offer
ing this wee,k, and It proved highly
satisfactory to the, large audience that
was present last night- The piece is
staged In splendid shape and the
ple behind the footlights make the
most of the powerful play.
J^ucia Moore, in the title part, never
before appeared to greater advantage.
The audience was with her from start
to finish. Through all the maze "of the
rharacter's unfortunate wanderings,
Hiss Moore's hearers lived in and
breathed the same atmosphere. Charles
Waldron as Maldonado was. as usual
with him. a complete success. .- savo
when he compensated for the destruc
tion of chinaware by patently preserv
ing a table hi his paroxysms of rage.
Ernest Glendenning handled the role
of Trenwith with much credit. Adele
Belgarde. the charming, was Fanpy
gylvain to perfection. She Is one of
the most popular of the Alcazar people
and deservedly. John Mahcr surpassed
himself as Crokcr Harrington. Tha
numerous others of -the ca?t ably sus
tained the leaders.

PROPOSITION PREPARED

by Baron yon \u25a0 Sternburg
BERLIN. Oct. 30.â Baron. Speck yon
Sternburg, the German Emb^ssador .to
the United States, who sailed , for ' New
York on October 25 from Bremen on the
North German-Lloyd steamship Kaiser
Wilhelm 11, will on his arrival; at Wash
ington this week submit to I \\ President
Roosevelt the proposals of the German
Government for a new trade; agreement
between the United States and! Germany.
The Embassador takes with \ him full
knowledge of the German Government's
position and is prepared to negotiate.
The correspondent asked the Foreign
Office if, in view' of the public' interest in
the' United States in this subject, the Im
perial Chancellor would not define Ger
many's attitude with some : precision.
Prince, yon Bulqw received the correspon
dent to-day and among other things said:
An Idea I suspect is \abrcad in America that
the changes in tjie German tariffs and the
modification agreements with other European
countries were in some way directed â¢ against
the United States and that Germany desired
to damage the trade of the United States.
This, 1 am glad to bay, was never a motive
with the Gtrnian Government and the pro
posals that are about to be made are designed
to increase the exchanges betwe-m the two
countries and not to contract theta. The fa,
ciliies for transportation between Gecmany and
the United States are by the operation of force*
beyond the- control of either of tlwm bringing
the two people? into greater identity of econo
mic interests. Each country haa special apti
tudes and products of which the other onay
avail itself and yet maintain the revenue and
protective system adjusted to its ! Individual
situation. ..
Germany *S as \\tt\s inclined to shapfl - its
commercial policy according to rigid dogma
as the' United States. We desire.) to promote
the interests of our country and act In consid
eration of its economic needs. The old tariff
of ISTft. with the amendments toided tQ it
in the course of time, no longer corresponds,
In view of the development: of ; Germany's
economic life, with other interests.' Germany's
agriculture in particular suffered ;tn conse
quence of the treaties of the nineties whose
chief purpose was to win foreign markets. . For
this reason special attention ! war given . by
Oermany to agriculture In the new tariffs.
That this aim is. not hostile to the, commercial
treaties and can be reconciled with the spirit
of consideration for the interests of other coun
tries we have already proved by' the negotia
tion of a series ot new commercial conventions.
\\'ith the United States, too, wj can live
upon a friendly footing In trade relations
and extend our system of excharges to the
advantage of both countries.
Of courswÂ», we wish in our new : agreement
with the United States to maintain the same
points of vjew qs those that centroUed us
In recasting our general commercial relation
ship and in the new treaties -already nego
tiated.
We have accordingly drawn our proposals
after a careful examination of tie German
Interests affected. Our propositions will, I
ttjlnk, be quit" within practical Interests and.
w-e shall approach tha American Government
with no request that would Injury the vital
features of the American economic* organism.
AYe hope, with the co-operation that.' the
American Government has always emphasized
that a just reciprocity will bÂ« the basis -o?
all commercial agreements Â»nd we trill be able
to reach an arrangement patiÂ«factcry to botl>
nations.
The most expeditious rneann for furthering
the work would b* that ten men on both
cM g 8 having special acquaintance with qua
toms and tariff matters should meet for . an

friendly explanations.

STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Oct. 30. â
The football fans or the Stanford Uni

noon in their attempt to witness the
practice of the varsity squad. James

that for this week and .probably a

done behind locked gates. This means
the final and real work of the season

Crutade Asralnst Clear Bands.
He was mild-mannered, but there was
an air of determination about him
nevertheless, and he moved slowly
along the front of the cigar stand,
from the "Iberias," marked 50 ' cents
each, in the rear right-hand corner of
the case, to the "Hlspano Maduros," at
two for five, in the front row on the '
left.
"I am looking for a cigar without a
band accompaniment," he said, as the
salesman leaned toward him; "a kind
of quiet, undecorated cigar. You had
a brand that I fancied, but there are
bands on them now, and most any
"thir.s'H do me s=o long as its plain.
\u25a0 "Yes,. l know all about the craze for
cigar bands. Women want them to
paste on finger bowls and glass -water
pitchers, but why on earth don't you
do them up in bundles and let them
have them at so much a hundred or a
thousand? I don't want to peck away
at a band with my finder nails or fish
out a knlfe^and .open It and perform
a surgical operation â¢ every time I
smoke, and unless I'm careful I cut or
t*-ar the wrapper . so* that the cigar
won't draw. I'll buy any, sort of cigar
that has no band; I don't care how good
it Js or how bad it is, and when others
begi.i to follow my example', there'll be
one fool fad the less in the world.
"A g-flt and gyld band adds nothing
to the value of a, cigar, and the cheaper
the tobacco the. bigger and brighter the
label â¢ that's parted on â¢ It. The cigar
bands a nuisance, and I've started a
crusade against it." â Providence Jour

â¢.our here. -had. all the cream of tne New i

a half furlongs. This year 155 nomi

than a season ago. Such results are
encouraging to the association, and are
indicative of some superior sport to be
witnessed during the winter.

among other horses, of the crack three

BANKÂ§ GAIN DEPOSITS
V FROM FEAR OF SNAKES
Copperhead Bites Farmer While Tak
ing: Money From Barnyard
;{; { {V K Kline Place.
The farmers of the cotton belt for !
some reason - have long been shy of
I banks and have been in the habit of
j putting their money in receptacles nf
various kinds, such as old shoes and
cans.
Charles Bosier. a farmer living near
Flatonia, Tex., went to a corner of his
yard one day and in a few minutes
came hurrying back,- shouting to his
! wife that he had been bitten by ,a cop
j perhead snake. Bosier came near dy
ing from the effects of the snake' 3
poison and it was not until two days
cf ter the snake bit him that Bosier
was able to tell how It happened. He
had gone to get 150 he had on deposit
( in an old shoe under a board in the
corner of the yard, and as he reached
in to get the shoe â¢ the snake struck
him.
Upon hearing the story Mrs. Bosier
went out to get the money where her,
husband had left It. The shoe was
I still under the board and the farmer's
wife reached in to get it, when she
t caught a glimpse of a copperhead
snake lying there. She was not quick
enough to jerk her hand back before
the snake struck her. It sank its
fangs in her thumb so deep that she
dragged the copperhead along from un
der the board when she pulled her
hand out. She shook it loose and ran
screaming to the house.
As soon as he had attended to his
wife's snake, bite Farmer Bosier got
his gun, went out to the place whÂ«sro
the snake seemed to be standing guard
and lifted the board. Coiled on the
old shoe was the copperhead, and it
showed fight at once. Bosier Jumped
aside and shot the serpent's head oft.
The $50 was all right In the shoe and
Farmer Bosier removed it to the house.
j The news of this adventure of \. the
Bosier family with the copperhead
snake soon spread about the neighbor
hood, and then the farmers began com
ing into Flatonia every day to, deposit
in the banks all sorts and conditions
.of money. The cashier of the First
s National Bank of Flatonia sjiys that
- for af week the deposits in that bank
1 were double what they had been in
I any previous week In its history. :
i Chicago Chronicle.
She Came Early.
A great many curious stories are told
of the ehopplng propensities"' of ' ladles,
and a London salesman in a' carpet ware
house has just added a good one to the
number.
One day a well-dressed lady called and
asked to look at some carpets.
With the usual politeness in such cases
the goods were shown, every shade and
pattern in the shop being spread out for
examination.
After looking at everything about the
place and driving some very close bar
gains in the matter of price, the lady < se
lected a carpet for each room in {her
house, running up a bill filled' the
courteous salesman's heart with Joy.,
Some hours, had been spent In making
out . the important order, and ' when all
was i completed the clerk asked \u25a0* whither
the carpets were to "be sent. .; :" : - :
The lady replied without hesitation that
she would call and let hlnvknow.: : . i
"You see," she added," "my husband has
Just bought a piece . of ground and talks
of soon building a* house on it. If j: he
does, you know,' I shall want some* new
carpets, and then I will" call' and get
these/ '. \u25a0
The polite clerk thanked, the lady very
kindly, and she went away very .well con
tent'with her "purchases."â Tlt-Blts.

Special Dispatch to Tho Call.
NEW YORK, Oct. 30.â Suspecting I that

the, Jamaica race track quietly bided their
time todaj': until the horse was
brought into the paddock to run In the
last race, which was for j-maidens,j -maidens, / in
which "ringers" are usually started. \ The
officials then informed the; negro; trainer
in chargeof Cataract that they , would
not permit the animal to runj giving as a,
reason that he was not registered, as re
quired, with the registrar of the Jockey.
Club, although in the stud jbopk there is
registered such a, name as Cataract with
same pedigree as : that given on . to-day's
programmeâ by Niagara out of Charlotte.
! The horse was entered in 5 the nanie of
M. Mitchell, well known on the turf.
Mitchell said he was managing him for a
banker in Virginia. .
Under instructions from Robert Pinker
ton | the horse was taken in charge by
several of his men, placed in Stable 14,
to be washed and inspected' for. evidences
of jdye, for some horsemen "thought they
saw bungling, attempts to | discolor or

marks the forehead. In other. respects he

the name of J. A. Wernberg, who with
his trainer,. J. J. McCafferty, could readily
identify the alleged ringer, of to-day if as
declared, it were really. Fr.eckman. These
two horsemen will. Inspect- the . animal
which was -entered on to-day's card as a

MODERN METHODS OF
LIGHTING MUSEUMS
View of Fine Arts Near Boston Will
Have Latent Result* of
Science.
A series of experiments is now going on
preparatory to removal of the collections
to a new building for which land has al
ready been bought in the Fenway, a part
of the comprehensive park system of the'
city , of Boston. ' On this" site the Museum
of Fine Arts will take : its place as part
of a group of notable educational institu
tions, including ,â¢ the medical school \u25a0 of
Harvard University, Simmons : College for
Women, the â¢ New ; England Conservatory
of Music, the Girls' Latin School and the
famous Isabella Stuart Gardner Museum
In the Fenway. The new building will
embody unique features based' upon
studies made by the consulting architects,
Messrs. ;R,': Clipston, Sturgis and Edmund
C. Wheelwright, and of the directors of
the'museum, among European and Amer
ican Institutions. A;short, time ago a
commission consisting of these gentlemen
gaveseveral monthÃ to visiting the prom
inent museums in nearly every country of
Europe. The directors are also carrying
"on ; in a strange-looking building on the
outskirts of the ; city a series of photo-,
metric â¢ measurements, '. subjecting paint
ings, "statuary and {other objects to vari
ous settings and methods of lighting. This
work, which is necessarily of : -. an exact
scientific character, was started by Pro
fessor Charles ,L. Norton of the Massa
chusetts Institute of Technology and con
tinued by W. R.McCormack of the same
institution. These experiments at this
writing have not been completed, and no
body , can :â¢ say how far the conclusions
reached ; in them will lead the ; architects
of the new museum to adopt unusual con
structive features.' \lt Is certain, however,
that no art-museum in the history of the
world will . have been so studiously plan
ned.âWorld To-Day. * :

OUR WAY OF SPELLING
. . IS AN AWFUL MESS
Still Room for Many Reforms and Cut
tine Out I U lie less J2
Letters.
Between the two great American dic
tionary makers, Webster and Worcester,
the race has gone altogether in favor of
Webster, and the methods of spelling rec
ommended in . the dictionary that has
grown out of hisâ it no longer bears his
name as it usedâ are generally accepted in
the United States, and partially accepted
in Scotland and Canada. ;
, It Is supposed iby many that Webster
was a spelling reformer, chiefly because
he left the "v" out of a number of words
that used to end in "our" before,he spell
ed i them otherwise.
There, are, however, only thirty Â»-sfx of
those words, and . they do not make
enough real difference in the hundreds
of thousands that make up the language
to cause ; all the heated discussions that
have gone on . about themâ and are still
going on.
It being the object of a spelling reform
er to cut out all needless letters, all
that are not required for pronouncing any
given word properly, some of Webster's
innovations, now generally accepted In
this ; country, are open to objection.
Words that used to end in "re," for in
stance,. he spells with "er," unless there
is a "cV in front. .This disturbed an an
alogy,' ' for . one \ thing; since we write
"massacre" and "acre," but ""saber,"
"center," "fiber," etc.
\u25a0 When it comes to the use of such words
as verbs, however, the older spelling has
the best of It, for the older men -wrote
"sabred," "centred." "fibred," where the
newer ones spell "sabered," : "centered,"
"fibered," and so of "centring" and "cen
tering." . ! . \u25a0 .
In words ending with '%" or formed
from words so ending, there Is a curious
lack of "consistency in both of them.
; Webster\ writes "councilor" and "coun
selor,',' but "chancellor"â which is wholly
inconsistent. But : spell 3 - the
words ' "dulness,";Vdistll," "enrolment,"
"fulfil,", .{"fulness," "Instalment," and
many ; more, with one .."1," where Webster
uses itwo. Both spell the words "ful
filled"; and "distilled," however, and "ful
filling"' and "distilling." In "skilful" and
"wilful," too, : .Worcester . saves ; the need
less letter. But in words ending with "1"
when |thÂ© ; last \u25a0 syllable is unaccented,
..Webster saves a letter; as in Vimperiled,"
."modeled,"* and the like, - which /Worces
ter spells with two *Ts."
{Worcester and Webster both spell "com
plexion," { but "connection," "reflection,"
and . "Inflection." -The ; British save a let
ter by-using ''connexion," "reflexion," and
"inflexion" . also, .with a gain in consist
ency.' I Americans spell the phrase as one
1 wordUn ''forever," with great loss to Its
significance; 'the English always spell it
,'for "ever." -But? isn't it all a pretty
mess?â Chicago Journal. -.

MOROS HAVE CURIOUS
WAY OF MAKING FIUE
Bamboo Stick, a Small Piece of China
r and Some Tinder Compose
. Apparatus.
â¢ The . match has been said, to be the
greatest clvilizer of the world, but It has
not vet completed its work. There are
still tribes .of barbarous and semi-bar
barous people who use nature's means for
producing fire, either by friction with
or without apparatus, or the contact of
two substances which produce a spark, as
flint and steel.
The Moros use a. method distinctive
from other savage races and of Interest
not only for Its uniqueness but as show
ing the effect of environment on inven
tion.
This apparatus consists of a bamboo
stick, ,a bit of china and tinder. Cylin
drical cases are also part of the device,
one being a case for tobacco and the
other a case for the china and tinder.
The whole, connected with cords, is worn
at the belt. - .; ...'.'. ; ;
To use the apparatus the native takes
tho bamboo firmly in his left hand and
In his right holds the bit of china by
the finger and thumb, and on the thumb
side pinches a bit of tinder. The edge
of the china Is then struck sharply down
and along the bamboo, producing a
bright and long spark, which catches in
the tinder and Ignites it. Very little
practice is required to enable a novice to
light a fir - by this . means. Obviously,
when the apparatus was first devised, no
china was available and doubtless some
sharp stone took its place- Now, how
ever, bits of broken china such .aa arÂ«
found in cheap eating-houses, are regard
ed as best for the purpose and universally
used. '
The thoughtful reader will at once draw
an analogy > between this means of flre
making and the flint and steel of his own
ancestors. In the Eastern tropics, how
ever," bamboo is the commonest of woods,
and so was doubtless observed many
times to make a bright spark when struck
where flint, in contact with metal, was
seentonce. In crnequence after thÂ© first
bright ' thinker had devised this way of
using the spark the method held Its pop
ularity and obtains to this day, although
the flint and steel Is so much simpler,
caster and more portable.
The philosophy of the device will at
once be apparent. The sharp edge of the
china scrapes off' a bit of bambooâ not
much, because the wood Is hard and thÂ»
outside has quite a glazeâ but enough to
make incandescent by the friction of the
stroke. The tinder catches this spark
and the desired flame Is the result.âChi

it is not the fault of some of their counr
tryrnen now living at this port. Every

appears at the Folsom street boat land
â¢ Ing a little party yjf Russians is on hand
vith a male and a female orator. As
soon as the officers - i launch has
brought ashore take thpir departure the
oratory begins. The local daily papers
\u25a0*Sth the latest news from Russia are
translated to the sailors, and with the ca
ble dispatches as texts tiie speakers turn
loese a flood of Russian, to which the
Czar's tars-lisien with grave interest.
Just what sort of advice is being poured
into the bluejackets' ears is not known.
The Lena's sailors speak no English and
the local agitators preserve their own
counsel. It is presumed, however, that
the oratory does not take any form of
T.hich the Czar would approve, for it
never begins until the Lena's officer? are

The Lena is under order? to reach Vladi

cient Order of United Workmen was the

ficiary association in the United Statesf
which since its organization has dis
tributed the sum of 5150,000,000 for the nro
tection of the homes of it 8 members
From a humble beginning, he said the
order had. spread its, influence in ali di
rections, until other associations follow
ing along: the same lines, have acquired
an .aggregate membership of nearly
8,000,000. people in this .country and are
disbursing ! $1,000,000 a week for the pro
tection of : home, widows, ' orphans and
dependent ones. He added that at least
five persons are interested directly or in
directly in each individual member of a â¢
fraternal beneficiary society, ' so that
â¢nearly ; 35.000,000-. people are' affected by
fraternalism. y
Tate.spoke for nearly an hour and held
his vast audience all the time ''He' was
applauded again and again and was
forced .twice to arise and bow .'acknowl

ARMY OFFICER
IS A DESERTER
Lieutenant Frank I. Otis
â¢ Duplicates His Pay War
rants and Then Disappears
HIS WIFE IS IN NEED
Family of Man Who Said His
Salary Was Inadequate Is
in a Destitute Condition
Lieutenant Frank I. Otis, U. 8. A., who
created some stir here about three
months ago by advertising for a civilian
position because, he could not support his
family upon his salary as an army officer,
is missing. His friends fear that his
mind "has become deranged. Otis left
Washington, D. C, about a\ month ago
for this city and has not been heard of
since.
Besides his family troubles it develops
that Otis is involved in some serious fin
ancial tangles. General . Kunston has re
ported that Otis has duplicated his pay
account for August. The chief paymaster
of the Department of California reports
an unpaid voucher for -. September, and
the chief paymaster of the East reports
another. If he is located it is certain
that Otis will be arrested on a charge of
misappropriating Government funds. ;Â».
The missing officer was last heard of'
in New York, where he was visiting a.
brother. He was granted a Bick leave on
August 1. On September 4 he went to
Fort Jayny, sick, and shortly afterward
disappeared. It was learned later that
he was seen 'in N'pw York.
The missing officer's wife and family
are in Santa Rasa in a destitute condi
tion. Since Otis left one of his five chil;
dren has died. It was through a telegram
to the War Department from the wife,
asking for aid, that the vagaries of Otis,
came to light. She wired that one of
Otis' children had died and that she was
destitute.
. Lieutenant Otis advertised for a civilian
position in July. Twins were born to his
wife- on the 4th ' of that month â¢ and he
claimed that his salary as an army offi
cer was Inadequate to support his family,
five children In all. He was the object of
much sympathy at the time and President
Roosevelt sent him a personal letter of
encouragement.
Otis had been ordered to the Philip
pines, which would have taken him away
from his family. This order was canceled
through the good offices of the President,
and Otis was given a month's leave to
i pull himself together.
1 The reports- of General Funston and the ;
two paymasters indicate that Oti3 did not
use the time well. Army officers who
know Otis and his troubles decline abso
lutely to discuss the subjectt Otis was
in the Fourth Cavalry.

PLAIN ADVICE
TO THE CLERCY
Professor Els ton ,. Declares
;AMj Oratory/ in .Pulpit
[ Is' Essential These Days
PEW NO LONGEK SILENT
Pastor Cannot Mispronounce
English Language and
Break Grammatical Eules
At*a meeting of the Association of Min
ister? of Christian Churches of San Fran
cisco yesterday in the Young Men's Chris
tian Association auditorium Professor A.
MI Klston of the Berkeley Bible Seminary
gave advice online art of public speaking.
The Rev. Frank Stuart Ford presided.
Prior to the address the ministers of the
various denominations gave their reports,
which in every instance showed that there
is a great progress in spiritual labor, with
corresponding results. ; .
In the course of the reports the only
touch of. a political color was depicted by
the Rev. A. A. Burlelgh, pastor of Bethel
African Metiiodist Episcopal Church,
Powell street, arid Mr. Ford, pastor of
the First Christian Church. Twelfth
street, between Mission and Howard.
Mr. ;Burleigh told his hearers that his
congregation is lining up in politics to
vote a straight ticket for "good govern
ment," and that, not satisfied with that
alone, it is working to induce others to do
the same. - . /
Mr. Ford said some people in his vicin
ity are preparing to vote "a straight in
decent ticket."
Professor Elston's address, entitled
"Value ot the Study of Public Speaking
to the Ministers," was in>part as follows:
The conditions of modern life have- modified
to a great extent the art of oratory. To-day
we exalt the theme and ignore the delivery: Â«â¢
emphasize the matter and minimize the man
ner In public speaking.
The' greatest opportunity of the modern ora
tor, the pulpit, is neglected.
Many regard oratory as nn educational lux
ury, an embellishment of no great value in
the pulpit. The ldta prevails that a strict re
gard to the principles of oratory would be
deemed to be theatrical.
As a means of. mental culture, no study
equals" oratory in the number of faculties it
calls into play and in the complexity ot their
action.
The gospel poorly preacned will not do the
good the educated, j eloquent and consecrated
man who understands his work can accom
plish.
The simplest sermon well delivered will move
people: the grandest sermon presented in a dis
agreeable way will annoy.
The time has come when the pew no longer
keeps silent, but it demands more and more
from the minister.
He can no longer mispronounce the English
: language and break grammatical rules and
elocutionary principles without being criticized.
As the pew tweomes better educated It will
demand a better educatea pulpit â educated In
manner as well as matter.
1 would not defend theatricals or affecta
tion or extravagant and foolish, spectacular,
sensationalism in the pulpit, but rather a sin
cere, earnest, clear, forcible, accurate delivery.
\u25a0 A tired tone and monotonous , style stand in
the way of success.
To be practical, every preacher la anxious,
more or less, about his salary/ the 'bread and
butter, the loaves and fishes. And he should
be.
Paul eaid: "The Lord hath ordained that
they who preach the gospel should live of the
gospel."
SÂ£y what you please, but it is tha educated,
the eloquent minister that draws the congre
gation and commands the highest salary. And
It should be so. v f
It was announced that the evangelistic
weekly prayer meeting will be held to
morrow afternoon from 1:30 to 2:30 o'clock
at the West Side Christian Church, Bush
street, near Devlsadero.
SAYS AVIKK'S ACTIONS
COST HIM A BONANZA
Wilford Dennis AÂ»kÂ» for a Divorce, AÂ«
aertlnK that Ills Spoutte
*J~- i'v^ : - . :' Naggfed Hint.
Asserting that his wife' 3 nagging
finally drove him to abandon what he
believes would have proved to be a
bonanza. WJlford Dennis filed suit yes
terday for divorce from'Alatllda Dennis.
Dennis says that he was working on
a valuable mine seven miles from Sut- j
ter Creek, but his wife refused to go
and ll\e on the property, compelling
him to go to the mine each day and j
return in the evening, no matter how
inclement the weather. Finally, he
says, he became so discouraged that he
abandoned the mine and secured a po
sition in Jackson, Amador County, but
she also refused to live there, making
his life so miserable with her com
'p.aints that he now wants frctedom.
Decrees of divorce were granted yes
terday to .Clara from James Crichton
for cruelty, Mary E. from Albert E.
Barth for cruelty and Annie R. from
George W. Randolph for desertion.
Suits for divorce were filed by Ella
M. against Charles McPherson for cru
elty, Grace M against James J. Me-
Keever for cruelty and Thoma3 I>.
against Lydia Tunstead for>.desertion.
In answer to the complaint for dl-^
vorce filed' against him by his wife,"
Ethel Louise, James H. Babcock, known
as "Bab." denies all of the charges of
his wife that he has been wasting his
money "on fine horses and carriages, de
nies th: . he has been intimate with
other, women, and says that his wife's
present aversion to him is due to the
influence of a Mrs. Potter. He Jinks
that her prayer for divorce be denied. :

lAiter Learning: Mistake
FEINTING- BILL HELD
Member of Firm Which Lost
Its Suit Fails to Appear
;to Support His Claim
:The Finance Committee of the Board
of Supervisors yesterday formally de
cided to rescind the previous action in
cutting down the pay, of teamsters em
ployed by the Board of Works from $6
to $5 40 per day for double teams and
from $5 to $4 50 for single teams. The cut
was made under a mistaken idea that an
agreement for the reduction had been en
tered into last June. Supervisor Connor,
chairman of the Street Committee, In
formed his colleagues that such was not
the case. ..
The Finance ' Committee) postponed ac
tion on the bill of Phillips & Van Orden
for $486 50 for printing 2000 copies of the
election laws, owing to the non-appear
ance of a. member of the firm. Judge
Seawell. has decided that the Supervisors
have* the power to investigate 'such bills
before signing: them, the firm having
brought suit to compel payment of the
bill without _ the approval of the Super
visors.
The City Engineer Informed theiFinance
"Committee that It would cost $750 to es
tablish grades on San Bruno avenue from
Dwight street to the intersection of Rail
road avenue. The Visitacion Valley Im
provement Club petitioned for .the im
provement because the United Railroads
has agreed to furnish better street car
service. A committee from the club wait
ed on the Finance Committee to urge that
the $750 be allowed for th-e purpose, but
it was explained that there are no funds
available. It was decided, however, to
take the matter up with the United Rail
roads next Monday morning, when inter
ested property owners will be present to
explain their desires.
The petitions of the "Works Board that
It be authorized to enter into a contract
for the filling in of Tork street from
Twenty-sixth to Army at a cost of $3000
in order to eradicate the Precita Valley
swamp, and that sidewalk widths on
Onondaga and Ocean avenues be reduced
were referred to committees.
SAYS* STREET IS FILTHY.
F. L. Hansen appeared before the Fin
ance Committee to urge that cesspools be
built in the sewer in Franklin street from
Green to Lombard, the work bavins been
overlooked when the sewer was built
some years ago. The committee cited A.
Burr, a property owner on the block, to
show cause why he should not bear parr
of - the expense, he having expressed his
refusal to do so. Hansen said the street
was in a very filthy condition.
The. Finance Committee postponed ac
tion'for two weeks on the request of the
Board of Works for authority to build, a
bulkhead at Fourth and Channel streets
at an estimated cost to the city of $3500.
The petition of Bomers & Co. for a per
mit to build a spur track on Sixth and
Hubbell streets was referred to the Street
Committee. SSS
The amended ordinance imposing a
graduated license of from J3 to $100 per
quarter lon keepers of hotels, boarding
houses, restaurants or places of refresh
ment, according to the receipts." was
passed to print by the board.
BILLS FINALLY PASSED.

bitumen pavements at a cost of $2500.

NEW YORK, Oct. 30. â The tendency; to re
duce crop estimates stimulated the market in
the face of threaten)*! revolution in Russia.
The maximum advance here extended to 15
or 20 points in. the more active options. Most
of the buying was, however, of a professional
character and was chiefly covering of shorts.
The largest spot dealers were good sellers, on
the rise and there was considerable profit
taking by Southern operators and loct-.l com
mission houses. The demand, however, was
ample to pustain most of the advance. vlf the
crop proves no larger than 10,500.iXK) bales we
shall undoubtedly see ultimately higher prices.
A. G. Huston, a Liverpool statistician, who
has been in the South for the last thirty days,
makes an estimate of- this year's crop at 10,
250,000 bales. This, no doubt, Is a very bull
ish report.

CHICAGO, Oct. ..-â¢ 30. â The wheat â¢ market
opened weak on heavy prost taking an! liberal
'short welling "by commission houses. ;, May was
oft 9Â»c to *4c at Die to 61 9Â»o. "December was
down Vtc to *i'c at 89& c , to 89*4 c. jjAt f- tho
start the market was influenced by aj decline
of lc to lV4c In the pries of wheat at Hven
pool. Another factor . . that '- had some effe/t
was wet weather In '. the American Southwest,
where rains were greatly needed' to gtsrm lab te
the fall sown crops. - Shorts . took '_\u25a0 advantage
of the Initial weakness and' covered r f/eoljr,
forcing the price of May. up to 01*40 anfl De*
cember to 9Oi4c. Further profit taking casuljgd
in another reaction, but ; prices held, aboV^the
loweet point [ touched-, on 1 opening I transactions.
It was goon Â«vldent : that several bull I leaders
were supporting the market and picking up all
offerings. This eventually started renewed cov
ering by - short* â¢ and ~ resulted -in a complete

There was more Butter on the market yes
terdavthan for several, weeks and the' market
was perceptibly weaker in roneequence. There
was increased pressure to sell on the exchange,
and as buyers "held off the quotation* were
again a fraction lower. Chee? e and Egrgs wera
unchanged as far sm" quotations were concerned. .
Lut Eoma of th* -trarte reported less firmness in
fancy ranch . Eggs. The quotations for firsts,
however, were adx-anced vu. the Exchange, as
wjll be seen.
The present prices. of Call rornla Butter admit
of a profitable market .for Eastern Butter, and ;
as there are large quanties of it here, and as
khfe quality If unusually >mÂ« this year, the re
tailers are taking it in large lines. ,This, of
course, . helps to weaken the Butter market.

COLLINS USES
FIGHT WORDS
Angry Interchange in Court
Between Him and Opposing
Counsel, Hiram Johnson
EEPKIMAXDED BY JUDCiE
Defendant's Motion to Have
Perjury Case Transferred
Is Denied by Judge Lennon
Tbc prosecution haÂ» scored the first
point In the technical fight being made by
Attorney' George I>. Collins to prevent
Judge Lennon of Marin County from pre
Â«ldJr.p at hlB trlaJ on the charge of per-
The motion of the defendant to
transfer the case to another department
ot the Superior Court of this county was
6ecitd yesterday afternoon by Judge
Lenroc, and Collins announced that he
would at one* apply to the Supreme Court
tor a writ of prohibition. The case will
be -again called to-morrow morning for
the defendant to enter his plea, when a
notion to Quash the Indictment will be
made.
Oolllns' attitude during the arguments
wa* defiant and the Judge had to repri
â mand him for his remarks regarding At
torney Hiram Johnson when he com
menced to reply to Johnson's argument.
Kone cf his associate counsel eat beside
him aa on former occasions.
When the case wu called yesterday
morning Collin* resumed his argument on
the motion to transfer the case. He first
offered In evidence an affidavit by At
torney Jacob 8. Meyer to the 'effect that
feleyer had never requested or suggested
to Judge L&wlor that the Judge should
assign the bigamy case against Collins to
bis own court or to any court. He re
ferred to the statement In Judge Lawior's
affidavit that the Judge had been active
Â«uid diligent In the extradition proceed
ings, which he argued showed that the
Judge had formed an opinion adverse to
the accused. That of itself, he argued,
Alsqualifled the Judge from doing any
act In regard to the case, such as the ap
e pelntment of an outside Judge to sit on the
case, and euch an appointment was a vio
lation of. the law. He also argued that
the warrants of attachment in the bigamy
case .were unlawfully Issued and no bail
vu fixed, which showed bias and' preju
dice on Lawior's part. In conclusion, he
eaid he did .not desire to reflect- in any
way upon the personal character of either
Judge Lawlor or Judge Lennon, 'but mere
ly on their Judicial acta. . ;
> ,Â« ; . SAYS THERE IS.WO BIAS. l~ \u25a0
District". Attorney Bylngton said he had
, no- desire to deprive the defendant of any
*of o his legal rights, but he argued there .
\u25a0 was nothing in the affidavits submitted
by trie defendant to show bias and preju
*4lÂ£e oriÂ°the part of Judge Lawlor and
there c was absphitely =nb "attack* of any
kind made upon Judge Lennon. He con
tended that Judge Lawlor was justified, in
calling upon an .outside Judge to sit in
thte * . â¢ : â¢â¢.
Attorney Hiram Johnson declare* that
all of the averments fn the defendant's
affidavit were untrue. Judge .Lawldr,' he '
raid., had simply done 'his duty as a citl
sen and a Judge. He pointed out that
when Lawlor assigned Judge Lennon K>Â°
o preside c at the trial of the bigamy case
the defendant 6ffered 'no* objection, and:
for two weeks argued nrotions before that
Judge till he fled Â£romÂ° the Jurisdiction of
the court." Â°Â° z .
Collins raised a storm when He." rose to
reiply. He began: "In the presentation or
questions of lawÂ°or of f act, â¢ forensic ar-.
gument ts better adapted to a clear eluci
dation than jfn imitation stump speech or
an effort at declamation." " ; _; â¢
Johnson Jumped to his feet" and said:
*'I have treated the defendant with cour
tejy, but If he wants to resort to these
tactics I yill meet him *t any time he
; may fix."
"Yejs," replied Collins, "you will have
to"meet me somecday."
JUDGE TAKES A HAND.
"And when we do," retorted Johnson.
"you Will run just as you did before."
The Interchange had started so suddenly
that the Judge did not take a hand till It
waÂ°s over. He sternly told Collins that
Johnson had treated him with every,
courtesy and asked that Collins show the
same courtesy to Johnson. "I have noth
ing to do with your animosities," con
tinued the Judge, "and these personal al
lusions must cease. What I desire is that
the position of the defendant be denned."
Collins reoeated his statements as to
Johnson's argument and the Judge repri
manded him, saying his remarks were
uncalled for. He was willing to listen to
a proper argument, but to nothing of
that sort he had just heard.
"What I want," retorted Collins. "Is that
the court shall take the law In the prop
er way."
"The matter stands submitted," curtly
announced the Judge, and Collins took
an exception to the action of the court.
At 2 o'clock the Judge denied the motion
to transfer the case and Collins intimat
ed he would apply to the Supreme Court
for a writ of prohibition. The case was
continued until to-morrow morning for
the defendant to plead.

AGAINST TENOR
Tetrazzini Says She Grew
Weary of Bossi's Love and

USES HIM FOR A FOIL
Calls Herself His "Mamita"
in Telegram Produced in
Court by Attorney Peery
Lulsa Tetratzlni was naturally the
center of attraction at the trial of Julio
Zegnier Urlburu on the second charge of
felony embezzlement before Judge Lawlor
yesterday. The prima donna was dreesed
In a bronze costume that matched per
fectly with the old gold of her hair.
The climax of interest was reached
when the wonderful little songbird calmly
admitted that she had fondly loved
Rossi, a noted tenor, then grown tired of
him.
"I begged Uriburu to come to me when
I grew weary of Rossi," she said, "to
make Signor Rossi leave me."
Attorney Charles Peery. who Is defend
ing Uriburu and who defended him when
he was cleared on the former charge, was
Insistent in his questioning. Adroitly he
went relentlessly into the value of the
lady's memory for dates. Her answers
were after this fashion: "Ah, heaven!
how can one wrapped -up in her. art re
member such petty things as days and
month?" She said, however, that she re
membered the dates in connection with
the Uriburu case fairly well.
The crime with which Uriburu is
charged is the embezzlement of 2000 francs
which the prima donna intrusted to him
to send to the Sisters Damen, dressmak
ers. In Milan. He has already been ac
quitted of a similar charge respecting an
other date and amount. . . ;- â¢ >
Even the disgusted looking defendant
6miled when Tetrazzlni's telegram beg
ging him to come to her - from Mexico
was read it was signed Luisa Mamita
Tetrazzini. Mamita (little mother) is a
pet .name which Uriburu bestowed upon
the j?rlma donna ' before they were
estranged by the matter of- some unro
ntantie coin. The case will be resumed at
2- o'clock to-day.

JAMBS C. CRAWFORD
Four Chinese children of tender age sat
In Police Judge 'Cabaniss' court and wail
ed in squeaky falsetto while their mother.
Sum Ah Jung, the wife of Leung Kit, was
under; arraignment, on the charge of hav
ing embezzled. $200 worth /of golden wrist
bands fro nv Mrs. , Tong Ah, Ohong of 638
Commercial street. > ;
The little one* had i been brought there
by a moon-eyed duenna, and the prosecu

tended for theatrical effect did not either
reform their: behavior nor entirely , shut
his Honor'? . heart to; the appeal conveyed
by It He reduced the woman's bail, from I
$2000, to $15V and when she expressed 1
doubt of her ability: to obtain the'latter j
sum ac security, for her reappearance to- ,
morrow, hÂ»! said hÂ«; hoped she was mis
taken, as he neither* felt Justified in re
| leasing her without: bail nor/ desired \to
separate h;r from' her: picturesque off
spring. ThÂ»n the weeping quartet, acconv
panied her back to the prison, where she
bade them a spectacular farewell ere they
were taken home byi the duenna. V
There wrs no question of Sum Ah
Jung's guilt. Indeed, she confessed it
when Detective Braig arrested her, and
he found tne bracelets, six In . number,
where she had pawned them for $105. It
was on the pretext that she wanted to
wear the wristlets while having her photo
graph taken that she deceived Mrs. Tong
Ah Chong/. ' .. .
When the Judge displayed symptoms
of yielding to tne children's pitiful cries
and releasing, Sum Ah Jung on her own
recognizarce a special attorney, for the"
prosecution put in p. "knock" : that was
effective. There wai no danger of the
youngsters being neglected during their
mother's Incarceration, he said, and it
was evident that her maternal solicitude
there so dramatically displayed > was of
rather unreliable quahcy, inasmuch as not
very long ago she embezzled and. fled to
Oregon, leaving her family to" fare as best
it might without her. . 'Twas then his
Honor reduced her ball.

diamond pin he was 'accused of stealing
from Miss B. - Frances Rose of 1 624 Geary
street had been' restored to that* person,
who no longer desired to. prosecute; for
which reason he desired Instant dismissal
of the cas;e, as an important professional
engagement awaitedjhim ,at' Los, Angeles.";
Without expressing 1 regret, the\>Judge
continued the. hearing -until -to-morrow,
chus ; necessitating Mr. , Davis' | stay In this
city and . disappointing numerous "fans"

When he was arreated on complaint of
the woman, Mr. . Davis *to the
pre3s that her accusation! was absolutely
false, as he had never 'seen \ the pin I and
did not even know her, despite her'state

When the ofnclal t'earcher of prisoners
at the. Central Station explored the pock
ets of Peter Johnson,' arrested forjdrunk
enness, he drew forth: from one of them
the sum of $60 90 In jjold and silver. coins,
to his own great astonishment and appar
ently that of Peter, J himself. For while
it was not the first' time Peter had'under
gone a similar process In that same sta
tion, never before had any money what-
_l soever'; been found In his possession,
j' "Where," gasped the astounded "pollce-
I man,, "did you get all this dough?" ,
1 With eyes projecting like hatpegs as he
stared at the glittering pile of -wealth.
Peter murmured : "Ah dlnno. ' Nlver seen
it before." â¢ * . '
"Ye ain't been a rollln'. somebody, have
ye?" inquired the officer. But even as he
asked the question ;he â¢ felt j that it \ was
uncalled-for, because Peter's .worst known
offense consisted of inebriety, and he was
not of the caliber that "committed theft.
So when Peter indignantly declared :. that
he had not' "rolled" anybody his word
'was taken for It. \u25a0
i"But thatdoes not explain how you got
hold of all this money," said the desk
sergeant. \u25a0. -. ' -
"Somebody must a put It in me pocket
f'r a Josh," was the dazed prisoner's re
sponse. ,
"Well, it's yours until somebody else i
claims. it,. and proves property," said the
sergeant. ;"I suggest that you leave $10
of it here for bail, and when you are re
leased by the court you can. call and get
the rest of It."
"I won't hey nuthin* t' do with It," was
the unexpected declaration. ". ",'Tain't

COMMISSIONERS
GIVE CONSENT
United Bank arid ; Trust
Company Will Y Resume
Business Tliis Morning
REASONS ARE GIVEN
Deputy , Attorney General
Sturtevant Makes Expla
nation of the Situation
The officers 'and directors of *thÂ«
United Bank and Trust Company, re
ceived notice yesterday that* the Bank
Commissioners, acting under the advice
of the Attorney General, consented to
the: reopening of the bank on' the per
formance of certain conditions, hereto
fore: published. At the office of the
United Bank and Trust Company:it was
eaid yesterday afternoon that business
would be" resumed'at 10 o'clock to*-day.
The money, to 'pay all depositors is on
hand, so ; Deputy Attorney General
Sturtevant Informed the Bank Com
missioners in a communication, in
which, the situation was reviewed. The
letter. from Mr. Sturtevant is as fol-_
lows: - - â¢- \u25a0
On the 20th day of October, 1005, pursuant to
t ha facts which then appeared to your honor
able board, you passed c resolution to the ef
fect that the United Bank and Trust Company
be put Into Involuntary liquidation; thereafter,
pursuant to said resolution, you took charge of
flaid corporation, as provided by law, and im
mediately notified this ofnee of your, action in
the premises. Such action on" your part was
based on the grounds that said corporation had
been guilty of certain unsare practices In the
transaction of ! Its business and that said cor
poration was insolvent. Thereafter, on Octo-'
ber 23, after certain conferences with the rep
resentatives of the United Bank and Trust!
Company, your honorable board specified cer
tain particulars to the representatives. of said
bank ; a." | the reasons which | had prompted the
Bank Commissioners .to taÃe the action above
mentioned. ! Those specifications r called atten
tion to the fact. that the then board of direct
ors had been guilty of certain unlawful acts
and of certain unlawful prices; that there was,'
on *aid date, an apparent snortage in the ac
count of bills 'receivable in the sum of $6000;
that the capital stock of the corporation \u25a0\u25a0 was
Impaired ; j that said corporation was insolvent.
: v 'CHANGES MADE.
Since these matters were before you- the
stockholders of ..the .United Bank and Trust
Company have; made many changes, some of
which may be specified as follows:
| First â The officers -. and directorate of said
bank j have been entirely changed and at the
present time -the board or directors does not
include a. single person who was previously on
the board of directors. . Also, the former, presi
dent and manager has resigned, his resignation
haa been accepted, and Mr. I. Freeman has
been elected ' president.
Second- 1 - Certain missing promissory notes
have been found, and, according to i the report
of , your expert, Mr. Allen Knight, the account
of. bills receivable at the present time appears
to bs correct. 'â¢ -
Third â The present board of directors has le
gally passed and caused to be enforced an or-
Cer abolishing the so-callea Dranch , banks.
;Fourthâ The present .board of directors has
arranged to convert : bomethlng over $20,000
worth of the bonds of ' tne United Abstract
Company into "cash. , ".
Fifth â The present board of directors haa ar
ranged for the payment Into its treasury of
about $48,033 81. -
". Sixth â The present board of directors has
caused the legal steps to be taken looking
toward, the retirement of all of the notes Ille
gally, taken In payment of subscriptions to the,
capital stock of the bank, and It has also taken
steps looking toward the Immediate reimburse
ment of the present impaired ' capital -of . thÂ»
bank.
\u25a0KEWBOAIID NOT RESPONSIBLE.
Now, "in so far as any unlawful" acts may
have been committed by. me ; former board , of
directors, such directors are still responsible In
thfc proper proceeding hereafter to be brought
by any. interested person, and the new board
of directors" Is not responsible for .what Its
predecessor did. The bank , having converted
certain of. lts assets Into money and arranged
for an Immediate deposit In the bank of $18,
000, - there \u25a0 will . than be .In ' the vaults of the
bank mere ' than enough money to pay . every
depositor, who may- call f6r j his . deposit. - -
\u25a0' The foregoing additional ) facts, .If .properly
pleaded, would constitute a defense to any ac
tion, which this office would be entitled to com
mence' against â¢ the United' Bank and Trust
Company pursuant to. the resolution -of your
honorable board herelnabove referred to.
, Such being the situation, I am of the opinion,
and 1 therefore advise you that the reasons
for forcing the United I'anK and Trust Com
pany Into involuntary liquidation : have ceased
to exist, 1 and that' the present officers \u25a0of â¢ the
said j corporation should -be allowed to resume
control of the affairs of the- bank.. '
- The retirement of the so-called stock notes
and the reimbursement or the capital-stock are
matters that can' hereafter be attended to by
the officers of the bank without dangr to the
interest â¢ of : the depositors.' If the .officers. of
the bank proceed to take theae steps, then It
would seem that the corporation will be .. en
tirely free of any objection which has been
called to my attention. ._ - .

CONSTRUCTION
TO BEGIN SOON
Supervisors Order Building
r of the Geary Street Road
A\Tien Plans Are Completed
SCHMITZ SCHEME FAILS
Attempt to Make Cheap Po
litical Capital Out of Pro
posed Improvement' -'-Fails
The attempt of the Schmitz adjmln
istration to force the Board of Super
visors to begin immediate construction
\u25a0ot the new portion of the proposed
municipal Geary-street road, commenc
ing at Point Lobos and Fifth avenues
and running along Point Lobos avenue
to Tenth avenue to Fulton, street, came
to naught yesterday. The board de
cided to await the preparation of the
plans for the present portion of the
road and to order the construction of
the road In its entirety.
This was deemed advisable in view
of the statement made by Engineer J.
C. Stut, who prepared the plans, that
from- an engineering standpoint It
would be a disadvantage to the city to
build the new portion first and the old
portion afterwards. Stut said the city
would save several thousand dollars
by building the entire -road at the same
time and caused a laugh when he said
there might be a political advantage
In building the new portion first.' >
The .proceedings developed that on
July 10, 1905. the City Engineer was
directed to prepare plans for the road
running from Market and Geary street 3
to Fifth avenue and Fulton street, to
gether with an extension to Tenth ave
nue and Fulton streets.. The City En
gineer filed the plans for the exten
sion with the Supervisors la3t Satur
day and the Schmitz faction took oc
casion to make some cheap political
capital in a pitiable effort to compel
Immediate construction of a > piece of
the road from which It abjectly backed
flown in the. light of the statement
made by Engineer Stut.
DEFENDS SUPERVISOR.
Supervisor Brandensteln rose to a
defense of Supervisor d'Ancona. who
has been unjustly accused of delaying:
the construction of the road, saying
that It was due to D'Ancona that the
appropriation -of $350,000 for. the pur
pose was made. D'Ancona called at
tention to the fact that Mayor Schmitz
had the ordinance directing the prep
aration of the plans In his possession
for two .weeks before signing it and
said there could be no harm, in wait
ing three weeks more, when the entire
plans would be completed. City En
gineer Woodward said" tfie. adoption of
the plans for the extension would fa
cilitate the construction of the road
and the Mayor said this would be ad
visable in view of the notification given
by .the Geary-Btreet Railway Company
that It would bring injunction pro
ceedings to restrain the city from con
fiscating the rails and roadbed to which
it laid claim. Brandensteln replied
that in that event the city would have
an extension built, which would be
U3eless if .work were prevented on the
remainder of the road.
Then ensued a wrangle. over the parlia
mentary propriety of the proceedings, and
It was decided ' to' take -up the adoption
of the partial plans for consideration.
D'Ancqna argued that the principle in
volved was the same as if the City Archi
tect were directed to prepa/e plans for a
schoolhouse and he submitted plans for
the basement.
TO BUILD ENTIRE ROAD.
"I think the franchise' of the Geary
street road has expired,? said Supervisor
Comte, "and it_ belongs to the city. The
proper .way is to build i the entire road,
whether it, pleases^ some people or not
or . whether It gets -votes or not.
Let the courts pass on. the Question. If
we build the new portion of the road and
the decision Is adverse to the city we will
have expended $140,000 uselessly." _-
"The streets over which the road now
runs belong: to the city.*' said D'Ancona,
"and if the company persists in running
its~cara after it is notified to stop doing
so the police can step in. To build the
new portion !of the. road separately might
invalidate the entire, proceedings, and it
would' be unbusinesslike and uneconom
ical." . " '\u25a0
Here Supervisor Gallagher, came to,' the
rescue of the Mayor and said that in view
of the statement made, by Engineer Stut
it would be wise to await the completion
of the plans for the entire road before
inviting bids for any portion thereof.
D'Ancona then Introduced the resolution,
which he said was unnecessary, that the
Board of Supervisors Intends, as it has
always done, to proceed with the con
ntruction of the Geary street road imme
diately on receipt of the complete plans
for the system..
