Sunday happily passed in St. Peters

The Social Democrats and revolution

and It was Intended to form gigantic
processions representing the various
industrial organizations in the suburbs
and flying red flags and txar the bod
ies of the "martyrs" in state through
the center of the city. These proces
sions were to unite at th<? Kasan Ca
thedral, where the passions of the
crowd might be fired by revolutionary
orators.
I^ate last night, however, when it be
came known that General Trepoff wonld
not permit a big demonstration and the
Mayor Issued a proclamation saying that
the streets w*re no piace for the airing
of political grievance, the Socialist lead

for President Roosevelt as president of

sion" not to accept a; second term; that
In some circles it had been predicted that

being circulated around \ Steilacoom in
connection with the case of Henry Wil

to death by John Sherland with one of i
the heavy rubbers : that the patients use :
to polish the floors. One who :. was for
a long tlrae connected with the asylum
in official capacity is authority for th<s
following statement: .
"Henry Williams was not killed by
John Sherland beating him with a rub
ber. The Coroner's investigation shows
that he -vaa knocked f down first -by a
blow In the face, evidently delivered . by
a strong man. .The-injuries [ on his body
which caused his deathvcould "not have
been Inflicted in the manner stated. The
injuries which .caused Williams' death
were inflicted by - a pair- of â¢ heavy boots.
He was kicked to death. .< By whom, an

the actions of the Mayor in this cam

Â«very Catholic, as he has not only tried
to use the church for political purposes
but has not lived up to its teaching:.*!.
Never lias there been a man in office,
said the pastor, who has been such a
poor Judge of good timber. The public
confidence has been shaken by the men
appointed on the boards until it Is im
possible for the city to lioat its bonds.
TliÂ»- members of the boards have been
appointed without the slightest regard
to fitness or ability and in every case
corruption exists to the fullest extent.
The police have been corrupted by J
the Mayor and the commission and all

SAN FRANCISCO. Cal.. October 30. 1905:
At a meeting of members of the Har of this city, held this day. It was
tin&nlmously resolved that publicity should bo given to the following state-
ment by the undersigned: I - \u25a0:
; Believing that It Is our special duty to aid every citizen to a wiso
â¢election of law officers, we earnestly submit the â¢following reasons for our
choice. for the office of District Attorney:'. \u25a0 â¢' \u25a0 \u25a0
v->r The duties -of the office, generally, are to prevent crime as - well as to
punJph crimiJials. and an able, fearless and honest District Attorney will
\u25a0work as much prevention as punishment: for the certainty of punishment Is
the surest means to prevent crime, as has been notably demonstrated \u25a0â¢ -by \u25a0
tlie splendid work of Governor Polk of Missouri. 'and tor. .Jerome of New
York, who earned national reputation* us District Attorneys.
.While the general duty of our District Attorney is to purge this city of
riim". It must be borne in mind:
First, that he appoints seven assistants, four of whom have entire
charge of police court prosecution:
Second, he appoints four assistants who control the issuance of ; warrants
and the fixing of bail, and who handle over $300,000.00 yearly In -bail money
Thlrd. be acts as legal adviser to the Grand, Jury. the. Police_Department,
the Health Department and the Coroner.
Fourth. It is his duty, to draw informations and Indictments. ..â¢ \u0084,-. -
Fifth. In a word, it depends on his ability, honesty and firmness whether
crime shall be lessened In the city. -
Inasmuch as the criminal law is full of fine "points, and criminals ;*; * are
defended by shrewd and able counsel, ; no District Attorney can \u25a0 perform his
duties rightly unless lie has had a lanr c experience in the law. Mr. Langdon's
experience 1Â« as a teacher, not as a lawyer. Mr. Brandensteln *has been for
many years past In the active practice of the law, and his record in the Board
of Supervisors has proven his ability, courage -and persistence In" successfully
fighting fraudulent schemes, no matter how rich or powerful their promotors:
, We believe that In all qualities necessary for tho very; important office of
District Attorney, the administration of which must depend on, one: man, Mr.
Brandenntcln Is pre-eminently fitted ana therefore earnestly recommend . him:
to the voters of San Francisco.

Rev. David Evans of Grace Episcopal

men of his congregation yesterday to

He said in part:
Thy man who ha* a vote and does not cast it
Is In tho position of the wn-ant in the parable.

i Just such a divinely given talent Is the ballot
placed In every man's 1 ' hand. The citizen who
fails to cact that ballot fairly and Equarely for
I the candidate who In his honest and earnest
I conviction will ' give the best service to the
' community at large is guilty of a monstrous
crime in the sight of God and man.
Half of the great reforms have been 'Von by
independent men *ho have had the courage to

to stand In the. splendid limelight of their own

Sworn in .on Election Day
Not thtv least factor that will con
tribute to the defeat "of Ruef , and
Bchmltz to-morrow at the hands of the
voters of' Ban Francisco will .be , the
thorough work done In the districts by
Republican and Demoorutic workers
under thu direction of i-erry H. New
berry. Ever since # the \Kuslon. Cam
paign Committee began' its. vvprk spe
cial efforts, have been devoted to
cleansing the voting roils in each pre
cinct. from illegal rcelstration, deaths
and removals of voters.,
From the beginning the fusionists
have realized that! cvÂ«ry effort Would
bo made by Ruef to retain domination
of local politics and ina,t one of his
strongest weapons would be coloniza
tion and illegal .registration, and. that
the names pf dÂ»md men and absentees
would be.. voted In. dozens if careful
supervision was not Instituted.
As a result of theTlaburs of the work
ers In the districts' every. ' house, has
been visited and, the fact that its .'regis
tered occupants art) still living .mere
has been verified.. Challenge lists com
prising names of men on the voting
rolls but not living at their given ad
dress have been compiled and ft' is cer
tain the election to-morrow will be al
most entirely free frpm fraud.
Yesterday, all day long, the men who
are to constitute the.' fusion "watchers"
in the polling booths to-morrow were
instructed in the. 'technicalities, .of ,the
voting machines, at the fusion head
quarters. 1. Harris spent the entire day
instructing ,the election officers to see
that the machines aic started at zero
and If a certain number is taken for a
starting point, that number snail be re
corded for reference when the^ polls
close and subtracted from the total
vote. . .
Watchers were told to stay In the
booths as much .as possible, but if com
pelled to. leave -to do so when things
are going quietly and call for <t volun
teer watcher. If things are, not going
well fusion headquarters, will know
about it and meet the situation. â¢ '
The officers were instructed to go
over the. rolls at noontime and s'eo if
tfiere were any of their personal friends
that had not voted and to see that these
stay-at-homes did so.
The men were ordered .to* report to
night to their district headquarters and
secure badges, tickets and .baJlpt. cards
and to .be Instructed;- as to' verifying
the reading of the tallies, by the in
spector when. 'the machines are .opened
after the voting-has ceased. The offi
cers, were instructed to see that the
curtain / lever." is padlocked! .. and' the
party ticket, knobs locked before, the
back of the machine is opened. ,

Sunday Listen-
'in^ to" .Labor Nominees
Five thousand people gathered within
the walls of Central Park yesterday aft
ernoon and cheered heartily " for every
candidate on the Union Labor party
ticket. Mayor Schmitz was tendered , ah
dvatlon,,as he entered the grounds and
.the cheering was continued until long
after he had taken his seat. Other speak
ers addressed the crowd during the course
jf the afternoon, and it was not. until
after 4 o'clock that the meeting was con
cluded. - . . . . ;
P. H. McCarthy passionately decried
Francis J. Heney as the enemy of or
ganized labor and a man not tit for pub
lic trust.; This outcry was greatly ap
preciated'as a delectable piece of humor
by those in the audience who had fol
lowed' the cateer* of .McCarthy, and; a
mental comparison '. 6f this man and
Heney. who has so successfully driven
the Government grafters to cover, left k
doubt in the 'minds of many as to the
trustworthiness of McCarthy's statement.
Mayor Schmitz spoke for a few minutes
'only. ,He stated ' that he had been a
much-abused man during the campaign,'
but that In his heart he had forgiven Ihls
enemies. He promised that he would con
tinue to act In the future as he had done
in the past, provided he was elected
Mayor, giving equal rights to all. He re
iterated hlB time-worn claim^that no graft
existed in his administration, and â¢ asked
the people .to vindicate: him jby the elec

Undismayed by the boasts., pf boodle
that Ruef,v/ould carry, every district of

: league fought with determined vigor. In
the poolrooms, on the streets and In pub

Ruef would win the convention, but the
betting odds did not discourage the sup
porters of the league.
The eventful day of election came. The
league won. and Ruef lost. Never before
in the history of San Francisco was a
battle won ugairist such odds, but in the
lexicon of the league there was no such
word as fall.
The grafters, stunned, demoralized, but
desperate in their frenzy, attempted to ;
gain by bribery, trickery "and lntimlda
tipn the, advantage which they lost in
open combat on a fair field. Again and
again the boodlers were cornered and

CAMPAIGN
CONTINUES
ON SUNDAY
Great Political Meetings Are
Held in New York '-and
Hearst Enthusiasts Pa
rade \ Through the Streets
Special Dispatch to Tht Call.
NEW YORK,, Nov. s.â Unprecedented
In the annals of Manhattan was the Sun
day, nighty conclusion of municipal
campaign. The "rank hysteria .which
brought forth the letter of Mr. Cleveland
passed Into a political frenzy.- and the
central portion of the city was for hours
filled with parading crowds that cheered
the nominees of 'the Municipal Ownership
party, jeered and hissed every Tammany
banner and derided McClellan. Murphy
and Tammany Hall. While this was In
progress two great meetings were being
held, one in the Hippodrome by the Mc-
Clellan Allied Trades League, and the
other In Madison Square Garden by the
Municipal Ownership League. . > Smaller
meetings were being addressed In various
theaters by orators In behalf of the two
leading candidates, who are rending the
Democratic and Republican parties In
twain. In point of numbers the meeting
for municipal ownership in the Garden
was' the. more Impressive demonstration.
Tens' of thousands of persons were turned
away,, while those who could "not "gain
access tothe Hippodrome., were counted
by thousands." . . ' . ..Â»'â¢.'
Ther.e was an ugly and defiant temper
on the part "of the- supporters of Hearst
and the most 'scornful defiance of Tam
many that' the city has known In many
years. [ The police looked on and pre
served order.' but no attempt was made to
restrain the tumultuous ardor of the vast
throng that howled and jostled Its path
through the highways.
To all this there. was a sensational pre
lude at 2 o'clock this morning In the
Grand Central? Palace, where a ball was
being hefd by the sHebrew Association.
Hearst was dragged out of bed to attend
this ball, and there, two hours after mid
night, he spoke to many thousands of
men and women from the East Side. It
was one of the most remarkable inci
dents ever known In New York campaign
ing. â¢
The sensational disclosures of an alli
ance of Republican workers with the
Tammany organization and the treachery
of the ' Republican machine In the Twen
ty-ninth Assembly District In sending out
to voters a request that they vote for
Flammer for District Attorney tended to
Inflame the public mind regarding the as
tounding false pretense that has marked
the entire campaign so far as the or
gariizatlon of former Governor Odell is
concerned. The incident of the Instruc
tions to the voters -of the Twenty-ninth
District to support Flammer, who Is no
longer the nominee of his party, although
the law has kept his name on the ballot,
brought the treachery to District Attor
ney Jerome very near home to Ivlns. the
Republican candidate for Mayor. To the
: circular the name of Senator Elsberg
was appended, and Senator Elsberg Is the
campaign manager of Ivlns.. ,
Each party to-day continued to predict
the election of Us mayoralty candidate.
Controller Grout estimated that McClel
lan would have 20.000 plurality. In. the
city It Is understood that "inside Tam
many figures for Osborn are 6000 plurality.
Halpln, president of the Republican
County Committee, gives Ivins 217,000,
Hearst 204,000 and^ McClellan 170.000. =
Representative Timothy D. Sullivan In
a speech at a rousing McClellan. meeting
in Miner's Theater . went ; on record as
predicting that the Sixth Assembly
District would give McClellan 3700^ plu
rality. This- is 522 better than it did for
Judge Herrlck last year.' â¢
The' betting continues to -be paralysed
by the unusual, and puzzling conditions
prevailing.- .
SHEKIFF BACKS UEFORMEIIS.
Will Attempt to Prevent Election
FraudM la Philadelphia. â¢ -
-PHILADELPHIA. Nov. s.â The Sheriff
of the county of Philadelphia has Issued a
proclamation giving notice to all that
they must abstain from interfering with,
the election officers in the performance
of their duties next Tuesday. The issu
ing of a proclamation of this character
is rather unusual. It calls on all citizens
to render full aid and assistance to tha
deputy sheriffs appointed by the Sheriff.
'-, In the campaign just closed the Repub
lican organization and the city party ad
herents have made counter charges of
contemplated fraud.
Colonel Sheldon Potter, director of pub
lic ' safety, who is a leader on the re
form side, has Instructed the police that
they must see that the election laws are
enforced. On the other hand, the Re
publican organization is charging that
the police are in politics; that they .will
intimidate .voters and arrest Republican
election officers on false charges and in.
other ways exceed their authority.
In this connection the organization has
planned to have lawyers in every one
of the forty-two wards on election day
to look after the Republican election of
ficers and Republican Magistrates will twÂ»
On hand to take ball In case Republican
voters or watchers are arrested. The City
party has also taken similar steps.
The. committee of seventy which or
ganized the City party made the an
nouncement to-night that it â¢ would
promptly prosecute all people committing
fraud on election day and that $10,000
has been' set aside to be paid In rewards
to those instrumental in securing the ar
rest and conviction of election offenders.

Interest Centers In Contest for Meu-
trnuot Governor.
BOSTON, Nov. 5. â Although in for
mer years State campaigns In Massa
chusetts have virtually ended on the>
Saturday night preceding- election day,
the programme for this year is an ex
ception to the general rule and the
contest will be conducted with vigor
up to midnight to-morrow.
Party -triumph at the polls is pre
dicted by both Republican and Demo
cratic leaders. The Democrats claim
that Charles W. Bartlett. the candi
date for Governor, will be elected by a
small majority.' The Republican cam
paign managers forecast a substantial
plurality - for Curtis Guild Jr.. tha
party's standard bearer.
\u25a0 The. most interest of the campaign
centers In the contest for Lieutenant
Governor.' According to Democratic
claims Henry M. Whitney, the Demo
cratic'candidate, will be elected by a
wide margin. The Republicans, how

- * .BLAZE PRODUCED BY FRICTION
DAMAGES THE ALAMEDA MOLE
Ferry Boat Chafes Creosoted Piles, Causing a Costly Fire
HGHTIXG THE FIRE AT THE ALAMEDA MOLE FROM THE BAY AND FROM THE DOCK. THE TUG ALERT AND THE
FIREBOAT GOVERNOR MARKHAM PREVENTED THE FIRE FROM SPREADING TO THE NEW DEPOT. THE DAMAGE
IS ESTIMATED AT $12,000. Â« - - i
A peculiar fire of peculiar origin
nearly destroyed the new Alameda mole
yesterday afternoon. While the ferry
boat Newark was trying to steam out
on the 2:40 trip, the stiff north wind
jammed her against the south side of
the slip. The friction set fire to the
piles and in a few minutes the entire
eoutfi side of the pier was ablaze. The
damage is estimated at about $12,000.
Two switch engines were quickly run I
out on the pier to fight the blaze, which
grained head y.- ay every second, â¢ fanned
by the north wind. As soon as the fire
was sighted from the San Francisco
side, the tug Alert and the fire-boat
Governor Markham started across. The
heavy sea made it difficult for them to
get within fighting distance of the fire.
A gar.g of men was quickly put to
work tearing up planks in the wharf
to prevent the fire reaching the new
depot. A shifting- of the wind to the
\u25a0west threatened to carry the flames in
that direction, but the Governor Mark
liam worked into the slip and fought
back thÂ«, blaze with the full force of
her vrater batteries. Before & o'clock
the fire \u25a0was well under control.
Crowds of excursionists were held at
the mole by the conflagration. Several
tim*s the Newark tried to worl# in past
the flames to take them off, but had to
abandon the attempt. The excursion
ists had to remain at the depot until
nearly six oclock.
\u25a0When the Newark started from her
Blip, she made her way out, rubbing
rousrhly against the piles. Smoke as- ,
cended from the pier and there was
s smell of burning wood. Nothing was
thought about it at the time, however,
U the Newark had often caused smoke
to rise when rubbing against the wharf
In rough weather.
PILES BURN LIKE TINDER.
The north wind, however, had been
blowing against the dock for several
days and the piles were dry as tinder.
Besides all the woodwork of the pier
bad been saturated with creosote. In
rubbing against the piles, the Newark
ground part of the woodwork into small
splinters. These were easily ignited by
the friction. A tiny blaze, fanned by
the wind, quickly caught one of the
piles and in a few minutes the entire
couth side of the slip was on fire.
The switch engine quickly ran up- to
where the blaze was hottest and start
ed a stream of water. As soon- as its
tank was emptied another took Its place.
But the velocity of the wind increased
and the flames from the creosote-soak
ed wood leaped higher and higner.
The blaze was "rapidly gaining on the
switch engines when the tuÂ£s arrived.
The Alert worked In as close as it could
to the head of the pier and began
to pour a steady stream upon the fire.
The Governor Markham, buffeted about
on the boiling waters, edged into the
Blip and caught the flames from the
rear to keep them away from the new
depot building.
For nearly an hour it was nip and
tuck between the blaze and the flre
fighting apparatus. ' Flying cinders
were blown to the roof of the depot
and burning brands, tossed about by
the wind, flew in all directions.
.'" ' DEPOT IS THREATENED. -
Once or twice sparks from the fire
threatened to Ignite the depot building,
but a crowd of workman stationed
there were watching them. Both the
tugs at several stages of the fight were

to the flre, the Alert was several times
pounded up against the burning piles.
Her deck house and sides were slight
ly sforched, but she escaped any seri
ous injury.
A gang of men was hastily collect
ed by the superintendent of the mole
and put to work tearing up the planks.
Crowbars were plied vigorously and
soon the bay for some distance around
was filled with - charred j woodwork.
When the fire seemed almost under
control it would start up 'again at un
expected points, the creosote render
ing the woodwork highly inflammable.
Even after it was declared extinguished
the tugs lingered as near as they dared,
expecting it to break out again.
The Alameda mole v.-as completely
destroyed by flre early in the morning
of November 20, 1902. The damage was
estimated at $289,000. Six railway
coaches and the old depot were totally
destroyed. Only the plucky flght of the
fire tugs and the engines prevented a
like catastrophe yesterday.
The fire was clearly visible from the
San Francisco side of the bay. Cinders
from the blaze dropped on the decks of
ferry steamers on the ivey Route and
the broad gauge ferry.

result of a battle this afternoon between
a company of State guards and Frank
Ball's outlaw band, two soldiers were

have teen three men fall. \u25a0
The fight was' conducted behind boulders
and trees and lasted nearly two hours.
The retreat consumed another hour and
the soldiers are not yet att backjn town.
The attacking party "of soldiers did not
make a direct charge, but sought to take
the enemy in the flank. They would like
ly have accomplished: this but for the
discharge of a gun, which gave warning
of their approach.
The attacking party had been discov
ered, and from the doors and windows of
an old house, supposed to be an illicit still,
the outlaws sallied.. They were quick to
discover the enemy, and delivered a hot
fire, so hot that no soldier could advance
up either of the two ravines leading to
the summit' of the hill; .'
Retreat was finally -ordered and down
the mountain side tlie soldiers picked
their their way. flrinu as' they . dodged

Fire Sweeps Over Two Large
Ranches; and Threatens to
Reach Town of Bed Bluff
HUNDREDS- OP MEN OUT
North Wind Sweeps Flames
Beyond Their Control and
Enormous Loss Is Result
RED BLUFF, Nov. s.â One of the most
disastrous field and brush fires in the his
tory of Tehama County is now raging
about two miles north of this city on the
Wilcox and Trede ranges. An extraor
dinarily high north wind Is blowing, and
with the rapidity with which the firei is
traveling fear is felt that it may reach
Red Bluff to-night. Hundreds of men; are
now. fighting the flames and the Cone
Ranch Company is preparing to send out
a-, large crew from the/ranch,, who will
beequipped to work all night. About 10,
000 acres jof â¢ One sheep -and , cattle j range
on Wilcox â¢ brothers'; range ; and the : Trede
range have already been destroyed, and it
is not deemed -possible to â¢ check the 'fire
until it reaches the Sacramento River.
It is understood that the fire. was set by
C. L. Cofer at his home, nine miles north
of her, to clear off brush land. The high
wind caused it to get beyond his control.
The territory already burned over is about
six. miles. in length and from four to five
miles in width.
Fear is entertained that the fire will
cross "Blue Tent and Dibble creeks, as at
this season of the year the creeks are
dry.
BIG FIRE IN "GLENN.
Flames Do Much Damage to Several

WILLOWS, Nov. 5.â A fire broke out
Saturday; afternoon on the, Baylor
.place. Just below the town of Jacinto
in Glenn County. A strong north wind
was blowing at the time and the fire
soon got beyond control. . In twenty
four hours it has traveled nine miles
and its width , varies from one to two
miles. The area \, burned over> Is for
the. most.; part '-.stubble and the loss In
produce will" not be great. Fences
have j been destroyed on jj thÂ« land, tra-'
versed, but farm buildings have, ;In
most Instances, been saved by ..their

While. the news received from the prov
inces indicates that something like nor
mal conditions are being restored in many
regions, the situation continues grave In
the. Baltic provices, the Caucasus, Odes
sa- and other places in the south, where
the outrages generally have taken an
anti-Jewish' nature.
Anti-Semitic rioting has been re
ported to be going on in Khersoff,
Ekaterinaslov, Vasilkoff, Vallgua,
Ivano-Vozozsenk, Moghileff, KeJ^t and
Uman. At' Akkerman 'many were
killed. The Cossacks- assisted in the
pillaging. â¢
AMERICANS IN DANGER.
From Riga Consul Birnholdt telegraphs
to Charge d'Affaires . Eddy to-day that
the situation was extremely serious; that
American interests 'were endangered -and
demanded military^ protection. Eddy im
mediately saw Count Lamsdorff. the For
eign Minister, who promised to afford
protection. Birnholdt later telegraphed
that .a military guard had been placed
at the consulate.
A' similar. "appe"al arrived , to-day from
George R. Martin, v the "American Consu
lar Agent. at Rostof-on-Dcn, where also
there are American interests. Eddy ms
patched a note to the British. German
and Austrian embassies and they prac
tically united in joint representations, to
which Count -Lamsdorff and General Tre
poff promised that all foreign interests
would be safe-guarded.
Other dispatches received from Odessa
say; -that I the Cossacks and . infantry
fought a regular battle with Jews and
revolutionaries, who were concealed in
houses, and estimated the dead at 300
and the wounded -as \u25a0 more than -2000.
' Press aceonnts from Odessa rl vc de
tails of horrible atrocities committed.
The tongue* of Jews nfrf torn out by
the roots, nails were driven jln the
heads of living' : persons and' other vlc
tlniH were rolled !\u25a0 spiked barrels, but
these reports must be accepted with a
large amount of caution.
No authentic figures are available from
Rostof-on-Don, but the dead are placed
at hundreds, and it seems. definitely es
tablished that the Cossacks participated
in the pillage there. ' ;
AMNESTY UKASE UNPOPULAR.
The amnesty proclamation, with its
confused phraseology, which even law
yers in the assembly are unable to con
strue clearly, is not received here .with
full satisfaction on account of its.limita
tions. The_general cry from all quarters
is ' for a declaration^, on broader lines,
which, k is felt, cannot be long delayed.
Even the Conservative Novoe Vremya.
the Government supporter through thick
and thin, calls for a more comprehensive
proclamation on amnesty.
The bureau of the League of Leagues,
representing all classes and professions,
to-night voiced this demand in a formal
resolution,' which was sent to all the pa
pers in Russia for publication. |
\u25a0From all over Russia 'comes news of the
release of political . prisoners under the
amnesty proclamation. There were many
pitiful -incidents connected' with the re
uniting of families here in St. Petersburg.
The authorities gave each person released
20 cents to pay. his cab fare and turriea

ODESSA," Nov. 5.^-A tour of the city

ish"* quarters suffered worst and the
principal streets, with few exceptions,
were untouched. Russian shops ara
marked with crosses painted on the
shutters and the private houses with
ikons, so 1 as Â»to protect them from the
i mobs. Peasants armed with knives and
scythes tried to reach | the city on Sat
urday to loot the place, but they were
driven back by the soldiers. Â«
The casualties in Saturday's disturb

preceding three" days which have been
'< verified number nearly 5600." The plun
dering continued early*-thls. morning in
the outlying districts, but to-day the

population is still anxious. > .'
The latest accounts of the devasta
tion in the Jewish quarter added hor
ror to the situation. Besides numer
ous mills, all the bakery shops and
nearly 600 homes have been destroyed
The Jews killed were mutilated with re
volting barbarity. Heads were batter
ed with hammers; -nails were driven
into the bodies, eyes were gouged out
and ears severed. , Many bodies were
disemboweled and in some casÂ«3 petro
leum was poured over the sick found
hiding in cellars and they were burned
to death.
It Is alleged that the police and sol
diers everywhere marched at the head
of the mobs, inciting them to destroy
the Jews by crying: The Jews have
killed our Emperor," and similar ex
pressions. While the mobs were en
gaged in the slaughter the soldiers
busied themselves stealing the cash
and jewels, leaving the household
goods to the mobs. The owners of
many houses got rid of the bandits by
the payment of a ransom to the police.
The police prevented any one from
arresting rioters and also prevented
Red -Cros3 workers from aiding "the
wounded, actually firing upon those en
gaged in this work. A band of students
removed much of the stolen property
to the university, while they also took
twelve bodies of anti-Jewish dem
onstrators, whose relatives to-day be
selged the university, claiming the
corpses and demanding the release of ',

By their mild and natural action! th*Sii!Ss* *WATER FRONT FEELS WRATH
OF HIGH NORTH WIND.
HEAVY SEAS GN B AY
Gale Causes Minor
Damage to the
Shipping.
Many Small Craft
Suffer From
Storm.
\u25a0Tht strong north wind made matters
livelyvalpng the water front yesterday.
The usually placid waters of the bay
were /tasoed into a sea of foam, which
dashea tip with furious force against
the sjtiips moored alongside the docks.
Many were moved away to anchorages
In the bay. The ferry boats came in
for a full share of the wind's wrath.
The high seas washed over their bows
and flooded their forward decks. Many
passengers were frightened and many
were made seasick. During 1 the height
of the rale the Sausailto cut out some
of her trips.
While there were no casualties of a
serious nature reported, there were a
number of instances of minor damages
to shipping, and aleo to some of the
dock*.
The grale commenced blowing early
In the morning. It came straight from
the north. It lulled a bit about noon,
Â»>ut at 2 o'clock in the afternoon it
begras again, with renewed vigor and
kept up until sundown. Everybody
was on the alert along the docks. All
the tucÂ» had steam up and ready to
lend assistance in ca6e of need. Crow
ley'e launches and hit pontoon had a
narrow escape from being wrecked.
When the sale was raging at its
helghth In the morning, the huge mass
of piles that are being used in the con
struction of the coal bunkers in the
Vallejo street dock broke away from
Its moorings and began sweeping to
ward Crowley's landing. The boatman
had, however, been looking for such an
occurrence, and at once got his boats
out into the bay and ran them ail down
to Meiggs Cove. They had barely got
out into the open bay when the boom
of logs struck with a grinding crash
on the side of the pontoon.
The British ship Mandelay, lying
alongside the sea wall, was being
hammered so vigorously by wiud and
wave that the tug Sea Queen was sent
to her relief and she was towed down
to Spear-street dock. The scow Star
was beating such a lively tattoo on
Broadway wharf that the tug Relief
was summoned and the scow towed
out to Mission flats.
The North Bend and the Omega wero
also in process of being battered up
against the sea wall and they were
also towed out into the stream.
The little launch Wolverine, owned
by Beck. Wakeficld & Co.. was being:
towed from her anchorage to a place
of safety in Meigrgs Cove by the
launch Guide, when the tow line parted
Â«nd the Wolverine was swept up on
the rocky breakwater adjoining the
Fishermen's dock. Here she lay for
several minutes, beating and heaving
on the rocks until the tug Hartley
came to her rescue and hauled her up
to, the beach. The little boat had sev
eral holes stove in her bottom.
A sand scow, fully loaded, was ly
ing at anchor off Hunters Point when
the sale struck her and swept her up
to the beach, where she was landed,
high and dry, receiving damage to her
hull.
It was reported that a scow sloop
drifted from her moorings and struck
Mission Rock, where she sank.
The Montecello, bound for Vallejo,
had to make several attempts before
ehf> finally got away from her dock at
Mission stroet.
Altogether shipping had the tough
est experience It has had for many a
month in the bay.

MONDAY NOVEMBER 6, 1905
GREAT TRADE ACTIVITY EVERYWHERE.
THE predominant features iast week were mercantile and indus
trial rather than financial. During the preceding week they were
agricultural. This stfows the changing tendency at present.
The exhibit of the week in this direction was highly\ grati
fying. Attention was largely centered upon the brilliant, showing
of the iron and steel industry, which seems to be enjoying a boom.
It -will be remen:bered that" some months ago the steel magnates
predicted that business in their line during the fall and winter would
be the largest ever known. As the industry was rather quiet at
that time not much attention was paid to this sanguine prophecy,
but it is now being fulfilled. The furnaces are running night and
cay, large orders are booked far ahead into 1906, and prompt
deliveries on new business are not only not guaranteed, but posi
tively refused. The railroad companies see so much transportation
business ahead that they are filling up the car factories with orders
for new locomotives and cars. The New York Central has just
ordered 25.000 additional cars, the Pennsylvania 41,000, and all the
other railroads in the country, are ordering more or less, to such
an extent that the total orders for cars thus far this year aggregate
225.000. again?! the record-breaking number of 195,000 in the year
1902. The locomotive works are running night and day.
These vast orders for cars and engines indicate only one thing
â an immense movement of merchandise all over the country. Of
course the abundant crops of wheat, corn, oats, cotton, etc., form
a large percentage of this movement, but general merchandise is
not far behind. In fact, all farm and factory products are extremely
active, with a consumptive demand which is siniply phenomenal.
Chicago and Missouri River points report a remarkable movement
in hides. California is breaking all records with her shipments of
potatoes to the Gulf States, the crop in the Western States, which
usually supply the South, having been cut down by unfavorable
weather. Loud complaints of car shortages are heard all over the
country. Pennsylvania wants more cars for her coal, Minneapolis
for her flour, the demand for which has vastly increased during the
past fortnight; the Northwest cannot move all the lumber ordered
there, and the hay men of San Francisco have given up in disgust
trying to get cars to haul the hay in from the country. So it goes
all over the land. There are no signs of dull times in this exhibit.
There is a curious feature connected with. the boom in iron and
steel which it may not be amiss to mention. New York advices
say that so far from desiring an advance in prices for steel the
magnates of the industry are actually striving to prevent a run
away market in pig iron, recognizing that any violent rise in prices
now would probably result in injurious reactions later on. But
they have their hands full in checking an advance. Aside from the
wonderful demand for cars the demands for structural material for
buildings in the large cities are calling for immense quantities of iron
and steel, and this is but another convincing evidence of the
marked activity in business everywhere. In brief, no matter where
we look we see the same pronounced activity in all kinds of busi
ness, which is dwarfing all previous exhibits.
The current weekly returns of the clearing houses, however,
are not showing the large gains which they did weeks and months
ago. covering a long period. In fact, they are low. Last week they
were only 4.9 per cent over those for 1904, though all but three
of the principal cities and towns show an increase and the aggregate
clearings themselves were $2,994,900,000, a very large total. The
failures for the week were 202, against 229 for the corresponding
week in 1904.
The money and stock markets have shown no material change.
Muring the past week. Stocks go up and down every day, but the
fluctuations are individual and the general market stands about
the same. Money hovers around 3^4 to 5^2 per cent for call loans,
with plenty of it ladled out upon the market whenever rates make
much of an advance. We are not short of cash, nor do the great
financiers expect any serious shortage in the near future. Firm
rates, however, are rather favored by the banks at present, for
they serve to discourage undue speculation. It is realized that a
"speculative debauch," as one financier aptly puts it, would at once
check the present prosperity, hence cheap money would be rather
detrimental than beneficial at present.
Conditions in California remain about the same as for months.
They are all favorable and comprehend continued activity in real
estate, lively building operations, high prices for farm and orchard
products, abundant and easy money, a large and continuous im
migration of homeseekers from the East, etc. The extent of the
latter is apparent to the most casual observer of the crowds of
strangers who daily throng the sidewalks of San Francisco. - ,
It is evident that we are to have another year of prosperity
unless** something unexpected happens. This is indeed a long-con
tinued era of prosperity and surpasses the most sanguine expecta
tions of half a dozen years ago.
THE COMMITTEE ON CHILD-LABOR.
s~*\ HILD-LABOR and its evils is the subject of ethical pamphlet
( number 10, by Felix Adler, leader of the New York Society
for Ethical Culture, which is being sent out as having a pecu
liar significance in connection with a meeting of the National Child-
Labor Committee soon to be held in Philadelphia. A part of the
objects of that committee is: "To promote the welfare of society,
with respect to the employment of children in gainful occupations.
To raise the standard of public opinion and parental responsibility
with respect to the employment of children."
It appears that what the society has to work for now is not
so much new legislation on the subject, as it is for the enforcement
of laws enacted, but evaded for lack of public opinion to insist on
attention being paid to them. There are large numbers of children,
working long hours in factories and other employments, the lav.'
td the contrary notwithstanding. Parents do not hesitate to com
mit perjury in order to keep their under-age children at work and
out of school. Some sampie cases are given. One pious mother
said: "Well, I did tell a lie about George's age; may the good Lord
forgive me."
We all know the force of the argument that children under
age must work in some urgent cases, as of a widow dependent on
her son's help, the plight of large families with meager incomes,
and the like; but the ethical society claims that. excuses of that
kind are being overworked, and that under cover of the plausible
claim parents are exploiting their young children instead of aiding
them to get an education and a natural all-round development of
their child life.
Adler thinks we are in danger of forgetting our duty in this
way at the present time because of its being such an era of eager
ness for material gain: "A kind of insanity, of monomania, takes
possession of people in periods of expansion, which are the great'
danger points in human development." He makes a strong argu
ment in his urging that compulsory education must go hand-in-hand
with the child-labor movement. He says: "The appeal that comes
from them jointly is the most convincing in my judgment, and
the most just that any one can . conceive of ."
It. seems evident that if education .of children is of sufficient
value to the state for it to be made compulsory, the opportunity to
obtain education by release from gainful work must be compulsory
also. In regard to the argument that necessity knows no com
punction, it may be said that what society temporarily gains by
letting the child work to help support the family society later much

. WHEN' A MAN IS DEAD, MT
MASTERS.
THERE was a king of a peerless
land,
d mighty in power and pride was ha,
For scarcely the arch of the skies o'ar
spanned ,- ...-*'
. His domain reaching from sea to sea;
And his snbiects hastened his will to do.
And , courtiers bowed to his lightest
whim,
And all the pomp of his place he knew.
While lords and their ladies salaamed
to him.
He had but to nod, and a host obeyed, .
And a head paid the "price if the word
he said.
'Twas a wondrous game that the great
king played;
But, list ye, my masters, â¢ the king is
dead!
And pomp and power and pride of earth,
Or glory that dwells in a princely birth.
What are they all, and what their worth.
When a man is dead, my masters?
There was a lord of a yellow store,
And ever he piled it higher.
While ever he yearned for more and
more
Of the gold of hi 3 heart's desire.
And the people bowed to his store of
wealthâ -
Though scarcely to him, I trow-
In many a goblet they drank his healthâ
The health of his gold, you know-
He had but to will, and the deed was
done; . -
His was a power to bless or dread;
But what is it all when the sands have
run?
And, list ye, my masters, the man Is
dead!
And the might of wealth that our hands
have won.
Or the gold that shines to the shine of
sun.
What is it, all when the sands have, run,
And a man is dead, my .masters?
There was a man that humbly trod
In the way that the white cods bless.
No scepter was his, and no scourging
rod, ""
But his iif'Â» was a long caress
For those who suffered, for those who
sighec,
And those who had lost the way.
He healed their wounds, and their eyes
he dried,
And he taught them no more to stray;
And I do net doubt it was not in vain,
The seed- of blessing that thus he
spread;
I am sure that he finds it priceless gain,
Though mark ye, my masters, the man
is deud!
\u25a0 \u25a0
For after it all, when all is past.
*Tis the deed of love that alone may last.
And the resx Is chaff to the tempest cast,
When a raan is dead, my masters.
Attorney for the Defendantâ "He Is a
very poor man, is he not?"
The Witness â "Yes; abjectly poor."
"You mar tell the jury how you know
this to be a. fact."
"Well, ha keeps nine dogs."
"Mabel Is so charitable."
"Indeed! What makes you think so?"
"Why, she expects to attend the charity
ball."
"Mabel is almost heartbroken."
"Why so?"
"She re {used" that, eligible young Pod

"Well. Mrhat of it?" r
"Why, he never asked her again."
"The Countess feels deeply injured."
/'Why should she?"
'"Why, she paid a million dollars for the
title, ami now she understands that in
some parts of Europe one may take one's
pick for one-twentieth of that sum."
WHAT THEY TALKED ABOUT.
She was a sweet young thing, with a
longing, yearnful soul, which ever strove
to express the inexpressible. For, a long
time they had sat on the arbor seat, while
twilight began to draw its misty curtain
about them, and her beautiful thoughts
gradually had grown into a conviction
that If she had any sort of luck at all the
inexpressible might be expressed right
then and there. His vagrant thoughts
sometimes turned to her, and sometimes
to the price of calico.
"Behold yoa setting sun," she mur
mured; "how its dying rays light up the
world with the crlmson-and-gold promise
that that expiring sun shall dawn upon
the spotles glory of another day."
He rose to the occasion.
"You bet it does," he said. "And notice
how it glimmers on that tin pan."
"How like man's little life it Isâ" .
"And woman's, ' too." he interrupted,
being cesiroua of showing that he caught
the point, j \u25a0
She did not heed the interruption, while
her soulful eyes still gazed upon the sun
set. ' . ..-"'. .
"It lets In darkness; but who .may
doubt that it shall rise upon a fairer day,
the day of life, of immortality, the sweet
er, brighter day ofâ"
"Unltsss it's raining," he suggested.
She saw that her pearls were . cast be
foreâthat If, . that they were not. appre
ciated, but he was highly eligible, and so
she le: it pass and called him googoo,
and hÂ» responded in kind, for. he was
right rp on that kind of converse.
- After that: the conversation was. inter
esting to th'Â»m, but not elevating, and she
saved her longing, yearnful thoughts for
the otier young man. \u25a0\u25a0
For she was esthetic/, but no chumpess.

SECRET OF THE FORCEFUL LIFE
ANGELA MORGAN
LIVE' to-day as ; though it were the only, day you had to live. This Is
'the secret of the forceful life; the life of vitality and beauty; the only
life that Is worth while. >
, - -' Have you -not : observed that at times of earnestness and wonder;
times when you faced a crisis, made a sacrifice, decided a grave ques
'tlon; times when your soul trembled under the stress of a great grief or
a great joy, you have been ,roused all at once to a realization of something
marvelous In lifeâ something keen and beautiful, that in ordinary, moments
you did not suspect? >
. It was as though you had come suddenly upon the very core of
things; as though ' you understood In a flash the 'meaning of all living,
loving, grieving, hoping. You werÂ« at one with the whole world's pain and
Joy. Its mighty pulse was yours. - .. '
In that flash of illumination, that ecstasy of perception, you could see
how the very commonest, smallest thoughts land acts of life had a deep sig
nificance. : You could feel what power there Is in love, in \u25a0 kindness, in
" beauty, in forgiveness. It -was perfectly .clear to you that goodness throbs
at the heart of the universe.
And in the passion of that wonderful moment you made a swift re
_ solveâ a resolve to>*live ever after at your highest and. noblest; to seek
goodness and purity; to be good and pure.
This marvelous something that fired you then is an element that does
not belong alone to the exceptional day, the unusual hour. It Is a some
thing that palpitates at the heart every day, in the soul of every hour.
If we lived earnestly, eagerly, keenly, wa . would perceive this beauty,
this compelling fire, in the commonest experience of life, and we could ap
propriate it for making beautiful and vivid the colorless tasks assigned us.
We* should look Upon every day as wonderful. When we take^this
attitude .we put our souls on the alert to discover the wonder and * the
magic. â¢
Who knows what new beauties, what new â¢ powers we might discover
in the world and in ourselves If we habitually took this view of every
day 7! ; \u25a0;, . : V. \u25a0
Maeterlinck says: "All that happens to us is divinely great and we
are always in the center of a great world. But we must accustom our
selves to live like an angel who has just sprung to life, like a woman
who loves, or a man on the point of death. If you knew that you were
going to die .to-night or merely that you would have to go away and
never return, would you. looking upon men and things' for the last time,
see them in the' same light that you have hitherto seen them? Would
you not love â¢as you never yÂ»t have loved? : ' Not a single day is trivial.
It, 4s essential that this .idea should sink into our life and take root
therein.'.* â¢ "
When this idea does indeed "take root" you will find all your alms,
loves and aspirations grown lovelier and more" vigorous. Pour your whole
heart Into every day and the day will reward you by sending back to you
radiance, sweetness/ and power. . :__ ', "
Live each day as though it were the only day you had to live.
DOING DISAGREEABLE THINGS
WALLACE RICE
| T is getting to be something of a habit nowadays to smile a little pitifully
I over the practices of the older Puritans, especially the habit we attribute
\u25a0Â» to them of doing: disagreeable things â often apparently for no bet
ter \u25a0 reason than that they were disagreeable.
But there Is a great and pressing necessity for teaching every man, wom
an and child upon this earth that dlsagreable things are to be taken and en
dured without repining, quite as 1 much as the agreeable things.
Life never was intended to be all play in the temperate zone, whatever
It may become in the tropics. .In a state of nature winter food, fuel and
shelter have to be provided for while the warmer suns are shining, and all
this implies self-denial.
When we read of laws that refused a man the right to kiss his wife on
Sunday, we wonder at the absurdity of denying a husband one of the few
pleasures he obtained in an austere life, on the one day in which he had
time enough to enjoy it. That even the Connecticut blue laws did not go
so far as this makes no "difference in the argument, for the principle re
mains. , _,
"We know along similar lines that the men and women of New England
took a holy and sacred Joy in going to meeting, and yet never allowed the
meeting house to be warmed, greatly as the chill must have detracted from
the attention they were able to give the service.
This country is filled with half-baked men and women, doing mediocre
work in mediocre positions for no better reason than that they had to do
disagreeable things In the good Job they have left behind. -It all comes of
their never having been taught that one 1 must undertake drudgery when it
comes in the way of duty, must in early life prepare for the harsher things
of later life.
If the men and women of Puritan days denied themselves the delight of
kissing on the Sabbath, being duly wedded and fully authorized to kiss, it
was in a sense a preparation for the time coming when there should be no
more kissing.' If they: withheld all display of their natural affection for
their children, it was that they might the better accord them justiceâ a finer
thing than love. ; "
The young men and young women of this generation are having too
much done for their entertainment, and not nearly enough for the rugged
ness of their characters.
No nation ever yet went down to defeat from struggle against adversity;
it is the luxuries, the agreeable things, that sap their character and
strength, in nations as in men.
LUCK OF HIS WIFE'S FRIEND
IX his secret soul the man had a longing. He wished his wife could under- \u25a0
stand business. He tried to teach her. He told her all about steel and in
surance and Government bonds. The woman listened patiently, but she
never learned anything. At last the man got desperate.
"There is only one. way. to make her understand," he said. "I must arouse her
Jealousy. I will talk business to some other woman and then Sallie will put
her mind on it."
About that time Sallies friend, Elizabeth, paid her a visit. Elizabeth was a
college graduate. She had any; number of degrees and could see right through
the toughest problem that was ever propounded. ; The man saw his opportuni
ty He told Elizabeth all about steel and insurance and Government bonds. He
talked with one eye on Elizabeth and one on Sallie. hoping to detect in his
wife's face the latent flames of the Jealousy he had expected to kindle. But
It never appeared. Sallie didn't get jealous .worth 'a cent.' She only said: :
"I am so glad, dear, that Elizabeth is here. It gives you a chance to talk
with somebody who has sense enough to understand what you say."
But the man was not discouraged. There was one matter in which he was
particularly interested just then. He had been apprised of a prospective va
cancy in a railroad office, and, with the aid of a little pull, he hoped to get the
position. With the exception of his own aspirations, the man explained the
Bltuation to Elizabeth and she. with her acute intellect, grasped it with amazing
quickness The vacancy finally occurred and was immediately filled. The man did
not win out. He went home that night blue and but of sorts.- Sallie was smil-
"guess what has happened to Elizabeth," she said. VShe has a position. !
It Is a splendid position, too. The managers say they never employed a woman
in that capacity before, but that Elizabeth has such a wonderful mind and
shows such a perfect comprehension of the duties that they are anxious to
; give her a trial. She is very grateful to you. She says she owes it all to
your faithful coaching."
The man did not care a rap for Elizabeth just then, but he asked, with
perfunctory politeness; "What 'firm is she with?" : '\ .
"The X.Y.Z. Railroad," said Sallie. "She got that position you have
been talking:' so '-much about." . . - r -./.;" ?
â¢/Heaven above," groaned the man. "That is the last time I will ever talk
business to a woman." .. ' . \u25a0 '\u25a0\u25a0â¢'\u25a0_.â¢..\u25a0 . '

HUNTING
THE MOTOR
THERE is dismay In the ranks ot
the chauffeurs. Without any flour
ish of trumpets the edict has gone
forth that the chasse a l'automobiie, that
fascinating pastime to which the streets
of Paris have been given over for so
long, is to - cease; says the Paris corre
spondent of the . London Standard. The
hunters are to become the hunted, to be
tracked or snared or rounded up by
sleuth .", hounds of the law. specially
trained for the work. The horn will no
longer sound the joyous nqte of the pur
suers, but the mournful cry of the pur
sued. The regulations during the. maxi
mum speed of motor cars in' Paris, hith
erto a dead letter, at seven miles and a
half an hour i 3 being rigidly enforced.
And time enough, people say. even those
who have heroically risked life and limb
rafher than ask for the protection which,
they were told, "would Jeopardize the
success of a national industry." To-day 1
witnessed the holding up of half a dozen
cars. In one case the offending vehicle
was a splendid Limousine of thirty-flve
horsepower at least, containing two la
diesâby the way, in only one case of the
six which came under my notice did the
car hold other than women passengers.
This particular car had be'en stopped
while crossing the Rondpoint of the
Champs Elysees. -
A small crowd of idlers gather round
to enjoy the uncommon spectacle of the
dethronement cf the king of the road.
The chauffeur stood in the wet street and
answered the questions of a policeman
in a manner In which truculence and sur
liness were blended. Occasionally the la
dies Interpolated a shrill remark and then
lapsed into the contemplation In a mirror
of toilettes much too solidly built up to be
disturbed by Jhe shock their wearers had
suffered. The making out of a proces
verbal, always a long affair, dragged on.
The chauffeur became tired of the Jeer
ing remarks of the crowd. He gave the
horsepower of his carâ a meekly told lie â
and the mixlmum speedâ thirty kilome
ters.
Everything was goÂ»ng well until some
one said, "What? That old crock travel
thirty kilometers an hour! It couldn't do
twelve*." The words acted on the chauf
feur like the flourish of a red rag in the
face of a wounded bulL The hairs on his
! fur coat stood up like bristles, his cap
-tilted combatively. "Couldn't do twelve?"
he spluttered. "I'll bet you I can do sixty
on the third speed." He looked round, a
big boast on his lips. The policeman's
pencil was poised over his note book and
his large ears were drinking in every
word. The chauffeur saw he had been
goaded into making a mess of things, and
looked intensely foolish. The crowd
roared, and the impassive policeman la
boriously began a fresh process verbal, re
cording the premeditated making of a
false statement. I left them at this point.
DREAM PILLOW'S POWER
A "dream pillow," stuffed with feath
ers from twenty-three fowls, is one of the
treasured- effects of Mrs. Bessie Martin,
wife of "Eddie" Martin of Indianapolis,
and to' obtain it she has filed a replevin
suit against Martin G. Mock In the court
of V. T. Moore. Justice of the Peace.
Not only does she treasure it because
It is an heirloom, but because she has
slept upon It since childhood. She says
she cannot eret such restful slumbers and
refreshing sleep on any other pillow as
came to her when she rested her head on
the one which Mr. Mock keens from her.
Accordingly she asks for a judgment for
the possession of the pillow and damages
in $10. She has always used the heirloom
and says that when she uses other pillows
she is visited with bad dreams and fears
that will injure her health- . v
! The "dream pillow" was made by her
mother when a girl. The collection of
feathers is valuable, according to the
statements of Mrs. Martin. Among tho
feathers is one from "Old Abe." an eagle
which accompanied a Wisconsin regiment
through the civil war. The feathers from
each of the birds is tied separately and
labeled. Nearly all the domestic birds
are renresented. The turkey buzzard Is
omitted because it was believed its plu
mage would give rise to other than good
dreams.
Mr. Mock came Into possession of the
pillow with other household good 3 of the
Martins, when they were stored In his
place .of business early last summer.
When Mrs." Martin returned home a few
days aso. she found that the "dream
pillow" had been sold, although she says
the storage had been paid in advance.
Mr. Mock says he had no Idea that the
pillow was so- valuable.
An; attempt was made to comzÂ»romlse
the affair, but Mrs. Martin says she will
not be satisfied with anything less than
the pillow.
A WOMAN
The great love that was not for her
Passed on, nor paused to see
The wistful eyes, the hands' vague stir,
The mouth's mute misery.
The -little love she recked not of
Crept closer, bit by bit.
Until for very lack of love
She smiled and welcomed it.
Not hers to choose, to weigh and part
The -greater f rom , the less;
She only strove to fill a heart
That ached with emptiness.

THINKING
BACKWARDS
AREMARKAELE pamphlet on the
subject of retrogression of memory
or thinking backward has Just
been published by Colonel Rochas. a
former director of the Polytechnic (the
French Woolwich), who Is endeavoring to
prove the truth of the theory of reincar
nation, writes the Paris correspondent of
the London Expregs. He has hypnotized
a number cf persons and made them be
lieve they were ten, thirty and even fifty
years younger than their actual ages-
Some remarkable experiments were
made with a woman of 33 years, who was
hypnotized and to whom it was suggested
that her age was > gradually diminishes-
While in the hypnotic state she described
incidents in her life that occurred whea
she was 20. She told of her confirmation
at the age of H. and described h,er theft
of a halfpenny from her grandfather.
Gradually she lapsed Into baby language,
and at last her words became unintelligi
ble and she could only make signs.
Colonel Rochas went on with his yues
tions, and then the woman replied in the
deep voice of a man. She said her name
was Jean Bourdon and thatsh^e was a
villager. Colonel Rochas caused mqulric^
to be made and found that a marr of that
name had lived in the villags. the, woman
mentioned as far back a3 ISI2. \ After
three-quarters of an hour's further ques
tioning the woman replied In the voice at
an old woman called Carterot- .
Experiments were also made witn two
other women, and both gradually grew
more childish in mind and voice untU
they relapsed into the speech and the ac
tions of babyhood.
DIAZ, ABSOLUTE RULER
Public Opinion publishes the follow
ing account of Porflrio Diaz by Ed
ward M. Coully: "There is no more ab
solute ruler in the world to-day than
Is Porfirio Diaz, nominally President of
the Mexican republic. He has made
himself absolute ruler by his own
power, hi 3 own capacity, his own per
sonality. If the ideal government is
government by the one strong man of
his people, the man in whom is con
centrated the essence of their life, the
man who personifies the be3t that is
in them, then Mexico to-day has an ideal
government. Diaz is Mexico. He La
more. He Is one of the great men of
the world. When hl3 work Is finished
his genius will not be measured by tha
importance of Mexico, as a nation, but
by his greatness a.s a man.
The Rurales (Rural Guard) of Mex
ico have come to be nearly as well
known as the Rough Rlder3. Their or
ganization was one of the most re
markable achievements in Diaz's career.
Next to revolutions the country's great
est evil was bandits, bred naturally by
the constant state of war in the coun
try. Every highway, every mountain
trail was infested with them- Travel
was safe nowhere in the coun
try. They must be suppressed
â but how? Diaz sent for. their
leaders from all over the country. Ho
promised them safety in coming to the
capital and returning to their lairs.
The outlaws became the Rural Guard
of Mexico. They owned their
own horses and accouterments, and
they do yet. taking great pride in them.
The typical riding costume of the coun
try (charro) was adopted as their uni
form. That put an end to outlawry in
Mexico. No use for other men to start
In the business with those fellows to
run them down. The roads of Mexico
became ?afer than city streets and
traV?l as secure in the wild mountain
passes as In Pullman cars."
THE SNORER
God bless the snorer! Tha nervous
man lies awake with his thoughts,
which usually are of the remorseful
brand. What Is It about a bed that
drives a sleepless one's thoughts over
the whole range of his past, that mag
nifies bis every sin. makes him feel
a keen sense of guilt, causes him to
weaken to the point of forznin? hasty
resolutions? 13 It the bed or the hori
zontal position of the body? Perhaps
the latter has all to do with it. For no
sooner does the victim arise and as
sume the erect attitude of the biped
than his past Is veiled and ha steps out
hopefully Into his present, with a far
away peep into his future.
In my haste I said "God bless tha
snorer." After calm thought I repeat
it. The only persons who complain oj
him are those who cannot sleep. . He
sleeps. He dreams. He rests. The
world and its noises are dead to him.
No dashing 1 waves, tooting engines,
clanging" bells, booming cannon,
screeching owls, scolding tongues, bel
lowing bulls, braying Jackasses, crying
babies or cart-tall orators disturb th*
sweet serenity of his repose. H!a star
tor stands off all opposition. He rises In
the morning innocent of having caused
pain everywhere within range of . his
sonorous breathing, and starts tha new
day as fresh as the dew. â New York

LECTURES ON CIVICS
AT CALIFORNIA CLUB
Charles Zueblin of Chicago University
Visits City at Opportune Time.
Women Take Intense Interest in City's
Affairs and Set Out as Mentors. ; :
LAURA BRIDE POWERS
â¢Not since the days of Fort Qunnybags â
those busy spring â¢ days of '65â have the
obligations and rights of citizenship so
filled 'the" minds of men "as now. '
Everywhere about the cityâ even among
the little tykes of townâ are citizenship
and the things it stands for talked of
and fought over. -.
And in .the discussions the unhappy
fact is- made , plain that a .lot of men,
whom an overindulgent government has
endowed with the. right of franchise, are
either ignorant of, or indifferent to or de
fiant of their natural duties as' citizens.
As to the ignorant "citizen"â what ex
quisite irony lies in the term !â there is
hope for him, if* he be conscious of his
ignorance, and seeks the light.
As to the Indifferent, or the deliberately
defiant, their only salvation | lies in the
coming of. a great teacherâ one who can
"lead the horse to water" and smash the
adage by "making him drink." v
Such a man is now among usâ Charles
Zueblin, Ph. B. B. D., a Chicago Univers
ity man, who has devoted his mind and
his energies N to a mapping out of the
rights and duties oorf r citizenship and its
corelative estates. And he knows what
he's talking about, this Chicago Uni
versity professor, and he talks it in such
a manner that the seed sown fertilizes.
On Wednesday night he will talk upon
"The ., Twentieth Century School," illus
trating his Uecture with; slides; In] his
former taf^s; they "were illuminated by
anecdotes,, but, he. promise^ both in the
next; discourse.' "\ ; ; : ;
The/lecture is given under the auspices
of the California Clvb â a body of women
animated with a high sense of civic duty,
but prevented from expressing it at the
polls by the injustice of the constitution
of the State. The talk, and the subse
quent onesâ "The Life of a Citizen," and
"The City of the Future"â will be given
in the new clubhouse, : 1750 Clay street,
and should not be missed by any man or
woman who desires to know what a
doctor of sociology has gathered along
the lines of civics in years of observa
tion and research.
- Tickets, 50 cents for each lecture. Mea
suring by the knowledge and entertain
ment they contain, every seat In the
white and gold auditorium will be filled."
So come early! .

Now, that question has been discussed
beforeâ of timesrbeforeâ but if your mem
ory serves you well, you will remember
that the negative Is usually taken by
men.. Really, -it is they who know the
most. about it, after all. But they won't
have a chance at it on? Wednesday, and
it's an easy guess that the negative will
put up a losing fightâ because it won't
believe what it says.
The literarr and "dramatic aection of the
California Club, Mrs. Will A. Maddern
leader, is working along thoughtful and
artistic lines, following where general In
terest leads. /.
On last Thursday afternoon "Monna
Vanna," Maeterlinck's latest play, v was
given. Mme. Tojetti read a paper on the
philosophy and the symbolism of Maeter
linck's essays and, plays, while Miss Ma
bel Duffy, Arthur, Glendenning and Her
bert Lawlor of the Alcazar and Majestic
theaters rave the reading of the first
and last act of "Monna Vanna." The
reading was 'intelligently gi von, and it
would be hard to say who , scored the
honors, ' Arthur Glendenning as Guido,
Herbert Lawlor In tne part of the old
philosopher, Marco, or Miss Duffy, who
Interpreted the part or Monna with a
delicacy of feeling that bespeaks much
for the future of this young -woman.
Certainly nothing so good has ever been
given in a section meeting before, and it
is unfortunate that a programme so beau
tifully presented could not have been en
joyed by the entire club. Mrs. Maddern is
to be congratulated on the success of her
plan to interest people in the. ideas that
animate the play.
Next month Joseph Conrad's "One Day
More" will be presented, with Mrs. James
C. Crawford In charge of the afternoon.
This little play, taken from the story
"To-Morrow," was dramatized for Beer
bohm Tree and made a - big hit in Lon
don. It has not yet been produced In
America, nor Is the manuscript to be ob
tained. ;The plucky little leader was not
to be stopped by so small a matter and
proceeded to dramatize it herself. The
result is said to be something exceedingly
cleverâ which was to be expected from so
thoughtful a leader.
Porter Dies Prom Injuries.
William Mortland, the porter who
was severely jammed in an elevator at
303 Turk street on November 3, died
at the Central Emergency Hospital last

DIES FOR LOVE
OF A WOMAN
Well-Dressed Stranger Blows
Out His Brains on Bordej
of Lake in^ Southern--. Park
LEAVES PATHETIC NOTE
In Last Message Suicide
Says He Wants to Live, but
Takes Life for Sake of Girl
LOS. ANGELES, Nov. E.-"Oh. girl, I
want to live, 1 but what I do I do for love
of you, my darling."
Such was the note found on : the body
of a well-dressed man who died by. his
own \u25a0: hand on the border of ?the, s lake in
West Lake . Park. The> note was not
signed, but on other papers on the body
was found? the' name of Martin Yullwick
and that is supposed . to be ; the man's
name. Who he- was, > whence he, came,
what pathetic story there is. behind that
brief note and the tragedy which followed
the writing of it are \u25a0 matters which as
yet have not been revealed. .
Clad in fashionable attire; wearing a
large -diamond and a fine gold watch,'
with a considerable sum of money in his
pocket, the man went to the park in the
driving rain .to-night and, placing the
muzzle < of , a revolver Detween his eyes,
blew out his brains. The body waÂ» found
by persons who had heard the \u25a0 shot and
went to investigate. The man was dead
when they found him.
, The police later discovered . that the
stranger had | been rooming , at 215 Boyd
street in a cheap rooming-house, but the
proprietor ; of the place could throw no
light upon his identity. The lodging-house
keeper knew ' only, that the - man had ap
peared there' a few days ago,', paid for his
room and stated that he had just come
from the East, j He did not occupy his
room much, and conversed with nobody.
He appeared in great trouble and fre
quently paced the floor until early morn
ing hours. He had but little 'baggage,
and what there is is locked up in the ab
sence of the Coroner, who is in another
part of the county. Until the return of
that official nothing can be done.

to the surface very near, the point where
Louis yv. -Crawford and William . Howard,
who have confessed to ' disposing of i the
body, of the girl, said they dropped it from
the stern \u25a0of an Bast . Boston ferry-boat.
The head completes the body of the
girl, s The trunk was found on ' September
1 and the ' limbs on October 27. .The.leath
er bag in which the head. had been placed,
together "with thirty, pounds of loose shot,
did not . move apparently from the place
where it sank. . "
The police to-day continued the search
for Mary S. Dean, who is said ' to have
had charge of ; the: home in .which Miss
Geary died after being removed from the
Tretnont street, resort..
:'\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 Crawford and Howard .will probably re

morrow. \u25a0 â¢ â¢ ' ..

cretly.
: When asked to-night concerning the al
leged confessions of Louis W. Crawford
and William Howard, Chief Watts of the
Bureau of Criminal Investigation said:
AH I will say Is that the confession of these
two men Is the , most startling and sensational
itory I have evÂ«r heard. Ido not like to think
of . It. . It Is % a terrible story and the moat
remarkable I think â¢in , all that I ha.vÂ« heard
of In all my, years of police service.
, Tho prisoners, Morris Nathan, who was
brought here from Pittaburg, and Dr.
Percy D. McLeod, who was arrested in
Boston on Friday, are all charged -with
the same crime.
THINKS CRIME
IS ONLY JOKE

TACOMA, Nov. B.â Myrtle Tlpton, the
eighteen-year-old girl horsethief, has
gone to the penitentiary from Coif ax to
serve -/ a . term I. of two years. '._ She .went
smiling and; Joking with those about the
Sheriff's office. She expresed herself de
lighted with the shortness of her sentence
for she had . expected to get ten years.
is pleased with the notoriety she has'
gained and when shown ; the papers . con
taining: her picutre she seemed flattered.
The. girl seems utterly oblivious to the
enormity of her offense and appears to
think she has . played * a practical joke
which , furnishes her much amusement.
An older sister. Miss Tlpton, of Walla
Walla, visited Myrtle An< Jail >and wept
bitterly when she saw her sister in the
County Prison, a \ condemned felon, but
Myrtle smiled and said, ;"l'm just tickled
to death It was not ten years."
Miss " TtDton told some of the family
history which shows that Myrtle Inherits
at least a portion of her criminal dispo
sition.

WIND PUZZLES
THE MARKSMEN
They Find It Difficult to
Adjust Rifle Sights to
Meet Varying Conditions
â¢
The conditions were bad for the marks
men who gathered at Schuetzen Park
yesterday for the purpose of rolling up
a. good score nearing the end of the year.
The strong north wind that prevailed
was constantly shifting, now east, now
wÂ«t, and kept the ritiemen busy in an
effort to adjust their sights to the vary
ing: crmrJitiÂ«jns of- the atmosphere. - â
The California Schuetzen Club, Grutli
and Kintracht clubs had a large number
of members . on the range, but despite
their best efforts no large scores were
made. . '.
A. Strecker. the well-known champion,
â¢was high man in the California Club with
217 rings to his credit, being followed by
Otto Bremer with -US and G. M. Barley,
who sccred 21Â£. . . - 'â¢-
A. Gehret carried off the champion
honors !-â¢>. the Grutli Club and won the
class medal with a score of 213 and 214
rings. The socond champion medal was
captured by George R. Hauser asith 19S.
The highest score in the Eintracht Club
was made by F. Eggeling with 323 rings,
who won the first class medal.
* The pistol shooters of the California
Schuetzen Club found it hard to hold
, against the wind and did not come up
to their usual average. G. M. Barley,
with SS and 69 rings, was the leader in
This event, his closest competitor being
W. F. Blasse with 72 and 83. The scores:

Until the Pren^nt Role* Are
Amended by the Official*.
Tho students of St. John's Athletic
Association at Manllus. N. V.. seek to
change the conditions In .preparatory
school football. They have sent
broadcast the following circular:
We believe the only thing that will clean up
th* gam* of football will \u25a0 be for all prep.
fchoolp. academies and high - achools to refuse
to play Ict a year or co. This will compel the
football authorities to radically change the
nil*"*.
Will ycu sot advocate each a revolutionary
ir-ovenr-nt m all schools In your field of influ
ence?
Such a tidal wave should bring the sweep
ing changes needed. We have adopted the foi
lowlmr:
Rcsoived. That we. the students of Saint
John's School at Maulhis. drop the game of
lootball after playing out the season, except
&mcnjr ourselves ca our own grounds.
That football a* It ie now played is more
for college than for prep, school;
That professionalism ani take scholarships
are largely resjoneible ror the unnecessary
roughness. Ehiirging and demoralizing influ
ence* of an otherwise node game;
That wÂ« Indorse Pres:oent Roosevelt's ef
forts to cleanse the game.

menced last Sunday, was completed. Mel
ville Long won the event with surprising
ease. "

noon.
Although playing from 30 behind scratch
Melville Long won ; the California Club
event without losing a set. In the semi
finals and finals he disposed of his op

the match went to Long in three straight
sets, none of which was close. The score
was 6-1, 6-2. 6-2.
In the semi-finals v Long met Harold

was 6-2. 6-3. 7 v ; ;
In the third round Albert Kenyon al
lowed William Murphy odds of 15 3-6 and
owe 15 and won by a score of 6-4, 6-4.

NEW ORIiEANS, Nov. s.â Unless the
Western Jocljey.' Club and the American
Turf Association effect an amicable set
tlement of their troubles and avert the
impending turf war which is scheduled
to begin in New Orleans when the Fair
Grounds and the City Park tracks begin
their annual winter racing on the 30th
inst.; a bill will probably be introduced at
the forthcoming session of the Legisla
ture to prohibit horseraclng in Louisiana.
Lieutenant Governor ' Sanders has pre
pared an anti-racins measure with the
understanding that lf the turf war is
not averted he will use his influence to
have the bill adopted. Public ; sentiment
is strong against racing and the leading
ministers are taking an active part in the
crusade to have it stopped or at least
restricted.

The Seals are the rushing kids just
now. They went through the Tigers
four times without falling down once
and yesterday afternoon trotted off. the
field at Recreation Park with the series
safely tucked under their -belts. J They
played clever ball and that whelped
some, but the rough work of the Tigers
figured more and it was on that account
the tables turned as they did.
Bobby Keefe lost his fourth'game in
three seasons. It was hardly ms fault,
for he pitched good ball. His fielders
were never there when the Seals look
ed dangerous and the : four runs that
came through were gathered easily.,
Hltt was his usual self. Not quite as
effective as he sometimes is, but :that
he provedthe mystifying kid with men
on the paths. Five double plays were
reeled off and as the Seals made four of
these, they counted a whole lot and
helped keep men away from that pan
when they seemed destined to cross it
under the least provocation. \
The Tigers started the scoring in the
second when Eagan bit off a hit and
McLaughlin sprinted .fast enough to
beat one, to first. ] Lynch bunted both
along and Casey worked the squeeze
play so successfully that Truck arrived
with the big run.
The Seals were ready^and willing to
mix it at all times. In the third Mohler
worked Keefe for a pas 3 and Hilde was
hit jy the pitcher. ..Wheeler got a
scratchy one and the bags were all oc
cupied. Householder had nothing bet
ter than ah infield fly. Keefe lost his
nerve after putting Eddie away and
walked *Irwin, forcing Hilde home.
Hitt started something for Uncle by
poking out a safe one in the fourth.
Mohler again got a four-spot and Mike
Lynch was gracious enough to drop
Hilde' s fly so that Hitt arrived without
much effort. Irwin was there with the
big two-bagger over third. In- the fifth
and started to steal third. Hogan
winged the ball over Sheehan's head
and Charley breezed "to the plate with
another for the Harris Torces. .
The Tigers gathered one more in the
seventh just.: to show they \ were still
playing- the game, but they did not
have a chance after that and all was
over quickly. The score: "

terday and after a few hours' stay left
for Nashville, where the next meeting
of the American Turf Association begins

Bush-Cella syndicate, representins tha
Western Jockey Clyb.
"I have resigned from the active man
agement of the New Orleans Jockey Club,
much against the wishes of President
Htaslip. Mr. Rhynock and tha rest of my
associates," he said. "I have worked hard
for a year and need a rest. We have our
affairs In. such shape now that they can
run themselves. With such men as Heas
lip, Murphy. Trevelyan, Kuhl, Rhynock.
Respess and Batens on the ground and
working in unison there is absolutely no
reason why I should be kept in harness.
After the holidays I shall go to Califor

eight weeks there. I have some good;
brood mares and yearlings that need look

SAN RAFAEU Nov. 5. â The practice
shoot of Companies B and C of the
First Battalion of Artillery, National
Guard of California, generally known
as the Nationals, was held to-day on
the. San Rafael State range. Their
regular range at Glen Park has no
500-yard target and they were assigned
the use of this range for to-day and
for Sunday, the 26th lna,t. Considering
their unfamillarity with the range ami
the prevailing north wind striking the
range at right angles, they made gooÂ«i
scores. Many of the marksmen prefer
the range to the Glen Park range.
Under the new law of the National
Guard the best two scores of each man
on each target shoot between May 1
and December 1 of this year will b*Â»
the score for the year and their marks
manship will be figured on this. Fol
lowing are the best scores made over
the different ranges: ,- . .

HAS A SEQUEL
Bodies of Eugene Brunei and

Alter a Week's Searching
HUNTEKS ABE DROWNED
Two Who Duck Shoot
ing iii Small Boat Meet
Death After a Struggle
The uncertainty as to the fate of Eu-;
jrene Brunei, a boy, and John . Lerabeye,
who started on a hunting trip on the bay
on October "9, has been removed. â¢ Their
bodies were found yesterday floating in
the southern part of "yie fcay.
A little water spaniel which had been
on the trip with them was found Monday
marooned on a rock about a mile from
Hunters Point. The boat was floating,
bottom up, not far from the rock. The
little animal was nearly dead from ex
posure when it was picked up.
The body of Brunei was found off | the
Risdon Iron Works by Ernest . Kroning
and George Brannan" of the revenue cut
ter Manning.' Jules Brunei, a brother of
the .dead boy, identified the remains. .
JCembeye's body was ' carried. la>a dif
ferent . direction by the shifting tides.. It
was found near the. drydock- at Hunters
Point by Thomas Beall j and I H. i Hines.
The body was Identified by Alex Clevere,
an uncle, of the dead .man. The remains
of both were badly decomposed! .
It is supposed that the boat- capsized
when the hunters were some' distance off
shore. Both men were able to- swim; but
the bay was 'rough and they were far
from the shore.. â¢\u25a0 "'\u25a0?.\u25a0 .:*
'lt is supposed that they struggled des
perately, against the heavy seas until they
became weaker . and weaker and ' finally
sank. The' dog â¢ evidently had greater
powers of endurance,- for he was able to
reach the rock. :' \ '
Even after the dog had been found, the
relatives of both men still cherished
hopes that they would turn up,.' Air their
hopes in. this direction were blasted yes
terday. , .-'. : L ' . \u25a0
Lembeye was 30 years old and a laundry
worker by trade. He leaves a widow.
Brunei was /only 17. He has-been em
ployed as a clerk.

TELLS TALE

Louis /Herman Gives Graphic
Account of How He Found
Yellow Dust on Beach
of Popoff Island, Alaska
STAKES CLAIMS THAT
MAY YIELD % FOETUNE
Lihajiitarits of /the Country
Fail to Pay Au^Aitention
to the Miner as He Digs
and Washes Along Shore
,;LJke a modern Croesus,' Louis Herman,
a miner and hunter, who has traversed
the icy domain of the land of the
night sun. dropped In on the water, front
last night and astounded many an eager
listener with his story of fabulous wealth
that lies hidden on the beach of Popoff
Island, Western Alaska,
Herman, according to] his statements,
has mined and hunted all over the vast
Alaskan territory. He has' visited many
a mining camp in his day and seen the
wealth being extracted from the bowels
of the earth. But not till the spring of
1904 has .'he -ever encountered such great
wealth as was his fortune to locate In a
district where: no living i soul ever
dreamed there Were the, richest of dig
gings. . . i â¢ â¢ :
Herman is a man of intelligence an<i
not given to wasting words ' in the tale
he unfolds of , his great discovery. He
was very reticent regarding his .experi
ence oil the Popoff beach and it took
great urging before he would consent to
narrate his story. In order to make it
convincing, Herman produced a ' small
bottle filled with pure gold dust which
he said he secured on the Popoff beach
with very, small exertion.
Herman said he had been prospecting all
along the coast for years^ and. casually
strolled along the beach of" Popoff Island
one day when he noticed signs of gold on
the beach. This at once started him
looking further and In a short time he
managed to pick up gold enough to make
a tenderfoot miner think he was a real
millionaire. /
Herman kept his discovery to himself
and continued prospecting. He panned
and wasned away and met with good suc
cess. He says his day's work averaged
from 515 to $25 and that the gold was to
be had in good quantities all along the
beach. He finally got tired of the dig
gings there and wandered farther inland,
where he says he made discoveries that
will prove to be wealthy far beyond the
placers of the Klondike.
The miner says he could, not stakÂ« the
beach claims, but he quickly took up all
the available land along the shore, * and
this he expects will put him on an equal
footing with J.Pierpont. Morgan! No
body: helped him In nls work and JiÂ© has
no prontsVtoshare with any: one.'and all
the claims, are in his; own name. ?â¢'; ::\u25a0'.':
Herman avers that*. when 'he first
made his discovery; he went ; to 'a store
keeper in the vicinity named Scott and
asked for a magnet. /The , shopman
handed it out and : did â¢ riot even ask
Avhat Herman wanted it; for. When it
was returned the storekeeper I simply
took it and never went to the trouble of
asking Herman what he had been doing
on the beach. The people seem, in
different to' the yellow metal/ \u25a0
According to Herman, the gold on
the surface of the beach Is ' of high
grade. He believes there is greater
wealth still In the quartz claims back
of the beach. Herman' thinks this will
run enormously high, | though :he â¢ has
not assayed it yet and j therefore cannot
determine its true .value. . ' .' ;
Judging from* his manner, and speech,
Herman Is : a practical â¢ miner and ; a j man
who has had much" experience in seeking
the precious metal in the .region of ice
and snow. , He says he roamed around
Alaska for twenty years and during
that time was out of the country"only
once, when he came here about five years
ago. \u25a0' '\u0084 : ' \u0084 -' - .- -,' *
He claims to have been one of the first
men on the. famous Nome' beach .when
gold' was. discovered' there ., in 1901. He
mined : there for a while and Uheri drifted
away again,- hunting, and" prospecting in
various parts of the country. He says
he will return to Popoff , Island In about
a month to work on his claims.

Officers at the City Prison
Have Desperate Struggle
With Powerful Coal Miner
SENT TO THE HOSPITAL
Friends Say He Had to Leave ;
Tesla About a Week Ago j
Because Life Was in Danger
-Thomas J. "Vitaioh, a young ; ooal
miner, became violently insane in a cell
at the, City Prison shortly after the
noon hour .yesterday. He was put- in
the dark cell, but his shouts became so
annoying that Policeman P. H. Murphy
opened the cell - door to remonstrate^
with him. Murphy found that Vitaich
had divested himself of; his clothes and
had been trying- to pin an Eagle badge
on his bare breast, causing blood to
flow.
Vitaich is ; a powerfully .built man,
and as Murphy opened the door v he
sprang at him and a desperate struggle
followed. Policeman John J. Coughlin,
Sergeant Melody and some of the "trus
ties*!, ran to Murphy's assistance, but It
took considerable time before .they
could overpower the maniac and hand
cuff him. Flrmin "Tridoy, one of the
"trusties," was -kicked in the abdomen
and rendered senseless. -Vitaich ; was
taken to the ' Insane ward at the Cen
tral Emergency. Hospital by Policemen
Walsh." Silver, and Engel.
Vitaich was arrested shortly after S
'o'clock- yesterday morning on Stanyan
street by Policeman Kerrison on com
plaint of Louis Cohan, a chauffeur, for
refusing to pay. hire for an automobile.
He was taken to. the Golden Gate Park_
station and was later removed to -the
City Prison. .
After lie had been taken to the hos
pital, two of Vitaich's friends called
at .the prison and said that he had been
employed as a miner at Tesla, Alameda
County, tillabout a week ago. He was
considered: the strongest man of the
five hundred; employed at the mines,
and had beaten bo many Italians who
had provoked l him to fight that they
had combined to kill him. His friends
had advised him to leave the place in
view of the threats to kill him, and
about a week. ago. 'he came to the city
with his wife and child and had been
living in a lodging house on Fifth
street. . They had^ noticed a change in
his mental condition for some time and
believed that ' his arrest had brought
on the. crisis. <

CLEVER MINSTREL j
PLAYS AT ORPHEUMJ
Edwin Latell Best of Excel-!
lent Bill at Vaudeville j
House. i
Edward Latell, minstrel, won first
place in the hearts of Orpheum lovers
last night. He played 'first on the banjo \
and then \u25a0 pounded upon old-fashioned
sleigh bells, and the audience roared its |
enthusiastic approbation. Coupled with J
his. musical genius Latell has a fine line i
of running talk, and although soma "of
his jokes carried one back to the days of
1848, he covered their age so deftly that
he never failed to get a laugh from his â¢
hearers. His burlesques and imitations ;
were equally clever, and at the end of his j
act he was called before the curtain many i
times. '
Emma Francis and her Arabian dancers
in their mazy whirls about the stage were
given a rousing reception. Next in favor j
were Jane Melville and Evie â¢ Stetson, ,
comediennes, who . burlesqued verious !
kinds of Bowery . entertainment. Anton [
and Henry Elgona raised rough-house in !
their acrobatic feats on a see-saw. j
Of the . old numbers Prelle's animals I
vied with the Macarte sisters for popular I
favor. The animals are Intelligent arid j
novel in .their circus act. The Macarte
sisters do wonderful things In their aerial
flights. "Another Cucumber," the only
9ketch of the evening, was again in favor,
and . Signorina Verera, from Italy, singer,
earned much applause. The motion pict
ures ended the bill.
