Indians^ mere killed and as many more
â¢everely Injured this afternoon in a land
~frÂ£e which occurred near Spences Bridge,
efcout 100 miles from Vancouver. The top
cf a. mountain came down with : a rush
more than two thousand feet and wiped

curred â¢within half a mile of the town of
Spences Bridge on the line of t the Ca

ca the opposite side of the Thompson RlvÂ£
er from the railroad track and the point
it occurred is plainly visible from
the car windows.
The Indian village was nestled in a lit
tle fiat at the foot of the mountain.' There
v,Â«re thirty houses in the place, which
â¢was one of the oldest inÂ»this part of the
upper country.
Juft after three o'clock- there was a
rumblÂ« from the mountainside and three
minutes Jater It was all over. . Great rocks
Â«id trees wer* carried down and , over
whelmed the tiny houses of the Indians.
A Jew of the natives ran down along the
river when they saw the slide, approach -
Ing. but not more than seven or eight got
away. Others were caught at the extreme
edges and got off .with ' .comparatively
Blight bruises.
Half an hour after the catastrophe oc

CHRISTIANIA, Aug. v 13.â The NOr
,wegian people, In a referendum vote
taken to-day, pronounced in favor of the
dissolution \u25a0of the union with Sweden
with remarkable though not unexpected
unanimity. Of 450,000 voters 330,000 cast
ballots. While .the. full result will not
be known for some hours, up to mid
night returns show that about one per
son in three thousand voted against the
dissolution. The difference between the
total number of voters and the uumber
of votes cast is attributable to absentees,
such as sailors abroad and others who
are out" of the country at present. .
There were scenes of the greatest en
thusiasm everywhere. Thousands of
â¢women, who , did . not ' have ..the right : of
franchise, signed petitions in the streets,
indorsing the dissolution. . In Christiania
aud other cities the total â¢': population
turned out," every one wcarinff. long
streamers of the national colors and por
traits of Premier Michelsen.
One of the members' of the Cabinet said
tornight: ; , , - . .
"The result surpasses the most san
guine expectations. The next : official
steps will, be: taken after the. Storthing
meets . on August 21, when- the - result . of
the plebescite will . be communicated . to.
Sweden, through the Swedish Cabinet and
the' Riksdag.' The Storthing will .repeat
the request that the Riksdag declare the
union dissolved. The Storthing will also
express a willingness to negotiate con
cerning the details of the dissolution. It
Is thp earnest desire of Norway to con
clude the dissolution "amicably. . Nor
way will never "retract, but everything
will be. done to meet - the. wishes of
Sweden in other directions. If peace de
pends upon abolishing the forts, theyrwill
be abolished.: . â¢
-^'Norway must; remain a monarchy; the
people do not desire a republic." ;", '
At midnight reports from 178 places
show a vote 0f. 05,925 for and 37 against

Major Taggart's counsel claim that It
has been shown that Mrs. Taggart was
guilty with Lieutenant Rlther. Clinton K.
Speencer. Lieutenant Granville B. Fos
tescue. General- C. A. Miner, Captain
Louis Bash" and William Taggart of Oro
ville; also that she was guilty of cruelty
in having her husband arrested on a false
charge and placed in prison: that she
abandoned him when she Relieved he was
on his deathbed: that she associated with
persons to whom he objected: that
Sat she, smoked cigarettes, tod v c
that she. smoked ticarettes. told vile
stories, drank whisky and beer in the
Presence o\ her children and gave beer to
the. boys.
"WASHINGTON. Aug. 13.-Several
courts-martial will certainly grow out of
the Taggart divorce proceedings In view
of the charges of drunkenness mads
against his brother officers by Major Tag
gart when on the stand last week. Un
less the officers involved request that
courts of inquiry make Investigations re
garding the charges President Roosevelt
will order an inquiry into conditions . ex
isting in; the array, especially in relation
to those officers who drink intoxicating
liquors to excess.
â¢ The testimony of Taggart has caused
quite a sensation in army circles, and
many officers 'take the ground that. In
justice to them, the President should or
der an" Investigation for" the purpose" of
disclosing; how, extensive the habit 'of
drinking : to .excess prevails in the army
and whether, or not this practice Is re
sponsible i: for . conduct :. unbecoming of
ficers and - gentlemen ."on '. the ; part" of of
ficersifot^the army. ; AS. Â»", matter/ of .pro

testimony/ of " Major Taggart. ;He has
.testified, underf oath that a number of
"army "officers." whose, names he gave, were
guilty of drunkenness . and of ungentle
manly conduct. Under the regulations It
isthe right and duty of.an officer when
charges -of , this kind are made against
him- to demand a" court of Inquiry, and if
he'does not any other officer of the oei>
vice /who witnesses conduct which was
to the detriment of * the service" is re
quired to call the matter to the attention
of the department with the view of order
ing a court-xnartlal.
In the. absence of such request from
the -officer directly involved or from those
who : witnessed infractions of the rules
and regulations, the President or Secre
tary of .War generally orders an investi
gation. This probably will be the course
pursued in the Tajygart case. â¢
WOOSTEK. Aug. 13.â Major Taggart
will be on the stand when* the taking of
evidence is resumed to-morrow to the di
vorce proceedings. Counsel on both sides
seem to agree that the trial Trill take at
least ten days longer : and that the de
fense will not be heani before Thursday.
That General Charley A. Miner, retired,
will be here is said to be certain. When
he- goes' oh the stand some sensational
testimony will be given as to the alleged
habits, of Taggart and as to the charges
on which Taggart was held in prison at
Fort Leavenworth. Some family secret 3
also will come to light In showing what
Mr<' 'Taggart did for the brothers of
Major Taggart when they were in trou

ing the- more or less definite announce
ment which has, emanated from various
sources during the last few months. Con
gress ._ may not be called Into extraor
dinary session " next November. Indeed.
\u25a0 the Indications are now that no extraor
dinary session win be held this year. This
statement Is made on the authority ot
President Roosevelt himself. He has not
decided definitely, and will probably not
reach a determination of it until he shall
have ; returned to Washington the latter
part " of September. - The chances ot an
extraordinary - session- appear, however,
to be fading.
Strong pressure Is being brought to bear
upon the President |to j induce him. not to>
call an extra session. So mud) Interest
has beÂ«n - manifested In the â¢ subject
throughout the country that the Presi
dent has received a large number of let
ters regarding It. Many Senators and
Representatives have urged against an
extra session. They point out that prac
tically nothing will be gained by an ex
, tra session that will begin not more than
three weeks before the opening of thÂ«
regular long session, and in addition It
1 would causa "some Inconvenience to many
members of Congress in both branches-
Taking these things Into consideration,
, the.' President has reserved a deonite de
cision of the matter, the chances* as
noted,. being that the session will not b*
called. V"
, PRESIDENT'S FIRST PLANS.
Last. spring It was the President's idea
to issue at the proper time a. call for an
extraordinary session of Congress, to be
held in October, for the purpose of enact
ing If possible railroad rate legislation.
Incidentally It was expected that
recommendations might be- made. by- the
President regarding proposed changes In
the existing tariff law.
-The Idea Â©I an October session -finally
was abandoned, and subsequently the
President made arrangements for a two
weeks' trlpÂ» through the South, beginning
October 17. It was then announced that
the proposed ; extraordinary session would
not â¢be held until after the November
elections...-!-. .- -;- â¢ â¢ â¢ \u25a0\u25a0..\u25a0...
If, -finally, - the President should \ decida
to call Congress together the seslon .will
begin on the .first Monday- after the -No
vember ejections, which. will be j-nst. thr^e
weeks .before the beginning of' thÂ« regular
session In December. . : . â¢ ;.-.;-:.\..-s-v.
. In this connection it can be \u25a0 said to be
not unlikely, In view of the prevalence of
yellow fevÂ«r In New Orleans, that. the
President; may conclude to: make bis trip
through . the South in two sections, visiting
the Atlantic Coast. States In October and
Louisiana,' Arkansas and .perhaps 'Ten
nessee on another trip, to be made later.
No . definite .-.- arrangements to this end
have been completed, but the matter is
being considered. .< â¢- ... rv.ivl.

of the chief reasons advanced .by Count

President Caniff of the Nickel Plate to
day stated that from the information in
the hands of the officials the freight crew
had orders to go on the siding at Kish
man and there await the passage of the
passenger train. Why this was not done
in time to permit the passenger train to
go by or a flagman sent out has not yet
been learned. A rigid investigation is be
ing made by the railroad officials. It is
said that the watch of the engineer of the
freight train was slow and that the en
gineer believed he had eight minutes to
get his train on the siding before the pas
sett ger train was due. The freight train
had slackened speed and was about to
back in on the siding from the main track
when the passenger train came tearing
along at the rate of forty-five miles an
hour and dashed Into it.
The injured were hurried to Loralne
and placed in. the hospital. The dead
were conveyed to the morgue at. Loralne.;
When the trains cume together almost
everybody in the smoker was. dozing. The
sudden jar hurled them "out of their 6eats
Into the aisle and threw several persons
to the roof and sides of the car, which all
at once crushed in like a paper bag, pin
ning down the passengers. The passen
gers in the second car were more fortu-*
nate. There the violence of the impact*
was not so severe, although few got oft*
without cuts, bruise?, sprains or broken
bones. The two rear cars, - sleepers, with
stood the shock. ;No passengers in the
sleepers were injured.
The men on the train "who escaped In
jury worked hard to rescue the victims,
end were aided by residents from the
vicinity of the wreck. Some of the in
jured were placed in the 6leeplng-cars,
While others were moved to houses near
the siding. %
The injured included the following:
John W. Long, Cleveland ; Richard A-
Long, son of J. W. Long; Mrs. John W.
Long; Louis Reihnbold, Bascom, OhioL
E. E. O'Hara, Findlay. Ohio; B. L. Kerr.

\u25a0Haven. Conn.; Philip Baskim. Tiffin.
Ohio; Floyd Trumer, Ada. Ohio; John
Dedtout, Tiffin. Ohio; Frank Phillips,
Findlay. Ohio.
Aside from the engineer the men killed
on the passenger train were all riding In
the smoking-car and were mostly foreign
laborers In the employ of the Standard
Oil Company, on their way from Fort
fieneca, Ohio, to Brookfield, Ohio, in
charge cf a foreman.
Engineer C. C. Poole of the passenger
train was killed while trying to reach for
the air brake. Ills fireman, Haefner,
caved himself by jumping. The high
epeed of the passenger train threw its
locomotive and first three coaches over
en the engine of the freight train, tele
ecopirig the smoker and the car follow
ing. Several cars of the freight -train
were splintered to fragments. 1 '
Of the passengers in the smoker none
escaped injury. Fortunately there was
co fire, but the heavy timbers of the
wrecked cars pinned down many and pre
vented them getting out until assistance
arrived. Doctors were sent on" a special
train from Loralne.

KOMURA ANSWERS ADVERSARY.
To this argument Baron Komura dis
sented most vigorously, although in the
most friendly manner, contending that
Japan only to secure for herself
in Korea the commercial and industrial
positions to which she was entitled and
to aid in its civilization and develop
ment, as well as to protect' the kingdom
from administrative anarchy. - .'
The fact that the Korean question
should be the lirst to be discussed in
the peace conference is strangely fit
ting, as it was over Korea that the
long struggle ' between ' Russia and
Japan, which culminated' in the present
bloody war, began. After Japan was
forced out of Port Arthur and Liaotutig
in 1895, each became suspicious of the
intention ' of the other's influence in
Korea, and, first in the Lobaiioff agree
ment or 189 C and later in tho
Nlssi-rtoscn agreement of ISOS,
they entered upon mutual obli
gations. In the former Japan
secured the right to protect, the im
perial family and to build tho Seoul-
Fusan telegraph and: Russia to~ estab
lish telegraph lines from Seoul to the
Russian frontier. In the latter, while
there were mutual obligations to pro
tect the independence and territorial in
tegrity of Korea, Japan's industrial
and commercial position in Korea was
recognized. Ever since Korea has been
the bone of contention, Japan . has al
ways been suspicious of Russian en
croachment. At last thÂ« continued oc
cupation of Manchuria- by Russia and'
the. Yalu lumber concessions induced"
Japan to try to come to Fa definite, sot
tlement with Russia in > the negotia
tions preceding the war. These proved
futile and in tho Japanese imperial.re
script declaring war the Emperor of
Japan said: .
"Russia has no objection, to . Japan
taking Korea, but you must nvow it
plainly. If it is to be taken, it should
be taken officially, so that the .world
will understand your purpose to, take
possession of the persons of the entire
administration, of the kingdom, from
the Emperor down to the smallest of
the people. Korea will have no repre
sentative abroad who can explain the
situation from the standpoint of the
Koreans. All of which means that
Korea is to belong to Japan. So be it.
Russia will not object, but Japan should
avow a purpose which is against the
interests of Europe and America and
especially against, the ;â¢ interests of the
United States, China ana" even of your
ally, England. If this is satisfactory
to you and America, Russia raises" no
protest. You propose to destroy every
vestige of the sovereignty of the Em
peror of Korea, but you desire to em
ploy a formula which will conceal your
true purpose. The country which will
suffer most is America, which will un
derstand it in about ten years, when
it is too late." : si*-v'f '
f M,. de -Wltte made no objection, but
he -declared the words "preponderating
influence" did not adequately describe
what Japan, proposed, to do, and he in-,
eisted. that the language used should
show Japan's trueVpurpose.V-whlch, he
contended, was to make a Japanese
province .of Korea. His argument
might be summarized, as follows: V
An intimation comes from a high
source that very strong outside in
fluences are at work on both sides and
that for the moment the effort is to
gain time. The plan of having Russia
practically satisfy Japan's claim of re-,
imbursement for the cost ; of .. the war
by the purchase of the. Japanese mili
tary evacuation of. Saghalien continues"
to be advanced. Such a solution would
permit Russia to say she . haH neither,
paid indemnity nor ceded a foot of ter
ritory.
The debate- in yesterday's conference
over the first condition â the recogni
tion of Japan's "preponderating influ
ence" over Korea, involving her right
to control the administration of the
Hermit Kingdom, was the littoral for
strategic purposes, etc. â was of a re
markable character. Jndeed. the posi
tion taken by M. de'Witte was sensa
tional in the- extrefue. His attitude re-.
veals plainly the Russian tactics. They
propose to raise before the world tho
specter of the "yellow peril." Russia
claims that Japan's present purpose tis
to get foothold on the Asiatic continent,'
from which to. extend her. dominion.
DE , WITTE'S feeiXS ATIOJVAL SPEECH.
The principal reason for optimism
lies in the fact that, confronted with
the absolute refusal of the Russian re-i
ply to admit the discussion of either
indemnity or the cession of. the island'
of Saghalien, the Japanese proposed to.
take up the consideration of the con-,
ditions seriatim. From this it Is as
sumed that the Japanese are prepared,
to yield or have reason to believe a way.
will be found to overcome the objec
tions of their adversaries when the.
crucial test comes.

progress has been maae with the peace
negotiations over Sunday. They stand
exactly where they did last night. The
session of tie plenipotentiaries which ;
was to have been held this afternoon,
was postponed by mutual consent, ouf
of reverence for â¢ the Holy Sabbath,
which is universally observed in Russia
as a day of rest. : j
The Russians had hot been anxious
for a session to-day and this morning i
the Japanese took tbe"i/iltlative, and,
through the intermediary of Mr. Peirce.
it was decided to postpone the sitting
until to-morrow morning. The situa- j
tion. thereSgr?, remains the same.. It
would, perhaps, not be too much to say
that the general feeling is more hope-
ful.- in spite of open predictions made
by personages connected with both
sides of; the negotiations that before
next^Sunday the plenipotentiaries .will
have reached an. impasse where a rup
ture will become Inevitable. This pes
simistic view, is based upon the fact
that, so far as. known, the two big
barriers to an ; agreementâ indemnity
and Saghallen â remain "as high and in- j
surmountable as ever. . \u25a0\u25a0 . .

No joy or pleasure on this earth quite
equals that which comes into the home
when baby arrives. Who can describe
the happiness of man and woman, joined
in wedlock, as they look upon the fragile,
delicate mite thatis blood of their blood
end flesh of their flesh? And who can
depict the hopelessness and dejection
that hover about the home where the
wife is incapable of becoming a mother?
Barrenness proceeds from some derange-
ment of the distinctly feminine organs.
Llany of the common ailments known as
"female troubles" cause it. Dr. Pierces
Favorite Prescription overcomes barren-
ness by stamping out diseases of- women,
and by healing and curing ulceration. It
tones up the system, stops drains, and
restores strength. During gestation it
modifies morning sickness, gives elastic-
ity to the overstrained parts concerned,
makes the hour of baby's coming short
and almost painless, and gives wonderful
recuperative power to the patient. By
p:aking the mother strong and cheerful,,
it makes the little one healthy, vigorous
and good naturedr Insist upon the med-
icine dealer giving you Dr. Pierces Fa-
vorite Prescription when you ask for it.
Substitutes are often dangerous..

In Jerome the saloons employed non
union men and as a consequence the
Miners' Union declared a boycott. This
was so completely carried out that it
put gambling out of business. When it
was found that the men, had saved
thousands of dollars thereby it was
agreed to continue the good work. To
day there is but one game. running in
the big copper city.
At Seligman, where a few^ months ago
saloons were employing a number, of
men each and games were receiving
considerable patronage, the owners are
now doing their own work and the
games are closed. This state of affairs
was brought about by the defalcation
of an agent of the Santa Fe Railroad,
who afterward committed suicide * ; in
this city. The money was lost over the
gaming tables In Seligman and as a re
sult any railroad man caught patroniz
ing these places Is summarily dis
charged.
In Douglas, where things are sup
posed to be wild and,? woolly, the dive
saloons are to be suppressed. Follow
ing this up an effort is to be made In
all incorporated towns to limit the
number of saloons and place them un
der police regulations.
PHOEXIX. A. T.. Aug. 13.â A wave of
reform is spreading over Arizona.
Many of the county Boards of Super

it a misdemeanor for any saloon to con

- v The Hercules Gas Engine Works. 215
to 231 Bay street, were destroyed by fire
yesterday morning. The blaze was start
ed by an explosion in the testing room,
the cause of which nobody knows. In
a few minutes the big wooden building
was a mass of flames. Had it not been
for a substantial fire wall nearly 100 peo
ple sleeping in tenements in the rear of
the works, would have been burned to
death in their beds.
The works were full of oils and other
lnfla:^Â«a.ble material and the flames dart
ed out 9^Â«rr '^z vra.Us, scorching the rear
of the tcnCnÂ«tits. Awakened by the clang
ing fireb2ii*. nisn. women and children
rushed to the street in terror. The lire
burned from 4:30 in the mornins until
nearly noon.
The fi>e Â£?;?artment did valiant ser
vice. All the buildings in the vicinity
ivere of wood and adjacent to the engine
works was the Mendoclno Coal Yard. A
stiff breeze threatened to spread the fire
siid wipe out the eastern section of North
Beach. Only the dogged perseverance
of the firemen prevented this.
Four children of Jacob Mass. 320 C
Francisco street, had p. narrow escape.
"They were sleeping in a room directly in
the rear of the testing room, where the
first cxr>losion occurred.
A crashing report awoke them and the
flames blinded them. In terror they
scrambled out of their beds and rushed '<
Into the str*et. Barefooted and scantily
clad iittie George Maas rushed to the
lire house at Stockton and Francisco
streets and turned in the alarm. Then
little Ella, aged S. remembered that her
dollie was in the lire, being "all burned
up." Before anybody could stop her, she
rushed back into the house.
The room which the children had left
"was as hot as an oven and already the
curtains were blazing. But little' Ella
*as determined that her dollie must be
Fayed. While her brothers and sisters
were wailing in the street, she stumbled
through the smoke and found the dollie.
Her hair and eyebrows were singed by
the heat and she was all exhausted when
she reached the street.
Ella's father achieved. a feat almost as
hazardous. He had a number of pet
oenary birds in the hous<\ which the chil
k aren b*ggÂ«*J him to save. He yi?lded to
their entreaties and rushed in after them.
He secured the cages, but the birds had
been suffocated.
Oliver Jones, the watchman, who slept
in the engine works, was awakened by
the explosion. He first ran to the stables
of the Mendocino Coal Company, where
a magnificent pair < f Mack horses were
hous-ed. He tried to force the door open
to let them es< ape. but a jet of flame
from the i?>sting-room scorched his handb
and face and he was driven into the
street, blinded and in terrible pain. The
horses, penned in their stalls, were slow
ly roasted to death despite the heroic ef
forts of the firemen to reach them. Their
cr'es chilled the hearts of listeners and
could be heard for some time above the
* roar of the ilamcs and intermittent ex
plosions.
A Ftill alarm was turned into engine
house. TS. at Stockton and Francisco
streets, by John ICelly, a lamplighter. A
second alarm was ti^n^il in immediately.
The destruction of the engine works
caused a loss estimated at about J125.000.
only rart of which is covered by insur
ance. The Mendoclno's Coal Company's
stock is nrarly a total loss, and the tene
ments from 320 to 340 Francisco street
\u25a0were more or les? scorched. Gus Stoffer.
driver of Engine 2S. was badly burned on ;
Ihe , face And hands while lighting the
fire. A. Hennessy of the Fame engine
fell from the roof Â«-f a building and
tprajned his ankle.
Jones, who was in the building when
the explosion occurred, has no idea of the
cause.
"I was asleep." he says. ' x he explosion !
woke me. I tried io let the poor horses
out, but the fire get too hot for me. I
have no idea what started the explosion."

and lumbermen from the timber belt
came Into this city yesterday, many of
them with their clothes scorched and
burned. The horses which some of
them rode to escape the fire were bo
badly burned they had to be shot. All
of the lumbermen lost their clothing
and other property kept in the cabins,
as they were obliged to leave every -^
thing and run from the roaring flames.
At Smith's mill the cabins, bunk
house and boarding-house, as well as
the' timber surrounding the mill, were
destroyed. - The are swept down upon
the mill in great sheets, jumping rap
idly from tree to tree. The entire for
est was covered with a. blanket of flame
within half an hour from the time the
fire was first discovered. A great num
ber of the lumbermen escaped death
by dropping in holes of water and into
the Rogue River until the first death
dealing sweep of the flames had passed.

was formed of Â« members of the local
councils, with Frank J. O'Brien as chair

571.555.31 7 and for 1904 was $71,753,552.
,' To Great Britain and Ireland 271,
000,000 gallons ; were sent, Germany
147,000,000 and to the Netherlands 117,
000,000. Only 55.000.000 gallons were
exported to South America."
\u25a0; Cotton manufactures present one of
the striking features of the 'year's ex
ports, having advanced from $22,403,713
in 1904 to $49,606,080 in the year Just
ended. -The growth occurred chiefly In
cotton cloth exports, $14,696.19.) being
the , total. In 1904 and $41.20,542: the
figure for 1905. To China there was
an increase of about 400,000.000 yards
over last year's exportation of 769,000,
000 and the value of other cotton cloth
exported to that country Increased from
'$4,000,000 in 1904 tp, $27,750,0j)0 in. 1905.
Japan was the only other country to
show' a considerable. "lncrease, the; total
being 16,000,000 -yards as against 440.
000 yards In 1904.
The growth, in the exportation of
manufactures is shown _, to have largely
exceeded the growth in population. Out
of thirty leading articles only seven
show a falling off for the year as com
pared with 1904.' Iron and steel manu
factures supply about, one-fourth of the
total exports, having been $134,727,921.
as against $111.945,536 in the preceding
year. Steel rails showed an increase of
$6,000,000, chiefly in shipments to
Canada, South ' America. Mexico, the
West Indies, Japan and other Oriental
countries. Machinery also showed an
increase in 1905 of more than $6,000,000
over 1904.. A curious feature is the
large increase in exports of locomotives
to Japan, 151 having been sent thither
in 1905,' as against seventy-four: in the
previous year.
The exports for the past fiscal year
were not only the largest oh record,
but are in excess of the combined ex
ports of all articles in the centennial
year. 1876, and nearly $140,000,000 more
than the total imports and exports of
the country, at the close of the Civil
TVar. ' \u25a0\u25a0'\u25a0'

The disease that . we have denominated the
grape-shrivel > is not as yet, at ; leaet so far
as known, of any great economic Importance;
but, owing to the circumstances under which
It . occurs. It is highly probable that It exists
elsewhere in the reconstructed vineyards of
California and may, therefore, assume, at
any moment, more than local -. Interest. The
fact that we observed the grape-shrivel In the
East Sonoma experiment >plot, \u25a0' where it took

The ' grape-shri vel develops quite ' rapidly, as
shown by the fact that while no symptoms of
the disease : were â¢ observed â¢on . the 27th -of
June. yet "on -the 12th :of-; July <many vines
wero affected. - By the end of . July practically
every vine In' the experiment plot showed the

through their retentiveneÂ»s, . favorable to its
development. ."Drainage is an excellent pre
ventive measure." he continues, "and' what Is
more the only efficacious one.'*. .But as drain
age It not always economloally possible, a few
half measures that are at leaat useful may. be
mentioned, Â«yen II they have not the virtue
of an elixir. '' , \u25a0'-â¢\u25a0*!
As soon as the disease shows In the vine
yard ' all badly diseased vines (that le. those
vines whose scant \u25a0 growth * shows that their
niatn root-system Is seriously attacked) should
"be remox'ed. t&tKmMBetMKt&&BSRi
The action ' of this dlae ase in its main char
acteristics ia very similar to the malady
known among the FrÂ«nch |ai the Pourrldle, or
Blanc dÂ«s racSnes, and In Germany, according
to Mr. P. Vlala, by the nam* of W'elnstock
faule. The areas of depressed vegetation "\u25a0 that
one associates familiarly with th.c action of
the phylloxera are characteristic also of the
root-rot. In each case there ia a center \u25a0of
infection though, when compared . with the
phylloxera, the root-rot spreads more slowly
and appear circumscribed or local in its ac
tion. Id' the case of the root-rot there may
occur many small centers of infection in close
proximity to one another which may take sev
eral years to merge Into one; whereaa. in the
cae* â¢ of the phylloxera, when Infection is so
general that several centers start very near
one another they rapidly become -one.
Vines affected with the rapid form of the
root-rot can not. of course.: bs saved. Vines
affected with the usual form are,- when
treated before the disease has made much
progress, amenable to treatment. The pre
ventive treatment here recommended applies
equally well to both forms of root-rot. -
The remedial or preventive measures used in
combatting', the' root-rot, or Indeed any other
disease attacking the subterranean organs of
plants are. at best, but palliatives. As the
disease is more general' in soils with an Im
permeable substratum that are quite â¢ retent
ive and miry after heavy rains, adequate drain
ace is and will always remain the only valu
abls preventive- and curative measure. For
excessive humidity is the exciting cause .of
thÂ« disease: . it.- favors fungous development,
and thÂ« tissues of the roots are soft, gorged
with water, and In no condition to resist, the
attacks of parasites. An \u25a0 author (Mr. - P.
Vlala) who has studied the pourrldle of - the
vine and fruit trees with particular care, says:
â¢'One must, . to prevent- the â¢ dlseaaa from
spreading, andrto protect cnÂ«'s self against it
in new plantation*, thoroughly drain the soils
in whieto U exUte. end also those that are.
The root-rot Is renerally of the form just
described, and takes from two to flre years to
kill the vine, but It may. in some rare cases
and In young vineyards, spread with such "ra
pidity that it kills the vines In eighteen
months, and even in a slnsrle season
Mr. Butler's conclusion, regarding the
cause of the red leaf disease. Is as'fol
lows: * "It seeme difficult to; reconcile
facts with the development of a leaf par
asite. We are more inclined to believe
that the red-leaf disease is 'due â¢to the
same cause's as the folJetage and the
rougeot," ' namely," _.a~ disturbance - of the
equilibrium between the absorption of wa
ter by the roots and its transpiration
by the leaves."
In addition to the red leaf disease, Mr.
Butler 'treats, in his bulletin of the grape
shri\ - el and root-rot diseases. His re
marks on the root-rot disease are under
stood to be of unusual importance just
now because the root-rot disease is do
ing a gireat deal of damage at this time
in parts of the Sacramento, San Joaquin
and Santa Clara valleys. In some dis
tricts the root-rot is "far more destruct
ive than the phylloxera.
Of this root-rot disease Mr. Butler says:
The - root-rot is caused by a fungus^ â possibly
several Ifunelâ and in its usua.l form' ls very
easily recognized upon digging up any vine
within an Infected area. The roots are soft,
watery; yellowish-brown in the entire woody
cylindÂ«r. and more or less permeated with
whitish threads â the mycelium of -the parasite
â and glie off a strong nauseous fungous
odor. As the lower roots are destroyed, and
the mortification enters the body .-of- the vine
and slowly eats Its way In the trunk to the
surface of tfcÂ« soil, and even above, nsw
roots are sent out from the still healthy en
compassing tissue; thess roots, In turn, be
come riddled with, and succumb to the at
tucks of the fungus. In the last stages of
the disease {that is. when the vine has cent
out a lew fceblt canes. about a foot long) tÂ»ne
Invariably finds near, or at thÂ« surf ace â¢of the
soil, a very free growth of young teuder
roots.
CONCLUDING THOUGHTS.
Mr. Butler's" observations seem to show that
the cause of the red-leef disease is not para
eltic, but tfm it is probably due to soil and
atmospheric conditions. . These observations
will be kept up during the coming. season, and
a careful examination of the subsoil and mois
ture contents Â«f the experimental plats will be
ma.de through the grotx-lng season,. so that defi
nite conclusions may be drawn.
While investigating the "red-jleaf disease,' 1
Mr- Butler found that a number of maladies,
either parasitic or physiological, were respon
sible in a measure for the weakness or dying
of tbe vines. Among these affections phyllox
era, root-rot, mildew, lack of affinity between
Fdon and stock/ lack of adaptation of stock
to soil, mechanical Injuries, erinose and
black-knot are quite prevalent in Sonoma
County, as well as in most vineyard districts
of California.

On ray return from this trip of investigation
I passed through Xapa Valley to. compare the
"red-leaf disease" with a malady of similar
character that had caused .damage -In some
sections, and; after a consultation with I>r.
E.W. HUgard,' it was decided to start a meth
odic study of the "red-leaf .disease,'.' and Mr.
O. Butler vti appointed to carry out the in
vestlratlone
In IXiCZ thÂ« viticultural department of the
College of Agricultui Â« or the University ot
California, took up th& study of a dlteas* that,
for. a f*w beacons, had beti; observed In So
noma County and was beginning to cause some
anvlety among the vineyardists. After tin in
spection of the vineyards of- Sonoma County
from Santa Rosa, to Cloverdale. Jnoluding tho,Â«
of Alexander Valley and Dry Crtek. we found
that the "rÂ«d-ltaf diseate. ' as the malady
was called, was euffieientiy widespread to rÂ«
culre special attention. The "rsd-leaf ' dis
ease" was, at that time, associated by many
persons with the Anaheim -disease, and by
some with anthracnoee. ThÂ« first theory was
Â«et aside a priori, on account of the difference
In. thÂ« effect, on the canes and grapes, and also
en account of the lack of virulence of the tlU
eaee when attacking the Mission vines. The
tufTgeEtlon that it might be anthracnose was
easily pet aside, as the markings of the dis
easÂ» 011 leav*s, cants and berries are of an en
tirely different character: it is very doubtful
that the true anthracnose has ever been found
in a. vlnejMrd of California.

Mr. Schulte came : to , Mechanlcsville re
cently to ' take temporary charge *of the
Episcopalian Church. â- Early last 'even
ing, Curtis presented himself at the door
of the rectory and asked for a -drink, of
'water. Sir. Schulte was . In the - act; of
turning hack no : set - the water when the
ne^ro felled him with a piece of lead plpa,
rendering him unconscious.' Mrs-* Schulte
appeared a moment later and the- negro
otruck her down. i.HÂ« beat her with the
lead pipe, jnfllctlo* probably ***?* Jn

ing "unconscious and covered with blood,
were discovered by neighbors.'

was pitched. off 4 the cycle, but beyond
arstrained leg: .and minor ; cuts and
bruises, : was/not, badly damaged. The

proaching^ Fourth avenue,' when ; Brown
on his machine: suddenly appeared on
Fourth avenue,' headed north. The men
met! just as. Brown - turned into. > East
T.welf th -street, ; riding toward : Coffin.
Before either cyclist could turn to avert
the collision the machines ran into each
other,; almost head-on. The rapid pace
at which -they were . speeding caused
an impact that- sent. .Coffin headlong
into .thÂ« street. He struck heavily on
the hard block pavement. Brown, as
soon- Â«s he: /could disentangle > himself
from' the wreckage, went to the un
conscious man's assistance.-, The sense

BERKELEY. August 13.â The : clans
that arc gathering at the university/pre
paratory to en taring college for the . new

mencement uf -their v.'ork by a loud call
for counsel, for sympathy and assistance

The question i 3: "'With what arguments
shell Miss Boy c's claim be â¢ disputed?
How shall ihe,young.'co-ed' ;; be made to
Vee the unrighteousness of her demand?
Wherewithal shall the Blue arid j Gold

they turn'" down her /. call for 125, the
recompense : she demands. 'through .her
attorney, for her. labor- as an artist on
the Blue and Gold staff?" . ..-.'*".'.,'.
These be grave questions.' :.;.'.:
There is no college tradition that: cov

be cited by the^ collegians to guide them
in their course between: the: rocks that

depressing effect upon the Blue; and Gold

Remember, that while *there Isâahâmil

Sol Peters is a colored cock. He belonged
to ti:e ship Charmer, which arrived lv tnts
port oa Saturday. He left the ship when Â«he
Â«-v lyisg a* Newcattle. Australia, to go up
tow-n to p*y-*oin<i triesCs a visit. When he
left the vessel he left his goiden coin valued
*Â£ $12u tacked away under- his mattress. When
tie ship was ready to sail Peters had not
turaed up, Â«o a Japanese cock waÂ» engaged in
hiÂ« pla.ee and promptly took pesi^sslon of the
cock's room. ThÂ« ship sailed to Honolulu.
where thÂ« Japanese cook leit the vessel, and
another cook was ecg&ged to take his place.
H* *iÂ«o occupied the cock's room. The ship
thea mailed to this port. When Peters, who
Â«-v HÂ£t behind Â»t Newcastle, discovered the
Charmer t*.d sailed he contrived to work hlÂ»
way on Â«. ateamsh'.p bous.<i for this port. He
arrived fcere abcut three wteks ago and had
\u25a0pect every minute since h:s arrival hanging
around the water front watching the arrival
of the Cbaxmer. which he hoped was bringing
fr'?n L!S lOÂ«t gOid.
No Â«ooaer had the Charmer crossed in
through Â£Â£â¢ Golden Gate than Peters chartered
cse cf Crawler's launches and proceeded to
ttÂ« efclp. He was laboring under Intense ex
c;iÂ«nent Â«.nd his dark face .was of an a*hy
tue. No cse on board the little launch could
vsderstar-.d what w-se the matter with the man.
ThÂ« Qtiarantlne officers had barely climbed
Cowa the Â«lde of the ship when Peters made a
running Jenip from th* top of the launch and
bounded ou to the deck of the Charmer. He
j-a^e a break for his <i*.d stateroom, tore away
tv. e eiattrevs of his bunk and there In the

A .well-known poultry and pigeon
raiser of -Northampton. Mass.. Is com
bating bird lice and other vermin with
tobacco 'stems, with the aid of the
birds' intelligence ' and prudence. He
believes he * has found. a solution" of the
lice problem, if he can only get his
chicks : used .to the smell of tobacco.
The pigeons use the stems for nests,
and , prefer'"them to the cleanest hay.
They are much coarser than hay. and
dp not make, so soft a nest," but the
birds seem to realize that the tobacco
odor keeps away the troublesome lice,
and sacrifice softness to cleanliness.
The Stems have been placed In the hens'
nests, also, and while the old birds
nestle down as comfortably as if they
were brooding on soft sweet-smelling
hay the little chicks are not won so
easily. They, sldleaway. and. if It were
not for the persistent admonitions of
their, mothers, - would wander far from
their tobacco"' perfnmed nests. But It; is
believed that the chicks will readily
become acclimated' and -give up their
plan to : Join the white rlbboners. The
bird raiser procures "the stems by the
bushel from the -local cigar shops and
intends to give then a thorough trial.

Gaul's beautiful, cantata, "The Holy
City," wes rendered last night at the
Central Methodist '- Episcopal ; Church.
Mission street, between Sixth and Sev
enth! by five soloists, a chorus of twenty
two voices and â¢ a most capable orchestra
and th organ. ;
Fully Â£500 worshipers crowded ;the
church, and there must . have been quite
500. turned* away from .\u25a0 the sacred edifice,
unable to gain admittance.
The wonderfully, melodious and .master
ly work was given â¢ faultless interpreta
tion, the voices ..being rightly balanced
in quartet," duet and trio. The unaccom
panied trio, "It shall come to pass that
at: eventide it shall be light," was espe
cially .effective. ..
"The. chorus, took up that exquisite mel
ody., ! so" appropriately "wedded to the
words. "Holy. Holy, | Holy Is the Lord of
Hosts," with fine judgment, and the
quartet and chorus, for ' treble and con
tralto voicesâ": .
â¢Several attempts to adjust the differ
ences in. the matter of freight. trafSc have
been made during the last twelve months;
but have - utterly failed of . satisfactory
results until a few days ago. when a set
tlement was made and a definite freight
tariff was agreed upon.
A circular will be issued in a few days
to \u25a0 California shippers by the transconti
nental lines affected to the effect that a
settlement has been arrived at and that a
new through rate will be announced as
soon as it has been properly compiled.
This news ..will be received with much
satisfaction. in this State, where shippers
have eagerly looked forward to a settle
ment.
Freight Traffic Manager Sproule of the
Southern Pacific Company has been ad
vised by; Traffic Director J. C. Stubbs of
the Harriman lines that the long pend
ing troubles between the transcontinental
roads and the Southeastern lines have
been finally adjusted and that a through
rate on ; transcontinental freight destined
to points within the territories of the two
big combinations of railways will soon
be: restored. The disruption Of traffic re
lations between the Southern Pacific, the
Santa Fe and the Great Northern and
the roads constituting what are com
monly known as the Southeastern lines
occurred about a year ago and has since
materially - affected tho California citru3
and dried fruit shipments, and the*man
ufacturers of the East, who are In the
habit of shipping* the products of their
factories to this coast.
When the Santa Fe announced its In
tentions Of "building south from Eureka.
Harriman, .*. through his trustworthy
friend, President A. W. Foster of the Cal
ifornia Northwestern, made public the
statement that that 'road would be rapid
ly extended to Eureka, and work of con
struction on an extension ;6f : the line
from Willits has sinca. been :. started. It
is now learned that- the engineers 'of, the
Santa Fe Company, after several careful
surveys of the routes southward ffOm the
southern terminus of the San Francisco
and Northwestern, have reported t against
the advisability of building, on-the ground
that-the work would be most expensive.'
CONTROLS EUREKA* WATER TKOJiT.
President Ripley finally-agreed with the
views of his engineers and then; made a
proposition- to" Harriman mat they, enter
into . some arrangement .;\u25a0'. whereby j both
roads 'can. use the same, line 1 for trafflc.
Ripley- argued with Harriman that .In
asmuch as the Santa Fe practically con
trols-all the water front, of ' Eureka, Vit
would be difficult for the Southern Pacific
to reach the- waters of -Humboldt Bay.
With thi3 advantage, t Rlpleyj finally con
vipced 'Harriman of- the ad visibility A. of
joining issues and the head of the . Harri
raari syndicate was not slow in appreciat
ing, the : fairness of his opponent's propo
sition. /As a result , Harriman.' will .carrx
out the. extension plans on tne California
Northwestern and : when", a' through line
is perfected he will extend to Ripley the
necessary, trackage privileges, and receive
the same business courtesy -from 'the
Santa -Fe over Its ' rails funning Into Eu
reka. By. this agreement -the two trans
continental roads will save several mill
ion dollars find at the same time enjoy' the
same i amount /of traffic business In the
north that- They would have secured .*
two roads had been built. ' > .
Since the Santa Fe quietly sent its
agents to Eureka two years ago and ac
quired possession of the^Eurtka and Eel
River road, which has since ' been ab
sorbed by the San Francisco and; North
western Railroad Company/ and an
nounced its intention' to , build south ; to
San* Francisco Bay the people of the
north, have, been hoping to soon see two
competing "roads entering-' Eureka with
freight from San Francisco and carrying
south the immense products of the red
wood forests of.Humboldt and'Mendocino
counties.
This- information comes from a most
reliable, source, through which it was
learned yesterday that the long-existing
difficulties between the Southern Pacific
and the Santa Fe roads over a northern
route to Eureka- were settled at a recent
conference between Harriman and Rip
ley In Chicago, just prior to the former's
departure on his Western journey;^
>O HOPE OF COSIPfcJ .'ITIOX.
An agreement has been, entered Into T>y
President K. H. Harriman of the South
ern Pacific Company and President E. P.
Ripky of the banta Fe under which the
California Northwestern, of which the
former has secret control. ; will soon be
extended north to Pepperwood, there to
connect with the San .\ Francisco and
Northwestern, tÃâ¬ property 'of the
Santa Fe. and thus furnish a dt
rect: overland' route , from * !d&.n -.Fran
cisco to Eureka. In other^ words,
Harriman and Kipky have agreed that
one railroad line is sufficient to handle
all the traffic originating in the "vicinity
of liumboldt Bay and 'that the interests
of both transcontinental lines can be bekt
served "by an interchange, of trackage
privileges in Northern California:
The Toyo KisÂ«n Kalsha steamship line
is about to resume busintcs between here
and the Orient. It was officially an
nounced yesterday that the steamship
\u25a0America ilaru would leave Yokohama for
this port on or abou: September 15, and
from that time the regular service of this
line will be resumed. The two other
â¢teamshif^ belonging to this company,
the Nippon ilaru and the Hongkong
ilaru. win so into service as soon as they
can be put in i-undition. They have been
out of commission for over a year. Short
ly after the war between Russia and Ja
pan broke out these three vessels were
taken off thÂ« line between here and the
Orient ar.d handed uver to the Japanese
Government. Th<y were then changed
Into auxiliary cruisers and have since
been in charge of the Government. Now
they are once- more turned back to the
BteamshJp company, which will put them
back into the passenger service.

RED TAPE has for so long named those superfluous, or popu
larly supposed superfluous, details of systematic methods in
officialdom the word itself has become a weariness. Presi
dent Roosevelt's newly appointed Committee on Department Meth
ods will have fine opportunity to give the term a needed rest by
abolishing many of the irritating delays and formalities which
caused its coinage. It is good to be rightly systematic, "for this both
facilitates transactions and safeguards , them . from mistake ; but,, no
doubt, the very essential good of system has been hindered and
slandered because of the excess in non-essentials which made r thc
reproachful term "red tape" so popular and so condemning.
With the work of this new committee we are to begin ah era
of . advance . toward scientific administration. It may lead tofiiiore
system in the right way, and less of it that is merely dilatory to no
compensating purpose. When people feel assured of the wisdom of
the \u25a0 s}*stematic methods they will be patient with the necessary
amount of it. Much of this assurance will be born of the commitj
tee's work. They are beginning that wortf by putting over a hun
dred pertinent, printed questions to each department, and also , to
each bureau and division under them. For one important thing
these queries ask if the duties of one bureau or division overlap or
are shared in part by any other bureau.
In case they do, what are the arrangements "for cooperation?
That is a very pertinent question, and shovvs at once the need of
this supervising committee on methods that will make administra
tion scientific. Various divisions might be doing very perfect work
considered as units, but for lack of this general supervision- they
might be uselessly duplicating work that was already done, or their
toil lose much of effectiveness becauseof lack of co-ordination/with
the efforts of others. Another .very appropriate questionV is as : to
what is the division of responsibility between the Secretary, the
assistant secretaries and the chiefs of bureaus and divisions.
To demand the careful answering of a hundred such searching
questions as these. will: not only necessitate strong individual think
ing among the chiefs, but it will stimulate. to more effectiveness
that wonderful communal thinking process of the whole organism,
which is so nearly unconscious that individuals would seldom reaiize
its existence did not science call attention to its being a factas" real
as the co-ordination of thought iii each individual: brainâ of the in
tricate methods of which we are only semi-conscious.
The Committee on Department Methods owes its/birth to the
President's observations of faults in administrative' system. We
may expect from it a gain in economy, expedition,^ relegation^ of '- red
tape, definite fixatioiv of responsibility, ;.and,^perhaps;._ above'* al|r'"ia''
more perfectly arranged network of wireless 'â¢'communication, be
tween all the best admihistratiye brains the nation. possesses.

\u2666-pHERE was more variety in trade last week than for several
J months past, and reports" from all sections showed more or less
. * irregularity. <
The feature of the week was the issuance of the Government
grain crop report, indicating a wheat crop of 686,000,000 bushels, a
corn crop of 2,593.000,000 bushels, and an oat crop of 880,000,000
bushels. These, with an estimated cotton yield (of about 9,000,000
bales, with the usual large hay crop not included in the calculation,
comprise the basis upon which the country expects another -year of
prosperity. It is a good basis, for large crops mean a great traffic
for the railroads, the employment of vast numbers of men, the ready
circulation of money, a large demand fo.r all sorts of merchandise
throughout the country, the maintenance of credits, good collec
tions and highly remunerative returns to the farmers. Hence, the
importance of good crops cannot be overestimated..
But no excited improvement in vthe volume of business is ex^
pected to follow the announcement of abundant crops. The infor
mation has been largely discounted, for, the great financial and com
mercial interests of the country watch the development of the crops
as closely as the Government, and the report of the latter is \u25a0 simply
confirmatory of opinions practically formed some weeks ago. Still,
it is good to have this confirmation, and business will naturally ex
pand with the issuance of the Government figures.
Wall street has been building great expectations upon this crop
showing, and the bullish feeling already pervading the stock mar
ket, which has carried many Wall-street- securities to almost the
highest quotations on record, will probably be even more pro
nounced from now on. All reports say that stocks are Jn very
strong hands and will hot come upon the market in any quantity
except at still higher quotations than those now ruling, especially
as the different railroads and industrials are now paying increased
dividends and their holders will not be disposed to let them go, es
pecially with prospects of still higher prices later on.
There has been a noteworthy expansion in the demand for
staple products during the past week, especially in the West. St.
Louis, Kansas City and other large Western and Southwestern dis
tributing centers report a marked increase "in the distribution of
general merchandise, with buyers in full force in the large towns
and heavy orders for fall and winter goods. New York and Phila
delphia report a flood of buyers from all parts of the country. Ship
yards, car shops, textile mills, iron and steel works, general manu-.
facturing plants, lumber yards and hardware distributors all report
a lively movement. Business in dry goods, notions, groceries and
clothing is brisk, and cotton and woolen mills in many. districts re
port orders for at least six months ahead. â¢
The footwear factories are also doing an active and increasing
business, though the Western boot and shoe jobbers -have nor
placed the customary spring orders, owing to the difference' of views
between buyers-and sellers. The hide and leather markets are high
and the demand for both these products has been a feature of trade for
months past. Half of the wool product of the country has already
been sold, though it has not yet altxbeen shorn, and sellers of cotton
fabrics cannot satisfy* all the requirements of buyers. .Bradstreet's
reports that taking staple prices as a whole the level of values is at
the highest point reached in midsummer for fifteen years. The
single item of wool shows an advance of 50 per cent over this time
a year ago. Â£fB
The current statistics affirm this brilliant trade exhibit. '" The
clearings of the country last week ran 33.6 per cent ahead of 1904,
with large gains at almost all the large cities, the aggregate clear
ings amounting to $2,233,000,000. The failures for the week were
222, against exactly the same last year. The railway earn*
ings continue to show a satisfactory increase over 1904.
Thus it will be seen that there is marked activity in all sorts
of business all over the country. The only unfavorable develop
ments of the week were a number of bank and commercial failures
and the yellow fever in the Gulf States, though conditions of. the
latter factor are not of the panicky nature of former years, when
less effective sanitary precautions permitted a more rapid spread of
the disease and over a much wider area. These factors, therefore,
weigh but little in comparison with the marked prosperity of the
country at large and show no pronounced indications of becoming
more acute.
MORE DIVERSITY IN BUSINESS.

Listen; you who are despondent;. you who. perhaps are tempted to glvÂ« up the
struggle. Recall the times vln ypur life when -you. have, been certain, absolutely
certain, if only for a flash of time,, of your high destiny. Certain of good, of God.
Remember the magical mood you captured, the mood that showed; you the high
est possibilities for power and beauty: And achievement. in yourself. The mood that
gave you a vision crystalclear, so that you no longer looked upon the people about
you as pÂ«tty and full of faults: tna mood that showed you the soul 3 of persons, the
core.of nature; the heart of, all your experiences.
That -was" the 'real -vision. "Do hot actupon any other. If you are on the verg^
of despair., if you art contemplating a .reckless act. which in that exalted mood
would have seemed Impossible to youâ wait.
" Do notiake the srep.~ Be -patient till the cloud passes and.you see again with
the clearer, vision. '. For. It is true as. sunlight thatthe, only real estimate, the only
Perfect- viqw, is that which sees evil ad but a transient phase and "good as the
permanent "conditionâ the reality.
"Hold fast to the best things you have ever believed. Have faith in them.. Th^y
are real. "Stand by your 'exalted mood and believe it will come to you again. So
surely.as you have faith, you. will know that certainty and that happiness again.

mate always/ The \u25a0\u25a0 shapes you ccc are
distorted shapes. -Tour vision is at fault.

During the meeting 'Of | the : -, executi ve
committee. E.* J. Llvrmash .the
way In which the California jjj Congress
men regarded 'the' affairs of the Jupanfcss
and Korean league. He stated the
delegation from this State had no
sympathy for the League move
ment and that -'the- only \u25a0 way
to get them interested with the cause
was to make them afraid of the teastie
In' politics. He "told of the necessity of
having the entire Pacific Coast enlisted
in thÂ« cause for which the men in San
Francisco were laboring, and suggested
a movement to get the labor- unions in
Seattle. Portland, Denver. Los Angeles
and Butte to affiliate, in thjÂ« work. His
attack on the Congressmen was? based on
their net having taken trouble, to; attend
the . meetings of the league, saying that
condition? were being brought to bear on
them making them in favor of admitting
Aflatics to the United. States..
Prominent among the \u25a0 ypeabtrs at the
meeting was E. I. Wolfe. He was em
phatic in his demands that the League's
cause be * given more publicity '.< and laid
great stress on. the HnEmciaJ ,end of the

zation. . ' ' .

of the week, but was- opposed by- ranny
of the numbers until told that the league
interests should supersede others.
Four committees to accomplish, the pur

long discussion, as follows: Committees

$4,000,000 a Very Modest Estimate,
Vivfclle $ 100,000^000" Is a Reasonably'
Decent Figure. .
.; In passing it may. be' of interest to note
the idea ;of this , pampered optimist - re?
gardlng .what consUtute's . a "moderate"
estate or fortune. "The Senator was ques
tioned, regarding the raising of young
Hyde's salary from â¢ $75,000 to $100,000 a
year. He had been chiefly Instrumental
in having it" advanced, and in explana
tion said that one : consideration .was a
senUmental regard for the services whlcn
the elder Hyde had rendered to the
Equitable Life Assurance Society ana
the comparatively small compensation
which he took in return. : He 1 left only a
"very moderate estate." Asked if the eld
er Hyde left a fortune of less than Â»0.
000.000, Mr. Depew said it was understooa
he left â¢ "less thkn half thaf-whlch
would mean that. say. $4,000,000 is consid :
ered by -him a "very moderate estate.
Hyde might have been a "hundred mil
lionaire," said Depew. which figure seems
to represent his idea \u25a0of a fairly reason
ably decent fortune. And could we ex
pect a more contracted notion of tmn o s
from aman'who, as. a. director of one
corporation, is receiving 120.000 a year for
doing next lto nothing-worse than noth
ing, should it not be?-and is. a director
in seventy odd other corporations and en
terprises which may possibly also con
sider him a "master of corporation law.

You can't eat yoVf cake and have it
too. > If. you cut flowers all over your
grounds, particularly near the house,
the place will not look its best. More
over, we none of us have enough cut
flowers - for house decorations and to
give away. If you plan to raise a great
many flowers for cutting in beds and
borders you] are simply inviting back
ache and hours of unnecessary work.
The cheap, easy and sensible way is
to have a separate place 'for raising
flowers that you want for cutting.
Select a place that is, out of the way,
so that the removal of the flowers will
not spoil the' garden or landscape ef
fect. The vegetable garden is just the
place, because you can have long,
straight rows and cultivate them easily
by horse or wheerhoe. You can trust
an ignorant laborer to hoe anything
that is in straight lines, but he is the
ruin of an informal border.â Garden

Owing to the fact that the restaurants
went out of business the first of the week,
the editor and staff are bachingâ that and
other reasonsâ and yesterday a rural sub
scriber brought us a piece of limburger
cheese, saying that if we didn't care to
eat it we could use it to drive away ants.
â¢Will it drive away ants? Will it! Verily.
I say unto you, -It 'will -drive dogs out of
a tanyard ; it will drive buzzards away
from . a carcass: it /will drive a herd of
buffalo through a burning forest arid a
mule through a barbed wire fence; it will
drive a man crazy if compelled to stay
within twenty, feet of its polluted pres
ence; indeed, it will drive away antsâ
and uncles, too, and mothers and fathers,
brothers, sisters and grandmothers, even
to the seventh" generation. , Still there are
some who claim to like limburger.âFree

Larry Schlafley was relieved of the
opportunity to win laurels through too
strenuous remonstrance with J. Ira
Davis and was told to "go way back,"
etc. It happened over Flood's hit in
the third. Flood landed at bag number
one about the same time as the ball
and in about the same manner as
Schlafley had a few minutes previously.
Umpire Davis called Flood safe, while
be had decided that Schlafley was out.
This aroused Schlafley'sire and he told
Davis a few things about rank injus
tice and partiality, and. Davis declared
Larry in contempt of court and put him
where he couldn't be heard so plainly.
The score:
This reputation-making effort of
Hoftmr.n's gave Cates ample opportun
ity to waddle over the rubber.- arid Los
Angeles was down and out. That's all.
Up to that time the Spider's wing had
swung: rythmically, allowing only three
of the webfoot Giants to do augrht but
fan the air and wonder why. Esslck.
for Portland, like Baum, had kept his
opponents guessing. The fielding was
great. Only two. errors were made and
these were excusable.
it fell in the hole just back of second
and In. front of center. â¢.
â¢ day. He has the earmarks of a comer,
i keeping his head at all times. His peg
| g-ing was weak. Score:

Although the contest was always close
it was lacking in sensational features,
and the Meicherites had but few oppor
tunities to exercise their lungs. The Oak
lands, as usual, were off to a good start,
but this time they did not let the champs
forge ahead. The northerners were usu
ally hitting Ham's offerings a mile in the
air. They ..Id not get a hit until the flfth
Inning, when McLaughiin managed to
line enc out to center.
Oakland started like a cyclone in the
opening round and made Keefe look like
a busiftr before he retired them- Van
Kaltren led off with a clean single to
center, and was advanced a- peg when
Francks sacriSced. Van went to third
en an unmolested one to center by Dun-
Imvv. Kruger'e single cent Dunleavy to
third, and he scored on the fourth hit by
Kelly. It looked good for a few more,
but Croll ended matters by tending an
easy one to Keefe, who threw. the runner
cut at first. Krug-er was doubled by try
" ing t<s beat the throw home.
After the first round trie game nar
rcwÂ«d down to a pitcher's battle with
honors about even. Tacoma scored their
enly tally in the sixth frame, with a Eln
gie and a triple. Graham led off with a
hit and vcent as far as thrrd on a. sacri
fice and an out- Here Sheehan. gave the
fan? a chance to exercise their vocal
crgans by lifting one out In the neigh
borhood of the flag pole. By some good
>printlag Tommy made it count a three
fcacker. He died at the three-quarter sta-Â»
"tl'on because I>yke could jioX cxmnect^afe-

Oakland clinched the game at Recrea
tion Park yesterday in the opening Inning
by touching Bobby Keefe for four bin
gles, which cjetted them, a brace of runs.
From this lcnlng en Keefe proved a mys
tery, but the Tacoinas were unable to
overcome the Commuters' lead. Iberg
had Mike's men swinging their heads off
trying to solve his floaters. Four hits
distributed through three Innings was thÂ»
limit of Ham's generosity. ScoreâOak

Grasses: His Fifteen Birds Without a
MlsÂ» In Competition With
CleTer.TxaW Shots.
As usual, interest centered chiefly In the
first class. The new classification gave
promise of some close and exciting
matches. To the surprise of all, every
match in the class was won in straight
sets and not one was close until the finals
were reached.. The biggest surprise , was
the defeat of George Baker. The latter
did, not even make a showing against
George Janes, after having defeated Carl
Gardner easily. The play of both Gardner
and j Baker was a I great disappointment.
Janes also disposed of C. Griflln handily.
Adams went through his half as easily
as did Janes and, at, no time had to ex
tend himself. >: In his .first . match he met
the veteran R. N. Whitney, ajid beat him
easily. ; Adams . next took on Foleyv and
again won as he pleased.
Janes played the best game he has put
lip in months, but It was not good
enough to win a set from Adams. The
score, - which was 7-5, 7-5, 8-6, " was closer
than the match.- Janes was at all times
on the defensive and Auams led con
stantly. The winner played the same fast
game that won him the State champion
ship, and demonstrated that he is. easily
the cleverest player In this part of the
State. 1 ' \u25a0 ''. .. . ,'' . :
~ In> the second .class Hotchkiss and
Guerin * both won their matches In straight
sets." The closest match was thatÂ»between
Brabant and Hotchkiss. Brabant won the
first set but lost' the next two. .
The third class matches were closer
than those 9 of I the. other three classes.
Martin and Kahn each received a default
in the first, rounds and each had. an easy
match In the second. - ; \u25a0
In the fourth' class Allan had his hands
full in all of his matches. His opponent
in" the finals, 3 Lucky, was all his name
Implies until the finish, when he was
taken into camp by Allan. The latter
won the . first- two sets by a small mar
gin and led at 4-1 in the third set, when
Lucky -defaulted.
- Seven teams competed in the handicap
doubles . tournament at the California
Club! ' Smith \u25a0 and ". Beyfuss -, played fine
tennis when they beat the Long broth
ers in the* finals. The -winners have had
little or no practice of tete. but played
the game as well as ever. Smith did some
remarkably good smashing ' in the â¢ finals
and received good support from his di
minutive partner.
