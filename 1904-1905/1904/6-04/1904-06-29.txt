will continue- The Duke of Devonshire
Is expected to join Lord Rosebery, the
Liberal leader, in a few days.
The -army question, it is believed,
will be the rock oa which the Govern

lieved that this question will divide the
Cabinet and cause its dissolution when
it comes up for voting in September.
Then, too, it Is thought the army dis

colors and bring the Liberals a record

is less than one-third of its normal
majority.

ST. LOUIS. June Â».â It was an
nounced to-day that Charles A. Gutke.
former member of the House of Dele
gates, convicted on a charge of
bribery and scon to be tried on another
similar charge, had made r a complete
confession to Circuit Attorney Folk in
which he declared that former Dele
tate^Pranic T. Kelly had teld him he
had reveived $30,600 for going to Europa
when his presence in St. Louis Jeopar
dized men of prominence. Kelly also
is resting under one conviction and is
soon to be tried in another case. Circuit
Attorney Folk says that the revelatiocs
which have been made by Gutke open
cp many new avenues of Investigation
and brings facts to light which have
not been heard of before, involving
men higher up.
"When he came out cf the oSce of
the Circuit Attorney, Gutke said:
"The best reparation that I can make
for the wrongs I have done is to con
fess fully to everything in order that
the public may realize what has, been
going on. Yielding to the pleadings of
my wife. I have determined to do all I
can to atone for my sins against the
public. The people of St. Louis even
now do not realize how they have been
persistently plundered for years and
years by the men they elected to make
laws for the city.

came a member of the combine of

John Shrogg. a cellar attendant at
607 Market street, was caught in tho
lift of a sidewalk elevator yesterday
morning and nearly killed. Shrogg
was standing on the lift when the
table suddenly shot upward, carrying
him with it against the cover. Thi-i
fortunately was not bolted. He re
ceived a severe blow on the side of tho
head, breaking the cheekbone on tho
left side of his face. The injured man
was treated at the Central Emergency
Hospital by Dr. Stevens. .
Caught in a Sidewalk Elevator.
The RIalto was stirred yesterday by
the news that James Durkln, formerly
leading man at the Alcazar, had aban
doned his wife and was about to leave
for the East with Miss Frances Starr.
About the time that rumor had him
taking the train for New York Durkin
was having an earnest consultation
with his wife. When interviewed later
he seemed perfectly free from care and
claimed that the affair had received too
much prominence. Durkin belittled the
stories told and said that much more
of falsehood than truth had been print
ed. When asked when he intended
leaving for the East he replied, "Fri
day." He further said that Mrs. Dur
kin would also leave for New York;
that she would go on Friday also, and
on the same train with him. He de
clared he had no knowledge of the
whereabouts of Miss Starr and did not
know whether she had left for the East
or not. He would not say whether he
and his wife had been reconciled, but
thought there might be a chance of Its
being brought about.
Mrs. Durkin refused to affirm or deny
her husband's statements.
In the meantime Durkin has been
using every effort to conceal his move
ments. He telephoned to the Alcazar
Theater to have his trunks given over
to the Union Transfer Company when
called for, but refused to say where the
expressman was to take them. Closest
inquiry has failed to discover where
Miss Starr is staying. -Two weeks ago
she changed her residence, but refused
absolutely to give her new address.
There was a rumor yesterday that she
had left in the morning for the East,
but this was denied on good authority
at the Alcazar.
Mutual friends have been endeavor
ing to effect a reconciliation between
Durkin and his wife and they claim to
have been to some extent successful.
The witness further said that
the . money was always loaned
on warehouse receipts and the
only member of the firm with
whom he ever did business was
Jacob Eppinger.' He had never actu
ally demanded any wheat from the
firm until after the failure and could
not. state positively whether all the
loans made the firm had been made
through him personally or merely on
his general instructions.
As was expected, a night session was
held, but it was productive of Ut.tle
aside from wordy arguments. Sheriff
Veale of Contra Costa County was
placed on the stand and questioned re
garding the alleged tender of $100 , to
James Demlng for a warehouse book
and an offer of a salary of $100 per
month untllthe conclusion of the trial.
The arguments of counsel on these
points were not concluded when court
adjourned until 9:30 o'clock this morn-
Ing.
"Did you rely upon the statements
made you by Mr. Eppinger?" he was
asked.
"I relied upon them absolutely."
"How much did you pay toward the
prosecution of Mr. Eppinger?"
"Five hundred dollars."
"How much did he ever owe your
house at one time?"
"To the best of my recollection it was
$50,000."
On cross-examination by Attorney
Ach, Mr. Hellman gave this testi
mony:
"Very well," said Mr. Ach, "but I
give notice at this time that if an ad
verse ruling is made I will take the
matter into the Federal courts, even
if it does tie up the case."
The day's proceedings were barren of
sensation," although much testimony
was given by local and outside bankers
regarding transactions with the de
funct grain firm.
The prosecution sought, through its
witnesses, to show that Jacob Epplnger
knew his firm was on the brink of ruin
long before the collapse in June, 1903,
and had borrowed money on receipts
for grain which was not in the ware
house. R. M. Welch of the San Fran
cisco Savings Union told of money
loaned Jacob Eppinger in April, 1901.
When asked to pay the note a short
time prior to the failure. Eppinger had
said that he would give wheat of equal
value to that called for in the receipts
and would pay the balance on June 1.
To the knowledge of Mr. Welch the
payment was not made and the firm
failed on June 6.
I. W. Hellman. president of the Ne
vada National Bank, gave some inter
esting testimony as to nis dealings
with Jacob Eppinger and the handling
of warehouse receipts. He told- of Ep
pinger's visit to him to negotiate a loan
and his faith in the business standing
of the firm.
BELIEVED EPPINGER.
Just as Judge Lawlor's court was
about to adjourn last night Attorney
Henry Ach, chief counsel for the de
fense, announced his intention of fur
ther delaying the trial of Jacob Eppin
ger If necessary in order to obtain cer
tain documents. Ach said he had been
Informed that the prosecution was in
possession of certain documents which
would be of use to the defense and
asked that the court make an order
compelling the District Attorney to
surrender them to him. Attorney
Campbell argued that the court had
no authority to make such an order
and Judge Lawlor said he would take
the matter under advisement.

ST. PETERSBURG, June 29.âGen
eral Kuropatkin has decided to with
draw northward. This move gives the
Russians the advantage of being near
er their base of supplies and places
the Japanese at the disadvantage of
having longer lines erf communication.
Kuropatkin no longer prevents a junc
tion of the enemy's forces by remain
ing at Tatchekiao. since he might
thereby imperil the safety of his own
troops, as the d2sperate character of
the fighting at Ta pass and Fenshui
pass on June 27 shows that the Japan
ese have a very strong force uncom
ftrrtably near the Russian flank.
No further advices from the front
had been received up to midnight,
though news* from General Kuropatkin
and Rear Admiral Withoeft was eager
ly awaited.
Though it appears now from General
Kuropatkin's tactics that a heavy en
gagement may be deferred for some
days, it is possible that the Japanese
may rush matters, but it is not gener
ally expected here that General Kuro
patkin will give battle until he reaches
a position of his own selection.'
POSITION OF THE ARMIES.
It may clarify the military situation
to explain that the country in which
the armies are now coming into con
tact consists erf a series of mountain
chains running parallel with the rail
way, alongside of which the Russians
are falling back as the Japanese ad
vance. Fenshui, Motien and Dalin are
all passes which take their names from
the mountains through which they run.
General Kuroki, who has heretofore
been east of these mountains, is ad
vancing to the westward from Siuyen
through a very rough country and his
cc-lumns must traverse the passes
named before emerging into the more
open country along the railway, ap
proximately abreast of Tatchekiao,
Haicheng and Liaoyang. The Russian
outposts and the Japanese advance
are now in close touch at all
these passes. The Russians, after har
rasslng the Japanese advance from
each of these positions, are falling back
on General Kuropatkin's main body,
which is supposed to be somewhere be
tween Liaoyang and Tatchekiao.
General Kuropatkin is now moving
slowly northward along the railway,
and wherever he makes his stand
there will be precipitated what is ex
pected to be the decisive battle of the
campaign.
In the meantime General Oku is ad
vancing along the railroad on the heels
of the .withdrawing Russians. He is
backed by a powerful army. How large
a portion of this army he has detached
to join General Kuroki has not been
developed, but it is probably large
enough to add material severity to the
fighting before the Russians finally
abandon the mountains.
CAXNOT CHECK THE FOE.
The Emperor has received the fol
lowing dispatch from General Kuro
patkin. dated Liaovang. June 27:
"The Japanese attacked our forces
occupying Mc-tien, Fenshui and Ta
passes on June 26. Our infantry and
cavalry retreated, persuaded that the
advancing divisions of the Japanese
army, which were operating against
each of the three passes, were stronger
than our detachments. In an attack
on Ta pass the Japanese guards, be
sides other regiments, participated. The
Japanese made a frontal and flank at
tack in considerable force on both
sides of this pc-sition. The Japanese
troops occupied Fenshui and Motien
passes during the morning of June 27
"Our forces which retreated from the
Fenshui passes were attacked by small
detachments of Japanese. These were,
however, easily repulsed.
"After pushing back our advance
guard during the evening of June 26
from Vandiapudze (on the Siuyenhal
cheng road) to Ta pass, the Japanese
continued their advance this morning
against our position in a defile. For
some time the attack of the Japanese
infantry brigade was repelled. . Three
battalions were engaged In the frontal
attack, but being menaced by other
troops engaged In a flanking move
ment, our forces retreated.

Upon the opening of the Pacific
cable at San Francisco Middleton was
sent to institute the cable department
of the Associated Press in that city.
With the imminence of the Russo-
Japanese war he was among those
drafted for that service by the Asso
ciated ress. He sailed from" San
Francisco on January 15 for Yoko
hama, thence to Shanghai. With the
progress of events he went to Seoul,
but on account of his knowledge of
languages was finally ordered to join
the Russian headquarters In Man
churia and to do so he went to Chefu,
from Chefu to Peking, thence to Tien
tsin and from the latter point to New
chwang, where he entered the' Rus
sian lines and proceeded to Mukden,
joining Viceroy Alexieff's headquar
ters. Later he proceded to Liaoyang
and there recently reported several
engagements.
KNIGHT REPORTED KILLED.
TIENTSIN, June 28. â It is reported
that Edward F. Knight, the corre
spondent of the London Morning Post
with the Japanese army, was killed
at Wafangtien.
Several engagements between the
Russian and Japanese forces have
been reported as having occurred at or
near Wafangtien, that town x having
been occupied by the Japanese on
June 19, and it is possible that if the
report of Knight's death be true he
was killed in one of these battles.
Spectators at one of the engagements
say that they saw three horsemen ap
pear on a hill, one of whom resembled
either an American or British attache.
This man fell from his horse when the
Russians fired and evidently was
killed.
CAMK TO SAX FRANCISCO.
Henry John Middleton, the first of
the American war correspondents to
lose his life at the front in the present
conflict, was representing the Asso
ciated Press at General Kuropatkin's
headquarters near Liaoyang. He was
taken sick with enteric dysentery less
than a week ago and only on Sunday
was a dispatch received from him in
which he requested that a substitute
be sent to relieve him. - He was about
33 years of age, unmarried and was
born in London.
Middleton was a vivid descriptive
writer, a linguist, a student and 'one
of the best posted, men on interna
tional affairs. He became connected
with the London Bureau of the Asso
ciated Press in 1892 and filled almost
every position except superintendent
in that office.
While his career contains many re
markable Journalistic feats which
brought him praise, perhaps his most
brilliant work was in reporting for the
Associated Press the Dreyfus trial at
Rennes, where he made a name for
himself in competition with such well
known men as Julian Ralph and Harry
D. Stevens, whose admiration and re
spect he obtained at that time. Though
unassisted, he often forwarded four
and five columns a day of the interest
ing pictures and dramatic incidents of
that great case.
CAMBRIDGE. Maes.. June 28.âSec
retary of War William Ii. Taft. in an
drcss here this afternoon before the
Harvard Law School Association, made
some important declarations regarding
the future of the Philippines and the
Filipinos. He said that the Filipinos
fnu*t wait twenty years or so before
they can be thought fit for independ
ence..
â¢Â¦â¢'I am in favor of teaching the peo
ple how to govern themselves," he said,
â¢*and I cannot assume that such a les
,son, so difficult to learn, can be taught
to a people. Â£0 per cfnt of whom are
grossly ignorant, to-day without any
political experience^ whatever in nve
years, as some of our opponents say, or
m twenty years, as others suggest. If
ultimately the Filirinos are taken in
behind the tariff wall, as I hope ;fnd
pray they mar. it would tend to de
v*Iu;> the islands in such a way that
they might prefer to maintain some
sort of i bond rather than separate
thtmselvts and become independent. "
At a banquet to-night, Richard Olney,
referring to American rule in the Phil-
Ippineft, *aid:
"According to him (Taft) we are rich
enough and can afford it and therefore
it. iÂ» our <Iuty to sacrifice American
ii\'*a and American treasure indefinite

and elevation of Filipinos according to

*uch proposition at once issues another
Jegai puzzle for the modern American
lawyer to find in the national constitu
tion, any authority for purely philan
thropic enterprises â any right In that
Government to turn itself Into a. mis
sion to the benighted tribes of islands
in the S^uth SeAs, 7000 miles from our
shores, or any powers to tax the toiling
maffof of this country for the benefit
of rantley groups of the brown people

NEW YORK, June 29.â The World
has the following copyrighted cable
gram from Tientsin: "It is believed
that the Japanese losses were one bat
tleship, two cruisers and five destroy
ers in Thursday's engagement. Subse
quently the Japanese began a simul
taneous bombardment and land attack
on Port Arthur, but were repulsed."
CHEFU, June 29, 2 p. m.â Chinese
arrivals from Port Arthur report a
large vessel, presumably a Russian
vessel, on the rocks ten miles southeast
of Liaotshan promontory. Three fun
nels and two masts are above water.\
The Chinese also state that after thÂ«
Japanese fleet moved away from the
entrance to Port Arthur on June 24
the Russian fleet again emerged, re
maining out a short time.
Fighting is reported to be continuous
on land and frequent from the sea.
LONDON, June 28.â A dispatch to the
Central News from Tokio says it is re
ported that another Russian battleship
has been dscovered stranded off Tiger
Rock. It is presumed she was wrecked
while returning to Port Arthur after
the recent naval engagement.
ST. PETERSBURG, June 28.â News
from the Port Arthur squadron is ea
gerly awaited. The city is full of
rumors, chiefly based on foreign tele
grams. A report that Rear Admiral
Withoeft, in command of the navaJ
forces at Port Arthur, sailed off after
giving battle to the Japanese receives
the most credence. Withoeft is known
to have full authority to leave Port
Arthur if he deems it advisable, and he
possibly preferred not risking a return
to the harbor, which might again be
blocked, preventing his egress at a
critical moment Consequently that
official may now be steaming to Join
the Vladivostok cruisers. The Minister
of Marine is anxiously expecting a fur
ther report, but none had been received
up to the hour of filing this dispatch.
TOKIO, June 28.â An unconfirmed re
port has been received from the island
of Hokkaido that ships resembling the
Russian Vladivostok squadron had ap
peared off there on June 27. " Similar
reports have been received from other
places along the northern coast of Ja

CHECKED BY IGNORANCE
CHEFU, June 28.â Letters received
here to-day from Port Arthur, dated
June 23, give no news, but convey an
idea of the conditions prevailing in the
besieged city. One writer says the
civilians, though knowing something of
what is occurring, are ignorant of the
progress of the war. Little information
leaks out. Most of the hon-combatants
have caves in the hills or underground
cells, where they spend the nights in
safety. Bands play occasionally in the
parks and the prices of food are slight
ly higher. The Chinese are suffering
severely in many ways, as a result of
the lighting.

of regular work, have established eat

TOKIO, June 28. â Unofficial Jap
anese experts would be surprised were
Kuroki to throw his army against the
Russian position at Motien Pass. It
seems fairly safe to say that his tac
tics in that quarter are designed to
hold the Russians in the pass, pending
a further development of the cam
paign in the, west. General Oku's
army has already strategically out
flanked Kuropatkin's chief mountain
strongholds. Their evacuation proba
bly will be automatically accom
plished, as the hero of Nanshan forces
his way northward.
Of course, if any position in front
of ejther the army at Fengwangcheng
or the army at Takushan is weakly
held it will be seized. Moreover,
strong pressure wilPbe maintained ail
along the line in order to prevent the
transference of troops to support ths
Russians who are opposing the -.d
vance of Oku. General Kuroki still
keeps a considerable force well to the
north, apparently with the intention
of attempting to intercept Kuropat
kin's retreat, should the Russian com
mander in chief try to retreat and .'t
should prove impossible to send an in
tercepting column straight over thÂ«s
mountains toward Liaoyang.
Japanese Attempting to Cut 'Off Uie
Retreating Russians.
The telegram from General Kuropat
kin, as published in a special edition
of the Official Messenger, informed St.
Petersburgers that General Kuroki's
army had crossed the three passes of
the Fenshui Mountains and was ad
vancing in strong columns from Siu
yen on Haicheng and from Fengwang
cheng on Liaoyang, while portions of
General Oku'sarmy were moving north
eastward along mountain paths to
strengthen the attack on Haicheng.
The same telegram reported a cavalry
engagement at Senuchen, indicating
that the Japanese retreat southward
was only a feint, as forecasted in these
dispatches.
General Oku has again assumed the
offensive and is supporting General
Kuroki. The Russian resistance is cen
tered in the region east of Tatchekiao.
The Japanese have failed to make an
advance in this direction, which is re
garded as denoting the presence of a
large Russian force at Tatchekiao.

is moving northeastward with the in

"At noon to-day our cavalry was

"All the reports of the last few days
state that the forces of Japanese ar
rayed against our Manchurian army
consist -of eight or nine infantry divi
sions and several brigades of reserves,
which also occupy positions in the
fighting line."
Motien pass and Fenshui pass are
about due east of Liaoyang. Ta pass
is midway between and north of Mo
tien and Fenshui passes, and is be
tween Liaoyang and Mukden and about
seventy-five miles from the railroad
connecting Liaoyang and Mukden. It
will thus be seen that the Japanese
forces which have occupied the passes
mentioned are turning the left flank
of the Russian position at Liaoyang
and are threatening the railroad con
necting Liaoyang and Mukden.

by C. O. Sherman of Chicago, secre
tary of the International Metal Work
ers' Union. "Let Bell try to drive
union men from Denver." he con
tinued. "If he ever does it Denver
will sink in its ashes. There will not
be left a thing that can be burned.
The torch will be applied in every
quarter of the city. The miners have
stood about all they can. They must
resent further indignities, and they
will."

SAN RAFAEL; June 28.â On motion
of the District Attorney, the informa
tion filed against James N. Phillips,
charged with escaping from State
prison, was dismissed to-day.

that inasmuch as Phillips had been

unaccompanied by violence he had been

case, which was granted.

SIOUX CITY, June 2S.â Miss Ethel
Hornfck, a California girl, whose
mother, Mrs. Nora Hornick, resides in
Oakland, was married here to-night to
Dr. William Wallace Walker, a den
tist and clubman of New York City.
The nuptials are the culmination of
an attachment formed over the foot
lights of the Empire Theater, New
York.
Miss Hornick has been a member of
the Augustin Daly and Charles Froh
man companies for ten years. She is
remembered on the coast, where she
played with Margaret Anglln and
Charles Richman In "Mrs. Dane's De

30. They left to-night for Europe to
spend the summer.

VICTOR, Colo., June 28.â The fourth
and, General Bell says, the last de
portation of union miners from this
city was made at 7 o'clock to-night.
In all thirty-four men were shipped
out, making a total of 1S1 to date.
Four Deputy Sheriffs and a squad of
National Guards under command of
Captain Moore have orders to leave
their prisoners at Colorado Springs.
Peace and auiet prevails, but. martial

COLORADO SPRINGS. June 2S.â
The Reduction Mill at Colorado City,
owned by the Portland Gold Mining
Company, closed down this afternoon
for two weeks. The necessity of mak
ing repairs and a shortage of ore, oc
casioned by the recent closing down
of the mine at Victor by the military
authorities, are given as the reasons
for the action.' There is no doubt that
the mill will be non-unionized when it
resumes operations, since the Mill and
Smeltermen's Union is affiliated with
the Western Federation ' of Miners,
against which the Portland directors
declared themselves ten days ago. If
this action is taken the non-unionizing
of all four of the Colorado City Re
duction plants will have been com
pleted.

Scott Is big and broad-shouldered. He
carries a gun and dresses picturesquely,
wearing a large hat and loose, flowing
red necktie. He tells a tale of woe
passing strange, but It seems to be sub
stantiated.
Scott, cool and unperturbed, arrived
at 7:30 o'clock this morning. Trainmen
to whom Scott had confided his loss
at Harrisburg had wired ahead and
found Detective Long, of the city force,
and others waiting. The mine owner
was accompanied by an old comrade.
Eugene Hay of Belleville, 111.
Scott's story Is that having cleaned
up a fine stake out of his mine, he
started on a trip East to have a good
time, an incidental feature of which
was a wedding at Jersey City. When
he left San Francisco It was too late
to send hi3 precious nuggets by ex
press. So he put them in a trunk and
checked the trunk. When his train
reached Pittsburg Scott met a lady
and spent the afternoon in her com
pany. When he caught the train he
found his treasure all right, but the
baggageman declined to check such a
valuable piece of property. So Scott
got a canvas sack into which he trans
ferred his treasure and boarded the
train. In the Pullman he met his
friend Hay They sat up late drinking.
Scott had his own bottle of liquor and
his own glass. He* took his canvas
sack for a bedfellow. At Harrisburg he
awoke. The sack was gone. He com
plained and then went to sleep again.
"It. isn't the loss of the stuff I mind."
says Scott. "I've got a roll left and
there is plenty more where the dust
came from. But what will the boys
say when they hear of It! Why, Death
Valley will ring with their merry ha
ha."
PHILADELPHIA, June 2S.â Walter
Scott, owner of the Peerless mine in
Death Valley, CaL, is temporarily so
journing in Philadelphia, while the de
tective department and many railroad
officials are endeavoring to locate a
sack containing 120 pounds of gold
amalgam, valued at $12,000, from which
the miner avers he was separated while
journeying from Pittsburg to Philadel
phia.
A wedding that was to have taken
place in Jersey City has been tempo
rarily postponed and Scott is trying to
think up excuses to square himself with
"the boys" in Death Valley.

"He's the Minister from ,"
said the boy.
"Oh!" said the officer, and with a
word of advice not to do so again he
turned the whole party loose. A test,
equally as interesting, as to the ex
emption of legation property from
taxation-Is now being made. The le
gation property of Sweden and Nor
way was assessed for taxation on the
ground that it was owned not by the
Government represented, but by the
representative â his personal or indi
vidual property. The representative
protested, and, as he went away for
the summer, referred the matter to
the State Department.
This exemption from taxation and
control of law extends to all the per
sonal property and effects of the
foreign representatives. Children
born within the premises are as dis
tinctly alien as if born in the distant
land of the flag that flies over them.
GERMANY'S PROPERTY.
Prussia, only so short a time ago
as 1S04, was the first to establish its
own legation here. It has since be
come that of united Germany. It was
originally located oa Fifteenth street,
but the property was sold recently be
cause of the encroachment of business
houses, and Is now established in
handsome brick and stone on Massa
chusetts avenue. It was In this house
that Prince Henry was entertained
during his stay in Washington.
Great Britain owns some 30,000
square feet of the triangle bounded by
Connecticut avenue, Nineteenth and N
streets. The Embassv building is a
mansion containing more than fifty
rooms, cost $125,000 and was built in
1S76. The property is surrounded by a
high Iron fence, and, together with the
English Ivy that has spread over the
building, lends It an air of exclusive
ness. The building is of red brick and
its furnishings are elegant and costly.
Mexico established ltr embassv In
1SS7, building a handsome establish
ment on I street, between Fourteenth
and Fifteenth. Opened with a magnifi
cent ball, it was occupied for eleven
years bv Minister Romero and his
American wife. The latter died there
in 1S98, and her husband, just elevated
to the rank of Embassador, followed
her three months later.
Japan owns an unpretentious three
story building on N street, between
Thirteenth and Fourteenth, formerly
the residence of General A. B. Capron,
bought in 1S87.
Korea in 1S99 purchased a rather
handsome building on Iowa circle, at
the Junction of Thirteenth street,
where have resided the mysterious rep
resentatives of the hermit kingdom.
SUMPTUOUS QUARTERS.
Austria-Hungary's embassy, on Con
necticut ave'nue, was purchased from
former Senator D. I* TuleÂ« of Florida
at a cost of $50,000, and in its furnish
ings and decorations Is rated as the
most elaborate foreign residence in
Washington.
France designs to eclipse all other
countries in the magnificence with
which its Embassador is to be housed
in this country. It has purchased at
a cost of $100,000 a tract of land em
bracing 70,000 square feet In the
choicest residence section near Con
necticut avenue, with frontages on
three streets. A staff architect of the i
French Foreign Office . has paid two |
visits to the site. He is designing a
$300,000 palace, which will represent
the best type of mrfdern French do
mestic architecture. It will not be
completed short of two years and in
the meantime the Embassador resides
at the home of Hon. Bellamy Storer,
present Embassador to Austria-Hun
gary, on Rhode Island avenue.
China has a home recently com
pleted and costing $100,000, located
at Nineteenth street and Vernoa ave
nue, "Washington Heights.
Italy, has purchased the former res-
caâ so commissioned by the President
of the United States.
CONSULAR SERVICE.
In this connection it may be noted
again that the United States of Ameri
can consular service â as you will â
which sometime was held in very
slight esteem at home or elsevtfiere.
Is so distinctly on the uplift as to have
been responsible â at least this Is as
close as it may be traced â for having
given Mr. Bryan that new idea which
he acquired while abroad. He was
so impressed that he was going
to see to It that the Government
owned Its legation premises wherever
they are established and add all that
it might to the dignity of its repre
sentatives in foreign lands. Not much
progress has been made in this.
The United States owns such prem
ises In but four cities, and these all
in the Far East. Two years ago prop
erty was purchased at Peking and a
building constructed at a cost alto
gether of 5100.000. In 1S92 a legation
was purchased at Tokio, Japan, by
virtue of an act of Congress appro
priating money therefor. The Siamese
Government in 1S90 made the United
States Government a present of a
handsome house at Bangkok for use
of Its representative to that coun
try. The other, the fourth, was the
first establishment of the kind to be
got up by Uncle Sam. It was
in Seoul, Korea, and was pur
chased In 1SS6. In these several
houses reside representatives of this
Government amenable no more to the
laws of the land in which they are
than if they were In Washington
City. The houses and the lands upon
which they are situated belong abso
lutely to the" United States, and
those who reside there are required
to obey only the laws of the United
States.
LAWS ARE IMPOTENT.
Similarly in Washington there are
ten of these foreign embassies or le
gations against which Uncle Sam
may assess no taxes and his laws are
impotent as against their occupants.
A few days ago several lads were
rounded up by the police, caught in
the act of bathing In the Potomac
River within the city limits, contrary
to law in any case, and especially so
as they were sans even a breech
cloth.
"Who is your father?" asked the
officer of the ringleader, and by way
of sending the man word that his boy
was in the lock-up.
INQUIRY IN WASHINGTON
All that has been done. It is declared,
is to authorize the use of the word
"American," which is more euphonious
than the wards "United States."
tt has"tn fact been the custom for
years to designate in the official. mail
the residences of the diplomatic offi
cers abroad as "the American Embas
sy." cr "The American Legation." Mr.
Hay has extended this custom to "The
American Consulate" and "The Ameri
can Consulate General," a matter of
euphony only. It Is said. All these offi
cers will, in their commissions, still
represent the United States of Ameri-
**The story cf how Secretary Hay has
substituted the word "American" for
"the United States" In reference to the
foreign consulates has created a great
deal of newspaper gossip. Explanations
have been variously made. It is said
that there has been no disposition on
the part of the State Department to
change the official designation of the
diplomatic or consular representatives

Canal Commissioner Grunsky of San

heart is set. No man will do this per

night, after a session of several hours,
selected for temporary chairman of the
national convention to-morrow Homer
L. Castle of Plttsburg and for tempo
rary secretary W. G. Calderwood of
Minneapolis. Nominations will be made
on Thursday.
A letter written by General Miles to
J. G. Woolley of Chicago and dated
from Washington City, June 20, which
was made public to-day, is believed
by National Chairman Stewart and
others to eliminate General Miles from
consideration as a Presidential candi
date. A manifesto was issued to-day
by those who are insisting that General
Miles make a declaration of his position
before being offered the nomination for
President. Among those who signed
this manifesto were National Chairman
Oliver W. Stewart, National Secretary
James A. Tate, J. F. Butler of Cali
fornia. A. B. Laynton of Oakland, Cal.;
J. B. Cranflll of Texas and G. W. Cal
derwood of California.
With the arrival of the New York
delegation to-day one of the delegates
made public Miles' letter to Woolley,
which concluded as follows:

The contricts signed to-day resulted
from tests covering a period of two
years. The immediate necessity of pro
tecting the canal zone by wireless con
nection Â»s well as by other means of
communication prompted the final
agreement. The announcement is made
that the Deforests Company has al
ready begun the erection of a station
at Seattle, Wash., for the purpose of
experimenting on the Pacific and it is
gaid that an attempt would soon be
made to communicate with Japan.
The Navy Department has received
permission from the Department of
Commerce and Labor to establish a
wireless telegraph station on the Far
allon Islands off San Francisco and is
now arranging to equip a station at
once.

POSTAL DEPARTMENT'S
CHIEF CLERK RESIGNS
CALL BUREAU. HOTEL BARTON.
WASHINGTON, June 2S.â Important
contracts wore signed to-day between
the Navy Department and the Ameri
can Deforest Wireless Telegraph Com
pany for the installation of a wireless
service under Government control. The
contracts cover, these points: Key West,
Fla.. Porto Ri,co, the exact location
yet to be determined, and Guantanamo,
Cuba, and a station In the Panama ca
cal zone. The power is also to be in
creased at Penfacola, Fla.. in the sta
tion now operated by the Government
for communication with Key West.
Key West, Porto Rico and Panama
make an equilateral triangle approxi
mately 1000 miles to a side, and the
Deforest Company guarantees satisfac
tory results between these points and
also 1000 miles at sea. Thus the station
in the Panama canal zone will operate
1000 miles into the Pacific.
Special DlKpatch to The Call.
The Call made a poll of Democratic
members in Congress and in the entire
membership only a half-dozen men said
they were in favor of a reaffirmatlon of
the Chicago and Kansas City plat
forms. More than 100 Democrats de
clared it would be party suicide for the
national platform to reassert the posi
tion of 1896 and 1900. Senators Teller of
Colorado, Tillman of South Carolina,
Dubois of Idaho, Carmack of Tennes
ree and other loyal supporters of Bry
an in his two unsuccessful campaigns
all said the. time for going into ancient
history was past and that the platform
should declare for new things.
I find a growing feeling in the West
that the party must go farther than
that in its platform. Many bankers and
merchants v.ho wish to support the
Democratic ticket once more will insist
that the party not only repudiate free
silver, but take an advanced position in
favor of the gold standard.
Bryan is going to the convention with
many fights on his hands, and one of
them will be to insist upon a reafllrm
ation of the Chicago and Kansas City
planks. The sentiment of the party is
overwhelmingly against him. On his
return from Europe last winter he gave
an interview in which he said that he
wanted the national convention to de
clare for the free coinage of silver at
the ratio of 16 to 1. Instantly a pro
test went up from Democrats of every
State in the Union.
CHICAGO, June 28.â What the finan
cial plank in the Democratic platform
shall be Is a question which Is giving
trouble to conservative leaders, who
desire a declaration which will serve to
show the business interests of the
country that the party has put behind
its worst heresies. There will be a very
strong element at St. Louis demanding
that the con<"*U<on not only refuse to
ratify the < *-**aro and Kansas City
platforms, byj JtUt it shall directly re
pudiate the Uryan money plank and
declare for the gold standard.

Another Meeting Will Be
Held Soon to Settle the
Question of Supremacy
The politics of the Labor party Is
in a chaotic condition. There Is trou
ble in the ranks and no leader knows
Just who holds the balance of power.
For three hours last night the two
factions, led by the lieutenants of
Mayor Schmitz and the Hardis-Bergea
clique, battled for recognition, but
when the final conference ended noth
ing had been accomplished beyond a
mutual understanding that there would
be more talk and more politics.
So bitter is the difference between the
two factions that neither side will ad
mit the other Is a recognized power
with authority to call for primary nom
inations. Each side admits that such
action on Its part may jeopardize the
nomination of a candidate for Congress
from the Fifth District. Even with that
fact staring them in the face neither
side will give way and allow the other
to call the nominating convention.
Both factions met last night. The
Hardls-Berges crowd had more than
twenty-five "members of unions" in at
tendance at 102 O'Farrell street, while
the Schmitz end brought some thirty
stalwarts to the gathering at 32 O Far- f
rell street. Each side knew the other
was meeting. The Schmitz contingent
claimed they were the whole thing an.l
had all the authority. The other faction
declared they were the only ones to do
business for the Labor party.
To prove to the world that every
thing that might be done in the way
of politics was open and above board
both sides held executive sessions. This
was due to fear that something might
get to the "enemy's" ears. The Har
dls-Berges contingent sent Messrs.
Verges, Rogerson, Coglan and Myers to
confer with the men who represented
the Schmitz end. The two factions
met, but the question of apportionment
was not settled. The Schmitz people
wanted to have the exclusive say and
the Hardis people would not consent.
If there is any question as to the
delegates to the convention the Hardia
faction claim they will have the best
of the proposition from the fact of
their offering to play even.
There will be further meetings of the
two factions soon. An effort will be
made to arrive at some understanding,
as the time left for filing nominations
is short. Just what day or night the
two meetings will be held has not yet
been decided.

BY AL 3ICCABE.
RENO; Nev., June 28.â "California
for Hearst" is placarded on all sides
of the Democratic special to St. Louis,
and, judging by the warm receptions
accorded the delegates and generous
donations of fruits and wines received
by them from points along the route
to-day, this declaration Is more than
one would have supposed after wit
Â¦nesslng-vthe recent Santa Cruz con
vention.
After much photographing and
"farewelling" of the delegates the spe
cial train pulled out on time. and.
although stopped at several points by
enthusiastic Democrats, It is still run
ning close to schedule.
That the fellow townsmen of Sheriff
James A. Keys of Solano County hold
that gentleman in high esteem was
convincingly attested by the enthu
siastic crowd of his friends who as
sembled at Suisun to speed him on his
journey. An informal committee of
his friends had arranged an im
promptu farewell for him and nearly
all the town was at the station to
shout "Good-by, Jim," as the train
pulled out.
Noticeable among the number were:
L. G. Martin, Judge J. M. Gregory.
District Attorney C. M. Gregory, Col
onel R. D. Robblns, Assessor Ed Long.
J. A. Linehan, R. C. Halle and C. P.
Reeves.
J. "W. Reams boarded the train at
Suisun and will journey with the dele
gates to St. Louis. Keys' friends had
also collected about 100 boxes of
choice California fruits, which were
added to the supply for display and
distribution at the California head
quarters in St. Louis.
When the train reached Sacramento
there was enthusiasm to burn. The
delegates from that county (the re
cently elected Treasurer, D. W. Car
michael, and P. C. Cohn of Folsom)
are popular men there and the promi
nent delegates had hired a band to
give them and the California delega
tion a fitting send-off.
Speeches from the delegation were
called for, and the chairman of the
delegation, Hon. M. F. Tarpey, re
sponded in his usual vigorous and
terse style, promising to keep Califor
nia well to the fore in the convention
and to nominate a son of California for
the Presidency if strenuous effort
would accomplish that result.
Among the prominent Democrats
noted at the depot were Major "W. J.
Hassett, Superior Judge P. Shields,
District Attorney Arthur M. Seymour,
Thomas Fox, M. R. Beard, J. H. Hur
ley. J. G. Snook, Morris Brooke, Wil
liam McLaughlin and ex-Mayor W. D.
Comstock.
After cheers for Hearst. Tarpey, Car
michael and Cohn and the loading on
of more fruit and wines, the contribu
tion from the Sacramento Chamber of
Commerce, the journey was resumed,
and. with the exception of stops at

STOCK ISSUED TO PROVIDE
STRONG CAPITAL RESERVE
So Declares Harriman in Explaining
Recent 3Iove of tlic Southern
Pacific Directors.
NE\V YORK. June 28. â E. H. Har,
riman, president of the Union and
Southern Pacific railroads, to-day de
fined his opinion of the stock mar
ket as "conservative."
"As prices show â¢ no signs of going
down," said Harriman, "I expect they
will take a turn upward."
In : referring: to the reports that
the greater part of .the Southern Pa
cific preferred stock issues would be
used in acquiring the stock of the
Atchison Railroad. Harriman said: :
"There is no foundation for the
current reports respecting the pur
pose of the additional $60,000,000 is
sue of Southern Pacific preferred
stock. /The main purpose has been to
provide the company with a strong
capital reserve."

Delegates to the Democratic National
Convention left San Francisco yeSter
day in an orderly, subdued fashion.
There was neither shouting nor en
thusiasm. The music by the band was
rendered in slow time and a minor key.
The deportment of the delegates re
minded a disinterested spectator of a
procession of honorary pall-bearers at
a state funeral. If the band had ren
dered the famous march from "Saul"
nobody, would have been surprised, for
the soft tread of the delegates was sug
gestive of solemn business.
The majority of the delegates went
across the bay on the 10:30 a. m. boat,
but Mr. Delmas, who was deeply en
grossed in the wor.k of preparing his
great speech, did not cross until 11
o'clock. The special train, however,
waited for him and the speech.
M. F. Tarpey, chairman of the dele
gation, was in fire form and gave Mr.
Delmas the glad hand when the latter
joined the throng.
There were two banners in view. One
in blue and gold bore the inscrip
tion: "California. 1904. Delegates' to
Democratic National Convention. St.
Louis." The other banner came from
Hawaii, but not for the first time, as it
was exhibited at Kansas City, Mo., in
1900. To the old inscription: "Kansas
City. 1900," the words: "St. Louis.
1904," have been added. The banner of
the Hawaiian delegation presents this
profound axiom: "Ua Mau Keea, Opa
Ania," which means that the life of the
land is established in righteousness.

Luther Elkins presented a call for the

the "delegates elected to the State con
vention within said Congressional Dis
trict shall be the delegates empowered
to nominate a candidate for Congress

The apportionment of representation
to Assembly districts is as follows:

The Congressional campaign in the
Fourth District will be short and sharp.
The nominee will not be chosen until
late in September, therefore less than
seven weeks' time will be devoted to
campaigning in his behalf. The Re
publicans of the Fifth District will
not invite an extended campaign. It
is the sense of party leaders that a
campaign of six weeks can be made
as ' effective as a contest of three
months' duration.

SAN BERNARDINO, June 28.â A
sensation was caused here to-day when
it was know that Polina Garcia, the
nineteen-year-old son of a leading
Spanish resident of this county, who
lives at the Kentwood ranch, some ten
miles from here, had eloped with pret
ty Vlncentia Trujillo, a child who is
only 14 years of age, the daughter of
a well-known resident of this city.
The parents of the child had objected
to the match, and It was learned to
day that yesterday the boy had drawn
all of the money due him by the rail
road company. Footprints under the
window of the girl's bedroom told the
story this morning, and the Sheriff's
office is looking for the pair, who were
last seen about midnight, walking
hand in hand along the Santa Fe track.

peared along with the petition named.
After several days' search Manager
Sands of the Sunset Company located
Kendall last night and insisted upon
recovery of the lost petition. Kendall
led : the way to the room of Frank Mor

company, and they took the missing
petition from a space between the
walls in a section of the Jones building
which Is seldom visited.
The petition had been hidden there.
The document was turned over to
Sands. Kendall and Mortimer were ar
rested, charged respectively with grand
larceny and receiving stolen property.

DISPOSES OF PETITION
TO RIVAL CONCERN
E; r-ci:.: Dispatch to The CaJl,
â¢ STOCKTON. June 2S.â A sensational
cimtest was begun here this afternoon
in the estate of Ross C. Sargent, the
millionaire pioneer of San Joaquin
County, who died June 15, 1903. Bertha
Fhepard, better known as Bertha
Freshman of San Francisco, who
claims that the dead pioneer promised
to make her his wife, altrough he was
Â£2 and she was but 19 years of age, al
leges that Safsent left a will and that
he made her an heiress to the extent
cf $50,000.
MIbs Shepard filed a petition in the
Buperior Court to-day alleging that the
millionaire left an olographic will
â¢which, however, is not in her posses
sion. Ehe alleges that execution of said
will ean be proven by at least two
creditable witnesses. The petitioner
prays that the order appointing J. P.
Sargent and Mattie Sargent Wilber
forcÂ» administrator and administratrix
be revoked, all other proceedings in
va"Acted and that the Judge receive
proof of the existence of a will; that
the said Â¦Rill be established and ad

tion was filed by C. L. M. Bartlet, who
represents Bane.
To a Call representative Mr. Bartlett
Â¦*!&:*

coming to her. There can be no ques
tion â¢ but Mr. Sargent Intended
to marry her and we anticipate no
difficulty in proving the existence of
the will, although we haven't it in our
â¢possession."
. Miss Freshman, as she is known
here, lived in the millionaire's house
hold and he was known to think a
meat deal of her, but it was always
thought to be the affection of a father
toward a daughter. Sargent paid lav
ishly for Miss Freshman's mainten

HORSES HAVE NARROW
ESCAPE FROM FIRE
Firecracker Starts a Blaze That Con
sumes Many Stalls at San Jose
Race Park.
SAN JOSE, June TS. â Two blocks of
Etalls were destroyed by fire" at Agri
cultural Park at noon to-day. The
Fta'ls are along the west side of Race
.streef, between Park avenue and Santa
Clara street. A blaze was discovered
ifcFuing from a stall near Park avenue
anti in forty minutes sixty stalls had
bten destroyed. The fire is believed to
have started from a firecracker thrown
in Â°the stall by some boy. There were
about ten horses in the stalls, belonging
to J. N. Minor, T. Cabrey, H. Hoga
boom and W. Jones of Modesto. All the
animals were removed Just in time, and
JrÂ» doing so some of the stablemen had
their hair and clothes singed by the
Â£re. â¢ In loss than ten minutes the two
blocks of stalls were a roaring furnace.
As > there Is no water supply in the
neighborhood for a time it was feared
that some houses across the street
wqjild catch fire and burn. The loss on
the stalls will be about 51000. Of the
horsemen H. Hogaboom is the heaviest
loser, about $200 worth of harness and
trappings being destroyed.
CAMERA CLUB AT FAIR.
San Francisco Organization Revels in
Snapshot Fiesta at Exposition.
CALL BUREAU, WORLDS FAIR.
ST. LOUIS, June 28. â Thirty-two
members of the San Francisco Cam
era Club, under the leadership of W.
J. Street, have swooped down on the
World's Fair and are reveling in a
snapshot fiesta that will result In a
photographic panorama of the fair
when the negatives are developed. The
Camera Club delegation is making its
headquarters at the San Francisco
building. In one corner of which the
club has a display of photographs.
These represent scenes in and about
San Francisco, Including some strik
ing "bay views.
J. W. Erwln, who was president of
the Camera Club four terms, is in
teresting many people by his lectures
at the San Francisco Hbuilding. His
years of devotion to amateur photog
raphy have resulted in the production
of many excellent views that illus
trate the commercial greatness and
the scenic grandeur of San Francisco
and also the State at large and the
finest reproductions of these are made
on the screen.
The buildings of the model city are
attracting as many people as any
others on the ground in comparison
to size. There are two good reasons
for this. One is that they are locat
ed next the Lindell boulevard en
trance, perhaps the most prominent of
the exposition, and the other that they
represent important centers of popu
lation, the people of which are anx
ious to see them. ; Scarcely any person
who visits one of these buildings fails
to enter the others. San Francisco
makes the prettiest exhibit of any.
Her building has been thronged each
day since it opened and the attend
ance increases dally. George P. Wil
comb and Mr. Erwin are both kept
busy attending to the \isitors and sup
plying information. It will be several
days before the final work is done on
the exhibit.
HUNDREDS OF VISITORS.
The few days that the building has
been open have been sufficient to
show that San Francisco is fortunate
to be represented in the model city
and that if the work is carried along
In the^-proper manner the coast me
tropolis will be given one of the most
beneficial advertisements it has ever
had. Hundreds of visitors make in
quiry especially about the sea voyage
to the Orient, the Antipodes, Hawaii
and the South Sea Islands, and they
all show deep interest in everything
else San Franciscan.
The University of California Glee
Club, which has sung at the San Fran
cisco and State buildings several
times, has made a hit at the fair and
visitors strive for opportunities to
hear it. The stv.Ient singers will soon
be home in California. They took
trips on the lagoon two or three nights
and the much talked of "singing gon
doliers" had to wrap their moth-eaten
voices up those nights and remain
mute, while the crowds in the boats
kept in the wake of the university
singers and Instrumentalists. On the
Pike the boys have been swept into
shows by pleased managers, who have
enjoyed their singing outside.
The building for the Benguiat col
lection of Persian fabrics and old world
relics that is coming from San Fran
cisco will soon be under way. Mordecal
Benguiat, who is superintending the
work. Is receiving every assistance
from the fair management, which is
anxious to have the exhibit installed
as soon, as possible, as it deems it an
attractive feature.

TACOMA, Wash., June 28. â James B.
formerly engaged in steamboat
ing between White Horse and Dawson,
has arrived from Nome with 5130,000,
taken from claim No. 3. on Dry Creek,
c few miles back of Nome.
Wood has spent five years In the
north sec-king gold. After purchasing a
claim â¢ on Dry Creek he sank three
Fhafts, finding a bedrock pay streak at
clnety-sevcn feet, some of the dirt run
ning $20 per pan. He installed hoisting
and constructed several miles of
ditches to bring in water. All last win
ter, he had a force of twenty-six men
taking out dirt, using 80,000 feet of tim
.ber to support shafts and drifts. With
the opening of the sluicing season six-
teen 'men were able to shovel in dfrt
worth several thousand dollars daily.
FRESNO, June 28.â A little romance
of the sunny skies of Italy has just
been told in which 18-year-old Marie
Trombeer plays the principal part.
Marie has been in America but a few
weeks. While in her native land she
and L. Imperatrice had plighted troths
and parted, he to come' to America to
seek his fortune and later to send for
her. But It was a case of "out of sight,
out of mind," and she soon found .an
other lover. He t^o came to America
and both located in Fresno.
She corresponded with â¢ . both, but
really cared for Skelto, It seems, for it
has become known that they formed a
plan to have her come to America on
the money, sent by Imperatrice, and
once here, she would wed her true love.
Marie came and. was met by Impera
trice, who wished to hasten the mar
riage, but was refused. His Italian
blood was soon boiling and he sought
revenge. He won over her brother-in
law, who attempted to force Marie into
the wedding with the "man she did not
love, but whose money she . had used
by false pretenses. She was fast in
her resolve and even a beating did not
cause her to flinch. .. M. Gatto, the
brother-in-law, was arrested to-day on
a cruelty charge.

NUMBER ONE PAYS FARE
The ostrich plumes shown in the Los
Angeles exhibit hold a crowd of ladles
daily. They are of beautiful variety
and perfectly curled and to the femin
ine sex they are a great attraction. ..
Through the Republican convention
at Chicago, Just ended, and the Demo
cratic gathering of the same nature to
be held here in a few days, the throng 1
of Californians at the exposition has
been greatly augmented. There Is a
steady influx now from the farther
West. St. Louis is more easily reached
by the people of the coast than Is Chi
cagoâat least it seems closer to them
â and more Pacific Coast dwellers are
likely to a.ttend this fair than visited
that at Chicago. Besides times are
better now and the average person has
more money to spend on amusement.
The Tokay grape industry in the
northern part of San Joaquin County
is the subject of much inquiry. Henry
F. Ellis of the Stockton and San Joa
quin county display answers many
questions dally about this region,
which is famed for its productiveness,
as are the reclaimed lands below Stock
ton. Stories of the wonderful crops of
Tokays, watermelons and fruits of the
Lodl and Woodbrldge region and of
potatoes, chicory and asparagus on the
lowlands find many interested hearers.
Commissioner Brown and his assistant,
Mr. Ellis, give every parÂ£ of their
county the fullest representation. The
exhibit Is made up of products from
every part of San Joaquin and none
better are shown in the California sec
tion. Many strangers have expressed
their Intention of paying Stockton a
visit.
dreds of California teachers will soon
be here to attend the National Educa
tion Association Convention. .
Rev. Duncan Wallace of Fresno Is
visiting the fair on his way. home from
Dallas, Texas, where he has been at
tending the General Assembly of* the
Cumberland Presbyterian church. He
secured next year's meeting of the As
sembly for Fresno. It will bring about
1000 visitors to that city.
Canteloupes from Los Angeles and
peaches from the Sacramento Valley
have aided for several days In the em
bellishment of California's exhibit.

REAL ESTATE TRANSACTIONS.
Lewis A. Hicks of the firm of Lind
gren & Hicks, the contractors for the
building on Center street, in front of
which the trees flourished until the
axman got in his deadly work, was
non-committal when approached for an
interview on the subject of trees this
afternoon. . It was really all news to
him, he said, and he refused to commit
himself in any way.
The womenj of the Town and Gown
Club did not have anybody arrested to
day for cutting down five spreading
elm trees on Center street as they had
intended. Now the vandal has another
day of grace, â¢ while Lhe To\yn and
Gowners go around gathering up evi
dence that they hope will put him in
Jail for 100 days or make him suffer the
cash penalty of $100 that the ordinance
imposes upon all such offenders.
The clubwomen will have a confer
ence with Justice to-morrow morning.
They have an appointment to meet
Justice Edgar at 9:30 o'clock in his
courtroom, there to present their evi
dence. If the Justice is satisfied with
it he will forthwith issue a warrant
for the arrest of the culprit.
The publication of their designs be
fore they wefe quite ready to sink the
barb of justice into the flesh of the
desecrator of trees somewhat discon
certed the prosecuting witnesses and
they changed their plans. But they
are still indignant and full of deter
mination to punish somebody. Mrs.
Freeman, the representative of , the
civic section of the Town and Gown
Club, wished It understood that it is
not a personal matter, but something
in which the whole town is Interested.
"This movement is not directed
against any individual," she said. "It
is not intended to be persecution. It is
simply designed to furnish a whole
some Ies3on to somebody. I am sorry
that our ipla^is are revealed, as we now
have to change them."

Mrs. Danforth was arranging her
toilet and at the moment the explosion
occurred was heating curling irons over
the flame from the lamp. That she
quickly lost her senses was evident
from the fact that she could not get
out of the bathroom.
Immediately after the accident was
discovered the father . was summoned,
as was Mr. Danforth from San Fran
cisco. They are prostrated.
Coroner Mehrmann took charge of
the case. An inquest will be held at
the residence.
Mrs. Danforth was married about
four years ago. She was 2S years old,
a native of this State. No children
survive. Besides her father and her
mother, Mrs. Danforth leaves two sis
ters. Mrs. Olive Reed Cushman, a tal
ented singer, and Mrs. Howard Swales
of this city, and a brother, Elmer Reed,
who is in mercantile business in Alas
ka. George W. Reed, the attorney of
this city, who was a delegate to the
Republican National Convention, is an
uncle of Mrs. Danforth. The funeral
arrangements have not been made.
The body was removed to another
apartment as soon as Collins had ex
tinguished the fire.
Â° It appeared as if Mrs. Danforth in
fallir.K had struck her head on a cor
ner of the bathtub and had been ren
dered unconscious and helpless to save
herself, even if the shock from the
blazing oil had not accomplished that
result. For a long time the unfortun
ate victim had been in ill health. Only
a week ago she returned from Fabiola
Hospital, where she had been under
treatment for nervous prostration,
fro^n which she had long suffered. Her
weakened condition contributed to pre
vent resistance when the severe shock
of the sudden explosion overcame her.
Odor of smoke and the heat from
burning woud alarmed the servant,
who tried to open the bathroom door.
It would not yield. Failing to get re
eponse to her call. Mrs. Hawtrey ran
for assistance. E. A. Collins, an ex
pressman, was driving by with a com
panion. He* answered and the men
rushed into the house, up to the bath
room and smashed in the door. A
burst of smoke and hot air nearly
stifled them, but they quickly revived,
only to see the prostrate form of Mrs.
Danforth. horribly burned, lying on
the floor. Her body rested in such a
position that it had fcarred the door.
The woodwork was all scorched and
burning from the oil that was spread
about the apartment.

At. the- conclusion of a suit to-day
before Judge Greene in which Mrs. N.
Anderson of Alameda was trying to
oust one John Palmer and a family by
the name of Cox, living with him, from
her house at S015 Encinal avenue, Ala
meda, for the non-payment of rent, his
Honor said:
"This case is one of conspiracy, pure
and simple. Palmer and this family
have entered into a plot to beat this
woman out of her rent and after all
is said and done I have listened to
some of the rankest perjury ever given
in a court of justice."
Suit was brought against Palmer and
as a defense it was set up that the
wrong party had been 6ued and that
Mrs. Cox was the person who rented
the place. ! The testimony went to
throwing light upon the transactions
at the time the premises were rented.
The evidence was flatly contradicted
and at the end of the trial Judge
Greene gave Judgment for the plain
tiff in the sum of $400.
After a separation of six y^rs from
her two small children, Mrs. Mamie
Kolloster was' reunited to them to-day
and all started for Santa Barbara this
evening. They had been hidden away
for the last fc-ur years with the Ladles'
Relief Society here, while the mother
had been led to suppose by J. H. How
ard, the father, that they were in the
East. Mr. and. Mrs. Howard were di
vorced a number of years ago and the
mother married again and is now the
wife of H. H. Kolloster of Oxnard.
Since the divorce the paths of the
once husband and wife have gone
strangely apart. Her lines have been
laid in pleasant places and he has
turned squirrel hunter on the Fresno
plains. With him he keeps their eldest
child, a boy of twelve, but the other
two, a boy of ten and a girl of eight,
have been in the custody of the Relief
Society.
When the mother discovered where
the children were she immediately took
steps to obtain letters of guardianship.
She obtained the consent of her hus
band and then came here and filed her
petition with the court, stating that
the children were left to the care of
strangers while she was able and will
ing to give them a mother's attention.
The father arrived Just in time from
where notice of the matter had been
sent him. He came in his rough hunt
ing coat with his son, while the mother
and her recovered babes sat on the op
posite pid-j of the courtroom. The eldest
child went to talk to his younger
brother and sister and his mother, but
was taken away by the father as
though afraid he might also lose him.
After hearing the testimony in. the case
Judge Greene awarded the custody to
the mother and she left with her chil
dren this evening for the sc-uthern part
of the State.

A Coroner's jury yesterday fixed
the responsibility for the deaths of
Andrew Quinn and MichaeK'Grlffln
upon the dead men themselves. Grif
fin and Quinn were laborers in the
Lantry Bros.' quarry and were killed
on June 13 by a premature explosion
of Hercules powder. The verdict of
the Jury was that death had been
caused by shock following accidental
amputation of both legs of both men
and that the explosion occurred by
reason of their own carelessness in
handling: the powder. '

MARY JIURD'S INJURIES
CAUSE HER DEATH
EDWARD ATKINSON.
Regretting that r cannot accept your
Invitation, even If you desired me to do
so after the receipt of this letter," I re
main, yours very truly:
Under Accept conditions of heavy
losses they have of necessity advanced
the rates of premium. This advance has
been so much resisted, and is as yet so
insufficient, to ,mÂ»et the increasing haz
ard of conflagration, that several of the
foreign companies are largely reducing
their risks; and the penalty has at
length fallen where it belongs, on the
owners and occupants of property in the
congested districts of cities. They will
be no longer able to buy contracts of in
demnity at less than cost.
Under these conditions they may at
length learn that the fault lies with
them, and that the only remedy rests
with themselves.
In response to an invitation from
some Toronto picrcliants who were
dissatisfies with the increase of in
surance rates there to visit Toronto
and deliver an address upon the in
surance problem, Edward Atkinson
wrote as follows:
-Dear Sir: I appreciate very fully the
compliment which you have extended to
me on behalf of the Association
to visit your city and to address
you on the subject of Insurance. If
there were no other reason, my advanced
age now forbids my accepting such in
vitation, requiring- a somewhat long rail
way Journey and considerable expendi
ture of physical strength.
But there are other reasons why my
address (were I to make one) would not
conduce to your satisfaction. The re
cent conflagrations are the normal re
sults of the continued neglect of the
owners and occupants of the buildings In
the congested districts of cities to take
suitable measures for the prevention of
loss by fire by a^doptinp, safer methods
of construction and suitable care in oc
cupancy. These conflagrations are but
the normal results, long anticipated, re
currinj? with increasing frequency, as
they will continue to r'ecur until the
owners and occupants of the buildings
give even a moderate attention to their
own duty, to their own property.
The larger part of such buildings have
been constructed without the slightest
attention being given to the danger of
the rapid spread of fire; in very many
cases they supply examples" of what I
have called "the art of combustible
architecture," which seems to have been
conducted as if owner, architect and
builder alike were providing for the
largest possible loss by fire from the
least possible cause, and in most cases
the occupancy is marked by neglect of
the commonest precautions for safety.
In recent years the stock insurance
comr'anies have in many places estab
lished systems of inspection, and have
endeavored to give instructions that
would lead to greater safety. How have
they been met? Simply in most cases as
if they were meddlesome persons who
might be put off with many shams, and
whose precautions, after the inspectors
have left, are totally neglected. They are
looked upon rather as persons who are
trying to get premiums out of the own
ers and occupants of property without'
rendering any corresponding service.
Under these conditions and in spite of
every effort, of the stock. underwriter to
change them the insurance of properly
in <:ltl?s against loss by tire has been
for many years unprofitable. The in
surance corporations have been saved
from bankruptcy only by their posses
sion of capital and of reserves previous
ly accumulated, and by th^ interest re
covered from the premiums during the
year in which they, are in their posses
sion. Their profits, where they have
made any. have been realized in their
function as bankers more than offsetting
the losses on their fire business.
ATKINSON^'ON CONGESTED DIS
TRICTS.
Htitton's Case Transferred.
Presiding Judge Graham yesterday
transferred from Judge Cook's court
to Judge Troutt's the hearing of . the
accusation of Mary Doran, a Dupont
street woman; who asks for the re
moval of Police Commissioner Hutton
from office on the ground that he
caused her arrest without a warrant.
Judge Cook is out of the city, and the
statutes require that accusations of
this sort must be heard within twen
ty days. The transfer of the case was
made to Judge Troutt upon represen
tations that Judge Cook would be
unable to'hear it.
Operation for Appendicitis.
George W. Montieth, the attorney,
residing at 70S Turk street, was tak
en suddenly ill three days ago. Tho
doctors diagnosed his case as acute
appendicitis. He was operated on last
night at St. Joseph's Hospital by Sur
geons J. A. Simpson and Alexander S.
Tuchler. He was Â«asy after the op
eration, but the jdoctors report his
case a very serious one.
White Swan 3Iines Co. Complains
That Promoter Took Certificates
Without Rlsht.
Letson Balliet. mining promoter. Is
again called into the courts to an
swer for his actions In connection
with the shares of a company in
which he was interested as an officer.
The -White Swan Mines Co. (Limited)
yesterday filed a complaint In the
Superior Court against Balliet, alleg
ing that he was an organizer of the
company and a subscriber for 275,
000 shares of its stock, for which he
had never paid. The complaint re
cites that Balliet was president of the
company on March 20, 1904, and K.
G. Shea was assistant secretary.
On March 21 both Balliet and
Shea, It is alleged, resigned their po
sitions, but on the following day Bal
liet, according to the complaint,
caused to be issued 20.000^hares of
stock in his own name and 133.000
shares in the name of Florence Bal
liet, as trustee, the certificates of each
issue bearing the date of March 21.
The company not only alleges that
the shares were issued after Balliet
and Shea had resigned their offices,
but that Balliet had never paid for
them either iii labor or property. It
is declared that Balliet represents the
certificates of stock as valid. The
company ask.s the court to restrain
him from disposing of them.
GARDENER DIKS UNDER
PECULIAR CIRCUMSTANCES
Sydney Johnson, Employed by Mrs.
F. N. Woods, Is Found Uncon
scious in His Bed.
Sydney Johnson, a gardener in the
employ of Mrs. F. N. Woods of 2000
California street, died under suspi
cious circumstances yesterday at the
Central Emergency Hospital. John
son was found unconscious in his bed
Monday morning by Mrs. Woods. Dr.
E. L. Perrault was called In and after
making a hurried examination said
the man was suffering from apoplexy.
Johnson was taken to the Emergency
Hospital, where he died yesterday.
Dr. Stevens of the hospital says the
patient's symptoms resembled those of
poisoning. The stomach was sent to
the City Chemist. 'Â¦',:, 'Â¦'Â¦_
Johnson had been employed at the
Woods residence for three months. He
was at one time quite wealthy, hav
ing made considerable money in the
Klondike. He met with reverses. Mrs.
Woods says that since that .time he
has been much depressed. Last Sun
day he became insnne and was taken
to the Emergency HospitaJr but soon
recovered his senses and was released.
The Coroner's officials believe he took
poison while despondent.
and pleaded kleptomania, produced
proof that she had spent two and a half
years in the Mendocino Asylum for the
Insane and Judge Mogan transferred
her to the keeping of Mr3. Lance, the
matron of that institution.
Mr?. Lizzie Boydston and her sister.
Miss Agne3 Murray, told Judge Fritz
of how the former lady's gold watch
was stolen from a trunk in her apart
ment at 259 Turk street, and why they
suspected that J. E. Drlscoll, a twenty
year-old, was the thief. The watch
was found in a pawn shop and restored
to Mrs. Boydston. The defense will be
heard next Tuesday.
â¢ â¢ ' â¢ *
John Magulre t a deaf-mute, was ac
commodated with six months' impris
onment for beating his aged mother at
her home, 16S Tehama street. . Patrol
man Tillman testified that the defend
ant had freely used his fists on the old
lady's face. The defense was lntoxica-.
tion.
"I'm as tough as I look^ f shouted
Richard McGee, as he paraded Bryant
street, near Fourth. '"'There's a chip on

who is tougher than he looks, not onry
knocked off the chip, but subjected Mr.
McGee to the ignominy of arrest. Sen
tence to-day by Judge Mogan.
Henry M. Blum was no sooner re
leased from the County Jail at the ex
piration of his term for vagrancy than
he was arrested on an old warrant
charging felony embezzlement, and
when he appeared before Judge Fritz
Ms face bore a striking resemblance to
a butcher's block in active service. He
explained that the scratches and
bruises were inflicted by a fellow
prlconer, who attacked him without
provocation on the eve of his release
and that he wanted a warrant issued
against his assailant for battery. When
it was further explained that the ac
cused prisoner will not be released un
til July 22 Blum's case was continued
unti! : that date, and he will spend the
interim at the old home on Broadway.
H. S. Parks and Thomas McMahon
were charged with waylaying Louis
Young near the International Hotel
and robbing him of a gun metal watch
and $2. â '
"What kind of a watch did you say?"
inquired his Honor Mogan, involun
tarily dipping his finger Into his
tenantless fob.
"Gun metal," Answered Clerk Grey.
Then the bench seemed to lose about
thirty-three and one-third per cent of
its interest in the. case, explainable,
perhaps, by the fact that the watch
of which it was surreptitiously relieved
last Saturday at San Rafael was of
yellow metal.
Defendants Parker and McMahon
were then instructed as to their rights
and the case was set for hearing to
morrow. -They are young in years and
apparently amateurs in footpadism.
Raffaeldo Belli, a teamster, was fined
$10 / by Judge Fritz for orally abusing
Mrs. Josic Hares when she protested
against His steering of his horses and
wagon over the sidewalk fronting her
residence at 421 Eighth avenue. Miss
G. H. Reins, a neighbor of the com
plainant, corroborated her testimony.
M. S. Cook, the Los Angeles sport
who consumed $400 worth of automobil
ing at the rate of $5 an hour without
stopping for anything else but refresh
ments, will probably succeed in settling
his case out of court. That was the
impression created by yesterday's pro
ceedings in Judge Mogan's court, where
a continuance of the hearing till to-day
was asked for and granted.
Lizzie Johnson, who was arrested
for vagrancy and then recognized by
the- detectives as one of the shrewdest
pickpockets in this or any other coun
try, pleaded guilty to the former charge
before Judge Fritz. Captain of Detec
tives Martin was then sent for and at
his request the defendant was dis
missed on the condition that she im
mediately leave the city and never re
turn to it. Â¦ i :-
C. W. Keye9 of Berkeley,- who came
to the city and treated some of his lady
friends to $20 worth of automobiling
and then referred the chauffeur, to the
Brltlf h consulate for payment, will have

Mogan. His Britannic Majesty's repre
sentative at this port, disclaims knowl

geatleman has been moving in the col

In conformity with a regulation of

Ancient Mortgage Revived.
A mortgage musty with its sixteen
years of age was revived in the Su
perior Court yesterday in the applica
tion of Samuel Shear for letters of
administration upon the estate of Al
fred D. Green. y who died February 1,
IS 98. Shear is the husband of Fran
cisco Aolita Amado Shear, widow of
the deceased Green. His application
says that the Â» heirs* of the Green es

mortgage dated September 6, 18S4, by
which William G. Jones was Indebted

Champion Bootblack Will
Never Again Handle
the Brushes.
Cornelius Lyons did his work in that
fashion. The little bootblack stand
will remain, but the champion will
never handle his brushes again.
The deceased leaves a wife, a son
and six daughters. He was a native
of Ireland. The funeral will take
place to-day from his late residence,
34 8 Fremont street.
"the champion bootblack of the world,
and I'll stay a bootblack till I die.
Let every man do his work, and do it
for all that is in him."
For the first time in many years the
little bootblack stand on Brook street
is closed. The little gray-haired pro
prietor, who was as i.roud of the title
of champion bootblack as an Emperor
of his diitdeni. never ply his trade
again. Death has called him.
In the early 'TO's Cornelius Lyons
first established his stand. Those were
the mad years of the stock excite
ment. While lie blacked the boots of
the Mackays, Fairs and Floods, Lyons
at times heard bits, of conversation
that meant the making and losing of
millions. He used these bits of infor
mation to his advantage. At one time
his family was In the habit of visiting
him in a victoria and he was as proud
of his position as if he had been the
president of a bank.
The quarters, halves and dollars
that he gathered â money was plentiful
in this period of madness â -he staked
in that -magnificent gambling game â
mining stocks. At one time the turn
of a hair would have made him as rich
as his most affiuent patron. While he
lost much he retained enough to live
in comfortable retirement had he
chosen to do so. But he never forsook
his stand. To the day of his death he
wore a belt proclaiming himself cham
pion bootblack and challenged the
world to take away the title. A city
grew about him, fortunes were made
and lost, the ranks of his first patrons
thinned and new ones came, but Cor
nelius Lyons stuck to his stand.

Young also ran a tontine business
and onoÂ»of his victims in that branch
is Mrs. Tubbs, who lives at the Gait
House. She was induced by .Young to
invest $500 on the agreement that at
the end of forty weeks she should draw
triple that amount. It was a few days
before the forty weeks- expired that
Young fled from the city..
His present residence was made
known by Mrs. Miller, who was his
bookkeeper. About two weeks ago she
suggested to Mrs. Johnson that as
Young was now in business in New
York it would help him materially and
ultimately add to MÂ». Johnson's
wealth, if Mrs. Johnson should loan
Young $15,000. Mrs. Johnson consulted
Attorney Maguire and he told her to
humor Mrs. Miller and ascertain, if
possible. Young's present address. This
was done. On Monday Mrs. Miller fur
nished Mrs. Johnson with thex-a'ddress
and yesterday the warrant was sworn
out before Judge Conlan for Young's
arrest. As soon as he
an officer will be sent to bring him
back.
A warrant was issued yesterday by
Police Judge Conlan for the arrest of
James F. Young on a charge of felony,
embezzlement. The complaining wit
ness is Mrs. Sarah E. Johnson, pro
prietress of the Gait House at Market
street and Golden Gate avenue. The
amount alleged in the complaint is $500,
but Mrs. Johnson's attorney,, W. M.
Maguire, says the total reaches JSOOO.
Young has been traced to New York
and Captain Martin has wired to the
police authorities there to _place him
under arrest."
Young disappeared from the city last
April, leaving a large number of dupes,
most of â¢ them women, to mourn his
Eutiden departure. He posed as presi
dent of the Columbian Mutual. Com
mission Company when Mrs. Johnson
became acquainted with him. He
claimed to .have offices In the Starr
King building.
Mrs. Johnson was induced at various
times to give him sums aggregating
$8000 for investment irf his company,
which he alleged was a paying con
cern and returned large dividends. She
paid 55000 of the amount by check to
Attorney Mayo- of the Crossley build-
Ing and the other $3000 in cash at dif
ferent times to Young, the -last pay
ment of $500 .being made on January
15. Mrs. Johnson received nothing
from Young, who disappeared from the
city last April.

The foregoing entries, written with
an indelible pencil in the pocket diary
cf N. B. Manning, explain wljy he took
his life with carbolic acid. It was on
board the steamer Captain Weber
some time last Monday night that the
deed was done. The steamboat ar
rived from Stockton yesterday fore
noon, and when a deckhand went to
Manning's stateroom to rouse him
Manning lay dead In his bed. The
steamboat officials presumed that
death had resulted from natural
causes, but Deputy Coroner Michael
Brown found the odor of carbolic acid
in a drinking glass in the stateroom.
The 'jottle which had contained the
poison had doubtless been thrown
overboard.

Mary Taylor, who stole a dress skirt
from a Market street dry/goods store
John Bowers, the oldest offender of
the bunch, had no acceptable plea
ready and was sentenced to six months.
M. J. Mulcahey said he came to the
city from Crockett to have a raging
tooth removed. The pain of the molar
drove him to drink and he was arrest
ed while en route to a dentist. Five
days.
Henry Brown (colored) came from a
construction camp on the North Pa

was "pinched." "Ah doan want no at

Walter Wilson, a veteran in vagran

Six male vagrants, arrested at as

William Scheamely, convicted of
stealing four Ivory billiard balls from
a' saloon, was given thirty days by
Judge Fritz. &?&
When he was accused of stealing a
woman's skirt from a basement on
Buchanan street John Holly hastily
pleaded guilty and requested Judge Mo
gan to sentence him immediately, as he
did not desire to give the overworked
court any more trouble than was ab
solutely necessary. His considerateness
aroused suspicion, however, and sen
tence was postponed till yesterday, the
police being Instructed to investigate
his character. So when he reappeared
before the bench there were several
prior convictions for larceny laid up
against him and he was promptly sen
tenced to five months.
/Murray has served six months for
beating his mother and several lesser

William Murray, arrested for disturb

nine months by Judge Mogan. Rosie
Ritch. a tailoress, was sent to prison
for three months. The couple were
arrested la^st Saturday night in the
Nevada House, on Sixth street, where
they consorted, and the woman's hus
band, a meek-looking little man, testi
fied that he was beaten by Murray,

jected to having his wife's affections
alienated.
In holding the defendant the court
took occasion to r compliment Patrol
man Wren â¢*for" r 'hls "â¢promptness and
courage in arresting Burnell while the
latter â¢ had a revolver pointed at
him. Motorman Keyes, whose refusal
to stop the car when commanded by
the defendant resulted in the capture,
was also the recipient of eulogistic
mention from the bench.
Gert Burnell, charged . with holding
up an Eddy street car and robbing the
conductor of J1S, was held to the Su

bail. fixed at '$5000, which was not fur

Unnecessarily violent handlings of
prisoners by policemen was the " sub
ject of an interesting homily delivered
yesterday In open court by Judge Mo
gan. His remarks were prompted by
the complaint of Fred Atkinson and
John Bohn, two respectable-looking
young fellows who were arrested on
Saturday evening at Second and Fol
som,streets and charged with disturb
ing \he peace. When their case was
called on Monday they alleged they
had been brutally treated by Officers
Jvruser and* Rice, and thÂ«?ir case was
continued till yesterday, in order to
glve"the accused opportunity to tell
their side of the storv. Atkinson said
that RTte deliberately and unpro
vokedly struck his face three times
with a clenched fist, blackening one of
his eyes, and the discolored optic
was shown as evidence of the assault.
Bohn asserted that Kruger had prod
ded him in the side with a club until
his body was"bruised,and sore.
The two policemen denied, having
used undue* violence in their treatment
of the prisoners, but they'acknowl
edged that 1 there was no "provocation
for rough usase, as the boys did not
resist, arrest, j
"I micht have collided with Atkin
son, "said Hlce, .'/but I did not wil
fully blacken his eye."
"If these boys were beaten as they
allege," said the" Judge, "the act was
both brutal and cowardly. I am not
saying their complaint is true, for I
have only their statement as opposed
by the officers they accuse; but I
would like to have it understood that
any policeman who is convicted, be
fore me of having maltreated an un
resisting prisoner will be punished as
severely as the law permits. These de
fendants do not seem to be vicious
boys, and their youth and compara
tively weak physical condition
would brand as e -coward the
man, in or out of uniform, who
would beat them as they al
lege they were beaten. Their arrest
in the first place was ill advised, for
the testimony shows they were not re
sponsible for the peace disturbanceâ â¢
the firing of a toy bombâ that attract
ed the officers' attention to them. The
charge against them is dismissed."

slump In play-going as the metropolis
now Is experiencing. Failure has fol

"The 'great financial combines' is' a phrase the mean
ing of which is not entirely clear. We assume, how
ever, that it is intended to mean the principal financial
interests of Wall street; that is, those people who are
engaged principally in the practice of .finance, which
consists, essentially, in selling' securities to the public.
Of course, when a sale is made of anything by one
person to another, the assumption is that each i\ satis
fied with his., bargain and that each derives benefit
therefrom. . Many of the securities manufactured and
sold by the great' financial interests are good securities
and sold to the public at a fair price, so that the public
has received benefit from their purchase. It would be,
however, the duty of the organ of the 'great financial
combines,' if there were such a thjng, to, do all in its
power to induVe the public to buy any and all securities
offered by these people,,) regardless of merit. Such" a
newspaper would be false to its trust in doing so. It is
the duty of a. newspaper dealing with financial matters
to, consult- first ,the v interests of its rtadcrs in all such

by the possession of the skulls of cel

regarded as a genuine relic â has been
again "discovered." It Is said that the
skull of Richelieu likewise lacks a
decent burial. Just as the remains
of the great ' Protector were disin
terred and subjected to every kind of
posthumous Indignity at the restora
tion, so. during the reign of terror,
the grave of the mighty Cardinal was
desecrated and the head severed from
the trunk, to be exposed to public

de Rothschild, for some time has pos

own equipment that excited the
envy of his wealthy neighbors, but re
cently he has supplemented it by the
addition of a motor fire engine and
can now boast that he has by long
odds the most "up-to-date and efficient
private fire department in the United

It is no wonder that the Baron
bought the best he could, for, besides
the palace in which he lives^he has to
protect the greatest private natural
history collection in the world, which
is the special hobbj' of his only son,
Walter. Although there is hardly an
animal above or below the earth of
which Walter Rothschild has no speci
men, the member of Parliament con
centrates most of his i=pare time and a
large share of his income on birds
and â his fleas. Only last August he
offered a reward of $5000 for a perfect
epecimen of tljo rl?a which makes life
Interesting for the Arctic fox. So far
as known, however, that particular
flea is still at large.
Nor is this "the only part of the col

Besides his numberless cabinets of
dead specimens in quarters of special

abound, many of them too wild to

Since the recent virulent outbreaks
of "booing" from the gallery gods a
first performance of a play In London
has become more a trying affair than
ever. And when the actor-manager
has a brand-new author into the bar
gain he can be pardoned for dropping
a good many, lines now and then
through nervousness. The â¢ production
of "The Edge of the Storms" meant a
good deal tp Forbes Robertson *at the
Duke of York's Theater this week,
for luck has not always been with him
of late; but it looks as If he could
count on a fair amount of success
for this venture. There was no "boo"
and there was much real enthusiasm
for Margaret Young's melodrama. The
plot deals with the effort of a' fiery
Hungarian girl to avenge the death
of her. father at the hands of a young
Englishman,' whom she had rescued
after her father had condemned him
to execution. She traces the supposed
murderer to India and then gets mar
ried to him without knowing that he
is the man who killed her father. But
at the. moment of the dread discovery
she learns that the deed had been com
mitted unawares, and love conquers

which, by the way, is the dress circle
one on the "prompt" side. And the
re ason is that at the beginning of "The
Earl and the Girl's" run three officers
of the fashionable "Guards" Regiment
took the box on speculation for a period
of six months at a rental of $13 a
night and since have been charging
practically what they like for its use
on such evenings as they are not oc;
cupying the place themselves. Forty,
forty-five and fifty dollars has been
paid by outsiders thus far for the
"Sammy" box, with the. result that the
"three Guardsmen" are flush. And
for some time they have been utilizing
no small part of their gains in acquir
ing attractive novelties, which â on the
nights when they are in possession of
the box â they throw or hand down to
the singers on the stage. Bouquets of
costly flowers \ are the least extrava
gant of these tokens. Dainty, fluffy
sunshades are among the more lasting
presents. At Eastertide twenty-six
huge egg? of satin containing beautiful
presents were passed over to the sing
ers, and once a small pet monkey was
sent clambering down from the box to
the stage as a gift. Even thiB was sur
passed, however, one night when, let
down by ropes, came a huge dog.ken
nel made of Parma violets in which
sat a valuable bulldog.
The "Sammy" box is as Interesting
to the audience as it is to the singers.
Three days before Eton, reopened re
cently the box was taken by ten
youthful Etonians, who had succeed
ed in outbidding all other competitors.
"Sammy," it may be remembered,
began Its history In America, when
Blanche Ring sang it in a piece called
the "Defender," which had been built
up erour.d the yacht race, and on
the night when Sir Thomas Lipton
went to see the piece addressed the
song to the box in which he sat. Last
November Miss Ring sang "Sammy"
at the Palace Theater in London, and
when the Savoy Theater' opened" with
"The Love Birds"* she sang it again,
and on the second night of the piece
two men were so enthralled with
"Sammy", that they leaped from their
box to the stage.

Pounds sings "Sammy" surrounded by

"Another case I recollect happened
in one of the big hotels where an alarm
of fire was given. On going through
the rooms to locate the source of the
fire I caught sight of a portly gentle
man just as he was rushing from his
room in his night dress and in his
hands he held a box of tooth powder,
a tooth brush, a towel and a bathing

sured the frightened man that there
was no danger and advised him to re

into his room. I complied, and to my
astonishment, lying on the bureau
within sight was a gold watch, diamond

Two numerously signed petitions have been presented
by citizens of Seattle within a fortnight, requesting im
mediate action, but without result, except in a small way.
One dairyman was ordered to open a closed sewer un
der a milk barn and to whitewash the Interior . of the
barn, and another dairyman has been compelled to put
his dairy in a sanitary condition. These are the only
results from several public hearings to* date, so far as
disclosed by the columns of the Times.
According to the same authority the State of Wash
ington is also tied up and unable to afford relief by mak
ing the necessary analyses because it has no laboratory.
Charges are confined to specific instances by the Times
which says: "The Board of Health and dairies will be
allowed to continue in their own way while children and
invalids drink milk known in one instance to come from
an unsanitary dairy and in another charged with being
unclean."
Â¦ The confession of the impotency of Seattle to protect
itself "against a manifest danger of grave size, that the
Times makes, accompanies other interesting statements
to the effect that it has been notorious that the law
governing the conduct of dairies has not been observed;
that this has been generally and publicly discussed and
not denied; and that Seattle made a mistake when it
let the contract for making bacteriological investiga
tions to a body that fails to work when it is most
needed.
It is gratifying that the Board of Health in this city
is doing better work than its associated body in Seattle,
but' there should be no relaxation in its endeavors.
Every person who dies in San Francisco by reason of
bad milk, which might easily have been kept from him
by the duly constituted authorities, and every person
whose health is undermined by bad milk, constitutes an
accusing' witness against all who are responsible either
through negligence or greed.
DISPLAYED under large headlines the Seattle
Times, makes a confession of a most astonishing
sort. The headlines are as follows/ shorn of
symmetrical spacing 1 and variegated samples of job
type: "Board abandons plan to clean dairies; Bacteri
ological investigation falls through before: it is started;
Citizens in petitions complain of two unclean milk
barns."
The Seattle City Board of Health proposed not long
ago, possibly stimulated by the stir in this city' relative
to the furnishing of polluted milk to the people of San
Franci?co, to make general bacteriological examinations
.of samples of all milk sold from dairy wagons in Seattle.
The purpose was to determine whether the milk is in
fected from unsanitary barns in. the county to the extent
that would cause a spread of disease.
On the face of this the proposition would seem to be
meritorious. The lives of the children of Seattle are un
questionably precious and the general health of the milk
drinking community is not less so. It appears that the
Kings County Medical Society receives $125 a month
from the city under contract to furnish an analytical
and bacteriological laboratory where all needed work
is to be performed. But the society, so says the Times,
''considers the work too large an undertaking and the
local Board of Health, which gave the contract to the
society, is not urging, therefore, that it shall be done."

THE Examiner devotes editorial space to the civil
disturbances in Colorado. > It is to be regretted
that it leaves unanswered our question, '-"What
was the duty of the State government in Colorado?"
The Examiner sums the situation up by saying: "It is
government by special interests, for special interests,
carried to its logical conclusion, that is on exhibition;"
The examination of the record will illuminate that
declaration. In the mining regions there was local gov- ,
ernment. In our complex system the local government
is the first to touch the citizen.* It is in first contact.
The local government is charged with the protection of
the rights of person and property, and the punishment of
all who violate them. It must protect the peace of all.
It must make every man secure in the right of private
contract, the fundamental property right. It must make
it safe for every man to cam his living in a lawful vo
cation. It must make the use of streets and highways
safe for the use of every citizen, on his way to work
and to his home. It must enforce the law in these re
spects against all who violate it.
TheÂ«e are the fundamental purposes of local govern
ment. Were they fulfilled in the disturbed districts in
Colorado? Was" every man safe in the performance of
his private contract? Were the 'rights "of person and
property respected? ! Were the streets and highways
safe for the use of all 'on lawful errands?
The answer by the record is no! xThe Miners' Federa
tion disrespected the rights of person and property. It
made the streets and highways unsafe. It denied the
right of private contract and enfofced its denial by the.
death penalty. ' It arrested and deported from the dis
trict, under circumstances of exceptional inhumanity,
over a hundred citizens, murdering several in the pro
cess, whose offense consisted in standing upon their
right of private contract. It forbade any. one to do any
form of business in the district except under its dictation
and under the badge of submission to it. In enforcing
this policy it killed half a hundred men. Mine owners
and superintendents were assassinated. Mine workers
were shot down, going from their homes to their work,
or from their work to their homes.
There was present all of the machinery of local gov
ernment. That government was charged with the duty
of enforcing equality of right and equality of safety.
But its officers were either members of the Miners' Fed
eration or were elected by it and subservient to it. It
simply recorded the decrees of that federation and gov
erned for it and for none other. The federation was a
special interest. The local government, in the language
of the Examiner, was "government by a special inter
est and for a special interest carried to a logical conclu
sion," by holding -all rights for that special interest
alone and denying all rights to everybody else.
Now it is pleaded in extenuation of this collapse of
local government that the Legislature failed to pass an
eight-hour law under the dictate of a referendum. The
article of Ray Stannard Baker, in McClure's, on the
subject has misled the country as to the validity of that
provocation. The record fact is that in that district
there had been an eight-hour day. for ten years, and
in most of the smelters for five years. If the^Lcgislaturc
had passed an eight-hour law neither the mine owners,
nor the Miners' Federation would have been in the least
affected by. it, for they had it already, and had had it
for years. Nor was any question of wages in issue. The
only issue was the right of the Miners' Federation to
replace civil government, strike down the right of con
tract, and destroy the guarantees of the constitution,
and maintain in an American State a district divorced
and separated from its system of civil law, where no
right of civil liberty was permitted. On the record made
by the federation and the State no other issue appears.
The list of black crimes committed in the establish
ment of that form of government is of indelible record.
If the State had remained supine, then the mining re
gion of Colorado would have been in fact permanently
separated from the State government. It would have
ceased to be governed by the laws of the State, or of
the United States. It would have been a civic mon
strosity, a place with no law but the arbitrary will of
the secret circle of the Miners' Federation.
Again, we ask the critics of Governor Peabody to
say what he should have 'done under the circumstances.
If they say that he should have done nothing, then
they advocate the overthrow of civil liberty and stand
in denial of the right of a State to prevent it. The
course of Governor Peabody is not without precedent.
When the Mormon community at Nauvoo became a law
unto itself, exactly like the Miners' Federation in Colo
rado, local government failed. The Governor of Illi
nois, using the militia, deported the whole Mormon com
munity, sent them out of the State and forbade their re
turn. It is not to the question that this deportation,
furnished instances of crying inhumanity. No one
questioned the fight of the Governor to use the only
remedy in his hands to get rid of people who had sepa
rated themselves from the civil State and erected a
theocracy in its place.

things, and -such a newspaper could not be called an
'organ of the combines.'"
This is rather enigmatical. A vast volume of securi
ties manufactured by the great financial combines were
not valid securities. That is to say, they were not based
upon productive assets capable of returning to the buy
ers the profit in- dividends that was reasonably expected
when they bought. The newspapers which speak for
the combines charge this lack of profit to the buyer
upon President Roosevelt, because he enforced the law
against the combines that manufactured securities. . Of
course good securities suffered . by impingement upon
the bad. But that is no reason for trie argument that
the President did wrong in enforcing the law.
It was because we saw in the Journal evidences of
enmity to the President that could have no other cause
than his enforcement of the law tfyat we call it an
"organ!" It denies that it is an "organ," and we leave
it to say just what sort of an instrument plays the tune
in which it so often indulges. '*

Answers to Queries,
Spiritualism we have always with
us, but every now and then it crops
up with peculiar intensity, generally as
a result of some wonderful manifesta
tion which puzzles the multitude.
Among these manifestations spirit
photographs are especially powerful,
for, as the unskilled in photography
say, if the spirits were not there how
could they appear in the print? On
this subject an expert has written a
most interesting article in "Pho
tography," purely from a professional
standpoint. He points out no fewer
than thirteen peculiarities of "spirit
photographs," among them that the
"spirit form" Js in many cases "lit"
from the opposite side to the sitter,
and that the "spiritual" part of the?^
photographs is characterized by ins
peculiar degradation of tone values
well known to and easily recognized
by photographers . as resulting from
copying a photograph: and that many
"spirit faces" bear unmistakable evi
dence of the interposition at soms
stage of the process of a half-tone
screen. The result of these and other
considerations is summed up by the
writer in the statement that the judi
cially skeptical investigator can havÂ»
no hesitation in his decision that some
where or other in the production of
these photographs there has been de
liberate, intentional and very clumsy
trickery.

Editor The Call: According to a re
port in your valued paper the Rev.
Jefferson E. Scott gave an address be
fore the members of the Methodist Min
isters' Association on the subject of
"Unveiled Hinduism," and in reply to
questions undertook to compare Chris
tian Science with the Vedant philoso
phy. "While Dr. Scott may be familiar
with Hinduism, it Is certain that his
knowledge of Christian Science is very
limited, for what he calls the "simi
larity between them" does not exist.
The teaching "that by mental ab
straction and Yogi practices there may
be entire exemption from all human
ills" has no place in Christian Science,
and the explanation that a Yogi "is one
who seeks to entirely obliterate all his
faculties and senses by acts of pen
ance" Indicates the great difference be
tween such practice and that of Chris
tian Science.
Christian Science is the spiritual un
derstanding of Christianity as taught
and demonstrated by Christ Jesus and
has nothing in common with the, licen
tious rites and practices which Dr.
Scott attributes to Hinduism. Our
Master said to his disciples, "Ye shall
know the truth, and the truth shall
make you free," and It is only through
knowing this truth concerning God and
man's true relation to Him and obedi
ence to God's spiritual law that exemp
tion from human ills can be obtained.
The practice of Yogism is as repugnant
to Christian Scientists as it is to other
Christians and has no connection what
ever with Christian Science. Sincereiy
yours. FRANK W. GALE.

The fact that Mayor Schrnitz vetoed
the appropriation of $1200 for an ex

pervisors and the veto was sustained
will not deter the board from at
tempting to make the appointment.
Supervisor Braunhart yesterday or

but the money will come either from
the urgent necessity fund or from the

as vetoed.
In all likelihood the Mayor will

No Trace Found of Roslng^r.
In his opinion Judge Murasky dis
cusses the merits of the case, saying
tht there is no city in the country
where conditions are *o peculiar as
they are here. In a city of so many
wooden structures, he says, the mov
ing of houses is not infrequent and on
the other hand there is no city with
such an extensive railway system and
lines interlacing so completely. The
Judge held that the company had a
rig-ht to maintain its wires and the
movers to move houses, but it must
be considered which right . is para
mount. Where the moving of houses
would result in immeasurable loss by
interfering with the travel of a great
number of people an injunction would
lie, but where the damage inflicted by
cutting wires is measurable an in
junction could not be enforced.
The court requires that the defend
ants stipulate that they will only move
houses at times most convenient to the
railroads.
Judge Murasky yesterday denied the
application of the United Railroads
for an injunction preventing D. J.
Sullivan and other house movers from
cutting the company's wires or ob
structing railway trafic in moving
houses. The court requires the house
movers to supply a sufficient bond in
demnifying the company against dam
age from their necessary acts and or
ders that no wires should be cut ex
cept by the company or under its su
pervision.

sixteen hours,' compelled her to take
off her clothing and searched her.
She sa>-3 she was subjected to other
gross indignities and humiliation and

A new move is In prospect in the
legal battle between the owners of
houses on Belden place, used for Im
moral purposes, and the Police De
partment, backed up by the city. Yes
terday the suit of E. Lozior and six
other proprietors of the houses men
tioned against Chief of Police Witt
man, Captain of Police Duke and
Mayor Schmitz for an injunction was
dismissed by the plaintiffs as against
Wittman and Duke without prejudice
to another action. This dissolves the
temporary restraining order against
the police, by which they were pre
vented from, continuing their raids of
the houses.
It was alleged in the complaint of
the proprietors that the police officers
had conspired to "wreck the lodging
house business by entering the places
and dragging the inmates to jail." In
affidavits in answer the police declar
ed that Belden place was In the heart
of the city and near to hotels and the
aters and that the houses therein were
used as places of improper resort.

James Neill will begin a starring- en
gagement with a matinee next Sunday
at the Grand Opera-house. He will be
supported by Edythe Chapman and the
original Neiil company, which is com
posed of artists of acknowledged abili

pleasure, as he brings a repertoire of
modem plays and mounts them lavish
ly. For his opening week he has se
lected one of his greatest successes,
Clyde Fitch's patriotic drama, "Bar
bara Frietchie.' The production will
be the best ever given the play here,
as the immense resources of the Grand
Opera-house stare will admit of effects
impossible at the smaller theaters in
which it has hitherto been given. There
will be an extra matinee on Monday,
July 4.

"This commission now desires to say
tbat if. x on or before Tuesday next.
July 5. at which time our next regular
meeting will be heid. the information
requested frcm rour honorable board
regarding street sweepers is not re
ceived this department will proceed
without further delay and will set an
examination for street sweepers, bas
ing it uron such information as we
may be able to obtain without the
knowledge we have sought from your
department."
The Civil Service Commission also
sent a communication to the Board of
Supervisors In reply to a request for
information, saying that appointments
for inspection, superintendence and
supervision of the cleaning of streets
could be made from the lists of field
deputies and inspectors of complaints,
but it does not know if the lists are
available, because the Board of" Works
has failed to give the necessary in
formation as to the duties of the po
sitions.
The Civil Service Commission sent a
communication to the Board of Works
yesterday saying that its letter ask
.ing for information regarding street
sweepers, so that a proper basis may
be had upon which to formulate an ex
amination for arplicants, has not been
answered. The communication con
tinues:
It is proposed to employ 175 sweepers,
comprising the gangs now working for
the contractors. Five inspectors will
also be employed to supervise the
T\ork. These latter will not be taken
from the civil service list until the
plan is in working order. The work
will be largely experimental during
July and after that the civil sen-ice
list cf field deputies will be drawn on
fcr inspectors.
In making preparations fcr the city
to do its o^rn street cleaning during
the fiscal year beginning next Friday
the Board of Public Works contem
plates to do more sprinkling than w*3
heretofore done .by the contractors.
Chief Clerk Booker was in consulta
tion yesterday with Commissioners
Schmitz and Maestretti. Maestretti
made a f.at offer of 550OO for water to
he used in sprinkling the streets for one
year. Eleven sr^rinklin^ carts will be
employed for the purpose.
The Board of Works also plans to
fush the streets, thus doing away with
sweeping in some instances. This will
result in obviating the complaints
apainst Crtng dust which have beÂ«n so
numerous under the contract plan.
General MacArthur will inspect the

6, for the Henry ranch, in San Luis
Obispo County, whera. the big maneu
vers are to take place in August. They
will be about twelve days in making
the trip. On arrival there the Field
Artillery, under command of Major
Edward J. Brown, will hold their an
nual target practice. As soon as the
cavalry arrive on the scene they will
begin the work of getting the rench
ready for the reception of the main
body of United States troops and the
troops of the National Guard who are
to take part in the maneuvers.
The transport Buford will sail Fri
day at noon for Alaskan ports. She
will be loaded to her full capacity. She
takes the Third Infantry. This includes
4T officers, SIS enlisted men. 20 officers*
wives and IT children, also 30 second
class passengers. In her hold there
will be eight carloads of merchandise,
being the effects of the officers and en
listed men.
STOVES AND REFRIGERATORS.
She will also carry a big amount -of
provisions, including a supply of stoves
and 21 refrigerators. It would seem at
a glance that taking refrigerators to
Alaska would be an absurdity, but they
are. however, a very necessary commo
dity for the comfort of those residing
in that section- Though the winters
are cold, bleak and drear, the summers
are excessively hot.
The troops are carrying all their
household effects, as they expect to be
stationed In Alaska for two years at
least. The freight is bulky rather than
weighty.
Captain William H. Patterson, Twen
ty-eighth Infantry, one of the officers

He was superintending the adjustment

GOES TO AMERICAN LAKE.
Stale eggs and rancid butter were
not to the liking of the inmates of the
Napa Asylum, according to the state
ment of the board of managers of that
institution in its answer filed yesterday
to the complaint of the A. L. Lundy
Company. This is one of the reasons
given by the managers as an excuse
for awarding the contract for furnish
ing butter, cheese and eggs for the en
suing year to another firm, notwith
standing the contention of the Lundy
Company that its bids were the lowest.
In regard to the charge of Lundy
that the contract was illegally aVard
ed to Wheaton. Pond & Harold be
cause the latter's bids were not signed
or identified until after the others were
opened, the managers answer that it
was asreed by all the o*:her bidders,
including the Lundy Company, that
ths bids in question and those of an
other firm should be signed before the
bids were considered.
The asylum authorities aver that
Lundy's bid was not in proper form
In that he did not submit samples of
the articles to be supplied, as required.
In contending that at no time on the
dates mentioned was the Lundy Com
pany a responsible bidder, the man
agers aver that no reliance could be
placed upon the firm to furnish
articles of the grade demanded. It is
said that the firm furnished supplies
to the asylum during the year 1302-03,
but that the butter was short in
weight, poor in quality and at times
unfit for human consumption, and that
the eggs were stale and bad and nu
merous complaints were made about
them, but no attention was paid to the
complaints by the firm. Much of the
stuff supplied, it is said, was not used.
The firm received the contract to fur
nish fresh ranch butter In the year
1303-04, but, instead, furnished butter
which was stale and unsatisfactory.
Complaints were made on five speci
fied dates against the quality of the
butter, but the firm, it is alleged, paid
no attention.
The board says It acted wiselv, dis
creetly and deliberately and after much
discussion in awarding the contract a3
it did, and declares that Its action
was for the best interest of the State
and the institution.

decided at the last moment to retain
any of these they will suffer a reduc

The rMuced appropriation will also
â¢ result in the doing away with one of

Beatrice Hinkle may be the unfortun

pressure is hems brought to bear to
have her retained.

'Chief Food Inspector Robertson is a

PORTLAND, June'28. â After being
tied with Portland three- times during
to-day's game the San Francisco men
went into the air when Yerkes took
the place of Whalen in the eighth" and
allowed four runs, thus losing by the
final score of 8 to 5. This placed San
Francisco three to the bad, but in the
ninth they filled the bases on three
safe hits. Irwin then sent a hot one
In to Raymond, Portland's new short
stop, and Meany went out at second.
Whalen had pitched a Â¦ good game,
only allowing the hits to be bunched
in the fourth inning, when Portland
made two run3. Three' hits were made
off Yerkes out of the first four men
at the bat, all three runners coming
home, owing to the loose work of the
San Francisco fielders following Ir
win's fumble of Iberg's grounder.
Baldwin and Meany led out in the
eighth for San Francisco with a three
bagger apiece, Meany scoring on
Townsend's well placed hit into cen
ter field. The score:

The presence in the Cornell 'varsity
eight-oared boat of two menâ the Foote
cousinsâ who had previously rowed in
the four-oared event added greatly to
the interest of the great race of the
day and led to allowances for her crew
in their defeat at the hands of Syra
cuse, though the two men saved them
selves to a great extent for this event.
Summary:
The weather was nearly perfect for
racing. Dashes of rain marred the en
joyment of the spectators somewhat
and a rather brisk southerly breeze to
ward the close of, the day made the wa
ter somewhat rough, to which the slow
time may be attributed.
POUGHKEEPSIB, N. Y.. June 28.â
Cornell's rowing supremacy is broken.
In the four-mile eight-oar 'varsity race
and In the freshman two-mile eight
oar race the Syracuse oarsmen won by
handsome margins^ coming out of ob
scurity so Viarked that last night the
friends of. Syracuse could not find
takers for their beis. Cornell won the
four-oar 'varsity race with ease.
"Wisconsin, which was thought to
threaten all competitors in the four
oar -and . 'varsity races, was never j a
factor, finishing next to last in the
four-oar race and last in the 'varsity.
Columbia, the "dark horse," whose
mysterious doings up stream have led
to a great deal of solicitude on the part
of all her competitors, did well in the
four-oar race, as she came in second.
She made but a feeble showing in the
others, coming in last in the freshman
race and fourth in the 'varsity.
Xo records were broken. Indeed, the
time was slower than for three years.
What might have been done in the
'varsity race had Cornell pr'essed Syra
cuse may be inferred from a statement
of the Syracuse coxswain to-night, in
which he is quoted as saying that his
men were prepared for a surprise from
Cornell in the last part of the race and
were ready for it with reserve power,
but they were not pressed in any part
of the race. '-". Â¦/

when Sheehan drove one to Flood.
The latter fielded well, but Chase
dropped the ball.
McDonald first called the runner
out, but later saw his mistake and re
versed his decision. St. , Vrain was
wild and presented the visitors with
their first two runs. Overall and Hall
pitched a magnificent battle for the re
maining ten innings. The college boy
had the better of it, keeping the hits
seattered. He was steady and struck
out ten. The whining run was brought
in by Casey. With one down he got a
base on balls and was advanced to the
plate by McLaughlin's double.
Tacoma fielded loosely, but fought a
game, uphill battle. In the ninth Los
Angeles had a chance to score, but
Flood struck out. With three men on
the bases In the twelfth Cravath was
unable to ge^ a hit. Chase and Ber
nard did some star fielding. Score:

SHEEPSHEAD BAY, June 28.â
James B. Haggin's giant , racehorse,
Waterboy, Â¦ made his first appearance
this year in the second race at the
Coney Island Jockey Club's course to
day and ran second to Captain S. S.
Brown's three-y'ear-old colt Broom
stick. The race was run in the fast
time of 1:SS 3-5 for one- mile. The
weights carried wer^ weight for age,
111 pounds on Broomstick and 128
pounds on Waterboy. John A. Drake's
Rapid Water, which ran third in the
American Derbr -on the 18th lnst., was
third to-day in the race won by Broom
stick. Reliable was last all the way.
These were the only starters, the con
ditions of the race being such as to
keep out all but the good horses, theve
being no allowances.
Not at all favorable to either Water
boy or Reliable was the weather, which
was cold and raw. Reliable is none too
sound in the wind and Waterboy might
have been better served with a warm
day. He looked fit, his quarters were
well muscled, the infallible indication
of a horse having had plenty of work.
While he was beaten, he ran a remark
ably good race for a horse which has
been reported more than once this year
to have bace adieu to the turf. Sum-
Broomstick Leads Out the
'Haggin Horse, Going the
Mile in 1:38 8-5.

The Government' asks JSOOO, which
would be about the retail price for the
wood and piles "cut within the last
year. The General Land Office refuses
to accept settlement on a basis of 25
cents per cord, as was done at Ram
pert and lower Yukon points last year.
The price charged by the Government
is $5 per cord for wood . and 9Vs cents
per foot for piling. The Government
claims the right to collect pay from
either those who cut timber or those
who consume it. All those concerned
hav j refused to pay th_ demands and
will make further presentation of their
case to the General Land Office.
TACOMA. Wash.. June 2S.â The Gen
eral Land Office has commenced to en
force its recent ruling that cutters of
timber in Alaska must pay full value
for the same. Through Receiver Mul-
Hn of the Juneau Land Office, formal
demands have been made on the Moore
Wharf Company and the Northwest
Light and Power Company, both of
Skagway, for payment of wood cut by
them.
Government Will Demand That Full
Price Must Be Paid for

"The cutting seems to have been
done with a dull knife. I can con
ceive of no reason why any one should
want to destroy the bag and I be
lieve the work was pure vandalism
with no other object in view but the
malicious destruction of property."
Walter B. Stevenson, secretary of
the World's Fair Company, said steps
would be taken to apprehend the van
dal and for the future protection of
the airship. .
When the damage was done the
shed that shelters the gas bag was
patrolled by a Jefferson guard and a
special watchman, who was one of
Mr. Dumont's employes. Neither saw
the vandal and the damage was not
discovered until the workmen were
about to take the bag from the box.
"I do not know," was the reply. "It
will be impossible to get a new bag
and if an ascension is made this one
must be repaired. I can think of no
reason why any one should want to
destroy my airship."
Professor Meyers, who made a care
ful examination of the cuts, said:
When the damage was discovered a
messenger was sent to Dumont and he
hurried to the scene. After examining
the bag he said:
"Wpll, it is Just as I told the fair
people. This place Is not secure
enough."
"What will you do?" he was asked.
>
ST. LOUIS. June 28. â Some time
during the night the bag of Santos
Dumont's airship at the World's Fair
grounds was cut and slashed in such
a manner as to preclude all possibility
of its being repaired in time to allow
an ascension on July 4. There are at
Ic.tst twenty long rips in the bag and
Professor Carl Meyers, who has
charge of the aeronautic contests, to
day said that it will take at least two
weeks to repair the damage.
The big gas bag had not yet been
taken from the crate In which it came
from Paris. The cover had been re
moved by a customs inspector and
the crate was rolled into the center
of the big shed prepared for the air
ship. Being of an adhesive material,
the bag was hung in folds from slats
nailed near the top of the crate, and
in this way was prevented from be
coming a solid mass because of its
own weight. There were several fold.-?
of the-bag over each slat and the van
dal drew* his knife across these, cut
ting through from two to four thick
nesses of the material with each
slash. The work evidently was done
in haste. There were about a dozen
slats covered with folds of the bag
and only four or five of them were
cut.
LINCOLN, Neb., June 23.â Governor
Mickey has received several requests
from officers and Sheriffs in Custer.
County, Nebraska, for military to help
j keep order at Broken Bow and in the
surrounding country, where thousands
I of persons have, gathered for the open
j ing of homesteads under the new Kln
kaid land law. The Governor has or
'dered' Company >I of Broken Bow to
be held In readiness. The trouble arises
from the fact that the cattle barons
have sent their cowboys to file on Gov- ;
ernment land that is now fenced and j
to interfere with homesteaders who are i
seeking claims under the provisions of j
the new law. The disputed lands, j
which were thrown open to settlement j
to-day, have been used by the ranch- j
men for grazing purposes. The land !
has been fenced by them and their
fences the Government ordered taken
down in a bill passed by the last ses
sion of Congress'. Many of the home
steaders at Br.oken Bow are armed and
bloodshed is expected.
OMAHA, Neb.. June 28.â Nine mil
lions of acres of Government land in
Nebraska were opened for homestead
entry to-d^y under the provisions of i
the Kinkald law, which permits home
steaders to file on 640 acres of land.
The land opened by the KInkaid law
is known as semi-arid and is mostly j
adapted to grazing. It is the last!
great opening of Government land of |
this nature that will ever be made and j
was the occasion of a rush for choice i
sections by those desiring to establish j
ranches. j
The six land offices In Nebraska were j
the scenes of great excitement. At
O'Neill nearly 1000 persons, a great
percentage of whom were women, were
in line at sunrise.
The greatest excitement was at Brok
en Bow, where more than 2,000,000 acres
of the best land included in the pro
visions of the law was thrown open.
At sunrise more than 2000 persons were ,
in line and Sheriff Richardson, who ;
had already taken extraordinary pre- j
ciutions to forestall trouble, to-day en- j
listed an extra force of deputies to keep j
order. Later he requested Governor i
Mickey to 'order the militia out to j
assist in keeping order. |
Ccr.sul General Gowdy's orders, were
turned over to-day to the consulate. All
were locked and there were no keys. A
ciuloua fact is that the trunks bear as
an identification mark the letter *F"
instead of "L." The tags show that
the first name had been erased.
"I further state that I am positive I
saw Kent J. Loomis and a gentleman
and lady between 1 and 2 o'clock fn the
morning of June 20. walking on deck.
(This was the morning on which the
steamship reached Plymouth.) Loomis
was assisted os sustained in his walk
by the gentleman and lady. I further
elate that the gentleman and lady wed*
the. same who occupied the table with
him and were !ti company with him a
great deal during the trip."
The statement adds certain details
of a rather personal nature which it is
df?s:rab!c- to withhold for the present.

steamship company held subject to
"1 saw on the gangplank going from
the Kaiser Wilhelm II to the tugboat
Plymouth a. man whose name, after
comparing uith his description, I am
positive was Kent J. Loomis." says
Fiamm's statement. ""I was standing
at the railing looking at the tug. prob
ably rive feet away from Locmis. He
wore a light overcoat, eyeglasses and
traveling cap. He had a seat at the
table next to mine. I also saw him
much on deck Â«\r.d around the ship and
knew him sufficiently to identify him
positively. Loomis being a small man
in a light overcoat, his figure became
more conspicuous and. therefore, I am
perfectly satisfied this was Kent J.
Ix>cmis.
PARIS June 2S.â Gustav Flamm of
San Francisco, the passenger on the
Kaiser Wilhelra II. who particularly no
ucecl Kent J. Lcomis, to-day gave the
.American officials a formal written
statement, which will be forwarded to
the State Department In Washington,
giving precise details regarding Loomis
up to the moment Flamm went ashore.
His written statement follows substan
tially the verbal statement which he
made at the American embassy on June
21, but it is more explicit, being in
tended for the official record cf the pas
eer.gcr who last saw Loomis before his
disappearance.

There wi!l be a glut of work for the
Iccal shipyards when the vessels of
the salmon fleet return from the north.
All strors-hulled and well found as
they are. none cf these canvas winged
carriers are built for bucking ice. This
year, owing. to the tardy departure of
Jack Frost from Alaskan waters, near
ly every vessel of the fleet has had
more or less c-f a squet-ze in the frozen
brine of Bristol Bay.
Word from Bristol Bay comes sel
dom and takes a varying lensth of
time to reach the outside world. A
dispatch, dated June 10. was received
here the other day and yesterday came
one of June 9.
According to- this last message many
Of the vessels on June 9 were still tight
in the grip of the ice, although safely
at their anchorage in Bristol Bay.
Judging from dispatches of later date,
but earlier arrival here, they have
since be^n freed and are now loading
salmon for this port and Puget Sound.
Those vessels reported in the ice June
9 were: Alex. fJibsc-n, Oriental. Luclle.

He is no imitator. His work is upon original
lines: Pure thought, clear vision. He tells
you what you desire to know and works in the
open light.
He is as conspicuous for his wonderful occult
analysis as he is for his original expression
and vivid truthfulness. Â¦
,A test reading is not a life reading; when
you call on Prof. Livingstone- he will give you
a full life reading for $1; a test is of little
value; when the mind is troubled ' you need
more substantial aid and advice; this Is Just
what Prof.. Livingstone gives you when you call
en him for- a first-class clairvoyant reading.
He asks you no questions, but tells you what
you wish to know.
Would it not be a relief to know how you
will succeed, to be relieved of the matters
that are troubling you, and of the echemes of
your enemies, that you may meet with txHter
success?
He does not mention all the Ills and misfor-
tunes you are heir to; you are acquainted with
the facts in your case; let Prof. Livingstone
analyze the matters that are troubling you,
find the cause of the trouble and -suggest the
remedy.
His only reason for giving your name In full
or any important information -you may desire
is that he does this incidentally as a chain to

sessment on Stock in Reserve.
GALVESTON, Tex.. June 23.â In it3
efforts to throttle competition, espe-.
dally of the smaller companies, tha
Standard Oil Company has in every*
County of the State in whlca it owr.s)
reserves or has oil stored rendered th*
same for assessment at J3 per barrel.
Two years ago the assessment was 2Q
cents per barrel. As the amount of oil
stored in Texas runs up into the mil
lions of barrels, the revenue in taxa
tion is something enormous.
It Is feared that the ultimate result
of this move on the pan of tha Stand
ard Oil Company will be to force thtf
smaller companies into bankruptcy or
to sell out to the octopus, in which
event the Standard Oil will absolutely
dominate the Texas fields.

KILLING OF CHINESE
3IAY CLEAR MYSTERY
Authorities Declare That Ttiey Have
Evidence to Show That Miss Cul- '
len Was Murdered.
OL.TMPIA, Wash., June 28.â The
mystery surrounding the death of JI1S3
Effle Cullen, a young woman printer,
about five years ago, may be cleared
up through the Indictment filed to-day
against Lum Jo, a Chinese doctor, for
the murder of Don Tin, a vegetable
vendor, who was shot in the back on
his way home at a late hour last Sat
urday night. Miss Cullen disappeared
one evening during the fall of 1S98; the
next day her body was found on the
tide flats in front of. the city. There
were no marks of violence on her body,
but It is known that Miss Cullen was In
ill health and that Lum Jo had been
treating her. The authorities claim
they will be able to show that Don Yin
"knew too much" concerning the death
of Miss Cullen and was put out of the
way for that reason.

NEW YORK. June 2S. â The current dearth
of orders for execution in the stock market
prompted the Stock Exchange authorities to
order the exchange closed for the short Satur
day session preceding Monday, July 4. Pro
fessional operators are habitually disinclined
to enter upon speculative commitments on
the eve of a holiday on account of their feel
ing that any sudden occurrence calculated to
affect the market violently would leave them
at a disadvantage in the prolonged Interval.
with no market available in which to take
measures for their protection or for their ad
vantage.
Many stocks usually prominent were not
dealt In at all and those which were dealt In
drifted Idly % up or % down. Very few
stocks developed sufficiently in headway to
clAr the c?st of a broker's commission on a
rum. Talk of retrenchment on railroad lines,
notably the Baltimore and Ohio, and the re*
ported reduction In working force by a large
locomotive company, were regarded as In
dicative of business contraction. Con
ciusions to be drawn from the weekly crop
bulletin proved rather baffling, but the fall In
wheat left no room for much disturbance over
the crops. London reported prospects for a
revived market with the passing of the stock
market settlement and of the half yearly set
tlements. $4 V4 H
The dwindling of the bond market Is a dis
appointment to those hoping for Improvement
etarting from that department. Movements
*Â¦â¢' many dormant Issues suggest an Investment
search, but the usually active list of bonds
shows some declines in prices and a number of
gaps where no transaction at all is recorded.

CHICAGO. June 2S. â Bearish sentiment pre
vailed In .the wheat pit throughout the day.
At the start the market was affected 1 by the
easier tone of cables and by Improved weather
corUttions. The openinr -on September was
lower at SO%@S0*ic. A fair demand
for September caused the price of that option
to rally to 80^@.?lc. The weakness of July
soon caused a reaction in September. Foreign
advices were rather bearish. A feature of
latÂ»; trading was selling by Southwestern
houses. Reports that the severe drought In
Argentina had been relieved by the heavy rains
were effective tn keeping the bears in final
control, the market closing at about S0%c.
almost the lowest point reached. After selling j
dewn to SO'/ic September finished at 80%Â©
80 %C.
A comparatively firm tone was manifested
in the corn market, although prices made lit
tle change. September ripened a shade lower
Id a shade higher at 48US4S : Â« 8 c and closed at
4SVi@4S%c.
The feature of trading In oats was a little
liquidation of July by local holders. Septem
ber opened unchanged to a shade lower at
31%@31%c, sold to 32c and closed at 31%c.
Provisions were fairly active, the bulk of
trading being done In the way of changing
holdings of July to September. At the close

Wheat and Other Grains.
WHEAT FREIGHTSâ There is no spot bus
iness to report, and In fact, the whole grain
carrying trade Is In a waiting condition. The
rate of 22s 6d for Europe fixed by the ship
owners' combine hangs over the market/ and
nobody wants to do anything until It is seen
whether this rate can be maintained or not.
Brokers say that to obtain a charter now a
ship would have to take 5s less than the com

district, the packers in which appear to have i
forced the market up themselves in their eager
ness to Â«*cure supplies frcm the growers.
Doubts are expressed by conservative people
en the coast that prices can be maintained at
tbeir pr-sÂ«>nt level mhen the competition of dis
tricts Â¦who** crops mature later begins to be
felt, and this view neems to be pretty gener
ally shared by buyers here. Apricots also are
reported to be tending upward, with iwme sell
ers asking 8c the conditions on the coast being
â¢omewhat similar to those in the peach market,
competition among parkers to secure early ma
turing eroxm being held to be the main cause
of the high prices. As in tbÂ« caÂ»e of peaches
buyers are inclined to withhold orders pending

Poultry and Game.
The Poultry market reflected the conditions j
which prevailed last week and was very weak
for ordinary stock, which was In free supply, i
Young Roosters and Fryers, which formed j
but a very small percentage of the receipts,
were firm at previous price*, while everything
else was dull and dealers were offering liberal
concessions In order to effect sales. ThÂ« car
of Western Hens that ceme In late on Mon- i
day was marketed, making the fourth for the
week, and moved off slowly at $5 5OQ6 per
dozen, a decline.

Butter. Cheese and Eggs.
The situation showed no material change j
yesterday. Receipts of Butter were very large,
as will be seen, but the market showed no
weakness. Storing is about over, except as an
outlet to relieve an occasional oversupply in
some house. The demand is very fair for mid
summer and Is generally taken by the trade as
indicating a marked Increase in the population
of San Francisco, for never before has the local
trade taken so much Butter as this year. 1
Cheese shows little change, strictly choice
mild new being In light supply and .firm and
the cheaper grades plentiful and dull.
Quotations for Eggs remain unchanged. The
market Is liberally nupplied and not oversteady.
Receipts were 113,700 Sbs ButtÂ«r. 1353 cases
Eggs and 11,300 lbs Cheese.

Deciduous and Citrus Fruits.
The market for deciduous fruits had a better '
tone, as fresh receipts were light and overripe
and small green stock, which had previously
been in free supply, had disappeared, having 1
been cleaned up to peddlers and others on the
preceding day. Receipts of Apricots and
Peaches were unusually light and cleaned up
pretty well at firmer prices, with occasional
lots of fancy, suitably packed for shipping,
selling at a premium. The canners were of
fering $20@25 per ton for white and as high
as $30 for yellow Apricots, but were unable to
secure many, as better prices could be ob
talned from the regular trade. Figs were still
In free supply and weak, while Plums. Pears
and choice Apples were In good request and
steady. Trade In Melons was fair at steady
rates, while the market for Berries was weak,
with supplies liberal and trade quiet. The
canners were paying $2 for large Strawberries
and $3 50 for Raspberries. Cherries were well
cared for at steady rates and Currants did
better under greatly decreased receipts.
Citrus and Tropical fruits attracted but little ;
attention and all descriptions stood as pre- Â¦

Superior Judge Trputt ""- yesterday
placed the stamp of the cburt^pn" the
Must Pay Wife $19,800â Custody of
, . Child Reserved by . Court.
interlocutory decree of divorce prayed
for .-byvJI. A. C Christesen from Â¦ his
tvife. s Annie E.' Christesen. on the
ground of cruelty. â¢ .Christesen is the
proprietor of, the "Branch. Coffee
House." which his wife says 'is a
money-making institution, and he
also owns property on Miiision street,
near Fifth. His complaint for di
vorce alleges that his wife had hu
miliated him -by calljng him a slob,
hobo and ; worse names, and that on
.a trip to Honolulu she would have
nothing to do with him. Finally she
packed the, household; furniture . and
went 1 to_ Berkeley. 'She filed an answer
to'his. suit, ; denying all of ; his allega
tions and asking for a divorce herself.
-Under the decree granted yesterday
it | is stipulated . that Christesen \ shall
pay," her $10,500 and-" $500 - attorney's
fees, $100 a month for twelve months
and; $8800 in, July- of next year. ' She
is "to give -him 4 a quitclaim for her
share - in * the Mission-street ; property.
Their 14-year-old -."; daughter, Ruth,
has hot made : up her ') mind as to
which j parent she will go ; with, but it
is*- 1 agreed" that whichever one ( she
elects ' shall pay for her support and
of the Lynches, she says, George's
mamma at the table would sit -vith hen
back to the plaintiff and would not
speak to her.
Aside from the loss of the affection
and comfort of George. $20,000 will do 43
a balm for Grace Lynch's wounded
feelings.. â¢*
Many aches and . pains yield promptly to
Parker's Glnser Tonic. Try it,
Parker's Hair BaUam will save your hair. â¢
After reciting the facts of her mar
riage to George A. Lynch and their go
ing to live at the home of his parents,
the disillusioned wife launches into a
novel recitation of her treatment there,
which she characterizes as "wanton
cruelty."
She says that her mamma-in-law and
papa-in-law had conspired to destroj
her peace of mind and happi
ness. In pursuit " of that con
spiracy they resorted to hypno
tism, suggestion, insult, ridicule and
other agencies of spite to make her un
comfortable and to entice her husband
from his post of duty and fidelity. She
alleges that they "resorted to a cam
paign of tyranny, trickery and perse
cution"; that they exercised hypnotic
control over his mind and inculcated
feelings of prejudice and illwill against
her. They declared that she brought
moths and other Insects into the house
in her trousseau, she says. They ridi
culed America, knowing that she was
an American. They called her a
"fisherwoman" and an "ugly thing."
They made her husband compel her to
wear hats and clothes distasteful to
her and 'forced her to receive their
friends from whom she' had been
estranged. .r.-V,v
They continued, she charges, to Insult
her In the presence of her husband, and
by their strong , power of hypnotism
kept him away from her for three
weeks. Falling to keep him away al
together they induced him to take a
trip to England. Then, she says, they
would talk to a pet parrot and ex
press, in her hearing, the hope that
"George" would fall in love with a'
nice girl in England and they could
join him there. This same green bird,
she says, was taught to speak the
names of each member of the family
in terms of endearment, but was never
taught, to speak her name.
After her husband went abroad, says
the wife, she was subjected to a new
series of indignities and was finally
starved out of the house. The servants
had been taught to treat her with con
tumely, and when she was sick she was
fed upon cold meats .and sausages,
which food was against the advice of
her physician. Before she left the home
Mrs. Grace Lvnch, a bride of a year
and a half, has had such a weird ex
perience with her parents-in-law that
she seeks compensation in the sum of
$20,000 damages from the father and
mother of her husband, George A.
Lynch. The complaint of Mrs. Grace
Lynch against Mrs. E. Lynch and Alex
ander L. Lynch was filed yesterday in
the Superior Court. The defendants are
English people of some means^who live
at 759 Golden Gate avenue. To their
home her husband brought the young
Mrs. Lynch after they were married on
New Year's day, 1903. George Lynch
has left his wife and is now in Eng
land.
Â¦ Mrs. Hislop -declared that her hus
band sent a friend named Lang to
her, with .apropositionr for^ reconcilia
tion and she hud told him ; that'll' was
uselessâ that her husband had been
untrue too often. 'When she cited
circumstances \to.' Lang the latter is
alleged to have said that he would
never ask her. to jro | back, to . Hislop
and. that no decent man on- the road
had any respect â for, him. She /said
that Hislop admitted having;; ; given
Violette $50 and she reproached .\hlm
for it, saying it was, needed at home.
When Mrs. Hislop was called In re
buttal she denied â¢ that her husband
had ever spoken \ to her about being
careful of her reputation with Brown
or had mentioned- the startling inci
dent referred to. . On the contrary,
she said that Hislop invited Brown to
the house when she had expressed a
preference to be alone with her hus
band. , . ,
Questioned further on this -point
Hislop said that he had spoken to his
wife about belnsr careful of her repu
tation with Brown, and had told her
that the banker was notorious for his
pursuit of tho fair sex and' had re
ceived a charger of buckshot-from an
rate husband In Napaz-
He was ' questioned upon various
points of the letter he had written
his wife regarding the Griswold
woman and said that he had written
as he did to arouse his wife's jeal
ousy in order to make .her "set rid
of Brown." This reference was to
Henry A. Brown, paying teller of
Wells-Fargo ; Bank, '.whom Hislop is
suing for' $50,000 : damages for alien
ating Mrs. Hislop's i affections.
Wire Denies Husband's Testimony in
Reference to Paying Teller Brown.
George W. Hislop and his wife
Louisa disagreed yesterday upon some
very material points in the trial of
her suit for divorce before Judge
Sloss. The taking of evidence was
finished, and it only remains for the
arguments to be he*ard.
Hislop was on the stand in the
morning and during part of thV af
ternoon. He denied all of her charges
of infidelity and claimed that his wife
had deserted him. He admitted that
hg'had met ViolettejGriswold in the
north and. had met "her mother, but
declared that nothing improper had
occurred. Explaining the incident
of taking her to the Raleigh Hotel,
he said that he had been asked to
recommend a place by Griswold and
had gone there with Mrs. Griswold
and engaged rooms, while. Griswold
looked after the baggage. Griswold
came a few minutes later an"d Hislop
left. Â¦ , . ..
I1ISLOP EVIDENCE IS IN.
His appearance in Judge Graham's
court in a rough and ready shirt and
working clothes, and his plea of earn
ing only $50 a month did not serve Wil
liam H. Schmidt his purpose of fooling
the court into denying the claim of his
wife, Carrie, for maintenance. The
Judge, who had seen the man sporting
diamonds, ordered him to pay her $40 a
month and $75 attorney's fees. The
wife testified that she had never seen
William in such clothes and she be
lieved he owned a half interest in the
saloon business of Holtum & Schmidt.
Schmidt said he only owned one $50
share In the house and held that in or
der to keep his job.
On the grounds of insufficient evi
dence Judge Sea well yesterday denied
the application of Roger Walton for
divorce from his wife, Phoebe, for de
sertion.
Pending the hearing of her suit for
divorce it was ordered yesterday that
Anthony S. Pedro pay his wife,. Freder
ika, $40 a month and ?50 attorney's
fees. . .

FAMOUS AUTHOR WHO HAS
BEEN SUED KOR DIVORCE Bi'
HIS WIFE, i
London came into prominence in the
literary world after his return from
the Klondike, where he wrote "The Son
of the Wolf." Following that excursion
Into a new field came "Children of the
Frost," "Daughter of the Snows,"
"The Kempton-Wace Letters," "The
Call of the Wild" and "Children of the
Abyss," besides many short stories: In
his turbulent 'career London has been
newsboy; sailor, longshoreman, fisher
man, seal hunter, novelist and war
correspondent.
The Londons married on April 7.
15*00. Mrs. London was Elizabeth Mad
dern. the daughter of Mrs. Melissa
Maddern of this city, and a cousin of
Minnie Maddern Fiske, the. actress.
Mrs. London has a reputation as a
teacher in English. It was a mutual
Interest in literature that originally
brought her and London together. *
of Sacramento, who has charge of the
case, said his client was under a phy
sician's care. It is said, indeed, that
Mrs. London has for many -months
been in delicate health as a result of
her husband's neglect. Whether there
shall be a bitter contest cannot be de
termined until some word shall have
been received from London, who is in
Manchuria.
Mrs. Hanford says she a-sked. her
husband what he had talked about to
the woman and he replied,. "what peo
ple talk about who love each other."
Then it is alleged that Hanford told
the plaintiff that "the grand passion
only comes to a man once and that It
had come to him, mailing it necessary
he should stay with Mrs. Cavalsky."
He asked his wife, she says, to get a
divorce so that he could marry â¢ the
woman. This she refused to do. Then
he said : he would go down town and
live. alone and send Mrs. Cavalsky away
for four months and pey her expenses.
If at the end of. that time he thought
as-much ofiher as she did of him he
would gret a divorce and marry her.
On June 14 he announced that his af
fections were unchanged. . And now the
wife sues for the divorce. .
She came at >> o'clock and Mrs. Han
ford Immediately told her that her hus
band had confessed "all of the horrible
affair." * Then- Mrs. ' Hanford left] the
room. She returned: to her bedroom an
hour later and fn going to her dresser
passed the open door of her husband's
room. Looking in she saw Mrs. Caval
sky leaning over him, with her arms
around his neck and her face against
his. Emphasizing the agony of this
sight, Mrs. Hanford says that she im
mediately left the house' and did not
return until 10:30, after she had learned
by. telephone that Mrs. Cavalsky had
left.
THE RIVALS MEET AGAIN.
That was the beginning. On May
15, she says, they were upstairs In their
home at 2207 Clay street, when the hus
band became '"greatly agitated and
wept." He. said that he had lost his
nerve. His wife's frequent persuasion
failed to win a confession as to what
his trouble was. His distress continued
for two days. He said it was not money
trouble, as he "had more money than
he kne'w what to do with." On the 17th
he admitted that it was a woman and
that she was Gabriel Cavalsky, Whom
he had met at Del Monte and who was
married and was then living with her
husband.
The wife then reminded the husband
that ho was suffering from an Incurable
disease from which he might be para
lyzed and asked if Mrs! Cavalsky knew
of it. He said no and asked If Mrs.
Cavalsky might not visit him at the
home in order that she might be told.
Thinking that this information might
serve to separate them the wife con
sented, and according to the complaint,
herself called Mrs. Cavalsky up by
phone at her home, the Hart House, on
Ellis street. At that time Mr. Han
ford. was ill in bed. After Mrs. Han
ford got her rival oi| the wire Hanford
got up and talked to her and asked her
to come to his house.
The complaint avers that the Han
fords were married here on May 19, 1896,
and that there are no children. The hus
band's cruelty is alleged to have begun
on May 4 last. On that day they were
visiting the Hotel Del Monte and Han
ford introduced his wife to Gabriel Ca
valsky as "a girl she could play golf
with."
Mrn. Hanford's complaint is novel
in the manner in which It gives a se
quence of dates and events, and hints
delicately at matters which are ordi
narily, told in bolder language. The
woman named in the case ia Mrs. Ga
briel Cavalsky, who, it is. said, has left
her husband and gone to live with her
mother,
Tho agony of seeing her husband 111
in his own home, with the arms of an
other woman around his neck and her
face, pressed close to his, is the climax
of the story told by Marguerite Han
ford yesterday in a complaint filed for
divorce, against her husband, Robert
Gilmer Hanford. Her attorneys are
Garbeiy Creswell & Garber. In addi
tion . to the divorce the plaintiff de
mands an injunction against the hus
band ar.d his brother, Albert Hanford,
to prevent them from disposing of large
propel ty Interests. She alleges that
much of her husband's property was
transferred to Albert without consider
ation and asks the court to invalidate
this reputed sale until the division of
community property is settled. She be
lieves that $400 a month will do for
alimony pending the litigation.
Hanford is a mining man of wealth
and position. He owns shares in the
United Railroads, the Folsom Devel
opment Company, the Syndicate Dredg
ing Company, the Ashburton Dredging
Company, and the P'olsom Machinery
Company, besides other securities un
known.
WOMAN IX THE CASE.
Miss Strunsky's name was first pub
licly associated with that of London a
year ago when the^Kempton Wace Let
ters" were given from the press as the
joint wcrk of the pair. This collabora
tion was a discussion of love in a phil
osophical sense and essayed to Indi
cate the passion and sentiments of a
pair of friends in a series of epistles.
The work "attracted some attention.
More it gained when the announcement
was made that London and his wife
had parted.
SEPARATION OF -THE LONDON'S.'
That separation occurred after the
London? returned last summer from a
camping trip to Glen Ellen. While there
it is said Mrg. London gained the be
lief that her husband no longer loved
her and that Miss Strunsky was the
new idol of his heart. So thoroughly
satisfied of this was the wife that she
simply took her children and departed.
And nothing that any of their common
friends could do to reconcile them was
of avail. London took up his residence
in this city and remained here until
he went to the Orient as a war corre
spondent. Mrs. London went to South
ern California for a while, but return
fd recently and has been living for a
f me with her brother. Henry T. Mad
Â«lern, 8<>5 Twenty-first street.
There the relatives to-day said that
Mrs. London was prostrated and could
not be seen. Attorney R. T. McKisick
Specifically Mrs. London is not yet
prepared to make more serious accu
sations than that in general her hus
band's love for the 'woman whom he
made hi5 wife four years ago has been
alienated by Miss Strunsky. For ac
tual ground of divorce Mrs. London has
been content to allege a statutory of
ftns*?, j? uch as she would be entitled
to set forth after a separation of one
year.
Not that aught of wrongdoing is
charged against Anna Strunsky In her
acquaintance with London; but Mrs.
London believes she has ample reason
to condemn her husband. She declares
ehe has heard him protest his love for
Miss Strunskv on more than one oc
casion. It is asserted, indeed, that
Mrs. London- has found epistolary evi
dence that London's affection is re
ciprocated by the bright young woman
author. y
OAKLAND. June 28.â Jack London,
author and newepaper correspondent,
has been sued for divorce by Eliza
beth London, his accomplished wife
and the mother of .their two pretty
children, Joan and Bess.
The complaint filed here to-day is
under seal, but" It is understood that
the cause alleged is desertion. Just
a year, the statutory time, has elapsed
eince the couple separated.
With the complaint was filed an or
der obtained from Superior Judge W.
E. Greene restraining London from
drawing any funds, either for news
paper cervices, from bis deposit in
bank or from his account with
Houghton, Mifflin & Co., his Boston
publishers, pending the settlement of
the divorce proceedings.
It is not the story of an ordinary do
mestic upheaval that has led the
yotfng wife to the divorce court with
her plaints. Behind it all is the shadow
of . another woman, ; a gifted writer,
vho has won the place in London's
heart that the unhappv wife tried so
vainly to hold. Anna Strunsky. stu
dent, author and follower of the so
cialistic cult, Is the woman. Her name
has been so closely linked with that
of Jack London that the wife has
taken cognizance of the friendship and
has made her story of unhappiness re
plete with incidents in which the other
Woman's name is all too prominent.
AFFINITY FOR MISS STRUXSKY.
Carleton was a great favorite with
impressionable and unsophisticated
young women wherever he went. At
Mont Rio, It is said, he mowed down
the girls by the Cozen. The prisoner
declined to speak of the charges
against him and threatened to fight
the removal proceedings, which will be
begun in the Federal courts within a
few days. . His ball was fixed by
United States Commissioner Manley
at f2000, In default of which Carleton
was lodged in the City Prison. He said
he had $1500 with him. but that $2000
was beyong his reach.
The name under which the prisoner
and his confederates operated was
"C. C. Lawrence & Co.. bankers and
brokers, Schofied building, Cleveland,
Ohio." Connected with him were
Charles Carrao, alias C. A. Flanders,
and George Harris, alias G. G. Ed
wards. These two fled, but were ar
rested by postoffice inspectors in Balti
more, Md., and placed In jail at Cleve
land, Ohio. . The complaint charges the
prisoners with having secured from five
or six victims $7500 through false and
fraudulent representations made
through the mails.
Two weeks ago Inspector O'Connell
trailed Carleton from Kansas City to
Los Angeles. Before O'Connell reached
that city Carleton had come to San
Francisco and roomed on Post. street.
Then he. went to Duncan Mills and
later to Mont Rio, where there are
hearts that bleed with chagrin and dis
appointment.
Fashionable people at Mont Rio
camping: grounds on the Sonoma coast
were shocked and grieved when Post
office Inspector James O'Connell I and
Deputy United States Marshal R. de a
Lancie arrived last Monday night and
took Into their rude hands the Idol of
the camp, handsome C. H. Carleton,
alias C. C.' Lawrence, alias Elmer R.
Chase, alias Joseph B. Kaufman. The |
glided" youth with- many aliases Is
wanted by the Federal . authorities in
Cleveland, Ohio,, for using the malls
for the purpose of defrauding the
gullible portion of the public with a
fradulent banking and brokerage
scheme.
