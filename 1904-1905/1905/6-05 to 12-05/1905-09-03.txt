*\ *yr BOUT this business of the
â¢â¢ f \ new road.~ said he. "If I
I 1 â¢' were the only party at Inter-
V* I est. I'd let Dunkirk go ahead,
. â¢: for It's undoubtedly a good
thins from the public standpoint. But
Ire g-ot to consider the Interests of all
tliose Tm trustee forâ the other share
holders In the Ramsay Company and In
cur" other concerns here." i\ '
' â¢"Yes," replied X, "but why da you-
Bay Dunkirk intends'to build -the road?
Why do iou take that for granted?"
"He's all ready to do It,. and If d be a
money-maker from the start." '
"But," I went on, ."you must assume
that he has no Intention Jof building, ,
' that he is only making an elaborate
bluff. How do you know but that he
wants to get this right of way and
charter co that he can blackmail you
and your concerns, not merely once, but
year after year? You'd gladly pay him
several hundred thousand dollars a year
not to use his charter and right of way,
wouldn't you?" ' . '
"I never thought of that!" exclaimed
Ed. "1 believe you're right, Harry, and
you've taken a weight off my \u25a0 con
science. There's * nothing like a good
lawyer to make a man see straight.
What an Infernal hound old Dunkirk
is!"
"And," I went on, "If he should build
tlie road, what would he do with It?
'Why, the easiest and biggest source- of
profit would be to run big excursions
every .Saturday and Sunday, especially
Sunday, Into Fredonia. He'd 111 l the
. place every Sunday, from May till No
vember, with roistering' roughs, from
the slums of Chicago. How'd the peo
ple li&e that?"
v He wouldn't dare," objected Ram
say, stupidly insisting on leaning back
ward In his determination to stand
straight. "He's a religious hypocrite.
He'd be afraid." ; ;
"As Deacon Dunkirk he j wouldn't
dare." I replied. "But as th% Chicago
and Fredonla Short Line he'd dare any
thing, and nobody would blame him
personally. You know how that is."
Kd was looking'at roe in dazed admi
ration. "Then," I went on, "there are
the retail merchants of Fredonla. Has
It; ever -occurred to them, 'in their ex
citement In favor of this new road, that
it'll ruin them? Where will the shopping
\u0084be done If the women can get to Chl
1 cago In two hours and a half ?"
"i'ou're right, you're right!" exclaim
ed lid, rising to pace the -floor In his
' agitdtion. ' "Bully for. you,; Harvey!
WeUl show the people that the road'll
ruin the town morally and financially."
. i'But you must come out In ' favor
of. It." said L "We mustn't give
Dunkirk the argument that you're
lighting It because you'd be injured
by it. No, you must be hot for the
roadr. Perhaps you might give out
that , yo^ were considering selling
your property on the lake' front to a
company that was going to change It Into
a brewery and huge pleasure park. As
Che lake's only a few hundred yards
wide, with the town along one bank and
( your place along the other, why, I think
* tftajt'd* rouse the people to their peril."
"That's the kind of fire to fight the
devil "with," said he, laughing. "I don't
think" Mister Senator Dunkirk, will get
the consent of Fredonia."
"But there's the Legislature," eaid I.
His face fell. "I'm afraid he'll do us In
the end, old man."
I thought not, but I \u25a0 only said, "Well,
" -weive. got until next winterâ if we can
"beat him* here."
Ed insisted that I must stay on and help
\u25a0 him at the delicate task of reversing the
'. current of Fredonia . ~ sentiment. My
there of the work was Important enough,
â¢butj as It was confined entirely to mak
;lng suggestions. It took little of my. time,
trhad no leisure, however, for there was
â¢Carlotta to look after.
â¢ When it, was all over and ehe had tojd
. Ed and he had shaken hands with her
and had kissed me and- had otherwise
\u0084Â«bown the chaotic condition of his mind,
"and she and I were alone again, she said,
t."How aid , It happen? . I don't remember
â¢that you really proposed to me. Yet we
certainly are engaged." \
â¢ "We certainly are." said I, ; "and that* s
the essential point. Isn't it?"
"Yes." she admitted, "butâ" and ehe
look mvstlfled.
â¢Aye drifted." I suggested.
- She glanced at me. with , a .smile that
' was ah enigma.' "Yesâ we Just drifted.
Why do you look at me bo queerly?"
"I was just going to ask you that came
question," said I by way of evasion.
Then we both fell to thlnKlng, and after
a long time she roused herself â¢to Bay,
"But we shall be very nappy. 1^ am so
fond of you.v And you are going to be a
great man and you do so look it, even if -
you sren't tall and fair, as I always
thought the man- I married would 'be..
Don't look at me like that. ; Your . eyes
are strange enough. when you are" smiling; :
but when youâ l often 'wonder what
you're so sad about." _ â¢-. - Â» .\u25a0
"Have you ever seen a grown per
son's face that wasn't sad in repose?!*
I asked, eager to shift from the par
ticular to the general. \u25a0 <
"A few Idiots or near.' idiots,", she
replied with a laugh. Thereafter we.
talked of the future and let the past
sleep in Its uncovered" coffin.
CHAPTER V. ;>
A Good Man and HU Woes.
After Ed and I, had carried the Fre
donia election against Dunkirk's road
we went fishing with Roebuck "in the
Northern Wisconsin woods. , I had-two
weeks In which to impress myself upon
him; besides, there was Ed; 'â¢ who .ref
lated in tedious but effective detail, on
the slightest provocation, the achieve
ments that had made him my devoted
admirer. So when I went to visit ' Ro
e' buck in June at his house * near -Chi
cago he was. ready to listen to me in
the proper spirit.- . : \u25a0
I soon drew him on to tell of his
troubles "with"- Dilnkirk-^-how j the Sen--'
etor . was gouging him and., every - ; big
corporation doing business In the.
State. "I've been loyal to ; the party
for forty years," said he bitterly, "yet
If I had been on the other side it
couldn't cost me more to do busi
ness. I have to pay enough here,
heaven knows. But it costs \me
more in your State â with your man
Dunkirk." His \ white . face grew pink j
with anger. "It's monstrous! Yet you
should have heard him address my Bun
day school scholars at the last annual
outing I gave them. What an evidence
of the power of religion it is that Buch
wretches as he pay the tribute of hypo
crisy to lt!'V
His business and his religion were Roe
buck's two absorbing passions â religion
rapidly predominating as he drew further
away from sixty. /
"Why do you endure this blackmailing,
Mr. Roebuck?" I asked. '"He Is growing
steadily worse."
"He is certainly more rapacious than hÂ«
was ten years ago," Roebuck admitted.
"Our virtues or our vices, whichever. we
give the stronger hold on . us, i become
more marked as we approach Judgment.
When we finally go, we Are prepared for
the place that has been prepared for us.".
"But why do you put up with bis im
pudence?" . â¢
"What can we do? He has political
power, and is our only protection against \u25a0
the people. They have been inflamed with
absurd notions about their rights. They
are filled with envy and suspicion of the
rich. They have passed laws, to 'hamper
us In developing the country,, and want
to* pass more and worse laws. So we
must either go | out , of business and let
the talents God has given us lie idle in
a napkin, or pay the Dunkirks ', to pre
vent the people from having their ignor
ant wicked way, and destroying us : and
themselves. For how . would they , get
work if we didn't provide it for them?"
"A miserable makeshift system," said I,;
harking back to Dunkirk and his black
mailing, for I was not Just then In the
mood to amuse myself with the contor
tions of Roebuck's flexible and: fantastic
"moral sense." , _ .. \ â¢
"I've been troubled in conscience a great
deal, Harvey, a great deal, about the ,
morality of - what . we business men 'â¢ are \u25a0
forced to do. I hopeâ indeed I feelâ that,
we are Justfled in protecting our property
in the only ' way open to us. The devil
must be fought with fire, you know."
"How much did I Dunkirk . rob j you of j
last year V I asked. â¢ ,
"Nearly three hundred thousand dol
lars," he said, and his expression sug
gested that each ' dollar had '\u25a0 been'
separated from him . with, 'as great!
agony as if if had been so much .flesh
pinched from his body. '.There was
Domlnick, besides, and a \lot, of Infa
mous Btrlke-bllls to be quieted;* It cost'
$500,000 in allâ ln your 'State; alone.;
\u25a0And we didn't ask a single'bit of new
legislation. All the money kwas paid
Just to escape persecution 'under] those
alleged laws! Yet they Yiall this a" free,
country! When I think of the?martyr
dom â yes, the mental - and moral - mar-"
tyrdom. of the men who have made! this
countryâ. What are the few; millions
a man may amass in compensation, for
what he has to endure?*. Why, Sayler,
I've not the slightest doubt you could'
find well-meaning,, yes, â¢â¢ really j honest.
God-fearing people," who jwould', tell < you
lam a scoundrel! . I have read sermons,;
delivered from pulpits against me T Ser
mons from pulpits!" '
"I havo thought out a plan," -said I,
after a moment's silent .and : 2 shocked
contemplation of this deplorable state
of; affairs, \"a plan to^end Dunkirk and
cheapen 'the cost of . political ; business."
' r Ate "cheapen Hhe . cost"-his*r big ,\u25a0", ears

Continued on Pag* T.THE passing of the tights in the cir
cus arena and on the stage has
been one of . the most Interesting
Incidental features inÂ»tbe evolution
of modern amusements.
Long gowns and up-to-date fashions
have invaded the circus as well as the
stage, and , one of the much ,' discussed
characteristics of the current ring show
is the modish style of dress that prevails
In every act where such costuming Is pos
eible. Even the dressing of the hair Is
done in the latest fashion and with great
care. Bows, aigrettes and ornamental
.combs are as much a part of a circus
rider's toilet sis that of a society wo
man. A wealth of hair is now the real
thing in the arena. The short-haired'cir
cus woman and the fluffy haired soubrette
. have disappeared together. Â«
In recent years there has been a most
pronounced change in circus costuming.
Up to a comparatively recent period the
fchor t ballet skirt, buoyed up by yards
j and yards at tarletan. and a little bodice,
were supposed to be the one possible cos
tume lor the circus performer. No at
* tempt was made to keep up with the pre
vailing mudes. To-day the long, trailing
, * eilk and chiffon dress is to be seen as
often as a short-skirted costume. It Is
elaborately correct in every detail. Ex
cept in the aerial acts, where freedom
from skirts is imperative, tights and "il
lusion" have been well-nigh eliminated.
How the artists can perform so cleverly
In these long gowns has not yet ceased to
be a mystery to the public. This change
in circus costuming has been so gradual
that it has scarcely been perceptible to
the average show-goer. That it has
come to stay, however, is generally be
lieved by those most interested in it. In
contrast to much in the modern big cir
cus, it is an American idea. In the Euro
pean circuses the tights and gauze skirts
of the "lady rider" still hold sway. The
American women who performed in long
ekJrts during the European tour of tha
Barnum & Bailey circus created a mild
sensation. Nothing like it had ever been
before seen on the Continent.
It was an American family of acrobats
whose female members first appeared la
s long skirts. Prior to that t\m* guoh a â¢
thing as a woman throwing a somersault
In a gown was considered impossible.
Women had, in fact, just begun to denvj
onstrate that they could rival men as
gymnasts. For years the mere turning
of a handspring by a, woman was con-,
eidered a remarkable feat. When at last
a clever girl from Germany, a dsuightef
of the famous old showman, Rente,
turned a real somersault and actually
did it on the back of a horse, the circus
. world was astonished. When a little later
a troupe of American acrobats, known as
the Eddy family, presented a couple of
young women who executed single som
ersaults on the ground and double ones
from shoulder to shoulder, and performed
their novel act in long skirts. It was
thought the limit of accomplishment had
been overreached. Strange to say, It was
not so much the cleverness of these girls
that excited the circus worldâ it was the
fact that they did their work In skirts,
instead of the conventional tights. These
girls soon had imitators. The following
season there were several troupes of
acrobats whose female members per
formed in long dresses. It was a novelty
that the public took kindly to, and, more
over, it afforded new ideas for the picto
rial â¢â¢billing" of the show.
It is a curious fact that, almost coinci
dent with this change of fashion in the
circus, the astuie theatrical manager be
gan to look with distrust on tights and
scantily draped principals and figurantes,
and to turn his attention to the possibili
ties of up-to-date street and reception
gowns on the stage. There was a time,
and. not so long ago, eittier, when the
s-traitlaceJ part of the amusement
loving public regarded tights with dis
favor, and this style of costuming was
considered bad form outside of the "va
riety" theaters and the circus. In the
circus it was good-naturedly tolerated,
because of the apparent w difficulty of
women presenting the ] strenuous acts, of
the arena in any other attire. The ad
vent of the modern comic opera and mu
sical comedy brought in an era of tights
and shapely choruses. Old-time .preju-:
dices were forgotten in the entertainment
afforded by these frequently clever pro
ductions. To all appearances the erst
while burlesque company had been trans
planted from "varieties" into the "legiti
mate," and the public liked it. With
"Florodora" and several other musical
comedies of the came general character
the pendulum again swung the other
way. Instead of displaying her figure in
tights, the lissome shapeliness of the cho
rus girl was accentuated by close-fitting
gowns of rich and costly material, and
made in the highest style of the tailoring
art: and this elegance of costuming is
still a feature of the so-called "legiti
mate" stage.
The influence of fashion has even per
vaded the vaudevilles to a limited extent.
Ten years ago the serio-comic singer
would have disdained to appear in any
thing less "fetching" than tights or ab
breviated skirts. "To-day the "lady solo
ist" wears long skirts, and the latest
Ideas in up-to-date fashion are lavished
upon her wardrobe. There are tights-
plenty of tnemâ but they are again - the
almost exclusive , trade mark of the
merry, 4 If not always shapely, bur
lesquer!

The .change from tights to gowns has.
however, been a very costly innovation
for the women of the circus. Long dresses
are much more expensive and soil
more readily, than short ones. This means
that Instead of two or three costumes tho â¢
modern circus star must have a half- *
dozen or more, with hat.-*, gloves, lingerie ,
and shoes to match. Salaries have gone
Bp, but so have expenses, and circus wo
aen annually spend hundreds of dollars
in endeavoring to keep up to the standard
of modern circus costuming, lime. Flor
enz has one dress for her acrobatic act
that cost 2700 francs in Paris, and one of
the fluffy white gowns wore by Mils.
Mauricia de Tiers, who loops the gap In
an automobile at the Barnum & Bailey
curcus performances, is the creation of a
Parisian modiste, who received 3000 francs
for the work. And these are only two in
stances in many where . large sums of .
money have been paid for circus cos
tumes. ' . ' - \u25a0' . . :. â¢' .-
Fashion In the circus to-day Is not alto
gether the result of public demand. The
feminine spirit of emulation in dress,
such as appear in the neighborhood of so
cial sets, is a strong motif. toward mak
ing female performers dress in the height
of fashion whenever it Is possible to do
so in the arena. While It is demanded of
them ; by the management , they ' dress to
a certain standard, the number of gowns
a* circus woman wears and the elaboration
of toe -trimming on them depends largely
on the spirit of rivalry. The public, or a
large part of it. welcome the change from
tights to skirts. It remained for the wo
men of the circus to complete the evolu
tion by making their gowns a reflex of
the . latest - things -to twentieth - century ,
fashion. " . ' _* '

G X "TURNEIR
IN th? crater of Ths Holler, crouched
clong the Â»oad, Hes the old mill, a
decrepit old taonfteT of Live and
gi-ayis.li uatlvo rtone.
If you so down Into the black hole
which faces on ths road, in the base
jnont cf the mill, you will reach
first a narrow passageway; then to the
right of this you will come to the Jelnt
boiler and engine room, where you will
discover Pat Foley. He will appear sit
ti;ig crosg-legged on his shoe box by
the engineâ a little, grimy, streaked
man. with a dirty old stub of a clay
pipe fixed, bowl downward, in bis teeth.
Beside him you will find Tom Donelan,
the fiicman.
â¢ If he Is propitious Pat will give you
the greasy armchair intended for hi 3
own consumption, bat never used by
him. You must then ask him for the
6tory of his succession to the throne; It
is worth hearing. He told it to me some,
time last spring. Tom Donelan put me
on the track when Pat had stepped out
cf the room.
"Ask the old man about him and
Koonter." he said.
"Who's Hunter?" I asked.
"Oh, he's the man before Pat/"
Then Pat came back again.
, "Well. Pat." I asked, "how is she to
day?" "She," according to the language
,of her operator. $s the antique engine.
"Just lcok at her now." said Pat, "the
dessleful old crature; calm and awate
and paceful as an unhatched egg.
Whu'd belave what a low. dirty, ram
&hus, contrary old baste she is, and me
after bavin' spint me whole blizsed
â¢inorain' drtvin* her to her duty."
He settled down on his Ghoe box and
shook his dirty fist at her.
"They tell me you've had some lively
times with her." I continued, angling.
\u25a0 "Hew about that?"
"Con act. I have." said Pat. puffin?
away to light his pipe ag^in. "Cursed
be thÂ» moind that consaved her and
the hand that laid her down. She niver
vet was set to rights. 'Twas some little
dry goods clerk that made her, and no
true machinist."
9 "Were you ever afraid of her?** I
"No, I was not," said Pat.
"Thct toime with Hoonter, ye was,"
Interrupted Tom.
"â¢Will, thin, wance I was, and wance
only."
And so v.c had him hooked. . ..-\u25a0
"Ye niver see Jim Hoonter, did ye,
6cr? No? Thin you missed the seem*
of a roost peculiar man. A most un
nsu&l man he was; was he not, Tom?"
" "He wes," i^iid Tom, with great sol
emnity.
"A most unusual man. Big as an
, eliphunt he was. Not soft-loike, but
brisllin' all over his anatoomy with
bones. He had a chist on him loike
thim boilers. Six feet three he stud,
and hi 2 big: tv&ite beard trailin' down
to his ivaistâ a foine old figger of a
mon. for all the world loike the pic

IT was apparent that their visit to
the Art Museum had nothing to!
do with art. It was equally plain!
that their feeling for each other
could ' not f be l ; described as pla
tonlc Betttna, to be sure, affected un
consciousness as she V sauntered
through the lof ty rooms ' where the
marble figures flashed coldly Into' vlew, :
exciting one to a new love of mere
flesh and blood;- but all the time she
knew that to the man at her side she
was queen of the world. Also/ It was
evident enough from the look of.dis-
content on - the man's face that her
loyal subject was not altogether hap
py.
"Your, place is right- here on. a
pedestal along with the other statues,"
was what ' he was ' saying to her. "The
trouble with you Is, Betty, that j you
won't listen to ' your heart. :I \u25a0 might
as well plead with this marble figure!"
The queen, with wellrf elgned re
luctance, brought her glance back
from the headless "Victory" that
, seemed forever on the pomt r of flight,
to the youth at '2 her side, who . was

V^ * Only the other day In a mod-

borhood south of Market, a
grlrl, tweet, young. Innocent and vir
tuous, rushed from her mother's pres
ence, snatched up a bottle of carbollo
add and made a frantically determined
effort to end her life.
Why? : -"'
"I was just tired of the nagging."

It was out of the fullness of under

It was self-pity that sighed: "Poor.,

for himself*' what nagging meansVfand
there are many of usâ lf , only we had
the courage to declare ourselvesâ that
would rather die or go to Jail than be .
nagged. â¢ â¢ '-:*Â»;*?
A few weeks ego a paragraph was
printed In the dally papers telling how
a schoolboy, who had failed In his ex
aminations, committed suicide rather
than go home and confess his failure
and face the nagging he knew would
ensue upon the inevitable confession.
He waa ashamed ' enough of failing,
he confided to his chum, and he would
n't mind a scolding for It, even "a good
scolding," for he knew he deserved It,
but ha knew that ; '/they'd never let up
on it," and he couldn't face that dismal
prospect, so, rather than give his men
tors a change to "begin on it" he killed
himself on the way home. .
One lovely tunny Sunday .morning I
waa called away from tending my gar
den by a detail to tee a fourteen-year
old girl who h&d shot herself with a
rickety Junk-shop pistol.
I found her on one of the narrow
little beds of the emergenoy hospital,
her thin little chest swathed In band
ar** â the bullet still In It, her voice a
mere gasp, her sharp little face ashy
under a profuse peppering of freckles
andt set In resentment.
Oh," but she was a tough little girlâ
picturesque slang her entire vocabu
lary. And she wasn't sorry, not one
little bit sorry that she had shst her
self, and was likely to die.
â¢That," she said, "Is what I want
to do. What's the use o f llvln'? Me big
sister is always a-chewln' de rag. No
matter what youse do fer her â she's al
ways a-chewln' uv de rag. Maybe I
was bid â I brolce.de dishes Instead o'
washln' dem â but a-chewln' uv de rag
ain't never made nobody want to be
good yet."
The resentful little girl died â but her
philosophy lives. .
.Such is the perversity of human na
ture that- nagging, no matter how well
deserved and well intentloned â and the
pity of it Is that very often it Is both â
ever made anybody want to be good.
One-half â nay, three- fourths, four
fifths, of the disappearances that keep
the police busy are the results of nag
ging, the missing, the runaway victims
of naggers, who use this middle course
to escape murder or self-murder.
Lack of courage, want of initiative,
entire subjection keep the remaining
fifth at home, within the zone of the
nagger.
If you doubt it, invite the henpecked
man to sing "Rip Van Winkle was a,
lucky .man. Rip Van Winkle went
away," and hearken to the plaintive
longing he puts into it, to the curious
emphasis which dwells on the name of
the man -who "went away."
Â» â¢ Going to Jail; to avoid being nagged
is almost as- extreme a measure as
.seeking escape in suicide, yet we are
laughing at the spectacle of George D.
Collins pathetically appealing to Detec
tive Gibson, over the Victoria tele
phone, to come after him and take him
to jail to save him from his newest
mother-in-law's tongue.
.Ail San Francisco knows what persist
ence and ingenuity and suppleness Collins
has exercised to keep out of JaiL- The un
happy woman who thinks she knows him
best has declared her belief that he would
die by 'his own hand rather than go to
San Quentin. yet here we iiave him danc
*lrigr with ; impatience before his telephone
In the Hotel Driard until he can get De
tective Gibson to his telephone in : the
Hotel Victoria.
â¢ "Come," 'ne shouts into the receiver.
"Come and get me. I'm ready to go back
with you. For mercy's sake, come! Take
me to jail. Lock me Inâ and my mother
in-law out!" '\u25a0\u25a0..- ,
Collins the Wretched feels that he Is
getting more than his just punishment.
He would rather come back \u25a0 and take
his chances with the law and San Quen
tin than suffer the nagging of his nlmble
tongued Mamma-in-law McCurdy. *
And for the first time In his Iniquitous
career his predicament excites the \ sym
pathy of his fellow men./ '
"Poor Colllnsl" they say. "This IS hard
lines. I hope he'll be able to get Into
jail." ;.
Persiflage aside | and trifling done with,
It is the painful truth that nagging Is. not
only responsible for more ; misery than :
poverty and all the, vices combined; It is
responsible for the vices themselves, and
it has never cured any. of them. . ,
It la no mere figure of speech that It
drives a man to drink. This is one of the
smallest sins of the nagger..
It drives him to^lle and to cheat, to
cringe and to hate." - ; .
You can't tell the truth to the chronlo
nagger; life would be made Intolerable for
the naggee if he did.
You can't be square and open and hon
est and natural . with the nagger. You
must wear the armor plate of ' hypocrisy
' and . pretense and .compliance,;; for ,c the;
nagger will not have you: as you are; you
must | conform to ' the nagger's ideal. \u25a0

dent, clean. Industrious, honest. Bober. ,
self-sacrificing, a' very pattern of a '
woman, and she will do her nagging
with the best Intentions and from thu
highest motives.
That Is the' abominable thing about it.
If she nags at her husband about
taking a convivial glass It is because
he does take a convivial glass. Of
course, he may be none the worse for
Itâ except occasionally'; he might. In
deed, be much tho worse without itâ
Burly, morose and without companion
ship. But he does take the glass, and
sÂ«v she is in" the right The fault U
there to be found. .
If '\u25a0he nags at her husband In asptrit
of Jealousy it Is because he has an ap- j
preciative eye for a pretty woman â for .
other "pretty women. ; It matters not
if It Is a perfectly innocent apprecia
tion. He has the eye. and she is in the . .
right, he can't * deny. So all he can,
do , la j sayâ well, whatever he aays 13
drowned by the slamming of the door.
If she nags at his untidiness again
she Is in the right; there are the proofs
of It â bis shoes In the middle of the
floor for her to fall over; his coat and
trousers." his collar and tie waiting for
her to put them in place.
\u25a0 If he is unpunctual at - mealsâ there
is the clock, and the whistle, if you
don't. believe the clock. And the steak
burned to a crisp, or tho roast to a
cinder to prove It And what does it . ,
matter if he doesn't care very much.
If he Is easy and good natured and eats
the crisp or the cinder with a friend
ly laugh?- He IS unpunctual, and she is
In the right. .
Trifles?
Of course they are trifles. But trifles
are ' what the nagger fastens upon;
trifles of such trifling importance, or
rather.-, unimportance, that they can
make no dent in the peace or happiness
or comfort of the next twenty-four
hours if only they are not magnified in
this. .
What does It matter if Mary* Jane
does break a cup or a plateâ even one
that came over in the Mayflower?
' What does it matter if Johnny does
lose hi a book in a scuffle on his way
home from school, even though it costs'
85 cents to replace it?
.What does it matter if the roast is"
overdone once In a great while, or there
are ashes jon the parlor carpet?
These" small annoyances, and even
the grievous disappointments of life, ~i
pass into the oblivion of the past * as
entirely as the pebble you cast into thu
running stream. There is a ripple on
the surface, then all is smooth again,
unless the ripple is prolonged Into a
whirlpool by nagging. '......
The man wiio nags can show you
right on his side, as well as the woman *
who nags. '
The husband whose, wife keeps - him
waitingâ let us not venture to guess
how long â while she primps and preens
for the theater has right on his side,
and finds justification for his nasty
temper and nastier way of expressing
It in - their , missins the first act of a
new play. \u25a0
-The employer whose employes Jump
at â¢ the aound of his foot \u25a0 In . the i hall
way certainly has tho right to mak*
them, Jump. Ho pays their salaries.
The military martinet has the right
to demand the salute, to Insist on tho
polished buttons. It is so provided in
the service regulations. .
But why, Insist so punctiliously on
your; rights? :.
The, tardy wife is perhaps a vain and
loving woman, who is trying to make
herself; pretty In her lord's eyes.; Tho*
missing of the first act is punishment
enough In Itself, and a -little kindness,
a little compliment for the prettlness
achieved, goes â¢ towards making a
pleasanter evening.
The, employer who sees his employes
\u25a0as human beings usually gets the better,
because the more willing service.
And the officer who Is at the same time
a roan gets the polished buttons .Just'
the same, a salute that is more than \u25a0
perfunctory and a loyal adherence un- .
der the buttons. > .
Being in tha right Is, after all. only
the argument to support nagging. It's I
the spirit .under it 'that makes the nag

ging that makes the \u25a0 world so miser

TM* in the firvt of a new'

with the adventures of the fa

bis wily adversary, Morlarlty,
apparently encompassed the de

which appeared In The Sunday

dealt Â«rttb the adventures of
Sherlock Holmes after his
miraculous escape, and thÂ«
death of Sloriarlty.
Copyright 1805. by McCtare. FhilllpÃ & Co.
OF all the problems which have been
submitted to my friend Mr. Sher
lock Holmes for solution during
the years of our Intimacy, there
were only two which I_ was the means
of Introducing to his noticeâ that of Mr.
Hatherley'e thumb and that of Colonel
Warburton's madness. Of these the lat
ter may have afforded a finer field for
en acute and original observer, but the
other was so strange In its Inception and
\u25a0o dramatic In its details that It may
be the more worthy of being placed upon
record, even if it gave my friend fewer
openings for those deductive methods of
reasoning by which he achieved such re
markable results. The etory has. I be
lieve, been told more than once in the
newspapers, but, like all such narratives,
its effect is much less striking when set
forth en bloo in a single half column of
print than when the facts slowly evolve
before your own eyes and the mystery
clears gradually away as each new dis
covery furnishes a step which leads on
to the complete truth. At the time the
circumstances made a deep impression
upon me, and the lapse of two years
has hardly served to weaken the effect.
It was in the summer of '89, not long
after my marriage, that the events oc
curred which I am now about to sum
marize. I had returned to civil practice,
ud had finally abandoned Holmes in his
Baker-Etreet rooms, although I continu
ally visited him, and occasionally even
persuaded him to forego Ms Bohemian
habits bo far as to come and visit us.
My practice had 'steadily-Increased, and
es I happened to live at no great dis
tance from Paddlngton station, I got a
Tew patients from among the officials.
One of these, whom I had cured of a
jalnful and lingering disease, was never
creary of advertising my virtues, and of
endeavoring to 6end me on every sufferer
over whom he might have any Influence.
One morning at a little before 7 o'clock
I was awakened by the maid tapping
at my door to announce that two men
had come from Paddington, and were
rÂ» ltir.gr In the consulting room. I dressed
hurriedly, for I knew by experience that
railway cases were seldom trivial, and
hastened downstairs. As I descended my
old ally, the guard, came out of the
room and closed the door tightly behind
him. W^i
*Tve got him here," he whispered,
jerking his thumb over his shoulder;
"he's all right."
"What Is It, then?" I asked, for his
manner eugrgested that it was some
strange creature which he had caged In
my room. â¢ .3^ ';
"It's a new patient," he whispered. "I
thought I'd bring him round myself; then
he couldn't slip away. There he Is, all
safe and sound. I must go now,' doctor;
I have my dcotles, just the same as you."
And off he went, this trusty tout, without
even giving me time to thank him.
I entered my consulting-room and
found a gentleman seated by. the table.
He was Quietly dressed In a suit of
heather tweed, with aT Boft cloth cap,
which he had laid down upon my books.
Round one of his hands ne had a hand
kerchief, which was. mottled all over
with blood stains. He was young, not
more than five and twenty, I should say,
with a strong', muscular face; but he was
exceedingly pale, and gave me" the im
pression of a man who was suffering
from some strong agitation, which It took
all his strength of mind to control.
"I am sorry to knock you up so early,
doctor," said he, "but I have had a very
serious accident during the night. I came
in by train this morning, and on Inquiring
at Paddington as to where I might find a
doctor, a worthy fellow very kindly es
corted me here. I gave the maid a card,
but I see that she has left it upon the side
table."
I took It up and glanced at it. "Mr. Vic
tor Hatherley, hydraulic engineer, 16A,
Victoria Btreet (third floor)." That was
the name, style and abode of my morning
visitor. "I regret that I have kept ygu
waiting," said I, sitting down In my li
brary chair. "You are fresh from a night
journey, I understand, which in Itself Is a
monotonous occupation." .
"Oh! my night could not be called mo
notonous," said he, and laughed. He
laughed very heartily, with a high, ring
ing notej leaning back in his chair and
shaking bis sides. All ray medical In
sllncts rose up against that laugh.
"Stop It!" I cried; "pull yourself to
gether!" and I poured out some water
from a carafe.
It vms useless, however. He was off In
one of those hysterical outbursts which
come upon a strong nature when , come
great crisis Is over and gone. Presently
hÂ£ came to himself once more, very weary
and blushing hotly.;.'' \u25a0
"I have been making a fool of myself,"
he gasped.
"Not at aIL Drink this." I dashed
some brandy into the water, and the color
began to come back to hit bloodless
cheeks.
"That's better!" said he. "And how,
doctor, perhaps you would kindly attend
to my thumb, or rather to ' the place
where my thumb used to be."
He unwound the handkerchief and
held out his hand. It gave even my
hardened nerves a shudder to look at
It. There were four protruding fingers
and a horrid red, spongry surface where
the thumb should have been. It had
been hacked or torn right out from the
roots.
"Good heavens!" I cried, "this is a
terrible Injury. It must have bled con;
siderably." N
"Yes, it did. I fainted? when It was
done, and I think that I must have been
senseless for a long time. When I
came to I found that It was still bleed
ing,-so I- tied' one end of my handker
chief very tightly round the \rrist, : and
braced It up with a twig." .
"Excellent! You should have been a
surgeon.V
"It is a question* of hydraulics, you
see. and came within ray . own pro
vince."
"This has been done." said I." examih-
ing the wound, "by a very heavy and
sharp Instrument."
"A thing like a cleaver," said he. ;
"An accident, I presume?"*
"By no means." ,
"Wliat! a murderous attack?"
"Very murderous indeed."
"Yon horrify me."
I sponged the wound, - cleaned , it,
dressed . It, : and finally covered Itwlth
cotton wadding and carbolized ; band
ages. \u25a0\u25a0"'\u25a0 He lay back" without "wincing,
though he bit his V" from tinjeto time..
' "How is that?" I asked, when I^ had,
finished. .5 *
"Capitai! Between your brandy and
your bandage, I feel a new man. I was
very weak, but I have had a good deal
to go through,"
"Perhaps you had better not speak ,
of the matter. It is evidently trying to
your nerves."
"Oh! no, not now. I sfiall have to:
tell, my tale to the police; but,: between-,
ourselves, if it were not f or . the ".f con
vincing, c â¢!' ence of this wound of mine,
I should be surprised if '\u25a0 they,\ believed
my statement; for it. is a very extra
ordinary one, and I have \u25a0 not^ much ; in
the way of proof Ayith which to back it
up; and, even^if, they, believe' me, "the
clews which I can give them are so
vague that It is a question whether jus
tice will be done."
"Ha!" , cried I, ' "if it is anything: in ;
.the nature of a problem which/ you ;de-^
sire to see solved, I should strongly
recommend you to my friend Mr.' Sher-.
lock Holmes before:you*go/ to! the;bfn-;
cial police." / ; . ; '
"Oh! I have heard of. that : fellow,"
answered my visitor, "and I should; b'e :
very Blad if he would take the matter"
up, though of course I must use the
.; ofiicial police as well. .Would'ybu give
me an introduction to him?" ; .
/ "I'll do ' better. I'll take you round
to him: myself." â¢
â¢VI should be immensely obliged to you.'.'

In cool blood I was very much astonished,
as you may both think, at this sudden
commission which bad been intrusted to
me. On the one hand, of course, I was*
glad, for the fee was at least tenfold
what Z should have asked had I set a
price upon my own services, and - it : was
possible that this order might lead to .
other one?. - On the other- hand the face
and manner ot my patron had made an
unpleasant Impression upon me. and I
could not think that his explanation of the*
fuller's earth was sufficient to explain
the necessity for my coming at midnight, *
and his extreme anxiety lest I should tell
any one of my errand. However. I threw
all fears to the winds, ata a hearty sup
per, drove to Paddlngton and started off.
having obeyed to the letter the- injunc
tion as to holding my tongue!. ,
"At Reading I had to change not only â¢
my carriage, but my station. However.
I was in time for the last train to Eyf ord,
and I reached the little dim-lit station
after II o'clock. I was tho only passes-^*
ger.who got out there, and there was no'
one upon the> platform save a slngrls
sleepy porter with a lantern. As I passed
; out through the wicket gate, however. I
found my acquaintance of the morning
waiting in the shadow upon the other
side. Without a word he grasped my arm '
and hurried me into a carriage, the door
of which , was standing open. He drew
up the windows on either side, tapped on
\he woodwork, and away we went as fast
as the hor so could go."
"One horse?" Interjected Holmes.
"Yes, only one."
"Did you observe the color?"
"Yes. I saw It by the side-lights when
Z was stepping into the carriage. It was
a chestnut."
"Tlred-looklnr or fresh T"
"Oh. fresh and glossy."
"Thank you. I am sorry to have inter
rupted you. Pray continue 'your most
intsrestlnz statement." \u25a0* . . >r",^!f
"Away -we 'went then, drove
for at least an hour; ' Colonel Lyaander
Btark had said that it was only seven
miles, but I should think, from the rate
that we' seemed to go, and from the
tima that -we took, that It must have
been nearer twelve. Ho sat at my side *
In silence- all the time, and I was aware,
more than once, .when I ' glanced In his
direction, that he was looking at me
with great Intensity. The country roads \u2666
seem to be not very good in that part
of the world, for we lurched and jolted
terribly. I tried to look out of the win
dows to see something of where we were.
but they were made of frosted glass, and â¢
I could make out nothing save the occÂ»--,>*
Blonal bright blur of a ? passing light. V,
Now and then I hazarded somo remark
to break the monotony : of the journey,
but the colonel answered only in mono
syllables and . the conversation soon
flagged. At last. \u25a0 However, the* bumpinc
of the road was exchanged for the crisp
smoothness qf a gravel 'drive, and the
carriage, came to a stand. Colonel Ly
sander Stark sprang -out. and, aa 1 fol
lowed after him. pulled me- swiftly into
a porch which gaped in front ot us. We
stepped, as it were, right out of the.
carriage and Into ' the hall, so that Z
failed to catch ' the most fleeting glance
of ..the front of the nous*. The Instant
that I had crossed the threshold thÂ« door
slammed heavily behind us and I heard
faintly the rattle of tha " wheels aa thÂ« *
carriage drove away.
"It ; was pitch dark msidÂ» the sous*
and the s colonel fumbled about ; looking
for matches and muttering under his
breath. Suddenly a door, opened at the.
; other end of the passage* and ' a long*

gave each a start that the, lamp nearly A

up to her, whispered something in her

"Suddenly, without any preliminary
sound in tne midst of the utter ; still
ness, the door of my room swung
suddenly open. The woman was stand
ing in the aperture, the darkness of
the hall behind her. tlje yellow light
from ray lamp beating upon her -eager
and beautiful face.: I could see at a
glance that ehe was sick With fear,
and the sight sent a chill to my own
heart She held up one shaking finger
to warn me to be silent and she shot
a few whispered words of broken Eng
lish at me, her es*es glancing back; like
those of a frightened horse. Into the
gloom behind her.
" *I would go,' said she, trying hard,
as It seemed to me, to speak calmly; 'I
would go. I should not stay here.

" *But madam,' Eald L .'I have not yet

6he went on. "You can pass through
the door: no one hinders.' And then,
seeing that I smiled and shook my
head, ahe suddenly threw aside her con
straint and made a step forward, with
her hands wrung together. 'For the
love of heaven!' she whispered, 'get
away from here before it is too late.!'
"But I am somewhat headstrong by
nature, and the more ready to engage
in an affair when there Is some ob
stacle in the way. I thought of my
fifty-guinea fÂ«e, of my wearisome jour
ney, md of the unpleasant night which
seemed to be before me. Was It all to
go for nothing? Why should I slink
away without having carried out my
commission and without the payment
which was my due? This woman might
for all 1 knew, be a monomaniac. With
a stout bearing, therefore, though her
manner had shaken me more than I
cared to confess. I still shook my head,
and declared my Intention of remaining
where I was. She was about to renew
her entreaties when a door slammed
overhead, and the sound of several
footsteps were heard upon the stairs.
She listened for an Instant threw up
her hands with despairing gesture, and
vanished as suddenly and as noiselessly
as ehe had come.
"The new-comers were, Colonel Ly
sander Stark and a short, thick man
with a chinchilla beard growing out of
the creases of his double chin, who was
introduced to me as Mr. Ferguson. .
" "This is my secretary and manager."
said the coloneL "By the way. I was
under the impression that -I left this

have felt the draught*
*"On the contrary,' said L 'I opened
the door myself because I felt the room
to be a little dose."
"He shot one of his. suspicious looks
at me. 'Perhaps we had better pro

politics talked by and to the pub
lic. But he evaded, without .seem
ing to do so, all the ingenious
traps I laid for drawing from
him some admission that would. give me
a clew to where he "fitted in." I learned
no more about him than I thought ha
learned about me.
"I hope we shall meet again,", said ]
cordially, as we parted at the cab-itand.
"Thank you," he answered, and after
ward I remembered the faint smile in. his
eyes. '
I, of course, knew that Roebuck was
greatly interested In my project for put
ting political business on a business basis;
but not until he had explained why he
sent for me did I see how it had
fascinated and absorbed his mind. "You
showed me," he began, "that you musi
have under you a practical man to handle
the money and do the arranging with the
heelers and all that Bort. of thing."
"Yes," eaid I; "it's a vital part of thâ¬
plan. We must find a man who is per
fectly trustworthy and discreet - Neces
sarily he'll know or suspect eomething
not much, but still somethingâ of the in
sde workings of the combine."
1 "Well. Tve found him," went on Roe
buck, In a triumphant tone. "He's a god
less person, with no character to lose, and
no conception of what character means.
But he's straight as a string. Providence
seems to have provided such \u25a0 men fOlf 01
Just such situations as these, where the
devil must be fought with fire. " I've been
.testing him for nearly fifteen years. But
-you can Judge for yourself."
I was the reverse of pleased. It wai
not In my calculations to have a creature
of Roebuck's foisted upon me, perhapsâ
indeed, probablyâ a Â«py. I purposed to
choose my own man; and I- decided while
he was talking, that I would accept tba
Roebuck selection only to drop him on
some plausible pretext before we began
operations. I was to meet ;. the man at
dinnerâ Roebuck had engaged a suite jat
the Auditorium. "It wouldn't do to have
him at.; my "house or club," '\u0084. said -, he;
"neither do we want to be seen .with

was both astoniÃhed and chagrined when
we shook, hand* and : greeted each other
like old friends.'* _;
"How do you do, Mr. Sayler?" said
Woodruff. v-Ki'-v^ â.
"Glad to see â¢ you, Doctor . Woodruff, '
I replied. "Then! you. knew! me ail the
time? Why didn't you; speak out? We
might have had an hour's business talk
in the train." j | M '-\u25a0\u25a0'
"If I'd shown myself as leaky as all
that, I guess there'd have. been no busi

that ha was at least a.fellow-country

"Colonel Lysander , Stark stopped at

locked. Within was 'a \u0084 small,/; square

" 'We are now,' â¢ said he, \u25a0 'actually
within the hydraulic press, and it
would be a particularly unpleasant
thing for us if any one were- to; turn It
on. The ceiling .of this small* chamber
Is really the end of the descending:pis

of it and It: has lost ; a little of f.lts
force. Perhaps you/will have the good

"I took the lamp 'from him and exam
ined the machine very/ thoroughly./: It
was indeed a gigantic one -and 'Capable
of exercising enormous; pressure. 1 ; When
I passed . outside, however, and pressed
down the levers which controlled it, I
knew at once by the whistling' sound
that there was a Blight leakage which
allowed a > regurgltatlon of water
through one of the side cyiinderc." An
examination showed that one of the
India-rubber : bands ; which was round
the head of , the driving rod had/ shrunk
so as to not quite fill the socket along
which It worked. This was clearly 'the
cause of the loss of power, and I point

Continued .Vext Sunday.)IS THIS THE "NEW REVELATION"?
18 this the New Revelation, prophe
sied by the Christ, and awaited pray
erfully by many peoples of the earth?
If It Is not. the Bahai Revelation,
now numbering its nine millions of
adherents gathered from every race and
religion of the earth, at least bears a
singular resemblance to that foretold. ln
-the New Testament It demands now,
and will presently compel, the serious
consideration of every seeker after truth.
Bixty years ago the Forerunnerâ the John
tke Baptist of the new faithâ arose. Since
that time it is asserted has appeared the
revelation of God the Father, the new
revelation of God the Son now living at
Acca In Syria. Twenty-five thousand mar
tyrs have given their life for their faith;
miracles of overwhelming magnitude are
tald to have taken place: biblical and
other religious prophecies are said to
have been fulfilled to the letter; and a re
awakening of faith in God and lovÂ» to
ward man unprecedented In history has
â¢ come to pass. Buddhists, Christiana,
Jews, Confucians, Mohammedans, Zoroas
trians. worship together In the new House
cf Gofl. The atheist has found a God.
Euch, it Is claimed, and the evidence is
compelling, are the manifestations of the
new religion.
Like most faiths, the Bahai Revelation
had its origin In the East. Its history be
gan sixty years ago with the uprising of
-Mirza All Mohammed In the city of-Te
heran. Persia, Mlrza AH Mohammed, aft
erward known as the Bab, which means
the "gate" or "doorj" was a young mer
chant of what Is known as the pure line
age, a descendant of the Prophet Moham
med, and by religion a Mohammedan.
Though remarkable always for his purity
and devoutness and also for a singular
physical beauty, nothing of extraordinary
nature characterized his career until his
twenty-fifth year. At that time he began
to declare himself the herald of a new
manifestation of God. Though almost
\u25a0wholly uneducated, he began to write
and to preach, urging men to prepare for
the coming again of God upon earth. He
wrote a series of works upon the Koran,
in all appealing for aid to the unseen di
vinity, of whom, he proclaimed himself
the herald.
Followers began to gather about the
Bab. The high priests of his city, at this
time Shiraz, began to note the movement
\u25a0with disfavor. Eloquent, fiery, earnest,
the young prophet soon attracted many
converts. It was not very long before the
religious authorities, alarmed for their
Bupn.uacy, deu. mined to suppress him.
He was summoned to appear before them
to grive account of himself. History has It
that he confounded his examiners with
the wisdom and knowledge of his dis
course. Commanded to appear at the
mosque of Fars to recant, he preached in
Euch fashion as to silence. utterly his op
ponents and to gain many new converts
to his doctrines. The faith \ began to be
noised abroad, and the alarm . of the old
dispensation to become greater. Contume
ly of all kinds was in consequence heaped
upon the Uab aud his followers; Impris
onments, beatings, persecutions â cul
rninatingr at last in the martyrdom of
the Bab and many others â became their
lot.
At length the young prophet was or
dered to appear before the Shah at
Teheran, at the instigation of the high
priests. Like another ruler of old.
however. Muhammed Shah declared
that he "found no. harm In this man,"
dismissed him, and gave him a staff
and money to go on his way. . This
leniency ttill further alarmed the au
thorities,' and from religious they, be
can â¢to make political accusations
against him, representing the prophet
as a leader of sedition.
For seven years, thus hounded from
one place to another, the- Bab preached
and. prophesied, and then was shot by a
company of soldiers July 9, 1850. Tha
manner of his death was foretold la
Mohammedan prophecies several cen
turies before the Invention of gunpow
der, and he himself prophesied six
months before its occurrence Its exact
date., and manner. â
After this, the : persecutions became
more; violent. Whole villages suspect
ed of -Babisra were, burned to the ground.
The victims were despoiled of all their
\u25a0wealth. '^Jiey .were hanged, shot,. put to
the . sword. 'In some Instances holes
â¢were made in the living body and light
ed candles i placed therein. In such
fashion . have. 23.000 people In Persia
been done to death, but nothing -has
availed to stem the growth of the new

THE IDEAL AMERICAN
THERE Is a great difference between
the. coronation of a King and the
Inauguration- of a President of a
republic. That difference lies not
alone In the nature of the cere
monial and Its. accompanying pageant
but Id the fundamental significance of
the act. In the one case it la the
recognition of and acquiescence In the
hereditary rights of a ruling, and -select
class.' In the other it is the conferring
by the people of temporary priv
ileges on one of their own number, a man
like unto themselves. Presumably they
choose- for this high honor; one who rep
resents the best elements In /the nation's
life, one to whom they are glad to have

In 1890 Mr. Browne visited Acre, where
Baha -Ullah ' was : confined, an exile from
Persia." The" visit made : an extraordin
ary, Impression upon him. and he thus
-; recounts' it: .'
\u25a0â¢ : "Though â¢ I â¢ dimly suspected whither I
was going and whom I was to behold
(for no distinct intimation had been given
to me) a second or. two elapsed ere, .with \u25a0
a throb of wonder and : awe, I became'
conscious that â¢ the room was- not unten
anted. In the corner .where the divan
met the wall sat a wondrous, and vener
able" figure,' crowned with a felt hat
of the kind called taj by dervishes (but
of unusual height and make) round the
base of which was wound a small white
turban. Tho face of him on whom I
gazed I can never forget, though I
cannot describe It. Those piercing eyes
seemed to read one's very soul; power
and authority sat oiT that ample brow;
while the deep lines on the forehead and
face implied an eye which the jet-black
- hair and beard flowing down in Indis
tinguishable luxuriance almost to the
waist seemed to beue. No need to ask
in whose presence I stood, as I bowed
myself before one who is the object of
a devotion j and love 'â which kings mlghj
envy and -emperors sigh [for In vain!
"X "mild and dignified voice bade me
'. be seated . and then i continued: 'Praise
be to God that thou hast attained! . . .
Thou hast come to see a prisoner and an
exile. 1 . : . \ We desire v but the good of
the world and the ; happiness : of the na
tions ;"â¢ yet they deem us a stlrrer up of
\u25a0 strife- and sedition worthy of bondage
and -i banishment: . . . That all na
tions ; should : ! become one in faith and
all men as -brothers; that the bonds of
affection and: unity between the sons of
â¢ men â¢ ' should -be : strengthened ; that di
versity "of religions should cease and dif
ferences-of race should be annulledâ
â¢ whatf harm: is \u25a0\u25a0 there -in this? Tet so It
' shall â¢: be; 'these fruitless S strifes, these
ruinous Wars shall pass away, and the
most " Great ' Peace shall come. . . .
\u25a0 Do : you '< not In Europe need this also?
Is not -this -that which Christ foretold?
.Â»'.â¢.- Yet do we see- your kings and
rulers lavishing,, their treasures more
freely" on means for destruction of the
human . race than on that which would
conduce to the happiness of mankind.
... These strifes and this bloodshed
and discord must cease, and all men be
as one kindred and one family. Let
not a man glory in this, that he loves
his country; let him rather glory in this,
that he loves his kind.'
"Such; so far. as I can recall them, were
the words iwhich;- besides many others.
'I heard ; from r Ãaha. .Let those who read

ISI7, of a Ion? line of Persian Princes. To
Nushirvan the. Just, back to the ancient
King Cyrus of biblical history, his descent
is traced. In lS^. Uwo years after the
death of the Bab. Baba Ullah. his family
and many Babis. were exiled to Basaad
after, being stripped of all their posses
sions. In Bagdad they remained in peace
for twelve years, winning an extraor
dinary love and devotion from all with
whom '< hey came in contact. Converts
were made In extraordinary numbers, and
the Babis were again exiled to prevent
the growth of the movement. This time
the exi!e3 were sent to Constantinople. It
was the same story here. To Adrlanople
they were next removed, and the mani
festations here, being even more remark
able, the Mohammedan clergy - appealed
to the Turkish and Persian governments
to d.spose of the Babis in such wise that
they could do no further harm to the es
tablished church. The appear was suc
cessful and the Babis were exiled to
Acca, the Ahka of ancient history, a
Turkish penal city and notoriously un
healthful. th"c city . foul and unfit for
human life,, the surroundings a desert..
.The miracle that took place here Is now
a matter of history. From a death-trap
tho town of Acca has become a fair and
gracious city, the arid Acre plain, as
Browns himself describes it, a "wealth
-of, beautiful gardens and fragrant orange
groves such as I little expected -to find in
what" Baha has stigmatized as the most
desolate of countries." Not only Acca.
it is claimed, has shown so strange and
miraculous Improvement, but all of Pal
estine.
Here, at Acca. Baha Ullah lived for
twenty-four years, his death, referred ta
by the Bahals as "The Day of .Depart
ure," taking place on May 23. 1533.
r " Abbas Effendi. known to tho Bahals as
the "Servant of God tho Master, the Christ
manifestation, is the eldest son of Baha
Ullah. and was by him appointed as his
successor. Abdul Baha Is now living, at
Acca, a prisoner of the Turkish Govern
ment. Abdul Baha was born in 1344 U at
Teheran, and has practically been a pris
oner all his life. The manifestations of
his career have been In curious conform
ity with the life of Christ. Arthur Pills
bury Dodge, one of the many American
pilgrims to Acca, says of him In an article
upon the Baha! Revelation, in "Mind of
February last,, that he "found from act
ual experience, which coincided with in
formation previously and ever since then
received, that Abdul Baha continuously
and unchangeably lived a life of love,
service. - humility and sacrifice, â¢.â¢ â¢
taking up and continuing with the added
strength â¢ and clearness promised by
Christ, . His Life. "Works and Teachings
from tlie suspension thereof by Crucifix
ion nineteen years ago!"
Such 13 the testimony continually given.
Miracles are asserted to be 'taking pfttce
every dayâ though -upon tnls the Bahals
place the j least : possible weight, and . pil
grims from all '" countries are continually
arriving at Acca to go away to spread the
new revelation.
What Bahalsm Is exactly we are
here shortly to Know.' Like the plays?
the fashions, the everything else, San
Francisco gets even its : religions . late.
It was' In : ISSS that- Baha Ullah sent
letters to. the, rulers of nations iXt T $~
claiming _ his "divinity." Queen â¢ .Victoria
personally replied:' "If v this Is the
truth Jt will stand." ' Napoleon sent" ail
Insolent answer and- was again* ap
pealed to. the second letter containing
the prophecy of \u25a0 his banishment and
death in exile. The Czar sent a repre
sentative, in reply: and Russia now
has a temple dedicated to the new
faith. Grant" was then- President, but
the letter to the American potentate was
lost. .- ' .

exciting- to the players and to the ponies,
and to the E^ectators as wellâ the ponies
are ttn-ned out Into a ftne. large pasture
and are taking a complete rest. They
are not molested by grooms or irritated
with carry cotnbs, but are simply getting
themselves into good condition and in
readiness for the polo season when it
opens.
la talking about the ponies, I had the
advantage of having a mind almost en
tirely blank and in a reeeative condition,
being absolutely end innocently ignor
ant of any of the attributes or charac
teristics that are required to make up
a good polo pony. And my first ques
tion was. <{u!te naturally, what kind or
breed of horse the polo pony was. I
â¢was somewhat astonished when Mr. Don
nelly told me that a polo pony was mere
ly en individual horse, without any par
ticular antecedents or pedigree.
If it can be seen that he meets the re
quirements necessary to play polo, it is
not necessary to look him up on the
"stud book," nor to make any inquiries
as to bis race and pedigree, but it is
advisable to buy him and try him out
for his qualifications, and then train him
for the part he is to play in the game.
First-class ponies are not often to be
had, but when they do happen lo be
offered the polo player should be ready
to secure them without regard to the
season or to his immediate -wants. : 'Â».' :
Of course Mr. Donnelly referred to first
class ponies in all thisâ and to animals
that had already been trained, at least
to some extent, enough, certainly, to
show that they would become first class.
Such ponies as these are not within the
means of any bat the rich, but we were
looking then at reaily good and experi
enced ponies, and naturally were speak
ing only of the first-class animals.
Mr. Donnelly gave me some pointers < in
case 1 should ever want to buy any such
precious little animals, as to how to make
my selection, and. although for the pres
ent I do not see any occasion to make
use of the information, still, it is good to
know something about them.
He said that a polo pony should be
only a trifle over fourteen hands highâ
that at anything taller than that the pony
was harder to train, and was not so quick
nor so handy in the field. Then he should
have good, strong shoulders that will
carry him down a hill on a sharp gallop.
Next, the neck must be fairly long, as a
pony with a short neck is hard to turn
and requires more pulling.
Then the back must be short and
strong, with a good depth in the middle
and wide and flat across the loins. The
legs, of course, must be strong, and the
bocks well let down right under him.
The forelegs are very important, and
\u25a0hculd hare plenty of bone â hoofs strong,
â¢dcs concave and frogs well developed.
The eyes should be calm and gentle, and
the expression intelligent. An uneasy,
restless or staring expression is a pretty
cure indication of undesirable qualities for
the polo pony.
This last suggestion reminded me that
mb* yean ago I was told that the horses
lKsught for the use of Wells, Fargo &
Co.'c express were always carefully se
lected fcr their Intelligence of expression
tad thÂ» quiet, kind look of their eyes.
I was naturally very much interested
In Mr. Donnelly's description of the real
polo ponies, and piled Mm with a great
many <raestions, betraying my own Igno
rance to a fearful degree, but without
disturbing his urbanity or his kindness in
Instructing me.
â¢He said that a polo pony might be of
English, Arabian, American. Mexican or
InUan breedâln fact, anything that an
ew-re the requirements of build and is
fast and Intelligent. The English ponies
he ccrslCtred the best, but after them the
American, and of the American, the beet
were probably toe California ponies.
Mr. F. J. Mackey** pony "Rex" is
famous â¢very where that polo is
played, and he la known as a California
Pony.
Mr. Richard Tobln's pony, "Pajaro." is
a beautiful animal, and a fine 'example of
\u25a0what a first-class polo pony should be.
The Tobta boys are all polo players, and
of course all of them own poniesâ the
ponle* I west to see the other day in
Ean Mateo. Although they were all out
tn the pasture, still I could see what beau
tiful little creatures they were. I think
that the finest one there was "Pajaro,"
which I believe 1Â« Mr. Richard Tobin' â¢
favorite pony.
He is finely proportioned and of . Just
the right height and build, and the Intel- r
ligence that illumines his face and his '
kind and "gentle eye show ' that he *is
a perfect pony.
It Is not, to be expected that one little
pony ; can play through a whole gameâ
the work Is too fact. too violent,. and too
strenuous for that, although sometimes
one - pony will manage to play the first
and third periods of a game, resting *
during the second period. But he must
be an exceptionally good and strong pony
to do as much as that. Polo players
most, therefore, have several ponies for ;
their mounts even in a single game. .
Mr. Richard Tobin has four ponies now.
ss â Pajaro, Lsddas. Prince and PeU : They
are all, fine 'animals and all good players,
for the ponies enter, into the spirit of the
game, and , actually play it with almost
the . same gusto , as , their riders.
Mr. Tobin â¢Is * very, cartful of his little
ponies. He does not overwork them, and
he rides them \u25a0 with ,a" firm but - gentle
hand.
How important . that point is ;no one ; ,
c*ti know but one who is used to rid
teg. I remember that- when I lived - Jn ' ,
the country there were two. boys living i
By
oHÃlizabeth AtneS.
near us who were on horseback nearly
every day and who were equally good
riders, but when they returned from a
hard ride one of the horses was always
restive, chafed, uneasy and hot, while
the other, whose rider had a gentle hand, I
would be fresh and quiet. The only dif
ference was in the hand that guided
them.
In playing polo, particularly, a heavy
hand is bad for the pony, and some of ,
them come in quite done up, while
others, although hot, are in fairly good,
condition. ' '"\u25a0
I have watched a good many games.
of poloâ an interested, breathless and ex
cited spectatorâ admiring the activity, and",
alertness of the ponies and the skill and -
pluck, of the riders and their splendid ''.
horsemanship, but without any very defl-
nite knowledge of the rules of the game. l
It has often seemed to me cruel to see .
the use '_of the spurs; on' the"' ponies',-^
flanks, with the blood. flowing down and
the occasional . whack of the â¢ mallet on ~
the poor little animal's headâ but it ap- "\u25a0
peared to be "all ' In the game." and no ; .
particular harm done after all; "Now, one 1
of my questions to Mr. Donnelly/.; al
though I knew it was an unnecessary.-',
one, was if it were really, necessary; to,"
maltreat the ponies â¢on the ' field. Of j
course, he answered that it .was not~\
and that what had seemed to me to be <
cruelty was noY of 'any moment and
hardly felt or noticed - by '\u25a0 the ponies In 1
the excitement of the gameâ and that the |
ponies were well taken' care of, and. In
fact, coddled at its close. . . _"\u25a0 â¢ " \

keeping a house thoroughly
sweet, especially !u summer, that
it should be part of every house
keeper F creed to keep vigilant watch
over all the little out-of-the-way cor
ners so easily overlooked.
Pipes and drainage should be con
stantly looked to, and every little while
come disinfectant should be poured in
sinks and basins â oftener, of course. In
summerâ but at intervals through the
whole year.
Flower vases should never be left
with withering flowers and stale water
in themâ nothing gives off so unpleasant
an uaur as nvgn-cted vases, if you
haven't time to put fresh water In every
day, and to get rid of any but perfectly
fresh flowers, don't attempt to have
them around.
Food receptacles require most care of
all. Refrigerators should be kept per
fectly clean, and anything that has a
strong, pungent flavor that is put into
your refrigerator should be kept In a
covered dish. Otherwise it is apt not
only to share its flavor with every
thing . lse. but to leave an odor In the
refrigerator hard to get rid of.
The drip-pan should be watched and
emptied daily. Never let the pan over
flow, for a place under the refrigerator
allowed to be constantly damp may re
eult in an unpleasant, unhealthy odor.
Bread-boxes and cake-boxes should be
aired frequently. The best way is to
put them out in the sun and leave them
for the greater part of a day. Even the
new kinds of bread-boxesâ those with
ventilators at the endsâ need this air

TOMATOES AND HOW TO PREPARE THEM
DICTIONARIES and bota
, nisti have repeated so
often and so positively j
that the tomato was un
known as a table vegetable fifty
years ago that we have fallen easily
into this belief. Denman Thompson
makes the mature lovers in "The
Old Homestead" say "Folks used to
call them love Apples,' and never
thought of eating them." Even that
tower of linguist strengthâ the Cen
tury Dictionaryâ records that the
tomato "was known only as 9 cur
iosity in the United States until
about 1830." Whereas, 1 have in my
possession a well-worn copy of "The
Virginia Housewife," prepared by
31rs. Marcia Randolph, a noted do
mestic authority in her day, and
published by a Richmond bookseller '
in 1828. This volume contains re
cipes for cooking the tomato in
various ways. Mrs. Randolph writes
the word "tomata," but is thor
oughly familiar with stews, soups
end catsup founded upon this escu
lent. I doubt if the "oldest inhab
itant" of the Southern, and Middle
States, whoso memory remains un
impaired by years, can recall the
time whenthe tomato was cultivated
in his father's garden as merely a
curiosity.
It us, nevertheless.^ true 1 that its
virtues are not Appreciated at their
full by many intelligent cooks, ! and
that few of us know anything of the
antecedent of our "interesting.vege-;
table." Like the potato, it was born
on this side of tie Atlantic, carried
over the water to the eastern conti
nent and brought back to us with
the European stamp "upon it. It was
imported from' South America into
Morocco earl;' in the sixteenth cen-.
tury ; into Italy from Morocco*; into
France f rora Italy ; - into England
from France. The Italians named it
"Porno Dei Mori" (Morocco apple): :
The French called it;<

tion having crept after it . from
Italy^ that' it -entered into the com
position of lovs philters:
It would 1 be a curious, study to
trace the processes by which Eng
lish. cooks discovered its. gastro
nomic values. In the absence of data
bearing upon this point we hkve;tb
thank the anonymous benefactor for
one of our most palatable and
wholesome vegetables that come to
our I tables. It is ' slightly, laxative,
cooling 'to the blcod, and as it con
tains a minute quantity "of calomel;
is a valuable antiscorbutic. Alto:
gcther, its.history and its properties
justify us in devoting the whole of
this talk to our pseudo "love apple."

GOOD TASTE
AND JUDGMENT IN
HOME FURNISHING
ByM.E. Carter
Copyright.' 1905.' by A. S. Barnes & Cot
ALMOST as much depends upon the
' , good taste and judgment exer
cised as upon the amount of
... -money expended in furnishing *\u25a0
house. \u25a0 \u25a0 \u25a0\u25a0. â¢ - *.
Usefulness and beauty should go hand
In hand, as far as possible, in making
selections.. But the useful should always
'lead' the way. One thing to bÂ«* stu
diously avoided is overfurnishing. No
matter how ample the purse, the ruling
Idea should be to furnish with the few
est articles that are not absolutely, of
some use. and to shun crowding things,
things to occupy space' without making
adequate return for so doing. , A room
encumbered - with ! furniture and * orna
ments \u25a0is inelegantâ far ' from pleasing
and a weariness to the- eye that enjoys
refined furnish ingrJ which can only *>â¢
â¢ reached by the observance of the eter
nal fitness of things. First, then, make
usefulness the .paramount point, and
always as much beauty as Is consistent
with us*\ Last of 'all, the ornamental,
which. . if. wisely . chosen, may be also
useful, in. its own way because serving
a purpose, since whatever brightens life
or cheers the workaday toilers is use
ful. . . \u25a0 \u25a0 . ....
.'.'.'\u25a0 THE TOOL BOX
Among ', Immediately .necessary and
strictly - useful purchases is a box â¢of
household tools.' The. v woman .who can
handle a hammer. : a screw driver and a
gimlet expertly will often bo independent
f of. a skilled carpenter or an upholsterer,
when another. person likewise situated,
but unaccustomed .to those tools, .would
-behelpless-r-compelled to wait and wait
the pleasure and the leisure of a me
chanic for trifling jobs to be done., and
' then pay and >ay, in inverse ratio to thÂ«
character, of the work tardily accom
plished, as well as the time taken to do
it. Hiring small jobs done at odd times
- makes surprising inroads upon a family
purse. .If one is entirely dependent upon
mechanics for everything done requiring
their, tools, the best way to keep t hÂ«
cost down to reasonable figures is ' ta
make a full list of what you expect done
and give it to, the man. or hla boss la
advance; of the day that he is to come.
Then he can come prepared with all that \u25a0
the work. may. require. in the way ot*
tools and other necessary, ef cetera.
Everybody " . knows the Â» facility with
..which mechanics lenthen- a bill If they
have .to. go after- anything that is not
â¢ ready to their hands. They never rup
ture . any â¢ blood vessels " by undue hasts
~ when upon those errands. \u25a0* \u25a0\u25a0*\u25a0- . \u25a0 \u25a0 â¢
The household tool box should ac
companied by the stepladders,' a few
kitchen chairs and other things, already
mentioned in a former chapter, for the)
.use of the cleansers. /; The furniture can
be selected as early as you choose, but
with the understanding that' the 'dealers
hold! it .subject to'your 'orders. Tha

A Definite Acceptance or Regret
By Eleanor B. Clapp.
(Copyright, 1906, by A- S. Barmes & Co.)
THE acceptance to an Invitation
should be definite. It is extreme
ly bad form, as well as a de
cided rudeness, to one's would
be hostess to write: "I shall be delight
ed to accept your kind invitation for
the fifteenth of February If my health
permits,** or something of that sort. If
there la any doubt of one's ability to at
tend, a regret should be sent.
Another engraved form of invitation
. that Is often used for big dances runs as
follows:
Mrs. James Gray Worthing
Miss Worthing
AT HOME
Friday, March twentieth
at half-past ten o'clock
Dancing % 1582 North Broadway
. In this case the acceptance or regret
should always be written in the third
person, and the same forms can be used
â¢as those recommended on the preceding
pages for Invitations to private balls and
dances.
Invitation to an Evening Beception.
If the word "Dancing" was omitted
from the corner of the card, exactly the
came form of invitation as the one Just
given could be used Tor an evening re
ception, which is very similar to an elab
orate afternoon reception,' except for the
; fact that the guests and host and host
ess are in evening dress. Sometimes at
these bJg receptions, where old and
, young are both invited in large num
bers, "after a certain hour dancing is in
dulged in by the younger element. If
this is to be the case, the Invitation
should be worded exactly like the one to
Which reference has been made, but in
stead of having engraved In" one corner
the word "Dancing," which. would show
that the affair was to be simply a ball,
the expression "Dancing at" twelve," or
"Cotillon after Supper," should take its
place, thus denoting that the earlier part
of- the evening would be devoted to a
formal- reception.
Informal Dances.
An engraved . invitation always pre
supposes a" largo and more or lees clab
- orate function. For smaller dances it
is getting to be the fashion to send out
Invitations on visiting cards. The host
ess-uses her ordinary calling card and
writes upon it in ink, below her name:
Dancing at half after nine,
February fourth.
R. S. V. P.
The four letters "R S. V. P." are the
initials / of , the"* French ' sentence, "Re
pondez, s'il vous plait," which, as every-
body^ knows, means "Answer,; If you
please," and are necessarily put on such*
Invitations because, as a -general rule,
invitations on visiting cards require no
answers. The acknowledgment of such
an invitation can either, be written for
mally in the third person, or It can take
the form of a more intimate note in the
first person, beginning, "My Dear Mrs.
Blank," and. ending, "Cordially ' yours,
Mary Gray," or whatever the' writers
name may be.
Invitations for Card Parties.
For card parties or small musicales
the same sort of invitations can be sent
out," the word "Cards," "Progressive
Euchre" or "Pit,", or any game, that
has been decided upon for the entertain
ment, being 'written upon the." card. If
it is a musicale that is to be given, the
word "Musicale" or "Music" is written
in the lower left-hand corner,, of" the
card. The answers to such invitations
to card parties should take the form of
short notes .written as just' described for
dance Invitations on visiting cards. The
summons to a musicale should, if- it
takes place in the evening, be similarly
acknowledged; if In the afternoon. It
requires- no answer,; being In the same
category as an afternoon tea. But, : of
course, if one is unable to attend, one
sends cards on the day of the function,
as Is the rule for teas or afternoon re
ceptions.

WOMEN'S WAYS OF EARNING MONEY

When Baby Takes Cold: What to Do
By YDr. \Emelyn '-L.'<, Coolidge
. â¢ o Copyright, 1 1305, ' by 'A. S. Barnes * Co.
S' OME babies seem to take cold on
' the slightest provocation. X This
.- ; is often due to the . fact that
\u0084â .they have 'been kept in too
warm a room \or have been clothed
too ; \u25a0 warmly ; / \ they then get easily
overheated ;v and i: feel the slightest
draught of "air. At^night keep the nurs
ery at a^ temperature of 60 to 63 degrees
"F.; in the" day time, at 68 to' 70 degrees F.
Have S the - nursery", thermometer V hung
about 'the level of the baby's head when
he is in "his! crib. ;p'--v l\- r
When the baby has a cold and his nose
seems" to be stopped upTtwist a piece of
cotton on a wooden, toothpick, dip It In
olive oil and lnsert'it a little way into
each. nostril. A preparation of : oleo
stearate of zinc . and â¢ a special dropper
for use i with it \ may be bought at some
drug stores,' and is .excellent to use for
the ; baby's nose ;when ' It is troublesome
during a'cold.'; If the trouble. la' so great
.that the baby" nurses with difficulty, buy
a nose syringe having a soft rubber tip,
and \u25a0, syringe* out ) the < nose \u25a0 once \u25a0or twice
daily with the Vfollbwing:. Half â¢ a .tea
spoonful of boric acid powder, one ounce
-of fglycerine and : elght ; ounces of warm
water.", -
In order to syringe out a child's nose,
place him ,. in your \u25a0 lap,' with . his back
against your chest," > then â¢ bend . his head
iwell forward and ; syringe , first one nos
trlV then" the^bther.'
Croup.
;, When : the baby coughs; or â¢ has much
â¢ wheezing in his chest, 1 * a mustard plaster
will \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 sometimes 'do - a great ; deal . to re
lieve j him. , To .make" this , plaster, take
one partof mustard to six parts of flour,
mix it -Into a smooth paste with a little
cold , water," and spread" It between'Ltwo
layers *of muslin, then warm it by hold
\u25a0-\u25a0 ing it near the : fire or: moisten it with a
little hot L water Jus t ; before it Is placed
on'the b'aby's chest. Leave It on only
long enough! tq ; redden' the skin, which
wiir usually take about flve.or six mln
utes.v The 1 best, time to put on a plaster
of this^ kind , is ; just jbef ore the baby.' goes \
,to bed at night.*iUhder L no circumstances
should? he 1 . be "taken ". outÂ£directly. after a
-plaster has been -put on. '.
â¢The ;baby should ~not*be:given
syrups or. other medlcimtaf liable', to upset
hls?digestion ! .unlâ¬ssfthey are Vpeciaiyr
ordered a [doctor.
Croup *Is \u25a0 a':, thing dreaded \u25a0 by â¢ most
""mothers, It is .certainly
|.distresslng. r ;simpje^ spasmodic, croup', is
not 'of ten dangerous. 'It - usually ' makes
?JtÂ«7 appearance suddenly, and .often " : at
, night. TbÂ« baby"! may < have had a cold
or have bad some unusual exposure, or
there may :jnot have been any especial
causa that the mother can think of tat *
the sudden attack. .
The symptoms of croup are known tÂ»
almost every oneâ a dry, harking cough,
with more or less difficulty In breathing.
and a distressed look on the face of thÂ«
little sufferer seldom forgotten. If onoÂ«
seen. J^fiSÃs .' \u25a0
"Wring: out pieces of flannel In hot
water and put them on the cMldls throat
as hot as they can do borne, "changing
them from time to time as they grow
cold. ~ Make a tent over tne baby's crilÂ»
by means of an open umbrella, ovÂ«r
which . a : large sheet is spread; then
place a croup kettle or a tea kettle close,
to' the crib, , directing : the steam under
the sheet into the tent, so that the baby,
may inhale : It. but ' taking care . not to
turn him. This will usually afford morÂ«
relief than anything else that can bÂ«
done!" -If the attackis a severe one,' givÂ«
ten" drops of the l syrup of Ipecac every.
fifteen minutes until \u25a0 the child vomits,
and send " at once ] for a doctor. A tea
spobriful of castor oil \u25a0 should also bÂ«
given, or if the child has not recently
had a free movement from the bowels.
It will be wise to give an injection o*
soapsuds and warm water, for It* is im
portant to have the bowels open at such .
a time. . It is much wiser not to taka a
baby : but of doors the day after he has
had an" attack of croup.

ROMANTIC STORY
OF DARING CRIME
IS MADE PUBLIC
How Mysterious Lord Once Swindled Jay
Gould, and How the Financier. Got
Revenge at Last.
I ALE NOW I OLD FOR FIRST TIME
LONDON. Sept. i.-Chlef Justice Bain's
recent death In Manitoba recalls this
story to one who knew the facts at first
hand and Is now at liberty to recount
them for the first time. The lato Judge
'was merely a link in a chain of events
that had its beginning in a Princes
street Jewelry shop, Edinburgh, and
Â«nded at Winnipeg. The whole story is
burled In the archives of one of Scot
land's noblest houses, in the grave with
a Scotch Episcopalian clergyman, in
the vaults of an Edinburgh firm of so
licitors. In the private papers of the
late Chief Justice Bain, and in an un
marked mound on the banks of the Red
RlTer where the city of Winnipeg
cow stands.
What follows Is merely a sequel to an
Incident connected with the life of one
of the most mysterious criminals of
modern times, the man who outwitted
Jay Gould in the xenith of his financial
career out of millions, and caused the
relations between the governments of
the two great branches of the English
speaking race to become strained.
In the early seventies a slight, aris
tocratio-looklng young man stepped
from a carriage into the jewelry estab
lishment of .Marshall, the mo6t fashion
able jeweler of his day in Edinburgh.
There was evident taste In his selec
tions of various articles of Jewelry and
particular interest was shown by him
in a small silver casket of Venetian
workmanship. He instructed, that his
purchase be sent to a fashionable ho
tel with the bill. Whatever hesitation
Marshall or his people might have had
regarding the account was removed. by
the card banded by the.distinguished
looking purchaser, which read "Lord
Gordon Gordon" â the family name of
at least three of the noblest families In
Britain â and a reference to one of the
best known divines of the Scottish cap
ital. His appearance in the same shop
with this clergyman a few days after
ward completely allayed any doubts of
Marshall regarding payment for the ex
tensive purchase.
TRICK ON JAY GOULD.
The next the world knows of Lord
Gordon Gordon was his appearance in
London as a guest of a -well-known
corporation solicitor. From this
â¢Lrewd adviser of financial investment
the records show that Lord Gordon
Gordon borrowed more than. 310.000. ,
Shortly afterward he was heard of in
New York as a guest at the Astor
House, then the fashionable hotel of the
United States metropolis.
At this time the financial world was
agitated by the colossal schemes of Jay
Gould and Jim Fisk, among which the
wrecking of the Erie railway, then one
of the chief railways of the continent,
was a considerable factor.
There is a mystery surrounding the
origin of a report, which soon spread
through Wall street and into the count
ing houses of the wealthy and specula
tive that the good-looking young titled
Britisher, registered as Lord Gordon
Gordon at the Astor House, was the
representative of the British .bondhold
ers of the Erie Railway. These inter
ests *ere great and' were presumably
hostile to the Gould plans.
The story is told in the newspapers
of the time that Lord Gordon Gordon
was the only man of the day in the
financial world of the United States who
dared treat Jay Gould cavalierly. The
American millionaire, so runs the ac
count, was kept kicking his heels day
after day in the anteroom of Lord
Gordon's apartments while awaiting
an opportunity to confer with the sup
posed representative of the British in
terests in the Erie Railway. The first
interview resulted in the great Ameri
can capitalist being abruptly shown the
door by the apparently insulted young
aristocrat. The last resulted in the de
posit by Gould of negotiable securities
amounting- to seceral millions of dol
lars In the hands of Lord Gordon Gor
don as evidence of good faith on the
part of Gould in a transaction whereby
the British investors were to be out
witted through the breach of faith of
their supposed agent.:; .-.
The game was a gigantic one; for. a
boy only out of his teens was seeking
to outwit on their own ground the
shrewdest financiers of the American
continent. He succeeded after a cer
tain amount of vexatious litigation in
New York. He escaped successful
criminal prosecution through the du
bious character of the original trans
action and the alleged complicity of
Gould in his scheme against the British
investors.
FLIGHT TO THE WEST.
- - \u25a0
Lord Gordon Gordon waS next heard
of in St. Paul, Minnesota. It was the
time of the construction of the great
transcontinental railway, the North
ern Pacific, then being built on
tier great financial difficulties. The ar
rival of a millionaire and a British
Lord in one and the came person could
mean only one thingâ investment in
the wild prairie' lands of the embar
rassed railway. -He was treated" roy
ally by" the officials, excursions iWere
made to prospective townsites, a great
buffalo hunt was arranged, and on
many a site .of a now prosperous Min
nesota and Dakota town the historic
banner of the Grand Gordons of. Scot
land and the stars and stripes fluttered
before the marquee of a youth who
was befooling a continent to the full
est. \ ' , ;.
But the ' Implacable Jay Gould, still
had his emissaries on the trail of the
young adventurer and Gordon knew It.
In consequence, one day the people of
St. Paul learned that a buffalo hunt had
culminated in the arrival of Lord Gor
don' Gordon at Fort Garry, then form
ing the nucleus of the city of Winni
peg.
The life, of Lord Gordon Gordon Is i
well known to the Winnipeggers of th,e i
early, days. He occupied the home on '
the estate at Silver Heights owned 1 by!
the Governor F of the Hudson Bay Com- i
pany. who Is now" known .-as Lord I
Strathcona.' Canadian commissioner .- in '
London. Lord- Gordon Gordon's 'bospi-j
tali ty was a byword from Lake Superi-'
or to the" Rocky Mountains. Silver
Heights was the center of the social
Special Cable to The C*U.
life of the little settlement on the
banks of the Red River. What if thÂ«re
was a cloud over the past of a gentle
mannered host with fascinating: sifts
and of lavish generosity? The North
west Settlement, the newborn province
of Canada, took him as was the way of
the frontier for what he appeared to
be. The intimate friend of the'!
provincial Ministers of the crown,
of the judiciary, of the officers of the
military and of the better class of pro
fessional men, he was also the comrade
of the halfbreeds and Indians on many
a buffalo hunt or canoe trip into the
untraveled north.
Copies of Debret and Burke, the
chroniclers of the British peerage, were
not on' the book shelves of the then
Isolated settlement and It was easy to
convince the recipients of the generous
hospitality of an aristocratic-looking
young man of refined .and scholarly
tastes that he was a Scottish lord who
had escaped from the meshes of a net
set by an unscrupulous Wall street
operator. â¢
GOULD OX THE TRAIL.
While . Gordon was the guest of g*r
bernatorial dinners and . the host of
great hunting . parties. Jay Gould had
i not been idle. Several attempts had
been made on hunting trips to inveigle
the youth across -the border â¢to a spot
where he could be arrested on a crim
inal charge. The crime' of obtaining
money under false pretenses was not
extraditable under the Ashburton
treaty, and various were the .schemes
which Gould tirelessly set in motion to
bring Gordon within the clutches of
United States law.
Kidnaping was - attempted . twice and
once was almost j successful. In' the
dead of night the Chief of Police of St.
Paul with two. United -States con
stables handcuffed Gordon in his bed
at Silver Heights and on swift horses
bore him toward the United States bor
der. The body servant of Gordon, his
foster brother it -was said, a young
Highlander who. was believed to be the
sole repository of the secret of his mys
terious life, aroused the town of Win
nipeg, a few miles away. . An; armed
rescue party was at once . dispatched
In- pursuit. The Attorney, General
wired Pembina, the border town to
ward which the kidnapers had ridden,
and great was the Jubilation along. v the
Red River when th 6 "news came' that'
the. men of Pembina had forced the re
lease of Gordon from the quasi-official
kidnapers' at the point of the revolver..
â¢*\u25a0 The breakers^ of '- International law
were | taken prisoners and prosecuted
by Attorney General Clark and were
sentenced to terms of imprisonment.
Representations were submitted to the
British Government \u25a0 and a long afid
dangerous correspondence took place
between .London and Washington re
garding the matter.
NO LIGHT ON EARLY LIFE.
Foiled in this attempt, detectives
were sent to Great Britain by Gould to
ferret out the career of Gordon in Scot
land. That career, as far as they could
learn, began in the Princes street jew
elry shop of Marshall" in Edinburgh.
Beyond that, nothing could be discov
ered. , But pertinactiy, time and money
do much and j the agents persuaded
Marshall to take a trip to Toronto, and
there on , Canadian soil lay an infor
mation against one styling . himself
Lord Gordon' Gordon, charging him
with obtaining jewelry under false pre
tenses, specifically mentioning a Vene
tian casket of antique workmanship.
In the depths of = winter the. Journey
of the Canadian police office! s was
made and the arrest consummated one
night when a northern blizzard made
the trail between Silver Heights and
Winnipeg almost impassable. Gordon
had taken his arrest with the cool.in
souciance that was his . distinguished
characteristic He sent for his solici
tor, John F. Bain, the principal lawyer
of the province, who had been his per
sonal friend and professional adviser
throughout the many complications of
his short life in the Canadian. West. â¢
"This Is an action on the part of the
crown, on the part of _ the Canadian
Government, and I have" to inform
you," said Bain reluctantly, "that it
will be impossible for me . to act for
you. I have been the adviser of the
crown for several years in Winnipeg and
have been , specially Instructed in this
case on. its behalf." . \u25a0_.\u25a0\u25a0",-.
Gordon looked thoughtful for a min
ute and' the silence in the little house
grew oppressive. ,
"You can go thus far and retain your
standard of professional honor. Bain,*'
said Gordon quietly; 1 "you can tell me
if those legal papers carried by these
men are any good and if they, are suffi
cient to compel â¢me to appear in a To
ronto court."
"They are," answered the lawyer.
"Do you notice that they specifically,
describe" that Venetian casket in. which
is the love letter of Mary Queen -of
Scots to Adam Gordon? You'know sev
eral people have "seen it. That, will- be
sufficient to compel you to appear for
trial." '\u25a0\u25a0".- ;, . . .
.FALL OF THE CURTAIN.
"Strange fatality,", said. Gordon al
most dreamily, as he exchanged a look
with his servant; who: stood' in 'the door
; way of his adjoining; bedroom.'" "From
j Adam Gordon, the page of Mary's Court
in Holyrood three hundred â¢ years' ago,

i LONDIN. Sept 2.â Never within the
memory of some of the royal servants j
have Americans shown such an Inteerst
In the royal . palaces of England as they
have this summer. The average of nine
to ten parties which used to go through
Buckingham Palace and Marlborough
House a few seasons ago has increased
this year to forty or thereabouts, with
the result that an extra staff of attend
ants and guides; had to be 'employed.
Marlborough House appears to have had'
greater attraction for visitors than even
Buckingham Palace, especially with wom
en, who all i want ; to j see the children of
the Prince and Princess of Wales.-,
What surprised . the household ser
vants most was that nearly every party
came around with an official, document
authorizing admission. In every in
stance these were signed by the Lord
Chamberlain or by Sir Dighton Probyn;
the keeper ;of the -Prince of- Wales',
privy purse. , There were so many
Americans, disappointed last year that
at the beginning of the present season
both the King and tue Prince of -Wales
gave instructions that no unnecessary
obstacles should be â¢ placed in the way
of .Americans desiring to see the pal
aces, but it may be of interest to those
who .succeeded in obtaining ready per
mission to ; know 'that an extra staff
of special*: detectives kept them -under^
observation /the": whdle of "^the* "tlme?*
This precaution was ; taken "In- conse-^
quene'e-of the presence of three or four
men fromV:' Chicago: who were doing
London, j and â¢ who were suspected '", of
revolutionary leanings. These. "men
could not be allowed inside the gates of
the palaoes . under.' any - circumstances;
even if they, had succeeded in obtaining
permits signed- by King Edward him
self.
. Among the many applicants for. ad
mission to. Marlborough House, none
showed greater, disappointment than
1 the three women from Washington who
gave their names as Miss Ida Ingersoll,
Mrs. Dereham Holtsinger and . Mrs.
Madeline Kjirtz. ; They were provided
with a fully" authenticated permit, but
they reached Marlborough j House -at
8:30 in the morning.* On being told that
their pass distinctly stated that the
palace was open to visitors only /be
tween 3 and 6 in the afternoon, they
implored the official in charge. to let
them see the children of the Prince and
Princess, declaring they had come all
the way from the United* States with
that special object. They were told. it
was , contrary . to etiquette to : allow
strangers v to see the children In the ab-'
sence of the Prince and ' Princess \u25a0 ; or
without^ their authority. They could
not wait for that as they had to leave
for Southampton to catch their steamer
in a few hours. -
Society "people are wondering why

place at â¢ Richmond. Like her â¢ mother,
Queen Alexandra, the Duchess is dis

ready credence, to ghost stories. One
of her maids complained some : time

ney in her bedroom which caused her
many sleepless : nights. The maid,
after repeated complaints, was removed
to another r00m, % but ' the mysterious
noises still pursued her. The Bervlces

requisitioned to discover if rats or mice
were infesting the place. ; After minute

FOLK
Wild horses could not have dragged
it from me. but May Irwin is different
She had asked me: "Won't you take
the big chair V .
"Won't your* I asked back.
"Now, that's unkind!" she re.proaob.ed
me. But ehe grave a May Irwin giggle
as Ehe put me gently but flriniy into
the big chair, and then squeezed herself
into the little one beside it, with: "No,
ma'am, I alt on this chair onlyâ you
don't have to say anything- about it,
but It's the only one where my feet
touch the floor!"
Thea lilts Irwin drew up a cozy inch
nearer to me, her face beaming like a
Email, family sun. Behind her blos
somed a forest of roses, lilies and car
nations, trophies of the night before,
fresh and pink and white as the lady
herself. Her hair was touched into
genial sold by the morning sun, ,aud
Miss Irwin looked as delectable and at
tractive as one of her own recipes.
There was that, too. I had seen the J
cook book, the May Irwin cook book,
every recipe good as Government bonds, j
And had I not seen May Irwin the night
before? So when she tucked â¢ her
thumbs Into her belt, smiled that largo,
irresistible smile of hers, asked me, in j
that honeyed. Southern mammy voiceâ j
Just as if it were of all things what she j
moet wanted to know: "How d'ye?" I j
told her. Weakly, inexcusably, I told j
her.
I told Mles Irwin that I didn't "do"
at all, that there wasn't another per
son I would have come out to see that
morning but her. that I had if not
spring- measles everything else and â
"Hml" eaid Miss Irwin, "hm!" She
ran a quick eye over me, hummed
again, nodded like a wise old M. D. and
asked: "What have you been eating?"
â¢ It was of no use to say "nothing."
Mies Irwin "knew better." "Don't you
know, child, that half of all the sick- j
ness comes through eating? â so does j
the other half! Let â me â see." Ana j
then she prescribed for me, with the :
radiant good sense and brimming sym
pathy that is the very marrow of her
work. Croup or chowder, you could !
bee it was all the same to Miss Irwin.
She is the kind of person every one
poes to with their troubles. You can't
help itâ it is her own fault. I said I felt !
better for the prescription. I did â for
the prescriber. for the big, warm,
Iriendliness thaft went to the prescrib
ing.
Inevitably then we talked about the i
cook book. Miss Irwin may be proud of |
being the funniest woman in the coun- j
try. Neither does ehe forget that she j
sunned It with Augustin Daly for four]
years. Nor does Miss Irwin object to re- !
membering that she held Ban Francisco]
laughing for fifteen years, three times a |
year, some hm!â years ago. But all these i
prides are as naught when it comes to j
the cook book. Word has Just borne in |
that the bookstores had ordered 600 new i
copies. Miss Irwin preened herself at the
word and asked me if I had tried all of
the recipes.
I told her my family and myself were
eating through the book as fast as we
could.
"You'll never regret it," Miss Irwin
cubscribed. Then with the author pride ;
full upon her she related: "Funny how <
it happened. I wrote it when I was ill [
during the two years I retired, you know ;
â had to do something. And first one !
woman friend would bring in her daintiest ;
dish and then another â comical! I often â¢
thought what a good scene It would make
in a play; one with Aunt Julia's corn :
coup, another with mamma's fritters â not |
all good, oh, no! But In the bookâ l tett j
you, all tried, my dear, all tried!" â¢
."Miss Irwin," I ventured, "you are a
blooming testimonial" â
"Get away there," she laughed, . over
her several plumpnesses, "but I am â eh! |
Don't forget" â she added, "to try Sarah's t
dishes."
"Sarah V
. "She's my maid," Miss Irwin informed

, me. "Wish Sarah was here; like you to
' meet her. Had her for se-wenteen years,
don't you know. But her Southern dishes!
There you're talking." â¢
"You saidâ maid?" I queried.
"Oh!" laughed Miss Irwin, "cook. I
meant. Sarah's my cook. -What would I
do with a maid? Do I look like a woman
with a maid? Couldn't be bothered. No,
Sarah is the Sarah of the cook book, and
a cook, if I know one. She wasn't very
well, so I brought her out with me."
Other claims to distinction has Sarah,
It seems that race . suicide Is discounte
nanced upon Miss Irwin's island â she
owns one of the "Thousand Islands" and
she lives thereâ and Sarah has contribut
ed four small darkies to the population,
all during her period of service in Misa
Irwin's household. \u0084
"I've been thinking," I broke in here,
"that I would give a good deal to see May
Irwin as Mrs. Major O'Dowdâ in 'Vanity
Fair.' "
"Tell you what," said Miss Irwin.
"I don't knfiw anything I'd like to do
better. Never so disappointed in my
life as when Lorlmer Btoddard left
Mrs, O'Dowd out of his "Becky Sharp.'
Tell you another thing I would like
to have done. Sister Sowlsby In 'The
Damnation of Theron Ware.' Harold
Frederic and Clyde Fitch were fixing
that up when Frederic died."
"Tell me," I asked confidentially, "did
you ever break into Shakespeare when
you -were with Daly7"
"That was another disappointment,
me child." she said; "no, I did not. But
I came within a mile or two of it once.
It was when they put on The Merry
Wives of Windsor.' Here, May, Is your
chance, I thought, and I waited for
Mr. Daly to come and tell me that it
was up to me to do Mrs. Ford. I wait
ed. Daly forgot. Heâ gaveâ -it â toâ,
some â one else. But,"' here Miss Ir
win's smile widened and her big blue
eyes clostd in the little crescents of
fun that is all you usually get of
them, "I went to him â didn't know
enough to be afraid. All the rest
trembled with fear at his frown! 'Mr.
Daly,' said I, 'why didn't you give me
the part of Mrs. Ford?' He looked at
me, seemed to me for two minutes,
then he said, 'May, you're much too
modern for old comedy.' That was as
near as I ever got to Shakespeare."
That the four, years with Daly were
the happiest of her life she said then,
and then fell to talk of the vaude
ville. In which she won her name and
fame. ' . %
"Greatest school In the world," Miss
Irwin decided, "at least then. I sup
pose I'll be Jumped on for . being an
old-timer If I say it isn't the same now.
But it is not It is like the legitimate
stage, overcrowded with people who
know nothing of their business. They
say, 'Well, I'm not going to-work; I'll
go on the stage!' It really was differ
ent in the old days. You see "now
plenty of good sensations, acrobats and
so on, but the really funny -song and'
dance 'artist' you get only very rarely."
"Didn't I know it!" I said;. , \ _
, "You see,*" Miss Irwin elaborated, "in
the old variety days it was variety;
not vaudeville thenâ there were no peo
ple writing sketches for you or. even
songs. You wrote them yourself â
that meant a certain amount of brains.
And you'd play a place for six weeks
and change your act every week, I tell
you! Nor did we get the salaries
thenâ"
"What did you get then?" I inter
rupted.
The queen of modern farce laughed
and added this to my dramatic sta
tistics: "When my sister and I started
we got J3fc> a weekâ between us!"
"And found?"* I asked.
"No, ma'am," she said. "Last year per
haps you will remember that Cissie Lof
tus got $2000 a week." '\u25a0
"And Lillian Russell anything from
$1000 to 53000 this," I added.
"Oh, but when sister and I got $100 a
TOE SAl^ FRANOSC^
week!" Miss Irwin exclaimed, *Tve never
been so rich since!. Couldn't, breathe
when they told me." .'
"You did your own sketches' those
days," I said, "tell me now," how much
of 'Mrs. Black Is Back' is yours."
Misa Irwin became all seriousness at
this. "Now," she said," "I always feel
badly about that Really, I have, hardly
added a line to the , part ; it is all Mr.
Hobarfs work. It fits me so : well - that
every one gives me the ' oredlt for ; the
thing. I have hardly done anything/ at
all to it. Mr. Hobart Is a very clever
fellow and I'd like him to get anything'
that's coming." '
Then came word that Miss Irwin'o sons
were hungry, that Miss Irwin's sons were
going to luncheon.; S
"Don't know how I'm going to get them
away from here," she said. "They Just
love it, like their, mother. Walter says
'a tent 'ln any part of the: State for me.'
It's the first time they; have traveled with
meâ never knew before how mother.work
ed," she chuckled. : v
"How many?" I; asked. /
"Two,'! said Miss. lrwin. ,
"Any girls?" ' V
"Thank God. no," was the unexpected
rejoinder.
"Why?"
"Wouldn't have girls to have to work ,
as I've had to work for anything," Miss
Irwin declared." "Then there are all | the
temptations to go wrong, the inclina
tionsâ" "
"For the stage, you mean?".
3 "No, ma'am, I don't." said the actress.
"There is less opportunity to go -wrong
en the stage. than almost anywhere else.
You can't afford to. Yon- â "
But the Irwin boys .were hungry and
the Irwin boys wanted mamma. But it
was of the simple life ; of the; actress as
agralnst the strenuous lire, of j the ; average
society woman that the funniest: woman
In America was talking as I left -

not far to seek. That novel Is fairly

on the .stage .is likely to profit the

Shaw received from the Shuberts
$5000 as advance royalty on "Captain,

Intend for the use of Ada Rehan. The"

CULTURE PANIC AMONG DEBUTANTES
J?uch a culture panic among the
looked-for debutant's!
Like a covey of quail, they? dart* in
, and out of the seclusion of th^ school
room, announcing their candidacy for
social honors cw day. an-1 then, lo! â
they ar*> gone again â back to school. i
Well, the first they gÂ»vÂ» is. "They're !
too young- to corn* out"; the second, j
"They do r.ot know enough"; the third j
isn't usually expressed aloud, but it's I
this â lend me your ears â there are old- ',
er sisters. And there's nothing so jar- j
ring upon a family and its friends as a I
bunch of girls in society at the same j
time. Hence, the propriety of holding !
â¢the baby." back until tornethingr matri
monial happens and relieves the situa
tion.
As to thp first reasen. that of youth, j
it would seem that they are v.-ise little !
maidens, for there is no game in a
woman's life harder to play than that
of debutante, with its physical; mental j
and spiritual strain.
As to the second reason â they're not
knowing enoughâ that epe-ns up a big |
question. What is it they s?ek to know? (
What is :t they take up in that year |
or two given up to study after the 1
usual seminary course? Is it a kaowl- I
*Cge of things feminine, of the things j
that God intended should be woman's
work â learning of children, of home- I
ke<ep:::g\ of understanding the great j
laws of nature, violations of which
bring nine-tenths of the griefs upon the !
world?
Hardly. You will find upon investi
gation that the lime is given to the
higher branches of mathematics, to
analytical language work, to music,
perhaps to social subjects, but not to
the things for which they were created
and which ultima-ttiy they must under
take: â the duties of wifefcood and moth
erhood.
But here's another phase of the ques^
tion: While the girls are acquiring this
higher knowledge of things they don't
need to know, hosts of young men, in a
hurry to get a foothold to tne business
world, leave school or college early.
This gives the preponderance of educa
tion to the wGmen. Is this a wise pro
vision, particularly where the lines of
education lie along the seii-same groove*
If the educational work lay along
differentiating lines, each according to
the necessities of sex, then would con
trasts be less sharply drawn, and the
danger of invidious comparison be less
Imminent.
However, if the dear little girls will
go back to school to take up calculus
and other mental gymnastics, here's to
them! â and they come back next year
to add to the joy of ISOS.
On the 4th, all who are "in" society,
and all who are not, but who have the
price â and the good sense to part with
it for Â£n equivalent in fun â will Jind
themselves upon the golf-links at Del
Monte, where the annual tournament
will be held, closing with a brilliant
tr.<tle on the 10th.
Incidentally, there will be a lot of
social byplay attending the affair, teas
at the clubhouse, dinners and, I believe,
a. smart dance, besides the best swim
ming of the whole year.
At no time of year ia Del Monte so
allarinjj as now, and the golf-links are
a. luxury to gaze upon, so velvety and
treen.
- And r.ot only is Del Monte to be gay,
but the Presidio Is preparing to do its
share of entertaining. Home charming
fellows at the post â but the handsomest
are marriedâ alas: But they're charm
ing, nevertheless.
A ball at Eurlingame for Alice Roose
velt :
That's the most dazzling affair on the

secret.
The Burlingame folk are hoping
against hope to *have their new club
house finished, that they may entertain
the President's daughter therein.
The trades unions keeping good they
ought to have it in shape, which would
greatly add to importance of the affair.

GENTLEMAN BURGLAR TO SERVE
ONE YEAR IX SAN QUENTIN
Juris* Cook Advises James 13. Fltzpst
rlck .\ot to Carry Skeleton
Keys In Pockets.
James E. Fitzpatrick, clubman, miner,
butcher and burglar, convicted by a
Jury In Judge Cook's court, was sen
tenced yesterday to serve one year In
Pan Quentin. His attorney had made a
motion for a new trial, which the Judge
denied.
In passing sentence the Judge re
ferred to the defendant's social position
and said that it was a very bad piece
of business for a man of his education
end intelligence to carry skeleton keys
in his pockets. He would make the
sentence as light as possible and after
serving it if he showed signs of refor
mation the Governor of the State had
the privilege of restoring him to citi
zfnship. Technically It was petty lar
ceny, but as the defendant had more
opportunities to be honest than most
men mho appeared before him he could
not give him the benefit of a techni
cality.
Fitzpatrick robbed the telephone box
in the office of Herman Albert, coal
dealer, 1765 Waller Â» street, about a
year ago. Another charge of burglary .
against him for breaking into the office

Ivlngton, yesterday succeeded in levy
ing an attachment for $200 on the auto
mobile supposed to be owned by J.
Campbell Shorb and the machine ie now
being held at the Sheriff's warehouse.
Ho&g claims that the amount is due
him as a final payment for the pur
chase of the Palace Hotel Laundry
route. The attorneys had difficulty in
reaching any of Shorb's property and
after levying on the automobile a man
named Lane came forward and claimed
that he owned the machine, having lent
it for a time to Shorb. This claim is
questioned by Hoag and his attorney.

Nordberg did not uccept the offer, as
he. did not think \t was, right. \u25a0 . Besides
thai, he' had 110 money with which to
pay Grafter Johnson for -his unlawful
services. Nordberg went to Australia

him that he had come from New York
in 1897." He told the "offlciar also that
Johnson had told him what to say to
the Judge in order to get tlie: papers.
Johnson, Nordberg and the Government
official then went to the United States
Circuit Court, where, in accordance
with the instructions.; given him by
Johnson, Nordberg told Judge.Morrow

PUBLICATION OFFICE THIRD AKD MARKET STREETS. SAN FRANCISCO
SUNDAY .. .SEPTEMBER 3. 1905;
AN ORGAN AND THE* GRAND JURY. '
ONE of the organs of the municipal administration is exceeding
wroth and much displeased at what The Call has said about
the report of the Grand Jury arraigning the ''administration
upon specific charges. In order to have no misunderstanding, we
desire to say that The Call did not intend to please the organ. This
removes the suspicion that we did but shot wide.of the mark.
The Call's purpose is to aid in cleansing the- government of
the city. We desire to promote all movements made with that' end;
in view. To give this city a decent government has become a neces
sity of such magnitude that it justifies obliteration of party 'lines;
and even the sinking of personal preferences, that the citizens may
get together, use the power that is in their ballots and redeem San-
Francisco from a condition probably the most deplorable into which
the city has ever fallen. To do this men must take up amis against
all the resources of craft, cunning and . corruption. It is pitiful
to see .1 city like this lying like a carcass, preyed upon by political
buzzards. We desire to terminate this situation) and we believe
that the Republican League, the public-spirited Democrats and the
allied decency of the city were materially aided by the exhaustive
and truthful report of the Grand Jury.'
The organ which bewails our approval of the report does, not
take the trouble to impeach any statement made in the report, but
contents itself with taking pot shots at the members of the jury.
The representative citizens who composed that body will not suffer
in mind, body, estate or reputation by such attacks. The^va
lidity of their action is verified indeed by the circumstances under
which the accusing organ has become an organ of the .municipal ad
ministration. Its conversion to that use is so recent and its change
so acute as to make it obviously a part of the system- of -graft and
greed which the Grand Jury exposed and the Republican League
and the people desire to destroy.
A year ago this same organ was foremost among the ..accusers
of the same administration which it now supports, and in behalf
of which it grinds daily a tune of detraction of all men and all
bodies of men who believe that what it said a year ago was true.
Then this same organ" said, editorially: "While graft reigns su
preme in San Francisco, while the lid of the tenderloin has been
lifted, and while crimes are being daily winked at by the authori
ties, it is comforting to know that the city has Supervisors who
are determined to make the fight for right and who will not allow
the scandals o*f the municipality to go unexposed. The Board of
Health, which is simply part of the Schmitz-Ruef machine, Has an
unsavory reputation among the respectable citizens of ;San Fran
cisco. In all its ramifications it is a conspicuous example of the
graft that is dominating and disgracing the city of San Francisco."
The same article proceeds then to indorse thie resolution in
troduced by Dr. D'Ancona, in the Board of Supervisors, ordering
the Auditor not to pay the salaries "of the numerous positions that
have been created to give the Ruef henchmen jobs, in violation of
the budget and of the civil service rules." The organ warned the
Auditor not to pay "the salaries of the Schmitz-Ruef grafters," and
threatened him with action in the courts if he did. It expressed
the hope "that he will be found on the side of good government, on
the side of economy^ on the side that is opposed to graft." It de
clared that: "If the taxpayers are capable of the emotion of grati
tude, the}* certainly should show their gratitude, first of all to Dr.
D'Aiicona, who framed the report for the Finance Committee."
Concluding, the organ, in this editorial that is scarcely a year
old, said: "This is the 'first good, strong fight that has been made
against the graft of the present administration. That -the action of
the Supervisors should be enthusiastically indorsed /goes without
saying. All public officials who set their faces against graft and
against violations of the law should receive hearty indorsement
from voters and taxpayers, who are being daily robbed in order to
support a political machine which is covering the city with dis
grace. There is no just cause nor. impediment why the Supervisors
should not investigate the status of other boards, should not find
some excuse to probe into the grafting scandals of the tenderloin,
and should not relieve the city of San Francisco from the burdens
that become intolerable when the grafters are gathered together
in the midst of the community. NO HELP CAN BE EXPECTED
FROM THE GRAND JURY ; it is therefore in order for the Su
pervisors to twist every point so that relief can be obtained. Dr.
D'Ancona has done his work well. Now let some other Supervisors
arise and smite the enemy, the worst enemy of the municipality â
GRAFT."
Well, another Grand Jury, replacing the one of which the organ
despaired a year ago, arose and smote the enemy. It sent three
grafting ballot-box stuff ers to the penitentiary, and in its report it
uncovered and disclosed the graft and the violations of law of which
the organ complained a year ago. Then the organ, with its crank
in the same hands that ground out the tune of 1904, proceeds to
smite the new Grand Jtrry for doing what it said ought to be done.
Who put the new cylinder in the organ and what did it cost?
Who filled its barrel with the new tune in praise of the same ad
ministration which a year ago it denounced for disgracing San
Francisco?
If the people needed anything to stir them to action it is the
contrast -between the present organ of the administration and what
it was a year ago. We submit the foregoing! as a bill of particulars
to show why we did not commend the Grand Jury for the purpose
of pleasing the organ. ... ,"':..! -'."'"' .-..',.'"
MORE EQUALITY.
'THE progress toward perfect equality for women is more rapid
I than appears on the surface. The ladies, bless 'em, are no
*\u25a0 longer standing back in anything. They are. in alL lines of
industry, competing with the tyrant man, and the university pro
fessors and sociologists are beginning to take notice, " and butchers
and bakers and candlestick makers are on the run. â¢
Man has no sure grip on the monopoly of anything any more.
He dare not let go to spit on his hands, lest his place be taken by
sister woman and he lose his job. Heretofore the ; trousered.tyrant
has had burglary, and Mage robbing to himself, but now he is iin
danger of losing both. It is announced from Oakland that a "lady"
burglar is operating in that town. The evidence is mainly infer
ential, that is to say, circumstantial, developed by the. methods: of
Sherlock Holmes.' Houses are burglarized, and ;the charming Easter
hats of ladies are taken away, with other articles of; finery, :us*e and
adornment, dear only to the sex. : Men's heavy if; useful:and:unsen
timental watches are left, and tiny tickers, beautiful 'but poor time
keepers, belonging to ladies, are carried' off by-the peck. Ribbons
and laces, furs and furbelows, fripperies and phylacteries. of all sorts
nre^-anishing under the skillful touch of this female ,but bold burglar.
It remains now for the local Hawk'shaws to construct- the per
sonality of this interesting moonlight mechanic. Obviously inlobt
ing hats' and wearing apparel she is goveiÂ»nedj by her own style,.com
plexion and the color of her hair. If she run\to certain: colors shei is
a brunette, if to certain others she is a; blonde. Her* waist measure
may be taken. by the jeweled belts she appropriates, and even f the
style of hats she prefers may reveal features; ami coiffure. Trie de
tectives should get busy, though it is our opinion that invasion of
the burgling industry by her calls for female â¢ detectives." "Goarse
and non-sensitive man â¢ cannot begin to.' reason but, f mm her acts^ her
style and form and features, as a woman can. .- So sue has probably':
created a new industry.:' for; lief
watch with interest her. further:; operations '\u25a0'\u25a0. and the? pursuit, /fwhich
may end in her identification and capture, if the principles we suggest
are applied, to the" chase. - :

HUMANITY'S
HUNGERS
Professor Earl Barnes lectured to the
Kensington school teachers on "Human
HiiniSrs" "at -the'Froebel Institute re
cently;* says the London Express:
He gave the following list of "human
hungers" and the ages at which they can
first be "noticed:
Hunger for food and drink-Infancy.
-Hunger for actionâ Infancy. ::â¢.: :â¢.
Hunger for knowledgeâ lnfancy.
Hunger for companionshipâ Six .weeks.
' Hunger for>ropertyâ Two. years. _
* Hunger for self-aggrandizementâ Five
years. " ...
Hunger for beautyâ Two years.
Hunger for reasoningâ Seven years.
, Hunger for worshipâ Thirteen years.
Hunger for ; righteousness â Fifteen
years. i^SRSHP * \u25a0\u25a0_ ,
The natural. desire for food and drina
13 strongest, said the' prqfessor, at blrln.
After twenty* the appetite" should, if not
misused, 'become less and less, till at
seventy -a. man "or woman ought only to
require one: small /.meal, a day.'*;
J . The - "hunger". . for property. Is ver y
strong at . about fifteenâ the "collecting ,
age. when boys will amass anything
from stamps to beetles. When all other
"hungers" fail, the "property hunger
still exists, and a man is most likely to be
a miser when he is nearest his grave.
The "hunger" for beautyâ that is, the
real "beauty hunger," which means the
admiration of -art for ait's sakeâ is. the
most uncommon of all.
No child can be said to have the
"reason hunger" till he or she ask 3 how
It Is that Santa Claus manages to get
down a narrow chimney with a bag of
toys. Then "reason" is beginning 'to
dawn. This is quite different from tha
"hunger" for knowledge, which 13 mera
curiosity.
"Hungers" must be kept as necessities,
or they will become vices. The "action
hunger" is > liable to develop into globe
trotting, the "property hunger" ' into
meanness, and the "food and drink" hun
ger into gluttony and drunkenness.
On the other hand, "hungers" must b*
developed sufficiently. If, for example,
self-aggrandizement Is not advanced
enough, it becomes apathy. In short, wa
must keep our "hungers" at the happy
medium.
BEARS MILKED COW
Who milked the cow every evening on
Its return from pasture has been puzzling
the brain of Augustus Damm for a week:
past, says the Port Jervis correspondent
of the New York World. Damm is a
farmer on the Greenville turnpike, ft va
miles east of here. The mystery was
solved last evening by Damm. who
watched his cows an hour before milk-
Ing time. Two bear cubs emerged from
the brush near the pasture, and, each
selecting a teat of the cow, began pulling.
The farmer ran out and captured both
cubs. The cubs squealed so that Damm
looked about for their mother, but the
animals appeared to be alone, and the
young bears are now locked up in his
barn. ,

To defend certain conclusions -which he
arrived at resultant of his being an act
ive member of the Society of Psychical
Research, Professor James H. : Hyslop.
formerly of the chairs of ethics 'and -logic
In Columbia UnSversHr. wrote his book
called "Self nee and a Future Life." Be
sides his individual experimental work he |
uses for bases of his argument the Inves
tigations of the gTeat scientist. Sir Oliver
Lodge, those, of Professor Henry Sedge
is :ck of Cambridge, Professor James of
Harvard, Frederick Myers, late president
of the English Society of Psychical Re
search, and Dr. Richard Hodgson, secre
tary of the American branch of the so
ciety. He "has summarized the principal
part of the society's work which bears
relation to the problem of a future. life.
The eighteen volumes In which the re
ports of the society are embodied are
most too much matter for people of the
busy world to plow through, and so this'
rcedlum-*ized book of 269 pages will be
very welcome to those who axe Interested
in the subject; and who Is not? Not to
be interested in what some of the finest
minds of our generation have done in
this psychical society to throw light on
the probability of the survival of human
personality after death would surely
mean never to have loved a relative or a
friend dearly enough to wish to believe
the life of such loving will endure for
ever, and pursuantly to seek as 9weeter
than any treasure trove all evidences
that make such believing sensibly ten
able. â¢;;â¢\u25a0>
In a summing up chapter, called "Eth
ical Meaning and Results," the author
gives a long Quotation from Professor
ilyers, late president of the English So
ciety for Psychical Research, the last sen
tence of which is this:- "It may be that
for some generations to come the truest
faith will He in the patient attempt to
unravel from confused phenomena some
trace of the surxrna. worldâ to find thus
at last the substance of things hoped for,
the evidence of things unseen." Were it
not by virtue of the consideration of the
thought embodied in that quotation there
Is a certain class of readers who might
think the fallowing of the investigations
with any serious intent would be idle or
at least superfluous; namely, that class
who base their faith on grounds for other
than the kind of investigations called sci
entific. There are tens of thousands now 1 *
aJive who, like Peter of old, in their ptr
sonal faith can repeat after him, "Mas
ter, to whom shall we go? Thou hast the
words of, eternal life." and who believe
that blessed was Simon Barjona in that
the truth of eternal life was not revealed
to him through scientific investigationâ
eighteen volumes long strung out. and
utterly inadequate to compel conviction
when all the tedious tale is told. There
are reasons, though, as these words of
President Myers Indicate, why minds as
widely apart as those of mystics of firm
est faith and materialists of profoundest
doubt may be glad that men trained to
scientific investigation' are so earnestly
trying to find evidences of immortality.
Professor Hyslop puts It this way: "If
the ideal is worth tolerating in philo
sophic reflection at all the possibility
of proving- It by facts ought to be re
spected when any phenomena offer the
opportunity or the hope of it, and the
ag^ which has exhausted Its resources
to study the origin of man jnight find
it quite as respectable to examine into
his destiny.**
Professor Hyslop says in his preface
that his work Â« is â¢ intended for the
reader who Is more interested In expla
nation than In wearisome details; and
it may be quite interesting: to those
who have not even time to read such
brief summary as his book to know
that this master of both ethics and
logic found enough from his investi
gations into psychic phenomena, most
guardedly scrutinized and analyzed, to
give him a strong trust In that future
life of which he writes. This convic
tion is a great importance to him just
as a matter of scholastic interest, for
he thinks that the question of the sur
vival of personality is not an isolated
problem without philosophic associa
tions or meaning, "but is most funda
mental to the Integrity and utility of
ail philosophies." This book, though,
published Prst, is part of a sequel to a
work on the "Problems of Philosophy,"
â¢which is now being: prepared for pub
lication. The part of psychic phenom
ena which proved most convincing to
him was that manifested through me
diumlstic control. He not only studied
the investigations of the other scientific
men. but also put it to the test of per
sonal communications with his dead
relatives. He believes in telepathy, but
does not think that the spiritistic is
the right explanation of the phenomena
\u25a0which gx> by that name. He sums up
his results on that subject thus: "I,
therefore, hold to telepathy as a suit
able explanation, if such we may call
It. of phenomena that cannot lay claim
to any transcendental origin of a spir
itual kind ' and that represent a su
pernormal relation between living
minds. That is as far as I can go.
and I shall revise that opinion when it
can be shown to be unscientific" * His
summing up of the subject of ap
paritions, of which he gives many most
remarkable and well authenticated ex
amples, is given in the words of a
committee of the society: "Between
deaths and. apparitions of the dying
person a connection exists which Is not
due to chance. This we hold as a
proved fact." The net result of the me
diumistic evidence of dlscarnate' spir
its is this: The majority of the sit
ters had sufficient success to be im
pressed with the Indubitable evidence
of something supernormal,' and many of
them felt convinced that they were In
reality communicating with, their de
parted friends."
There are many, remarkable details
of psychic phenomena given .in; ' the
book, but as some of these and numbers
of similar ones can be found published
elsewhere, the main interest '. in .'the
present, work is. In' the; personal' con
clusions from them revealed 'by such
a student as Professor He
did not find the evidences so overwhelm-"
dng as to make conviction .of . there
being a future life on their grounds
complete, but they very strongly in
creased his trust In that hoped-for sur
vival of death. The author writes In'
a way to make his appeal to material
ists and, to those who refuse to be
lieve witttout evidence. That
he attaches great importance to the
necessity of convincing all men* of -the
evidences' for a future life {is shown, by
the earnestness of his arguments
throughout. In' hie chapter on -ethical
meanings and results he says this: "I
do not think ; 'social science' can supply
the lack of religion- No science can
oroduce the motives that regulate hu
man action. It can only reinforce 'or
justify them by establishing the
truths on which those motives feed.
The great forces .' of civilization are
certain ineradicable Instincts, and the
desire" for survival is one of them in
the properly ; social and moral man-
It is not noticeable in the man who
has no real social impulses of the high
moral order. Vlt is: the 'religion - of
â¢orrow,* tbe' passionate pity for pain
where It seems undeserved," the altru
istic sympathy for the weak and help
less, that feels most; the need of a con
tinued existence after'death to balance
the . lnecualities of the present, though
6uch natures do not themselves feel the
personal need of it. But no science
will create this .demand for It* as -the
condition for considering the world
morally rational." It will be felt,
however, by some readers that neither
the longing of the unfortunate and the
weak for compensation, nor the sym
pathy of the strong for -,the
weak, need make the "whole or the su
preme desire for a, future life.' The
strongest, the most vital, the most for
tunate, the best endowed, of all' human
creatures would surely passionately
desire survival in order that those
things which they recognized as life's
essence might. continue to be possessed
by them and that they- might know
better than "as in a glass darkly" the
donor to whom they should give grati
tude.

ROBERT CHAMBER*' STORY
OF EIGHT PRETTY^GIRLS
I Very sprightly, \u25a0 indeed, is "Iole," the'
; gay story by Robert W. Chambers about !
eight pretty girls â¢ raised up in \u25a0 Spartan j
simplicity by their pdet father, who was:
i very poor, but exceeding . politic in dis- ,
posing of the said daughters by a' process i
of elimination. Idle: was the nrat to go. j
Wayne got her. He was â¢ a capitalist.,
She was a prize. It is an Idyl the way
he. wooed, and won her 'in a- week.' She !
cultivated vegetables, picked daisies,!
and wore pajamas during the day, and in j
the night she slept on a mat in a bunga- i
low and wore no clothes nor cover. So |
she grew up of wonderful hardiness and
simplicity 'and exceeding grace -of limb. |
When they took her and her! sisters to i
the city and taught thÂ«n to wear stock- [
ings, and fluffy things, and laced things, j
these sweet country girls, who had been \
brought up far from the madding'
crowd and according to a poet's ideal
of feminine education In' innocence of the |
wicked world, -naively told the city young!
men what they were wearing under their
lovely gowns and explained \u25a0 what a queer, !
uncomfortable novelty the \ experience
was. When lole got married- and .went
on a yacht for a honeymoon trip, â¢:â¢ her j
younger ideally, upbrought sisters, aged
seventeen to thirteen, wondered if the
bride would bring a baby back with her,
and how long It usually took to find the
cunning little things, and, if the seeking
of them was like the game of hunt the j
thimble "and lots and lots of fun." It is
all very funny as told by Mr. Chambers
in his own Inimitable way.
When Wayne met lole at her father's
| poverty stricken country home he found
I her so superior to himself In education,
; in culture. In fine Instinct, In moral de
velopment, he felt himself outclassed and
told her so. She says: "Listen. Itâ it
distresses mo to think I hold you â lightly.
Truly we are not apart." Said he. "There
is but one thing that can Join us."
\u25a0 Her pQre gaze did not falter nor -her
eyes droop. Curiously regarding him.
the seemed immersed in the ' problem as
he had solved it. "Do you wish me to
love you?" she asked. Then follow sev
eral passionate protestations and . some
more eager queries and prompt and lover
: like replies. Finally the unsophisticated
maiden asks, "How do you wish me to
love "you?" ' He opened Ms arms. She
stepped forward dose to him. Then their
lips met. "Oh," she said faintly, "I did
not know it was so sweet." As her. head
fell back on his arm about her neck she
looked up at him full, of wonder at this
new knowledge he had taught her, mar
velous, unsuspected, divine in its sim
plicity.'*
In the midst of his other cleverness the
author makes a playful fling at George
Bernard Shaw's literary and dramatic
eccentricities. The occasion is when one
of those sweet and simple minded sisters
ol lole was at the theater. "There was
a young wife behind the rootllghts ex
plaining to a young man, who was not
her husband that her marriage vows need
not be too seriously considered if he,
the young man/ found them too incon
venient. scared the young man,
who was plainly a purveyor of heated
air and a short sport." 1 ,
"Is that life?" whispered lole's sister,
to her escort, her sensitive mouth
aqulver. "Did the author actually know
such people? Do you? Is conscience
really only an attitude? Is instinct the
only guide? Am Iâ reallyâ oadâ "
"No," whispered Lethbrldge: "all that
Is only a dramatist's attitude. Don'tâ
don't look grieved! Why, every now and
then a man discovers that he can attract
more attention by standing- on his head.
That is allâ really, that is all. Barnard
Haw on his feet Is not amusing; but the
came gentleman on his head is worth an
orchestra-chair.' When a man wears his
trousers where other men wear their
coats, people are bound to turn around.
It is not a new trick. â¢ â¢ Please, please,
Cybele. don't take it seriously!" (D. Ap
[ pleton & Co., New York.)
" THE MAN OF THE HOUR "

"The only use of repenting is; to fix

Peggy, with precocious gallantry; .and
adored his mother, Olgaj the? beautffui; i
"proud and sentimental, Russian yPrincess:. j
Heaven knows : those scenes' : \u25a0rousts read
honey sweet to loving motherhood, either
achieved or anticipated. * He was such a
manly little man and ;withal , so -tenderly
artectionate with. that adolf scent dawn of
virility. .Full, valiantly, albeit her, haute'ur'l
made his- little heart go"' hot:and^acrti'ng',
many a time, .he staid with' his gallantry 'l;
to his playmate, Peggy; ' arid \u25a0 the royalty,
of nature way. be" lbved his"; Princess
motherâ that must have been a very balm
of Gilead to her aching heart.' One scene
of this beautiful : love the ; artist has pic
tured for \u25a0 us. With his - arms 'clasped
round her neck and ] his cheek pressed
against hi r brow,' he says: * "Mamma, I
wisht you was a Queen." To this the
sentimental and renunciative noblewoman
replies: "In Russia I was a Princess once.
\u2666 \u2666 â¢ It Is wrong that there should ;be
Princesses or Queens or any such people.
I They ' only oppress " the poor. â¢ They have
.noright to have- their beautiful, palaces
and live In luxury while the poor people
toil for them, .who' haven't even;, black
! bread to eat." . *.
There la.' another sentimental scene
which I think can be trusted, unaided by
the artist's picture, to the power of Oc
tave Thanet's pen 'to create a responsive
swell of sentiment in your,heart. I trust
I am treating her fairly in presenting It
as a sample of the kind of ,wo"rk in
which her art Is at its best: \u25a0â¢-\u25a0\u25a0
"His mother was crying, crying, so that
her tears wet his cheeks and her beauti
ful white throat trembled. â¢."â¢.-.â¢.- She .
said things in Russian, 'T. loving things
which he understood, because* she had
said them before, and ? dreadful . things,
which he only caught .. in snatches," about
some one who waa Ice and Iron and
cruelâ crueler than death. '
"Cut it short, plga," said his father
coldly. /..'.,*. T r'uJ' 1 "
"Hia mother 1 dropped her arms.. She
drew; a long breath; she looked Into his
eyes; it was the Princess Galatsuin, whose,
ancestors had been Princes and brave
soldiers for centuries, who" began to
speak very slowly, using the language
which her son was surest to understand.
Her eyes glowed- through her, tears.
; "Ivan, my dear little son," she began.
"I have to tell you something hard, and
you must bear it bravely."
" "Yes, mamma," said Johnny- Ivan;- his

_"I thought I could take you' with; hie;

"I must go, Ivan." /
"Butâ but you'll come back," mamma?"
"I'll see you again, Ivan, be sure . I'll
see you again. I can't tell when, : but I
will. I surely will. And youâ ah, thank

It was only 'that Johnny-Ivan had

again. In a way." The historian tella us
"the decisive factor in the renaissance
movement was Uhe conviction that ths
hitherto exclusive ecclesiastical abso
lutism had as little Justification or. au
thority In Intellectual as In political
life." The reaction toward more Indi
vidual rights Is expressed' thus: "The
medieval church had suppressed and
ignored the individual, whereas now
man came Into his full rights again and
dared to unfold his individual talents
and capabilities to the utmost.. Conse
quently the whole movement has been
aptly called HumaJiiam. Its cradle stood
in Italy." In his last paragraph Pruts
mentions the great significance of the
introduction of the art of printing to
the renaissance movement. "Not until
then was It possible for the great intel
lectual and religious leaders of the time
to Influence the mass of their contem
poraries: for now tne written word can*
be indefinitely multiplied with compara
tive ease.'*

OPIE READ'S SKETCHES
APPEAR IN BOOK FORM
The sketches under the title. "An
American In New York," written by Opi**
Read and published in the Saturday Even-
Ing Post, are now collected In book form
and Illustrated by Emlln McConneil and
Howard Heath. The author of "A Ken
tucky Colonel" here gives us a story oÂ£
another Southern colonel and strings thi
sketches together with a romantic love
story whoae denouement brings surprise.
The title Is intended as a playful sarcasm
upon New York's being so different from
the rest of the country that going then*
was like going out to America. The colo
nel tells a bellboy at the Waldorf that he
had lived out in America and that his.
coming to New York was his first trip
abroad. He is an old fashioned, gentle
man and keeps up a frank air of acknowl
edgment of the - rights of chivalry, sen
timent and romance to still reign even in
this so ' practical age. He is , sincere and
sensible.; in hia living out of this inward
belief,' and Opie Read does not quite
quixote him into a chlvalric foolâ as -\ do
some other noted authors in their cari
caturing of men of that genus.
. â¢ "Why do you call yourself an American
lii New York?" Inquired Mrs. Flashroll of
the colonel_,when she met him at the Wal
dorf. "Because, madam. I have lived
nearly, all over America, and this Is thÂ«*
only town â¢ that puts me In mind of a
country, that I have never seen." He ob
jects very much to the system of petty
bribery he , flnd3 established in the city,
but he finally has to adapt himself to It.
for , as be says, "There Is nothing so tire
less as Insolence." and he buys freedom
from It by yielding to the un-American
custom : Imported, from foreign lands of
flunkylzlng the human beings who serve
us. The colonel's gallantry to strange wo
men in distress came very near to* get
ting him bunkoed In the case of one of
the charmers at the hotel; but when she
pretended he had lost her purse he clev
erly solved the embarrassing situation by
handing her his own. She drove off In her
carriage feeling satisfied with her ruse
and the night's "*. work. His purse was
stuffed full of pieces ot dry goods he had
been Instructed to match. When a cham
bermaid robbed his room of a fifty-dollar
bank note and the magistrate was about
to pass sentence upon her the colonel
became compassionate. "Walt a morfsent.
JudgeV he said, "let me see that bill.
Why, this la the one I gave her, and she
couldn't â¢ have stolen what was already
her own." So the sketches go In a light
vein of humor and mixed with somÂ«
pathos. So many people liked to reatl
"The 'â Starbucks" that the author can
probably feel assured his old following
will still follow him as he recounts the
adventures of the good-natured colonel
In New York.

DEATH OF MRS. DODGE
A LOSS TO YOUNG FOLK
The, death of Mrs. Mary Mapes Dodge,
which occurred at her summer home, On
teora Park, in the Catskills, on Monday
last." means more to the young people of
this: country than they may perhaps yet
realize. ; The St. Nicholas Magazine waa
created.- or was started, perhaps I should >
say, because of Mrs. Dodge. â¢ Scribner &
Co.. as' the firm style then was, the pub
lishers! of St. Nicholas, and the now Cen
tury : Magazine, \u25a0 knew that the name and j
work of Mary. Mapes Dodge were as good
as several hundred thousand dollars >In
the launching of a young -people's maga-_
tine. ;; Mrs. Dodge was th^n known
throughout the world as the author of
"Hans -Brinker," a book that has had
almost ;"as many readers as "Robinson
.Crusoe." ' It has* been translated Into
every modern language, and is a classic
in those languages as well as in English.
The scene of the story la laidÂ» in Hoi
land,- as every ' one " knows, but at the
t'me that Mrs. ' Dodge , wrote the book
she ; had ; never Visited . Holland, but shÂ»
had read f omnlvorously on .the ; aubject,
and had talked with people who had
lived there, : natives" and , f oreijners. The
\u25a0lory is told, and I happen to know s that*

ehop for the book . that ; would - give . the \u25a0

WOULD CHANCE
SCHOOL SYSTEM
Sir William Richmond, the
Boyal Academician, Says
Hand Should Help Brain
FytcUil Dispatch to The CalL
LONDON. Sept. 2.â Sir William B.
Richmond, the distinguished Royal Acad
emician, has been giving an interviewer
some radical views on art, education and
things in general. According to Sir Wll
liam our much-vaunted . twentieth cen
tury progress docs not amount to much.
The multiplication of art schools af
fords hhn little satisTactloh: He thinks
their tccdeory -is to utine the ' individual
ity.'of the student rather- than < to promote
it and aho-'result^ts' a* : "dead* level of
mcuJocrltyÂ»''?The.incdern system of edu-,
cation he finds equally disappointing. "\u25a0
"Of course." he says. "I am ln favor of
education for the people in general, but I
have little faith in mere book learning
apart from practice. " If the decision 'lay
with me, I would turn all the technical
schools Into board schools; and vice-versa.
You may cail^ it ray creedâ that the hand
end the brain are meant to be of mutual
scn-ic* to each other; both act and re
act mutually. brain cannot be doing
its Â«-ork unlcssThfT- band is occupied. '.-;.
"I would like to' see the education of
the masses-r^of the childrenâ^rcduced to
the '\u25a0simplest-, imaginable fiorm â the
three R's.'.drawing. singing, and, above
aJI, the observation of nature. You
know â¢SmilesCLives of tlie Engineers.'
Those eighteenth "century men, what
'eplendid fellows they were; what crea
tive energy, "what "\u25a0 individuality! \Y<ti
they had little education in the modern.
B'-nse of .the word. but. they had. educa
tion of character. They didn't^llke
'nips' <>f; knowledgeâ there v/as no Edu
cational dram-drlnklng In- those days.
They did- their, day's work . and then
â¢hey drank deep draughts of intellec-'
tual al*>! Well, we have had enough of
our modern " system of education to seÂ«
now the result is turning out Has it
produced, is it producing, such strong,
independent individualities ,/as was the
case beforehand, in what we call less
advantageous times?"
RESPECT FOR THE ARTIST.
He favors an increase in the labor
members of the House of Comons "as
a counterpoise to the Interested, rich,
selfish middle classes â especially. of the
jsouveau rlche^ â who now make legisla
tive halls their happy hunting ground;
the stronghold of \u25a0 vested interests." \.V
Perhaps recalling some severe critir
cisms that were passed upon him for
bis share in the administration of the
Chantrey; bequest, he expresses "thft
opinion that "true artists", are not
t properly appreciated in England. They
are: better understood by Italians and
Greeks. y
"The creative power of the artist
has to them," be says, "to this day,
something of the : supernatural -, com
manding respect. The very ,facully;<>f
being able to sketch makes-thenvyotii
friends. I was once captured'- by bri
gands in Greece, and as soon as I. told
them I was -an artist and proved; it-: to
their satisfaction they apologized and
.released me." .. , ";
.'.' This. Incident admits of another ex
planation which is not so flattering
either to Sir, William or the brigands.
It ",Is, that experience had taught them
that artists were generally. poor devils
and not worth holding for ransom.

THE SAN FRANCISCO , CALL, SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 3, 1905.
"The conditions of . life," - she continues, I
"are changing rapidly. We are in a state
of transition, an unsettled state, passing
from one phase to /another. : : It is very
much a question whether we shall rise a
step higher In the scale of being or 'reel
back into the ' blast and be no s more,' as
all the older nations, yielding to the evil
that was In them, have done in turn. The
signs of. -the.t imes are pretty evenly bal

Tyson and W. Wood, indicted for out
fitting the Carmencita for a seal poach
ing cruise, argued a demurer yesterday
in the United States District Court.
The defense outlined in the demurrer
is that the indictment does not charge
a commission of any crime. The coun
eel contend that there is no law in the
United States prohibiting the killing
of seals In the Bering Sea. except by
a. citizen of the United States or by the
use of a vessel of American registry.
..' It is contended that the Carmencita
when she proceeded to the Bering Sea
â¢was under Mexican registry and that
by operation of law her crew were no
longer American, but Mexican citizens.
The matter was taken under advise

American Embassador Leases
Earl Cowper's Magnificent
Property at Wrest Park
GARDENS A: MILE LONG
Estate Is One of the Most
Beautiful in England arid
Situated Close to London
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, Sept. 2.â By leasing from
Earl Cowper that . nobleman's Bedford
shire seat,; Wrest .Park, Embassador
Reid establishes himself on a scale of
domestic magnificence far. beyond that
maintained by' any -previous American
representing his country at the court
of St. James. : With Dorchester House
in the center of '.desirable residential
London and Wrest Park for the months
when "every one" ; leaves : town, the
Reids are ideally situated for - their
own comfort and pleasure j with facil
ities for entertaining if they so desire
in a manner exceeding the expectations,
of those who prophesied that the fam
ily's official career \u25a0 in '". this . country
would be exceptionally .brilliant , so
cially. ' : : â¢ â¢ .
.Wrest Park estate is" really one of
the most beautiful in the United King
dom, and far more deslrable-than many
because it Is only \u25a0\u25a0.'\u25a0 thirty-eight - miles
from town. ,This distance \u25a0â¢ Mri; 'Reid,
will travel twice a : day in going â¢to
and from the offices of the \ American
embassy in Victoria stfreet. .
The house was built in 1836 by one
of the last Earls de Grey, in whose
family the place has been since the
Conqueror's time. Lady Anne Florence,
Baroness Lucas, was the eldest daugh
ter of this Earl and it was her mar
riage to the sixth Earl of Cowper that
brought the grand old place . down to
the .present owner, who ] is the sev
enth holder of; the title. \ "
Before beginning the present manor
house Earl de Grey destroyed all traces
of the "structure to- which he fell heir,
and, although '\u25a0_ his ancestors .planned
the grand canals' and planted most of
the glorious . avenue :of ': trees | and
hedges, there are ancient men - em
ployed on the estate to-day* who "as
small boys remember Earl de Grey
pegging out with pins and line designs
for the wonderful gardens 'now in ex
istence. '
Built of reddish stone which con
trasts strikingly.: with the abundance
of green foliage on, all sides, the house
is considered, one of - the litaest renais
sance structures in England. For the
use of a small family like Mr. Reid's
or for the entertainment of a large
company the place leaves little to be
desired and Englishmen .Who know the
likely estates up and down their island
consider the American Embassador
most fortunate. '. \u25a0
Standing in. his front door Mr. Reid
will look acrossa mile of gardens laid
out in various beautiful designs in
which exquisite statuary plays
inent part, while beyond these'lie acres
of wide velvety lawns shaded' by giant
trees, orchards, garden houses and . an
orangery containing trees whose par
ent stock came from the private grove
of Louis Philippe of France. â¢
â¢ Beside Wrest Park, Earl Cowper,
who is a past Viceroy^ of Ireland and
a Knight of the Garter, owns \u25a0* two
other large country estates: Panshang
er in Hertfordshire and" Ratling Court
in Kent, as well as a townhouse?ln St.

SIGNATURES
Portsmouth Treaty
Practically
Completed.
Envoys to Attach Their
Names Within a
Day or Two.
Article Belating to the Evacu
ation of Hanchrria Is
Agreed Upon.
PORTSMOUTH, 3V. H., Sept. 2^â The
last point In dispute betv.rcn Russia
and Japan wa<i arrsnKcd at a meeting:
of the peace plenipotentiaries which
ended al 11 oVloclc to-night.
As the plenipotentiaries emerged
from Mr. de Witte's room, where the
conference was held. Baron Rosen was
asked if a final agreement had been
reached. He did not answer.
"Will there be a meeting: to-mor
row?" v\~ '.
"Xo," he replied, "there is no neces
sity for one; the, clerks can do the
rest."
It is now understood that the treaty
will consist of seventeen articles, pre
ceded by a short preamble, in which,
it is asserted on good authority, no al
lusion will be made to the action dis
played by President Roosevelt in
bringing about the peace conference
which led to the conclusion of the
treaty.
The treaty will be signed in a day
or two â perhaps on Monday.
The treaty will not be engrossed by
the two caligraphers sent by thÂ« State
Dtr-artnient. At the last moment it'
was decided to have attaches of the two
missions ptrform the work.. ,
The articles relating to the non
fortification of the island of Saghalien
and La Perouse Strait and the evacua
tion of Manchuria were settled to-night.
Both parties bind themselves not to for
tify the island. La Perouse is to be
"open" and Japan agrees not to erect
\u25a0works to command the strait.
The article relating to the evacuation
of Manchuria provides that the troops,
immediately upon the exchange of final
ratifications, are to be withdrawn, re
spectively, to the lines of Mukden and
Harbin. The number of "railway
guards" in ordinary times is limited,
but provision Is made for the dispatch
of trooi>s for the protection of the line
in case of disorder, upon condition that
they be withdrawn immediately when
their mission is flnisned.
There. axe said to be four "annexes"
to the treaty, covering: matters which
could not be elaborated in the treaty

When Far l'roxu Lsnd.
KEW YORK. Sept. 2. â How the news
of the Russian-Japanese peace agree
ment was flashed about the Atlantic
Ocean and received by vessels still sev
eral days out of port and hundreds of
mll^s beyond direct communication
with wireless telegraph stations on
land was reported by the steamship La
Lorraine, which arrived here to-day.
Last Thursday, while La Lorraine was
about SOO miles east of New York, the
peace message was suddenly caught on
its wireless instruments, and the
sender was learned to be the steam
ship Kron Prlnz Wilhelm. bound for

IXCEEASE OF CRDIE
IN FRENCH CAPITAL
Said to Be Due to Practical
Abolishment of Capital
Punishment.
Special Cable to The Call and New York Her
ald Copyright. 1903 by thÂ» XÂ«w York
Her&ld Publishing Company.
PARIS, Sept. 2.â M. Edmund Lepelle
tier, a Deputy of the Seventeenth Arln
dls-ement, taking as a text the Increase of
crime and lawlessness In Paris, has writ
ten to the Minister of Justice a letter de
claring that the present conditions are
the result of the practical abolition of
capital punishment. The absence of even
a place to put the guillotine, he writes,
gives a sense of security to dangerous
criminals. They see there is no place for
the execution of the death sentence, and
jwrsuade themselves that they can mur
der "with impunity.
IJEAYY DAMAGE DONE
BY FOREST FIRES
Several Farmhouses and
Much Timber in Oregon
Are Destroyed.
PORTLAND, Sept. 2.â Reports from the
Willamette* Valley points are to the ef
fect that heavy damage is being occa
sioned by forest fires. In addition to the
two reported yesterday from the neigh
borhood of Albany, which have destroy
ed several farmhouses as well as much
timber, there are fires to the east ; and
west of Eugene which bid fair, to Inflict
heavy losses unless they , are got under
control at once. Fires , are numerous in
the Grant* Pass district, but so far have
caused small loss, as they have been con
fined to brush slashing or, second growth
trees. Albany ; and Eugene are ;â¢ covered
with a pall of dense smoke.

United States.
BERLIN, Sept. 2.â The record to-night
stands at fifty-one cholera cases and
nineteen deaths, a steady increase and a:
high percentage of 'mortality. The most;
uneasy news for America is that a sec
ond case exists at Hamburg. It was of
ticially reported late to-day that a la
borer In St. George's Hospital, where the
Russian emigrant died, has cnolera, but
it is added that the seizure is of a milder ,
form than the previous one. Two of the
other fresh cases are .in East Prussia,
indicating that the infected area has wid
ened. The Imperial Health Office, a3
shown by the statement made to-day to
the Associated Press, is confident that It
has the d.sease in hand. The most.re
cently reported victims are among the
Russian river men in quarantine.,
I Germany's two greatest bacteriologists.
Professor Robert Koch and E. yon Ley
den, are out of the country, one. in -Af
rica and the other jln Tyrol. Professor
Adolph Kafka, also an eminent man,' is
Prgfessor Koch' 3 successor as head of
the Institute of Infectious Diseases, and
he has gone to the infected district to di
rect the measures to confine the. disease..
The Institute of Infectious Diseases will
be open all. night examining .secretions
taken from the digestive tubes of persons
who died under circumstances suggesting,
cholera. From time to time couriers arr
rive from some port of Germany with :
portions of bodies done, up hermetically.
The Ministry, of the Interior has issued
an order covering all Prussia requiring
physicians Immediately after the death
of any suspected patient to send a mes
senger with . sections of the alimentary
canal to the Institute for Infectious Dis
eases for thorough examination. .
AO DANGER TO UXITED STATES.
PARIS, Sept. 2.â Professor F. Metch
nikoff was seen, at- the Pasteur Institute
to-day and gave an interesting expres
sion, of his view of the cholera in Ger
many. The professor said he considered
from the bacteriological examination
made under his personal direction that
the cases arc unquestionably Asiatic chol
era. , ,
Notwithstanding this Professor
Metchnikoff expressed the most posi
tive conviction that the German au
thorities could cope with the disease
and prevent Its spread ' in Europe.
"I can assure you," he said, "from
the inquiry I have made and from
personal familiarity with . the cholera ;
cases in Germany that there .is' no
ground for anxiety relative to a gen
eral outbreak of cholera or its spread
through Europe." â¢ â¢ '-'\u25a0'.. .
"Could there be any "danger to the
United .States owing: to the steamship
lines connecting Hamburg,. to Amer- j
lea?" the professor was asked.
"I do not think so." was the, reply,
"when everybody in Germany is on- the
alert to prevent the -spread of the dis
ease, arid it is my opinion that extra
ordinary precautions will not be" nec
essary in the United States." . ;
Dr. Aubert.of the Bureau of Public
Health" stated that there was not the
slightest apprehension of an attack of
cholera in Paris.

\u25a0'Driven 'at a terrific ratÂ© of speed by a
motorman new at "the crank, a crowded,
car of the Eighteenth-street lino whirled
round the - sharp curve at Sixteenth and
Kansas streets, last night, hurling a dozen
'passengers Into'ths street." \- Four of thsm
| Â«re terribly injured. One, Miss Lena. Mur
i phy.fa^gtrt.vwiU die. s Nearly every
body on the car was hurt. The motor
man; Thbrwald Anderson, fled for his life
with an angry mob after him. The con
ductor, William Quillman. was seized and
beaten almost into insensibility.
When the heavy car whirled down the
: curve, it was thought that the motorman
had lost control of It. There was a wild
scramble inside and those on the dummy
clung: to the stanchions. The car .was
going so rapidly that- they were afraid to
Jump. < â¢'. .; . J. ; \u25a0
While women shrieked and men .turned
white, the car sped on to the curve. The
vehicle gave a sudden lurch and the pas
sengers were flung In all dlrdltlons. Near
ly every pane of glass was" shattered and
the fragments flung into the (faces of the
crowd Inside. Jammed in a heap and help
less as rats in a trap. For an instant the
heavy car balanced on tts side and threat
ened to topple over. It righted, however,
and .was brought to a standstill. \
, There was a scene of the wildest con
fusion; People living in the vicinity
crowded around. Passengers from other
: cars joined them. "Kill the motorman."
somebody suggested. Anderson heard the
suggestion . and took to his * heels. ' *
' Somebody was calm enough to think
of the wounded. An ambulance was tele
i phoned for and the injured were gathered
| together. The worst injured were hur
riedly bundled into the car and Conduc
tor Quillman. who was formerly a motor
man, ran It to the Potrero Hospital.
From there they were taken to the Cen
tral Emergency Hospital. Others made
their way to hospitals as best they could.
GIRL FATALLY INJURED. '
Following is' the list of the injured:
Miss Lena Murphy, fracture of the skull,
will die:, Mrs. Grace Malcom. shock con

; tusions; Baby Haley, cut by flying glass:'
J. . W. Lord, severe contusions, and Mrs*
jJ. Wilson. Many others were hurt, hut
left the scene before their names could be
ascertained. .
Miss Murphy, who was sitting- on the
front dummy, was hurled fully fifteen
feet. She struck on the back of her
head, after turning a complete somer-
s ault. The unfortunate young woman
had not regained consciousness up to a
late hour,' and Drs. W. E. Stevens and
Tilton Tillman, 1 who treated her. say
her : case <is hopeless. Mrs. Malcom sat
on the rear, dummy beside Frank Graf
! ton and ; his wife of 420 Harkness street.
I The three people were precipitated into
the street and all sustained serious in
juries. : Mrs. Graf ton received a severe
scalp wound and was badly brul3ed.
Her right ankle was sprained and. she
suffered from , shock. . Mrs.- Malcom â¢ Is
seriously hurt. She suffers from ( 'a
blow, in the abdomen, numerous contu
sions and possible internal injuries.
i Frank Graf ton, who is a yarnlsher and
1 polisher, suffered a wrenched shoulder
| and was greneraly contused. -
i As soon as the accident - happened the
injured ' were placed ; on the"- car and the
angry mob compelled the conductor to .

at his business, having been with the
railroad but fifteen days. Owing to the
negligence of the Potrero police in not
arresting the motorman at once the
true details of the cause of the acci
dent could not be learned. When asked
If the motorman was not to be charged
sitb battery the Potrero police said
that they did not know whether they
would arrest him. Lieutenant Conboy
of the Southern station was communi
cated with and he at once ordered a
policeman s^nt after the motorman.
All of the passengers are loud in
their denunciation of the actions of the
rnotorman. They aver that when he
lost control of the car. if such was the
case, he should have warned them, giv
ing them a chance for their lives.
Again, they contend, Anderson ran his
car down the Sixteenth-street hill at a
terrible rate of speed, far too fast for
safety.
The railroad company, always reti
cent in regard to the faults of its em
ployes, refused to give any cause for
the accident.
Anderson was .arrested late last
night. "We are not allowed to talk,"
he said, "but I was not going very fast.
I often go as fast as I did last night.
When we got to the curve the people
fell off. That's all I know about it."
Conductor Quillinan was also arrested.
Each was released on 550 bail.
One of the miraculous escapes was that
cf Mrs. J. Wilson's baby. The mother
was flung with terrible force from one
side of the car to the other. She hugged
the buby so tightly to her breast that she
managed to protect It somehow.
The exact number of the injured will
not be known for some time. The car
was crowded to the guards when it sped
around the curve.
Contractor Run Dona Irv Car.
S.A. Henin, a contractor, 417 Kearny
street, was run down by a Valencia
street car at Third and Market streets
shortly after midnight this morning
and received several lacerations of the
scalp. A McAllister-street car jumped
the track at Fillmore 6treet at 9 o'clock
last night and three men were thrown
to the ground. "A -call was sent in for
the ambulance, but when it arrived the
three men had departed.

Testimony of Several Army
Officers Is Strongly^ in
Favor of the Captain
HINTS AT CONSPIRACY
Major Morton Makes Plain
Statement Concerning In
- cideiit at Fort Leavenworth
Special Dispatch ;to Tba . Call.
WOOSTER, Ohio, Sept. 2.â -Contrary
to expectations, the evidence in rebuttal
in the Taggart divorce case was not
concluded to-day. : and, as it now stands,"
it will hardly -be finished ? before â¢ noon
on Tuesday next, when argument- is E to
be .begun. \u25a0 - . V
The testimony submitted this morning
was all by deposition and all very fav
orable to" Captain Taggart. "Major Mor
ton, by deposition.' swore that he was
intimately associated with Captain Tag
gart during most of his' military
career, and particularly during the trou
ble at Fort Leaven worth; that he never
knew or heard of Taggart being intoxi
cated, and that there was absolutely
nothing wrong with him, either mentally
or physically, when be was confined at
Fort Leavenworth.
On cross-examination the witness was
asked about the .gossip at the post con
cerning Taggart's confinement, and If it
did not assign as a reason the. fact
that Taggart had beaten his ; wife. Morr
tori' replied that this was one qt the rea
sons given, but far from being the prln-\
cipal one. On ? examination the
witness was asked: Â£ \u25a0 â¢
"What were some of the other rea
sons assigned, in the gossip concerning
Taggart's confinement?"
"The reason mest J assigned was that
the post commander desired to keep
Taggart where he could not talk."
The deposition of Colonel Van
Rensselaer Hoff was H read i in rebuttal.
He said that his residence was close to
Taggart's \at j Fort Leavenworth, and
that, although the windows of his house
were all open on the night of June 30,
he. heard no screams from the Taggart
house. .He said the captain's habits
were always exemplary. â¢ â¢

Young A\%nan Now Tells
of Plot -to Assassinate
fcpecial ; Dispatch to The .Call
OMAHA, Nebr.; Sept. 2.â Sensational
charges of conspiracy -to assassinate
her are : being prepared by Miss Mac
attorneys .in this : city. Miss
Wood; declares that" when the papers
areready she will take them to Wash
ington and lile them In person with the
Secretary of StateC-. The charges are di
rected ; against Secretary . Loeb, .former
Postmaster General Wynne and J. Mar
tin Miller, at present' Consul at Aix-la-
Chapelle, who, according to Miss Wood's
statement, "knew, that ; it ; was \u25a0 neces
sary to get me out of the way in order
to further the y political scheme /Â£hey
were working against' Senator Platt."
T. Miss _Woo<i;alleges<.that she was en
ticed â¢to New. York-at the instance of
Miller, .who was in the employ of those
arrayed: against her, for no other pur
pose than jto have her done away with.
When she arrived in New York she ex
pected to receive the proof sheets of
"The Love; Letters of a Boss,'* which
she was about. to publish, but when she
made: a demand for either them" or the
manuscript, she says,' it was refused by
Miller.. She also alleges that secret ser
vice men from the American Express
Company, hirelings \u25a0 of Senator 'Platt,
kept constant watch' upon .her,, and one
of ;these agents, "-while. dining with her
in the : Victoria Hotel, placed poison in
her soup.' She detected him' 'in the act,
however, and did not partake of any
of ! the soup.'
On another occasion, 'Miss Wood, de
clares, 7 sne set a, pitcher outside her
door- for some, cracked ice, which : she
had ordered,' and a powder was placed
in V the pitcher by agents of .Wynne,
Loeb and Miller, which 'would \u25a0 have
caused her instant death if she had
drunk any of the water.
Miss Wood declares she will certainly
obtain service on Secretary Loeb in the
damage suit filed I here some time ago,
even if , she. has to transfer, the case to
Washington in order to do so, and that
she will compel him to tell the truth of
the whole conspiracy. -
"It was Loeb who telephoned Platt
.that I: intended to sue him for breach
of promise," says Miss Wood, "and 'I
can prove that the . telephoning was
done .from the White House. It was
merely a political scheme and they ex
pected to hold .this' over Platt's head
and make him support Roosevelt, for he
had' already -announced that he would
support some other candidate for the
Presidency."

No joy or pleasure on this earth quite
equals that which comes into the home
vrhen baby arrives. Who can describe
the happiness of man and woman, joined
in wedlock, as they look upon the fragile,
delicate mite that is blood of th<ir blood'
end flesh of their flesh ? And who can
depict the hopelessness and dejection
that hover about the , home where \u25a0 the
wife is incapable of becoming a mother?
Barrenness proceeds from some derange-
ment of the distinctly feminine organs.
Many of the common ailments known as
'* ! f er-iale troubles ' ' cause it. Dr. Pierces
Favorite Prescription overcomes barren-
ness by stamping out diseases of women,
and by healing and curing ulceration. . It
tones up the system,' stops drains, and
restores strength. During gestation it
podiSes morning sickness, gives elastic-
ity to the overstrained parts concerned,
nates the hour of baby's coming short
and almost painless, ana gives wonderful
recuperative power to the . patient. By
caking the mother strong and cheerful,
it makra the little one healthy, vigorous
and good natured. Insist upon the med-
icine dealer giving you Dr. Pierces Fa-
vorite Prescription when you ask for it.
Substitute* are often dangerous.
Mm. Junes W. Blacfcer, of 6aj Catherine St.

done wonders for me. For years my health was
very poor; I bad four miscarriages, but since

BY JAMES C. CRAWFORD.
Barney Branch must have been in
jocular mood when he stepped into the
..restaurant at- 263 O'Farrell street, for
he Immediately addressed the pro
prietor .of the place as follows:
"P. Saulovlch, you'll soon be rich; in
your good luck there ain't no hitch."
When informed that his meter was
defective, inasmuch as the final syllable
of Saulovlch is pronounced "vlck," he
laughingly amended it by exclaiming:
."P. Saulovich, you'll make me sick
If I don't get some fresh eggs quick."
"Adam an' Eve in midocean for a
gent!" yelled the waiter to the invis
ible cook, and Mr. Branch, Imagining
he -was -being trifled with, ceased smil
ing and requested the napkin flourisher
to refrain fromattempting-wit. "For,"
he added severely. "I ordered eggs." I
"An' that's what I ordered for you,"
was the response. "How do you want
'em cooked?"
"Fried on one side," . replied Mr.
Branch, In softened tone.
"Burn 'em sunny side up!" shouted
the waiter, and from the kitchen
wafted" a mumbled "side up."
"Say. young fellow, I don't like your
way of ordering my grub,", said Mr.
Branch. "I guess I'll j have them eggs*
scrambled â do you hear â scrambled."
"Shipwreck "em!" roared the waiter.
Patrolman Sam Orr testified that
when he arrived at Saulovich's he saw
Mr. Branch/ standing amid a heap of
broken crockery and valiantly fighting
the four men empfbyed in the estab
lishment. How the conflict started the
officer - did hot know, nor could Mr.
Saulovlch nor any j of his . aids explain
with any degree of coherence the pro
ceedings subsequent to those herein
before narrated.-
All that the defendant could tell Po
lice Judge Mogan was that the slang
flinging waiter provoked the combat by
adhering to his unintelligible verbal
code when communicating with the
culinary department. Eggs he did 'not
allude to by that designation. When a
steak was ordered he yelled, "One trunk
hinge." and when the defendant plainly
stated that be desired pork sausages
the kitchen; was vociferously notified
that he wanted "a Hebrew funeral."
He would not swear that he was struck
before he Emote. But If ho did strike
the first blow, was not the provocation
sufficient to justify him in so doing?
Mr. Saulovich appraised his loss of
crockery at $25, and' the Judge post
poned sentencing Mr. Branch until next
"Wednesday and lnitmated that payment
of the damage would be given due con
sideration in the. fixing of the. punish

.Mrs.' Emily Maloney,; middle-aged, tall
and angular, told Judge* Fritz that "she
was slumming when Patrolman Nelson
arrested her for drunkenness on Pacific
street at a late hour last Friday. : . '
"I own my home and two lots on the
3700 block of Folsom street," she said,
"and since my husband went to Alaska
I have been lonesome, and thought a lit
tie elummln g would cheer me up a bit."
As ehe pleaded she nibbled a large red
onion, and when asked by the bench why
she did so her. answer; was to the effect
that the odoriferous vegetable was''cura
tive of Indigestion, -of which malady she
had long been a victim. Bailiff "Jack"
Conlon thereupon* Indulged In a skeptical
sneer, and Mrs. Maloney nudged his right
side, with her left 'elbow and chuckllngly.
whispered, "Now, don't . you me
away." !
After she had been riven thirty days
the bailiff explained to the Judge that
onion-gnawing was Mrs. Maloney's fa- 1
vorite method of preventing detection of j

tle boys and their respective dogs teased ;
him until he took a knife from his pocket
and pursued them. .; Both \ the' boyÂ« \ and j
the dogs easily outstripped him ; in' the j
race, however, owing, to his : unsteadiness |
of gait, and with great fury and with re
markable accuracy of aim. he hurled the
weapon at Johnny Haley's dog. The blade :
penetrated the animal's ; left flank, r in- !

repeated the tale jof her husband's queer
infatuation for Mrs. Welch, who is neith

When questioned by the Judge, ' Mrs.

her husband, a soldier,', having deserted
her soon after their marriage, about

CHOOSES BETWEEN
HORRIBLE DEATHS
Workman Grasps Live Wire
â¢ to Escape Falling Into
Hot Metal.
CHICAGO. Sept. 2. â Nels Anderson, a
motor Inspector for the Illinois Steel
Company, chose death by electrocution
tn preference to a. more horrible fate
in one of the company's seething metal
pit* to-day at the South Chicago works.
Anderson was doing: repair xrork on
the arm of a crane directly above one
of the hot metal pits. A slight move
ment of the arm caused him to lose his
balance. The only support within
reach was an uninsulated live wire,
which connected the crane with power.
Anderson gave one glance at the white
hot metal below and caught the wire as
lie was falling-. He was almost Instant
ly killed and the body hung: over the
wire until the current could be chut off|
Death is thought to have been Instan
taneous.

Life Harris, a character that will go
down in the history of the develop
ment of the great <ie&erts of Nevada to
aa undying lame, is one of the most
uuassumint men the world has ever
known, lie Is quiet and forceful, of
xuagnidctnL physique and of undeviat
ing sternness oi purpose. He is rec
cÂ£uizbti as oiie of the pioneers of Tono
pa.h, Goldfceld and Bullfrog, and when
he extended the writer an invitation to
tÂ£o wita him to the i<unerÂ«.l Kiuiga
country it was eagerly accepted.
Lijje Harris, prospector, na.s ragged
theke liaxreu, waste aaid mystic siretcnes
or sagetiruaii and saud until U:e mys
teries were no lunger exisieat and the
sileaee had tpoken with a thousajad
tongues. Out of the blue and purple
uifitauces he has plucked the glamour,
itocx the unyielding mountains he has
evoked a golden realism, and as he
v.anuereti in familiar places he has
placed his mark on the wastes in a
writing legible to himself alone and
making pia.in the treasures in Â£old ore
lie i;ad foand.
It was & long and seemingly unend
ing Quest, and whenever his provisions
Â£2ive out he wouid return to Bullfrog
lor more. His '"oiacks"' became known
from one Â«nd of Southwestern Nevada
to the other. On each recurrent trip to
Bullfrog they came In lacien with some
200 pounds of ere from the different lo
calities jus unerring judgment had
selected as treasure-bearing. These
specimens he had assayed, and the
silent man kept to himself the source
Xroin which he had secured the rock.
To his surprise, the ore after assaying
proved much richer than he had antici
pated. It was then that he decided to
make a two weeks" trip for the purpose
of making a thorough investigation of
the claims from which lie had obtained
tiie most promising specimens. 1 had
â¢ had dreams of untold wealth, and when
1 was asked to go with him on this trip
into an unproven and unknown coun
try. I grasped at the opportunity with
an eagerness I have seldom shown in
any oi life's undertakings.
Our ultimate destination was reached
ufter a three days' journey over the hot
and rough roads of the desert. It was
a place called Greenwater. It took us
three days from Bullfrog, and at no
time during the journey could we pro
ceed faster than, a walk. We carried
everything necessary for a trip of this
kind â water, provisions and the like.
We journeyed along over the illimit
able wastes of the desert with nothing
to gladden the eye save the gray sage
brush and the white-gray sand of the
desert, with an occasional bit of color
"in the outcroppings to be found in the
various buttes that dotted the land
scape. We arrived, at about 6p. m., and
the first thing that it was necessary for
us to do was to prepare food and then
tor the enjoyment of a sleep to put us
in shape for the work of the morrow.
The desert nights are beautiful and as
a general rule cool enough to insure a
sound slumber. We were up again at
â¢i a. m. and after breakfast we started
to locate some of the finest looking
ground one could imagine. I knew as
much about this as a baby does, but the
trarned and unerring eye of Lige did
not take long to set us all at work lay
ing our lines and putting up the monu
ments. A monument is a bunch of
rocks gathered from. any place you can
get them and piled one on top of an
other so as to be four feet at the base
and four feet high. Imagine our work
in the hot, broiling' sun, at a tempera
ture of about 113 degrees, gathering
and piling these bowlders. On each
claim taken nine of these beautiful
piles must be put up according to law.
As I was not accustomed to the heat, I
was compelled to take a rest after
building one monument. The rest was
for about half an hour, and when I
started I had to simply drag i myself
along. We kept this good work going
for a couple of days, until our water
." had got so low that we decided to re
turn and "record" our new possessions.
Good fortune seems to have attended
us in these new locations, for within a
few months a railroad will be within
live miles of our place, and then water,
provisions and all the necessaries of
life will be right at hand. I learned
to understand and appreciate LJge Har
ris during the strenuous times locating
the mines. I had long talks with him
In the mysterious evenings, when great
bunches of stars looked out of the blue
Ekies. He is the original owner and
tbe locator of the LJge Harris Bullfrog:
mine. This Is the mine that has just
made a big strike and which was re
ported by the Associated Press within
the last few days. At this place, at a
depth of sixty feet, they have struck
. paying ore. He is also the locator and
owner of the original, Bullfrog Exten
sion. This is one of the richest prop
erties in Southern Nevada. It would
take too long to give a list of his prop
erties and his travels, but it is safe to
*ay that every one In the mining
camps knows Lige, and he is identified
by his beautiful team of black horses.
His travels over the desert would fill
a book, and not a small one at that. . He
knows the country as well as tbe aver
age San Franciscan knows the city
streets. - . .
I have returned to San Francisco, and
mentioning my experiences to a number
Kit moneyed people, I was advised to
form a company and take out of the
ground, whtit there" is waiting there
for us.
Tnis is my simple statement and it is
cii.de with the view/of interesting peo
ple in a company which is now. formed
und Incorporated, with Lige Harris as
president. There will only be a limited
number of shares sold, just enough to
cover the expenses of starting-develop
ing- the property. We have an of
fice and it is located at 124 Sansome
etreÂ«t and Is known as the Furnace
Creek Gold Mining Company. Onr as
e?ys reached from $111 to $518 to the
ton. These were not picked samples;
but taken at random from each of the
claims on the surface. It is in these
mountains that the famous ; mine : from

STOCK MARKET
IS UNSTEADY
Moderate Buying Movement
Calls Out a Free Offering
of Leading Securities
COPPER SHARES LOWER
Operations Are on a Light
Scale and Are Mostly of
a Professional Character
NEW YORK. Sept. 2.-Any detailed and
extended recital of to-day's brief session
of the stock market would be profitless.
It -had all the familiar ante-holiday
symptoms, . superinduced by more than a
week of liquidation of profit-taking. Op
erations were on a very light scale and of
professional character, the hesitating tone
of the list reflecting the uncertainty pre
vailing on the board. A moderate buying
movement in some of the active issues
met with free offerings of stocks, and
prices receded.
The market came almost to a stand
still on the issuance of the bank state
ment, which showed a further decrease
of reserves. The loan decrease of about
57,700,000 was regarded as but a partial
reflection of the week's liquidation, but
the statement as a whole i was received
with satisfaction and helped to produce
the flrm closing.
Total sales of bonds, par value, $1,245,
000.
The momentary spurt on Tuesday was
but a Hash In the pan and represented
scarcely more than belated buying by
those who seemed to expect that an im
mediate and further rise would follow the
conclusion of peace. It also gave the.
professional element and its followers an
opportunity of which they had partly
availed themselves a few days before.
They "sold on the good news," thereby
showing strict observance of a tradition
almost as old as Wall street. This move
ment was followed by the appearance of
the "tight money bogey," which brought
lower prices all around and gave the
market the most serious setback it has
known since the June advance.
The week was prolific of many Russian
and Japanese loan rumors, none of which
took tangible form and many of which
have since been denied. That both coun
tries will need money for rehabilitation
and development is well known, but for
the present the subject is dismissed with
the assurance of a high authority that
Japan will hardly come into the market
this year, while Russia's needs are most
likely to be financed abroad.
One of the greatest movements in cop
per metal, and incidentally in the copper
shares, met with a reversal during the
week. This was partly the result of the
ending of the war in l,he Far East,
whence have come the heaviest demands
for the past year.
Many who have watched the operations
of the banks in their relations to the
stock market profess to see in the rumors
of a possible money stringency something
more than a mere phantom. They point
to the low reserves, less than one-fifth of
those of a year ago and many millions
below those of 1903, and to a loan account
expanded far beyond \u25a0\u25a0 ordinary propor
tions. ;
United States 3' s, coupon, advanced %
and the old 4's \% perc ent during the
week. 'â¢\u25a0\u25a0 ;; ; . . \u25a0

To old patrons of Tortoni's and epi

ant surroundings, it will be welcome
news that S. Constantini will again ca
ter to their wants at the Spreckels Rot
lsserie. For fourteen years llr. Constan
tini. has been prominently identified as
one ot the leading restaurateurs of
San Francisco, and his connection with
the Cafe on the eighteenth floor of the
Claus Spreckels building will tena
greatly to popularize this well-known
restaurant.
It is the intention of the management
to close., the place for a short period,
during- which time it will be renovated
and furnished in a most artistic and up
to-date manner. Silverware from the
best American manufacturers, imported
glass and table ware, wilt add much to
the pleasure of those who dine, and
Constantini's reputation guarantees the

OAKLAND, Sept. X. â There was a
cutting and pruning- of estimates sub

for the next year's expenses at a meet

morning and a disposition shown to
do something real nasty with these ac
counts. The recent disclosures in re
(?a.rd to the stuffing of the stationery
accounts has nettled the members and
.there was nothing: that Just suited them
in thÂ« way of estimates submitted to
day.
i ThÂ« meeting: was called for the pur
poee of getting an idea of what it
would cost to run the offices In order
to fix the tax rate for the coming year.

others wÂ«re too high. The Treasurer's
.estimate was returned. He had not
footed up his estimate because he did
not know the cost of certain books that
fee would have to have. The Recorder's
estimate was not in the form that was
desired and was returned.
Then Assessor Dal ton's estimate was
taken up and he wanted $1600 for sta
tionery. After his bill for the past six
months just having been cut J4SO, this
item brought forth an outburst, and
Supervisor Howe declared he would not
vote for a cent more than $500, in which
Talcott concurred. Dalton's estimate for
hiB office was $6700, besides which plat
books, which would cost $8000, and
other books of record vrould have to be
â¢supplied him. The Supervisors djd not
understand how Dalton needed $1600
for stationery when the County Clerk,
who furnishes twelve departments, only
asked for $2400.
County Clerk Cook also stated that
"after this he Intended making each
office stand its own stamp bllL Here
tofore he had bought the stamps for
All the county offices and thus his totals
.-were much greater than they really
represented. The upshot of the matter
â¢was that the entire matter was put
over until next Tuesday morning, when
the board will again take up this ques
tion and allow what it believes to be
the minimum at which the offices can
be conducted for.
JUDGES DISAGREE
OX DESERTION LAW
Alameda Court Gives De
cision Different to That
of This ' City. '
OAKLJVJTD. Sept. 2. â The case of
Minnie Tlnsley against her husband,
James S. Tlnsley, for maintenance, was
h^ard this morning. She drove Tinsley
out of the house by filling It with peo
ple gathered for the purpose of spir
itualistic studies, and be had only been
absent two weeks when she brought
an action for $50 a month maintenance.
Attorney M. C. Chapman, on behalf of
the husband, demurred, and he was
sustained. L,erÂ«.ve to amend was denied.
In explaining hi* point. Chapman
said: "The way the law now stands
the wife must have been deserted be
fore she can sue for maintenance. This
means leftÂ«-for one year or more. Un
der the old law she could sue If her
husband had only left her for a week."
The same point was made by George
D. Collins before Judge Graham in San
Francisco, who decided that it was the
intent of the last Legislature to
broaden the law relating to desertion,
and he decided against Collins. The
point, however, was made here before
Judge Ellsworth yesterday and Judge
Graham's decision Quoted to him, but
he said that he would have, to ,be gov-,
erned by the language of the â¢ statute,'
and this morning's . case was decided
by Judge Melvln in the same manner.

SAYS WITNESS
TOLD UNTRUTHS
Charles W. Sullivan Asserts
Miss Grau Gave False Tes
timony at the Inquest
HUSBAND MAKES REPLY
Declares Woman Has Placed
Him in Bad Light in Ef
fort to Wreak Revenge
OAKLAND, Sept. 2.â Charles W. Sul
livan, the husband of Mrs. Carmen B.
Sullivan, who committed suicide by
drinking lysol at their, home at 681
Forty-sixth street,: last Sunday, replied
to-day to the charges made by Mies
Jeanette Grau of 1267 O'Farrell street, j
San Francisco, in her testimony at the
Coroner's inquest, that he had driven
his wife to suicide by abuse and ill
treatment. Sullivan declares that Miss
Grau deliberately made false state
ments In her testimony,- hoping by this
means to be revenged upon him be
cauee he had refused to allow his wife
to associate with her after their > mar
riage.
In his reply to the charges made by
Mies Grau at the Inquest Sullivan said
to-day: . . - â¢-
"Miss Grau's statement that I struck
my wife or in any way abused her
before she took the fatal â¢ draught is
absolutely false and Is made with the
intent to injure me. She took, this
metftod of revenge because of her hatred
of me, because I had prevented my
wife . from keeping company with her.
I knew her before my marriage and
knew that she was not a fit compan
ion for Carmen, on account of, her hab
its. ;\u25a0 ; :v;,;
"Her testimony that I came home in
toxicated on Saturday night Is a lie,
for I' had had but two drinks during
the entire evening. While I was 'away
from the house, on the morning that
Carmen took poison Miss Grau tried to
Induce my wife to leave home -and go
to the country "with her, but she "did
not succeed in -her attempt to get Car
men to desert . me. \u25a0. t \u25a0
"This woman knew . that I objected
to my. wife being in" her company and
this was her reason for trying Ito place
me In a" bad light at the Coroner's In
quest. Through her false testimony
she has caused : me to be misjudged
and made me to appear responsible for
the death of my wife."
TRUSTEE IS OPPOSED
TO "EACE SUICIDE"
Alameda Official Says Every
Policeman Should Have
a Family.
. ALAMEDA, Sept 2. â "Race suicide"
is . the argument City Trustee Frltx
Boehmer uses in urging the Increasing
of the salary of the Alameda .patrolmen.
At the committee meeting of tho Trus
tees last night. In speaking on the
proposition of increasing their pay, Mr.
Boehmer said:
- "I do not think a man can support a
family on $80 per month, and every po
liceman ought to. have a family."
Alameda' s patrolmen are paid but $80
per month and her police sergeants re
ceive but $90. The proposed Increase
is W0 per month" all around, and all the
Trustees expressed themselves as in fa
vor of it last night.
The Trustees upheld City Electrician
Kahn*last night in the -retirement of
Chief Engln-eer' Messer and the sum
mary-dismissal of J. Robinson, a fire
man at the plant. .The causes assigned
\u25a0were held to. \u25a0â¢ be- sufficientâ lack of

ter war is on between the white miners
and the Chinese panners and rockers
employed;. by the Oroville Dredging
Company, of .California irt the operation
of the half-score prospecting machines
operated on the dredging fields of "Wal
do, near Grants ' Pass. . It : has been the
Ironclad rule, .'since ;tiie.l early days, to
allow no Chinese to .work in the gold
fields of Josephine 'County, and It Am
the" enforcement^ of this rule. that has
brought about the present trouble. j In
many instances the white* miners have
descended upon' the' machines and driven
the Orientals to route with clubs and
guns, and only the , refusal ";of vthe Chi
nese to meet the miners in open com'
bat, has prevented bloodshed. ~

great reclamation "district, . in further
ance of the ; plan of reclamation framed
at Sioux City. lowa., by eminent en
gineers employed f.or the purpose by, the

The report of the engineers showed
there are some 1250. square miles of fer
tile land subject to overflow during pe-'
riods of floods. The '; total; estimated
cost of the work is nearly 524,000,000,
to be borne by the land-owners and -the

When the Day's Play Is Over
Only Nine Out of Twenty-
Six Players Survive Day
SLOW WORK PEEVAILS
\u2666
Sinsabaugh Fails to. Uphold
the Honor of the South,
Losing to George Janes
The opening day's play of the annual
coast championship teams' tournaments
at San Rafael yesterday was productive
of tennis both good and bad. The pre
liminary and first rounds were run off,
and as a result the poorer players were
weeded out of the competition. The
weather was unusually mild and the
contestants were able to play to form.
A fair sized gallery witnessed the vari
ous contests, sorae of which were close
and exciting.
OX the twenty-six players entered but
nine remained at the call of time Just
before dark. Seven players reached the
second round, while the eighth place
ivill go to either Carl Gardner or Harry
liolfe. One set was played and went to
Gardner by a score of 6-3. The Beven
other successful players are Reuben
Hunt. George Janes. Morris McLough,
lin. Clarence Gri3n. Harold Braly, Fred
Adams and B. F. Xourse.
The usual opening day surprises were
lacking, everything going off as ex
pected. Two of the three intrants from
the south were defeated, Braly being
the only one to survive the day's play.
Sir.sabaugh did not play his best game
aya:r.Kt George Janes and the latter took
him into camp handily. Sinsabaugh's
defeat was encompassed by his neat
service, which he essayed to follow in.
Janes drove past his opponent time and
time again, and early in the third set
had the match well in hand.
Great things were expected of Reu
ben Hunt, but he did nothing startling.
His only match was with George Busch,
who recently won the championship of
the Northwest at Portland. Busch look
tÂ«l all over a winner until the end,
when Hunt seemed to strike his gait.
Busch played as well as he knew how,
while Hunt appeared nervous and by no
mÂ«?ans sure of himself.
Carl Gardner and Claude Wayne play
ed an exciting match in the preliminary
round. They were as evenly matched
as two players could be, and the out
come was in doubt to the end. Gardner
won by the narrowest of margins.
Adams. Braly and Griffin all reached
the second round without difficulty.
Braly grot off badly In his match with
Herbert Schmidt, but won the second
set without the loss of a game. Twice
in the first set Schmidt needed but one
point to win. - - *
Adams . disposed of Nicholson in
straight sets. . \u25a0
On Monday the following matches
will be played in the second round:
Hunt vs. Janes; McLoughlin vs. Gardner
or Rolfe; Griffin vs. Braly; Adams vs.
Nourse. The tournament will be com
pleted to the finals.
The consolation doubles tournament
for those beaten In their first match ac

.^lf the ; Siwashes "had ; bean able to
make a t ew r more of their hits' count at
Recreation Park yesterday '"'-they/ might
have taken a fallout of tho Seals. It
seemed : a terrible task for them to ad
vance a man ' after he had managed to
reach the first bag. The base runners
invariably stuck there or were retired
on the " double j play route, so I the /eight
hits made off Busher Henley < gathered
but two runs. ,v, v r -
;.- On .the- other hand, the Seals were
the -lucky : kids with theirs. uThey only,
hammered' Hall ' for . four, that r looked
good, but these brought r home a ; flock
of .' runs. A couple ;of errors â¢{ did â¢ the
rest : and clever sacrificing and speedy
work . oh ; the "j sacks , helped out ' soml
also. The runs t were all, scored ;by;the
first four men at the bat and they all
came around the bases inrotatlon. "\u25a0 \u25a0
The - game was full of live and ex-"
citing, incidents. The feature was the
number of ; close , decisions which ,; went
against.Jthe - Siwashes. Three ' times
Houtz was apparently safe at the first
bag on infield hits, yet Davis; decided'
two of these plays against Â» him. Every
fan. in' the lot was ready to swear Kane
beat out his drive jto short in the las t
inning, 'but the ; indicator man did not
hesitate in calling .him out. - . .
KldMohler was the bestfmanof the
day" with the:; stick. /He was up three
times and twice %he landed on . the
leather Â« for \u25a0\u25a0 half Z. the route,"; the first
wallop; going out to deep left field and
the second ' one * traveling: far away " in!
the. direction- of ..the Scoreboard.' Up; to'

Muller â¢ : and â¢ Kane ii beat r out : Infield
scratches, 4ibut Â£ Blankenship became
angry - and produced a\, bunted .pop i fiy^
to Nealon. -This \u25a0;. resulted ' In < a double

COLM A CONTEST
IS ATTRACTIVE
Will Re Witnessed by More Spectators
, 3 hdn ''Any Queens berry Contest.
BRITT IS A SEVEN: TX) TEN FA VORITE
\ Seats - were placed on . public \u25a0 sale at 30
O"Farrell street yesterday: for the ' Britt-
Nelson '-. fight ,; at Colma next Saturday.
The â¢ demand for the : coveted ' pasteboards
indicates that the largest crowd that ever
witnessed a Queenaberry .battle ' will Jour
ney to - San Mateo County on that occa
sion/-"'- '.'- \u0084 \u25a0' :\u25a0\u25a0.' : '.W--'
The accommodations in the reserved
sections were - Increased \u25a0 some days since,
and the intention of the management now
is to provide more seats on the bleachers.
These ', are -s the \u25a0' best Beats ' from which to
view \ the \u25a0 fight^ ; the only objection being
that they are "' noi 1 reserved. '/ This means
there will be a scramble for them on Sat
urday. There is ; a \u25a0 deep pitch to these
seats,' thus, giving. the occupants an unob-"
structed :,viewj of = the" ring/ ; As there" are'
nearly 6000 of these seats they will hold
all the; tight fans who ; cannot ; find ac
commodations in the reserved sections.
Nelson " is perturbed . and " stands by ; his
: statement ; that if he .Is \u25a0 not favorite ; the
day he 'tackles; Jimmy Britt in the^rlng
he will consider ] that something : is radi
cally wrong- , ' : -/
\u25a0;" "My reason for making that statement,
about ; the betting is simply this : I think
the public should:, make jme favorite.'
When we met before the great majority
left the? ringÃide saying that I should
have I knocked him o atjit the battle had
gone on for' a .couple; , of. 1 more rounds.;
The (next day i they were Â« all : in the mood
to make .me a decided favorite over him
in a fight to a finish. Now this is a finish
fight in everything but! name."
Nelson does not take Into consideration
the fact that It ]is * evident Brltt has im
proved '. in ? a marked -- degree ". since they,
fought â¢ before," while > the 4 Dane on : the
showing, he: made, in the East against
Att ell and : Sullivan " seems !to \ have gone
back. Nelson agreed upon" two ; men for
referee of the coming fight before Jeffries
was i finally selected. ; It would â¢ seem the
action has been ;so . swift ? in this matter
as to puzzle the : Dane : and he has ; not
caught up with the procession.
~l{ Since Nelson fought^Herreral at Butte
several t months ago ; and to give
the . Mexican ~ a return -match for some
reason thati is best : known -to; himself he
seems to look with suspicion on all fights.
Notwithstanding I Nelson's \ protests | he; is
still going \u25a0 down \u25a0 the line |in . the betting.
His price dropped a half point yesterday,
Brltt. closing ' a . strong -It to 10 ,! choice. ;i
Nelson continues':' his .hard boxing
work at Colma. i He takes an unneces
sary .:' amount ,= of : punishment ., from : . his
sparring partners. ? Although the gloves
are ten-ounce affairs, considerable pun-"
lshmentT can ; be Inflicted % withi them.
Nelson'takes many hard punches on the
Jaw, and, although is an Ironman,
these = must - tell on him in, timeJrfi It*
would 'seem ', he would' get better, results
if he \u25a0 had ' some â¢ light, : clever, boy, who
could * work -out -fast ?: with "him," but
would' cut \ out - all- the \u25a0 slugging. -Pun
ishment , never ? helped any fighter; in
training, but must take from him some
of ' hi 3 v, vitality. 1 Nelson* has > lost ;,the

, . Easily for One Day.
-With' the date for his "engagement at
Colma witlT Battling Nelson for su
premacy l in . the light-weight class but
\u25a0even i days distant, James Edward Brltt
lis I preparing to' put ;on the finishing
touches . out . at~ fiheehan's Villa on the
Ocean. Beach. :' -
: l. The two great light-weights signed to
go ] forty-five rounds. 5 and right now the
California' boy . looks fit and ready to
travel \u25a0 the ; route, or forty-five days, for
that matter. ; Hundreds have dally . vis
ited' Brltt at camp, where his work has
been patterned out by .the ever watoh
ful Spider Kelly, and It requires neither
physician's certificate nor microscopic
examination to convince " one that the
conqueror of young Corbett Is In the
pink of : health and condition. . .
There was breathing room. only in the
gymnasium' yesterday, and while Jimmy
went through with his daily routine hÂ«
did not: hammer any of his boxing
mates into; unrecognizable masses of
pulp or knock out any boards from the
side walls. In fact, he Jet them down
rather light. ~ln explanation Britt said
he was as light as he cared to be at
this stage of the game, and "Tlv" Krel
lng; chirped 'in with. "Yes. and you
don't want to leave any of your super
fluous strength hanging on the appara
tus .around here."
5 As Manager -Willis Britt is suffering
from, an increase of adipose tissue in the
region of the belt line which appears dif
ficult to subdue, he did not don the mitts
yesterday. Jimmy went three mild rounds
with Frank Rafael,/ in which [ Infighting
predominated. Johnny Frayne, the clever
amateur,";, next : pulled on tha gloves for
a j three-round " bout, giving . a < pretty ex
hibition. V The final two rounds of lugging,
blocking and ; boxing . between Brltt and
Krellng i evoked frequent bursts of ap
plauae from the crowd, ~ Britt displaying
mountains , of strength against his power
ful : adversary. â¢ In fact throughout his*
training this has; been a striking feature
of Jimmy's Iwork. Critics have harped on
the marvelous < strength of Nelson, when
It Is a bunch '.of , Portland sports *to a

Frayne \ entertained " a' big gathering with

- . Battling : Nelson -. ; from f - all . accounts
thinks ; the ; betting on , the : match should
be even money ) and 1 your. pick. Britt says
the gambling end of it bothers him but
little.' -i His contention Is that he was in
stalled favorite : because ; the Dane does
not ' impress j, visitors by i his work. .Then,
again," Nelson should remember that this
city is Britt's home. . and that all do not
coincide i with thÂ« Battler In his views of
their,; former contest.
: Billyh Nolan's .man has been quoted
as saying that he. had Britt all but
out, and ;. that the ;â¢ latter's seconds had
to ~ carry him to \ his corner ; at â¢ the ; end
of ; the sixteenth round. ;. The i Dane for-Â»
got ' to add, though,'Xthat ;aVdark lan
tern- would . have materially,' aided : him
in locating his own at the ter
mination: of this same round. There
is. no .denying that It was, a severe
round,': but Britt ! was In no ; need' of as

As Captain of Track Team
and Performer in Sprints
i He Has Work Enough to Do
BERKELEY*, Sept. 2.â -Somethlna; i
akin, to consternation spread In the)
ranks of - tha varsity football squad
to-day when It was seml-ofildally an- -
nounced that the . varsity team Is to* :
lose the services of Ollle Snedlsar, the -
crack halfback, who was a tower of
utrensth In * the fames laat year and
who was expected to shine as a bril
liant gridiron luminary this season. \u25a0
: Snedisar is In magnificent condition,
apparently, and seeming-ly ready to
Play the same of his life. He has not
put on a suit, however, during: all the
practice work under Coach K nib b a, and
be will not take part in any .of tha
football work. His decision Is final
Snedigar's action has mystified th*
â¢Quad 'and the student body In general,
as It Is almost without ' precedent to*
a football star who Is In chap*
physically to play the same to step
out of the squad. Bnedlsar's posltloa
on ; the .team was ao assured that his
mates find it hard to believe that he
has actually relinquished , the chanca
to be In the biff s&me as a star when
Stanford Is met on November 11.
The explanation Snedlsar slves, how*
ever, is simple. He declare* that, aa
captain sof the university track team
and as - a . performer. In .the 100-yard
dash, the 22 0-yard dash and the broad
Jump events, hs expect* to hold up his
end as ; a collese athlete, and that th*
heavy, rough \u25a0 work - a football half
back, soes through la likely to dull him
for track work next spring. That la
why he will eschew the honors andL
more sensational rewards of gridiron
combats for the glory ' that oomea to
the track team captain and performer.
Snedlsar Is rated as the best all- A^
around - athlete in the university. Ha
won the North gold' medal for this dis
tinction last year, having, competed
with brilliant success In the football
names and the track and field events
with Stanford. He. has been on the
.varsity football - team during two sea
sons.

CONTAGIOIJS
HLOOD POISON^
Contagious " Blood Poison more \u25a0 thor-
oughly poisons the blood than any other
disease. Every part of the body is af-
fected when the vims becomes intrenched .
in the circulation; red eruptions break
out on the skin, the mouth and throat
ulcerate, glands in 'the neck and groins
swell, the hair falls out, copper-colored
splotches appear on the body, etc. *
I waa afflicted with blood poison, and
the best doctors did me no good, though
I took their \ treatment faithfully. In
fact I seemed to get worse all the while.
I took almost every so-called blood rem-
edy, but they did not seem to reaoa th*
disease, and had no effect whatever. I
was disheartened, for it seemed that I
would never be cured. - At the advice ox
a friend I then took S. S. a. and be ran. to
improve. I continued the medioine, and
'^amfet^^^B. OTTOJJJT.
So highly contagious is this disease:
that many a life has beea ruined by â¢
friendly hand shake or from using tha
toilet articles of one affected with tha
poison. To cure this hideous and hate-
ful disease a constitutional remedy is re*
quired. . S. S. , S. goes down to the very
root of the trouble and forces out every
particle of the virus from . the blood ana
cures the disease permanently. , S. S. S.
is purely vegetable and drives out tha
_ trouble, rootand
S^^k Â£]^ branch, and no
aigus of it ara
ever geen again.
Those whohava
been cured by
PUHELY VEGETABLE. 6. aS. can feel
assured that
none of the poison is left in tha blood to
transmit to innocent offspring. The en-
tire body is built up and the blood made
pure, rich and healthy by this great rem-
edy. f Book \u25a0vfith instructions for home

The Incomparable WMte Steam Gar
Now on Exhibition at â
THE WHITE GARAGE, 1878 MARKET STREET
This car has a wide, comfortable $ide door. The. wheel base is 114 inches, and it has an entirely new
burner constructed so as to eliminate- the necessity for. side flues, together with;, other changes tending .to in^
creased efficiency and convenience of operation.": The rear. of the body is!so.siaped as to deflect dust. Under
the rear seat is a storage compartment of: ample proportions.. \u25a0 \u0084 â¢> / \u0084 . '
The base of the burner is without perforations, and-theonly air which. isadmittedis that which is mixed
with the gasoline vapor entering through the"^induction' tube. : The fire is thus i. *. absolutely -.{ 'protected/"' and it is
practically impossible for.it to be blown out, regardless Jdf the velocity, or direction of the .wind. â¢ The products
of combustion pass. upward between the coils arid instead of issuing through- side .flues, -as V. in former- models,
pass downward through an annular flue which surrounds the generator. . By the time ,the: gases have traveled
to the bottom of this flue they have given up practically all of their- heat, arid because of the liberal- dimensions
of the down flue, they are widely diffused and are dissipated in the open air without' their escape/being in any
way noticeable. This new arrangement also prevents any radiating heat being noticeable by the passengers in
the car. v ">,:..', ' : r : " ;,;'\u25a0â¢.;â¢; .," ; ; *â¢*/*"; \u25a0Â»;' ; . [.\u25a0"'\^-:- :^ 'â¢' ;-:;-..,-. V \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0;' '--.''^
Other new features of, the model: "F" are i the inside J-byerflpw 'fdr : the:Â« water ;tank, which '\u25a0/.readily' permits
of flushing and getting rid of accumulated oil in the"' water ta'nk-r-and compensating :brakes;.in which: a continu-
ous wire cable is substituted for brake rods, the arrangement-being such-as to insure under all- conditions an
equsl application of the brakes on both rear wheels. ; :
Note a Few Late Victories :
On July 4th, at Morris Park, New. York, Webb Jay, driving a 15 h.p. White steam car, broke the world's
tecord for a mile, reducing the figure to 48 3-5 seconds. . . .
At the 6ame meet the White won every race in? which it .was entered. . \ V. -.
It carried off the "Morris" cup. .- . ..;..,
Won the heavyweight championship of the' world by defeating the champion of France.
Won the "Diamond" cup and won the National Circuit Championship, making a record never approached
\u25a0by any make of car.
â¢ Webb Jay, with a White Steamer, had previously defeated Barney Oldfield, at Chicago, June 30th, and
has not only beaten his records, but has defeated him a number of times on the track, leaving Jay and the White
Steamer the undisputed champion of the, world, and this against gasoline cars rated up to 120 h.p. . :
The White won the $10,000 cup at the Chicago Automobile meet, June 30/1905, and carried off all the
honors of that meet. \u25a0 :'. v
The White car on the Pacific Coast has won over thirty cups in important racing events, which is more
than all other cys combined of its class, and in "many" of these races cars claiming twice to three times the horse-
power and selling for a great deal more money were among the "also ran." '' , â¢ '\u25a0 . '
The White car defeated all American cars in the Eagle Rock hill-climbing contest. # Â»
It won first and second place in the endurance run from Chicago to St. Paul on July Ist, 1905/ one
White csr starting 24 hours behind and finishing 12 hours ahead of all other contestants, including many gaso-',
line cars of higher price and claiming greater power. " â¢'
The White car holds the record between San Francisco and Los Angeles, having beaten all other cars of
a:l makes, regardless of price, nearly four hours. . .\
More White cars secured perfect certificates in the Glidden Tour than that of any other two makes com-
bir.ed. There were seven White cars secured certificates, and only two of any other make.
h'was originally intended that this new car should list at $3500, as there is nothing on the market sell-,
ing at that price that is equal to it in appearance or. efficiency. The price of $2800,' 3 f. < !o.'b. f the/factory, it has
been decided, will give a fair manufacturer's margin, owing to our being the largest : "."manufacturers of. touring
cars in the world, and we deem it best to conform to that principle, which has always governed our business,
and put this car out at a small manufacturing profit and depend upon largely increased volume of business
rather than upon excessive list prices and small volume, such as has been the rule of most manufacturers J of
\u25a0lUtOinobilcS. * â¢'-;-\u25a0 : | j-jjkjj . ../;: -' -..",... ././'\u25a0\u25a0'
That the 1906 White is the most desirable and capable automobile ever built, regardless of price, will not
be disputed by those who uoquire a knowledge of its capabilities and construction.
If you corilemp'ate baying an Automobile, you can't afford to purchase
without knowing why more buyers prefer the White than any other make *
cf touring car in the word. We take pleasure in answering questions. ' '

OBSOLETE RULE
IS GIVEN LIFE
A. service Is announced at -the Church
of the Advent which -Is unique in the
Episcopal denomination, inasmuch as it
Is almost without' precedent. The Advent
church is extremely ritualistic and prides
itself upon its catholicity/following many
of the practices and! doctrines which have
been obsolete in the Anglican communion
for over four .centuries. While the saints
in the calendar have certain days which
are commemorative and observed by j all
members with, prayer arid praise, the cus?
torn.of the 'Koman. church of adopting a
"patron" from ; among them is not" fol
lowed to any, extent. The Church of . the
Advent is the' first on the Pacific Coast
to revive a custom -which has tradition
and ancient custom to justify it. This
church has ranged itself under the ban
ner of St. John the Baptist, the forerun
ner of the , Christ, and henceforth will
consider itself under the special protec
tion of this saint. Supplications will be
made for his favor and a special day ap
pointed in his .special, honor, j To-day-be
ing, the "Feast of, St.; John the Baptist,'.'
the services will, be devoted to a contem
plation of the" life and martyrdom of one
of . the greatest minds in biblical history.
Rev, Charles N. Lathrop will preach lon
this theme, and a' musical service will' be

Bishop's consent has , been i! asked, V : and

Carried Out in the State
It was announced to the joint 9th of
September committee ' of the Native Sons
arthe meeting in ! Native Sons' Hall last
night that; there will be at i least 50.000
people in the capital city on the occasion
of the celebration of Admission day: It
was also stated that : plans for the -big
parade are practically complete, and the
line of March | was announced by Grand
Marshal Skelton as follows:" Forming at
Fourth and M streets, . the parade will
proceed along I the latter thoroughfare to
Tenth street, to X street, \to Second
street, to J street, to Sixteenth street,
from where the parade will counter
march, disbanding at Tenth and J streets.
A feature of the procession will be the
presence of State, county and city offi
cials, guarded -by twenty-four uniformed
members of the San Francisco"; police
force who belong to the order. \u25a0- j
' The decorations at the State capital will
be unusually elaborate, especially \u25a0 the
electric street \u25a0 illuminations. There will
be thousands of, lights along J and X
streets, as well jas- an electric emblem at
each corner "and an electric bower at
Eighth and X streets..'
:The electrical decorations at the Capitol
will-be on a grand scale. The building
itself, even to the top of the dome, has
been outlined in colored incandescents.
An electric arch has been erected at the
Tenth . and L streets entrance to the
grounds, and the trees In the front park
have been hung with colored electric
globes, resembling a grove of decorated
Christmas trees. On either side of the
roadway leading from the rear of the
Capitol to the Pavilion will be festooned
strings of electric lights.
A reception committee of fifty has been
selected from Sunset and Sacramento
parlors." It will meet incoming .- trains,
show brother members to their quarters
and tender them all possible services of
hospitality. .
The electric carnival parade. It is said,
will eclipse anything of the kind attempt
ed in the West aside .from- the- Mardi
Gras fetes at New Orleans, which it will
resemble to some extent. This parade
will contain numerous illuminated floats
symbolic of California life and scenes, as
well as other novelties. ,
The day parade will be in twelve sec
tions, each having a division marshal.
Mark Noon of Rincon Parlor. Peter J.

NAVAL COURT DETAILED TO TRY
COMMANDER LUCIEN YOUMG.
CAPTAIN WEST WILL B& JUDGE ADVOCATE
COiIMAN"DER AXD EUBORDIN'ATB OFFICER OF THE GUNBOAT BEXNIXGTON TO TRY WHOM ON A CHARGE OF NEGLECT
OF DUTY, IN CONNECTION WITH THE SAN' DIEGO CATASTROPHE, A NAVAL. COURT-MARTIAL, HAS BEEN DE
TAILED BY SECRETARY OF THE NAVY BONAPARTE.
Officer's friends Are
Denouncing General
Leonard Wood.
Special Dif natch to The Call.
WASHINGTON. Sept. 2.â Secretary
Bonaparte to-day issued jan order conven
ing a court-martial to meet at the Mare
Island navy yard on September 15 for the
trial of Commander Lucien Young and
Ensign Charles T. Wade on . charges
growing out of the fatal explosion on the
gunboat Bennlngton at San Diego in
. July.
The detail of the court is as follows:
Bear Admiral Henry Glass, Captain
Charles H. Perkine. Captain William P.
Day, Captain John E. Roller (retired).
Captain Frank H. Holmes (retired),
Commander Lewis S. Heilner, Command
er James H. Bull, Commander Edward
D. Under-wood, Commander William
Winder, Commander Stacy Potts, Com
mander Robert M. Doyle and Commander
Perry C. Gearing, all of the navy, with
Captain Ernest E. West of the . marine ;
corps as judge advocate.
It is reported here that the Concord, at
the Mare Island yard, will be placed in
commission on September 16 and take the
place of the Bennington on the Pacific
squadron. The guns of the . Bennington
\u25a0will be transferred to the Concord, whose
six-Inch armament is still in a factory
in the East. Commander C. T. Boush
will command the Concord.
The story that Secretary Bonaparte's
order directing that Commander Young
be tried by court-martial was procured
through an Intrigue carried on by Major
General Leonard Wood is being circu
lated here by a . number of the com
mander's friends. Their theory is that
General Wood made the suggestion as to
what ought to be done with Young, which
in turn was sent along to Secretary
Bonaparte.
These friends are doing what they can
to get facts to support their theory as to
why Young Is to be court-martialed. The
fact is. they allege that Wood considers
himself bound to get evrn with: Young
for testimony given by the naval officer
during the inquiry Into the Havana Jai
Alai Club scandal, which was made by
â¢the Senate committee while Wood's nom
ination to be major general was being
hHd up.
The commander's testimony, in effect,
was that everybody in Havana knew that
the Jai Alai Club, to which the general
had granted a permit, was a gambling ln
Â«2itution. and that the presentation of a
silver service by the club to the general
was. to say the least, a questionable
transaction.
Young's testimony was attributed to a
quarrel between Mrs. Wood and Mrs.
Young.

Officials . Delay Deportation
of Young Irishman Who
. Is Victim of Tuberculosis
. NEW YORK. Sept. 2.â The machinery -
of 'the- immigration law "at this port has
been stopped in the case of a young Irish
man .who had been ordered . sent back to
his island home' because he la suffering
from \ tuberculosis. -This . unusual ' pro
j cedure taken* so that thÂ«",, man's
; brother. - en v v : route ;^from Indianapolis.
j might see him for: the first" and "probably
llast'time. '._'.*/ '.;X"
.Patrick Kllroy. a, well-to-do old Irish
man," who. for nearly a quarter of a cen
tury, had . made his home in North. Salem.
i Ind.. decided a few weeks ago that the
climate of Indiana was the .thing to re
store the health .of his . son Thomas,
whomi â¢ he left in Ireland when he came
to the United States in thÂ« early .'ars. Ac
cordingly ha sent - a check to his son to
cover* the young man's \u25a0 expenses ' across
the ocean.' .He also wrote 'that Thomas
; would be, met at the" Indianapolis station
j by; N his - brothers , and â¢ sisters, several or
; whom he had never seen. â .
'\u25a0'. Young Kilroy . arrived in Now York last
Sunday ; morning . on the Celtic. Tha ma- .
rine hospital .doctors \u0084 who .boarded the
Celtic * at : quarantine "f" f soon took notice of
his .condition and; he was ordered /deport
ed, according to law; on the, first available
ship of "the line which brought him in.
This happened to be thoCeltic. Thursday
afternoon Kilroy was ordered to prepare,
for , the â¢ voyage ; Friday mornlns. A few "
minutes later a telegram - arrived from
Kllroy's brother, who said that although
he was coming East on the fastest train
he could get he would be unable to reach
New. York until fifteen < minutes after tha
Celtic c sailed.'. .
{^In-a^broken^voice .Thomas pleaded with
the j inspectors that â¢he be allowed to re-^
main until -.the next sailing. They wer I **
much Vaffected by the unusual nature of
the -case and -telephoned the ; steamship
company's officials. The latter i agreed to
foot the bill, " and Kilroy was ; allowed to
remain Â« behind " a " few days. His ' brother
arrived at Ellis Island Friday.

Future Grain and Provisions).
CHICAGO, Sept. 2.â The wheat market was
firm the entire session. At the opening the
December delivery was a shade to %c higher
at Sl%c to 81%Â«j81%c. Throughout the spring
wheat belt additional rain had fallen during
tho night. This fact largely accounted for the
firm undertone that prevailed in the pit. 5 1 In
addition some apprehension , was caused by. law
temperatures throughout - the ; Canadian" Norths
west. Much wheat in. .that Â«ection was re
ported as istill in a condition liable - to-cons
iderable Hamate by frost. " \u25a0 Another bullish
factor was a report from an English crop
statistician telling of fair \u25a0 inquiry forAmeri-i
can wheat. Demand was moderately s active
the entire day, but offerings were light. Late
in the session the' market galnfed" fresh strength
from an announcement > that: Buffalo millers
were buying hard â¢\u25a0 wheat \u25a0 here. Covering â¢by
ehorts carried the price of December up to
*>l%eSl%c Tie market closed firm with De
cember %c up at Sl%Â®Bl%c. \u25a0:â¢'
Threatened frost for the more northerly sec
tion of the corn belt caused a firm tone In the
corn market: December closed %c up at 43% c
Oats held steady. December closed up; %o
A five-cent decline in /the, price of live hogs
had a weakening influence on the provisions
market early in the session. Later a fair de
mand from \u25a0 Ehorts caused a steadier tone. At
the close October pork was up sc, lard was off

I The weekly report of Scott & Magner says:
The market ! throughout ' has been rather, un-
Jnteresting; no : particular.* features'- have de
veloped -to cause any 5 ehaogtr either t one *! way
or the other. . Prices \u25a0 nave remained - fairly
steady. - The - best grades of Hay command full
figures and sell readily, why e the medium anl
particularly the poorer gr.fcea â¢ find ' slow - sale,'
even at the exceedingly low- figures that arÂ«
quoted.' : ..... ..*:...Â»-.,'.,,â¢.,.!â¢>Â»..
On account of the settlement of. the war in*
the; far East it is expected by some that con
siderably Hay will be wanted shortly.; If such
feature develops 1 1 wil 1 i>e most welcome . and
tend to relieve' the strain on . this ; market. '
Alfalfa Hay .'continues ;.to, arrive', in: 'large
quantities under a steady, market, and', as a
great, deal of the Alfalfa that is coming | has
been engaged before arrival and is hot 1 thrown,
on the market for sale, good alfalfa is bring-;
ing $8 50 to. $9 and In ; some Instances . strictly
fancy, commands $9 50 per ton. \u25a0 The ; poorer of
ferings appear i neglected and dull. â¢':. ' .
.There has not been as much straw arriving
this week as heretofore. However, there has
been plenty to supply the small demand there
has been for this article. Large quantities of
Straw are being offered -to the dealers here at
low figures, but on account of the light de
mand I there is not ! much inducement . to - en
