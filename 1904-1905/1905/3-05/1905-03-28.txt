Higher Court

â â t\A< ITV IN FF.AITP THAT WRJSCKED AN OHIO BANK.
CLEVELAND. Ohio. March 27.âUn
less the higher court interferes Mrs.
Cassie L. Chadwick will spend the
srreat^r part of- the next ten years in
the Ohio State Penitentiary- A sen
tence of ten years was imposed upon
her by Judge Robert W. Tayler in the ;
United States District Court to-day. |
Mrs. Chadwick was convicted on I
eeven counts and 'sentenced upon six
counts. For four of these counts-. a
sentence of two years each was im
posed. Upon two counts a sentence of
one year each was imposed, making a
total sentence of ten years.
As soon as the sentence was pro
nounced Attorney J. P. Dawley, at
torney for Mrs. Chadwick. took ex- I
ceptions upon each count, except the j
first. The defense intends to make the
claim that the court cannot Impose a
separate sentence for each count; that
the law applied to the general charge
instead of each incident of a general
charge. The various counts of the in
dict/nent are considered by the defense
to refer only to details of the general
offense. This point will toe contested in
the higher court, as will the other
points of the Chadwick trial which re
sulted in her conviction. . ,
Either Judge Francis J. Wing or
Lawyer -Dawley -will- go to Cincinnati
to-morrow to make arrangements for
a review of the case' by the United
States Circuit Court of Appeals. The
first step taken by the defense will be
to ask for a stay of . sejnience. until .the.
appeal is tried out. There was an un
derstanding with United -States- - Mar
shal Chandler, United States Attorney
Sullivan and the court to-day to' the
effect that there would be no attempt
to execute the sentence until . the de
fense shallhave had an opportunity, to
carry the case to he higher court and
there obtain a suspension â¢ of the -sen
tence. Mrs: Chad wick will be defended
to the last court. '
No action will- be taken by United
States Attorney Sullivan regarding the
other : six indictments , against : Mrs.
Chad wick in the Federal Court until
the present case is 'â¢- finally disposed of.
If the present , trial and sentence be
sustained by the last court; the other
cases will be dropped; otherwise they
Â«ill be used against' the woman. -V~
Mrs. Chad wick . was ' not : particularly

GREAT CROTON
DAM IN DANGER
NEW YORK, March 2Sâ Conditions
brought about by the unprecedented
floods throughout the vas; watershed
whtch feeds the new Croton reservoir
are menacing the new $5,000,000 Cretan
dam. ,
The engineers in charge of the wc-rk
reiieved the danger so formidable last
i;ipht that watchers were detailed to
patrol the dam and give immediate
warning in case of Imminent peril. The
village of Croton Landing, v. ith a pop
ulation of about 100, is a mile below the
, new dam and directly in the path of
1 the flood should the dam break.
In ar. effort to employ all possible
, means to cope with the emergency, all
workmen who could be engaged were
rushed to the new dam last night and
set to work reinforcing the structure
at points where it was thought the
greatest danger lay.

Sbertal- Dispatch to Th* Call
NEW YORK. March 27.â The direc
tors of the Chicago, Milwaukee and
St. Paul Railroad are planning an ex
tension of the company's line to the
Pacific Coast. The final decision on
this important enterprise will be
reached within two months..
The construction work of an exten
siozi such as is proposed would Involve
the building of 1500 miles of track.
About $100,000,000 would be expended.
The wÂ»>: k probably would begin at
Evarts. S. D., on the east side of the
Missouri River. Going west, all of the
principal tonnage-developing centers
would be touched and some new ter
ritory would be opened up. St. Paul
engineers have found a route through
the mountains of considerable lower
grade average than that of the Great
Northern or the Northern Pacific. The
Western terminus would be at Seattle.
The question of whether construc
tion would be financed with bonds or
stock has not been decided. It is cer
tain that $25,000,000 unissued stock in
the treasury will not be used, but will
be employed In time to reimburse the
company for improvements already
amounting to $16,000,000.

l on to serve fourteen ' years for robbery
committed in ; this city. . -
The . announcement of the names of
the suspected men was made in Oak
land : yesterday. The men have been
under suspicion ever, since the robbery
was committed and officers have been
working unceasingly on the clews that
connected them with the crime. The
evidence against them is of such a
nature as to leave no doubts in th â¢
minds of the police that Zimmerman
and Collins â¢ are the men wanted.

CLEWS AT RICHMOND.
. Four x days ago the Pinkerton agency
i in. this city, which says it was working
\on information derived from a clew
first supplied by Sheriff ' Veale of Con-
I tra Costa County.- informed Captain of
Detectives Burnett of this city that
Collins and Zimmerman were the men
who had committed the crime at StÂ«?ge.
Captain Burnett at once detailed; four
: men from his office -to search for the
! pair, and the hunt for them has been
going on unceasingly' ever since. Ala
, meda County detectives and sheriffs
have also been busy In the chase.
i Either the-- two ex-convicts have de
, parted . many miles from the . scene of
> their crime, or they are well hidden,
for no trace of them has been found.
'It was at Richmond that, the clews
connecting Zimmerman and . Collins
with the > crime were obtained. The
men had been hanging around that
town for some time. â¢ It was learned
/rom several; people that they had a
| plan to get the money that the Oak
land bank sent to the one- at Rich
! mond. They even approached several
persons whom they : thought would
embark in such a \ dubious, enterprise
to assist them in the robbery. -One of
these. It is said, was Henry. His story,
so it > is ..alleged, is"; that the two men
| approached . him last October and "laitl
the plan "- before him. He : agreed to _
. help out. but the execution -of , the r
scheme was delayed from time â to
time i 1i 1 until he found â â¢; himself in jail
on this side of the* bay. . These -delays

1.JK1.1l \i REWARDS OFFERED, '.'
Vii c President W. G. Palmanteer of
the Central Bank was in the Pinkerton
Agency. in this city last evening after ,
the news of the identity of the men *
who were wanted had become public,
and h<. paid the i>?.nk people, were sat
isfied tbat the two named were the j
ones who had committed the robbery.;
He said the bank would Rive a reward
of S-:,\Â¥> f.,r the arrestof the men. $1000
for their conviction and $1000 for the
recovery of the money. Though the j
Â«ifn< Â» r scem%d very dubious on this i
point, he is confident that the two rob
bers are -â¢ill in hiding at some' point
about the bay. If they are ii is thought
the offer of a -reward will serve to â .
bring them into the clutches of .the law.: ,
Mr. Palmanteer says that as much
as $30,000 has been sent through. Daly
to Richmond and that he himself had
taken as lanre sums there- It ,was
intended to send $16,000 over on the,
day of the robbery, but there was a
balance in the Richmond Bank that
made this unnecessary. : .. , ... Â!
-Zimmerman is known to the police- '
of this city as a holdup- man and
'rough burglar." He was -arrested
here only six weeks ago by Detectives
Jsraig and Bell because he had a quan- i
ttty .of cigars in his possession that ,
they thought he had not obtained j
honestly. He lived for a long time on j
Mission street, between Fourth arid
Fifth. In 1897 he served six months j
in the County Jail for stealing $240
from John Young, a baker on Mc- ;
Allister street. .In 1898 he was sent
to Folsom for five years for breaking ;
Into Plempke's store at Oak and De- :
visa dero "streets. He 'was discharged
In 1902 and in 1903 was arrested by:
Detectives Reynolds : and "Wren on a !
charge of robbing Mrs. Bridget
Hughes at 14 Gough street. He was
not convicted of this offense, but was
sentenced to serve six months for hav
ing burglars* tools- in his possession. I
HENRY DENIES COMPLICITY. '
Collins was formerly- a hackman in
this it: and had a stand at Ports
mouth Square. Together with John
H. Snyder he was arrested by Police
men Burke and Price in October, 1886.
for a criminal assault committed on
â  woman and was sentenced to serve
twenty-five years, in Folsom. i He was
paroled in December, 1900. and was
discharged in ' 1902. Fourteen days
later Zimmerman also gained his
Jibeny. 1
It was at Foleom that the two men j
became companions. Zimmerman was
first baker and Collins his assistant. '
They have been together most of the
time since their discharge â¢ and it:, is
but natural that they, should â¢ have
planned the Stege hold-up together, if
they committed it, as the officers Bay' :
they did. *~ <â ' ' "â  . â  -^ 'â  â â¢ -
When Henry was seen at the Broad- j
way prison last night he seemed un- j
willing to talk. He admitted < that he"
had lived in Richmond and N that many
officers from both sides of the bay had' '
been to see him in prison recently, but ( !
he denied that he had known Collins or
Zimmerman. When told that It had j
been suggested that he had confessed .
In order to secure leniency for himself. j
he said: "What can they do for me?
I'm 2...>ri for eight years and- ten
months in prison with all the credits I j
can get and I'll never live through the j
sentence with this coUgh I've' got. â  ij

i a. m. â The Official Gazette announces
l that General Kaulbars, commander of
j the Third Army, has been appointed
to the command of the Second Man-
I churian Army and that General Bat-
Jamoff has been appointed to the com
1 mand of the Third Army.
ST. PETERSBURG. March 28.â The
I impression prevalent in some military
''circles that the Japanese, having re
moved the possibility of the main army
in Manchuria assuming the initiative,
will now turn their attention to the
1 next objective of the war, Vladivostok,
j is strengthened by the press dispatch
from- Gunshu Pass announcing the
withdrawal of the Japanese from the
immediate front of the Russian army
for a distance of thirty-five miles south, j
; It is realized, of course, that this may
be merely a blind to cover flanking
i operations, but' it is not improbable
j that the Japanese, having cleared
Southern Manchuria of Russian troops
and secured a position whence expul
sion would be a long and difficult pro- |
cess, may be satisfied to hold the Tie
I Pass line without further extension of :
communication.
While the voice of the Emperor's ad- |
vistrs is for peace, if honorable terms |
are obtainable, the Government, as is ;
the part of wisdom, is going forward â 
with all provisions for the continuance j
of the war. ' Preparations are reported !
to be making for the mobilization of'!
five corps. It had been understood that ;
the Guards would be retained at St. I
Petersburg, but some of rhe officers of ,
this crack organization believe their
services have been requisitioned and
ait making preparations to that end.
There has been a recrudescence of re- >
ports of a change in the head of the
War Office. It was said last night in a
usually well-informed source that [
Lieutenant General Sakharoff would
leave very shortly and be succeeded by j
General Ridiger, now chief of the chan
cellory of the War Office. It also is â 
reported that General Polivanoff will
be appointed chief of the general staff.
Both Polivanoff and Ridiger are of the s
younger school of generals, but have
high repute as theoreticians and ad- ,
ministrators. General Ridiger is the J
author, of a number of textbooks on j
tactics.
The Government is advised that |
Chinese bandits are appearing in great j

ENGLISH OPTIMISM.
London Editor Sees Where Britain
Will Profit by the War.
LONDON, March 28.â The Daily Tel
egraph thts morning editorially returns
to the subject of peace negotiations and
of the common interests of Great Brit
ain, Japan and the United States in the
Far East. The newspaper thinks that
though such a triple alliance is emi
nently desirable, the Monroe doctrine
would prevent America allying her
self; but as far as Great Britain and
Japan are concerned there is nothing
to prevent a permanent offensive and
defensive alliance, which the Daily
Telegraph contends might even induce
Japan to forego indemnity, and which,
by placing at Great Britain's disposal
in India the service of Japan's fine
troops, would forever remove the ap
prehensions of Russian invasion of In
dia,
The Daily Telegraph further says
that such a treaty, which would date
from the conclusion of peace, would,
with the moral support of the United
1 States behind it, be a guarantee of the
preservation of peace in the Far East,
the open door in China and the devel
opment of trade for all nations in the
Orient.
VICTORY BRINGS CREDIT.
Even French Bankers Eager to Lend
Money to Japan.
NEW YORK, March 27. â Japans
new $150,000,000 loan probably will be
offered in this city on Wednesday. The
underwriting syndicate, which has now
been completed, will rank as the larg
est which has ever secured the flota
tion of a foreign loan in the United
States. There are altogether 300
members, representing prominent
financial interests of New York, Chi
cago and other large cities.
A remarkable incident was the re
ceipt of applications here from French
applicants. The amount of French
subscriptions to the American portion
of the loan received to-day could not
be definitely learned, but the bankers
united in saying that they were heavy.
No subscriptions had been awaited
from that quarter.
The life insurance companies will
take one-fifth of the New York portion
of the Issue, or $15,000,000.

warships Inferna and Kersaint and
which are said to have contained or
ders relative to the movements of the '
Russian second Pacific squadron, dis- '
appeared between Port Said and Jibu- I
til, French Somaliland. The investiga- ;
tions made have not resulted in finding
any trace of the missing bags and
Borne fears are entertained that they
may have reached those interested in

CUBAN TREATY IN ISSUE
Proclamation Postponing Its
Operations Ten Days
an Executive Mistake
NEW YORK, March 27.â A board of
United States General Appraisers an
nounced a decision to-day in which it
held that President Roosevelt pos
sessed no legal authority to postpone
for ten days the date when the Cu
ban reciprocity treaty took effect, as
heTdid in his proclamation of the treaty.
The case was brought by the Dalton
Company, which maintained that the
treaty took effect on March 1. when
the ratifications took place. That point
had already "been decided in the nega
tive, and the Board of Appraisers did
not pass upon it in to-day's decision.
The United States Senate, when it
ratified the treaty, inserted an amend
ment that it should not take effect
until approved by Congress. Congress
approved it on December 17 and the
President on that date issued his proc
lamation. He provided, however, that
the treaty should not take effect for
ten days.
Judge Somerville, who wrote the
opinion of the board, calls attention to
the fact that the first clause in the act
of Congress of December 17 provides
that the treaty "shall go into effect
when the President has received sat
isfactory evidence that it is the inten
tion of the republic of Cuba to give
full effect to the convention and issue
a proclamation accordingly."
Judge Somerville then says:
The proclamation itself, however, recite
that suoh evidence hai been received by thÂ«
President. Its language is: "And whereas,
Satisfactory evidence has been received by the
President of thÂ« United States that the repub
lic of Cuba has made provisions," etc. It is
difficult, therefore, to seÂ« why the convention
did not by ltÂ» very term* become immediately
operative. We know of no constitutional au
thority which would authorize the executive
to postpone ltÂ» operation a day after this time.
If he could defer its operation for ten days
there would seem no reason why he might not
do It for ten months. It would seem that h*
could no aiore postpone the operation of a
treaty, duly ratified, than he could that of &
statute duly enacted.
As a matter of fact, 'in the present instance,
it ' seems too clear for doubt 'that the action of
the. President Is attributable to thÂ« ambiguity
rf the . language of the - treaty itself, and the
confusion of the dates which occur In it, the
harmonUlngr.'of whic,^ has required the closest
frrutlny s.n.l stuily â th* flrst date for Its oper
ation being . that â¢ fixed by ' the 'diplomats who
negotiated it, .namely, fRVTenTh day after the
exchange ratification*, the second being that
fixed by the Senate, namely, the time when It
should receive Congressional approval, and a
third element of uncertainty being involved in
the language of the act of Congress, stating
that "the President la Tiereby authorized to
issue his proclamation . and thereupon, oa the
tenth day after exchange of ratifications." etc..
the treaty should become operative. .

to the Honci and Cans
Police Commissioner Thomas Reagan
is next in line for accusation by thÂ«
Grand Jury. According to present
plans, a presentment wtil be returned
: against him before the week Is over
charging him with misfeasance, it \a
alleged that in the primaries last Au
gust the Commissioner was & leading
political worker, an offense specifically
designated by the charter as cause for
removal of a member of the Board of
Police Commissioners.
The presentment will mean that thÂ«
District Attorney must proceed against
Reagan to remove him from office. Th*
evidence against the Commissioner is
said to be clinching. During the pri
mary campaign he had charges of th*
forces of the Horses and Carts organ
ization in the districts south of Market
street, and the prominent part he took
in that factional fight in the Demo
cratic party has been well known.
Reagan participated in this political
warfare because thÂ« Schmitz adminis
tration affiliated with the Horses and
Carts in the effort to wipe out the Mc-
Nab faction. The Commissioner owes
his position on the Police Board to hi*
work among the labor union men south
of Market street. He was at one time
president of the Street Pavers' Union.
The Grand Jury has been quietly
gathering evidence and the statement*
the witnesses have given are regarded
as strong. There can be no more de
moralizing factor In politics than a Po
lice Department in the control of un
scrupulous politicians, and nothing will
demoralize a police force more rapidly
than allowing it to engage in politics.
So say the grand Jurors, and they are
determined that an example shall bÂ©
made of Commissioner Reagan.
Investigation Is also being made, it ia
said, as to Commissioner Drinkhnuse'a
activites at elections.
TjORD SALISBURY GUII/TY
OF A TACTLESS MOvT!
Further Embarrasses the Balfonr
Ministry by HfsÂ» Tilt With
Chamberlain.
LONDON, March -'S. - PrÂ«tnl er Bal
four had a long conference yesterrtajr
with Lord Salisbury concerning the
latter's letter to the Times relative to
the late Lord Salisbury's attitude to
ward protection and Joseph Chamber
lain's fiscal policy, which latter has
caused a great sensation in the lobbies
of Parliament. It is understood that
Lord Salisbury wrote the letter with
out consulting the Premier and that
he, a member of the Government,
should so bluntly repudiate r*hamber
lain's policy and emphasize the strong
divergence of views in the Unionist
party on the fiscal question is con
sidered not only an indiscreet but a
tactless move which Chamberlain and
his party will be bound to resent.
A letter from Chamberlain in reply
to Lord Salisbury's communication ap
pears in the Times this morning, in
which, after expressing regret that
Lord Salisbury should think he had
misapprehended his father's views, he
proceeds to give extracts from speeches
delivered by the late Lord Salisbury
between 1892 and 1895, which Chamber

"It's true I took this gent's lid,"

wouldn't set 'em up, and just in fun I
took his dicer and| scooted with it,

William McConnell. alias "Billy the
Boxer." was perched atop of a tall
barber pole planted in a sidewalk at
Kearny and Jackson streets when Pa
trolman Nelson requested him to de
scend and in response was told to re
tire to a sultry region mentioned in
Scripture. Surrounding the pole was
a crowd that unanimously approved
Mr. McConnell's note of defiance and
the applausive cheers Impelled him to
say and do things which he might
have left unsaid and undone if he had
been sober. He slid down the pole
and nimbly "shinned" up again, sug-
, gestive of a toy monkey on a stick, and
then dangled his feet tauntingly within
the officer's reach, drawing them up
when they were grabbed at. A dila

Judge Mogan to the defendant, "but
you canted your^i"ke to a point of

SECRET CONSISTORY
Cardinals Receive Pontiff,
Who Refers to Persecution
of Roman Catholic Church
ROMK, March 27.â The Pope held a
j secret consistory this morning without
creating any Cardinals, merely pre
conlzing Bishops. The only American
was the Right Rev. Thomas F. Hickey,
who was eonnrmed as Coadjutor
| Bishop of Rochester, N. Y. Monsignor
Zobico Racciet was confirmed as aux
iliary Bish.ip of Montreal, Quehfc.
All the Cardinals met in the hall of
the consistory of the Vatican, where
they received the pontift. Ths Pope
then delivered an allocution and imme
diately afterward proceeded to the pre
conization of Bishops. The allocution
in moderate terms deplored the perse
! cuticn from which the church suffered
in some countries and complained of re
! cent events in France, where, besides
1 tne diplomatic rupture between the're
public and the papacy, the statesmen
are preparing for the separation of
church .'nd state, for which, the pontiff
asserted again, the Vatican was not
responsible, as has been alleged.
The Pope also referred to the perse
| cution of the church in some of the
I South American republics, especially
iin Nicaragua and Ecuador, citing the
laws passed by the last named repub
lic against the church providing for the
confiscation of the property of the re
ligious orders, interfering with the lib
erty of the religious associations and
putting obstacles in the way of the ap
pointment of new Bishops.
To offset this the pontiff mentioned
the fact that the arbitration between
Chile, and Peru had been entrusted to
the papal representative, whfch had
caused the Holy See much satisfaction.
Another passage of the allocution
says:
"Among other things, it grieves our
souls that the horrors of war are now
devastating the extreme East with fire,
blood and death. Oh, what tears are
shed there! Those who represent on
earth him who was the autnor of the
gospel of peace, we ardently beg may
receive from God inspiration to advise
princes and peoples to come to peace.
So many and so great are the evils that
aflliet the human race everywhere that
there is no need to have recourse to war
to make things worse."
The allocution ends with recalling the
recent jubilee of the Immaculate Con
ception and praying the Virgin to in
tercede for the joys of peace that are
so much desired.

BRITISH WRITER
Native Attempts the Murder
of Correspondent Harris
in the City of Tangier
LIFE SAVED BY WATCH
Assassin's Blade Deflected
and Inflicts Only Slight
Wound in the Stomach
TANGIER, Morocco, March 27.âWal
ter B. Harris, the correspondent of a
London newspaper, was attacked by a
native while in the British postoffice to
day. His assailant, a Moorish hotel
guicie, suddenly rushed upon him with
a knife, which, however, struck the
ring of Harris' watch and slightly
wounded him In the stomach. Harris
says he is not aware of any reason for
the attack.
Harris is the correspondent who was
captured by Moorish tribesmen near
Tangier in June, 1903, and was held in
C^tody by Raissouli, the brigand
chief, until some of Raissoull's follow
ers, who were in jail at Tangier, were
released by the authorities there.
PARIS, March 27.â The situation in
Morocco causes serious apprehensions
in official quarters, and it is understood
that the French Minister at Fez has
been requested to bring to a speedy
conclusion the negotiations whereby he
seeks to secure the Sultan's approval
of France's policy in administering the
country. In the meantime Emperor
William's proposed visit to Morocco
promises to cause the Sultan to delay
arriving at a decision and to encour
age a demonstration against the
French policy. There is a growing be
lief in high quarters that the German
Emperor's visit is coincident with Ger
many's asserting strong claims rela

the Cash With
Gratitude
Co ngregationalists
Remembered
Before.
John D. Rockefeller's donation to the
Congregational body was accepted and
has been disbursed in spite of the op
position, which materialized too late to
prevent the reception of the sum.
The gift was not tabooed by all in the
Congregational fold, and there were
men of influence among the flock who
were satisfied that the educational de
partments of the church should be en
riched.
Dr. Cornelius H. Patton, home secre
tary of the American Board of Com
missioners for Foreign Missions, who
is making a tour of the Pacific Coast,
is in San Francisco and said yesterday
regarding the matter:
The ultt of $100,000 by Mr. John G. Rocke
feller was not contributed to our regular ex
penses, but. was designated for certain of our
educational institutions in India, Japan and
Turkey for buildings and equipment. They
are institutions devoted to the training of na
tve converts for evangelistic and other forms
of Christian service.
It doee not help us on our regular appropria
tions, but is of very great value In improving
our educational plant.
I do not wish to criticize those who object
t.. .>ur receiving this money, aÂ« they are en
titled to their own opinions, which are un
doubtedly" given with the "utmost sincertiy.
All aspects of the matter were carefully con
sidered over a month ago by ouY prudential
committee at Boston when the money was first
offered, and the gift was unanimously ac
cepted with gratitude under a sense of its en
tire propriety.
This is not the first time Mr. Rockefeller has
contributed generously to Congregational in
stitutions. In recent years he has made hand
some donations to Oberlin University In Ohio;
to Mount Holyoke College, Mass , and to
Wellesl. y f'ollese near Boston.
It is, of course, known that Mr. Rocke
feller has contributed to the Baptist Foreign
Missionary Board something lfKe $200,000 a
year. Those who would have us refuse this
money would practically require us to take the
position of censors of these other institutions
and the whole Baptist demonlnation. of whioh
Mr. Roc-keff Her is a member in good and regu
lar standing.
The gift has already been appropriated to
the Institutions designated by Mr. Rockefeller.

TWO PRISONERS
ARE SENTENCED
Harry Radcliffe, Convicted
of Murder in the Second
Degree, to Serve 17 Years
GIRL WIFE HYSTERICAL
Ernest Moore Chadwkk Will
Spend the Xext Ten Years
in San Quentin tor Perjury
i
Harry Radcliffe was sentenced by
Judge Cook yesterday to serve seven
: teen years in San Quentin for murder
in the second degree and Ernest Moore
Chadwick, alias "Sir " Harry West
. wood Cooper, was sentenced to serve
, ten years on a charge of perjury. Both
; wives of the defendants were in court
and Radcliffe's girl wife went into
hysterics and was led out of the court
room by her sister and her mother-in
law.
Radcliffe shot and killed Andrew
Riley at Ninth and Sheridan streets on
the morning of June 26. He said Riley
had insulted his wife and during a
struggle Riley threw him down, and,
being afraid of his* life, he - fired
self-defense. The theory of the police
was that the defendant attempted to
hold up Riley and when Riley showed
fight he wat shot and killed.
Witnesses were called yesterday to
I testify as to the defendant's good char
1 acter. The Judge in passing sentence
said that he had to accept the verdict
! of the jury as far as acquittal on the
robbery theory was concerned. The
defendant's previous character had
been good and as' this was his first of
â¢ fense he would fix the punishment ac
cordingly. If the defendant's conduct
was good in the penitentiary he might
1 be paroled.
' j Chadwick was convicted of perjury
in falsely testifying in his own behalf
at his trial in Judge Lawlor's court in
1901 or. a charge of sending by tele
graph a' false and forged message pur
porting to be from another person. He
, had eloped in February. 1901, with
Xorine Schneider from Vallejo Junc
j tion .shortly after his release from San
i Quentin after serving a, term for utter
, ing and passing a fictitious draft in
1897. He represented to the girl and
â¢ her family that he was a physician of
wealth and induced her to become his
! wife by showing her telegrams purport
ing to have been sent by her mother,
1 consenting to their marriage. He was
errÂ«sted on the arrival of the train at
i 'Ogden. He was convicted on the
charge of sending the forged tele
' grams, but took an appeal to the Su
i preme Court and was granted a new
, trial. Meantime he had been tried and
. convicted by a jury in Judge Cook's
! court on the perjury cnarge, but sen
i tence was deferred pending the result
' ; of the appeal to the Supreme Court
on the forgery charge.
When sentence was to be passed
1 upon him Chadwick begged the Judge
[ to take into consideration the fact that
' I he had already spent four years and
! :â  two months in jail since his arrest in
Ogden and that there was no possi
bility of obtaining a parole. He did
not a<l'l that he had been married in
Oft County Jail.
' ! After sentence had been passed upon
j Cooper his attorney, Frank J. Alur
â  phy, said he was ready to proceed
with thÂ«s trial of the forgery case. The
! Judge remarked that he thought the
| one sentence would be enough for both
cases? and the forgery case might stand
till it was seen w-hether the sentence
was final, as an appeal was to be taken
to the Supreme Court.
Assistant District Attorney Ashe
said he would need to consult with the
j District Attorney and the case was
i continued till Anril 1 to be set.

fore He Lands From Doric
It was in the steerage that the steam- |
ship Doric, which arrived vesterdaj"
from the Orient, brcusht the most in- I
teresting passengers. There was fine
raiment in the cabin, and a Britisher
v.ho is said to have participated in the i
work preliminary to the Jamieson '
raid in South Africa. The men in the
steerage did not say as much as those ;
in the cabin, nor did they say it in ,
such well-chosen language, but what '
they had to say was more interesting.
In the Doric s steerage were three
seamen and the second mate of the
German steamship Cassius. which ran J
in and out of Vladivostok with coal un- j
til she was so badly in need of repairs
that she was no longer useful as a j
blockade runner. Per oaotaln patched j
ncr up, ran her to a Japanese port and j
sold her to the Mikado's Government
tor a good round sum. The owners of !
rhe Cassius reuped a golden harvest ;
from the Russians, then got a fancy
price for the broken-down steamer. !
This is said to be one of the few In- ;
stances since Japan found herself in '
â Thick the little brown men have been !
outwitted all around.
The Cassius made her first visit to I
Vladivostok last July. She left there
for the last tin.c in February. On the i
first occasion t-he carried a cargo of
coal from Barry. She made six other ;
trips between Vladivostok and Sag
halien Island for more coal. There are >
few prisoners left on Russia's prison
island, say the sailors of the Cassius.
Gradually they have been withdrawn
and taken to tHe front for soldiers. It;
February, when the Cassius limped out
of Vladivostok, provisions -were getting
scarce at the Siberian port and prices
for all necessities ruled high.
FEARED THE JAPANESE.
The crew of the Cassius did n^t want
to go to sea when the time came to
leave. Their vessel was not too sea
worthy and they had the idea that the
Japanese, if they caught the Cassius,
would siring all hands feo th" yardarm.
The German Consul at Vladivostok is i
also the Russian harbor master. He

stayed ashore he would have them sent

tains Hans Hansen, promised to add a
bonus to their double wage and finally
the men agreed to stay by the ship.
Although the Cassiua was under the ,
German flag. Captain Hans Hansen is
a Dane, and all but tvo of the men
under him hailed from the land of the ',
Vikings. The odd pair was German, j
Hans Hansen sailed his ship out of I
Vladivostok and, in the veil of a thhk '
mist, eluded the Japanese cruisers. ;
Once past the danger belt, all hands â 
were Set to work repairing ship. Putty
was used freely and hidden under I
lavish layers i>f bright, new paJnt. The j
engineers extemporized a temporary i
cure of the coughing and wheezing j
with whirji the Cassius' engines, had ,
become afflicted, and when the Ger
man tramp reached Kob% she looked'
smart as the day she launched. And '
before the newness wore off Captain i
Hansen sold her to the Japanese and j
left the island kingdom before prying ;
brown men discovered the putty under j
the paint.
Captain Q. Davis and Chief Engineer '
D. L. Malcolm of the British steam- j
ship Sidonia were also steerage pas- i
sengers on the Doric. They took the \
Sidonia from England to Japan and ;
there sold her to the Government of
the island kingdom. Theirs was a |
purely commercial transaction with ;
never the sight of a Russian flag on !
the voyage out to add spice to the
transaction.
ADOPTS THE PIGTAIL.
Rev. Noel Got. a Roman Catholic ,
priest from France, who has been in '
China as a missionary for sevpn years, j '
was also a steerage passenger on the !
Doric. Although a priest and a j
Frenchman, he traveled by preference (
in the Asiatic steerage among the Chi- ] ,
nese and Japanese. While in China he i
adopted the dress of the country and :
was still wearing it when the Doric j
docked. Even to the shaved head, pig- j
tail and long finger nails, he had lent i
hiniseif to the fashion? of the land in *
which he had wc-rked so long. His eyes
were of the Occident, however, and,
with an aquiline cast of feature, spoil
ed the harmony of Father. Got's other
wise Oriental appearance.
"The Chinese do not like foreigners."
he said in explanation of his attire,
"and when 1 adopted this dress they
accepted me as one of themselves,
which was a great help in my work."
Sff thoroughly has Father Got ab
sorbed the manners of th* Chinese that
he will stay while in this city, he says,
with some Chinese family or at a â 
Chinatown hotel.
He was not allowed to land in his
Oriental garb, however. Immigration
Inspector Crawford, after questioning
the missionary, informed him that he
would be allowed to land, but not in
those clothes. . nd befora he was al
lowed, to go ashore Father Got waÂ« â¢
compelled to don European dr^M and
pass a sartorial inspection before In- .
specter Crawford.
Dr. Rutherford Harris, one of the
Doric's cabin passengers. Is said to
have taken an unfighting part in th*>
Jamieson raid in South Africa. Dr.
Harris did not make himself popular
with the American passengers on the
liner. He has a grouch against the
Tnited States and is said to have lost
no opportunity to swing his little ham- !
mer, using any old American institu- ',
tlon as an anvil. He likes San Fran- '
Cisco only because It is near Victoria
British Columbia.

i.cv. J. A. Milburn. Pastor of

Stage as Vast Moral Power
AX EXPONENT OF (,OOD
Congregational Minister of
Opinion That It Will Kise
to Be Highest Blessing
CHICAGO, March 27.â From the pul
l the Plymouth Congregational
Church, the Rev. Joseph A. Milburn,
the paster has declared the theater a
-r moral power than the pulpit.
There are, of course, incidents of
the theater which are not good." said
"The problem play is a thing of
infinite disgust. The neurotic play is
hysteria. It is pandering to the taste
gh!y seasoned things. But there
it evil incident to all thingsâ to fiction,
to music, even to the church.
Certainly the great drama* la
themselves are not bad- And look at
the great men and queenly and superb
women which the theater has given to
the world.
No, if there is anything which ie
debilitating about a theater it is in
us. If our taste be high and beautiful
we see the high and beautiful at the
theater. It is a reflection of our taste
and mind. We get what we look for.
If we criticize the theater, then" it is
-*lyes we criticize.
The theater will make for universal
amity and peace of nations. For the
great need for universal amity is to
knÂ«T\ one another.
"I believe the stage is a religioua in
stitution and as such is growing great
er. The theater will. I prophesy, one
day rise to become the highest and
moet powerful exponent of good."

my way to recommend the prepara jn â

treatment I had tried more tljan one
standard remedy, but the results as
far as stopping the trouble were just !
as remotely in the distance as when I |
c -first noticed that my kidneys were out

some way the action of my kidneys
was upset was too frequent action of
the kidney secretions, adder!' to the

REMARKABLE ESCAPE
At Work on Railroad Tube
Under Water in* New York
When an Explosion Occurs
NEW YORK. March 27 â Blown
through a break in a tunnel under the
East River by an explosion and shot
Mpward through the water twenty feet j
into the air. Ilichard Creedon, a la- â 
borer, wap rescued and found to be I
only slight ly hurt. His escape from
death r.-ss a.most miraculous. Three
of hiF companions were rescued in the |
tunnel anÂ»l carried out, all painfully
but not seriously injured.
The men were at work in the forward
compartments of the railroad tunnel
under the East River, between Brook
lyn and the Battery, which is to be
used eventually to connect the Man- '
hattan lines with the Brooklyn subway
lines. Two tubes, side by side, are in
process of /construction.
Twenty-two men were at work in
the tunnel when the accident happen
ed. Creedon and his three companions
were in the forward compartment,
working undÂ°r a high pressure of air.
In a compartment back of them thir
teen other men were al work. This sec
ond compartment was not affected by
the*accident. as there was a bulkhead
between them.
Creedon was the first to ascertain
that the roof of the tunnel was leaking
and that the air was rushing out into
the bottom of the East River, which
â was about forty feet above them. With
sandbags he attempted to plug up the
leak, but as he did so the whole roof
â uas blown out and the tremendous
force of the compressed air drove Cree
don out through the hole. The upward
rush of air carried him to the surface
i of the river in a twinking and he shot
I into the air with great force. Bystand
ers quickly rescued him from the wa
ter. He was considerably bruised and
thaken up, but was not dangerously
hurt.
Those who saw the man shoot to the
curface say that he was blown twenty
feet into the air from the level of the
water, and his startling appearance se
verely frightened several Italian labor
ers in a near-by pier and they took
to flight. His companions were drag
ged back through the tunnel by work
men from the next compartment.

BOGUS BILLS

Two 3len Arrested in East
Who Are Said to Have a

IMPRESSIONS ON PAPER
Currency Treated and Then
as Many Copies Can Be
Made as May Be Desired
NEW HAVEN, Conn.. March 27-
ITwo men, supposed to be William Gob^r
i and Samuel Fastow of New York, were
! arrested early to-day at the point of a
revolver in a boarding-house h?re,
where they had stopped three dajs. In
their rooms was found a new counter
feiting outfit which had turned out sev
eral spurious $1 bills, the police assert,
I almost as good as genuine.
The police believe that an entirely
new counterfeiting method has been
discovered, as the plan of turning out
i bogus bills is a departure from the
engraved plate and other methods gen
i erally employed. The plan apparently
j was to take a new bill of any denom
, ination, pour a fluid, said to be from
; Russia, over the bill and then stamp
: the bill on plain sheets of specially pre
| pared paper. After the pieces are
i pressed together for some time, the
| whole is placed on a cylinder much the
j same as a record is placed on a phono
j graph. This is followed by an electrical
! process that makes a perfect reproduc
tion on the white paper. After a dry
[ ing process, the bill is peeled off appar
| ently as good as the one from which
I the copy is made.
The original bill is not spoiled and
the process, it is alleged, can be repeat
ed as many times as desired.

PRODIGAL HAS NO NEWS
OF HIS MISSING AUNT
Frank Ely Rogers Denies That He
Was Kidnaped by the
Young Woman.
CHICAGO, March 27. â The first ap
parently adequate explanation of the
mysterious disappearance of the boy,
Frank Ely Rogers, and his aunt, Mips
Florence Ely, four years ago at
Evanston, was made to-night by James
C. Rogers, father of the boy. Though
simple and straightforward, the truth
of the mystery, according to Rogers, is
stranger than the many fanciful stories
that have been written about the case.
Rogers to-night said:
At the time of the disappearance my son.
Prank, like many boys of his agp, was fired
with a desire to run away from home and see
life for himself. His aunt, a sufferer from
melancholia, was about to be placed by us In
a sanitarium, a proceeding to which she
strongly objected.
As a result of these circumstances the two
left home- together and went to Buffalo. There
they separated. Miss Ely entering a large
store, apparently to do some shopping, and
leaving Frank outside. She had previously
given him a small sum of money. From that
time until now Frank has not seen Miss Ely,
and neither he or we know her whereabouts.
Frank, following out his idea of seeing tha
country, made a living as best he could and
has finally returned home after many vicissi
tudes. This is the explanation of the mystery
as learned by me from my son and is appar
ently the whole truth.

and Made Money Thereby
NEW YORK. March 27. â Gessler
Russell, also known as Gessler Ros
seau. was convicted to-day before Re
corder Goff of having sent, with ma
licious intent, an infernal machine to
the Cunard steamship Umbria in this

ceived the verdict calmly and without
comment and was remanded to the
Tombs for sentence on Friday. The
maximum penalty for the offense is
five years' tprlsonment.

chine sent to the Cunard docks wu
absolutely harmless. In his testimony
Rosseau said:
I have made many infernal ma
chines during my life, and during the
Cuban rebellion I sold a number ai
them to agents for Cuba in this coun
try. They were for blowing up Span
ish ships, and I gave full instructions
to the agents as to their Use."
He said he always made money at
the work. During the Boer war he
offered infernal machine* to the Boer
agents in this country, but his off-r
was refused, the Boers saying they did
not care to fight that way.

TO FREE LABOR
FROM POLITICS
San Francisco Typographical Union
No. 21 has taken a decided stand
against the officers of the union be
coming active in politics. It is main
tained that the safety of trades
unions iies in a complete elimination *>f
the political influences in State as well
as local bodies.
At a regular meeting of San Fran
cisco Typographical Union No. 21, held
last Sunday, the following letter and
proposed amendment to the constitu
tion of the State Federation of Labor
was reported by a committee and
unanimously adopted:
"No person shall hold office in the
California State Federation of Labor
who occupies any political position,
whether elective or appointive."
Several reasons are offered why pol
itics should not be mixed with trades
unionism. History has shown that
where unions have taken an active
part in politics disagreeable results

of a law such as may prevent politi

on some the benefits the union would
derive therefrom would make the ex
ceptions unworthy of consideration.
The Milk Wagon Drivers' Local
Union No. 226 is not satisfied with the
recent decision given by the board of
arbitration of the Labor Council in its
trouble with the Workingmen's Co
operative Commercial Company. In a
lengthy circular issued by this union
1 many reasons are set forth why the
union should not abide by the recent
decision. It is probable that the mat
ter will again be brought before the
council for settlement. The union al
leges that the Workingmen's Co-oper
ative Company, which is a company
selling milk, imposes hardships on the 1
drivers and forces them to work many
hours longer than the union's rules
call for. The circular states that the
milk company can come to a speedy
settlement if it wishes to abide by the
constitution and by-laws of the union.
The District Council of Carpenters

MOTHER WINS
FIGHT FOR BOY
Special Dispatch to Tb* CalL
SPOKANE, Maroh 27.â Baffling a
score of private detectives besides a
few of the city's minions, Mra. J. H.
Spalding, wife of State Senator Spald
ing of Coeur d'A'ene, Idaho, has re
tained possession of her four-year-old
boy for more than a week and bids
fair to keep the child indefinitely. Mrs.
Spalding kidnaped the boy a week ago
Saturday, but the facts only came to
light to-day.
Spalding is a wealthy steamboat man.
DomeÃtic discord resulted in the wife
coming to Spokane to live some months
ago. Spalding retained possession of
the child and left the infant in the
care of his sister and the family while
he attended the Legislature. Saturday
last Mrs. Spalding went to Coeur
d'Alene. The Senator was then en
route from the Legislature. Mrs. Spald
ing completed her short visit and took
the child to the t^pun with her, Respite
the expostulations of Spalding's sister.
After a stormy scene at the train the
two came to Spokane. Here a hack
was waiting for Mrs. Spalding who
hurried the boy into the vehicle and
was driven away.
Since then the search has been un
relenting but futile. The 'sleuths have
been unable to obtain a single clew
since the woman and the boy entered
the hack at the station. Day and night
a dozen men have worked upon the
case and have burned money for mes
sages and other expenses â all in vain â
the woman is still missing and Spald
ing talks of giving up the search.

"BLOOD MONEY,"
SAYS MINISTER
Special Dispatch to The CalL
BOSTON, Mass., March 27â "If that
unfortunate gift cannot be returned, we
ought to appropriate a portion of it to
buy a potter's field in which to bury
the remainder half way to the anti
podes, for it is the price of blood and
is not lawful for either an ancient Jew
ish or a modern Christian treasury,"
said Dr. Charles S. McFarland of Mai
den at a meeting of Congregational
clergymen to-day, referring to John D.
Rockefeller's gift of 1100,000 to the
American Board of Missions.
"There are thoee of us who feel for
Lazarus," Dr< McFarland continued,
"but we cannot furnish this one drop of
water for the tongue of Dives."
In an interview to-night Dr. James
L. Barton, secretary of the American
Board of Commissioners for Foreign
Missions, declared that the proposed
gift of $100,000 by John D. Rockefeller
to the board, which has caused wide
discussion, was unsolicited and spon
taneous, originating in an impulse of
Rockefeller to further the work of the
board. Barton said:
"So far as I know, no person sought
an interview with Mr. Rockefeller or
any member of his family or any mem
ber of his staff of secretaries, and no
letters were written to bring influence
to bear upon him."
MOTH Eli CHARGED WITH
STEALING HER CHILD
Charles T. Rea, Father by Adoption,
Obtains Warrant for Arrest of
Mrs. Jennie Fisher.
Charles T. Rea, 486 Haight street,
obtained a warrant from Police Judge
Mogan yesterday afternoon for the ar
rest of Jennie Fisher on a charge of
child stealing. The child is Edna
Pearl Rea, the adopted daughter of
the complaining witness, and the de
fendant is the child's mother. The
child is about five years of age.
Rea says that since the child was
born the father, R. Gardner Fisher, a
news agent at Dennison, has refused
to contribute toward its support. The
mother was in straitened circum
stances and Rea relieved her of the
burden of keeping the child. On May
24, 1904, Rea procured adoption
papers in Judge Troutt's court.
At 1 o'clock yesterday afternoon
Mrs. P'isher called at Rea's house and
asked to see the child. She talked for
a few minutes and was walking away
with the child when Mrs. Hammes,
the nurse, protested against it. Mrs.
Fipher paid no attention to Mrs.
Hammes' protest and disappeared
with the girl.

NANCE'S CLASS
DEFIES ORDERS
Storm Breaks Over Heads of
Xon - Commissioned
ceis at â¢ the University
RIOT ON THE CAMPUS
Privates Try to Show Con
tempt for Captain Stan
ley and Become Embroiled
BERKELEY. March 27.â Unless the
non-commissioned officers of Captain
Stanley's company of university ca
dets yield up information to Captain
J. T. Nance regarding misdeeds of pri
vates their resignations will be de
manded and a new set of officers will
be installed, according to the dictum
of the United States army officer at
the State University.
The ultimatum from Captain Nance
to this effect followed a sensational
scene on the university campus to
day when the military officer caught
the cadets in Stanley's company hoot
ing and howling and otherwise dis
obeying military regulations while fol
lowing out an order to march in dou
ble-quick time. The company in ques
tion is composed of sophomores. They
received the order from Captain Stan
ley, who is unpopular with many of
them, and at once began a fake charge
on a fake enemy's ramparts, accom
panying the movement with cheers and
catcalls. The sophomores did not
know that Nance waa in their imme
diate vicinity. They were horrified
when he appeared quickly and de
manded the names of the men guilty
of the infraction of military discipline.
Non-commissioned officers of the
company were at once summoned and
required to give the names of offend
ing privates. With visions before
them of what happened to offenders
during the famous students' riot on the
campus last term, when Nance's au
thority was defied and wholesale pun
ishment followed, the non-commis
sioned officers trembled, but traditional
â¢'class loyalty" inspired them 'o re
fuse obedience to Captain Nance's com
mand. They declined to give the
names of the offenders. They were
then informed of Captain Nance's pur
pose to demand their resignations if
they continued to refuse to obey.
There the conflict was allowed to rest.
Captain Nance, under somewhat sim
ilar circumstances last term, soon after
his career as military instructor had
begun, did not treat with offending
students, but called President Wheel
er's attention to delinquencies and set
in motion the college machinery that
is intended to discipline refractory
university men.
It is supposed that Captain Nance
will act in this instance as be did last
term and that the non-commissioned
officers will be called upon to surren
der their commissions and then answer
for disobedience to their military in
structor's orders.
LOSES LARGE SUM OF MONEY
TRYING TO BEAT POOLROOMS
P. V. Finch Takes Advantage of "Wire
Tapping Game," Loses $1900
and Wants Revenge. ,
P. V. Finch of 217 Post street,
sometimes known among the sporting
fraternity as "Doc" Smith, has been
taught, to his sorrow, that It does not
always pay to put up money for an
other man's revenge. Two weeks ago
Finch was approached by a man giv
ing the name of Harry Howard, but
who was subsequently learned to be
the race track habitue, "Bud" Hau
ser, and was asked to put up the
money for a scheme to do the pool
rooms of the city.
Hauser was accompanied by James
Reynolds, and both pretended to be
Postal Telegraph operators. Hauser
declared that he was sore on the
sporting fraternity and would hold
back the racinsr reports a few min
utes if Finch would lend him money
to bet on the horses, and the three
were to share the winnings. The first
move was to mulct Finch of J9O for
a peculiar electrical instrument that
would hold back the mesages, the
bunko men alleging that without it
the accumulated reports would over
heat the wire and cause an explosion.
Finch visited a poolroom on Mar
ket street and there claims to
h;:ve lost nearly $1900 in three
separate bettings on reports tele
phoned by the conspirators. He al
leged that the noolroom took one bet
after the race was run, but the chart
disproved the allegation. Finch de
clares that his suspicion was aroused
by seeing Hauser in conversation with
one of the poolroom partners, but
there is no evidence to show that
the ppolroom owners were connected
with the swindle.
Finch swore out warrants for the
arrest of Reynolds and Hauser under
the name of Howard,' and yesterday
Detective Coleman arrested Reynolds.
The police are looking for Hauser.
Finch now declares that he considers
the money gone, but would pay an
equal amount to get even with his
bilkers. He says he would like to hear
from any persons bunkoed by them.

BERKELEY, March 27â Prompt ac
tion has been taken by the newly
formed students' affairs committee at
the university in the case of J. A. Har
ris, the senior who was detected ftist
week in thefts at college and who con
fessed to his wrongdoing, after being
arrested. The faculty committee on
students' affairs has not yet considered
his case, so far aa ia known, but the

th a university be purged of Harris and
have acted accordingly.
The^ committee met this afternoo*
and after considering Harris' caÂ«Â«
adopted the following resolution:
. Whereas. J. A. Harris, a senior. In ths col
lege of mechanics of thÂ» University of Cali
fornia, has been detected stealing- from - thÂ«

before this committee and has waived th-Â»
privilege of a trial; therefore we. tha under
signed members of the undergraduate student
affairs committee, recommend to the faculty
committee on student affairs that J. A. HarrU
be forthwith expelled from the university -
This is the first opportunity students
of the university have had to demon
strate their intention of assisting to
regulate the student body, in connec
tion with the work of the faculty com
mittee on student affairs.

EVERY PART OF " ZIRA"
Margaret Anglin
Thrills Like
Bernhardt
Boer Camp Chosen
for the First
Scene.
He knew his Anglin that wrote that
third act of 'Zira," that took the house
fairly by the throat last night. And
v c that filled the California knew our
Anglin or.cc again, and again more
Burely, as the Bernhardt of the
Americas.
Much of "Zira" â ail of the second
actâ with due respect to Henry Miller
and J. Hartley Manners, who made it,
does not matter. But a third act, or
rather a scene, of the kind between the
new Magdalen and her destroying
angel would carry anything. One must
grant, however, a Margaret Anglin as
the Zira. One must grant an actress
lie most subtle and sensitive emo
tional fiber, with the power of sustain
ing emotion at breaking pitch, and
an almost unaskable sense of
climax. One must gTant an actress
apable of at once conveying a dozen
different impressions, and welding
them into the portrait of a woman,
Finning, repentant, pleading, fighting,
failing, triumphing, a vulgarian and
lady, a Magdalen and saint. This, with
an art the most finished and touching,
and with a power that none may with
stand, Miss Anglin gives one; and
charmingly as the names of Henry
Miller and Margaret Anglin have ever
been associated, no more valuable
iÃtfcm than that of last night's
piay has been theirs. One wished only
that Mr. Miller had been there to share
in the loot.
A guessing competition as to which is
Miler and which is Manners in the
play would prove of fertile interest.
The plot is Wilkie Collins', freely
handled. however, from that of his
New Magdalen. There is a love scene
between Zira and the minister (Frank
Worthing) that one sees Mr. Miller
:ng in, and there is a soldier por
trait, eminently and excellently remi
ts some of Kipling's, that one
gives to Mr. Manners. Instead of the
Franco-German battlefield. as in
the book, the playwrights have
pitched their first act in a
camp. There is a mild,
'ashioned flavor about its
melodrama -that is distinctly pleasing.
Nurses with their red cross badges, a
wounded Boer â who. however, breaks

the last seat from the beginning to
the end of the performance. The play
was elaborately staged. The players
were all at their best. There was not
one discordant note in the whole piece.
"Old Heidelberg" is not new for
San Francisco... but those who have
seen the play before will still gain
much by seeing it again at the Alcazar
this week. The rollicking students,
the gay Crown Prince, his beautiful
inamorata, the austere count and the
comical old professor furnish all the
entertainment that one could ask for
in a single evening. The love scene and
the final parting at the close are
handled in a way to bring tears to the
eyes of the most blase theater-goer.
John Craig in the role of the Crown
Prince appears at his best. Last night's
audience kept him bowing for an in
definite number of times at the close
of each act. In the last farewell at
Ruder's inn no one could possibly have
handled the part better than he. Lil
lian Lawrence as Kathie furnished ad
mirable support for the leading man.
Many of the ladies present whispered
audibly that she was good enough to
marry Karl Heinrich, even if he was
King of Sachsen-Karlsburg.
John B. Maher was as funny as an
Ade fable in the part of the gray and
bibulous professor, a relic of other
days at the university. John Sainpolis
was an ideal Lutz and convulsed the
audience time after time. Harry Hil
liard was also particularly good in the
part of Graf yon Astreberg. The
others of the cast were up to the high
standard of the leaders.
Central Theater.
One of the best melodramas seen
here in some time was presented at
the Central last evening to a crowded
house. 'The Gambler" is far above
the average play and the manner in
which it was interpreted left but lit
tle to find fault with. The* scenic ef
fects, notably those^ of the first and
second acts, redound great credit on
the artists. Messrs. Simmons and
Cutler. The stage mechanics de
serve praise for the admirable man
ner in which the production was
mounted. The leading role was by
Herschel Mayall, who divided honors
with Henry Shumer, who played the
villain. Miss Juliet Crosby made much
of her part. Miss Crosby is at her best
in emotional work and this role was
strictly in accord with the popular
leading woman's talent. Miss Vane
also made a decided hit in her part.
True Boardman, the new juvenile
man. though not having much to do,
did it well. Millar Bacon, the come
dian, surpassed all his former efforts,
others deserving mention include G.
Klcholla and Walter Whipple. The
lighthouse scene, wherein the hero
makes his escape in the ocean and
the rescue by a yacht while a terrible
storm rages was vigorously applauded.
There are many thrilling situations
and climaxes. The play will be a win
ner for the week.
Orpheuni.
There was another crowded house
at the Orpheum last night and those
who expected to hear Don Francisco
de Souza. Marquis de Borba, were not
disappointed. He had sufficiently re
covered from his cold to appear, but
it was evident that he did so at a
sacrifice. He sang the toreador's
song from "Carmen" and "The
Palms." He has a magnificent bary
tone voice, clear and resonant, and at
once established himself as a prime
favorite. The applause after his sec
ond effort was deafening, and an an
nouncement had to be made that he
had Just left a sickbed and begged
to be excused.
Chutes.
Tom Mack, a highly original mono
logist and late star of West's Min
strels, made his first appearance at
the Chutes yesterday and created un
bounded merriment at both perform
ances. Mr. and Mrs. James, refined
musical artists, produced pleasing
music from all kinds of instruments,
and McCarver. Reed and Bamboo,
colored singers and dancers, gave a
lively specialty. John T. Chick and his
company of comedians revived "A
Pleasant Evening." Mabel Lamson,
the popular contralto, was heard in
new illustrated songs, and the ani
matoscope showed the latest novelties
in moving pictures. Charles Bigney
continues to make his daring high
dives every afternoon and evening, and
on Thursday night the feature of the
amateur performance will be a three
legged race for fat woman.

Ashbury Heights Club Sub
mits Ordinance to Place
All Wires Underground
The Board of Supervisors yesterday
adopted die majority recommendation
of the Police Committee that a five
year lease of the Sailors' Home be
granted to the Sailors' Protective So
ciety. The Indies' Seamen's Friend
Society, which now conducts the insti
tution, had also petitioned for a re
newal of the lÂ°ase.
Attorney W. H. Brown pleaded for a
renewal of the lease to the Ladies'
Seamen s Friend Socffety, which, he
paid, had conducted the home for twen
ty-live years successfully and had in
vested 540,000 ii improving it. Brown
said the society is non-sectarian and
every denomination is represented on
ihe board of management with the pos
sible exception of the Catholics.
George Connelly, attorney for the
Sailors' Protective Society, stated that
the society had been organized for the
purpose of appiytng for a lease of the
homr- only after the Seamen's Friend j
Society had refused to give representa- |
tion on its board of trustees to four
members of the Catholic denomination.
He said that after the organization was ;
effected an offer was made to give
Catholics representation on the board, |
but the new society decided to pres^
its application for the lease. It was pro
posed t-j srive representation to six out
side denominations, the Collector of
the Port and the Mayor of San Fran- !
cisco on the board of trustees, which,
Connelly assured the Supervisors,
would be non-sectarian.
WANTS LEASE RENEWED.
Supervisor Boxton, chairman of the
Police Committee, urged that the lease
be again given to the society now hold
ing it, because its management had
been of the best and it had offered rep
resentation to the opposing society on
its board.
Supervisor Gallagher's motion that a
condition be imposed that the man
agement btf non-sectarian prevailed, as
did also D'Aru-ona's motion that the
board of trustees shall be so constitut
ed that no single religious denomina
tion shall be in the majority.
Brandtnstein opposed the resolution
on the ground that it would be an in
justice to deprive the society now con
ducting tht home of the management
thereof.

ciety was:

TRUST AFTER
FISH INDUSTRY
Special Dispatch to The Call.
TACOMA, March 27. â A movement is
on foot which, if carried out, will re
sult in the cornering of the fishing in
dustry at the mouth of the Columbia
River; the fishermen on the Washing
ton side who have carried on the indus
try fox many years will be driven from
the field, iand the towns of Ilwaco and
Ch'r.ook practically wiped from the
map.
One plan is to extend the grounds at
the mouth of the channel and establish
traps which will cut off the hundreds
of traps farther up the bay. After qui
etly driving stakes and securing loca
tions, agents of a reputed syndicate
made application to the War Depart
ment to have the grounds extended,
claiming that the old channel is no
longer suitable for navigation. Should
the Government grant their application

SAY EPILEPSY
CAUSED DEATH
Special Dispatch to ThÂ« Call.
NAPA, March 27.â The trial of at
tendants T. D. Shanahan and Oscar
Ritzman of the Napa State Hospital
on a charge of killing patient LiUia at
the institution last December was re
sumed in the Superior Court this morn
ing. Dr. I. Cohn, third assistant physi
cian at the asylum, testified that he
was present when Dr. L. A. Frary made
the autopsy on Luis' body. He said he
believed that Luis' death was due to
cardiac epilepsy and not to shock from
his injuries. He declared that the
E-shaped marks on the body of the pa
tient could not have been made by
striking him with a strap tipped with
a brass buckle.
At the afternoon session Dr. Cohn
stated that from the examination of
the body of Luis made on December 26
he concluded that the ribs were broken
when Attendant Shanahan fell upon
Luis' body after Ritzman had pulled
the patient's legs from under him. Dr.
A. J. Kahn, a well-known Xapa physi
cian, was then called to the stand. He
stated that the death of Luis was due
to an epileptic fit which he had in
tensified by fiercely struggling with the
attendants. The E-shaped marks or
bruises on Luis' abdomen, said
Kahn, were caused by the severe pres
sure against a brass buckle and were
not made by blows. Dr. W. Rumsey
gave practically the same opinion in
the case as Dr. Kahn.
Frank Teague, head attendant of
ward B at the time of tragedy, testi
fied that several times he saw patients
at the asylum come in with broken or
cut restraint straps. He said that at a
lecture given by Superintendent E. E.
Stone of the asylum last summer the
advisability of pulliner the feet of a pa
tient from under him was discussed.
The method was indorsed as proper
under trying circumstances.
Teague's testimony closed the case
for the defense. The trial will be re
sumed to-morrow morning.

THE REFERENDUM.
THE advocates of the initiative and referendum, by which it is
proposed to practically abolish the legislative branch of the
'> ci'iinem at once, to be eventually followed into disuse by the
courts, habitually point to it as a system that will put government
immediately into the hands of the good people, who will use direct
legislation to the advancement of righteousness.
The real motive of those who are behind the movement is to
destroy representative government. They care but little what takes
â¢ whether it is better or worse. The proposition is an in
â  attack upon our whole political syst-m. VVhen the fathers
founded this Government and put it under a written constitution so
â C ihat it could not be formed to-day, they had in mind several
â niials to the perpetuity of our institutions. Many of the early
republics fell through lack of development of their representative
legislative bodies. They had a Legislature consisting of only one
branch. That left out a check and balance, the lack of which finally
caused the whole governmental machinery to knock itself to pieces,
like an engine with no governor.
The prolonged life of the English Government and its present
prospect of perpetuity are due to the evolution of a parliamentary
Mstem composed of two houses, and imposing checks and balances
against party and hectic legislation, as well as against corruption
and prejudice. In the evolution of that system there has been a
ontinual enlargement of the electorate, until now through the fran
chise the people, by representation, impress themselves broadly
upon their Government.
When our Government was formed all the lessons of the past
were known to its founders. They knew the perils of direct legisla- j
. They were aware of the dangers of a single legislative cham- ]
\\ hat they knew has been stated by Mill, to the effect that a
ttoti made up of Isaac Newtons would prove unable to govern
el! by direct legislation, or. in the language of our modern
]>seitdo- reformers, by the "initiative and referendum." Therefore i
they gave to us representative government and a Congress of two i
houses, each a check upon the other. They properly called it re- ]
publican government and charged Congress with the duty of guard
anteeing that kind of government to every State.
The structure they built is put in peril by the proposal of the j
and initiative. The people adopt, directly, their funda- j
ital law and amendments thereto. They vote directly upon propo- I
ns to issue bonds as evidences of public debt in certain cases, :
otherwise they entrust the business of government to their rep
ntatives, whose work is subject to review by the courts, which i
\gt of its constitutionality. For more than a century this system
done its intended work and it has created the greatest free insti
Â«ns under which man has ever existed. Now come the ferment- i
and the agitators, the uneasy and the restless spirits of the
country, with a proposed change, which entirely destroys the system
crested by the founder* of the Government.
I >regon is the only State that has adopted the new-fangled plan :
,c initiative and referendum. It has been invoked three times:
that State and every time for a bad. obstructive and destructive!
pose. It was used to obstruct the railway around the Dalles of
ihe Columbia River, a project universally approved as a regulator
of transportation rates. Xext it was used by industrial agitators to
hold up the Lewis and Clark Exposition at Portland, and to so
burden that interesting and public spirited enterprise as to make it
impossible had the attempt succeeded. The third use of this new
'.â¢-m is now on, in the shape of holding up the general appropria
bill passed by the Legislature for the support of the entire
State government and institution':.
rcgou has made 1 lie unpleasant discovery that it is not the I
1 Â»<-..- 1 citizens nor the most useful who invoke this power to obstruct.
The State has also discovered that it is invoked not against bad
measures, but against good, that are necessary to the commonwealth
and that enhance its honor and its place among American States. A
ail minority, by petition that is easily obtained, can delay impor
tant public projects and. as in the case of the general appropriation
bill, can parai\ ze the government itself, by preventing it from using
the funds necessary for its operation.
This is the first result aimed at by the advocates of the system. |
â¢ y* all stability in a State, and puts its affairs and its very
existence in the keeping of agitators and demagogues. Order ami
will soon succumb when public affairs are subjected to such dis
". urbance and strain. But it is useless to point out these results to
the advocates of the plan as dangerous to government, for they wish
to destroy government. Behind them stalk socialism or anarchy,
and all of the fanatical plans for a new social condition, in which
property, government and even the family, shall have no part nor
place. The sore experience of Oregon will not teach these pseudo
reformers anything. They have done and are doing in that State
â¢ what they wanted and intended to do when they induced the
gislature to give them the opportunity. U is probable that the
â â . er they have secured can be successfully used to prevent a return
representative government. But the case should appeal to men
-ense, who esteem our representative form of government, and
cause them to prevent the spread of this political pestilence into
other commonwealths.
THE NEXT NAVAL BATTLE.
RUSSIA'S Baltic fleet, according to a recent dispatch from Suez,
has now passed through the canal, and the last component of
it. Admiral XebogatofF's squadron, has sailed southward.
I "pen thr outcome of the meeting of this now completed fleet of
Rojestvensk\ > with Admiral Togo's warships the fate of Russia
her war with Japan to a large extent depends. It is probably the
playing of the Czar's last stake before the terms of peace are de
cided upon. The result of the coming contest for naval supremacy
in the Far East will be of interest to neutral powers, because the
longer Russia feels encouraged to extend the war, and the longer
the Japanese amies are successful on land, so much greater reason
will Japan have for the permanent annexation of Manchuria.
Until the test of battle comes the Russian fleet will make the
mof being superior to the Japanese. The Russians have twenty
Viattleships and cruisers, nine of which have been built since 1900.
lapan in order to cope with it will have to use superior skill in navi
gation and gunnery to her opponent. She can almost be relied on
to do this. She will have the advantage of maneuvering in familiar
waters, and Togo certainly has that superiority which should be
attributed to greater practice in the art of destroying his country's
enemies. Interest in the great game will certainly now *oon be
shifted from the land battles, where Japan's proficiency is such that
ihe expected always happens and consequently excitement ceases
out the outcome of, the moves, to the coming sea fight, where
Russia's material superiority will put such a handicap on Japan's
as will tend to equalize the chances.
Whether a Russian victory would be productive of peace by
preventing Russia from continuing the war out qf mere national
pride, or whether it would cause her obstinately to prolong hostili
ties, is very questionable; but that a big Japanese victory would
bring things to a swift finality is far less open to question, and i 3

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL. TUESDAY, MARCH 28, 1905.
QUEEN OF DIAMONDS
THE usually cheery face of Mme.
Fontaine, "Palmist and Card
Reader." was overcast. Even
the invitingly clean little room
where Madame received the anxious
seekers after wisdom shared in the
' pervading gloom. A crudely drawn
i hand covered with cabalistic signs had
become detached from the wall and
â¢ lay unheeded in one corner; the cards
by whose aid coming events were
evoked were pushed carelessly aside.
It was evident that misfortune had
fallen upon this faithful priestess of
the future.
Nora McCabe had always been a
, wonder at "cuttin' the cards," and it
was when Pat McCabe died (an event
which the cards neglected to mention),
leaving her with five little children,
that Mme. Fontaine had sprung into
f existence. Having an average amount
of quick Irish wit, and more than an
average understanding of human na
: ture, Nora had prospered, and as Mme.
Fontaine she avoided tragedy and dealt
1 mostly In romantic and glowing gen-
I eralities.
But of late the fates had not shown
Madame the consideration due so faith
ful a follower. There had been a fall
ing off in the number of people who
came to explore the misty paths of the
future under her expert guidance. Four
of the children were too young to do
1 much besides consume unlimited sup
plies of bread and butter and the day
before Jimmy, the eldest, had been
brought home with a broken leg. In
short, the outlook was serious.
"Though it isn't always ye can ex
pect to he havin' the luck," sighed
! Nora, stooping to pick up the hand
! that pointed a mutely protesting finger
at her from the corner.
Quite unconscious of the radiant pic
ture she made against her dull sur
! roundings, a girl, tall, graceful, tailor
' made, came swiftly along the shabby
I street. If her courage almost failed
. her, she made no sign as she walked
! steadily on. All the girls had been to
I Mme. Fontaine. Had she not told Mar
garet Doane that she would be married
within a year, and was not Margaret
even now on her wedding Journey? To
! be sure she had told Louise Henderson
: the same thing, and there was not
even an admirer in Lou's horizon, but
then every one makes mistakes some
times, and Louise always was hopeless.
She did not really believe in it. Oh,
dear, no! but she did so want to know
if John really were very angry. He
might have known she did not care for
that stupid Captain Carstairs.
With flushed face and trembling but
determined fingers, she pressed the
button under the card bearing the le
gend "Mme. Fontaine" and soon stood
quaking inwardly, but outwardly se
rene, before the door of the modest
little flat.
Eleanor Robinson was called the
prettiest girl in the Westchester set.
and more critical eyes than Madame's
would have brightened at the radiant
vision she made as she entered the
little room, and with shining eyes bent
eagerly forward over the well-known
table upon which Madame's experi
enced fingers had already placed the
queen of diamonds.
"That's yourself," explained the
woman, as she deftly shuffled the
cards, "and this." laying a heart above
it, "is good luck to yourself an' yer
wish, an' here's an offer, an' a folne
offer It is, with money, too. It looks
like a marriage offer an' 'tis from "
But whom it was from must forever
remain a mystery, for a shrill voice
: from the next room called Madame and
in her anxious haste Nora overturned
the little table, and the fortunes of the
queen of diamonds came to an igno
minious ending on the floor.
"I'm that worried I don't know what
I'm doin'," said Madame as she came
back, and half crying stooped to pick
up the cards. "My Jimmy has his leg
broke, an' him gettin' along so nice,
an' Mr. Chetwood sayin' his wages
should be raised this Saturday coinin."
"Mi\ Chetwood!" interrupted the girl
in a strained voice, and Madame's keen
eyes noted the warm wave of color
that flooded her face.
"Yes. miss." she returned. "Mr. Chet
wood, the lawyer. It was a foine place
for Jimmy, an' him likin' it an' gettin'
I into Mr. Chet wood's ways. An' now
i his leg's broke, an' no knowin' when
he'll git another place,"" she added de
jectedly, and in spite of herself a tear
splashed on the recovered queen.
The girl rose. "I don't believe I care
1 to have my fortune told to-day," she
, said nervously. "Iâ l've changed my
mind, but I shall come to see you
again," she said, her blue eyes sweet
with sympathy. She took a bill from

"I want you to take good care of him.
No! No! That's all right:" as she
tried to thank him. "You may pay it
back when Jimmy wins his first case,
or you might tell my fortune." He
laughed good-humoredly, looking quiz
zically at the weird hands decorating
the little room beyond.
Madame gasped. Her warm Irish
heart was full of gratitude to the two
who had been so good to her. If onjy
she could do something for them.
He watched her with amused inter

on the little table.
"Ye have success to yerself and yer
wish." she began in the time-worn
formula; "an' there's a light woman,
the queen of diamonds." she added, her
eyes fastened on the cards.
John Chetwood threw back his head
and laughed delightedly. "I thought
it was always a dark woman." he said.
"She's tall almost as yerself." Nora
went on, "and it's like one of the saints

on his face deepened as he ran lightly
down the stairs.
He hesitated outside the shabby lit
tle fiat. She lived to the north. A
few blocks to the west his friends were
waiting for him. He had tried to keep
away from her; it was evident she
cared for Carstairs, and he would
keep his disappointment to himself and
let no knowledge of it shadow her.
What could that woman know about
it? Nothing! Queer, though, about
the violets. No; of course he didn't
believe it, but he squared his shoulders
and turned to the north.

HIS WILL IN RHYME.
"We get some queer wills here,"
said Deputy Registrar Stroup of Har
risburg. Pa., a few days ago. "But
here is one that beats anything I have
ever seen since I have been here." Mr.
Stroup produced a small sheet of pa
per, which contained:
â When my wife's a widow, of me bereft,
She shall inherit all I've left;
And when she's finished her careÂ«r
It then shall go to my daughter dear.
"This document was duly attested as
a will and was received for probate.
It came from the lower end of the
county and will be the guide in set
tling an estate."

TWAIN'S LATEST.
Here is a new Mark Twain anec
dote which, among thousands of its
kind, has a peculiar ring of genuine
ness. Some years ago Mark Twain's
home in Hartford was invaded with
scarlet fever. The disease raged for
some weeks, when heroic measures
were taken to disinfect the house. "We
had a fumigator so strong," said Mark
Twain, "that it took all the brass off
the doorknobs and all the tune out of
the piano."
A French suggestion for preventing
automobilists from "scorching" is to
forbid the use of masks and goggles.

BOY AND MOTHER.
I think that one of the most pe
culii ly aweet affections is that exist
ing between a big. sturdy boy and hi*
mother, says a writer in the Dallas
News.
Did you ever notice it? See with
what pride the little woman seems to
regard her boy Apparently she fee!*
as safe under his care as if he were a
giant her".
And see with what tenderness,
though awkwardly (.and in the pres
ence of others timidly), he caresses
her.
She seems to say: "Her* is ray Joy.
and maybe my protector and support
in years to come."
And he: "This ia my dear littl*
mother. lam going to do great thing*
for her when I get to be a man. Th"
boys may tease me for kissing aer. anl
really Id rather they didn't see me do
it. but I love her â a heap better eren
than she thinks."
He is not always prompt in obedi
ence to her commands, but she doean t
worry, for she knows that she only
has to convince him that she is trust
ing him. and her wishes will be com
plied with.
She is patient and considerate; he Is
tender and strong.
Such a boy will never break tits
mother's heart. She seems to feel sure
of this. Only such a boy can hay*
such a mother. Only such a mother
can have such & son.
I take off my hat in respect, lore and
admiratkm for them both.
In them lies the hope of the nations.
WE LIKE SUGAR.
That Americans are the greatest
candy-eaters in the world Is a familiar
fact, but that the national liking for
sweets tends generally to all articles
containing sugar In large amounts is
not so well known.
The consumption of sugar in the
United States has been steadily rising
for twenty years and now exceeds that
of any other country. It amounts to
seventy-twp pounds a head of popula
tion, the figures being as follows for
other nations: England, 68 pounds,
Denmark. 35; France, 30; Holland.
30; Switzerland, 27; Germany
Sweden. 20; Italy. 10. and Spain. 6.
The consumption Qf sugar in th*
United States exceeds in * year
2.600,000 tons, and it approximates the
total consumption of sugar on the
whole European continent â equaling
that of all Europe, exclusive of Great
Britain, in which the consumption
amounts to 1,500,00Â© tons a year.
The American craving for sugar, so
far from showing any indications of
decline, seems to be on the Increase.
as is shown, says the New York Sun.
by the fact that the average consump
tion per capita has Increased half a
pound in five years.

OCEAN VOYAGE
Sonoma ( arries From Hono
lulu to Auckland a Well
( redentialed Stowaway
LETTER FROM PREMIER
Claude Thompson Is Recom
mended by High Official as
an "Intelligent Socialist*'
Thr Oceanic Steamship Company's
liner Sonoma, which arrived yesterday,
carried, on the outward trip from Hon
olulu to Auckland, probably the best
credentialed stowaway that ever beat
his paaaage between two ports. Claude
Thompson was his name. He had been
visiting the United States and returned
to the Antipodes with a poor opinion of
the land of the free.
He stowed away here on a Pacific
Mail steamer, from which he was land
ed at Honolulu, where he joined the
Sonoma. The Sonc-ma was well on her
way toward the Antipodes when Claude
was discovered. In addition to $S and
an American flag, the stowaway had
letters of recommendation from Hugh
de LÂ»arjie, an Australian Senator, and
from J. C. Watson, who was Premier of
the Commonwealth Parliament when
he wrote, to whom it may concern: "I
can recommend Claude Thompson as a
straightforward and intelligent Social
ist."
The American flag in Thompson's
possession was something of a curios
ity. Down every stripe was written a
coarse and uncomplimentary criticism
of the American people, and standing
among the stars was drawn a figure of
a Russian Finn, chained hand and foot
to a tree. Beneath this work of art
was a legend which explained the iron
ed Finn as typical of .the condition of
the American workingman.
Claude played American workman in
the Sonoma's stokehole untH the liner
arrived at Auckland, where he disem
barked. Claude was bound for Sydney
and reached there before the Sonoma
sailed. The people on the Sonoma
know he arrived because he wrote them
a letter saying that he had missed a
valise and would like somebody to look
around on the liner and see if he left
it there.
CONVICTED MEN
FIGHT IN CELL
Thomas Fallon. Who Mur
dered Wife. Attacks One of
officer Robinson's Slayers
The prisoners confined in the County
Jail on Broadway have a sensation to
relieve the monotony of their retired
lives, and every cell is full of the gos
sip of it. There has been a fight be
tween William Henderson, who was
one of the gang that murdered Police
man Eugene Robinson, and Thomas P.
Fallen, under sentence of death for the
murder of his wife, Agnes, in April of
last year. The affair has filled the jail
with excitement owing to the promi
nence of the principals in higher crimi
nal ( ircles. Fallon is accused. In fact,
of having tried to kill Henderson be
cause of the general hatred said to ex
ist against the latter, who turned
State's evidence and helped send his
companions to the gallows or the peni
tentiary.
The uproar has extended further than
the Jail. District Attorney Byington
has expressed surprise that a man sen
tenced to be hanged and one who has
turned State's evidence and earned the
enmity of his fellow prisoners should
be placed in the same cell. He says
that a man who is under sentence of
death might not feel backward about
killing a man who had "peached" an
fellow criminals. He demands that
Sheriff Curtis explain.
The trouble occurred Sunday morn
ing about breakfast time. Henderson
says he was reading a paper when Fal
lon attacked him with a Jelly glass,
striking him on the head with it and
then trying to beat him as he lay dazed
in the corner of the cell. He fought
hiÃ way to his feet and Jailers came to
the rescue.
Fallon says that Henderson started
the trouble by calling him a vile name
and that the two fought with their
fists only. He says that the cuts that
exist in Henderson's scalp were in
flicted with a ring on his (Fallon's)
finger. He denies using the glass. He
says that Henderson has been very dis
agreeable and hard to get along with.
Frank Marshall, another prisoner in
the same cell, says Fallon was the ag
gressor. He did not see him use the
glass, but says it lay In fragments on
the floor after the fight.
rhief Jailer Sullivan, In his report to
' Sheriff Curtis, places the blame on
Henderson. He says that the men had
, got along all right for five months.
j He put Fallon in another cell down
stairs after the trouble.
Henderson had a cut over one eye, in
which two stitches were taken, and an
other on the back of his head.

THE SAX FRAXCISCO CALL, TUESDAY. MARCH 28, 1905.
MUST PUT NAME
ON THE BALLOT
Supreme Court Rules Against
Steve Kelly Faction in
City of San Bernardino
PARTY GOVERNING BODY
Decision Upholds the Action
of the Republican State
Gommitee in the Case
The Supreme Court yesterday issued ;
a peremptory writ of mandate directed i
to City Clerk Harry Allison of San ;
Bernardino, compelling him to place I
the name of J. J. Hanford, Republican |
candidate for Mayor, on the ballot un- '
der party designation for the local elec- i
tion, April 10. It appears that a ma- j
jority of the Republican committee of j
San Bernardino decided against hold- j
ing a regular party convention, resolv- I
ing to place a non-partisan ticket in i
the field. The minority members ot
the committee, however, filled vacan- !
cies, called a convention and nor- i
ir.ated a ticket. The City Clerk re- |
fused to place the ticket on the ballot I
and the Superior Court declined to is- i
sue a writ of mandate compelling him j
to do so. In the meantime the execu- I
tive committee of the Republican State
Committee was appealed to and ren- j
dered a decision contrary to that ren- j
dered by the City Clerk.
General George Stone, chairman of
the State Committee, regards the Su- j
preme Court ruling asÂ» particularly ad- j
vantageous to the organization, mas- '
much as it recognizes the committee !
as the governing body of the party in j
fact as well as in name.
The election law excludes from party
designation any party that cast less ]
than 3 per cent of the vote at the prior j
election. Exclusion of the Republican j
ticket In this election would compel i
the party to resort to petition at the j
next election in order to find a place on !
the ballot.
The point was raised by Byron '
Waters, counsel for the City Clerk,
that the State committee in recogniz
ing the minority convention performed
a judicial function, which it had no j
authority in law to perform. The Su- i
preme Court practically holds that the j
law authorizes the committee as tho !
governing body of the party to settle !
disputes of this nature. The court in- j
quired if the City Clerk in refusing to ;
give the Republican party a designa- j
tion on the ballot was not performing J
a judicial function.
The ruling of the State committee
happened to be adverse to the Repub- j
liran faction iiÂ» San Bernardino, head- i
ed by Steve Kelly. The fight Is now
on, with Kelly leading the non-par- j
tisan forces, embracing many inde- j
i pendent Republicans and the regulars [
\ are headed by J. J. Hanford. General !
, Stone maintains that the "organiza
tion" has no preferences in the local
contest, but as the governing body of
! the party, under the law it is bound to â 
decide where disputes of this charac- |
ter are submitted for decision.
It is contended that if the law were
interpreted as Steve Kelly's support
ers in San Bernardino would have the '
! courts Interpret it, the majority of a
! committee could assassinate the party i
which it. was chosen to perpetuate by j
simply refusing to call a convention.
The decision rendered by the Supreme |
Court gives the minority a right to
maintain a party organization when !
the majority fails or 'efuses to act.

SUPERVISORS
DENY CHARGE
Lv listed t Makes Vigorous
Demand That Alleged
Corruption Be Probed
OTHER OFFICIALS SPEAK
City Attorney to Pass On
Resolution for Municipal
Half Holiday on Saturday
Supervisor Lunstedt rose to a ques- !
tion of personal privilege at yester- ;
day's meeting of the Board of Super
visors relative to the published charges
that certain Supervisors had last year
demanded $500 apiece from the San
Francisco Gas and Electric Company
in return for fixing a favorable gas
rate. Said he:
"I pronounce the charge entirely .
false and malicious. The reason for
the insinuation I do not know, unless
it was for political purposes. I stand
ready to have my vote on any munici
pal measure investigated and I earn
estly request that the matter be weigh
ed by a court of competent jurisdic- <
ticn."
Supervisor Rea told of the denial
made by President W. B. Bourn ot
responsibility for the article.
"Mr. Bourn declared to me that the j
company had never approached any
body," said Rea, "nor did any of the
Supervisors approach the company's
officials. A great wrong was done. I
think the matter should be taken up
by this board and every effort should
be made to bring Lawless, the former
manager, who, it is alleged, made the
charge, back to the city."
EGGEKS MAKES DENIAL.
Supervisor Eggers also denied that
he was in any way connected with the
allegation and Supervisor Alpers, who
was also accused, stated that the only
visits he ever made to the gas com
pany's office were when he paid a gas
bill.
Supervisor Eggers' resolution di
recting the attention of the Board of
Works to the unsightly and unsani
tary condition of the receptacles for
street sweepings along Market street
was referred to the Street Committee. \
The City Attorney was requested to
furnish his opinion in the matter of a
proposed resolution suspending all ,
municipal business every Saturday j
afternoon from May 13, 1905, in com
pliance with a State law recently en
â  acted by the Legislature. Supervisor
Comte was of the opinion that the law
was clear on the point, but deemed it
wise to refer the resolution to the City i
I Attorney.
SOME OFFICES OPEN.
The resolution directs the County
Clerk. Justices' Clerk, Sheriff and Re
corder to keep their offices open on
Saturdays until 5 p. m. with a mini
mum force of employes to accommo
| date the public. It also provides that
' no deduction is to be made from the
pay of city employes affected by the
law.
A resolution was adopted authoriz- I
ing: the Mayor' to execute a deed to
I Joseph F. Nolan, as successor In inter
<?s*. to James F. Treadwell, to lands
bounded by Hayes. Fulton and Clayton
I streets and Masonic aveune.
The petition of Margaret Bannon
offering to compromise her suit for
$10,000 damages for the killing of her

excavation was referred to the Ju- ,
di>-iai y Committee.
Property-owners petitioned that the ;
w^rk of raising the grade at Polk and

The petition of the St. Mary's Square
Association and Paulist Fathers that
the sum of 525,000 be included in the
| next budget for the acquisition of lands
! for St. Mary's Square was referred to
the Finance Committee. The petition
says that property of the value of $83,

PREFERS HYMN
TO AN ANTHEM
Dx.. Needham Favors Faulty
Singing by Congregation
to Proxy - Acting Choirs
OPPOSES CHEAP LABOR
Methodist Preachers' Meet-
ing Says Undesirable
Classes Should Be Checked
Dr. A. T. Needham of Alameda is
of the opinion that no hymn should
give place to anthem or solo or "sky- j
scraping soprano effort or deep-sea '
plunge of bass." The doctor expressed j
his views yesterday when addressing i
the Methodist preachers* meeting at !
the Central Methodist Episcopal
Church on "Hymnology."
He conceded that musical declama
tion was not to be despised, but when
it arrogated to itself the place right
fully belonging to the congregation
then he rebuked and repelled its in- !
trusion. Better faulty congregational
singing, he declared, than perfect art
by a cultivated choir. He had known
choirs to insist on fewer hymns so as
to have more time for their artistic
work.
If either should give place to the
other he held that it was not the hymn
that should give precedence to the
anthem or the solo or to "any other
sky-scraping soprano effort or deep
sea plunge of bass."
Dr. Needham said that they were
"not yet prepared for airships that fly I
with gas but cannot carry, nor for I
submarine navigation that fails for
want of oxygen."
A resolution was passed in confor
mity with a report presented by Dr. H.
B. Johnson, Dr. George B. Smyth and
Dr. W. S. Matthew on the stand taken
against cheap labor classes of all coun
tries.
The election of officers for the fol
lowing six months resulted with the
choice of Dr. George W. White for
president; Dr. H. B. Johnson, vice
president; Rev. W. P. Stanley, secre
tary, and Rev. J. H. N. Williams, Dr.
E. R. Willis and Rev. George A.
Hough, programme committee.
Dr. Katharine Bushnell delivered a
profound address on "The Ministry of
Women" before the Presbyterian Min
isters' Union yesterday.
SHRINERa OF ISLAM TEMPLE
ENJOY A THEATER PARTY
The Red Fexzed Members Present
Each Lady Who Attended a
Novel Candy Souvenir.
Islam Temple of the Ancient Arabic
Order of the Nobles of the Mystic
Shrine had a theater party at the Ma
jestic last evening. The house, which
was owned by the Shriners, was
crowded with a fashionable audience,
the members of the temple wearing
the traditional red fez, and many of
the ladies wearing dainty white fezes.
As each lady entered the theater she
was given a souvenir of the occasion
in the form of a simetar-shaped box
filled with choice candies. The play
was "My Wife's Husbands," quite
amusing and made more interesting
by interpolated Shriner jokes at the
expense of prominent members of the
temple. During the evening a corps
of waiters served lemonade between
acts to all persons in the house.

FRED E. MULHOLLAND
The card at Oakland track yesterday
proved just as difficult of solution as it
looked. The fields all wore an oj>en
look and Rev Dare was the only public
choice to be decorated with winning
brackets. The attendance was large
and the track ie again in good condi
tion.
James Nealon's brown gelding. Rey
Dare, demonstrated to the satisfaction
of all that he was a legitimate 7 to 5
chance for the introductory seven-fur
long run. Lloyd Fountain got him
away twelfth in a field of fourteen, and
then, skimming the rail, won in a gal
lop. Glen Brier, a 10 to 1 shot, which
made the running, took second place
from Foxy Grandpa.
Most racegoers are like the man from
Pike County. They won't believe a
horse can do a thing until they see it
performed. Sun Rose won at five fur
longs only a few days ago, but as six
and a half furlongs was considered out
uf his line the books laid 21 to 5 about
the filly in the betting oh the second
event. She went out ard won all the
way, Angelica finishing second, six \
lengths before Andvari. Baker, the 9
to 10 favorite, at no time seemed over
burdened with speed, running fourth.
Jakie Jones piloted Lady King, the 7
to" i favorite for the two-year-old
scramble. The filly appeared shy of
Speed from the start and ran unplaced.
The winner turned up in Charley Patter
sor.s Busy Bee, the mount of Bullman
aod 7 to 1 in the betting. When the
two leaders. Southern Lady and Moor
opus, became tired Busy Bee kept right
on. scoring almost easily by four
lengths in :48. Southern Lady finished
second. â¢
If the mile and fifty yards event
were to be run over to-day, the chances
are Senerlty would not win. The mare
received steady support. Miller got her
away well and, after making all the
pace, she beat Augie a head. Knapp
did not ride one of his gilt-edged races
on .the latter, which closed favorite, or
the gelding would have won. Mounte
bank, after some ill luck at the start,
came from behind, finishing third.
Possart made his first start at the
meeting and did well.
Sincerity Belle gave a refreshing re
versal of form by being awarded a
nose decision over Meistersinger and
Evea G at the close of the seven-fur
long selling affair. The filly was well
backed at S to 1. and Taylor brought
her along from last position. Evea G
went to the post a 2*Â£ to 1 favorite,
and should have won.
To say the least, the final mile purse
run had a decidedly peculiar flavor i
about it. Blue Eyes, said to be a good
thing and a 9 to 5 favorite, was beaten
off. Neva Lee and Morita. long shots,
and both maidens, led the field for six
furlongs. Then Soufriere, backed from
3 to 2Â»i to 1, took the play, actually
rolling: in first. Morita ran second and
c Neva Lee third.
TRACK NOTES.
C. Miller piloted two winners.
Sun Rose, winner of the second race, >
was bid up from $500 to $600 by Jeff
Wells. The stable retained the filly.

DO YOU WANT TO BE STRONG?
To feel as vigorous as you were before you wasted your
strength ? To enjoy life again ? To get up in the morn-
ing refreshed by sleep and not more tired than when you *
went to bed? To haxe no weakness in the back, or
"come-and-go"' pains? No Indigestion or Constipation?
To know that your strength is not slipping away? To
once more have bright eyes, healthy color in your cheeks
and be confident that what other men can do is not im-
possible to you? In short, do you want to be a man
among men?

ating, nothing that will relieve weakness and pain as
speedily and surely as Dr. McLaughlin's Electric Belt.
It is simple, but grand It assists nature by a general
reinforcement of the vital energy by infusing a mild, in-
vigorating current of Electricity into the nerves and by
supplying the system with the very essence of nerve
vigor and nerve strength.

WHITE COMES
UNEXPECTEDLY
Little Briton and Charley
Mitchell Take the Sports
of the City by Surprise
LOOKS A TEIFLE WORK
Old World Boxej- Allows His
Manager to Do the Talking
While He Does Listening
When Jabez White and Charley
Mitchell sauntered leisurely into Harry
Corbett's last night the sporting fra
ternity was taken by surprise and
every one seemed to be gasping for
wind. England's premier lightweight
had arrived ahead of scheduled time
and consequently there was no brass '
band or glad hand band at the ferry
to extend to him a true California
welcome..
When the news of White's arrival
began to be noised around every one
was on the alert. Corbett's place was â¢
thronged by a motley crowd, each
eager to get a glimpse of the man who
had traveled 4000 miles just for the
satisfaction of putting up his dukes
against Jimmy Britt.
White does not look the part of a
fighter. He is modest of demeanor,
retiring and has the appearance of a
young man who would make a hit in a
Sunday-school. Mitchell is the spokes- |
man and White seems glad to allow
the former heavyweight champion the '
privilege of handing out any elo
quence that is needed.
White is a bit pale in the face and
does not appear to be in any too good
condition. He is 34 years old and looks
every day of his age. His height is
five feet seven inches, his shoulders are
broad and he is built very much on
the greyhound line. He talks with a
pronounced English accent when talk
ing is necessary. He does not use a
slang vocabulary and is very careful
of what he says.
EAGER TO MEET BRITT.
'â¢Yes, you all know just what I am
here for and I fancy the press dis
patches from the East told every
thing," said White. "We had a rough
voyage across the Atlantic and I was
sick during the entire six days. In
fact I am not over my illness yet,
though a few days' rest will put me
right again and I expect to be in the
best of condition after a couDle of
weeks' training.
'â¢I came a long way to fight Britt
and I think I am going to win. I do
not want to be boastful, but I have
confidence in my ability. I have want
ed to box Britt for a long time and
now that the chance has arrived I feer
grateful. I will start in training at
Larkspur right away. I weigh 136
pounds now, but I will probably gain a
little more.
"I have met all comers in England
for the last three years. Generally
they were much heavier than I, but I
managed to beat them all. I have not
taken Dart in a championship event
since I beat "Spike" Sullivan three
years ago. There Is nobody of my
weight left in England whom I can
box, so I simply had to come here to
get a match."
Charley Mitchell seemed to be glad
to be back in San Francisco again.
The last time he was here was in 1886,
when he beat Cleary. He looks as
young as he did then, though he has
grown a bit stout. Mitchell says White
is the greatest lightweight boxer in
the world and feels sure he can beat
Britt.
NO SECRET TRAINING.
"That talk of our wanting to train
in private is all nonsense," said
Mitchell. "We will admit our friends
and the newspaper men to the train
ing quarters, but we will not let in
every Tom, Dick and Harry who
comes along:. We do not want to be
disturbed by bothersome crowds, but
the people will know how White is
progressing from the press accounts."
Mitchell brings his son, Char.es Jr..
with him to help train White. Young
Mitchell is a sturdy chap, built on
the athletic plan. He has been at
tending school near Buffalo. He will
don the mitts with White and help
get the English champion into con
dition.
Manager Jimmy Coffroth of the
Yosemite Club announced last night
that he would bring White and Britt
together this afternoon at his office
to sign articles for the fight. White
will attend the Hart-Johnson mlxup
at Woodward's Pavilion this evening,
but vows he will not come through
with a speech.
Tom O'Rourke did not accompany
White to this city. However, the
noted manager and trainer will arrive
within a week to look out for the
British*. O'Rourke will take charge
ol the training camp, while Mitchell
will be the manager and do the en
gineering and general outside work.
WhUe will probably pick up some
local boxers to help him along with
the work of getting into condition.

against Marvin Hart, the big Ken
tuckian. Both men are trained to the
minute, and a fast battle is looked for.
The sports favor Johnson in the bet
ting. Last night the price was 10 to 4
in favor of th-? big colored man, and
there did not seem to be a whole lot
of Hart money in sight at that. It was
2 to 1 during the day, but the price
dropped a point when night came. It
is believed the men will enter the ring
at the present odds.
Hart never fought in this city be
fore, so the sports have not had a
chance to get a line on his work. He
is said to be one of those fighters who
keeps coming all the time and is al
ways willing to mix it at a merry clip.
Ha wants to knock Johnson out, and
it is certain he will go after the black
boy- at the tap of the bell.
Johnson will In all probability use
his cleverness and ring generalship on
his husky opponent. Johnson is one
of the cleverest, big men who ever pull
ed on a mitt, and he can hold an op
ponent at bay in grand style. If he
takes it into his head to go in and mix
it witb Hart a bruising figrht is sure
to result.
If Hart wins the battle and makes
any kind of a showing it is about set
tled he wi!l be matched with Jeffries.
On the other hand, should he lose the
fight, his ambition to shine as a star
will have flown forever. He is anxious
to get after the big fellow and for that
reason he will probably put up the fight
of his life when he steps into the ring 1
to-night.
Johnson is a]Â«o. after the champ, and
should he beat Hart viuickly and de
cisively there is a possible chance that
Jeff may take him on, though he vows
and declares he will not. Johnson fig
ures on winning quickly and showing
beyond a doubt that he is Hart's mas
ter. Alex Greggains will referee the
flght.
Battling Nelson will be there to make
a short speech, as will Jimmy Britt and
Jabez While. A merry old time is ex
pected when the trio are introduced.
Britt will furely have a few remarks to
make, but White says he will not In
dulge in any eloquence.
Two fast preliminaries have been ar
ranged. Fred Landers and Toby Irwin
will hook up for a ten-round go, while
Jim Hayward, the clever colored boxer,
will go against Young Mitchell, a Sac
ramento man, in a six-round set-to.

FRIDAY NIGHT
Forest, Fish and Game Show
Promises to Be One of
the Events of the Year
PAVILION TKAX*R>K3iEI>
Professor Van der Nailleu
Arranges an Electrical
Display of Great Beauty
Behind the big drop curtain and the
leaping waterfall in Mechanics' Pavilion,
in a space by itself in the balcony will
be the only departure from the outdoor
effect during the coming nature show
of the Forest, Fish and Game Asso
ciation. The idea of a society midway
wu advanced by A. Van der Naillen Jr.
and he was given full power to place
such shows as he deemed best in the
space allotted. He promises a be
wildering array of illusions for the de
lection of the spectators and a couple
of hours spent along the indoor "Pike "
will not be regretted because the dis
plays are ail to be of high class and
conducted on a kid glove plan.
Neatly uniformed young women will
act as attendants and a different soci
ety man will act as "spieler" each
night. Mr. Van der Naillen will open
the show himself on social night with
a line of alluring talk about the won
ders to be viewed beyond the outer
portals. A society midway in a forest
is a novel plan, but for that matter the
whole affair is novel and will be to
tally unlike anything that California
has seen previously.
In order to advance the educational
powers of the exhibition the associa
tion has made special arrangements for
the care of children on Saturdays be
tween 10 a. m. and 1 p. m. The United
j Railroads has agreed to carry th->
youngsters for one fare the round trip
and admission has been reduced to t't
! cents. To still further increase the
: scope of nature study the same rate
! will be made to classes accompanied by
their teachers on special days to be de
termined upon by the Board of Educa-
I tic- Saturday, April 9, will find the
â¢ different orphanages provided for. more
i than 1000 free tickets being given for
I the occasion. During these children's
i entertainments the Foresters' Juvenile
I Band will furnish music, the services
I having been donated.
On the last three days of the show
the State Horticultural Society will
join hands and give its beautiful ex
hibit in the pavilion Instead of in the
ferry nave, whe it has formerly at-
I traded so much favorable attention.
SUPERVISORS IN DEADLOCK
OX PERMIT APPLICATION'S
Morris Levy Fails hi His Effort to
Secure the Plum for Next
Month.
The preliminary skirmish in th*
battle between the Yosemite Club an<l
the Haves Valley Club over the April
professional boxing permit occurred
yesterday when the Board of Super
visors by a tie vote defeated a resolu
tion jrranting the privilege to the last
named club. The resolution was in
troduced by Supervisor Hocks and
wai opposed by Chairman Boxton of
the Police Committee, who stated that
the resolution had not as yet been
considered tn committee. Boston's
motion to refer the resolution to the
committee was lost and the vote on
Its adoption was aa follows:
Ayes â Booth, Brandenstein, Braun
hart. Comte. D'Ancona, Eggers.
Hocks, Payot â 8.
Noes^ â Alpers. BÂ«nt, Boxton. Gal
lagher, Lunstedt, McClellan, Rock.
Sanderson â 8.
Excused. Rea â 1.
The Yosemite Club had filed an ap
plication for the April permit to bring
off the Britt-White contest, and the
application will be considered by thÂ«
Police Committee at Thursday's meet
ing. As Boxton and McClellan voted
asrainst the Hayes Valley Club resolu
tion, they, as members of the Police
Committee, will in all likelihood
recommend that the Yosemite Club be
granted the permit, and the fight will
be on again at next Monday's meeting
of the board.
Amateur boxing permits were
granted to the Hawthorne Club for
April 23, Lincoln Club for April IS
and Hayes Valley Club for April 14.

KILLS CHILD
AND HIMSELF
Gambler Commits Suicide
After Slaying Daughter
and Crushing Wife's Skull
RENO, New. March 27. â Zachariah
Hamilton of Hawthorne, Nev., crushed
the skulls of his wife and seven-year
old daughter as they lay in their bed
in a local hotel here last night and
then blew out his own brains. The
little girl died this morning, but the
wife Is still living and may recover.
Losses at gambling and the fact
that he and his wife were estranged, it
is said, caused the crime. The Ham
iltons came to Reno from San Jose.
Cal., where they were prominently
connected.

ENDS ARGUMENT
WITH A KNIFE
Printer's "Devil" Wounds
Three Boys With Whom He
Had Dispute About Schools
STOCKTON. March 27. â Roy Da
vis, a youthful printing office employe,
is under arrest for stabbing three
youths of about his own age. The
quartet had an argument last night
regarding the relative merits of
schools, Davis claiming that he could
learn more in a printing office than
the others could in a school. A fight
followed, Davis being worsted. He
went home, armed himself with a
knife and returned. Another fight en
sued, during which Davis cut each of
the others.
Clarence Edwards was cut in the
back, the knife narrowly mrssing his
lung?: George Kenyon was cut over
the heart, but not dangerously, and
Harry Harkins received only a slight
wound. None of the wounds Is re
garded as very dangerous.

GRANDEST MARINE VIEW LOTS IN

! Sutro Heights Addition Is the connecting
link between the Golden Gate Park and Sutro !
Heights.
It comprises seven blocks between Fulton T
: street and Sutro Heights avenue. 46th and 49th
I avenues, an 1 Is surely the most unique tract I
of land ever offered in subdivisions.
This Is the only property adjacent to the :
j ocean and Golden Gate Park where streets are j

i SEWER. WATER AND GAS MAINS LAID. '
Grand marine view property In all the
I city: no other city in the United States or
! perhaps In the world affords residence sites I
i with such elevation, unobstructed marine and j
I scenic ! views, and so close to the pleasure i
1 grounds of the people.' It faces the Golden i
Gate Park. â¢ thÂ« ocean, and adjoins* Sutro |
! Heights. Sutro Bath* and Cliff House.
This is not the marine view advertised so !
! indiscriminatelyâ * marine view .at a great :
i distance, a mile or two off. but It is the i
I grandest marine . view of the ocean, only a
few hundred feet from your lot. You have it 1
1 right in front of you, you can . see and hear i
I the rolling and roaring of the breakers of the ;
! great Pacific.
ALL LARGE LOTSâ 3O- root frontagesâ the ,
special feature of this tract, as It gives oppor- '
! tunity for a better class of residences. Severs â¢ '
I beautiful homes are contracted â  for and will â 
j be In course of construction shortly.
DM you ever realize that there are only a
j few blocks north of Golden Gate Park so near j
I the ocean and that every lot sold means a
i choice lot .. less to be had and makes yours
more valuable?
Buy one of those lots for a home, â

â  NEW YOTJK. March 27.â An extraordinary
Flay of quotations in a large numb*-; of low
gra<?Â« mistrials and specialties kept up some
afrpear anee 'of etrprutth for the. . greater part
of tft-day"* pension of the Stock Exchange and
*er\fd tr> disiruise the realizing that was going

k'pt allt-e "wet â¢â¢ <Â»Â»k on the midweek decline
Â«-af a' heral<J of the strong resumption of the
advance.
There was a generally strong expectation
among professional operator* that th* dubious
pr-ints In the speculative ' slttiation had b*en
forced ir.to (he background by last week's
df-rr.onstrs.Uon of the resisting power of the
market.. The halting tendency which developed
In the eourxe- of the day's trading- was not
Â«-lcarly tra"Â«-ab!e to any change in conditions
or outlook. But the disinclination to -follow up
last Â«Kk't recovery vrith further large buy
init was very clearty denned. The miscellane
ous collection of stocks which shot up from
time to time while efforts were making to hold
the market. wfre not the subject of any Infor
mation *ith*r special or general to account for
the movement. The absence of explanation
and the lack of any common ground of In
terest between them were the cause of boitw
â¦â uyplcion of the movement. A list of 25 to 30 -
mijsht be complied, many* of which rarely ap
rxar In the transactions, which were lifted from

filven to the money outlook as the factor

renewal cf . lean for gold on the part of
Paris, which came into force in London on
Saturday. Is ranted as significant and modi
fies considerably the prospects in the exchange
irsarkrt. Any t^r.dency for gold to move to
-N>w York from London would be restrained by
en extended demand from Paris. An intimation
r-ejne Irtm Washington also that further calls j
for the withdrawal cf â  Government deposits '
might h* expected to the extent of $15,000 000 ]
to ?20.000.(XK> as opportunity might offer, with
out likelihood of harm to the business Inter
ests of the country, this measure being consid
ered desirable to be completed before a possible
money Btringoncy In the fall. The tone of for
*i{rn raarkctÂ« was regarded as renewing the
4"oubt? of peao* which vu fÂ«lt to be 'im
minent last we*k. A bad effect was produced
by the decidedly weak showing of net earn
ings for February pruiented by AtrhiÃon. the I
ri-et-itne in gross earnings being aggravated by
a rise lr. operating expenses so as to Induce
and decrease In net earnings for the month of
5K14.000. or more than 42 per cent. Reports
of raiiroa-I traffic generally continued highly
<-neouraÃirjt en the part of the railroad offi
cials, offerings cf ail classes continuing large,
whilo favorable weather conditions enable the
handling of the business at lowest possible cost
of operation. Stocks, however, showed in.
rr*&3lng niKns of weakness as the day pro
pressed, and closed at practically the lowest of
th* day. Union Pacific's decline ran to three
points, and many other standard stocks, fell
from one to two points.

. t u lire Grain and Provisions. ':
j CHICAGO, â  March 27. â Favorable- weather
for the growing crop was 'the main factor -in
a weak wheat market here to-day. At the
close- May and July.; options ; were Â»' off %c.
Weakness prevailed in the wheat pit through
out the â¢ entire session, s i Influenced .by lower
prices at Liverpool, thÂ« **' market â  here opened i
weak,; July being off .%@"ici to %,@*ic' at
t>O%c to Â»o%c. May was down "4Â®"^c to
$1 1314. The principal reason for the weak- :
ness 'of foreign grain " markets was s found sin !
numerous' advices from. America, - the | great I
majority of which . told of - excellent progress
being made, by the fall-sown crop. â  Soqji after 'â 
the opening a fair demand for May developed,
shorts being the best buyers. â¢ - With small
offerings the price advanced to $1 13%.,; In
sympathy, July sold up to 80% c- A report i
from Kansas City stating that high winds .In
Kansas were creating some Apprehension had
considerable influence in starting this | slight
up-turn. With this one ' exception, news of
the day contained - little . comfort.- for bull
traders. Many advices were - received , giving
optimlstlo reports of the : condition of j winter
wheat. S They were reinforced by news Â« from
the Northwest telling of .the beginning of seed
ing operations in that section. - In addition
cash markets were dull, and easy. - Late in.
the day July declined ,to BS*4<j and May to
$1 124. The market closed at almost the low
est point, with July at 89%@900. May closed
at $1 12H--
Liberal .receipts brought out liberal selling
of corn by cash houses, . resulting in a weak
undertone. Shorts were . the I principal buyers.
May closed at 48%@48%0. - ... Â ' .
The oat market was weak. May closed at
30"Â£c. Local receipts were 389 cars. .
A decline of 5c in hog prices 'bad a depress
ing effect on provisions early In the day, but
the market soon became quite steady. on cover
ing by shorts. At the close pork was a shade
higher. Lard and . ribs were each unchanged.

': Butter. Cheese and Eggs.
Receipts of Butter were large again yester
day. I but i the ' market held up. being sustained I
largely by continued orders for the north. But
a weakening factor appeared in the form of ' a
diversion of the San Joaquin Valley-creameries
to this . market owing to. a decline at Los An
geles. ' which usually ; takes the San Joaquin '
product. Dealers rather look for lower price* '
unless the \ northern orders prove sufficient .to
offset this . Influx from the San Joaquin. The
best demand at present la for second-grade
good?.- which are moving off very well.
i Cheese continued steady at previous prices.- 1
The Egg market opened the week lower, with :
continued urgency 'to sell shown by holders and

EDNA WALLACE HOPPER
SCORES A BIG VICTORY
Dunsmuir Millions Near Her Grasp
Coffey Annuls For
mer Proceedings
in His Court.
GIVES REASON
Says Original Will
Should Have Been
Filed Here.
I s ; The. first 'skirmish in the .local court*
s over the millions of the late "Alexander
Dunsmuir has resulted in a significant
victory of Edna Wallace Hopper, the
petite and talented stepdaughter of the
deceased. Judge J. V. Coffey of the
probate department of the Superior
vjourt STanted the prayer of Mrs. Hop
per that all proceedings taken in the
courts of San Francisco in May, 1900,
be declared null and void, the prayer
being based on the contention that this
proceedings were void upon their face,
inasmuch as a. copy of the decedent's
last will and testament, instead of the
original instrument, formed the basis
thereof. The original will in question
"as carried to Victoria, B. C, and
*<?re filed for probate by James Duns
muir, brother of decedent and sole de- ,
visee of his estate. Under Judge Cof
fey/s' decision . .of .. : yesterday this .will
, muet now be taken -from ' the records
6t the British Columbia courts and filed
in this city for probate as was so stren
uously contended for by J. C. Camp
bell, Mrs.. Hopper's counsel-in-chief.
On its face it would appear that such
action in â¢ itself is radical or of far
reaching effect, but -appearances - are
deceptive. The fact is that the filing
of the original will in this city will en
able Mr?. Hopper to Institute a contest
under the more favorable laws of Cal
ifornia and the ultimate disposi
tion of the estate will be here deter
mined. The portion of the estate claim
ed by Mrs. Hopper Is that which would
fall to her mother, : Mrs. Josephine
Dunsmuir. late widow of the maker of
> the contested will.
FAR-REACHIXG EFFECT.
Judge Coffey's appreciation of . the
far-reaching effect of "his decision is
made plain by him. In acting upon the
case he was unguided by precedent, and
this fact made him reluctant to proceed
as he did, considering the fact that
ni6 ruling would make it possible for
other estates involving millions to .be
brought into litigation on the same
points, proceeding in such estate in
the courts of California heretofore be
ing regarded solely as ancillary. Re
garding this phase of the case. Judge
Coffey says:
Ihe court hae bÂ«e.a reluctant from the first
to a favorable view of a proceeding instituted
c Â»'tÂ«-r years of apparent laches and acquies
cence In an act co solemn ac a formal judg
ment affecting vast property rights, but where
*uch 1 Judgment or order is void upon its face
it doe* not appear that In California there
Â is ' any time limit within . which -such a mo-
Tkm^may be sustained. Our Supreme Court has
- <lecio*d that a judgment void upon Its face may
', fee vÂ«<_*ted at any time upon motion, and this
. fmi to be men a case.
The suggest lor. 01 counsel for opponent that
in tbÂ« case at bar the party aggrieved should
have tecourse to a Mil in equity as the only
spprcpriate remedy is not tenable, if this mo- :
c tv>t> bt well based, for here, where the error
: *vhs committed, it should be corrected, and the
complainant should not be remitted to another
Bforum8 forum while relief may be had in probate.
RESIDED in THIS city.
The entire weight of the point
raised by. .Edna . Wallace Hopper to
transfer the probate proceedings from
British Columbia to this city rested on
Â the point as to whether or not the le
gal residence of the late Alexander
Dunsmuir was in this city. Attorneys
for James â  Dunsmuir contended that
California was " not the recidence of
tbf; deceased and that he â¢ never â¢ con
sidered it to be his legal place of dom
iÂ«-ile. Judge â¢ Coftey. however, finds

I the copy was made, that' 1 the 'original'
I had been duly probated by. the V"ic|o- I
j ria court, was the juderment roll of the j

Judge Coffey the. : attorneys for James;

tion of the local court was equivalent j
to the "solemn form", under Brit- '

CALIFORNIA HOLDINGS.
Judge Coffey holds differently, how
ever. He first points to the fact that
Alexander . Dunsmuir died in New
York on April 1900. and in his tes
tament stated that- the value of â *â  his
holdings in California amounted to.
$164,000. He described . himself as a
resident of California,, which fact is
noted by ' Judge ] Coffey, â¢ and set forth j
that his widow, Josephine D. Duns- \
muir, was living at San Leandro and
his mother and brother at Victoria. In
1 support of his findings and conclusions'
of law Judge Coffey goes on to say: .
It appears that â  the testator "was domiciled !
here Instead â¢of abroad :at ' the Minis -of his i
death, and in such .cases there should have ]
been original probate In the -domiciliary form,
which is ; the . principal, .-. primary, original or
chief administration, . because the. laws of the:
1 domciie govern .the.. distribution of the per
bo.ia I property, while â¢ that * granted in any
Other country Is ancillary or auXilfary." It is
.true the descriptive -~> words are -not ' I cund in
our statutes, but the principles are there with
; local limitations." ." ' â¢â¢ .':. ,-'â â '*. â 
Attorneys for James Dunsmuir argued that '
i although the papers said hr was a "resident of.
1 California." that did not. mean be was V'domi- '
1 cilf-d" here. This distinction, although ingeni-
I ously elaborated .by counsel for proponent, is

WITTMAN WILL PROBABLY
CONTFST BOARD'S ACTION
Has Several Grounds on Which to
Bring Suit in the
Courts.
. It was reported yesterday that
George W. Wittman will probably
begin suit in the courts to contest the
action of the Police Commissioners in
dismUsing him from the command of
the department. If the appeal to the
courts is made it will be on several
grounds. One of them will.be that
the board proceeded illegally when it
suspended him pending the hearing on
the charges, the charter, it being con
tended, investing it with no such au
thority. Another ground is that the
trial before the commission was not
"fair and impartial."
It is contended that Commissioner
Reagan's animus was evident.- from,
the beginning .of - the hearing. It is
maintained that he was at all times
exerting himself to make out his case
and on one occasion referred in open
session to the testimony of one of the
witnesses for the defendant as a "fairy
tale." Tho bitterness engendered in
the Commissioner because Wittman
refused to make young Reagan a de
tective will be referred to to show
strong feeling of enmity.

"Dr. Murray stated: When 1 had
hold of her wrist I noticed the position
the was in distinctly. The hands were
firmly clenched in her lap, the thumbs
in the palms, the knees were well apart,
the soles of the feet turned up and the
feet were very much arched; the pupils
were very much dilated and the eyes
bulging.'
"Dr. Humphris stated: '(1) Mrs.
Stanford then told me that she had
been thrown out of bed by a spasm.
BODY WAS RIGID.
"(2) She had just got it (meaning
some medicine) to her lips, when she
said: "My jaws are stiff." I felt them,
and they were. I took the glass from
her hand. She then said: "It is a hor
rible death to die," and immediately
became totally riirid. respiration stop- j
pins- She never breathed again. The :
spasm lasted about three minutes. I
should add that her face was white,
her lips livid.'
"Then the following dialogue ensued:
"Coroner â When she ceased to
breathe and became rigid, just prior to
that, what was the position of her
body?
"Dr. Humphrisâ The feet, the soles
were turned toward each other, in- |
ward â that is to say, the instep was
very much arched and the toe 3 point
ing strongly forward: the knees in the
position of mine now.
"Coroner â What do you say that po
sition was â separated?
"Answer â As widely separated aa
any one's would be sitting on a chair.
Her head was thrown slightly back;
her eyeballs were protruding â prom
inent, I wonld say, more than protrud
ing â her pupils dilated, her Jaws fixed,
her hands â the thumbs were dug into
the palms and the fingers contracted,
like that.
"Dr. Day, on arriving eight minutes
after death, in his testimony says: "I
was impressed with one conspicuous
feature, and that was the rigidity and
position of the feet. The ankle was in
extreme extension â that Is to say, the
toes were thrown down, so that the j
arch of the foot was very much exag- â 
gerated, and drawn inward toward the I
median line â a condition I do not re
call having seen before on any body. 1
DIED IN A SPASM.
"The Coronerâ Was this indicative
>f any cause of deathâ that is, did it
suggest to youâ what?
"l^r. Day â It suggested, of course,
that the patient in all probability died
in a spasm.
"The Coroner â In a spasm?
"Answer â That is a strong contrac
tion of the muscles.
"So much for the sworn statements
of the only persons who were
with Mrs. Stanford in her last mo
ments. And now we will see how they
bear out the characteristics of strych
nine poisoning.
"In the Reference Handbook of
Medical Science. 1904 edition, volume
7, page 543, in the article headed
'Poisoning by Strychnine and Nui
Vomica," the following statements are
made: 'During the spasms there is,
in the majority of cases, marked opis
thotonos. the head is thrown sharply
back, the body bent backward, the
abdominal and thoracic muscles firm
ly contracted, the lower extremities !
risrid, the soles of the feet bent in
ward and strongly arched, the lower
jaw is fixed, the eyeballs are protrud
ing, the pupils dilated, the expression
of the countenance distorted, the lips
cyanotic, the mouth marked with
froth. The spasm gradually passes
off. the muscles relax, the eyes and ,
pupils become normal, the respiration
is resumed, the patient speaks, usually
calls for air. desires to be held and is
in dread of impending death.'

Kerrigan Dissipates Hopes
of Men That Would Care
for Aged Juana Marshall
DENIES ALL PETITIONS
Names Union Trust Company
Guardian of the Old Wo
man's Person and Estate
After a brief hearing yesterday after
noon Judge Kerrigan decided that nonÂ«
of the several applicants for letter* of
guardianship over the person and es
tate of aged Juana Marshall showed aa
great an interest in the personal wel
fare as they did the financial welfare Â«|
the old woman. As a result, the court
rejected all of 4he petitions and
named the Union Trust Company to
care for the aged woman and her es
tate.
Mrs. Marshall came into court lean-
Ing upon the arm of Robert Donahue,
who has resided with her since he was
a lad. It is apparent that her remain
ing days are not many and that time
has dulled her intellect. Her nephew.
Richard D. Marshall, whose petition
for letters of guardianship was on hear
ing, was present with Attorney Tread
well and two assistant counsel. Oppos
ing him was William J. Gray, backed
by Attorneys William D. Easton. Alex
ander Campbell and H. L. Bradford.
John Arzave was also represented by
counsel, as were other* who have ex
pressed great solicitude for Mrs. Mar
shall's welfare.
After listening to the wrangling of
these opposing forces for some time.
Judge Kerrigan impatiently ordered
them to cease their quibbling and di

though she said she came here before
there were any houses. She said, how
ever, that she wanted a power of attor
ney given to Arzave revoked. She de
nied that her nephew had caused her to
sign a will or deeds, but admitted thac
she had given Donohue $1000 with
which to go into business. She denied
that Dr. de Travino had ever been her
physician, but said he frequently called
upon her and she had given him little
presents of money.
Marshall called Chief Spillan* and
Adolph Uhl to prove that his reputa
tion was good, but Judge Kerrigan: did
not care to express any opinion aa to
the merits of the claims of the contest
ants and avoided the necessity by ap
pointing the Union Trust Company her
guardian. The trust company will go
to work Immediately to determine Just
what papers Mrs. Marshall haa signed
during the last few weeks. If she haa
been taken advantage of it will file
action to protect her Interests.
