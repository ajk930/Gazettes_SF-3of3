f-T. PETERSBURG, Oct. 24, 3i46 a.
m. â It mbÂ» persistently reported In the
Â«-lubs and In Governmental circles late
\u25a0t night- that the Emepror yeoterday
had appointed Count IVltte Premier,
viiih the portfolio of Minister of Fi
nance. All the paper* this m.irnfnc;
give prominence to the report.
ST. PETERSBURG. Oct. 23.â Count de
Witte. It now~seems, has definitely come
Into imperial favor, and the shrewdest ob
servers consider it certain that he will
shortly be in active direction of the gov
ernment as Premier and head of a re
sponsible Cabinet position. Since his re
turn from the United States, Count de
Witte has ranged himself on the side of
the Liberals and has not only advocated
compkte liberty of speech, of # the press
and of assembly as a corollary of the
coming Douma. but has urged the exten
sion of the powers of the Douma along
the lines demanded by the reformers, as
well as a broader franchise, so as to ad
mit of fuller representation from the
ranks of labor and the cultured classes.
The Emperor, to whom the Count per
sonally outlined his views, displayed much
sympathy with them, and it is learned
favored a number "of Ministers suggest
ed by thaCcrunt, including- General Trep
oft. Assistant -Minisur of the Interior,
who now ranks as one of the most broad
minded of his Majesty's counselors and
who ig understood to be working har
moniously with Count de Witte.
The question of appointing a Cabinet
with a responsible Premier, to which a
faction in the Ministerial ranks has been
offering stubborn opposition in special
conferneces, is likely to be decided next
Wednesday.
The reception of Countess de Witte by
the Empress to-day is considered a
singular evidence of the Emperor's de
termination to confide his fortunes to the
hands of Count de Witte. No other in
terpretation is placed upon it in court cir
cles, where the reception of the Countess
created a tremendous sensation. Tht
Countess Is a Jewess of ordinary birth,
and had never been received at court.
When M. de Witte was appointed Minis
ter In the nineties, the Emperor was re
ported to have said to him: .
"Remember, you are not married."
The fixing of his wife's social status,
which has been one of Count de Witte's
ambitions, must ranÂ«i as one of the tri
umphs of his life.
The decrease of the influence of the
Grand Dukes perhaps made It easier for
his Majesty to turn to Count de Witte.
The resignation of Grand Duke Vladimir,
the Emperor's uncle, as Commander-in
chief of the military district of St. Pe
tersburg, however, has not yet been ac
cepted. In tendering his resignation the
Grand Duke wrote to the Emperor sub
stantially as follows:
"I have served your grandfather, your
father and yourself; but now that your
Majesty has disgraced my son, I no
longer have the heart to 6erve you."
The Emperor is said to favor even de
prix-ing Grand Duke Cyril of the title of
Grand Dukf. saying that he should be
known simply as "Monsieur Romanoff."

PRIEDRICHSHOFEN, Lake of Con
stance, Oct. 23.â With tenacity of purpose
and dogged perseverance, Count Zeppelin
Is working in quiet retirement in an en
deavor to solve the aerial problem. I
found the Count at the romantic Insel
Hotel. Count Zeppelin said:
"No, I do not intend divulging any of
my secrets at present. You have no idea
how I am worried day by day to give
information, by various people, but I do
not see how any one's,lnterests, especially
my own, would be served thereby, so I
intend remaining silent. I do not think
my air*l..p is going to make an ascent
this year, as the weather is so bad and
the atmosph-tric conditions prevailing
over the lake are so variable at this
time of year. I believe the matter will
have to be postponed until spring. In ad
dition I have had some trouble with the
cylinders of my motor.
"The old motors gave only twenty-four
horsepower, but the new ones can develop
twenty-eight horsepower. The weight oÂ£
the motors themselves is not much more
than that of \u25a0 the old motors, but" the"ex
tra benzine required to work' the;new mo
tors adds considerably, to the. weight of
the -whole concern; therefore, only a' por
tion .ot the extra, power developed can be
regarded as clear gain.
"The future of the balloon will be won
derful. I shall not live to see the time
when airships three or four times the
size of the present ones will sail through
the air, but the larger the airship the
better It can control and navigate cur
rents."
I wended my way toward the little ham
let. Landzell, where I ascertained the fol
lowing particulars: The cost of the struc
ture in which the balloon is housed ex
ceeded 200,000 marks ($50,000); the balloon
Itself, I am informed, is a huge, cigarlike
structure, cylindrical in shape and conical
at both ends. The approximate measure
ments are: Length, 400 feet; diameter, 40
feet ;.--â¢,\u25a0
It looks like a single balloon, but it
is divided into seventeen to twenty gas
tight compartments, like the water-tight
compartments aboard a steamship. The
interior is a massive frame work of alum
inum. All sections are covered with a
tough, light network of ramie. The ex
terior of the airship is made of pegamoid,
which protects it from both sun and rain.
Hydrogen is to be used for filling the
air vessel, each filling. It Is stated, cost-
Ing about 10.000 marks ($2500) and' occupy
ing more than five hours.
COMPELS HIS
GIRL WIFE TO
LEAP INTO SEA
Awful TaJe Is Told by
a Young Seattle
Woman. \
SEATTLE, Oct. 23.â Forced to leap
frona a boat by her drunken husband
and his five companions into the icy
waters of Puget Sound, then to swim
to a barren shore and wander for two
days and nights in the woods without
shelter. Is the story told to-night by
i<j-year-old Mabel Tate, the wife of
Frank Tate, a Seattle saloonkeeper, as
she reported the drowning of the six
men within sight Â»of the lights of Ta
coma on Tuesday morning last. Fri
day the giri, famished and weakened
by her experience, staggered into the
home, of Nelson liutts at Harper sta
l.on, where she relapsed into conscious
ness. -To-day she was able to come to
Seattle. ;
On Monday afternoon last, Tate. she
says, sold out his saloon. Taking his
.money, about $4000, he started for Ta
coma in a small sloop with five Italian
friends, whose names she does . not
know. . The * money Tate placed in a
box in the bottom of the craft. Aboard
was a quantity of liquor. The drunken
men threatened Mrs. Tate and on com
mand of her husband she leaped into
tiie water when the; boat was a "quar
ter of mile from shore. " .
When she was not- more thana hun
dred yards from. the craft, she saysshe
heard Screams and turning her , head,
saw the boat upset and the men strug
gling in: the water. An upturned boat,

and Reorganize in Hope
of Resuming.
The Bank Commissioners declined yes
terday to rescind their action in begin
ning proceedings against the United Bank
and Trust Company, looking toward the
involuntary liquidation of the affairs of
the institution. In a. communication ad
dressed to the stockholders and de
positors, which was prepared 1 by the ad
vice of Deputy Attorney General Sturte
vant, the capital stock of the bank, the
Commissioners declared, was found to be
Impaired to the extent of $17,975 77, which
figure had increased since June 7, 1905.
It was also set forth in the communica
tion that dividends have been paid out
of the capital stock of the corporation;
that moneys of the bank have been il
legally misappropriated; that the books
of the bank show a shortage of $6000 in
bills receivable and .the whereabouts or
status of such bills, was not accounted
for: that the corporation had advertised
that the capital stock paid in was
$212,875, which sum is almost double what
actually has been paid in, and that this
was in violation of the Penal Code; that
the same false statement has repeatedly
been made to the Bank Commissioners by
officers of .the bank;; that in the opinion
.qÂ£ the.. Commissioners the value^of -the
a66e 4f of * he â¢ ba nk' IS \ far less* 1 than Jthe"
face value" of such assets,* and â¢ that the
Impairment of the "capital "stock of the.
bank is. greater than -has been reported.
A Ion?- conference took place yesterday
fotenqon in the rooms of the Bank Com
missioners, at which certain offers were
made by the president, attorneys and in
dividual members of . the committee of
stockholders and deuositors of the bank,
in the hope that the Commissioners would
rescind their action of last week and let
the tank resume. These propositions
were summed up |in , the communication
from the Commissioners as. follows:
OFFERS ARE SUBMITTED.
. "First. That you had the written con
sent of depositors representing fifty odd
thousand dollars to the effect. that~such
deposits might' remain in the bank a rea
sonable length of time. It was further
represented that such agreement was
subject to the understanding that checks
drawn on and prior to Saturday, the twen
ty-first day of October, 'should be ex
cepted from such agreement and should
pay on presentation. It appears that
the deposits so represented amount to
[about fifty (50) per cent of the total de
posits of said bank.
"Second. You further represented that
you had been able to see one hundred
and sixty (160) ' of the four hun
dred and fifty (450) stockholders
in the corporation and that ; the
stockholders seen and interviewed by
you expressed their; willingness to either
take up their promissory notes, or to
surrender the: stock that was Issued in
consideration of- promissory notes and
allow such stock to; be canceled. " ;
"Third. You further represented to
this board that you corporation was will-
Ing to discontinue the branch banks here
tofore started and now, being maintained
by the United Bank and Trust Com
pany." " .
Coupled with this statement was a
declaration by the board that the Com
missioners had made frequent mention to
the reorcFentatives of the United Bank
and Trust Company of certain objection
able features. These were enumerated
I in detail as follows: ;
SAY LAWS WERE VIOLATED.

there is a "shortage ln'excess of six thou

RAILROAD MAGNATE RETURNS FROM FAR EAST
President E. H. Harriman of the Southern Pacific, who arrived here yesterday* says he learned
much during his visit to the Far liast to guide him in bis future business relations with the Orient.
He believes Japan [to^ be ythe. v dominant "factor in the Orient, and says if the United States is to
participate in the future development of trans- Pacific trade it will have to be by co-operation
between its statesmen and* its business men and by close commercial alliance with the Japanese.

consideration. While our visit. â¢ was
solely, for rest" and recreation. 'we were
enabled to learn many,-', things which
will help in. our future relations. These
considerations were extended to us
from all' sides;-- and mainly because we
were Americans representing American

timated that the maximum circulation of
eJlvw dollars has been reached. The total
number of these dollars received annually
at the Treasury offices is about $50,000,- J

It is suggested that provision should

object section 3332 of the Revised Statutes
may be amended to permit holders of de

it will take more tfran promises to satisfy
tbe people of China. Something must be
done, and soon, for it will take very lit
tle breeze to fan the smoldering embers
into a blaze in which America's h&pes of
trade with trade will be very thoroughly
cremated."
Mr. SchwÂ«in says there was no ground
for the report that the Harrimaii party
had been attacked by the rioting mob in
Tokio. The riots were the result of pop
ular resentment against the action of the
police in closing certain public parka.
Schwerin was returning from a dinner
and his rickshaw man collided with _ a
crowd of the rioters. The rickshaw man
tripped and fell and when he regained his
feet talked strong Japanese to the crowd.
"The people laughed and I laughed with
them and the rickshaw man swallowed
his grievance and resumed his shaft?.
That was Â»the sole connection of the Har
rjman paf:y with the Japanese riots."
JAPAN MONEY MAD.
Among the passengers on the Siberia
was Frederick Palmer, who was corre
spondent at the front for Collier's all
through the war, and whose articles on
the stirring scenes at the front have won
for him world-wide fame. Palmer started
for home when the prospect of peace de
veloped into certainty, but before leaving
the Orient investigated the boycott situ
tion under Instructions from his paper.
He agrees with Schwerin that the. Chi
nese are in earnest, and that the situation
is serious. Wu Ting Fang, former Minis
ter from China to Washington, he be
lieves, was the Inspirer of the boycott.
He told the Chinese that the only way to
make America sit up and take notice
was to touch her pocket.. Every meeting
held In this country to consider the boy
cott problem added fuel to the fire. The
cable told of everything done here, and
the report of every' meeting held in the
United States was sent broadcast through
China as evidence of how the boycott
"had got the Yankees going."
Speaking of Japan, Palmer says:
"Japan is money mad. This war taught
her that her great weakness lay in her
poverty, and she is out now to make
money with just as much energy as she
prepared for her fight with Russia. She
wants money, she is going to make it and
will not care who* suffers, so .long as she
gains her end." '
M. Shlraishl. vice president of the Toyo
Klsen Kaisha, was a passenger on the
Siberia. He says that within a little
more than two years the three Japanese
liners now running to this port will be
replaced by two liners, both larger than
the Siberia. The vessels are now being
built In Japan. Within a few months, he
says, the Toyo Kisen Kaisha will be
operating a line of British tramp steam
ers between Japan and Callao. Shiralshi
Js on his way to London.
FLOODED REGION
SEEKS RELIEF
. WASHINGTON. Oct. 23.â The Secretary
of the Interior has received -a petition
from several citizens of the Imperial .Vai
ley In California asking for relief from
the damage done to their property by the
California Development Company, whose
methods of building a drainage canal
throught that region are alleged to have
resulted in the formation of a lake cov
ering 600 square miles and In the loss
through inundation of 25,000 acres of farm
lands.
The California Development Company
was organized in New Jersey in 1896 to
divert the water of the Colorado River
into Mexico and deliver It to settlers on
the public lands In the Colorado Desert,
now known as the Imperial Valley. The
company built a canal from the Colorado
River north of the Mexican boundary
into Mexico, for eleven miles, where it
emptied In/a an old river channel by
which the water thus diverted would re
turn to this country. In 1901 the com
pany began to deliver water, but in 1903
there were many, complaints from the
settlers about the scarcity of water.
The company in 1904 made another canal
at a point about four miles below the
American line. This diversion from the
Colorado TXlver was made without any
controlling works and during the winter
and soring heavy rains washed out the
canals so that 86 per cent of the water
flowed to the valley and 0n1y. 14 per cent
went through the river to the Gulf of
California. It will take at least six
months to Install adequate works to turn
the river back into the old canal.

EX-CONGRESSMAN
JERRY SIMPSON
CALLED BY DEATH
FORMER CONGRESSMAN AND
POPULIST LEADER OF KANSAS.
WHO PASSED AWAY YESTER
DAY.
WICHITA, Kan.. Oct. 2.1. â Former
Congressman Jerry Simpson died at
6:05 o'clock this morning at the St.
Francis Hospital from, aneurism of the
aorta. He had been hovering between
"life and death for ten days. At the
bedside were Mrs. Simpson and their
only child, Lester Simpson of Rosweil,
N. M. The patient was conscious up to
flv^minutes before death.
The ex-Congressman's last illness be
gan at the time of his final campaign
for Congress. In ' spite of failing
health, he continued his business ac- ',
tivity, working as an agent for the .
Defreest-Draper Land' Company of Chi
cago and operating an extensive ranch
near Rosweil. Six months ago his con
dition became such that he went to
Chicago to consult a specialist, who
pronounced his malady hopeless. From
that time on Simpson continued to
grow weaker until finally compelled to
abandon business. He was brought to
the hospital here on September 21.
â¢The Scottish Rite Consistory of
Wichita, of which Simpson had-been a
member, will have charge of the fun
eral. Burial will take place in Wich

WASHINGTON. Oct. 23.â 'The Sage
of Medicine Lodge," as Jerry Simpson
was called, wag In every respect one
of the most unique characters which
adorn the histories of Congress. * He
was swept Into the Fifty-second Con
gress by a wave of Kansas Populism,
charges with the task of reforming th*
whole government. The only advance
information his colleagues had of his
personality was that he wore no socks.
Jerry Simpson, one of the most
unique characters In the national poli
tics since the war, was born in the
province of New Brunswick on March
31, 1842. When he was about six
years old his parents removed to
Oneida County. New Y.ork. where he
obtained all the education that he had.
from the schools.
At the ace of- 14 he became a sailor
and followed . that occupation on the
Great Lakes for twenty-three years
with much success, rising rapidly
through the various grades to captain
and- then" commanding a number of
large vessels.
At the breaking out of the Civil
War Simpson enlisted with the Union
forces in Company. A, Twelfth Illinois
Infantry, but after a time contracted
a disease, which forced him to leave
the service. In' 1878 he moved to Kan
sas and engaged in farming and stock
raising near Medicine Lodge, Barber
County, and In ; time acquired a large
farm there, though he resided In the
â¢town. | . â¢
ENTRANCE IXTO POLITICS.
-He began politics as a Republican,
casting his â¢ first, vote for Abraham
"Lincoln in 1864. After 1880, [however,
he affiliated with the Greenback party,
and later with the Union Labor party,
end still later with the Populists. He
was twice nominated for the StatÂ«
Legislature on an independent ticket
In Barber County, but was defeated
each time -by a small margin. X \u25a0
He became prominent as one of'the
early advocates of a "third party"
movement, believing that there wm no
way to bring about reform in the ;ad- ;
ministration of State or National gov
ernment except by a political force
brought -to bear outside of the two
great existing political parties. -He
took a leading part in the organization
of the People's party in Kansas, which
in 1890 elected five out of seven Con
gressional representatives â he being
one of the numberâ besides the Attor
ney General and 91 of the 125 mem
bers of the State* Legislature. " <
After his election to Congress Simp
son was in great demand to publicly
discuss the principles of "the hew
party, and after many speeches In his
own. State he traveled tnrough'.the
Eastern and Middle States delivering
numerous addresses" to enfhusiasUcTau
dlences, which, resulted ". in the J forma
tion of 'many local organizations. He
became tha idol of his party; and had
he been born .in' the United .States . he
would undoubtedly 'have' received Its
nomination for. 'the Presidency of the
United States. ; "' .:\u25a0\u25a0, -r

make good such impairment
; "That in the opinion of, this board the
value of the assets of said bank is far
Ie;s8 than the face value of such assets
and that -the impairment- of the capital
stock of said bank in fact is now far
greater than as above stated."
APPLICATION* IS DEXIKD.
"This board." continued the-commu
nication to the bank's representatives,
"has very carefully and fully consid
ered your offer and representations,
and after consultation with the Attor
ney General this, board Is advised by
that officer and this board believes that
the conditions surroundingr. the United
Bank and Trust Company are such that
it is the duty of this board to decline
to rescind the action heretofore taken
looking toward the liquidation of the
affairs of said corporation. Your ap
plication must therefore be denied."
This was signed by Commissioners .C.
H. Dunsmoor, Herman Silver, X. Black
stock and Secretary J. Cal Ewlng. j
\u25a0 This ultimatum of .the Commission
ers was delivered at 4 o'clock yestor
day afternoon,' after the Commission
ers had worked for some hours over
the matter. As soon as it was rea^J
the attorneys for â¢ the bank were on
their feet asking' questions ami show
ing: considerable warmth. â¢
Attorney H. G. W. Dlnkelspiel, after-
Bank Commissioner Dunsmpor, aj
chairman of the board, had announced
that the matter was ended so far as
the commission was concerned for the
present â as the board was acting un
der the advice of the Attorney General
and all future action must com*
through the office of the Attorney Gen
eral â immediately called up the Attor
ney General by telephone, and a com
mittee, headed by Attorneys Dlnkei
spiel and Newhouse and President My
ers, started for a conference with Dep
uty Sturtevant. An interview .tho
offices of the Attorney General ensued
that lasted for more than an hour.
The bank's representatives made a
request of Deputy Attorney General
Sturtevant that he would not talk to
the press representatives regarding the
matter that had been discussed at thi3
meeting. To this he consented, but he
talked freely about the general facts
relating to the bank and the causes
that had led the Commissioners to close
the doors of . the United. Bank and
hair and eyes indicative ot brains.
Champ Clark of, Missouri, one of his
fellow members of Congress, said of
him: "Though not a scholar, yet he is
a philosopher of the homely, practical
American type of which Josh Billings,
BillArp and Sam Jones are exemplars,"
In debate he was Imbued with what
Julius Caesar in his "Commentaries"
denominated the "gaudium eertaminis,'
which Sir Walter Scott paraphrased
into
The stern joy which warriors feel
In foemen worthy of their steel.
He was a natural born fighter and
; ranked among the best rough-and
tumble debaters in the House.
Clever in repartee, rich in epigrams,
and merciless in retort. Republican
and Denyjcrat. alike hesitated to arouse
Simpson, for on occasion he would flay
tho one and pound the other, to the de
light of all except the "patient on the
table." He was always certain of ap
plause on such occasions. He served in
all three terms. IS9I-9B and 1897-98.
At the flm and for auite a time
afler he was the butt of every joking
paragrapher in the land, but he after
stood in the small group of men whose
names commanded respect from ocean
to oean.

That Bids for Construction
Are Soon to Be invited
WASHINGTON, Oct. 23.â The Govern
ment of the United States is willing to
enter into contracts with ,- corporation*
or individuals for the construction of any
portion or all of the Panama Canal, i
.This statement was made by. Secretary
Taft to-day while discussing the condt
â¢ tJons upon the Isthmus. Secretary Taft
did not mean to declare' the policy of the
Government in ! the matter of the canal
construction, but to assert that, if it
were found feasible to let contracts, that
course would be pursued. He made,. tbe
following statement:
The question whether the canal will bÂ« built
by contract It is not. of course, possible now
to determine. Mr. Wallace, the former chief
engineer of \u25a0 the canal expressed a. tentative
opinion, that possibly much of the work, ex
cept the Coiebra cut, could be let by contract.
It Is Impossible, however, to make plans fox
this until ih Â» data are obtained, which are now
beln* secured. . - -
I have not discussed the matter with Mr.
Ebonts or with Mr. Stevens, the chief engineer,
because the question has not yet come up
for settlement. - 1 give you only the impres
sion that I received- from conversations witn
Mr. Wallace on the ground. There Is nothing
in the policy thus far pursued which would
prevent the letting of any part of the wors.
by contract, if found to be profitable to thft
Government.
Trust Company and its branches in San
Francisco and Alameda.
STURTEVANT EXPLAINS.
Mr. Sturtevant alleged that the
shortage of $6000 alluded to in answer
made to' the representatives of the
bank by the Bank Commissioners was
caused by the disappearance of prom
issory notes that had been given iii
payment for.. capital. stock, and these
notes had not been found by the ex
pert who" is examining the bank's af
fairs for the. Commissioners.
Concerning the. averment that the re
ported $212,875 of paid up capital stock
is almost double the amount really paid
up, he said that; the promissory notes
were not to be considered as payments,
for the law expressly forbade that
promissory notes should be'aceepted in
payment for capital stock of a bank.
â¢ The charge made by the Bank Com
missioners that . moneys of - the bank
have been misappropriated, he said,
was based upon a discovery that on
one occasion three directors voted- to
pay the president of the bank $2000
for promoting the bank, and that thia
sum was paid to the president; and that
of the throe directors authorizing this
and so voting the president of the bank
was one.
The Deputy Attorney General also ex
plained the statement made by Bank
Commissioners that* thÂ« value of the
assets of the United Bank and Trust
Company is far less, than the face value
of said assets by flaying that the sum
of $50,000 was invested in the bonds of
an abstract company In Oakland, whose
principal : assets _ were.^ '\u25a0â¢ets of books conf
talning reports of the searches of titles
to real estate in Alameda, Contra. Costa
â¢and other counties. One of the members
of the advisory committee of the bank
is prominently connected with this ab- '
stract company. \u0084
Regarding a rumor that criminal prose- !
cutions might follow Mr. Sturt. /ant said
that the office of the. Attorney General
has nothing to do with bringing com- |
plaints. .That rests with the District At
torney. It was alleged in one paragraph

of the document prepared by Mr. Sturte
vant and the Bank Commissioners that
the penal code r haa been violated by ad
vertising that capital stock had been paid
up to the amount of. $212,875, when the
actual amount paid-up In cash was only
about one-half of the . advertised sum.
The statements about the assets, etc,
Mr. Sturtevant said, were based upon re
ports made by the expert employed by
the Bank ! Commissioners to investigate
the condition and methods of the United
Bank and Trust Company.
BANK PEOPLE'S CLAIM.
After- the meetine-with the Bank Com
missioners yesterday aiternoon the people
most prominently ' connected j with the
United Bank and Trust Company de
clared that the decision of many deposi
tors in the bank, who are also among
those who issued promissory notes to pay
for capital stock, to let their deposits
remain and also the offers 'of money from
various sources would put the bank in
shape to pay every dollar due to de
positors to-day, if allowed by the Bank
Commissioners to go an. â¢
Few new facts developed at the lons
meeting of the Bank Commissioners 'and
the United Bank * arid Trust Company
people yesterday forenoon that are not
summarized in the - foregoing. Some of
the statements were repetitions, of what
had been said previously at meetings of
the "bank stockholders and depositors
Saturday and Sunday.., \u0084 ; ' ,' '. ;
Deputy Attorney General* Sturtevant
asked many Questions arid drew several
'statements of more or less interest from
the assembled officers and stockholders,'
who. were present to the. number of
twenty or more. President . Myer a "ex
plained that the bank had once a wo
man's department, but It was discon
tinued because It was unprofitable. Mrs.
Foltz was employed as attorney, and it
was understood that she was to interest
women in the Â«~bewilr**Â«fl- depositors and
stockholders. A women's bankers club
was .organized at which banking topics'
-were discussed.'-. ' \ .'. â¢ : \_ \u25a0\u25a0' R^>"Â«
There was a promotion company under
contract with the bank to sell preferred
stock and also common stock of the
bank, for which service commissions were
paid to the promoters. Then there was
a real estate business formerly connected
with the bank, but that connection was
discontinued. All three companies, the
banking company, the promotion com
pany and the real estate company, oc
cupied and continue to occupy the same
room in the Mills building.
The stockholders and depositors held
I another meetlnK in the assembly ha 1 !
of the Mills building last night. Ths
public was excluded from the meeting,
upon the advice ot the bank's attor
neys, who announced that the pres.*
mlgrht misrepresent the proceedings
and injure their eauie. At the close
of the meeting; Hugo D. Newftouse. one
of the attorney* for the bank, volun
teered to slve a statement of the pro
ceedings to the press.
\u25a0 According to Newhouse. the stock
holders are willing to close ther brancli
banks, both In this city and In A!a
meda. and will call in, the "stock notes '
as rapidly as U deemed feasible. Ee
tween $4000 and $5000 was raised in
cash at the meeting 1 , making tbe '-Dial
amount raised yesterday over $52,f>ijo.
This amount, together with the money
already in hand, gives the bank a caih
surplus of over $10,000 orex the de
posits. The depositors have loanÂ«d tan
bank tn the neighborhood of $60,000.
making:. a total of 1130.000 on hand to
pay the. slo7,ooo which the bank owes.

are just little souvenirs, some were
merely paper flowers, a.nd the intrinsic
value of them all is Insignificant.
"And I will not be interviewed."

value estimated all the way from Sec
retary Taft's appraisement of $150/ to ;
hundreds of . thousands, are going
through to Washington with the rest
of Miss Roosevelt's baggage, in bond.
This course" was suggested by Deputy
Collector Charles Stephens, who re
ceived the travelers as the representa

the duty on the 'things Miss Roosevelt j
brought from the Orient, outside of the]

VISITS IMPERIAL. RULERS.
Probably the most interesting events
of Miss Roosevelt's trip were the visits
Pat Tokio and Peking to the rulers of
Japan and China.* In each cage Miss
Roosevelt and her friends were the
first American women who had 1. been
received, as they were, by the Dowager
Empress of China or by the Mikado.
They were entertained in halls through
la. which never before had'rung the sound
of high heels tapping on polished teak
and in each case were guests ,of figures
filling romantic places in > the' world's
history.
The Dowager Empress they deicribe *
ss -*a woman of seventy who looks un
der fifty, and who was much less inter
ested In us than we were in her."
Wu Ting Fang, the former Chinese
Minister, to Washington, acted as in
terpreter, and none of those who en
joyed the strange old woman's hospi
tality will ever forget either her or her
wonderful palace.
Of the alleged inattention of United
States Minister RockhiU no member of
the party /> would speak. Cruz Herrera,
the president of the municipal council
of Manila, who made insulting refer
ence to the women of America at a
banquet to the Taft party, has resigned,
and Miss Roosevelt and her friends are
willing to forget him.
On the tug Arabs, which met the Si
beria in quarantine, was Chauncey SL
St. John, deputy surveyor of the port.
Mr. St. John was there to greet his
cousin. Miss Mabel Boardman, who ac
companied Miss Roosevelt on her trav
els.
In Miss Roosevelt's party were: Sen
ator and Mrs. Newlands. Senator F. E.
Warren and son. Hon. E. Godchaux and
wife. Mlsa Mabel Boardman. Miss Amy
McMillan, Congressman N. Longworth
and Captain Crosby.
STEAMER HAS TO WAIT.
â¢ Miss Roosevelt left here July 8 on the
liner Manchuria. She looked weary with"
the burden of continuous entertainment
when she boarded, the big steamship, but
with the diplomacy of a seasoned poli
tician had a gracious smile for every
body and - apt . responses for greetings,
from acquaintance and stranger. Some
merely wanted a look at the first young
woman in the land, others wanted to
shake hands and wish her a pleasant
time, while others insisted on telling her
how much they admired her respected
father. It was weary work, but she went
through it like a veteran, and when the
liner sailed she left on the wharf a vast
multitude, every unit of which. was say
ing to his or her neighbor, "She's all
right."
The weariness was all" gone by the time
the Manchuria reached Honolulu,; where
Miss Roosevelt had the time of her life.
While at the island port . she was j intro
duced to the delights of surf-riding, and
the new sport pleased her so well that
had she been' anybody else the Manchuria
would have gone away without her. She
overstayed her "liberty" until after the
liner had left the wharf and the big ship
. had to wait until Miss r Roosevelt arrived
alongside on a Government tug. * *
She arrived at Yokohama July 25 and
was given an enthusiastic welcome. At
Toklo she was entertained like a- Prin
cess royal.
The army transport Logan carried
the President's daughter to the Philip
pines, where Miss' Roosevelt saw every
thing- worth seeing. . Many provinces
were visited, and -wherever she wen*
; the President's daughter: was warmly '
! received and royally entertained. j

VAST CROWD ASSEMBLES.
The stand was erected on Bienville

gling crowd of citizens. It was brilliant
with electric" lights "and overhead r the
magnificent grove of live oaks formed
a canopy of green. It is estimated that

he arose to speak. , : He thanked the
people for their; magnificent reception

the Confederate -veterans, who? formed
a portion of his escort. : He, referred' to
the- fact that one of his uncles was ; on
the Alabama during, the Civil War. ;
Referring ,to ; the ! Panama " canal, the
President said jhe did his best* to bring
about its completion for the' benefit of
the whole people, but particularly for
the benefit of. the Gulf v States. V Orig
inally,' he said, he favored the Nicar
agua route, but when it was demon
strated that it must be; the Panama
canal or nothing, he 'favored the Pan

built, and one' will be. built. ' Notwith
standing the efforts of; certain people
who are strlving!by their.clrculation of
false rumors or other methods to de
lay or defeat the construction, of the
canal, the' President said, they would
be disappointed, f.or' there Is going , to
be* a ; canal/ Health conditions on the
isthmus, heVsaid,:are ? than ; ever
before. The President continued: /;/
If we ' build the - canal .'we - must protect -it

Special. Dispatch to The Call.
PITTSBURG," Oct. 23.â John .B. Cun
ningham, receiver of the Enterprise Na
tional Bank of -.Allegheny, Pa.', has dis
covered that notes for about $600,000. held
by that bank for money lent by T. Lee
Clark, ; the cashier, who committed sui
cide, are missing. Whether/these, notes
were destroyed or whether; no notes were
taken for loans, Cunningham does not
know, but he is of the opinion* that they
were destroyed or taken from the bank.
These notes, the "directors of the bank
suspect, contain the; names of politicians.
From what has been learned from Clark's
past, It appears that he had no system of
recording loans, much less of Informing
his directors about "them I and getting
their ' approval of the securities.
William A. Seidling, a director, to-day
said the .directors had , learned several
weeks ago that the bank had notes signed
by State politicians, among them. It Is
said, one signed by United States Sena
tor Penrose. Clark, however, had denied
that", he had any â¢ obligations containing
Penrose's signature.- Some of the direc
tors believe they will find these notes
were destroyed by Clark when he de
cided sto take his life to shield his name
and his friends. 'â¢ \u25a0'..\u25a0\u25a0 â¢
On -the application' of two stockholders
in the National Cable and Wire Com
pany, the corporation of which Clark, was
president, ; a receiver was appointed to
day for that concern. The company, was
organized with a capital stock of $10,000,
which" subsequently was increased to
$500,000, half of which was preferred. Pre
ferred stock to the value of $154,000 is out-"
standing. The company, makes insulated
wire for, the transmission of; electricity,
and last year did a business amounting
to about $50,000. /By reason of Clark's
suicide, the bill . relates, calls have been
made -for demand loans amounting to
$15,000, \u25a0 which I the Â» company is unable to
meet. The | receiver,; will operate the plant.
Fred G winner, president of the defunct
Enterprise National t Bank," when asked
to-day ' what "the j shortage of j the Enter
prise would amount to, said: T*
."It will be/very large; ; much larger,. ln
fact, than we first supposed. ; From -what
I know now, it will :reach $1,500,000. None
of the' directors or officers, not even my
self, had any idea that it would reach
such an enormous sum as that. The di
rectors have determined, , however, that/
no matter how great the shortage, it will
be paid and the bank" will . reopen for
business. We hope that before 'â¢ a month
elapses it will be in operation and will
eventually hold up its head arid occupy
the proud position that it formerly com
manded." r

PACKERS SEEK
A NEW ESCAPE
Allege That the Points Now
Raised, Against Them Have
* Already Been Disposed Of
SPECIAL PLEA ENTERED
State - That the Injunction
Issued by Judge Grosscup
Covered the Entire Case
CHICAGO, Oct. 23.â Declaring that the
testimony the packers were compelled to
produce before ;the Secretary of ' Com
merce and ; Labor . was ~ used by United
States District Attorney Morrison in ob
taining an Indictment against them and
alleging ' that inasmuch as the same is
sues as mentioned In the Indictment were
raised : and disposed of In an injunction
. writ issued by Federal Judge Grosscup,
the packers " who are under Federal ' In
dictment here ' charged with Illegal con
spiracy to-day again attacked the famous
, so-called "beef trust', process.
, A special plea In bar was filed by coun
sel for the packers. The nature of the
special plea was a surprise to the Gov
ernment officials, although they were
aware of what .would be pleaded In the
additional " plea, the Issuance of an In
junction by Judge Grosscup. The special
plea 'sets up assertions concerning in
vestigations by the Commissioner of Cor
porations and alleges that the defendants
were . compelled to \u25a0 . testify and to pro
duce certain books and other . data and
that thereafter the matter was submitted
to the President of the United States and
finally to the United States District Attor
ney here, and that the District Attorney
used the material in seeking indictments
against the defendants. I Because of these
alleged f act 3 the defendants ask that the
indictment be dismissed. /
Regarding the Grosscup injunction the
plea to-day maintains that by the prose
cution of the injunction and the entry of
a final decree by the Supreme Court "the
said United States of America did finally
and fully elect to pursue that remedy and
not -to prosecute these defendants re
spectively for or on account of the said
supposed engaging In the supposed con
spiracies which Is in said indictment
mentioned, or any or either of them."
The special plea concludes with the fol
lowing statement: '
And this defendant avers and submits that
under and by the laws of the -United States,
because of the premises aforesaid, this de
fendant cannot be 'prosecuted or subjected to
any penalty or forfeiture for" or on account
of the respective , transactions, matters or
things or any or either of them, which arr
in said indictment or any count thereof In
that behalf mentioned and charged against
this defendant In manner and form as same
are in said Indictment and respective count*
thereof charged against the defendant.
Wherefore be prays Judgment and that bj
the court he may be dismissed and discharged
from said premises in said Indictment and
express ' count thereof specified.
Samuel McÃobert, agent for Armour &
Co., filed a separate special plea. In which
he seeks -<\u25a0 Immunity because; he testified
before the Grand Jury, which afterward
returned an Indictment against him. Un
der a : Federal statute, it is alleged, no
person shall 'be prosecuted in the case
In which he . testified' If 'he is compelled
to testify, against himself. This plea is
held to' be good by ' many, and, although
it will be vigorously attacked by the
Government, it is' declared there is .a
likelihood of the quashing of* the indict
ment In the'ease of McÃobert. The other
pleas' 1 are hot held to be of great im
portance '"â by \ the" Government. District
Attorney. Morrison - has _\u25a0 not yet decided
what action to take' in regard to them.

Ours was, a busy store yesterday and
far Into the night. Many came only to
look, thinking that our club plan was
but a fake of some kind. But when
they saw the elegant Instruments, tried
them out and inspected their Interior
mechanism, without exception admitted
it to be the first time In their attempts
at piano purchasing that the conditions
were exactly as advertised, with no red
tape attached to it.
If you have no piano, or one that is
worn out. come see us at once. You
can surely see the advantages of our
plan.

REDWOOD GIANT
REFUSES TO DIE
UKIAH, Oct. L'3.â A redwood tree
that refuses to die even after it has
been cut down is a phenomenon that
has been discovered by Frank Brown
6f Philo on his timber claim:-In.select
ing a -tree for cutting into shakes a
few months ago he felled a monarch of
the forest, that was more than 200 feet
tall and about eight feet In diameter at
the base. On returning to the tree re
cently to put 'his shingle crew to work
he was surprised to see several fresh
limbs. Investigation j proved that the
limbs were really, small trees that were
growing out of the fallen monster. Be
side; those- that had already attained
considerable' growth, there were "a
numbeV of others that were Just peep
ing through the bark. ,;
Another peculiarity about the tree; is
that Jthe cut from it have no
sap \in them and are as light as the
thoroughly -seasoned product. ".. This is
the first case on, record where a red
,wood 'completely' severed, 'from, the
stump hias commenced newgrowth, and
the; problem is a puzzler to old woods
men. The tree yielded about 30,000
shakes. ' . â¢ \u25a0 \u25a0' \u25a0'.

Little Agnes Wright Swal
lows Acid in Bitterness
of Despair.
The girlish brain of Agnes Wright of '
713 Minna street evolved the idea that
suicide was the proper cure for her hurt |
feelings, and she swallowed a bottle of
carbolic acid last night at her home. Ow- ;
ing to the Quick work of Dr. Glover at j
the Central Emergency Hospital, her aim
was thwarted and she will recover.
Scarcely years of age and pretty,
Agnes" Wright quarreled with her brother
and was found a few minutes later In her
room writhing on the floor, with the sears
of the acid on. her mouth and face.. Her
brother -says the altercation was a small
one. He asked his sister to come to sup
per. She appeared despondent and re
i plied that she did not want any sup
per. Her brother upbraided her and left
her in her room. The family deny that
there was any cause for the deed, but the
fact that the acid was purchased yester
day afternoon is ominous. A trifling love
affair would perhaps be the most likely
cause of the attempted suicide. A young
man who professed to be her "steady"
hovered near her cot at the hospital last
* night, dispensing kisses and exhibiting
marked affection. The child will recover.

BOY IS DRAGGED
FOR HALF BLOCK
Little George Eickhorst Is
Fatally Injured While
Riding Horse Down a Hill
George Eiekiiorst, a lad. scarcely 10
years of age living at 2931 Pierce
street, was thrown trom a horse yes
terday evening and after being drag
ged, for a half block his skull was so
badly crushed that he died a few hours
later. The fatality happened on De
visadero street, near Filbert, about 4:30
p. m. Special Policeman Otis Berge
was riding on a Union-street car and
witnessed it. He ran to the aid of the
I injured boy and taking the child in his
arms hurried him to the Central Emer-i
gency Hospital. Drs. Glover and Frank
Tillman operated immediately, but the
injury was so great that the b<sy died
about 10 o'clock last night.
Little George Eickhorst begged hia
father for a pony. To satisfy the lad's
craving for'an animal, the father, who
conducts a grocery at Greenwich and
Pierce streets, bought the horse. This
was a month ago. Since that time the
boy. had spent all of his leisure mo
ments on the baejk of his pet. People
in the neighborhood say that young
Eickhorst rode recklessly down the
hills about his home.
No eyewitness to the start of the
fatal runaway could be found. The
general impression and the one offered
i by the father is that the horse slipped
I in going down the Dcvisadero street
hill. Young Eickhorst was thrown
from his saddle. When seen by Special
Policeman Berge, the boy was bound
ing over the rough cobbles, one of his
feet securely held in the stirrup. The
rocks crushed the small skull into an
almost unrecognizable mass. His "body
was a mass of bruises. When Berge
rushed to the injured boy's side, the
lad was unconscious. '-\u25a0â¢\u25a0:Â«"*.*.
F. G. Eickhurst, the father of the
boy, broke down at the. hospital and

Work -That Is Appreciated
"April A\ eather," a Sol 1 Smith Russell
play, was presented very /successfully
by the Alcazar '" stock T' company* last
evening. The "audience showed its
hearty appreciation of- the: production
by cojitinual applause. .The.play runs
alternately grave and gay or "sun
shine" and 'clouds" as the programme
says.
Charles Waldron is the ' Unfortunate
artist who {swerves from the path of
duty for the sake of his love and finally
conquers himself to set things^rlght at
the last moment. Beautiful -Lucia
Moore ably handles the part- of. Mrs.

charmingly filled by-Adele Bclgarde,
who seemed particularly popular .with
the audience. Ncra Rosa, creates all
manner of fun as Maggie Carter and
Lenora . Klrwin in the part of the Bow
ery; girl would make any cross old
business man hold. his sides in ; laugh

Henry Byers is an unqualified success
as Carman, the millionaire. He looks
like ready money anyway. .The others
of the cast contribute generously , to
ward making a success of the play.
Ollie Cooper and Little Martine, par
ticularly, won their ways to the hearts
of the spectators. Next week comes
Pinero's powerful play/^'lris."
Majestic.
"The County Fair," Charles Bar
nard's whimsical comedy, was revived
last night at the Majestic Theater be
fore a large and delighted- audience.
Well staged, capitally, played and* the
author's wit adequately treated there
were moments of merriment. Frank
Bacon as Abigail Pruc lost none of the
character and humor of the part made
famous by Neil Burgess. He was well
supported by Maude Monroe as Taggs.
"The County Fair" will be given this
evening for the benefit of St^ Agnes
Parish.
(.'alifnrnln.
The Star Show Girls, "Alart Singer,
sole owner and' manager," gave- their
opening performance at the California
Theater last night and "made good!"
Singing, dancing and burlesque are
the attractive features, with some
pretty bits of scenery' and gay cos
tumes thrown in as garnishment. There
is no plot, only a string of specialties.
The girls â twelve of 'them â did an ex
cellent drill. Van Brooke-Lambert
played Tobani's "Hearts and
ers" on the violin and scored a hit.
Miss Ten Brooke, his partner, displayed
a sweet voice In her songs.
Central.
Judging from the hearty reception
given by the audience lust night: .to
"The .Girl Engineer" at ;',ttae Central,
that popular, playhouse has a, big draw
ing card for this week. The drama is
based on actual events, that, led .up to
the big strike In this State in 1593. -. It
is a story of a struggle between
a brave engineer and a. villainous su
perintendent for the love of a pretty
girl. Herschcl Mayall was a manly
railroad engineer, while Edna Ellsmere
added to her laurels bya charming im
personation. â¢ Henry Shumer was the
villain, while George P. Webster gave
a finished portrayal of a half-breed In
dian. James Cofrigan. True'Boardman,
George O. Nicholls, Clare Slnclare, Lil
lian Elliott, Charles Edler. Myrtle Sel
wyn and little Baby Myrtle received
hearty applause for clever, 1 acting. The
play . was superbly mounted and the
scene where "the girl engineer" oper
ated the big locomotive brought down
the house In a tumult of applause.
The Cbiiten.
Frank Hayes, the comedian, who
was such a hit at the recent production
of "Rob Roy" at the . Tivoli. had both
audiences in screams of laughter at the
Chutes yesterday, and Browning and
Wally, the sensational aerial perform
ers from the Orpheum, reduplicated
their O'Farrell-street success. The
Kingsburys proved a pleasing comedy
musical duo, Bob Macauley and Fan
nie Donovan had an interesting sketch
and Steve Jennings, Leona Clifton and
the Animatoscopc' completed an excel
lent programme.. The amateurs will all
appear in tights on Thursday night,
and there will be a cake walk at the
Chutes on Saturday evening, after the
regular performance. !

CZAR FACES
NEW CRISIS
Railroad Strike Spreads to
the Factories and May
Soon Place Russia in- a
Position of Helplessness
DEADLOCK REACHED
IN THE SITUATION
Moscow, Commercial Center
of the Country, Isolated,
and a Famine Threatens
the People of the City
ST. PETERSBURG. Oct. 24.-The rail
road strike situation has now entered
on -a highly ' serious phase. The move
ment is spreading rapidly fo all the rail
roads of the empire, and apparently can
not be stopped, while in many cities it
is communicating itself to the mill and
factory employes. The general strike In
all branches of labor which the Socialists
planned for the end of this year is sud
denly bursting forth of its own volition-
Minister of Finance -Kokovsoff yester
day received \u25a0 a telegram from the gov
erning committee of the Moscow Bourse,
which said that . a continuation of the
strike for a week longer would force
every factory in the Moscow region to
shut down owing to lack of coal, whether
or not the factory hands took part in
the strike. - -â¢
The same condition of paralysis threat
ens all the trade and industries of Russia
unless the strike is speedily settled. The
inhabitants of Moscow are already feel
ing the effects of the strike In the in
creased prices of food, and they are even
confronted by famine.
As the demands of the men are purely
political. It seems impossible to satisfy
them by mere economic concessions.
Prince Hilkoff, Minister of Railroads, yes
terday strongly appealed to the Moscow
strikers on the basis of his own experi
ences in England and the United States,
but he spoke to deaf ears. The men
talked of nothing but their political
rights, which, of course, the Prince was
powerless to grant.
The situation is apparently at a dead
lock, from which a change can only be
effected by the surrender of one side . or
perhaps the proclamation of martial law
on the railroads. A flood of dispatches
yÂ«ster<Jay from Simbarsk, Saratoff, Vyaz
ma, Poltava, Nizhni Novgorod, Kharkoff,
Smolensk, Kleff. Elizabethgrad, Kazan
and other railroad centers all over Russia
announced a complete tie-up of all trans
portation.
. The last link that bound Moscow, the
commercial center of the empire, with
the outer world, was broken yesterday
afternoon when the men on the Nicholal
road, connecting Moscow with St. Peters
burg., .wtnt on strike. The engineers shut
off steam in, their engines and Prince Hil
koff had great difficulty in obtaining a
crew. for the special jAoln which brought
him to St. Petersburg^^ midnight.
St. Petersburg has one line to the fron
tier and the employes of this line held a
meeting, late last night. to decide whether
or not they, should participate in the
strike movement.
Brigadier General Thomas 11. Barry and
Captain Sidrrcy A. Cloman of the United
States, who have been with the Russian
army- in Manchuria, left "at night for
Vienna on what was perhaps the last
train out of St. Petersburg. Railroad
trains are now running only in the bor
der regions of the empire:
Pathetic scenes are reported from Mos
cow, where thousands of the poorer In
habitants of the adjoining provinces have
been waiting for four days for trains to
take them home. They are camping out
near the railroad stations and in the
streets and many of them are without
money and the necessities of life. :=<.

in the search for the abductors of Miss
Stone and who also was of great as
sistance to the suffering' Macedonian
refugees. It was said at the time 'that

ST.* PETERSBURG, Oct. 23.âAccord

had considerably in excess of a million
soldiers In the Far East when peace
was declared. About 700,000 men faced
the "Japanese below the Sungari River
in addition to a considerable army held
in reserve at Harbin. The remainder
of this force was partly at Vladivostok
and partly scattered through the pro

Turnen River.
The attaches say that Lieutenant
General Linevitch had brought his army
to a high state of efficiency. They were

would be a match for any In the world.

The Americans do not seem to be

NEWS OF THE COUNTIES ABOUT THE BAY
UNIVERSITY GRADUATE FAVOKS
A STATE THEATER
Elmer Harris Says
It Would Help
the Drama;
He Has Studied the
Endowed Stage
in Europe.
His Own Play Wins
Place of Honor
in Germany.
BERKELEY. Oct. 23.â Klmer Harris, a
graduate of the university, who has just
returned from a tour abroad, where he
studied with such notable actors as Co
quelin, Ellen Terry and others of like
rank, ar.d made a special investigation
of the endowed theaters of Europe, has
put forward a plan for the establishing
of a State theater in California, to be
operated under university auspices, with
money appro; riated by the Legislature.
Harris has won his spurs as a dramat
ist by having his drama. "The Resur- !
rectiGU," chosen from 1200 others for pro
duction at the German National Theater
in Hamburg this winter. The play will
be put on xt the Hamburg Schauepiel
' haus. It was to have been staged in
London, hut the London censor of plays
refused his permission, objecting, it is
ea.id, to the title, and to parts of the
play.
Harris" puggeetion that a State theater
be endowed in California is the result of
a careful study, both of the conditions
und^r which national theaters are con
ducted in Europe and of the situation
in California, so far as the drama is
concerned. He has been promised, the co
operation of the university authorities,
he says, including; President Wheeler, and
is confident .th*i the plan, ambitious
though, it is, will eventually be crowned
\u25a0with puccess.
The sum of jro.ooo may be asked for
from the State legislature at its next
cession, this money to be spent in leasing
a building in San Francisco for -dramatic
productions, engaging instructors, hiring
actors, and in other ways insuring the
production of dramas on a first class
nc-alc for the benefit of the public. Both
education and entertainment would be the
â¢aim.
Professor William Dallam Armes.
through whose efforts the University
Dramatic Association was formed last
year, unifying the dramatic^ activities at
the university, believes Mr. "Harris' plan
to be practicable, and worthy of support
from every section of the State Univer
sity. SJfc. â¢\u25a0\u25a0â¢.â¢\u25a0 â¢ - \u25a0
Harris graduated from the university
in 1901. He was prominent in dramatic
activities in college, and after graduat
ing spent three years in America and
Europe, devoting his time to dramatic af
fairs, with unusual opportunities for
gaining inspiration from great players and
great dramatic directors. Harris said
to-day:
I t'"i;Â«>vÂ» that tha ultimate regeneration of
the drama is to occur through the medium of
theaters controlled by the people, or the peo
ple's representativee. I have been discussing
thli matter with the university authorities dur
ing the last two weeks and believe I have a .
right to be enthusiastic over the support they
are inclined to give the idea. The prospect for
the establishing of a State theater In Califor
nia, I believe, ie excellent. It is the belief of '
the leaders of the drama to-day that the only
way to resuscitate the - antma in America li
through the medium of national or State thesi
tere. In Europe the national theater 1* a great
success In helping to maintain the high stand
ard of the drama.
Sir Henry Irving almost in his last word*
spoke for a nationally endowed theater, and
now Englishmen are contemplating endowing
vuch a theater as a memorial to the grand old
actor.
CARPEXTEB IS KILLED.
BERKELEY. Oct. 23. â Stuart Quack
Â«nbu6h, foreman of. a gang of carpen
ters employed on the Parafflne Paint
Company's building at Shell Mound,
fell this mornlnsr from the roof to the
cement floor below, a distance of forty
feet, and was Instantly killed. His
ekull was crushed and other portions
of his bodr wÂ«Â»re bruised and mangled.
Quackenbush attempted to place a
heavy iron girder into position while
standing on the roof and slipped as he
â¢worked. There were no cleats on the
roof to help him regain his position,
and the fall to the floor was inevitable.
Charles Brown and Lewis Hicks, fel
low workmen, witnessed the accident,
but were powerless to prevent it.
The dead man was 40 years old, a
brother of S. S. Quackenbush. a promi
nent real estate dealer of Berkeley, and
had resided with his wife at Parker
and Telegraph avenues. The body was
removed to the Oakland morgue.

HAND MYSTERY
Attempt on Life of Italian
Is Probably Eesult of
Decree of Dread Society
â¢ .
OAKLAND, Oct. 23.â Despite, the efforts
of the parties concerned to keep the mat
ter quiet, a whispered rumor Is going
the rounds of the Latin colony of Oak
land that the attempt made early this
morning on -the life of S. Malada, who
lives on Whitmore street, was not simply
the outcome of a quarrel at a dance, but
was directed by that dread society, the
Black Hand. Malada, while entertaining
a party of friends at his home, was called
to his door, and a moment later three
shots rang out, and the bullets whistled
about his ears, none, however, reaching
their mark. ' I
Policeman Kyle was in the vicinity, and
hearing the shots, he hurried to the
scene and placed Albert Mandola, an
other Italian whom he found, near the
Bcene," under, arrest. He Is now held at
the City Prison, awaiting the filing of a
charge of assault to. commit murder to
which Malada. says he will swear. Ma-
Jada said to-day that the attempt to
kill him was the outcome of some trouble
at an Italian dance, at "which Mandpla
was thrown out of the hall for creating
a disturbance.
No weapon was found on-Mandola when
he was arrested,and neither has one been
found near the scene of the shotting,
nor at Mandola's home. From this it
apears that. Mandola must have had nn
accomplice who made away with the
plsjtol.. â¢ ,'.:'.<;'
Everything in the case points to, the
idea that the attempt to kill Malada, was
inspired by some more powerful motive
than that told to the police.

telling how Lloyd promised to make
her his wife at Bristol. England, in
1860, and then left her with her little
child and came to 'America. Before he
left, however, he bought her an auto
graph album. and wrote her name in it
and wrote two pieces of poetry, which
were read to. the court.

OAKLAND, CaW Oct. 23.â The City
Council 10-night, sitting as a committee
of the whole, took the first steps toward
acquiring a complete sewer system for

to issue bonds for approximately $350,000
for the purpose and the committee rec
omended that the City Engineer be . di
rected to prepare plans and speciflcations
for the work. â¢ .
In the course of the discussion Council
man Aitkin created a scene by refusing to
vote for any of the items suggested, and
refusing to give any reason for such ac
tion until his attitude was attacked by
several of the Councilmen. Then he ex
plained that he did not wish to vote on
the sewer matters ecause he would do
nothing to jeopardize the bond issue for
a municipal water supply.- In answer to
Thurston, he said he .wotild . vote for a
bond election for sewers if 'the cost would
-not exceed $350,000, and after that each
item, was indorsed unanimously. The
City r Engineer will be erected' to prepare
plans for the following work: 't

COCKRAN TAI KS
OF HAPPINESS
Eminent Orator Says That
Path of Labor Leads to AIL
the Enjoyments of "Life
ADDRESS TO STUDENTS
Declares Riches Count Only
When They Tend to Widen
Usefulness of Individual
OAKLAND, Oct. 23.â W. Bourke Cock
ran oÂ£ New York 'won the hearts of?, the
students of St. Maryls College. this morn
ing, when he- delivered an -.address, and
obtained from President Vellesian a'hol
iday for his youthful admirers. 'He
talked to them earnestly ' for more than
half an hour, pointing out that their only
hope of happiness is in following high
ideals; When he had finished, the ap
plause that followed was interspersed with
cries of "Holiday." Gracefully Mr.
Cockran turned to Father Vellesian, the
president of the college, and said:
ji "I would bespeak for the young friends
who have' followed so closely the rumina
tions of an elderly man, that ' they be
granted a holiday," and when Father-Vel
lesian granted the request the applause
was deafening and three cheers for the
I New York statesman were given with a
will. ;
Mr. Cockran had no particular subject,
but the trend of his theme was the pur
suit' of r happiness. With Mr. Cockran
were many of the college alumni, includ
ing Judge F. J. Murasky of San; Fra
ncisco, '83; Peter J. McCormack, chief |
deputy Coroner of San Francisco, '88;
Garret McEnerney, 'Si; Charles lleg
gerty, '80; Father William P. Sullivan,
'97; H. J. Stark, C. P. S., '94; Father P.
â¢T. 'Callopy, '94; Father Joseph A.'Me-
Auliffe, '90; W. B. White, '91; Father Mc-
Hugh of East Oakland; Fathers Demp
sey, T. J. O'Connell and Hennessey, of
Alameda; Father Cantwell pf St. Francis,
Alameda; R. P. Troy, president of the
alumni of Sacred Heart College; -Con
gressman W. B. Winn, Peter Hanrahan,
Dr. J. H. Maher, Dr. J. F. Gibbon and
Neil Carey.
Until Mr. Cockran arrived the students
and visitors were entertained by the col
lege orchestra. When the orator entered
the hall he was greeted by cheers, and
was introduced by Father Vellesian, as
a "man among men, one of the chief fac
tors in the public life of America." r .
Mr. Cockran spoke in a conversational
.tone, but occasionally his voice was raised
,ln an appeal to the students' manhood
'and then his listeners got a suggestion
of his oratory. In part, he said:
I feel like addressing you young men as" fel
low students, for I haven't quit studying yet.
You are at one end of life; I am at the other. ,
I began my public life as a teacher in the
Christian brothers' school in New York. The
students were boys, perhaps- younger than you.
They were there preparing for the collegiate
GUI; of their, school life.
,< Kfucatlon Cwes-lts existence to the.muther
chu.*tn. ' For . many years, In , the olden time,
the only man who "commanded " the" public ex
teem "was the man who carried the sword, the
man who could, fight, the man who could de
stroy. The church, during all those dark ages,
upheld education and Insisted' upon education,
despite the fact that it was fought by all tne
nations of Christendom.* And yet they say
that the church^ has < been hostile :to educa
tional institutions, when it has been the foun
tain head of education. It Is for the laity to
dlgpel that prejudice. â¢ It for you young men
who axe preparing fort life. â¢ The last time i
had an Interview 'wl^h Pope Leo XIII waÂ»
about six weeks before his death, and he tcld
n,e that hlÂ» supreme ambition was to see the
work of evangelization progress.
I want to say to you that the short road to
material success Is the strict observance of
the moral law. Is the possession of power suf
ficient for temporal happiness? j You must vso
power to preserve it. Whether it be tha i>o
lltlcal leader in Amvrica. or the Czar of Rus
sia, he is lifted to power to serve the persons
who elevated him. The seat of power is never
the seat of comfort.
Is fame the goal of the seeker after happi
ness? Fame is often mistaken for notoriety.
Fame comes to man at least a generation *tter
he has gone, and that don't amount to much
at' the present time. -
How about wealth? I think that the one man
who has no chance for happiness Is the mil
lionaire. The man you meet cordially on the
street you give a distant nod when you
meet him in the safe-deposit vault. The man
who keeps the door in the safe-deposit \'ault
would know what to do If he heard the ex
plosion of a bomb or a pistol bullet. HÂ« would
ring Irt the police alarm. But he would be be
wildered if he heard a man in the vault whis
tle a cheerful air or hum a comic tune.
Wealth is not to be spurned, for it widens
the theater of your usefulness, but it la not
all. Value wealth acquired by honest effort,
but my Idea of happiness is to absorb all your
faculties in the task before you. - '
The path to happiness is the path, of labor.
Honesty and integrity will sooner or later find
their Just rewards.

With the v disclosures made by the
mothers and fathers of San Francisco re
garding the poisoning of their children
by drugged milk, with the courts forc
ing prosecutions of dairymen accused
of using disease-breeding -compounds,
with tie stimulating effect of a wide pub
licity that has been given the battle of
parents to save their babies' lives, the
municipal Board of Health has become
suddenly alarmed over the situation.
The officials charged with the protec
tion of lives from unsanitary conditions
have hastened to the front that the rec
ords may show that there is a desire on
their part to do their duty by the pub
lic
Following the exposures made by Eu
gene Lent, the attorney, whose children
became^ violently ill from drinking milk
from the New York Dairy, the Health
Department has organized a campaign
all along the line against offending dairy
men. One of the remarkable disclosures
in Lent's fight Is the fact that the pri
vate analysis made of the milk supplied
his household developed unmistakable ev
idences of formaldehyde in the fluid,
while the official investigations made by
the Board of Health had failed to un
cover the presence of the drug.
When Lent, after receiving the opinion
of his physician, Dr. L. H. Hoffman, that
his children were suffering from poisoned
milk, sent a bottle of the stuff to the
analytical chemists, he did so at his own
expense. He did not call in the Health
Board employes for the work.- Lent want
ed the report of the best chemists he
could find, knowing that it would be ren
dered without fear and without favor.
SPURRED BY CITIZEX.
As soon as the report was filed showing
that Dr. Hoffman was correct, the cru
sading parent caused the arrest of George
C. Smart, the dairy proprietor, who had
sold the milk. Smart's case is before
Police Judge Cabaniss to be decided this
week.
Under this stimulus, the Health officials
took a fresh hold yesterday and ordered
the arrest of dairymen on the report of
the city chemist that various conditions
Inhibited by the dairy inspection ordi
nance had been found in the milk samples
taken from the dairies.
In view of the cases, the report shows
that coal tar dyes were used in the milk.
In the others the percentage of - butter
fat disclosed by the analyses was below
the standard set by the department. Six
complaints against the dairymen were
sworn to yesterday in Police Judge Cab
aniss' court and warrants were issued,
the complainants being Health Board in
spectors. The arrests were ordered by
Dr. ' William C. Hassler, chief sanitary
inspector. The dairymen* accused and the
charges follow:
DAIRIES ACCUSED.
Green Valley - Dairy, 703 Vienna street;
J. Linehan, proprietor; coal tar found,
and butter fat 2.6 per cent.
Phoenix Dairy, 1323 Wolsey street; J. T.
Quarles, proprietor; butter fat 2.8 â¢ pef
cent. â¢
Mount Hamilton Dairy, 901 Silver ave
nue; F. Marty, proprietor; butter fat 3
per cent.
Millbrae California Milk Company,
Twenty-nrst and Folsom streets; Shafer
& Green, proprietors; coal tar dye found.
Bay View Ranch, Bay View; J. Sarthou,
proprietor; butter fat 2.9 per cent.
Denver Dairy. Sixteenth avenue South;
butter fat 3 per cent.
Besides these Cassles Bros., 400 Cam
bridge street, were ordered arrested â¢ on
account of their butter fat being 3 per
cent Instead of 3.4 per cent, the standard^
fixed by the board. Against Linehan*
there are two charges, one of using coal
tar dyes, the other, of selling milk with
too low. a percentage of butter fat In it.-
These orders of arrest were based on
the report of H. D. Gibbs, the city chem
ist, who made. the analyses and the bac
teriological examination, of the milk
samples taken from the dairies. ' In
spectors M. J. Brady, William Lendrum,
J. F. Derham, Thomas Lydon and John
Brown with Dr. Hassler took the samples.
In the same report complaint was made
that skimmed milk had been found in a
wagon of Benedict Bros.' dairy, 524 Cas
tro street.
After the warrants had been Issued
Health Officer Ragan directed the witn
drawal of the complaints against Marty,
Sarthou, Zwlssig and Cassles Broe. on the
ground that their previous records tfaa
been good and the tests showed their
milk to be only a trifle belaw. the stand-^
ard. Dr. Ragan said the department was
operating this season v of the year on a
3.2 per cent basis.
The Health Olflcer further - 6ald that
the lowering of the standard now was
due to the fact that on dry feed the per
centage of butter fat Is lower than on
grass feed.
Many milk samcles from other dairies
tested out pus,, detritus and bacilli. But
no action was taken against them, as the
conditions, while showing dirty milk, were
not considered serious enough to warrant
more than a reprimand. . .
Or. Hassler has decided to enforce new
regulations to compel more cleanliness in
the delivery of. millo He believes that
much of the filth found in the fluid un
der bacteriological "examination-i s trace
able to' the exposed conditions of the
measures and cans In the wagons. Spe
cial receptacles for these utensils will be
required and the collection of bacteria
checked so" far as possible.
COALTARDYE HARMFUL.
Dr. Hassler said yesterday:
The coal tar dyes that are found in the milk
are used, to impart a rich, creamy appearance,
such aÂ» the milk ' from " one of the grass fed
cowb In the country would show. Milk > often
takes on a thin, bluish hue that is commer
cially a detriment. That tinge is especially
evident. in milk at this time of the year, when
the cows are ijlven - dry rodder, hay. and the
like This coal tar. dye is handled in the, form
of *'la*tone," ? a commercial - preparation oÂ£ an
aniline orange dye in, the coal tar series.
ThJs coal tar dye impairs digestion and is
rated as deleterious by medical men. It would
be dangerous for a baby sof low vitality, to
take it in " milk, :as ~ the impairment of dl
cestion would cause an organic .weakening that
could produce : death: - The question ' of butter
fat 1b one thaf gives the department much
trouble. While a standard has been set, there
are cases where a lowering of the standard oc
curs even In ; dairies that "are of the highest
trade Of course, when tne fat falls off too

terical During the Alarm
and for Some Time After
OAKLAND, Oct. 23.â There was a min
iature panic aboard the ferry steamer
Bay City this afternoon when gas that
had gathered in the smokestack was Ig
nited. Nearly all the fifty passengers^
rushed for life preservers and even Cap
tain McLean was so badly alarmed .that
he gave orders for two danger signals,
which caused considerable commotion
among the craft on the bay.
It was on the Bay City's 5 o'clock trip
from Ban Francisco, the last trip of the
day, that the trouble occurred. ' The Bay
City had cleared the slip on the other
side and got out into the stream, with her
nose headed for Goat Island, when the
gas. in the smokestack blazed up. Chief
Engineer Zeelander was notified and im
mediately reversed the engine, while Cap
tain McLean gave orders for a signal of
distress. It was feared the boat was
doomed as - the smokestack' was giving
forth large volumes of flame.
But the flames were soon extinguished.
A few minutes later they broke out again
and once more the danger signal was
sounded, but owing to the prompt work
of the crew the second blaze was as
harmless as the first. The boat then
proceeded to its slip at the foot of Broad
way under half steam.
During the trip over more than half
the passengers wore life preservers and
the - greatest excitement prevailed. Sev
eral women passengers were panic strick
en and hysterical | when the boat reached
Oakland. Besides the fifty passengers
there were twenty-two express teams on
the boat.
The Bay City Is on the creek ' route of
the Southern Pacific and is the only ferry
boat that now burns coal. Her boilers
and furnaces are sail I to be in a bad con
dition and recently were | condemned by
the Government inspectors. An exten
sion of time, howeve *, was granted to re
pair her.
TEAMSTERS BAY
QUIT IN GOTHAM
Special Dispatch to ThÂ« Call.
NEW YORK, Oct. 23.â 0n the. issue of
an open shop a general strike of team
sters in New York, Involving an army of
fifty thousand men, will occur within a
few hours, unless one side or the other
yields on this vital point. Each side de
livered an ultimatum in the; struggle f to
day. At a meeting of 200 boss truckmen
it was determined to make i a fight for
the open shop regardless of consequences.
The members of Local No. 70S of the In
ternational Brotherhood of Teamsters
have already agreed to order a strike on
every one of the 225 employers who; re
fuses to sign an agreement that none
but union drivers shall be employed or
those who signify their willingness to
join the union.
At a meeting of the. Grand Executive
Council of the International Brotherhood
to* be held to-morrow evening, it is ex
pected the action of Local No. 708 will be
ratified and the support of the - entire
brotherhood pledged in the (impending
struggle. In ' the Grand Executive Coun
cil are/ represented twenty- two "locals,
which â¢ means fifty thousand; men, includ
ing milk wagon drivers, . express drivers,
cabmen and mail wagon drivers, as well,
as the drivers of delivery wagons ; and
truckmen .in all branches I of ' the trade.
With \u25a0 thlÃ backing there ; is little reason
to doubt that . the executive committee of
Local No. ,708. 'will feel strong enough to
order out 'the men employed,, by, the. boss
truckmen who refuse to . sign ; the new
agreement prescribing that none but
union men shall be employed as drivers.
Already forty strike breakers have been
put to work for Thomas Orr, whose em
ployes have been on strike for several
days. Convoyed by mounted \ policemen
and with ' armed Plnkerton guards riding
beside the drivers, eight of Orr"s nineteen
trucks were" kept 'moving* to-day. .

COURT RULING
OPENS A WAY
Support to the theory, that lawyers who
are not overrun with business ; are going
to try for the guardianships of the .es
tates and persons of certain asylum pa
tients is given by a statement from L.
C. Wlttenmeyer, son of the former guard
ian of aged Walter. K. Dell, just released
from .; the ' Stockton Asylum on,' habeas
corpus proceedings by C. W, ; Eastin, . at
torney, who also wishes to control his
estate. It seems that under a decision
of the Supreme Court many patients now
in;. the. State hospitals could be , released
on habeas corpus proceedings, and that
they, are only : in' these "institutions 'be
cause no. one wishes to have them lib
erated. ' . \u25a0 , ' â¢
' â¢ Mr. Wittenmeyer said In an interview
yesterday: "
vln the case \u25a0 of. Lambert .the . Supreme Court
decided \u25a0 that . the former law . by : which insane
were . committed wan unconstitutional, : and so
any.'; one who , was declared ; insane and \u25a0.. com
mitted -\u25a0 to -an asylum -. between; the years 1597
and v 1803 is held illegally and â¢ can be released
by a" writ of, habeas corpus. "Consequently any
one; who was appointed guardian of the estate
of an insane person during , that time :is \u25a0 not
legally in . charge. . .Thus : when an j insane per
son -Is released through a writ : he can appoint
a new ' guardian, - if he is able, or a new .. onÂ«
may be appointed ' for ' him. -. He stands before,
the .law just as he, did before his Brit ' commit
ment.'" ; â¢ . â¢ * "' â¢â¢.". . '\u25a0':.';â¢ : \u25a0>-. \u25a0'\u25a0
\u25a0 The Dell case is peculiar. Mr. . Dell \u25a0 was ad-
Judged â¢ incompetent In 1882 and the guardian
of; himself and his property was appointed at
that. time. 'That makes his guardianship legal,
although hla ' final commitment in 1898 was Il
legal. \u25a0 Mr,> Eos tin went Â« up rto the " Stockton
Asylum ,of . his own : accord â¢ and : got < Dell- out.'
He . had a power of attorney already made out
and â¢ he had : Dell : sign this, ' along with other
papers.' But I appeared \u25a0 for ' Mrs. Dell, now
the - guardian,' and . showed i that* the guardian
was â¢ first appointed, not under the unconstitu
tional act. but In 1802. Now Eastin is attack
ing the validity of certain of Mra. Dell's afn\
davits: v \u25a0. : '- \u25a0 - - : - \u25a0 . : \u25a0"." ' "V r ' --\u0084 --â¢ \u25a0 \u25a0 .â¢\u25a0 -' \u25a0' \u25a0 ."â¢;

TUESDAY . . . . ..OCTOBER 24, 1905
MR. RUEF ON MURDER.
IN his Alhambra speech Mr. Ruef devoted much time to denun
ciation of the newspapers. He ran the gamut over and back in
attacking them because they oppose his re-election as actual
Mayor of San Francisco. We by no means underwrite everything
that has been said by the press in this campaign,. or in the proces
sion of events that have led up to it. It is a law of human %ffairs
that where transgression is there will be overwrought descriptions
of its conditions. This is unavoidable. But because some may go
to extremes shall others hold back their hands and refuse to smite
the transgressor? We think not.
The Call has dealt with what it believes to be a system of mis
government, inimical to law and order. We have believed, and do
believe* that the known facts justify the belief that the city ad
ministration is weak and venal. Believing this, we haVe to say so,
regardless of the wrath the saying will arouse. It "is not to our
interest to blacken the fame of San Francisco. Nor is it to our in
terest to permit this tp be done by the sworn guardians of the- city's
good name. A newspaper owes to its readers fairness and fearless
ness in dealing with public men and matters, and we have tried to
be fair and fearless.
Whether we have succeeded or not, Mr. Ruef is not the judge.
The prisoner at the bar is not equipped to pass impartial judgment
on the jury. In his four hours' speech Mr. Ruef wore out the cork
screw of rhetoric in uncorking the vials of his wrath, and, as is al
ways the case with an angry man, gave to his hearers a' great deal
of bad advice. anB among, it this : "Let me tell you, there are
only two ways of getting at a newspaper. One is to sue them for
libel and the other is to kill them." This is a bad sentence, quoted
just as it appears in Mr. Ruefs organ. What the excited oratpr
meant was, that there are two ways of getting at a newspaper man,
one being a libel suit and the other murder.
He made this plain iruhis next sentence, as follows: "The kill
ing is very unsatisfactory because it merely removes one scoundrel,
one blackguard, one blackmailer from the earth, but it brings to
your family and those who are depending on you a great deal of
misery and suffering until a jury can dismiss the case against you,
because nobody is going to convict anybody in this community for
killing a newspaper man. I wish you would all leave your names
here, because if I ever get foolish enough to do a thing of that kind
I want you all on the jury."
These interesting remarks were received with howls of ap
plause by his followers, and the reporters present felt rather un
comfortable. The discharge of their duty by newspapers does not
always make them popular. Xor is their command of publicity/al
ways wisely used. But suppression of criticism by murder or the
threat to murder is far less tolerable than misuse of publicity. The
press has always been denounced by the corrupt for its exposure of
corruption. The terms employed by Mr. Ruef axe not .original with
him. They are borrowed out of the vocabulary of public scoundrel
ism arid miscreancy, that has been used whenever and wherever
graft, corruption and indecency have been exposed by a newspaper.
Mr. Ruefs denunciation was uttered here long ago, and his
method of preventing criticism by the press was long ago advised
and tried. He is historically inaccurate. There has been hanging
for murdering a newspaper man in San Francisco. Â»It was in a time
that much resembles these days. There was official partnership'
with vice and crime. Vice earned the profits of immunity and di
vided them with the official representatives of the people. Decent
people went softly and stayed in nights. The conditions resembled
those described by the Grand Jury in its last report. A newspaper
man in those days offended the powers by denouncing the condi
tions they permitted and from which they profited. For this he
was shot" down on the street by one of the political supporters of
the conditions he had denounced. The thief of police stood by,
apparently to protect the assassin.
The murderer was taken to jail, where he held levees and waited,
for that vindication by a jury which Mr. Ruef says is due all assas
sins who murder newspaper men. But the vindication never came,
nor the petit jury. The larger jury, the Vigilance Committee, took
the assassin from jail, tried him and hanged him out over the side
walk from a window on Sacramento stret, down near Front. We
will take pleasure in pointing out the exact spot to Mr. Ruef any
time that he will call. It may help him not to "get foolish and try to
suppress criticism by murder. We desire also to admonish him that
the people make a distinction between newspaper attacks upon pri
vate citizens, which are hardly ever justifiable and usually justly
offensive, and newspaper criticism of public affairs. The one is the
invasion of private rights. The other is the discharge of a public
duty. If Mr. Ruefs threat of murder overawe the press there can
be a riot of corruption unending and unchecked, except by a vigi
lance committee.
THE BANK COMMISSION.
THE State Bank Commission has done well in its timely warn
ing against unsafe and risky financiering on the part of bank
ing institutions. Perhaps we have rather a surplus of loan and
discount banks, and this may account for some of the risks they take
to establish themselves. The special violation of the statute as
well as of the sound policy of banking, to which the commission has
called sharp attention, is the loaning of depositors' money to stock
holders in the bank to pay for their stock, taking their promissory
notes in security.
'This is forbidden by the statute, and by prudence and proper
policy. It is supposed by depositors that the stockholders in a bank
invest their own capital in its shares, and that is a guarantee of
the soundness of the bank. When they take the money of depositors
to pay for the stock a grievous offense is committed. On a small
scale it is a repetition of the methods of frenzied finance followed
by the great insurance 'companies of New York, which are now un
der investigation and doomed to punishment.
That our Bank Commission promptly stamps it for what it is
is evidence that the Commissioners are not doing merely perfunctory
work, but are doing their duty as the guardians of the money of
depositors and the protectors of that right system of credit which
is necessary to the transaction of business. It is expected, and cer
tainly is to be hoped, that the institution that has furnished the ex
ample and the opportunity for admonition will be able to promptly
right itself and continue its business, on- a' proper and legitimate
system without loss either to its depositors or its stockholders.

And first he looked almighty wise, and,

And then he stuck a card outside that
read, "They's smallpox here!"
And there was grief in Dobbins Camp
.and days was mighty drear.
I am not made to sling bokays, but
this here thing I say:- - - -
That mild and gentle gospel sharp, he
loomed up big that day. .
lie went to Simmons' cabin then and
says, "What can I do?"
Fol* he had seen his duty plain and
meant to see It through. --.-
And there he stayed and resked his
life the kid and ma to cure, >
While old Bill Simmons wiped his eyes
and says, "An angel, sure!"
And after they was : up and round- his
. lamp of life grew dim, 1
Till Dobbins Camp forgot to cuss, the
while it prayed for him;
*And them there prayers, they hit the
mark, for Ephr'im Baynes pulled
through.
And all the boys raised hats to him to
show his style they knew.
'Twan't very long before there run a
rumor here and there \u25a0
That Bill had been converted and had
righteousness to spare;
And so we put it straight to him in
somethin' like. this style:
"We hear you've turned from carnal
ways and bask in heaven's
smile?"
"I have," says Bill. "I may be weak,
but this here thing I know: ...^
"I'm goin' to back that parson chap
while I have got a show,
And I can lick the damdashed blank
that says a word agen" â
We didn't mind his fervent words; we
merely said, "Amen!"

But when he left I'm grieved to 'say
that William then backslid.

MIRROR OF DAME FASHION
CHARMING FROCK FOR STREET OR HOUSE WEAR.
A PRETTY shade of 'rose-red henrietta is employed for this dainty
little frock: and- a much 'deeper shade of velvet, accentuates the color
scheme. The blouse fastens in the ' back, J the front displaying an in
serted chemisette and high collar. of lace, the- dark velvet serving to en
frame this all around. Deep pleats on shoulders allow for sufficient
fullness across the chest, and little tucks are grouped. below the chemisette.
The sleeve has the modish double effect,''- the upper part of the henrietta,
this assuming a loose puff form, and the lower part of the lace_to match the
chemisette, a flaring cuff of velvet dividing the two. A sash of 'velvet ribbon
to match is tied around the \u25a0 waist, quite an elaborate series of loops and
ends apearing in the back, and coming but half way to the hem of the
skirt. The skirt, has a box-pleated tabller front, thepleats stitched down
almost to the knee, and then well pressed from there. The sides are
circular, darted over the hips, and the back follows the front gore in
arrangement. Two rows of velvet ribbon, each of varying- width, appear
on the hem. :

Miss Treanor' s engagement to Clarence
M. Oddle of New York was made.
This news cast in the shade all other
pleasant attendant features, the young
hostess quickly becoming the center of
attention.

at Tonopah, has become a citizen of the
West and will remain in this locajity per

Mrs. Jordan and Miss Treanor were
assisted by a dozen young people in re

j Mfss Treanor is very favored with
friends and the only regret attached to
the pleasant news is that her new home

THE ART OF WAITING.
Wallace Rice
From the foreign dispatches comes a
pitiful story of Miss Edith Allonby, done
to death by her own hand because she
could not secure the immediate publica
tion of a serious book she had written.
Into it had gone the best effort of which
she was capable, and she believed it had
a message of the first importance to
mankind. The refusal to publish it as
she had written it led to her taking her
own life.
It Is hard for youth to waitâ and Miss
Allonby was a young woman. She had
health, beauty, independent means and
undeniable talent. All of these are
eagerly desired by every, sane human be
ing, and in themselves they constitute
nearly* all that the world holds of good.
Lacking patience, all of them" counted for
nothing. ,
Yet few men and women obtain any of
their heart's desires . much before they
reach the age of 40. As ; the world grows
older and competition demands that more
and more preparation.be given for fight
ing- Its battles, this age Increases rather
than diminishes. But to have come to
40 years is to-day almost a requisite.
Two-score of the allotted three-score-and
ten years must have passed before the
modern man or woman finds his olace In
life. "

take tl^ advice or follow the example of
age and experience, there would be many
fewer heartburnings. It Is not even
necessary to listen to advice; any exer
cise of the Dowers of observation will
convince the most incredulous that such
is the fact. Forty is the determining
age of a man's success.
Before one's Drlme is reached there
must be extended preparation. A busi
ness or profession has to be learned and
not only learned but experimented with
until the best application in practice can
be made of the theoretical knowledge that
accompanies it.
A home has to be made. Wives and
husbands have to live together long
enough for the. mighty problem of two
personalities in Intimate \u25a0 contact witn
conflict to find solution. Children have
to be studied and their wants provided

There is success a-plenty both before

nearly true.

JURORS REFUSE
TO INDICT CIRL
Judge Cook Appears Before
Inquisitorial Body in the
Case of Henriette Eeush
What practically amounted to a battle
between Superl^ Judge Cook and Dis
trict Attorney Byington was thrashed out
before the Grand Jury yesterday and the
District Attorney won the victory. The
matter considered was the charge of per
jury made against Henriette Reush, the
fifteen-year-old girl who accused Bennet
Millar, a tailor at 321^ Ellis street, of
criminal assault and then denied her
statement on the witness stand at the
second trial of the defendant. The Grand
Jury refused to indict the girl.
At the first trial one juror hung out
firmly for acquittal. When the second
trial was called the District Attorney's
office was surprised to learn that the girl
had gone back on her story. When ques
tioned by the District Attorney she said
her mother had appeared to her in a
dream and told her to tell .the whole
truth. She did not follow these instruc
tions so closely as to say who really
was guilty of the offense against her."
The furthest she would go upon being
pressed was to say that a boy named
Leopold was. guilty. The girl had already
been questioned by. Judge Cook in his ;
chambers.
A. continuance was asked by Deputy
District Attorney Ashe, but Judge
Cook, who had already sworn twelve
tentative jurors, ordered that the
case proceed. The girl j swore that
her' first' story was wrong. and
that the. mysterious boy named Leo
pold was the guilty person. Subsequently
she denied this arid said Millar was really
guilty, but that he had begged her for
the sake of his wife and family to swear
he- was not. She said .he had told hei
to say the son of Brilliant, the furniture
man, was the guilty person and : that
Brilliant would give her $5000 to keep still
about it.
; Jennie Johnson, who arranged the con
versation between the 1 girl and the de
fendant, is awaiting . her jj preliminary
examination on a charce of subornation
of perjury.
\u25a0: At .the close of the second trial, which
resulted in an acquittal under , Judge -
Cook's Instructions, after the jury had
deliberated some time, the court, ordered
the girl into the custody of the Sheriff
that her case might be laid before the
Grand Jury. District Attorney Byington"
said he would not take the matter .be-;
fore the Grand Jury owing to the . youth
of the girl, and the court instructed .At
torney Black- of the defense to do so. : ;
Judge Cook; was present in person :be- !
fore 'the Grand. Jury. ;: After Jt had | re
fused Ito indict the â¢. girl Deputy * District
Attorney Ashe brought up, the matter
of ' the ; alleged ; attempt of Millar to , In-,,
duce, her- to swear falsely. Judge Cook
said that Millar could not be indicted, as
it took" two \ witnesses In such a case.
No indictment was, found.

gage Law and - Order Men
\, Brigadier General Henry T. Allen,
chief of the Philippine . constabulary,
was d passenger on the Siberia, which
arrived yesterday. He- has been in the
islands for,, six years : and is now re
turning: home on a*- five months' leave.
â¢ He was the organizer and founder
of the constabulary in the Philippines.
He says that .the constabulary now
consists of 6500 men, scattered
at different points of the islands. He
is very anxious to get between thirty
and thirty-flve; bright college, bred
young men to enter that service as of
ficers. -He says that 'it is a good field
,for young men who are well educated,
and haye talent, nerve and energy,
coupled with Intelligence. At present
there are a few officers in the con
stabulary, who are" West Pointers, but
the: majority have either been pro
moted from non-commissioned "of fleers
or from enlisted men in the regular
army.
, Officers . in ; the constabulary ar*e - paid
as follows: Third lieutenants. $1100
gold per annum, with quarters fur
nished and $50 extra a year for learn
ing a dialect; second lieutenants. $1200
per annum; first lieutenants, $1300 per
annum, and captains, from $1600 to
$2000 per annum."
4 The general says the natives are im
proving as workmen. The electric line
recently finished was constructed by
native workmen, who did the labor 40
per cent less than was tTie estimate of
the construction.
General Allen says that while his
.visit to this country is not for the pur
pose of getting men to Join the con
stabulary he hopes he will succeed in
obtaining a number before his return
to the islands. He said:
"The islands/are in the best condi
tion that has existed since the United
States took possession. The people
are very peaceful, t and are favorably
inclined toward this country. There is
some scrapping going onÂ» occasionally
in .the mountains, but that Is to be ex
pected."

BIG FELLOWS

Both Jack O'Brien and Al
Kaufmann Look Fit for
Bout on Friday Evening
EVEN MONEY THE PRICE
Experience of Philadelphia
Boxer, However, Will Sure
ly Make Him 10 to 8 Choice
Al Kxs-ufmann and Jack O'Brien have
about completed the hardest part of their
\u25a0* ork for Friday night's contest at Wood
ward's Pavilion, and from now on they
\u25a0Rill have little more to do to keep on
edge. Both big fellows have been work-
Ins like Trojans for nearly three weeks
and their condition could hardly be Im
proved on. Kaufmann will go into the
ring weighing a trifle over 190 pounds,
and while O'Brien's weight is still un-.
certain, he will probably tip the beam
at about ITO pounds. 2*wÂ»'*"'i~ i '
Probably Al's advantage in weight is
the reason for his being an even-money
chance in the betting, which opened yes
terday. One hundred dollars was lelt
with Zeke Abrams yesterday to be
wagered on the California heavyweight
at that price. Betting on the contest
promises to be lively before fight night.
Al's knockout record seems to over
ehadow the experience of his opponent,
\u25a0*ho looks to be the legitimate tavorlte.
Plenty of O'Brien money, however, will
most "likely send the Eastern boxer to
the post a ten to eight favorite.
The bout is being widely discussed In
the downtown sporting resorts and has
awakened considerable interest among
the fight fans- A heavyweight contest
Tvlfl fill a long-felt want for the patrons
of the game, for first-class big fellows
have not fought In the local ring since
the Johnson-Hart affair, which was also
handled by the San Francisco Athletic
Club. , 1
The preliminary lads are In training
and can be depended upon to do their
share toward making the evening's en
tertainment lively.- -
The sale of seats will open to-morrow
morning at Greggain's. 112 Ellis street.

declaration that he -would not vote to

itole to supply his family with food.
A sensation followed the announce
ment. '\u25a0- .
\u2666 "I am not the sort of man you want
for the Jury," said Neumelster. "I have
helped unfortunate men out of Jail."
"Your Honor," he continued, "there
are cases where I would not vote to In
dict a man. I would not so vote if the
man's family were in want and he bad
stolen to feed Ms children and wife.
I couldn't do it, that's all."
"But you realize," put 'in the Judge,
"that the law does not constitute you
a legislator when a juror. It Is your
duty to enforce the law as you find it."
"Well. It would bother me like the
very much to do it. I could not
vote to indict a man under such cir
cumstances. I couldn't conscientiously
vote that way. I couldn't convince my
self of its being a crime."
"We would be rapidly drifting
toward anarchy if many Jurors thought
as you do," was Judge Barnes' reply.
"You are not the kind of man we .want
on the Jury. You are disqualified and
discharged."

RAILROADS TRY
A NEW SCHEME
Special Dispatcfh to The Call.
SIOUX CITY, la,, Oct. 23.â 1n their cam
paign of "education," the railroads have
organized a "ready print" syndicate for
the purpose of furnishing gratuitously
"patent insldes" to weekly newspapers
throughout the country-
Indisputable evidence of this fact was
brought to the attention of a local con
cern this week when it found it was
coming in competition with the railroads
In Its "ready print" service. The local
concern supplies upward of 400 weeklies
In lowa, Minnesota, Dakota and Ne
braska with "patent lnsides." Its pat
rons violated their pledges of secrecy to
the railroads ( In several Instances and
told of the "snap" that was offered
them. A few of them accepted it. In-
QUiry elicited the information that the
same practice is employed by the rail
roads In other States, in an effort to pre
vent public sentiment from coming out
too strongly for the railroads.
Copies of these "patents" have reached
this city. Analysis of them shows that at
first they were harmless enough, those
articles that were destined to stimulate
sentiment in behalf of the railroads be
ing carefully disguised. Subsequent is
sues, however, show that the "educa
tional" matter was more and more plain
and constantly becoming less thinly
veiled in each Issue until now they are
comparatively frank in their advocacy
of railroad interests.
The contents of these prints- is ingen
iously prepared, consisting of matter of
special interest to farmers. Here and
there, however, are numerous items, de
scribing the development of railroads, de
picting how the development of the na
tion has been dependent upon the rail
roads; also giving figures showing the
vast sums invested in railroads, the en
ormous sums expended annually to their
army of employes, the small dividends
paid to stockholders and other data calcu
lated to show they are not unduly profit
able.
FIREMEN -IN CHICAGO
TO WORK IN SHIFTS
CHICAGO, Oct. 23.â A test of the
two-platoon system for the fire depart
ment was begun yesterday, and will
continue for three months. The station
at 83 Franklin s^eet. one of the most
Important in the city, was designated
by Mayor Dunne as the scene of the
test) and to provide for two full shifts
enough men will be transferred from out
side houses to Increase the working
force from twenty-six to thlrty-slx men.
Under the system on trial half of
the men will work on the night shift of
fourteen hours, while the day shift has
ten hours of duty. Each Sunday at noon
the shifts exchange places, so that the
night shift, when it begins duty for the
week; must stand a watch of twenty
hours. &â¢*?.]
Under the old sj'Stem every man was
entitled to an hour for each meal at his
home, and in the course of twelve days
his time off consisted of one full day of
twenty-four hours, one night of twelve
hours and four half-days.
While the two-platoon system gives an
aggregate of double this amount of time
off duty, it ia argued that the time off
is of little benefit for recreation, as most
of it wilt be taken up in sleep. During
the long, unbroken watches under the
new system the men are not allowed to
leave the station - ; even to the extent
of crossing the street to secure tobacco.
CUBA CONSULTS AMERICA
ON PROPOSED TREATY
United States Advises Ag-alnst the Pact
Urged on Island by Great
Britain.
WASHINGTON. Oct. 23.â 1t can be
reiterated on ' the highest authority
that, although convinced; that the pro
posed Anglo-Cuban treaty Is distinctly
injurious to Cuba's Interests, the
Washington Government has never In
directly or directly questioned Cuba's
full right to negotiate such a treaty
with Great Britain or with 'any other
foreign nation. When asked by Cuba
for an expression of opinion regarding
the proposed - treaty with Great Brit
ain, the Washington Government out
lined the disadvantages which would
accrue to the republic under such an
arrangement. It was pointed out that
It would preclude this country from
giving to Cuba any further commercial
concessions. . /

JAPAN'S GREAT
NAVAL REVIEW
TOKIO. Oct. 23.â The naval review to
day passed off without* the slightest hitch.
It was an impressive sight, not on ac
count of the size and number of the ships,
but as a conglomeration of fighting craft
fresh from the war and crowned with
victories "of unprecedented magnitude.
Three hundred and eight warships, in
cluding the foreign Russian battleships
Peresviet (renamed by the Japanese the
Sagami, Poltava (Tango), Nlcolal I (Ikl),
the Ironclads General Admiral Apraxlne
(Oklnoshima) and Admiral Seniavian
(Minoshlma), twelve auxiliary cruisers,
including three chartered vessels; twenty
eight torpedo-boat destroyers, including
the captured Bedovi and Ryeshltelni;
seventy-BeventorpedO7boats and five sub
marine boats, were, drawn up In six lines.
: The Emperor, on board the cruiser
Asama, led by the protected cruiser
Yaeyama and escorted by the - gunboats
Tatsuta, Chihaya and Manshu, passed
along the front of the first line, which
was headed by the battleship Shlkishima,
Admiral Togo's flagship. When the Nico
lai I, which was at the end of the line,
was reached, the cruiser Asama headed
due- northward and then In a westerly
direction, entering between the eecona
and third lines and afterward resumed
her original position. During this ma
neuver Admiral Togo was at the Em
peror's side.
The Emperor then received in audience
on board the Asama Admiral Noel and
the captains of. the British and American
warships present (the battleship, Wisco
nsin and the cruiser Cincinnati).
- The weather was fair, but It was misty
on the water. Popular enthusiasm was
aroused to the highest pitch. Besides the
thousands who witnessed the naval
pageant .from all sorts of craft In the
bay all of the available points of vantage
along the shore were densely covered
with eager spectators. The spectacle
caused much Joy and satisfaction among
the Japanese, especially in the breasts of
those who recalled that only forty years
have elapsed since at that very spot no
â¢ warships except those of foreign powers
had ever: floated. It Is 'believed that the
review will give a powerful stimulus to
national education. .
. TOKIO, Oct.' 24, noon.â Toklo's reception
to-day to' officers and men of the com
bined fleets \ was a most notable affair.
The day was extremely, fine and the pub
lic enthusiasm was unparalleled. * :.';;.
j As the procession moved from the Shim
! bashl .railway, station . to Uyeno Park,
"along \u25a0 the crowded streets, the air was
rent with .thunderous cheers.
i Admiral Togo's carriage was profusely
decorated with : flowers and ' the public
feeling toward, him was next to that
shown to - the' Emperor .'

ANGELS LOOK
LIKE WINNERS
Southern Team Comes With
a I\ush and Figures to Get
Away With the Pennant
COMMUTERS ARE ALL IN
San Francisco and Portland
Show Flashes of Speed,
but Never Go the Route
GAMES TO-DAY.
Portland at 1 San 'Francisco*
Tacoma at Oakland.
Seattle at Los Angtln.
From the present outlook in the base
ball pennant race" the Ang&s seem to
have, one royal chance to get away with
the flag for the second half of the. sea
son. The southern brigade of balltossers
is now in the running for keeps, while
Oakland has slumped so badly that they
do not loom , up dangerous any more.
*Los Angeles has been playing some
grand ball, and. by beating the Tigers so
decisively during the , last two . weeks,
they climbed to the top of the heap. In
the meantime,- the, other teams of'tfie
league were breaking about even, save
TacOma, which suffered such a humilia
tion at the hands of Slorley's stars.
It seems strange that a team like Ta
coma, which won the first half of the
season so decisively, should fall down
and figure with the tallenders in the
second half. If race-track stewards had
charge of the league they would undoubt
edly take a fall out of. Mike Fisher and
demand an explanation as to the reversal
of form displayed by his team.
San Francisco and Portland look \u25a0to fig
ure about even. Both teams are in-and
outers. One week they play big league
ball and made a bid for first honors; then
they, turn right around and slump so bad
ly that the fans all become disgusted.
They will hook up this afternoon in
the first game of the series, and the out
come is about a toss-up, though the Seals
should have a shade the better of it on
the home grounds.
Oakland needs pitchers. With Schmidt
gone, the team Is In a bad way for box
artists. Graham was rated as the stand
by, but he is so erratic that he never
can be depended on to win any games.
Blexrud shows flashes of speed at times,
but he has not won games enough In this
league to stamp him as a head-liner.'
Ham Iberg Is really the only reliable
man Oakland has now, but he alone can
not keep the team at the top of the list.
Beginning to-day there will be baseball
every day at Oakland, with the exception
of Monday. The Tigers will meet the
Commuters this afternoon In a week's
series. If Tacoma does not begin to win
a few games soon, there seems to be no
hope left, but In Oakland the Tigers en
counter easy game, and should do some
good.
LOWER PRICE
IS DEMANDED
FRESNO, Oct. 23.â The directors of the
Central California Raisin . Growers' Com
pany were In session until late this even-
Ing, discussing a proposition put to, them
by the packers. The packers and some of
the officials of the company demand that
the price "of raisins be lowered In order
to get off, some of the goods that have
accumulated. It Is believed by some of
the men that unless the price is lowered
there will be a big holdover, which will
mean possible disaster In prices next
year. The sessions of the directors were
secret, but it was given out that there
was a deadlock and no action was taken.
An adjournment was taken until to-mor
row morning, when the matter will again
be taken up In discussion.
At a secret meeting of the California
Raisin-Growers' t Company to-night a
cut of 1 cent a pound on all seeded
raisins was ordered.

BETTING ON NEW
YORK ELECTION
Special Dispatch to ThÂ« Can.
NEW YORK. Oct. 23.â There were somÂ»
interesting changes in the election bet
ting odds to-day", the most Important of
which was an improvement, in a specu
lative way, in the chances of success of
District Attorney Jerome. From belns
a "long shot" last week Jerome was
picked as an even choice with Oa
borne, the Tammany nominee, who has
been favorite heretofore. One sum of
$5000 was bet at evens to-day on Jerome.
Last .week the latter's chances of elec
tion were represented by odds of two
to five. .
Whether sentiment has changed con
cerning McClellan's prospects did not ap
pear, but bettors found it impossible to
get odds of five to one, as was the case
last week. There was one bet of $1000
to $200 that McClellan would be elected,
but this wager was placed early in the
day. Later the odds shortened and at
the close the Tammany nominee was four
to one. J. J. Judge placed a bet with
Steele and De Kay of $300 to $1000 on
the field against McClellan.
There was a decided improvement ia
the betting on Hearst's chances. Even
money was wagered in liberal quantities
that he would poll 100,000 votes. Less was
heard of Ivlns* chances, and there were
bets that McClellan would poll as many
votes as Ivins and Hearst together.
That interest was centering In the run
of Hearst was evidenced by the number
and variety of offers as to the votes he
would poll. Even money was offered
thafhe would not get 110.000 votes, even
money that he would get 100.000. and 73
to 100 that he would not get 100,000 rotes.
RAISIN DEALER
OCCUPIES CELL
FRESNO. Oct. 23.â W. C. West, man
ager of the California Canners' Associa
tion, was arrested to-day and charged
with grand larceny. He Is accused by
Thomas H. Lynch, manager of the Cen
tral California Raisin Growers' Company,
with the theft of 600.000 raisin cartons.
Early in the season West secured -ths
Seroplan Brothers' packing-house, which
was not taken into the packers' and grow
ers' combine, and set out to ship raisms
East without regard to the prices set by
the growers and the packers. ln the com
bine. In order to cripple West's company
Lynch bought up 1.000.000 raisin cartons,
which were to be used, for seeded raisins,
entirely cutting off 'the California Can
ners' Association's supply. West went to
a storage house \u25a0 here where the cartons
were kept and produced a release of a
mortgage held \u25a0by a local bank. This
mortgage covered only three cases of car
tons, but West managed to get 800.000 of
the cartons stored on the strength of ths
release of the three cases of cartons.*,*
To-day Lynch discovered that the car
tons were gone and that -West had taken
them.' West 'was arrested on a warrant
issued by Police Judge Herbert FYBrlggs.

BEATS KOREA'S TIME FROM YOKOHAMA BY THIRTY-SIX MINUTES
Harjiman Backs His
Ship and Wins
$2000
Divides Robert Goe
let's Money Among
the Crew.
The liner Siberia now holds the world's
record for speedy traveling between
Japan and the mainland. She arrived
yesterday direct from Yokohama, and she
made bettor lime than her twin sister.
the Korea, by Just thirty-six minutes.
Incidentally she won for President K. H.
Harrlman, .who was a passenger, $2000,
which the transportation king turned
over to the men who had persuaded the
liner's engines to do their bÂ«st.
The Cr>oo was contributed by Robert
Goelet, who made the round trip In the
Siberia with President Htrriman. Harri
man Droved his sporting blood by taking
the bet when the Siberia's chance for
breaking the record looked very dark.
There had been two days of strong and
contrary gales. The sun had been hidden
and the stars obscured so that taking an
observation had been out of the ques
xlon. The liner was being navigated by
dead. -reckoning: and the barometer held
no hopes of a change In the weather.
.."Your old shio won't make it, Harrl
man," remarked Goelet. "The Korea will
knock FÂ»ots out of her."
"And how much did I hear you say you
were willing to risk on the worth of your
opinion?" bantered back Harriman.
"I'll bet 52000 to $1000 that she does not
beat the Korea's time."
"I'll Just go you."
And when the arrival time was taken
and it had been figured out to every
body's satisfaction, that the Siberia had
won by a margin of thirty-six minutes,
Goelet handed to Mr. Harriman a check
for $2000. Harriman turned the check
over to Purser Jerome, and when the
Siberia's crew is paid off every member
that contributed extra effort to secure the
nwflfu! burst of speed will receive part
of the Goelet check with the compliments
of President E. H. Harriman.
The Siberia was ten days. t*>n hours and

WANTS A HIGH
SALOON LICENSE
Association Appeals to the
Voters to Support Propo
sition to Increase Tax
PRESENTS SO3IE DATA
Offers Comparisons as Be
tween San Francisco and
Other Cities of Country
The High License Association , has is
sued a statement to the public, signed by
Charles A. Murdock. president, and Leon'
C. Osteyee, in .which an appeal is made
to the voters to support the proposition
of a license of ,$125 a quarter on retail
liquor dealers, which will be submitted at
the municipal election November 7. The
appeal recites: !
The present annual retail liquor HcÂ«nse in
San Francisco is Â§84. Of the fourtesn- oth?r
largest cities in the United States the next
lowest is Milwaukeeâ s2oo. The highest is
Bostonâ s2ooo. The j average is $705. Oui
license therefore. Is leaa than one-eighth of
the am&unt that general experience has shown
to be Just and collectable. - - .
Under this ridiculous license saloons nourish
in a way. unknown elsewhere. On the basiÂ»
of the , census of 10CO for every 10,000 in
habitants we support ninety-two saloons. New
Orleans is the driest, having. only eisht. The
average outside of San Francisco is thirty
one, so that we can boast of almost threÂ»
times the number that elsewhere, on the aver
age, ban been found - necessary or de3irable.
There is an acknowledged relation between
the output \u25a0or the saloons and the intake oi
the police courts. About 00 per cent of thÂ«
cost o* the police department Is attributable
to too- much liquor. Other communities ccÂ«
to.lt that the interest that causes the ex
pense pays a fair proporlon of Us coat. San
Francisco collects from retail liquor license*
21) aer cent of the cost of its police depart
ment. Buffalo (with its $750 license) collect*
170 per cent. The average in the fourteen i
-cities Is .80 per cent. So that San Francisco
gets, back a little more than a third as much,
proportionally, as the great : Eastern cities.
That this remarkable record may not be
attributed to our peculiar- Pacific Coast con
ditions we- have- only to study our sister
cities on the coast. Portland, with a $500
license, collects ICS per cent of the cost of
her police department. The average of thÂ»
five principal coast cities is 145 per cent.
So that San Francisco collects just one-fifth
as much, proportionally, as her neighbors.
Is this a showing to be proud ' of? The
lowest license in the â¢ land (one-eighth â¢ the
average)! The largest number of saloons per
capita (three times the average)! The smallest
proportion of meeting police department es- !
peniwg (one-third of Eastern cities, one-fifth
of Pacific Coast cities)'. Those who are proud
of this ohowlng can manifest It by pushing
the button that gays "Against the ordinance*
at the next election.
The city now Imposing a $500 license which
Is nearest In our class as to population and
expenditure is St. Louis. If the results
reached there should be realized here wÂ«
would, while reducing the number of the poor
est saloons, increase our revenue from tne
license about $:550,p00 a year. This would
either materially reduce the property tax oi
enable the olty to erect fine public butldlngi
and eventually to become the moat beautiful
'city on "the continent.
The association presents data collected
from Eastern and Pacific Coast cities
touc^ilnff 'retail liquor licenses, showing
that in the East the annual license runs
as high as J2OOO in Boston, $1100 each in
Pittsburg and Philadelphia, $950 average
in New York, $300 in Washington, the
lowest of fourteen cities quoted being
Milwaukee, where the tax Is $200.- The
Eastern average of licenses is $704 a year,
the. average number of . saloons .to each
10,000 inhabitants, being thirty-one, and
the average percentage -of -Police Depart
ment expenses paid by liquor license Is
80 per cent. The number of. saloons in
San Francisco is ninety-two to each 10.000
â¢inhabitants, and .the $84 annual â¢ license
pays 29 per centof the Police Department
expenses. The . annual licenses- paid in
five. coast cities outside of San Francisco
are: Oakland $400. Portland $500, Tacoma
$600, Los Angeles $900, Seattle $1000, the
coast average being $680, with an average
ratio of thirty saloons to each 10,000 pop
ulation, with 45 per cent more than the
Police "Department expenses met by
liquor licenses.
The association notes that the proposi
tion can be carried by a vote. of 14,000;
that it will . appear on the upper left
hand corner of the voting machine, and
can be voted after a straight ticket has
been registered.

Clrurch on the institution which he rep
resents. ' . . . \u0084
He said the People's Place is; not a
church, nor a mission, nor home,* nor
school, nor club, . nor social experiment
station, arid was not merely a social
settlement. .
" The People's Place, he said, is a so
cial center where the Importance of the
religious and spiritual \ element in the
development of character Is empha
sized. ' "
The principles upon which the work
is conducted, he explained, are forma
tion and not reformation, the teaching:
of self-reliance and self-support.
He. made it clear that it was not
charity work, and that they sought to
reach the child and the home,. to make
good men and . good: citizens out of
those whose environment tends other
wise. '
Mr. Flak; ; said that the methods
adopted are neighborly association with
the people in their homes and in the
social -center, Kindly offers in sickness
and distress and the provision in the
People's "Place of. attractive means of
self-Improvement.' . ;
He reminded the meeting 1 that free
medical advice Is regularly given and
that medicines are supplied at a nomi
nal price. The officers are Edward
F. Adams, president; Charles R. Bishop,
.vice-president, and James T.Musgrove,
secretary-treasurer. .
Among those-from out of town who
were present were the Rev. F. A. Keast
of Santa Clara and the Rev. John Ste
phens of Stockton. :
Speaking, of the Christian Endeavor
Society before the Congregational Min
insters' meeting yesterday the Rev. H.
A. : Luckenbach , said a critic had re
marked that the organization "had been
going to seed for the. last ten years."
Luckenbach, in reply, said that t all
must remember that only things that
God produces can ; go ' to seed. It is the
natural fruit and flower, not the ar- j
tlflcial rose or the -wax fruit, that go
to seed. -
Christian Endeavor had gone to seed
in their churches, and a harvest, in!
some cases thirty, in . some sixty and
in some a hundred, fold has been gath
ered..^ . - ---. ...
The more than a million church
members who had come into the church
membership during the past ten years,
he declared, bear witness to the fact.
Ten years ago. said Mr. Luckenbach,
the .United Society of Christian Endea
vor was the only national orgunixation.'
Now.. it has multiplied into united ~ so
cieties in "Canada, 'Â«Mexico, the United
Kingdom, Australia, South Africa, In

NEW YORK, Oct. 23â To-Uay's stock mar
ket continued the speculative movement in
kiigurated th-e latter part of last wtek. The
market was bruad, active and strong, though
Â»'- Â»iÂ« under ihe necessity of absorbing the
j^'ge amount ol profit taking to-da> as the
reaJt uf the attractive i>ronio accrued en last
week's advances. The cansjiicuous feature o'
irking was the odJ part played by the in
custrtal stocks of the lower grade in the epec
ualuon. In the list ot gains of one point and
upward on the days' transactions not less
Uian forty slocks and industrials will be found
to figure.
Whilt^ the railroad list was not lacking in
ein-ngth, thiÃ thowing serves to throw ihat
j-irt or the list into the â¢ background. Only a
tifcadlui ot tht raoti proinlnt-nt active &\f ks
moved as much as a point and they were late
coming into ih* aiuvement. St. Paul was the
first vi thÂ»! railroads to show strength which
*yes coupled u-:th professtd expectation or an
Â»*ny snnountvmtnt of the Â«uy^osed project of
Â«tn Â«-x.tension of tht- line to the Pacific-. The
raiiruaii equiiimtnt btocke naturally held the
loremciit place in the movement in the indus
trials. Tfcti extraordinary demand for all Ttmds
Â«-'i ..\u25a0.;:.\u25a0:.: for railroads explains in a large
aejjrce the Â«tÂ£mand :or thtse securities. ThÂ«n
the txiraordinary success of the campaign m
American Locomotixe in breaking the deadlock ;
in thÂ»> speculation last week and giving the
tÂ«rfwii<nll their first taste of tilood recum- j
lafcttaei th^ feik?*- members cf the groat* for
â¢xi<enni<.-nt. <in similar lines. The condition, of
raiiroed trcftic- is pronounced to be un
tr> c edcctt-4 in the expt-rience of the oldest
cia.!:afc-i=rs who pri'fcsÃ to b? making every ef
l<jrt_ in thf!r j>ower to avoid- commuting their
companies to greater obligations for iram-por
tttion. being quite overwhelmed by the traffic
now ofltrin^f.
The. utklr.* of profits on the day's rise im
j'airefl the gains considerably* and the closing

WASHINGTON', Oct. 23. â To-day's state
ment of the Treasury balances in the general

Available cash balances, $131,237,393; gold
coin and bullion, $76,334,702; gold certificates,

.New York Cotton Market.
NEW YORK. Oct. 23.â The market made
another advance to-day. The weather over
Sunday was very unfavorable, the advices
reporting frosts over a large portion of the
Eastern belt, with temperatures .in a few
places down to 32 degrees. It is impossible
to tell how much damage was done,' although
it is 'claimed to be serious in some localities.
In spite of heavy realizing the market main
tained a very firm tone, accentuated by- the
expectation that the .census report on cotton
ginned to October 10 will show about 4.500,000
baits. There is said to be an improving de
mand for spot cotton from exporters and mills.
The report by the Weather Bureau of kill
ing frosts caused a wave of buying, on which
prices advanced 1C to 17 points. The market
reacted moderately, however, on rather liberal
profit taking and on Belling from a quarter
from which large crop estimates have eman
ated.
There is good demand for spot cotton abroad
with sales of 8000 bales at an advance of 8
points to 5.C2. The sharp rise, in the Eng
lish market is attributed to the cold weather
over the belt Sunday night and Sunday. Ac
cording to the Government weather reports
Issued last night heavy to klllnlg frosts oc
curred in the northern part of the East Gulf
and South Atlantic States and light frosts oc
curred at most shores of the gulf.
Dallas, Texas, wires: "We are reliably In
formed that the National Ginners are out and
make 45 per cent of the crop ginned 4,453,900."

CHICAGO BOARD Oft TRADE.
Future Grain and Provlalonsw
CHICAGO, Oct. 23. â Higher prices for
wheat at Liverpool had a steadying effect to
day on the wheat market here. The market
was steady the entire session, notwithstanding
a bearish attitude on the part of pit traders.
Buying of the . May delivery by . commission
houses was a feature of trading. Another
feature was support of December by a leading
long. The firm tone of the Liverpool mar
ket, said to be due : to an advance of 6d in
RuEsian off erincs, imparted more or leas firm
ness to the market . her from I the start, initial
quotations on December being a' shade. to 4@
%c higher at 87%Â©87% c. . Weekly statistics
were considered bearish. The amount, of bread
stuffs on passage for the week Increased 1,488,
000 bushels compared with the total for the
previous week.. There was an almost similar'
amount of decrease for the corresponding weejc
of last year.- World's shipments were liberal,
totaling 12,016,000 bushels, against 10,673j000
bushels last week and 10,920,000 bushels a /ear
ago. / a.
\u25a0 The bears, however, were held In checjs^by
demand from a.promlnent, bull who bought on
every indication of a slump In: values. For
' December the range In prices for the day was"
confined within 4c, . the lowest point being
reached at 86% c. Opening quotations marked
the highest point . of the day. The \u25a0 close was
! steady with December selling at 86%Â©-87 c .. \
A sharp advance In' the price : of corn , at
Liverpool caused firmness in the market for
that cereal here. Selling of December by a lo
; cal packer was a feature of. trading. -The
market closed firm. December opened., %c .to
40' Vie higher 'at 45c to 45@45%c, sold off; to
44T^c and closed at 44%045c. . f-
Qirength was manifested In the oats market.
One of the principal causes; was* a cablegram
all c-fring that the Russian Government had de
cided to prohibit the exportation of oats from
Baltic ports, one commission house being ac
credited with purchases of .. . over r 1,000,000
bushels. The market closgd' at practically .the
highest point of the day.- December opened < a
shade to J/s@%c higher at 29V6c to 29% c. sold

llutter, Cheese and Eggs.
The Dairy Exchange opened Informally yes
terday. It had not been tno intention to begin
the regular sessions for the establishment of
tho dally ; market until November 1, but tho
attendance was so large â thirty houses â and
the desire to do business co keen that the mem
bers found themselves bidding and asking their
prices for Butter, Cheese and Eggs so actively
that they decided to accepx the figures as the
market quotations for the day. The first sale
was of five cast-e of extra creamery Butter at
31 %c. For Choice mild new Cheese 13 YjC was
bid and refused. The surprise of the session
was the sudden Jump In Eggs, buyers running
tho market for fancy up xo 4Sc without get
ting any. The fact Is, there are practically no
fresh ranch Eggs of extra, quality in. town.
The session of the Exchange, contrary to all
expectations, completely destroyed streetTJricea
and put them all at 6ea, hence they must, for
the ' moment at least, be considered largely
nominal. The new method of conducting . the
Exchange la completely different from the old,
as on this Exchange the actual transactions
mako- the market, whereas on the Exchange
which existed some years ago there were no
transactions. The trade are very enthusiastic
over, tho new Exchange, and if it- works here
after regularly as well as it did yesterday'in
formally it will undoubtedly be a great success
and of incalculable benest ,to the Dairy trade
of the whole coast. \u25a0 The sessions will be con
tinued to-day.
Receipts were 54.000 lbs Butter, BSOO, lbs
Cheese and 763 cases Eggs.

.v;-f. Deciduous and Citrus Fruits..
The market for fresh fruits opened tho week
with trade of average proportions and quota
tlos showed but little change from Saturday's
closing prices. Table Grapes were generally
easy, receipts being liberal and the carry-over
from Saturday large. Small packages were
relatively weaker than large boxes, as there
was no shipping demand and the large packers
found the most favor with local buyers. There
was a little better movement reported In fancy
Apples, but ' prices Bhowed no Improvement,
supplies being well , up to requirements. The
other orchard fruits were quoted steady to firm
at previous prices. Melons \u25a0 were dull nt Ir
regular rates, being mostly iof poor quality.
Large - Strawberries and Raspberries were In
light receipt and the best lots met with prompt
sale at higher prices. There were no Long
worth Strawberries or Blackberries received.
In the Citrus market Oranges and Grape Fruit
ruled firm and Lemone were steadier. The car

CLOSE INQUIRY
INTO DISASTER
Inspectors Bolles and Bul
ger Finish the Investiga
tion of Wreck of St. Paul
CAPTADTS EXPLANATION
Says Deviation of Tide May
Have Been Cause of the
Vessel Going on Bocks
The Inquiry Into the wreck of the
steamer St. Paul, which struck on the
rocks near Point Gorda on October 6,
was closed before Inspectors Bolles
and. Bulger yesterday. Though there
was a lisrht drizzling rain falling at
the time, the weather was comparative
ly clear when she went upon the hid
den rocks.
"On your oath you say there was no
indication that the ship was too close
in 'Shore?" asked Inspector Bolles of
Third Orficer William Holmes, who was
In chargre when the vessel struck.
"Yes, sir," replied Holmes.
"Were there any charts on the
bridge?" inquired Inspector Bulger.
"No. sir; there were none," replied l
Holmes.
"What do you believe was the reason
that the ship went upon the rocks?"
Captain C. Randall was asked. ; â¢
"Possibly because of the deviation in
the currents," was the reply.
Second Mate H. Johnson, who pre
ceded Holmes, was asked if he could
see land plainly just after the ship
struck. He replied that he could.
"Could you see the breakers?" was
asked.
"Yes. sir," he replied.
"Were you in your usual course?"
"Yes, sir; we have taken that course
for fifteen trips that I know of."
"Have you ever been inside the light
Â«hip before?"
"Yes, sir; once or twice."
"How far did you pass off Fort
Bragg?"
"About nine miles."
"How far did you expect to pass the
lightship?"
"Rather close."
On cross-questioning by Inspector
Bulger Johnson admitted that the bear
ings he took at Fort Bragg could not
be absolutely accurate.
Albert Winslow, quartermaster, was j
at the wheel when the St. Paul struck. |
He testified that he could see nothing, j
as the windows of the pilot-house were
closed.
"Were you given orders to " change j
your course at any time?" asked In- I
spector Bulger.
"No, sir." he answered. "Not until I
the struck." ,
\u25a0'What were the orders then?"
"Hard a-starboard."
"Did the vessel respond any?"
"About four or five points, I think."
Quartermaster George Robbler was
next called.
"Could you see the breakers?"
"1 could hear the roll of the break- j
ers."
"Why didn't you see the land when
it was so close?"- Holmes was asked
when called to the stand.
"Before the ship struck I didn't see j
the lar.d very well," was the reply.
"You thought that you were the j
us^ual distance off shore?"
"Yes, sir."
"How close have you passed Point !
Gorda before?"
"About a mile."
"Did you hear people testify here j
that the vessel was getting closer to
*hore all the timer* Captain Randall
was asked.
"Yes, sir."
"Do you think that if you had got
out at 2:05 when the mate called you j
that you would have made any change <
in the nositlon of the vessel?"
"I can't say."
The result of the inquiry will not be ;
made public for some time.
ORDERS DESTRUCTION" OF
IMPURE HAMS A.\D BACOX
Health Official* Compel J. William* to
Pour Coal Oil on Goods in
Hlk PoÂ«Â»eÂ«sion.
Market Inspector Campbell yesterday
seized a wagon load of ham and bacon
that was unfit for human consumption
and detained a man giving the name of
J. Williams, who was driving the
wagon. A companion of Williams, who
was on the wagon seat, made his es
cape when he saw trouble coming.
Campbell took Williams and the
hams to the City Hall, where Health
Officer Ragan and Chief Sanitary In
spector Hassler questioned Williams at
length as to where he had procured the
stuff. Williams told a rambling story
that a woman had bought the hams in
San Jose and he was going to ship
them to Sacramento for her. He de
nied that he intended to sell them in
this city.
After Ragan and Hassler had con
demned the hams and bacon, which
were found to be decayed. Williams
was given the alternative of voluntar
ily pouring coal oil on the stuff or of
submitting to arrest for having impure
food in his possession. Williams
poured the coal oil from a flask given
to him by Campbell on the stuff and
he was allowed to go.

WeilL Former Mayor. E: B. Pond, George Center, Frank H. Gould, John S. Partridge and Henry U. Branden -

SAYS REFORMERS
ARE DISHONEST
3layor Schmitz Maintains
Fusionists Are Euled by
Political .Manipulators
"The so-called reform which the fusion
ists are advocating is. a reform at the
hands of the dishonest political manipu
lators of this city," declared Mayor
Schmitz last night. "I "am. in this fight
for a .principle, and when I say that the
struggle Is between the plain people, as
represented by me and the. rest of the
candidates on the Union Labor party
ticket, and the Citizens' Alliance, as rep
resented by the fusion ticket, I am telling
the truth, and I believe that the voters
of this city will indorse me with their
votes. lam not making a personal fight;
I am fighting for the election of the
whole ticket. Elect us. and then see
what reforms will be carried through.
"My election four years ago was an ex
periment. The wage earners took a
chance. Now things are altogether dif
ferent. My administration has been at
tacked and has been proved an honest
one. The people know that by the re
election of this ticket future domestic
peace and prosperity are assured. There
can be but one resultâ our victory on
November 7."
Mayor Schmitz spoke at three meetings
last night and was greeted by well-filled
halls at each of them. He first went to
Strycker's Hall, where P. H. McCarthy
introduced him as "one whom I have j
learned to love" This was quite a rare j
bit of news to those who remembered
the position of McCarthy two years ago. j
Mayor Schmitz defended his action in |
the matter of the stone quarry of Gray
Bros, in this district by saying that he
could do nothing else and act in the j
cause of justice.
Symposium Hall was presided over by
Chairman Doyle. Schmitz was heartily
cheered as he entered the building. .
The last meeting of the evening was
held in a small hall near Fourth and
Perry streets, in the Twenty-ninth Dis
trict. The hall was well filled.
Yesterday afternoon Mayor Schmitz
visited the" glass works at Sixteenth and
Howard streets and shook hands with the
employes. Later he visited the whole
sale district. He expressed surprise at
the number of Schmitz buttons he saw
there.
COLORED REGIMENT
ORDERED TO MANILA
Twenty - Fourth Infantry
Will Go to Islands
for Duty.
The Twenty-fourth Infantry, colored,
has received orders to sail for Manila
on January 1. The First Infantry will
remain on the coast. The sending of
colored troops to the Philippines de
notes a change in the policy of the
United States Government as it has
been nearly six years since a colored
regiment was sent to the islands. The
negro soldiers took up with the native
women very readily, who, generally,
pursuaded them to desert the army and
join the rebel bands. For this reason
the War Department decided to recall
all the colored troops then stationed
there and replace them by white men.
The change in the policy is the cause of
great rejoicing among the white
troops, who have had more than their
share of island duty.
The transport Buford, having the
Fourteenth Cavalry on board, sailed
from Manila on her homeward trip
October 20. The Logan, also on her
homeward trip, arrived in Honolulu
October 22.
Assistant Surgeon C. H. Connor, sta
tioned at Fort Stevens, Oregon, is in
the city on a leave of absence.
Lieutenant O. C. Troxel of the Tenth
Cavalry, now stationed at Fort Robin

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY. OCTOBER 2-k 1905.
PARTRIDGE DEFIES GANG'S
VILE INTIMIDATIONS.
Neither Obscene Letters Nor Hired Thugs
Will Keep Him From Duty.
Fusion Leader Talks to Voters During
Afternoon and Night Meetings.
Lyric Hall, in the heart of the tender
loin, surrounded by red lights and il
luminated Schmitz signs, was packed last
night with voters of the Forty-third and
! Forty-fourth districts- who crowded' the
i floor, galleries, aisles and entrances to
hear John S. Partridge champion the
cause of municipal reform. Prominent
in the audience, were boys of the First
J California National Guard in uniform.
Second only to Partridge in sharing the
plaudits of the throng was Henry U.
Brandenstein, who is making a superb
fight t for the Fusion ticket. Dr. John F.
Dillon, the idol of the laboring man,
was also warmly greeted.
The speech that Mr. Partridge made
last night will ring in the ears of his
hearers and set them pondering upon the
means of ridding the city of the mass oÂ£
I corruption, and it is safe' to predict that
'the "straight from the shoulder" speech
of Partridge compared to the vacillating
replies of his opponent has won ever
' many votes for the great majority that
| fusion will pile up on November 7.
Partridge's eyes flashed as he spoke of
the attacks by letter and epithet that
| had been made upon him and he advised
j his opponent to withdraw the thug that
is constantly shadowing him. Mr. Part-
I ridge spoke as follows:
1 It is strange indeed that there should en
! dure even . for a moment, such a partnership
: as exists between the Mayor of this city anu
Mr. Ruef. The very first thing the Mayor did
after his election was to announce to the pub
lic that his favor was to be sought in th*
office of that gentleman. This wpuld hay&
been astounding, unprecedented, intolerable if
Mr. Ruef had been an attorney of the ver>
highest standing. The people ' did not know
Mr. Ruof's full character then, but they did
know that he was a politician of the most
objectionable type. But the only feeling dis
played throughout the city was surprise,
mingled with disgust and apprehension.
That this apprehension was well - founded
the events of the Mayor's first two years
amply proved. It became notorious . that al
most anything which It was. in the power ot
the Mayor to grant could be secured by see
ing Ruef." But the business of this delectablft
co-partnership was somewhat hampered by
the fact that they did not have control of
all the commissioners. They had appointed
men who would do their bidding and ask no
que=tions. A few men who were decent and
who would not submit to their nefarious prao-
I tices were put in office, but they were very
j quickly dropped. No man of any mind or
I conscience could long endure the methods of
i such an administration and the administration
had no use for men of mind or conscience.
! The business of the city, of course, was
shamefully neglected. But it was noruntll.
by division In the forceg of decency, the ad
ministration was again returned to power, thai
thÂ» abilities of the Mayor's favored attorn ej
found full scope. Then, with all the com
missioners absolutely under his control, he en
tered upon a practice such br the most gitteo
' advocate at the bar could never hope to at
! tain !n a lifetime of effort. .
' The whole city knew, at the time that tne
Mayor was nominated for his second term.
, that this partnership existed, and what the
: business cf this partnership must be. Yet
\u25a0 thousands of men. of honest life and decent
: instincts and honorable purposes, voted in
: favor of its continuance. It. is true that
i a majority of citizens did not; but it is equally
i true thai a very small percentage of those
i who did could really be called corrupt The
j reat were careless or deceived, â¢or blinded by
â¢ other considerations.
i You have chosen me to voice your dlsap
\u25a0 proval and to lead your forces against the
i corruptionlsts. and I am going to do my duty.
: Xay more, whether I am elected or not, I am
I going to keep up the fight at the ballot-box,
' in the courts, everywhere, until San Francisco
is cleansed of the vileness that disgraces her.
and makes her name a reproach and byword
among the cities of the country. And I want
ito say this to the gangsters: You might as
i well stop writing me anonymous and ob
scene letters; you might as well stop hurling
vil- epithets at me in public meetings; you
mi*ht as well stop whispering foul lies about
! me- you niight as well stop hiring thugs to
foM'ow me about at . night; for no power on
earth ehall hinder me. as spokesman of the
peoi>le from telling the world what is in the
public" mind, and from denouncing your evil
! way? wherever I can get anybody to, listen.
! I charge the present administration with ae
i liberate promotion of lawlessness and riot. I
i suppose that no other city in the country has
I ever beheld the spectacle of its chief executive
going into a public assemblage and. inciting a
lot of half-grown youths to violence and de
struction of property, as the Mayor of this
city did on the night of the newsboys' meet
ing \u25a0 What can we expect from these poor
lads who are compelled to earn their -llvinif
by the sale of papers, when they are urged and
incited to break the law? Children who are
compelled to be on the streets by the grim
necessity of "earning their bread are subjecteJ
to tempation â¢ enough at all times. Tsut what
kind of citizens can we expect them to become
when thÂ»>y are given a license to assault and
breach of the peace? The very nature of their
calling develops their manhood and inde
pendence, and most of them in the past have
become useful citizens. But no lad can be
made into a good citizen unless he is taught
to obey the law.
Well might the leaders of labor protest. Well
might Mr. Walter Mac Arthur say: "This is
not a labor union fight, but many, well-mean
ing people hold organized labor responsible for
the shameful \u25a0 scene* being enacted "in our
streets. To correct this crying evil the Labor
Council should go on record that It Is now and
always will be for law and order." >'
Those are manly words, and every right
thinking man must Indorse them. Such men
as Mac Arthur and Furuseth and- Samuel
Gompers know that the lawa of . this country
must be upheld. lam going to devote myself
to the task of seeing that they are upheld.
The real, thoughtful leaders of the union labor
movement know that their movement needs
nothing but fair treatment. |If I am elected I
am going to uphold the law; and if I am de
feated I am going to make it the business of
my life to see that others obey it.
Prior to Mr. Partridge's entrance Henry
U. Brandenstein fired hot shot at his op
ponents and every telling point was
warmly indorsed by the audience, iHe
arraigned the administration in forceful
sterms and bitterly resented the vile as
persion cast upon . his personal honor. .
Great attention was paid to the remarks
of Dr. J. F. Dillon, who told of! his per
sonal encounters with the grafters while
serving on the Board of Health. He
spoke In part as follows:
At this time and In such a fight as this
one spirit should animate all and bring .to
gether under the banner of civic decency those
of all politics and all creeds. I do not arise
here with the intention of making a campaign
speech. I simply want to tell my experiences
with the grafters and â¢to solemnly warn you
of the dangers that exist while the city has a
biased Board of â¢ Health. .In â¢ heart or spirit
they are not American, for . they defer to -the j
will of a boss. \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0:' "- N
When I" was in the Board of : Health 1 tried i
to compel the dairymen to do their duty. I
was fold by them that the Board of Health
was a one-man board, and j when I insisted on
having: Inspectors visit the, dairies', l was told
that I was ' usurping my authority. Nothirfg
can affect . the people more', than impure food
and, worst of, all,' bad milk. ' ; :
â¢ I say to you that the ' evil ; of impure-milk'
can be eradicated. : Given two inspectors, . two
chemists and a column in the '\u25a0\u25a0 dally ; papers In
whichito publish the names of the firms Helling
adulterated milk, , and I*\u25a0 say \u25a0 to .. you that not
one sale of bad milk would . be made. \u25a0\u25a0 If the
work of the Board ;of Health Is , so 1 bad. . what
must be the condition of the other commissions?
. . ' And H ' la < not \u25a0 milk alone. .1 asked for five

poisoned meat. I asked for five detectives and
two inspectors and guaranteed that thousands
of dollars' worth of diseased meat would be
prevented, from being sold. The County Med
ical Society offered to send its best physicians
for duty free of cost to the city, but the offer
was refused. For a few paltry dollar* ob
tained by graft the administration would sac
rifice the lives of thousands.
I am a physician and I know whereof I
speak. Throughout San Francisco there are

PARTRIDGE ADDRESSES WORKERS
Large Crowd Listens Ko Leader at
.Fourteenth and Harrison Streets.
John S. Partridge, the fusion candi
date for Mayor, added to his popularity
in the labor section of 'the city yes
terday noon and increased the num
ber of workingmen that will give him
their votes on election day. When Mr.
Partridge began speaking at Four
teenth street and Harrison in the open
there were but fifty people on hand,
but within ten minutes over three hun
dred had gathered to. listen to the
standard bearer, and he was frequently
cheered.
Contrary to the expectations of some,
there ' was no Interruption of the
speaker excepting a few dissenting
cries, but after the talk many met Mr.
Partridge and shook hands, assuring
him of their support. :> >
\u25a0 From his' rostrum, an empty wagon,
Partridge made an earnest appeal to
the workers "for their friendship and
good will regardless of how they were
going to .vote. He told them that he
preferred to have them knbw him as
a fair,, square man, and that if they be
lieved he would give them a just ad
ministration he wanted their votes.
Speaking of 'his own life and work,
the candidate told them of his own
hard life of toil while attempting to
provide for his loved ones and educate
himself. He assured them that every
dollar he owned he himself had earned,
and asked them if they thought a man
who had worked all his life would for
get the trials and temptations of a
worklngman and fail to sympathize
with them. \u0084
He further told them of the mlsgov
ernment / that San Francisco, is under
going ajid. that graft existed through
out the various commissions to such
an extent as to make the city a byword
throughout the country.. He promised
his hearers that if he were elected he
would clean out every grafter and
boodler and place honest men in their ;
places so that the city, might raise her
head.
REFORMER IN THE FORTY-SECOND
-MismanaKement in Arranging Meeting
Keeps Many Voters Away.
That rrfDre people did not turn out
to Loughead Hall in the Forty-second
district last night may be attributed
to mismanagement of the meeting. The
failure to duly advertise the meeting
and the non-appearance ,of a band,
capped by the absence of the chairman
of the evening, kept down the attend
ance. As it was,. the seats were nearly
all filled and enough were standing at
the back of the hair to fill \u25a0 the re
mainder. , . '
What the audience lacked in num
bers it made up In enthusiasm and the
greetings extended the candldates'were
very cordial. Henry U. Brandenstein
shared the honors with Partridge. The
latter was introduced' by Sidney Van
Wyck, who acted as chairman.
;>*Mr.' Partridge told of the failures of
the present administration' in its. civic,
duties, j He arraigned the gangsters
and defied them \u25a0â*â¢*â¢..'Â».- their worst,.'even
to murder. He advised 'them, to cease
writing, him obscene, letters, hurling
vile epithets and employing thugs to
shadow aim, "for he predicted his own
election and the triumph of the fusion
ticket by 15,000 majority. He told. his
hearers that nothing short of .death
would stop him in the fight and as
sured them that if by a possibility he
were defeated he would continue the
fight against ''Ruef until San Francisco
was" freed from the defiling grasp of
the ring. ;- - ' :
He also said that throughout this
campaign he had said what , he firmly
believed all the people think. He; added
that -at any great crisis of . affairs,
when the; public .mind t is inflamed; by
some great :. evil 'l or 1- injustice, the peo
ple are j accustomed to put^forward one
of : their \u25a0 number â¢ as their spokesman,"
. and predicted woe to j him ; if; he speaks
not -truly. The spokesman of peq-'
pie, 'he > continued, must forget that
there is such a thing as consequences,
and speak V his inmost convictions,
which will be the universal, sense. ',â¢;'

RAPHAEL WEILL
WILL PRESIDE
Fusion Campaign Committee
Arranges for Another Mass
Meeting at the Alhambra
The general awakening: of citizens to
the Importance of the municipal elec
tion and- the enthusiasm of the young
men in the Republican and Democratic
organizations foreshadow the triumph
of John S. Partridge at the polls on No
vember 7. Onlookers of the battle have
said from the outset that Ruef and
Schmitz would go down to defeat if
the leaders of the fusion campaign
could excite sufficient interest in the
contest to bring to the election booths
â¢the so-called "stay at" homes," who
seldom vote at other than Presidential
| elections.
j Reports recently received from every
Assembly district of the city convince
the fusion campaign committee that
thousands of citizens who ordinarily
neglect ,the civic duty of voting will
go to the polls two weeks from to-day
and swing the lever for Partridge. The
fusion nominee is steadily, gaining in
public favor. Many a voter who was
In doubt at , the beginning Is now
openly advocating Partridge. The talk
of the town Is for Partridge. The dis
tricts won by the Republican' League
will cast immense majorities for Part
ridge. Politicians who have studied
the situation would not be surprised if
the Thirty-seven.th Assembly District
gave Partridge 2500 majority. Heavy
majorities .in the Thirty-eighth, For
tieth, Forty-first, Forty-second and
.Forty-third districts are regarded as
certain. The Thirty-fourth and Thir
ty-fifth districts will roll up handsome
majorities for Partridge.
The notion entertained by many men
of the betting fraternity that the vote
cast for Schmitz in 1903 was very
nearly equal to the combined vote
thrown to Lane and Crocker is far from
correct. The vote is thus officially re
corded in the Municipal Reports:
Schmitz . .26.050
Crocker . ; '..19.609
*.ane . 12.580
Whitney . 1094
Scattering 4
It will be noted that Crocker and
Lane together received 32,189 votes, or
6139 more than Schmitz received. Care
ful inquiries lead to the positive belief
that Partridge'will receive as large a
percentage of the Democratic vote as
Lane obtained. The grafters are con
tending that one-half of the Demo
cratic vote outside of the United Labor
party will go to Schmitz. Democrats
who are fighting gallantly in the cause
of common honesty are convinced that
the 12,000 Democrats who supported
Tobin in 1901 and Lane in 1903 will
not under any conditions vote for
Schmitz.
Another mass meeting of. citizens under
the auspices of the fusion campaign com
mittee will be held at Alhambra Theater
to-morrow night. Raphael TVeill. one of
the most Influential and popular mer
chants of San Francisco, will be the pre
siding officer. E. B. Pond, who served
the city as Supervisor and as Mayor,
with credit to himself and honor to the
community, will speak to his fellow citi
zens. Other leading men, George Center,
Frank H. Gould, John S. Partridge and
H. U. Brandenstein, will speak. Topics
relating to the possibilities of San Fran
cisco -under fair conditions of local gov
ernment will be discussed. Special ref
erence, will be made to the subject of
bonds.
The organization committee of the San
Francisco Republican Leagueâ George D.
Clark (chairman), Daniel A. Ryan (secre
tary). Fairfax H. Wheelan, David Rich,
John D. Daly, E. J. Bowes. John Lack
mann and Richard J. "Welchâ held a ses
sion at party headquarters last night.
This committee organized the Republican
forces that achieved the splendid v^rtory
at the primary election in August last,
and is working with zeal and energy to
bring to the polls on November 7 every
voter who desires a clean and progressive
administration of â¢ municipal affairs.
â¢ A standing committee on civic righte
ousness # was revived yesterday by the
Methodist ministers at their weekly
meeting, held in Central Methodist Epis
copal Church, Mission street.
So keen has become the sentiment of
that body for a stalwart and unstained
city administration that there was a big
attendance, Including ministers formerly
.resident in San Francisco, who take a
lively Interest in the present conditions.
The committee, which consists of the
Rev. A. C. Bane, D.D. ; the Rev. Francis
M. Larkin, Ph.D., and Dr. F. D. BovardT
editor of the California Christian, Advo
cate, was empowered to investigate and
present at a future meeting the names of
candidates for indorsement.

FORGERY RING
IS BROKEN UP
Secret Service Agent Helms
Finds Portuguese Grafters
Working oil False Papers
THEEE AEEESTS 3IADE
They Charge Fifty Dollars
for Naturalizing Men
Without Going to Court
Palpitation of the heart in a very
severe form attacked United States
Secret Service Asent John H. Helms a
few days ago when he j learned that a
ring of Portuguese sharpers had been
selling forged naturalization certificates
to some of their more ignorant country
men. /
That they had continued in their un
lawful" business as late as the 16th of
the present' month, notwithstanding the
numerous arrests that had been made by
Agent Helms during the last three
months, was almost incomprehensible and
could be explained only on the theory
that the grafters were themselves ig
norant and did not read the daily papers.
Agent Helms learned that on the date
mentioned George Oliveiria of the firm
of Silva & Oliveiria, clothing dealers on
Jackson street, in the city front district,
and Antonio Santos, a laborer in the
Custom-house, had sold to Jose Ignacio
Brazil a forged certificate of naturaliza
tion bearing the seal of the Superior
Court of San Francisco and purporting
to have been issued by "Superior Judge
J." M. Gregory ojt Department No. 14."
The name "Alix Dunne" is signed to the
document as Deputy County Clerk.
It appears that Brazil intended to make
a trip to Europ*e and desired to be nat
uralized before he left this country so
as to avoid any difficulty on returning.
Oliveiria told him that Santos could get
him naturalized without any trouble, and
Brazil, being Ignorant of the niceties of
American laws, innocently fell Into the
trap. After having asked him as to the
length of his residence here they told
him that they would attend to the matter
and would obtain the papers for him
more cheaply than he could , himself.
Two days later they handed him the
forged papers and received J5O from
Brazil
Brazil subsequently showed the paper
to his lady friend, who happened to be
a reader of the newspapers, and she
brought the document to Agent Helms.
The result was the arrest of the two
schemers and the postponement of Bra
zil's trip to Europe. A barber named J.
Martinho was also arrested as an ac
cessory, but I was released on his own
recognizance at the suggestion of Agent
Helms. Damaging evidence was found
in Oliveiria's possession, showing that for
a long time he had been engaged in the
business of selling forged certificates of
naturalization to his illiterate country
men.
COOK'S CALENDAR IS
\u25a0NOW VIRTUALLY CLEAR
Judge Will Work if Lawlor
Will Send to Country
for Him.
Judge Cook has the distinction of be
ing the only Jurist since the Superior
courts were inaugurated -in this city
and county to have his trial calendar
virtually cleared. He has a case set
for October 26. but it will be continued
owing to the absence of defendant's at
torney. Another trial Is set for Oc
tober 30. and a third for December 11.
These three cases are all he has on the
calendar.
After disposing of the cases on his
calendar yesterday the Judge addressed
the jurors who were present and said:
That disposes of all of the cases on the
calendar of this court and you gentlemen
need not return again till you are notified by
postal card by the clerk of the court. There
Is no use In Incurring expense In bringing you
to court when there Is nothing for you to do.
I shall go to the country till the presiding
Judge finds. It convenient to assign some cases
to this department. When that is done the
clerfc can send me word to Sonoma County. I
believe this la the first instance on record In
the Superior courts when the entire calendar
of a deoartment was cleared off.
The case of Ancio Brisillo, charged
with the murder of Joseph Brogardo
on Vandewater street last January, was
eet' .for trial yesterday, but owing 1 to
the absence of material witnesses It
was continued till October 28 to be set.
In the case of Michael J. McCarthy,
who pleaded guilty to a charge of mur
der for shooting and killing his wife,
Octavia, the Judge said he had given
the case very careful consideration and
could not overlook the fact that it had
been tried by a jury and the jury had
disagreed as to the degree of the
crime. If the defendant had pleaded
guilty before the case .went" to trial he
might have found him guilty of murdar
in the first degree, but in view of the
disagreement of the jury and when
there was a doubt as to the degree it
must be resolved in favor of the de
fendant. In consideration of thesa
facts and in view of the testimony,
which he had carefully perused, he
would find the defendant guilty of
murder in the second degree. Sentence
was deferred till Friday.

BELLBOY CHARGED WITH BURGLARY.
Grover Trimmer, a- bellboy, -tyas booked at
the City. Prison yesterday by Detectives Mathe
son and Mulcahy on. a charge of burglary.
On October 18 Mrs. Mary Coppeck t one of tha
guests at the Knickerbocker Hotel, 1606 Vaa [
Ness avenue, went to a matinee and left
the key of her room with Trimmer, who wÂ»Â»
running the elevator. When she returned
Trimmer had disappeared and . she found that
about $600 worth of her Jewelry was also
missing. The stolen Jewelry has not yet been
recovered, but the police say they have suf
ficient evidence to convict Trimmer of the
hnrelarv. \u25a0 \u25a0 . . >
