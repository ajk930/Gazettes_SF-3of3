â During the second bombard

while the Japanese fleet engaged
the Russian ships, the Japanese
partly landed frqrn four trans
ports, 3500 soldiers in all, at Bic!

them to land. Then they made a
grand charge with artillery, in
fantry and cavalry, principally.
Cossacks and coast guards, and
almost annihilated the Japanese,
who were unprepared for an at

at the place of landing. The bat

It was reported on Wednesday

The forts at Kinchau opened fire,
but the battleships, being beyond
reach, did not reply and retired.
Kinchau is a. strong fort com

CALL CORRESPONDENT VIEWS CHEMULPO BATTLE
JAPAN PLANNING
TO TAKE REVENGE
Nation Is Deeply Stirred by Russian
* *
TOKIO. Feb. 14--Japan is deeply
Etlrred and bitterly resentful over the
sinking of the merchant vessel Zensho
Maru by four Russian cruisers, which
on Thursday attacked the Zensho Maru
and her companion, the Nakamura
Ma ru, while they were on their way
from Hakata to Otaru, on the island
of Hakkaido. The attack of the Rus
sians is declared to have been a wan
ton crime, unjustified under any cir
cumstances, even assuming that the
Zensho Maru disregarded signals, which
Is denied.
The Foreign Office Issued thetollow
ing statement regarding the sinking of
the Zensho Maru:
â  "Two Japanese merchant vessels, the
Zensho Maru and the Makamura Maru,
tonnage 170 and 700 respectively, while
sailing from Hakata for Otaru. were
suddenly attacked by four Russian
cruisers from Vladivostok on February
11 when ten miles off Jansangtu. FirÂ«
was opened without any order being
given the vessels to surrender. The
Xakamura Maru succeeded in escaping.
.The other vessel was surrounded by
the cruisers and sunk. All on board
vere either killed or drowned."
It is said the Japanese Government
is planning reprisals. Several Russian
ships that have been detained In order
to prevent reports of the movements
ot the Japanese reaching the enemy
will now, it is said, be sent to the prize
courts and all probably will be con
fiscated.
The presence of Russian squadrons
in Northern Japanese waters centers
all interest there. * The country Is iso
lated and it 1s difficult to obtain satis
factory reports from there.
RUMOR OF BOMBARDMENT.
A variety of rumors are stirring
Tckio. One says that Matsumaye has
b?en bombarded and another that Jap
anese cruisers have. engaged the Rus
sians. The 'Government has not con
firmed anything except the Zensho
Maru incident.
It is doubted that Matsumaye 'has
been bombarded, because it is un
defended. It is regarded as probable
that the Russian fleet either returned
U) Vladivostok after completing a
movement planned to divert the Jap
anese or else passed through the Tsu
gara Straits, moving southward.
Th% - Japanese cruiser squadron is
6coiiting in the hope of locating the
Russian fleet. If the Russians should
attempt to effect a Junction with the
Port Arthur fleet the Japanese will
attempt to block the way and force an
engagement.
The Japanese Government has de
cided to accept the parole of France
for the Russian prisoners captured at
Chemulpo, at the time of the sinking
of the Variag and Korutz, provided
they be sent to Shanghai. Russia en
gages not to let them come north of
Shanghai until the end of the war. An
exception is made in the case of twenty
wounded men aboard the French
steamer Pascal. They will be taken to
Chef u and placed in a hospital.
Baron de Rosen, the Russian Minis
ter, withdrew from the capital at 9
o'clock Thursday night Lines of
mounted police guarded and- kept
clear the streets from the legation to
the Shinbashi station, where the Min
ister entrained. The crowds were not
difficult to handle, but were good
naturedly intent on celebrating the
success of the Japanese navy. The
diplomatic staffs and many friends.
both Japanese and foreign, assembled
at the station and bade Baron de
Rosen farewell, with - a ceremony
somewhat mournful. The police
guarded the train and accompanied
the Russian Minister and party to
Yokohama, where it embarked on the
French steamship Yarra, which sailed
at 9 o'clock Friday morning.
PAVLOFF LEAVES VOLUNTARILY
The Japanese Government denies
that Pavloff, Russian Minister to
Korea, withdrew from Seoul on Fri
day under Japanese pressure, claiming
that his withdrawal was entirely vol
untary. It is said that Pavloff.
through the French Minister. Inti
mated a desire to leave Seoul and en
trust Russian affairs to the care of
the French legation and have placed
a French guard around the legation.
The Japanese Government acqui
esced in this arrangement and ar
ranged so that when Pavloff left the
legation to-day soldiers Instead of po
lice guarded the route to the station,
where a special train to Chemulpo was
supplied. An officer escorted Pavloff
to Pascal. The Japanese fleet- was

- The foregoing disclaimer by Japan
indicates that, despite the fact * that
Korea Is largely dominated by the
Japanese military force, the Govern
ment has no intention at present of
trsumlnr territorial possession.
Wednesday night's celebration over
the naval victory â¢ at Port Arthur far
exceeded that of the day in noisy en
thusiasm. Early In the evening Im
promptu processions of thousands of
men began to form and paraded
through the principal streets and
surged about the public buildings and
the palace, carrying banners and
cheering wildly. The Russian legation

demonstration was made there by the
immense crowds constantly passing it.
but : :arcn de Rosen's associates plain
1;- heard the din and noi.s of "e tri
umphant people. Bands, drums and
horns added volume to the cheers of
the noisy populace. Every reveler
carried a lantern, flag or transparency.
The people have been restrained and
calm for so many months that they
are pouring out their long pent-up
feelings Into a wildly enthusiastic cel
ebration of victory. It was Manila,
Ladysmith and Santiago nights du

/, CHEFU. Feb. 14.â It Is reported that
32.000 Japanese troops were landed at
Dove Bay last Wednesday morning and
that they were met by the Russians,
who engaged them in a hand-to-hand
fight. The report says the Japanese
were driven back. It also is reported
that Japanese troops have been landed
forty miles farther west.
Passengers who have arrived at Port
Arthur eay the Russian cruiser Askold
was damaged in Tuesday's battle In
the roads outside of Port Arthur, but
was kept afloat until Saturday; â¢â¢ when
she sank in thirty fathoms.
The Russians . have explained their
reasons for firing on the British steam
ship Fuping and wounding three of the
Chinese crew. They, assert that the
vessel was leaving port without
clearing. *TRyFKÂ£lfjiJljHÂ»lilfll'

Captain Gundarsen of the, Norwegian
collier Bygde has been* imprisoned- at
Port Arthur for four days for having
in his possession a chart of the 7 Sing
Yang Tan coalingr station west of Port
Arthur, and showing the chart to the
Japanese. The Japanese were arrested
with him, but their whereabouts is not

It is' reported that a correspondent

allowed to Jeave on agreeing to "say
nothing about the unconfirmed; report
that fifty-one Russian sailors had been
killed in the engagement on Tuesday.
One refugee says he saw seven bodies
landed from a disabled cruiser : which
was in a bad position, with a. heavy
list, bow down.
All foreign steamships that have left
Dalny have heard nothing of the Jap

There are 200 Japanese still In Port

The steamship Chefu arrived here to

land fight between Dalny "and .Port

firmed by those who came from Port
Arthur. , v '",-.
After the attack on Port Arthur
on Tuesday, the Japanese fleet did not
return. About thirty shells struck in
town. One on Main street broke every
window. Others struck on the hills
among: . small houses, one ' killing a
woman and a child. The people - are
i anic stricken and are leaving . the
town by every train. ,
The German flagship Hansa has ar
rived here for coal. Her movements
are being watched with interest. She
left Port Arthur three weeks ago and
has since that time been cruising In the
Gulf of Pechili and along the Korean
coast. It Is also remarked that the
German steamer Chefu was given pref
erence over other vessels In leaving
Port" Arthur. Advices from Dalny,
dated Wednesday, stated that every
thing was quiet there.
RUSSIA'S BALTIC SEA
FLEET HAS BUT FOUR
UP-TO-DATE VESSELS
The report from Germany that fif
teen Russian warships have started
from . " the Baltic Sea â * for s the
Orient is apparently an exaggera
tion. There remain In the Baltic ports
only eight battleships, four armored
cruisers, seven coast defense ships and
two protected cruisers. Of the battle
ships ' the Alexander , III, Borodino,
Knlaz Souvaroff and Orel are new
ships, launched in 1901-02 and ought
to be completed by this time. TJiey
are of 13,600 tons and eighteen knots
speed. The Alexander II, the Peter
Veliki and the Sissol Veliki range
from .9927 tons to 8880 tons and are
deficient in speed and protection. The
Xavarin, of 10,200 tons, also is out of
date. . None of the four armored cruis
ers are fit to stand up against the
rough usage by Japanese ' ships, as
they are comparatively old, of small
size and slow speed.
-The coast defense ships range in
size from 3462 to 4200 tons, three be
ing built as far back as 1867-68, the'
others In 1893-94-96. They are rated
at about ten knots and' would be ut
terly useless In the open sea.
The two protected cruisers are the
Almax and the Admiral Korniloff.
The latter was built in 1887 and has
done many years' service in Asiatic
waters, necessitating her present re
construction, now in progress; and the
Almaz, Just completed, is of only 2385
tons.
Under the most favorable conditions
the Baltic relief force would not exceed
the' four new battleships referred to,
with the possibility of the Navarin be
ing added. S&PQBBH â¢ ,-.
WRIGHT CORRECTS HIS
REPORT THAT RUSSIAN
SHIPS ARE AT MANILA
.WASHINGTON, -Feb. 14.â The ad
ministration is somewhat puzzled over
the report from Governor i Wright that
there, were seven Russian warships in
Manila Bay yesterday. Secretary Taft
received a cable' message from Gov
ernor. Wright' yesterday afternoon,
which read:
"Seven Russian warships in. the har
bor. - Send instructions. Has - United
States declared neutrality?"?
Secretary Taft immediately took this
message to the White House and a
conference with the President and
Secretary Hay followed. Secretary
Hay was anxious that these warships
should get away from Manila before
their presence should generally, become
known, to prevent the 'danger of a
naval battle In the region of the Phil
ippines and possibly in waters under
the Jurisdiction of the United States.
Secretary Taft cabled the full proc
lamation of 'neutrality to- Governor
Wright and also sent Instructions to
the effect that the Russian ships could
be : allowed ; to . remain at Manila not
more than twenty-four hours.
Last night Secretary Taft received a
second message from Governor
Wright, saying: Â»
"Report of Russian warships in har
bor an error."

FIRST AUTHENTIC ACCOUNT
OF GREAT NAVAL COMBAT
How the Variag and the Korutz AVere Destroyed in Unequal
Special Cabie to The Call and' Xew York Herald: Copyright, 1904, by the New^ York Herald Publishing Company.
, NAGASAKI, Feb. 14.^- At .4:30 o'clock
p. m. February 8;: the Japanese ,war
ships Akashi, Chlgoda, Takachiho,
Naniva and Mikasa, with seven tor
pedo boats and- three' transports, en
tered Chemulpo, harbor, having â  on
board 2500 men. They began to land
troops immediately, in .- perfect order
and under a superb system, and at
dawn of February 9 all of the men were
billeted safely. The warships then
withdrew.!
At 10 o'clock the Japanese Consul
warned British residents that Admiral
Urlu,' commanding the . squadron, had
given the Russian senior ; officer, the
captain of the Variag, . and the com-;
mander of the Korutz ~ until nocm * to
leave port, failing which he would be Ti
gin action. ' *â¢*Â«â¢Â»â .
At 11 : 30 o'clock In the forenoon the
Variag and the Korutz steamed away.'
I proceeded in the steamship Ajax;
from which I. saw them met by eight
Japanese vessels. '
.The first gun was fired at 11:40. The
Japanese, scorning the Korutz, concen
trated their fife "on the ; Variag. â ; The
latter continually circled around, reply
ing from her \ sides alternately, but it
was apparent that her shooting was not
good. On every side her shells , went
wide. It was observable that the Jap
anese gradually closed, the battleship
Mikasa doing most of the firing and
damage.
At 1:15 p. m. they ceased ; firing as
the Variag re-entered the harbor and
took up a position, \ with the Korutz,
among the other warships. One of; her
boilers was injured and she -was onfire
astern. The flames were extinguished
by flooding the compartment. She re r
fused to disclose 'the 'number of -J her
casualties.
The Japanese, meanwhile, -had with
drawn again, waiting until â y\^
(Here the special cable â  was broken
off, but . it began again as follows:) ;
' Four ' o'clockâ My writing was Inter
rupted at this moment by a terrific re
port. The Korutz has been blown up
by the Russians, whose men can be
seen in boats pulling for - the Variag v
An Immense column of smoke arose*
and then cleared awayr leaving a eight
of Korutz , with ' funnel and ' mast "just
above water. ' '
The Japanese ashore are wildly cheer
ing. The Variag â¢ still remains at
anchor.
At 5:20 p. m. fire appeared in the after
part of the Variag and spread slowly.
The Japanese then stopped firing. . â¢ ,
â¢ :. The Variae heeled over, surely but
barely perceptibly, and at 6:05 she sank
with a loud rumble. .
The Russians admit the Korutz fired
the first shot, but say it was accidental,
no doubt. They> made a fine fight
against odds. .

The' Japanese did not lose a man.
A dispatch from Chemulpo gives the
following account of the destruction of
the Variag and Korutz: :>. â ^â¢jVi
The Japanese fleet, ; commanded by
Admiral Urlu on the * flagship Adzuma,
arrived at noon and sent a wireless
telegram to the Japanese cruiser Chl
goda. ' i which was lying at anchor be
tween the Variag and Korutz to join
the fleet outside. The Rursians found
themselves trapped. Admiral .Uriu
then signaled, giving, the' Russians five
minutes In which to surrender. ~ \ The
Russians ignored the demand to sur
render and the Japanese opened fire.
A ' brisk engagement, lasting two
hours, followed.- The Russia.! vessels,
getting the worst of an encounter .In
which the odds were overwhelmingly
against them, steamed back Into : the
harlÂ»or. The Variag,' which waB badly
damaged, listed heavily:. ;â  : . â¢; â  - f. â 
Two. hours later- the Russians at
tempted to i break . through â¢ the : Jap
anese fleet, which was. \encountercd
four miles from the inner harboi A
fierce fight followed. The Russian ves
sels were badly' damaged. .The Korutz
was' blown up, presumably by its own
crew, in order" to" escape ; capture.; A
portion of the crew was rescued by the
Fre-ch and Italian -essels in the: har
bor. The Variag > tried to es cape, but
sidv'enly ; an/ explosion . occurred â â  and
the Variag was seen to sink. Wheth-
er she was sunk by a Japanese r hell or
by >-er own crew Is not known.. â '.
\ The United States gur.boat sVIcks-;
burg and the British cruieer Talbot
witnessed the battle. ' "
The survivors of the Variag and the
Korutz still rremaln on board *of. the
British cruiser Talbot, the Italian
cruiser .Elba and the French cruiser
'Pascal.; "The situation is becoming
acute,- 1 as the Japanese have twice
made^ demands on the commanders of
the .ree foreign vessels that the Rus
sians ' be : surrendered as prisoners of
war.:.- The captain of the Talbot. being
the senior naval officer,' each time re
plied; that*- he. was awaiting â instruc
tions from hiajf Government. None of
the Itussians are on board the Ameri
can gunboat Vicksburg, whose * com
mander considers that the Japanese
are right in their demand, as the Rus
sian took advantage of the clemency
of 'the Japanese, returning. to the'har
bor and then taking refuge on the for
eign vessels and refusing to surrender,
whereas the Japanese fleet refrained
from sinking them; in the open sea as
it could have done. - ;
A magnificent episode of the battle
was the second sortie of the two Rus
sian cruisers. - With bands playing the
national anthem," the international
fleet loudly cheering the, bravery and
gallantry of the Russians,-: the 'Variag

fleet and certain destruction. . â¢

G(i FORTH TO TIGHT
.* SEOUL, Friday, Feb. 12.râ The fol
lowing account of the battle off : Che
niulpo, which resulted In the . loss r of
the Russian cruiser Variag and < the
gunboat Korutz, has reached here : .
During the night of February 8 the
Japanese landed 1300 men at Che
mulpo and on the morning of the 9th
three Japanese .cruisers, four gunboats
and eight torpedo boat destroyers,
under command of Admiral Urlu, ap
proached the ; harbor, . "but did nbt
enter. The Korutz and .Variag i were
lying In the harbor. The Japanese
Admiral gave" them until noon^ Ho
come out. Bo Uk Russian vessels
cleared for action. All the shipping in
the harbor was" notified by A^iral
Uriu to get out of the firing line.
There was in -the -harbor also the
British cruiser Talbot, the French
cruiser Pascal, " the Italian cruiser
Elba and the United States gunboat
Vicksburg. All â¢ were active. The
Variag signaled the Talbot and a boat
from the British cruiser went to her.
afterward the Variag and
Korutz got under- way and steamed

English warship cheered them as they
went out to fight. * ' . .
When the Russians were four, miles
out the Japanese threw a shot across
their bows, but they did not stop. The
Japanese lay between the ; Islands, ten
miles ; out, blocking , the only : entrance
to the harbor. ... ;,;, , ;
j When the Russians were six miles
from the Japanese fleet heavy firing be
gan on both 'sides. The Variag turned
her broadside loose at 11:55 a. m.. Then
the Variag turned at right angles to the
westward and steamed a short' distance
as. If to make the beach, but was seen
to suddenly turn again and give the
enemy her other broadside. The Japa
nese continued firing until, 12:22 o'clock,
when the Variag was seen to be on fire
near the stern. The Russian vessels
then turned back toward the harbor
and ceased firing at 12 : 42 â¢ p. m. The
Japanese followed almost to 'the en
trance of the'' harbor, firing on the
Variag, which had a heavy list to port
and was evidently in a sinking condi
tion. The .Korutz was practically un
touched. , â¢
The Variag lost thirty men and
seven officers killed ; : and forty-two
wounded. Count Muro was killed on
the bridge. .*; -â¢ ' >.â¢ ;
About 600 , shots were fired In .all,
but the firing was < not' very 'accurate

of her engrines. ; ,; , -v

The Korutz was abandoned at 3:30

TURN NIPPON MARU;
INTO WAR VESSEL
* MR JAPAN'S USE
Among the passengers on the steam
ship China, w hlch , arrived . yesterday
from the Orient, were' a number of of
ficers of the Japanese liners Nippon
Manx and Hongkong Maru, which were
recently taken oft the line between this
port and Yokohama and transferred to
the Japanese naval service., All the
foreign officers attached to the vessels
were relieved from service as ' soon . as
the two liners reached Japanese waters
and ' their ; places Immediately filled by
little , brown men. , Although the ;, gov
ernment has appropriated the vessels
for i its own use the former officers are
still under pay of the steamship com
pany, and a few taking advantage of
the- prospects of a prolonged war, ob
tained permission to return to this
country. (: - â / ".
. When [ the Nippon Maru ; entered the
Japanese harbor on January 24 she was
hailed by a small government -boat on
which were a Japanese admiral and a
captain, who promptly boarded . the
vessel and formally announced to the
commander ~of â¢the latter that they
were there In the name of the Japan
ese government and were prepared to
assumS charge of the vessel. Captain
Green. 'apparently having expected the
naval officials, acknowledged their
authority with the remark: "Gentle
men, she is yours." and 'as soon as* the
passengers and cargo had been remov
ed, the captain and officers of the Nip
pon and even the members of the crew.
irrespective of their nationality, with
few exceptions, left 'the vessel. The
storekeeper and the chief engineer and
his assistants, all Japanese, were re
tained, the first mentioned as the rep
resentative of the steamship company.
Hardly had the officers and men de
parted before boats bearing new of
ficers from the navy and a crew of 550
men came alongside of the Nippon and
she was soon headed for the naval yards
where arrangements had already been
made for overhauling her. The officers'
cabins were hurriedly torn out and re
placed with hammock quarters and the
work of renovating^ begun as the ves
sel started for Yokosuka for her arm
ament. .
The latter consists of a six-Inch gun
on her. bow and one at her stern and
four six-pounders, two- on each side.
It was later learned that the Nippon
Mara was to be. used for the members
of the Japanese war council, composed
of admirals and generals, who will
travel from' port to port, planning var
ious strategic movements In which the
navy and army of the Mikado will par
ticipate.
Money was not spared by the govern
ment in hurriedly converting the Nip
pon Maru into a palatial floating es
tablishment for her vrar representa
tives. The Hongkong Maru was taken
over by the government three days be
fore the Nippon Maru and was likewise
refitted with the same armament and
assigned to the â  auxiliary division - of
the fleet as a dispatch boat.
Up to tho time the China departed
from Japan, those who had been eager
ly - looking for some outward sign of
approaching war, had failed to get the
slightest information.
"It was generally understood that
war was to come." said one of the re
turning officers of the Nippon Maru
last evening, "and the Japanese on all
sides were discussing nothing else, yet
not one of them could tell you any
thing about the movements of the gov
ernment. Unlike the hurried prepara
tions for war In other countries, there
were no gathering of troops In or near
the larger settlements and you might
travel along the harbor 'front- all day
long and not detect a move on the part
of the shipping that could be regarded
as significant. All the work was being
done within the distant naval and army
stations and with the greatest secrecy.
Many experienced war correspondents,
a large number of whom were quarter
ed in the Hotel Metropole at Tokio.
agreed that they had never known of
such a successful system of news cen
soring as was then in effect. They could
do nothing but await the sound of the
booming of guns which would be their
accepted signal of the beginning of
hostilities. The censorship even ex
tended to the photograph galleries of
the different cities. In every establish
ment of this kind there was stationed
a government official, through whose
hands every film and plate, presented
for development, had to pass and If the
officer fancied that the subject of the
photograph was In any way likely to
be of service to the Russians .he
promptly signified the fact by destroy
ing the plate or film.;. .
"The feeling throughout Japan was
that the Russians were simply delaying
matters until summer, when they
hoped, by a . great military force, to
come down on the Japanese and crush
them. In fact. It was common talk hi
Yokohama and Tokio - that Russia
might at any moment yield. to the de
mands of the Japanese in order to es
tablish temporary peace and later In
the year, when conditions were more
favorable, break off all relations again
and grab everything In sight."
An Important Discovery.
Reports have come from New Zeal
and of what Is regarded aa a most Im
portant bacteriological discovery, made
by J. A. Gllruth, who Is pathologist in
the public health department of that
colony. Anthrax has appeared among
the cattle of New Zealand, asd Mr.
Gllruth, during the course of his ex
periments, discovered by chance that
an animal particularly susceptible to
the disease, like a rabbit or guinea pig.
will resist the most virulent doses of
anthrax, provided the germs are mixed
with a greater quantity, of another
species of microbe that. In itself, must
be non-pathogenic, or Incapable of pro
ducing any disease. A guinea pig or
rabbit inoculated with an Infinitesimal
dose of anthrax culture will succumb In
from twenty-four to forty-eight" hours.
but mixing the anthrax culture with a
double quantity of Innocuous ' organ-
Ism, the animal feels no 111 effects. Mr.
Gilruth has further- discovered that a
certain degree of Immunity can be con
ferred by Inoculating the. animal with
the mixed culture. â New York Com

MINISTER GRISCOM
CONFERS WITH THE
JAPANESE PREMIER
TOKIO, Saturday, Feb. 13.â
United States Minister Griscom
called upon Premier Komura last
night and an extended conference
was held, the nature of which has
not been disclosed. It is thought
it related to the effort' of 'the. powd
ers to obtain a statement of the
attitude of Japan toward' preserv
ing the entity of '. China, as has
been proposed by Secretary Hay.
The situation in the north . of .
China is exceedingly delicate.
The Japanese have legation
guards at Peking and Tientsin in
close proximity to the guards of
the Russian legation and there is
danger of a conflict. It is feared
that if the north of China â  is>.in-.
cluded in the sphere of operations
it ' will be â  impossible . to prevent
disorder and uprisings as a^ blind
for attacks on all foreigners.

YOUNG MAN
ENDS LIFE
WITH GAS
Harry Williar, a Youth Xot Yet
Out of His Teens, Decides
There Is Nothing- in This
World Worth Living For
UNBALANCED MTXD
PROBABLE CAUSE
Leaves a Letter to the Public in
Which lie Upbraids Father
and Professes Devotion to the
Many Girls That- Knew Him
Harry R. Williar, a youth still in his
teens, rented a room at the Florence
Hotel. Ellis and Powell streets, Satur
day night, wrote two letters", turned on
the fraÂ« and passed into eternal sleep.
His body, stiff and cold in death, wai
found yesterday afternoon by a Japa
nese bedmaker employed In the hotel.
He had evidently planned the suicide
deliberately, and wished to make it as
spectacular as possible by leaving a
missive behind him which would do
credit to the author of a "penny dread
ful." In it he*upbraided his father for
bringing him into the world, but spoke
in most endearing terms of his sister.
He also left a sealed letter to be opened
only by his father. 0MIHB
The young man was the son of H. R.
"Williar, who is in the paper business at
214 Pine street and was formerly lo
cated with the firm of A. Fleischacker
& Co. He was about 17 years of age,
end while he had of late been somewhat
erratic his relatives did not deem his
derangement so severe that there was
danger of ending his life. According to
his farewell message, however, the
voung man desired to revenge himself
upon the world by quitting it for using
h:rn unfairly. HHI
At the Florence Hotel the employes
professed to know nothing of Williar.
They said he engaged a room at about
S o'clock Saturday night, paying 50
cents in advance for it. He went out,
and returned about 1 o'clock Sunday
morning. On both occasions he seemed
to be in the best of health and spirits.
Yesterday afternoon when the bed
maker rapped on the door he found it
locked on the inside. As there was no
response to repeated calls he opened
the door with a pass key.
Williar's body was found, partly
dressed, lying on the bed, while gas was
pouring from an open jet from which
the tip had been removed. The keyhole
had been carefully stuffed with paper
that the deadly fumes might do their
work more quickly and with less dan
ger of detection- .
On the table was found the note,
written on paper torn from a cheap
notebook and Inscribed as follows:
4 To be read when I am dead only.
Make sjire before reading this note."
The note reads: V
"For anyone: I am going to kill
myself to-night, or else make a darned
good attempt to do so. simply because
I am of no use in this world and do
nothing but bring shame and disgrace
to all who care for me. At least so
my father says, and I guess he is
right- May God forgive me for this
crime, butl feel it is better to be dead
than to disgrace my lovely sister,
whom I love with all my heart.
"I wish to beg the proprietor of this
house's pardon for committing this
deed in his house, but I do not know
of any house like it that has gas in
the rooms, so I trust he'll forgive me.
I thought this plan all out last night
and am resolved to see it through. '
"Xo one will miss me. and the world
will be a little better when I am out
of it- I owe Hastings the sum of $9 50.
which I am sorry to say will fall to
my father to pay. Then I owe my
school S2 and Ben Jordan, personally,
12 25. which I hope will be -paid as a
last favor to a wayward son. . I am
heartsick, sore and weary, but it can
not be helped. My sister cares for me;
that is one comfort- She enjoys her
dance to-night as much as I enjoy
myself. For my father, I â¢ wish to say
that I am sure he will be happy, with
me off his hands and nothing " to
worry him. He had no right to bring
me into this world of sin and crime
If he had not* the patience to put up
with me. This is my last message,
and to all my friends, no matter who
they are, I send my love and affection
âeven to the girls at the store,
amongst who is Marie. The rest of
my friends, and I have quite a few.
especially girls. I want to say I am
sorry to do this If it brings my shame
to them
"Good-bye, all, and God bless and
keep my sister for ever and ever."

UPON AL VINZA HAYWARD
Noted Bonanza King and One of the City's Oldest Pioneer
Citizens Passes Quietly Away at the Residence of His
Friend Charles D. Lane, After, Prolonged Siege of Illness
ONE OF SAN FRANCISCO'S MOST WIDELY . KNOWN CAPITALISTS,
WHO DIED YESTERDAY AFTERNOON AFTER A LONG ILLNESS
AT THE RESIDENCE' OF CHARLES D.. LANE.
Alvinza Hayward, mining king, flnan-'
cier and one* of the best known of San
Francisco's pioneer, citizens, .passed
peacefully away at ,4:15 o'clock yester
day afternoon at the residence . of
Charles D. Lane, on Clay street.
Paralysis, extending ,to the heart and
lungs, was the immediate cause of the
aged capitalist's demise. At the bedside
when -he passed away were Charles D.
Lane and.Drs. Arnold and Hazelhurst.
No arrangements have' as yet been
made for the funeral.
Alvinza Hayward was born in the State
of Vermont In 1821. His "youth was un
eventful, and after leaving school he be
gan the study of law. When still a very
young man he left his native State and
settled down to the practice of his pro
fession In Canton, N. Y. After a time,
however, he went farther west, to Michi
gan, where he engage*! in lead mining
and the lumber business with good finan
cial results. |
The news of the discovery of gold in
California interested him greatly â  and as
soon as he could get his. Michigan .in
terests in proper shape: he started for
California, arriving here In'lS50.'
, He first engaged In placer mining, but
later, in 1S52. acquired ' half ownership of
a gold quartz mine, the Eureka, in Ama
dor County, which, under his| personal
management, made him and his part
ner very wealthy men in a few years.' He
disposed of that property to follow the
stream of wealth seekers to the fabulous
ly rich lodes of Nevada. and, associated
with John P. Jones, he operated on the
Cornstock with much success, ; until
health considerations . compelled' him to
withdraw for a time at least. from active
work. He was /then already a million
aire several times over. '
He remained inactive for about ten
years, when, the state of his health per
mitting, his restless spirit ; drove him
again into the mining regions.
He did not go " back : to - the Comstock,
but went again : to 'Amador " and El Do
rado counties, with the prestige of his
former . successes there as an assurance
for the future. He bought and operated

until fair and full winds left us on the
homeward way from Buenos Ayres,
Just above the equator." The ship
hadn't been becalmed in the trop

comes an ordinary sized shark nosing
around.
"Word was passed up forra'd and a
chunk of pork as -big as ray head ; was
baited on a hook and cast astern. The
shark took right hold and we hauled
It alongside and aboard.
"It was a 'peculiar kind of _ a shark,
that '. didn't have no teeth whatsoever,
and its tail, which had two flukes to it,
was about half as long as the body.
"Well, we cut T ,open the shark to see
if we could find any curios inside.
There were no curios nor nothing of
that soft. All there was in that shark
that we could rind was twenty-six little
sharks, so that made twenty-seven
sharks all told caught with one hook.
XThe little ones wor about six- inches
long, all alive and all wor toothless and
having white stomachs.
. "I wanted the cook to make a shark
stew, for young shark is tender and
good eatln', but the other hands
wouldn't listen" to It, so we : threw 'em
all overboard, and the cook put another

After this he formed a partnership with

Before members;. 'of the Delaware

phla exchange. Professor E. G. â¢ Conk
lin recently gave lively demonstrations
of how a starfish eatsan : oyster.
Professor Cohklin exhibited about a
dozen starfish, each engaged in differ
ent stages of the process of opening
and eating oysters. The process, he
said,' consumes from twelve to fifteen
hours. As the starfish cannot get the
oyster into its mouth, it practically
turns its stomach ; inside out and ; into
the oyster shell." As i the. oyster, is thus
digested outside the body of the.star
fish, the Juices are sucked up Into the
starfish's body. The starfish, Professor
Conklin said, is the most "destructive

How to Educate the Boy.
Not . a few fathers hurt their sons
and; damage the careers of those sons
by picking out careers for them. Train
up the boy in the way he should go-,
and then let him choose his own work!
In ; the choice of a' vocation, as in the
choice of a wife, every young man
should be left ; alone.' If he ''is not
worthy of being left alone the parent
has' grievously injured the boy in ', the
preceding.decade of his life. These in
terpretations mean that I would hot
educate my. boy under a private tutor.
I would educate my * boy with boys,
although not entirely by boys. Boys
do> however, educate boys;' but a boy
who is trained alone is liable .to fail
in adjusting himself to his member-,
ship in humanity.'; He is to become
a brother of trie tommon lot. He there-'
fore - should hpw to "adjust
himself .to his fellows. Neither would
I educate my son 'abroad; he "Is an
American boy. I 'shjbuld be glad to
have him get; all that. is best from the
private school in Lausanne or Geneva,
but not for one Instant would I have
his ideas formed by the French masttr
or his methods by the German. A'pri

Loyal to the Mikado.
It is tolerably certain that but ; for
the veneration in which the Emperor
Is held Japan would long ago have been
at war with Russia, or there would
have been a . revolution - in the country.
Happily, the intense patriotism fof the
people is kept . in check by a rever
ence for the ' ruling sovereign which it
is scarcely possible for the Western
mind to understand. The Japanese peo
ple, as GÂ«orge Lynch pointed out the
other day, are hot religious In a con
ventional sense. Their religion takes
the form of a childlike belief in the
"son of heaven." If the Mikado were
to issue a decree to-morrow : that all
the Russian demands should be con
ceded, the â  nation â  would acquiesce,
though many, would commit- suicide,
just as happened when Japan was rob

What Doctors Make.
There are about 200,000 doctors in the

public In the country- pays $150,000,000
annually; for, medical ] attendance, omit
ting entirely the -money spent for pat

Burns and Secure Confession
SWEETHEART OF YOUTH
I LEADS TO DETECTION
Prisoner Admits That He Has
Been Responsible for Recent
Hold-Ups and Implicates a
Companion in the Offenses
Special Disratch to ThÂ«.CaIl.
SPOKANE. Wash., Feb. 14.â :Whlle
the preliminary examination . of Free
man and Norman James, the â¢ wellr
known society youths of Spokane, is
bu^t half finished and was to be con
tinued Monday, the real robber was
captured at an* early hour this morn-'
ing. His confession of ten recent hold
ups, including the ones for which the
James boys were being tried, com
pletely exonerates . the lads' of - the
charges against them/ â¢ There was
great, rejoicing in the James, home to
night .when' the -news became known
and there is much comment all over
the city over the dime novel-like work
of the city detectives . which resulted
in the capture of the real thug.
Leroy Burns is the man who admits
all the recent crimes. He is 26 years
of age. . He has used many aliases
and his mother, Mrs. Rampo, is said
to live at Whatcom, Wash. After the
arrest of Freeman James on a charge
of holding up W. W. Kay. east of this
city, the fact was printed that the al
leged robber rode a sorrel horse. A
local liveryman read this statement
and notified the^police of furnishing
Leroy Burns with a sorrel horse on
the day of the hold-up. This clew
was taken up,- but the officers got the
wrong scent and lost three days trac
ing a wrong Burns to Seattle. * Again
the work began. Three detectives
were put on the case, one learned of
; Burns having a sweetheart living east
of Spokane. She was shadowed with
out avail until it was learned she. was
coming to a dance in Spokane Satur
! day night. At the dance nothing hap
pened until midnight, when she was
given a note by a messenger. She an
swered the note and the detectives fol
lowed the messenger to a room in the
Alki House. When Burns answered
the officers' knock at the door he rec
ognized the detectives and said:
"Oh. it's all ofT. rra glad you came.
I'll tell you all about it."
A full confession was given in, the
presence of the prosecuting attorney
and Burns implicated William Hoff
man, who has also been : placed . under,
arrest. Burns says he was" hard up â¢
when he began the j holding-up work.
He says he, felt; sorry. when he noted
by the. papers that the James -.boys
were charged with the crime ,he com
mitted. ': His , ' series of hold-ups Â£ re^
suited in small returns; in each case.
He. clears up the mystery of
highway robberies that "have occurred
lately. The girl in the case does not
yet know.' that she was the innocent
cause of her lover's undoing.

A Royal Book Lover.
Empress Catherine II of Russia was,
a ' great reader ' and a lover of books.
One of her services to letters in. Rus
sia* was the purchase of the libraries
of Voltaire and Diderot She was a
warm friend and admirer of these
French philosophers and their work
interested her, because she was eager
to learn new theories of politics and
government. Voltaire's library of
about 7000 volumes is now a part of
the Russian imperial library in v the
Hermitage Palace and in the hall â  de
voted to it .'is Houdon's statue of Vol
taire. The ; story ot Catherine's purr
chase of. Diderot's library Is Interest
ing. It is creditable to ier tact and
her generosity. Diderot named Â£15,'
000 as the price' of his library. Cath
erine II offered him Â£16,000. and
named as a condition of the bargain
that her purchase should remain with
Diderot until his death. Thus Diderot,
without leaving Paris, became Cath
erine's librarian In his own library.
As her librarian he was given a yearly
salary of Â£1000. One year this salary
vras paid. 'Then Catherine wrote v to
her librarian that she could not have
him or her library suffer through the
negligence of a ; treasurer's' clerk and
that she had set aside for the care and
Increase of her library. for' fifty. years.
At the end of that period she â - would
make new arrangements. A check for
$25,000 accompanied ' this letter. â â

Men v at City of Washington
- WASHINGTON, Feb.. 15, 3:45 a. m.
Senator Hanna has liad another sink-
Ins si>eU. Dr. Osier was called from
his bed and h'e and DrV Carter worked
laboriously over : tho patient. As are
suit there - has been a : complete -\ re
action, although the Senator has been
left much weaker. Dr. Osier returned
to his bed. with instructions to ';â  be
caUed should another spell be immi
nent. tMBBHSfSUKmSfM
WASHINGTON, Feb. 14.â This 'was
regarded throughout as. the crucial 'day
In Senator Hanna' s â  battle . for. llfe. ! ; It
began with assurances of quite an opti
mistlft character. \: The first news from
the sick room was announced shortly
after 1 7 o f clock a. m. The Senator, the*
doctors ' said, had passed a perfectly!
quiet night. His temperature?- was
103.8, pulse 120 and stronger -JmA; his
respiration was declared to be satisfac
tory, although ho figure :was given.;.
At intervals of two hours :durihg;the
night Senator Hanna- had been aroused
and given nourishment,': after which he
immediately would ': resume his sleep.
The doctors supplemented v .the., an
nouncement . the statement that
the condition of- the ', Senator \ at -those
times surpassed all their expectations.
, This statement had'hardly been is
sued when an unexpected change for
the worse took place. Dr. ; Osier had
gone to Mr. Hanha's room and Dr.'Car
ter and Secretary, Dover had ; stepped
down to the dining-room for breakfast.
Dr. Rlxey had not arrived, and the Sen
ator was alone with his nurses. Sud
denly he became noticeably weaker.
His rapid breathing excited alarm; and
other evident signs of distress caused a
hurried summons for both physicians.
On their almost instant arrival his
pulse was beating at the alarming'rate
of 137 and his respiration was above 40.
The oxygen apparatus was immediate
ly put into use, the breathing cone was
placed over the Senator's mouth and
nostrils and 'relief secured.
, DOUBT AMONG DOCTORS.
- At 9:30 o'clock an official bulletin was
issued covering this , period. The phy
sicians declined to make further, com
ment on the outlook, but it was noticed
that their optimism of the early morn
ing had been entirely dissipated by the
8 o'clock â¢ sinking^ spell:";* However, for
the â¢ neit- few " hours the i reports which
came officially from the bedside of the
Senator all told â¢ of 'his- wonderful re
cuperative powers. , . ...
â¢ At 10:30 a. m. Dr. Osier declared Sen
ator Hanna to be entirely recovered
from the depression of the early. morn-
Ing hours. At this time â  the doctor left
for Baltimore, _with the . understanding
that he would return at 4:30 in the aft
ernoon. Drs. Rlxey, : Carter and:Ful
cher remained in constant attendance*
At noon an official bulletin was issued
showing a drop of nearly, two degrees in
the Senator's temperature, which was
looked, on as . a^ most : encouraging sign,
especially In view of the fact that the
bath had not been resorted to* to re
duce the fever. H. M. Hanna, the Sen
ator's brother, on coming: from' the sick
room Just as the. noon bulletin was is
sued, said that a very decided improve-;
ment â  in every respect had itaken | place
during the half hour immediately pre
ceding. * ;
A , lapse of , nearly, two hours then . in
tervened .without news, wh^n suddenly,
at 2 o'clock, Mr. Dick of Ohio and Mr.
Dover came from the Senator's : apart-,
ments with the announcement' that the
Senator had suffered another severe 1
sinking spell and had failed .utterly: to
respond to all stimulants administered^

This news came like a bolt â  from a
clear sky. The hotel corridors had been
thronged throughout the day with
anxious Inquirers as to the â¢ Senator's
condition. The latest news from the
sick room caused a. hush : throughout
the lobbies. â¢ Medill McCormick, â  the
Senator's son-in-law, Â« was dispatched
in haste for more powerful stimulants.
These came, but the next report, a few
minutes later, said that the doctors de
clared the end to* be only a question of
perhaps 'minutes,', but at most of hours.
â  Then, within a : space ; of three min
utes, the patient rallied; his conscious
ness returned, and by the* exertion of
his wonderful will power Senator Han
na seemed to pull himself together In
what the doctors and those at .the bed
side regarded as a most miraculous
manner. But the fight was : by no
means won. Although the afternoon
relapse had- been- railed from, it had
left a badly weakened frame for future
battles. â¢ The restoratives were contin-.
ued and the Senator would doze again
into a stupor. â  Â£\ S> o '-'< /- â  -^^;- '.&
When the- situation looked most
critical this ' afternoon" the members of
t:.e family were assembled v In the
sickroom. Mrs. Hanna' was, in almost
constant â  attendance j at . the â¢ bedside:
Others Â«n the room w^re the daugh
ters, Ruth- and;, Mabel:", respectively,
Mrs. Medill McCormick and Mrs.
Harry AT Parsons,: â¢ with ; their hus-;
bands; the Senator's son, Dan R.
Hanna and his wife : ';â  H. M. Hanna;
tKe Senator's brother, and 1-; Miss
Phelps, a niece. * After the .Senator
had made his wonderful and unex
pected rally the ladies, with the ex
ception of Mrs. Hanna. "went out. at
the suggestion of 'the physicians for

Dyspepsia destroys all. the agreeable

MAKE PEACE WITH
YOUR STOMACH
You Arc "Certain to Ix>sc If You At-
tempt the Use of Force or Violence.
You cannot force your stomach to do
work that It is unable and unwilling to
do. It has been tried 'time and again,
always with the. same result. The stom-
ach is a good and faithful servant y but
when pushed beyond the limiit It re-
bels. Some stomachs will stand much
more abuse than others, but every stom-
ach has its limit, and when that limit
is reached it;is ; a very dangerous and
unwise proceeding ' to . attempt to force
it into doing further work. The sensi-
ble and reasonable course is to employ
a substitute . to carry on the work of
digestion and give the stomach an op-
portunity to recuperate and regain its
lost strength.
/Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets, are the
only perfect substitute to take up and
carry on the work of .tired, worn-out
stomachs. They \are natural and easy
In . their work and cause no disturbance
in the digestive organs. They contain
all the essential elements that make
up tho gastric juice and other digestive
fluids ! and ' will' digest any food that a
strong, healthy stomacn will and do ,it
in the same time and in the same way.
They work independently of surround-
ing conditions, and the . fact mat the
stomach is weak or diseased does â  not
influence them at all in their useful and
effective work. â¢ They will digest food
Just as' well in a glass jar or bottle as
they will in a stomach. You can see
that for yourself by. putting one of
them into a Jar with a square meal and
some water to enable it to work.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets, by thus
relieving the stomach of its work, en-
able that organ to rest and recuperate
and regain its health and strength. The
process is perfectly natural and plain.
Nature will heal the. stomach just as
she heals a wound or a broken limb, if
she is not Interfered with, and is per-
mitted to do her work In her own
way. All interference is prevented by
Stuart's Dyspepsia TaMets. '
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are for
sale by druggists everywhere . at . 50
cents a box, and if you are afflicted with
dyspepsia, one box will make you feel
fifty times better. You will forget you
have a stomach and rejoice in the for-
getfulness. No druggist would be so
shortsighted as to try to get along with-
out .Stuart's Dyspepsia , Tablets, for
â¢they are . so popular and . are so â¢well
known for the good they have done and
the happiness they have caused that any
druggist caught without them would
lose the confidence of his customers and
be regarded as below the standard. His
business would suffer as a result and
his patrons would go to other stores
and miy their other drugs there as well
as their Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets. ;
DO NOT WEAR A LONG FACE
It is a Great Handicap In All Business
' and Social Relations.
The ' man who looks as if he had lost
his last friend is in no danger of being
crushed by the jam or the new ones
unless ho "cheers up." People are not
going out of their way nowadays tÂ» as-
sociate with i the man - of mournful and
melancholy appearance. They are afraid
fie will tell them his troubles and they
steer clear of him. as they all. have
plenty of their own.
- The most universal cause of the for-
lorn and hopeless appearance to-day is
dyspepsia. It unfits a man for every
duty of life and causes him to become
despondent and gloomy. . and necessarily
his looks xlo not belie his feelings. He
appears cast down and eejected and be-
comes*' a burden to himself and human-
ity in general. . . '
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets; are the
dyspeptic's certain ' relief. They do the
work that the stomach :s unable to do
and by relieving, that organ of Its bur-
dens permit it to regain its. health and
strength and again become active and
useful in- its -functions. They contain
all the essential ingredients that enter
into the digestive flutes and secretions
of the stomach and they actually take
up the work and. do it just as a healthy,
sound stomach would."
- By this means a man can Â» go right
ahead with his work and eat 'enough to
keep - him in proper . working \ condition.
His system is net deprived of Its neces-
sary nourishment as fl is in the â  case
of k a "starvation" cure or the employ-
ment of some of the Rrst-class chicken-
foods â¢ now on the market. Starvation,
even if it t were a good â¢ thing, could not
bo continued long enough to effect a
cure, -for a. disordered and worn-out
stomach - is not going , to become strong
and healthy in two or three days.
â¢ Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets act nat-
urally because they â¢ contain natural dl-
gestives. The principal component parts
are aseptic pepsin, malt diastase and
other ingredients with like properties
that d<y the work regardless of the con-
dition of the stomach. There Is no un-
natural or violent disturbance of the
digestive organs as the result of their
action. In fact, the existence of the
stomach is entirely forgotten as soon as
they have had time to begin their opera-
tions. They also possess very curative
and healing properties and assist tha
stomach in getting well, while relieving
it of its work. They perform tho duties
of both nurse and physician.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets asÂ© for sale
by all druggists at SO cents a box. and
there is very little danger of any drug-
glst'trying to sell you something else in
their place that is "just as good." They
are so well established and have done so
much good in the world that their namÂ«
has become a household word; so ; the
usual warning. "Accept no substitute.'!
is unnecessary in the case of Stuart's
Dyspepsia Tablets.

IS YOUR STOMACH
ON A STRIKE?
There Is Xqthlnc to Prevent Yon Era-
ploying a Substitute to
' There is such a thing * as forbearance
ceasing to be a virtue. even in the casa
of one's stomach. There is no question
but that some stomachs will stand a
great deal more wear and tear and abuse
than others, but they all have their limit,
and when that limit is reached the stom-
ach must be reckoned with as sure as
fate. The best way and really the only
effective way to treat your stomach w ner Â»
it rebels is to employ a substitute tb do
its work. This will give the weakened
and worn-out organ* an opportunity to
rest and regain its strength and health.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets relieve tha
stomach â  of its work by taking up- tha
work and doing It just as one set or
shift of workmen relieves another. They

FIRE ORDINANCE
FOR THEATERS
New Measure Which Embodies
Many Stringent Provisions
Is Heady for the Council
HOSEMEN TO BE OX HAND
Two Trained flame Fighters
Will .Attend Every Per
formance of All Playhouses
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
- HIS Broadway, Feb. 14.
â¢ The new theater ordinance, which
has been under course of preparation
for some time by Fire Chief Ball and
City Engineer McElroy, is complete
and will be presented to the City
Council to-morrow night. ,
The proposed measure makes it in
cumbent on owners, managers and
lessees of theaters, opera-houses 'or
places where public entertainments
are given, to abide by a number of
new and stringent provisions. In- the
first place a lire wall, to-be composed
of either t brick or steel, must.be con
structed so as to separate the proscen
ium from the auditorium. This wall,
in conjunction with the fireproof cur
tain, will cut the stage oft" completely
from the auditorium in case of lire.
On the stage the paint shops and, the
repair shops where combustile ma
terial is kept must be separated from
the rest of the theater by firewalls.
At each performance in the theater
two firemen belonging to the city de
partment must be on hand to uf*e the
fire apparatus in event of fire. In the
matter of broad exits, electrical wiring
and the maintenance of adequate fire
appartaus the new ordinance is very,
stringent. Before the City Treasurer
is allowed to issue a permit to any
theater to run the applicant for a li
cense must show a certificate of ap
proval to be made out by the Fire
Warden, whose duty it will be to make
inspections at stated intervals of not
less than every two weeks.
Another ordinance will be intro
duced also, making it a misdemeanor
for any person or firm to maintain a
smokestack in the residence districts
which shall be less than ten feet
higher than the tallest house in a
radius of 100 feet.-
HOODOO CLINGS
TO MACADAMS
Young Sailor Is Picked Up
for a Second
Time in Twenty-Four Hours
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
HIS Broadway, Feb. 14.
Douglas MacAdams, the 18-year-old
sailor, who "tells a remarkable tale of
adventure* in the Far Eastâ of being
shipwrecked and. of being taken for a
Russian epy and all but shot in a Jap
anese prison, was picked up in an un
conscious state for the second time in
twenty-four hours in Alameda this
morning. When he left the Receiving
Hospital in Oakland last night he said
that he was going in search of Captain
Richards," who commands a sailing ves
sel^ He evidently did nc-t reach his des
tination, but fell on the streets. He
was taken to the Alameda Sanitorium,
where he regained consciousness.
The reason assigned for his unusual
malady is that when he was taken for
a spy by the Japanese he was stoned
and had the top of his head Virtually
caved in. A bungling operation left him
with .two holes in his head, considerably
larger than hen's eggs. A thin cover
ing of Ecalp is all that protects his
brain from harm. When he lies down
his brain protrudes through these aper
tures. Medical men believe that in
time the skull may grow together
again, as he is very young.
Young MacAdams, whose home is In
Ballard. Washington, has vouchers for
the story he tells in the way of pass
ports and credentials from the United
States authorities who assisted him to
return to America. This is the story
the young man told on recovering con
sciousness In the sanitarium:
Two years ago I shipped on the Xova Bcotia
sealer Wyneric. We cruised about In northern
waters for a few months and finally drifted
near ihÂ» coast of Siberia. We were wrecked
near a place known as Osohoff. Every one on
board, except Mrf. Thomas, the captain's
wife, a sailor and myself, were drowned. From
Osohoff I worked my way . to Vladivostok.
From there I went to Japan and entered the
revenue service. I had the rank of a second
lieutenant and drew about $2O a * month. ." I
worked in the revenue service for seven
months. I then wanted, to start for America
and attempted to walk overland throurh Ja
pan. When I arrived at Hakata, where a fort
was In the process of erection, I waa taken' for
a Russian soy. I had the RuÂ«KJah passports
on roe that I had gotten at Vladivostok. There
was no one there who could talk English and
I bad to depend on the email amount of Ja
panese that I had picked : up to defend myself.
I attempted to communicate with the American
Consul at Kobe and the American Embarsador
at Toklo. They would not let me do either.' I
was stntenced to be shot. The Judge of the
court-martial sat on a stool like a tailor when
he pronounced the (sentence. He said that hÂ«
was t<ot froing to take any chances of Russia
getting any information. The day before I
wu to be shot a Japanese who had been in
America called to pee me. I explained, to him
my troubles. He got me In communication
with Erob&Esador Grissom. who secured my
release and passage en the Logan for America,
which arrived ye*terday.
When I was arrested as a spy the populace
stoned me, breaking my sfcull open. Since
then I have been subject to these epileptic at
tacks.
The youthful adventurer says he was
robbed of $90 last night He was then
on his way home to his parents in
Washington. He went to see Captain
Richards, in Alameda, to get funds. In
quiries show that the captain is now at
sea.

DISTINGUISHED BOTANIST
PLANS FOR EXPERIMENTS
Professor Hugo de Vries of Amsterdam, Holland, Forwards
Flowers to University With Which He Will Demon
strate Theory That All Life Is Undergoing Evolution
BERKELEY, Feb^J4.^Intfantlclpa>
tlon of his coming to demonstrate his
theories the origin of the
species at the next summer session of
the University of California, Professor
Hugo de Vries of the University of
Amsterdam, Holland, has sent to Pro
fessor W. J. V. Osterhout of the botany
department of the university varieties
of. the evening primrose with which he
will carry on his experiments. These
seeds will be, planted immediately so
that they will be In bloom by the time
the great botanist arrives in California
In June.
By means of the evening primrose
Professor de Vries has provided sup-:
plementary proofs of Darwin's theory
of evolution. The opponents, of that
theory have repeatedly declared their
dissatisfaction with .it on the ground
that it does not reveal that all life is
undergoing a process of evolution â that
Is, so that It can be seen. So In order
to establish the fact that evolution is
going on and may be -recognized. Pro
fessor de Vries experimented with the
primrose and obtained such results as
even to convince the skeptics; of his sue-'
cess. KPV
Professor de Vries hit upon, the prim
rose as the subject for his demonstra
tions purely by accident. He tried a
great number of plants before finally
discovering that the primrose was In a
condition of mutationâ that is, in that
state of its life where it is evolving new
species. This condition in plant' life is
one of the Inexplicable things in nature,
something too puzzling for /the scien
tists even to guess at. In the primrose
the mutation is shown in a number of
waysâ in the increasing number of the
seeds, the changes in the leaves and
flowers. Of course, these changes might
have been attained by artificial means.
WATER COMPANY
WANTS A RAISE
Contra Costa Corporation Is

52,500.000. Of this amount approxi
mately. $1,000,000 will be devoted to" the
purchase of school sites and the-erec

mainder of the proposed bond issue
is apportioned with a , view to erecting
a new City Hall, improving the boule
vard around . Lake . Merrltt and pur;
chasing various parks to be used as

AGRICULTURAL
MEN DISAGREE
Secretary James Wilson arid
Professor. E: W. Hilgard Dis
pute Over Vital Question
MAKE COUNTER' CHARGES
Soil Analyses and the Work
of Colleges â¢Precipitate Con
troversy in the Newspapers
Berkeley, Office San Francisco Call,
.'2148 Center Street, Feb. 14.
James Wilson, Secretary of the De
partment of Agriculture â  at Washing
ton, "says the. agricultural colleges of
the ;United; States 'do not;turn"out men
useful to agricultural science, and
that nothing had been known about
the chemical : analysis of the soils until
he went to "Washington. Professor, E.
-W., Hilgard, dean of 'the Agricultural
College ; at the" University of California
and director of the agricultural experi
ment station,' asks. How does Secretary
.Wilson â ; know .all these things t when -he
does not .pretend' to be a scientific ex
pert or;know anything, about' the'his
tory of agriculture?-
This between two men
to whom the farmers of the country
look i for' a 'good; deal was precipitated
by ; some " broad statements that ; Secre
tary Wilson made", before .a Congres
sional ; investigating . committee" , last
month in Washington.. But-the fire of
dispute had :been smoldering r long be
rore' that, and ; It needed .only one' thing
to. bring matters to the' point where the
discontented began" to .wrangle. It
seems that Secretary AVilson had in
vited criticism; by. commenting adverse
ly, on the. work of the-agricultural-sta
tions whenever, he made a public ad
dressâcomments that were not. likely
to please the' men in'charge of them.
HILGARD MAKES REPLY.
In one of these addresses at Rochester
Secretary. Wilson is ' credited with say-
Ing: ; "When r I went to Washington I
found that we had no knowledge of
soils,' and I went to work and organized
a , bureau of soils, and' I have over 200
scientists engaged in this work."
To this. manifest dig at. the agricul
tural colleges Professor Hilgard replied
through the medium of Science that
Secretary Wilson "does not pretend to
by a scientific expert, and we must pre
sume that, his ideas oh scientific work
are mainly the result of his environ
ment. It therefore becomes an interest
ing question .whence has come to him
the Information that the agricultural
colleges have'done nothing in the direc
tion of collecting soil data. He has ex
pressed similar sentiments elsewhere,
and has been especially critical of the
colleges because, as alleged, they fail
to train students: in such a way as to
make them useful to agriculture."
Professor Hilgard then, goes on to
show that there is considerable data
on soils at .Washington that Secretary
-Wilson evidently knew nothing about.
For instance, the reports of. more than
200 soil analyses from Kentucky > and
Ohio t: were filed in ; : Washington,.; fifty
years ago.. Professor Hilgard himself
furnished data on the soils of Missis
sippi, nearly that long ago. In 1892 the
department published a. paper by him,
describing 779 varieties of soils. He
ventures' to say that there . are 1500
analyses in Washington at this mo
ment. Vfpl
.Now, after all these years of scien
tific investigation and volumes of
proof;. Secretary Wilson insists that
there is no such thinr as an agricul
tural 1 chemist in existence. This ground
he took . before the recent Congres
sional committee, .where the Is reported
CALIiS IT NEW SCIENCE.
.-. "We've hardly an agricultural chem
ist In the world. It is a new science.
The scientists "of the past have never
proved anything, at all."
Even Professor ' Hilgard is ignored
and the dialogue in th- committee,
when Secretary Wilson was testifying,
indicates the estimation In which he is
held 'by the* non-scientific .Secretary.
.They even pot his name "Hilder" ' in
stead of Hilgard. .
"There. was nn article in the papers
by a man named Hilder of- California,
who attacks your methods of investi
gation," said Congressman Graff.
. "Yes," replied. Secretary Wilson,
"he's a fine old-fashioned chemist."
The recent controversy .over soils
that was precipitated by the- sweeping
statements of Milton Whitney, chief
of^the Bureau of Soils of the Depart
ment of/Agriculture, figured somewhat
In the investigation. Whitney was
bold enough to. say In. a bulletin that

Agriculturists all over the. country

them was Professor Hilgard, to â  whose

on the ground that he is -a valuable

"that we can afford to have them go

M'KOWEN GOES

Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
HIS Broadway, Feb. 14.
The doors of the penitentiary at
Saii Quentin closed this morning on
W. A. McKowen, the late . secretary
of the Board of Regents of the Uni
versity of Cqjlfornia, who confessed
to having- embezzled more than $50,000
of that institution's funds. Under
Sheriff Hanifin escorted him to the
prison. At the request of the default
ing secretary, he was not handcuffed.
Contrary to what McKowen's
friends had hoped for, the genteel con
vict will not be given a clerical posl
tion^to while away the four years and
nine months he. will have to stay there
in actual time. - Warden Tompkins re
cently, made an order that no .new
convict would be allowed to fill a cler
ical position until he had first shown
himself deserving of that favor by
working In the jute mills. No doubt
in time McKowen will be given a more
congenial employment.
After the sentence had been passed
on the former secretary, on Frlday
last by Judge Hall, the prisoner ex
pressed some surprise at its mildness.
He said to one of the jailers that he
had expected receiving not less than
eight years. His sentence was only
six years and, eleven months.

FINE PROPERTY
ON THE MARKET
Three Thousand Acres of the
Dougherty Ranch Near Pleas
anton Are Offered for Sale
REALTY SALES ARE BRISK
Heirs of Late John W. Mackay
Transfer Block on Eighth
Street to James L. Flood
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
HIS Broadway, Feb. 14.
Three thousand acres of the big
Dougherty ranch, which la located
about three miles from Pleasanton on
the proposed line of the Western Pa
cific Railroad, have Just been placed
on the market by a San Francisco
real estate firm, and the tract will be
cut up in lots to suit the purchaser.
This ranch la the largest tract in Ala
meda County and has never been di
vided before.
Conditions In the local realty market
show little advance so far over the
first of the year, but this is partly ac
counted for by the unusually heavy
business done In real estate during the
holidays. There was almost no holi
day depression and the market has
been given little chance to show any
change. All the larger firms report
business good for this season and all
are confident that the present year will
be better than last.
H. B. Belden of the Belden Company
has recently returned to this city after
a long absence and he expresses him
self a3 very well satisfied with the
present condition of the market. Mr.
Belden said:
As I have just returned to Oakland I am
not prepared to speak authoritatively upon tho
conditions ot the market Just yet: in fact I
have hardly got Into the swing of business,
but so far as I know everything points to a
flrÂ»t-c!asÂ» year. BusineÂ«Â» Is good for so early
In the spring and I see no reason why it
should not continue so.
One of the most important trans
actions in local real estate during the
present month was the transfer, by
the heirs of the late John W. Mackay,
of half of the fine residence block on
Eighth street, between Grove and
Castro, to James L. Flood. The con
sideration named in the deed is merely
nominal; but, as nearly the entire
block is taken up .with handsome resi
dences,-the'property is valued at sev
eral hundred thousand dollars. The
conveyance was signed by Mary Louise
Mackay. Clarence H. Mackay and
Catherine Mackay. The deed states
that the signers have transferred to
James L. Flood all the property
own"d by them in Alameda County.
Conditions in the Berkeley real
estate market are about the same a*
in this city. Mr. Swain of the firm of
Moran & Swain, said:
We have n*ver before had so great demands
for property of all descriptions In Berkeley.
Our greatest difficulty lie* in getting property
for sale. Modern homes, large and small, are
In great demand. Vacant property has risen
In value about 25 per cent during the past
year and the upward tendency la very strong.
Efforts to exchange outside pro|>erty for
Berkeley property are numerous, but unavail
ing to the outsider. It certainly seems that
Berkeley's superiority as a dwelling place has
been established beyond question and people
from the Interior as well as from the metrop
olis and the East are endeavoring to locate
here. Some of our clients in Berkeley who
are forced by circumstances to sell art get
ting top price* for their property, but the
prospects for the future Indicate that the buy
ers are making prorttaMe Investments.

SECRETARY M'MAHILL WRITES OF NEEDS OF SAN JOSE
GENERAL C. A. WOODRUFF
DISCERNS PROMISING FIELD
Time Arrives for Taking
... WK.
Commerce.
SomeMatenalBetterments
By BRIGADIER GENERAL C.' At
WOODRUFF.
Now, when the minds of over eight
hundred millions of people are
centered upon the Orient and the im
portant happenings occurring or ex
pected there, seems a proper moment
to invite tho attention of your readers
to thÂ«Â» Importance to San Francisco and
the Pacific Coast in general of estab
lishing close business relations with
China and adjacent territory.
We are in the Orient and are there
to stay; we could not leave with honor
if we would and I think the majority
of our people would not if we could.
As the future of San Francisco, if it
is to become one of the world's great
commercial cities, depends largely upon
securing Its share of the trade of the
Orient, now. at the opening of a new
era in China, is the time to secure this
trade.
The construction of the four thou
sand miles of practically assured rail
roads in China and many others that
arÂ« projected will cause vast expendi
tures of money for labor, food and ma
terials and from this will naturally fol
low the development of new industries.
Higher wages and a higher standard
of living will prevail, all resulting in
increased expenditures in other walks
of life.
Great Britain, Germany, France and
Japan are exerting themselves to the
uttermost to secure this trade. We
are. individually or collectively, doing
almost nothing to bring It to our doors.
ThÂ«* conservatism of the Chinese has
a tendency to keep them in the business
ruts oncÂ«? entered into; therefore, now,
at the commencement of this new era
and before the canal is constructed, is
the time to create ruts that lead to the
Pacific Coast: now is the time for or
ganized, combined, intelligent, well?
directed efforts to achieve constantly
increasing results which, once estab
lished, will endure for generations. Cul
tivated, as is this inviting field, by rep
resentatives of other nations, we can
nct expect to reap the share of these
benefits that by risht of location, polit
ical conditions and natural advantages
belong to us unless we exert ourselves
to secure them.
GREAT GROWING MARKET.
In forty years Japan's annual imports
have increased from SI per capita to $7;
to-day China's annual imports arÂ«
about 46 cents per capita. An increase
in China of one-half that which fol
lowed Japan's awakening would mean
imports amounting to $1,400,000.
000 per annum. To enable San
Francisco to secure her full share
of this immense trade, intelli
gent, active work on the part of tho=Â»e
interested and hearty co-operation be
tween producers, manufacturers, mer
chants and transportation companies
will be necessary. This is not the time
for "the sllurian," "the fossil" or "the
knocker."
We have long looked upon the set
ting sun closing 'our Golden Gate; we
should, in a business way, represent it
as a rising sun opening that gate to a
commerce that should reach to the
farthest boundaries of China and even
to India and Siberia, which would en
able us to dispose of, in what should
become the world's greatest market,
our constantly increasing surplus pro
duce and manufactures.
Great Britain, Germany and France
send out commissions at great expense,
psrt of which is borne by the Govern
ments and part by the commercial
bodies, to report upon the conditions
â¢ and needs of these people, to find out
what they want and how best to meet
those wants. We have been contented
to "hold the sack." hoping the lighted
candle may induce some bewildered
li:rds to â¦â nt^-r. PKPi
Our principal exports to the Orient
have been flour, kerosene, cloths and
timber and that trade has come to us
because a few individuals have invaded
this field and pushed their goods, at
grreat expense, in the face of opposition
from our national competitors. To-day
we send to China goods amounting tJ
about $15,000,000 per annum, or 8 per cent
of her total imports, and receive from
China about $26,000,000, or 10 per cent
of her total exports. Take our great
vine industry for example. We supply
less than C per cent of the wine that
enters China.
WORDS OF OBSERVERS.
To show that I am not an alarmist
and that other observers agree with
me. let me auote:
Mr. Grosvenor of the British legation
at Peking in a report upon trade con
ditions said: "Englishmen should
watch carefully the development of
events, remembering that the great re
wards of enterprise will be to those who
arc flcst in the field."
Consul General Goodnow said: "I
need not impress it upon you that
Americans must now push more strong
ly than ever for the trade of China. You
have seen the situation, its possibilities
and dangers. If the trade goes Into
other hands now- it is lost to us for
many years to come. .
"An exposition here will Increase
the variety of our trade, which Is now
largely in a few great staples only.
Many of our important manufactures
are unrepresented here. You cannot
buy an American hat in Shanghai. I
know of only one store where Ameri
can shoes are cold, and it has very
few for ladies. Collars, stockings, ties
and like articles of gentlemen's wear-
Ing apnarol of American make are
not found in Shanghai. House fur
niture is very costly, and nÂ«ne comes
from America. American underwear
cannot be bought here, except the
coarsest kind. The American ma^a-
BRIGADIER GENERAL C. A. WOODRUFF. WHO GIVES PRACTICAL
ADVICE TO BENEFIT 'SAN FRANCISCO BY POINTING "OUT WHAT
MAY BE DONE TO ADD TO FOREIGN COMMERCE.
/
zines are not for sale and do not come'
here, unless ordered from home. Prac
tically all the books are of English
print and are very expensive.
"A paper-bound book which can be
bought at home for from 10 cents to
25 cents osts $1 50, Mexican; or 72
cents gvld. I asked a member of one
of ' the book firms why he r did not
brinK in some of the cheap American
books. He answered: 'We are a
British firm and prefer, to handle
British goode.' On the other hand, an
agent of an American manufacturer
said to me: '1 would as quickly put
my poods into the hands of a German,
Englishman or any other foreigner
as into the hands of an American. I
have no nationality in business.'
"The shortsightedness of this arises
from the fact that those very agents
to whom ho gave his products for
jMile have a national feeling in their
business, and always, on even terms,
push the products of their own coun
try. English prefer to do business
with English, Germans with Germans
and French with French: but Ameri
cans in this part of the world are
lacking in national business pride and
have suffered for it. No European will
sell an American manufacture unless
he can make much more money out
of it" than he could from similar goods
from his own country. If American
manufacturers expect to handle this
market as their situation entitles them
.to do, they must be represented here
by Americans. A long step toward
this would be the exposition.
"I might multiply instances of
American business which is done here
by men of other nationalities. A lead
ing American commercial body is to
day represented in China by a Ger
man â aA able, scientific man, but his
friends, niÂ« thoughts and his ambi
tions are all German. Our steel manu
factures are all represented here by
firms of foreign nationality, as is also
true of our steamship lines. The. bulk
of our cotton goods Is handled by
firms of other nationality. Even some
of o\ir American firms are officered by
Englishmen; and I wastold within the
week by the head - salesman of an
American firm, himself an English
man, that none but the" coarsest prints
w*re made in Americaâ that it was
necessary to go to England for fine
prints."
TRADE FIEIiD OF CHINA.,
John Barrett, ex-United States Min
ister to Siam, speaking of trade possi
bilities in the Far EaÂ»t. said: "China
presents to-day not only the' most im
portant but the moet Interesting field
of trade expansion and exchange not
yet extensively exploited and appre
ciated by American manufacturers,
exporters and merchants. The entire
Far East, from Singapore and Bang
kok in the south. Yokohama arid Vlad
ivostok In the north, with Its harbor-
Indented coastline of 4000 miles and its
population of over 500,000,000, facing the
Pacific and looking to the east direct
ly opposite 'our American Pacific shore,
looking to the west afford* a mighty
commercial opportunity awaiting our
best efforts.
"However much .we may deplore the
war between Japan and Russia it is a
â¢condition not a theory' that confronts
us and - this letter deals with business
not sentiment. Russia will probably
be too busy to bother . herself about
trade conditions In Northern China and
Japan is not considering a commercial
Invasion of China Juat now. The con
test will of necessity increase' the pur
chase of war supplies arid'- both na
tions will look to us for what food
they cannot supply themselves and one
reason why they will do this is that
the superlative quality of the subsis
tence stores furnished the American
army in China excited the admiration
of the allied armies.
"As one writer put it, 'the advertise
ment given "American, foods , by the
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY. y.FEBRUARY 15, 1904;
quality furnished her troops on the
relief expedition was worth to Amer
ica all that the war cost her.'
"The political situation is ripe for a
successful .American business"' imrnsion
of Eastern Asia. We have not irritated
these people by land grabbing. All our
nation has asked for hasbeen an open
door,* a free,- unhampered fight and no
favors, and under the Tientsin treaties
this is guaranteed us, and the develop-,
ment of China's markets depends upon
our enterprise, our energy and the in
telligent application of our business
ability, in fair competition with the
other commercial nations of the world.
"The diplomatic note of our Secre
tary of State asking all nations to join
in compelling the belligerents to re
spect the integrity. of China will en
dear Americans to the Chinese-govern
ment and people.
"Our Promotion Committee has
done great work for California.
Our Chamber of IComm^ has
ever worked for the. upbuilding
of San Francisco and the Pa
cific Coast. Our Merchants' Associa
tion has been a power for good in
municipal affairs. Our Board of Trade
has ably supplemented. the. work of. the
Chamber of Commerce. The Manufac
turers' and Producers' Association has
safeguarded their interests. The Pa
cific Commercials : Museum has inaugur
ated a work of great importance to
this whole- Coast, but this Oriental
market presents a grander field for
cultivation..
FUTURE B ATTLH G ROUND.
"It is *ure:to become the great battle
ground of producing nations. Our
transportation companies are preparing
to meet all demands that can be made
upon them. Our railroads can double
their tonnage and have shown their
ability to safely and comfortably trans
port special Influxes of fifty or one
hundred thousand visitors like th<Â«
Grand Army of the Republic, the
Shrlners, the Epworth League and the
Knights Templar. The Australian
Pacific and Oriental Steamship com
panies are increasing their fleets in, an
ticipation of this -mighty commercial
contest.
"We claim to be, the greatest pro
ducer, but that army, great or small,
that fights with antiquated weapons;
without leaders, relying upon individual
action; Is sure to go" down to defeat
before â  the well ordered battalions.
Therefore, our commercial bodies, bur
transportation companies, our press
and our people must stand together and
work together with a common purpose
and for the common good."

that satisfactory results will come of our im

GREAT SHOWING FOR PRODUCTS
A great showing for the products of
the Sacramento .Valley was made by
President Steffens, who is quoted as
follows concerning this interesting
phase of development:
The deciduous fruit shipments for 1903. from
this valley, covtrinK a radius of say' fifty
miles from this city,"- were [6010 carloads. The
period. of the seaxon covered was from May 1
to December 1.
The llKUres show that 1 - the Sacrarm ntr> Val

ciduous fruit sent from .- California durlns ; the
s*ason of 10M." Tliey also show that Sacra

output, .at above Btated, ' has brought gocd - re
turns to the grower, and I have reason to be
lieve that the stat*ment made to me Is true
that In this particular the past Â«eaf>on has
been one of the best for many years. If so. It
emphasizes the Idea that a control of a proper
distribution of the fruit in- the Kastern mar
kets is the best assurance to the grower that he
Is to receive, fair.returnsfor-hls labor.-I hope
noon to aee such a well-controlled distribution
eet aside the precedents oft the past, and that It
will respond to the demands of a true spirit
of commerce by ' paying the .grower ''spot
cash" for the products â  which represent his
hurt! labor and his anxious care..

stated thi're were also shipped from point*
north of tbe Tehaclia:il - DA. additional' cars of

SHIPMENT STATISTICS.
Some of the â  products shipped, from
Sacramento were enumerated by Pres
ident Steffens. Tho array was impos
ing. The following r.re some of the
statements a? reduced to figures:
Hops. . 5,400, COO pounds, that were worth' 20
cents -per -pound on the average; vegetables.
18,000,000 pounds; prunes, 2,000,000 pounds;
beans, 1,000,000 sacks;' potatoes, 1,000,000
sacks; canned goods," :i00, 000 caaes; onions,"
250,000 sacks; sweet- wines, C60,000,galIqns;
claret and -brandy, 150,000 gallons; almonds,
800 ton*; flour, i'25,000 barrels; beer, 75,000
barrels; freehflsh," 12."4 tons.
The prunes went largely to Antwerp and
Amsterdam . markets. 'Some of the â  flour . mills
run eighteen hours per day and some ' twenty
four. It Is reported that the . dairy Interest
here pays about 20 per cent better than It does
East. ~'3MBHMMB0I
The output of- fish from thÂ» Sacramento
niver. as shown by the forogolnc table, calls
for a more extended, notice. Of the 1254" tons
shipped. !)44 tons'. were salmon, which mostly
went : to New York and Eastern points, some
going north.' but none of. It going to San Fran
ci*co. Three hundred". and â¢ ten tons were â  cat
fish and were shipped % to Nevada. Utah,
Colorado, Kansas. Missouri and south to Ari
zona and New Mexico. The salmon catch
shows a marked Increase.
In addition to the shipments already,
mentioned there went forward from
Sacrarpehto last year 160" carloads of
strawberries to' Portland, â¢ Seattle': and
to points west of the Missouri River.
Ten carloads of cherries went to New
York. Ripe olives to the â  amount of
125,000 pounds were also shipped.'Busi
ness was good according to the testi
mony; of , the mercantile community arid
also of the bankers of Sacramento. The
building record shows an outlay '-"of
$837,000 for the year, largely for new
homes. It is well known that during
the' early part of last year contracts
were canceled and new plans / laid
aside .owing*; to, the differences, which
then arose between the Building Asso
ciation and the "Building Trades."
KERN COUNTY'S NEEDS..
At the annual meeting of the Kern
County Board of Trade the following
named officers were elected for the

an annual report. The board,perform
ed much valuable work last year.
Speaking of the needs of Bakersfleld,
Secretary Brundage said a municipal
building was required; a park and play
ground for children w^uld make Bak
ersfield.more attractive; tree- planting
should be kept up'for the. sake ''of 'shade
and beauty; better methods of oiling
the streets and keeping; them in -per

to/ 'secure' factories; pump irrigation
should be '-. encouraged. "Water, after
all.'* said Secretary Brundage, "/Is* king;

Prosperity Depends Upon
Wise Course of the
By'-T. â  B. MeMAIIILI.1. Secretary San
.lose Chamber, of Commerce.
â¢One of San Jose's greatest ar.d most
pressing needs is additional. interurban
electric transportation lines. The coun
try about this city is growing in dens
ity of population very fast, and al
though there are now two interurban
iinesin operation and a third soon to
be built, the Berryessa section of our
valley, only distant a few miles from
the center of this city, is in need of
such* service and especially in the hea
viest fruit season, when hundreds of
workers go to and fro from this city to
the orchards and canneries of that part
c-f the valley.
The evergreen section is' in ' the same
condition. Campbell. Mountain View,
Milpitas, Agnews, Morgan Hill and
Gilroy are all sections which would
support such transportation lines well
enough to now more than pay expenses
and within the next two years pay
handsome dividends on"* tho investment.
An electric road to Mount Hamilton
arid the Lick Observatory would cer
tainly cost: far less than the line to
Mount Lowe, in Southern California,
did, ar.d the thousands of tourists who
now gc- there annually by stage would
be quadrupled could the trip* be '.made
on an electric line.
SUBUIIBAN" DISTRICTS.
Another present and fast growing
need of this city, is the taking lri of its
suburban districts, which are so close
to its very center'as to restrict the city
limits far within what they should be,
considering the possible gain in popu
lation by adding, these districts. The
'move "to accomplish this needed â¢im
provement has already taken [ form un
der the direction of the Chamber of
Commerce and promises to be success
fully carried out.
This . city needs to take on more In
debtedness . In the way of bond issues
to provide money for the betterment
of its streets, sidewalks, sewers, fire
system, parks and'all'such other things
as-' go to make the truly- metropolitan
arid progressive city ; of '- this day and
age. The . splendid, city reservation.
Alum Rock Park, will bear the expen
diture of many thousands of dollars
and every dollar so expended will corne
back to > the tax payers of this city, in
increased values : of property and the
building of beautiful . homes and in
crease of. population of the better char-;
acter. /
"There is no man in San Jose doing
a ny^ business worth mention; who is not
in. debt "many times in proportion to
what the city isâ not " without assets
of ample and safe'eharacter, to be sure,
but not as great .by. far as could this
city offer to. its bond purchasers. The
incentives to successful
arid endeavor in these days of high
pfe8sure"iri*busiriesB"and:municlpal life
are obligations to be met which must
be met, -arid the city, progressive and
awake, is like the;business man of the
same stamp, ready to assume that the
future may bring greatness/
The'city of San Jose needs also 'to
add' to it3 present park system, for,
growingas she is; too many fresh air
outlets cannot be provided to safeguard
the health and pleasure of those who
are to' come. The excursion of our
i'300". to Los Angeles - taught many the
lesson of prc-gressiyeness and its power
iri city' building arid country building;
there these citizens were told what they
possessed : In ; their "Alum . Rock Park,"
what it could be. made and what the
"people of the southland thought of it
and 'would give In exchange for' it
could they have it near to Los Angeles.
â CLimS ARK AT WORK.
The 'various ward improvement clubs

CITY NOTEDFOR BEAUTY AND BUSTLE.
lately formed are taking up the work
of having clean streets, clean
sidewalks. new sidewalks where
none now exist, repaired sidewalks,
clean vacant lots, more street tree,s, the
removal of unsightly board fences and
of all fences on city property, the re
moval of all garbage and rubbish by
contract with the city and at 'no ex
pense except by taxation to the house
holders and property owners.
San Jose needs more industrial enter
prises; manufacturing can be carried
ori here at less cost than in almost
any other city on this coast. There are
miles on miles of splendid factory sites
near this citv, there is every advantage
of transportation by .rail and water
and the citizens here need to awaken
to the ; value of industrial enterprises
and to support them with substantial
inducements in the way of free sites
and good bonuses to the proper, parties
who have, money of their own behind
them and something of established
value to produce.
Another need of this city is for more
carefully laid, out restricted residence
tracts, like the Naeglee Park tract The
success with which this tract haa been
placed on the market and the way It
has built up within the last two years
is a lesson on what is "possible along this
line.. There "is every chance for good
investment in this direction. ; and 8an
Jose needs the men of nerve and capi
tal who will tackle this proposition.
ENFORCEMENT OF LAWS.
Along the line of "needs" comes the
want of proper enforcement of laws ex
isting and the making of new laws re
quiring all property owners to put their
places in better condition as a preser
vation from disastrous' fires, of which
this city as it now is stands in danger.
Laws must be made and ways found
to abate the nuisances of lots covered
with weeds, sidewalks. overgrown with
weeds and- covered with; rubbish from
year to year. All this is unsanitary,
unsightly, and no city can progress
with such existing conditions.
Within. herself this city is one of the
richest and most sightly in the world,
and has only the lethargy of her own
people to thank if she falls to make as
tonishing strides forward within the
next five years, when the minds of the
best people of the East are turned Call
f orniaward for homes and Investments
6 rid when every other city in the State
i fast Increasing in population and
vastly improving' in every way.
The awakening of Central and
Northern California to her own wealth
and real possibilities arid to her su
preme advantages over any other sec
tion of this State is at last taking
'place and daily, it is growing in the
minds of the best citizens that the
future Is a great one: and that growth
unprecedented 19 ours if we will but
grasp' the opportunities of to-day.
"Do it now" is becoming the motto
of every progressive citizen and this
method of doing business Is forcing
those who will not to act in spite of
themselves. Do your own duty and
the fellow next door will be forced to
do his or he will be removed and one
will take his place who will.
THE TIJ1E FOR ACTIOX.
Too long has the Northern Califor
nian put off until to-morrow that
which he should have done to-day and
the advancement of Southern Califor
nia has taken place while he waited.
Now Is the time for action, for im
provement, for casting aside old meth
ods of business and adopting new,' for
taking up the work you know you
should have accomplished last year.
Clean off your desks, get the accu
mulated correspondence and details of
years out of the way, get a clean deck
on the ship, get your guns all bur
nished up and shining, load them with
smokeless powder and when you are
called upon to defend your city, your
section, your State, you will be able
to give an account of yourself in the
battle for supremacy which will be
known worldwide and remembered
long after others have taken up the
tools of labor which you have laid
down.
Co-operate for a "Greater San Jose"
was the motto at the banquet given by
our Chamber of Commerce and Mer
chants' Association of San Jose at.
which over 400 sat down last Wednes
day "night, and the slogan' is not to be
forgotten. We have needs and vital
ones and we propose to secure what
we need. ,Be the sacrifice what it may.
let the citizens of California remember
that San Jose is in with them for a
Greater city. Greater Santa Clara Val
ley and a Greater California.

INSTRUCTIVE STUDIES

The Overworked Man.
BT rHAPTjra FREDERIC GOSS. D. D.
(Author of The Redemption of David Corson,"
Etc.)
(Coprrirfct, ISO*, by Joseph B. Bowie*)
There Is always danger of castigat
ing an innocent party when one be
comes a social critic The pupils
of one of the head masters of
Eton declared, "upon their words
of honor," that he found a row
of boys standing in his study .one
morning, and, without a moment's hes
itation, began to thrash them with his
cane. They were too terrified to re
monstrate until he had gone half way
down the line, when one of them pluck
ed up courage enough to falter out:
"Please, sir. we're not up for punish
ment; we are the confirmation class!"
Most of the men upon whom the
blows I am about to administer will
fall may prove to be "domestic mod
els," but I must strike out with 'the
hope of hitting a guilty one among the
innocent now and then.
There is a vicious circle in the rea
soning of the modern business man. "I
want to make a happy home," he says,
"and so must conduct a successful bust
nees. But in order to conduct a suc
cessful business I must give myself to
it body and eoul." But by sacrificing
himself to his business he renders him
self incapable of making a home.
And he does it in this way: The best
energies of his heart and mind are ab
sorbed to 6uch a degree in the conduct
<>f some great commercial enterprise
t hat he has nothing to contribute to do
mestic life when he comes home at
night like a squeezed orange.
The energies of men are not like those
â¢ >f a river. The water that turns the
â¢\ Ivfl of a factory is just as able to
turn that of a grist mill a quarter- of a
mile farther down the stream. But the
man who has poured out the last drop
< f his strength on the wheel of his busi
rÂ«M! Kfmply goes home empty to his
family.' -
Among the most pitiful spectacles in
this world, I put that of the haggard,
'exhausted man of affairs sitting help
letig and useless in the circle about the
fireside. If he is not so nervous and
fretful as to forbid all merriment, he Is
so used up that he cannot enjoy it. If
he realizes his condition he decorates
his face with a emlle. But it is at best
no better than a petrifaction. His
mind is not on the scene or the subject.
His thoughts are down at the shop or
tbe store. He scarcely hears the chil
dren when they speak.
Later in tbe evening his wife may
try to engage his attention upon some
problem of the domestic life. Billy has
not been behaving well at school, or
.Mary is begging to take music lessons,
or Bridget has Just "given notice." or
most likely gone 1 off without as much
as Faying good-by.
She does her best, poor woman, but
even while she is talking she knows by
the look of his'; eye that; his mind' is
wandering.
Pitiful, isn't It? What are we%going
to do about it? It's getting worle all
the time. There is so iÂ«.uch truth in
what the man says about the exac
tions of business that we cannot -help
pitying him. To succeed (or even not
to fall) a man must keep strained up
like* a flddlestring. His competitors
are after him with a knife and toma
hawk, day and night. If they would
only, be reasonable â he could! But
they; won't! The whole pack are as
mad as March hares! There seems to
be no "middle way" to-day. A man
must; either "get rich" or "go broke,"
and that In a mighty short hurry. He
must either march at the head of the
procession or get out of the ranks en
tirely.
Neverthelessâ the dilemma remains.
This man must give more time to his
home or he won't have any. What
.he has now isn't a home. It's only a
bouse. If he has to sacrifice one thing
I :Â£ the other he had better sacrifice the
â¢ business to the home than the home
to the business. And if he says, "How,
can you have a home without a busi
ness?" the answer is, "A simpler home
with a less exacting business."
More love, more peace, more of the
bliss > of the fireside is what this age
needs. Not more fine clothes and bob
tailed horses and long tailed gowns.

(Copyright. 1904. by Joseph B. Bowles.)
And now it is a complete dinner, even
to the toothpicks and a Japanese paper
napkin, in a canâ just warm, turn out
and serve: no cooking, no worry- That
is the latest effort of the prepared food
makers. They have' been heading* in
that direction for some time, and they
boast it will not be long before they
have - solved the vexed servant girt
question, at least so far as it relates to
the culinary end of the domestic estab
lishment. The trend of the times has
been in the direction of prepared foods.
One" can get at almost any , grocery
ready to eat soups, baked beans,
canned meats and almost any kind of
vegetable in hermetically sealed t insâ
.food practically unknown less than a
score of years ago. The quality of these
prepared foods Is generaly equal and
often superior to the average home pro
duct. Some are so much better , than
what can be cooked in a house kitchen
that It Is almost self-evident they only
could be, successfully made in a large
axtd.trell-ordered factory. .
Perhaps the most notable advance In
prepared food products is the so-called
"breakfast" or "health" foods. They
have made the name of Battle Creek a
household word, for In that beautiful
Michigan city the breakfast food was
born and in It most of the many brands
are made.
The flaked wheat food, of which there
are a number of varieties made by as
many concerns under- well-known
names, has become almost a breakfast
necessity 'for a large proportion of
American families. They are all made
In much the same way. Each manu
facturer, however, has, or claims to
have, some secret kind of unique pro
cess which gives his brand of a food a
decided advantage. Thus It Is extreme
ly difficult for one to gain admission to
a Battle Creek factory. One of the
most popular brands Is made in a fac
tory which Is equipped with the newest
machinery and in which the wheat
from the time it is started , on Its way
to the eater is not touched .with so
much aa a finger.
The selection of the wheat has much
to do with the final result, particularly
as regards flavor and appearance.
Only the highest grades are used.' and
the preference is â¢ given to wheat
grown in Oreg-on and Washington, as
It is whiter and contains less starch
than wheat from other localities.
Thousands of carloads of Pacific Coast
wheat have been shipped to a single
Battle Creek factory at a cost of sev
eral cents a bushel over the price of
grain local to that, city. When the
wheat is delivered to the factory it is
carefully inspected and then scoured
by being passed between revolving
brushes, which remove all the fuzz on
the berry. The examination of a grain
of wheat ' under a ten diameter micro
scope will show a gray slate colored
fuzz resembling mold and about a
wagon load of fuzz is' removed from a
carload of wheat. The brushes thus
polish the outside of the wheat berry
until it Is perfectly clean.
Automatic conveyors next take the
wheat to the soaking and curing tanks
âenormous porcelain-lined . affairs,
holding about 200 bushels each. Spring
water is turned into the wheat-filled
tank until the grain is covered. An
expert chemist looks after this initial
process and watches the wheat for
eight to ten hours, when It : Is ready to
be cooked. Some fifty bushels of the
water-swollen wheat Is drawn from
the curing tank by compressed air.
and charged into a horizontal, polished
steel cylinder whose barrel is perforat
ed with longitudinal silts which are
narrow enough to keep the wheat from
falling through and wide enough to
afford free entrance to the live steam,
which does the cooking. This cylinder
is inclosed in another one, and be
tween the two is a steam space of
about two inches. While the wheat ; is
cooking the inner cylinder slowly re
volves, so that the grain is ever in
motion. Fifty or sixty minutes of
steaming is sufficient to thoroughly
cook the wheat and break open the
starch cells.
The grain, which is now : perfectly
cooked, must be partly cooled and'aer
ated. This double result is secured by
permitting: the \vly>at to fall some
thirty feet against an up-rushing cur
rent of filtered air. Pneumatic tubes
then convey the wheat to the top of
the building to curing tanks similar, to
those which first received the grain.
Here the era in cools to a certain tem
perature, and then by automatic ma
chinery is drawn out to be . placed . in
the mixing* tank.
A plated, polished worm screw thor
oughly mixes with the'wheat a quan
tity of the finest quality of barley malt,
equal to from 7 to S per cent of the
wheat. The screw mixes and stirs the
wheat and barley together until the
warm 'wheat berry is coated with the
malt Malt is a great aid to digestion
and is a standard corrective. The action
of the malt on the starch of the wheat
changes the starch to a diastase, . by
which oDeration the first and most try
ing process of * digestion is , performed.
That is where the "health food" propo
sition comes in.
This part of the process of . making
the breakfast . food . requires the closest
attention on the part of ; the supervising
chemist. When the wheat is properly
malted it passes to the crushing-room,
where" hundreds of polished steel rollers
are set up in long: rows, fifteen in each
row. Over the rows is a hopper, into
which the malted grain is dumped by
the, conveyor and from which it passes
down between the rolls to be crushed
into thin, â  moist flakes. Any malt not
taken up by absorption previously is
forced by the rollers into the' flakes.
The crushed wheat falls upon an end
less sterilized canvas belt about a yard
wide, and by it is conveyed toward the
toasting: oven. . â¢
This is a n Immense affair, about â  as
high as a two-story house, having 1 a
cross-section of area eight by twelve
feet. There are a round dozen of these
ovens, and each. is equipped with a se
ries of endless steel curtains, which are
kept in motion by sprocket wheels. The
ovens are heated by a coal fire, which,
of course, is entirely separated from
the oven. The flakes before being fed
Into the oven are again partly dried and
aerated and cooled. They are fed upon
the upper steel apron, which carries
them to the farther end, where they fall
upon another apron moving in the op
posite direction underneath. From this
second apron they fall upon . a third,
and bo on until they have traveled on
seventeen aprons, passing . through a
graduated temperature ranging from
250 to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Thus they
are toasted and become breakfast food.

TRADE IN GOOD CONDITION.
TRADE conditions were more settled last week.
While the great staples were still ; active and sit
times excited there was less fever than during the
preceding week. The great fire at Baltimore and : the
outbreak of the Oriental war were . sufficient to derange"
business, but they hardly caused a ripple on the commer
cial pool. The war had been discounted and therefore
came not as a surprise, but as something expected and
largely prepared for, while the conflagration was met by
a well-supplied and comparatively easy money market,
which : proved equal to the strain, 'so ; both these - adverse
conditions passed over the country like a violent: but
brief thunderstorm over the landscape, immediately^ fol
lowed by blue sky. ;
With cool American philosophy the public was dis
posed to extract all possible "consolation out of the fire.
True, the commercial quarter of- one of the largest and
most important cities had been wiped out, but . it would
have to be rebuilt and millions of dollars would be put
into circulation; thousands of persons given remunera
tive employment and vast quantities ; of â¢ lumber, struct-.,
ural and furnishing material purchased in .the -work: of
reconstruction. "What can't be cured must be endured,"
said the public, and immediately turned its ' attention,
even before the embers \ had become cool, to . rebuilding
the city. There, was no panic and surprisingly little; con
sternation, even while the conflagration was raging,"
which is but another illustration of the fact that the
Americans are without, doubt -among the coolest and
most philosophical in the world. t
The war is regarded in very much the same, spirit;
We are inclined to take the commercial rather titan the
sentimental view of it. War, we say, is a bad thing, but
it has broken out, and the belligerents* must have fvast
supplies for " their' armies and navies, and a large per-,
centage of them must t be obtained in this country, from
our factories and farms; so from a cold-blooded stand
point of dollars and cents the United States will be bene
fited rather than damaged by the Oriental clash. So
the fire and the war pass'overus and leave us calm.
In fact we seem to be passing . through all sorts of
crises without a flurry. That stringent money market
which we 1 anticipated with more or less apprehension last
year has not yet appeared, in spite ofthe Panama' canal
payment of $35,000,000, and the great liquidation in
stocks and iron and steel products of 1003 has left (the
financial interests of the country in much better condi
tion than before.
New York reports large numbers of buyers from; all
parts of the country, showing an expanding merchandise
movement, and the reaction in cotton has again brought
purchasers; of raw material into the market with liberal
orders. Labor conditions are remarkably free from
friction "at the moment. Inclement weather has cut
down distributive trade in some sections, yet the demand
for goods is fuliy up to the average of this time of the
year and the usual depression and hesitation ? character-'
istic of Presidential years have not yet appeared. As
far as all current indications ; go the. country .was never
on a sounder commercial basis ahd ; thepessimism- of 1903
has almost wholly disappeared.
The war has advanced prices of silk, tea, beef "and
pork products and the different grains/ forage? hides and
leather, not to mention a large number of "minor products
of American industry. An increased demand, for
structural Jron and steel and steel rails has placed, the
iron trade on a broader and more profitable basis. 'Wool
is firm, with a steady demand for the raw product. Pro
visions are quieter, but are still in very good movement.
The demand for California dried fruits has suddenly im
proved during the past few days, with a corresponding
steadiness in quotations. Trade in footwear . and cloth
ing is reported exceptionally brisk. About the only ad
verse features at present are the diminished railroad
earnings, due, however, more to unfavorable weather
than to any decrease in the volume :. of trade, and the
recent wild speculation- in cotton, coffee and wheat, * at
whichthe banking interests arc looking with an askant
and repellant eye. The failures arc making a satisfac-.
tory exhibit, those last week numbering ; 228, against 330
for the corresponding week in 1903.
The Wall street stock market is unusually quiet. > Sat
urday-was reported the dullest day on record, only 95,000
shares, selling on the Stock Exchange. The market has
been devoid of especial feature for several weeks.
Prospects in California are bright. The recent rains,
while not as copious in; the southern part of- the State as
might have been desired, have -saved' the crops, for the
present at least, and â¢ as there is an extra demand - for
grain and forage for the Orient in consequence of ', the
war; the outlook for farm products- is better than for
years. The farmer has had very good years, but
if the Japanese purchase what^they are supposed to want
and what they are even now credited with trying to se-!
cure the State v i*mi be put to its trumps to supply their
demands." They "are even now drawing on California,
Oregon and Washington for large lines^of barley/oats
and supposedly hay, and as the coast is not oversupplied
with any of these products it) is .the general .opinion
among the large handlers that prices for all will ; go
higher rather than lower . as the . season advances.
Immigration into this State is at a. rate not witnessed
since the. old gold days and is of 'the finest character,
consisting of actual settlers from the Middle West, and
if the railroads continue their present progressive ; and
intelligent policy of colonizing the State by "means of low,
transportation rates we shall soon have a population un
dreamed of ifi recent years. As for San Francisco, its pop-,
ulatidh is increasing surprisingly, as the most \ casual ob
server may see at a glance along the business "streets
and through the residence districts, and, owing to; the
abnormal activities in the Orient, is rapidly becoming'a
distributing seaport of the first magnitude. Our pros
pects for a good,- year were never brighter than at

TOO MUCH "FRISCO."
EASTERN ' people and Eastern newspapers continue
to refer to this city as "Frisco," though* it x is n%t
our corporate title, nor is it- in. use by our resi
dents. It would scarcely be in keeping withYa healthy
civic pride were San Franciscans to : use such a name for
their/ city. Then how is. it to be regarded when non
residents employ a name,, that is - more familiar and
patronizing than that which we â¢ourselves use?
'inhabitants of this ; city have â  nbt used ; that term since
the early days of California, 'evenif they did then. In
tlÂ«e rough and ready times when Hangtown and Jimtowii
nourished it may have been â¢ a sufficient appellation to
designate a supply town to the mines, but : it is not â¢ con
sistent with the dignity of a metropolitan city^ one of the
foremost and best known in the United States. . , "
A name serves to identify,' a man among his fellows.
Itiis a part of him. and if he carry himself as. he Should
he is jealous of that good name. There are different de
grees of formality expected in employing it, the most
formal being from those least known ; the next, permit
ting a certain license to intimates, as in the custom of
using a given name; and lastly, the most sacred, that in
use'bj one's own family. If ithesc degrees be not ob

even'tc the point of offense. It might justly. offend- 'a
iran to be addressed with a nickname by one to whom
ihcha,d jusi been introduced, while, on the contrary, to be
""Mistered" by one's own family 'would be ridiculous.
With a city the case is analagous. If a man be a good
citizen he should have the same share of pride, in the
name of his corporate family as in his own. This -â¢ city
was named for good St. Francis, arid no. reason exists
for such an appellation as "FriSco.'N

BRITISH MILITARY TRAINING.
REPORTS from London are to the . effect that a
scheme of compulsory, military training, to be put
into operation throughout the British" islands, is
now ; in preparation by the War Office, and will . be sub
mitted to Parliament in the near future. It is to be
noted that the scheme is announced as one of military
"training" and not of military "service.".' The. choice of
words was doubtless dictated by political considerations,
as ; the Ministry would hardly like to face the known
antagonism in Great Britain -to compulsory' military
service. The "use of the milder phrase â  is an easy way^of
evading the popular prejudice, while at the same time
affording the Government ample scope to introduce a
system which will go far to increase the military effi
ciency of the kingdom. ,
The announcement ofthe programme was made origi
nally in the Morning Mail, which in describing it said:
< "The scheme provides for; the military training (un
der the supervision of army officers) of all males between
the ages of eighteen and twenty-two years. The fol
lowing classes, however, will receive exemption: -Men
who, have served in the navy, ex-soldiers, .volunteers,
militia or imperial yeomanry, and- the mercantile marine.
The training will cover a period of four years. In their
eighteenth year the youths. will have two months' physi
cal and other drill (including the use of .arms). 'During
the remaining years a fortnight annually will be utilized
for more advanced drill. Thus a whole, period of some
three and a half months' training will be given, and by
their twenty-third year all young England will be capa
ble of rendering excellent service in case of- need."
.: '^.It is estimated that the normal number of young men
; under: training when the scheme. has been-put into =full
'operation will be about i;t65,ooo.^Of the, total' number,
about 304,000 would be in their first year, while the re-'
mainder would consist of men in the second, third or
fourth year of training, and, therefore, comparatively
well fitted for good service ,in case of- an emergency.
The plan is said to be an outcome of the agitation and
the; work of the "National Service League," and conse
quently will have a powerful body of support among the
pebpleas soon as it is submitted to the consideration of

PROSPERITY IN HUMBOiLDT.
CALIFORNIA hopes' to have a thorough exploita
tion, of her resources at the St. Louis Expo
sition. We will send there our fruits, our ores,
sacks of our; grain from the interior and samples of our
woods' from thc^ mountains.' Every physical manifesta
tionof'our well being will be installed for the edifica
tion and possible allurement of "the public. If /figures

v By careful tabulation N of the arrival and departure of
all yesiseis which . have visited Humboldt Bay during 'the
year 1903, the Commissioners show^ that the pbrtO'lof
:Â£urÂ»*k| is rapidly becoming the shipping center, second
"only to San Francisco and San Pedro, . on the whole
coaH .south of Portland. .For the year past the records
shov.' a total number of 749 arrivals 'of vessels from
coastwise ports, Â» the islands and Australian and South
American harbors. These, sailing away with the car
goes of lumber, dairy products and meat, stuffs,' have
raised the total value of : all exportations.for the year of
1903 to the sum of $7,361,370, an excess in value over all
imports 1 of '$2)733,991. The total value of exports for the
year 1902 falls below the present figure by more than a
million.- â }â 'â *â -<â  â¢

New Signals at S<
One of the most formidable prob
lems of coastwise navigation by which
mariners are confronted is the diffi
culty of determining the direction from
which fog-bells and "signals come, the
apparent direction of the location of
the sound being dependent to a large
degree on the condition of the atmo
sphere. If vessels could run from light
ship : to light-ship infallibly by sound,
as they do by sight In fair weather,
the improvement would amount almost
to a revolution in coastwise traffic. A
new system of ; submarine bell signal
ing .which seems to solve the problem
is described In an interesting article
by H. C. Gauss, in Harper's Weekly.
The apparatus may be briefly de
scribed as follows: Each of the four
steamers of the line on which the sys
tem is being tried - are equipped with
microphone transmitters of new and
peculiar . construction, which - take up
from* the sea water the vibrations im
parted by. bells suspended by chains
from the respective light-ships, and the
Impulses' forwarded to telephone, re
ceivers in the pilot houses record with
accuracy the direction of the location
of the; bells and an approximation of
the distance.

that : . the pictures were turned . round,

riously disappeared. It was afterward
discovered in a locked cupboard. Rumor
states that farm hands are so scared

Beveridge as a Logger.
Senator Beveridge, author .of The
Russian Advance, was a logger In early
youth, and at sixteen was boss of a
logging camp. It is said that to this
day he is an expert logger. An amus
ing Incident occurred during . the last
Congressional campaign In Indiana.
Senator Beveridge spoke at a certain
town and was driving across country
to make* a train* for the next appoint
ment. At a point where the road
crossed the railroad track, the Sena
tor found some men trying to load
heavy. logs on a flat-car. He told the
driver to stop, and after watching the
work for a moment he said to the man
In charge:
"You have those skids and chains
fixed wrong, and you are chocking
that log wrong,' too. If you do things
this way, some of you will get hurt
badly." , .
Resenting the Interference of a
stranger, the man replied:
"What the â 'â  do you know about
it?"
"I will show you," said Senator Bev
eridge, getting out of his buggy. He
then adjusted things properly, showing
where the men were putting themselves
ih danger by a wrong method.
They watched rather sheepishly, but.
finding the. stranger in the right,
promptly acknowledged It and thanked
him as he climbed back in his buggy.
Thereupon the local politician who was
driving the Senator, told .the log-men
.who it was to whom they were talk
ing \ . ..:;". :':.';-v.
"Well. I'D be - !?â¢ said the fore-.
man. "That settles it. I am for Albert

that township, but now he Is one of the
hottest adherents the Senator has in

question. "Can a man born of citizens
of the United States In a foreign coun
try become President of the United
States?" has never been judicially de
cided.. The constitution of the United
States says that to be eligible the Indi
vidual must be "a native born citizen."
The presumption Is that the constitu
tion means that the person must have
been born on United States territory. A
child born of United States citizens in
a foreign country, when the parents ar a
temporarily sojourning in such country
or are In the service of the Unite*
States, <s a native of the country In
whi.h born, but a citizen of the United
States. Whether such would be con
strued by the United States Supreme
Court as coming within the' provision,
'â¢native born citizen." Is a matter that
will only be known after argument be
fore that body. â¢ should it ever be
brought before that tribunal. A natur
alized 'citizen* is not : eligible . to the
Presidency. If a person was born
in the city, of New York of Welsh par
ents, who never became citizens of the
United States, such person Is in the
common acceptation of the term an
American, not a Welshman, but if on
attaining majority such person elects
to become a citizen of the country of
his parents he is at liberty to do so, by
some overt act. and having once done
that he Is' recognized as a citizen of
that country. Should such person at
any future'; time decide to be a citizen
of the United States he would have to
be naturalized the same as any other
alien, notwithstanding ' that he was

INFORMALITY WILL MARK FUNCTIONS OF LENTEN DAYS
General Satisfaction Expressed at the Election of Mrs. George Law Smith as
President of the State Organization.
The convention of the State Federa
tion of Women's Clubs has passed into
history â the history of clubdom. Spec
ulations are over, and at the helm
stands Mrs. George Law Smith, the
president of the California Club. This
subversion of a few prearranged plans
seems to have met with the enthusi
astic commendation of nine-tenths of
the 2S.OO0 clubwomen of the State. The
fact of a new successor being elected
to thÂ» presidency of the State body â
rather than the re-election of Mrs. L.
*". Darling, who, by the way. has
made a most capable and efficient offi
cer â stamped the presidency as dis
tinctly a one-term office.
That precedent uppermost in the
minds of the delegates, natural acces
sion would bring 4he honors to Mrs.
Smith, who was acting vice president
of the State body and a representative
from the north â north ' Tehachapi.
There is, let it be said, a verbal or a
mental treaty existing between the
clubs in t&e southland and those above
the pass that presidential honors be
divided evenly between them.
Now, let the fact be cried out from
the housetops that the southern dele
gations stood pluckily by Mrs. Smith,
a splendid protagonism coming from
them. Whatever of onnosltion there
â was to Mrs. Smith's election was not a
manifestation of hostility toward her
personally, but rather a desire to di
vert the honor to some northern club
other than the California, for it is
claimed, and justly, that the California
Club is too much in the public eye.
Eut what is a club to do when its pop
ularity emanates from the work It
does? Surely it cannot hide Its light
under a bushel. When the Juvenile
Court measure, the Big Trees agita
tion and the traveling libre.ries origi
nated in the club, and the work in
each is still actively prosecuted, why
should the club not talk about it?
Likewise, how can the club help be
lnp: talked about? These things con
sidered, it is apparent that the small
mÂ«ed of antagonism to the election of
the California's president to the presi
dency of the federation is not well
founded. And as to her personal fit
r>eps â which necessarily includes ap
l>earance, personality, judarment, tact
and a Quick grasp of facts and de
tailsâthere are but few women in Cal
ifornia more adaptable.
The selection of a. presiding officer
this year was a vital i?sue, because it
is she who will represent the clubs of
California at the biennial at St. Louis
in May. She. together with represent
atives from the six districts and two
delegates at large, whom the presi
dent will appoint.

corrections will hold a three days'
session, at which matters of absorbing
interest to sociologists â or to all who
are interested in the betterment of the
dependent, the deficient and the de
praved classes â will be discussed.
While oftimes but little immediate
benefit accrues from discussions of this
kind, nevertheless the agitation pro
motes the growth of our knowledge of
these ever-present problems. The sub
jects, as problems to be solved in a
systematic manner, are of rather re
cent origin, and cwry ray of light is
needed from all sources.
The convention will continue for
three days, when the following live
topics will be discussed (with one
possible change) :

The San Jose Women's Club is
again prosecuting an active campaign
â led by the indefatigable Mrs. E. O.
Smith and Mrs. Kennedy â for the
civic improvement of the Garden City.
Whatever plans the ladies have in
view will materialize â unless some
thing awful happens. Those women in
the San Jose Club are terribly in
earnest when they get busy, for note
the tremendous success of their festi
val last summer. That Indian congress
stands out in club annals as a scintil
lating example of what women can do
â when they will.
From * the decisive tenor of the
ladies' decision to improve San Jose,
the men had better get into line;- 'tis
so much "gracefuller" to slip in now,
at the start, than to be whipped in
later, for what politician â or other
mere man â could hope to hold out
against the organized will of such
women as guide the destinies of this
club?
The Wlmodausis Club has been
making- good progress along cultural
lines this winter, making analyses of
characters in the best modern fiction.
Along these lines some really clever
papers have been presented.
For the, month of March the club
will discuss "The Turkish Question,"
and later "The Parties of Labor," by
Wilkins, which will, of course, involve
a ventilation of the subject of strikes,
labor unions and carrelative topics.
The following is an encouraging en
comium upon the proselyting power of
the Outdoor Art League, of which
Mrs. Lovell White is president. The
excerpt is from the Chicago Herald:
Just now the club women throughout the
land are Interested In gaining the Interest in
and "laying the wlrte" for the pannage of
the bill urging the preservation of the Cala
veras big trees of California, through their
purchase by the Government. The former
bills, although approved by the public lands
committee, have failed to secure a hearing
In the HouÂ«e of Representatives. The pres
ent bill haÂ« been framed and the need of Its
passage urged by the big tree committee of
the Outdoor Art I>ag-ue of California. The
plea for Interest and membership is set forth
In these words:
The Outdoor Art League has resolved to
make the preservation of the Calaveras groves
a national affair. And to this end a council
is being orKacized of influential men ami
women in each State, whose purpose Is to aid
in forming a strong congressional committee,
whose duty shall be to act in conjunction with
the California representatives In devising ways
and mean* for eecuring the passage of the big
tree bill. The Calaveras groveg are the finest
and most accessible of all the California groves
of big trees, and are theretore the most valu
able to scientists and for the enjoyment of the
citizens of the world. Will you become a
member of your State council and aid In for
warding- the Interests of the Calaveras big
tree bill?
Some of the facts sent out In the summary
about the trees, which have caused the cru
sade against their destruction, are contained in
the report of the division of forestry, and are
Interesting, nut only to those who are Callfor
nlans, but to all Americans who have visited
th<Â»se wonderful rrovca. and, in fact, to all
who feel u. national, pride In the preservation
of any natural sift* to the land:
1. The dimensions of the big tree are un
equaled.
2. The ape of the bir tree make* It tht
oldest thing living.
3. The majestic beauty of the big tree Is
unique and world renowned. ,
4. It now exists only in ten Isolated grove*
on the west slope of the Sierra Nevada Moun
tains, and nowhere else In the world.
6. The Maripoea Grove Is to-day the only
one of consequence â which is completely pro
tected. - 9 v
C. Most of the scattered grove* of big trees
are privately owned and therefore In danger
of destruction.
7. Lumbering is rapidly sweeping them off;
forty mills and logging companies are now at
work wholly of In part upon big tree timber.
8. The southern groves ehow some repro
duction, through which there is hope of per
petuating these groves: In the northern grove*
the epecie* hardly holds Its own.
9. The species represent* a surviving pre
historic renu* cf tree* once growing widely
over the globe.
Council* have been formed la twenty-two
States and club women In every State are
actively engaced In advocating the passage of
the bill, as are scientists and prominent men
everywhere. Eight State federations and many
chapters of the Daughters of the. American
Revolution have Indorsed the bill and written
lettem urging its passage. The California Art
League is an affiliated society of the Women 1 *
Auxiliary and American Park and Outdoor Art
Association. Mr*. Charle* F. MlllKpaugh is the

RABBI SPEAKS
TO UNITARIANS
Dr. J. Voorsangrer Occupies the
Rev. Mr. Leavitt's Pulpit and
Delivers a Powerful Sermon
Rabbi Voorsanger occupied the pulpit
at the First Unitarian Church yester
day afternoon in the absence of the
Rev. Bradford Leavitt, who preached
at Stanford University. There was a
large ' congregation and the subject
chosen by Rabbi Voorsanger was "The
Protesting Influence of Propheticism."
The rabbi said:
It is certainly a remarkable fact that the
idealism Of the prophet* of Israel had been
able to maintain itself. deKpite the denial of
Its integrity by every successive civilization.
However highly the Jew thought of the basic
principles of his religion, it is certain that the
nations susrounded theao principles with sus
picion.
Palestine is but one-thirteenth the size of
California, and iÂ» surrounded by nations each
of which has played an important role In the
history of the world. There were Phoenicia
and Syria on the north, Assyria on the north
cast. Babylonia on the southeast and mighty
Egypt on the southwest.
In later times the handful of Jews in Pal
estine was fronted by Greece and still later
by the world force of Rome.
To say to all these mighty empires, each
representing a distinct phase in human civili
zation, that their culture reatedp on false
premises and that, therefore It would bo
swallowed up in the evolution of the ages, ap
pears like supererogation, an expression of ar
rogance for which, I fear, the world has never
forgiven the Jew. And yet history is but the
story of the 'decline of those empires and of
the vindication of prophetical Ideals which is
attested by the national records of the Jew
to the dignity of an international literature.
In the application of these Ideals we come
to the conclusion that es long as civilization
consists of the irere manifestation of physical
and mental energies it cannot endure.
rnopiiETiciSM's teaching.
Propheticism holds that happiness exists In
the harmony of spiritual â  and physical ener
gy. It preaches the constitutional character of
peace a* precedent to an acknowledgment of
God.
Whenever war exists the world usually
cross-examines it* own belier in God. War is
inconsistent with any belief in God. Peace Ik
not the stagnancy of undeveloped condi
tions, but the harmony of divinity and
humanity. A* long, therefore, as war and
all other passions continue to exist the
world In the prophetic aspect needs the con
tinuance of that manifestation by which God
is cognizant in human affairs. In other and
briefer words, God is not groat enough yet.
humanely speaking. When he will be the
ideals of the .proDhcts will become the con
stitution of mankind and civilization will rep
resent the complete harmony of God and man.
WARNS Tlffi ANGLO-SAXON.
And in this respect a word of caution might
be addressed to the great Anglo-Saxon race.
Uarely 4,000.000 in the time of Queen Eliza
beth, it now represents 10 per- cent of the
population of the earth. Â«- 140.000,000. mainly
contained within the. two countries that stand
in' history for the maintenance of doctrines
by which man has attained to his true dig
nity â the doctrines of freedom of conscience
and government by the people. But Is it not
natural, that in the manifestation of Its phys
ical forces this tremendous race should - seek
to dominate the earth because of the natural
manifestation of Its inherent strength? .
In th* inevitable conflicts of the future, the
Anglo-Saxon will match and measure his
strength with : other dominant races, because
history proves that only one - race can be
dominant on the faco of the earth at any
on* time. For that very reason, tho greatest
need of this powerful race. at the present
time Is Its centlc subordination to the proc
esses by which it may promote the harmony
of Us spiritual- and physical energies lest in
the â¢ arrogant assertion of its physical proweea
and 1U mere love of domlnancy it undermine
Its own vltailty and so . prepare the- time
when its' history,' Instead- of being :â¢ a witness
of - God â  on . earth, will be a mere â  chanter in
archaeology, spelled in . the . hieroglyphics of a
dead and departed people* \
FAVORITISM IS .
CHECKED IN
THE NAVY
Secretary Moody has decided not to
assign to duty in Washington, except
in a few unusual cases, officers who
have within late years had shore de
tails at the capital. He has directed
the Bureau of Navigation to refer all
applications for such duty to him. This
new rule will meet with almost general
approval by naval officers and it strikes
a blow at the so-called "Washington
navy," that will seriously affect its in
dividual members. It was the custom
for many years for a few chosen offi
cers to regularly return to Washington
after a cruise at sea. Walker; Ramsay,
Pythian, Luce, Bradford and Crownin
shield thus established and continued
an oligarchy, the aims of which was
personal comfort and power, and offi
cers who did not belong to this coterie
had to take such shore duty as the
others did not want. Much of the ill
feeling in the navy between the line
and staff corps owes its origin to the
practice of continuing one particular
set of officers on duty in Washington.
The agitation for increase of pay, rank
and additional power has emanated
from the Washington navy, and its lat
est attempt to usurp the powers of the
Secretary of the Navy by the crea
tion of a general staff has probably
prompted Mr. Moody to go to the root
of the evil by disbanding the shore
navy in Washington.
There was only one bid presented at
Washington January 30 for the con
struction of a arydock at the New York
navy yard. The offer was $1,082,246, and
as the appropriation Is only $1,000,000,
the bid was rejected. The Navy De
partment has not yet decided whether
it will advertise for further proposal.
An appropriation of $200,000 was made
for this dock on June 7, 1900, and if the
Bureau of Yards and Docks should de
cfde to readvertise for bids, the work,
if finally contracted for, would not be
under progress until next June, after a
delay of five years, notwithstanding
the fact that large docks are greatly
needed in our navy yards.
TO RELIEVE SHIPBUILDERS.
Senator Lodge has introduced a bill
for the relief of eleven shipbuilding firms
which, under contracts of 1898, built
sixteen destroyers and twelve torpedo
boats for the United States navy at
such insufficient prices as to entail
great losses to the builders. Senator
Hale Indorses the bill and has present
ed a statement of alleged facts relating
to these boats, which statement has
been prepared by Mr. Bowles, recently
chief constructor of the United States
navy but now employed by the Fore
River Company, and also acting as
claim agent for the applicants for re
lief. . As stated in The Call last week,
the destroyers were contracted for at
an average price of $281,750, and the
torpedo boats at $152,921. A naval board
convened In February, 1902, to ascertain
the actual cost of the boats obtained
statements from ten firms giving the
requisite, information, and on. April 2,
1902, recommended that the contractors
be paid one-half of the losses incurred,
and Secretary Long referred the matter
to Congress, with the following expla
nation: "It appears â¢ â¢ â¢ . that the
plans and specifications furnished by
the department to the contractors for
the building of these boats, and which
were based \ upon the most successful
local and foreign experience, were not
impracticable and admitted of the pro
duction by development, with the ap
plication of skill and experience, of suc
cessful boats, but with a narrow mar
gin." This important contention by Mr.
I/Ong refutes the statement of Mr.
Bowles that the "evident defects In the
department's design rendered them Im
possible of execution." The chief
causes which led to the failure to come
up to the required speed, the excess of
cost and length of time were the abso
lute lack of knowledge of building tor
pedo-boats. Six of the contracting
firms had never built such vessejs, and
only the Union Iron Works, Bath Iron
Works, Columbian Iron Works, Gas
Engine Company and the Harlan and
Hollingsworth firms had had some ex
perience in that line.
CONTRACTORS TO BLAME.
Nevertheless, the inexperienced con
tractors . off ered to build, faster boats
than the department asked for and at
a less cost per ton than any previous
boats had been built for. Seven of the
destroyers and five torpedo boats were
built on plans submitted by the con
tractors, for the failure of which they
consequently became solely responsi
ble, and In the sixteen boats built on
department plans, where the margin
was narrow, the SDecifications were
not followed, and large Increases in
weiKht of material were made, with
consequent increase In displacement,
and where the boats were tried on the
designed displacement the majority
failed to come up- to the speed con
tracted for and barely reached the
modified requirement of a one-hour
run at reduced speeds. The failure of
the contractors to obtain material and
the consequent delay in construction
is another argument advanced for
obtaining relief, but such an excuse
would not be accepted by any private
concern for non-fulfillment of con
tract andishould carry no weight with
Congress.! Nevertheless, the bill of re
lief. Involving a gift of $2,695,450, in
cluding $539,600 to the Bath Iron
Works, is pretty aure to pass, as the
contractors and their suffering bonds
men and financial backers are located
in seven States, and are able to bring
the requisite influence to bear on their
Representatives in Consrress. The
annexed table shows the financial
statement regarding twentyvflve of the
destroyers and torpedo boats. In order
to make It clear it should be explained
that the column of cost to the con
tractors is that presented by the sev
eral builders. Thus, while the Colum
bian Iron Works took a contract for
'$168,000, it expended,; it is Raid, $264,
247, sustaining a loss of $96,247, and
Congress is asked to give the concern
366,300,. as a partial relief from its
losses through inexperience and lack
of business capacity. The following Is
the statement: *

yesterday after a very quick run up
from Honolulu. Her time was 5 days
and 13 hours. She brings a large num

Is full of a valuable cargo consisting
in part of 787 cases of opium, 1935 bales
of raw Bilk valued at $1,354,500 and 1,

off the coast she encountered a dense

up to the dock, which she reached at
low water, and It took nearly two
hours to get her into her berth, even

RIVERSIDE, Feb. 14. âThe Salt

entrance into Riverside by capturing a
section of the right-of-way, which has
been in dispute. Three hundred men
were stationed along the road and at 1
o'clock, at a given signal, they set to
work laying rails. At daylight this
morning the rails had been laid to their

The railroad now has possession and
what course the objectors will take is

CARTER MAKES
ISLAND TOUR
Governor of Hawaii Visits
Various Districts and
Discusses the Country's Needs
ANCIENT CUSTOMS IN USE
Executive Pleases Natives by
Advocating County Govern
ment for the Territory
HONOLULU, T. H., Feb. 8. â Gov
ernor Carter and Secretary of the
Territory Atkinson are still on the Is
land of Hawaii, making a tour of the
various districts. Large meetings have
been held at many points, at which
Carter discussed with the natives and
other citizens the policies of the ad
ministration. The keynote of most of
Carter's adresses to the natives is that
he wants their advice and co-opera
tion, and wants them to assist in elect
ing a Legislature that will co-operate
with him as executive. Carter's trip
is the first of the kind made by the
head of the island government for
many years, the last having been by
King Kalakaua.
In the outlying districts, where the
native Hawaiian remains in conditions
near to those of ancient days, the
Governor Is greeted as a chief, and in
one Hawaii district an aged native,
following an old custom under which
the people made presents to their
chiefs, gave the Governor a $5 gold
piece, which was a large sum to the
donor. In most of his addresses
Carter declares strongly for county
government, for which the natives
have been agitating ever since Hawaii
became a Territory. The Governor
said in a speech at Hilo that, in view
of the recent decision of the Terri
torial Supreme Court, he did not think
that the Hawaiian Legislature had
power to pass a suitable county act,
and that the Territory must either ask
Congress to amend the act or ask Con
gress to pass a Hawaiian county act.
The Right Kind of Newspaper.
A newspaper is a vehicle of pub
licity. Its most important function
is to publish the news. The improve
ment of its facilities for getting: the
news and of the methods of present
ing news has, therefore, been a not
able advance In journalism. Moreover,
it Is not strange that there should
have been a reaction from the old
style heavy editorial "leader." The
demand was for something more di
rect and simple. But it is a law of
every such movement that It is nec
essarily carried to extremes. Many
newspapers were bo far influenced by
the revolution In Journalism that with
few exceptions there has been a low
ering of editorial power. The im
provement in the news pages has not
been a full compensation for this loss,
especially as the news pages them
selves have been corrupted by the ad
vent of the "yellow journalism." In
stead of editorials we have now com
ment in headlines and cartoons and
editorialized news. Readers arc
sought to be influenced by opinions
dexterously presented . in "spread"
stories.; This coloring of news by ed
itorial opinion is" In every way unfor
tunate. The Ideal is the news pre
sented without any bias or color what
ever, and then forcible .comment in
the proper place, the editorial page,
by men of high mental power and
trained in the art of expounding the
news of the day so as to give the
reader an intelligent idea of Its true
significance, thus leading them to
sound opinions. â Wall Street Journal.
Tiie Old Jiunel Mansion.
The final passing of the Morris-
Jumel mansion into the custody of the
city is a more satisfactory circum
stance than the preservation of the
old Hall of Records would have been.
The old hall was obstructive. It was
ugly, it had been altered out of recog
nition, and its history was neither long
nor pleasant. The Jumel mansion, on
the contrary, is a fine specimen j of
colonial architecture, surrounded by a
fine old garden, and it stands at a
point where it is not likely to become
an obstruction to the so-called im
provements which are ravaging the
town. It was the headquarters of
Washington during the skirmishing on
Harlem Heights, that foltowed the re
treat of the American army after the
disastrous battle in , Brooklyn; It was
the home of the general's former
sweetheart; it afterward came into
possession of Madame Jumel, who
shared it for a time. with Aaron Burr;
thus it instances tradition and history.
It will be converted Into a museum for
the preservation of relics, but, it Is the
best museum in itself. It is a land
mark from which we date our depart
ure, and probably our progress, in the
building of cities and the extension of
comforts. It deserves preservation not
because of practical usefulness, but
because of Its beauty and the need to
keep a few yards of Manhattan free
from shops and flats. There are sev
eral rival claimants for the mansion,
various sons, daughters, nephews and
nieces of the revolution and the colon
ists wrangling, for precedence, so the
easy settlement of their claims is to
give It to none of them, but let it pass
to the Park Department. â Brooklyn

Annexation of Texas.
During the nine months that Polk
was annexing Texas, says the Galves
ton News, the Whigs bitterly denounced
him. The turning point of abuse was
his use of the army, and navy to keep
off Mexico from assailing Texas, as
Roosevelt is now using it, without con
sent of Congress, to keep off Colombia
from attacking Panama.
The two parties have swapped theo
ries of the constitution and exchanged
sides. The Democrats are now. In the
rear observation car of the onward
train applying air brakes, while the
Republicans are, on the. engine shovel
ing coals into the furnace, - increasing
steam pressure and speed. .
Polk occupied with the army the part
of Texas between the Nueces and the
Rio Grande. Mexico wanted him to de
part from what Mexico claimed as
hers; he refused/because the place be
longed to Texas. The -Whigs foamed
with rage. A reconnoitering party of
ours was attacked by Mexicans atPoint

ico." Will war with Colombia in like
manner come . "by, act of Colombia" ? â

Prophet of Zion Objects to

During Trip to Honolulu

Special Correspondence of The Call.
HONOLULU, Feb. 1. â The head of
Zion, John Alexander Dowle, was not
a favorite with the other passengers on
the trip of the Sonoma from San Fran
cisco to Honolulu. He objected to the
merriment of ordinary mortals who
didn't have to hold up any prophet's
mantle and finally refused, with all thÂ«
members of his party, to sign some res
olutions which were enthusiastically
adopted by the rest, complimenting
Captain Herriman, master of the ves
sel.
On the night before arriving here the
Sonoma had a special dinner, according
to a pleasant custom for the last night
before reaching port, where fellow pas
sengers are to separate. The resolu
tions were produced and there were
cheers for Herriman, much to the dis
gust of Dowle. On one occasion Dowle
resented the smoking of a cigar and
sent a waiter to tell a passenger to
throw it overboard.
The following are the resolutions,
signed by the passengers, which Elijah
did not sign,' and which the large
crowd In the dlning-saloon approved
with a frivolous hilarity not tolerated
In Zion: : ,
"Whereas a large number of the pas
sengers of the. steamship Sonoma are
about to leave Bhip. while .others are to
continue to Its terminal voyage, we
who depart, as well as those who con
tinue on, desire to express to its emi
nent commander our appreciation of his
fellowship and his geniality. During
the questionable moments of our Initial
trip his kindness and good cheer were
like the balm of Gilead and at the re
sumption of our normal condition his
good humor, ready wit and ever pres
ent companionship were as pleasures
In the Grove of Daphne.
Therefore be it resolved. That we, the
passengers of the Sonoma, extend to
him. Captain Herriman, our thanks,
our appreciation of those kindly serv
ices, not alone the mark of a good com
mander, but the surer evidence of a
good friend and a gentleman.
"Resolved, That to each officer asso
ciated with Captain Herriman we like
wise extend our good offices and appre
ciative greetings."
The Caspian Sea.
One of the most remarkable physical
features of the globe is the deep and
wide depression in the hollow of which
stands the Caspian Sea, and near to It
the Sea of Aral. The Caspian \s nearly
as large as France, and its surface is
eighty-four feet below the level of the
Black Sea. The Sea of Aral Is nearly
as large as Ireland, and is very little
over the sea level. Within recent geo
logical times the vast expanse in which
these lakes are found was sea. Its floor
has been gradually raised, and the
waters filling the depressions are all
that is left of an anicent Mediterra
nean. A strange feature of both bodies
of water is that, although they receive
large rivers, especially the Caspian,
into which the Volga, the Ural River
and scores of streams from the Cau
casus flow, both have for many years
been getting shallower. Evaporation,
for they have no outlet, exceeded the
Inflow. But, for some climatic reason
probably. Lake Aral and its neighbor,
Lake Balkhash, have since 1891 been
increasing in depth. Nature reports
that At. Berg visited Lake Balkhash
last summer and found that the level
was rising with comparative rapidity.
Whereas the Caspian, like the Dead Sea,
is very salt, owing to the rate of evap
oration, Aral and Balkhash are brack
ish only. These remnants of what was
once a*, great sea opening Into the
ocean, as the Mediterranean does now,
still contain marine fish and seals.
Some of the latter survive in the Aral
and Baikal lakes, having gradually be
come fitted for their habitat, though it
is no longer salt, but merely brajekish,
and In the case of Bailkal actually
fresh water. â London Telegraph.
Old Cold Cure.
The advice given by a parent to his
son at Oxford in the year 1686 against
catching cold when attending the
theater will not be without interest
in the pantomime season. "Child â I
heard that the players are gon down
to Oxford, but I am unwilling that you
should go to see them act, for fear on
your coming out of the hot playhouse
into the cold ,ayer, you should catch
harm, for as I did once coming out of
the theater at a public act when it was
very full and steaming hot, and walk-
In a Broad In the cold, and gave me
sutch a cold that it had Likt to a cost
me my life. Your best way in sutch a
cold is to go hom to your chamber
directly from the playhouse, and drink
a glass of Sack, therefur Be sure you
send your servant At your hand for a
bottle of the Best Canary and keep It
in your chamber for that purpose:
Harken thou unto the voyce and Ad
vise of mee Thy ffather, Loving Thee
Better than himselfe." â London
Chronicle.
To Abolish Chaplains.
The reorganization of the personnel
of the English navy, which Lord Sel
borne began at the end of last year,
is not yet completed. Two important
changes are pending â the merging of
the accountant branch and the aboli
tion of chaplains. In a word, the pay
master and the parson are shortly to
disappear. .The supervision of the for
mer department will henceforward be
delegated to superior officers. In fact,
the paymaster of the near future will
be as much an executive "specialist"
as the existing gurfnery, torpedo and
navigating- officers are now. With re
gard to the chaplains It has long been
felt that all the duties thati they are
called upon to perform can well be
carried, out by the captain or com
mander. In some ships the chaplain
is also naval instructor, but the. duties
of this latter offlceÂ»are to be delegated
to some other rank.â New York Com

Jonah and the Whale.
.. . -As in the case of the story of Jonah
and his brief but intimate acquaintance
â¢with the whale, questions have been
raised about the authenticity of the
Etpry of the trip of the first houseboat,
:he ark. Was it possible to construct
i. vessel having the reputed capacity of
that famous craft? What were its di
rrensJons, anyway? These questions
have buzzed in the head of more than
one "old subscriber" and "constant
leader." The editor of the Syren and
Shipping has undertaken to answer
these questions and to lay for all time
t>r,y doubts as to whether the writer of
the story of the deluge was ignoi^nt of
the subject of shipbuilding. "Within
th<* last ten years," he says, "the gen
eral .dimensions of the ark have been
closely followed by cargo steamship
builders for de^p sea and the American
gicat lakes service. According to the
Bible the ark was 4S0 feet long, 80 feet
wide 8nd <S feet deep. Hnr tonnage
was 11.413, and she had plenty of room
for pairs of all the distinct species jf
zr.irnals that are classed by Buffonâ
2H â and she could have accommodated
3000 persons and then have plenty of
room for the storage of supplies. In
the" seventeenth century Peter Jansen,
a Hollander, built a vessel of the exact
rroportlons of the ark and she was
successful, as records of the* times
thow/ in making money for her owners.
r.'oiih, 'the father of naval architecture,'
is held in profound respect by naval
architects of to-day, who know how
Immeasurably the Phoenicians, Greeks
aud Romans and all other shipbuilders

POLOISIS PLAY
IN THE RAIN
The Inclement Weather Does
Not Keep the Enthusiasts
From Their Favorite Pastime
REDS ARE VICTORIOUS
Score Six Goals to Opponents
Four Chiefly Through Work of
R. M. Tobin and L. McCrecry
The polojsts of the Burlingame
Country Club are commencing to feel
they are public benefactors as rain
makers. The mere announcement of a
polo game causes the clouds to Rather
and upon the appearance of the
ponies rain is sure to descend. These
were the conditions yesterday, but the
players were keen for a game and
they played through the driving mists.
The match attracted the largest
"gallery" of the season and the fair
spectators braved the elements and
saw the game out.
This was the match originally sched
uled Cor last Thursday and it proved
one of the best of the season. Five of
the visiting players took part. The
field was slippery and the player? were
not able to turn their ponies quickly.
The latter showed a noticeable lack of
condition, not having been played for
several days. The teams lined up:
REDS. WHITES.
Captain Chaplin. . F. .T. Â« ,r Ian.
R. SI. Tobln. F. J. Mackey.
Basil William. C. Raoul-Duvai.
L. McCreery. Captain Neil Halg.
Referee rhsrlfF Garland.
Umpire â E. E. Ezra
Timekeeper â J. O. Tobln.
The Reds won ultimately by a score
of six goals to four. Lawrence Mc-
Creery and R. M. Tobin made some
brilliant strokes and drew rounds of ap
plause from the spectators. The former
drove the ball early in the first round,
with one stroke, from the side line, near
the middle of the field, to Just outside
the goal post, failing to score by Inches.
He was more successful later in the
period, running the ball down the field
for a goal. The Whites also scored in
this period.
Captain Haig scored for the Whites
in the second period after a lot of fast
play. R. M. T<rbin evened the score in
the third period, but Charles Duval
placed the Whites one ahead before the
I bell sounded.
R. M. Tobin tied the score again in
the fourth period. F. J. Mackey pre
vented the Reds from scoring on three
occasions in this period. Each time he
sent the ball out of danger as it was
about to roll between the posts. .
The Reds scored twice In the fifth
period, Basil Williams and L. Mc-
Creery being the successful players. In
this period Mackey's pony fell, but as
he did not struggle no damage was
done and his rider was soon in the
thick of the scrimmage.
The comedy element of the game was
supplied by Haig and Williams in the
last period. They Indulged in a fierce
bumping match, but both came off un
scathed. Each side scored in this pe
| riod. *
The exodus of the polqlsts to Del
Monte commences to-day. The racing
and. the polo ponies will be- â¢shipped as
rapidly as possible and all will be on
the ground by Wednesday.
Will Play Polo on Bicycles.
OAKLAND, Feb. 14. â The Oakland
Wheelmen will hold a Pacific Coast
championship bicycle polo contest at
Foresters* Hall on Thursday evening,
the 25th inst. Their opponents will be
selected at the next meeting of the
club, which now holds the champion
ship of the coast- It has been chal
lenged by several cycling clubs of San
Francisco.
The club recently elected the fol
lowing officers to serve during the en
suing year: President. A. B. Moffatt;
vice president, John Warner; record

secretary, Frank Bruzzone; captain,

England's "Ancient Lights."
Englishmen, at least the more pro
gressive among them, .are* finally
awakening to the absurdity of the old
lav,- which establishes what are known
as "ancient lights." Under this law
windows which have been in existence
for nineteen years or more cannot be
deprived of light by construction of
neighboring buildings without due
compensation having been made to the
owner. In other words, an owner of
land cannot erect a building which will
shut in any of the windows of neigh
boring buildings, providing the latter
have been in existence for nineteen
or more years, without making himself
liable to extensive damages. Moreover,
the damaged owner can prevent the
erection of any such building which will
take away his light if he wishes to do
so. The light, by virtue of the time he
has enjoyed it, has become a part of
his property. Efforts are now being
made to have this relic of past ages
repealed. It is this more than anything
else that has prevented. the erection of.
high buildings in London.â Exchange.
Senator Aldrich as a. Golfer.
Senator Aldrich is one of the athletic
figures of the national Senate. He Is
always trained down to fighting
weight; his step is as elastic as a
boy's, his bearing that of a muscular
man. '\ '\'
The secret is said to be in his devo
tion to the ancient game of golf. Near
his residence in Providence he pos
sesses expansive acres, on which is his
own private links. Many a morning
during the long summer and autumn
months finds him bright and early
whacking the elusive ball and chasing
It up hill and down dale.
It is claimed that the Senator is the

BARGE SCORES
OVER TILLIE R
Kims in Great Form in Every
Course and Easily Beats His
Opponent in Deciding Round
MANY EXCITING CHASES
Sacramento Hounds Carry Off
the Honors at Union Park
by Running 1 One, Two, Three
The highly bred little Sacramento
greyhound, Barge, was the star per
former yesterday at Union Coursing
Park. From the first course he was
in the going every minute of the time.
None of the other dogs seemed to
have a chance when Barge was there
and, he carried away the honors in the
deciding course against Tillie R with
out turning a hair.
All day long the dogs were running
well. The performers from Sacra
mento were there exceedingly strong
and landed one, two, three in the final
wind-up. Tillie R was second to Barge
and next in line came Pocatelli, also
from the Capital City. '
Barge was a 1 to 5 choice over Tillie
R when they were slipped in the final
event of the day. As soon as the dogs
started in their little chase around the
lot the greenest man inside the gates
of the park could see the odds were
justifiable. Barge took the first turn
and the next and so he kept on till
he killed the hare and scored in all 24
points against Tillie R's 3.
Free From Flaw and Vina ran three
undecided courses in the first round.
All of the trials were hot ones
and the spectators kept cheering the
game hounds on. Finally Vina won
out by a narrow margin. This same
trick was repeated in the same round
by Fenii and Cubanola. Fenii stood
the pace in better form and finally
got away with the course after the
third trial. Following are the day's

Bacteria Made Merry.
There was great chuckling and much
nudging of each other in. the ribs
among the bacteria whose habitat is
the Park Row terminal of the Brook
lyn bridge when they read the address
to the public by the advisory board to
the Health Commissioner having to do
with pneumonia and the causes lead
ing up to the same. In this address
the board set forth' the following,
among other things:
"The bacteria germs which are the
immediate excitants of pneumonia are
usually conveyed in the dust of air.
Feather dusters should be abandoned
and moist cloths used for dusting.
When practicable sweeping should be
done in the evening, so that floating
dust may completely settle before its
removal by moist cloths in the morn
ing."
It was this which brought ear-to-ear
grins to the droll visages of the Brook
lyn bridge bacilli yesterday. Bacillus
Tuberculosis, roosting under the main
stairway, had been reading it to his
bosom pal, Diplococcus Pneumoniae.
"Dippy, old man," he said, jocularly,
turning to his chum, "the moist cloth'll
get you if you don't watch out."
Laying a finger against his nose and
winking his port eye expressively, Dip
lococcus Pneumonlae.flew off to Join a
small group of about 90,000,000 of his
fellows who were starting over to
Brooklyn on the back of a motorman's
neck.
The amusement of the bacteria over
the advisory board's address to the
public was hjorn of the fact that moist
cloths are not used to dust the bridge
terminal, albeit the sweeping and the
cleaning of it is done in the daytime.
And they knew that the terminus was
one of the most popular hangouts In
town, with bacteria of all kinds and
varieties.â Exchange.
The Only One of the Kind.
The woman entered the ticket office.
"I want a ticket to Pittsburg on the
Limited," $he said.
The clerk looked doubtful.
"Don't you want to know how much
It costs?" he asked.
"I've seen your advertised rate," she
said. y
"But of course you expect to get a
discount of some sort?"
"No."
"Well, surely you want to know how
much you'd save by going on another
train V
"No. The Limited suits me."
"Or perhaps you'd like to have me
explain why excursion tickets are not
good on that train?"
"Don't you want to know if the rate
Is likely to go down 50 cents if you wait
over until to-morrow?"
"No." .
"Or why it's higher than it was last
summer?" . v â 
"No." '.'â :â 
"Or if you can stop ' over for two
weeks somewhere to visit your Aunt
Samantha?" \
"NO.". .Vl'^.jy
The clerk leaped over the counter. 3
"Pardon me, madam," he said, "but
are you married?"
"Yes."
"It's too bad," he slshed. "but I
might have known such a prize would
not be unclaimed. I haven't seen-an

ties have prevented the use of "spot
lights" In Sir Henry Irving's production
of "The Bells," and have compelled the
stage management to use instead In the
dream scene a strong incandescent
light. This action, In connection with
other safeguards which have been
placed about Chicago theater audiences
since the Iroquois disaster, has caused
no little annoyance to the English
actor, who expressed his displeasure
when called before an audience at the
close of his performance in the Illinois
Theater. In the course of his remarks
Sir Henry said;
"I trust that you will not misunder
stand me if I refer to the recent fearful,
lamentable disaster which occurred
hereâ the disaster which was the result
of panic. Panics are always terrible,
and the disasters they produce are al
ways terrible. That which occurred
casts no reflections on your city or on
the theaters in your city, for It could
have occurred in any other city in the
world, and in a cathedral, in a church
or in a railway station just as easily
as In the theater.
"But it has produced a panicâ a nanic
among your officials. And I would like
it to be thoroughly understood by you
that sometimes much injustice may be
done by jacks in office. And I would
earnestly beg, of you to exert all youf
influence to allay the feeling of panic
which at present exists among officials
of your city.".

ing, Iteferee Logan Awards
Game to San Francisco Men
VAMPIRES BEAT HORNETS
Eight Disgruntled Oaklanders
Are Easy Victims of Crack
Eleven From Alameda County
Yesterday proved an unsatisfactory
one for .the lovers of association foot
ball. So many of the players thought
the ground at Idora Park would be too
wet for play that they failed to put In
an appearnce.
The match between the Thistle and
Pickwick teams fpr the championship^
of the California league was not played,
being forfeited to the Thistles, who had
their full team on the ground, while
only one member of the Pickwick elev
en was on hand. At 1 p. m., the time
set for beginning play, the Thistle team
went into the field,, in the center of
which the ball was" placed, kicked it
down and into the net, scoring a goal.
Norman Logan, the referee, awarded
the match to the Thistles, whd scored
two" points.
At 3 p. m. the match between the
Oakland Hornets and the Vampires be
gan. The Vampires had a full team,
but the Hornets began with only seven
players, one more joining them later.
The Hornets seemed much disgruntled
and played a rough, quarrelsome game,
in which they were encouraged by in
judicious supporters on the side lines.
Referee C. W. Irish awarded three or
four free kicks within the penalty area
to the" Vampires and many free kicks
in the field.
In the first few minutes of play Kay
kicked a goal for the Vampires, and
soon afterward Petersen scored a goal
from a penalty kick. A second penalty
kick awarded to the Vampires was
taken by Petersen, but went to one side
of the goal. In the second half the
Vampires scored two more goals, one
being from a penalty kick. During this
period Shand, the center forward of the
Hornets, was ruled off the field by the
referee for refusal to comply with in
structions.
The Vampires were represented by a
new man as goalkeeper: Petersen, cap
tain and left back; Theberge, right
back; Harwood, left halfback; Turner,
center halfback; Glarner, right half
back; Lees, outside left forward; Kay,
inside left forward; "Wilding, center
â¢forward; Showell, Inside right, and
Buchly, outside right.
The following players wore the black
and orange jersey of the Hornets: Pom
eroy, goalkeeper: McKenzie, fullback;
Bird and Chambers, halfbacks; Pod
more, Morrison, Shand and Cowell, for
wards.
The ground, though soft, was in fair
condition at the opening of the game,
but a light rain which fell during the
play rendered the grass slippery and
falls were frequent. - â¢
In the morning there was to have
been a match on the ground at Webster
street, Alameda, between the hospital
corps "and the second eleven of the
Vampires, but on account of the ab
sence of the latter it did not take place.
The members of the hospital corps and
some players picked up on the ground
took part in a practice game.
Labouchcrc on Wilhclm I. R.
There Is an individuality about him
that attracts. He seeks to excel in
every art, and his lively genius enables
him to become, if not a master, at least
a creditable proficient in almost all.
Whether he really believes In his right
divine to rule Is perhaps doubtful, but
most undoubtedly he Is an able ruler,
though he is sometimes a little indis
creet in his language and lays down
the law before he has fully thought the
subject out. Generally speaking, how
ever, he takes a broad, statesmanlike
view of things, and he has done much
to galvanize the dormant energies of
his countrymen in trade and manufac
ture and to make his empire a great
workshop.
We blame him for insisting upon a
strong navy. But were we Germans
I do not think that we should ques
tion that this is almost a necessity if
Germany is to become what she aims
to be. So, too, In regard to the army.
Germany has no natural frontiers. She
is surrounded by powers that, were
they to combine, would probably crush
her. She knows that sne holds Als'ace
and Lorraine by the sword, and that,
however peaceful a French ruler may
be, France would strike for her lost
territory were Germany engaged in a
serious contest with any of her other
neighbors. The mistaken policy of an
nexing these provinces, for which the
present Emperor was not responsible,
imposes on him the necessity of a
strong and effective army.
The difficulties of Germany are great.,
and the Emperor has always seemed
to me to have shown considerable abil
ity In meeting them.â London Truth.
Dead Letter Oftlc- Sale.
In London a short time ago a sale
was held of a* quantity of miscellaneous
property from the returned letter officel
It formed eighty-eight lots, of a va
riety sufficient to stock a universal
provider in a large way of business.
Literature, music, clothing, millinery,
Imitation jewelry, cigars and tobacco,
wines, spirits and mineral waters, gro
ceries, confectionery, boots, umbrellas,
table cutlery â¢ comprised the main
classes of goods for sale. Other Items
defied classification, such as four boxes
containing a" quantity of patent foods,
etc.," which realized 8 shillings. In
these boxes were samples of every
medical food and every patent medicine
known to. man. ,? /
Most of the clothing went at an
average of less than 1 shilling a gar
ment, for much of it was second-hand.
Some prices were startling. Enough
confectionery to start a small shop
went for a few shillings; 147 hats, caps
and bonnets realized 13 shillings; 40
men's white and colored shirts made
Â£1. A curious lot, consisting of a hunt-
Ing coat, a tunic, a cape, a pair of
breeches, two naval Jerseys, six white
drill Jackets and three pairs of white
drill trousers fetched 11 shillings.
There was one pathetic lot, a bottle
of Irish whisky, the label of which
wished "A Happy- Christmas" to the
man it never reached.â Dublin News. :

part of the city, where they have put
up ten targets â five for rifle practice

pistol practice will be held at
20 yards at the standard Ameri
can reduced target. The first
prize contest will be held i Thurs

At the high jinks of the Shell Mound
Pistol and Rifle Club held at Shell
Mound Park the members of the or
ganization presented Captain L. Slebe
with a diamond locket in honor of his
twenty-fifth anniversary as proprietor

Considerable enthusiasm is manifest
among the University of California
cadets in regard to rifle practice. They
have already issued three challenges to
companies interested in target matters
and intend to spend considerable time
at the range to perfect themselves for
the contests. The scores recently made
by tbe cadets would be an honor to
older and more experienced marksmen.

BERKELEY, Feb. 14.â Delegates
from the four clubs- of the Women's
Basket-ball League, meeting yesterday
in Hearst Hall, arranged the schedule
of games for the coming season. Ac
cording to this schedule the University
of Nevada will meet the San Jose Nor

by the league.
The delegates were Miss Potter-
Gardner of Mills, Miss Downle of Stan
ford, Miss Cameron of Nevada, Miss
Talcott of California. . San Jose was
not represented.
At least this may be said of the man
who committed suicide: He had h la
own way and doesn't look any happier
for it.
RAIN SPOILS
TENNIS PLAY
Experts Find Opportunities Be
tween Showers for Inter
esting Tournament Matches
MACGAVIN IN THE LEAD
Is Outpointing: George Baker
on the Park Courts When
Competition Is Stopped
The wet weather yesterday Interfered
seriously with the plans of the tennis
players. The Golden Gate Park en
thusiasts enjoyed a few matches be
tween showers, but the tournament
was not nearly completed. In the
first class only two matches were
finished, a third being stopped in the
second set.
Thrs contestants in the latter were
Drummond MacGavin and George
Baker, two of the best men in the class.
The first set was a close and a prettily
played one. MacGavin played a reck
less game and took chances, while
Baker got the balls *back- The Cali
fornia Club man took the set and led
at 4-3 in the second, when the rain In
terfered.
In the other matches Carl Gardner
beat James Code and Crarence Griffin
disposed of George Bates. Code made
a much better showing than was ex
pected against Gardner. The veteran
took the second set and made his
younger opponent extend himself to
win. Bates was no match for Griffin.
The latter won two straight sets.
In the fourth class ten of the thirty
two players entered were weeded out.
Of the ten matches played only one re
quired three sets. The only match that
was at all close was that between Dr.
Lovegrove and D. Darns. The doctor's
daily practice put him in good shape
and enabled him to pull through. The
first two sets were closjÂ», but Lovegrov*
wen the third easily.
The following matches were played in
the fourth class:
J. K. Turner beat E. G. BlgiÂ»low. 8-2. Â«-2:
G. Hall beat A. Joseph. 6-4. 6-O; M. Martin
beat C. Quick, 6-2. 6-1; T. Allan beat. E.
Price. 6-1, 6-2; Dr. LovÂ«rro<ve b**t D. DarnÂ«.

M. Long beat W. Wilson. 6-0. 7-3; H. Gets
beat M. Little, 6-1, o-3; M. Howell beat II.
Miller, 7-5. 6-4.
On account of the big tournaments to
be played at Oakland on the 21st and
22d inst. the Golden Gate Club has post
poned play in the first, second and
third classes to the 2Sth. The fourth
class, however, will be completed next
Sunday. Most of the cracks from the
park will compete at Oakland, and* are
also desirous of playing in the first
class.
The suggestion from across the bay
to hold a bay counties championship In
singles and doubles is a good one. but
could not be accomplished until all tho
clubs on both sides of the bay. Join the
Pacific States Lawn Tennis Association.
The California and Golden Gate clubs
on this side of tho bay are members,
but several of the Alameda County
clubs are not. When all are in the as
sociation it will be an easy matter for
them to arrange for cups emblematic
of the championships. An annual event
of this kind would meet with the ap
proval of the tennis enthusiasts on
bcth sides of the bay.
On the California Club courts yester
day many of the experts were out, but
most of the matches were either short
or unfinished. The showery weather
made it impossible to play for any
length of time.
In singles Frank Stringham won a
close set from Frank Mitchell. A. W.
Worthington played a fine game when
he won the first set from Stringham.
The latter won the next three. Pro
fessor Crawford beat Ray Cornell eas
ily.
In doubles Grant Smith and Harry
Rolfe won the first set from Frank
Mitchell and Chet Smith. The" score In
the second set was also in their favor,
being 2â0.
Gus Lisser showed great' Improve
ment in his matches with Charles
Kuehn and Cornell. He almost won a
set from the latter. Scores:
E Robblna tied G. Lisser, 6-4. 1-9: T.
Strlnsham beat F. S. Mitchell. 8-6; String
ham beat A. W. Worthingtcn, 1-6. 6-4, 6-3. 6-2:

INDEPENDENTS WIN FROM
ROVTiR FOOTBALL TEAM
Eddie Fay of Victorious Club Slakes
Two Spectacular Scores Toward
Close of Game.
At the Presidio Athletic grounds thÂ«
Independents defeated the Albion Rov
ers yesterday afternoon, after an ex
citing game of association football, by
the score of 9 to 0.
Owing to the rain there were but few
enthusiasts in the grand stand, but the
few who did venture out did their ut
most toward making the affair a suc
cess from a rooter's standpoint.. When
in the beginning of the second half of
the game the score stood 5 to 0 in favor
of the Independents, a mlgnty cry went
up from the side lines to "make it awf
a dozen" and "'it 'im good old chap"
until at the close of the game the In
dependents were six in the lead.
The game throughout was poorly
played and the winning team won out
in a very slipshod manner;
Eddie Fay, who made two of the
points, was the feature of the game.
The Independent team will play for
the Coast medal on the Oakland
grounds next Saturday.

SWISS KILLED
BY MILL HAND
Pierce Lagler, a Tanner, Is
Struck by Harry Waidelich
and His Skull Is Fractured
DEBAUCH ENDS IN DEATH
Assailant Is Booked at City
Prison for Murder, but Says
the Killing Was Accidental
Pierce Lagler, a Swiss tanner resid
ing at the San Bruno Hotel, San
Bruno avenue and Army street, was
fatally injured Saturday night by be
ing struck and knocked down by
Harry Waidelich. a millhand. I^agler
died yesterday morning at the City
and County Hospital.
The unfortunate Swiss was in an in
toxlc_ted condition in a saloon at the
corner of Twenty-fourth street and
Potrero avenue Saturday night.
Waidelich and Charles S. Scroff. who
lives at 2S65 Twenty-second street, en
tered the saloon to got a drink before
going to the masquerade ball given
that night at Mannerbur.d Hall by the
Ped Men. Lasler was In the saloon
and when he saw Waidelich and
Ecroff enter in the coFtumes of a
tegro and a negro wench, he was very
much impressed by their appearance.
Waidelich rarried an aecordeon, and
the Swiss thought that he should like
to hear a little music. He asked
WaJdelieh to play for him. but the
uegro impersonator refused. Lagler
became enraged at the refusal and
told Waidelich that he would take the
Instrument away from him.
When the two men left the saloon
to go to the ball they were followed
by Lagler. Waidelich claims that Lag
ler grabbed his arm and attempted to
xrrest the aceordeon from him. "I hit
him across the face with my open
hand." said Waidelich, "and he fell to
the sidewalk. I had no intention of
hurting him. but when he tried to take
the instrument from me I had to pro
tect myself. Scroff and myself left
him lying on the sidewalk and went
Into the hall to attend the ball. I was
trrested there later."
After the Swiss had been felled to
the sidewalk a crowd gathered and
the Seventeenth-street police station
was notified. The injured man was
removed to the City and County Hos
pital near by and was found to have
sustained a fracture of the skull. He
never regained consciousness and died

MORGAN'S NEPHEW ARRIVES
WITH HIS JAPANESE BRIDE
Relative of Finance King a Passenger on the Steamship China.
Purchases an Oriental Wife From Her Parents at a Fabulous
Price and Will Take Her to Reside With Him in New .York City
George D. Morgan and his young
Japanese bride were among the pas
sengers on the steamship China ar
riving from the Orient yesterday.
Morgan is a nephew of J. Pierpont
Morgan, the noted New York finan
cier. He has been sojourning in Japan
for the last three years, and while there
fell desperately in love with a beauti
ful geisha girl and just prior to the
departure of the China for this port
he married her in Kioto. It is reported
that before her parents would give
sanction to the marriage, Morgan was
obliged to pay them 15,000 yen.
Mrs. Morgan is a most attractive
young woman. She is slightly above
the average Japanese woman's height,
of graceful carriage, pretty face and
beautiful dark luminous eyes. She was
attired in Japanese costume even to the
wicker sandals. Her hair is dressed in
simple fashion, almost after the mode
now in vogue here. When she came on
board the steamship at Yokohama she
could hardly speak a word of English,
but now she is able to give utterance
to practically all the ordinary re
marks of the day. She has a very soft,
musical voice, to which 5s added a
charming and gracious manner.
How New York will receive this
beauty from the Orient is a question
to be solved. That she is immensely
attractive no one can deny, and it
would not be at all surprising if she
became a feted pet of society.
HOPE TO REGAIN
THEIR JEWELRY
Sporting: Men Who Were Rob
bed at the Colonial Club Give
Case to Private Detectives
The victims have eliminated the reg
ular police as possible factors in the
apprehension of the five criminals who
robbed the players and spectators In
the Colonial Club early Saturday morn
ing. Yesterday the sleuths of a local
private detective agency were put on
the case by the men who suffered the
loss of so much money and jewelry in
the robbery.
It is stated on good authority that the
Pinkerton Agency has the case in hand
and is working for a quiet settlement
between the robbers and the robbed.
Yesterday th-3 Pinkerton "sherlocks"
had two race track men, "King" Had
ley, and a tout known in the tender
loin as "Doc Blue Mass," in the sweat
box. "King" and "Doc," whose repu
tations are not of the best around the
city, are supposed to know the identity
of the crooks. Just -what the detect
ives learned from the two men Is not
known, but it is alleged that the latter
gave the sleuths a sufficient clew to the
perpetrators of the robbery to result
in the arrest of the gang.
HEATH IS QUESTIONED.
""King" Hadley is the bookmaker who
was ruled from the Oakland track two
months ago for alleged complicity with
the bookmakers and Jockeys concerned
in the recent scandal, by which fre
quenters of the races were robbed on
their bets. * â¢â¢,? .
Last night C. Heath, the one man
who was in the Colonial Club at the
time of the robbery who was ; not di
vested of his wealth, was conveyed to
the sweat box and retained under a
fire of questions for more, than two
hours. It has always been alleged
that Heath was well acquainted with
th*> robbers, and that when they recog
nized him Friday night, they passed
him for a "dead one." '
The placing of the case in the hands
of a private detective agency again
shows the desire of the . sporting men
to hush the matter and regain their
money and jewelry without giving pub
licity to the case.
POLICE FIXD NO CLEW. '
The local police never found a single
clew, and received practically no assist
ance from the ' men who were robbed.
The keepers of the club know the cul
prits and claimed to have given the po
lice the clew, while In reality it was
given to a private detective concern.
The private detectives and the club
men hope to have the matter all hushed
and Gquared In a few days. None of
the robbers have left town, and all of
thÂ«* suspicious characters of - the turf
are under surveillance. . The local po
lice i-llege that the deed was done by
men who were habitues of . the place
and familiar with the whereabouts of
the bank roll. They say that the men

Residents of Valencia and Twenty-
Fifth Streets.
Considerable excitement was caused
yesterday afternoon at the junction of
Valencia and Twenty-fifth streets by
the explosion of a signal torpedo placed
on the Southern Pacific ty-ack for the
purpose of calling the 4 o'clock freight
to a halt.
As the residents of Valencia street
are not accustomed to hearing trains
signaled in this manner it was thought
at first . that an attempt was being
made to wreck the train, and it was
not long before a large crowd was at
tracted to the scene.
When the necessary orders had been
given and the cars had once more start-)
ed rolling on the way southward the
crowd finally realized that no serious
damage had been done, and with the
exception of a few small boys dis
persed, leaving the neighborhood in its
usual peaceful appearance.

Mrs. Jennie Daly, a young woman re

seated on a handsome steamer chair,
playing with a beautiful fox terrier
which she called Skaes. Finding that
she was becoming the cynosure of all
eyes, she repaired to the dining hall
with her husband.
Morgan, who is a pleasant, affable
man of probably 30 years, said he had
lived for atfout three years in the
Orient, where he had met and married
his bride. He seemed much annoyed at
the attempts to take snapshots, and
said that he was forced to seek the se
clusion of the cabin on that account.
On arrival here the couple immediate
ly went to the Palace, where they took
dinner in the main dining hall. The
bride was magnificently robed in dark
brown silk, with a white scarf about
her neck, while her fingers were cov
ered with superb jewels. After dinner
Mr. and Mrs. Morgan drove to Trinity
Church to call on the Rev. Dr. Clam
pett. This morning at 10 o'clock they
will depart for New York.
Morgan seems devoted to his bride,
and when he left the dining hall last
night he fondly led her out by the hand.
MAKES CHARGES
OF DECEPTION
Rev. William, Racier Describes
Russia's Scheming to Defeat
America on Vital Occasions
"Four Reasons "Why America Should
Sympathize With Japan" was one of
the subjects treated. by the Rev. Wil
liam Rader at the Third Congregation-:
al. Church, Fifteenth and Mission
streets, last night. -The church was
crowded , and the remarks of the Rev.
Mr. Rader were listened to with in
tense interest. The speaker said in
part:
There are four reasons why America should,
in my opinion,' sympathize with Japan. First,
because of our religious, commercial and edu
cational investments in Japan. In 1852 Com
modore Perry awoke -Japan by ringing her
door bells - with a cannon-ball, since which
time we have exchanged investments. Second,
because of Japan's rights In Manchuria and
Korea. America agrees with Japan that the
door . of Manchuria should- be open and we
should not permit .the .Czar -to put the key
in his pocket. Nine-tenths of. the Korean pos
seaelons belong to Japan and Russia is not
in a uosltion to say ' what ' she may or may
not do. â¢ â¢ â¢
Japan is fighting for her existence, while
the Russian bear is licking his hungry chops
for Manchuria, Korea, China and Japan.
The third reason for our sympathy is that
Japan Â«tandÂ» for better civilization than Rus
sia, which has always opposed democracy and
practiced conquest and absorption.
Fourth, Russia has not been a friend of the
United States. It must not be forgotten that
Catherine II In IT7S offered Great Britain an
army of Cossacks to shoot the men of America
who rang the Independence bell.
In 1808 Russia showed her sympathy for
Spain, with which she was in secret negotia
tions to fight against the United States. The
facts of tins secret compact are to this day to
be found in the Spanish Red Book and Is
therefore a fact of history.
Lord Salisbury, knowing Russia's attitude
against the United â  States at the very time
the Czar was calling for an international peace
conference, had English battleships ready,
and In reply, to a question why England had
made that move Lord Salisbury said. that if
any of the European powers should act
against the United States every battleship
under the union Jack would be: at the service
of the American people.
That is the record of â¢ the spirit - Russia has
shown during the two crises in American his
tory. ..- -. â  .â¢",-

"THE DEVIL'S AUCTION"
Twenty-Third Annual .Edition
of Famous Extravaganza De
lights Big Crowd at California
Eight pretty young women, attired
in slate-colored college robes and natty
"mortarboards,"- have headline distinc
tion this week at the Orpheum. and
they sing and play various musical in
struments in a way that entitles them
to the honor. They are billed as "The
Vassar Girls," and as long as they
wear the seminary costume their work
Is refined enough to preserve the at
mosphere created by their appearance.
After four of them have played wooden
wind instruments, six of them blow
delicious melody through saxaphones
and eight of them â four cornets and
four trombonesâ make brazen music
galore. Then they lose their collegiate
identity and appear as an "electric
ballet," an act which is beautiful, but
lacking novelty. The girls, fairly cov
ered with vari-colored incandescent
bulbs, perform a maypole dance, the
finale of which has the stage aglare
with brilliance.-
Another strong act is programmed
as "The Werner-Amoros Troupe," and
consists of a scene in an artist's
studio, in which three men and two
women make a whole lot of fun
through the medium of ingeniously
contrived mechanical effects. One of
the men juggles nine balls and breaks
the record for that sort of thing. The
finish of the act might be aptly termed
a "rough house," for all the furniture of
the studio is wrecked and piled upon
the staee.
Harry Thomson, announced as, "The
Mayor of the Bowery," gives some
clever imitations of familiar character
types. His various dialects are faith
ful enough to keep the house in a roar.
Ziska and King appear in an act
with the self-explanatory title of "The
Magician and His Valet," and do some
good comedy work. John T. Thorne
and Grace Carleton open a big budget
of new jokes, some of which are
rather laboriously worked up to, but all
have the desired laughter-making ef
fect. Thorne and Carleton evidently
studied the taste of their patrons and
constructed accordingly, for mental
effort is not severely taxed to grasp
the point of their Jests.
Among the holdovers are Snyder and
Buckley, whose musical sketch can be
seen more than once without los
ing charm. Thirsty Blatz is as funny
as any German comedian- in San Fran
cisco, and that is saying something
worthy of note at this particular time.
Rice and Elmer continue their clever
horizontal bar stunts and dull comedy
work. Van, Beaumont & Co. are* also
retained, and there are several new
and interesting moving pictures. The
bill as a whole is well up to the Or
pheum standard.

The "twenty-second edition" of
Charles H. Yale's "Devil's Auction"
opened at the California Theater last
night. While.it is a production old
to the theater-goers of this city, it
was, nevertheless, received by, a large
audience and afforded satisfaction.
Each act of the piece has been re
arranged and invested with new scenic
productions since it was here last,
and the specialties that comprise a
major portion of the show are for the
most i>art new.
The inferno scene in the first act
was worked out by excellent electrical
effects, as were scenes that followed,
the fantastic fog. the realms of Me
phisto, the lake of the lost souls and
the frozen path. In the second act
Miss Madolyn Marshal, as a country
girl, scored a hit and George Herman,
as Chaos, an imp of darkness, proved
to be one of the best contortionists
seen here for some time. The golden
garden, a Chinese scene, followed, and
the acrobatic work on the part of the
four Salamonskys I entertained for
about ten minutes. The dances of the
fair attendants of the grand mandarin
were spectacular and well executed.
The five-family Orni. well known
in vaudeville circles, posed in "The
Interrupted Supper" in the last act
and were loudly applauded in their
juggling stunts. This act closed with
several gorgeous scenes. Among the
leading in the cast are W. H. Lorelle
and James B. Mackie, who are good
comedians. Carlos, a poor shepherd,
is done by- Miss Mai Estelle, and
Madeline is impersonated by Miss Amy
Mortlner. Henry P. Thomas, as
Mephisto, and Miss Alice Stoddard,
as Crystalline, are strong in the cast.

Son of Late St. Louis Millionaire Ar

After Father's Death. - '
Louis Lemp, a son of the late Wil- '
Ham J. Lemp, the millionaire brewer of i
St. Louis, who committed suicide on j
Saturday, j arrived from the Orient on
the liner China . yesterday. The first j
news the young man received of his
father's death was when the steamer
passed out of quarantine and the press
representatives climbed abqard.
He was greatly shocked by the infor
mation conveyed to him, and sadly read
the telegraphic story of his father's
tragic end as published in yesterday's
Call, a copy of which was handed him.
Immediately after registering at the
Palace young Lemp engaged the ser
vices of Jules Clerfayt to secure his
transportation overland, and he will
leave for St. Louis on this morning's
train.
I He left for the Orient several months
ago. Intending to meet a young friend
in " Japan, with whom he purposed to
travel around the world: His intended
companion, however, failed to meet him
there, and Lemp concluded to abandon
his trip and . he started home on the
China, little dreaming that his long
ocean voyage would end in bereavement
here.
