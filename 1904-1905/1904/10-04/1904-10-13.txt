SAN FRANCISCO, THURSDAY, OCTOBER 13, 1904:
PRICE FIVE CEXTS.
General; Kuropatkin's ad
vance has been met with a
counter advance of the forces
under Tield Marshal Oyama.
According . to advices re
ceived at Tokio, a general
engagement is in progress
between Liaoyang and Muk
den, but reports from Rus
sian sources describe the
fighting there as merely in
the nature of advance guard
actions. General Kuropat
kin is reported to be aiming
to strike simultaneously at
two widely separated points
on the Japanese left.
There. has been hard fight
ing a short distance north of
Bensihu, in which a Eussian
loss of 150 killed or wounded
is admitted. The Japanese
say they have cut off a Rus
sian column south of the
Taitse River*. Xo official re-
ports from the front were re
ceived .at the Russian War
Office last night, and the fact
is regarded in. some quarters
as indicating the non-snecess
thus far of General Kuropat
kin's forward movement.

ever, point ont that owing to
the magnitude of the move

to expect news of decisive

ST. PETERSBURG, Oct. 13, 3:20 a. m.
No official news of the result of to-day's
battle- south of Mukden is available at
this hour. General Kuropatkin doubt
less has communicated his regular re
port to Emperor Nicholas, but the dis
patch was not sent back to the general
Btaff to-night. So the latest word from
Russian sources is contained in the
press dispatch from Mukden. As "3
natural, the absence of official news Is
pessimistically interpreted In many
quarters, but the general staff, though
reticent, counsels patience, pointing out
that the offensive movement was
planned on a large scale, and has not
yet reached a stage where a decisive
result could have been attained.
The frontal attack, on the Yental
mines developed a -â¢ desperate battle,
in". which probably 100,000 men are : en
gaged, but, though the dispatches so
far deal -almost exclusively with this
feature of the battle. It is pointed out

General Weston eays the problem of
feeding the army In the Philippines
was a very difficult one, but "It /^j.
General Weston says that it is diffi
cult and often impossible to prevent
losses of perishable stores. Losses are
due principally, to long and difficult
water and inland transportation and
to trying climatic conditions. The
rapid abandonment of posts also re
sulted in large losses, particularly in
the Philippines.
, General Weston urgently recom
mends the passage of a bill by Congress
to give authority to all officers intrust
ed with the disbursement of subsist
ence funds to hold restricted amounts
of such funds In their personal pos
session. He says the exigencies -of the
public service require an open disre
gard of the restrictions of the exist
ing law In cities where the treasurer
or an assistant treasurer Is located.
He urges legislation authorizing the
sale at public auction of accumulated
subsistence stores in good condition,
which cannot advantageously be trans
ported to other points for. issue or sale
to troops. .;"."*
WASHINGTON, Oct. 12.â The an
nual report of Brigadier General J. F.
Weston. commissary general of the
army, says the total cost of feeding the
army during the past fiscal year was
$8,521,750. During the year the losses
were $415,650 in the Philippines, $7467
on the transports and $129,853 in the
United States, Alaska, Porto Rico and
elsewhere. From the total amount of
losses is to be deducted $85,9S0, the pro
ceeds of sales at auctions of damaged
and deteriorated stores.

at Shaktlntaidze is unknown, but th?
appearance to-night of a Russian col
umn at Tzyanchan, thirty miles south
east, striking at Field Marshal Oyama's
communications with the Yalu. and the
knowledge that another column is al
ready across the Taitse River, gives
evidence of the wide nature of thÂ«
turning movement. It is possible that
the attack on the Yental mines may
simply be Intended to hold the main
Japanese force stationary, and that the
outcome of the Yental fight may have
little bearing on the result of the gen
eral engagement.
While it is now asserted that Gen
eral Kuropatkin enjoys a considerable
numerical superior force, the main fear
expressed Is that this superiority is in
sufficient to enable him to carry oat
the big operations he has undertaken.
Apprehension Is caused by the Tokto
dispatch saying that Ffeld Marshal
Oyama reports that he Is gaining
ground and has cat off a Russian col
umn below the Taitse River. It la only

already suffered, that Russian* fully

TOKIO, Oct. 12, 8 p. m. â Reports dis
patched last night from the scene, of
the great battle now raging along an
extended front from a central point
north of Tentai, westward across the
railroad southeast to Benslhu, on the
Taitse River, say that the struggle
continued undecdsively throughout the
day. The Japanese commander's
avowed purpose was to continue the
assault throughout the night and the
following day. The Russians have a
great force down close to the Taitse
River.
Apparently Field Marshal Oyama's
attack was nicely timed to interrupt a
strong turning movement that was
threatening Liaoyang itself. The right
army, reporting last night, says:
"The enemy's artillery opened a se
vere attack at 10 o'clock Tuesday
against our forces at Bensihu. The
enemy with one regiment from his right
and five battalions from his center as
sumed the aggressive. Fighting is now
progressing. " He is bombarding be
tween Ta pass and Benslhu. In the di
rection of Tumentzu pass another ar
tillery duel is progressing. Our de
tachment, sent to the left bank of the
Taitse River, returned after driving the
enemy back. The enemy has some guns
near Tayupo, on an upper stream of
the Tnltse River. The enemy is hold
ing a line from Tumentzu pass to Ben"
sihtt, and east of the roadway he has
eighty guns and fully two divisions of
Infantry. The enemy opposing the
main strength of the right army and
holding a line from Sanchiatzu to Pa
ciatzu numbers four divisions. The
right column of the right wing and the
left column continued severe, fighting
until sundown. The left wing of the
left column, co-operating with the right
column and the center army, tried to
attack the enemy, poctrd at Sanchi
atzu, bin was unable to effect this pur
pose before sundown, but the progress
of the front center and left wing is
very favorable. The commander of the
army was still keeping up the attack
on the enemy even after dark."
The center army reports that its
right column.' which has been occupy
ing the heights- north of Yuamentzu
since yesterday, is co-operating with
the left column of the right army and
began advancing toward Ouchiatzu,
which place it attacked. In themean
while the left wing advanced and at
tacked Wanoniutum . and Samkwal
shlshan. The result of the â¢ attack In
those directions' is unknown. The
enemy opposing the left column holds
a line from Fanchlatan. on the Schill
River, to Reuitaokou: and makes a
stubborn' resistance." "It was sundown."

Father Ricardo says it is likely that
the late electrical storm and general
meteorological disturbance witnessed
upon the coast were in a large meas
ure due to the formation of the sun
spots. He can give no reason for the
formation of the spots.
The larger of the spots Is a slight
distance below the sun equator, and
the two smaller ones ten degrees above
the equator. The size of the larger
spot is very great in comparison with
the earth. One of the small spots is a
double one, being composed of two
smaller ones, and, compared with the
earth, is very large. These spots this
afternoon* appeared to grow in size,
and the discoverer believes they will
further increase.
SAN JOSE. Oct. 12.â Three large
spots were discovered upon the sun
this afternoon by Father Ricardo, di
rector of the meteorological observa
tory at Santa Clara College. One of
the spots is several times larger than
the earth, and the other two are of
still greater magnitude. These spots
were discovered about 2:30 o'clock and
observed several times by the senior
class and Father Bell, who. pronounced
them true sun spots. * The observations
were made through the S-Inch equato
rial. " ' ' ~ â¢-Â¦ ."

fourteen of the largest and most pow
erful steam shovels and make a begin

order to form some basis of the cost.
If bide are then called for from con
tractors the commission can determine
the question of economy.
The President advised agaln?t build-
Ing up too heavy a clerical force or any
other Hxtravagances, and plainly Indi
cated that the commission itself would
be held responsible.
Soon after the members of the com
mission left the White House John
Barrett, United States Minister to Pan
ama, conferred with the President. The
President gave to Barrett some "get
together" advice. On coming away
Barrett made a qualified denial that
differences exist between himself and
Admiral Walker.
"When I left Panama." he sald."I had
a perfect understanding with the Pan
ama authorities and I am here now
working out the agreement I made with
them.'
The President called the commission
into conference for the purpose of find
ing out at first hand what progress
has been made in beginning the work
of construction- The question of
whether the work can be more eco
nrmically performed by contract or un
der the direction of the Government
â¢was discussed and It seemed to be the

ference lasted more than an hour. But
how to "dig," whether by contract or

the principal feature or the canal ques
tion discussed. With a view to expe
diting the work in accordance with
the President's wishes. th.e commission
favors the purchase and operation of

Believe That General Kuropatkin Is
Running, a Tremendous Risk.
â¢ LONDONTOct. 13.â The battle raging
south of Mukden has revived to the
full public interest in the war. Piece
meal reports from both sides are dis
cussed and analyzed in the fullest de
tails, in the belief that this will prove
to be the greatest engagement of the
"present campaign and the news so far
received Inclines the military experts
to the opinion that General Kuropatkin
is running a tremendous risk by his
bold initiative.
There is no confirmation of the re
port that General Mistchenko's force is
cut off and the fact that Field Marshal
Oyama's report does not mention him
is regarded as pointing to his escape.
At the same time the dispatches do not
yet point to a success on the Russian
side and the motive underlying General
Kuropatkin's decision to assume the of
fensive seems as difficult to understand
as before.

ST. PETERSBURG, Oct. 12.â The
story cabled from Shanghai to the
London Telegraph by Bennett Bur
lelgh, that Oyama will be recalled and
that General Nodzu will be made com
mander in chief of the Japanese forces,
attracts lively interest' in military cir
cles here. It is now known that Gen
eral Nodzu's action in the battle of
Liaoyang in pressing a portion of his
army across the Taitse River to co
operate with General Kuroki. thus in
creasing the strength of -the Japanese
flanking force and threatening Kuro
patkin's communications, made it im
possible for the Russian commander
to risk continuing his original plan of
striking the Japanese right, which
forced the Russian retirement.
According to a Russian general who
has just returned here from Liaoyang,
the Japanese i had 140,000 men,- six
double Â¦ divisions and four brigades,
across the river when Kuropatkin or

for the first time In tne present Far
Eastern campaign during Kuropatkin's
efforts to oyerwhelm Oyama's forces.
Hitherto the only mounted Russian
troops employed have been Cossacks.
They are best suited ! for scouting,
guerrilla fighting and courier service.
Kuropatkin has thrown them against
the enemy repeatedly since the battle
of the Yalu, but has carefully pre
served the* regular cavalry, the hus
sars, dragoons and uhlans, for the for
ward movement. '
These men are reputed to be the best
mounted, most skillful and most dar
ing horsemen in the world. Whole reg
iments ride horses of a single color, so
that units are readily distinguishable
when masses are movtng. The Rus
sian commander, in chief has 25,000 of
this cavalry at the front for immediate
active service. He recently received
800 field guns.- The general staff says
that he has in the field a force of 300,
000 men.

WASHINGTON, Oct. 12.â An infor
mal conference was held at the White
House to-day at which the -President,
Sir William E. White, R. N. (retired)
and formerly chief constructor of the
British navy; Secretary Morton, Ad
miral. Dewey, Rear Admiral Converse
and Rear Admirals Capps, Evans and
Rodgers discussed naval architecture,
with special reference to the American
navy. The conference was called by
the President, to whom Secretary Mor
ton had presented Sir William earlier in
the day, and lasted from 2:30 until 4
o'clock In the afternoon.
The President and Sir William, who
is a world-famous naval architect, had
a brief talk this morning about ships,
and the President then decided to In
vite a number of officials of the Navy
Department to meet Sir William later
in the day, when the discussion could
be continued.
Sir William was surprised at the
technical knowledge displayed by the
President regarding naval matters. The
President asked many questions about
our own navy, and the early part of
the discussion concerned the â¢ effect of
the Far Eastern war up"on naval ar
chitecture." Sir William was free to say
with fighting on the sea there had been
demonstrated beyond the <shadow of a
doubt the overwhelming superiority of
the modern formidable battleships.
Sir William, in reply to questions of
the President, gave his views of the
American navy, comparing our ; new
ships with those of France, Germany
and Great Britain. He expressed the
opinion that the battleships now build
ing in this country stood at the front
of the best types of modern battleships.
WASHINGTON. Oct 12.â The State
Department expects to dispatch to
morrow the papers relating to the seiz
ure of the mails on the Calehas to the
American embassy at St. Petersburg.
As Embassador McCormlck is now en
route to the United States the matter
will be dealt with at the embassy by
Spncer Eddy, the secretary, who will
pimply submit the papers to .the Rus
sian Foreign Office, with a request for
an explanation as to why the Russian
naval vessels have Interfered with the
operations of the universal postal union
treaty.
There is little in the way of prece
dent to guide the negotiators on either
side in this matter, whjch probably will
in the end come before The Hague
Tribunal when it is reconvened. Al
most daily some new phase of interna
tional law requiring final and accept
able construction by competent author
ity has arisen and the subject of the
right of belligerents to interfere with
malls on neutral shipping is regarded
as one of the most important. ,

Special Dispatch to The Call
TACOMA, Oct. 12.â Captain Enlund
of the Russian- ship Glenard, f which
reached port last night, fs congratulat
ing himself on his lucky escape from a
Japanese warship. The Glenard - left
San Francisco September 26 and soon
after" passing the Golden Gate the Jap
anese vessel was sighted. An. effort
was made by the Russians to keep
away from the warship, but owing to
the swiftness of the latter this was
found impossible.
The Japanese cruiser succeeded in
getting alongside the Glenard. A care
ful inspection of the Doat was made,
but there was no effort to molest, her.
Finding the ship in ballast the Japan
ese saluted the Russian and steamed
away down the coast.
Captain Enlund said to-day: "When
I saw the Japanese vessel heading to
ward the Glenard I would not have
given a dollar for my ship. "We ex
pected to be taken on board the man
of-war and carried to Japan and to see
our ship destroyed."
What reason the Japanese had In not
confiscating the Glenard Captain En
lund is â¢ unable to state. According to
International law the Japanese would
have -been justified in doing so. Cap
tain Enlund thinks that such a course
might have interfered with the plans
the Japanese had come nere to execute
and so It was deemed best to allow the
harmless ship to proceed.

HEADQUARTERS OF THE RUS
SIAN WESTERN ARMY, MUKDEN,
Oct. 1 11, VIA PEKING, pet 12.âRus
sian dragoons have captured a copy
of a message from the Emperor of
Japan to his troops in which the Mi
kado says he is still awaiting the de
cisive defeat of the Russians. . It is ap
parent from this intelligence that the
Japanese are equally prepared for im
portant events.
There have been daily engagements
between the advance guards along the
entire line of thirty miles.
The Japanese appear to be apprehen
sive of a cuttlng-off movement owing
to the fact that Russian cavalry are
south of the Taitse* River and also
owing to the presence of Russian
forces yesterday in the old positions
and fortifications at Bensihu. They
have, therefore, fallen Back.
The strong position at the Yentai
coal mines, which has been the cause
of apprehension to the Russians, was
vacated by the Japanese October 9,
though they are throwing up earth
works toward the west, where the su
periority of the Russian cavalry will
require superior defenses.
It is believed that the Japanese have
about one hundred guns at the rail
way bridge across the Taitse River,
rendering hazardous a Russian attack
there. â¢
The preliminary line of battle, after
the two armies have reinforced and
refortified for a .month past, as detei
mined by the Japanese stronghold of
the railway bridge and the Liaoyang
defenses, to-day runs southeast to
northwest from the hills opposite Ben
sihu to Yentai and thence tq Tousan T
pu, ten miles west of the railway,
where for three days the battle line
has been wavering.
,The correspondent of the Associated
Press witnessed the Russians take and
retake Tousanpu and saw. the Japan
ese burning their bridge over j the
Shake- River on their last retirement
October 9. The Japanese were rein
forced and renewed the attack October
10 withÂ» two battalions and two guns,
forcing the line back on the Russian
right, without, however, achieving any
important result.
The Japanese cannonading yesterday
was for the purpose of disclosing the
Russian position, but it was apparent
ly without result, except as showing
that the Japanese are disposed freely
to make battle within ten mils? of the
railway.
The heaviness and regularity of the
cannonading since 5 o'clock this morn
ing In the foothills and also west of the
railway indicate that greater fighting
Is in progress.
The condition of four Japanese
wounded from along the railway, who
were sent by, the Red Cross to Muk
den, and of' other prisoners taken
shows that part of the Japanese troops
are inadequately clothed for the pres
ent cold weather.
Along the battle line some of the
Chinese have built bombproof s, from
the protection of which they are gath
ering crops between the cannonadings.
Other Chinese are moving their ef
fects here and there amidst the ruth
less waste of their grain and other
property by the contending armies, j

where his skirmishers had already en
gaged the Japanese'. An artillery duel
then opened on the left with the 'Jap
anese mountain guns, brought up from
Chowsan Pass, which were shelling the
Russian scouting detachments.
The Japanese projectiles, however,
fell wide and the Russian guns came up
at a gallop, unlimbered and opened fire
on the Japanese artillery. This duel
was continued until dark. The- Rus
sian fire was accurate and eventually
silenced the Japanese battery.
Bentsiaputze), Monday, Oct. 10.â With
the Russian left flanking column (be
lieved* to be General Mistchenko's) by
way of Mukden, Oct. 12. â The Russians
have been advancing in force for sev
eral days. Upon reaching TaJdiamowze,
a mile south of Kacutou Pass on the
Funshun-Bensihu road, they began
hearing sporadic artillery flre on their
right, where the Russian advance was
in contact with the Japanese. The
movement of the main column was Im
mediately accelerated. The Russians
were then two days' march from Shin
pintaidze.
Desultory skirmishing was constant
ly proceeding on the right and left
and the Japanese steadily retired.
The firing ahead became heavier yes
terday and , wounded men from the
scouting detachments Oegan to pass
through the Russian lines.. The Rus
sians pressed forward with increased
speed, the infantry advancing at the
double. The spirits of the* men were
high, due to the fact that they were
actually assuming the offensive. They
arrived at the village or Shanplntaidze
at 6 % o'clock this morning. The Japan
ese had hurriedly abandoned the place
the night before, paying the Chinese
big prices to carry away their stores,
amounting to 4000 bags of rice and
barley.
There were two divisions of Japanese
in front of the Russians. The general
commanding: this (Russian) column,
upon reaching Shanpintaldze, deployed
a portion of his forces, with a battery
of artillery, sent out left-flank supports
and went personally to his right flank.
KOUTAILSZE (fix and a half miles
north of Bensihu), Oct. 12.â A Russian
correspondent telegraphs as follows:
"I have been with General Kashta
linsky's column since October 8. We
have been pushing south from Fushun
and have had a number of skirmishes
and one hot fight at the village of Kho
dyagoy on October 9, in which he lost
150 killed or wounded. We are now
approaching the banks of the Taltse
River. The Japanese, who had already
been driven out of Bentslaputze when
we arrived, are now retiring from Lul
ehudia, only two miles ahead. Our ad
vance is falling back on Bensihu.
"General Rennenkampff's Cossacks
first attacked Khodyagoy, driving the
Japanese from the village with a loss
of twelve killed or wounded/ The Jap
anese then took a stand on a ridge to
the southward, whence It seemed it
would be impossible to dislodge them.
Two of their guns replied persistently
to ours, although late in the afternoon
they ceased firing, apparently to save
ammunition. The East Siberia moun
tain battery then came lip and seized
a commanding height, from which It
joined the field battery In shelling the
Japanese position and finally drove
them out, but the fighting cost us 150
men."

But according to the statements of
the active jurors the misgivings that
have been Ions entertained are about
to be realized, for out of the nineteen
members of the jury there are but eleven
counted on to stand up in bringing any
further charges. The only hope held

Juror who might be brought to see the
error of his way and co-operate with
those who are bent on returning in

ing up a solid phalanx of twelve was
cot very strong, however.

The Jurors who have sought to un
rarth the conspiracy to stuff ballot
boxes at the primaries feel that they

tuting prosecution against men who are
believed to have only carried out in
structions of others. Men of high stand

teyt vote as to the Election Commission
this afternoon makes it apparent, as
they regard it, that further investiga

useless, it is probable that the court
vlll be asked to dismiss the Grand
Jury at once.
Several weeks have now been spent
in taking testimony and the only re
sults are the Indictment of two men.
One was Adolph Steffens, a fraudulent
voter, and the other Joseph Rebstock,
Â¦who is accused of misconduct while
*erving as Inspector in the Eightieth or
Almshouse precinct. Rebstock was
taken into custody yesterday and the
true bill against him will be returned
to-day.
The discord among the grand jurors
over the effort to Indict the Election
Commissioners is so pronounced that an
open rupture is likely at the meeting
this afternoon. As a result of the row
that brought about an abrupt adjourn
ment Tuesday night, several members
have declared that they will not attend
eny more sessions. The Jurors who

violation of the law inhibiting the

vestigation.
Joseph Rebstock was placed under
arrest yesterday in anticipation of an
indictment that will be returned
against him this afternoon. Foreman
LiMenfeld of the Grand Jury gave the
instructions to the police, It being
feared that Rebstock might take* to
flight before the bench warrant could

Rebstock served as inspector in the
Almshouse district, and Fairfax H.

that he refused to administer the oath
to voters when the witnesses chal

several inmates of the poorhouse to

clearly demonstrated they were not en

how the Jury stands, what influences

will mean the end of the Grand Jury.
"However, if there should be an un
expected turn In affairs and we find
that we have votes enough to go ahead
with prosecutions whenever the evi

law. In fact. If we are assured by the
result of to-morrow's session that we
have a working number of grand
jurors, we skall In all probability go
Into things with renewed vigor."
The Election Commissioners are al
leged to have made appointment of
election officers without regard to the
provisions of the law that the officers
must be taxpayers and residents of the
precincts in which they serve. Messrs.
Roberts, Voorsanger, Devoto, Leffing

tion when called before the Jury, but
their plea is that the statutes in this
connection are impractical and uncon

REBSTOCK T7XDER ARREST.
PORTLAND, Oct. 12.â Nearly 400
telephone operators employed In the
two main offices of the Pacific States
Telephone and Telegraph Company in,
this city walked out shortly after 1
o'clock to-day, having declared a strike
against the company, alleging cruel
and unjust treatment by a supervising
forewoman, who alternates between
this city and Spokane. Six girls re
fused to join in the movement and. did
their best to satisfy the demands of
the thousands of subscribers in this
city and vicinity.
As soon as the strike was declared the
local manager of the company com
municated with headquarters in San
Francisco, asking that experienced op
erators be sent here at once. It is
understood here that the Telephone Op
erators' Union in San Francisco re
fused to sanction such a move on the
part of the company. Shortly before
2 o'clock the strikers returned to work
under promise of the telephone com
pany's officials that the matter would
be fully Investigated and all wrongs,
should they exist, be adjusted to the
satisfaction of the operators.
Trouble has been brewing in the lo
cal office of the telephone company for
some time, due, the strikers say, to
the actions of a supervising fore
woman wljo has inaugurated a system
of "demerits" or "marks" for the in
fraction of rules which the operators
assert are overrlgid and inhuman. Each
"mark" against an operator means a
deduction from her salary at the end
of the month; eight marks for three
successive months results in the oper
ator's position being taken from her.
The girls, to the number of 100, met
last night and organized a union,
which has affiliated with the Federated
Trades Council. It was determined
that unless to-day brought an ame
lioration of the alleged wrongs that at
a given signal the operators would
leave their boards and walk out. Word
of the Impending strike was passed
among the several hundred operators
who were unable- to attend last night's
meeting, and when the signal was given
shortly after 1 o'clock almost the en
tire operating force quit their places.

to guide the party, but on an errand,'
speaking of one I call a Moses â Alton
B. Parker." \ -
Throughout his speech he insisted
that it was not for the sake of appear
ance or "being in, line," but through
sincerity, that he championed the cause
of Parker : ; and Davis and a united
Democratic party. Bryan was inter
rupted by repeated cheers and the
large- crowd remained attentive until
the end.

MEETING AT MERCED.
BRYAN IN INDIANAPOLIS.
Abraham Zihn, who says that he is
71 years old and inexperienced In
business matters, yesterday began suit
to compel his daughter, Mary R. J.
Thorp, to convey to him a fourth in
terest in the property at 1915-1921
Howard street, which he deeded to
three other daughters in trust in Feb
ruary. 1902. According to his com
plaint he owed $5000 to John Center
and gave him a mortgage on the prop
erty. Then, he says, his three daugh
ters, Clara, Emma and Elizabeth,
whom he declares to be experienced
women, induced him to deed the prop
erty to them until thr mortgage was
paid and then they would reconvey it.
The father asserts that he told his
daughter Mary in August last that his
daughters held a deed to the property
and that Mary went to them and
threatened to report that they had
defrauded their father unless they
gave her a fourth interest in the prop
erty. The three daughters deeded the
Interest she asked for and on October
8 they reconveyed the three-fourths
to their father. When he demanded
the one-fourth from Mary she refused
to give It up, claiming it as her own.
The three dutiful daughters are made
defendants in order to set aside their
transfer to Mary.
Says He Conveyed It in Trust, but One
of Four Refuses to Surrender
Share.

Mr. Kahn then spoke of the Phil
ippines and said that when^the,Fili
pinos were ready for self-government
it .would be" 1 the business of our chil
dren's children to see that they re
ceived it. He closed with an appeal
to local voters to support the Repub
lican ticket in the coming election and
send a solid. Republican delegation to
the ' Legislature and the national cap
ital.
The most Interesting and potent results of
Democratic misrule may be shown by the sta
tistics of the savings banks of California dur
ing the Democratic administration of four
years and the Republican administration of
eight years. During the Democratic four years
the falling off of savings bank deposits in
California was $10,000,000 and of assets $13,
000.000. Four yearn after the Republicans re
sumed control .the saving's banks showed $24,
000,000 in deposits in excess of the previous
four years, and for the second four-year course
of Republican rule the amount was $68,000,000.
And this was not rich men's money. The- nav
inss banks are the poor man's savings Insti
tutions. â¢ , * . â¢ ' Â¦
The* Republicans of the Firty-first
Assembly District turned out in force
last night to give Julius Kahn, the
Republican candidate for Congress
from the Fourth Congressional Dis
trict, a hearty welcome. The meeting
of the stalwarts took place in Steimke
Hall on Octavia street, near Union,
and the march of the candidate to the
hall was done to the music of bands
and in the glare of torches and red
fire. The Nathan C. Coghlan Club,
named after the Republican nominee
for Assemblyman from the Forty
first, was very much in evidence.
After Julius Kahn entered the hall
and had been seated in the seat of
honor, Edward J. Pringle, chairman,
celled for order and introduced the
first speaker, Nathan C. Coghlan.
' In a short spech Coghlan told of his j
thanks for his nomination to the As- ,
sembly and his appreciation of the
honor. He then dwelt briefly upon
the record of the Republican party
and called attention to the condition
of the working-man of to-day and that
of the laborer of ten years ago.
The Republican nominee for Supe
rior Judge, Daniel W. Burchard, was
introduced and told briefly of condi
tions in the Philippines and the un
readiness of the .Filipinos for self
government. Senatorial Candidate
John H. Nelson preceded the chief
speaker of the evening, Julius Kahn.
Upon the presentation of the Con
gressional candidate the hall shook
with applause. In his opening re
marks Mr. Kahn said that it was a
great privilege to be able to address
the voters of his home district and
that It augured well for Republican
success that in Republican strong
holds the registration had greatly in
creased, whereas in Democratic pre
cincts the gain was small. Then he
told of the hard times consequent
upon Democratic rule and described
the differences between England's sys
tem of tariff duties and that of the
United States. Continuing, he said:

thusiastic for Nominee.

Senator. Daniel declared that he is
having a more strenuous time in keep
ing up with Davis that he had in fol
lowing Stonewall Jackson in a gray
jacket during the war. The train was
sidetracked at Fairmont for the night.
An indication of the earnest side of
the campaign was the attendance of
miners, who had left their work tem
porarily to hear the speakers. While
Davis is a serious talker, especially
when he touches on State, Issues, which
he has been emphasizing, his general
address and * odd manner of abruptly,
introducing himself, "I suppose you
know I am Davis, who * Is â¢ flying
through, looking for friends and votes,"
has the ffect of placing his hearers at
ease after they have cheered the an
nouncement. \-'-- >--'â¢; :
At Grafton and Clarksburg the day
seemed to be set apart as a holiday. In
Clarksburg an elaborate marching es
cort and several hands were In waiting.
The party was conducted to the Court
house, and the speeches, which were
delivered from the portico of the jail,
were listened to by a large audience.
FAIRMONT, W. Va,, Oct. 12.â Henry
G. Davis' second day of campaigning
through Maryland and West Virginia
was more intense and satisfactory than
the first. It also added to the reputa
tion of Davis as a "young old man."
He repeated his record of yesterday
with a dozen speeches, and added one
more for, good measure. ; Despite the
rain, which followed the train during
the first half of the day, there was no
dampening of enthusiasm or diminish
ing of the crowds which greeted the
candidate. -

Chicago's Mayor Says Democratic
Harmony Prevails In Illinois.
NEW YORK, Oct. 12.â Mayor Harri
son of Chicago conferred to-day with
Alton B. Parker concerning political
affairs in Illinois, Wisconsin and Indi
ana. He pledged the loyalty of all
wings of the Democratic party in Illi
nois, declared that factional disturb
ances in Illinois had been eliminated
and that the German vote is Demo
cratic and concluded with the state
ment that this gives to the Demo
crats a chance to carry the State,
which is nominally Republican.
Mayor Harrison's visit lasted two
hours. When Mayor Harrison left
Judge Parker he said laughingly: "I
came to deliver the electoral vote of
Illinois. Wisconsin and Indiana."
Afterward he said if that was not a
big enough contract he might include
the vote of Iowa. ;
Judge Parker saw many persons to
day and In the evening received a
large number of New York county
committeemen, who were in conference
to-day with the State committee. The
candidate's callers to-day Included Sen
ator Gorman, Delancey Nlcoll and
Hilary A. Herbert, Secretary of the
Navy under former President Cleve

Esopus to-morrow and to return to
New York on Monday.
Scofield to Remain In the Fight la

MILWAUKEE, Oct 12.â The na

This was decided to-day after a pro
tracted meeting of the Stalwarts.
Among' those who took part In the
conference were: Senator Spooner.
former Governor Scofield and former
Governor Upharh.
Senator Spooner, It is said, was in
favor of withdrawing the ticket in the
interest of the national and Congres
sional tickets. Spooner left the meet
ing shortly after he had spoken on the
subject. He took this step, he said, in
order not to embarrass others whose
views might be different from his. Be
fore the meeting adjourned a resolu
tion was passed unanimously in favor
of keeping the ticket in the field.

DEMOCRAT FOR ROOSEVELT.
SAN DIEGO, Oct. 12. â David De-
Witt Lawrence, who was the regular
Democratic nominee for the Assembly
in the Eightieth District, has resigned
from the ticket, giving as his reason
that he has decided to support Roose
velt and therefore cannot conscienti
ously remain on the ticket of his op
ponent.
Stenographic reporters were not at
the table, hence a verbatim report of
the talk cannot be given, but accord
ing to gossip in political circles sev
eral significant speeches were listened
to by United States Senator George C.
Perkins, former United States Senator
Charles N. Felton.' Fred S. Stratton,
Collector of Customs; Dr. Chester
Rowell, Regent of the University and
State Senator Thomas B. Bishop, an
eminent attorney, and T. B. McFar
land, Associate Justice of the State
Supremo Court.
The talk of the senior Senator was
especially significant. Â¦ He paid high
compliment to the character and pub
lic services of his colleague, Senator
Bard." Dr. Rowell was so impressed
with Perkins' estimate of Bard's
worth to California in the Senate of
the United States that- he was im
pelled to request the senior Senator to
take the public into his confidence.
There is no doubt that Collegtor
Stratton said just what a leading Fed
eral office holder should say on such
an occasion. Senator Felton is not
given to much talking, but his talks
are clear and directly to the point-
What he said was surely lucid.
Judge McFarland is always enter
taining and T. B. Bishop is entertain
ing and eloquent too. The company,
however, listened with the keenest at
tention to the remarks of Senator Per
kins, who was called upon to respond
to the sentiment that Senator Bard
might be his colleague In the United
States Senate for a long time. Whether
it was the champagne, the company or
both that inspired the senior Senator
is not definitely stated, but he spoke
so frankly and insplringly In praise
of his colleague that his remarks were
a greater, refreshment .than the wine.
X>r. r Bowell, who Is something of a stole,
possessing the power to hold his emo
tions in restraint, was moved to ex
claim: "Senator Perkins, you ought
to talk that way to the public."
Senator Perkins was kindly solicited
yesterday to give The Call a summary
of his remarks, but ne was not in
clined to attach much importance to
his talk at the luncheon. When asked
if he had definitely declared himself in
favor of Senator Bard's re-election he
authorized The Call to quote him as
saying that his colleague was a high
minded, honorable man of character
and strength, whose services to Cali
fornia i^n the Senate were of great value.
The Senator remarked that he could
hardly be expected to declare himself
in favor of Mr. Bard's candidacy when
his old time friends George Knight and
Frank Flint had announced themselves
as candidates. "You can quote me,"
said the senior Senator, "as saying
anything and everything in commend
ation" of Senator Bard. I could not
leave my place in the Senate to visit
Sacramento and engage in the contest
in his behalf. I did not do that for
myself, but I have offered to make
speeches with him in support of the
Republican ticket, and if I had to de
clare my first choice among the can
didates for the Senate I would name
Senator Bard." N
The luncheon given by Jarrett T.
Richards last Monday at the Pacific-
Union Club to United States Senator
Thomas R. Bard and a few friends
must have been an interesting func
tion. Mr. Richards himself is a host
of many' excellent attributes. He is
president of the Santa Barbara Cham
ber of Commerce, one of the leading
lawyers of Southern California and a
lifelong friend of Mr. Bard.
The Republican party has been the loyal. In
telligent supporter of republican institutions
from the time Abraham Lincoln took the oath
of office in the national Capitol down to this
beautiful morning. It has been the steadfast
adherent of those policies which are for the
upbuilding of our national strength and the
expansion of our glory everywhere.
The speech at Rock Island was de
voted to a defense of the currency and
tariff policies of the Republican party,
and the speech made here to-night was
along the same lines. ;.
Our Democratic friends have suggested from
time to time that there is some danger of im
perialism. They have got It into their heads
that the Republican party is inimical to the
republic; that the Republican party in some
way or other is going to subvert our repub
lican institutions and build upon their ruins
imperialism. Did you ever hear of a more
preposterous suggestion since the stars first
sang together?
DAVENPORT. Iowa, Oct. 12.â With
a speech at Turner Opera-house â¢ to
night Senator Fairbanks concluded his
tour of Iowa. He reached Davenport
this afternoon on the Rock Island Rail
road, and after crossing the Mississip
pi River and speaking at Little Rock
he returned to Davenport for to-night's
meeting.
In addition to these two points he
spoke during the day at Des Moines,
Colfax, Newton, Kellogg, Grinnell,
Brooklyn, Marengo, Iowa City, West
Liberty and Durant. The crowds at
the meeting to-night were large, but
the meetings of the day were, not as
well* attended as were those of yester
day. The longest stay to-day was made
at Iowa City, where the meeting was
attended by a club of 200 students call
ing themselves- "Teddy's Hawkeyes."
To them, as to the students at Grinnell,
Senator Fairbanks addressed himself
especially, telling them that "the Re
publican party stands for principles as
fixed and enduring as the stars."
A large part of the day was spent In
the Second Congressional District, the
only Democratic district in Iowa. .
Both at Davenport and Brooklyn
Senator Fairbanks discussed imperial
ism. At Brooklyn he said:
After this question had .been finally
determined Attorney Cameron H. King,
representing the supporters of certain
of the proposed amendments . to the
charter, that had been rejected by the
board, said that those he represented
would not be satisfied With the turn
matters had taken and announced that
this morning he will take the question
The spirits of the anti-petition lobby
that had assembled, headed by Attor
ney M. H. Wascerwitz, who represent
ed the Brewers| Protective Association,
fell perceptibly at this point, while
those of the Civic Council, headed by
Attorney J. E. White, brightened. But
the board was not to be denied. Sig
natures were picked out which the
board said It would declare to be forged
and ordered stricken out. Then Hand
writing Expert Carl Elsenschimel was
thrown into the breach and identified
several signatures which he said were
forged beyond a doubt.
Then the commissioners began to tes
tify. Commissioner Maguire did not
believe the present petition would
stand. Commissioner Lefflngwell also
stated that he knew the work of the
Registrar had been faithfully perform
ed and his statement was corroborated
by Chairman Roberts and so on down
the line of the commission.
For this reason the board said it
would deny the request of those that
had presented the petition that they be
given an opportunity to check the work
of the Registrar's deputies, stating that
it would delay the preparation of the
precinct lists and interfere with the en
tire election. Pleading on the part â¢ of
the petitioners was in vain, the call for
the vote was given and the petition was
rejected unanimously. The Civic Coun
cil has not yet given up the fight, it
says, but just what action it intends to
take will develop soon, for time 'is
growing short.
QUESTION OP FORGERY.
When the Question was presented to
the board last night Registrar Walsh
said that an investigation of the peti
tion had developed the fact that out
of the 10,324 names it contained but
6957 were registered, 3181 were not reg
istered and 1S6 were missing from the
addresses given. This left them 2917
short of sufficient signatures to entitle
the proposed amendment petitioned for
a place on the ballot
In addition to this fact, the Registrar
said, palpable forgery had been com
mitted on the petitions. As an Instance
of this alleged forgery he pointed to the
names of S. A. Ray, F. I. Sprague, Ed
gar L. Ireland and W. A. Creswell, the
names of which were signed in the
same peculiar-colored ink. These four
men named had been cited at the ad
dresses given on the petition to ap
pear, for what purpose they did not
know. When their names were called
they all appeared and identified their
signatures and announced that they
had signed them all at the same time
and place, and with the fountain pen of
James M. McElhinney. ' ; .K
The figures presented by the Regis
trar showed that when the petition was
filed it contained 10,324 names, 9874 be
ing sufficient under the law to assure
the proposed amendment a place on
the ballot, this latter number being 15
per cent of the total vote cast at the
last general election. When it came in,
the Registrar said, sixty-five clerks fell
upon it and for three days and three
nights they fingered it in search of
legal blunders, illegal commissions and
ill advised omissions. Their campaign
was successful.
The fight that preceded the rejection
of the petition for the charter amend
ment establishing a hlgn liquor license
was the picturesque affair of the even
ing, however. It developed enterprise
and activity on the part of the elec
tion commission, the Registrar and his
small army of deputies beyond the be
lief of the most optimistic citizen.
PICTURESQUE AFFAIR.
Louis Ferari, who was nominated by
the recent Democratic convention for
the office of Justice of the Peace, also
fell under the negative impulse of the
Election Commission. Ferari demand
ed that his name be placed on the bal
lot notwithstanding the decision of the
commission that there is no vacancy
in the office of Justice of the Peace, it
having been held by the courts that
Justices hold office for a period of -four
years. Ferari has appealed to the Su
preme Court for a writ of mandate to
compel the placing of his name on the
ballot.
With . fixed determination not to be
swerved by argument from the deci
sion it had reached against the pro
posed charter amendment having as its
purpose the establishment of a high
liquor license, the Board of Election
Commissioners last night denied the i
petition of the Civic Council that such 1
proposed amendment be placed on the I
ballot at the next general election, j
Every argument advanced by the rep
resentatives of the federation or others
that have been active in preparing the
petition was met by counter attack by
some members of the board, or by the J
figures of Registrar Adams, with the i
result that the final decision of the j
board rejecting the petition only j
amounted to the retardation of a fore- j
gone conclusion. i
With equal determination the com- |
mission decided against the twenty-two
proposed amendments to the charter
adopted by the Board of Supervisors,
eleven of which were vetoed by the
Mayor, with the recommendation that j
the other eleven be withheld from the
ballot in view of the provision that I
amendments to the charter cannot h'i I
voted for within two years of each sub
mission, the" last election on such
amendments being held on December 4,
1902. The board held that the position ;
taken by the Mayor was correct and
sustained him by its action in refusir./j
the proposed amendments a place on
the ballots.
Thomas Taggart, national chair
man, whose presence in Indiana Is
deemed essential just now, refuses to
absent himself from the national
headquarters In this city unless he can
carry with him the money he believes
necessary to insure victory. If New
York and Indiana obtain from the
general fund all the money that is
considered necessary by the men most
interested in the campaign, then New
Jersey, Connecticut, Rhode Island, the
West and South believe they will be
thrown upon their own resources.
the managers of Parker's campaign
are determined to save New York,
even at the sacrifice of other States,
so that he might be the logical candi
date in 1903 in the event of the elec
tion of President Roosevelt.
S. Greenbaum, William Bourn and I.
Ackerman, who had been cited to ap
pear and show cause why they should
not serve as election officers, failed to
put in a nappearance.
"I move," said Commissioner Lef
fingwell, "that these men be now cited
to appear to show cause if they can
why they should not be arrested and
prosecuted under the law for refus
ing to appear and qualify to serve as
election officers as they have been di
rected."
Cooler counsel prevailed and Lefflng
well modified his motion to cover the
issuance of another simple citation con
taining no direct nor implied threat.
The motion prevailed.
The commission then adjourned until
next Tuesday night at 8 o'clock.
T. Cary Friedlander and Homer S,
King both wrote that they probably
would be out of the city on election
day. The Registrar was directed to
inform them that if they are in town
they wfll be expected to serve. Frank
J. Devlin also fell under this ruling.
A. Sbarboro announced that he had
been appointed by Governor Pardee to
represent California at the Trans-
Mississippi Congress and the Inter
state Commerce Commission and prob
ably would be out of town on election
day, though he would be glad to serve
if here. His excuse was accepted.
FAIL TO APPEAR.
Patrick McGoldrich, Union Labor
nominee for the Assembly in the Thir
ty-ninth District, filed a petition ask
ing that his name be withheld from the
ballot, stating that he had no desire to
run for office. His petition will be
granted.
Then came the consideration of the
petitions of prominent citizens that had
been appointed to serve as election of
ficers to be excused from duty. S. G.
Murphy, president of the First Nation
al Bank, who resides at the St. Francis
Hotel, presented a certificate signed by
Dr. James W. Keeney to the effect that
Mr. Murphy was suffering from the grip
and would be unable to serve as an
election officer. Commissioner Lefflng
well said he had been informed that
Mr. Murphy attended to his business
at the bank dally and that if he could
do this work he could serve the people
in an election booth. Upon motion of
Commissioner Devoto the physician's
certificate was disregarded and a cita
tion was directed to Mr. Murphy di
recting him to appear personally be
fore the board and show cause why he
should not serve.

NOMINEE WITHDRAWS.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 12. â Fred
Raick. 14 years old, a bootblack
known as "Frisco Kid." has come to
town, having beaten his way across
the continent from San Francisco with
the avowed purpose of shining Presi
dent Roosevelt's shoes. He presented
himself at the White House yesterday
and made friends instantly. He did
not see the President, but was given
dinner and Secretary Loeb promised
to intercede for him and secure the
privilege of shining the President's
shoes. This he did to-day and the boy
will go away happy.
He has visited St. Louis, New York.
Boston, Philadelphia and other cities
without having paid one cent railroad
fare. He left home with but fifteen
cents In his pockets. He says there Is
no place like San Francisco after "all
and will start at once on his return
trip by the brakebeam.
OMAHA, Oct. 12.â To Mrs. James Mc-
Carthy of this city th:s morning was
presented the ordeal of selecting which
of her three children she would save
'rum i-erishing !n a fire. One was a
boy of 10 years, another a girl of 7 and
the third a baby. Clouds of flames en
veloped the McCarthy dwelling. To the
fi antic mother there seemed a slight
t nance of saving one of the little ones
asleep in a small cnam&er off the
kitchen, and that at the point of the
rescuer's life. The baby was the child
the mother decided to save.
Three times Mrs. McCarthy made her
way through the mass of names, each
time emerging with one of her family.
After the last trip she fell unconscious.
The hospital physicians say she is in
ternally burned and cannot live.
During Mrs. McCarthy's momentary
absence from the house a kerosene
lamp left lighted on the kitchen table
exploded and scattered miming oil on
the shavings in the wood Dox. In a
few minutes the house was ablaze.
None of the neighbors, attracted by
the fire, dared to enter- A horse blanket
on the kitchen porch was seized by
Mrs. McCarthy and used to wrap the
children In as she carried them, drowsy
with sleep, from their beds to a place
of safety in the yard.

The resignation of Bishop Thomas A.

At the afternoon session of the House

the whole, 'Rev. Robert Ritchie of
Philadelphia discussed the ninth verse
of the nineteenth chapter of St. Mat

posed - canon assert authorizes the re
marriage of the innocent person who
has been divorced, and quoted further
from the New Testament to show that
marriage was Indissoluble, except by
death.
Rev. Dr. F. W. Clampett of San

Rev. E. A. Larrabee of Chicago, in

BOSTON, Oct. 12.â A marked revi

posal to prevent the marriage of the
Innocent party to a divorce during the
life of the former partner developed at
to-day's session of the House of Depu
ties of the Episcopal General Conven

tee of the whole, discussed the issue
the whole day and many vehement
addresses were made, by both sides.
Several prominent delegates expressed
the opinion to-night, in view of the
differences of opinion, the present con
vention would not act on the question,
but would, like its predecessor, refer the
problem to the next triennial confer

The handsome young girl who com
mitted suicide on Tuesday and who
was supposed to be Mabel M. Lawrence
proves to have been Lillle Marie Mack. |
She' was the daughter of Mrs. Annie'
Mack, living at 40 Gilbert street. What i
was the occasion or the reason for her
taking her life ls^ enshrouded^ in mys
tery.
Three months ago she left her home
one afternoon, saying "Good-by, mother,
I am going out for a little walk on
Market street, but will be home early." j
That was the last her family saw of j
her until they saw her body on 'a slab j
at the Morgue. As she had adopted an
assumed name she would have un- !
doubtedly passed out of sight and her
people would never have known of her
untimely end had' they not seen her
photograph in The Call yesterday
morning. Mrs. Mack, the mother of
the unfortunate girl, is broken-hearted
over the tragedy. For thirty .. years
Mrs. Mack and her family have lived |
in the neighborhood where they now
reside. Mrs. Mack has the highest re
spect, and esteem of every one in that
vicinity.
In speaking of the affair last night
the broken-hearted niother said:
LiHle has always been a good girl, but she
was fond of going out. - Her two brothers,
John and Willie, would occasionally remon
strate with her, and wanted her to stay more
at home. She used to work in the canning
factory with me, and besides this she used to
do the housework for the family. I have
worked hard all my life and saved | every
nickel I possibly could to help dress her nicely,
and I also saved up a little money to put
aside to help her In case I should die. For
three months she has been away. Her brother
has searched everywhere over the city at night
to try and find her. Her father took his life
in February, 1001, while laboring underj the
effects of temporary Insanity causÂ«d by epilep
tic fits. Poor Lillle was subject to slight at
tacks of the same affliction. . She was always
worried about herself and waa afraid that
some day she would . go insane. I am of the
opinion she was insane when she killed herself.
I do not know anything about the trip to Seat
tle. She had never gone there previous to the
time when she left me. I am not acquainted
with any young man who had ever kept com
pany with her.
Her friend and companion, Miss Ella
Lef evre, was greatly upset over the
death of Miss Mack and was amazed
\vhen she learned of her antecedents.
She said she always supposed that Lillie
came from Seattle and that she was
entirely friendless. Miss Lefevre said
that while the girl was in the employ
of C. C. Lord at 320 Kearny street she
was very quiet and modest. Periodi
cally she was very melancholy, and
.once she told Miss Lefevre that she
was subject to epilepsy and was afraid
at that moment that she was going to
have- an attack. Miss Lefevre says she
never heard her speak of any love af
fair and that in the Â¦ short time she
knew her she never saw her with any
man. She added, however, that there
was some mystery, she thought, behind
the girl's suicide, but what it was she
had no idea. She said she had in
formed Miss Adams at 1005 Powell
street, where the girl died, to take care
of all her effects and to surrender them
only to the girl's mother.
Regarding the rumors of a certain
Archie, whose name was connected
with the affair, neither Miss Lefevre
nor Mrs. Mack could throw any light.
The funeral of the unfortunate girl
will take place from her mother's home
to-morrow morning at Iff o'clock.

SAN JOSE, Oct. 12.â Because she was
deprived' of a husband and received
permanent injuries Mrs. Sarah E.
Johnson demands $60,350 damages from
the Southern Pacific ' Railroad Com
pany. While on a trip from New York
to this city to marry Dr. James W.
Hitchcock she was injured in a train
collision in the depot yards here. She
attributes the accident to the careless
ness, negligence and want of skill of
the employes of the railroad company.
Mrs. Johnson in her complaint alleges
that she received permanent injuries
to:her spine and was severely bruised
about the body, causing great physical
suffering. She was in a hospital from
June 20, 1904, to October 5, 1904, and is
now confined to her- house and can only,
walk with the greatest difficulty.
She was on her way here to marry
Dr. James W. Hitchcock. The wed
ding to occur June 21, 1904, the day
following the accident. Because of the
injuries received, .she claims, she had
been prevented from marrying Hitch
cock and has been rendered forever in
capable of marrying.
The $60,350 damages asked are divided
as follows: For injuries received in the
wreck, $50,000; physician bills, $350; loss
of husband, $10,000.

The doctor closed with the senti
ment that this noble vale should be
the care of the national Government.
Like, the Yellowstone and other reser
vations, he said, United States officers
should be its guardians. The State
Commission with little funds at its dis
posal doubtless does the best, said the
speaker, that it can, but that Is
insufficient. He spoke of the con
cessions that are given certain people
in the valley for a money considera
tion, and though he did not say so, he
left the impression on the minds of his
intelligent hearers that he noted the
"side show" characters that mar the
matchless grandeur of the noble place.
The national Government in its care
of its wonderful reservations does not
eke out its expense account by selling
money-making privileges.
Rev. George C. Adams, who re
turned from a vacation in the To

description of his journey at the First
Congregational Church on Wednesday

carried the attention of his audience

and past the spot where the pinnacles
of granite lift high in midair and the
falling waters float veil-like over the
upper rims of cliff.

a denial of any killing of four employes

"Because I killed four men in Alaska
in 1898 and I did not -want to get

near Fort McPherson, in the Mackenzie
River country, about 200 miles above
Dawson. He said he had about $36,000
in gold dust and that the four men
' On his hospital cot Averell said his
real name was Clark, and that his
mother and brothers live in Ottawa.
"Why have you been going under an
assumed name?"
SAYS HE KILLED FOUR JIEX.
"I shall do all I can to save her life.
Dr. Stephens, the chief surgeon of the
hospital, told me he would take the
case, and I must now seek my friends
for money to pay him, inasmuch as this
trouble has come at a very unfortu
nate time for me."
"My wife, without reason, thought I
was not faithful to her," he said, "and
thÂ«-n she formed the alliance 'with Av
erell. She declared finally she would
leave me, and while I was on my sick
bed I told her to go. This man who
came between us seemed to have some
strange Influence over her. She went
to live with him. A few days ago I
met my wife and we talked things
over. Through illness she has become
addicted to morphine and I did not
hold her responsible for her acts. I was
willing to sacrifice everything if I couid
induce her to lead a better life again.
The result was that she agreed to re
turn to me.
At the Central Emergency Hospital
the woman was placed on the table for
examination first, and Averell lay on a
stretcher near by.
"Die. will you; die, will you," he
called out repeatedly In response to her
groans of agony.
Mr?. Lockwood was found to have
been shot in the mouth, shattering her
front teeth, but the bullet had come
out throujrh the gum. Two bullets en
tered under the left shoulder and
passed through the lung, and the fourth
struck the middle finger of the right
hand. As to himself, Averell had failed
to touch the heart, the bullet pene
trating the lung instead.
Lockwood came to the hospital in re
pponse to a message and showed strong
devotion to his wife. He had her re
moved to a private sanitarium later.
TELLS HER TO DIE.
Mrs. Lockwood had been out the
evening before to meet her husband,
Benjamin W. F. Lockwood, who is an
industrious painter, and had promised
that she would mend her ways and
forsake the man for whom she de
serted her husband. Averell learned
what was s^ing on and was aroused to
a jealous rage. His mood was already
aggravated because he had been dis
charged the day before from employ
ment as a cook in a restaurant at Turk
and Hyde streets.
Mrs. Lockwood falling to return until
a late hour in the night, Averell waited
until morning to carry out his diabol
ical purpose. It was shortly after 9
o'clock when he stole into her room,
and as she lay sleeping in the bed be
gan to shoot at her. The first report
of tho revolver aroused her, and she
began to cry for help. At intervals that
were almost regular the shots could be
heard above her frantic calls as the en
raged lover fired three times more.
Believing he had mortally wounded
the woman. Averell held the pistol to
his breast, aiming inaccurately for the
heart. Sweltering in blood both were
found by Charles Green, a young man
who lives in the house, and a policeman
was quickly summoned.
Because Mrs. Lulu Lockwood had
come to see the error of her way, and
tras about to return to her husband,
her life was sought by her paranvmr
with a fiendish band in her room at
223 Mason street yesterday rnoi/iing,
and after he had wounded her -vith four
bullets he turned the pistol upon him
self in an endeavor to pierce his cruel
heart. His name is Fred Averell, and
his insane purpose may be defeated, for
both he and his victim are thought to
ha\ e chances of recovery.

Miss KatHerine Doyer.
; : . Â¦ . -â¢Â¦ â¢
When you are sick in some part of your body it is
because some organ is not doing its work properly.
Every organ of the body is absolutely controlled by,
the nerves. . ' t
Weak, "run down" nerves tell of their condition by
stopping the proper action of some one organ, or of
several organs, of the body. ,
"Medical science has for the past seventeen y"ears agreed,
with the teachings of Prof. Edward' E. Phelps of Dart-'
mouth University ; . .
Prof. Phelps was the first physician to openly declare
twenty years ago that the health of the human body
depends entirely upon the, health of the nerves.'
Prof. Phelps formulated the prescription of Faine'Â£<
Celery Compound. The first druggist that this pre^
scription was taken to was a man by the name of
Paine. One of the principal. fngredients of the pre-
scription is the seed of the celery plant. ;
After two years' trial of the prescription by Prof
Phelps and a number of the leading Massachusetts
physicians it was decided to place this prescription be-
fore the public. ;
The formula was sent to every registered physician
in the United States. The prescription was named
Paine's Celery Compound, and one of the largest and
oldest manufacturing chemists in the , country. Wells,
Richardson & Co., of Burlington, Vt., undertook its pro-
duction.
Paine's Celery Compound has stood the test of seven-;
teen years' constant use. It has been for the past seven-
teen years, and is to-day, the most universally used
tonic prescription in the world.
A photograph of Miss Katherlne Doyer, of
Brooklyn, appears at the head of this arti- , '
cte. Miss Doyer's experience is given in
her own words to illustrate the effective
work that Paine's Celery Compound Is con*
stantly doing as the curative agent In the
nourishing and rebuilding of .."rundown"
nerves. ~s
"Some time ago I gradually began to
'grow weak and emaciated; my eyes became
dull, my sight poor and my head dizzy. I
* was restless and nervous and troubled with
bad dreams; I. had shooting pains In my
stomach and suffered nausea after eating.
I consulted a physician, who said I had ca-
tarrh of the stomach. I took his prescript
tion for nearly six months, but got no better.
Hearing .so much of Patne's Celery Com.
pound, I decided to try It. It was a fortu-
nate thing for me ( that I did, for Inside of
two months I was entirely cured and have
never had a return of any nervous troubles
since." â Miss Katherlne Ooyer, 422 Gold St.,
Brooklyn, N. YÂ« August 15. 1904:
â Paine's Celery Compound is a nerve invigorator, a
regulator and an ideal blood cleanser. It takes away
the "wear" on the nerves and enables them to work
without tearing, themselves to pieces, and it prevents
the unhealthy reaction of tired nerves on the entire'
.system.
It solves the problem of how to build up the nervous'
system, as no other remedy has ever done.
It cures the causes of constipation, biliousness, dys-
pepsia, headaches, sleeplessness and every sign of im-,
pure bloodJ Nervousness â whether in the form of
headaches, sleeplessness, indigestion, melancholia, irri-
tability or any one of a host of other troublesâ is a disease,*
and as such can be driven from the system by the use of
Paine's Celery Compound.
Remember this, â Paine's jCelery Compound is the pre^
scription of one of the most famous physicians this coiin- 1
try has ever known, and all reputable druggists sell and
recommend it.

The charges made against the mun
icipal garbage crematory recently es
tablished at Twenty-second and Wood
streets, by Leonardi Vinci, wno at
tempted to stop the operation of the
works by Injunction proceedings,, fell
flat this afternoon when Judge Ells
worthy rendered an opinion denying
the relief prayed for and giving it as
his opinion that from the evidence
produced before him a great deal of
the talk against the works was the
result of overwrought imaginations.
In a lengthy opinion rendered at the
conclusion of the trial, which has con
sumed more, than a week, Judge Ells
worth this ' evening said that the
charges made against the crematory
had not been proven and from the
evidence produced It was almost im
possible that the conditions alleged
could exist.
It was shown that the Vinci home
had been built upon a garbage dump.
The crematory was located upon one
and the evidence went to show that
the big sewer running through that
part "of the city was broken In many
places and gave off offensive odors.
The court did not believe that these
could be attributed to the crematory.

Mrs. Joe Ghlrardelll la planning .a little
afternoon- affair for to-morrow and as she
has announced that it is complimentary to her
slater, MIbb Jessie Barstow. the' Invited ones
are wondering whether or no a certain happy
little announcement is to be made. The atten
tions of a certain young man from Llvermore
have been very evident and- Dame Grundy has
been listening for the tinkle of approaching
wedding bells, v \ :. Â¦ 5 f.
The bride is the youngest daughter of Ed
ward P. Taylor, the pioneer stationer of this
city, and has been a popular girl In her set â
a fact well shown in the numerous and costly
wedding gifts. Her husband Is a young busi
ness man of* San Francisco, where they will
reside. Mr. and Mrs. Ireland are going to the
southland for their honeymoon, and after the
16th of November they will be. at>horae to
their friends at the Nordhoff. . â¢
Beneath a wedding bell of white chrysanthe
mums' Mlaa Florence Taylor became MrÂ».
James Ireland this evening at her parents'
home on Fourteenth street. The ceremony
itself was a simple affair ' and was wlt
ncrsed by the Immediate family only, but, the
reception after was attended by nearly two"
hundred frlendai The bride was a demure pic
ture in gauzy veil, white lace robe and lilies
of the valley, the dainty flowers fastening th>
veil in place and forming the shower bouquet.
The bride's cousin. Miss Mabel Taylor of As
toria, was the only attendant and was very
charming in a picture gown of quaint 1830
style, the pink flowered organdie adding to the
old-fashioned effect. She carried Bridesmaid
roses. Dr. , Baker tied the nuptial knot and
the groom was attended by Dr. C. F. Jarvls.
The decorations were very elaborate, the Im
mediate scene of the nuptials being made at
tractive with great, shaggy white chrysanthe
mums and St. Joseph lilies, while In the other
apartments red blossoms glowed vividly against
a background of green. .
The expense of putting up the new building
and remodeling the old will amount to more
than $12,000. Thl*. together with the various
charity wards which the hospital sustains, fur
ntshes a powerful incentive for the Fabiola la

Mrs. Barrows, mother of the young

day declined to discuss the affair, say

there Is no friction between her and

EXPLAINS WHY "AJAX"
HAD TO BE POSTPONED
Tp complete the versatility, of this
remarkable young woman, she is an
excellent musician and a clever chess

color and the brush becomes a heavy
weight she turns to chess for recrea
tion. . 'â¢_ -' â¢ .
Miss Wishaar considers figure paint
ing her forte, and judging from the
evidence she has given Oaklanders,
she is right. The tapestried walls of
the throne room and boudoir in the
exquisite setting given the "Hamlet"
production last week were unusually
beautiful, the cupid frieze of the one
and the portrait panels of the other
betraying < the real artist's skill. The
scenery for "Hamlet" was painted in
just eight days, a splendid feat when
all 'is -known.
The artist laughed : heartily^ over her
remembrance of tlfie dull picture 'into
which her work had faded.-
Peculiarly, Miss Wishaar's talent
sweeps over a wide range. Not only
li she an adept with the broad brush
and tricky "distemper" of the scene
painter, but she is even more skillful
with the tiny "camels hair" and oil of
the miniature artist. Her display of
miniatures at the last Starr King art
exhibit attracted much attention.
When seen to-day Miss Wishaar's
slender, girlish figure was enveloped In
a big blue apron profusely adorned
with smudges of paint, and as she
talked she continued to "lay in," with
sure hand, a Venetian setting for
"Frou Frou," next week's play.
"Yes," she said to answer to a ques
tion, "I love my work. It is progres
sive, there is room for originality, and
results are quick." Then, as a stroke
of brown paint here and there brought
pale spires into bold relief against the
brilliant blue of an Italian sky, she
continued: , ; .
I do with you would say something about the
medium I use. "People, generally, think that
scenery is painted with a whitewash brush
and that. some kind of a wash is used. But
the distemper with which I work is an opaque
water color. It Is delightfully effective, but
plays sad trick* sometimes on those unfamiliar
with Its vagaries. The first trick It played on
me was with a garden drop. I fairly reveled
In the delicious greens that ' paled and deep
ened under my brush, but when it dried! I
wiuh you could 'have wen it. Â¦'.'
That settled it, so far as Lee Lash
was concerned. Not discouraged
in the least by her rebuff, however.
Miss Wishaar went to D. Frank Dodge
of the Herald Square Theater. He
gave her a chance, though with little
faith in the experiment. Her success
was Immediate and she remained with
Mr. Dodge for several years. She also
assisted in painting the scenery of
many of- Proctor's famous productions.
Lee Lash, whose name is a familiar
one to every Californian artist, was,
at the time of Miss Wishaar's attend
ance there, her instructor in the San
Jose Art School. He is now in charge
of several scenic studios in-New York,
and "when his former pupil made up
her mind to invade territory hitherto
sacred to man. she naturally expected
and sought encouragement from her
erstwhile master. But, in the language
of the street, he coolly "turned her
down." He said that scene painting
was no work for a woman; that her
sex would make her unwelcome among
the workmen, and that women were
too "finicky" for work that demands
broad effects.
Although a native of New York Miss
Wishaar considers herself really a
California girl, as she came to this
State when very young, and it was
here that she received the impetus
that has at last placed her in a
unique position in the art world. She
began her studies in the San Jose Art
School and completed them in the
New York studio of William M. Chase,
the noted instructor.
Brown of eye and of hair, and sug
gesting less than medium height, Miss
Wishaar presents a dainty femininity
at variance with her occupation, which
has hitherto been considered essentially
masculine.
OAKLAND, Oct. 12. â Few patrons
of Ye Liberty Theater know that the
artist, Miss Grace Wishaar, who de
signs the mimic world in which the
players nightly live their storied lives,
is the only woman scene painter in the
world. More' than that, she is youngr,
very young, to have attained such dis
tinction. Preconceived notions of
what the only one of her kind in the
world should be immediately go glim
mering before the gentle charm of this
frail little woman.
Ekelund is employed by the Southern
Pacific Company and said that he had
to live in Oakland while his wife In
sisted upon- living in San Francisco.
She hated housework and insisted upon
doing the work of a stenographer and
having the remainder of the time In
which tojmrsue her literary tastes. She
had often said that she wished to go
to Japan and left without letting him
know when or where she was going.
I don't feel hard toward you. At the thought
of you tears come, but it is all over between
us as completely as though the grave held one
of us. '
God! when I think of the lonely nights I
spent In San Francisco, how I used to creep
into my bed and go to sleep at 7 o'clock that
I might forget how lonely I was and the
thanks I got â yes, they were showered upon
me â I sot so blue and de?sondent that even
Patsy and the srtrls eased to come to see me.
Now I am away and free as the air, and
Well, I want you to get a divorce. I think
it is the best, Charlie/ It would probably save
you much heartache later to be free. And I
desire it. I have some say in the matter, as
I once said "yes," bo now I will say "no,"
and I rest on your honor to release me. I tell
you frankly that I shall consider myself free
whether it goes through the law or not. and
I know it would be bÂ«st for us both. Yes, for
God's c<aks, Charles, end It. I won't keep your
name nfter that. I think It best not.
All thoughts of home -I've dropped from my
heart, and hereafter it's pot luck. God, man
nor the 'devil cares, and I am sure I don't.
The champague has an excellent flavor here,
and I am not one who, having come to the re
alization of a half-wasted life, will waste the
other half.
Dear Charles: Of course you know I am In
Yokohama. I've been here about two weeks.
Got offer of nosltlon and left within twelve
hours from i the time I heard of It. I got
tired of living as I was. J. tired of it all and
I saw that a complete change was the best.
If we had both realized It years ago Instead
of hanglnj on as we were, it would have
meant a much happier life for both of us.
After the way you adted in San Francisco
lately I realized more fully than ever how im
possible it was for us ever to live together and
be happy. You cared for me once and It was
different, but seeing how things drifted I left,
and here I am. and I'll not end here. I'm
going en and on, wherever the opportunity
offf-ra. ,
From the land of the chrysanthemum
a letter found its way into court to
day which gained a divorce for Charles
M. Ekelund. The missive ended aro
mance begun a few years ago. Kath
erine Ekelund, the defendant in the
suit, wrote the letter to her husband
which served as evidence and showed
that her love was but a remembrance.
With .determination to forget the past
she thus addressed her husband:

inquiries as rapidly as Is consistent
with a thorough investigation. Their
report will be used by the City Coun

After a general survey of the, situ-'

dally sessions at 4:30 o'clock at the
Mayor's office until the work of in
vestigating all of the water projects
has been completed.
At to-day's session M.'K. Miller pre
sented a statement or nis proposition
to establish- a water "plant at a cost
of $4,000,000. The committee decided
to take up George W. Dornin's pro
posal' at to-morrow's meeting. This
comprehends the, securing of a tract
of water bearing land in this county
at a cost of $150,000, with the construc
tion of pipe line and distributing sys
tem, all totaling $3,200,000, roughly es
timated.
.The. advisory, committee on a.muni

the City Council, organized this after
noon by selecting Mayor Warren Olney
as chairman and Councilman Edwin
Meese as secretary. Those who attend

Judge Samut.d dismissed the case.
This man did not tell me Mrs. Connesa was
bis sister-in-law, nor did he tell me that his
wife had prevented him from going Into the
hotiefe. So far as he Is concerned. I have been
informed by Mrs. Cano that her husband has
not earned f2u for a year and that she has
been compelled to work hard to support tho
home. This was why she locked him out.
Grave injustice has been done Mrs. Conness
and Cano simply tried to persecute her out of
reverse.

warrant before Prosecuting Attorney
Leach charging Mrs. Conness with dis
turbing his peace in that she had inter

had barred him out or nis own home,
and had tried to make trouble between
his wife and himself.
The Prosecuting Attorney was'aston
ished this morning when Mrs. Cano ap
peared in court as her sister's defender.
The wife and sister-in-law put a very
different aspect upon the case. They
declared that Cano had deliberately
deceived Leach, that he nad absolutely
no grounds for his complaint, that Mrs.
Cano had been the main obstacle in
the way when he tried to get Into the
house.
The Canp residence is at 1008 East
Sixteenth street. Cano said he went
home Monday night and could not get
in. Af^er accusing his sister-in-law of
objectionable interference he sought

ST. LOUIS, Oct. 12.â Before the In
ternational Congress of, Military Sur
geons to-day Major Louis Livingstone
Seaman, who has just returned from
the scene of the Russo-Japanese war,
delivered an address. He said in part:
"The Japanese authorities permitted
our Government to send five military
attaches to accompany their army in
the field. Was a surgeon or quarter
master or a commissary officer â¢ de
tailed? No. They represent the life
saving and life-preserving departments
and were omitted. The killing depart
ments, got the appointments, and to
day Japanese officers are laughing in
their sleeves at our senseless failure to
have representatives on what they con
sider their three vital points, while the
only weak, almost burlesque feature
of their army, its cavalry, Is consid
ered of sufficient importance to be
worthy of special study.
"But what can be expected of a Gov
ernment that after such terrible les
sons of 1898-99 still insisted, especially
in the tropics, in subsituting its army
on a raton so rich and elastic â lovely
term that, elastic â so elastic that when
in the emergency of war its elasticity
is tested it burots its bands and is
found to consist of pork and beans and
fermenting canned rubbish that in six
weeks prostrated 50 per cent of its
250,000 units with intestinal diseases
and sent 3000 to their last homes, to say
nothing of the enormous number in-Â»
valided and the 75,000 pension claims?
That In its famous reorganization fails
utterly to recognize one of the most
important of all the departments,
namely that of sanitation, as it is
recognized by the Japanese to-day?
That holds its great life-preserving de
partment in such light esteem that but
one officer in the entire army can ever
reach the rank and emoluments of a
brigadier general? That on its general
staff fails to have a single represen
tative of this department, and If any,
only a young. Inexperienced man of in
ferior rank, instead of the ablest and
most experienced officer in or out of the
service, one of internatonal reputation
like our retired surgeon general, Stern
berg."
Major Seaman assailed Congress for
abolishing the post canteen and said it
was time for this- association of mili
tary and naval surgeons to demand a
reorganization of the army which
would afford the medical branch equal
recognition with other branches of the
service.
Colonello Medico Pietro Imbraisco,
Royal Italian army, delivered an ad
dress upon "The Organization and Con
duct of the Sanitary Service of the
First Line in Modern War."
J. S. Leeds, general manager of the
Santa Fe refrigerator line, admitted
that his company paid rebates of $25 a
car on shipments from Northern Cali
fornia points in order to meet the com
petition of Armour. He said the SantA.
Fe refrigerator line, although officered
by the same men as the Santa Fe Rail
road Company, was not a common car
rier and that he proposed to continue
to make inducements for patronage as
long as conditions warranted.
CHICAGO, Oct. 12.â At to-day's ses
sion of the Interstate Commerce Com
mission, E. G. Davles of Chicago, a
commission merchant, testified that be
cause he would not pay alleged exor
bitant icing rates, the Armour Car
Company placed an embargo upon his ]
business. He testified that an agent j
of the company called him from his i
office and told him he might as well go !
out of business. He also said that they
threatened that no freight consigned j
by shippers would be received unless
all charges were paid in advance by the â¢
shippers. ]
The threat was carried out, Davies |
testified, and during last summer he j
said he received no shipments from the .
entire vegetable belt south of Cairo, 111.
Davies further testified that since the '
Armour refrigerator line had secured
an executive contract with the Pere
Marquette Railroad Company, compel
ling the growers and shippers of the
Michigan fruit belt to use Armour cars .
and pay Armour prices, rates have in- i
creased 416 2-3 per cent. j
"The shippers can either pay the un
reasonable prices demanded by Ar- I
mour," said Davies, "or let their fruit i
rot." . I
SALT LAKE CITY. Oct. 12.â At
the annual meeting of the stockhold
ers of the Oregon Short Line Railway,
held here to-day, the election of di
rectors was postponed until November
li. The reason for the unexpected
lÂ»O5tponc:nent could not be learned,
those present at the meeting refusing
to talk. The Oregon Short Line is a
part of the Harriman system and to
day's action, following the election to
the Union Pacific board of directors
yesterday of William G. Rockefeller
and Henry C. Frick. has caused con
siderable comment by local railroad
olfcials.
What makes the situation more in
teresting is the fact that the large
Harriman holdings of Xorthern Pa
cific stock are vested in the Oregon
Short Line corporation. It is the gen
erally expressed belief among local
railroad officials that the control of
the Union Pacific system has passed
from the Harriman to the Gould-
Rockefeller interests and that to-day's
postponement of the Oregon Short
Line directors election foreshadows
some exceedingly important changes
affecting the Western railway situa
tion.
There Is much interest expressed in
the possible effect the change in the
Union Pacific may have on the con
struction of the Western Pacific Rail
road from San Francisco to Salt Lake
City. This road was intended as a
Pacific Coast outlet for the Gould
lines.
This noon the street parade of the
Royal Foresters in their bright uni
forms attracted attention, and this
evening the Grand High Court ball was
given in Hotel Robinson. Very few re
ports are yet in from the grand officers
and it is not certain that the high
court will be able to finish its labors as
Intended, on Thursday evening.

THE VALUE OP CHARCOAL. |
Few People Know How Useful It Is in Pre-
serving Health and Beanty.
Nearly everybody knows that char-
coal is the safeFt and most efficient
disinfectant and purifier in nature, but
few realize its value when taken into
the human system for the same cleans-
iriff purpose.
Charcoal is a remedy that the more
you take of it the better; it is not a
drug: r.t all. but Fimply absorbs the
Eases and impurities always present
In the stomach and intestines and car-
ries them out of the system.
Charcoal sweetens the breath after I
rmokingv drinking: or after eating !
onions and other odorous vegetables.
Charcoal effectually clears and im- I
proves the complexion, it whitens the j
teeth and further acts as a natural '
and eminently safe cathartic
It absorbs the injurious grases which
collect in the stomach and bowels; It
disinfects the mouth and throat from
the poison of catarrh. .
AJJ druggists sell charcoal in one '
form or another, but probably the best |
charcoal and the most for the money is j
In Stuart** Charcoal Lozenges; they
a;e composed of the finest powdered
-v ilic.v charcoal, and other harmless
PTtiÂ«~ptics in tablet form or rather in
the form of large, pleasant tasting loz-
Â«-ngcF, the charcoal being: mixed with !
honey. '-.
The daily use of these lozenges will I
toon tell in a much improved condition |
of the general health, better complex- I
ion, sweeter breath and purer blood,
and the beauty of it is that no possible
harm can result from their continued ]
Use. but. on the contrary, great benefit, j
A Buffalo physician in speaking of i
the benefits of charcoal says: "I ad- j
vise Stuart's Charcoal Lozenges to all i
patients suffering from gas in stomach i
and bowels, and to clear the complex-
ion and purify the breath, mouth and
throat; I also believe the liver is great-
ly benefited by the dally use of them; Â¦
Ihey cost but twenty-five cents a box at
Srug stores, and although in some sense
a patent preparation, yet I believe I
ret more and better charcoal In Stuart's
Charcoal Lozenges than in any of the
ordinary charcoal tablets."

"When a person has been told that
they are in the last stages of consump-
tion, and that no treatment can help
them, it is surely a wonderful relief,
both physically and mentally, to find a
treatment that has curative effects. My
condition was a very serious one, and
all the medical treatment that I used did
me no good. I heard of the success of
Electro-Chemistry in- serious diseases
like my own, and I went to the Electro-
Chemic Institute, No. 118 Grant ave.. for
a careful examination. This examination
was free and it was so thorough that I
had great hopes when the Electro-Chem- â¢
lc specialists told me that Electro-Chem-
istry would cure me. I began the treat-
ment immediately, and in a short <time
my condition was jrreatly improved in
every way. When I first went to the In-
stitute my breathing was so short that I
could hardly go up the stairs. I had a
veYy serious cough and I expectorated
horrible looking matter from my lungs.
I had fever in the afternoons and had
night sweats. I had lost a great deal of
flesh and was so weak that J could
scarcely get about. I feel like a new wo-
man now. I feel stronger In every way.
The cough has disappeared. The night
sweats and the afternoon fÂ«vers have
disappeared. I do not expectorate bad
looking matter from my lungs, and all of
this has been accomplished in a -very
short time and at very little expense. I
feel it my duty to tell other sufferers of
the wonderful effects of Electro-Chemis-
try in bad cases like my own. My name
is Mrs. M. Macdougall and I live at No
400 Oak st. San Francisco. **
It is cures like these that is making
the Electro-Chemic treatment famous,
and it is because of such cures that ia
less than three years' time the Electro-
Chemic practice in San Francisco has
become the largest special practice in
the "West. Electro-Chemistry is curative â¢
In all longr-standlng and chronic diseases
and it Is. the most successful treatment
yet discovered for the cure of Consump-
tion. Catarrh. Bronchitis. Asthma. Deaf-
ness. Ringing Ears. Discharging Ears.
Painful Ears. Rheumatism. Xeural-

The Electro-Chemic X-Ray Examina-
tion is the most reliable examination that
any sufferer can have and it is absolute-
ly free to all. Patients living at a dis-
tance should try to come to the office for
this examination. In most cases the pa-
tient can take the course of Electro-
Chemic home treatment and return home
the same day. An' expensive Electro-
Chemic apparatus is loaned to outside
patients, free of charge. The Institute
is provided with separate and private
apartments for its male and female pa-
tients and everything is retired, quiet
and pleasant. All classes are now taking
the Electro-Chemic course. There are
lawyers. ministers. priests, physi-

SHIP SUBSIDIES AND NATIONAL NEEDS.'
1000 Tars Climb Ben Xevis.
While the vessels of the Channel
squadron were anchored in Dochs Lin
nie' and Leven, says the London Ex
press, a naval invasion of Scotland's
highest mountain was organized.
A thousand sailors landed at Fort
Â¦William, and decided to climb Ben
Nevis, the ridges of which soon swarm
ed with bluejackets.
Spectators at a distance who saw the
blue-covered mountain thought they
were witnessing some strange atmos
pherical phenomenon.
"A SKYSCRAPER."
THE question of ship subsidies and the protection of our ocean
carrying trade is likely to come once more to the front, sus
tained and strengthened by the period of national reflection
through which it has passed. The enormous interests involved have
been neither noisy nor clamorous, although it would be safe to say
that they have now become the interests of the whole country,
which has quietly awakened to the magnitude of the need.
However quickly the question is now faced, there can be no
accusation of hasty legislation nor of immature action. The matter
has been abundantly debated in Congress and the measure favorably
reported for passage upon two occasions. It received the implied
apprqwaj of President McKinley, as well as the support of hundreds
of commercial bodies, whose position for accurate and responsible
judgment is unequaled. The verdict of the business section of the
country has been delivered, and it now only remains for the Legis
lature to carry that verdict into effect.
In the meantime loss to the country goes on day by day. In 1861
America was the commercial mistress of the sea. That she no longer
occupies that position should be an incentive to the only action
which can restore her to her proper place. It is a matter, not of
party, but of patriotism.
The arguments in favor of a ship subsidy measure are so fresh
in the public mind that their repetition would be almost super
erogatory. It is simply a matter of common knowledge that an im
mense quantity of American freight is now being carried in foreign
ships, and that a vast sum of money paid for transport goes into
foreign pockets, and for the support of merchant marines which are
not American and which might- conceivably become aggressively and
militantly anti-American. That is not a matter which we ought to
view with equanimity, especially since the experiences of the Spanish
war so conclusively demonstrated the extent to which swift mer
chantmen might become an arm of national defense and a means of
national preservation.
A subsidized merchant service means the establishment of trade
routes and a compulsorily regular and rapid service. The quick de
livery of goods lubricates the machinery of commerce to an extent
which is not perhaps sufficiently understood, and it would therefore
be well for Chambers of Commerce and other bodies of a like na
ture to make themselves audible on a matter which lies so close to
the mainspring of business progress.

out this adornment), while at the left
a mole colored plume shows a snow

PRETTY OPERA BAGS.
AT last the Democratic campaign textbook is out. It will be
remembered that this is the document which Judge Parker
begged should be expurgated before publication. It consists
of three hundred and fifty-four page/> of text, requiring eight pages
of index, 3nd exhibits the names and addresses of National and State
committeemen on four pages more.
This book begins with the constitution of the United States set
forth in full. This is an exhibit to prove the specifications to be
found further on in the speeches of Hitchcock, the Nebraska Popu
iist, and of Livingston of Georgia, Culberson of Texas, John Sharp
Williams of Mississippi and Champ Clark of Missouri. They all ac
cuse President Roosevelt of violating the constitution and therefore
of being a perjurer, a traitor and a criminal. This gross and out
rageous charge runs through the whole book. A discussion of the
tariff appears fitfully here and there and the Philippines are re
ferred to, but the compiler returns again and again to the personal
charge against the President. He is accused of not only violating
the constitution in domestic matters but of perjury in international
affairs. He is charged with intending, of his own, motion, to make
war abroad and involve the country in a sea of troubles to satisfy the
malevolent cravings of his criminal disposition.
In this respect this Democratic campaign textbook is a disgrace
to the country. President Roosevelt has visited every section of the
Union. He has met socially and officially gentlemen of all parties
everywhere, and their judgment of him is expressed by the speech of
John Sparks, Democratic Governor of Nevada, introducing the Pres
ident to an audience in Carson City, when he said: "I introduce the
President of the United States, a true American and an honest man,
whom all the money in the world cannot buy." That was the senti
ment of a patriot on an occasion when a political opponent could
afford to tell the truth.
Looking further into this campaign textbook it is seen that the
Southern politicians are making the issues that it sets forth. They
are alarmed about the constitution. They are calling upon the North
to join them in defending the fundamental law. They are supersen
sitive lest a line or a letter of that sacred instrument shall fail to be
properly respected. They are the accusers of the President â John
Sharp Williams, Champ Clark, Benjamin Tillman and Charles A.
Culberson ; Mississippi, Missouri, South Carolina and Texas accuse
the President of the United States of being a perjurer, a traitor and
a criminal!
The last article of the constitution of the United States, as it ap
pears on page 15 of this textbook, says: "The right of citizens
of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the
United States, or by any State on account of race, color or previous
condition of servitude." On the same page, section 2 of article
XIV of the constitution says: "When the right to vote * * '*
to any of the male members of such State, being 21 years of age and
citizens of the United States, is denied, except for crime, the basis of
representation therein shall be reduced in the proportion which the
number of such male citizens shall bear to the whole number of
male citizens 21 years of age in such State."
The section of the country represented by these accusers of
the President violates and defies both of these constitutional pro
visions. Mississippi, Alabama and South Carolina would give their
thirty electoral votes to President Roosevelt if the constitution were
in force in those States. If it were not violated by continuing to
count the negroes, denied the right to vote on account of race, in
the basis of representation, the Southern Democracy, instead of 160
votes in the Electoral College for President, would have 100 only.
The sole hope of Judge Parker for election lies in the casting of
sixty illegal and unconstitutional electoral votes from the South, and
in persuading the Northern people that President Roosevelt has vio
lated the constitution, and therefore they should join the South in
defeating him.
Let it be remembered that Republicans have no desire to force
negro rule upon any Southern State. But the spirit of the North
rebels when the South denies the franchise to negroes but continues
to count them in the electoral vote, thereby violating* the constitu
tion in its most important features. Tillman, Bailey. Williams and
Champ Clark are in the North making speeches for Parker. They
are heard patiently and travel without molestation. What would
happen to Dolliver, Fairbanks or Shaw if they should go South and
truthfully charge the Southern people with trying to steal the Presi
dency, by using sixty illegal and unconstitutional electoral votes?-

was $26,789,057 07: freight earnings,
J49.043.S14 31, and other earnings
51,165.465, aggregating $76,998,396 38,
or a gross increase over 1902 of $11,

The total expenses of all roads in

$4,023,070 94. The report says that
in the total number of accidents on
the various roads 329 were killed and
1772 injured, as against the previous
year's record of 226 killed and 1227
injured. About 98 miles of new road
was built during the year and no ma
terial changes were made in freight
or passenger rates.
The fact that no complaints were
received by the board during 1903 Is
referred to by the commission as a
pleasing indication that the relations
between California shippers and the
various transportation companies
were amicable.

FTLES ANSTJAIi REPORT
Clever Comedian, Unknown to tho
Members of Ills Company, Quietly
Marries Miss Slaughter.
Philip H. Ryley, the clever comedian
of '"The Tenderfoot," now playing at
the California Theater, surprised the
members of the company by getting
married at noon yesterday. Pretty
Miss Daisy Leighton Slaughter, one of
the show girls of the company, con
tributed the other part to the quiet
wedding. They were married by Rev.
Father Prendergast of St. Mary's Ca
thedral. Mr. and Mrs. Romain played
the second part.
Ryley and his bride have been to
gether for several years. Miss Slaugh
ter, whose stage name is Daisy Leigh
ton, was one of the original Florodora
girls that made such a hit in San
Francisco. She is a tall, handsome
brunette, and has a statuesque form
that wants no feminine charm.' There
has-been a feeling for each other be
tween the two for many months, and
It has been whispered among the
members of the company that San
Francisco was the place where the
event was coming off. When Miss
Slaughter showed a large solitaire dia
mond her fellow members grew sus
picious, but were not aware it was go
ing to happen so soon.
The charming bride did not appear
in her usual role last evening. She
occupied a box at the theater, and
the members of the company kept
their eyes on her throughout the per
formance, and Ryley was the recipient
of congratulations from his many
friends in San Francisco.
After the marriage ceremony was
performed the couple drove to the Cliff
House, where a dinner was served.
Living up to a name Is a difficult and a great
achievement. Making a new one Is greater.
"Old OUt Edge Whiekey" made a new name so
long ago that it is now able to live up to it as
an old, old one. â¢
FRENCH 8AILOR CONVICTED.â Jules le

gust 14 he cut Francois Cochard four times
with a knife at 17 Jackson street, where both
were rooming. He will be sentenced to-mor
row.

SENTENCED FOR GRAND LARCENY.â
Harry J. Rose, convicted of grand larceny by
a jury In Judge Lawlor's court, was sentenced
yesterday to serve three years In Folsom pent,
tentlary. On August 7 he stole a watch and
rob from William Armstrong of Mare Island.
MIXLIP RYL.EY MARRIES
A PRETTY SHOW GIRL
CLEVER SOCIETY WOMAN WHO
PLAYED A LEADING ROLE IN
BROWNING DRAMA.
The readings of Mrs. Ralph C. Harri
son and Mrs. B. F. Norris were given
with a feeling born of intimacy with
the prose-poet and his sweetheart.
Following the intermission came the
piece de resistance to the sound of
sweet music from afarâ the play. Now,
a Browning play is a thing apart from
the plays of the workaday world, for
they stand for mental rather than
physical actionâ and therein lies one
bar to the popularity of the Browning
plays. But ye who scoff would have
remained to pray had ye heard the in
terpretation as given last night by am
ateurs â scornful word, but true â but
in truth, lovers of the lines they spoke.
With a little shallow stage furnished
with a pair of Ionic columns sliced in
two, a table with a bunch of blossoms,
a piano, a settee and a curtained cor
ner, with these puny accessories Mrs.
Max C. SIoss, her beautiful rival. Miss
Grace Llewellyn Jones, and their lover,
Lloyd Lowndes, carried the play
through three-quarters of an hour
without a moment's cessation of In
terestâfrom before the footlights.
Pretty to look upon in her glistening
rcbes and ropes of pearls, Miss Jones
proved herself a seductive sweetheart-
So. too, did Mrs. Sloss, in her regal
robes of blue, look the queen-lover that
Flic was, and act it, too. Norbett, un
lucky wight, loved alike by queen and
maid, was clever â mighty clever, in a
mighty hard role. In all, 'twas a pity
Ben Greet didn't see it â and others who
know their Browning.
To the Browning Club congratula
tions!
To the clever actor-folk, more of
them, and may it not be long before
another play of mental action be given
us.
Besides, the Brownings are needed
now. As an antidote for divorce I
know no better pabulum.
The audience? Smartly gowned. In
terested, and therefore appreciative. ,
But why. oh why, will women' with
rustling taffeta flutter about from room
to room. -Just at a psychological mo
ment? .
As always, S. Homer Henley's num
bers were rendered in fetching fashion,
his numbers sharing honors with the
songs of a pretty maid with a rose
wreath in her hairâ Miss Helen Col
burn Heath.

If Ben Greetâ the apostle of the sup
posedly impossible in dramatic art
had only been at Century Hall last
night there's no telling but that a
Browning play would be his next ar
tistic resurrection. Stranger things than
that have come to pass in these re
generate days. And it all came about
thus: Last night the Browning Club,
Mrs. Frank Oulton president, offered
a feast in song and story to its friends.
It presented the "divine lovers" in all
the moods they knew and through all
the intricacies of that famous love that
wrought the sweetest songs of the
heart ever fflven to man.
JAPANESE COMMITS SUICIDE.â Georse. a
Japanese cook employed In the family of P.
Lirpitt at 1759 Broadway, killed himself last
Tuesday night by cutting his throat with a
razor. His body was found on the floor of his
room at 8 o'clock yesterday morning. The razor
and a knife were found lying beside the body
and the door was looked on the Inside. He
had been acting queerly for several days.
ATTACKED BY DIVORCED "WIFE.âAn
tone Fritz, . 23 Sliver place, secured a warrant
from Police Judge Cabanlss yesterday for the
arrest of Lottie Herman, his divorced wife, on
a charge of battery. Fritz said that he and
his present wife went to the Central Theater
on Tuesday nicht and as he entered the door
Lottie confronted him and struck him a severe
blow on the jaw. She raised such a disturb
ance that a special officer had to put her out.

"My own experience Is a good ex
ample of what small influence the re
viewers exert," said Mrs. Atherton, her
voice not being altogether without a
prleeful note. "Every work of mine has
been adversely criticized by them and
yet the sales are steadily Increasing
and becoming very gratifying."
"I really have done no work shjcÂ«
"The Ruler? of Kings' was finished,"
said Mrs. Atherton. "I have no definite
plans for the future and must confess
that I am in an unusual state of inde
cision. I have always had only one
book in mind at a time, heretofore, but
now I have five or six. The result Is
demoralizing. I can't decide which to
take up."
London's "Call of the Wild" was de-
BcribHl as "wonderful"; Norris* "Mc-
Teafrue" as "remarkable." But there
were no other writers of the West who
had made much of an impression on
Mrs. Atherton. "Oh. yes, there is Mr.
Bierce, his short stories," she said sud
denly, in trying to conjure up the
names of Westerners who seek fame
an<3 profit with the pen.
Henry James engages a hiprh opinion
and Mrs. Atherton repards "The Em
bassadors" as an exceptionally strong
bock. Henry James and Mark Twain
stand pre-eminent, in her Judgment, as
the fiction writers of the day. No
American writers of the past will over-
Fhadow them when the future has
taken its perspective. "They crack up
Hawthorne," declared Mrs. Atherton,
"but he had the field to himself and
would not maintain the race if writing
with the many strong men of the pres
ent day."
Mr?. Gertrude Ath^-ton, fresh with
the laurels of distinct achievement in
her latest book, 'â¢The Rulers of Kings,"
arrived in San Francisco Tuesday
evening:, almost direct from Munich,
Germany, hrr present home, for a two
months' stay In California. She was
rtill fatigued last night from her long
journey, but her stay of two years in
Europe has not told on her charm and
buoyancy of spirit.
There has been much of delightful
exjx^tarcy over the reports that Mrs.
Atherton was seeking beloved Califor
nia for inspiration In a new literary
effort. But she does not pive the seri
ous import to her visit that has been
intimated. It is nothing more than a
novelette that she has In mind and
there is a preat dÂ«Â»aJ of Indecision about
that. She has not thought out any
plan of story, is uncertain as to which
of two suggestions 5he shall take up
and will not give up more than a
mnnth to writing it. It is to be pub
lteh^d in Smart Set
The other rrecious month is to be
pper.t amons relatives and friends In
this city. Away from San Francisco
ehe has grown for.der of It and free
from her work she will enjoy its store
of friendship for her. Then she will
FP^k some quiet place in the northern
Tart of the State â she has not chosen
the spot yetâ to undertake the novel
ette.

Mrs. Gertrude Atherton Is
Again in San Francisco
After Two Years' Absence
The wedding of Miss Bella Gerstle
and Mortimer Fleishhacker took place
yesterday at high noon at the bride's
beautiful home in San Rafael, and
was in all truth, of note, uniting as
it did two families closely identified
with the upbuilding of San Francisco.
The bride, in an exquisite robe of
heavy white satin, was attended by
eight brldesmaldB, who, In white frocks,
girdled with yellow and wearing huge
lace hats, formed a proud processional.
In this picturesque train were Miss
Mack, maid of honor. Miss Hecht, Miss
Levison, Miss Greenbaum, Miss Joseph,
Miss Frank, Miss Lilienthal and Miss
Rosenbaum.
Out on the lawn a pavilion had, been
erectedâ a bridal bower among the
trees, with the blossoms flaming from
every bush.
To this fairy bower the attendants
proceeded, the fair bride following.
Here they were awaited by Rabbi
Voorsanger, the groom- and his best
man, Edward Schussler. To the soft
strains of the organ, responses were
read. Surely In no lovelier spot in all the
world was ever love's pledge plighted.
The nuptial breakfast was served on
the tennis court, carpeted and canopied
and banked with brakes and redwood
branches at every pillar. And to the
trees, the grass, the flowersâ to the fair
bride herselfâ the sun sent down his
warm caresses and sweet was the air
with the perfume of a thousand blos
soms.
About seventy-flve guests were gath
ered to witness the affair, many com
ing from afar to bid godspeed to the
happy pair.
A nuptial trip will keep the young
i people abroad, for a year.

Although the Supervisors aver that
it will be impossible for the Shasta
Club or for any" other club to secure
a boxing permit, the promoters of the
Britt-Gans fight are going right ahead
and making ready to hold the contest.
Last night Manager James W. Cof
froth of the Shasta Club and his as
sociates smiled when questioned about
the permit and then added that the
prospects of securing it were brighter
than at any other time.
They are going right ahead and
making arrangements to hold the fight
just as though the permit was already
stowed away in Mr. Coffroth's pocket.
Advertising matter is being distribut
ed, the boxers are beginning to work
out, the prices of seats have been an
nounced, and altogether trie promoters
appear sanguine of success.
Al. Herford, Gans' manager, ported
the $2500 forfeit yesterday with Har
ry Corbett, the club's stakeholder.
Coffroth also put up the club's coin.
Willie Britt ' said he would be there
with his wad this afternoon. The
promoters think when Â« the forfeit
money is up the general public will
become more interested, and that the
way for the fight will be even more
smoothly paved. ,

granted Coffroth. lie is willing to

money will be divided as agreed upon
by the principals, bnt it is a two to one
bet that Brltt will not get such terms
as his contract in this city calls for.
Gans went over to Shannon's villa,
near San Rafael, yesterday morning
to begin work. He expects to be close
to weight in a few days and thinks the
warm climate of Marin County will be
of benefit to him In making the weight.
Herford will watch his colored won

nificently fielded by Hilde
brand hit to Devereaux and a pretty
double play was made. 'WValdron con- j
rected for a hummer to left and Meany
drove one squarely through to center.
Kruger got the jimmies and after doing
a bit of fancy juggling hurled the ball
away at third, letting Waldron score.
Pat pulled up at second and as soon
as Cap Irwin smashed a wicked one
o^it to right he tore homeward. Gan
ley's whip was not accurate and Pat
managed to slide under the throw clev
erly. Jimmy Byrnes was saying mean
things about fate when the umpire
butted in and called Meany out- It
looked palpably wrong and created a
whole lot of discussion, but it went all
the same.
The Commuters made something of
a rally in their half of the eighth. One
was down when Schlafley landed for a
double and Kruger got a life on Goch
r.auer's boot. A double steal was then
pulled off and Larry reached the pan
In safety, Krugrer going to second. Dev

"I have nev^er discussed fighting mat
ters outside of the board's meetings.
Of course we all know that Coffroth
was strongly opposed to our side in the
primary elections and did not stop at
any means- to overthrow the McNab
faction. I think sports should be con
ducted on a pure basis and it is cer
tain they have not been so con
ducted."
The Police Committee Is scheduled to
meet this afternoon" to act on the ap
plication of the Shasta Club. Super
visor Boxton has already said he. will
not vote to grant the permit and if Mc-
Clellan stands with his Democratic col
leagues against Coffroth, Eggers will
be the only* Supervisor to vote in favor
and the matter will thus die in the
committee. In the meantime Manager
Coffroth . Is proceeding with his ar
rangements for the fight. 'He contends
that, having complied with the law re
garding his license, he does not require
a special sanction from the Supervisors.
Judging from remarks dropped yes
terday by Supervisors Braunhart and
Connor It seems the Shasta Club will
not be granted a permit for a profes
sional boxing contest this month, nor
will any more permits be granted in the
future. The question of whether of not
the club would be given the permit was
brought up informally at the close of
the meeting of the Supervisors' Street
Committee. The Supervisors named
were asked whether they would vote to
grant the permit.
"I do not.care to say how I will rote,
as I am not a member of the Police
Committee, in whose hands the appli
cation now rests." said Braunhart. "I
must say, though, I consider It
impudent on the part of the fight pro
moters to make their arrangements for
the Britt-Gans fight without first hav
ing obtained the necessary authority.
Further, It seems to me that the sec
retary of the Superior Judges should
not be engaged'in the fighting business.
It is a fact that all those engaged in
the fighting business are our opponents
politically."
Evidently the animus of the Super
visors is directed against James W.
Coffroth,' for Supervisor Connor was
even more outspoken against Coffroth
than Braunhart. He berated him In
violent terms, but asked that what he
said be not published. Continuing,
Connor said:
Multnomah played steadily and ar
rested line plunges In their inclpiency.
The visitors easily broke through when
Stanford had the ball. The cardinal
held well on the defensive, but seemed
content with that. Multnomah made
two big gains by passing the ball to an
end drawn back and sending him
through on his own side. The Stan
ford players on these occasions watched
the bunch of men instead of the pig
skin and unless they reform in this re
spect they are likely to have some ex
pensive tricks played on them before
the season Is over.
In spite of the recent bad showing
of the eleven, the cardinal remembers
what wor-Iers Lanagan accomplished
last year in the last weeks of the sea
son and the determination to hand
something good to California next No
vember Is not a whit diminished.
James Edward Brltt, boxer, was
present yesterday and remarked "dat
graft lays all over prize flghtin' for
croolty. A feller Is thrown down, den
eleven udder guys punch him and
twenty-two more of 'em kick 'im In
de face."
Stanford kicked forty yards to Mult
nomah on the start. The visitors fum
bled and lost the ball on the first play.
Trowbrldge and Weller made light gains
and then Stott ran around the visitors'
left end and passed the goal line. Some
one of the cardinal had held in the line,
however, and the ball went back fifteen
yards. Stanford failed to gain and was
forced to kick.
After a skirmish Coates punted the
pigskin to the center of the field again.
Stanford fumbled, but Multnomah
failed to gain its distance, and Coates
The football game between Stanford
and the Multnomah Athletic Club of
Portland at Palo Alto yesterday ended
In a tle^ much to the discomfiture of
the cardinal and to the delight of the
visitors. The contest lacked spirit after
the first ten minutes of play and the
men en both teams were exceedingly
careless In their work. The field was
in excellent condition. There were but
few gains of any considerable length
except on trick plays. The attendance
was Email and enthusiasm was num
bered with the missing.
Stanford had every right to win, but
her men fumbled, played offside, held
in the line, ran toward their own goal
poets with the ball and did about
everything else that should not be done
In the game. "Jim" Lanagan was
ar.gry at his disobedient pupils and he
had excellent cause for his wrath.
Stanford, as she played yesterday,
could net beat California between now
and the arrival of the next glacial
period.
The cardinal had Just one play that
vas good for a gain. The tackle is
boxed, the end is bowled out and the
half comes through with his friends
there to push him along. Big Jim Wel
ler made a yard or two on line bucks,
but none of the other plays seemed to
work. Stott tried the quarterback run
on numerous occasions, but lost from
three to eight yards every time. Cali
fornia is already working to stop the
outside-of-tackle play and by the time
of the big game will probably play the
tackle out, Yale fashion, and give the
cardinal a bitter disappointment in this
respect.
Present Indications Show
That Application Will Die
in the Police Committee
again punted up the gridiron toward
the enemy's goal. The outslde-of
tackle'play on both sides of the line
was successful In bringing the pigskin
twenty yards Into Multnomah terri
tory. Then the visitors worked back a
few yards by excelling in punting and
cutting off Stott in his quarterback
runs, for which he kept signaling.
Multnomah gained forty-five yards
just before the close of the half on their
patent end run. Coates made a pitiful
attempt at a field goal Just before the
referee sounded his whistle.
During the second half Stanford fum
bled and was penalized. repeatedly. Not
to be outdone on these fine points of the
game t the visitors did likewise. When
ever it began to look like a touchdown
the team with the pigskin would give
away its advantage Just to show that
nothing serious was Intended. The con
test ended with the ball In the center
of the field.
Several Multnomah men were laid
out during the contest. Lanagan
switched his pupils frequently, so that
a good many men were In the game.

MORRIS PARK. Oct. 12.â A compar
atively small number of spectators saw
the Champagne Stakes won by G. G.
Greener's Tennessee bred colt. Oiseau,
to-day, but few who saw Lyne's ride
on Tradition were satisfied that the
best horse won. Almost from the start
Oiseau held the lead. Tradition took
second , place coming around Into the
stretch, the race being run over seven
furlongs of the Withers mile-
All the way down the home stretch
the onlookers expected to see a really
strong call made by Lyne on Tradi
tion, but they were not satisfied with
his efforts. At the last furlong pole
his reins slipped through his fingers
and when he tried to use his whip it
was in a feeble sort of a way that
aroused' the excited partisans of the
filly to shout to the Jockey: "Why
don't you hit her hard?"
Odom, on Oiseau, was not anxious
until the last fifty yards.then he be
gan to rid* hard. Tradition, despite
the weak and inefficient handling she
received, was gaining on Oiseau and
finished with her nose- at the colt's
quarters. There was an almost unan
imously expressed opinion among good
judges that the race did not at all
prove that Oiseau Is better than Tra
dition. The. two met at even weights,
sex considered. The third colt, Pasa
dena, an added starter, ran well
throughout, but was outclassed. Sum

The board recommended that the
sidewalks on the southerly side of Ful
ton street, from Sixth ayenue to the
great highway, be dispensed with and
abolished and those on the northerly
side be fixed at designated widths.
Ford stated that no prudent company t
could entertain the proposition, as it I
would result in congested traffic
The board adopted a resolution re- {
Questing of the Civil Service Commission |
that M. A. Fraser. a clerk, and George
Robertson, a messenger, be dismissed i
from the service and removed from the }
eligible lists, because of continued ab- f
sence without leave. L. D. Slcss and [
F. Myer were appointed clerks from the >
eligible Ii3t.
The application of Peter McHugh for (
an extension of time on his contract "
to repave Jackson street, between j
Cherry and First avenue, was denied, i
as his permit has expired. He was ;
told to file a new application, and the I
board again took occasion to take dila- [
tory contractors to task, saying the de- I
partment was criticized for their t
dalays, which would not be tolerated in
future.
I*. Mery was appointed draughtsman
at $115 per month.
The City Engineer submitted a map
showing the boundaries of the district t
to be assessed for the changes of grade |
on Seventh and other streets along the ,
right of way of the Southern Pacific j
Company for its bay shore cut-off line. .
The damages to the Iot3 and improve- 31 *

change will aggregate |50.*Â», the work {

The board rejected the claim of j
Joseph Baruh for Jill 25 damages to |
his hack from falling into a side sewer j
trench on McAllister street, near!
Steiner, as Deputy Donovan reported j
that lamps were placed at the point j
when the accident happened.
Deputy Donovan reported it would j
cost J330 to prevent the sewer on Ful- j

from overflowing.

pared yesterday to recommend to the
Board of Supervisors that the United
Railroads b"e permitted to reset the
double track curve at Post and Kearny
streets so that it will be - eighz feet
from the sidewalk instead of five feet.
Protest was filed by the Pacific Rsalty
Company, which owns property at the
corner, against the proposal to cat
down the curb by nearly two feet-
Tirey L. Ford, attorney ror the corpor
ation, wanted action taken at once, but
the board decided to consider the mat
ter this morning at 11:30 o'clock.
City Engineer Woodward filed a re
port stating that he Is not in favor
of cutting down the- sidewalk width at
the point named aod suggested the
adoption of another plan as follows:
It was stated In the committee that
the Board of Works had advertised for
bids for the widening and paving of
Fourth street without the Board of Su
pervisors having authorized the work.
Chairman Connor stated that he did
not think contractors would bid on tha
work in view of the fact that the char
ter had been Tlolated. but the commit
tee decided to order the work done.
A protest was filed by Henry A.
Crane and Anna Jocst against the clos
ing of any streets ia the district ex
tending from. Twenty-fourth avenue
South to the northerly line of the Paul
Tract. The Southern Pacific Ccmpany
desired to close > the Â«treej3 in return
for the conveyance of a strip of land
sucty feet wide running along Its right
of way from Twenty-fourth avenue
South to Twenty-seventh avencs South,
to be dedicated as a public street. The
protest was withdrawn after the rail
road officials agreed to modify its con
veyance so that the company will npc
be - compelled to maintain any grad*
crossings between the points named,
but shall cot close any street3 in the
Paul Tract.
Jere Burke wanted the committee
to take ap the matter of a franchis-s
through Islais Creek, but the commute*
refused t8 <io so. as the application for
a franchise for a steam railroad
through the Mission, district and for a
railroad along Islais Creek* was denied

The Supervisors* Street Committee
yesterday recommended far passaÂ£3
two ordinances submitted by the Mar

eraiion of sidewalk, elevators. The or
dinances provide that the outer edgea
of the openinsr shall be not morÂ» than

the length and width shall not exceed
seven and five feet. It is also provided
that the elevator shall bÂ« equipped with
a device which wiu prevent the plat

than five feet of the sidewalk doors
when they are closed. It is made un
lawful for any one but a responsible
person to open such, doors by hand

The doors may only be opened during
the time of receipt or delivery of mer

forward to Saturday next, when the

track will be fun off, with the permis

petite of the reinsmen and the San

cipating: an even larger attendance at
the closing majinee than would have
been drawn last Saturday. Better time
is sure to result from the downpour as
the track will be in perfect condition

GREYHOUNDS TO COURSE
The members of the San Francisco
Model Yacht Club met last night and
some Important business was trans
acted, Secretary Genungr's protest in
regard to the cup race held on the 2d
instant will be decided Sunday morn-
Ing. There were two grounds of pro
test. The first was in regard to the
time limit . for the course. Genung
claimed that the course was longer
than the official measurer figured, in
which case his model, the Witch,
came within the time limit. The Witch
was disqualified. The second ground
of protest was that the races were not
run off as scheduled.
The committee decided that the
ccurse would have to be remeasured.
Commodore Collier appointed Messrs.
Adams, Brannon and Roeckner a com
mittee to measure the course Sunday
morning. If the course is found to be
longer than 650 feet the races for the
cup will have to be sailed again. If
the course measures under 650 feet the
races will stand and the finals will be
run off Sunday afternoon.
Genung resigned from the regatta
committee and McCleary was appoint
ed to succeed him.
Secretary Gcnung Protests Against the
Decision Rendered in Cup Race

"The great demand for flour from North
Pacific mills to go East is keeping up and
every mill is taxed to its capacity In filling
orders and a great many have orders on hand
to keep them running twenty- four hours per

mand exists from Europe and South Africa,
and notwithstanding the" extra duty put on
by Japan for a war revenue, orders are com
ing freely for future delivery. China Is not
buying so freely as heretofore, as present
prices are too high for It to stock up with.
California Is also buying heavily of North

Receipts of most kinds of fresh fruits were
light and the market generally had a steady
tone. The regular local trade was stimu
lated by the warm, sunny weather and there
was a fair Inquiry for shipment on the Puget
Sound steamer. Table Grapes in crates were
wanted for shipment, and suitable lots of all
varieties cleaned up readily at prices ranging
from 60c to 75c per crate. Small and open
boxes were steady for good stork, while poor
lots dragged at Irregular prices. OffÂ«rlngs of
Peaches were limited and Included some fancy
stock from cold storage, which met with ready
sale at or near the top quotation. All dealers
reported a firm and active market for good
Apples but there was no noticeable Improve
ment in prices. The other deciduous fruits
were In good request at about previous prices.
Raspberries and Strawberries In good condi
tion met with prompt sale at good figures,
while Cranberries ruled weak at the recently

CHICAGO, Oct. 12.â Curtailment of receipts
in the Southwest was the main cause of a
strong market here to-day in wheat. Both
December and May closed with a gain of l%c.
Corn is up lV4c. Oats are up a shade. Pro
visions are off 15c to 32%c. â¢
As a result of higher prices In foreign grain
markets wheat at the opening here was wanted
in considerable quantities at some Improvement
In price over yesterday's closing figures. The
December option was unchanged to He higher
at $1 09 to $1 09v;, while May was %&\i.c
lower to a shade higher at $1 O9V4, to $1 09%.
As soon, however, as the first .batch ot buying
orders had been filled It was found that sellers
were still numerous and an easier tone devel-
C}>ed. After touching $1 00H@l 00%, Decem
ber declined to $1 OS?*. May sold up to $1 00%'
Â©1 00% and then reacted to $1 09@l Â«>%. Cable
news waa not very reassuring to bull trad
ers. It was reported from Liverpool that re
cent Continental buyers of white wheat car
goes were offering to resell. It was â¢ likewise
stated that rain had relieved to some. extent
the drought in New South Wales. Later, nev
ertheless, the market here had a revival of
bulliphness when it was seen how small had
become the movement of winter wheat In the
Southwest. Reports from St. Louis and KaiÂ»
saÂ« City Indicated a decided falling off In ar
rivals, the decrease being of sufficient quantity
to offset the liberal receipts In the Northwest.
An advance of 5e a bushel from the price of
cash wheat at Kansas City was , an influential
factor in speculative trading here late in the
day. Buying by belated tCiorts was also a
feature of late trading. The market continued
to gain in strength until the clone, final quo
tations being practically at the highest point
of the day. After touching $1 10%, December
doped at ?1 10%.
May sold up to $111 and closed at ?1 10%.
An Inclination to drag was manifested In the
corn market early In the day. Later, however,
on gocd buying by commission houses and
local bull?, sentiment became quite bullish.
ThÂ» market closed at the high point. December
Oats were *trcrcc in sympathy with wheat
l%c up at 49%G49%c.
and corn. December cloned at 23%@29^ic.
Under the Influence of a 20-cent decline In
the price of hegs. the provision market was
weak from start to finish. The feature of trad-
Ing was continued liquidation- by outside hold
era. At the close January pork was down
SS'ic. lard was off 17%c and ribs were 15c
lower.

The advance in Cheese, while more or less
natural, embraces an artificial and unhealthy
condition. It Is being boomed for all It Is
worth to allow those houses having lines In
cold storage to work them off. This Is now
being don*, at a handsome profit and dealers
make no bones about admitting it. The higher
fresh Cheese can be boosted the more profit
these houses can make out of their storage
goods. This explains the recent rapid advance.

Following closely on the recent tele
graphic report from the East that the
Chicago and Northwestern was con
templating an extension of Its line from
Casper, Wyoming, to Eureka, Califor
nia, comes the news that Harriman has
dispatched a number of his agents to
Casper to thwart a scheme set on foot
by the representatives of the Vander
bilt line to make that town, which is
at present a western terminus of the
latter road, the future capital of Wy
oming. The Northwestern wants the
capital of Wyoming moved from Chey
enne to Casper and it- is reported that
some of the most powerful corpora
tions in that State are working hand
in hand with the railroad company to
accomplish the scheme.
Because the present capital is situ
ated on the main line of the Union
Pacific, which does not connect with
Casper, Harriman naturally Is eager to
have it remain where it Is and to that
end he Is exerting every possible In
fluence to undo the work already ac
complished by the rival corporation.
For several weeks President Marvin
Hughltt of the Northwestern, with
George F. BIdwell, manager of the
Nebraska and Wyoming divisions, As
sistant General Freight and Passenger
Agent Kuhn and other officials of the
same road, have been In Casper -work-
Ing diligently on their plans; which
have assumed a shape discouraging to
the Harriman interests. Harriman has
sent his agents into the field and the
latent reports are that both sides are
preparing for a bitter fight, which
threatens to develop Into one of the
most, sensational political affairs Wy
oming has experienced. Harriman has
called to his assistance the Influence
of corporations that had not already
been 'gathered into the Northwestern
camp and the Union Pacific men are
now claiming . that they are rapidly
getting control of the situation. It Is
well understood that tne Northwestern
proposes to extend its lines many miles
westward from its present terminus at
Casper, but whether it really Intends
to come as far west as Eureka is a
matter for conjecture only.

Judge Troutt Wants More Proof Be
fore Granting Divorce to Maud
A. Collins.
A disappointed and handsome appli
cant for a legal severance of the ties
that bind her to a husband whom she
has not seen for ten years was turned
away by Judge Troutt yesterday. The
plaintiff, Mrs. Maud A. Collins, pre
sented a marriage certificate which had
been torn in two by her irate spouse,
Frederick Collins, as evidence of her
marriage. She then testified that her
husband had deserted her in Denver
ten years ago. A friend who had
known her for seven years testified
that she had heard Mrs. Collins speak
of the desertion. Judge Troutt was not
satisfied with the corroboration and de
cided to continue the case until the
deposition of Mrs. Collins' mother can
be obtained. â¢
Divorces were granted yesterday by
Judge Troutt to Daisy R. Godfrey from
Nathaniel Godfrey, neglect; to Mary
O'Brien from John P. O'Brien, cruelty;
to Clementina Kranz from John Kranz,
desertion; by Judge Kerrigan to Maria
M. Allen from Charles C. Allen, de
sertion; to Mary E. Merritt from Ed
win B. Merritt on a cross complaint,
desertion; to Catherine Everett from
George W. Everett, annulment, because
the defendant had another wife living;
by Judge Graham to Annebelle "Van
Alen from Harry Van Alen, neglect;
by Judge Troutt, sitting for Judge
Sloss, to Herman Frlsch from Bertha
Frisch, cruelty.
Mary I. King desires to make assur
ance doubly sure by asking a Cali
fornia court to grant her a divorce from
Melville S. King. She charges him with
neglect, desertion, cruelty and in
fidelity, the latter accusation being
based upon his alleged misdoings in
Philadelphia, Newark and Paterson,
N. J. She says he earns $125 -a month
and she asks for $75 per month as ali
mony.
Elie Ethler sues Cecelia Ethier for
divorce on the grounds of cruelty, in
temperance and desertion. Peter
Mathias, who owns a saloon on Folsom
street and is said to have $2000 worth
of personal property, is suit for divorce

Assistant District ; Attorney Ashe
asked whether Stevens wanted to be
put on record as associate counsel for
the defendant and Stevens retorted
that he had no objection. The Jury
was out only a few minutes when they
returned with a verdict of not guilty.
Through the intervention of Joseph
Stevens, stenographer In Judge Cork's
court, James Donaghy, alias James
Daniels, was acquitted by a jury yes
terday en a charge of assault with a
deadly vieopon.
It was alleged that Donaghy en
tered the saloon of Charles Leon
ard, 505 Pacific street, on the
night of August 15 and demanded a
drink. Leonard refused and Donaghy
pulled a revolver out of his pocket
and snapped It at Leonard, who ducked
to escape a bullet. Donaghy ran away
but was captured by Policeman Ing
ham. A ' small revolver with three
chambers loaded and four empty was
found in his pocket. Donaghy's de
fense was that he was drunk.
It seemed a clear case against Don
aghy, but while the Judge .was charg
ing the jury Stenographer Stevens out
of curiosity piefked up the revolver and
tried to snap it. but failed. Stevens
drew the Judge's attention to the fact
that the revolver would not snap. The
Judge sent the weapon into the Jury
room.

"Please try to remember that you are

Mogan in dismissing the case.
Mike Egan, of youthful complexion
and heavily ." bewhiskered, was
found asleep at 2:30 p. m. in
Jefferson Square and when ar
raigned . before Judge Mogan he said
that he had just arrived from San Jose
and was seeking' employment when
drowsiness overcame him and the next
thing he realized was his rude awaken
ing iby a policeman. .
"Why are you bearded like a pard?"
inquired the Judge.
"Like a what?", asked the defend
ant. - . .
"Like. a pardâ Shakespeare's 'Seven
Ages,' you know." !
."I- have no bearded pard and I don't
know what you mean by seven edges."
' "I'll give you seven days in jail to
find out what I mean," was the some
what nettled pronouncement.
After riding five hours in John Hud-
Bpelth's hack and thereby incurring an
indebtedness of $5, D. O. Marks, who
claimed to be a business man, gave his
creditor a false address and told him
to call there the next day and get his
money. In the court of Judge Mognn
yesterday he paid' the bill and was re
manded until his self-alleged mercan
tile connections can be substantiated
or proved mythical by police inquiry.
â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢
His Honor Cabaniss perpetrated two
distinct nomenclatural puns within as
many minutes.
"My name is Muddâ J. W. Mudd,"
said the man who accused John Frazer
of grand larceny. "If you prove your
charge the defendant will have reason
to think that he is similarly sur
named." remarked the Judge and then
continued the case two weeks.
When the bailiff shouted "Willard S.
Green, vagrancy," an intensely black
negro shambled up to the bench. "If
you are Green you don't look it," was
what the court said to him and nobody
tittered louder than . the defendant
himself.
Judge Mogan took the case of Conrad
Meyer, a feeble old man charged with
street begging as a text for repetition
of his previously delivered remarks
relative to San Francisco's deplorably
Inadequate facilities for housing its
paupers. The defendant was sent to
the Almshousei but there" was no room
for him in that overcrowded institu
tion and the officer was compelled to
retnrn him to the court.
"All that I can do with this unfortu
nate creature." said the Judge, "is to
sentence him to thirty days /in the
County Jail and request the Sheriff to
see to it "that he is better treated than
an ordinary prisoner. A few days ago
I was obliged to do the same thing
with an aged and destitute woman who
was found asleep on a doorstep on
Fourth street. If the taxpayers cannot
be awakened to the Immediate necessi
ty of Increasing the county's accommo
dations for its paupers the jail must
be .transformed into an almshouse, a
use for which it never was intended.
And I do not like to send to pristtn a
person whose only offense Is poverty-"
Dr. Thomas F. Brennan, accused of
grand larceny in having appropriated
to his own use $37,000 intrusted to his
keeping by the Rev. Father P. J. Grey,
was remanded to the Superior Court
by Judge Conlan, with bail set at $10,
000, which was Immediately furnished.
The defendant's bail was $5000 prior
tc yesterday and after he was pro
nounced guilty by Judge Conlan the
District Attorney suggested that it be
raised to $20,000, but the Judge consid
ered $10,000 enough. In holding the de
fendant his Honor said that no other
course was legally permissible or left
open to him by the testimony, espe
cially for the defense, which included"
no personal denial of the charge or
statement of any kind by Dr. Brennan
himself. *
Although they have been rival res
taurateurs on lower Pacific street for
many months Peter Gltfores and M.
Agerres never exchanged words of any
kind until last Tuesday evening, when
chance brought them face to face In
a saloon and they â¢ were invited to
drink by a mutual friend and compa
triot who was in mellow and hospitable
mood. Without reluctance they accept
ed the proffered wine, nor did they balk
when the gentleman who did the buy
ing insisted that they shake hands and
know each. other better. Less alacrity
marked their asqulescence, however,
when he suggested that each of them
toss a bumper to the other's commer
cial prosperity, but they succeeded in
gracefully gulping down their sinceri
ty with the tipple. Then more wine
was ordered and consumed and still
more until Signor Giffores and Signor
Agerres gradually relinquished discre
tion and spoke what they thought.
They discussed the culinary art and
when Signor Giffores described how
he made a hit by his cooking of raviola
both his formula and method of cook
ing were scoffed at by Signor Averres,
who said he no longer marveled over
the fact that persons in quest of the
dainty mentioned Invariably shunned
the Giffores rotisserie and patronized
the Cafe Agerres. It was this remark
that prompted Signor Giffores to double
up his right fist and smartly apply it
to the left eye of Signor Agerres, thus
inaugurating a combat mat was fierce
ly waging when the policeman sum
moned by the saloon-keeper arrived,
intervened and arrested Signor Giffores
as the prime aggressor. The charge
was battery and it will be more fully
heard next Wednesday by Police Judge
Mogan.
William Perry and George Murphy,
who stole cigars from the Sunset Ware
house, pleaded guilty or petty larceny
and were sentenced to six months' Im
prisonment by Judge Cabanlss.
Thomas Starr, William P. Quirk. An
drew Chlono and James Hennessey,
young fellows, were charged with dis
orderly conduct on a street car last
Sunday evening and before he contin
ued the case till next Wednesday Judge
Mogan announced his intention of se
verely punishing any one convicted in
his court of having willfully annoyed
street car passengers or crews, an of
fense which he pronounced "the most
reprehensible manifestation of hood
lumism.'\
. For neglecting his wife and minor
child Richard Nelson, a sub-contractor,
received severe oral castigatlon from
Judge Mogan ere the case was contin
ued till to-day. The tongue lashing
was inspired by the wire's statement
that the defendant's money and time
were spent on another woman.
Daniel Gleason and Henry Grant
were running away with a bundle of
brooms, which they had purloined from
a grocery, when Patrolman Rug
gles captured them. Their case is set
for hearing to-day.
Nicato Asplca, who slashed Bessie
Stone's throat with a knife early yes
terday morning on the Barbary Coast,
will be tried in Judge Mogan's court
next Tuesday. He quarreled with the
woman in a saloon and when she en
deavored to get away from him Â¦ he
followed her to the street and stabbed
her in the neck, inflicting a deep but
not necessarily fatal wound.
"Which do you preferâ six months'
toll on the county rock pile or betak
ing yourself to sea?" Judge Mogan
asked twenty-year-old John Burns, ac
cused of disturbing the peace by his
widowed mother, Mrs. Emma Burns of
10 Birch avenue. John accepted the
nautical alternative and was allowed
to depart. He has been at sea before,
but disliked the life and ill treated his
mother because she could not afford to
support him in idleness. A policeman
will see to it that he ships for Liver
pool.
Timothy J. Labau was a rather be
dlmmed glass of fashion as he stood
up before Judge Mogan to face Patrol
man Fenner's charge of vagrancy. The
officer said that for several months
past Timothy has had no other appar
ent occupation than to display his glad
raiment in the vicinity of Bush street
and Grant avenue, and Inquiry led to
the discovery that his tailor bills were
paid by a disreputable female. Timothy
pleaded ability to prove good character
and was given till October 19 to collect
his testimony.

Harriet G., stole $40 worth of the ves
sel's provisions as she lay at her wharf
