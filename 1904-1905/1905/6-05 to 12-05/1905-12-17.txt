** OLMES STANTON found 553 Mj street to be a
I \ decent-looking three-story brick and stone house
|| In a respectable though by no means fashionable
A J district. The snow swirled angrily around him
+* Â» as he stood waiting, after having pushed the bell
button, but he was not thinking about the storm which
had. set In a few hours before and was raging with bitter
fury. So bad was the weather, indeed, that for the past
half-tour Violet Dane had been assuring herself that he
would not come. A dozen times, she had gone to the win
dow and looked out. saying to herself:
"I hope it will keep him away. How foolish I was to
ever get myself into this kind of an affair. I'll never an
swer another personal as long as I live."
On the stand in her modestly furnished room lay a
pa.per containing the following advertisement:
"A young man, stranger in the city, would like to
hear from some lady who is also unacquainted and lonely
and who would be willing to take dinner with him on
Christmas, giving in return a few hours of her compan
ionship. Intentions strictly honorable. Address 'Lone
some.' box 751."
There, had been an exchange of notes on the subject,
and with the understanding that she 'was to have the
privilege of declining the dinner if she desired to do so
when the stranger presented himself. Miss Dane had given
Stanton her address.
Her heart gave an unruly bound when the landlady
called from below that there was some one to see Miss
Dane. She stood for a moment, clutching the doorknob
for support, and then, with a thousand wild fancies in her
mind, she went downstairs. . .
As she entered the parlor Stanton drew a long glad
breath of relief. He had feared that he might find her to
lie a fright and had himself been rather busy regretting
that he had followed up his absurd impulse.
Fifteen minutes later, when they were in their car
riage being driven away through the storm, the girl won
dered why she had hot taken advantage of her privilege
of renouncing the agreement, but it was Tather late then
to begin regretting her rashness. The place to which
Stantor. took her, although a fashionable one, had few
guests that day. owing to "the severity of the weather.
Consequently they were able to have a table to them
selves in a cozy" corner where a wood fire blazed com
fortably in a wide, homelike fireplace.
As she sat there removing her gloves and gazing into
the flames Stanton experienced a feeling of satisfaction
such as he had npt dared to hope might come from his
adventure. She was young, she had the air of one who
had been well reared, she was tastefully dressed, and she
was undeniably worth looking at. He had given the
waiter an order, and sat -half leaning upon the table,
studying her profile, when she turned suddenly and their
glances met.
It may have been the warmth from the fire or perhaps
the frost outside had done it. At all events her cheeks
were beautifully reddened and her lashes went down im
mediately.
"I have neglected," he said, "to thank you for your
kindness in not taking advantage- of the clause in our
agreement which gave you the privilege of declining,
when you saw me. to keep the engagement. Let me d% so
now. I am both gratified and flattered."
"* "I couldn't have had the heart," she replied, "to send
you away after you had braved such a storm as this."
He was sorry she said that and he iell to wondering,
utter she had turned again toward the fire, whether she
would have accepted his hospitality if the day had been
pleasant.
The waiter returned with the oysters and. being a
person who appeared to possess intelligence and tact un
common to his class, he discreetly retired to the other
side of the roont after properly performing his office aÂ«
the Utble. .
"In order that you may be fully informed as to who 1
am," said Stanton, "I have brought one of my business
cards." \u25a0
He handed it over to ncr and she read, "Addison,
White, Davis & Stanton, attomeys-at-law," together with
their business address in another city.
"I have but recently been made a member of the firm,"
he explained, "and am here on a secret mission which I
expect will make It necessary for me to remain a month
at least, perhaps two or three. So you see, why I wae
forced to take unusual proceedings to avoid spending
Christmas alone."
She handed the card back to him and he noticed 'that
she was not eating. . ,
"Come, Miss Dane." he said, "I expect you to do jus
tice to the dinner I'm providing. That, I shall Insist, is
part of the contract."
She shook her head and looked at" the crackling log.
"It's too. late," he urged, "to go back on your agree
ment now. I don't ask rou to tell me anything about
yourself if you arc not inclined to do so. You will re
member that my proposition was to furnish the dinner in
return for the privilege of enjoying a few hours of your
companionship. There was no stipulation concerning: an
exchange of confidences."
"I know." she answered, "but I shouldn't have come.
Please don't order anything else for me. and when you
have finished I must insist on being taken home at once."
He put down his -fork and leaned forward, regarding
her anxiously. One of her arms lay on the table. Her
hand was small and white, and he was tempted to lay
his own upon It. but refrained.
"Do you wish," he aiked, "to spoil what I thought a
moment ago was going to be my merriest Christmas?"
"You have already helped to make this my most fool
ish Christmas," she answered." "Please go on eating."
Another couple had entered and taken a table not far
lrom them.
"If you continue to treat me this way." Stanton urged,
"people will think we have quarreled. Come. I shall
not ask you a question about yourself, and If you insist
on being taken h"bme immediately after dinner I will take
youâor send you there In the carriage if you prefer not
to have me go with you. Only eat ' with me. Let us
break bread together. Let us for an hour be friends.
Isn't this the day of universal good will?" ;
She turned and looked frankly into his eyes. A little
smile began at length to play around her lips and she
said:
"Very well, then, the compact is renewed until the cof
fee comes."
Stanton was by this time convinced that she' was one
of the most beautiful girls he had ever seen. Her fea
tures seemed to improve the more he studied them and
when she finally began to laugh at his little witticisms and
to talk freely herself concerning plays that she had seen
and books that she had read he wondered what there
would be for him to look forward to when they had
parted.
The waiter was a jewel. He took off dishes and
brought others on and thyi went away and permitted
them to get through the courses asslowly as they pleased
The fire blazed cheerily, a few more people came in but
still they had their pleasant corner to themselves and
when Miss Dane offered to prepare the salad dressing
fitapton gladly ordered tho things she required. As he sat

watching her mix the various Ingredients she presented
by far the loveliest picture of domesticity that he had
ever seen.
She must have known when she looked at him that \u25a0
his happiness was worth many times what the dinner was
costing him, and it may have been for that reason that
she did not insist on hastening the end of the feast,
though the afternoon was- waning. They had come to
the coffee, when she looked across the table at him and
said? -\u2666', ' \u25a0 ,
"Poor man." '
"It's good of you," he replied, "to feel sorry for me.
I shall be lonelier than ever after this is all over."
"I was thinking of the cigar you wlil have to miss."
"Why must I miss it?- I can smoke here, and you will
wai* f cr mp. won't you?" - â¢â¢"
"There was no provision in the contract to cover that
point, was there?"
"No, I forgot that. It was a stupid oversight. But
you might be lenient and let me have it any way. This is
Christmas. Be charitable." .
When the waiter had cleared the table and Stanton
had stretched his legs toward trie fire after lighting one
of Havana's most fragrant products, the charitable Miss
Dane sat and watched him blow out rings of smoke and
seemed to forget that she was glad her foolish adventure
was about ended. '
Neither had spoken for a long time. The gray line
had crept slowly along from the end of Stanton's cigar
until it had almost reached the -middle, when he came' out
of his reverie to discover that ' she was looking at, him
tather wistfully. She had been thinking of her. own con
ditionâwondering whether she was not wasting her 'time
in the study she had undertaken, wondering whether it
would not .have been better if she had saved her money
and remained at home, perhaps some day' to become the
commonplace wife-of somo commonplace man, in the little
city from which she had so hopefully gone forth, < and
wondering with something like an adhe in. her breast if
success would ever be worth the t loneliness and self-de

GRUDGES - HOW TO TREAT THEM
WHO is there of us who had not at sometime in
his life cherished a grudge? It is a bad thing,
to have in the family, and yet there is an
authentft case of two sisters, living under the
same roof,' attending the same chufch, partici
pating in some degree In the same society, and yet never
speaking directly to one another because of some falllng
out they had In their youth. I know a rural mail 'carrier
whose ,tyork. takes hinv to a certain store three or four
times every day, but for years he and the proprietor
have not been on speaking terms. They '. are forced to
have certain relations to one another, but" they, never ex
change, a friendly word; and yet both are* very "respect- â¢
able men. Down in the Kentucky and Tennessee high
lands grudges have been .carried to' the point of becoming
a 'fine art. Parents have .bequeathed them -to their chil
dren. Many a Highlander has fallen in his saddle as the
sharp crack of a rifle: rang out from the bush behind
which his long-time foe was concealed. .V.
A grudge differs from a momentary impulse of dis- .
like in that the former is nÂ«t /so short-lived and often
it seems to be rooted. in a certain legitimate desire" for
justice. Men feel that so long as a certain crime goes
unpunished, or, a certain ' wrong uhrighted, they ; must
cherish the resentment, and vwalt for the opportune mo
ment to vent their rage. . From this point of; view a
may not be wholly bad when it- represents ,an
Instinct . for the right ordering of the universe in the
visiting of proper 1 deserts upon miscreants. "
Yet "after all a grudge is a perilous and undesirable
piece of \u25a0 property, and . our business^ i 3 to prevent them .
from becoming deo'p-seated in our' hearts. Many a little
misunderstanding which might be cleared away in' an
instant develops into a "grudge because we are too proud
to try and set matters right while 'conditions are still
plastic. ; Your neighbor does something that seems to
you a; slight or injustice. Instead .of brooding over it,
or complaining about, it to, someone- else, why not go

Violet Dane had gruessed It would be. It turned out that
the man had a wife â a wife who was wholly unworthv
of him, but who nevertheless stood between him and taÂ»
one whom nature had Intended for hla mate.
Between the third and fourth acts Stan ton asked the
girl beside him how. In her opinion, the case of the lovers
should end.
-."Jf, the, wife would only die." she Bald, "the solution or
the problenj would be easy. Does she die?"
. "No. she refuses to be accommodating."
"Perhaps she or the man sets a divorce. I shall be
sorry If it has to end that way. though."
"Don't you believe In divorces?*.

leaned far bacK in ncr corner "and waited silently,
her face hidden in the dark. At length the carriage
started forward. One of her hands lay outside of her
muff,* on her lap. Stanton took it in his own, and was
gladdened by a little responsive pressure before she drew
it away.
"Do you insist onÂ«havingr the condition you made put
in force?" he asked when the carriage stopped at 653

we will talk it over." ;.*.'

"gained" your brother, which Jesus Christ said was a
very desirable thing to accomplish when one has a fall
ing-out wfth anybody else. Never neglect the chance to
"gain" him. to get a firmer hold on his goodwill.
And ,in the rare cases where you cannot for fend the
entrance of resentment inta your minds, never let It
fill the whole horizon of-- your thought. Grudges aro
like cankers eating into one's peace, and If you really
must have a grudge about your person, put it away not
only where others will "not see It, but where you yourself
will be only dimly conscious of it. A woman In mature
life said the other day that while she had not learned
many lessons. from experience, she had come to see that
It does not pay to cherish a resentment. It disturbs one's
own happiness too much. It really isn't quite worthy
of a person made 'capable of living- in a region above
petty dislikes and enmities.
And there are ways of ridding one's self, even of a
long-standing grudge, if one will but go about it vigor
ously. "If anyone has offended me." said a wise man
once, "I invite him to dinner." This is the Christian, and
at the same time the sensible temper. It marks a high
state of spiritual culture when one can do good to and
pray -for .them who despitefully use you and persecute
you. ; But such are the heights of magnanimity to which
we fare called. It is not great credit to U3 if we treat
people well, who treat U3 well, but when In return for
unkindness, we give , tokens of lasting goodwill and an
unquenchable purpose not to adopt the tactics- used
against' us/ we are rising above low levels of life and
giving the best there Is in us a chance to express itself.
The 'man who holds onto hi 3 grudge as If it con
tained for him the one great object of existence. whr>
says, "I never can forgive So and So, not to my dying:
day," forgets that- he too Is fallible, forgets the many
just aggrievanc^s which others may cherish against him.
and forgets above everything else, the fact, that ven
geance belongs to God. and not to man. Who are we
that we should venture to usurp functions of the Al
mighty? And in the long run wrongs will be righted in
this universe.

Ship" â is the fourth of a series of thrilling sea
stories by Cutcliffe Hyne, detailing "The Adven
tures of Crptain Kettle." If you want something
that will warm the blood and lift you out of the
dead level of every-day commonplaces, don't miss
these stirring experiences of Captain Kettle. With

' "~y VKX before he left Jeddah. Captain Kettle was quite
-J aware th^t by shipping pilgrims on the iron deck
If of the Saigon for transit across the Red Sea he
*Vâ¢ was transgressing the laws o' several nations, es
pecially those of Great Britain and her dependencies.
But what else could the poor man do? Situated as he was,
with such a tempting; opportunity ready to Ills hand, he
would have been lf-ss than human if he had neglected to
take the bargain which was offered. And though the list
of things that has b'-en s-ild against Captain Owen Kettle
is both black and long. I am not aware that any one had
yet alleged that the little snilor was anything more or
lÂ«ss than human in all his many frailties.
<"ortolv:n came to the charthouse and put this matter
of illegality to him In plain words when the engines chose
to broak down two days out of Jeddah, and the Saigon lolled
lielploss in the blazing Red Seat heat.
Cortolvin up to that time had not made himself re
marked. He had marched on board from the new Jeddah
<;uay where Jhe railv.'i.y is, and posed as "an Arab of the
Sahara who was glorying in the newly acquired green tur
ban >>f a Hadji; ho was nicked on the mate's tally as a
â¢â¢i:iggÂ«-r," along with tome 340 dark-skinned followers of
the prophet, and ho had spent those two days upon an or
thodox square of ragged carpet spread on the rusted iron
plating of the lower fore deck-
When the pilgrims had mustered for victualing, he had
filed in with the rest and hold out a brass lotah for his
ration of water, and a tattered square of canvas for his
dole of steamed rice. You could count his ribs twenty
yards away, but he'd the look of a healthy man. and when
on mornings he helped to throw overboard those of his
fellow pilgrims who had died during the night, it was
j,lain to soe lhat he was a fellow of more than ordinary
muscular strength.
He came to Captain Kettle in the charthouse to re
port that the pilgrims contemplated seizing the Saigon so
soon as ever the engines were once more put in running
crdcr. "They've declared a jehad against you, if you know
what that is." said Cortolvin.
"A holy war. or some such skittles, isn't it?" said
Kettle
"Th.afs about die size of it," said the Hadji; you'll
have to look out if you intend to remain master of the
bleamboat."
â¢I dor.'t require, any teaching of my business from
passengers." said Keltic stiffly.
'/AH right," said Cortolvin. "have it your own way.

"They're an ugly crowd to tackle; 1 grant that."
"They are so, and don't you forget it. I might point
out. captain, that, personally speaking, I'd been a lot safer
If I'd stayed down on the lower fore deck yonder and. held
my tongue. They'd have got you to an absolute certalnty
if they'd ambushed you as was intended, and I could have

"Will you tell me why?" â¢
"Couslnship' of the skin, I suppose. You're white by

that I shall probably get killed during the next few hours
for my pains." ,
"May I ask your name?" said Kettle. "I believe, sir,"
he added with a bow. "that you are a gentleman."
The Hadji laughed. "So far as I recollect, I was that
once, captain. Sorry I haven't a cardon me. but my name's
W. H. Cortolvin, and I lived near, Richmond, in Yorkshire,
before I was idiot enough to go wandering off the Cook's

"Won't you sling that filthy nightgown thing of yours
overboard," he asked, "and have a wash? I can rig you
cut with some pyjamas from the slop chest.". ,',...
But Cortolvin would not change his, dirt and squalor
just then. He had worn it too long to' be affected by it;
"and," said h<?. "I don't want to advertise the fact that I'm
an Englishman just at present. If my dear friends down
yonder on the lower deck knew it. they'd not wait for the
engines to be repaired. They'd fizzle up Just like gun
powder, there and then, and the whole lot of us white men
would be pulled into tassels before we'd timeÂ» to think."
"I don't know about that,", said Kettle. "I've faced
some of the ugliest crowds that have floated on the 1 seas
before this, and they thought they werÂ« going to have it
all their, own way, but they found that when it came to
shooting- that I could keep my end up very handily."
He waved his guest to a deck chair, placed a box of
cheroots hospitably open on the chart table, and then he
went outside the" charthouse and leaned over the bridge
deck rail. The awning above him threw a clean-cut shade
which swung to and fro as the Saigon rolled over the faint
oily swell; and outside its shelter the sun's rays fell like
molten brass, and the metal work was hot enough to raise
a blister. The air was motionless and. stagnant, and greasy
with the smell of humanity. The whole fabric of the
steamer, shimmered in the dancing heat.
For the' dense mass of pilgrims below the situation
approached the' intolerable. I^eft to itself, the rusted Iron
dock beneath their bare skins would have grown hot
onough to char, them. Nothing. but a constant sluicing with
water made it in any way to be endured. And as the
water from alongside camo up to them as warm as ; tea, it
did but little to refrosh. V
The, African can withstand most temperatures which
are thrown- from above on the face of this ; planet, but
oven the African can at times die from heat as glibly as
his betters. Even as Kettle watched, one of the pilgrims,
a griztle-headed Hausa from the western Soudan, was
contorted with' heat apoplexy:, breathed stertorously for a,
minute or so; and then lay still, and immediately became a
prey to flies innumerable, two of his nearest comrades be
stirred themselves to look at him. pronounced that life was
extinct; ;. stood ; . up, and, with an effort, carried the body
out of the press and heaved it over the hot iron bulwark
Into the oily sea t>eneath. It is not good that the dead
should remain with the Quick even for minutes in circum
stances such a3 those.
And while the bearers carried him away, an old white
haired negro from Sokoto stood upon his feet, swaying
to the iroll of the ship, and faced the heat-blurred east
with bowed head. Aloud he bore witness that God was
groat, and that Mahomet was the prophet of God, and
that of mortals each man's fate wa3 writ big upon his
forehead. And then the rest of the pilgrims bent their
foreheads to the torturing deck*^>lates and made profession
of the faith, following his words.
Captain Kettle from his stand against the rail of tha
bridge deck pitied the heathen, and thought with a com
placent sigh of a certain obscure chapel in South Shields:
but at the same time he could not avoid being impressed
by the heathens'' constancy. They might die. but they
forebore to curse God in doing It, and the omission gava
him an insight into the workings of fatalism which made
him think more of what Cortolvln has said.
Every man among the pilgrims had sword, or spear,
or mace, or rifle within grip of his Qst; and as a fighting
foree â with fatalism to back them â he began to realize
that they could make a very ugly company to maneuver
against. A regulation of the pilgrim trade requires that
all weapons ahall be taken from this class of passengers
during the voyage, but Kettle had omitted to disarm them
through sheer contempt for what they could do. If they
chose to fight among themselves, that was their own.

_. _â Â«^ X iuid a pig when we was down on the Little
\ X I Chantay Seeche. The Doctor begjjed him off 3.
\J \y rancher, to e*t up the scraps around the catrs>
Â» V A neat person was the Doctor, and a durned good
oo ok.
We called him the Doctor because he wore specs â that's
ks good a claim as many has to the title. His idee was
that when the pis? got fat he would seil him lor lots of
money, but long before Foxey IJill (which was piggy) had
reached the market stage, money couldn't buy him. He was
a. great pig. My notion of hogs previous to my ac<iunint
;mce with him was that they were dirty, stupid critters,
without any respectable feelings. Perhaps it's because ani
i.ials get man-like when you associate with 'em a' great
deal, or perhaps Foxey Bill was an unusual proposition; but.
anyhow, he was the funniest, smartest brute 1 ever see, a.yd
we thought a slew of him.
Clean was no name for his personal appearance- Every
Sunday the Doctor took a scrub brush and piggy went down
to the creek and combined 'c-.-.i with] the kinU jissl3tknc*>'
Of a cake of .soap. Then Foxcy just shone white as Ivory,
ai.d he'd trot around in front of us. gruntin' to attract our
attention, till everybody said, "Wlfa.t a beautiful, clean pig 1
â ain't lie Just right?" Then he'd grunt his' thaaks to the
company nnd retire behind the shack for a nap. Wo u?cd
to fair kill ourselves laughing at that darned pig. He had
the most wheedlin' squeal, ?o soft and ple.tdin": and he'd
look up at you with them skim-milk eyes or" his so pitiful,
when he wanted a chunk of sugar, that you couldn't refuse
him.
And knowing! Honest, lie knew more'n some men.
One day old Wind River was tollin' s.inie things d'that
might have happened to him) in his usual v.-ay, 'otin' most
careful to get the dat^s and all dead right, ynu know
"now. was his name Pete, after all? Comes to my mind it
was Willyam â Wjliyam Perkins â Wellâ Cut, anyhow, hire:
and me. we saw that Injun," and so forth. This was a Sun
day, and the gang of us sittin' in a circle, fixing leathers
and oae thing and another and misstatin' history faster
than a horse could trot, with Foxey Bill in the middle, cock
ing his head from one speaker to another, t.ikin* it all in.
At last Wind River wound i*p the most startlin" and
unlikely collections of facts he'd favored us with for some
time. Up gets Foxey witfcra shriek and gallops around the
house. Any man with the rudiments of inttrlligcn.-e would
know he v.as hollerin': "Well, that's just too much for me;
ta-ra-ruml"
Wis.d River looked scart. "Say!" says he. "Sdv! Thet
hawg knows I'm er-lyin' jes' *es well's I do." After that
old Windy used to talk to the pig as though they'd beer,
raised together.
Foxcy Bill made one miscalculation. He thought he
â¢was a small pet, like a cat. This didn't jibe with the 503
pounds of meat he toted. And. like a cat. one of his prin
cipal amusements was to have his back scratched. If you
didn't pay attention to him when he squealed so pretty for
you to please curry him with a board, he'd hump up his
Lack like a cat, and rub against your legs. You instantly
landed on your scalp-lock and waved the aforesaid legs in
the air. Of course, when the other fellers saw this comin',
they didn't feel it restin' on their conscience to call yor
attention to it â !n fact we sometimes busied one another
talkin' to give Fox<^- a fair field. So Foxey had thing's his
own way around the diggin's for some time.
Then comes bow-Jegged Hastings, our boss, with a ram
tied hard ami fast In the bottom of the wasoni He ox
plains to us that the ram is valuable, but that he's butted
merry Halifax out of everything down to home, and he
don't want to shut him up. so will we pleans t&ke care of
him? And we said No â Wanitchee heap â we guessed notâ
never.
Then Hastings got mad and talked to us, flyin 1 his
hands. Such a disobligln', stubborn, sour outfit he never
saw. ho said. What was the use of his bein' boss, when
we just laid awake nights thinkin' up disagreeable things
to do to him? Was there ever a time that he'd asKed us
to do this or that, that every man in reach didn't r'ar up
r^nd jump down his throat? He said he'd rather be a nigger
tooster on a condemned Government steamboat than bear
the title of boss of such a rag-chewln\ hide-bound set of
mules; kick, kick, kick â nothin* but kick, and life wasn't
worth jJvin*.
So then he went behind the shack and pouted. Well,
we liked Hastings, and this made us feel bad â that's thÂ«
way he worked us. * -* %
The Doctor he fried up a dish of all sorts in his hap
piest manner and took It around In a cheerful voice. No.
Didn't want food. Heart was broke. So then we all went
and apologized and agreed to keep the ram. Then Hastings
recovered and we had that cussed sheep on our hands and
feet and all over us.
Well, it was like the devil enterin* a happy home As
for Foxey. he just took one long look at the brute, curlin"
and uncurlin' his little tail; then "Hunghr says he." and
Minked his eyes shut, walkin* away from there. I've seen
times when I'd liked to been able to use. the English of
that grunt to thoroughly acquaint some gentleman of how
little I thought of him, but I ain't got the gift of speech.
It was an awful call-down â but the sheep he didn't care.
If there was such a filing as a foolish Sheeny, that's what
a sheep would remind me of.
But the rest of us run into practical applied trouble
in Its various branches. There's one night the Doctor
etarts for the cabin with a mess of flapjacks in his hands,
and the sheep comes up and pushes him in the pistol pocket
so that the Doctor goes sailing into the drink with a stock
of brown checks hcverin* all around him.

The rest of us had lots of faith in Billy, but we couldn't
see where he stood a show to win.
"Shucks!" says Steve. "The sheep'll knock the bacon

wickedness. He don't understand at all. If the sheep
would give him one fair hack, he'd show him! Look! Oh,
Lordy! There he goes again! Damn that sheep!"
It was an awful sight for Billy's friends to witness.
I'll never tell you how many times he went rollin' down the
hill only to come back as game and useless as a rooster
fightin' his reflection in a lookin* glass. He'd chase after
thesheep, gruntin' fierce, but pshaw! the crltter'd simply
trot right away from him, wigglln' that insultin* tail in his
face. Old Bill's tall was colled as tight as a watch-spring
with racre. . "
. "He'll do him." says the Doctor. "He sure will! Now
you wait.

round. "Waitin"an" waitin'. The only play that I see Billy

But we wouldn't let him cut in. Fair play Is fair p!a/.
"Boys." says Wind River, soft, "BUI has laid hu ropes
â I sco it in his eye!"
"G'war, !" sa\-3 Steve. "You see It in your own eye!"
"Well, you* watch," says Windy. . "Bill and ma has been
pretty well acquainted ever since that day he called me a
liar â look at him now!"
Sure enough. Bill was nosin* his barrel away from the
house. I couldn't see the point exactly, but took it on faith.
He was knocked galley-west and crooked three times
before he moved the thing a rod, but whatever he had in
his mind, he calmly went on with it as soon as he got up.
"Oh. thunder!" says the. Doctor. "See, him now! Billy,
you're an old fool! You'll get butted plumb. into the crifc
next pass!" For BUI had pushed the barrel to within five
foot of the edge of the creek. And when he heard the Doc
tor talk, I'll take my oath that pig looked up and smiled.
"He's got him now!" says Wind River. "He's got him
now, for all my next year's salary! I see it in his face!"
And Windy was so dead sure he Impressed the rest of
us. So there's silence while old Foxey Bill is chewin' away
in the barrel, and the ram is comin* over the grass â
t-r-rint, t-r-rint â as hard as he can paste her. head down
and eyes shut. Bill, he don't see anything, either, until
there, ain't more'n three foot of air between 'em, and then
he jumps aside.
"Swoosh !" goes the ram into the water, and Billy
straightens out his little curly tail and waves it in the air
like a flag. And holler! I wisht you could have heard that
pig. Nothin' could have been more human. "I've got the
deady-deady on you, you hook-nosed, slad-slded. second
cousin of a Government mule!" says he. "Oh! I've got you
where I want you and the way I want you, and it's up to
you to convert yourself into cash at the earliest oppor
tunity, for you won't be worth much in the market when
I'm tired of my fun!" This he says as he gallops to the
other side to head the sheep off, hi 3 mild blue eye on fire.
I -tell -you it' 3 dangerous to rouse a fat person with a mild
blue eye.
â¢ ' A "sheep don't swim much better than a mowln* ma
chine', and this feller got desperate â^e was for the shore,
no matter what broke. And Bill ripped the wool out of him
for fair as he tried to scramble up.
"Our fight. Steve!" says the Doctor. "I knew he'd do
him all the. time! You throw up the sponge and we'll yank
the critter out!"
"Let him drown," says Steve. "I don't like him. hide
nor hair â and besides, think what he's cost me."
Butthat wouldn't do. Hastings would have looked so
mournful, happiness couldn't get along in the same terri
tory with him. So out comes Mr. Ram. Done. Everlast

ON Thanksgiving day. 187 â . Private Dennis Hogan.
Company B. Twenty-ninth United States Infantry,
the telegraph operator at Fort Flint. Montana, sat
in his dingy little office In the headquarters building com
muning with himself and cursing the forte of circum
stances that had made him a soldier. The instruments
were quiet, a good Thanksgiving dinner had been en
ioyed and now the smoke from Dennis' old T D pipe curled
in graceful rings around his red head. He was an extra
ordinarily good operator. But some eighteen months be
fore he had arrived at St. Louis "dead broke." and finding
all the telegraph positions taken and promising, appar
t-ntly, to remain so eternally, he had desperately enlisted
in the army. The tbree months of recruit training well
nigh wore him out. but he stuck to it. and two months
later he was detailed as telegraph operator, vice Adams of
G company, discharged.
At 4 o'clock in the afternoon in question he was
aroused from his reverie by the sounder calling "F N"
vigorously. He answered and this is the message he took.
"Department headquarters, St. Paul, Minn., November
L' 6. 1ST â .
"Commanding OSicer Fort Flint. Montana: Sioux ln
uians out. Prepare your command for instant Meld serv
ing thirty days' rations^ UOO 'rounds of ammunition p^r
man. Wire when ready. By command of Major General
Wherry. SMITH. Assistant Adjutant General."
Dennis was messenger boy as well as operator, and
without waiting to make an impression copy, he grabbed
his hat and fleu down the line to the colonel's quari-ers.
At S o'clock that night Colonel Clarke telegrapHed to
his chief that his command was ready, and at midnight he
received orders to proceed the next morning at da.viight.
:>y forced marches, up to the junction of the forks of the
IlVd Bud. take position ih^re and intercept the Indians
should they attempt to cross. Two regiments from the
northern posts were to reach there about the same time,
and the combined strength of the 1 three commands was
supposed to be sufficient to drive back any body of In
dians.
Xow, Hogan wasn't of much note as a garrison soldier
but when an opportunity for a real fight presented Itself
;.!1 the Irish blood in his nature came to the surface, and
sifter much pleading and begging he was allowed to join

ail packed. Two weeks before he had been put repairing

remove them, but something Impelled him to take them
along. â¢
The next morning as the first dim shadows of dawn
stole over the show-clad earth the gallant Twenty-ninth,
Â£00 strong-, swung out on its long tramp.
The weather turned bitter cold and after seven days
of the hardest kind of marching the Twenty-ninth
Â«>urlie<l mid crossed the. Red Bud just below the junction
of the forks. A strong position was token and e\ - ery dis
position made to prevent surprise. The expected rein
forcement would surely come soon and then all would be
safe. But the next day passed with no sign of the rein
forcement. That night queer-looking red blows were' seen
at intervals on the horizon â north, west "and east on the
north side of the. river and to the south on the other side.
Colonel Clarke was old nnd tried In the business of In
tiiiiii v.-isrfare and well did he know what these fires meant
â Indians, and many of them, all around his command.
Ilia hope was that the two regiments still to arrive would
strike them In rear while he attacked them in front.
The next morning first one. then two, three, four, a
humlrrd, ;i thousand figures, mounted on fleet-footed pon
ies, appeared silhouetted against the clear sky, and it was
not ionsj bi-fore the little command found themselves corn
llett-ly he mined in by a much superior force. Slowly they
urew their lines closer and by 11 o'clock a battle had be
gun.
>. "Husband your fire, men. Don't shoot until you have
taken deliberate aim/ and can see the object aimed at,"
was the word passed along the line by. Colonel Clarke.
From behind hastily constructed â¢ shelter trenches the
soldiers fought off the encircling band.' As the firing of
the Indians continued It became more and moro- evident
that every avenue of retreat was snut off. And where
was the reinforcement? Why didn't it come?
Colonel Clarke, early In the evening, of the third- day.
made up his mind to ask for a volunteer to try to get
beyond the Indian lines, make his way to Fort Scott, sixty
rnlles distant, and seek reinforcements there. Six troops
of the Eleventh Cavalry were* stationed there, and if all
went well In three days' time they could be at, hand. The
word was passed along the .line and met with many re
<-pon?os. As the colonel was about to choose First Lieu
tenant Jarvis, Hogan appeared before him, saluting with
military precision, and said:
"Beg^g-In' your pardon, colonel, I think I can-tell ye a
better way. The telegraph line from Scott to Kearney
runs just tv/enty-five miles beyant here to the southwards.
Ip at. the end of our line, on the other, soide of the river,
is. a deep ravine. If I can, get across with a good horse
and slip through the Indian lines on that soide I can, by
hard riding; roach th:s line in two or three hours. I have
a pocket instrument with nxe and can cut in and ask for
THE .SAN; FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALL.
reinforcements from Fort Scott. If, the line is down I can
continue on to the post. Please let me try it, colonel.
Lieutenant Jarvis has a wife and two children, and his
loss would be felt, while IâlI â I haven't any one. sir, and
besides I'm an Irishman, and, you know, colonel, an Irish
man is a fool for luck." This last was said with a broad
grin..
Colonel Clarke knitted his brows for a minute and then
said: "All right, Hosati; I'll let you try it. Take my horse
and start at 3 o'clock in the morning. Do your* best, , my
man. The lives of this command depend on your efforts.
God be with you!" ' *
"If -I! fail, colonel, it will be because I'm dead, sir."
Shortly before 3 o'clock the next morning Dennis
made ready forhis perilous ride. The horse's hoofs were
carefully padded; ammunition and revolver werje looked
after, and he fastened the pocket instrument around his
neck by .the wire so that if any happened to the
horse he would not be unnecessarily delayed. ".
The horse ,\vas a magnificent â¢Kentuckian and seemed
to know what was required of him. Curefully and slowly
Hogan pushed his way to 4 a point opposite the ravine and
then giving his mount a. light touch with his spurs he
took to the water. The stream .was only about fifty yards
wide and in- ri" few minutes he was safely over and climb
in t? up the other bank. Riding up through the ravine he
finally reached, the end of it and stopped on high ground.
Here lie rested, a minute to see if all was well. Appar-'
ently it was; he had got safely beyond the Indian line.
He was. just congratulating- himself on the fact when, di
rectly In front of him. he saw the dim outlines of a mount
ed Indian. Quick as a flash he pulled his revolver and an
other Indian had gone to the happy hunting ground. The
noise of the shot raised a general alarm. Hogan drove the
spurs deep in his horse's flanks and was away with the
s>peed of the wind. But a perfect swarm of Indians fol
lowed, yelling and shooting. On, on he sped, bullets pat
tering all about him. Whenever the opportunity offered
; his own revolver' spoke and more than one saddle was
thereby emptied. Then suddenly he felt a sharp, stinging
paininhis right shoulder and but.for a convulsive grasp
of the pommel.wlth his left hand he would have pitched
headlong to the ground. But no. he told himself, he must
not give up now! The lives of his comrades depended on
Ills succeeding. An hour and' a half more and he would
have sent the message arid then the Indians might do with
him what they could.
There now came a lull in the firing. He drew rein and
listened.-: Not a sound could be heard. Ij had begun to
snow and rays of light on the Eastern horizon heralded
the approach of day. ll* had outbidden his pursuers!
Giving his faithful horse a grateful pat on the neck he
starte- =n. asain 'iding sviftly. He had come within a
â¢ \u25a0
few miles of the line, when, chancing to glance back, he
saw that one Indian still followed him. It was a simple
case of man against man. But unfortunately Dennis had
now fired away all hlÂ« ammunition save one cartridge.
\u25a0Slowly the Indian -grained . on him and he saw the need
of resorting: to his last cartridge press nearer and nearer.
He was now not more than half a qjille from the line: he
could see the poles. If when the moment came, as It
soon must now. the God of battles would guide his bullet
in the. rteht direction, hi 3 message could be sent and his
comrades rescued.- But 'lf the bullet went wrong? His
wounded right arm was numb from pain and his left not
of the steadiest. He pushed* on, resolutely, getting still
nearer ito his goal. Then crack went a rifle and a* bullet
whlzzed f rby his head. "Not this time, ye red dlvil!"
: shouted Â«D3nnis defiantly and there whizzed by a second.
Dennis'dropped off his horse and. wheeling quickly about,
flung himself on his stomach and taking a careful aim
over his wounded -right arm, fired. The shot' apparently
went true; the Indian pitched headlong off his horse.
With an exultant shout Hogan jumped up and started
for the line. Nothing could thwart him now. Loss of
Mood and the intense cold had weakened him so that his
legs were shaky; the e&rth seemed going around, dark
spots were dancing before his eyes; but with a superhu
man effort he stagsrered on and was aoon at the line.
The wire was strung on light lances and if Dennis
had been In full strength he could have pulled one down.
He threw his weight against a lance with all his force,
but to no avail. What was he to do? But sixteen feet
intervened between him and the wire. The horse. -when
Dennis jumped off, had run a little ways and, then stopped,
only too glad to rest. He was now standing near Dennis,
as if waiting to be of further use. Dennis' eyes lighted
on the horae-halr lariat attached to the saddle. Quickly
undoing it he. tied one end with difficulty to the pommel
and the other to the lance. Then he gave the horse a
sharp blow. The horse pulled away and down came the
lance. Making the connections to the pocket Instrument
as best he could with one hand, he placed the wire across
a sharp rock and a few blows with the butt of his re
volver cut it.
Private Dunn, the operator at Fort Scott, opened up
his office bright and early one cold morning and mar
veled to find the wire working clear to Kearney. After
having a talk with the man at Kearney about the Indian
trouble he was sitting around like Mr. Mlcawber. when
he heard the .sounder weakly calling "F S." Quickly ad-
Justing down, he answered, and this is what he took:
"Commanding Officer. Fort Scott. Montana.
"Twenty-ninth Infantry surrounded by large body
hostile Sioux Just north of junction of the forks of the
Red Bud. Colonel Clarke asks for immediate reinforce
ments. Ammunition almost gone. Situation desperate. I
left the command at 3 this morning. DENNIS HO â "
Then blank â the sounder was still and the line re
mained open. \u25a0 The sending had been weak and shaky, as
i: the sender had been out all nicht. Dunn didn't wait to
pick up his hat, but fairly flew to the commanding officer's
quarters. ,The colonel was not up yet, but the sound of
animated voices in the hallway caused him to appear at
the >hend of the stairs in his dressing gown. "What Is It,
Dunn?" 1 he asked!
"A message, sir. from the Twenty-ninth -Infantry say
ing they arc surrounded by the Sioux and want help."
Colonel Foster read the message and then said to
Dunn: "Have the; trumpeter sound 'Boots and saddles.'
Present ray compliments to the adjutant and say I desire
him to report to me at once. Kraus" â this to his Dutch
striker â "saddle my horse and get my field kit ready. Be
quick about it!"
A few men had seen Dunn rushing to the colonel's
r ; uavters and suspected tliat something was up, so they
were not surprised to hear "Boots and saddles" ring out a
lew minutes later on the clear morning air.
The sound of the! firing: across the river, shortly after
Ilogrin left the Twenty-ninth, was plainly heard by *fals
lomnidps, and many a, man exclaimed, "It's all up wit'a
L>c::ny." But the firing frrew more distant, and Colonel
Clark*- began to hope that Hogan had eluded his pursuers
a/rid determined to hold out as long as he could. A hard
itnd trying: tiay followed. The Indians never for a mo
ment relaxed thÂ«?ir vigilance and missed no. opportunity to
deal a blow. Toward 2 o'clock of the afternoon Cdlonel
Clarke, chancinpr to expose himself, got a Winchester bul
let through hJs- thigh. Brave old chap! Never for an in
stant did he giv? up. but after having his wound dressed
as bout it could be done, hr Insisted on remaining near the
line. Lieutenant Jarvis received a shot in the arm. Cap
tain Beiknap of E company was killed and scores of other
l.ravo men were sent to their last reckoning. As the
Elwides of the winter evening crept silently over the earth
the firing: died away and the command settled down to an
r.ther nlsht of the tersest anxiety and watching. When
would it end? Why did those northern regiments -not
tome? Had IJoKan succeeded in his perilous mission?
Such were the anxious c:ucsticÂ»n<s. that the men asked them
selves.
About S o'clock Lieutenant Tracy, the adjutant, was sit
ting b3" his chief, who was apparently asleep. Suddenly
Colonel Clarke sat up and catching Tracy by the arm. said.
'Hark! What's that noise?"
"Nothing, sir, nothing," replied Tracy. "Lie down and
try to rest: you need it. sir." And then aside: "Poor old
chap, his mind wander?." / v !f
'"No, no, Tracy. Listen, man. don't you hear it? It
sounds like the beat of many horses' hoofs. Reinforce
ments arc cominz!" . .
There was heard the snap of tnu.Â«ketd: then a clear
voic?. rung out: I ' â¢â¢flight front into line! Gallop! -March!
Charge!" Those sturdy chaps of the Eleventh Cavalry,
true to their regimental traditions, had arrived, and.
plunging in among: the Indian*. w*-re now scattering them
like so much chaff. The Twenty-ninth, all that was left
of it. was saved.
When a little later Colon**! Foster leaned over his old
friend Colonel Clarke, the latter feebly asked, "Where is
Hogan?" .
"Hojjan? Who is Hosan?" asked Foster. ; ; â¢;
'â¢Why. Hogan was the man who got beyond the Indian
lines and /ode to Inform you of our plight. Didn't you see
him?" ,
"No, I didn't see him." and Foster related how the in
formation reached him.
A rescuing: party was started out. and in the pale
moonlight they came, upon theÂ«body of poor Dennis., lying
under the telegraph line. His left hand still grasped the
Instrument and the key was still open. A bullet hole in
his head told plainly enough how he had met his death.
Beside him lay. the Indian, dead also.' one hand grasping
Hogan's scalp lock, the other clasping a scalplng-knife.
Hogan's shot had mortally wounded him in the left breast,
but. with all the vengeful determination of his race, he
had still crawled forward on his hands and knees, and.
while Hogan was intent on sending his precions message,
had shot him through the head, but not until the warning
had been given. Then his own death overtook him before
he could. execute his last cruel design of taking Hogan's
scalp. Hogan's faithful horse was standing near, as It
keeping watch over his late friend.
They buried Dennis where he lay. and the traveler
passing over that traK will observe a solitary grave
marked by a stone, on which is inscribed:

Private Company B. !Â»th V. S. Infantry
He Died That Others Might Live.THE f.-ut tiiat my book. 'â¢The Cruise of the Mudskow
ski." sold well was almo.n entirely due to Reggy
Stewart.
My cousin Helen says that I am too modest: that
tho book would have sold anyhow; that never since
G<orge Eliot laid down her pen has such an able sea story
been written, but she knows mighty little about books,
and when I faced her down I found she meant Clark Rus
sell instead of Geoi-JT" Kliot. , :
You poo, the publication of the book was delayed ow
ing to a printer's strike, and it did not get into the book
stores until a few days before Christmas, and by that time
ell the books that were going to sell were going like hot
cakes and they shoved "The Mudskowski" off into a corner
where no one could sec- It.
1 know this is so because I went into ten book stores
.md in each case when I asked for it the clerk at first said
they were all out of it and offered me "Tom Cringle's Log'
or "The Cruise of the Cachelot" or "The Pirate" in place of
it. but when I said I had particular reasons for wanting
that one they looked it up and in each case brought me the
only two copies they had thought it worth while to buy,
and then I had to say I only wanted to look at the pic
tures and see whether it was suitable for my nephew.
And in each case the clerk kept his or her temper, al
though it was so near Christmas and they were tired to
death. ;
Of course, it was merely my vanity that prompted me.
I wanted to see my book on sale. But my vanity received
several distinct shocks, for at least three of the salesmen
paid the book didn't look very inviting a.nd I'd better buy
Henty's latest if my nephew was a boy.
And in the last store the salesman was a real salesman,
and the first thing I knew he had sold me. my. own book
at list price, and 1 had not thought of asking for author's
discount until it was too late. â¢\u25a0 .
It was next day that I got a note from Reggy Stewart.
I suppose I ought to say something about him. He is
pretty well known to the public under another name and
for three reasons; he is very eccentric and he Is very rich
and he is a famous artist. He is the man who when he
was married gave the minister a pair of somewhat soiled
gloves and the minister, who was not at all well off and
who had really expected something big in- the way of a
fee. was nearly heart-broken. Of course, he realized that
it was just absent-mindedness on the part of Reggy and
he went to his wife almost weeping. He couldn't write -to
Reggy and s^y:
"Doar Sir â You- have inadvertently sent me a pair of
your old gloves. If you will send me my fee I will kindly
return them."
That wouldn't have done at all. because ministers have
theifown code of ethics and such a proceeding would have
L'oen unethical in the last degree.
But that minister had a wife who was intuitive to the
bottom of her cerebrum. She really ought to have been a
'novelist fnstead of being a minister's wife. Perhaps she
was for all I know. Most everybody is nowadays. Any
way she Â£ai<i, "Goosey, perhaps he 'has tucked a $100 bill
in the finger of one of them.*' '
1 So she turned one of â¢ the gloves -inside-out and there
was nothing in it So she turned the other glove inside
out and then she fainted then and there. * .
Fainted right on a hardwood .floor, although she was
HOW THE "MUDSKOWSKI" WENT
THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALL."
CHARLES BATTELL LOOMIS
i)<> fainter, she knew a $1000 bill when she saw one and
that was what was in the .second glove.
If tin; minister had been l*>ft to himself he would have
chucked the gloves right into the rag bag, and they would
have 'made' some ragman and his wife happy. BuÂ» I'd
rather see a struggling minister happy than a ragman
liappy because I hate those bells.
That's the kind of man Reggy was and when I received
a letter from him postmarked Ard!ey, N. H. (his native
place); 1 felt sure that it would say "Climb to the. top oi
the obelisk, and see what you will lind."
I've known Keggy <_Â»ver since he was poor. When he
was a struggling artist he used to say that if he ever
struck oil (not oils) he-would do fairy stories all the while.
Now many mÂ»-n forget their promises when they be
cc me rich, but Reggy is just as generous and just as whim
sical as he used to be \u25a0\u25a0 when, he was the pet of the Latin
quarter and showered centimes on the Parisian gamins
whenever lie sold a sketch to "Le Rirc."
Here's the letter. (Sorry to have kept you waiting.)
"Dear Buck. (He always calls mo Buck. Don't know
why.)
"If you will go to the store where I left the bill in a
ropy of your miserable book you arc welcome to it if
you find it. J told you not to write that story, as it was
not worthy of you, and I know you will need to be helped
until you have done something worth while. The book
will never sell so you need not hurry about, looking up
that particular copy, but I will say that it was In a store
above Eighth street and below Forty-second.
"Regular- Christmas weather up here and sleighing su
perb. REGGY."
You can imagine how I felt. Me down to <^0 and no
presents bought and there the very day before I had been
to all the leading stores and had bothered them about my
new books. But I knew perfectly well that there would
be at least $100 in the book when I found it. and so I
started out.
No, first I went over to my bookcase and searched
through the miserable book I'd bought the day before.
But it was not there.
I felt it was only too true that the book would not
sell. I had written it to please a publisher and not to
please myself, and such books ought not to sell.
I knew ,it was only a question of searching and if
necessary buying the fifteen or twenty books and that
would take up all my money. Still I'd be at least' $80
to the good.
Tried to find the book without bothering a clerk, but
they'd relegated it to an obscure corner again p.nd at
last I had to ask a young woman for it, and she spent,
five minutes hunting for it, and. when she handed it to
me and I hastily looked it through and saw there was
no money in it she asked me in such a tired way if she
should have it wrapped up that I- just went and bought
it. although I didn't need it.
Of course. I wanted to see the other copy, but she
hadn't brought that, so after the package had come to
me I unwrapped it and made believe there was a.smudge
on it â although I hated to bother, the poor* thing any
more â and she- brought me the other copy, and there on
the very first page was the title and nothing else. And
nothing else in the entire book that interested me.
I walked away without the book I had bought and
was In the next big book department before I realized it,
and then' l wouldn't go badt.
I had begun just after 9 o'clock and 12 found me well
up town with eight books growing heavier and heavier all
the time and nary a dollar in one of them, but me out
over $10. -And not a book had been sold except what I
had' bought. I couldn't forgive Reggy for gauging the
public taste so well, even though I felt grateful to him.
I think it was in the seventh store that I discovered
that a copy r liad been sold to a man and the clerk was
one of those observant fellows who are always drawing
conclusions. He laughed when I . asked him if the book
was selling well. He said. "There was a man* bought a
copy this morning who acted as if he was glad to get it.
Ho opened it in the middle and then he burst out laugh
ing and when it was wrapped up he left the store on the
double miick."
"Do you know who he was?"
"Only that he's a newspaper man: He lives in tho
Farragut Apartments around the corner."
I found his name after inquiring of pretty nearly
every salesman in the store and then in pure gratitude I
bought the other copy, although I had searched it and
found it moneyless and I hurried around to the rooms or
the newspaper man; why I do not know because findings
is keepings and always was.
I was lucky enough to find him in and in a very
Christmassy frame of mind. Ho offered me my choice of
seven kinds and I took a" little of. one and then I left
Christmassy. Not too much so but /just glad that we
were all brothers.
Yes, he had bought the book and was I' the author?
I told him I was and that I had a special reason for
wishing to sec his copy. Then I asked .him why he had
laughed when -he opened it and he. said, "Why, I've been
on the sea a good deal and I happened to open it on a
place where you spoke of the barnacle lamps instead of
the binnacle lamps and I was laughing at the funny mis
print."
I pounded the arm of my chair. "To think that I
should have made my habitual mistake in print. I know
the difference between barnacle and binnacle, but I never
can remember which Is right and I had actually written it
down and it had passed all the, proofreaders.
I looked through the book and after I found there was
nothing in it (thus forestalling tho critics) I told the
newspaper man why I. had been' so anxious' to look at it.
"It's a story," said he. â i
"It's the truth." said I hotly.
"No,- no; I mean it's good for at least half a column
if you don't mird." .
"Go'ahcad." said I. "I believe in art for art's sake and.
all that sort of thing and tho more art the merrier, but
there's nothing in this world like advertising and you
can talk about me In every column, including the editorial
ones if you want to."
Well, he turned out to be a pretty good sort of fellow
and as it was lunch time I threw prudence to the winds
and asked, him to lunch with me.
I knew very well it was safe to let the rest of the
books lie in obscurity until afternoon. And I had but
four stores more to visit anyhow.
We had a cracking good lunch and felt Christmassicr
and Christmassler and then I borrowed $ft> from him (It
was the day after pay day, but he still had it) and I paid
forthc lunch with my own money and set a3lde his to
buy the rest of the booksâ telling him I'd let him In for a
Christmas idinner at Sherry's !M found the money. -. ;
Well that afternoon I took up my march again and
I went to- stores where they had not only never heard
of the book, but had never heard of me.
You'd be astonished to find how many thousand peo
ple have never heard of me. even now that t j "Mudskow
ski" has'made, 'me '.famous.*-,
â¢ But although I spent all the rest of the money I could
not find a bill in. any of the books and so.it being so close
to Christmas I went around to the"hospital that's on the
next block and left the ! books there. Convalescents i are
not very particular about what r . they read and the "Mud
skowskl" sailed in pleasant waters whatever "else may
have been its defects. ;",'-;- *{t
The day before Christmas I bought a copy of the only
paper I ever read In the morning, because it is so amus
ing, nnd there on the first page (but those of you who
take it saw it for yourselves), there on the first page it
said:
"A ehaiipe to win money. A bill secreted in ;i book."
It wont on to say that the publishers of the Cruise
had put a SI OOO bill into a copy of it and that there was
no telling who wcmld get it. but that the book only co3t
$1 50, and it was worth that for Its reading matter and
would make a rattling good Christmas present.
â¢ Well, I toll you I knew what would happen. I knew
what I would do if I read a thing like that. And I'm
just a human being like almost everybody else.
I don't know whether It was that the reporter mis
understood . me or whether he wanted to make -a better
story. I certainly never mentioned the word publisher.
I said Reggy Stewart as plain as could be. but. of course,
if he. had said I had bought all the books up and that
there were not more than twenty In New York no one
would have thought it a good story, and I believo ho
wanted to help me.
I was in Macywakers with Joe Climbers that morn
ing, lie had lent me ?3 with which to buy something
for the one who has since become my wife, and he
walked over to the book counter and while we were there
a stylish-looking young woman came hurriedly up to the
desk and said:
"I'd like to look at a copy of 'The Cruise of the Mud
skowskl.*
"All out. but we have"
The stylish young woman was red-haired and she said:
"I think it's a perfect shame the way you people
neglect to keep popular books. I've tried in two stores
and I can't get it."
And then a floorwalker came up and she began to
storm to him and while she was storming a man came up
and asked for it, and then two boys came together and
then an old lady and then a trampish-looking fellow with
his money all in small change.
The floorwalker went to see the manager of the book
department and the manager of the book department tele
phoned to Didd. Mode & Co. for twenty copies as fast as
they could send them.*
And before the day was over (as I learned afterward)
they sent. in two supplementary orders for 100 each.
And as it was at Macywakers. so It was at Glegel
Sooper's and at all the regular book stores.
It was wonderful how many people bought the book
and then hurried away like a dog with a bone., 1 suppose
they were afraid that some one would snatch the money
if It fluttered out from between the leaves.
Christmas came on Friday and It wa3 the merriest
Christmas I ever had in my life. The merriest and thÂ«
This is why it was the merriest.
My publishers s*>nt me a telegram that ran:
"First edition exhausted. Likewise our clerks. Have
ordered an edition of 5000. Who did it?
- M DIDD. MODE & CO."
And the reason why it was the saddest was because
I was sorry that the book had not been a better one. but
it must have had something In It to commend it or tho
first edition would have been .the last and as those who
lollow book reports know. It went Into the six best seller
class inside of a month, and I was enabled to marry and
settle both down and up before the new year stopped
being new.
No one got the money and the literary periodical? de
plored the taste that would advertise a book in that way.
And then Didd. Mode & Co. published a disclaimer that ad
vertised the book still more.*
But the ciueer part is yet to come.
Christmas afternoon I sought out that newspaper man
â seeing he was a decent sort of chap and a bachelor,
and lonely and I asked him to come around to my room
and I'd give him the sequel of hi 3 story and then we'd
go out together. .;' ~. i':
It was a cold, snowy day. bully for rich people or
those comfortably clad, but a little hard on the poor, and
on the way to my lodgings we passed a Salvation Army
pot that needed to be- kept boiling and I said:
â¢ . "Say. lend me $5 to chuck in here because you've
brought me luck. I'm sure of It."
He said he didn't see the logic of the remark, but he
was game and he chucked In his last five and that left
us without a cent. But I knew a man from whom I hat!
never Uorrowerf and Jt was Christmas and he h^a bowels
because he was poor himself once.
So we went around to my place and the newspaper
chap sat down and picked up the; book I had firat bought.
I had kept it lust for sentiment.,.
And do you know, when he picked it up he turned to
the page where that barnacle for binnacle slip occurred
and there wa^ a $500 bill!
I don't know how I had missed It. but I sat down and
wrote a, letter to Reggy up in New Hampshire with hts
eld folks, and then the newspaper chap and I wont out
to dlne-^â not at Sherry's because we wanted to be com
fortable, but at a little Italian Joint on the West Side and
âwell, that was tho merriest Christmas I ever haC .
And I've forgotten how much change the waiter kept,
but he was happy, too.

Â£ Â£ V T isn't that I object to." protested the Easterner.
1 leaning forward from the rough log wall to give fm-
I phasis to his words, "for I,believe in every one hav
ing his fun his own way. If you're going in for" or
gies, why, have 'em good orgies, and be done with it.
But my kick's on letting these Innocent young girls who
are Just out for the fun â it's awful!"
"It's hell!" assented the Westerner, cheerfully.
"Now, look at that pretty-creature over there â "
The young miner followed his companion's gaze through
the garishly lit crowd. Then, as though in doubt as to
whether he had seen correctly, he tried It again.
"Which do you mean?" he asked, puzzled.
"The one in red. Now. she â "
The Westerner snorted Irrepressibly.
"What's the matter with you?" Inquired the Easterner,
looking on him with suspicious eyes.
The other choked his laugh in the middle and Instantly
assumed an expression of Intense solemnity. It was as
though a candle had blown out in the wind.
"Beg pardon. Nothing." he asserted with brevity of
enunciation. "Go on."
. The girl in red was standing tiptoe on a bench under
one of the big lanterns. She was holding her little palm
slantwise over the chimney, and by blowing against it was
trying to put out the lamp. Her face was very serious and
Hushed. Occasionally the lamp would flare up a little and
she would snatch her hand away with a pretty gesture of
dismay as the uprising flame would threaten to scorch it.
A grcup of Interested men surrounded and applauded her.
Two on the outside stood off the proprietor of the dance
hall. The proprietor was objecting.
"Well, then, just look at that girl. I say," the Easterner'
went on. "She's as pretty and fresh and innocent as a
mountain flower. She's having the time of her young life,
and she just thinks it :noans a good' time and nothing
else. Some day shrfli find out it means a lot else. I tell
you. It's awful!"
The Westerner surveyed h'.s triend'e flushed face with
silent amusement. The rirl finally succeeded in blowing the
light out, and everybody yelled.
"Same old fellow you were in college, aren't you, Bert?"
he said affectionately; "succoring the distressed and bor
rowing other people's troubles. What can you do?"
"Do. do! What can any man do! Take her out of this!
Appeal to her better nature!"
Bert started impulsively forward to where the girl â
with assistance â was preparing to jump from the bench.
The miner caught his sleeve in alarm.
"Hold on, don't make a row! Wait a minute!" he beg
ged; "she isn't worth it! There, now, listen," as the other
sank back expectantly to his former position. His banter
ing manner returned. "You and the windmills," he breath
ed, in relief. "I'll just shatter your ideals a few to pay for
that scare. You shall now hear a fact or so concerning that
l.retty, innocent girl â I forget your other adjective. In' the
lirst place, she isn't in the mountain flower business a little
bit. Her name is Anne Bingham. but she is more popularly
known as Bismarck Anne, chiefly because of all tne camps*
of our beloved territory Bismarck is the only one she hasn't
visited. Therefore, it is , concluded she must have come
I'rorn there."
"Bismarck Anne!"' repeated the Easterner, wondeiingly.
'She isn't the one â "
"The very same. She's about as bad as they make 'cm.
and I don't believe she misses a payday dance a year. She's
all right now; but you 'want to come back a little later.
Anne will be drunk â gloriously drunk* â and very joyful.
I will say that for her. She has all the fun there is In it
while it lasts." '
"Whew!" whistled the Easterner, in dazed repulsion,
looking with Interest on the girl's animated face.
"Oh, what do you care!" responded the miner, careless
ly. "She has her fun."
Bismarck Anne jumped into the nearest man's arms,
was kissed, bestowed a siap, and flitted away down the
room. She deftly stole the accordion from beneath the tall
look-out stool on which a musician sat and ran, evolving
strange noises from the instrument, and scampering in and
out among the benches, pursued by its owner. The men all
laughed heartily, and tried to trip up the pursuer. The
women laughed hollow laughs, to show they were not jeal
cus of the sensation she was creating. Finally she ran into
the proprietor, just turning from lighting the big lamp.
The proprietor, being angry, rescued the accordion rough
ly; whereupon Anne pouted and cast appealing glances at
her friends. The friends responded to a man. The pro
prietor set up the drinks.
The music started up again. Miners darted here and
there toward the gaudily dressed women, and, seizing them
about the waist, held them close to 'their sides, as a claim
of proprietorship before the whole world. Perspiring mas
ters of ceremonies, self constituted and drunk, rushed back
and forth, trying to put a semblance of the quadrilateral
into the various sets. Everybody shuffled feet Impatiently.
The dance began with a swirl of noise and hilarious
confusion. Bismarck Anne added to the hilarity. She was
having a high old time; why shouldn't she? She had had
three glasses of forty-rod, and was blessed by nature with
a lively disposition and an insignificant bump of reverence.
Moreover, she was healthy of body, red of blood, and reck
less of consequences. Pleasure appealed to her; the stir of
action, the delight of tho flow of high spirits, thrilled
through every fiber of her being. She had no beliefs, as
far as she knew. If 6he could have told of them they would
have proved simple In *he extreme â that life comes, to those
who live out their possibilities and not to those who deny
them. And Anne had many possibilities, and was living
them fast. She felt almost physically the beat of pleasure
in the atmosphere about her. and from it she reacted to a
still higher pitch. She had drunk three glasses and her
head was not strong. Her feet moved easily, and she was
very certain of her movements. She had become just hazy
enough In her mental processes to have attained that happy
indifference to what is likely to happen in the Immediate
future, and that equally happy disregard of consequences
which the virtuous never experience. Impressions reduced
themselves to their lowest terms â movement and noise.
The room was full of rapidly revolving figures. The
racket was incessant, and women's laughter rose shrill
above it. like wind above a storm. Anne mo.ved amid it
all as the controller of its destinies, and wherever she went
seemed to her to be the one stable point in the kaleido
scopic changs. Men danced with her, but they .were mean
ingless men. One begged her to dance with him, but Anne
stopped to watch a youth blowing brutlshly from puffed
cheeks, so the man cursed and left her for another girL
Beyond the puffing youth lights were dancing, green and
red. Anne paused and looked at them gravely.'
The people, the room, the sounds seemed to her to
come and go in great bursts. Between these bursts Anne
knew nothing except that she was happy; above all else
she was happy. As incidents men kissed her and she drank;
but these things were not essentially different from the
lights and the bursts of consciousness. Anno began to take '
everything for granted.
After a time Anne paused again to look gravely at I
strange lights. But this time they seemed not to be red
or green, but to be of orange, in long, fiery flaslfes, like rib
bons thrown suddenly out and as suddenly withdrawn. The

noise stopped and was succeeded by a buzzing. For a mo

still, except for a man huddled in one corner and â¢on. the
floor a slowly gathering pool of red. Some one thrust her
out of the door with others, aÂ§d she began to step aimless
ly, uncertainly, along the broad street.
She felt dimly the difference between the hot air of
the dance hall and the "warm air out of doors. The great"
hills and the stars and the silhouetted houses came and
went in visions, just as had tHte people and the noise inside
the hall. _ The Idea of walking came to her and occupied her
mind, to the exclusion of everything else, and she set about
It with great lntentness. â¢
How far she went, and in what direction did not seem
to matter. When she" moved she was happy; when she
stopped she was miserable. She wandered on in the way
she knew, an^d yet did not know, out of the broad streets
of the town, through a wide cleft In the hills, up a long,
grassy valley that wound slowly and mounted, gradually,
following the brawl of the stream, until at last she found
herself in a little fern-grown dell at the entrance of Iron
Creek Pass. She pushed her fingers through her fallen hair
and idly over the shimmering stuff of her gown. Far above
her she saw waverlngly the stars. â¢ Finally the idea of sleep
came to her just as the Idea of walking had come to her
before. She sank to her knees, hesitated a moment, and
then, with the sigh of a tired child, she pillowed her head
on her, soft round arm and closed her eyes.
The poor-wills ceased their plaintive cries. A few
smaller birds chirped drowsily. Back of the eastern: hills
the stars became a little dimmer, and the soft night breeze,
which I had been steadily blowing through the darkened
hours, sank quietly to sleep. The subtle magic of nature
began to sketch in the picture of day, throwing objects for
ward from, the dull background, taking them- bodily out
of the blackness, as though creating them anew. Fresh life
stirred through everything. The vault of heaven seemed
full of it, and all the 'ravines and byways caught up its
overflow in a grand chorus of praise to the new- whitening
morning. . .\vs , j
The woman stirred drowsily and arose, throwing back
her heavy hair from her face. The flush of sleep still dyed
her cheek a rich crimson, which came and went slowly in
the light of the young sun, vying in depth now with the silk

red-bird which splattered into rainbow tints' the waters
â¢ â¢. Themorning swept through her like a river and left
her clean. In the eye of nature and before the presence
of nature's innumerable creatures she stood as Innocent as
th?y. She had entered. Into "noisome places, but so had the
r> â -sh-hawk poising grandly, on motionless wing there
â¢â¢^ove. She. had scrambled in the mire, and she was ruffled
and draggled and besmirched; so likewise had been the si
lent flame-bird in the thicket, but he had washed clean his
plumes and was now singing the universal hymn from the
nearest bush-top.
"She stretched slowly, lazily, her muscles^ one by one,
and stood taller and freer for the act. The debauch of the
last, n'.srht, the debauches of other and worse\nights, the
Rcirt-uire corrosion of that vulgarity which is more subtle
than sin even, all these things faded Into a past that was
cienil twirt gone and burled forever. -The "present alone was
important, and the present brought her. Innocent, before
an Innocent nature. As she stood there dewey-eyed, wist-

np.viy come to earth. To her 'the morning was great and
broad, llke,'a dream to be dreamed 1 and awakened from,
something ' unreal ' and evanescent which would go. Her
heart unfolded; to its influence, and she felt within her that
tenderness for the beautiful which is nearest akin to holy
teaFS. .
As she stood thus, musing, it seemed natural that a
human 1 figure should enter, and become part of the dream.
It seemed.. natural, that. it should be a man, and young: that
he should be handsome and bold. It seemed natural that
he should rein in his horse "at the sight of her. So inevi
table was it all, so much in keeping with the soft sky, the
brooding shadow of the mountain, the saulrrel noises and
the day that sho stood there motionless, making no sign,
looking up v him with parted lips, saying nothing. He
was only a fraction, a small fraction, of all the rest. His
fine brown eyes, the curl of his long hair, the bronze of his
features mattered no more to her than the play of the sun
lijrht on Harney.
Then ho spurred his horse forward, and something in
her seemed to snap. From the dream-present the woman
was thrust' roughly back into her past. The sunlight faded
away before her eyes, oozing from the air In drop after
drop of golden splendor, the songs of the birds died, the
murmuring of the brook became an angry brawl that ac
cused the world of wickedness. The morning fled. Â«
From a distance, far' away, farther than Harney, far
ther than the sky, the stranger's brown- eyes looked pity
ingly. Her sin was no longer animal.' It had touched her
soui. Instead of an Incident it had become a condition
which hemmed her in,' from which she could not escape.
Suddenly she saw the difference.' She dwelt in darkness;
he, with his clear soul, dwelt In light. She threw herself
face downward on the earth, weeping and clutching the
grass in the agony of her sin. . \u25a0\u25a0â¢
Then a new sound smote the air. She sat upright and
listened.
Around the bend she heard a high-pitched voice de
claiming In measured tones.
" "Thy kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and thy
dominion endureth throughout all generations," the voice
chanted.'.
"'The Lord upholdeth all that fall, and ralseth all that
be bowed down.' " ...
The speaker strode in sight. He was one of the old
fashioned itinerant preachers occasionally seen in the Hills,
filled with fanatic enthusiasm, journeying from place to
place on foot, exhorting by the fear of hell fire rather than
by the hope of heaven's bliss, half-crazy, half-inspired,
wholly in earnest. . His form was gaunt. He was clad in
a shiny black coat, buttoned closely, and his shoes showed
dusty and/huge beneath his, carefully turned-up trousers.
A- beaver, of -ancient pattern was pushed far back from his
narrow, forehead, and from beneath it flashed vividly his
fierce hawk-eyes. Over: his shoulder, suspended from a
cane, was a carpet bag. -He stepped eagerly forward with
animmense excess of nervous force, that carried him rap
idly on. Nothing more out of place could be Imagined than
this comical figure against the simplicity of the hills. Yet
for that very reason he was the more grateful to the^wom
ah's perturbed soul. She listened eagerly for his next
words. â /\u25a0; - a â¢- \u25a0 V ;. ' \u25a0 â¢ , . â¢\u25a0_ ' '

Anne saw but two things plainly in all the world â the
clear-eyed stranger like a god; this fiery old man who
spoke words containing strange, though vague. Intimations
of comfort. From the agony of her soul but one thought
leaped forth â to make the comfort real, to find out how to
raise herself from her sin, to become worthy of the good
ness which she had that morning for the first time clearly
seen. She sprang forward and seized the preacher's arm.

one of Irksomeness: the third one of wearisome monotony.
The first was as long as it takes to pass from one shore to
the other of the great dream-sea: the second was an age;
the third an eternity. The first was rose-hued; the second
was dull: the third was filled with the graynesa that blurs

She was quite unprepared for any such observance on
the part of her small adherents, for her first study of

The knowledge saddened all his hours, and was the
more maddening because it could in no wise be shared by

all sorts of artful beguilements to make him happy and at

is covered with them, and their wrappings of purple tis

too. beoomos urgently perceptible. It is of all sizes, shapes

Teacher's eyes fill with tears of 'gratitude as each new
piece or box is pressed against her nose, and teachers
mind is fu!! cf wonder as to wty t she can ever do wltn
all of it. Bottles of perfume vie with one another and
with the all-pervading soap until the air is heavy and
breathing grows laborious, while pride swells the hearts
of the assembled multitude. No other teacher has so many
helps to the to'let. None other is so beloved.
Teacher's aspect is quite changed, and the "blue long

she had received. Jacob's comb has two massive and be

"But. Morris, dear," cried teacher unsteadily, laughing?
a little, and yet not far from tears, "this Is ever so much
.nicer than soap â a thousand times better than perfume;
and you're quite right, it- is for ladles, and I never had one
in all my life before. I am so very thankfuL"
*,-. "You're welcome,, all right. That's how my papa says;
it's polite," says Morris proudly. And proudly he takes
his place among the very little boys, and loudly he joins
in the ensuing song. For the rest of that exciting day he
is a. shining point of virtue In a slightly confused class.
And at 3 o'clock he -Is at teacher's desk again, carrying
on the conversation as If there had been no Interruption.

Part 111HOW THE JEWS REGARD CHRISTMAS
RABBI JACOB NIETO
> V \u25a0 \u25a0 â¢ .'
tt *â¢ OW the. Jews reerurd Christmas is a- rtutter Ghat can
1 \u0084..\ in no sense be sene^lly treated/for the attitude of
JL J . the Jewish people i*Â»vard this festival :depÂ«nds <tn*\
*^ tirely upon how the Christian's In their city or vicin
ity put Into practice the teachings of Christ To
treat of the subject, however*. In.'a lucid and â¢"intelligible â¢
manner It will be necessary to become somewhat historical
and to trace from its first ti^fl: -effect o* the at
titude of, its celebrants toward, the- Jewish .people.
The fable of the wolf and. the lamb woul* seem to have
been almost composed to describe >the feeling and disposi
tion of Christian communities toward Jews found. ln their
midst; at Yuletlde not only in the early and middle ages,
but even unfortunately In civilized countries to-day. The
story of fheV Irishman, who. after attending service on ;
Easter mornirig", turned ojtfm his Jewish -friend and com- -
panion and belabored hliijti'. because he had for the_ first time
heard that the Jews killed Christ.may still be the cause,
of some merriment to those vho heaVit, and yet it is nearly
enough true to be taken *erlously. 'A parallel story Is
found in the narrative/of the martyrdom of the ten Sages.
It ;tsl related that one % of the Roman Emperors who was
contributory to the destruction ; <jf Jerusalem had ten of
the most eruditÂ© scholars summoned before him" to inquire
into their law, and when they . were assembled" he' aske<l:
them to tell him- frankly arid truthfully, the verdict In a
case where a man had b ( eien caught stealing, one of his
brethren, and he enslave him or sell him; and they, honest
, ijien, replied, "The thief shall die," "In that case,"' ;i h'Â«|re.-.
joined, "it Is recorded here of your ancestors .thatjithey
sold one of their brethren to the Ishmaelites for_itwÂ«rity
pieces of silver. If they had been living I would^.have -
brought them to trial in your presence, but now you must
bear the Iniquity of your fathers," and they were executed.
This is the kind of justice that has been meted out to the \
Jew from tha .very rise of Christianity. " In the early and \u25a0
middle ages, when at Easter and Christmas the; popular '.
mind was Incensed and. the people's passions were Infuri
ated by '. the exaggerated, accounts of the crucifixion,^.. no;
Jew felt it safe to* be outside his house jon those festive /;
occasions, nor tor that matter felt, secure in his 'home, s
though "he had barricaded It. In fact. Christmas day was. a '
day of mournlngjand fasting, and the New Testament be
ing at that time. a proscribed book to the Jew, it Is not to :
be marveled alAhat they should execrate the name and
memory of him whose teachings, judging by the atrocities
perpetrated upon them In the name of Christ and Christian
ity, had prompted" the unnamable and inhuman outrages
that decimated their ranks each year.
This, state of affairs is lamentably not unknown to-day-;
WHAT CHRISTMAS MEANS TO THE CHRISTIAN WORLD
IT IS a great satisfaction that we can say, this of Christ
mas. And. as the nations which celebrate Christmas
are, in the province of God, the ruling nations of the
world, whether by force of arms or tiy the success of
commerce, or by a certain "thirst . for the horizon,"
which characterizes some of those races, -I suppose that
millions of people will engage In Christmas^ festivities who
never heard of the Savior of men,, or having heard of him,
know nothing about him or his birth. \u25a0{:\u25a0]':\u25a0 -\u25a0,;
It was a very pathetic thing, a few years ago, when to
those armies who were enrolled in the-. Boer, country
Christmas day came. Without any flag of truce, witn*out
any professed agreement, all hostility was suspended \u25a0 on
Christmas day. Picket did not exchange shots with picket,
and for that day men did not study war. There was a story,
perhaps apocryphal, of a mortar which sent a plum pudding
across a valley two or three miles , wide. Let us hope that
the story Is not apocryphal; or if It were. a 'myth,, let some
of the many poets who will read these lines accept it so far
as to write a Christmas ode describing the flight of that
plum pudding, for us to print when another year , comes
round. \u2666 â¢
The Christmas of the Northern nations is a- winter
Christmas and always has been. Till Captain Cook's day,
and later, the Northern nations have had the principal word
In literature, In history, and especially In song. .If the"
Queen of Sheba had court poets, and I suppose she had, the
papyrus. on which they wrote down their, poems has long
since rotted, and perhaps they had some superstition, which
prevented them from carving their odes on any monoliths
of their day. But now. when we have the Cape Town Ad
vertiser and - the Melbourne Bugle and. the Tasmania'
Chatterer arid the Dunedln Delight arid the Eagle fluttering
its wings In the New Hebrides, nay, .very, soon the Figaro
"which will be published In Wilkes'Land, or somel other
section of the Antarctic continent, now in these later days
-of Southern civilization, Christmas will have to adapt Itself
to new songs and .new festivities. - / , /

\u25a0}' The dawn. of our. later civilization in proportion as it
enlightened Christendom lightened the miseries of the Jew
and even though the- sentiment of Christmas. "On earth
Peace and good will toward all men." was rather expressed
than practiced, still tfiÂ« continual repetition of the senti
ment served In admeasure to assuage the harsh and un
warranted feeling "against a people whose side of the cru
cifixion story has riot yet been heard. â¢ ;
...In Germany, where a cold aid' refined, but nevertheless
strong and determined anti-Semitism prevails. I do not
think the advent of Christmas Is. very jubilantly hailed by
the great mass of Jews In that country. 'though., indeed, the
few who strive after social preferment will assume any ex
terior that social amenities 'may demand. \u25a0>-.
In England, where the Christmas season merely Inau
gurates a period of unbridled' profligacy and drunkenness
for the multitudes of Its population, the Jew. always \u25a0 a
temperate man. does not view the"f estlral with any degree
of favor. He is indifferent. The later arrivals from Rus
sia and Poland evince the greatest dread of the return of
Christmas. ; . \u25a0 * :
But here in this country, where anti-Semitism is confined
to the narrow minority that God and nature never intended
for big thoughts or big deeds, to a coterie of egotists who
doubt the sanity and Integrity of all but themselves, the
Christmastlde has assumed for the Jew a new significance.
Here no church fulminates anathemas" that engender vi
cious thoughts in the minds of Its communicants; no pastor
or priest play 3 the role of wolf Intent upon destroying the
descendants of the Jewish people because a cowardly Ro
man Governor shifted the blame and the burden of hf3 of
ficial act on to their shoulders. Here, where the absolutely
, sectarian character of, the celebration Is lost in its larger
and -more truly religious and humanitarian aspect, the Jew
feels that he, may participate with his Christian fellow
cltlzen In proclaiming "On earth peace and good will
ward all men" because he. more than any other man. has
made sacrifice for this same Ideal. He feels as 'did - his;
fathers at the feast of Esther, when they sent presents to**
their friends and gifts to the poor, .that there Is afforded"
him another opportunity to exemplify the teachings of til 3
own religion, and takes advantage of the occasion to dem
onstrate"to his neighbors that he can enter Into the spirit
of his Joys and if need be promote his happiness. \u25a0â¢
The Jew wishes that "there were more than 'one occa

The word ttm God. And 'the word wsj made fleÂ«h, and dwelt

IN THIS summary way does the evangelist who, of the
four, has told us most about the person of. Christ,
express the "wonderful economy of. redemption, by
which God became man. the highest became the low
est, the Creator took his place among his creatures,
power became weakness, and wisdom looked to men like
folly" Upon this glorious, unfathomable truth of the in
carnation our hopes of the future depend. Upon it also
depend the principles of our religious life here upon earth,
which must of necessity be the preparation for that future.
And so. while it seems almost like an officious intrusion
upon the sweet spirit of the festival to indulge in pro
cesses of reasoning when we should rather ."rejoice and be
qUA" stilL we may reverently inquire so far into the
Christmas mystery as to see what it has done to foster
our Christian life by making its supreme duty easier.
As God is a spirit, to worship him is to worship a
\u25a0plrlt. Since, however, we have never had any experience
of spiritual beings, and cannot, for that reason, even Im
agine what they are like, this worship of God, which Is
our highest religious duty, is necessarily extremely diffi
cult. Worship is a mental and intellectual act: the will
and mind must produce it. or it does not exist. But as we
cannot think at all without tho accompaniment of images.
however faint, in the Imagination, the thought of God,
involved in the worship of him. must be attended by some
image of him. * The difficulty of forming this image it is
which commonly makes our mental grasp or God so feeble.
He is too often little more to us than an abstractionâ a
name to which no reality corresponds. You will at once
realize what this means if you have ever tried to cultivate
devotion to God the Father or to God the Holy Ghost. To
most people the object of such devotion will probably
seem illusive, vanishing before them as they try to lix
their mental eyes upon it.
This initial difficulty of worship, arising from the spir
ituality of God. is increased by a second, which springs
from the character of the worship ho requires of us.
Worship is an intellectual act; true, but it is more than
that. It is an act of the whole being. The first and great
est commandment is this: "Thou shalt love the Lord thy
God with thy whole heart, and with thy whole soul, and
\u25a0tvith thy whole mind." ; Not only our intellect, but 9111
feelings, our emotions and our affections, are to hav<* :i
share in our worship. Without these the purely mentai
acts which form the basis of our love and adoration arc
cold auJ feeble. It is the heart which gives to worshir
its power and warmth.
When our emotions run along v/ith our reason and wil
religious arts are easy. When they are absent or con
trary it takes all our resolution i.nd self-control to rernaii
faithful to our duty. One-half our being seems then U
be warring against tho other half; and in the end. if th<
conflict be long and fierce, our mental faculties too oftei
lose their mastery, and we are swept along by our rebel
lious feelings.
And yet these feelings arc a part' of our strange littU
being. Indeed they are the effective forces of life, power
ful for good when they are brought to the support of
virtue; demon furies when perverted, to the service of sin.
They are Gods gifts to us. and he asks us to direct them
to his worship, so that our whole being, spiritual anil
physical, may offer him one harmonious homage.
But how can we bring our hearts to serve him? Car
the thought of the invisible Spirit God. who is everywhere
and yet nowhere, warm us with the glow of fervor? Can
an immaterial being' kindle emotions within us? Can the
arms of our affection enfold that which we cannot even
imagine? . S
God demands the love of our heart. But the heart
needs the tangible, the visible, the present, the concrete,
to move it deeply. It was the lack of these that made the
worship of God doubly hard to the chosen people of old.
They wanted to see and feel their God. and in consequence
repeatedly fell a prey to the idolatry of their heathen
neighbors. When Moses delayed to come down the moun
tain his people forgot the Lord whose prophet he was, and
cried out to Aaron. "Arise, make us gods that may go
before us." (Exodus xxxii:l). It was but the strong
cry of their emotions drowning the sounder but weaker
voice of reason.
And so it was throughout their history. Â«* They were
constantly falling away; and It was only by the direst
punishments that God could hold them even to a fitful,
cold and feeble worship.
But, surely, a merciful father will at length have pity
upon this weakness of human nature. He will not always
remain far away from his children. He will not forevei
deny the cravings of their heart. He will come to them
He will no longer rule them by( fear. lTe will win then:
to himself by love and hold them by the cords of Adam.
What is It here on earth that draws us most power
fully? What can stir our soul to its depths? What car
make us better than we are wont to be? What can In
spire us at times to forget ourselves and rise to gen^erou:
sacrifice? What Is it that can bind us by the purest, th<
tenderest, yet the strongest bonds? What but the strength
of a human life, the love of a human heart like our own'
Our nature responds to its like. The touch of a hand maj
thrill our being; a word may fix our wavering resolution
a glance may arouse our faltering courage; or the sounc
of a voice may soften us to tears. .
THE PHILOSOPHY OF CLOTHES
THE troubles of the human race began with clothes
and most of them since the bediming have been
connected in one way or another with the grave
question of how shall a man be clothed. This re
mark is particularly applicable just now Jo thoso
of us' who arc still garbed in our summer underclothes .
and are wearing our fall overcoat with the assumed non
chalance of a man who really doesn't mind the cold and
only puts on an overcoat at all to please his wife.
The second stop In the development of the garment '
making industry was in the adoption of the discarded
wearing apparel of various and sundry beasts of the
field. It is to be feared that Eaid beasts were seldom .
consulted as to the time and manner of the process of
discarding. baO then very few men even to-day have
anything to say about the kind of clothes they shall
wear and when they shall wear them. . ..
After the fur stage came the iron age when every
man with designs on his neighbor's hencoop or cash
drawer decked himself in the contents of a hardware
store with a saucepan on his head and, a toasting fork
in his strong right' hand. In : those days a battle sounded
tike a strength test between a couple of steam riveters
and the military academies were equipped with anvils
and sledge hammers to give the cadets experience In the
Eontle art of fencing us it was practiced, in those days.
We refrain from pursuing the devious route by which
the development of the fine art of clothing ourselves has
reached the present high point /where a man can spend
half his salary for a tuxedo and then look like an under

Jesus lives to-day on every Catholic altar, for on the
r.ight on which he was betrayed he took bread, and
blessed and made it his body; he took wine and gave
thanks and made it his blood; and he gave his priests
the power to do what he had done. Frail, ignorant, sinful
man. by the sacerdotal power given to. him, compels the
presence of the highest; he lays him up In a small taber
nacle; he dispenses him to a sinful people â the same
gracious Savior who had compassion on the multitudes In
the wilderness; who brought Mary Magdalen weeping to
his feet; whose touch healed the sick; who comforted the
grief-stricken widow of Nairn; . who wept at the tomb of
Lazarus; and whose look of reproach brought the tears
of repentance to the Â«yes of Peter.
The doors of his temples are always open, Inviting us
to enter and adore. There In his divine presence our
hearts grow warm again, our strength is renewed and our
courage revived.. There our greatest difficulties of worship
to the . present \ day we shall turn our. attention to the
case of ;J. Seedy Wilkinson and endeavor- to show how
some of the bearings of our previous remarks; lie in the
application on 'em. J. Seedy- was early taught that good
old doctrine that a man is a man for a" that. '. This being.
Interpreted 5s generally, taken to mean that any : \ man
has a right to think as much; of himself as of anyone
else, if not' more, and that.; no matter, what an ( impartial
Invoice might disclose , a man's' own price list is. the
determining ' factor. . ' Acting in accordance ' with his early
instruction J. Seedy determined that, altogether too -much
attention was given to clothing the outer -man and too
little to the embellishment .. of the inner.
Therefore, or for some other reason, J. Seedy gave
his attention to. the cultivation of his intellect and -wore
clothes only because : there appeared to be a general pre
judice that way. r His trousers . bagged at the knees, and
were fringed', al the bottom: his sleeves .came; to an
abrupt termination two inches short : of their proper-des
tination, and his "shoes were as badly;; run J over-; as", a
pedestrian wno>assumes: that/public highways;: are made

Hair he, held to : be an- Indication of ;;genius and 'so 'he
permitted- his to; run; riot till it was in imminent.. danger
of Inducing arhurry-up call, for : the police reserves. ';
Having made all his arrangements? for being the .real
thing ; in. the way of ' a;blithering. genius,; J.: Seedy set out
to inform the .world that a. real man; had .arrived, and
was prepared' to "open negotiations for; the acquisition of
fame'and fortune. \u0084Now., Now. be It known i that- J.*- Seed y.^was

an ; empty tomb,* nor -'strain- 'our eyes to see him in the
distant heavens. \ .-..We" know "".where they have laid him
under visible symbols, and we may arise and go to him
there, and satisfy the irrepressible cravings of our hearts
to have him near us.
Even those who think they cannot believe he lives
thus locally present In our' midst feel, when they are
alone in a Catholic church, that there is some; influence
there which they find nowhere else. Is it- strange that he.
whose presence, unrecognized, made the hearts of the two
disciples burn within them as they journeyed with him
to Emmaus should still make that presence felt by, those
who come nearest to him? He is not dead but liveth. and
wherever he is virtue;still goes out from him.
Yes. . for our poor sakes :the word made flesh still
dwells among us. "There in the tabernacle is. the lowli
ness of his birth; the obedience, of his childhood: the
obscurity of his youth; the patience of his ministry; the
sacrifice of "his crucifixion, and the triumph of his resur
rection; so that the real presence is but the compliment
of the mystery of, -. Christmas. The life; which began in
the cril* continues on the altar.
With this llfoVonstantly before them, isi it any wonder
that so many of his children will follow him anywhere?

follow me." Their generous hearts have answered the
invitationr and they have arisen and left country and'name
and father's house to serve Ms orphans, his sick, his
aged, his blind, and his lepers.
Take away the altar presence and you take away thÂ©
inspiration which has led so many men and women to
follow the Christian counsels of perfection. The hundreds
and thousands, and tens of thousands, who have forsaken
all the world can offer and are living for God and God'a
interests alone, derive their strength and personal devo
tion from the divine life in the tabernacle.
Alas! -that to most of us. that life still means so little.
"There hath stood one In the midst of you whom you
know not" â one who came that we might have life, and
might have it more abundantly. Men live the sensual
life: they live the intellectual life: they live the social and
the worldly life: they do not "live the divine life. They do
not want lt^ "You will not come to me that you may have
life." Nor do they care more for the other blessings that
he â¢ proffers.- They grope about and will not -follow the
way: they are full of questionings and will not Interro
gate the truth: they are in darkness and will not see the
light: they are In sin and will not have the Redeemer.
O thou who art the way. the truth and the life: thou
who art the light of the world and the Redeemer of the
nations, bear with us in our perversity, convert our hearts,
enlighten oyr minds and direct our feet into the way
of peace! ;

to be told that there was -nothing doing and that he was
mighty lucky' that they didn't set the dog on him. Finally
a : kind-hearted* gentleman who thought that he could
detect signs of ability under our friend's uncouth exterior
took it upon himself to show him where the . trouble re

A word to J. Seedy was sufficient, especially since it
was 'work or starve. His surplus funds were Invested In
a suit of. clothes : which .fitted him. 'at 'least in the more
salienf places, and he made a contract \u25a0 with a friendly,

a * â¢*â n ESS," remarked Dorothy ten
â¢ â¢ tatlvely, "suppose mamma
Jr^ were to forbid me loving on*
f*? ) -whom I lovedâ" Here she
broke down, aghast.
"My dear Dorothy." ccjed the other,
surprised into deepest concern, "your
mother didn't Bee him kissing your.lin
gers, did she?"
"Oh, no, Bess," said Dorothy hurriedly,
"we were cuite alone."
"You foolish girl," returned Bess. "You
alarmed me!"
"But really. Bess," persisted Dorothy,
"to put It this way: If your mamma In
sisted, would you give way and marry a
man you didn't love?"
"You mean Count Storri," replied Bess.
"Now, Dorothy, listen to me. In the first
place, you are an arrant hypocrite. You
pretend to be soft and powerless and
yielding, and to appeal to me for counsel.
And all the time you Â«re twice as . ob
stinate as I an, and much less likely to
accept a man you don't love, or give up
one whom you love."
"Well, Bess." said Dorothy defensively,
a bit stricken of these truths, "really, I
want your opinions on marriage."
"Oh, that Is it: Then snap your fingers
in the teeth of command, and marry no
man whom you <3o not love!"
"But the man you love might not want
you:" sighed Dorothy.
"The man you love will always want
you," declared Bess with firmness.
"How sweet you are!"
"And as for parents making matches
for their daughters," continued Bess, un
moved of the tribute, and speaking as
one who for long had made a study of
the world's domestic affairs, "It is sure
to lead to trouble and divorce."
"Is it" asked Dorothy, appalled.
*"It Is!" returned Bess with a sepulchral
air, as though pronouncing doom. Then,
mocking Dorothy's serious face with a
little tumult of laughter, she went on.
"There; it's all decided now the way you
\u25a0wished. You are to refuse Count .Storri
and marry Mr. Storms without bestowing
either care or thought on what Mamma
Harley or Papa Harley or Uncle Pat may
say or do about it."
"Really, Bess, how much better you
have made me feel. After all, there's no
body like a wise, dear, true friend!"
"The value of such a friend is beyond
conjecture," returned the mocking Bess,
reassuming her tones of the oracle.
The memory of Richard's kisses on her
fingers never left Dorothy all that day
and all that night. Those fortunate lit
tle fingers seemed translated into some
thing rosily better and apart from her
self. And brow and ears and eyes and
cheeks and lips went envying those lucky
fingers; ar.d in the end the lips crept
upon them and kissed them for having
been kissed; perhaps with vague thoughts
Â«f robbing them of some portion of the
blissful wealth wherewith they had been
Invested. Richard, being male, for his
part thought the less about it, and went
simply meditating future sweet aggres
sions. And that shows the difference be
tween a man and a maid.
Richard, feeding his love with thoughts
cf Doroihy and his vanity with Ink, and
thereby gaining two mighty reasons for
living, began to keep earlier hours. He
turned out at nine o'clock Instead of
eleven and twelve, hours which had for
merly matched his languid fancy. These
energetic doings bred alarm in both Mat
zai and Mr. Pickv.ick, evoking snappish
protests from the latter, who, being of a
nocturnal turn, held that the day was
meant for sleep. On the morning after
he had been honored with the privilege
of the veranda door, Richard was borne
upon by something akin to gloom. This
feeling went with him from bed to bath,
end from bath to breakfast, and finally
walked with him all the way to the Har
ley house. He was willing to sacrifice the
Daily Tory and yoke himself personally
to the mills of Senator Hanway's de
signs; but he must see Dorothy. That
brightness was the bribe, unspoken and
unknown to all save himself, that had
brought him Into Washington and these
sundry and divers plots and counterplots
cf state. And now to be cheated through
the polite blundering of a gentleman, who
was co engaged in considering himself
that he had neither time nor eyes for
any # other. Richard swore roundly in
mental fashion at his contrary fate. And
yet he saw no way to better the situation;
and perforce, for this morning at least,
he was driven to push the bell of the
veranda door. He might have gone about
the ceremony with more cheer had he
known how he was to gain an ally in his
troubles; one, moreover, whose aid was
cure to prove effective.
As Senator Hanway's black messenger
ushered Richard into that statesman's
study, the radiant Dorothy perched at the
end of Senator Hanway's table, was the
picture that greeted his eyes. Our radi
ant one sought to stifle her effulgence be
neath a look severe and practical. This
expression of practical severity was a
failure, and served to render her more
dazzling.
"I have made up my mind," quoth Dor
othy, the moment Richard was Inside
the door, and speaking in the loud, dead
level monotone which she conceived to
be the voice for business conversations
as against the giggling, gurgling ups and
downs of conversations purely social, "I
have made up my mind to come In every
morning and help Uncle Pat. I'm tired of
being a useless incumbrance."
Delivering which, Dorothy wore the re
solved manner of a new Joan of Arc, who
had come seeking fields of politics rather
than those of war.
"And I have been of use to you. haven't
I, Uncle Pat?" demanded Dorothy.
"Of measureless use, dear," said Sena
tor Hanway. Then, turning to his sec
retary, who had taken a score of
letters shorthand and was about to
seek his own Quarters and run
them off upon the typewriter: "Have
those copied by 3 o'clock and bring
them here for signature."
Senator Hanway had no more than
Rriven Richard good morning when
Senator Loot was announced.
"He won't stajr long," said Senator
ALFRED
HENRY
LEWIS
... ... a
Hanway; but while he s here, dear,
\u25a0won't you take Mr. Storms into the li
brary?" The request was preferred to
Dorothy. _ '
"Yes." began Dorothy, when she and
Richard found themselves in the li
brary, and nothing to Interrupt j them
but the distant slumberous rumble of
Senator Loot. "Yes, I'm going to help
Uncle Pat. And I'm going to learn
how to be a newspaper woman, too.
I think every girl should be capable of
earning her own living. Not fhat I
expect to be obliged to do so; but it
is beÃt to be prepared." Dorothy's face
was funereal, as though disasters,
clawed and fanged, were roaming: the
thickets of the future, to spring upon
her. "So I shall learn the newspaper
trade; go In and be a writer as. you
are â only not so brilliant-j-and then, if
It were necessary, I could* earn my own
way." \u25a0
Now Richard knew these Industrious
resolutions to be the veriest webs of
subterfuge. Their duplicity was appar
ent, and they were spun for him. Dor
othy owned no thought of missing his
morning calls, and had met Senator
Hanway's courtesies of the veranda
door with a move in flank. The news
cocked up the spirits of Richard, ex
cessively, and gave to his Farnese
shoulders an Insolent swing as he
strutted up and down the library. Ho
had expected Dorothy to reproach him
for the soft violence done her fingers;
but she made no mention of it. Where
uponâin such manner do unchepked
iniquities multiply upon themselvesâ
Richard turned toward her with a
purpose of again outraging those little
fingers with the burden of a fresh ca
ress. The little fingers, grown weary,
however, were in discreet retirement
behind Dorothy, as, with her back to
the window, she stood facing him.
Defeated in his campaign against the
fingers before it had begun, Richard
was driven to discuss Dorothy's work
a-day resolves.
"Newspaper work? Do society, I
suppose?" â¢ .
Richard had got hold of the
Idioms of the craft and spoke of "doing
society" as thougn reared among the
types. . ~~; r-;-_7p.r -;-_7p.
"No, not society." and Dorothy shook
her head. "I'd pick 'em to pieces, the
minxes; and the papers don't want
that. No, I'm going to learn about
politics with Uncle Pat. I shall write
politics. You must teach me."
. Richard said he would.
"Only you should know," said he,
"that I need a deal of teaching my
self."
"But you can write!" cried Dor
othy, her hands emerging from their
â¢retreat to clasp each other in a
glow of admiration. "I've read; your
letters. They remind me of Carlyle's
'French Revolution.' "
â¢ This staggered Richard; was his idol
laughing at him? A glance into her
eyes showed only a darkened enthusi
asm; whereat Richard puffed and
swelled. Perhaps his Daily Tory let
ters did have the rhetorical tread of
the Scotchman's masterpiece. In any
event it was pleasant to have Dorothy
think so. Before he could frame his
modesty to fit reply, tfce cumbrous re
treat of Senator Loot was overheard.
"Now we must go back," said Doro
thy.
"May I have a rose?' asked Richard,
pointing to his blushing consignment
of that day, where they luxuriated in a
giant vase.
"Don't touch my hands!" cried Doro
thy fiercely, whipping them behind her.
Richard gave his humble parole that
he would not touch her hands. Being
reassured, Dorothy pinned a bud in his
lapel. The little fingers were so fondly
confident of safety that they made no
haste in these labors of the bud. Their
confidence went unabused; Richard ad
hered to his parole and never touched
them.
- "I'm glad you can keep your prom
ise!" said Dorothy, pouting- from pure
delight.
Later, the pair made love to one an
other with their eyes across the digni
fied desk of Senator Hanway, while that
statesman told Richard matters to the
detriment of Mr. Hawke's canvass for a
Speakership and Governor Obstinate's
claims upon a Presidency, of which,
through the medium of the Daily. Tory,
he believed the public should be: in
formed.
"My dear Dorothy," observed the
sibyl of the goMcn locks, when the
other related how faithfully Richard
had kept his compact concerning her
fingers, "you ought never to make a
man promise the thing you do not
want. They are such dullards; besides,
they have a passion for keeping their
word."
The President and General Attorney
and thirty- two underling attorneys of
the Anaconda Airline, in accord with
Mr. Gwynn's request, descended upon
Washington. The thirty-two underling
attorneys, coming to town- by twos and
threes, were amazed when they found a
gathering of the Anaconda Airline
clans. They collected In groups and
clots at the Shoreham, the Arlington
and Willard's to discuss their amaze
ment.
The President and General Attorney,
if they were smitten of wonder, con
cealed it, and within the ~ hour' after
their arrival rang the doorbell- of Mr.
Gwynn. They were ushered. into a room
the tamed splendors of whlchtold the
thoroug*h taste that had conceived it.
Then their cards went ; u\> to 1 Mr.
Gwynn.
Word came back that Mr. Gwynn was
deeply engaged. Would the President
and the General Attorney of the Anacon
da Airline call again in an hour? The
president and . general attorney had
for long harbored a theory â¢ that , Mr.
Gwynn was the greatest man on earth.
Now they knew -It; the fact -was dis
played beyondy dispute^ by. his .failure
to instantly; see " them. The president
and general attorney ' withdrew,* silent
in their awe, and Mr.; Gwynn dispatch-,
ed Matzai to ; find? Richard. j;i^ . i;
On the hour's even stroke, the pres-
ident and general attorney were, again
at Mr. Gwynn's. That personage was
still unable to meet them; however, he
sent Richard with written excuses ;for
his absence and the suggestion that
Richard, speaking in his place, would
put them in possession of hla wishes.
"Mr. Gwynn desired to say," observed
Richard, "that Anaconda Airline inter
ests deeply depend upon: Mr. Frost for
Speaker." \u25a0 ; :.\u25a0 . \u25a0â¢. ; ..--- .- ": ;:\u25a0'\u25a0 i
"What we've said from the begin
ning!" remarked the president to. the
general, attorney.
"Precisely what we've said!" ob
served the general, attorney.
They had said nothing on that point;
but they were too. well drilled- in their
own interests' to fail of complete coin-;
cidence with a gentleman who could
call a special shareholders' meeting,
elect a new directory, -and .revise the
entire official family of the Anaconda
Airline within any, given thirty, days.
"Mr. Gwynn asks you,: then," V said
Richard,-, "since you : and. he: agree on
the propriety* of Mr. Frost for Speak
er, to consult with Senator Hanway."
And now, the-Anaconda Airline was
in the war for the House gavel. Under
the. supervision of Senator; Hanway, ,;t
brought Its whole smothering; weight
to bear upon the Hawke twenty or
-those twenty-three whose districts v
dominated. The Hawke twenty wrig
gled and writhed, but in the end; gave
way â all save a rock-ribbed quartet.
They must stay by. the standards of
Mr. Hawke.
"Our constituents will destroy us if
we don't," said they. ' : :
"The Anaconda will destroy' you if
you do," was the: blunt retort of the
general attorney. T â¢
The four stood firm, and were black
listed for slaughter fat the, polls a year
away, , at which ' .tlriie they were faith
fully knocked on the head. Sixteen of
the twenty went over to Mr.Frost; the
president of the Anaconda Airline came
out In an interview in. the Daily; Tory
and said that the shift of the excellent
sixteen was a popular victory.
It* was two. days "before. the caucus!.
The line-up of forces. Frost again3t
Hawke, Hanway against Obstinate,
under able captains went vigorously
forward. It pleased^ Senator Hatt-vjy
to hear that the Frost , for
tunes were being ''unexpectedly
served by the volcanic 'Mr. Hawke
himself. That gentleman had falleu:2nto
a state of indignant eruption;; his best
friends could not approach him because
of the smoke and flame ~ and la va.which*
his rage cast up}, .-..;'
"The most scoundrel thing I: ever saw
in Washington is.n.at I am made to fight:
for the Spea-kership ! 'cried the eruptive
Air. Hawke; and this of outburst
does not help any. man's, caused '";i ' \u25a0\u25a0 *,*\u25a0'.
To steal a simile from a dead gentle
man who stole from others in: his 'day,
Mr. j Hawke went into, the final battle of
the caucus much after the manner where
with a horse approaches a^drum,; that is,
with a deal of prance and but little prog
ress, and, for the most part, \ wrong end
f oreniost. \u25a0 Even then ; the | count of \u25a0 Sena
tor Hanwayâ a cold- flooded computation
â gave that' gavel to ; the';", violent -: Mr.
Hawite. So much for being a House
leader, a tariff monger and a friend of
Governor Obstinate.;
On the afternoon before the caucus Sen
ator Hanway took a 'last look .at the ar
ray. Besides Mr. j Hawke and Mr. - Frost,
there were two ", .other carididates,' . Mr.
j^atch and Mr.. Swinger. These latter had
been sent Into' the lists by the diplomacy
of Senator Hanway to 'hold the; delega
tions from their States, a majority where
of, if released, would fly; to Mr. Hawke.
With all four- name's ; before the caucus,
Mr. Frost would lead Mr. : Hawke by two
without having a majority. Eliminate Mr.
Patch and Mr. Swinger, however, and Mr.
Hawko would be chosen a majority of
seven. And, while the { battle might jbe
made to stagger on ; through" forty bal
lots, in the end A-r.* Patch and iir. Swing
er must perf orcelwlthdraw. They/ could
give no excuse for holding _ on "forever in

CHAPTER VI.
Ho-w Storri Hod a' Vivid Imagination.
Storri had no more, of moral nature
than haSa tiger, or a kite. He was found
ed upon, no Integrity, would keep faith
with no one* save himself. Storri was not
a moral -lunatic, jf or that would suppose
some original morality and its subversion
to insane alms; rather he was the moral
idiot. At that, his imbecility paused with
his : morals;- in what a world calls busi
ness he was notably, bright and forward.
Storri was. of education, had traveled
.wide and 1 far, as ones of hia predatory
stariip are prone to , do, and with a Rus
sian, facility for tongues spoke English,
German, French, and half the languages
of Europe. , i The instinctive "purpose of
Storri's existence was to make money.
To him money "was a prey and stood as
do deer to wolves: and yet, making a fine
distinction, \ he was rapacious, not avari
cious. . -Avarice includes some idea of a
, storckoeping- commerce that amasses by
\u25a0buying. for : Sl" and selling- for, |2. Stoni
! would have failed at that. He waa.rapa
; clous as fhe pirate Is rapacious, and v/Hh
\u25a0a.gambler's love for*, the, uncertain, he
balked at anything; wbereo* the ; possible
profits were cut and "dried. .lie wanted to
"win." but "ho 1 was * willing/to lose If he
must; and above all he distrusted the
notion of a* limit.- ; Like^every wild thing
Storri -shied at^ a fence and loved the
While ..Storri- knew nothing
of honesty; he preferred; his s gold on legit
imate lines. This "leaning toward the
lawful came not from any bias of probity;
Storri simply wanted to be safe, having
avhoVror.;of?chains;;and t bolts and cages
and striped garments. ' /
When Storrl arrived in Washington hÂ«
came from Canada by way of New York.
The : year before he had been in Paria.
and was somethingâ not for longâ of a
figure on the Bourse. He had been in
every capital of Asia and Europe, and all
the while his restless eye sleepless in its
search for money .'
: Gifted with an imagination. Storri
evolved a scheme. Starting in moder
ation, it grew with his wanderings
'until, link upon link, it became endless
and belted the earth. Storri's Imagin
ation was like a .tar barrel; accident
migLt &et fire to it, but once in thea*.
least of flame it must burn on and on.Â£^
Tvith.; no power of self -extinguishment. #â - f l
until it burned itself out. Or it was
like him who. given a. halter, straight
way takes a horse.
It Is the theory of Europe that Amer
icans" are maniacs of money. European
conservatism draws a money-line be
yond which it will not pass. Whea any
man of Europe has a proposal of busi
ness too bis for the European mouth
wearing its self-imposed half-muzzle of
conservatismâ that promoter and his pro
posal head for America. It was this which
gained Washington {he advantage of a
visit from Storri; bis stop in Canada
being a six months' stay ia Ottawaâ was
only preliminary to his coming nere.
H-hlle his own people of Russia drew
back from those enterprises which Storri a .
agile imagination had in train, the Gov
ernment at St. Petersburg m what was
perhaps a natural hope that he might
find Americans more rackless. endowed
him as he came away with a guarded pat
on the back. The St. Petersburg Govern
ment advised its representatives In Amer
ica to introduce without indorsing Storrff
Storri was by no means wise after the
mnnnT of a Franklin or a Humboldt or a
Herscbel: but he did possess the deep
sacioncy of the serpent: or the fox. :He
owned inborn traits to steal and creep
upon his prey oi money. . Being in Wash
ington and looking up and down, hewas
quick to note the strategic propriety of
an alliance with Mr. llarley. Mr. Harley
had connections with "American - million
aires; mestof all. he was the alter \u25a0 ego
of a powerful Congressional figure. Storrt
could talk with Mr.; Harley; Mr. Harley^.
could tall: with Senator Hanway. ' Sincsr
Congre-3 would be required for the suc
cess of Storrl's plans, this last was to be
of prime importance.
(Continued next Sunday.)WHAT THE CHRISTMAS
SHOPPER DOES TO
THE SHOP GIRL
HELEN DARE
t . H. yes,* says the brown-eyed
I j Â£ 4 rl in the crockery depart-
V 7 ment. "Oh. dear, yes; men
come in looking for Christmas
presents. Eut they don't SHOP.
THET come in to BUY!"
Thus the po!nt that might be a mooted
prjoint is settled at once and forever:
The Christmas shopper is of the eternal
feminine.
Of the forty shop girls, m&re or less,
who. let me say en passant, call them
eelves "saleswomen" with fitting good
stxse, that I interview for the Christmas
Â«hoj>pers' Iniquitiesâ and her virtues, if
anyâ every one unhesitatingly designates
the Christmas shopper as "she."
And yet the very first thing I discover,
that in truth I cannot sidestep any, more
than you can escape a rocking-chair in
the dark when you come in quietly and
discreetly after the last car, and some
one has moved the matchesâ the very
first iniquity I bump into is a masculine
Iniquity. *
The man shopper, as a class, at Christ
mas time does not exist. He is sporadic
and incidental, as intermittent as the rai
sins In a sailor's plum duff, and, as a
matter of fact. Is not deserving of the
title of shopper at all.
When he cannot cajole or bribe or bully
some amiably disposed woman friend or
relative into doing his Christmas shop
ping for him, and at last has to make
the venture for himself or take to the
* -woods, his bed or his club during the
"colly holidays, what does he do, sly dog?.
Will it do to tell. I wonder?
Should a secret like that be kept during
this season of good cheerâ and peace on
earth?
Will it raise ructions in otherwise hap
py families to let the cat out of the bag?
I share, while 1 have it, the delicious
aniicij>atcry sensations of the small boy
with a match* in one handâ an as yet
unllghled matchâ and a can of powder In
the other.
"PcchV so goes the reasoning of the
nnaU bey reckless cf consequences, "why
not?"
And. affer all. 'it is the brown-eyed girl
in the crockery department who gives
â¢â¢U-fac!Â» T j. man comes in to buy a
Christinas; present, *' she says, "he has
only a notion "of what he wantsâ and we
do the ri'st. Perhaps he comes in for
a dinner set to give to his wife, and he
hasn't the slightest idea of what kind.
Sometimes his wife has been clever
enough to helD him out, so he tells the
saleswoman he wants a dinner set. and
that his wife likes dainty decoration, or
prefers blue in color or green, or what
ever it is. Then she finds out how much
money he is willing to spend and picks
out something for him.
"Perhaps he hasn't even a notion of
what he wants except that It is some
thing In china: then the saleswoman has
to find out not only how much money he
< wants to spend but what kind of a per
son the gift Is for, whether she is young
or old, a housewife or a woman without
a household. She suggests something for
the table or the bureau, or perhaps a
lamp or an ornament; then, that being
decided, the class of article fixed upon,
phe finds the article itself and sells it to
him."
"And so "
The brown eyes of the girl in the
crockery department sparkle with fun.
"And so," she agrees, "the saleswomen
really pick out most of the Christmas
presents that men give."
Casual observation shows me that the
girl In* the crockery department is right.
I linger a moment at the neckwear
counter because a big, unhappy man Is
there.
"I want," says he, miserably and
doubtfully, throwing himself upon the
mercies of a friendly looking- girl, "I
\u25a0want some of tthosee â cr â ah â Oh, you
know â those cat smeller things .you'
women wear on your necks."
"Oh, yes; pussy whiskers," interprets
the friendly girl with fine composure, un
covering a box of them. "Here they are.
What color? How many?"
He shakes his head, speechlessly.
She extracts from him, almost pain
lessly, Important facts as to complexion,
Vge, etc.. and selects his trifling present
â¢accordingly.
So, too. does the tactful young wo
man who handles fluffy tea gowns. A
young: man affecting much more ease
than he feels asks airily for a tea-;
gown, just "a teagown," and his taste
Inclines to red because the brunette
young woman displaying it from her
shoulders is resplendent in one of
â¢!iat color. But she ?3ves him. and
the feelings of the blonde somebody
who will wear it, by judicious investi
gation and suggestion.
Thus, you, see. the beautiful some
thing or other that arrives on the
mprnlns of December 25 "for Mary,
with love and a merrx Christmas,
from John." is not dear John's thought
ful selection at all. at all. but the
choice of another woman â Oh! porish
Now I' wish I hadn't let the cat out
Still the man who does his own
buying is a mere incident in the
Christinas chopping â a bobbing cork on
the tidal wave that sweeps the Christ
mas bargain counter. 41 , and we -will not
i oncorn ourselves v.-tth him.
Let him stay safely out of the Lat
tlfc for bargains â merely, earning the
fAj-vs of war. lucky fellow.
â¢rfcristmris shopping has grown to be
2. tremendous event.
Do you know that in the down
town stores â in only the larger stores
of the city â there are more than 10,000
people employed in selling' and deliver
ing: things to the Christmas shoppers. \u25a0
Are you doubtful?
Then take a peep, at the figures..
In the Emporium alone there are
1600 salesmen and ... jrlrls, wrappers,
shippers, drivers, etc.
Hale Brothers have a force of about '
1000. ; â¢'\u25a0' '.-'.:\u25ba--/;' ii>^*^
Praeger's are keeping 1200 busy" all
day and half the night during the
weeks before Christmas... "#V^
Over 600 are selling things at the
White House.
With these figures in' your- mind do
a little computing on your own ac-\ .
count as you walk the blocks of hand
some shop fronts en our business \u25a0
. streets.
For their Christmas trade Praeger's
take on about 500 or 600 new em
ployes, the White House an extra 250
or SOO, the Emporium 600 to 700.
â¢Christmas Bhopping has its strenu-
osity, your wife or your sister, your
mother or your daughter, tells you
when she comes horne â late for dinner
â with her hat and her temper awry.
Christmas shopping, telephones the
only girl in the world, makes it quite
impossible for her to be at home to
you to-night, as usual. "Such nerves,"
and, "Oh, such a splitting headache!'
and she is going to bed Immediately
after dinner, so she may get an. early
start for another's day's raid on the
counters and shelves to-morrow.
If the woman who does the buying
for one finds it arduous, how does the
woman who sells to the many find It?
What does Christmas shopping and
the Christmas shopper do to the shop
girl?
"Oh!" says the girl at the ribbon
counter, around which a perfect mael
strom of Christmas shoppers seethes
and eddies, for what would Christmas
be without Christmas ribbons?
"Oh-h-h! I couldn't begin to tellyou.
"There's the woman who is making
her presents for Christmas â opera bags,
handkerchief cases, coat hangers and
things, and who isn't shopping to buy,
but jnst to get ideas. She looks at
everything In stock and asks for more.
She turns and twists and measures the
things and asks questions â and she's so
much more artful than she needs to be,
for we have no objections at all to tell
ing how our things In stock are made.
She takes up a lot of time â "
- "And patience?" ' â¢
The girl at the ribboncounter smiles,
diplomatically.
"And then, when she finally decides
to make a purchase of some* of the ma
terial', she asks, 'How much ' does it
take to make this bow?' "Five yards,'
1 tell her. 'FIVE yards!' she shrieks,
\u25a0Ha! ha! Five yards! I'll take TWO
yards.' Of course she doesn't SAY I
lie, but as it really' iloes take flve : yards
I get some satisfaction out- of it."
"You get even?"
â¢Well, she comes back in a few days
to match the ribbon, and .there Isn't
any more. There, really isn't, for wo
wouldn't hold it out on her. Oh,.' no;"
we're here to sell our stock, riot to hold
malice.
"There's the . woman . who comes to
match things to "a shade. Sometimes
she doesn't bring her samples, and she
isn't sure which kind of ribbon it is.
and after she's seen everything, she
thinks she'll wait until she" brings
the sample."
"There's the woman who buys on a
transfer and has her "purchases sent
home C. O. D. and will not receive
them, they have to be brought back.
"There's the woman who: has an;ac
count and lias things sent home,- and
after she lias examined. them and copied
them, and kept- them several-, days,
sends them back because she "has
'changed her" mind.'
"There's the woman . who ; looks at
twenty-seven kinds of pink baby rib
bon, pricing it by the" bolt, -and 'then
buys six cents' worth of the blue. Yes,
she really exists; that's no exaggera
tion.
"There's the confidential woman who
tells you till about what she is making
for her husband and -sons and daugh
ters, and asks you "how you think
they'll like their presents, you
think they'd rather have red and green
or blue and purple,' and, of, course, you
have to say something, . for; a saleswo
man's first duty is to be pleasant.
"There's .the ..woman \u25a0 .who ' reaches
over your customer's shoulder, 'tilts'- her
hat, musses her hair and- grabs the. ar
ticle you. are; showing \u25a0 her out: of your
hand, or, worse still, out of the cus
tomer's. It's strange. how many of her
there are in the world. \u2666
"There's the woman who gets 'angry
at yCfU for not:havinglwhat' she wants.
"There's the .woman who comes up
to you while you're selling something
to some one else and wants to know
where, well, say, the art department
is. You tell her. 'What!' she; says,
'That isn't where; it was the last time
I was here.. Second floor!: Have they,
silkoline there?' Because if they haveri't
I don't wantto go up.' /'There are about,
100.000.0f her. I think, and she belongs

can't tell her that." ;

she; means' , to 's pay .for* it. BBuyt y will she

She will examine $5 dolls and $10 dolls
ami 520 dolls with' carefulest attention,
and twitter over two-cent and two-bit
dolls, and after she's looked over dolls,
dressed' and- undressed, blonde and bru
nette.i wax, china, bisque and rag, she
will blandly say:
"I. think I'll take a 50-cent doll.**
Or else she'll sniff contemptuously and
turn away with "I saw ever so much finer
ones at .â- â 's, with real hair, for- 33
cents. I guess I'll go back-there."
Of course, the , girl at the . doll counter
doesn't fall ..upon her and smite her. She
doesn't'- snatch up despised " dolly, anfl
smash the new'winter hat in,' butâ :
Would youblame her if she did? Now â
would ;you? . ; .
.Especially if the sniffy lady were the

'.'Do you think," asks the doll shopper,
being a. fond .mamma, ''do you really

The real orgy, of the Christmas shopper,
after she gets away from the ribbon, the
china,' the; jewelry, the neckwear and the
bric-a-brac departments; Is in the toy de
partment and among thtr Christmas tree
ornaments.- Tired, imi>atleVit, panicky
over ; a depleted purse, she reaches a state
in which she doesn't care whether ' her
hat "Is on straight- or not -so long as the
thing she wants ' is in : sight . and she can
point it out over the] shoulder of the shop
per in- front of her. ' '\u25a0','\u25a0
-! It , Is in the /toy \u25a0 department that she
makes conditions and lays down the law
about delivering .things.; She buys Tom
my's coaster and Nellie's doll carriage ten
days before Christmas and says to the
shop \u25a0: girl, ,'so ; tha 'shop]: girl â says to me:
"Now,;besure not: to send, it to-morrow.
Send it the day. before Christmasâ just'
about dark. What . you won't send it "the
day before Christmas! Why not. I'd; like
.to,know? ri6h..yes:.*l'dr i6h..yes:.*I'd forgotten that it
comes oh Sundajv.this year. Well, then,
send -.it ; Saturday, the 20d." and not until
darkâ so ' Tommylwon't see it -coming in.
Andâ now, promise \u25a0me you'll tell the
driver yourselfâ have him bring it around
the back way. If he doesn't those chil
dren will just be. sure to see him, bring
ing it in, they're so smart, and thenâ "
' The shop -girl- promises, of course; and
then she does the best she can. She has
Tommy's coaster or Nellie' 9 doll carriage
put away in the room where such things
are held to await the day of delivery, and
Tommy and Nellie lie In wait and catch
the man carrying It in, and mamma tele
phones her indignation, unless, perchance,
the. line is busy carrying In some other
fond mamma's protests.
These are ; Just a few of the things
that the Christmas 'shopper does to the
shop girl' thoughtlessly.
One of the things she does for her is
occasion her employment. It Is because
of the Christmas shopper, and perhaps
became of her heedlessness and exac
tions, that, the several thousand "extra"
girls find employment during the Christ
\u25a0 mas shopping weeks, so that they In turn
may, become Christmas shoppers.
How, I ask the girl _at the' ribbon
counter, can a woman do her . Christmas
..-hopping with, the least wear and tear
on herself ami the shop girl? And her*
is what she says:

shall be a sign unto you; ye snail find the babe wrapped
in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger.' And suddenly
there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host,
liiiiiaing God, and saying, 'Glory to God in the highest, and
on earth peace, good will toward men.' " f Luke -.11:8-14-)
Beautiful legend from out of the past of long, long
ago! How oft it has been told: how many times repeated
by mother lips to the children at the knee; In tht; flies
glow of the family hearth how often it has been the,
inspiring theme that has quickened young hearts to a
new devotion; what willing martyrs hav*j died in Ifce
arena; and, on the other hand, wnat controversies h*ve
arisen, what deeds hayÂ© : been , perpetrated, what tragic
wars have been ruthlessly vaged irt the name of this
same "Prince of Peace.'' " *
I have called this a legendâ how far is it a legend?
Was he born on the day we celebrate? Probably at quite
a different season of the year. Was he -born In Bethlehem
of Judea? Probably not. posstMy at a Bethlehem in
Galilee, near Nazareth. Dio angels announce his birth
to the shepherds in the fields': Certainly not. Nor was
there a "heavenly nost prulalnj? God." Was he withaut
a human fai-her â the child or Mary by the Holy Ghost?
Xo, he was the natural son of Josepli and Mary â only later
times played tricks with his biography. .
Was his life a career of astonishing miracles? Not
miracles in the usual sense of tlie word, but perhaps many
manifestations of unusual psychic oower â a power that
did not differentiate him from other men. And yet, the
anniversary of his birth is sacred to us.
Ought I to say. "And yet it Is sacred to us." as though
I would suggest that when we have found hi.m a man
the anniversary of his birth might be less sacred? Not
so. It Is more sacred, infinitely more sacred than though
in somo mystical way he had been other than man.
I wish we could so back to that cradle in Palestine
and rescue that babe from the- toils- of human mistrust
of human nature; could see him grow to manhood among
the hills of Galilee: could watch the unfolding of a mind
precious and esthetic; could discern the impressionable
temperament molded by "the life and- thought of his peo
ple; could study him as he -drank.: in from field, forest
and flower the message: of_..natu.re:- could -go v.'ith .'him to
the carpenter's bench \u25a0'and -watch ' him as , he plied his
tools; could sit by him \u25a0 : as- : he ; memorized his â¢ Hebrew
scriptures; could- behold \u25a0:. the ; swjepln_ess of 'his filial de
votion; could meditate .with him as, communing with the
Inner self, he, discovered' the deepest laws of the deepest
life; could stand among the first group of interested listen
ers; could herald the news of the young sage and philos
opher who had studied life in the light of the passions,
aspirations and amictions of the human heart, and, there
fore, had a message vital and practical.
Could we thus go back we should find .a Galilean
peasant â simple, modest, unassuming, retrospective yet
observant, intense in his # zeal, a lover of men, broad in
his sympathies, profound in' his knowledge ot life; devoted
to the highest moral and spiritual. welfare of his nation,
one who knew no land but his own. was hot versed in
the sciences or arts of the day. was not a student of
literature â a "simple man. but one with a great purpose.
I said the anniversary of his birth is sacred to vs â
it Is sacred â rrfade so by. the life which was motived 1 by a
great purpose â the greatest purpose possibleâ the "service
of men. Benjamin Franklin prayed ekch. ptarning that
ho might be privileged to render unto God the only service
possible for the many benefits â¢ bestowed upon~him; he
prayed that he might be of use to. his, fellow men.
Emerson said, "Make yourself : .necessary to the
world and mankind will give you your bread." Mrs.
Humphry Ward baa said. "Teach our young men how
to adore and suffer for a great idea." .. . .. , â¢

K-^ called upon to organize a club herself. Before
she can settle the matter she . should consider
something of tnc origin' and meaning of the club move

pressure upon good men. -The -number of < those who are
able, honest and industrious: is. small â yet upon, them de
volves the main burden of : the world's affairs.
It is plain that our educated men arefar too busy. It is
the commonest of complaints among middle-aged women
that their husbands are so tired .when- they come home at

receptions or gatherings of any]klnd/ . , : ' .
And not only "society," so called, has to get along with

his bread: he had a great idea and willingly suffered
for it. -"
What â¢ grander motive can there be in life than to
feel impelled to express- to men a 'message' of sweetness,
love and simplicity such as ravished the soul of the man
of Galilee? No ambition to achieve the things that pass
with the lapse of days can compare with this motive.
And it was because he. had caught the vision' of the in
ner soul In its entrancing beauty that he dared to speak
with a conviction whose authority astonished his hear
ers and whose intensity convinced many.
Jesus was an inspirer of men and this is the great
est of services to men.
If we can but feel that all in life has a purpose: if
we can but lighten the monotony by glorifying the task;
if v/e can but find beauty everywhere and the good ..In
all things; if -we can but love our enemies and do good
to those who persecute usâ we shall have discovered a
sublimity In life such as we have not hitherto permitted
ourselves to perceive. Â«

Christmas is surrounded with a halo of sentiment.
He who wants to be matter of fact let him be, but the'
human heart is iyiturally sentimental.
About two years ago one of our dailies published an
article by some eminent professor in which cuts repre-
little help from the busy lawyers, doctors and business
men, but the administration of the great private charities,
many minor, municipal duties, mos^of the training of the
children, and the entire conduct of the household, have"
been turned over to the women. Possibly there should be .
Included. in this list the whole religious polity of tho com
munityâsince even church: officers confess that they de
pend upon their wives to tell them what ought to be done
In church matters. \u25a0 - . . \u25a0 .-.
In response to, this great demand women's clubs began
to spring up about thirty, years ago. The first to organize ..
and. declare themselves -were in New York, Boston. Phila

State of California. The land of romance, associated
with the legends of the padres and the tales of the
days of '49. California has been looked upon as the
place of big trees, big mines, big ranches, big moun
tains, big stories. To the rest of the country she haa been.
In a way. the Ultima Thule. to be wondered at because of
the big things she had, but on account of her great dis
tance from the centers of population, to be only dreamed
of. but never, until very lately, seriously considered as a
place to which to emigrate. \u25a0_ 1 >' â â¢ . . \u25a0 :
Bret Harte, with his wonderfully picturesque descriptive
powers, did much to implant in the minds of his millions
of eager readers the idea that California was made up of
"Poker flats" and that outside of a few of .our larger cities
the stage coach was our only means of communication.
The talcs of our great mines, our cloudless summers, our
big trees, our rather Questionable morals' and our" strange,
almost uncouth, manners and customs, all Jumbled together
in the public mind, did much to retard the advancement
of the State, did much to keep at home those who, had
they known the truth, would, long ago, have cast their lots
with us. - :. ." .
When once the popular mind imbibes an idea concern
ing any locality It requires much time and evidence to
change that idea. Many of our pioneers/ . for instance,
brought with them the notion Daniel Webster had. when,
balancing on his ; flnger tip a copper cent, he said that; all
of California was not worth so much as that. And, coming
here with that Idea, their only notion vvas.'to take \ a few
thousand dollars' worth of the gold they thought lay so
easy to the hand and then co back to civilization and their
homes. But our genial climate, fertile soil and the charm
that California has for all who spend a year within her
borders, quickly changed their notions of her worth- and
wealth. Coming to pay her but a short and mercenary
visit, enamored of her many charms, they could not tear
themselves away.
Fifty-six years ago they ' were those who prophesied
that California would, one day, be a great' State. But if
any one had then been brave enough to \u25a0 say that in 1905
there would be near 2,000,000 of people in the State; that
on the sand dunes by the Golden Gate there would be nigh
half a' million San FranciEcans; that at the Pueblo of Los
Angeles there would be a great city, of near 200,000 happy
and prosperous people; that our great valleys would be
dotted over with vine and fig tree, oranges and lemons;
that half a hundred thousand cars, such as no man then
had seep or dreamed of. would be required to take away
the products of our vineyards and our orchards; that our
mines would, at the end of half a century, be only partly
opened up; that our great forests would supply near half
our lan-I with lumber; that to us the frozen winters and
the pitiless summers of the East would drive their people
in great pilgrimages, untii, for well and sick, for old and
youns. for strong and weak, for poor and rich, our Cali
fornia's name would be the lodegtone to attract " them
hither; that the great Pacific, leading on to lands then
thought as too far away for any but the most adven
turous to achieve, would soon become the most; regarded
niarine highway of the world â had any prophet, half a cen
tury ago, .-been wise.^enough, or being wise enough; -had
been also brave enough, to- thus foresee and foretell the
near future, he would, indeed, have been looked Â« upon -.as
one who dreamed dreams that might, perchance', come true,
but only after many, many decennaries of California's"
statehood had been celebrated. " ;. t
Who then would have believed that, climbing up the
scarps of the Sierras there would be to-day a railway now
already nearlj r forty years of age? Who theh would have
credited a prophecy that the entire -750 north and south
miles of our State would echo to the clank of passing
trains? And he who then would have said that four great
transcontinental railway lines could not now easily trans
port our traffic, our visitors and ourselves, would.- no doubt,
have been regarded as a fit subject for restraint. ;
What haa California to be thankful for" at the end of
thia year of our Lord 1905? Let him who asks the ques
tion look about him. Let hlmregard the fast spreading
of our Irrigated acres. Let him look at the mammoth
ateamshlps coming and going from our ports, each capable
of carrying what a fleet a half -century ago could not ac
commodate, and atill not capable of taking all we. have to
offer them. Let him liaten to the locomotives, wheezing
under their too heavy loads. LÂ«t him cast his eyes upon

twice before him within a short period inquire into the
circumstances. And the ' registrar reinforced my pon-;
science by reminding me that the penalty for administer
lending himself to the violation of law was transporta- ,
tion or aomething equivalent to that ancient puniahment.
Greatly quickened, partly by my seal for; morality, partly
by a reasonable fear of coneeauences, I: determined to
watch with the eye of a detective very couple that; came
Into my room bent on marriage and to deal firmly : with
any miscreants I could discover. k #

They came Into the room with emphaala^-four people,^

In iron. After a salutation guarded on my^part, for that
registrar had saturated my mind with suspicion, and
somewhat aggressive on their part, which - ; was a shield
wherewith to protect an unusual situation, they sat down
In a row near the door, while I sat downlatthe table with
the light behind me and falling on their; facesâ which la

"Those are your papers? Well, let me see that they
are all richt. You are James McKittrick?"
The bridegroom indicated that' he was wlth^ some
spirit, and with the air of one; who waa entering on a;,

as a facetious as well as a determined person. by; the group.
"And you are Euphemla Lumsden?" I. continued .with >,

A Suspicion.
\ f As this line of conversation was threatening to Involve
the whole company in a conflagration I commanded silence
â still playing the magistrateâ and began to read 'over
the papers, and I did so to compare the details before
me with the appearance of the people. For sometime I
had been haunted with the idea that I had seen the
bridegroom before, for his face was one you did: not
readily forget, and with every minute this Idea was
deepening into conviction. His broad chest, hia strong
legs and arms, his bold looks, his forward manner, his
air of good humor, his general suggestion of , gay reck
lessness ; corresponded with some photograph of: the past
that I was carrying.; in my. memory. Could it be that
this was one of thoserDqn Juans In -humble life against
whom I ; had been warned? One could see that he '/\u25a0 was

In early May or June'to take her
to all the good ; youngsters In- the (lanÂ«l( lanÂ«l
as soon as the snow began to fly ami
the holly berries to turn a saucy, In
viting red.
So she's traveling along at a merry
rate, alternately scolding the reindeer
for not running laster and counting
the merry jingle of the bells, for It
takes a long, long time to get out of
Christmas land into the civilized world
where srown-up people tlTink thatdollss
are niertly made of kid and sawdust
and have no power or ability to thlnlt
and act like really, truly people-^-that
is, when they j;et a chance.
But between you and me, dolls are ex
actly as proud, exactly as conceited an.i
exactly as hard to please as any one
possibly could be ami the trouble is,
they are getting more fastidious every
year.
Her . wardrobe? Why bless you, it's
guile as extensive as the most elabor
ately gowned boclety buda" and; her
personal belongings are quite enough.'
to make an ordinary uiortal turn green
with sheer envy.
In the first place Miss Doll-Baby-
Lady is qulti; a creation in herself. She
stands some turce or four feet high
and revels in the clothing of. a minia
ture lady who can do more than clo.-Â»o
and open her t-yes and call "ma-ma,
pa-pa." at the toy of a wee high voice.
Her body !s made of a. soft, pliable kid,
which stands more wear and tear thua
anything tlse % uniess it is a hard com
position, and her face and head are
fashioned of bisque or china that is
guaranteed to withstand the ravages of
soap and water. \u25a0\u25a0 . -* .-:.\ \u25a0\u25a0_'.â¢\u25a0.
But Miss Doll-Baby-Lady's chief
beauty lies, like mauy another wom
an's, in her wealth of curly, soft hair
and In her finely arched eyebrows and
daintily fringed lids that permit her
eyes to oi>en find close and say all sorts
of unutterable, pretty things.
Ah, she's a treasure, is this doll of
Chrisumistide. and as long as she is so
retching and dainty and sweet, it seems
more than, a shame not to array her
in cloth of ,gold and anoint her with
myrrh and sweet smelling perfumes, for
she seems born to the life that does
not stay awake at nights to see how
far the pennies can be stretched..
The doll of to-day has iour stages
through which she passes. In the first
place she plays the infant role and she
plays It so well that It requires more
than a passing glance to discover her
little tricks.
Her gowns may be numerous ana
varied, but as a rule they consist of
the very elaborate and the simply plain.
Ordinarily, nainsook' slips, perfectly
straight and innocent of a single frill,
are her every-day clothes, and, by the
way, her particular pet aversion: but
when Sundays come she prinks and
dresses herself In beautiful, heavy
corded silks und real lace that Is wortli
a small fortune a yard.
Be it known to the uninitiated all
this fuss and frill belongs to a long
coat that completely covers her, plain
ness and gives her every appearance of
belonging to the comfortable class of
bulging pocket-books.
The cloak, us I said before, is made
of a beautiful white or cream colored
heavy ribbed silk. The fullness comes
from a wee yoke that Is more than cov
ered with an elaborate lace' chiffon
edged cape. This cape, by the way, is
every bit as carefully fashioned as the
most expensive opera garment. First
comes the plllc. then cloth of chiffon
with a fluffy ruffle and last, but by no
means least, the lace, which, of courso,
adds the finishing touches and really
makes the cloak. The softest kind of
silk lines this small cape ami it is fast
ened to the cloak proper with a great
bow and streaming ends of double
faced satin ribbon.
Naturally such a chic garment needs a
bonnet built expressly for It, for anything
and everything seems sadly out of place.
So milady has the same silken fabric
fashioned into a snug-fitting French cap,
with the crown of lace ,to match the
crepe. And she doesn't stop there, either.
Tiny fox heads of a beautiful brown, are
lined air about her face, and when' the
bow Is tied almost under her left" ear
6he is lovely enough to gladden the heart
of any one who chances to see her.
The long clothes are dainty and sweet,
but she gets so awfully tired of them
that it is quite as well to supply her with
short clothes, too, else she twists and
turns In such an unaccountable way that
she makes a decided' nuisance of herself.
From the kid out she needs to be re
plenished. Soft woolen or silken under-

WHEN I was a schoolgirl we
used to look* forward with
great anticipation to our
iÃsy| annual school exhibitions.
I do not know why the pow
ers that were then in authority
made a distinction between a girl's
reading her own essay and a- girl's
reciting a poem by somebody else, but
this they did. Boys were required to
declaim and great stress was laid in
their education on the cultivation of
ease before an audience. But we girls,
as a rule, sat modestly in the front
seats of the chapel, in our white frocks,
while members of the school commit
tee or local clergyman read our com
positions for us. In the ideal of that
day woman's place was in the sweet
shelter and beautiful background of
her home, and young \u25a0 girls were not,
vests, either low-necked and sleeveless or :
high and 6nug, are her first demand. Then \,
stockings, or, better still, English socks '
and sandals orpumps, and then a quan-.
tity of petticoats, both for warmth and - :
for pretty. The flannel ones are never:
plain â oh, bless you, no; for she isn't an
ordinary child, by any manner of means,
and her feelinjjs would be decidedly In
jured if anything but the- most daintily
embroidered wcr.e'even considered 'for a'
second. The rosehuds are dotted. 'here
and there and a twining; leaf ;\u25a0 or vlner
makes the body of' the design. Of course,'
tho bottom of the skirt, is finished in the
regulation .scallop fashion arid the skirt
Itself Is put on a waist of linen or. lawn ;,
which buttons up the \ back, j One thing
mere she Insists upon in _-; this skirt.;
French seams are not quite good enough;
so she has' a small' feather, stitch of silk. \u25a0
covering, each and every one, that gives
It an exquisite finish. -. â¢. .
Her lawn petticoats, are every bit as
dainty, and many of them are made in '
sets to match her frocks. For instance.',
if. her Rown Is embroidered it would
never, never do to have even a suspicion
of lace \u25a0 peeping from under it. " So for
hand wcrk she has the same idea carried
.out on a less elaborate scale, though it
- never could be termed the- essence of
simplicity. ', . \u25a0 . t -"â¢.â¢;â¢â¢.'
While the frocks themselves are many,
she has but little choice as to. the style,

she never.was afraid of a vacant space

hesitated , and shrunk from crossing a

to the merry pealing of the Christ

r happy smile played round her
lips, .though the moan of the sea rose
up through the darkness and the Storm

granite walls.

and saw there a Merman, the King of
the Sea-people, who had fallen in love
with her.
The Merman, who thought the Prin

ever seen, begged her to come and live
with him beneath tue sea. When he
tola her of the merry lives of the Mer
xnalds end their wonderful home in the
bed of the ocean, the Princess said she
would like to join them, and wedding
the Merman she 'dwelt with him be

But coon she grew tired of the grot

Begged them to let her return to her
home on the earth. They would not,
however, allow her to leave them, and
the princess? filled with sorrow, pined
away and died of a broken heart, leav
ing behind her a little blue-eyed daugh
ter as beautiful as herself.
This child was brought up by the
Mermaids, who called her Princess Sea-
Foam, and taught her to swim", dive
and float in the water, to play on a
golden lyre, and to sing entrancing
melodies.
They wove for their beautiful dresses

One night, when ebe had grown into a
beautiful young maiden, she climbed up
the winding path on the cliff and peeped
through the windows of a tiny church
that overlooked the sea.
It was Christmas eve. and the building
was decorated with flowers and holly,
while a. silver star glittering in the lamp
light hung above the shining altar. While
she stood there, her blue eyes wide with
wonder, the notes of the organ pealed
forth and children's voices sang a Christ

The Princess felt a. strange Badness

maid west sadly away, and floating alone
on the waves listened tv the chiming of
the Christmas bells.
I-ater she sought the Grandmother of
the Mermaids, who, though very old,
looked young and beautiful, and told her
all her thoughts and feelings.
"Why da the bells ring? â¢ What is the
silver star?" she lnauired.
Then the Mermaid, who was ever so
wise, explained the festival of Christmas
and said that the silver star pointed the
way to a beautiful land where mortals
dwelt, when their life on earth was
ended.
"AlaE:** she cried, "we Mermaids have
not a eecond life. We live for three hun
dred year*, and having no soul become
loam or sea spray."
"Bat you," she said to the little Prin
cess, "are more fortunate. Being the
daughter of a mortal you possess part of
a soul," ana ehe briefly told her her
mother's story.
"Then shall I, too, go to the land of
the silver star, where my mother awaits
me?? asked the Princess.
"You will if you can win the rest of
your soul." said the ancient Mermaid;
s< and this I will help you to do. In the
tall tower at the mouth of the river," she
continued, "lives the great magician, Lo
kio. Oo to him and ask his assistance.
He If so kind-hearted I am cure he will
help you. Tell him that Mother-o'-Pearl
Â«ent you to himâ that for her sake she
begs him to heli> ycu."
Bo next day the little Princess set oft
by herself and swam to the tower, where
the magician dweit in solitary state.
The entrance door was ajar, and
counting the winding staircase, she
reached a tiny turret chamber. There,
In a chair of ebony, sat the great ma
gician, an old man with thoughtful
eyes and a white beard that swept the
ground.
v He glanced kindly at the little sea
maid and asked why the had sought
him. When she told him her errand
he sighed and for a long time sat silent,
gazing into a crystal ball at his elbow.
Then, bidding Princess Sea-Foam
draw r.cur him, he looked steadfastly
into her clear blue eyes.
"Yes. it is quite possible for you to
gain the whole of your soul," he ex
claimed. "You are good, loving and
kind and your heart is pure and brave.
But have you thought of what you arc
giving up? Three hundred years of
happiness;, pcax.e and security for the
brief life, of an earth maiden."
"But in no other way can I reach the
Land of the Silver Star," said Princess
Sea-Foam; "aud I would far rather
<Iwell there than in the home of the
aiermaids."
â¢You must be loved by a mortal and
wed him .before you can gain a soul,
and ere this can happen It may chance
that you will be called upon to sur
render your life for 'that of another.
Are you ready to do this also?"
"Willingly, if only I can secure the
rest of my soul." replied the little
Sea-maid, bravely. "I would sooner be
loved by a mortal and live but a short
jf-iir;e on earth than as % a mermaid ;
\u'Â«H fÂ° r three hundred years among ;
the Sea-people." \
"Come to me again when four moons ]
have waned," said Loklo, "and I will j
tend you forth Into the world to gain

and when spring came she went again
to Lokio's tower.
Before leaving she bade farewell to
the Grandmother of the Mermaids, who
sent as a gilt to the magician five
snow-white sea cattle. To Princess Sea-
Foam she gave three oyster shells con
taining three beautiful dresses, one of
spangled star dust, one of sunset glow
and one of billow sea foam, embroidered
with moonbeams. Then the Princess,
driving the patient white oxen before
her. went to Lokio's tower and humbly
proffered her gift t> the great magi
cian.
Pleased with the present, Lokio did. all
in his power tn hely her. He pave her
a wonderful pair of golden sandals for
her feet and hung around her neck a
tfny golden locket containing a m*igic
crystal.
"On tho day that you win your ?=oul
this crystal will disappear," he. said. "Till
then do not Dart with it. As for the
frolden sandals, as long a? you wear them
you v.-ill never feel tired or weary." â¢

Princess Sea-Foam thought the earth a,
very delightful place. At every turn she
came upon something new and beautiful.
The violets clothing the mossy banks, thÂ°
golden gorse scenting the moor, the song
of the lark in the blue, all filled her with
joy and gladness. Now running, now
skipping, now dancing, she sped along
a moorland track, stopping sometimes to
gaze at the sheep grazing upon the heath,
the rabbits sporting among the bracken,
the white clouds drifting overhead, and
the purple shadows sweeping up the
emerald hillsides. Ami when she passed
a^tiuy stream foaming in white cascades
ov<r the lichened bou'.ders she clayycd
her hands with delight.
Soon she came to a wood of fresh srreen
larches and struck into a mossy path
winding beneath their tasseled branches.
Around her bloomed golden daffodils, yel
low primroses, starry anemones and white
and purple orchids. Sunbeams filtered
through the leaves, shadows flickered on
the boles of the tre?s. while blackbirds
and thrushes caroled gayly among the
breeze-swayed branches.
"Cuckoo! Cuckoo!" called the pray
bird of spring, flying past her, and Prin
cess Sea-Foam, filled with delight,- bent
down and kissed the dainty flowerets at
her feet. Near by was a tiny lake, and
the little Princess plunging into it swam
to and fro, laughing merrily.
Then, leaving the water, she opened one
of the oyster shells that Mother o' Pearl
had given her and put on the gown of
billowy sta-foam, embroidered wi;h mom
beams. She looked so exquisitely lovely
that the flowers whispered and the birds
twittered their amazement to one another
while Princess Sea-Foam, holding up her
snowy skirts, began to dance. To and
fro, round and round she spun, her white
feet twinkling like stars among the grass
es. Then, growing tired of dancing, she
seated herself upon the low branch of a
tree, and swaying to and fro sans one
of the wondrous songs taught her by the
Mermaids.
Just then the King of the Country into
whleli she had wandered rode past and
listened to her singing in enraptured
silence. Gazing into the green heart of
the wood he caught sight of the Princess,
and was filled with amazement at her
marvelous beauty.
"Surely she is the Goddess of Spring or
fome lovely Wood Nymph!" , he ' ex
claimed In wonderment. "Never before
have I beheld such a beautiful maiden,"
and entering the wood he drew near the
Princess to speak to her.
The King was young, tall and hand
some, with frank blue eyes and a merry
laugh. He offered to" show Princess Sea-
Foam the path through the wood, and
while she walked beside him she told him
the story of her life.
"He is both kind and charming," she
thought. "I have never before meÂ£ such
a pleasant companion," and soon the two
became great friends.
"1 wish you would let mo show you all
the beauties of the earth," pleaded the
King. "If you will come and live at the
palace 1 will do my utmost to make your
life a happy one." And Princess Sea-
Foam, thanking him, said she would like
to accompany him; so the King, seating
her upon his horse, conducted her to his

Meanwhile Princess Sea- Foam, changed
to a daisy, dwelt alone on a solitary Isl
and in a distant sea. Winter and summer
came and went and spring found her still
waiting with childlike trust for her lover
to come. and release her.

But Princess. Sea-Foam shook. her head
sadly. ."If he "comes : not," she faltered.
"I will die here mourning for him." And
. as the weary . months dragged past and
no help^carae she languished and drooped,
and felt she rau3t' surely dfe.
The petals of the Princess were of shlnÂ«
ins silver, while within her \u25a0heart of jjoli
a crystal dewdrop forever .sparkled. Ono
day a swallow. Journeying' acr:>s3 tHe sea
to sunny clings, stopped . to root awhila
on the island, and seeing: the marvelous
daisy addressed her and inc;uired whenct
/ she had come.
"Ah. little bird." sighed the Princess, a*
. she told him her story, "if only you would
" bear a message to my lover: Tell him 1
-still zza true to him. and nine alone upoa
this dreary islet."
"But there are many "monarchs in thÂ«
world, and I fear I should not be clevej
.enough to tlnd the one you â¢ love." sal J
"the swallow. . - m .
"Then take my message- to others who
love meâ to the white sea-oxen In the gar
den of the enchanter' Lokio," said tha
Princes 3. "Often have . I sported with
them beneath the waves, have fed and
caressed them. They will not fail to help
me in my time of trouble."
"I know the castle of the enchanter,
and will go there at once and do your bid
ding." said the swallow, and spreading
his wings he skimmed away, while tha
Princess trembled with Joy.
Meanwhile the King, despondent and
heartsick, had determined to seek the aid
of the magician, and was making his way
toward the castlo of Loklo. '\u25a0
"Princess Sea-Foam! My lost love I
Where are you?" he moaned aloud. "Can
It be that I have lost you forever r*.
Just then the swallow skimmed past
and overheard him. Perching on the ledga
of a rock he twittered to the- King tidings
of the missing Princess, and gave him
her message. The King's heart bounded
with Joy, and hastening through the gar
dens of the enchanter to the spot whcra
the white oxen were grazing he besought
their aid. -
"If the swallow will show "us the way
we will willingly bear you across tha
water to the islet where the Princess 13
held captive," said tha chief of the sea
beasts.
So the King, seated on the shoulders of *
the snow-white ox, set off across tha
ocean, and ere long landed on tha solitary
islet. ,;;.;,;;
But. the witches seeing him coming
caused daisies to spring up all over tha
island, and he searched for a. long tixna
without finding the Princess.- j
"It I soar over the islet I might perhaps
fled her," said the swallow, and flying ott
he soon espied the wondrous daisy with
the silver petals and golden heart.
Trembling with delight the King bent
over her and kissed her. He could not
refrain, from shedding tears of joy. and
some of them rolling down his eheelia
fell on the face of the daisy. Instantly
the floweret vanished and in her place
stood the Princess more beautiful than
ever.
"Beloved, at last I have found yen:!
The spell is broken!" cried the Kins', em
bracing her. "Let us hasten away from
this desolate spot lest further ill befall us."'
Returning to the shore he . lifted tha
Princess upon the back of the fiUthful
sea-ox, and seating himself l>es!d& he?
they crossed the water in. safety. Then,
reaching the castle of Ix>kio, they hast
ened at once to the Royal Palace.
Great was ,the rejoicing among the
King's subjects when it became known
that he had returned with the Prin
cess. Every one was filled with ile-^
light save Rathild and her spiteful
daughter, who were overcome with,
anger and mortification.

"Even yet it is not too late to pre

follow her advice.
On the day preceding the royal wed

rode through the forest, accompanied
by the nobles and huntsmen. After a
while he and his bride separated them
selves from the others and dismounted
to rest a while beside a tiny lake, when
Rodolf approached them, saying he had
seen a fine buck near by.
He bade his brother wait while ha
drove it toward him, then â¢ retreating a
few paces he hid himself behind a tree,
and, fitting an arrow to hi 3 bow. sent
a winged shaft straight at the heart or
the King. But Princess Sea-Foam, see
ing his action, fiung herself In front oi
her lover and received the arrow in
her breast.
Thinking he had killed bar, Rodoir,
seized with sudden remorse, leaped Into
tha lake and was never again seen.
The arrow, however, had not harmed
the Princess, but striking on the gold
locket suspended from j her neck had
glanced aside.
"You have offered your Ufa for mine.
How can I ever rapay you for your un
selfish devotion?" cried tha Klnff.
"Let uÂ» be married quite quietly, with
out pomp or ceremony, in the litUa gray
church on the cliff," said Princess Sea-
Foam.
; "Our wedding shall take place there to
night. It is the eve of Christmas," re
plied the Kir.*, as they returned to tha
palace."
Meanwhile Rathild. who had heard oi
the frustration of her plans, frenzied with,
anger, set out with her daughter for tha
abode of the witches. Finding them gath
ered together upon the hilltop she began
at once to rail at them and abuse. them,
declaring their magic potions useless, an 4
demanding the return of her Jewels.
Filled with indignation at her ingrati
tude the witches resolved to punish her
without delay. "Waving their magic wands
above the heads of Rathild and Matilda
they transformed them into two black
dogs, who fled, snarling and yelping, down
the . hillside. Being hated and â¢ feared by
all who knew them, they were neither
sought for nor lamented.

KÂ«^ things be found. I say to my
self, where is the place of their
creation?
Manifestly not in cook-books, those
volumes of so great Importance to Mes
dames Newlywed, nor yet in the more
comprehensive pronouncements on gen
eral domestic science, for these tell only
of achievements known of old. Tried and
true, yes. so they are, but wanting the
quality of distinction that alone could
warrant our offering them to you at a
time when you, . like' the Sunday editor,
ere demanding something special.
Of all the holidays this one of Decem

Every wanderer who Js within reach of
home bends all efforts to arrive before
the day and the business travelers, our
regular visitants, forget their routine in
making gled for kith and kin this time
of peace on earth good â¢will to men.
To you, the housewives, the important
part cf the celebration, once Santa Claus'
visit is arranged for and successfully
executed, is the dinner. You have a
proper ambition that it shall surpass not
only the attainments of three hundred
sixty-four day? in the yearâ including the
Thanksgiving triumphâ but to here and
now establish a new standard for all
Christmases yet to be.
It is evident that what you want can
be secured only from the originators of
new dishes; from the ehef.s who minister
to those thousands of San Franciscans
who cat not for the prosaic reason that
they are hungry nor lest they may be
by and by, but becaure eating is a
pleasure when the viands are as the
gods' ambrosia for delicacy of flavor.
Hotels and clubs catering to the wants
of these epicures must prove our mines
of novelties.
To the chefs, then.

A very aristocrat of cooks is this Mr.
Victor Klrtzlcr. Born of an Alsatian fam

generations, he was duly graduated from
the famous Strarburg school of cooking
and for two rears served as one of the
vast retinue of esperts In the culinary de
partment of the St. Petersburg palace of
Nicholas, Czar of all the Russias.
Will he, I wonder, bear himself haught
ily, as befits one who has served royalty?
Will he remind me that to direct the
kitchens cf a great hotel takes all that a
man has of time, and will his crushing
finsJe be that there are books to which I
may refer for suggestions as to what it
were good to serve for our Christmas
feast?
ICot by any means. He is more than
approachable. With eagerness we go over
the menu, already written off for me,
and he exclaims: "Every dish is a real

See this, that I was working on when

. As It Is translated to my eyes I am
glad to recall that the idea of picturing
delicious dishes had not been exploited
when Barmecide gave his so celebrated
spread. The unhappy Shacabac had
enough to bear from mere descriptions of
the Imaginary. Whatever could he have
done if the things had been illustrated?
But we have not to do with Barmecide
feasts. Our Christmas dinner must be
graced by dishes, real, tangible, edible
and digestible. And this is what Chef

Plainly this season will establish anew
the truth that though San Franiisco
plays, through course of time, full many
a part In Its. public capacity of clearing-:
house for the tourists of the world, none
is discharged with greater cordiality than
the part of host at Christmas.
And no man. if he but know his way.
need refrain from asking a share of the
holiday bread In fear lest he jbe given a
foliage. There are also some very pretty
conventional designs. Including: a. leaded
glass effect which Is excellent for libra
ries, ilinlng-rooms and living-rooms. In
a room finished with dark wood a peacock
pattern of scrim would be exceptionally
harmonious. This shows a white ground
absolutely covered with a gorgeous pea
cock feather design, in the natural hues,
set off by a touch of brown.
These curtains require no trimming In
the way of fringe, ruffles, etc., and are
generally draped on either side of the
window In \ enormous rosettes. A very,^
effective livine-room. curtain shows bob- ,
binet of a deep ecru shade appliqued with
arabesques in natural colored linen out
lined by a very fine cotton braid. The
braid used may be green,, brown, red or
dull blue, according to the color of thÂ»
room, and a woman who Is quick with
her needle can make thsse by buying the
bobbinet by the yard and getting tha
linen or batiste, or even a natural colored
lawn, and appliquing It in patterns which
she can copy from conventionalized de
signs, such as fleur-de-lis, crescents,
stars, arabesques or cornucopias. The
cotton braid can be bought by the bolt
very cheaply, and the result \u25a0 will be a
very good Imitation of an expensive
ready-to-hang curtain. The applique can
be done by machine, and will stand the
wear and tear of cleaning better than if
done Â»y hana.
The basket weaves scrim Is almost as
coarse as bobbinet. and In its most ex
pensive and desirable form shows roses
climbing over a barred or trellised pat
tern. The new Nottingham curtains are
remarkable for the larse and striking
patterns, which almost hide the mesh
of the lace. Convolvulus, peonies, enorm
ous roses and chrysanthemums arÂ© em
ployed In these designs,
Broderie Anglais combined with fllet
lace is an extravagance of the moment
for housewives who do not have to count
their pennies too closely. Some clever
imitations In machine work are offered
in this class. The woman who wishes to
mak* her own curtains can get machine
made all-over English eyelet work at
$150 a yard and Inset it with filet lacel
Insertion, also machine-made, which \u25a0 \?f
rot more expensive than the torchon or
antique. These very faddish . curtains-,
however, are not a standard style and
.the bbbbinets. set off by guipure. Cluny
, and Arabian and â¢ antique lace, are still
â¢ in favor among conservative furnishers. :

AUGUSTA PRESCOTT
NEW YORK, Dec. 9.
f< yr yn *\ HAT do you want for
\ A / Christmas?" asked a hus-
V W band of his wife.
*\u25a0 *" -Til take a negligee."
said she.
Tiie result was a trip to a department
More and the purchase of the prettiest
:::ir.g In crepe de chir.e that could be
bought. It was in turquoise blue, piped
with, cherry and trimmed with torchon
and Renaissance, the two laces being
combined in a striking manner by ap
plying one on top of the other.
Queen Alexandra has placed an order
with a French costumer for a negligee.
She has given i\lm carte blanche to
produce tne finest tea gown ever built
.-Â«: a. -Â«:a a. Paris dressmaking establishment.
jj The details have not yet leaked out,
\ \it the materi&l is to be a pink velvet,
. Â«sry th;n and very soft,- and its only
i rimming will be a great deal of En
glish *yelet embroidery, which will
adorn the foot of the skirt, going all
around the train, while up the front
ihere will be a double panel.
The yoke, shoulderettes and front
will be one mass of the English eyelet
work, and thus the Queen of England
will be dressed in a negligee the like
of which has never before been pro
duced, for it is on lines original and
::i colors new.
The English eyelet embroidery of the
season is done in several tints. The
eyelets, as you know, are punched, so
to tpeak, into the material, and are
then worked precisely as one worked
the flannel petticoats of forty years
hgo. Indeed, one employs the old-fash
ioned embroiderers to do the work.
TherÂ« are some small decorations
Fuch as swirls of embroidery and cir
cles and semicircles of silk that are
new. But the great mass of t,he work
is eyelet work and life holes are done
in silks of various colors, thus making
a beautiful trimming of fine embroid
ery.- It is done upon cloth, silk and
velvet.
Queen Alexandra.-; daughter .Victoria
Ss to have a peignoir, which, for origi
nal lines, can be highly recommended,
for It is to l>e made of ice green taffeta
.primmed with Renaissance lace. The-
WiMlrt and the blouse are of the taffeta,
Â»Hth narrow ruffles of the lace, and
over this there is a coat made entirely
of piece lace with a ruffle of lace ex
tending all around it. A dash of color
is given the costume by a large bow
of ice green chiffon velvet, lined with
deep red, while the girdle is of ice
green velvet piped with red. The neck
is cut low and the sleeves are short.
This is a thing that could be made at
\u25a0 borne by any women who can new.
The Lively lons XesHgree Lines.
"What are w<; going to do with our
neck and arms?" wrote a woman to a
modiste who was making a tea gown
for her. "I notice that all the new
gowns are cut rounded in the neck,
iront and back, and that the sleeves
are elbow sleeves. This calls for
thort-sleeved and low-necked flannels
and it is a positive invitation to pneu
monia and la grippe."
The modiste replied: "iladamc, we do
not pretend to prescribe for the health
of our customers. It is all we can do
to make the gown. Fashion calls for
the low-necked house gown and the
nhort-slceved: gown and there is noth
ing we can do except to obey the dic
tates laid down to us."
The new negligees are positively
beautiful In their lines. One scarcely
sees the- old fashions at all and one
v.-ould have to look a long time for the
styles which were in vogue a very few
years ago. Those who remember the
Mother Hubbard and who recall with
enry its loose, free lines will have to
l*mk a long time for anything which
rersinibles It, for there is nothing: at all
that Is built on the ;trictly loose order.
Everything Is empire or Is gird>d,
Fhlrred, belted or \u25a0fitted to the figure.
This makes the simple tea gown a
ereat deal of work, 'for rt now needs
fitting as though it were a dinner dress.
A princess dress is one of the hand
somest things seen lately. Its founda
tion Is a" cream colored crepe de chine,
most gorgeously soft and clinging, "and
so dressy that* it might answer for a
dinner gown. It Is made on the,em
pire style, with a. very short back and
a very short front, while the hips. are
slightly fitted. The back is trimmed
with bands of Renaissance lace laid
flat across me back, while extending
from the shoulders right down to the
bottom of the train there are wide
bands of the same lace. ; ;. i
There is a touch of color seen In the
rosettes which trim this ; and, \ other
gowns, and these rosettes,; by the way,.'
ore made of apricot silk ' showing, ;a
faint touch of pinkâ a color" \u25a0-.always*
good Â«wUh everything.^ In the middle,
of each rosette there is a little knot of
red ribbon, giving 'the r whole the: ap
pearance as of a rose. "; Shaded roses
and shaded rosettes are immensely
pretty and very effective -upon house
gowns, too. .(
The. woman , who is : going: to -wear
pretty gowns this season should inter
est herself right away In the .girdle
proposition. Tho girdle \ can ..be : made
so that It looks well, upon the negligee
or thegown, or so It- can be worn with
the dinner dress or the ' street costume.

for any occasion. . ..

Making Your Lace Look Like Real.
v*;Ttiere Is : always something new to be
told v about? lace, and ; a French modiste
the % other .Jday4 quite*, voiced 'the senti
ment of the season when she said: "We'
are I trimming; almost : exclusively with
lace, <= and '} from '? experience we '.''-\u25a0 have
! learned -; howi. to" use ;â¢ our < lace '\u25a0': so that
f it : shows ; tq' best advantage. - ;
v^ "There ; was" altime,'*/ said she. -"when
cheap' lace â¢ looked ' like cheap lace, but
this year It is quits different. All laces
look like the real, and it Is only very
extravagant . women who are willing:
to invest money for tho high-priced Im
ported varieties. They much prefer to
buy tho Imitation and trust to skill to
conceal the fact that It is not the true
article.
"There are tricks In all trades, and
particularly in that of tho dressmaking:
trade. This yeax modistes art- studying
lacea with a vtÂ»w to making them
look twice ' as expensive as they real
ly are. To say thac we succeed Is not
claiming too much for pur skill. A few
instance ; of this will serve to convince
the most skeptical that I know what I
am talking about. I have transformed
laces in tho most wonderful' manner.
, "It was only yesterday that one of
my best customers, came to me with a
strip of lace about eight inches in width
and perhaps six yards' long". '1 am anx
ious,' said she, to have a lace Counce
which shall look precisely like the real.
-1 bought this lace lor 6u cants a yard,
and nowl would like to havo it trans
formed Into a lace V7hleh shall look
like * something "costinc a great deal
more.'
"I 'took the lace In my hands and ex
amined it. It was Â«. very cheap imita
tion Valenciennes, and oa inspecting it
closely I came to the conclusion that its
only merit was that it was. very thin,
for, if it had been a coarse Italian
Valenciennes, I could have done noth
ing whatever with it.
" 'Leave the lace with me, madam,' I
said, "and I will see what I can do.'
"When, she had gone I took dome old
chiffon which I happened to have on
hand, and. 'working on it very cautiously,
I lined, the lace with the chif
fon... Then I made a ruffle of cream
colored taffeta and over this I placed
th# lined lace. Finally I shirred the
whole In such a manner that the lace
made a little heading along the top
of the flounce, and. so, I set the ruffle on
the skirt." i;arranged it rather scantily
in front andfullin the back, and when
I had finished you would , have declared
that the gown was trimmed with a
hundred dollar lace flounce, so good
was 'the deception. % ;-: /
"The dress, which, by the way, was
a negligee, could be worn until dinner

MAKING OF PERFUMES
OFTTIMESthe question Is asked:
"Why are perfumes so expensive?
Not .long ago a well dressed
woman went : Into a drug store
and ; asked for Persian orchid/ a
scent the delightful fragrance of which
she had recently discovered. The per
fume was produced, and she .was some
what astonished to find that her cash
ier's check for an. ounce bottle of it
read:"sB.' ; , For a moment she was in
clined to think the clerk had made a
mistake and when she asked for an ex
planation of the cost she learned some
thing, about the manufacture of per
fumes, which she' had never known be
fore To begin with, the Persian orchid
is an exceedingly rare 'flower and when
grown in the. Eastern ; greenhouses
readily, brings a price of $40 : a dozen.
It ;ls A not ; from these ; blossoms that \u25a0 the
perfume ; is made, however.' The gather
ing of orchid flowers -In" their" native
haunts isV attended with considerable
danger, and .expense and it â¢ requires an
astonishing -number, of. blooms, to pro
duce ; a.very. little 'bit >f the essence
from -which the tcommerclal product is
made, 'yiolet,'^ rose and' other.- more,
common rr * varieties iof perfume are. by no
means , cheap." because of the^ fact that
so. many: flowers are '\u25a0; used in preparing
the essential oil or the essence in solid
form. â¢ \u25a0 \u25a0
; ;The 1 "\u25a0 process* by^whlcjtrthol^tal^. a^e
edge I set a ruffle of cheap lace. A fichu
draped the neck and was caught at the
front with a big bow of prune colored
velvet. You would have sworn that
It was an embroidered peignoir, cost-
ing not less than $500. Indeed, I have
Imported many a on* which coat a
great deal more."
The experience of this modiste is
quite a common one, for all dressmak
ers will tell you that they are using all
their skill tula year to so handle lace
which is give** to them that it will look
like a very expensive variety. You can
actually deceive your best friend in
this respect.
Lace is made elegantly deceptive In
one of several ways, the most common
of which is that of lining the lace. It
is lined with chiffon, with organdie.
mull, tulle, eery thin taffeta or crepa
<!e chine. Another device Is to tint the
lace and a third and much more ele
gant one Is that of embroidering the
lace by hand. Any apprentice nearly
can do It. - -
To embroider cheap lace, take a
slcein of deep red silk and run around
the figures quickly and loosely, using
a running stitch. Now follow this first
chain of silk with another one, this
time using a tint as nearly like gold
as you can obtain. Next let your silk
be cream colored, and finally usa a very
dull brown. This wi!l give you quits
an Oriental effect, and one which you
will like very much.
Something About tbe Â»w Sleeve*.
Tho nightingale sleeve is worn *
great deal upon the tea gown, for It Is
comfortable and pretty, and It can bÂ«
made at home, which Is a great thins
in its favor. If you have an old sleeva
rather large and flaring at the hand,
you can slit It right up to the shoulder,
letting it fall wide open. Nolw you will
v/ant to make a series of big eyelet
hole 3, through which you can run rib
bons, so that they will tie in little bows
on top of the arms, or if you do not
feel equal to the task of making the
eyelet holes you can take rings nicely
embroidered and sew them to the
sleeve, after which you can run ribbons
through these rings.
For the opera these aleeves must bÂ«
lined with silk and trimmed with fur.
One lovely pair of sleeves had silk puffs
pulled out between the ribbons, but for
the house they are open, so as to show
the shirtwaist underneath, or. what is
prettier .'stiil. the bare arm. And thus
the peignoir Is complete.
There is a negligee sleeve which Is
two yard 3 wide and made of Oriental
silk. It is a great success, for It Is
becoming to all arms, both thin and fat.
robbed of their sweetness are three.
Two of these produce the essential oil
and tho third produces the solid. In tha
firit, a broad sheet of plate glass Is
used. This Is spread thickly with pura
grease and covered with freshly gath
ered petals. As they wilt in the sun.
they are replaced by others until the
grease has absorbed all the fragrance
it will hold. This grease will hold the
scent almost indefinitely, and when aa
much as possible has been removed
from. it. It is still so fragrant that It
brings a high price. It is used In the
manufacture of the most expensive
scented toilet soaps. According to the
second process thÂ« petals are infused
In oil, 'a long, and tedious procedure.
The third method employs ether, in
which the petals are infused until all
their fragrance â has left them. This
ether is then distilled and the solid pro
duct which .is left Is worth consider
ably more than Its* weight in gold. It
commonly sells" for about $200 an ounce,
and it is worth all it costs, for It Is by
far the best of. three processes.
- Cheap perfumes are not derived from
the living flowers, but are compounded
of chemicals which are supposed to be
identical with the chemicals found In
the'flowers. The formula for any given
perfume is found by analyzing the solid
_product- of the other process. Yet the
Vesulting perfume Is not the sam*. Just
where .'the .difference lies no one can
determine. Nature has a way of guard
lag her secrets.CHRISTMAS GAMES FOR CHILDREN

The good old fashion of cracking, nuts
before a roaring fire, watching It slowly
fade and die, and then every one from A
to Z hanging v:Â» their stockings Is a
thins of the past. It's by far too tame
for the youngsters of to-day , and they
would consider such a Christmas UUle
short of a calamity.
They don't know what fun it is to hang
on the ragged edge of the bed listening
to every round and to slip out and tip-"
toe into the living room, thinking *nd
hoping to catch jolly o)d Nick In the
middle of his visit. They don't >now
what it is to fairly pinch themselves to
keep awake in order to hear the tiny
patters of the ralndeer as they glide over
the roof to the chimney or to get' up
before it Is light to talce a first peep and
to make such a noire that the house,
family and all fairly comes down about

No, such simuJe pleasures belong to an
other day and in place have coaie dances,
dinners and parties and a hundred and

whirl of excitement and that sends them
home groaning with burdens that they
know full weil come from other than
the jolly old man who makes merry the
holiday season. - '\u25a0..'â¢â¢
Of course, Christmas trees' are stin
used to delight the heart of little, folks,
but they must be wee people, for nearly
all the pretty traditions and stories have
long :-:inco been exploded and it Is only
the baby who claps her little hands and
cries with jjlee when the doors are
thrown onen and the tree is seen In all
its twinkling splendor.
It is such a pretty notion and means
Eiicb a deal of fun trimming . and ar
ranging it that many are loth to really
give It up, so a new frill has been added
that gives it a touch of the. novel and
brings it well v? to time.
Dancing round the Maypole has al
ways afforded any amount of pleasure,
both to the dancers and the. spectators,
and it suddenly dawned upon a clever
woman that it ought to work quite as
well In winter as in summer and she
forthwith borrowed the streamers and
rigged up her tree Maypole fashion".
Of course, she didn't borrow much more
than the suggestion, for pale pinks, blues
and whites that blend with apple and
peach blossoms look sadly out of place
In a bower of glowing berries arid"shin
ing mistletoe. On top of the tree' she
placed a merry little clown, who nearly
broke his back bowing and scraping . to
the ' throng from his lofty-, position.
One hand held the red and green satin
streamers and jingled the tiny folly bells
that bordered both edges. The rest of the
tree was quite the same as any other.
When the children came tumbling ln T
to the room she lined them up and told
them that when she rang a bell they
were to scramble for; the streamers,
which were all of different lengths, and
that they were to dance in a- winding
fashion about the tree until the music
ceased. At that signal they' were to
drop their streamer and catch another
end be ready to dance in the opposite
direction. Owing to the long and short
ends and the scramble every two or
three minutes some one would.be bound
to work nearer and nearer' the tree un
til the streamer would be too high 'to
hold conveniently, and . this was the
lucky one to win the prize that hungin
plain sight but just out of reach of all.
You sec her idea wasn't so awfully
new, but It was new enough t& cause
t-peculation.^and that In itself jla "some
thing these days. â¢ -." .
Musical .games scera ., stronger this
year than they have ever been before,
and when they are played; with a prize
in view it lends a zest that is impossi
ble to gain otherwise. For instance;,
take the game of musical chairs. .If
ten are to play nine chairs- are .placed
in a row. alternately facing:; in and, out.
When the music begins aM Snarch", sOl-,
c-mnly about, keeping a vigilant efe- on
the player and the nearest chair, '.' toy
woibttide the unfortunate' who isn't
paying strict attention when the march
suddenly ceases. It's one errand' scram
ble and a hurried flop, and, of course,
one person finds himie.f out in the cold.
Each lime the music stops the chair is
removed, so that there Is always one
more In the game than there are chairs.
Naturally the one to. hold the 'final chair
is declared the winner.
All children love to act and nothing
pleasts them more than charades or
tableaux. Especially those that', de
mand costumes, fov they thoroughly
enjoy peacocking about and* ira iking
small exhibitions off themaelved. And li.
really isn't so very much trouble or* ex
pense either. Nearly every one, lias a.
bay or swell window and a smallTpldt'
form roughly put together and covered
with a convenient rug does beautifully
lor a stage. The curtain may be a
Japanese screen, and if" the" house
doesn't possess such an article, the
clothes rack borrowed from the ?Jauri

quite as well. In- fact, sometime* far
better, for it fs nearly always" larger
in every way ar.d gives the miniature
actors more space to fuss and feather
in./ \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0â¢'}.- . \u25a0/. \u25a0 :
Another rattling good amusement is
the shadow pantomime, and if the stage
manager understands his business the
whole tfcing is simplicity itself. Stretch
a' large sheet across the folding doors
and make: the two just meet so ' the
linen will be firm and tight. Nexi
sponge it lightly and evenly with water,
for it is exasperating if the shadows
nre anything but distinct and ' strong.
One fandle, about a foot from the floor,
is plenty of light, and, of course, the
audience room should be dark. A bell
rings, the doors are parted, the reader
begins' and the performance is on.
Anything that requires rehearsals is
always more fun than a barrel of mon
3:eys, v for each meeting brings forth its
own/pleasures and often times im-
promptu affairs have a snap and a go
that are entirely missing at something
carefully planned.
Uttle people - always appreciate the
unexpected and the mysterious and for
this' reason' the j Christmas grab-bag
rieVer fails to contribute Its full portion
of 'sport. Generally the # "bag;" is a box,
nio.re.ly for the sake of convenience,
and it ought to be brimming full of
queerly shaped parcels done, 'up in all
\u25a0manner of fantastic shapes and colors.
Every one is given a peep and allowed
lo figure out where some particularly
desirous parcel is located and then the
blindfold is securely fastened and the
victim $3 turned , around a couple of
times and started on the way rejoicing:.
Once there no peeping and no fingering
is permitted and nine times out of ten
the very bundle marked to be carefully
avoided. Is the one that seems lo slip
into the way and is lifted happily from
its resting place.
Anything that carries out the com
petitive idea and promises a reward is,
always jolly and these days when all
the youngsters In the land can give
their fathers and mothers cards and
spades. In dancing It is a shame not to
give them* an opportunity to show what
they. really can do in that line. Cos
tume dancing is - always fetching, but
as' if entails more or less expense, is
not as 'popular as the ordinary steps
that call' for a billow of fluffy lace and
a few showy ribbons.

RICH GIRL AN ISLAND QUEEN
RO7AL HONORS PAID 70 ENGLISH HEIRESS
Lady Mary Douglas Hamilton Reigns on Arran
Special Dl*Tmtch to The Gail.
LONDON. Dec. 16. â On her wild and
picturesque island kingdom of Arran.
*n the Firth of Clyde, Lady Mary Doug
las-Hamilton, the richest heiress in
the United Kingdom, has Just cele
brated her coming of age. Arran,
â¢n-hlch is sixty miles in circumberence
fttid contains 8000 inhabitants, all of
whom are her tenants, yields her In
rÂ»^nts $95,000 a year. She has another
large estate in Suffolk, England, which
brings her in $40,000 a year. The two
properties cover 107.000 acres and their
combined rent rolls amount to $135,000
annually. From investments held In
trust for her she receives another
J 40.000 a year, which makes her an
nual income $175,000.
Nor is that the full measure of her
wealth. Her father, the twelfth Duke
Jt? Hamilton, who died ten years ago.
â¢ >ft her a big fortune In cash, which,
during the nine years of her minority,
has swelled to $1,000,000. The good
fairies who presided at her. birth added
other precJous gifts. She Is good-look
ing, blessed with vigorous health and
endowed with the temperament which
l^nds Itself most to the enjoyment of
life in the fullest measure.
Tet bounteous as Is her inheritance,
the fates dealt somewhat harshly with
her wnen they decreed that she should
lie. a girl. Had she been a boy, shÂ«
would now represent two dukes. twÂ»
< Hrls, three marquises and eight bar
ons, all merged into one exalted indi
vidual; Premier Peer of Scotland and
Hereditary Keeper of the Palace of i
Ijolyrood. and her 107.000 acres would
have stretched to 150.000.
She was the only child of her
j.arent6 and they had been married
eleven years before she was born.
Grievous was their disappointment
when they found that, instead of the
long-hoped-for Mn and heir, the stork
had brought them a girl. Her father
:md mother loved her none the less for
that, though, and there was another
man who felt deeply and profoundly
grateful to her for it, the man who has
Kalned what she lost through the laws
of succession because she was a girl.
At the time of her birth he was plain
Lieutenant Alfred Douglas Hamilton
(without the aristocratic hyphen) of
the British navy. When he was born
It seemed that he hardly stood a chance
of, becoming the Duke of Hamilton. His
r.^r^Bt ducal ancestor lived in the time
ofVjromwell. He was only a fourth
cousin of the reigning, duke, and be
tween him and the latter's long string
cf titles several lives intervened. But
Death, the reaper, gathered them all
in gradually, and soon after Lady Mary
The San Francisco Call.
was born the plain lieutenant was heir
presumptive to the proudest peerage in
Scotland.-
FORTUXE DEEDED TO HER.
The Duke did not take at all kindly
to the idea of being succeeded by his
distant kinsman. He could not alien
ate the titles, but he found a grim sat
isfaction in alienating as much of the
land from him as the laws of entail
permitted and settling it on Lady Mary.
Art treasures, heirlooms, the famous
Hamilton black pearls, worth anywhere
between $150,000 and $200,000, and all
else that the law did not compel him to
leave for the lieutenant he bequeathed
to his daughter. And thus it has come
to pass that she is now the richest
heiress in Great Britain, while the
many-titled Duke has only 43,000 acres
of land, and in Hamilton Palace, the
ducal home, are many bare rooms
which were once sumptuously fur
nished.
. The absence of the Duke and his
wife from the festivities which com
memorated Lady Mary's coming of age
furnished significant proof that the par
tition' of the inheritance has left be
hind it a legacy of ill feeling oh both
sides.
But that, did not mar their brilliancy.
Not long, since the neighboring island
of Bute celebrated the majority of its
young Marquis and Arran folk were
determined to give their lady para
mount a still finer show.
There were two balls and they were
both Immense successes. The decora
tions were appropriate: the colors of
the Douglas, the cognizance and arms
of Hamilton, Angus, Selkirk and divers
other great houses whose blood runs. in
Lady Mary's veins were on every side;
huge antlered stags' heads, with .their
forest of points, the biggest of all shot
by the late Duke, a beast almost a mir
acle for size and beauty, were flanked
by many which had fallen to the rifles
of the dowager duchess and Lady Mary
herself.
If the decorations were unique the
company was no less so. There were
keepers in velveteen, flsherfolk from
Lamlash and Ranza; hillmen from Glen
Sannox and Glen Rosa; and lassies
whose manners were as pretty as their
fresh, sweet faces, but who evidently
had never been so near the "quality"
before In all their island live*.
FOXD OF OUTDOOR LIFE.
The guests included representatives
of the families most famed in Scotch
history. Most active among the dancers
was the young Marquis of Graham, heir
to the Duke of Montrose and a baker's
dozen of other titles and 115.000 broad
acres. Very kindly, if Inquisitive, eyes

watched every word that passed be

and the island queen. It is early yet
and Lady Mary can? aim high, but
friendly gossip has already linked their
names together, and undoubtedly the
match, would be immensely . popular In

in London. ...
Complimented for Work
by Head of the

Two American Peeresses in a
Social War in British
Metropolis.
Special Cable to The Call.
LONDON, Dec. 16. â To the many
haughty titles which Consuelo Van
derbilt acquired by her marriage to, the
Duke of Alariborough has just been
added a new one. it Is one of which
she should feel prouder than of all her
other dignitaries combined, for she has
actually earned It. * The Rev. Wilson
Carlne, head of tiie Church Army, in
tne course of a public speech, the other
day, said that the American Duchess
was 'the 'best commercial traveler in
London lor the Church Army."
The Church Army Is modeled on lines
similar to those of the Salvation Army,
and has done more than any other or
ganization to relieve the established
church ot tne reproach that ; it neg
lects Lazafus in order to pander to
Dives. Last winter Mr. , Carhle got
tne Duchess of Marlborough to pre
side over one of his charity bazaars. A
titled dame of high degree always helps
draw the crowd, and the crowd brings
money.
The Duchess ,was not content with
merely playing the role of an aristo
cratic magnet. â¢ In her; motor car, ; ac
companied by. Mr. Carlile; . she made . a
tour of the: various- stations of the
Church Army and saw how its work

of a bed- or a- meal,, should always 'be
paidfor by work income form. f : There
was no pauperizing about Jt.v .: \
PKOVKS (iOODSALESWOMAJf.;- -
The Duchess expressed her. approval
of what she saw by presenting ;: Mr.
Carllle with a checK for 'an amount
that far exceeded his most sanguine
expectations: But she ..did not stop
there. She placed a motor car at the
disposal of all her, friends and ac
quaintances whom she could induce
to visit the various centers of Church
Army activity in the metropolis. She
constituted herself an . agent for the
sale of the chief commercial products of
the Church Array's derelicts â kindling
wood.
She besought orders for it wherever
she went. It soon became understood
that the flrst essential thing to get into
the good graces- of her Grace was to
order a liberal supply of nrewood from
the Church Army. It was not long be
fore the Duchess was selling more
kindling wood for the Church Army
than anybody else in the country. as
a token of gratitude she has been pre
sented with a desk made by out-of
work cabinetmakers who had found
temporary shelter in one of the Church
Army's homes.
There is an interesting contest now
going on between two American peer
esses as to which of them shall ad
vance her husband furthest in- Lon
don's municipal life and incidentally ac
quire thereby the largest measure of
reflected glory. Lady Cheyleamore has
just had the satisfaction of seeing her
husband elected Lord Mayor of West
minster for a second term, which makes
her a Lord Mayoress for, another year.
About twelve months ago Lady Es
sex induced her husband to run for
the London County Council, and he was
elected as a member, for the borough
of Marylebone. Municipally a > County
Councilor counts for rather. more than
a Mayor of any of Us subservient: dis
tricts but it is a position which con
fers no distinction on his wife. There
fore, Lady Essex wants to see her hus
band a Lord Mayor, too. , . ,
Within the lest few weeks he. has
gone to work to make himself "solid,"
as Americans phrase it, with the
Marylebone constituency with* a view
to capturing the. Mayoralty there at
the next election. Among other things
he is displaying keen -interest in; the
Marylebone schools., and has promised
to provide halls where the children can
indulge in gymnastics and other; kinds
of physical exercise. Marylebone will
accept his gifts' with a more or less
show of gratitude, but there is small
likelihood that the Maryleboners i will
ever elect him Mayor. ' ':
In most of - the London . boroughs
democratic Ideas are in the ascend
ency and it is a' fact - that a - plebeian
stands a better chance of receiving the
highest civic â¢ dignity that their, elec
tors can bestow -than an Earl.
Battersea ha* just \u25a0 elected a working
tailor as its Mayor. A significant;;in
dication of the new order of things is
furnished by the new - Mayor of Isling
ton, who has just announced that here
after he will dispense with that ancient
symbol of authority, the mace, and the
services of;that most Imposing and use
less of officials, the mace bearer. Eng
lish civic life is becoming more
and more a mere matterof. business; in
which titles go for nothing and abil
ity alone counts., y

PEOPLE OF SPAIN EAGER
TO HAVE ALFONSO WED
The people of Spain are very anxious to see King Alfonso married, as they believe he will then
give up the dare-devil trick* of which he is so fond and which have repeatedly endangered his
life. The young ruler keeps his subjects in constant alarm by his reckless itiotoring*

MADRID, Dec. 16. â Just, before
Spain's impulsive boy, King left Ma
drid on his recent tour in quest of a
bride, he made one or two notable ad
ditions to the rather extraordinary col
i lection of souvenirs which he has* spent
l the greater part of the past year in
! assembling in one of his apartments in
the royal palace. The existence of this
unique collection has been mentioned
before, but up to now. no catalogue of
its various Items, has ever been fur
nished., They consist entirely. of non
descript mementoes of the frequentoc
casions on which Alfonso XIII has seen
lit to endanger his royal existence, and
it is now . the supreme desire of the
Spanish people to keep the assemblage
of these relics from getting much
larger. k - . -; ; r
\u25a0'*; In spite of' his amazing, pranks, his
subjects are genuinely fond .of their
boy King. But, setting affection aside,
it would be uncommonly inconvenient if
"Don Alfonso," as the 19-year-old sov
ereign is generally called, should hap
pen to come to grief in one of.-. his
periodical attempts to startle the mem
; bers of. nis; suite.. Such a - calamity
would necessitate another period ;of re
gency, which the Spaniards particularly
f dread, and a lengthy one,, the present
heir apparent to the throne.; the little
! Prince of the .- Asturias, being only
i 3 years old. \u0084 .
That is why the people of Spain are
so .anxious to" see the King happily
married, j They think that, as a bene
dict and, 'subsequently,- a father, he
1 will be Inclined to take a graver view
of his responsibilities and thus â¢ avoid
risking his life any oftener than nec
essary.
It would be a mistake, however,- to
set . King, Alfonso down for what- the
Spaniards call a "mala cabeza," or r "gid
\u25a0 dy-braln." On the contrary, he is intel
ligent, cultured and . good-hearted. But
he is really more like a boy of 16. than
one of. nearly 20. and this is undoubt
edly due to the extraordinary, amount
of liberty' he' has always enjoyed,-, the
"early fears : for Lhls health having, led
those /responsible for-,* the King, to
think considerably . more of his phy
sical than of his Intellectual develop
ment/ ' Vi'.^-T â¢' \u25a0
Recently while 1 at San Sebastian,
â¢King Alfonso sallied forth, on foot,
from his 'Villa Mlramar, in; order; to
open -an .exhibition \of paintings and
sculptures. -Crossing, with his - retinue
the | principal .' street iof '.the â¢ town, ; he
happened to pass' by; a coffee houss be
fore which Â» there', was* piled a \ number
of' chairs and tables/composed of metal.
Pages 37 to 46
It.' suddenly occurred ' to " the King to
leap over this heap of furniture, which
was pretty high, eight or ten of the
pieces being placed one upon the other.
Alfonso XIII made a running jump
and passed over \u25a0 the whole lot, ex
cepting the topmost table, .which for
tunately fell to the ground, otherwise
his Majesty might have broken his neck
or a leg. Probably moved by a feeling
ofgratltude toward this table the King
bought it and had it sent home to en
rich his collection of souvenirs.
It is almost' superfluous to speak of
King Alfonso's hair-raising excursions
in his automobile, so much having al
ready been -told about them, but it may
be \u25a0 remarked , that in continuing his
furious "runs" the King has disregard
ed the suplications of both his mother
and the members, of- his Government.
Proceeding \u25a0 from San Sebastian to
Bilbao, in his automobile/ Alfonso XIII
traveled at, a speed of nearly sixty
miles an hour. The - automobile In
which the Minister . of Public Instruc
tion, Senor Mellado, followed, had nec
essarily .to go at the same velocity in
order to keep. up with his Majesty. At
a certain turning â¢in tfte road, both
automobiles ran off the highway and
fell into a ditch, where, striking
against some trees, they were shat
tered. â¢ : ' -
The Minister came off with a broken
head and . his secretary was hurt in
the' legs, while the King had his right
wrist dislocated. .On that occasion the
young King', collection . of souvenirs
was augmented by a small strap which
the sovereign; had. to wear on his In

satisfied with the perils of automobll
ing. He seeks for others wherever ho
can meet with them. During last sum
mer King Alfonso invited to dine with
him at the Royal Villa of La Granja
(near ! Segovia) about fifty or sixty
aristocratic automoblllsts, friends of
hla. After dinner the King showed
his guests the magnificent gardens of
the villa, and after walking with them
through the splendid ' poplar avenues,
full of statues and aristic fountains, he
had the fancy of climbing' up a high
monument.
'He reached the top safely and stood
among the sculptured figures, but when
ne wanted to descend he found it a dif
ficult matter, so that some of his
guests had to come to his relief and
haul him down like a parcel of goods,
so as to prevent him from Injuring his
august limbs, or from adding his own
figure for an indefinite period to the
marble group. When Alfonso was low
ered from bis elevated position, he tors
his trousers, and those identical gar
ments now j form a part of his collec
tion of souvenirs.
Another day. Alfonso, who has a pas
sion for agricultural labors and has re
peatedly declared that he desires to bo
"the first agriculturist of Spain." went
to the Royal Park of the Parda in or
der -to try for himself a new reaping:
machine which had been sent to him
from a firm In Barcelonia. When ha
found himself on the top of the ma
chine he became so enthusiastic with
the excellent results obtained by his
agricultural experiments that, not un
derstanding the mechanism of the ap
paratus, he allowed one of his feet to
be caught by a wheel. If the per
sons present had not instantaneously
managed to stop the movement of the
machinery, his Majesty would have had
his foot completely crushed.
More recently. King Alfonso, who Is
a first-class shot and very fond of
hunting, was Invited by the ex-Conser
vatlve Minister, Marquis de Vadillo. to
shoot quail on an estate of , his called
"Vega de CJdones," In the province of
Sorla. The King accepted the Invita
tion, and a little while after the hunt
ing had commenced saw some quail
rise. Forgetting to assure himself
that nobody was standing within range*
of his rifle, he fired. The charge grazed
the head of a servant of the Marquis of
Vadillo. The servant had been half
hidden among some plants. From that
shooting party Alfonso XIII brought
home, as a remembrance destined for
his collection, the branch of a tree In
which his charge eventually had lodged.

The parlors of the Native Daughters
of the Golden West are at this time
making arrangement for the proper
observance of "mothers' day," which
Is to be one of the fixed days to be
celebrated by the order. The idea was
suggested by Harriet S. Lee of Wood
land and was adopted by the Grand
Parlor. The Idea is, according to Miss
Lee, that the members of the parlors
should on the day fixed have a pro
gramme of entertainment for their
mothers and mothers-in-law, with the
purpose in view of having a sort of
family reunion at which the. guests
can be made to feel that ifi social func
tions of the order they are not forgot

On the occasion of the recent official
visit of Grand President Stirling to San
Jose Parlor there was evidence of ex
cellent, work, harmony and good will.
During the latter part of November
Grand President Stirling instituted
Richmond Parlor at Point Richmond
with thirty-one charter members. It
was organized by Grand Secretary
Laura J. Frakes and the grand presi
dent, assisted by H. L. Sharr and
Charles Ryan of Richmond Parlor of
the Native Sons. The Institution was
by the grand officers â Ariana W. Stir
ling, president; Laura J. Frakes, secre
tary; Eliza D. Keith, past grand presi
dent; Sarah G. Sanborn, grand trustee,
end Agnes M. Troy as grand organist.
The following named district deputies
aided in the work: Lillian Riddell,
Leah Wrede. May Barry, Jennie Jor
dan. After the installation, which was
carried on In public, there was a ban
quet, tendered by the members of the
Native Sons' Parlor to the ladies ar.d
visiting grand officers. There were re
sponses by all of the grand officers
named. Messrs. Ryan and Scharr and
Mrs. Spiersch, president of the new
parlor.
Minstrel shows by the Native Daugh
ters are profitable. The one recently
given by El Camlno Parlor at Palo
.Mto netted J6O to the parlor's fund md
that given by Greenwood Parlor, J33|
to the fund for the purchase of official
banner*.
Nearly all of th<* parlors held
Thanksgiving day exercises. A fea
ture of the one in Orinda Parlor was
the giving of prizes to the two mem
bers who should present the best es
pays on the day in fifty words or less.
The winners were Hannah Nolan and
Anna Gruber. La. Bandera Parlor of
Facramento had a short programme
snd games; Ruby Parlor had a grand

The merr.bers of Joaquin Parlor of
Stockton, believing that as children of a
favored State they should observa
Thankspivinjr day. did so on the night of
its last held meeting in November. In ob
servance of the day there was a pro
gramme made up of the following num
bers: "My Native Land." sung by the
parlor: a reading, "Thanksgiving Day,"
Mr.=. Emma Barney; piano recital, Miss
Minnie Hilke; comic recitation. "The
Servant Girl," Mrs. Lillian Parker;
giving address to the parlor, by the pres
ident. Mrs. Anna Boehne, and tbe dox
clogy. AJ the conclusion of the pro
gramme there was an adjournment to the
artistically decorated dining hall, red and
preen and holly berries predominating,
where all partook of a most excellent
Slipper. In her address to the parlor the
president in most eloquent language re
viewed the past year of the life of the
organization, and said that the members
had reason to be thankful for many
thingsâ first, death had been a stranger,
the membership and finances had in
creased and all had "worked in harmony"
for the advancement and expansion of
the order. "It is true," she continued,
"that there have been little differences
of orinion. such as are. likely to arise in
any organization, even among those com
posed exclusively of men, but all such
have bc^n reconciled and good has re
sulted, for if it were not for differences
of opinion at times the best ideas would
rot come to the surface, and in every ln
etance the minority has cheerfully abided
by the will of the majority. For all these
blessings in the immediate circle of our
parlor we should feel very grateful." She
taid that the members of the parlor had
reason to be thankful that our great and
glorious country is at peace with the rest
"of the world, and for the peace between
two warrinj nations brought about in
the name of humanity through the ef
forts of the President of the country, also
fcr the prosperity of the country. In con
cluding she tendered "heartfelt thanks to
you, my sisters, for your sisterly kind
ness and courtesy to me and for your
helpfulness and sympathy since I have
been your presiding officer."

second week in December, and La Es
trella Parlcr had one at the same place
last week.
The observance of the thanksgiving day
of the order by Calaveras Parlor, the
beauty parlor of the order, was one of
those events that will be a shining mark
in the history of that organization. The
programme included the reading of an'ac
count of the first Thanksgiving day in
California by President Lucle M. Reincke:
"The Origin of Thanksgiving." by Lillie
Leeman; recitation, by Sophie Struss;
recitation, by Leah Wrede. and the sing
ing of songs appropriate to the occasion.
The several numbers were delivered with
a great deal of regard to the effect in
tended to be conveyed upon the hearers,
and each contributor did her best. The
programme was followed by the serving
of a ccllatlon and a social hour. The
parlor appointed a committee to make ar
rangements for the observance of "moth
er's day," when a programme Is to be
presented for the entertainment of moth
ers of members.
Sans Souci Parlor had a very enjoy
able home in its hall in the Odd Fel
lows' building 1 on the second Monday
In the- current month. ThÂ» members

was attired In the color of that point.
The installing officers were Retiring
Matron Minnie Sophie Reed and Paat
Matron Thercse Fredericks, marshal,
each doing her work with a precision
that was most commendable. The mu
sic was, by the chapter quartet â A. E.
McMillan, Edgerton Smith, A- C. Read
and R. E. Keeneâ with solos by Miss
Gillespie, Miss Ethel Marguerita
Schantz and Henry Mauser. At th,e

Chapter in the South San Francisco
Masonic Hall in the presence of a large
number of people. Emma Caroline

matron, \u25a0 together with the other offi
cers, whose names have already been
published, lay Miaa Geneva Williams,
the^ retiring matron, assisted by Mary
E. Donoho, past matron, as installing
marshal. The work of the. Installing
officer without a book was a marvel
ous feat of memorising, when the fact I
Is taken into consideration that there
was not a word left out nor a word
added in the entire ceremony. The
marshal's work was highly commend
ed. At the close of the ceremony of
installation the new matron, who is
possessed of a clear commanding Voice,
called upon Grand Patron ..Florin . L.

ing address on the order, after which
Past Patron John S. Partridge, on be
half of the chapter, presented a hand
some jewel to Miss Williams, the retir
ing matron, and in hie speech com
mended her for the very admirable
manner In which she had conducted
the affairs of the .chapter during her
term and for the splendid manner In
which she had installed the officers.
This was followed by the presentation
of a jewel to the retiring patron, the
giving of pretty Jewel cases to the re
tiring points of the star and of a beau
tifully decorated tankard to Nellie Au
gusta Darling In recognition of her
services to the chapter in the past
twelve years. \ The music at the instal
lation was by the Knickerbocker Quar
tet, The ceremonies closed ; with'
dancing. Everything In the affair was
commendable, but something that was
the subject of considerable comment
was that those who are entitled â¢ to
seats In the East, particularly ; grand
officers, were not' invited therel but
were permitted to take back seats In
the hall. _â¢ ' :

the most charming that has been heard
this year, the selections being far above
those usually presented on occasions
of 'this kind. The singing by the quar
tet won the praise of the several hun

while the solos by Miss Gordon, Mrs.

to . them all lovers of music. Mrs.

though applause was strongly ' n evi
dence when the quartet, at the request
Of Mrs. Gordon, the newly installed
matron, who is president of the Treble
Clef Club, rendered a charming selec
tion. Mrs. Hendry proved herself an
ideal installing officer, silvering . her
charges to the several officers with a
naturalness characteristic of her
charming personality. At. the close of
tho ceremony and tho proclamation
Mrs. Kate J. Willats, the grand secre
tary, was called upon for a few re
marks. She was followed by Grand
Treasurer Mrs. Helen Seaman, after
which James Edward Gordon, who had
been- installed aa proxy for Chaplain
Frank McGowan, absent from the cere
mony on account of the death of his
mother, onbehalf of the chapter pre
sented to Mrs. Hendry, the retiring
matron, a beautiful and valuable Jewel
of her rank as past matron, after which
Samuel Charles- Wallis, the retiring
patron, was presented an emblematic
pin, both of these tokens being in ap
preciation of the excellent- and con
scientious work of each during their
term of office. Then there. was the pre
sentation of > a . most ' beautiful vase,
flower embellished by ono of the mem
bers of the chapter as a token of sis
terly and brotherly love from the of
ficers of the' past term to the .retiring
matron. This ,lady in: accepting this
used language expressive of the deep
est heartfelt gratitude and said of her
officers that they were as loving as
they are lovable, and that their loy
alty was as true ; as steel. The points
of the star of last year showed' their
respect for one "who had proved him
self a true gentleman and kindest of
masters of the work" ; ; by presenting
Past Patron Wallls a' magnificent tan
kard. Then there was the presentation
to each of the points of 'the star of last

daytime, as Is done in Philadelphia.
Thl3 is intended for such persons who
are eligible to membership, but who on
account of employment that requires
their attention at night are unable to
attend sessions of courts that hold
night sessions.
There was a large class initiation in
the court at Sausalito last week. The
work was performed in a most excel
lent manner by the team of Court San
Francisco. After the ceremony, there
were addresses by Grand Secretary
Cordy, Piist Chief Ranger Jacob Label
and many others, after which there was
v banquet.
The visit of Grand Chief Companion
Mrs. Tucker to Mt. Vernon Circle in the
Alcazar building. was one of the most
delightful of the season. The attend
ance of members, grand officers and
visitors was large and the work of the
officers in the initiation of candidates
was unusually well done, particularly
that by the chief companion and the
sub chief, each delivering her part with
the full dramatic effect demanded by
the ritual. The intonation of each of
these officers in the delivery of the
charges to the candidates demonstrated
that elocution is absolutely requisite
to make the initiatory ceremony what
it should be, and on this occasion each
of the officers named gave an object
lesson* that all others occupying the
the same position should learn. The
official drill team under the captaincy
of Grand Sub Chief Mate H. Cartwright
added much to the impresslveness of
thu occasion. The drill team of Ex
celsior Circle was present in ita pretty
uniform of white and gold and three
of ; the members- filled vacancies occa
sioned by the unavoidable rabsence of
some of the official team. The' work
of the evening was followed by an ad
dress by the grand chief companion,
the grand sub chief, Grand Marshal
Coyle, Past Grand Mrs. Worms, Past
Grand Mrs. Harrington, Past Grand
Mr 3. Kemp Van Ec and others. . The
grand chief was presented a handsome
souvenir of the visit and. then Mrs.
Worms, who is deputy for the circle,
was, as a token of appreciation of .her
Interest for the organization, presented
a fine silk umbrella and the chief com
panion presented her, as a personal
gift; a handsome silk belt. ' :
Ancient Order Foresters;
A new court- of the Ancient Order of
Foresters was instituted in Fillmore, in
this ' State, in the latter part of Novem
ber with thirty charter members by Spe
cial Deputy Willis. '
! In the past three months- the court
at Fulton made. a. net gain of twenty
flve members.
Court Occidental had a smoker last
week, at which there was presented
an excellent- programme of vaudeville
numbers to a very -large number of the

Whether thÂ« third of Carreno's hua
be.r.ds (of my acquaintance) or the sec
ond of the great French violinists. Is the
more Interesting is hard to say. They
are both herÂ© this weekâ M. Bmile Sauret.
Of a truth I had forgotten Sauret's mari
tal distinction when I went to chat with
him the other day. He himself reminded
me. It came up apropos of the violinist's
historic visit here of twenty -five years
ago.
A handsome shrug, end & "ma. fol. but
that is a hundred years aÂ«o!" met my
first question as to the San Francisco of
that day. Yet, lest I of the younger day
should feel undue pride-, Sauret told me
proud things of San Francisoo'o yester
day.
It* was in that big house of to-day, the
pt. Francis, that we talked. When Sauret
yaÂ» last here, he told us, the people were
aelightediy agape over the beginnings of
the Enlace. The Parisian spoke there:
''How strange then was the dress of the
PÂ«JOple'.,An awful eccentricity! but now"
(ihis for my sisters) "It is in the streets
the same as in Paris."
There was ihe bay, oertainement, in tha*.
far diy, and the hills. But theTe was
Oothlr.g else! Such poor ferry-boats! no
Kerry station, but now; "e'est grandiose,
cYst magninque."
But. 1 must remember, the violinist in
elsted, that there was a musical public
then. Bmall. but extremely cultivated. Oh,
%'f-sl They had played very good pro
grammes. One would be furprised. And
they were most generously received.
"You did not play with orchestra?" I
had asked â perhaps jealously.
No, M. Sauret had played with the pi
Â©.no, with Madame Carreno, who was his
first wife. I must remember.
No, 1 had forgotten. Besides, I did
not quite know ihe propriety of dangling
what might be supposed to be a family
.skeleton before the interviewed.. M.
Eauret, however, settled it, quite In the
Â£haw vein. He laughed good-naturedly at
:ny hesitant "oh. yes!" and put it:
"Carreno, she likes to change! She is a
Mormon! Very good!"
And in the Shaw vÂ«?in I answered him:
"I mÂ«?t M. d' Albert last spring"
"Ah!" commented Madame Carreno's
first husband on her second. "Ke is a
magnificent artist. D' Albert plays the
piano like a god."
1 continued with account of what kind
of naughty little god D'Albert had played
like in Ban Francisco, and the wars
therefrom.
Then M. Sauret summoned to the de
fense Mr. Arthur Speed, his accompany
ing pianist, who came in just here, with:
"D'Albert, is he not the greatest of them
allâ mille fois plus grand artist?"
And Air. Speed thought so, saying that
probably the pianist during his visit here
xvas too much occupied with his opera â
one could not do well two things at once.
That he was the greatest artist of* them
ail, there was not a doubt.
.Desperately I wondered then if it were
mere politeness to 'mention Josef Hof
mann, third in the Carreno succession,
but U. Sauret seemingly unceremoniously
forgot him. Instead he began to talk of
the audience of the evening before, while
1 decided that at least M. Sauret is the
handsomest of the Carreno sposl, with
his soft," brilliant, humorous black eyes,
fine olive color, and profound air
of distinction. He has iesÂ« of the black
hair that 4s his than he had twenty-live
years ago â as he later explained with rue
ful humor, the result of wearing It long
then! French, exquisitely polished, he
prefers to speak, but conceded an en
gaging English to his audienceâ besides
those mentioned a gifted little girl fld
cler and her mother.
But M. Sauret was "delighted, sur
prised, with the reception of. the
Schumann sonata â I had been told not
to play it. But It was a charming,
most appreciative audience!" he granted.
He beamed Et this: ' "I have seen al
ready here five of my pupils. I was
very pleased to see my little chickens.
You have here now," he queried, "many
good musicians, certainly?"
"So many," I ventured, "that when
you rome next time. M. Sauret, we hope
there will bo a symphony orchestra for
you to play with!"
Naturally, I did not forget our one
little evr> lamb of a symphony concert,
the Polacco, nor mention of the Wolle
symphony concerts that the spring will
bring.
\u25a0M. Sauret did not mean unhandsome
ly, but after his sympathetic "That is
good," he began to talk of music In

Chicago. (He lives there, \ I learned
then, for the present.) It was a list of
all the things musical that Chicago haa
â and we haven't; from' German, Ital
ian, French musical societies to thÂ»
Chicago Symphony Orchestra, "one of
the best symphony orchestras- In the
world," he said. Only three hours a
day, every day, and at two concerts a
week, the public rehearsal and the reg
ular concert, these Chicago men play
together! Poor men of ours! worrying
a llvelfhood from the cafes, the thea
ters, from dances, from teaching,
dragging to a scant three^ rehearsals â
and these cut to a gloriously ridiculous
two hours by the union â for the one
symphony concert of the year!
What our men had done in this case
I boasted here to the man from Chi
cago.
"But." he said, "you must do what
Chicago did for Thomas. When he went
there years ago he did not mean to
stay. One concert he gave, then an
other, and another. Then one wealthy
citizen gave some money, then another,
for other concerts. Thomas stayed
three months, then it was a year. Then
the Chicago people found they could
not do without the concerts. So must
you do here. There must be first a
guarantee â "
I threw in here the name of Mr. F. M.
Smith, the generous guarantor of the
Wolle concerts, to Mr. Saurefs "Armour",
of Chicago.
"How can the men play their best If
they have to play in the cafe, in the
theater?" he asked, pitying hands in
the air. "And they must play In
the cafe. There is, perhaps a wife,
perhaps a mother, children; they. must
have bread. It Is not the musician's
fault that he is at the cafe. Americans
axe Instinctively generous. It needs
only for the matter to be put before
them properlyâ l believe you will soon
hayÂ« your symphony society! 0 "and out
went the plump, impulsive Sauret hand
to mine.
"Thank you, for us," I said.
They have more temperament In the
Chicago organization, thinks M. Sau
ret, than in the famous Boston sym
phony orchestra. There was a delicious
bit of hand-play, almost like Salassa's,
in the description of Boston's orches
tra, its impossible finesse, its fabulous
purity of ensemble, its marvelous aca
demic accuracy. For the Pittsburg or
chestra he had also many good words,
also for that of Cincinnati â where Mr.
Hans Wagner comes from.
"New York," he said, and stopped,
shrugged his shoulders, "oh, New York
is New York, international. But there
is a tremendous improvement musi
cally all over America. In even the
small towns one can now play tho big
music. It is through" â only a tiny,
matter-of-fact bow pointed this â "the
ladies! C'est la femme. e'est vrai!
The ladies have the time. They go to
the concert, to the lecture, to the thea
ter. They educate the man. They give
to him the thing they take from the
concert. It is the mission of the Amer
ican girl. He works all the time. He
likes to work." M. Sauret's shrug was
sympathetic, y*Â»t a shrug. "No work,
no man. I have seen him, in Europe,
say before a Correggio. 'It Is beauti
ful,' he says, 'but what is going on at
my office In Chicago?* "
"What do you think, then, in these
circumstances, of the chance of Ameri
can music?" I asked, without flinching.
"* M. Sauret did not know, but .asked
me to remember that "the country is
young â give it a chance!" Men that
have already done things, he mention
ed, taacDowell, Foote and others. The
, way lies, he thinks, through the pre-
I servatlon of the native music, Indian,
negro; in its development. â¢ Most na
tional music has been founded upon the
folk song. Think of your Grieg, all
Norwegian; your Lassen. so German;
your Lizat, the Magyar â "
"Your Beethoven." I interpolated.
M. Sauret threw up his hands and
laughed. "Oh, your Beethoven! He is
one. Your Shakespeare is one. Your
Christ is one. There Is only one."
Still, the violinist thinks there is
| every chance for an American national
I art. Ho Is persuaded that Its day is
! not so far off, and that Its way Is
j through the folk song, as with all na
! tlonal skiging. \
Tfce student came up then, and Sauret
mentioned himself as pupil of De Beriot
and Vieuxtemps.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY. DECEMBER 17, 1905.
"And M. Sauret!" I added.
"Of course," the great French master
agreed, "you are always your own pupil.
Systemsâ humbug! Each one has a dif
ferent system. One has twenty vol
umes," Sauret's arms stretched to them,
"to teach in forty years how to make a
trill. Bah! Those who are to be great
artist will be great artist. Two and two
always make four. You cannot change.
Yes! one must have good principles, har
mony, orchestration, history \ and then
KNOW WHAT YOU WANT."
And there I found M. Sauret's keynote
âhe kn6ws what he wants.

Naught new Nance O'Neil offers this
week, but for her an old play, "Camille,"
most appropriately after this week's bill,
"Magda," and "Elizabeth." Many yeara
it is since Miss O'Neil was seen as Ca
mille, and little curiosity as there is now
concerning the playâ and the less the bet
terâthere will be much to see the Ca
mllle. "Magda"' begins the week, its cen
tral role one of the actress' greatest char
acterizations. Nor can one afford to miss
her in "Elizabeth." One can less afford
to miss her here than in any. of the plays,
in fact. For here is where Miss O'Neil's
characteristic distinctions have their wid
est scope, the heroic gesture, the grand air,
the large, tragic diction, those things that
make her what she is, a modern Ristori.
Her death scene is a tremendous thing.
It was in this scene, done by Charlotte
Cushman/ that a celebrated doctor made
for the stage, shouting: "The woman's
dead!" One feels that way when Miss
O'Neil plays it. .

Dick Hotaling's
New "Shylock"
To-morrow evening will add a new Shy
lock to history, entirely home-grown and
of other interest, eke one "Dick" Hotal
ing's. The man that does not want to play
Romeo, if he, wishes to play anything
marks out a Shylock. And Shylock is
Mr. Hotaling's desire. Prophecy would
be safer on Tuesday than to-day, but the
warrant for Mr. Hotaline's desire would
eeem totbe considerably more powerful
than in 'the usual case. I have not seen
the new Shylock act, but I have heard
Mr. Hotaling read,, and at this rarest of
accomplishments he is one of the most
accomplished it has been my luck to hear.
He besins with a voice that it is a- sin
to waste upon a private life, and reads
with what. If It- were a Mansfield one
spoke of. one would freely dub a brilliant
intelligence, not to speak of an unfailing
poetry. Mr. Hotaling has his own ideas
of Shylock, naturallyâ one that his lines
should be flavored Jewlshly, but we shall
see. That the performance will be inter
esting there is no manner of doubt, and
that the Doctor's Daughters, for whom
the affair will bo given, will be vastly
benefited thereby' the Majestic records
for to-morrow night handsomely testify.

Californian Is evident in v the execution of
these exquisite portraits, notably "La
Jeunesse" and "Beatrice." Later than
these are three heads, each with its own
Individuality and mood, that are simply
stunning. It is in this type of work, por
traiture, real arid ideal, that I like Green
baum bestâ and this not to undervalue his
landscapes, for in this phase of work he
has demonstrated his worth in some
paintable bits of Golden Gate Park, nota
bly about the^Chain of Lakes. \u25a0
In ~ these canvases there Is demonstra
tion of' a fine poetic feeling, a supercon
sciousness of the moods of nature. Take
those deep red sunsets of his,. for instance,
with the landscape aglow with the ruddy
light of) the lowering fireball. There you
have a little poem of departing day, but
bearing a new messageâ one of gladness
and cheer, a suggestion of eternal day?

and that Charles Keeler, gentle
poet lover, should voice the song. And
so it was done and "Abt Vogler" was
read, and other songs of Browning, air
voicing the bright faith of the old-mu
sician, and almost, think those who
were there, the fine old face smiled
from its heights of peace.
Seven years ago Henry Holmes came
here, with sons and .laughters to whom
he wished to giv- the larger chances of
the New World. From London, where
he was born in 1539. he came here, con
tinuing a career that was as remark
able aa it was honorable. Mr. Holmes
and his brother â also a violinist of dis
tinction â were pupils of their father.
.who most singularly could not play at
all himself, but whose teaching of thb
two youngsters wa3 of such success
ful nature as to meet the approval at
such men as Spohr. and to carry the
young players with all eclat through a
brilliant concert tour upon the Conti
nent. Mr. Holmes after this spent con
siderable time in Copenhagen,, Stock
holm and Vienna, during which time ho
came to know the Princess Alexandra,
now Queen of England, to whom. as
Princess of Wales, he gave lessons in
ensemble playing.
Afterward he settled in London, en
tering upon a career of brilliant and
varied artlvity.
He led the famous Holmes chamber
music concerts for a considerable pe
riod, winning here his first distinction.
After this he was chosen to succeed
Joachim as conductor oi tbe Monday
Popular Concerts; but it la possibly
as the founder of the orchestra of the
Royal College of Mu3lc that Mr.
Holmes la best known. ,
As a composer possibly his string
quartets and quintets, some of distin
guished beauty, best represent Henry
Holmes. His works, however, include
many other* forms of composition, sym
phonies, cantatas and violin works
among .them. One of his symphonies,
"Fraternity," was played by the local
symphony orchestra some few years
ago, under Mr. Holmes' own direction.
His quartets, too. have also been given
here, in the chamber musio concerts
led by Mr. Holmes, in which his gifted
little pupil. Kathleen Parlow. used to
play. Mr. Holmes" local career haa been
chiefly that of the teacher. It has been
marked. It seems almost superfluous t<>
say, by the samo high devotion to the
artistic Ideal, the same superb earnest
ness, the same magnificent conscience,
that has characterized his life through
out. . Compromise for him there was
none â things mundane might have
been less duiicult ha 3 there been. But
"The high that proved too high, the
heroic for earth too hard,"
Is for him no longer; and for us only
the tempered regret for one who has
done his work, and done It well.

LAURA BRIDE POWERS

This sparkling, clever, high-strung little
woman will enable Miss O'Ryan to pro
duce In San Francisco something of ths
type of work that won her recognition
in New Yorkâ where -recognition isn't
picked off rose bushes.
It Is somewhat amusing to hear pat
ronizing painter folkâ mostly women, by
the wayâ say in a superior manner: **Why
doesn't Miss O'Ryan keep to her minia
ture work. She does that so well!**
In answer. I would say that miniatura
workâ of .which Miss O'Ryan Is the Une3t
exponent on the coast, with Miss Grace
Wishaar a worthy secondâ was taken up
in San Francisco upon her arrival. 3imply
because there was v demand for it.
She had done many superb i^>rie* in
New. York, and her reputation had pre
ceded hw. The people here clamored for
miniature, to the exclusion cf large por
traits; and now the pendulum is swinging
backâ hence the resumption of her paint
ing in oils, which she alternates with her
miniatures. I trust the apology will be
accepted.
The very qualities that distinguish Miss
Â©"Ryan's work have come Into it from
her big work; and that Is the secret of
the success of Grace Wishaar, whose
boldness of treatment has come to her
fromâ now, what do you, suppose?â from
scene painting in a theater.
Tht3 little woman, who doesn't look a
minute over 20, frail but terribly in ear
nest.* with a pair of black eyes that look
holes through you, is the scenic painter
of the Majestic and Ye Liberty theaters.
It. Is this training that is taking tho
namby-pambyism out of her miniatures.

A stunning girl is Miss Margaret Gro3,
the erstwhile Parisienne, who like Miss
Helene Robson. Is apt to address you in
French if she isn't on guard.
Miss Gros wears her hair in the fash
ion that's affected by all Paris and all
smart Gothamâ great masses of it piled
up and out, not only framing the face,
but making a foundation for the mad hats
that are de rlgueur.
This dressing of the. hair to fit the hat
has brought into vogue the time-honored
cachepeigne â the excrescence upon* a hat
that tilts it to the desired angle, and
from which dangle a dozen naughty little
curls.
At the dances Miss Gros is a dashing
damosel, and, although San Francisco
isn't Paris, she seems to have a merry
time at ahemâ she and her devoted friend,
May Colburn. And apropos of Miss Col
burn, there's not a more charming girl in
town. Mrs. Ernest Stent is the nearest
approach to herein point of kindly dispo
sition and breeding. It takes the moni
tors of society to know who's who, and
it doesn't take us long to find out, either.
Such a worker as Miss McEwen, presi
dent of the Doctor's Daughters, would
make anything go. She's a wonderâ she,
with Miss Jennie Blair as a side partner.
Together, I am firm In the belief that
they could conduct the city government, If
the Mayor wanted to take a holiday.
Since the munificent offer of Mr. Hotal
ing and the others of the "Merchant of
Venice" cast. Miss McEwen and her co
horts have attended to every detail of the
business of the affair, leaving to the gal
lant Mr. Shylock the details of the pro
duction, costuming, etc. And the ladles
are profuse In their laudations of him for
the, eplendid service he has already ren
dered them. -
But in the matter of programmes,
tickets, theater and arrangements therein,
the Daughters have done the bulk of the
workâ and done it well.
No advertising solicitor waxed fat upon
their popularity â they got their own ad
vertisements, and by this expenditure of
energy and the pocketing of a little pride,
they have made many hundred dollars.
Mrs. E. de Noon Lewis and her win
some sister, Miss Mabel de Noon, were
hostesses at a second card affair last
Monday at .the Hotel Pendleton. Many
tables were placed for bridge and five
hundred, and a merry chatter followed
the distribution of the prizes â as is
usual.
The Gaiety Club dance on Thursday
night was a pretty affair, almost the
full complement of the membership be
ing on hand. So, too, wero the bach
elors, who may be labeled, as we do our
best canned fruits, "selected."

SOUL BUXDNESS ADDED
TO LIST OF DISEASES
Vldlm Able to S**, bnt Cannot IteaÂ«l
anil Ha* l.tiyne* ot
Memory.
BERLIN', Dec. 16.â "Soul blindness"
is the name given by Professor Schus
ter to the latest discovered disease. An
elderly man who had received a good
education arrived recently from Russia
end placed himself under Schuster's
care. He was suffering from curious
lapses of memory and mental associa
tion. Schuster put him under observa
tion and found he could not read, that
the series of letters forming word 3 per
fectly familiar to him conveyed . no
meaning to his mind. He spoke quite
coherently and showed no other symp*
toms of disease.
He was asked to write the simple
sentence, "I am hungry." but . when
Schuster asked him to name the indi
vidual letters and point them out he
could riot do 30. His sight was normal;
.he recognized and named all the ob
jects around him. but when the sim
plest objects were sketched on paper
he was utterly at fault and unable to
say whether a boat wa3 a tree or a
house.
Professor Schuster explains the dis
ease by saying the connection between
his visual organs and his powers of
associating ideas has been sundered,
and it Is doubtful whether t! j connec
tion will ever again be made.
Equally singular Is a discovery made
by Dr. Her t wise of Stuttgart, who has a
woman under treatment who while In
a state of somnolency is in possession
of all her waking faculties; when ad
dressed she answers clearly and sen
sibly; In speaking to her It is not neces
sary to raise the voice above a whis
per. Her eyes are closed as in ordinary
sleep, but when spoken to she sees
everything around her with which she
Is familiar steeped In a deep blue at

AND ENDS LIFE
Mrs. Lillie Arditto Commits
Suicide While Despondent
Over Husband's Sickness
DRINKS CARBOLIC ACID
Leaves Pitiful Note, Plead
ing That Kindness Be Ex
tended to Her Two Babies
Mrs. Lillie Arditto committed suicide at
her residence, 3156 Twenty-fifth street,
shortly before noon yesterday by drink
ing the contents of a bottle of carbolic
acid. Despondency caused by her hus
band's epileptic fits is attributed as the
only reason for the rash act. Her hus
band. David Arditto. a bricklayer, em
ployed by the Board of Public Works,
had one of the fits in front of his resi
dence on Friday night, which almost
drove her frantic.
Shortly before noon Mrs. Arditto's little
Sirl Grade, 5 years of age, was in the
house, with her and the child saw her
drink the poison. She screamed and ran
to her aunt. Mrs. Lizzie Brumfleld, who
lives at 3162 Twenty-fifth street, and told
what her mother had done. Mrs. Brum
field ran to the house and at once sum
moned Dr. H. O. yon der Lieth, who
found on arriving that there was no hope,
and Mrs. Arditto died in a few minutes.
The body was removed to the Morgue by
Deputy Coroner Brown.
Besides the little girl there is another
daughter Madeline, 7 years of age. Mrs.
Arditto was 26 years of age and her
neighbors all speak well of her.
She had left a note written in pencil
which reads:
"For God's sake, be good to my babies.
I tried to live for their sakes, but the fu
ture looks darker than the past, and 1
can't stand it any longer. I would like to
take them with me, but I haven't the
courage. I can't stand it any longer. Oh,
my God, be good to my babies! I hate tc
leave them, but if I stay I might make
things worse for them. Be good to them
and remember every time you say a harsh
word to them you are hurting me. Good-by
all, and God blfcss you! God forgive me, I
am a coward. Don't be mean to Made
line. If she is a little wild she will grow
out of that after a while, and pleas-i be
good to her. If you possibly can keep
both my babies together: don't separate
them."

Oil well discoveries, the building of

of fuel oil constitute a great and vital
industry in California to-day. The As
sociated Oil Company has won particu
lar distinction by handling all those
problems to the satisfaction of its cus
tomers and to the betterment of thase
industries that "depend upon fuel oil.
The magnificent plant of the Associ
ated Oil Company has been greatly en
larged and improved'dtrrJng the last
year both by the expenditure of skill
and money and by the acquirement of
the Amalgamated Oil Company's plant
and business
Formerly the Associated Company
operated in the Kern River and McKit
trick districts only, but its new hold
ings include magnificent properties in
the Coalinga and Los Angeles oil belts.
The output of the company is very
large and its facilities are the very
best. Tankage capacity of 3,000,000
barrels has been provided, which in
sures a steady supply. Strange as il
may seem, this great company is to
day furnishing more than one-third of
the fuel oil used in the State.
The Associated Oil Company is now
ready to ship from its own tanks, and
stations to all points in California and
Arizona.

LEACH TELLS
ABOUT ADAMS
Explains How the Seattle
Cashier Stole a Fortune
in Gold Dust of Miners
SUEE TEAP IS LAID
Director Eoberts Lends His
Assistance to Catch a
Very Cunning Criminal
Frank A. Leach, superintendent, and
George E. Roberts, director of the
United States Branch Mint in this city,
returned from Seattle yesterday, where
they had been investigating: the theft
of about $160,000 in gold dust, deposited
within the last five or six years by, min
ing men at the Seattle assay office., The'
arrest of George E. Adams, the cashier,
and hla confession have been already
published. He is now in jail at Seat
tle, his bondsmen having surrendered
him.- Mr. Roberts will letve for Wash
ington this morning.
Mr. Leach tells an interesting story
as to the manner in which Adams suc
ceeded in abstracting the gold ;dust
without suspicion. It appeared' that
gold dust reaching the assay office dur-,
ing the forenoon was weighed .on" re
ceipt and then sent to .the 'melter, who
also weighed it, after which it. was
melted into bars. Gold, dust arriving in
the afternoon was, taken charge of by
Adams and placed in hla safe over
night in order that it might Jbe turned
over to the melter in the morning.
Adams kept. in his pockets a quantity
of different sizes of veterinary capsules,
containing one-half ounce,;. one _ ounce
and two ounces of sand respectively.
GIVES SAND FOR GOLD.
Then,- from a package of gold dust,
according to its weight, Adams would
extract from half an ounce to two
ounces of gold dust and replace the
weight taken with sand. He began, in
1901 to take about one-quarter of 1 per
cent, but -lately he raised the quantlty
to nearly 2 per cent. There is always
some shrinkage in the weight of gold
dust when it is made Into bars be
cause of sand that is taken outof it be
fore being melted, but the shrinkage at
the Seattle assay office was so much
greater than normal that complaint-was
made to Washington by some of the de
positors and Messrs. Leach and Roberts,
were sent to investigate the matter last
month.
It was thought at first, that the leak
age was in the melting room, and in or
der to discover the thief packages of gold
dust that had been cleaned of all the
sand and some that. had been cleaned of
all but a certain weight of sand were
Â«ent to the assay office in the forenoon
and direct to the melter. It was returned
of the correct weight and not more than
normal shrinkage. The cashier being the
only other person in charge of the gold,
was then suspected, and a package of
cleaned gold dust was sent to the office
in the afternoon bo that Adams might
put it into his safe. When it reached the
melter it showed the correct weight, but
contained a Quantity of sand eaual in
weight to the gold abstracted. A pair
of sold scales belonging, to Adams was
found in his safe. . ;". \u25a0 :\u25a0 : â¢ â¢ - .
ADAMS A RICH MAX.
. Adams was arrested on November 23
and $12,000 in currency was found on his
person. He also turned over to his cap
tors $400 worth of stolen- gold dust and
$7000 was found In his house. He admit
ted that during the present year he had
taken $35,000 worth of dust, but that was
all the admission he would. make.
Adams is wealthy and penurious. He
had invested $50,000 in real estate, he
owned an irqn works at Bellingham Bay,
he had $10,000 invested in a real estate
and insurance business, he bought a new
style of automobile whenever one came
out and he built a fine residence for him
self at a cost of $20,000.
Merrill A. Martin, assistant assayer at
the branch mint in San Francisco, has
been ordered to Seattle to take charge of
the assay department and L. S. Kerfoot
will take the position of chief clerk.;
MRS. BENSON SAYS SHE
WAS INCORRECTLY QUOTED
Paper Prepared fot Her, She Declares,
Related. Only to Marriage, Race
Suicide and Divorce.
In The Call of December. ls was an
article on a meeting of the Political
Equality Club of Berkeley, .in which
it. was stated that a paper prepared
by Mrs. Louise Benson was read. In
The Call article it was stated that Mrs.
Benson argued for women's participa
tion in law-making powers, especially
where laws that bear most directly
upon women's interests are concerned.
Upon that subject Mrs. Benson asks
a correction, saying: "The paper was
an unbiased examination from histori
cal and scientific standpoints, of vari
ous expert opinions upon the three
questions named â marriage, race sui
cide and divorce â and had no reference
to womanhood snffrage, nor to the
views of ex-President Cleveland - re
garding the suffrage. The words 'suf
frage' and 'franchise' were foreign to
my paper, nor did I argue for woman's
participation in law-making powers."
A Hotel of .Comfort.
San Francisco contains many build
ings as well as many nooks and parks
that are famous for their originality or
their historic* association. The Occi
dental Hotel is one of the hostelries of
the city, and of the world for that mat
ter, Which has virtues that make it
stand apart.- . .
The cozy and ample rooms, the cen
tral location, the food one gets there
and the people one meets there â these
make the Occidental forever homelike
and forever welcome. â¢
distinguished travelers from the Ori
ent, naval and military men of note, as
well as pioneers and men and women of
leisure choose the Occidental as a quiet
place of comfort and rest.'
It ia difficult to define' that subtle
charm which inheres in some places,
but in some indescribable way the Oc
cidental has an atmosphere that lures
and holds lovers of good living. There
is probably no hotel in America that
has more of that haunting attractive
ness' that delights the guest than is
found at the Occidental, as If the spirit
of some historic inn dwelt within the
walls of the attractive. Montgomery
street hotel. Its central location does
not destroy the quiet that is one of its
principal charms. ; '^ â¢.- .*

SAYS THE CITY MUST
KETUKX THE TAXES
United Bailroads Entitled to
Money It Paid Into
The City -Attorney yesterday morning
rendered to the Board of Supervisors his
opinion regarding the taxes collected from
the United Railroads some time ago. The
City Attorney, after considering the re
cent decision of the Supreme Court, de
clares the money should be returned. Fol
lowing is the opinion in full:
"Gentlemen: I have your reference of
December 12, 1905, inclosing the petition
of the United Railroads for the refunding
to it fit certain taxes paid upon certain
properties assessed for the fiscal year
ending June 30, 1905,' on account of the
levy forthe redemption of bonds and pay
ment of interest thereon proposed to be
issued for the acquisition of a site for a
public park on Telegraph Hill. The -tax
was levied in anticipation of a decision
by the Supreme Court of the State in an
action then pending favorable to the va
lidity of such bonds. On August 15, 1904.
however, such decision ;was rendered, de
claring void., the proceedings heretofore
taken to provide for the Issuance of such
bonds, owing to the failure of the propo
sition to Issue the same to receive two
thirds of the votes cast at the election
held , for that purpose. (Law vs. San
Francisco, 144 Cal., 354.) \u25a0
"After quoting the statutory and consti
tutional questions covering the matter the
court says: 'It scarcely admits of doubt
that this section contemplates and re
quires a favorable two-thirds vote of all
the votes cast at the eelction, and that.

accordingly, the proposition to Issue

"It follows that a tax levied for the re

that could not be issued was void and
should be refunded. (Pacific Coast Com

CHRISTMAS CHEER.
THE coming great holiday finds our country favored with the
largest crops and the most cash in hand in all its history. This
high material condition is enjoyed side by side with "other condi
tions that become a high spirited and self-governing people. What
virtues we have are meekly worn, and what evils are among us are
openly fought. The expurgating power of public opinion is abroad
jerith the spirit of reform, and everywhere is the bright promise of
the perpetuity of our civil institutions.
Wealth and luxury are the insidious enemies of human society
and government. The ancient empires were infected by them and
fell. But they were trained to ethics different from ours, and existed
in a fixed disregard of the rights of the masses and the needs of the
weak and poor. The signs of these times are so different that they
cannot be translated by the alphabet of ancient history. Our rich
are less a menace than the ancient rich because they recognize the
obligations of moral stewardship and are moved by the spirit, of
redistribution of wealth. As long as there is abroad a hearty con
tempt for the mean or dishonest rich man, and a firm determination
to hold him amenable to statutory and moral Jaw, the wealth of the
country will be consistent with the endurance of its institutions. It
is when there is general assent to the legal immunity of the rich that
their presence in a country becomes a fatal disease.. ,
In this land, where the law is made by all and is administered
by ail and must be respected and obeyed by all, the gifts of nature
in those resources which constitute potential wealth may be fear
lessly developed in the certainty that all will get a fair share of the
results, and that dishonest gains will not always stay in the dishonest
hands that win them.
In the midst of what would have been appalling prosperity in
other ages, we justly fix our confidence in our safety upon the effect
of Christianity, real Christianity, upon our civil ' institutions, of
which it is the saving grace. This Christmas holiday is suggestive
of the salt that has savored the earth since the old empires were en
riched to rottenness, and there was no pervasive moral principle
that could heal their infirmites. *
The Call sends its annual greeting to-day that its most distant
friends may be reached in season. It is an expression of good will
and an ascription to the great State that gives its people the kindest
sunshine, and the softest skies that are upon the holiday season any
where on the planet.
THE MILAN EXPOSITION.
ITALY has decided to celebrate the opening of the great Simplon
tunnel by an international exposition of industries, products,
machinery, decorative art, and of fisheries, zoology and forestry.
This will be held at Milan, and will extend from April to November,
1906. This exposition is a novelty in its occasion. In this country
we have had great international expositions celebrating the centen
nial of the republic, the discovery of America, the acquisition of
Louisiana and the exploration of the Northwest by Lewis and
Clark. These were celebrations of events long crystallized in his
tory, but Italy proposes to celebrate a current event, something
so modern that the opening of the tunnel and of the exposition
will be concurrent.
The idea is fetching. It gains piquancy from the fact that
Italy has pick and choice of anniversaries of ancient events. â¢ Rome
still stands on the hills where it was planted 2659 years ago. Italy
could celebrate that foundation, or the crossing of the Rubicon,
or any other of a myriad of events that make up the charms of
history. But that old land prefers to celebrate an up-to-date event,
which is a triumph of modern engineering, a greater event than
building the Cloaca Maxima, the Appian way, or the palace of the
Caesars.
Milan is a great focus of tourist travel and a business city of
the first class. It is in the valley of the Po, a region of surpassing
interest to Californians, for its object lesson in irrigation. This
State has received many desirable accessions to its population and
enterprise from that part of Italy. The business energy of our
Italian citizens is shown in their maintenance of an Italian Chamber
of Commerce in San Francisco. They are eager that the products
of this State shall share the attractions of the Milan exposition.
It is expected that our Federal Government will officially rec
ognize the event and that this country will be well represented
there. California especially has reasons forsaking space and
spreading her phylactery at Milan. The trade between this port
and Italy is of significant sum and capable of increase by enlarging
our acquaintance with the old land. The time" given to the ex
position is ample to secure a good display of our characteristic
products. We should not be timorous in showing the products
which compete with Italy. Our wines, olive oil, fruits and cereals
need suffer nothing by comparison. Millions of travelers pass
through Milan. They will visit the Simplon exposition, and if will
be well to show them that there is in climate, and products a
younger Italy, in California. % .
The Call is ,sure that our producers and exporters will take
up the matter of representation with energy and effect.
THE SOLDIERS' MONUMENT.
WHEN we began the Spanish war no man could foresee the
end. It was believed that our lack of powder and preparation
served to equalize the power of the combatants, while on
paper the Spanish navy outranked us. Our soldiers had to go to
service in the pestiferous tropical climate and meet foes in the form
of disease more dangerous than the embattled enemy. The service
had btst few allurements, and those who volunteered for it were
moved by no motive except patriotism. i>Â£-v v'->\
It is remembered with pride that California patriotism over
subscribed the demand of the Government. Our volunteers who
sailed away through the Golden Gate into history were envied by
their waiting comrades who stood long under arms and ready for
a further call. We saw those who sailed to the front go with ranks
full. We saw their commands return with gaps made by wounds
and fever-
No matter what may be thought of war, it is the last resort,
and when it comes pitiful is the nation that does not command the
patriotism of 'its people. It is the desire of California to encourage
the love of country by perpetuating the memory of heroic. men who
offer their lives in defense of national honor and the flag. To this
end a proper monument is about to be erected in this city in honor
of the California volunteers. It is the work of Douglas Tilden, the
native son and sculptor whose art has been before invoked to beau
tify the city. This monument is ready for emplacement and seeks
a site suitable to its dignity and purpose. It is to be. hoped that
the committee in charge and the proper public authority will soon
reach an agreement upon the location and that in due time we may
have the unveiling and dedication of this memorial to our patriotic
volunteers.

7HE MODERN MONTE CRIS TO: "TWO!"
ROOSEVELT AND THE BOY.
ONE boyâ one of many â who had- the
honor t>f meeting the President,
now acts as if Mr. Roosevelt's eyes
were constantly on him. Tills lad was
not a small boy when he was presented;
he was big enough to play baseball with
skill and energy, and on ordinary occa
sions he was a haughty sophomore. This
boy wanted to see the President, but his
outward calmness was disturbed by the
Intimation from his sisters that he would
have to make three bows as he ap
proached the President and say, "Your
Excellency." The courage that had stood
six hours' exposure in a heavy sea on the
keel of an upturned boat weakened be
fore this prospect. A benevolent friend
corrected the alarming suggestions of the
sisters by telling him that he would sim
ply be expected to say, "Mr. President,"
to stand until everybody was seated, and
to so when the President should rise.
This seemed easy: still, it was evident
that the fearless athlete was reverently
practicing "Mr. President" with his lips
as lie approached the White House. All
uneasiness disappeared, however, when
the President, catching sight of the boy.
Btepped forward and called him by his
surname. - fl Sit "down!- hesaid, and then
he began to talk about a subject dear to
the lad's heartâ the recent races at
Poughkeepsle. Etiquette was forgotten ;
the boy held fast to ."Mr. President,"
when he thought of it, in the delight of
talking with somebody who "really
knew" all about the ins and outs of In
tercollegiate races, but sometimes he for
got and merely said "you."
The boy was pained for a moment to
discover that the President could not play
baheball. To a near-sighted man who must
wear glasses a baseball flying at large
Is much worse than a bullet. The lad
cesses for thrones of either religion. No doubt it has hoped to do
this for Spain. King Alfonso is half Hapsburg, half Spanish. But
King Edward is believed to have outwitted the other matchmakers
by captivating Alfonso -with an English Princess.
In the time of Louis XIV the Spanish marriage brought on a
devastating war. It may do so again.: But, oddly enough, the ex
pectation of an Anglo-German war is based on a matter of royal eti
quette. The Kaiser is of the opinion that he was snubbed by his
uncle, King Edward, because Great Britain was not adequately rep
resented at the marriage of his son, and because his own wedding
anniversary was not sufficiently honored by the Court of St. James.
Outsiders will consider these to be light reasons for embroiling two
countries, in war, loading their people with debt and causing the
death of thousands and the distress of millions, who don't care a
bawbee whether the two royal families are on speaking and visiting
terms or not.. vVÂ« j/';-' :
It would seem that the Kaiser could get even by snubbing the
next royal anniversary or function in the court of his uncle, without
sending his army and navy out to try to play havoc with the army
and. navy of Great Britain. The warlike prospect is not pleasing to
the English people, who have appointed a sort of placating committee
to cultivate friendly relations with the Germans. They even propose
to ask President Roosevelt to try, his hand at appeasing the Kaiser.
This is a good idea. If the President could persuade the King and
the Kaiser to visit this country, meet in the White House and shake
hands, what" a fine bit of history/ it, would make t

admitted this, and said afterward that
"if Thackeray were alive and played
baseball .instead .of r cricket,- he . would
have had the same difficulty." The Presi
dent showed him a very; scientific Jiu
jitsu grip.. And this was followed by an
Interchange of lore on this \u25a0 interesting
Japanese solence of physical culture, rwith
illustrations, in which the boy entirely
forgot his fear of the "court presenta
tion" "and talked and acted with entire re
spect, but entire freedom. The boy seemed
to think that American muscle was a
match. for Oriental skill, but 'he was
plainly convinced that the President had
both. Questions of boxing and riding
came up, and the President spoke as an
expert, and the boy listened and talked
as one who. understood but felt his limi
tations. Young Theodore, who has this
year entered . Harvard, . was then at
school; but every' now and then his father
culled a bit from his son's experience in
out-of-door sport. It was .' plain that,
through sympathy, in these matters he
had the same point of view as his sons.
During ]' all. this interview the President
was -as enthusiastic on the various sub
jects discussed as the boy, and he seemed
to enjoy it as much as his boy,visitor did.
The talk drew out of the. President his
knowledge of the games that boys love.
"When it comes to boxing or riding,",
he said, with conviction. "I think that
my boys and I can hold our own.". And

"THE SPIRIT OF CHRISTMAS" is the
title that has elected a "modest little book
by Henry Van Dyke, professor of litera
ture in Princeton University, to be the
first mentioned in this page devoted to
books for Christmas gifts. Not that by
premier place I mean to say It is the
best: it would be alien to the temper of
the time and theme to make invidious
comparisons of this with other gifts that
multitudes of other electors will choose to
send, and I begin wiih this, one in hope
to hypnotize you by opening with the
words of the tltib into putting the spirit
of Christmas into whatsoever gift is sent
to relative, friend or loved one.
We all know It and the need of it,
of course, but to name It helps us to '
know it more and to be surer of not for
getting to breauie that mystic supervalue
charm into tha whatsoever of our send
ing by means of any secret, sacred in
cantation our faith or superstition has
found most potent in the past. A gift
l"(!s a right spirit breathed into it at
Â«ry time of giving, but a Christmas gift
that Is nothing but material, be even that
material all gold and pearl, seems like
a blasphemy of the name that super
latively Incarnated the spirit of the hap
pifst day of all the year.
The list of Christmas gift books is too
loos for any satisfactory investigation
save over the long tables and shelves of
the book stores, and the few here men
tioned are just vehicles to carry the idea
of the spirit of Christmas through the
rage. There are multitudes more to suit
varied tastes, and these limited mentions
may be only useful to such few persons
who In a book store are like the child in
a toy chop, where the bewildering
chance to choose paralyzes the power
of joyous selection and content obtain
ment. Happy are those who happen,
near Christmas time, to have read and
fallen In love with some particular
book which they can thus send to a
friend, assured that it is a personally
put to proof good thing which they
are by the gift sharing with one !
whom they wish also happy in Its de
lights: "a book to carecs â peculiar, dis- \u25a0
tlnctlve, individual ; a book that hath first
caught your eye and then pleased your
fancy; written by an author with a ten
der whim, all right out of his heart."
Blessed are ye who can so donate â pro
vided always the donee is a responsive
person; responsive to the soul that is al
ways half hidden in such a beautiful
bookâ of set purpose to keep phlegm from
enjoying the pearls of
*j- and feeling not made for pachy-
C^rrns who care naught for tender whims
were they ever so distinctive and indi
vidual.
The CbTietinas spirit Is to be In "the
giving vein"; and the true giving vein
is the spirit of Christ, who was willing
to himself infinitely. Of what
soever faith we may Individually be, we
must surely appreciate a beautiful tenet
of religion, albert not our own belief; and
<rie of the beautiful faiths of the Catholic
church is that Christ so loved the world
lie would have died for each separate In
dividual Elnner. That's a thought stag
gering to ingratitude were there but one
chance In a million that the tenet is
1 a*ed on truth.
In some sort of analogous sense, In
finitely less complete of course, we
finite* are to put the spirit of Christ
mas Into cur g-jfts by giving some
thing of ourselves. Emerson in defln
, ing how to be a friend Bald, "Be a gift
and a benediction." Of course that
thought involves the further one that
to be personally, by friendship, a gift
and a benediction worth the reception
needs infinite time in which to con
tinue growing worthy of the friend we
think worth the giving of any part of
the spirit of Christmas which may be
given us to give away.
Henry Van Dyke, who has here In
San Francisco given us proof of his
power to preach sermons worthy of a
professor of literature, calle one dlvl-
TÂ»-n of his little book "A Short Christ
â¢*tsr.:s Sermonâ Keeping Christmas." He
takes hjs text from Romans xiv:6: "He
that regardeth the day, reg-ardeth it
unto the Lord." A part of this Christ
mas keeping he holds to be that you
be willing "to ignore what the world
ewes you, and to think what you owe
the world." "â¢ â¢ to close your book
of complaint against the management
of the universe, and look around you
for a place where you can sow a few
seeds of happiness. â¢ â¢ â¢ then you
can keep Christmas. Are you willing
to stoop down and consider the needs
dZ little children; to remember the;
weakness and loneliness of people who
are growing old; to stop asking: how
much your friends love you. and ask
yourself whether you love them '
enough?" "-*'.* Are you willing to
believe that love is the strongest thing
in the world â¢ â¢ stronger than
death â and that the blessed life - which i
began in Bethlehem nineteen hundred
years ago Is the image and brightness
of the eternal love? Then you can
keep Christmas."
' Another part of his book is called "A
Little Essay: Christmas Giving and |
Ohrirtmas Living." In this he speaks of
the age-long habit of exchanging presents
on a certain day In the year as "a cheer
ful old custom, or a futile old farce, ac
cording to the sDlrlt which animates it
and the form which it takes." The idea
which the name Christmas has put. into
the tradition-old custom Is "an unselfish
Interest in the happiness of others." For
the most part Christmas giving "deals
*?|h little wants, little Joys. little tokens
of icendly feeling. But' the feeling must
be more than the token, else the gift
does not- really belong to Christmas."
"The finest Christmas gift Is not the one
that costs the most money, but the one
that carries the most love." "Let the yes-

sel be of gold or of birch bark. It may
carry ajnessagre like this: I am thinking
of you to-day because It is Christmas,
and I wish you happiness. And to-mor
row, because It will be the day after
Christmas, I shall still wish you hap
piness, and so on."
The first part of the book Is "a dream
story" called "The Christmas Angel."
Therein Van Dyke joyously abandons
himself .to the spirit of Christmas aa if
verily we had obeyed Christ's orders and
become as little children, and so he
writes to us fairy-tale-wise; but mingled
j with enougu. of the method of the Apo
calypse make us seriously feel as if
he were pulling the cover from divine
truth by embodying In a tale things un
tellable In the reality. The scene and
time of the story is "the hour of rest in
the Country Beyond the Stars."
"How," ask the angels of each other,
"how shall man be made liKe God?" The
query only caused a deep hush until a
child's vcice came ringing with the an
swer: "Clear and sweetâ clear as a ray
of light, sweeter than the smallest silver
bell that rang the hour of restâ was that
slender voice floating on the odorous and
translucent air. â¢ â¢ â¢ I know it, I know
it, I know It! Man shall *be made like
God because the son of God shall become
a man."
"But how do you know these things?"
cried the other -angels.
"I am the Christmas angel?" said the
child. "At first I was sent as the dream
of a little child, a holy child, bjessed and
wonderful, to dwell In the heart of our
virgin, Mary of Nazareth."
Although writing abstract from all sec
tarianism, as one surely should In pages
prejudiced against no creed, nor doubt,
nor disbelief, so long as these various
make their god equal to the highest ideal
they know, or knowing not God
make a god of high ideals, it
may yet be reasonable at a time
of .Christmas giving to give Christians
due precedence as the main makers of
merry Christmas. To give them first
place seems part of the spirit of Christ
mas. The keeping alive of that spirit is
partly their gift to the world. From a
literary point of view a very pleasing ex
pression of the quality of the true Chris
tian spirit Is In the following verse,
which, though not thus rendered in ajiy
of our versions of the Bible, I have, seen
pet down as being a literal translation. It
is beautiful, and in a variorum Bible that
verse should hold a place. For the way
of the wording of It appeals more to tlie
love of ' language than even the . excellent
eentence In the King James version. To
such of our Christian, friends as this form
of the sentiment may oe novel to let it
be given, In the name of the world ab
stract from sectarianism, as a tiny Christ
mas gift expressive of appreciation of the
true Christian and Christmas- spirit in
books and In life:

New Fairy -Tale
in Clever Form
There are othersâ perhaps, but . if
asked on my conscience as a reviewer in
regard to the season's fresh fairy stories
I would feel inclined to answer the query
by saying that "Queen Zixi of Ix" Is IT.
If any grown-up person wants a delight
ful change off from " reading all' adult
stuff let him or her be a child again for
the nonce and revel and grow wise over
the nonsense of this new work of L.
Frank Baum, the author of the cele
brated "Wizard of, Oz," which scored
successes both in book form and on the
stage. Then having thus improved your
self you will know what'to give to a
good childâ or to a bad one -whom you
wish magically to transform into a quite
sanely happy and obedient \ changeling
sent from fairy land. It has wonderful
pictures by Frederick Richardson. The
text and the illustrations' mutually as-
Blst each other so magically that .the to
tal effect may fairly be said to be wizard
wand business. ,
The secondary title is "The Story of the
Magic Cloak." That cloak had the power
and the wlll r to grant its wearer ono
wish, and only one.- If you wish for an
hour or two to enter fairyland, al
though you may not. In reality wear 4he
cloak that could grant the wish, if you
merely Imagine the magic consumma
tion and open up the book in the right
spirit of willingness to accept transport,
then, 10, you will be* there. ' The magic
cloak was woven In the fairy circle of
Burzec, at the command of the fairy
queen, Lulea. Her Majesty did this.be
cause of the- suggestion jof .the sweet
little fairy, Espa. It was Espa's love of
unhappy mortals and her wish to make
them happy which moved her heart to
the proposal upon which the fairy queen
and all the maidens of her 1 court acted.
The fairy band did the' â¢ work as a
pastimeâ a delightful, novel amusement.
They wove the lovely fabric from a loom
such as no mortals. ever 1 use. Each fairy
carried In her â¢ hand a shuttle "wound
with' glossy filaments finer than the finest
silk; and the threads on. each shuttle ap
peared a different hue from those of all
the other shuttles." Then > they ;: danced
around the. loom and . flung, the silver
shuttles from hand to hand : and the gos
samer-lfke web began rto t grow . into , a
cloth of wondrous beauty. _i In - the joyous
work the - Queen herself ~~ took ?\u25a0 part I and
wove into "the * fabric '; the . golden \u25a0 thread
wHlch gave the j cloak i Its magic \u25a0 powers.
This ' beautiful scene ils 'pictured 'in 'the
frontispiece,"' showing the ;woodlahd moon
lit ana the flower "strewn sward,â¢ and'; the
white wings of -the' fairies and their white
arms gracefully weaving the magic web
as all the while they So, sud
denly, just by thinking of the lovely
scene, you are in the transport by which
fairyland Is fully reached.
Many were the wishes, some wise, some
foolish, which the cloak granted 'to Its
various mortal wearers. It is the wish
of Queen Zixl of Ix that the tale is
chiefly about; though hers was not the
wisest wish. She was a witch queen
who- had. kept herself healthy and beau
tiful for. over six hundred years. She
lacks but one specially longed for blissâ
a mirror in which she could see that ap
parently youthful beauty In which she
appeared to the eyes of all other mortals
except herself, To her own eyes the
mirrors always showed her an ugly,
shriveled old hag which the hundreds of
years had* wrinkled. So when she heard
of the magic cloak she wished to get it
from Its rightful owner, the Princess
Fluff, to whom the loving fairy, : Ereol,
had/presented It. It was the minstrel,
Quavo, who told his admired Queen Zixi
about the power of the beautiful garment.
The cloak belongs to Princess Fluff, ;
"Tia woven of some secret stuff,
Which makes it gleam with splendor bright.
That fills beholders with delight
Queen Zixi. although a : witch, was a
kindly Queen, and her- only unhappine3s
was the fate of havin* to behold her own
ugliness whenever she looked Into a mir
ror. When she heard of the cloak she
coveted it. If she could possess it she
would wish to see no more the provoking
reflection of the face of an ugly old wo
man. She tried strategy, and went dis'
guised to the realm of the Princess Fluff
and' advertised thus: "Miss Trust's Acad
emy of Witchery for Young Ladles." -The
scheme nearly worked; but when she
asked the rr p 4 splls to come on a certain day
each wearing her handsomest cloak, the
Princess got wise and suspicious. 'After
many futile other endeavors Zlxl resorted
to theft? to obtain j the coveted cloak.
Then, madly rejoicing and arrayed in
all the glory of the stolen treasure, she
rushed to the clear cp'stal spring in the
woodland, ,â- so that .she -might see her
beauty in -that mirror.

Christmas Books
For All Readers
In selecting a good story book to give
to the children at Christmas time do not
deny to "The Story* of the Bible," by
Margaret E. Sangster, a chance In the
competition. Of course you know if she
undertook such a task she would do It
well. Mrs. Sangster is said to have long
contemplated such an appeal to children
as part of her life work. The design
was to bring the entire Scripture within
the. compass of a child's interest and'
patience and to tell again the tales from
Holy Writ so that our children may read
and love them. The book has fulfilled
a double duty; one to religion and one to
literature. The author, who knows well
whereof she speaks, says that it is a
mistake to fancy that children do w not
enjoy good literature. "The child de
lights in brave deeds, >in romance, in
chivalry, in splendid diction and poetic
style." If is quite "a large book, of about
five hundred pages. It Is dedicated to
Helen Gould, which is quite a triumph
worthy tribute to "one whose unobtru
sive goodness strews flowers on many
paths." Let us glance within its page 3
here and there and see how Mrs. Sang
ster does things.
In the story of .creation she tells the
children that where this planet on which
now we live goes round the great sun
there was only vast empty space, or
perhaps "a great lonesome mist, called
chaos, all strange, confused and dim.
Out of this chaos, God created the heav.en.v
and the earth, n To- ereat^ is to^'^ake;
something and put it-where there used to
be nothing. Only God can do this. â¢ * â¢
He spoke one word, gave one command,
and the darkness lifted like a curtain that
Is rolled up and disappears, lie said let
there be light and there was light." \u25a0
This from the chapter called "The Lad
der to the Sky": "Jacob gathered some
loose stones that were lying about on the
road and took them for his pillow and
lay down and fell asleep.* â¢ â¢ In that
sleep, dear children, Jacob had the love
liest dream ever given to -mortal man.
He dreamed that he saw a ladder which
reached from earth to heaven; the lad
der's foot was on the ground, but the top
was lost beyond the sky; and behold!
the angels of God were ascending and
descending upon it."
From the story of Samson this: "We
are to obey God in what we fancy little
â¢ things.' We are to choose good com
panions, not ,bad ones. If sin gets hold
of us it will treat us as the Philistines
treated Samson. First It will blind our
eyes and we shall not see how" horrid It
is. Then it will bind us in fetters of evil
habits and take our strength away. Then
it will make us serve like slaves In a
prison house." â¢ ;
The truly dtscrlmlnatjng will be much
pleased with this from the story of Queen
Esther. The undiscrimlnatlng always
lavish their main, admiration on Esther
and ignore the merits of Vashti, over
whose modesty. Esther's boldness gained
what, when you conscientiously analyze
It, Is rather an ignoble victory of a wo
man who was willing to take' desperate
risks of being something much less than
a wife. Would to heaven we had Vash
tl's own version of that little affair of
feminine rivalry which has been told as
an Idyl by the partisans of Esther. Mrs.
Sangster says: "I have always felt very
sorry for Vashti and have much respect
for her. She was a treat lady, who had
courage beyond that- of most women of
her time."
This is. from the "Wonderful Deeds of
Jesus": "The Christ child coming to earth
when the angels sang in the midnight
and the Star in the East guided the pil
grims to the manger was wonderful be
yond words. But yet more wonderful
were the deeds of love and kindness that
kept springing up like flowers In his earth
ly path, after he began to teach and
preach In the holy land."
* The volume has twelve illustrations of
Bible scenes in color.

"The Poet, Miss Kate and I" Is an at
tractive title that appeals, through one's
intuitions, at once, but you can't help
wondering why the third party Isn't "de
trop"â and then you wonder which of the
trio* is the third party. So. although the
back is very pretty and dilatorily tempt
ing td look at, it is best to break into the
book promptly and . find out what it' 3
about. . The third party, to wit. Miss I
Kate, is a horse, so that eliminates one
uneasiness from anticipation. Next we
want to know if the sex of the other two
can pair off properly. They do. The poet
is a fine' man, and the "I," the teller of
the tale, is Dorothyâ Miss Dorothy. So
that will do, and we can settle back pa
tiently and read on hopefully, awaiting
developments between the poet and Do- j
The author, who is Margaret P. Mon
tague,* writes for all the world like a good
and gayly correspondent who has millions
of bright f moments : and billions of affec
tion to spend in writing chatty letters to
you. Kate is a pet saddle mare that Do
rothy rides six miles to the postofflce
every day through so picturesque a bit of
country that the beauty of it makes her
a prose poet air unconscious to herself
and by so much a prettier so. So goes a
summer, smiling with all the beauties , of
nature aspread around Miss Dorothy as
she daily rides and adores the wonders of
the wood, and the glory of the sky, and
the balmy kisses of the air. >.Is that air
the kisses she ever got, we wonder?. Let's
hurry away over toward the end and find
out:
â¢ â¢ â¢ "Dorothy, ' why. Dorothy!" the
poet -exclaimed,: with a world of tender
ness in' his* voice.. _ '
I said nothing, but slipped off Miss Kate
beside, him. , \u25a0\u25a0"\u25a0:â¢\u25a0>'\u25a0 S. . v . . "â¢*
'.'But who was hurt?" I asked, after a
long-time. \u25a0
"Only three people, none badly. You
must have heard a very exaggerated ac
count of the whole thing." said the poet.

Do not ever go downtown shopping
with any despair In your heart about
finding a nice, seasonable gift book so
long as you can remember that there is
such a one called "Romances of Old
France," by Richard Le Galllenne. Re
member in your quest that Le Gallienne
was the fellow who wrote "The Quest of
the Golden Girl," and then you will be
quite sure you are going after a good
thing. It is a book which will attract
the eye from the outside and satisfy It
when it tests the Inside. Decorated pages,
pleasing type, eloquent words, and, if the
double trope be allowed, both ringing and
redolent of romance.
Among the six of these romances of old
France the chief one is of Aucassln and
Nicolete, the old classic that has been
rescued from half oblivion to be now
very much alive in French and in world
literature. I will only hwe space to give
you a glimpse. The course of true love is,
of course, not going smooth for Aucassin;
but his Nicolete loves as warm as he.
She steals in the moonlight to the ruin
ous tower where her lover lies, and she
hears him "wailing within and making
i dole and lament for the sweet lady he
â¢ loves so well." Now behold what she
looked like as she went! She had kilted up
her kjrtle, "because of the dew that she
saw lying deep on the grass."
""â¢ "Her locks were yellow and curled,
her eyes blue and smiling, her face featly
fashioned, the nose high and fairly set,
the lips more red than cherry or rose In
time of summer, her teeth white and
small; her breasts so firm that they bore
up the folds of her bodice as they had
been two apples; so slim she was In the
waist that your two hands might have
clipped her, and the daisy flowers that
broke beneath her as she. went tiptoe and
that bent above her instep seemed black
against- her feet, so- white was the
maiden.'*
And here's a part where the story goes
too troubadour to hold Itself from burst
ing into song:
Sweet the sons, the story sweet.
There Is no man hearkens it.
No man living 'neath theÂ«sun
" So outwearitd, so foredone,
' Sick and woful, worn ana sad.
But Is healed, but is glad.
'Tis so sweet.

York: $1 50.)
If you carry a pencil wherewith you
can red letter your note book about
some simple and inexpensive but at
the same time elegant and artistic
Christmas gifts then be sure to so ru
bric the "Red Letter Library" prepared
by H. M. Caldwell & Co. of Xew York
and Boston. There is a long list of
choice literature in these tittle vol
umes, beautifully bound in either cloth
or fine red leather at 50 cents or one
dollar. The idea is to present the mas
terpieces of the English language in
the most artistic form at a moderate
price. .These have short introductory
notes, well called "cameos of apprecia
tion." -The range is now extending be
yond English literature to masterpieces
of other tongues. The ones that I
have by me are "L'Arlesienne" (the girl
of Aries) by Alphonse Daudet, and the
"Poems" (selected) by John Greenleaf
Whittier. They are very attractive with
their ' flexible backs, neat print and

Paul Elder & Co. have prepared
for Christmas and New Year's day
gifts a number of beautiful calendars
and Christmas cards and book marks
ranging in price from ten cents to a
dollar. The calendars have very good
selections from the words of great men
to keep before us for each month in the
year. There is a calendar of nature
songs, an impression calendar, and a
miniature calendar of homely maxims.
Best of all of these I like the aspira
tions calendar. It begins with this
from Robert Louis Stevenson: t
"So long as we love we serve; so long
as we are loved by others I would al
most say that we are indispensable; and
no man is useless while he has a
friend." . 'â¢
(Paul Elder & Co.. Sen Francisco.)
No one would have suspected Max Nor
dau of writing fairy tales, for one would
think that to that stern philosopher such
work would seem a . trifling sentimental
thing suitable to an artistic temperament
that by its very genius for imaginative
creation proved itself at least tending
toward "degeneration." Nevertheless,
Nordau has done it; and if to be play
fully, trivially fanciful, even to be
chummy with the little children, is to
be tainted with the degeneration that
causes genius, then Nordau la himself
in that semi-insane class which he ap
peared to believe are alone capable of
doing anything other than- most matter
of-fact and prosy performance. His
book is called "The Dwarf Spectacles and
Other Fairy. Stories," and they were first
told to his own little Maxa. from her
fourth Ito j her seventh, birthday. So that
sounds 'very HkÂ© the real thing in fairy
stories. Done by a learned and â¢ very
clever man in his hours of leisure, and
done out ' of love for an actual close-to
hls-heart little girl; and this last is of
course always more. lnspiring than if the
telling was for .the Indefinite, distant pub
lic : or , other ,' people's little girls.-
It 'is a large book, well Illustrated, and
contains twenty-one stories. The last" one
in it is' called "Life and Death." In Its
final sentence,- speaking of the brief but
bright ' and happy life of swarms of
ephemerae. H teaches the little children
philosophy thus: -"
: "When their little bodies covered the
surface of the stream the wise raven said
to i the . mountain, the oak and the gen
tian: 'A long. life; a short life, matters
nothing. A beautiful life, that Is happi-
ness.' "

Esther Singleton, who is quite an ex-
pert in the art of compiling, has got to
gether a collection of stories from many
, languages, called 'The Wild Flower
Fairy Book." It is very handsome, with
a number of colored pictures, and all its
pages decorated.
One of these stories is about "The
Brave Tin Soldier." There were twenty
five tin soldiers once, who were all broth
ers, for they were all made out of the
same tin spoon. They were given to a lit
tle boy for a birthday present, and he
stood at the table and set them up. They
were all alike, except one, and he had
only one leg. He was the one who had
been left to the last, and then there was
not enough melted tin to finish him. so
they made him stand on one leg. and this
caused him to be very remarkable.
One day he fell out of a window, but
he was too proud to cry out for help whilo
he was in uniform. He went through
many adventures, always bearing himself
with the like silent courage. When he
was put in the fire and he felt himself
melting away, he still remained firm with
his run held to his shoulder. There is a
love story mixed up with it which some
what mitigates the awfulness of his fate.

"Animal Heroes," by Ernest Thompson
Seton, is a handsomely gotten up book,
with over 200 drawings. This work of the
noted teller of animal stories will no
doubt please the boys very much, as the
author has proved himself so successful
In that t llne by many previous books.
Some of' the stories in the new volume
have before appeared in magazines and
other periodicals. The word hero as here
used is defined to mean an individual of
unusual gifts and achievements, whether
man or animal. Every one of the stories
is founded on the actual life of a veritable
animal hero. Most of the tales are com
posites, but one of them, "Arnaux," is
very nearly historical.
: Arnaux is the chronicle of a homing
pigeon. Birds of this type are not bred
for style, but for speed and for their
mental qualities. Arnaux was put to a
severe teat in his early youth in order
that the slow or stupid birds ameng
whom he waÂ» tried might be weeded out.
At three months old he was a winner,
and was invested with the silver anklet
of the Sacred Order of the High Homer.
One of his exploits was to bear a message
from a ship out at sea, which had broken
its shaft and was drifting helplessly.

Infantry.' Why it was not sent in will
have to be explained in almost satis
factory manner by the commanding of
ficer. This* is the first time in 'many
years that practically all reports have
been sent in on time.
" General Koster, in speaking on this
subject a few days since, said that of
ficers whose duty it is to send In re
ports "must have them in on time or
suffer, the consequences."

CONSIDERING WORK.
\u25a0 The meeting was for the purpose of
considering what shall be done during
the coming year with a view to in
creasing the efficiency of the- regiment
as a whole and the companies as indi
vidual organizations/. The regimental
c6mmahder~"presidedTand after calling
the assemblage to order, the three ma
jors in the order of seniority gave an
account of the condition of the batta
lions under their respective command
and also offered suggestions.
One suggestion was that the field of
ficers should meet at stated periods
for the purpose of comparing notes,
with the idea of doing the work in
each battalion along -exactly the same
lines.
Target practice was discussed and
the opinion was that more attention
should be paid to it, so tljat there shall
be better marksmanship. Majors Smith
and Haven reported that they had suit
able ranges for the companies of their
respective battalions, while Major
Hunt stated that he had discovered an
ideal site for a range and that an effort
will be made .to secure it for the use
of Companies A. F arid G.
The subject of indoor and outdoor
drill, practice marches arid the like,
was fully discussed and attention was
called to" orders of Brigadier General
Koster, commanding the Second Bri
gade, ln regard to promptness in the
matter of transmitting reports and re
turns through the proper channels.
It was also decided that there
should be a meeting of the regimental
and company officers once in three
months for the Â«ood of the service.
After the meeting was declared
closed, all adjourned to a rotisserie to
enjoy a Sunday dinner."
SIGNAL WORK PRACTICE.
It is said that the Signal Corps of
the Second Hrigade will put on "a
spurt" during the coming . year, and
early in the season will move in the
line of progression. It lg contemplated
there will be practical and long-dis
tance signaling by rides, to (suburban
points, and that during the year the
men of this organization will endeavor
to make a record Jrf reading correctly
cipher letters sent by wand inside of
four minutes; redding correctly all nu
merals sent by wand inside of thirty
seconds; memorizing all abbreviations
and conventional' signals as ltiicl down
on the card; sending. correctly twenty
five cipher letters and five fronts with
four-foot flags, letter being called, to
send, inside of one minute; heliograph
ing ,with single and double mirror,
demonstrating ability to set up both
and to correctly send and receive mes
sages and satisfactorily climbing and
descending , thirty-foot pole with
'climbers."' This- is on the plan of
what is .done in other States and It
Is believecl that it\ will bring the men
of the corps into a lineof practice with
which they should be thoroughly fami
liar. It is alsoexpected that the men
will be instructed in every known
method of sound or visual means 'of
communication from old "style "wig
wag" signaling to; wireless telegraph
ing. \ .
CAVALRY TROPP I3IPROVING.
There is considerable activity In Troop
A, cavalry, Captain Grenniger command
ing. The new captain has done well in
recruiting and he has done much in- the
matter of having the , men of his com
mand pay strict attention to the duties
expected of them.' . > * \u25a0â¢- X :
There are many men in. the First'lnfan
try \who " say that battalion '\u25a0 drill in the
armory ought; to be followed by a social
hour. 1 They are 'of the \u25a0 opinion that at
battalion drills / in the armory the I regi
mental band* should be on hand, â¢ and
after drill should play dance music -for
the men who have drilled and for their
gentlemen and I lady i friends, who should
be invited to witness the work of the sol
diers. They, believe that by such a course
more interest in the_ citizen soldiery would
be created : and the community would
know more of the guard and what it does.

pear whenever needed to testify In the
case of the Government against Con
gressman Blnger Hermann, who is under
indictment in connection with the opera
tions of the land fraud ring in this State.
The local sureties for the pair assert
that they were relieved of responsibility
for the appearance of the men by Francis
J. Heney, who was United States Attor
ney during the land fraud trials in Ore

of the United States District Court fail
to reveal that new bondsmen were se
cured.

LONDON AROUSED
AT CAR SERVICE
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, Dec. : 16.â "Yerkes* strap
hangers," â¢as the discontented : travelers
on the Americanized Underground Rail-,
way have â¢ been nicknamed, ': certainly
mean business. They have; registered
their objection"; to ' overcrowd"ing in the
cars, as. all the world, knows; but just
how they are going. to make' it-count has,
up to this time, been â¢ a matter of con
jecture. ; . '
. However, in "the \u25a0 course" of .an inter
view which .; obtained - to-day * with the
representative of one of ; the. largest
"straphanger associations" in London,
the steps which the public intends to take
in '- the matter. ; were made quite clear.
F. W. Galton, secretary of the "London
Reform Union, .which : has taken jup the
fight in the interests of travelers, when
asked' what; they were going to do about
it, said: , " \u25a0:
.. "There have alreauy been- organized In
London "â¢ no ,.'. less than Â§ three jj societies lof
'strapnangers,* whose sole purpose' is to
make tne railway: management stop over
crowding. Two ; firms ;of - lawyers . have
taken up the cudgels'on behaÂ« of a' num
ber of grieved 'straphangers,' r while >the
Society of Travelers ; and" our > association;
the London Reform , Union; are. out gun
ning for , the railways with similar, objects.
"Hundreds of letters have ; been
to \utf ,, denouncing \ the*' use of /American
crushing -on" the.^underground â¢ railways.
We | have | formally \ drawn : up these; let
ters and presented "them \ to" the ' Board of
Trade,; which Has control of ; all fpassenger
traffic In England, 1 and that ibody^has 'sent
a petition *;to the < railway /companies, Vde-
manding an abatement of the nuisance."
"What time do you consider traffic to
be most congested ?'' was asked.
APPEAL TO TRADE BOARD.
"The; most 'overcrowded', moment, in
London,"- said Galton, "has been offi
cially ascertained to f be 7:15 p. m. It
seems" at this time the whole town is
on the move and the railway companies
point, out that, if everybody Insists on
going 5 home at one moment,
there fmust * be; overcrowding In the na
ture; of things. .While we admit -this, we
demand . more \u25a0 cars; ' and the chances 'are
; we :.;wlll'i get them' or. know the . reason
iWhy. V . ,; District '; railway , officials ' have
promised *to ] do better for the public,, but
we- do not .believe j railway . promises, and
arej getting/ ready /our legal machinery."
; "But. suppose the appeal by the ; Board
of ' Trade be ignored?;' was .suggested:
"what then?"
,"< "If;' the appeal to-.: the ''Board o^ Trade
does^ not; result . in . an I ' immediate better
ment : i of ;; the - : service, ' so ;: that \ every/ one,
or nearly every one, \u25a0\u25a0 will have i- : a seat,! a
number of 'rest cases' will be brought in
the special court for hearing, these cases,
known as the Court of Railway and Canal
Commissions, presided over by Lord Cob
ham: and: Sir Frederick Peel, each draw
ing $10,000 a year, and a special Judge,
with a salary of $25,000 per annum. The
peculiarity of this court is that even if
the passenger wins he must pay his own
costs, which , often run into some thou
sands, of dollars. It Is for the very pur
pose ;of 'enabling â¢ aggrieved travelers to
meet these" costs that organized associa
tions have entered the contest. .
CAnY XOT SATISFACTORY.
."Funds ,wlll be raised to fight for the
unseated -public; which Intends to" sit
down if it costs them JIOOO a seat.
If the railway company by any technical
ity .wins Its * case, then the \u25a0 representa
tives of. the straphangers may bring in a
bill to' Parliament and ,a..big agitation,
with : the appointment of a, possible royal
commission, :will . keep : the matter before
the public, and some thing, will have to
nappen. â¢ .
"One" thine is very evident," continued
the Secretary. "London 'straphangers' do
not intend to sit quietly, or, rather,
stand, and let the railway companies
crowd them as they please, as is done in
America. If the Brooklyn bridge cni3h
took place in London' the public would
simply not stand for it.'*
"As a matter of fact, there has been so
much furor created over the methods
brought Into play s*lnce the introduction
of ths American system, as operated on*
the new electric underground railway
that many serious doubts have arisen as
to the utility of American cars on this
service.^ Roughly speaking, not less than
2.000,000 people pour Into and out of Lon
don at the rush hours, from Â« to 3 a. m.
and from 5 to 7:30 p. m.. and 'many 'per-'t
sons are asking the question whether or4
not the English car is not more suitable^*
than the American for rapidity in eet '
ting into and out of trains. English cars
open by many doors on; each side, and
one set of persons can be g%tUn S out and

"Lucky" Baldwin, who was present to
see his pet perform, and Owner Fer

make for their horses. Each had shown
that he could travel fast in juicy going,
but the bookmakers thought the ad

Jake Holtman sent them away noses

by nearly three lengths. This did not

FIELD TRIALS
ARE PROMISING
Great Sport Expected When
Pointers and ' Setters Meet
in Contest at Bakersfield
The forthcoming twenty-third annual
trials of the Pacific Coast Field Trials
Club at Bakersfield. commencing on Jan
uary S, promise great sport. The various
stakes have filled well and the quail are
reported numerous.
Some changes have been made in the
rules governing the Members' Stake,
which are expected to add much to the
success of the meeting. The Members'
Stake willgfio run the first day and no
dog will be eligible which has been placed
in any trials other than in the Members'
Stake of the club. No dog will be al
lowed to compete which will be a starter
In any open* stake of the pending meeting.
These new conditions are expected to
limit the competition to the dogs the
members use in their private shooting,
which is the purpose of tne stake. It is
considered desirable to run it on the first
day, when the members will be keen for
sport afield. The events' will bo run in
the following order: Members' Stake,
Derby Stake. All Age Stake and Cham
pionship Stake.
W. J. Baughn of Ridgeville. Ind., who
will judge the sport, is a veteran field
trials official. He declined a number of
invitations to act in the saddle this year,
but he could not resist the Invitation bid
ding him come to California. On the night
before the trials open two gentlemen will
be chosen to ' assist Judge Baughn.
Babcock, Lucas, Coutts, Dodge, Dormer
and other handlers are on the ground
with big strings of setters and pointers.
Conditions for training are reported . fa
vorabic. Quail are more numerous than
for many years. The grounds over which
the trials will be run have been carefully
patrolled for some months and the birds
are not disturbed.
The prize cups and trophies are unusual
ly artistic and valuable this year. This
hardly interests the thorough sportsmen
whose dogs may be competing, as such
material things as prizes are apparently
never thought of and certainly they aTe
never discussed.
Concert in the Park.
The following programme will be
given in Golden Gate Park to-day:
â¢'Star-Spangled Banner," etc.; march,
"California Commandery." Alfred A.
Batkin; overture. "Peter Schmoll,"
Weber; waltz, "Dream on the Ocean,"
Gungl; solo for saxophone, selected
<J. L. Mundwyler);; grand fantasia,
"Nabucco," Verdi; overture, "Mignp'n,"
Thomas; serenade for flute and horn,
Titl; gems from Offenbach's operas,
Meyrelles; "A Cavalry Charge," Luders;
Priest's war march from "Athalie,"
Mendelssohn.
marked that Bearcatcher could gallop
faster than Handzarra could run.
Tommy Griffin, one of the most wide
ly known owners in the business, mixed
with the paddock crowd yesterday.
Lloyd Fountain was kept out of the
saddle owing to illness.
Tommy Clark, the rider of Nealon,
lodged a claim of foul against Treubel.
The judges did not think a palpable
foul had been committed and It was
not allowed.
"Boots" Durnell will ship his horses
down to Los Angeles this evening, after
winning two purses.

TENNIS EXPERTS
IN TEST MATCH
California Club Invites the
Best Eleven Players to
Compete on 'Its Courts
VICTOR WILL BE STAR
Park Contingent Picks Foley
as tjie Man Likely to
Be the Ultimate Winner
A number of tennis tournaments will
be played on the courts In the next three
weeks. The one that is attracting the
most attention is the invitation scratch
singles event scheduled for the Califor
nia Club on the 31st inst. The tourna
ment will be commenced on that date, but
as it is to be a round robin with eleven
contestants itwilltake four or five days
of actual ! play to complete.
The tournament committee has decided
to invite the following players to partici
pate: George Jones, Fred Adams, Charles
Foley, Percy Murdock, Melville Long,
Herbert Schmidt, Harry Rolfe, Clarence
Griffin, George Baker. Herbert Long and
George Busch. These players are un
questionably the best in the game at the
present time and the affair will settle
beyond a doubt which player of the
eleven is -the beat for 1905. Janes, as
coast champion, is entitled to first place
and will receive such ranking in the
guide. Whether Janes is the best player
in the city is a question that only an
event of this kind can settle.
Janes has been beaten three times since
he won the championship, and few look
upon him as the most skillful player in
the city. The champion will have an op
portunity to prove what the title implies,
and he will try his'hardest to retrieve his
lost laurels. Janes has nothing to lose
and everything to win, which is rather a
unique position for a coast champion.
The park contingent to a man picks
Foley to win the coming event. The pub
lic court champion unquestionably has as
good a chance to win as any othec en
trant, but he will have no easy time do
ing so. Percy Murdock. the Alameda
crack, who has had. a disastrous year,
looks to be Foley's most formidable rival.
"When they - met last Foley won quite
handily.
Aside from the two players just men
tioned Griffin, M. Long, Janes and Adama
appear to have ; the best chance .to win.
Griffin is a clever youngster, with an
abundance of grit and self-confidence,
arid- it would not be much of a surprise
If he carried off the honors. Young Long
has done, all .that has been asked of him
in the last two months, and that handily.
His' easy victory over :the coast cham
pion â¢ two weeks ago I entitles \u25a0 him to con
sideration. ; ,
i Janes rand Adams, /respectively coast
and .State champions, earlier In the year
looked 'to be the ; best \u25a0 players in this
'blue ribbon* of the, coursing world is
worth, "if not his weight in gold, at least
very near It,: when' more than $5000 has
been paid for a champion, and when his
stake,^winnings; have more - than once
passed the $5000 mark during: his coursing
career." '
â¢ This - article - should . prove ; Interesting
reading to the coursing officials on this
coast 'who 'are "charged with- keeping the
'sport 'Â» honorable i and on a high plane.
Some . day they will realize that running
it 1 year,, in, . year \u25a0 out, without giving its
followers jar breathing spell, 13 not th^
wteest \u25a0. policy.
MANY EVENTS
FOR GOLFERS
Schedule of Women's Annex
Includes Three Competi
tions for Council's Cup
FORTY DATS OF PLAY
3len to Compete in Handi
cap Contests on Christmas
and First of New. Year
Although no announcements have
been made as yet. it is probabla that
handicap golf tournaments will be held
on the courses of the San Francisco
Golf and Country Club, the Claremont
Country Club and the San Rafael Golf
Club on Christmas * day. As members
desire to get away from the clubhouse
in good time for their Christmas din
ners, these events are usually over
eighteen holes, with prizes for best
gross and net scores.
No more regular tournaments are
scheduled for the women's annex of
the San Francisco Golf and Country
Club during the present year, but
Thursday, the 21st inst., and Thursday,
the 28th inst., will be club days, on
which foursomes or team matches will
be held. It is likely, however, that
the 21st will be too near Christmas for
many ladies to go out to the links.
For the first four months of next
year many events are scheduled for
the women. There will be three com
petitions for the Council's Cup for
women, each of which contests occu
pies three or four days. The nrst be
gins on Tuesday, January 2. and ends
on the sth of the month, ThÂ« second
competition is set down to* begin on
Tuesday. February 27, and end on Fri
day. March 2. The third is arranged
to begin on Tuesday, April 10, and be
completed en Friday, April 13. There
will be two more competitions for the
Chesebrough cup, the first- beginning on
Tuesday, January 30. and ending on
Friday, February 2, and the second
opening on Tuesday. March 27. and
closing on Friday. . March 30. Thesa
five competitions provide twenty days
of play If the qualifying- rounds, medal
score, are held, or, if these, accordins
to the custom of the ladies, are drop
ped, there will be fifteen days of play.'
The schedule further provides for con
tests in driving, approaching and put
ting, two handicaps over eighteen
holes, medal play, and an eighteen
hole handicap play against bogey.
Kvery Thursday on which no regular
tournaments are being held is a club
day. In addition to all these events,
the first annual tournament of the Cal
ifornia Women Golfers' Association will
be- held in the fourth week of Janu
ary, from the 22d to the 27th inclu
sive.
The second eighteen holes of the.
36-hole home and home match between
teams representing the Burlingame
Country Club and the Menlo Golf and
Country Club were to have been played
on the Fair Oaks course on Sunday,
the 3d inst.. but were postponed on ac
count of the funeral of Mrs. Francist
Burton Harrison at San Mateo on that
day. The second half of the contest
will be held on some convenient day
early in the new year.
Most golfers are worried by a stymie,
especially if It occurs near the hole, aa
they find it hard to get enough loft to
clear the other ball and yet stop thÂ«
run of the ball as soon as necessary,
so as to let It fall into the cup. An
English player shows how a ball may
be lofted sufficiently Into the hole over
an intervening- ball. Where the player
does not want a long run. or desires
a sudden rise of the ball, the idea is tr>
force the club between the ball and tho
green, scarcely lifting the club from
the ground and almost brushing It as it
is taken back In a perfectly straight
line from the hole. Neither before nor
after hitting the ball is the club at any
appreciable distance .from the ground.
The secret of the stroke is that th*re
must be no endeavor either to hit the
ball or to take turf. The stroke is
played by trying to separate them
sharply by hitting In between them,
and the club must be kept as close as
possible to the ground from the be
ginning to the end of the stroke.

Chief Dinan was notified yesterday
by Governor Pardee that he had re

- Rolf a and "Schmidt are playing better
tennis than ever before and have a good
chance against r any of the players en

BRUGERE WINS
MANY ADMIRERS
Arrest of Military Command
er of French Army Causes
a^ Big Sensation , in Paris
HIS COURSE INDORSED
People Believe He Was Jus
tified in Refusing to Sa
lute an Inferior Officer
Special Dlxpatch to Tbe Call.
PARIS, Dec 16.â General Brugere, com
mander-in-chief of the French army, who
was arrested for a difference with a sub
ordinate who went scot-free, has Just
completed his sentence of imprisonment.
Brug^re's prominent position and his
past record make the peculiar situation
all the more remarkable. He has won
bis place at the head of the French army
not through political pull, but by his rec
ord as an officer. During the Franco-
Prussian war General Brugere was pro
moted for his masterly grasp of artillery
tactics, which won a number of impor
tant victories for the French. He was
made captain and major in the same
year, and rose rapidly from one. rank to
another. He attended the same school as
the la.te President Cfixnot, and they were
intimate personal friends. When Carnot
became President Brugere was appointed
chief of his household military staff.
General Brurere was born In 1841, and,
as he will be 65 years old next year, he'
will go on the retired list.
When the scandals about spying. on pri
vate political and religious convictions of
army officers began under General Andre
as Minister of War it was found that
Andre's right hand man at the Ministry.
General Percin, was responsible for the
active part of the work ordered by the
Minister. When Andre fell Percin
was wisely removed from the Min
istry, although retained at \u25a0 the head
of an army division. No love was lost
between him and his brother officers,
however, and numerous snubs have been
lavished upon him ever since. Finally,
some days ago. he got tired of this atti
tude; and unfortunately, he selected the
commander-in-chief of the army from
whom to demand cordial recognition.
TRIES TO AVOID PERCER.
General Brugere had carefully ab
stained from any comment on the Andre-
Percin incidents, and had observed the
regulation relations with his subordinate.
General Percin: but he made no secret
of the fact that the more completely he
could avoid Percin when off duty the
more agreeable it would be to him. Sus
pecting this, Percin rode out to the Bois
de Boulogne at the hour when General
Brugere usually took his morning ride,
and tried to cross him. Brugere, how-
ever, pretended to take quite accidentally
i to a bypath. Percin then spurred up to
i the generalissimo and said. "General,, I
Saluted and you did not answer.*,' .: "I
didn't see you." replied Brugere. "You
see me now," retorted Percin, "Well, it's
as if I didn't see you," said Brugere, rid
ing away. Percin then wrote to the Min
ister of War, complaining of the Incident,
and asking either that the Minister de
mand reparation or else authorize him
(Percin) to challenge his superior officer.
General Brugere. , V" â¢
But while tlie letter was going through
the post a change had come about in the
Ministry; Maurice Berteaux. the Socialist
Minister of War in sympathy with the
spying business, had fallen and was re
placed by Etienne, formerly Minister of
the Interior, a moderate and liberal mind
ed man. Etienne called both Brugere and
Percin to his cabinet, and all that was
known when they came out was that
they had exchanged salutes and the af
fair was ended.
CAUSE OF THE TROUBLE.
Then it was .that the real trouble be
gan. Although there had been no wit
nesses to the scene, the official agency,
Havas, came out with a story which
practically branded the generalissimo as
a coward.' Brugere, the agency stated,
had apologized to Percin, saying that he
had not seen him: and so Percin had
come forth with flying colors.. The pa
pers published indignant comments on
the commander in chief, who said noth
ing until a ' prominent politician and
newspaper editor, Ernest Judet, published
a personal attack on him. This the gen
eral could not ignore, and a challenge
followed. But the seconds demanded to
know the full truth of what had passed,
and then, in response to the demands of
his seconds, Brugere said with great sim
plicity that he had not apologized, that
he had stated the facts as they were,
that had he seen Percin he would have
had to salute, first because the army reg
ulations required it, and, secondly, be
cause Percin as his Inferior could not de
mand reparation of him; that he had
tried hla best to avoid seeing Percin,
whom he did not want to salute, and that
when Percin had forced himself forward
demanding recognition he, Brugere, as in
honor bound, had Ignored this and
squarely refused to salute, as he would In
dealing with any other man behaving
thus .toward him. The Minister had de-^
clared himself satisfied with j this expla
nation and had asked if Brugere would
then salute Percin, which Brugere pro
ceeded to do. The Minister asked If he
would shake hands with Percin, and this
Brugere declined, as it was not required
by the regulations. With matters placed
In this light no further reproach could be
made against General Brugere, -and the
Irate Journalist publicly apologized : to
Brugere for having misjudged- him on
the strength of an Inaccurate agency
note. ,
KEPT U\DER ARREST.
It was the following day that the Coun
cil of Ministers met and amazed the army
and the public generally by condemning
Brugere to two weeks'- arrest -for having
"allowed himself to, repeat what passed
in the cabinet of the Ministers." For
supplying inaccurate news . on this same
subject to a newspaper agency General
Percin, a simple staff officer, had' been
left alone; but-for telling the truth to. his
seconds in a duel arising from ' the Inci
dent the generalissimo was put under
arrest The only result of this has been
to .make Brugere the most' popular man
in the army and Percin more scorned
than ever before.
The generalissimo's arrest consisted In
not leaving his house for the space of
fifteen days except to go on official busi
ness to the Ministry of War. A sentinel
was placed outside the generalissimo's
door in the Avenue Rapp to see that he
obeyed the Minister's orders.
The London milkman covers his route

and his different measures.

FAVORITE OF EMPEROR
Gifted Young Massachusetts
Prima Donna x Receives
Many Costly Royal Gifts
Special Dispatch to Th* Call.
BERLIN, Deo. 16.-^Jeraldlne .â¢ Farrar,
the gifted young Massachusetts prima
donna, who has just been engaged by
Director Conreld of the New York Metro
politan Opera Company, Is one of
the most talked . about young wom
en In Germany â¢ and in European
artistic circles generally. She owes
her fame chiefly to her talents, for
In four years she has risen from the
ranks of theu nknown to the pinnacle of
operatic glory in this mecca of great
singers. 1 But what has made her name a
household word everywhere German is
spoken is' the friendship, she has long en
joyed with the Kaiser's familyâprincipal
ly with the young German Crown Prince,
who before his recent marriage was j her
avowed admirer. Berlin's^ yellow. press
about a year : ago indulged in sensational
stories about the relations of the slender
brunette ; Massachusetts soprano with . the
Kaiser's promising, heir. One report was
so circumstantial as to credit young
Frederick Wilhelm with a desire to re
nounce the imperial throne rather than
lese the opportunity of making Miss Far
rar i hfs bride. What is without doubt
nearer the truth is simply that the Crown
Prince, like any impressionable | youth,
had conceived a genuine fondness and ad
miration for the American . singer's tal
ents and charms, - and exercising his
princely prerogative showered upon her
such attentions / as , prima donnas from
time Immemorial have been accustomed
to- receive from royal appreciators.
The Kaiser himself has paid Miss Far
rar homage. , She v sang at . the Berlin
schloss at a private imperial dinner^par
ty two years ago. Next x day ; a court
chamberlain arrived at her home and left,
with his Majesty's compliments, a mag
nificent brooch ; representing .'_ the , : .initial
"W" set in diamonds and rubles and sur
mounted â¢by a \ tiny i imperial \ crown of
pearls. Miss Farrar*s face Is familiar to
millions of Germans because of .; the post
card likenesses of '\u25a0 her -distributed broad
cast ' throughout , the . empire.' - Since ; the
Crown Prince stories cropped out 'she has
become little short 7 of -a national charac
ter, and â¢ a secretary has been kept - busy
answering requests for autographs . and
signed photographs.
Miss Farrar lives quietly and modestly
with her parents Un: Berlin. 'Her. mother
is her constant , companion - and has at
tended every performance ':; Miss .; : Farrar.
has participated ' in,* always sharing: her
dressing-room with her. i: Mr. Farrar,. who
is known to. thousands of. American base

dine's business manager, so that the
whole familyâ father, mother and daugh
terâare actively wrapped up in the young
woman's career, y â¢ \u25a0.' -
Miss , Farrar made her . debut \u25a0\u25a0 at the
Royal Opera in erlin in November, 1901,
as Marguerite. Since then she has ap
peared in roles, her greatest successes
being in "La Traviata" and "Manon."
She commands German,. Italian- and
French repertoires and Is' gifted with un
usual dramatic ability. She has sung at (
Monte Carlo; ' Stockholm, Warsaw and
Paris, and wears the magnificent "Wasa"
diamond medal awarded by , King Oscar,
of Sweden for excellence in the vocal
art, a distinction coveted by -many and
won . by few European artists. .
Miss Farrar is a native of Melrose,
Mass., but came to Europe early In her
teens, ' and has never sung. -publicly In
her native- land except as a "wonder
child." She looks forward with girlish
enthusiasm, to . the prospect of appearing
before [ American \u25a0\u25a0 audiences as â¢ a f ull- .
fledged prima donna , with ari established
reputation In the most critical centers
of European art. Her triumphs in Ber
lin have' been won in the face of many,
real obstacles. Prejudice against her na
tionality has continued. Older women
lingers haye openly insulted and annoyed
her during performances at Berlin. On
one occasion, during the premiere of
"Manon," they attempted: by loud talking
to drown out her prettiest aria, the mani
festation of hostility and jealousy being
so pronounced that the audience made
its protest audible. Miss Farrar ls still a
very young- woman. She ' will celebrate

the Famous Story, Writer
GALILEO RELICS FOUND
Thumb and a Finger of the
Great Scientist Discovered
in Possession of Woman
Special Dispatch to ThÂ» Call.
. LONDON, Dec. 16.â Jules Verne was a'
favorite story-teller, not only with the
boys, of his own country, â¢ but with
youngsters the. world' over, so' it- will
be rather a pity if the youths of America
and England especially are not allowed
to contribute to the statue of the ro-.
mancer '\u25a0 which the â¢ lads of France are
now planning to erect at Nantes, where
Verne was born.
It really would be more appropriate If
.this memorial. to the creator of Captain
Nemo' were raised at. Amiens, the his
toric French city in â¢ which .Verne spent
practically the whole of his life, but the
idea of the statue originated with the
boys of ,the Vlycee," "or grammar school
of Nantes.: and so at Nantes the statue
will have to be."?;- V .
It is practically, certain to be erected,
for the appeal ..for aid which the boys
at Nantes have addressed to those of .the
"lycee". all. over, France -has just been
indorsed by the 5 French Department of
Education, and it has also been decided
that designs for the monument will be
exhibited in the Government School of
Fine Arts. " â¢
,' As , most ! people . know. Jules - Verne
was practically an \u25a0 untraveled } man, in
spite of i the fact. that almost every one
of his stories dealt. with, travel of onÂ©
kind- or another. .'Few are aware,'how
ever, -why the novelist stayed at 1 home
so continually. Early in his career
Verne was severely ! wounded . by a
pistol-shot,.; which put a stop- to : the
yachting that had previously beguiled
his leisure and made him more or less a
cripple. The shot was fired by a member
of Verne's own family, but the incident
was forgiven, . if not forgotten, long be
fore his. death, so there is no need to
dwell upon" it.":.
RELICS OF GALILEO.
'After^havlrig been missing: for over
sixty * years, a thumb and ..' finger - : of
Galileo, the famous discoverer of the
earth's; rotation and victim, of the In
quisition, have Just 'been 7 discovered in
sthe possession of an old woman in Flor
ence.^ Moreover it is rumored that a rich
-'American"; ls \ trying- to buy these precious
;lf ; rather srewsome relics.' and patriotic
Italians-^ are' greatly lest' their
Government "should \u25a0 fail ; to act in " time,
and, the historic digits be allowed to leave
the country. -V' *
,";The story of this thumb and finger and
of Galileo's other lthumb are 1 uncommonly
interesting." It seems that after the Italian
scientist's : ; body : . was ..' exhumed - and ' re
buried -.. in \ 1735 1 both of - the thumb? -and
iseveral fingers were removed to bo kept as
relics. . What became of the other digits
no one seems to know, but the right-hand
thumb and 'finger, which have just turned
up after being lost' for so long, were taken
charge of by Canon Vlncenzo Capponi.
The thumb of the left hand was removed
by Franc Gori, an antiquarian, who
willed it to an ecclesiastic, Canon Maria
Zandini, but on his death It was Dot to
be found. It was eventually discovered
among some waste papers, however, and
was at once put in safety in the Mediocoe-
Laurenzlana Library.
Meanwhile the other thumb and finger
had disappeared. Canon Capponi. their
original possessor, bequeathed them to
his heirs, who treasured them until IS45*
when they were lost sight' of. Writing
from Paris in October, 1599, however, the
Marquis Pier Capponi said, "I? remember
to have heard in my youth of these pre
cious relics, and believe them to exist."
So the researches were not dropped, and
It was vaguely said that the relics were
in the possession of an old woman, who
had been intrusted with the documents of
the Capponi family. In fact, they were
found in \u25a0 her , house in Florence. They
had been kept for sixty years by the old
woman, now, 84 years old. They ' were
found â¢ under ': crystal, lying on antique
Florentine, yellow satin, the frame heav
ily carved and bearing an effigy of Gali
leo.

NOBLE TAKES A
HUMBLE SPOUSE
Chooses Poverty. With the
Girl He Loves Rather Than
Great Riches Without Her
CUT OFF BY FATHER
Son of Marquis de Castro
of Naples Makes a Pretty
Turin Dressmaker His Wife
Eoecial Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON. Dec. 16.â Investigations of
romantic stories that are told in London
Police Courts generally result in strength
ening one's respect for the judgment of
the palmist who declared all men to be
liars. But, happily, there are exceptions.
By personal Inquiry It has been ascer
tained that the tale of a young Italian
nobleman's heroic sacrifice for love, which
slipped out somehow in the course of an
application the other day for a summons
for assault, is not only true, but far
more interesting than was indicated by
the brief outline of it given in the court.
Occupying with his wife a mean room
in one of London's "has been" streets, his
worldly possessions reduced to a single
suit of clothes and a few copper coins,
Is now living Ermenegaldi Rossa di Cas
tro, eldest son and heir of the Marquis
di Castro of Naples, head of one of the
most ancient and aristocratic families
in the Italian peerage.
But for the fact that he refuses to be
separated from the woman of his choice
he might exchange the squalor of a cheap
London lodging-house for the splendor of
his father's palace, whose multitudinous
windows overlook the eternal blue of the
Bay of Naples. But with an arm around
his wife's waist and the lovellght gleam-
Ing in their eyes, he assured the corre
spondent In voluble Italian (which one of
his countrymen interpreted) that he would
never retuiyi to his ancestral halls while
his father lives, unless the Marquis would
consent to receive his wife also. And
that the Marquis has declared He will
never do.
His wife Is pretty enough to grace even
a palace. But her parents are plebeian
folk, and before her marriage she earned
her living as a dressmaker, and the proud
old Marquis Is no believer in the modern
doctrine that
True hearts are more than coronets.
And simple faith than Xorman blood.
' Ermenegaldi Is only 23 years* old, tall
and good-looking, with an air of distinc
tion which is all the more marked "by con
trast with the shabby suit of clothes
which is all that remains of his once ex
tensive wardrobe. After passing through
college he entered the army and obtained
a commission In a cavalry regiment Two
years ago at Turin, where his regiment
was then stationed, he met the pretty
dressmaker and fell desperately in love
with her. *
SCE2VE WITH lUS FATHER.
''I told my father." he said, "and we
had a terrible scene. All my arguments
and pleading were in vain. My father is
an aristocrat of the old school and he is
no longer young, and it is hard, perhaps,
for age to ( sympathize with the passions
of youth. A foolish fancy, he called my
love and told me I must' and should con
quer it. For me that was Impossible.
And for the young lady, who loved me as
I loved her. It was also impossible. . We
tried It and failed. We were miserable
unless we* could be .'together. , At. last we
could stand It no longer and decided, that
THE SAN I FRANCISCO CALL; ; ; SUNDAY, DECEMBER 17, 1905.
the best years of our lives should not be
spent apart. I went to my father again
and told him there was only one woman
in the world I could be happy with, and
my mind was made up to marry her at
all costs.
"My father has always the grand man
ner, but his rage was something fearful.
He told me if I married so much beneath
meâ think of the angel I loved being be
neath me!â he would stop every farthing j
of my allowance, and as long as he lived
I should never receive another farthing
from him. Of course he could not keep
me from Inheriting the estates after his^
death, but I do not forget that he is my
father, and I hope that he may live many
years yet."
The young nobleman left his father's
roof without his father's blessing and re
sisted his commission in the army, de
termined to sacrifice everything for his
sweetheart. But then the course of true
love encountered another Obstacle. Ac- 1
cording to Italian law a son under -5
years of age cannot marry without the
father's consent. To escape this the
couple fled to Paris, only to discover that
French law imposed similar shackles on
Cupid.
They learned that things were made
easier for lovers in England and crossed
tho channel. Immediately after their ar
rival in London they were married at the
church of St. Peter in Clerkenwell, the
church of the Italian colony. That was
four months ago. Ermenegaldi sent a
copy of the marriage certificate to his
father. The Marquis acknowledged It by
promptly cutting off "his son's allow
ance.
HARD FIGHT WITH POVERTY.
/ Emerson once sal'd that the chief
value of a college education Is to teach
a man how little It Is worth. Ermene
galdi speedily discovered the truth of
tnis when he began to hustle for a liv
ing. He was a man wtihout a trade
and his accomplishments counted for
nothing. The few hundred dollars that
he had brought with him were soon ex
hausted, for his early training had not
included lessons in economy. Then .re
course was had to the pawnshop. When
nearly everything he possessed had
been pledged he humbled his pride and
wrote a pathetic appeal to his father
in his beautiful palace. This was the
answer he got from -the old, Marquis:
"My Dear Son: You shall have the
run (as of yore) of my palace and my
horses and carriages. All that I have
is yours, and I shall be only too pleased
to clasp you in my arms once more if
you return. But you must return
alone. Until my dying day I refuse to
recognize the woman you have so fool
; ishly married below your station."
Poverty had entered the door, but
love did not fly out of the window. Er
menegaldi declared he would do "any
thing" for a living before he would
leave his wife. The only "anything"
his unskilled hand could find to do was
lathering customers on busy nights in
the barber's shop on the ground floor.
The barber' was an Italian. . If he had
possessed .the business instinct of the
average American he would have ad
vertised the fact that the son and heir
of the Marquis dl Castro was perform
ing nightly with the shaving -brush,
and the increase of patronage would
have made the young nobleman's ser
vices worth a good salary. But :he
didn't do it and the amateur : latherer
was able to earn only a small pittance
I not nearly enough for' two young I
lovers with healthy appetites to live
upon. â¢ \u25a0 /,
Then his wife had recourse to .her
former trade and purchased a sewing
machine on the installment plan. She
also*, neglected to advertise" the .fact
that she was the wife of an Italian no
bleman, and the little odd jobs she got
did not suffice to enable her to keep up
her payments on the machine. "â¢.'--.'.
The sewing. machine company sent a
man to remove â¢\u25a0 it. yj It Is alleged that he
laid rough hands on- the ; pretty bride.
That ; led \u25a0to an : application â¢â¢\u25a0 for; a.' sum
mons. for assault, and \u0084 through \ that
London obtained its first inkling of the
pretty and pathetic - romance. Perhaps (
, when to hears wtiat folks heco thtnfc si
it, and what they are saying of him,
the stern old Marquis may relent. Any
how, it has given the young nobleman
an advertisement that may go far to
ward helping him get a good job.'
ArtlMle and Useful.
â¢ Strangers to a city are ever at a loss
to "know their way around" until a
certain length of residence has given
familiarity with streets and points of
interest. Tourists coming to San Fran
cisco may be easily relieved of annoy
ance in that direction- by procuring at
any book store one of the most com
plete and artistic maps ever produced
of this city and county, which has been
designed and published by Aug. Cheva
lier, 331 Kearny street. The map Is
complete in detail, showing the topog
raphy of the town and the. elevation of
the principal buildings, drawn in mini
ature. These^ features are cleverly in
troduced without in any way marVing
the map's clearness or completeness.
FRLXCESS BIANCA COLONNA
TO WED AFTER CHRISTMAS
Elaborate Preparations Being Made for
Cerciuony to. Occur Late â¢%
In Month.
PARIS, Dec. 16.â 1t was at Mrs. Mil
.llngton Drake's reception this week
that Paris society learned the definite
arrangements for the .wedding of Prin
cess Bianca Stigliano-Colonna and
Count Jules de Bonvouloir. It is the
specialty of her salon, as the guests
remarked, that things happen there. ,
This was the first appearance of the
engaged couple together at a social
function. The Princess looked very
young and very pretty, and her rela
tions with her fiance impressed every
one- with the idea of a true love match.
.The presence and affable cordiality
of the Marquise deCastellane, Count
Boni's formidable mother, was taken as
a sign that the Bonvouloir3 would be
caught to the .heart of the best circles.
The Princess made no secret of her in
tense enjoyment of her dally shopping
expeditions with Mrs. Mackay and (the
Count, buying jewels and objects of art
and selecting furniture, which Mrs.
Mackay gives on a truly princely scale
to her grandchildren.
Society says Mrs. Mackay is giving
an Immense sum of money down to the
young couple, besides a trousseau the
costliest that' the Rue de la Paix af
fords. The Princess insists,^ upon so
many dresses in rose pink) her fa
vorite color, that the modistes are in
despair at the task of designing some
twenty robes with sufficient difference
in one color scheme. It is agreed that
the. wedding robe is to be of childish
simplicity and not even -very costly, a
modest^ confection for some few hun
dred jdollars. Even the priceless lace
for which agents are hunting over* E
urope will not' appear at the ceremony.
In other respects the wedding isto be
one of the most striking celebrations
within the memory ofParis.
' No trust is to be placed In the rumor

NOTED SOLDIER
HAS RETIRED
General William Butler of
the British Army Is No
Longer on the Active List
HIS EXCELLENT RECORD
Disregard of His Advice in
the Boer Trouble Costs
England a Terrible Price
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, Dec. 16.â -Having attained
his sixty-seventh "birthday, which
marks the age limit in the British
army, Lieutenant General Sir William
Butler, K. C. B.; has retired from the
active list and the empire loses there
by the services of one of its most fear
lessly honest and capable soldiers.
There are not a few who are glad to
see him' go, for he is a sworn foe to
red-tapism, old-fogyism and ; the
take-things-easy system which are re
sponsible for. so much incompetence in
the British army. *
In his distinguished career of forty
seven years thoroughness has always
been a characteristic of Butler. His
last service was a scathing exposure
of the South African war stores scan
dals, by which the country was
swindled out of _ millions of dollars.
He shocked the ' easy-chair occupants
of' the War Office and violated all the
traditions of the â¢ service by writing
the report in such a style that it ac
tually made interesting reading The
Government did its best to shelve It
by starting a cumbersome and pro
tracted inquiry into the matter, but
the Liberal party can be depended on,
now that it -is in power, to see to it
that it is not dropotd.
Butler himself is a stanch Liberal
and it is not improbable that he may
obtain" a seat in Parliament at the next
general election. Unmuzzled and free
from the military shackles. he would
be a power there.
Like many brilliant British soldiers, he
was born in Ireland. He entered Sand
hurst, the Government military college, in
1856, and two years later was gazetted
to a regiment. Those were the days
when commissions were obtained by pur
chase, and as he had not the means to
buy one, promotion came to him slowly.
He saw. some service -in ..Canada.' where
his mllltaTy/ talents and map-sketching
attracted the- attention of Colonel (now
ViÃcount) Wolseley, : who "appointed him
to a military survey party/
HIS ABRIJPT TELEGRAM.
After twelve years' v service he was at
the age of -thirty-one [only a. senior sub
altern,' ; wnile > many., ' other i men with far
less ability, but blessed with much longer
purses' and backed by aristocratic infiu
once.'were, far" ahead of him. Repeated
applications to be. put on special service
met with no; response because he lacked
the ; necessary "pull" . and his career
seemed almost closed.'. /^.
, .But in UB7O he saw his chance and went
for .-' it.v Colonel -Wolseley was then â¢ or
ganizing the, Red River /expedition. With
characteristic disregard for red tape. But
lers sent ithis cable ; to the future * com
mandpr-in-chief:
\u25a0'"Colonel Wolseley, .Winnipeg expedition
please remember' me;j Ãutler, 69th . Regt ''
. : ; No ; reply; came apdi the War : Office/
proving -equally ideaf ; to his iraportunl-
Itlest' fae obtained leave of abaeace : anil
sailed for Canada at his own expense.
There he personally interviewed
Colonel Wolseley. The latter was
greatly impressed by" the spirit of the
young officer, but shook his head at the
suggestion of an appointment, declar
ing that every post had .been filled.
The pertinacious and audacious Butler,
however, insisted that there was one
berth yet unfilled, and that was that
of intelligence officer, who would let
him know what was afoot in Minne
sota and along the flank of his ad
vance. It was a good shot and the
post was created for him.
During the advance he met Colonel
Wolseley in a forest by preconcerted
plan and supplied him with most val
uable Information. This was the foun
dation of his career, for the command
er of the expedition, destined to be a
great military figure, never again left
Butler out of any active service with
which he himself was connected. But
ler's, services In Ashantl received spe
cial recognition in' Sir Garnet "Wolse
ley's dispatches. He distinguished
himself in South Africa during the
Zulu war and did magnificent work in
the Egyptian war in 18S2 and in the
later Soudan campaign.
SHELVED IX THE BOER AVAR.
â¢ The story of what at the time was prac
tically : his military martyrdom "in South
Africa is well known. He not only fore
saw the fighting strength of the Boers,
but mistrusted the capitalists of South
Africa and all their ways. and works. His
warning to the Government prior to the
war made him the target of the most
malignant attacks by the imperialist
party, and led to his recall under cir
cumstances hardly short of public dis
honor. Had his warning been heeded
there would either have been no war, or
a war much more brief and much le3S
costly, because it would have been . en
tered upon with knowledge of what sort
of a job the army ~ad to tackle/
Yet, owing to the obtusenesa of the
Government and Its advisers, the British
empire waa deprived of the advantages
of the unique knowledge and experience
of Sir William Butler at a time when his
services would 1 have been of priceless
value in the' field. He. left his vindica
tion to time and did 'not" have long to
wait for it. ': r ri; *=>;
Butler has. written several books. "The
Great Lone Land," a delightful work
published as far back as 1572. showed him
to possess in a rare degree the art of lit
erary expression. He has to his credit
three first-rate military biogaphlesâ the
lives of General Gordon, Sir Charles Na
pier and Sir George Coilay. He married
in 1877 Miss Elizabeth Thompson, whose
"Roll Call" and other military pictures
have made her almost as famous as Is her
husband.

Terms of Van Duzers
Mining Department
Bill Given.
Charles D. Wolcott, director j of the
United States Geological Survey,
nounces that the Geological Survey ex
presses its -willingness to co-operate with
miners and with States on all proper
occasions and instances the extent to
which such co-operation has already ex
tended. Some of the statements of more
than common interest to miners are
reproduced herewith. , . _
. - \u0084 â 9 - \u25a0
This year the survey is giving effective as
sistance to mining by ths preparation of topo
graphical base maps, areal geological maps,
detailed economic geological maps of mining
districts, with descriptive text, studies result
ing in monographic reports on mining dstriots
to solve the fundamental problems of ore oc
currence and deposition, reconnoissance work
and reports on new mining districts, statistics
of mineral production. Inspections and reports
on current development of mining districts
and investigations that are beyond the power
of the individual or corporation relating to the
economic utilization of natural resurces, such
as coal and cements. ,^ -,.-;.-.
Co-operation In topographic work is now
carriedon with California, Illinois Kentucky.
Maine .Maryland. Michigan, New Tork, North
Carolina, Ohio Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsyl
vania and West Virginia. The appropriations
made by the States for co-operative surveys
in topography are used chiefly for actual Held
work in which are Included the salaries of
temporary employes, who are usually residents
of the State, and for the living and traveling
expenses of the field force. It may be used for
paying office salaries only bo far as it is neo
essary to equalize the expenses of both parties
to the co-operation.
The survey is engaged in co-operative work
in geology with the States of Maine, New
Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia.-
North Carolina. Alabama, Missouri and Wash
ington. The form of co-operation varies wide
ly. In some States, as Maine and Pennsyl
vania an appropriation is made by the State
and Dlaced in the hands of commissioners
who are authorized to arrange for co-operation
with the Federal Survey. An amount equal
to the State appropriation is allotted by the
Federal Survey and the work is done entirely
by the organization. By this form of
co-operation the funds available for expendi
ture on geologic wcrk within the State are
doubled and the representatives of the State

VAN UUZER'S MEASURE.
Congressman Van Duzer of Nevada has
a bill to provide for the establishment of
a National Department of Mines and
Mining, which will'be introduced in Con
gress at the present session. The leading
provisions- of the bill are that there shall
be a secretary to be appointed by. the
President, to have a; salary of $8000 a
year;., an assistant secretary at $4000 a
year; that there shall be in the depart
ment a bureau for the collection of sta
tistics relating to mining and for the
dissemination of useful information re
lating to., mines and mining;, transferring
the office of the director of the Geological
Survey from the jurisdiction of, the In
terior Department to the supervision of
the Department of Mines and Mining.
The following section gives more insight
into the ecope of the bill: -
Section 3â That the said Department of Mines
and Mining shall have general Jurisdiction over
all the matters pertaining to mines and min
ing industries and the Geological Survey and
over all the matters committed to any of the
bureaus, \u25a0'â¢ offices, departments or ' branches of
the public service by this act transferred from
other executive departments of the Govern
ment to the aaid Department of Mines and
Mining as fully as the same Is now possessed
by any of the said bureaus offices, depart
ments or branches of the public service from
whence the same is co transferred, and that
the official records and papers now on -file in
and relating to the business -of any such bu
reau office department or branch of the pub
lic service, in this act transferred to the De
partment of Mines and Mining, together with
the furniture now in use In such bureau, office,
department or branch, of the public- servlco,
shall bo and is hereby transferred to the De
partment of Mines and Mining.
The Redding Searchlight tells of the
work In Trinity County, where Horton
has been investigating, with a view to
dredging for gold:
D Horton of Browns Valley has completed
the task of prospecting with a Keystone driller
400 acres of placer ground on the Heurteyant
place down the river. Two drillers were -in
operation most of the time since September.
The Keystone that was brought down from
Trinity Center was set to work on September
20 and the second driller was started up on
September 30. Now that the work la . com
pleted the eecond driller has been shipped back
to Butte County, its destination being Pa
lermo.
ThÂ« area prospected was COO yards long from
east to west and 300 yards from north to south.
The Trinity River flows westerly through the
atrip. Sixty-nine holes were bored, their
depth varying from twenty to forty- six feet.
The holes are six Inches In diameter. Prospects
were taken every foot and a half. The aurifer
ous eand was panned out In the usual manner
and a careful record of each was kept. These
records will be referred to Pierre Bouery upon
his return this month rrom France. Upon
his decision will depend whether the ground
of the Valdor Company will -pay to work by
the dredger process. Mr. Bouery Is trustee for
the Valdor Company or tTie Heurtevant Inter
ests Little or no hydraulicking has been done
on the Heurtevant mine since the murder or
the owner, Francis Heurtevant.
The old Ball mine in Sisklyou County
will be reopened. Supplies for six months
have been sent to the mine/The prop
erty has been idle something like two
years, owing to litigation. It is in the
Salmon district. .Formerly it was owned
by the Yreka Mill and Mining Company.
The principal parties concerned were resi
dents of Ohio. ; -
Concerning work in Sisklyou County
in general, the Yreka Journal reports :

The Shasta Courier reports the. bond
ing of the. Greenhorn claims in , the
French Gulch . region. . The account is, in
part, as follows: t
The French Gulch district, co long known
for its gold production, carries also many pay
ing â¢ copper propositions. Nothing, though, . on
a large scale \u25a0 has so â¢ far â¢ been done -\u25a0 to â¢; the
west of Keswlck with the baser of metals. A
deal completed within the â¢ past \u25a0 few . days,"
however, promises much for. that district.' The
Greenhorn group, which consists of six claims,
about 120 acres, and located', near French
Gulch,' has been bonded . to J. ;B. Keating,
general manager of the Bully Hill Mining
and Smelting. Company. .The deal is made by

ORE RATES ARE REDUCED.
A matter! of considerable interest 'to*. the
miners of the newer districts ; in Nevada
is treated -by '\u25a0 the 'Goldfleld \u25a0 Sun, ~ which
makes the "l following : , report: . -
- The. long-talked-ofl' change j in the hauling
rates of ,- ore :to the " outside \ smelters f . has "at
last' come 'about..; Though .the reductions are
not very:KTeat,' : it 'is considered : a; step in 'the
right ' direction \u25a0 and; gives the mine owners of
Goldfield a chance to ship , ore profitably which
formerly could not be shipped except at a loss.
It 'la- thought that should any further changes
be necessary, \u25a0 Superlnteudent . .Tripp ot/ the
Tonopah and Goldaelds Railroad will listen to
a delegation of mine owners and agree to any
reasonable concessions. \u25a0 '
."â¢ Under the old rates ores . in value from ?25
to $50 were 'hauled from Goldneld ito Mlna
for |4 v per ton. .Three -grades. of this ore are
now made." Ore not exceeding $30 per ton is
hauled - between â¢ the S above I point 9 for : $2 10;
ore over $30 to $40. $2 80; ore over $40 to $50,
$3 20. .The rate to Salt Lake on $30 to $40 ore
is $5, and over $40 to $50 is' sB 75. â¢ From To
nopah to Mlna, -the rates â¢on , the two first
grades -are 60 cents Der ton - less. - and on the
higher grades $120 per ton less.
It .is . claimed . that this reduction will en
able mine owners ' hereafter to ship $40 ore
profitably. The 1 , bulk of the ore shipped' out
of Tonopah is said not to exceed $40 per ton;
Those who are close at figuring claim that
the rate of this kind of ore to Salt Lake being
$7 80 per ton, with treatment and sampling at
$11, and mining. Backing and sorting at $6,
It brings 1 the total up :to~JJ2B, which' ehould
leave a margin of $15 profit. The larger mines
which it is , thought \u25a0 can easily average 300
tons per day are. thus open to make large prof
its, and will eventually' be In a position to
say dividends.
On ore over $00 to $100 the old rate from
Goldfield to Mlna was ?8 60, but it is now
$5 95. and on ore over $100 to $150 the old
rate was $7 35, and is now $6 SO. The claim
19 made that the present rate la les9 than
what it was formerly from Tonopah, when
thousands of tons were profitably shipped.
A revival in mining is now predicted in
many properties that have practically lain dor
mant for some t ime. "It is a well-known fact
that thousands of tons of ore have been lvinsr
sacked at many of the Goldfleld mines for
some months awaiting a' readjustment of the
rates, and in all probability these will now
be fihltrped and more miners will be put to
work before very long breaking more ore.
Should this occur, Goldfleld will experience a
repetition of the prosperous times when bo
many lessees were sacking and shipping ore a
little over a year ago.
ARE NOT HYDRAULICKING.
The Miner Transcript, published at
; Nevada City; under the caption .of j "no
1 hydraullcklng can go on at present,"
publishes the following: ' editorial, sum
mary of the conditions in Nevada
County:
Within the last <ew days the waters of the
Tuba River as they flow past Marysvllle have
been muddy. This ha's led the residents of
that city to fear that hydraulic mining is be
ing illegally carried on and the Democrat
voices this apprehension.
Lit ua assure the Democrat that physical
1 conditions In these hills and . mountains at
present absolutely prevent hydraulic mining,
legal or illegal, and the injunction of tbe
drought is tighter than" that of any court ever
in existence. With conditions such as now
obtain none of the monitors, even in the old
days, would have sufficient head to scatter a
feather bed.
The mills are silent and all the -water that
comes down the ditches is scarcely sufficient
for the domestic needs of Grass Valley and Ne
vada City. The mines are closed down.
The muddlness of . the river may have been
due to work on the . ditches. On Friday and
Saturday it was noted that the Middle Tuba,
on which there is no hydraullcklng, carried
some loam, and it la not improbable that some
ditch that was blocked broke and ground
sluiced down a hillside. But in that event, it
seems to us, all the debris would have been
kept back by the Government barrier below
Parks Bar bridge, and may it not be that the
trouble is closer to MaryÃVllle than the bar
rier? May not a dredge have struck a streak
of mud? '
The Democrat speaks of illegal mining on
the Bear .River. - We know nothing about that,
but the recent heavy rain is ' more likely to
have washed down earth from the plowed
farms and j orchards, it would appear, than
that a hydraulic mine could be developed with
no head of water in the ditches. There are
many farms and orchards on that watershed. :
BAXK OP CALIFORNIA HELD IX
HIGH ESTEEM BY PEOPLE
Integrity and Safe and Progressive
Business Methods Have Broutrbt
'. the Old Institution. Prosperity.'
â¢ "It's a. good old bank and the people
have confidence in it. It'll be here as
long as there is a San Francisco."
This was the tribute paid to the Bank
of California
man recently, 'and it expresses some of
the esteem, almost reaching veneration, \u25a0'.
in which this solid institution is held
by the people of this city and the en
tire West. The Bank of California is
certainly deserving of all the kind
words that can be said of it, for it has
been a rock of strength in the financial
world and a safeguard for a legion of
depositors and others who have done
their financial business with it.
The Bank of California was founded
in 1564. Associated with it have al
ways been men of the highest financial
sjtanding, of the safest business meth
ods and the keenest business acumen â
men whose names were an earnest of
integrity and stability â and from the
start inspired a confidence that nothing
could shake. As a result the Bank of
California progressed every year of its
existence, and with a rapidity that was
remarkable even in the rapidly grow
ing California metropolis. It has
reached, as the year 1906 is about to
begin, a height in the financial and
banking world, a position of wealth
and influence, that mark It as one of
the stanchest concerns of its kind in
'existence and give it a clientele that
â¢ extends over, a wide range of business
and individual interests, all safeguard
ed by the Integrity of this solid insti
tution.
The magnitude of the Bank of Cali
fornia and its splendid financial stand

DUCHESS OF SOMERSET TAKES
STAND AGAINST FAIRY TALES.

"CAESAR'S COMMENTARIES^ IN THEIR., PLACE. â¢
Special Dispatch to -The Call.
LONDON, Dec. 16. â It makes a big
difference who says a thing. If in the
days when the Duchess of Somerset
was plain Misg Susan- Mackinnon. she
hafi expressed the opinion that fairy
tales are. undesirable .' reading for
juvenile minds nobody would have at
tached any weight, to her views on the
subject. But .when recently as "her
grace," she: walked Into the parish
school at Maiden Bradley,' in Wiltshire,
near her own stately residence, and find
ing one of the teachers" reading "Beauty,
and â¢ the Beast" -to a, class â¢of children,
expressed the opinion that they could
get no good from such stories, and that
the biography of Julius Caesar would
constitute a far better mental diet for
them, all England heard of it next day.
It started a big pow-wow and several
titled dames with literary reputations
have entered the lists on behalf of
"Cinderella," "Jack and the Bean

FARIS, Dec. 16.'â The popular belief
In the curative and constructive efH

researches of the youngr bacteriologist,
Rene Qulnton, who has |discovered that
in all superior ' forms of animal life,
man included, the liquid in which all
the Internal organs ' are perpetually ;
bathed is chemically if enttcal with sea
water slightly diluted. He deduces from
this that animal life was first formed
in the sea. Even animals habituated to
fresh water contain" as a necessity of
llf e eÂ»a water from which they ( are
first nourished and vitalised.
The peculiar power of sea water is
derived from the fact that It practi
cally contains every chemical element
known, from gold to potassium.. The
animal organism is a sort of sea water

Combined Institutions Make
One of the Strongest Fi-^
nancial Concerns in
. the World.
When two of the largest and most
prosperous banks of a great commer
cial city combine and become one insti
tution, the result is a concern of finan
cial size and solidity* that commands the
attention and confidence. of the business
world, and particularly of all of the
people that do business with banking
institutions. One of the principal finan
cial events of the last year in this city
and one of the most important banking
events of the West was the consolidation
of the Wells, Fargo & Co. Bank and the
Nevada National Bank under the title
of Wells Fargo Nevada National Bank
of San Francisco. The consolidation waa
commented on in financial circles all
over the country.
Both banks have had a long and
prosperous history, that of Wells, Far
go.& Co. .dating from 1852 and that of
the Nevada from the bonanza times of
1875. when it was organized by Messrs.
Mackay, Fair, Flood and O'Brien in
order to handle with facility and safety
the vast wealth that was flowing in
from .the mines of the Comstock lode.
Isaias W. Hellman, the president of
the Nevada National, arranged- the con
solidation and is the president of Wells
Fargo Nevada National Bank. Mr.
Hellman is so well known in financial
circles hero and throughout the United
States that his, name is a tower of
strength. He is recognized all over the
country as one of its ablest and, most
successful financiers. â¢
Wells Fargo Nevada National Bank
has a capital paid up of $6,000,000 and
a surplus of $3,500,000. The total as
sets* reach the enormous amount of
$40,072,870 32, as shown by its last
statement to the Comptroller, dated
November 9, 1905. Sound and progres
sive in its methods, it is abreast of the
times in all requirements of the bank
ing business. While particularly iden
tified with the upbuilding of the indus
tries of the Pacific Coast its foreign
business is very large.
Wells Fargo Nevada National Bank "Is
now located at Montgomery and Pine
streets, |in -the quarters occupied by
the Nevada Bank before the consoli
dation. The directors and officers are:

Corniptiop. Known to Exist
iii the Politics of Great
Britain on a Big Scale
VOTES OPENLY BOUGHT
Worst Conditions Prevail in
the Seaport Towns and
Small Cities of Country
LONDON, Dec. 11.â English politicians
have always toasted that their elections
are less corrupt than those of America,
As a matter of fact, recent .evidence,
taken at various / elections in different
parts of England, proves that corruption
is Just as rampant in the British Isles as
anywhere else in the world.
The methods of influencing votes may
be slightly different in England; but tho
fact that widespread corruption exists
cannot be denied. The very stringent
Parliamentary measure known as the
corrupt practices act is practically a dead
letter; and its operation is so costly when
applied that it has little deterrent effect
on tho buying and selling of "the ballot
One of tha foremost election agents in
England, F. W. Galton, secretary of the
London Reform Union, a man who prob
ably knows more about electioneering
methods In England than - any one else,
when seen at his London office^ made the
following statement with reference to cor
ruption in English politics:
The recent charge of corruption at Yar
mouth, where some say a sy6tem worse- than
Tammany's prevnlis. Is undoubtedly true. 1
have attended hundreds of elections all over
England and I know personally that candi
dates on both sides use Illegal methods for ob
taining votes. It , Is a singular phenomenon
that there is more corruption In the English
seaport towns than elsewhere, and especially
in the small places. The reason why corrup
tion does not thrive so wen in, the larger town 3
is not because they are better, but because the
buying of votes would be too costly an item.
Our corrupt practices act is a very cumber
some thing, and any one who wishes to chal
lenge an election must first deposit $5000. Even
where it is known that almost open buying of
votes goes on it is not every one who Is willing
to raise the money to bring the case to trial.
Besides this $3000 the legal costs are enormous.
I remember when the election of Harry Marks
for St. Georges-ln-the-East (a large borough of
London) was challenged, not long ago, the legal
costs came to $35,000. though he was. finally
unseated.
One of the most recent cases was the unseat
ing of Dr. Rutherford Harris at Monmouth, in
Wales, which cost a lot or money, and another
case was that of Mr. barker' at Maldstone.
Mr. Barker's brother was cent to prison. He
had given money away in a cab to a number
of voters. t
I myself have often seen agents for candi
dates standing on the corners (or "just around
the corner" to be out or too public a place),
Jingling little bags of gold. The usual price
for an English vote is half a sovereign, about
$2 bO, though more than $25 is paid when
things are very close. Places like Dover,
Gravesend, Chatham, Coventry â as I said, most
seaport towne in England â are absolutely rot
ten. So much so that I could not act as an
elt-ctior. agent at any of them without fear of
lesing my reputation.
Even when a candidate knows he \u25a0 will be
defeated, it is often customary for him to buy
votes, give dinners and "treats" of various
kinds, in order to reduce his rival's majority
so that the defeated man will, have a better
chance next time. No matter how many bribes
a defeated candidate may have offered most
openly, no one ever prosecutes. It is only
when the candidate wins, and the other side
wishes to oust him, that the money is raised
to brine what we call a petition or a chal
lenge. Therefore, it might be said, one side
is as bad as another.
Corruption exists in the smaller places be-

MAYOR OF. A CITY IN. GREAT
- BRITAIN.
cause everybody knows everybody tint, \u25a0 and
when you hand a man his price, you know you
are safe â you know your â¢\u25a0 man; whereas In
larger places, you may not know Just who you
are dealing with, and you might accidentally
try to bribe a policeman,"" or an, opposition
party. It -Is not that the bigger places are
purerâ far from! lt. Even In Liverpool, there
was a bis corruption case some time i ago
because the votes of a lot of aliens, who had
no legal right to go to the polls, were cast.
The election -was challenged, and the candi
date, at heavy cost running Into thousands of
pounds, \u25a0was unseated.
There are lots . of tips floating about at
every English election, and plenty ' of ' what 1
Americans call 'â¢grafting" going on. The fact
that regular high-priced Judges are specially
appointed to take charge of these cases shows
that the thing exists. " Â»
I know personally hundreds or elections In
England where both candidates spent tons of
money, and the most open corruption went on
under the eyes^of anybody who cared to see It.
On the whole; I might say that an English
election is not one bit better or * purer than
an American one, only our methods are slight
ly differentâ perhaps. .

Special Dispatch to Tha Call.
LONDON, Dec. 16. â Since Battersea
eleoted John Burns, the washerwoman's
son and* labor leader, to Parliament,
triumphant democracy has done much
to break down conventional barriers to
political advancement in that once
rather fashionable district, but its lat
est achievement eclipses all others. It
has chosen a working tailor, "Walter
Rln.es, as its Mayor and chief citizen
for 1906. Mayor Rines claims to be
the first knight of the needle who has
ever attained to such high civic dig
nity In the municipal history of Great
Britain, and his . fellow .craftsmen
throughout the country ; are proud of
the distinction which his election con
fers upon them. - When congratulating
Rlnes upon his success, : John Burns
said that '< if Battersea possessed a
chimney sweep of the right stamp
who would- pledge his support to de
mocracy they would elect him Mayor
of Battersea for 1907.
Although Mayor Rines is a'.'xnllltant
democrat in \ politics,' he is "an aristo
crat in his trade and one would not be
surprised to learn that both' the King
and Joseph Chamberlain had congratu
lated him on his new 'won honor, for
in his time he has caused both of them
to be regarded as the best dressed
men in. England. :. .
\u25a0 "I have often," he said,: "helped to
transform .Mr. Chamberlain into a
model of sartorial - perfection, despite
the difficulties which his figure offers,
but that was before he 'became a po
litical turncoat." â¢
Like most workingmen who have risen
to prominence and positions of trust
among their fellows, the tailor-Mayor has
had his share of hard times. He has
tramped hundreds of miles in search of
work and has often been "dead . broke."
He tells a pathetic story of having once
had his pocket picked of the m'oneyxhe
had saved to pay his railway fare from
Manchester . to London, whither he was
going ' in , search of employment, $ and in
consequence he had to walk the entire
distance, which took him a week.
He no. longer t makes clothes for the
King, but is prouder of the fact that he
is responsible for. the blue Berge reefer
6uits of- the i "Battersea pet," as John
Burns is familiarly called. As Mayor of
Battersea he draws no pay and is proud
of this, too, because it shows he has not
sought the post for the sake of what he
gets out of it.
He Is now 40 years old, and despite his
sedentary . employment enjoys robust
health, which he attributes in no small
degree to j the fact that he has always
been a temperate man. He has two
brothers in New York who are engaged
In evangelistic work there, while a third
Is doing his best to make converts among '
the. miners of Montana. ' ,

'Shortly After Her Rate Is
Kaised to Â±0 Per Cent
.The Pacific Mail liner Manchuria,
Captain J. \\\ Saundt^rs in command,
sailed yesterday afternoon for the
Orient with fewer passengers than
usual, but with about all the cargo
she could accommodate. When It be
gan to rain in a business-like way on
Friday afternoon 1700 tons of freight
for the Manchuria stood pifed on the
wharf. Work was stopped and v more
than three hours lost in the rigging of
awningt. When work was resumed. it
proceeded slowly and it was feared that
either the liner's sailing would have to
be postponed or much of the freight
left on the wharf.
. Then the weather cleared. Additional
men were put on and under Captain
Wilson's personal supervision the work
was rushed to the limit of the men's
endurance. All night long the steve
dores toiled and by -10 o'clock ye&terday
morning the dock was clear. The Man
c-liuiia was loaded and she sailed three
boars later with more than Is, ooo tons
ot cargo stuwed away in her holds.
Among the passengers were some
prominent Honolulu people. K. Taka

OUT OF FUNDS
Says He Has Decided to Have
His New Play Produced
in Order to Raise Money
PINERO'S LATEST DRAMA.
"His House in Order" Is Said
to Have for Its Theme a
Feud Between Two Women
LONDON, DEC. 11.â It appears that M.
Edmond Rostand is possesfced of the true
artistic temperament. When he has made
a lot of money he is cbntent, and does
not think seriously about making, any
more,' until the threatened exhaustion of
his available resources renders It abso
lutely imperative. This weakness of his
the author of "Cyrano de Bergerac" has
just confessed to a French interviewer,
the first who has ever made him "talk,"
apropos of Coquelln's coming production
of his new bird drama, "Chanteclair," of
which so much has already been written.
"I would much rather 'Chanteclair'
were not played at all," sajd Rostand,
"but I am in need of money and it is
five years since a new play of mine was
produced. When 'L'Aiglon* was given, it
was only because I had spent all the
money I made out of 'Cyrano,' and I am
parting from my new play only because
I have sauandered all I made out of
'L'Aiglon. 1 I have the mind of a gambler.
This is the second time that I have ruined
myself, and the sensation is delicious."
It seems that the dramatist Is "ruining
himself" this time by building, a house
"as big as a' town" near Cambo. The
rooms are being "Illustrated" by well
known artists.
Rostand doesn't share the popular opin
ion that "Cyrano" is his best play, but
says that "La Samaritalne" is the only
one of his works which he likes alto
gether. In his new work. "Chanteclair,"
the date of which has not been set defi
nitely, the animal and bird characters
will talk as In Aristophanes, and the ac
tion will be satiric Coquelln will play
the cock; his son, M. Jean Coquelin, a
big dog; M. Gallpaux, a black bird, and
Mme. Simone Le Bargy, a quail.
"T do not know what I myself think of
'Chanteclair,* " said Rostand, "and can
only wait; for the public opinion. I would
like to lose my manuscript at the bottom
of some chest, forget , it for several
months, take up something quite differ
ent, then one fine day, just by chance,
while rummaging among some old pa
pers, find it again. I should then read it,
not as an author, but in the spirit of a
mere spectator."
NEW PI.A Y BY PINERO.
On this side of the water at least
every scrap of information that can be
elicited regarding a new-Plnero play
is of the utmost moment, so there has
been much interest in a little piece of
news that the dramatist has allowed to
become public about his forthcoming:
drama for George Alexander. It seems
that.jlike "The Second Mrs. Tanqueray,"
the new play has a good deal ,to,do
with a feud between two women,* who
in this case are to be played by Irene
Vanbrugh and Beryl Faber, the wife of
Cosmo Hamilton. Mrs. Kendal once de
clared that Pinero knew women,, not
as the average man knows them, but
as they know themselves, and if the
dramatist can give* another Paula Tan
queray and Mrs. Cartel yon there is not
much' doubt as to his new play's suc
cess. It has been .named definitely "His
House In Order" and may be expected
early in January.
LONDON TO SEE BRIER BUSH.
Meanwhile, however, the St. James's,
which the Kehdals vacate this week, is
to be given up to the first London pro
duction of "Beside the Bonnie Brier
Bush." It is an odd ' thing that this
dramatization of lan Maclaren's book,
which proved so successful in the
United States, should have been so
long in getting before the footlights
here, but in compensation William Mol
lison promises a strong picture of
Drumtochty. This actor,, who is a
former member of Henry Irving's com
pany, will himself play the rugged old
kirk elder of Maclaren's stories, while
Henry Ainley, Lillian Braithwaite and
Frank Cooper will also be included in
an uncommonly strong cast.
"The Little Father of the Wilder
ness," by Lloyd Osbourne, Robert Louis
Stevenson's American stepson, pro
duced here at the Comedy Theater with
marked success this week, served to in
troduce to the field of legitimate drama
Huntley Wright, an actor who has al
ways been to England what Francis
Wilson, at the height of his fame, was
to the United States, even to the funny
little voice and the phenomenally lim
ber legs. Wright was surprisingly
sympathetic as Pere Marlotte, but much
less attractive in a wild German farce,
"The Mountain : Climber," which fol
lowed Lloyd Osbourne's piece. The
play, wittily adapted by Cosmo Hamil
ton, was the usual array of lies told
by '. a scapegrace, husband. It was
greeted with roars of laughter.
BISHOP OP LO3VDOX SAID
TO KNOW GOOD WINES
Objects When Bad Sherry Is Palmed
Oft on Hliu for Rare Old
3ladcira. /
LONDON. Dec. 16.â The Bishop of
London, who recently caused a sensa
tion ,by denouncing drunkenness among
the undergraduates at Oxford, sets' a
stern example of rigid abstinence from
intoxicants of all kinds at, banquests
and other -festive occasions. A story
now going round- may possibly account
for his temperate example. V 'â¢' \u25a0
When a clergyman from a; distance
preached at v the Chapel â¢ "Royal, " . St.
James, in - the days of the good old
Queen., it was customary / to place in
the vestry for his refreshment a bottle
of rare old Madeira, brought from the
royal cellars 1 ' of '; Buckingham Palace.
On one occasion Dr. Ingram, it was
long before he . became a : Bishop, was
the preacher and the customary bottle
was opened for- him. - A ; glassful was
poured. out and the reverend gentleman
put it to his. lips, but: promptly reject
ed the ; liquor^ with expressions of \u25a0 dis
gust, declaring emphatically that x it
was rankbad sherry.' Inquiries -being
made, it was. discovered- that the old
verger had been iin the habit of selling
the royal Madeira from; her Majesty's
cellars "and : : for if the
cheapest. sherry : he could buy. He at
tempted to justify, his â¢ conduct by say
ing: thathe did not believe in wasting
good ; wine on - people .; who generally
were incapable' of appreciating it. 1

'"The most prominent feature ol the market
latt wtsk was the activity In epct Prunes,
orders being numerous and coming from all
quarters, but !n mest case: being for such
quantities aÂ« ere nÂ»eded for present use. The
\u25a0wide distribution Is materially aid<Â»d by the
â¢ scarcity and high price of evapor&tefl apples,
and this !& exs>ected to have a \u25a0till more pro
- nounced Influence &s the consuir.icg scaeon
proprÂ«?sse3. SjÂ»ot price* have an upward tend
ency and are an eighth to n quarter of a cent
a pound higher than at the bt-gl'nnlng of the
-T.eck. Few if ar.y orders are jrolng out to the
coast at present, but the feelings there 16 very
etror^r. as stocks ere very light. Not- much
dtmand for Aprioots or Peaches, fithfr on the
*pot or for shipment from the coast. Is to be
quoted at preeent. but supplies are limited and
the market la firm. New ouslness In bcth
California and Imported Rabins Is confined
almost wholly to Bales from second hands. The
latter are rather eaey. but not Quotably lower.
Buyers look for a break in the price of coast
Raislr.s after the turn of the year, and same
Cj think Jt may come Â»ooner. Consequently they

Hay and Feedstuff*.
Dealers here were disappointed at the light
ness of the rain, which promised well at the
start, but did not keep up. Yesterday's mar
ket was very steady at the old prices. Scott &
Magner's circular eaya: \u25a0.
"Receipts of Hay for the past six days on
the San Francisco market have been 2474 tons.
This is considerably less than usual, but never
theless It has-been enough to supply the de
mand. The bulk of arrivals continue to come
by water, and consist of the poorer and medium
varieties. There does not appear to be any
"let up" to the car shortage, and, therefore,
arrivals by railroad have Deen exceeding light.
The general demand for May In the city Is
comparatively light, and It may be expected to
continue In this way until after the holiday
season. Consumption of baled Hay throughout
the Interior is very heavy, and will tend to ma
terially reduce tome of our surplus stock.' The
export trade continues quite moderate.*
"The United States Government will receive
bids in a few days at Portland, Seattle and
San Francisco for about 2500 tons ol Hay for
export to Manila. Whether any part or all of
this order will be obtained by California or
not remains to be seen. Choice Wheat Hay,
Of which only a few cars have come In -during
the week, have sold readliy""at topmost quota
tions; Fancy Tame Oat Hay has also been In
light supply. The medium classes of Wheat and
Wheat and Oat Hay move slowly at from *10
612 per ton here. Alfalfa Hay Is in good de
mand, and arrivals sell o.t readily at firm fig
ures. The market la strong throughout. Straw
arrivals l>ave been heavier than the market re
quired, and the reeling is a little easier, par
tlclarly on No. 2 article, although choice
Straw is also a little easier."

Poultry, and Game.
Receipts of Poultry were unusually heavy for
Saturday, but the markei remained firm, as
leading retailers were stocking up for the holi
day trade, and desirable offerings of all kinds
of fowle found prompt sale at stiff prices. A
car of Western, the fourth for the week, was
on sale and the receipts from domestic polntH
consisted of 46 coops of live stock and 35 cases
of ttressefl Turkeys. All indications point to a
firm and active market during the coming

Butter, Cheese and Eggs.
; Eggs made a sensational break of -7^40 per
dobzen on the Exvchange yesterday, with deal
ers freely predicting still lower prices during
the coming week. The cause of the break was
thÂ« rain light though It was, softer weather
and increased receipts, with the general ex
pectation of steadily increasing supplies from
now on. Nobody wants to hold ranch Eggs
now at the current high prices, which must
surely break In the near future. The decline
in the medium grades was comparatively slight,
for they have not been unreasonably high, as
have fresh ranch.
There was no change worthy of note In But
ter or Cheese. Both continued in light supply
and in fair demand.
Transactions on the Exchange were about the
heaviest thus far since the Exchange was es
tablished, as follows:
Butterâ Five boxes California fresh ex

Deciduous and Citrus Fruits.
- There was very little doing. In fresh fruits
yesterday, but a firm feeling prevailed In
Oranges and Apples, with all dealers expecting
a firm and active market during the coming
week. Stocki of fancy Apples were rather
light there being an actual scarcity of high
grade offerings of. the red varieties, such aa
Spltzenbergs and Baldwins. Oranges were
plentiful, fully 5 carloads being received dur
ing the day. but the proportion of large fruit
in the receipts â¢ continued light. The other
Citrus fruits were plentiful, but steady at the
old quotations. Receipts of Strawberries were
15 che*te a larga amount, considering the time
of the year, but the Berries were very poor,
and practically unsalable. Grapes, too, were
mostly poor and slow of sale. Previous prices
ruled for all other fruits. \

E. F. WOODWARD IS NAMED
FOR PORT SURVEYOR.
Nomination by the
President Sent
to Senate.
Spear to Step Out
After a Long
bervice.
Gossip of Coming
Campaign in
Dispatches from Washington. D. C,
announce that the President has nomi
nated E. F. Woodward for Surveyor of
Customs, port of San Francisco, vice Jo
eeph S. Spear Jr., term expired. Senator
Perkins was the moving: spirit in the ap
pointment of the Sonoma State Senator,
although the Junior Senator, Frank P,
Flint, acquiesced. Mr. Spear was highly
indorsed for reappointment by many
tnerchants, bankers and business men of
Ean Francisco, but as he had held the
office for eight years the senior Senator
deemed a change advisable.
. Edward F. Woodward was born at Dv- j
A tuque, lowa, January 1, 1552. He came to j
California in 1554 and received his educa- :
lion In the public schools of this State.
He has resided in Oroville, Sacramento.
Placerville, San Francisco and Oakland.
In ISS3 he removed to Santa Rosa. He
was city treasurer of Santa Rosa two
terms,' Mayor of the city two terms and
treasurer of Sonoma County two terms.
He^was elected to the State Senate,
Eighth Senatorial District (Sonoma Coun
ty). November 4, 1902. In his capacity as
State Senator he voted to elect Perkins
and Flint to the United States Senate.
He is secretary of the Republican State,
Committee, having been chosen for that
lK>sition at the beginning of the last
Presidential campaign. He is regarded as
a high-class man of integrity and ability*
The undercurrent of gossip in political
camps leads to the opinion that the State
campaign of 1306 will be decidedly . inter
esting. It is already known 'that Santa
<_'ruz will put" in a strong bid for the priv
ilege of entertaining delegates to the Re
publican nominating convention. Sacra
mento, it is Bald, will make an active con
test to hold its prestige* as a convention
city. The convention will. assemble inthe
latter part of August or early in Septem
ber. 1.11 .1 * ' > '
TOO MAST ELECTIONS.
Under the old consolidation act San
Francisco had an "off year" from poli
tics, but under the new charter every
year brings on a political flght. - The
regular election and the preliminary . pri
mary contest make two elections-annu
ally. In Presidential years there is a
May primary in addition to the August
primary and the general election In No
vember. When the voters are not voting
yiey are organizing and raising money for
JH iimpaign expenses. The burden on the
Vaxpayers has become so grevious that a
constitutional amendment to diminish the
number of elections is strongly favored.
In Alameda County also an "off year'\
in politics is not known. As soon as the
ballots of one election are counted prep
arations are made for the next contest.
Alameda County is the dwelling place
of very many Federal office-holders of
high rank, and when State and local af
fairs of a political character are not
agitated the bestowal of Government po
sitions engages attention of the electors.
Jt follows, therefore, that there Is always
â¢something doing" in Oakland.
The politicians are now wondering
x* nether the Republican convention of 1906
Â«t Santa Cruz or Sacramento will give
Alameda County three important places
on the ticket. It is common rumor that
Governor Pardee expects renomination.
It is known that Justice' Hall will be a
formidable candidate for retention on the
Court of Appeals. Justice Henshaw may
decide that an extension of his career as
an Associate Justice ""of the Supreme
'\u25a0 Court would be acceptable.
Word cornea from Santa Rosa that
Judge A. G. Burnett would not object to
a nomination on the Republican ticket for
Associate Justice of the Supreme Court
to succeed F. W. Henabaw or William G.
Ixirigan. The latter was appointed to
mi the nnexpired term of Jackson Tem
ple deceased. Superior Judge Oater of
Bali Bernardino County is also on the list
'jf those who would not decline .' the
Aionor of service on the Supreme bench.
COMMISSION VACANCIES, c
It is expected that Governor "', Pardee
will soon appoint some one to fill the
vacancy on the Board of Bank CommiÂ»
tioners caused by the resignation of
Zoeth S. Eldredse. In March next the j
term of John D. Mackenzie, Harbor Com
missioner, will expire. There Is 1 no lack
of candidates for this place.
The term of J. H. Wllkins of the State
Board of Prison Director* will expire on
the 12th ot next month. The Republican
County Committee of Marin County, has
indorsed Editor Pryor as the man to suc
ceed Editor Wllkins. \u25a0 :
There is a deal of whispering in local
political circles regarding the organiza
tion of the Board of Supervisors. The
members of the beard were elected on the
Union Labor ticket, and the contention is
made that the party should be hÂ»ld re
sponsible for the administration of local
affairs. There Is a suspicion that Ruef
wants to organize the board as an auxili
ary branch of his law office and thus di
rect all the local legislation. Several of
the Supervisors are said to be bitterly
opposed to the execution of Ruers pro
gramme, but It \u25a0is intimated that they
have not the courage to flght the boss to
the finish, although they . are impressed
nlth the belief that the board. should de-*
clare its Independence of Ruef.

ADMIRAL WHITIXG
DISCUSSES HAZING
Says System Has Changed
Little Since Time He At

KANSAS CITY, Dec. 1 16.â Admiral "W. H.
Whiting, retired, arrived In the city to
day : with hi* family to visit his sister.
Mrs. E. 1 R. Atwell, wife of Bishop Atwell.
Asked about the reports of the hazing at
Annapolis, Admiral Whiting said:
w'rWell. I've read those stories about the
hazing at the old schoolâ you know I was
In ,the class of 'to-f-but I don't see .wnere>
the sxstem has changed a great deal from
what It was in those days. Of course,
where a oersori Is hazed ) to the point of
maiming It is to be deprecated but as
far as the fishts are concerned It seems
square i enough. As a matter of fact. I
believe that better code of flÂ«htlng exists
m the v naval academy than any other
college In the country.
'VI .always figured out this way, that a
man who /"couldn't" defend himself
wouldn't be much good In fighting for
some one else or. for; his country If -need
be. -I've seen many, of those school fights
and ; did /"not see any i ser lous results. In

In Cblrago ?Inke Important An
nouncement to Customers.
CHICAGO. Dec. 36.â A number of the
largest grain and commission houses
In the city to-day informed their cus
tomers that after to-day they would
refuse to deal in "bids" and "offers."
Ever since the practice of dealing in
*puts" and "calls" has been prohibited
by law. a number of houses have been
handling "bids" and "offers." which in
a large measure ' have usurped the
place of the former privileges. The
dealings in "puts" and "calls" will,' it is
expected by brokers in- this city, be
transferred to Milwaukee, and as a re
mit there was to-day a decided In
?rease in the prices of memberships on
the Milwaukee Board of Trade.

VALUABLE DIAMOND RISC
STOI.EX FROM CHICAGO MAN
Drops It on Floor In Board of Trade
Rooms and Lounger Picks
It Up aad Ram Off.
CHICAGO, Dec. 16. â A $1500 diamond
ring dropped to the floor of the Board
of Trade yesterday as one member was
handing It to another. A search of two
hours, in which nearly 20 board mem
bers and employes participated, proved
futile, and no trace of it was found.
The loser, W. W. Bo yn ton, had shown
the ring to Byron Roberts, who, after
admiring it, returned it to him. In
some way the ring dropped.
After the loss became known one of
the loungers in the lobby remembered
he had seen a man stoop to the floor a
few feet away and then walk leisurely
out of the building, but could. give no
description of him. ;v; v \u25a0<':'

a Christmas Dinner for some less fortunate friend.
These Turkeys wfll be priced so low, you can well
afford to buy two.
A Suit of Clothes, warm Underwear, half a dozen
pairs of Stockings, or a Merchandise Order with which
the recipients can make their own selection. AD would
be gifts thankfully received.

Rausch and his wife disagreed over a

that he would beg his wife's forgiveness
and make overtures for, peace.
This morning Rausch told his wife that

"Christmas shopping ; is a pleasure
when you know-where to go," a lady
was saying to her friend in the car. "I
always like to give slippers; there's
nothing any one appreciates more, and
a man will simply be tickled to death
with such a present. I find . buying
them easy. I have been getting them
for years at 'Kaufmann's,' 832 Market
street, and every year I find more and
prettier styles and prices much more
reasonable than anywhere else. This
store has more holiday slippers for
men, women - and children l than any
other store in San Francisco and as
many as several together. \u25a0
"The styles you see thereare not the
usual and ordinary slippers; they are
in original and tasteful designs and
look very different from what you're
accustomed to 'in other stores. And
then 'Kaufmann's' make : it a point |to
always have something novel and
unique. I bought some real buckskin
moccasins and some nice warm slumber
slippers to wear in bed. You can't get
these things anywhere ' else, .; and both
are so handy to have about. .And "my
children never want :to: go another

PHTSICTAN WHO HAS MADE BOMB
REMARKABLE DISCOVERIES IN
HIS STUDY OP THE BLOOD.
STUDY OF BLOOD
HIS SPECIALTY
Wonderful Discoveries Made
by Dr. Paul Uhlenhutli of
German Army Medical Staif
Special Dispatch to The Call.'
BERLIN, Dec. 16.â Dr. Paul Uhlen
huth of the German array medical staff
and professor of the University, of
Greifswald, knows more about " blood,
probably, than any other man living 1 .
He has made it /his specialty and has
pursued the study of It with Teutonic
thoroughness. Before he began his re
searches it ivas possible to ascertain by
chemical analysis whether what ap
peared to the layman a dark, red
eplotch merely was blood or paint or
some other stain. But science halted
there. After ; determining that it was
blood, except when it was compara
tively fresh, it could not prove conclu
sively whether it was' human or animal
blood. . Dr. Uhlenhuth has discovered
how that can be determined with abso
lute certainty. "He goes further than
that. He can tell what kind of animal
the blood comes ' from, even though
weeks, months and even years have
elapsed since It was shed.
The blood which pursues Its life-giv
ing course through. our veins is an al
buminous, solution, In which an im
mense number of red and white corpus
cles, visible only with a microscope, are
suspended. The blood " corpuscles of
men and animals, under powerful mi
croscopic examination, reveal certain
minute differences, but when the blood
has dried; as -Is- almost Invariably the
case when it becomes a . subject of
criminal Investigation, these differences
cannot be traced. But besides the cor
puscles,'blood contains still other char
acteristic substancesâ the' albuminous
matter. By infinite pains and labor Dr. j
Uhlenhuth .has ascertained that these
albuminous substances differ in differ
ent sorts of blood, and, that these dif
fer enccs can ]be I proved even after the
blood has been dried up for decades and
even mixed with various other mate
rials. . .i.- .".-\u25a0>.- . .. ..- :\u25a0 \u25a0 - . k ; r.': r :
It : would take too long to describe in
detail how' he j does this. His Investiga
tions are ibased i on biological " serum re
search. He Injected hen's blood into rab
bits and the, serum of . the rabbits "so
treated produced, when added to a solu
tion of the albumen of hen's eggs, a slight
turbidity only after a considerable period,
whereas in a thin varnish-colored solution
of hen's blood it at once "produced a
strong sediment This experiment proved

HURLED FROM
HIGH WINDOW
BY HUSBAND
Mrs. W. J. Kenney Declares
Spouse Attempted Murder
When She Refused His
Offers ' of Reconciliation
STILL TALKS, THOUGH *
JAW IS FRACTURED
Miraculously Escapes Death
in Fall of Five Stories
From the United States
Hotel to a Roof Below
/Last night W. . J. Kenney, a private
detective, called on his wife, from whom
he had been separated six months, in
an attempt to affect a reconciliation. The
reconciliation did not take place. In
stead, Mrs. Kenney, according to her ver
sion, "was pitched out of the sixth-story
â¢window of her room in the United States
Hotel at Sixth and Market streets, where
the fond interview, was taking place,' by
her insistent husband.- "â¢
It was 9 o'clock on Market street with
the Saturday night parade in full blast,
and the 'holiday crowds were treated to
the rather rare sight of; a whirling body
descending with cannon-ball speed'along
the facade of the building. The body was
picked up on the roof \u25a0of ; the Waflle
Kitchen,'. five whole floors from the win
dow through which it had come, and
â¢miraculously enough, it was found to be
full of life. Rushed to the Central Emer
gency Hospital Mrs. Kenney was dis
covered to be unhurt outside of a frac
tured Jaw and a^ broken arm. Mrs. Ken
ney was also found to be somewhat the
worse from liquor, which may explain
the extraordinary. safety of her flight.
The injuries of Mrs. Kenney were com
paratively so slight that she Vas willing,
nay, eager, to talk. She was not compli
mentary to her husband and ' was cate
gorical in her denunciations. She said
that she was Â£2 years old, that: she had
been married to W. J. Kenney a'.; year,'
and separated from lilm : for the last six
months. She had a room at the United
States Hotel, Sixth and Market, while
ho lived his solitary life at the Metro
politan Hotel on Third street '
Last night he called on her to affect a
reconciliation. A preliminary survey^ of
each other's grievances, begun merely
with the intention of finding a solution of
the question, drifted into a bitter reca
pitulation, then into mutual denunciation,
followed by bodily contact. "He grabbed
me by' the hair and the arm," said Mrs.
Kenney at her cot in. the hospital, "and
partly a pu|hed me,-? partjy^carried. me to
the window. ~Theri he grabbed me around
the waist and threw me out.. I didn't
know anything for a while and woke jup
in the ambulance." * ? .."'-'â¢\u25a0â¢\u25a0â¢
Kenney, the husband, who is accused
of this singular effort at peace-making,
was not found in the room from the win
dow of which Mrs. Kenney had plunged
to the street. Detective O'Day, at a late
hour last night, .was investigating the
case.
AGE PENSIONS
TO BE GRANTED
Special DlspatcÃ" to' Ttit Call.
CALL BUREAU, POST BUILD INO,
WASHINGTON, Dec. 16.â As a result of
preliminary steps taken; to-day. Congress
may retire and . pension 'all civil service
employes over 70 years of age. President
Roosevelt's declaration in pension order
No. 78 that a man's usefulness is half over
at 62 and that he Is entitled to the maxi
mum pension at 70 is to be applied by the
Appropriations Committee' of the^ House
to the civil employes of the Government.
The President was asked by resolution
of the House to-day to inform that body
what number of civil" employes in all
branches of the Government are 70 years
old or over. This list will then be labeled
"The Civil Pension List of ,the Govern
ment," 'the product of the present civil
service system.
Tawney/ the- new, chairman .of the Ap
propriations Committee, brcjught the, reso
lution Into the House Just before adjourn
ment to-day and asked for r lts '-'lmmediate
consideration. . Iti reading .started a ; half

meant. ' ' \u25a0 - v. . : .-. ; : \u25a0 . \u25a0 \u25a0 â¢ v
"It - simply ' means, - replied Tawney,
"that .-. the. clvir service system 'seems to
"be an excellent "means of: getting lnto.th'e
Government service,' but that It also Is an
.effectual - preventive for \u25a0 ever becoming
separated â¢ from \u25a0 ' the : Government - ' pay
roll.'" . .
Tawney explained that his committee,
in making up the legislative, executive
and Judicial appropriations j bill, ~ expected
to make a thorough examination; of this
subject. The President' had been ap
plied to for the ' reason that \u25a0he was a
civil service reformer, and was also in
, a position to \u25a0 obtain : the data , at the
earliest moment. "The information _ : he
gives \u25a0 will , be. followed by. further i Inquiry
as to .details, and tyie~ first* steps ; toward'
reform are tb^be 'taken. ' \\l;. \u0084._, ,

The Coaiqne marks a departure in'

confined to works of the purely classic
and earnest type. The ' new home of
music, which occupies a commanding
position on the banks of the Spree, at
the northern end of . the Friedrichs
etra6se, will be deroted specially to
presenting- operatic novelties. The new
works of Italian, French and German
composers will be presented in it In
Germany for the first time.
The first night't attraction will be
Massenet's "Le Jongleur, de '\u25a0 Notre
Dame,' 1 to be followed by Leoncavallo'B
"La Boheme," for which the Italian
maPFtro wilt come to Berlin.
* Miss Behne has been engaged as the
new opera's leading contralto. She is
a pupil of Arthur Claasen, director of
the New York Liederkranz, and made
her first public appearance in America
at Carnegie Hall with Walter Dam
rosch. Later she toured the country
with Sousa.
Through the patronage of William
Steinway Miss Behne came to Europe
to perfect herself for, opera, and has
studied principally at Berlin with
Madame Ross and Reinhold Hermann.
For the past five years she has sung at
various municipal operas in German
cities, achieving .success at important
points like Magdeburg. Brunswick,
Breslau and Halle. Miss Eehtie has also
been heard at Covent Garden, London,
in the "Meistersinger." the "Walkuere"
and "Gotterdammerung."
She is blor.de, tall and erect, combin
ing a remarkably fine stage presence
with real dramatic talent. At the con
clusion of her new Berlin contract Miss
Behne will return to her native land
to devote the balance of her career to
Hinging before American audiences.

RED BLUFF FORGER
Tried and Convicted After
Being Fugitive for
Four Years.
RED BLUFF, Dec. 16.â The trjal of C. O.
Fletcher, charged with forgery, which has

on a legal technicality, only to be fol
lowed more relentlessly than ever until
his arrest a few months ago. Fletcher,

full for the money paid him and then
sent" In to his employers notes alleged to
be signed by the purchasers.

REPLICA OF FAMOUS
CHURCH FOR HUB.
Boston May. - ' /Use : Edifice in English
Namesake for a Model.
FAMOUS CHURCH" IN CITY IN GREAT BRITAIN FROM WHICH BOSTON RE
CEIVED ITS NAME AND WHICH WILL BE USED AS A' MODEL FOR A
CATHEDRAL IN THE HUB. - .. - \u0084 :=; '7 : U

LONDON, Dec. 1 \u25a0 16.â Boston folk, the
people who dwell \u25a0 In the drowsy little
English Boston, in Lincolnshire.' are
greatly pleased by the tidings .that
their parish church of"SE~Bstblph may
serve" as a" m'oder f or ' the"pr6jected ca
thedral to' be erected -fin -the American
Boston. The two things they are
proudest ; of ! _are 'their old 'church /and
their maternal relationship to their big
MaÃÃachusetts* '\u25a0'\u25a0, namesake established
by their Puritan -ancestors.; .. .
The â¢ Rev. George Wolf e Shlnn. from
the latter place, has: been visiting , the
Lincolnshire town recently, to get some
idea how a modern St. "Botolph; would
look at the "Hub of the Universe." If
he is at all susceptible' to flattery he
will certainly take back with him a
favorable report. ;' .; â¢ , *
St. Botolph's is a , particularly fine
specimen of old ecclesiastical architec
ture. It measures', 283 by 99 feet and
is one of the largest churches; without
transepts in all England. Its most im
posing ; feature is \u25a0\u25a0 the which
rises to : a .helghtr of -\u25a0 263 ; feet and 'dom
inates the landscape j f or. r miles 'around I
It terminates in 7, an "octagonal*. lantern
and was ;- doubtless * Intended f by the
builders to serve , as/ a- llghthoupe by
land and sea as well as a 'ca,mpanile.
The country .folk : have affectionately
dubbed It "The Stump.". . - - "- â¢ '? '

THE UNION OIL CO.
OF CALIFORNIA
Its Wonderful Development,
Tremendous Output and
Fleet of Tank Steamers
i. The United produced during
1904 .73 per; cent; of the world's output
of - petroleum; of this percentage Cali
fornia provided 25 [per cent, being. more'
than that contributed* by any other
State. ... Foremost In the producing,
handling and marketing, of California
petroleum stands the Union Oil - Com
pany of California, \u25a0 which is practically
the pioneer of -the Industry in f this
State. Starting some twenty odd years*
ago with; meager land holdings, an ex
ceedingly limited production, and few
facilities V for handling, :the-. company
now owns over 170,000 acres of oil ter
ritory, its production is unlimited, and
it owns and operates the largest fleet of
efficient" tank steamers, in the world.
Most of the company's land is near tide
water, which it reaches by pipe lines at
three pointsâ San Pedro. Ventura and
Port ;. Harf ord. ./\u25a0 These lines serve as
feeders to the company's oil carriers. -; .
,The company not only supplies, the
local market, but' is constantly reach^
- ing out ', f or.^ ne w â¢ markets, at ' present
supplying consumers at the Hawaiian
Islands, : Central . and \u25a0 South America, as
well as British Columbia. The use of
crude oil for ; fuel purposes is practi-.
cally in its. infancy; and there is no
doubtvthatin a few. years It will be
common practice in all parts .of the
world. The Union Oil Company, having
unlimited quantities of oil. with its fleet
of tank carriers, is in ideal position to
prosecute the introduction of fuel oil In
new. markets, and is rapidly. doing so.
The* company; has two refineries, lo
cated .at Oleum and Bakersfield, Cali
fornia. W Although the largest and best
equipped; plants of this character in the
State,- plans -are about completed by
which their capacity will be increased
many times.: Both refineries are ideally
placed" for "making prompt.' economical
shipments. The \u25a0. Bakersfleldi refinery is
located ; on the main line of the South
ern, Pacific Railway Company, s wbJle at
Oleum the - same j railroad runs directly
through > the 'plant, and., this .refinery
being situated on. the Bay, of San t'ran
cisco." the company has put up a wharr
capable of docking any sized vessel
afloat' From these two refineries.' which
produce all; kinds of refined oils, as.weh
as \u25a0 asphaltum. known ;as "the 'Maltha
brand," shipments are made to all parts
*For the distribution of Its-oil in Cali
fornia,' the i company has seventeen " sta

HUMMEL TRIAL
HOLDS INTEREST
Witness Testifies to; Bather
. Peculiar Proceedings in
the First Divorce Suit
MOESE ON THE STAND
Banker Says the; Defendant
Told Him That Annulment
Case Was Corrupt and Bad
NEW YORK, Dec. 16.â The crucial !
legal point In' the celebrated Dodge-Morse I
divorce case, namely, .the question wheth- j
er Dodge was ever served .with the : sum- \u25a0\u25a0
mons to divorce proceedings, .with his
wife, who later became Mra. Morse, was
taken up to-day at the trial of Abraham
Hummel, the lawyer, for conspiracy In
this case. The first ' witness, W. A. ;
Sweetser, was the lawyer who represent
ed Mrs. Dodge In her divorce proceed- \\
inea.
Sweetser testified . that he served the
summons in question on Dodge on March
31, 1597, at the. Everett House in this city.
He then said in reply to questions that in
1903 be identified as Dodge a man whose
real name was- Herbitch. '. This was at
reference proceedings' in connection with
the case. ., The prosecution in the Hum
mel trial' has charged that Herbitch was
used st the reference to impersonate
Dodge, who, they : charge, was being kept
away from the city. . . . *
Sweetser said Mrs. podge was to pay
all expenses of the divorce' proceedings,
including her husband's counsel fees.
Charles K. Herbitch, whom Sweetser
testified he identified as Dodge in 1903,
was then put on the witness stand. He
said that he went to the reference pro
ceedings in Question at the request of
Hummel. ..
"I went to his office," testified Herbitch,
"and he told me wanted to use me
for about fifteen minutes at a hearing
but did not want me to testify. He sent
me to Judge Hall's office at 62 ."Williams
street. Hummel afterward entered the
office with Steinhart."'.
ADMITS POSIXG AS DODGE.
"Did you receive anything for * your
services?"
"Yes, $25."
"What did Hummel say to you?"
"He. told me that he wanted to see
if a certain man would ' mistake me
for some one else."
"You knew by what you heard there
that there was a dispute as to the serv
ice of a summons?"
"I did."
Justice Rogers, who is trying the.
case, asked at this point: "And when
Sweetser greeted you as Dodge did you
not make any response?''
"I did not."
Charles W. Morse,- banker and or
ganizer of the American Ice Company,
was next called to tho witness stand.
It was in order to secure an annulment
of the marriage of Mrs. Clemence
Dodge to Morse that the alleged con
spiracy was entered into by Hummel.
Morse testified that Hummel told
him in 1902 that Mrs. Dodge's divorce
from Dodge was corrupt and bad.
Morse said he answered that if any
thing was wrong he wanted it * set
right/ The witness said that'Sweetser
showed him a newspaper picture of
Dodge, which the witness said he had
with him when he ' served the sum
mons. Delancey Nicholl, Hummel's at
torney, then said: ; \u0084:,,..
UNCLE OPPOSED MARRIAGE.
"And when you called his attention
to the fact that by the date on the
paper the picture \vas not printed un
til months after the service of the sum
mons what did he say?"
"That he would have to frame up
some other excuse/ 1 was the reply.
Morse. testified that his wife said she
preferred a new divorce from. Dodge
and that she had started nn action for
one. He said that Hummel was to act
as Dodge's counsel in this new divorce,
but the case was stopped by interven
tion proceedings.
Morse was asked about the attitude
of his uncle, Captain James T. Morse,
the' Ne-w England ship owner, regard
ing the marriage with Mrs. Dodge.
."You. have heard him say that Mrs.
Dodge v.*as an unfit woman for you to
marry?" he was asked.
"Yes."
"You have heard him say also that
he would take steps to break your
marriage?" ' . ,
"Yes."
Morse said . that he was in District
Attorney Jerome's office and that
Jerome .was . .present . when Captain
Morse said he had taken legal steps to
break tho marriage. . .. ..
Judge Ernest Hall, who acted as ref
eree in the Dodge. divorce case in; 1903,
testified that Sweetser took Herbitch
for Dodgeat one of the hearings and
that he afterward understood that Her
bitch was there simply that It might
be known whether Sweetser would rec
ognize him as Dodge. . Judge Hall said
that Dodgo himself was present at a
later meeting and that he did not at all
resemble Herbitch in appearance. .- ThÂ«
case was then adjourned until Monday.

MONTANA JUDGE
BECOMES IRATE
Brands the : Jurors Serving
in His Court as Cowards
and Orders Their Discharge
BUTTE, Mont., Dec. ] 16.â Branding the
juiors as i cowards afraid to do as they,
had sworn and soÂ« permitting crime ,to'
rule with a high hand in Butte with the
result that murder follows murder and
holdup follows holdup with appalling fre
quency, Judge * Michael Donlah : of . the
criminal branch of the District Court 'has
summarily discharged, the entire jury
panel with \ a .caustic scoring eeldom
heard in any courtroom.
The climax was reached when the jury
failed to reach a verdict in the Gordon
highway robbery, case." In which the de
fendant had been identified as the robber
almost beyond 1 the possibility of a doubt.
This disagreement is about the sixth in
criminal cases this term, four ' occurring
in first degree rourder'trials in which tfie
evidence was apparently overwhelmingly
in favor of the State. ; Several days ; ago
Judge Donlan was nearly taken off his
feet with surprise when , the jury in the
Hill gambling case " returned to him and
politely Informed his \ Honor f that â¢ unless
he coul,d reduce the $500 fine imposed by
the statutes, although they ; believed :.tRe
defendant guilty,;they would acqult.htm,
which they I did upon '. being Informed | by
thpJudge that tie could not alter the, laws
of the State. Then came the acquittal oÂ£
Pat Rogers, charged "with killing Harry
Richards, whom he; shot dead, while ; he
(Rogers) was out gunning for, a saloon
keeper : who had" thrashed him during a
drunken brawl. 'This \u25a0 saloon-keeper later
killed a man and was tried 'for murder in
the first" degree.' but; as the jury failed to
arrive at a; verdict the .liquor man was
also -.set: at 'llberty.rv ..; v Â£..*; v.; ; ; . :
When the : jury; in the. Gordon case re
ported that* they were ; unable ; to agree
Donlan'B Ire knew.no bounds, and, with a
face almost livid :,with indignation he; told
the jury that' criminal trials had become
a farce in" Butte 1 arid -\ the: brunt:-.; of g all
jokes. In the course of his remarks the
court-said: Â» ; - ; '\u25a0\u25a0 .' ii
"Butte' is becoming the Mecca for tha
criminals of America.; ,It> is up \ to, the
jury to stop these: flagrant .infractions of
the laws. -H' demand the services' of /a

HARNEY CHARGED
WITH FORGERY
Municipal Contractor Will

A warrant for the arrest of J. G. Har

charge of forgery is the outcome of a
neighborhood quarrel over the paving of
Thinl avenue, between Clement street

\u25a0was sworn out yesterday morning before

For the comfort of the guests the lobby^ is to be refitted and Otis elevaiorsinstaUed; For the^

WEINEKE & PLAGEMANN - - - Propite
tatlng the matter In the neighborhood; Is
that Harney signed the name of John
ston to a petition addressed to the Board
of Works, asking that the section of
Third avenue above mentioned be paved.
In pursuance of the petition, the board
voted the contract to Harney, who pro
ceeded to go ahead with the work.
When the contract was announced it is
said another contractor came to the resi
dents on the block and offered to pave
the streets for a less cost to the pronerty
owners. Desiring to break the agree
ment with Harney, the people in tne
neighborhood framed a protest to the
Board of Works, asking it to rescind the
contract. The board failed to agree on
the question of stopping Harney in the
work and left the matter undecided, and
Harney continues his preparations to
pave the streets.
Inquiry in the neighborhood failed to
reveal any great number of property own
ers who opoose the paving of the street
and in many Instances the action !j of
Johnston is attributed to a personal mo
tive, as he is also a contractor doing
street work.

GOVERNMENT
CONDEMNS COWS
Cattle on ;Angel; Island- Are
Suffering From Advanced
Stage of Tuberculosis
MILK SAMPLES TAKEN
Six Quarts Sent to a City
Chemist, Who Makes Re
port That Disease Prevails
Seventeen, head of cattle on Angel Isl-,
and have bÂ« en condemned by the medical
authorities ci the army, and orders have
been issued that they must be removed
from the island immediately. The author
ities have discovered that - j tuberculosis
exists on the ; island in the worst form,
and two cows have died from, it already,
while others j may die before they can be
taken away.
The disease was discovered several
weeki ago, and Dr. Richard B. Corcoran,
veterinary of the artillery corps at the
Presidio, was sent to Angel Island to
Investigate and make a report.' A thor
ough investigation was made and several
large - tubercular glands were cut -from
different cows and. examined by the com
bined : medical department of the \u25a0 post.
The condition was considered serious and
ten of the cows were immediately con
demned, and six quarts of their milk was
sent to San Francisco to be examined by
a chemist, who reported that the milk
was in a bad condition and not fit for
consumption. Upon further examination
it was decided to use condensed milk at
the post and condemn all the cattle In
pasture at the depot of recruits and cas
uals and thus prevent the spread of the
disease among the other cattle on the
island.
The condemned cattle are the property
of. F. Pearl, an old veteran of the Civil
War, who has supplied milk to the post
for the last twenty years and" who al
ways boasted that his milk would stand
a better test than any dairy around . the
bay.. There . is some doubt, however, as
to his boast applying to the health of the
cattle, for it Is now reported that they
have been condemned on several jj occa
sions and. were only permitted to remain
on the Island through some Influence
brought to Tbear upon the authorities.
His dairy would probably have never
been questioned but for the death of two
of his cowsr which caused a dispute be
tween the owner and the authorities as
to who should bury the animals. The re
cruits were finally sent out to do the
necessary work, and an investigation was
immediately begun as to the cause of the
death. - It . resulted -in the condemning ;of
all the cattle at the post. /.
The cattle were rounded up yesterday
and will be shipped from the island as
soon as the owner can get a suitable
pasture for them. As the officers as well
as the men at the poÃt are without fresh
milk Pearl may obtain permission to pur
chase new cows and still supply the post
with milk.
Pearl has had charge of ths water
works on the Island for over : twenty
years. He ran the dairy as a side line
and supplied the officers and men with
milk, in the latter case receiving . his
money from the company funds. -

onstrated that Electricity is the basis of human

/"All right; then can't you see that if Electricity

pie who are ailing?"
"Yes." \ . ..*,;,â¢.-
"And if I can restore this electricity I should
be able to cure them, should I not?"
"Yes, that seems reasonable."
"Well, now I have no more to say except that my
Electro-Vigor pours a volume of continuous current
into the nerve cells for hours every night while you
sleep. Thenerves drink it up, and it becomes a part
of the' nerve life. It is really so much added vitality,
and as all these troubles come from a loss of vitality,
the benefits that are derived are a natural result."
"I suppose," said the skeptical friend, "that your
treatment is especially for what are called 'weak
men,' or is it good for general troubles?"
"It is a tonic invigorant. It restores strength, cir-
culation and vitality, to every organ of the body. - It
is no' more a 'weak men' treatment than a stomach
treatment. It is tio more for men than for women.
It restores the vital energy that is needed by people
who are run down in any manner, and you know
that nearly every trouble that people have comes
from a want of sufficient vitaL force to keep up
health." I Â£

cannot be replaced. If my cells wear out I can at-
tach new cells in a few moments and the battery is
as good as ever.
--"I will give $1000 for one of my Electro- Vigor

Dr. Hall â Dear Sir: Electro-Vigor is the only cure
for rheumatism, and I am satisfied that no one suf-
fering: from that trouble can 'make a better invest-
ment than the purchase of one of your appliances.
I suffered' intense pain for two months before I
purchased your appliance, but went to work at my
trade as a carpenter within two weeks after I com-
menced the treatment. If there is anything I can
do to assist you in any way, to strengthen any suf-
ferer's faith in this treatment, do not hesitate to
call upon me. I will tell you that I took your treat-
ment against the advice of my friends and family.
who thought it on the same order as the usual run
of electric belts and treatments, but I have found
it very different, and will vouch for Electro-Vijor
at any time. Yours very truly,
TO R. CLARK.
"To chow how much better than vinegrar belts my
Electro-Vigor is, I will allow half of what was paid
for any vinegar belt in exchange for Electro- Vigor,
and I will guarante to give ten times the power of
any vinegar -belt on* the market.
"You can attach an Incandescent lamp to.Elactro-
Vigor and you will get a brilliant light. That shows
what power it has, and yet with the regulator this
power can be made as mild as you want It.
"I would like to show Electro-Vigor to any onÂ©
who will call and see it. and will give a free test."
-SEND FOR MY F3EE BOOK
Which explains all about "Electro-Vigor" and tells
why it Is better than old-style vineger belts. It Is the
most beautiful work that has ever been devoted to
electric treatment. It will interest you, and as It tells
you my story in an honest, plain and candid \u25a0 way I
think you will like me better for havinsr read It. X

CARNEGIE USED
IN SHAW PLAY
One of Characters in "Major
Barbara" Drawn From the
American Iron Master
DRAMA TIRES AUDIENCE
Action of Piece Ceases to
Give Way to a Discussion
.of Irrelevant Sub j ects
Special Dispatch to Th* C&IL
LONDON, Dec. 16.â 1t is no exaggera"
tion to say that a more expectant audi
ence has seldom gathered in a London
playhouse than that which crowded the
Court Theater for the first performance
of George Bernard Shaw's much heralded
new play, "Major Barbara." A feverishly
interested audience, and an uncommonly
brilliant one, too, . which included â¢A. J.
Balfour. the former Prime Minister; Sir
Oliver Lodge and Dr. Jameson, leader of
the famous raid, to name only the best
known of the many celebrities present.
And no wonder â¢ that 'JMajor Barbara"
was awaited with more than ordinary
curiosity, considering the extent to which
Shaw's work has dominated things of'
late. He has, of course, been more of a
figure than ever since the excitement in
the United States over "Mrs. Warren's
Profession," but before that the enormous
success of "Candida" and "Alan and; S
uperman" had made all the difference in
Bernard Shaw's standing as a dramatist.
Heretofore merely a brilliant faddist,
or a satirist whose lampoons were too
subtle to be intelligible, tne. tendency in
this country of late has been to acclaim
Shaw as a master mind, especially since
all the Intellectual world of London, head
ed by the King himself, went to see
"John Bull's Other Island." "What, then,
was the author's promised "discussion , In
three acts" to be like, to play; in â¢ which
Annie Russell was brought all - the way
from the United States?
CARNEGIE WJTH A TROMBONE.
Well, "Major Barbara" proves to be
much of a piece with "John Bull's Other
Island," which failed at home because
there was too much talk In it and too lit
tle play. Still, American, playgoers can't
but be diverted by the Spectacle of An
drew Carnesie tooting a trombone at the
head of a Salvation 'Army, squad. For
there is no doubt that the millionaire
manufacturer of fighting .machines in
Shaw's new play Is Mr. Carnegie,.and lest
there should be any question about this he
is named "Andrew Undershaft" and Louis
Cal vert, who plays . the part at the Court,
Is carefully made up as ' the Laird of
Sklbo. *
Another character, a whisuy manufac
turer, "whose product is advertised on thf
Thames embankment," is obviously Sir
Thomas Dewer. Annie Russell plays the
part of the capitalist's daughter, Barbara,
who has joined the army "because she
wants to do good," and Shaw*Â« theme, so
far as it can be discovered, is the struggle
between the father's and daughter's ' re
spective creeds, his being the cynical one
that money and force accomplish every
thing, while hers is an abiding faith in
Christian charity.
About these two creeds and about all
Shaw's other favorite themes there is talk
interminable/though it goes without Bay
ing that much of it is highly brilliant.
But Shaw has broken his word to us, and
broken it in an unexpected way. He
promised "a discussion in three acts," and
recently warned "romantic playgoers"
that he had "thrown them over com
pletely" in writing his ; new piece.
But "Major; Barbara" is not^ merely; a
discussion and romantic playgoers are not
thrown' over completely, and -it is just
this circumstance that Inclines one to be
lieve that the latest Shavian farrago . will
share the fate of "John Bull's Other
Island" when it is produced in the United
States. For there Is Just enough real
play and real character drawing in the
first two acts of "Major Barbara" to
pique our interest and rouse our antici
pation, and then comes the long-winded
debate about everything from university
education to how the poor live which to-;
ward the finish puts even the ardent
Shaw admirer perilously close to the
yawn.
Beside the stage Carnegie with his,
trombone we have a prpf essor of Greek
pounding a bass drum, also in the serv
ice of the Salvation Army. He is Major
Barbara's lover, who has joined the
Booth forces in order to be near, her, but
who : ultimately becomes .the manager of
the factory where, her. father's death
dealing missiles are turned out. There
is, It appears, a tradition, ln the Under
shaft family; that its head shall always
adopt a foundling as his business suc
cessor, and owing to Andrew. Undershaft's
insisting on following this rule arid .dis
inheriting his own son, he and his wife
have quarreled and separated several
years* before the play o.pens.
LONG , DISCUSSIONS VAT END.
The.Undershaft girls, however, Barbara
and Sophie," need .'wedding portions, so
the father' of .. the ;; house : is : summoned
back" and in the first ' act \we have ' him
calling: at; Lady" Britomart Undershaft's
house and being "Introduced" to hla own
daughters. Taken wlth'the: girl whose
religious tendencies : have â¢ led her; to be
coinfi &j major In the Salvation Army, the
millionaire proceeds to draw her . out,* and
here; there begins: the struggle ; between
Ihe two." Barbara- ia convinced .{t hat \u25a0 a"

LABORER LOSES
LIFE IN SEWER
Stephen Podesta Is Prowned
Like Eat While Working"
in Maiiliole on Fifth Street
Faulty methods pursued \u25a0 by the ' Board
of Public Work's seem to ;be responsible
for the death , yesterday of t Stephen Po
desta, a laborer employed by the city on
sewer work. Nothing was knowri of an
accident having "befallen the unfortunate
man \u0084 until fellow workmen found i his
drowned body in . a manhole/ on Fifth
street, between Howard and'Folsom. .The
body was discovered shortly before noon. c .
He had been seen at work about a'half
hour previously/IBjSHB9
-It is known that Podesta . went r down
into the manhole,* opposite 278 Fifth street.
He took some sacks with him for the pur
pose of making a dam for the water that
was in the sewer, and it' is ; believed that
haying been rendered unconscious '", by
sewer gas he fell Into the: sewer and was
drowned. No' one had been: put] on guard
at the manhole, as j there ,. should . have
been. "<sSSSHggBp
' J. Christiansen, Podesta's working part
ner, inquired of James Flaherty and Wil
liam Sheppard, ' who \. were a
manhole , opposite 318 'i Fifth street, 1 .what
had become .of Podesta;: Am > he . .was
speaking the : dead \ body? of , Podesta' float
ed Into view; i having j been ; carried 'about
half -a. block ;by^ the water, n.
' Podesta .was . a"; native of < Italy tj> 49 years
old." He resided vwlth* his \u25a0 wife " and fam

PARADES PARK SWARD
WITH NAKED FEET
While 'Obeying His Ph
Neurotic Patient ls Arrested.
He Tramples W^ewy Grass and Incidentally
Consumes Succulent Mushrooms. x
JAMES C. CRAWFORD
"With nether *\u25a0 limbs bared below the
knees and - pockets stuffed with fresh
culled mushrooms,' Lorenz- Valante, '* a
resident of Little Italy, -; stalked the' sward
of LobOÃ Park, In the North Beach, dis
trict, ; from, dawn- of yesterday,- until Ihe
was accosted, searched and arrested at 8
o'clock, a. m. .by Special Policeman A.
Gordon/ ':.'/' . - : '-" \u25a0'â¢".\u25a0-\u25a0 ..:;â¢'\u25a0':':
\u25a0 "Violating a park ordinance" was the
charge - booked' against : Slgnor \u25a0" Valante,
and when asked by Police Judge Fritz
to state more specifically the alleged
offense the prosecution claimed that it
vras two-foldâ purloining park property,
1. c., mushroomf, arid' ignoring the warn
ing conveyed by signboards which notified
visitors to keep off the y grass. To this
the defense retorted, first, that the
evanescent' quality of mushrooms, which
sprout, develop and naturally vanish
within a few hours unless they are gar-!
nered, makes them - ineligible for , legal
classification as "property;" j and, second,
the fact that' Lobos Park la intended for
public usage renders null. and .void, also
ridiculous and absurd, the attempted ex
clusion of the public from* any portion
of it.
Prior to . formally taking trie complaint
and the arguments 4 under ; advisement
until to-morrow the "Judge ' ascertained
from Slgnor "Valante '\u25a0' that 'the matutinal
promenade on the lawn and, the incidental
plucking of the; mushrooms? were pursu
ant to medical advice,; Slgnor Valante
had never heard of the Kneipp cure for
neurasthenia, but knew that he .was sub
ject to frequent spells -of ? nervous pros
tration, superinduced by the; brain-taxing
business of fruit peddling, and; that his
physician Instructed him to trample dewy
grass with bared fe*et and to consume all
the, edible fungi he could collect while
thus employed. As : he had given" the sug
gested remedy only an hour's trial when
the policeman interfered. ; he could not
testify as -to Its . efficacy,' but was â¢ still
of opinion that the doctor'- knew* what
he was talking about v when: the pre
scribed It. ' \u25a0".-\u25a0\u25a0 :': : -':v: ;^^ '":;.'. '\u0084 :-'\u25a0\u25a0-
"Well," said the court; "I* will give
myself up ; to careful consideration of the
law and equity; involved; in -.the case and
may be prepared to hand down a decision
Monday morning. In the meantime \u25a0 you
would better shun : Lobos Park."
Signor Valante, whose ; twitching mus
tache and restless hands ; did ' not ', belie

Timms, who informed -Judge '\u25a0 Conlan ' that
the defendant had ? falsely; - represented
himself to ' innkeepers in -the ' vicinity of

"And he's -not your cousin?" the" Judge
remarked, interrogatively. v ; '~ \u25a0;

claim of' blood relationship,'.' said his
Honor, glancing from*: the accused 'to the

I YOUNG WOMAN. WHOM CITY AT- j
TORNETT-En^ECT BURKE WILL I
APPOINT A X)E2Â»UTY. .... J
William G. Burke. Oity//Attorr.<y
vlect, yesterday afternoon gave out the
names of those who will assist him
; while he holds the position for the
next two years. The new appointees
are as follows: Howard Harron, A, S..
Newburgh, Daniel W. Burchard, John
T. Williams. W. T. Baggett, Albert T.
Roach and Miss Claribel David- Miss
Etta Block, the present stenographer,
\u25a0will be retained.
The appointments of Burke have
A een foreshadowed for . some time In
|v,-ery case save that of Miss- David.
This one comes, as a Burprise; as
well as a decided novelty. It is not
every city that can boast of a Portia
helping to guide the affairs in its legal,
department, and therefore . there is
unusual interest attached to the ap
pointment of Miss David. ..'.-.-'
Never before in the history of San
Francisco's municipal government has (
a woman been .selected to fill such- a
position. Therefore, Miss David enjoys
an unusual .distinction .among the
members of her. sex." However, she is ;
not unknown to the legal lights of the
city, having been a^ member 3f the bar i
for gome time. j
Helen Dare, the noted special writer
on the Call staff, wrote . a very inter- 1
rsting. interview with Miss -David some
v.opks ago. In which the talented
Portia told of varied experiences be-
Jore thr bar and how she managed to
lipcorac.a lawyer.' Miss David Is an
unusually talented young woman and
very well ver/fd on legal questions.
Rhr formerly studied at the Univer
sity of' California, taking a literary
Â« ourse. She was always Interested. In
ill* study of the law and when a mere
prirl *h<* used to read with Interest the
court n*Â»ws. In this way, ehe managed
to kindle ;i firo for legal learning which
burned with more rapidity as she pur
sued her studies.
IÂ« IiAW GRADUATE.
Miss David never studied law In, the
university. It was not till ; she; com
ted her studies; there and entered
tings Law College that she tackled
legal questions; ln^ earnest.' Then
studied : with a ".â¢ will. : Being nat
urally gifted with a liking for the law.
lior task was a pleasant one and! she
rapidly advanced, being graduated with
honors. . >
In telling Helen Dire ofher firÂ»?t expe-"^
rionce in a Police Court, Miss David said:
"1 knew . the mother of the young; man
whom I defended, and* I -wanted â¢ to help
her, for I ' felt â¢ sorry for \u25a0 her and " I ' was
anxious to do what I could to aid her.
VYou â¢ see, it \u25a0 was like this. The young
man, George . Howath, ; for '.whom I ap
peared \u25a0, seemed more - . unfortunate than
bad. He; isn't altogether bad. I think
that few. people : are really bad. i I thtnk
there is ; some good in every one if; we
know how "to" reach 'â¢ It. -W-hen he got into
trouble I thought I could help- him' to get
another chance, .and' l wanted : to hÂ§lp; his
mother, for I felt \u25a0 sorry for her. I took
the case.' ' r â¢ â¢ -. , \u25a0Â»â¢'; - \\~ ~ .
"Embarrassed? No, indeed; ' I ' did 'not
feel . embarrassed. , Why. should I be em
barrassed?. It, wasi- nothing. - It did -not
amount to muchâ just a*fe*w minutes'
work. And,'- besides/ I got *him out of
trouble. \u25a0 ': .. '
"I did not actually win the case. He
wasn't acquitted, you know. Only al
lowed to go on probation. But that's
better than nothing. ....
"Why, j-es, indeed, I would go* Into -the
Police Court again, though that.w as"* my
only; experience there. Why : not, %If - 1
â¢found some good reason ?-- If. I -saw. where
I could do some one some good,' why not?.
.."Yes, Indeed, I would take a criminal
case.. I have ; never done 6O yet because
I! never had one .offered to me. .But I see
no reason why a woman lawyer should
not. 'Very, of ten 'ln; looking over, the cases
In court ' I Â« see \ many â¢ reasons why t she
should. . I think that very, often where a
woman is Involved a woman lawyer could
get the facts '.much more easily than a
man. and present -them more Justly., I
can see no impropriety in a woman plead
ing for, a woman. Can you?" >

Backers of Jack O'Brien
VISITORS ARE EXPECTED
Xaiiy Spectators Will Wit
ness Last Public Work
out of Fighters To-Day
The. betting on the Fitzslmmons-O'Brien
fight had hardly assumed definite shape
yesterday, although the admirers of the
Cornlshman were backing him at the per
xailing odds of 10 to ' 7.
From the number of persons who favor
the ex-champion's chances it is expected
lie will pick up in the betting before Wed
nesday. Some doubt was cast on his
ability to stand the training when the
match was announced. These doubts
have vanished, as he has done air that
has been asked of him In his work.
O'Brien is a fighter who is always in
trim. He has had a slight setback in
sustaining an injury to his Ehin while
training recently. This will hardly affect
him, as once he warms <ip he will forget
all about it.
Fitzsimaions' manager. Leon Friedman.
Bays that his charge will not announce
his seconds until just before the battle
Wednesday evening. Fitz has been at the
glove game so many years and knows bo
much about fighting that It seems hardly
necessary for him to be fortified with
the advice of seconds, - but he will have
men in his corner who will know how to
quickly restore vim", vigor and vitality to
Fitz if he should be in want of -such
elements during the mill.
This afternoon Bob will appear for the
last time in public at his training quar
ters at Croll's Gardens in Alameda. He
will punch the bag and spar with Bates
and Chester, commencing at 3 o'clock.
In order* to prevent a throng from over
crowding his gymnasium an admission
fee will be charged to see the ex-cham
pion work out. Fitz had planned to fin
ish his training to-day, but for the pur
pose of keeping himself on edge he Is to
do light exercising in private to-morrow
afternoon. In the evening he will come
to this city to await the call to battle
Wednesday night. Fitz is confident that
lie is in winning fettle, and he sees noth
ing but victory as the result of his com
ing contest with O'Brien. Yesterday Bob
coxered eight miles of Alameda's streets
and in the afternoon banged the bag and
boxed' with his training mates for a full
twenty rounds!

WILL REPLAY
SUNDAY'S GAME
Hornet Footballers Offer to
â¢ Meet the Albion Hovers
Before the Season Ends
FOUR GAMES TO-DAY
Match Between Sacramento
and Santa Cruz Elevens
Postponed to Next/ Year
Four games of Association football
will be played to-day in this vi
cinity. The team just organized by
members of the Olympic Club will play
a practice match against an eleven of
Vampires on the ground at Webster
street,. Alameda, the ball being kicked
off at 11 a. m. The three other games
are regularly scheduled contests for
the championship of the California As
sociation Football League. \u25a0
I The most Interesting \u25a0 and probably
! the closest of these will be between the
! Albion Rovers and the Independents at
Freeman's Park, Golden Gate,, with C.
W. Irish as referee. The Rovers played
a strong game against the Oakland
Hornets last Sunday and the Independ
ents j won both the league champion
ship and the Union cup last season.
The Vampires will meet the' San Fran
cisco eleven on the ground at Webster
street. . Alameda, Arthur Robinson jfbe
lng the referee in the place of J. Frew,,
who was appointed to take charge of
the match, but is recovering from an
illness. The Oakland Horjiets and the
Alameda Eagles will play on the
ground at Seventh avenue and Califor
nia street, J. Cameron being the.ref-'
eree. In all the ' league matches the
ball will be kicked oft at. 2:30 p. m.
The match between the Santa Cruz
eleven and the Sacramento team, which
was scheduled to take place on the
cricket ground at Alameda to-day,
has been postponed to February IS of
next year, the Santa Cruz men being
unable to reach Alameda in time to
begin play/ at 12:30 p. ra. The post
poned match will', probably take place
at Freeman's Park. Santa Cruz beat
the Eagles three goals to one in last
Sunday's match at Alameda.
Last Sunday's match between the
Oakland Hornets, then standing at the
head of the league, and the Albion Ro
vers was an unusually keen one and
required a firm j and experienced ref
eree. The Rovers complained bitterly
cf the decisions of the referee and one
goal was denied them which many of
the best judges of the game who saw
the play believed should have been
awarded to them. But as a set-off
against this one goal was ; given to
them which probably ought not to have
been counted for them. < After-, the
match was over there was much talk
of the Rovers withdrawing from the
league, but all this has been set, at rest
by the generous offer of the Hornets to
replay the match, an offer which has
been accepted by the Rovers. In con
sequence of the Hornets giving up the
two points awarded to them by the ref
eree for last Sunday's match, the Vam
pires now stand at the head of the
league table 'with 10 points. To obtain
these, however, they have played six
games, while the Hornets have; played
only four games, all of which they have
won.
The Santa Cruz eleven scored for the
first time when they defeated the
Eagles last Sunday on the ground at
Alameda. The Independents, though
third on the list, have scored more
goals (21) than any other, team. The
Hornets' team was weakened in lasc
Sunday's match against the Rovers by
the absence of H. R. Elliot, the cap
lain and right fullback, and of Harry
Bird, one of the halfbacks. It became
necessary to bring Mackenzie from his
place at center forward into the' back
line, where he played an excellent
game, though he keeps closer to the
goal than Elliot. Christensen was hurt
early In the game' and McLachlan was
not in good condition. The Rover for^
ward line is excellent and keeps bom
barding the opponents' "goal, -but,*- with
its full strength In the field, the Hor
nets should gain a victory. The.Hor
net defense . is . so '. good that "in four
matches only onegoal has been scored
against it. . The positions of the teams
are shown Jn the table:" . '. >

Special Dlepatcb to Tb* CalL
â¢ SANTA BARBARA. Dec 16.â The
fourth semi-annual convention of -the
counties commitees of the California Pro
motion Committee, held here to-day, 'was
one of the most successful In the history
of the organization. The attendance was
large, and the Bubject of discussion,
"Government Aid for California," was
most interestingly discussed. After the
matter was fully talked ..over It was
placed in the hands of committees
tor presentation to the Congress at Wash
ington and the departments for action.
Following â¢ are synopses of the principal
speeches of the day. Following the regu
lar programme the delegates were enter
tained at dinner at the Hotel Potter. To
morrow, they- will ' be taken around the
city to see the show places.
- Joseph J. Perkins, Dresident . of the
Chamber of Commerce of Santa Barbara,
extended a greeting to the delegates.
The convention was called to order by
Andrea Sbarboro, chairman of the Cali
fornia Promotion Committee.
H. R. McNoble. Past Grand President
N. S. G. W., representing San Joaquln
Valley, addressed the delegates, as did
Frank H. Mott. Mayor of Oakland, rep
resenting San Francisco Bay ' counties.
Mayor Mott spoke as follows: .
"Inasmuch as the bay. counties border
on the great harbor of San Francisco
Bay, their chief concern . is for. tbe de
velopment of this harbor in the interest
of commerce,' and . therefore ; the question
carries us to the subject, of Federal'con
trol of the navigable waters of our na
tion.
"Government supervision of trans-bay
traffic should be close and exacting. Trier*
should be established ferry routes in some
manner marked by buoys uflder! Federal
control so .that dangers be reduced to
the lowest minimum. One of Im
portant j projects ' at present affecting j bay
county Interests ' is the proposed /con
struction of. a railroad bridero across the
Straits of Carquinez. To . my mlnd : it Is
essential that the bay and river traffic,
which, is carried on through these straits/
should be given the first conslderatlon.-
The .'United States authorities should ex-,
ercise the* utmost care before ; permission
be given to bridge Carquinez Straits.' Not
only ; should Federal "supervision be given
to the harbor itself, but to all. the navi
gable streams tributary to the Bay of
San' Francisco. I beg to Impress upon \u25a0
you that this committee can do no great
er eeryice to California than to keep ever
before the public ; the splendid opportuni
ties that San' Francisco \u25a0 Bay offers, and
to Impress further the ever 'present neeet
of a wise, honest and "comprehensive sys
tem of' Government' control of Its open
waters."
In his address on the subject of "Op
portunities for,'. Federal aid In California
South of Tehachapi," "William E. Smythe
THE'SAN : FRANGISeo.;CALI:;: ; SUNDAY^DEGE^BER;;I7; : :19O5;
of Ban Diego declared that a comprehen
sive system of forestry is the foremost
need of the region. "Publio buildings can
wait;' harbor ' lmprovements : can' wait; ir
rigation projects can wait. ..But the wa
ter-shed,, which Is. the mother of; streams,
and; hence, the source of all the Institu
tions of our social and economic life,, can
wait no longer." He advocated an ag
gressive policy ; by \u25a0 means \u25a0 of which, the
National Government should compel for
est preservation and extension In spite of
private greed and public Indifference.
"How the Federal- Government ,â¢ Can
Assist the- Development of '\u25a0: the Central
Coast Counties," was the subject of .the
address delivered 'â¢ by 1Â«. W. ; Jefferson,- of

Chester W. Burks, secretary of the
Chamber of Commerce of San â¢ Francisco,
speaking on the topic, "How the * Federal
Government â¢ Can Assist the - Development
of San FrancJsco County" said in part:
"To-day ! the Is - not,\ how can
the Federal Government < assist' the i de
velopment of San * Francisco, ; â¢ but why
does the Federal^ Government fall to fully
appreciate the port : of Ban FranciscoT as
the American base for the Asiatic trade?
If the Federal. Government were to recog
nize the very patent fact that -the Arner^*

from the Atlantio Coast, ' but . must \ start
from San Francisco, - there I would be mo

\u25a0Bacon said that, under the present sys

aries paid to the commission employes.
He j commented on the fact ] that j Shonts'.
salary ; was more than twice as much as
that paid \o '\u25a0. the Chief Justice of the} Su
preme " Court Vof the United :' States, " and
said it was not the policy of ./the Gov
ernment to 7 emulate the high, salaries
paid by private \u25a0 corporations. : Even I the
auditor of , the .commission . â¢; got t \ slo,ooo,
while the man who passed upon, his work
received only $4000, and the executive head
of the department, the Secretary of War,
only $8,000. : \u25a0 '\u25a0-\u25a0\u25a0'\u0084\u25a0 .
.Bacon said In reply to Spooner that he
thought the .". $30,000 paid , the :: chief en
gineer ;of the commission too , great. .
"I would* not pay any of them Â« more
than the Chief Justice is paid,". the Geor
gia Senator, declared.
-Bacon, referring to the payment 'of $10,
000 to the canal commission auditor/ said:
' '.'lt Is - perfectly ! monstrous that this
subordinate officer should ; be paid ' 20 per
cent more , than is paid to the Secretary
of War or, to the Secretary of the' Trea

/He expressed - the opinion that ' not a

paused to hear from any one who might

not aimed at any Individual and that' he
believed I Bishop ito be an . honest, candid

had ; been "Indefensible , : : in ; law,: and I In
famous in i morals." } J He ,- called "attention

SCIENTIST
DESCRIBES
ODD PLANT
BERKELEY, Dec. 16.â A peculiar
plant palled the Corymorpha, which ap-'
pears to r have muscles and nerves as
do animals,/ is described \u25a0at length : by
H. B. Torrey, a scientist connected, with
the department of zoology ?of \u25a0 the \u25a0 State
University.. In a bulletin dealing: with
this â¢ plant-like; : animals. Professor Tor r
rey says: '; '\u25a0 \u25a0: " . ' .: : ;'/ ,-. ./ : .\u25a0 :
I "One'of; the striking features of the
higher i plants is \u25a0 that the stems grow
upward,, the : : roots . downward. 1 As ; the
result of- experiments with. the Cory
morpha, Professor v Torrey finds 'that
not only does- It/bphave in a"' similar,
manner, but the "mechanism by which
the movements -of ' the .stem Â» appear to
be " made is also similar In I both ) cases.
The direction taken by. the stem is due
to a change in . the turgidity/ of the
large vacuolated cells ;wlfich constitute
the major portlon'of ' the stem-tissue.
The cells on the>upper side of a. stem
that in inclined from : the vertical /be-,
come relatively.; smaller , than those ,on
the- lower side, under, the Influence 'of
the force of gravity. There are neither
muscles nor. nerves '-, In plants. There
are both- muscles "and nerves In Cory-*
morpha, but these do not: appear to.be
affected by gravity. The position
which the stem Jof . Corymorpha /as
sumes is rather /due/ to an unconscious
mechanical, reaction, to- an /external
stimulus of /certain tissue-cells,; which
are not Identical with the muscles re
sponsible for other movements of the
body." ;
Professor Torrey has also Just pub
lished a paper ;on differentiation , in
hydroid ; colonies / and ? the problem of
senescence. Ho states as ; tho conclu
sion reached by/ his ' investigations that
old age is a i phenomenon. .of differen
tiation/ depending .> on similar , causes.
The". hydroids are .plant-like animals,
many i growing, like flowers attached to
a\eommon ;Sten>.6Â£.ThOBesat.the/top, of
the- etom differ/ somewhat-'from? those
at .the ;base. This, difference is' ascribed
to a' change ; in the chemical constltu-*
tion of the colony which takes place as
development proceeds, J or. in/other
worcte,. as "- the . colony ages. . Professor
Torrey's'experlinehts; Â«o not .sustain
the \u25a0 theory = that the' structure of. the
adult organism is essentially pre
determined In the' structure :of the

Chief : Conrad said :
'! Tner Â®' are two factions in the local

composed ?of those : who jare , opposed to
Tasaki. The ', minister and ; his followers

the opponents. of .Tasaki say that he is a
fraud,' an Impostor and a grafter. .
."Tasaki came to me same time ago and
wanted certain Japanese run out of town.
I asked him why he: desired them exiled,
and he . replied ', that 'they were bad : men.
I: advised' him that if ; he ; knew.; wherein

complained of should be banished \u25a0 from

to run any person out of town on gnneral

ThÂ« system of' final "exes" at the Stan

>lacfceÂ« ,l)y the "Dally Palo Alto"

tion of a itudent body paper In cen

la considered audacious, as the fata or
the editor of the college "dally" rests
In the hands of this group of profes
sors.*-
" The editor complains not, of tae Idea,
of giving final, examinations, but of the.
practice of continuing: the regular pro
gramme of studies at the same tlmÂ»
and preventing . the student from de
votinar the requisite time to preparation
for the final teats. He .declares that
the practice,, which originated four or
five years ago. is steadily becoming
more stringent from year to year.
The editorial in part. ls as follows:
' ."It has always been generally under
stood that the reason the faculty have
continued classes during the period
when the last examinations of the
semester are given was that the writ
ten reviews that occurred at this time
were not final examinations covering
the whole semester's work. These ex
aminations were stated as covering:
only the work not included in the ex
aminations, given earlier in the semes
ter, and therefore the college work
should continue without interruption.
This was the argument against having
a special examination period during
which classes should be stopped. Con
ditions justified thia argument for a
time, but- during the last two years
there has been a growing tendency to (
give - final examinations, until at pres-J
ent it is no longer uncommon, many 1
students having three or fonr final ex
aminations.. It Is unreasonable to ex
pect a student to take these., final
examinations and at the same time at
tend classes up to the last day.
"If these final , examinations are to
be given, a student must also be given
time to prepare for them. The present
conditions demand the .cessation of
regular work during the examination
period.
"The former condition sof, affairs,
where the students were not given
final examinations and classes were
legitimately kept up to the last day.

a return should be made to thl3 condi

SAYS HUNTED
MEDICO DIED
Authorities Get a Clew in
Case of Dr. Calvin Sharp,
a Fugitive From Justice
PAKLAND, Dec. 16.â The flight of Dr.
Calvin J. Sharp from this city several
years ago upon the bringing of an in
dictzaent against him by the Grand
Jury for causing the death of a young
woman named Anna 'Johnson was
called to the attention of the authori
ties to-day by a communication re
ceived from his brother, Fred G. Sharp,
and steps are to be taken to see if the
statements made are true or if possible
to find but the whereabouts of the for
gotten medico.
The letter reads:
"ROCKWELL, lowa, Dec. 11. 1905.
Clerk .of Courts, Oakland, Cal. â Dear
Sir: Will you please Inform me by re
turn mall if one Agnes Gray Sharp has
got a divorce from her husband, Calvin
J. Sharp, as I am a brother of C. J.
Sharp and have heard that his wife got
a divorce from him, and as my brother
is dead I am appointed administrator.
I must find out these things as soon as
possible. Please keep this inquiry to
yourself and oblige, yours truly,
"FRED G. SHARP.
"P. 8. â I am unable to say anything
about the time the divorce was granted,
if at all. It might have been any time
during the last four or five years. Hop-
Ing you will look this up for me and let
me know as ' soon as possible, I will
thank you in advance, F. G. S."
Sharp was indicted in this city with
John Howard in January, 1897, for per
forming the operation and Howard for
having been the cause of the girl's con
dition and having been implicated in
the employing of a physician. Sharp
fled and has never been heard of, while
Howard, with the girl and doctor gone,
stood trial and* was acquitted.
Shortly after the trial Howard mar
ried Hulda C. Johnson.- the sister of the
girl he was charged with having mur
dered. They left here and went to Tu
lare County, where he was convicted
of being implicated in the coyote scalp
frauds and sentenced to a term In San
Quentin. His wifejreturned to his city
and was granted a divorce from him
in 5903. The records fall to show that
the doctor's wife ever got a divorce
from him.
BOX OP CHINA WARE
STIRS CUSTOM OFFICERS
Secretary ot Treasury and Collector of
Port of Sew York. Asked to
Investigate.
Believing he was overcharged for the
Importation of a box of china dishes,
after which he had looked for a friend,
C. Wheeler Durham of this city has
for two days been warming things up"
for the customs authorities and for
Custom-house brokers. Reams of cor
respondence are already on file and Mr.
Durham has been Invited to step for
ward and become principal prosecutor
in an investigation.
The dishes arrived on May 3 on the
steamer Advance from Colon, and were
consigned to Miss Holmes, of No. 404
West One Hundred and Forty-fifth
street, in which house Mr. Durham
lives. Mr. Durham volunteered to see
the Importation through, evidently not
realizing the endless red tape attached
to government business. He thought
all he would have to do would be to
sign a paper and get the package. He
was wandering about in the red tape
entanglements In the Appraisers' stores
in Washington street, when he met an
amiable young man supposed to be an
official, who took him to the offlce of
Snow's United States Sample Express
Company, 671 Greenwich street, where
he made arrangements for the
company td act as his brokers. The
package was delivered on May 9, but
on learning that the charges were $5.50,
which was fifty cents more than the
valuation of the dishes, Mr. Durham de
clined to accept the package.
Heated correspondence ensued, and
last week the package was taken from
the express company after Miss Holman
had paid an additional seventy-five
cents for storage charges. i
Mr. Durham, first, however, had called
on the Collector of the Port to request
him to direct the express company to
remit the seventy-five cents. He also
had addressed a communication to the
Secretary of the Treasury, in which he
detailed all the circumstances. A copy,
of the complaint was sent to the Col
lector of the Port here, and Mr. Stran
ahan sent in reply the results of a spe- j
clal inquiry which he had made.
"As far as dissatisfaction with the
charges made for the service of brok
ers," said the Collector yesterday, "is
concerned. I can do nothing. I have no
jurisdiction. I have, however, requested
Mr. Durham to accompany a represen
tative of this offlce to the Appraisers'
stores and there to Identify the person
who recommended the express company
to him. It is against the rules for any
government employe to recommend any
broker or carrier. If I find any clerk
or official is guilty I shall discipline
him. We are waiting for Mr. Durham."
It was said in the, offlce of the ex-^
press company that the person who had
assisted Mr. Durham was not an em
ploye of the government, but a clerk of
the company. The china was appraised
at $5 and a duty of sixty per cent was
levied on it. The government fee of
fifty cents was paid, a entry
fee of $1.60 and an express charge of
fifty cents.
It 'was explained that, although the
brokers' fee was seldom, less than $3,
a less amount -is charged when the
value of the shipment is below $100.
The manager of the express company
said lie thought the service had been
performed for^ a" moderate amount con
sidering that the operations for getting
the package out of the stores: and to
the address :, in Harlem were just as
much involved , as ,if the value of the
dishes had been many times that sot
upon them in the, invoice.
The Collector declined' to take -any
action with regard to the broker's fees.

popular, members of the exclusive coterie
of girls at Miss Head's school, and was
chosen by acclamation yesterday when
the selection of a leader to be the Santa
Claus at the evening's entertainment was
being made.
The girl pranced merrily through the
assembly-room while the gayety was at
its height waving a big staff, which sig
nified .her authority. Her head was cov
ered with a snow-white wig, and long,
luxuriant whiskers concealed the feminine
features of the young woman.
A blazing candle set fire* to Miss Walsh's
false beard as she pirouetted through the
room, her swinging form coming for just
a second within the range of the burning
wax taper. Instantly the ; flames shot
through her wig and on down to her flim
sy gown, completely enveloping her. The
schoolgirls shrieked, most of them stand
ing horror-stricken, while the frightened 1
young woman, who seemed likely to be
the victim of her own gay spirits, sped
through the room, herself so bewildered
that she had apparently no thought of
trying to extinguish the flames.
Miss Head grasped a rug and with the
assistance of a maid caught the â¢ flying
girl, smothering the flames. Miss Walsh
was but partly conscious while being re
moved to her room. A physician was
summoned. It was found that her head
and shoulders . were severely burned,
nearly all of her hair '_ having been
scorched by the flames. She may carry
for many years the marks of her thrilling
experience of last night.
Mrs. 8. Evans of British Columbia, an
aunt of Mlsa Walsh, arrived several days
ago to chaperon her niece on a tour of
the world. The aunt will remain to as
sist at the burned girl's bedside. DrJ
George Relnhardt is attending Miss
Walsh. '

thrust a heavy oloth over the babe's face,

of the second story. -Judge Gibson heard
a noise, but after looking through the
lower rooms his suspicions were allayed.
Then the baby's cries in an upper room
caused: the family to' rush upstairs. The
little one was found with a heavy cloth
partly over Its face. The thief, evidently
frightened by the cries, had\ fled after
ransacking only one room, . but he made
away with a gold watch, $2 25 In money
and three diamond rings valued '. at $140
which Mrs. Campbell had left In a bureau
drawer. His muddy footprints were found
on the lace curtain of the window through
which he had entered, and a box beneath
the rear porch showed how he had gained
the balcony.
PLAGUE DEATH ItOM.
OF VAST PROPORTIONS
Great . Britain Accused --of Taking
InadcQuute Measures In
India.
In 1903 the number of deaths from
plague in India was 853,000; In 1904 it
was over 1,000,000, being 1,040,000. Of
the 1,000,000 deaths more than 350,000
occurred in once province, and that
province was the Punjab, the one from
which some of our best Indian' soldiers
are recruited. Consider the possible
significance of a fact like this upon the
efficiency of our Indian army. The
Punjab Is not a largre province, its ac
tual population being about ; 20,000,000,
or. only two-thirds that of England, and
"yet the deaths In the Punjab during
.1904 from plagxie amounted to over
260,000 in the course of twelve weeks
only. *'". ..'\u25a0\u25a0'.'....
We believe that these figures, which
.have been published before, have never
been contradicted, though they seem in
credible. What would be thought, said
or done in England if in the course of
twelve weeks over 250,000 persons were*
swept off by the disease?" Surely
there would be something like*, a panic.
And if this destruction threatened. to be
an:annual, one would, not, any, inactivity
on the part of the authorities Mn whom
prevention Is vested \ be .deeply re
sented? "\u25a0'\u25a0-\u25a0 .: _. i v '-â¢\u25a0\u25a0..\u25a0 \u25a0\u25a0.>/\u25a0," I
The English public has, of course, not
realized the position, and though we
are not playing the alarmist with' any
special- relish for the office, we; think
that the^pollcy- of concealment of the
absence of policy that has necessitated
concealment â has gone on long enough.
The small number of deaths from
plague in; Hongkong and the Mauritius
is regularly published ? every week in
the daily papers, and presumably the
information comes fronVofticial sources,
but the mortality which) occurs in India
from the same disease, and which by its
magnitude is a danger not only to
India, but to the world, is never pub
lishedâit is not considered wholesome
reading.
The public is not aware from official
in formation of the terrible tragedy go
ing on in one part of the Empire â -in
that part 'which is always termed the
brightest jewel in the possession of
the crown, ..for whose welfare we are
nationally/ responsible, and for whose
possession: and maintenance some of
the noblest British blood has been shed.
We have comnwated in the ? Lancet
upon the inquiry undertaken jointly by
the Lister Institute of Preventive Medi
cine, the India office and the Royal So
ciety, the first fruit of which is to be
the dispatch . of two bacteriologists to
the East, and while allowing that the
idea of the inquiry Is a sound one we
have pointed, out that we do not think
the- measures to be undertaken really
meet the case. .Three and" a half mil
lions of people" have died \u25a0 from, the
plague in India since 1898, and the pro
posal to send out: two bacteriologists
to look into; the causes, of the'tragedy
strikes us as inadequate, however, capa
ble and distinguished* the 'gentlemen
connected with the joint inquiry ; may

NEW WORLD'S HIGHWAY
ACROSS MEXICAN ISTHMUS
Transcontinental Route Between Te-
huantepec nml I Coatzacoalcos Be-
lns Built.
United States Consul Moe, at Dublin,
Ireland, reports to the State Department
that considerable interest has been
aroused in the ddevelopmentt t of the trans
continental route between Tehuantepec
and Coatzacoalcos in 'Mexico by British
capital and enterprise.. The British pub
lic considers this .prospective new route
as- an additional outlet for their Pacific
trade, and" are' pleased J to. think; that, it
willbe something of a* rival to the more
southerly canal at Panama. The press
discussions have been numerous, but It is
only recently that j the subject has come
under notice In Ireland.
; "Tne new. world's highway," as the'Te
huantepec route is termed, is a /all way
liX) miles long, and is to" be reconstructed
by a British company under, a partnership
arrangement with the Mexican Govern
ment. It crosses the Isthmus of Tehuan
tepec from Salina Cruz, on the Pacific,
to Coatzacoalcos, on the Atlantic. When
reconstructed It is said there will be no
better railway in the world. There has
been expended already $9,733,000 on the
road itself and $29,199,000 Is being devoted
to the ports, which will be perfectly
equipped. ; The railway company has come
to an"*agreement with a steamship com
pany by which the train service will be
fed by eleven boats, averaging 10,000 tons.
The vessels .will sail, of course, in both
the Atlantic and the Pacific.
"This is going to be one of the greatest
routes of. the world," said Sir Weetman
Pearson, in a ; recent interview, "and it
will divert traffic that now goes round
Cape Horn and by the Suez canal. It will
compete, too, with the American trans
continental railways, for we shall be able
to convey goods from the PacuiC "to the
Atlantic coast of the United States in
twenty days," which "Is less time than .is
occupied by the express freight trains of
some of the railways." The Panama ca
nal will not, he thinks, injure. this big en
terprise. | Tffe railway, with all Its ap
purtenances, is 1200 miles north of Pana
ma and SOO miles south of New Orleans.
"Here, then," he says, "Is the natural
highway to -the Atlantic."

MAILABLE SOUVENIR
POSTAL CARDS
Popular Misapprehension That Makea
Many of Them Unavall
\u25a0blgJMHâMi
A law was enacted by. Congress a few
years ago, which provided that cards of
the same size and weight as the ordinary
postal cards might be sent through the
malls as ordinary, postal cards provided a
1-cen t stamp was affixed.
Many of the printed cards sold as sou
venir postal cards meet these require
ments and can be written upon and sent
through the mails with a 1-cent stamp
affixed. The . trouble , Is, however, that
not "all, or Indeed most, of the souvenir
postal cards do meet the Government're
quirement. Many of them are much big
ger than the ordinary cards and they are
made of -leather and wood and almost
everything 'else. \
: All of these cards are mailable as mer
chandise at ; the rate of 1 : cent ' an ounce,
buti-lf 'anything is ; ; written upon them
they require . letter postage, which is 2
cents an ounce. V The leather cards, which
are so popular this season, are of about
the same sizeas -the 'ordinary cards and
.would be mailable 'if not -written upon if
it were not for I the fact that they ; are
much thicker than the ordinary postal
cards. This bars them from the mails ex
cept as merchandise, and if written upon
letter postage must be paid.
The wooden souvenirs are : generally
much larger and heavlv than ordinary
postal cards and : geneiÂ«ny -; w<l?h . more
than an ounce. Upon these* if there is
any writing, 4 cents in stamps must be
affixed.; 1 ' ..," '-\u25a0' **:; ; '^"^ : ". \u25a0-. . -

DEVLIN READY
TO PROSECUTE
Will Not Allow Former Posi
tion as lawyer for South
ern Pacific to Be Hindrance
AWAITS INSTRUCTIONS
District Attorney Declares
He Will Do His Duty in
Any Case Against Roads
Special Dispatch to T&a CaU.
FOLSOM, Dec. 16.â "1 will not hesitate
a moment In prosecuting any railroad in
my district which has been guilty of giv
ing rebates contrary to law," said United
States District Attorney Robert Devlin
when discussing the recent order Issued
by the Attorney General and addressed to
all United States District Attorneys. "I
have not yet received my letter of In
struction and do not expect It until the
middle of this week. Until It reaches me
I cannot tell Just what I will do. The
Grand Jury, however, begins Its work on
Monday, and we will be glad to get any
evidence which will show that a rebate
has been given by any railroads of our
district. If I can get hold of such Infor
mation I will begin immediate prosecu
tions." . .
It may be that in the letter of Instruc
tions from the Attorney General evidence
of a sensational nature against the rail
roads operating In California may be in
closed. Last June James A. Garfield of
the Department of Commerce and Labor
called upon District Attorney Devlin and
told him that If during the following six
months certain men called on him
he was to give them every assistance
that he could. Garfield told Devlin that
these men would be in the employ of. the
Government, hired for the purpose of
gathering evidence. Devlin promised to
give all the assistance In hi 3 power.
Months passed and the men did not call
at the offlce of District Attorney Devlin.
He Is in a quandary. He does not know
whether they have been working along
secret lines, and did not communicate
with him for this reason, or whether they
decided not to make an investigation.
"I do not know what this letter from
the Attorney General will contain." h<*
said last night. "Strong evidence against
the railroads may be inclosed. I cannot
tell. On Monday I will know Just what
has been done and what steps I will
take."
One difficulty which falls to District At
itorney Devlin in the prosecution of. the
railroads Is the fact that the head men
of the Southern Pacific and Santa Fe do
not live in his district, but In Eastern
cities. It may be that he -will be sent out
to gather â¢ evidence to furnish to certain
District Attorneys m the East.
"I have received no information," Dis
trict Attorney Devlin said, "of rebates
having been given by any railroads In
this district. I have no reason to believe
that any have been given, for this reason,
and so I believe that none have been
given. Rebates are. of course, a hard
matter to Investigate and some may ex
ist without my knowledge. Once Infor
mation of rebates comes to my offlce.
however, we will not rest until we have
seen the prosecutions through."
Devlin was questioned about the rebates
alleged to have been given to the fruit
company in which Lieutenant Governor
Anderson Is a heavy stockholder. Devlin
said that he knew nothing of the affair
more than that he had heard that re
bates had been given by the refrigerator
company which owns the cars in which
the fruit 13 shipped.
"I cannot tell until I get my Instruc
tions from Washington." said Devlin,
"whether or not refrigerator car com
panies can give rebates and yet be with
in the law. I do not- know whether this
law that applies to the railroad compa
nies holds when brought against a refrig
erator company. If I find that It does I
will Investigate any evidence that-can be
obtained against . Lieutenant Governor
Anderson's or any other company which
received rebates from a refrigerator car
company."
Devlin declared In positive words that
his long connection with the Southern
Pacific Company as Its attorney would
have.no Influence on him should evidence
against the railroad be brought to him.
"I am not working for the Southern Pa
cific. I am the United States District At
torney," he said, "and aÂ» such I will
prosecute any Infringement of the law
by any company. I think that the peo
ple know-. this by this time. If evidence
comes to me or I can discover any wrong
doing I will not hesitate a moment about
commencing prosecution."

fies: "LAST WEEK my friend was suffer-
ing from ERYSIPELAS in its most danger-
ous etage. Face of fiery red, and "enor-
mously" swollen, closing one eye entirely, the
other nearly. 6o greatly did the bloat disfig-
ure and distort her features that her family
J could NOT RECOGNIZE her. By ONE
"*\u25a0\u25a0 treatment Rexradio removed nearly all the
swelling, the skin became of natural color,
the eyes opened freely and the face was
plainly RECOGNIZABLE.â A leading man
in our CITY GOVERNMENT for years had
one ear so DEAF that it was practically
USELESS. It was <;ulc_Jy helped; I wit-
nftst-d it hearing WHISPERED sentences at

NESSES were W. Robinson. 1101 Golden

arm* contracted badly, cculd only move the
HEAD a little. After ONE treatment she
RAIPED arms straight above head, the fixed
WRIST was freed and BENT and moved
V.aturaUy, a* also did the knee caps; FEEL-
ISG entirely .restored to the hand, CON-
" TRACTED muscles were all LOOSENED,
the HEAD turned round the natural dls-

rooms, a library and writing-room, which
looks- out upon the garden, and extensive
drawing-rooms, which may be thrown to
gether upon occasion. A permanent stage
Is erected in one of these, where con
â¢certs, lectures and dramatic performances

ATTEXDAVTS SPEAK ENGLISH.
, The large retinue of servants which has
been, retained la German. To the satis
faction of the English and American
members, however, the porter and head
waiter speak English fluently. Entering
Into the clubhouse the visitor receives the
impression that *he Is In a small exclu
sive hotel. Indeed, the German women
speak of it as a hotel.
Women's clubs in Germany have here
tofore been widely different organizations
from those of American and English
women.- ThÂ«Â» fiwt-wM founded t?n years
ago under great difficulties. A second
club, formed especially to meet the re
quirements of the working woman^ has a
metnber*h!p of over 1200 and has, done
some splendid work. But, in the organ
lzation of these -the founders met wfth no
Interest or sympathy, least of all co-op
eration, from the men. In thÂ« Lyceum
project, however, men like Dr. Jessen of
the Royal Museum of Industrial Art, Dr.
Lteberrnann of the National Gallery. Dr.
Joachim and almost all the modern writ
ers and dramatists have assisted In every
possible way.
The German women are not accustomed
to club life; club habits are not developed
as they are in England and America, and
it I* probable that the growth of the Ly
ceum will be much slower than it would
150 In any other country.' But ranch Is
"hoped from the development, of interna
tional spirit, the possibilities offered to the
different circles of society as well as to
the represÂ«ntatlveÂ» of the different coun
tries meeting on a common ground of In
tellectual endeavor and interest The Ger
man Lyceum now numbers 600 members,
cf which. about 200 are Americans.-
To the American woman residing In Ber
lin the opening of the Lyceum was really
a matter of great interest. Here was a
clubhouse such as. she had been accus
tomed to. where she could enjoy the
privileges of beautiful rooms, and give
her lunches, teas or dinners at little ex
p**nsc. Despite the fact that it Is a
German club, the atmosphere Is like home
.to the cutivated woman. '. ; \u25a0
It !s most Interesting, too. from a social
sfandpoint. Here the American meets the
German women whose names have be
\u25a0c-ome familiar to her through her works

society, -or in connection with great social

Carmen Sylva, the gifted and intellect

Df the club in Germany, and on the day
of the opening a letter was receiyed from
her in which she expressed her regret
Tl'at her position forbade her following
her wishes and coining to Berlin to reside
in the club and take up active duties as
president.

TELLS OF HIS LOSSES
Says Those Most Interested
in His Affairs Know of
His' Financial Standing
Si'Pdal Dispatch to The Call.
BOSTON. Mass., Dec. 16.â While admit
ting that he has Just -^'clinched a mort
gage" for $850,003 on his real estate, in ad
dition to former mortgrage for $265,000,
Thomas W. Lawson to-day denied that
he Is "broke." He did confess that for j
several months he had been headed in
that direction at a rapid pace and that
unless the market changes he will
reach the goal.
"There's no use in denying it," he said,
when the question was asked, him. "Those
most interested to know already iknow it.
They know that I have been on the wrong
end of the market. It jars my sense .-of
perspicacity to have to. admit that I have
been there so long, but a fellow must find
a philosophy for that feeling when he
goes into the stock market.
"I've played my hand right out in tha'
open. I # say I^had information that a
certain condition existed and that a con
sequence has not.yet arrived, but it is as
'sure as Christmas to come, or I'm broke,
"Oh, I've heard all that before." he in
terrupted at the suggestion that many
thought his actions' were exactly in the
opposite direction from his words as set
forth in interviews, and that he was
"long" of the system's pet stocks Instead
of short of them. v
"That's the sort of a yarn that any
little fellow on the curb can start, but
the real fellows - sitting at this ' game
would write me down as an ass if I
attempted to give them such a bluff.
"They know in New York and to a
certain extent they have got ': It right. I
did set forth in my advertisement that
the $10.000,000 -which I was handling, had
suffered a loss of '$3,600,000. That was the
fact, although if you subtract the 8 per
cent dividend that I previously paid to
members of that pool the* loss Is 28 per
cent instead of 36 per cent.' You may say,
if you care to do so, however, that this
pool was made up only of Lawson and a
few assistants. I and my dose associates
subscribed six-tenths of the first pool.
The balance was made up by rich men
throughout the country who believed in
me and who could afford to lose if they
had to. The best evidence of this belief
Is the fact that when I gave notice of
a loss of $3,500,000 some of them took
their proportion, of : the additional sub
scription of $5,000,000.'* â¢
Lawson ref sed to give the names of
the wealthy men associated with him,
but Intimated that they are large New

pretty certain to lose his life. In
times gone by, however. It might eas
ily have gone even harder, with him.
For instance." so lately as In 1850 an
Austrian pamphleter named Telki was
shot at Grata for writing and publish
ing a book reflecting on the good faith
of Count Buol, the Foreign Minister.
The work was published at 9 o'clock
in the morning: at 10 it was ordered
to be suppressed; half an nonr- later
the unhappy author was being tried
by drumhead court-martial, and before
noon he had been pronounced guilty
and executed. : -yi

HAS GOOD EYES
FOR BAD MONEY
Treasury Submits All Doubt

EXPERIENCE OF4OYEAES
Now Considered Most Expert
Detector of Counterfeits
in the Treasury Service
"You can't tell a counterfeit \u25a0bill by the
'feel,',," said Mra/Wllla A. Leonard, ex
pert money-counter and the authority on
counterfeits in the redemption- division of
the United States Treasury!Department.
â¢â¢E^'ery counterfeit hasTsome Imperfec
tion^ however slight it may ! be. : This is
an acknowledged "factJt^Ntv' matter,-; how
skillful the engraver^of Tthe ; counterfeit,
no matter what process, has been used in
order to defraud the, Government, 'there is
always in the counterfeit some departure
from the genuinenote, which, as soon as
it comes to our hands,' strikes ,us as. a
blunder, but which passes without ques
tion the eyes of some ; of the most ex
perienced business men of the country. ;
"We have heard much of the detection
by-touch theory, but there Is little truth
in it. Of -course, bad money has come
into the office ; which -was detected Â«3
counterfeit as soon as we touched It, but
the 'feel* of the note 1b by no means de
cisive, lor many of the counterfeits we
have received have been made of genuine
paper,' madÂ« at the Bureau of Engraving
and Pointing,- which has been obtained by
bleaching notes of small denomination. :
KKLIE S O3V THE \ EYE.
"The only thing; to be relied upon is the
eye. The coloring of the note, Its" size;
and the work of the engraver are the
points which usually give away the coun
terfeit. The . ink / may be a fairly good'
imitation ]of that used on the genuine
note, but the note may be found to be a
thirty-second of an inch shorter or long
er, wider or narrower, than It should be.
Or it may be perfect almost in both of
these two respects and the fault lie in the
engTavlng. No. one has ever seen a per-;
fectly engraved counterfeit : note. 1 . There
have, however, ; been some very skillful
engravers among the counterfeiters; who,
if they had followed : their, trade leglti
mately t would have made fortunes.
"The 'ssoo note, series of 1869. was prob
ably the best. This note was made of
genuine paper, which must have been ob
tained through bleaching a note of small
er denomination, and was -made "by one
of the best engravers in the world. ; This
note had only two 'small defectsâ the fig
ure of a goddess ornamenting its face
had a badly drawn foot, and in a vig
nette of a man the genuine note showed
perfectly round buttons on his coat, but
In the counterfeit the buttons had slight
corners on them. \u25a0
"The JlOOO note, series of 1863," which
was the first - issue of greenbacks; was
also a notable counterfeit, -in fact, one
was accepted at . the treasury. â¢ The notes
of j that issue were usually - passed in
Texas . between cattle dealers. It took \u25a0 a
long time ' for them to . reach our j office,
for. they '-had -'first to - eo> to the, sub
treasury at Chicago. \ V . .'. ;'.':'; ' '.
"The- only j bad ' point of tnis* note' wad
in the spacing of the letters in ' America.
.The , genuine . note . had . a space ..between
two of , the letters j and the counterfeit
had -no epace.' It ' Would nof ; be : so , easy
to pass such a note to-day, \u25a0: however,
as we use ' tue . fiber paper. \u25a0 ,j -â¢
. \u25a0"l'ou have : probably heard,"' continued
Mrs. Leonard, "of the JlOOand 550 coun
terfeits . in' pen and^ ink. These .were
made by- a German lln New Jersey and
the pen work: of them was ' marvelous.
The fellow worked secretly, in a room
which was closed to every one, even his
wife and family. ,;He> became reckless
with his money, was .suspected and
caught by - the secret \u25a0 service metu This
happened in 1893." .
"Is it true that genuine plates have
ever been stolen from the bureau of en- ',
graving and printing and counterfeits
made therefrom?" ; \u25a0/."\u25a0-.- ';
"No; all stories to, that : effect are
myths. Those, plates have . always . beÂ«n
guarded the same . as. an Emperor's jew
els. It is not possible to make away with
a genuine plate." '
CONTROVERSY OF EXPERTS.
t "Have wrong, decisions ever been made
upon a doubtful, note?" f; ''â¢ ' ; . ;
"Well, S only one 1 case has ; come to | my
immediate notice. In IÂ®4 aHO note was
brought to me to Â» be ; stamped 'good.' I
pronounced' It to be counterfeit, .but .the
Bender not agreeing with my opinion, the
note was taken through E the redemption
division, the cash : room and ';: the : secret
service division, where, with \ few -excep
tions. It was declared : genuine by. the
experts.- It was then sent to .the ' bureau
of . engraving j and J printing returned
from" there with a, typewritten certificate
of its '. genuineness. These decisions 'did
not influence me, . however, >' and I main
tained 'my posltloi ~i bo .: firmly that my
chief took it once more, on: a round of
inspection and finally found in t the cash
room its exact duplicate 1 among the coun
terfeits there. ; \ ,
"When:the note In question was ; again
brought to -the notice of < the^ man ;/ in
charge of l tne bureau,',; he â¢ offered tto buy
it, and thus back the opinion J given.' The
chief of the redemption, , of course,' refused
to Bell it and requested \u25a0 that ; an engraver
examine the counterfeit f with' aid ; of Â«'a
magnifying . glass.':-: When tthia .-was done
the ; experts discovered â¢ at : Jast > tnat ', they_
