though it -would burst. I flew back
again through the black corridor,
through the wings and out to Ober

ripped open the neck of my dress, and,
pulling the chain with that great-dia

tug, and threw the whole thing down
on the desk in front of him.
"Tor GQd'a_jsake!" I yelled. "Don't

BISHOP'S
CARRIAGE
f-MHIS la tbo second Installment of Miriam Mlchel-
I son's noted novel, "In the Bishop's Carriage," the
I first Installment of which appeared in The. Sunday
- X .Call Magazine { on ifuly 10. This novel Is almost
twice as much in demand at the leading; libraries as
any other one \ piece of fiction, and is one of the -two best
selling books of the day. Miss Michelson, before enter-
Ing Eastern fields, was one of the best known newspaper
women of this State, and it may be . of interest to those
who arc following the "Bishop's Carriage" to know that
Miss Michebon's first Journalistic experience was gained
on The Call. The story of the career of a professional
female thief, treated in a highly literary style, la an orig
inal I motif for a first-class ' work \ of fiction, and in the
portrayal of the character of Nance Olden. Miss Michel
son has created a girl thoroughly Iminan, with fanlts
rather acquired than native, and with a bump of piquant
humor* so generously. developed as to enlist for her, even
in her delinquencies, tho keen j interest "and tne sympa
thies of the readeab Tba *tarj vrW ho ctmaptetcd In two
more Installment* vthat's stolen. So I let her think I'd
stolen it in the railway station and
we came to terms.
With what she gave me I bought a
wig. Mag,' I want you some day, when
you can get [off, to come and see that
wig. I shouldn't wonder but you'd
recognize it. It's red, of very coarse
hair, but a wonderful color, and so
long It â yes, it might be your own,
Mag Monahan, it's so much like it. -I
went to the theater and got my Chari
ty rig, took It home and sat for hours
there just looking at "em both. When
evening came I was ready to "earn it
now." . f.rmi-..
You see, Obermuller had ..given -me
the whole day to be away, and neither
Gray nor the other three Charities ex
pected me back. I had to do It on
the sly, you sassy Mag! Yes, it was
partly because" I love to cheat, but
more because I was bound to have
my, chance' once whether anybody else
enjoyed it or not.
, I came to the theater In my Charity
rig and the wig. It looked as if I'd
slept in it. and it came down to the
draggled hem of the skirt All the
way there I walked like you, Mag.
Once, when a newsboy grinned at me
and shouted "Carrots!" I grinned back
âyour own, old Cruelty grin, Mag. I
vow I felt so ; much like youâ as you
used to beâ that when I lurched 'out. on
the stage at } last, stumbling over my
shoe laces and trying to push the hair
out of my eyes, you'd have sworn it
was little Mag Monahan making her
debut in the Cruelty Board room.
Oh. Mag, Mag, you darling Mag! Did
make old Tom Dorgan'grin.
-All the' way back I had him In my
mind. He's a tigerâ Tomâ when he's
roused/ I could see' him,. shut up there
by himself with not a sou!^to talk to,
with not a human eye to look'totev' 5 jrtth
not a thing on earth to do â Tom, v/ho's
action itself! He never waa tnvW of a
thinker, and I never saw him read even
a newspaper. What would he do to kill
the time? Can't you see him there, at
bay, back on his haunches, cursing and
cursed, alone In the everlasting black
silence? :
â¢ I saw nothing else. Wherever I
turned my eyes that terrible picture
was before . me. . And always It was
Just on the verge of becoming some
thing elseâ something worse. He could
throttle the world with 1 his bare hands
if it had but one neck in the, mood he
must be in now.
It was when I couldn't bear it a mo
ment longer that I set my mind to
find something else to think of.
I found it, Mag. Do you know what
it was? It was Just three wordsâ of
Obermuller's: "Earn it now."
After all. Miss Monahan, this graft
honesty they all preach so much about
hasn't anything mysterious In it All
it is, Is putting your wits to work
according to the rules of the game and
-not against them. I was driven toÂ»itâ
the. thought. of big Tom crouching -for
a ? spring -in '.the 'dark cell up yonder
sent me whirling out into the thinking
place, like the picture or the soul In
the big book at Latimer's I read out
of. And first thing you know, 'pon
honor, Mag, it was as much fun plan-
don said the diamonds were found in
the bellboy's jacket the thief had left
behind him."
"Well! It only shows what a bad
habit lying Is. Nora must have fibbed
to me for the pure pleasure of fibbing.
I'll never dare to trust her again. Do
you believe then that she didn't have
anything to do with the hotel robbery?
I do hope so. It's one less sin on her
wicked head. It's hard having such a
girl in the family!" Oh, wasn't I
grieved! ; â¢â¢
He looked me straight in the 'eye.
I looked at him. I was unutterably
sad about that tough sister of mine,
and I vow I looked holy then, though
I never did before and may never
again.
"Well, I only saw her In the twi
light," he said slowly, watching my
face all the time. "You two sisters are
miraculously alike."
The train was slowing down and I
got up with my basket I stood right
before him, my full face turned toward
him. ' ';. V
"Are we?" I asked simply. "Don't
you think it's more the expression than
anything else, and the voice? ! Nora's
really much fairer than I am. Good
by."
He watched me as I went out I felt
his eyes on the back of my jacket,
and I was tempted to turn at the' door
and make a face at him. But I knew
something better and safer than that.
I waited till the train was just pulling
out, and then, standing below his win
dow, I motioned to him to raize it
He did.
The gall of you! But It only proves that
[ Fred Obermuller never yet bought a
gold -brick. Only, let me In on your
racket .next time. There, go. onâ take
It ...It's yours." ,
'Oh, to have Fred Obermuller say
things like that to you!
. He gave me a bit of a push. 'Twas
Just a lovepat I stumbled out on to the
stage.

And that's why, Marguerite de Mon
ahan, I want you to buy in the
madam here. Let 'em keep on calling
it Troyon's as much as they want, but
you're to be a partner on the money
I'll give you. If this fairy story lasts.
It'll be your own, Mag â a sort of com
mission you get on my take-off of you.
But If anything happens to the world
âif it should go crazy, or get sane, and
not love Nancy Olden any more, why,
here'll be a place for me, too.
Does It look that way? Dlvll a bit,
you croaker! It looksâ it looksâ listen
and I'll tell you how It looks.
It looks as though Gray and the
great Gray rose diamond and the three
Charities had all become a bit of back
ground for Nance Olden to play upon.
It looks as though the audience likes
the sound of my voice as much almost
as I do myself; anyway, as much as it
does the sisht of me.
. It looks as though the press, If you
please, had discovered a new stage
'star, for down comes a little reporter
to Interview me â me, Nance Olden!
Think of It, Magi I receive him all in
my Charity rig, and In Obermuller's
office, and he asks me silly questions
and I tell him a lot of nonsense, but
some truths, too, about the Cruelty.
Fancy, he didn't know what the Cru
elty was! S. P. C. C he calls it And
all the time we talked a long-haired
German artist he had brought with him
was sketching Nance Olden In different
poses. Isn't that the limit?
What d'ye think Tom Dorgan'd say
to see half a page of Nancy Olden In
the X-RayT Wouldn't his eyes pop?
Poor old Toml â¢ â¢ â¢ No dangerâ
they won't let him have the papers.
â¢ â¢ â¢ My old Tommy I
What Is it, Mag? Oh. what was I
saying? Yes â yes, how it looks.
Well, It looks as though the Trust
yes, the big and mighty T. T.â short
for Theatrical Trust you innocent
had heard of that same Nance Olden
you read about In the papers. For one
night last week, when I'd just come
off and the house was yelling and
shouting behind me, Obermuller meets
me In the wings and trots me off to
his private office.
"What for?" I asked him on the
way.
"You'll find out In a minute. Come
on."
I pulled up my stocking and followed.
You kaow I wear it in that act without
a garter, and it's always coming down
the way yours used to, Mag. Even
when it doesn't come down I pull it up,
I'm so in the habit of doing it.
A little bit of a man, bald-headed,
with a dyspeptic little black mustache
turned down at the corners, watched
me come In. He grinned at my make
up, and then at me.
"Clever little girl." he says through
his nose. "How much do you stick
Obermuller for?"
"Clever little man." say I, bold as
brass and through my own nose; "none
of your business."
"Hi â you. Olden!" roared Obermuller,
-as though I'd run. away and ha was
trying to get the bit from between my
teeth. "Answer the gentleman prettily.
Don't you know a representative of the
mighty T. T. when you see him? Can't
you see the Syndicate aureole about his
noble brow? This gentleman, Nance,
is the great and only Max Tausig. He
humbleth the exalted and uplifteth the
lowlyâ or, if there's more money in it.
he gives to him that hath and steals
from him that hasn't but would mighty
well like to have. He has no con
science, no bowels, no heart. But he
has got' tin and nerve and power to
beat the band. In short,' and for all
practical purposes for one in your pro
fession, Nancy Olden, he's Just God.
Down on your knees and lick his boots
â Trust gods wear boots, patent leath
ersâand thank him for permitting It,
you lucky baggage!"
I looked at the little man; the angry
red was just fading from the top of
his cocoanut-shaped bald head.
"You always were a fool, Obermul
ler," he said cordially. "And you were
always over-fond of your low-comedian
Jokes. If you hadn't been so smart with
your tongue you'd had more friends
and not so many enemies In â "
"In the heavenly Syndicate, eh? Well.
I have lived withoutâ"
"You have lived, butâ"
"But where do I expect to go when
I die? Good theatrical managers,
Nance, .when they die as individuals go
to heavenâ they get into the Â¦ Trust.
After that they just touch buttons; the
Trust does the rest Bad onesâ the
kickersâ the Fred Obermullers go toâ
.a_ place where salaries cease from
troubling and royalties are at rest. It's
a slow place where â where. In short,
there's nothing doing. And only ona
thing's doneâ the kicker. It's that
place Mr. Tausig thinks I'm bound for.
And it's that place he's come to rescue
you from, from sheer goodness of heart
and a wary eye for all there's in it.
Cinch him, Olden, - for all the traffic
will bear!"
I looked from one to the otherâOber
muller, big and savage underneath all
his gay talk, I knew him well enough
to "see that; the little man, his mouth
turned down at the corners and a sneer
in his eye for the fellow 'that wasn't
clever enough to get in with the push:
"You must not give the young woman
the big head, Obermuller. Her own is
big' enough, I'll bet, as It is. I ain't
prepared to make any startling offer
to a Httle girl that's Just barely got her
nose above the wall. The slightest
shake might knock her off altogether,
or she mightn't' have strength enough
in herself to hold on. But we'll give
her a chance. And because of what it
may lead to, if she works hard, because
of the opportunites we can give her,
there ain't so much In It in a money
way as you might imagine."
Obermuller didn't say anything. His
ovn lips and his own eyes sneered now,
and he winked openly at me, which
made the little man hot" v(i
"Blast it!" he twanged. "I mean it

coming down to your dirty little joint
that we've set our hearts on having
the girl just get busy thinking some
thing else. /She may be worth some
thing to youâ measured up against the
dubs. you've got, but to us â "
"To you. it's not so much your not
having' her as my having her thatâ"
"Exactly. It ain't our policy to leave
any doubtful cards in the enemy's
hands. He can have the bad ones. He
couldn't get the good ones. And the
doubtful ones, like this girl Olden â "
"I want to see Tom," I begged. "It's,
so long since he â He's up at â at â In â¢
the country."
"Sing Sing?"* s , .
I nodded. ,.
"You poor little devil!" ..'v r >?'^^ v
That finished me. I'm not used to
being pitied. I sobbed and sobbed -as
though some dam had broken inside"
of me. You see, Mag, I knew in that
minute that I'd been afeald, deathly
afraid of Fred Obermuller's face, when
it's scornful and sarcastic, and of his
voice, when it cuts the flesh of self
conceit off your very bones. And the
contrast â well. It was too much for me.
But something came quick to sober
me.
It was Gray. She stormed in, fol
lowed by Lord Harold and Topham,
and half the company.
"The diamond, the rose diamond!"
she shrieked. "It's gone! And the car
per.ten? say that new girl Olden came
flying from the direction of my dress
ing-room. I'll hold you responsible â "
"Hush-sh!" Obermuller lifted his
hands and nodded over toward me.
"Olden!" she squealed. "Grab her,
Tcpham. I'll bet she stole that dia
mond, and she can't have got rid of it
yet."
Topham Jumped toward me, but
Obermuller stopped him.
"You'd win only half your bet, my
I^ady," Obermuller said softly. "She
did get hold of the Gray rose, worth
fifty thousand dollars, in spite of all
your precautions â "
The world seemed to fall away from
me. I looked up at him. I couldn't be
lieved he'd go back on me.
"And she brought it straight to me,
cs I had asked her to, and promised to
raise her salary if she'd win out. For
I knew that unless I proved to you
it could be stolen, you'd never agree
to hire a. detective to watch those
things, which will pet us all into
trouble some. -Here! Scoot out o* this.
It's nearly time for your number."
He passed the diamond over to her,
and they all left the office.
So did I; but he held out his hand
as I passed. "It goes â that about a
raise for you. Olden. Now earn it."
Isn't he white, Mag â white clean
through, that bis fellow Obermuller?
VI.
I got into the train. Mag, the happiest
girl in all the country. I'd a bis basket
of things for Tom. I was got up In my
Sunday best, for 1 wanted to make a
hit with 6ome fellow with a key up
there, who'd make things soft and easy
for my Tommy.
I had so much to tell him. I knew
just how I'd take off every member of
the company to amuse him. I had
memorized every joke I'd heard since
I'd got behind the curtainâ not very
hard for me; things always had a way
of sticking in ; my mind. I knew the
newest scngs in town, and the choruses
6f all the old ones. I could show him
the latest tricks with cards'â I'd got
those at first hand from Professor
Haughwout. You know how great Tom
is on tricks. I could explain the dis
appearing woman mystery and the
mirror cabinet I knew the clog dance
that Dewiit and Daniels do. I had pic
turps of the trained seals, the great
elephant act. Mademoiselle Picotte do
ing hi r great tight-rope dance, and the
Brothers . Borodini in their pyramid
tumbling.
Yes, it was a whole vaudeville show,
with refreshments between the acts
that I was taking up to Tom Dorgan.
I don't care much for a lot of that
truckâ funny, isn't It, how you get to
turn up your nose at the things you'd
have given a ringer for once upon a
tine? But Tomâ oh. I'd got everything
pat Tcr himâ my big. handsome Tom
Dorc-fin in stripesâ with his curls all
Ehaved off â ugh!
I'd got Just so far in my thoughts,
sitting there in the train, when I gave
a rhiver. I thought for a minute it
was r.i the idea of my Tcm with one of
those bare, round convict-heads on him,
that look like fat skeleton faces. But
it wasn't. It wasâ
Guecs, Mag.
Both of us thought the same thing
cf each other for the first second that
our eyes met. I could see that. He
thought I was caught at last. And I
ihoupht he'd been sharp once too often.
And, Mag, it would be hard to say
which of us would have Deen happier
if it had been the truth.
Oh. to meet Mori way, bound sure
enough for Sing Sing!
He got tip and came over to me,
smiling wickedly. He took the seat
behind m*, and leaning forward, said
softly:
"Is Miss Oincjr engaged to read to
eome invalid ujÂ» at Sing Sing? And for
hew Ions a termâ I should say, en
gagement?"
I' got through shivering by then. I
was ready for him. I -turned and looked
at him in that very polite, distant sort
o" way Gray u>*s in her act when the
Charity superintendent speaks to her.
It's the only decent thing she does;
chances are that that's how Lord*
Gray's mother looks at her.
"You know my sister, Mr.â Mr.â " I
csked humbly.
He looked at me, perplexed for just
a second.
"Sister bj^ingred:" he said at last
"I know you, Nat, and I'm glad to my
finger-tips that you've got it in the
neck, in spite of all your smartness."
"You're altogether wrong, sir," I said
very stately, but hurt a Lit. you know.
â¢I've often been taken for my sister,
but gentlemen usually apologize when
I explain to them. It's hard enough to
have a sister whoâ" I looked up at him
tearfully,, with my chin a-wabble with

"Liars should have good memories."
he sneered. "Miss Omar said she was
an orphan, you remember, and had not
a relative in the world."
"Did the say that? Did Nora say
that?" T exclaimed piteously. "Oh,
â¢what a little liar she Is! I suppose she
thought it made her more interesting
to be bo alone, more appealing to kind
hearted Gentlemen like yourself. I hope
Kite wasn't ungrateful u> you, too, as
she was to that kind Mr. Latlmer, be
fore he found her out. And she* had
tuch a good position there, too!"
I wanted to lock at him, oh, I wanted
to! But it was my role to sit there
with downcast eyes, just the picture of
holy grief. I was the good oneâ the
good, shocked sister, and though I
wasn't a bit afraid of anything he
could do to me, or any game he could
put up, I yearned to make him believe
me â Just because he was so suspicious,
no Â¦wickedly smart, so sure he was on.
i3ut his very silence sort of told me
he almost believed, or that he was lay
ing a trap.
"Will you tell me," he said, "how
youâ your sister got Latlmer to He for
her?"
"Mr. Latimerâ He! Oh, you don't
know him. He expected a lady to read

big theater full of a peevish vaudeville

at all to give, and then settle down to
giggle at every move you made?
Girl / alive, I Just had ''em! They
couldn't take their eyes off me. If I
squirmed, they howled. If I stood on
one foot, scratching the torn leg of my
stocking with the otherâ you know,
Magâ they yelled. If I grinned, they
Just roared.
Oh, Mag, can't you see? Don't you
understand? I was Jt The center of
the stage I carried round with meâ it
was Just Nancy Olden. And for ten
minutes Nancy had nothing to do. but
to play with 'em. Ton my life. Mag.
It's Just like stealing; the old graft ex
actly; ; It's so fascinating, so busy, and
risky, except that they play the game
with you and pay you and love you to
fool 'em. Â¦ 'C^ '4\.?

""Ah I then her name isat Omar.
What- might it be?"
"I'd rather not tellâ If you don't

"But when Latlmer found out she

"She confessed to him. Nora's not
really so bad a girl asâ" â¢
."Very interesting! But It doesn't
happen to be Latimer's version. And
you say Latlmer wouldn't lie."
I got pale â but the paleness was on
the inside of me. Think I waa going to
flinch before a chump like Mori way,
even if I had walked straight Into his
trap? ';.O^
"It isn't?" I exclaimed.

Â¦I can see his face yet, Mag, and every
time I think of tt, It makes me nearly

And whether it was or not, Mag, It
was ' all I got. after Â¦ all. " Forâ would

"Well, that's Just where you*!* mis
taken!" Obermuller thrust his hands
deep in his pockets and put. out that
square chin of his like the fighter he la.
'"This girl Olden' is anything but
doubtful. She's a big: c ard rl S nt now
if she could be well handled. And the
time Isn't so far off when, if you get
her, you people will be â "
"Just how much is your interest in
her worth?" the little man sneered.
Obermuller glared at him and in the
pause I murmured demurely:
"Only a six-year contract."
Mag 1 , you should have seen 'em Jump
âboth of 'em; the little man with vex
ation, the big one with surprise.
A contract! Me 7â Nance Olden! Why.
Mag, you Innocent, of course I hadn't.
Managers don't give six-year contracts
to girl-burglars who've never set foot
on the. stage.
When the little man was gone, Ober
muller cornered me.
"What's your game. Olden?" he cried.
"You're too deep for me; I throw up
my hands. Come, what've you got in
that smart little head of yours? Are
you holding out for higher stakes?
Do you expect him to buy that great
slx-yeer contract and divvy the, pro
ceeds with me? Because he willâ when
once they get their eye on you. they'll
have you; and to turn up your nose
at their offer is Just the way to make
them itch for you. But how the deuce
.did you find It out? And where do
you get your nerve from, anyway? A
little beggar like you to refuse an offer
from the T. T. and sit hatching your
schemes on your little old 'steen dollars
a week! â¢ â¢ â¢ It'll have to be twice
â¢steen, now, I suppose?"
"All right. Just as you say." I
laughed. "But why aren't you In tha
Trust. FrÂ«d ObennullerT"
"Why aren't you in society, Nance?"
"Um!â well, because society** preju
diced against lifting, but the Trust
isn't. Do you know that's a great
graft, Mr. Obermullerâ lifting whole
sale? Why don't you get In?"
"Because a trust Is a lot of sailor*
on a raft who keep their places by
kicking off the drowning hands that
clutch at it. Can you fancy a- fellow
like Tausig stooping down to help mo
tenderly on board to divide the pick
ings?"
"No. but I can fancy you grappling
with him till he'd be glad to takÂ« you
on rather than be pulled off himself."
"You'd be in with the push, would
you, Olden, if you were managing?" he
asked with a grin.
"I'd be at the top wherever that
was."
"Then why the deuce didn't you Jump
at Tausig's offer? Were you really
crafty enoughâ"
"I am artiste. Monsieur Obermuller,"
I gutturaled like Mademoiselle Plcotte.
who dances on tha wire. "I moost have
about me those who arre â who arre
congeniale â "
"You monkey!" he laughed. "Then,
when Tauslg comes to buy your con
tractâ"
"We'll tell him to go to thunder."
He laughed. Say, Mag, that big fel
low Is like a boy when he's pleased. I
guess that's what makes it such fun to
please him.
"And I, who admired your business
sagacity in holding off, Nance!" he
said.
"I thought you admired my take-off
of Mademoiselle ricotte."
""Well?"
"Well, why don't you make use of it?
Take me round to the theaters and
let me mimic. all the swell actors and
actresses. I've Rot more chance with
you than with that Trust gang. They
wouldn't give me room to do ray own
stunt; they'd make me fit Into theirs.
But youâ"
"But me! You think you can wind
me round your finger'"
"Notâ yet."
He chuckled. I thought I had him
going. I saw Nance Olden spending
her evenings at the big Broadway
theaters, when. Just at that .minute.
Ginger, the call-boy, burst in with, a
note.
Say, Mag, I wouldn't like to get that
man Obermuller hopping mad at me.
and Nancy Olden' s no coward, either.
But the way he gritted his teeth at
that note and the devil in his eyes when
he lifted them from it, made me wonder
how I'd ever dared be facetious with
him.
I got up to go. He'd forgotten me,
but he looked up then.
"That was a great suggestion of
yours. Olden, to put Lord Gray on to
act himselfâ great!" His voice shook,
he was so angry.
"Well!" I snapped. I wasn't going to
let htm see that a bis man raging
could bluff Nance Olden.
What did he mean? Whyâ Just this:
there was Lord Harold Gray, the real
Lord behind the scenes, bringing the
Lady who was really only a chorus
girl to the show in his automobile;
helping her dress like a maid; holding
her box of Jewels as he tagged after
her like a big Newfoundland; smoking
his one cigarette solemnly and admir
ingly while she was on the stage; pok
ing after her like a tame bear. He's a
funny fellow, that Lord Harold. He's
a Tom Dorgan, with the brains and tha
graft andâ and the brute, too, Mag.
washed out of him; a Tom Dorgan
that's been kept dressed in swagger
clothes all his life and living at top
notchâa big, clean, handsome, stupid,
good-natured, overgrown boy.
Yes, I'm coming to it. When I'd seen
him go tagging after her chippy lady
ship behind the scenes long enough, I
told Obermuller one day that It was
absurd to send the mocic lady out on
the boards and keep the live Lord
hidden behind. He Jumred at the Idea,
and they rigged up a 111 tie act for the
twoâ the Lord and the Lady. Gray
was furious when she heard of itâ their
making use of her Lord; In such a way
â but Lord Harold Just' swallowed his
big Adam's apple with x gulp, or t. j,
and said:
" 'Pon honor, it's a blawsted scheme,
you know; but I'm Jolly sure I'd make
a bleddy ass of myself.. I cawn't act,
you know."
The ninny! You know be thinks
Gray really can.
But Obermuller explained to" him that
he needn't actâ Just be himself out be
hind the wings, and lo! Lord Harold
was "chawmed."
And Gray?
Why, she gave in at last; pretended
to, anywayâ sliding out of the Charity
sketch, and rehearsing the thing -with
him, .and all that. Andâ and do you
know what she did, Mag? (Nance" Old
en may , be pretty mean, but she
wouldn't do a trick like that) She
waited till ten minutes before time for
the thing to be put on and then threw
a fit
"She's so ill, her delicate Ladyship!
So 111 she Just can't go on this evening!
Wonder how long she thinks such an
excuse will keep Lord Harold off when
I want him on!" growled Obermuller.
THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CAffi
Â¦ â¢
clean and spick ana span andâ not In
It; not even on the edge of itâ stormed
up to Obermuller standing at the wings.
"I'll quit the show here and now,"
she squawked. "It's a shame, a beastly
shame. How dare you play me such a
trick, Fred Obermuller? I never was
treated so In my lifeâ to have that dirty
little wretch come tumbling: on like
that, without even so much as your
telling me you'd made up all this new
business for her! It's Indecent, any
way. Why, I lost my cue. There was
a gap for a full minute. The whole act
was such a ghastly failure that Iâ"
"That you'd better go out now and
make your prettiest bow, Gray. Phew!
Listen to , the house roar. That's what
I call applause. .Go on now."
She went.
Me? I didn't say a word. I looked
at Obermuller andâ and I Just did like
this. Yes," winked, Mag Monahan. I
was so crazlly happy, I had to. didn't I?
But do you know what he did? Do
you know what he did?
"Well, I suppose I am screaming and
the Troyons will put me out, butâ he
Just â winkedâ back!
And then Gray came trailing back
into the wings, and the shrieking and
thumping and whistling, out in front
just went onâ and on â and on â and on.
I'm!. I Just listened and loved itâ
every thump of it.. And I stood there
like a demure little kitten; or more like
Mag Monahan after she'd had a good
licking, and was good and quiet And
I never so much as budged till Ober
muller said:
"Well, Nance, you have . earned it.
2she usedto be a good mimic herself,
before she tried to be a leading lady).
It spoils you. this sense of safeness
that goes with the honesty graft. You
lose the quickness of the hunter and
the nerve of the hunted. And â worse
â you lose your taste for the old risky
life. You grow proud and fat, and you
love every stick in. the dear, quiet lit
tl*- place that's your home â your own
homf-. You love it so that you'd be
ashamed to sneak, round where it
coultl see you â you who'd always
walked uprigh^before it with the step
of the mistress; with nothing in the
world to be ashamed of; nothing to
prevent your staring each honest dish
ran 'n the face!
And. Mag, you try â if you're me â to
fit Tom Dorian in here â Tom Dorgan
in; stripes and savage sulks still â all
these monthsâ kept away from the
world, even the world behind bars!
Maggie, don'i you wish Tom was a
venlriloquirt or â or an acrobat or â
but this isn't what I had to tell you.
Do you know what a society enter
tainer i.Â«. Miss Monahan? No? Well,
look at me. Yes, I'm one. Miss Nance
Olden, whose services are worth $50
a night â at least, they were one night.
Ginger brought me the note that made
me a society entertainer. It was from
a Mrs. Paul B. Gates, who had been
'charmed by your clever impersona
tions, Miss Olden, and write to know
if you have the leisure to entertain
some friends at my house on Thursday
of this week."
Had I the leisure â well, rather! I
showed the note to Gray, just to make
her jealous. (Oh, yes, she'goes on all
right in the act with Lord Harold
every night. Catch her letting me
wear those things of hers twice!) Well,
she just turned up her nose.
Â¦ Of course, you won't accept?" she
said.
"Of course. I will."
"Oh! I only thought you'd feel as
I should about appearing before, a lot
of snobs, who'll treat you like a serv
ant uhd â "
"Who'll do nothing of the sort and
who'll pay you well for it," put in
Obermullt-r. He had come up and
was reading the note I had handed to
him. "You just say yes, Nance," he
v.-ent on, after Gray had bounced oft
to her dressing-room. "It isn't such
a bad gr&ft and â and this is just be
tween us two, mind â that little beg
g:ar, Tausig, has begun his tricks since
you turned his offer down. They can
make things hot for me, and if they
do, it won't be so bad for you to go in
for this sort of thing â unless you go
over to the Trust â "
I shook my head.
"Well, this thing will be an ad for
you, besides â if the papers can be got
to notice it. They're coy with their
notices,\confound them, since Tausig
let them know that big Tryst ads don't
appear in the same papers -that boom
anti-Trust shows!"
"How long are you going to stand
it, Mr. O?"
"Just as long as I can't help my
self; not a minute longer.",
"There ought to be a way â some
wayâ-"
"Yes, there ought, but. there isn't.
They've got things down to a fine
point, and the fellow they don't fear
has got to fear them. Â» â¢ * i'\\
put your number early to-night, so
that you can get off by nine. Good
luck, Nance."
At nine, then, behold Nancy Olden
in her white muslin dress, long-sleeved
and high-necked, and just to her shoe
tops, with a big white muslin sash
around her waist. Oh, she's no baby,
is Nance, but she looks like one in this
rig with her short hair â or rather, like
a schoolgirl; which makes the stunts
she does in mimicking the corkers of
the profession all the more surprising.
"We're just a little party," said Mrs.
Paul^Gates, coming into the bedroom
where I was talking off my wraps.
"And I'm so glad you could come, for
my principal guest, Mr. Lalimer, is an
invalid, who used to love the theaters,
but hasn't been to one since his attack
mary years ago. I count on your giv
ing him, in a way, a condensed history
in action of what is going on on the
stage."
I told her I would. But I didn't just
know what I was saying.^ Think of
Latimer there. Maggie, an'd think of
our last meeting! It made me tremble.
Not that I fancied for a moment he'd
betray me. The man that helps you
twice don't hurt you the third time.
No, it wasn't that; it was only that I
longed to do well â well before him,
so that â
And then I found myself in an al
cove off the parlors, separated from
tfiem by heavy curtains. It was such
a pretty little red bower.* Right be
hind me was the red of the Turkish
drapery of a cozy corner, and just as
I took my place under the great chan- v
delier, the servants pulled the curtains
apart and the lights went out in the
parlors.
In that minute I got it, Mag â yes,
stage fright. Got it bad. I suppose it
was coming to me, but Lordy! I hadn't
ever known before what it w I
could see the black of the men's
clothes in the long parlors in front of
me, and the white of the women's
necks and arms. There wÂ«re soft ends
of talk trailing after the first silence,
and everything was so strange that I
P' ned to hear two --.en's voices
which sounded familiar â Latimer's
silken voice, and another, a heavy,
coarse bass, that was the last to be
quieted.
I fancied that when that last voice
should stop I could begin, but all at
once my mind seemed to turn a som
er:ault, and, ii.stead of looking out up
on them, I seemed to be looking in on
myselfâ to nee a white-faced little girl
in a white dress, standing alone under
a blaze of light in a glare cf red, maz
ing fearfully at this queer, new audi
ence.
Fail? Me?, Not Nancy. Maggie. I
just took me by the shoulders.
"Nancy Olden, you little' thief!" I
cried to me inside of me. "How dare
you! I'd rather you'd steal the- silver
on' this woman's dressing-table than
cheat her out of what she expects and
what's coming to her."
. Nance really didn't dare. So she be
gan.
The first one was kad. I gave 'em
Duse's Francesca; You've never heard
the walling music in that woman's
voice when she says:
"There Is no escape, Smaragdl. Tou have
tain It;
The shadow In a glas3 to me, and God
Lets me be Io3t."
1 gave them Duse just to show them
how swell I was myself; which shows
what a ninny I was. The thing the
world loves Is the opposite of what it
is. The pat â pat â pat of their gloves
came in to me when I go^ through.
They were too polite to hiss. But it
wasn't necessary. I was hissing my
self. Insider of me there was a long,
nasty hiss-ss-ss!
1 couldn't bear' it. I couldn't bear
. to be a failure with Latimer listening,
though out there in that queer half
light I couldn't see him at all, but
could only make out the couch where
I knew ho must be lying.
I just jumped into something else to
retrieve myself. I can do Carter's Du
Barry to the Queen's taste, Maggie.
That rotten voice of hers, like Mother
Douty's, but stronger and surer; that
rocky old face pretending to look
young and beautiful inside that tal
ented red hair of hers; that whining
"Denny! Denny!" she squawks out
every other minute. ' Oh, 1 can do Du
Barry all right!
They thought I could, too, those
black and white shadows out there on
the other side of the velvet curtains.
But I cared less for what they thought
than for the fact that I had drowned
that sputtering hiss-ss-ss inside of me,
and that Latimer was among them.
I gave them Warfleld, then; I was
always good at taking off the sheenies
in the alley behind the Cruelty â re
member? I gave them that little
pinch-nosed Maude Adams, and dry,
corking little Mrs. Fiske, and Henry
Miller when he smooths down his
white " breeches lovingly and singa
"Sally in Our Alley,'* and strutting old
Mansfield, and â
Say, isn't it funny, Mag, that I've
seen 'em all and know all they can
do? They've been my college educa
tion, that crowd. Not a bad one,
either, when you come to think of
what I wanted from it.
They pulled the curtain down at the
end and I went back to the bedroom.
I had my hat and jacket on when Mrs.
Gates and some of the younger ladies
came to see me there, but I caught: no
glimpse of Latimer. You'd thinkâ
wouldn't you â that he'd have made an
opportunity to say just one nice word
to me in that easy, soft voice of his?
I tried to believe that perhaps he
hadn't really seen me, lying down, as
he must have. been, or that heV hadn't
. recognized" me,- but,; I knevv'^that T
couldn't . make ,beliftvÂ©**i that;
and the lack of justUhat word from
him spoiled all 'my^satisfactiqn&with
myself, and 1 walked out wlfhV Mrs.
Gates through the hull and/pasfthe
dining-room feelingas hurt as though
I'd deserved that a man like Latimer
should notice me.
The dining-room was all lighted, but
empty^âthe colored, shaded candle
sticks glowing down on the cut glass
and silver, , on delicate china and
flowers. The ladies and gentlemen
hadn't come out to supper yet; at
least, only one was there. He was
standing with his back to me, before
the sideboard, pouring out a glass of
something from a decanter. He
turned at the rustle of my starched
skirt, and, as I passed the door, he saw
me. I saw him, too, and hurried
away.
Yes, I knew him. Just you wait.
I got home here earlier than I'd ex
pected, and I'd just go-off my hat and
Jacket and put away that snug~little
check when there came a ring at the
bell.
I thought it was you, Mag â that
you'd your key. I was so
sure of it that I pulled the door wide
with a flourish and â
And admitted â Edward!
Yes, Edward, husband of the Dowa
ger. The same red-faced, big-necked
old fellow, husky-voiced with whisky
now, just as he was before. He must
havj been keeping it up steadily ever
since the day out in the country when
Tom lifted his watch. It'll take more
than one lost watch to cure Edward.
"I â followed you home. Miss Murie,
son," he said, grabbing me by the
hand and pushing the door closed be
hind him. "Or Is it Miss Murieson?
Which is your stage name, and which
your real one? And have you really
learned to remember it? For my part,
any old nameiwlll smell as sweet, now
that I'm. close to the rose."
I jerked my hand away from him.
I didn't ask you to call," I said,
haughty as the Dowager herself was
when first I saw her in her gorgeous
parlor,-the Bishop's card in her hand.
"No, I noticed that," he roared jovi
ally. "You skinned out the front door
the mpment you saw me. All that was
left to me was to skin after."
"Why? 11 A?:
"Why!" He slapped his leg as
though he'd heard the best joke in the
world. "To renew our acquaintance,
of course. To ask you if you wouldn't
like me to buy you a red coat and hat
like the one you left behind you that
day over in Phlladelphia.^when you
cut your visit so short. To insist upon
my privilege of relationship. To call
that wink you gave me in the hall that
cay, you little devil. Now, don't look
at me like that. I say, let's be friends;
won't you?"
"Not for a red coat trimmed with
chinchilla," I. cried.
He got between me and the door.
"Prices gone up?" he inquired
pleasantly. "Who's bulling., the
stock?"
"Never you ; mind, so . long as hi3
name. isn't Ramsey."
"But why shouldn't his' name be
Ramsey?" he, cooed. .. .
"Just because it isn't. I'm expect
ing a. friend. Hadn't- you better go
home to Mrs. Dowager Diamonds?"
"Bully! Is that what you call her?
No, I'll stay and meet your friend."
"Better not."
"Oh; I'm not afraid. Does he know'
as much about you as I do?"
"More."
"About your weakness for other
girls' coats?"
"Yes."
"Yes."
You do know it all. don't you? And
yet you care for me, Maggie Monahan!
I retreated before him into the din
ing-room. What in the world to do to
get rid of him!
â¢ "I think you'd better go home, Mr.
Ramsay," I said again, decidedly. "If
you don't, I'll have to call the janitor
to put you out."
. "Call, sweetheart. He'll put you out
with me; for I'll tell him a thing or
two about you, and we'll go and find a
better place than this. Stock can't be
quoted so high, after all, if this is the
best prospectus your friend can put
up. . . . -Why don't you call?"
I looked at him: I was thinking.
"Well?" he demanded.
"I've changed my mind.'V
Oh, Mag, Mag,. did you ever see the
man â ugiy as a cannibal he may be
and old as the cannibal's great-grand
father â that couldn't be persuaded he
was a lady-killer? .
His manner changed altogether. He
plumped down on the lounge arid
patted the place beside him invitingly,
giving me a wink that was deadly.
"But, Mrs. Dowager!" I exclaimed
coquettlshly.
" "Oh, that's all right, little one! She
hasn't even misseVl me yet. When she's
playing bridge she forgets even to be
jealous."
"Playing bridge," I murmured
sweetly, "way off in Philadelphia,
while you, you naughty man â "
Oh, he loved that!
"Not so naughty asâ as I'd like to
be," he bellowed, heavily witty, "And
she isn't 'way off in Philadelphia either.
She's just round the corner at Mrs.
Gates', andâ what's the matter?" '
"Nothingâ nothing. Did she recognize
me?"
"Oh, that's what scared you. is it?
She didn't recognize you. Neither did
I till I got that second glimpse of you
with your hat and Jacket on. But even
if she hadâ ho! ho! ho! I say; do you
know, you couldn't convince the Bishop
and Henrietta, if you'd talk till dooms
day, that that red coat and hat we
advertised weren't taken by a little girl
that was daffy. Fact; I swear .it!
They admit you- took the coat, you little
witch, but it was when you .were out
of Your mind â of. courseâ of course!
'Ihe very fact, that she left the coat
behind her and took nothing else from
the house^showf^a.-mind diseased,' in
sisted Henrietta. "Of course â of course!
'And her coming for no reason at all to
your house,' adds the -Bishop. Say,
what was the reason?" .
Maggie, I'll tell you. a hard thing; it
isn't when people think worse of you
than you are, but better, that you feel
most uncomfortable. - 1 got pale and
sick inside of me at the thought of my
poor little Bishop. I loved him for be
lieving me straight and â Â¦
"I've been dying of curiosity to know
what was in your wise little head that
day," he went on. "Qh, it was wise
all right; that wink you gave me was
perfectly sane; there was method in
that madness of yours."
"I will tell you," Mr. Ramsay," I said
sweetly, "at supper."
"Supper!"
"Yes, the supper you're going to get
for me."
His bellowing laughter filled the
place. Maggie, our little flat and our
few things don't go well with sounds
like that.
"Oh, you're all alike, you women!"
he. roared. "All right, supper it Is.
Where shall we go â Rector's?"
I pouted.
"It's so much more cosy right here,"
I said. "I'll telephone. There's Bro
phy's, just round the, corner, and they
send in the loveliest things."
"Oh, they do! Well, tell 'em to begin
sending."
I * thought he'd follow me out
in the hall to the phone, but he
was having some trouble in pulling
out his purse â to count out his money,
I suppose. _ I got Central and asked
for the number. Oh, yes, I knew it all
right; I had. called up that same num
ber once, already, to-day. Brophy's?
Why, Maggie Monahan, you ought to
know " there's no Brophy's. At least
none that I ever heard about.
With my hand over the mouthpiece,
so that nobody heard but Edward, I
ordered a supper fit for a king â or a
chorus girl! What didn't I order!
Cham'pagno, broiled lobster, crab meat,
stuffed pimentoes, kirschkaffee â every- j
thing I'd ever heard Beryl Blackburn
tell about. . y.- ''"
"Say, say," interruptedr^dwani, com
ing out after me. "That's' enough of !
that stuff. Tell him r^-^jr^ ,in : ai
Scotch and soda and â what â â¢ ; ,;--
For at that moment the connection"
was made and I cut in sweetly with:
"Mrs. Edward Ramsey?â just a min
ute."
Mag, you should have seen the man's
face! It was red, it was white; it was
furious, it was frightened.
I put my hand over the mouthpiece
and turned en him then. "I've 'got her
on the 'phone at Mrs. Gates' house.
Shall I tell your wife where you are,
Edward? â¢ â¢ * Just a moment,
Mrs. Ramsay, hold the wire; somo one
wants to speak with you."
"You little devil!" His voice was
thick with rage.
"Yes, you called me that some time
ago, but not in that tone. Quick, nowâ
the door or â¢ ' â¢ â¢ Waiting. Mrs.
throwing her note over to me. He'd
have liked to throw it at me If it'd
been heavy enough to hurt; he was so
thumping mad.
You see,, there it wps on the pro
gramme:
THH CLEVER SKETCH ENTITLED
THEATRICAL ARISTOCRACY.
The Duke of Portmanteau. ..Lord Harold Gray
The Duchess Lady Gray
No wonder Obermuller was raging. I
looked at him. You don't like to tackle
a fellow like that when he's dancing
hot. And yet you ache to help *hlm
and â yes, yourself.
â¢Lord Harc-ld's here yet, and the jew
els?" I asked.
He gave a short nod. He was think
ing. But 6O was I.
"Then all he wants is a Lady?"
"That's all," he said sarcastically.
"Well, what's the matter with me?"
He gasped.
"There's nothing the matter with
your nerve, Olden."
"Thank you so much." It was the
way Gray says it when she tries to
have an English accent. "Dress me up,
Fred Obtrmuller, in Gray's new silk
gown ar.d the Gray jewels, and you'd
never â "
"I'd never set eyes on you again."
"You'd never know, if you were in
the audience, that it wasn't Gray her
self. I can take her off to the life, and
if the prompter'll stand by â "
He looked at me for a full minute.
'Try it. Olden," he said.
I did. I flew to Gray's dressing-room.
She'd gone home deathly ill, of course.
They gave me the best seamstress in
the place. She let out the waist
a bit and ;mlled over the lace to cover
it. I got into that mass of silk and
la.ee â oh, silk on silk, and Nance Ol
den inside! Beryl Blackburn did my
hair, and Grace Weston put on my
slippers. Topham, himself, hung me
with those gorgeous shining diamonds
and pearls and emeralds, till I felt
!ik<? an idol loaded with booty. There
were so many standing round me, rig
ging me up, that I didn't get a glimpse
of the mirror till the second before
Ginger called me. But in that second
in that second, Mag Monahan, I saw
a fairy with blazing cheeks and shin
ing eyes, with a diamond coronet in
her brown hair, puffed high, and
pearls on her bare neck and arms, and
emeralds over the waist, and rubies
and pearls on her fingers, and sprays
of diamonds like frost on the lace of
her skirt, and diamond buckles on her
very slippers, and the rose diamond,
like a sun, outshining all the rest;
and â and, Mag, it was me!
How did it so? Well, wouldn't it
make you think you were a Lady, sure
enough, if you couldn't move without
that lace train billowing after you;
without being dazzled with diamond
shine; without a truly Lord tagging
after you ?
He kept his head, Lord Harold did
â even if it is a. mutton-head. That
helped me at first. He was so cold,
so stupid, so slow, so good-tempered
â so just himself. And after the
first plunge â
I tell you, Mag Monahan, there's
one thing that's stronger than wine to
a woman â it's being beautiful. Oh!
And I was beautiful. I knew it before
I got tha.t quick hush, with the full
applause after it. And because I was
beautiful, I got saucy, and then calm,
and then I caught Fred Obermuller's
voice â lie had taken the book from
the prompter and stood there himself
â and after that it was easy sailing.
He was there yet when the act was
over, and I trailed out, followed by
my Lord. He let the prompt-book fall
from his hands and reached them both
out to me.
I flirted my jeweled fan at him and
swept him a courtesy.
Cool? No, I wasn't. Not a bit of it.
He was daffy with the sight of me In
a.11 that glory, and I knew it.
"Nance," he whispered, "you won
derful girl, if I didn't know about that
iittle thief up at the Bronsonia I'd â
I'd marry you alive, jnst for the fun
of piling pretty things on you."
"The deuce you would!" I sailed
past him, with Topham and my Lord
in my wake.
They didn't leave me till they'd
stripped me clean. I felt like a
Christmas tree the day after. But,
somehow, I didn't care.
Is that you, Mag? Well, it's about
time you came home to look after me.
Fine chaperon you make. Miss Mona
han! Why, didn't I tell you the very
day we took this flat what a chaperon
was, and that you'd have to be mine?
Imagine Nancy Olden without a chap
eron. Shocking!
No, 'tisn't late. Sit down, Magpie,
there, a'nd let me get the stool and
talk to you. Think of us two â Cruelty
girls, both of us â two mangy kittens
deserted by the old cats in a city's al
leys, and left mewing with cold and
hunger and dirt, out in the wet â think
Â«jf us two In our own flat. Mag!
I say, it makes me proud of us!
There are times when I look at every
stick of furniture we own, and I try
to pretend to it all that I'm used to
a decent roof over my head, and a
dining-room, kitchen, parlor, bed
room and bath. Oh, and I forgot the
telephone the .other tenant left here
till its lease is up. But at other times
I stand here in the middle of it and
cry out to it, in my heart:
"Look at me. Nancy Olden, a house
holder, a rent-payer, the head of the
family, even if it's only a family of
two and the other one Mag! Look at
me. with my name In the directory,
a-payins: milk bills and meat bills and
bread bills! Look at me with a place
of my own. where nobody's right's
greater than my own; where no one
has a right but me and Mag; a place
where â where there's nothing to hide
from the police!"
There's the rub, Mag, as Hamlet
s;:ys â (I went to see it the other night,
fo that I could take off the Ophelia
Ramsay?"
He moved toward the door.
"How'll I know you won't tell her
when I'm gone?" he growled.
"Merely by my saying that I won't,"
I answered curtly. "You're in no po
sition to dictate terms; I am."
But I could, without leaving the
'phone, latch the chain on "the door be
hind him, leaving it half open. So he
must have heard the rest.
. ."Yes, Mrs. Ramsay, waiting?" I
â¢ croaked like the driest kind of hello
girl. "I was mistaken. ' It was a mes
sage left to be delivered to you â not
some one wanting to speak with you.
Who am I? Why, this is Central. Here
is the message: 'Will be with you in
half an hour.' Signed 'Edward.' '*.-.*'Â¦'.*}
Yes. that's right. Thank you. Good
night."
I hung up, gave - the door a
touch that shut it in his face
and went back into the dining-room to
throw open the windows. The place
smclled of alcohol; . the moral atmos
phere left behind by that bad old man
sickened fnc._.
I leaned out and looked at the stars
and tried to think of something sweet
i and wholesome and strengthening.
"Ah, Nance," I cried V> myself with
a sobâ I had pretended to take it lightly
enough when he was here, but now â
"if you had heard of a girl who, like
yourself this evening," unexpectedly
met two men she had known, and the
good man ignored her and the bad one
followed herâ oh, Nancyâ what sort of
girl would you think she was at heart?
What sort of hope could you imagine
' her treasuring for her own future? And
what sort of significance would you at
tach to â " .'
And^just then the bell rang again.
This time \ was sure it was you. And.
Oh, Maggie, I ran to the door eager
for the touch of your hand and the Jook
in your eyes. I was afraid to be alone
with my own thoughts. I was afraid
of the conclusion to which they were
leading me. Maggie, if ever a girl need
ed comfort and encouragement and
heartening, I did then.
And I got it, dear.
For there was a man at the door,
with a great basket of azaleasâ pale,
pink earth-stars they are. the sweet,
innocent thingsâ and a letter for me.
Here it is. Let me read it to you.
"My Dear Miss Omarâ Once upon a
time there was a Luckless Pot, marred
in the making, that had the luck to be'
of service to a Pipkin.
"It was a saucy Pipkin, though a
very winning one, and it had all tha
health and strength the poor Pot lacked
âphysically. Morally â morally, that
young Pipkin was in a most unwhole
some condition. Already its fair,
smooth surface was, scratched and
fouled. It was unmindful of the treas
ure of good it contained, and its re
sponsibility to keep that good intact.
And it seemed destined to crash itself
to pieces among pots of baser metal.
"What the Luckless Pot did was lit
tleâbeing ignorant of the art by which
diamonds may ' be attained easily and
honestlyâ but it gave the little Pipkin
achance. .... . ..~~-..-~. ..- .
"What the Pipkin did with that
chance, the Pot learned to-night,
with . such pleasure . and satisfac
tion as made it impossible for him not
to share it with her. So while he sent
Burnett out to the conservatory to cut
azaleas, he wrote her a note to try to
convey to. her what he felt when, in
that nicely polished, neatly decorated
and self-respecting vessel on exhibition
in Mrs. Gates* red room, he recognized
the poor little Pipkin of other days./:. :::â¢ '
"The Pot, as you know, was a sort of
stranded bit of clay that had never
filled the use for which pots are cre
ated. He ha/i little human to interest
him. The fate of the Pipkin, therefore, t
he had often pondered on, and in spite
of improbabilities had had faith in a
certain quality of braye sincerity the
little thing showedâ a quality that
shone through acquired faults like a
star in a murky sky.
"This justification of his fafth in the
Pipkin may. seem a small matter to
make so much of. And yet the Pot
that sleeDa not well o' nights, as is the
case with damaged pots â will take to
bed with him to-night a pretty, pleas
ant thought, due just to this.
"But do not think the Pot an idealist.
If he were he might. have been tempted
to mistake the Pipkin for a statelier;
more pretentious Vessel â a Vase, say,
all 'graceful curves and embossed sides,
but shallow, perhaps, possibly lacking
breadth. No, the Pipkin is a pipkin,
made of common clayâ even though It
has the uncommon ' sweetness and
strength to overcome the tendencies of
clayâ and fashioned for those common
uses of. life, deprivation of which to
anything that comes from the Potter's
hands' is the" most erlduring, the most
uncommon sorrow.
"6K pretty little Pipkin, thank the
Potter, who made you as you are, as
you will be â a thing that can cheer and
stay men's souls by ministering to the
human needs of them. For you, be
sure, the Potter's ,'a good fellow and
ItwIH all be well.'
I "For the Pot â he sails shortly, or
father he is to be carted abroad by
some optimistic friends whose hopes he
does not share â to a celebrated repair
shop for damaged pots. Whether he
shall return patched and mended into
temporary semblance of a useful Ves
'sel; whether he shall continue to be
merely the same old Luckless Pot, or
whether he shall return at all, O Pip
kin, does not matter much.
"But it has been well that, before we
two behind the veil had passed, we met
again, and you left me such a fragrant
memory. LATIMER."
. . â¢
Oh, Maggie, Maggie, some day I hope
to see that man and tell him how sore
ly the Pipkin needed the Pot's letter!
; y,Â« ix.
It's all come so quick, Maggie, and
it was over so soon that I hardly re
member the beginning.
Nobody on earth could have expected
it less than I, when I came off in the
afternoon. I don't know what I wa3
thinking of as I came into my dress
ing-room, that used to be Gray's â the
sight of him seemed to cut me off from
myself as with a knifeâ but it wasn't
of him.
It may have been that I was chuck
ling 1 to myself at the thought of Nancy
Olden with a dressing-room all to her
self. I can't. ever quite get used to that,
you know, though' I sail around there
with all the airs of a leading lady.
Sometimes I see a twinkle in Frtd
Obermuller's eyo when I catch him
watching me, and goodness knows he's
been glum enough of late, but it
wasn'tâ -
Yes, I'm going to tell you, butâ It's
rattled me a bit, Maggie. I'm ro â so
sorry, and a littleâ oh, just a little, lit
tle bit glad!
I'd slammed the door behind meâ the
old place is out of repair and the door
won't shut except with a bangâ and I
had just squatted down on the floor
to unbutton my high schoes. when I
noticed the chintz curtains in front of
the high dressing-box waver. Thoy
must have moved just like that when
1 1 ' was behind them months â it seems
yearsâ ago. But, you see. Topham had
never served an apprenticeship behind
curtains, so he didn't suspect.
"Lordy, Nancy," I laughed to myself,
"some one thinks you've got a rose
diamond and â "
-And at that moment he parted the
curtains and came out.
Tes â Tom â Tom Dorgan.
My heart came beating up to my
throat' and then, just a3 I thought I
should choke, it slid down to my boots,
sickening me. I didn't say a word. I
sat there, my foot in my lap, staring at
him.
Oh. Maggie-girl, it isn't good to get
your first glimpse after all these
months of the man you love crouched
like a big bull in a small space, poking
his close-cropped black head out like
a turtle that's not sure something
won't be thrown at it. and then drag
ging his big hulk out and standing
over you. He used to be trimâ Tomâ
and taut, but in those shapeless things,
the old trousers; the dirty white shirt,
and the vest too big for him â
>."WeIl," he said, "why don't you say
something?"
Tom's voice â Map:, do you remember,
the merry Irish boy's voice, with its
chuckles like a brook gurgling as It
runs?
No â 'tisn't the same voice. It's â it's
changed, Maggie. It's heavy andâ and
coarse â andâ brutal. That's what it is.
It sounds likeâ like the knout, likeâ
"Nance â what in hell's â "
"I think I'm frightened.Tom."
"Oh, the ladyfled airs of her! Ain't
you going to faint, Miss Olden?"
I got up.
"No â no. Sit down. Tom. Tell me
about it. How â how did you get here?"
. He went to the door, opened it a bit
and looked out cautiously. Magâ Mag
âit hurt meâ that. Why, do you sup
pose?
"You're sure nobody'll come in?" he
asked.
â¢ I turned the key in the lock, forget
ting that it didn't really lock.
"Oh, yes. I'm sure," I said. "Why?"
"Why! You have got slow. Just be
cau*se I didn't say good-by to them fel
lows up at the Pen, and â "
"Oh! You've escaped!"
"That's what. First jail-break in
fifteen years. What d'ye think of your
Tommy, old girl, eh? Ain't he the
gamest? Ain't you proud of him?"
My God. Mag! Proud of him. He
didn't knowâ he couldn't seeâ himself.
He, shut in like a wild beast, couldn't
see what this year has done for him.
Oh, the changeâ the change In him! My
boy Tommy.' with the gay. gallus man
ner, and the pretty, jolly brogue, and
laughing mouth under his brown
mustache. And this manâ his face is
old, Mag, oldâ oh!â and hardâ and â
tough, cheap and tough. There's some
thing in his eyes now and about hi3
shaven mouth â oh, Maggie, Maggie!
"Look here, Nance." He caught ma
by the shoulders, knocking up my chin
so that he could look down squarely at
me. "What's your graft? What's it to
be between us? What've ye been doing
all this time? Out with It! I -want to
know."
I shook myself free and faced him.
"I've beenâ Tom Dorgan, I've been
to hear the greatest actors and art
resses in the world say and do the
finest things in the world. I've watched
Princesses and Kingsâ even if they're
only stage ones. I've read a new book
every nightâ a great picture book, in
which the pictures move and speak â
that's the stage, Tom Dorgan. Much of
it wasn't true, but a girl who'a been
brought up by the Cruelty doesn't have
to be told what's true and what's false.
I've rriet these people and lived with
them â as one does who thinks the same
thoughts and feels what others feel.
I know " the world now, Tom Dorgan,
the real world of men and womenâ
not the little world of crooks, nor yet
the littler one of fairy, stories. I've got
a glimpse, too, of that other world
where all the scheming and lying and
cheating is changed as if by magic into
something that deceives all, right, but
doesn't hurt. It's the world of art and
artists, Tom Dorgan. where people
paint their lies, or write them, or act
them; where they lift money all right
from men's pockets, but lift their souls
and their lives, too, away from the
things that trouble and bore andâ and
degrade.
"You needn't sneer; it's made a dif
ferent Nance out of me, Tom Dorgan.
And. oh. but I'm sorry for the pert
little beggar we both knew that lied
and stole and hid and ran and skulked?
She was like a poor little ignorant
traveler in a great country where she'd
sized uo the world from the few fool
crooks she was thrown in with. She â '*
"Aw, cut it!"
"Tom â does â doesn't it mean any
thing to you? Can't it mean, lota to
both of us now that "
"Cut it, I tell you! Think I killed
one guard and beat the other till I'd
broke every bone in his body to come
THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALL.
3"Nance!" he cried, "I don't believe a
word of it." He turned In his quick
way to the men. "What are your or
ders?"
"To take her to her fiat and search
it."
Obermuller came over to me then and
took my hand for a minute.
"It's a pity they don't know about
the Gray rose diamond," he whispered,
helping me on with my jacket. "They'd
see how silly this little $300 business
is. â¢} â¢ â¢ Brace up, Nance Olden!"
Oh, Mag, Mag, to hear a man like
thaf:talk to you as though you were
his kind, when, you have the feel of the
coarse; prison between your
dry, shaking fingers, and the close pris
on smell is already poisoning your nos
trils!. v" -
"I don't see"â my voice shook â "how
you can believe â in me."
"Don't you?" he laughed. "That's
easy. You've got brains, Nance, and
"Yes. I was sure I saw him sail,
but, of course, I, was mistaken. He has
sent you after me, has he? I can hardly
believe it of Tomâ even â even yet."
"I don't know anything that connects
you w.Ith Dorgan. If he was in with
you on this, you'd better remember,
before you say anything more, that
it'll all be used against you."
The curtain had gone down and
gene up again. I was watching
the star. She has Â¦ such a boyish
way of nodding her head, instead of
bowing, after she waddles out to the
center; and every time she wipes her
lips with her lace ' handkerchief, as
though she'd just taken one of the
cccktails she makes in the play with
all the skill of a bartender. I found
myself doing the same thingâ wiping
my lips with that very same gesture,
as though I had a fat, bare forearm
like a rolling pinâ when all at once the
thought came to me: "You needn't
bother, Nancy. It's all up. You won't
have any use for it all."
"Just what is the charge?" I asked,
turning to the man beside me.
"Stealing a purse containing $300
from Mrs. Paul Gates' house on the
night of April 27."
"What!"
It was Obermuller. He had pushed
the curtains aside; the crashing of the
orchestra had prevented our hearing
the clatter of the rings. He had pushed
by the man standing there, had come
in andâ he had heard.
the most imbecile thing you could do t
just now, when your foot is already on â¢
the ladder, would be just this â to get
oft* in order to pick up a trinket out of .
the mud, when there's a fortune at the <
top waiting for you. Clever people j
don't do asinine things. And other j
clever people know *hat they don't, j
You're clever, but so am Iâ in my ]
weak, small way. Come rlong, little (
girl." . t
' He pulled my hand in his arm and j
we walked out, followed by the two
men. â¢ j
Oh, no! It was all very quiet and 1
looked just like a little theater party 1
that had an early supper engagement. 1
Obermuller nodded to the manager out \
in the deserted lobby, who stopped us 1
and asked me what I thought of the t
star. i
You'll think me mad, Mag. Those <
fellows with the badges were sure I <
was, but Obermuller's eyes only twin- :
kled, and the manager's grin grew <
broad when, catching up the end of
my skirt and cake-walking up and '
down, I sang under my breath that Â«
coon song that was trailing over and J
over through my head.
"Bravo! bravo!" whispered the man- !
ager, hoarsely, clapping his hands
softly. 1
I gave one of those quick, funny,
boyish nods the star inside affects and !
wiped my lips with my handkerchief.
That brought down my house. Even
the biggest fellow with the badge gig
gled recognizingly, and then put his
hand quickly in front of his mouth and ;
tried to look severe and official.
The color had come back to Ober
muller's face; it was worth dancing for
âthat.
"Be patient, Mag; let me tell It my
way." [
There 'wasn't room In the coupe '
waiting out in front for more than two.
So Obermuller couldn't come in it. But
he put me in â Mag, dear, dear Mag â
he put me In as if I was a lady â not
like Gray; a real one. A thing like that
counts when two detectives are watch
ing. It counted afterward In the way
they treated me.
The big man climbed up on the seat
with the driver. The blue-eyed fellow
Rot in and sat beside me, closing the
door.
"I'll be out there almost as soon as
you are," Obermuller said, standing a
moment beside the lowered window.
"You good fellow!" I said, and' then,
trying to laugh: "I'll do as much for
you some day."
He shook his fist laughingly at me,
and I waved my hand as we drove off.
"You know. Miss, there may be some
mistake about this," said the man next
to me, "and â "
"Yes, there may be. In fact, there
is."
"I'm sure I'll be very glad if it is a
mistake. They do happenâ though not
often. You spoke of Dorganâ"
"Did I?"
"Yes, Tom Dorgan, who busted out of
Sing Sing the other day."
"Surely you're mistaken," I said,
smiling right into his blue eyes. "The
Tom Dorgan I mentioned is a sleight
of-hand performer at the Vaudeville.
Ever see him?"
"N â no."
"Clever fellow. You ought to. Per
haps you don't recognize him under
that name. On the bills he's Professor
Haughwout. Stage people have so
many names, you know."
"Yes, so have â some other people."
I laughed, and he grinned back at
me.
"Now that's mean of you," I said;
"I never had but one. It was all I
needed."
It flashed through me then what a
thing like this might do to a name.
You know, Mag, every bit of recog
nition an actress steals from the world
is so much capital. It Isn't like the old
graft when you had to begin new every
time you took up a piece of work. And
your name â the name the world knows
â and Its knowing it makes it worth
having like everything â that name is
the sum of every scheme you've
planned, of every time you've got
got away with the goods, of every
laugh you've lifted, of every bit of
cleverness you've thought out and em
bodied, of everything that's in you, of
everything you are.
But I didn't dare think long of this.
I turned to him.
' "Tell me about this charge," I said.
"Where was the purse? Whose was it?
And why haven't they missed it till
after a week?"
"They missed it all right that night.
But Mrs. Gates wanted it kept quiet
till the servants had been shadowed
and it was positively proved that they
hadn't got away with it."
"And then she thought of me?" .
"And then ehe thought of you."
"I wonder why?"
"Because you were the only person
in that room except Mr. Gates, the lady
who lost the purse, Mrs. Ramsay, and
âeh?" ;:=:yyS
He didn't answer.
Without turning my head I repeated
the question.
And yetâ suddenlyâ before he could
have answered, I knew something was
wrong.
I turned. And in that moment a man
took the seat beside me and another
stood facing me, with his back against
the portieres. (
"Miss Olden?" the man beside me
asked.
"Yes."
"Nance Olden, the mimic, who enter
tains at private houses?"
I nodded.
"Youâ you were at Mrs. Paul Gates'
just a week ago, and you gave your
specialties there?"
"Yes â yes, what is it you want?"
He was a little man, but very muscu
lar. I could note the play of his mus
cles even in the slight motion he made
as he turned his body so as to get be
tween me and the audience, while he
leaned toward me, watching me intent
ly with his small, quick, blue eyes.
"We don't want to maxe any scene
here," he said very low. "We want to
do it up as quietly as we can. There
might be some mistake, you know, and
then you'd be sorry. So should we. I
hope you'll be reasonable and it'll be
all the better for you because â "
"What are you talkâ whatâ " I
looked from him to the other fellow
hebind us.
He leaned a bit farther forward then
and pulling his coat partly open he
showed me a detective's badge. And
.the other man quickly did the same.
I sat back in my chair. The fat star
on the stage, with her big mouth and
big baby-face, was doing a cakewalk
up and down close to the footlights,
yelling the chorus of her song.
I'll never mimic that song, Mag, al
though I can see her and hear it as
plain as though I'd listened and
watched her all my life. But there's
no fun in it for me. I hate the very
bars the orchestra plays before she. be-,
gins to sing. I can't bear even to think
of the words. The whole of it is full
of horrible things â it smells of the jail
âit looks like stripesâ Itâ .
"You're not going to faint?" asked
the man, moving closer to me.
"Me? I never fainted in my life.
Where is he now â Tom Dorgan?"
"Tom Dorgan!"
"N- nothing. Mrs. Ramsay, you
said?"
"Not Mrs. Edward Ramsay of Prnla
"Oh, you know the name?"
"Oh, yes, I know it."
"It was printed, you know, in gold
lettering on the inside flap andâ"
"I don't know." , .
"Well. It was. and it contained threo (
hundred dollars. Mrs. Ramsay says.
She had slipped it under the fold at $
the spread at the top of the bed in Â«
the room where you took vtt your \
things in Mrs. Gates' presence, and put
them on again when no one else was (
there."
"And you mean to tell me that this
is all?" I- raged at him; "that every bit
of evidence you have to warrant your
treating an innocent girl like â "
"You didn't behave like a very inni
cent girl, if you'll remember," he said /
dryly, "when I first came into the box. /
In fact, if that fellow hadn't just come j j
in then I believe you'd 'a' confessed \ J
the whole job 'Taint too late," he /
added. !
I didn't answer. I put my head back lÂ£
against the cushions ar.d closed my T
eyes. I could feel the scrutiny of his \
blue eyes on my naked faceâ your face J
is so- unprotected with the eyes closed; 2
like a fort whose battery is withdrawn. \
But I was tired â it tires you when you
cars. A year ego, Hag, this sort of i
thingâ the risk, the nearness to dan-
ger, the chance one way or the other â 1
would have intoxicated me. I used to \
feel as though I was dancing on a
volcano and daring it to explode. The
more twistings and turnings there were
to the .labyrinth, the greater glory it
was to get out. Maggie darlin', you
have before you a mournful spectacle â
the degeneration of Nancy Olden. It
isn't that she's lost courage. It's only
that she used to be able to think fÂ£
only one thing, and now â What do a
you suppose it is, Mag? If you know. Z
don't you dar3 to tell rne. I
When we got to the Hat Obermuller *
was already there. At the door I pull
ed out my key and opened it with a
flourish.
"Won't you come in, gentlemen, and
spend the evening?" I asked.
They followed me in. First to the
parlor. The two fellows threw off
their coats and searched that through
and throughâ not a drawer did they
miss, not a bit of furniture did they
fail to- move. Obermuller and I sat
there guying thorn as they pried about
in their shirt-sleeves. That Trust bus
iness has taken the life out of him of '
late. All their tricks, all their squeez- '
ings, their cheatir.gs. their bossing: and
bragging and bullying have got on to
his nerves till he looks like a chained
bear getting a drubbing. And he
swears that they're in a con
spiracy to freeze him and a few others
like him out: he believes there's act
ually a paper in existence that would
prove it. But this affair of the purse
seemed to excite him till ha behaved
like a bad schooiboy.
And I? Well, Nance Olden was never
far behind at the Cruelty when there
was anything doing on. We trailed
after them, and when they'd finished
vrith the bedrooms â your and mine â I
asked the big fellow to come into the
kitchen with Mr. O. and me, while the
blue-eyed detective tackled th>? dining
room, and I'd get up a lunch for us all.
Mag, you should have seen Fred
Obermuller with a big apron on him.
dressing the salad while I was making
sandwiches. The Cruelty taught ma
how to cook, even if it did teach me
other things. You wouldn't have be
lieved that th? Trust had got him by
the throat and was choKing the last
breath out of him. You wouldn't have
believed that our salaries hadn't been
paid for three weeks, that our house3 i
were dwindling every night, that â .*
I was thinking about it all there in 'Â»
the back of my head, trying to see a 2
way out of it â you know if there is
such an agreement as Obermuller
swears there is it's against the law
while we rattled on, the two of us. like
a couple of children on a picnic, when
I heard a crash behind me.
The salad bowl had slipped from
Obermuller's fingers. He stood with
his back turned to me, his eyes fixed
upon that searching detective.
But he wasn't searching any more,
Mag. He was standing still as a
pointer that's scented game. He had
moved the lounge out from the wall,
and there on the floor, spread open
where it had fallen, lay a handsome
elephant-skin purse, with gold corners.
From where I stood, Mag, I could read
the plain gold lettering on the dark i
leather. I didn't have to move. It wa3 ]
plain enoughâ quite plain. g
MRS. EDWARD RAMSAY. Â»
Hush, hush, Mag; if you take on so |
how can I tell you the rest? Â«
Obermuller got in front of me as I
started to walk into the dining-room.
I don't know what his idea was. I
don't suppose he does exactlyâ If it
wasn't to spare me the sight of that
damned thing.
Oh. how I hated it, that purse! I
hated it as if it had been something
alive that could be glad of what it had
; done. I wished it was alive that I could
tear and rend it and stamp on it and
throw it in a fire and drag it out
again, with burned and bleeding nails,
to tear it again and again. I wanted
to fall on it and hide it; to push it far,
far away out of sight; to stamp it
â¢ down â down into the very bottom of
[ the earth, where it could feel the hell
it was making for me. T ",
But I only stood there, stupidly '
â¢ looking at it, having pushed pa3t
I Obermuller, as though I never want
r ed to see anything else.
And then I heard that blue-eye4
fellow's words. ,::Â»-. " ;
"Well," he said, pulling on his coat
as though he'd done a good day's
t work, "I gue3S you'd just better corns
(Continued Next Sunday.)
here and listen to such guff? You've
been having a high old time, eh, and
you never give a thought to me up
there! I might 'a* rotted in that black
hole for all you'd care, you "
"Don't! I did, Tom; I did." I was
shivering at the name, but I couldn't
bear his thinking that way of me. "I
went up once, but they wouldn't let me
see you. I wrote you, but they sent
back the letters. Mag went up, too,
but had to come back. And that time
I brought you "
My voice trailed off. In that minute
I saw myself on the way up to Sing
Sing with the basket and all of my
hopes and all my schemes for amusing
him.
And this is what I'd have Been if
they'd let me in â this big, gruff, mur
dering beast!
Oh, yesâ yes â beast Is what he is,
and it didn't make him look it less that
he believed me and â and began to think
cf me In a different way.
"I thought you wouldn't go back on
a feller, Nance. That's why I come i
straight to you. It was my game to
have you hide me for a day or two, till
you could make a strike somewhere
and we'd light out together. How're
ye fixed? Pretty smart, eh? You look
it, my girl, you lookâ my eye, Nance,
you lpok good enough to eat, and I'm
hungry for you'"
Maggie, if I'd had to die for it I
couldn't have moved then. You'd think
a man would know when the woman
he's holding In his arms is faintingâ
sick at the touch of him. A woman
would. It wasn't my Tom that I'd
known, that I'd worked with and
played with and It was a great
brute, whose mouthâ who had no eyes,
no ears, no senses but â ah! â¢ â¢ â¢
He laughed when I broke away from
him at last. He laughed! And I knew
I'd have to tell him straight in words.
"Tom," I gasped, "you can have all
I've got; and it's plenty to get you out
of the way. Butâ but you can't have
â me â any more. That's â done!"
Oh, the beast in his face! It must
have looked like that when the guard
got his last glimpse at it.
'"You're kiddin' me'" he growled.
I shook my head.
Then he ripped it out. Said the worst
he could and ended with a curse! The
blood boiled in me. The old Nance
never stood that; she used to sneer
at other women who did.
"Get out of here!" I cried. "Goâ go,
Tom Dorgan. I'll send every cent I've
got to you to Mother Douty's within
two hours, but don't you dare â "
"Don't you dare, you she-devil! Just
make up your mind to drop these new
fangled airs, and mighty quick. I tell
you you'll come with me 'cause I need
you and I want you, and I want you
now. And I'll keep you when once I
get you again. We'll hang together.
No more o' this one-sided lay-out for
me, where you get all the soft and it's
me for the hard. You belong to me.
Yes, you do. Just think back a bit,
Nance Olden, and remember the kind
of customer I am. If you've forgot,
just let me remind you that what I
know would put you behind bars, my
lady, and it shall, I swear, if I've got
to go to the Chair for it!"
Tom! It was Tom talking that way
to me. I couldn't bear it. I made a
rush for the door.
He got there, too, and catching me
by the shoulder, he lifted his fist.
But it never fell, Mag. I think I
could kill a man who struck me. But
Just as I shut my eyes and shivered
away from him, while I waited for the
blow, a knock came to the door and
Fred Obermuller walked In.
"Eh? Oh! Excuse me. I didn't know
there was anybody else. Nance, your
face is ghastly. ... What's up?" he
said sharply.
He looked from me to Tomâ Tom,
standing off there ready to spring on
him, to dart past him, to fly out of the
window â ready for anything; only
waiting to know what the thing was
to be.
My senses came back to me then.
The sight of Obennuller, with those
keen, quick eyes behind his glasses,
his strong, 6quare chin, and the whole
poise of his head and body that makes
men wait to hear what he has to say;
the knowledge that that man was my
friend, mine â Nancy Olden'sâ lifted me
out of the mud I'd sunk back In, and
put my feet again on a level with
his.
'Tom," I said slowly, "Mr. Ober
muller Is a friend of mine. Noâ listen!
What we've been talking about Is set
tled. Don't bring It up again. It
doesn't interest him and It can't change
me; I swear to you, it can't; nothing
can. Tm going to ask Mr. Obennuller
to help you without telling him just
what the scrape Is, andâ and I'm going
to be sure that he'll do It Just because
heâ"
"Because you've taken up with him,
have you?" Tom shouted savagely.
"Because she's your â "
"Tom!" I cried.
"Tom â oh, yes, now I remember."
Obennuller got betwen us as he spoke.
"Your friend upâ In the country that
you went to see and couldn't. Not a
very good looker, your friend, Nance.
Butâ farming, I suppose, Mr.â Tom? â
plays the deuce with one's looks. And
another thing It does: It makes a man
forget sometimes just how to behave In
town. I'll be charmed, Mr. Tom, to
oblige a friend of Miss Olden's; but I
must Insist that he does not talk like
a â farmer."
He was quite close to Tom when he
finished, and Tom was glaring up at
him. And, Mag, I didn't know which
one I was most afraid for. Don't you
look at me that way, Mag Monahan,
and don't you dare to guess anything!
"If you think," growled Tom, '-'that
I'm going to let you get off with the
girl, you're mightyâ"
"Now, I've told you not to say that
The reason I'll do the thing she's going
to ask of meâ if it's what I think it isâ
Is because this girl's a plucky little
creature with a soul big enough to lift
her out of the muck you probably
helped her into. It's because she's got
brains, talent, and a heart. It's because
â well, it's because I feel like It, and
she deserves a friend."
"You don/ know what she is." It
was a snarl from Tom. "You don't â "
, "Oh, yes I do; you cur! I know what
she was, too. And I even know what
she will be; but that doesn't concern
you."
"The hell it don't!"
Obermuller turned his back on him.
I was dumb and still. Tom Dorgan
had struck me after all.
"What Is it you want me to do,
Nance?" Obermuller asked.
"Get him away on a steamer â quick,"
I murmuredâ I couldn't look him in the
face â "without asking why, or what
his name is." â¢
He turned to Tom. "Well?"
"I won't go â not without her."
"Because you're so fond of her, eh?
So fond, your first thought on quitting
theâ country was to come here to get
her in trouble. If you've been traced â "
"Ah! You wouldn't like that, eh?"
sneered Tom.
"Would you?"
"Well, I've had my share of it. And ;
she ain't. Stillâ I â¢ â¢ â¢ Just what
would it be worth to you to have me
out of the way?"
"Oh, Tom â Tom â " I cried.
But Obermuller got in front of me.
"It would be worth exactly one dollar
and seventy-five cents. I think it will
amount to about that for cab-hire. I
guess the cars aren't any too safe for
you, or it might be less. It may amount
to something more before I get you
shipped before the mast on the first
foreign-bound boat. But what's more
important," he added, bringing his fist
down with a mightyrthump on the
table, "you have just ten seconds to
make up your mind. At the end of that
time I'll ring for the police."
I went down to the boat to see it sail,
Mag, at 7 this morning. No, not to say
good-by to him. . He didn't know I was
there. It was to say good-by to my old
Tommy; the one I loved. Truly I did
love him, Mag, though he never cared
for me. No, he didn't. Men don't pull
down the women they love; I know
that now. If Tom Dorgan had ever
cared for me he wouldn't have made a
thief of me. If he'd cared, the last
place on earth he'd have come to, when
he knew the detectives would be on his
track, would have been just the first
place he made -for. If he'd cared, he â
But it's done, Mag. It's all over.
Cheap â that's what he is, this Tom
Dorgan. Cheaply badâ a cheap bully,
cheap-brained. Remember my wishing
he'd have been a ventriloquist? Why,
that man that tried to sell me to Ober
muller hasn't sense enough to be a
good scene-shifter. Ohâ
The firm of Dorgan & Olden Is dis
solved, Mag. The retiring partner has
gone into the theatrical business. As
for Dorgan â the real one, poor fellow!
jolly, handsome, big Tom Dorgan â he
died. Yes, he died, Maggie, and was
buried â¢ up thereV in the prison grave
yard. A hard lot for a boy; but it's
not the worst thing that can happen to
him. He might become a man; such
a man as that fellow that sailed away
before the mast this morning.
X.
There I was seated in a box all alone
â Miss Nancy Olden, by courtesy of the
management, come to listen to the
leading lady sing coon songs, that I
might add her to my collection of take
offs.
She's a fat leading lady, very fair
and nearly fifty, I guess. But" she's got
a rollicking, husky voice in her fat
throat that's sung the dollars down
deep Into her pockets. They say she's
planted them deeper stillâ In the foun
dations of apartment housesâ and that
now she's the richest roly-poly on the
Rlalto. -
Do you know, Maggie darlin', what
I was Baying to myself there in the
box, while I watched the stage and
waited for Obermuller? He said he'd
drop In later, perhaps.
"Nance," I said, "I kind of fancy
that apartment sort of idea myself.
They tell you, Nancy, that when
you've got the artistic temperament,
that that's all you'll ever have. But

throng are eager and Impatient 1 for the
latest one.
Popular novels, by the way, are sel
dom ever gotten out in cheap editions.
They reaiy? are hot worth while. The
standard*'' price is one dollar and a half,
but tbÂ»*t nay be lowered to one dollar
afvf //.'ffht cents if the dealer so pleases.
HJ.'ir-ver. he cannot sell it at a lower
nguFte'.the first year of Its publication.
After that . he may do as he pleases,
but as a general thing the ealo has so
greatly diminished that he turns his
attention to a better paying invest
ment.
This is not so with the standard books.
The demand- is so great and competi
tion is so keen that they may be pur
chased at almost any price. Shakes
peare stands first and next to it comes
Dickens and either of these works may
be had for the immense, sum of ten
cents. At this rate there is really no
reason why every library In town
should not comprise a complete set.
Ten cents, of course, means an ordi
nary paper cover, twenty-five cents a
cloth cover and bo on until the sum
of one hundred dollars may be paid
for a handsomely embossed leather set
that reads for* the world and all like
the cheaper one.
Just at present Horace Fletcher has
been giving the literary world some
clever work on The New Thought.
Really one would be surprised at the
number of books that are sold and the
number of magazines as well that are
published on this subject. The fluffy
summer girl, who looks as though she
might want a pretty light story, goes
her way with a volumne of reasoning
and lessons -with her and the plainly
dressed little woman tucks the latest
novel under her arm and walks out in
a guilty, fashion, Â«o you see one can
never Judge by appearances.
Any toplo that is brought forcibly be
fore the people always creates some
what of an impression upon deep think
ers. And this has been especially true
of the Eastern question. People dis
covered how very little they really
knew about Russia and Japan and
thought by delving into their past his
tory to better understand the problem.
But the average man cares very little
for such perplexing questions, and the
womenâ never. They do not want to be
troubled with the solid, heavy reading
matter of the nations and are perfectly
happy with the light fiction of the day.
Considering life's trials and tribula
tions this is not to be wondered at.
These popular stories, especially of the
Colonial type, seemed to be the one
thing needed with a hammock and a
ehady nook. Their plots are interesting
though rarely heavy, their conversation
is light and breezy, and all told they
assist one to pass a thoroughly agree
able and frequently profitable after
noon.
Musio and the opera should not be
omitted from the list of books that are
purchased by literary lovers, for this,
in itself has made San Francisco fam
ous among the publishers. All the
year round there is a splendid sale in
this line of material, and it Is difficult
to keep. enough volumes on hand during
the grand opera season and throughout
the fall and winter. Those who love
the music for its own sake want to ap
preciate the play for its literary worth,
and, as a rule,"*ne will find that nearly
every man, woman and child is . thor
oughly acquainted with all the operas
from A to Z and there are few cities in
the Union, let me tell you, that Â«*-Â«n
boast of such a record^
{Â¦"T^HESE days there are very few
1 books that win their way entirely
1 through their own merit, for the
X publishers have discovered that
advertising and plenty of it pays, and
pays welL Occasionally a book comes
out in a plain, unassuming color and in
a plain unassuming way, and the
striking individuality stands out
stronger than all the advertising that
can be done. For instance, what could
have had a greater sale than "David
Harum" or "Mrs-Wlggs of the Cabbage
Patch V Both ran into the hundreds of
thousands and are good sellers even
at this late day, and that Is something
to say of a book that Is considered light
fiction.
And the books, by the way, that are
the most popular and that sell the best
are light, summer reading; something
that is frothy, something that is airy
and that requires no deep thinking.
Of course there are people who read
books that are really worth while, but
the average person is the one who asks
for a pretty, winsome tale like "When
Knighthood Was in Flower." They
want to be amused for the minute in
a way which will leave no unpleasant
memories. In fact, the demand is for
stories that leave a pleasant impres
sion, rather than the old-time tragedy.
The three books that are the most
popular this year are "The Crossing,"
"In the Bishop's Carriage" and "Mem
oirs of a Baby." The first named
sprang into instant popularity, and
there are few books that can boast of
a better record. In the six weeks that
it has been out we have sold over one
hundred thousand copies and the good
work is still being kept up, so that it
is easy to prophesy that it will run
Into edition after edition.
Now and then a clever bit of work
is passed lightly over and is soon rele
gated to the back shelf. The publio
are as fickle as thistledown, blowing
here one day and there another, and it
is sincerely to be hoped they will veer
in the direction of "When Wilderness
Was King," by Randall Parrish. This
book is very good and entirely out of
the ordinary, but whether it will be a
success remains to be told.
In speaking of the popularity of
books, one thing should bo duly con
sidered. It is one thing to rush to the
library and take a book out on your
membership card and another to walk
into a shop and pay one dollar and a
half for iL Money speaks louder than
words, and it Is this which constitutes
a dealer's idea of popularity. A story
that may be all the talk on the streets
may not be a paying proposition in the
shops.
The publio has always had fads and
probably always will have, and this
holds good in the literary world as well
as In any other. A few years ago
everything ran to the colonial vein and
nothing, was considered quite up to
snuff that did not at least Busiest the
powdered hair and the - silks and the
satins of picturesque colonial days. Yet
this fad has died out to a great decree.
People are tired of it. They want a
change and when they are â¢ willing . to
pay for it, they 'certainly are entitled
to It. Good books of adventure are
what the public demand these days.
Witty, bright tales of children are tak
ing more or less and they are a splen
did class of books, for they never fall
to be sweet and wholesome.
Society leaders have much to do with
the popularity of books in their own
little clique. At an afternoon feather
ing Mrs. So and So turns the conver
sation upon such and such a book and
those who are in Ignorance consider
themselves entirely out in the cold and
straightway go to a store and purchase
it in order to post themselves. They
want to read something, but really do
not care Just what, and as Ions; as a
book has been recommended it will do
quite as well as anything else. And
this is true of. the average person.
When a book is dramatized it always
leaps into publlo favor, even if it had
been on the ragged edge before. For
Instance, when "Ben Hur" came to
town every one was enthuslastlo about
the play and as a consequence we sold
considerably over two thousand copies
of the book. The same was true of
"If I Were a KingÂ»" and even as short
a time ago as when "The Little Min
ister" was here we ran out of copies
of every size and description and sim
ply could not get them in fast enough
for a few days. So when a book is
staged its sale is helped a great deal.
Books, by the way, are not like they
used to be when Dickens, Scott and
Thackeray were in their, heyday. These
authors, of course, remain the stand
ards and there is never a time when
they are not more or less in demand,
but the popular novel of to-day is en
tirely different. In the first place it
is written to sell and when it has run
through a number of editions nothing
more is demanded of It. The, book that
sells over a hundred thousand copies
this year is but little talked of next,
and the following year is entirely for
gotten, for the same author has placed
a newer and perhaps a better book
upon the market and the admiring:

POPULAR READING OF THE DAY
side to the shadows and he holds his
big black head to the light of the set
ting sun and curses and challenges
everything In Eight. That is the pic
ture the author's words have conjured
up before our imagination, and that is
the dramatic moment the artist's pen
cil has chosen to depict, t w.
One day the lordly bull, bellowins an
grily across his range, saw two hunt
ers coming down the river in a boat.
He remembers well the look and Bmell
of that breed of creatures; It was
men who murdered his mother: their
guns had first taught him the scent
of blood and made him the alien of the
wild. He rushes to the river brink and
bellows out a challenge. A rifle rises
to a hunter's shoulder. Is this \ the end
of the author's art? Not yet. l
Let him alone, says the other hunter.
They did not want bull meat. Down
the stream they paddled and the bull
followed bellowing at Intervals and be
tween times panting with pent-up rage.
He was at enmity with all the world.
Hating every creature of- the wilderness
who held aloof from him as an alien:
mad with men because they had mur
dered his mother; mad with the female
moose because she had the uxfklnd folly
to refuse him; mad with the wilder
ness for sending nothing out of its
depths fit to fight him; feeling strong
and mad enough to rip up the bowels of
mighty mother earth herself; so he fol
lowed the boat.
But In his pursuit of the boat ha
chanced to come upon a feeding herd
of cattle, and felt the call of hla kind
and, content and at peace in their com
pany after his cheerless years so
empty of love and companionship, for
sook his grim pursuit, and was adjust-
forth to the light of day. The wild deni
zens of the forest were superstitious
about the bell the mother wore, and the
rattle of it drove them off In panic
dread whenever they disturbed her
browsing. So the bull calf had time to
come to the strength of bullhood.
The first tragedy of his life was when
the Indians shot his mother, and shud
dering at the smell of blood he hid
away in the thickets. Long after he
would bellow out his pain and loss and
loneliness, and call to her in vain for
that dear companionship which was
nevermore to be the possession of the
"Alien of the Wild." As his strength
grew and the stroke of isolation smote
him day by day, the thing became
what to humans is the iron entering
into the soul. Now, his plaintive bel
lowings gradually turned to bitter tone,
untamable buck In all the woods, be
comes â¢ illing captive, and all for ten
der lcrve of that little white-bodied
sheep. The tale is none the less human
because an animal story. The man
who does not like that would not knowi
a story from a spigot in a stale and
empty beer keg.
The next sample is much better. It
is called the "Alien of the Wild," and
this title Is apt, attention-catching and
fitting to the body of the tale. It Is
about a bull, and there 13 a good pic
ture of a bull that goes with it, done by
the artist, Charles Livingstone Bull.
This bull is born of a cow as Bhe fled
affrighted before a forest fire which de
stroyed her home shed-shelter and pro
tected pasture forever, and sent her
wandering in the wilderness, where this
bull calf, the "Alien of the Wild," came
and later to rage. He became a two
year-old. He tackled a big black bear
Just because he was â¢ mad with other
things in general, and the bear licked
him good for his presumption and left
him neck-wounded and heart-sulky for
many weeks. Then he fought a big
full-grown moose just because he was
angry at fate, and the bull moose
thrashed him Into deeper dudgeon.
Then he sulked in the thickets for a
whole year, till his neck grew thicker
and stlffer and his horns stouter and
more dangerous and his temper more
terrible. So he emerged the next spring
a three-year-oldâ bullhood was fully
come.
But he was lonely and restless; ha
wanted something he could not find.
No lowing responded when he bellowed.
He found a female moose alone, await
ing a mate. He wooed her. Frightened
at his strangely alien look and terrible
angry head, she refused him.
Then it dawned upon his dull brute
brain that he was indeed the "alien
of the ; wilderness." He let his sullen
temper loose in rampage and browbeat
bullfully everything he could find; tore
every bear that crossed his trail: hurled
all the hell that resided in his bijr neck
into the hide of every bull moose who
ventured on his chosen ranee.
Then he picked out a high hill place
which he would go to every morning
and evening, and there, with his big
black head silhouetted against the sky
line, he would bellow forth his raere and
defiance. Translated into human words
bis bellowlngs there would have re-
Bounded as the appalling blasphemy
of a soul in rebellion against the whole
cosmic order because it was not made
to his individual liking. The dust of
his raging pawings go down the hill-

/""VHARLES G. D. ROBERTS, who
I / wrote the well-known "Kindred
\/D of the Wild," and several other
good books which tend to make
us more intimate with our kin
folk of the forest, comes again to help
us to renewed and extended acquaint
ance with these country cousins in a
collection of short stories called "The
Watchers of the Trails." Roberts is
well equipped for such a task, for
from a boy's eag-er observation up to
man's contemplation he has felt the
lure of the lairs, loved to trace the
trails, watched the haunts of the wild,
and sought under the surface of that
Which the eyes can seÂ» and the ears
hea-, for the mind and heart, the mo
tive?, hopes, terrors and happinesses
of these beasts whom Darwin has
taught us believe are but ourselves
In lower ttnges of development.
Roberts Is greatly aided in thus in
tensifying our Interest in his animal
creations by the splendidly sympa
thetic Illustrations of Charles Liv
ingston Bull. The text of the book Is
made clearer and more pleasant by the
aiding work of the artist in eo force
fully and powerfully assisting the
imagination to picture the subject
matter of the stories. No small share
of the success of the book Is due to
the work of Mr. Bull. Here we

Ing far above us humans, tolling on
earth's surface; the lordly beasts with
antlered heads, who fill the October
woods with romance by their love and
war, their restless wanderings In
search of lovemates. their love calls
and fierce battles to the death for a
disputed doe â all these are so well pic
tured tor us by the artist, Charles
Livingston Bull, that the Illustrations
help wonderfully the words of the au
thor In bringing closer homo to us the
lives of the beasts of thÂ« far-off for
est.
Aithcuth this beck would be inter
esting to all. It will be especially pleas-
Ins; to the boys. Even if wo older
folks cant care so much for the anl
xnals as the keen curiosity of youth
does, yet we all can all Join In their
enjoyment ml the stories and pictures
and we can hope that this contempla
tion will make them kinder to the
brutes. If children love to consider
the ways of the animals of the wild
let parents permit them to do so, for
It is true, as the poet sings:
He praye'.h tÂ«*t who lorcth fceÂ»t
All xt'.r.f s, both treat and small.
For the rood God who lovelh ui
Re n-.tfie and loreth all.
For after aU we are linked, more
mystically perhaps than a Darwin
could demonstrate In scientific prose,
to the lower creatures of the various
and vast creation.
There are more good stories in the
collection than we have space to de-
Ecribe, but like all good things, when
you taste of one it makes you want
another, and so we try to give aynop
tically some samples.
First, there is the story of thÂ»
"Freedom of the Black-faced Ram,"
staring out with a picture of the ram
on the top of RIngwaak Hill, guard
ing, sentinel-like, his beloved ewe and
her lamb, who lay at his feet content
with their protector. Note How that
single statement gives imaginative ma
terial foT a picture fit to frame.
This black-faced, heavily horned ram
comes froi-i a white-faced hornless
flock by a freak of nature. He is
Â¦what naturalists know by the name
of a "sport"; and before the tale is
half-way through you fizul oat that
"Watchers
of the Trails"
he !s also a sport in the dead-game
sense of the term as men use it anent
some of their own kind. He is also a
sample of what students of heredity
designate as atavism, and has -"bred
back" to some far-off ancestor who
had a black face and heavy goat-like
horns. The owner of the ram of this
story treasured him as a novelty till
he was found spoiling the uniformity
of his white fleeced fiocxc by besetting
lambs splotched with black. Then he
was eold at butcher's price. He was
rope-led by his purchaser through the
wilderness toward a far-off farm. The
ram smelt the sweet air of the wild
and the atavism of his black face and
big horns was also in his blood and
made him wish that no man had
strings upon him, no fence might con
fine him, no herder hold him 'from his
will to wander. Midway aforest, the
man athlrst. bent over to imbibe from
a bubbling spring. Oh, opportunity
golden great! thought the rope-led
captive to himself.
The situation as his ramshlp saw it
was that this bent-over man with his
back turned temptation-wise was the
alcme gate betwixt him and perfect
freedom. He butted that gateway
down, and the then wide-open wilder
ness welcomed the atavist as he rushed
rejoicing into Its depths. The man
dropped instantly, and it was several
seconds later before his slower moving
brain tumbled to the situation that
his goat-headed ram was gone where
the woodbine twineth.
This tale ends comparatively tamely,
but it passes from butting to beloving,
from the angry to the tender passion,
and withal is full of pathos and ram
romance to the very last. In the wild
erness of his new-found freedom he
finds also a ewe who has wandered
far from the fold. He becomes her
lover and cherishes her little lamb
with all a foster-father's fondness.
Now for the finale comes Fate to play
one of her most fantastic tricks.
Through the wilderness happens to
pass the man; he picks up the helpless
little lamb, while the dam follows
bleating plaintively. The lover is led
captive by this chain of events; the
unseen rope holds like a hawser and
the wildest, the most daring "dead
game sport," the most untamed and

RATHER an amusing reason Is
given by Anna B. Doughten as
to why young girls' wages still
/remain so much lower than
young men's, when the same

"does a girl work with any Idea of
permanency, and often me brighter
and more capable she Is, the sooner
does some young man find that her
qualifications are Just what he wants
In a wife. Indeed, it tea fact," says
this philosopher, "that many employers
have found It useless to train good
looking, capable girls in any special
lines, for Just when they are fitted for
the required duties and the accom- â¢

with him. "They say the Prince of
Wales always gets the straight tip, and
I'll be sure to be put on to something
good."
And he was. Captain Lushton told
him that his mare Nettie was sure to
win the Rangoon Plate, forgetting to
mention that he himself had backed
Tomboy for the same race.
"Must have wrenched a leg." Lush
ton assured Larry, when Nettle came
In absolutely last, but as the secretary
wrote "I. O. U." for all the bets he
made, and as Sir Lemuel would be into
his own again before settling day and
would have to pay up. it did not really
matter to the captain.
The regiment was so pleased with Sir
Lemuel's contributions that the best
they had in their marquee waa none
too good for him. The ladies found
him an equally ready mark. Mrs. Ley
burn was pretty and had fish to fry.
"I must do a little missionary work
That's why Sir Lemuel tarried for a
day on the Newcastle Maid. Nobody
would go near him but the chief engi
neer, who handed him meat and drink
through a porthole, and laughed sooth
ingly at his fancy tales.
After chota hazrl next morning the
secretary brought Captain Larry a
large basket of official papers for his
perusal and signature. That was Sir
Lemuel's time for work. His motto
was business first, and afterward, more
business. Each paper was carefully
contained in a cardboard holder se
cured by red tape.
"The log, eh, mate?" said Larry when
the secretary brought them into his
room. "It looks ship-shape, too."
"This file, sir, is the case of Deputy
Commissioner Grant, first grade, of
Bungaloo. He has memorialized the
Government that Coatsworth, second
grade, has been appointed over his
head to the commlssionershlp of
Bhang. He's senior to Coatsworth, you
know, sir, in the service."
"Well, why has Coatsworth. been
made first mate then?"
"Grant's afraid It's because he of
fended you, sir, when you went to
Bungaloo. He received you in a Jah
â¢ ran* coat, you remember, and you were
awfully angry about it."
"Oh, I was, was I? Just shows what
an ass Sir Lemuel can be sometimes.
Make Grant a commissioner at once
and I'll sign the papers."
"But there's no commisslonership
open, sir, unless you set back Coats
worth."
"Well, I'll set him back. I'll di - a
charge him from the service. What
else have you got there? What's that
bundle on the deck?"
"They're native petitions, sir."
Larry took up one. It began with an
oriental profusion of gracious titles be
stowed upon the commissioner, and
went Into business by stating that the
writer, Baboo Sen's wife, nad got two
children by "the grace or God and the
kind favor of Sir Lemuel the father
of all Burmans." And the long peti
tion was -all to the end that Baboo Sen
might have a month's leave of ab
sence.
Larry chuckled, for he did not under
stand the complex nature of a Baboo's
English. The next petition gave him
much food for thought; It made his
head ache. The English was like lo
garithms. "Here," he said to the sec
retary, "you fix these petitions up later,
I'm not used to them."
He straightened out the rest of the
"Why, making speeches and driving

ing aboard ship in a jlggledy sampan

put all along the front there, so that
ships won't have to load at their moor
ings. Just put me in mind of that to
morrow." '.V'-;\\7 'Y^
Next day there was considerable di
version on the Newcastle" Maid. "The
old man's got the D. T.'s," the chief
engineer told the first officer. "I locked
him in his cabin last night when they
brought him off, and he's banging
things around there in great shape.
Swears he's the ruler of Burmah and
Sir Glmmel Somebody. I won't let him
out till he gets all right again, for he'd
go up to the agents 'with this cock-and
bull story. They'd cable home to the
owners, and he'd be taken out of the
his late loss, as we all know how deeply
he feels it."
"Gad! but he's rubbing it in," said
Lushton.
"I repeat, we are glad to have him
among us once again. My secretary
assures me that there's not a single
dacolt left alive in the province.
There's nothing like putting these re
bellious chaps down. I had a mutiny
myself once, on board the Kangaroo.
I shot the ringleaders and made every
mother's son of the rest of them walk
the plank. So I'm proud of the good
work the Judicial has done in this re
spect."
Now, it had been a source of irritat
ing regret to every deputy commis
sioner In the service that when he had
caught a dacoit red handed, convicted
and sentenced him to be hanged, and
sent the ruling up to the Judicial fo/
confirmation, he had been , promptly
sat on officially, and the prisoner either
pardoned or let off with a light sen
tence. Consequently these little pleas
antries of the captain were looked upon
as satire. .
The secretary sighed as he shoved in
his pocket the written speech, which
the captain had allowed to slip to the
floor. "It'll do for another time, I sup
pose," he said wearily; "when he gets
over this Infernal touch of sun or Bur
mah head."
The other speeches did not appeal to
Captain Larry much, nor, for the mat
ter of that, to the others either. He
had certainly made the hit of the even
ing.
"It's great, this," he said bucollcally
to the secretary, as they drove home.
"What, sir?"
"Shall we have j the honor of your
presence at the races to-morrow?"
pleasantly asked a small, withy man
four seats down the table.
. The captain . was caught unawares,
and blurted out, "Where are they?"
"On the racecourse, sir."
The answer was a simple, straight
forward one, but nevertheless it made
everybody laugh.
"I thought they were on the moon,"
said the captain in a nettled tone.
A man doesn't laugh at a Chief Com
missioner's joke, as a rule, because it's
funny,' but the mirth that followed this
was genuine enough.
"Sir Lemueris coming out," said
Captain Lush ton. "Pity the Ironclad
wouldn't go away every week."
In ; the natural order of things Sir
Lemuel had to respond to the toast of
"The Queen." Now, the secretary had
very carefully and elaborately prepared
the Chief " Commissioner's speech for
this occasion; Sir Lemuel had con
scientiously "mugged" it up, and if he
had not at that moment been a prisoner
on board the Newcastle Maid would
have delivered it with a pompous sin
cerity which would have added to his
laurels as a deep thinker and brilliant
speaker. But the captain of a tramp
steamer, with a mixed cargo of sherry,
hock and dry monopole in his stomach,
is not exactly the proper person to de- v
liver a statistical, semi-official after
dinner speech. v
When " the captain arose to 'his feet
the . secretary whispered In his ear,
"For heaven's sake don't say anything
about the judicial's wife. Talk about
dacoits"; but the speech, so beautifully
written, s"o lucid in its meaning and so
complicated in its detail, became a
waving sea of foam. From out the
billowy waste of this indefinite mass
there loomed only the tall figure of the
cadaverous J. C; and attached to it,
as a tangible something, the fact that
he had lost his wife and settled the
dacolts.
It was glorious, this getting up before
two strings of more or. less bald-headed
officials to tell them bow the state
ought to be runâ the ship steered, as it
were. "Gentlemen," he began, '"Starting
off bravely enough, "we are pleased to
have among us once more our fellow
skipper, the Judicial Commissioner."
"The old buck's got a rare streak of
humor on to-night," whispered Lush
ton.
"His Jovial face adds to the harmony
of the occasion. I will not allude. to
Owing to the j indisposition of the
Chief Commissioner, by special arrange

Colonel Short, sir," added the secretary,
pointing to a tall, clerical looking gen
tleman. "He's looking very much cut
up over the loss of his wife."
"Wife dead; must remember that,"
thought Larry.
Just then the Judicial Commissioner
caught sight of the captain and has
tened forward to greet him. "How do
you do, Sir Lemuel? I called this after
noon. So sorry to find that Lady Jones
was away. You must find It very lone
ly, Sir Lemuel. I understand this is
the first time you have been separated
during the many years of your mar
ried life."
"Yes, I shall miss the little woman.
That great, barracks Is not the ' same
without her sweet little face about."
"That's a pretty tall order," ejacu
lated a young officer to a friend. And
it was, considering that Lady Jones
was an Amazonian type of woman, five
feet ten, much given to running the
whole state, and known as the "Iron
dad." But Larry dldn!t know that, and
had to say something. ',' ! , "Â»

few days. I want her to enjoy herself
while she's away. You will feel the loss
of your wife, Mr. Barnes, even more
than I; for, of course, she will never
come back to you."
1 To say that general consternation
followed this venture of the captain's
is drawing it very mild indeed, for the
J. C.'s wife was not dead at all, but
had wandered far away with a lieuten
ant in a Madras regiment.
"It's the Ironclad put him up to that.
She was always down on the J. C. for
marrying a girl half, his age," said an
assistant \ deputy commissioner to a 1
man -. standing beside him. , v "
The secretary was. tugging energeti

realizing the tug.
"Dinner is on, sir."

fyill LEMUEL JONES. C. I. E.,
VOv was Chief Commissioner of Bur-
Y) man. Lawrence Jones, captain
X^~ of the tramp steamer Newcastle
Maid, was his brother. More than that,"
they were twins, as like as two drops of
water. It was kismet that Sir Lemuel
should rise to be Chief Commissioner,
while it Larry's own fault that he
was only captain of a freighter. But
they both enjoyed themselves, each
after his kind.
One morning in November the New
castle Maid glided up the Irawadl and
swung to moorings just off the main
wharf at Rangoon. Larry had not seen
his brother for years, and for the mat
ter of that did not care if many more
years passed before he saw him. Their
paths ran at right angles. He was
there for a cargo of rice, not to renew
family ties.
It was because the chief engineer of
the Newcastle Maid was a man after
his own heart that he said before going
ashore: M I don't want to get into a
pale her?-, for I've had - letter from^
the owners over that last break I made'
in Calcutta; if I come off seas over
just luck me in the cabin and don't let
me out. No matter what I say, keep
me there until I'm braced up."
'flu n the captain vent ashore.
He took a drive out through the can
tonnwnts, As he bowled along In .he
>!d gharry a new experience came to
him. Gentlemen lifted their hats, and
ladies driving in their carriages smiled
and bowed in the most gracious man
ner.
"I wonder if there's anything stick
ing to mj- face." thought Larry, and he
1'a.ssed his hand carefully over its
rounded surface; it seemed all right.
But still they kept it up â everybody
he met. and one officer, galloping by on
his pony, took a pull at the animal's
head and shouted, "Are you coming to
the club to-night, sir?"
"No!" roared the captain; for he
hadn't the faintest idea of going to a
club without an invitation.
"They'll be awfully disappointed,"
came the echo of the officer's voice as
the gharry opened up a gap between
them.
"Very kind." muttered Larry; "but
I fancy they'll get over it. Must have
taken ice for somebody else."
The next minute Larry was busy
staring open-mouthed at the image of
himself sitting in a carriage Just in
front. The carriage was turning out
of a compound and blocked the road,
no that his own driver was forced to
stop. He recognized the other man.
It was Sir Lemuel, his twin brother.
The recognition was mutual. The
Commissioner bowed quite coldly as
the captain called out, "How are you,
Lemuel?"
Then the big Waler horses whipped
the carriage down the road at a slash-
Ing gait, and Larry was left alone.
"So that's why they've been taking
off their hats to me," he mused. "They
take me for Sir Lemuel. Great time
he must have ruling these yellow nig
gers out here. I'd like to be In his
shoes Just for a day. to see how it feels
to be King of Burmah."
All the way back to the hotel he was
thinking about it Arrived there, he
wrote a note addressed to the chief
commissioner and sent It off by a na
tive. "That will bring him." he mut
tered; "he always was a bit afraid of
me."
It was six o'clock when Sir Lemuel
arrived in his carriage. There was a
great scurrying about of servants and
no end of salaaming the "Lat Sahib";
for it was not often the chief commlsl
eioner honored the hotel with his pres
ence. He was shown to Captain Jones'
room.
"Take a seat, Lem," said Captain
Larry, cheerfully. "I wanted to see
you and thought you'd rather come
here than receive me at Government
House."
''P'ease be brief, then." said Sir Lem
uel, in his most dignified manner; "I
have to attend a dinner at the club to
night In honor of the return of our
Judicial commissioner." â¢
"Oh. Sir Lemuel will be there in
time for that." chuckled the captain.
"But first. Lem. for the sake of old
times. I want you to drink a glass of
wine with me. Tou know we took a
drink together pretty often the first
year of our existence." Then he
broke out into a loud sailor laugh
that irritated the Commissioner.
"While I can't approve of drinking
to the extent you have carried it," said
Sir Lemuel, with Judicial severity,
"still I can't refuse a *lass proffered
by my brother."
"Your twin brpther," broke in
Larry, "of whom you've always been
so fond, you know."
"I really must be going, so please
tell me why you've sent for me." But
when he had drunk the glass of wine
he gave up all idea of going any
where â for it was drugged.
Then Captain Larry 'stripped his
brother, peeled the august body of
the commissioner as one would strip
a willow, And draped him in his own
sailor outfit. "You're a groggy-look
ing captain," he said, as he tried to
brace t&e Â£gor*,V9 la a bis chair*
"you're a discra.ce to tne service;
you'll have your papers taken away,
the first thing you know."
When he had arrayed himself In the
purple and line linen of the coinmis-
Bioner he emptied the contents of the
bottle of wine through the window.
Then he went below and s^oke to the
proprietor. "The captain upstairs,
who had an important communication
to make to me, has become suddenly
most completely intoxicated. Never
saw a man get drunk so quickly in my
life. Can you have him sent off to
his ship, so that he won't get in dis
grace? It's my express wish that this
should be done, as he has been of
service to me."
"All right, sir." exclaimed the ho
tel-keeper, touching his . forehead
with his forefinger in salute, "I will
g*:t Ca:>tain Davin. who is a great
friend of his. to take him off right
away."
"Most considerate man, the Chief
Commisioner," remarked the boniface,
as the carriage rolled away.
The carriage swung in under a shed
like portico at the front of a big strag
gling bungalow. The driver pulled up
his horses; the two yaktail-bearlng
footmen, who had jumped down from
their places behind as the carriage
turned in off the road, ran hastily up,
opening the door and lowering the
steps for The Presence, the Lat Sahib,
the Father of all Burmans.
"Hallo! there's the ship's log," ex
claimed the captain, looking at the big
visitors' book in the entrance. "Wonder
where I've got to sign that? The ship
musters a big crew," as he ran his eyes
down the long list of names.
"When does The Presence want the
carriage?" asked a ponderous, much
liveried native servant, making a deep
salaam.
The captain pulled out his watchâ Sir
Lemuel's watch. "It's a beauty," he
mused, as his eyes fell on its rich yel
low Hides. "Right away, mate â I mean
bos'n â that is, tell him not to go away.
"Wonder 'what that fellow's proper title
is on the muster?"
"Ah, you're to dine at the club to
night. Sir Lemuel," a cheery English
voice said, as a young man came out of
a room on the right.
"I know that," angrily answered
Larry. "I don't have to be told my
business."
"Certainly, Sir Lemuel; but you asked
me to Jog your memory, as you are apt
to forget these things, you know."
"Quite right, quite right," answered
the captain. "If you catch me forget
ting anything else, just hold out a sig
nalâthat is, tip me the wink, will you?"
"We've had a telegram from Lady
Jones, Sir Lemuel "
The cold perspiration stood out on the
captain's forehead. This was something
he had forgotten all about. A bachelor
himself, it had never occurred to him
that Sir Lemuel was probably married
and that he would have to face the
wife.
"Where Is she? When Is she coming
back?" he gasped.
"Oh, Sir Lemuel. It was only to say
that she had arrived safely in Prome."
"Thank God for that!" exclaimed the
captain, with a rare burst of reverence.
The private secretary looked rather
astonished. Sir Lemuel had always
been a very devoted husband, but not
the sort of a man to give way to an ex
pression of strong feeling simply be
cause his wife had arrived at the end
of her Journey.
"Do you happen to remember what
she said about coming back?" he asked
of the wondering secretary. .. -
"No, Sir Lemuel; but she'll probably
remain till her sister Is out of danger
â a couple of weeks, perhaps."
/ "Of course, of course," said the cap
tain. "Thank the Lord! I mean I'm so
glad that she's had a safe voyage," he
corrected himself, heaving a great sigh
of relief. "That's one rock out of the
channel," he muttered.
A bearer was waiting patiently for
him to go and change his dress. The
captain whistled softly to himself when
he saw the dress. suit all laid out and
everything in perfect order for a "quick
change." as he called It. As he finished
dressing, the "bos'n," he of the goir
eous . livery, appeared, announcing,
"Johnson Sahib, sir." ,
"Who?" queried Captain Larry.
"Sec'tary Sahib, sir."
"Oh, that's my private secretary," he
thought.
"I've brought the speech. Sir Lem
uel," said the young man, as he en
tered. "You'll hardly have time to go
through it before we start."'",;/;
"Look here, Johnson," he said, "I
think fever or. something's working on
me. I can't remember men's faces, and
get their names all mixed up. I
wouldn't go to this dinner to-night if
I hadn't promised to. I ought to stay
aboard the ship â I mean I ought to say
at home. Now I want you to help me
through, and if it goes off all right I'll
double your salary next month. Safe
to promise that," he muttered to him-
Belf. "Let Lem attend to .it."
At the club, as the captain entered,
the band struck . up "God Save the
Queer."
"B7 Jingo. we'rÂ« late!" he said; "the
show is over."
"He has got fever or sun, sure,"
thought his companion. "Oh, no. Sir

For the past nine years "The Roost"

be -mentioned the Athenian Club and
the Reliance Athletic Club of Oakfand
and the Metropolitan Club in Wash
ington.
About 2.". years ago he married MIes
Corinne Nicholson, the daughter of a
pioneer citizen of Oakland, and their
home life has been since passed, with
the exception of the time during the
last five years spent at the Arlington
Hotel in Washington, in the homelike
residence on Harrison street, Oakland,
where they lirst began housekeeping.
Apropos of his charming wife, the Sec
retary is fond of telling how at lunch
eon or.o day with five public men, three
of them lleprcsentatives from New
York, it was found that of the party
cf six four had married California
girls?, the Indies in question having been
the Misses Crocker, Mips Childs of Los
Angelas and Miss Nicholon.
Mrs. Metcalf is a woman of most win
ning Â¦".ays and magnetic presence, and
well fitted for the greater duties which
will now devolve upon her as a hostess
of the Cabinet circle. She has spent
the pant five winters in Washington
and has made many friends there.
Among other accomplishments she is
exceedingly clever in photography, a
work which she thoroughly enjoys, and
to whi^h she devotes much of her spare
time, being especially good in artistic
composition and finish. The one great
grief which has entered the pleasant
home in Oakland was the passing
away four years since of the daughter
of the house, Corinne, at the age of 11
years. The little girl was taken ill
while her parents were in the East.
The Secretary-elect enjoys the books
and pictures and thoroughly homelike
atmosphere which surrounds him at

smoking-room at home, perhaps bet

the bar in both Connecticut and New

two years in Utlca he came to Califor

Utica charmed with the Golden State,
and his health at that time not being
of the most robust he again came to
California in 1SSO, and in the following
year located in Oakland, forming a
law partnership with George D. Met
ralf, also a Yale man, but no relative.
His career as a lawyer, in which he has
reprc-Hinted many important interests,
has probably but served to sharpen and
develop his executive ability. He re
organized what is now known as the
Central Bank of Oakland and is now a
director in the First National Bank

SECRETARY of Commerce and
Labor in the Cabinet of the
President of the United States
is the honorable advancement
recently accepted by the Hon. Victor
Howard Metcalf, Representative from
the Third District of the State of Cali
fornia since his entry to the House in
the Fifty-sixth Congress. He is the
second man from his district and Cali
fornia to be honored with a Cabinet
position and the State, which has not
farad well hitherto in Cabinet repre
sentation. Is gratified.
"I'll get out of this in the morning,"
he said as he turned into bed. "I've
had enough of it. I'll scuttle the ship
and clear out."
This virtuous Intention would have
been easy of accomplishment, compara
tively, if he had not slept until 10
o'clock. When he arose the secretary
came to him with a troubled face.
"There's a telegram from Lady Jones,
Sir Lemuel, asking for the carriage to
meet her at the station, and I've sent
it. She's chartered a special train and
we expect her any moment."
"Great Scottl I'm lost!" moaned the
captain. "I must get out of this. Help
me dress quickly, that's a good fel
low."
An official accosted him as he came
out of his room. "I want to see you.
Sir Lemuel." \
"Is that your tom-tom at the door?"
answered tha captain quite Irrele
vantly. '^'V
"Yes, Sir Lemuel."
"Well, Just wait here for a few min
utes. I've got to meet Lady Jones and
I'm late." "
Jumping into the cart he drove off at
a furious clip. Fate, in the shape of
the Ironclad,, swooped down upon him
at the very gate. He met Lady Jones
while the Ironclad's away, she
thought. Her mission was to install
her husband in the position of port
oncer. Th^t came out laterâ came out
at the ball that night. The captain as
sured her that he -would attend.
The captain danced the opening qua
drille at the ball with the wife of the
Financial Commissioner, and. bar a lit
tle enthusiastic rolling engendered of
nis sea lire, ar.d a couple of torn trails
as they swept a little too close, he man
seed it pretty well. The secretary had
piloted him that far. Then Mrs. Ley
burn swooped down upon him.
There is an adornment indigenous to
every ballroom in the East, known as
the kaJa jagah; it may be a conserva
tory or a bay-window. A quiet Beat
among the crotons, with the drowsy
drone of the waltz flitting in and out
among the leaves, is Just the place to
work a man.
Among the crotons the missionary-ln
the-fleld was saying: "I'm sure Jack
ordered the launch to meet you at the
steamer that time. Sir Lemuel. He
knows you were frightfully angry
about it, and has felt It terribly. He's
simply afraid to ask you for the billet
of port officer; and that horrible man
who is acting officer now will get it,
end poor Jack won't be able to send me
up to Darjeeling next hot weather.
And you'll be going for a month again
next season. Sir Lemuel, won't you?"
Xyw, as it happened, the captain had
had a row with the acting port officer
coming up the river; so it was Just In
his mitt, as he expressed it. "I'll ar
range it for Jack to-morrow," he said;
"never fear, little woman."
A lady approaching from the ball
room heard a little rustle among the
plants, pushed . eagerly forward and
stood before them. Another missionary
had entered t!.e field. "I beg pardon,
Sir Lemuel," and ehe disappeared.
"Perfectly scandalous!" she said, as
she met Lushton. "Some one ought to
advise dear Lady Jones of that design
ing creature's behavior."
"For Cupid's sake, don't," ejaculated
Lushton, fervently. "Let the old boy
have his fling. He doesn't get out
often."
"I've no intention of doing so my
self," said his companion with asperity.
But all the same a telegram went
that night to Lady Jones at Prome
which bore good fruit next day, and
much of it.
The captain slipped away early from
the ball; it seemed, somehow, as though
the fun had gone out of the thing.
KING FOR A DAY
face to face. .
"Stop!" she cried excitedly. "Where
are you going, Sir Lemuel?"
' "I'm not Sir Lemuel!" roared hack
the disappointed captain.
"Nice exhibition you're making of
yourselfâ Chief Commissioner of Bur
mah!"
"I'm not the Commissioner of Bur
mahoii'm not your Sir Lemuel," he
answered, anxious to get av/ay at any
cost.
"The man is mad. The next thing
you'll deny. that I'm your wife."
"Neither are you!" roared the en
raged captain, and away he sped.
Lady Jones followed. It was a.pro
cession, the red spokes of the tom-tom
twinkling in and out the bright patches
of sunlight as it whirled along between
the big banian, trees, and behind tha
carriage, Lady Jones sitting bolt up
right with set lips. The captain reached
the wharf first. HÂ« was down .the
steps and into. a sampan like a shot.
It was the only sampan there. Tha
carriage dashed up at that Instant.
There was' no other, , boat; there was
nothing for it but to wait ;
"Come, Lem, get Into these duds and
clear out!" cried the captain, as he
burst into his cabin.
".You. villain! I'll have you sent to
the Andamans for this," exclaimed the
prisoner?
(Continued from Pnge 6.)
"Quick! Your wife** waiting on
the dock," said Larry.
That had the desired effect; Sir Lem
uel became as a child that had played
truant.
- "What have you. done, Larry T" he
cried, 'pathetically. You've ruined me."
"No, I've done you good. And I've
left you some decent wine at the house.
Get ashore before she comes off.",
"There's no help for It," said Sir Lem
uel. "There are your orders to proceed
to Calcutta to load; your beastly chief
engineer Insisted on shoving them In
to me."
"Don't *my love* me!" said the- Iron
clad, when Sir Lemuel climbed peni
tently Into the carriage. "An nour ago
you denied that I was your -wife."
' And so thev drove off, the syce tak
ing the tom-tom back to- Its owner. It
took Sir Lemuel days and days to
straighten out the empire after the
rule of the man who had been "King
for a Day."

AT HOME.
7no_textno_textrises before me. Jack had for years
* (rented a little, rickety, \ three-roomed
house from an indulgent landlord. 'He
was . shiftless and depended . upon' the
-jwashing of his patient wife, Tinnie, to
pay his rent; but still Jack evolved a
human longing and dared to express 1L
This great ambition was to be the own
er of the little house he rented. "You
know, boss," he would say, "I planted
them yaller roses what grows in the
yard and all them vines on the porch,
an* I have lived in jes' that house so
long that I kinder feel like it b'longs to
me. It do seem now, boss, you'se got
so many houses that you jes' might sell
me this one cheap an' let my money
go fur to pay fur the house instld o'
rent."
It waa merely a Joke to Jack's audi
ence that be could never be made to
see that if his rent was t*ken as pay
ment for his home he was getting the
house in the meanwhile scot-free. Only
now the pathos of It appears to me.
j The yellow roses still flaunt their sun
'shine and their gold close by the
jthreshold of the little house; yet Jack's
lone human longing was unrealized.
But fate took, though Bhe did not give.
For Virgil, Jack's only son, who was
going to school, was brought one day,
dead and mangled, to the little door by
the yellow roses: and Jack gave up
his dream, moved out and was lost to
his old patrons among the black flot
sam and Jetsam that tossed about in
the suburbs of the town, on the tidal
waves- of house-moving.
Will a mother give herself for her
children? I see now Kate, who used

Kate! Her employers call her "lazy,"
but I wonder If any of them stop to
,'think that for the very small wages
they give her she is gradually killing

constant bending over the tub Is what
induces the consumption to which
negro women are such ready victims.

had been unconscious of all this. As I

ances, one ' by one, before me to Judge

shame at the revelations they make.

br In his usual cheerful, courtly man
ner. Not a word of complaint; only a
proud, subterfuge about "them sick
folks at Smith's Grove that want me
to come up an* doctor 'em."
A broken spirit Is more fatal than
cracked walls and draughts. Lncle
Prince's sojourn in the poorhouse was
short.
There is a wealth of Imagination now
going to waste among the black folk.
Some day one of themselves will collect
their folklore. Has any child ever had
such delightful and various kinds of
creeps as tha one who has sat in some
old "mammy's" "chimley corner and
begged for ghost and witch tales? And
the mo3t eerie ghosts were the ones
that mammy had seen herself. That
was the charm to her listeners. She
never left any room for doubt. I once
saw a loophole for unbelief in one of
Aunt Melindy's witch tales. "But how
can you know that the witches rodÂ©
you to mill in the night?" I asked,
thinking that I had at last caught Aunt
Melindy napping. "Oh. la! honey; be
cause my dress and shoes were muddy
in the morning when I put them on."
The serpent figures prominently la
the negro's folklore. There is one very
picturesque legend about â¢ the snake
that they all telL Mary, the tall,
shapely houseglrl, told it to me last.
She believed as thoroughly- in her story
as any child who tells a story to his
playmate.
"I wuz liven* with the Mansflelds
then and I wuz nussln' Freelan*," said
Mary, showing: the whites of her eyes.
"He wuz about 3 years old. I noticed
when I'd give Freelan' any bread or
anything to eat he'd allus take it In
the yard. I never thought anything
about it. though â thought it wta jes'
child ways. An* Freelan* wua allus
talkln' about his bird.
"One day John, the coachman, come
in the kitchen and says, says he:
'Mary, I'm goln* to tell you somethin*.
Mebbe you'll believe me an* mebbe you
won't. But'seein* is bellevin'. It's about
Freelan'. I seen him to-day out In the
yard behind the bushes an' he wu*
eatin' his milk an* bread with a snake/
" 'My God!' says I. 'John, what would
Mlz. Mansfiel' do If she knowed it?'
Then he went out an* slipped up on
Freelan'. And. Miss Helen, 'forÂ© God
there he sat eatin' his bread an' a biff
snake about a yard long wuz Iayin'
beside him drinkin' milk out of Free
lan's cup. It set up all on its quolls
right close to Freelan'. Well, when we
killed -that snake Freelan' cried an*
cried; an' he'd talk ev'ry day 'bout his
bird an* bes to take milk to him."
Thus the black shades accuse me.
For one, self-sacrifice speaks; for an
other and another, fidelity, gratitude,
pride of spirit; for others beauty, grace
of form and bearing, melody of voice
or warmth of imagination make their
plea.
â¢If en* points this out to KatÂ» shÂ« re
plies: "I wants my nigger* to have
good does and a' eddlcatlon."
Two of 'Kate's children- are really
beauties. Their biff, soft ; black eyes
roll about under long, silken lashes.
When they open their thick red llpa to
smile â and they will do soifor a nod â
they show shining, faultless rows of
pearls. Their skin Is a warm, reddish
brown hue that has the sheen of satin.
These two* children, if they were in
Italy, would be artists' delight. In a
Southern town they are' but hardy
wlldflowers, unnoticed by the waysideâ
merely pickaninnies.
As a hero of fidelity I recall unkempt
Uncle Ike. The son of Uncle Ike's old
master had squandered hla estates, had
sunk lower and lower, had become a
drunken sot In his native town there
was none of his kind .to befriend him;
even his relatives closed their doors to
him. And v Uncle Ike, too, felt a right
eous contempt for the outcast. With
a sad quaver in his voice he told me
one day how he had been constrained
to deal withhis young master. "I look
outen my window one day an' I seed
Marse Temp comin* agin'â drunk as^
ever. I lowed to myself that I wan't"
goln' to let him Inâ to carry on like he
allers did. So I Jes' slipped right easy
an* bolted the doo' on the inside. Marse
Temp was still a-comin'. I heard the
gate latch after him. I knowed he wuz
gitten' nearder. Then I thought, Marse
Temp is a son of ol' Marse. 01' Mars a
wuz pow'ful- good to me. an' Mars a
Temp wuz good to mÂ« when we wu
boys. I Jes' had that doo* unbolted
and opened befo* Marse Temp got to it.
I "vited him in and give him a pone of
co'n-bread an' some bacon for his din
nerâan* ha wuz hongry, too. Then I
put him to bed â not on jes' a common
bed nuther, I put him on my comp'ny
bed. Fur you see it doan' mattah wat
Marse Temp do, he is ol' Marse's son,
an' ol' Marse was pow'ful good to me."
How often do we unknowingly hu
miliate that personal pride that burns
beneath even the ragged garments of
the black folk. I now remember with
remorse an old slave whose deepest
degradation I witnessedâ must I con
fess it?â unmoved. Uncle Prince
styled himself Dr. Prince Cook. In ac
cordance with his title he always wore
an ancient silk hat and a faded Prince
Albert and carried a bundle of "yarb3"
under his arm. Uncle Prince's old
master had passed Into the other
world, but the old slave lingered year
after year, growing feebler as the
cracks in his cabin grew larger. The
neighboring white people became tired
of looking after him and dt harboring
the fear of finding him some winter
morning cold and dead in his open hut.
So they forced . upon his proud soul
what was worse than death â the poor
house. But Uncle Prince's dignit>
succumbed not to even this humilia
tion. Holding himself erect in his tall
duced by Belgian and Japanese law
yers have been long recognized by the
enlightened Siamese monarch as desir
able, but there still remains the task
of educating a legal body competent to
administer justice in accordance with
the principles of western Jurisprudence.
As matters now stand, justice in Siam
Is still administered by corrupt and op
pressive local mandarins.
by emetic pills. The pills are prepared
by the priests and administered to both
accused and accuser. The one- who re
tains them longest without vomiting is
adjudged Innocent.
Consistently with its Mongolian orl- ;
gin, the Siamese criminal code imposes
many obligations which confound the
innocent with the guilty. When . a .
crime is committed, not only the fam
ily, but even the neighbors, are held
responsible for the appearance of the
culprit. When a dead body is found, .
cords are extended, encircling a radius,
of 100 fathoms round the place where
the murder was committed. All the in
habitants contained within this inelos

The Inhabitants of Slam ? have ' often

in these depredations the Siamese
themselves have had no | part. Such
outrages are always traceable to the
Malay inhabitants, who for years have
lived by plunder. The true Siamese
scorns to steal and is too indolent to
pursue more violent forms of crimin
ality. In a country where nature . pro

BY MAYNARD SHIPLEY.
IT has been well said that the true
index to the character of a peo
ple and the degree of civilization
attained by them is to be found In
the. history of their laws. In some
cases, however, the laws themselves
may have been borrowed, without hav
ing been assimilated or even enforced.
Nothing, therefore, could be more cer
tainly misleading than to accept the
recently drafted Siamese penal code
as an index to-. the stage of civiliza
tion arrived at by that people. This
code is a pure exotic, a product of
Western civilization and bears no more
vital relation to the Siamese character
and customs than the Corpus Juris
Civilis bore to the leges barbarorum of
the Frankish empire. A true concep
don of Siamese character may be de
rived from their original criminal code,
but recently displaced, although even
that body of laws was not wholly a
Siamese product..
Bounded on the north by China, tm
the west by India and jutting far out
into the China Sea, close to the Malay
an Islands. Siam has been for cen
turies the fighting ground of three
races of men, all of whom have left
Eome impress on the laws and cus
toms of the country.
Siam has no ancient literature, no
historical monuments. Her most arch
aic document* date from the founding
cf Ayuthla, A. D. 1S51, and her legis
lation contains only voluminous di
gests of crude laws, evidently of
Chinese and Indian origin. If Siam
had a Solon, a Yao, or an Alfred, his
name and his legislation have been
Io5t to posterity.
The Siamese being a very supersti
tious people, it Is not surprising: that
the ordeal plays a very conspicuous
part in their criminal procedure. Until
within the last decade the ordeals of
rice-chewing, diving and the test of
of crimes, worthy only of the most de
praved souls. Any one convicted of
theft is immediately forsaken by his
family and friends. So scrupulous on
this point of *Â¦ honor are the Siamese
that, in the country districts, even lost'
articles . remain where | they were
dropped. Notwithstanding their con
tempt for the person guilty of theft. It
is curious to note that among the Siam
ese.this crime; was. never punished by
death, as among nearly all peoples of
whom we have any historic record.
In the matter, of punishments the
Siamese code originally surpassed in
cruelty even \ that of the Chinese. It
has been several times amendedtduring
the twenty year" past, and much | of its
cruelty has been eliminated. But the
code just displaced bears ample evi
dence of the paradoxical Siamese char
acter. - : Â¦-Â¦Â¦Â¦' .
Gentle and humane in the common
occurrences of life, having a natural
horror, of . shedding human "blood, the
Siamese become ferocious 'in their at
titude toward 'culprits condemned to
death. ; The punishment inflicted on as
sassins,'only a few years since, was
horrible '; In the Â¦ extreme. â¢ The , murder
er was. forced to lie down on his stom
ach '< and was then securely, tied, â¢ after
which' a stake wan forced Into his body
lengthwise, by "the blows pf a club; and
it 'iwastdriven ;untiT It; came out,' either
Â¦ through ' : the \ stomach , or -.through â¢ the
'shoulders ; : : the ': stake was t then * raised
and stuck in the erround.';; In most cases
the . unfortunate^ criminal died under
the operation, but. sometimes the stake
passed through the body without strik
ing a vital organ; then the victim lived
for . several' days under the most horri
ble torture.
The punishment for sacrilege, as
among all barbarian peoples, was ex
tremely horrible, and is doubtless still
Inflicted in some parts of Siam. Ac-
burning coals were still in general use
and are probably yet given by the
priests in the interior. But the ordeal
was never resorted to except in de
fault of verbal or written evidence.
Competent evidence, however, is not
an easy thing to obtain under the orig
inal Siamese code, as drunkards, beg
gars, gamblers, executioners, persons
who cannot read and virgins are dis
qualified as witnesses.
Although the Siamese still firmly be
lieve that the ordeal of fire is infallible
in distinguishing the innocent from the
guilty, it is hard to understand how
such a trial could ever result in a ver
dict of acquittal â unless by bribery. A
pit is dug two feet wide, and eight feet
long; at the two ends stakes are plant
ed at certain distances to support a
cord breast high.- He who Is to under
go the proof is 'forbidden to walk for
some days, so that his feet may .be
come . softened and more Â¦ easily receive
the Impression of the fire. On the day
appointed, - the pit is filled with burn- Â¦
ing coals and the. accused walks three
times over them; 'after this he is : con
ducted to the hall of justice, where his
feet are examined and if . no burn is
found be is discharged as innocent of
the crime charged. :
The proof by water Is not so severe,
and both the accused and the accuser
are subjected to It. Two poles, distant
from six to seven feet from each other,
are erected in the river. Having each
mounted one. of these poles, the two
champions let themselves slide to the
bottom of the river and he who re
mains the longest under water is de
clared Innocent, for the, Siamese say
.the devil torments the guilty- under
the water, which makes him come up
to the surf ace,- while the innocent, who
has nothing to dread from this enemy.
Is not in. such a hurry to come to the
surface.
Another curious ordeal' is the proof
JUSTICE AND CRIME IN SIAM
cording to the procedure in these cases,
the offender's face was forced Into a
bed of smoldering coals, and at a sig
nal from the judge, two pairs of bel
lows were set to work, setting the coals
on lire, and thus consuming the head
of the transgressor by degrees.
Criminal law and procedure are now
further advanced in Slam than, for in
stance, in Korea. All excessive cruelty
has been legally (If not practically)
abolished. The death penalty is in
flicted only for murder and such other
crimes as result in the death of a per
son. Arbitrary power over the life of
subjects has been entirely wrested
from the judges, and every death sen
tence must be sanctioned by the King
before it can be executed." Many of the
native judges, being Buddhists, are ex
tremely reluctant to pronounce sen
tence "of death, and the King himself
'often commutes a death sentence to
imprisonment for life.
The method of execution In Slam is
by . decapitation, but no further . muti
lation of the body is permitted. Exe
cutions are neither entirely public nor
entirely private. In former days the
condemned j man | used to be | dragged
through the common thoroughfares to
the ground prepared for - the â¢ execution
and there beheaded in the. presence of
the assembled At present
more humane sentiments prevail, and,
although .everything ; is . stijl : public up
to the time the -condemned person is
brought , to i the . execution i ground, the
decapitation takes place Inside a room

Following the example of Japan, a
legislative Council was created in
1895 and is now composed of ten min
isters and forty-five nominated mem
bers. This council is preparing differ
ent codes of laws, such as the Penal
Code, the Commercial Code, the Civil
Code, etc.; so far, however, only the
Penal Code and part of the Commercial
Code have been, drafted. An interna
tional court tries cases between, natives
and foreigners.
The judicial improvements Intro-
ances as genuine personalitiesâ never
once realized that they, too, were hu
man souls. They were only servants,
conveniences, black beings. Their life
of toil without recompense never struck
me as unnatural. The simple practices
of their religion were only something
to smile at. The chief events of their
lives, their sorrows- and losses, only
touched me and passed on.

1AM a Southerner.
A short time ago, if one from the
North had asked me about my at
titude toward the black people I
could have answered in this fashion:
'â¢When I look back upon my old life
in the South, amid the forms that peo
ple my dreamland, I see a cloud of
black shapes. Many of these are dear
to xriemory. I recall them as I do my
pet animals â my faithful dogr that came
Â¦when I called him, my untiring saddle
horse that bore me through the beauti
ful Southern- xcoods."
To such a question now my answer
is: "I have sinned."
I have read a little, black-bound vol
ume written by a black-skinned man.
It lifted the veil of prejudice from my
eyes. It made me think.
While I have lived amid the black
folk, I used often to speculate about
how it felt to be a negro. Occasionally
in my childish ignorance and hardneBs
I have asked some toiling servant:
"Aren't you sorry you , are black?
Shouldn't you like to be white?" And
I have wondered to see swift change
of expression play upon that thick
featured face â half pain, half Judg
ment â as the quick answer came:
"So; I never wanted to be white.
White folks will have a-lots to answer
fur."
Burghardt Du Bois has answered this

FOLKUpon a background of plain dull
gold silk there will shine forth the
most brilliant of quince blossoms, all
done in clusters, with green leaves to
temper the glare of/ the scarlet. There
are long ween stems to furnish the
necessary note of green. The design
will be small and neat and apparently
done expressly for the stock or girdle
which It is "to adorn.
There is one very attractive ieaiure
about all the Japanese work, and, in
deed, about all oriental designs. It
looks as though it were done to order.
There is no hit or. miss or haphazard
about it. There is a finish that is ex
quisitely neat to everything. And in
this reppect the American handiwork
To-day one sees the great Japanese
wistaria vines embroidered and stamp
ed upon dress materials. There are
wonderful dresses, all gay with cherry
blossoms; while the Japanese quince
and Japanese flowers of all kinds, from
tiny chrysanthemums to the gorgeous
pomegranates, are found painted and
wrought, stamped and etched, outlined
and indicated upon nine out of ten of
the summer dress materials.
The Japanese Silks and Colors.
In materials this Is just as notice
able as in colors. The Japanese Bilks
were never so fashionable, and there
are countless silks and other stuffs
that feel and look like silk and which
come from the Japanese looms to be
made Into summer and autumn
gowns for the American women to
wear.
In hats, too, this Japanese influence
is seen. The plain American sailor is
still the style and always will be. But
there is a Japanese sailor, made out
of coarse, soft, Japanese straw. It
is braided and it is rolling in the brim,
and the crown is round instead of
square. The sailor hat Is trimmed
with a scarf of soft silk, which Is tied
at the back and is finished with two
floating ends, with fringe finishing
each , of the ends.
One of the pretty summer Japan
ese hats was made of open work straw
in open work design. ' Upon the under
side of. the brim there was a desijrn In
big, coarse Japanese stitchery. The
top of the crown was worked In the
same manner,' while around the
crown there was a twist of Japanese
silk finished with a bunch of cherry
blossoms. Fetching* indeed, . these
little styles, and very attractive to the
eye of the artistic American girl.
In girdles, in stocks, in parasols. In
sashes and In the small things of
dress the tendency toward the Japan
ese is very pronounced. There are
sof t Japanese silks, which , are made
not in Roman design but very like the
Roman, with stripes and squares. The
silks are decorated in odd ways,,
which are so very oriental as to, ad
mit of no mistake. i
has taken a lesson from the oriental,
for nothing could excel the Eastern
work in absolute neatness.
A Season of Necklaces.
The oriental stones are worn a great
deal. There are topazes from Korea,
emeralds from the Caucasus, lapis la
zuli from Japan and the many odd yel
low stones which come from the East.
Great strings of pierced yellow stones
are mounted upon chains of gold and
wound around the neck of the summer
girl.
It Is decidedly a necklace season and
pearl collars are worn, in the daytime,
with neckless gowns and diamond
studded gold bands with the Dutch
necks of the afternoon toilettes.
But the woman who wants a' collar,
and who cannot obtain either a dia
mond one or a collar of pearls, can take
heart, for there Is an exceedingly pret
ty makeshift for her. She can wear a
band of velvet around her throat and
upon this band of velvet she can wear
strings of yellow stones â beads, really,
they might be called â except that they
are of irregular size and shape, and so
look much richer than strings of beads
commonly look.
The making of these necklaces is a
fine art. It requires strings and strings
of fine elastic of just the length to en
circle the throat. And after these are
strung with their burden of odd stones
the whole must be mounted upon a
clasp which is set at the back of the
neck.
These semi-precious necklaces sell
for big prices in the stores, but the wo
man of taste can gather her store and
stock of beads and make them for her
self. The key to the whole is the pre
servation of color. There should ba
more yellow than anything else and
"the faint yellow tinge should prevail
throughout the whole.
The Summer Ba tiling: Girl.
The bathing suit as part of the sum
mer wardrobe Is quite a necessity, for
it can bt 'worn in fresh water or in
brine and it is a thing for which every
woman- has use at some time during
the season.
I To- make a bathing suit for herself Is
not a difficult task for any woman, for
It is a suit which need not fit accur
ately and it is a thing which can be
sewed without great attention to the
tailor-like finish of the season.
The best materials are mohair, brll-
Uantlne and wash taffeta. Where wash
silks are worn they snould be lined
with linen or with a coarse cheap grade
of brilliantlne to keep them from set
ting too closely to the body when wet.
Many of the bathing suits are lined
for this very reason, namely, to make
them keep their shape when wet. They
would otherwise set too tightly to the
body and be very unbecoming to the
fair girl as she emerges from the
water. But the linen suit keeps its
shape, it sheds the water easily and Its
weight is hot felt by the bather.
The waists of the prettiest bathlns
suits do not button in the back, but
they do button on one side in double
breasted fashion. This makes the waist
extremely becoming and youthful and
is a great improvement upon the waist
that buttons down the front. The fast
ening at the side is covered with a wldÂ»
silk slat, which may be embroidered
with a few fancy stitches.
One of the prettiest of the new bath
ing suits was .made of cream colored
mohair. It was dotted with tiny silk
dots, which were woven in the material.
All sleeves are made very short, for
the girl bather forgets the whiteness of
her arms and goes in for the glory of
sunburn. She can make her slaevea
long if she so desire, and for this pur
pose there is a very pretty bathing suit
sleeve pattern, which Is of leg o' mut
ton tendencies. It is largest at tht
wrist, where it resembles a leg o* mut
ton in shape. It Is finished with, a
tight wrist cuff.
But the girl who Is going to bÂ» a
genuine bather wears little short
sleeves, which are only sleeve puffv
They are little, straight bands of the
goods shirred in the arm, making a
little fat, becoming puff. If desired
the puff can be finished with a shirring
of washable silk.
Lovely bathing suits are made of
fine flannel and these are the suits
that are liked by the girl who goes
out to swim, for there Is a certain
warmth about flannel, wet-or dry. Ono
of the favorite models of the all-flannel
bathing suit shows full knickers. And,
over the knickers, there is a skirt that
is just long enough to completely con
ceal them.
Then there comes the full blouaa
waist, buttoning down the front. ThÂ»
whole is trimmed with bands of colored
embroidery and a band of colored em
broidery covers the buttons. This front
panel or slat should be wide, at least
two fingers In width, so that it virtu
ally forms a handsome vest.
As for hats, there are bathing hats
galore. These are made of colored rub
ber to match the costume and they are
very smart, indeed. They come In va
rious shapes, and the oilskin cap ts a
thins that Is almost forgotten.
AH bathing suits arc made In threÂ«
pieces, waist, skirt and knickers. Tha
smartest of these, however, are all at
tached so that the bather steps Into
the knickers and finds herself also la
her skirt. The skirt and the knickers
are sewed upon the same band and
both of these are attached to the blouse
waist. There should be no such thins
as a parting of the ways, where a bath
ing suit is concerned and the on* who
makes a suit should take care that it
is waveproof as regards comlnff apart.
The neatest of the suits are finished
with a washable silk sash, which is
tied around the middle. It is knotted
on one side and the two ends hang
down to the foot of the skirt and are
finished with fringe. This natty sash
finish makes the style of the suit. Tha
sash or scarf should, like the rest of
the suit, be sewed firmly in p!acÂ», to
that It cannot slip Its moorings.
The Prettiest Bathing Salts.
to the woman with a little time for
needlework.
The suit is a two-piece suit, in
other words a shirt waist suit. The
skirt is very full and is laid in the
smallest side pleats upon the narrow
skirt band. Around the foot it
spreads out and it Is trimmed with
three wide flounces, each flounce
hemmed with a deep hem. Above the
hem there is set a band of oriental
embroidery showing blue and red and
green and yellow, all prettily blended.
But it is the waist which is the
prettiest. Cut on the shirt waist order,
it buttons in the back and the buttons
are white pearl buttons set frankly
down the back, not hidden under a
slat. They are in very brilliant pearl,
opalescent and showing deep colors.
These opalescent pearl buttons are to
be had in the shops at a small price
and they certainly dress up a waist
marvelously. More than that they are
becoming more and more fashionable
and will be used in the fall as Jacket
buttons and as buttons for the cloth
gowns which are worn In the autumn.
The front of this shirt waist was
plain with the full shirred bust. Its
fullness laid upon the plain yoke in
the old fashioned round waist style
and the whole brought down into the
band of a pointed belt.
But the pretty feature, the feature
which will appeal to the summer girl,
was the very wide round collar, which
was thrown around the shoulders.
This collar, which lays flat around
the neck, was deep enough to fall
down over the sleeves. It was the
same width all the way around and
entirely covered the yoke of the gown.
Its body material was a very fine lin
en, so fine you could see through it.
And its stitchery was all in brilliant
colors.
An Oriental Collar.
To get some Idea of the pretty ef
fects which can be obtained by this
oriental stitchery it is only necessary
to take an old piece of chiffon for a
foundation. No matter how crumpled
it may be, it can be pressed and made
to answer the purpose. Of course, a
piece of expensive sheer linen is bet
ter, but a good heavy weight of chif
fon will do.
Now take a bit of Japanese embroid
ery, copy a fan If you have no ojher
pattern, or take a picture from a book
to serve as a guide. String a needle
with brilliant turkey red silk or with
a mercerized cotton, as being less ex
pensive, and begin. The stitches must
be Ion? and effective. The idea is to
work large flowers in bright colors and
to set the contrasts together as close
ly as possible to give an oriental look.
Do not be afraid to work rapidly, and
do not study the work too closely un
til It is all completed.
A summer girl at â¢ Saratoga made
herself an oriental collar the other
day, shoulder deep and upon a basis
of white taffeta. It was not as lacy
as chiffon or linen would have been,
but it was immensely effective. It
covered up an old shirt waist and made
a' brilliant bit of color in the summer
wardrobe.
The tendency toward Japanese stuffs
is most pronounced. The fad for all
things Japanese invades the realm of
dress and is becoming more and more
pronounced.
It is altogether likely that the Jap
anese stuffs were always in existence,
but it is only lately that their beauties
became apparent to Western eyes.

And ihis is why they are so fetching.
They are made of white stuffs, delicate,
thin white lawn of the kind that will

are trimmed with lace put on in pro

lac* 1 flounces and there are groups of
tucks, each tuck edged with lace, and
there are wonderful insets of lace.
These gowns, which are' made very
much on the same model, all shu-w the

made on the shirt waist order.
At least a dozen of these gowns are
trimmed with Philippine embroidery,
vrbich is very much like Japanese
needlework- It Is in gay colors and is
employed for cuffs, for the plaits, of
thirt waists, for panels, for girdles, and
for stocks. It is also used -for whole
yakes and it is again seen in bands

in epaulette shape.
When it comes to skirt trimmings
nothing could be prettier than the man
ner in which the Filipino embroidery
is applied. It is used to head the deep
flounces and it is used also to border
flounces. It bands the skirts like an
insertion and it is used to border lace
insets. And then there is the medallion
trimming, when gaudy squares of col
ored embroidery are set in the waists
and skirts of gowns and surrounded
by a little needlework.
A Word to Smart Dressers.
If there is a summer girl who has
nit yet completed her wardrobe, let
her be guided by a word of advice. Let
her study the white dresses of the sea
son and see if she cannot improve her
wardrobe by adding a white gown or
two, made by hand and trimmed with
liand-made/tucks. There is nothing as
smart this season and nothing that
has quite the general approval of white.
Over in London, where the fashion
able English world gathers at this sea
son, they are making whole wardrobes
out of white goods. Mrs. Langtry has
scarcely a colored gown in her ward
rob*- and Mrs. Arthur Paget, who is the
London fashion, wears white almost al
ways.

though she were dressed in cloth of
gold. There is a luster about white,
an attractive finish, a certain cool and

STYLES FOR
VACATION
DAYS
11The house was painfully familiar.
There in the corner was the little set
tee among the palms, where they had
sat that rainy day. He remembered
the shadows that shifted over the pale
blue gown that she had worn, and
felt again the touch of the soft hand
in his â the hands that were like no
other hands in the world.
Old Peter's shuffling' steps had died
away and the house was still. Then
he heard her step upon the stair and
down the hall and Elizabeth stood be
fore him, unchanged, except for the
graver lines about the firm, sweet
mouth and a deeper light In the dark
eyes. Brackett grasped her hand with
an almost painful force.
"You have been quite a long while
in claiming your old friends in Warn
fleld, Mr. Brackett."
It was merely a banal greeting, but
the commonplace served to place
Brackett on the right footing.
"Most certainly; and yet I feel that
I should apologize for this Intrusion,
had I not come to make apology for
a greater one that was made In my
name."
"You allude to Mr. Stinson's call?"
she laughed lightly. "Mr. Stinson
does me the honor to consider me a
force in the political situation. I as-
Her name on the lips of this coarse
man. Out of the silence of the years
to hear it for the first time in this
manner. He had been away so Ions in
the lower part of the State that he had
quite lost sight of the changes that
must have come to her as well as to
himself. So she was a social leader
now, a club woman. He remembered
the pleasant family circle as he had
known it, and wondered if it yet re
mained unbroken. Out of the coals
sprang- the picture of the girl, Eliza
beth Heath, as he had last seen her,
that night when he had told her good
by forever. He could almost hear him
self speaking the slow, fateful, reluc
tant words. In which he had told her
that the bond between them must be
broken for reasons over which he had
no control â a half-confidence that, in
the light of present knowledge, he
knew to have been far more cruel,
more cowardly than a silence that
would have left her the poor solace of
believing him utterly unworthy.
He had scarcely thought of her
when returning to the old town. He
had made the move for political rea-
Bons, and one hotel is much like an
other to a man who had forgotten the
meaning home. Like one groping
through the dark, picking up the
tangled threads of a dropped web,
John Brackett threaded back through
the mazes of fifteen years^ â fifteen!
Brackett's tread grew less resolute
and' his feet seemed to drag Just a
little as he turned into the well re
membered square and saw the white
columns of the Heath home among
the trees. Old Peter opened the
door. A little grayer about the fringe
of wool, a little more stooped, but the
same old Peter, shuffling down the
hall ahead of him.
warm rays danced over his fast-silver
ing head, bringing out the lines of the
tired, old-young face, and accentuating
in grotesque shadow the droop of his
shoulders.
sure you I appreciate the compliment,
as the president of the Hypatia. But
as Elizabeth Heath I must beg to de
cline it."
Eraekett made a slight movement
toward her. "I beg you to consider
the man and his total ignorance as to
the enormity of what he was doing. It
was a distinct shock to me to hear
your name upon his Upn. and â "
"I understand." she replied quickly.
"Believe me. I did ' not connect you
with it In the least. In fact, when he
mentioned that you would call to dis
cuss the matter I was very certain
that you were entirely ignorant of all
knowledge of his errand here."
Brackett flushed darkly.
"I trust you will treat this incident
as If it had never been, and of courso
there need be no question of your
support in a political sense."
Here they both laughed uneasily.
"So- much so," shÂ« responded. **that
I will use every effort to further the
cause of Governor Brackett."
Brackett sprang to his feet, h!Â« dark
face aglow â "Elizabeth!"
Mlsa Heath held up a warning; hand.
"Mr, Brackett. fifteen years have come
and gone since any man has held the
right to call me by that name; we
were speaking of politics."
Brackett submitted mutely as shÂ«
led the talk around to other questions
of the day. lightly and easily, givins;
him time to find himself in the talk
of old friends and places.
"And the general, how is he? and
your mother?"
She looked at him wonderingly. *T*
it possible that with all of Mr. Btin
son's information he did not tell you
that I am living here alone with only
Aunt Jane? Father and mother died
within one month of each other ten
years ago."
Brackett turned abruptly and walked
to the window. He understood many
things now â all the loneliness and ths
beautiful truth of thl3 woman who
had lived her life so bravely. Ths sun
light in the square ivas blindingâ
perhaps that was why his eyes were
wet, as he walked swiftly down the
lens room and drew her hands into his.
"Elizabeth, there was fata in Stin
son's call, the fate that has watched
U3 both through all these years. There
were ghosts that knocked and waked
my starved heart last nisht â shosta
that would not be silenced. I was a
coward then; a coward not brave
enough to humble my pride and tell
you of the burden that lay between
us â and when death removed that
burden, it was too late. I thought, but
I am here now to> plead my case
afresh, here at your mercy. WÂ© are
older now, and there Is little youth
left us, and for God's sake don't let

Will the president of the 'Hypatia'
work for me as my promised wife?
Will she, Elizabeth?"
Old Peter shuffled down the hall
unnoticed and stood in the doorway a
brief second, then he ambled away,
mopping his eyes.
"I thought that was Massa John
Brackett. I'se certain now for suah!"
(Copyright, 1904. by Curran Richard
Greenley.)
THE real boss of the campaign
committee leaned across the
table and wagged a heavy fore
finger under Brackett's nose.
"I've cinched the finest wire that
was ever pulled, and when that wire
gets done pull!n' Bill Garret's chances
are dead and rained on, or my name's
not Jim Stinson. I've interviewed
Miss Elizabeth Heath, and she's ours."
The emphatic finger stopped " as
Brackett sprang to his feet. J
'â¢You â you interviewed Miss Heath
in my favor?"
"Yes. Why not? She's a power,
*=he is, with them fellows' wives down
in the Tenth Ward, en she's a lady
light, you bet."
Eraekett dropped limply into the
chair behind him, while Stinson
poured out the history of his call
upon Miss Heath, the president of the
"Hypatia." in a mixture of slang,
plantifully sprinkled with "sez I" and
"sez she." Stinson took much glory
to himself that he should have
thought of this clever stroke Just at
the critical point of the campaign.
Miss Heath's influence in certain quar
ters was unbounded. Down in the
Tenth V.'ard, where the tall tenements
Floom above the river, the little chil
dren of the poor watched for her com
ing, and the tired mothers told her all
their trials and troubles, all their
simple ambitions and little Joys, find
ing a ready sympathy.
Stinson had heard of Miss Heath
through that channel and it was to
those poor, tired mothers that he
looked for a controlling voice in the
vote that would go up from the Tenth
Ward. Stinson had also counted on
the lever wielded by Miss Heath as
president of the Hypatia, the woman's
club that led not only in the city, but
in the State Federation. The feder
ation's Interest once aroused and its
influence brought to bear would mean
a powerful leavening at work for his
man from onfe end of the State to the
other. All this and more he poured
into the unheeding ear of Brackett,
whose mind was engrossed with the
one thought, the intolerable shame
that this man should have appealed
to Elizabeth Heath in hi3 name. Be
yond all considerations of the Gov
ernor's office, of his political future,
his mind reeled with the intensity of
this one thought.
Stinson's last words as he stood in
the doorway recalled him:
"I told her that you would call in
a few days and discuss the matter fur
ther. She seemed right willing to take
a hand after she had chewed the rag
a. bit and I saw as how a call from
you would sorter cinch it. Women
folks has to be made up to. I reckon
you know all about that? Well, so
long, Mr. Governor," and Stinson was
gone. â¢

OUR LONG DISTANCE MARRIAGE
By S. T. Stern
I go with you on one condition."
"And that Is?" "*
"That our departure be kept a secret
from VeryL We must surprise her."
We had an uneventful trip. I remem
ber very little of it. Some time during
the second day we passed a lonely
whale. He excited my sympathy at
the time. Somehow, somewhere we
landed and took train for London. We
rushed through London in a cab and
found ourselves on another train. As
near as I can remember we spent four
months on that train, though mother
says it was nearer five hours. Late
that afternoon, she tells me, we reached
Matlock. We climbed a long, steep
hill, and found ourselves in front of a
very large and very gloomy hotel, bear-
Ing a gilt sign:
"THE MATLOCK ARMS."
The next scene will abide with me
to my dying day. A fat clerk stood
in front of us and held out a long pen.
"Is Miss Veryl Preston at home?" I
"No, sir."
"Where is she?"
"She left for America last Thursday
with the general, her father. She said
something about being married over
there and planning a surprise for her
fiance.
Yes, we were married, after all.
Veryl cabled that she was coming back
at once, after I had cabled my own
whereabouts. She insisted on being
married in. England. I insisted on New
York. We compromised on New York.
(Copyright, 1904, by S. T. Stern.)
and that we proceed by different
Bteamers to America, where the re
maining portion might be read. Veryl
would have none of it. She had cove
nanted to be married in the presence
of her parent â not half married. "And
besides, John," she added reproachful
ly, "If anything should happen to you
on the return trip, I would be a semi
widow." The lugubrious prospect of
semi-widowhood invited tears and I
desisted.
The plan of marriage by cable, next
advanced, met with like discourage
ment, as being "too much on the order
of an international chess tournament."
Wireless telegraphy offered some Blight
prospect of solution, but Veryl retreat
ed on account of its uncertainty.
With the rattle of the first milk wa
gon on the street outside, and Its re
minder that morning had arrived, came
the scheme that we finally adopted.
Veryl was to go to England, I to re
main behind in America. On the four
teenth day of June at high noon,
Greenwich time, she was to stand be
fore her father in Matlock and repeat
her responses. At the same Instant I
agreed to go through the ceremony at
my mother's home in Belmont. That
necessitated a slight postponement of
our honeymoon and the omission of a
bridal procession. Veryl grieved over
both features; I shared only half her
sorrow.
As time went on Veryl became quite
reconciled to our marriage plan, de
spite tha separation it involved. She
is a most unconventional little person
at all times, and the oddity of the
arrangement doubtless appealed to

morning. Don't hug me like that!
her strongly. With me it was other
wise. The glory of our engagement
Â¦was quite dimmed by the prospect of
her departure for the other side.
When she sailed on the first day of
June my grief was abyssmal. Mother
has since assured me that for three
entire days I ate not a morsel of food
â my thoughts were with a certain
ocean greyhound speeding over its
Atlantic lane, and I read and reread
nothing but storm reports and dere
lict statistics.
One Friday evening I found two
small tx'unks in our front hallway.
The maid informed me that they
were there by order of my mother.
When she came down for dinner that
evening I noted at once an air of
suppressed excitement about her, but
I asked no questions.
"Son," said she after we had seated
ourselves, "I bought your wedding
present to-day. See?"
WITH most people the story
ends after the heart interest
has been properly adjusted.
Thus: Proposalâ Acceptance
âTableauâ Finis.
In our case the situation reversed
Itself. I had suggested to Veryl, fer
vently, of course, that proper economy
would sanction the practice of sending
out her wedding Invitations and my
own in the same envelopes. With the
money saved thereby I agreed to pur
chase outright a ringâ a gleaming,
glistening affair with a large single
etone. To this day I do not know
whether she said yes. I have a vague
impression that she said nothing at
all. Presently I found myself seated by
her side holding her hand, which leads
me to suspect that some manner of af
firmation must have greeted my pro
posal. We were engaged. With that
our story starts. Thus: ProposalâAc
ceptanceâTableauâChapter One.
For the next few moments neither of
us spoke. We sat gazing into the open
fire, quiet and deliriously happy. Think
of it, Veryl was mine, my very own!
"Of what are you thinking:, dear?"
said I at length.
"I am thinking of our wedding, John.
It will be splendid to be married in
England."
"England?"
"Of course," she replied. "Don't you
remember? Father is at Matlock in
Derbyshire. When I last left him he
exacted from me a solemn promise that
I should never be married during his
lifetime, unless In his presence. I know,
dear, it means a long trip for both of
us, and the absence of a great many
of your friends from the ceremony. But
dad has my promise, and it must be
kept. Why, John, you are staring at
me as though I had committed a crime.
Don't look at me like that. Are you
afraid of the ocean voyage?"
"Not that, Veryll rqhe situation Is
worse â far worse. My mother is no
longer young, and I, am the last of
the brood. When I told her last night
what I expected to say to you, she ask
ed me to be married at once. 'Lad
die,' she said, 'I am getting old, and
before I go I want to see you mar
ried find settled down. Promise me,
son, that you will be married as soon
as possible, so that I can be here to
see my boy united to the woman of his
choice.' I promised."
"But your mother can go to England
with us, dearest."
"Impossible! She has a horror of the
ccean that nothing can conquer. Why
not bring your father to America?"
"If I waited for father to come to
America to see me married, John, I
must die a spinster. The last time we
crossed it took him four months to
summon up his courage to the point
of embarkation. Three times we
bought tickets; twice we forfeited our
deposits. Once on shore, he assured
me that he had suffered his last trip.
John, you are such a resourceful, clever
fellow that you must devise some way
out of our dilemma."
At first I suggested to Veryl that half
the ceremony be performed at Matlock
Yf IMMIE TOLLIVER regarded with
I decided Interest the tiny shoe
\ which lay on the center of the
Q^J white counterpane. He had a
quick eye for the attractive, and he
assured himself that this was a tri
umph of the cobbler's art; If, Indeed,
the maker of such a dainty creation
deserved such a commonplace appella
tion.
It wu a low-cut shoe with patent
leather sides and white kid facings,
quite an unusual combination. Some
how it seemed to appeal to Jlznmle
and he removed It from the bed to the
table, where It stood before his eyes
while be wrote the inevitable letter
home.
Then, while he lazily puffed a cig
arette, he Invested the dainty bit of
footgear with all the attributes of a
romance. How did It get there? Sure
ly no chambermaid, even in a high
priced hotel, had ever boasted the pos
session of each a creation. He turned
it over carefully, bnt there was not bo
much as a monogram In sight.
He retired to dreams which were
filled with visions ef tiny shoes that
suddenly resolved themselves Into the
moet beautiful girls and as unex
pectedly showed as mere shoes.
Indeed, but for the presence of the
choe on his table the next morning
he might have thought the whole af
fair was a dream, for how is a decided
ly feminine ehoe to find its way Into
the room of 6o confirmed a woman
hater as Jimmie Tolliver?
He placed the shoe on the bureau
as being safer than the table, and then
he went down to breakfast. He ran
upstairs afterward to change his coat
for a trip over the golf links, and
reached h!s Toom Just in time to catch
a strange chambermaid making off
vJth the shoe.
"See here, young woman, that's pet
ty larceny." warned Tolliver. "You
put that right back."
"I was olnly taking it for the lady
It belonged to," demurred the dusky
servant.
"Uh. uh!" said Tolliver. "Who Is the
lady it belongs to?"
The woman could only look around
helplessly. " 'Deed, Buh," she declared,
"the lady done tole me not to tell any
one."
"Hum!" said Tolliver gravely. "This
reed? looking into. It's absurd for you
to say that it's ybur own," with a
glance at hfr ponderous feet. "How
am I to tell that you are not taking it
to make a match receiver or a pin
cushion? I puess you had better leave
it here, and tell the owner to come and
prove property!" ._â¢';
"That's a fine Btory," he mused.
"It's a good two hundred feet across.
She must have ' plenty of "muscle."
Then to the girl, "You tell the lady to
send or bring the other shoe over and
she can have this one."
With a nod to the waiting girl, he
stepped inside the room, carefully
locked the shoe in his trunk, and then
went off to the links.
That afternoon Tolliver did a very
rude and inexcusable thing. He got
out a pair of strong opera glasses and
scanned the rooms across the court.
There was a band concert in the small
stand in the center of the courtyard
and he had a good look at the girls
across the way, but not one, he decid
ed, was fit to wear the shoe. With a
sigh be packed the shoe back in his
trunk.
But the shoe was not to be banished
from his thoughts. It became Instinct
with life. Everywhere he went he
looked for a woman whom he thought
might wear such a tiny shoe, but with-
out avail.
Then came a summons from his
mother. She was supplementing a
winter in Nassau with a few weeks at
Palm Beach, before going North, and
Jimmie was called to Join her there.
He left St. Augustine with regret, for
at St. Augustine was probably the un
discovered Cinderella. And in Palm
Beach was Vivlenne Carroll.
Now Tolliver particularly disliked
stood beside other girls. She had the
graces of a queen, and grave blue Â«yes
saved her from acquiring a reputation
as a flirt.
Tolliver, from the moment he to**
her llttla hand in his. wu aorry t^M
ha had not gone on to Nassau, azuS
that night when ha took the â¢lij>pÂ«*
out of tha tray of his trunk It somahÂ»in
seemed to have lost its old personality.
It only suggested Vlvienne.
In a short tima ha forgot the sllspea
entirely. He had awakened to a reali
zation of the fact that he was really la
love with Vivlenne Carroll, and ?>Â»Â»*.
for once he and his mother were In ao
cord on the matrimonial subject.
They were sitting on the broad plassa
the next night, Vivlenne â¢penlnjr an4
closing her fan nervously.
"Mr. Tolliver," she began with aa
edd diffidence In her voice, **I want i*
aak you Â¦oxnethlns."
"Even to the half of my ktardsm. 1 "
he quoted with mock heroics.
"Not the half of a kingdom." aba
corrected with a laugh; "the half of s>
pair of shoes."
"Eh? What?" stammered ToIUrear,
taken back.
"You have one of my shoes,** she
went on, "unless you've thrown it
away."
"I assure you," he Â«aid. "thÂ© only
lady's shoe I have is one that I found
on my bed in St. Augustine. A darkey
girl tried to make me believe that It
had been thrown into the window,
across a 200-yard court."
â¢ Vivlenne laughed.
"I'm not as strong aa that," Bhe de
clared. "You see you were almost in
the angle of the wall and the shoe flew
diagonally. I had run up from Nassau
to visit with Helen Redgold, and, as
I was leaving the next morning, I did
not have time to persist in my demand
for the shoe."
"How did you know I had it?" he
demanded, curiously.
"The maid told us who had the room,**
she explained.
"I'm sorry I can't give you that
shoe," he said half seriously, half in
jest, "you see I have made It one of
my household goods. The only way
you can sain possession is to take the
household along with It. Will you.
Vivlenne? I loved the wearer of that
little shoe until I met you; then I
loved you. It was all the Fame, but I
<!id not know It. Will you take tha
shoe back and me alons with it?"
It must have been all right, for Mrs.
Tolliver, nee Carroll, wears as a charm
a tiny gold shoo encrusted with dia
monds. It was her husband's wedding
gift and she calls it her mascot.
(Copyright, 1904. by E. W. Sargent)
Miss Carroll â not because he knew
her, but because his mother wanted
him to marry her and settle down. It
had originally been planned that Jlm
mle should run over to Nassau to meet
them and escort them home, and it
was because of Mlsa Carroll that ha
had not done so.
He took the train for Palm Beach,
mentally protesting, but even his de
votion to the unknown wearer of the
slipper was forgotten at sight of his
mother's guest.
She was slightly below average
height, but with a figure and carriage
that did not betray tha fact until sha
"'Deed ehe won't come, suh!" stam

TolIIver produced a two dollar bill.
"How did It come In my room?" he
asked.
The girl's eyes opened wide. "You
see thu lady "
"I wish I did," murmured Tolliver.
"The ladyâ shÂ« dun set foolln' wld a

STINSON'S DIPLOMACY

more significance than any other
month. Because of ill-health or
of insufficient means they are

ories of some honored seat of learning.
Is there any compensation for this
vast number of persons? Can a con
soling word be said with regard to the
possibilities of schooling outside the
schools? And if such a word can be
spoken, may it not apply also even to
the army of fair youns graduates, some

when one receives his ' diploma as
marking the finish of an education
would be as foolish as for an explorer
to think that when ho has once set
foot upon a new continent his discov
eries are at an end.
What would we all amount to, any
way, if the world itself were not a
great university, if life from morn. to

the acquisitive habit; study your com

ably with some men calls for a large
supply of self-control. To labor har

forbearance. To help lift them up to
your level demands an output of per

will always react beneficially upon you.

SCHOOLING APART FROM SCHOOLS
f * S~y IVE me a sensible girl," said
/ / Billy, as he unconsciously be-
V/jT gan to respond to Mrs. Jack's
\^ artful promptings of the last
half hour, which had, however, been so
deftly administered that he did not so
much as suspect that he was being
pumped dry on the subject of his ideal
woman. "Give me a girl with no non
sense about her."
He paused Impressively and stared
dreamily Into the haze of blue smoke
that surrounded them, as If striving to
call his Ideal clearly up before his
mind's eye.
"Venus de Jlilo waist and common
sense shoes t" suggested Mrs. Jack, who
for reasons of her own wished to get
the outer semblance of Billy's Ideal
trcrr.an clearly impressed upon her
memory.
Billy's glare withdrew itself from the
shadowy haze and rested upon his
friend's wife. For a brief moment his
taste wavered, deflected by the be
witching thinness of her daintily shod
foot, which had an ai>ologetlo air of be
ing more ornamental than usefuL Then
he reverted sternly td his ideal once
more.
"Erâ yes,** he began. "That is, if it Is
necessary," he added weakly, finding
his companion's appearance fatally an
tagonistic to his theories.
As she bad explained to her husband
while dressing: for dinner that evening,
ehe felt responsible for Billy, and
though the former had assured her that
Billy Teas a "husky brute" and could
take care of himself, she had not been
convinced.
"I took you away from him," had
argued with soft persistence, "and, of
course, he must be awfully lonely up
there in the old rooms. It isn't as if he
had you," she had ended with an inflec
tion that had caused her husband, who
â¢was at the moment deftly manipulating
his hair brushes, to flash a half-humor
ous glance at his image in the mirror
and then cross the room to her side.
With an orangewood stick in one
hand and the Cnger tips of the other
rosy and pomaded, she had reached
up and recklessly pulled his head
down beside her own. Temporarily,
the lonely Eilly had been forgotten.
Then, the very excess of their happi
ness had made her heart smite her.
Now encouraged by Mrs. Jack's
pympathetic, questioning eyes, Billy
rambled on, explaining that, though
he was not a marrying man, there
were moments when he hoped that
come time he might have a hearth of
his own, etc.. etc., etc Though ap
jarently listening with sweet Interest,
his hostess was in reality reviewing
the list of her friends In search of
the possible girl. One by one they
seemed to pass before her, a smiling,
teasing procession of blondes and
brunettes.
Then, Just as two worried lines of
thought began to appear on her
smooth forehead, â¢ and as Billy was
winding up with: "You see how it Is,
Mrs. Jack, the girls of to-day are' too
brilliant snd worldly for a humdrum
fallow like me!" the face of Virginia
Blair arose before her, and the lines
disappeared, in the radiance of a
bright, assured (smile.
Mr. Smith, as might be presumed
from his name, was naturally of a
cheerful turn of mind. Unpleasant
things simply did not exist for him.
No matter what happened he was able
to discover a bright side to it, even
down to murders and overdue bills and
other offenses against recognized laws
of nature and art. When he fell down
stairs and broke his leg he merely re
marked that this would give him a
good chance to conduct a careful scien
tific search into the age of Ann, and
when his six children came down with
the measles unanimously and simul
taneously he thanked kind heaven for
the opportunity to buy medicine at
wholesale rates. When It came to
cheerfulness he had the late Sunny
purposes of this careful Inquiry
into the true inwardness of
human fate we will assume that they
did not exist. Since it is necessary to
give these two individuals some sort of
handles so that they can be dis
tinguished with neatness and dispatch
and also to keeD their laundry from
gitting mixed, we will call one of them
Diogenes Jones and the other H. Hooli
gan Smith. The reason for inflicting
such burdens upon the poor men will
appear later on in this very interesting
discourse.
ONCE UDon a time there were two
man; there were some other men
at the same time, but for the
looked upon as a particularly useful
man, for the reason that it was not
believed that any one could get on hi3
blind side long enough to do the estab
lishment out of anything, while H.
Hooligan gained the reputation of a
man who, "while possessed of a bound
less and non-negotiable capital in the
shape of good will, was an easy mark
for any one who cared ?*Â¦ take the
trouble to fill him up with cheap cigars
and calorified atmosphere. If the two
men started out to walk vp the street
the chances were that Diogenes, shuf
fling along with his eyes on the ground,
as was his wont, would pick up a pock
etbook containing seven dollars * and
thirty-seven cents in cash and a recipe
for making mayonnaise salad dressing,
â¢while H. Hooligan, striding with hia
eyes lifted after the manner prescribed
by all the books on happiness, would
fall into an open coalhole and do irre
parable injury to his best trousers
And he would be extremely fortunate
if he wasn't arrested for stealing coal.
There are many other sad and illu
minating incidents in the careers of
these two men which might be cited as
throwing a larse and brilliant light on
the mutability of human affairs; for
example, H. Hooligan, believing that
things generally turn out in the best
way possible, refused to believe in the
sinfulness of sin to the extent of with
drawing hia nest ess when he had an
inside tip that the cashier of the sav
ings bank had been seen consulting the
time of the Montreal express and con
sequently he was able to contribute to
the best of his ability to the hotel bills
of that Napoleon of finance during his
indefinitely protracted stay In the Do
minion. Diogenes, true to his estab
lished doctrine that all flesh is weak,
especially when It is placed in close
contact with cold coin, made a run on
the bank at the first sign of trouble
and was in a position to tell II. Hooli
gan how frail a thing ia human nature
when not properly watched.
In the course of time and human
events Hooligan was advanced to tha
position of second assistant to the
secretary of the junior partner with a
salary about large enough to make
both ends come within hailing distance
of each other as long as the coal and
beef trusts stayed quietly on the res
ervation. Diogenes, because of his ad
mitted unapproachabillty by anything
short of a bench warrant or a ten-foot
pole,, was made a member of the firm
and was soon promoted to the post of
husband to the senior's favorite daugh
ter. There we can leave them; H. Hoo
ligan can't afford to get away during
our absence and Diogenes doesn't
want to; he can make more money
where he Is.
It must on no account be deduced
from this sad narrative that cheer
fulness i3 not a valuable asset in life's
bankruptcy court; In fact, we have
demonstrated conclusively that it isâ
to other people. The point which we
desire to make is that a laugh Is a
good thing, but it is even better to be
sure that it ia the last laugh that is
coming on that particular joke. We
would also remind the universe in
general that the willing horse la of
ten required to make two trips a day.
while the ewe reluctant equine stops
for lunch and has & rub-down and a
bran mash when the Journey la done.
James down and out in the first round.
Diogenes was the reverse of H. Hool
igan in every particular. He was the
sort of man who is always looking for
a hot wave in the summer and a howl
ing blizzard on the warmest winter day.
When other men put on their good
clothes and sallied forth to enjoy their
little day of happiness, Diogenes sat
at home and hugged his troubles and
made cold, unfeeling remarks anent the
exceeding brevity of human life and
the swiftness with which mortal pleas
ures pass away. It is suspected that
he had been fed on breakfast food in
his infancy, with the result that his
nature had become permanently
warped and soured. The only position
for which he seemed to be eminently
qualified by nature and temperament
was that of stamp clerk in the post
ofilce; it is quite likely that he could
have filled such a place in a manner
calculated to turn other stamp clerks
Â¦who were only moderately unpleasant
a deep green with envy.
The theory that is expounded above
found something which slightly re
sembled confirmation in the case of H.
Hooligan and Diogenes. The former
was the right hand man at every
church sociable within his jurisdiction.
When a man was wanted to stand on
the hurricane deck of a cold and heart
less icecream freezer while the guests
were blasting the night air upstairs
with "drop the handkerchief." "postof
flce," and other frivolous pastimes, H.
Hooligan was elected without a dis
senting vote. At dances he was al
ways selected on account of his cheer
fulness of disposition to keep the ladles
from whom the first bloom of youth
had more or less disappeared from
rubbing the flowers off the wallpaper-
Whenever any one was wanted to stay
after 6 at the office to get the letters
into shape for the next day's steamer
II. Hooligan was always the man for
the money, because he was so good
natured.
While he was thus spreading Joy and
happiness among his fellow-men by
taking all the disagreeable work off
their shoulders, Diogenes was pursuing
his hard and unsympathetic ,way, un
touched byâ or forâ the Joys and sor
rows of his kind. Every one knew that
he was a disobliging brute of a man,
; so he was never asked to dance with
any but the newest and freshest buds,
and the man who would have asked
him to foregather with an icecream
freezer would have put his life in dead
ly jeopardyâ not from Diogenes,- but
from the knowing ones who were
aware of that gentleman's disinclina
tion to do anything that any one
else wanted him to do. It was the
same way at the office; because he was
recognized as. the possessor of the
champion long-distance grouch of the
place the heads of the firm would as
soon have thought of asking the office
boy to earn his salary as to have ex
pected Diogenes to go out of his way
for the firm. In order that he might
not be dissatisfied with his work he was
given an extra long vacation and had
his pay boosted up twice as often as
any one else, so that the firm might
not be suddenly deprived of his inval
uable services.
In the course of time he came to be
"According to his own plans and
specificationsâ why, I'll punch his
head."
But In spite of his opportunities,
Billy remained cold to the charms of
joined him somewhat ruefully. But
the outburst was not followed by any
of the caustic remarks that might
have been expected from a bachelor
of his views and standing. On the
contrary, a genial, amused gleam lin
gered in his eyes, the amusement of
a grown-up with a dainty, foolish,
attractive child.
"Tessie is such a silly little thing,"
observed Mrs. Jack, apologetically,
"you mustn't mind her."
"Mind her!" ejaculated her visitor,
warmly, "I should say not! She's
great!" and he chuckled remlniscent
ly.
But on the subject of Miss Blair Mrs.
Jack found him unresponsive.
"Do you suppose he's Interested and
doesn't want to show it?" she demand
ed of Jack, that fountain of wisdom,
at the dinner table. "Because Vir
ginia's precisely the sort of a girl he
pretends to admire. Now that I've
found his Ideal for him he doesn't
seem to appreciate her."
Her husband laughed at the char'a
in her voice.
"If he doesn't fall in love with the
lady we've provided â "
"According to his plans and specifi
cations," giggled his wife.
'"She certainly Is good-looking In a
dreadfully noble manner," the young
matchmaker thought to herself as she
revolved schemes for bringing the two
together, "but I suppose Billy admires
that type. And she doesn't pinch her
feet or her waist. Obviously, she was
made for Billy."
At the dinner party which she gave
soon after for that particular, though
unexpressed, purpose of bringing them
together, Billy took Miss Blair out. She
was a tall, handsome girl, with dark,
serious eyes and smooth, heavy hair.
Before the first course had disappeared.
Billy had discovered that she and life
took each other seriously, and he had
an uncomfortable feeling, when her se
rious gaze fell upon him, that he was a
trivial sort of a fellow after all. When
she asked for his views upon municipal
reform, he was sure of it. He was as
confused and nonplused as If a canary
bird had suddenly begun to bark.
For years he remembered that dinner
with a Bort of horror. He and Miss
Blair, it seemed to him afterward, had
worked like galley slaves, discussing
all the knotty problems of the day.
Around them were lightness, gayety
and laughter, especially on the other
Bide of the table, where Tessie Loring,
who was the very embodiment of femi
nine frivolity, bubbled and dimpled and
cast languishing glances about her.
Mrs. Jack had often wondered wheth
er there would be anything left of Tes
sie should the dainty gown, hats, shoes
and veils be swept away, for she
seemed nothing more than a spirit born
of a collection of filmy garments.
"Swish of silk, flutter of lace, odor
of violets, flash of eyes and teeth and
eternal chatter!" Mrs. Jack summed up
ungraciously as she keenly noted
Billy's wandering glances. "What
possessed me to Include her In a party
for the benefit of a man who likes
sensible girls! I can see that he's
growing bo disgusted that he wants

a eha.de of suppressed annoyance she
rose, formulating an Intention to keep
Tessle as far as possible from Mr.
Staunton for the rest of the evening.
It seemed, therefore, almost too un
fortunate that the two should happen
to meet again at her house late one
afternoon of the following week, hav
ing been moved to make their bread
and-butter call at the same hour of
the same day.
Tessie was at her best â or worstâ
and rattled away In the patois of so
ciety in a manner that would have
been appalling had it been less pic
turesque. Billy's face was a study,
but whatever his thoughts' were, hl3
attention was unmistakable. Not one
of Tessle's glancesâ sometimes merry,
sometimes coquettish and sometimes
brimming with a babyish sweetness
intended to make him feel how big
and strong and different he wasâ
failed of Its mark. Tessie did not
know much, butÂ« that what she knew
she knew remarkably well was slowly
borne In upon Mrs. Jack during that
half hour.
When the distant thud of the front
door at last proclaimed her departure
from the premises Billy, who had
out-stayed her, burst into an uncon
trollable guffaw. In which his hostess

the sensible Miss Blair. In time Mrs.
Jack noticed that it became' increas
ingly difficult to throw them together.
Billy simply would not be thrown.
"Provide a man with what he pre
tends to like and he immediately finds
out that he doesn't want it^'/nhe reÂ»
fleeted with Justifiable cynicism. "He
says he likes sensible girls, but he
won't look at Virginia, though he will
hover about that little idiot, Tessie
Loring, like a moth about a flame."
And, Indeed, there was plenty of
foundation for her statement. Far from
causing Billy to talse to the woods, as
Mrs. Jack had feared she might, Tessie
seemed to exercise some subtle influ
ence over him. The two were forever
meeting, both at Mrs. Jack's and else
where, by the merest chance, of course.
And it was noticeable as time went on
that, though they arrived separately,
they invariably left together.
A month later he came to tell her of
their engagement.
"A good many persons misjudge Tes
sie," he began, as if he felt that she
might be one of the number, "but in
reality she is one of the most sensible
little girls in the world."
He said much more, and Mrs. Jack,
swallowing hard, accepted it all, agree
ing with him at every point. But when
she was alone again she laughed until
the tears streamed down her cheeksâ
and thus her husband found her.
"What under the heavens?" he in
quired, but he got no further.
"Billy's going to marry Tessie Lor
lng!" she announced breathlessly. "He
says she Is so sensible."
Jack gave a low, incredulous whistle.
"Talk about love being blind!" he
blurted out at last. "Why, love has an
X-ray eye! Nothing short of an X-ray
could see anything sensible in Tessie."
And he thrust his hands in his pock

HAIR WHICH BREAKS BADLY
(Mrs. P. B. J.)â When the hair grow*
readily and yet never attains any con
siderable length, wears off and breaks
on the. slightest provocation, it Is
manifestly the treatment of the hair
and not a disease of the scalp. As
you are a very restless sleeper, braid
ing the hair tightly and looping 1 it un
der in the nape of the neck before re
tiring, is very detrimental and is
largely responsible for its worn, un
even length. Braid it loosely after
brushing and confine the end only with
a narrow ribbon. In this way the
braid may be pushed aside instead of
being worn upon all night, as Is the
case when held closely to the head.
Instead of shampooing every week,
which is too often for hair inclined to
be very dry, keep the hair clean by
thorough brushing; shampoo only once
a month. You have so robbed the
hair of its natural oils that the ma
tured lengths are fast becoming life
less, so you must hasten to repair tha
waste by supplying oil to the scalp. A
very little oily dressing gently rubbed
Into the hair will also prove of
great benefit. To the fastidious woman
oily hair Is an abomination, but in this
case slight oiliness is absolutely essen
tial, for a time, to correct the brittle
condition. Get a bottle of pure vase
line, part the hair and with finger tips
go over the entire scalp, rabbins in all
that it will absorb, but no more. When
the work is finished there should be
no suspicion of offensive greasiness.
It is best to have another person do
this work for you to avoid daubing
the hair. For the hair dressing, and
it is also excellent rubbed Into the
scalp to soften the hair, prevent it
falling out and promote Its growth,
have the following mixture prepared
by the druggist: One ounce castor oil,
one ounce alcohol, six ounces bay

thirty drops of oil of lemon. Shake
well and apply once or twice each day.

This new art, by the way, is called

by the use of dyes or water color paints
appliqued to the outline, as in any

paper is placed underneath the -fabric

vantage.
For the girl who wishes to look cool
and sweet on warm days the various
shades of tans and browns are espe
cially appropriate. And she doesn't
stop even there, for every now and
then she delves about until she dis
covers a tan linen that especially
pleases her fancy and then she
marches herself home in high glee and
embroiders it with a heavy silk or a
soft floss, but always in black, mind
you. And black, by the way. is not
under the ban that it used to be. The
lassie who affected the somber tones
was scolded and preached to by her
admiring relatives until in sheer de
spair she discarded the shimmering
frocks and sallied forth In white, in
baby blues and in soft, delicate pinks.
The cry was, "Black is old enough for
your grandmother." Now it is quite
reversed, for it suddenly dawned upon
Dame Fashion that the time for her
to wear black is when she is young,
fresh and free ,from wrinkles. For
black, be it known, brings out all the
ugly little crows' feet and unsllghtly
lines that never fail to be such a bug
bear with women.
Chiffon is always worn more or less
and, by the way, it was our English
cousines who first taught us to wear
chiffon in summer and in winter alike.
Some were malicious enough to say it
was for economy's sake, but whether
it was or not, the fact remains Just
the same that a soft, pretty fluff is al
ways pretty and it never fails to add
its mite.
The collar effects of this year's vin
tage are another boon to the girl who
must consider her purse first and last.
Yet if she be clever with her needle
she can fashion some of braid that
are chic and that do quite as well as
the handsomest lace in the shop.
Hands of braid, made up in three or
four color3, are used in fashioning a
design upon the yoke, and very wide
pieces of lace outlined with narrow
shirrings of ribbon also have their
place in the collar scheme.
The woman who wants to look nice
all the time and who wants to look
nice in all her gowns, no matter how
old and how plainly they may be made,
should provide herself with several lace
yokes. And now because lace in such
an endless variety of ways has been
used so extensively do not labor under
the impression that it is about to go
out, for the newest and the latest Par
isian creations show yoke and collar
effects and billows and billows of eoft,
tumbling lace.
So it behooves vou to invest In one
quite as large as a cape, and which is
cut rounding in the neck. This is to
throw over the shoulders of an old
gown, and believe me, it does cover up
a multitude of sins. Then again a lace
collar which does not quite come to the
shoulders and which buttons or fastens
in the back is an excellent Investment. -
This can be secured with fancy pins or
with tinv buttons, but if it is made to
launder the pins are far better.
The yoke, by the way, while quite deep,
should also be high in the neck, for it
takes the place of a fancy stock as
.well.
Any material which is perishable is
seldom even a good investment, es
pecially these days when the manufac-

brightest colors, for lÂ»e it known the
day of white unadorned has passed, and
the Ilikimanian embroidery, with its
say. giddy colorings, is here, and here
with a v^ngfanti'.
The grirl who is beautiful in her own
right does not negl^-t the tonic effect
of new and fashionable clothing, and
collars are a something that she eter
xial!y and forever finds herself sadly in
need of. So the newest and most be
fpmlng blues, the brightest and the
prettiest tones of red and the softest
tans are pinned ubout her slender
throat, apparently .serving as a neck
gear, but in reality bringing out her
best Qualities. For these days there
are few women who do not fully realize
that if they are lovely it is only be
cause they know how to dress. The
eyes of blue would frequently pass
entirely unnoticed, but when brought
out by a turquoise they are surpassing
ly pretty.
And Ko it chances that the woman
w hÂ« wants to look trim and neat and
particularly fetching wears this little
novelty and revels in being well dressed
aud unart-appearing on very little
money. People forget and forgive
styles if th*Â» are good, and novel

It takes but two pins to secure them
firmly in place, and for this one reason
they ar<> a. decided comfort and a great
convenience.
The band about the neck is a fitted
one. and may liave tabs, or what is
commonly known as "top collars," if
one bo pleases. The rest is surprisingly
simple suid yet charmingly pretty and
effective. One end of the tie â and there
are two separate and distinct onesâ Is
stitched up on the machine, and one is
always broader than the other. Of
â¢ â¢ours?, it goes without saying the
broad end !â¢* the one that is permitted
to whirl where and when it pleases
vith the summer breeze.
The top piece is the one that gives
the smart appearance, for upon it are
all the decorations, and one's entire
color nr.heme must harmonize or else
the combination is entirely wrong.
This piece, shaped as the under one,
is laid over the plain linen and the two
are sewed firmly in place Just under
the top collar, so that the stitches and
the seams may not show and, lo and
behold! the trick Is complete. And 6uch
a trick, by the way, is a veritable treas
ure, for it can be made to do duty for
many occasions with very little work

The embroidery may be as fancy or

may be exactly of what one pleases, for
there is no set rule, and, If the truth

may be purchased with the pattern

14the imaginary appreciation of the pas
sersby, who had been attracted by the
unusual sight, had gradually parted
with his raiment, piece by piece, .until
his uncle's opportune arrival alone had
saved tho youngest member of .the
house of Pflster from coming home In a
barrel and a state of nature.
Mrs. Pflster decided that heroio
measures were necessary at once, and
turned Perkins over to his father. The
latter succeeded In convincing: his son
that popular applause was not an es
sential accompaniment to charity, and
that secrecv and good Judgment were
more to be praised than ostentation;
all of which, being reduced to words of
one and two syllables, was duly ab
sorbed ty Perkins.
That night at the table Perkins was
permltteJ to come in for dessert, and
he gravely listened to an argument be
tween Jack and pretty Grace Tyson as
to the value of fresh ajr funds. It was
a hobby with Miss Tyson, and Jack
was Jealous of the time she devoted to
the fund, because it interfered with
their mutual pleasures.
Perkins drank in Miss Tyson's glow
ing description of the joys of the city
child in the country and the willing
ness of the farmers to take them for a
week. He decided that she must be
right, though. He was unacquainted
with fresh air funds. Usually he was
sent to, the country in May, but this
year some especial club business re
quiring his mother's presence in town,
their departure hail been deferred.
Meanwhile there was anxiety in the
Pflster home. Perkins had not come
home for lunch. All of the relatives
were telephoned, and a clew was se
cured from Mr. Montgomery, who re
lated the incident of the five-dollar do
nation.
ciety. He provided Perkins with
tickets to a town a short distance up
the river. With the change Perkins
purchased a generous luncheon of
cough drops and peanuts, and, thus
equipped, the first personally , con
ducted excursion of the Perkins' fresh
air fund made a start.
It was a ride of an hour and a half
by slow train to their destination; the
lunch disappeared and the children
were tired and quarrelsome. When
Perkins with blind â¢ confidence, an
nounced himself and his party as a
"fresh air fund" and demanded to be
shown . the farmers who delighted to
take in children, the station agent, who
had been tormented that morning try
ing to. handle the real party, promptly
sent for the police force of two con
stables. The party was taken into cus
tody.
Huddled Into one small room In the
village lockup, things were not well
with Perkins. He had promised an
outing, and Instead they had been ar
rested. Boy-like, they took . prompt
and summary vengeance upon Per
kins, who formed the lowest layer of
a pyramid of six energetic youths just
as Miss Tyson was ushered into the
room. The constables soon separated
the combatants and bit by bit the story
came out. : Miss Tyson first laughed,
then she cried and t then she kissed
Perkins a great many times, for Per
kins favored his mother â and Jack
Pflster. , .
Jack Pflster's quick wit solved the
rest of the problem. Perkins* freaks
were a constant source of delight to
him, and he saw In a moment how the
argument of the night before had borne
fruit. A telephone inquiry at the rail
road station confirmed his theory and
barely had Miss Tyson made Perkins
and his companions comfortable at the
"Fund" headquarters, when Jack ar
rived on an express and made straight
for the headquarters as the first place
of Inquiry.
Perkins did not know whether Jack
was the more glad to see him or Miss
Tyson, but he was certain that Miss
Tyson cried very much more over Jack
than she had over him. At any rate,
hi3 explanation that he was merely
trying to carry out the paternal in
junction not to make a display of his
good works fell upon unheeding ears,
for Jack was protesting that- he had
been a cad the night before, and Miss
Tyson was vehemently declaring that
he was a shamefully neglected and de
cidedly dear boy, which explanation
being made she took back the ring."
Then, because it was too . public a
place to kiss Jack, she kissed Perkins
even more than she had in the lockup,
to that young \man's great bewilder
ment,-for it had been- more 'than an
hour since he had been found. Then
he and Uncle Jack went back to town,
.where Perkins was. made much of by
the family. '
"I think," he said, late In the even-

drowsily upon his mother's shoulder,
"that when you don't tell more people

which sage conclusion he went to bed,
while Jack Pflster went to the library
to write to Grace.
(Copyright, 1904, by Epes W. Sargent.)
After that she decided that It would
be well to wait until "Perkins" should
have arrived at more mature years be

afternoon Jack arrived with "Perkins"
under his arm, the boy clad only in
his trousers. Between roars of laugh

It was Jack Pflster, also, who had
declared "Perkins" to have been born
a professional philanthropist. From his
babyhood "Perkins" had been pos

only by his desire that his gifts be her

In vain to instill into his mind the value

had even sought to enforce her argu

till you reach the trim Dutch garden,
meat encircled, in the center of which
â¢tands the prim, old-fashioned villa
which to the simple Dutchman appears
a palace. The concierge, an old soldier,
bows low to you and introduces you
to his wife, a stately white-haired
fiaxne who talks most languages a lit
tle â so far as relat' _ to all things
within and appertaining to this tiny
palace of the wood. To things without,
beyond the wood, her powe- of con
versation do not extend; apparently
euch matters do not interest her. She
conducts you to the Chinese room; the
eun streams through the windows, il
luminating the wondrous golden
dragons standing out in bold relief
from the burnished lacquer work, deco
rating still further with light and shade
the delicate silk embroideries thin taper
hands have woven with infinite pains.
The walls are hung with rice paper,
depicting the conventional scenes of
the conventional Chinese life. You find
your thoughts wandering. These gro
tesque figures, these caricatures of hu
manity! A comical creature surely
this Chinaman, the pantaloon of Eu
rope. How useful he has been to us;
for our farces, our comic operas! This
yellow baby, in his ample pinafore,
who lived thousands of years ago, who
has now passed Into this strange sec
ond childhood. But is he dyingâ or
does the life of a nation wake again,
-as after sleep? Is he this droll harm
less thing he here depicts himself?
And if not? Suppose fresh sap Is stir
ring through his three hundred mil
lions? We thought he was so very
dead, we thought the time had come
to cut him up and divide him. the only
danger being lest we should quarrel
over his carcass among ourselves. Sup
pose It turns out as the fable of the
woodcutter and the bear? The wood
cutter found the bear lying In the for
est. At first he was much frightened,
but the bear lay remarkably still. So
the woodman crept ne'arer, ventured to
kick the bearâ very gently, ready to
run if need be. Surely the bear was
dead! And parts of a bear are good to
eat, and bearskin to poor woodfolk on
cold winter nights !s grateful. So tha
woodman drew his knife and commenc
ed the necessary preliminaries. But the
bear was not dead. If the Chinaman
be not dead? If the cutting up process
has only served to waken him? In a
little time from now we shall know.
From the Chinese the white-haired
dame leads us to the Japanese room.
Had gentle-looking Princess Amalia
Bonaa vague foreshadowing of the fu
ture In her mind when Bhe planned
these two rooms leading into one an
other? The Japanese decorations are
more grotesque, the designs less cheer
fully comical than those of cousin Chi-
These monstrous, misshapen wrest
lers, these patient-looking gods with
their inscrutable eyes'. Was it always
there, or is it only by the light of pres
ent events that one reads into the
fantastic fancies of the artist working
long ago In the doorway of his paper
house a meaning that has hitherto es
caped us? But the chief attraction of
the Huls ten Bosch is the gorgeous
Orange Saloon, lighted by a cupola,
fifty feet above the floor, the walls one
blaze of pictures, chiefly of the gor
geous Rubens school; "The Defeat of
the Vices," "Time Vanquishing Slan
der" â most allegorical, in praise of
all the virtues, in praise of enlighten
ment and progress. Aptly enough in a
room so decorated here was held the
famous Peace Congress that closed the
last century. One can hardly avoid
smiling as one thinks of the solemn
conclave of grandees assembled to pro
claim the popularity of peace. It was
in the autumn of the same year that
Europe decided upon the partition
of China, that soldiers were instructed
by Christian monarchs to massacre
men, women and children, the idea
being to impress upon the heathen
Chinese the superior civilization of the
white man. The Boer war followed al
most immediately. Since when the
white man has been pretty busy all
over the world with his "expeditions"
and his "missions." The world undoubt
edly Is growing more refined. We do
cot care for ugly words. Even the
burglar refers airily to the "little Job"
he has on hand. I should not be sur
prised to learn that he . ;-s a prayer
"I am luring him on," he will add,
"as fast as I can. ; At our present rate
of progress I am in hopes of bringing
him home by tha 10th." Lest foolish
civilian sort of people should wonder
whereabout lies the cause of rejoicing,
the military man will condescend to
explain. The enemy is being enticed
farther and farther from his base. The
defeated general â who is not really de
feated, who Is only artful, and who ap
pears to be running away, is not really
running away. On the contrary he is
running home, bringingâ as he explains
â the enemy with him. If I remember
rightlyâ it is long since I played it
there Is a parlor game entitled "Puss
in the Corner." You beckon another
player to you with your finger. "Puss,
puss," you cry. Thereupon he has to
leave his chairâ his "base," as the mili
tary man would term It â and try to get
to you without anything happening to
him. War in the future is going to be
"Puss In the Corner" on a bigger scale.
You lure your enemy away from his
base. If all goes well â if he does not
see the trap that is being laid for him â
arbitrate, and feel virtuous. For gold
mines and good pasture land, mixed up
with a little honor to give respectabil
ity to the business, we shall fight it
out, as previously. War being thus
Inevitable; tha humane man will re
joice that by one of those brilliant dis
coveries, so simple when they are ex
plained, war In the future is going to
ba rendered equally satisfactory to
victor and to vanquished. In by-elec
tions, as a witty writer has pointed
out, there are no defeats; only v'c
torier and moral victories. The idea
seems to have caught on. War in the
future Is evidently going to oe con
ducted on the same understanding.
Once upon a time, from a far-off land,
a certain general telegraphed home
congratulating his Government that
the enemy had shown no Inclination
whatever to prevent his running away.
The whole country rejoiced. "Why
they never even tried to stop him," cit
izens, meeting other citizens in the
street, told each other. "Ah, they've
had enough of him. Why, they say he
ran for miles without seeing a trace
of the foe." The enemy's general, on
the other hand, wrote home congratu
lating his Government. In this way the
same battle can be mafficked over by
both parties. Contentment is the great
secret of happiness. Everything hap
pens for the best, if only you look at
it the right way. That Is going to be
the argument. The general of the fu
ture will telegraph to headquarters
that he is pleased to be able to Inform
his Majesty that the enemy, having
broken down all opposition, has suc
ceeded in crossing the frontier and Is
now well on his way to nls Majesty's
capital.

he finds himself In your capital. That
finishes the game. You find out what
It is he really wants (provided it la
something within reason, and you hap
pen to have It handy you give it to
him). He goes home crowing; and you,
on your side, laugh when you think
how cleverly you succeeded la luring
him away from his base. Thers is a
bright Bids to all things. ThÂ» gentle
man charged with the defense of a
fortress will meet the other gentleman
who has captured It and shaka hands
vrith him amid tha ruins. "So, her*
you are at last," he will exclaim. "Why
didn't you coma before? "We have been
waiting for you." And ha will send off
dispatches felicitating his chief on hav
ing got that fortress off their hands,
together with all the worry and ex
pense It has been to them. .
When prisoners are taken you will
console yourself with the reflection that
the cost of feeding them will have to
be borne by the enemy. Captured can
non you will watch being trailed away
with a sigh of relief. "Confounded heavy,
things!" you will say to yourselff.
"Thank goodness, I've got rid of them.
Let him have the fun of dragging them
about these ghastly roads. See how ha
likes tha Job!" War Is a ridiculous
method of settling disputes. Anything
that can tend to make its ridiculous
aspect more apparent is to be wel
comed. The new school of military
dispatch-writers may succeed in turn-
Ing even the laughter of the mob
against it. The present trouble in the
East would never have , occurred but
for the white man's enthusiasm for
bearing other people's burdens. What
we call the yellow danger Is the fear
that the yellow man may before long
request us, so far as he 13 concerned,
to put his particular burden down. It
may occur to him that, seeing It is
his property, he would Just as soon car
ry it himself. A London policeman
told me a story the other day that
struck him as an example of Cockney
humor under trying circumstanoes. But
it may also serve as a fable. From
a lonely street in the neighborhood of
Covent Garden early bna morning the
constable heard cries of "Stop, thief 1"
shouted in a childish treble. He ar
rived on the scene Just in time to col
lar a young Hooligan who, having
snatched a basket of fruit from a Â»maC
ladâ a greengrocer's errand boy, aa it
turned outâ was with It making tracks.
Tha greengrocer's boy, between pant
ing and tears, delivered his accusation.
The Hooligan regarded him with an
expression of amazed Indignation.
"What d'yer mean, stealing it?** ex
claimed Mr. Hooligan, "why, I waa
carrying It fer yer!" The white man
has got into the way of "carrying"
other people's burdens; and now It
looks as if the yellow man wera going
to object to out carrying his any fur
ther. Maybe hÂ« is going to get nasty
and Insist on carrying it himself. We
call this "the yellow danger." A friend
of mineâ he la a man who in the street
walks into lamp posts and apologizesâ
sees rising from the East the dawn of
a new day In the world's history. The
yellow danger is to him a golden hope.
He sees a race long stagnant stretch-
Ing its giant limbs with the first vague
movements of returning life. He is a
poor sort of patriot; he calls himself, I
suppose, a white man. yet he shame
lessly confesses ha would rather sea
Asia's millions rise from the ruins of
their ancient civilization to take part
in the future of humanity than that
half the population of the globe should
remain bound in savagery for tha
pleasure and profit of his own particu
lar species. He even goes so far 'as to
think that the whlta man may have
something to learn. The world has be
longed to him now for some thousands
of years. Has he done all with it that
could have been done? Are his ideals
the last word? Not what the Yellow
man has absorbed from Europe It is
that Interests my friend. He Is watch
ing the birth of a new force; an influ
ence as yet unknown. He clings to the
fond belief that new ideas, new for
mulae to replace the old worn shibbo
leths may" during these thousands of
years have been developing In those
keen brains that behind tne Impressive
yellow mask have been working so long
In silence and in mystery.

very simple, too. It would be easy to
find a lot of poor children, and his
Uncle Montgomery would finance tha

now see each other as often as they
please. When the wedding day draws
nighâ in accordance with another old
Spanish customâ the bride receives
from the bridegroom the gift of -two
or three dresses and some Jewelry, and
the latter is presented by the former
with the gold studs which he is to
wear In his shirt on the day of the mar
riage ceremony, and, besides this, the
fiancee Is obliged to purchase all the
furniture required for the bridal cham
ber of her new dwelling; the nuptial

furnish all the other rooms In -the

As regards the marriage ceremony
it is unnecessary to describe It, as it
differs little from that gone through
with elsewhere, but It may not be out
of place to remark that nobody in
Spain marries either on a Tuesday or
on a Wednesday, because these days
are considered most unlucky for such
ventures.

TWO BEAUTIFUL DAUGHTERS OF SUNNY'SPAIN.
Distinguished Antiquarian Has Fol
lowed Line to Beginning of
Seventeenth Century.
LONDON, July 16.â President Roose
velt's mother was a Miss Bulloch of
Georgia, but few facts have been pub
lished with regard to her family, for
the President cannot trace it further
back than to the Bulloch who settled
in South Carolina at the beginning of
the eighteenth century.
A distinguished antiquarian who has
been investigating the history of the
family says that the Bullocks came
almost to a man from the little parish
of Baldernoch, Stirlingshire, the regis
ters of which are fairly complete from
the beginning of the seventeenth cen
tury down to the present time.
They unquestionably were of Celtic
origin and married for generations into
Highland families. The name originally
was Balloch. It did not take the form
of Bulloch until the middle of the
eighteenth century, when the changes
in nomenclature affected by the Jacob
ite rebellion would seem to have af
fected It.
Not one of the family 13 to be found
at Baldernoch to-day, and though
there are representatives in America
and Canada, the family manifest a
tendency to die out completely, which
seems to show that Mr. Roosevelt does
not inherit from his maternal ancestors
his convictions about increasing tha
ia.ee.
HE TRACES THE ANCESTRY
OF PRESIDENTS MOTHER
tender relations between the young
people continue, the good mother per
mits her daughter to introduce the
young man to her and after consulting
her husband Invites him to her house,
treating him at first, however, simply
as a friend. Then it Is seen whether
the young man seriously thinks of mar
rying or whether he merely treats the
affair as a pastime.
In the latter case he is politely sent
about his business by the mother of
the girl. If, on the other hand, the
swain Is satisfied that the character
and education of his sweetheart suit
him, he presents himself to her father,
tells him that he loves the girl, that
she reciprocates his love and asks per
mission for their formal engagement.
Meanwhile, the father has already
made inquiries concerning the youth,
his social position and that of his fam
ily; and if the Information .received
proved satisfactory he gives the young
man a favorable answer.

man in the British peerage who knows
better how to dress well and at -the

Curzon. When he arrived in Lon
don the other day after his five years
In India a ! number of smart tailors
were on the railway platform waiting
to see the Immaculately dressed
"Georgie Curzon," as he is familiarly
known to West End outfitters. They
gazed in admiration on his faultlessly
fitting frock coat and' carefully
pressed trousers, and wondered if
they could be the same for which he
was measured ' when he received ; his
Indian appointment. : His Lordship
has the reputation \ of being able, by
careful manipulation, . to wear his
clothes out to the last thread. One
of his valets is always a practical
tailor, and it Is his duty to see to his
Lordship's clothes. His wardrobe
consists of seven coats, seven pairs
of trousers and seven waistcoats. He
wears one of each once a. week, so
that no one has ever seen him, since
he became a public man, wear the
same coat or pair of trousers two
days consecutively. In this way he
established a reputation for being one
of the best dressed men in Parliament,
although his wardrobe is of so lim
ited a capacity. His- linen was . al
ways spotless, too. He has seven
pairs of boots, and those are most
carefully soled and heeled when the
necessity arises just like, the pedal
coverings of any plebeian. Alto
gether it is estimated his . clothing
never costs him "more than $500 a
year. Valets never made a cent out

LONDON, July 16.â Whether the
hopes for a big American season will
be realized this year is still a great
matter of conjecture and In many quar
ters It is almost possible to say that
they will not. At some of the very
best /hotels In London It has been as
certained that there Is a tremendous
falling off not only in the number of
American visitors who were expect
ed as a matter of course, but among
those who some three or four months
ago had actually, engaged their rooms
at the different hotels, for these now
write to countermand their order, giv
ing some trifling excuse for their
change of plans. At one leading hotel
quite half the rooms ordered some time
ago will not be required this season,
and at many of the other hotels the
percentage Is almost as high.
Many of those who are arriving and
making plans to reach London are to
stay at the hotels but two or three
days, instead of weeks. And instead
of passing on to the Continent for a
long tour, going from one pleasure re
sort to another and spending money
freely they will go to some quiet out
of the way and very Inexpensive place
in Switzerland and stay there for the
whole of the summer, husbanding their
money. To keep up appearances many
feel that they must come to Europe
as usual and by the folks at home It
13 imagined the same brilliant round of
gayety will be entered into, but in
London the mode of their coming is
found to he very different and on all
sides j there Is ! fear that this will be
but a sorry season so far as the Amer
ican visitors are concerned.

the way her husband's name has been

Her Ladyship is one of the best-loved"

If the sale of the pictures had been

not have caused much surprise, but
some of the pictures sold realised as
much as $2750. This Is the second time
In its history that Blenheim has had
to be stripped to replenish the ducal
exchequer. The last occasion was when
the nation acquired a Raphael and a
Vandyke at a cost of $625,000. These
two pictures now hang In the National

ever driven to the same extremity.
BRING JLARGE PRICES.
Gossip Is busy In regard to the rÂ«a
sons which have led the Duke of Marl*
borough to dispose of a number ct his
toric pictures during the past week.
One story is that the allowance fur
nished by Papa Vanderbilt is not sofa

political appointment as that held by
the Duke. Another is that the As
sistant Colonial Secretary has returned
to his old habits of going the pace.

and It Is no uncommon thing to find
a young swell with an Income less than
$10,000 a year paying up on Monday,
which is settling day. losses amounting
from $1000 to $2000.
How the whole thing has been kept
a secret it is quite beyond her relatives*
power to conceive and, like the rest of
society, they are wondering where such
mesalliances will cease. The marrlasa'
was evidently an accomplished fact
before the death. In November. 1901. of

son who married Miss Elizabeth Kirk-
Patrick of Salt Lake City some four
years ago.
LONDON 1 . July 18. â London society
no sooner had begun to exclaim over a
contemplated mesalliance by one of Its
fair members than another ouch scan
dal became an actual fact, and an
even more astounding third has mada
the fashionable world gasp. The Oroe
venor Square girl of whom I wrota re
cently, and who â though she has only
$5000 a year now, will have an annual
hundred thousand or so later on
started the ball a-rolllng. Her choice
fell upon her handsome chauffeur.
Emma, the Dowager Countess of
Ravensworth, has gone one better and
married her coachman at St. George's,
Hanover Square, one of the leading
churches In London for fashionable
marriages. And now, as if to outdo all
such mesalliances, and to become her
self the central figure In the wholo
round of comment on this most absorb
ing topic, the daughter of Lord Hood of
Avalon has just revealed to her aston
ished relatives that she haa not only
been married for three years to thÂ« tt.*â¢
who feeds her father's poultry at the-
Hoods' place in the country but that,
besides, she has two children of tha
marriage.
SECRET WELL K I-'.PTt
To this may be added that there are
few girls who cannot play on some In
strument, the piano or the guitar, sing
some couplets d'amour and dance
besides the common measures the
graceful and chare- âistic dances of
the country; and so it will be readily
understood that the Spanish girl of the
middle class need never lack an ad
mirer, especially as, like the majority
of young women, she mayâ without the
slightest ind-- Drumâ have three or four
lovers, successively, before marrying.
The different phases of these transient
Jove affairs are really curious. When
On the other hand, although it Is be
coming increasingly difficult for a
young woman of the Spanish bour
geoisie to secure a husband, it is ex
ceedingly easy for her to find a beau.
Though she is generally not tall, she is
very pretty, or, at least, well formed
and of a most pleasing physiognomy.
She has large eyes, usually dark and
very expressive; a little nose, slightly
turned up; much hair, which she combs
with infinite care and arranges with
much art; she has a most graceful style
of walking, possesses natural elegance
and dresses tastefully, although she
prefers somewhat showy colors. Her
manners are charming and Â«-h<? is good
humored and frank.
Although she exhibits herself so
much, it must not be believed that the
Spanish girl always finds it easy to get
a husband. It is indeed true that
Spain occupies (or, at least, has occu
pied until lately) the second place
among European nations so far as the
number of marriages registered annu
ally Is concerned; but now that the cost
of living is increasing so fast in Spain
young men are growing more and more
reluctant about assuming new respon
sibilities. Besides, there exists another
unfavorable circumstance, and that is,
that according to the last census there
are in Spain nearly 600,000 more women
than men. In Madrid alone the women
exceed the men in number by 30,000!
EASY TO FIND A BEAU.
At sixteen years, at the latest, the
young woman leaves schoool, and from
that moment. It may be said, begins
for her the chase after a husband.
"Chase" really is the only word for it.
CHASING A HUSBAND.
Under the constant supervision of her
mother, who usually favors the matri
rnoniaJ aspirations of her daughter* â
th* young girl commences to frequent
assiduously the public walks, private
reunions and the theaters. She goes
out in the morning on the pretext of
going shopping or to church, but in
reality to be seen of young men; in the
tftprroon, after dinner, she embroiders
a little (she prefers embroidery to sew
ing) or attends to the making of her
own dresses, and then she goes out
cgiin to the promenades. At night
she either goes to the theater or stays
at home and receives her friends. Mu
sic and dancing nearly always accom
pany these soirees.
MADRID. July 16.â If there really is
a little god of love he must be rather
distressed just now over a change that
Is elowly but surely talcing place in
Epala. There Is reason to believe that
M*. trhleh all the world knows as the
land of courtship and of love songs,
thrummed beneath casement windows
to guitar accompaniments; where, In
fact, almost everything Is of less im
portance thaa the tender passion, may
shortly become prosaic like the rest of
the universe. And the reason Is this:
The Spanish girl Is going to work!
Seriously, this Is a development
â¢which may be expected to make a real
difference In the national life. It is
one, too, thai a few years back would
have seemed almost Impossible to those
who know tlie stiff prejudice of all
classes in 6p&ln regH.rdingÂ«women in
trade. One would have said that the
Elrls cf America, England or any other
country might become typewriters,
work In stores or enter the professions
â but not those of Spain. In this land
the Idea always has been that a girl's
energies should be put forth with just
en*Â» object, that of getting married!
Now, however, as In other countries,
woman doctors and dentists are mak
ing their appearance In Spain, some
erfrls are going into business and others
entering Government offices and the
principal banking bouses.
PLAIN NECESSITY.
This sudden desire to earn money on
the part of Spanish girls is by no
means owing to any new fangled ideas
regarding the "true mission of woman
in modern society," or to any wish for
more liberty, or to become more inde
pendent. It is due to just plain neces
j-.ty. Living in Spain is getting dearer
every day, especially in Madrid and
the other large cities, and in most
rates girls are going to work simply
because their parents' incomes no
longer suffice to rr.ake both ends meet.
National prejudice is just as much
against the notion of girls' in business
as ever it was, but unless times get
better in this country undoubtedly in
time the ancient feeling on the Eubject
will go by the board, and the 'business
g;ii" become as familiar an object as
the is either in the United States or
Hngland to-day.
In that case courtship will have to be
relegated to as comparatively subord
inate a place as it now occupies in
more matter-of-fact lands, which will
be a mighty change indeed, for it is
really remarkable what an immense
e mount of time the average Spanish
girl now devotes to matters of the
heart.

bride, and this at the. latest is a year
after the young woman's hand has
been asked for. The betrothed may
He passes hours under the balconies
of her house and follows her. like her
shadow, about the streets and In the
theaters and, if he Is not already per- #
sonally acquainted with her. he seeks
to be admitted to th<Â» gatherings at
which she is present, so as to find an
opportunity to be introduced to her and
declare his admiration.
More daring than an Anglo-Saxon, if
the Spanish Romeo cannot manage to
obtain an introduction, he writes his
divinity a love letter, which the door
keeper or a servant at her house, on
receipt of a little tip. undertakes to de
liver to the young lady. By the same
means he shortly afterward receives an
answer from' his fairâ and in this re-,
spect â rather unconventional charmer.
Of course, the mother of the girl Is not
long in discovering that her daughter
has an admirer, and if the matron
knows or believes she knows that the
lover is a desirable young man, she
gives her daughter good advice and
then, for the time being, lets things
take their course, although she watches
the grirl more closely than before. From
that moment the girl and her lover,
besides meeting on the promenade and
at the theaters and parties, write each
other long letters every day; and in the
evening have equally lengthy chats, she

pose a sort of small pocket telephone,
which is called here, in jest, "love's
telephone."

a young man Is convinced that the girl
â¢who has attracted him Is likely to ac
cept his addresses he immediately
makes her the object of what might
well be termed constant and systematic
persecution.

her own about the most comfortable
way to wear one's hair while in the
water. "I go bathing nearly every
day," she said recently, "and I am con
stantly asked how I am able to keep
my hair dry and glossy for the even
ing performance. I don't mind letting
you in on the secret, as I think it is
one worth knowing and will be of gen
uine benefit to many girls who are as
fond of the water as I am, but dislike
to wet their hair so as not to be pre
sentable at the theater or a dinner
party. Before going in bathing I dress
my hair exactly as I do for my work
in the theater. I comb my hair straight
back from my forehead, tie my wig
band tightly over it and then don a
thick, curly wig, which I fasten secure

Fred Stone recently interpolated a,
telling and effective catch-line in "The
Wizard of Oz." When he makes his en
trance as the Scarecrow in the scene
of the field of the deadly poppies he
exclaims: "I'm so ner-vous." The first
time he Introduced this gaff it evoked
an immediate roar of laughter from the
audience, and the comedian was
thereupon induced to repeat it in two
other scenes of the play â once again in
the episode where the Wizard injects
brains into his pate and again in the
last act, where he is Imprisoned in the
wistaria tree. The unctuous humor of
Stone's rising inflection when he ex
claims "I'm so ner-vous" is even more
delicious than Lawrence d'Orsay'a

Has an actress the right to accept a
play which promises to be a great suc
cess simply because the role she must
assume requires her to masquerade, in
male attire? Legally, of course, an
actress has a right to refuse any play
that doesn't suit her, but professional
ly is she justified in rejecting a play
because of the trousers?
This interesting ethical problem
doesn't worry Miss Bertha. Galland, for
she has just settled it to her own satis
faction by rejecting: a new play written
especially for her by one of America's
foremost dramatists. It wouldn't be
fair'to name the dramatist, for he has
hopes of getting some other actres3.
not quite so fastidious, to accept his
trousers play. But the fact remains
that this play, which had already been
tentatively accepted by Manager J.
Fred Zimmerman has been voted a
success, was rejected when Miss Gal
land read the play because the actress
refused to wear the trousers.
"I never have and I never will," said
Miss Galland, "and I don't care if it is
the best play ever written, I won't use
it. So there, now."
Henrietta Crosman won her first big
success In a trousers part, and Julia
Marlowe did not scorn the pants in
"When Knighthood Was in Flower."
Lulu Glaser has even decided to wear
trousers in the operatic version of the
same novel, to be called "A Madcap

fused to wear trousers' once for
Anthony Hope's play, "Phroso." Since
eminent examples on both sidesâ or

the Hotel Cecil. Later he intends to
go to Scotland and make a tour of that
country, starting from Edinburgh.
Mr. Chapiri Is sufficiently recovered to
have gone to, his own home in Sacra

has a beautiful home awaiting: his
bride.
The wedding of Miss Stella McCalla
and William Wallace Chapin, which
was to have been celebrated at Mare
Island on August 3, has been postponed
owing to Mr. Chapin's recent illness.
The wedding will probably be an early
fall affair. i
Miss Ruth Gedney, who passed the
early part of the season at Red Bluff,
is spending the month in San Fran

Next comes its domestic value. Now
it might seem strange to declare for
the auto as a preserver of domestic
harmony, but a close observation of
the doings of the smart set this sum
mer shows conclusively that madame
and her dainty daughter have not, as
in seasons past, gone for an extended
visit to the smart resorts, whereat to
see and be seen, and Incidentally
snatch a few real pleasures, but they
have taken a "run" to Del Monte or
Tahoe or Santa Cruz or wherever their
fancy takes them. Just for a short
stay. That concludes their separation
from the head of the household, he,
poor devil, who hitherto has stayed
at his desk all through the summer,
taking his meals at the restaurant or
club, where he's mighty likely to Im
bibe tastes not quite compatible with
domestic loyalty and future felicity.
The auto, the evolved product of a
volatile French brain. Is fast becoming
an essential In urban life wherever
cities grow. It has proved a source of
renewed acquaintanceship with na
ture; and how far we have strayed,
vre cramped and crabbed city dwellers,
we* scarcely know until we have faxed
forth from the din and dust into the
heart of the countryside to breathe
the air that carries in each molecule
the essential element of life. Ah!
that Is the Joy of the auto, the in

accelerated action of the brain and
all its senses. Here is its greatest
boon to man. Its energizing power to
mind and body.
What a merry band went down to
the Korea on Tuesday to bid "bon voy

And. by the way, isn't it execrable

SHERIFF AND STRIKERS FIGHT.
Lively Encounter at the Swift Plant
In South. St. Paul.
ST. PAUL, July 16. â The first clash
between the Sheriffs force and the
striking butchers of Swift & Co. at
South St. Paul occurred to-day, when
a spirited and partly successful effort
was made by ' the company, assisted
by Sheriff Grisim and deputies, to
force about twenty-five men. through
a big crowd of strikers who were con
gregated about the entrance to the
packing-house yards. A severe hand
to-hand encounter ensued and several
men on both sides were badly bruised.
One of the strikers, J. K. Banks, mar
shal of the striking pickets, was ar
rested later and fined $25.
; The clash 'occurred after Sheriff
Grisim had held a conference with
Governor Van Sant on r the strike sit
uation, during, which the Governor in
structed Grisim to use his utmost en
de'avors to disperse the large gather
ing of strikers who, since the strike
began, '. . have ; congregated , about the
entrance to the packing-house yards

SHERIDAN, Wyo., July 16.âGarri
son life at Fort Mackenzie appears not
to be very attractive, for desertions
there are of almost daily occurrence.
It is reported that on the July pay day
seven soldiers took their departure from
the fort and have never been heard
from, since, and the desertions for this
month, it is said, will amount to at
least twenty. Most of the soldiers who
desert, it Is said, are recruits, who have
been in the service but a few months.

Prior to this time the strikers had in
dulged in no violence.
When the Sheriff went to South St.
Paul after his conference with the
Governor he held a conference with
Superintendent Burns of the Swift
Packing Company. The latter ex
pressed a desire to take a number of
men into t the yards and plans were
made.
The invaders, when they marched
up I to . the entrance, were surrounded
by strikers and a fight began. In a mo
ment all was confusion. ' Major Turtle
of the Minneapolis branch of the com
pany, who was with the invaders, waa
badly injured. Sheriff Grlsim rescued
him from, the strikers, who were
pounding him. . .The fighting line
stretched over a hundred yards. While
the fight was going on ten men ran the
blockade of the pickets and several
others managed to slip through by
themselves. It is claimed that in this
manner twenty-five men were taken
into the yards.
After the fight Sheriff Grlsim called
the strike leaders and the pickets to
gether and issued a forceful statement
of the situation. He declared that if
the strikers persisted in their course of
blockading the public thoroughfare he
would be compelled to call upon the
Governor for aid. The Sheriffs state
ments were met with long arguments
and protestations that the law was be
ing observed.
Sheriff Grisim ordered the abandon
ment of the cordon of pickets. The
men assented, but as soon as he left
the scene the cordon was again formed
on orders from the business agent of
the union and the work of holding up
every man attempting to pass went on.
Nothing will be done at the plant to
morrow. The men will be kept within
its walls.
On Monday an effort will be made,
backed, up _by the full resources of
the Swift Company, to open the plant
with a large force and keep it in oper
ation. Serious trouble is expected.

reports from St. Petersburg that the
Japanese lost 30,000 men in a" battle
near Port Arthur on July 10 or 11.
Not a shot was fired on either date.
PARIS. July 17.â Light is breaking
at last upon the situation at Port
Arthur and the land operations on
Liaotung Peninsula since the first of
the month. The official denial from
Tokio of the report that 30,000 Japan
ese were killed or wounded in a battle
on July 10 or 11 is accepted here as
final proof of the falsity of the rumor,
which at the outset was received with
credulity.
But, while this tale of Japanese dis
aster proves to have been without
foundation, details are being received
of two^ severe reverses which the Jap
anese suffered on the land side of Port
Arthur during the present month, re
ports of. which, heretofore were ex
tremely vague. It is probable that the
account of the loss of 30,000 Japanese
was but an exaggerated version of the
last of these two engagements.

The question of arbitration was, first
taken up and after a prolonged discus
sion the representatives of the union
agreed to waive the ground . they had
taken when they insisted that the arbi
tration should mean only an advance in
wages. They agreed to accept the de
mand of the packers that the decision
of the arbitrators '.cover the
entire scopeJj 4,f ", the strike and its
causes.' l J^/ / j -"
\ The quesfficn Of taking back the men
who had gone^'jout on strike was then
considered. Donnelly insisted that all
the men should be] taken back pending
the arbitration. The packers insisted
that the men be taken back In the or
der in which they applied for Work and
that as many of them would~be given
places as the packers could find room
for. j ' The 3 packers declared that they
would i\ot discharge the men they em
ployed. ] Donnelly asked that the pack
ers agree to reinstate 'the old men
within a week and the packers refused
to make the agreement. * This final an
swer" broke oft negotiations, and the
representatives of the union left the
meeting. ' ' â¢ Â»
Working conditions at the local yarda
were improved ; further to-day. More
than 200 more men were at work and
distributed through the various plants.
At Armour's plant- more than 1000 hogs

At Morris ;& Co.'s : twenty-five more
butchers were at work than yesterday
and 450 hogs were killed during the
day. j At Swift's the operations were
increased considerably. ' T. F. Swift
said to-night: ' . -;v
*.., "The local market has suffered noth
ing because of this strike. Thus far the
country,at large is being supplied with

ceptions, the prices remain just as they
were; before the strike.*' -
A -mass meeting of the trades unions
allied with the meat cutters and
butchers was held at the stock yards
- It w-as announced to-night by mem
bers of the firemen's' union that they

of their own they declare, and they
don't wish to work with the non-union
men that have- been placed Â¦ in the
plants since the strike.
to-night to discuss the advisability of
going on a sympathetic strike. Twen
ty-two unions were represented, with
a total membership of 12,000 men. Of
these unions nineteen came to the meet
ing with instructions to strike if the
meat cutters and butcHers asked them
to do so.

them to remain at work until after the
return of President â¢ Donnelly to the
city on Monday,, the union leader hav
ing left the city to-nleht to visit St.

Perdicaris frankly says that Gum
mere, the American Consul, and the
British Minister at Tangier are
strongly opposed to giving Raissouli
any authority.\
"I know this will excite surprise,"
said he, "as the public has the idea
that Raissouli is ' a common robber.
This is entirely erroneous. I consider
Raissouli to be the strongest man now
available to deal with the situation.
While it would be an experiment, yet
I am convinced that it would be better
to try the experiment than to allow
the situation to drift Into complete an
archy. Raissouli says he can maintain
order, and I believe in giving him a
trial." %4'; -v^'-:
"The warships , might better be at
Tangier than at Toulon. In case of a
rising it would be over before the ships
arrive. It would also be impossible
to get a British military force from
Gibraltar across in time. Moreover, I
stopped at Gibraltar on my way here
and the Military Governor said he had
no orders contemplating a Gibraltar
relief force going to Tangier on an
emergency."
Perdicaris says he fully recognizes
the difficulties in the way of France
adopting force, owing to Parliament
ary opposition and political complica
tions in Spain and Morocco. There
fore, he is prepared to propose an al
ternative measure. This is nothing
short of giving Raissouli authority to
deal with the situation in Tangier.
"The situation at Tangier has/ be
come desperate," said Perdicaris.
"Strong measures ere requisite to
avoid serious consequences. France's
policy of pacific penetration promises
to be entirely inadequate to meet the
danger. The present plan of sending
forty French Algerian officers to Tan
gier to bolster up the police is likely
to bring on the very catastrophe
France seeks to avoid. It will excite
intense animosity, .and if an outbreak
occurs these,- forty -. officers would be
useless to maintain, order, if, "however,
a large force â say of 10,000 , menâ is
landed, it would end the disturbance
and, give a lasting object .lesson fot
French power. It might involveC-a
skirmish and possibly some bloodshed,
but it would be insignificant compared
with. the. grave menace of "an extensive
rising and possible massacre," through
a policy^ of. excessive mildness."
s It was .suggested to Perdicaris that
two French warships were now held
at Toulon in; readiness to meet the
emergency of- an uprising at Tangier.
He replied: .
PARIS, July 16.â Ion Perdicaris ar
rived here to-day from Tangier on an
important mission, which will occupy
the next two weeks. He called at the
American embassy, lengthily conferred
with Embassador Porter and also ar

CRANK DRAWS CHECK
FOR NEARLY A BILLION
BERLIN, July 16.â A trial which the
Prussian authorities began July 12 at
Koenigsberg, at the instance of the
Russian Government, against seven So
cial Democrats accused of smuggling
anarchistic literature into Russia, at
tracts very great attention.
The Prussian police claim to have as
certained that there existed a system
for circulation of documents through
agents in the border towns. The pro
ceedings, which hitherto had been rath
er tame, reached a sensational stage
to-day in the testimony of M. von
Wymodeze. the Russian Consul General
at Koenigsberg, who said the police
brought him over twenty-five seized
pamphlets, asking him to speedily ex
amine them. Of, this number the Con
sul General read only one, marking
objectionable sentences.
Herr Llebknecht, one of the counsel
for the defense, asked ,M. von Wymo
deze to point out the . inflammatory
sentences that had been quoted in the
pamphlet by the ministers in the Reich,
stag and Diet debates, but M. Wymo
deze was unable to c^o so. Herr Lieb
knecht continues:
"Where is the sentence, 'Nothing can
save the throne of Nicholas II from the
fate of Alexander II from bloody
vengeance'? I find nothing in the whole
pamphlet to that effect."
M. von Wymodeze claimed that the
imperfections in the translation were
due to the hurry in which he made it.
Herr Llebknecht declared that the
hurry wajj biased and due to a wish
to Insert blood curdling phrases which
were not in the original.
The presiding Judge thereupon came
to the defense of M. von Wymo
deze, saying the sentences were In the
other pamphlets. To this Herr Lleb
knecht rejoined: > ./
"This garbled translation gave the
Imperial Chancellor and other Minis
ters the occasion to make the gravest
charges against the Social Democracy.
It was precisely the above sentence
which played the most prominent role
in the public discussion. â¢ *
The Judge did not permit Herr Lieb
knecht to make any further remarks
on this line and excused M. von
Wymodeze for the errors in translation
of the pamphlet on account of brief
time he devoted to the work.
Counsel Schwartz expressed astonish
ment at the brief time permitted to M.
von Wymodeze to arrange words Chat
were not connected with the pamphlet. 7
The Judge again, in a sharp tone, re
plied that this was an insinuation that
the additions were purposely made.
The trial will continue for at least
ten days.

ADEN, July 16. â The North Ger
man Lloyd steamship Prinz Helnrich,
which has arrived here from Ham
burg, June 23, and Southampton, June
28, for Yokohama, reports that she
was stopped yesterday afternoon by
the Russian volunteer fleet steamship
Smolensk and compelled to give up
thirty-one sacks of letters and twenty
four sacks of boxes and parcels, all
bound for Japan.
It is reported that the Peninsular
and Oriental Company steamship
Malasia, from Antwerp for Japan, has
been seized in the Red Sea by the
Russian volunteer fleet ship St. Peters
burg.
BERLIN, July 16. â The Foreign
Office here confirms the report of the
seizure of the mails on a German
Lloyd steamship by the Russian vol
unteer fleet steamship Smolensk in the
Red Sea, but declines to discuss the
political features of the case at this
stage and does not indicate what steps
it intends to take. The news reached
here too late for most of the evening
papers to comment upon it. The Tage

LONDON, July 16.â No attempt is be

the Russian Government was informed
that the Foreign Office understood the

As a matter of fact, it is,learned that

TATCHEKIAO REPORT DOUBTED.
ST. PETERSBURG. July 16.âReli
able reports from Tatchekiao this aft
ernoon brought the announcement of
the presence of Russian warships off
Kaichou, which they were said to be
bombarding, and the arrival of Jap
anese transports and torpedo-boats off
the port of Newchwang. The Admiralty
Â¦was unable to confirm or deny either
report, not having reclved any com
munication from Rear Admiral
Wlthoeft; but the admirals generally
were not inclined to credit them. If
true it would mean that Admiral
"Withoeft has got the Japanese trans
ports at his mercy. In this case Ad
miral Togo would hasten to their res
cue and engage the Russians. This
also may explain the absence of posi
tive news of the Japanese occupation
of the port of Newchwang and the cau
tious advance of General Oku's col
umn.
Tfco Foreign Office has received a tel
esram from Russian Consul Gross at
Newrhwang. dated July 14, but he did
not mention the approach of the Jap
anese.
According to reports from the vi
cinity of the LJao River a disguised
Japanese officer and a detachment of
Japanese have gone toward Halcheng
with ten chests of silver to pay Chi
nese bandits.
OKU'S FLANKING MOVEMENT.
The main body of General Oku's
force seems to be swinging around the
Russian left, after having combined
with General Nodzu's army. The Jap
anese are also moving up the coast
on thÂ« Russian right. An artillery
reconnolssance has showed the country
directly south to be clear of the
enemy.
TATCHEKIAO. July 16.â There is
reason to believe that the whole or
part of the Port Arthur squadron has
come north Into the Gulf of Liaotung.
The sound of the firing of heavy guns
is heard seaward. Warships are dis
tinguishable, firing In the direction of
Kaichou. It is surmised that they
could be only Russian vessels.

pear to be taking extra precautions in
the case of Tatchekiao, because they
know that General Kuropatkin is there
in person.
According to a dispatch from Lieur
tenant General Sakharoff, dated July
la and given out to-day, the wings of
Generals Oku's and Nodzu's armies
have joined at Tangchi, ten miles
southeast of Tatchekiao. The Japanese
also are reported to have occupied the
fortifications at Pintzsau, about seven
miles north of Kaichou, and were still
proceeding toward Newchwang, which
had not been occupied on July 15. A
detachment of General Kuroki's force
is reporteoVto have reached the village
of Tszhakehe, forty miles east of Llao
yang, on the Fengwangchew high
road.
Continued From Page 21, Column 8.
While it is conceivable that the Jap
anese themselves may have spread
the report for the purpose of leading
General Kuropatkin to believe that
they will not advance any farther in
Manchuria, the general staff is not dis
posed to regard them as guilty of such
Machlavelism. Despite the attitude of
the general staff, the public ardor has
quite cooled down. â¢
"On July 9 the Japanese suspended
their advance and Intrenched them
selves in the positions they are occu
pying. Daily exchanges of rifle fires
are Impeding their work."
i Since the receipt from Tokio of an
official denial of the report of a Jap
anese repulse at Port Arthur, with the
loss of 30,000 men, skepticism as to
the truth of the report from Viceroy
Alexieff's headquarters has pervaded
all circles.
Japanese effected a landing at Port
Dalny on July 2, disembarking about
20,000 men and fifty guns. The whole

OF INTEREST TO PEOPLE
OF THE PACIFIC COAST
It appears that the Dominion De
partment of the Interior, through one
of its assistants, has been sending
broadcast throughout the northwestern
stations circular letters, principally ad
dressed to clergymen, professional men
and persons of influence," describing in
glowing terms the splendid resources
of the Canadian Northwest and invit
ing immigrants by the offer of 160 acres
of land for each, free schools and sound
laws. Attention Is especially invited
to the extent of these facilities.
There can be n<j .objection to such
efforts on the part of private immigra
tion agencies, but when, as in this case,
the Government Itself seeks to attract
citizens of other countries, the matter
is one which calls for official remon
strance. .
WASHINGTON, July 16.â It Is prob
able that the attention of the British
Government will be directed to a move
ment conducted officially by the Cana-;
dlan Government to induce immigration
from the United States to the North
west Territory.
Official Efforts of the Dominion May
Xot Be Approved by
England.
CAXADA ENDEAVORING
TO ATTRACT SETTLERS
ly relations be maintained between the
two countries. There is no intention of
taking any action which might cause a
change of attitude on the part of the
British which has been regarded up to
this time as officially correct. In this
connection it is stated there is
ho expectation of any serious
question arising from the operations
from Russian auxiliary cruisers in the
Red Sea," although it is known that the
British Government has deemed the
action of St. Petersburg in hold-
Ing ud British merchantmen as suffU
cent to warrant inquiries being made
both at St. Petersburg and Constanti
nople.
Foreign Secretary Lansdowne, In
talks with the European Embassadors
has stated in a way to admit of no
doubt that , the British Government
would not permit a violation of the
treaty of Berlin, in respect to the clos
ure of the Straits of the Dardanelles
to warships. On the other hand Rus
sia has .stated in equally emphatic
terms that she has no intention of dis
patching any war vessels through the
straits, and diplomats familiar with
the situation in the Balkans say that
while they do not believe there is dan
ger of international trouble there, Rus
sia's own interests demand the pres
ence in the Black Sea of the whole of
the fleet now there.
The Turkish Embassy says it does
not know of any application on j the
part of Russia for permission to war
ships to so out and insists that Tur
key cannot be held responsible for the
passage of the Dardanelles by unarmed
merchant steamers, and that if guns
are placed on board of, them outside
the Turkish waters that Is no con
cern of the Turkish Government.

Missionary Craft Pases Ships of War
in the Red Sea.
ISLAND OF PERIM, Straits of Bab
el Mandeb, July 16. â The American
missionary vessel Morning Star, from
Boston, arrived here to-day and re
ports that yesterday she passed, be
tween Jebel Teir and Jebel Zugur
Islands, in the Red Sea, a Russian
volunteer fleet steamship, flying the
naval flag, bound northward. The
Morning Star sighted at dusk off Jebel
Zugur, another cruiser, with three fun
nels and two masts, and at midnight
she sighted a torpedo-boat. These lat
ter vessel3.were supposed to be cruis
ing. .
which {the latter had captured toward
the end of June. On July 10, after sev
eral ~ vessels;-; of the Port Arthur fleet
had steamed out to the assistance of
the garrison and shelled the Japanese
works for two hours, the Russians
made a gallant baydnet charge and
carried the positions, the Japan'ese re
treating 'in disorder; .Details of the
losses in this second engagement. have
not been, received, but according to
the accounts- of the .two , days' bat
tle the Japanese suffered very heavily
during the ' demoralization following
the Russian" charge.
As a result of these two victories the
defenders of Port Arthur hold the same
positions they occupied a month ago,
and the Japanese attempt to take the
stronghold has thus far ended only In
disaster.
ALEXIEF REPORTS VICTORY.
ST. PETERSBURG, July 16.â In the
fighting July 3 and 4 for the pos
session of the positions at Lunsantan,
outside of Port Arthur, Viceroy Alexleff
reports, the Japanese were repulsed
with the aid of the protected cruiser
Novik and a number of gunboats and
torpedo boats. The Russians captured
a number of Japanese fortifications.
The losses Qf the Russians were two
officers and thirty-five men killed and
four officers and 247 men "wounded. The
Chinese estimate the Japanese losses
at 2000. The following is the' text of
Viceroy Alexieff's report:
"According to reports received from
Port Arthur, dated July 5, an engage
ment occurred on July 3 and 4 on
the right flank of our line of defence,
for the possession of the positions of
Lunsantan. . Toward evening th&
enemy was repulsed and many of the
Japanese fortifications fell into our
hands. During these two days the
Novik, with gunboats and torpedo
boats, put out to ; sea and bombarded
the enemy, thus j contributing to our
general success.
"Our losses for the two days' fight
ing were: Killed, Captain Khetenko,
of the Thirteenth Regiment, and Lieu
tenant Livotoff of the Twenty-seventh
Regiment; wounded, Captain Mlro
schnikoff of the Thirteenth Regiment,
Lieutenant Olschinevsky of the Thir
teenth Regiment, Sub-Lieutenant Dem
ianoff of the Fifteenth Regiment and
Prince Gantimouroff, aid-de-camp of
General Stoessel, dangerously wound
ed. Thirty-five of our soldiers were
killed and 247 were wounded. Colonel
Reuss, who acted as chief of staff of
General Stoessel, was bruised.
"The Japanese losses for the two days,
according to Chinese reports, were 2000
men killed.
- BATTLE OF JULY 7.
"According to a report of July 7
we captured on July 6 an advanced
hill, insuring us possession of Lunsan
tan Pass. Our loss was two officers
killed and one officer wounded and
twenty-one soldiers wounded.
"According to advices received, the

Cruiser Said to Have Joined the Vladi

, ST. PETERSBURG, July ljB.â There
is a persistent rumor In. Circulation
to the effect that the protected' cruiser
Novik has joined the Vladivostok
squadron. The Admiralty has no in
formation on the subject. It is ad
mitted that it is possible, but im
probable, in view of the inadvisability
of separating the Port Arthur forces.

plar la September will be shared
by the wives, daughters and sisters of
Ca'ii fornia Templars. The work has
been undertaken, with a hearty good
will and a determination that nothing
shail be omitted In the entertaining of
the visitors and the reputation of the
State for hospitality shall be upheld.
â¢ The ladies have held many meetings
in crdfr to perfect their plans; have
appointed officers and subcommittees
and outlined a programme in all its
detail, that nothing shall be' omitted in
entertaining the visitors from the time
they enter the Golden Gate until their
parting. Mrs. J. W. Burnham is chair
man of the committee. She is ably
assisted by Miss Henrietta Stadtmuller,
the efficient secretary, and a corps of
ladies from San Francisco, Oakland,
Alameda, Berkeley, Sacramento, Santa
Cruz, San Jose and other towns and
cities in California, all experienced in
entertaining visitors. To them has- Just
been assigned the duty to look after
the comfort of the ladies who will ac
company the Slr^ Knights on their
western pilgrimage.
DAILY RECEPTIONS.
A committee of ladies will be at the
depot, assisting the reception commit-
tee in receiving commanderies, delega- !
tlons and Sir Knights coming unat- '
tached who bring their families. Dele- '
gatlons will be in attendance at the
j principal hotels to receive the visiting
ladles upon arrival and look to their ;
j comfort. They will also superintend
j the decorations at the headquarters at
the Palace Hotel, where three large
parlors and fourteen suites of rooms
have been reserved for the Grand Com
mandery of California, the Grand En- i
campment of the United States and the
officers of the Great Priory of England
and Wales, who come to represent
King Edward at the conclave.
The ladles will entertain at the Pal
ace Hotel every afternoon and even
ing during conclave week. On Monday
evening the reception to visiting Sir
Knights will be informal; on Tuesday
evening a reception will be given to the '
grand master of the United States and
other distinguished guests. Wednesday

be given to tfie Sir Knights, the ladies
will make it a ladles' night and enter
tain the ladies coming with visiting Sir Â¦
j Knights to this city, while their es- j
i corts will be at the banquet. The mu- â¢
sical programme for the whole week is
to be of exceptional merit and attrac- ]
tion, for which the best talent in Cali
fornia is to be engaged.
SOUVENIRS FOR GUESTS?
Stockton Commandery No. 8, one of ;
the oldest and most loyal in the Cali- !
fornia jurisdiction, is making exten- :
-sive preparations to attend the coming'
conclave. The commandery will come
from Stockton by special train on
Monday, September 5, and will be ac
companied by several hundred mem
bers, their families and friends. Joint
ly with Naval Commandery No. '19 of
Vallejo, headquarters have been se
cured for conclave week at Lyric Hall,
on Eddy street, where the two com
manderies will keep open house and
dispense hospitality without stint.
Stockton is situated In the fruit belt
of the famous San Joaquin Valley, and
the Sir Knights, proud of the products
of their home, will regale .the visiting
Sir Knights and their friends with
samples of the luscious fruits fresh
from their own orchards and vine
yards. . Small bottles of wine will be
given to each visitor as a souvenir of
San Joaquin. The sample is to be
from the grapes grown in the valley.
The commandery will bring a supply
of ribbon badges, to be exchanged
with those of visiting Sir Knights. The
design of the exchange badge is to be
distinctive of Stockton and its vicinity.
In, the background Mount Diablo will
be visible as It appears from Stockton.
In the foreground will be a view of the
head of Stockton 'Channel, with let
tering appropriate to the purpose and
the occasion. Stockton Commandery
expects to have about 125 Sir Knights
in line of the great parade on Mon
day, September 5, and Naval Com
mandery will not be / much behind

Jcbn Sroufe, the well known mer

his home at 11C0 Page street. He con

ago and the illness resulted fatally.
The deceased was a pioneer resident
of this State. He crossed the plains In
1850 from his native State, Ohio. With
his young wife he made the arduous
Journey in a prairie schooner.
He started in business in San Fran-
Cisco In 1870. By industry and integ

of friends. He was well liked because
of fcis straightforward business meth

A wife and four daughters survive

The week has offered material for
comparison in banking conditions in
the publication of the Controller's com
pilation of national bank reports
of June 9 and the semi-annual reports
of New York trust, companies. It Is
found that the national bank reserves
are well maintained, notwithstanding
the year's heavy expansion, the excess
resei"ves over the amount legally re
quired standing on June 9, this year,
at $104,912,925, as compared with $66,
r.07,725 a year before. But while the ex
cess reserves last year by the reserve
cities stood at only $19,235,067. they have
risen this year to $52,S77,S32; and last
year's holdings by the country banks,
which stood at $47,072,C58, have only in
creased to $52,fS5,043. In other words,
a much larger proportion of the coun
try's reserve is in the reserve cities,
where it figures as reserve against both
the depositing banks' obligations and
those from the holding bank. In the
case of the New York trust companies
there was an increase of cash of $41,
000,000 for the year, but the proportion
of the increase in cash which is kept
on deposit with New York banks, as
indicated by those companies whose re
ports specify that point, usually over
60 per cent, these deposits also figuring
in the cash reserves of the New York
banks. This heavy increase in the
ultimate reserve obligations of the
country in the reserve banks, especial
ly New York banks, goes to explain ths
conservatism which has marked the
loan market in spite of the apparent
plethora of money in New York.
Bonds were irregular at times, but
were generally firm. United States 3s
declined *4 and the new 4s coupon 1-8
per cent en call during the week.
BANK CONDITIONS GOOD.
The expectation of the handing
down of the Northern Securities de
cision was an influence which culmin
ated when it was announced. The se
riousness of the view taken of the
damage -to the winter wheat crop ul
timately commanded attention and ag
gravated the pressure to take profits
in the grain carrying railroads. Even
the stress laid upon the prospects in
other crops served to offset to some
extent any anxieties over the wheat
crop. The real importance to our fin
ancial resources of the amount or sur
plus wheat we may have for export
commands attention by reason of the
showing of the foreign trade fpr the
year. ; :
Out of the last year's crop of 633.000,
000 bushels, the fiscal year's reports have
reached only 44,000.000 bushels, and the
June exports of wheat fell to the nom
inal figure of 458,000 bushels. Princi
pally as a result of the conditions in
the wheat trade the value of domestic
exports for the fiscal year decreased
more than $7,000,000 from those of the
previous year, and only the large in
crease in the value of cotton exports
redeemed the year's showing. Whether
the rate of increase in our consump
tion has thus affected the volume of
our exported surplus, a new factor in
the country's money affairs would be
indicated were this condition found to
be continued in the coming fiscal year.
the preceding upward movement and
when the occasional reactions do not
extend to the depth touched on the
preceding downward movement. This
has been the record of the successive
movements since the recovery set in
from the low level of the period of
liquidation which was touched in the
fall of last year.
The course of the market during the
last two weeks has had the effect of
driving in a large outstanding short
interest which has maintained its po
sition there with a number of ad
vances on the assumption that a pro*
longed period of depression and con
traction was to be faced. The active
and organized campaign for the rise
was undertaken with a knowledge of
this outstanding short Interest and
with a purpose to profit by Its nec
essities at. the higher level of prices.
But the success of the campaign is
none the less evidence of the sold out
Interest which has been reached and
the hopeful feeling, tempered by some
remaining uncertainties, to which
speculative sentiment had attained.
EXPORTS SHOW DECREASE.
The week's stock market has shown
an improvement and variety and
while the movement of prices has been
constantly irregular the market has
shown a good absorptive power and
has taken well a large amount of
speculative profit taking, which leaves
it in a strong position technically if
kept free from unpropitious condi
tions, which would induce fresh li
quidation. The action of the market
has had a notably encouraging effect
on speculative sentiment and has had
an important influence in shaping a
hopeful feeling over future develop
ments. The undertone of confidence
has been so marked thata disposition
was manifest to ignore happenings
that would have sent a chill through
the stock community a few weeks
ago, such as the reports of damage to
the winter wheat crop, the meat pack
ers' strike and some minor occur
rences.
The' volume of dealings reached a
total again in excess of those of the
largest day's business last week and
the average price level reached
was the highest of the year and
since the low level reached last
year. It is accepted as evidence of
stable conditions in the market when
the occasional recoveries in prices do
not short of the level touched on

STOCKS IMPROVING.
Revised opinions over the Northern
Securities opinion were that the ex
isting conditions had been little al
tered by it. ; The most important fea
ture of strength in the market was
United States Steel preferred, its two
point rise having an important senti
mental effect on the whole market,
but without explanation in any new
developments. The advance in St.
Paul was an index of the reaction
from excessive alarm over the dam
age-to the wheat crop. The advance
in that stock and in the Eries may
also be attributed to the recognition by
the professional element that they had
not yet enjoyed an advance commen
surate with that which has occurred
in other ~>rts of the list and so offered
an inviting field for fresh operations.
The sustaining effect was taken ad
vantage of to pursue profit taking in
other parts of the list- The bank
statement stimulated the market
anew. All of the expected gain in
cash was reported, bringing the re-,

fourth street. Oakland. Mrs. Rivest suf-
fered many years with rheumatism. Fi-
nally the left knee became stiffened,
swollen and painful, and at last the left
leg became paralyzed. The home physi-
cian feared gangrene at the knee and
advised amputation of the leg, Mrs.
Rivest objected to amputation and on ad-
vice from a friend she had her relatives
take her to the Electro-Chemic Institute.
14 S Grant avenue. San Francisco. The
Electro-Chemic treatment cured Mrs.
Rivest quickly. There was no cutting.
There was no pain. In a short time sha
threw away her crutches. Her left leg
is now as good as the other and Electro-
chemistry did the work when all other
treatments had failed. Should any one
interested doubt the whole truth of this
most wonderful cure they should go and
see the happy, cured patient. She would
be only too glad to vouch for its truth.
The Electro-Chemic cures of Cancer. Tu-
mors, Consumption. Catarrh, Asthma.
Bronchitis. Deafness, Ringing: Ears,
Rheumatism. Paralysis. Locomotor
Ataxia. Neuralgia, Dyspepsia. Liver
Trouble. Kidney and Bladder Troubfes,
Piles, Fistula. Constipation, Headache.
Dizziness. Insomnia. Epilepsy, Stricture.
Prostatitls, Blood Poison, Female Irreg-
ularities and Misplacements, etc.. etc.,
are Just as wonderful as the cure of Mrs.
Rivest. and upon application the testi-
monials of hundreds of cured patients
living right here in San Francisco will
be cheerfully given. These wonderful
cures are quick, permanent and inexpen-
sive, and, no matter how many other
treatments have failed, Electro-Chemis-
try would in all probability prove cura-
tive. The Electro-Chemic X-ray exami-
nation is the most reliable examination
that any sufferer can have. Such an ex-
amination will quickly show whether a
case is curable or not. and this examina-
tion is now absolutely free to any suf-
ferer applying at the Institute for it.
Don't mistake the place. The success
of the Electro-Chemic practice has
caused other physicians to try to imitate
it. -The Electro-Chemic Institute occupies
nearly the whole first floor of the large
building. 118 Grant avenue, corner of
I Post street. The office hours are from 9
j to 5 and 7 to 8 daily and from 10 to Ion
Sundays. Consultation, examination and;"
advice are free to all. and patients living
at a distance are furnished a home treat-
ment that is most successful and are
loaned, free of charge until cured, a
complete Electro-Chemic apparatus.
From a wide experience, the physicians
of the Electro-Chemic Institute have
learned that the very best advertising
comes from patients who have been
quickly, thoroughly and cheaply cured,
and while Mrs. Rivest only paid a fÂ»w
dollars for her wonderful cure, she has
been the means of sending many other
sufferers to the Institute for treatment.

Yoell's life while practicing *at the
bar at Sari Jose was tumultuous to
a degree. He had personal controver
sies with William Matthews. C. C.
Stevens and Judge A. L. Rhodes, at
the latter of whom he fired a pistol
shot. With Judge Joseph Johnson ho
had so fierce a controversy in court
that the Judge adjourned court In or
der to engage Yoell with a bowie knife.
*I tys h you to act at once and take
out special letters of administration
until the will is probated, so that my
wishes regarding the disposition of j
the property will be carried but."
Settling in tho Santa Clara Valley mj
3S55, J. Alexander Yoell began the'
practice of law and in 1S5S married. In
the early *60's his young wife left him,
takinq: with her two of the three chil
dren born of their union. In due
course Yoell procured a divorce from
his wife in the courts of Santa Clara
County Â«>n the ground of desertion ;
find shortly afterward married Miss j
J'mily C Center, who had been em
ployed in the Yoell family as a dress
maker. Seven children were born of
th's spcon<l marriage. After ten years j
they quarreled and entered into arti
cles of separation, Yoell making an al
lowance of $300 a month to his wife
and settling upon her In remainder
property to the value of $150,000, reserv
ing frÂ«r himself a life Interest. The
children, while taking little part In the
domestic troubles, in the main sided :
vith the mother, and Yoell spent the !
last two years of his life in San. Fran- j
cisco with headquarters at Hotel
Pleasanton. Through a life of litiga
tion and quarrels Yoell preserved the
art of making money and keeping it. J
That r:Â«ig:e Yoell feared a dispute
over th<- disposition of his property is
shown by the contents of a letter
â¢which was written on the same day as
the ivill was executed and sealed with
instructions that it be not opened until
after his death. The letter, addressed
to Mrs. Levy, contained the following
sentence:
In anticipation of a possible con
test over his estate application was
made yesterday for special letters of
administration by his eldest daughter,
Evelina A. Levy.. The application was
made through Mrs. Levy's attorney.
Her.ry C. McPike. and after hearing
his argument the letters were granted
and a bond for $25,000 filed;
He mad? a will on January 26 of this
year in which Mrs. Levy was named as
his executor. ,
During his life Yoell's name figured
in many stormy lawsuits. With this
abundance of heirs to his $400,000 es
tate it is certain that his name will
live in the records of the courts though
he be dead.
A Litter contest Is expected over the
estate of J. Alexander Yoell. the
wealthy San Jcse attorney, who died
at Highland Springs on Friday. The
deceased left two families, the first
cont-istingr of three children, the second
of seven children. His first wife is still
alive.

The police are convinced that" anoth
er bloody highbinder war had its com
mencement in Chinatown early yester
day morning when a Suey^ Sing, tong
man fired a shot in Spofford alley at
a. Hop Sing. man. The . bultet went
through the hat of the, intended vic
tim and knocked it off his head.
, Shortly before 3 o'clock Policemen
Reilly and Doran heard the report of
a shot at. Washington street and Spof
ford alley and they ran to the scene.
A Chinese with light trousers was seen
running along Spofford alley and they
started in pursuit. -The' fugutive' ran
into the headquarters or tire Hop Sing
tong on the upper floor of the. premises
at 826# Clay, street.
The policemen found the door barri
caded and they were refused admit
tance. They procured the assistance
of H.M. Smith and M. Reed of Morae's
patrol and when -they; ran round to
Spofford alley to effect an entrance by
the rear they_ saw some Chinese climb
ing down the; fire escape. As soon as
they saw ,the officers they returned to
the room. -The officers succeeded Jn
climbing over a high bannister and
gaining, entrance to a .rovm where

seven Chinese were seated as if noth
ing had happened. Among them was
the Chinese with the light trousers.
They were all placed under arrest and
locked up in the "tanks." George
Downey, a watchman, found a hat with
bullet holes in it at Washington. street
and Spofford alley. *V" ;
Further Investigation showed that
the Chinese with the white trousers
was the man shot at and that the
shooter was seen to disappear through
Church alley. About 11 o'clock a fight
started In a gambling club between
Hop Sins and Suey Sing men and one
of the Hop Sings pulled off the queue
of a Suey Sing man." It Is supposed
that to avenge this insult a Suey Slrig
man fired the shot at the man with the
white trousers, who belongs to the Hop
Sing tong, and that the end is not yet.
The seven Chinese were photographed
and released from custody.
The Hop Sings and Suey Sings met
last. night at the headquarters of the
See Yup Society. The meeting was
ordered by the officials of the. society
in a"n endeavor to settle the difficulty
between the rival highbinder organ
izations. 'The meeting was a brief and
stormy one. The Suey Sings were
willing . to settle the matter and let
the "trouble drop, but the' Hop Sings,
tne "mftat notorious of the highbinder
tongs, flatly refused to accede to any
such an agreement.
T^e Hop Sings asked.no money in
demnity, : as is usually done in such
cases, but declared that they ". would
have five heads, for the. humiliation
that was heaped upon them in * th<
fight in the Waverly place gambling
house - late Friday night. They de

During a brief thunderstorm this
week lightning tore a hole In the Pal
ace of -Agriculture not far away from
the California section. The exhibitors
from the land where even March has
gentle ways did not take kindly when
they first came here to the forked
lightning and rains that made It look
as If there was an opening for a lat
ter-day Noah, but they have become
so inured to these manifestations of
nature by this'time that not one of
them even looked up when the bolt
struck.
Captain W. N. Harris of the Kings
County exhibit is trying to arrange
with the State commission to give
stereopticon- lectures, for which he will
make no charge, in the assembly hall
at the California building. Harri9'
pictures are of a purely agricultural
nature and carry the spectators from
the snowcaps of the Sierras, which
feed the rivers and the canals, to the
corn and alfalfa fields and orchards on
the plains below. Hii lectures, both in
the wording and illustrating, are de
signed for the practical farmer.
R. H. Furlong, chief of the Califor

STORM PLAYS HAVOC.
have buckled down harder than ever
to their work for the general good of
California and it is not likely that they
will allow anything else to disturb
their serenity during the rest of the
exposition. Few bodies of men en
gaged in a common cause ever get the
best results without an occasional ex
plosion. Unbroken peace is likely to
lead to lack of interest and an occa
sional row, while it can never be com
mended, may serve to put ginger Into
affairs, with ultimate benefit to the
State's interest. However, the will pf
the county organization is to step on
the head of anything that looks like
dissension and pull with the State
commissioners to secure the best re
sults for California, . from "San Diego
to Siskiyou," as California statesmen
of the old school are likely to say. and
both San Diego and Siskiyou and all
the space that lies between are repre
sented at the exposition. "One for all
and all for one" is the slogan of the
Californians who are making this
World's Fair campaign for the ad
vancement and prosperity of the

Handsomely illustrated literature
given away at an exposition reaches a
great many more people than those in
to whose hands it first falls. Many of
these take copies of the books simply
because the pictures are pretty, but
they usually take them to their homes,
no telling in what part of America or
the world, and their friends all take a
look at them. By this process one book
or pamphlet may reach a great many
people and an entire edition given out
freely will reach thousands who do not
attend the fair at alL One of the finest
of the books that has yet appeared
here, and doubtless one of the very
finest ever Issued In the State, is that
sent on by Alameda County. It is
eagerly carried away by visitors and
will be taken to many a home fcj- from
California^ there to disseminate light
on the glories of the Golden State and
the favored region it deals with partic
ularly.
WILLS IS COMPLIMENTED.
The book on California, issued by the
State commission, will soon be delivered
here. As the number of copies is not
great It will not be given away pro
miscuously, but will be presented only
to people who evince a particular in
terest in the State. Copies will be kept
at the State building and at the various
exhibits. The articles on forestry, min
ing, agriculture and horticulture will
be reproduced in small pamphlets and
given out to every one who wants them,
the distribution being at the exhibits!
AWAITING LITERATURE.
A rotary mill, three concentrators
and a slag generator are also to form
part of the California outdoor mining
exhibit. Work on the generator h:is
not yet been finished, owing to some
misunderstanding. The entire ex
hibit covers about half an acre. Cal
ifornians wishing to find it may follow
the noise, but if this fails they will
reach it by walking about 600 feÂ«Â»t up
the ravine back of the Palace of
Mines and Metallurgy.
State Commissioners Filcher and
Wiggins gave an Informal reception
last Satuiday night to Governor Par
dop at the State building. Californians
only being invited. The commission
ers gave personal invitations to all the
rtsidents of the Golden State they
could find and a great many attended.
Among the honored guests was the
Very Rev. Carrol! Davis, dean of
Christ Church, the Bishop's cathedral
in St. Louis. Rev. Mr. Davis is one
of the most prominent ministers in
this cky. He graduated with Gover
nor Pardee from the University of Cal
ifornia, class of '79, and the. two have
always been close friends. ' The re
ception was quite successful and the
Governor, as well as the others, had
a very enjoyable time. The chief ex
ecutive will soon be on his way to
help surprise President Roosevelt with
the news that he has- been again nom
inated and will then return to Califor
nia and the chair of state at Sacra
mento.
California will also show, as soon
us the water ccunes, how a hydraulic
giant Is operated. One of these de
stroyers of mountains has been in
stalled in the State's outdoor mining
space near the mill. It has a three
inch nozzle. There is no mountain
for it to pulverize, but a stream will
be thrown TOO feet from it against a
bulkhead. One of the features of this
exhibit will be a demonstration of how
easily one man can handle the pow
erful giant, turning it In any direction
with perfect ease, controlling it with
the use cf one hand.

KIXGSBRIDGE, Devonshire, July
16. â The body of F. Kent Loomis, who
disappeared from the North German
Lloyd steamer Kaiser Wilhelm II on
June 20 as that vessel was nearing
Plymouth, was found this morning at
Warren Point, adjacent to Thurlstone
Sands, Big Bury Bay, some fifteen
miles from Plymouth, by a laborer,
Thomas Snowden. It was dressed in a
pray overcoat, dark blue suit and
while shirt-
Snowden at once informed the police
and neighbors. When the body was
searched a gold watch, a quantity of
American and English money in notes
and coins were found in the pockets of
the deceased and also a card with the
riiime '"F. Kent Loom:?." The pockets
also contained a number of private pa
jfrs. These, together with the valu
ables, the police took charge of. and
the body was removed and placed In a
farm building at Thurlstonc village to
await the inquest, which will be held
July 18, pending which, and according
to the red tape of the English police
methods, it may be impossible to se
cure a definite announcement of the
identification of the body.
It was late to-day indeed before the"
significance of the discovery was
grasped by the authorities of Kings-
Mtfgegtbe nearest town, but this even
ins Um police of Thurlstone said there
vas no doubt that the body was that
of Loomis. The features were par
tially recognisable from the descrip
tion, but there was no one on the spot
until a late hour who could positively
identfy the remain?. The American
Consul at Plymouth was notified this
afternoon and he ut once proceeded to
Thurlstone for the purpose of making
an official identification. After view
ing the body to-night the Consul said
he had ro doubt it was that of Loomis.
The police, however, refused to allow
the Consul to examine the papers
found on the body. The papers had
been sealed up and the Consul was in
formed that he must obtain permis
sion of the Coroner to inspect them.
Up to a late ho'ur to-night the permis
sion had not been secured. All the
valuables found on the body have also
been sealed up. Including:* the rln^
which was found on the finger, and
which is said to be inscribed inside
with the name of Loomis' wife.
The American Consul has arranged
that proper care be taken of the body.
In an Interview the Consul said that
there rvas an abrasion under the right
ear. There were no important papers
on the ' body and the watch had
Flopped at 6 o'clock. It will be re
membpred that the steamer from
which Loomis disappeared arri\-ed at
Plymouth at 2 o-clock in the morning.

Proper Food Put Him Right.
The food experience of a physician in
his own case when worn and weak
from sickness and when needing nour-
ishment the worst way is valuable:
"An ettack of grip so severe It came
near making an end of me left my
Btomach In such a condition I could not
retain ar.y ordinary food. I knew of
course, that I must have food nourish-
ment or I could never recover.
"I began to take four teaspoonfuls
cf Grape-Nuts and cream three times
a day and for two weeks this was al-
most my only food; it tasted so dell-
clous that I enjoyed it Immensely and
my stomach handled it perfectly from
the first mouthful. :t was so nourish-
ing I was quickly built back to normal
health and Etrength.
"At the present time I am preparing
a paper for two medical Journals in
which I mention my own case and
Epeak particularly of Grape-Nuts' great
value as food to sustain life during
serious attacks in which the etomach
is 60 deranged it cannot digest and as-
similate other foods.
"I am convinced that Grape-Nuts
more widely used by physicians will
rave many lives that are otherwise lost
from lack of nourishment." Name

Herbert E. Law, who owns property
to the value of $1,000,000, said that he
had no protest to make on any of his
assessments with the exception of a
lot at Pierce and Lombard streets,
which was ten feet below grade. The
board reduced his assessment from
$7460 to $5200.
At the afternoon meeting the an
nouncement was made, that nearly all
of the property south of Golden Gate
Park had been assessed too high and
thatfthe Assessor was working on a
wholesale reduction of assessments in
that locality. A petition from property
holders on Hayes street near Octavia
stating that property on Hayes street
had not Increased in value was read
and referred to the Assessor. The
board adjourned until 9 a, m. Monday.
The applications of the following
owners were referred to the Assessor
for reconsideration: Charles L. Acker
man, Joseph Pilger, Edward Harrison,
Frederick Baruch, E. D. McCreery,
Amelia Haarz, estate of George T.

Sutro said no local body or board had
given the company any franchise. The
Wells-Fargo Company obtained its
right ( to do business from Colorado,
and could not be charged for the right
to do business by California. Assessor
Dodge asked if it was not a fact that
the company was doing a banking
business as -well as express. If such
was the case every bank in San Fran
cisco, whether foreign or not. had to
submit to taxation on its franchise.
After the attorney had left the room
Alpers moved that the assessment on
the franchise be raised to $700,000. The
Assessor replied that this could not* be
done without citing the Wells-Fargo
Company to appear and that the
property was assessed proportionately
'to the actual Increase in real estate.
The company's application for reduc
tion of the assessment was denied.
The morning meeting was devoted
chiefly to the hearing of the complaint
of the Wells-Fargo Express Company
against the assessment of their prop
erty at Mission and Second streets.
This led to a lengthy discussion be
tween Supervisors Alpers and the com
pany's attorney, Alfred Sutro. The
company asked that this year's as
sessment of $417,000 might be reduced
to last year's figure, $181,000. Super
visor Alpers inquired if this included
the franchise. Sutro answered that it
did not. He then went on to explain
that the franchise had originally been
assessed at $700,000. but was reduced
last year to $450,000, and this year to
$250,000. '
Two sessions of the Board of Equali
zation were held yesterday at the City
Hall, one at 9:30 o'clock in the morning
and the other in the afternoon at 2:30.
The complaints against high assess
rncnts this year have exceeded those
of the last' year and the board still has
over 600 applications to hear. This
must be done before noon oh Monday,
as that is the time limit allowed by law
for the board to act upon the applica
tions.

A sentinel ran along the seawall and
called upon the rower to come back,
but no attention was paid to him and
he fired five shots. Bostwick. who lay
prone In the boat, was hit in the cheek.
The bullet passed through his neck and
severed an artery. An army boat by
that time had overhauled the rowers
and towed them back to the island.
Bostwick's companions were not
wounded.
NEW YORK, July IS.â ThreÂ« soldier*
imprisoned on Governors Island for
desertion tried to escape in a rowboat
yesterday. One of them. Private Al
fred Bostwick, was shot by a sentry.
The bullet passed through Bostwick's
jaw and he probably will die. His two
companions, when they saw Bostwick
wounded, promptly stopped .rowing.
They were overhauled, taken back to
the island and put in the guardhouse.
Bostwick's companions were William
Rheiner and a man named Cox. They
had been model prisoners and Bost
wick was to have been released August
1. Rheiner would have been freed two
months later, but neither was aware of
the shortening of their terms.
The prisoners were at work on an ex
tension of the island defenses being
made by filling in. No particular at
tention was paid to them and they
Â¦cized the opportunity to escape by
wading into the bay and seizing a row

Terry of San Francisco; first vice
president. Miss May Concannon of Liv
ermore; grand secretary and treasurer.
Miss J. T. Molloy of San Francisco;

terrible disease, locomotor ataxla. Power to
balance, stand, or even sit down, entirely lost.
Two best doctors of San Francisco and Hot
Springs. Ark., failed to help me. My stoxn-
: acji, bowels and kidneys failed to work. I had
catarrh of stomach, head and bladder as a re-
sult of the dlwase; these troubles became
chronic. At times ray heart would beat like a
arum, my eyes grew weak, my memory bad.
my J? erve8 wr 'cked. Three months ago I went
to Tuscan Springs. What happened since was
a pleasant surprise to me. Drank the waters.
took the bathsâ after three weeks' treatment

merit, walked without a cane, with eyes closed

Superior Judge Graham has sounded a warning against
the alarmingly increasing tendency of our people to
divorce. California, however, wretched as is l:sr record
in the divorce court, is not the only State in the Union
in which marriage is perhaps the single "civil contract
which is held most in contempt. . Clearly no more dan

. A timelysuKRcstion for an adequate^nocturnal govern
ment of our. city has come from no less an authority
than one of our worthy Superior Judges, who recom
mends, with emphasis born bf conviction, that police
officers be armed with shotguns for judicious 'use upon
night-prowling footpads. The* idea is a splendid one.
If it accomp\ishes nothing more it will keep the police on
their beats during the silent watches of the night.

On one remarkable means of treat
ment for incipient valvular disease of
the heart which these long-forgotten
Nile doctors taught Dr. Caton Â¦ laid
great stress. It was the method rec
ommended at least 4000 years ago to
let the heart have as much rest as
possibleâ a wise injunction, said thy
Harveian orator, which we may. yÂ«t
practice with advantage. I-em-hotep
seems to havetbeen an all-round genius
â physician, architect,^ astronomer, al
chemistâ so illustrious that after death
he was reputed the son of, the supreme
deity, Ptaliâ all â¢ this and^ yet nearly
iost to fameâ New York Sun.
Not Greece, therefore/but Egypt, long
before Galen and Hippocrates, was the
motherland of rational , medicine -and
anatomy. The views , of the Greeks on
the circulation of the blood were almost
exactly those which the Egyptians bad
taught many centuries earlier.
These were probably, Dr. Caton
thinks, the first of mankind to acquire
a rudimentary knowledge of the move
ment of the blood.' Their papyri con
tain Intelligent references to the heart,
the blood vessels and the pulse. Of
the heart in particular they knew
much, and their writings refer to its
enlargement, fatty' degeneration, dis
placement, palpitation and perlcardial
effusion. One remarkable passage of
these old-world Inquirers speaks of dis
tension of the^heart and shortness of
breath as occurring because the blood
has stagnated and does not circulate
properly.
As far back as 4000 B. C. Egypt had
works on- medicine and anatomy, and
one brilliant genius â forgotten nowa
days and omitted from the cyclopedias
â lem-hotep. priest of the sun god Ra,
and physician to King Torsothros, be
came so eminent that he was revered
as a demigod after death, a temple
was built over his tomb, and in his
honor hospitals were raised In Mem
phis and other cities. Here the priest
physicians treated the sick and em
balmed the bodies of men and sacred
animals. /
The Harvelan oration at the Royal
College of Physicians, London, was de

Prisons in Japan resemble large
country houses with many outbuild
ings and do not. either in the solidity
or details of their construction, wear
a penitentiary aspect. Their prison
ers get food in proportion to their
conduct and industry; those who do
not behave will , get a cake of rice,
which must last them seven days. For
the deserving it Is the ration for but
four days, and they get with It also
a little horse meat and potato or pea
sauce. The' labor i3 compulsory, but
not severe, and the prisoner gets part
of his earnings, though it amounts to
little. The discipline is military, and
serving a term in prison does not im
pose an indelible stigma. Systematic
efforts are made to improve the pris
oners: all the youths under 19 years
pass two hours each day in school.
Even when their term of sentence Is
over they cannot be released till a
surety is found for their subsequent
good behavior. Till this is provided
they must remain in prison and may
do so for indefinite periods. Of late
societies have been formed to care for
the prisoners and keep them under
observation after they have been re
stored to society. Jail life there is
accompanied by all the ameliorations
of which it admits without impairing
its disciplinary and reformatory char
acter, and when it is over the convict
has a new chance in life, with no dis
abilities that diligence and good con
duct may not overcome. â New York

Japanese Prison Methods.
THE Sacramento Union / is alarmed because the
channel of the Sacramento River, about a mile
below Sacramento City, was changed during the
high water of the last rainy season, when the famous
Edwards break in the levee on the river bank took place.
The river currents were attracted by the Edwards break.
The river bed was scoured so that there is a depth of
water of twenty-five to iorty feet from a point in front
of the city to a place opposite the break, which is
double the 'former depth of water within this limit. On
theYolo side, where the river "waters -were formerly the
deepest, shoaling has taken place. The river steamboats
now hug the east shore, finding the channel there to
be suited best for navigation. .
The change in the channel, so says the Union, has
brought such pressure against the levee at certain places
that undermining of the banks is in progress. Many
places were observed by the editor of the Union, who
personally made an inspection, where, within a distance
of one mile, the levee is crumbling and falling into the
river.. Where there was a shelving shore, over which
only shallow water ran, there has been created by the
scour of the winter freshets a perpendicular water line,
and the river bank is disintegrating by reason of the
pressure against it. In the described a*rea the water is
hardly less than twenty feet deep close to the levee. .
The situation is therefore declared by the Union to
be alarming. "If nothing shall, be .done to strengthen
the levee and to protect it against the undermining, and
swashing processes of the river it will steadily wear
away, even in ordinary times, while three days of flood
would break through at a dozen places." If the waters
shall again flood the region south of the city, so it is
said by the Union, a large tributary district will again
become unproductive and valueless and even the city
will be threatened, since the Y street levee is not much
more than a mere shell at many points.
Unfortunately there is disagreement among the land
owners who have property along the river in the recla
mation district numbered 385. It is the duty of the dis
trict to look after the levees at the point in question.
The differences of opinion may possibly prevent prompt
action. The Union finds it difficult to provide a way to
make sure that the levees will be attended to without
any unnecessary delay, but suggests, in the emergency
that has unexpectedly arisen, that a committee of citizens
shall be appointed to consult with the land owners of
the section that is directly exposed to danger.
NEW PHASE OF A RIVER QUESTION.
The spectators made a dive for their
valuables and a hasty retreat for the
door.
John Harvey, a well-known pick
pocket, was being tried by the late
Judge Campbell on a charge of va
grancy.
During the testimony Campbell
asked the prisoner if he had not been
convicted of pickpocketlng. The pris
oner replied that he had served a
period in jail for that offense.
*'Well," said Campbell, "the court
finds you guilty of vagrancy and
places your fine at $25. Can you pay
the fine?" asked the Judge.
The defendant informed the court
that he possessed only SIS.
' "Bailiff," sang out the Judge, "turn
the prisoner loose and allow him to
mingle with the crowd for a few
moments."
One of Judge Campbell's.
The police have made another of their periodic, farci
cal and ineffectual raids upon one of the notorious and
dangerous dives that flaunts its indecency upon Market
street. It is strange that the concentrated intelligence
of the entire police force can neither discover nor sup
press an evil that is patent and offensive to everybody
else and which would njn be tolerated for a night nn
any other American city. Perhaps the investigators
pursue their inquiry on greased ground. *
A bright young woman visiting in
this city when a3ked* for her photo
graph gave it after writing thereon
the following inscription:
If on this careless Irish face . '
Some soul of good your eye can trace.
Take heed, 'tis but deception;
Whatever good or grace you sea
Belongs to you and not to me,
It's merely your reflection.
PATRICIA.
To a Native Daughter.
As is well known, when an aye and
no vote is ordered, it is the desire of
both parties that as fall a vote as pos
sible shall be polled. In furtherance of
this desired end, there is now in opera
tion throughout the Capitol building a
Ej-Ftem of bell signals which Indicate
when a poll of the House or Senate is
about to be made. These bells ring in
the various committee rooms, in .the
restaurant, the barber shop and other
hind the House building at the most,
and when it is completed the subway
and electric transportation facilities
provided for the House will be dupli
cated. In addition to the two tunnels
leading respectively from the House
building and the Senate building to
the House and Senate wings of the
Capitol, the tunnel will be carried
across to the east front, so that
through trips may be made from the
Senate building to the House building.
It is not believed that the loop will be
much in service for passenger traffic,
although it will be extensively used
for minor freight carrying purposes.
Mr. Elliott Woods, superintendent of
the Capitol, under whose supervision
the two great office buildings are to be
erected, is planning to begin work on
the passenger subway this summer. It
will be necessary to ditch the Capitol
grounds from one side to the other. It
is desirable that this should be done
when Congress is not in session. Mr.
Woods is also anxious that the tunnel
may be partially completed at least
by next December In order that it may
be used for bringing supplies into the
Capitol. At the present time much of
the east front of the Capitol is given
over to the handling of freight and ex
press packages, food stuffs for the res
taurants, ice, laundry and various
other things. When the tunnel is in
operation these supplies will be dis
tributed through it. A terminal station
for handling this class of freight will
be located in the basement of the
House building. As the completion of
the tunnel will precede that of the
office building, however, Mr. Woods
contemplates the erection of a tempo
rary terminal to be used during the
coming session of Congress. It is more
than likely that the coal used in the
lighting, heating and ventilating plant
in the Capitol will also be brought into
the building through the new subway.
The plans have been drawn and give
a precise idea as to the location of the
two new office buildings flanking the
Capitol grounds, together with the pro
posed subway connecting them with
the Capitol and with each other. They
also show the location of the new cen
tral power station for the Capitol and
the office buildings in the vicinity, au
thorized at the last session of Congress.
This power station is to be erected at
the intersection of New Jersey avenue
southeast with the new line of the
PÂ«nnslyvanla railroad. It is expected
that it will be completed and in opera
tion within two years. Then the pres
ent power plant in the Capitol will be
abandoned. There will be no mere
emoke in the vicinity of the big struc
ture on_ the hill. Neither the House
nor the Senate office buildings will con
tain furnaces or boilers and hence there
v.ill be no unsightly chimneys.
The new central power station will
be a costly affair, so far as the initial
outlay is concerned, but it is expected
that the economy of operation and of
lighting and heating several of the big
buildings from one plant will more
than offset the heavy expenditure re
quired at the start. The plans also
show the proposed location of the next
new building to be authorized near the
Capitol, on the corresponding square to
that occupied by the Congressional Li
brary.
The convenience and the serviceable
nets of the system of subway connec
tions planned for the Representatives
and Senators cannot be overestimated.
This will especially apply to the mem
bers of the House, who are greater in
number than the Senators and are
more often required on the floor to
vote on a roll call.
With a final warning that all shall
be aboard, the little train will go hum
ming from its station. It v.ill pass
through a brilliantly lighted subway
under the southeast lnwns of the Cap
itol grounds, and within a very few
seconds will halt in the sub-basement
of the House winp. Here the mem
bers will disembark to find themselves
within easy access of the private ele
vator leading to the floor of the House.
The journey will require the briefest
possible fdrcc of time.
As a counterpart to the House of
fice building Congress, at the session
just closed, made provision for the
construction of an office building for
the Senate. The House building is to be
located opposite the southeast corner
of the Capitol grounds, while the Sen
ate building will occupy the corre
sponding square to the northeast. The
Senate building: will be but a year be-

led!' Train leaves in two minutes!"
When the magnificent new office
structure for members of the House
of Representatives shall be an accom
plished fact the above call will not
he an unusual one during the sessions
of Congress.
On the main basement floor of the
building will be the terminal station
of an up-to-date little electric rail

fort of the distinguished gentlemen
who make up the membership of the
lower branch of the national legisla

THE State Board of Trade, in line with its mission
as the pioneer and most skilled promoter of the
material interest's of the State, has taken up the
improvement of the quality of our wheat. . Where wheat
U used as the bread corn the vast majority of mankind
eat bread and butter without knowing just why, except
that their forebears did. The grasses are the most
widely distributed of any of the plants, and are the most
useful. All of bur cereals, including corn, are grasses,
The bamboo and sugar cane are also grasses, as are the
Egyptian and Kaffir corn, rice and millet, in all its vari-
The grasses and legumes have upon them the principal
responsibility for sustaining animal life on the earth.
The .grasses differ in the chemical elements they store,
and the same grass varies in that respect in different
localities and seasons. The first scientific brewing in
this country was done at Milwaukee. While stuff called
beer is made of broken rice and corn and glucose, real
beer is made only of barley malt and hops. When each
brewery employed a chemist to test the lupuline content
of the hops and the quality of the barley, and to supply
deficiencies by using more, and to guard against a surplus
by using less, there was brewed an even and excellent
quality of beer that would have made wassail in Valhalla.
The experience of the brewers proved that barley
varies in strength and quality, with the locality in which
it is grown, and sometimes with the season. What the
grasses put into the seeds they bear and the juices they
store they must get from the soil and the air. Unlike
the legumes, they are principally soil feeders, and must
find the material for their" seeds and juicesih the ground.
Until the State Board of Trade took it up as a matter
vital to the State's position as a wheat producer, proba
bly not one man in a million looked upon wheat except
as an invariable thing, the same everywhere. Now it
is known of many that as only a perfect barley can make
good beer so also only perfect wheat can make good
bread.
Some kinds of wheat are more expert than others in
getting out of the soil what they want." The straw is
stiffened by silicate chosen from the soil by the plant.
Silicate is flint. The plant finds it, makes it into a solu
tion, takes it up in its juices and recrystallizes it on the
external surface of the straw. Now one kind of wheat
will get less silicate than another. Its straw will be
weak and the crop wilP'crinkle" to the loss of the owner.
The grain of wheat should contain starch and gluten, the
one making fat, the ether muscle and strength. The
kinds of wheat grown in California arc deficient in the
secretion of gluten. Either our wheat soils are exhaust
ed of gluten or we must have a more skillful and expert
wheat to find it for us. Our .wheat will not mill into
proper flour unless mixed with the glutinous grain of
Kansas and the Dakotas. Our flour export goes princi
pally to Asia, where they want a "strong" flour, which
means one rich in gluten, and we must glutinize our flour
or lose our market. x
It. is useful to. study the history of the wheats we are
importing to grist with ours. Kansas had no standing
as a wheat State a^few years ago, and Minnesota held
the first place as a producer of that grain. - A Russian
Mennonite, an exile, introduced into Kansas a Russian
wheat, which was eagerly taken by such expert and
scientific millers as Bowersock of Lawrence, and made a
flour highly prized by every baker, housewife and bread
eater in the State. Perhaps none of them knew why
this new wheat was so good, but the reason was its
stock of gluten and proper proportion of starch. The
same grain superseded the Canada Club and tea wheats
of the Dakotas. There are reasons for believing that the
Minnesota wheat had the same deficiency which" the
State Board of Trade discloses in ours, for beginning
five years ago the. Minneapolis millers began largely to
import Kansas wheaj for combined gristing with their
own. At first they did this surreptitiously and denied
it when charged with it, but a sharp wheat man in Kan
sas exposed them, and since then the importation and
mixture have become public commercial facts.
It is known that: the decline in quality of our wheat
in respect to its gluten content has been concurrent with
the introduction and general use. of varieties that are
used in the East, where there is also a decline in the
quality of the flour. It is known that, we can breed
plants just as we do animals. Man has produced one
strain of cattle for its butter fats, and. another for its
casein, and still others for their beef quality. ,Thc
spreading knowledge of vegetable physiology, teaches us
that we may breed plants in the same way. We may
as easily have a breed of gluten wheat as of butter fat
cattle. \ - 11 \'
The wheat grower who will in his own fields begin
the remedy of the crop is entitled to his reward. The
grower of wine grapes and' of sugar beets is paid ac
cording to the sugar content of his produce. Every
grower therefore, strives by fertilizing, irrigation, drain
age, angle of exposure to the sun and all other means,
to increase the sugar content. The flour gristcrs will
soon be buying wheat tested for its gluten content, and
varieties now used that arc poor in gluten will give way
to those that are rich.
In selecting/and breeding wheat, the Agricultural De
partment at Washington can. give much information. It
has introduced already- the macaroni wheat, a Russian
grain that must be ricji in glucose to answer its pur
pose, and the department has also had on hand for some
time experiments in cerear breeding. A considerable
area in California is always to be. used for wheat. Until
domestic consumption overtakes production, it is to be
a valuable article of export. " It : is the bread corn of
the world, and. all. that concerns it is a concern of man
kind. As the State Board of Trade never fails in- any
undertaking; its conduct; of this, cxperiment'for renewal
of the. quality of 'our wheat will.be watched with keen
If it is possible to do so, Mr. Woods
hopes to complete the excavations for
the tunnel during the next few
months. Both the House and Senate
branches of the tunnel will be exca
vated, so that connections can easily
be made when the office buildings are
under way.
The subway will contain cement
walks in addition to tracks, in order
that members not desiring to ride can
still employ the tunnel for the journey
from offlce building to Capitol and not
be exposed to the blasts of extreme
winter weather. â Washington Star.
Under the new order of things when
a roll call Is about to be had in the
House, tiny bells or "buzzers" will an
nounce the fact in every room of the
new office building. If the members
there should be required in the winter
to put on their coats and walk across
to the Capitol, from five to ten minutes
would be lost in the Journey. With the
subway in operation, however, the sig
nal for a roll call will be the signal
for extra service on the double tracks
of the House subway. It Is then. that
the "Roll Call Limited" will be an
nounced. Frequently rapid trips will
be made by the fast-moving little trol
ley trains between the House building
and the House wing of the Capitol un
til all the members who desire to vote
have been transported from their of
fice apartments to the House chamber.
The passenger terminal in the base
ment of the office building will be lo
cated conveniently to the elevator
shafts. The tunnel will probably be
heated sufficiently to make the tem
perature comfortable at all seasons.
Thus the Representatives may in the
morning proceed to their offices at New
Jersey avenue and B street and there
doff their overcoats for the day. At 12
o'clock they will journey through the
subway to the Capitol and will go back
and forth during the day as their
wishes dictate. The facilities for the
House building will be duplicated in
the office building far the Senate.
The subway will be a two-track af
fair, leading from the Senate and
House wings to the respective offlce
buildings. The loop along the east
front of the Capitol will be a single
track. The tunnel will be amply Ven
tilated, lighted and heated." The in
terior will be of light-colored glazed
brick, and all semblance of dampness
will be done away with by the most
modern methods of waterproofing. As
already stated, there will be passenger
and freight trains in operation. The
passenger cars will be open, of course,
and will resemble the cars of roller
coasters and scenic railways In design,
although more comfortable and lux
uriously upholstered.
The tunnel will be used permanently
for bringing office supplies, restaurant
supplies and the like into the Capitol
building. The House office building,
being conveniently located, will have a
depot for depositing these supplies,
and they will be transported from
there. The basement of the building
will have several tracks in the prin
cipal corridors to facilitate the moving
pf this minor freight. . The employ
ment of the tunnel for coal carrying
purposes will continue during the pro
gress of the construction of the 1 new
central power station. It is hoped
that this may be -completed, simul
taneously with the House office build
ing. Two lines of ducts connecting the
power station with the Capitol and
surrounding office buildings will be
laid. One will be in South Capitol
street and the other in First street
East In case of accident to either of
these lines the duplicate system can
be employed.
When the new office building for
members of the House is completed at

east it is safe to assume that whenever
possible the Representatives will spend

sons for such exclusion, it is probable that they have no
further information than was gained by looking at the
mountains.
The part of the park that is in controversy lies below
the cascades, and between the Merced and Tuolumne
rivers. It was largely in private ownership before the
reserve was. -created. | There are within it eighty valuable
gold mines and mining claims, and water power and
other private property of value, which,, under the pig
headed policy of the Interior Department, is made
worthless to its owners by denying them" the right to
make any use of it.
Congress has repeatedly refused to buy these private
holdings. Indeed, the Government could not undertake
to buy mines and riparian property. But as the Interior
Department will not permit the owners to use it, the
Government has practically confiscated it and has there
by robbed several hundred citizens of their property.
In /heir desperation these men proposed to exclude that
part of the reserve from the Yosemite National Park
and include it in the adjoining forest reserve. They
hoped that under forest reserve regulations robbery of
their use of their property might' be prevented. The
bill did not pass, and the Interior Department has sent
these representatives out to find a reason for something
it has already done.
If these several hundred citizens of California who
bought mines, land, and water power of their own Gov
ernment had bought the property of Mexico, or any
other country and within its jurisdiction, and then had
been in like manner robbed of the use of it, our Govern
ment, would long ago have interfered and their rights
would be adjudicated by the Hague Court. But they
are robbed by their own Government? Ihe people are
denied the use of water power and natural resources re
quired to build up that part of the State, and a number
cf our industries suffer as a result, while dilettante, ex
aminations are going on and strangers are sent here to
decide for us whether Californians are not guilty of
grave offenses because they >. complain of being robbed
and outraged by their own Government. *

CAPE DISAPPOINTMENT â W. F.
R., City. The following from the Pa
cific Coast Pilot Chart, 13S9, tell how
the promontory in the State of Wash
ington known as Cape Disappointment
came to be so named. "On July 6.
1778, ifears, in the ship Nootka, arrived
off the cape and found that a
'prclisious easterly swell rolled alonff
the shore,' and he had soundings made
in sixteen fathoms over a hard, sandy
bottom. 'After we had rounded the
promontory, a large bay, as we had
imagined;, opened to our view that
bore a very promising appearance and
into which we steered with every en
couraging expectation. As we entered
the bay the water shoaled to 9. S and 1
fathoms, where breakers were seen
right ahead, and from the masthead
they were observed to extend across
the bay." Thereupon the cape wa3
named Disappointment. It was called
Cape Hancock by Gray in 1792. He
chai.ged this name to Disappointment
upon hearing that Mears had so named
It. That name was retained by other
navigators. The name Disappointment
Is that used on the official charts and
by all navigators, although the pro
montory has been called Hancock and
San Roque."

Marital tragedies, on land and sea,
were told tersely yesterday' in two
cross-complaints filed in the Superior
Court against suits recently brought for
divorce. The sea story has to do with
the coaster schooner Ludlow. The cap
tain of the vessel, William Tornstrom,
begun suit for divorce a few days ago
I and charged his wife with running
away with another captain on April 6.
The deserted husband added that his
wife was guilty of infidelity with the
same unnamed captain on April 7,
and with several other men, unknown,
since that date. He declared that she
was living with her sister at 3101 Cali
fornia street in this city, and was con
ducting herself in an unwomanly man
ner.
Yesterday, through her attorney.
! Arthur H. Barendt, Mrs. Tornstrom filed
! an answer denying specifically all of
j his charges of desertion and infidelity,
but upon her own account she asked,
in a cross-complaint, for divorce upon
the ground of extreme cruelty.
The Tornstroms were married on July
13, 1903. The wife then went to live
with her husband on the schooner Lud-
I low. On January 22 last when the boat
i put out from San Pedro bound for
j Port Hadlock, Wash., Tornstrom Is
I said to have struck his wife and thrown
| her about the cabin. On March 5 they
were visited on board by Captain Lass
and at la. m. tHÂ£ husband became

I charged with having kicked and struck
! Mrs. Tornstrom, and when the boat was
i lying off Port Townsend, she says, he
{ compelled her to go ashore and visit
j saloons and improper houses with him.
On April 2, she says, Captain Rose,
an "aged gentleman," visited them on
the schooner and her husband became
enraged and accused her with flirting
with the old man. On April 6, be
j cause of his cruel acts she left him
j and the boat, and has continued to live
j apart from him since. She says that
he receives from $150 to $200 a month
and owns property worth $6000. Out of
this amount she asks for $100 a month
I alimony pending the trial of the suit.
George Schmoll filed a cross-com
plaint to his wife's suit for divorce. He
says they were married at Reno April
8, 1903, and that on May 10 following
she took employment at the Washing
ton dance hall In this city. Here she
associated with drunken men and
women and besought strange men to
purchase intoxicating liquors. On July
13 of last year she struck him and
called him vile names, and on August
23, he says, she cut him with a hat
pin. On March 15, this year, Schmoll
says, he went to Washington Hall

duct. She retaliated by throwing a

my real name is Lizzie Clara Belle
Lippe; my folks are Westleys, but I
can't abear the name of Lizzie, so I
call myself Beatrice â where was I at.
Judge â oh, yes^ â so Fred says, says
he, 'All right, Beatrice, get a divorce
and I'll marry you,' and ever since
then we have been the best of friends,
but I'm afraid he might leave me and,
between you and I, Judge, that's what
I came out here to get a divorce for,
and J wish you'd come out to my flat
and see the lovely embroidery I do
with these hands, and everybody says
I could make a good living at it, but
thank goodness, I don't have to work,
for I have a steady income and my
horse and buggy and I'm sure I don't
know what'll become of them if I go
to jail, for Fred is so careless that
he'd be sure to let the horse starve to
death, and I'm sure I never saw any
one as careless as that Fred Forstlng,
and his own folks say that they never
could depend upon him remembering
a thing "
"Guilty of disturbing the peace and
battery â sentence Monday."
"I'm sure, Judge, you don't mean
that, for I told you that if I'm not
crazy I'll go crazy, sure, if you put
me back in that cell â "
"Take her away."
"Well, if it must be, it must be, and
I know you'll let Fred in to see me,
and â "
The remainder of the Sentence was
uttered in the corridor.
On the previous day Mrs. Lippe
tried but failed to convince the court
that she was demented and the gen
eral expectation that she would in
dulge in some other spectacular vag
ary yesterday was amply fulfilled. Af
ter the Judge's repulse of the floral
tribute she. sat upon the prisoners'
bench and ogled Bailiff Hickey until
his frowns seemingly scared her and
then she violently thumped her chest
and gasped and complained of heart
failure. She was hurried upstairs and
restored to the custody of the prison
matron until her case was called,
when she reappeared and rattled off a
defense that allowed no other person
to get in a word edgewise.
Mrs. Annie Lippe, charged with
having disturbed the peace of the ten
derloin at an early hour last Friday
morning, laid a bunch of pink sweet
pea blossoms upon Police Judge Mo
gan's desk yesterday and smilingly In
formed his Honor that it was a slight
token of her esteem. The fragrant of
fering was politely declined and the
woman pouted her displeasure.
Patrolmen E. J. Wlskotchell and C.
Ogden were assigned to the task of
rounding up and running in women
who conduct alleged massage or for
tune-telling establishments as a cover
for illegal vocations, and 'the result of
their first day's work was the appear
ance in Judge Mogan's court of nine
defendants â three "Mauds," two
"Birdies," one "Violet," one "Tessie,"
one "Ruby" and one "Daisy." The
policemen recounted weird experi
ences, one of them having taken no
less than four vapor baths in a single
evening. As they told their respective
stories the nine defendants indulged in
running comments of uncompliment
ary tenor, "Mean old thing," "Reg
ular sneak" and "He told me he was
an army officer," being some of the
remarks audible to Bailiff Hickey. De
fense will be heard to-morrow and
Wednesday. : - ; -\ : j / -.Y
Patrolman Joy heard the tinkle of a
banjo in a Pacific-street dance hall
after midnight Friday and he burst
the door and arrested all the inmates,
fifteen in number, and pretty equally
divided as to sex. Their defense be
fore Judge Fritz was that they came
from Alameda to celebrate the birth
day of a young woman of -that town
who has made quite, a. hit as a
danseuse, and that they were ignorant
that the. Jaw prohibits the playing' of
musical instruments in saloons after
the solemn hour. Cases dismissed. .
Health Officer "W. D. Hobro arrested
D. Iwatakl, a Japanese, for practicing
plumbing without a certificate, and in
cidentally informed Judge Mogan that
the absence of a plumbers' license law
from the Hawaiian statutes has re
sulted in placing an important indus
try entirely In the control of the lit
tle brown men. Iwataki's case will be
heard to-morrow and the prosecution
is likely to be vigorously pushed.
Judge Fritz gave John Sands sixty
days' imprisonment for stealing a pair
of gardener's shears from the cus
todian of Portsmouth Square, whose
name, by the way is Gardener.
A similar sentence was imposed by
the same Judge upon Frances Lopez
for drunkenness. In five years Frances
Lopez has descended from being the
pride of a respectable Spanish family
to being one of the most degraded
creatures on the Barbary Coast. She,
too, has successfully resisted all mis
sionary efforts to restore her to decent
living.
Judge Mogan gave Kate Gallagher,
who has spent about eleven and three
quarters of the last twelve years in
jail, six months more for having been
drunk and incapable at 11 o'clock
a. m. Friday on Mission street. The
woman's reformation has repeatedly
been attempted by Salvationists, but
she is evidently a hopeless case.
"Ah ban van gode Swede," said
Charles, "and' van gode Swede shoad
naught pinch van gode Swede."
Judge Fritz alleviated Erlckson's
horror to some extent by discharging
him from custody.
Charles Erlckson, arrested at North
Beach for fighting with Michael Quinn.
expressed horror when he ascertained
that the complaining witness, Police
Officer Nelson, was of Scandinavian
birth. r-
? ? Â¦?v;Â»
Margaret Barrett, a good looking
young woman, sold a glass of beer to
Patrolman Down, who was in plain
clothing when he entered her mother's
grocery and purchased the beverage.
She pleaded ignorance of the revenue
laws. Judge Mogan. had the case un
der advisement.
It cost W. Lcsoy, a peddler, $2 50
for each of the two minutes he will
fully allowed his wagon to obstruct a
Washington-street car. The fine was
imposed by Judge Fritz.

Examine Piles of Canceled Checks and
Books Kept by- tlie Defunct
Grain Firm.
The Jurors who. 'are trying the case
against Jacob Eppinger spent , two
hours yesterday morning examining
checks of the defunct grain firm and
looking over the books and other docu
mentary evidence introduced during
the course of the trial. Attorneys for
both sides were present, but no ob
jections were raised at any point of the
procedure. Some of the Jurors took the
packages of checks and ran through
them like bank clerks, examining only
the signatures. Others made careful
scrutiny of the little slips of paper
which ; at one time represented thou
sands of dollars. The checks signed by
Jacob Eppinger during the last year
the firm was In business were segre
gated from those signed by other mem
bers of the firm and examined sep
arately.
Judge Lawlor congratulated the
Jurors on the fact that this would be
the last Sunday they would be obliged
to remain away from their homes and
complimented them on their conduct
throughout the long and at times very
tedious trial. It is expected the. case
will be finally submitted to the* Jury
not later than Wednesday, night.

\s^ Railroad Men's Smoker.
The Transportation Club, which has
entered upon what promises to be a
successful career, gave a smoker in
its temporary clubrooms at the Palace
Hotel last evening. The organization
is composed of representatives of the
different railroad companies. Its mem
bers were largely in evidence last night
and enjoyed several hours of merri
ment, to which the wags and wits of
the local railroad world contributed.
The Alcazar quartet furnished the
music for the affair, which did not
close until after midnight
Those officials who have as sureties
companies who have no license to do
business or who have gone out of busi
ness will be required to give new bonds
so as to legally, and fully protect tha
city against all loss. / â¢
Ten or twelve city officials were cited
yesterday to appear before the Finance
Committee of the Board of Supervisors
to-morro'w to explain certain irregu
larities in their official bonds. The ir
regularities are such that in case of any
shortage or defalcation it would be Im
possible to recover on the bonds, and
on that account the Finance Committee
has - determined on an investigation
with a view to straighten the matter
out.
Upon investigation it has been ascer
tained that one of the surety companies
on several of the bonds has no license
to do business, while another has gone
out of business entirely.
Two or three bonds of employes of
the Board of Public Works are made
out to\the city instead of to the B*oard
of Works, which would be enabled to
shirk responsibility should funds be
misappropriated.
Among those whose bonds are under
investigation are Police Commissioner
HuttOn, Morris Levy, secretary of the
Board of Works, and others.
The Finance Committee will insist
that bonds Issued in favor of the city
shall be amended so aaxto run to the
Board of Commissioners whose sub
ordinates are required to give bonds.

The conference between the Brewers*
Association and the Brewers' Union
yesterday resulted in an absolute re
fusal on the part of the association to
grant the demands of the union and
the threat of a general strike being car
ried out is probable. .
Committees from both organizations
met at the headquarters of the associa
tion in the Flood building yesterday af
ternoon and discussed the questions at
issue behind closed doors. The agree
ment which had been drawn up by the
union was taken up by, sections and
the majority of the clauses were ac
cepted wfth a few minor changes.
When the article relating to wages was
reached the members of the associa
tion committee took a determined
stand against, allowing the pay- to be
quoted at $22 per week. That article
has been thfi cause of the differences
existing between the union and" the as
sociation and was really the meat of
the, proposed agreement.
Members of the union commlttep
argued for the increase, but the asso
ciation : representatives insisted â¢ that
the wages be placed at the old figure
of $20 a week. The union men would
not consent to that and negotiations
were broken off. Had there been. time
to get notices for a meeting out early
enough for the members of the union to
assemble last night, a special meeting
of the union would have been called
and the report of the committee sub
mitted at once. Many of the notices
for a meeting would have to be sent
through, the mall, and only a few of
the members would have been notified
in time. Therefore a special meeting
has been called for to-morrow night.
The stahlf^faken by the association
was based on the claims that material
was too high, the season was poor, the
present price of labor was all the busi
ness could afford and that the men
were continually asking for more pay
and it was the proper time for the asso
ciation to refuse any further Increase.
AH of those facts were told the union
committee during the argument over
the scale. The committee from the
union was also told " that it would be
useless to , prolong the discussion.
"As soon as /the result of the confer
ence between the association ana the
union became known at the union
headquarters expressions in favor of
striking "were abundant. The notifica
tion sent by the union to the associa
tion on Friday was plain on the sub
ject that unless the demands were
complied with there would be. a Strike
declared. None of the union men will
admit that there is any possibility of
the union Â¦ receding, from the stand
taken at "the meeting Thursday night.
If that same feeling prevails at the
meeting to-morrow night a strike will
be declared to take effect Tuesday
morning., Z'^'S.t Â¦'Â¦. . '
Members of the association decline
to discuss the possibility of a strike, as
they think 1 the union will accept- the
at his wife's former home, 800 Bush
street, that he intended to call Consul
Goodnow to account when he came .to
this country, but decided to let the
whole matter drop. He does not like
the Far East, he says, and means to
remain in the United States. Ballen
tine declin'es to discuss the sensational
scandal in which he so promlnentl>
figured and Is silent about the consular
officials at Shanghai, Amoy, Canton
and Hongkong.
Third Assistant Secretary Peirce is
also silent when the names of Consuls
McWade and Goodnow are mentioned,
as he is reserving all the information
he acquired for the Washington offi
cials.
It is a part of the story. that at
this stage of the proceedings John
Goodnow, Consul General at Shanghai,
is said to have informed the
terror-stricken Mrs. BallentUie that
he could get her husband out
knd away for $5000. This is also
one of the matters that Mr. Peirce, the
Third Assistant Secretary of State, Is
said to have Investigated. It is a fea
ture of this interesting account that
the young lady mentioned declined to
put up the money. At any rate, back
to Manila went Ballentine under guarcL
He was tried but not convicted, and
then he was tried again with the same
result. Strange rumors anent the trial
were brought to this country, but then
all life is peculiar from an- American
standpoint In the queer lands of the
Orient.
PRISONER IS FREED.
When it was all over Ballentine was
freed. At present he is said to be en
gaged in business in Hongkong. His
fellow employe, who was tried with
him, is reported to be no longer con
nected with the Insular Government.
A Vice Consul, who was said to be Im
plicated in the plot, wanted to resign,
but could not do so.
Ballentine says he was born in Bom
bay. His brother is an officer in the
English army in India. While yet a
mere boy> the hero of this story came
to the United States. He was educated
at an eastern college, where he was
prominent in society and athletics. He
was oresident of his class and captain
of the varsity football team. He was
a social lion with the girls at Smith
and at Mount Holyoke. Among his
f rjends were the sons of some of the
most eminent American families.
Ballentine has a straightforward,
manly appearance and Is a Chesterfield
in manner. Through his friends ht
was introduced into the best soclet>
wherever he went. After his gradua
tion from college three years ago ht
came to San Francisco on his wa.
around the world as a guest of th<
son of General Francis Walker, forme
president of the Massachusetts Instl
tute of Technology. While here ht
drove a dray for a day or two durin;

some. notoriety at that time by beim

search of adventure. He was an hon
ored guest at several bf the leading
clubs and mingled somewhat in society
While on this first visit he met Mrss
Yvette du Bois, heiress to a portion of
the Vrooman estate, and they were
married a year ago last June, when he
returned to San Francisco from Ma
nila. It was on his last trip to the
Far East that he cot into trouble.
Ballentlne said last night, when seen
ijis alleged principal lieutenant, who
was also a customs employe, was ar
rested immediately, but Ballentine had
disappeared. He was finally appre
hended in Shanghai and held for de
portation to the Philippines until the
necessary requisition papers could be
prepared.
OFFICIAL BONDS
ARE IRREGULAR
"I was coming down Mission street
just after crossing Ninth at an ordi
nary speed. A large express wagon
was near the track and I was watch-
Ing to see that I did not run into It.
I noticed several children In the street,
but none was near the rails. "When
the car ha*d reached a point opposite
Adams' Tmail laundry at 1231 Mission
street I saw the little boy dart out
from behind the wagon right in front
of me. I threw off the current in
stantly and stopped.
"Springing to the ground, I stooped
down and saw the body under the for
ward axle about four feet from the
front of the car. This shows , how
quickly the car was checked. I tried
to get the body out, but it was held
down by the framework of the car. It
was slow work to lift the heavy vehicle
up and the poor little fellow was dead
when we got to him."
The body was not greatly cut nor
mangled, as the chfflr fell flat between
the rails and the fender rubbed over
the small form. The casing of the
electric machinery near the forward
axle struck and crushed the life out
of the baby.
" From what could be learned from
those present when the fatal accident
took place the boy was playing da the
sidewalk in front of his father's place
of business and while starting to cross
the street tried to run around the ex
press ivagon and got in front of the
car.
The parents of the dead boy live at
24 Washington avenue, a small thor
oughfare running south from Mission
street between Ninth and Tenth. The
body was removed to the Morgue.
The fatal car was No. 1243 of the
San Mateo electric line and the motor
man was E. A. Lindsey, who lives at
48 Chenery street. "William Hirst; of
2117 San Jose avenue was the conduc
tor. Lindsey was immediately ar
rested and taken to the Central police
station, where he made the following
statement:
hastily brought and the basalt blocks
pried up that the implements could be
set under the car, the levers were
forced down again and again to lift
the car a few inches in order to re
lease the baby's body.
Finally the car was raised, but the
child was dead. The tiny form, limp
in the crushing grip of death, soiled
with the dust of the street and stained
with blood, was finally recovered from
the steel running gear. The pale
baby face was pretty in the great eter
nal calm that hovered there and the
touch of the destroyer was the touch
of everlasting peace.

NO AGREEMENT
WITH BREWERS
It is said that more than twenty per
sons were concerned in the conspiracy.
Credentials for the imported Chinese
were forged In the Celestial Empire
at several ports of entry and the spuri
ous documents are declared to have
been knowingly inspected and corrupt
ly approved by employes of the
customs department from Aparri to
Zamboasga. The yellow hordes were
pÂ»ourlng In day by day.
After several thousand coolies had
entered In this manner some honest
officer decided there was something
trronff. A quiet Investigation resulted
and then It was charged that Ballen
tine was rlnsleader of the conspirators.
Men and millions, honor and posi
tion, were Involved. The majesty of
the governments of the United States
and of China was set at naught and
there was fraud, forgery and corrup
tion without end in official circles. Le
gal guilt has not as yet besn publicly
established, although it is whispered
that the formal reports to be present
ed to the State Department will do so.
The crime of which Ballentine and
other distinguished gentlemen were ac
cused is one into which many Ameri
cans in all parts of the country have
fallen. It was the smuggling in of
Chinese coolies in violation of the ex
clusion laws. While such work has
been done on a wholesale plan In
continental United States, all records
were hopelessly chattered by the peo
ple who managed the business In the
Philippines. Th3 coolies entered Uncle
Sam's insular possessions not singly or
in pairs, over the border by night, but
in f quads and battalions, through open
ports In broad daylight.
PLOT IS DEEP LAID.
Ballentine and some of his friends
have rested under severe charges. Of
these conspiracy was the most Im
portant. Thus far no one of them has
gone to the dreary priEons of the Far
East, although the doors to those" un
pleasant abiding places have been
twice or thrice ajar. But lucrative
positions are already vacant and others
etill more desirable may yet be va
cated by their incumbents. The
official ball has started rolling and
according to reports it gains in velocity
day by day.
CONSPIRACY CHARGED.
An inconspicuous passenger on the
Mongolia, which dropped anchor in this
port on Friday, was William Darling
Ballentine. This gentleman is not un
known in San Francisco. It was here
he won the heart of an heiress. The
marriage was a year ago. He is still
better known in the higher social set
of Eastern cities, where he has been
lionized in days gone by. But his name
is most familiar to the Znglish
epeaking people of the lands of the
rising sun. There he enjoys close
acquaintanceship with all classes
from the elite down to the police.
His years are comparatively few, but
his career has been full of action- He
is now the central figure in the most
sensational scandal ever brought to
light in the official circles of Asiatic
lands. The story has kept busy
tongues wagging in every port from
Kobe to Singapore, but as distinguish
ed representatives of great govern
ments were involved, only a few drib
lets here and there have come to the
United States. The Secretary of State,
the Secretary of the Treasury and the
President probably know more about
it than do other Americans, but they
have thus far neglected to furnish an
account ol* the matter to the press.
This case seemed of so great im
portance. It is Eai<3, that even the Third
Assistant Secretary of State was de
tached from service at the national
capital and sent abroad to make a per-
Bonal investigation on which he could
base an authoritative report to his
chief. Ballentine and the Third As
sistant Secretary returned to this
country on the same vessel.
W. D. Ballentine
Is Accused of
Grave Frauds.
Buried under a pall of freshly cut
liveoak twigs, the body of a man,
whose head showed the result of
a heavy blow, was found late this
afternoon in a lonely canyon in the
foothills, two miles due east from the
residence of Isaac L. Requa at Pied
mont. Job W. Chard, an employe of
Shreve & Co., jewelers, residing at 387
Geary street, San Francisco, discovered
the mysterious corpse.
Â¦ It was lying in the bed of a creek in
which there were a few, Inches of water.
The twigs completely covered the re
mains, except a portion of the head.
Chard was staggered by the ghastly
sight. He had climbed down the side
of the gulch to get a drink of water
from the creek, when he suddenly
stumbled upon the half-concealed
corpse. The body lay with the face
upward, and Chard said the twigs ap
parently had been carefully laid over
the remains, as if to conceal them from
view. They had been cut from the
trees along the side of the canyon and
strewn over the prostrate form.
As soon as Chard recovered from his
surprise he left the scene and tramped
three miles out of the hills to a "tele
phone and communicated his discovery
to the Coroner. Deputy Coroner Quel
len met Chard by appointment and was
guided, to.- the body. . They v re,turaejl
late to-night with the body. ' â¢ "\
Dr. O. D. Hamlln and Dr. George
Reinle were summoned to the Morgue.
Their external examination of the re
mains disclosed a large contusion over
the left eye, which might have been
made by a blunt instrument. There
were signs of brain hemorrhage, blood
appearing at the ears. On the right
side of the head was a scratch. The
body's appearance indicated that the
man had been dead about twenty-four
hours. The surgeons would not venture
an opinion to-night concerning the
cause of death. They will hold an au
topsy to-morrow afternoon.
The dead man was clad in cheap ar
ments, well worn. Not a scrap by
which he micht be identified or that
would furnish a clew as to the cause
of death was found on the person.
There were no identification marks on
the body. He was about forty years
old, 5 feet 8 inches tall, 185 pounds in
weight and well nourished. His head
was covered with black hair, slightly
thinned about the forehead. He had
a heavy dark brown mustache and
heavy eyebrows. The eves were dark
"brown. He wore black striped trousers,
a blue checkered sack coat and vest,
low canvas shoes, brown socks, gray
undershirt, white starched shirt, cellu
loid collar, No. 16%, and a gray striped
necktie. The only articles in the poc
kets were a scrap of torn newspaper
and a bunch of twine that might have
been a plumb line or a fishing line.
In explanation to Deputy Coroner
Quellen Chard said: "Every Saturday
and Sunday I spend the days in the
hills when the weather is fine. I was
out to-day on my usual tramp when
I found this body. I had gone down to
the creek for a drink of water. The
manis face was "In full view, and I
started with surprise. It looked at
first as if the body had rolled down
the steep side of the canyon. But on
closer examination I saw that the
corpse had been covered with twigs
and small boughs of trees.
"They had been cut, for the little
branches showed Where a sharp in
strument had been us.ed to sever tnem
from the trees. I got my bearings
and hastened to notify the Coroner,
waiting to direct him to the spot."
Quellen found neither a hat nor a
knife in the gulch that might have be
longed to the man. Sheriff Bishop
will be requested to take charge of
the investigation, _ as the body was
found outside of the municipal limits.

Ball Games Again Postponed.
The Seattle-Portland game at Se
attle and the Tacoma-Los Angeles
game at Tacoma were again postponed
yesterday on account of wet grounds.
The Commuters were Just mean
enough to get busy and break up that
proud record of the locals yesterday.
It was not exactly the Commuters who
did the trick, but more properly Mr.
Buchanan, who pitched such superb
ball for them, and Mr. Townsend,
who played such rotten ball for the
only Uncle Hank. Score, Oakland 3;
San Francisco 1.
Then again, the Eppinger jury was
seen lockstepping through the gate a
few minutes before hostilities began.
Of course this made it look bad for
somebody's ball team, for whenever
the Eppinger Jury blows around there
is sure to be doings. It so happened
that they all kept looking at Cy Town
send and it made Cy feel so bad to
think about it that he made one of
the wildest kind of throws In the fifth
inning and practically broke up the
contest.
Old Phil Knell deserved a far bet
ter, fate. In every round he was there
and very strong. The best the Com
muters got was four hits, and two of
these happened to be the rankest
kind of scratches. But Phil had no
luck, for his team mates could neither
hit nor field behind him in his hour
of need.
At that San Francisco was the first
to score. After two had been laid
away in the third spasm Meany bump
ed the ball against the right field
fence and pilfered second. TownsAnd
drove a sort of semi-Texas leaguer
out to center field and it brought Pat
to the pan with the lone mark of the

Oakland created a deadlock in the
fourth when TValdron dropped Dun
leavy's high fly and Schlafley sent him
around to third with a hit to right
field. A sacrifice by Devereaux scored
Dun and Schlafley got to third. He
was hailed, however, a moment later
while trying to execute a double steal
In company with Devereaux.
The next round bttbught the Com
muters two and settled the strife.
Byrnes partook of a passage to first
and Buchanan dumped a bunt along
the first base line. Townsend got the
ball and threw it in the direction of
second base in an attempt to head off
Byrnes, but the ball refused to go
where Cy Intended that it should. In
stead It took a southwesterly course
and landed by the center field fence.
Byrnes kept on going, as likewise
did Buchanan. The former pulled up
at the plate and the latter at third.
Ganley, the next man up, placed a
long fly out to Waldron, and Buchan
an easily beat the throw to the pan.

SCOTTISH BOWLERS PLAY
TWO TOTJRXAMENT MATCHES
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHICAGO. July 16. â J. W. Fuller's
three-year-old filly Tokalon, by Tam
many-Enid, backed from 5 to 2 to 2
to land made a post favorite, made
a show of her field in the Chicago
stakes at one mile, the feature of the
closing day of the Harlem meeting.
Tokalon was ridden by "Big Bill"
Knapp and covered the mile in
1:38 4-6, which is the fastest race run
on the local track this season. Five
lengths back of the winner was Flying
Ship, backed from 6 to 1 to 5 to 1,
and she had two and a half lengths
to spare over Beau Ormonde, at 30 to
1 and carrying top weight of 124
pounds. The stake was worth $3120
to tha winner, with a gross value of
$3720. Scratches practically ruined
the feature event, as seven of the
thirteen starters were scratched. t
Tokalon simply made a show of her
field. Knapp shot her to the front at
once and with a marvelous burst of
speed she led by two lengths down the
back stretch and increased it to six
lengths turning for home, winning
lightly held, with five lengths to spare.
Beau Ormonde's stretch was one of
the features. He came from last posi
tion with a wild rush and was going
with marvelous rapidity at the end. *
The track was lightning fast,
weather clear and hot and a big Satur
day crowd in attendance. The talent
for the second time this week gave
trie bookmakers a severe drubbing, as
five heavily played favorites captured
flr3t money.
Jockey Knapp was fined $200 after
the second race for crowding English
man and causing him to fall. Sum

The "tennis courts were well patron
ized yesterday afternoon. At the Cali
fornia Club nearly all of the cracks
were present and indulged in soma
lively practice matches.
One of the fastest doubles matches
seen for months was played late In tha
afternoon. The contestants were Dr.
Sumner Hardy and Dr. McChesnay
on one side and Dr. Hill and Dr. Sam
Hardy on the other. It was In tha
nature of. a return match, as Hardy
and McChesney had beaten their op
ponents several weeks ago. Hill and
Hardy turned the tables yesterday and
won two out of the three sets played.
The first two sets were exceedingly
close, each winning one by a 7-5 score.

a great game arid their opponents
failed to get a game.

and is now rated ona of the best
doubles players in the club. Ha la
steady and his volleying Is strong.
In singles Harry Rolfe and Sidney
Salisbury put up a good exhibition.
Salisbury was out of practice and
hardly got started until well along In
the second set. He won the third set,
but lost the first two, the score of tha
initial one being 6-0.

ling lobs. Smith won both sets, but
his opponent made a good showing.
C. Pritchard and L. C. Bozarth
played two close sets. Bozarth had
not played for several weeks, but his
opponent had no easy time beating:
him. The veteran, W. S. MacGavin,
showed that he can hold his own with,
the rising stars. He broke even with
young Melville Long, each winning a
set.
The hounds in the reserve stake at
Ingleside Coursing Park proved well
matched yesterday and some pretty
races resulted. The betting also was
about even up all the way, the only
notable long shots being May Tunni
een, who won from Lily Wright, and
Smiler, who defeated Haughty Helen.
Both dogs sold at 3 to 1.
Piccadilly, .a new hound out of
Princess of Fashion by Hex, showed a
lot of speed and attracted the atten
tion of the spectators by the clever
way in which he outpointed Atlomax.

the time. Lady Menlo and Lulu Girl

Visitors who went to Larkspur yes
terday with the expectation of seeing
Battling Nelson work were sadly dis
appointed, as Nelson and his training
crew quit work for the day to go deer
hunting in the wilds of Tamalpais. The
party started at sunrise and tramped
across country about twelve miles.
The boys met with ill luck, as not a
deer was bagged. Nelson, however, got
a good one en his trainer. He was run
ning over a trail when he came upon
Murphy with a bunch of grass in one
hand and a rope !n the other. He
imagined he possessed a box of sweets
and a bunch of violets and was trying
to entice a deer to camp.
Hanlon. Irwin and Angeli had many
visitors at Croll's Gardens yesterday
and a larger crowd from this side is
expected to cross the bay to-day. The
fighters will commence their work in
the large gymnasium at 3 o'clock in
the afternoon.
Wrestling, rope skipping, bag punch
ing and a tramp on the road consti-.
luted Eddie Hanlon's training work In
Alameda yesterday. He went out for
a spin on the highways in the morning
and in the afternoon put in two hours
at gymnasium stunts. Toby Irwin was
Eddie's opponent on the mat and the
jtalr tupped and pushed each other
over the canvas in a manner that was
strenuous to behold.
Trainer Frank McDonald would not
permit Hanlon to don the gloves and
the little fellow will have to forego the
pame of give and take with the mitts
until his nose is covered with new
cuticle.

BRIGHTON BEACH, July 16.â
Twenty- five thousand persons saw the
$15,000 Brighton Junior Stake won
to-day by James R. Keene's sturdy
colt, Sysonby, son of Melton, one of
whose products was well known to
American racegoers while Melton was
on the turf. In England a few seasons
ago Melton was . regarded - as one of
the most promising young sires in the
world and his owner, Mr. Musker, had
great good fortune with .the product of
that horse.
Sysonby won to-day in a style that
promised much when he would be re
quired to meet better opponents. Mr.
Keene said hie had declined an offer of
$30,000 for him. The first money in
to-day's stake was $12,000.
Hardly less exciting in its nature
than the Brighton Handicap was the
Islip Handicap, the principal feature
to-day outside of the Junior. The
field comprised seven starters, with
James R. Keene's Toboggan favorite
at 4 to 5. The pace was very fast, a
mile in 1:39. Grand Opera had the
rail and Toboggan was forced to run on
the outside of him.' but even then
seemed to be overhauling him until
the stretch turn. When Keene's horse
ran out, or made a wide turn. Mean
time Dainty, in third place, while the
duel was going on between Grand
Opera and Toboggan, made her run at
the head of the stretch.
Dainty won the great race by three
parts of a length from Grand Opera,
who in turn was half a length in front
of Toboggan. The time, 1:51 3-5, was
three-fifths of a second slower than
the track record, made by Bonnibert
in this stake in 1902. Summary:,

he had already interviewed President
Chapman.'of the United Railroads, who
expressed a willingness to carry out the
obligations regarding the keeping of
the corporation's portion of the street
in repair, and he said he felt sure that
the company would co-operate with the
city In carrying out the improvements.
Commissioners Schmitz and Mae?
tretti and City -Engineer Woodward
held' a consultation yesterday for the
purpose of taking steps to induce the
United Railroads to repave a large
number of blocks between their tracks
as the law requires. Schmitz stated
that at least 25 per cent of the neces
sary'vwork of street repairing should be
done by the corporation. The board is

The effort of Benjamin Heath Jr. to
be reinstated In the employ of thÂ£ city
and county, under the _' civil service
rules, was rejected yesterday in a de
cision of Judge Murasky in favor of
the Board of Public Works. Heath sued
for a mandate compelling his rein
statement and the court denies the
writ. In his complaint Heath set forth
that he had taken the civil service ex
amination for field deputy and, passing,
was appointed chief of the bureau. of
streets in September, 1901. On July 3.
1903, he was discharged.
On that day the Board of Supervisors
decided to abolish the office of chief
of streets and also that of superin
tendent of buildings. The latter office,
at the time, was held by Frank
Schmitz, brother of the Mayor. A po
litical scrap was supposed to be on
between the Mayor and Casey, who
was president of the Board of Public
Works. When the Mayor suggested,
in the interests of economy, that the
office of chief of the bureau of streets
be abolished Casey suggested that the
office of superintendent of buildings
should also go. The Mayor agreed to
It and both places were abolished.
In the long opinion rendered by Judge
Murasky the following paragraph is to
the point: "It is not to be assumed
that a department of the municipal
government must maintain employes,
whether upon the civil service list or
otherwise, where there Is no work for
them to perform; on the contrary,
where the proper authorities, acting
in good faith, find that there are no
services to be rendered by an employe
it becomes their duty to remove him."

7. The "Double L.oop": By an unique
routing Santa Fe passengers are taken
into the Valley one way and out another,
giving a complete change of scenery for
over fifty miles. This makes the grand
est stage ride in the world.
VTIS WORTH WHILE TO TRAVEL
ON THE SANTA FE. â¢
t. No sleeping-car berth required:
The rail journey is made entirely in the
day time and the traveler is not put to
the expense of a Pullman berth. This
saves $3.00.
3. California Big Trees seen without
side ride: Santa Fe Yosemite stages
pass directly through two groves of
giant sequoias without side ride or extra
expense. This saves J2 00.
4. Good meals at a moderate price:
Meals along the Santa Fe line to Yosem
ite are most toothsome and cost only 60c
and 75c each. These prices are reason
able and save the traveler on the round
trip about $15 00.
5. Modern stage coaches: Santa Fe
coaches are new-built and especially for
Yosemite service. They are the newest
and most comfortable running into the
Valley.
6. The Merced Canyon entrance to
Yosemite Valley: Santa Fe stages go up
into Yosemite Valley the way the river
comes down. This Is by far the grand
est entrartce to the Valley and passes
cliffs and waterfalls seen on no other
line.
1. A low rate of fare: The Santa Fe
round-trip to Yosemlte Valley, flrst
class, costs only 928 50. This saved the
traveler $10 00.

known as Mme. Fatima Singh, kept
the young Prince Ramina with her
when she man-led a German by the
name of Otto Steinberg. Thus the
Prince received the name of Julius
Steinberg, which he has used since his
arrival in the United States. Prince
Ramina Aramancha . Singh was
brought to the United States in 1833
by a Scotch womanâ a Mrs. Beverldge
âwho adopted. him after the death of
his stepmother. Mrs." Beveridge died
in Salt Lake City in. 1896.
Mrs. Stewart said to-day after her
interview, with the Prince:
"There is not the least doubt in my
mind that this young man is the Prince
Rarnina Aramancha Singh. I am well
acquainted with the history of his fam
ily, and during the time I talked with
him Tasked him a number of questions
which he could not . have possibly
answered had he been an impostor. To
all of them, except some relating to his
mother, the Maharanee Bamba. the
young Prince gave correct answers. Of
his mother he knows but little; but
then he was taken from her at the age
of 4 and never saw her afterward. 1 '

Kohinoor diamond, largest of .the
British crown. jewels and once a pos
session of his ancestors, was presented
by his father to Queen Victoria.

Mrs. Stewart now has In her pos
session a number of photographs of
the Maharajah and his wife, and it,
was by means of these that she es
tablished the identity of Prince Ra
mina. â¢ .
MISSIONARY TESTS HIS CLAIMS.
Mrs. Stewart's attention was first
drawn to the unfortunate scion of In
dian royalty by the published account#
of his arrest and the strange story
told by him, but "she believed the
young man to be an impostor, and
paid little attention to the stories until
she saw In a published interview with
the Prince the, statement that his
mother had been a Buddhist. As Mrs.
Stewart knew that the Maharanee
Bamba hnd lived and died a devout
Christian she decided to silence the
man whom she believed to be ignor
antly libeling her lifelong friend. Mrs.
Stewart took with her to the jail pho
tographs of the Maharajah and his
wife and gave them to Jailer Harry
Clark, instructing him to show them
to the supposed Prince without excit
ing his suspicions as to the identity of
the originals. ' This plot was carried
out.
The Prince was called into the jail
office to-day. He looked at the pic
ture of Maharanee Bamba without re
mark, but when he saw the photo of
her husband he at once exclaimed:
"Why, that is a picture of my father."
Thus, the identity of Prince Ramina
Aramancha Singh was established.
. In. Mrs. Stewart's interview with the
prisoner which followed it transpirefi
that she knew , more of his mother's
history than did the. Prince himself.
This waB not surprising, as the Mahar
anee Bam ba had died when he was but
6 years of age and he had never, known
much about her, having been brought
up by his stepmother, a woman of the
Buddhist faith whom his father had
married in Paris after deserting - hia
first wife two years before she died In
London.- ' / â¢
. In 18S5 Maharajah Singh averted the
Maharanee Bamba, and , taking- his
youngest; son, then 4 years old," with
him, he went to Paris, where, a 'year
later, he married a woman of .the Budd
hist .faith, with .whom lie, lived until
bis death^ The second wife, who was
Mrs. Stewart's father, the Rev.
Ebenezer Currie, was an intimate
friend of Maharajah Dhuleep Singh,
the father of Prince Ramina, and was
present at the marriage of the Maha
rajah to Bamba Muller. a pupil of the
United Presbyterian mission school in
Cairo, Egypt* where for many years
Dr. Currie was a " missionary and
teacher. In later years Mrs. Stewart
and the Maharanee Bamba Singh,
mother of Ramina, became close
friends and this friendship continued
until the death of the latter in Lon
don in 1SS7.
. OAKLAND. July 16.â The- identity
of Prince Ramlna Aramdneha Singh,
who Is confined in the Alameda Coun
ty Jail under the name of Julius Stein
berg, was fully established . to-day by
Mrs. Paul Stewart, .the- wife of tho
pastor of the United .Presbyterian
Church of this city. Mrs. Stewart ful
ly verifies the story of the Prince re
garding his descent and establishes
the only link wanting to clear the
young man of {he charge of falsehood.

that Philb.in had been making life un

Philbin started toward him to carry
out his threat he drew a revolver and
warned Philbln to stop, but Philbln
kept on coming and he shot him. Ways
man does not claim that Philbin had
a weapon of any kind. Philbin has
relatives living In Philadelphia.
Philbin, who is thirty years of age,
said that he has had several occasions
recently to censure Waysman for neg
lect of duty. He says another occa
sion for reproof arose this afternoon:
that Waysman . did not reply* but
walked from the dining-room, evident
ly to get a revolver, returned in ten
minutes and shot him without warn
ing. The bullet entered Philbin's abdo
men, passed through the liver and
lodged near the spine.
Philbiri's version of the shooting is
corroborated by a waiter who was a

OAKLAND. July 16.â The informal
Sunday afternoon tea. which our
neighbors across the bay very success
fully inaugurated some time ago. is
creeping into favor with Oaklanders,
who are really much better situated to
entertain in this delightful fashion than
are San Franciscans. There are so many
beautiful homes here with wide, se
cluded verandas where outdoor life and
a cup of tea may be enjoyed in comfort.
One phase of the Sunday tea that tends
to make it popular is the possibility of
the men folks being present. Until re
cently men have been woefully lacking
in Oakland's social life, but with the
advent of these informal Sunday af
fairs wo may hope to see a cheerful
sprinkling of black-coated tea-drinkers.

In connection with the Circuit Court
injunction, which prohibits' the City
Council from enforcing the 30 per cent
reduction that was made in the schea
ule for the current fiscal year. Auditor
A. II. Breed said to-day:
"I have not decided yet whether or
not the injunction covers the allow
ance of the water company's bills un
der the old rate. This is a matter that
i3 in the hands of my attorney. Until
he shall give me an opinion I cannot
say what I shall do with the water
company's claims against the city."-
City Attorney J. E. McElroy has
submitted a statement to the Board of
Public Works showing that the water
rates litigation has cost the city to
date approximately $25,000.
Of this amount $17,000 ha3 been ex
pended In the first scit that was tried
before Judge E. C. Hart, by whose de
cision a valuation of J7.C00.00O was
placed on the Contra Costa "Water

estimates that expenses of court pro
ceedings, added to the $5000 fees allow
ed for attorneys in the defense of the
second suit in the United States Circuit

gation to at least JSOOQ.
This do^s not Include costs that will

Emery has three attorneys and they
are making every effort to fre3 their
client. He claims that his wife and
children are trying to railroad him to
an asylum. He was sent to the Hospi
tal for the Insane at Stockton once be
fore, but was released about four
months ago as cured. Since his return
his wife states that he has been more
violent than ever, and he has so fright
ened the entire family that they are all
afraid to stay iri the house with him.
Drs- Pratt and Webster and Judge
Ogden expressed themselves as well
satisfied that the man Is insane, buc
according to a provision of the statute
he has a right, if dissatisfied with the
decision of the doctors, to demand, a
jury trial. This has now been done.

A. II. Emery, charged with insanity

Pratt and L. R. Webster this afternoon
and an order for hla commitment to the
State Hospital at Stockton was signed
by Judge F. 13. Ogden. He still has a
chance to fight for his liberty and his
attorneys have given notice that they
will demand a Jury trial for their
client. It Is an unusual proceeding and
owins to the nature of the case has
complicated the situation.
The hearing befoie the Lunacy Com
mission to-day developed the fact that
Emery ha 3 for several years paat been
subject to violent outbursts of temper,
and during them would kick his chil
dren and threaten to kill them. Two
weeks ago he attacked his. wife and
dragged her down into the basement
of the house and threatened to kill her.
lie had three graves dus there, and he
told her sht was to occupy one of them.
Before he offered her any further vio
lence the screaming of his eldest
daughter, about 17 years of age, caused
him to relinquish his hold on the
mother and attack the daughter. He
caught her by the throat and choked
her until she fell to the ground Insen
sible. The m6ther in the meantime es
caped. I^ast Sunday night he went to
the Advent Uaptist Church, and going
into the pew his daughter was
sitting frightentd her sufficiently to
make her faint. In the commotion that
resulted he escaped and was not ar

Love proved stronger than divorce
to-day and Clara Frontier, who on the
ISth of last month obtained a divorce
from Alfred E. Frontier, was remarried
to him again this afternoon. While
they had made much of their troubles,
and she had proved to the satisfaction
of the court that she had been cruelly
treated and that her husband had
pointed a pistol at her and threatened
to kill her, she was willing to forget
and forgive, for a life alone had its sor
rows and of the two she chose to re
turn to those of matrimony.
The Frontiers were married only two
years ago and they have a child of
which both are very fond. Their life
was spoiled, however, by the outbursts
of temper displayed by Frontier, who
abused his wife, swore at her and even
threatened her life. Upon one of these
occasions she made up her mind that
she could not live with him any longer
and began a suit in which she wits only
too successful. Less than a." month's
separation, however, showed them both
that there was a possibility of happi
ness still left them and to-day they de
cided they would begin over again.. In
order that there should be no complica
tion they secured a new license and for
a second time pledged their troth at the
marriage altar.

Crittenden expostulated with the
Constable, showed him his picture in
the papers and also his calling cards,
but nothing availed until he found
"the oldest resident." who identified
the Rhodes scholar as the youth who
hÂ«d sold him a knife last year. When
Crittenden finally grot his freedom he
abandoned his attempt to sell the
wheel and after repairing it rode to
Berkeley.
Crittenden was returning: yesterday
on his wheel from Congress Springy.
When he reached Milpitas the ma
chine broke down. Tired and dusty,
Crittenden way in despair at the pros
pects of having to v.alk home. It oc
curred to him to sell the wheel, how
ever, and he offered it for 56 to sev
eral residents. It was all right until
he approached the village Constable,
who at once suspected Crittenden of
the theft of* a bicycle which had been
Ftolen the day before and arrested
him.
The ignominy that goes with arrest
has been visited upon William Clark
Cr:tter.dÂ«?n. the first Rhodes scholar
the University of California is sending
to Oxford University. Country Con
stables are no respecters of persons,
especially when the persons look like
tramrs. and when Crittenden tried to
sell a bicycle for a low down price the
bucolic sleuth nabbed him on suspi
cion that he was a thief. It took all
of Crittenden's tact and the assistance
of a friend of the "oldest resident"
type to keep himself from beinÂ£ soiled
with the prison bars. At last, how
ever, he was allowed to go on his way
rejoicing.

Two opposing, forces are developing In the
Butter marketâ a bear element, determined to
put the market down- to 19c. and the other
element desirous of keeping the market about
where it Is for the present. There .will prob
ably be some pulling and hauling between
these, two opposing forces during the coming
week. The bears are pointing to the ad
mittedly ijeavy stocks here and -to th*> ex
cessive receipts, which last week were 748 142
founds." against 310,000 pounds - during the
same week last year, the figures being taken
from a local trade Journal. The others say
that the market Is absorbing the receipts very
well -and that there Is no reason for beating
down quotations. ., The feeling yesterday vat
easy and trade was dull, as usual on Saturday.

LONDON, July 16.â The fourth series of the
wool auction rales closed to-day. During the
scries the attendance was large. 'Competition
was keenly showed. Under the Influence of
the large Japanese Government orders and
liuht supplies coarse descriptions advanced
coi'tiderably. Compared with the May sales
the gains were from 5 to 15 per cent. Greasy
Merinos of really good quality were In good
demand for home, Continental and American
spinners. Greasy crossbreds were In good sup
ply and sold well throughout. The total with
drawals were 6300 bales.

The usual Saturday dullness prevailed in the
Potato market, but dealers were firm In their
views and not inclined to force sales and as a
result a large portion of the light receipts
were still on hand at the close. The top quo
tation for river Burbanks was- shaded, as there
was no stock oHering that could command the
previous high quotation of 2c per pound. Re
ceipts of Onions continued light and they were
firmly held at unchanged rates. Â¦ Â¦
The market was still. overstocked with most
kinds of .miscellaneous vegetables and prices
continued to have a'downward tendency. Large
lines of Summer Squash and Cucumbers are
carried over from day to day and thl# carried
over stock can be bought below the minimum
quotations. Asparagus and Rhubarb are at
tracting but little attention now and they have
about had their run. Green Pepper3, Egg
Plant and Corn were abundant and quite a
quantity had to be carried over. Tomatoes
were plentiful again and prices'' ranged lower.
Good ripe stock in large boxes would have
brought $2 easily had there been any available.

In the eastern counties ppring wheat was

CHICAGO, July 15. â Lower cables and great
ly improved weather conditions generally
throughout the country brought out a few
selling orders in the wheat pit at the open-
Ing. For the first few moments of trading
sentiment had an easier tone. Initial quota
tions on September were off a shade to ViÂ® Vie
at 8Â«%c to Sti^iC. Before eelllng orders had
been dlsr>osed of September eased off to 86%@
SGVic. The Northwest, however, sent in buying
orders on . the small opening decline. . The
Northwestern orders caused an I active demand
from pit holders. Shorts covered fully, as
there was very little disposition to carry lines
over Sunday In view of the uncertainty of
the weather. In the Northwest the weather
was extremely hot and there was considerable
apprehension among wheat traders here, as a
combination of wet grounds and high tem
perature was thought liable to injure the
growing crop. 'The situation in the spring
wheat territory was the main bull factor of
the day. Throughout the greater part of the
session sentiment In the pit was decidedly
bullish and at the close all deliveries showed
a gain of %c over last night's figures. Sep
tember closed at the top at S7%c. July ranged
between Mi*o and 96Â«4c. closing at the high
point.
In sDlte of fine weather all over theu.com
belt, the market for that cereal waa^flrm.
The market closed practically at the high
point of the day. September opened- a shade to
>ic lower at 4S%Â«48%c to 40c. sold up to
4t)%c to 4l)Uc. and closed at 40%c.
More strength wne manifested in oats than
has been exDerienced for some weeks. The
market closed near the top. After opening a
shade to Me lower' at 32Â«,@32Jic to 32%c,
September advanced to 33c and closed at 323Â«c.
Trading In provisions was practically at a
standstill, and the market held steady the
entire, day. At the close September pork
was up 7M,c at $12 87>,i; September lard and
ribs were unchanged at $6 Â«2'/ a and $7 57',_,
respectively.

Wheat and Other Grains. j
Â¦ I- .
The foreis* markets were not materially
changed. -Splendid harvesting weather was re
ported in W estern Europe and there was more
Russian Wheat offering.
Chicago advanced lMÂ«c. Aberdeen. South
Dakota, wired: "Crops hurt somewhat by hot.
dry weather. Late and stubbled Wheat poor."
The Chicago letter of Mitchell. . Mulcahy A
Co. said: "It Is a natural reaction after the
breaking tendency of the past two days. There
is nothing new in conditions. Estimates of
damage in the Southwest continue serious, but
from conservative sources there is a tendency
to modify the extravagant ones. The weather
is everywhere better, and, although showers
are predicted dally, it does not shower. This
is a good elgn. The Northwest is getting the
hot, forcing weather which the crop in that
section needs. With good weather, we are
inclined to look for a hesitating market for
the time being. - The July situation U the dis
turbing factor, and the uncertainty is as to
how the cash prices and the July price will
Â¦get together In the next two weeks. It will
probably depend much upon the movement of
the new Wheat to market. In the meantime
i we 'are Inclined /to the view that the eafer
course is to buy September and December
Wheat on sharp.' breaks and accept moderate
profits. Of course, should the weather turn
bad, either for winter or spring Wheat, there
can be but one result." ,

Valentine T. Sellers, editor of a

undergoing a sentence of nine months'
imprisonment in the Ealem jail for al
kged criminal libel. He has not had a
trial on the charge, but, having been
indicted, and failing to appear for trial,
he was defaulted. He appeared volun
tarily recently and asked to have
the default rerrfoved. Judge Wait
cf tho Superior Court refused the re
ueEt ar.d imposed the sentence, on
the ground that by his default Mr.
Sellers had forfeited his right to trial.
Mr. Sellers disputed the sentence, al

Senator Gorman's friends (and foes)
know that his qualities as leader are at
least masterly, but how far they trust
to his Judgment may not be so well
known to the reading public. One of
the statesman's friends had a dream
not so long ago, which he is telling, and
it makes clear the whole Maryland sit
uation.
He was standing before heaven's gate
and St. Peter was just opening it. As
it swung back the venerable warden
asked the name of the new arrival and
proceeded to look up his record in a
great book. Then he said "Enter."
The Marylander hesitated. He looked
all around him and scratched his head,
but he did not advance toward the open
gate.
"Why do you hesitate?" asked the
saint. "Enter." - ;V

the still youthful scribe was an infant
of six summers. Professor Edwin Em

starting for an afternoon tea when Ed

solately on the floor.
"Why, what is the matter, my son?"
quoth the professor. "I want some
thing to read," lamented the Infant.
"To read?" said his father. "Have
not you your 'Mother Goose,' or 'Jack
and the Beanstalk,' or 'Grimm's Fairy
Tales'?"
"I want something classical," said
the 6 year old in scornful tones, and
his yearnings were satisfied. Propped

was wheeled before the library table

all about it until he accidentally found
the volume the other day. Curious to

By planting cotton we encouraged
the boll weevil that lives on cotton.
After killing the birds, in millions, that
might otherwise have kept down the
weevils, we have spent millions of dol
lars more than the milliners ever paid
for the birds* corpses to destroy the
now aggressive and dangerous weevils.
But an ant has been found in Guate
mala that worries the weevil to death,
if it has a chance, so this Government
will send to Guatemala and buy ants.
There is never a doubt that Guatemala
will sell them willingly. If they are as
troublesome as most of the ants in
warm countries, and they will be do
mesticated in the gulf States. .
But then arises the question: Sup
pose they should be equally trouble
some here? Suppose that, after eating
the weevils, they should spread over
the whole Mississippi Valley, forcing
their way into houses and driving the
inhabitants into exile In the woodshed?
Supposing that they mine the wood of
buildings so that the buildings come
down in a cloud of sawdust? Suppose
a whole lot of things that may not
happen, but that also may, for mis
chiefs came as a result of Importing
the English sparrow, the gypsy moth,
the Hessian fly and the potato bug.
This will require a new parasite to de
stroy the moth. In the West Indies
they introduced the deadly serpent, the
fer de lance, to kill off the rats. Then
they had to introduce the mongoose to
kill off the fer de lance. Now they are
introducing firearms to kill the mon
goose. Men's attempts to upset the
balance of nature in their own interests
are liable to react against them if the
attempts succeed.â Brooklyn Eagle.

The precision of the performances of
these wonderful automatic submarines
may be Judged from the fact that ac
cording to the latest experiments, the
widest range from the line at a ranee
of 3000 yards was not more than twelve
yards, in spite of the strong currents
which prevail on that part of the At
lantic Coast. This means that if a
torpedo were aimed at the center of a
battleship 3000 yards away it would
probably hit it ten feet below water,
and within thirty-six feet of the spot
aimed at. As a battleship Is usually
more than 300 feet long, there is room
for a deviation even greater than this.
Under favorable sea conditions, how
ever, the torpedo may be relied upon to
strike within a yard or two of the spot
at which it was aimed, provided that
the aim be good.
The selling price of a finished tor
pedo is about Â£500, writes a cor
respondent of the Chicago Chronicle.
Not one Is put on the market without
having been exhaustively tested at
Messrs. Whitehead's running: station,
which is connected by a kind of jetty
with the works. The station is â¢ pro
vided with two torpedo tubes made to
admit either a gunpowder cartridge or
a charge of compressed air to drive the
torpedo forward. As soon as the mis
sile has taken the water it proceeds
by the help of its own propellers to
ward its goal, and men stationed on the
rafts moored at various distances from
the running, stations are able to see or.
hear the torpedo pass below them and
to signal with a flag the moment of its
passage to the controller, who stands,
chronometer in hand, at. the running:
station. Nets are stretched in the
water near each raft, and as the tor
pedo has to cut its way through them
it is possible to tell by the hole in the
nets whether the torpedo has varied in
depth or direction.

NOT SO HIGH CONSIDERING
Innumerable miracles were wrought
by the agency of the head of the saint,
and In such estimation was the relic
held that regular pitched battles were
fought for its possession. In 1411,
while the head was being carried in
procession, certain unruly Florentines
attacked the cortege, but they were
successfully repulsed by the Romans,
who were led by the Prince Colonna
of the time. After this, fearing that
the precious object might be lost, the
Popes ordered that it was never to
leave the Church of San Silvestro, and
It remained there until 1S70, when
Rome was besieged by the troops of
Victor Emmanuel. It was then car
ried by the order of Pius I to the Vati
can. The present Pope, however,
thinks that there can be no danger la
returning the relic to its ancient rest
ing place. The holy head is contained,
in a valuable silver reliquary, weighing
over 100 pounds. â Rome correspond-*
ence of the London Telegraph.
The English Catholic colony here is
considered to have been specially fa
vored by the Pope. It received his
Holiness' seasonable compliments un
der the form of the restitution to their
Church of San Silvestro of a relic
which is claimed to be unique. It is, ia
fact, quite independently of its reli
gious value, a most interesting and im
portant object because of it3 history
and the traditions which cluster
around it.
Highly honored and truly fortunata
may that church claim to be which
shelters the authentic head of St. John
the Baptist. That is the gift which
the Pope has Just bestowed upon tha
Church of San Silvestro. According
to a tradition ten centuries old, the
head which was demanded by the
daughter of Herodias as a reward for
her dancing, was carried from Palea
time to Rome. It reached the Eternal
City a thousand years ago, being
brought by certain Greek monks, who
deposited It in the Church of San Sil
vestro in Capite, which at that tima
was a monastery.
Head of John the Baptist Returned
to Church Which Held It
in 1411.
POPE ORDERS RESTORATION
OF LOXG LOST RELIC
It is officially reported that tha
bandits, of whom there were four ac
cording to the best information, en
tered the express car and took there
from four packages, one containing $21.
another $7, third not known to contain
money, and. a package of railroad
tickets. Fireman Roy Milton, who was
hurt in jumping from his engine, la
not seriously injured. The country in
which the hold-up occurred Is filled
with timber and thick underbrush.
HOUSTON. Tex.. July 16.â One ar
rest has been made in connection with
the International and Great Northern
train robbery at Spears late last night.
This suspect, whose name 13 not
known, declares his Innocence. Sheriff
Watts of Anderson County and a posse
have been at work all day tracking
the bandits. Ranger Cantain McClel
land got orders to proceed to the scene
and has arrived at Oakwoods.
There is, however, a considerable
discrepancy shown by the official esti
mated figures of the previous fortnight,
the latter indicating a gain of $17,500,
000, while the official statement shows
only $1,250,000. Taking the last three
weeks together the total of the esti
mated Increase is $29,500,000, while that
of the actual gain is $15,000,000.
Bank averages for the three weeks*
period, therefore, are still $14,600,000 be
low the presumably actual movement
as shown by the traceable changes.
The deposits were Increased $21,019,100
last week, or $2,005,200 less than the
sum of the gain In cash and the in
crease in loans, hence the statemenr
does not balance. The require* reserve
against general deposits was $5,254,775,
deducting which from the gain in cash
leaves $8,545,625 as the increase in* sur
plus reserve to $44,563,250. Computed
on the basis of deposits less those ' of
$23,323,100 public funds the surplus
is $50,394,130. The loans expanded
$5,223,300, probably due largely to bond
negotiations and also to borrowings
by commission houses.
It is noteworthy that the totals are
the highest ever reported and that c%ish
and deposits show new high records.
The daily average of bank clearings
last week was $211,000,000, or $4,000,000
less than the previous week.
NEW YORK, July 16.â The Financier
this week says:
The striking feature of the New York
Associated Banks' statement was the
comparatively close correspondence be
tween the average increase In cash
and that which was estimated from
the traceable movements of money
during the week, the officially reported
increase being $13,800,400. while that
which was estimated was $12,077,000.
CALL BUREAU, HOTEL BARTON,
WASHINGTON, July 16.â Engineer
Lippincott, who has charge of the
reclamation work in California, haa
transmitted his report on the opera
tions In that State for the month of
June to the Geological Survey. Three
large projects are now under consid
eration In Californiaâ Yuma, Owens
Valley and Sacramento River â
and general investigation is being
made of the basins of the Klamath
River. Plans and specifications for the
Yuma project are in course of prepara
tion, as well as a map Bhowing the
number of acres that have been signed
up under this project. The field work
In connection with the Owens Valley
project is progressing rapidly under
the direction of Engineer Clausen.
The total discharge of the rivers of
this valley have been computed and
stream-gauging explorations for reser
voir sites and examinations of bed
rock are in propress. Field parties are
making investigations of possible reser
voir sites in the Sacramento Valley and
collecting data for a general report
containing, a compilation of all avail
able statistics relative to drainage of
the basin of the Sacramento River.
It Is the desire of Lippincott in pre
paring this report to make It an au
thority for all data relative to engineer
ing conditions in the Sacramento Val
ley and to draw some general conclu
sions therefrom relative to forestry, ir
rigation and overflow. In view of the
fact that during February last 800,000
acres of that valley were overflowed
by the storm waters of that stream,
the data collected by the reclamation
service will be of great value in the
work of bringing about better condi
tions in that section.

True Laziness.
President Clowry of the "Western
Union Telegraph Company holds that
laziness, more than alcohol or any
thing else, is responsible for the fail
ures that men and women make of
their lives.
"Take the tramp," said President
Clowry one day. "What is the tramp's
dominant trait? Is It not laziness?
You may say the tramp Is fond of
liquor. Well, I answer that he is
fonder of idleness. He could awlm in
liquor if he would work for it. But
he will not work.
"All failures are lazy. But the lazi
est failure is the tramp. A tramp
knocked at the back door of my
cousin's farmhouse in Vermont one
hot afternoon.
" 'Lady,' he said to the cook, 'will
ye spare a poor fellah a drink of wa
ter?*
" 'Certainly.* she answered. "Here's
a tumbler, and there's the pump.*
" Thank you, kindly,' said tha
tramp. 'And now, if you'll Just work
the handle we shan't be long.' " â Ne*

insure hlB house. I was all attention,
and after getting a minute description
of the building found that it was in' a
village in the remote part of an ad
joining county. I was unacquainted
with local conditions, so I said to him:
" 'Now, before writing this policy, tell
me, do you have any fire protection in
your town*'
" 'Well, yes.' he drawled.
" Fire company, I suppose?'
" 'Well, no; not as I've heard of

" 'Well, it rains sometimes.'

FERRAL PLEADS
FOR MURDERER
Assistant District Attorney
Says That William Buck
ley Is aii Innocent ' 3Ian
The unusual spectacle of an Assist
ant District Attorney ' making an im
passioned plea on behalf of a convicted
murderer was witnessed in Judge Law
tor's court yesterday. Â»The murderer
was William BiTckley. He was con
victed of shooting and killing George
W. Rice, a non-union machinist, at
Twentieth and Howard streets on Oc
tober 11, 1901, during the strike of
the iron workers. He was sentenced to
be hanged, but an appeal was taken
to the Supreme Court for a new trial,
which was denied about a month ago.
Attorneys Ferral and Murphy repre
sented Buckley at the trial and a few
months later Ferral was appointed As
sistant District Attorney. When Buck
ley appeared before Judge Lawlor for
resentence yesterday Ferral, ln the
capacity of his counsel, made the im
passioned plea on his behalf.
"It would be Judicial murder, it
would be monstrous," said Ferral, "to
send this man to the gallows, as he is
John Wilson, alias "Shy Red,** alias
"Toughy," one of the most desperate
criminals ever confined ln Folsom
ptnilertlary. Is anxious to secure ihe
services of an attorney to obtain his
freedom on the plea that he has be*n
Illegally deprived of his liberty. On
liarch 18 last he was sent from the
penitentiary to the State Hospital for
the Insane at Stockton. His desire
for a release was made known by a
note he dropped from the window of
his cell a few days ago. which was
picked up by William Hynes, a resi
dent of this city, who happened to be
passing the window at the time.
CO>TEXTS OF THE NOTE.
The note reads as follows:
"To the finder: Stockton State Hos
pital. Please Inform an attorney at
law that I wish to engage an attorney
and that I can obtain money to defray
expenses If services are rendered. I
have a clear case that I am not either
legally confined here or legally treat
ed or humanely treated while here.
Let him ask for John Wilson or "Chi"
Wilson, ward 6. Please don't let the
hospital officials get wise to this note
end oblige. I will pay for legal ser
vices on another question pertaining
to a conviction of crime and Impris
onment that Is illegal."
WILSON'S RECORD.
Wilson and John Smith were con
victed ln Judge Wallace's court on
Jlarch 4, 1895, on two charges of rob
bery and on March 8 were both sen
tenced to serve twenty years ln Fol
eom penitentiary on each charge,
forty years each. They and William
Fraser held up and robbed J. H- Witte
of 1600 Bush street on the night of
January 11, IS 9 5, and R. C. Morton of
â¬02 Central avenue the following
night. Each robbery was accom
panied by violence. At that time Wil
son was 17 years of age, Smith 19
end Fraser 16. Fraser was tried first
end convicted, but on February 25,
while ln the City Hall on his way to
court to be sentenced, he escaped from
the deputy sheriff who had him in
charge and has not been heard of
eince. Smith, after being convicted on
the first charge, pleaded guilty to the
eecond. They were a bad trio and
were suspected of other robberies.
On May 19, 1S99, Wilson's case was
brought to the attention of the Pris
on Directors by the Warden, recom
mending that he be sentenced to sol
itary confinement for the balance of
his term. Wilson, the Warden said,
was one of the most danperous con
victs in the penitentiary. He had
broken every one of the prison regu
lations, losing all of his credits. He
had been punished seventeen times
and had been 44 3 days In solitary con
finement. The previous March he had
attempted to murder another convict.
The directors agreed to comply with
the Warden's recommendation.
Wilson began to show signs of men
tal aberration and on March 18 last
he was taken from the penitentiary to
the State Hospital for the Insane at
Stockton.
