Has a Conference With
Secretary Morton.
Opposed to Giving the Proposed Power

Commerce Commission.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 13. â"I wish to
emphasize this particular point in re
gard to railroad rate legislation at this
time. It is a very delicate period in
the business history of this country to
tamper with legislation affecting the
great common carriers," said James J.
Hid, president of the Northern Pacific,
to-night. Hill has been in Washing
ton for two days in consultation with
the members of Congress and the Cab
inet officers. He spent a large part of
yesterday afternoon in the Capitol with
the Senators and to-day, in company
with Samuel Spencer, president of the
Southern Railway, he had a conference
with Secretary of the Navy Morton.
. This conference, though altogether
informal, was of the utmost impor
tance. Hill represented the J. P. Mor
gan railroad interests. Spencer said
to-day that he spoke for seventy-five
per cent of all the railroads in the
countiy. It was said that only railroad
legislation and the tariff were infor
mally discussed at the conference. One
statement tan be made on authority:
Neither of the railway presidents could
he brought around to President Roose
velt's view that the powers of the In
terstate Commerce Commission should
be increased to include rate control.
HMI said:
1 legislators should proceed with
the utmost care. It is a very impor
tant question, but it is a critical time
to discuss it, or, rather, to agitate any
new Ft-deral regulations for common
carriers."
"Dobs this mean that you and your
friends will oppose any kind of rail
road k-gislation at this time?" was
asked.
â¢ "1 will not only not oppose, but I will
welcome any legislation that will stop
every .-ingle railroad rebate and I know
of no ra|lroad man in this country who
will not do the same," Hill replied.
"Will the shippers oppose this?"
"Of course they might," said Hill.
FIGHTS HERD
OF SEALIONS
Al Wyber Infuriates Animals
by Injuring One With Gun
While It Is Chasing Fish
ALAMEDA, .Inn. 13.âMaddened sea
lions, made so by the wild actions of
one of their number, which had been
wounded by Al Wyber. caused the herd
to atta.-k the frail craft of the hunter
yesterday. It was only after a desper
ate battle with the infuriated marine
.beasts that Wyber them off and
rowed his hunting skiff to the beach. In
his fight Wyber used his gun and oars
effectively, shooting and striking when
ever an opportunity presented itself.
The hunter was sculling in quest of
ducks when he pncounteif-d a herd of
seallons that had come in close o the
shore and in shallow water in eager
pursuit of a school of Spanish mackerel
and herring. The animals were all
around his boat capturing the fish.
Fearing that they might upset his little
vessel Wyber sought to scare the sea
lions away by peppering one of the
beasts with shot. Instead of stamped
, ing the herd the injured sea lion seemed
to arouse his mates to a fury and the
way they bumped and rocked Wyber's
duck boat made him wish he had never
begun the struggle. When he reached
the shore he was exhausted from fright
and exertion.

Publicly Accuses Him ol
Betraying the Inter

Suit to Be Brought to Restrain Goth
amite From Taking His Seat
in the Halls of Congress.
NEW YORK, Jan. 13.âAt the meet
ing of the Postal Progress League in
Cooper Union to-night Chairman Post
of Battle Creek, Mich, said he had pre
pared papers and would ask the Su
preme Court of the United States, for
a restraining order to prevent Senator
Thomas C. Piatt from taking his seat.
He said he would take this action on
the ground that Senator Piatt sub
verts the interests of the people he
nas sworn to represent in the inter
ests of a corporation he really repre
sents.
Post made his announcement Â»in a
speech entitled "Our Errand Boy."
After having referred to the postal de
ficit and the fact that the people erf
the country pay annually to the rail
roads ?40,000,000, Post said:
'"Senator Thomas C. Piatt of New
York is president of the United States
Express Company. Word was passed
around to other Senators that no defi
nite action should be taken on the post
check money bill. Senator Piatt was
approached by my representatives to
know his attitude on the question, and
he clearly defined the fact that he was
opposed to the measure because it was
contrary to the lntefests of the express
companies. In other words, after hav
ing taken the oath of office to represent
to the best of his ability the people of
New York., he igjnijpeÃ thek
<>r the interests of the public where
those interests conflict with his own
company's and would directly affect
his own earnings. In still further words,
he is drawing two salaries, one from
the express company and the other
from the peouje.
"We met strong opposition from
a New York statesman in a position to
lay some heavy blocks in front of the
wheels of progress, Ellis H. Roberts,
Treasurer of the United States.
"I have papers already prepared and
will ask the Supreme Court at Wash
ington for a restraining order to pre
vent Senator Thomas C. Piatt of New
"York from occupying his seat in the
United States Senate on the grounds
that he does not fulfill his duties ac
cording to his oath of office; that he
subverts the interests of the people
whom he has sworn to reDresent to
the interests of a coporation Which he
represents. It is possible that
the Supreme Court may not grant this
restraining order. We shall make an
uigent effort for it, however,"
After the meeting closed in answer to
questions. Post said tnat his lawyers,
D. E. Dawson and Nathan Wilson,
would present the matter against Sen
ator Piatt to the United States Su
preme Court next week, but would not
specifs the day.
DEATH CLAIMS
OLD HIGHBINDER
Dictator of Los Angeles
Chinese Dies While on a
Visit to San Francisco
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 13.âAh Mow,
the one time terror and boss of Los
Angeles Chinatown, is dead in San
Francisco. His death removes the most
picturesque and powerful Chinese ever
known here. He was an old highbinder
chief who constantly held other men's
lives in the hollow of his hand and was
head of the Hop Sing Tons- His friends
here believe he was poisoned, as on a
recent visit to San Francisco an at
tempt was made to assassinate him.
Ten years ago Ah Mow was the ab
solute dictator in Chinatown, with
Charley Ah Him as his adviser. The
two wore mailed shirts and traveled
with bodyguards. Mow owned an
opera-house, had a great gambling
monopoly and was worth $100,000. Re
cently he went on a tour of the State
selling stock in the Hop Sing Tong
house to be built in Dupont street, San
Francisco. He collected funds enough
and a site was bought. The Chinese of
hiF tong are said to have had a grudge
againpt him because he held up the
owner of the property for a commis
sion, thus "making a haul at both
ends."

WASHINGTON, Jan. 13.âImportant
action with reference to the Panama
canal was taken to-day by the admin
istration. The entire work was placed
by the President under the supervision
of the Secretary of War, and the Presi
dent in a message to Congress advo
cated cutting down the commission
from seven to three or five members.
One of these members was named as
administrative officer of the canal strip,
and he will have combined with his du
ties that of United States Minister to
Panama,
The President's action was taken.be
cause of the recommendations made by
Secretary Taft, whom the President as
signed to visit the Isthmus and make
an investigation into the operations of
the commission. The Secretary found
that a commission of seven under the
plan of organization was clumsy and
not elastic.
A plan was mapped out by the Presi
dent in his message under which the
engineer in charge is to be advised by
other engineers, but is not to be ham
pered in his plans by the commission.
The commission, as revised by act of
Congress, is to have charge of the work
of auditing, etc., but w ill not be per
mitted to interfere with the engineer
or consulting engineers.. The FfesMent
be not limited to the engineer corps of
the army and navy.
Secretary Taft in his report to the
President deals with the Panama Rail
road, which Is owned almost entirely
by the United States Government.
This railroad has a contract with
the Pacific Mail Company, the ma
jority of whose stock is owned by the
Southern Pacific Company, under
which it issues through bills of lad
ing and regulates freight rates so that
they do not interfere with the trans
continental railroads. This places the
United States in the position of being
in a combination which wipes out
competition. The Secretary says that
he believes that this contract is illegal
under the laws of Panama, that it is
against the public good for the United
States to be a party to such a con
tract and advises that the United
States give the Pacific Mail six months'
notice of its intention to withdraw
from it.
Joseph L. Bristow, Fourth Assist
ant Postmaster General, to-day ten
dered his resignation to the President,
to tack effect on January 20. By an
executive order issued late this after
noon President Roosevelt designated
Bristow as a special commissioner to
make an investigation into the present
trade conditions and freight rates be
tween the Atlantic and Pocific coasts
and between the west coast of South
America and the east coasts of the
United States and of Europe to deter
mine the best policy of managing the
Panama Railroad.
The announcement came at the con
clusion of an extended conference to
day of the President, Secretary Taft,
Bristow and Senator Long of Kansas.
The order issued by the President says
in addition to the foregoing:
"He is authorized to employ for this
purpose a stenographer at not exceed
ing $5 a day and his actual and neces
sary expenses and to take evidence of
all persons whose knowledge of trade
conditions or rates will assist m s
reaching the necessary conclusion.
"Until his report is forthcoming the
Commissioner will be allowed his.
actual expenses and $15 a day. The
President will, finally fix his entire
compensation. The Isthmian Canal
Commission is directed to provide the
funds needed in the execution of this
order."
After the conference at the White
House Senator Long said that the
transfer of Bristow from the Postofflce
Department to work in connection with
the proposed isthmian canal had been
under consideration for a long time.
"Secretary Taft." said the Senator,
"desired to utilize Bristow's services In
connection with the work of construct
ing the canal, and has had the idea in
mind of appointing him a commissioner
to investigate the trade and freight con
ditions ever since he returned from the
isthmus of Panama. The President
readily acceded to Secretary Taft's
suggestion, and as the work will be
entirely congenial Bristow has ac
cepted the new position."
Bristow has had interviews with the
President and Secretary Taft regard
ing the affair, but his final determina
tion was not reached until to-day. His
decision to accept the special commls
slonership was hastened. It Is said, by
the transfer yesterday of the division
of postofflce inspectors from the bureau
of the Fourth Assistant Postmaster
General to the direct control of the
Postmaster General himself.
Bristow regarded the issuance of the
order to transfer the division as a re
flection on him. That the order as to
the inspectors' division was not issued
with the idea of humiliating Bristow
is evidenced by the President's action
to-day.
PANAMA. Jan. 13.âThe suggestion

Special Dispatch to The CatL
GALESBURG. Mich., Jan. 13.â
Through the discovery of a diamond
ring circling the tail of the family cat
owned by William Ward of this city
steps were taken to-day to secure the
release from the State Reformatory of
William Henderson, sent there two
years ago on the charge of stealing the
ring. The ring mysteriously disap
peared from the dressing table of Mrs.
Ward two years ago, and, despite- a
thorough search, remained missing un
til to-day. when it was discovered. A
visitor, playing with the cat, acci
dentally found the ring concealed In
the long hair of the cat's tail. The
supposition is that a child in the Ward
family, while playing with the cat,
slipped the ring over pussy's tall, where
it was held by the hairs becoming en
tangled In the prongs which held the
diamond In position.

BETTER HOMES
FOR WORKMEN
Henry Phipps Is Preparing
to Erect Improved Tene
ment Houses in New York
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK. Jan. 13.âWith a gift
of $1,000,000, the anouncement of which
was made to-day, Henry Phipps, a
lifelong friend and associate of An
drew Carnegie, and one of the directors
of the United States Steel Corpora
tion, has established a fund for the
erection of improved tenement houses
for the working clases of New York
and for the general betterment of the
tenement house situation.
Phipps says: "I propose to give
$1,000,000 for this purpose. I expect the
tenements to be so planned as to earn
about 4 per cent on their cost, after
allowing a proper amount for main
tenance and. repairs. 1 intend to have
the earnings accumulate and to use
them from time to time in the erection
of more tenements. My wish is that
the rooms should not be rented at a
price below the market rate. I do not
wish to discourage individual investors
from building tenements on a purely
business basis. To do so might check
building operations, raise rents and in
the end prove Injurious to the working
people.
"I should like the buildings to have
all the light and air possible, to have
them fire-proof and thoroughly sani
tary, and, so far as possible, have
spaces around them in which the chil
dren could play."

Report That J. P. Morgan Is
to Go to the Assistance
of the Catholic University
Special Dlepatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 13.âPersons
who were involved in the failure of
Thomas E. Waggerman, treasurer of
the Catholic University of America,
and the friends of that institution
have been much encouraged by re
ports that J. P. Morgan would come
to the aid of the institution. Eight
hundred thousand dollars would
straighten out the complex tangle
caused by Waggerman's investment of
the university funds. That sum would
also save from great losses many peo
ple who saw the savings of their life
time swept away and entangled in the
maze of litigation which followed the
crash.
Rosier Dulany, the trustee named by
the courts, said that he had heard
the reports that Morgan might assist
the university, but he knew nothing
officially nor was he aware of the
source from which the reports ema
nated or whether they were reliable.

READING, Pa., Jan. 13.âAfter pro
longed sessions It has been decided that
the charges against Bishop Talbot of
the Central Pennsylvania diocese of
the Protestant Episcopal church made
by Dr. Irvine will not now be inquired
into. However, it is reported that Dr.
Irvine will make another effort to
bring about an official investigation.
Of the sixteen members of the board
of inquiry eleven were in attendance.
After the session began the gates
leading to the Wood Chapel of Christ
Church, where the meeting was held,
were locked, and strict instructions
were given that no member of the
board was to be disturbed or called out
by any one. This indicated that the
session would be secret and that the
desire of Dr. Irvine to have the meet
ing public would be ignored. Morning
and afternoon sessions were held. At
times the discussions and debated wero
animated, but it is said that the find
ing of the board was unanimous.
Between the sessions the members
of the board who had been accused of
bias in Rev. Dr. Irvine's letter of last
night were interviewed. They treated
the matter lightly and refused to at
tack him in a similar vein. The board
finally adjourned early to-night. Later
Rev. Dr. Bodine, the president, gave
out a statement embodying the pro
ceedings and conclusions of the board.
The statement says:
"After serious and protracted discus
sion and consideration the eleven dep
uties present unanimously reached the
following conclusion:
"The deputies present are bound
themselves to take knowledge of the
facts concerning the clerical deputation
from New York and now formally
brought to their attention by the lay
deputy from New York. Upon those
facts the constitution of the board to
make a preliminary inquiry into the
charges above mentioned is lacking in
canonical authority: and the canonical
n*#fe< t ln-volve* an error so mat* rta.l as
to render it Inexpedient and improper
for the deputies present to assume to
organize or to act as a board to make
preliminary inquiry Into the same
charges."
The error consisted of {Â£â¢ drawing of
Rev. Dr. Dix of New YeJMc as a member
of the board of inquiry, although he did
not sit In the last general convention,
and also that the list of clerical depu
ties from New York, from which Dr.
Dix and Dr. Nichols wWe drawn to
serve as members of a board of in
quiry, either failed to Include the
names of the other three clerical depu
ties from New York, who actually sat
in the convention, or cisc included the
names of five presbyters as clerical
deputies, whereas under the constitu
tion of the church there could not be
more than four clerical deputies from
one diocese at any one time. In either
case the list from which such names
were drawn was not a list of the depu
ties to the last general convention as
required by canon.

an Inquiry Into the Fund

NIEDBINGHAUS' (HECK
Efforts to Prove That the
Donation of Senator To
Be Came From the Brewers
ST. LOUIS, Jan. 13.âThe Senate and
House committees of the Legislature,
appointed to investigate the statement
of campaign receipts and expenditures,
filed by Chairman T. K. Niedringhaus
of the Republican State Committee,
who*is the Republican caucus nominee
for United States Senator, met separ
ately to-day. The hearings were open
to the public.
The closest investigation was di
rected into the charge contained in the
resolution of Representative Oliver
Grace, that the $21,000 reported by
Chairman Niedringhaus In his own
name was in reality contributed by the
brewer interests of St. Louis.
Among the first witnesses summoned
to appear were Chairman Niedring
haus, Adolphus Busch, Otto F. Si if el,
S. D. Morris of the speakers' bureau
during the campaign. Secretary Joseph
McCoy, in charge of the organization,
and Chairman J. D. Howe of the Re
publican City Committee.
Niedringhaus appeared before the
House committee, which took a recess
to enable him to frame a reply to the
Grace resolution.
William P. Llgluholder, Deputy Re
corder of Deeds, appeared before the
Senate committee in answer to a sub
pena ordering him to produce a certi
fied copy of the expense account hied
by the Republican State Committee.
He took the original copy, which show
ed as its largest item the lump sum
of $21,231, contributed by Niedringhaus.
The next largest sum was $5000, cred
ited to R. C. Kerens. The total of the
contributions was given as $57,183 75.
The report was filed by T. K. Nied
ringhaus, acting treasurer.
C. E. Brockmeyer, publisher of the
Missouri Star, who was a clerk at the
headquarters, gave testi
mony relating to the charge that St.
Louis breweries contributed the $21,000
which Chairman Niedringhaus of the
Republican Slate Committee credited
to himself in his report of the receipts
and expenditures of the campaign. He
testified that Adolphus Busch, a prom
inent brewer, had given Niedringhaus
at one timt before the election a check
for $2500 and at another time $5000 and
that he contributed $5000 after the elec
tion toward the liquidation of the defi
cit which existed.
Chairman Niedringhaus told him, he
said, that Otto Stifel of the St. Louis
Brewing Association had arranged to
contribute an amount equal to that
given by Busch.
After waiting several hours for the
appearance of Niedringhaus, the Sen
ate investigating committee appointed
a sub-committee to wait upon the
House committee and induce Niedring
haus to come before it.
Chairman Tubbs of the House com
mittee, however, announced that Nied
ringhaus was subject to the orders of
the House committee and he refused to
allow him to appear before the Senate
committee until the House body was
through with him.
Previously the Senatorial committee
had issued a subpena for Niedringhaus,
but the ofhjaers intrusted with its ser
vice could notiflnd him.

FIND INFERNAL MACHINE
IN TELESCOPE BASKET
Philadelphia Police Arrest Supposed
Insane Man, Who Was Carrying
Instrument of Destruction.
PHILADELPHIA, Jan. 13.âA man
â who gave his name as Gessler Resseau
was arrested to-day at the home of
John Kelly, brother of Owen Kelly,
who mysteriously disappeared some
time ago, and a telescope basket he
carried was found to contain an infer
nal machine, wrapped in a Washington
newspaper. He is .believed to be de
mented and was committed to prison.
Kelly told the police that Resseau had
offered for $500 to take him to his
missing brother. Owen, in New York.
The man's peculiar actions aroused
Kelly's suspicions and he telephoned
for the police. When Resseau's basket
was examined the infetnal machine,
consisting of clockworks, dry cells,
wires and about fifty dynamite caps,
was discovered.
The police are inquiring Into the pris
oner's career. The fact that, the infer
nal machine was wrapped in a Wash
ington newspaper leads the authorities
to believe that he may know something
of the attempt to blow up the statue
of Frederick the Great in Washington,
on Tuesday. His hat, which was pur
chased in Denver, also leads the police
to believe that he may recently have
come from Colorado. He was held
without bail for a further hearing next
Thursday. j

NATIONAL LIVESTOCK
ASSOCIATION LOSES A
HOST OF CATTLEMEN
Packers ire Admitted and Growers Withdraw
Members Who Left Parent Society
Hold a Meeting and Form
New Organization.
DEN VER, Colo., Jan. 13.âThe Na
tional Livestock Association was rent
in twain to-day by the adoption of a
new constitution which admitted the
packers to membership, and provided
an open door through which the rail
roads of the country might at any time
become factors in the control of the
organization.
The cattlemen, horse and swine
growers, together with representatives
of some of the affiliated industries, re
fused to agree to the new constitution,
withdrew when they considered its
adoption probable and this afternoon
formed a new organization under the
name of the American Stock Growers'
Association, whose aim it will be to
wield a dominating influence in the in
terest of the cattle grower.
Roughly speaking, the sheep grow
ers, commission men and the stock
yards interests remained with the Na
tional Livestock Association and the
actual growers of all other animals for
the market have gone with the new
association.
The cattlemen have from the first
strongly opposed the admission into
their organization of the packers, es
pecially of the railroads. They claimed
that these two influences would ulti
mately dominate the cattle growing in
dustry of the country to the detriment
of the individual grower, and they re
fused to remain in an organization
which included their representatives
among the members of its controlling
body.
DEFECTION IN THE RANKS.
The defection in the ranks came after
a long session in which the arguments
were at times torrid and where the par
liamentary tangles were so frequent
and so complex that it was impossible
to follow them. Many of them were
not followed. Motions would be made,
placed before the house and never vot
ed upon. At times there would be sev
eral motions before the house at one
time, and they would all drop together
by the wayside when the convention
went helter-skelter after something
else. Vice President Jastro at one time
acted as presiding officer and declared
out of order a motion to adjourn.
"Ain't motions to adjourn always In
order?" demanded the delegate who
had made it.
"Not Just now they ain't," replied
the vice president, who was anxious to
bring about a vote on the proposed
constitution before allowing the con
vention to adjourn.
At the opening of the convention ma
jority and minority reports were sub
mitted by the committees that had
been appointed yesterday to consffier
the olan of reorganization. The for
mer, which came from the cattlemen,
was read by S. H. Cowan of Texas and
recommended that only stockmen be
admitted jto membership and that all
visiting stockmen be allowed to vote
on the plan of reorganization. It de
clared against a combination with
stockyards, packers or railroads.
The minority report, submitted by E.
R. Grosney of Arizona, was in favor of
allowing only such delegates to vote as
were members of the National Live
stock Association in good standing.
WRANGLE FOR HOURS.
After a wrangle that lasted for hours
and during which the convention wan
dered hither and thither, the majority
report was adopted.
â¢President Hagenbarth of the associa
tion then declared that up to this time
the convention had been of a general
character and not a convention of the
members of the National Livestock As
sociation, who alone could vote on the
adoption of the proposed plan of reor
ganization The courtesies of the con
vention to visiting stockmen, he de
clared, were about to cease and a ses
sion of the association proper would be
held; An effort was then made to call
the delegates of the association *o or
der, but no roll of the members was at
hand and when one was brought it was
incomplete and it required something
more than an hour for the first calling
of the roll.
During an interval of the roll call
Mackenzie of Colorado discussed the
happenings in'the cdhimlttee room. He
declared that President . Hagenbarth
had told him that $40,000 would be 1
necessary to run the association. He
asked where the $40,0001 waa coming
from, and Hagenbarth answered him
by saying the cattlemen would not be
asked to put up one cent of the money.
Mackenzie gave it as his opinion that
if outside parties were putting up the
money they would aim to control thei
organization and he urged the livestock
men to stand together and get Congress
and the President to come to their aid
when it was necessary. i
During Mackenzie's speech President
Hagenbarth ruled him out of order and
ruled that his time had expired, but
other delegates gave him their time
and urged him to continue his remarks.
FORMING A BAD ALLIANCE.
Cowan discussed the proposed amend
ment at some length. He declared that
no section of It was germane to any
section of the constitution it proposed
to amend. The Government was at
this time, he said, investigating the al
leged beef trust and what would be the
effect on public opinion If the cattlemen
formed an alliance with the men who
are being investigated by the Govern
ment?
"President Roosevelt sent a message
here," said Cowan, "saying 'I am with
you!' What is he going to think if we
go to bed with the very men he Is in
vestigating?"
He closed by declaring that If the
plan of organization was passed the
cattlemen must withdraw.
Former Senator Harris of Kansas
spoke strongly in favor of the adoption
of the proposed amendment, asserting
that the stockmen would have as much
power In the organization as anybody
and declaring that Cowan and the cat
tlemen should rather endeavor to elim
inate objectionable features in the
amendment than to adopt secession.
President Hagenbarth moved that the
entire matter be referred to the incom
ing executive committee, with instruc
tions to have both the old and new
constitutions printed six months in ad
vance of the next convention, at which
time it could be considered. The mo
tion was lost by a vote of 206 to 273,
the sheepmen and stockyards Interests
constituting the majority.
W. E. Hughes of Denver moved that
all the visiting stockmen be allowed to
vote. They had been invited, he said,
to attend the convention, had taken
part in the proceedings up to the pres
ent time and now, when the vote was
to be taken, they were toldUhat they
could not vote. He was ruled out of
order by the president, and Cowan ap
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY. JANUARY 14, 1905.
pealed from the decision of the chair.
APPEALS FROM DECISION.
The appeal, after various vicissitudes,
was lost and was not heard of again.
The report of the committee on or
ganization was then read. It recom
mended that the following be entitled
to membership: Cattle, sheep, horse
and swine breeders; pure breed record
associations, stock exchanges, stock
yards, stock feeders, packers and "such
other branches as may be approved by
the central committee."
The basis of representation was rec
ommended to be as follows:
All branches of the industry to be
represented by a committee of persons
engaged in such branches and such
committee to be known as the general
committee of the branch it represents.
Each State livestock association to be
entitled to a maximum of fifty dele
gates, but in no case shall It have less
than ten delegates. Where no general
State organization exists the particular
Interests are entitled to the following
representation: Each State association
and each association of sheep, horse
and swine growers, and every associa
tion of stock feeders, ten delegates;
each pure breed record association a
maximum of ten and a minimum of five
delegates;each stockyards association a
maximum of three and a minimum of
one delegate; each stock exchange one
delegate for every twenty-five mem
bers, with a minimum of three dele
gates; each packing-house interest a
maximum of ten delegates with a mini
munuif two; all official boards of or
ganizations a maximum of five with a
minimum of two delegates.
CATTLEMEN LEAVE HALL.
Each general committee representing
an industry to select one of its mem
bers as a representative in the execu
tive body of the association.
The question of the adoption of the
amendment was then before the house
and as soon as the clerk commenced
the calling of the roll the 'cattlemen
began to leave the hall in large num
bers. Mackenzie announced that he de
sired all the cattlemen to meet at 2:30
o'clock. The new constitutional amend
ment was then carried by a vote of 253
to 60.
At the afternoon session of the Live
stock Association a resolution was
adopted increasing the time limif for
the transportation of livestock from 28
to 36 hours. A resolution was adopted
favoring reciprocity treaties with for
eign countries which have placed a ban
on American livestock as a means of
relieving the glutted condition of the
American market.
The cattlemen who had left the con
vention gathered at the Brown Palace
Hotel in, the afternoon and appointed
a committee of fifteen to present a plan
for a new organization. Its report,
which was unanimously adopted, rec
ommended that a temporary president
be appointed to hold office until May
2, when a general convention for the
purpose of effecting a permanent or
ganization will be held In Denver.
John W. Springer, a former president
of the National Livestock Association,
was elected president until the May
convention.
NEW ORGANIZATION FORMED.
In the new organization the repre
sentation Is to be one of individual
members only, and it will not be an
amalgamation of associations, as is the
case with the older organization.
At a meeting of the National Live
stock Association held to-night the
central committee, which Is the govern
ing body of the association, was an
nounced as follows: H. A. Jastro, cat
tle growers; A. J. Lovejoy, swine grow
ers; Jesse Smith, sheep growers; H.
W. McAfee, horse growers; W. A. Har
ris, Pure Breed Record Association;
Frank Cooper, livestock exchanges; A.
G Leonard, stockyards; Nelson Morris,
packers; C. P. Bailey, goat raisers.
The committee re-elected President
Frank J. Hagenbarth and passed a
resolution thanking him far his work
and expressing confidence in him as
an official.
The minor officers will be selected to
morrow morning.

NEW TESTIMONY
FAVORS SMOOT
Admitted; However, That He
Had Church's Permission
to Seek the Senatorship
OPPOSED TO POLYGA3IY
Gentile Witnesses Take a
Hopeful tiew of Situation
and the Future in Utah
WASHINGTON, Jan. 13.âThree wit
nesses for the defense - in the Smoot
case to-day testified that polygamy was
dying out in Utah so rapidly- that there
was no need of prosecutions. It was de
clared that the younger Mormons are
all opposed to polygamy, and that if
they thought it was taught there woulji
be a revolution in the church. It was
admitted that Senator Smoot got the
consent of the church to become a can
didate for Senator, but only in the form
of a leave of absence from his church
duties, and it was declared, that .he
could have been nominated and ejected
without it.
J. W. N. Whitecotton, an attorney of
Provo, Utah, resumed his review of po
litical affairs in Utah when the"nearing
opened to-day-, in .the Smoot. investiga
tion. The deduction he drew was that
the church did not try to prevent its
members from engaging in politics
without the consent of fhe church, but
that when certain members accepted
important church offices the church
had a" right to prevent Such members
from accepting other offices which
would take their time. The witness
said Smoot had always been opposed
to polygamy.
NOT CHURCH'S CANDIDATE.
"Do you think his apostleship assist
ed or hurt him in his canvass for the
Senatorship?" was asked.
"I do not know as to that. I know
there are a great many Mormons who
opposed him because he was an official
of the church, and I suppose there are
a great many who did not take his po
sition into consideration at all. Then
there may have been some who worked
for his election because he was an of
ficial."
The witness said it never had been
understood that Smoot was the candi
date df the church, but that it was
necessary for him to have the consent
because of his church position or get
into trouble with the church.
At the afternoon session Judge Tay
ler, counsel for the protestants, cross
examined Whitecotton. The witness,
when asked if President Joseph Smith
had said if he observed the custom
which prevailed generally on the sub
ject of marriage relations "he would
bo eternally damned," replied it would
not surprise him, because Smith was
a "thorough fanatic."
SYMPATHY WITH WOMEN.
H. E. Booth of Salt Lake City, a
non-Mormon lawyer, wbÂ» went to Utah
from lowa in 1885 and has been active
in the politics of Utah, asserted that
the Mormon church, as a church, did
not interfere in political affairs, but
that as individuals they took an in
terest in politics in the same way that
other citizens did.
Booth testified that the sympathy
was with the women who were mar
ried in polygamy and that there was
a disinclination to prosecute the polyg
amists for that reason. He said he
thought polygamy would die out soon
of itself and that It was better to per
mit this rather than to prosecute hus
bands and leave their plural wives as
outcasts. He said his observation was
that there had been no plural mar
riages with the sanction of the church
except perhaps the case of Abraham
Cannon. He asserted there would be
an immediate revolution in the church
if the president of it should sanction
plural marriages.
AIDED BY GENTILES.
The witness said that Senator
Smoot's candidates for the Legislature
would have been defeated if it had not
been for the gentiles. There was no
question that Smoot received church
consent to run for Senator, but
he believed Smoot would have been
nominated and elected had that con
sent been refused. He thought if con
ditions were allowed to go on as they
were new, in a few years nothing
would be heard of the Mormon ques
tion.
Booth, in conclusion, insisted that he
had been a constant opponent of poly
gamy all through his residence in Utah,
but said that conditions could not be
changed any more rapidly than they
were changing. Concerning non-prose
cutions, Booth admitted on cross-ex
amination that on both sides of his
home President Smith maintained
houses for his wives, but that until the
Smoot hearing he had never heard that
polygamous cohabitation had been
practiced since the manifesto.
Asked by Senator Dubois if his
sympathy for children born in poly
gamy 'is great enough to put a stop to
bringing them into the world," the
witness replied: "It is, if a stop could
be put to it without vesting penalities
and hardships on those women, who
bring them into the world. If you can
suggest a way to meet this problem I
will adopt it and carry it out."
AMENDMENT NOT NEEDED.
Chairman Burrows asked Booth if
he thought a constitutional amend
ment of the United States prohibiting
polygamy would avail and received the
answer that it was not necessary. The
witness said, however, that he thought
it would put an end to polygamy.
Arthur Pratt testified that he had
served six years as Chief of Police of
Salt Lake City and under the territorial
government he had been United States
Marshal and Deputy United States
Marshal. Angus M. Cannon, the wit
ness said, had a bad reputation and
his word could not be credited.
Pratt said In the three years Joseph
Smith had been president the church
had been kept out of politics, but be
fore that time it had been a factor.
TESTIMONY STIRS STORM.
Idaho Legislators Resent Statements
Made by McConnell.
BOISE, Idaho. Jan. 13.âThe state
ments made by former Governor Mc-
Connell in Washington before the
Senate committee investigating the
case of Senator Smoot have created a
stjr here. McConnell's statement re
lating to the gambling proclivities of
members of the Legislature is espe
cially resented, and to-day the fol
lowing resolution was adopted by both
branches of the State Legislature:
"Resolved. That we, the members
of the Eighth Idaho Legislature, now
in session, regardless of political be
lief or religious creed, denounpe the
statements as reported in the press of
ex-Governor W. J. McConnell before

reflecting on the morals of the Idaho
Legislature as unjust, - uncalled for
and untrue; and further resolved, that

THINKS SWAYNE
IS PERSECUTED
Congressman Littlefield of
Maine Sees Revenge in
Charges Against Judge
MAKES BITTER SPEECH
Parker of New Jersey Asks
for a Separate Vote on
Each of Twelve Articles
WASHINGTON, Jan. 13.âFurther
consideration was given in the House
of Representatives to-day to the Im
peachment charges against Judge
Charles Swayne of the Northern Dis
trict of Florida. There was a notice
able lack-of interest in the case ex
cept among a few members.
IJttlefleld of Maine, referring to the
incompleteness of the report of the
testimony of Judge Swayne, said he
had had a conversation over night
with Palmer of Pennsylvania and Gil
lett of California, his colleagues on
the Judiciary Committee, both of whom
had informed him that the testimony
relating to the Hasklns bankruptcy
case had been so indequately report
ed that they had directed that that
portion of the evidence be not printed,
preferring to allow Judge Swayne an
opportunity at a later hearing to re-,
state the case.
With great bitterness of feeling Llt
tlefield closed bis speech, saying there
had been no hunting or hounding of
Judge Swayne until O'Neal sought to
get his revenge and undertook with his
own weapon to paralyse the arm of
every court that sat. O'Neal, he said,'
was dead, but behind him he had left
that legacy, and a fair construction of
the record showed that O'Neal's friends
were, to an extent, carrying it on.
An earnest plea for a separate vote
on each of the twelve articles of im
peachment was made by Parker of
New Jersey, one of the signers of the
minority report in the Swayne case.
He said that except in the case of
Judge Swayne's expense account the
alleged Impeachable acts complained
of were so old and stale that they
should not now be revived.
The Swayne charges were then laid
aside and the House adjourned.

PENSION BILLS
BEFORE SENATE
Tillman Alleges That His
Constituents in the South
Are Discriminated Against
LONG DEBATE FOLLOWS
Law Relative to the Intimi
dation of Witnesses in Any
Federal Case Is Passed
WASHINGTON, Jan. 13.âThe Senate
to-day passed the legislative, executive
and judicial appropriation bill and also
a number of private pension bills. The
resolutions granting pensions for ser
vice in the Indian police and allowing
gratuities for injuries received by
Workmen while In the employ of the
Government were debated at length.
The consideration of the bill granting
a pension to the families of the mem
bers of the Indian police who were
killed in 1890 in the capture of Sitting
Bull took up considerable time. Till
man made the claim that the Indian
police are on the same footing as the
Philippine Constabulary. He said that
he had made an, effort to get a pension
for the family of a South Carolina man
who was a member of the Philippine
force and who was killed while on duty
there. He contended that there had
been discrimination because his constit
uents were from the South, but Mc-
Cumber, in charge of the bill, said such
was not the case.
"The Senator sees' it that way; he
does not want to see it any other way,"
said Tillman,
McCumber protested that he was
willing to be guided by the facts, to
which Tillman responded that he "dis
puted the Senator's interpretation of
the facts."
After further debate the bill was
passed oveT.
Consideration of the. legislative, exe
cutive and Judicial appropriation bill
was then resumed.
The chair sustained Berry's point of
order against the amendment Increas
ing the salaries of the Civil Service
Commissioners, and the bill was passed.
The statehood bill was not consid
ered*.
Beveridge sought to have a day fixed
for a vote on the bill, but Gorman re
plied that owing to the absence of
many Senators it would be Impossible
to assent t6 the request. Gorman add
ed that there Is no disposition to un
duly delay action on the disposition of
the statehood bill.
Beveridge did not press his point.
The statehood bill was then temporar
ily laid aside.
A bill extending the law relative tp
the Intimidation of witnesses in Federal
courts to witnesses before United
States commissioners was passed.
A bill authorizing the payment of
$3000 to Charles S. Hooper, a black
smith who lost an eye while in the

sion bills, the Senate, after a brief
executive session, adjourned.
EGAN STRAIGHTENS OCT
HIS OFFICIAL. BOND
Commissioner of Works May Procure
Another Surety in Place of M.
A. Murphy, a Non-Reaident.
Commissioner of Works Egan was
busy yesterday straightening out his
official bond, the sureties of which
Auditor Baehr could not find on the
assessment roll. After a conference
with the Mayor, Egan decided to file
affidavits showing tha}, the sureties are
qualified to act for a/ $25,000 security.
Egan says that Edward McGary, one
of his bondsmen, lives at 1036 Mis
sion street and is sole heir to the es
tate of the late Edward McGary.
which exceeds $100,000. M. A. Mur
phy, the other bondsman, is manager
of the Carnegie Brick and Pottery
Company, Carnegie, Alameda County.
Egan appeared at the Auditor's - of
fice with McGary and Murphy. The
latter says he owns property in San
Bernardino County sufficient to secure
the bond. Baehr is undecided as to
whether Murphy is competent to act
under the charter, as he owns no
property in this city and is a non-res
ident. If Murphy 4s not qualified to
set Egan said he would procure an
other surety, adding that he would he
able to do this on short notice.
Edward H. Algeltinger, the new
Commissioner of Works, filed his of
ficial bond with Auditor Baehr, the
sureties thereon being Adolph Spreck
els and Charles Laumeister, both of
whom Baehr believes perfectly qual
ified from a financial standpoint.
BERNARD D. â¢O'CONNELD
IS PLACED ON TRIAD
Grievance Committee of Bar Associa
tion Considers Charges Preferred
Against Attorney.
The grievance committee of the San
Francisco Bar Association yesterday
considered the charges preferred
against Bernard D. O'Connell by At
torney Stephen V. Costello. The de
fendant spoke briefly in his own be
half, after which the question arose
as to whether it would be better to
have Costello present the matter to
the Supreme Court without appeal to
the association. After some argument
the hearing was postponed for one
week.
O'Connell was recently admitted to
the bar of California by the Supreme
Court on motion of Costello. It was
subsequently learned that O'Connell
had served six months in a Massachu
setts jail for attempting to bribe a
Councilman of . the City of Lowell and
that he had been disbarred from prac
tice in the courts of that Btate. When
Costello was informed of the matter
he immediately preferred charges
against O'Connell.

Jail on the charge of murdering Mrs.
Ida Deane of Wilmington, Del. This
has nothing to do with the Dunning
murder, of which Mrs. Botkin has
twice been found guilty and for which
she has been sentenced to life impris
onment at San Quentln.
The prisoner says she has been re
strained of her liberty for more than
sixty days beyond the time when she
should have been given a hearing. She
hopes in this way to escape a trial on
the charge of murdering Mra Deane.
An appeal has been taken from the
judgment in the Dunning case and
that matter is now before the Su
preme Court, which will also consider
the petition for habeas corpus next

Peter Dunne with a handsomely
bound copy of the resolutions that
were adopted by the association soon
after the death of Mr. Dunne, two
months ago. Mrs. Dunne was much
affected by the sympathy extended her

WOULD REVISE CONSTITUTION OF THE STATE
Tobacco Dealers
Fight "Trust"
in Senate.
Special Dispatch to TnÂ« Call.
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 18.âThe first
legislative art in the battle of the San
Francisco tobacco retailers against the
so-called " trust" that has invaded the
metropolis was presented this morning
for the consideration of the upper
House by Senator George B. Keane.
Senator Keane introduced a bill making
It a misdemeanor for any person, firm
er corporation to issue coupons, trading
stamps or paper of any sort represent
ative of property to be given away
upon the fulfillment of contingencies
contained in the provisions of .such
coupons, etc. The bill was introduced
by Senator Keane at the instance of
the Retail Cigar and Tobacco Asso
ciation of San Francisco and is aimed
directly at the "trust," which, It Is
said, intendspto offer inducements in
the line of trading stamps and coupons
that will give it a great leverage in
the retail market of San Francisco.
If the bill is passed it will mean that
the "trust" must find n*>w means for
creating popular demand for its goods.
A measure of great importance to the
barbers of the State will be presented
tiejrt Monday by Benatoi Keane. It will
provide for the establishment of a
State Board of Barbers' Examiners and
wi!l operate in conjunction with the
various boards of health, its principal
object to prevent the spread of
contagious diseases of the face and
scalp. It is also aimed at the so-called
barber i olleges that are- thriving in
San Francisco and which graduate
men a v Journeymen barbers yn the
period of eight weeks. The proponents
of the bill say that in eight weeks a
man car scarcely determine the differ
ence between the most ordinary dis
eases of the skin and that consequently
people that have only had that much
experience should not be allowed to
work at the trade.
SUPPORTED BY FEES.
The commission, if the bill is passed,
will be supported by the fees received
from barbers for the issuance and re
nc-waj of licenses, which must be taken
out once a year at a cost of fifty cents.
The lees collected will be turned into
the State treasury with the result that
the people generally will not be taxed
to maintain the commission. The pro
visions of bill relating to the es
tablishment and remuneration of the
commission follow:
Section sâEach member of Â»aid beard shall
â¢receive a compensation of four (4) dollars
per day for actual services rendered as a mem

Improvement of
Rivers Subject
of Discussion.
Special Dispatch to Tb* Call.
"SACRAMENTO, Jan. 13.âA Joint ses
sion of the Senate and Assembly Com
mittees on River Improvements,
Levees and Reclamation was held this
afternoon for the purpose of hearing
i suggestions regarding needed legisla
; tion from Bufus P. Jennings and
Messrs. Ferris, Woods, Frankenheimer,
I Van Loben Sels, Tatterson and other
; members of the River Improvement
j and Drainage Association.
A bill was presented by Jennings for
| the consideration of the committees
I providing for the appointment by the
I Governor of a committee of three to go
;to Washington to secure the appoint
i ment of a Government board of en
gineers to examine and report upon the
improvement of the Sacramento River
j and to confer with the committee of
j three in event of its appointment. He
i also submitted, a, joint resolution me
! morlalizlng Congress'"to ' appoint the
desired board.
In connection with this bill comes the
interesting Information that In reply to
i a letter 'of thanks sent by Governor
j Pardee to Major H. M. Chittenden, one
'of the eminent engineers that recently
; reported upon the problem of restrain
i ing the waters of the Sacramento and
' San Joaquin rivers, the last named
I gives it as his opinion that the recla
mation of the rich farming lands now
subject to overflow need not of neces
sity await the work of rectification of
the river channel to insure their recla-
I mation.
Major Chittenden in his letter says
: that it will take many years to com
â  plete the channel work, but he says
, that as soon as the channel work Is be
! gun and the work of building and re
! inforcing the levees is under way a
short time at least nine-tenths of the
1 Ipwlands can be reclaimed, and it is
i suggested the increased income derived
Iby the State from these reclaimed
; lands can be used to carry on the con
i struction of the permanent works, that

other house by Assemblyman King of
Napa.
A bill was introduced in the Senate
prohibiting the sale of liquor within
one and a half miles of the home
grounds. The canteen was abolished
by act of Congress and in order to
make the national legislation effective
it will be necessary to close up the
saloons in Yountville. The politicians
who were so earnest in their efforts to
close the canteen are lending no aid
to the movement to close the saloons
adjacent to the reservation.
Vigorous efforts will be made to keep
the home management out of Napa
County politics and it is said that the
Governor and the Lsgislature will make
special efforts to lift the Napa State
Asylum out of the slough of politics.
Among the bills Introduced were the
following:
Committee on Code RevisionâMaking it a
misdemeanor for appraisers to accept fees not
allowed by law; relating to, the accounts of an
executor or administrator after his death;
making it a misdemeanor for any parent,
guardian or other person to upbraid a public

Legislation,
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 13.âA concur
rent resolution was introduced in the
Assembly this, morning asking that it
be set forth by resolution that it was
j the sense of both the Assembly and
the Senate that a measure should be
' submitted to the voters at the next
! general election calling for a convention
)to revise the State consitution. It whl
j require a two-thirds vote of both houses
jto bring about the submission of this
! matter to the electors.
The present constitution of California
; was adopted at Sacramento by a con
: vention that sat from September, 1878,
!to March, 1879. It was approved by the
people the following November and
went into effect in July, 1879.
"The State has outgrown its consti
tution in many leading features," said
a legislator, who is interested in the
â¢ adoption of the Goodrich resolution.
"The constitution was expected es
j pecially to limit the expense of the
! Judiciary', but that is becoming greater
i than ever. An effort was also made
I through provisions incorporated in it
jto make the Supreme Court decide
! cases faster by holding back the saj-
I arles of members as long as there was
I anything upon the docket. This plan
i did not succeed. It was attempted to
govern railroads through a commission
and this was a failure. It was hoped
through it to abolish most all othe>
comniissions and this also failed. There
are more commissions now than ever
and Legislatures are constantly creat
ing new ones to the great expense of
the State."
The Assembly received another batch
of bills and after transacting some
minor business adjourned until 11:30
Monday morning. A majority of the
members took the first trains out of
town and to-night there Is but little
life in Sacramento. Next week thÂ«Â»
legislative pot t will get to boiling in
earnest.
Speaker Pro Tern. Atkinson took his
first try at the chair this morning and
showed satisfactory speed. Speaker
Prescott took the floor to slcond the
acceptance of the report of the special
committee appointed by the last Leg
islature of which he is chairman, and
did not resume the reins for the rest
of the session, giving Atkinson a try
out. Assemblyman McKenney sub
mitted the report, the gist of which
has already been published in The
Call, and It was referred to the Com
mittee on Prisons and Reforms, and
was made the special order for Tues
day.
SIX NEW ATTACHES.
The Committee on Attaches filed a re
port providing for the payment of
work already performed and adding
new members to the pay roll. There
was a mild debate and the report was
adopted. UJie hew appointees are: Gus
Baker and Louis Hoin, committee
clerks at $4 a day , Mrs. A. J.
stenographer at $f>: P. J. Kennedy, por- :
ter at $3 a day; Ed Osborn, gatekeeper
at $3 a day: W. L. Williams, electrician !
at $4 a day.
The practice of druggists prescribing
for patients and selling morphine and I
other drugs to the users of such will be f
stopped if a bill introduced by Cleve
land of Santa Cruz is passed. It pro- ;
vides that any person other than a |
physician who compounds medicines for |
or sells any drug to any person except :
on a physician's prescription shall be
guilty of a "misdemeanor.
Down in Santa Cruz there are some ',
automobillsts who do not understand
the road cars thoroughly and they are
continually scaring horses and running
over roosters and pigs until the prop
i erty loss in that respect is becoming
serious. To save human life and pre
serve the chickens and shoats from de
struction, Cleveland Introduced a meas
ure providing that no one shall operate
a motor vehicle on the public highways
of the State until he has passed an ex
amination showing that he is a com
petent -mauffeur and has paid a license
fee of $10.
LABELING FOODSTUFFS.
Cleveland also introduced a bill that
will bring out the antagonism of many
manufacturers of food products. It
provides that all foodstuffs put up in
cans, botties or packages shall bear
upon the labels a statement of the in
gredients.
Jones of San Francisco introduced a
constitutional amendment providing
that all property of the Polytechnic
High School of San Francisco shall be
free from taxation.
A resolution providing an appropria
tion of $500 to improve the ventilation
of the Assembly chamber wt ; adopted.
"The air in this room is vile and un
healthy." said Stanton. "While the im
. provements to be made with the tfmall
I appropriation may never Denefit the
; members of the present house, it will
! take away some <-f the discomfort from
j our successors."
The $500 asked for Capitol repairs is
j only intended to cover the expense of
employing an expert architect to de
| termine what work is absolutely neces-
I sary. It Is estimated off-hand that sev
| eral thousand dollars will be needed to
put the building's interior into proper
condition.
â¦ PRISON REFORMS.
Assemblyman McKenney at the time
he submitted his report regarding the
State's penal institutions introduced
eight bills covering the recommenda
tions made in the report. These pro
vide for the making of a truant school
for young boys and girls of the Whit
tier Reform School; the turning of the
lone School into a reformatory after
the plan of the institution at Elmlra,
N. V.; the using of San Quentln Prison
for young criminals and those serving
their first terms and Folsom as a place
lof confinement for criminals of the
I worst class, and for the transferring of
I prisoners from San Quentin to lone
i and vice versa.
The bills provide for the intermediate
system of sentencing and for the grad- 1
ing cf prisoners. Those in the first I
grade only will be subject to parole. In
order to suppress the vices now prac
ticed in Folsom and San Quentin a seg
regate system is provided for. An ap
propriation to carry out the segrega
tion scheme, which .will be expensive
and will necessitate enlargement of |
the prisons, will be Introduced later. Jt
is also provided in the bills that the
monthly payments made by the coun
ties for each boy sent to the reforma
tories shall be cut off and the entire
expense shall be borne by the State,
that boys may not at times be sent to
State prison instead of the schools in
order to save expense to the counties.
The following bills ""were also intro
duced:
OTHER MEASURES.
By Drew âNineteen bills codifying and elim
inating old laws that have been repealed but
still encumber the statutes.

Family Reunion on the Train
I LOS ANGELES. Jan. 13.âThe home
j coming of Senator-elect Frank B. Flint
I to-day was m/thing less than a tri
umphant entry to the city which he
had left not many days before as a
private citizen. The reception accord
ed him was indicative of not only his
extreme popularity, but great civic
pride in the fact that Los Angeles will
have a favorite son in the highest law
making body of the nation. Early in
the morning fifty men prominent in
city altairs boarded a special train to
meet the Senator at Santa Susanna.
Earlj as were these citizens there were
three persons who were before them
and who left the city an hour ahead.
Ihese were Mrs. Flint and her little
son and daughter. It was one of the
incidents not the least significant in a
day that will be long remembered by
the new Senator. Those who Journeyed
iar to be the first to greet the Senator
were those who would have- felt none
the less tender had he returned unladen
with honors. There was a happy fami
ly reunion on the train long before any
body else saw Senator Flint.
At the Arcade depot there was a suc
cession of ovations as the Senator,
looking the picture of health and hap
piness, bowing to the plaudits of half a
thousand admirers, stepped from the
second section of the coast line limited
just before noon. A band played '"Hail
to t'.ie Chief," but cheers and repeated
cheers drowned the music. Then
through the streets lined with citizens
began the parade. In the leading car
riage were Senator Flint, Judge Slau
son. Major Klocke and Mayor McAleer.
Just behind fittingly came the men
who dia the real work of electing Flint
SenatorâWalter Parker, John Mott,
Oscar Lawler and Leo Youngworth. j
Then came carriages with others who j
represented different social factions, all ]
united in the common purpose of doing j
Flint honor.
The new Senator was escorted to his I
old law offices, just as a reminder of !
the greatness of the leap he had taken !
into official life. Not every United j
States Senator spans the breach be- !
|Â»Â«-en a practicing attorney and a high j
with a single bound.
This evening a public reception was I
tendered Senator Flint at the Chamber
of Commerce, when Los Angeles o'ffl- |
cially expressed its pride and congratu- j
lations. Many hundreds of citizens fe
licitated the guest of honor.
Senator-elect Flint says that in a few
days, as soon as he has arranged his
personal affairs at home, he will visit
thy navy yard at Mare Island and the
Sacramento River to learn what Is
needed In those localities in the way of
Government appropriations. He will
endeavor in the early stages of his Sen
atorial career to obtain funds for a
public building for San Diego and other
cities of the State of similar size, and
will hasten work on the new postoffice
in Los Angeles by insisting that con
tracts for the. building be let at once,
instead of waiting for additional appro
priations.
Flint is outspoken in his promise to
uphold Roosevelt in the attempt being

BODY OF LOUIS
BADLY BRUISED
Coroner of Napa Tells of
Condition of Lunatic Slain
in Fight With Attendants
NINETEEN RIBS BROKEN
Physician Gives Important
Testimony at Hearing of
3len Charged With Murder
NAPA. Jan. 13.âThe preliminary ex
amination of Attendants T. D. Shana
han and Oscar Retzman of the Napa
State Hospital for the Insane on the
charge of killing Patient Joseph R.
Louis at the Institution on December
25, 1904, was resumed before Justice
McKnight this morning. District Attor
ney Benjamin conducted the case for
the prosecution, and Attorneys F. E.
Johnston and L. E. Johnston appeared
for the defendants.
Coroner R. M. Kyser testified that he
was at the hospital at 10:30 o'clock on
the evening of December 25. and that
he saw the body of Louis lying upon
the floor of room four of ward B, the
body being without clothing. The Cor
oner said he examined the body and
found marks of violenceâtwo E-shaped
bruises on the right abdomen. He said
he placed a buckle on a leather strap
over the bruises and judged that the
wounds had been made by the buckle.
Kyser further said he thought that sev
eral of Louis' ribs were broken.
Dr. L. A. Frary, who conducted the
autopsy on the body of Louis, testified
that he found many wounds and
bruises on the body. There were sev
eral bruises over each eye, he said,
eight or ten bruises on each arm and
five or six wounds on the abdo
men. The latter, said Dr. Frary, were
probably made with a buckle at the
end of a strap used to retain Louis.
Ten ribs on the right side of the body
were fractured, the witness said, and
nine on the left side. There was also a
severe dislocation of the spinal column.
Dr. Frarv stated that the death of
Louis was caused principally by the
dislocation of the spinal column. "The
ribs," said Dr. Frary, "could have been
broken by the attendants using their
knees on Louis while he was prostrate
upon the floor."
Sheriff Dunlap testified that Retzman
told him on December 26 that while he
was feeding Louis in room four on De
cember 25 Louis made a vicious attack
on him. Retzman, said the Sheriff, tes
tified that he struck Louis once and
then called to Shanahan for assistance.
Louis then went oft* into a fit and soon
died.
This afternoon the prosecution closed
its case. The defense presented no tes
timony. After argument by the attor
neys Justice McKnight took the case
under advisement.

ASKS STATE TO ERECT
DESERT GUIDING POSTS
STATE MINERALOGIST HAS PLAN
*
Would Also Have Wells Dug
for Prospectors' Safety.
In the last few years very large
mineral discoveries have been made in
the desert regions of California, in sev
eral counties. The great plant of the
\ellow Aster mine at Randsburg is an
evidence of this. The oil fields in Kern
County are in regions that formerly
produced little except sage brush. The
gem industry of San Diego County has
created in a desert region. Borax,
niter and other products of Death Val
ley have made the State famed abroad
and have brought in many hardy pros
pectors, the precursors of invested cap
ital, from abroad. In Nevada the Ton
opah. Goldfield und Bullfrog districts
are in what would formerly have been
caller 1 , " bad lands."
Within two years prospectors in the
deserts of San Diego, San Bernardino,
Kern and Inyo counties have been more
numerous than ever before. They have
risked death from lack of water and
hiÂ»ve undergone great hardships in
many instances and some have lost
their lives in the engrossing search for
gold. T> make prospecting easier and
so render discoveries of ore on the Cali
fornia deserts more frequent is a prop
osition that has attracted the attention
of Lewis E. Aubury, the State Mineral
ogist.
He said yesterday that he would
submit a bill in behalf of the State
Mining Bureau to the Legislature for
an appropriation to have guide boards
put on the deserts in the counties of
Kern, San Diego, San Bernardino and
Inyo, to point out the way to water
springs and to indicate the distance to
water from each post, tf money is
provided wells will be sunk in certain
places. There is water enough flowing
under the desert. Mineralogist Aubury
says, and wells would save many lives.
Not infrequently in the history of
desert mining in California and else
where, prospectors have been found
choked to death for lack of water
within a few rods of springs, the prox
imity of which they had no means of
ascertaining. The knowledge of such
deaths has deterred many from going
over the deserts.
Souk years ago, in at least one Cali
fornia county, wooden guide boards
were set up. They were eventually
destroyed, either by prospectors, who
utilized them for firewood, or by the
'\ eather. It is now proposed to erect
iron posts with substantial metallic
guide boards firmly attached. Also it
is intended to have a law providing
for fine and Imprisonment as penalties
for disturbing any of the signs.
SMALL SI M IS NEEDED.
The expense of the sign beards and
some wells, so Aubury says, may not
exceed $5000. The State will be asked
for a small appropriation. The work
of putting up the signs and digging the
v eils may properly be effected in part
with the aid of the counties to be bene
fited. Aubury believes there is no
doubt the counties will lend their as
sistance. Only oldtimers now can eas
ily find their way in the deserts. The
new comers, whom it is sought to en
Â»oarage, ought to be of much value to
the Statf as prospectors for the pre
cious and other minerals.
Within the next few weeks an ex
haustive treatise on gold dredger min
ing in this State will be issued from
the office of the State Printer at Sacra
mento. It contains a complete descrip
tion of the industry as it exists and
gives many facts relating to the regions
in which gold dredging has been prac
ticed and referring to others where
little has been done yet except to set
drills to work that the richness of the
soil may be determined. The industry
is increasing so much faster than any
other form of mining in California at
this time that the publication, which
has been prepared under the direction
of the State Mining loiteau, will re of
more than common interest.
Concerning recent operations among
the gold dredgers in the Oroville dis
trict the Oroville Mercury says:
Gold dredging at Oroville is steadily pro
gressing and this field is now the largest and
most important In the world. It Is very prob
able that new land not yet touched by the
dredge or the drill will be opened for work
within the next twelvt months, thus adding
to the terrltorj now l>eing mined.
Host of the dredging for gold in this terri
tory has been along the bed and banks of the
Feather River south of Oroville and within a
few miles of the town. The field has extend
ed on the south to a distance of six or eight
miles and of late has been widening In this
vicinity. not yet touched by the dredge
has been prospected east of the railroad and
of the main road between Oroville and Pa
lermo, and it Is likely that considerable of
this land will be dredged.
It Is thought that land will be dredged near
Garden Ranch along the creek that flows past
that placf. and that other land near Palermo
will sooner or later he worked.
It Is believed that considerable of the so
called higher or upland not touched as yet by
a dredge will before long be tested. There
are now twenty-nine dredges in operation In
this vicinity, and one new one is in course of
construction.
The gold is found in a gravel deposit, and
this gravel Is so loose that except in one lo
cality no blasting has been done.
Where blasting has been resorted to ft in
creases the expense and this extra expense is
estimated at from t% cents to 3 cents a cubic
yard.
The ground dredged is from twenty to sixty
feet. The gravel yields from 10 cents to 30
cents per cubic yard The whole district is
â  estimated to run about 16 cents per cubic yard
Power for the dredgers Is obtained from the
Bay Counties Power Company. It is esti
mated that the cost of digging the gold here
Including all expenses for power and labor,
etc.. Is 6 cents per cubic yard. In some cases
it has coat a trifle lesa than 4 cents a cubic
yard to extract the gold. The cost of labor
and the cost of power about equal each other
They ought to form about one-half the expense
of operating a dredge. Repairs form an im
portant item, as there Is mui-h wear and tear
SCgTT'S EMULSION.
GROWING UP
There's something the mat
ter with the child that fails
to grow up. A child that
grows up too much, however,
without proper filling out of
flesh, is almost as badly off.
Nothing will heir* these pafe,
thin "weedy" children like
Scott's Emulsion. It supplies
the rounding out of flesh and
the rich inward nourishment
of blood and vital organs
which insures rapid growth a
healthy and uniform develop
ment
â on the dredger* machinery, especially of the
; buckets and ladder line.
One great advantage of this kind of mining
lis that careful tests can he made of the gold
!in th- ground before the boat Is built. A se
-1 ries of holes made by drlllln* gives close and
accurate results, showius what the land may
jbe expÂ«?. ted to yield, and w hen tests have
' been made and the ground aiterward dredged
' it has been found that the actual results were
; very closely foretold by the drill. Tests have
i recent I v been mad* near Honcut. twelve miles
from th-ovllle. and it Is probable one or more
boats will be built there. Te*ts have been
made on ButtÂ» f'reek. near Chtco. and it is
expected that new dredgers will be built and
operated there during the present year.

Something may possibly be realised
from the tin mines at Santa Ana from
a new process, according to the Los
Angeles Times, which says in part:
A new hydro-metallurgical process for ores
that may have a great effect upon mining will
be put In operation within a few weeks at thy
Santa Ana tin mines, flity-elght miles from
; Los Angeles. Just across the line in Orange
County. The process Is a local invention of
t General Manager J. 'A. Comer, who has been
at work on it for about fourteen months. The
1 cyanide mill of ten stamps and capacity of
j fifty tons a day haw been changed and
; equipped with the necessary machinery for
putting the new process into actual working
: operation.
The plant is the first of Its kind in the
, world. Its nature is a closely guarded secret.
. Men interested in the company claim that by
n.eans of it it will be possible to extract hun
dreds of dollars' worth of metals where only a
i few dollars' Worth could be had By
the work done In perfecting this process and
testing the ores the presence of about twenty
metals has been discovered. Among others
are platinum, osmium, iridium, nickel, ura
nium, blsqputh and cobalt. Platinum is found
in the ores of the Santa Ana mines to the
extent of over ten ounces to the ton. I.ast
year only 110 ounces was mined In the entire
United States, and ninety ounces during 1903
, The Inventor says: "We have an eight-foot
ledge of tin running 5 per cent of the metal,
which is worth about 28 cents a pound. Tfie
tin is very valuable, and practically none is
produced in the United States. There are un
questionably enormous Quantities of tin In

has been held back by the influence of the tin

OPERATIONS Of SISKIYOU.
The Yreka Journal says regarding re
cent mining operations in Siskiyou
County:
Frank McOee of Denver, who bonded the
Sundown quartz mine in Virginia Bar mining
district for $24,000 from Mr. Kelley and Dr.
Rockey. has paid down the money. The ledge
is located on Dutch Creek, and will be oper
ated on an extensive scale in the near future
by putting up a mill and machinery.
Some San Francisco parties have located
about .120 acres of mining land on Deadwood
Creek, several of the notices covering land
now worked and held by others. The locators
are not likely to get a foothold on claims
owned and worked by local miners.
A good five-foot ledge haa been found In the
end of the long lower tunnel of the Cherry
Hill quarts mine at Cherry Creek, and as far
as prospected promises to yield returns.
GRANDMOTHER OF SMITH
CHILDREN FILES PETITION
Asks for Letters of Administration
I'pon Estate of Her Daughter,
Mother *>f the Heirs.
Ella J. Chasnberlain, the grand
mother of the 'Butter Smith children,
who is now in the Bast but still claims
San Francisco as her residence, added
another complexity to the already
mixed controversy over the heirs and
their property by applying yesterday,
through her attorney, John A. Wright,
for letters of administration upon the
estate of her daughter, Ella Roberta
Wilson Smith. The latter was the sec
ond wife of Butler Smith. The third
wife, Emily May Smith, has already
obtained special letters upon the es
tate and has applied for guardianship
of the children.
Mrs. Chamberlain recites that her
daughter died February 27. 1903, six
days after her son was born, and left
realty worth $99,375, which produces
an income of $300 a month. She says
the entire estate came to Mrs. Smith
from her father and that after her
' daughter died she found an olograph
ic will among the effects. The dis
covery so angered Smith that he or
dered her to leave the house, where
she had been living. She says he kept
the w|ll until July 30 and pretended to
believe that it was not authentic, but
she compelled him to file It by apply
ing to the court for an order. The
will named no executor, but the hus
band was appointed administrator.

WARNING TO
THE POWERS
Notifies Them of the Immi
nent Danger of Uprising*
in China as a Result of
the Japanese Propaganda
FOREIGN INTERESTS
ARE NOW THREATENED
â¦
Should Any Chinese Troops
Move Russia Will Feel at
Liberty to Cross the Liao
| River Into Neutral Zone
ST. PETERSBURG, Jan. 14âRus
sia's formal notification to the powers
of the imminent danger of a general
uprising in China as the result of a
Japanese propaganda, which will
threaten all foreign interests, coupled
with a general protest against China's
repeated violation of neutrality in con
nection with Japanese operations, is
really a warning to the powers that
Russia regards the situation as ex
tremely serious, and holds that the
time has come for joint action by the
powers for the protection of their own
interests. For herself. Russia feels that
Japan has broken the pledge she made
with respect to Secretary Hay's note at
the beginning of the war and further
persistence in this course will, she
holds, absolve her from further ob
servance and leave her free to act for
her own protection.
The present note followed two pre
liminary warnings addressed to the
powers, one in October and the other
in November "neither of which was
heeded." It has an entirely different
ring, setting forth breaches of Chinese
neutrality. Including the Ryeshltelnl
case and also the use of theMiaotao Isl
ands, belonging to China, as a base for
the Japanese fleet; the constant dis
patch of contraband from various
Chinese ports, the employment of Chin
ese soldiers in the Japanese army and
the hiring of Chinese bandits to attack
RuSsian communications. Should Gen
eral Ma or any Chinese troops now
move Russia will feel free herself to
cross the Liao River into the neutral
zone. As for the powers, Russia be
lieves the situation has become serious
owing to the stimulus given anti-for
eign agitation in China by the fall of
Port Arthur.
In diplomatic circles considerable im
portance Is attached to the note, and
in the general opinion it is designed to
induce Secretary Hay to Initiate steps
to bring Joint pressure to bear, in order
to prevent the extension of the zone of
hostilities and to compel China to adopt
drastic measures against the present
agitation in the interior of that empire.
RAIDERS ARE ACTIVE.
Cossack Cavalry Tears u p Railroad
Tracks Near Haicheng.
TOKIO. Jan. 23.âThe bodies of Rus
sian cavalry raiders actively operating
southwest of Liaoyang are evidently
desirous of harassing Japanese rail
road communication and interrupting
the transportation of General Nogi's
army to reinforce Field Marshal
Oyama at Liaoyang.
The Japanese army headquarters, re
porting Thursday, says:
â¢Wednesday, at 10 o'clock in the
morning, a Japanese cavalry detach
ment encountered four companies of
Russian cavalry west of Tangmasas,
southwest of Liaoyang, and fiercely en
gaged them. At 2:30 in the afternoon
the Russians were repulsed with heavy
losses. Subsequently they were rein
forced by several companies of cavalry
and eight guns. The Japanese drew
the Russians to Liuerhpac and engaged
and pursued them. On Wednesday
night a small body of Russian cavalry
reached the railroad line and tore up
the tracks between Anshantien and
Haicheng and Tatcheklao and Yinkow.
They were immediately repaired and
the line was reopened to traffic.
"On Wednesday afternoon 2000 Rus
sian cavalry, with guns, attacked
Newchwang. The Japanese were forced
to retire temporarily, but were rein
forced, attacked the Russians and are
still pursuing them.
"The Russians also attacked Nluchl
atun, but were repulsed." j
A report received on January 12 at i
Imperial military headquarters from 1
the Japanese army headquarters in
Korea says that the Japanese garrison
Si Hamheung recently defeated a de
tachment of the Ninth Siberian Cos
sacks near Honon. The Russians re
created in disorder, leaving nine men
dead on the field. The spoils taken by
the Japanese included two horses and
a number of rifles and swords.
A report received from Field Marshal j
Oyama s headquarters to-day says that
the Russians who have been conduct- |
ing active raiding operations southwest
of Liaoyang evidently belong to Lieu- ]
tenant General Mistchenko's Cossacks.
The report says that the Cossacks,
with the Russian Second Infantry Reg
iment of Railroad Guards and twelve
guns, surrounded the Japanese post at
Nluchiatun, north of Yinkow, on the
line of communications, and assaulted
from the direction of Sanchiatzu. The
Russians were repulsed with a loss of
at least eighty.
In military circles here it is not an
tielpatod that there will be any further |
difficulty with Lieutenant General
Mistchenko's Cossack raiders. It is I
believed that the raiding troops were !
probably limited to those which at- j
tacked Newchwang and Nluchiatun.
There is no evidence to indicate that
the Cossacks were strongly supported. :
Steps were taken to block their retreat,
bllt they evidently found it necessary
to retire as swiftly as they came in :
order to avoid being captured.
RUSSIA ENTERS PROTEST.
-Charges China With Breaking the
Neutrality Agreement.
PARIS, Jan. 13.âRussia's note ad- |
dressed to the powers relative to i
China's breaking neutrality gives what 1
Russia claims to be absolute proof of
Chinese breaches. The three main
complaints are:
FirstâThat the Islands of Miaotao, '
in the Straits of Pechili, opposite Port !
Arthur, have been constantly used by |
the Japanese without Chinese lnterfer- '
ence as a strategical base and as a
harbor for Japanese torpedo-boats.
Second âThat the Chinese army on j
the border has accepted the commands
of Japanese officers.
ThirdâThat Chinese firms have been
constantly working in behalf of the
Japanese, supplying them with provi
sions, military accouterments and gen
eral war stores.
The note lengthily sets forth the de
tails and complains that China has not

FIGHT UNFAIRLY
Surgeon Eastlake, Fresh
From Oriental Battlefields,
Is Passenger on the Doric
DUMDUM BULLETS USED
Medico, Who Served With
Japanese Red Cross Corps,
Criticises Slav Warriors
Among the passengers on the liner
Doric, which arrived yesterday from
the Orient, was Dr. W. D. Eastlake, a
New York physician who has lived in
Japan for a number of years and who
has served through the present war as
a volunteer with the Japanese Red
Cross Corps.
Eastlake was at Chemulpo shortly
after the blowing up of the Variag and
Koreitz, vvas at Seoul when the Em
peror of Korea's' palace was burned; and
was in the field with the Red Cross
Corps in every engagement from the
battle of the Yalu to the fight at Ku
renjo, where he was wounded. As a re
sult of his observations he declares
that the Russians are not fighting fair
ly. That they are using dumdum bul
lets he knows, for more than a few
times, he says, he tias removed the for
bidden missiles from the bodies of
wounded Japanese. He saw four bodies
of Japanese which been mutilated
by the Russians and from other sur
geons heard of numerous similar atro
cities. In one case that he saw the
Russians had gouged out the eyes of a
wounded Japanese.
The Russian soldiers, he says, are
woefully Ignorant. They were told
that if taken prisoners by the Japanese
they would be tortured and killed and
were greatly surprised at the kindness
of the treatment accorded by their lit
tle brown captors. ' If we had known
of this," said a Russian private to
Eastlake, "we should have surrendered
long ago."
Of the Japanese field surgery Dr.
Eastlake speaks highly. He declares
that in both field and base hospitals
during the present war blood poison
ing has been the rarest of .complica
tions. As fighters he thinks the Japan
ese without their equal. "A Japanese
charge is like the tide rising on a
beach. It recedes repeatedly, but where
one wave falls back there are others
to take its place and the advance is ir
resistible."
Eastlake was twice wounded. He
was struck by a spent shell and al
though the immediate effects were not
serious, his heart, he says, is now suf
fering from the blow. At Kurenjo he
stooped over a wounded Russian to
help lift the man on a stretcher. The
Russian was badly wounded but still
strong enough to grab a bayonet which
had been lying at his side, and run it
through Eastlake's ribs. .Eastjake ex

WASHINGTON. Jan. 13.âCount Cas
sini, the Russian Embassador, called at
the State Department to-day to talk
with Secretary Hay respecting the for
mal and general protest made by Rus
sia against alleged violations of neu
trality by China during the present
war. The Embassador had been in

that the full text of the Russian cir

DEFENDS STOESSEL.
Japanese Paper Takes the Part of the
Russian General.
TOKIO, Jan. 13.â1t Is reported that
General Stoessel In saying farewell to
his troops thanked the officers and
men for their heroic defense of Port
Arthur. He said that he considered
the Japanese terms the best that could
possibly be offered and that he was
ready to shoulder all blame If the sur
render of the fortress should be con
sidered premature.
There Is a growing sentiment here
to discourage further criticism of Gen
eral Stoessel's action in damaging the
ships and fortifications at Port Arthur
after his letter looking to the opening
of negotiations for capitulation was
sent to General Nogi.
The Nichl Nlchi to-day authorita
tively says that there is no question as
to the rights of the Russians to blow
up their warships and damage their
guns while negotiations were pending
and it points out that they showed
their good faith by stopping the de
struction of property immediately that
the capitulation compact was signed.
o
Discuss Fall of the Fortress.
LONDON, Jan. 13.âThe corre
spondent at Port Arthur of the Times
says: The total number of soldiers,
seamen and civilians in Port Arthur
at the beginning of the siege was
6f.,000. There are no signs of priva
tion. There was food sufficient for
two months and the surrender of the
Russian garrison is inexplicable.
The Daily Mail's Tokio correspond
ent gives a story to the effect that all
the money in Port Arthurr was divided
among the Juissian officers and when
this was discovered a bitter feeling
arose in the army and navy, which
feeling was largely responsible for the
fall of the fortress.

IRISH PLAYS
ARE MURPHY'S
STRONG SUIT
POPULAR ACTOR WHO WILL BE
SEEN AT THE CALIFORNIA
NEXT WEEK.
A theatrical event of unusual import
ance is the return of the veteran Irish
comedian, Joseph Murphy, to the Cali
fornia Theater next Monday night after
an absence of many years. Murphy has
always had a large rollowing in this
city, due not entirely to his art as an
actor, but to the fact that many years
ago he regarded San Francisco as his
home. Twenty-eight years ago he pro
duced the great play, "The Kerry Gow,"
in this city at the Grand Opera-house,
and has been playing it in various parts
of the country ever since. He had in
his support at that time many players
who afterward became famous stars,
including Annie Pixley, James A.
Herne, James O'Neill, Felix Morris and
Lewis Morrison.
The veteran comedian will remain at
the California for an engagement of
two weeks. The opening play Monday
night will be "The Kerry Gow," and
that for the second week will be "Shaun
Rhue.' These are the only two plays
that Murphy has made a specialty of
for thirty years.
EXTRA STBNOGRAPHERS
MAY NOT TAP TREASURY
Supreme Court Knocks Out Scheme to
Increase Patronage of City's
Police Judges.
The Police Judges of San Francisco
have no right to appoint extra sten
ographers for felony cases according
to a decision rendered by the Supreme
Court yesterday. The two shorthand
experts with which the charter pro
vides the Police Courts are all that
may collect for their services.
R. H. Elder performed the duties of
stenographer in a felony case before
one of the Police Judges. Treasurer
Mt Dougald refused to pay Elder's sal
ary demand and the latter brought
suit to compel him to do so. The Su
perior Court sustained a demurrer to
McDougald's answer and he appealed
to the Supreme Court.
The higher tribunal says the char
ter provisions supersede the section of
the Penal Code on wliich the plaintiff
relied to secure his pay. It is held
that a stenographer is a municipal of
ficer in the case at bar and only such
may be paid as are appointed in the
regular way.

CHARGED WITH
GRAIN FRAUDS
Jacob, Herman and Josua
Eppinger and J. Deming
Indicted by Grand Jury
.
ELECTION CASE HALTED '
Prohibition Writ Prevents
Examination of Rebstock,,
Who Is Awaiting Trial
âÂ±- '
The Grand Jury returned indictments
yesterday against Jacob and Herman
Eppinger, Josua Eppinger and James
Deming. charging them with fraud in
connection with the gigantic warehouse
certificate swindle.
Jacob and Hermann Eppinger, broth
ers, were the principal members of the
firm of Eppinger & Company, and are
already under accusation in court.
Jacob Eppinger having had a trial in
which the jury disagreed. Josua is a
son of Herman Eppinger and took a
prominent part in the business of the
company.
Deming was superintendent of the
firm's warehouses at Crockett. He was
the only member of the quartet to be
arrested last night. Captain Eriekson
and E. H. Aigeltinger furnished bail in
the amount of $12,000 and Deming was
released from custody.
It appears that when Bernard Ett
linger, who was associated with the
Eppingers, returned from Europe re
cently he became provoked at the
stories that he learned had been cir
culated about him during his absence,
emanating chiefly, he believed, from
the Eppingers. He, therefore, resolved
to turn the tables and went, to certain
grand jurors to do so. Trie told them
of many new, incriminating matters
against his former partners, it is said.
On this evidence yesterday's indict
ments were based.
Ettlinger also implicated Josua Ep
pinger and Deming, who, he said, were
involved in the wholesale issuance of
bogus warehouse certificates by which
banks were defrauded out of hundreds
of thousands of dollars.
The Grand Jury took no step against
the Election' Commissioners and Regis
trar George P. Adams for alleged ir
regularities in appointment of precinct
boards for the primaries held last Aug
ust. To make out a satisfactoy case
it is desired to have the testimony of
Joseph Rebstock, who is now awaiting
trial on the indictment found by the
former inquisitorial body. He was an
inspector in the Almshouse precinct.
But the Grand Jury ran against a
snag when it undertook to call RebÂ«
stock as a witness, for a writ of pro
hibition is out in his behalf and to '
question him concerning matters in- '
volved in the case would be contempt
of court. For the time being, there
fore, the Jurors are stalled In their
purpose to set prosecution on foot
against the election officials.
Last evening Messrs. Andrews,
Bowes, Bundschu, Stafford and Fink
ing of the Grand Jury met at the |
Mills building rooms and spent several
hours taking evidence In the Baldwin '
Theater matter, which was investigat
ed by the Lilienfeld Grand Jury. The j
witnesses called" were W. S. Leake, (
Charles Leonhaxdt Jr., W. Z. Tiffany
and Inspector Fitisimmdns of the j
Board of Public Works. The action of \
the board, in ordering work stopped
several times when the ten-cent show
house was being fitted up and Abe '
Ruef's connection with the company j
are under inquiry. It was said at the â 
former hearing that Ruef forced him- j
self Into the corporation by means of '
his Influence with the Public Works
Department, but the allegation was
denied, not only by Ruef himself, but
also by the members of the company.
The committee will resume its hear
ing this afternoon at 2 o'clock.
SAY SMITH FIRED SHOTS
THAT KIDDED McCANN
Coroner's Jury Returns Verdict That
Fails to Exonerate Young
Man.
Dr. William Fletcher McNutt Jr.,
the acting autopsy surgeon at the
Morgue, performed an autopsy on the
body of Joseph McCann last night and
as a result of his report the Coroner's
Jury brought in a verdict of death by
bullet wounds caused by shots fired by
Henry Smith.
The autopsy revealed that one bul
let had penetrated the back and
lodged In a vital part. There was an
incised wound in the side in which
there was found no bullet, and this
gave rise to a rumor that the operat
ing surgeons had made the wound in
trying to locate the bullet at the time
McCann was under the anaesthetic
This rumor was set at rest by the
statements of the operating surgeons,
Prs. Poheim, Simon and Cherry, who
said that they extracted the bullet.
They probed for the other bullet, but
failed to find it.
McCann was shot on January 11 by
Henry Smith after making some re*
marks about the mother of Smith's
family, who is the proprietress of a
shady resort on Taylor street. Wit
nesses testified before the jury that
after leaving the saloon at the corner
of Taylor and Eddy streets, where a
quarrel had been prevented, McCann
rushed at Smith ,and during the scuffle
in the street the shots were fired.
If you are ill seek to remove the
cause.

To be delayed for twelve days in this

perience of Paul Terrell, agent of the
Cnited States Trust and Mortgage
Company of New York, who is at the

latest issue of the Hawaiian loan and
vere recently 3old in the Eastern mar
ket at a premium by Territorial Secre

by Terrell to Honolulu for signature.
Terrell was to have sailed for Hono
lulu on the steamship Alameda, leaving
here December 31, but delays on his
overland trip caused him to miss con
nections and he did not reach here un
til yesterday. If he had caught his
steamer he would have landed in Hono
lulu on January 6, the bonds would
have been signed and last Wednesday
would have witnessed his departure
from Hawaii on the Alameda. Return
ing to San Francisco, he would land
here next Tuesday which is now the
earliest day he can leave for the isl
ands. The China sails thwt day. On his
return trip the earliest date he can
reach San Francisco on his way back
to New York, delayed as he Is, will be
February 2, when the Korea will be
due to arrive."This will mean a loss of
sixteen days In the closing up of th<*
bond deal. In which all Hawalians are
deeply Interested and upon which much
of the future welfare of the island Ter
ritory depends. Terrell advised the
Hawaiian officials of his delay, hoping
that their anxiety over the completion
of the deal, which they have been en
deavoring to hasten, would be mate
rially relieved. Meanwhile he is seeing

It was the superior sprinting ability .

athletic, that enabled her to forestall
â¢Mrs. Esther Michaels, 64 and decrepit,
as the formal complainant. No sooner
had the two ladies ceased actual com
bat than they engaged in a speed con
test, making the Hall of Justice a goal
In more than one sense of t#at term.
Mrs. Kane won in a canter, and when
Mrs, Michaels trotted In, a bad second,
she was confronted by two warrants
â accusing her of battery and disturbing
.the peace.
' The contention began upon the roof
â of the tenement number 7 Adelaide
â¢place, a cul-de-sac shooting from Tay
.lpr street, between Post and Sutter. By
agreement between the several house
wives resident in the structure, all of
Whom did their own family laundering,

utilize the roof for clothes-drying pur
poses one day a week, the system hav
ing been adopted to prevent contention

strictly adhered to, or if deviation from
it had been generally approved, peace

"deed, if Mrs. Michaels alone had been
'taken into consultation by Mrs. Kane
and Mrs. Elizabeth Flaherty when
ihose two ladles decided to exchange
.days for clothes-drying, that encounter
Thursday afternoon might never have
eventuated.
â  "On that fateful day Mrs. Michaels
was surprised to see Mrs. Kane sus
pending various articles of feminine
apparel on the line. Knowing that
. Thursday was Mrs. Flaherty's day,
Mrs. Michaels so informed Mrs. Kane
arid demanded to know why the osten
sible usurpation was attempted. Mrs.
.Kane retorted by requesting Mrs. Mi
chaels to attend to her own business
â¢-and permit her neighbors to attend to
theirs, whereupon Mrs. Michaels de
clared that she would not passively
allow the absent Mrs. Flaherty to be
thus deprived of her drying day by
Mrs. Kane or any one else.
â¢. Suiting action to word, Mrs. Michaels
plucked damp lingerie from the line
.and cast it in the face of Mrs. Kane,
who promptly retaliated by seizing a
prop and swinging it against Mrs. Mi
chaels' nose, the impact bruising that
organ and blackening the eye on either
'side of it. Then began the dash for the

by Judge Cabaniss, who continued it
for thirty days after he had rebuked
Mrs. Kane for calling Mrs. Michaels a
liar in open court. Judge Mogan had
the battery case, and when Mrs. Mi
chaels loudly shouted "You lie!" at
Mrs. Kane he postponed further hear
ing until he has consulted Judge Ca
baniss as to the propriety of commit
ting both ladles for contempt or pro
nouncing the vituperative honors even.
Mrs. Flaherty testified in both courts

H. C. Rees, accused of threatening to
kill R. M. Gignoux at the Hotel Prince
ton, was so defiantly boisterous in
Judge Mogan's court that his bail was
raised from $1000 to $5000.
"Market street." he explained,
pointing dramatically at the com
plainant, "isn't wide enough to hold
both of us. I've told him to get out
of town and avert a tragedy."
Then the excited Mr. Rees suddenly
plunged his right hand into a hip
pocket and many of the spectators in
voluntarily shrank and paled. But
he merely drew forth a white -silken
handkerchief, with which he mopped
his face.
"He talked wrongfully about my
friend's wife," was the defendant's
stated provocation of his threats
against Mr. Gignoux. "He also spoke
slightingly of the woman I love."
The accompanying sneer might be
envied by the most villainous villain
that ever provoked execration from
the eallery of the Central Theater.
The man's sanity is doubted. He will
have another Inning to-day.
Frank Folts, able seaman aboard
the British ship Belford, invaded the
cabin of his captain, William C. Mc-
Kinnon, last Thursday afternoon and
boisterously demanded payment in full
of wages due him. The skipper was en
gaged In writing a letter to hisÂ» wife in
old England, and the sentiment in his
soul was rudely jarred by Seaman
Foits' rude interruption, so he accused
that person of disrespect, insubordina
tion, lese majesty and several other
breaches of shipboard discipline and
then undertook to eject him by means
of physical force. Mr. Folts resisting
the attempted expulsion, First Mate
John Tildsley, who happened to be loit
ering abaft the binnacle" when the
scrimmage "began, went to the captain's
aid, but in the mtxup the captain's dog
mistook the mate for an enemy and
gnawed one of his legs. That's how
Mr. Folts came to be accused of peace
disturbance and the captain and mate
of battery before Judge Conlan.
After the court had heard the story
and dismissed the battery charges the
captain expressed a hope that Seaman
Folts would be severely punished, and
when the Judge asked him why he
hoped so the captain said he yearned
to have the mutilation of his mate's leg
avenged.
"But," said his Honor, "it was your
dog, and not this defendant, that
chewed the mate's leg."
"Conceded," was the skipper's rea
soning; "but if this man Folts hadn't
burst Into my cabin and started the
row the mate's leg would not have
been chewed by my dog."
"That may be good sea-going logic,"
the Judge said, "but as this defendant
is not specifically accused of chewing
the mate's leg, and if there is no testi
mony to show that he chewed the
mate's leg, I cannot punish him for
chewing the mate's leg. The best I
can do is to punish him for disurbing
the peace, his guilt of that offense hav
ing been clearly established. How long
would you like to have him impris
oned F*
"I need him aboard the ship," the
captain responded, "and as you decline
to punish him for the leg-chewing I
have no further suggestion to offer."
"All right," said the Judge. "He is
fined $5 for disturbing the peace, said
peace disturbance not having been di
rectly responsible for your dog's mis
taken identification of the mate's leg
for that of your assailant."

Mrs. Ellen Downs demonstrated her
detestation of Patrolman P. J. Folev
after he had warned her to refrain
from peace disturbance by audibly
commenting on his efficiency when
ever he happened to pass her domicile
on Clara street. Standing 'within the
door she shouted her opinions to the
lady residing opposite, who always
was conveniently stationed within her

TO DAY DECIDES
WHIM'S FATE
Byington Will Make Clos
ing Argument for the
Prosecution This Morning
ATTORNEYS ARE BITTER
Each Side Says Witnesses
on the Other Have Giv
en Perjured Testimony
The fate of Charles Wyman, charged
with fraudulently voting the name of i
S. H. Mann, will probably be settled j
before noon to-day. Argument in the I
trial was opened yesterday afternoon,
Attorney John Hosmer began for the ;
prosecution.
"The defense calls this offense a
political crime," said Hosmer. "Some !
of the greatest offenses in the world
are political crimes. The bullet that
took the life of President McKinley i
was leveled against the Government, j
not the man. Yet that act was a polit- ;
ical crime."
The counsel argued that in voting the
name of S. H. Mann Wyman was gull- |
ty of forgery and theft against the
people. "Shall he be permitted to go
with a smile on his face as having ac
complished a clever act of diplomacy?"
ask?d Hosmer.
With scathing sarcasm the prosecutor
attacked the witnesses who had been
introduced to prove an alibi for Wy
man. "Take these witnesses," he said,
"Are they fit to pass on the suffrages ;
of a free and enlightened people? Take
that man Podd and tne boy, Goetzen.
Have you any doubt that the Carson
boy perjured himself? All the election
officers in that booth, presumed to be
appointed by the Election Commis
sioners, are men who owe their ap
pointments to Joseph Rebstock, who
lived in that precinct and served in the
election booth at the Almshouse."
The allegation that Wyman was seen
on the Almshouse road at the time
Fairfax Wheelan says he saw him vote
the name of S. H. Mann drew a biting
denunciation from Hosmer. He said:
Take the walkers on the road to the Alms
house. One acts as timekeeper and starts the
other. He passes Wyman and meets a. friend
who wants money to go to the Orpheum. The
defense has three walkers on the road and
this pretty picture of the hills near the Alms
house.
Attorney Countryman for the defense
went after the witnesses for the prose
cution with equal bitterness.
"Why does Fairfax Wheelan perjure
his immortal soul in this manner?"
asked Countryman. "Because he wants
t<> attack Mr. Maestrettl through Wy
man. Fairfax Wheelan wants to be
boss of that district, and to this end he
has sacrificed honor, manhood, integ
rity and every principleâsimply to be
a political boss."
Speaking of Frank "Tod" McDonald,
a witness for the defense. Countryman
whitewashed the occupation of gam
bling. "I have met gamblers whose
word was as good as a bond. The voca
tion calls for a certain amount of hon
esty. Because a man is a gambler it
does not mean that he cannot speak
the truth."
In protesting the legality of the pri
mary Countryman threw out the hint
that an appeal would be made if Wy
man should be found guilty. He said to
the jury, "You will take the view given
by Judge Lawlor on that question until
it is settled by another tribunal."
In his peroration the attorney for the
defense pleaded that his client be given
the benefit of the doubt. All this time
Wyman sat nonchalantly chewing gum,
wearing the expression of one who was
being bored. His wife and Frank Maes
tretti sat behind him.
Things were made rather uncomfort
able for Attorney Countryman in the
morning by the testimony of George
B. Woods, a private detective. Country
man, according to Woods, drove to a
booth near the Chutes with Jack Ken
na, who is said to have voted ten times
at the primaries. In the booth. Woods
alleges. Countryman whispered, "Don't
try it," and the pair drove off. Country
man denied this on the stand.
Wyman spent last night in jail. This
morning District Attorney Byington
will close for the prosecution and the
case will go to the jury.

Nothing has since been heard nor
seen of the two peddlers who dined in
Mrs. Helen Beckman's restaurant, 967
Howard street, and then refused to
paj' for what they had eaten. They
were followed to the street by Mrs.
Beckman, and when they clambered
Into their waiting wagon and lightly
bade her good-by she unlimbered a
revolver and fired at them. - They did
not extend any more parting courte

dashed away, and it is police opinion
that they are still retreating. Mrs.
Beckman, who is a mild appearing
little person, was arrested â¢ for dis
charging firearms within the city lim

the hearing of the case until the po
lice are convinced that the peddlers
cannot be found to testify. '

ROSY OUTLOOK
FOR BUSINESS
Opening of the Year Sees
Activity in the Leading
Industries of the Nation
NEW YORK. Jan. 13.âDun's Weekly
Review of Trade will to-morrow say:
Erratic weather produces irregularity
in retail distribution of merchandise at
many points, and Southern business is
quiet because of the depression in cot
ton, but the general outlook is consid
ered very bright. Manufacturers report
that confidence is warranted by the
number of new orders while deliveries
on other contracts are of satisfactory
volume.
The best news comes from the iron
and steel Industry, while footwear fac
tories are busy, woolen mills In excep
tionally good condition and activity is
assured among cotton spinners as soon
as the raw material market becomes
settled. Failures for January thus far
compare very favorably with last
year's returns, railroad earnings In
creased 5.8 per cent over those of 1904,
and foreign commerce at this port for
the last week shows a gain of $6,161,667
in imports and a loss of only $981,933 In
exports.
Failures this week numbered 324 in
the United States against 324 last year,
and 28 in Canada compared with 24 a
year ago.
Bradstreet's to-morrow will say: Ac
tivity in industry, particularly iron and
steel and allied trades, furnishes a con
trast to conditions In distribution, in
which there is some irregularity, with
seasonable quietness predominating In
all but a few sections. The undertone
of the general situation Is, however,
one of strength and the potential de
mand is thought to be very large.
Stocks In all hands are light, and the
feeling Is one of confidence. Midwinter
quiet rules wholesale trade in most
lines, and speculation in securities and
staples is quiet at steady prices.
Generally speaking manufacturing in
dustries have three or four months
business booked ahead. The season
for clearance sales In retail lines is well
under way and large distribution is be
ing stimulated by special prices and by
seasonable weather conditions In most
sections. Railway earnings returns in
dicate a very full business proceeding
throughout the country and failures
are rather less than the annual normal
cleanup involves, though the South
contributes more than at a correspond
ing* period in recent years. Collections
as a whole rank fair to good, though
the South still complains and some ex
tensions are asked for there.
Business failures in the United States
for the week ending January 12 num
ber 295 against 278 last week, 315 in the
like week in 1904 and 234 in 1903. In
Canada failures for the week number
24 as against 18 last week and 39 in
this week a year ago.
Wheat, including flour, exports for
the week ending January 5 are 700,950
bushels against 1,411.947 last week and
2,571,215 this week last year. From July
1 to date the exports are 36,871,214 bush
els agaiast 92,291,324 last year.
HAS HAD "DIZZY" CAREER.
Detectives Look Up the Record of
Duke's Bride.
CHICAGO, Jan. 13.âDetectives of the
Mooney & Boland agency have gath
ered the history of Alice Webb-Duke
during the last fourteen years. This
record, it is said, is to be used by the
sons of Brodie L. Duke in their efforts
to have the marriage of their father to
Alice Webb annulled. According to the
evidence the bride of the man,
family name was made familiar
through the tobacco industry, has had
a "dizzy" career.
"If I was asked to class this woman
I would place her at the head of the
champagne drinkers of Chicago," said
one of the detectives. "I don't believe
i I exaggerate it in the least when I say
I that Alice Webb-Duke has probably
[ consumed as much wine as any woman
In this city, if not more than any other.
I Furthermore, from what I have learned
she has spent and helped other to spend
enough money in wine to have pro
moted all the tobacco plantations with
iin a radius of miles of Nacogdoches,
' Tex., where the plantations which she
j claims to own or hold options on are
ilocated.
"She has been ordered from several
I places where she roomed. At 347 Wa
! bash avenue â  she was known as the
j "queen of the champagne habit."
STACK CUTS O'BRIEN.â Patrick O'Brien,
a sailor, lLvlng at 416 Beale street, was so
seriously cut by Thomas E. Stack last night
that the Central Emergency Hospital surgeons
used forty-one stitches In mending him. It la
said that O'Brien followed and insulted Stack's
wife. O'Brien will recover, but Stack is la
Jail for an assault with a deadly weapon.
TO PASS UPON
DUKE'S SANITY
Commission Appointed by
New York Judge to Look
Into His Mental Condition
NEW YORK, Jan. 13.âBrodie _.
Duke, the millionaire half-brother of
the president of the American Tobacco
Company, whose recent marriage was
followed by his commitment to a san
itarium, was brought into the Supreme
Court in Brooklyn to-day on a writ of
habeas corpus, and after a hearing was
sent to the Long Island home until
Thursday next. On that date a com
mission appointed by Justice Gaynor
is to meet to Inquire into Duke's con
dition and make a report as to wheth
er he isÂ»insane.
The writ of habeas corpus on which
Duke was brought Into court to-day
was obtained by W. C. Bramham of
Durham, N. C, who has acted as pri
vate secretary for Duke. Counsel for
Bramham argued for an immediate ex
amination of Duke in court to deter
mine whether or not he was Insane.
This was objected to by Delancey
Nicoll, who said he represented mem
bers of Duke's family and who insist
ed that Duke's sanity should be deter
mined by a commission appointed by
Justice Gaynor.
Nicoll declared that he desired to
secure witnesses for himself and that
the persons whom he represented
"wanted to rescue this man from the
toils of one of the worst associations
of criminals which existed for the
purpose of robbing this man and per
haps killing him."
Bramham's counsel insisted upon an
immediate examination by the court,
but Justice Gaynor refused and or
dered Duke committed to a sanitarium
until January 19, when he will be ex
amined as to his sanity by a commis
sion which Justice Gaynor has already
appointed upon application by counsel
representing Mrs. Alice Webb-Duke,
wife of Brodie _. Duke.
As the proceedings were about to
adjourn Nicoll requested that Duke be
transferred from Sandford Hall to the
Long Island Home. Nicoll represented
that Dr. Brown of Sandford Hall was
about to depart for the. South and
would not be there to take part In the
proceedings. This request was granted
by Justice Gaynor and the proceedings
were closed.
During the argument the attorney
for Bramham declared that Duke's son,
who had instituted the proceedings
which resulted in Duke's commitment,
was on bad terms with his father, and
had been excluded from his father's
home for several years.
Duke was not questioned, nor did he
offer any statement during the proceed
ings. He sat quietly by the lawyers
and was pale and nervous. His
wife was not In the courtroom. An at
tempt was made to question Duke as
he entered the carriage to go to the
sanitarium, but the physicians prevent
ed it. As the carriage started, however,
Duke leaned out of the window and
shouted, "I am going to fight this thing
to the last."
Eefore Duke was taken to the sani
tarium he was in conversation with
three physicians at the courthouse. At
the conclusion of the talk one of the
physicians said Duke was apparently
sane, but in a weakened physical con
dition.
ROYAL CLAIMANT NOT
SERIOUSLY CONSIDERED
Efforts of Edward Lilikalani to Secure
Crown Lands Cause Amuse
ment in Hawaii.
HONOLULU, Jan. 6.âThe news that
Edward K. Lilikalani had entered a
claim to ownership of the crown lands
of the defunct kingdom of Hawaii and
was seemingly seriously considered in
Washington came as a source of
amusement in Honolulu. Lilikalani,
who is well known here, is one of a
large number who have claims to
royal origin. The lands in question
art- valued at about $8,000,000. That
the claimant will make good his claim
is not seriously considered. At the
fall of the monarchy the so-called
crown lands passed to the republic of
Hawaii. Ex-Queen Lilluokalani is an
other claimant.
Swell Club Violates Law.
HONOLULU, Jan. 6.âThe Pacific
Club, Honolulu's swellest social or
ganization, has been held guilty of an
infraction of the law by selling liquor
without a license and the case will be
carried to the Supreme Court on ap
peal. The club, according to the
court's findings, must now pay a fine
and either stop supplying members
with liquor or take out a $1000 li
cense and observe the usual saloon
hours. Governor Carter is himself a
prominent member of the club.
FRAUDS LAID
TO PROMOTERS
Men at Head of Miami and
Erie Canal Company Face
Charges of Conspiracy
CLEVELAND, Jan. 13âSensational
Charges were made against the pro
moters of the Miami and Erie Canal
Transportation Company In a cross
petition filed in the Common Pleas
Court to-day by Attorney Johnson of
this city. It is averred that the four
teen men who promoted the company
deliberately entered into a conspiracy
to cheat and defraud those who later
purchased the stock and bonds of the
company.
It Is declared that th% promoters is
sued to themselves stock of the com
pany with a face value of $2,990,000 and
bonds for $115,000, arid that they cleared
fully $140,000 in cash from deals and
transfers early in the history of the
company. Johnson further declares
that the fourteen men are solvent and
liable for the full amount of the stock
that they transferred to themselves.
He asks the court that a judgment
for $2,990,000 be rendered against them,
and that the promoters be required to
liquidate the judgment forthwith, so
that the indebtedness of the company
can be paid off. Johnson says he holds
fifty shares of the stock of the com
pany.

w NEWS OF THE COUNTY OF ALAMEDA
GEORGE TOWLE, TRAPPED BT FIRE, SAVES
TWO IIS 81 HEROIC JUMP.
With BaHe in Arms' Father Springs in Nick of Time
HEROIC OAKLAND BLACKSMITH AND TWO OF HIS CHILDREN WHOM HE RESCUED FROM THEIR BURNING HOME. RISK
ING HIS LIFE IN THE ACT AND BEING FORCED TO JUMP FROM A BECOND-BTORY WINDOW WITH HIS BABY IN
HS ARMS.
OAKLAND, Jan. 13.âConfined to his
bed by illness. George Towle, a black
smith residing at 5561 Maecall street,
was aroused this morning by the
crackle and roar of flames to find his
dwelling on fire and himself and two
small children prisoners ftn the second
floor of the house, the stairs already
being impassable.
The father hurriedly made a rope of
bedclothing and lowered one of the
children to his daughter, Miss Bertha
Towle, who had already escaped; but
as he was about to lower the other
child from the window the flames
burst through the walls and floor of
the room and Towle was compelled to
Jump from the window with the little
one in his arms. A moment after he
had escaped from the house the fire
burst from the window through which
he had lust leaped.
The origin of the fire is a mystery,
â¢ but Towle believes ,it was caused by
a defective flue. /
The flre broke out a few moments
after 6 o'clock, and in a short- time the
house and its contents had been total
ly destroyed.
Towle had been ill for several days,
and this morning he was unable to
rise at his usual hour. Mrs. Towle
kindled a flre in the kitchen stove be
fore going out to milk some cows, and
it is believed that sparks from this
source were the cause of the flre.
After finishing their work at the
barn Mrs; Towle and the two boys
started to return to the house, when
they discovered that their home was
on flre. They reached the house Just
as Towle leaped from the window.
The children who were with their
father when th<? fire broke out were
Ernest, aged 5 years, and Carl, a baby
but little more than a year old. Neither
of the children was injured, but the
father's ankle was sprained and one
f~ot was cut. He was treated at the
Receiving Hospital.
The family lost everything it pos
sessed. The house was owned by J.
Horning of Oakland. The flre was first
discovered by Leo Sibly. a carrier of
The Call, who drove at once to the
engine house in Alden and gave the
alarm, but by the time the firemen
reached the scene the house was in
ruins.

tinued saturation ( that would dampen the ar
dor of any but an enthusiast. But In spite of

Shakespeare and his playa.

his way, Mr. Warde guided his hearers through
paths already well known but Illuminated
with the light of his own scholarly Interpreta
tion and made fascinating by his clean cut
and graceful reading. The ladles of the West
Oakland Home are well pleased with the suc
cess of the Warde lecture in the face of ad
verse circumstances, and they say that $200
or more will be added to the building fund.

TRIES TO HIDE
GENTLE BIRTH
Young Belgian Sinks His
Identity When Arrested for
Thefts From Eequa Home
PLAYS HOUSE SERVANT
.Mysterious Prisoner Steals
Valuable Bric-a-Brac Be
longing to General Long
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, Jan. 18.
With his identity buried under a
name he admits Is assumed, a young
Belgian of good family was arrested
this afternoon on a charge of stealing
valuable bric-a-brac and household be
longings from Brigadier General Oscar
F. Long at Highlands, the Piedmont
home of the Isaac L. Requas. The pris
oner gave the name of Eugene Legros,
said he was 20 years old and a sales
man. This description, he confessed,
was untrue, and has been taken in an
effort to conceal his real self and his
fate from kinsmen across the sea.
l<egroa had been employed at the
Requa residence as a household ser
vant. But there is every indication
that that was not his real station in
life. While there at work he had ac
cess to the home and to the storerooms,
where a large quantity of valuable
china, brassware and other belongings
of General lAng were temporarily
boxed. From* these articles, it is
charged, Legros helped himself and
sold the stolen wares among second
hand shops in tnis city and San Fran
cisco. None of the property was miss
ed until a few days ago, when the po
lice notified General Long. It was
through Detective Shorey that the pur
loining was discovered.
That officer a few weeks ago found
that second-hand stores were receiving
rare china ware, brasses and high
grade garments in a quantity and of a
character that aroused Shorey's sus
picions. He traced the man who had
been selling the unusual merchandise,
?nd was given an explanation by
Legros that temporarily satisfied the
detective. But Shorey persisted until
he finally located the source of the
young Belgian's supply. As soon as
General Long had investigated he
missed many of the family's pos
sessions. Legros was followed to San
Francisco to-day and there placed un
der arrest while he was disposing of
some chinaware.
General Long swore to a warrant
charging Legros with larceny.
Under pressure of questioning by the
police Legros gave enough information
to enable General Long to recover most
of the stolen goods.
Legros is tall, athletic of build and
refined in appearance and manner. Dis
claiming ability to speak English well,
the mysterious young foreigner con
versed fluently In French, and by ac
cent and manner gave every indication
of knowledge of the upper side of life.
Of his antecedents he politely but firm
ly refused to talk, other than to say
he had come to America five months
ago from Brussels. He said the Bel
gian capital was his home, but a touch
upon his family connections brought
only a quiet evasion as tears filled His
eyes.
Legros, representing himself as a
house servant, went to work at the
Requas six weeks ago. His conduct
was excellent, and not the slightest
suspicion attached to him. The police
will make efforts to trace Legros back
to Belgium.
BOARD WANTS FIVE
MORE POLICEMEN NOW
Chief Hodgklns Shows There Are
Less Than Fifty Men on Patrol.
Henderson Vindicated.
OAKLAND, Jan. 13.âThe Board of
Police and Fire Commissioners decided
this afternoon to ask the City Coun
cil to allow the appointment at once of
five additional policemen. This action
Is based on a report filed by Chief of
Police Hodgklns that there are only
forty-eight policemen on patrol duty
in the city.
The resignation of Special Police
man A. T. Jacobson, charged with de
faming the character of Patrolman H.
B. Henderson, waa accepted. Hender
son asked the board to hear the
charge against Jacobson in order that
there might be no question as to the
vindication of Henderson from the
charges of theft that Jacobson had
made against him. The Commission
ers said Henderson had been exoner
ated by the board's action in dismiss
ing Jacobson's charges and that the
record was absolutely clean so far as
Henderson was concerned.

CITES BATTLE
FOR HER LIFE
Stepdaughter of George Row
land Tells Story of Fight
With Slayer of Her Mother
PISTOL FAILS TO FIRE
Mrs. Maud Sonderleiter Says
She Tried to Get Weapon
From the Crazed Assassin
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
1016 Broadway, Jan. 13.
A dramatic story of the battle for
life with her murderous stepfather,
George H. Rowland, was told by Mrs.
Maud Sonderleiter this afternoon at
the coroner's Inquest over the bodies
of Rowland and his wife, whom he
shot yesterday before cutting his own
throat in the kitchen of their home at
918 Center street. The encounter, Mrs.
Sonderleiter declared, occurred after
she ran to the kitchen, having heard
the two shots Rowland bad fired at her
mother. The young woman had opened
the kitchen door and rushed upon Row
land, who was standing, she said, over
the prostrate form of his wife. She
continued:
He had a pietol tn hi* hand and I jumped
for him and grappled as he shouted he would
kill all of us. 1 struggled with him and
seized him around the neck, trying to. choke
the man. But I could not get a good hold
because my gloves covered my hands.
While we struggled back and forth he
pressed the pistol to my head and snapped It
three times, but the cartridges did not ex
plode. As I got away he tried twice again
to shoot me. but again the weapon failed to
go off. When I was free and after he had
failed to shoot me, he tried twice to kill him
self, aiming the pistol at his head. The last
I saw of my stepfather was when he rushed
to the pantry and got a small black box
from a shelf.
Mrs. Sonderleiter said the stepfather
often drank heavily and when In his
cups was violent.
Mrs. Ethel Day, another one of Mrs.
Rowland's daughters, did not witness
the encounter of her sister with Row
land. She testified her sister had pre
ceded her to the kitchen, where they
heard the shooting. Mrs. Day, Mrs.
Sonderleiter and George Rowland, their
stepbrother, were in the parlor when
Mr. and Mrs. Rowland returned from
their trip to the lawyer's office to set
tle their property affairs.. Rowland,
according to Mrs. Day, seemed to have
been drinking. She added:
I rushed to the kitchen when I heard the
shots and nay stster ran In. 1 saw Mr. Row
land trying to shoot himself. After 1 looked
at my mother lying on the floor I ran out
toward the front door. I had feared he might
do something to Injure mother and I spoke
to her that morning because he had been
acting so peculiarly when unaer the influence
of liquor. He drank to excess very often.
Edward Rowland's version was dif
ferent from that of his stepsisters. He
declared that, when he stepped into the
kitchen his father rushed toward him,
pistol in hand. The young man said he
picked up a chair and knocked his
father down, trying to get the pistol,
but the parent recovered the weapon
and flred a shot at his son, who ran
into the hall, where he saw his step
sisters and rushed them out of the front
door. The young man said he went
back to the door and heard his father
shout, 'Til kill you all."
The coroner's Jury found that Row
land had killed his wife while he was
under the Influence of liquor. Mrs.
Rowland was 48 years old and a native
of Placer County. Her body will be tak
en to Byron, where the funeral will be
held. A daughter resides there. Row
land's funeral will be held Sunday.
Hubert George Rowland, a son of
the murderer. has % deeded property at
the southwest corner of Campbell and
William streets to Manuel Baptists, a
grocer at Third and Peralta streets.
The deed was dated yesterday, but
was filed for record this afternoon.
The consideration was placed at $10.
a nominal figure.

SWITCH ENGINE IS DERAILED
ON ALICE-STREET BRIDGE
Spreading of Ralls Causes Mishap,
Which Delays Traffic for
Several Hours.
OAKLAND, Jan. 13.âThe derailing
of a switch engine on the Alameda
side of the Alice-street bridge about 2
o'clock to-day caused a blockade

and traffic was resumed. The block
ade prevented the running of the
Webster-street local trains to Oak
land and the broad gauge to Alameda.

CHARGES FRAUD
IN LAND DEAL
Money Lender Says That He
Was Deceived by San Fran
cisco Real Estate Agent
"RINGER" IN THE CASE
Henry C. Wulff to Make Com
plaint to the Grand Jury
Against T. F. Chatneld
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, Jan. 13.
Charging that he is the victim of the
duplicity of Thomas F. Chatneld of
the real estate firm of Chatfield & Vin
sent of 228 Montgomery street, San
FranclÃCO, Henry C. Wulff appeared
before Judge Hall this morning for
redress. He declares that Chatneld
gave him a second mortgage for JIOQO,
representing that it was a first mort
gage, and to cover up his deception
paid him interest on the money for
three years, the property having been
sold in the meantime under an execu
tion of the court to satisfy the first
mortgage.
Growing out of this transaction is
another which Henry A. Davis, attor
ney for Wulff, says they intend to
have investigated by the Grand Jury
and in this connection he makes the
following statement:
When the first mortgagee began proceedings
to foreclose In 1901 a summons was issued to
my client as an Interested party, he holding
a second mortgage. Attorney Howard K.
James of Alameda received the summons to
serve. He went to Chatfleld's of flee by ap
pointment and was there Introduced to a man
as being Henry C. Wulff and served him with
the summons. Chatneld also engaged James
to look out for Wulff s Interest in the proceed
ing. James signed the agreement necessary
In the case and received his fee.
All this time my client, the real Mr. Wulff.
was ignorant of any of the proceedings. Some
other man was introduced to James and repre
sented by him. We had no suspicion of any
thing wrong until a few months ago. when
the mortgage was about to become due. We
began to take steps to foreclose and then dis
covered the property had been sold and the
rights of both the first and second mortgaee
adjudicated and settled nearly three years ago.
I hunted up James and Introduced him to the
real Mr. Wulff, whom he said he had never
seen befons.
Attorney Howard K. James accom
panied Davis and his client this morn
ing and had an affidavit prepared to
read to the court, setting forth his
part in the transactions and corrobo
rating the statements made by Attor
ney Davis. Davis made a motion be
fore Judge Hall to have the Judgment
of the court set aside and all the per
sons interested in the settlement of the
mortgages cited to appear in court.
Judge Hall held that such a motion
was not the proper proceeding and said
their redress was in a suit in equity.
He told James that his affidavit would
also be proper at that time.
Henry Wulff said that he was em
ployed as head chemist at the Selby
Works in San Francisco and had a
little money to loan. For a number of
years he had trusted Chatneld to do
his business for him. He paid little
attention to the papers given to him
When Chatneld came to him one day
and said he had a first-class mortgage
on some Oakland property out on
Twentieth street, he said he had given
him the money, taken the mortgage
and thought no more about it.

ANNUAL SALE, TEN MILLION BOIESDORIC ARRIVES FROM ORIENT
MAKES PORT WITH GREAT DIFFICULTY
â¢ The Occidental and Oriental Steam
ship Company's liner Doric, Captain
Harry Smith, arrived yesterday after
noon from the Orient, ending her long
voyage in safety but making port with
great difficulty and without a pilot
through the smother of a howling
southeaster. Under ordinary circum
stances the Doric would have been in
port at sunrise and daylight found
quarantine and customs officials all
waiting for the liner.
"Doric, six miles. - ' was reported by
the Merchants' Kxohange about 11:30 a.
m. "('an see sixteen miles, no Doric in
sight." was the report at 2 o'clock. A
squall had shut the liner from view and
when the weather cleared she was out
. f g ght. Back she came, however, and
shortly after 3 o'clock came the report:
"Doric, three miles." This time she
reached quarantine, was passed In rec
ord time and by 5 o'clock was tied up
at her berth at the Pacific Mall wharf.
That the Doric gouin at all yesterday
Is a tribute to the skill of Captain
Smith. For three days the sun's face
had been hidden and not a sight did
the Doric's navigators get during that
time. All of Thursday night the wind
howled with vicious fury. Navigating
by dead reckoning for a port like San
Francisco with the jagged rocks of the
Farallones as a trap in the mariner's
path is ticklish work. Not daring to
take his bearings from the islands Cap
tain Smith headed for where he figured
Point Reyes should be and that head
land was the first land sighted. His
r-ourse had been maintained as truly as
if sun and stars had been the guides.
The storm had driven the pilot boats
into the harbor, but the Doric has been
here so often that she knows the way
in. Pilot "Jimmy" Miller boarded the
liner off Meiggs wharf and made up
for his late arrival by taking the Doric
alongside the wharf in splendid style
and gliding her into her berth as if
she had been a tiny launch.
Although high out of the water the
Doric brought a valuable cargo, which
included 1635 bales of hemp, 819 rolls
<>f matting, 1477 bales of raw silk, val
ued at more than $1,000,000, and 3504
chests of tea.
The iiner brought ninety-one passen
gers, of whom fifty-one were Asiatics.
At Honolulu she landed 241 Koreans
and 231 Japanese.
Among the passengers was Lieuten
ant Commander J. C. Gillmore of the
United States Navy. Gillmore is the
officer, who, when attached to the
Yorktown, was captured by Filipinos
and held prisoner until rescued by Ma
jor Hoare. Gillmore and Surgeon L.
L. yon TVedekind, also a passenger on
thâ¬ Doric, have been attached to the
â¢ in-innati. Assistant Paymaster T. H.
Sanderson of the navy, who has .been
ined at Guam, also returned on the
liner.
T. Hodsumi and his wife arrived on
i Doric. Hodsumi is a banker and
ion r ? here to take the management of
the Yokohama Specie Bank. He was
Bl oned for some years at New York
but h,s last charge was the company's
bram h at Monckong. Among the pas
se liters wore foreign army officers, mis
trlea, business men and globe trot
teis

Finishes New Engine.
F*-ank Peters, who for some years has been
I.'enr> Peterson's chief engineer and who has
; â¢ his spare time building gasoline en
gines. In an improvised machine shop at the
i-ar of lbs boathouse, has just installed the
latest result of his Ingenuity in the big Pcter
t n launch William D. The engine which
nvm one replaces weighed 5800 pounds.
The new engine weighs MOO piunds. Th*
flywheel on the old engine weighed 1200
- th" r ew flywheel only 200 pounds. The
iglne developed twenty-seven horsepower.
T':Â«. new engine, which had a trial during the
Wight of yesterday's storm, develops fifty
h' rÂ«epc,wer and runs like a watch. The new
engine is a four cylinder, four cycle affair.
â = without a battery and Is equipped
with noiseless reversing gear, on which Peters
expects to secure a patent.
Storm Sweeps the Harbor.
A stiff southeaster swept the waters of the
harbor yesterday, making life on the bay
<J sagTeeabie but causing no damage. There
are fÂ»â. vessels in the anchorages exposed to
tr- s"uth wind or there might have been s.
tiifferent tale Storms of less violence have
made plenty of trouble In this harbor. The
bar was breaking to such an extent that al!
thÂ» pilot-boats came In and few vessels passed
in or out through the Golden Gate. As the
wind in th<- harbor dl"d down the blast on
the coast Increased In violence. The wind
Was blowing sixty miles an hour from the
south off Point Reyes Rt 6 p. m. and fifty
miles an hour off the Karallones. At Point
lx>boÂ«. however. Just a light southeast breeze
fanred the Instruments on the weather bureau.
Fifteen Hour* on River Bar.
The little steamer Argo, which left Eel
River yesterday for this port, had a narrow
escape on Thursday from destruction on the
river bar. A big sea was running and in
crossing the bar the Arg.. struck, damaging
her steering gear. For fifteen hours she was
tossed and tumbled an.ong breakers while
those on board wrought to repair the disabled
steering gear. Repairs made and the vessel
again under control she managed to get out
of the troubled waters and ba> k to Ferndale
under her own steam and without sustaining
any damage to her hull. She resumed her
voyage at 2 o'clock >esterday afternoon.
Annie M. Campbell Not Wrecked.
Xhe hydrographlo office calls the attention
of mariners to an error in the February edi
tion of the Pacific Pilot Chart, which shows
a derelict to the northward of the Columbia
River and gives the name as Annie M. Camp
bell. It was the Annie M. Campbell's captain
that ireported the derelict, the identity or
' which has not been established.
Rate on Robert Rickmers Advanced.
The rate of reinsurance on the Robert Rb k
ruers was advanced yesterday to 40 per cent.

STRIKES A ROCK
AND GOES DOWN
Steamship Columbia Meets
With Disaster on Fishing
Trip Off Vancouver Island
CREW TAKE TO DORIES
Officers and Sailors Reach
Shore and Are Later Picked
Up by a Passing Vessel
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VANCOUVER. B. C, Jan. 13â The |
steamship Columbia, engaged in hali- i
but fishing on the northern coast,
struck a rock and sank in half an hour
last Monday night off the northern end
of Vancouver Island. News of the
wreck was brought to Vancouver to
night by the steamship New England,
which also brought the crew of the ves
sel.
Thirty-six men were aboard the Co
lumbia when she struck/an uncharted
rock. She was going a* full speed at
the time, though the night was dark
and foggy. She tore a big hole in her
bow and began to fill so rapidly that
her crew at once took to the dories and
from a safe distance watched the
steamship fill and go down. She sank
in half an hour in deep water. The men
had water and provisions and were able
to reach shore before morning. There
they remained until yesterday morn
ing, when they were picked up by the
New England, which was passing down
the coast.
The Columbia was 128' feet long and
was valued at $50,000.

Bridgford and Burrell G. White of
their administration of the estate of
Thomas J. Clunie, in which, it was
charged that the two executors had
misapplied the funds of the estate,
the services of a public accountant
were secured to go over the accounts.
His affidavit and report were filed yes
terday and will become an exhibit
defense of the executors in the hear
ing now pending.
Alfred G. Piatt, the accountant, re
ports that he examined the inventory
and the accounts of Bridgford and
White on January 5; the date upon
which Clunie's objections were filed,
and finds, first, that the accounts show
the receipt of various property, real
and personal, together with the in
come thereof, and also the disburse
ments made in the administration of *
the estate; second, that there are
vouchers or duly Indorsed checks for
each and evejy item of disbursement, j
all such Items relating to the property i
of the estate; third, the various books ,

REGULATE GRAIN STORAGE
AT THE SEAWALL SHEDS
Secretary Foy of Harbor Commission
ers Presents Report Making Rec
ommendations fw Wharfage.
At the regular meeting of the State
Board of Harbor Commissioners yes
terday afternoon the American-Ha
waiian Steamship Company petitioned
the board to have Pier No. 25 widened
thirty feet to accommodate their busi
ness that has increased largely during
the last twelve months. The company
is operating the steamships Nebras
ka n and Nevadan and is going to en
gage still more actively with these
vessels in trade between this port and
Puget Sound. The petition was or
dered filed and will be taken under
consideration later by the board.
Secretary Foy, who had been in
structed to draw up certain recom
mendations regarding flour, grain and
millstuffs stored in the grain sheds of
the seawall, submitted his report. Mr.
Foy recommends that a charge of 5
cents per ton be imposed on ship
ments, but asks that three days of free
storage be allowed from the date
when the vessel finishes discharging.
For an additional 5 cents wharfage it
is proposed to allow fifteen days' stor
age in the back part of the sheds. The
proposals bring the handling of grain
shipments at the seawall down to a
system and the board will probably
adopt the recommendations at a near
date.
SCHLESINGER CONTENDS
MOLD IS NOT COMPLETE
Preliminary Hearing of Charge Against |
John and Kate Russell Develops
a Novel Law Point.
Bert Schlesinger, counsel for John
Russell and Kate Russell, charged ,
with being in possession of a flve-dol- I
lar mold, raised the point before I
United States Commissioner Heacock !
yesterday that as the plaster of paris j
did not bear the impression of the re
verse side of the coin it was not a ,
counterfeiting mold. He argued fur- I
ther that the product of .the mold !
would be a coin, blank on one side j
and not perfect on the other, and that
such a coin would not deceive any per- j
son exercising ordinary caution. He j
asked that the charge against Mrs.
Russell should be dismissed, as there
was no evidence to show that she
knew anything at all about the mold.
Mrs. Russell was then placed on the
stand and swore that about a year ago
she requested her husband to make
her a pair of sleeve buttons, gilded in
imitation of five-dollar gold pieces.
She admitted that she had seen him
working with plaster of paris and
metal, but denied that she knew that
it was a mold. The hearing went over
until next Thursday.
HEINZE'S COMPANY SCED
BY BUTTE AND BOSTON
Further Litigation Between Mining
Concerns in the State of
Montana.
BUTTE, Mont, Jan. 13. âTwo com
plaints against the Montana Ore Pur
chasing Company and associated in
terests have been filed in the Federal
Court here by the Butte and Boston
Mining Company for claims aggregat
ing $1,740,000. The complainants
claim a four-fifths interest in ore ex
tracted from the Michael Davitt mine
by the Ore Purchasing Company.
These suits are in addition to a
number of others filed from time to
time which aggregate millions of dol
lars and is a continuation of the fight
between Heinze and the Butte and
Boston Company for valuable copper
mining property in the vicinity of this
city.

PUBLJCATION" OFFICE THIRD AND MARKET STREETS. SAN FRANCISCO
SATURDAY A .JANUARY 14. 1905
PENNYPACKER AND THE PRESS.
GOVERNOR PENNYPACKER is again to the fore in his
quarrel with the newspapers of Pennsylvania. He procured
the passage of a law respecting the use of cartoons and cari
catures in newspapers. This law seems to have failed of its object,
for the papers have smitten him in many a tender spot since it
was enacted, and now he wants another law regulating newspaper
criticism of public officials.
One need not be suspected of indorsing the misuse of publicity
by newspapers because of deprecation of such legislation. Xo
doubt injustice is often done to individuals by the press. But
it is difficult to draw the line so as not to cause greater injustice
to the whole community by curbing the freedom of the press. Such
an anti-cartoon law as was passed in Pennsylvania would have
restrained the pencil of Xast in assaulting Tweed and his ring in
New York City. But Xast had a free hand and used it with such
effect that it is the acknowledged cause of the discovery that Tweed
and his gang had stolen $26,000,000 from the taxpayers.
Xast was the force that brought them to an accounting, to
arrest, to flight from prison, and his cartoons were the means of
recognizing Tweed in exile and of his return to trial, conviction
and the cumulative sentence which resulted in his ending his days
in jail. It is true that Xast put his pencil to a purpose not praise
worthy in his pursuit of Horace Greeley in the campaign of 1872,
but Mr. Greeley, in his editorial career, had been no respecter of
persons, and if he suffered, as he no doubt did, from the attacks of
the artist, it was expiatory to a certain degree.
The free treatment of the reputations and acts of public men
has characterized the American press from the beginning of our
Government. We are accustomed now to look back to the early
days of the republic as a golden age. Time has so refined the
public judgment as to the characters of Washington, Jefferson,
Hamilton and the worthies of that day that we are apt to conclude
that in that time Americans were a-band of brothers, bound together
by the ties of a patriotic sacrifice, and in honor preferring one
another. But this view is so far from the truth that it may be
said that the present time is a period of justice, thoughtfulness
and kindly speech about public men compared to that.
The newspapers denounced Washington as a Tory, belittled his
military achievements, abused him savagely for violating the French
treaty, and in like manner attacked the author of the Declaration
of Independence as an infidel, a "Red" after the sort of the French
terrorists, a traitor and a thief. Washington was a very self-con
tained man. with a violent temper which he held in firm control,
and there exists no record that proves that he winced under this
fire of detraction. But Jefferson did wince and his later expressions
are full of resentment of the attacks made upon him. Yet he never,
proposed any reprisals, but to the last stood fÂ©r the most complete
freedom of the press, declaring that error could do no harm if truth
were left to oppose it. That was the view of a philosopher.
No one denies that freedom of the press often degenerates
into license, and that licentiousness works vast harm to individuals.
But any restraint upon license, for the benefit of the wrongly accused,
sure to become a restraint upon liberty, for the benefit of those
who arc getting only what the}' deserve. Xo upright public char
acter in this country has suffered injury from untruthful attacks.
The people are wise and of good judgment, and in any serious matter
they discriminate nicely in judging the newspaper treatment of pub
lic men and public measures. Merely wflful abuse or sensational
criticism will get readers, but will not carry conviction. All wise
pewspaper men and thoughtful journalists recognize the harm done
to the press itself by yellow journalism, but. if they were consulted,
would vote to leave the infliction of the punishment to that public
judgment which in the finality is sure to be right.
it would have been better if Governor Penny packer had kept
his patience and philosophy. His quarrel with the Philadelphia
North American is a personal affair. The people will recognize its
virulent features, and wherein and to the extent of the injustice it
has done the newspaper and not the Governor will suffer. The
public mind in this country is revolting more and more against
the licentious abuse of public men. This revolt began when Presi
dent McKinley was assassinated in the midst of a campaign of vile
personal abuse by the yellow press. Living, his reputation sustained
no injury, and dead, his memory suffered no dishonor by those
attacks. The Governor of Pennsylvania would have done wiser had
his message temperately and judicially discussed the subject in a
perfectly impersonal way. The number of people who support yel
low journalism grows less every year. That kind of journalism is a
loathsome moral disease and will finally come to be recognized and
shunned like any other nasty and revolting thing. â 
THE SUNDAY CALL MAGAZINE.
AGAIN a San Francisco writer wins the $50 cash prize for
the best fiction story submitted to the Sunday Call Magazine,
the winning story being entitled "The Invention that Changed
the Will." written by W. E. Whitmore. Mr. Whitmore's story i
in a slightly different vein from many previous prize winners in
that it is almost purely humorous and works ingenuously up to
an amusing climax. "The Brethren," H. Rider Haggard's latest
novel, runs through its third installment. Following "The Brethren"'
will appear Hallie Erminie Rives' latest novel, "The Castaway," the
story of Lord Byron, one of the latest and most popular of the fall
books.
In fiction stories and in special articles of pertinent interest the
issue is more than usually enlivened. There is a full-page story
by Ellsworth Kelly. "The Man Who Found Himself." a splendid,
wholesome story of a man. a boy and a childhood friend. In addi
tion there are two storiettes by well-known writers of clever little
love stories for ten minutes' reading: Belle Maniates. "His Little
Mascot," and Martha McCulloch Williams. "Love of Loris." Opie
Read continues his pithy discourses upon everyday topics, with " The
Country Doctor," who is thus eulogized: "Every unan that gets
money without stealing it. earns it I reckon : but I don't know of
anybody that comes nearer to earning it twice over than the coun
try doctor. He has to put forth all the skill he has and then has
to lie to keep hope alive. And hope is the best medicine ever dis
covered, for it not only aids the sick, but helps the well <o bear
their burdens."
The adventures of Charles Dryden's. wandering hero in "On
and Off the Bread Wagon" are continued with a panegyric upon the
outlook in Texas for a man ambitious but "broke." The new scries
of Chimmie Fadden stories, from the pen of Edward W. Tovvnsend,
are continued, with the irrepressible Chimmie conspicuously among
those present at a house party. Kate.Thyson Marr. whose caustic
articles in arraignment of those who neglect their families are
well known, contributes "Molehills and Mountains."
For women, there is a page by Edna Wallace Hopper, the well
known actress, on "Physical Culture for Women," and a page by
Madge Moore, "The Woman with a Fad." The puzzle page appears
as usual for the children.

THE SAX FRAXCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, JANUARY 14. 1905
GORDON WAVERLlTS WAY
GORDON WAVERLET was in
love and had Just discovered
it. He had been proof against
the wiles of feminine art; and
having reached the age of 32 he con
sidered himself immune.
Then vengeance overtook him. He
did not recognize vengeance, how
ever, in the charming guise of Made
leine Vernon. He only knew that she
was, as he expressed it, just the girl
for whom he had been looking. This
would have been very amusing to his
associates had they known it, for
since his grammar school days he had
been noted for sedulously looking away
from everything feminine.
Gordon had suffered from a blight
ed heart at the age of 14 and had
never fully recovered. The author of
his Injury, Miss Laura Boice, fifteen
years his senior, had been led to the
altar by his elder brother, and envy,
hatred and malice had ranked in his
boyish heart for several years.
At the age of 16 he was a professed
woman-hater. At 24 he tolerated the
poor, weak creatures as necessary evils
which might have been dispensed with
had a little more foresight been exer
cised when the earth and its inhabi
tants were being planned. At 30 he
found them very convenient as man
agers and servants in the beautiful
mansion where he dwelt alone after
his parents had gone to their long
rest; but he often wondered how other
men found them attractive and com
panionable.
Now he was holding a long and not
altogether pleasant interview with
himself before the glowing grate fire
ir. his luxurious library.
His thoughts reverted to the pleas
ures of the glorious October just
passed. The long drives over the
pleasant country roads âhow delighted
Madeleine had been with the gorgeous
coloring of the maples! The exhilar
ating rides in the crisp, morning airâ
how well Madeleine rode and how su
perbly beautiful she looked in the sad
die! The jolly afternoons on the golf
links âMafleleine was a fine player,
and how full of unconscious grace!
The delightful evenings at the Gra
hams âhe considered Jack Graham
cue of his best friendsâand Mrs. Gra
ham really was quite entertaining!
He laughed a little in confusion as he
remembered that this very high opin*
ion of the Grahams had been reached
only since the advent of Miss Made
leine Vernon, a cousin of Mrs. Gra
ham.
I suppose.'* he soliloquized, his
honest face reddeeiing in the dancing
fire light, "I suppose this is what they
call love. There is no reason why I
shouldn't be in love." half defiantly,
' and. of course, the next thing is to

Mrs. ShopperâWhat! All that for

Great Waste of Timber.
The annual consumption of ties on
the 203,132 miles of railroad track in
this country is 114.000,000. Every
year finds It harder for the railroads
to get their supply. Granite, metal
and concrete ties have been experi
mented with, but nowhere permanent
ly adopted. In Europe the railroads
have for a long time been treating
their ties by various chemical pro
cesses, which have more than trebled
their lives. The Bureau of Forestry at
Washington has been conducting ex

marry. I wonder how long it takes
for a girl to fall in love."
Then an expression of anxious
doubt came into his face.
"Perhapsâperhaps she's already in
love. She may be engaged. No," he
continued emphatically, "she isn't en-
"I've just been told. Miss Ver
non, that we are reported to
be engaged."
S.-rged. I'm sure of that. Now, Gor
don, get a hustle on yourself and see
to it that she is engaged at once, and
to yourself. I wonder how such a
thing is done."
He looked diligently over the book
shelves. "Surely, there ought to be
some treatise on such an important
theme." he murmured, disappointedly.
Then, as a more feasible idea oc
curred to him, he turned to another
part of the room and anxiously
searched through several of the popu
lar novels of the day.
"Bah," he muttered disgustedly, "any
self-rosp- cting girl would despise a
man who talked like that."
"Jack, old fellow," as Graham's
square shoulders pushed in from be
hind the silken draperies, "you are just
the man T want to see. How did you
propose to your wife?"
Graham stared, bewildered by the
blunt and unexpected question.
"I'm in earnest. Jack. I want to know
how the thing is done."
Jack grinned and actually blushed.

English Lawyers' Robes.
The English bar still clings devot
edly to its robes. A solicitor who for
some reason was not prepared with
his professional costume asked per
mission of a London Judge the other
day to appear without it, but the
Judge declared that he could give no
such sanction. However, to avoid de
lay, he resorted to a fine legal dis
tinction: *T do not give you permis
sion, but if the other professional gen
tlemen present raise no objection I
will consent to hear you." He was
heard, and it may be trusted that no
sacred precedent was damaged.
"Shall I give it to you 'fancy' or
straight?"
"No frills, Jack, please, straight
goods. I'll keep it." '
"Well, on your honor to keep it. I
learned a lot of poetry twaddle and
started to reel It off to her, and she
looked me straight in the eyes and
said, 'Goodness. Jack Graham, are you
trying: to propose to me?' And I said,
quite humbly, That's what, Edith.' She
laughed and said, 'Jack, dear, I
wouldn't miss you for the world.'
That's all there was to it. If you're
really in earnest just make a start, and
the girl'll do the rest. That is, if she's
in earnest, too. If she isn't she'll make
you amble through the whole thing,
and then say sweetly. 'So sorry,* 'I
never dreamed,' and 'We'll always be
friends.' "
Waverley smiled appreciatively. Jack
had been proposing since he was six
teen and he should know.
"I was going to ask you," Jack con
tinued, "but of course I needn't now â
if congratulations are in order. I heard
this morning that you and* Miss Vernon
are engaged."
"Congratulations will have to be
postponed until I go and ask her," ad
mitted Waverley. "You sit here and
read while 1 run over and see if the
report of our engagement has any
foundation in fact."
Jack obediently took the easy chair
before the tire place.
"Waverley's an odd stick," he said
to the fire, "but if Madeleine doesn't
h< lp him out she's a goose."
Waverley lost no time in prelimi
naries.
' I've just been told, Miss Vernon,
that we are reported to be engaged."
"How strange! Who would have
taken such a.liberty?"
"Weil, Miss Vernon, 1 think it would
be far easier, and certainly, for me,
much happier, to make the rumor true,
than to go to the trouble of denying it
and trying to have the denial accepted.
Can't you agree with me, Madeleine,
dear?"
"I âI think you are right." she ad
mitted, "denials of such a thing are al
ways ineffective, and in some cases
positively distressing. It âit would be
to me in this case," she added de
murely.
He took one quick step toward her,
then turned and crossed the room to
the telephone. When communication
had bÂ°en established with his own
home, he called jubilantly, "It's all
right. Jack, congratulations are in or
der, butâyou needn't be in any hurry
abo # ut extending them in person."
Then he sat down beside Miss Ver
non, and said and did things just as
happily foolish as those of which he
had read in the novels in his own li
brary.

Superintendent Langdon submitted

yards be opened for playgrounds and

and lecture halls. The report, which
met with the appropriation of the
board, says:
The SupÂ«-rijitendent s office has been consid
ering for some months the larger us- of our
school properties for public education. We
liave 17,000,000 invented in arhoolhouses and
grounds. Moat of this property is In use five
hours a day for tea months in the year. A
fear achoolhtaiaea render an additional service
for night school. Xo business establishment
would allow bo valuable a property to lie idle
over half the time, when it might be used in
. furtherance of its ends. Schools are designed
for the mental, moral and physical education
of children and. as far as possible, should
stimulate and encourage self education in
adults. Recognixing this, many of our largfc
itles are opening their s-hoolyards for play
grounds and the school buildings for reading
rooms and lecture halls. Our night schools
are doing yoeman service in offering instruc
tion to those vo whom circumstanet-s deny the
benefit of the day schools. Hut this doea not
â¢ fully meet the need.
The Superintendent's office has made a study
of children's games and plays and is prepared
.to make th's a department of school work.
We are aware that funds are not now avail
able to get the greatest educational use from
our school houses and grounds, but we recom
â  mend that a beginning be made and that there
be provision in next year's budget to extend
. the work. The playground Is perhaps the
moat urgent need at present. The grounds
at the Hancock. Lafayette and Rlncon schools
should be open to the children from :;:.'!o'to
?>:3O end from l> to 12 and 2 to 5 each Satur
â¢ day. These grounds should be arranged for
handball, bean board. quoits and similar
games offering good physical development, ex

Each of th<Â»se grounds should h" provided with
'â¢ a caretaker to protect school property and
. direct the play. The time in the playgrbund
should be equally divided between the girls
and tV boys, each coming on alternate days.

ments described would be carried out

HABIT'S CHAIN.
Certain Habits Unconsciously Formed
and Hard to Break.
An ingenious philosopher estimates
that the amount of will power neces- i
sary to break a life-long habit would, ;
= if- it could be transformed, lift a weight
. of many tons.
It sometimes requires a higher degree I
of heroism to break the chains of a per
nicious habit than to lead a forlorn
hope in a bloody battle. A lady writes
â¢ from an Indiana town:
â¢ "From my earliest childhood I was a
â¢lover of coffee. Before I was out of my
teens I waa a miserable dyspeptic, suf
fering terribly at times with my stom
ach.
"I was convinced that it was coffee
that was causing the trouble, and yet I
â¢ < ould not deny myself a cup for break
fast. At the age of 36 I was in very J
poor health, indeed. My sister told me I i
vas in danger of becoming a coffee
drunkard.
"But I never could give up drinking
coffee for breakfast, although it kept
m<=- constantly ill, until I tried Postum.
I learned to make It properly according
to directions, and now we can hardly i
do without Postum for breakfast, and
care nothing at alt for coffee.
"I am no longer troubled with dys
pepsia, do not have spells of suffering
with my stomach that used to trouble
me so when I drank coffee." Name given

ROSSINI'S MASTERPIECE WELL SUfIG
wet night and an old opera, but a
house that would have overflowed the
3ld Tivoli and that comrortably filled
the new greeted "The Barber of Se
lille" last night. "Always gay and in
genious music," Schumann says of it,
and Rossini's laughing phrase lost
nothing last night in the performance.
It gained not so heavily as it might in
a few of its features, but there was joy
in heaven âniggerâand with the rest of
us, over most of it.
La Puma, as one surmised, had his
chance and took it as Figaro. The
barytone, whose Scarpia suggests an
impassioned dumpling, was an admir
able barber. He had neither the com
bined flre and fun of Gregorettiâstill
to me the best Figaro I have heardâ
nor the mercurial wit of Scotti, but he
has excellently the unctuous servility,
the commercial obligingness, the sly
ness of the barber. And Signor La
Puma sang to a turn. He is a thor
oughly artistic singer, wholly free from
exaggerations.and most agreeably sure,
and his smooth, resonant voice fulfilled
its promise of the night before. The
"Largo al Factotum" went delightfully,
and was hugely applauded.
The chief interest, of course, centered
in Tettrazzini, whose success here has
been of the sensational sort. The role
uf Rosina is one attempted by every
lyric soprano from Sembrich down.
Very far down is the next from Sem
brich, and Tettrazzini last night, suf
fering from a cold, did not elbow Sem
brich, as one ventured to think she
might. Very beautiful was some of her
work, and Signorina Tettrazzini Is as
brave and kind as she is gifted. It was
evidently difficult for her to sing, but
to the thunderous encores that came
after the. "music lesson" she responded
both graciously and generously. A
thoughtless section of the house would
still have asked for more, but was
hissed into reasonableness by the rest.
But the voice is indeed beautiful, and
me hopes that it will be in perfect
form again by to-night, when she will
repeat her Gllda,
Tettrazzini again showed herself a
clever actress, exhibiting both fun and
spirit as the willful Rosina. She sang
the "Carnival of Venice" as chief of
the music lesson songs.
Of the rest Signor Cervi gave a cap
ital Don Bartolo. His makeup as the
foolish old gentleman was high art
and his assumption of the character
throughout was delightfully droll. He
also brings much more voice to the
role than the usual buffo. Signorina
BettJnl's Bertha Is in the same class,
excellent character acting. She sings
little, but as the old lkdy exactly
enough. Then Signor Rossi made a
very favorable debut in De Reszke's
beloved part of Don Basilic Rossi is
almost as well upholstered as De
Reszke and further owns a fine, deep
basso. Like the rest, he was happy
in his part.
It la unusual to leave Almasrtva to
the last, but one here thinks of him
last. Signor Bazelll does not develop
overwhelmingly. In fact, his Alma
viva was by no means so good as his
Duke in "Rigoletto," either vocally or
In the acting.
Signor Longo conducted in a pleas
ing, unobtrusive fashion and was
pleasantly greeted.
This afternoon "La Tosca" will be
repeated and Berlendi should be
heard here, and to-night "Rigoletto."

FULL OF WORMS
Interesting Item in Report
of Four Years' Adminis
tration of Great Estate
An account of her Administration of
the vast estate of the late Adolph Sutro
for four years was filed yesterday by
his daughter, Dr. Emma L. Merritt, the
executrix. The document contains 352
typewritten pages and gives minute de
tails of the management of the varied
interests of the extensive property. The
Cliff House, the Heights, the forest, the
San Miguel rancho, the museum, the
baths, the lands and their tenants and
the employes, to say nothing of the
monetary matters and litigation, all
come in for full treatment under their
respective heads.
The report is made for the period be
ginning February 1, 1900, and ending
February 10, 1904. In the chapter on
the museum there are passages that
come under the heading of humorous.
It is set forth that the head of the
Egyptian .*phinx crumbled and fell on
August 29, 1903, and In the same year
"there were" a great many worms in
one of the Egyptian mummies," but
they were driven out by the use of cya
nide of potassium. Apparently a mum
my can stand a stronger dose than per
sons who have no need for an embalm
er. It is also reported that two of the
stuffed owls have been stolen, but tlie
culprit is not named.
Under the division on storms it is re
cited that the high winds blew shingles
from the Cliff House and broke many
panes of glass, and that the tops of the
fir trees *at the Heights have been
blown off. The trees on the San Miguel
rancho are said to have grown so much
that they interfere with each other and
must be thinned out.
From a great array of figures It is
gathered that sales of realty up to July,
1903. amounted to $500,583 50; legacies
paid up to July 28, 1903, amounted to
$288,962; claims amounting to $121,515 39
were allowed in 1900, and claims reject
ed In that year aggregated $73,409 31.
The receipts for the period covered by
the account, including a small amount
on hand, amounted to $845,530 37, and
the disbursements during the same
time were $827,022 76. The present value
of the estate is not given.

PRISONERS SET

Judge Cook Holds That He
Has Xo Jurisdiction in
Gutter Gold Brick Case
ALLEGED THIEF ESCAPES
Evidence Insufficient to Hold
Man Accused of Taking
Money From Mrs. Lundy
Two defendants who had been held
to answer by Police Judge Conlan se
cured their liberty yesterday on writs
of habeas corpus. Max Gutter was
held on a charge of obtaining money
by false pretenses. He was accused of |
passing a "gold brick" on B. Cohn of
the Crossley building on May 23, for I
which he received $1700. Judge Cook
held that the court had no jurisdiction j
as the representations were made in j
Oakland. The check, and gold br f ick |
were also delivered to Gutter in Oak- i
land. The jurisdiction is in Alameda
County and not here. It was true the
' gold brick" had been brought into
this city and county, but the statute
referring to stolen property could not
apply in this instance, as the property
was not stolen. The Judge added that
the defendant's discharge would be no
bar to his arrest and prosecution in
Alameda County.
The other case was that of Henry
Wisherd, who was held to answer on a
charge of grand larceny. He was ac
cused of stealing a purse from Mrs.
Thomas Lundy, wife of the well
known jeweler on Third street. Mrs.
Lundy was entering a car at Stevenson
and Fourth streets on December 26 to
go to the Cliff House when a man
jostled roughly against her and she
missed her purse. She called out to
her husband and son. who were with
her, and grabbed hold of Wisherd,
whom she accused of stealing her
purse. Wisherd protested his inno
cence and offered to allow them to
search him in a store. They went into
a store, when a man who represented ,
himself as a policeman entered and
searched Wisherd, immediately there
after taking his departure. It was
supposed that this man was a con
federate. Judge Dunne in granting
the writ and discharging the defend
and said the evidence was insufficient,
as no one saw htm take the purse and
there was nothing to show that the
purse had been lost at that time.

WINNING OF FIRST TWO-YEAR-OLD EVENT
SHOWS HER TO BE A HIGH-CLASS YOUNGSTER
TENNIS EXPERTS
READY FOR WORK
Annual Tournament of the Golden
Gate Qui. Will Be Inaug
urated To-Morrow.
The Golden Gate Tennis Club will '
open the 1905 season with a handicap
singles tournament in the park courts
to-morrow. A similar event was held
a year ago when Clarence Griffin
ried off the honors. This tournament
had a record-breaking entry list, reach- ;
lng 104. For some reason there has
been a decided falling off in the num
ber of players entered. About seventy
will compete to-morrow.
This, of course, is a very large entry,
but considerably smaller than last year.
The falling off is hard to account for I
because of the fact that tennis is be- j
corning more popular at the park each i
day. It is more than likely that the
decrease is due to the existence of a j
junior club. These boys conauct their i
own ttrunumtiits and as they number ,
about fifty the absence of many of I
them from the coming tournament j
probably accounts for the comparative
ly small entry list.
All best players at the park will be
in the competition and if the handicaps
are properly arranged there should be
Borne interesting matches. George
Baker, Clarence Griffin, R. N. Whitney,
Charles Duniap, Carl Gardner, Neil
Baker and Charles Foley will be the j
most heavily handicapped players.
Play will begin at 9 o'clock Sunday
and those not on hand when their
matches are called will be promptly de
faulted. The last eight players left in
the tournament will receive prizes.
The Ladies' Annex will hold a handi
cap singles tournament for third class
players on the public courts to-day.
It is rather unusual to give handl- j
caps in a class tournament, but the â 
players in this division are by no
means evenly matched and handicap j
conditions will undoubtedly make the i
matches closer and more interesting.
â  A handicap singles tournament for ,
the Cochran cup is scheduled for Janu- j
ary 28. The young ladies have - met j
three times in tournaments for this
trophy. Miss Van Vliet won the first j
two events and Miss Vera Crocker the i
third.
No tournaments are scheduled for the!!
California Club and unless the directors
put up cups for handicap doubles tour
neys it is doubtful If there will be a
contest before Washington's birthday, \
The last, three-time cups were won !
sooner than was expected, and as yet !
they have not been replaced. The club i
will undoubtedly put up new trophies, i
The directors will meet Tuesday night, !
when the matter will be decided. At i
this meeting the new by-laws will be
either adopted or rejected. The only i
serioro objection to them is the rule
that applies to school boys, but it is
not expected the opposition will be
strong enough to defeat them.
Now that the holiday tournaments
have been completed, interest in the
continuous tournament Is increasing.
In the first class there is a hot fight for
first place between George Janes and
W. B. Collier. The former has beaten
Collier three times, but the latter is as
determined as ever and still thinks he
can beat his younger opponent.

class. The former has already gone up
three numbers in the first class. He
has beaten Sherwood Adams, Chester
Smith and Herbert Long. Young Long
is improving more rapidly than any
member of the club and should soon be
near the top. The same may be said
of Gabriel, though he lias not met any
of the first class men yet. He is hard
ly as clever as Long, but can probably
beat some of the men in his class.
With Long and Gabriel out of the
second class but four players remain.
They are: Dv Val Moore, Paul Jones,
George Cutler and Dr. Younger. Al
Kenyon and Moulten Warner have no
difficulty keeping at the head of the
third class. Judge Troutt, having beat
en Kuehn, is now in this class. W. G.
Knowlton has climbed from No. 10 in
the fourth class to No. L
There is some talk of holding an in
door tournament at the Mechanics' Pa
vilion next month. This has been dis
cussed many times, but, like the project
of bringing the Western champions to
the coast, has fallen through. The plan
is to hold the tournament in conjunc
tion with other athletic games at the
game and forest show. An event of
this kind would excite little interest, r.s
it is frmpossible to play tennis outdoors
here all the year round. The indoor
tournaments in the East are success
ful because of the fact that the game
can be played in the open less than
half the year.
The committee in charge expedts to
hold a singles and doubles event. The
preliminary rounds of one are to be
played in the park courts and the other
at the Club courts.. The
final matches are to be played at the
pavilion.
Find Petrified Grain.
The drillers at work in a now deep
well at Junction City, Kans,, are find
ing all sorts of odd things. Recently
the drill penetrated a stratum of what
appeared to be petrified rye. The
grains were surprisingly like that ce
real and some one has suggested that
an ante-glacial elevator or storehouse
has been â¢ discovered.
Fire Guts Two Flats.
Fire broke out shortly after 1
o'c-ock yesterday moaning in the flat
occupied by COnrad Fey, 1822 Powell
street, and badly gutted the house and
the adjoining place. Policemen Healy
and McManus came to the rescue of
three women in the place and dragged
them out. The damage is about $1000.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, JANUARÂ¥ 14, 1905.
Carries the Colors
of Adolph B.
Spreckels.
Daruma, ridden by John Bullman,
captured the first two-year-old event
of the season, and straightway her sire,
Solitaire, became famous. Daruma
was bred at Napa Stock Farm and car
ried the colors of her owner, A. B.
Spreekels.
i Her sire was purchased in England
for Mr. Spreckels by the noted trainer,
Enoch Wishard. and Lester Reiff, tne
famous rider who piloted Solitaire in
some of his races on the other side,
pronounced him one of the greatest
horses he was ever astride. Since cap
turing the purse on January 2 Daruma
has twice suffered defeat.
On each occasion she was led past
the judges by Sir Wilfred, which ran
second to her the first time the pair
met. However, this Is no disgrace, for
Sir Wilfred is a colt possessed of phe
nomenal speed, and may be made of
championship timber.
PROPERTY OWNERS MUST
PAY SEWER ASSESSMENT
Supervisors Refuse to Make City Re
sponsible for Work on Pierce
Street Erroneously Accepted.
The Supervisors' Judiciary Commit
tee'yesterday denied the petition that
the city pay for the construction of a
sewer in Pierce street, between Gold
en Gate ave%ue and McAllister street.
The street was accepted erroneously
ten years ago. before the sewer was
built, and now the property owners
want to be relieved from the assess
ment and have the city stand the ex
pense in view of the full acceptance.
The petition requesting that Ship
ley street, from Elizabeth -place to
Ritch street, be expunged from the
official map was granted.
The committee allowed six demands
of Theodore Kytka for expert services
in criminal cases, one being for $82 50.
two for $35 each and the other three
lor $25 each.
The claim of Warner Temple for
damages caused by a defective sewer
on Mission street, between Mohawk
and Onondaga avenues, was denied.
The claim of Labrucherle Bros, for
$1680 for the value of cows Injured
by the collapse of a barn and confis

MA? BUILD NOT
ROAD FOR AUTOS
Drivers of Motor Cars Are
Anxious to Secure Better
Highways for Speed Tests
WANT MORE PRIVILEGES
Park Commissioners Will Be
Asked to Grant Conces
sions to the Chauffeurs
The annual dinner of the members of
the Automobile Club of Califoraia will
be held next month in this city. At a
meeting held early in the week In the
offices of R. P. Schwerin, president, it
was stated that the club has more than
250 members and that there are several
names on the waiting list. Its finances
are in good condition and it has no
debts. The possibility of constructing
a road near the city for the use of
automobilists exclusively is being con-
sldered, and plans have been prepared.
It is also proposed to put the road
leading down the peninsula along the
shore of the bay into a better condi
tion.
The directors of the cltfb have de
voted much energy to preventing the
adoption of a harsh ordinance in San
Mateo County, where a strong feeling
exists against automobllists on account
of the reckless, selfish behavior of a
few drivers of self-propelled carriages.
The club has brought a case into the
courts to test the legality of the strin
gent ordinance in force in Marin Coun
ty. It has also made a compilation of
the town and county laws regulating
the use of automobiles throughout the
State of California, and has endeavored
to have the mountain road between Los
Gatos and Santa Cruz opened to motor
ists. Information has been obtained
with regard to the rules as to the op
eration of automobiles in the public
parks of all towns in the United States
having a population of more than" 100,
--000. This will be brought to the atten
tion of the Park Commissioners of San
Francisco in the hope of persuading
them to grant a freer use of Golden
Gate Park to the drivers of motor cars.-
A bill defining the rights of automobil
ists will be prepared by a committee of
the club and will be presented to the
State Legislature. The adoption of a
well-considered law regulating the use
of automobiles and defining the legal
status of their owners and operators
would be a great boon, as its provisions
would be effective all oves. the State.
At present the Supervisors of each
county frame ordinances, which in
many cases are inequitable and vary
greatly in their requirements. It will
be much easier to understand and con
form to the provisions of a reasonable
law In force throughout California than
to learn the various conflicting require
ments of nearly sixty counties. 9
Not Looking for Trouble.
A petitioner, who describes himself
as "a citizen, a taxpayer and a voter."
ccmplained to the Works Board yes
terday that dangerous obstructions
exist on the north side of Eddy street,
between Leavenworth and Hyde. He
asks that they be removed. The peti
tioner says he does not sign his name
because "I do not want to be set upon
and beaten by a thug or have to shoot
him in self-defense."

NATIVE HARES
HARD TO. FIND
Coursing Men Are at Wits'
Ends to Secure Rabbits
for Sport on the Sward
FAMINE IS THREATENED
Union Park Will Not Open
To-Morrow, so Ingleside
Is Center of Attraction
Coursing men are facing a serious
crisis at the present time. Hares are
scarce and the demand cannot be met
by the men who have supplied the fleet
footed animals to the coursing parks In
the past. Something will have to be
done soon or there will be no sport on
the sward In San Francisco, for a while
at least.
The" managers of Union Coursing
Park say that it has been nearly im
possible for them to secure hares with-
in the last two months. Hunters in the
south have been killing the rabbits off
at an alarming, rate and selling them
for $2 25 a dozen. Consequently almost
the entire southern country has been
stripped of the little fellows, and the
coursing men now find themselves in
dire want.
It is likely that they will begin to im
port hares from Oregon , soon. The
jacks are reported to be plentiful in the
northern country, and the coursing
promoters say they will be forced to re
sort to importation in order to keep
the game going. At the present time
neither park has a sufficient supply of
hares on hand.
Ingleside will have full sway to-mor
row. The Union management announced
that their park would not open on Sun
day, and it may be closed for a longer
space of time unless the game looks up
a bit. Ingleside has two stakes on the
card to-morrow, and as there is no op
position in the field the park should en
joy a good day. especially as some clev
er hounds are carded to run. â¢
The managers of Ingleside claim that
there will be no more trouble with the
owners of the dogs. A truce has been
declared, and unless dissatisfied
member makes more trouble everything
is scheduled to glide along smoothly.
There are so many men running dogs
at the present time that it is impossi
ble for each to get a chance at the
game every Sunday, so some of them
are bound to get sore.
CALIFORNIA IS ' WARM
WHILE OREGON FREEZES
Coast Gets Storms With High Winds,
and More Bad Weather Is
Promfsed.
The Webfocters who say that from
a climatic standpoint "Portland is
about the same as San Francisco"
will be interested to learn that in the
Oregon metropolis yesterday the snow
fell continuously, the temperature
was three degrees below the freezing
point and the wind blew forty miles
an hour, while in the city of the Gold
en Gate there was a light rain and the
mercury was 56 degrees above zero.
The precipitation in this city was
.10 of an inch. The wind was mod
erate in town, but very heavy off
shore. The barometer at Cape Men
docino read 29.76 yesterday, and in
San Francisco 30.14, showing a re
markable gradient from a meteorolog
ical standpoint.
Professor McAdie predicts rain and
high winds for California to-day.
HUNTERS ENJOY SPLENDID
SHOOTING ON MARSHES.
BEST SEASON IN YEARS
QUAIL ARE HARD TO FIND
Duck hurrTers are having a great
time now. Not in years has such a
season as the present been known. In
nearly all the principal retreats, can
vasback, teal, sprig, widgeon and other
varieties are to be found and few hunt
ers return home without bagging the
limit, which is fifty, birds in every
county save Sonoma.
The same cannot be said of quail.
Sportsmen vow that such a bad sea
son has never been known in the his
tory of the sport in this Stale. The
birds are not to be found. Every man
who goes out in quest of the dainty
ones returns with a disgusted look on
his face and swears he will not take a
chance again unless he Is guaranteed a
good sized bag.
Around Marysville all. kinds of ducks
are to be found and hunters say that it
is dead easy to secure a bag there.
William Rix made a business trip to
the town the other day and for recrea
tion went out for a few hours' shoot.
He returned with nineteen big ones in
a short space of time and said other
gunmen did even better.
Sunday was an especially good day
for ducks in all the nearby marshes.
Nearly every hunter who went out re
turned with a full bag. experiencing lit
tle difficulty in knocking them down
with regularity. From present indica
tions, to-morrow will be another ban
ner day and most of the boys are pre
paring for the fray.
Along the Alameda marshes, .the
sport is said to be great. The members
of the Alameda Gun Club have been
having a great time on the marshes,
all of them securing good bags. At
Suisun the birds are better than in any

CHICAGO ABOUT BADDELEY
Pugilist Johnson Swears to Complaint
Charging Him With Threatening
to Kill His Wife". "
Robert Johnson, the pugilist, who
lives at 740 Howard street, swore to a
complaint yesterday afternoon charg
ing Benjamin Baddeley with threats
against life. Johnson alleges that on
December 20 Baddeley threatened to
kill Mrs. Minnie Johnson, complain
ant's wife. Baddeley was later booked
on the charge at the City Prison,
where he has been confined since Tues
day. His bonds were fixed at $1000.
Baddeley had sworn out a warrant
for Mrs. Johnson's arrest on a charge
of bigamy and she accused him of
being one of "Black Joe" Palmer's
gi'ng of train robbers, with headquar
ters in St. Louis. It was the intention
of Captain Burnett to release Baddeley
yesterday afternoon, as he had r\ot re
ceived any word from Detective
O'Keefe of the Illinois Central Rail
road, Chicago, who was supposed to be
in possession of papers that would cor
roborate Mrs. Johnson's charge against
Bi.ddeley. Detective Matheson had
also been unable to fasten any
hold-ups in this city or Oakland upon
Baddeley.
Captain Burnett notified Johnson of
his intention and the warrant charging'
Baddeley with threatening to kill Mrs.
Johnson was the result. The- charge
of bigamy against Mrs. Johnson is
pending in Police Judge Mogan's
court.

ly that place has attracted hundreds <->r
hunters since the season opened. Along
the Alviso marshes the sport is excel
lent, many good bags having been se
cured last week.
At San Pablo and Pinole the sport is
also looking up. The birds are not as
large there as they might be, but they
are to be found in abundance. Can
vasback are especially plentiful. Near
Lakeside, in Sonoma County, canvas
back swarm in large numbers, several
of the local hunters having secured
good bags there last week.
Ed Bowen and Lee Cunel secured ths
limit at Petaluma Creek last Sunday.
They said the place was fairly alive
with all kinds of duck and many hunt
ers from this city were in evidence. E.
Gamble and William Schindel bagged
nearly the limit in the same place. Otto
Feudner made a trip to San Pablo on
Sunday and came home with twenty
eight big canvasbacks. He was highly
pleased with his day's work.
W. Hoffman and J. Muller brought
down forty-two of various varieties at
the same place. Clarence Nauman
made a trip to Los Banos the other day.
He came home with a big bag of as

Xo Fear of Trouble Between
Pacific Coast League and
the National Association
RUMORS NOT AUTHENTIC
August Herrmann Says Mag
nates Did Not Intend to
Reopen the Tacoma Draft
There will be no war between the Pa
cific Coast Baseball League and the
National Association. That was made
clear yesterday afternoon, when Presi
dent Eugene Bert of the coast organi
sation received a telegram from Aug
ust Herrmann of Cincinnati, chairman
of the national board, stating that the
Eastern magnates did not intend to re
open the draft on the Tacoma team.
According to Herrmann the whole af
fair was nothing but talk. He says in
his dispatch that the trouble was
caused by the newspapers of the East
when they printed a long story stating
that the draft on the Tacoma team
. would be reopened and every good man
on the list taken away from Mike
Fisher.
Herrmann added that the magnates
did not want war and that none of
them were in favor of drafting on Ta
coma save the managers of the De
troit team. They were anxious to take
some of the Tacoma players away from
the Pacific Coast League and made a
move to have the draft reopened. This
â undoubtedly started the story that the
national board was about to authorize
the raiding of Fisher's band.
The magnates of the Pacific Coast
are perfectly satisfied with the present
arrangements, and so long as they are
, given an even break they will not at
tempt to pull out of the association.
Mike Fisher expresses himself as befffg,
satisfied with the deal and will not talk
war unless his team is about to be
raided.
For a while the managers of the coast
league were of the opinion that trouble
would occur. They received no notifica
tion that the draft on the Tacoma team
would be reopened, but heard the ru
mors and took them In good faith. The
â¢ National Association is not benefiting
the coast league In any way, and the
home magnates would be willing to
break away upon the slightest provoca
â¢ tion.
The election of "Tip" O'Neill to the
presidency of the Western > League
â means a whole lot for this organiza
tion. O'Neill is an Oakland man and
has- the affairs of the Pacific Coast
League at heart. He is a star of tho
olden days and knows every player and
manager in the country. His presence
in the Middle West will do much to
ward protecting the coast league, and
if there is to be trouble O'Neill will be
ori hand to represent Californians.

VAN'AR5DALE'S GREAT DOGS"
FIR5T IN TWO BIG EVENTS
Harm H, Captures All
Age Event, Defeat
ing Cuba Jr.
BY ASSHETON SMYTH.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BAKERSFIELD, Jan. 13.âThe prin
cipal eventsvat the field trials were con
cluded to-day when representatives of
the kennels of W. W. Van Arsdale car
ried off all the honors. In the cham
pion stake, his great pointer. Dr.
Daniels, defeated Lady, while in the
all-age event his English setter, Harry
H, defeated Cuba Jr.
The champion dogs have to run two
hours under the rules and must have
been placed previously in a recognized
field trial. Dr. Daniels and Lady out
classed Cuba Jr. and Kilgarif. In de
ciding this stake H. W. Keller of
Santa Monica acted with Judge Bet
ten by invitation. The spectators were
surprised at the decision in the all-age
event. The opinion prevailed that first
and second place rested between Keep
sake and Ladylike. A decision placing
either first and Harry H third would
have been satisfactory. Leaving so
high class a dog as Keepsake out of
the money and placing Cuba Jr. and
Harry H in it was considered inde
fensible.
Dr. Daniels, the winner of the cham
pion stake, is by Plain Sam-Dolby D
the Second. Lady, the runner-up, is
by Count Gladstone tne fourth-Peach
Mark. Harry H. winner ot the all-age,
is by Why Not-Sue. The runner-up.
Cuba Jr., is by Cuba of Kenwood-Stel
la. Ladylike and Jay M were placed
equal third. The trials will be con
cluded to-morrow with the running of
Members' stake. The entries are H. W.
Keller's setter, Sombra, with J. W.
Flynn's pointer, Romp On; Hugh Hop
kins' setter, Rosa Ohm, with J. M.
Donlev's setter, Monterey; Rose and
Chrlstenson's setter, Belle Fontai ie a
bye.
HARRY H DECLARED WINNER.
The first brace put down in the all
age stake was Cuba Jr. and Harry H.
Both dogs w%nt away with good speed
and ranged out widely, Larry H hav
ing somewhat the best of it in both
these particulars. Casting over on the
edge of a little swale Cuba Jr. ran close
to a small bevy of quail, which he
stopped on as they flushed. His hand
ler claimed it as a point, but It was
considered a questionable one. Follow
ing this Cuba Jr. made fine points, to
which no birds were raised. , Harry H
failed to locate any birds in this heat,
but his splendid speed, range and man
ner of going classed him above his
competitor.
Sombra and Jay M were put down a
little farther to the south. Here also
few birds were found. Jay M made
three points to Sombra's one. The work
of this brace could not be characterized
as of high quality.
Moving to another field Avalon and
Uncle Jimmy Whitesides were cast off.
In some high weeds Uncle Jimmy se
cured three points. Later, moving up
on to tne higher ground, both dogs ran
into a small bevy, not locating before
they flushed and paying but little at
tention to them afterward. Later each
dog singly secured one point. While
Uncle Jimmy Whitesides went away
with good speed at the beginning of the
heat, he slowed down noticeably before
its termination, although it lasted but
thirty minutes.
Driving over to the section back of
the Canfleld schoolhouse. where a large
bevy of birds had been found each day
and where more points have been made
than in any other locality, those two
grand little setters, Keepsake and
Ladylike, were then put clown. They
gave an exhibition, greatly enjoyed by
the spectators, of rapid and high-class
work.
DOGS POINT TOGETHER.
In less than one hundred yards from
where they were taken out of their
crates, both running at a clipping gait
and about twenty yards apart, one
passed up on each side of a small bevy
of eight or ten birds and both simul
taneously snapped into a stylish point
with the birds between them. On
singles. Keepsake was the flrst to point,
followed in a few minutes by a second,
which possibly she flushed by moving
too close to. Ladylike then roaded a
couple of running birds to a flush.
A few minutes later she pointed
another single, cleverly backed by
Keepsake. The performance was dup
licated soon after. Keepsake, casting
off to the right and going with that
terrific gait she always maintains
whether looking for bevies or hunting
single, pointed four or five birds, but
broke in, flushed and attempted to
chase. '
While Ladylike was standing upon a
point some distance away, Keepsake's
handier sent her up to back, something
she had heretofore always dons
promptly, but on nearing Ladylike she
ran In front of her, taking the point,
Ther* is possibly a question whether
or not she saw the pointing dog. At
the close of this heat Judge Betten an
nounced the winner.
The flrst brace of the Champion Stake
was J. E. Terry's lemon and white set
ter, Terry's Lady, handled by W. B.

AMATEUR SKATERS MERGED
INTO ONE ASSOCIATION
NEW YORK. Jan. 13.âAmateur
skating organizations of the country
have been brought into one body at the
annual meeting here of the National
Amateur Skating Association of the
United States.
This means a membership of nearly
10.000 skaters and carries forward the
work begun by the late "Father Hill"
Curtis several years ago. The trebling
of the old membership was accomplish
ed by the affiliation of the American
Skating Association and the BU:ipner
Athletic Club, both of Chicago, the for
mer governing body of the West, and
the Canadian Skating Association.
Officers were re-elected as follows:
President, Harry Buermeyer of the
New YcfVk Athletic Club; vice presi
dent, Jerome Karst, St. Louis Skating
Club; secretary-treasurer, Francis M.
Clark*Â», Westchester Skating Club.
Sanctions for the nationarÂ»champion
ships and other meetings were award
ed. The national indoor championship
was scheduled for the Duquesne rink,
Pittsburg, Pa.: national outdoor cham
pionship, at Verona Lake, N. Y. The
Illinois outdoor championship goes to
Chicago. Practically every skating or
ganization in the country had a dele
gate present or was represented by
a proxy.
to run under the rules a heat of two
hours' duration they were worked over
a great deal of country, most of
which was covered 1 efore any birds
were found.
DR. DANIELS' GREAT WORK.
Dr. Daniels approaching a piece of
high c over began roading, but the birds
flushed before he was close enough to'
puint. Following the flushed birds Dr.
Daniels then began to get In his dead
ly work and soon placed to his credit
a score of a dozen points. Lady in the
meantime made four or five points
from which no bird was raised before
she began to positively locate the birds.
After this her point work was consid
erably better, scoring some half dozen
good points. Even though the first
part of the afternoon was warm both
dogs maintained their speed well to the
end of their two-ho race. Dr. Dan
iels was somewhat the faster.
At the end of this heat luncheon was
served from wagons in the field, which
keftt, following until the heat ended. Af
ter a hurried repast J. E. Terry's black,
white and tan English setter, Kilgarif,
handled by W. B. Coutts, and Stock
dale Kennels' liver and white pointer,
Cuba Jr., handled by R. m. Dodge,
were put down in another field. After
a long run, in which both dogs got out
well, Cuba Jr. found and pointed a
small bevy, followed by two single
points later on and two more from
which no birds were raised. Kilgarif
also found and pointed a small bevy
and made five more singles. He maiÂ»>
tamed his pace much better than Cuba,
although long before the race was fin
ished both dogs showed evidence that
two hours was too much for them.
SELLING PLATERS FURNISH SOME CLEVER SPORT
Albemarle Beats
Halnault and
Bell Reed.
Tennyliurn, Bull
man Up, a
Winner.
BY FRED E. MFLHOLLAND.
Even if the track across the bay yes
terday did resemble the Oakland es
tuary more than an ellipse for racing
purposes and the card was a trifle off
colored, the sport itself did not pan out
so poorly after all. Most of the horses
backed were fighting for the money,
and the betting seemed lively as ever.
Although Sit Preston and Alice Carey
were the only two successful choices,
Albemarle, Al Waddle. War Times and
Tennyburn were by no means neglect
ed.
The faildown of Royal Red. the 11
to 10 favorite for the maiden three
year-old sprint, caused sorrow among
the talent. The Toukey entry was
heralded as â  good thing, and Bullman
on Tennyburn beat the gelding out a
length. The favorite might have been
returned first had Helgesen astride
Phalanx not interfered with him re
peatedly. In a hard drive he disposed
of Phalanx by a head for the place.
Had McÃride winked or glanced at
the" grandstand while finishing with
Sir Preston, odds-on favorite for the
opening sprint, his mount would have
been beaten. The first choice is not
the horse he was, for Georgle Black, a
30 to 1 shot, outfooted him until well
into the stretch. Then the outsider be
gan tiring, and under hard urging Sir
Preston earned a head decision over
Pure Dale, the mount of Bell. Molto
quit early.
Many thought McÃride on Bell Reed,j
favorite tor the six furlong selling af
fair following, put up a listless sort of
finish. Perhaps he did, but the form;
book will show that Bell favors a
shorter route than six furlongs. With:
ten pounds less than he -carried in his
preceding race Albemarle rooked best
and there is little wonderment that he
received backing at SVj to 1, Kunz got
away in front with the latter, the fav
orite trailing under partial restraint.!
Approaching the wire, McÃride let the
favorite down â¢ and Davis made a bid
for it with Halnault, and the backed
one. It was a pretty finish, Albemarle
scoring by a head, Halpault second, a
nose before Bell Reed. Educate ran a
dull race under her light weight.
Ten very cheap maidens started in
the mile event. A very warm clocksr's
tip caused The Volt, ridden by Davis,
to close favorite. The mare met with
some early interference, running un
placed. Jakle Jones brought Al
Waddle fourth place and, over
hauling the leader, Lucrece, in the
stretch, won by a length. Jack Habert
splashed through the bunch from back
In thÂ«sjau!k. securing the show.
War Times received backing to defeat
Scherzo, favorite for the mile and sev
enty yard selling fixture, and did it.
Bonner piloted the winner, taking the
lead from Vlgoroso on the far turn.
Bullman landed in second place with
the flrst choice, downing Vigoroso three
lengths. Harka and Gin Spray could
not raise a gallop In the going.
Alice Carey proved she Is a good re
peater by capturing the closing event
on 'the card, at seven furlongs. Alarie
again rode the mare, and after getting
away last assumed the front position
on the far turn. In the stretch Sam
Greenfield put in a bid with Lady Kent,
but the leader held her safe, getting
the verdict by less than a length in a
whipping finish. Red Cross Nurse
strolled leisurely Into third place. The
two leaders closed equal favorites in
the betting.
TRACK NOTES.
John Bullman rode a very strong
finish on Tennyburn. The colt was
well played in the downtown pool
rooms. * .
Red Cross Nurse was claimed from
the last race for ?R25 by the Fleur
de Lis stable, in whose colors Alice
Carey can.
Walter Jennings sold the three
year-old filly Estella J to the Baker
City stable yesterday.
Wally Brinkworth has played in such
poor luck that he figures a change
may prove beneficial. The stable of
horses in which he is interested will
be shipped to Hot Sprinss on Monday
next. Little Wally. Silverskln and
Scotsman are the pick of the string.
Wally will be missed, for he is an
extensive speculator and an all around
good fellow. Frank Doss, who trains
for the stable, had the horses fit as
hands could make them, but they just
simply bumped up against it.
Tom Renly, the well known Eastern
trainer, was a visitor at the track
yesterday. He is accompanied on the
trip West by John Weiler, another
New Yorker. Mr. Henly trains the
horses owned by R. T. Wilson Jr..
Dolly Spanker being one of the stars.

POWELL LOSES
TO CHOYNSKI
Lew Is Nearly Knocked Out
in the Second Rourid, but
Gong Comes to His Rescue
Lew Powell's ambition to enter the
professional ranks and mix It with the
top-notchers at 130 pounds was given a
sad setback last night at Woodward's
Pavilion when he met Young Choynski
before the Hayes Valley Athletic Club.
Powell lost the decision in one of the
fastest four rounds ever witnessed in
that rinjj: That Powell was not knock
ed out was due to the gentle sound of
the gong in the second round. After
being knocked down several times he
staggered around the ring in a helpless
condition, all but out when the bell
rang.
In the flrst round honors were about
even. Choynski crouched and scored
frequently with a left Jab, whicM
brought a free flow of blood from Pow
ell's nose. Lew was fighting cleverly
and scored some lefts and an occasional
right cross to his opponent's head.
During the middle of the second,
after some furious mix-ups, Choynski
landed a short right on Lew's Jaw,
which sent him sprawling to the floor.
He did not take the count, but regained
his feet, but he was helpless. He went
to the floor again from a right swing.
Powell showed his gameness in the
third by fighting Choynski around the
ring. He sent in his left and right with
unerring accuracy and had Choynski
on Queer street when the gong sound
ed. The last round was full of fighting,
with honors fairly even until near the
end, when Choynski again scored a

HOW WAYWARD
LADS ARE LED
Boys of Parental School Are
Formally Paroled, Having
Abandoned â¢'Hookey" Habit
SUCCESS ATTENDS WORK
Urgent Need for Refuge for
Children From Demoraliz
ing Influences at Home
BY LAURA BRIDE POWERS.
. Men and women of San Francisco, ye
who count yourselves good citizens and
good Christians, take a half-hour off
some dull day and go down to the little
Parental School on Harrison street, at
Eighth, and you'll see some things that
will make you think; perhaps make
you act, tooâthat is, if your brain be
of the type that's "there" and acta in
unison with your heart.
Yesterday morning Superintendent
Langdon of the city schools, Alfred
Roneovieri, president of the Board of
Education, and Directors A. Altniann
and Thomas F. Boyle presented them
selves at the Parental School for the
eagerly-looked-for parole servlcje, Judge
Murasky being unable to attend.
Twelve boys who had been sent to the
Parental School for truancy or other ir
regularity had so conducted themÂ»elves
as to be ready to return to their own
schools and proceed with their classes
as ordinary pupils.
The process of paroling Is invested
with much formality, all the lads in the
school being assembled to observe the
reward that follows good conduct âand
they don't miss a word, not they!
The boys that had yielded to the
methods of the school and been de
clared by Principal Faulkner ready for
parole were lined up for honors, and
encouraging admonition was given
them by the visiting school men. Yes,
the lads listened, and appeared to en
joy the talks, for they are learning to
know that the attitude of the School
Board is friendly and helpful, as is that
of the special teachers and of Principal
Faulkner. This feeling is of supremest
importance in the successful outcome
of this process of citizen-building, for
heretofore the teachers and other at
taches of the school were ranked with
the "cops"âthe eternal enemies of "de
gang.'' And it is only by an establish
ment of confidence and friendship that
these lads are held in school, where
they now come voluntarily every Â«day,
thereby depriving the neighbors and
the police of many immediate troubles
and the city government of much ex
pense.
PROUD OF CERTIFICATES.
Eagerly the twelve lads scanned the
certificates that entitled them to return
to their old schools, and twelve happier
lads couldn't be found than they, for
they now bore certificates of good char
acter. It Is this ambition for a good
reputation that the school seeks to in
culcate, and does Inculcate.
What type of boys? Well, mostly
from poor, disorganized homes, and of
parentage steeped In vice and drink.
On many of the faces is stamped the
story of degradation, presumably im
pressed thereon prenatally, and not
erased by environment.
I recall two boys of one familyâand
there are many cases where two mem
bers of the same family are in the
school. Their parents are both habit
ual drunkards, whose few sober hours
are usually spent In jail,"after a family
combat, or In the hospital. These lads
are not vicious, nor are they even boy
ishly tad, but they will run away from
home at night, and who can blame
them! Hence their presence before
Judge Murasky of the Juvenile Court,
who committed them to the Parental
School.
Now, here's a proposition. What can
be done with children of such vicious
surroundings, during the few hours of
school discipline, let it be of the highest
and best order? Assuredly but little,
un/ess the school be supplemented with
a Parental Home, and that's the thing
that's needed to perfect the good, work
thus begun in San Francisco, and suc
cessfully In operation in Eastern cities.
Such a home means the expenditure
of money; it means Â»n appropriation
for this special purpose by the Board
of Supervisors when the city oudget
is made up.
POINT FOR SUPERVISORS. .
It's a hard thing to induce the Super
visorsâor any other body of business
menâto part with money for an experi
ment. And the Parental Home is an
experimentâhere. But if the guard
ians of the public treasury could be
cajoled into visiting the Parental
School, to observe the work there be
gun, there isn't a man among themâ
and I know them allâwho would refuse
to appropriate funds for the urgently
needed Parental Home. Here's to the
hope that they may get down there, to
see and know the work for themselves!
An interesting fact was presented at
the school yesterday, which I almost
forgot to mentionâthat of the last
batch of boys paroled Aye were after
ward at school every day, and three
"played hookey" from one to two days,
which was a pretty good showing.
These statistics were supplied by the
lads themselves (with more or less re
luctance by the backsliders), and are
confirmed by official reports. It all
shows progress.
Under the belief that "it is wiser and
less expensive to save children than to
punish criminals " let us hope that the
men who shape the finances of the city
will provide funds for the proper train
ing of the city's delinquent children,
from whose ranks criminals are Te
cruited.
PRESS CLUB GIVES
RECEPTION TO RIIS
Brilliant Lecturer, Author and New
York Police Reporter Talks of
Metropolitan life.
The life and work of a newspaper
man in New York during the strenu
ous-- anti-Lexow times was the subject
of an informal talk given In the rooms
of the Press Club last evening by Ja
cob A. Riis, the well-known social
economist, author anl lecturer, and
who for twenty-five years was a police
reporter for divers New York news
papers. Mr. Riis was the guest of
honor at an informal reception by the
members of the club. He faced a
large audience of literary and news
paper men.
Mr. Riis told of his early desperate
attempts to break into the newspaper
life and of the strenuous work he had
to do to stay there after he had won
a foothold. He recalled the many
big "stories" that developed during
the time he was a police reporter in
the days before the telephone, when
the newsgatherer had to contend with
difficulties of communication.
The talk concluded with a short and
unassuming account of the work dona
by the lecturer for the betterment of
the poor of the city and for improve
ment of municipal government. He
spoke enthusiastically of the work of
Theodore Roosevelt while at the head
of the New York Police Commission.

Invitation to the Visiting
Bricklayers and Masons
Several matters of Importance to
the organization and to union labor in
general were discussed at the session
cf the Bricklayers' and Masons' Con- |
vention yesterday afternoon. There |
was an average attendance of dele
gates, all of whom took much interest
in the proceedings.
W. R. Rodgers of Denver, Colo.; E. !
J. Whitney cf West Tampa, Fla., and
Samuel Lord of New York City were !
appointed a special committee at the j
session yesterday of the Bricklayers* j
and Masons' Convention to draft reso- ;
lutions favoring the seating of Alva \
Adams, whom the Democrats of Coi- j
orado declare to have been elected
Governor of that State.
A resolution was introduced by Dele
gate Gill of New York Union No. 37
to clear Patrick Mulligan, a member of
the same union, from the charge of
extortion made against him. Mulligan
was tried in a New York court, and the
charges are said to have been of such
a flimsy nature that the Judge in
structed the jury to acquit Mulligan,
which it did. The. convention adopted
Gill's resolution and ordered that a
copy of charges be spread upon
the records and published in the jour
nal as reprehensible and pernicious.
Rear Admiral McCalla extended an
invitation to the delegates to visit Mare
Island. It was accepted, and the mem
ber* will visit the island on Monday.
A resolution was adopted expressing i
sorrow for the death of Brother Kin
kalley, who died on January 1. He was
a loyal member of the union and a del
egate at the last convention.
The convention will hold a session
this mornirfg. The afternoon will be |
spent in pleasure, as a trolley ride
around the city has been arranged for
the delegates.

ALL OR NONE
OF THE PACTS
WASHINGTON, Jan. 18.âThe Senata
to-day made public the letter of the
President to the Senate regarding the
arbitration treaties sent to the Senate
December 13, 1904. The letter la aa fol
lows:
These conventions do not go so fax as I could
wish In scope and object, but they form, taken
together, a very Important step in the progress
of the world toward a policy of peaceful so
lution of such difficulties as cannot conven
iently he settled by diplomatic negotiations.
Their very limitations, which seem objection
able to many advocates of a policy of arbi
tration, are not without compensating advan
tages. They commit none of the contracting
parties to any action in opposition to their
national Interests, their policy or their aspira
tions. Their principal value Is that they con
stitute a considerable advance In the direc
tion of the purpose so ardently desired, of the
reign of universal peace and good will.
No discrimination has been made among
the powers signatory to The Hague conven
tion who have desired to enter into these
friendly relations, and It would be undesirable
from the standpoint of what this Government
is striving to accomplish to make any such
discrimination. I should not willingly ex
charge ratifications with any of the powers
unless the series of conventions as a whole
should meet with the favorable consideration
of the Senate.

'â¢ Now York Stock Market.
â¢ YEW. YORK, Jan. I.:.âThe Ceeble oscilla
tion*, to which tne price movement in the
market has now fallen were In an up
ward 'direction to-day. There were various
nominal explanations tor the new direction
of the- movement, but User* waa warrant foi
tiicâ¢belief that the real reason was the aim
pie, one that prices had moved downward yes
terday,. .In the preaer.t torpid state of the
piibHc Interest in the markri the professional
traderai' whose operations masts tip the deal-
Inga.. have no taste for fella wing prices far
lh jelfher direction, hence the shortness of
the.* 5 vibrations. The opening tranaactiona
s'liowed -more animation Â»â¢â <.â : vigor than for
ai\'Â«ral days past, but ;n..a' of the day's total
dialings were included it; the first and last
-hours..of the trading. A number of favorite
shocks in the outside market maintained their
yaisÃlt predominant interest to-day, and their
nivivements were the determining influence
tapon those of a number of atocks on the
Btoejk Hxchange itaelf. Northern Securities
and Interborough Rapid Tranalt both ahot up
Vio'jentry to new high recorda. with correapond
lng .effei't'on their allied stocks on the Stock
Jpxr.hange. â¢ In the volume of their capitaliza
ble*!' ' and â¢in their representative character
these stocks, of course, rank with the lm-
Siriar.t market leaders on the Stock Exchange
itself,. a4though they have never been listed
pit' dealing on the exchange. With the re
â Btrtcjed facilities of the outside market and
with the necessary laxity of the regulations
â¢and- conditions governing the trading there the
'pri.es made on purchases and Bales of atocka
In -t.bat 'market can scarcely be said to have
-the'-authority which attaches to business con
â ducted under the strict regulations existing
on the Stock Exchange. But the response in
.the local UtacttoM and in the transcontinental
group to-day waa sufficient evidence that the
dealings In the curb market were an Influence
: on-those stocks. Published reports of a plan
-to Combine all the local traction companies
were -responsible for the movement In Inter
btfough, while the buoyant rise in Northern
Securities occasioned estimates of the relative
increase in value resulting for the stocks ot
;UÂ» constituent companies and of the enhance
[â¢jhe'nt in value of Union Pacific holdings of
'.vrrtnem Securities. The movement in the
real of the market aeemed to be to a large
'.extant- sympathetic. There was an advance
ju-the price of refined sugar and It waa ru
rod that the Reading net earnings for
*L.>eÂ«ember would make a very atrong showing.
.'P.tetiing exchange waa ellghtly easier, but
ralliedâ  before the cloae and London dlacounta
e-ere, nfarked up a fraction, promising no re
laxation in the foreign demand for gold. The
foreign trade atatemerJt for December showed
i.declfne in value ot domestic exports of up
ward of- $38,000. om>, thus helping to explain
inn supply ot foreign exchange.
'â¢Jbe strength tv-day continued to center

Future Grain and Provisions.
CHICAGO, Jan. 13.âSentiment In the
wheat pit throughout the entire session was
bearish. At the opening May was off %Â®%c
to %Â®%c at $1 15%@1 16%. The Initial
weakness was due largely to a sharp decline
at Liverpool, resulting from bearish reporta
aa to crorta Tn Argentina. Another factor,
however, which had considerable Influence was
the well protected condition of winter wheat
in the United States, reports from the West i
the Southwest being unanimous in the aaser- I
tlon that the heavy snow of the past foaty- '
eight hours would be a great benefit to the
crop. Bulls found little to encourage them In
the cash altuation, there being only* a light
demand for cash wheat In all d'rectiona A
rumor that a cargo of California wheat had
been refused In Europe and ordered seat back
to America was an additional source of die- .
comfort to them. About the only Item of bull
ish tenor was the continued light receipts in
the Northwest. After trading waa well under
way the market rallied somewhat on fairly
liberal purchases by a leader of the longs.
May advanced to " 16%Â®1 16%. When this
support was withdrawn the market yielded to
the general bearlshnesa. May dropping to
$1 15%. Some recovery waa made on renewed
buying by the same operator, but the market
closed easy. Final quotations on May were
at $1 16%Â®1 16% c. a net loss of %c.
Smalt receipts and light country acceptances '
furnished the incentive of fair buying of
corn by commission houses, resulting Tn a
firm market. May cloaed at 44%Â®44%c.
Flrmneaa in corn had a steadying effect on
the oat market. May closed at the highest
point, 31%@31%c.
The provision market experienced conaider
able revival of interest, trading to-day being
of a fairly large volume. At the close May
pork and ribs were each up 7%c and lard was ,
5c higher.

Butter. Cheese and Eggs.
Rutter was no lower yesterday, and in fact
some houses reported the goods moving off
rather more freely and stocks less excessive,
while the feeling was rather steady than other
wise. Quotations showed no change. Cheese
remained as previously quoted.
There was another slight, decline In ranch
Eggs and the advertisement of a large retail
department store, offering them at 30c, helped
the decline along. Store Eggs, though not
much lower, were weak, as arrivals are In
creasing and they have to compete with two
or three cars of cold-storage Eastern Eggs
which came to hand yesterday and which were
offered at the quotations below. This is the
season of the year for Eggs to decline, and
j they are merely following the regular annual
t course of the market.

He registered under the name of B.
H. Webster, gave his residence as the
Presidio and then unfolded to the clerk
at the Occidental a story of his pro
posed marriage to a Los Angeles belle.
He wanted the best suite of rooms in
the hostelry, and having carefully in
spected them the stranger informed the
clerk that his llancee and her mother
â¢would arrive the following morning on
the Owl from the south. The prospec
tive groom arranged for having the
bridal apartments decorated with flow
ers, leased the hotel parlors for the
nuptial ceremony, engaged a carriage
to. meet his future wife and her mother
at the depot on their arrival from Los
Angeles and Anally completed the
preparations for his marriage by going
to a telephone and engaging a well
known clergyman to perform the cere
mony in the Occidental Hotel parlors
at 11 o'clock yesterday morning.
When yesterday morning came Man
ager Hooper and a force of employes
carefully arranged and decorated the
bridal apartments and cleared the big
parlor for the wedding. Shortly before
the arrival of the Owl train a carriage
was dispatched to the depot. Manager
Hooper and the clergyman, who had
arrived in advance of the expected
couple, sat themselves down in one of
the cozy corners of the hotel and quiet
ly discussed ecclesiastical matters. Half
an hour later the carriage driver re
turned to the Occidental and calling
Manager Hooper aside poured into his
ear a story that made the usually
smiling boniface angrily gnaw his low
er lip.
When the driver reached the railroad
depot he found several other hackraen
there on a similar mission. Their sto
ries tallied with that of the man from
the Occidental. Certainly there was a
possibility that several brides might be
coming from the south. Building their
faith on that prospect the jehus had
patiently awaited the arrival of the
train. But no brides came, and the
drivers returned with their vehicles to
their respective hotels.
Later in the day there was a lively :
conference between several hotel man
agers over the phone, and they learned
that they had all been fooled by a
stranger. The same individual had gone
to the Grand Hotel, where he repre
sented himself as Henry Allen of Mar
tinez and mr.de elaborate arrangements
tor his approaching marriage. As Wil
iam Allen he had engaged rooms, flow
?rs and hacks at the Russ House, and
iiad later played a similar trick upon
[he unsuspecting clerk at the Lick. The
California Hotel also fell happily into
the matrimonial scheme of the stranger
and was able to boast last night of
tiaving as many wilted flowers on hand
is the Occidental, Grand, Lick or Russ.
The disappointed hotel managers
agreed that they were the dupes of
some fellow whose mind is deranged
m the subject of matrimony.

FRUIT CAHNERS FORM LEAGUE
FOR GOOD OF INDUSTRY. .
First Board of Directors Is Erected
PRESIDENT. FIRST VICE PRESIDENT AND CHAIRMAN OF THE EXECUTIVE
COMMITTEE Of THE CANKERS' LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA, WHO WERE
ELECTED YESTERDAY WHEN AN ORGANIZATION WAS PERFECTED.
The fruit and vegetable canners of
California formed an organization yes
terday afternoon and the Canners'
League of California is in existence.
After the preliminary meeting of
Thursday, the special committee ap
pointed to prepare a plan and by-laws
took the plan that is in vogue in New
York State and adopted it in all its
essential provisions.
No power was conferred upon the
executive board of the new body to fix
prices or in any way to interfere with
the Individual management of any
canning concern. It is provided that
the league shall foster the interest of
the canned goods industry of Cali
fornia ; that it shall stand against un
just exactions; shall reform abuses in
trade, and promote more friendly in
tercourse among packers, look after
legislation and generally act in its col
lective capacity for the benefit of the
entire fruit and vegetable canning in
dustry of California.
The report of the plan was submit
ted to the canners yesterday afternoon
in. the moras of the Chamber of Com
merce by Major C. L Tilden, who
made some explanatory remarks. . He
said the committee had first considered
what good could be derived 'hy the can
ners from organization, and also how
far the organization might extend its
agency. The general conclusion was
that the first thing to do*was to come
together. The plan that the committee
had prepared gave every man engaged
in the business the same rights as
members of the league. To each con
cern or individual engaged In canning
wag given but one vote.
The organization plan included" the
election of a president, two vice presi
dents, a secretary, treasurer and an
executive committee of five members
to act as a board of directors. This
committee was authorized, when it was
not feasible to call a meeting of the
league, to take a vote on any question
of pressing importance and to act in
accordance with the wishes of the ma
jority of the league.
Among'the provisions was one mak
ing all the original members and those

and for the concerns that they repre
sented the meeting adjourned.

CITY OFFICIALS
TO BE SHIFTED
Flans Are Making to Trans
fer Supervisor Finn and
Members of Two Boards
â ' â¦
BETTER JOB FOR BOYNE
Mayor Wants Election Com
missioner Devoto to Cham
pion Him and His Cause
Preparations are now under way that
j involve the shifting of one member
iof the Board of Supervisors and the
exchange of the offices of two munici
pal commissioners, besides the removal
of several subordinates and the ap
| pointment of their successors. Just
when the "shift" will be made is not
I known, as it has been temporarily
' postponed until the consent of the in
| terested parties can be obtained,
j The deal as contemplated includes
the transfer of Supervisor Thomas F.
Finn either to the Fire or Election
Commission, but more likely to the
] former body. Finn, who is ill at his
home, has been approached on the sub
j jest and he has signified his willingness
j to make the change.
Should Finn be made a Fire Com
missioner it is said that J. George
Boyne will resign from the board in
order to receive the appointment
to the office of Registrar of Elections
now held by George P. Adams, who Is
slated for removal some time next
month.
The object of transferring Finn to a â 
commissionership is to enable Mayor
Schmitz to appoint a man to the Board
of Supervisors who will be able fo take
up the cudgels in his behalf when he \
or his administration is attacked by
the McNab faction and to act as his I
champion on whatever stand he may
choose to take on municipal measures, j
The man whom the Mayor thinks es- i
pecially fit for the place in that re- !
spect is James A. Devoto, Election ;
Commissioner. Devoto is an attorney
and is believed to be competent to rise I
to the Mayor's defense when occasion |
requires it. He has the matter under
consideration and it only needs his
acquiescence to carry out the plans as t
described. In that event a vacancy
would be created on the Election Com- j
mission to which Boyne could be ap- |
pointed, should he decline the Regis
tranship. The latter position pays $200
a month and in accepting it Boyne .
would receive double his present salary
as Fire Commissioner. In fact, the :
salary question is the main difficulty ,
in making the shift, aside from the
political sacrifices involved. The sal
ary of a Supervisor is $1200 per year, |
while that of an Election commissioner j
is "only $ltÂ»00. The difference might j
cause some to hesitate about consent- >
ing to the change.
Coincident with the appointment of |
a successor to Registrar Adams, a
shakeup will occur in the Registrar's
office. It is said that Danny Gordon,
now a deputy in the inner office, will j
take Harry Zemansky's place as chief
deputy and Deputy H. B. Moynihan ;
will get Gordon's place. Zemansky will |
probably be made a deputy at his orl- j
ginal salary of $100 per month.
Other changes include the transfer |
of James de sSucca. secretary of the |
Park Commission, to be storekeeper :
of the Board of Education and the re- j
turn of former Commissioner of Works
Herbert Schmitz to his old place,, now
held by De Succa. Other appointments
to be made include the secretaryship of
the Police Commission, for which Bar-*
ney Flood is being prominently men
tioned, and the secretaryship of the
Board of Works, which Morris Levy
will relinquish. No announcement of
Levy's probable successor has been
mad?, unless the "shift" contemplates
the appointment to the position of one
of the men whose names have been
mentioned above.
The Mayor confirmed the statement
printed in yesterday's Call that Dr.
Frank J. Tillmann will not be appointed
to the vacancy on the Health Board
to succeed Pohelm. His Honor said
that the place had been offered to
Tillmann, who had refused to accept the
appointment. The Mayor added that
he was not ready to announce the ap
pointment, but will do so In a few
days, at the same time naming the
new Park Commissioner, who will, in
all likelihood, be William H. Metson.

SUES POLICEMAN FOR
FALSE IMPRISONMENT
\\. W. Ackerson Seeks Damages for
His Arrest by Patrolman Dwyer
on Christmas Day.
W. W. Ackerson yesterday brought
suit against Policeman J. M. Dwyer to
recover $299 damages for arresting
him without a warrant at 141 Larkln
street last Christmas day and march
ing him a prisoner to the City Hall ;
station, where he was confined in a ,
cell with persons accused of crime. |
The trouble arose over Ackerson's at- ;
tempting to restrain Dwyer from ar- ,
resting Harry Quig on a charge of bat
tery. Dwyer filed a complaint against j
Ackerson for interference with an of
ficer, but the charge was dismissed in
tht Police Court. Ackerson claims to
have been damaged in the sum of
$5000, but waives all damages in ex
cess of $299, so as to bring suit in the i
Justice's Court.

ARTHUR PIPER
NOW IN JAIL
Spends Day in Custody and
Court Refuses Release on
Writ of Habeas Corpus
SLOSS' ORDER STANDS
Shipping Man Must Stay in
Prison Until He Pays the
Back Alimony Due Wife
In accordance with Judge Sloss' or
der of Thursday Arthur Leroy Piper
of the shipping firm of Piper, Aden,
Goodall & Co. was taken into custody
at his home, 2SJ2I Jackson street, by
Deputy Sheriff McManus and escorted
to the County Jail. His arrest resulted
from disobedience of the court's or
der for him to pay $<525 back alimony
to his wife, Mary Ellen Piper. He took
his incarceration lightly and based his
expectation for a quick release upon
habeas corpus proceedings promised
by his attorneys, but In this he was
doomed to disappointment.
The application for the writ was pre
pared and presented to Presiding Judge
Lawlor, who, on account of hearing the
arguments in the Wyman case, had not
the time to give the matter his atten
tion. Attorney Lande began a search
for some Superior Judge with time to
spart, and was disappointed in suc
cession by Judges Cook, Dunne, Gra
ham and Murasky. A few min
utes before 5 o'clock the matter was
brought to Judge Troutt. Mr. Piper
accompanied his attorney. Arthur H.
Liarendt, representing the wife, was on
hand to offer opposition. Mr. Lande
read Judge Sloss' commitment to Judge
Troutt and expressed his opinion that
It was worthless because there waa no
2xpress finding of the, court that Piper
was able to pay the money; second,
that there was nothing to show that
the order to show cause, which was
first heard on Sepetmber 30 last, had
t)een continued in force, and, third, that
the commitment was fatally defective
n committing a man to jail "until an
jrder is complied with," because it is
practically a perpetual Imprisonment
'or the non-payment of money, which
s against the law.
Judge Troutt quickly disposed of the i
natter by declaring that Judge Sloss j
loubtless knew what he was doing I
,vhen he signed the commitment, and I
ie (Judge Troutt) did not care to In- I
erfere with the order of a brother i
rudge. Therefore the writ was denied 1
md Piper was remanded to the custody
)f the Sheriff. He was taken back to
:he County Jail.
Judge Hebbard yesterday denied the
notion for alimony in the case of An
ile- M. Davidson, who is suing James
j. Davidson for divorce. The husband
nade "a showing that he had deeded
property to his wife and children and
lad spent his own money In improv
ng it. .
The afternoon yesterday in Judge
L'routt's court was devoted to a hear- I
ng of the motion of William A. Mat- '
hews for a modification of his
vife's divorce decree, by which she was
iwarded the custody of their tvfp chil-
Iren. His attorney is Samuel M.
