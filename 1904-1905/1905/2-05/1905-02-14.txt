Insulted.

CALL BUREAU. POST BUILDING.
Washington, Feb. 13.â There Â« is
disposition on the part, of many Sena
tors to consider the announcement
made to-day by President Roosevelt,
through Secretary Kay. relative to the
general arbitration treaties, as a per
sonal insult to each Senator who voted
to amend these conventions. In reply
to numerous Inquiries by representa
tives of the press at the State Depart
ment to-day. Secretary Hay made, in
eubstance, the following statement:
"The President regards the matter of
the general arbitration treaties as con
cluded by the action of the Senate on
Saturday. He recognizes the right of
the Senate to reject a treaty either by
a direct vote in that sense, or indi
rectly by changes which are incompat
ible with its spirit and purpose. He
considers that with the Senate amend
ment the treaties not only cease to be
a step forward in the cause of general
arbitration, but are really a step back
ward, and therefore he is unable to
prer exit them in this altered form to
ihe countries with which we have been
in negotiations."
SENATE GNASHING ITS TEETH.
It is held that the President means
that each of the fifty. Senators who
-Â»v*tit oa -record was toÂ© cowardiyTto
assist in defeating the treaties by a
vote against ratification and took the
underhand method of rejecting: them
by amendment. The President's an
nouncement through Hay has materi
ally widened the breach with the Sen
ate. The feature of the President's
statement which has aroused the anger
of the Senate is that he "recognizes
the right of the Senate to reject a
treaty either by a direct vote in that
sense. or indirectly by changes which
are incompatible with its spirit and
purpose."
Fifty Senators who voted to amend
d eight v ho favored the
â¢served their pairs, are
ed in this accusation of bad faith
erÂ»d utilization of a techniealitv to re
3e^t the treaties instead of following the
straightforward course of definite rejec

angxr is a phased some of them will

The irritation of the Senate to-day
Increased the disposition to learn ail
possible facts about the Santo Domingo
agreements. There Is a possibility that
the treaty negotiated with that repub
lic will receive rough treatment when
It finally reaches the Senate. The sen
timent yesterday was to divorce arbi
tration treaties from all other ques
tions and permit any subsequent con
ventions to stand or fall on their mer
its. There is a feeling . now in some
quarters that a brick should be thrown
at the President whenever he appeals
to the Senate for any reason whatever.
Tho arbitration treaties were received
at the White Rouse to-day. Following
the usual procedure, they will be re
corded and forwarded to "the State De
partment. Then they will bi sent to
the librarian, where, in accordance
â with the statement issued by Secretary
Hay, they will remain.
Senator Cullom, chairman of the
Committee on Foreign Relations, after
reading Secretary Hay's comment on
the actwn of the Senate in amending
the arbitration treaties, said to-day:
"The Senate's position is right, ab
solutely. If anything is done hereafter
the President will have to take the Sen
ate into his confidence. It might re
quire a little more time, hut otherwise
I can see nothing in the Senate's course
inharmonious with the President's in
terpretation of his treaty-making:

LOS ANGELES. Feb. After a
chase which covered nine-tenths ; l; of
the circumference of the earth , and
during which he was closely hounded
by persons representing those whom he
is alleged to have 'victimized, Owen
Kelly, a once prosperous mer
chant, wanted in Philadelphia - fur the
embezzlement erf more than $50,000, was
arrested to-night by Chief Hammel and
Captain of Detectives Bradish. He ad
mitted his identity, admitted he was
wanted in Philadelphia and that he
was short in his accounts there. .He
stated also that he was tired of being
a fugitive and was glad that the end
had come. He has a desire to go back
to Pennsylvania without a requisition,
but, for fear that he will change his
mind, the Pennsylvania officer who
will start West for him to-morrow, will
â¢come by way of Sacramento and. have
his requisition honored by Governor
, Pa idee.
Kelly says he doesn't know the exact
amount of his - shortage. . He cannot
j tell whether ;itj is $50,000 or more, but
think.<? -ii Is * somewhere -=: near i, ; that
; amount. He lost it speculating in steel

, was certain and . now that* he is in jail
he admits; that he has " not the f means
to make good the money of other per
sons which he used in his efforts to
win a fortune.
EMBEZZLES $50,000.
Advices to-night from Philadelphia
indicate that. $50,000 will cover the
amount . of his alleged peculations.
From one cousin he secured $20,000,
from another person he secured as
much more and from the funds of the
mental Trust Company he used
a-bout $25,000. Some of this was made
I good after his disappearance, but the
j prisoner has not the slightest idea of
the condition of his finances.
Kelly was a wholesale grocer in
Philadelphia. From an humble begin
ning he prospered and after years of
business had amassed a fortune. He
was half , owner of one : the largest
houses in that city and was director
in several industrial corporations, in
cluding the Continental Trust Com
pany. On the evening of October 24
last he attended a meeting of" the di-
I rectors of that company and then dis
appeared- 1 The fact that he was miss
ing was sent broadcast over the coun
try and his relatives offered a reward
for information as to his where
abouts.
Until two days ago there was no sus
picion that he was wanted on a crim
inal charge. / Then ' came a telegram
from the Philadelphia Police Depart
ment asking th; ' Kelly be arrested on
sight and that he be held until he
could be sent for. Meantime his cousin
had presented a claim for $22,000,
money which he had given Kelly for a
specific purpose, to which it had not
b^on applied. Then came another claim
for a greater amount and then the Con
tinental' Trust Compa^v admitted the
los? of many thousands of dollars
through him.
TRACED THROUGH EUROPE. ;
A search was instituted for Kelly by
the trust company. .It was learned
that he had sailed, from Boston, but to
what port was [ not known. He . was
followed across the Atlantic, chased
across Europe and finally lost entirely.
Where he went was ' not known until
last night,: when after his arrest he de
tailed his movements. ... . " .
' After leaving â¢ Boston in a tramp ;
! steamer bound . for .. a ; Mediterranean
I port, he went through the | Red Sea to
India and thence to Australia.. The
climate there did not agree with" him
and he decided to return to the United ,
States, thinking he could hide his iden- |
tity on the Pacific Coast and be safe ;
from arrest. He arrived, in; San Fran
cisco nearly four weeks ago and spent
three weeks there, coming to ! Los An
geles a week ago.taking up his abode
I in a cheap rooming-house on *~ South
I Main street. â  " : ,
It is certain that he did not com
municate with any of his relatives, al
though it is probable that he did com
municate with some persons in Phil
adelphia. Whether it was this that
resulted in his capture is not known.
in fact, his presence here would not
have been known at all to the author
ities but for a "flier" which somebody
in Philadelphia took and as a result
of which some Philadelphia newspa
per published a statement to the ef
fect that Kelly was in I^os Angeles.
From the description telegraphed
last night from Philadelphia the of
ficers picked him up on the street to
niglit. On his person they found $500
and he admitted that he had $5000 or
more when he left home.
'There Is no hope for me," he said
"I'll go back an] take my medicine!
It was all done through an effort to
get a million out of steel securities."

PRESIDENT HANDLES RACE ISSUE
AT LINCOLN DINNER IN NEW YORK
ASKS NORTH 70 GIVE HELP TO SOUTH
WHITES MUST
RENDER AID
TO NEGROES
Leaders in Dixie
Receive Praise
for Work.
NEW YORK, Feb. 13.â As the guest
of honor at the Lincoln dinner of the
Republican Club in this city to-night,
President Roosevelt made a speech on
the race problem. He appealed tb the
North to make its friendship to the
South all the greater because of "the
embarrassment of ' conditions from
which she is not alone responsible." He
declared that the heartiest acknowl
edgments are due to the ministers, of
ficers of the law, grand jurors, public
men and "great daily newspapers in
the South who have recently done such
effective work in leading the crusade
against lynching." He said that the
problem was to "so adjust the relations
between the two races of different eth
nic types that the backward race be
trained so that It may enter into the
possession of true freedom, while the
forward race is enabled to preserve un
harmed the high civilization wrfught
out by its forefathers."
Following the President, Senator Dol
liver of lowa responded to the toast
"Abraham Lincoln," George A. Knight
of California spoke on "The Republican
Party" and James M. Beck, former As
sistant Attorney General of the United
States, on "Unity of the Republic."
ENTHUSIASTIC WELCOME.
President Roosevelt received an en
thusiastic welcome at Jersey City on
the arrival of his special train from
v/fiphington this afternoon. A crowd
that had waited in the ferry-house for
half an hour Joined In cheering while
the President and his party were es
corted through the station to the ferry
boat, which carried him to West Twen
ty-third street.
The trip from Washington was
marked by no incidents of interest.
Only one stop was made, at Philadel
phia, and the President remained quiet
ly in his car throughout the journey.
At Twenty-third street a large crowd
was waiting and loudly cheered as the
President left the ferry building and
entered his carriage. With the Presi
dent were Police Commissioner Mc-
Adoo, William D. Murphy, chairman of
the reception committee of the Repub
lican Club, and Secretary Loeb. The
rest of the Presidential party, consist
ing of Mrs. Roosevf It, Secretary and
Mrs. Taft, Mrs. Cowles, Mr. and Mrs.
Kmlin Roosevelt and Charles F. Stokes,
U. S. N.. entered other carriages. Fol
lowed by two carriages containing se
cret service men and Central office de
tectives and surrounded by a troop of
mounted police, the President was
driven rapidly across town 'to Fifth
avenue and at once to the Republican
Club. The route was crowded with per
sons anxious to catch a glimpse of the
President, and he was cheered all along
the lino.
HEAVY POLICE GUARD.
Both at Jersey City and on the New
York side, the police precautions were
on a somewhat more extensive scale
than at any previous visit of the Presi
dent to this city. At the railway sta
tion in Jersey City there were several

KIND WORDS FOR THE SOUTH.
THE great Civil War left us not only a reunited country, but a
couniry which has the proud right to claim as its own the
glory won alike by those who wore the blue and by those who
wore the gray, by those who followed Grant and by those who
followed Lee, for both fought with equal bravery and with equal
sincerity of conviction, each striving for the light as it was given
him to See the lightâ From speech of President Roosevelt.
uniformed police and plain clothes men
and on this side, in addition to the
mounted squad. Commissioner Mc-
Adoo had ordered out many policemen
and detectives. Four inspectors also
were at the ferry and accompanied the"
Presidential party across the city.
The President arrived at the club at
4 o'clock and was escorted to the large
reception-room on the second floor,
where he took his stand in front of a
canopy of American flags. Near him
were Louis Stein, president of the club,
and other prominent personages. The
reception lasted two hours, during
which time nearly 900 persons greeted
the President.
At the close of the reception the Pres
ident drove, accompanied by the same
escort, to the home of his sister, Mrs.
Douglas Robinson, in Madison avenue.
Here, after a brief rest, the President
dressed for dinner and was driven to
the Waldorf-Astoria, where he arrived
at 7:30 o'clock and again became the
guest of the Republican Club.
ELABORATE DECORATIONS.
The dinner was held in the main ban
quet hall of the Waldorf-Astoria and,
in the number of pruests and elaborate
scale of the det -rations, is believed to
have excelled any function of its char
acter ever held in New York. The
guests numbered more than thirteen
hundred and not only crowded the
main banquet hall, but the Astoria gal
iery, the myrtle room and even the
foyer on the second floor, the whole of
which was used. Among the guests
were 275 women who dined in thÂ» As
tor gallery.
In the main banquet hall the gal
leries v.ere almost entirely hidden by
decorations and the tables were laden
with roses. Or. the walls were festoons
of American flags and the coats of
arms of the States. Back of the
speakers' table was a large oil paint
ing of Lincoln, draped with American
flags and surmounted in electric lights
with the famous motto: '"With malice
toward none; with charity for all."
Among those who sat at the Presi
dent's table were: Secretary of War
Taft, Elihu Root, Whitelaw Reid, B.
B. Odell. Senator Dolliver. John H.
Finley, president Q.f the College of the
City of New York: Oscar Straus,

The President was introduced by
Louis Stein, president of the Republi
can Club, In a brief speech. As Presi
dent Roosevelt rose, the banqueters in
the adjoining rooms crowded into the
main hall and gallery. The President
said:
In his second inaugural, in a speech which
will be read as long as the memory of this
nation endujes, Abraham I-lnccln closed by
saying:
"With malic* toward none; with charity for
all; with firmness In the right, as God tfvw
us to see the right, let ua strive on to finish
the work wÂ« are in â¢ â¢ â¢ to* do all which
may achieve anÂ»l cherish a Ju3t and lasting
peace among ourselves, and with all nations."
Immediately after his re-election he had al
ready spoken thus:
â¢The strife of the election is but human
nature practically applied to the facts of the
case. What has occurred in this case must
ever recur in similar cases. Human naturr
will not ihanjte. In any future (treat national
trial, compared with the men of this, we shall
have as weak and as strong, as silly and .as
wise, as bad and as good. Let us, therefore.

effort, to servo our coromen country? -For my
own part, I â¢ have striven and shall strive .to
avoid j plaoinr any . obstacle in - the way. *.* So
lons as I have been hero I have not willingly
planted a thorn in any man's bosom. While I
am deeply sensible to the high, compliment of
a re-election. â¢ and . duly - grateful, as . I trust, to
Almighty God for having: directed my country
men to a ri*ht conclusion, as [ think, for their
own good, it adds nothing to .my satisfaction

i "May : I : ask . those, who have ; not differed
with -me' to Join with m<Â» in this 'same spirit
toward " those : who < have?" ' â 
â â¢This .is the. spirit in â  which â  mighty Lincoln
sought to bind up the ration's wounds when
its soul was yet seething with fierce hatreds,
with wrath, -with rancor, with ail the evil Â»n<i
dreadful passions provoked by - ctvil - war
Surely this* is the spirit which all Americans
should show now, when there is so little ex
cuse . for : malice or rancor or hatred, when
there is so little of vital consequence to di
vide brother from brother.
LINCOLN AS A MOI>KI..
â * Lincoln, him.self a.mm ,of Southern birth,
did not hesitate to appeal to the sword when
he became satisfied that in .no other way could
the Union ; be saved, lor high though he put
peace, he put righteousness still - higher, tlla
warred lor the Union; he warred u> free thÂ»
slave: and : when he warred he warred in
earnest, for it is a sign of weakness to be
half-hearted when blows must be struck. But
he felt only love, a love, as deep as the ten
derness of his great and sad heart, for all his
countrymen alike In the North > and in the
South, and he longed above everything for the
day when they : should once more be knit .to
gether 'in the unbreakable " bonds of . eternal
friendship. : â â¢mNMBfIajMI MBBpftgnnpKHÃM
* We of to-day, in dealing 1 with ail our fellow
citizens, white or colored. North or South,
should i strive to ; show .'Just the qualities that
Lincoln showed ; his steadfastness in 'striving
after the right, and his infinite patience and
forbearance, with those who . saw that right
less clearly . than ' he did: his earnest' endeavor
to do what was best." and yet his readiness to
accept the best that .was practicable when the
ideal best was .unattainable: his unceasing ef
fort -to cure what was evil, coupled with his
refusal to make a. bad situation worse by. any
111-judged or ill-timed effort to make It better.
The great Civil War. In which Lincoln tow
ered as the loftiest figure, left us not only a
reunited country. .but a country which has the
proud ' right ' to claim as â , Its own the â¢ glory
won alike by. those who wore the blue and by
those who wore â  the : gray, by those who fol
lowed : Grant and by those who follow- i !*â¢Â».
for both fought with equal bravery and .with
equal sincerity of conviction, each strrvinÃ for

of. the. cause of freedom and of the Union wan
essential to the welfare of mankind. We arÂ»

North must, ' because they are good American*,

JUSTICE FOR THE NEGRO.
Neither I nor any other , man <an say that
any given way .of approaching that problem
will prenerJ in our time even an approximately
perfect notation, hut we can safely say that
there chti never r* such solution at all unless
â¢**â  aprroac.i it. with the ctrort to do fair and
equal juf-tice arncng ail mon:- and to demand
from than in return just and fair treatment
for others. Our effort rhould be- to secure to
each man. whatever his color, equality of op
portunity, (-yaality of treatment be/ore the
law. At- Â« people â  'ing to shape our 'gc
tioria in accordance with the great law cf
righteousnefes uc ccr.not afford to take part in
or be indifferent to â¢ v â¢ oppression or maltreat
ment of any man who, against crushing dis
advantages, hue by his i â â ..:.â .. energy,
If -reaped and perseverance struggled upward
to a position wmch would entitle him to the
ieFi>eot of h:s feilowe, if only his akin were a
different hue.
Every generous impulse in us revolts at the
thought of thrusting down instead of helping
up such a man. To deny any man the fair
.treatment granted to others no better than he
!Â» to commit a wrong upon him â a wrong run"
to react in the long run upon those guilty of
roch denial. The only safe principle upon
*hioh Americans can act is that of "all men
pv." net that of "some men down." If in any
community the level of intelligence, morality
and thrift among the colored men can be
raiso-l, it is, !:uir.anly Kodaking, mire that the
t-hmr level nmonÃ the whites will be raised
to an even higher dÂ«giÂ«c; and it is no less
*ure that the debasement of the blacks will
in the >!nd carry with it an attendant debase
ment of the whites.
The problem Is so to adjust the relations be
tnoi two races of different ethnic type that
xhp rights oi neither be abridged nor jeoparded:
tint the backward race be trained bo that it

while the : â â â¢..â  race is enabled to preserve
unharmed the high civilization wrought out
by its forefather. The working oat of this

morality.
BURDEN" ON* WHITE MAN.
Nor is It only necessary to train the colored
mar; it Is quite as necessary to train the
white nun, for on his shoulders rests a well
Jitph unparalleled sociological responsibility. It
is a probjem demanding the best thought, *!.'"
inmost patience, the most earnest effort, the
broadest charity of the statesman, the stu
dent, tho philanthropist; of the leaders of
thought in every department of our national
life. The church cj.n be a most important fac
tor in solving it aright. But. above all else,

duty by th- average plain citizen in his every

devotion to it, but also wisdom and self-re
straint in the exhibition of that devotion; we
t-!;:.;! defer the time for its realization still
'urlher. In striving to attain to so much of
It it- concerns dealing with men of different
colors, we must remember two things.
In the first place, it is true of th" colored
mam, se it is true of the white man. that in
tho long run his fate must depend far more
upon his own effort than upon the efforts of
any outside friend. Every vicious, venal, or
iKin.ra tit colored man is an even greater foe
to his (iwn race than to the community as a
whole. The colored man's self-respect entitle?
him to do that share in the political work of
the country which is warranted by his In
dividual ability and integrity and the position

DUTY FALLS UPON' ALL.
I^aziness and fihiftlessness. these, and above
all. vict and criminality of every kind, are
evils more potent for harm to the black race
thai, all acts 'â¢ oppression of white men put
together. Tfce colored man who falls to con
demn crime in another colored man. who
fails to co-operate in all lawful ways in bring
ing rclcred criminals to Justice, is the worst
enemy of his own people, as well as an enemy
to all the people. Law-abiding black men
*houl<J, for the sake of their race, be foremost
In relentless end unceasing wartime against
law-breaking black men. If the standards of
private morality and industrial efficiency can
he raised high enough among the black race,
then its future on this continnet is secure. The
stability and purity of the home is vital to
the welfare of the black race as It is to the
v.f-Ifare of every race.
In the next place the white man. who, If
only he is willing, can help the colored man
more than all other white men put together.
Is the whit* man who is his neighbor. North
or South. Each of us must do his whole duty
without flinching, and if that duty Is national
it 'must be done in accordance with the prin

cacfl to be )is brother* a keeper it is wise to
remember that each can normally do most
for the brother ho is his immediate neighbor.
If we are sincere friends of the negro let us

therein, and let us each show it also by up
holding the hands of the white man. in what
ever locality, who is striving to do Justice
to the poor and the helpless, to be a shield
to those whose need for such a shield is

GOOD WORK IX DIXIELAND.
Tne heartiest acknowledgments are due to
thÂ« ministers, the Judges and law officers, the
grand juries, the public men and the great
daily newspaper* in the South, who have re
cently dine such effective work in leading the.
crusad-e against lynching in the South; and
I am glad to say that during the last three
months the returns, as far as they can be
gathered, show a smaller number of lynchingg
thai, for any two months during the
last twenty years. I>Â»t us uphold in every
way tV hands of the men who have led in
tliis work, who arc striving to do all their
work in this spirit. I am about to quote from
the address of -the Right Her. Robert
t-trange. Bishop Coadjutor of. North Carolina,
Â«s riven in the Southern Churchman of Oc
tober S. 15*04.
The Biffcop first enter* an emphatic plea,
ncainrt any social Intermingling of the races;
a (rjumion which must, or course, be left to
the p-Hirlr- of ouch community to settle for
themselves, as In such a matter no one com
mmif:- â and indeed no one Individual â can
dletat* to Â«ny other; always provided that in
'â¢a.-h locality men keep in mind the fact that
th*re must be tin confusing of civil privileges
â with social Intercourse. Civil law cannot
regulate social practices Society, as such, is
â¢ it* unto itself, and will always regulate Its I
xiTin rractices and habits. Pull recognition of i
th* fundamental fact that all men should !
stand on an equal footing, as regards civil :
privilege*, in no way interferes with recogni
tion of the further fact that all reflecting men
of both races are united In feeling that race, !
nurity must be maintained. The Bishop con- i
tinue*:
"â¢What should the white men of the South
rdo for the negro? They must give him a free
.hand, a fair field and a cordial godspeed, the
two race* working together for their mutual
benefit and for the development of our com
mon country He must have liberty, equal
opportunity to make his living, to earn his
bread, to build his home. He must have Jus
tice, equal rishta and protection before the
law. He raun have the same political priv- ;
ileges: the suffrage should be. based on char
*'"' and intelligence for white and black
alike. He must have the same public ad
vantages of education; the public schools are
for all liâ people, whatever their color cr
condition.
â¢â¢The white men of the South should 'give
hearty and respectful consideration to the ex
ceptional men of the negro race to those who
have the character, the ability and the desire
to be lawyers, physicians teachers, preachers,
leaders of thought and conduct among their i
own I m and women. We should give them
cheer and opportunity to gratify every laud
rble ambition and to seek every Innocent sat
â¢ efaction among their own people. Finally, the
best white men of the South should have fre
quent conferences with the best colored men,
where. In frank, earnest and sympathetic dis
cussion they might understand each other bet
ter, smooth difficulties and so guide and en
courage thÂ« weaker race."
TO UPBUILD THE UNION*;
Surely we can all of us join in expressing !
our substantial agreement with the principles i
thus laja down by thin North Carolina Bishop, '

the South. . â¢ ' .". i

REGARD FOR THE SOUTH.
I believe in this country with all my heart

the end ripe level to every need, will in the
end triumph over every difficulty that rises
l<efore then:. I could not have such confident
faith in the destiny of this mighty people if

people. Throughout our land things on the
whole have frown better and not worse, and
this is Â»â¢. true of_"ne part of the country as

For weal or for woe we are knit together
and we shall go up or bo down together; and
I believe that we shall so up and not down,
that we shall go forward Instead of halting
and falling back, because I have an abiding
faith in the generosity, the courage, the resolu

The Southern States face difficult problems,
and so do the Northern States. Some of the
problems are the same for the entire country.
Others exist in greater intensity In one sec

JOKED BY DOLIJVER.
The. President received an ovation at
the end of his speech and many times
during his address he was forced to
pause until the diners had made mani
fest their approval of his utterances.
When the applause had subsided. Sen
ator Dolliver was introduced. The
President, who had an engagement to
address the Press Club, waited to hear
the lowa speaker.'
In the ctrurse of his speech, Senator
Dolliver made reference to the Senate's
vote on Saturday last on President
Roosevelt's â¢ treaty proposition which
brought the diners to their feet and
caused the President to smile. The
Senator said:
"Abraham Lincoln had a treaty of
peace which was never sent to the Sen
ate. It made him the ally of the Lord
of Host*."
The President remained until Sena
tor Dolliver had concluded, when he
left the banquet chamber.
KNIGHT SPEAKS FOR coast.
George A. Knight of California closed
the speaking. Knight said in part:
It needed no prophetic mind to know that
the work of the Republican party was to main
lain the Union, preserve the dignity of its
labor. establish a national credit, equip and
maintain an army for civil war, the most stu
pendous in the annalp of time. It took cour
age, â¢ steadfastness of purpose and patriotism
to face the awful peril of the hour, but the
Republican party never faltered.
If no Republican party had been at Lincoln's
Bide a dissolution of this Union would have
been a fact after the first shot at our flag at
Bumter. Had there been no Democratic or
ganization in the North the war of the re
bellion would not have lasted twenty- minutes.
I may be inexact as to time, but you get my
Idea. . .- rJ . . .-
The ' statesmanship of our Republican lead
ers is more than magnified by the conditions
confronting us on the Pacific Coast to-day.
The political sagacity of Seward in the pur
chase of Alaska marked another era In our
acquisition of territory necessary for our na
tional progress and prosperity, and had it not
been for the "scuttle policy", that crept into a
national policy, at too early a â when the
importance of the Pacific Coast was scarcely
Known and clearly misunderstood â we'd have
had an unbroken seacoast line from the Gulf
of California to Bering Sea and no alien flag
sailing irom a foreign pert competing with our
commerce could aid in driving the American
flag from the high seas.
Much has bern said about the trade with
the Orient, but very few of us have any definite
conception of the immensity of the business
that may be opened up to American merchants
and manufacturers in that region.
With Asia and Oceanica together, the popu
lation aggregates 850,000,0u0 in an area of
18,000.000 square miles. The trade of these
countries is already immense. In this estimate
no allowance is mode for the Pacific Coast of
the continents of North and South America,
whose trade will bring the entire commerce
of the Pacific to more than $2, Â£00,000, 000 a
year.
Come to California, and see an emerald pet
round with the diamond snows of the Sierras
and the rurf of the â an empire in herself,
that bids you and yours godspeed and wel
come. She Is Republican from principle and
believes in the policies of that party, and did
believe in them at a time when It was vital
to the life of this very nation that she should
be loyal to the flag of the Union. She has
golden fruits, of mine and tree, and every re
source within her own demain that made this
nation great. We now invite you of the Em
pire State, representing the wealth, some of
the Intelligence and more of our trade, to look
west of the Missouri River and see the op
portunities that beckon you. to. help along the

Come: to San Francisco, the keeper of the

SPEAKS AT PRESS DINNER
President Advises Courtesy in Talk-
ing of Foreign Nations.
NEW YORK. Feb. 13. â At the thir
ty-second annual dinner of the New
York Press Club at the Hotel Astor
President Roosevelt was the guest of
honor. Six hundred or more men
gathered about the tables in the main
ballroom, while the balconies were
filled with ladies. George H. Rowe
presided. To his right sat President
Roosevelt and on his left the German
Embassador, Speck yon Sternberg.
Xext to President Roosevelt was Mgr.
Falconi, papal delegate to the United
States.
The German Embassador, in his
address, said that during his recent
visit to Germany he was struck by
the rapidly growing interest which
the Gorman people are showing in
the affairs of the United States. This
interest, which in former years was
only confined to certain quarters, has
now become universal.
President* Roosevelt arrived at the
Hotel Astor shortly Rfter midnight
and a few minutes later he was in
troduced. His entrance to the ban
quet room was the signal for an out
burst of enthusiasm, followed by a
second demonstration when he was
introduced. An informal reception
followed his speech. President
Uoofevelt said in part:
I am glad to see that you have our good
friend the German ; Emhassador here to-night.
I am *lad that you Invited the representatives
of the various foreign , countries, and I want
to say just Â» word about the general attitude
of our people In their foreign policy and what
it should be. ;â  Fundamentally it ought to be
based on just about. the principle that ought
to govern i each private individual citizen In
his dealings with his fellows.. We should try

courteously and insultingly floes them do harm;
it may Irritate them, and therefore It may
do us some harm.
You remember that Abraham Lincoln said
there is a deal of . human nature In mankind.
Now, other nations are very human, also, and
come of their public men or the public news
papers' will occasionally speak, unpleasantly
of us. In-such cases ii does 'no- earthly Rood
to answer back. Not the least. Apply It' in
private life again. If one man says wme
thinK to another, the stronger the. other man
the lees he finds It necessary to answer back.
He docs not want to talk at all until he has
to act, and then he wants to act with de
cision. The most contemptible ot. all atti
tudes is to talk loudly and then act with In
decision. Now just so with nations. â â¢ Do not
speak ill of other nations. -If they speak ill
of us, keep on not speaking ill of them. In
the first place, it will Irritate them more than
anything else would to pay. no heed to their
comment. In the next place it won't help if
they have made errora for us to make er
rors, too. .
In presenting figures showing a de.-
CTefUM In lynehings in the last three
months the President said: "These are
striking figures and I take a certain
satisfaction in them in view of some
of the gloomy forebodings of last
summer."
Ag the President left the Hotel As
tor there was a slight delay in the
arrival of the carriages. Turning to
the mounted policemen who were act
ing as his escort, he thanked them
and added: "You look a great deal
better than you did In my day."
President Roosevelt left the Hotel
A.Â«tor and entered his carriage with
Secretary Loeb. His escort of twelve
mounted poliremen surrounded the
carriage, which was driven rapidly to
Madison avenue and thence to the
house of Douglass Robinson, where
Roosevelt spent the night. In accord
ance with their usual custom the
secret service men exercised surveil
lance of the house throughout the
night. It is said there were members
of the detective force within close
call.
FEDERAL JURY
TAKES A REST
Adjourns After Returning
More Indictments Against
Mitchell and Many Others
PORTLAND, Ore., Feb. 13.â The
Federal Grand Jury, from which so
many of the prominent men of the
State have received unenviable notice,
has separated until the word of Dis
trict Attorney Heney shall call the
members together again on April 1.
To-day, just before adjournment,
the jury returned the long-ex
pecied indictment dealing with
the Blue Mountain reserve and the al
leged frauds the Government claims
were attempted to be perpetrated by
its creation. In the indictment are im
plicated John H. Mitchell, Binger Her
mann, John X. Williamson, Frank
Pierce Mays, W. N. Jones and George
Sorenson. The charge is that the de
fendants attempted to defraud the
Government of the United States of
the possession and use of and title to
200,000 acres of land situated in vari
ous States and Territories of the na
tion of a total value of more than $3,
000,000.
The adjournment of the Jury to-day
is to enable Heney to go to Washing
ton for the purpose of arguing a mo
tion for a writ of habeas corpus in the
Hyde-Dimond case, before the Supreme
Court of the United States.
Heney expects to be away from this
city about a month. On his return it
is believed he will reconvene the Grand
Jury, and that the session which will
follow will be as productive of impor
tant indictments as the one which has
just passed.
The most interesting indictment re
turned during the present session of
the Federal Jury is the accusation of
former United States District Attorney
John Hall; ex-Major Harry L. Reese,
who for several weeks last fall was
acting division paymaster of the Unit
ed States army in this city and who
was recently cashiered for embezzle
ment; John Cordano, formerly one of
Sheriff Word's deputies; ex-District
Attorney Charles F. Lord; J. H.
Hutchings, a lawyer, and John North
rup, one of the members of the jury
which disagreed in the United States
Government against George Sorenson,
who was tried on a charge of attempt
ing to bribe Hall. All the accused re
side in this city.
The indictrrient charges that between
December 16. 1904, and January 9, 1905,
the defendants violated the Federal
statute which makes it a crime to en
deavor to influence, intimidate or im
pede an offirer of a United States court
in the discharge of his duty. Specifi
cally, it charges these persons with
having entered into a conspiracy to
blacken the character of United States
District Attorney F. J. Heney by cir
culating reports which connected He
ney's name with that of Marie L.
Ware, one of the defendants in the
first land frauds case, and having cir
culated these, and by inducing the Dis
trict Attorney of Multnomah County,
Ore., to begin a criminal action against
Heney on the strength of this trumped
up scandal. â¢
The purpose of this alleged conspir
acy, according to the indictment, was
to bring Heney into disfavor with the
Department of Justice at Washington
and ultimately cause his removal from
office.
A subpena duces tecum issued at the
United States District Court was
served to-day on Judge A. H. Tanner
United States Senator John Mitchell's
law partner, directing him to produce
all the correspondence between him
and Senator Mitchell relative to Fred
erick n. Kribp, for whom It is alleged
the firm of Mitchell & Tanner acted as
attorneys, and for receiving an alleged
bribe from whom Mitchell was indicted
by the Federal Grand Jury February 8.
Judge Tanner at once obeyed the writ
and the correspondence Is now in the
hands of the court.
CHICAGO BOY CONFESSES
TO NTNE ROBBERIES
CHICAGO. Feb. *13. â Af^er confess
ing: to nine robberies, Edward Flafiff,
a 17-year-old boy, has been sent back
to his cell at the Stockyards police
station "to think of the rest." The
boy asked for and was given paper
and pencil. He said he would write
down each burglary he had been in
volved in as it came to his mind.
Edward said he lived at the News
boys' Home on Wabash avenue. His
father, he said, ia a switchman and
his mother is dead. The boy had two

NEW YORK, Feb. 13.â When the
March calendar of the United States
Circuit Court is called one of the most
important cases that will appear there
will cc that of Rankin vs. Harper, in
volving a suit for the recovery of $5,
000,000, which is the principal and in
terest of a judgment that has been
pending for sixteen years.
In the trial of the suit there will be
rehearsed the life history of a remark
able man. Few careers have been more
eventful than that of Edward L. Har
per and few men have had more diffi
culties to surmount during the last
twenty years and successfully accom
plished what they had set out to do.
Pardoned from the Ohio penitentiary,
where he had been serving a ten years'
sentence as one of a company of bank
v.reckers, E. L. Harper is to-day living
in a fashionable part of this city and
is the principal executive officer in a
great corporation, with interests in
volving millions, and enjoys the confi
dence of financiers whose names are
known the world (flfer. All this has
been accomplished In a space of seven
years, while he was being harassed al
most constantly by court proceedings
growing out of the failure of the Fidel
ity Bank of Cincinnati in 1887.
The story of Harper's rehabilitation
is brought up to date by recent de
velopments in Cincinnati, where, it is
said, there has been discovered a docu
ment which may serve the purpose of
both proving Harper to have been only,
an agent in the negotiations which led
to the failure of the Fidelity Bank and
relieving him of obligations which will
permit of his reaching a still more
prominent place in the commercial and
financial world.
Cleared of the responsibility under
which he has rested for years, Harper
can hold interests in the Union Iron
and Steel Company, from which he is
debarred now. Under present condi
tions he has had to accept a salary for
his services as an officer in the cor
poration.

DENVER, Feb. 13.â When the joint

Peabody-Adams gubernatorial contest
was called to order this afternoon it
was discovered that Juan de Dios
Montez, County Clerk of Huerfano

Adams alleged, that the grossest

Democrats, wanted Montez punished
for contempt, but that matter was
held in abeyance while an effort was
being made to have the box produced.
Four witnesses from Adams County

As an incident to the issue between

giving its approval on January 11 last

United States Senate committed itself
to the recognition of its power to dele

PHILADELPHIA, Feb. 13.â Unless
the Board of Pardons, which will meet
in Harrisburg on Wednesday, recom
mends the commutation of the death
sentences of Mrs. Kate Edwards and
Samuel Greason, a negro, of Berks
County, the woman and her accom
plice will be hanged on Thursday of
this week In the Reading jail for the
rrurder of John Edwards, the husband
ot the woman.
The case came before the Supreme
Court finally to-day in two petitions,
one by the woman, in which she held
(treason blameless of the murder of
her husband and prayed that he be
given a new trial, and another by
Greason, in which he asked for a re
opening of his case on the ground of
newly discovered evidence. Both peti
tions were refused. No opinion was
tiled, the papers simply being indorsed
"Refused."
The newly discovered evidence re
ferred to in the Greason case was the
confession of Mrs. Edwards in which
she stated that Greason had no con
nection with the crime; that she killed
her husband and that her daughter
Mary assisted her in throwing her hus

Hoch made a statement to-day that
his matrimonial ventures were not love
affairs. Said he:
I want to correct one impression of me
given the public. All arÂ« led to believe I am
a regular Romeo. I did not love any of my
wives. I have no use for women. It was
purely a business proposition with me. When
I found they had money I went after that.
"When I got it I left them. They had no
charms for me. I advertised for women over
45. I found they were easier to separate from
their money. Flattery was my chief stock in

way than any other.

ANOTHER BLOW AT PRESIDENT.
Spooner's Report Will Attack Validity
of Recess Appointments.
WASHINGTON. Feb. 13.-Senator
Spooner has prepared a report con
taining the views of the Senate Com
mittee on Judiciary on the resolu
tion introduced by Senator Tillman
asking an opinion on the ripht of the
President to make recess appointments
between adjournment of one session of
Congress and the convening of another,
when the two sessions are merged into
each other. The report denies that the
President has a right to construe a
recess and suggests certain limitations
upon the President's power to appoint
men to office during a recess of Con
gress, whose nominations have been
sent in and considered, but not con
firmed at a former session.
Disappointment in London.
LONDON, Feb. 13. â The announce

the arbitration treaties, in conse
quence of the Senate's action in sub
stituting the term "treaty" for
"agreement." is received with some
degree of surprise, but with no evi
dence of concern in official circles in
London. Disappointment was ex
exprossed at the Foreign Office to-day,
but officials there said they were con
fident that a treaty upon which ;ill
parties could agree would be signed
ultimately.
MERCURY CUDDLES UP AT BOTTOM
OF EAST'S THERMOMETERS.
45-BELOW-ZERO OZONE
ADDS TO ZEST OF LIVING
CHICAGO, Feb. 13.â Not during th?
last six years has the equal of the
present cold weather been experienced
in the West and in many planes no
such low temperatures have been re
corded since the establishment of the
Weather Bureau.
The cold wave extends from Canada
to the Gulf of Mexico and from the
Rocky Mountains to the Atlantic.
Freezing weather is reported all
through the South. In the North the
mercury has registered all the way
from zero to 45 degrees below, the lat
ter mark being scored at Richland
Center, Wis.
Trains everywhere from the West
and Northwest are from two to twelve
hours late and from the packing of the
snow in the cuts it is expected that It
will be several days before the roads
are able to restore the schedule time
of trains. Many persons lost their
lives, the majority of the fatalities be
ing in the Southwest, where the dis
tances between houses and towns are
great.
The loss of cattle on the ranges will
be very heavy. YV. E. Bolton, secre
tary of the Oklahoma Livestock Asso
ciation, declared to-night that the live
stock losses in the present cold weath
er would be the greatest since the
great blizzard of 18S6. He places tne
number of cattle lost on the range in
"Western Kansas, Western Oklahoma
and the Panhandle of Texas at 30,000.
Farther nortb, In Nebraska and the
Dakotas and Montana, the stockmen
are better prepared to shelter their
stock. Their cattle are being sheltered
from the cold and it is not expected
their losses will be anything nearly so
heavy as those on the ranges farther
to the south.
Officially speaking this was the cold
est day in Chicago since February 9,
189Â», when the mercury registered 2:5
degrees below zero, which stands as
the record for cold weather in the local
Weather Bureau. In the opinion of
pedestrians on the street and according
to the showing of unofficial thermome
ters the Government thermometer was
anywhere from 4 to 12 degrees too
warm. The official record was 19 de
grees below, while throughout the city
temperatures from 20 to 25 were com
mon, while In some of the suburbs as
low as 33 below zero was touched. At
10 o'clock to-night the Weather Bu
reau issued a statement to the effect
that it was 6 degrees below, while on
the street it was 12 below. All through
the day the bitter cold was intensified
by a wind that blew from the north
west at a rate of thirty miles an hour.
No deaths were reported in the city
proper, but the police were compelled
to care for numberless frostbites
throughout the day.
At the water cribs In lake Michigan,
the" workmen who are engaged in keep
ing the intakes clear of ice had a des
perate time of It. The mercury was
30 below, and the men were compelled
to work in shifts of fifteen minutes, it
being impossible for them to endure
the cold wind for a" long perJod at one
time.
The severe cold has brought upon
the South a renewal of all the trouble
visited upon it by the recent storm of
sleet which has demoralized railroad
traffic and almost destroyed telegraphic
communication in some parts of that
section. The cold spread with great
speed throughout the South, accom
panied by heavy snowfalls in somÂ«
States.
Temperatures to-night In the prin
cipal cities of the West and Northwest
were reported as follows: Cheyenne,
24 degres above zero; Cleveland, Â«
above; Denver, 32 above; Detroit, 2
below; Indianapolis, 10 below: Kan
sas City. Cincinnati and St. Louis. 4
below; Milwaukee, 8 below; New Or
leans, 24 above; Omaha, 2 above.
WORST OVER IN COLORADO.
Indications That Warmer Weather Is
About to Follow.
DENVER, Feb. 13. â The local
Weather Bureau reports that the
backbone of the cold snap is broken
so far as the section immediately east
of the mountains in Colorado, Wyom
ing and New Mexico is concerned, al
though it is colder to-night on the
western slope in Colorado. Clear
fkies were reported from New Mexico.
Similar moderation was reported all
along the eastern slope to Cheyenne,
Wyo. The fact that no reports were
received from Yellowstone Park led to
the belief that weather conditions are
interfering with communication in
Northern Wyoming.
On the continental divide in Colo
rado and Northern New Mexico a
heavy snowfall occurred on Saturday
and Sunday. It was said that an east
bound Rio Grande passenger train was
snowbound on Marshall Pass and that
the passengers, some sixty in num
ber, were suffering from cold and lack
of food. This was erroneous. The
train in question had been held at Sar
geants while rotaries cleared the
track of snow. Interruption of the
telegraph service made It impossible
to communicate with the stalled train,
hence the sensational rumor.
The Rio Grande was also compelled
to hold westbound trains at Salida be
cause of the snow. All delayed trains
resumed their schedules at 6 o'clock
this afternoon.
COLDEST WEATHER KXOWX.
Records Broken in States of the
Middle West.
KANSAS CITY, Mo., Feb. 13. â The
climax of the severe cold spell, which
began on January 1, since whtch time
the temperature has never risen above
the freezing point, was reached at 6
o'clock this morning when 21.2 de
grees below zero was recorded by
the Government thermometer. The
weather forecaster concedes that the
low record of 22 degrees below zero on
February 12, 1889, has been broken,
as the official instruments were af
fected by the dense smoke from chim
neys near by. The coldest January on
record is being followed by an unpre
cedented February.
This statement of conditions in Kan
sas City may be extended to Western
Missouri. Kansas, Nebraska, Okla
homa and Indian Territory, all po!nt3
reporting the coldest weather of the
winter and most of them the coldest
ever known. A dozen persons have
been reported frozen to death in the
Southwest in the past two days. Win
ter wheat is covered by snow and is
not affected by the cold. Stock losses
are not heavy because owners had
ample warning. Trains on all rail
roads are delayed by snowdrifts.

AT MERCY OF STORM.
Steamship Disabled and Driven Among
Great Ice Floes.
ST. JOHNS, Newfoundland. Feb. 15.
The long overdue steamship Sylvia.
from New York to Halifax, arrived
here this afternoon after a. terrific ex
perience in a blizzard which struck
her on Wednesday, driving her eighty
miles seaward, among the great Ice
t!oes on the Grand Banks. The en
gines broke down for twenty-four
hours in the height of the storm, dur
ing which all the passengers and cr-^v
labored incessantly at the pumps, ex
pecting momentarily that the ship
would founder.
After the storm had abated thÂ« en
gines were repaired and on Saturday
the steamship reached Trepassey,
where she remained until this morn
ing and then started for this port.

Hearst and Sullivan Tell What
They Know About Each Other
WASHINGTON. Feb. 13.â Not in re
cent years has the House witnessed
such a disgraceful spectacle as it did
to-day, with Sullivan of Massachusetts
and William K. Hearst of X- w York as
the central figures. Both indulged in
personalities of the gravest character
and stirred the House so as to arouse
among certain members a feeling of
the greatest indignation. Sullivan
heaped upon Hearst a tirade of denun
ciation, while the latter, by implica
tion, charged Sullivan with complicity
In a murder.
The affair grew out of the recent dis
cussion of the freight rate question in
the House, when Sullivan inquired of
1-amax of Florida, who was favoring
the Hearst bill, why Hearst did not
defend his own bill, this being followed
by a criticism of Sulltvan in the New
York American and Journal.
Several appeals were made to Speak
er Cannon to cause the two men to de
â lÂ«t In their abuse of each other.
Ppeaker Cannon, however, allowed
them to proceed. Sullivan entirely con
cluded, but In the case of Hearst the
Ppeaker, on reconsideration, noticing
the temper of the House, decided that
an accusation of homicide against a
fellow member was unparliamentary,
because It waa calculated to provoke
disorder and disturbance. Almost im
mediately thereafter Hearst took his
seat, hurling defiance and declaring
that It would be his pride to continue
hie hostility to Individuals such as he
charged Sullivan to be.
SCLLIYA*' ANSWERS IXSULT.
Sullivan took the floor immediately
after the reading of the Journal at
noon to-day. He had prepared his
speech in advance and read Ix. through
out. After he had explained the pur
pose of his remarks he read the article
in the New York American to which
he had taken offense. This, he said,
touched him in his representative ca
pacity and was a deliberate Insult from
one member of the House to another.
At this point Robinson of Indiana in
terrupted to make the point of order
that Sullivan was violating the rules
of the House. There were Quite gen
eral expressions of disapproval of Rob
inson's point ajid it was some time be-
Speaker Cannon could restore or
â¢. pronounce his ruling. He held
that the language used at that time
'ictly In order.
uon read the rule governing the
point and Sullivan proceeded, but with
vigorous denunciation as to bring
- another point of order from Rob-
Speaker Cannon paid he would
to h^ar the words read again. He
for Sullivan's manuscript and the
-sr clerk alowly repeated the par
h questioned. This paragraph
fflthinfrly assailed the Presidential as
pirations of the gentleman from New
York. Cannon ruled the speech in or
(iÂ»r and no further interruptions were
HEARST ARISES TO REPLT.
Hearst arose at once to reply to Sul
livan when the latter took his seat. He
had to wait two minutes for order. His
reply was brief, the sensational part
being contained in the concluding sen
tences, which by inference charged Sul
livan with murder. Hearst said he as-
Fumed entire responsibility for the ar
ticle â¢which had aroused Sullivan's in
dignation, although, he said, he had
rot inspired it, nor did he know in ad
vgnce of its intended publication. He
eaid he was glad to incur the hostility
'of that class of individuals." Previous
to this he had reviewed the attack
made upon him by Representative
Grove L. Johnson of California, and
paid that Johnson's defeat for Congress
was the result.
Sullivan after the House adjourned
pp'd hn would take the floor to-morrow
*nd answer the reflection upon him
contained 1n Hearst's speech.
\ ITrPEJRVTIYE ARTICLE READ.
At the cutset of his speech to-day
Pulllvan said that he had given his no
tice early Jn order that Hearst might
-'â¢sent. He had Interrupted La
mar, he said, because he thought La
mar was criticizing too harshly his
Democratic colleagues for their failure
to support the so-called Hearst bill, and
ho felt that Hearst himself might pro
duce the desired effect. Ordinarily, he
F*ld, public men expect fair criticism
of their official acts, but where the pro
prietor of a paper Is a member of Con
gress he owes a double duty to his col
leagues to be fair and impartfal in his
criTjrlsms of them. He read the article
In the New Tork American of February
? In criticism of himself, which he said
had be^n called forth by an infraction
monarchical dignity and
1 hereby had been consigned to the po
assassins of Hearst's paper. The
article in question, Sullivan said,
touched his representative capacity and
was "a deliberate insult to one member
by another." Continuing Sullivan said:
TTiÂ« writer ratios the Inquiry whether my
Ignorance of pending measures was due to
congenital incapacity or Indifference to the
people's rights. Congenital incapacity is a.
w>rious charse, yet obviously one which a
l'frscn accused wouH net care to discus*. If
the charge Is true, he is not ruiity, but un
fortunate, end It is surely a, grievous misfor
tune not to be able to appreciate the value of
the legislative services of the gentleman from
NÂ»w York. But congenital Incapability to un
derstand in a v,-ord which covers a wide range
of mental and moral deficiency. It covers the
cntc of the oral degenerate, the unclean, un
j-.wxiurtive, nhiftless members of â  society, and
it lrdu'Jos the man who. totally bereft of thÂ«
*ercse of propriety, raises his profaning eyes
tc*vat-<t the splendid temple of the people's
hisht-st riftâ the Presidency of tlif. United
s-'tat'-s â blissfully unconscious of the woeful
<-cntr.-st between the qualifications requisite
for that hiÃh office and hlÂ« own contemptible
moral wraiptnest;
Ml \KST A "YELLOW PERIL.'
Sullivan referred to Hearst as "the
v. r. mar, or political novice, whose
nunendatfoa is his inherited
h."
The scheme of political assassination,
he said, had been mapped out evident
ly with the idea of destroying the re
spectable dements of the Democratic
jiarty. He commended Williams, the
minority leader, for refusing to indorse
the Hearst rate bill; also "a refusal of
that leader to. stoop to a controversy
with a contemptible opponent." In con
cluding Sullivan said:

A< < CSATION OF MURDER.
As soon . as Sullivan concluded
Hearst arose. Replying to Sullivan's
criticism that Hearst had been guilty
of lack of action in the House, Hearst
said he was proceeding in the way he
thought most effective to his constitu
ents. â  He did not know any way by
which a man could be less effective
for his constituents "than in emitting
, chewed wind on the floor of the
: House."
Hearst then began a review of the
attack' upon him by Representative
Grove L. Johnson of California, when
he was interrupted by Payne of New
York, who alleged the remarks were
unparliamentary.
"I ask for fair' play," demanded
Griggs of Georgia. â¢
Payne withdrew his point and
Hearst proceeded. He declared that
he had no desire to criticize Sullivan,
because if he had he would not have
done it in so puerile a manner. He
then sprang a sensation which threw
the House in an uproar. He charged
that John A. Sullivan was one of two
brothers who had kept a saloon in
Boston where a murder was commit
ted and that the two Sulllvans were
indicted for manslaughter.
"I would like to ask the gentleman
from Massachusetts," calmly inquired
Hearst, "what he knows about the in
cident?"
Sullivan arose and facing Hearst,
said:
"If thÂ« gentleman is asking that
question of me I will be very glad to
answer it."
Hearst ignored the remark, how
ever.
HOUSE IN AN UPROAR.
"This Is riot a washshop," shouted
Butler of Pennsylvania, who appealed
to the Srjeaker to know if there was
any power to prevent a continuance
of the discussion.
The Speaker ruled that Hearst was
proceeding by unanimous consent,
and besides, he was not sure that
Hearst was specifically referring to
Sullivan, not being familiar with his
given name.
"But, Mr. Speaker." said Butler,
"he has Inferentlally charged the
gentleman with murder."
Butler was thoroughly enraged and
as he walked across the aisle, ex
claimed:
"This is not fair to the country."
After the excitement had subsided
Hearst, resuming, â  said he recognized
the Justice of the remarks of â  Butler
about the turn of affairs, and that he
greatly ; regretted it; but. he added,
he was compelled in defense of him
self "to define the character of men
who have made their attacks upon
me." It was. he said, the duty of a
newspaper when such men were in
public life to refer to their, past and
their character. .
At this juncture Speaker Cannon,
noting the effect on the House of
Hearst's charge, Interrupted and de
clared that "an accusation of homi
cide against a member, seems to fall
within the parliamentary prohibition,
calculated to provoke disturbance and
disorder and to bring the body itself
into contempt and criticism."
The . Speaker's admonition caused
Hearst to cut short his remarks with
a statement that he was proud of the
hostility of such as Sullivan and that
he would continue "to incur the hos*
tllity of .that class of individuals" so
long as he was In journalism or In
Congress.
Hearst, .ln an interview on the day's
Incidents in the House of Representa
tives, said: .
I need not say that I consider to-day's ses
sion of the House . olsagreeable to all and ab
solutely disgraceful to those who deliberately
planned such a scene and forced it upon m>
eelf and other unwilling members. I feel that
they deserved the disagreeable shock and dis
comfiture that met them when they learned
through me the extremely appropriate kind of
man whom they had selected as their mouth
piece.

the prosecution on behalf of the de
fendants, and Gavin McNab analyzed
the evidence introduced In support of
the affidavit given by William Corbin
upon which the investigation was held.
It was alter 8 o'clock when Chairman
Belshaw rapped for order. The word
had gone out that it was French's in
tention to come before the committee,
accompanied by counsel, and demand
that he be heard, notwithstanding the
decision of the Senate that the rights
of the people should not be jeopardized
by allowing the accused to take the
stand and thus immune themselves
from prosecution in the criminal courts
of the State. But if French had any
such ideas he abandoned them before
the hearing was called. He remained
in his seat during the argument, ap
parently well pleased with Catoi's
vituperative methods. Bunkers re
mained in the lobby, smiling broadly
as his counsel damned his accusers as
the offscourings of hell, the creatures
of San Francisco's sewers, liars,
perjurers and self-confessed felons.
Neither Wright nor Emmons was in
evidence. The report was in circula
tion to-day that Wright had deter
mined to turn State's evidence, but
this is flatly denied by counsel for the
accused, who say that neither of their
clients has anything to confess, so con
sequently none of them could turn
State's evidence if he so desired.
PLEA OF ACCUSED.
Before launching into his argument
Cator presented a petition on behalf of
the accused, the main plea of which
is that the Senate do not condemn the
accused until they have had a fair and
impartial trial in a criminal court, it
being the contention of the accused
that if the Senate find adversely to
their interests it will influence the re
turn of a verdict against them in the
trial they must undergo for their lib
erty. This petition is as follows:
First, they respectfully protest against any
report upon the guilt of said accused Senators
being made herein until a verdict shall have
b<*en rendered by a jury upon the indictments
now pending- in the criminal courts of Sacra
mento County because such a rrport Is sought
by the persons prosecuting before this commit
tee for the jyirpose of prejudicing such ac
cused in the trial to be had In such criminal
courts and to be used to Influence and bias
the minds of the people of Sacramento County,
from which a Jury must be drawn to try the
accused, and because a report by this commit
tte might deprive the said accused from ob
taining an impartial jury and a fair trial upon
auch indictments.
Second; because It is the practice of the
Senate of the United States not to raise a
committee to report against or question the
f?"at;< of ltt members charged with bribery
upon which criminal indlctmenU are being
prosecuted until after the verdict of a Jury
and the affirmance thereof, a." Is witnessed in
the cases of Senators Mitchell of Oregon and
Burton of Kansas, now under Indictments for
receiving bribes to use their influence as Sen
ators in violation of law, who still sit In their
seats in the Senate of the United States.
Third, because In the present case the per
fons prosecuting these accused Senators before
this committee, having given all their testi
mony under oath before this committee hav
ing objected to the accused being heard in the
same manner.
Fourth, because the District Attorney of
Sacramento County, having taken the entire
case before the Grand Jury of said county and
having procured indictment* In the criminal
courts and having applied to the Senate ot
California to prohibit the accused from making
their defense under oath in the usual manner,
and the Senate having granted such request
and having deprived the accused of the right
to be sworn and give their tstimony as the
prosecution has done; and in the usual way
such action on the part of the Senate amounts
to turning the rase over to the District At
torney and the criminal courts for trial before
the accused are heard in defense by the Senate
In the usual manner, and therefore it Is not
right or Just that a report under such clrcum-
Etances should be made by the committee upon
Incomplete evidence, which report might pre
vent the accused from obtaining an unbiased
and fair Jury in the courts of cald county.
INDICTMENTS FTLED.
Fifth, because on the eve of February 10
when the accused Senators were still defend
ing themselves before this committee and
as said committee was about to meet the
prosecution caused indictments to be filed af
ter 7 o'clock p. m. against the accused by
(â¢ending for a Judge to hts house and procur
ing bench warrants to be issued thereon and
arrested three of the accused and sought the
fourth and took them away from their de
fense ani opportunity to participate in their
defense, although no suggestion exists that
there was any occasion to arrest such accused
at that unseemly hour or Inappropriate time.
That the accused have each arisen in their
scats in the Senate of California In the pres
ence of the Senate and of the Senators on this
committee, and upon the reading of the said
affidavit of sai.i William Corbin each of said
accused solemnly and with all the power pos
sible tc parsers not under oath, did each
deny for himself nil the charges of bribery
contained in said affidavit, which statements
f.tan-1 as the denial of the accused, who, be
ing denied thÂ»:r junt and lawful' rights to
make such denial under oath, cannot make
any stronger denial.
That protesting' against the action denying
thes? accused '.he right to testify under oath
in their de Tense, but without the power to
change the order of the Senate In this re
spect, they solemnly protest against a report
by this committee upon Incomplete evidence
being made aftor their Indictment and before
their trial In court, which might prevent their
obtaining an unbiased jury and a fair trial,
end demand in common fairness that the ie
port of this committee In accord with the
practice of the Senate of the UniL>d States be
deferred until after the verdict of v Jury upon
the trial of such Indictments.
After presenting this petition Cator
proceeded with his argument, saying
in part:
The prosecution in this case cares not
whether the accused are permitted to retain
tl;eir seats or not. But I believe that If these
men are guilty, that If their guilt is estab
hfliefl beyond a reasonable deubt, they
should not only be expelled from this Senate,
tut should be punished under the criminal
statults. I am the last man In the world to
Eay that they rhoulJ not receive full punish
ment for their offense if they have committed
any but I maintain and will continue to main
tain until shown to the contrary that they
are guiltless anc 1 that no evidence establishing
their guilt has been introduced here.
BATTLE FOR LIFE.
TV* are confronted here with the spectacle
or a great corporation engaged in a batt!>- for
itÂ« life with a newspaper, in IM midst of oil

enough Fail to themselves. "If we can but
explode a charge of bribery here it will

They they proceeded, : as; they say, though
â¢we- claim otherwise, to lay the trap for the
accused. -â¢ Even , though i their claims ; were ' true,

â  \ SORRY FOR McNAB. v' â  " â¢
After making i it : clear i that this last
statement referred to Detectives Tich
enor and : Hartling and Joseph S. Jor
dan, Attorney Cator. continued :
I am friendly with Mr. McNab. I am sorry
that ho has engaged In such practices as this.
He is the leader of awing of a divided politi
cal party that, when united, can elect any one,
and as . such leader he has a good standing
and should have taken better methods to carry
out his ends. â¢'::â¢â¢-'.
McNab joined as '.:â  heartily - In the
laugh that followed this sally as any
of the less interested audience. Â ,
Continuing, Cator : ttacked the tes
timony of Tichenor, Jordan and Hart-,
ling and referred to Jordan as J a trai
tor, quoting at great \ length â¢" from
Moore on that poet's contempt â¢ for a
traitor, i Cator . referred to % the . traitor
end no more, however, ; after it was
pointed out to him that in *no event
could Jordan be a traitor : unless the*
accused Senators were : guilty as he
claimed. '
Cator laid great stress on variations of
distances, and locations as described in
the testimony of Tichenor and : Hart
ling in opposition to contentions of
Jordan. He also laid stress on the fact
that Tichenor testified ' that : when the
bills were handed to Emmons and Bun
kers they were rolled up, while Hart
ling testified, they were unfolded when
handed to them by Jordan. ;.
EXAMINER PLOT.
In conclusion Cator again appealed
to the committee to- suspend Its Judg
ment until after the trial in the crimi
nal courts had been concluded and
then gave way to McNab.
McNab paid attention to the Exam
iner and said the conspiracy was
hatched in the office of that paper and
grew from the time the pictures of the
four Senators in pictures like those of
Washington crossing the Delaware
were published by it as those of the de
fenders of the people's rights. No pic
tures of the other three members of
the Committee on Commissions and
Retrenchmentâ Coggins, Rambo and
Bauerâ were published. The telegrams
were to the other four, French being
the one who was looked to for action.
The SDeaker admitted that he had
some bias in the matter, which was
natural under the circumstances, he
said. William It. Hearst, owner of the
Examiner, had started out to ruin him
because he had opposed him politically.
He was trying to crush McNab and
whatever persons and institutions he
was connected with. McNab related
some of the well-known history of
Hearst's fights against him.
To show that tirange acted in good
faith In laying a trap to catch the four
Senators, and that he had no Intention
of really trying to bribe, McNab recited
the fact that Grange had sent the
money he had collected for the purpose
of laying the trap to the Bulletin of
fice, where it was exchanged for
marked bills to be sent to Sacramento.
Had Grange been acting otherwise
than In good faith he would not have
turned his money Into a newspaper of
fice to be substituted for bills that
could be identified.
Referring to the fact that Grange was
being pursued outside the Senate court
of inquiry, McNab said that one of the
worst charges made against him was
that he bought his wife good clothes.
In concluding the attorney said his
side had given the committee all Its
knowledge of the bribery, presenting
everything fully and promptly, answer-
Ing every process and producing every
thing called for.
Chairman Belshaw announced that
the committee would hold no more pub
lic meetings, but would hereafter meet
in executive session until it had thor
oughly gone over the evidence and de
cided on Its report to the Senate.
The committee I appointed ;to ' investi
gate the bribery scandal involving four
State Senators will bring In its ; report
as ' soon ! as possible. V This . decision was
reached at an executive meeting of the
committee held immediately, after, the
session in the Senate chamber to-night.
The > committee ' decided that p the re
quest of â  the ."counsel ; for ' the accused
Senators that the report be postponed
until after the findings of the criminal
court could not be granted. :

AGRICULTURAL FARM
MEASURE DISCUSSED
BY THE COMMITTEE
Tie Vote on Bill
Prevents Favor
able Report.
Special Dispatch to The Call
SACRAMENTO, Feb. 13. â The
Committee on Ways and Means con
sidered to-night the bill providing an
appropriation of $250,000 for an ag
ricultural farm to be connected with
the State University. President
Wheeler of the institution appeared
and urged a favorable report upon
the measure. It Is likely the commit
tee will reDort in favor of an appro
priation of $150,000 for the farm.
President Wheeler and other pro
fessors of the university appeared be
for the Judiciary Committee relative
to the bill prohibiting the acceptance
of fees by university professors for
private work.
There was a tie vote of 7 to 7 on a
proposition to report the bill favor
ably. As no recommendation could
be made a motion was carried to ap
point a select committee of three to
amend the bill so it would be ac
ceptable. Waste, McGowan and Gans
were appointed. Any bill that can be
suggested to restrict the acceptance
of fees for chemical analysis and
other private work done by the pro
fessors at whom the bill is aimed will
be obnoxious to them so the select
committee is not expected to bring
any harmony out of the trouble.
EDITOR IN TROUBLE-
Santa Crux Journalist Charged With
Contempt of Assembly.
SACRAMENTO, Feb. 13.â At to
night's session of the Assembly a reso
lution that Arthur A. Taylor of the
Santa Cruz Surf be summoned before
that body, to show cause why ho should
not be punished for contempt, was in
troduced.
The desire to hale Taylor before the
Assembly, as has already been pub
lished, grows directly out of the stric
tures in his paper upon the committee
appointed by Speaker Prescott to in
vestigate charges against Superior
Judge Smith and report whether there
was ground for the jurist's trial by the
Senate. The committee is wroth and is
going to have it out with the Santa
Cruz editor, who is in the lists against
Smith, before it goes to Santa Cruz.
Waste introduced the resolution cit
ing the editor to appear. It recites
that "with intent and purposes to in
terrupt and interfere with the due
course of the investigation by the said
committee," Arthur A. Taylor publish
ed in his paper on February 8 certain
articles reflecting on the committee
members. The resolution goes on to
say that the "statements are malicious
ly false and untrue and made with the
object of belittling the committee and
discrediting its report and the same is
a contempt of the lawful authority,
dignity and proceedings of this As
sembly."
The resolution further provides that
the sergeant at arms shall serve the
subpena on Editor Smith, command
ing him to appear on February 20â
next Monday.
HOURS OF DRUGGISTS.
Bill Making Ten-Hour Day Passed by
Senate.
SACRAMENTO. Feb. 13.â The Sen
ate accomplished little to-day, the Lin
coln exercises occupying the entire
morning session. Mattos* bill, forbid
ding the payment of municipal officers
out of the funds of counties, was de
feated, as was Stanton's Assembly bill
providing for the assessment of the
cost of lighting streets on the property
benefited thereby. As to the latter bill
a majority of the Senate held that the
lighting of citjÂ£s is a matter of general
benefit and one cities as a whole should
pay for. The following bills were
finally passed:
By Belshaw: An act legalizing ap
plications for and to confirm title to
tide, swamp and salt marsh lands,
when such titles or applications cover
one of such kinds of lands when in fact
the land described is another of such
kinds of land.
By Atkinson: To fix the hours of la
bor of retail drug clerks at ten hours
a day.
By Lumley: An act to provide for
the organization and government of
Irrigation districts and to provide for
the acquisition or construction thereby
of works for the irrigation of lands em
braced within such districts.
HARTMAN IS ANGRY.
Wants to Be Investigated bj Special
Committee.
SACRAMENT^, Feb. 13.â The Com
mittee on Insurance and Insurance
Laws has reported against the passage
of Assemblyman Hartman's bill
against insurance compacts, but its
author will still fight for its passage
and will have something to say when
it is called up for second reading,
probably on Tuesday. At one of the
committee meetings Attorney Hunter,
representing the Fireman's Fund In
surance Company, said the bill was
similar to the one introduced by BretÂ«
of Alameda fourteen years ago, and
added:
"And you know what happened to
him."
Hartman, who says the measure
was introduced in good faith because
he believes it is a good law, construed
this aa a threat and he is going to
rise to a question of personal privi
lege on the floor of the house and de
mand the appointment of a committee
to investigate himself and report
whether he had ulterior motives in in
troducing the measure.

MARTYR PRESIDENT'S
BIRTHDAY HONORED
BY THE LEGISLATORS
Eloquent Speakers
Pay Tribute to
Lincoln.
t-i)ecial Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Feb. 13.â Impressive
ceremonies commemorative of the birth
of Abraham .Lincoln were heid in the
Assembly chamber to-day, both houses
attending. The lower house conducted
business up to 11 o'clock, when the
Senators marched in, led by Secretary
Lewis Hilborn and Governor Pardee,
the orchestra playing "Yankee Doodle'
as they filed to the seats provided for
them. Speaker Prescott delivered some
remarks of greeting to the Governor
and the Senators and Rev. W. S. Hos
kinson, the Senate chaplain, delivered
the invocation.
Introductory remarks were made by
Lieutenant* Governor Anderson. He
said the grandest heritage of the na
tion was the free institutions estab
lished by her great men. Lincoln, more
than any other man, he said, personified
and dignified the practical application
of the spirit of human freedom.
Senator M. L. Ward of San Diego
spoke on the boyhood of Lincoln. He
dwelt on his early life when he lived
in a rude log cabin and read the few
books he had by the light of the fire
place. All the essentials to make a
great character surrounded him. On
such a foundation any man of noble
purpose and great intellect could have
been great.
Assemblyman Drew addressed the
assemblage on "Lincoln the Man." He
said the strength of the cable depended
on its individual fiber and the strength
of a nation on the patriotism of its
individuals. Of the two great nations
that were now warring one was strong
because of the intense patriotism of
ita subjects, the other weak because
of the lack of it. The speaker pictured
Lincoln at the midnight hour, while
the battle of the Wilderness was on,
pacing up and down, the weight of the
nation's troubles upon him. His h^art
bled for the boys in the field. To him
the voice of the people was the voice
of God. Self was secondary with him.
His life and character could be set
forth as the great example for the
American people, the speaker said.
Senator Thomas H. Selvage ot Hum
boldt spoke of "Lincoln the President."
He pictured him taking his seat while
the integrity of the republic was being
undermined and threatened with de
struction. His dominating influence
led the people aright, the speaker said.
His was the spirit that guided. The
speaker quoted Lincoln's remark that
"the integrity of the I'nion must and
shall be preserved" and dwelt upon
how he brought the nation through the
days of strife to victory and permanent
union.
Assemblyman John A. Goodrich of
Pasadena read Lincoln's Gettysburg
rddress and Assemblyman Nathan
Ooghlan of San Francisco closed the
ppeechmaking with one of his most
able orations, his subject being "The
Representative American."
North Sea Inquiry Is Closed.
PARIS, Feb. 13. â The International
commission which is inquiring into
the North Sea incident to-day heard
the conclusions of the British and
Russian agents upon the testimony
presented. To-day's session practic
ally closed the work of the commis
sion until a decision is reached, when
Admiral Fournier, the president of the
commission, will call a meeting for
the purpose of announcement. The
admirals in the meantime will hold
daily private sessions to deliberate
upon the decision. It is expected that
some days will elapse before definite
results are reached.
Eastry's Seizure a Mistake.
TOKIO, Feb. 14. â The British
steamship Eastry. which was captured
orT Hokkaido on February 7. has been
released, it having developed that her
seizure was a mistake. She was car
rying a cargo of coal from Hokkaido
to Singapore.

RAILROAD FREIGHT
RATES ATTACKED
IN THE ASSEMBLY
Strong Resolution
Is Introduced
in House.
â¢ Disuatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Feb. 13. -At this aft
ernoon's session of the Assembly Cleve
land of Santa Cruz introduced â  a con
current resolution that the Southern
Pacific Company be compelled to re
store freight rates from San Fran
cisco- to Watsonville to the figure to
which the â¢ corporation lowered them
last June, and also that the Railroad
Commission be empowered to hold a
general investigation of all existing
I rail and steamship freight and passen
, ger rates and lower them.
The resolution starts with the decla
ration that the constitution of the Â£XÂ£fc*
provides that when freight or passen
ger rates are reduced they shall not be
raised without the consent of the au
thority in which is vested the power to
raise or lower rates. Such rates have
been lowered, especially when compet
ing lines come, the resolution goes on
to say, and have been increased with
out the consent of the Railroad Com
mission, the authority referred to by
the constitution; also that this has been
the case in particular between San
Francisco and Watsonville and other
points in the Pajaro Valley, when on
June 29 last, through G. W. Luce, its
general freight agent, the rate per hun
dred pounds on all freight was reduced
to 7% cents, and that on January 6.
1905, the rates were raised to from 13&
to 25 cents per hundred pounds.
The resolution concludes as follows:
The State Board of Railroad Commissioner*
is directed and empowered to make a careful
and exhaustive. examination of freight and pas
senger rates to and from all points In Cali
fornia on all railroad ana steam-ship line* do
ing business in , said State to the end that
rates of freights and fares may be adjuÂ»t-d to
meet pr-sent conditions, which Justify a largo
reduction therein from the general scheda!*
which was adopted twÂ»nty years ago and
which has been continued except where com
petition has compelled a decrease, said exam
ination to be completed and the decision mad*
public before January 1, 1906.
The resolution was referred by the
Speaker to the Committee on Corpora
tions.
The Committee on Rules made a re
port on the question referred to It
whether the Assembly.was behind in its
work. Through McCartney, its chair
man, it filed a report, in which it was
figured that the lower house was far
ahead of other sessions at this time.
Assemblyman John A. Bliss, who la
affectionately known as the father of
the Assembly because of his long ser
vice in that house, was presented with
a handsome cut glass and silver de
canter by his colleagues to-day, this
being his sixty-second birthday. The
presentation was made through a reso
lution presented by McGowan, in which
the recipient was congratulated on his
youthful appearance and vigor.

daction of the penalty. By rood be
havior three and a half years will be
cut from Campbell's term, leaving him
â¢ - nly six and a half veers to serve.
A peculiar request in regard to the
â¢weapon with which the murder was
committed was made by Campbell. He
asked the court to have the pistol de
stroyed. Fearful that a relic hunter
misfit obtain possession of it. he wish
ed it broken in pieces and cast into the
sea- Judge Ellsworth said that he
could not make each an order, but that
t* would have tie pistol turned oxer to
Judge Frick. Â»*Â» could do whatever he
wished with it.
Campbell is a butcher, 35 years of age.
On November .- he shot and killed his
divorced wile, who was but 22 years
of age. Much sympathy was aroused
in the mind of the Jury daring the trial
cf the caÂ»e by the introduction of tes
timony to shea- that the wife's miscon

tpon Campbell's mind that in a drunk- ;

broke out on the
fourth floor of the Brevoort House, sit
uated on Madison street, between
and La Salic streets. Tbe Ore
was in the rear portion of the fourth
floor and the smoke rolling through
.ails was the first warning to tne
. employes that anything was
wrong.
A hurried call was sent to an en
gine house, do**- by the hotel, but when
'â¢ arrived they found :h^
fire was too great for them to handle
I call was sent for additional en
c.r. -
AÂ« the firemen, with their hose, ran
through the hails the guests came
pouring out of their rooms and cor
ridors were soon Qlied with excited
CMBUs, in all stages of undress, hasten
ing to the office and the street.
The employes of the hotel behaved in
the most admirable fashion and lent
every assistance to the people as they
came running down the stairs and into
tb* elevators. They were assured that
there was no immediate danger and
that there was ample time for aii to es
cape without trouble.
Some few women ran into Madison
street in scanty clothing and, believing
that the fire would amount to nothing
returned to their hotel to finish dress
ing. The rapid increase in the number
of engine* calied to the scene alarmed
them once more, however, and they
fled to the streets again.
A number of the guests of the Bre
voort hastened to the Hotel Morrison,
half a square distant, where they were
cared for. The watchmen in a number
of office buildings adjoining the Bre
voort threw open their doors and al
lowed the frightened guests of the ho
tel to seek shelter in their hallways.

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY. FEBRUARY 14. 1905.
BERKELEY. Feb. 13.â Valentines of
the sort commonly called "comic" have
been prepared by the women students
of th university for the men students
and professor?, and to-day were put on
the press and printed In the carers of
the university periodical , named The
Pelican, which comes oat. to-morrow.
The women students had the privilege

RECPON- I THE PELI
ALIAS THE GOAT.
of preparing this issue of the Pelican, i
The golden opportunity was used to fill
the publication i with valentines de
signed to convince male students and
instructors of their general unworth.
A weird poster, advertising the is
sue, has been posted on the campus
and observers surmised from Its use
of a spectacled youth with abnormal j
cranial development that the gibes at
the men folk of the college would be
neither mild nor Infrequent. The guess
was correct, as advance sheets of thÂ«*
Pelican, which the co-eds have changed
in title to read The Goat, show that
neither reverence for professors nor af
fection for male students deterred the
witty women of the university from
producing valentines . calculated to !
make the butts of the co-eds' wit mod
erately frantic. 1 ) I p oa
Captain Xance and his brass buttons
come in for pictorial and written satire
as do also Professor Gayley and T> rt^
fÂ«-Â«,r Moses, each of whom "has
aroused the co-eds' ire in the past.
Gayley has barred co-eds from his
classes when he thought they inter
fered with the rights of the male stu
dents, and Moses once Jbored the soror
ity girls for taking his cherry blos
soms, without leave, to decorate their

AT A MURDER
Detectives Work on a Theory
That Eleanor KoeliÃ 3light
Have shnt Spouse in Anger
SUGGEST THKEATEXLV<;>
Attorney Advise the Yonng
Husband to Get Away
From Relatives of Bride
Oakland OlÃce San Francisco Call.
19 If Broadway. Feb. 13.
F. >anor Koehn, the young bride
who yesterday shot to death her hus
band. Edward R. Koehn. at their
home, TgS Fifty-eighth street. has
naught to add to her first narrative.
Though she awaits the course of the
iaw the police work.
Upon the dead husband's mother
falls the brunt of blame for thÂ« trag
edy. From the lips of the wife, from
her parents, her brothers and her sis
ters, come the words of censure for
feeble old woman. She It was
that broke in upon the harmony of
the little home and made discord
which drove love out and mocked
marriage vows so newly made. But
the Dolice believe there is another
side to the steer. It is '.'r.is side that
the detectives are working on.
Despite this effort of the police the
clear declaration of the young wife
that she only shot to save her life
stands uncontradicted. Can the po
lice break it down?
DID KOEHX FEAR?
Did young Koehn fear that trouble
was brewing? His actions for sev
eral days before the fatal meeting
yesterday morning give Detectives
Kyle and Quigley art idea that the
husband was preparing to leave the
neighborhood because of intimations
in that direction. The wife is silent.
John Paganetto. her father, refused
to-day to talk to the detectives on
that line. Charles Kruger, a friend
and neighbor of the Koehns, knows
what were the young man's reasons
for suddenly breaking up the home-
So does Attorney C. F. Solomonson
of San Francisco. But Kruger tells
the police this:
I talked with Koehn Friday night after bis
wife &me to our boose, taring her husband
bad threatened her with harm. Pagasetto and
I went to see Mm. The gtrT* father !eft me
alone with Koehn and we had a tscg talk.
What he said to me I sfaa!! net repeat until I
go on tae witness rtasd. .
Friday afternoon Koehn went to At
torney Solomonson and related his
story to the lawyer, pleading that he
desired to get a divorce. Attorney Sol
omonson refuses to tell what Koehn
imparted on the ground that to repeat
the conversation would be a breach of
professional ethics. But Solomonson
did admit to the detectives * that he
had 'advised Koehn to move away from
the neighborhood, |to * get g away from
bis wife's relatives, and to take' his
wife with him. ' The attorney said he
told Koehn that he did not think there
was sufficient ground for a suit for
divorce, - but the lawyer urged that
the ' husband leave that j home, for it
was too near the Paganettos.
MOTHER-IN-LAW LEAVES. -
Two days before that occurrence the
aged mother departed, going to 448
Clementina street, San Francisco. The
day ! she left it had been decided that
her son was to take some steps to
settle matters In the disturbed home.
It was upon the advice of Mrs. Krnger
that the old lady went away. And here
the detectives hint they might produce
witnesses to prove that ugly threats
against the husband had been circu
lated in the neighborhood. \
Suppose that we can show that
: Mrs. Koehn. the wife, herself had made
threats In the presence of several per
sons?" asked the detectives.
'Suppose -we can show that Mrs.
Koehn has contradicted herself In . re- !
gard to finding the pistol so convenient
ly at hand in the bed?" they query.
These are the only suggestions they
will throw out as to their possible line
of action in the case.
The prisoner says:
My conscience does cot : disturb ma. I shot
tat saU-def More than this I will not sajr.
Judge Frick. my attorney, has counseled me
to â .Â«vÂ» no statement.
Mrs. Louisa Pagacetto, the other
mother-in-law, adds:
"We had tried to -fix up the difference*, . but
Â«mJd dÂ» nothing, as Mrs. Koehn, the oM lady,
was broad to stick by her sea in everything.
HUSBAND DEJECTED.
; After the meeting with Attorney Sol- j
omonson Friday Koehn went home and,
according to his wife, was dejected and :
out of sorts. :He wrote a long letter, j
The police cannot trace \ it. \ Afterward
Koehn and \ the young woman quar
reled, and It was then. that she left the ;
bouse, going across the street to the
Krugers'. Koehn had made up his mind \
to follow his attorney's advice, at least
so ' far as â  his 7 departure % from ; Fifty- \
eighth street was concerned. That was"
settled to-day, when a "Wilson Bros. I
Moving Company's van ," from San
Francisco stopped at the residence, the
driver declaring;. that he had \ received i
an order Saturday : from Koebn and his i
mother to go there this morning and j
move the household goods to San Fran
cisco. The teamster had not learned of
his customer's - death until he arrived I
on the scene this morning. He returned j
to San Francisco f empty-handed, the j
house : and its belongings -. being in .-, the '
Coroner's charge. i-^-', -,//i. 'â '/; ; v ;-' â â  ,--'. : . L ,'
Out of to-day's developments , the de- j
tectlves draw \ the possible offset to the '
widow's plea of self-defense that anger '
over j her husband's determination vto )
leave her, almost before the honeymoon!

had seen Bailey meet the girl at Fourth
and Franklin streets. When he asked
the girl where she was going Bailey In
terfered, telling her not to answer.
Curnniers aJso said that he saw Bailey
give the girt a 15 sold piece. At the
depot Curnniers told Leontme that she
had better go back home, but she re
fused and he returned and later re
ported the matter to Gere.
The father of the girl says he has
evidence incriminating Bailey: that the
child had. run away twice, two years
ago, and had been in a convent to San
Francisco. He says Bailey's wife has
complained to him about her husband's
non-support and undue familiarity
with the child.

Thomas "Earl of Pawtucket"
a "Biahsted Englishman"
fIEV COMEDY SETS COLUMBIA fl-GRIN
"I implored Mr. Thomas," said Law
is nee D'Orsay last evening in his lit
ile speech, "not to make a "silly ass*
*â >Â£ me in "The Earl of Pawtucket.*
D'Orsay/ said Mr. Thomas, 'I'll make
you exactly what you are yourself* â
and here I am." concluded Mr. D'Orsay.
He was certainly "there" last night
at the Columbia with "The Earl of
I 'aw tucket." The D'Orsay personality
in the Earl of Cardington, alias Mont
gomery PAnam, was as deliciously and
puagently in evidence as it was in the
actor's one-worded part in "The Only
Way"â and who can forget the lovely,
l>2o\vn-in-the-bottle "blahsted" Eng
liÃhnesa of his condemned French aris
lucrat: It would in fact take much
more than "Gus" Thomas to make any
thing else but himself of Lawrance
D'Orsay. Nothing short of a guillotine
would effect itâ and the pity on't when
cior.e! One rather wondered if there
enough of Mr. D'Orsay to go
sound a whole play. The moments we
have had of him. as the King in "A
Hoj^il Family," as the "alluring" man
in A The Gay LordQuex," and in a
email part or two besides, were unfail
mgly delightful. But they were small
parts comparatively, small and in
tensely similar. So is the Earl of Card
-i.gtoi:âonly more so. It is
the generous, stupid, chivalrous, aris
tocratic Britisher in three acts, and
there Is not a word too many of him.
One is not surprised that "The Earl
of Pawtucket" kept New York a-grin
for a year even in the hot season,
when to grin is hard labor. It kept
the audience in queer little spasmodic
convulsions last night all through.
sudden and tardy snickers, great
laughs and little laughs as the leisure
ly humor sunk in.
Mr. Thomas has planted Mr. D*Or
6ay*a kind of Englishman down in
New York at the Waldorf-Astoria.
The hero is an English Earl. Card
s:iÃion. who has left England to es
rape being a witness at a trial and
also to follow a beautiful American
girl with whom he has fallen in love.
An American friend of his In London
has lent ;ngton his name, Mont
gomery Putnam. The girl happens to
be Putnam's divorced wife, who has.
however, resumed her maiden name.
But Cardington Is Introduced to her
as "Montgomery Putnam" and . the
fun begins.
Besides Cardington. there are sev
eral other cleanly dra- n figures in the
piece, and the complex situations and
complications are both entertaining
and original. But Cardhigton's the
thing. The Earl, with his delicious at
tempts at Americanism, his constant
fund of amazement for the thing
American, his chivalry. his leis
urely, lovely unhumorousness, is the
< enter of things. Mr. D'Orsay is most
happy in the part. He wetrs its won
drous vests with the air of a thousand
kings. His drawl will be epidemic
within the weekâ one heard half the
people going out grinning that they
had a- telegram from "Aunt Sara-ah,
<inn't-cher know?" And, above all. the
little mannerisms, stupidity, unhumor
Â«.-u.Â«ness forgotten, the figure is that of
a fine, sweet gentleman, as ably drawn
by the playwright as it is handsomely
pictured by the actor.
The company assisting Is excellent.
Th^re is not a smack of staginess
Throughout the cast. Perhaps Miss
Peyton's spinster aunt is the most
aggressively comical figure, though no
more realistic than the admirable wait
ers that help things out so welL
Charles Hallock. Herbert Fortier and
A. P. Thomas as Mr. Fordyce, Senator
-Barker and Silas Hooper are a trio
of business men that might have
walked in off Montgomery street, and
ICrnest Elton is equally realistic as the
valet.
Miss Florence Robinson as Harriet
Fordyce also brings much charm of
naturalness and grace to the role, and
Mary Elizabeth Forbes Is winsome in
the ingenue role of Ella Seaford. An
excellent play, an excellent company
and an excellent star.
BLANCHE PARTTNGTON.
Central Theater.
The Central Theater stock company
opened the week last evening with
"The Night Before Christmas." This
is a drama in which a father In his ca
pacity of Judge Is compelled to pass
the death sentence upon his own son
and, subsequently, as Governor, to re
fuse to stay the death penalty, al
though his wife, his own mother and
the son's sweetheart appeal to him.
With this basis for pathos the stock
company succeeded In drawing tears.
Mayall was the hero, Jack Phillips.
and Henry Ehumer was the Judge.
Juliet Crosby was the sweetheart, Ma
t-ion Williams, and Edna Ellsmere the
mother of the condemned man. The
favor of the audience went largely to
James Conrfgan as Daniel Webster

trial scene was made much of. The
performance was an all-around suc

SMART SET AT TTVOLJ
To HEAR "THE LIARS"
Swellest Audience Ever Gathered In
the Tivoll Opera-House Greets
Clever Amateurs.
Last night the Tivoli and the smart
set. for the first time, got on an inti
mate footing, for "The Liars" did for
the playhouse what even grand opera
had failed to do: to summon the
"people who belong." And in truth
do they fit amazingly into the white
and gold setting, these women in
white and pink and blue, befeathered
and bejeweled. The men? They, too,
were smart. Ah! it was a sight, that
house last night, when a dozen and
three amateurs presented for the sec
ond time (this time for the Polyclinic)
Henry Arthur Jones' snappy comedy,
â¢The Liars." with Francis L. Mathicu
looking after the stage business.
The cast was as before,' save ' in
quality of work, which was improved,
and was as follows:

In the former production I feared
for the immunity of Dr. J. "Wilson
Shiels from an avalanche of "mash
notes," so splendid a lover did he
make, and such a philosopher for the
other fellow. Such lovers as he are a
menace to the peace of mind of many
maidens, even from behind the foot
lights. But when it was discovered
that he was making such adorable
love to his own wife he became a
hero, nothing less.
Thomas B. Eastland, Lloyd
Lowndes, William H. Smith Jr., Roy
den Williamson, In fact, the whole
male cast were finished in their
methods, giving promise of clever
things in the days to come.
As for the feminine work, Miss Jol
liffe plucked new honors. Whether or
not it was the "atmosphere" of a night
production. Miss Jolliffe was certainly
more natural and Â» altogether more
charming than in the first presenta
tion, which was assuredly mighty
clever. ,
Mrs. Mark Gerstle, whose histrionic
reputation has spread abroad, played
uj. to her reputation, as did the rest
of the cast â such as had one.
During the first and second acts
Signor Glorgano Polaoco conducted
his orchestra, producing: "Airs de !
Danse" "Lakme" â (a) "Terana," (b) 'â 
"Rektah," (c) "Persian and Finale"
(Delibes); overture, from "Mignon"
(Thomas).
It was with the latter number that
the sensitive young Italian drew from
the 'audience a tumultuous response,
to which he smiled his thanks, bowed
lew and accepted a wreath of posies.
The rest of the music was well con
ducted by Theodore Â»Vogt, as follows:
Overture, "Merry Wives of Windsor"
(Otto Xlcolai); (a) "Serenade," first
time (Hans Winderstein), (b) intro- ;
duction to the second act from "Prince
Asmodeus," first time (Theodore
Vogt); march, "Tannhauser" (Wag
ner).
The play, the actors, the house and
the cause â all were roundly toasted
at the multiplicity of suppers that fol
lcwed in the cafes.
"The Liars" had scored again!

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, FEBRUARY U, 1905.
NEW MEXICO'S
HOPES DASHED
House Members Determined
to Reject the State
hood Bill as Amended
SIGNING AN AGREEMENT
Republicans Pledge Their
Adherence to Programme
Merging the Territories
WASHINGTON, Feb. 13. â The Re
publican leaders of the House to-day
took the first step toward getting the
statehood bill into conference. In
accordance with the plan previously
decided upon Delegates Rodey and
McGuire of New Mexico and Okla
homa respectively began the circula
tion of a paper among the Republican
members for signatures. At the head
of this paper is the following state
ment:
In the endeavor of the House to secure the
final passage of H. B. 14.749 and the admis
sion at Oklahoma and Indiap Territory as one
State and ihe Territories of New Mexico and
Arizona as one State by conference between
the two houses, or otherwise, the undersigned
members of the House will support the parlia
mentary procedure deemed necessary for that
purpose by the Committee on Territories, the
Committee on Rules or any conference com
mittee.
It is deemed necessary to obtain
only the signatures of the thirty
three Republicans who voted against
the resolution adopted, expressing
practically the same idea. It is stated
that this can readily be done. The
n^xt steD will be the introduction of
the necessary rule in the form of a
resolution which will provide that the
statehood bill shall be taken from the
Committee on Territories and sent to
the conference without action by the
committee or opportunity for a mo
tion to concur in the Senate amend
ments.
This activity on the part of those
interested in getting the bill through
is taken to indicate confidence that
the Senate ultimately will yield to the
House provisions. In this connection
it is understood that the House is
willing to accept the amendment of
fered in the Senate which permits
Arizona and New Mexico to vote sep
arately on the question of statehood.
Should either of these Territories re
ject the proposition the provision for
one State out of the Territories of
Arizona and New Mexico would faM,
but the union and admission of Okla^
homa and Indian Territory would be
obtained.
SANTA FE. N. M., Feb. 13.â

The ConirrÂ«sÃionÂ«l Record Â«f the Tth Instant
rontalns these words, uttered on the floor of
the Senate by you: "To-day polygamy exists
In New Mexico. It has been declared that It
is a breeding irround of polygamy. If this
Territory Is not admitted these violators of
law will b^Â» brought to Justice."
I challenge the truth of the above utterance
and Will put up $1000 to be turned over to
any charitable organization you may name If
you furnish the names of ten men in this Ter

hear from yon.
On January 1. 1905, there were 638
adult Mormons in the Territory and
the records of the United States
(Courts in New Mexico do not show a
single case of any Mormon of this
Territory having ever been Indicted
for polygamy.
LEITER HAS
FIGHT WITH
A WILDCAT
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHEYENNE, Wyo., Feb. 18. â JoÂ©
Leiter of Chicago had an encounter
with a wildcat in Northern Wyoming
a few days ago, the details of which
reached Cheyenne to-day in a letter
from a member of the hunting party
to a friend.
Leiter and a companion discovered a
large bob cat in the branches of a dead
tree and were circling around to get a
shot at the animal. Leiter crept in
under the branches of the tree to get a
good shot when the tree suddenly col
lapsed bringing the dead branches and
the bob cat down upon the intrepid
hunter.
Leiter was thrown to the ground. He
arose to discover that the wildcat was
about to spring. Having lost his gun
he grabbed a club and attacked tha
beast. A fierce struggle ensued during
which the Chicago stock speculator
was badly scratched, but he succeeded
in killing the animal.

WILL REDUCE
THE EXPENSE
OF WIRELESS
FORMER NAVAL APPRENTICE
WHO HAS INSTALLED CHEAP
WIRELESS ON THT3 MARION.
J. S. Yokela's Re
ceiver Cost
Only $2.
The receiving apparatus of the wire
less telegraph system on the battleship
Ohio cost Uncle Sam in the neighbor
hood of $500. It was mada by scientific
men in a scientific way; is extremely
delicate, very complicated and alto
gether in keeping with the deep, dark
mystery which, to tha lay mind, BtiU
envelops this latest means of long
distance communication. On board tha
naval militia training ship Marion,
moored at FolÃom-Btreet wharf, is a
little handful of hardware worth about
$2, by means of which a youngster, for
merly an apprentice in the navy, is
able to overhear all the wireless con
versations going on within a radius of
a hundred miles.
This young inventor, who thinks ho
is on the road to a great reduction in
the cost of the wireless telegraphic ap
paratus, is John S. Yokela of 243 Steu
art street. He is 22 years old. He
served Uncle Sam for seven years as a
naval apprentice, leaving the service
with a good discharge about four
months ago. While in the navy he
showed a liking for electrical work and
was assigned for duty where his bent
could have full swing. He made good
use of his opportunities and was elec
trician on the Boston when the wireless
system was Installed on that vessel
about two years ago. He learned the
Morse alphabet, studied the mysteries
of atmospheric waves and when he left
the Boston carried away a letter in
forming all concerned that J. S. Yokela
was a wireless expert and a first-class
operator.
After leaving the navy young Yokela
kept alive his Interest in wireltss af
fairs. A few days ago he got permiss-
Bion to string a wire to the truck of
the Marion's mainmast. He sent the
wire aloft by the signal halyards and
secured the lower end to the bulwarks.
He intends to patent his receiver and
will give no details of how he makes
his wire tell him what it hears be
yond saying that the only part of his
apparatus he bought was a telephone
receiver and that the whole outfit
'.vould not cost $2. He has had his re
ceiver working during the last two
trips of the Ohio and had no difficulty
in catching every dot and dash from
tht time the Ohio was seventy miles at
sea until she entered the harbor.
"My receiver," Yokela said yesterday,
"is much -more satisfactory than the one
they have on the Boston and, I think,
would be serviceable at a much greater
distance. I am not quite ready to apply
for a patent or I should be pleased to
show you just how simple an affair
it is."
Two darning needles, some carbon,
about a hundred feet of wire and his
telephone receiver, say the people on
the Marion, are the component parts
of the Yokel* wireless receiver.
EQUITABLE WAR
TO OPEN TO-DAY
flpedal Dispatch to TkÂ« Call.
NEW YORK, Feb. 13.â Every person
In the financial world was greatly in
terested in the report that an effort
Is being made to change the Equitable
Life Assurance Society from an or
dinary stock corporation into a mutual
concern, in which every policyholder
would have a right to vote. The im
portance of the change is manifest as
the company's assets are now placed
at $513,953,000 and the investment of
this enormous sum depends almost
v/holly upon those in control.
James H. Hyde, whose father found
ed the company, is now in a position
to dictate the Equitable's policy, as he,
v.'ith his mother and sister, has 51 per
cent of the capital stock. The shares
held by him and his immediate family,
of a par value of only $51,000, sway the
great business of the assurance com
pany and there Is said to be a strong
combination to effect a change in the
present situation. There will be a
meeting to-morrow that will attract
the directors, who are now scattered
all over the country, and they will
then discuss the desirability of trans
formfcig the Equitable into a mutual
company on a plane with very many
of the other great insurance corpora
tions.
That there has been a difference of
opinion' on the part of the directors is
admitted by all concerned, but all are
too conservative to admit that there
is any prospect of a serious split in
the business. Jacob H. Schiff, one of
the trustees of the company, said:
"The matter is now before the board
of trustees. It is a very delicate ques
tion and concerns such vast interests
among the policybolders and others

Are Shown to the Jurymen
Special Dispatch to The Call.
AUBURN, Feb. 13.â The prosecution
of Adolph Weber, accused of the mur
der of his mother, Mary Weber, was
practically ended to-day. At 4:45 when
the court adjourned the prosecu
tion's testimony was In. Judge
Prewett, however, will allow the
prosecution to bring in any wit
ness at the session to-morrow morn
ing that in their conference to-night
they may decide on. To-day's sessions
were devoted to the reading of the
statements made by Adolph Weber at
the Coroner's inquest and the state
ments made to Sheriff Keena by Weber
the day after the tragedy.
When General Webb proposed to of
fer in evidence the statement made by
Weber in the Sheriff's office the day
after the fire, Attorney Johnson for the
defense made a strong objection on the :
ground that at that time Weber was !
under duress. The statement, how
ever, was admitted.
Attorney Tabor testified that the
morning after the fire hÂ© had gone to
the Sheriff's office. The door was
locked and Weber was inside talking
to the Sheriff. Tabor stated that ha
kicked on the door until Sheriff Keena
finally admitted him. Tabor's demand
for admission was based on his right
as an executor of the will made by
Julius Weber several years ago, and j
also on the ground that he had been I
Julius Weber's attorney for several i
years. The will ha referred to has
never been found.
GUARDIAN" TESTIFIESL
John Adams, guardian of Adolph I
Weber, testified that he was present at
the time Attorney Tabor kicked on tho
Sheriff's door. He substantiated Ta
bor's statement in every respect.
Howard* Carr, the gun expert from '
San Francisco, testified that yesterday
he had gone into the woods and fired
a number of shots from a new revolver.
Ho had shown the bullets he had used
in his experiment. They are clear cut
and without blemishes, when com- I
pared with the bullets he had used in
experiments with the weapon found in
the Weber barn. The bullets found in j
the bodies of the Webers, the bullets i
that Carr used in experiments with the
revolver found in the Weber barn, and
the bullets with which hÂ© experimented
yesterday were all shown t> the jury
to-day and were carefully scrutinized
by that body.
J. D. Gray, the telegraph operator
at Zeta station, testified that on the
night of the tragedy the Colfax local
train, known as No. 34, left that sta
tion bound for Auburn at 6:38. This
testimony was introduced to substan
tiate the evidence of May Clark of
Brewery lane, who swore that Adolph
Weber passed her house about that
time on his way down town, thus con- I
tradicting Weber's statement that :
when he left his house on the night of
the tragedy he had not gone down
Brewery lane, but had taken a round
about way down College lane and past I
the James house.
BLOOD ON CLOTHES.
Dr. White identified the clothes and !
undergarments worn by the defendant
on the night of the tragedy. Dr. White
said. he found blood stains on the left
and right sleeves of Weber's coat and
clots of blood on the back of the
sleeves, and that there were large
Btalns on the front of the trousers.
The defendant looked serious during
both sessions of the court to-day. He â 
seemed tired and at times his face bore i
a worried expression. Books and news- j
papers that formerly interested him in I
court had no interest for him to-day !
He listened attentively to what the '
witnesses had to say, showing particu
lar concern during the reading of the
testimony he had given at the Coro
ner's inquest. At the close of court
this afternoon he Joined his attorneys
in consultation. He said but little to
them, but was greatly interested in all
they said. The defiant air which has
marked his appearance during the trial
to-day gave way to a milder expres
sion.
George Ruth, whose testimony thÂ©
defense will endeavor to Impeach said
this afternoon to a Call representative
"l gave my testimony regarding my
connection with the tragedy as truth
fully as a man could. I told only what
I thought and knew to be absolutely
true. The decision in the case is noth
ing to me. I only want to see Justice
done. My story about helping to carry
the bodies from the Weber house is ab
solutely true. I was quite conscious
of what I was doing at that time."
Court will convene again at 9 o'clock
to-morrow morning and if the prosecu
tion at that time produces no wit
nesses the defense will immediately
take up the case."

MAYOR AND COUNCILMEN
AT WAR IN CLEVELAND
Charges Made by the Chief Executive
of the City Result in a
Fiery Session.
CLEVELAND, Feb. 13. â To-nlght'a
session of the City Council was one of
the most exciting that body ever held.
The Republicans took up Mayor John
son's recent statement that he be
lieved their votes on the question of
annexing the village of South Brook
lyn to the city of Cleveland had been
unduly influenced. Councilman Halle,
a Republican, said with much anger
that if the Mayor included him among
those whose votes had been so influ
enced the Mayor was a lair.
Councilman Homer intimated that
Mayor Johnson had, when he was a
street railway owner, influenced the
votes of Councllmen to obtain desired
privileges. The Mayor retorted that
no man dared face him with a def
inite charge to that effect
A resolution was introduced and re
ferred to the judiciary committee to
expel all persons from the Council
floor except members of the Council,
newspaper men and heads of city de
partments. This resolution would ex
clude the Mayor from the privilege
which he now has of a seat In the

ELLIS REFUSES
TO BE WITNESS
Denies Authority of Police
Board to Compel Him to
Testify Against Himself
NO DECISION REACHED
Sergeant Christiansen Says
He Did Not Give Tip and
Defendant Exonerates Rim
The trial of Sergeant Ellis dragged
before the Police Commission last
night and adjournment was taken to
Wednesday evening. The question to
be settled then is whether thÂ« board
can compel Ellis to take the stand.
The Commissioners axe eager to hear
the confession he made to the Grand
Jury. He refused last night to testi
fy voluntarily.
Sergeant H. H. Christiansen wu thÂ»
most interesting witness. He waa
asked if it were true, as the Grand
Jury's version of Ellis' confession
reads that hÂ«e told the accused aer
geant to go to Chan Cheung for thÂ»
weekly payment from the "sack."
Christiansen pronounced the state
ment false. Attorney Mogan arose on
behalf of Ellis and said the defend
ant had made no statement implicat
ing Christiansen.
The witness explained that he wan
in command of the Chinatown squad
for nine months before Ellis took
charge. After waging a campaign for
three weeks his hands were tied by
an injunction. While he was free to
make raids .he did not succeed in
stopping gambling altogether. "I
don't think any man can stop tha
gambling altogether," said the ser
geant.
"Do you think you could find any
gambling in Chinatown now?" queried
Commissioner Reagan.
"I don't think I could," waa thÂ© an
rwer.
I thought you said the game*
could not be stopped." commented
Reagan. Commissioner Drlnkhouse
here began another question and the
sergeant did not hayÂ© an opportunity
to explain.
Thirty-six Chinatown guides wÂ«r*
called to testify as to gambling In
Chinatown, but they were surprisingly
ignorant of any lawbreakingf. As th*
commission controls their licenses
there may be trouble ahead.
Four of the eight Chinese "states
men" defied the aubpenas of the board.
Attachments were issued to have them
brought In Wednesday evening. ThÂ«
effort to call the president of the Se*
Tups resulted in the appearance of a
cannery foreman. There was confu
sion of identity and Sergeant Cook Is
to hunt out the real president and
have him bring the books of thÂ« or
ganization to-morrow night.

drawn up on even terms with Misty's

l>Â»y horse, it looked as if she was best.
The winner was second clicrice in the
betting.
An attractive card .and splendid
weather brought out a large crowd,
and the twenty-five bookmakers had
no time for loafing. Three choices were
successful, and the long shot players
were in clover when Andvari landed.
Andvari, a 25 to 1 shot, ridden by
â¢"Big Bill" Knapp, took the first event
In a drive from Alone. Grenore, an
other long priced one. led to the pad
dock and then finished third. Princess
Zulu, the favorite, quit In the stretch,
and Miller's Daughter failed to display
ppeed at any stage of the running.
Harvester II was sore and made a dis
appointing showing.
Thirteen started in the six-furlong
selling sprint, which followed. Cousin
Carrie, the 3 to 1 favorite, had all the
of the party and won all the way.
From a slow beginning Hulford skirted
the big hunch, beating Adirondack a
neck for the place. Sterling Towers,
Ktanchly backed for the show, ran fifth.
On his preceding race The Fretter
looked to outclass tfie starters' in the
im!e and fifty yard number. The books
laid plenty of 3 to 1 about the O'Rourke

he won by four lengths from Tann

In the concluding six and a half fur

CASEY USES HIS LEFT
ON TOMMY WEST'S JAW
Big Irishman Is Getting Ready to
Box Sam Berger Next Fri
day Night.
James Casey, the lengthy sailor
man, who came so dangerously near
beating Sam Berger a couple of
months ago, springs a new surprise
every day. It was Tommy West who
had the joke played on him yesterday.
Tommy is prÂ«tty well able to care for
h'mself under all circumstances, hav
ing boxed the best middleweights in
the country and he consented to an
impromptu bout when asked to put
on the gloves. To find a fast chap
with a lightning left was West's valen
tine. Casey showed a left jab that
will be a revelation to those who saw
him perform before and it was West's
opinion that he had struck a really
intelligent boxer, one who had the
brain to learn things and the capacity
to pick up the fine points when prop
erly taught
Berger pleaded lack of condition
when he fought Casey before; said he
undestlmated the big Irishman and
did not work as he should. He will
have no excuses to offer next Friday
night, when they furnish the wind-up
to the San Francisco Club's four
rcund exhibition. He has been in *ight
training for several weeks and Is now
putting in the hard strokes with
Jimmy Britt as chief adviser.
BIRDS WILL BE FACTORS
AT COMING EXPOSITION
Plans for Forest, Fish and Game
Show Are Rapidly Being
Formed.
Dr. p. w. d'Evelyn, chairman of the
cemmittee on birds In the coming ex
hibition of the Forest, Fish and Game
Association, is a great enthusiast on
the feathered tribe. In fact all the
committee heads are enthusiasts on
the special branch under their care
and in that seems to lie the enormous
success of the enterprise. Dr. d'Evelyn
goes so far as to insist that ornithology
should be included in educational
courses from the grammar schools to
the colleges. He will appreciate the
co-operation of people in all parts of
the country for his bird section and
will gladly accept such specimens as
may be offered, whether live or
mounted, and guarantees safe return
ol all loan exhibits.
The most satisfactory progress is re
ported in every department and the
energetic handling of the affair, from
President William Greer Harrison
right through the list, makes a divert
ing exhibition appear sure. Letters
were received yesterday from Presi
dent W. H. Goode of the Lewis and
Clark Exposition at Portland and R. F.
.Green, Chief Commissioner of Lands
and Works in British Columbia, offer
ing assistance in the matter of ex
hibits.

unusual probate proceeding to-day.
About fifteen years ago a Mr. and
Mrs. Rushforth came to California
from England, bringing with them
Mrs. Rushforth's mother, Mrs. Rams
den. Mrs. Ramsden's husband re
mained in England. There is a pe
culiar English law which provides
that if a man or woman has not
heard from his wife or her husband
for seven years, he or she is free to
remarry again, the absent one be
ing presumed by law to be dead. Al
though Ramsden knew that his wife
was still living in California he took
advantage of the law and again mar
ried.
About two years ago Mrs. Rush
forth s mother, the original Mrs.
Ramsden, died In this city. She left
quite a large estate. Mrs. Rushforth
was the only child. When the estate
came into court the claim was made
that the husband in England was
heir.
Judge Smith held that Ramsden
could not share in the estate.
PASTORS OF SAN JOSE
DISLIKE SUNDAY FUNERALS
Ministers' Union Makes Strange Rule
to Govern Burials at Which
They Officiate.
BAN JOSE, Feb. 13.â The pastors of
this city object to Sunday funerals.
They also want a carriage for their
own use at the funeral, would ride at
the head as a sort of grand marshal
and demand that the family and rela
tives leave the grave before the earth
is thrown upon the casket This new
code of ethics to govern funerals was
reported to the meeting of the Pastors'
Union this morning by a committee
appointed for such a purpose. The re
port included the following resolu
tions, which were adopted unanimous
ly by the union:
The pastors of the city ot Ban Jose, desiring
to promote the reverent simplicity and dignity
of funeral arrangements, beg leave to offer the
following BUg-gestons :
That In the event of death occurring In any
family, tha clergyman, undertaker and super
intendent of the cemetery be consulted with
reference to the time for the funeral services
That except in cases of extreme necessity
funerals should not be appointed for Sundays
That where the circumstances of the be^
reaved family permit a carriage be placed at
the disposal of the officiating clergyman, to
be used by him alone, and that this carriaxa
precede the funeral precession.
That in conformity with the reverent custom
now almost universal the funeral servWs
shall close with the committal service benedic
tion at the grave, and that the relatives and
friends return to their homes before the filling
of the grave. â¢*â¢Â»"â¢
INDIAN IS HELD OVER
TO SUPERIOR COURT
Redskin Who Recently Killed Wil
lows Rancher Will Be Tried
on Murder Charge.
WILLOWS, Feb. 13.â Wesley Him
bogardy, the Indian charged with the
murder of A. J. Ketchum, a pioneer
j was bound over to-day to the Superior
' Court. His bonds were fixed at
I $10,000. Very damaging evidence was
j brought out at the preliminary hear-
I ing of the accused. The officer who
arrested him testified that the Indian
expressed himself as being sorry that
his victim had- a chance to recover, as
he had shot to kill. The fact that the
deceased carried a loaded shotgun
gives the defense a working plea and
they will set up the plea that the
Indian was forced to shoot in order to
save his own life.

GANS PINES
FOR A FIGHT
Al Herford Deposits $5000
With Sporting Editor of
The Call to Bind Match
PBEFEKS JIMMY BRITT
If Califomian Will Not Go
Bark Man Is Willing to
Take on Any Lightweight
Joe Gans has loomed up plainly In
the pugilistic horizon once more. He {
pines for a match with Jimmy Britt,
Battling Nelson or any one else who is
willing to take a chance. Last night
Al Herford, the black demons man- I
ager, posted a forfeit of JSOOO with the
sporting editor of The Caii to bind a.
match with any man who wants to
fight him.
Herford explains how he came out
here with Gans for the purpose of
meeting Jimmy Gardner a month ago
and that the match did not come
through owing to several differences.
Since that time, Herford adds, he has
been waiting and watching for an op
portunity to match his champion
against some worthy boxer, but his ef
forts have been unsuccessful.
Herford is willing to pit his man
against any of them at 133 pounds at
6 o'clock or 134 pounds ringside. He is
also willing to let the $5000 forfeit go
as a side bet, as a whole or to be sub
divided as the other fellow wishea.
Nothing is said about a referee in the
sweeping challenge, but it Is likely
that Herford will not be too strict on
this point inasmuch as he has made
the offer so strong.
Herford admits that he is after Britt,
but if the Native Son cannot be land
ed he will take Willie Lewis, Battling
Nelson or Jimmy Gardner. No reply
has yet been received by Herford. but
it is expected that the challenge will
create some little excitement when the
others hear about it.
Nelson and Corbett are at work get
ting into condition for their coming
fight. It looks as though the Battling
one will have all the trouble making
the weight this time. He now weighs
140 pounds and is doing all kinds of
road work trying to take some of It off.
Joe Gans is helping Corbett get Into
form at San Rafael and the little
featherweight never worked harder in
his life. All his friends say he will
beat the Great Dane this time and are
going to bet on him. Oorbett is about
down to weight now, but he will keep
going for a while, bo that he will be
fully prepared to weather the storm of
many a hard round with Nelson.
GARDEN CITY
SUES FOR COIN
Begins Action to Kecover
$9827 07 Lost During Term
of Treasurer McGeoghegan
Sj>eciai Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, Feb. 13.â The suit of the
city of San Jose against the United
States Fidelity and Guaranty Company
to recover $9827 07, alleged to have been
misappropriated by Thomas J. Mc-
Geoghegan while serving as City Treas
urer, began this afternoon before Judge
Welch in the Superior Court. It is
claimed by the city that McGeoghegan
took this money between the first Mon
day in July, 1902, and the Bth day of
March, 1903. The bonding company,
with the American Bonding Company
of Baltimore, was on the Treasurer's
bond in the sum of $50,000 each. John E.
Richards, assisted by City Attorney
Brown, represents the city, E. E. Coth
ran appears for McGeoghegan and
Thomas, Gerstle & Frick of San Fran
cisco appear for the bonding compa
nies. The American Bonding Company
has also been sued.
Ex-Mayor Charles J. Martin and Dep
uty City Clerk Charles J. Lightston
were the only witnesses examined this
afternoon. They identified some papers
and records of the city.
The case promises to be a hard
fought one. McGeoghegan was tried on
the charge of embezzling the money
and the jury decided that he was not
guilty. Both bonding companies axe
trying to evade the responsibility for
the shortage on the ground that Mc-
Geoghegan's shortage should have been
reported earlier and that city officials
were lax In their methods, or ouch a
large shortage could not have occurred.

I had boils ranging from five to twenty in

I 'a nama Steamer Loses Seven
Days on Coast and Will
Not Be Here for a Week
The best news received in many
days by the shipping community of
the Pacific Coast was the reported
sailing yesterday from Staten Island
of two lightships for service off the
shores of California. Appropriations
for aids to navigation are sometimes
not so liberal as conditions demand
and these two lightships will, in every
sense of the trite expression, fill long
f^lt wants. The lightships are known
officially by numbers and Nos. S3 and
S6 are the new floating beacons that
are comins here to assist No. 70. now
stationed on the bar, in the work of
puiding mariners safely into port.

Tho Call has repeatedly called at
tention to the necessity for a relief
boat. Charts and other aids to navi
gation tell the mariner that on such
â  place on the bar swings a lightship.
From that lightship in hazy weather
the navigator can get his bearings
;Â»nd make port in safety. Lightships,
like all other floating property, re
quire overhauling at regular intervals
and this work cannot be done without
bringing them into port and placing
them in dry-dock. When No. 70 has
been brought in a gas buoy has been
installed in her place. To mariners
that knew of the substitution this was
all right, but the change was apt to
be misleading to vessels coming in
from long voyages without notice of
any rh.inge and on the lookout for a
lig;htÂ£hij>. That no serious accidents
occurred is a tribute to the care with
which the navigators performed their
duties.

sleep shortly before midnight Sunday
by an intruder. As soon as the
stranger became aware that the oc
cupant was aroused he hastily left,
with McLaren in pursuit The strang
er, as he ran through the hall,
knocked a table down, which McLaren
fell over. By the time McLaren had
recovered himself the stranger had
made his way to the street. McLaren
continued the chase and ran down
stairs. The first man he met was Wil
liam Henrick, who lives at 525 Larkin

leased.

COMPLAIN THAT
FOOD IS POOR
Hospital Employes Object
to a Daily Diet of Beans,
Corned Beef and Cabbage
TO PROBE EXPENSES
Supervisors Call on Boaxd
of Works to Explain De
pletion of Various Funds
At yesterday's meeting of the Su- (
pervisors' Finance Committee Dr. j
Ward, president of the Health Board,
presented a complaint of the internes
and nurses of the County Hospital
about the poor food served. They
averred that the daily diet, which con
sisted chiefly of 'corned beef and
cabbage, beans and hamburgr steak,"
was so bad that they were often com
pelled to leave the table without eat
ingr and 25 per cent of the nurses were
sick.
Dr. Ward said $5000 would be nee- i
essary for better food and quarters,
but the committee thought the em
ployes should, worry along as best
they could.
The Finance Committee called on !
the Board of Works to explain the
depletion of various funds under its
control, which resulted in the laying
off of large gangs of men In the pav
ing and sewer repair departments. J.
Magee headed a delegation of labor
ers who had been dismissed in an ap
| peal for relief. The committee called :
i attention to the fact that $35,000 had
â  already been expended in seven
i months out of the $50,000 appropri-
a tion for repairing busalt pavements,
a clear violation of the one-twelfth
clause of the charter.
"We desire to ascertain," said i
| Chairman Brandenstein, "whether the
money has been properly expended.
I Five gangs of civil service men have
I been dismissed and we want to know
whether they have been excluded to
j the advantage of others."
Commissioner Aigeltinger said he
would have a statement prepared
showing the expenditures out of the
paving, sewer repair and other funds,
also the work done, meti and teams
employed and dismissed and other
data, which will be gone into a.t a
special, meeting next Friday at 3
o'clock.
The Finance Committee criticized
the Health Board for alleged evasion
of the civil service provisions of the
charter. D'Ancona said that four out
of the seven employes in the food in
spection department and four of the
eight in the sanitary inspection de
partment were non-civil service mtn,
despite the fact that the appropria
tions were made for civil service em
ployes only. Dr. Ward disclaimed
any Intention of evading the civil ser-
I vice, saying that the reorganization of
the food inspection department had
! been found necessary because it was
not efficient and that it had been done
to accomplish the highest good to
citizens. The discussion ended when
Dr. Ward withdrew his request for an
additional dairy inspector. â¢
The City Attorney was asked for an
opinion as to whether resolutions au
thorizing the payment of demands and
not acted upon by the Mayor within
ten days shall be considered as ap
proved by the board under the char
ter provision. The opinion is desired
because the Mayor did not approve or
disapprove certain demands of the
Society for the Preventibn of Cruelty
to Animals, which was awarded the
contract to impound dogs to the ex
clusion of H. O. Irwin. who was ap
pointed by the "Mayor as Poundmas
ter.
The Finance Committee considered
the adoption of a resolution notifying
Auditor Baehr and other municipal
departments that in future all de
mands for wages and salaries outside
of those specifically provided for in
the charter must be presented to the
Board of Supervisors for approval.
The proposed resolution is aimed at
the Board of Works, which heretofore
has expended certain funds without
any reference to the Board of Super
visors. Action on the resolution was
postponed for one jveek.
WRONGED HUSBAND NAMES
ONE CO-RESPONDENT
George Schemer Mentions One De
stroyer of Happiness, but Says
That He Knows Another.
George Schemer, who married his
wife, Mabel Schemer, in 1888, yester
day sued for divorce on the ground of
infidelity. In his complaint he gives
a number of dates and places of the
breach of her vows and he names one
co-respondent â John Cline. There is,
however, another in the case, "John
Doe, whose real name the plaintiff
knows, but does not care to state."
The husband obtained an order of
court preventing his from draw
ing $800 on deposit at the Wells-Far
go Bank.

STRIKE OF SAILORS FEARED
IN THE PORT OF EUREKA
Strife Between Longshoremen and
Mariners May L<ead to LÂ«abor
Complications in North.
EUREKA, Feb. 13. â The war be
tween the sailors and the longshore
men of this port may result in a
strike that will tie up northern ship
ping interests. The strife is due to
the recent organization here of a
sailors' union in opposition to the
longshoremen's association. The
agent of the new organization has
made several demands on the captains
of vessels arriving in this port. They
have not been complied with, the
skippers standing by the old union.
It is said the agent has threatened to
call the sailors out on strike unless he
is recognized.

them on promissory notes.
HORSESHOEING
CAUSES A ROW
Graney *B Exclusion Results
in Defeat of Resolutions
Parceling the Contracts
LIMITS SPEED OF CARS
Supervisors Consider Ordi
nance Fixing Kate at Ten
and Eight Miles an Hour
There was a lively row at yesterday's I
meeting of tha Board of Supervisor* I
over the proposed parceling out of the j
contracts for the shoeing of the horses
of the police, hospital, Almshouse and
electricity departments, to the exclu- ,
sion 'of Edward Graney, one of the bid- I
ders. After a heated discussion lasting
three hours all the resolutions dividing
the work up among N. Morrissey, J. T.
Mooney, Norris & Lynch. J. McNeill, J. i
F. Farrell and Edward Graney, mem- ,
bers of the Master Horseshoers' Asso
ciation, at $2 50 per horse, and to Ed- I
ward Toy at $2 25 per horse, were de- j
feated. ,-'â¢'';
When the resolution awarding Ed
ward Graney a part of the horseshoe- '
ing was taken up D'Ancona said he
was opposed to it.
"You have no right to blackmail me
in your narrow-minded way," said Gra
ney. "You have jobbed me, and I can
prove it."
Supervisor Boxton said: ;_;Â»
I see that I have been flimflammed and
given the "double cross" because I stood by 'â 
Graney, In the committee to give him part of '
the work, and now it is proposed to vote this .
resolution down. I want to be treated fairly j
and I am not asking any more for Mr. Granny i
than for any others.
The defeat of the resolutions came
after separate resolutions had been I
adopted parceling the awards to Mor
rissey, Mooney, Norria & Lynch, Mc-
Neill and Farrell, and was caused by
Gallagher and Comte changing their
votes from aye to no. Gallagher was |
the only Supervisor to vote in favor of
the Graney resolution.
E. P. Troy submitted an ordinance,
which was referred to the Street Com
mittee, prohibiting the operation of i

apply to cars carrying one-half more

THE PRESIDENT AND THE SENATE.
ANOTHER issue appears between the President and the Senate.
These issues have been of frequent occurrence. That between
Andrew Johnson and the Senate was perhaps the most noted.
Kntrenched behind the tenure of office act, the Senate sought to com
pel the President to retain a member of his Cabinet after personal
and official relations between them had become impossible. When
Cleveland was President the Senate antagonized him in the matter
of removals and appointments, and he has made this a leading fea
ture in his admirable essays on the structure of government, and the
delegation and distribution of its powers.
The issue now between President Roosevelt and the Senate is
the most interesting, because of its international aspect and its pos
sible relation to the future peace of the world. In the arbitration
treaties negotiated with many foreign countries by the President, it
is provided that a dispute shall go for arbitration to the Hague Court
upon an agreement thereto by the President, entered into >vith the
other nation party to the issue.
The Senate has the clear right to amend all treaties as part or
the treaty-making power of the Government, and it has amended
these arbitration treaties by substituting the word "treaty" for
"agreement." This makes it necessary for a separate treaty to be
made and passed upon by the Senate in each arbitrable case. It is a
delicate and difficult question. With the Senate amendment the
present treaties amount only to a declaration of policy in regard to
arbitration. As each arbitrated case must depend upon a separate
Treaty, which the Senate may amend or reject, it is not plain that the
treaties make any advance at all. They set forth the nature of the
questions that may be arbitrated, but if each require a separate
treaty none at all may ever reach an arbitral court.
Behind the Senate's position is the old aversion to an executive
governmefit. Both houses of Congress have often manifested it.
They push their respective prerogatives as against each other,
and join in opposing the legislative prerogative as against the Presi
dent. This is a perfectly proper process as far as it relates to do
mestic government. The constitutional theory is that our domestic
affairs shall be closely in the hands of the representatives of the
people and of the States, in the House and the Senate. War must be
declared by Congress. When it is declared the sword is put in the
hands of the President, but Congress retains the purse. If that is
not opened the sword may not be drawn, or, if drawn, must be
sheathed. But it is also obviously the purpose of the constitution to
put international affairs in the hands of the President.
He alone may recognize a new government anywhere in the
world, by receiving its diplomatic representative. He may order
ihe flag of a consulate or legation on foreign soil defended by the
navy. He alone may use the same force in defense of the life or
liberty of a citizen, unlawfully assailed in another nation. Acting
upon this deposit of authority in external matters, President Roose
onceives a proper arbitration policy to be the making of treaties
of arbitration, which recite the arbitral issues, leaving the executive
to make the agreement in each individual case. The Senate wants a
treaty in each case.
The President is not without precedent to sustain his position.
Heretofore there have been numerous international arbitrations with
out any treaty at all. We have arbitrated with Guatemala, Peru,
Haiti and Salvador, involving a range of issues running all the
way from maltreatment of American Consuls to the spoliation of
American citizens, by a simple protocol arranged between our State
Department and the other nation concerned. These protocols have
been signed by the Secretary of State and the Ministers of the other
countries. They have set forth the arbitral issues, named the arbi
trators, the place of meeting of the court, the date and limits of the
arbitration, and under them issues have been decided and awards
paid.
The difference between these protocols and a treaty is that they
enable prompt action, are made between those familiar with all the
s, and that they do not commit the Government to any precedent.
in larger matters we have also had international arbitration by treaty,
as in the case of the Geneva arbitration of the Alabama claims, the
Bering Sea case, and the Alaskan boundary. These arbitrations are
accepted as precedents and more. They come under the judicial rule
ire decisis. and settle all cases involving similar principles and
which are on all fours in the facts.
\o\v. it will be seen that if the Senate compel every arbitration
*o he by treaty, we are committed to each result as a precedent. If it
agreement we are not so committed, but are in the same posi
tion as when the arbitration is by protocol. This is the strength of
resident's position. It leaves us independent of precedent, and
able to adapt our policy to the changing conditions of our own na
tion and of the world. We may this year arbitrate an issue that is
innocooofi in its effect upon our national life.
But changed conditions ten years hence may make it necessary
â¢rely change our position, and negative what we have affirmed.'
]f we are operating only under executive agreements this may be
wiihout imperiling us or being a cause of war. If under a
treaty it may do both. This phase of the question does not seem
to have been considered by the Senate. A treaty establishes a hard
and fast rule. An agreement leave's the question sufficiently flexible
to accommodate the flux and change of national necessity. We think
the people prefer flexibility and that they will support the views of
the President.
MARRIAGE IN COLORADO.
"* HE Englishman, George Meredith, has produced a pretty kettle
[ of matrimonial fish by his proposition for a limited contract
marriage. Kansas has taken it up, and now a Colorado states
man proposes a variation. He would have a marriage contract to
run a minimum of three and a maximum of ten years. If it hold
water over three years it must run ten. This is a sort of indeter
minate sentence to matrimony. Another characteristic Colorado va
riation is the proposition that when the contract is made it shall de
termine whether the children are to take the family name of the
father or the mother, permitting the parents, however, to make a
square divide and permit some of them to have the father's, family
name and some the" mother's.
It is not stated whether the contract lady is to retain her own
family name or take that of the contract gent during the tenure of
the contract. Naturally she will retain her own name for what it is
worth. If both parties have property the contract may pool it or
keep it separate. If pooled each is to draw down the principal at 'the
end of the contract, with such increment and profits as it may have
earned. J
The system to lack one feature. It ought to be a wajrc
contract also, by which the gent agrees to pay the lady wages and
it should naturally fix the hours of labor, with a wage and a half for
Sundays and holidays and overtime. If this thing is to be business it
should conform in all respects to business principles.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALU, TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 14. 1905.
Her Valentine
KATE M. CLEARY
"It's for me," declared little I
Miss Varina.
nISS VARINA was about to set
aside the large square box the
postman had just handed her
â with the mental decision that,
of course, it was for Laurel, when she
caug-ht sight of the superscription,
written in a bold masculine hand:
"Miss Varina Ellington."
"It's â it's for me!" gasped Miss
Varina. "A real valentine â for me!"
Miss Varina had seen her thirty
fifth summer and not unkindly winter.
But it was many a year since she had
received a valentine. The last she
could remember receiving was sent
when she was 1 9 and used to go to
singing school with Ambrose Mead.
She and Ambrose had not been for
mally engaged, but they had under
stood each other and it had been taken
for granted by both that when the
new house on the half section was fin
ished it would be as Mrs. Ambrose
Mead that Varina Ellington would en
ter the same. But, alas; a pretty city
girl came to visit in the neighborhood,
and where Is the country youth who
can resist the dazzling charms of a city
girl when she appears, starlike. in the
monotony of his rural solitude? Am
brose was attentive to Miss Thyra
Morse. Varina imperiously protested.
A lovers' quarrel followed and. the city
girl went into the new house as Mrs.
Ambrose Mead. An indifferent house
keeper and an unsympathetic wife she
proved to be. She was dead these five
years now and Ambrose, whose farm
joined Miss Varina's own, had been
getting along as best he could with
such housekeepers as he could hire.
Miss Varina's thoughts now flew
over all the town men she knew who
might have sent her this valentine.
"Xo," she decided, as her trembling
fingers fumbled with the string.
"There ain't one of them that thinks
of me."
She held up the box and rapturously
ccntemplated the glowing object be
fore her. A cottage covered with pink
roses overhung a blue satin lake. The
inevitable verse on the Inner page
read:
"My heart is thine,
If thine were mine.
Then would I know
All bliss divine!"
FASHION'S MIRROR
A charming reception and afternoon gown of smoke blue
louisine silk, trimmed with velvet yoke and ribbon bands in
a sliade darker than material. Ruffles of satin ribbon exactly
the sliade of the silk triiH the bodice. A white picture hat and
white gloves complete the whole.
"What Is it. Aunt Varina? A. valen
tine? Oh, how lovely! For me?"
A girl came eagerly forward. She
was a Very pretty girl.
"It's for me!" declared little Miss
Varina, She was suffused in blushes,
drowned in them. "You're not the
only one, I guess, who can get valen
tines!"
"For you? Of course, you're young
enough and pretty enough to get
them by the dozen! Isn't it perfectly
gorgeous? Who do you suppose sent
it â the new minister?"
"No; I don't know as I ought to
tell you. But if you look real close
you'll see there's two initials written
i just under the verse on the inside."
With an air of the most vivid inter
est Laurel lifted the rose-covered cot
tage, the blue lake, the cupids, the
violets, the hearts and the doves and
bent eagerly over the inner page. She
straightened up with a rallying cry
and a deprecating pink finger pointed
at her aunt's glowing countenance.
"Oh, Aunt Varina! I never knew
you were a flirt! 'A. M.' That's Am
brose Mead, of course. And to think
that all the time he has been vowing
Charlie must not marry until he was
26, and you've been saying you would
ignore me all the rest of my life if I
married Charlie, that his uncle and
my aunt have been carrying on this â
this lively flirtation!" She broke off
with a little despairing gesture. "I'm â
I'm really astonished at you, Aunt
Varina!"
Miss Varina, fluttered, flattered, agi
tated, clasped and unclasped her
hands in nervous ecstacy.
"But â but you're mistaken, Laurel!
Indeed you are! It was because I de
tested â yes, detested â Ambrose Mead,
that I did not want you to marry his
nephew. Why, we haven't spoken for
fifteen years â not since he married
that poor, shiftless, good-for-nothing
â there! She's dead â the Lord for
give me for forgetting!"
"Well, all I can say." averred Lau
rel in a voice of brisk finality, "is that
he has evidently kept you in his neart
all this time. And â don't be too bard
on the poor fellow, Aunt Varina!"'
Miss Varina preened herself â pat
ting the bow on her neck coquettish
iy.
"You're a good child," she mur
mured, her eyes on the wonderful ob
ject propped up on the cottage organ.
"I may have been a little severe about
you and Charlie, and if â "
But, deeming it best to let well
enough alone, Laurel had slipped
from the room.
Charlie Mead, a stalwart young fel
! low, coming home that night from nis
work in the town bank, found his
uncle, a grim-visaged, sad-eyed man,
brooding above a delicate piece of rice
paper, foamed over with forget-me
nots. It was a trivial little thing, but
pretty and in good taste.
"Charlie, look here! Some one has
sent me a valentine."
"Well, why not, sir I'm sure you're
younger in heart and better looking
by a long shot than many of the men
to whom it is the custom, I am told,
for girls to send valentines to-day!
You can't expect to remain a widower
always. The girls of Thomastown ate
not too dense â "
The elder man raised a perturbed
face.
â¢'Xo girl in Thomaatown sent me
this! There are initials signed â " He
broke off In embarrassment.
"By Jove! So there are! "
"They are V. .H. E." The young
man looked interrogatively at his un
cle. "I can't think of any one having
those â "
"It might be Varina Hlldegarde
Ellington," said Ambrose Mead.
"Why, uncle! And after all your
opposition to my marrying Laurel.
What a concentrated fraud you are!"
"I â I may have been â a bit se
vere!" the elder man admitted. "I â I
fancied Miss Ellington disliked me
very much on account of â well, that's

a mere matter of neighborly courtsey,
I ought to go over after supper and

QUAKER CITY SOCIETY
BELLES MUST STOP
WEARING CHAMELEONS
A CHAINED CHAMELEON AS AN I
ORNAMENT FOR THE HAIR. '
THE peculiar fancy of the soci
ety girls of Philadelphia for
wearing live chameleons in
their hair, or attached to
their waists, is to be stopped
by the Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals of the Quaker
City, says the Philadelphia corre
spondent of the Cincinnati Enquirer.
It is claimed that the little lizards
suffer torture while chained to the
hair of their wearers, and that dur
ing a dance they are frequently shak
en from their perch and hang dang
ling from the chain until replaced by
the wearer. The fashion, a revival of
one that had vogue in New York and
other cities some years ago, Is not
considered a pretty one by the critics
of fashion, and the outcry against it
is so strong that the prosecution of
the wearers of the chameleon would
be hailed with pleasure by many.
Nevertheless the pretty little crawlers
are selling fast and the fad is grow
ing. The chameleons cost only a
quarter, with chain attached, so that
the fancy is not an expensive one.
I SENT MY SWEET
A VALENTINE.
T sent my sweet a valentine
wherein I asked would she be mine.

getting over its broken knee all
right!"
Charlie grinned, vanished and ex
ecuted a war dance in the hall.
"Better wear jour most becoming
gown to-night â the crimson cash
mere!" urged Laurel. "It is quite
likely Mr. Mead will follow his val
entine with a visit. I'll do the dishes!"
And Mr. Mead, in best Sunday at
tiro, did call. But hardly had Miss
Varina received him in the parlor
when a tall young man whisked in at
the back door, caught a slim maiden
up to her arms in soapy water, and
carried her from the kitchen sink to
the china closet. He had a compelling
hand over her lips.
"It won't be eavesdropping." he
whispered, "to hear if we get out scot
free about those valentines. It was
the only way to get the antagonistic
couple to release their grip on vs â to
set them thinking about a love affair
of their own. Listen!"
This they heard through the slid
ing door brtween the china closet and
dining-room:
"If it were not for that valentine,
Ambrose, I'd never â "
"Nor I, Varina. It was fate. Prom

LEGAL FIGHT
IS PROBABLE
Methodist Book Concern
May Be Involved in a
r.attle Before the Courts
<A\< ELS TRANSACTION
Disposal of Local Property
to Louis Friedman May Be
Bone of Hot Contention
A hot legal fight is likely to result
from the recent attempted sale of the '
Methodist Book Concern property at !
1037 Market street. News received here 1
yesterday indicates that the contract of ;
sale executed by direction of Eaton &!â 
Mains, the Book Concern agents in New ;
York, has been repudiated by the high- j
er authorities of the church, who have |
ordered the sale canceled. On the oth- I
er hand, the purchaser, Louis Friedman .
of this city, who has paid a deposit on
the purchase price, $125,000, and claims i
ownership in the event the title proves \
clear, declares, he will not give up his j
contract unless well paid to do so. I
Leading local Methodists assert that j
this contract was invalid from the be- j
ginning, Eaton & Mains having no au- j
thority to make it.
The Call has already published the j
facts of the sale and the resulting dif
ferences of opinion among Meth
odists regarding it, but a tele
gram received yesterday from C. B.
Perkins, secretary to the Book Concern
commission in this city, who is -at pres
ent in New York, has placed a new
complexion on the whole transaction.
It was at a meeting of the Methodist
Ministers' Association that the tele
: gram was read, and its receipt and con
tents caused the liveliest interest, not
to say Joy, among those who strenu
ously oppose the sale of the present
[ premises.
Perkins sent the telegram to Dr. E.
R. Dille and it was read as follows:
"Committee ordered sale of property
canceled. Transfer to Western agents."
The Eastern agents of the Book Con
| cern are Eaton & Mains of New York
City, and the Western agents are Jen
! nings & Graham of Cincinnati.
Immediately after the sale was an
' nounced Mr. Perkins, accompanied by !
Dr. Fred Bovard, editor of the Metho- j
dist Christian Advocate, hastened to j
t New York in order to attend a meeting
1 of the general conference book commit- !
j tee. which represents the whole church ,
: and supervises its publishing interests j
in all parts of the country. The tele- ;
gram from Perkins therefore indicates [
that the book committee has ordered I
the Eastern agents, Eaton & Mains, to :
cancel the sale to Louis Friedman and
make the transfer of the property to '
Jennings & Graham.
To a Call representative Louis Fried
! man said:
I have nothing to do with the matter beyond
having bought the property from Eaton &
Mains, the Book Concern agents at New York. â 
The deed Is In the bank In Ban Francisco,
and Just as soon as my lawyer, Milton S.
Eisner, passes on the title, the balance of i
the purchase price, which Is $125,000, agreed
on between myself and Eaton & Mains, will .
be raid.
In answer to a question whether he '
â would be willing to forego any claim to ;
the property should the Book Concern '
ask him to do so, Friedman said:
There has been nothing mentioned question- i
ing my right to the property. I would not re- |
linquish It unless paid what I consider I ought
to make on the transaction, as I disposed of
a piece of property on Stockton street, near
Vallejo, In order to purchase this. I would
not have done so If I had not considered the !
buying of the Book Concern building an abso- '
lute certainty.
William Abbott of the local Book
Concern said that no further details
had been received and he could there
fore make no explanation of the can
cellation.
Further news received from the East
was the resignation of Rolla V. Watt j
I from the local Book Concern commis- j
j sion, which looks after the San Fran- \
cisco house. His place has been filled
by J. F. Forderer, president of the ,
Board of Trustees of Alameda. Watt i
has gone on a six months' trip to Eu- I
rope, hence his resignation.

COCKNEY'S MISPLACED CONFIDENCE
LEADS HIM FAR FROM HOME.
TRAVELER FROM "LUNNON 11 ]
IS IN SERIOUS TROUBLE
Lives on Compatriots Aid
JAMES C. CRAWFORD
William Pinhb, a diminutive cockney,
accused of obtaining $1 50 by false pre
tense from A. P. Kellogg of 296 Second
street, pleaded not guilty and volubly
rattled off a chapter of his life history
for the enlightenment of Police Judge
Mogan.
"In me yer^gee a wictim of mispliced
cawnfldence, sir," he said. "If I 'adn't
b'lieved wot the noospalpers geyed I'd
be 'appy* at me 'ome in Geneva plaice,
Brixton, Lunnon. A hunscrup'lous an'
hextravagant press hindooced me to
emigrate to Canada by siyin' that a
bloke wot knoo nothin' wotsumever
abeout farmin' could mike thirty or
forty dollars a month. W'en I goes to
the commissioner in Quecbec, sir, 'c
siys 'c can get me a Job at $5 a month,
an', of course, I siys, 'Nawnsense,' 'cos
I can do better than that at 'ome. But
'twas the best 'c would do for me, sir,
an' after many hups an' downs I finds
meself 'ere. But I 'aven't hembezzled
nobuddy's money, sir; plaice b'lieve
me."
It was pretty clearly proven, how
ever, that since his arrival here last
September Mr. Robb has been living
on the charity of sympathetic com
patriots. The British consulate has
given him many meal tickets, and Mr.
Kellogg took him to a brass foundry
and obtained for him a situation. He
was told to begin work the following
morning, and on the evening of that
day he visited Mr. Kellogg and by rep
resenting that he had Just ceased labor
obtained $1 50 from that gentleman,
whereas the truth was that he had not
appeared at the foundry at all.
"I mide the faital mlstaike of waitln'
till I could join the union before I went
to work," he informed the Judge.
"But why haven't you tried to get
away from this country and vagabond
age?" his Honor asked.
"I've tried to get hopportoonity to
work me passage to Haustralia," was
the answer, "but every captain I
hawsked to ship me said 'Prepawstrus.'
I ain't a sailor, sir, an' the skippers
eied I'd be more In the wiy than a 'elp
to them."
He is held until the British Vice Con
sul can be consulted as to character.
In an affidavit filed in Judge Fritz's
court by Mrs. Augusta M. Rogers she
cheerfully acknowledges that she had
her husband, James, arrested for bat
tery "more to deter him and frighten
him than for the purpose of punishing
him." The document avers further that
on the evening of February 4 the af
fiant and her husband "had words in a
slight difficulty over family matters,"
and that her testimony when she ap
peared as prosecutrix was in substance
as follows:
He said to me, "You drive me to drink,"
and I said, "Nothing of the kind," and we
l^ad an argument over another woman. It Is
not necessary to repeat overy word of the
conversation. I hit him on the arm and
said. "You can't deny about that woman."
After that we both got angry and excited and
1-e grabbed me by the hands and hit me. I
raised the front window and called for the
police, but there was no one to be seen. Then
I Flipped out on the back porch and then I
called, and he locked tha door and went
ay.ay.
The affiant continues that she would
like to change her testimony with rela
tion to her husband striking her. She
adds:
I do not think he would have touched me
had it not been that I struck him first, and
thin he grabbed me and In the difficulty I was
either struck with his open hand or pushed.
It i-aus.-.l a little swelling, but no marks at all.
It is not true that my face was discolored, for
my skin does not discolor at all when I am
rtruck or bruised in any way. It might
cause a swelling, but never discolors.
I want also to state that I was the start of
it all. for if I had not said anything or opened
argument when lie came in nothing whatever
would have happened.
My husband never struck me before or raised
his hand to me and I. would request the court
in this matter to be as lenient as possible
and withdraw the charge, as I think ho has
Tv-en sufficiently punished, because I feel that
I am more to blame than he Is.
Is it necessary to say that Mr. Rog
er* is assured of acquittal?
George A. Smith, who stole a watch
from an auditor of a political spellbind
er on Grant avenue, got six months
from Judge Conlan.
Special Policeman Delmar's eleventh
rib on the left side was fractured as a
result of his brief interview with Mar
tin Joyce last Sunday afternoon at Oak
and Devisadero streets, and Mr. Joyce
!s in custody as the author of the In-
Jury. Suspecting that Mr. Joyce was
implicated Jn a recent highway rob
bery, the policeman started to question
him on the subject, when he was sud
denly seized with Jiu-jitsu deftness and
hoisted over a water trough, describing
a parabola ere he alighted upon the
asphaltum roadway with one of his
ribs broken. So unrepentant was Mr.
Joyce that he was drunk when he ap
peared before Judge Mogan to answer
for the assault, and now he is In cus
tody, while the police are trying to con
firm the suspicion whose expression by
Delmar resulted In the temporary put
ting of that officer out of commission.

WllHam Toy. with a half-consumed
cigarette behind one ear and a match
behind the other, stared wildly at Judge
Fritz and attempted to prove an alibi
by asserting that on Sunday evening
h* saved the {own of Fresno from de
molition by earthquake by utilizing a
patented device of his invention, where-*,
as the prosecuting policeman had sworn I
that on Saturday night he arrested the';
defendant in this city for opium-smok- '
ing. The court took the officer's word
in preference to that of Mr. Toy and
sentenced the latterSto six months' im
prisonment.

Miss Virginia TVestcode also ran
afoul of the law in Chinatown. She
was hilarious to the point of peace >
disturbance when two policemen I
started her prlsonward from Washing
ton and Kearny streets Saturday even
ing.
"I was watching the Chinks at their
New Year foolery," she informed
Judge Mogan, "and one of them gave
me a drink of samshu, which I was
just idiot enough to take. After that
any old thing might have happened,
you know, and I guess these two cops
are all right when they say I was
making a free show of myself."
She readily paid a $5 fine.
â¢ â¢ â¢
Wah Ying deplored the incident for
reasons other than either the pecuni
ary loss or physical agony to which
he had been subjected. While the
wrecking of his chop suey establish
ment at 925 Stockton street and the
smiting of his nose were regrettable
he was more deeply pained by the
routing from his soul of the love of
species which had nestled there ever
since the Chinese New Year festival
began. When the three youthful de
fendants entered his shop he received
them with kowtows and expressions
of good will, despite their Caucasian,
blood, and as they sat and consumed
70 cents' worth of his choicest viands
he waited on them in person and did
everything that a spirit of amiability
could suggest to make their feast a
memorable one, even going so far as
to augment gratuitously the regular
fare with certain delicacies which he^
had reserved for his very best custom
ers and most esteemed friends. He
tickled their palates with morsels of
fricasseed lizard and gave them nib
bles of shark's fin and sips of birds'
nest soup such as a mandarin would
be thankful for. What was his grief,
therefore, to be rewarded by having
$2 50 worth of dishes irreparably
shattered, some of his daintiest food
hurled against the walls and ceiling
j and his nose violently struck by the
clenched flst of one of the lngratea, he
could not positively say which of
them. But his bespattered walls and
his bleeding nasal organ were trifles
as compared to the consequent anger
ing of his heart. He could forgive
and forget all else but that â provid
ed his monetary loss were made good.
Harry Green, Harry Devania and
Antone Lopez were the names under
which the defendants faced Judge
Mogan and none of them could ex
plain himself guiltless. So they were
found guilty of peace disturbance and
remanded for sentence, which will
probably be measured in accordance
with the material compensation
which each or all of them furnishes
Wah Ying for his broken crockery
and facial damages. As for the injury
to his soul, it never can be paid for.

Henry F. Wagner, as administrator of the es

Lyser, be transferred to some other
school.
A number of parents of pupils was
present and voiced opposition to the
action of the Board of Education,
which they said has resulted in com
pelling small children to cross two
car lines and travel a long distance
to either of the two schools. They
represented that when the Noe Valley
School was built they were given to
understand that a complete or mixed
course would be installed therein, but
instead the grammar classes had been
withdrawn. The board now declines
to establish a sixth grade.
One mother said her child was
forced to walk five blocks to the
James Lick School. Another parent
said his child had to stay at home
for one week owing to the long dis
tance to be traveled in the rain. He
said it was not right that a petty
squabble among the teachers should
be the cause of working a hardship
on the pupils.
"The Board of Education Is prac
tically keeping us out of our own
school," said another parent, "and
pretty soon we will not be allowed
to go into our own houses."
Principal Lyser denied a statement
that a pupil was compelled to pass
the James Lick School and go to the
Noa Valley School.
M. Lemaine said that the change
had been made for the accommoda
tion of the teachers and not the pu
pils owing to dissensions and lack of
discipline in the James Lick School.
Chairman Lunstedt ruled the remarks
out of order, saying the only ques
tion at issue was the arriving at an
amicable adjustment of the matter.
School Director Boyle said the
change was a question purely of edu
cation and not of finance, It being the
policy of the board to establish sep
arate primary and grammar schools.
Superintendent Langdon said the
board wished to give the people in the
Noe Valley district the best school
service. Only 20 per cent of the pu
pils, he said, had to walk five blocks.
The committee admitted that it had
no jurisdiction and referred the pro
tests to the Board of Education to
take ud with the West of Castro Club
and recommending if possible the re
storing of the old conditions at the
two schools.
WIDOW OF THOMAS BELL
WINS LARGE ARREARAGES
Judge Coffey Decides She Is Entitled
to Allowance Xot Paid by Ex
ecutors of Estate.
Teresa Bell, w r idow of Thomas Bell,
has made good her claim for arrear
ages in family allowances from the
estate. Judge Coffey yesterday or
dered the executors to pay her $32,
665 80 due for the period from June
17, 1893, the date the inventory of
the estate was filed, to August 14,
1895, when an order of court reduced
the allowance. Mrs. Bell, before fil
ing the inventory, was receiving $2000
a month.
In February, 1894, a petition by the
executors was filed asking the reduc
tion of the allowance. Later the pe
tition was dropped from the calendar
and the order was entered, but by
mistake or inadvertence the clerk
neglected to enter an order made at
the same time directing that the al
lowance be continued at $2000 a
month. After January of that year
the executors did not pay the full
amount, representing that the income
of the estate was not sufficient to pay
interest and assessments, which had
to be paid to prevent the forced sale
of valuable securities. Mrs. Bell con
sented to this use of the money, but,
believing that the arrearages would be
paid later, she borrowed $20,000 and
used $17,000 from the sale of her sep
arate property to make up the differ
ence needed by the family. During
the period of her waiting the execu
tors paid her $39,334, and when she
petitioned for the balance due she was
met with the opposition of nearly all
the creditors and trustees of the es
tate. \
Steffens' Trial Closing.
The trial of Adolph Steffens,
charged with fraudulently voting at
the last primary election, went on in
Judge Lawlor's court yesterday. The
most important witness examined was
Theodore Kytka, handwriting expert,
who identified Steffens' writing as the
same as that in the signature of "C. A.
Crew," the name under which Steffens
is accused of fraudulently voting.
Secretary McCarthy of the Board of
Fire Commissioners testified that Stef
fens was appointed a member of the
drp artrnent on September 23 and that
or September 30. the day on which
the indictment was filed against him.
Steffens asked for and obtained leave
of absence. Detective Taylor testified
to Steffens' arrest Jn Los Angeles,
where he had been living under an
assumed name.
FATHER APPEARS
TO DEFEND SON
Unusual Spectacle Is Wit
nessed at Arraignment ot
Alien Goucher for Murder
TRIAL SET FOR MAKCH 1
Defendant Stands Accused of !
Complicity in the Killing
of Policeman Robinson
The unusual spectacle of a father
appearing in court to defend hU son on
a charge of murder was witnessed in \
Judge Cook's courtroom yesterday !
morning. The father was Attorney
George A. Goucher of Madera, ex-State
Senator, and the defendant was his ,
son, Allen H. (Jourher, known as "Kid"
Goucher, charged with complicity in
the murder of Policeman Eugene C.
Robinson at Sixteenth and Valencia
streets on the morning of January 21,
mi.
The defendant appeared for arraign
ment yesterday and when the case was
called ex-State Senator Goucher rose
and In a voice which betrayed emotion
he said: "This man standing before
you accused of complicity In the mm- .
der of Policeman Eugene C. Robins* > Â»
i 3 my son, Allen Goucher. I am an at
torney at law and propose to conduct
his defense. As an attorney I am also \
an officer of the court and as such I I
propose that full Justice shall he done. |
Up to March 1 I shall be engaged In i
legal matters in Madera and I now ask !
that this case go over until that time. " j
No objection was raised by Assistant '
District Attorney Ashe and the Jud*"
continued the case for trial till that
date.
Of the six persons Implicated in the
murder five were speedily arrested.
Frank Woods, alias "St. Louis Frank,"
was tried and convicted of murder In
the first degree and sentenced to be
hanged, but the case is on appeal;
Louis Kauffmann, alias "St. Louis
Fat," was sentenced to twenty-five
years in San Quentin; John Coulter, !
alias "Leadville Jimmie," was sen
tenced to six years in San Quentin. !
and William Kennedy, alias "Yellow, "
was tried but finally acquitted, owing ;
to the lack of evidence. William Hen
derson, who turned State's evidence,
pleaded guilty to manslaughter, but ;
has not been sentenced as he has yet
to testify at the Goucher trial.

URGES REVISION
OF LAND LAWS
President Concurs in the
Eecommendation of the
Public Domain Committee
WASHINGTON, Feb. 13.â A second
partial report of the Public Lands Com-
I mission was sent to Congress to-day
; by President Roosevelt, who in his let
ter of transmittal said the report seems
; "to require a radical revision of most
of the laws affecting the public domain
If v.c are to secure the best possible use
of the remaining public lands by actual
homo-makers." The President's letter
i follows:
1 submit herewith the second partial report
| of the Public Lands Commission, appointed by
me October "J2, 1903, to report upon thÂ» condi-
Umii. operation and effect of the public land
laws and to recommend euch changes as are
needed to effect the largest practical disposi
tion of the public lands to actual settlers who
will build homes upon them and to secure
in permanence the fullest and most effective
use of the resources of the public lands.
The subject Is one of such magnitude and
Importance that I have concluded to submit
this second partial report bearing upon some
of the larger features which require immediate
mention without waiting for thÂ» final state
ment of the commission, which, from the very
' nature of the case, it has not been possible
to complete at this time. I am in full sym
iiHtliy with the general conclusions of the
commission In pubstance and in essence, and
I commend its recommendations to your earn
ert and favorable consideration. The existing
conditions as set forth in this report eeetn
to i 'quire a radical revision of most of the
lw.Â« affecting the public domain, if we are
to secure the best possible use of the remaln
; ing public lands by actual home-makers.
The report was sigmed by W. A. Rich
ards, Land Commissioner; F. A. Newell
; of the Geological Survey and Glfford
; Pinchot, chief of the Bureau of Forest-
I ry. In a summary of its recommenda
tions the report says the conclusions
are based on a broad general view of
the public land situation, not on specific
cases. Among other things the com
mission says:
The agricultural possibilities of the Govern
| ment lands arc unknown. Provision should
be made to ascertain them and. pending
such ascertainment, to hold, under' Government
control and in trust for v such use. the lands
likely to be developed by actual settlers.
The right to exchange lands in forest re
serves for lands outside should be withdrawn.
Provision should be made for the purchase of
needed private lands inside forestry reserves
or for the exchange of such lands for specified
tracts of like area and value outside the re
serves.
The report renews its recommenda
tion for the repeal of the timber and
stone act, and asks that the sale of the
timber from unreserved public lands be
authorized. The report continues:
â¢ The desert land law is found to lead to
monopoly in many cases. The area of desert
entry should be reduced to not exceeding 100
acres. Actual residence for not less than two
years should be required, with the actual pro
duction of a valuable crop on one- fourth the
area and proof of an adequate water eupply.
The commission opposes the imme
diate application of any rigid system
to all grazing lands, but recommends
that the President be authorized to set
aside grazing districts by proclamation,
these to be under the control of the
Secretary of Agriculture. The sum
mary concludes with the statement that
the number of patents issued is in
creasing out of all proportion to the
number of new homes.

Wellington Gregg Jr., Edwin Schwab
and t Bay Counties Land and Devel
opment Company. Judgment is de
manded for $773,167 77 and an account
ing of the use of 8000 shares of Contra
Costa stock and the use of $295,000 ap
propriated for the alleged purposes of
perfecting: titles and compromising
prospective litigation.
The complaint embodies in one suit
the two suits begun by Mrs. Center,
and the allegations are the same as
those set forth in her actions. First it
is recited that in February, 1903, the
directors, conspiring with Alvinza Ha>
ward, resolved to purchase the Pinole
tract, for which 8000 Contra Costa
shares were given to the Bay Counties
Company and $73,167 77 to Bernardo
Fernandez. It is declared that the Bay
Counties Company was organized by
the Contra Costa directors as a medium
through which the tract could be con
veyed, and that the tract was not
worth more than $100,000, whereas the
Contra Costa shares were valued at
$800,000. It. is said that the great profit
"was enjoyed by the defendants other
than the Contra Costa Water Com
pany."
In relation to the appropriation of
$300,000 to "secure titles and compro
mise prospective litigation," and the
immediate approval of Dingee'a ex
penditure of $295,000 for those purposes,
it is alleged that "the money was not
paid as pretended, but for uses not
authorized." It Is also declared that
the directors of the corporation at that
time "were mere agents of Dingee and
did as he directed."

cision Against Mrs. Minnie
Johns of San Francisco
Special Dispatch to ThÂ» Call.
LINCOLN", Nebr., Feb. 13. â In a de
cree handed down this morning Judge
Ccrnish of the Lancaster District Court
declared that Mrs. Minnie Johns of
San Francisco was forever barred
from valuable business and residence
property valued at $50,000. Alfred G.
Osmer will receive the property. He
is the stepfather of Mrs. Johns.
When Mrs. Osmer died the property
was all in her name. Mrs. Johns laid
claim to it as the heir, under the Ne
braska statutes. At the trial a wit
ness was introduced by Osmer to
prove that Osmer, a meat dealer, had
amassed the fortune and merely kept
it in the name of his wife for business
reasons. It was on this testimony that
the ruling of the Judge was based.

ADE IS GOING
TO THE ORIENT
Well Known Playwright and
Author Arrives Here Af
ter a Tour of Mexico
HAS TWO PLAYS READY
Will No Longer Contribute
Modern Fables in Slang
Because of the Monotony
Georfe Ade, author and playwright,
whose "Modern Fabies in Slang" have
furnished interesting reading matter to
the American public, arrived here yes
terday and Is staying at the Palace.
Ade is one of a party of travelers, com
posed of A. 3. Laflin, a wealthy resi
dent of Chicago, and his wife, and C
C. Kent of Kentland, 111., who have
just completed a tour of Mexico and
are now on their way to the Orient.
Ade has been In San Francisco be
fore, once during the Midwinter Fair
and again on his return from the
Philippines, where he got his inspira
tion for his play. "The Sultan of Sulu."
Since then he has written a number of
plays, the latest of which was "The
County Chairman," recently produced
in this city. In discussing his produc
tions and his future Ade said yester
day:
I am through with "Fables in Slang/ for
the continual grind became too monotonous
and trying. Unlike the Dooley contributions,
my articles proved too great a task. The Doo
ley articles arc editorials in dialect and are
constructed from fresh subjects In a manner
that constantly interest Uie reader and arÂ«
cleverly handled by their author. Hereafter I
propose to devote my time to plays, of which
I now have two in preparation. One is for
Henry Savage and the other for Charles Froh
man. For the Savage piece we selected the title
of "A Second Time on Earth." but later dis
covered that the title was already in use. Con
sequently we abandoned it and have not aa yet
rechristened the play. For Frohman I am
preparing a play that will be produced first
In the provinces and later In New Tort ThÂ«
other production will appear first In Washing
ton In September and if successful it will bÂ«
put on the boards in New York City.
Ade said with a noticeable emphasis
that he is not going to Japan to get
material for another, play, for he de
clared that his last one. "The Shogun,"
which was responsible for him being se
verely criticized by the American crit
ics, who accused him of having stolen
it from "The Mikado," had made him
decide not to undertake a second one.
Of his plays now on the road the au
thor said "The College Widow" had
proved the best money-maker, having
made a hit from the time it was first
produced in New York. "Peggy From
Paris" had done well in Boston, but
the critics of New York did not take
kindly to it. "With his friends, he will
leave to-morrow for Japan on the
steamship Korea, and expects to be
back in New Tork about the latter
part of April.
NOTARY HORN
ON THE GRILL
Kefuses to Admit That He
Ever Certified to a Paper
Without Presence of Party
Notary Public Harry L. Horn spent
an unpleasant quarter of an hour yes
terday afternoon on the witness stand
in the United States District Court.
He had identified certain affidavits
made before him by Louie Hock, Tang
Leong and Jan Kan to the effect that
Tong Tuai H*o. alias IA Mi Ho. a Chi
nese girl who arrived on the steam
ship China last July, was a native of
this city. Jan Kan was on trial for
attempting to procure the landing of
the girl by means of a false affidavit.
Xotary Horn said that he rould not
identify the prisoner at the bar as one
of the Chinamen whom he had cer
tified .on the affidavit as being per
sonally known to him.
Thomas C West, counsel for Jan
Kan, tried to make the witness say
that it was the custom for notaries in
this city to certify afffdavits in the
absence of the parties signing and
swearing to them, but Mr. Horn coyly
declined to admit such a state of
facts.
"Now. Mr. Horn," continued Law
yer West, "have you not done it for
me?"
Before the witness could reply
Judge de Haven remarked severely:
"If such be the fact it is a very grave
misdemeanor."
"O. your Honor." quickly inter
jected Mr. West, "I never used it. I
couldn't get the man to acknowledge
it."
Horn denied that such was the
custom and he departed from the
stand with thick beads of perspira
tion on his face.

GRAVE CHARGES MADE IN
OBJECTIONS TO AN ACCOUNT
Executor of Emma Pease's Estate-Ac
cused |pf . Mismanagement and
Falsehood.
The first and final account of Albert
Simons, -who was appointed executor
of the estate of Emma Pease in Au
gust, 1901. was on the calendar for
settlement In Judge Coffey's court yes
terday morning, but it met with
the strenuous objections of Louise
Simons, one of the heirs. The estate
is not of much value, but according
to the objector it has been grossly
mismanaged by Simons. The Items of
her objections cover many Interesting
pages. She says he has credited him
self with expenditures which have
never been made and credited himself
several times with the same items of
expenditures.
Most important in her allegations is
a charge in reference to a piece of
realty formerly owned by the estate,
but now In the name Â»f the execu
tor's wife. She says it was first ap
praised at $3000. An order for its
sale was made and $2700 was bid for
the property. It should have been
sold, says the objector, but was not
because of the executor's personal dis
like for the bidder. On account of
Simons' negligence, she says, the
property deteriorated in value and was
returned in the 6econd inventory at
$1600, was sold to Simons' sister-in
law, Thena Tellbron, for $1600 and
by her was sold to Simons' wife. It
is charged that thia procedure was an
attempt to circumvent the code. Â»
It is charged that the executor has
neglected to make an account hereto
fore, although he has been three times
cited to do so by the heirs.

ONE MEMBER FEELS
THAT HE CAXXOT SIT
Si Jurists Divide Evenly
on Contest, and Seventh,
for Personal Keasons.
Declines to Participate
The Supreme Court will soon be
composed of eight Justices, instead of
eeven. This remarkable state of af
fairs is due to the modesty of one
member of the tribunal and a division
of opinion on the part of the other six
jurists. It Is proposed as a way out
of the difficulty that Governor Pardee
appoint a Judge of the District Court I
of Appeals as â  temporary member of
thr Supreme Court.
The trouble has arisen out of a civil
suit over property rights. It is en
titled Kennedy vs. Lee. Garret W.
McEnerney represents one of the con
testants, -V.J. C Campbell the other.
Th- case was submitted severalf
months ago. Three Justices believed I

of the parties to the suit considered j
Itini an enemy and he preferred to let
hit six associates decide the case with- ,
out his aid. His wishes were re- I
spected, but no agreement could be
res "d.
The facts in the case were made
known to Attorneys McEnerney and
Campbell and the case was reset for
a second argument before the Justices
to-day. Yesterday afternoon McEner
rey appeared in court and asked that
th* argument be postponed th view of
the fact that Campbell had reqdested
a continuance on account of enforced
absence in the East. Justice Van
Dyke was not present and none of
the other jurists seemed to have any
inclination t* change his mind about
the case. McEnerney said he should i
nor be content to argue the matter
without a full court, as was his right
according to the law.
Chief Justice Beatty said he would
hether Justice Van Dyke would

COOK UPHOLDS
AN ORDINANCE
Raid by Members of Grand
Jury and Deputy Sheriffs
Held to Have Been Legal
JUDGMENT IS DIVIDED
Women Charged With Being
Inmates Are Remanded,
but Visitors Discharged
An exhaustive opinion was delivered
by Judge Cook yesterday on the appli
cation for writs of habeas corpus for
the release of the seventy-nine women
arrested at 620 Jackson street and 1129
Dupont street at the time the raid was
made by deputy sheriffs and members
of the Grand Jury. He holds, in effect, i
that the ordinance under which the ar-
Kata were made is valid, but in regard
to those charged with being visitors to ]
a house of ill-fame he decides that the
complaints were defective, inasmuch as
no public offense was charged.
It was argued for the petitioners that
the ordinance conflicted with sections
IIS and 647 of the Penal Code, which
provide for the punishment of resi
dents in houses of ill-fame. 1t being ar
gued that the words resident and in
mate were synonymous. The Judge did
not agree with thai contention, holding
that the words were not synonymous.
As it was alleged in the complaints
that the acts done wer contrary to the
statutes of thfÂ» State, the prisoners
chargrod with being: inmates would be
remanded. Their bail, however, pend
ing trial was reduced to $50 bonds or $20
cash. j
Regarding thege charged with being
visitors, tlie Judgre said it was an es- '
srntial element of the crime charged
that the defendant knew the charac
ter of the bouse and that shÂ» visited
the same for a purpose intended to be
made unlawful by the ordinance. "If.
these are essential elements of the ,
crime." continued the Judge, "and must
be proved by the prosecution before a
conviction could be hadâ and unques
tionably they are, else ihe ordinance is
voidâ it is equally essential that they
be alleged, and a failure to allege them
renders the complaint fatally defective.
That the lack of any allegation in th^
complaints against the petitioners a^
to knowledge and purpose of the visit
charged is fatally defective there can
be no question." The prisoners charged
with bein^ visitors were therefore or
dered dismissed.
All the cases were continued till to
morrow, so that those remanded and
those discharged could be sifted out.
SUPREME COURT IS CURIOUS.
Justices Inquire Closely About 1129
I>tipont Street.
The Supreme Court yesterday heard
argruments in reference to the injunc
tion issued by Judge Cook to restrain
the police from raiding 1129 Dupont
street. The Justices interrogated the
attorneys for the contestants as to the
real eharacer of the place and seemed
satisfied that the premises were used
for disreputable purposes. The old
question a= to whether the police had
the right to hurt tho business of the
alleged restaurant proved bothersome,
however, and the case was ordered
submitted.
Brief arguments were heard in an
other proceeding through which ex-
Police Commissioner Hutton hopes to
c paying a $100 fine for raiding
1129 Dupont street in violation of an
injunction and this matter was also
submitted.
In the course of ex-Judge Louder
back's remarks in favor of the de
posed ofti'-ial's conduct the court was
compelled repeatedly to direct the at
torney not to wander from his argu
ment. ' The admonitions amused the
spectators.

SOCIETY YOUNG FOLK WHO WILL.
TAKE PART IN BEXEFrT FOR
CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL.
SALLY SHARP
The philanthropic days have come,
the gladdest of the yearâ for such as
have a little change to spare. And
I somehow, in this busy Western burg,
there's always change â and to spare â
for the sick and heavy-laden. And as
for suffering babies, there's no tenderer
spot on earth than San Franciscoâ for
note the hospitals reared for their
care. But these hospitals are not sup
ported wholly by their tiny inmates,
hence the call at times for help.
The latest bid for assistance comes
from the auxiliary of the Children's
Hospital, and bebold what is offeredâ
a vaudeville potpourri to be given at
the Alhambra to-morrow night, in
which a load of smashing surprises
will be sprung.
There are to be a lot of "stunts" by
smart maids and matrons, including
Mrs. Frederick Kohl, Mrs. Camille i
tVArville-Crellin, Miss Cora Smedberg,
Miss Ethel Patton, Miss Bessie Mc-
Near, Miss Genevieve King, Miss Hazel
King, Miss Mattie Livermore, Mrs.
John F. Babcock, Mrs. Eugene Murphy,
Mrs. Frederic Kimball, Mrs. Willard
Drown, Mrs. Worthington Ames and
Miss Lucle King.
Besides the clever playlet "In Toy
land," that was given with such snap
and ginger at "Meadowlands" last
summer, will be presented by the
"original cast," as the play bills say. |
j This will bring Miss Constance De j
j Young, Miss Pearl Landers and Miss
I Helen Wagner before the footlights.
Clever?
Just ask those who saw the affair
ai the De Young garden party last
summer!
Then Courtney Ford promises a
sketch that is said to be rattling good,
and Mrs. Willard Drown, Mrs. George
Martin, Miss Anita Harvey, Miss Vir
ginia Jolliffe, Miss Genevieve King,
Miss Ethel Dean, Miss Gertrude Jos
selyn, Miss Edith Berry, Misg Ysabel
Brewer, Mrs. Percy Moore and Mrs.
Fred MoNear will pose as miniatures.
Now, isn't that a lot for your money
âyour $1 50?
And by the way, don't forget to ex
change your tickets for reserved seats
at Sherman, Clay & Co.'s.
From the look of things It would
seem the smart folk of town will be
gathered together again in the big barn
on Eddy streetâ all for the little sick
babies.
Railroad Injunction Submitted.
The application of the California
Northwestern Railroad Company for
an injunction to prevent the crossing
of its line by the Petaluma and Santa
Rcsa electric line on Sebastopol ave
nue, Santa Rosa, was heard and taken
under submission by Judge Seawell
yesterday. The old road bases its
right upon the grant of a right of way
from the owners. Right is also
claimed by reason of possession un
der the statues since 1869. It con-
Unds that it is too late to question its
easement and that a crossing should
not be permitted until the condemna
tion proceedings now pending are
prosecuted and the place and manner
of the crossing isAletermined by the
court. Sebastopol avenue was opened
as a public road in 1855 and deeds
were introduced in evidence tracing
the title in fee of the land it occupies.
BUFFALO. N. T., Feb. 13.â Two men, giv
ing the names of Stanley Welhousky and Thad
deus Urbanowis, have been arrested in con
nection with the alleged attempt to shoot
Bishop Stephen Kaminski of the Independent
Catholic Church (Polish) late Saturday night.

the day when the uncopyrighted jingle
written by Adam, "The rose is red.. the
violers blue," etc., is extensively pla
giarized.
It's the chance of the small boy to
remind the old maid that it looks bad
for her, and to recall to the fat man
the painful fact that he has not seen
his shoes for several years.
The dilapidated poet tried to break
the "rose is red" combination. Here
are a few of his spasms:
A Sacramento valentine â "The rose is
red, the coin is yellow, and when it
flies, I'm the fellow."
A sporting valentineâ "The Britt Is
white, and Gans is black; but Joseph
brought the money back."
A rounder's Valentineâ "Your nose is
red. and so is mine; Oh, barkeep, open
up the wine!"
Many budding poets will send forth
the results of their jiu-jitsu with the
muses to-day. Come to think of it,
It's easyâ mine and thine and valen
tine rhyme, and "any old hot air" will
do the rest. While stein and swine
rhyme, they are barred for obvious rea
sons.
It is best to accept Valentine's day
good-naturedly, as a necessary evil.
Last Valentine's day a tragedy oc
curred in the family of JÂ» Blibbetts of
this city. Miss Henrietta Blibbetts, the
eldest unmarried daughter, had re
ceived in the early part of the day some
comic valentines that made her weep.
Her fond father greased the front steps
and lay in wait with a pail of hot
water for the guilty miscreant.
Footsteps were heard on the stair
way. Pa Blibbetts let fly with the pail.
Something fell down the stairway with
a screech. Miss Bllbbetts went down to
gloat over the remains. Curtains. It
was the one young man she had re
garded as standing between her and
the Old Ladies' Home.

ANDREWS' ZEAL
COSTS BIG SUM
Foreman of Grand Jury Pays
Part of Expert's Demand
Out of His Own. Pocket
GOOD WORK MUST GO OX
Is Determined to Have Ser
vices of Douglas Young
to Search City Records
Thomas P. Andrews' zeal as foreman
of the Grand Jury cost him $148 33 yes
terday. Deep down into his own
pocket he went and drew forth hard
won gold to make good the January
demand of Expert Douglas Young that
was held up by Auditor Baehr.
The total amount of the claim was
J258 33. Of this the city and county
paid $110. The Auditor was firm in re
fusing to allow more than $5 a day for
the expert, although the Grand Jury
had employed Young at a daily stipend
of $15. The warrant on the Treasurer
for the amount the statute designates
was accepted. The foreman, feeling
that an obligation rested upon him.
and havinpr a high regard for Young's
services, paid the shortage on the bill.
Andrews may have more bills to pay
out of his own store, but he declares
he is perfectly willing to pay them that
the good work may go on. He is a
fairly prosperous dealer in photo
graphic supplies and feels he can in
dulge the extravagance ot being a
grand juror. He is enthusiastic in the
work and wants a good go at the job,
he says, just to see what he can do for
the public weal.
A new deal has been made with Ex
pert Young. He is to prosecute his in
vestigations at the City Hall with un
abated vigor, but the Grand Jury has
agreed to pay him only $10 a day. With
his finger on the section in the code,
Baehr says he will allow half that
amount, or $5 per diem. Foreman An
drews promises to make up the
other $5.
It is possible that other members of
the Grand Jury will come to the fore
man's aid in the drain on his private
funds. But, in any event, explains An
drews, he win not, allow the work of
the expert to be interrupted. The out
lays are not of thj character that he
can embrace in his secret "personal
expense" bill to be paid out of the gen
eral fund on the order of the presiding
Judge.
CONSUL GENERAL GOODXOW
IS RETURNING TO ORIENT
Hurrying Back to Shanghai to Pre-
pare for His Successor. Who
Takes Charge in April.
John Goodnow, American Consul
General at Shanghai, arrived yester
day at the Palace Hotel from Wash
ington, whither he Journeyed a month
ago from the Orient for the purpose
of answering charges preferred
against him. While in Washington he
tendered his resignation to the Pres
ident to take effect in April and Is now
returning to China to straighten up
his official affairs preparatory to turn
ing his office over to his successor. In
discussing his- affairs yesterday Con
sul General Goodnow said:
1 went to "Washington and presentod to the
President my side of the case and was in
btruittd to return to my post In Shanghai. I.
however, iifcrir.eil the President that I was
anxious to get out of the diplomatic servi!?*
and thereupon presentrtl my resignation. It
was arranged that I should be relieved in
April. While in Washington I submitted to
the authorities a memorandum regarding Chi-
BT*e immigration, in which I suggested the
advi&ability of having our immigration officials
stationed at the various ports in China, where
they would be belter able to certify to the
character of Chinese desiring to gain admis
sion to tola country and in this manner greatly
facilitate the business of Chinese immigration.
There is â  great deal of dissatisfaction ex- ,
pressed among th? better class of Chines* over ;
the treatment accorded them upon their en- !
tran-:e to American ports. They object to be- \
ing herded together with coolies. Only re- j
cently the Viceroy sent 180 students, sons of
wealthy Chinese gentlemen, abroad to com- '
plete their stiuiies. and not one of them was
sent to the United States. When an explana
tion was asked from the Viceroy, who. by the
way, has a son in college in this country, he :
said the fathers of all the students hud ob
jected to their sons going to America because
of the treatment that would be accorded them
at the pert of entrance. I am not in (avor
Of coolie- iTimiifration, but btlievc that the
better classes ot Chinese. If they are to Iâ â 
permitted to enter this country a: all, should
be properly treatfd.
