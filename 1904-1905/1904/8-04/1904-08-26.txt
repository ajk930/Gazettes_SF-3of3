PHILIPSBURG, Mont., Aug. 25. â
A serious forest fire is in progress In
the vicinity of the old mining camp"
of Hasmark, between this city and
Granite, , where 'timber is very dense.
This" city is more or less i enveloped
in smoke as a result, but it is believed
there is no danser of the. fire reaching
Phillpsburg. The blaze is believed to
have been the result of carelessness
on the part of campers in the woods.

received to-day at the offices of Pres 1 
ident Elliott of the Northern Pacific
Railway from a woman missionary in
San Francisco telling of the con
version of a man formerly a, section
foreman on the Northern Pacific road
and his confession^ to her that for
several years he regularly reported
one man more than he had' on his
force in his payroll. When the check
arrived he : appropriated the amount.
The missionary says the man's con
version is so sincere that he wishes
to return; not only the money taken,
but wishes to observe the old Mosaic
law demanding one-fifth additional In
the form of smart money. The letter
asks that the records be gone over and
the amount ascertained. . -^

NEWPORT, R. I., Aug. 25. â There
was a ripple of excitement this morn-,
ing when it was announced at a gen
eral gathering in front of the Casino
Theater that Austen Gray and Miss
Alice Burnham had been married yes
terday at Providence and without any
member of the bride's family being
in the wedding party. It was only
on Monday that the announcement was
made that the engagement had been
broken by mutual- consent. . It was
said that this . was done at the. re
quest of the bride's father. ; , (
The -fair principal in this romantic
wedding, which was practically an
elopement, is the daughter of Mr. and
Mrs. William A. Burnham of Boston,
and the niece, on her mother's side, of

was here a few" weeks ago with her

The ; convention , was called to . order
SANTA CRUZ. Aug. .25/â Republi
canism pf the most, enthusiastic kind
marked the opening of the convention
here to-day. Every delegate seemed
bent upon showing his loyalty to the
Republican party in vociferous cheers
whenever the names of Roosevelt and
Fairbanks were mentioned, and pro
longed : applause frequently interrupt
ed the proceedings when the speakers
referred to matters of national impor
tance that have been fostered under
the sturdy policies of the great politi
cal party. â¢
V A. pleasant, cool day and plenty of
music, a well arranged programme and
a packed convention' hall were calcu
lated to inspire spirit and dash in'the
proceedings. .There was the usual
delay in opening the meeting, but the
ever, thoughtful "Jake". . Steppacher
made good his promise to keep things
'moving.and in the interim the Third
Artillery band played national airs.
The delegation .from the .Thirty
eighth District of 'San Francisco were
delayed by a slow train and appeared
on the scene bag and baggage Just in
time, to , take their seats and make
themselves felt Ion the floor in the
j discussions. George A. Knight of San
Francisco circulated among the dele
gates and was frequently greeted with
cries of "Knight, Knight, Oh, Mr.
Knight." \ Charles j Shortrldge, "with
the only plug hat. in the building,
loomed urÂ» in the foreground and kept
on the firing line near the press plat
form. The gallery showed a fair
sprinkling of ladies, but many of them
escaped during a recess on account of
the heat' that had became oppressive
in a place so near the ceiling. The
back of the hall was filled up to the
wall, and every seat on, the main floor
was occupied by . delegates.
' The attendance was . much -larger
than Â¦/ at . the Democratic convention
and !pTbved .that Republicans are al
ways; on' deck when , there ' is need*
for their; political services. .
Three notable Congressional district
conventions* were held to-day. The re
nomination of J. N. Gillette in, the
First, the selection of Duncan E. Â¦ Mc-
Kinlayto bear the Republican standard
to victory in the Second and the selec
tion of S. C. Smith of Kern to lead the
legions of the party in the Eighth,
evoked great enthusiasm. It was obvi
ous that these nominating conventions
registered the will of the people.
Henry T. Oxnard, Republican as
pirant â¢ for the high office of United
States Senator, seems to be the victim
of blundering management. According
to political gossip, Oxnard has three
managers and one of the three put him
in the contest to-day for Presidential
elector from the Eighth District and
the outcome was defeat. Many of the
politicians are throwing out the hint
that v the Senatorial aspirant was
Jobbed.
Frank H. Flint and George A.
Knight. -who are here, at this time de
rive no satisfaction from , the reverses
of Oxnard. but each inclines â¢ to the
opinion that the employment of one
political campaign manager is* a mis
take and the engagement of more than
one a- blunder. Oxnard is surely . the
victim of incompetent political man
agement, but this will not dampen his
ardor-as a Republican or diminish his
contributions to the campaign commit
tee. -. ..-. ."- .

SANTA CRUZ. Aug. 25.â The Repub
lican State Convention was opened to
day under auspicious circumstances.
The . Third United States Artillery
band provided the harmony, a clergy
man invoked the divine blessing and
the audience, standing, listened to the
singing of the "Star-Spangled Banner"
and "America." In the late Democrat
ic State Convention neither prayer Â«nor
patriotism was thought of and music
was not permitted. The enthusiasm
of the Republican delegations to-day
was . inspiring. The convention will
finish its. work to-morrow. '

WASHINGTON, Aug. 25. â The Bu
reau of Navigation of the Treasury
Department has answered in the af
firmative a question propounded by the
customs division whether United States
vessels engaged in trading between San
Francisco and Ancon, but touching at
Mexican ports, would be considered as
engaged in the foreign trade. Cate
gorically the reply was that so far as
Mexican ports are concerned such ves
sels unquestionably would be engaged
in the foreign trade.
â¢ This decision will give to steam ves
sels registered under the United States
laws, engaged in the foreign and coast
wise trade, a drawback on coal used
by them as fuel equal: to the duty
paid on the coal when imported into
the United States. An inquiry on thi3
point came to the department from

"I have been in the State militia since

only camp the militia has ever had: I
am proud of their appearance. The
steadiness of the men was remarkable.
They had the swing of regulars and
the State can well feel proud of them.
We are under great obligations to Gen

regulars for the interest they have
taken in these big maneuvers and- we
shall all look forward to a similar, en

A shrill- tire call from bugles in all

to their feet this, afternoon with great
alacrity. A big blaze was seen about' a
mile south of the camp of the provis
ional regiment. It was located in the
midst of a magnificent growth of pine
trees. About 2000 soldiers armed with
buckets, sacks and. shovels went to the
scene on a dead run and, after a hard
fight, succeeded in extinguishing the
flames, which for a time promised to
develop into a big conflagration.

of the blockade on the California-
Northwestern Railroad many carloads
of freight have accumulated on the
sidetracks of the road. Among them
are -several cars of wine on the Guer
neville branch. Tramps have broken
these cars open and helped themselves
to the wine. A watch was set over the
freight and last night a man was.de
tected in the act of breaking the seal
of one of the cars. When called upon
to stop he took to his heels and ran.
The guard took a shot at him and is
positive that the fleeing man was hit.

In reply to a question' by his Holi- !
ness regarding the condition of Ca
tholicism In America; the Cardinal
said that the Catholic church in Amer- j
lea had not any official relations with I
the state, but was in such a condition i
that it did not envy the position of the j
church in countries where official re- !
lations existed. j
To this statement the Pope replied:
"Because in the United States there
is true liberty and justice for all."
ROME. Aug. . 25.â Cardinal Satolli
went this afternoon to the Vatican to
visit the Pope for the first time since j
his return from his visit to the United j
States. Just as his Eminence arrived j
at the Papal apartment Pope Pius was
coming out to receive a body of Sardin
ian pilgrims who were in waiting. \
Upon seeing the Cardinal, however, i
his Holiness insisted upon re-entering
the apartments, saying that he was i
anxious to hear about "dear Ameri- j
ca" and to have confirmed by the ,
Cardinals the accounts of the cordial'
reception slveri' him, as told in his |
communications to the Vatican. His i
Holiness said he was greatly moved by
such manifestations and highly appre- j
ciated such a general disposition to- j
ward loyalty on the part" of the. people {
of the United States and expressed j
gTeat â¢ satisfaction at the reception
given to Cardinal Satolli, adding: |

"The objects for which the revolu
tion was started have entirely
changed," said Soler. '"The Govern
ment has fallen into the hands of a
few individuals, who are enriching
themselves at the expense of the peo
ple. . thus impoverishing a country
â¢which rossesFcs immense natural
â¢wealth and 700.000 inhabitants." .
BUENOS AYRES. Aul. 25.â The
Paraguayan Deputy Scnor Soler, who
started on Sunday last for Rio Janeiro
and other capitals to endeavor to se
cure the recognition of the revolution
ists by the various Governments, ar
rived in Buenos Ayres to-day. He said
that three-fourths of the population
of Paraguay sympathized with the rev
olutionists and that the further bom
bardment of Asuncion, the capital of
Paraguay, was abandoned only be
cause the Government Iiad taken the
cannon from the fortifications and
lodged them in front of the private
houses of revolutionary sympathizers.
Scnor Soler says that the number
of Government troops is wholly insuf
ficient to resist the attack on the revo
lutionists and that even the troops arÂ«?
confined to their barracks, owing to
the fear that they will desert.
The only armament at the disposal
of the Government, the deputy said,
consisted of 3000 old-style Remingtons
and 8000 antiquated rifles of other pat
terns, with some ancient cannon.
GIL.ROY, Aug. 25.â Carl Vandever,
who has just been sentenced to ten
years In Folsom, made a sensational
attempt to escape to-night at Pajaro.
Though he had an iron boot on one
leg, he : Jumped from the trajn upon
which he was being taken to prison
and crawled beneath the cars. Sheriff
Nat Stewart, in whose custody he was,
leaped after him and caught him be
fore he had gone ten yards.
Vandever is the same man who stole
55000 worth of diamonds from the Pal
ace Hotel in San Francisco two years
ago while employed there as a bell
boy. He was out on parole from San
Quentin Just thirty days when he broke
into and robbed three stores in Santa
Barbara.
A dng that curled in his master's
arms while doctors operated on a bad
injury to the leg of Clayton M. Ray
mond exclte'J the Interest of the at
tendants at the Receiving Hospital this
morning. The dog was yellow and of
low degree, with no particular breed,
but mostly just dog, but his sympathy
was almost human and all but spoken.
As Raymond writhed in pain the dog
lay in his master's arms on the oper
ating table and licked his hand. Being
small and refusing to be dislodged he
was allowed to stp.y and through the
trying ordeal, while the wound was
washed and dressed and the bones set,
the strange witness to a surgical oper
ation remained at his post.
Raymond is employed at the livery
stable of Kane & Daly at Webster and
Fourteenth streets and about 9 o'clock
this morning rode a horse out of the
stable en an errand. As he was turn
ing the corner at Fourteenth and Har
rison streets a peddler's wagon ran
into him and the pointed end of the
shaft struck Raymond Just below the
left knee. The blow broke both bones
in the leg and made a hde almost as
large as a dollar deep In the leg. Ray
mond was knocked off his horse, but
the man in the wagon drove rapidly
away without stopping to inquire what
injury he had done.
Bystanders summoned the police
patrol and the injured man was re
moved to the Receiving Hospital. The
dog followed the wagon and when Ray
mond was taken into the operating
room the dog followed. He eluded an
attendant who endeavored to put him
out and jumped up on the table, where
he curled up and lay still as a stone.
but watching every movement. "When
Drs. A. S. Kelly and O. D. Hamlin
came to treat the patient, they found
his companion, but as it seemed to be
a comfort to him they allowed the dog
to remain. Â¦â¢ *:â¢.:

The trophies to be offered visiting
Sir Knights at the Triennial Conclave
are wonderfully beautiful in design

fashioned their delicate lines.
Four of the most valuable of the
trophies will be exhibited in the sil
ver department of Shreve & Co.'s jew
elry store, where they were made.
Among these Is a silver loving cup
thirty-one inches high. The design,
is tasteful and the work faultlessly ex
ecuted. '
The "great clock of chivalry" is a
unique bit of the jeweler's art. The
shaft is a beautiful specimen of Cal
ifornia onyx. The metal parts are of
gold, silver and bronze.
The '"fortress of the Golden Gates"
is u purely emblematic piece embody
ing in its design all the cardinal em
blems of Templarism. It is made of
gold, silver and picked samples of
gold bearing quartz. Though this
piece is purely ornamental it is such
a "novel and beautiful conception that
the recipients may well be proud of it.
There is also a. ceremonial service
of silver, with emblematic decorations
and engraving. All these trophies will
be offered as prizes in' the competitive
drill of the visiting commanderies of
Knights Templar.

ENGINEER MEETS WITH
AWFUL DEATH IN* MINE
Unfortunate Man's Head Is Caught In
Machinery and His Life Is
Crushed Out.
SANTA ROSA, Aug. 25. â Jacob
Archambeau met a horrible death
Tuesday afternoon while engaged in
his work at the Wehrspon lumber
mill, north of Cloverdale. The acci
dent was not witnessed, but from the
position of the mangled body it is
conjectured that the man's head was
caught on a belt and drawn into the
machinery.
Archambeau was the engineer at
the mill and was prominent in the
lumber interests of this vicinity.

RENO, New, Aug. 25.â Cloudbursts
and washouts in Tonopah and along
the lines of the Tonopah and the Car
son and Colorado railroads are the most
disastrous in the history of these dis
tricts. On the Tonopah road all of the
track rebuilt after the last washouts
has been swept away, and it will be
a week at least before traffic can be
resumed. At Walker Lake, near Haw
thorne, the track is under three feet
of water for nearly four miles and the
lake has risen above its level from six
to nine feet-
Tonopah and Goldfields, which are on
the verge of starvation, are being tem
porarily relieved by the rushing in of
supplies via Crow Springs, Silver Peak
and Candelaria by v.agon trains, but
this is only temporary, as more than 5000
people must be fed in the different
c&;r.r>s. Food supplies at the camps
are practically exhausted. Flour, bacon
ard all staples have run out, and only
cannrd goods remain. Heroic measures
are bemg adopted, and with the re
sumption of stage lines relief is hoped
foe While the situation is critical and
much suffering must be endured, it
is hoped that the next few days will
bring about better conditions.
No lives have been lost.

SAILOR ON THE WARSHIP
DIXIE ALLEGES CRUELTY
Judge Wills, in charge of the Sac
ramento Valley Development Associa
tion's display, has, started a lottery to
attract visitors, but it is not a very
bad sort of a lottery. It is 3. guessing
contest as to the number of prunes
on the hide of the big prune bear
that stands in front of the display.
Each person who registers is enti
tled to a guess, which is written on
one of the Sacramento folders and
this is taken home for reference. The
prizes are large boxes of choice
prunes.
Judge Wills is looking for the woman
who a few days ago gazed on *he prune
plantigrade, with its gleaming teeth
and electric eyes, and then pinned on
its breast a card bearing the words, "A
boarding-house nightmare." He wants
to give her some high quality prunes
to take away the prejudice she seems
to have acquired against the fruit
through too long association with the
variety served their victims by land
ladies who want to acquire wealth too
fast.
"If I could only induce her to eat
Sacramento prunes," said Jud'ge Wills,
"that bear would take the shape of an
angel to her and her pessimism would
vanish forever. â¢ We Just discovered
the card in time, though, *4o prevent
another slump in prune prices."
The association has written to Judge
WJHs asking him to induce the foreign
newspaper correspondents at the fair,
to visit the Sacramento Valley before
returning home. They are promised
fine entertainment if they make the
trip. Â¦ v",\;
Two panoramic photographs of San
Francisco, taken from elevations, have
been received at that city's building
here and have be'fen put in prominent
places by Mr. Erwin. Visitors seem
much interested In photographs of
streets and buildings and seem to ob- :
tain a good idea of /what San Fran
cisco looks like from these reproduc
tions.
Only the direct statement on the
card that the' service was "designed
and worked" by "Mr." Eustace con
vinces some of the ladies, more skepti
cal than the rest, that the designing
a"hd execution were both done bv a
man. they thinking that the work was
surely done by a woman, even though
the design was of masculine origin.
Whoever he may be, the man who cre
ated the poppy design and so skillfully
worked it should send his photograph
to go with his creation, so the ladies
may know what sort of a masculine
person it is that is vying with them
in Battenbersr work.
Another register has been filled at
the San Francisco building. This
makes two in seven weeks. They con
tain 12,000 names. Only about oue per
son in ten registered, so it will be
seen there have been many visitors
to the building. They are becoming
more numerous each day.
There is always a crowd at the Cal
ifornia building. Many people who
do not start out to go there drop into
this building on their way to and from
various attractions in its neighbor
hood. While resting they look over
California albums and generally take
away some of the county literature to
peruse at home. Most of the coun
ties have ornately covered and hand
somely illustrated booklets for distri
bution at their booths and at the Cal
ifornia building.
UNKIND CRITICISM.
The handiwork of Eustace has a
prominent place In a glass case on the
floor of the San Francisco building and
that the service is the work of a man
is the marvel of lady visitors. They
admire the exhibit, but say it is not
complete without a photograph of the
man who worked it. The design of the
work has the California poppy as its
foundation. On each of the napkins
is a letter formed from poppies, the
twelve spelling "San Francisco." The
table cover bears larger poppies.
HARD tO CONVINCE.
Both began looking for something by
which the maker of the set could be
identified.
"Why she's not a woman at all," ex
claimed Wilcomb, holding up a placard
he had found In the case; "she's a
man."
The placard bore the name of.Alex
ander S. Eustace as the maker of the
set.

ING, WORLDS FAIR, ST. LOUIS,
Aug. 25. â When the goods for the San
Francisco building were being unpack
ed some weeks ago the men performing
the work opened a case that revealed
a beautiful Battenberg creation, which
they at first thought was a skirt for
some Spanish dancer on the Pike.
Twelve smaller pieces were uncovered,
though, and it was seen that the larger
was a table cover and the smaller ones
napkins. The set made up a beautiful
dinner service.
Charles P. Wilcomb 'and J. W. Er
win, the San Francisco committee's rep
resentatives at the building, who were
watching the unpacking of the exhibit
material, admired the beautiful work
very much.
"The woman who did that must have
a keen sense of the beautiful and a
needle touch as soft as a, butterfly's
tread," said Erwin in rapture.
"She's certainly an artist and knows
how the 'slender thread' to lead" to the
most pleasing ends," rejoined Wil
comb. "I wonder who she is?"

LONDON, Aug. 25.â England's at
tempt to arrest the supposed gravita
tion cf the British "West Indies toward
the United States was signalized to-day
by . & meeting of Influential business
men at Avonmouth, the port of Bristol.
Elr Alfred Jones said that Joseph
Charfberlain was heart and soul with
th* movement to restore prosperity to
the West Indies and bind their Inhabi
tants, to the mother country. How
â¢vÂ«r, this purpose could be effected
only if he received the co-operation o^f
Â¦teamshlp. dock* and railway com
panies.*
'"We axe carrying passengers and
freight from Europe to the West In
dies cheaper than ever before." said
Sir Alfred. "The dock people must
provide accommodations for the busi
ness and the railways must grant low
ratÂ«8 to facilitate distribution. Unless
Bristol responds we must take the
W.est Indian trade to another port that
is mere alive to Its own Interests and
toeener en the question of imperial fed
eration."
Elr Alfred was assured that Bristol
would .seize the opportunity to become
the distributing center of tropical fruits
and colonial foodstuffs. George Davies,
chairman of the Bristol Chamber of
Commerce, announced that the city
would epend Immediately 515,000,000 for

CHICAGO, Aug. 25. â Does unionism
pay? This question has been asked
many times by working men and
others. The last report of the treas
urer of the International Brotherhood
of Teamsters would indicate that
unions and unionism are excellent
things for those members who hap
pen to hold office.
Among the items of expense of op
erating the machinery of the great or

regular order of proceedings, when a
motion was made to go into secret
session.. This carried by a vote of
11 to 15. On the eighty-second ballot
the convention switched back to the
open ballot.
This outcome Is regarded as a. partial
victory for Lardner and a defeat of
the machine in the district.
C. "II. McKinney of Amador is the
choice of the Eleventh Assembly Dis
trict for Assemblyman.
The Third Senatorial delegation came
to town with the hardest problem to
solve of any that were presented at the
conventions of the regular session.
For more than five hours the dele
gates from Plumas, Sierra, Nevada and
Placer sat in the little stage room of
the convention v hall and cast ballot
after ballot without result. The flght
was on between W. B. Lardner of
Placer, F. M. Rutherford of Nevada
and J. B. Irish of Sierra. For fully four
hours of that time, consumed in tally-
Ing the votes that failed to change the
situation, Lardner seemed confident of
winning.
Lardner came in with the Placer
delegation of nine votes and the three
of Plumas. These he had solid at the
commencement' of the contest. Ruth
erford was backed by ten votes of Ne
vada, and Irish was supported by the
four delegates of Sierra.
Rutherford "was favored throughout
the fight by the Republican organiza
tion, while Lardner. was championed
by the Western Pacific* Railroad Inter
ests, tlfe extension of the lines of
which road will greatly aid both Pla
cer and Plumas counties. v.'L : .
Irish held his delegation to personal
friendship and his strength in that di
rection was well demonstrated by the
manner in which his delegation stood
by him.
The final result was not reached
until the eighty-fifth ballot was
counted at 11:40 o'clock, when it was
ennounced that Irish had won out.
Prior to call of the eighty-fourth
ballot the re. was a consultation herd,
during which Irish declared that if
he did not receive the votes of Nevada
ho would go over, to Plumas and
Placer. - .;._
' This settled -the, question and there
was only, one alternative, to elect him.
SevÂ«Â»ntv-two ballota were taken in tha
The vote was called for ar.il Contra
Costa voted its entire delegation of
eleven for Belshaw and Marin its eight
votes for Martinelli.
The Belshaw forces waited for a
motion to come from the Marin side
that the nomination be made unan
imous, but none came. Belshaw made
a short address and the convention ad
journed. Later some of the members
from the Marin delegation expressed
regret that the nomination was not
made unanimous. They asserted, also,
that, notwithstanding the contest that
had apparently divided the Ninth Sen
atorial District, the quarrel ended
when the s vote was cast, that their
loyalty to Republican principles would
predominate and that they would work
for the Republican 1 ticket from top to
bottom as earnestly for Belshaw as
for any other candidate.
â¢ LIVELY SENATORIAL FIGHT.
. Joha B. Irish of Sierra was nomi
nated for the State Senate in the Third
Senatorial District by a vote that stood
14 to 12 In- his favor, against W. B.
Lardner of Placer.
Judge W. S. Wells of Martinez placed
Belshaw in nomination. R; Harkinson
made the seconding speech and Contra
Costa gave way for the time to Marin.
T. B. Boyd placed Martinelli In nom
ination and Judge T. J. Lennon made
the seconding. address. Both Boyd and
Judge Lennon protested against Contra
Costa's action, stating that the custom
that should prevail gave them the
right to name the Senator for the com
ing term. But Belshaw's forces re
fused to yield.

SANTA CRUZ, Aug. 25.â The First

senting the counties of Del Norte, Trin

St. George Hotel to-day. J. T. Mat
lock of Tehama called the convention

imous vote:
SANTA CRUZ, Aug. 25.â A unique
tangle exists in the Twenty-ninth Sen*
atorlal District, comp'rlsing the coun
ties of San Mateo and Santa Cruz. San
Mateo, with its seven Votes, stands
solid for former Assemblyman Brown,
while Santa Cruz is divided, five of its
delegation favoring Christian Hoffman
,and four R. H. Rombo. According to
the call of the State Central Commit
tee, the twenty-ninth Senatorial Dis
trict Committee must meet to-morrow,
| but the Santa Cruz delegation claims
the right to adjourn over to September
17, the day set by the delegation.
Colonel Stone, chairman of the State
Central Committee, has directed that
the delegations meet to-morrow, but
at .a late hour to-night the Hoffman
faction of the Santa Cruz delegation
asserted that it would not enter the
convention. Another effort to straight
en out the tangle will be made to-mor
row morning.
A similar tangle is worrying the As
sembly district composed of Yuba and
Sutter counties. Under the apportion
ment of the delegates to the;6tate Con
vention, now in -session here, Yuba
County is entitled to six votes and Sut
ter four. l
The State Centttel Committee holds
that the delegates under this apportion
ment must meet here and nominate an
Assemblyman. Sutter balks at the sug
gestion and demands the right to re
elect six delegates to the Assembly dis
trict convention, that it may be on a
par with Yuba, instead of occupying
the position of a hopeless minority.
To-morrow will also see the settlement
of this affair. â¢

side was placed in nomination, but
withdrew, leaving Oxnard and Melrose
to fight it out. On rollcall Inyo failed
to respond, and after a wait of several
minutes it was announced that Uie
delegation would not cast a ballot.
The defeat of Oxnard caused a ripple
of excitement among the Southern Cal

nard workers somewhat for the reason
it was feared that the decision of the
convention might have some influence
upon his United States Senatorial as
pirations. - - . .
Chairman Johnson of Riverside, after
thedecision in the matter of an Elector,
appointed a committee on auditing and
named the following delegates: W. H.

The convention of the Eighth Con
gressional District was held Immedi
ately after the adjournment of the
State Convention. A. P. Johnson of
Riverside was elected chairman and A.
P. Johnson Jr., his son, was elected
secretary. Ward then placed Smith in
nomination and for at least a minute
the delegation could not be quieted.
Repeated cheers were given for Ward,
and in .nominating his friend from
Kern he made a stirring speech. He
said, in part:
While my home U nearly three hundred miles
away, from the district in which Mr. Smith re
fctdes, I have kept In touch with him In many
matters of local Interest and have watched hia
career with great interest. My friends here
wanted me to try for office, but when the time
came they were quick to urge that I. give way
to the wishes of the majority. This I have
done. *nd I wish to sajr that I believe my
friend from Kern County will go to the Con
greet of the United States. My friends here
are solid In the fight for his success and will
gather under the folds of his standard. Mr.
Smith, if elected, will be found working for
those 'of us who are of that" section of the
Â£tate that comprises the Eighth Congressional
District, and. In my opinion, he will recerve
the largest vote ever accorded a Republican
candidate in that section.
Smith was nominated by acclama
tion.
Duncan E. McKinlay was the reclpl-
Oranges and reclprpcity, together
with a slight difference of opinion re
garding a United States Senator, were
the features of an Interesting fight in
the convention of the Eighth Congres
sional District. San Bernardino Coun
ty won the day for S. C. Smith of
Kern, his opponent, M. L. Ward of San
Diego, withdrawing from the contest
for two reasons, first, because he knew
that a division of the votes caused by
the determination of San Bernardino
to cast thirteen for Smith and three for
himself insured a long fight; secondly,
because the two candidates have been
warm friends for years, and Ward de
termined to step aside.
Smith is accounted a Bard man and
Ward had shown a tendency to remain
neutral. The United States Senatorial
flsht was the bone of contention with
some of the delegation. After the mat
ter had been settled in caucus and a
decision reached that the fight for the
Senatorshlp should be set aside friends
of Smith declared that he was a strong
believer in combating national legisla
tion that^ might tend to injure the
orange interests In those counties of
the Eighth District that are largely de
pendent upon that industry. Some said
that Ward would not take ' a stand
against the administration policy in
advocating reciprocity In Cuba, but
finally the question came down to a
matter of friendship. Ward saw that
he was losing a little ground and
rather than make a fight he took down
his name.
SMITH IS NOMINATED.
I am one nf those who predict that Theodore
Roosevelt will be given a greater majority than
before on the 6th of next November, and Ms
triumph will not only ba a credit to hta grand
personality and American citizenship, but also
to all good and honest Republicans.
The attendance of the First Con
gressional District Convention was re
markably large, all the counties of the
extensive district being represented.
The demonstration in honor of Gillette
were enthusiastic in a marked degree.
WARD WITHDRAWS.
The Democrats have already commenced to
tell us what they are going to do. They al
ways start off with a flourish of trumpets and
a whole lot of noise, but I think that we will
be able to cope with them more effectually this
time than In the past. They tell us what they
mean to do In the First District. We will just
listen to it and that will be all. There is room
for a great deal of work In Congress In the In
terest of the First District, and. gentlemen. I
pledge you my word that I will leave nothing
undone to accomplish what we need, and I feel
confident that ny efforts will be successful.
PAYS TRIBUTE TO PRESIDENT.
I want to aay something about our great
President, Theodore Roosevelt, now that I am
with you all. He has shown himself to be a
man of action and a man who will do some
thing for the nation. When others had failed
he bravely put the Pan-American canal meas
ure through and therefore accomplished some
thing that the world's greatest statesmen and
commiesloners have been working; on for years.
It was through his great energy, his steadfast
ness and his will power that he achieved for
us one of the greatest triumphs of the age.
The Democrats nominated a man that fcoled
them. They fooled themselves, but they didn't
fool the people. We all know that. We nomi
nated a man who we know has done untold
good for his country, and we are not trying to
fool anybody.
Gentlemen: 1 have to thank you once more
for the great honor which you have again be
stowed upon me, and I assure you that I will
make a better nght than ever to uphold that
honor. I I say now that I hare always done my
best 'in the past while In the halls of Congress.
If I am elected again I will pledge myself to
work conscientiously, and I hope that my ef
forts will do much toward the betterment of
the great First Congressional District of Cali
fornia.
SANTA CRUZ, Aug. 25.â It looked
like an old-time revival meeting when
the delegates from the First Congres
sional District got together, shortly
after the adjournment of the conven
tion to-day and unanimously nominat
ed Hon. J. N. Gillette of Humboldt for
Congress to succeed himself. The del
egates were oqt in force and their
cheers resounded throughout the large
casino.
Dr. A. M. Gall of Amador was chosen
chairman and E. C. Deming of Placer
ville secretary. Several eloquent
speeches were made and the enthusi
asm of the convention was aroused.
Loud calls were made for Gillette and
he was escorted to the platform amid
the cheers of those present. He said:
When the national Republican convention
met in Chicago It but ratified the nomination
of a man who had been named by the entire
people of .the nation. He was not named by
a â¢â¢Â» ter i<* of politicians, but In compliance with
a demand of the people that could not be re
clFtvd even had the convention been of other
rrind. And when election clay arrives the
whole nation trl!l ratify again the action of
Ihe CTilcago convention by electing for Presi
dent our leader, Theodore Roosevelt.
A demonstration followed the.men
tion of Roosevelt's name. The dele
gates sprang to their feet and for five
minutes cheer after cheer rang through
the convention hall. When quiet came
Chairman Devlin concluded:

TRIBUTE TO McKJNLEY.
Experience has shown us that In the United
States there can be but two parties â the Dem
ocratic and the Republican. None other can
live. At each campaign these parties meet In
debate â the one the champion cf the afflrm
Â«tive side of the iFrjes. the other of the
negative. At the end of the campaign the
<5est!ny of the nation Is placed in the hands
Â¦ nf one or the other for the term fired by law
and theories are put into practice. Eight years
ago the Democratic party attacked the mone
tary ej>tem of the nation, declaring that Its
ralration depended upon the frÂ»Â»e and un
limlttd eclnag* of silver at the ratio of 18 to 1.
But the 'strong sense of the American people
repudiated the false doctrine.
Tour j-ears ago the Democrats chose tm
rfrlallsra as the issue. Again they were r<Â»
rudisted. What Is their JpFue to-Â«Jay? On
the one fide they have a platform represent
ing the thought of the radical element of the
I-arty. On the othÂ»r they have a nominee
thst represents th<Â» eonservatlx-e element â a
man that In h'.s speech of acceptance an
nounced thst although he is a Democrat he
â¢f a'.moet ae safe and sound as a Republican.
An effort 1? also made by the Democrats to
compare the merits of the candidates. We
will not *eek to detract from the merits cf
their standard-bearer, but I t*+\ when the
final Judgment is reached the Republicans will
have occasion to feel a laudable pride.
Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen of the Conven
tion: I desire to return my thanks to you for
the honor you hav* conferred upon me. A few
<tpy. ago the State convention of Democrats
arsembled 1n this beautiful city and the news
papers informed us that there were scarcely
tmte hundred delegates In attendance. As I
cast my eye over this rea of facet and as I
heard your voices lifted In song I realized
that the yptr't of Republicanism is abroad in
the land and that our forces will win a glorious
victory in November.
Devlin was frequently interrupted by
applause during his speech acknowl
edging the honor conferred upon him.
He /aid in part:
TV. H. Savage of Los Angeles second
ed the nomination and John S. Davis
of Amador added that on behalf of the
moyntain counties he was ready to
"favor Fa rramento, as Sacramento had
favored them."
The secretary cast the ballot for Dev
lin and he was declared elected, but
prior to this, a member of the San
Franeisro delegation created a mild
eensation by placing in nomination
Frank McGowan of San Francisco. Mc-
Gowan promptly arose and declared
that he did not desire the nomination
and had not the most remote idea of
LAUDS WORK OP PARTY.
Colonel Stone read a communication
on behalf of the citizens' reception
committee of Santa Cruz, which wel
comed the visiting delegates to the
city and assured them of a good time
during their stay. The programme of
amusements provided by the commit
tee was outlined and Miss Maude Hoh
man of Santa Cruz then Bang the
"Etar-Ppangled Banner," the audience
and delegates joining in the chorus.
The national anthem was encored and
the chorus repeated with a vengeance.
A double quartet followed with
"America" after which Assistant Sec
retary Wilson read the call for the con
vention.
The first business in order was the
election cf a temporary chairman.
Judge Hart of Sacramento rose and
was recocnized by the chair. "Gentle
men of the convention," commenced
Judge Hart, in placing Robert E. Dev
lin cf Sacramento in nomination, "I
want to say that Sacramento is again
looking; for something." Judge Hart
then raid a tribute to the ability of his
i-andidate and added that Sacramento
was 'poing to give something in re
turn." He drew an apt comparison be
tween the climatic evenness of the mild
summer day and the harmonious at
mosphere of the convention. He said
Devlin would speak well and act well
and preserve the unity of ideas that
Â¦was permeating the convention.
ThÂ» mention of Devlin's name was
the occasion for a demonstration that
lasted several minutes.

and appropriate prayer was offered by
Rev. F. Filleo. Chairman Stone then
delivered his address in a clear voice
prefaced his introductory remarks
by saying that he was obliged to go
back to an old rule that insured ac
curacy and he would therefore read
his SDeech. He said:
I have the excerlicnal honor of calling to
order a ttc r.d convention of Republicans as
sembled to nominate Presidential electors and
1 take the opportunity to say to you. the rep
resentatives of our party from a,ll sections
ri the State, that I highly appreciate the ap-
I iovsl by the Republican party of the manner
in which the campaign was conducted four
years ago. With the earnest help which I
feel Â«ure the Republicans of California are
prepared and willing to give the State com
mittee and county committees, California will
Â»Â£ow to the country that her confidence In
the grand old party is unshaken and prove
â¢It by again tiling a great majority for itÂ«
choeen candidates. The convention meeting
in iJ.if- beautiful and delightful city by the
Â»ea recalls vividly the convention of 1900.
Ilkr-wipe held in* Santa Cruz, and will remind
â¢>ou ail of the enthusiasm which followed the
indorsement of our beloved McKinley and his
no less distinguished associate. The subse
quent outpouring of loyal citizens on election
day ehould Incite us with a determination
upon leaving this convention hall to use our
best endeavors to maintain California's proud
ri&ee in the rack of loyal Republican States.
That California will send a messenger to Wash
ington with ten electoral vots for .Roosevelt
end Fairbanks I have no doubt, and that eight
representatives In Congress will be returned
from this State to the fifty-ninth Congress <te

There was a breezy session- of the
Santa Clara delegation on the indorse
ment of E. A. Hayes for Congress In
the Fifth, and there Is a deal of out
side rumor to the effect that harmony
did not prevail at the finish. Many
messages by wire from Saji Francisco
reached Santa Cruz a few minutes be
fore the caucus took final action.
The conference at Sea Beach Hotel
to-night was attended by Grow P.
Ayres of San Mateo, Max Goldberg.

man, Gustar Schnee, George H. Bahrs

T,hf> claims of R. H. Countryman and
D. W. Burchard were considered, but
it was the deliberate Judgment of tha
caucus that E. A. Hayes should ac
cept, and when the subject was again
presented to him for consideration he
decided on acceptance. At the con
vention to-morrow hi* views may bÂ«
frankly set forth.
It Is the opinion of politicians that
the 'labor forces will nominate a candi

nominee, and Wynn, the Democratic
candidate. v .i' \ "f,t '
"Gentlemen," said he. "if you expect
me to make an extended address I am
afraid that you will be sadly disap
pointed. There are times in a' man's
life when speech making is an Impos
sibility for him. This Is one of those oc
casions. I assure you. My heart is filled
to overflowing and the best I can say
is that I return to you my most gra
cious thanks, and I need hot add that
I will uphold this honored trust and do
my best for California and our grand
Republican administration."
Charles Hammond of Lake County
was unanimously elected an electoral
delegate from the Second District,
after which the convention adjourned
with three cheers for Roosevelt, ths
national administration and Duncan E.
McKinlay.
The election of McKinlay by a rous
ing majority is everywhere predicted.
The long controversy over the Con
gressional nomination of the Republi
can party in the Fifth District Is prac
tically ended. The district convention
will meet to-morrow morning and, aÂ«
predicted In to-day's Call, will nomi
nate K. A. Hayes of San Jose. The
determination to place the standard in
Hayes' hand was reached at a caucus
to-night.
Judge Burnett was followed by
Chairman Devlin of Sacramento, who
made a short but well-worded address
in seconding the nomination of McKin
lay. Thomas Boyd of Marin. Charles
Hammond of Lake. A. Hochheimer of
Glenn and J\ H. Steves of Napa also
spoke In favor of McKinlay.
McKinlay's speech of acceptance waa
a brief one. but it expressed th<Â» deep
est gratitude and admiration lor his
associates.
HAMMOND FOK ELECTOR.
And when he does get to Congress Mc-
Kinlay will be there to stay for awhile. We
will elect him this time, next tlm<Â» and on
several occasions. I know of no man who U
more qualified to foster our Industries, uphold
the policy of the great Republican party and
help our national administration than ia Dun
can E. McKinlay of Santa Rcsa.
McKinlay Is not a man who will make a
meteoric splurge on the floor of the House
as soon as he gets his sea*. He Is a man
who will be content to watch closely and take
advice from some of his more experienced
brethren, but when he gets ready to act you
may rest assured that he will act promptly
and with decision and when he doÂ«-s any
thing you will know that it la for the benefit
of both State and nation.

can be seen by the record he has made in the
office of the United States District Attorney
and In every other undertaking that ha* been
nia lot to be engaged in.
He started out In our midst as a humble
young man, without funds and without In
fluence. But he was a man whose cha/acter
Inspired all of us. Every man who knew him
loved and honored him. Therefore, it Is not
at all strange that he should have risen from
a humble position to one of the utmost Im
portance. We helped place him there and
we are going to place him In Congress In the
same manner.

of leading men from the other dis
tricts, all Interested in the welfare of

W. T. Price of Sonoma was chairman
of the convention and A. Hochheimer

principal nominating speech. The

ST. PETERSBURG, Aug. 25. â The
Russian authorities decline to for
mally reply to the statement present
ing the Japanese side of the Ryeshi
teini affair given ' to the press on
August 21. Nevertheless, the Rus
sian view of the Japanese statement
was reflected by an official of the For
eign . Office. He declared that the
statement was an attempt by general
assertion to cloud and distract atten
tion from the issue raised by the Rus
sian protest, namely, that Japan had
directly violated tfie~ neutrality of
China by entering the harbor of
Chefu, and, in- contempt of every
principle of international law, com
mitting a hostile act against a Rus
sian vessel which had' been disarmed
by the power exercising the sov
ereignty there and the protection of
whose sovereignty she was enjoying.
That, in a nutshell, the. official de
clared, was the issue, upon .which
Japan could not escape by unsup
ported countercharges that Russia
v.'as first responsible for the violation
of Chinese neutrality.
Thus Declares a Russian Official
Anent the Ryeshitelni Affair.
JAPAN EVADING THE. ISSUE.
TOKIO, Aug. 25. â Five steamships
and three torpedo-boat destroyers
emerged from Port Arthur yesterday
morning, and began the work of
clearing away floating " mines. At
twenty . minutes past 6 o'clock in the
evening â¢ a two-funneled torpedo-boat
destroyer struck a mine two miles off
Liaoti Promontory and sank immedi
ately. Five minutes later a second
destroyer, with four funnels, ran
against another floating mine, which
exploded. This second vesel was at
or.ee surrounded by other Russian
ships and towed into Port Arthur,
the entire flotilla accompanying her.
These occurrences were seen from
various Japanese watch towers. The
Japanese criser Hashidate wit
ncf-aed the explosions.
Â«. The action of the Russians in at
ttmpting to clear the channel of. mines
indicates the' intention of the fleet
again ,to sally from Port Arthur.
TWO WAR CRAFT HIT MINES.
One Riisslnn Destroyer Sunk and An
other Badly Damaged.
4:30 o'clock in the morning of that
day the Japanese began an assault
upon Ugtovol Hill and opened a fierce
bombardment on the fortifications*
north, and east fronts with their bat
teries on Wolf Hill. The Japanese, he
added,, were digging trenches in front
of Suishen and along the entire Lun
khe (Tiger) Valley.
The fact that the Port Arthur squad
ron is already so crippled and scat
tered has' greatly reduced its Impor
tance as a tactical factor in the eyes
of th-2 authorities here. Accounts of
the misfortune to the battleship Se
vastopol and of the sinking of the
cruiser Novik are allowed to be ex
tensively printed, and it appears that
the balance of sea pov.er in the East
is thoroughly upset, pending thte ar
rival of the Baltic squadron In Oriental
waters.
Nothing can be ascertained here re
garding the reports from Tokio of the
sinking of two Russian torpedo-boat
destroyers at Port Arthur.
ST. PETERSBURG. Aug. 26.âTh
latest information from the front is
summed up In yesterday's dispatch
from Chefu, showing that the Japa
nese, in the assaults on Port Arthur
on August 21 a mT 22, were again re
pulsed with heavy" losses. Despite tht
assertion made in Tokio that all the
attacks so far on the fortress have been
merely preliminary to a grand infantry
assault, the feeling grows here that
the ferocity of the; repeated attacks
and the defeats must be gradually dis
sipating the energy of the besiegers,
and that the Japanese may find after
all that "they have broken their teeth
on the stones of Port Arthur." -
From Port Arthur.
RUSSIAN HOPE REVIVES.
Slav Nation Reassured by the Reports
"Our casualties were two officers
and thirty-eight men killed and twen
ty-one officers and 286 men wounded,
fifty of them severely.
"Captain Boyeman, despite severe
wounds, remained for twenty hours on
the bridge until the battleship entered
port. Our vessels are belns repaired
by their own and the dock yard ap
pliances. In the absence of Rear Ad
miral Withoeft I have assumed c6m
mand of the Port Arthur squadron."
"On August 21 a cruper of the
Suma type bombarded that part of the
cruiser showing above the water.
"My casualties on the 10th were two
sailors killed and a doctor wounded and
on the 20th two sailors killed and fif
teen slightly wounded."
The Emperor has received from Rear
Admiral Prince Outomsky a telegram
bearing a Port Arthur date, in wnich,
after briefly describing the sortie of
the Port Arthur squadron on August 10
and its engagement wltn Vice v Admlral
Togo's ships, the Admiral sayB:
"At 7:30 o'clock, when the Cesare
vitch left the line with damaged steer
ing gear and signaling 'Admiral trans
fers command," as I had two masts
broken and all means of signaling by
day cr night damaged on the Peres
viet. I' displayed the signal 'Follow me/
but I imagine that all the ships were
not able to distinguish it. As my ves
sel lost manv killed and wounded and
as the armament, hull and electric ap
paratus were seriously damaged, I de
cided to return to Port Arthur. The
Ironclads Retvizan, Pobieda, Poltava,
Sevastopol and Ccsarevitch / accom
panied me, the Cesarevitch Deing the
last in linp.
"We wer-t at-an average speed, but
owing to the darkness and to repeated
torpedo attacks, which obliged us from
time to time to change our course, our
vessels dispersed and at dawn the Ret
vizan, Sevastopol, Peresviet, Pobieda,
Poltava and Pallada. with three tor
pedo boats, were at Port Arthur.
ST. PETERSBURG. Aug. 25.â The
Emperor has received from Viceroy
Alexieff the following repwt of the
commander of the cruiser Novik, which
was sunk at Korsakovsk. island of
Saghalien, after a fight with the Jap
ane.sj protected cruisers Chitose and
Tsushima:
"At the end of the fight of August
10. in which the Novik sustained three
holes below the water line, she passed
through the enemy's ships with the
cruiser Askold. I lost sipht of the lat
ter, owing to the log and to the delay
caused by repairing the engines.
"On August 11 I entered Kiaochou to
coal and left there on August 12. round
ing Japan for Vladivostok.
"On August 20 the Novik reached
Korsakovsk. At 4 o'clock on the same
day I sighted an enemy's cruiser and
put to sea and engaged her. After
forty-five minutes' fighting the Novik
had three holes below her water line
and two above, and the steering gear
was damaged. The Japanese cruiser
ceased fighting and began telegraph
ing.
"By the end of the engagement only
six of our boilers were in good order,
nnd this fact, added to the damage to
our steering gear, compelled me to re
turn to Korsakovsk to examine our
condition.
â¢'In doing this I Intended to put to sea
again at night, but, finding it Impossi
ble to repair the rudder and in view
of the approach of several of the
enemy's vessels, I decided to sink the
cruiser in shallow water. The crew
and stores were conveyed on shore.

i meted out to all, and that in his opin-
I ion the cases cited hardly bore out the
! serious contention of , discrimination
j against British shipping. The delega
| tion must remember that the belllger
j ents had rights as well as neutrals,
j and the Premier added:
| "We ourselves may have to appeal
j to the law of nations to protect our
i rights as belligerents, and in the lnter
> ests of our own self-DreservÂ«tion we
I may be" obliged to ignore the interests
.of neutral shippers engaged in the
risky though legitimate operation of
carrying contraband of war."
j The Premier appealed to the depu
j tation in the interest of themselves
! and of the world at large to view both
j sides of the question and to approach
! it in a spirit of moderation.
The Novoe Vremya says that the
peasants are remitted arrearages of
taxes to exceed $68,000,000, adding:
"Nobody is forgotten. Provision is
made for soldiers and sailors' orphans,
the legalizing of unauthorized mar
riages and for amnesty, even for the
Finns, who are relieved of a quarter of
their arrearages of taxation. The man
ifesto rewards the brave soldiers and
sailors by abolishing corporal punish
ment in the service, and rewards the
engineer officers .of the navy by giving
them substantive rank."
ST. PETERSBURG, Aug. 25.â The
list of christening honors is very large,
containing plentiful recognition of the
army and all departments of state ex
cept the navy, where the honors are
practically limited to the appointment
of Admiral Jessen and Captain Sabich
as imperial aides-de-camp.
The conferring of the high order of
St. Alexander Nevsky on Foreign Min
ister Lamsdorff and the Order of the
White Eagle on Witte, president of the
Council of Ministers, is regarded as
significant and as indicating the com
plete return to favor of the Emperor's
conservative counselors.
"Most assuredly," said the Premier,
"should the volunteer, fleet steamships
attempt further captures, which I do
not think they will, no such captures
will be recognized by us or by the Rus
sian Government."
Balfour carefully , reviewed the
cases of alleged differential treatment.
He, said there was no evidence as yet
that fair r treatment ; would not. be
Members of the deputation also
stated that it was notorious that ship
ments of contraband of war had been
made from Antwerp and Hamburg,
while insurance rates from those and
from French ports were much lower
than from English ports in the ratio
of five shillings to twenty shillings.
In h!s reply Balfour said that Em
bassador Benckendorff has advised
the Foreign Office here' that the
cruiser that overhauled the Brit
ish steamer Comedian off the
southeast coast . of Cape Colony
on August 21 probably was the Smo
lensk, in which case her action could
be explained only on the supposition
that the orders telegraphed to her .by
the Russian Admiralty, after the Ma
lacca affair, failed to reach her com
mander. The Russian Government,
therefore, proposes to take renewed
measures to see that the, Smolensk re
ceives orders to cease the examination
of neutral shipping. It was explained
that before leaving for the south the
Sevastopol and Smolensk took on board
a large supply of coal, thus enabling
them to keep at sea without visiting
a port where orders could be delivered.
Russia had asked for the co-operation
of Great Britain in getting orders to
the Smolensk. This was gladly agreed
to and the British Government ordered
two cruisers to attempt to deliver the
instructions from Cape Colony. Russia
was seeking to carry out her agreement
In good faith and no complications
were exDected.
FURTHER SEIZURES UNLIKELY.
Members of the Chamber of Com
merce deputation quoted the cases of
the Portland and Asiatic line steam
ship Arabia and the British steamship
Calchas. The former was allowed to
proceed, while the latter was still at
Vladivostok, and the members pointed
out that both .cases were equal so far
as the nature of the cargoes was con
cerned. The cases of the Peninsular
and Oriental Company's steamship
Malacca and .the Hamburg-American
line steamship Scandia also were
quoted. Each of these vessels had
ammunition on board, but the Scandia
was allowed to proceed.
The deputation next referred to the
sinking of the British steamship
Knight Commander and the German
steamship Thea by the .Vladivostok
squadron and pointed out that com
pensation had been paid in the case of
the Thea, while it had not everi been
promised In that of the Knight Com
mander.
Prior to receiving the delegation,
Balfour, during the day, had been bus
ily engaged in connection with the
question which had been raised in re
gard to Russian treatment bf British
shipping. After giving a number of
private interviews the Premier held an
important meeting at the Foreign Of
fice to which representatives of. the
intelligence department of the War Of
fice, the Admiralty, the, Foreign Office
and the Board of Trade were sum
moned.
Balfour said that before making a
definite statement he desired to hear
evidence tending to show preferential
treatment by Russia, which, was a
most important phase of the situation
and concerning which the Government
had no conclusive information, and to
learn of any concrete examples of dif
ferential treatment by Russian officers
and Russian prize courts, which, he
said, would be carefully considered.
NUMEROUS CASES CITED.
At the same time the meeting pre
pared a letter addressed to Lord Lans
downe, the Foreign Minister, in which
it was stated that the continuance of
the present situation was having a dis
astrous effect on shipping and was
causing Irreparable damage to the
whole course of trade with Japan and
the Far East. The letter further said
that the commercial community would
welcome any measure, however strin
gent, that might be necessary to place
British commerce on the same footing
with that of other non-belligerent coun
tries in the treatment of so-called con
traband of war.
This extraordinary statement was
made when the Premier, by appoint
ment, received a deputation of the
London Chamber of Commerce. The
deputation was appointed at a meeting
held earlier in the day by the China
and East India section of the chamber,
which was attended by representative
ship owners in trade in the Far East,
and at which the following resolution
was passed:
"The meeting of the members of the
Londc-n Chamber of Commerce con
cerned in trade with the Far East views
with grave apprehension trie" continued
uncertainty of the position of British
trade and shipping with regard to what
constitutes contraband of war, as in
terpreted by the Russian Government.
The meeting trusts that his Majesty's
Government will take such immediate
steps as will afford all reasonable pro
tection to British shipping and to in
sure to- it the same degree of immunity
from vexatious stoppages and exam
inations as is apparently enjoyed by
shipping of other nationalities."

* 'CHEFU. Aug. 26.â According to in
formation from trustworthy sources
the p'resent situation at Port Arthur is
as follows:
Eastward from Takushan to the ,
'VTclt Mountains the country is occu
pied by the Japanese, who have mount
ed S00 heavy guns, besides field artil
lery. The guns include ten six-inch
quick firers, manned by a naval brigade,
and also weapons brought from the
principal ports of defense in Japan.
â¢ They are able to shell the town.
The Russians, besides heavy guns.
feave constantly at work hundreds of
light pieces and quick firers.
To the westward of the Etzshan fort.
Vhich has been captured, a road leads
to the parade ground, but the Japanese
infantry is unable to advance on ac
count of the land mines. From the
heights the Japanese are able to shell
c the eastward forts, which are thus
caught between twp fires. The Pigeon
Bay fort has been taken, bet the Liao
fh'an fort is still in the hands of the
Russians. . -- .
To the north the Japanese are at
Paliencheng. Their infantry and ad
vanced guards have pressed several
times berond the inner forts, but have
'been repulsed.
There are Japanese spies In Port Ar
thur- engaged in cutting electric con
nections to the land mines. The be
eiegers cannot advance eastward un
til the forts are silenced. The capture
of Etzshan is regarded as opening a
successful way to the westward. The
ettack is being pressed on all sides sim
ultaneously and the Russians are flght
lm? inch by inch.
Some Chinese, whose Junk left Port
Arthur eighteen hours ago, confirm the
capture of Etzshan. The whole of the
west coast of the peninsula is now oc
cupied by the Japanese, who examine
all Junks leaving the harbor. They
maintain a heavy shell fire, making
the position of the ships in the harbor
untenable.
The fighting Is continuous and the
belligerents are unable to bury their
dead. Hence the effluvia from the
decomposition of bodies is making life
in the town unbearable.
The harbor is described as boiling
with the splash of falling shells. It is
estimated that 3000 projectiles have
been hurled in within three days.
Never was there such a line of en
trenchments and wire entanglements as
that constructed near the town. The
Russians are confident and are betting
5<v>o rubles to 1000 that the place will
not fall. Their agents are arranging
for the running of provisions through
th*> blockade.

of little Stella Terrill, aged 13 years
and a deaf and dumb pupil at the State
Institute for the Deaf and the Blind.
The. child is now desperately ill with a
baffling affection of the eyes and the
doctors In attendance hold out little
hope for ultimate recovery.
The disease manifested itself by a
pairlful swelling that has obscured the
vision 'and it- is .against this growth
that the physicians are .fighting. Two
nurses: are constantly at the child's
bedside and every human -aid has been
called to help the stricken girl.
The child's 'home is in Oroville and
she, has been an inmate of the State
institute for three years. . Just before
returning to the Institute from her va
cation ten days ago the disease be
trayed its presence. She jvas brought
to Berkeley and placed immediately
under the cafe of Dr. Thomas. C. Mc-

OAKLAND, Aug. 25. â Among the no
table engagements of the year is that
of Clarence Elwin Qrowell, Alameda
County's young Court Commissioner,
and Miss Adelaide M. Samuels of San
Francisco. The , announcement of his
approaching marriage will be received
with. surprise by Mr. Crowell's many
friends in Oakland, who had almost
relegated him to the ranks of the con
firmed bachelor. His sudden change of
front, however, is not surprising to
those who know Miss Samuels, who is
a charming girl, cultured 'and refined,
whose natural cleverness has been en
hanced by travel here and abroad.
She Js a daughter of Frederick S.
Samuels, vice president of the Oceanic
Steamship Company and confidential
secretary to John D. Spreckels. The
family is well known socially in San
.Francisco and this summer, entertained
several house" j partfes* In 'Ihe^ family's
country homei a very artistic bungalow
in Carmel-by-the-Sea: Miss Samuels
is a graduate of Mills College.
"Clarence Crowell is one of the clever-'
est yotmg attorneys on this side of the
bay. After graduating from the Oak
land High School he took ;. the law
course at the State University, and
since his admission to the bar has risen
steadily in his profession, being for' two
years Assistant City Attorney,-.,' and
now one of the attorneys for the Pub
lic Administrator. He has also been
prominent in municipal and political
affairs and is at present chairman^f
the Republican County Central Com
mittee. Active in Masonic circles, he is
also a popular Elk and member of the
Nile Club, being a director of the latter
organization.
Although no date has been set for the
wedding. It, will take place before the
end of the year at Miss Samuels' home
on Eddy street. Oakland will, of
course, be the future home of Mr. 'and
Mrs.. Crowell, who *wlll be a decided
acquisition to the local, smart set.

tendance at the public schools.
Is the opinion ol Superintendent of
Schools J. W. McClymor.ds, based upon
reports of enrollment! rent to his of
fice from the several schools in . the
city. The euperintendent finds that of
the hundreds of school children who
were temporarily deprived of their
Â¦eats because of failure to comply
with the vaccination law there are
comparatively few not registered.
Concerning the situation Superin
tendent McClymonds said to-day:
r*jrurÂ»Â« at hsnd enow that during; the week
several hundred children have been vaccinated
tnd have resumed thÂ».ir accustomed p!aceÂ« in
the fchoola. The -*rcentase of new pupils.

INITIAL MEETINGS.
Chairman Stearns said that Council
man John L Howard had prepared for
public use a valuable paper on" the
bonds, showing in minute detail their
effect ' upon "municipal taxation. That
paper will - be .- read at- the opening
mass meeting, which, will be held be
fore September 1. The federation cam
paign committee, composed of H. B.
Belden. chairman; J. C. Bullock, Pro
fessor A. B. Feight, George Samuels
and P. M. Fisher, will meet Saturday
afternoon to arrange this meeting. At
that time a committee of twenty-one
members, three from each ward in the'
city, selected from improvement clubs,
will be named to carry. on the ward
work.
â¢'The carrying of these bonds means
more to the city of Oakland than any
of us can estimate. There is no way
to look at this issue but as one that
will put. Oakland to the fore front as
a city of energy, progress and devel
opment. It means that it will place us
where we belong, in . the front rank
of progressive communities of Califor
nia and of the Pacific Coast. To ac
complish this result we need to work,
but I am gTatiSed that the spirit is
so strong for bonds now that we shall
not have. nearly so much to do as. we.
should have had to accomplish, a few
weeks ago. Nevertheless, Work . and
plenty of it is needed."
Edward Stearns, president of the
Progress Federation, was chairman of
the meeting. In opening the confer
ence. President Stearns said:
Representatives from all the Improve
ment clubs, the Board of Trade, Mer
chants' Exchange, Letter Carriers' As
sociation, Alameda County Real Estate
Association and other organizations in
cluded in the Progress Federation,
opened the campaign for bonds to
night at a meeting held at the Board
of Trade rooms in the Masonic Temple
building. General plans for a presen
tation of the bonding project to the
voters of the city were arranged. These
cover a central mass meeting to be
held at once and to be followed by
ward and district meetings throughout
the city under the direction of improve
ment clubs and other organizations.
Along the same line methods for
reaching individual voters by a house
to-house canvass, the dissemination of
suitable literature, the opening of pro
posed park sites to public Inspection,
the co-operation of members of the
City Council and the press at public
meetings and the raising of a cam
paign fund were freely discussed. Out
of the debate came the mappfhg out
of definite lines of work, by which
the voters in the city shall be brought
into a close personal touch with every
Item in the propositions that will be
balloted upon September 27.

Tuesday's unexpected rain played
havoc at several interior county points.
The lightning accompaniment killed a
horse near Centerville. owned by M.
Silva. The animal's body was found
charred in a field.
One hundred and fifty acres of hops
at the Pleasanton Hop Yards, owned
by Lilienthal & Co." of San Francisco,
were laid flat by the rain. The grow
ing hops were so heavily weighted by
the dampness that the'strings support
ing the vines broke from the poles,
leveling the hops and causing much
mildew.'
Softening by rain of the ground upon
which a large warehouse of the Hunt
Bros, cannery . at 'Haywards stood,
caused the collapse of the floor, which
was weighted with 50,000 to 75,000 cases
of packed fruit. Thousands ef cases of
fruit were dumped into a mass of bent,
broken and damaged tins. Until the
mess 'has been cleared an estimate of
damage cannot be made. The loss will
depend upon the condition in which
the cans are found.
Miss Hoffman was awakened early
this morning 1 by an unusual sound com
ing from the lower floor of the house.
Without entertaining any thought of
danger she proceeded cautiously down
stairs to investigate. That she might
meet a burglar on the way did not oc
cur to her, but she met one when she
opened the kitchen door. There stood
a man wearing a mask. There was
plunder in his hands, and he was about
to escape. As soon as he saw Miss
Hoffman, however, he dropped his
booty and ran out of the rear door.
Miss Hoffman screamed and neighbors
responded, but by that time the bur
glar had found a safe hiding place in
the university grounds.
Mrs. Wilson did not see the burglar
that tried to get into her home on Uni
versity avenue, but he left enough
"Jimmy" marks behind to show that he
meant business. Mrs. Wilson was with
her children when she heard a rasping
at the window. She lay still for fifteen
minutes to be sure that there wan
really some one trying to get in. When
the burglar's attempt to raise the win
dow finally confirmed her fears she
raised such a scream that even the
most intrepid burglar would have been
put to flight, and this one ran for his
life. Neighbors were aroused In time
to see. the fellow getting out of the
yard, but it was then too late for pur
suit and there were no police around to
help.
That the women of Berkeley are bet
ter than policemen was again demon
strated last night when two of them
frightened two burglars in' different
tarts of town.- -The heroines who chal
lenged the prowlers of the night and
put them ' to flight are Miss Estelk*
Hoffman, daughter N of Mrs. Mary T.
Hoffman of 2230 Barrow street, and
Mrs. James Wilson, wife of a clerk in

FAIR 'VISITORS AT ESOPLS.
In connection with Bogart's coming
engagement at the Tivoli and the in
terest the news has aroused, it may
not bÂ«? amiss to recall the criticisms of
the New York Musical Courier upon his
singing at the Waldorf-Astoria concerts
recently:
"Andrew Bogart's voice and style are
so unique that he impresses one at once
as something unusual even as good
singers go. His voice possesses powers
of expression far beyc-nd the ordinary
and to this gift he adds that of a true
dramatic instinct and impulse which
succeeds in arousing the listeners' in
terest at once and. better yet. in re
taining it to the end.
Bogart's debut at the Tivoli will
mark his first appearance on the op
eratic stage. He is a native son of
California and takes great pride in the
fact that he received his musical edu
cation in America. He has traveled in
Europe extensively and has had a
number -of offers to appear in opera.
While be was in the East recently
Henry W. Savage offered Bogart lead
ing roles in .his opera company and
while in England he eang at Queen'3
Hall concerts and at Steinway Hall.
He has also sung extensively in the
drawing-rooms of England's nobility
and made several concert tours through
the Pacific States.
This announcement of the engage
ment of Bo?art will be gladly re
ceived by thousands of San Fran
ciscans to whom he is well known
and to whom his upward career
has been a source of satisfaction. No
singer of this city has ever numbered
more friends and that his operatic de
but should be made in his home city
augurs happily. The character he will
interpret in Â¦"The Serenade" is that of
the outlaw, "Lopez." first sung here by
William Philp, the English tenor, then
a member o- the Bostonians.
An announcement that will arouse
local interest is that which has just
escaped from the "secret room" at the
Tivoli. It is to the effect that Andrew
Begart has been engaged by the man
agement to sing one of the principal
roles in the forthcoming revival of
Victor Herbert's great comic opera
"The Serenade." which is booked to
succeed '"The Toreador" at the famous
musical theater.
Tivoli Secures Andrew
Bogart as Lopez in
"TheSerenade."

force of bandits. Captain H. Barrett
of the constabulary was killed in the

SALT LAKE CITY, Aug. 25.â After
a bitter all-day fight John C. Cutler
of Salt Lake was nominated for Gov
ernor by the Republican State conven
tion to-day, on the second ballot. The
fight for the Governorship was a three
cornered one between Governor Heber
M. Wells, now serving his second term
in that office; James H. Hammond,
present Secretary of State, and John
C. Cutler, a merchant of Salt Lake, and
absorbed the attention of the delegates
to the exclusion of the rest of the
ticket. Hammond withdrew after the
first ballot. The second ballot stood:
Cutler 233. Wells EEL
Charges that church influence was
being used in favor of Cutler were free
ly made by the adherents of Wells and
Hammond. Indirectly the fight for the
United States Senatorshtp in the Leg
islature next winter was brought Into
to-day's contest. Senator Smoot. who i3
one of the twelve ai>ostles of the Mor
mon Church, being an open and active
supporter of Cutler, whiie Governor
Wells was helped in his campaign by
Senator Kearns. During the balloting
the feeling between the Wells and Cut
ler adherents broke forth several times,
but charges of church influence, which
were expected to be made in the con
vention hall, did not materialize, s
The ticket was completed as follows:
Secretary of State. C. S. Tingey: Jus
tice of the Supreme Court. D. N.
Straup: State Treasurer, James Chris
tiansen: Auditor. James A. Edwards;
State Superintendent of Schools. A. C.
Nelson: Attorney General. M. A. Breed
en; Presidential electors, A. W. Wade.
H. P. My ton and D. H. Cannon; Con
gressman, Joseph Howell (renomi
nated).
The Utah delegation resented this
with much bitterness and the contro
versy was acrimonious in the extreme.
James F. Callbreath of Colorado de
livered an address that presented the
claims of Denver in a straightforward,
concise manner.
"Every city stands for something and
it is so recognized by all the world.
When Denver is mentioned to any
body he or she thinks of the mining
industry with the first thought. When
Salt Lake is mentioned, the man or
the woman thinks of â some other in
dustry.
"Everybody who hears the name of
Denver or Colorado 'knows what it
stands for. In Denver every man is
entitled to more than one mine; in Salt
Lake he is entitled to more than one â
proxy."
Lafe Pence of Lewiston. Idaho, for
mer Congressman from CÂ»Jlorado, was
the next speaker and spoke in behalf
of Denver. In the course of his re
marks he adverted to the Mormon
problem and Instantly the convention
was thrown into a state of Intense ex
citement that permeated the proceed
ings of the remainder of the afternoon
and engendered a bitterness that has
not before been manifested.
The remark by Pence that started the
turmoil was this:
PORTLAND, Aug. 25.â Great bitter
ness was aroused at the afternoon ses
sion of the American Mining Congress
by the injection of the Mormon ques
tipn Into the discussion anent the se
lection of permanent headquarters for
the congress. The sentiment that Utah
will solve the Mormon problem in her
own way and that it will be settled to
the satisfaction of the country was
hotly indorsed, judging by the applause
cf the largest assembly that has at
tended the sessions of the congress. A
: controversy started by Lafe Pence of
Lewiston, Idaho, a former member of
; Congress from Colorado, developed into
a debate that It is now believed will re
sult in the postponement of the selec
tion of the permanent headquarters for
: one year or perhaps longer.
President Richards, in calling the
"convention to order for the afternoon
session, made an appeal to the dele
gates to approach the question in all
seriousness and be prepared to give it
their most careful consideration. He
characterized it as the most important
question that the organization had ever
been called upon to decide.
John Dern of Utah promptly took the
floor and moved that Salt Lake be made
the permanent headquarters of the
congress.
Before he had taken his seat James F.
Callbreath Jr. of Denver was on his
feet with a motion to amend by sub
stituting Denver for Salt Lake. Colp
nel John H. Crawford of Oregon start
ed in to spÂ»ak In advocacy of the rec
ommendation of President Richards,
but was ruled out of order on the point
being raised by H. S. Joseph of Utah.
Judge O. W. Powers of Utah then took
the platform and delivered an address
in support of the claims of Utah's cap-
Jtal city. In the course of his remarks
he pledged to the congress the hearty
support of-all classes of Utah citizens.
Jew, Gentile. Mormon, and in the best
way made reference to the good will
Â¦with which the Mormon church has ex
tended the privilege of using its assem
bly room to the great congress until
such time as its building is completed.

to be an ordinary toothbrush, which
the Shah regards as one of the great
est curiosities. And everywhere about
the palace are cats. The Shah has a
specimen of every kind Of cat of which
he has ever heard and there is hardly
a country which Is not represented in
the feline army which it is the pleasure
of the Persian ruler to maintain. . If
he hears of any sort of a cat which Is
new to him he Immediately gives or
ders that It be bought, no matter what
the price Is, and it Is possible that some
ordinary American tabby may be at
this moment luxuriating at the Shah'a
expense. To take care of this as
semblage of cats there is a corps of
well-paid officials. The palace of ths
Â«Emperor of Abyssinia is a large build -
Ing, built like a Swiss chalet, with a
red-tiled roof and whitewashed walls.
It is a very ordinary affair and is sur
rounded by huts and other Inferior
buildings. There is nothing splendid
about the palace or Its furnishings,
and. Indeed, It would be considered as
quite lacking In everything except size
as a residence for an American of
moderate means. But it is the palace
of an Emperor, nevertheless, and of a
powerful one.â Chicago Chronicle.
No monarch in the world excels the
Czar .Â»f liussiu in the splendor of. his
palaces. Â» Tsarskoye, near St. Peters
burg, where the Emperor has been
staying recently, has a park around it
which Is eighteen miles In circumfer
ence. One room of the palace has walls
of lapis lazuli and a floor of ebony in
laid with mother-of-pearl. Another has
walls of amber curiously carved and
the walls of,a third are laid thick with
gold. In the throne room of the pal
ace of the Shah of Persia there is a
carpet so thickly sown with pearls that
the texture of the cloth can hardly be
seen. Near iKls the throne of carved
wood, studded with Jewels valued at
55,000,000. Near the throne stands a
huge -silver vase set with pearls and
turquoises, but. strange to say, along
side of it stands a cheap European
painted urn, such as can be bought
anywhere for a dollar.
The Shah has curious ideas about the
value of things and on the walls of
one room a painting by one of the old
masters hangs side by side with a
gaudy poster advertising a dealer in
fish honks. In one room, where are
kept many curious articles of gold and
silver, heavy with gems, there Is said

PORT ARTHUR-T. Q., City. Just'
previous to the breaking out of the
Russo-Japanese war the population of
Port Arthur, Manchuria, was 10.000.
There la no means of knowing what it
is at thi3 time, as those in authority
have something else to look after than
a census of the population.
The University of Chicago has recently been enriched by the accession
of a splendid library devoted exclusively, to the history and philosophical dis
cussion of matrimony. - While the subject is of unquestioned fascination, the
youthful minds that approach it should do so with the warning that the
shadows of suggestion it throws are for the study of the past, not for the
guidance of the future. Matrimony never has been and probably never will
be one of the exact sciences.

General StoeÂ«?sel. who is defending Port Arthur with the splendid cour

s-aid to have given expression to wonderful profanity when he was informed
of the Japanese offer to him to surrender th^c fortress which has been so
valiantly defended. Perhaps the brave soldier was simply calling his lieu
tenants by name and some careless hesrer thought he was exercising the uni
versal privilege of man when in trouble.

be taken from him by the Presidio au
thorities. This frightened Paddy, so
he promptly hid the blanket. A wag
gish patron of the old cobbler dropped
in for a short chat not long since.
"Paddy," he said, "I hear you have
the blanket you used In the Civil .War.
I'd like to see it."
"Psch," hissed the old cobbler.
"They say the officers at the Presidio
will take It from me, because It has
letters on it. I'd not lose it for the
world."
Upon being assured that the visitor
would not tell of the existence of the
blanket Paddy consented to show it.
and he walked into the little room
in back of the shop. While he was
absent a sergeant walked in. Hur
riedly 'the visitor told him to tell
Paddy he came for the blanket.
When Paddy "reappeared* with . the
worn gray blanket the sergeant
promptly stepped forward and claimed
it as Government property. The old
man almost fell to the floor, but he
grabbed at the blanket ' and refused
to let go.
"Government, is It," he cried. "Sure
I've had it for forty years and more,

firmer hold on the blanket. "Me

In a. Spanish town recently a woman, much married but still hopeful,
led to the altar her eighth husband. The other seven had submitted to the
exceptional fortune of sudden death, and now the insurance companies, more
conservative than lovely woman, refuse to insure the life of spouse No. 8.
The fear of the companies should deepen the affection of the couple, stand
as another illustration of the power of the fair sex over suspicious man, and
insure to this eighth interest in matrimonial uncertainty a long continuance.
Bpeclal Correspondenc*.
HEADQUARTERS OF THE CAUL.,
5 HENRIETTA STREET, COVENT
GARDEN, LONDON, Aug. 13.â It is
doubted here if any woman masquer
ading as a man ever had a more ex
traordinary career than Catherine
Coome. She It Is whose arrest the
other day brought out the fact that
for the last fifty years she has worn
man's clothing, done man's work and
everywhere passed as a man. She is
devoted to her pipe, too. In which she
smokes the strongest kind of tobacco.
Strangest of all, however, Catherine
Coome has been twice married aa a
member of the sterner sex. Three
times in all has she entered the bonds
of wedlock, but on the first occasion,
as a maid "of fifteen, she wedded a
man. That marriage turned out un
happily and she resolved never to re
peat the experiment. ' The second
time in the role of & man she married
a woman and was rewarded with four
years of. domestic bliss. The third
time she .again married a woman and
for twenty-two years this strange but
happy matrimonial partnership was
maintained until the death of her
"wife" made her once moreâ should
one say a "widow" .or- "widower?"
Only once before her recent arrest,
she declares, was her sex detected.
She has been a 'captain's clerk and in
that capacity and subsequently as a
painter and decorator on the P. &-O.
Company's steamers has sailed over
many seas and seen much Â¦ of the
world. On shore she maintained her
self and the partners of her Joys and
sorrows for many years as a. house
painter. And finally as a fitting cli
max to her career she has elicited
from a magistrate the statement that
there Is no law In England - under
which a woman can be restricted from
donning masculine attire. '
She comes of a good family. Her
father was a man of some means and
a well known member of the Somerset
and Devon Hunt. She was educated
at a "young ladies' seminary" in Chel
tenham and before she was 16 she
married her first cousin, Perclval
Coome. He was 22 years older jthan
herself and according to her descrip
tion of him a thorough-going scamp.
He cruelly 111 used her, kept her un
der lock and key and- even cut off her
hair and sold it. She vowed after that
she would never, let It grow long
again, nor did she. Several , times she
ran away from him. but h* ajwavs
caught her and made her suffer for it.
It was after one of these experi
ences that she hit upon the Idea of
disguising herself in male attire that
she might the better hide from him.
She was 18 then and the change of
costume made her look like 'a bright
and handsome lad. It was before the
days of pursers and she readily ob
tained a position as captain's clerk, a
billet which insured her safety from
her husband's pursuit. For three and
a half years she held this position on
the same ship and no one suspected
her secret. The only embarrassment
she suffered, she says, waa from the
attention of feminine passengers, who
persisted in falling in love with her.-
One of them, an actress, and a famous
one in her time, actually, she declares,
besought her on bended knee to be
come her husband. "My legs were
then scarcely used to trousers," she
says, "and I waa so worried and
ashamed that I told her I was only a
girl. Her love then changed to friend
ship and my stanch friend she re
mained until she died."
On her last voyage on the shiD. ac
cording to her story, a girl fell so des
perately in love with her^that' when
port was reached she refused to go
home. By this time Catherine had
grown accustomed to her man role and
such a trifling matter as the love of
a maid no longer upset her. She got rid
of the girl by sending a telegram to her
father, a country rector, asking him to
take his too susceptible daughter home.
A Great Edition.
"Inaugural Edition St. Louis Star,
Dedicated, to Greater St. Louis, the
Gateway to Transcontinental Com
merce"âthis is the title of a publica
tion which has Just reached us.
It is in the form of. a large folio,
with illuminated backs and contains
128 pages of Illustrations and printed
matter, divided into seventeen sections,
treating of the various features of the
Exposition City, shown with a mar
velous wealth of illustration and de
scribed in a most attractive manner.
The heavy calendered white paper on
which the edition is printed has given
the artists and the printers good op
portunity to display their, abilities and
they have made the most of it. The
whole thins is indeed a marvel in con
ception and execution.
It was got out on March 13 of
this year in honor of the State's tak
ing pdssesslon of its splendid new
building at Twelfth and Olive streets.

EXCEPT in the Hearst papers, the campaign cartoons of the year are
amusingly humorous. They lack malice and serve the proper purpose
of such art. The cartoons of President Roosevelt, while aimed to em
phasize the view of him taken by his political opponents, are not belittling
nor malicious, and probably no one is more amused by them than himself.
After all, they, in a sort, represent him as he is, an independent, self-cen
tered American gentleman, strong of will for what he believes to be right,
and with high ideals which he is not ashamed to illustrate in his own life.
He is cartooned as full of boyish exuberance and enthusiasm and mature
strength and purpose. So Judge Parker is so cartooned as to present the
exact situation in which his candidacy places him. He is not caricatured in
features at all, but, like Hancock, appears as an amiable figure, meritorious
in his place, but oddly out of place in his new position as a Presidential candi
date. He says inopportune things and is a bit logy. Now that is exactly as
the public takes him, but without any disparagement of his character as a
citizerf. ':.i\Â§;
One noteworthy result of change of motive appears in the cartoons by
Davenport. Of course a cartoonist works in employment, and his pencil
executes the will of his employer. While Davenport was with Hearst his art
was subservient to the malice of his employer, and Davenport, one of the
most amiable and bright hearted of men, had to turn his art to the service
of graphic lampooning and libel. Finally, revolting at such degradation of
his genius, he quit an uncongenial service and his emancipated pencil is now
employed in the service of genuine good humor. Nothing more amusing
nor more telling has ever appeared than his cartoon representing the effect
of Judge Parker's one, term proclamation in his speech of acceptance. It
does not touch nor tarnish the dignity of Judge Parker's personality, but in
the subsidiary figures represents, truthfully, the amused expression of the
whole country. It effervesces humoc in every line and is void of malice.
The spirit of the campaign cartoons is inspired by the feeling of the peo
ple. In the South, where superfervid expression and torrid oratory are stiil
preferred to the noble rhetoric of understatement, there are not a few ex
amples of old-time rampanting in denunciation of President Roosevelt. But
hi .the States that hare a decisive voice in the result his election is accepted
. as certain, and his supporters treat his opponent with respect, that is in a
large measure reciprocated.
POLITICAL CARTOONS.
IT takes a long time to provide machinery by which public authority may
guard the purity of a food supply. Congress began it three or four years
ago by appointing a joint committee to investigate the condition of our
domestic food supply. This was the outcome of the "embalmed beef" ex
citement that followed the Spanish war. The report of that committee cov
ered n:cat products, canned goods, beer and other liquors and grain prepa
ration?, j
It was quite thorough and furnished evidence-that our people are not yet
experts in the sophistication of food. While considerable adulterations were
i'ouad, they were not of the most noxious kind. When one edible product,
s>ach as lard or cotton seed oil or chicory, is used to sophisticate another edi
ble product, the cheat is in getting for the" cheaper adulterant the price of
the pure article. It is a cheat, but it is not a poisonous cheat. It is commer
cial dishonor to compound such a cheat, but it is not murder. It is the duty
c.f the Government, however, to protect the people against a cheat, as well
as against poison.
.After this examination of our domestic products, .steps were taken to test
imported foods. When that inquiry had progressed in the hands of the
Agricultural Department, it was Â§oon apparent that in many of our imported
foods we were not only cheated, but were being poisoned as well. Imported
oiivc oil was found to be stretched with lard, cotton seed, mustard and pea
nut oil. Now all imported olive oil is subjected to examination and i|f
character is determined before it is allowed to go into commerce. The pure
olive oil of California is undersold by the foreign product, but since the for
eign oil has been subjected to examination the reason is developed. The
foreign oil is largely stretched by cheap adulterants. Those who wish to use
pure oil have only one way to get it. They must find it in any of the many
olive oils of California.
The imported wines are found to be almost universally impure, and many
of them are loaded with harmful adulterants, which must seriously impair
the health of habitual users. Dr. Wylie, the chemist of the Agricultural De
partment, says that there is probably not a barrel of pure Scotch whisky
in the United States. It is a creosoted compound. This will be unpleasant
I'tws for those who indulge in hot Scotch in the winter and Scotch high
balls in the summer. Such drinkers could take some corn high wines and
creosote and make th<?ir own Scotch, that would be as satisfactory and as
harmful as the imported article. Imported sausage is found to be an unspeak
able article, and exceedingly dangerous to health. Imported fruits in glass
are dyed with everything from copperas to aniline, and are loaded with
that are active poison.
The revelations of the investigation are such that the Government pro
poses to establish laboratories at New York, Boston, Philadelphia, New
Orleans. San Francisco and Chicago- to examine sample lots of all importa
tions of food and beverages, and those that are impure will be denied ad
mission to the country. At present the expert examinations at this port are
made at the State University. But a conveniently located Federal laboratory
ran greatly extend that work by making it a specialty. When these labora
tories are established, their use may well be extended. They can examine
exports as well as imports, and if conducted with the strict integrity which
should characterize such work their certificate to the purity of an export
will come to be taken by the public authorities of Europe as sufficient testi
mony to its character.
These laboratories maj r also be used to establish the character of foods and
Leverages intended for domestic consumption, and their work in that line will
be an important check upon domestic adulteration. Avarice is the motive in
all adulterations, noxious and innocuous, and avarice is the most sinister
and ingenious of all the human passions. It can only be met by equal in
penuity, but above all, by the strictest official integrity. We may expect it
to be met in that way by the scientific representatives of the Government.
Scientific men are noted for lack of avarice themselves, so that they arc the
most incorruptible class in the public service.

upon which both sides split was the
"open" or^ ''closedâshop policy.
The employers insisted on the "open
shop," while the union men were de

unless the "closed" shop system pre
vailed.-- In other. words, the employes
wanted the proprietors to discharge
all their non-union help employed

but union men in future. .

After a delay of many months the
impaneling of a jury to try the case
of Alexander B. Garnett, charged with
the murder of Major J. W. McClung In
the rooms of Mrs. Elizabeth Hitchcock-
Coit in the Palace Hotel on November
25 last, was commenced in Judge Law
lor's court yesterday afternoon. Dis
trict Attorney Bylngton and Assistant
Attorney Ferral are conducting the
prosecution and Attorney George D.
'Collins represents the defendant.
The morning session was occupied in
an argument of counsel on a challenge
to the panel interposed by Attorney
Collins. He objected to the jurors sum
moned on "a special venire by the Sher
iff by order of the court, claiming that
the Jury should be selected from the
regular panel. The Judge allowed the
challenge and fifty-three names out of
the 150 composing the special venire
which were in the box were ordered
taken out and the jurors dismissed.
There were fifty-six names of the reg
ular panel in the box and the impanel
ing of the jury to try the case was pro
ceeded with from these names. The
jury was nearly completed when court
adjourned till 1:30 o'clock this after
noon. It was evident from the ques
tions put to the jurors by Attorney
Collins that the plea of the defense
will be that the shooting was acci
dental; that the revolver was dis
charged during a struggle between Ma
jor McClung and the defendant for its
possession.
The tonly eyewitness to the shooting
was Mrs. Colt and she Is supposed to
be in Paris, France. A list of inter
rogatories, to be put to her was sent to
the American Consul at Paris, but he
wrote that nothing could be done with
out the usual fees being forwarded.
The fees were not sent and the depo
sition was not taken. She testified at
the preliminary hearing before Police
Judge Fritz and her testimony will
be read to the jury. It .is claimed for
the defense that there are Important
points favorable to the defendant that
are not contained in the transcript
made by the court stenographer.
The following jurors were selected
in the Garnett case, the list being
completed at 6 o'clock last night:
Mark I. Cole, 614 Fell street; Gardner
A. B. Spencer, 216 Devisadero street:
Aaron Wiener, 1526 , Geary Btreet;
Frederick Leffler, 1703 Page street;
David Brown, 862 Shrader street:
Arthur P. Sinclair, 244 Devisadero

W. E. Brown of the Argyle Hotel at
ISA McAllister street applied for a war
rant at the bond and warrant clerk's
office yesterday for the arrest of B. S.
Falon-Briggs on a charge of passing a
'fictitious check. The warrant was i*ot
issued for lack of sufficient evidence,
but Erown promised to bring v.ith him
this morning A. J. Court, to whom the
check wsfc alleged to be made payable,
Â¦which will be all that is required.
Five or bIx months ago Briggs was
Â«nip!oyed at the hotel ind was dis
charged. He returned about six weeks
ago representing that he "."as the Pa
cifl* Coast superintendent of the Amer
ican Dttectlve Association ot Indianap
olis. He engaged a room and made
himself officious bv reporting from
Urri* to time to Brown that he vras be
ing xt'bbe -3 by his employ<*s.
.Last Sunday he asked Brown to cash
a check for $76 on the Donohoe-Kelly
Banking Company. It was made pay
able to A. J. Court and he explained
that it was for services rendered by
himself and Court in an important
case. Brown gave him the money and
that night he left the hotel and was
not since returned. The check was re
turned by the bank as worthless. It
had been indorsed by Briggs.
Dr. W. Dwight, who lives in the ho
tel, told Brown that he met Briggs
on Market street on Wednesday night.
He called Briggs by name but Briggs
declined to respond and walked away
quickly. Briggs was wearing an over
coat belonging to the elevator bov at
the hotel.

Of Sufficient Evidence
VICTDI IS AFTER HIM
CHIEF WITNESS ABSENT
Thomas Murphy, arrested for slum-
William Green, professional mendi
cant, resisted arrest by Patrolman
Cook and also Informed that officer
that the Police Court had no terrors for
him. His demeanor before Judge Con
lan did not belie that assertion, for he
glared defiantly at the bench and an
nounced his readiness to accept "the
limit" He got Itâ six months In the
County Jailâ and "with jaunty air re
entered the cage.
Mrs. Annie Dinalake testified that Ah
Chung entered her "variety store" at
1909 McAllister street and after vainly
trying to persuade her to purchase
some Chinese bric-a-brac insulted her.
"She talkee lonsense," eald Ah Chung
'to Judge Cabaniss. "Me no makee lin-
Bult. Me good pioleer. Camee to elitty
in sllxty-seben. Me slixty yeahs < ole.
No lnsultee lady."
The pig-tailed pioneer was sent to
prison for twenty-four hours.
W. J. Greenfield was* arrested at 2
o'clock yesetrdav morning as he was
departing from the Winchester Hotel
and W. Cartledge and" A. E. Rennlng
are ready to testify that he entered
their room and stole the watch and
chain which was found in his posses
sion when they caught him in the cor
ridor and turned him over to the cus
tody of Patrolman Mackay. Judge
Conlan will hear their testimony next
Monday.
Mrs. Julia. Duftv, after a week of
fairly pacific conduct, renewed dis
turbing the peace of her daughter-in
law, Mrs. Annie Duffy, in their com
mon home on Guy place, and the
younger woman then repeated her for
mal complaint and had the elder re
arrested. Judge Cabaniss continued
the original case for thirty days in or
der to give the defendant opoprtunity
to show bv amended behavior that she
was entitled -to dismissal, and when she
stood before him yesterday he roundly
chided her for being there so soon.
"J. will now confess." said his Honor,
"that your previous release was largely
due to your declaration of political
principles and my desire to deal gently
with an erring co-partisan. You said
you were a 'Horse and Cart,' and I,
as a McNab loyalist, tempered justice
with mercy. That plea, madam, can
not help you in this case."
"Since my previous appearance here,"
said Mrs. Duffy, "I have Joined the
McNabbites, and that, too, despite the
fact that the 'Horses and Carts,' mar
shaled by Johnnie Greeley, carried the
primaries of my district. But politics
shall not enter my present plea either
directly or by Implication. I want time
to bring in witnesses to testify to my
reputation for sobriety and good be
havior at all times and under all cir
cumstances. Will you be so good as to
instruct your clerk to teeue subpenas
for Mrs. Hlggins, Mrs. Robinson and
Mrs. Terrier, all of whom have known
me for years and will testify that I
have always been a lady?"
"That I will," responded the court,
"and next Monday we will hear what
the three ladles have to say about
you." ."Â¦-\'*- i ;
A Salvation Army agent pleaded hard
for , the release of Pearl Barker, a
pretty girl who was arrested for
drunkenness a few hours after Judge
Ccmlan had dismissed a similar charge
against her in response to her promise
that she would immediately leave town.
She then stated that she had recently
come from Redding to seek employ
ment as a house servant and had fallen
among evil companions in the Sixth
street lodging-house where she lived.
"I have talked with this young
woman," said the Salvationist, "and
believe she is thoroughly repentant and
eager to return to good living. Her
parents are respectable people at Red
ding and if you let her go I will see to
it that she returns to them as soon as
possible."
"I had made up my mind to send her
to Jail for six months," said the Judge
after a moment's "tfiought, "but "she
will be given another chance. If ahe
is brought before me again no appeal
can save her from receiving the limit."
The girl wep.t copiously as she ac
companied her Samaritan from the
courtroom.
In rebuttal of his mother-in-law's
testimony Mr. O'Shea started to Im
pugn the complainant's character
fore he married her, but the Judge
sharply shut off his fervid arraignment
and continued the -case tUl Septem
ber 15.
Mike O'Shea, described by thÂ» ar
resting policeman as "one of the .ped
dling O'Sheas," flatly denied his wife's
accusation that he neglected to pro
vide for her proper maintenance and
supplemented the denial with a declar
ation that her viciousness of temper
was primarily responsible for all the
trouble that seethed in their common
domicile on Eighth street. He would
like to state, in order to convey to
Police Judge Cabanlss an adequate
idea of Mrs. O'Shea's vitriolic disposi
tion, that he was unable to find de
cent lodging for his horse because she
had orally abused every stablekeeper
with whom he had placed the animal
and he could not persuade any other
liveryman to accommodate him. As
a consequence the horse, after hauling
a truck wagon all day, Is compelled to
spend his nights outdoors and the noc
turnal fogs do not contribute to the
upbuilding of a physical constitution
impaired by age, toll and irregular
feeding. If the animal dies, its death
must be laid at the door of Mrs.
O'Shea.
Mrs. Mary Core, mother-in-law of
the defendant, emphatically defended
her daughter's character from Mr.
O'Shea's aspersions. A better-natured
woman than Mrs. O'Shea never tried to
live In harmony with a human brute,
Mrs. Core averred, and as for doing or
saying anything that might bring dis
comfort upon the horse, Mrs. O'Shea
was absolutely incapable of such con
duct. Love of dumb animals was one
of Mrs. O'Shea's dominant character
istics and perhaps if Mr. O'Shea were
dumb she might forgive his failure to
provide her with life's necessaries. But,
alas! he did not possess even that ap
peal to the sympathy of a woman who
was a hundred ptr cent too good to be
dependent upon the like of him.
Attorney Cannon, for "the defense,
gave notice that he will object to the
taking of Father Gray's testimony on
the ground that he is mentally incom
petent. ' . . â¢
Contrary to expectation, the Rev.
Father Gray did not appear in Judge
Conlan's court yesterday to testify as
to his dealings with Dr. Thomas F.
Brennan, accused of robbing him of
$37,000 while acting as his medical ad
viser. The aged clergyman Is an in
mate of St. Joseph's Hospital, and his
attorney offered to have him in court
at 2 o'clock p. m., but another case
had precedence on the calendar and
a '"'"â¢ntinuance was ordered till Mon
day. Â¦
John Ellwood, accused of burglary,
was held to answer in the Superior
Court, with bail fixed at $2000, by Judge
Conlan. He was arrested for robbing
a room in a Turk-street lodging-house
where he was employed as bellboy.
HermanJSchouling made some furni
ture â¢ fbf?*Slrs. O. Blason and then
broke '-it,^ for*' which he was arrested
a'nd charged with disturbing the peace.
Incidentally he . smashed a window in
Mrs.. Blasdn's domicile by hurling a
flower- p^t through it.
"I had a. right to break the furni
ture," he .pleaded before Judge Ca
baniss, "and I'll restore the broken
window."
"If you have ever .read the adven
tures of Humpty-Dumpty," said the As
sistant District Attorney, "you will
probably remember the couplet:
All the King's horsea and all the King's men
Couldn't put Humpty-Dumpty together again.
"So it is with. Mrs. Blason's broken
window. You can't restore it, but you
can ptft in a new pane. Let us be
as literal as possible in these things."
Mrs. Sciiouling, the defendant's wife,
testified in his behalf, but he was
given the alternative of paying a fine
of $30 or serving thirty days in prison
and chose the latter.
bering upon the sward of Union
Square, also manifested a desire to be
incarcerated, but his mien was differ
ent from that of Mr. Green.
"I was sleeping there because I had
no money with which to hire a room,"
he meekly said, "and I am not feeling
well enough to earn money. I think
about ten days in Jail would restore
my strength sufficiently to enable me
to hold a Job if I get. one.", m
"Ten days it is," said the Judge, "and
I hope it will do what you desire."

Munroe's sameness is of the bulldog
order. In the first round of his fight
with Sharkey the Â«ailor sent him reel
ing across the ring -with a blow that
would have felled an ox: "Munroe came
back full of fight and Boon had all the
earn taken out of Sharkey.
The betting is an indication of . the
popular opinion regarding the outcome
of the fight. Wagering opened with
Jeffries a 3Â»* to 10 choice. All the tickets
written have. been, at these, figures. .The
Jeffries money comes in thousands from
Jeffries' friends have an idea that
Munroe is deficient in hitting power,
but this feeling is not shared by the
miner's boxing partners. He c knocked
them down repeatedly with jolty; half
arm blows, which seemed to the spec
tators to have no power behind them.
He was unusually considerate of his
sparring partners nnd seldom used all
his Strength.
MCXROE IS GAME.
For an opponent he will have Jack
Munroe, the heaviest man he has ever
faced and the most rugged. In the
past there has been a wide'discrep
ancy between the weiffht of the cham
pion and that of his opponent. This
XC3X especially noticeable in the bouts
with Fitzsimmons and Corbett, the
former weighing about 170 pounds,
and the latter ISO.
In the fights with these men Jeffries
agreed to a clean break, which slowed
down the action to a considerable de
gree, as at th^ order of the referee the
men had to break and stop back with
out any attempt at hitting. The ac
tion to-niKht should be swift as the
men can hit while they have an arm
free and must protert themselves com
5ng out of a clinch.
This was proposed by the Munroe
people, and as Kid McCoy suggested it
he has undoubtedly been shown some
thing by Munroe which warrants him
meeting Jeffries at his own game. The
latter's short-arm blows have terrible
power behind them. but. apparently,
Munroe counts upon blocking them
successfully and giving some in re
turn.
Champion James J. Jeffries will de
fend his title of the world's greatest
boxer in Mechanics' Pavilion to-night
for the ninth time since he gained
the laurels by knocking out Bob
Fitzsimmons in elÂ»v^n rounds at Co
ney Island in June, 1899.
fellows like Jeffries will Munroe."
When Mr. Potter of Texas had to slay
a few of his friends In the company it
was always "as Jeffries would do it."
So it went through the play until the
end. Every sally that railed attention
to Jeffries was greeted with rounds of
applause until Jeffries was forced to
leave his box. The audience was en
tirely on the Jeffries end and they ap
plauded the big- champion.

CHICAGO, Aug. 25. â The races at
Hawthorne to-morrow attracted the
following entry:
HAWTHORNE ENTREES.
Jeffries, despite his bulk, moves about
with the speed of a lightweight. He
is a 'tireless worker and goes at his
training like a man who enjoys every
moment of it.
The Yosemite Club officials expect
at least a $30,000 house. There. was a
rush for tickets yesterday, the sport
ing men having, apparently, made up
their minds that there was no . possi
bility of disappointment this time.
Munroe know? he Is fighting the
greatest man the ring has ever known.
He says other champions have been
dethroned, and he will try his hand at
king making. He is trained to the
hour. His condition is much better than
It was at the time the flgtit was post
poned. He has learned ring tactics
rapidly since then, and the question
\vhiehr"rpmains to be answered to-night
is whether Jeffries has gone back far
enough since his last ring engagement
to give Munroe a chance of winning.
Jeffries and his friends are sure he
has not gone back and his strength
and his activity seem to bear them
out.
HAS JEFFRIES GOXK RACIf.
Spider Kelly and other fight experts
believe Munroe will make a -desperate
stand against Jeffries, although on
form they do not figure him a winner.
The miner is fairly fighting for his life
and is expected to prove a dangerous
factor until one or the other of the
combatants js declared the winner. In
the Bu'tte fight' Munroe never backed
up an. inch, although he was. severely
punished for a time. He is not worry-
Ing dvÂ»r to-nighfs engagement. It
seems farthest from his thoughts and
he discusses It but little. His" rest has
freshened him up noticeable during the
past two days.
the heavy bettors, while the Munroe
end is nibbled at by the men who havÂ»
cashed on so many long shots. The
betting on. the rounds is still even
money that Jeffries will win in tep
rounds.
In the tenth. while Corbett and
Gorton were dreaming of other days.
Lynch made good on his slide for life
just as the chronic fans were telephon
ing for blankets. Ted Sullivan, a rep
resentative of the Cincinnattl Reds,
watched Keefe's work and hummed,
"I've Got My Eyes on You."
. An inebriated automobllist arrived
\ at the grounds in the tenth. "What's
er news?" he asked.
"Port â¢ Arthur has fallen," replied
the, gatekeeper.
"Who wants know about Port Ar
thur?" asked the wobbly gent. "How
about Joe Corbett?"
"Joe Corbett's fallen, too," said the
gatekeeper.
"Good night," said the automobilist.
"Hey, Bill," he shouted to the chauf
feur. "Aim her at Twin Peaks and
let her go. We don't care what hap
pens now." Here is how it occurred:

Had Lynch failed to" land the anvil
men in theWurzburger garden would
be still in' the grounds telling how it
should harve been done. But he made
it. Corbett lined to Gorton, who
tagged the batter by mistake. Lynch,
who started with the ball, ploughed
through the dust with the winning
run. : ' j/i r -'i
Of course there was a heated dis
cussion. James Whalen, the boy ora
tor, was the eloquent kid for the Seals,
while Charlie Graham was chief at
torney for the Tigers. After 10 min
utes of conversation that would be
barred at pink teas. Umpire O'Connell
sent the self-appointed delegates to
the woods and O. K'ed the run.
The bout between Corbett and
Keefe was as close as the one between
Kuroki and Kuropatkin, who are play
ing a different game in the Far East.
It was the boy who has a name to
make against the one who has made
a name and wants to keep it. Â¦-Â¦â¢'{'Â¦'Â¦;'
There were just two hits off each
for ninÂ« innings. Then Gochnauer
ran amuck. Lynch landed one into
his territory and the imported short
stop thought Van Buren was a skyr
scraper. The throw went into a po
litical discussion in the bleachers and
Lynch went for two. - Casey sacrificed
him to third.

curred during the running of the Sara
nac handicap of $5000 at one mjle and
a furlong. There were only three con
tenders, Fort Hunter, Dolly Spanker
and St. Valentine. Fort Hunter opened
a strong favorite in the betting at 4 to
5, but'a heavy play on Dolly Spanker
sent the price to even money. St. Val
tine was so utterly neglected that his
price soared from 4 to 8 to 1. Dolly
Spanker rushed out in the lead, followed
by Fort Hunter, while St. Valentine
trailed along in the rear. There was no
change in position until the three-quar
ter-mile post was reached, where- Fort
Hunter was seen to falter and fall
back rapidly. Travers began a vigor
ous ride on St. Valentine, which was
five lengths behind and succeeded in
reaching Dolly Spanker as they
passed the grand stand. Shaw "out
flnished" Travers and Dolly Spanker
won by a nose, with Fort Hunter limp
ing along ten lengths in the rear. Sum

Tokalon was always the favorite for
the stake race, though 8 to 5 was ob

all the pace and looked like a winner
at the head of the stretch. White

point and In a hard drive beat her.
"Pa" Bradley's fllley Ahola, which
beat Big Ben and Clifton Forge at a

Bounti. which arrived the other day from
Antwerp, was only 127 da>-3 maklmc the long

Bcund. however, is a sallorrnan of the school
that ence made the Yankee clipper ramous.
Prom th<* time he leaves port until he reaches
his destination he ne\er misses a chance to
ke*p his ship moving. It never blows too
hard for him and he has the reputation of

his daring he has had few accidents and al
though quite a youngster has a splendid record
of smart passage*. His owners and the un

A special arrangement has been de
vised for the Victorian's machinery
whereby reversing power equal to that
of her forward propelling power can
be imparted to it, securing the almost
instantaneous arrest of the steamer's
forward motion and speedy backing in
case it is needed. Her propellers are
three in number, each on a separate
length of shafting.
The Victorian will be fitted with a
wireless telegraph apparatus and will
carry a complete printing outfit be
tween decks. Her tonnage is about
12.000 and she i3 expected to develop
about 10,000 horsepower.
The Victorian is to be fitted in a
most luxurious manner and is to carry
1500 passengers, but the chief interest
in her lies in her propelling power.
Turbine steamers on the Clyde and In
cross-channel sen-ice have proved very
successful, mainly because they have
afforded more comfort to passengers,
but considerable- modifications . had to
be devised to meet the requirements of
the Atlantic service, including enor
mous propelling power and great stop
ping, backing and steering power.
These difficulties are understood to
have been overcome by Charles A. Par
sons, the engineer, who has developed
the steam turbine and made it suit
able for the generation of electri^lty
and the propulsion of mercantile and
war vessels.
BELJFAST. Ireland, Aug. 25.â The Al
lan Line steamer Victorian, the largest
turbine vessel yet built, was launched
here to-day.. It is expected that she
will be ready for service before the end
of the year. She is 540 feet long, has
a sixty-foot beam and her depth is
forty; feet six inches.
N'ETT. YORK. Aug. 25.â Charged with
having writen worthless checks, a man
xrto registered two weeks ago at a
Brighten Beach summer hotel as
"Count A- Gerhard M. Zu Progen,
Lieutenant U. S. A.." has been locked
up In the Sheepshead Bay police sta
tion. Later it was developed that the
man was a private in the Eighth In
fantry, who enlisted a year ago and
tfntil he went on leave two weeks ago
had been acting as clerk in the Quar
termaster's Department of Governors
Island. His friends at the army post
believe their comrade Is connected with
a noble German family, as he claimed
to be.
The prisoner's appearance at the ho
tel created quite a little interest and
fte rapidly, made acquaintaaces, giving
dinner occasionally to some of the fe
male guests. Finally he asked the man
fijrer to cash a check for $50 and was
accommodated. This was followed by
another for SSS. Both were drawn by
jhe Quartermaster at Governors Island
and indorsed by the "Count." but as
They came back from the bank the
manager had his guest arrested.
A few minutes after the police had
acted a corporal and squad arrived
from the post. They demanded posses
sion of the prisoner. The corporal said
the papers cashed by the hotel people
, were pay checks, genuine enough, but
v. orthless with the indorsement shown.
The" police, refused, however, to give
the â¢"Ccunf up until he had been ex
amined by the civil authorities. "When
marched by the police a new wedding
ring was found in the "Count's" pocket.

The United States inspectors of hulls
and boilers at this port have a repu
tation for the conscientious perform
ance of their frequently unpleasant
duty which has made this port & ter
ror to the owner or operator of any
thing in the coffin-ship line. Ship
owners great and small are compelled
to observe all the laws by means of
which the Government has tried to
offset the perils of travel by water.
A Slocum disaster here would be im
possible, for the reason that wherever
passengers are carried the local in
spectors see that all emergency gear
Is In proper working order.
An example has just been furnished
on the new liner Manchuria of the
thoroughness with which the local in-
Fpectcrs do their work and the fear
lessness with which they enforce the
law.
The Manchuria was Inspected In New
York and pronounced, with all her
gr-ar, up to Uncle Sam's ex
acting standard. The local in
spectors found that S00 new life
preservers on the big liner, with the
O. K. stamp of the New York inspec
tors still fresh on their white canvas
covers, lacked the buoyancy required
by the law and every one of the SOO was
condemned. These life preservers are
filled with a fiber called "kapoc" and
they lack about four pounds the weight
considered necessary to entitle them to
the name of "preservers."
The Pacific Mail Company has
thrown aside these S00. â¢ unused, un
worn articles and has substituted S00
serviceable life belts.

CHICAGO, Aug. 25. â At the start there were
bulls in the wheat trade who seemingly
maneuvered for a further break, and under
thÂ«lr manipulation prices dipped below those
of the previous close. September started with
a loss of llic to 1',-jc, at $1 03% to 51 ffiu
and December -at %c to lie. at $1 04>4<tf
1 04*8. The weakness was only temporary,
and ..buyinr at the lower prices soon rallied
the market and rent, it on an advance that
carried September . to $1 00?i and December
to $1 0734. Temperatures in the Northwest
were regarded as close enough to the danger
line to make it advisable not to sell. This
applied both to those who had actual wh*at
to sell and thsse who otherwise might have
been temDted to rell It short on the extreme
weakness of the foreign markets. Commission
houses had numerous buyinc orders, and their
efforts, to execute them, together with covering
by many 'â¢ local traders who sold short yester
day on the break ln prices, supplied buoyancy
to the market. Many big .longs. who recently
disposed of their holdings were also In a buying
mood to get back their lines. . There was a re
newal of the rust and short crop reports from
Manitoba, and these reports added zest to the
bullish tone of the market. Toward the end
of the session the market weakened on heavy
profit taking. Late weather reports indicated
rising temperatures for Friday in the frost
menaced districts. The break in corn prices
had some effect on wheat. All operated to
reduce the advance to modest dimensions.
September closed at $1 04 and Docember at
$1 C5yiÂ©rO5?K. The final tone was eaay.
Corn* was easy at the start, under 'the in
fluence of favorable weather conditions, lower
cables and a crop estimated at 2,500,000,000
bushels, ; barring an early frost. September
started unchanged to -^c higher, at.63Â»Â«c to

largely overstocked up to a day or so ago, ,
only two or three reported themselves over- ;
supplied yesterday. They naturally c^n- j
tlr.ued weak, but the rest were steadier. The

I their regular Los Angeles market again, as i
i they can now do better there than here, anil '
this is relieving the situation materially. Deal

were taking their contract supplied of Cling

operating In the open market, as available sup

NEW TORK. Aug. 26. â Mora favorable ad
vices as to crop â¢ prospects, particularly for
corn and ccttcn. imparted a very flrm tone to
to-day'j etock market, though the trading was
aguin in moderate volume and of a professional
character. It was evident, too that much of
the recent talk cf damask to' wheat in tho
Northwest Â»u exagTerated and circulated
largely for speculative effect. Nevertheless, on
fresh reports of frosts in Monitoba, wheat ad
vanced sharply in the early afternoon. The
Gould stocks were again active at material ad
vances. For th* first time in some days Union
Pacific and Scuthf-rn Pacific were comparative
ly active. Some demand for Union Pacillc in
the latis session sent that ftock up to its re
cent high level, but rljewhe're the liet showed
a tendency to eag. Alter seme hesitation the
market once more became EtronK. in spite of
further rrofit-takln/?. and the closing, though |
below the best cf the day, showed few marked
r*-ce?Â«inns. Union Pacific lost t-cme of its late
advance en heavy telling. Amalgamated Cop
ier was the most noteworthy feature cf the
industrial Rrrup. and the ii-sue of that com
pany was dull, with no decided tone. Thus far
the money market has made little response to
'the conditions arising from shipment of cur
rency to the interior. The rate of call loans
advanced a lraclion. Two additional shipments
ef crop money were announced. $500,000 to Chi
cago and $150,000 to New Orleans. Sterling
exchange became weaker late in tho day. on
the very little demand for remittances.
In United States Government bonds the old
4s advanced of 1 per cent and the new reg
istered 4s % of 1 per cent on call.
Railroad bonds were firm. Total sales, par
value, $2,05,000.

a mystery to the average mind. Now

equal where oysters exclusively are
served. It is to be hoped that there are
sufficient lovers of oysters here to make
such ! a place profitable. A few other

then be the survival of the fittest, with

House Movers Must Give Bond.
Superior Judge Troutt yesterday
modified his injunction order of July
27 restraining the San Francisco Gas
and Electric Company, the Police
Judges and the Chief of Police from
causing the arrest and prosecution of
D. J. Sullivan and other house movers
for cutting the company's wires in
the course of their business. .The
modified order requires that the house
movers shall give the company notice
in writing of intention to move
through the wires and the company
shall cut the wires. The house
movers must pay the actual cost of
labor and materials employed in each
cutting and shall give a form of bond
which has been agreed upon.- The
bend secures the payment for each
case of wire cutting, but provides that
if the litigation now' pending is de
cided in favor of the house movers
the company will have, to pay the
money back. If there is future
trouble over the payments it is agreed
that each payment may be a seperate
cause for': action or all may be Joined.

Cummings, the rew Park Commis

and is 28 years of age. He came to this
city at an early age and was reared In
the public schools. He also studied
art here and spent three years in the
art centers of France, being a pupil of
aiercler and a student in the Ecole des
Beaux Arts at Paris.
He returned to this city recently and
is at present a profea33r of modeling

figures having been exhibited in the
Paris Sa'on.
Mayor Schmitz yesterday formally
announced the appointment of Earl
Cummings, an artist by profession, to
be Park Commissioner in place of A.
Altmann, transferred to the Board of
Education. The appointment was made
in accordance with the charter pro
vision requiring one of the tiembers of
the Park Commission to be an artist.
Cuniminjrs took his oath of office be

In order to make a comparison the

reeking admission to this country as
native Americans. No sooner is one
trick exposed than another is devised.
The latest is knc^.Ti as the "Bones
Bock." In many carÂ»es applicants for
admission set forth ihat their parents
are dead and that at least one of them
died in this State. Some time ago
Commissioner Heacnck. knowing that
the bones of all deceased Chinamen
Ere shipped to China for final inter
ment, sent fer the records of one of
the companies and found that the
bonee of the applicant's father had
been shipped from this port, thus cor
roborating the appBcanfs story.
But the trick vu sprung last
Wednesday. "The "Bones Book" con
tained the record as stated by the ap
plicant, but the name'; of the decedent
had been scratched out and the name
cf the applicant's father had been in
serted in its stead. The paper being
soft, the scratcb#r had' almost made a
hc!e in it, and there was a difference
in the color of tbe inks. The applicant
Â¦will be deported.
The very nature of things is such that In
our whole social life, in'cmr intercourse with
one another and in the most trivial as well
as in Â¦ the most important thlnp?. â¢ we are re
quired to\take matters on trust. If this,
Uerefor*. is true. of the material, the Intel

natural order, does It not- seem astonishing
that we, should, become at once Independent

the supernatural- order where God dwells in

"Faith, Its Dangers and Safeguards,"
was the subject of a profound address
delivered by his Grace Archbishop
Montgomery last evening in St. Mary's
Cathedral for the benefit of- the Chil
dren's Day Homes. In expressing grat
ification in the name of the Sisters of
the Holy Family for so large ah, at-'
tendance his Grace said:
I arked Archbishop Rlordan this morning
how the Sisters live by just *uch assistance
us th'.Â« b*rÂ»Â»flt afMrds and hr replied that they
live like ilie snanows, they live like the
lilies of the field, they live like the birds of
the air that God feeds.
Yes. they have friends in you. for God works
through bla agents. hencÂ« they have no
anxiety. Faith inspires the work of the Bis
ters and faith Inspire* the church.
Some days ago many of .you no doubt were
.participants in the dedication of. the Little
S*i*tÂ»rs" Old People's Home. Tou saw there
r.hat was being achieved. The work of the
Sisters of the Holy Family and tnat of the
Little t-Msters is similar. Their work extends
from the Potrero to the North Beach and
iicng almost half of the city in the other
direction. ThÂ«Â»ir work arDeals to . the prac
tical, for they assist those, who are willing
to assist themselves. They, receive. Into their
homes the children of mothers who needs must
toil for a livelihood, and were it not for the
homes these very mothers would be com
pelled to remain Indoors to tend their young
and would b* unable to perform the duties of
breadwinners. Thus, the mothers of the Httle
ones are not pauperized, but are enabled to go
out to work through the practical assistance
given by the Sisters and yourselves.
Speaking to the subject of the ad
dress, his Grace said in part:
To man belong powers that belong to no
other earthly creature, aspirations given to
ncne ' besides. These powers, these impulses,
these aspirations transcend all material things
â the universe itself cannot compass them.
Though man is by nature finite, he Is by
adoption and by destiny participant of the in
finite. This completion of his being and this
participation of th* infinite are begun on earth
and wrought out through the truths of holy
faith, to be crowned in their fullness In
heaven. .
Faith, or truth known through faith. Is the
si-blimest knowledge possible. .
On<* great difficulty, and in fact perhaps the
greatest difficulty for the majority of men In
belie\lng. is that they are asked to accept
th* truths of faith on authority or on trust
In others. Let us consider, therefore, briefly
this objection rnd we *hall see that, so far
from this forming any valid reason for not
believing. It ought to appeal to intelligent and
unprejudiced minds as antecedently proper
that we should accept truths of faith on trust,
for the very- reason that we do *o in almost
even' other contingency and circumstance of
human life.

The home of the late Rudolph W.
Schultze, murdered by Gustav Scherf,
is a house of sorrows.
Along the'bay shore in the little cot

moans and wonders why it was. She
has not even the poor clay of the fallen
protector to hold in the desolation of
her home. That is at the Morgue

slab. The dead man's aged . mother
and . two little children are with the
mourning widow and they moan and
wonder why. ::~%f,~
Up on the crest of Bernal Heights,
where the drearv winds from over the
sea are always blowing., another wom
an moans â for but yesterday Scherf.
the fiend, was a babe in her arms.
The killing of Schultze has created
unusual excitement throughout the city
and everywhere people are character
izing the act as a wanton and sense
less murder. Schultze was Well known
by the business men of the city, espe
pecially on the water front, and his
standing among them was of the high
est. There is one hope in connection
with the crime and that is that. the
murderer may receive without delay his
Just deserts.
Around his old haunts in Butcher
town Scherf bears an unsavory reputa
tion. Cattle and sheep often have dis
appeared from their corrals in the
night and stockmen often have ac
cused Scherf. He is believed to have
been with "Walter Ayhens, who, with
his brother, slaughtered two yearlings
in the yard of James McDermott.
wholesale butcher, July 14, and is now
in the County Jail awaiting trial.
South San Franciscans say Scherf
was alwavs too handy with a pistol
and was never very far away from
one, and that he. tried hard to kill
George Cavanaugh a year ago, but his
aim was bad and his plea of being
drunk was good.
Scherf was the central figure of an
investigation into the mismanagement
and dishonesty of the city pound last
January, and though it was proved he
had taken part in a scheme to defraud
the city, he was not prosecuted. How
ever, he soon left the pound, but was
re-employed by Irwin, the keeper.
* BREAKS UP A HOME.
He has been living with Mrs. Kate
Parsons at 11 Holliday avenue. The
history of his connection with this
Woman is another leaf in the story of
Scherf's miseiable life. In her girl
hood she was pretty Katie Wilson, the
belle of Butchertown, the lady love of
the vacqueros of South San Francisco.
Her" father was the well known cattle
man, Charles Wilsonâ now deadâ but
his name in Ireland, where he was a
member of a prominent family, was
Charles O'Dougherty. On account of
political trouble in the old country he
dropped his real name. His wife was
one of the Spanish Alviso family.
Alfred W. Parsons, the husband of
Katie O'D. Wilson, befriended Gustav
Scherf in many waysâ picked him up
out of the alleys of Butchertown. where
he was wandering, having lost his em
ployment through drink, and took him
to his house.- Then Scherf ruined his
benefactor's home. Parsons first
learned of his wife's downfall on re
turning from his work one evening
almost a year ago. He was attacked
by Scherf with an iron bar. Mrs. Par
sons assisted Scherf and the husband
was vanquished.
Scherf's mother lives in a cabin-like
structure at 42 Winslow street, near
the top of Bernal Heights.
: "I cried all last night," said this sad
German woman, "and my two sons
came home and cried too. I cried not
so much for myself as for that woman
and the two little children. I have had
lots of trouble in my life, but not so
much as this. But I am old and will
soon be done with it all. I wonder why
everybody carries pistols? Poundmen
have no business to carry pistols. They
have no need of them. My / boy must
take the consequences. I tried tp make
a good man of him. I am sorry for
that poor woman and the two little
children."
