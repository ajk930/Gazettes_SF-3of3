The citadel of Cadi lies a little way

Moors seven hundred years 'ago upon
the summit of a precipitous cliff at
whose foot runs a tributary of the
river Ter. Styled Impregnable 'for
many centuries, it is now but a relic of
the Moorish occupation, of so little ac

this once goodly palace, and writers

and there were other weapons! For her
own suffering he cared nothing. It was
not to be hidden from him that his
worda tortured her; he: intended that
they should. / -J
"You speak In' haste," he said. "Of
course your husband must answer for
himself since the question will be put
to him and not to you. But, madame 1 .
have you no part to play, no/ counsel
to offer him; are you dumb when life is
alone? I think not; I know you better.

"Oh!" she cried, "you speak in rid

"Not so ; I Epeak of, facts. When you

"To po to my husband?" she asked,
bewildered.
"Yes!" he cried, with something of
that pose which always characterized
him, "to go to your husband."
"I love my husband; but he shall
Â¦peak for himself. . Is it a woman's
task to rob him of his birthright? I
have answered you, Doctor Xavier; I
shall never answer otherwise."

had expected no other response. The
bargain he offered her was so little un
derstood. Time must be on his side:
unless â ah, unless, guided by your wis
dom, he resigns nil. abdicates of his
own free will, leaves this kingdom
which he has betrayed. Is it clear to
you, madame; do you understand It
now ?"
He had not cal'.ed Esther "madame"
before, and the sudden change of de
meanor from that of the kindly per
suasive friend to the dictatorial man
ner of the politician and the schemer
declared the true part he was playing.
She saw it all now; there could be*no
disguise. Arthur's life depended upon
this abject surrender of his kingdom
and his birthright. Nothing less would
satisfy those relentless enemies whose
intrigues had been 60 subtle and so
sure. He must give up all, become an
exile from the land of his birth and
permit his cloak to fall upon the shoul
ders of another. Esther knew already
what his answer would be. And her
own? Ehe buried her face In her hands,
afraid to Epeak! She heard the almost
impatient question, and did not dare
to answer it.
"Come, madr.me, I wait for you; is It
posible that you hesitate? Ani I to as
sume that this man's life is nothing to
you? Will you sacrifice it for senti

those circumstances of luxury to which
prudence entitles him. Will you sac
rifice that for a chimera of power?â no.
I do not believe It! You-. will save your
husband because you love himâ a no

She looked up at the words and re

him. i*-A*s

She uttered an exclamation of pro
test, but he continued quickly:

and dismissed it as a folly. But it
â¢would not be dismissed; events com

He delivered th!s defense In a low
pleasing voice which held Esther fas
cinated. The story of her life for the
past seven months seemed to be re
cited page by page by one who knew
and understood every line of it This
man. so subtle, so plausible, defied her
keenest scrutiny. Posing there as the

"Iâ I! Ah. if It were!"

when a carriage set down Esther at
the cliff's foot and Colonel Varez curtly
bade her follow him to the heights.
"It Is a treacherous path, madame,
he said bluntly; "if you are frightened,
do not hesitate to tell me so. I win
give you a hand at the dangerous
places, but you must, be careful."
She answered him that she was not
afraid. The knowledge that she would
B ee her husband, that, perchance, he
knew of her coming, gave her a false
courage and steeled her nerves.
"I learned to climb In Switzerland,"
she said; "I am sure I shall not mind
It. Please go on; I am naturally very
anxious."
He turned without a word, and began
to stride up a rocky path which
bridged many a chasm and bordered
many a black abyss. Torches in giant
crannies diffused their shifting light
upon that dizzy road, and, weaving
Bhadows. they helped the climber to de
ceive himself. Here and there, where
the track turned and a false step
would have sent ths traveler down
headlong to the crags below, Colonel
Varez offered Esther his hand and
dragged her up. The valley shaped be
low them clea,r and distinct in the wan
light; a city in a mighty cup, a haze
of smoke, a river linking range to
range with Its chain of rippling' silver.
These fearsome sights Esther shut out
from her eyes with more than a wo
man's resolution. Her desire to be
with her husband defied all danger.
She had the will to run; the delay tor
tured her; ehe was not conscious of
fatigue; a cold breeze blowing down
from the snows brought the blood to
her cheeks and gave her strength.
"When, at the sate, Colonel Varez
waited to tell her that the Journey was
done, he asked himself why he had not
noticed her beauty before. She found
him more sympathetic henceforth.
"The Duke looks for your answer at
the end of an hour, madame," he said,
-while they crossed the drawbridge and
stood upon the threshold of the keep.
"He desires me to 6ay that this Is the
only interview which will be permitted
you. If you accept this condition,
there is no other stipulation."
She said, "Yes, yes; I quite under
stand;" and a trooper at the Moorish
gate, drawing back heavy bolts, ad
mitted them within the precincts.
Here .a whole company of the guard
loitered at Its ease Jabout the fires
which the cooks had kindled; artillery
men upon the ramparts were break
fasting by the side of their guns. The
number end importance of the guard
Impressed Esther as no mere words
or threats could have done. She under
stood how closely Arthur was watched,
how definite ras hla loss of liberty.
And this " truth the very bullding3
themselves could Impress upon her.
Gate upon gate opened at their ad
vance; vast walls were tunneled that
they might reach other walla not less
vast. The galleries, which once had
echoed the Muezzin's call, now an
ewered to the sentry's tread. At any
other time she would have said that it
was a picture from the dead ages, red
called from the glory of the East to
reanimate these deserted cloisters and
rewrite their story; but dr.-ubt forbada

âI shall still trouble them â "
He appeared to be thir.klnE* deeply,
and. comforting her with a lover's ai
surance he bejan to recite their story
again like one who believed that recital
would supply the link In that chain of
thoueht he forged.

have they treated you â what happened
to you on the road?"
He broached a new subject thus
quickly to forestall her questions. Â¦ A
clever actor, the peril of the role he
played insisted upon a hearing; and
the changing expression of his face, the
puckered brow and the quick glances
to right and left in their turn betrayed
his reservations. Esther knew how
much they had to talk about and yet
the heart of the subject defied her.
Arthur fenced too adroitly for that.
He desired that she should speak chief
ly of herself.
"Tell me," he persisted, "what hap
pened upon the roadâ how did y"6u
leave the castle â who brought y,0^
here?"
She answered as directly.
"When you left me In the bedroom, I

whose hand rested knuckle downward
upon the pavement. He did not hear
the Intruders, his sleep was dreamless;
but burning lips upon hla own waked
him. and, starting up. he caught the
little figure in his arms.
"Esther! it is Esther! Of course it
would be! And I fell asleepâ yes, I havÂ»

He laughed boyishly, and still ho!<j-

for she knew how greatly she waÂ«

the mob, if anything, more dense; the
sunshine more brilliant. The outcry
died down as suddenly as It had arisen.
The people waited patiently when the
knife did not clinch their arguments.
She returned to the fireside, and stir
ring the lagging embers, drew her chair
close to them. Ages seemed to pass
before the merry trooper returned, full
of the story of the morning. She ques
tioned him eagerly, forgetful of her
dignity, desirous only to know. He re
plied as readily, for he was proud of
the authority of knowledge.
The Prince, he said, carried himself
splendidly. His appearance In the
streets pleased the people. The priests
were on his side but the bourgeoisie
were against him. His judges took
their orders from the Duke of Montal
van and were not to be trusted. The
Prince's answers had embarrassed
them exceedingly. They charged him
with receiving money from the French
Government and intriguing with the
Carllsts. But the count of treachery
was one upon which they chiefly relied.
He would have sold Cadi to Franca,
they said, in return for a command In
the French arrriy and the Income of a
Prince. Of the more personal indict
ment this honest fellow had the sense
to say nothing. He did not tell her
that her own name had moved the
crowd to a frenzy of anger, that she
was spoken of as one in the pay of the
French Government, styled **Â» well
known adventuress, by whose Intrigue
the Prince had been inreijUd to Eng
land." An honest fellow, he held his
tongue about this. Why should he
grieve her* He believed that she
would hava enough to softer by and by.
"Mother Guanares is In the kitchen,"
he said. "I promise you something
good for breakfast The win* la the
white stone of the loftiest buildings.
The steps of the hotel were a glittering
sheen of rainbow hues, to which the
crimson i robes of the Judges # and the
white uniforms of the guard lent their
staring contrasts. The crowd Itself
swayed like a shimmering field of hu
man corn. Fierce but brief tumults de
clared the latent passion of angry par
ties. The gendarmes were everywhere,
cajoling-, threatening, beating the peo
ple back.with the flats of their swords.
All seemed to wait for some figure ne
cessary to the pageant and its story.
Esther knew that they waited for her
husband. She needed.no logician's wit
to understand that she had- been Im
prisoned in that very apartment to be
the spectator of Arthur's humiliation.
SOch *a' shallow device " earned j her Just
scorn. She resolved that she would
yield nothing to persecution or to
"You haven't thought of It,' I sup
pose, madame, or It would not be news

He was a cheery gossip, who bustled
about the room and performed.unne
cesary services in an unnecessarily
clumsy, way. Knowing something of
the circumstances In which an English
lady had become a prisoner In the'Bar-
tlzan Tower, he yet pretended ignor

were a fete day in'the Joys of which he
could not participate.
overlooked. She foresaw that this very
paper might be used In evidence
against tha man they would condemn.
She feared to commit herself, feared
her refusal! The thread of an answer
would be caught up In her -mind to be
lost Immediately in a tangle of her ar
guments. Had she but one friend in
Cadi, then might word have been sent
to Paris and its Government. But she
knew that she had none. Never had
she been more utterly alone.
The pen tumbled from her unwilling
fingers â she said that she would an
swer nothing. Colonel Varez found her
new resolve unshaken when he -re
turned at' the appointed time. He had
not expected It, for; like many, in the
city, he believed that she was an ad
venturess and - would - sell - herself rfor
money.
"L fear you did not understand me,
"Your ministry is most discreet!"
she retorted. "I am glad to see that I
am so important a personage. When
this preposterous charge is a little
more definite, I shall be quite ready to
defend myself. Really, I must be a
very clever woman!"
He bowed gravely, for no man had
seen Colonel Varez smile; and calling
to a trooper who waited upon the stair
case, he bade him bring paper and
pens.
"I am merely the servant, madame;
permit me to decline any argument.
The Duke awaits your answer In a
matter which Is more urgent. Please
make it as soon as possible; I will re
turn In half an hour."
He strode from the room, and the
heavy door shut with a clang which
re-echoed through the empty building.
A trooper had left a sheet of paper
with pen and ink upon the table, and
for a while Esther stood wondering
what she should write and with what
unknown' consequences. She was still
wearing the winter cloak in which she
had gone to the citadel, and her first
act was to loose it and throw It over
the wooden chair, where Its bright lin
ing of pink silk gave a patch of wel
come color to that dismal place. There
after she knelt before the fire and
warmed her chilled fingers and shud
dered a little in that atmosphere of
damp and evil humors. The plain fact
that the gates of a prison had closed
upon her at last troubled her less than
the base intrigue which would hava
made her the agent of her husband's
compliance. Though she had been pre
pared for threats and entreaties, a cer
tain confidence In the ultimate triumph
of Justice had upheld her until this
time; but here, within this cell, hope
Now, at last, she knew the truth of her
position; and her sense of humor re
maining to her, she could laugh at the
folly which named her as a servant of
France.
Colonel Varez carried her message to
the ministry at seven o'clock, and at
eight the trooper entered' her cell with
coffee and bread. She welcomed this
intrusion and was grateful for the fogd
he offered her. Her grief had left her
weak and cold; and when the first pas
sion of it was over, she sat for a ful\

defied her and she would not barter
with It. Her love-dream, so brief, was
surely done with now! She saw herself
cast out to the world to mourn eter
nally the man without whom life had
no meaning. '"When she staggered^ up
from her knees the pallor of death was
upon her face, her eyes were blind so
that she could scarcely find the paper.
She sank heavily into the chair, and for
many minutes did not raise her face
from those arms which hid it from the
light.
What should she write? What must
her answer be to him who so tortured
her, who had found her out in London
but seven months ago and saved her
for this! Better, she said, that it had
ended then; better the degradation, the
poverty/ the humiliation than this vi
sion of the dream, this knowledge of
love and light and the surpassing hour
of woe. She had not asked the help of
any man. Destiny might have spared
her so easily! And now she must repay
to the uttermost farthing for her brief
respite. If she could but stand with
Arthur before' his judges to answer
them as he would answer them, to hear
their judgment and suffer it, then, in
deed, might this self-accusation avail
her. But she knew that the wish was
vain. The dread thought came to her
that the eternal farewell might have
been spoken. She sobbed aloud, heart
broken and believing the worst.
The minutes passed slowly in a si
lence upon which neither the city's
voice nor any sound within the prison
intruded. Esther could hear her own
heart beating as she took up the pen
and set il down again upon an empty
page. What should she write? How
should she answer them? Should she
say that her husband counted upon the
justice of his countrymen? Should she
defend him? Or should it be the bold
defiance, threat for threat, the braver
resolution? The cleverness which cc-m-

she regarded it with open-eyed aston

to the sham courtesies of yesterday.
ace which, though she knew it not,
was called "the prison." Massive
walls, loopholed windows, spoke of the
antiquity of the Princes of Cadi five
hundred years ago, and In the days of
Spain's bigotry many an offender had
breathed his laet within those gloomy
portals. Here, upon the first floor, in
that which ence had been the barti
zan of the fortress, an apartment was
prepared for Esther, bo cheerless, so
bare, that no priso-n cell would have
spoken more eloquently of captivity.
Damp-stained walls displayed no other
ornament than that of their wheels of
swords and rusted armor. Save for one
little casement overlooking the square
before the Hotel de Ville, the windows
were but loopholes In battlements of
rock. A gigantic fireplace, with a rude
oaken ingle, nursed a smoldering fire of
steaming logs. The air reeked of damp
and disuse. One solitary chair set
against a table that would not have
adorned a kitchen. The sunbeams fall

or barracks, there marching with flags
flying and drums rolling 1 , now escorting
a minister or riding at a canter to the
rendezvous before the great Hotel de
.Ville. The air of unrest was universal.
Esther's quick eyes detected the barri
cades before the shops; she read men's
faces, and could imagine that but one
story occupied her mind. They were
asking what verdict must be pro
"nounced by Arthur's Judges to-day.
Would it be life or death, sunshine or
the darkness, the Judgment of mercy or
the pitiless decree of the dictator and
the rebel? Would this kingdom re
rounce the son of those who for five
hundred years had preserved her free
dom, or could she recall the tradition of
her loyalty and save him even yet? Es
ther* knew not. She could learn no
thing from those active scenes and
troabled faces. The soldier by her side
c sat stern and silent. A day of gentle
breezes and dazzling, sunlight mocked
* the passions which stfrred all hearts.
The carriage went rapidly, as though
the driver feared recognition. In the
courtyard of the palace Esther per

aside so lightly the reality of to-day.

not. know, I have not counted them.
But you can see it all, madame, if you

Esther heard with surprise. From
her window she could look down upon
the square before the Hotel de Ville,
and upon the crowds already gathered
there; and she wondered that curiosity
had not sent her there before. Though
the scene was viewed from afar, no de
tail of its picture escaped her. Every
window, every roof, tree and wall and f
threats, and withdrawing from the
window she sat again at the table and
drank her coffee and ate the sour
bread, and shut her ears to the omi
nous cries.
The bells of the cathedral, muffled by
those tremendous walls, chimed the
hour of eleven before the brief repast
was over. If she had any consolation of
suspense, it was that the ordeal must
be brief. She could see it so clearly In
her mind; the dimly lighted court, the
blazing uniforms, the scarlet robes,
the stern figures â one man against a
nation, and he alone! Loyalty to he*

she cried bitterly; "it is so snfÂ» to In

"You are aware that he Is free, then."
"The ministry compels it,** he said,
folding his hands behind his back and
pacing the stone floor like one think

will not hear me. Evil tongues have
been at work, madame; they pay you
the compliment of calling you a Â«py.**
She laughed a little bitterly.
"I am flattered." she said. "I did not
know that I possessed tha brains for

"Then you are Â«lngralarly modest,
madame. I should say that you ha.vÂ«
too much brains to be any such thins;

The hours found her attltudo un
changed. She was unconscious of tlmo
or place, oblivious of self. An excited
imagination painted for her anew the
terrible story of the day and corrected
the brighter picture. She beheld the
crowded court, the set faces of thÂ»
Judges, the beloved figure at the bar;
Â»he heard the musin of a voice, the
monotone of counsel, the judgment.
"He is guilty!" Ar.d then her prayer
would be raise,' anew end she would
say, "Folly, folly! it is not true â he is
free â he v.ill come to me."
The crowd without dispersed quickly
when judgment had been pronounced â
the women to their homes, the men to
the cafes. If an unwonted restlessness
stirred the city, but little expression of
it C7as permitted in th/s streets. By
nine o'clock the square before the Ho
tel de Vilie had resumed Its normal aa
pect save for the patro! of thd guard
and the vigilant gendarmes. Night
came down in the mantle of spring; a
gentle breeze wafted the musio of bells;
the moonbeams fathomed thÂ» crabbed
streets and shone gloriously In tho opun
squares. Within the prison there was
no sound save of the chapel bell
and the sentry's foot. As the night
wore on and none visited her, Esther's
anguish passed all words. "Would they
never teil her â would none take piiy
on her? This torturing question was
answered all unexpectedly by nona
other than Francisco Xavler himself,
who came to, the palace at ten o'clock,
carrying a lantern and unheralded. Es
ther said that he entered her cell like a
figure of some evil dream, but she did
not shrink from him; he found her the
mistress of herself and cf her dignity.
And his first word was characteristi
cally apologetic.
"Madame," he said. "I am very sorry
to find you In this place."
She bowed her head and waited for
him to go on. When the trooper had
brought a pair of candles and set them
one at each side of his lantern, tin
Duke bade her seat herself.
The court pronounced Us Judgment
at five o'clock In the afternoon, and nva
mlnute3 later a thunder of sounds In
the great square winged a message to
the lonely prisoner. At first Esther
understood those triumphant cries of
Joy to be the heralds of acquittal, and.
rising with beating heart, she went to
the window and looked out ones more
upon the turbulent scene. It was full
dark by this time, and lights twinkled
In all the windows of the square. Mon
strous arc lamps cast their pal* glow
upon the swaying multitudes, and from
the hotel itself there poured forth an
unbroken human stream of sold!;;-*
and citizens and the audience cf trial.
By every corner. In all the doorways,
even at the windows of the houses, men
argued with men and debated the tre
mendous news: while troopers backed
their horses through the serried ranks
and began to drive the people to their
homes. Passion dominated the seen â¢Â»
and even claimed its dead, but no one
spoke that word which had been as a
gift of love or death to the figure at the
window. Though the pressed her burn
ing eye close to the misted glass and
listened intently to that babel of voices,
the torture of the doubt remained. Wa3

Carriage after carriage drove at a gal

thought, "He 13 condemned â Arthur is

THE SAN ' FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALI1
3The troops entered the city at eight
o'clock, and rumors of the miracle her
alded their approach, and brought anx
ious faegs to every window. The doors
of the churches stood open now, and
priests there awaited confirmation of
the wonder. The very poor accepted
the story without question, saying that
Inez of Cadi had come down from the
mountains to save their Prince's life!
Beggars bared their sores, cripples
dragged themselves to the payement's
edge and lay there blinking In the sun-
He cast down his eyes and stood ir
resolute. His troops caught the saying,
and repeated it from man to man.
"She is the Prince's wife â an omen,
friends! Heard you that? She asks
his life!" Anon they shouted altogether,
"Grace, grace! lead us down!"
The stern face wore a more kindly
look when next it was lifted to Es
ther's. â¢ .Â¦Â¦':
"Madame," he said, "how shall I
answer 'these men?" .
"As a faithful friend to one who will

"You shall lead them!" he said.
He turned to the, troops and repeated
her saying: \ ;
"Here is one who will lead you to
your Prince; how shall it be, my men
â will you follow her?"
A mighty shout justified him.
"Viva, Inez!" they cried,, "we follow
â we follow!"
They called the colonel out, and Es
ther looked up quickly when she heard
his voice. Varez stood before herâVa
rez, the silent, the masterful.'"*He car
ried papers in his hands; his head was
bare. News of Xavier's death had. just
come to him; his sword lay In the bal
ance; and he cast It from scale to scale
like a man doubtful of the issues. For
he knew that the night had changed
all, and that it might yet save the
Prince. When he perceived the figure
upon the horse, the blue robe and the
golden stars, the faith of his youth
brought the blood to his cheeks and
sent a nervous hand to the hilt of his
sword. For the moment even he could
not read the riddle.
"Speak!" he cried; "what does this
woman do here?"
A thousand voices lifted the cry,
"Viva, Inez!"
He looked about him at the wonder

the old x priest's uplifted arms. So he

amid the roses. And now the same
cloak served her in this remote place!
â¢Ita hood was drawn over her head, its
ample folds fell upon the ground at her
feet. The Moor regarded her approv
ingly * â¢â¢ * the black eyes expressed
pleasure.
'.'Senora," he said, "here is your
horse. It is time. for us to show our
selves to the people."
A man brought a white horse from
a stable near by, and a pillion being
already upon its back, Esther was lift
ed there and took the reins between
her nerveless fingers. She knew noth
ing of that which they would do, nor
had she any hope other, than that
which would carry her speedily to Ar
thur's side. When they began to go
very carefully down the hillside toward
the white tents below she believed that
the road lay to the city and the prison.
In the camp itself, a new activity drew
the troopers from their tents and sent
the officers pell-mell for arms and
horses. News of the Spaniard's death
had just come to these outposts, and it
passed as tidings of a visitation which
would unite their nation's story. The
autocrat was dead, then! Vengeance
had struck him down: his enemies had
triumphed; his voice had been heard
in the city's councils for the last time.
Prophets predicted that reaction would
be swift to Come. Others, who were no
prophets, allowed the magnitude of the
blo-w and its possible consequences. "It
will help the Prince," they said; "it
may give him all!" The more timid
reminded themselves that Arthur of
Cadi was to be shot at nine o'clock;
they heard the cathedral .bell summon
ing the city to hear his last mass. And
by these the figure of the woman was
first perceived. They touched each
other upon the arm, crying, "Look yon
der!" A white horse upon the hillside,
a* blue robe, a fragile figure, a face of
surpassing sweetness â there was noth
ing here to command alarm; neverthe
less the curious pressed about the
travelers and crossed themselves in
awe. Fanatics exclaimed.^ "It is Inez
of Cadi, a miracle, a miracle!" A priest
fell upon his knees and touched the
earth with his forehead. The doubting
had the will to laugh, but held their
tongues notwithstanding. To all of
whom the Moor answered nothing, nor
wouid he open his lips to any man. His
way lay to the colonel's tent. Esther
herself^but vaguely understood what
legend awed the troopers or why they
crossed themselves at her coming. Mo
ment by moment the buzz of wonder
and surprise lifted a stronger voice and
became a violent clamor. Men stretched
out their hands to touch the hem of
her garment. Many tried to run at the
horse's head and to lead him; but the
Moor beat them back. When he spoke
they heard him with wonder.
"I bring you the wife of your Prince,"
he said.
They answered, "Viva, Viva!" All
the teachings of their race predisposed
them to belief. The more Ignorant
prostrated, themselves before that
which they deemed a miracle. The
wiser, hearing the name, believed It
was an omen, A thousand excited men
clamored about the horse when the
Moor demanded admittance to the col
onel's tent. Like news of a triumph
the word went from ear to ear, "Inez
of Cadi rides down from the moun
tains!" Salvos of welcome were heard
on the distant ramparts; the guard
beat the mob back with the butts of
their muskets.
"I must see your colonel," the Moor
said, with the lofty utterance of one
who ha's a mandate. "Let him know
that I am here." ,
"We must not go alone; Jhe air. is
keen, senora. Please wrap your cloak
about youâ closerâ closer. Let me see
how well you look in itâ ah, the cheeks
are bright now, the eyes speak again.
Rise up, senoraâ the hour has come!"
She understood but little of that
which he did. The bright blue cloak in
which he had wrapped her was familiar
and recalled an impression of the past.
She had worn it beforeâ but where, she
asked. Memory, gathering strength of
her impatience, told her at last; she
had worn it in Francisco Xavier's
house on the night when Arthur came!
She remembered how he had called her
Inez of Cadi, and had watched her
"Where am I?" she ksked wildly.
"What is It, Yussuf, what has hap
pened?"
"Senora," he said quietly, "much has
happened. A man is dead who deserved
to. die. I know his life; he deserved to
die. Youâ you know nothing; you were
not as the others!"
She did not understand him; her
thoughts were Inconsequent and capri
cious. The present compelled her rues
tions. What had happened? How had
she escaped the cell?
"You must tell me everything," was
her passionate command; "I have the
right to know. Where' Is. my husband
â where are you taking me?"
"To him, â¢ senora, in . my own time.
Listen: the French have forbidden his
death, but. the people may demand it.
I do not know; the day will tell us.
Yussuf is your * friendâ he has been
your friend many months. Obey s him
and he will be your servant. Here is
the Inn â we shall breakfast, senora."
The carriage stopped as he spoke be
fore the door of an ,inn which lay a
mile to the south of the city's ram
parts. The road had carried them up
ward toward the pine forests and the
pass. Countless white tents of the reg
iments, called in to quell the tumults,
dotted the grassland; and troopers
moved briskly from door to door, their
blue uniforms looking brighter" 1 still in
the sunshine. Â¦ The city itseft lay
wreathed still In the morning mists;
bells chimed the Angelus, muffled and
indistinctly. .
Her obedience to the Moor was un
questioning. Odd, indeed, tliat of all
the /riends whom had sent,
this man alone remained to befriend
her. Her faith in him was absolute.
She believed that he would take her to
her husband. *'Â». , ! f Â¦ Â¦

for Â«ine o'clock. God help us to be In
time, senora!" â¢ -
She paled at his words,. and stood up
at once. She knew of what he spoke.
The word recalled instantly the threat
of yesternight, the trial, the. document.
"Take me to * himâ now!" she ex
claimed. '- - * â¢
His eyes lighted with a certain pleas
ure at her impatience.
In a carriage driven swiftly away
from the southern ramparts of Cadi,
Esther opened her eyes when a quarter
of an hour had passed and perceived
that the sun was shining. A swarthy
figure upon the seat before her regard
ed her with a woman's tender eyes.
She did not know why the Moor sat
there or recollect the circumstance of
her deliverance. , ' Â¦ x ,
"Senora!" he said, "look upâ it Is the
day!"
"It is Iâ Estherâ I am here! They
have killed Doctor Xavier â please help
me! Oh, my God, what shall I do!"
The Moor caught the outstretched
hand m an iron grip, and held up the
fragile figure which fell swooning in
his arms. He lifted it as a trivial bur
den and flung a cloak about its face.
Keys at his girdle opened the heavy
door and admitted him to the court
yard. None challenged him in the
sunny court without. The sentry read
his passport as the merest formality.
"So France has saved the little Eng
lish woman!"
It was the man's only comment.
â¢ * *
The summons came, oddly enough,
not from the courtyard before the Bar
bican Tower, but from that room of
shadows she had fled in such terror.
For an Instant a terrible suspicion al
most stilled her heart. Was it Xavier
who spoke, or another? She peered
into the envelope .of darkness, vainly
trying to discern a face. A man was
descending the narrow Staircase with
stealthy tread.- His white bernouse
took shape in the straggling light; his
long brown robe trailed upon the stairs.
She knew that it was Yussuf, the Moor,
and with a sob of relief and joy she
stretched out â¢ her â¢ hands to him and
bade him hasten.
Esther remembered at this time the
n;erry trooper, and how he had spoken
of the mother Guanares and of her
presehce in the prison.- It was her con
solation to assure herself that the man
would return to her cell at daybreak,
bringing her chocolate and the gossip
of the barrack-room. She counted the
minutes until he should come* fever
ishly afraid even of the morning light
and half belfcving that the dead man
still lived. When she heard a voice at
last, she believed that the. tropper
spoke and she staggered to her feet and
responded like one snatched from a liv
ing tomb.
"Yes, yesâ who is it?â I am here!"
case, ar.d whsn the reluctant dawn
came straggling through the' loopholed
windows, she stood up with numbed
limbs and Woodless fingers, saying that
day must bring release. Already a
faint murmur of the city's wakening
life sent its message even to that close
retreat. She heard the reveille sounded
in the distant barracks. Jangling bells
summoned the peasantry to mass; a
sergeant's voice commanded the chang
ing of the guard. For the, second time
she would have raised the alarm, and
beating loudly upon the door she
thought to make the sentries hear her;
but none responded, none answered to
her kne-ck.
"Under other circumstances. Con
sider: your husband Is obeying a fool
ish hallucination. He will go to the
scaffold for a tradition five hundred
years too old for the age; one person
alone can zave him. The city, names
you as the agent of his downfall; It re
fuses to regard you as his wife. If you
She regarded him unflinchingly. â¢
"And the. word? Oh, I understand
that I must pay. You offer me some
thing; what is it?"
"Your husband's life, your own lib
erty, an honorable position in England,
a generous recompense from my Gov
ernmentâthose are my proposals."
"You have made that offer before."
She pushed the parchment from her,
for she knew that when it was signed
Arthur would not have an hour to live.
Such a challenge failed utterly if It
were meant to shake her resolution.
She left the paper upon the table and
resumed her old attitude.
"Why do you show me that?" she
aeked, a little absently; "what has It
to do with me?"
"So much that at a word from you
I will burn it in yonder embers."
He laughed at his own mistake and
took another paper from the pocket of
his cape.
"I had forgotten," he said; "that Is
the document. Read it carefully and
note that there is a line left blank.
Some one must sign the paper pres
ently; ah! you cannot seeâ shall I read
it, then?"
"I admit nothing," she said; "my
husband has answered you once for
all."
"Then your husband is an obstinate
fool, lady. Will he sacrifice his life for
an empty throne which he has no de
sire to fili? I do not believe it. He
has too much sense â he knows that we
are wise enough to be generous. I, my
self, will answer for his honor before
Europe. What more does he ask? I
tell you that he is mad to refuse."
"He asks for justice," was her
quiet response; "what right have you
to judge him? None â you have none!"
He crossed the room and laid a paper
upon the table before her.
"There Is my authority, madame," he
cried, as one aping the manner of the
theater. "Oblige me by admitting it!"
Esther took the paper in her nervous
fingers and turned to the table to read
it. The light was dim and uncertain;
he held a candle that she might see,
and, holding It, could detect the rapid
beating of her heart and the hot blood
which flushed her cheeks while she
read.
"It is not in English," she exclaimed
presently; "I do not understand Span
ish, Doctor Xavier."
He paused, believing that her curi
osity would interrupt him, but she had
nothing to say and he resumed:
"Yes, a task which the night must
finish or the day will find forever un
done. I fear it is that, madame â to say
'yes* or 'no' before the sunrise or to
hold our tongues forever." .
She quailed at the threat, but she did
not lift her eyes or protest that it was
otherwise. Her hesitation satisfied him.
He continued in a more decided tone:
"When I sent you to the citadel this
morning it was in my head that you^
would achieve nothing. The circum
stances were changing, the end uncer
tain. I foresaw that you would be
guided by events. The verdict might
be in your favor or the people vacillat
ing; there was still a hope of French
action. The day has altered all that;
we are confronted with fresh facts and
must consider them. At least you will
admit that it is different?"
"I Fhall not trouble you with any
particulars/' he resumed, falling to
the monotonous step again like one
upon a quest of words; "the court has
heard the evidence and has found our
friend guilty. The rest is our work.
I told you this morning: when I sent
for you to the crtadel that you could
save the Prince; you chose to ignore
my warning. It would be a craven
act to remember that you did so: I
forget it, madame. I am content that
v/e begin anew a task 'which the night
must finish."
"Thai is the judgment of the court,"
he repeated unctuously; "it may or
may not be final, madame." .
"I understand youâ God help me!"
she said.
He was not displeased that she
should meet him frankly. Like a
shrewd merchant he knew that this
was the hour of sale and barter. He
had> much to* offer; she had something
to sftve.
She drew fhe ciiair to the fireside
at his bidding, her chin resting- upon
her hands, her arms vcpon her knees.
The ebb and flow of the flickering
blaze touched her pale face with the
tides of light. Her eyes were tearless,
her nerves quivering. He understood
what silince cost her.
She tried to speak, but her voice
failed. Though her face was turned
from him he could hear her Bobbing
Jike a child in the silence of the night.
"Your husband, madame," he said,
in a tone so low that she could scarce
ly hear him, "your husband has been
found guilty by his judges and will be
shot at dawn."
She turned and faced him. He set
down the candle and snuffed the wick
wilh his fir.gers. His task was prov
ing more dhTlcult than he had imagined
it. Her self-ccrmmand baflled him.
"I came," be said at length, "not as
the bearer of III newsâ"
"Ah, it is ill .news, then; I seeâ I see,
you would not be here if it were not.
They condemn my husband, and you
are the first to tell me of it. Thank
you. I am very much obliged."
Her voice had grown a little hysteri
cal, and the irony of grief showed her
to less advantage. Xavier welcomed
his opportunity; he believed that he
t-L-uld profit by It.
He unloosed his cloak and let It fall
back from his shoulder. A flare of the
embers upon the hearth cast out a
ruddy flame and set his face in a frame
of the bro^vn-gold light. The whole
figure was sinister and yet not unim
pressive. It might have betn that of
a great man surprised in* the hour of a
crime.
The story of Esther Venn and her re
lations with the kingdom of Cadi is too
recent in its- more public phase that we
should carry it any further in these
pages. Standing with her husband be
fore the altar of the cathedral of St.
Ignatius, she herself has answered
those evil tongues which a woman's
victory must ever loosen. Henceforth
her life is to be lived In that old-world
palace, wherefrom for a thousand years
the princes of her city have ruled a
willing people. By faith she conquered,
by love will she be justified. She was
CHAPTER XXII.
They knelt together before the altar,
and the old priest blessed them. Sun
shine was upon their faces, joy in their
hearts. To the God of their destinies
they offered their hearts and their lives.
But the people still cried, "A miracle!"
Esther has confessed that her mem
ory of this last great scene is but fitful
and unsure. From the moment when
Yussuf, the Moor, carried her from the
prison she was scarcely the mistress
of her own actions, and she heard and
saw all things as in a picture or her
sleep. Even the words she spoke were
forgotten. She could recollect nothing
of her appeal to Colonel Varez, or the
act which had placed her at the head
of his troops. Thereafter she lived for
an hour in wonderland. The madness
of worship sounded in her ears like the
murmur of a distant sea. She beheld
countless faces, and carried the image
of some of themâ the faces of loving
women, of beggars by the wayside, of
old priests at their church doors. For
the rest, the panorama changed too
quickly that she could recollect It.
Street succeeded to street, throng to
throng; she perceived the multitudes
above, the multitudes below; she heard
the 3welllng music, the clatter of the
hoofs. But her thoughts wers always
carrying her forniiid, over th<Â» thrjnqs
as upon the wings of impatience to the
great churchyard and its golden altars.
They Â¦ told her afterward that men
would have lifted her from her horse
at the church door but that she denied
their right; and, riding in, entered
without question, like one whose Jour
ney was not yet done. In the cafhe
dral itself twenty thousand worshipers
heard the ringing hoofs upon the mar
ble flags and bent their heads before
the vision. Blue-robed priests at the
altar staved their ministrations and
turned to see who came. One man
alone awaited the messenger with con
fidence; his sword trailed upon the
marble floor,, beams of the radiant light
fell through the crimson glass and
struck down upon his gold cuirass; his
face was flushed, his arms outstretched
to the figure of his salvation. He it
was who lifted the figure from the
horse, he who held the trembling girl
in his strong arms and cried: ' ,
"My wife! my wife!"
A roar of sounds hailed the truth
and confessed the legend. Many knelt
and were half crushed with the press;
priests raised their hands in blessing;
strong men were silent and awed. Min
ute by minute the cavalcade drew
nearer, the music of the bands swelled
out In cadences more solemn, the pen
nons flutterjed on the breeze in Increas
ing numbers. The moments of wait
ing were intolerable by this time. Who
came then? What story was this? A
young girl riding upon a white horse,
what did she there? With one re
sounding note the people named her.
"Inez of Cadi!" they wailed, "it is Inez
of Cadi!" The salvos followed her to
the cathedral door. She entered there
like one whom all would worship.
To this city, careworn and resolute,
the messengers came down at the zen
ith of the hour. "Inez of Cadi in at the
head of two thousand!" they said. The
news. went as a voice of winds. Born
in superstition, the ignorant prostrated
themselves before the omen and ran
fanatically to greet it. The wiser shook
their heads and knew not what the
saying might mean. Priests called for
their robes and bade the faithful be
patient. Unrest and expectancy were
everywhere; little groups gathered at
all the corners, and were moved on by
a stern scldiery. Many a roof was
black with people; the great piazza be
fore the cathedral could not contain
the multitude.
For a full hour the burning curiosity
of these things went unsatisfied. Some
denied the messengers, some scoffed, a
very few were indifferent. Doubt had
wrestled with desire and won the
throw â¢ â¢ â¢ but upon this the dis
tant rolling of drums was heard, and a
low volley of human voices welcomed
the figure of the miracle.
"Varez rides in!" they said, and then,
"It is not Varez, but another!" '
Soon the pageant shaped itself; the
sunlight fell upon the silver lances, the
silver and gold of that shining capari
son. Those above who had said that
Varez was at the head of the troop re
called their words, and named another
for the leader.
"It is a woman!" they exclaimed. And
then louder. "It is Inez of Cadi!"
shine. For the strife of parties ceased
at the momentous news of Xavier's
death; and the temper of reaction be
gan to make itself felt. A vo!te-face
worthy of a southern race alarmed the
partisan and encouraged the loyal. Men
said that no ministry would dare to go
on until events shaped more clearly
and the ground of opinion was proved.
The people were dazed before this se
quence of alarms. Some said that
Xavier's party would stake all upon
the throw, and hurrying the condemned
to execution would profit by his death.
Others hoped in France and had rumor
at their back. Day found a waking
city agape for the tides of fate. Al
most with the dawn a considerable
throng pressed about the cathedral
doors and waited for that solemn mo
ment when the man they had sworn
to serve should hear the holy office for
the last time. The market-place, the
park, the piazza swarmed with troops
looking for an emeute. Bells tolled
dismally; the crowd spoke in timid
whispers. The cafes were shuttered,
the shops all closed.
"The curse of God be upon your
palsied limbs!" â a maniac spoke and
laughed horribly â "as you sowed so
shall you reap â now-Â«now !"
He fell headlong and she stabbed the
prone body again and again. The lan
tern crashed upon the stone pavement;
the taole was overturned; the room lay
in darkness save for the ebbing glow of
the waning flre. None intruded upon
the scene; none came between the wo
man and the man. The awful laugh
ter subsided anon in a low groaning
sound as of a^ mother fondling a child.
To this silence succeeded; the shuffling
step was heard descending the stairs
one by one as though escape were a
labor. *r
Night engulfed the messenger of
death; Esther was alone, and the door
of her prison stood open.

speak of him; he will be generous to

"To his protection â how dare you?"
"Bear Â¦ with me. In the history of
every court there is such a story as
yoursâ the wife whom governments
will not recognize and princes must
forget. I am compelled to speak frank
ly. You can save my Prince from the
scaffold; why should I Deat about the

upon the cross that we will keep faith
with him. Let it be here and now the
solemn bond between us â ah! folly, you
ask his life, then â you send him to the
open grave."
He stepped back, the words broken
abruptly upon his lips. Her cry of an
ger and shame echoed like a low moan
in the silence of the night. Until that
moment he had never understood her
truly; but when she confronted him
for the last time, with blazing eyes
and heaving breast, and hands clenched
and cheeks on fire, he knew the wo
man and said that he had failed.
"Go!" she cried, a passion of hate
and despair breaking her voice; "if it
were my last word, I say got"
Her anger frightened him. It had
been no surprise to him if she had
fallen dead at his feet. Nevertheless,
he did not spare her â he had expected
such an outbreak.
"Since that is your answer, madame,"
he said deliberately, "I will return you
mine. Here are pens and ink â I am
going to sign this document without
delay."
She stood to watch him, quivering
like a leaf which a hot wind of night
Is blowing. He did not take his eyes
from her face while he spread out the
paper and felt for the mouth of the
inkstand with the pen which the troop
er had provided. When he had signed
the paper and dried the ink at the can
dle's flame, he would have continued
had he not been aware that the door
of the cell stood open and that some
one had entered It silently. A premo
nition of danger for which he could not
account stilled the word upon his lips
and sent his hand to his sword. A
figure from the shadows advanced with
shuffling step. It was that of a wo
man, gaunt and wan and terrible.
She shuffled up to him and her face
took shape in the aureole of the light.
Xo word was spoken; she did not ac
cuse himâ asked nothing, declared no
intention. Some dreadful apparition
might have loomed up out of the stilly
night to break the word from the man's
lips and hold a young girl fascinated.
Esther, indeed, moved neither hand nor
limb. A scene long forgotten was being
enacted again before her startled eyes.
Once again she waited in the'garden of
roses; the fountain splashed in the sun
shine; a vain woman babbled vainly;
a face looked down upon her from a
Â¦window; she was afraid but silent.
And now she saw the fate again, the
hollow cheeks, the hectic flush, the
withered skin, the outstanding bones,
the lust of vengeance in the staring
eyes. And the man, no less, shrank
back; the pen tumbled from his hand,
great drops of sweat stood upon his
forehead.
"Who are you? what do you want?"
he cried, hoarsely.
The woman answered with resound
ing shrieks heard far beyond the prison
walls â a knife flashed in the air: she
struck at his throat and the blood
gushed out upon her arms and tattered
gown.
THE END.
He sealed his letter and sent it to
France to be her witness. If he wc-uld
have added aught, it had been that the
dawn broke upon a sleepless city, and
that tha voice of the multitude was
Esther's lullaby. The sunshine fell
upon her tired face and found her
dreaming. She slept upon her lover's
heart. Â»
We say that by her awn act in the
cathedral of St. Ignatius she saved her
husband's life, and this claim the years
have justified. Though she knew it
not, a straw had turned the people's
temper upon the day of his miraculous
deliverance. Francisco Xavier's tragic
end found a ministry unready and a
senate bewildered. While the timid
would have abandoned all, shielding
themselves behind the status quo. the
more resolute planned a tour de forte
which knew no law but that of misht.
Thus it befell that while one party
would annul the judgment and open
the prison gates, the other stood reso
lutely to its purpose and demanded
that the law should take its course. It
is true the French Government had al
ready determined to depart from its
accepted practice, and to interfere fi/r
the first time in twenty years in the
affairs of this little kingdom. But di
plomacy Is slow and riot speedy. At
the best mandate of France would have
saved Prince Arthur from the scaffold
if it had saved him at all. His life
hung upon a thread. The French sec
retary, Alfonse Manin, has admitted in
a letter to the Minister in Paris that
the thread had snapped but for a wo
man's courage and the faithful friend
ship which served in that hour of need.
"Colonel Varez has saved the day,"
the secretary wrote. "The allies he
found could exist nowhere but in this
city of legends. It is early yet to esti
mate precisely the extent to which the
people have acted upon their supersti
tions and the part which common sense
has played in their decision. Esther
Venn, whose marriage must now be
recognized by Europe, appealed suc
cessfully to a people long taught to ad
mire her race and to imitate it. She 13
clever, quick, undoubtedly courageous,
and her beauty will become a tradition.
I count It not a little remarkable that
a pupil of the dead man, Xavier de
Montalvan, should be the agent of hi3
undoing. It will be known to your Ex
cellency that this man's story is largely
one of those intrigues which blackened
an extraordinary character and pros
trated genius at the footstool of in
famy. That he was the possessor of a
vast intellect, I do not deny; that he
was the enemy of woman is equally
true. For years his leisure appears to
have been devoted to effeminate studies
which, by their very nature, unfitted
him for the healthier tasks. It is clear
that when first he met the English girl
he had no other objects than those
which must have been apparent to all
the world: but the arrival of Prince
Arthur at his house, and the interest
which was awakened by a very beauti
ful protegee, diverted his aims and
fathered this conspiracy. I have no
doubt that he believed the Prince's ruin
would be consummated by marriagr.
It was his object to keep his Highness
permanently away from Cadi. When
he found that prudence guided his mas
ter less than inclination, and that he
would return here in spite" of all, then,
and not until then, he resolved upon
his trial, and, it may be, his death. I
have already informed your Excellency
of the circumstances which have con
spired to defeat him. That he should
fall by a woman's hand is a just Ne
mesis with which none will quarrel. I
believe him to have been the enemy of
French interests and the paid servant
of Spain. Now that he is dead none
regrets him. The city has been drugged
for many months past by smooth
tongued agitators, who applauded bon
dage and cried heaven to witness that
a dictator would save the republic.
â¢ â¢ â¢ Their influence being removed,
the spontaneous loyalty of a servile
race is very ready to assert itself.
Writing to-night in my rourn overlook
ing the church of St. Ignatius, I must
turn to a dead age to recall a scene of
national rejoicing so abandoned and so
picturesque. Modernity has lost its en
thusiasms. We can wave a flag and
ring a bell, perhaps dine overwell at
the Cafe Anglais, or sup with a becom
ing air of dissipation at any restaurant
which robbery has made famous. But
this abandonment of joy, this surrender
to the primitive instincts, is found only
among half-civilized people. Here in
the^stree^s before my eyes -are hillmen
dressed as their forefathers were in
the days of the crusaders. Women
dance about the beacon-fires, and their
jet-black hair streams out like ban
nerets upon the wind. The fountains
are running wineâ so at least the reel
ing figures lead me to believe. I, count
a hundred torches in a space of as
many yards. The sky above glowa
crimson with the flaming lights. Every
cafe is open, every table crowded; men
embrace for joy; young girls rave hys
terically; soldiers, priests, rich and
poor, noble and peasant, swarm to
gether in this frenzy of the night. The
palace is a blaze of light from end to
end; throngs press to its doors to hall
the Prince, and when their torches fall
them are replaced by others no less
delirious. Bands blare in every public
place. The confines of the city are tou
narrow for this pageant of a nation's
madness. T see the beacons on the dis
tant hills like crimson stars upon a far
horizon, and they link up a mighty
gfrdle embracing height and chasm,
lighting the silvered Ice-fields or show
ing the heart of sleeping woods. From
gorge to gorge and pass to pass the
tidings go, 'Long live the Prince!*
They join in name to his, and utter it
Â¦a* one endeared to them â yes, the little
English girl has won all hearts. I sa
lute her; she is worthy of the tribute!"
a woman, and her womanhood led her
through the valley of the shadows.
Europe has listened to her story and
judged her character wisely. The af
termath is her own, to be reaped by
her affections.
; THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALL\
A lambent flame twining about a log
Â¦which the scuffle had dislodged, pene
trated the shadows with a generous
beam of light and revealed the hidden
shapes and all the evidences of strife.
It showed Esther that to which her
eyes had been blinded in the moment
of the deed. For to her tragedy had
been swift and paralyzing, robbing her
of her common faculties and stilling
her tongue. She had seen a face in the
golden aureole, had heard an echo of
mad laughter; and then the dead man
lay at her feet and the lantern went
out and the darkness of the supreme
mystery enveloped her.
She fled from the room and ran wild
ly down the stairs. If the unknown
had passed out, what should forbid
her? An Iron-clamped door at the
stairs foot mocked her confidence, and
though she beat upon it with clenched
hands and found her voice and cried
hysterically for help, none answered
her. The vain blows echoed vainly in
the empty vault above. She sank upon
a step, crouching as though afraid of
that which must came after. Who
watched In the darkness? she asked.
Who had let the woman out? What
friend had been her confederate?
Night passed and found her still hid
ing from the truth. She had lost the
power to reason or to associate her
own fortunes with this supreme trag
edy. Distant bells chimed the watch
ing hours, but none called to her pris
on.
It was bitterly cold upon the stair-

OF that really remarkable compila
tion of the historical and arch
aeological lore of Israel, the Jew-
ish Encyclopedia, the seventh
volume Is now Issuedâ a book as rich
in fact and scholarly effort as those
that have preceded. This volume, em
bracing In its range from "Italy" to
"Leon," nearly 1800 topics. Is especially
valuable for Its expositions of Old Tes
tament and Talmudlcal literature, in
that its alphabetical allotment em
braces such names as Job, Jephthah
and Judah I, patriarch and redactor of
the Mishnah.
The average gentile, and for that
matter the average Jew, will be sur
prised to learn from the reading of the
present volume of the encyclopedia of
the vast store of Jewish literature that
has been laid up since the last book
of the Talmud was written. We find
that 30,000 does not cover the total
number of Hebrew books written from
the time of the final fall of Jerusalem
before the Roman arms to the present
day. Before the twelfth volume of the
encyclopedia â¢ appears the editors so
we are assured, will have given their
attention to at least two-thirds of these
publications, written In all ages and a
dozen different tongues. -In the seventh
volume the works of the two early
Hebrew singers, Judah-ha-Levl and
Eleazar Kalir, receive attention,
the article on Kallr being of especial
interest owing to the haze of mytho
logical tradition surrounding the head
of the liturgical psalmist.
The Biblical characters that are given
attention in the present volume offer
the opportunity for the Introduction of
ancient Hebraic folklore relative to the
lives of the several worthies. In Hag
gadic literature It seems that many of
the stories of the Old Testament were
gOT one of the least interesting
Â» I phenomena of present day llter
j\J ary activities is that of the fran

sational on the part of our writer folk
and the corresponding avidity with
which the results of their ingenuity
are sought after by the dear public.
Despite Emerson's preachment, it Is
not to the door of the man who can
build a better mouse trap than his
neighbor that the literary world makes
a " beaten path, but to the threshold
of him who can fashion a stranger. By
that token is the door mat before the
sanctum of G. Sidney Paternoster des
tined soon to be worn to a frazzle. "The
Motor Pirate" is certainly the medal
mouse trap of the summer's book sea
son from the point of view of the seek
er for sensation in fiction.
Here we have the story of a strictly
up-to-date Dick Turpln who straddles,
not a good black mare, but the guiding
wheel of the fastest motor car In the
world. By night he sallies forth from
the fastness of his garage and scours
the roads over the whole of lower Eng
land, levying toll upon every belated
motorist whom chance may throw in
Ijls path, cutting up didos with terri
fied mail carriers and even holding up
his august ..Majesty Edward himself.
One hundred miles an hour Is nothing
to this motor pirate. Space and time
reel out behind the wheels of his rak
ish craft like thread off a yarn skein.
He is a devil. But after indulging him
self for the length of full 240 pages this
fiend on wheels is hoist by his own
petard. After kidnaping .the fair young
thing who plays the heroine in the
story and being chased by the aven
gers in one of his own miraculous con
traptions, the motor pirate very fitting
ly choses to select Lands End as the
place for his extinction and his exit
from the story is accompanied by a
loud splash and a smother of foam.

â¢ so distorted by the interpretation or tne
ancient rabbis as to bear little resem
blance to the original. The story of
Jonah, according to this popularized
version, is as rich in Imaginative quall
.ties as any of the "Thousand and One
Nights."
When Jonah went to Joppa he found
no shlD, for the vessel on which he in
tended taking. passage had sailed two
days before his arrival; but God caused
a contrary wind to arise and the ship
was driven back to port. In his Joy
Jonah paid his passage money in ad
vance, contrary to the usual custom,
which did not require payment until
the conclusion of the voyage. Accord
ing to some he paid even the full value,
of the ship, amounting to 4000 gold de
narii. When the storm arose the kind
hearted Bailors, evidently respecting the
rich passenger, first lowered Jonah only
far enough for the waters to reach
his knees. Seeing that the storm sub
sided, they drew him back into the
ship, whereupon the sea at Â©nee arose
again. The sailors repeated the opera
tion several times with the same result,
each time lowering him deeper and
deeper, until finally they threw him
into the sea.
The fish which swallowed Jonah was
created in the very beginning of the
Â¦world for that special purpose. There
fore this fish had so large a mouth
and throat that Jonah found it as
easy to pass into its belly as he would
have found it to enter the portals of
a very large synagogue. It had eyes
which were as large as windows and
lamps lit up Its interior. According to
another opinion a great pearl suspend
ed In the entrails of the fish enabled
Jonah to see all that was in the sea
and in the abyss. The fish informed
Jonah that he waa to be devoured by
Leviathan. Jonah asked to be taken
to the monster, when he would save
both his own life and that of the fish.
Meeting Leviathan he exhibited the
"seal of Abraham," whereupon the
monster shot away a distance of two
days. To reward him for this service
the fish showed Jonah all the wondrous
things in the ocean (e. g., the path 'of
the Israelites across the Red Sea; the
pillars upon which the earth rests).
Thus he spent three days and three
nights in the belly of the fish.
In the department of history the pres

John Casimir, King of Poland, the

country's early history, giving us some
quaint provisions adopted by the Jews
for certifying the legitimacy of their
marriages after their release from the

Huldah drawing up the sheet over all

puts us directly in touch with the lit

Through her own mouth we learn that
Huldah is the self-appointed mother
of all the motherless. Then through a
series of simple little incidents the life

the lives about her are brought out.
Of course there is a light love thread

THE study of sex relations and dif
ferences, only seriously undertaken
by the scientists within very recent
years, has been productive of re
sults as pertinent to the science of so
ciology as to existing theories of psy
chology and anthropology. Not only
do problems of Industrialism hang upon
a rational review of the relation of sex
to sex, but the whole agitation for an
elevation of the sphere of woman and a
recognition of her equality with man
on an intellectual, even a physical
plane, awaits for its Justification the
authoritative deductions of specialists
in this realm of scientific endeavor. Au
thorities unite In agreeing that Have
lock Ellis In his "Man and Woman,"
published ten years ago, succeeded in
drawing all the lines of thought in this
field to the most complete and logical
conclusion yet determined upon. His
book, now revised and made to Incor
porate the results of recent experiment,
again comes to the hands of thinking
men and women.
The chief aim of Ellis' book is to fix
upon the extent to which sexual differ
ences are artificial, the result of tradi
tion and environment, and how far are
they due to actual physical differences
between man and woman. To pave the
way for an analysis of the question tha
author has first to consider the general
physical characteristics of the sexes,
their similarities and differences, bring
ing to bear the evidence of anthropol
ogy and the tenets of evolution. This
done, he has yet the field of natural
and morbid psychology to deal with,
with emphasis upon special questions
of hypnotic phenomena, emotional af
fectability and the variatlonal tendency.
Throughout the entire course of his ex
position the author Is careful always
to distinguish between those manifesta
tions of mind and activities of body
that are the result of purely functional
processes and those undoubtedly In
duced by acquired customs of thought
and action.
Civilization acts to eradicate artificial
sexual differences, according to Ellis.
The advance of society has witnessed
a mingling of the domains of man and
woman, In the primitive stage so
rigidly prescribed. But, physically, a
woman Is a woman and a man a man;
as a consequence a masculine and a
feminine mentality must ever be un
like, stripped though they might be of
the artificial traditions of custom. Be
cause woman has the weaker body, be
cause she is less able to defend her
self, ruse and deceit are naturally
attributes of her mental life. Because
from physical reasons woman's life Is
always along the path of a rhythmic
curve of physical and psychic variation,
she is variable, always In a change.
Man, on the other hand, from the very
nature of his unvarying existence, lacks
the nlmbleness of intellect, the nervous
activity of resource which we call tact,
that is woman's.
Thus does the author carry his In
vestigations down to the fundamental
phenomena of our psychic life. Broadly,
he concludes that in the scheme of life
man has shown a greater tendency to
a change of type than woman, woman
being more prone to remain closer to
the. physical and psychic type of child
hood. The alleged inferiority of woman
to man cannot admit of proof, for the
law of compensation operates to keep
the balance neutral. "The hope of our
future civilization lies in the develop
ment In equal freedom of both the mas
culine and feminine elements in life."

Presidential manager. Even though
each figure was represented with a

author assures us that a few of the

tion of political plums, very much as
tome of our wardsters when they fore
gather in the back room of a saloon to
day. Nor were the methods of the early
caucus greatly at variance with those
in vogue to-day. After the constitution
was enforced and it became necessary
to elect national and State officers, we
read that In Congressional caucuses
Presidential nominations were decided
upon, and in like Star Chamber sessions
cf State Legislatures the destinies of
gubernatorial aspirants were weighed
In the balance of political expediency.
As the author need hardly state, this
method of political procedure, tolerated
In the new and widely proclaimed land
of democratic freedom, was somewhat
of an anomaly.
It was in 1S24 that the clamor for a
more representative nominating body
made the caucus holders give way, and
a New York State nominating conven
tion, consisting of as many* delegates
as there were members In the Assem
bly, met to nominate candidates for
Governor and Lieutenant Governor.
Then came the national Republican
party, with the national convention
Idea. At the first national convention
thus ordered under Its dictates In Bal
timore, December, 1831, Henry Clay re
ceived the unanimous vote of the dele
gates for Presidential nominee. "Old

the nomination of Van Buren as his

purpose, and by his characteristic
adroitness saddled the same with tha
famous "two-thirds rule"â the lasting
heritage cf Jacksonlan Democracy for
all succeeding voters of that sterling
political stripe.
The three tragedies of national con
ventions, centering about the heads of
'Webster, of Clay and later of Blalne,

the coerce of political events, which in
each Instance brought to these luckless
aspirants to Presidential honors crush
ing disappointment. In the cases of the
two old-school politicians, less familiar
to ns of the new century. Clay's com
plaint seemed to have covered the
cacse for the failure of both when he
exclaimed. "I am the most unfortunate
man la the history of partiesâ always
run by my friends when sure to bo de
feated, and now betrayed for a nom
ination when I, or any one, would be
sure of an election."
Of peculiar Interest Is the author's
description of the proceedings at the
Chicago convention of 1860, wherein the
new Republican party first tested Its
strength and Lincoln was nominated
to run for the Presidential chair, al
ready tottering; before the storm of se
cesElon. Here it was that that peculiar
feature of modern conventions, organ
ized uproar, first found Its power and
became a fixed adjunct to all subse

told that while the Jubilant supporters
of Seward were busy parading through
the streets the display of their strength
the Lincoln "sbouters" thronged into
the convention hall and occupied eo
much space that when their opponents

Joseph B. Bishop's book, "Our Political

liness to enhance its intrinsic worth.
Th<* book, according to the author's
foreword, "does not pretend to either
ho comprehensiveness or the full dig
nity of history. It is merely the per
and dramatic side of certain
events in our political history." As
fuch. then, the volume is well calcu
lated to Â£ive us entertaining in-.ights
upon some of the byways of our politi
cal record which r scare the eye of the
Â« nfessed writer of history.
The major portion of the book, end by
far the most interesting, is that dealing
with the Inception of the national con

life and outlining some of the intensely
dramatic incidents attendant upon the
deliberations of such bodies in the past.
For even truer to-day than was it fifty

the authorization of the constitution,
yet as fully rooted in national practice
as If sanctioned by that instrument,
lies the real formative power, the ini

reading of Bishop's book we see how
gradually this extra-ccnstitutional
measure came to have almost the bind

LAST OF THE MID-SUMMER BOOKS
5sat at a table to play, so I, too, sat down arm was asked by the man in
charge, called Â«the dealer, how many chips I wanted. My friend kindly
answered for me, and, I was soon playing with lively interest. I won a
considerable sum, and thought of quitting, for all who win thereby crip
ple the power of Satan; but I concluded to play on and perhaps take all
of the ill-got gains away from the den of iniquity.
Again I won, but soon lost, and although I played with cool calcu
lation, to my distress I did not win again.' Again and again the dealer
gave me what chips I needed, never asking me for money, until I sud
denly realized that I was indebted to the game several hundreds â some
thousands, I confess, uncle â and I was distressed to an extreme degree.
I had no such sum with me, and in my confusion did not remember
that I could draw a check until Mr. Faykerr thoughtfully reminded me,
whispering, "If you want to quit you will find a desk with checks on it
in the other room."
I was somewhat relieved to have the proprietor accept my check
without question and with a polite invitation to call again and a wish for
my better luck next time. I shall certainly call again; not that I ap
prove of gambling, but to a person of my stern and persistent morality it
would be compromising with the devil to allow my money to remain in
the hands of such instruments of evil. I. shall not only regain what I
lost, but win much more, as a lesson and rebuke to the man who so
plausibly conducts the evil resort. This I can do by skillfully adopting the
plan- of betting next time on the .very cards I lost on last time.
We spent some further hours of the night in studies of the lighter
sides of metropolitan life, and, to my surprise, Mr. Faykerr was plenti
fully supplied with money, which he spent liberally â though he over
looked repaying me the cost of the dinner.
In the course of the evening, at'a restaurant where all the distin
guished artists of the dramatic and operatic stage gather for supper, I was
made acquainted with Miss Mayme Franklyn, fancifully nicknamed by
her intimates "Babe." She confided to me that she is soon to star in a
DEAR UNCLE SILAS: I thank you for advising me not to go
abroad lo forget my grief, but to remain here in New York and
make a friend of Mrs. Lacquerre, as she asked me to. I might
not have accepted the advice had not the lady sent me a kind
invitation to lunch with her and discuss my plans. In the
course of the agreeable talk I had with her I was surprised to
learn that j-ou and she arc old acquaintances, and that you see much of
her during: your visits to New York.
She admires you. and if 1 am not mistaken â which is scarcely possible
â she entertains? a sentimental regard lor you, which I am now able to
say. with no heart hurt, that I hope you reciprocate. She made no refer
ence to my proposal of marriage, but spoka of the things a young man a
stranger in New York should do and not do. Of course, such
advice, was well meant, but it was unnecessary for one who, like me, is
controlled in all things by caution and a;i instinctive knowledge of the
world.
During ray call I met Mrs. Ltcquerre's daughter, Frances, and ob
served her with interest, because of Mrs. Lacquerre's remark at a pre
\ious interview that her daughter was old enough to be my wife. This
may be true, but if she is old enough that certainly is her only qualifica
tion, for a less attractive joung person I never met. She is a recent
graduate of a fashionable academy patronized by the rich and exclusive
families, but what is taught there can be of no use or interest to any one.
I examined Miss Frances at length on topics of vital interest, but
found her lamentably ignorant on the first principles of political economy,
the tendencies of imperialism and its clangers, and she was disposed to
smile in a superior manner when I asked her views on these and kin
dred subjects, which, to my horror, she characterized as "fudge."
She is a tall girl, slender, dark, atid looks with grave eyes in silence
on things about her. I am told that graduates of her academy are noted
for a manner of aristocratic reserve which is much commended, but to me
it seems a manner of mild insolence, an assumption of superiority for
which their mental accomplishments give them no warrant.
How unlike to Frances is another young lady I have met! She is not
tall and is light in coloring; she has no manner of foolish superiority, and
instead of a real or assumed amusement at my acute understanding of
weiglity matters, she lakes the keenest interest in listening to me. She
begs for instruction, and is rapidly advancing in an understanding of mat
ters political and industrial. The story of our meeting is one which I
must relate in my usually orderly style of composition.
Some days ago I was surprised by receiving a call from Mr. Bob Fay
kerr. You may recall that for one term there came to our 'academy at
home a young gentleman of the name of Faykerr, who was allowed to
resign because of an impetuosity in his manner of living which did not
comport with the traditions of the academy. This is the same gentleman.
I did not have the pleasure of his acquaintance then, and now I recall
that, he impressed me as not being sympathetic; as looking with amuse
ment on my scholarly ambitions and moral conduct. But I find that in
this I was mistaken, for he assures me that he admired me greatly at the
academj' and wished to profit by my acquaintance, but was kept from do
ing so by a consciousness that he was unfit to claim equality with a pupil
of my exalted moral and intellectual gifts. This was so natural that I
admitted at once, when he so explained, that I had been unjust in my
mistrust and dislike of him.
He politely invited me to dine with him and a party of friends that
very evening and, further proposed to show me the city in certain aspects
which I had overlooked. As I was still sad over a matter which I shall
not again mention, I gladly took advantage 'of the opportunity to join
his gay company.
After dinner Mr. Faykerr remarked that as I was a student of sociology
and civic reform it might be well for me to study at first hand some of
the phases of life which have come under the condemnation of Mr. Je
rome, who, I find, is the District Attorney here, as well as the Public Cen
sor of Morals. I agreed with the suggestion of my thoughtful friend, but
was surprised to learn that any of the gambling places were open for in
spection, having heard that all were closed by the vigorous methods of
suppression employed by Mr. Jerome.
Mr. Faykerr assured me that there were a few left for the accommo
dation of gentlemen of an investigating turn of mind, and soon proved
that he was right by taking me to a place of the kind.
We began our studies by meeting the proprietor of the establishment,
who was so able to conceal his hideous character that he appeared like
a quiet and scholarly gentleman, and was able also to assume an amiable
and courteous attitude toward me. To my surprise he did not at once
suggest that I gamble, Tjut instead directed my attention to some very
creditable objects of art by well-known artists and curios of exceeding
beauty. Then he hospitably invited us to enter the supper room and
partake free of a repast there set forth and served in excellent style.
After a bird and a glass of champagne which a colored servitor of
fered, my friend suggested that v^e see the actual gambling. We ascend
ed a rich stairway of marble and bronze to a floor above, where a num
ber of patrons were engaged in playing a game called faro. Although it
was not my purpose to carry my studies to the extreme point "of partici
pating in. the wicked hazard of chance, I decided to do so to be better
equipped to denounce the evil in a book I purpose writing about this sin
ful city.
Mr. Faykerr, doubtless with some such high moral purpose, already
splendid production of a famous playwright's masterpiece, but at present Is
resting from professional employment.
She is, as I have said â for of course she is the lady I have contrasted
with Miss Lacquerre â petite, blond, merry, but highly intellectual. In
short, dear uncle, she is the most ravishingly beautiful creature I ever
saw. In spite of her sedate mental tendencies she allows herself sim
ple recreations as a relief from the arduous duties of her professional
work, and was. at the time I first met her, drinking champagne from, a
stein and eating lobster.
She was richly attired, though rather less completely than seemed
becoming to so distinguished an artist in so public a place â her waist
consisting of little more than a belt and two shoulder straps â but she ex
plained this by informing me that she had just come from a reception at
the Van Aster's. To my delight she agreed to go with me to the next
day's races in an automobile Mr. Faykerr had engaged for me.
We had a merry party. Several other famous actresses with whose
names I was not familiar, as they had been playing abroad in London and
Paris, they informed me, accompanied us, and a lunch Mr. Faykerr
thoughtfully ordered for me from a noted caterer we ate en route, going
and coming, the young ladies playfully throwing bottles at other auto
mobile parties containing friends, and otherwise proving that their severe
artistic training does not suppress their liveliness of heart.
For several days Psaw much of Babe â Miss Franklyn â and found her
a woman worthy of my real adoration. All my aspirations interested her,
all my plans she approved, all my views she understood. Finding my at
tachment to her of such a nature that she is constantly in my thoughts, I
have about concluded to offer her my heart and hand.
I was interrupted at this point by receiving a note from Mrs. Lac
querre asking me to call at once. I responded, and she questioned me
about the distinguished friends I have recently made, concerning whom,
in relation to me, she said there was some current gossip. When I had
finished naming and describing them Mrs. Lacquerre declared: "Reuben,
you have fallen into the clutches of as lively a gang of sharpers and
bounders as New York can boast.
"Your friend Faykcrr really comes of a good family, but he was dis
owned by them years ago. He has several times been the hero of sen
sational press stories of scrapes which would have landed him in jail if
swindled men â like you â would prosecute him. Of course they won't, and
he impudently continues living by the industry of plucking geese. The
others you mention are not actresses, but belong to the army of name
less parasites who find nourishment after their kind. For your sake, and
because of my regard for your uncle, I warn you to beware of such
cattle."
Upon returning to my hotel I found a message from Miss Franklyn
asking if it would be convenient to loan her for a few days the sum of
five hundred dollars. She is to repay it from her first week's salary as a
star, yet is so distressed at the necessity of asking the temporary favor
that she is nearly ill from nervousness, so is obliged to request me to
send the sum named. But I shall give her a pleasant surprise by taking
the loan to her in person, so will delay the conclusion of this letter until
my return.
Dear Uncle Silas: I fear there is more guilt in this world than I was
prepared to encounter, and that I must revise my judgment of some of
my friends. I found Miss Franklyn, on whom I have just called, in a
morning gown â it was six in the afternoonâ of tenuous texture and some
what untidy appearance. She seemed more surprised than pleased to have
me respond in person, and excused her appearance by informing me that
because of long rehearsals without salary she had been obliged to pawn
much of her extensive wardrobe.
I asked her at once to accept the loan she had requested, and she re
ceived it with assurances of a speedy return. She then said that she was
so much overcome by my kindness that it would be painful for her to
prolong the interview, so, regretting that I had no opportunity to maka
the proposal! had in mind, I departed. At the front door of the apart
ment house in which she occupies somewhat restricted accommodations
I saw that it was raining, and to my annoyance I found that I had left
my umbrella in Miss Franklyn's hall. ,
I returned quietly, and finding the door ajar, as I had left it, entered,
thinking not again to disturb the lady in her nervous condition. To my
great confusion I heard her in an adjoining room talking in a joyful
manner to another person, who, I judged from their manner, ovas her
mother. I refrain from relating to you the conversation I could not but
overhear before I secured my umbrella and fled, but I am compelled by
a sense of duty to admit to you, dear uncle, that I heard her mother af
fectionately reproach Babe for not having asked me for a thousand dol
lars, remarking, "He is so easy a mark."
The young lady's gleeful response was that she knew a good thing
when she had it, and did not purpose to kill the goose which promised
to lay so many golden eggs.
Horror struck at hearing this and a little more it is unnecessary to
repeat, I found my umbrella and rushed from the room. While I am
compelled to admit that Misi Franklyn's conduct is not free from suspi
cion, I still feel that if her interest in sugar of the beet variety were prop
erly cultivated it would turn her thoughts from lobster and wine toward
a life of greater sweetness and light. Neither can I forget that in speak
ing of me to her mother she applied to me a term of endearment. She
has frequently said to me that she dearly loves a lobster, and I over
heard her say to her mother, in speaking of me, "He's such a lobster!"
Affectionately, REUBEN.
THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALU.
REUBEN FROM BEETVILLE
6Every summer I suffer much from indignation'. I love to
watch the swallows building. They build beneath the eaves out
side my study window. Such cheerful little chatterboxes they
arc ! Long after sunset, when all the other birds are sleeping,
the swallows still are chattering softly. It sounds as if they
were telling one another some pretty story, and often I am sure
there must be humor in it, for every now and then one hears a
little twittering laugh. I delight in having them there, so close to
me. The fancy comes to me that one day when my brain has
grown more cunning, I, too, listening in the twilight, shall hear
the stories that they tell.
One or two phrases already I have come to understand:
"Once upon a time" â "long, long ago"â "in a strange, far-off
land." I hear these words so constantly I am sure I have them
right. I call it "Swallow street," this row of six or seven
nests. Two or three, like villas in their own grounds, stand
alone, ami others are semi-detached. It makes me angry that the
sparrows will come and steal them. The sparrows will, hang
about deliberately waiting for a pair of swallows to finish their
nest, then, with a brutal laugh that makes my blood boil, drive
the swallows away and take possession of -it. And the swallows
arc so wonderfully patient. "Never mind, old girl," says Johnny
Swallow, after the first big cry is over, to Je*nny Swallow, "let's
try again." And half an hour later, full of fresh plans, they are
choosing another likely site, chattering cheerfully once more. I
watched the building of a particular nest for nearly a fortnight
one j'ear; and when, after two or three days' absence I returned
and found a pair of sparrows comfortably ensconsed therein, I
just felt mad. I saw Mrs. Sparrow looking out Maybe my an
ger was working upon my imagination, but it seemed to me that
she nodded to me. "Nice little house, ain't it. What I call well
built."
Mr. Sparrow then flew up with a gaudy, feather dyed blue,
which belonged to me. I recognized it. It had come out of the
brush with which the girl breaks the china ornaments in our
drawing-room. At an;- other time I should have been glad to
see him flying off with the whole thing, handle included. But
now I felt the theft of one feather as an added injury. 'Mrs. Spar
row chirped with delight at the sight of the gaudy monstrosity.
Having got the house cheap they were going to spend their small
amount of energy upon internal decoration. That was their idea
clearly, a "Liberty interior." She looked more like a Cockney
sparrow than a country one â had been born and bred in Regent
street, no doubt. .Â«-. . .' /,.
"There is not much justice in this world/' said' I to myself,
"but there's going to be some introduced into this businessâ that
is, if I can find a ladder." I did find a ladder, and fortunately it
was long enough. Mr. and Mrs,. Sparrow were out when I arrived ;
possibly on the hunt for cheap photo frames and Japanese fans. I
did not want to make a mess "; I removed the house neatly into a
dust pan and wiped the street clear of every: trace of it. ,' I had'
just put back the ladder when Mrs. Sparrow returned with a piece
of pink cotton wool in her mouth. That was her idea of a color
scheme ; apple-blossom pink and Reckitt's. blue side by side. She
dropped her wool and sat on the water spou't arid tried to under
stand "Number I, number 2, number 4, where the blaze"
Copyrright, 1904, by Central NewÂ« and PresÂ« Exchane*.
â sparrows are essentially common and the women are as bad as
the men â "is number 3?" Mr. Sparrow came up from behind,
over the roof. He was carrying a piece of yellow fluff, part of a
lamp shade, as far as I could judge. "Move yourself," he said,
"what's the sense of sitting there in the rain." "I went out just
for a moment," replied Mrs. Sparrow; "I could not have been
gone, no, not a couple of minutes.
"When I came back" "Oh, get indoors," said Mr. Spar
row, "talk about it there." "It's what I'm telling you," continued
Mrs. Sparrow, "if you would only listen. There isn't any door,
there isn't any house" "Isn't any"- Mr. Sparrow, holding
on to the rim of the spout, turned himself topsy-turvey and sur
veyed the street. From where I was standing, behind the laurel
bushes, I could see nothing but his. back. He stood up again look
ing angry and flushed. "What have you done with the house?
Can't I turn my back" "I ain't done nothing with it. As I
keep on telling you, I had only just gone" "Oh, bother where
you had gone. Where's the darned house gone? That's what I
want to know." They looked at one another. If ever astonish
ment was expressed in the attitude of a bird, it was told -by the
tails of those two sparrows. They whispered wickedly together.
The idea occurred to them that by force or cunning they might
perhaps obtain possession of one of the other nests.
But all the other nests were occupied, and even gentle Jenny
Swallow, in her own home with the children round about her, i3
not to be trifled with. Mr. Sparrow called at Number 2, put his
head in at the door, then returned to the water spout. "Lady says
we don't live there,'.' he explained to Mrs. Sparrow. There was
silence for a while. "Not what I call a classy street," commented
Mrs. Sparrow. "If it were not for this terrible tired feeling of
mine," said Mr. Sparrow, "blame me if I wouldn't build a house
of my own." "Perhaps," said Mrs/ Sparrow, "I have heard it said
that a little bit of work, now and then, does you good." "All sorts
of wild ideas about in the air nowadays," said Mr. Sparrow;
"it don't do to .listen to everybody." "And it don't do to sit still
and do nothing, neither," snapped Mrs. Sp'arrow. "I don't want
to forget I'm. a lady, butâ well, any man who was a man could see
things for himself." "Why did I ever marry?" retorted Mr. Spar
row. They flew away together, quarrelling. ?
balmy â when, after carrying up to her a load or two of bricks
and a hod or two of mortar, we could knock off work for a few
minutes without fear of the whole house being swept away into the
next street â could sit side by side on the top of the wall, our legs
dangling down, and peck a morsel together; after which I could
whistle a bit to her â then housebuilding might be a pleasure.
With the unerring instinct of a born critic she had divined my
one weak point. Other objections raised against nto I could have
met. But that one stinging reproach was unanswerable. It has
made me, as I explained, chary of tendering advice on matters out
side my own department of life. Otherwise, at this period of the
year, there is much that I should like to say to nty good friends â the
"birds. I want to put it to them s:rioi:sly. Is not the month of
February just a little too early? Of course their answer will be
the same as in case of my motherly friend, "Oh, what do you
know about it? You are not a bird." I know I am not a bird, but
that is the very reason why they should listen to me. I bring a
fresh mind to bear on, the subject. I am not tied down by bird
convention. February, my dear friends â in these northern climes
of ours, at all events â is much too early. You have to build in a
high wind, and nothing, believe me, tries a lady's temper more
than being: blown about. Nature is nature, and womenfolk, my
dear sirs, are the same all the world over, whether they be bird or
whether they be human. I am an older person that most of you,
and I speak with' the weight of experience.
If I were going to build a house with my wife I should not
choose a season of the year when the bricks and planks and things
were liable to be torn out of her hand, her skirts %>lown over her
head, and she left clinging for dear life to a scaffolding pole. I
know the feminine biped, and you take it from me that it is not her
notion of a honeymoon. In April or May; the sun shining, tlie
"What do you know about Rabies?'- she demanded. "If you
will read the paper," I replied, "von will see for .yourself. It's all
there." She flicked over the pages contemptuously. "There
doesn't seem much of it," she retorted. "It is condensed," I
pointed out to her. "I am glad it is short. All right, I'll read it,"
she agreed. 1 thought my presence mi^iit disturb her, so went
out into the garden. I wanted her to get the full benefit of it. I
crept back now and again to peep through the open window. She
did not seem to be making many notes. But I heard her making
little noises to herself. When I saw she had reached the last page I
re-entered the room. "Well?" I said. "Is it meant to be funny?" she
demanded, "or is it intended to be taken seriously?" "There rnay
be flashes of humor here and there â " She did not wait to'- let
me finish. "Because, if it's meant to be funny," she said, "I dont
think it is at all funny. And if is intended to be serious, there's
one thing very clear, and that is thai, you are not a mother!"^
1AM chary nowadays of offering counsel In connection witfi
subjects concerning which I am not and cannot be an author
ity, liong ago I once took upon myself to write a paper about
Â¦*Â¦ babies. It did not aim to be a textbook upon the subject.
It did not even claim to exhaust the topic. I was willing that
others, coming after me, should continue the argument â that is,
if upon reflection they were still of opinion there was anything
more to be said. I was pleased with the article., I went out of my
way to obtain an early copy and the*magazine in which it ap
peared, 0:1 purpose to show it to a lady friend of-mine. She was
the possessor of one or two babies of her own â specimens in no
way remarkable, though she herself, as was natural enough, did
her best to boom them. I thought it might be helpful to her â
Â¦\i? vi.nvs r.nd observations, not of a rival fancier, who would be
. juiced, but of an intelligent amateur. I put the magazine into
: . r.r.r.d^, opened at the proper place. "Read it through care
:..., iÂ»Â«d quietly," I said; "don't let anything distract you. Have
a pencil and a bit of paptr ready at your side and note down any
points upon which you would like further information. If there
is anything you think I have missed out let me know. It may be
thru hero and there you will be disagreeing with me; if so, do not
hesitate to mention "it : I shall hot be angry. If a demand arise I
shall very likely issue an enlarged and improved edition of this
paper in the form of a pamphlet ; in which case, hints and sug
gestions that to you may appear almost impertinent will be of dis
tinct hcli) to me."
"I iun'cn't got a pencil." slid said. "What's it all about?"
"It's about babies,"' I explained.
1 lent her a pencil. (That is another thing I've learnt. Never
lend a pencil to a woman if you ever want to see it back again.
She has three answers to your request for its return. The first,
that she gave it back to you, and that you put it in your pocket,
and that it's ihere.now ; that if it isn't it ought to be. The sec
ond, that you never lent it to her. The third, that she wishes
people would not lend her pencils and then clamor for them back
again, just when she has something else far more important to
think about.)
BABIES AND BIRDS
THE SAN FRANGISCO SUNDAY CAIX.
7no_textno_textWHEN the Japanese appear
at the dawn of history this
energetic people were ab
eorbing Chinese- culture and
civilization Just as eagerly as they are
bow absorbing the still higher culture
of the West.
As early as the third century after
Christ, Chinese travelers were bringing
to the Japanese the wisdom of their
ancient civilization, and by the begin
ning of the ninth century the institu
tions of China had almost entirely su
perseded the crude political and legal
Institutions of Japan. The elaborate
codes known as Rltsu, Rel, Kaku,
Ehlki were mere reproductions of Chi
nese laws of the Tong dynasty.
Chinese Jurisprudence, however, was
Ill-adapted to the exigencies of a
feudal government, with its seml
anarchlc conditions. The growinr power
of the military chiefs weakened more
and more the authority of the central
government, and by the middle of the
sixteenth century the anarchy was
complete. An organized system of law
bad now become Impossible. Each
feudal baron was a law unto himself.
In Japan, as In feudal Europe, every
lord or master dispensed justice In his
own affairs, territories, house or fam
ily. Like the ancient paterfamilias,
the Japanese lords had their domestic
tribunals, over which the head of the
family presided as judge and. If need
be, as executioner. But, unlike the
Roman father, the Japanese parent
had not the power of life and death
over his own children, though there
were certain offenses for which he
might summarily kill his wife or
daughters.
A husband who found his wife with
Brother man In any apartment of
"In respect to revenging Injury done
to master or father, it Is granted by
the wise and virtuous (Confucius) that
you and the injurer cannot live to
gether under the canopy of heaven.
A person harboring such vengeance
shall notify the Criminal Court; and
though no check or hindrance may be
offered to his carrying out his desire
within the period allowed for that pur
pose, it Is forbidden that the chastise
ment of an enemy be attended with
riot. Fellows who neglect to give no
tice of their Intended revenge are like
wolves of pretext; and their punish
ment or pardon shall depend upon the
circumstances of the case."
5 Upon giving notice to the Hlo Jo sho
(Criminal Court), the person seeking
revenge was required to state In how
many days or months he could carry
out his intention. The period assigned
was thereupon entered In the book of
the office, and thus the enemy's assas
sination was legalized. The killing of
an enemy without previous notice of
such Intention having been given to the
proper authorities were regarded as
murder, and so punished.
The severe criminal laws of the Tok
ugawa Government were not abolished
when the rule of that famous dynasty
âwhich had held sway in Tokio from
1603 to 1S58â terminated. Most of the
ancient laws of Iyeyas still remained
in force, though the Government was
easer to adopt a European Judicial
system as soon as. practicable.
In 1870 the judicial department, as a
separate board, was established, under
the progressive, not to say aggressive.
Yeto Shinpei, who was how appointed
Minister of Justice.
Yeto Shinpei, who was always ready
to attempt reforms on a grand scale,

The results of this vast reform in the

they are competent to suppress.
ished, together with the execrable
practice of torture. "
A little later on M. Bolssonade, pro
fessor in the University of Paris., was
employed as legal adviser, and was
commissioned to draft new civil and
criminal code3. -
In 137S the new Criminal Code and
the Code of Criminal Procedure were
promulgated, but they were not act
ually In force until 1831. These codes
were framed after the French codes.
Decapitation was abolished by the new
code, and hanging remained the sole
method of inflicting the death penalty.
Instead of the 250 crimes calling lov
the death penalty under the old sys
tem, capital punishment is now threat
ened only for treason, arson, murder
and rape. Of these four arson is only
capitally punishable in cases of a very
grave nature, accompanied with Ios3 of
life. Penal servitude. Imprisonment
with or without hard labor, fines and
certain police supervision are the only
other punishments inflicted for crimes
less severe than those mentioned
above. Corporal punishment, such as
flogging or whipping. Is no longer per
mitted. Young criminals are sent to
reformatories. Trial by Jury has \ not
been adopted in Japan. Neither is there
any law of the nature of habeas cor
pus, but the Code of Criminal Proced
ure provides that a prisoner must be
brought up for preliminary examina
tion within forty-eight hours from the
time of his apprehension and empow
ers the examining Judge to grant bail,
the prisoner being entitled to complain
to the court if bail is refused.
by the courts without an effeort at sui
cide was deemed unworthy a Japan
ese gentleman. The relatives of an
accused person were always alert to
see that the imprisoned kinsman was
supplied with a suitable weapon for
self-destruction. When this was Im
possible they endeavored %to come to
an understanding with the officer who
"pu\ the question under torture," and
who for an adequate bribe killed his
charge: by a too heavy hand, as If by
accident, thus saving the victim's
family from ruin.
The following were reckoned as
crimes against the state, and were un
der jurisdiction of the Emperor's
magistrates: The breach of any of the
Emperor's ordinances and proclama
tions; misconduct on the part of the
nobles of the empire In the administra
tion of the affairs committed to them
by the Emperor; the embezzlement or
improper appropriation of the revenues
of the empire; the coining of counter
feit seals and money; the forcible car
rying away "of women from the high
lands to the lowlands. Perjury was
also a capital offense when the object
was, to deceive the magistrates In the
exercise of their Judicial authority.
I The usual punishments for_ crimes
against the v state were burning alive;
crucifixion, with the legs In the air and
the head downward; tearing into four
quarters by bulls and, sometimes, being
cast into boiling water* or oil. But
these last two punishments were abol
ished In the sixteenth 'century by
Iyeyas. :>-â¢.'
In feudal Japan, as among all-bar
barian peoples, the Individual's right
to private vengeance was ; clearly rec
ognized, though certain rules were laid
down with the view to mitigating what
was already beginning to be recog
nized as an evil, even In Iyeyas' time.
Says he: ."Â¦ -v ';'-
and the military who et.joyed the
privilege of suicide, the merchants,
citizens and other persons of Inferior
rank being, punished at the hands of
the public executioner. As to the
Princes and upper order of nobility,
these were exempt from capital or
corpjoral punishment, and In capital
cases were banished to guarded Isl
ands about forty leagues from the
coast. There they lived a miserable
life of privation and toil.
After a death sentence was pro
nounced the victim's property was
confiscated. But neither the Em
peror nor the lord of the territory in
which the crime was committed
shared in the property arising from
confiscation. The entire proceeds
were handed over to a public re
ceiver, who kept an accurate account
of the. same. .The money was then
appropriated for the erection of pa-.
godas and bridges, to the keeping in
repairs of the highroads and public
houses of worship, or to other works
of public utility.
A "supected man, 'especially If guil
ty, was expected by his relatives to
forestall sentence of death by taking
his own life,* thus saving his prop
ery for his heirs, as ,was done by
many a Roman \ under the Caesars.
The Japanese practice of "harakirl"
arose In this way, though it Is not
clear why the custom of dlsembowel
ment was established in preference to
some other form of suicide. Many
Japanese cut their own throat after
opening the bowels by a cross- wise
cut. There ,are said to be no less
than fifty different modes of dlsem
bowelnient, and all Japanese aspire to
perform the operation with great
coolness and courage, which never
falls to elicit: the praise and admira
tion of their countrymen. ' '. To allow
sentence of death to be pronounced
The rules of Iyeyas are marred by
a law which, while violating no prin
ciple of Mongolian Jurisprudence, car
ries us back In imagination to tha
exceptional atrocities of the mad Ro
man Caesars. It was decreed that
"The guilt of a vassal murdering his
suzerain is the same as that of an
arch traitor to the Emperor. His im
mediate companions, his relations
anl all. even to hlsjnost distant con
nections, shall be cut oft* and mowed
to atoms, root and fiber. The guilt of
a vassal only lifting his hand against
his master, even though he does, not
assassinate him, is the same." , If the
Â»wife was an accomplice .In the. crime
she too suffered death,' but If she w/as
Innocent of it she was hot condemned
to death, as were the husband's rel
atives, but was merely sold for a
slave." The rule was that women
were to suffer death* only for their
own crimes; but sis|ers, mothers
and daughters were all sold for slaves.
Every male relative was regarded as
his "brother's keeper" so far as crimes
against the state were concerned, and
upon " the condemnation of, one male
member of the family the others were
duly notified of the date ;of his execu
tion and were .expected .to rip open
their own stomachs at the appointed
day and hour, which they never failed
to do. But it was only the nobles

Murder, whether perpetrated sud

result of cold-blooded treachery, was

was attended by no more suspicious
circumstances. The /husband was ex

wife's infidelity. In fact, if the hus
band happened to be away, the father
of the wife, her son, her brother or any
other relation could exercise the same
right and represent the husband. Even
a male servant belonging to the house
could do the same.
Until the middle of the sixteenth:
century thjere was practically no limit
to the cruelty with which the peasants,
civilians and merchants were treated;
they were all alike despised by the mil
itary chiefs and their followers and
dally subjected to the grossest Indigni
ties and tortures. The slightest offense
committed by a member of any of
these classes was punished by death,
even for theft above the value of a
penny. This law was still in force as
late as 1880, and crucifixion was still
the penalty.

to be until the formal abolition of

The serious girl smiles hard. She

this deep-set eyes with dark shadows,
and the result is earnestness, wistful

The long-eyed girl with a restless ew

The smiling habit shows a lack of

women of tremendous resolution and

The lips are pressed firmly together

A WOMAN'S PAGE AND ITS
EMOTIONAL EXPRESSIONSyoung ladles can promise more In half
an hour than they can perform all the
rest of their lives â he would retire Into
the dark recesses of his mind and dig
up a choice collection of doubts and
fears made specially for just such an
occasion. The young lady might be
handsome and sprightly, but would she
be w'lllng to take In washing or do
china palntins: by the day if it should
ever become necessary?, She might be
intellectual and her mind might appear
good for a five-round go with Ituskln
or Herbert Spencer without extra train
ing, but would she be willing to got up
In the middle of the night and climb
to thu top shelf of the closet for the
paregoric, bottle? She might have
money, but what a sad blow it would
be to one who truly loved her if.sfie
should happen to lose itâ or refuse to
part with it easily! These are merely
samples of the way that, this miser
able representative of the human race
exercised his morbid imagination.
While he was sitting up nights paint
ing black pictures of things that prob
ably wouldn't happen and couldn't be
helped If they did,.* a malevolent fe
male person stole up behind him and
married him unawares, so to speak.
At any rate she dragged him off .the
perch before he*had' had time to- fix
up a real good 'worry. After marriage
he discovered that the possibilities .he
had feared were beds of ro'se leaves
compared with the. things that that
woman did to him. But It -was â¢ too
late to worry about'lt, and besides he
had found something elsa, to occupy
get licked and as a result have the
bottom knocked out of our credit. What
woula have appealed to most of us
t:s a dead sure thing looked so full of
holts to this poor worm that he could
see right through it. Finally he sold
all his securities and brought his
money home where he could sit in
front of the safe with a shotgun day
and night. Along about the second
week of this performance the house
took tire and the firemen dragged the
marl: out of the ravaging element with
all the hair singed off his head and
most of his wearing apparel missing.
The final end of this unattractive
individual overtook him after a long,
stern chase, eorraling him in the poor
house after driving him out of all the
old men's homes In the State. But he
had died so many times already in an
ticipation that his eventual demise was
really only a matter of form gone
through with more for the sake of the
feelings of the undertaker and the offi
ciating clergyman than for any other
reason. The last words that he was
heard to Â¦ utter v/ere expressive of a
foar that his halo would not be a last
year's pattern.
The reasons for relating this sad tale
of human woe are many and various
and most of them are unimportant,
but it Is well to note at least the fact
that while we are working ourselves
into premature old age by crossing
bridges before we come to them, we are
likely to break our necks tumbling over
a bank where there Isn't any bridge at
all.

THE only thing that you can al
ways be sure of finding a ready
market for Is trouble, and the
worse it Is the more easily you
can find some one -who is willing:
to borrow it. The market for real
money may be as tight as a sea-going
submarine; it may be that the only
way to raise a loan of $5 on approved
security is by a return to the good
old way, the simple plan, of convinc

grades and degrees of blackness will
be quoted as firm and easy. Another
fact that should be noted in the cur
rent quotations of trouble is that the
more a man has the more he wants to
borrow. Most men are never able to
get enough.
That's the way it was with a certain
brother to the ox and own cousin to
the original scapegoat whose opera

strain on enfeebled optics. This par
ticular relative of the bovine tribe
spent most of hi3 time on the quarter
deck scanning the horizon for dark
clouds of trouble. The days that he
couldn't raise at least one cyclonic dis

His father had been careful to provide
his unworthy offspring with enough of
this world's goods to keep him from

his next meal but all his meals for two

guaranteed, and he was sure of a place
to sleep in and enough clothes to en

swoop, and the monthly dawn ot the
butcher's bill was not calculated to
cause him any great mental perturba

chapter about taking no thought for
the tnorrow â or any other day â and let
it go at that, but not so with the manu

Fables for the Foolislhi
THE TROUBLES THAT NEVER COME
praised for years in nearly every news
paper on this or the other side of the
Atlantic, we fall back dismayed, with
a Fense of the deepest disappointment
and aggravation, and wonder why we
have beÂ«*n no deceived.
Taken in the majority, the women of
Great Britain are supposed to hold the
palm of beauty against all other wom
en of the nations of the world, and if
the word "beauty" be changed to pret
tiness the Fupposition is no doubt cor
rect. It is somewhat unfortunate, how
ever, that either through the advice of
their dressmakers or their own erro
neous conception of form they should
appear to resent the soft outlines and
gracious curves of nature, for either by
the overexcess of their outdoor sports
or the undue compression of corsets
they are gradually doing away with
their originally intende'd shapes and be
coming as flat-chested as Jockeys under
training. No flat-chested woman is
pretty. No woman with large hands,
large feet and the coarse muscular
throat and jaw developed by constant
bicycle riding can be called fascinating.
The bony and resolute lady whose lines
of figure run straight down without a
curve anywhere from head to heel may
possibly be a good athlete, but her
looks are by no means to her advan
tage. Men's hearts are not enthralled
or captured by a something appearing
to be neither man nor woman. And
there are a great many of these some-
things about just now. I am ignorant
as to whether American women go in
for mannish sports as frequently and
ardently as their British sisters, but 1
notice that they have daintier hands
and feet and less pronounced "muscle."
At the same time American women on
an average are not so pretty as British
women on the same average. The
American complexion is unfortunate.
Often radiant and delicate in earliest
youth, it fades with maturity like a
brilliant flower scorched by too hot a.
sun, and once ' departed returns no
more. The clear complexion of British
women is their best feature. The nat-
ural rose and white skin of an English.
Irish or Scottish girl â especially a girl
born and bred in the countrr â is won
derfully fiesh and lovely and lasting,
and often accompanies her right .
through her life to old age; that is. of
course, if she leaves it alone and is sat
isfied to merely keen it clean, without
any "adornment" from the beauty doc
tor. And, though steadily withholding
the divine word "beauty" from the
greater portion of the "beauties" at the
court of Kins Edward VII, it. is un
questionably the fact that the, prettiest
women in all the world are the British.
"Americans are likely to contest this.
Us lack of wit. It Is a good thing to
have a pretty face; but if the face be
only like a wax mask, moveless and
expressionless, it soon ceases to at-
" tract. The loveliest picture would bore
us if we had to stare at it dumbly all
day. And thore is undeniably a stiff
ness, a formality and often a most
rcpellant and unsympathetic coldness
about the British fair sex which re
acts upon the men and women of other
more warm-hearted and impulsive na
tions in a manner highly disadvan
tageous to the ladies or our Fortunate
Isles. For it is not real stiffness, or
re,al formality after allâ nor is it the
snowy chill of a touch-me-not chastity,
by any means â it is merely a. moat
painful and in many cases most ab
surd self-consciousness. British wom
en are always more or less wondering
what theic'sister women are thinking
about them. They tan manage their
men all right: but they put on curious
and unbecoming airs directly other
feminine influences than their own
c<jme into play. They invite the com
ment; of the opposite sex. but they
dread the criticism of their own. The
owkward girl who sits on the edge trt" a
chair with her feet scraping the carpet
and her hands twiddling uneasily In
her lap is awkward simply because she
has, by some means or other, been
made self-conscious â and because, in *
tht- excess of this self-conscioasness.
she stupidly imagines every one in tht:
room must be staring at her. The av
erage -London woman, dressed like a
fashion plate, who rustles in at after
noon tea, with her card-case well in
evidence, and her face carefnly set in
proper "visiting" lines, offers herself up
in this way as a subject for the satirist
out of the same disfiguring self-con
sciousness, which robs her entirely of
the indifference, ease and careless grace
which shouldâ to quote the greatest of
American philosophers. Emerson â
cause her to "repel interference by a
decided and proud choice of influ
ences." and to "inspire every beholder
with something of her own nobleness."
She is probably not naturally formal â â¢
she is no doubt exceedingly constrained
and uncomfortable in her fashionable at
tire â and one may take it for granted
that she would rather be herself than
try to be a something which is a
nothing. But custom ami convention
are her bo^ie man, always guarding
her on either side, and investing her
too often with such deplorable self-con
sciousness that her eye becomes fur
tive, her mouth hard and secretive, her
conversation inane and her whole per
sonality an uncomfortable exhalation
oÂ£ stupidity and dullness.
Nevertheless, setting custom and
convention apart for t'ne nonce, and
bidding thÂ«>m descend into the shad
ows of hypocrisy which is their native
atmosphere, the British woman re
mains th? prettiest in the world. What
a galaxy of feminine charms can be
gathered under the word "British!"
England. Ireland, Wales and Scotland
oner all together such countless
examples of woman's loveliness that It
would be diflicuit, if not impossible, to
give the prize for good looks to one
portion of Britain more than thÂ«
other. America, so far as her s.imples
have been and are seen in Europe,
cannot outr ; val the "old country" in
the prettiness of its women. But it Is
prettiness only; not beuuty. Beauty
remains intrinsically where it was first
born and first admitted into the an
raki of art nnfl" lircraturc. Its home is*
still in "the Isle of Greece, where burn
ing Sappho loved and sung." Nothing
that was ever created in the way of
female loveliness can surpass the
beauty of ;i beautiful Greek woman.
True, she is as rare as a buttertly in
a snowstorm. True, the women of
Athens and of Greece generally, taken
iv the rough majority, are not on nn
average even pretty. Nevertheless the
palm of beauty remains with them â Â¦
because they are always two â or may
be three of them, who dawn year by
year upon the world in all the old
j-<?rfection of the classic models, anrt
who might truly be taken for newly
descended goddesses, so faultlessly
formed, so exquisitely featured are
they. They are not famed by the so
citty paragraphist. and they probably
Trill not get the chance of moving in
the cncles of the British "Upper Ten"
or thr American "Four Hundred." But
thty are the daughters or Aphrodit-i
still, and hold fast their heavenly
mother's attributes. It 13 easy to find
a hundred or more pretty British and
American women for ono beautiful
Greek â but when found, the beautiful
Greek "eclipses them all. She is still
the wonder of the world â the crown
of womanly beauty at its best. She
shows the heritage of her race in her
regal step and freedom of movement â
in the lovely curses of her figure, in'
the classic perfection of her face with
its broad brows, lustrous eyes, arched
sweet lips and delicate contour of chin
ar.d throat, and perhaps more than all
in. the queenly indifference she bears
toward her own loveliness. So

1 T would seem. according to the so
5 ciety press, that beauty Is a very
JL common article. Indeed, if we
are to accent, the innocent ebul
litions of the callow youths who drink
beer and play skittles in the Social
paragraph line or Journalism, and
who in their soft sruilolessness are
taken : a and "used* by certain ladies
of the type resembling Miss Skeggs
and Lady Blarney in the "Vicar of
Wakefield," we are bound to believe
that beautiful women are as common
â¢as blackberries, only more fo. In the
columns devoted by newspaper edi
tors to the meanderir.gs of those in
telligent persons, male and female,
who sign themselves as Onlookers,
Observers, Butterflys, Little Tom-tits,
and what may be culled "X Spysl"
generally, one hardly ever sees the
name of a lady without the epithet
"beautiful" tacked on to it. especially
if the lady happens to have money.
This is curious, but true. And sup
posing the so-called Beautiful One hÂ»;s
not only money, commonly speaking 1 ,
but heaps of money, mines of money,
5h<? is always stated to be "young" as
well. The heavier the bullion the
more assured the youthfulness. If
unkind time shows her to be
the mother of a family where the
eldest sprout is some twenty odd years
of age. the complaisant "I Spy" is
equal to the occasion and writes of
her thus â "The beautiful Mrs. Juno-
Athene brought her eldest girl, look
ing more like her sister than her
mother." Whereat Mrs. Juno-Athene
is satisfied â everybody smiles, and
all things are cozy and comfortable.
c If any one should dare say, espeeially
in print, that Mrs. Juno-Athene is
r.ot "beautiful" at all. nor "youthful"
in either looks or bearing, there would
be ructions. Somebody would get in
to trouble. The "I Spy" might even
.be dismissed from his or her post of
social paragraphist of the Daily Er
ror. Heaven forbid that such a catas
trophe should happen through the in
discretion of a mere miserable truth
monger. Let Mrs. Juno-Athene be
eternally beautiful and eternally
young. by all means, so' long as she
can afford to pay for it. The hum
bug of it is at any rate kindly anJ
chivalrous, and does nobody any
harm, while it puts money in the

ly, and dress is often the "beauty" in-
Fteaxl of the woman. To judge whether
the woman herself is really beautiful
â¢without the modiste's assistance, It
â¢would be necessary to see her deprived
of all her fashionable clothes. Her
bought hair should be taken off and
only the natural remainder left. She
should be content to stand sans paint,
Eans powder, sans black coil, sans eor
eets, in a plain white gown, falling
from her neck and shoulders to her
feet, and thus cheaply yet decently
clad Eubmit herself to the gaze of her
male flatterers In full daylight. How
many of the "beautiful" Mrs. Juno-
Athenes or the "Lovely" Lady Spend
thrifts could stand Fuch a test un
flinchingly? Yet the simplest drap
eries clothe the Greek marbles when
they are clothed at all, and Jewels and
fripperies on the goddess Diana would
make her grace seem vulgar and her
. perf ection common. Beauty, real
" beauty, needs no "creator of costume"
to define it, but is. as the poet says,
when unadorned, adorned the most.
Now it Is absolutely impossible to
meet v.ith any "unadorned" sort of
beauty in those circles of rank and
fashion where the society paragraphist
basks at his or her pleasure. On the
contrary, there is bo much over-adorn
ment In vogue that It is sometimes
difficult to find the actual true color
and personality of certain ladies whose
charms are daily eulogized by an
obliging press. Layers of pearl enamel
picked out with rouge entirely conceal
their human identity. It Is doubtful
lvhethor there was ever more face
painting and "faking up" of beauty
than tb^re is now*-never did beauty
ppecialists and beauty doctors drive
mch a roaring trade. The profits of
beaxtty faking are enormous. Some
jdea of It may be gained by the fact
that th. er e is a certain shrewd and
hichly Intelligent "doctor" in Paris
who, seeing which way the wind of
fashion blows, brews a harmless little
mixture of rose water, eau de cologne,
tincture of benzoin and cochineal,
which materials are quite the reverse
of costly, and calling it by a pretly
sobriquet, sells the same at 23 shillings
a bottle! He is making a fortune out
of women's stupidity. Is this good
â¢ "doctor." and who shall blame him?
Fools exist merely that the wise may
use them. One has only to read the
ladies' papers, especially the adver
tisements therein, to grasp a faint
notion of what is being done to spur
"on the "beauty" craz*\ Yet beauty re

with no hostess to bid them welcome.
She had given up the fight' and was
willing to let the world know that life
with this ninth Duke of Marlborough
was not all roses. She spent last
Easter with her father In Paris.
"Blunderland House" rears Its ugly
form in Mayfair, half completed, the
ugliest structure in all England; a
monument to this latest head of a
noted family.
The story is a strange sequel to the
reports that filled the press of two
continents when 1500 persons crowded
into St. Thomas Church, New York,
that day in November, 1895, when five
dignitaries of the Episcopal church
united in tying the knot that bound
together a family renowned for its
money with one noted for its military
deeds of valor. ,

lite society snickered and the lower

Qf London, and the longer the British
gazed at the great pile the more they
were amused until "Blunderland
House," as it is now called, rivaled
Punch as a laugh provoker in the
English. "So like the Duke!" they
said.
The Duke deserted his task and the
work lagged and almost stopped.' They
gave a great reception for charity In
the Curzon-street house. The Duko
was absent, but no one else In all of
London's smart set. They wanted to
see the Inside of the show and they
did.
Not a room was finished, even the
Duchess* own boudoir was almost bare
of furnishings and but half completed.
Great spaces yawned in the walls
where . priceless Boucher, tapestries
were to have ' hung and carpetless
floors echoed to the tramping feet.
Ornate' electroliers made garish
show in rooms planned for the mel

but where the sun poured in unchal

Young Churchill made his first mis
take in the purchase of the land in
Curzon street, paying Lord Howe
nearly three times what .the site was
worth. He planned the great pile
himself and considerately hid from
the world his architectural mon
strosity in an Immense hoarding until
the exterior was completed. When
"With the outbreak of the Boer war
the Duke felt that opportunity had
come to distinguish himself and he
went to the front, but he returned un
scathed and unhonored. Yet the plucky

for her sake W. K. Vanderbilt hon

in the hope that it would furnish a
common center in which the young peo
ple might find a mutual interest that
would bring them back together.
that drove him furious with anger,
from the House:
"In Africa," he said, "the natives wed
women that they may be supported In
Idleness by them, but far worse is the
practice of impecunious British peers,
who marry rich Americans solely for
their wealth!"
CUCUMBER LOTION (Jessie),
The most valuable elements In this
vegetable lotion are Its astringent and
â¢whitening properties. Coarse grained

it tends to reduce the size of tha pores,
making the skin firm as well as whiter
and thus preventing Incipient wrinkles.
You can readily make tha lotion for
yourself and know that it is pure, using
the Juice from tha fresh vegetable,
which is now so plentiful. Take well

the best â wash and cut Into thin slices
without peeling; stand them in & warm
room until wilted and the Julco begins
to collect in the bottom of the vesselâ
always use an earthen or glass bowl
then finish pressing out with the hands
or a wooden vegetable masher and
strain the Juice through fine cheese
cloth. The ingredients are as follows:
Three ounces of cucumber juice, six
ounces rose water, one ounce simple
tincture of benzoin, two ounces eau da

John Churchill knew no duty save
the duty of a sublime selfishness and
he hesitated at no act to advance him
self. He juggled the national finances
and when advantage offered he un
hesitatingly bestrayed James II, his
King and benefactor, to William and
Mary of Orange. This betrayal profit
ed him little, for it was not until
weak, vacillating Queen Anne came to
the throne that Churchill once more
dominated the court.
Although he had married early in
life, he was a roue and a profligate
who dispensed his favors like a mer
chant selling his wares. History says
that one of his paramours, alone, gave
him S2o 000, an immense sum in those
days. His wife. Sarah Jennings, a wo
man of obscure \blrth and a servant
possessed a rare sympathy for him

days of lax consciences, and while he
Juggled with the stock market at times
to increase his store, he never would
have stooped to Juggle with the
finances and honor of a nation or to
purchase one step in his advancement,
at the sacrifice of a woman's name, as
did John Churchill, the first Duke of
Marlborough.
John Churchill was miserably poor,
with little chance of recognition at
court. He had been educated by char
ity and was a seedy hanger-on on the
outskirts of the notorious Court of
James II, with no asset in the world,
save a handsome face and figure and
the selfish love of a beautiful sister, Ar
abella, Churchill, ever crafty, looking:
well to the main chance, saw in his
sister's beauty an opportunity for him
self and he contrived to bring; her to
the attention of the King.
Arabella became the lultant of
James, and from 'that day John
Churchill knew what It was to bask
In the sunshine of royal favor. It Is
strange that even the military achieve
ments of this man can overshadow
the fact that his almost every step up
ward was due to his sister's position;
that the fortune, the opportunity ha
enjoyed, was reared on the founda
tion of her broken heart.
This viEit of Mrs. Beimont followed
the first sign of trouble, when the press
dispatches told of the Marlboroughs
being in Paris together, but living in
separate hotels. A good deal of noto
riety came of this, but the trouble was
patched up, at least for the sake of ap
pearances. The young Duchess hon
estly loving her husband, wishing him
to do something of which Bhe might be
proud, spurred him on to enter politics
Then the Duke made his famous as
sault in the House of Lordsâ something
that amused England for many a day.
He made himself more or less silly by
a series of dull speeches and nale plati
tudes. The people smiled sympatheti
cally and passed little or no comment
on his effort to be noticed. The Duke
was bright enough to know that he had
made himself absurd, and he blamed
his wife for luring him into a position
where he was a laughing stock.
Then he was appointed paymaster
general of the army and made himself
very much disliked. He aspired to the
vice royalty of Ireland,. but the mas
terly campaign of the young Duchess
was not sufficient to overcome the dif
ficulties In the way and he had to be
content with the â¢ portfolio of Under
Secretary of the Colonies. He made
no mark here and the House of Com
mons began to open up its batteries on
him.
It was at this time that sturdy John
Burns, In a speech on the Chinese la
bor bill, noticing the Duke in the gal
lery, suddenly deserted the plain trend
of his argument to- cleverly lead up to
the remark, aimed at Marlborough,
If report be true, the young Duke
was told plainly that he would be ex
pected to do something; he must make
a mark for himself in the world, main
tain, to outsiders at least, a simula
tion of the affection and respect he
once was believed to have for his
young wife â then money would not be
lacking, in reason. But he was given to
understand that the Vanderbilt dollar
was an honest and a hard-earned coin,
and it was not to be wasted on foolish
extravagances that would bring only
misery to the American girl wife.
The Duke, it is said, made promises,
but seemingly he did not fulfill them.
Probably he thought Vanderbllt pere
would put up more millions rather than
face the scandal of an open breach.
But the Duke had not figured either on
the pluck of his wife or the possibility
of a mother-in-law.
bringing happiness to the young
American wife, who spent most of her
time alone in the great halls of tlie
English palace. The $3,000,000 of a
marriage settlement that the Duchess
had brought her husband was almost
gene, frittered away in a manner
known only to the world of titles.
There was not enough money to keep
up the style he considered necessary
to maintain the dignity of his position
and title.
But the reason for it all. Only a
few of London's millions know this.
The wise ones say the beginning was
In an angry scene" in one of the email
drawing-rooms In Blenheim last
March, when Mrs. Beimont, mother of
the Duchess, braved the lion in his den
and laid home to him what would be
required of him if he expected to find
financial favor at the hands of the
Vanderbllt family. There had been
*ome trouble before this time, many
rather wild extravagances, and the
press was filled with more or less gar
bled reports of the unhapplness of the
young Duchess. Nothing was ever
*ald or related regarding the result of
the visits of Mrs. Beimont to Blen
heim. But since that time gossip has
reached the public In dribs and drabs
until a fairly accurate account of the
scene is reasonable public property.
Sen-ants will talk despite even the
financial advantages of working for
such a family as the Marlboroughs.
Mrs. Beimont, it is said, freely taxed
the young Duke with his shortcomings
and placed before him the only condi
tions, stated to him seven years before,
on which the Vanderbilt dollar would
appear, for despite the fact that Willie
K. Vanderbilt and his first wife long
Â«go decided to go their separate ways,
there Is yet a tacit understanding as
to Just what ftiall be done for young
Marlborough.
His veins, used to the* virus of
bachelor life, inherited from the first
Duke of Marlborough and the seven
irenerations of wild Marlboroughs that
lay between, a dire failure in politics
and anything but a heroic figure in
the Boer war, the old life of the
operas and the vaudeville halls won
back the young Duke and he was once
more leading the life of his bachelor
dsy*.
There may not have been anything
Â«o very terrible in this, but it was not
pleasing to Mrs. Beimont, nor was it
many of the valuable pictures that
adorned the walis of Blenheim shows
this. Dukes Felling works of art at
auction m^ans only one thing. Many
Impecunious titled folk in England
from time to time have parted with
their art treasures to tide over finan
cial stringency, but sales of this char
acter are privately arranged. .Rarely
do they call in the auctioneer.
You will have learned by cable of the
Christie sale. It created a sensation
throughout every part of England.
The famous picture of Gladstone by
Frank Hold, two beautiful Titians, a
Hobbema, jiu Alma Tadema and three
examples of the Italian school that
have Ion? hung on the walls of Blen
heim went under the hammer and
brought but a trifle. This, with the
broad spaces of the walis of unfinished
Sunderland House without the pres
tige of a picture has, of course, set
London Hiking over the Duke"s "sac
rifice."
PACKING CHINA (Mrs. J. M.). â
Professional packers frequently have
bad luck In packing and if I were you
I would not trust china and crystal to
any one but yourself. In the first place
lay in a generous supply of tissue pa

come to your hands, for paper is much

more spring and will give easier.
Wrap the cups and saucers separately
and use plenty of tissue ami then
wrap up each generously In newspa

there generally crumple up a paper
and bury the article in it. for If It is
jarred It will quiver a little and not
be damaged in the least. Barrels are
far better than boxes, for if they are
upset they roll away easily and do not

about and then sew the bag up. When
the sweetness is about gone, rip one
corner and pour some extract of rose
on the sachet bag, for it will freshen it
up wonderfully. Some people like just
a suspicion ef violet with the roses.
IN every club In London and quiet
ly in many of the fashionable
drawing-roams whispers are to be
heard accounting In this and that
way for the supposed enstrangement
. of the Duke and Duchess of Marl

The young Duchess has been seen
more than once dining alone, some
times, too. in the exclusive restaurants,
while the young Duke has on more
than one occasion lately been noted in
his old haunts, the Empire and the
Tivoli. Whatever may be the cause of
the Fpeminjr drifting apart of the
couple, it appears to be a fact beyond
denial that there is some difficulty in
the wmv of a complete entente

The report most common to the pub

never have any fear of being bothered
with lung trouble In any shape or
form, for your chest expansion will
not only be good, but you will have
acquired the habit of deep breathing
and unconsciously your figure will bo
more erect and you will be Infinitely
better to look upon from a physical
standpoint.
Women seldom ever exercise enough
in any way. Housework, mind you, is
not physical culture. It Is frequently
a hopeless grind, and if It Is not too
heavy is good enough In Its own way,
but do not confuse the two. Even in
walking the majority of women are
sadly out of training. Instead of tak
ing a fiab or a car to travel half a
dozen blocks, they should learn the
physical strain of standing, but unfor
tunately their physical strength is so
poorly developed that they are actually
unfit to perform this simple feat, and
instead of doing It simply and easily
they call In their nervous vitality to
help them out and the result Is nervous
prostration or something like It.
Walking worthy of its name is fine
exercise, but to be worthy it must be
with erect trunk, chin up, slightly
drawn in, shoulders squared, drinking
the fresh air Into the expanded chest
as one would drink cool water in sum
mer. The steps should be short and
sharp, the foot leaving the ground with
an emphatic push. Such walking is
fine exercise, taken, of course, in the
open air and sunshine.
Women should cultivate, in fact, all
exercises that give suppleness to their
bodies, for there can be no grace with
out suppleness, as it is really the charm
of carriage which distinguishes one
woman from another.
The exercises in to-day's paper are
for the development of the arms, shoul
ders and chest, and while they are very
slmple, so simple in fact, that children-
and invalids may take them with all
safety, they are most excellent ones,
for they are far reaching and lasting
as well.
In the first place there is a decided
position that you must assume or else
the weight of the body will not be
properly distributed and you will not be
able to go about the exercises in the
correct way. This position is called
for convenience position of attention.
This, by the way, does not necessarily
mean that you must be uncomfortable
or strained in any fashion, for that real
ly is one thing the gymnast takes good
care to avoid. The heels should be cm
a line and as near each other as the
conformation of the body permits. For
instance,, select a line of the carpet,
place your heels against it and then
turn the feet out equally and In such
a way that they form with each other
an angle of about sixty degrees. The
knees should be straight and without
Bt Iff ness.
The body Itself should be erect on
the hips, inclining a little forward,
shoulders square and falling equally.
The arms and hands should be per
mitted to hang naturally with the
backs of the hands outward and the
elbows near the body. Of course it
goes without saying that the head
should be erect and square to the front
with the chin slightly drawn in. but
entirely without constraint. It doesn't
make much difference where the eyes
are when you are having a little bout
with yourself, excepting It Is always
better policy to do, things systemati
cally and well and the various furnish
ings In the room may catch your eye
and distract your attention.
There are three arm exercises that
are simple but effective and I will give
them plainly and in the best order to
take them
1â Raise the arms laterally until hori
zontal, palms upward, until the fingers
rest lightly upon the top of the head.
To get the correct amount of exercise
out of this, the fingers should touch
the head over the forehead with the
backs of the fingers in contact their
full length, thumbs pointing to the
rear and with the elbows pressed well
back. Then extend the palms upward
thtir full length with the palms touch-
Ing. The next position Is the down
ward one and the arms are forced ob
liquely back until they gradually fall
to the sides when the body is at rest.
2â The nÂ«xt one is to develop the
shoulders so that you con'd hold your
hands out perfectly straipht some five
minutes, If needs be, without getting
woefully tired. Swing the hands for
ward and back, making them go as far
dlgnant when It stops and cries for
repairs.
First of all should coma proper
breathing.
It is somewhat remarkable that so
very few of us knor/ how to breathe
properly.' At least there are very few
of us who make a dally practice of
deep breathing â not an occasional
respiration longer than usual, but fifty
or more of them systematically during
the course of the day. Do you know It
is said that nine-tenths of our colds
can <$fae cured in their Inclpiency by
practiced just this deep breathing?
Probably every one of you think you
take as long breaths as are necessary
and so you do to exist, but the aver
age pedestrian takes what Is called a
"half breath." In other words Just
enough to keep things going com
fortably. It is dilllcult, however, to
think to do any task at regular Inter
vals during the day, for it seems too
much like taking medicine, or rather
not taking It, for about one person
In ten remembers the powder or pellet
at the proper time, or even thinks of
It at all if the truth were but known.
But deep breathing is Important
enough to pay one to form the habit.
When one takes a dally walk for ex
ercise alone it soon becomes a natural
and easy accompaniment. This article
is not to be on deep breathing, but I
want to give a little system that is
well worth carrying out, even If one
does no other exercises and deems
them a waste of time and energy, as
Borne busy housewives do.
WhÂ«n you start out take only one
Inhalation to each four steps and ex
pel the air during the next four. And
by the way, always inhale through the
nose and expel throu"h the mouth.
Keep this up for a day or so and then
take five steps to a breath. Increase
elowly but surely and when you can
to the rear as they wd until you are
able to touch th* hands behind the
back. At first you may bÂ« very stiff
and think you never could limber up
sufficiently, but in a few weeks, per
haps even less time, you will be able
to touch them easily and evenly and
the shoulders will develop In a mar
velous fashion If you will keep this up
a sufficient length of time.
3 â The arms should be raised later
ally as in the first position and then a
email circlo should be slowly described
with each arm, upward and downward,
from front to rear. There is only one
"don't" in this exercise, and it i3 easily
understood. Don't allow the arms to
pass in front of the line of the breast,
for the exercise will be robbed of half
of Its benefits if you do.
4 â Another beneficial one Is to raisa
the arms laterally and place the tips
of the fingers lightly on top of thÂ«
shoulders, taking care to keep the up
per arm horizontal. With your hands
In this position force the elbows to the
front as far as is possible and then to
the rear In the same way. In any ex
ercises it is always well to determine
upon a certain number of times to per
form them, for you will be certain to
increase the number rather than de
crease. For Instance, settle upon ten
times and force the elbows to the front
and to the rear Just that many times
and no more, until, of ccrurse, you art
stronger and better fitted to take up
heavier work.
5 â This is an arm exercise pure and
simple and should be faithfully prac
ticed by the girl whose forearm Is
underdeveloped. It is nothing morÂ» or
less than raising the arms half way
and opening and closing the hands with
force. Open the hands quickly, spread
ing the fingers and thumbs apart as
much as Is possible and you will feel
all the muscles in the arm and hand
working and pulling and strengthening
and before very long you will havÂ« a
grip of iron.
6 â The last exercise la yet another for
the arm. but It treats entirely another
part. The forearms are raised until
nearly vertical, with the fingers extend
ed and Joined, palms toward each
other. Now thrust your arms upward
with force, extending them ti* their full
length. The downward thrust is madÂ©
by forcing the arms obliquely back and
gradually letting them fall until they
have reached the sides.
I think it is better to give each set
of exercises by themselves, for then
there can be no danger of confusing
them, but there Is Just one more thtng
I would like to say. Do not be dis
couraged and think that you must de
vote Just so much time every day to
physical culture, for after you have
once got yourself Into good condition It
will take a surprisingly small amount
of dally training to keep up the high
standard.

Important factors both In the pre
vention and treatment of disease, for
there Is scarcely an ailment that can
not be corrected by simple exercises,
out of door life and deep breathing.
And to this end I will give a few
general rules to serve as a guide and
briefly outline the theory or principles
of phj-plcal culture. For, simple as it
seems and really is, there are few who
thoroughly understand its science and
make daily use of it One does not
require a gymnasium with all Its cost
ly settings, for there is a system of
movements that one may do In the
privacy of one's boudoir that will ex
ercise and develop equally every mus
cle in the body and when physical
exercise is carefully distributed, the
entire body 13 built up and strength
ened. It straightway becomes alert
and active; the eyc3 are bright; the
head clear; the circulation regular
and active and it becomes a Joy to
live and one's first impulse on getting
up in the morning is to frisk about as
a colt does in a green pasture.
It is one thing to exercise and quite
another to know how to do it proper
ly. It 13 true that women know tnat
by doing a certain amount of physi
cal training they will never lose their
supple grace, but they ere very apt to
do too much at one thing and not
enough of another. For instance,
there is a certain amount of pride In
every one of us. We like our friends
to think us capable. The consequence
Is we all train in one direction and
when we have found an exercise that
we can do particularly well, we keep
at it until we are quite expert and
neglect other more important ones.
When our friends chance about we
are ready and eager to show off and
cull attention to "my latest stunt,"
but that ends It and we forget to add
that it is our only accomplishment
and that we do it on every and all
occasions. Such work does far more
harm than' good, for one part of the
body is developing abnormally while
another part is really weakened.
When we contract a muscle the
blood It contains is expelled, carrying
with it the old, worn out material.
When the contraction is relaxed the
fresh blood from the arteries rushes
in, bringing with it new material to
replace that waste, for nature is an
excellent physician and does not nt
slect or forget a single treatment.
Every time a muscle Is used she ar
ranges that, all things being equal, the
supply of new material is greater than
the waste, so that the continual activ
ity of the muscle may not be retarded
or the new, fresh supply run out.
People do not realize that every
time they move a muscle or think a
thought they use a muscular or brain
tissue. For years they have been
moving about at will and calling upon
their brain matter without giving
either one or the other proper care or
rest. Yet they expect the machinery to
run on and on for years and are In-

them down among the assemblage at
the foot of the scaffold. The King
and his henchman staggered to their
feet and beat off as well as they
could the multitude that pressed voci
ferously upon them. A soldier strug
gling through tried to arrest the beg
gar man, but the King nimbly wrested
his sword from him and circled the
blade in the air with & venomous hiss
of steel that caused the nearer portion
of the mob to press back eagerly as a
moment before they had pressed for
ward. The man who swung a blade
like that was certainly worthy of re
spect, be he beggar or monarch. The
cobbler's face waa grimed and bleed
ing, but the King's newly won sword
cleared a snace around him. And
now the bellowing voice of Baldy
Hutchinson made itself heard above
the din.
"Stand back from him." he shouted.
"They're decent, honest bodies, even If
they've gone clean mad." â¢
"A riot and a rescue'.** roared the
Sheriff. "Mount, Trooper MacKenzie,
and ride as if the devil were after you
to Stirling; to Stirling, man, and bring
back with you a troop of the King's
horse!"
"It does that," replied the stranger;
still struggling with his mirth; then,
striking the King on the shoulder, he
continued: "I suppose there is not an-)
other roan In all broad Scotland to-day*
but me that wouldn't give the snap of
his finger for all the gold you ever car
ried."
"Then you must be wealthy," com
mented the King. "Yet it can't be
that, for the richest men I know are
the greediest."
"No, it isn't that," rejoined the
stranger, "but if you wander anywhere
about this region you will understand
what I mean when I tell you that I'm
Baldy Hutchinson."
"Baldy Hutchinson!" echoed the
King, wrinkling his brows, trying to
remember where he had heard that
name before; then, with sudden en
lightenment:
"What, not the man who is to be
hanged to-day at St. Ninlans?"
"The very same; so you see that all
the gold ever minted is of 'little use to
a man with a tightening rope around
his neck." And the comicality of the
situation again overcoming Mr. Hutch
inson, his robust sides shook once more
with laughter. .
The King stopped in the middle of the
road and stared at his companion with
amazement.
"Surely you are aware," he said at
last, "that you are on the direct road
to St. Ninians?"
"Surely, surely," replied Baldy, "and
you remind me that we must not stand
yammering here, for there will be a
great gathering there to see the hang
ing. All my friends are there now, and
if I say it, who shouldn't, I've more
friends than possibly any other man in
this part of Scotland." ,
"But do you mean that you are going
voluntarily to your own hanging? Bless
my soul, man, turn in your tracks and
make for across the border."
Hutchinson shook his head.
"If I had intended to do that," he
said, "I could have saved myself many
a long step yesterday and this morn

exasperating tolerance, "I'll to St.

Stirling, put on your King's clothes
and then wome and set me free. That's
"True enough, true enough," con
tinued Hutchinson mildly, in the tone
that he would have used toward a
fractious child, "and you are not the
first that's said it. But let us get on
to St. Ninians."
"No, let us make direct *or Stir
ling."
"Nonsense," cried the King "my
head is perfectly right; it is yours thac
is gone aglee."
"Yes, yes, my man." he said. "I knew
you were the King from the very first.
Just sit down on this stone for a min
ute and let me examine that clip you
got on top of the head. I fear it's
worse than I thought It "was."
Ing. It's only a mile or two farther on.
Let us see the cobbler before running
your neck into a noose."
"But, man. the cobbler will be at St_
Ninians. either with a pardon or to sea
me hanged, like the good friend he is."
"There will be no pardon at St.
Ninians. Let us to Stirling; let us to
Stirling. I know that the King has not
been at home for a week past."
"How can you know that?"
"Never mind how I know it. Will you
do what I tell you?"
"Not I! I'm a lad o f my word."
"Then you are a do-.med man. I tell
you the King has not been in Stirling
since you left St. Ninians." Then, with
a burst of impatience, James cried,
"You stubborn fool. I am the King."
At first the big man seemed inclined
to laugh, and he looked over the beg
gar from top to toe. but presently an
expression of pity overspread his coun
tenance, and he spoke soothingly to his
comrade.
At this critical juncture there rose a
wild shout down the road, for the fight
ing party, in coming round the turn,
had brought themselves" within view of
a sturdy pedestrian forging along at a
great pace, which he nevertheless mar
velously accelerated on seeing the me
lee. For a moment the dazed man on
the ground thought that the landlord
had come to his rescue, but. not so.
It seemed as if a remnant of the storm
had swept like a whirlwind among the
aggressors, for the newcomer in the
fray, with savage exclamations which
showed his delight in a tumult, scat
tered the enemy as a tornado drives be
fore it the leaves of a forest. The
King raised himself on his elbow and
watched the -gigantic stranger lay
about him with his stick, while the
five, with cries of terror, disappeared
Into the forest, for the two that were
prostrate had now recovered wind
enough to run.
"Losh," panted the giant, returning
to the man on the road, "I wish I'd
been here at the beginning:"
"Thank goodness you came at the
end," said % the King, staggering un
steadily to his feet.
"Are you hurt?" asked the stranger.
"I'm not just sure yet," replied the
King, removing his bonnet and rub
bing the top of his head with a cir
cular movement of his hand.
"What's wrong ,wi* those scamps to
lay on a poor beggar. man?" asked the
stranger.
"Nothing, except that the beggar
man is not so poor as he looks and
has a belt of gold about him which he
was foolish tioueh to show last night
at the inn where these lads were drink
ing."
"Then the lesson hasn't taught you
much, or you wouldn't say that to a
complete stranger in the middle of a
black forest, and you alone with him â
thÂ»t is, unless they've' succeeded in
reiving the belt away from you?"
"No, they have not robbed me. and
to show you that I am not such a
fool as you take me for I may add that
the moment you came up I resolved to
give to my rescuer every gold piece
that Is in my belt. So, you see, if rou
thought of robbing me. there'-' little
use in taking by force what a man 13
more than willing to give you of his
own free will."
The giant threw back his head and
the wood resounded with his, laughter.
"What I have said seems to amuse
you," said the King, not too well
pleased at the 1 boisterous merriment of
his companion.
"With whatever's coming to me," he
said, "feed the next beggar that applies
to you on a rainy night with less at his
belt to commend him than I have."
"Well, good day to you, and thank
you," said the innkeeper. "If you're
going Stirling way, your road's straight
through the forest, and when you come
to St. Ninlans you'll be in time to see
a fine hanging, for they're throttling
Baldy Hutchinson to-day, the biggest
man between here and the border â
yes, and beyond it, I warrant."
"That will be interesting," replied
the King. "Good day to you."
Entering the forest at last, he re
laxed no precaution, but kept to the
middle of the road with his stout stick
ready in his hand. At the second turn
ing five stalwart ruffians fell upon him,
two armed with knives and three with
cudgels. The King's early athletic
training was to be put to a practical
test. His first action was to break the
wrist of one of the scoundrels who held
a knife, but before hÂ© could pay any
attention to any of the others he had
received two or three resounding
. blows from the cudgels, and now was
fully occupied warding oft their
strokes, backing down the road to keep
his assailants in front of him. His
great agility gave him an advantage
over the comparative clumsiness of the
four yokels who pressed him, but he
was well aware that any unguarded
bloW'mlght lay him at their mercy. He
was more afraid of the single knife
than of the three clubs, and, springing
through a fortunate opening, was de
lighted to crack the crown of the man
who held the blade, stretching him
helpless in a cart rut The three who
remained seemed In no way disheart
ened by the discomfiture of their com
rades, but came on with greater fury.
The King retreated and retreated,
baffling their evident desire to get in
his rear, and thus the fighting four
came to the corner of the road that
James had passed a short time previ
ously. One of the trio got in a nasty
crack on the top of the beggar's bon
net, which brought him to his knees,
and before he could recover his footing
a blow on the shoulder felled him.
The landlord was plainly disturbed
by the intelligence he had received, and
now made some ado to get the change
for the gold piece, but his guest replied
airily that It did not matter.
by Is asked for and not earned."
"Ah. that's it, is it?" said the other
with a nod. "but for such a trade you
need your weapons by your side."
"The deadliest weapons," rejoined
the King, mysteriously, "are not al
ways those most plainly on view. The
sting of the wasp is generally felt
before it is seen."
"Which way may your honor be
Journeying?" asked the inkeeper, "for
I see that you are no beggar."
"I am no beggar at such an-inhos
pitable house as this," replied the
wayfarer, "but elsewhere I am a beg
gar â that la to say, the gold I come
"Quite right." said the King, "and
only fair Scottish 'caution." Then, with
a lack of that quality he had just com
mended, he drew his belt out from un
der his e-oat and taking a gold piece
from it threw the coin on the table.
The entrance of the King and the
manner of his reception exposed him to
the danger almost sure to attend the
display of so much wealth in such for
bidding country. A moment later he
realized the jeapordy In which his rash
ness had placed him by the significant
glances whicft the half-dozen rough
men there seated gave to each other.
He was alone and unarmed in a dis
reputable bothy on the edge of a forest,
well known as the refuge of desperate
characters. *
When the time came to retire, his
host brought the King by a ladder to
a loft which occupied the whole length
of the building, and muttered some
thing about the others sleeping here
as well, but thanked heaven there
was room enough for an army.
"This will not do for me." said the
beggar, coming: down again. "I'll take
to the storm first. What is this cham
ber leading out from the taproom?"
"That is my own," replied the land
lord, with some return of hia own in
civility, "and I'll give it up to no beg
gar."
The King without answering opened
the door of the chamber and found
himself in a room that could be bar
ricaded. Taking a light with him, he
examined it more minutely.
"Is this matchlock loaded?" he
asked, pointing to a clumsy gun.
which had doubtless caused the death
of more than one deer in the forest.
The landlord answered in surly
fashion that it was, but the King
tested the point for himself.
"No," he said. "I rest here, and you
will see that I am not disturbed. Any
man who attempts to enter this room
gets the contents of this gun In him,
and I'll trust* to my two daggers to
take care of the rest."
He had no dagger with him. but
he Esoke for the benefit of the com
pany in the taproom: Something In
his resolute manner seemed to Im
press the landlord, who grumbled,
muttering half to himself and half to
his companions, but he nevertheless
retired, leaving the King alone, where
upon James fortified the door, and
afterward slept unmolested the sleep
of a tired man, until broad day woke
him.

cobbler.
"Oh. well. I've doubled the number:

"Tha.t"s canny counsel, Flemming,

King of Scotland, with a belt of gold

garments concealing the belt, which

tramped the high roads and byways of

LITERAET' ambition has before
now led men Into flifflmTtif.
The King- had completed a poem
in thirteen stanzas entitled "The
Beggcr Man," and the prime requisite
cf a completed poem is an audience to
listen 10 it.
Like every other literary man. It wae
praise tnu not criticism that James
v. anted: still he preferred to have such
praise from the lips of one who knew
Euincihing ;he life he tried to sine;
therefore, evening came on the mon
arch dressed hin-.seli" In his farmer cos
tume a:id taking his thirteen stanzas
Â¦witU bun ventured upon a. cautious
visit io his lriend thÂ« cobbler in the
lower town cf Stirling.
The cobbler listened with an atten
tion whfch was in itself flattering, and
paid hi* royal visitor the additional
compliment of asking him to repeat
certain or the verses; which the King
in his owa heart thought were the best.
Then, irhea the thirteenth stanza was
arrived at. with the "No-that-bad"
comniL-ndation, which is dear to the
heart ot the chary Scotchman, be he of
high or low degree, Flemming contin
ued:
"They might be worse, and we've
had many a poet of great reputation in
Scotland who would not be ashamed to
lather them. But I'm thinking you
paint the existence of a. beggar in
brighter colors than the life itself wax
rants."
"No, no, Flemming," protested the
King earnestly. "I'm convinced that
only the beggar knows what true con
tentment is. You see. he begins at the
very bottom of the ladder, and every
step he takes must be a step upward.
Now imagine a man at the top, like
myself: any move I make in the way
of changing my condition must be
downward. A beggar is the real king,
and Elinz is l>ut a beggar, for he holds
his position by the favor of others. You
sec, Fle-inmiKg, anything a beggar gets
is bo mu<'ii t<Â» the good, and as he has
border than I am at this moment. No,
no; you see, I have passed my word.
The Sheriff cave me a week among
my own friends to settle my worldly
affairs and bid my wife and bairns
good-by. So I said to the Sheriff:
â¢I'm your man whenever you are
ready for the hanging.' "
"I've heard many a strange tale,"
said the King, "but this beats any
thing in my experience."
"Oh, there's a great deal to be
picked up by tramping the roads, re
plied Hutchinson sagely.
"What is your crime?" Inquired his
Majesty.
"Oh, the crime's neither here nor
there. If they want to hang a man.
they'll hang him, crime or no crime."
"But why should they want to hang
a man with so many friends?"
"Well, you see, a man may have
many friends and yet two or three
powerful enemies. My crime, as you
call It, Is that I'm related to the Doug
lasses. That's ' the real crime. But
that's not what I'm to be hanged for.
Oh, no. it's all done according to the
legal satisfaction of the lawyers. I'm
hanged for treason to the King."
"But surely," exclaimed the beggar,
"they will not nan:: a man in Scot
land for merely saying a hasty word
against the King?"
"There's more happens In this realm
than the Kins kens of, and all done
in his name. too. But, to s:>eak truth.
there was a bit extra against me as
well. A wheen of the daft bodies In
Stirling made up a slip of a plot to
trap the King and put him in hiding
for a while until he listened to what
they called reason. There were two
weavers among them, and weavers are
always plotting; a cobbler and such
like people, and they sent word would
I come and help them. I was fool
enough to write them a note and in
trusted it to their messenger. I told
them to leave the King alone until I
came to Stirling, and then I would
Just nab him myself, put him under
my oxter and walk down toward the
border with him, for I knew that If
they went on they'd but lose their silly
heads. And so wishing no harm to
the King, I made my way to Stirling,
but did not eet within a mile of it,
for they tripped me up at St. Ninians,
having captured my letter. So I waa
sentenced, and It seems the King found
out all about their plot, as I knew
he would, and pardoned the men who
were going to kidnap him, while the
man who wanted to stop such fool
ishness is to be hanged in his name."
"That seems villainously unfair," said
the beggar. "Didn't the eleven try to
do anything for you?"
"How do you know there were
eleven?" cried Hutchinson, turning
around upon him.
"I thought you said eleven."
"Well, maybe I did; maybe I did. Yes,
there were eleven of them. They never
got my letter. Their messenger was a
traitor, as is usually the case, and
merely told them I would have nothing
to do with their foolish venture; and
that brings me to the point I have been
coming to. The moment they set me
at liberty, a week since, I got a mes
senger I could trust and sent him to the
cobbler, Flemming by name. I told
Flemming I was to be hanged, but he
had still a week to get me a reprieve.
I asked him to go to the King and tell
him the whole truth about the matter,
so I'm thinking that a pardon will be
on the scaffold .there before me. Still,
â¢ the disappointment of the hundreds
waiting to see the hanging will be
great."
"Good God!" cried the beggar,
aghast, stopping dead In the middle
of the road and regarding his com
rade with horror.
"What's wrong with you?" asked the
big man, stopping also.
"Has It never occurred to you that
the King may be away from the palace
and no one In the place able to find
him?"
"No one able to find the King of Scot
land? That's an unheard of thing."
"Listen to me, Hutchinson. Let us
avoid St. Ninlans and go direct to Stlrl-
"I am James, King of Scotland." he
proclaimed in stentorian tones. "I
command you as loyal subjects to de
part to your homes. There will be no
execution to-day. The King reprieves
Baldy Hutchinson."
The cobbler stood at the King's
back and when he had ended lifted
his voice and shouted, "God save the
King!"
The mob heard the announcement
In silence, and then a roar of laughter
followed as they grazed at the two tat
tered figures en the edge of the plat
fcrm. But the laughter was followed
by an ominous howl of rage as they
understood that they were likely to

"Losh, I'll King him." shouted the
Indignant Sheriff as he mounted the
Bteps. and before the beggar or his
comrade could defend themselves that
official with his own hand precipitated
"Fool of a Sheriff, say you!" stut
tered that ofiicial in rising anger.
"Here, guard, take these two raga

fold: this is aU your fault. Hangman,
do your duty."
Baldy Hutchinson, begging the cob
bler to make no further trouble,
mounted the steps leading to the plat
form, the hangman close behind him.
Before the guard could lay hands on
the King, he sprang also up the steps
and took a place on the outward edg^
of the scaffold. liaising his hand, he
demanded silence.
"I'll not allow It, If I can prevent It.
and can get this fool of a Sheriff to
listen."
"There's the crazy cobMer again." he
moaned dejectedly. "Xo'.v the fat's all
in the fire. I think I'll hang the three of
thorn, trial or no trial."
"Oh, your Majesty!" cried the cobbter
â and it was hard to say which of the
two was the more disreputable In ap
pearance â "this man Hutchinson is in-\
nocent. You will surely not allow tho'
hanging to take place, now you ar3
hero."
"I am the King," cried the beggar,
overhearing the last word of c.utlon,
"and I warn you, sir, that you proceed
with this execution at your peril. I
am Ja:^s of Scotland, and I forbid the
hanging."
At this moment there broke through
the insufficient military guard a wild,
unkempt figure, whose appearance
caused trepidation to the already much
tri-d Sheriff.
"No, no." continued Baldy suavely,
"It's not that, but he's got a frightful
dunn'-T on the top o' the head, and ha
think3 he's the King."
"I cannot attend to that now," re
joined the Sheriff, with increasing Irri
tation.
"This beggar man." he said, "has
been misused by a gang of thieves la
Torwood forest."
"Bless me, Daldy!" cried the Sheriff.
In a tone of great relief, "I Iiought you
had given me the slir>."
"Ye thought naethin" o* the kind.

â¢'I said I would be here, and her* I

"You are Just late enough," grumbled
the Sheriff. "The people have beea
waiting this two hours."
"They'll think It ai! the better -when
they s:pc it," commented Baldy. "I
was h<?ld back a bit on the road. Has
there no mersage come from tho King?"
"Could you expect it. when the
crime's treason?" askrd tho Sheriff Im
patiently, "but there's beun a cobbler
here that's given me more bother than
twenty kin^s. and cannot be pacified.
He soys the King's away from Stirling,
and this execution must bo put by for
another ten days, which is impossible."
"Allow m2 a word in your ear pri

"I'll se*Â» you after* tho job's done," re
plied the badgered man. "I hava no
more places to give away; you must

Baldy put his open hand to the slda

The King made a gesture of dejpalr,
but remained silent, and they walked
rapidly down the road together. They
had quitted the forest, and the vil
lage of St. Niniar.s waa now In vieÂ«r.
As they approached the place more
nearly Hutcliinson was pleased to see
that a great crowd had gathered to
view the hanging. He seemed to take
this a3 a personal compliment to him
self, as an evidence of his popularity.
THE SAN - FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALU
THE KING
GOES A BEGGINGShe felt as young and took as keen
an interest I in youthful I pleasures as
/ any 18-year-old girl. Sitting there in
the moonlight she, realized that once
robbed of youth a' woman could not
buy the lost treasure back at any
price.
Her childhood had been narrow,
penned in by poverty and an invalid
mother, pettish and exacting. Death
had carried away one burden, that of
unappreciated nursing, only to lay
upon her shoulders another, that of
I part housekeeper, part bread winner.
She had gone into a shop as cash girl
and had attended to the . household
duties night- and morning. When she
was 16 years old she sat up until
nearly daybreak three nights in /suc
cession to set stitches In her sister's
confirmation dress. The sister went
through the high school, so did the
younger brother, and while they stud
led Anna was steadily advancing in
the store. When aha became buyer
for her department and took her first
.'trip abroad it brought back the pink
In 'j her cheeks that fled before her
i tenth birthday, but Anna was now
three times ten.
On her return from Europe Â«hÂ«
found that tha same disease which had
wrecked her childhood and carried
away her mother had again entered
her home. This time It carried away
In quick succession brother and sister.
Anna found herself alona and lone
Â¦ome. She fled to the bachelor maids'
apartments for companionship and
was made welcome by these girls ten
years or more her Junior. With them
she had grown young again. She had
almost forgotten the gray hair. It
had taken the thoughtless boys In
blue serge and white duck to drive the
iron into her heart. They were nica
to her because they knew that the
girls would not forgive them if they
were otherwise. But that was not
youth and the right to be young and
Joyous and silly. Anna sat up very
straight. She had become possessed
of a sudden desire to giggle, yet many
a time and oft she had reproached tha
little cash girls in her own depart
ment for giggling.
Laughter and music floated across
the lawn. They hurt. She rose ab
ruptly and fled to her room. Tha
headache now was real. She tore off
her pretty gown and flung It heedless
ly across the bed and slipped into an
easy flowing kimona. Then she Bat
down by the window, thinking bitterly
that fate had cheated her out of tha
greatest thing, the Joy of being young.
Suddenly as she sat in tha quiet tha
sound of a sob reached her ear. Some
thing Very like a patter of bare feet
came to her from the hall. She sprang
up and threw open her door. A email
figure, huddled against it, fell in
toward her. , ,
"Oh, please, I'm so frightened all
alone. May I come in?"
She recognized her now. It was tha
Berious-faced little girl who had a room
two doors beyond. She had often seen
her on the sand and on the porch with
her nurse. It did not take Anna very
long to learn that the child was moth
erless, In the care of a young and heed
less aunt and an ignorant nurse girl.
The former was absorbed in the social
affairs at the Inn, and the latter in tha
gatherings in the servants' halL Little
Grace had been left quite alone In her
room, and a strong draught had blown
out the lamp, so that between tha
darkness and an ugly dream she had
wakened up In terror. *
That was the beginnlg of a new holi
day for Anna Whelan. The nurse and
young aunt had little to do from that
time on save to provide for Grace's
physical wants. Anna was her con
stant companion. She seemed deter
mined to give this shy ten-year-old girl
all tha companionship, the sympathy.
the simple, unaffected pleasures which
had been denied her own .childhood.
She did not dream that in the moments
when they were not together, Grace, in
her stiff, unformed writing 1 , was send
ing a daily chronicle of their compan
ionship to her father. Nor could she
know of the resentment which filled his
soul against the well-paid and heedless
caretakers of his child, and the curios
ity regarding tha girl with the gray
hair and pink cheeks who was mother-
Ing his bairn. For Graca assured him
in every way that Miss Whelan was
quite as young as "Aunt Hattie."
When he finally came down to spend
a Sunday with his daughter his first
step was to meet Anna. He smiled as
his daughter gravely introduced her as
"My friend. Miss Wl^elan." They were
such an absurdly different couple, and
yet so very much allfce in interests and
pleasures. He found his gaze traveling
constantly over tha brown head of bis
daughter to the gray head of his new
found friend, and he began to under
stand the letters better.
On Monday morning he did not go
back to town, but told his sister Hattia
that he had only just commenced to
realize how the office had worn him
down. He needed a week's rest.
Three nights later he was sitting In
a sheltered corner of the veranda with
Miss Whelan when two members of tha
elderly porch brigade strolled slowly
by, talking in a high-keyed voice which
came squarely to their secluded corner,
"You wouldn't have given her credit
for being so clever. She probably knew
the child's father was worth a million."
"No; I understand ha is not worth
anything of tha sort. Ha is only a
corporation lawyer and I think she
liked Grace for her own sake."
The two women passed out of hear
ing. The pink had fled from Anna's
face, leaving it tired and white. She
rose unsteadily, but the man took her
firmly by the arm and drew her back
to her chair.
"Don't go, please. I know you care
for Grace for her own sake. Do you
think you could care for me for mine?
I wanted to ask you this the first
night."
Instinctively Anna's hand reached
up to her hair.
"Oh, I couldn't. I've known you
such a short time â people would talk
â and â I'm â really too old to have a
love affair."
She did not speak bitterly, Just sim
ply, as if a thought long unspoken
had found utterance. Tha man took
both of her hands In his.
"My dear girl, love never grows old.
and neither will you."
course of the law."
"It's not the first time I've done so,"
said the beggar, with great composure,
and shortly after they heard the thun
der, of horses' hoofs coming from the
north.
"Thank God!" said the Sheriff when
he heard the welcome sound. The mob
dissolved and left a free passage for
the galloping cavalcade. The stout
Baldy Hutchinson and his two com
rades stood alone to receive the onset.
The King took a few steps forward,
raised his sword aloft and shouted:
"Halt, Sir Donald!"
Sir Donald Sinclair obeyed the com
mand so suddenly that his horse's front
feet tore up the turf as he reined back,
while his sharp order to the troop be
hind him brought the company to an
almost Instantaneous stand.
"Sir Donald," said the King, "I am
for Stirling with my two friends here.
See that we are not followed, and ask
this hilarious company to disperse
quietly to their homes. Do it kindly.
Sir Donald. There is no particular
hurry, and they have all the after
noon before them. Bring your troop
back to Stirling In "an hour or two."
"Will your Majesty not take my
horse?" asked Sir Donald Sinclair.
"No, Donald," replied the King with
a smile, glancing down at his rags.
"Scottish horsemen have - always
looked well in the saddle; yourself are
an example of that, and I have no
wish to make this costume fashionable
as a riding suit."
The. Sheriff, who stood by with,
dropped jaw, now flung himself on'
his knees and craved pardon for lay
ing hands on the Lord's anointed.
"The least said of that the better,"
remarked the King, dryly. "But if
you are sorry, Sheriff, that the people
should be disappointed at not seeing
a. man hanged, I think you would
make a very good substitute for my
big friend Baldy here."
The Sheriff tremulously asserted
that the populace were but too pleased
at . this exhibition of royal clemency.
"If that Is the case, then," replied
his Majesty, "we shall not need Â« to
trouble you. And so, farewell to you."
The King, Baldy and the cobbler
took the road toward Stirling, and Sir
Donald spread out his troop to inter
cept traffic in that direction. Advanc
ing toward the bewildered crowd, Sir
Donald spoke to them. â¢
"You will go quietly to your homes,?
he said. "You have- not seen the
hanging, but you have witnessed to
day what none | in . Scotland ever saw
before, the King intervene personally
to save a doomed man: therefore, be
satisfied and go home."
Some one In the mob cried:
â¢'Hurrah' for the poor man's King!
Cheer, lads, cheer!"
A great uproar was lifted to the
skies: afar off the three pedestrians
heard it, and Baldy, the man. of many
friends, taking the clamor as a public
compliment to himself, waved his
bonnet at the distant vociferous mul
titude. . .
(Continued From Page 14.)
TKe King; Goes A-Beg'g'isig'
THE Institution was too new to
Scarcrest to be- treated with'
aught save reverence and awe,
but there was more than one who
dared suggest that David Pres
cott had erred in making his daughter
Marion his paying teller. Not that-
Marion was not suited to the place,
but that even Scarcrest knew that a
woman teller was unusual.
Comment did not worry Prescott.
His holdings in the bank amounted
to more than 90 per cent of the capi
tal invested and at the directors' meet
in? he had offered to make another
choice If the board could suggest any
one better qualified through ac
quaintance or experience at figures.
That settled the matter officially, and
when the spick and span new office
opened it was Marion's pretty blonde
head which was seen through the
plate-glass square lettered "Paying
Teller."
Bert Howard was the receiving teller,
and thla was further cause for gossip,
for Bert had been a willing, slave to
Marion ever since the days when he
used to drag her to school on his sled.
Many comments had been made In
the Dost'ofllce and around the stove .In
Van Zant's grocery, but after Ned
Davis had been soundly -thrashed by
Howard for suggesting that if the pair
of tellers held their positions long
enough they would have no trouble
starting life properly there was an
abrupt cessation of this sort of gossip,
and the bank officers , were accepted
without'further comment.
But it was not pleasant. sailing for
Bert and -.Marion. He -had been given
his position not because Prescott ap
proved of his suit for ; Marion's hand,
but because, like Marion, he had been
the most available person for the posi
tion. Prescott, in his hard, deep-pitched
voice, had assured the young man that
if he ever caught a gUmpse of love
making in business hours there would
be an imported teller in the bank with
in twenty-four hours.
- So It- was that man and maid were
perforce content with such satisfaction
as could come from the knowledge of
the other's propinquity, and even Tony
Dwlght, who would have been glad to
see his rival disposed of, could find no
cause for tale-bearing.
Dwlght, with Prescott, Bert and
Marion, 1 constituted the clerical force
of the First National and oddly
enough Prescott, usually an excellent
Judge of character, favored Tony's as
pirations for Marion's hand. The one
unpleasant feature of her position was
the fact that she had frequently to
consult Tony as bookkeeper and he
never let pass an opportunity to press
his suit.
Then the agent of the Chester Bank
Vault Company came to Scarcrest one
noon hour, driving over from the
nearest railroad town behind a pair
of spanking bays. Curtis was the name
in one corner of the card he present
ed to Prescott as he strolled unan
nounced into the president's office.
But selling bank vaults was appar
ently not his principal business, for
after a while Prescott came out of
his office. "Here i3 a check for which
Mr. Curtis wants the cash," he said,
thrusting the slip of. paper through
the window to Marion. "You have a
package of thousand dollar bills in the
corner of the small safe. There are
twenty-five of those. He will take
the other half in hundreds."
Marion looked curiously at her
father's face, white and drawn.
Â» "Are you sure this is all right ?**
Curtis laughed * lightly.
He moved closer to the bank pres
ident and Prescott, with the muzzle of
a revolver pressing into his side could
only nod his assent. Curtis had as
sured him. that at the first sign of
attempted communication with any of
the two clerks all would be shot and
he would be safe in the country be
fore the crime was discovered. Pres
cott was a brave man, but he agreed
with Curtis' argument that the money
would do him little good If he were
to be shot for refusing it.
i .Marlon grave one more curious
glance at the pair and turned toward
the vault. In a moment she reap
peared. "Oh, Bert," she called, "will
you please come here and help me to
move this box?" .
' -Howard went to her aid, while Cur
tis fidgeted about, urging Prescott to
make haste. There was small danger
of Interruption from a customer or
from Tony, who lunched at that hour,
but being a skillful workman* he liked
to see a job done expeditiously.
In a couple of minutes the pair re
turned. Marlon carried a package of
bills, while Howard swung a bag cov
ered with wax seals.
"I shall have to give you some
gold," said Marion sweetly, as she
tumbled the bills on the shelf beneath
the window of her cage and prepared
to count. "You see we. keep most of
our reserve on deposit in town and
for local use we have mostly small
bills."
"Gold will do," responded Curtis
amiably. "I am not particular, though
of course tha large bills are easier to
handle." '
Howard cans around the corner with
the gold, but beforÂ© Curtis could grasp
the bag of coins it descended upon his
head with force sufficient to knock his
heavy felt hat over his eyes and stun
him before the ready plstcl In his coat
pocket could be fired.
Ten minutes later, under the reviv
ing Influence of ice water applied ex
ternally and brandy in Internal appli
cations, Curtis woke up. Howard stood
over him. completing the work of se
curing him with rope.
"You will pardon me, Mr. Curtis." ha
said blandly, "for not recognizing you
more quickly, but you see the slip sent
out by the Bank of Tacoma gave your
name as Peters, alias Mauvel and
other names. In fact. Miss Prescott
was the first to see your game. No, I
wouldn't hang Miss Preacott." he con
tinued, as he caught the muttered ex
clamation. "You know the proverb
about curses and chickens roosting
home. There Is that little matter of
killing the president and cashier of the
First National of Caswell" He
turned to greet the sole peace officer
of wliich the town boasted.
"That's him!" shouted Tony from
the rear. "I saw him walk up and hit
him over the head."
Constable Post looked about awk
wardly. "I'm afraid there's some mis
take," he growled. "You didn't tell me
It was Mr. Howard you wanted ar
rested."
"Arrest Howard!" shouted Prescott.
""Why, he's just knocked out one of the
slickest bank thieves in the country,
and saved my life as well. Dwight. you
get out of here, you miserable little
sneak. Bert, I'll double the reward the
Bank of Tacoma offers and If you and
Marion can't worry alone on that and
your salary you don't deserve to get
married. Post, you take this fellow
over to the lock-up ar.d give him a
headache powder. I guess he reeds it
after that clip Bert gave him. I'm
going to the telegraph office. Cert, you
and Marion stay here and fix things
up."
From h!s r^anre nnÂ» copld not tell
â¢whether he ir.eant the disordered of
fice- or more important matters. But
Bert and Marion knew, or at least they
used their own judgment.
IT was rot until the tender began tp
t>ob about in a lively fashion that
McCusker would admit to himself
the truth of the suspicion which,
for the past half-hour, had been mo
xcentariJy growing? upon him. Yet he
dared not stop rowing lest the girl
should suspect the truth. He shut his
teeth hard as he bent over the oars.
The gray, dreary mist, which had
ehut d uv.n like a pall, seemed growing
more der.se, and by this he knew that
darkness was coming on. Somehow in
the fog he had missed the yachts at
the moorings, and now the motion of
the tender as she slid over the long in
coming swells told him they were well
cut in the bay.
It was a serious predicament. The
fog gave r.o sign of lifting, and with
darkness coming on the chances of
ependir.g a night in the open boat were
somewhat more than McCusker cared
to contemplate. He glanced at the girl
she eat in the stern sheets, a tiller
rope in either hand. It was evident
from the calmness of her poise that she
had no inkling as to the truth of the
matter. McCusker rested on his oars
and spoke in the most matter of fact
' tones.
" '-Sorry. Miss Cnxy. but vre'va over-
Ehot the mark and pulled past the
yachts in the fog. Hard-a-port,
please. We'll make them in a trice."
Thn Rirl smiled as she brought the
boat about.
McCusker looked at her with undis
guised admiration.
â¢â¢Yep." he said, "wo're really lost.
And, by George, it makes it a lot easier
to have nome one along you can tell
the truth to without sending her into
hysterics."
tThe girl laughed.
"The worstâ tell it all!" she" de
' rnar.ded.
â¢"Well," said he. "we're out in the bay
somewhere, that's evident, and heaven
â¢only knows whore we can find the
yachts. We may drift round all night
âbut not if I can help it," he ended
wiih determination.
He shipped the oars and stood up.
. â¢ "First, we'll see if we can raise any
body," he announced.
He put his har.ds to his mouth and
rhouted again and again at the top
of his voice, but no answering cignal
cam* through the mist
Darkness was fast coming on. The
mist walls which hemmed them in
changed from ghastly white to dull
gray.
"Here's a fix!" he said at length.
"We don't seem to be getting any
where. Are you cold?"
"Not a bit," she said cheerfully.
"Look here," said he, "we simply
must fir.d the yachts."
â¢'Impossibilities admit of no 'muits,' 'Â¦
6he observed, philosophically.
"I know," he said, "but the whole
future hangs on it. If we drift round
all night â you see â that is"
"Oh," she said quickly, "you'd bet
ter row, I think."
There was a hint of distance in her
voice. McCusker dug the oars sav
agely into the water.
"It's this way," he said, desperately,
"ifâ if we drift round all night, you'll
think when I ask you to marry me,
as I've been trying to get up the cour
age to do for weeks, that I'm
prompted to do so by a sense of obli
gation. It will be no such thing, but
you'll think so. Just the same. There
fore, I want to make the yachts and
prove to you I would have asked you
anyway."
The girl was silent. McCusker fan
cied he heard a low chuckle from the
vicinity of the stern sheets, but pro
tracted listening an his part failed to
verify this.
He pulled away with all his might.
Presently he noticed that the tender
no longer rose and fell. They were in
the cuiet waters of the harbor. He
could have shouted for Joy. He bent
over the oars with a new energy born
of hope.
Out of the fog there suddenly ap
peared a light. There was a shock of
collision that nearly threw them from
the thwarts.
"We've found the yachts," said. Mc-
Cusker laconically, and then to a voice
that hailed them from the dark, "I
say. where's the Vesta, old man? Sec
ond boat to starboard? Thanks!"
A few moments later they stood on
the Vesta's deck, Tom Patterson and
Mrs. Patterson and the rest of the
party clamoring for an account of
their adventure.
"The women folks have been Just
wild, Mac," said Patterson, "but I
thought you'd turn up all right. You're
a lucky sort of a chap."
McCusker laughed. Then he looked
straight at Miss Carey.
"Am I?" he asked.
"Iâ I can't dispute Tom," she said,
flushing beautifully.

She wished the might have been

London costumiers are somewhat jeal
ous. Other American society women
are following the example of the Duch
ess, and on the'r return home after
the season their trunks will be packed
with Irish poplins. Count Ward's
women friends particularly are show
ing a partiality for this material, and
it is expected that poplin costumes
will be seen at some of the lavish
entertainments which he proposes to
indulge in during the season. Many
of the American feminine visitors to
London are going over to Ireland at
the end of the London season for no
other purpose than to examine on
the spot the new material which has
become another sort of society craze.
Poplin is by no means a new dis
covery, having been one of the old
industries of Ireland that has survived
the decay of Irish trade. The manu
facture is a sort of trade secret and

to give a great deal of motherly atten

LONDON. Auk. 27.â Seldom has â¢
more pathetic story been told of maaafl
selfishness and pfrfldy and womazrt
suffering and devotion than that whlob
has Just been made publio in Sir Fran

Mr. and Mrs. Morley were married la
London In 1S93. Up to that time she

their wedding they left for Eastern

they had not been long in the colony

She strove to reform him and wean him
from his evil associates and was repaid
by blows and abuse. Broken m health,
by the doctor's orders she returned to
England, taking her child with her.
None of the promised remittances fol

LTVES OX FAT OF THE LAND
WHILE SICK WIFE STARTE3
LONDON. Aug. 27. â When two or
three London society dames made the
discovery recently that Queen Alex
andra had been for years a hearty
eater of celery, these "smart" women
promptly decided that her Majesty's
perennial youth and beauty must be
due to this diet. Accordingly celery
esrting now has become general among
fashionable women, so general In fact
that the "beauty doctors" of London
are beginning to feel the effects of the
new craze In a decided falling off in
patronage. Meanwhile market gar
deners have been puzzled to know why
a demand for celery sprung up so sud
denly In fashionable establishments.
The Queen's celery is grown in Sand
ringham, where most of the vegetables
for the royal table come from, and a
determined effort Is being made by
women who desire to be more beau
tiful to get a sample of the species so
that they may grow it for themselves.
Fruit and vegetable dealers who cater
for fashionable West End people have
as a result of the craze manufactured
a new name for this celery- It can
be seen in the best shops marked up
"Royal Sandringham," the desire be
ing to convey the impression that it
is the same species as that grown at
Sandringham for her Majesty. The
new name enhances the value 50 per
cent, although it is exactly the same
quality that has been supplied to the
purchaser for a number of years back.
MAKES POPLIN* THE FASHION".
Always handsomely and smartly
dressed, though without an attempt
at over extravagance, the Duchess of
Marlborough has struck out in a new
line in the matter of material for her
best gowns. The Queen during her
recent visit to Ireland set the fashion
b"y~~Veari3Mr a dress" made of poplin
and the Duchess seems to have been
the first to follow suit. A few day3
ago a member of a Dublin firm ar
rived in London with samples of the
richest poplins manufactured by the
Mrs. Tower dresses magnificently and
in exquisite taste. Her jewels are fa
mous at court, although she exercises
praiseworthy restraint in wearing what
the best authorities describe as "Just
enough." Her gowns are exclusively
Parisian made and have kept up in
Berlin American women's reputation
as the best dressers in the world- She

countrymen and women resident in or
passing through the Kaiser's capital.
Her periodical luncheon parties to th*e
women of the residential colony and
her receptions on Thanksgiving day
and New Year's, when the patriotic
spirit runs high among exiled Yankees,
are always looked forward to with
delight. A few days ago she gave a
reception for the American delegates
to the International Congress of Wom
en at Berlin, the venerable Susan B.
Anthony being the special guest of
honor. Mrs. Tower's chief supporters
in the brilliant season she has *just
ended with the ladies of the embassy
âMrs. Robert R. Hitt Jr., wife of the
second secretary; Mrs. Hemplln M.
Potts, wife of the naval attache; Mrs.
William S. Biddle, wife of the military
attache, and Mrs. Frank H. Mason,
the widely beloved "mother of the
American colony in Berlin" and wife
of the United States Consul General.
Mrs. Tower has been particularly
gracious in extending the hospitalities
of the court, as far as they are at
her disposal, to visiting American girls,
and at all her functions at which roy-
Thomas A. Reilly of Philadelphia, was
managed to invite "American beauties"
to grace the occasion. Her sister, Mrs.
Thomas A. Reilly of Philadelphia, was
a guest of the embassy last winter
and participated in "any court func
tions.
Mrs. Arthur Paget. working in con
junction with the Duches of Marl
borough, has for a number of years
made children's hospitals in London the
special object of her charity. Like the
Duchess she does not dispense charity
Indiscriminately, but seeks to bestow
her patronage on the most worthy and
necessitous institutions. In this direc
tion she was always guided by the ad
vice of the laite Adrian Hope, who was
for a number of years the secretary of
the children's hospital in Great Or
mond street. He was In failing health
when Mrs. Paget left London for her
visit to the United States and she gave
orders that she was to be kept regular
ly informed by cable of the progress of
his illness. Hi3 death is not llkelv to
cause her to abandon the generous at
tentions which she has always be
stowed on the hospital which was so
directly under his control. It is esti
mated that apart from what Mrs.
Paget realizes through the many ben
evolent entertainments organized by
her she gives out of her own, private
purse no less than 525.000 to $30,000
yearly to charities of this kind. She
is described by charitably disposed per
sons as one of the most accomplished
and persistent beggars among society
Â¦women who devote their lives to the re
lief of distress. Hospital officials de
clare that she has never been known to
fail in extracting a handsome donation
from a friend for any of her pet
schemes. Mrs. Paget'a daughter Is no
less enthusiastic in supporting her
mother's efforts.
Mrs. Henry Seigel's recent action la
taking a house in Grosvenor square la
due. I am to!d. to the fact that without
such a residence she could not hope to
compete with the other rich American
women who are entertaining largely in
London this season. At first she could
not be troub!Â»d with a house and its
servants, so ?he proposed to put up at
one of the West End hotels and do her
entertaining therÂ»: but fashion soon
proved too much for her! . The Grosve
nor square house â No. 51â which she
has taken belongs to Captain Spicer.
and it is understood that Mrs. Seigel
has succeeded in getting it at a much
lower price than if she had entered into
negotiations a month or so ago, when
members of the American world of
fashion were outbidding each other for
town houses for the season. She has
also taken a house at Maidenhead on
the upper reaches of the river Thames,
where she h^s installed her two daugh
ters. In this way Mrs. Seigel has gone
one better than anv of the American
society women who have come over for
the season. Her object is to have
week-end parties at Maidenhead and
allow the daughters to play hostess. It
is estimated that the two establish
ments, apart from the expenses of en
tertaining, will cost her at least $13,000
for the reason. The West End hotel
people, where she was staving and
where it was hoped she would remain,
recognize that they have lost one of
the best of their season's customers.
Count Ward, however, has just ac
quired the suite of rooms which have
been occupied by Mrs. Seigel and at
present he proposes to retain them un
til the* end of the season.

AT HOME TO AMERICANS.
The Kaiser marveled at the beauty
of the embassy and remarked that it
was in full accord with the importance
of the United States as a "world power"
âa hint that blind believers in "Jeffer
6onian simplicity" may well take to
heart. His Majesty escorted Mrs.
Tower to dinner ar.4 devoted himself
almost exclusively to her during the
long and elaborate menu. Prince
Henry was among the other guests, as
well ae a mitnber of German Cabinet
members and distinguished army and
r f avy officers. This was the Kaiser's
first appearance at an embassy dinner
for the season, and the fact that he did
not pay his customary visits to the
Austrian, Italian. British and Rus
sian embassies until later was properly
interpreted In Berlin court circles as a
distinct compliment to Mr. and Mrs.
Tower and to the United States. The
Krnperor remained at the embassy un

formal manner with the members of
the dinner party, wandering about be

â¢ Equipped with her magnificent home,
Mrs. Tower early after arriving here in
1H03 set abcut to entertain in keeping
with the status her country has come
to occupy in the diplomatic and politi
cal realm. Loyally American, her first
formal "at home" partook of a splendid
reception to the American "colony,"

have been zealous in their efforts to
build up the Degree of Pocahontas. The
members of . Potomac Council were

to be reached at some time, sooner or
later, by all fraternal beneficiary asso

misstatement that appeared in this

James says: "After reaching Hono

mands that, if I had. acceded to them,
would have meant breaking up the
company. He said that if these de
mands were not complied with he
would close, so it was either get anew
Dutch 'team or a new show. I naturally
said close. Matters were in this con
dition until the day of sailing, when
Mr. Kolb weakened on his bluff and
came along with the show. As re
gards any dissatisfaction among the
other members of the company, all
statements concerning such are abso
lutely without foundation. Every
thing outside of this connection has
been most harmonious."
Mr. James says further: "The show
was a big hit in Honolulu, playing to
the biggest business ever known in
that city. Everything Is looking fine
for our opening here on Saturday
night*' (Palace Theater, Sydney).
The manager also incloses some

find new questions raised by seeing it,
while those who have seen it only in
Hying to the book for elucidation find
new problems to settle. At any rate
Mr. Shaw has succeeded in setting his
audience a-thinklng, even while they
are laughing as they rarely laugh. In
fact that there is no sort of playgoer
that ran afford to miss "Candida." Its
half dozen players, too, are of the best.

who has made a big pile has thereby
acquired a distinguished social position

land on these shores they generally are

"If they are really people of good
breeding and refinement no harm
comes of it," said a popular member of
the American colony In London, "but
if, as often happens, they are vulgar
and bent only on cutting a wide
swath with their monev. much harm
comes of it, because they are regarded
as fair specimens of the sort of peo
ple who are social leaders in America.
That is one reason why on the English
stage and in popular English novels the
American in society is always depicted
as an atrociously vulgar creature, who
scatters money and bad grammar with
equal indifference. I have known many
wealthy but hopelessly crude individ
uals at home who, after making an
abject failure of their effbffs to get
into society there, have come over here
and made a success of it."
"But how do you and vour friends
propose to stop it?" she was asked.
"By carrying on a secret but active
campaign against Americans who have
nothing i but wealth to support their
social pretensions. Wherever we come
across them we shall take pains to
let it be known that they have no
standing at home. We shall establish
a species of private bureau for the
dissemination of information among
English hostesses concerning the an
tecedents of American - claimants on

us who have taken the matter seriously
in hand to make a success of it. The

| EXPONENT OF THE GEORGE BERNARD SHAW IDEA, NOW AT THE COLUMBIA.
Mr. Daly at first mistook me to mean
the Boucicault "broth of a boy" type,
that shlllelahs through the common
or garden Irish drama.
"Oh, no," he cried. "They grow only
in plays."
Then he told me about a new play
of Shaw's in which the dramatist has
two Irishmen and an Englishman as
chief characters. He intends to make
the Englishman, through sheer racial
insensltiveness, win the girl, by the
way. But it was the two types of
Irishmen that particularly interested
me. One is the educated, self-respect
ing Celt, outwardly like any other
gentleman, his foil the one that wishes
"the top o' the morning to you," and
does the other national stunts for two
pennorth of the crathur. He puts his
property brogue in his pocket when
talking to his own countryman and is
made to confess that he uses it for
revenue only. "In short," the Celtic
critic concluded, "he does what is ex
pected of him, like babies and some
negroes."
We cot back again then to the Eng
lish, Mr. Daly again expressing his
strenuous admiration for them thus:
"During the Boer war time, now. Is
there any other nation on earth that
would have permitted pro-Boer
speeches on the floor of their House of
Parliament? It's sublime, you know.
There would have been shots here.
And at the mass meetings in Hyde
Park the policemen just lounged
around smiling, with a good-natured
dear-me rather-sllly-sort-of-thing-thls
expression. It's noble. How Shaw en
joys it all, too!"
Then he told me something of the
Shaw life, of the exquisite simplicity
of the Shaw houses â there are twoâ of
the dramatist bicycle-riding, of how
he has never had an intoxicating
drink in his life, of how he eats no
meat, and how Mr. Daly himself "felt
like a scoundrel eating meat at Shaw's
table," for the dramatist does not
deny his guests. He laughed as he re-
"Is Shaw serious?" he said, asking
the question of the walls, of me, of
the accusing public. "Mr. Shaw is more
serious than any man now writing.
He's saner. If we do not understand
him, ours is the fault People ask if
he is sincere. He is sincerity itself.
His conscience is absolute. He's a man
thatâ that feels he has certain things
to do. These he makes for in a straight
line. He would better neither you nor
himself if it meant swerving a hair's
breadth to either side."
"Is this his political or artistic con
science you speak of?"
"Bothâ all the consciences," said Mr.
Daly, and pounded the table with a
big, insistent emphasis. "I know little
of his political side, however. He did
tell me he was defeated In something
while I was over there. I tojd him I
supposed I should be sorry but that I
was glad. That kind of man has no
business wasting effort on anything
bo hopeless as trying to drive any in
telligence into the British Govern
ment. It's so incredibly old, so settled
In its stupidity. It makes absolutely
no difference if you are right or wrong,
if you commit the unpardonable sin
of being different. But it Is a thing
most beautiful and wonderful, I as
sure you."
"You needn't," I laugh, "I'm JEng
lish myself. But don't mind me, I'm
enjoying myself hugely."
"You always do." Mr. Daly pro
tested ingenuously, "and why not? You
can afford to. The Englishman al
ways gets there. His imagination leads
him neither to the right nor left. He
walks straight through, right over
everything to his goal. One must ad
mire him. Knock him down and he'll
brush his Â«oat and never know it. He
can well afford to applaud the wit,
gayety and light heart of the Irishman,
because" â very impressive was this
Irishman's voice here â "because every
gift of the Irishman leans to failure."
"Is Mr. Shaw an Irish Irishman?" I
asked. (
"Oh. I begged Mr. Shaw to let him
wear it in the usual way,"' Mr. Dalv
protested, with ridiculously delightful
pathos, "but he wouldn't."
"He usually doesn't. Doesn't he?"Â» I
sympathized.
"Generally." his disciple laughed.
"Hat did I not hear of two Daly
playlets going with the 'Man of Des
tiny' in Boston?" *
"I'm afraid so," the discovered au
thor owned. "I had to have some
thing."
"Did youâ man to man â show them
to Mr. Shaw?' I inquired.
"Did I! I was too clever for that,"
the playwright boasted. "Mrs. Shaw
asked me to" â
"How is she?"
"Wonderfully charming," Mr. Daly
testified. Then he went on to tell me
that he had asked Shaw to write him
a strong love story to companion the
"Man of Destiny." "'I asked him to
write it without any Shaw for the de
light and astonishment of his audi
ences. He suggested that I should
write thirty-five minutes of the play
and give him five â think what he could
do with my puppets in five minutes!"
Mr. Daly crinkled with fearful joy at
the notion. A rich, boyish, buttery
chuckle prefaced the next: "I'd for
gotten all about the love play until
Mr. Shaw came to me one day with
this: 'I've been thinking for some
time of doing a love story to go with
the "Man of Destiny." I was wonder
ing how something like this would go?
Take a young man in love with another
man's wife. He is a very good young
man and decides to renounce the pas
sion as unworthy. Heartbreaking
scenes. The light of a whole life gone.
And so forth. The husband discovers
the situation. Confronts the young
man. Honorably, of course, the young
man denies the lady's love. Husband
bitterly disappointed. Furious!' "
I said something here about Mr.
Shaw's "seriousness."
In a hot moment Mr. Daly had
picked up this commonest little sling
shot used against his idol. Curiously
it seemed as if some swift Invisible tool
were at work on his face, carving
scorn into the lips, the nostrils, the
thinned eyelids. ,-
me rne a play on Cromwell as a com
panion piece. Charles First, you know,
comes in with his head under his arm
â it is a duologue between the two."
"With his. head under his arm! â "
"But it Is so morbid, the gloom so
deadly," the actor protested. "Shaw
is just as serious as Ibsen, but he says:
â¢Let us laugh about it.' Take the scene
betwÂ«en Prossy and Marchbanks. How
would Ibsen have treated it? For ex<
ample, where Marchbanks says, 'Yes,
that is what all poets doâ talk to them
selves out loud. But it's horribly lone
ly not to hear some one else talk some
times.' Prossy's heart is touched, and
Ibsen would have had her say, 'Oh,
ah!' and repeat Marchbanks indefi
nitely, and generally dig it in. But the
other man, with a rapier thrust of wit.
has you laughing while you think."
" 'Candida's, morals' â oh, you don't
mean it!" he continued. "Certainly
Candida's is not the 'I-wiII-be-good'â
Dr. Mun-von sort of goodness. She is
the absolutely saneâ if commercial in
her affectlonal instinctsâ type. She
would no more think of doing that kind
of wrong than you and I would think
of dipping a cup in the gutter to drink.
It's shocking, disgusting, the fashion
in which people pounce upon that sug
gestion of the playâ any play? Shaw
has delivered himself somewhere on
the subject saying 'that Candida has
seduced Marchbanks as far ' You
remember? But of that sentence one
word flames for the uncleanâ shame on
them," the Daly eyes were burning.
"They say again that Mr. Shaw Is
no poet. You said it. I want to see
your face after the last act of 'Can
dida.' "
I asked: "Why didn't Mr. Shaw
write a poem for his poet in the second
act?"
Sunshine again. "He asked me," the
actor chuckledâ "I'd read a bit of Shel
ley thereâ why I didn't recite "The
Boy Stood on the Burning Deck!' Half
past five! I'm half an hour late for re
hearsal! Your fault!"
"So sorry," I said as we came dpwn
stairs, "But I'm not a bit, really."
" 'Ghosts' and 'Candida,' " the â¢ ac
tor decided, .''art the two best con
structed plays ever written, I think.
But look again at the difference.
What is the use of a play like
'Ghosts'?"
"I thought we moderns were content
with 'art for art's sake'?"
Slyly then I said: "But Mr. Shaw
owns that he himself is better than
Shakespeare!"
"And isn't he?" Mr. Daly asked ag
gressively.
"Perhaps he would better be com
pared with Ibsen?" I ventured.
"We didn't have it here."
"You were fortunate," said Daly, get
ting up to stamp around as he laughed.
"Still for those that appreciate refined
burlesque â Edifying spectacle! an
elderly female dressed up as a boy
making love â ooh. And then they call
Maeterlinck the Belgian Shakespeare.
Poor Shakespeare! Mr. Maeterlinck
should remember that 'Romeo and Ju
liet' was written just a few years ago.
I think it's a better play. At any rate
it's cleaner."
called Mr. Shaw's visit to the "Pe'lleas
and Melisande" ,of Sarah Bernhardt
and Mrs. Pat Campbell in London. "I
begged him not to go.* I was afraid he
would be arrested. But ,1 heard on
fairly good authority that he behaved!
I couldn't. Awful, wasn't it?"
He threw back hJ* h'ead in a "long
haired" fashion to this. "I think
You Never Can Tell* will be the next.
After 'Candida' I think it nearer to the
peneral public than any of the other
plays."
I told him then that fascinating ech
oea of his "Man of Destiny" production
had reached us.
. "I want to'do that here," the
raid, " shall do it next spring if you are
fcood to 'Candida.' ilr. Shaw is raak-
Mr. Daly brightened at this to a
quick: "I hope they will like 'Candida'
as well. For, you know?" the brogue
warmed up here and the eyes danced.
"Shaw prophesies that I shall lose all
kin,ds of money with the play. He
nays, "and the sooner you get rid of it
the better â that syndicates are formed
to lose money,' but he's been wrong so
far." The "he" should be capitalized to
ylve it the Daly color. "I've made
money on Shaw, and I'm going to try
It tome more." You would take several
chance* on a thing that Arnold Daly
BSjrs he will "try eome more" if you
heard him say it.
I asked lust what Shaw the actor
would next venture to rescue from its
literary notoriety.
Without undue vanity, I hope, I
subjoined to this that for the first
night of "The Devil's Disciple," pro
duced here last year by Henry Miller,
the house was sold out.
"that you* will not feel about the play
as I heard two youths in Sal^m ex
press themselves. 'Well?',, said one.
"Got to me for two bucks,' said the
other." ("Two dollars." Mr. Daly trans
lated for my ignorance.)
"I think I can promise better than
that for us," I ventured.
"You really think it will be liked?"
he asked. I remembered then that
upon Arnold Daly's young shoulders â
like Cousin Kate he is only 29 â lies
the whole anxiety of the production
of "Candida." "Mind." he added, "I
do not expect too much. I'm no the
orist. I know that when you begin to
Bell 'Apollo* instead of 'Slapolio' it
takes time, whether it is in London
or San Francisco."
"Oh, mayn't we talk about the type
writer?" he asked, nodding over at
one.
. "Next time," I promised.
"I hope only," the actor said then,
"Then we may talk about 'Can
dida.'?" I insinuated. I had heard that
Mr. Daly preferred to talk of any
thing elseâ except George Bernard
Hhaw. Naturally I wanted to hear
nbout both. i
and worry and difficulties of a pro
duction." From which I perhaps er
roneously gathered that the actor folk
had not been wholly generous in their
appreciation of the Daly efforts. â¢
"He's just been here." I threw in.
"Yes. I know. But you reminded
me," Mr. Daly began, clasping his
hands over his knees, as I think he
would have clasped McRae's had he
been there, "you reminded me of the
most welcome letter I received con
cerning 'Candida' â I have had only
nbout 2000. Bruce McRae wrote it."
"Ah?"
. "dimply â well, it ran just about like
this: "Dear Daly: How can we thank
you? Always your debtor.' That was
all. But you see 4t came from an ac
tor, onÂ» that understands all the work
' ' "Wonder why every one remembers
<that?" the actor speculated. "I said it
one day and the next woke up to find
myself a famousâ 'Mick.' I'm it on
both sides and for billions of years
back," he answered then.
â¢It's just like Bruce McRae>," I
murmured.
â¢What is?" Mr. Daly asked.
"The accent, of course," I laughed.
He asked me with the "gravity of the
humorist," "Irish, is it? really? Well,
in Londun they label it American. Then
in New York they brand it English*.
The only safe place for me to play â
as. Maurice Barrymore used to say â
is' on the trans-Atlantic steamers'.
But Bruce McRae â "
. Then I asked: "And how much of a
: M-ick' are you. Mr. Daly? You said
'rhu 'would rather be a Mick than a
king.' you know."
I owned up to the long hair. I had
sfen Mr. Dalv so picturedâ hyacinthine
locks about a broad brow, soft collar
and the rest of it. as the t>oet in "Can
dida." And I -had identified this fore
most disrtple of Shaw with them.
Well? Not at all like this was the mat
ter-of-fact person facing me â at least,
I thought so then, for Mr. Daly is only
"long-haired" inside. However, I had
time only to note the extreme every
dayness of his suit, the short, business
like hair â when I caught the elint of
the Daly eye. Probably Mr. Daly
Â¦a ears shoes and is collared like the rest
of his tribe. Probably, too, there was a
table in the business office of the Co
lumbia â where we were â for Mr. Daly
hunched it instead of the public eye that
sees nothing but the "shawl" speech in
"Candida." There must also have been
* typewriter, for the actor suggested
talking about it when I first mentioned
the comedy. But of these things and
anything else there I have onlv cir

Curiosity as to the eleusinlan mys

will doubtless help to fill tho Tivoli
next Thursday afternooon, when a
kind of public "jinks" is to be given by
the famous club. Though they will not
have their columned amphitheater, nor
the scented gloom of the grove at
Guerneville, they are to give to the
public ear some of the melodies that
have so far echoed onlv tnerein.lt has
been decided that it was unkind to both
the composers and local music lovers
to allow these compositions to remain
practically unknown. Last year, it will
be remembered. Fritz Seheel pro
duced with much success portions of
Dr. H. J. Stewart's "Montezuma," the
musical setting of the "high jinks"
drama by Louis J. Robertson, and it
was probably the interest shown there
in that determined the Bohemians to
give the affair of next Thursday. Not
only will "Montezuma" be given, but
selections from the preceding year's
festival music by Joseph D. Redding,
together with this year's music done by
W. J. McCoy. The composers will con
duct in each case, and there will be a
picked orchestra of sixty men at their
service. The formation of the orchestra
has been left in the competent hands of
Mr. Redding.
One heara very good things of Mr.
McCoy's setting of 'The Hamadryads,"
this year's drama. There is. I am as
sured, some charming choral writing in
the work, a striking "Processional
March," a fine "Supplication" and a
stunning symphonic overture. It i3
worth mentioning that Paul SteindorfC
is among my informants. Indeed. Mr.
Steindorff put it that "hardly too high
praise" can be given to some parts of,
the -McCoy work.
Then there are to be further fasci
nating confidences in the shape of
readings from the "Jinks" books of the
last three years. One can hear music
any dayâ but these! And the affair is
to be a genuinely public one. The
members of the club> have been re
stricted in their purchase of tickets to
four apiece and to-morrow morning the
remainder will be placed on sale at the
Tivoli box office, the prices to be: For
the top gallery $1 and for the rest of
the house, with the exception of pri
vate boxes, $2. The business side of
the entertainment is in the hands of
William Oroer Harrison, V.'illard Bar

General Payne's suggestion that the
time is at hand for a 2-cent postage
between the United States, Germany
and Great Britain, although the sub
ject of favorable comment in the
press, is not regarded at the Ministry
of Posts as feasible. Such a proposal
In the International Postal Congress
would bring, out .an .Instructive inter
change of views, but the German pos
tal delegates would be against its
adoption.
Were Germany, to reach a 2-cent
agreeement with the United States it
would be expected a,lso by her neigh
bors, Switzerland, Belgium, France
and Holland. Â¦ Consequently the ques
tion must be considered by Germany
as a proposal for a one unit postage

necessary if the Russian ships are not

"While Japan sincerely hopes that
the reported intention of Russia to
disarm the Askold and Grozovol at
Shanghai will promptly be executed.
my Government has felt that it .was
advisable to inform the powers what

Â¦DUBLIN. Aug. 27.â Weight is at
tached to the new Irish Reform Asso
ciation as another step in the move
ment toward Irish self-government. It
was founded by Lord Dunraven and
: Lord Mayo end the other landlords
Â¦who participated in the land confer
ences. It purposes to organize a body
of Irish opinion, particularly among
the upper classes, to press reforms in
dependently of the claims of the Na
tionaltets and of the reactionary Ul
rter Orangemen. While the association
'h&a not a. Eirgle member in the House
of Commons, its views may be useful
to the Irish party through its represen
tation in the House of Lords, consist
ing of about a score of peers.
Captain Ehaw-Taylor. one of the
prominent organizers of the movement,
makes no secret of the fact that he
and many of his colleagues aim event
ually at home rule, although they are
refraining for the present from any
euch declaration, lest - their possible
supporters should be frightened off.
However, the first step in the direction
of home rule is evident in the asso
ciation's attitude in favor of treating
Ireland as a separate financial entity.
Instead of the Irish money going into
the imperial exchequer, making its ex
penditure for Irish purposes dependent
upon English treasury officials and
thus being represented as a kind of
English generosity, the new Idea is to
place earmarks on the Irish funds, note
how much Ireland pays in, assign a
e-hare for imperial purposes and use
1 the remainder for Irish purposes in ac
cordance with the Irish opinions.

mounted 'only -two small guns when

The assault : 'was ' preceded by heavy
artillery fire from Takushan, where
the. JTapanesÂ© -have "big. naval guns.
The Russians lost considerably before
they were compelled ,. to retire. The

tremendous labor, raised the summit
cf a smaller hill behind it to the level
of Etzshan Hill by means of sand

PORT ARTHUR SITUATION.
The fighting *it Tsegow was of the
most desperate description. The Jap
anese hud the advantage of mountain
ous couiury, advancing along a ridge
Jrom Tantsiaputzy to Siao
lindzy. The latter place is situated
c:j the high road, ten miles southeast
of Liaoyang. Possession 'of this point
would render Liandiansian and An
pfng untenable. It la not improbable
that General Kuroki therefore will re
peat his attack in this direction.
The Japanese advance was charac
terized by the createst boldness and
arouses the belief In military circles
that cither General Kuroki has re
ceived considerable reinforcements or
that General Kuropatkin has, sent the
greater portion of his army northward,
leaving only a couple of corps at Liao
yangr. The absence of news of a Jap
anese movement along the Taitse
Kiver in order to flank Liaoyang con
firms the latter view, as It would ex
pose the attackers to being cut off by
General Kuropatkin's main army from
the north.

TOKIO, Aug. 27.â No tidings of a
definite character from Port Arthur or
Liaoyang have reached the public to
day. It is understood that a lull fol
icJYved* the desperate fighting of the
earlier half of the week at Port Arthur.
The lull was for the purpose of allow
ing the tired men to rest, arranging
certain changes in the plan of attack
and for completing preparations for
pressing the attack home. The Japan
ese guns continue to shell the defenses
of the fortress, but the majority of the
forces are not engaged.
Port Arthur is proving harder to re
duce and capture than the general pub
lic of Japan expected. The public,
which has confidently awaited the fail
of the fortress daily for the past month,
is disappointed at the delay. Much
regret is expressed at the heavy losses,
but the nation is unwavering in its
grim- determination to.- hammer and
harass Port Arthur until- it falls, and
it Is, prepared to pay the. cost, how
ever heavy it may be. \
A cannonade began southeastward at
5:30 o'clock in the morning, and an hour
later a fusillade was maintained along
the whole southeastern front by the
Japanese infantry against the right
flank of the Russian position. This at
tack was repulsed at 7 o'clock. At 11
o'clock a Japanese batrery of twenty
four guns on Tunsinpu Hill was si
lenced and put out of action by the
Russian batteries, and the Russian bat
teries and the Russian covalry dis
persed the Japanese.
At 1 o'clock the Japanese made a hot
attack against Kofyntse, and consider
able Japanese forces were discovered in
the neighborhood of Laodintan.
All the Japanese attacks were re
pulsed and the Russian troops, taking
the offensive, drove the Japanese back
toward the Navikau Valley. The Rus
sian losses thei-e were about S00.
In an eastern direction at dawn the
Japanese took the offensive against the
whole front on the Russian right. The
troops retired from their advanced po
sition, thus hindering the action of the
artillery. The engagement at this point
was serious and became a hand-to
hand conflict. The Russians, according
to this report, lost about 1000 men
killed or wounded.
JAPAXESE GDXS SILEN'CED.
The Japanese force consisted of a di
vision and a half, with artillery. : The
Russian advance guard retired on the
main position. The Japanese attack
there was not obstinate. The Russian
losses on the southern front were 150
men.
The General Stuff has received a dis
patch from General Sakharoff, giving
a lengthy detailed account of the fight
ing of August 20. He says that on that
flay the Japanese took the offensive
along the whole front of the Manchu
rian army. At an early hour the Jap
anese occupied the railway at Henchu
antsa, repulsing the Russian advance
posts. Toward noon the attack in that
quarter ceased. Before dawn the Jap
anese were concentrated against . the
Russian advance detachments ot.the
Anshanshan position. ... ,
"At dawn of August 26 the Japanese
assumed the offensive along the entire
front of our army."
A dispatch from General Kuropatkin
to Emperor Nicholas dated August 26,
and referring to the fighting of-Au
gust 25, says the Japanese took the of
fensive only against the troops on the
Russian left. The strength of the Jap
anese was estimated at two divisions
of infantry, with numerous guns. The
Russian losses in killed or wounded
were about 100. The dispatch con
cludes:
pecially severe. Bayonets were used
and there the Russians lost 1000 men.
The Japanese line on the west is ap
proximately, according to the advices
received here, three and a half miles
from the European, or new town,
where there has been no general con
flagration, although numerous indi
vidual fires have occurred.
When the latest -arrivals left Port
Arthur .. there was little firing. The
strength of the garrison is now esti
mated to be 15, 000. efficient men. I On
August 23 the Russians arrested four
Japanese spies within the fortress and
shot them. No Chinese except out
bound servants are allowed in the
European town, the j Russians being
afraid of spies.-
Since August 21 the Russian ships
have not been firing shells. On 'Au
gust 22 a Japanese shell fell in the
dockyard, causing some damage.
Only the Chinese shops of Port Ar
thur are doing business. The lack of
vegetables is severely felt.
the announcement made in these dis
patches on August IS Â¦ to the effect
that the Japanese drove the Russians
from their positions at Louisa Bay and
Pigeon Bay. The Japanese vanguard,
numbering 500 to 600 men, pene
trated into the fort situated on the
highest hill of the Liaoti Mountain,
the southernmost, mountain of the
Kwangtung Peninsula, incidentally
capturing an incompleted battery on
the west shore of the Liaoti Promon
tory, and then retired. The Japanese
fleet, during the attack, made a
demonstration against the main Liaoti
fort.
It is also confirmed that the Jap
anese silenced a small fort near
Golden Hill.

It is the contention of the plaintiff
that if the defendants are allowed to
do these things that a large amount of
water would never get back into the
stream. /
The city is fighting to prevent the
use of waters of the river for large
irrigating enterprises. The complaint
sets forth that the defendants claim
adversely to the piaintiff an Interest in
the paramount right to the waters of
the 'river and that the defendants
threaten during the irrigating season,
from May 1 to November 1 of each
year, and at other times* they desire,
to divert the .water by means of pumps
and wells.

withstanding a steady courtship of fif
teen years. Miss Rosa Wickerstrom of
Denver, Colo!, a niece of Senator Ta
bor, came to Portland this week to
marry W. C. Cutler of Baker City.
Cutler had been waiting here two
weeks for the arrival of the lady. He
had favored an intimate friend with a
"tip" concerning his expected happi
ness and partial arrangements were
made for the wedding to occur at the
home of this* friend. But when the
bride-to-be arrived Cutler's courage
proved unequal to a meeting with the
few invited guests and the couple
boarded an electric car Tuesday after
noon and went to Vancouver, where
they were married.

ASTORJA, Aug. 27. â A duej to th

of this city, between John Adams o
Knappa and James D. Brewer. Mr
and Mrs. Adams had been vlsitinj
v.-ith Mr. and Mrs. Brewer.
The iron and steel situation contin
ues unsettled and further cuts in
prices have been reported. That these
reductions have brought much addi
tional business is a matter of dispute,
though several large orders for rails
and other materials have recently
been placed. -
The stock market has been Irregu
lar, but it cannot be denied that spec
ulation has been characterized bv a
strong undertone. In the latter part
of the week some substantial buying
of the Harriman* shares, the Gould
stocks and the grangers imparted a
decidedly strong tone to the list and
there is a feeling that the early re
turn of certain powerful railroad and
financial magnates from abroad will
be followed by important develop
ments and a broader and more active
market. The Investment demand for
gooti securities has practically cleaned
the market of high grade bonds, and
bankers now look for investors to
give their attention to the better class
of railroad stocks.
The labor situation la complicated
by strikes and lockouts, but th^se
have received little attention from the
market. The political situation is not
a marked factor and is practically ig
nored. The war in the Orient at
tracts only passing attention and has
had little influence on price move
ments. The technical position of the
market appears to be the dominant
influence, and a scarcity of stocks is
shown by the fact that bear attacks
and bad news ha,ve failed to dislodge
holdings or to force any liquidation.
It is an admitted fact, however, that
the public is not in the market, nor is
there any indication that it Is likely
soon to become interested. ;;-,
Attempts to create a corn crop scare
met with some success, but reliable ad
vices do not indicate' any serious in
jury. The safety of this crop is very
important, not only from the market
standpoint, but because a large crop of
corn is counted on to offset any damage
in wheat and provide the railroads
with a large tonnage. In reviewing the
crop conditions the conclusion is
reached that the' total harvest will be
larger than that of last year, while
higher prices will naturally give the
farmer larger returns and increase the
buying powers of the Southwest.
The monotony of the money market
this week was broken by the initial
movement of currency to Western and
Southern points, also to Canada. Cu
ban exports also continued. The
movement of money from this center
is now on and the loss to the banks
will be reflected in declining reserves,
but the large holdings of tne associat
ed banks make any marked advance
in money rates extremely improbable.
The funds now to be drawn will be
employed in the crop sections and will
doubtless stimulate commercial activ
ity.
CUTS IN STEEL PRICES.
Perhaps, the most conspicuous feature
of the week has been the absolute in
difference of the market to. develop
ments, which ordinarily depresses the
list. This disregard of unfavorable
factors? is supposed to have reflected
confidence on the part of the banking
interests of the country. In some quar
ters market conditions are* attributed
largely to manipulation.
The croD condition was and is the
chief point of interest, but develop
ments have^been so conflicting that a
definite opinion as to the reported dam
age must be reserved until the publica
tion of the Government report. Dam
age reports relating to spring wheat
have been less sensational, and reliable
authorities practically agree upon a
total whfeat crop of 505,000,000 bushels,
but this will not leave any material
surplus- "Wheat prices toward the end
of the week made marked recessions
from those of last Monday, and it is
expected that the Government report,
due September 5. will show that the
damage has been greatly overestimated.
NEW YORK, Aus. 27.â There is lit
tle to be said for to-day's stock market.
Buying during the greater part of the
brief session was very dull and narrow
and the was rather irregular. Lon T
don sent lower prices, and renewed ac
tivity in the commodity markets prob
ably accounted for the attitude of the
trading element. A private estimate
that the wheat crop is likely to fall be
low 250,000,000 bushels, or less than that
of 1901 and very much below that of
last year, commanded serious attention
in many quarters. The monotony of the
day was enlivened by gossip that the
Union Pacific "and the Missouri Pacific
were to. engage in rate cutting for steel
products, also of a reported fight be
tween the United States Steel Corpora
tion and the Colorado Fuel and Iron
Company. There were fractional de
clines at the opening in Union Pacific
and Atchison. The leak in Canadian
Pacific was natural in view of the
stock increase. The list steadied some
what after the early reaction. The
publication of the bank statement,
showing a much smaller loss of cash
than had been anticipated, was of sen
timental value, even though the state
ment was based upon the so-called sys
tem of declining averages. Trading be
came rather animated in the final deal
ings, with practically all the active list
sharing in the upward movement. The
market closed firm, with" prices in some
instances better than the previous?
day's close. Another telegraphic trans
fer of $500,000 to Chicago was riiade by
the sub-treasury. Total sales of bonds,
par value, $1,270,000.

ti"!d his wife that he would go to the
Lara and get his houses on high
ground. A few minutes later a body of
water struck the house and before
Mrs. Jones and her son could escape
from the building it was swept from

tree some - thirty yards down the
stream. One portion of the house was
washed on down the stream, but for

were able to make their escape.
Three were uprooted and thrown

â¢ STORM STRIKES REDLANDS.
All available prison guards, with
the assistance of the Marin County
officers, made a careful search of the
surrounding country last' night and
the Fan Francisco police kept a watch
on the ferry-boats, but the escapes
successfully evaded capture.
Warden Tompkins received infor
mation this morning that two suspi
cious characters were seen loitering
in the vicinity of Mill Valley, but the
descriptions of the suspects did not
tally with those of Kelly or Montague.
James Phillips, who escaped from
San Quentin last April while herding
f-attle near the hog ranch, managed to
evade liis pursuers for two weeks, but
was finally captured at Geyserville.
Warden Tompkins says Montague
is a hard charncter and will probably
put up a fight before being captured.
Some of the guards think the crim
inals escaped in a rowboat, as the
ranch Is close to the water.
SAN RAFAEL. Aug. 27. â Dan Kel
ly and F. W. Montague, who escaped
from San Quentin prison yesterday
afternoon, have not yet been appre
hended. Montague was last ne-?n at
the hog ranch a quarter of a mile
from the prison, and Kelly was last
i:een near the prison. The men were
always together and the supposition ;s
that Montague concealed Kelly in hi3
garbage cart and that both escaped
together.

DESPERATE CONVICTS WHO ES
CAPED FROM SAN QUENTIN
PRISON* ON FRIDAT.
To Â«put in all the names of those
writing "sublime," "fine," "excellent"
and so forth after their names would
take several columns. Some are used
merely to extend the range of locality.
It will be observed from the expres
sions used that some among the low
ly were inspired to express their ad
miration of San Francisco. Who these
were It will be left for the reader to
determine. At any rate they all had
enough money to travel quite a dis
tance to St. Louis. Where Red Wing
is unfortunately Is not stated by the
citizen from that place, but It will fit
in any locality not covered.
T. C. Hartman of Tacoma cannot
forget the changing of the name of
Mount Tacoma to Mount Rainier. He
looked at the art display and the
pictures of big buildings and shipping
and then wrote after his name on the
register, "Where la Seattle?" After
this the Tacomalte's enjoyment of the
fair was probably 100 per cent greater.
The signature "J. Menderaon and
family, Cincinnati," is followed by the
statement. "Will be there In July,"
which Is an Illustration of how the
exhibit Impresses the people.
The visitors to the San Francisco
building are largely of the wealthy
class, and the entire State of Cali
fornia }s benefited through their being
attracted to the place. They do not
ask about San Francisco only, but
many Inquire about fruit, olive and
wine culture In the State, and are
given Information concerning -lands
and products of California, The San
Francisco building will be responsible
for many land buyers going to Cali
fornia. It Is one place where every
section of the State from end to end
is represented.
People from every part of the globe
have written something about the San
Francisco exhibit. Many content
themselves with one adjective, and
such words as "Good," "Unexcelled,"
"Lovely," "Fine," "Delightful," "Won
derful," "Sublime" and "Splendid" ap
pear in the remarks column with great
frequency. Some of the interesting
marginal notes are as follows:
"Most instructive," Hector von Aug
tenberg, Colombo, Ceylon; '.'splendid,"
Mr. and Mrs. E. C. Goodrich, Grand
Rapids, Mich.; "Viva! San Francisco!"
Esteban Dugue Estrada, Havana,
Cuba, "hospitable as Baltimore," Wil
liam Baker and wife, Baltimore, Md.;
"great is Frisco," Frank Lemont, En
sely, Ala; "the City of Bohemians."
Louis Brown, New York; "fine and
dandy," Miss Lizzie Kelley, Pittsburg;
"out of sight," Minnie Ingersoll,
Pittsburg; "up to tho standard of "the
Golden State," L. Langfelder, Fort
Smith, Ark.; "exhibit fine," L. H.
St hnackenberg, Cornwall, N. T.; "per
fectly lovely," Sara Dargo, Cleves,
Ohio; "best on the grounds," L. Brink
man, New York; "nicest exhibit on
the fair grounds," Hugh Bates, Belle
Vernon. Pa.; "sublime," L. W. Hodg
man, Red Wing; "splendid," L. \V.
Alderman. Raleigh, N. C; "the
goods," Harold D. -Cowan, Buffalo, N.
Y.; "finest on the grounds," Elsie W.
Wehling, Bellevue, Pa.; "best yet," S.
C. Hendricks, Marlon, Ind.; "it's fine,"
George Pendexter and wife, Austin,
Tex.
A lady from Pasadena takes occasion
to write after her name, "All good but
the climate." San Diego is more gen
erous, for four of her citizens write,
"No place like California, and San
Francisco is its center."
Another one of the big registers sent
on by the San Francisco committee has
been filled, and a temporary one has
been supplied by J. W. Erwln, the com
mittee's representative. It contains a
space at the margin for remarks, and
most of the visitors who register do not
overlook the opportunity to unload their
sentiments. Some mistake the purpose
for which their remarks are desired and
apply them to themselves or existing
conditions utterly extraneous to San
Francisco. Such marginal notes as
"I'm tired," "It's hot" and "Raining"
appear at intervals.
All the "remarks" bearing on San
Francisco are extremely complimen
tary, save two. Miss Katherine F.
O'Connell of Chicago gazed about the
building, saw no gilded shoats' heads
on the frescoes and cruelly and calmly
wrote in the remarks column, "Poor."
This is one of the preliminary rum
blings of the thunderous acknowledg
ment of San Francisco's greatness that
must come from the East. No city or
individual can be truly great until it
or he is "knocked," and this faint be
ginning of the good work by a weak
woman, insignificant as it Is in Itself,
is portentous of the great things com
ing to the great city beside the Golden
Gate. It is premonitory of a storm
that is to burst and glorify the West
ern metropolis. Only when she is well
hammered by the other great centers
of trade can San Francisco feel that
she is indeed one of the leading ones
of earth.
The matter of securing a visit from
these notables is now in the hands of
the public bodies of California, having
been referred to them by the State
commission. All of the South and Cen
tral American republics will send repre
sentatives. A visit from these latter
would probably be of particular benefit
to California. .

BY PAUL EDWARDS,
SAM BERNARDINO. Aug. 27. â
The fourth section of the -westbound
Santa. Fe train running as No. 9,
Â¦which has been detained In Arizona
by washout* for the last four days and
had been switched to the Southern
Pacific tracks via Derninff, N. M.. ran
into & cloudburst again this afternoon
between Beaumont and Hinda, Cal.,
east of San Bernardino on the main
Una of the Southern Pacific. The rain,
accompanied by hail and a stiff rÂ«de
of wind, came down in torrents, waah-
Inr out bridges and roads and pour
ing rivers of water down from the
hills that flooded the railroad tracks
and destroyed the telegraph lines.
When No. 9 encountered the flood
ten inches of water was pouring over
the rails and threatened to carry away
the tracks at any moment- The en
gineer pushed his train forward, how
ever, and succeeded in crossing the
flooded portion of the right of way
and reaching th'a city. All wires are
down east of Redlands Junction.
At railroad headquarters in Colton
It was stated that a mile and a half
of track was Washed out near Beau
jrxont-and a mile more near Hinda.
TJhe water carried quantities of rail
road ties that were piled along the
right- of way upon the track and
heaped them high with mud and de
bris. ' Railroad men say that the
cloudburst was the worst they have
ever encountered.
The passengers on the train, who
have, been practically imprisoned in
the cars for nearly a week by the
washouts In Arizona, were almost
p.inic-stricken by the appearance of
the flood waters again to-day.

The suit of Thomas H. Rooney
against the estate of Charles Fair for
J73.Q00 for services alleged to have
been rendered as a mining expert was
answered yesterday by Hermann Oel
richs, administrator of the estate, who
denied every allegation In Rooney's
complaint excepting that In passing
upon the bills of the creditors the
Kooney claim had been turned down
by the administrator. Rooney's claim
set forth that he had been employed
as a mining expert by Charles Fair to
pass upon properties In Mexico, Ari
zona, Nevada and California and in
settling the controversy over the own
ership of the Morgan mine between
Fair and -"William Irvine. In his suit
for payment Rooney declared that
Charles Fair had promised to make
him general manager of the estate of'
James G. Fair after the litigation over
Â¦ the latter estate was settled, but that
In the meantime Charles Fair had'
gone abroad and met his death wlth-
out fulfilling his contract. These con
tentions are denied in toto by Oelrichs. .

"The company has also acaulred an
other auarter section of land on 12-11
21, making three quarter sections
now owned by the Grand. A quarter
section on section 8 adjoining this last
has been secured by a company of
Wisconsin capitalists, who are expect
ed to undertake some development
work. These properties are within two
miles of the oil spring."
The Sonora Independent, speaking of
the Sell mine in Tuolumne County, re
ports:
"We were shown Monday an exceed
ingly handsome specimen of gold and
quartz all sprinkled over with a tellu
ride of gold. At a rough guess there
was probably $200 in the rock, besides i
a small sack containing more, but not
bo rich, that was found at the same
time. We are pleased that Divoll &
Fulcher are getting on to the % yellow
metal again. They deserve all they
get for their perseverance in their con
tinual development of the mine. The
present find may result in a good-sized
pocket, for when a vein throws out
such golden ore as we have seen the
end is not yet."
The following item is taken from the
Jackson Ledger:
"At the Wide Awake mine, which is
in Railroad Flat mining district, Cala
veras County, a peculiar state of affairs
Is presented. The ore assays $10 and $11
per ton, but several milling tests have
proved unavailing In saving more than
from 50 cents to $1 per ton. The tail
ings show gold value of about $10. If
any methqd can be devised to save a
fair percentage of the gold the prop
erty may be made a remunerative one.
The rock Is not evidently of the free
milling character. George I. Wright
has had an expert from San Francisco
visit the mine recently, an experienced
assayer and mineralogist, who after a
thorough examination gave it aa his
opinion that the ore might be .treated
by the cyanide process. The manage
ment has decided to fix up a small
plant to test this treatment. An as
sessment of one cent per share has been
levied for this purpose. The ore differs
materially In character from o.ther gold
ores in that vicinity. There is little
doubt some method can be devised to
recover the gold. The problem may
take a little time and involve consid
erable experimenting to solve."
"H. Pennlngton, general manager of
the Grand Oil Company, who has just
returned from the East, says that his
company is going to proceed to drill
on its well on 34-12-21 in East Sunset.
It is also preparing the ground for a
reservoir. The company has not yet
struck oil In paying quantities, but it
has the best indications and during a
lull in the drilling operations Mr. Pen
nington decided to utilize his men in
reservoir work, being confident that he
will have use for the oil receptacle
later.

The Mount Vernon mine at the top

CONCERNING OIL PROSPECTS.
The Bakersfield Callfornian says of
the oil prospects in the Grand prop
erty:
In many instances this is being done.
A company owning a large property de
velops that property, through a tunnel
started on the claim of another ad
joining the company's mine. There
have been many, lawsuits as a result,
but now that the case has finally been
decided there may be an end to the
trouble in that direction.
The Angels Echo says that work Is
going on in the famous old , Utlca
mine. That journal continues: "Super
intendent Shinn had doubts as to thÂ«Â»
mine being worked out, and to satisfy
himself he caused a drift to be run
from level 2 of the South Stickle mine
to and beneath the Utlca underground
works.
"Here, at a point 200 feet below the
present bottom of. -the Utlca north
shaft, the lode of the Utlca has again
been discovered, being over thirty feet
in width and tending to increase in
width as it descends into the earth.
The ore is of the same character as
that found In the upper levels of the
old works and is equally valuable.
"The discovery demonstrates the
fact that the Utlca is far from being
worked out and that it is as good a
mine as it. ever has been in the past.
"Owing to. the bad condition of the
ground the Utica lode will be mined
by way of the - lower levels of the
South Stickle, from which, point the
discovery drift has been run. '!

The United States Supreme Court has
just handed down a decision that is bf
great importance to miners and mine
owners and will possibly forever settle
a question that has long been open
and one that has brought about many
lawsuits.
The Federal court decides that the
owner of a mine cannot run a tunnel
through an adjoining mine to reach
his own property without the consent
of the owners of the adjoining claim.
This case was take*h up from Mon

past few months was closed last week
by the H. Fletcher Company, who sold
for the Davis brothers to A. H. Butler
of San Francisco the seven claims ad
joining the Red Rock, Denver and the
McKane & Schwab properties for a
consideration of $50,000. Mr. Butler, the
purchaser, is a well-known capitalist of
San Francisco and is president of the
Dabney Oil Company and the Califor
nia and Oriental Steamship Company,
and is also well known in mining and
financial circles on the coast. A new
company will shortly be incorporated,
to be known as the West Tonopah Min
ing Company, with a capital of $1,000,
000, and active development of the
mines will be pushed. The present work
on the claims consists of a sixty-foot
shaft, and from this float assaying from
$80 to $1400 per ton has -been taken.
The general impression of the camp is
that these claims are among the best in
Tonopah, and lying as they do in the
highly mineralized defined zone they
should prove large producers. While
the company's plans are not yet defi
nitely determined, it has been prac
tically decided that development will
be on a large scale and that the most
modern machinery will be introduced
in working the mine.
The reason for Charles Kornfeld be
queathing 560,000 to Annie T. Smith
in his will and leaving the remainder
of his large estate to his widow, Vir
ginia Kornfeld, is explained in the an
swer filed in court yesterday to the
contest of the will commenced by the
attorney of Joseph Guzik of Warsaw,
Russia, nephew of Kornfeld.. The an
swer is filed by Attorneys Lloyd &
Wood for the widow, Virginia; Annie
Smith, R. H. Lloyd and the other
beneficiaries under the will. Lacking
information or belief, the answerers
deny the relationship claimed by
Guzik of Warsaw', and deny that one
Fibusz Guzik of the same city is a
brother of Kornfeld. They deny that
Kornfeld was 80 years old when he
made his will, as alleged, but 78, and
that the was not of unsound mind.
It is admitted that Annie T. Smith
was not a relative of Kornfeld, but
in that regard it is explained that the
woman who received a bequest of
SCO, 000 was a relative of Mrs. Korn
feld and had lived in the family from
the time she was 12 years old and for
twenty-nine years thereafter. Korn
feld and his wife, It is declared, nur
tured and educated the girl and cared
for her as though she had been their
own daughter. She had always been
loving and obedient and strong bond3
of love, affection and sympathy existed
between her and deceased, says the
answer.

"The driller has been at work for sev
eral days on the fifth well, and Thurs
day, at a depth of about 125 feet struck
the gas. The new well is the best.pro
ducer in the field, yielding about 15,000
feet of gas per day. As the company
has already on hand a surplus of 10,000
feet it is now certain that enough can
be obtained to supply Oxnard and in
termediate points. Material for piping
the gas to Oxnard and supplying that
town has already been ordered, and as
soon as it arrives men will be set to
work extending the mains. It is possi
ble that with the development of the
wells, the supply being considered in
exhaustible, gas will be piped to Nord
hoff, Saticoy and Santa Paula. The
natural gas Is giving general satisfac
tion in Ventura. It is found cheaper
than wood for fuel and gives intense
heat for all purposes. Several hundred
residences are now equipped with gas
ranges and heaters."
As an increase in the outlet for oil
heavy shipments are being made from
this State to the Hawaiian Islands,
where the fluid is used for fuel on the
large plantations. Several oil steamers
have left for the islands, while one
sailed for St. Michael, Alaska, where
her cargo will be used in the gold dig
gings. (
The Silver State of Winnemucca says
of the big mining deal recently made
at Tonopah:
An enormous flow of natural gas has
been struck in Ventura at the plant of
the Ventura Light and Power Com
pany, which yields 15,000 feet a day.
The Independent says of the new
gusher:
GREAT FIX)\V OF GAS.
"The Union Oil Company is putting
in a new six-inch pipe line between
Graciosa and Harris station. The pres
ent four-inch pipe is inadequate to
handle the output of its Santa Maria
wells."
The Santa Monica Times* speaking of
its section of Santa Barbara County,
says:
"The Union Sugar Company will be
gin drilling for oil on its premises in
the vicinity of the peninsula that ex
isted before the lake dried up. Work
on the rig is under way. Mr. Tolbutt
will have charge of the drill.
"The Western Union Company's test
well is down 3800 feet and the pump
is to be applied to-day. The oil is 35
degrees or better and exists in great
quantity. This is by far the deepest
well in California.
"The Southern Pacific Company has
let a contract to Mr. Stell to go down
another 1000 feet or until oil is reached-
The well is now 2001 feet deep and has
a strong flow of gas. The opinion pre
vails among oil men that a fine well
will be cot.
Oil and natural gas appear to be
holding the center of the mineral stage
at present. Gushers of both the fluid
and the vapor have been coming up
the wells in different localities of
the southern portion, of this
State. It is reported from the Coallnga
oil fields that a few days ago a stream
of oil suddenly burst 100 feet in air
from a well shaft, covering the der
ricks with the fluid. The strike was
made at a depth of 1630 feet and is
expected to yield 1000 barrels a day.
Another gusher is reported in the
oil fields of the Watsonvllle Oil Com
pany at Sargent's ranch, Santa Clara
County. When the oil stratum was
perforated by the drill the tremendous
pressure forced the geyser of oil high
toward the top of the derrick.
Important Decision in Min
ing Litigation- Is Made
by United States Court
Henry Strathmann was arrested for
being: drunk on Natoma street on Fri
day night by Policeman McEntee and
yesterday he was booked at the City
Prison on charges of failure to provide
and battery. ThjÂ» complaints were
sworn to before Police Judge Cabaniss
by Mrs. -Rachel Stone on the first
charge and by Strathmann's wife, Jo-
S sephine, on the second. Secretary
[White of the California Society for
j the Prevention of Cruelty to Children
I is looking after Mrs. Strathmann's in
j terests.
; Strathmann at one time had a sa
! loon on Beale street and later was a
! partner with his wife's brother, Gert
Schomaker, at 600 O'Farrell street, in
the grocery and saloon business. He
sold his half interest to his brother-in
law on June 8, but his wife claims
that he still retains his half interest.
She also asserts that her husband has
transferred his right to property he
owns in this city to his brother-in-law
I with the object of preventing her from
! enjoying any benefit from it.
j Mrs. Strathmann says that ever
j since her marriage her husband has
1 not supported her properly and has
j treated her cruelly. Just before the
i birth of her baby, now two months
old, he refused to call in a physician
and she had to hire a wagon to take
Â¦ her to the City and County Hospital,
j where her baby was born. A week
ago last Friday he gave her 50 cents
{ and she said that was the only money
i she had received from him for over a
month. She had been compelled to
! sell part of the furniture for food.
She went to the house of a friend at
Hunters Point for help in her desti
tute condition. On Friday night
j Strathmann called there and, she al
leges, attacked her viciously. He
choked and beat her and when Mrs.
Stone interfered to protect her she
was also beaten. In his blind fury he
struck the baby on the head and near
ly killed it. It was after attacking
his wife that he was arrested on Na
toma -street for being drunk.
- When Secretary White called upon
I Strathmann after his wife had put her
i case in his hands Strathmann boast
j ingly told White that he was heir to
I a large estate in Germany. He de
i clined to support his wife and babe.

were not asked for the findings of the
autopsy, so. they did not deem It their
duty to send the result of the autopsy
to the police officials.
. The autopsy was performed on the
night of the murder and it was not
until yesterday, when the Coroner's
inquest was held,. that the startling de
velopment that the man was killed
with a bullet from a 38-caliber pistol
was made.
The police were assisted in the se
curing of the pistol by which the mur
der was committed by a young man,
whose name they refuse to divulge.
This party loaned Murphy the. cart
ridges with which the 3S-callber re
volver was loaded. Murphy filled the
chambers of the pistol in his pres
ence'and then placed the revolver un
der the seat of the wagon by the side
of the 44-caliber revolver, where it
was secured by Scherf and used in his
dastardly crime.
Captain of Detectives Martin and
the . District Attorney are much in
censed at the action of the Coroner's
employes in not making them cog
nizant of the fact that the bullet dis
covered was of 38 caliber. The men

Martin, District Attorney Bylngton,
Detective Cody and Sergeant Lewis.
The investigation will be,, continued
this morning.
| District Attorney Byington said last
night that the two men could be
charged with concealing evidence,
which is a misdemeanor, This course
will undoubtedly be pursued .by the
police after they feel that they have
learned everything the two young'
men know. .;
At the investigation last night, when
they learned Qf Murphy's attempt to
conceal the most importait piece- of
evidence . in the case, - the deputy
rcundman was at first loth to answer
any questions. He assumed a haughty
and hurt air, but toward the end of
the questioning he was crying like a
child and telling apparently all that
he knew.
Murphy and Welntraut were sub
jected to a vigorous firs of questions

Sergeant Lewis late last night to his

police found Murphy said that before
the murder took place he had shot at a
eea gull as they were driving on the
boundaries of Islais Creek.
When the pound wagon returned to
the pound on the night of the murder
the Back containing the dog meat,
which was daily collected by. the men
on the wagon for feeding the impound
ed animals, was emptied by one of the
attaches of the pound yard. He failed
to notice the revolver. The next day
Murphy went to the pound, secured
the weapon, unloaded it and took it to
his home.
The longest railroad In this coultry
is the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy,
which owns 7794 miles and operates
7971 miles.
Directly after the killing, when the
. three men were madly driving away
from the Bcene of the crime, they con
cealed the 28-caliber weapon in a sack
rot > dog meat which was In the
bottom of the wagon. When the police
caught Weintraut and Murphy driving
in the* wagon with Ford, who was sub
stituted as driver after the flight of
Hcherf, only one revolver was found. It

is, flndlng that one of the chambers
v.as empty, naturally concluded that he
had found the weapon ' that caused
Schultze'g death.
In explanation of the absence of one
deputy poundkeepers, who were with
?-cherf at the time of the murder, were
/ arrested last nlsht and their names
placed on the detinue book. Murphy
explained that there had been two pis
tols on the wagon at the time of the
murder, -one a 2S-ca!iber and the other
a 44-caliber revolver.

Dr. Hassler stated that since 1903
more than $40,000 has been spent in
cleaning Chinatown. He said that six
months had passed and not a case of
contagion was fyund. He advised
greater care during the coming
months because of;-the arrival of hun
dreds of Chinese 'from the northern
fisheries. Surgeori Cumming of the
Federal quarantine service announced
that every boat would be examined
and the baggage fumigated. A cen
sus of all arrivals will also be taken.
The Merchants' Association was
tendered a vote of thanks for its cour
tesy in voting a sum of money for the
Public Health Commission.
On motion of Dr. James W. Ward,
president of the local Board of Health,
a committee was appointed to investi
gate the private crematories with a
view of stopping the burning of gar
bage. President Rupert Blue, M. D.,
appointed Drs. Hassler, O'Neil, Trot
ter and Currie and directed them to
report at the next meeting.
Secretary Louis I^evy was directed
to write to Washington and gather
data about the proposed national lep
ersarium to be placed on the island of
Molokai, Hawaiian Islands. The Ha
waalan Government desires the United
States to relieve it from paying for
the care of the unfortunates on the
island of. Molokai and has asked the
Public Health Commission to assist it
in securing necessary funds.
It developed during the reports of
the medical inspectors in Chinatown
that the rats of thjit district were fast
disappearing by reason of the poison
being spread over that quarter. One
inspector created surprise when he
stated that the rats were growing fat
on the poisoned corn meal. Orders
were issued to change the rodents'
diet to phosphorlzed cheese.
At a meeting of the Public Health
Commission of California, held yes
terday in the rooms of the United
States Public Health and Marine Hos
pital Service, A. Sbarboro, a member
of the organization, called attention to
the fact that private corporations
were burning garbage in San Fran
cisco, despite the fact that there was
an ordinance in effect that requires
all garbage to be sent to the reduction
works. He stated that the garbage
men are supposedly bringing paper to
private crematoria?, but inside the pa
per* is garbage of every .description.
Dr. Hassler, â¢ chief inspecting physi
cian of the Board of Health, stated
that as many as forty arrests a month
had been made, but in almost every
instance the Police Judges had al
lowed the guilty persons to go with a
nominal fine or a reprimand.

A mother of a Inrge family, especially
the mother who does her own nursing,
looking after her children, dressing
them, sotting them rfady for school,
nursing them when pick, and at the same
time attending to her household duties â
such a woman is heavily burdened, and
most of them break down under the
"strain. When I went to the Electro-
<Jhemic Institute for treatment I felt that
I was about worn out. Medical treat-
ment did not reach my trouble. My
Mood was weak. My h^-art was weak,
:ny circulation was poor. I had no ap-
Itetitt- and the little food I did eat gave
mÂ« no strength. I had a severe pain in
mv ba<-k and also ii|*the lower abdomen.
My liver and l>owÂ«-l!^jfrould not art at all
ar.ci I had catarrh very badly. I was
lired of swallowing medu-ines that did
mo no good, ar.d as the Elect ro-Chemic
tieatm^nt was highly recommended to me
1 decided to take it. and like no many
others I nm plnd ihat I did so. I have
decided to publicly recommend it to
Others, especially to the suffering ,wo-
mÂ«-n who. like I was, are worn out.
My name is Mrs. Lila Kelson and I
live at I'Sil* Otis street. Berkeley. Any
one who would like to know more about
tnv successful treatment by Klectro-
Ohemistry is at liberty to call upon me.
Here is another name added to the
long list of wonderful cures by Electro-
Chemistry in serious diseases of women.
FW tro-Chemistry restores health and
ptrength to wornont women, no matter
what rray have caused the decline. It
does- so because every org-an ln the body
4 .f sir*-npthened. Every organ is made to
<\'< itn work normally. The blood is pu-
rified aiid built up by the oxygen that is
placed into it. nnd the wonderful effects
of Elcctro-Chemistry are *}uick and per-
manent and the expense H little. Con-
sultation and examination is free to all
B'jfferers. This flee Electro-Chemic X-
Rav Examination is the most reliable
that any sufferer, man or woman, can
hav*Â»rfiTiait is as free, as air to all. The
fume of the Klectro-Chcmic Institute of
San Francisco is spreading. These r< Â»:
marlcable c.;res are talked of all over the
\Ve*t.
Two patients from Illinois were dis-
charged last week perfect!}- cured, and
hith are now at home well" and happy.
One was cured of a serious catarrh of
the lungs, called consumption by the pa-
tient's home physician, and the other
cas* was deafne-pn and ear noises.
In a short time the testimonial of a
r'U'sScian from Mississippi, cured of
cancer, will be published. Very soon the
testimonial of a well-known San Fran-
<!sco lady, who hsd bÂ»en told that she
had galloping consumption, will be pub-
lished. Cured by Electro-Chemistry
<j'j?Â«.-kly and cheaply.
There ?re hundreds of sufferers, living
in the country, who should take advan-
tage of the low railroad rates for the
Knights Templar Conclave, to come for
a free, personal Electro-Chemic X-Ray
Examination.
The majority of such patients can re-
turn home the same day, taking the
home course of Electro-Chemistry with
them, if they desire to do po. The Elec-
tro-Chemic treatment is the most suc-
cessful, the latest and most scientific
treatment in Consumption, Catarrh.

"The latter features of the decree
were unassailable. No cause has been
shown and no power exists, in my
opinion, to set aside such provisions,
for while the court erred in absolutely
divorcing these parties it did not err
in making: the provisions last referred
to. In the latter respect the judgment
is, in my opinion, good.
"The motion, therefore, addressed,
as it is. to the decree as ' ari entirety,
must be denied and it is so ordered."
The twentieth session of the Grand
Council of the Pacific jurisdiction of the
Young Men's Institute, that closed with
the entertainment and reception ten
dered the grand officers and delegates at
the Alhambra Theater Friday evening,
was one of the most successful and
profitable sessions ever held. The citi
zens of Crockett and of the county seat,
Martinez, extended every courtesy to
their guests of the week, and those who
v. ere in attendance will long remember
the open-handed hospitality shown
them at every hand.
The Grand Council was opened with
the celebration of solemn high mass at
St. Rose's Church, Rev. Benedict Me-
Govern celebrant. Archbishop George
Montgomery and Rev. W. R. Thompson
present in the sanctuary. The Arch
bishop addressed the members of the
Grand Council, speaking in praise of
the purpose and work of the society
and lending encouragement to all Inter
ested in its advancement. The address
throughout was most forceful and
made an impression -that will not soon
be effaced. Special music was rendered
by a select choir, and in this particular,
as in all others, the thorough arrange
ments of the committee in charge was
evidenced.
The business session was opened in
the early afternoon, and the grand
president, James D. Whalen, who pre
sided throughout the convention, ap
pointed the following committee on cre
dentials: J. J. Callaghan, H. C. Vosta,
L. F. Guedet, J. F. McNally and James
Ahern. The commute at once filed its
report and those entitled to seats were
admitted. Thereupon the reports of all
officers and standing committees were
ordered referred to the proper commit
tees for consideration" and report to the
Grand Council.
Following are the committees named:
Financeâ J. P. Fitzgerald. W. J. Hamil
ton, J. J. Burke, L. E. Mahan and Dr.
T. H. Morris; pressâ R. A. Miller, W. V.

VANCOUVER. B. C, Aug. 27.âRu
mors cf serious forest fires at logging
camps up the coast were being circu
lated on the streets this afternoon. Ac
cording to some of the reports four
persons were burned to death and
many thousand dollars' worth of shin
gle bolts were destroyed. Up to a late
hour it was impossible to verify the re
ports, which may have been exagger
ated, but the fact that there was a bi^
fire at Kanimura's logging camp on
Howe Sound was confirmed.
The fire at which the fatalities are
reported to have occurred is said tn
have taken place last nisrht at a camp
on Gambier Island owned by a JapaaÂ«
est? named Tom Aoki.
The fire swept around the camp s^Â»
suddenly that the residents were driven
to the water by the flames. Two men,
one woman and a child, all Japanese,
are reported to have perished in th?
fire. The remaining workers at the
camp made their escape by raÂ»ans of
boats.

FINISH WORK
AT CROCKETT
M. D. Slattery, D. T. Powers and James
Gallagher. R. A. Miller was appointed
assistant grand secretary.
The report of the grand president.
James D. Whalen, was read and re
ferred to committees on law and super
vision and state of the institute for re
port upon recommendations therein
contained. The proposed holding of bi
ennial sessions was considered and by
almost unanimous vote defeated.
The session of the second day had to
deal with matters of proposed amend
ments and the Introduction of resolu
tions, following which an early ad
journment was taken to enjoy the bay
and river excursion.
The third day's session had for con
sideration important legislation con
cerning the office of organizer and con
sideration of the report as to the new
ritual, and close attention on the part
of the delegates resulted in the adop
tion of amendments which permitted
this important work to be carried to a
conclusion thus early in the session. C.
M. "Waage of Ignatian Council No. 35.
San Francisco, the author of the pro
posed ritual, was present and was*
heartily received by the delegates. Thi3
matter having received approval at the
hands of this Jurisdiction will be re
ferred now to the Supreme Council,
which convenes at Colorado Springs
October 10. frr final action.
The report of the committee on state
of the institute was read and its recom
mendations as to management of funds
of subordinate councils, organizers,
continuance of the Institute Journal,
annual sessions and the adoption of the
ritual were approved and the report
adopted by the Grand Council.
Before adjournment was had motion
was made and carried by rising vote
that when the Grand Council do ad
journ it adjourn out of respect to the
memory of Peter J. Dunne of Ignatian
Council No. 35.
Thursday was set aside as the time
for the election of grand officers, and
this was taken up as the first order of
tHe day. The elections resulted as fol
lows: Supreme delegatesâ Samuel Has
iflns, L. E. Mahan, W. J. Hennessey
and Herman Berg; supreme alternates
â F. J. Kierce. E. R. Myrick. Dr. T. H.

laghan and James C. Hanley.
The social life of the Grand Council ses
sion opened with the entertainment in
honor of the delegates on Monday even
ing, and it was largely attended and en
joyed by all. Tuesday the bay excursion
was perhaps the most pleasant event
of the session, and the trip to Mare
Island and about the bay, concluding
with the visit to Martinez, where the
visitors were received by the county of
nclalus and extended a hearty welcome,
made doubly glad in the distribution of
baskets of the fruits grown in the coun
ty at the^ands of the fair daughters
of the city. That evening a reception
by the ladies of Crockett was enjoyed,
and the grand ball of Wednesday even
ins w as a gala affair. The banquet on
was undoubtedly to discourage divorces
â it was designed to. protect and con
serve the marital relation and to forbid
an absolute decree of divorce until at
least one year after the entry of the
interlocutory decree.
"The State is concerned in the main
tenance of the marital relation and is
vitally interested in divorce proceed
ings, hence the Legislature may deter
mine, not only the conditions upon
which marriages may be entered upon,
but also the conditions upon which such
marriages may be dissolved.
" "The rule of public policy relating to
marriage is to foster and protect it, and
to prevent separations and illicit un
ions.' hence actions for divorce are
hedged about with provision? and stat
utory regulations peculiar only to such
litigation.
DECREE IS VOID.
"Such being the policy of the law
It seems to me that the decree In ques
tion was void. To hold that it was
merely voidable is to defeat the pur
pose and intent of the act and to de
termine that cither of the divorced
spouses could marry again upon the
expiration of the period of six months
from the date of the entry of the in
terlocutory decree; for, if the offending
party should elect not to move for a
new trial or appeal rrom the decree
within such statutory period, then the
decree, if voidable only, became final,
and thereafter either of the spouses
could marrv acain before the expira
tion of the year, the statutory provision
to the contrary notwithstanding.
"Some authorities hold that the Judg
ment of a court of general jurisdiction
is rot void unless the fatal infirmity
appear upon its face. Tested by thi3
rule the decree herein is void because
its recitals show that the action was
tried on the 23d of June, 1903, and the
decree made and entered eight days
thereafter.
SEIUOL'S CONSEQUENCES.
The construction here adopted J3
fraught with serious consequences, af
fecting, as it may, the validity of sub
sequent marriages, the possible legiti
macy of Issue, and the right of suc
cession in the event of the death of
either spouse within the period of one
year; but the act plainly contemplates
such consequences, for it expressly pro
vides that only upon the expiration of
the period of one year after the entry
of the interlocutory decree can the
court enter the final decVee 'which shall
restore to the parties the status of
single persons, and permit either party
to marry.'
"The act further provides that a
marriage contracted subsequently to
the entry of the interlocutory decree,
but before the time when the court
may enter final judgment, 'shall not be
thereby validated nor constitute a de
fense upon a criminal prosecution.' The
act being thus plain in its provisions
and free from constitutional objections,
it is the duty of the court to enforce it.
"The motion made herein, however,
cannot be granted because it seeks to
get aside the entire decree. Now, a
Judgment may be good in part and
bad in part. In the present case the
court undoubtedly had Jurisdiction of
the subject matter and of the parties.
The complaint alleged the marriage,
the birth of issue and the possession
of community property and contained
the usual prayer. The decree, after di
vorcing the parties, made provision for
the apportionment of the community
property, awarded, plaintiff a sum of
money, assigned to her a certain in-
"fraught with serious consequences, 1 *
but "It Is the duty of the court to en
force It."
THE OPINION.
The opinion in full follows:
"On the second day of March, 1903.
the Legislature adopted an act pro
viding that In actions of divorce. If
divorce is denied, final Judgment must
thereupon be entered; but if the court
determines that cause is shown for a
divorce then an interlocutory* decree
must be entered, declaring that the in
nocent party is entitled to such a di
vorce. From such interlocutory de
cree an appeal may be taken within
six months after its entry. Upon the
expiration of one year after such en
try, if no appeal Is taken therefrom or
no motion for new trial made, the
court may "enter final judgment,
granting a divorce; and such final
judgment shall restore the parties to
the status of single persons and permit
either party to marry after entry
thereof." In the event of an appeal
from the Judgroent or motion for new
trial the judgment cannot be entered
until the motion or appeal has been
finally determined â and not then if the
motion is granted or the judgment re
versed.
"The act further provided that the
death of either party after the entry
of the interlocutory decree and before
the final decree should not affect the
court's power to enter final judgment
thereon; 'but such entry shall not vali
date any marriage contracted by either
party before the entry of such final
judgment, nor constitute any defense
of any criminal . prosecution made
against either.'
"Subsequent to the adoption of this
act the plaintiff commenced this action
against her husband to obtain a di
divorce, for the custody of the children
of the marriage and for a division of
the community property. The defend
ant in due time answered, the cause
was tried and on the 1st day of July,
1903, the court granted the plaintiff an
absolute decree of divorce.

"It seems that after the adoption of
the act in question some of the Judges
of the Superior Court of this county
and of other counties, regarding the act
as unconstitutional, did not follow its
provisions, and when a cause of action
was established they granted the inno
cent party an absolute instead of an in
terlocutory decree of divorce. Subse
quently, in October, 1903, the Supreme
Court decided that the act in question
eras valid and constitutional. After that
decision a motion for a new trial was
made herein by the plaintiff, but the
motion was subsequently dismissed. On
the last day of the six months allowed
for an appeal from the said decree
plaintiff appealed therefrom, but fail-
Ing to prosecute her appeal it was dis
missed. The plaintiff now moves the
court to svt aside and vacate the en
tire decree.
"The Question thus presented is. is
the decree in question void or voidable?
This question is as important as it is
difficult of determination. The im,port
ance of the distinction rests in the fact
that if the decre is void it is a nullity.
A void judgment is of no legal effect,
it dettrmines nothing and binds no one;
it can neither impair nor create a right,
nor need it be assailed, either by mo
tion or upon appeal. Whenever it is
invoked against a party he may im
peach it and show its worthlessness.
As one writer has expressed it, 'it is a
dead limb upon the judicial tree.'
A VOIDABLE JUDGMENT.
"A voidable judgment, however, is an
erroneous judgment; it is one in which
an error has been committed by the
court in determining some question
properly before it. Such a judgment
may be subsequently set aside upon
motion, or reversed upon appeal. But if
no appeal therefrom is taken or no mo
tion made it becomes in all respects a
va!id judgment, and as good to all in
tents and purposes as if it were free
from error.
"The right to assail the decree in
question, either upon motion for new
trial or upon appeal, is gone: therefore
if the decree is void the parties herein
are still husband and wife; if it is sim
ply erroneous, it is now valid, and the
marital relation no longer exists be
tween them.
"The purpose of the act in question
â¢ Jf Superior Judge Hunt's opinion ia
tb* case of Grannis agrainEt Grannla is
held good by the Supreme Court, a
few hundred people now married will
have to figure on lepai proceeding* and
a new ceremony to make their union
'legral; children born of such marriages
Â«111 have to temporarily relinquish
their claims to legitimacy and estates
involved in the complexities created
may be thrown into lepaJ chaos. In thÂ«s
Grannis case. Judpre Hunt was prevent
ed from petting aside all of Judge Sloss"
decree on account of technical ques
tions of Hide issues and jurisdiction,
tut in netting: forth the law in the mat
ter the court makes it plain that in his
opinion many of the absolute decrees
prantM after the passage of the inter
locutory decree law are invalid.
During the period when some of the
Superior Judges throughout the State
believed that the interlocutory law
would be found unconstitutional, ab
solute decrees were granted. In some
of the cases, either the rear* or woman
hÂ£s s!nce married again and children
have been born. ?uch cases will be af-
J^cted by the decision.
It v,as susreested by Judge Hunt
yesterday that there is a remedy for
the mistake, in that persons "who were
Framed absolute decrees have yet the
right to appear and have th*Â» decree
â¢ harmed into an interlocutory and re
marry at the end of the prescribed
twelve months.
In the Ura&nfs case Judge Slo?s
granted an absolute decree of divorce
â¢s.ftei the passage of the law providing
for ir.teriocutory decrees and before
the constitutionality of the latter act
had been sustained by the Supreme
ourt. At the tine Mr?. Grannis was
awarded EI2D9. to be paid by her hus=
band in iiFtalhiirrsts of 5ifw> a month,
and StSOO inore in realty. Phe later
became AbseatisSed vith the award
end Â«nueht to have the decree annulled
en t'te srrcur.d that it was absolute in
ftea<i of interlocutory. She appeale-1
t<- the Supreme Court within the al
totted Â«ix nmr.ths, but failed to pros
â¬â¢> utv tilt appeal, and this was one of
the technicalities which prevented
J'^dge Hunt from acting in her favor
tvhen sh<? applied to him to have the
whole decree set aside.
The important point iu Judge Hunt's
opinion is In tNÂ» words: "Such beinir
tr>Â» j.olicy of the law, it seems to me
that the decree in question was void."
This construction of the law is

police, was to-day sent to an asylum.
When arraigned on the charge the
woman arose and dramatically took the
case into her own hands. She con
ducted her defense on the ground that
her name was not Marcia Burrows
and that the real Marcia named In the
Indictment was another person. In a
cross-examination by physicians she
frequently used the expression, "When
you made an examination of this
woman," etc.
In her speech to the Judge the
woman Was furious' in her criticisms
of the authorities. She refused to tes
tify in her own behalf and was
promptly j committed to the asylum. v

INSANE WOMAN ACTS
AS HER OWN ATTORNEY
C.'W. Killion, chief of the university
police, sought to have the charge of
felony for violating the State law re
garding tampering with electric wires
placed against the young men this aft
ernoon, but Justice Edgar refused it on
the ground of insufficient evidence. The
attempt to have the students charged
with a felony is said to have been In
spired by Professor C. L. Cory, chair
man of the students' affairs committee,
from whom Killion holds a wrftten re
quest for the additional charge.
By agreeing to investigate the con
duct of the police of the University of
California for arresting four students
on the campus last night with the aid
of pistols, handcuffs and other stern
persuaders, President Wheeler to-day
helped the cause of the students ma
terially. President Wheeler is satisfied
from what he has heard that the action
of the police was hardly justifiable.
Wheeler was Interviewed to-day by-
Harry Dehm, president of the Asso
ciated Students, who laid all the facts
of the midnight arrest before him.
Dehm told the president that the ac
cused youths had not been connected
with the stringing of vthe sign on the
university grounds any more than to
look at it after it was up. This offense
did not call for a flourish of pistols and
a clamping of handcuffs, he said, and
Wheeler agreed with him. Wheeler
said that he could see no objection to
stringing the banner, as no property
had been destroyed, and that If the
students had asked his permission to
do so they would have had it.
Three of the arrested students, Fe
lipe Buencamino, Clair Gordon and
H. W. Schrelber, appeared in Justice
Edgar's court this morning for arraign
ment. As no complaint had been lodged
against them, however, they were not
asked to plead. Justice Edgar- said
that if no complaint was filed by Tues
day he would dismiss the- youths. D.
W. Taylor, the other arrested student,
did not appear in court .having gone
to consult with his father in San An
sel mo. J;:-^ '

PORTLAND, Ore.. Aug. 27.â The sev
enth annual session of the American
Mining Congress was closed at noon to
day after having elected a board of di
rectors which convened Immediately
thereafter and elected Its officers with
the exception of secretary.
To-day's session was devoted to rou
tine business, concluding the work of
acting upon resolutions reported back
by the committee, and various mem
bers of the association were heard in
short addresses on various topics. A
general resolution of thanks was ex
tended to those who had participated
In making the session a success. The
sentiment echoed from former reso
lutions thanking the administration at
Washington for Its Interest in the de
velopment of the mining industry, as
indicated by sending government offi
cials to the congress, was included.
President Richards in the course of
an address assured the congress that
the organization has reached the point
in its history where it passes from the
uncertainty of delegate-representation
of which it originally consisted to a
membership organization that adopts a
strict system of business conduct. The
financial report was submitted and
showed a good cash balance In the
treasury.
There were splendid ovations' to
President Richards and Secretary
Mahon, evincing the confidence that
has been felt in their work.
The following directors were elected
for the ensuing year:
J. H. Richards, Idaho; Thomas E.
"Wing. California; E. R. Buckley, Misr
Bouri; A. "W. Gifford, Texas; John
Dem, Utah; William Lennox, Colorado:

ALAMEDA, Aus. 27. â The days of
the volunteer fire department of this
city are numbered and in a very short
time a paid department will be in
stalled. â¢ A report to this effect was
submitted last night by Trustee* Dr.
H. M. Pond. The recommendation
was called forth by an ihvestlaratlon
made by the Boar<J of Trustees of a
recent fire in Sherman street.
Trustees Decide That Volunteer Ser
\lcc No Longer Affords Ade
.' qnate Protection.
AIiASlEDA SOOX TO HAVE
PAID FIRE DEPARTMENT
"We agree with a majority of our
people that the racing wheelmen on
Sunday should dress in more refined
taste. It has always been a very un
pleasant sight to us and we believe
the matter should be regulated and
the rights of the people respected.
"It is undoubtedly very offensive to
many people and it seems to us that
a regulation costume could be pur
chased' that would work Just as well
and not shock the young people who
are on their way to church or home
ward bound."
The costume that has given such
offense exposes the arms and legs of
the riders to about the same extent
as a bathing suit and it Is Contended
by cyclists that It Is the regulation
suit recognized, all over the country
and used at all race meets, where
thousands of women congregate to
see the races.
OAKLAND, Aug. 27. â The exposure
of brawn and muscle exhibited by
racing bicyclists in the neighborhood
of Haywards has shocked the Puritan
taste of some of the citizens of that
town and a petition has been present
ed to the Board of Trustees In part as
follows:
Citizens of Haywards Object to Cos
tumes of Wheelmen and Petition
for Ordinance Regulating Them.

Hanging lifeless by a cord tied to
his bedpost Hans Remien. a gardener,
57 years of age, was found this morn
ing in his room at 822 Linden street.
No message was left for his relatives
to tell them of the somber thoughts
that disquieted his last days. He
went to work as usual yesterday
morning and returned last night with
out an intimation that he had any
thing unusual in contemplation.
When the body was discovered this
morning it was stiff and cold and life
had been extinct for many hours.
Remien had tied a_ piece of clothes
line to his bed post and at the other
end he made a noose, which he put
around his neck and Q then allowed
his weight to hang on the cord. Death
was caused by strangulation.
He leaves a brother living at 1015
Seventh street and a sister in San
Francisco. He was not In financial
need, as he had about $1000 in .bank.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, Aug. 27.
The first Btep toward an organized
campaign for improvement bonds was
taken to-day, when the campaign com
mittee of the Progress Federation of
Oakland formulated plans for the es
tablishment of a city central headquar
ters and the appointment of sub-com
mittees in each ward of the city. It
was decided that the campaign com
mittee, which Is composed of seve'n
members, one from each ward, shall
act as a central committee, whose duty
it shall be to secure speakers for all
bond meetings held under the direction
of the various ward committees.
The ward committees will be com
posed of three members each, who will
be chosen, as far as possible, from
among the officers of the various im
provement organizations, and upon
these sub-committees will devolve the
work of securing halls and arranging
meetings In the different wards. It is
purposed to hold these bond meetings
in each of the wards In turn In order
that practically the same speakers may
deliver addresses in all parts of the
city.
The first meeting under the auspices
of the campaign committee will be held
next Thursday evening. H. B. Belden,
chairman of the committee, received a
communication to-day from Council
man John L. Howard, who said that he
had prepared a paper on "Bond Pro
jects" which he would read at the meet-
Ing.
The campaign committee met this
afternoon at the office of H. B. Belden,
chairman of the committee. The mem
bers of the Progress Federation bond,
campaign committee, which will here
after be known as the city central com
mittee, are H. B. Belden, George Sam
uels, J. C. Bullock, P. M. Fisher, J. C.
Estey, A. V. Feigrht and Edwin Stearns,
secretary of the Board of Trade.

A DEED AND A WORD,
A little stream had lost its way
Amid the grass and fern;
A passing: stranger scooped a well,
Where weary men might turn;
He walled it in, and hungr with cara
. A ladle at the brink;
He thought not "of the deed he did,
But Judged that all might drink.
He passed again, and lo! the well,
By summer never dried,
Had cooled ten thousand parching
tongues,
And saved a life beside.
A r.ameless man. amid a crowd
That thronged the daily mart.

Unstudied, from the heart; â¢ Â¦Â¦-,
A whisper on the tumult thrown,
A transitory breath â 'Â¦- Â¦ .â¢
It raised a brother from the dust,-
It saved a soul from death.

O thought at random cast! ' ~

The startling fact has been developed by Federal inquiry that soldiers
and civilians on board Uncle Sam's transports must buy fit food and adequate
accommodation by bribing petty employes, some of them no more prominent
than waiters. If the authorities are put to the shame of confessing their
inability to suppress such a traffic a movement for a general house-cleaning
in the Government's affairs would be welcomed as timely.
By one of those chances of speculation that make a man a millionaire
in a day it is said that Joaquin Miller has become an oil king. An accidental
discovery of the product upon the poet's land in Texas has worked the
miracle, and now more than ever the old man of the Sierras must fight for
a niche in the poets' corner. A man of money and of verse is too great an
anomaly to be accepted by the credulous even as an accident.
AN aged capitalist in Oakland was rounded up by his relatives, who
asked the Superior Court to endow him and his estate with a guardian
on the ground that he was not sufficiently sane to conduct his own
â¢;:rTa:rÂ£ and his estate was in danger of being dissipated. The sly old gentle
man pretended to acquiesce in this plan as far as the preliminaries were
concerned and then, before the court had acted and named a custodian for
his person and estate, he procured another decree and a guardian in the high
court of Cupid by marrying an able lady of forty-five. While there will be
a difference of opinion as to whether his marriage proves his sanity or not,
there can be no question of the old gentleman's keen appreciation of legal
tactics. Having an able wife by law she is the judge of his capacity and
there is no doubt but his fortune, won in the harmless and necessary pickle
.trade, will .remain in his custody until he disposes of it either by will or'
by throwing it at birds.
The incident is one of many that seem to prove the vigor and splendor
of the Oakland climate. Recently there was announced the coming mar
riage of an aged educator of that city, and there have been a dozen cases
in recent years in which aged Oaklandcrs have pranced up to the altar
dressed in hope and a Prince Albert and pledged themselves boldly to Jove,
honor and obey ladies who have found their mature charms to be quite
irresistible. Oakland is really, by virtue of its climatic and scenic charms, a
sort of clearing-house for Cupid's left-over stock. 'An aged and single gentle
man there knows not the day nor the hour when the subtle influence of his
beautiful surroundings may make him a benedict.
It is an additional argument for voting the bonds and further improving
the eminent handiwork of nature. Make Oakland more beautiful and it
will become the matrimonial mecca for gentlemen who have deferred con
jugal responsibilities and happiness until they are put out of the running
by their juniors in other places and so will resort to the city where old age
fallls off them like a disused garment and they walk with the springy step
of youth and rush into matrimony like the unthinking war horse into battle.

THE State convention of the Republican party at Santa Cruz has ac
complished ii> work and dissolved.
The Democratic convention, which met in the same place a week
before^ had an organization, a machine, if you please^ and that organization
had a programme which went through as far a- men could be found willing
to accept the places to which they were assigned. Present in the Repub
lican convention- al>o. was an organization with a programme. Bui wherever
that programme did not suit the sentiment of the convention it was cast
<i ? ide and entirely independent action was taken.
With politics there must be parties, and with parties there must be or
ganization, and with organization appears the inevitable desire to use its
power to advance personal fortunes. With that no American finds fault. But
Republicans are an independent sort. They treat the organization as the
creature of the party, and not its master, anil the greater party overturns the
lesser organization at will. So it happened at Santa Cruz that in every con
test the wish and will of the party prevailed over the organization, and al
ways with results beneficial to the party, because the wisdom of many is
wiser than the wisdom of the few.
The ticket nominated is strong in all of its parts. There is no weak link
in the chain that binds tlie party to the confidence of the people. The selec
tions were made with the view of making the official representation of the
State solidly Republican by inviting the support of all who have the highest
interests of California closest at heart. It was not such a sad and dispirited
conventicle as the Democratic convention. The flush of confidence and the
conviction of right, the spring of hopefulness and the inspiration of courage,
were upon every delegate and every action of the body from the opening to
the closing fall of the president's gavel. The platform deals with the local
issues important to the people and offers its high indorsement of the whole
record of the party, with nothing to recant, no heresy to expiate and no act
for which to apologize.
The representation was large. Distant counties sent all of their dclc
pates, and the whole body was cleanly and vigorously American. It wasted
no time in its deliberations and no words in its platform in epithet and invec
tive denunciator of the opposition, but was wisely content with direct ex
pression of its own mission and in frank presentation of its own party record
and purpose. This estimate of the convention, its motive and its work, will,
we are persuaded, be accepted as just by every good citizen of California.
We are explicit in presenting this estimate because Mr. Hearst's paper
has cho:?en to libelously lampoon a majority of the citizens as represented in
this convention as corruptionists and bribe takers. It has singled out a United
States Senator and other public men who have wrought long and wisely for
their State and country to characterize them as cringing and sinister and
t-lavish pandcrers, living on the *ale of their honor, and debauchcrs of politics.
Mr. Hears-t, turned down bj' his own party, flouted and cuffed by it in
every precinct in the State where there are enough Democrats to utter them
selves, is the last man to stand as the accuser of his fellow citizens. In his
late campaign for the Presidency in every State that could be bought his
agents were there to purchase with his money the honor of men. The
thriftless and venal, all those whose honor was subject to financial tempta
tion, the law-breaker and the anarchist, marched in his train and under his
banner. The unpurchasable press of his part}', aware of the debauchery,
bribery and corruption by which he, meritless, characterless, lacking in every
qualification for the place, sought the Presidency, took the alarm and begged
of the party, if it must die, to die in the Lord and not perish at the hands
of a hypocritical voluptuary, seeking a new spur to his jaded passions by
treating the Presidency as a woman that may be charmed into infamy by
gewgaws and bought with gauds. The above terms are only quoted from
the Democratic press that knew what he was doing and the danger that
his methods would succeed.
In this State the greatest Democratic paper warned the delegates who
voted for Hearst instructions to be sure and get all that their reputations
were worth, and Hearst's agents and his money turned the convention into
an assignation, where good men were shamed and bad men, shameless, were
willing that their reputations should take on a stench that time will not
disinfect. It is such a man that uses his defeated and discredited newspaper,
the vehicle of his venom, the garbage can of his feculent spite, to attack
and defame the Republican convention and libel and lampoon the chosen
representatives of the party that holds the interests of California higher
the personal ambitions of any man and cherishes the good name of
the State as a good man does that of his mother.
One may well resent and characterize such an attack, be he Republican
or Democrat, provided he is a good American and a loyal citizen of this
gxe?t Slate.

In later years he became a great ad

FRIENDLY TO DIAZ.
An army of more than ten thousand
men are kept constantly employed
upon these ranches and towns of sev
eral thousand population are situated
on the lands. The ranches are all well
fenced and one thousand boundary or
"fence-line" riders are kept constantly
employed.
The land and livestock holdings of
General Terrazas are a comparatively
small part of his wealth. He owns
more than five thousand residences in
the city of Chihuahua, from which he
derives an enormous annual rental In
the aggregate. He also owns business
blocks in Chihuahua and other cities
of Mexico. He owns a controlling in
terest In all of the banks and other
financial Institutions ; of the State of
Chihuahua and has many million dol
lars invested in manufacturing con
cerns in that State.
He has heavy investments in rich
mines and In various other, enterprises
scattered throughout Mexico.
The income from his various prop
erties is so large that he finds it a dif
ficult matter to place his rapidly ac
cumulating millions in safe invest
ments. It is said that he has turned
his attention recently to the City of
Mexico as offering a promising field
for investment of his surplus millions
in banking and other enterprises.
EMPLOYS ARMY OF MEX.
AUSTIN, Tex., Auff. 27. â The
wealthiest man in Mexico and one of
the wealthiest on the American con
tinent-is General Luis Terrazas, Gov
ernor . of the State of Chihuahua,
which borders on the western and
southwestern part of Texas. He has
just been granted a four months' leave
of absence and it is said he will make
an extended visit to the United States.
He will spend some time at St. Louis
visiting the World's Fair. The wealth
of General Terrazaa is conservatively
estimated at $150,000,000 gold, but it
may be many millions in excess of that
amount. Some of those who are In
close "touch with his business - and
financial affairs say that $200,000,000
is near the correct amount of his for
tune. General Terrazas is 75 years
old, but he is still full of mental and
physical vigor.
General Terrazas is probably the
largest individual land owner in the
world. He owns in fee simple ap
proximately 20,000,000 acres of land,
which is divided into fifteen haciendas
or ranches. Some of this land is in
a high state of agricultural develop
ment and th remainder is well adapted
for stock raisins'.
No one. not even General Terrazas
himself, knows the number of cattle
he owns, but it is roughly estimated
that his herds approximate 1,000,000
head.of which about 200.000 head are
cows. He also owns several hundred
thousand head of horses and mules.

Three conferences had been pre
viously held without arriving at a set
tlement of the difficulty, the rock upon
which both sides split being the
"closed" shop demanded by the union
and the "open" shop ywhich the em
ployers insisted upon. [ Mayor Schmitz
had not given up all hope and when
he saw an opportunity to bring the
disputants together again he took ad
vantage of It. Both sides appeared
willing to discuss the matter once
more, but without much hope of an
agreement being reached.
The conference yesterday took the
same turn as the previous ones and it
locked â¢ as though the negotiations
would again come to naught. The
"open" and "closed" shop still re
mained the' snag and the opposing fac
tions rose up from. their seats at one
stage of the proceedings and said it
was useless to continue the discussion,
as it was apparent that no agreement
could be reached. It was then that
Mayor Schmitz, taking a . last des
perate chance, jumped from his chair
and locked the door of his private of
fice, where the meeting was held,
saying:
"Now, gentlemen, you must come
to some agreement," he said. "Let us
talk it over again."
The Mayor's remark seemed to
create a better understanding: and a
settlement was soon reached. The
terms of agreement were not made
public, the Mayor saying that it was
deemed advisable not to make them
known at the present time. It is un
derstood that points favorable to both
sides were agreed upon. . The union
men will be taken back to work ana
the employers agree to recognize the
union in matters pertaining to the
welfare of the hackmen.
At a conference held yesterday
afternoon in the office of Mayor
Schmitz, with the Mayor acting as
mediator, the hackmen's strike was
brought to &. close on an "open shop"
basis. An agreement, was signed
which will be in effect until June 30,
1905. Although both sides are re
ticent, it is authoritatively stated that
the Hackmen's Union < agreed to call
the strike off, the coniiideration being
that members of the union might ap
ply for work and would be' employed
as vacancies occur. Others not mem
bers of the union will be treated like
wise. Present non-union men will not
be discharged. (
The representatives of the Carriage
Owners' Association who were present
at the conference Included Secretary
White and Messrs. Coleman, Pierce,
Fagan.. Kelly, Perry, j Conlon, Nolan
and Michelson, while 'the Hackmen's
Union was represented by J. Coyle, M.
Coffey. J. Murphy and T. . Dowlingr.
It Is even alleged that the union men
have interfered with the plaintiff's
vehicles at various funerals, and have
demanded at the funerals the per
sons get out of the carriages owned and
driven by the plaintiff and its employes
and ride In a union carriage. By reason
of these acts the plaintiff is unable to
accept an order for vehicles at a funeral
in this city. It is alleged that the in
terference at funerals was by a resolu
tion passed at a regular meeting of the
Hackmen's Union.
The defendants are said to be still en
gaged in the acts complained of and
have already damaged the plaintiff In
the sum of $1000. The defendants are
Bald to be financially Irresponsible and
unable to respond to a Judgment for
damages. "iVj-:
The "court is asked to perpetually re
strain them from committing any and
all of the acts .mentioned.
It is declared that the pickets, who
gather in large numbers, call out to the
public in general that the plaintiff con
ducts an "unfair stable" and that it is
an enemy to organized labor. Some of
the alleged language of the pickets is
quoted, including, "If you work for this
scab we will" beat your brains out,"
"You are a band of scabs and we will
get you.'- In furtherance of the- con
spiracy the unions .are charged with
having placed pickets in front of the
grocery of West, Elliott & Gordon, de
claring a boycott against the firm,
which refused to remove Its four teams
from the stable. /
The complaint continues that upon
the refusal of the plaintiff to enter into
the contract, and "in order to coerce
plaintiff to subject its business to the
control of said Stablemen's Union," a
boybott was declared upon the place. On
April 27 the union men were ordered to
quit work. Since the strike the plaintiff
has been a^d now is employing non
union stablemen and hackmen.
1 It â¢ is charged that the unions con
spired to impede- the plaintiff in its
business, and by threats, intimidations
and assaults on employes who took the
places of the strikers attempted to force
them to quit their service.
The stable has made contracts with
certain of its employes who took the
places of the strikers to work for a defi
nite period, and expects to make other
such contracts with other persons. It
is charged that the two unions have
conspired to force or induce the new
employes to break their contracts. It is
also charged that the " unions have
placed pickets in front of the stables
who have waylaid and continue to
waylay and threaten the non-union
men.
The complaint declares that repre
sentatives of the unions have gone to
customers and patrons of the plaintiff
and requested and demanded that they
remove their horses and vehicles from
the stable under threat and notice of a
boycott. Among th'e persons so ap
proached are . named West, Elliott &
Gordon arid the-Board of Public Works.
PICKETS ARE BOTHERSOME.
The prolonged trouble between the
Stable Owners' Association and the
Hackmen's and Stablemen's unions has
borne frout in another suit for injunc
tion, which gives promise of a fight to a
finish. The -Hayes Valley Stables, a
corporation, wants the two unions
perpetually enjoined from the com
mission of practically the same acts
complained of in the suit of the Nevada
stables against the Stablemen's Union,
in which Judge Hunt rendered his no
table opinion against the boycott. . In
this case, however, the Hackmen's Un
ion is the defendant and tha charges are
still more startling, in that the 'union
men are accused with interfering with
funerals in order to' disturb non-union
hack drivers. The case has been as
signed to Judge Hunt for hearing, but
the day of trial has not been set.
The title of the case is the Hayes Val
ley Stables, a corporation, against the
Hackmen's Union Local No. 224, M. W.
Coffey. J. Dowling, W. M. White and
Pete Sherman; the Stablemen's Union,
Local No. 8760, T. F. Finn, T. J. White,
C. P. Monroe, Chris Reynolds, John Doe
Cooper, Tom Hannon and Tim McGraw.
The Hayes Valley stables are at 538
544 Hayes street. It is alleged In the
complaint that on or about Apr^l 27 rep
resentatives of the Stablemen's Union
called upon the manager and informed
him that he must sign a contract with
the union to the effect that none but
union men should be employed, fixing
the schedule of wages, limiting the
work to be assigned to one man, pre
scribing a twelve-hour day and the pay
for overtime and other matters, in ac
cordance with the union rules. He was
warned that if the contract was not
signed the union would order a strike.

NEW YORK, Auff. 27. â The Finan
cier says:
"The feature of the official statement
of the New York Associated Banks last
week was its failure fully to restrict
the withdrawals 'of gold for shipment
abroad and of currency for transfer to
the interior, the statement showing a
net decrease of $1,804,000 cash, whereas
the traceable movements of money
during the week indicated a loss- of
$4,872,700. The discrepancy of $3,06S,100
between the estimated and the record
ed loss of cash may in part be ex
plained by the fact that the averages
of the week's traceable withdrawals
amounted to $3,700,000, Including those
on Saturday, August 20, and the 22d.
Even with this, however, there
was shown a wide discrepancy,
and, moreover, direct shipments to the
interior were not fully accounted for;
therefore it appears clear that, the
I statement, so far as regards cash, was
! made upon declining averages.
"Deposits decreased $2,267,700, -while
the sum of the contraction of loans and
the loss of the cash was $1,065,000 less
than the decrease of deposits, hence
the statement did not prove. It goes
-without saying that the statement was
a dlsappoinment to the majority of the
banks, the managers of which had dur
' ing the week observed with much sat
' isfactlon the withdrawals of money,
: hoping that the statement would so far
reflect this movement in the surplus as
, to denote the beginning of the end of
the monetary congestion at this cen
ter. But the surplus is still so large
that it seems probable that, unless
there shall be extraordinary withdraw
als in the near future there will be lit
' tie relief from congestion for some
; time.
! "Still, advices from the Western cen
, ters note large shipments of money to
the agricultural sections and if, as the
result of high prices for wheat and cot
ton, these commodities shall* be freely
marketed later, withdrawals of money
may be unusually heavy for the be
ginning of the season; there is, there
fore, a, fair prospect for the continu
ance of the decline of money from New
York in increasing volume."
That fact makes this sale doubly wel
come. Xo need of going Into the details
of this nne purchase, as maker's loss
does not interest anybody, but the
thrifty man won't skip this opportunity

It was with amiable intention that
Mrs. Christine Capaul dropped into the
home of Mrs. Ellen Howes, 34 Minna
street, and sat down in the kitchen to
gossip. For a while the visit was mu
tually delightful and might have ter
minated in amity If Mrs. Howes had
not inadvertently said something un
complimentary about one of Mrs. Ca
paul's dearest friends. Even then it
might have been impolitic for Mrs. Ca
paul to contradict Mrs. Howes' state
ment, for the code of social etiquette
prevailing in the set to which both la
dies belong confers upon the hostess
certain conversational privileges .which
It Is bad form to resent- At any rate
Mrs. Capaul's defense of her absent
friend's character provoked Mrs. Howes
to the harsh extreme of ordering Mrs.
Capaul to leave the house and never
again darken its portals, which angered
Mrs. Capaul to such an extent that she
deliberately smashed Mrs. Howes' com
plete equipment of kitchen crockery,
dish by dish. Then she was arrested
for malicious mischief and disturbing
the peace, and Judge Conlan pro
nounced her guilty of both offenses and
will sentence her to-morrow. - .
San Francisco can boast of several
social organizations more pretentious
than "The Easy Dues Club," Joseph
Sullivan informed Police Judge Ca
baniss, but no city on earth possesses
one that Is more exclusive, affords its
members better enjoyment or costs
them less money for maintenance. As its
title implies, "The Easy- Dues" draws
lightly UDon the pecuniary means of
the twelve young gentlemen who es
tablished It. Yet it has a cozy home at
COD Noe street, between Sixteenth and
Seventeenth, less luxurious than the
quarters of the Bohemian or the Pa
cific-Union, but lacking nothing that
modest taste might suggest.
It was after a bal masque given by
'â¢The Easy Dues" last Friday evening
that Sullivan was arrested on the, Bar
bary Coast and charged with vagrancy.
Attired as a United States Jackie he
tripped thÂ« light fantastic until mid
night, escorted his young lady to her
home, then wandered down town and
into a Pacific street dance hall, where
he resumed his wooing of terpsichore
until a police raid of the place stopped
the festivities. He was among those
netted. When a policeman asked him
what he was doing away from his ship
at that hour of the morning he replied
that he had no ship. He told the truth
when interrogated as to where he ob
tained his sailor garb, but the officer
did not beJieve him â even went so far,
indeed, as to suggest that he was either
a i deserter or a thief, and ran him In
with as greasy a lot of vagrants as
ever posed the police court.
"Your primal mistake, Mr. Sullivan."
said the Judge, "was in. neglecting to
doff your masquerade costume before
3'ou - went a-slumming. Your going
a-slummlng at all was also reprehensi
ble, especially as you had been dancing
all the evening."
"That's just it. your Honor," respond
ed the defendant; "my love of dancing
is responsible for my plight. The club
dance only whetted my appetite, so to
speak, and it was to dance myself tired
that I went to Pacific street."
"There is no law to either prevent or
punish overindulgence in dancing," said
the court, "and I'll continue the case
until next Monday, by which time the
police will have ascertained whether
you are punishable for vagrancy. Your
plea of membership in the exclusive
â¢Easy Dues' is all right as far 'as it
goes, but it does not prove visible
means of honest living. In the mean
time you are at liberty to go home and
resume your civilian apparel."
Former Congressman Julius Kahri
will defend Theodore Macopulos, an
Armenian peddler, from the charge of
forgery that is to be heard before
Judge Cabaniss on September 3.
Randolph Nelson, able seaman, was
intoxicated and asleep in a Pacific
street saloon when Pedro Petrovicl?
took advantage of his helplessness by
stealing his watch and a few dollars
in cash. The robberv was witnessed
by a woman and Petrovich will hear
her story next Tuesday in the court
room of Judge Cabaniss. -
Frank Williams (colored) was evi
dently on robbery bent when, by means
of a skeleton kev, he entered a room
in the lodging-house kept by J. Carl
son at 6 Cappeler court, off Mason
street, and his surprise may be imag
ined when he found himself face to
face with a sturdy little Japanese man
who happened to be cleaning out that
very apartment.
"What you wantâ what do here?"
asked the Jap, as Williams confusedly
began to retreat.
"Nuffln. sah. nuffin," replied Wil
liams. "Ah Jes' made urn mistake.
Thought dis was my room. Dat's all.
Good day, sah."
â¢ "You one piecee liarâ you no room
dis place! Only white gentlemans
rooms have got."
Then thev mixed. Williams had the
physical advantage of his opponent,
but when the little man grabbed him
he was as clay in the hands .of the
potter. The noise of the scrimmage
attracted Carlson, who says that when
he entered the room the negro was
being utilized as" a duster by the Jap,
who alternately swept the carpet with
his woolly head and nicked cobwebs
from the ceiling with his feet. This
testimony was corroborated by Patrol
man Prill, who responded to Carlson's
shouts for police aid. After the ne
gro's removal the Jap resumed his
house cleaning. The case will be heard
next Tuesday by Judge Cabaniss.
leave it, as they could not dwell within
range of her tongue and maintain their
self-respect. Mrs. Goodfleld promised
to be quiet if she were restored to free
dom and the court gave her thirty
days to make good her pledge, sug
gesting at the same time that it might
be better for all concerned if she
changed her abode.

BOHEMIAN VOCALISTS
WILL SIXG IN PUBLIC
The constitutionality of the ordin
ance parsed by the Board of Supervis
ors providing that peddlers of theater
tickets or tickets for prize fights
should pay a license fee of $300 per
month was upheld by Judge Lawlor
yesterday. It was aimed to prevent
speculators from buying tickets and
selling them at a large profit-'
The decision was reached in the
case of Leon Weingarten on an appll
; cation for a writ of habeas corpus.
i Welngarten waa arrested on May 9,
1903, in front of the Orpheum while
j he was selling tickets without having
! obtained a license. The case was as
| signed to Police Judge Conlan's court.
jOn May 12 Weingarten was surren
j dered info custody and the applica
! tion for the writ was made on that
| date. On May 20 the case was dls
â¢ missed in Judge Conlan's court, but
I application for the writ was not with
! drawn, as it was desired to test the
j constitutionality of the ordinance.
Before giving hi3 decision dismiss
ling the writ and remanding the pris
oner Judge Lawlor asked Wclngar
ten's attorney if he could produce any
i evidence as to the reasonableness of
; the action of the Board of Supervisors
j in imposing such a license fee, because
1 he could not say it was excessive as a
jmatter of law. The attorney replied
i In the negative. The Judge suggested
that the matter be taken before the
Supreme Court, so that the point
could be definitely decided.
J As the case was dismissed on May
| 20, 1903, by Judge Conlan no further
I action can be taken against Welngar
ten.

CHICAGO, Aug. 27.â Having come to
this city with an incomplete address
as her only direction to find a relative,
Miss Ida Johnson, 17 years old, of Los
Angeles, Cal., will spend the night at
the Harrison-street station annex after
passing the day in a vain search for
her relative. Miss Johnson went to the
Chicago-avenue police station and told
her story to Captain Charles Rehm.
The captain advised her where to pass
the night, and the search will be re
sumed to-morrow.
Miss Johnson says that her uncle,
Alfred Johnson, aged 70 years, wrote to
her father asking the latter to send her
to nurse his invalid wife. He gave his
address as Milton avenue. With this
direction Miss Johnson left California
and arrived in Chicago yesterday. She
says that she left her valise at the Un
ion station in charge of one of the uni
formed attendants, . but received no
check for it. She immediately went to
Milton avenue, and consulting a direc
tory found many Johnsons, but none
was her relative.

SACRAMENTO. Aug. 27. â Seven
races were on the programme to-day,
making a card which interested the
bettors, and considerable money
changed hands. Six heats were re
quired to settle the opening race, the
2:13 trot. Rozelle won. the first heat
in 2:14, but after that he was unsteady
and a series of disastrous breaks in
the fourth heat caused him to be dis
tanced. The race finally went to Prin
cess, which took the second, fourth and
sixth heats. Forest winning the third
and fifth. Kelly Briggs, well piloted
by Wright, won the 2:10 pace after
Edwin S. had taken the first heat in
the fast time of 2:0S 1 / 2- Summary:

To-day's race, while not as rich by
many thousands of dollars as some of
the preceding: ones, was worth a total
of $54,290, divided as follows. To the
winner, $43,500; to the second, $4917;

STAKE A RICH OXE.
A few minutes after 4 o'clock the
horses were, lined up for the start.
There was a delay at the post, owing
to the size of the field,, but after a few
moments Starter Fitzgerald sent the
field away. * Sysonby, with Redfern
up, was on his toes as the barrier
snapped and took the rail. '. Artful was
away second and ra 9?d head and head
with Sysonby. for three-eighths of a
mile. Tanya and Tradition were third
and fourth, with the . other twelve
bunched behind- them. Redfern, on
Sysonby, seemed to have the race at
his mercy, but the light weighted Art
ful never lost an inch and _as they
rushed' past the half mile post Sy
sonby began to ,. tire. Hildebrand,
quick to see his advantage, began to
hand-ride the fleet filly. Inch by inch
he crawled up- and as they' dashed
past the five. furlong pole he was lap
ping Sysonby's saddle. -
As the racers tore down the stretch
toward the finish it was plain to be
seen that the, great son of Melton and
Optime was beaten. Tanya, which had
been running third, gave way to Tra
dition. Lyhe, ! on the latter, worked
like a demon in the 'last seventy yards
and succeeded in catchmgr Sysonby.
Artful in that distance had gone away
at every Jump. Passing under the
j wire she was five lengths in front of
Tradition. The -latter was a short
head in front of Sysonby. â¢
SYSONBY SHOWS IX FRONT.
A chilly wind during the morning
gave way after the noonhour to bright
sunshine and every inch of space in the
double-decked grand* stand was occu
pied. When, the., candidates paraded
past the grand stand to the post the
excitement was intense. In the betting
ring the struggle of would-be players
had for a half-hour preceding the bu
gle call been terrific. Keene's entry,
which had opened at 4 to 5, was backed
down until 13 to 20 was the best price
obtainable. Not a great deal of money
Â¦was risked, however, to force ,. the
price, because every bookmaker in the
ring openly expressed the belief that
Sysonby- would. win in a gallop.
NEW YORK, Aug. 27.â Artful, a
brown filly by Hamburg, bred by the
late William C. Whitney and bearing
the colors of Herman B. Duryea, won
the seventeenth renewal of the Futu
rity to-day at Sheepshead Bay. Tra
dition, bred by "James B. Haggin and
running in the name of Sydney Paget, ;
was second, while Sysonby, from the
stable of James R. Keene and bred In
Virginia, finished third. The Keene
entryâ Sysonby and Wild Mint â was
favorite in the betting at 13 to 20, but
was not heavily backed in view of the
short price. The Duryea entry received
the bulk of the public wagers at- 5 to 2.
Tradition was also heavily played at
the good odds of 4 to 1 for the place.
The time made was the fastest on rec
ord for the stake over the full six fur
longs, the distance for the race since
1902. â¢ Â¦ â¢ Â¦ Â¦

NEW YORK. Aug. 27.â The Herald
will say to-morrow: "There Is a rather
strong possibility that the election re
turns on the night of November 8 will
show a Democratic House of Repre
sentatives for the Fifty-ninth Con
gress.
"Under the peculiar conditions which
are prevailing in various parts of the
country it is possible that the Repub
licans may elect their national ticket
and still lose the House by a large ma
jority.
"The Herald has made an investiga
tion of this subject and is able to pre
sent a few hard facts, based on careful
inquiry and reliable information.
"Put briefly, the situation is that the
Democrats have rather the better of it
at the outset of the campaign. There
are 3S6 members of the House of Rep
resentatives. In the present House
there are 20S Republicans, 172 Demo
crats, two Union Labor delegates and
four vacancies. The Republicans thus
have a majority of thirty-four.
"Investigation shows that in the
United States there are 159 districts
that can be counted safely Democratic.
There are 156 districts that can be
counted safely Republican. There are

SALT LAKE, Aug. 27. â As a cul
mination of the great bitterness aris
ing from the recent Republican State
Convention, at which Governor H. M.
Wells waa defeated for a third-term
nomination, Alma Katz, brother-in
law of Governor Wells and a member
of the staff of Governor Morrison of
Idaho, and Dr. H. N. Mayo, who was
elected as a Wells delegate to the con
vention, but who voted j for John C.
Cutler, had a 'flat fight on Main street
to-day in which both were badly
bruised.
Dr. Katz was Governor Wells' cam
paign manager. He and Dr. Mayo
nearly came to blows on tbj^ floor of
the convention, at which time Katz
unmercifully scored Mayo for his de
fection, and to-day when they met
on the street Mayo demanded a retrac
tion. This was refused and the fight
followed.

NEW* YORK. Aug. 27.â With the de
feat of Sysonby. the odds-on favorite
for the Futurity, almost every big bet
tor on the American turf recorded a
loss in his betting book. The principal
losers were John W. Gates and John A. 1
Drake. Between them they wagered
about $100,000 on Sysonby. Judging
from the reckless manner in which
they played their bets with bookmak
ers, Gates and Drake believed the son
of Melton could not possibly lose.

NEW YORK, Aug. 27. â It was re

bolted the regular parties at the State
Convention last April, Is to be formed
in New Jersey. It is to be known as
tHe People's Democratic party and is
to have a convention in Atlantic City
on or about September 7 to nominate
a State ticket and Presidential electors.
It was said also that the call for the
convention will be issued in a few
days.

The second class doubles tennis tour
nament held at the park courts yes
terday by the members of the Ladies'
Annex was not up to the mark of. re
cent events held by these fair racket
â¢wielders. In fact interest was hardly
aroused in any of the matches and In
nc instance did a team need to play
the full three sets to win out.
Miss Vera Crocker and Miss Ida
Mearns, the holders of the three-time
trophies, had little trouble in reach
ing the final round. The Misses Meyer
and Vodden, their opponents, had to
play but one match to get this far, as
Miss K. Lindstrom and Miss A. Al
berger defaulted. The final match
was as one-sided as could be, Miss
Meyer and Miss Vodden playing poor
ly. Not fifteen minutes had elapsed
when the first set was over. In the
second matters were somewhat closer
focthe first four or five games. Miss
Crocker and Miss Mearns then showed
their superiority by winning out
easily.
The closest game of the tourney
was In the first round between Miss
Bbssie Culley and Miss Alice Duncan
against the Traverner sisters, Marlon
ajid Clare. The first set was the best.
After many good rallies the Traverner
sisters won out, 6-4. The second set
was won by 6-3.
In three matches 'the winners lost
but seven games and in no instance
did they have to extend themselves.
Their first was against Miss Levlnson
and Miss Lea, the first set being won
without the -loss of the game and
the second 6-2. Against the Traverner
sisters the two-time cup winners
lost one game in the first set and two
In the second. The Misses Mearns and
Crocker won the finals by the same
score as in the first match.
The scores follow: Preliminary
round â Miss Vera Beyfuss and Mis3
Edith Hess beat Miss Bessie Gardner
and Miss Greenberg. 6-0, 6-2. First
round â The Misses Clare and Marion
Traverner beat Miss Alice Duncan and
Miss Bessie Culley, 6-4, 6-3; Miss Ida
Mearns and Miss Vera Crocker beat
Miss Hilda Levinson and Miss A. Lea,
6-0, 6-2; Miss, A. Vodden and Miss
Golda Meyer beat Miss K. Lindstrom
and Miss Anna Alberger by default;
Miss V. Beyfuss and Miss Hess beat
Miss "Worcester and Miss E>. "Weed, 6-0,

A clam recently taken from Green
wich Bay, Rhode Island, weighed an
ounce over two pounds.
One thousand acres of the old Wood
burn farm In Kentucky have been
leased by j. B. Haggln for the . exclu
sive use of his trotters. Although, his
trotting stud ls'not so- prominent as his
thoroughbred establishment, Mr. 'Hag
gin owns and has bred. a. great many
fast performers and valuable producers.
The three-year-olds that have ap
peared in the stakes are a high-class
lot. Murray M, a colt by Hambie
tonian Wilkes, bred Â¦ at . the, Green
Meadow Stock Farm, Santa Clara,
holds the fastest record, having trotted
a third heat in 2:14 at Santa Rosa. He
was beaten the fourth heat and the
race, however, by the little filly Mamie
R, owned by Mannie Reams of Suisu'n,
in 2:15%. These two are without doubt \
the class of this year's three-year-olda '
In California, but neither was entered
in the Occident nor the Stanford stakes
at the State Fair.
The Occident stake proved the long
est drawn out race in its history and
took seven heats to decide. Almaden,
a son of that game racehorse Direct,
2:05%. that Monroe Salisbury beat all
the best Eastern pacers with, proved
the winner simply because of his
gameness and W. G. Durfee's good
driving. He had been a sick colt un
til a few weeks before the stake was
trotted and did not have as much speed
as he showed in his two-year-old form,
when he won the Breeders' Futurity for
two-year-olds and took a record of
2:22Â»4. The faster colts- split the race
up and tired, and. coming back to his
rate of sneed, were at his mercy after
four heats had been trotted.
The trotter Morosco, by Wayland W,
which T. C. Cabney is campaigning
through the circuit, is the best and
fastest of those that have started in
the slow classes this year In California.
He is owned by I. N. Minor of Arcata,
and, while not a handsome, horse, is a
bold-going and speedy trotter. The
bad judgment -displayed by his driver
in laying up the first heat of his race
at Sacramento en the opening day was
a surprise to every one. The prompt
action of the judges in fining him $50
was a mild punishment, but accom
plished the desired result and taught
the reinsman a lesson that he probably
will not forget for some time. Morosco
is capable of a mile in 2:10 under favor
able conditions, as his easy heat in 2:12
at Santa Rosa clearly shows.
The largest stake of the year for trot
ters, the $15,000 Massachusetts, was
won at Readville last Wednesday by
Consuela S, a daughter of the once
champion Directum, She was
bred by Monroe Salisbury, who is rac
ing her. She is ten years old. A pe
culiar feature of this race was that of
the three California-bred horses en
tered in It all got some of the money.
George G, the $15,000 horse, was award
ed third money, and The Roman, the
son of McKinney, bred by Frank H.
Burke of this city, won the fourth divi
sion of the purse. George G took a new
record by winning the first heat in
2:07%, which proves him to have all
the speed claimed for him. Of the
horses that were expected to make a
great showing in this race were John
Taylor and Snyder McGregor. They
were both frequent winners, but they
could not keep up with the . Califor
nians.
Sweet Marie, the Los Angeles mare,
is the biggest winner on the grand cir
cuit, having added nearly $15,000 to her
owner's bank account since she started
at Detroit. ' ' :
Lou Dillon, 1:58%, the champion trot
ter, has fully recovered and will try to
lower a record or two at the two days'
matinee meeting of the Association of
Driving Clubs, which opens at Cleve
land, Ohio, August 30. â¢ She will prob
ably be driven to high wheels In an at
tempt to reduce the record of 2:08% to
that hitch, now held by Maud S.
Arion, 2:08%, will be>sold at auction
during the Old Glory sale. In November.
He brought $125,000 when the late Mal
colm Forbes purchased him from the
Palo Alto stock farm, which was after
he had made his record of 2:10% as a
two-year-old to a high wheel sulky, a
record that has never been approached
by a two-year-old trotter since.
News from Cleveland Is to the effect
that the California-bred stallion John
A. McKerron was never In such good
physical condition as this year. He is a
grand-appearing stallion In every way.
H. K. Devereauxi his' owner, is cpnflr
dent he will Improve his record of
2:04%. So far; this season McKerron
has not been asked to go a faster mile
than 2:25, but from now on his speed
will be sharpened and he will be put on
edge for a flight against time at the
Memphis meeting in October. .
Excellent racing has-been seen on the
short California harness circuit this
year, the owners and trainers attribut
ing it to the absence of \he bookmak
ing fraternity from participation in the
game. However this may be, the fact
remains there has never been a season
of racing iij California where so few
heats have been laid up. There were
only two or [ three suspicious-looking
heats fronvIMeasanton to Santa Rosa.
The fast time made this season has
been'a surprise to the horsemen them
selves, who did not expect 2:10 to be
beaten by the pacers nor 2:15 by the
trotters. Dictatress, 2:08^4; Tom Car
neal, 2:08^; Kelly Briggs, 2:09U; Zo
lock, 2:09Vi. and Highball, 2:09%. are
some of the new 2:10 pacing perform
ers the California circuit has produced
to date.
Among the fast trotters that have
dropped Into the 2:15 list are Morosco,
2:12: Coronado, 2:12%; Ole. 2:llVi; H D
B, 2:13; Una K, 2:14Â»A; Lady Madison.
2-.14U: Briney K, 2:15. and Princess,
2:14.
Jeffries' theatrical venture will be
n;;ide under the management of Sam
Mott, an old-time dramatic manager
of San Francisco.
Should any one appear who is look
ing for an argument with the big fel
low he will -t>e accommodated, pro
vided, of course, that he makes him
self knoven before Jeflries has been
out of business so long that it will be
impossible for him to get into con
dition. Otherwise the boiler-maker
will retire on his laurels as the only
Â¦undefeated champion of the world.
Zick Abrams is out with a challenge
on behalf of Jack Johnson, the colored
heavyweight who thinks he wants to
lisht Jeffries. Radium is said to have
certain qualities which can change the
color of individuals. If Juhnson ever
faces Jeffries in the ring thft kaleido
scopic changes of color whic* will re
sult irtll cast all the effects of radium
into the shade. At that Johnson
Fhould make an immeasurably better
t-howing than ctid Munroe.
Because of the lack of more worlds
to conquer Jeffries has been forced to
seek a new occupation. He has de
cided to exchange the glare of the
lights ovor the squared circle for the
footlights. The burly champion has
decided to take the advice of his trainer
iir.d will retire from the ring.
Billy Delaney said yesterday that
ofier a month's rest the champion
would prepare to take a theatrical
company on the road, starting about
October 1. Ju?t what production will
ht selected has not yet been definitely
determined, but Jeffries will probably
jiFFume the leading role in "Davy
Crockett." He will take a company
of California actors and will play the
coast cities first. If the venture proves
ETCcessfuJ Jeffries will journey East,
after which he will visit the cities of
ihe South, which he has never yet
vipited.
-Jack Munroe was sore In body and
rpirit yesterday over the outcome of
his little seance with Jeffries. The
miner's face had the appearance of
having been mauled with an iron in
strument, but the injuries were only
the result of contact with Jeffries'
l>aÂ£dÂ£d fists.
Uusroe] moved about all day as
though in a trance and was disconso
late. He knows he did not put up the
light of wh'.ch he was capable and re
jrrets his poor showing. He could not
sjft up steam with th3 terrible form of
Joffi-ies before his eyes. He will go
East and will try to make a fresh start
â¢with some of the lesser lights of the
Jin?.

lost the" game to Oakland to-day by
afl-round poor playing, 'Â¦ Raymond, at

Umpire Jack O'Connell had a bunch

The tiger-tamer cra^vled through the

wanted to say what he thought of
O'Connell, but professional etiquette
forbade. Just as he wondered how he
could relieve his wrath James Morley
flitted by arm-in-arm with a big smile
that disguised Henry Harris.
"What have you got to do with it,

Mr. T. Eugene Eagan won a pair of
shoes in the first. He laced out a two
sacker that hit the painted shoe on the
left field fence. The foot tailors who
stuck it ud offered the prize. They'll
have a hard time making good if Hans
Anderson ever lands. He wears wooden
ones and there is a wagon-load of tim
ber in them.
It was 3 to 2 up- to the fifth, with
Mike Fisher the gleeful kid.' Over in
the little grocery around the corner
Mrs. Murphy was ordering sliced bacon
and a dozen hen oranges for the Sun
day morning breakfast of the Clan
Murphy.
Just us Fritz Dinglefinger, the clerk,
was subdividing the bacon into slices
a loud hurrah came from the ball park.
Fritz was a baseballer once.
"Dot's not Mike Fisher's voice," he
said. "The' Seals are catching up. Ox
coore me, I find out."
"My bacon end eggs first," demand
ed Mrs. Murphy.
Fritz dumped the bacon into a paper
bag, and in his hurry sliced the eggs.
He bolted out of the door and reached
the gate in time to hear that the Seals
had run up seven. /
Though the Tigers hatd headstones
ordered for the Seals in the first inning
at Recreation * Park yesterday/ the
Frieoans, like- P. Malone- Esq., forgot
tfcat they were dead in the fifth. Bar
ber, who received as bad a walloping a&
Munroe at the start, opened the Frisco
end of the fifth with a single. lie
closed the .act with the same stunt."
That was going a little bitâ two safe
swats in one inning. It happens about
as often as Christmas! \ -.'1 .

Columbus, Ohio, May 19, 1903.
Some four years ago I was suffering
from impure blood and a general run-
dcrwn condition of the system. I had no
appetite, was losing flesh, and had an all-
gone tired feeling that made me misera-
ble. I began tbe use of S . S. S., and
after taking seven or eight bottles my skin
was cleared of all eruptions and took on a
ruddy, healthy glow that assured me that
my blood had been restored to its nor-
mal, healthy condition. My appetite was
restored, as I could eat anything put be-
fore me, and zs I regained my appetite
I increased in weight, and that "tired feel-
ing" which worried me so much disap-
peared, and I was once again my old self.
I heartily recommend S. S. S. as the
beet blood purifier and tonic made, and
strongly advise its use to all those in need
of each medicine. Victor Stcbbins.

poor game, failed to get going, while
McNaught played in fine form.
In the other tourney match J. C.
Moffat easily won from J \V. Elder
by a score of 21 to 7.
â¢ In practice the singles games be
tween Tickner and Medau and Patter

S. G. Bennett of the United States
Geological Survey was present at tha
heaxinsr. but did not testify. Ha has
been asked by the commission to gi"i>
views on stream gauging and on water
sheds and reservoirs, which ha will do
at a subsequent meeting. The hearing
will continue next Monday at 10
o'clock.
Th? commission of engineers con
tinued Its hearing of plans to <5o away
with the flood waters In the Sacra
mento River Valley yesterday morn
ing.
J. W. Ferris, a civil engineer of San
Francisco, who is the manager of a
large area of swamp land in the val
ley, had numerous suggestions to of
fer to the commission, He dealt with
the problem of reclaiming lands from
the rivers* overflow by means of
passes and canals to carry away the
surplus water. He also spoke of
deepening and widening the channels
of the several rivers by automatic anil
clamshell dredges.
During this inquiry It developed
that dredging contractors charged the
Government nearly doublt the prlcÂ«
they do private parties by reason of
the fact that the Government's re
quirements were so strict.
Fore Part of Yesterday Is Devoted to
Listening to Evidence on Chan
nel Dredging.
Another important change is in the
manner of electing officers. Hereafter
the president and other active officers
of .the club will be elected by a direct

AMERICAN CUPPER SHIP .SHEXAXDOAH, WHICH 15 MAKING SUCH A
LONG TRIP FROM RAL.TIMORK TO THIS PORT THAT THOSE INTERESTED
IN THE VESSEL ARE GROWING ANXIOTS TO HEAR FROM HER.
Britisher Arrives
Safely From
Antwerp.
The Peleus had a very stormy pass
age around the Horn, shipping seas
vhich did -considerable damage about
vhe decks. Terrific squalls, accompa
nied by hall, snow and sleet, made life
on the Peleus miserable for many days.
The gales on June 20 began to sweep
from the southeast. Their force sent
the Peleus, under reduced sail, bound
ing on her way, but so high did the seas
run that for days the main deck was
full of water to the topgallant rail.
During the worst of the weather a
spar broke from Its lashings and
the crew, up to the neck in water, had
a hard struggle to secure the huge tim
ber, which at times threatened to ram
holes in the bulwarks. During the fight
with the loose spar the lives of the sail
ors were in constant peril, both of in
jury from the spar and of bemg carried
< verlioard by the seas which constantly
swept .the Peleus' deck.
After rounding Cape Horn the Peleus
made a good run in the Pacific, and
'Â¦"â¢hen she arrived here yesterday there
â¢uas little slgrn of damage about her or
derly, e'.ean-scrubbed decks.
The British chip Peleus, which ar
j :ved yesterday, 129 dayÂ« from Antwerp,
made the long voyage In fairly srood
time in spite of the fact that frequent
storms beset her path. Death claimed
one of the crew and the seas wrought
ronsiierable damage about the decks,
but the Peleus came into port In good
condition and with her cargo intact.
She left Antwerp April 10. Three days
out cf port Lars Johansen, the ship'"
< arpenter, was taken ill. Captain Shap
land exhausted the resources of his
medicine chest, but "Chips' " aliment
Â¦was too complicated for thÂ« crude doc
loring of the mariner phy6idan, and
fnu r days later Johansen died and was
buried at eea. He was a native of Nor
"â¢vay, aged 5S years. *

Do you want to be p'*%, Everybody Admires
I WILL PAY F'ORF'EDn""
For a case of Nervous Debility, Varicocele, Rheumatism. Lame Bacjc, Lumbago, Sciatica, any case of Kidney Disease (tfcpKSfes not gone as far
as Bright'sJUiseasc.), Indigestion, Contipation, or any weakness which 1 cannot cure with my new improved Electric Belt, wit^jj^ric suspensory for
men (no charge > the marvel of electricians, the most wonderful curative device that has ever been introduced. yttae<
Give me a man broken down from dissipation, l.ard work or worr}-, from any cause which has sapped his vitality. LÂ«t hc^Vollow my advice for
three, months and I will make him as vigorous in every respect as any man of his age.
I will not promise to make a Hercules of a man who was Yiever intended by nature to be strong and vigorons. Even that man I can make
better ihun he is: but the man who has been strong and has lost his strength I can make as good as he ever was.
1 can "ive back to any man what he has lost by violation of the laws of nature. I can stop all drains upon the vitality in ten days.
A man \v"ho is nervous, whose brain and body are weak, who sleeps badly, awakes more tired than when he went to bed, who is easily discour-
aged, inclined to brood over imaginary troubles, who has lost ambition and energy to tackle hard problems, lacks the animal electricity which the
Dr. McLaughlin Electric Belt supplies.
The whole force of vitality in your body is dependent upon your animal electricity. When you lose that by draining^he system in any xnarmer
my Belt will replace it and will cure you.
Mr. Harry U. Jackson, Valleton. Cal., writes: "Although you are a stranger to me, my heart warms toward you as a great benefactor and friend, and I am more than
grateful to you. Already I teel the vigor of new life In my body; no aches and no pains. I wish you every success In your work."
Letters like that tell a story which means a great deal to a suttercr. They are a beacon light to a man who has become discouraged from use-
less doctoring. 1 get such letters every day.
My belt has a wonderful influence upon tired, weak nerves. It braces and invigorates them.^and stirs up a great force of energy in a man.
I make the best electrical bodv appliance in the world, having devoted twenty years to perfecting it. I know my trade. My cures after every-
thing else has failed are" my best argument-. â¢
Mr Roy Burks, McKlttrick. Cal., writes: "From the first night I wore the bolt I felt new life In every part of my body. The weakness was checked Immediately, tod I an now
ablo to do heavy work without tiring. I am glad I thought of the belt, for In no other way could the money bring me somuch pleasure." |j x
Give me a man with pains in his back, a dull ache in his muscles or joints, "come-and-go" pains in his shoulders, chest and side. Sciatica
in hi#hip, Lumbago, Rheumatism, or any ache or pain, and by"*elt will pour the oil of life into his achins: body and drive out every sij?n of pain. No
pain can exist where by Belt is worn.
Mr. J. L. Balrd of Orland, Cal., writes: "My back Is entirely well, and I would not take J100 for my belt if I could not set another. It is thÂ» best thin* on earth
for a lame back." ..... .. , , , , / ,
And these'"old" men. these men who have burned the candle at both ends â or even if they haven t â these men who have for one reason or
another feel that life has lost its spice, that they are getting old too fast, I can make them feel the sparkle and fire of youth again.
I'll never f<yget when Mr. A. Crawford of Pokegama, Oregon, an old man of seventy, wrote to me and said: "When I wrote to vou last I
told you to send me a Belt to make an old n\an young, and you did. I am seventy years old, and since I have worn the Belt I feel as strone as
I did at thirty- five, and can do as good a day's work as I could at that age." It was two years ago that Mr. Crawford wrote me that letter. Here is
one I just got 'rorn him: , .
"In reply to your letter I am glad to say that I am Just as much in favor of your Belt as I ever was, for It has been a remarkable help to me. I am seventy-two years old. but
I do not look any more than fifty. Am enjoying perfect health, and will continue to recommend the Belt, as I have been doing right along, as I realize that but for It I should have
been dead and buried by this time." .
They come every day from everywhere. There is not a town or in the country which has not cures by Dr. McLaughlin s Electric
Ndfc\ what docs this mean to you, dear reader? If you are not what you ought to be, can you ask anv better proof to make you try it? Is
there a remedv which is" as simple, as easy to use. as sure to cure ar.d as cheap as Dr. McLaughlin's Electric Belt? I have not seen one. You must
try it. In justice to yourself, and to those "who look to you for their future happiness, try it now. Act this minute Such a matter ought not be delayed.
It's as good for women as for men. Worn while you sleep, it causes no trouble. You feel the gentle, glowing heat from it constantly, but no
sting, no burning, 'as in old-stvle belts. , .
Come and sec me if vou can. I, have a private consulting, room m which I will explain my method of treatment, and, perhaps, Rive you the
names of some of vour friends whom I have cured.
Send for my beautiful book full of things a man likes to read if he wants to be a strrv~ man. I send it scaled, free. Cut out and send this ad.

CHICAGO. Aug. 27.â Wheat started out with
signs of strength, although there was nothing
of a seriously damaging nature In the early
reports of crop conditions. September was up
%@VÂ«c at $1 OC<??1 06% and December %Â®%c
at ?1 07%Â©l 07%, and these figures wera
seemingly based on a %c higher curb market
at Minneapolis, together with improved Liver
pool cables. After the first few minutes the
Ui ar^t} , lost ._ lts firmness and declined to
?1 059 4 for the nearer months and to $1 06&
for the deferred delivery. The bears ap
parently held hopes of a reiteration of advices
from Manitoba of a crop in excess of last
year s. The market was very nervous and
traders were little inclined to take long
chances either way. The low prices brought
out gome buying and the rust news was Just
bad: .enough to keep the bulls confident S-d
lV*i%Z to $1 0tt% and December to
$1 07% before the next wave of profit-taking
i h *Â« k Â£ d the u P- tu m- September dropped t*
$1 04^ and December to $1 O6yi. Much of
the loss was attributed to the unloading of
long lines accumulated by the leading bulls
yesterday and on the uncertain temper of the
market there were many smaller sellers ready
to assist the decline. During the final hour
a calm settled on the pit and with the receipt
of bull news from Budapest relative to almost
total crop failure there and from Kansas City
where It was said that elevators were almost
empty and but little wheat was to be had
the close was steady, with prices fractionally
higher. Final quotations were: September
fl 06; December. $1 07%; each option Kc
over yesterday's close.
Corn receipts were heavy and still larger

In the Sound country oats have riper.ed

ThÂ« reoorts a.bout hCDH vary according to lo

irrigated, the crop will be a good one. and
ricking will soon begin. In King and Pierce
Â« except nearest the mountains, where
there is nv^st moisture, the crop has been af

crop has bocn lessened.
Wheat harvewtin* and threshing continues
with satisfactory progress. Reports from Wal

â¢age, eastern Whitman County above a\-erage
while in western Whitman. Adams Epo

Ttut third crÂ«j of alfalfa is beinij cut in
the Irrigated valleys and in localities of the
weinern counties a second crop of clover is
r*ady to be cut. The dry weather has favored
the spreading of destructive forest fires They
were checked for a time, but the smolder

One shin, according to the official
reports just received at the Navy De
partment, averaged 3.15 knots # per ton
of coal and another only 2.4*0 knots
per ton. Of the two ships in this
pquadron it was found that one was
consuming CO rx-r cent more coal than
the other because of the fact that the
former had not been docked for near
ly a year and her bottom was in con
sequence no foul as to hinder her
