PROFITS FOR' POLICY. HOLDERS.
That Collins really did marry Char
lotte and not Agnes Newman seems
certain from the statement of Thomas
E. Curran, attorney, who was Collins'
best man. Curran says he knows Char
lotte and that he knew A^nes. and' that
there is no doubt that the first named
was the bride at Collins' first weddine.
Now comes another stranee nart of
the tale resting on the death and -the
settlement of the estate of Agnes New
man, or whate\ r er her name may have
been when she died. Collins is alleged
to have obtained -from. the Hlbernia
Bank a balance left there by Acnes at
the time of her death. For this act.
Tobin & Tobin, attorneys for the bank,
last year began disbarment proceedings
against him. The Tobins filed an ; af
fidavit alleging that Agnes was never
the wife of Collins, but that, he was in
fact married to Charlotte.
Charlotte makes the -Statement.
which adds to the melodramatic situa-
The woman at 251S Pierce street, who
claims to be the wife of the attorney,
claims to have a marriage certifi
cate signed by Father M. D. Con
nelly, who certifies to having mar
ried Charlotte , Eugenia . Newman
and George D. Collins on May 15. 1899.
Miss Florence Newman, her sister, and
William Newman both declare they
â¢were present at the ceremony and that
Charlotte and George D. Collins were
actually married.
In answer to this Collins is reputed
to have made a statement which, when
one comes to it in the history of this
strange case, makes one really wonder
if he is not, after all, readlns: fiction In
stead of the facts of a case developing
in the city of San Francisco. Collins.
It is said, declares that he was married
to Agnes M. Newman on the date men
tioned, and that a mistake was made
in the marriage certificate, the name
of Charlotte being written instead of
Agnes. When Agnes died in 1901 she
â¢Â«vas buried under the name of Acmes
Collins. ' \u25a0; \u25a0 ..;., v -:.
Here is a woman who for years has
been accepted as the wife of a promi

Is reputed to be a married man, and
cays with seeming confidence that he
\u25a0will prove he was a widower when he

THE MARRIAGE CERTIFICATE.
A matrimonial tangle that xs perhaps
the most peculiar in the hymeneal
records of San Francisco has enmeshed
George D. Collins, attorney. Two wom
en claim to be his wife and many friends
\u25a0who are puzzled over the strange
case are wondering what the outcome
\u25a0will be. It appears that only court
proceedings where sworn witnesses
fhail give their testimony and official
records shall be produced will serve to
calve the mystery. It is likely that the
matter will be taken into court through
criminal proceedings, instituted by the
woman v.ho claims to have the prior
right to call Collins husband.
, Last Wednesday. The Call published^
en account of Attorney Collins ar
riving from Chicago with a new bride,
a former Stockton belle, who was Miss
Clarice McCurdy. He wrote his own
rame, then "Mrs. George D. Collins"
tind then "Mrs. S. A. McCurdy," giving
Chicago as the address. Friends at
o"hce began offering congratulations and
caking him about the bride, but he
rave no information, only . replying
vith a laugh. To The Call representa
tive he would give no account of his
r:arriage nor tell who his bride was,
caying his private affairs \u25a0evould not be
given out by him to satisfy public
curiosity. His sudden marriage and
peculiar actions created much gossip,
but the matter was soon lost sight of
by the public.
Now the lady calling herself Mrs.
Charlotte E. Collins, who lives at the
home of George D. Collins at 2519
Pierce street, asserts that she is the
lawful wife of the attorney and mother
of the three children that indisputably
belong to him. She has passed for
years as Mrs. Collins and the neighbors
end all her acquaintances have con
sidered her as such. Collins declares
that she is not his wife, but that he
\u25a0was married to her sister, Agrnes M.
Collins, who died five years ago, and
that Charlotte has been merely taking
care of the children since then. The
family name of the sisters was New
iwan and their brother, Charles New
man, is Â§i member of the Fire Depart
ment.
i tion, that she was urged by her son,'
j now 15 â and attending San Mateo Col
. lege â not to give testimony in the mat
1 ter, as, if she did, his father would be
! disbarred and disgraced and cut oft
I from the means of earning a livelihood
j for his family. Charlotte says she suf
fered the falsehood to remain undenied
by her until Collins brought back the
i bride from Chicago and announced her
i on the hotel register and to his friends
! as his wife.
j ADMITS SECOND 3IARRIAGE.
i The woman at 2519 Pierce street says
! that Collins spent Tuesday and Friday
] nights at their home with her. and both
j she and her brother assert that he as
j sured them he was not married to Miss
McCurdy. | v, ' , I , .', \u25a0 ,
i Collins made the following statement
last night: " '. * : '' r
. "Miss Clarice McCurdy was married
to me in Chicago on Easter -Sunday.
The marriage took place there and at
that time in order that her brother, an
Eastern man, might be present.
"The claims put forth by the woman
who pretends to be my wife and who
was in fact my sister-in-law, are un
founded and proceedings will be insti
tuted in court immediately to have it
iso determined. The same claim was
â¢ made by her to the Tobins and the Hi
j bernia Bank when the disbarment pro
ceedings were instituted against me.
The record of the proceedings shows
that at that time I vigorously opposed
her claim and denounced it as being
false in point of fact.
"Whatever influences and motives
prompted her then are undoubtedly re
sponsible for her present accusation.
There is much that I could say in detail
that would show the unreliable^charac
ter of the accuser as well as the falsity
j of the accusation, but one, must suffer
I much in silence to maintain the stand
ard of being a gentleman.
"Hundreds of people can testify that
Agnes M. Newman was married tc me,
and tradespeople dealt with her as my
wife. The present claimant knew the
facts as I state, them and the death rec
ords and burial plate show that the
claimant's sister was my *wife. The
claimant of to-day was fully conver
sant with what I state and she made
no statement to the contrary until lone
after my wife's death.
"I want a judicial determination of
this controversy and trust that news
papers and the public will permit the
courts to settle the question. â¢
ALLEGED PROMISE -TO AGNES.
"When Agnes M. Collins died she ex
acted a promise from me, that I would
always keep our children under the
care of my sister-in-law, and holding
sacred my word of honor I have always
supported them and Charlotte E. New
man. Now this Charlotte Newman
claims that I was never married to Ag
nes Collins, but am her husband. She
took the name Collins several years
ago, but I thought nothing of it until
the disbarment proceedings were. begun
against me. - .
"I did not like the connections of the
Newman family, but until a year ago I
thought that as I. had been a - bene
factor of them I would least be
shown some, respect. ,1 found ofut that
Miss Newman : was other than' the
character that I had supposed she was,
so I went to her and called "her to ac
count. She then appealed to. me in
most urgent tones, reminding me of
the sacred promise - 1 . had made < her
dead sister that she should' have cus
tody of the children. Considering this,
I left her temporarily 'in charge of
them, and now she claims to be my

mended-by President Roosevelt in. his
last l annual message. . Colonel Hep

pest or famine they die like 'flies," but in pros

MacARTHUR SPEAKS, i 'â¢\u25a0''\u25a0[ //
Cheering marked the conclusion, .of.
Tveitmoe's speech and the applause
broke forth once more when the chair
man presented Walter Mac Arthur. The
editor- of the Coast Seaman's Journal
delivered a strong oration and in vehe
ment terms called upon the gathering
to arouse and consider the seriousness
of the situation. In part he said: â¢
We want peaceful measures; but it will sure
ly mean war some day if the yellow hordes
continue to flock to our fair land without.;ln
terruption. Hawaii is a eort of stepping atone
. for the yellow pests to enter {.he United States.
They swarm in "there and It is but a step -for
them to land within the United . States. . Some
time ago more. than 800. of them arrived by'
steamer in the.Puget Sound. The citizens -of
the north protested to the authorities in Wash
ington, but the latter said they could do noth
lcg, as the Japs had come from United States
territory and could not be denied a landing.
A few days after their arrival every one of
them waÂ» working on the- Great Northern.
Railroad, taking the places -of so many white
laborer* who might have been in need of work.
FURUSETirS VIEWS.
The speech of Andrew Furuseth of
the City Front Federation was one of
the best of the afternoon, although
rather brief. In part he said:.
Where the Mongolian exists no . other race
can possibly exist. That ha* been proved by
scientists the world over. We must flght the
yellow peril as citizens, not as members, of
labor union*. We wIU be recognized Sln
Washington' as citizens, but as laboring men
and trade unionists we ctand no chance. I
heard high officials* In Washington plotting and
planning cheap labor and that but a short time
ago. We have enemies to fight there and we
must array ourselves to meet them in combat.
Other addresses were made by Mayor
Schmitz, Senator Wolfe, Justice of the
Peace Golden, W. J. French of the, L
abor Council and A. Saalfleld, represent
ing the Park Improvement Clubs. A
letter from Congressman Hayes was
read, In which he set forth his views
and promised to lend his aid to the
cause.
The promoters request that each la
bor union of the city send three dele
gates to the meeting next Sunday.
Some of the unions are represented in
the league by but one man, and the
presence of two additional delegates is
requested. The following committees
were named yesterday:

WITH PRESIDENT
Invitations for yesterday's gather
ing had been sent to United States
Senators Bard and Perkins and several
of the Congressmen and Governor Par
dee. It was impossible for any of them
. to attend the session, but they air sent
telegrams of regret, promising the pro
moters co-operation at Washington and
in general. . ...
Chairman Treitmoe called* the meet
ing to order at 2:30. He outlined the
history of the new league and told of
its aims and endeavors. He then
branched out at length in the first
speech of the afternoon. In part he

the number of Japs in the United States to

least 60.<X>0 of them, and the same number in
the Kawaii&n Idlanue. They are eomlng over
at the rate of 500 and 1000 a steamer since
the Japanese Government lately .refused to
place any restriction on inyn:gratkwi- from the
country. This Immigration has Increased to
an alarming extent since tne restriction was
taken off at the time of the KoÂ»s controversy
at Stanford a Tew years ago. They averaged

The American workman is not afraid of the

he cannot live !ikÂ« them, neither can he afford
to work for the wages they ask. Therefore. It

continue to overflow the country. They will

they threaun the existence of our nation.
The Japanese would rocngollze America if
they were given the chance. We should not

The note in the campaign that threat
ens to be waged against the Immigra
tion of Japanese into the United States
\u25a0was sounded yesterday afternoon when
O. A. Tveitmoe of the Building Trades
Council called the first mass meeting
of the Anti-Japanese League to order.
Thousands of representatives from the
labor unions of the city were present,
together with hundreds of others.
The meeting was addressed by some
vf the most prominent of talkers in' the
ranks of labor, including Walter Mac-
Artiiur'of theÂ« Coast Seaman's Journal,
Mayor Schmitz, Andrew Furuseth of
the City Front Federation, State Sen
ator Edward I. Wolfe. W. J: FrehchÂ«of
the Building Trades Council and others
whose voices have many times been
uplifted in the cause of the toiler. All
urged a vigorous campaign against the
yellow peri! in speeches that -resounded
with eloquence and determination. -
It was the first meeting called to or
der by the newly formed league and
the hall was crowded to the doors when '.
the chairman called the gathering to
order. Men from every walk of life
were represented.
After the speechmaking it was voted
to name committees for the work in
view. Committees on resolutions, cre
dentials and organization and order of
permanent business were named and
instructed to bring in their reports as
*oon as possible.
The members of the three committees
reported that they could not agree on !
anything definite without time and
prayed for a delay. Accordingly the
meeting was dismissed. The members
of the new league will meet again next
Sunday at 2:30 at 927 Mission street.

The stormy weather yesterday did not
prevent a large attendance at the pic
nic of the Knights -of the Red Branch
at Shell Mound Park. Some 1500 people
went to the grounds from this city and
Oakland, and they had a merry day
for raln^does not seem to dampen the
ardor of the Celt. The pavilion was
crowded â¢ with - dancers * and in ' the nro
gramme the leading Irish dancesâ the
four and eight hand ' reels, the his-h '
caul cap, the lark and other steps well '
known to the young people were danced I
Trtt &* i:eat enjoyment.. The games were "
exciting, and although" the ground was I
soft they were hotly contested.
Knights' Picnic a Success.
Along the ocean beach great rollers
swept up as far as the Ocean boule
vard. Yesterday the stretch of sand
looked as if an army of Titans had
swept the expanse with gigantic
brooms. The roar of the surf was
constant. The wind at Point Reyes
blew with a velocity of slxty-sbc miles
an hour.
Thirsty Los Angeles County for once
got almost as much rain as it wanted.
The downpour continued in that sec
tion all yesterday. Fresno and Port
land experienced heavy thunderstorms.
The downpour here yesterday morn
ing was like a prelude to the event
that caused Noah to paddle his own
canoe. It fell in bucketfuls and by
the noise it made it seemed as if the
buckets were falling with the raln
* drops.
The storm that woke San Francisco
out of bed before dawn yesterday

Leona Brooks, the woman for whom
Tsx Collector Edward J. Smith be
came a defaulter and who unwittingly
led him into the hands of the police
at St. IxÂ»uls, is due to>arrive here to
day. She started from St. Louis on a
ticket which the defaulter had bought
for himself.
Immediately upon her arrival she
will be taken to the office of Captain
Burnett, where she will be closely
questioned as to what she knows of
the defaulting official. ShÂ» is being
closely followed ,by Pinkerton detec
tives.
The heads of the Pinkerton agency
are confident that Smith has cached
a large part of his stealing, somewhere
In California. They believe that Leona
Brooks could throw some light on
\u25a0where the stolen money is hidden.
\u25a0\u2666 \u25a0 â
Woman Who Caused Edward ;J,
Smith's Downfall Expected
To-Day.
LEOXA BROOKS TO ARRIVE.
Mayor Schmltz last evening an
nounced that to-day he will appoint J.
H. Scott, a former incumbent, to tha
office of City and County Tax Collec
tor.
The new official will take the place
made vacant by the removal of de
faulter Edward J. Smith. Scott has
said that he will accept. He was the
first Tax Collector under the new char
ter.
The removal from the office of James
W. McCabe, the acting Tax Collector,
who has been accused of intemperance
and neglect of duty, is â¢ certain to
follow the appointment. If this is not
done by the new Tax Collector the
Grand Jury will take steps to have it
done immediately.
In announcing the appointment of
Scott, Mayor Schmitz said:
I have tried to set a comwwat, experienced
and. tried man for the otnee. Re&lizinc that
Mr. Scott bad filled thÂ» office very acceptably
curir.g his term and as various banks and real
estate houses declare that he rave satisfaction,
I offered him the place several days ago. He
declined at first, but later decided to accept
the office.
The newly appointed Tax Collector
said last night:
I have decided to accert the place for the
unexpired term. Under no circumstances, how
ever, will I accept the nomination for Tax Col
lector again.
Scott is a member of the piano firm
of Scott, Curtaz &. Co. He was elected
Tax Collector in 1699. It was alleged
that he was a non-resident at the time
of his election and the incumbent Tax
Collector, Edward Sheehan, attempted
to prevent him from taking the office.
With a crowd of his friends Scott
Invaded the tax office and took posses
sion forcibly. A fierce tussle between
Scott's friends and Sheehan's deputies
ensued. Sheehan and his men were
ejected.
Shortly afterward Sheehan Instituted
euit to be reinstated and the matter
was taken to the Supreme Court.
About two months ago it was decided
that Sheehan was entitled to the office.
Scott %vas one o-f the first officials in
the City Hall to employ civil service
-clerks' and deputies. He installed in
novations that made the running of the
office more systematic and convenient.
Foreman Andrews declined to say
anything yesterday in regard to
Scbmitz's retort to the letter recom
mending the dismissal of. McCabe. "It
is rather silly," he remarked. "!I will
reply to it to-morrow. ' I will say this,
that Saulman never gave me any. infor
mation in regard to Edward J. Smith [
or his crookedness." " i
Andrews says that Saulman, who de
clares that he told the foreman of the
Grand Jury several months ago that
Smith needed watching, came to the
jury rooms in December and asked for
protection from Smith's brothers. -An
drews referred him to the police. Since
that time Andrews has refused to see i
fcjauiman. j

ALBANY, X. Ti May 7.â Statistics
recently received by the State Depart
ment of Labor show that three foreign
countries, have as many organized
working people as New York State and
In proportion to population New â¢ York
leads these. Members of labor unions'
in -Great Britain 'and "Ireland Â£ number
1.902.508; ' 'in " Germany/: T,275;531; in.
France, 715,576, and in New Y0rk.400,
000.*.' The ratio Is one to each eighteen
Inhabitants in New York, one to twen
ty-two :in Great Britain, one to forty
four In Germany and one to fifty- three
in France.
â¢"It Is aslgnlflcant fact," said the 4 de
partment, "that the hours of labor are
short or long in almost the precise
ratio of the degree of organization."
The department's quarterly bulletin
states that in . the last quarter of 1904
the improvement In industrial activity
which began in the summer became so
pronounced that the percentage of Idle
ness was smaller than in 1903 or even
in 1902. â¢ The improvement ..was fairly
general throughout the various trades
and industries, with the single excep
tion of building. " .

ALAMEDA, May 7. â Pandemonium
producing planing and saw mills, with
gasoline engines, are to be excluded
from the residence portion of the city
and relegated to the marsh lands along
the estuary if the municipal leglsla-*
tors caD enact an ordinance legally
that will accomplish the desired result.
City Attorney M. W. Simpson has
drafted a restrictive wreasure affecting
the location of such mills. This will
come up for action at the next meet
ing of the City Trustees. The proposed
ordinance wan framed at the request
of residents and property-owners, who
complained of a small saw and planing
mill operated by a gasoline engine and
owned by E. A. Joyce at 1212 Benton
street.
Henry Mohns and G. W. Bennett
stated on behalf of the protestanta that
there could be no peace on earth and
good will toward a man who would
operate a mill with a buzzing saw, a
rasping planer and a sneezing gasoline
engine in a thickly settled district.
They asserted that the assortment of
ear-splitting sounds was a, menace to
the nervous systems of human beings
and decreased property values in the
vicinity in which they were created.
Joyce, whom the projected law is
chiefly aimed at. affirms that he has
been established at his present place
of business for four years and contends
that his mill is not a nuisance.

Mother of Mrs. Maybrlck Interested
in Show Girl.
NEW YORK, May 7. â The Baroness
Caroline yon Rogues, mother of Flor
ence Maybrick, arrived on the steam
ship La Touralne on Saturday night
and left to-day for Washington to give
her testimony in her suit against D.
W. Armstrong and others to recover
possession of certain lands. 9
The . Baroness Is broken in health.
Only twice during the seven days' voy
age" from Havre did she leave her
cabin. Mrs. Maybrick was at the pier
to greet her mother. It was the first
time they had met since Mrs. May
brick left France after her release
from prison.
The Baroness was deeply interested
in the "Nan" Patterson case.
"'The English papers are full of it,"
she said. "They make much fun of
American laws. They criticize the
opera bouffe manner in which the
poor girl was tried and they ridicule
the methods employed here in all mur
der cases."
Mrs. Maybrick took her mother to
a hotel for the night and to-day they
left for the capital. They will confer
â¢with their attorneys there and on
Tuesday go to Richmond, where the
Baroness filed her action against Arm
strong.
A feature of the parade was the di
vision of young girls, all dressed in
white, each representing , a Teutonic
lodge and each carrying a "beautiful
wreath of bay leaves tied with a rib~
bon bearing the name .of the " lodge.
Many of the, young ladies were in car
riages. The paths leading through; the
park were lined with relatives and
friends of the marchers, who followed
the line of march to the band stand. ,~
At", the stand Governor Pardee and
many of the young ladies, under the
direction of Supervisor Fred , Eggers,
were gathered. The column swung into
place . before the band stand, while the
band, entered .the structure. Back of
the lodges " were the friends and rela
tives, who - stood beneath umbrellas ito
hear the tributes to Schiller.
The ceremonies â¢at the stand were
opened with Gaune's "March of Tri
umph," followed by the chorus in
Kreutzer's "Schafers Sonntagslied,"
under the direction of Joseph.R.Rleg
ger. A short speech of, introduction by
E. A. Denlcke followed. He: spoke of
the glorious career of the poet they
were gathered .to honor, , and " briefly
compared him with the American poet,
William Cullen 'Bryant, whom he : mt>st
resembles. He * touched briefly on \ the
affectionate relations between -Goethe
and Schiller, and said that in honoring
one the ceremony would ; be -incomplete
without: honoring the other. * He ; then
Introduced the â¢; gue6t of * the morning,
Governor George C. Pardee. Â»:'
' Governor Pardee' s remarks â¢ were' f re
quently punctuated by applause/ He
spoke as follows:

Next came the various lodges, with
banners and insignia, all the riflemen
in uniform and marching with the
well-drilled regularity of veterans.. The
societies and verelns made up' a great
er part of the picturesque column, that
stretched more than half a mile.
The parade formed at 'Fell' and Stan
yan streets at 10:30 o'clock under, the
command of Grand Marshal Colonel

shal, and on. horseback, came his aids,
Auditor Harry Paehr, Fred Lass,
George Braun, L. H. ooecken, Theodor
Pinther and Fred Gessler. After them
came the band, under the leadership of
Paul Steindorff. , '
Despite 'the downpour of. yesterday
morning over a thousand German-
Americans braved the Inclement weath
er to pay tribute to the memory of one
of the greatest of Germany's poets,
Johann Christoph Friedrich yon Schil
ler. More than a thousand sons of the
Fatherland gathered to take part in
the parade and musical ceremony and
to lay floral tributes at the base of the
Schiller monument In Golden Gate
Park.
The weather undoubtedly/ served to
keep thousands 'away, but it did not
dampen the ardor of those who came.
Societies , from every part of the city,
verelns and schuetzen vereins joined
with the large chorus in singing the
poet's praise and formed in solid
maeaes around the band stand to listen
to the orators' eulogies of Teutonia's
beloved son.
The ceremonies showed the "result of
loving preparation, their . impressive
nesÃ being augmented by their simplic
ity. The morning; programme began
with a parade of more than fifty local
lodge*, headed by well-known German-
American citizens. At the band stand
â¢addresses. were made by Governor Par
dee and , German . orators. The "male,
chorus, varied the programme with
music appropriate to the occasion. Fol
lowing the speechmaking and singing
the floral tributes were disposed about
the Schiller-Goethe monument and the
ceremonies were over.

CHICAGO, May 7.â This , wÂ»ek , will
either bring . an end to the teamsters'
strike er \u25a0 else on* of the worst indus
trial upheavals In tha history of the
city.
The present trouble. -which has lasted
for. two weeks, has reached a point
where; the business man' involved ap
pear to hayÂ« gained a decided advant
age and the teamsters appear now to
be in a position where they must either
yield or decide to extend the strike by
calling out thousands of other work
men engaged in affiliated unions. This
the strike* leaders up to the present
time have refrained from dolnsr. while
on the other hand the . business men
to-day made preparations which, if
carried out successfully to-morrow,
will Indicate that the teamsters will be
compelled to surrender or call on \u25a0 th
, other unions for assistance. . '
The Chicago Federation of Labor, the
central body for all the unions of the
city, met to-day, but took no action
looking to an extension of the strike.
Resolutions were passed charging the
Employers* - Association with' con
spiracy, . and asking that . State's At
torney. Healy start an investigation of
their business methods.
Arrangements nave bÂ«en made by
every business house Involved in the
trouble to at least double their force
of non-union drivers to-morrow.
To-night It was said that all prepara
tions had been made to start out ona
thousand wagons to-morrow mornlnz.
manned by non-union men. Each o*
these wagons will be guarded by depu
ties or policemen and each one of these
men has received explicit instructions
to prevent disturbances of every kind.
If peaceful means fall, the deputies and
policemen have been Instructed to use
their revolvers and use them to kill.
To-day the seven express companies
made deliveries in all parts of the city.
Each of the wagons carried two armed
guards and in not a single Instance. It
was asserted to-night, had any of the
wagons met with opposition.
The Employers' Association, throueh
Its chief counsel. Levy Mayer, an
nounced to-night that it would do
everything in Its power to assist the
committee appointed yesterday by

that the union would assist the Mayor's
committee. ln every. manner possible. x

which causes so much discomfort and
robs menstruation of its terrors.
Miss Irene Crosby, . of 313 Charlton

" Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound

will be only half a crop. There vt\\\ be
an immense peach. crop. So heavy will,

COUNTY WILL REAP
VERY RICH HARVEST
WOODLAND, May 7.â Only so much
of the wheat crop as had, been cut was
damaged by the late rains. Fortunate
ly only'a small percentage of the crop
had been cut. The hay crop will be
very Jarge. Alfalfa fields look well and
will yield four or five heavy crops. The
wheat and barley crops will both be
much lighter than was predicted
earlier in the season. The rainfall was
far above the average, but, unfortu
nately, heavy showers fell at inoppor
tune times. The last showers benefited
late grain materially, but in some in
stances the early grain has been in
jured.
The almond crop will be light because
there" was a heavy rain while the trees
werein bloom, which washed off much
of the pollen. The prune orchards, with
but few exceptions, \u25a0 will yield light
crops for the same. reason. There will
be good peach crops In nearly every
district. The apricot yield will be good
In some districts and poor in others.
The peach crop will be good, especially
fn Western Yolo.
All varieties of fruit are of an excel
lent quality. . The grape crop, of both
the raisin and wine--- varieties, -- will be
better than usual.

FRUITS IN YOLO
NEVADA CITY, May 7.â The crop
outlook, in general In tnls county is
very encouraging and unless late and
untooked for frosts occur there, will be
a bounteous fruit crop. SomÂ«r of the
early fruits were injured by the cold
weather early in April, but the damage
is not so severe as was at first feared.
Peaches and cherries were the most
affected. The apple and pear crop will
be larger than usual.
The season is nearly one month
ahead of the usual spring season. The
feed In the foothills was better in Feb
ruary than it usually is in' May. The
farmers are well pleased with condi
tions and there is every Reason to be
lieve that the present season will prove
to be more abundant than last.

WINTERS, Slay 7.â The wet weather
of' the list week did considerable in
jury to the hay crop, which was less
than the average before cutting com
menced. Probably one-third of the hay
of this' region was on the ground dur
ing, the last storm and it will hardly
be .Â»-orth stacking. Both wheat and
barley were below the average, but the
rains will be of much benefit to them,
especially to the late sown grain, which
was in a bad way; There will not be
xr.ore than a fR-o-thirds crop, however.
The fruit crop will be about the av
erage. The crop of apricots will be
large, but the damp . weather has not
done them any pood. A. shipment of
apricots would have been made on May
t had the latter part yÂ£ the week con
tinue-^â- â nn, but t"re rains will cause
a d/lay of several days. Peaches are
lipm, but of. good quality. Pears are
very light. Plums are unusually heavy
and of nee size.
Following is a summary: Hay, two
thirds lost; wheat and barley, below
the average; apricots, heavy and good;
early peaches. light; midsummer
peaches, fair; plums, heavy crop; large
pears, very llgiit; prunes, very light;
almonds, pood. Season unusually fa
vorable for stock.
It is a -little too early to make an
estimate on the grape crop. It is be
lieved, hovrevej\ that they have been
slightly injured.
The grain and hay crops will bÂ»
large. Never before in the history of
the county was feed so good.

largest apple crop in Its history. Con

season. Last year the apple crop was
a comparative failure, owing to three
excessively hot days in October. -With
the possible exception of cherries, ap'fi-'

MILPITAS, May 7.â The fruit crop,
as compared with last year's, will be
short, the only exception being apri
cots, the yield of which. 'from the pres
ent outlook, will be large. Prunes and
cherries are estimated at about one
half a crop, and peaches will be 25 per
cent below the 'average. The recent
storm -will reduce the cherry, crop. .... \
The clover and volunteer hay crop,
consisting of about 1000 tons, is nearly
a total loss,, the recent rains having
spoiled all that was mowed up to the

about one-fourth of the crop. The grain

SANTA ANA , May 7.â The .prom
ise of ohenomenal crops bids fair to
fail of fruition, as from present pros
pects there will be great need of re
vision in the figures forecasted early in
the season. So far as fruits of all
kinds grown here are concerned,
peaches will be practically a failure,
apples Â»*ot more than a half crop,
while In some sections apricots are
fairly good and in others very, poor,
making it pc-ssible that from half to
three-quarters of an average crop. will
about be the final figures. It Is too
early, yet to estimate the probable
small fruit crop, but from present
prospects it will be above the average
yield.
The acreage of grain sown was great
er than last year, but the holding off
of the rains until late in the season
forced many farmers to bg-w on dry
plowing and when the rains came the
weeds outgrew the grain and choked
it completely in many places, and i. in
others, especially on light, sandy soil,
the extremely heavy rains packed the
ground and washed the ' grain roots . so'
that the, crop ne\ r er. recovered : and ' is
now maturing as a thin,* straggling
yield, with prospects of not mere than
three-quarters . of an average crop in
many places. A conservative estimate
puts the probableyleld of grain at very
Uttle more .than that of last year, but
there ! will be more hay than has been
harvested here for ten years.

rust, but it is confined to : the blades.
The' potato crop promises big, as; do
all summer crops of vegetables, beans,

The last rain made it necessary. to plow
up many bean fields. About half of,
the acreage had been planted. This
must- be planted again because of the
weeds. ' . -
All berries are excellent. The logan
berry, however, will not be largely
produced as the vines of perhaps half
the acreage have been rooted up be
cause of 'lack of demand for 5 the â¢ fruit.

SAN LUIS OBISPO, May 7.â The
present season in San Luis Obispo
County has been a peculiar, one from
the standpoint of climate and crops.
Taken 'altogether it is perhaps above
the average and much better than last
year. This county is largely devoted
to the dairy interests, and for the
dairymen. the season is splendid.
â¢ OUTPUT IX ORAXGE
COUXTY WILL XOT
BE UP TO AVERAGE
harvest throughout the county seems
â¢ assured- Last year there were no hay
and grain crops. This year the yield
will be good, though "not quite up to
expectations in some sections of the
county. Early grain is ripening, and
the last rains, which were needed. for
the late-sown grain, had a beneficial
effect. >
The cold weather has retarded veg
etation, yet the harvest will begin
within the next ten days or two weeks.
Both wheat and barley are heading
out well, and both have a fine healthy
stand. The ranchers declare that they
will have wheat and barley to ship
from here this fall. (
Raisin grapes will yield a big crop.-
The honey yield will be fair. Last
year it was a minus quantity, for not
only did the beÂ«s fail to keep busy, but
the owners were compelled to purchase
feed for their stands, move the bees to
some other county or State, or lose
them by starvation.- This year the bees
are making honey right along, . but
there are not as many of them as in
ISO 4.
Citrus-fruit conditions remain about
the same as a yeara"gro. Present prices
do not warrant much outlay, for pick
ing and packing. Shipments are not
numerous, and not more than half as
many persons are engaged in picking
and packing as in former years.

.VACAVILLE, May 7.â The general
fruit crop for 1905 Is estimated to be
god. The year's output probably
will reach the 1000-carload mark.
The . season oDened with 'a shipment
of cherries to the East on April 7.
three weeks . earlier than last . year.
The total number of carloads in 1904
was 555; in 1903, 1143.
Cherries will only yield about one
third of a crop. The early warm,
weather of. \ this year made the trees
too prolific and subsequent rain and
cold weather coming on suddenly
caused the pollin -to drop off; BlacJc
Tartarians: and Purple Guignes will bo
the leaders. The ,1904 croi> was con
sidered a full one.
The apricot crop will be large, much
larger than that of 1904. The late
rains of this season, were exceedingly
helpful to their, growth; Peaches arÂ»
expected to be plentiful, with the ex
ceptionof the earlier varieties and the
clings. Last year's 'crop was exceed
ingly light. The outlook for the plum
crop is good, with perhaps the excep
tion in Tragedies.
Prunes will be rather light, a quar
ter of a crop being estimated. La3t'
year's crop was heavy, but as the sea
son was more than three weeks late :"
and. the fall rains came on early, many
tons were lost on the drying racks.
. Pears are lighter than last year, but â¢
many, estimate from a quarter to half
a crop. â¢
Grapes, are expected to yield heavily/
VACAVILLE EXPECTS
TO SHIP 1000 CARS
OF FRUIT THIS YEAR
LOS AXGELES, May 7.â Not in eev
en years have crop conditions been bet
ter in this section of the State than at
present. After an unprecedented num
ber of consecutive seasons in which
the rainfall was far below the average,
this year there has not only been many
copious rains but they came at
intervals that yjfild . the greatest
good to the agriculturist. Of equal im
portance was their effect upon the ar
tesian plane. Continuous pumping from
year to year had lowered the level of
the artesian supply until how to get
sufficient water became a serious ques
tion in many localities. This season the
water is almost to its old level, the
many big reservoirs are nearly full and
the soil itself has been soaked* to an
unusual depth. . â¢ (
The result of the conditions makes
certain a season of prosperity for,- the
ranchers: The winter passed without
a killing frost and the fruit raisers ex
pect that next fall will be a record
breaking season for them. The acreage
planted to grain is \ larger than for
many years and the yield promises to
be far above the average. Agricultural
conditions throughout Southern Cali
fornia could hardly be better than they,
are.
BOUNTIFUL HARVEST
WILL BE REAPED BY
SAX DIEGO RANCHERS
NEWCASTLE. May 7.â From the
present outlook at Newcastle the sea
son of 1905 is to be a. favorable one to
the fruit producer. The output for
the year ISO 4 was about 700 carloads,
but for ISOS 1200 cars seems to be a
conservative estimate. The shipment
of cherries probably will be less than
one-half of last yearf The crop of
early peaches probably will be about
75 per cent of last season's crop. The
yield of midsummer and late peaches,
both freestones and clingstones, will
be five times greater than in ISO 4. Ap
ricots last year were very light, but
this season the reverse is the case.
Plums and prunes are short in some
varieties, some* early kinds showing
very short, but upon the whole the
crop will be a heavy one. Bartlett
and winter Xellis pears will be short
er than for many years. There will not
be one-Quarter of a full crop. The
yield of Beurre Ciairgeau and other
varieties will run from fair to heavy
crops, according to the present outlook.
Grapes are looking very well and
promise a good yield. % Orange trees
have been white with a profusion of
blossoms. At present they give prom
ise of good crops.
Japanese persimmons and olives bid
fair to be abundant.

RIO VISTA, May 7.â Crop conditions
in this section as compared with last
year : are about the 'same, taken as a
whole, but last year's crop was not
considered good. This year hay, wheat,"
barley, oats, >*â¢ etc,', -. are - good \ and the
crops expected to be heavy. Pasturage
is abundant in all sections.
Asparagus in this vicinity is excep
tionally good and the crop is very
heavy- : Growers are making large ship
ments daily. ' . -
Beans, have not been sown yet. Po
tatoes will yield the usual good crop.-
All kinds of vegetables will be good.
The alfalfa crop is excellent as usual.
The; crop of cherries, -peaches : and
pears will be about one- half the usual
size. Plums and prunes will . be light.*
Apricois undoubtedly will be 1 " the
heaviest* fruit ; crop. * . .
Grapes give indications of a good
crop, but they are not extensively
grown here.; :

NORMAN LOCKYER, president of the British Association
for the Advancement "of Science, in a recent address to the as-
S"^ sodatibn said: "Our position as a nation and our success as
merchants is in peril chiefly because of lour lack of' completely effi
cient universities, and our neglect of original research."
This condition he contrasts with the attention given to research
in the United States and Germany, and with the enormous endow
ments enjoyed by and German institutions of learning.
He puts over against this expenditure for brain power Great Brit
ain's enormous expenditure for sea power, and declares that brain
power is the sole or best reliance of a nation.
It seems to be conceded that development of brain power must
begin in the primary school system, fitting the mmd of, the. pupil
for. further advancement and development. Without this the higher
institutions of learning can do but little. The advantage held by
Americans is gained in the primary preparation for the original re
search which is promoted by the universities. Unless the material
is assorted, disciplined. and prepared for the higher instruction/ the
universities are powerless.- There are many ideas and many defi
nitions of brain power, and perhaps the best' is, that by Dr. -.\u25a0Jordan;'
that; it means knowing, that a straight line is the shortest 'distance,
between two points. It is probable that the nation having the most
people who know and apply that knowledge will in the long . run
prevail. over a larger nation with more people who do not know ivhat
that knowledge means.
But admitting, with Sir Norman Lockyer, that Great Britain is
behind the United States in brain power, what" was i the purpose) of

HARD-BOILED
EGG CHAMPION
Aside from cotton, crop indications are brilliant. The condi
tion of wheat is the best for years, and unless something happens
to the crop very soon the yield this year will be large. As the coun
try is largely dependent upon its crops for its prosperity, the out
look from this point of view is full of promise.
-5%> Beyond the conditions enumerated above there is nothing new
in trade. The current prosperity, which, with an occasional unim
portant lull, has been with \xs for seven years, shows no sign of col
lapse; The present era will go down into American political and in
dustrial history as one of the most remarkable epochs of good times
ever enjoyed by the nation.
But while legitimate .mercantile trade shows expansion, there
is contraction in certain quarters.. Thus the papers filed during
April in Eastern cities for companies 01 Si jooojooq or more capitali
zation had a total of $iB,iiixxx>, against $192,643x00 in March, ia
which month three companies alone filed papers amounting to more
than $100,000x00. This is an enormous shrinkage in new capitali
zation, though the flotations in March were obviously abnormal.
Evidently capita]_is pursuing a conservative course and not com
mitting itself very deeply to the exploitation of new enterprises.
Still, there have been huge flotations since the first of the year, it
being estimated that during this period new corporation bonds to
the amount of Ss so.oooxoo' have been floated and financed in Wall
.street. This is exclusive of the subscription to the Japanese bonds,
the big issue of New York City bonds and of many small companies
with issues of less than $1,000,000. Of course such an enormous flo
tation must come to an end some time, and perhaps that end has
come, which would explain the falling off in'ApriL
The staples continue to enjoy a large business, with profit mar
gins satisfactory. The wool trade continues active, with high quo
tations for the raw fleece still ruling. The cotton industry is
unsettled, owing to adverse weather in the cotton belt, which has
set the season back several weeks and rendered large operators and
manufacturers cautious. Provisions are quiet everywhere, though
quotations are maintained as a rule. Business in coffee continues
on a liberal scale. Hides and leather rule firm, with an excellent
export demand for the latter. Reports to the mercantile agencies
say that the building trades, which embrace lumber, hardware,
paints and glass, are "doing the business of their lives." But reports
from the iron and steel industry say that new business in this line is
falling off again, except in structural material, which is kept in
brisk demand by the widespread activity in building. Railway earn
ings in April wfc^e 10.5 per cent larger than in April, 1904.
failures last week Xveze 182, against 207 last year.
T AST week was another uneventful one in general trade. Ex
} pansion was still visible, however, as shown by the enormous
\u25a0\u25a0â / bank clearings, which amounted to $3^70,000,000, an increase
of 69 per cent over the corresponding: week last year. According to
the mercantile agency reports these figures have never been ex
ceeded bet once. It "must be borne in mind, however, that stock
-'â¢peculation in New York had a large share in this huge total, as the
pain at New York was 102.3 per cent- But there were other large
gains, such as 56.2 per cent at Philadelphia, 44^8 at Boston, 21.2 at
Pittsburg, 22.6 "at San Francisco, ?\.\ at St. Louis, and so on. Of
the ninety-five cities and towns reporting weekly clearings only six
teen showed a loss as compared with last year. Hence it Is a rea
sonable conclusion that the general business of the country, allow
:ng a certain percentage for the stock speculation in New York, was
at least 50 per cent larger than during the same week in 1904.
The continued abundance and ease in money is still attracting
attention. Nothing seems "to 'affect either condition. Enormous
liquidation in securities," breaks oÂ£ five or tea points in the country's
ttock market and the calling in of loans by the banks of the metropo
lis apparently do not alter the status of the money market. Month
after month the supply of ready cash all over the country continues
so large as to be unwieldy, and interest rates rule low. Once in I a
while a large failure occurs, but in a few days is forgotten. Now
and then there is a European call on us for gold, but rates do not
advance in consequence, and the vast hoards of money continue
10 grow. A gratifying feature of this unusual and almost unprece
dented condition is that the supply of money in_ Europe is appar
ently as large as in this country, and as long as both Europe and
the United States have their coffers fuil 'of gold there will be no
serious contraction of business, as contraction is usuaily caused by
a depletion in funds, which shortens credits, leads to price cuttings
in order to meet commercial obligations, and forces weak concerns
to the wall.

It is a . common * remark nowadays
that no one but a fool will start a new
building or a new Industry- and subject
himself to the tremendous losses, in
dignities and worry from the labor
unions. ...
.If â¢â¢â¢ these high-grade, men would
withdraw from the mismanaged bands
of outlaws and set up a union where
good was the test, and
then - offers their first-class labor at
even higher prices than common, with
their \u25a0 contracts made legally respon
sible, and if it became known that
when a buyer of labor didn't care 'to
purchase, this union would peaceably
offer " Its . labor elsewhere, but not "â¢ sro
bullying ' about v like a lot of . bandits
and lawbreakers, they would then
command the admiration and respect
of -the ' entire community, for^ people
like to see workmen prosperous. Ob
serve the high position in the minds of
the public that the Locomotive ; En
gineers ; hare won for: themselves by
just this plan of procedure/
Many and many a high grade man. is
an unwilling associate and member of
the anarchy- tainted unions, and he
seeks freedom somehow, somewhere.
, Help him:
It Is no insult to tell a man he Is In a'
place that stinks, he may know, and
deplore It, but if he defends the stink
ing place he insults himself.
CRIMINAL BRAND
So when you hear a union ; man de
nounce those who point. Â«mt the crimes
of the unions and seek to purify them
you may know to a certainty that he is
of the anarchist. "criminal type -and
squirms when the sunlight of publicity
Is turned upon him. Among this class
will ; be found the majority of labor
paper editors.
We should, demand of our public
officials that they proceed; as they did
In the beef trust : and give the people
protection from "this labor trust that
oppresses the common people more
than a dozen meat or oiltrusts. -V

PROCLAMATION OF FREEDOM
SAX JOSE, May 7.â While Santa
Clara Valley's fruit crop this year may
not be as heavy as usual, it is believed
that the net returns to the growers will
be about the same, as the prices will
be consistent with the sire of the croo.
The three main "fruits raised in the
valley are prunes, apricots and peaches.
The apricot crop will be a heavy one.
about three times as large as last year.
This fruit will be large and much clean
er and consequently will bring: a good
price. There will be a fair 'crop of
peaches. Just a little lighter than the
jield of last year. The crop of prunes
will be light. It will not exceed fifty
per cent of last year's crop, but as
there ls not much of a holdover of
this fruit, the prices will be much
stronger and the returns to the erower
probably will be the same as last year.
The cherry crop will be very light, not
more than one-tenth of what it was
last year. This is especially true of the
Royal Annes. Pears also will be lieht.
and badly spotted. The crop probably
will be about one-third the size of last
year's. Silver prunes will be very
light, and the yield about one-fourth
what it usually is. There will be a
good crop of the principal varieties of
grapes. Plums will be fair. '
The acreage devoted to garden seeds
In this county is about the same as
last year, and the crop will be of the
same dimensions. In some parts of the
valley the onions are affected by thrips
cr a blight, and may not be as produc
tive as last year. The asparagus crop
is reported about the same as last year.
The yield of hay and srrain will be
an average one, and equal to that of
1904. There will be plenty of hay. but
it will not be as clean as lasf year's.
and the quality will not be as eood. As
yet it is too early to tell what the croD
will be, as much that may now be in
tended for grain may be cut for hay.
There probably will be more barley
than hay thrashed this year.

. STOCKTON, May 7.â With a rainfall
for the season exceeding sixteen inches,
and with ;the " precipitation coming at
the most desirable periods, It follows
naturally that the general ' crop condi
tions of San Joaquin County should 1 be
very promising. The only concern at
lhÂ«i present time Ls over wheat in some
sections where it is feared that '; the
Hessian fly is responsible for a blight,
but elsewhere grain is advancing rap
idly and looks healthy. The - presence
of the fly is doubted, by many. "
There is a fair average of grain in
acreage, but truck farming on a whole
sale plan on the reclaimed lands is in
creasing in acreage, and. the onion and
potato crops doubtless, will be^ large.
The orchard section in Northern San
Joaquin never looked better, and the
vineyards are in satisfactory condition.
The showery spring has been free from
frost, and if this good fortune con
tinues unbroken both trees and vines
will yield a record crop. There will be
an increase In the grape yield, due to
maturing vines-
The weather and soil conditions have
been helpful to all classes of field hay,
and volunteer crops are above . the
average. An estimate on the grain
crop places it at a good average, and a
large increase in the products of tree,
vine and underground vegetables Is the
present Indication. ' >V*iBSSH

VINEYARD HAVEN. Mass!, May 7. !
The Joy line steamship^A\[ansas, : Cap^
tain Rood, was sunk : ; in collision with
the barge Glendower one and -'-one-half
miles I southeast >; of | the | Pollock .- Rip
Shoals i lightship at l:30; o'clock this
morning. â¢\u25a0: . One -life was "roat, that of
Mamie , Kelley, a passengers for New
York, from Boston, whose address^ is'
unknown. ;She -was \u25a0 about 25 years of
age. The', other passengers, ' of whom
there were j thirty-seven, | together with
the crew, numbering twenty-nine, were;
brought here by"a tug and landed at
midnight. /" ' . S ;
The collision was due to fog. . There
was no wind; stirring.; The Glendower,
one of a; tow, of ;;three: barges,? struck
the Aransas ' nearly jamidships;' on the
starboard side .'and-; the steamship went
down fifteen minutes later." "
The passengers were ' quickly awak
ened and j the bdats manned, | but .while _
all on board were 'going oveiÂ« the'slde
the tug which had the barges in tow
came alongside and* took \u25a0 off all with
' the ; exception of ' Miss . Kelley. Â£ Mate
Crocker said ihe \u25a0 .helped ;/ Miss Kelley
over the. side and when last; seen 'she
,v/as half j way ; down . the > ladder.
JVhether she lost her hold and fell into
the water, or in her fright climbed back
and went', down /with the steamship is
not known./ -' - J
The Aransas left Boston at 5:05
o'clock Saturday afternoon' and^ was
half way across the bay when a 'dense
fog set in. The steamship was: feeling
her way cautiously 'when,â .without: a
Warning and- immediately ahead,
barge was sighted. .= The steamship's
engines were \u25a0" reversed | and a frantic
but futile effort was made to 'avoid the
barge. * A moment later there "was a
crash and a huge hole was torn in the
starboard side of the steamship i op
posite the engines. - She filled rapidly
and there 1 was only time to. awaken the
passengers and get all overboard be
fore she went down! The barge was
practically uninjured. -The steamship
carried considerable freight.
The passengers, who lost practically,
all of their effects,- were ? landed here,
a distance of thirty- three: miles, from
the scene 'of the 'wreck. Among - the
rescued passengers a was. .Percy. Kea

ONE WOMAN LOST
V WITH THE^ESSEL
Weather Report.
The storm that swept the water front.
early ytsterday morning played havoc
with the shipping in: the bay. It not
only tore vessels at anchor from their
moorings and set them adrift, but it
also did serious damage to several
steamers that were lying alongside the
wharves. ' " Â»
â¢ From all reports it was the fiercest J
gale that has sp-ept the front for many 1
years. Waves dashed clear over Har- j
nson and Folsom street docks. â¢
The schooner Ruby, which was lying |
at. anchor in Mission Bay, was struck
by a heavy squall about 2 o'clock in
the morning, was forced away from
her moorings and driven straight down
toward Yerba Buena Island. The offi
cers of the Marblehead saw the craft
drifting down upon them. The- battle- â¢
ship promptly weighed ancbifrs and j
steamed out of the way of the drifting j
vessel. \u25a0 â¢â¢
The Ruby drifted down opposite }
Clay street, when her anchors fouled ;
with the telegraph cable, which brought j
her to a sudden standstill. There she i
retrained fast, until the tug Defiance (
came to her rescue, and after a hard j
struggle, succeeded in getting her f
anchors detached from the cable. She ,
was then towed back to her original j
anchorage. - ;
The torpedo-destroyer Paul Jones, j
which was lying in the stream, was |
struck by the gale and carried with a â¢
terrific smaen against the Marblehead, !
which was also lying at anchor in the I
stream. Several plates of the Marble- f
head were stove in by the' collision, j
The Paul ' Jones* bulwarks were j
smashed and in the mix-up one of her j
small boats .was carried away. . The
Paul Jones was later towed to anchor
age oil the Union Iron Works. â¢
The bay steamer Alviso underwent a
tough experience. She was lying along
side the Harrison-street wharf. Here
the storm seemed to reach its height.
Had the Alviso not been tied to; the
wharf she would certainly have turned j
turtle. As it was, she was so thrown j
about that her smokestack came down
with a craeh and fell over into the bay.
The fantail of her wheel -was smashed,
by beating up against the dock, her
. rails on the ' upper deck were torn
away, and the upper works in the bow.
were smashed.
The United States tug General Mif
flin is the worst damaged of any of
the craft that suffered by the storm.
She wa,s lying alongside the south end
of the transport dock when the steam
ship Eureka, which was loading on tlje
north, side of Folsom No. 2. was torn
away by the fury of the gale and was
borne down on the little Government
tug. The Eureka struck the stern of
the Miftiin with an awful crash. Just
at this moment Captain Hall managed
to get steam up on the Eureka and
backed her out into the stream, where
she came to anchorage and remained
until morning, when she came back
to her slip. The stern of the Mifflin
is badly smashed. Her stanchions
supporting the hurricane deck were !
tc-n away and twisted like pipestems- !
The upper deck, which is made of steel,
is knocked out of shape for twenty feet.
Her bulwarks are badly smashed. Her
damages are estimated at something
like $5000.
By collision with the Mifflin the bul
warks ,of the starboard side of the
Eureka' were smashed. \u25a0 Captain Hall,
commander of the Eureka, sars his 1
ship was tied up to the dock with two
heavy mooring cables, two big*hawsers
and a chain. The gale was so heavy
that all these snapped off lfke so many
pipestems. The damage to the Eureka
is about S5OO.
Notwithstanding the rough weather
yesterday on the water front, large
crowds went out to visit the United
States war vessels Chicago and Mar
blehead and the Italian cruiser Um
bria.. The bay was choppy and a brisk
breeze was blowing. This seemed to
add special zest to the trip to and from
the warships.
The launches of Crowley, Peterson.
MeNeill and Johnson were kept busy
in the service all the afternoon, crowd
ed with sightseers.

a day. specially designated for reflec
tionâfor "calm, generous reflection upon
; the vicissitudes of. .the nation and the
exalted- courage and devotion 'i of : i her
sons when her fate hung ?in the bal
ance.
It is this reflection that makes of Me
morial, day. a . factor . for characterr
growth and' which - lifts ' it above ; the
plane of a simple devotional day, with
a' sermon and the "garlanding 'of graves
with flags and' blossomsâ all \u25a0 of ; which,
of . course,- is very^ beautiful : and stimu
lating to patriotism. ;â But â it's I the ' re
flection that's the thing, ithe pondering
over the sacrifices and the heroisms of
the men who offered, up their lives for
their, nation's sake.
Now, patriotic reflection is not a like
ly product of a picnic, nor. Is a picnic a
seeming commemoration- of . the dead.
' .Who would -think of going on a picnic
on .the anniversary of the death i of ; a
loved one-? " Now, .the nation: makes of
the '3oth of May. tha anniversary of , the
death of her. loved onesâ then \u25a0 the
ethics that would prevail in; the; indi
vidual case should prevail: with the
other. -
And thus, in most of the dubs, ".'twist
now . and the dawning oorf r the ''day of
tears" resolutions will be offered
ing every clubwoman in the city to'dis
cburage, to the best of her, ability,, the
desecration of Memorial day, and to do
her part . in upholding, the sentiment
and the memories .of the day, for at ; no

REAL ESTATE TRANSACTIONS.
PENSIONS FOR THE AGED :yJ
CONSIDERED IX ILXIXOIS
TACOMA. May 7.â At the request of
the School Board, Principal Lancaster
of the Everett High School resigned
yesterday, following which Professor
Turner and Miss Hall also resigned.
Professor Lancaster is a lover of out
door sports and L has encouraged his
students to develop football and base
ball proficiency.
Several weeks ago the Everett foot
ball team played at Bellingham and
while there several members indulged
in wild actions. Knowledge of this was
kept from the Everett School Board
until last week. Members of the board
claim they should have been properly
notified. They accordingly asked Lan
caster to resign, after notifying him
that in the board's opinion he had been
making athletics too prominent.
Miss Hall resented the ignoring of
her opinion on the * selection of text
books. In resigning" she says: "The
majority- of the board seem to require
teachers with" no ideas. *1 thereforÂ©
think it best to preserve my own Indi
viduality and self-respect by resign
ing."

SPRINGFIELD. 111., May 7.â Tha
General Assembly came to a close early
this (Sunday) morning. The most sen- .
sational flght of the session occurred
over the bill legalizing Board of Trade
transactions, which came up for pass
age on the closing 1 night in the House.
The bill was "killed" during scenes of
excitement.
Local option became hopelessly en
tangled in both houses and finally was
allowed to "die" on the calendar. An
"anti-loan shark" bill, declaring void
all loans tainted with - usury and all
assignments ''of wages, in which the
assignment is not joined by the wife
or husband, was passed.
Joint resolutions were adopted pro
viding for the appointment of a com
mission to investigate the subject of
old age pensions and report to the
next Legislature and for investigating
the feasibility of a deep water channel
between the lake and the Mississippi.

Roach Strikes Out Eleven Men and
Webfooters Go to
Pieces.
SEATTLE. May 7.â Seattle won from
Portland to-day in a game that was
brilliant in spots, but stupid more often.
Portland went to pieces In the eighth.
after Bert Jones had succeeded Gar
vin, and loafed on almost every chance.
Kane's three-base drive that sent two
runs in came in this Inning and there
was no more hope left for. Portland.
The webfooters made it a farce for the
remainder of the inning. Portland tried
Mitchell again at first and the new
initial sacker looked everything but big
If ague material. Three throws from
Garvln. none of .them any too good
went through him and he bungled the
first sack work throughout, leaving the
bag uncovered once when Runkle had
a chance for an easy out. A high wind
that blew across the diamond during
the early part of the game made it al
most Impossible to Judge fly balls In
the xmtfleld and this accounts for some
of the liberal hitting In the early part
of the game. In the sixth inning, with
men on second and third, Skel Roach
struck out McLean. Runkle and Mlt
chel! In a row. The score:

TACOMA, May 7.â With Whalen
Â£t the helm the Seals started the
day by whitewashing the ' Cham
pions. "The Whale" was invinci
ble and the home team could not
bunch enough hits to squeeze in a run.
Keefe was found for four hits in the
first inning. Three errors were thrown
in and the Seals scored five. Fitz
gerald lasted the secona inning and
then Lynch held the Seals- down for six
rounds.
Conditions were reversed in the after
noon. In the first and third innings
Eagan made home runs, scoring five.
The crowd greeted him like a conquer
ing hero and a collection of more than
555 was taken up. Wilson cught three
Innings, but a foul tip injured a finger
and Shea succeeded him. Fitzpatrick
pitched a good game. The Seals first
scored on Hildebrand's pass, Irwin's
hit and an out. Two more came on
Corbett's pass. a stolen base, an out,
singles by Spencer and Wheeler and a
fielder's rhnfee. Corbett scored the last
en his two-baggar and Spencer's single.

I Native Daughters 'of ' the Golden
I West of Alameda and San Franoisco
counties held memorial services in Na
tive Sons* Hall yesterday for their de
parted sisters. The -hall â¢ was draped
in purple and white, with great fes-
I toons of evergreen. V "
One of the several features of the
solemn â¢ exercises was the . beautiful
"singing of the Knickerbocker. Quartet.
; These gentlemen ; rendered "Nearer,
My God. to Thee." "Lead. Kindly
;Light," and "Crossing the Bar" in , a"
manner that touched the hearts of the
mourning assemblage. \u25a0
The sentiment* of the . services .was
\u25a0expressed 'in . the ; appropriate opening
address by Miss Mary.Dempsey, .which
was as follows: 1 .
To-day wherever there Is a parlor of Native
Daughters of thÂ« Golden West In Calif crnla
~ there is assembled the memDershlp thereof for
the purpose of performing: a sad . and solemn
duty toward the memory of the deceased sisters
of our order. "
We gather to-day In sorrow, to pay tribute
to the memory of .those whom an all wise prov
idence deemed it" best should so. '
Whlln we all realize that' sooner or later
we must all make the Journey across the
mystic river, yet, when ; that time . comes we
cannot easily reconcile . ourselves to that sor
row, \u25a0 yet .we have the assurance that ; they
are not dead, but gone before, and may we
not take comfort; then In the hope that those
loved ones are waiting: for us In the summer
land of that other world? . \u25a0. '\u25a0
The hand of ' Death has â been laid .heavily
on our beloved order during: the last year, and
the realization of these visits from the reaper
and the loss of our dear friends calls- for 'our
contemplation of : another life, toward which
we. are all drifting-, and reminds us that the'
' closer . living up 'to the standards \u25a0â and ideals
of ' the . principles and \u25a0 teachings of the Native
; Daughters of the Golden West all the better
prepares us to s meet the . change, too. when
our summons comes. y- - . â

ployed with Mur^dock & Co. Allen said
that McPhail had not been drinking
for about three months. When he
was under the influence of liquor he
was in the habit of saying he would
like to end his life. It is supposed that
he had taken poison while under the
influence of liquor, as the bartender
and Policeman Savage both said he
showed evidence of having been drink
ing heavily. Dr. Giannlnl made an au
topsy and will send the stomach to the
City Chemist for analysis.. McPhail

served for- Emmett' Corrigan, who re
' appeared fafterj an absence of months
in " his unique skit, "Jv ;key Jones."

that lean to the sensational are not less
pleased- as the -race that concludes the

Miss Florence Stone and the Ferris \u25a0
stock company began the third, week
of. their successful engagement at the
Grand \u25a0 yesterday, . with
Fanny Davenport's "Joan of Arc" as
the attraction.: The old play, that Miss
Davenport built her" hopes on. has lost
none' of Its vigor, and with Miss Stone
as the maid of Orleans and A. Byron
Beasley as" Client, the jester, delighted
a large audience.
The work of the company is worthy
of the;. highest commendation, for the
manuscript of the play did hot; arrive
until the middle of the week," and al
most constant rehearsing has been the
company's portion. The strain told on
Miss Stone in the last .act, but with a
day's rest she will be magnificent in
the ' part. " From thetlme Joan of Arc
enters until the: final scene she holds
the audience wrapped up : in her for
tunes. This,, Interest is shared by
ClichetÂ» which " Is" exceptionally well
played by Mr. Beasley. . ' .
The villain was rather colorlessly
filled by Frank Sheridan, while the rest
of: the characters are merely puppets
! used to teir the meteoric career of the
I martyr maid. * The performance is well
;. worth seeing, andi a good business for
;the t week is j confidently anticipated by
the management. â- '
'It^ isj :. expected, that witnin the; next
fewj daiys ;the shakeup in" '.'the 'upper,
office" foretold '.when Chief Dinan was
appointed will be carried into effect.
The vacancy in the. staff >of .detective
sergeants caused by Chief Dinah's pro
motion will be filled, but the lucky man
will not, it |is said, -. be. Poljee Commis
sioner. Reagan's -son/ Those promi
nently mentioned ,as likely, to get the'
plum among -the' special duty men are
Steve Bunner, Charles H. : Taylor and
John,B. Freel.
Bunner and \ Freel ' used; to work to
gether till Freel was returned to street
duty a .t ew '% months ago oy . ex-Chief
Wittman. .The new Chief believes that
an injustice was dbnex Freel and for
the last two or three weeks Freel ; has
been, on special duty. ;He and Bunner
did some excellent work together.
Since Bunner lost E Freel as a partner
he ; and -Duncan . Matheson have been
partners and have made - several clever
captures.' Taylor has been associated
with Detective^ Sergeant Ryan and has
proved- energetic, and successful. '-
.Chief Dinan knows the fitness of each
man, for detective work and it is said
that he is not satisfied with" the work
of some .who now occupy the positions
of detective sergeants. It" is probable
that a; few changes will be made, as
the power! lies, in /the hands of -.the
Chief. â¢ Some of the detective sergeants
are on the ] anxious seat. Some ' special
duty, men .who "were appointed by ex-
Chief Wittman. will also, it is said, be
put back to street duty and their places
filled by men' now doing street duty.

. "Their virtues we shall always treas
ure," "Their faults we have forsrotten."
These sentiments worked with blue
-flowers on the; white faces of two ble
floral shields that stood at each;side
of the stage, faced the large audience
that gathered at the annual -memorial
services of San Francisco and Golden
Gate Aeries of Eagles at the Alhambra
Theater yesterday afternoon. The bis
playhouse was filled with membef s and
friends of the order. The ceremonies
were beautiful. A j programme of Un
usual excellence was rendered. Amone
the speakers were Mayor Schmitz and !
Congressman :Kahn, both members. â¢!
The decorations were" striking. There |
was a splendid floral display on the ;
stage, and around the balcony front!
extended red, white and blue buntine. ;
looped up at intervals by white papier
mache eagles. Several large stuffed
eagles with extended wings" were per- i
ched at various places on the stage. . j
' One of the solemn >nd impressive j
features of the programme was the
calling of the roll of the dead by Secre
tary Gustave Pohlmann of the memor
ial committee. Each name was called
twice and for each name a deep-toned
bell responded in token of the fact that
the brother had departed. " ii
Mayor Schmitz in his address said"
the. annual memorial services of the
Eagles were milestones of peace on the*
rugged road of the strenuous life that
was for those remaining. They lifted
those who attended from the valley of
turmoil and struggle to a" higher: at
mosphere and aroused higher ideals
and ambitions. No man who had the
better things In his. nature could "say
that the services for the dead were not
a benefit to the living. As the memory
of each that had departed was recalled
his. brothers remembered his virtues
and forgave his faults which. were ex
alted and softened.
Congressman Kahn delivered a beau
tiful eulogy on those who had passed
I to the beyond. '
