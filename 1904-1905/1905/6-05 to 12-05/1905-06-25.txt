He bad been doing this as a "side

years he was winning his competency,
for a life of mere rrioney-gf ttlng would

Luther Burbank'o. life. It ;Is; such i a
revelation \u25a0 .'of the â¢ real i manâ of *' the
Btrength and : patience and 'loyalty,; that
lies tmdrr" that- gentle, shy."sunpreten

Well, the list 1b long; and there must
be room t<ii other things' in .The Sunday
Call, so tlii* one thing as a sample of
what he has done for California must
suffice.
He msde a successful experiment in
prnne growingâ he produced the giant
prune from the French prune and the
sugar prune, with the rcEult that one
California townâ Vacavlllcâ was literally
built by prunes, owes its existence to
prune growing:, and the California prune
has a reputation to be proud of wherever
it E*es.
With a. wonderful singleness " an.d
cteadfartneES of purpose he has done
th**e things.
Thirty years ago, when he was little
more than.'a boy, he came here from his
native bleak New England, and already
fcls high purpose was denned, 'his work
lay clear before him. , '
He came equipped for the battle of
life with Just ten of his 'Burbank po
tatoes â and brains. ...
Kor fifteen ..years .-he followed the
-business of nurseryman, and with much
eucce**, for he is a practical man as
well qf a dreamer of golden dreams.
There was never a day. of those fifteen*
years when- he '.forgot his. resolve or
swerved from h!6 purpose, which was
to win the financial freedom to give all
his tlniÂ« and thought to his experi
ments in plant training:, in plant edu
cation, 'n, plant evolution. Ij. came at
the end of the fifteen' years and he set
tled down in his pleasant,, modest home
at Santa. Kosa, no longer to multiply
and I distribute . the f ruijts and flowers
and "trees and vegetables that already
existed," but to create new arid "better
forms. " ' "/ \u25a0â¢/''
For California he has doneâ
He has brought her outcasts into the
fold, -her aristocrats to usefulness and
made, as it"' were, gqod citizens out of
plant Pirates, civilizing arid taming and
Eub<juing the dangerous/ and . predatory
and umcccnerate of plant life...
trees and vines, won ilcher gifts of fruits
and flowers, vegetables, grains and huts.
In hit- laÃcratofy garden he has done
for Nature in part of one man's lifetime
what Nature .couldn't do for herself in
thousands and thousands of years.

OF the various robberies In which
tre were both concerned, it Is but
the few, I find, that will bear tell
ing at any length. Not that the
others contained details which
even I would hesitate to recount; it is.
rather, the very absence of untoward in
cident which renders them useless for my
present purpose. In point of fact our
planÂ» were so craftily laid (by Raffles)
that the chances of a hitch were invari
ably reduced to a minimum before we
went to work. We might be disappointed
In the market value of our haul; but it
was quite the exception for us to find
ourselves confronted by unforeseen im
pediments, or involved In a really dra
matic dilemma. There was a sameness
even in our spoil; for, of course, only the
most precious stones are worth the trou
ble we took and the risks we ran. In
short, our most puccessful escapades
would prove the greatest weariness of all
in narrative form; and none more so
than the dull affair of the Ardagh em
eralds, some eight>or nine weeks after
the Milchester cricket week. The former,
however, had a sequel that I would rather
forget than all our burglaries put to
gether.
It was the evening after our return
from Ireland, and I was waiting at my
rooms for Raffles, who had gone off as
usual to dispose of the plunder. Raffles
had his own method of conducting this
very vital branch of our business, which
I was well content to leave entirely in
hi.* hard?. He drove the bargains, I be
lieve, in a thin but subtle disruise of the
flaEhy-: .edy order, and always in the
Cockney dialect, of which V.c had made
himself a master. Moreover, ho invari
ably employed the same "â¢fence," who
\u25a0was ostensibly a money-lender in a small
<but yrt notorious) way, and in reality
a rascal as remarkable as Raffles him
self. Orly lately' 1 also had been to the
xnan. but in my proper person. We had
needed capital for the getting of these
very emeralds, and I had raised Â£100 on
the terms ycu would expect, from a soft-
Ejxiken graybeard with an ingratiating
smile, an incessant bow. and the shift
iest old eyes that tver flew from rim to
lira of a pair of spectacles. Â£0 the orig
inal sinews and the final spoils of war
came in this case from the self-same
sourceâ a circumstance which appealed , to
us both.
But these same final spoils I was
still to see, and I waited and waited
w\J.h an impatience that grew .upon
me with the growing dusk. At my
open window I had played Sister. Ann
until the faces in the street below
were no longer distinguishable. And
now I was tearing to and fro in the
grip of horrible hypotheses â a grip
that tightened when at last the lift
gates opened with a clatter outside â
that held me breathless until a well
known tattoo followed on my door.
"In the dark!" said Raffles as I drag
ged him in. "Why, - Bunny, what's
\u25a0wremg?"
' "Nothingâ now you've come," said I.
shutting the door behind him in a
fever of relief and anxiety. "Well? Well?
What did they fetch?"
"Five tiundred."
"Got it in my pocket
"Good man:" I cried. "You don't
know what a stew I've been â¢ in. I'll
switch on the light. I've been think
ing of you and nothing else for the
last hour. IâlI â I was ass enough to
think something bad gone wrong."
Raffles was smiling when the white
light filled the room, but for the mo
ment I did not perceive the peculiarity
of his smile. I was fatuously full of
my own late tremors and present re
lief; and my first idiotic act was to
spill some whisky and squirt the soda
\u25a0water all over in my anxiety to do in
stant Justice to the occasion.
"So you thought something had hap
pened?" said Raffles, leaning back in
my chair as he lit a cigarette, and look
ing much amused. "What should you
say if something had? Sit tight, my
dear chap! It was nothing of the
slightest consequence, and it's all over
now. A stern chase and a long one,
Bunny, but I think I'm well to wind
ward this time."
And suddenly I saw that his collar
v,-as limp, his hair matted, his boots
thick with dust. 1
"The police?" I whispered aghast.
"Oh, dear, no; only old Baird."
"Baird! But wasn't It Baird who
took the emeralds?"
"It was."
knife. I did my best to get out. of/itâ ;
swore I had a pall who was a real swell
but I saw very plainly that I had given
myself away. He gave up haggling. He
paid my price as though he enjoyed doing
it. But I felt him following me. "when. l
made tracks, though, of course, I didn't
turn round to see."
"Why not"
"My dear Bunny, it's the very worst
thing you can do. As long as you look
unsuspecting they'll keep their distance; \u25a0
and so long as they keep their distance
you. stand a chance. Once show that you
know you're being followed and it's flight
or fight for all you're worth. I never,
even looked round; and, mind you, never \u25a0
do in the same hole. I just hurried up to-;
Blackfrtars and booked for High street,
Kensington; at the top of my voice, and
as the train was leaving Sloan square
out I hopped and up all those stairs like
a lamplighter and round to the studio by
the back streets. Well, to be on the safe
side I lay low there all the afternoon,
hearing nothing in the least suspicious
and only wishing I had a window to look
through instead of that beastly skylight.
However, the coast seemed clear enough,
and thus far it was my mere idea that
he would follow me; there was nothing
to show he had. So at last Imarched out
in my proper rigâ almost straight " into
old Baird's arms!"
"What on earth did you do?"
"Walked past him as though I had nev
er set eyes on him in my life, and- didn't
then; took a hansom in the King's road
and drove like the deuce to Clapham
Junction; rushed on to the nearest plat
form without a ticket, jumped into the
first train I saw, got out at Twickenham,
walked full tilt back to Richmond, took
the District to Charing Cross and here I
am! Ready for a tub and a change and
the best dinner the. club can give us. 1
came to you first because I thought you
might be getting anxious. Come round
with me^ind I won't keep you long."
"You're certain you've given him the
clip?" I said, as we put on our hats.
"Certain enough, but we can make as
surance doubly sure," said Raffles, and
went to my window, where he stood for
a minute or two looking down into the
street.
"All right?" I afked him. "
"All right," said he, and we went down
stairs forthwith and so to the Albany
arm in arm. . - - .
But we were both rather silent on the
way. I, for my part, was wondering
what Raffles would do about the studio
in Chelsea, whither at all events he had
been successfully dogged. To me the
point seemed one of immediate import
ance, but when I mentioned it he . said
there was time enough to think about
that. His one other remark was made
after, we had nodded (in Bond street) to a
young blood of our acquaintance who
happened to be getting himself a bad
name.
"Poor Jack Rutter!" said Raffles with
a sigh. "Nothing's sadder than to see a
fellow going to the bad like that. He's
about mad â¢ with drink and debt, poor
devil! Did you see his eyer Odd that we
should have met him to-night, by the
way; it's old Baird who's said to have
skinned him. By God, but -I'd like to
skin old BairJ!'
And his tone took .a, sudden low fury,
made the more noticeable by , another
long silence which lasted, indeed, through
out an admirable dinner at the club and
for some time after we hirti settled down
in a quiet corner of the smoking-room'
with our coffee and. cigars. : Then "at; last.
I saw Raffles looking at me with his lazy'
smile and. I knew that the morose j fit
was at an end.
"I dare say yon .wonder .what I've been
thinking about all : this .time?" said he. -
"I've. been .thinking "what 'rot it is to go
doing things by. halves!"
"Well," eaid I. returning his smile,
"that's not a chargethat you can bringy
against yourself, .is* it?"v .$ ". );"
"I'm not so sure," said Raffles, blow r
ing a meditative puff; Vas a matter of
fact, I was thinking less of myself than
of that poor devil of" a Jack . Rutter.'
There's a fellow who docs things by
halves; he's only "half gone to the, bad.
and look at the difference between him
and us! He's under the thumb of a vil
lainous money-lender; we'are solvent cit
izens. He's -taken to drink; : we're as
sober as we are solvent- His pals are
beginning to cut him; our difficulty is to
keep the pals from the door. Enfin, he
begs or borrows, which is stealing by
halves, and we steal outright and are .
done with it. Obviously ours is the. more,
honest course.- Yet I'm not' sure, Bunny,
but we're doing the thing -by halves our
selves!"
"Why? What more could we do?'\ I .
exclaimed in soft derision, locking/
round, however, , to : make sure that we
were not overheard. ' , r
"What more?" said Raffles.- "Welli I
murder â for one thing." '
"Rot!"
"A matter of opinion, my dear.Bun
ny; - 1 don't mean . It f or . rot. I' ye . told \
you before that the biggest. man, alive.
iA the man who's [committed a murder^
and- not yet. been found .out; '. at', least
he ought to be, but he so very seldom
has thesoul to appreciate himself. ; - Just
think of it! Think of coming , In > here"
arid talking to the men, very likely
about the murder Itself, and ; knowing :
you've done it/ and wondering how] they'd ;
look. if they knew." 6h.it would be great,
simply great! But, besides all '4 that;.:
when you ,were caught "here^d;: be. : : . â¢&\u25a0/.
merciful 'and dramatic f end of you. ; You'd '. â¢
fill; the bill 1 , for a .^feV "weeks and; then
snuff but .with a flourish of extra'spef
cials; you wouldn't rust with a , vile
repose for seven or fourteen' years." ; ,
"Good, old - Raffles!" '; 1 1 chuckled. "I .
begin 'j to ; forgive you for being ' In . bad
form, at ; dinner.'*
"But 1^ was never more ; earnest in
my. life." '
â¢ "GO'On!'.' . \u25a0 ;
"I mean it"
'.'You' know very -well that . you
;. "Done ? v .What have I done?" Tha
unhappy .wretch came out Into the light
with bloodshot., blinking eyes,' and a
bloody shirt front. "You knowâ you've
seenâ but; I'll tell you -it you like. I've
killed a robber; that's all: -I've 'killed
a robber, a usurer, a jackal, a black
mailer, the cleverest and the cruelesl
> villain unhung. Â« I'nr ready to hang for
him. I'd kill him again!"
And he looked us fiercely In the face,
a' fine defiance In his dissipated eyes;
his' breast heaving, his jaw like a rock.
:"Shall I tell 'you' how it : happened?"
he went â¢ passionately on. "He's mada
my life a hell these weeks and months
past. You may know that. A perfect
hell! Well., to-night I met him, ln Bond
street. Do you remember^ when I met
you fellows? He wasn't twenty yards
behind you; he was on your tracks.
Baffles: he, saw me nod to you," and
stopped me and asked me who you
were. He seemed as keen as knives to
know. I couldn't think why, and didn't
care, either. '. for I saw my chance. I
said I'd tell him all about you If he'd,
give me a private Interview. He said
he wouldn't. I said he would, and held
him by the coat: by the time I let him
'go you were out of sight, and I waited
where I was till he came back in de
spair. * I had." the whlo hand on him
then. I would dictate where the in
terview should be. and I made him take
me" home with . him, still swearing to
tell him all about you when we'd had
our : talk. â¢ Well, when w got here I
made .him give me something 1 to eat.
putting him off , and off: and about .10
o'clock I heard the gate shut. I waited*
a bit and tlien asked him if he lived
alone. ..
L '"Not at- all,* says he: 'did you not
see the ' servant?* ;
"I said I'd seen her, but Â« l thought I'd
heard her go: If I was mistaken no doubt
she would come when she was called;
and I yelled three times at the top of my
voice. Of course . there was no servant
to come. I knew that, because I cams
to see him one night last ' week. ' and ha
Interviewed me himself through the gate,
but wouldn't open it. Well.' when I had
done yelling, and :' not a soul had come
near us â¢ he was ; as â¢ white as that ceil
ing. Then I told ; him we could have our
chat at last: and I picked .the poker out
of the fender,' and told , him ' how ' he'd
robbed â¢' me.' but by God he shouldn't rob
me any, more. 1 1 gave him three minutes
to write and sign a" settlement of all - his
iniquitous claims against me, or have hia
brains beaten' out over his own carpet.
He thought a minute. and ; then went " to
his desk for pen and paper. In two sec
onds she was round : like â¢ lightning with
a , re vol ver ' arid I went : for him bald
headed. He fired two or. three times and
missed; you can find the holes If you like;
but I hit him every timeâ ray Godt I was
like a savage till the thins was done.
And then I didn't care. I went through
his desk looking for my. own bills, and
was coming away when you turned up.
I ; said. l didn't care, nor do- 1; out I was
going, to give myself up to-night, and
shall still; so you see I shan't give you
fellows much trouble!" â
He. was done, and there we stood on
the landing of the lonejy bouse,' the low.
thick; eager voice- still raging and ting
ing through our ears; the dead man be
low^ and in .front of us nis
slayer. â¢ I knew to whom, the impenitence
-would- appeal when he had heard" the
story, and I was not mistaken.
''That's all rot," ' said Raffles, speaking
after, a pause; "we shan't let ..you give
yourself : up."
"You shan't stop me! x What would be
the good? The woman. saw me: it would
only be a question of time, and. I can't
face. waiting to be taken. Think of it:
waiting â¢ for them to touch you on , the
shoulder! No. no. no. I'll give myself up
and set.it over."
His speech was changed; he faltered,
floundered. It was as though a clearer
perception of his, position had come with
the bare idea of. escape from it.
"But listen to me," urged .Raffles;
"we're here at our- peril ourselves. We
broke in like thieves to enforce redress
for a grievance very like your own. But
don't you see?. We took out a paneâ did
the thing like regular burglars. Regular
burglars will get the credit of all the
rest!"
, "You mean that I shan't; be suspected?'*
"I do."
"But I don't want to get off scot free."
cried < RuUer. hysterically. Â« "I've > killed
him. I know that. But it was in self
defense; it â¢ wasn't murder. I must own
up and take the consequences. I shall so
mad if I don't!"
His hands twitched; his lips quivered;
the tears were in his eyes. : Raffles took
him roughly by the shoulder.
"Look here, you fool! If ."the. three 'of
us were caught here . now. do you know
what* the consequences would be? "We
â¢ should swing in a row at Newgate in six
weeks-t ime! You talk as though we
were sitting in a club; don't you -know
it's 1 - o'clock in the . morning, and the.
lights on.; and a dead man down below?
For God's sake, pull yourself together
and do what I tell you, or you're a dead
man yourself.", , ' J '.\
"I wish I was one," Rutter sobbed.. "I
.wish- 1 had his revolver 'to blow my own
brains out. It's lying underhim.. On. my
God. -my God!" -
His knees knocked together; the frenzy
of . reaction was at Its " height. We had;
to take ', him . downstairs between us, , and
so through . the . front door and out into
the open air.
; All was still outsideâ all but the smoth
ered * weeping of the unstrung â¢'_ wretch
"upon our hands/ ' Raffles returned for . a
moment to -the, house; then all was dark
as well. The gate opened from within ;
we closed it carefully " behind us. 'and so
left the starlight shining on broken glaÂ«s
and polished spikes," one and all. as we
had found them. -
'We escaped; v no need to dwell on" our
escape. Our; murderer; seemed \u25a0 set ; upon
the scaffoldâ drunk with his deed, he was
more trouble than six .men drunk with
wine.' Again and again â¢we " threatened
to â¢ leave" him to his _ fate, ' to wash ; our
hands of him. But Incredible and unmer

If He Were a Chief of Police.
Speaking of the police, live had con
siderable to do with them in all parts
of the country. The ordinary "cop" is
all Tight. He has a family, lives de
, cently and tries to-keep clean. There's
a lot of. chances to take in their trade,
but- the "cops" take them all and they
don't expect bouquets from the gallery,
and sure they don't get many, perhaps,
an occasional , one with a rock in It or^
a string ta. it.
When the reformers, who will never
: understand that policemen are not Sun
day school teachersâ they wouldn't be
" police officers if they, were â get after

\u25a0'they: are grafters and compel them to

cities I, could name that areas well off.

Hogon of Providence j Knocked. Him
- ** -â . -- _\u25a0 Down. â¢V W. : ""
In some of the obituary notices writ
ten of .me it was stated 'that the only
time in my career that I was knocked
down was in. my battle with Mitchell.
I went dowiTin "that flght.-but I. wasn't
knocked down.' We fought in! the rain
and It was so. cold I was chilled. While
stepping* backward I got a push from
Charlie. I went over ju3t : as a brick
balanced on edge would* goT.over when
shoved ever "so little. Afterward I of
fered to bet a . thousand dollars , that I
could stand square on my feet, with my
hands tied behind, my* back dad let
Mitchell hit me a dozen times without
getting floored. That bet neevef was
taken, even if It does look* like easy
money to-day. But, l did get knocked
down once. I'll tell how it .happened.
and it will be the first time it has been
in print. When I was new at the busi
ness and known as the- "Boston Strong
Boy," I went to Providence.- R: Li to
battle with Jack Hogan of that good
town. We met in the old Theater
Comlque. â¢ Hogan was .a blacksmith.,
who had trained on clambakes^-by the
way. Providence beats 'the world* oa
clam dinners^-and he hard and
husky as nails. " '\u25a0> * \u25a0Â«
\u25a0J: I, wanted to catch a train*, so- i opened
onj.Hogah with a rush. . He stood
stock still in the middle of \the stage

stovepipe and as hard^as abungstart

into that splendid bit of flst, Down I
went kerflop.; But I was up, before
you could guess and was ai; Hogan -like
the big wind. The fighting was finished
for Hogan right off the reel.
M Who pulled the roof .down on me?'*
Hogan asked when he came: out of it
later in the evening. I. â¢
Jack Hogan of Providence was one

Round*â John Snyii He Made (he
Ring; Better Than He Found It, Even
if His Hind Lees Were Too Short.
WHEN I think of the' good friends
rf mine v.-ho have gone it
makes me wonder that I am
Etill in the game. One of the
; j earliest friends I had was good
old M!ke Gleasori. He was one of the
first to Eec that I had the punch, but he
held me back when I wanted to show
tLem. Mike* did push me to the front,
but not es fast as I wanted to go. I was
daffy to get a crack at Paddy Ryan when
2 wes a gossoon around Boston. Hearing
that Paddy was to give an exhibition in
Lowell shortly after he had walloped Joe
Goss and got the championship, I struck
Mike to take me to LowelL -
At thai time I had made good headway
tit the boxing trade without letting it cut
cut my other trade or laying bricks on
top of one another in mortar sandwiches,
and I was sure enough that my time had
come to make good with the clout.. Mike
gave me the laugh when 1 asked him. to
take me to Lowell so I could put a chal
lenge right up to Ryan, the champion, co
that he couldn't dodge it.
"Jawn," said Mike, "you're going to
ccrne along, but take it aisy. take it aisy.
In a year or co you'll be aole to get a
hearing from Paddy, but you haven't had
the experience. If you go at him now
he'll knock your head off."
Throw* His Dinner Pall Up an Alley*
So I went back into my hole, but not
very far. The evening that Ryan was to
chow la Lowell I was going hÂ«--ne from
work when -I met a fellow named Mc-
Carthy. Telling him, how bughouse I was
to get at Paddy, he cut in with:
"I believe you can lick him, John, and
if it's money you want I've got enough.
We've got just time to catch a train for
Lowell. Come on and we'll take the wind
cut of Paddy"s sails."
I was fa my working clothes, my dinner
pail in my hand. Chucking the dinner
pail up in an alley we made a break for
the train. When Paddy came on the
stage I stood up and challenged him.
Just what Ryan said I don't remember
exactly, but it was something like "go and
get a reputation." Whether he had heard
of me or not and didn't want any of, the
game of the "Boston Strong Boy" I don't
know, but I was shoved away. But in a
tern months I had reputation enough and
Paddy, when we got together, :-liyed to
tell the tale that the punch I gave him
was enough to kill an ordinary ox.
A Fair Fight Strengthens Friendship.
When I was matched to fight . Ryan
much of my stake money was;.put'up by
Glcumj!) and Jim Keenan. Ryan's father
and Gleason's father both came from Tip
perary, and Mike has a soft spot in his
heart for Paddy, although aVgood true
friend of mine. During the fight" l- .noticed
my man Gleason hob-n<sbDing*'. witn
Ryan's friends on the other side of the
i ing. When Paddy had been counted out
1 arcused Gleason of going into the Ryan
ranks. He was dumb for a minute; much
surprised that I should think his action
strange. , :\u25a0\u25a0. 'Â» :
"You know how I feel toward : you,
John," he said when he'd got over his
surprise enough to talk, "and you know
\u25a0where my money was, but on account
of the oil man, a towney of mine,' I
tlought I ought to show him that a little
thing like this shouldn't come between
ir Â«.r.ds." . >â¢
>lfke was one of the few men who
could go through a rough-house experi
ence and retain the good will of all sides.
He- was- just, as good a friend lbfÂ« the
Ryans while betting on me to put Paddy
into dreamland as he was to all my sup
porters. He couldn't understand why
there should be any hard feelings after.
a fair fight, for to his way of thinking
a nice fight was the surest means of put*
ting a Icadpipe cinch on friendship. . i"
Ryan and myself sat in Gleason's cafe
in Court. street the Sunday night after
that fight and the crowd that came to see
us filled the street from building toibuild
ing, so that the cars couldn't get through
for several hours.
The Passing: of an Old Friend.
Gleason was near me in all my fights
except the one with Kilrain. Business
troubles kept him from that. Toward the
end he became unbalanced and was sev
eral months In an asylum before I was
told of it, being on the road at the time.
I paid a handful of money to get poor
Mike out from behind the bars, thinking
to bring him around with good company.
I took him to Muldoon's place, where
I was going to train. But Mike was
changed. He failed, grew unreasonable
and after a few weeks went back .to
Boston without giving any of us warn
ing-. .'He didn't last long after that,
dying In the asylum." â¢
"If the people that Mike Gleason had
befriended had followed his body to
the cemetery he would have had tho
largest funeral ever seen in Boston,"
Eaid Captain Cooke in the Police News.
Mike was one of my earliest and
steadiest friends. I hope he. is happy,
and I think he Is. Such men are not
handed down in history as patterns,
but they do. a lot more good than slick
er chaps who wouldn't. sit on the same
eeat with 'liim. I'm proud of Mike
Gleason's friendship for me, glad that
1 was able to stay with him when he
needed a friend, and I know hV is
where the true men go' when they, die.
He bad the Irish love of a fair fight,
he liked men -who could fight, but. he
â¢was to tender-hearted, that he would
give up to every victim of hard 'luck.
.He was glad to make money so as to
have it. to give away ~~ r where i,t was
needed, and his heart i beat as warmly *3
for the Fourth ofiJuiy as it. did for
St. Patrick's day. V\
Trnsli-jr Ktlraln Seventy-Five Rounds.
In .my last letter I promised to tell
more of tho battle with Kilrain. I want
to hark back to that scrap to show
that at that time. Kixteen years ago,
when I was undisputed champion of the
world, the same yarns were told of me
that you Â«cc in newspapersâ that 1 was
all In: that I couldn't stand up half an
hour and so on. â¢ ' ' â¢
One sing-song In some of the paperÃ
at that time was that I would quit ir
any man could stand me off, iny hur
ricane rushes. That always made Â«ne
sore to the' bone, but I neve.r,let on
that it even, reached , me. .\ So: I made

worse and finished him quicker, but I had

most anything. But folks forget, espe

' tCvpyriShted. 1905. by Oi>le Read.)
THE young
minis tcr
was the presi
dent of the E!ec
tlc Society. He had brought
the " word with him into the
neighborhood. It had a good
sound, was well suited to- an intel
lectual movement, and was adopted by a
vote of 2C to 3. Old Brlz had held out
against its adoption. He paid that while
not exactly opposed to it, he thought
that in a matter of such importance they
n-.ipht to po slow. But when convinced
that it diJ not favor one religious de
iioi.t::iatiijn more than another he agreed
to adopt the name. One of the first
questions discussed by the society was
sympathy. The young minister read a
paper and then called for "views." No
one offered to anything. "Ah, Brother
Juck'nn, haven't you, out of your rich
fund of experience, a few words for us?"
the young preacher inquired.
"Well," said old Urn. "I- don't know
that I can add anything. I don't think
we have gone at the discussion part ex
actly right. I'll illustrate. I recollect
once that after the death of a member
of our lodge a passle of us met to say
pleasant things about him. \u25a0 And, sittin'
about in an informal way, every one was
free and interestin' in his talk. A hun
dred little incidents were called- up, show-
Ing that Brother Jackson had been. a good
and tender-hearted man. But as soon as
the gavel fell and called the meetlri' to
order embarrassment sealed the lips of
every one that got up and attempted to
talk. And so it is now. We can sit
around and talk about the subject of
sympathy, and some, of us might find . a
good thing lyin' hidden away. But if we
get up and address the meetln', why. we
are embarrassed.- But I reckon it's true,
as you cay, that it's sympathy that really
rules the world. Man gives away In sym
pathy what he gathers together, in self
ishness. War is a horrible thing. and. its
conception may be the selfishness; of the
few, but after all the force and. the sweep
in' power of it is the sympathy of. the
many. It was sympathy that brought on
the Spanish war."
"What do you understand as sympa
thy?" the minister asked, not -that he
desired to know, but because the ques
tion was fitting.
"Sympathy." said the old man, "is the
vapor of love. I hope you won't ask me
to explain what I mean by this. It^is/a
commonserise conclusion. Music is a sym
pathy that one nerve has : for another,
and hence we have what Is called har
mony.'/
Old Briz scratched his head.
Old Llm continued: "Sympathy is of a
more spiritual quality than generosity.
The '-rnorant are even more generous
than the learned,
but they ain't so
sympathetic, for sym
pathy draws upon knowl
edge; we â¢ must understand "'\u25a0\u25a0-.
conditions In order tosympathize. ,V>
Now Briz, when you meet a man .' \u25a0\u25a0" \
that wants a chaw of tobacco, you
know exactly how he feels. But do you',
Brother?"' he inquired of the preacher;
"I, of course, could notâ l might say, â¢
explore the demands of his' pernicious .
habit." the minister replied, "but I. should
know how to reason with him toward- the
end that he ought not to have the.to
bacco." â¢'
"No doubt of that." old Lim agreed/v,
"But right at that place true sympathy.;
would not halt to reason. It is not reason,'/;
that the man wants. Sympathy demands
knowledge but not reason". Reason. wants
to argue and without his tobacco: as man
that's in the habit of usin' it hasn't : got '
command of his faculties. T- So, : sympathy^
would give him a chaw of .tobacco) and v
then reason with himâ wouldn't desire to
take advantage of him, you know."
- "I don't think '-your argument : is good^
for the young people," said the minister.;
- "Well, = Idon't know that the best argu
ments are intended for youngs people.^ If Â£
they were so intended^and if^ the young v
folks could understand them; 'they; would :
know by the plight of the man that 'had .

getting back -closer to^sympathy; remlndf'

â¢-â¢ t'DGE PAULS went down the office
\ steps briskly, his face, which a few
t \ moments before had been creased
(^J Into a frown, now beaming with the
satisfaction of duty well done. He
had forbidden the new doctor, who had
no prospects and no faculty for money
making, to visit his house any more.
From what he knew of Kdith. and what
he had ficen in the young doctor's eyes,
he felt that he need, apprehend no fur
ther trouble, and the affair had not gone
iar enough for cither or the young people
to puffer any heartache.
Dr. Phil was. standing in frontrof an
open window, in, his office, his hands
thrust deep into his pockets, gazing out
at the Judge as he crossed/ the .street
and passed on through the Held opposite
toward the river, probably to; see 1 if the
swollen torrent was doing any damage to
his lands. Then, with. the. same: strong,
self-contained 16ok which the Judge had
seen and, against his will,; admired the
youns: doctor turned back into his office.
There was no despondency in his. clear,
pray eyes, no weakening of his ; square
chin. He had fought, his way from al
most absolute ignorance at 12,': in : ; the
depths of a ccal mine,' through' various
situation?, to' one school . after another,
through college and- medical school and
hospital practice, until now he' was here
in tin- office of his. own, waiting: for the

Of. the total enlisted force of 29,321
men, 80 per cent are native born. Only
six years ago the Secretary of the Navy
had been forced to report that the crews
of American warships were "composed
largely of foreigners."
What kind of' Americans are these
sailors of 1905?
Here is nn answer in financial terms
that any one can understand:
Some time asro Congress authorized
and West Virginia nrc their names.
The armored cruisers, like the battle
ships of the United States, are named
after tho States, while tho protected
cruisers and gunboats are named for
American cities.
: Armored Ship for Enrh Stale.
The exceptions to this rule of nomen
clature are the battleship! Kearsarge,
the armored cruisers Brooklyn and New
York, < % ach named after the cities of
those names, and the nrmored monitors
Arkansas: Florida. Nevada and Wyom-
least In tonnage and their speed Is to bo
22 knots. Their waterlinc belting will
be 5 and C Inches of steel and their gun
turrets are nrmored In C and CV& Inch
plate. They arc all practically ready to
enter service. In case of need they
could be hurried into commission In a
short period.
Each of those swift ships mounts 4
ten-Inch guns and 16 six-inch guns in
the main batteries. The secondary bat
teries enrry 22 three-Inch guns, '12
three-pounders, 4 one-pounders, 2 three
inch ilclu pieces and 4 thirty-caliber
Then comes the Idaho class, of 13,000
tons, with four twelve-inch and eight
eight-Inch guns In turrets and eight sev
en-Inch guns in broadsideâ an extremely
powerful- broadside armament, Huperior
to that of most battleships in any navy.
This Is a seventeen knot typo and is rep
resented by the Idaho and the Missis
sippi. They are armored with nine Inches
at tho water line, making a complete belt
nine feet wide and covering all except
sixty feet at bow and stern, wheru the
nrmor gradually tapers off until It Is four
inches thick. .

*If swiftness of gunfire turns out to have

fifteen recorded minutes during the naval
battle of Santiago one gun on the, lowa
fired 135 aimed shots. r_ Two four-Inch guns ;
on the same ship threw 440 shells In that

most of this has come from purely Amer

prove that the American view of it is not
an exaggerated one, the writer, has ex- .

I can never forget the trip that I took
last summer in France, where. the roads
are the best in the world.- Oitr auto
mobile was a Darrach 24-horsepower
machine, and was run by a member of
our party. The run of 7<W miles! over
roads that are as fine for that whole
distance as any private or park roads
that can be" found for short distances In
this country, was made without an ac
cident" or a\ break. Starting from a
little seaside town on the coast of
Brittany named Concarneau, our desti
nation was Paris by a most interesting
though circuitous route. Although wÂ»
were well provided with dusters, veils,
hoods and glasses, we found - the roads
so smooth and so free froni^dust that
they were scarcely required. Our first
day's run was about 13(T miles, follow
ing the. sea coast and passing the fam
ous Druid stones, and we stopped that
night at Nantes. Our second day's run
was through that most Interesting
chateau country, which is famous for
ltsimposing chateaux and reaching the
valley of the Loire. One of the most
striking of these interesting castles 13
the Chateau of Angers,; l which belonged
to the Dues d'Anjon. Some account of
this. country of chateaux can be found
in a recent andTvery Interesting novel
called "The '. Lightning Conductor." Our
next place was at Lanseais.
_where ; .we- visited the Chateau
of Lanyeais. one of the most beautiful
! n J \! r . ance - It 'uas been of late years
restored on its' original design; as car
ried out early in the twelfth century, at
a cost of some $2,000,000. by it 3 present
owner.; Kollowlns the course of the
Loire we passed ' through' Tours, stop
ping to_inspcct the â¢ very beautiful
chateaux .of Amboise and Azayle
?is?Â®au-.? i 5?Â® au - . a . nd Passed the night at Blols.
one of the prettiest provincial towns of
France. Here we saw > the Chateau of
- Bl Â°! s ,Â« begun byLouis xil. the home, at
one time, of Francis I , and Anne of
Brittany, and the scene. of the murder
of the Due.de Gujse. '. From Blols we
made the run to C-ateau Vd'Un. which.
althou S n 'beautiful and interesting, is

hood, which comes to the shoulders, and
is brought round under the chin, making
a perfect protection , from thÂ© rain. It is
very soft, so that it can bÂ« folded up
small enough to be carried in the pocket
of the coat, and brought' out for use>
whenever required.
"When equipped with all these .things
there is no pleasure so great as tour
ing in a good automobile and over good
roads.
A very desirable coat for the
is one made of khaki and turned over
viith leather. The yellow tan khaki
trimmed with yellow tan leather is espe
cially attractive. The one that is shown'
in the Illustration Is novel, and at the
same time it ' Is serviceable and pretty,,
too. It is a double-breasted garment,
buttoning lightly on the inside, while the
flap is brought over and buttoned up on
the outside also, making it in this way
dust proof and very warm. In the illus
tration the coat Is buttoned over once. \u25a0
The cuffs and collar arc of heavy leath
er, and the pockets are faced .with; leath
er. There arc four pockets In the coat,
two of them being straight up and down
and the other two across. These pockets
are an immense convenience, and they
make us realize how great Is the advan
tage of men's attire in this particular re
spect. Four pockets in a woman's coat
make It seem very smart and sporty, in
deed. The cap to be worn' with this coat
Is' of light linen, and- Is very small and
meant to be - wind proof. The leather
.cuffs are most attractive. looking and are
fine .for keeping the wind and the dust
from creeping up the -sleeves. They/ can,
if so desired; be worn without gloves,, as
they are made to come over the sleeves
of the coat, and there is on the inside a
piece of soft leather made-.to fit tight at
the wrist by an clastic. '/
\u25a0 In* Paris many women- run \u25a0\u25a0 their own (
machines . ; ln the Bois de- Boulogne and.
manage them' perfectly well. Sarah" Bern-;
hardt,^ the world-famous actress,; learned
the art of running her car, and was con
sidered a skillful chauffeuse. ' She â¢ gener
ally worej a' long fur coat and one of .the
fascinating French automobile Uhats.
These hats are small, round, straw, hats,'
trimmed with ecru lace,' having, ecru .lace*
veils -attached, which -cover the entire
face ar.d " head and which can >be drawn
up by a cord that fits tightly 'at the neck.
In front of the eyes a large square â¢ of
Isinglass Is set Into the veil, "so that al
though the wearer can see everything
[ perfectly well, yet the'eyes are'quitejpro-.
tccted from wind and. dust. When > the
veil is not being'used'it can be turned up
and tucked aroiind' the 'crown' of - the' hat,
giving the effect of a "Very \u25a0 pretty.* hat.
prettily trimmed with lace/.; :
There -Is ''one style of which a, 'good
deal is used In Paris, which* has* not
yet made its appearance-hcre.'and'that
is the electric : coupe.?. These^machines
are not meant to .be , used for touring,
and they - are riot , speedy,' but they are"
noiseless and odorless, \u25a0 and they' are
used for calling or going: to afternoon
teas,': and are altogether. -very j smart?

also piped in white. The coat is : quite
loose, buttoning down the front, with
two rows of red s^tin buttons which have
rims of white bone. One of the illustra
tions shows this kind of coat, and with it
a little red or black three-cornered hut,
which should fit. well to the. head, so as
not to be blown away in the wind. The
hood, which is also worn, and made to
match the hat. is of water-proof taffeta.
It is intended to entirely cover . the hat
and the cape, and to protect the hair and
the neck from the dust, and it is tied un
der the chin by a cord running through
the hem around the neck. '\u25a0'* . - - '.O: "-'.

The automobile bass' are very conve
nient and quite pretty, and should always
be used on any trip. They are large and
square, made of waterproof: silk to. match
the coat. They draw in at the top with a
cord and are adapted for carrying all the
necessities that our sex requires.
IT IS now impossible to ignore the
automobile. It has certainly come to
stay, and it has already supplanted
our faithful and overworked friend,
â¢ the horse, in various directions. It
ip equally serviceable for pleasure or for
convenience a:id actual service. , In the
latter Â«=t-nse. wo need noi consider it in
any ttory of fashion, but when the auto
mobile is used for our . pleasure â¢ trips,
cither a short spin, or a long tour, then
we have to consider our costume quite se
riously, both in regard to the demands
of wind and weather and also of fashion
and the convert lons. Here in California
our roads are not the best, and there is
no escaping the dust and dirt, which will
fiy Into the tonneau. even though the
precaution of having a screen has been
duly taken, liven if the pace is what is
called a moderate one, the eyes must be
shielded from the wind and the dust, and
the face and liair must be protected, and
the dress must be covered. For long
tours there must also be Â«=Â«? me provision
made for rainy weather. The great con
sideration has been to provide costumes
which will effect these desirable things
and at the same time be at least partially
presentable, and several inventions of
combination coats, etc., ' have been
brought out. Actual experience is*, per
haps, the best teacher, and it Is certain
tl.al advice is to be had on these sub
jects from tourists who have tried thtdif
ferent experiments. It was only a few
months ago that a Mr. Wallace Brains
ford, a Utah millionaire, and his bride,
\u25a0who was a Miss Grace Holmes, made a
tour of this State. Their tour was, very
unfortunately, undertaken during our
xainy season, and the dust quickly turned â¢
to mud. and bridal attire was impossible.
Mrs. Brainsforu decided that the best and
most serviceable coat for this sort of a
trip wes cne rr.acle of heavy white rubber,
such as Miss Ethyl llager, who is one of
our best chauffeuses t was the first to
wear.
A great advantage of this rubb*er coat
is that after a long and dusty trip it
can be washed clean with a wet sponge
and made to look li-e new again. Besides
that, it is warm, which is a very im
portant quality, when riding in a cool
wind that soon seems to penetrate any
ordinary clothing. This coat, which is
shown In one of the illustrations, is very
long, reaching to the bottom of the skirt.
It hangs straight from the shoulders, and
the only ornamentation to relieve it is
black velvet, which shows on the turn
over collars, and on the cuffs and belt.
The belt, by the way. is made to take
off whenever,? thv coat requires to be x
washed. The lining of *nis coat is of
white linen. .It is heavy, of course, but
it is warm and rainproof, two very im
portant considerations for a garment de
signed for long tours beyonu the limits of
shelter or convenient stopping places.
To protect the face o.nd hair from the
dust there are hoods, -which answer that
purpose, but which have me disadvantage
of being very hot and close. If the hood
is cf domestic manufacture, made at
home, prpbably the best material to use Is
pongee or thin black silk, although
neither of these is of any service In case
cf rain. But' ln California no provision
need be made In summer- for - rainy
weather. r \u25a0â¢ . - â¢
* ICow that so many women and girls are
learning to run their own machines, en
tirely unaccompanied by a chauffeur, 1 is
is quite interesting to notice the ease and
skill that they display. But there Is a
vast difference between steering a per
fect-running car along a smooth roac
and knowins what to do in the case of a
breakdown or a stoppage. It !s frequent
ly like an occult disease, very difficult or
diagnosis and uncertain In its treatment.
It may involve a knowledge of mechanics
that very few of us could hope to attain
except ' by a long course of ' study and
training, and it is too likely that if an
accident should happen it would be at a
long distance from anywhere that aid
could be obtained. A punctured tire,
which Is, perhaps,, the simplest form, or
weakness that Is liable to occur, may be
mended easily enough, but it takes time,
and it is a hard and dirty job at beet and
is hard on one's clothes, which will have
to be of some material that can stand
the strain. \u25a0

The fruit trade was slow, and Breezy
\u25a0was highly impatient. The superin
tendent compelled him to stay behind
iiis counter, ami he had to gaze impa
tiently over the bustling crowd of the
fclore, which seemed to Eton at every
other counter but his. Twice, when
the superintendent was not about, he
ni&de a personal canvass among the
shoppers and secured a number "of
talcs. The third time he was discov
ered and peremptorily ordered back.
After closing time Breezy was ab
sent-minded and restless. The noise
of the overhead cash system; the aroma .
of freshly roasted coffee, of bacon and
of cheese: the dick of the weighing
scales; the rcraping of the busy scoops;
the shrill staccato of the register bells
and opening drawers; the rustle of
, the wrapping paper: the shuffle of hur
rying feet; the rumble of the drays on
: the cobbles outside; the incessant hum
of voices and the ever-changing pan
orama of shoppers â all these had be

he sighed fcr them longingly ere the
evening was over. He had a printing
press, and he set type as a means of
diversion â all matter concerned the
grocery store.
lie set up a card and embodied in it
an idea that he had conceived. He .
printed 503 of them â all^the cardboard â¢
lie had. They were invitations to the
public to havo Â«.ny and all sorts of
fruit delivered at their homes at any
lime by telephone orders. He laid one
on Mr. Leslie's desk \ the next morn
ing.
"Thompson," Breezy heard Leslie call
shortly afterward to the superintend
ent, "this is a good idea. How many
did you have printed?"
â¢ Thompson grew red. "I didn't have
any printed," he replied in surprise. .
Leslie frowned and called his partner,
â¢who also professed ignoraccc. Breesy
Y/atcheÂ«2 them from behind the regis

Â°"I printc-d them on my own press.
Here are Â©00 more."
Leslie looked again at the card, and
then raised his eyebrows at Thompson,
Mho nodded in return, seemingly sig
nifying that this was the clerk, men
tioned in some previous conversation.
"You may hand in your bill for them
to tho bookkeeper," said Leslie evenly:
"and, Thompson, you may have them
properly distributed."
He was paid for his cards ; and there
wns also an extra dollar in his weekly
I#ay envelope that Saturday. He
promptly bought the best seat in the
theater.
They found him the next week in the
telephone booth calling up successive- ,
ly from a list of over 100 residences,
"Is this Mrs. Jones?" he would Vask.
"Pardon me, Mrs. Jones; this is Les
lie's. We would like to. sell you some
groceries." And then he would enter
into a conversation for. an order. The
other people on the line were indignant,

WHEN the prosperous though
unprogressive firm of Casper
W. Leslie & Co., grocers,
hired him they thought they
hid secured aa ordinary clerk,
end gave themselves no further
concern. They already had a force of
about a dozen clerks, besides half a
dozen delivery teams. They had hired
clerks for twenty years, and it was to
them a troublesome and vtxatic/is pro
ceeding. The; p frowned at first at hi 3
Elight frame, but when he put a pros
trate susar barrel on end with easy
unconcern, all objections were imme
diately withdrawn.
His surname was the leveling one of
Smith, and his Christian nameâ highly
Christianâ Hezekiah. His mother called
him "Zolce" and his companions
"Breezy."
Breezy entered upon his work whis
tling in supreme content. He was at
the bottom of the commercial hill, and
was preparing to run up to the top.
He had no star-high ambitions to
make him forgetful, and no vices to
keep him from doing his best. There
wasn't a lazy tendon in his body. He
was not tall. If he had been he would
have' been lazy. He was short, thin,
black-eyed, nervous and muscular. Be
fore, his ponderous companions got an
idea through their heads Breezy was
half-way done with the action. A few
thought he was a genius, but they
>verc mistaken. Breezy was innocent of
the smallest spark. He just had a
heavy capital of nervous energy that
made him work while others were con
tent to lounge.
They put him behind the fruit
counter. His lirrt act was to clean it
up and "fix things" generally. "Such
a rum-tvey of doing business," he mut
tered, quite like an experienced groc*er,
scowling at ths hidden waste and slip
shod displays of his predecessor. When
he yas through with the counter there
-* f as absolutely no fault to find with
it. But he wa3 not satisfied. He went
into the cellar and started to saw and
nail some box<?s to make receptacles
tor various things back of his counter.
"What arÂ« you doing here?" said the
j-ompous tind obese superintendent,
Jirding him at work.
"Oh," said Breezy carelessly, "I'm
just getting some boyes in shape to
put dirt and tools in at my counter."
"We have got a carpenter to do
that," said the superintendent, with
displeasure. "Get up where you belong
and tend to your customers."
3re?zy went up. and finished the
boxes later, when the superintendent
*aas absent. He cleaned the fruit on
his stand four times a day. "It gets so
blamed mussed up." he said briskly to
a fello\r clerk, who looked askance at
the action.
"The other clerk didn't," replied his
companion suggestively.
"Didn't he?'" said Breezy coolly.
Of course the clerks laughed at him.

But Breezy ran to extremes, and one
day, when Leslii paused before a cheese
sign ; and ' read. "Hold your nose here.
It only takes the clerk two minutes by
the clock tc wrap up half a'pound of it
at' 3o cents,", he decided that he would
draw the limit, and he told Breezy to
take it down, which Breezy did with a
rather. crestfallen air. 1. He had been
particularly /proud of this effort, and
had stood behind his register a dozen
different times during the day to watch
customers stare and break out into
laughter. Aweek later they made him
take another one down, and Mr. Leslie
'-called him aside.;
V VDon't try to \u25a0 be so funny on your
cards,", he frowned. "You make nice
' cards when you stick to fact, but when
you get humorous you are as loud as

Breezy" grunted ungracious acquies
cence, while 'the corners of the grocer's
-mouth twitched at the recollection /; of
some of the cards. .{ But they continued

" complained to Leslie about it. and \u25a0 the
proprietor sat for a few momenta 'in
deep thought.

cordingly madei and Breezy became a
.'sort -of confidential -clerk, doins most
of "the : firm's business with the banks
; and the downtown offices. Character
" istically. he/allowed no opportunity to
;'i escape; to learn the; firm's ; manner â¢ of

. . not chary with suggestions, either. : and

and that \ it was \ therefore not , vefy f val

"Yes. sir," said Breezy. ; .V. V
For the next "six weeks the customers
at Leslie's enjoyed daily treats from
the signs. ; There; were no less than
fifty to be made on busy days. The lan
guage was -simpler.it told the truth
about the goods, Jand? if never disap
pointed,.and quite often there was a
bitof humor in it. The obese super
intendent frowned 'at Breezy 's efforts
andlooked as if he half regretted his
venture. V: ; v , . "^ " .
â¢ "The old guy," mused Breezy one
day;? as he. saw! Thompson deliberately

good as they are to-day." Promptly.
Breezy had another one up, which
read: "It'Â« throwingthese eggs at you
to sell them for 15 cents the dozen.
They're not bad. though."
Thompson stood before it for full two
minutes before he decided to let it pass,
and then walked away, murmuring
&r

a pound one of these days."
As he stood in the office of the com
pany ; he_ heard , a^man say Rorhethiug
â¢confidentially to the produce man and
/ a customer, that made him wink hard.
-It'was' that butter -would go up In a
few days. a " The customer did not seem
to take, it r very seriously, but Breezy
construed it into a "mighty tip.
"Just .what I thought,", he said to
himself.* '.That slow firm buying only
twenty tubs.'" It" occurred to him that
he might telephone to .the firm and
give them the tip: but he immediately
rejected ~the ' idea.
"They'd only laugh and tell me that I
wasn't runninfTi their business.". "
Then was born a great idea. An In
stant.ilater-he was .decided. 1 ; -.The pro
ducer whistled when Breezy handed
him an order for a hundred tubs.
V "It'll take. all wehave." he said.
Breezy sat down at a desk and wrote
something rapidly. The foreman at the
newspaper/ composing â¢ room looked at
I him in surprise as he* gave directions
about border and ;type. . technicalities
which he had learned as editor of the
i school paper.
The tubs -were alf; delivered in tho
afternoon. Thompson came out In tho
wareroom and looked at the first batch
* of " twenty." "I * wouldn't have ordered
! twenty!" he saM, shaking his head. "I
I told Jim they wouldn't go." .He wasn't
in when the. rest. came. "Are they turn
1 ing the store into., a. butter house?" said
the shipping cterk. , grumbling, ,. as ha
; helped the men", bring/them in. .
:~: ~ "Great heavens! ".ejaculated Thomp
son the next morning,' when he caiac
â¢ into the wareroom.' "Where does all
this butter: come from?"
The shipping clerk looked unintelll
[ gent, and made'no acswer.' Thompson
] brought in \u25a0 the head of the firm, Mr.
Leslie. He, in turn, stared durably.
at the tiers of tubs. , '- .'\u25a0.:
"What the !" hÂ« began excitedly.
"I told you to order twenty, didn't IT*
"You advised me not to buy more,"
; said Thompson stiffly, "and I didn't."
"Can't you ccmnt?" exclaimed . Leslie
wrathfuliy, pointing to \u25a0 the 'â¢; tubs.
"There's a hundred there, if there's
one"'
When Breezy was finally called to he
faced both men easily.
"How many tubs of butter did you
order?" asked Leslie.
"One hundred."
"I told you twenty I" roared Thomp-
Leslie did not answer. .but made for
the telephone. The -produce people
firmly refused to take back the tubs.
"We've just refilled our refrigerators
and can't accommodate any more,"
they said. But the/ added . something
more in a (telephone whisper.
"Mr. Leslie." said Breezy, when ttia
proprietor rang off, without any Visi
ble allayment of his wrath. "I was
ordered to get only twenty, but I made
it a hundred, andâ : â "
"You didj did you?" burst out lies
lie, glaring at Breezy with unutterable
derision. "You'll be advertising your
- self as proprietor of this store shortly,
won't you?"
"But, Mr. Leslie," protested Breesy,
"butter's going up in a few days!"
"Great guns!" roared Leslie, "are^â
are. you. running this firm, you impu
dent young fco!? You young barrel vf
gall! I've a notion ti> break your
head!"
Breezy Hushed angrily.
"Go out and draw your salary, and
never set foot here again!"
.Breezy turned on htÂ» heel and walked
out. without looking ut the clerks whu
had assembled at thÂ»; wareroom door,
attracted by the loud voices.
"Fools! fools!" he muttered between^
his. teeth, as he drove his bicycle along
the street.
When he looked at copies of all thÂ«t
morning papers, in which appeared the
advertisements he had prepared the
day before in lieu of the originals, he
smiled in genuine artistic gratification.
"If -that don't sell butter," he
chuckled, "nothing ever will." The ad
vertisement predicted that butter would
go up very soon, and that Leslie & Co.
had bought, in anticipation of this, 100
tubs, v.hich they would sell at one cent
belov.- the market price.
"There will be a still awfuller row la
that shanty, when they see these. They
might arrest me." But the spirit of
Breezy rose hopefully to the possibility,

He learned afterward that the stora
was crowded with butter buyers f rom
early morning until late in the after
noon, and that' his advertisements had
precipitated the coming rise in price,
and an advance of "one cent was al
ready asked that same day. '
It was during the afternoon of tho
next day that Breezy received a note
asking him to call at the office of tho
grocery firm of Leslie & Co. >.\
"See here, young man," said Leslie to
him in his private office, "what you did
on was a thing that could
have*put you behind prison bars. Do
you/understand?"
A*s Breezy still-held his peace, Les
lie resumed: "As a result we areâ er
â have cleared, well, some hundred
dollars."
Breezy still remained silent and
Leslie "put ori a pompous frown.
"Understand, young man." he de
claimed, "in giving you the position
of superintendent and advertising
manager, of this, store we most cer
tainly, wish to express our vehement
displeasure of your "act .of Tuesday,
lucky as it happened to turn out, and
solemnly warn you ', that a.:, repetition
of such a monstrous offense will mean
instant discharge. To hold this po
sition you will have to confine your
self to reasonable and cautious meth
ods <j* doing business. Your salary
will be three times your former one.
Get out now, and don't bother me.
but show up ready for work Monday
morning."' . * ; â¢
>The, only evidence Breezy gave of
his^ satisfaction with this interview
was, that tie rode madly lup the full
length of the steepest hill in the city

Mr. Maverick, at a time when nearly every per
son in the region about the fatal cave had been
swept away, had taken a large farm and proceeded
to cultivate the. land; but being by .profession- a
sailor he had adopted a singular but safe device to
prevent himself from being carried away into the
depths of the cave when the wind blew. This was
nothing but an anchor attached to a long rope, arid
each of his oxen* and his horses was also thus pro
vided, with the result that he farmed along for
years, although often enough both lie and his. cattle
were lifted, into the air, and had not his anchor held
firm they would have been swept away. By, and by
the wind ceased to blow, and for some years Mave-.
rick farmed in peace, untilat last he neglected, to
use bis anchors, and then one day he was caught
up along with his plow oxen and was lost forever.
Mrs. ; Maverick hastily rigged up the anchors
again and managed to save her cows and a horse,
after which she tilled a small" part of the farm" un
til Tom grew large enough to go to the city, and
then, when he had gone, she felt easier. Several
times,- <luring his short lifetime. ' the dread wind
had mafic itself 'felt and .hundreds of men, horses
and cows, as well as chickens, dogs, cats arid'the.
like, vanished instantly from their dwelling places,
sucked - into the black opening; and it was > during
such a period that Tom, after living in the city; for;
several years, suddenly appeared in a red^ automo
bile at the gate of his mother's farm. She ran out
to see what was wanted, and, lo ! there was her bovl:
;"Tve come home. at'lasC mother !" shouted Tom.'
as he sprang out.. "I'm tired of the city, aridfl'm
going to. live with you now."
'ilrs: Maverick, holding fast to the doorknob,! for,
the wind . was blowing a gale toward ; the distant ;
cave, cried: . ; \\
"Oh!I am-eoglad. But,> Tom, be; careful ;Vihe =
wind is rising! " Can't you" feel its fearful power ?"'
"Pooh ! Xo - wind on earth, can", budge a . Buug- .
starter automobile!" said-Tom... "lt's; such a T wiiidj
maker itself that I don't mind a slight bspeze" like
His mother, knowing that her son was an in
quisitive child, soon after this "sent him to a far
distant city to school, where he learned many
things; hut in spite of his mothers caution; he be-
came, ns he grew older, only the more determined
to explore the Wind Cave.^ His uncle Elmer,"; per
haps, vras the cause of this determination,* for he
told Tom .sail about^ his lost father^ Tonys mother,
rarely referred to "his loss, but Uncle Elmer was
full of it. '
."Keep away from it! It is a fatal spot!"
"But the wind doesn't blow into it always, -they
tell m<?," paid Tom after a pause.' "It caivt always
be so perilous.*'
"All! That's the worst of it! For long periods
all' is quiet and apparently safe." said his mother,
"but when people have almost forgotten' all, about
â¢;the dreadful spot, and Kieh' come to dwell near it
and. lay out farms, raibe. cattle, send children, to
school and think nil is secure, suddenly the awful
wiad s tart.s i:p atod sweeps everything â men, cattle,
all â into the cave's black mouth, never to be seen
again!"'
"It's very curious!" asserted the boy. "I'd like to
know the cause of it all."
FOR a hundred miles around every man, woman
and child knew about the dreaded Wind
Cave of Doomed Valley. Its name was whis
pered to children as soon as they could underst'Ajd,
and they were , taught to always keep far from its
black, forbidding entrance. When Tom Maverick
was a e-mail boy he asked his mother why. all men
feared this cave. - .
"It's a dreadful place ! Whoever approaches It is
rackfd into its o.epths by a Etrongwind that no man
can resist. Even horses and cattle are drawn down
-into -it!-' replied his mother.
''But has nobody ever tried to find "out what does
it?"' demanded the boy. . \
1 "Ccrl?iiily not! Who would be fool .enough; to
want to venture into such a place?" said Mrs. Mave
rick. "Too many have perished there already. Your
poor father, only a year after you. were, born, was
lost thus, I Â«lo believe. He vanished suddenly. .and
completely, and from that day to this has never
been heard from. :J
"Some day I must sec this cave," declared Tom.
His mother shuddered.

sing. Wagnenan, roles, some time; in f the
Hamburg Opera-house, singing in forty
operas all told, Is the way Mr. Berthald
has put In his time since j he . was here
eleven months ago. How well -he - sings
can.be :judged 4 f rom the fine freshness of
the voice after this long and strenuous
experience. It is as fresh as if*he"had
Just r, begun to sing. Tristan, too, Loge
and Siegfried were among; the .tenorjs
chief successes, and he was chiefly occu-;
pied with the -Wagnerian j repertoire.' tiAn
unmeasured commendation seems to J have

efforts this last year, and one Is at no

a distinct triumph for, the .Tivoli. For'us
it means 'also the. production of comic

jects of the kind, , and modestly the
young man hopes to tackle some of
them some day. . ;
on the "seamy, 6lde of the . curtain."
He happened to take part there in the
750 th performance of "Cyrano de Ber
gerac" Even for this performance the
play was carefully rehearsed. He de
scribes' the" Coquelin rehearsals, the
great man rehearsing all night, every
gesture, every phrase, every position,
every expression being determined by
him. He describes him dropping over
a chair back and falling asleep with
fatigue. Even here, though here he
professes profound admiration, the
young iconoclast is not satisfied.
"All little .Coquellns are the Coque
lin Company," he says, the great man
allowing absolutely no scope for
originality.
With Rene Dumic, the brilliant satir
ist of Les Debats, \u25a0 Mr. Harris spent
many fascinating hours. Buisson~of
Les Temps also helped % to form- the
young person's taste, and Emll-Faguet,
the well known r authority, on .dra
matrc* ~* arUT'wTio *;'. Is*^"alT^ tKe^Sofr
bonne, further contributed. It is to
Mr. Dumic that: Mr. Harris acknowl
edges his deepest debt.' It ' was with
him that the. Californian studied , the
development of "French _ comedy. '" Ani
toin'e's and Le Grand Guignol, with its
curious,, unresolved, unfinished drama,
a slice of life merely, and of the Police
Gazette order usually, the young man
then absorbed.
In Paris "The Crucifixion" was writ
ten. The playwright was at this . time
with Coquelin at the Porte St. Martin,
The playwright describes the play as
the Oswald side of the "Ghosts" story.
It Is the exposition of the struggles of
the man born without will, without
health, without strength, against the
adverse circumstance. It Is "The Cruci
fixion" that was accepted by the Eliza
bethan Stage Society, then refused
production on account of Its horror.
Anyway, after Stratford-on-Avon, our
passionate pilgrim \u25a0went to London. It
was to William Archer that he went,
"as to the Oracle of the ReaL"-, \u25a0 ;.?
"What have you done?" asked Archer.
"Nothing." said the Californian.
"It takes the English playwright a
(rood many years to learn that," said
Archer. "There's Ink." he said then,
"there's a pen." Then he took him to
the window and showed him the stream
of London story flowing before: "And
there's life. Now. go write."
For Archer, and with the leaning
toward the horrible that most of us be
#in with, Mr. Harris wrote the play he
calls "The Crucifixion.*' It Is to this play
that Archer gave much praise, and
prophesied handsomely for its maker
therefrom.
Mr. Harris' English experience included
a delightful three weeks In the company
* of Miss Terry and Shakespeare at Strat
ford-on-Avon. But the Californian did
rot find in Shakespeare the inspiration
that he was seeking. He confirms Mr.
Shaw shockingly as to the, artificiality of
\u0084 Shakespearean comedy, excusing Shakes
peare with Shawjsh audacity on the p3ea
<->f his having to please tne groundling.
The extravagance of jealousy like Othel-
Ins. revenue like HajfllÂ£Â£Â£^j^Mlipjv,Uk f e.
\u0084MacJ>etS>. fie "points ,to as vitally â¢ op
pofed to the latterday habit of expres
sion.' The Intervention of fate, that
figures so largely In the Shakespearean
crama, he instances as anotner phase of
It essentially at outs with the spirit of
thÂ«> modern drama.
That was Mr. Harris* last undertaking
here. After it. four years ago now, he
â¢went to New York. He obtained an Im
portant role as one of six supers who
appeared with Robert Edeson at Wal
lack's Theater. Curiously, the young
man did not find this inspiring. With
almost the impertinence of G. B. Shaw
be decided from that experience and
ethers that the "American stage was not
a finishing school for anything but farce
comedy." He talked it over with Ellen
Terry, then acting with Benson iin
Shakespeare. Ellen Terry invited the
young person to England to talk It over
again. V ,H' =
It Is my prophetic soul's busy week.
I have on my conscience not only the
prophecy cf a coming Pattl, but of a
coming California playwright. But it is
much better fun prophesying when some
one else has prophesied . before you.
William Archer has said charming things
of Elmer Harris, the C. C. P.. in ques
tion; the Elizabethan Stage Society of
London accepted one of his plays for
production and in Hamburg at the Stadt
Theater Mr. Harris had a play accepted,
one out of 12J0, to be produced this sea
son. Anotherâ written under a wager
that no American play could be produced
in' a German theater, was produced at
the same theater last year, running at
intervals during the entire season.
Students of the University of Cali
fornia will remember Mr. Harris. They
will remember that wherever the foot
lights lifted in the university life there
\u25a0V.SLS Elmer Harris. They may remem
berâthough Mr. Harris hopes they won't
âa "very bad" play of his produced by
the Skull and Keys. They will remember,
as I do, Mr. Harris' quite successful ap
pearance on the seamy eide of the cur
tain in the "Fantasticks," the Rostand
comedy that "was done so well under
Professor Louis* dv Pont Syle's direc
tion.

The editor of the ; Pilgrim Magazine,

book called "The Girl, and the Deal,"
which describes a novel wooing, done, on
the fly, as it were, of a transcontinental
trip from Boston , to San Francisco. He
was 1 a Harvard - graduate, son ; of a
wealthy business v man, who was trying
to make his son: pull. his mind away from
the fair sex Just enough to first make a
business success of himself ;. she was a
girl who claimed both New, York and San
Francico jas her home /cities, but her
heart j was evidently In the West, and to
the appreciation of? the greatness of the
West she educated the Boston . man , all
the way as they sped : swiftly across 5 the
3000 miles to the journey's end and the
wooing"s | consummation. '/ As for the
"Deal," that was a difficult financial feat
by which the boy I was/expected ;to win
his title. to trust In business responsibility.

agnostic could find In It a lead to enno
blement; and even a Haeckel might lis
ten to the poetry of the suggestion that
for aught we know spirit may be petri
fied in the crystal, sleeping in the flower,
awakening in the animal and in the man,
so nearly alive that in himself he finds
the evidence that God Is. In the pleasure
it will give to all Christian readers there
will no doubt be mingled the belief that
all the best beauty of It is an unconscious
graft on the true vine, and that Felix
could not so happily have been delivered
of its truth If the Light of the World had
not lent him aid in bringing it to fruition.
Grafted or not, as you like it, there is
so much fine fruit on this ethical vine of
Adler's it is hard to select just what to
give you for a sample. A wide appeal
may be got by the election of just these
two things to tell: one of his elucidation
of a .way to love your enemies; another
of a most artistic way to love your
friendsâ an art by which in striving to
grow yourself to something greater you
become, in a sense, creator In your friend
of the ideal you would were there. It Is
a presumption, but such a pretty one
that we might pardon it in our friend
even If we caught him in the very act
of it:
"Understanding is the prerequisite of
influence. Character study exalted to the
rank of duty is one of the corollaries of
the point of view I am trying to present.
Not every one is rich enough to have a
picture gallery in his house, with por
traits in it by the old masters, or by the
new. But every one should have In his
heart a picture gallery In which are hung
the portraits of his friends. He should
be constantly busy retouching these por
traits, adding a shade here and light
there as experience teaches. He should
paint them lovingly, not uncharitably,
grieving over every blemish, pondering
earnestly whether by some art he may
not succeed in obliterating it. He should
visit this gallery often to contemplate
the portraits that are hung there^ The
gallery Is not a mere gallery, but a stu
dio. The owner Is not a mere owner, but
also a painter; and, better than any
painter, he has, to some extent, the
power, by falthfnlly. studying the Image,
to change the original." ."/:.\u25a0' \u25a0
"And again the painful love which we
bear â¢ toward enemies. . . . Simply
on the ground ;,_ that., they : are
fellow-beings, we recognize that they- are
other, selves: that the degradation of-hu
manity In them, of- whlcn, their wrong
doing Is evidence,'/ concerns usâ not as

far as we, knowlng~better than/others
the evils of their ' state, are â especially
called upon to'redeemthem,- to call, into
activity their latent spiritual life, which
is the same spiritual life, that' is # in us.

called the. forgiveness of enemies, or bet

ORPHAN GIRL WITH
SEVERAL SUITORS
If we were some personally uncon
cerned Intelligence to whom religion
coula hold out neither hope nor terror
what a curiously, amusing study human
ity's varied beliefs would be. Hear Ad
ler speak of those who are some steps
below him on the stairs: "The material
istic hypothesis of the universe lingers
only amonz the semi-educated." Quote
that to the great biologist. Ernest Haeck
el, and hear him guffaw! Now we know
that Haeckel and scientists of his ilk
would dismiss as untenable the certitude
to which Adler thinks he has attained as
readily as would Adler dismiss as unten
able the certitude of those men of the
Christian church who believe, that there
Is no need of working up a substitute for
the religion which has a revelation con
served by a living church, against which
the gates of hell -shall not prevail; and
that on that true vine, ethics, flourishing
but as a single and a minor branch, is
mightier than any whole tree of a rellg
lon of duty standing by itself alone.
The exceeding beauty with which this re
llSion of ethics Is worked out Is so praise
worthyT^so well trorth while, tlie
writing and the reading; it should
be enthusiastically commended. .In
the present ' stage _ of -the world's belief s
Its appeal Is wider than that of any re
ligious sect, for ethics Js ap art of all "re
ligions, and of all true life that strives
to live true -without religious aid.'-:
Adler I? a good writer and : his 'work
gives literary as well as ethical delight.
The Jew could enjoy it; the. Catholic for
this might almost pardon its heresy: the
If we cannot co the happy steps be
yond Felix Adler's belief. It is -certainly
good for us to go with him In his step
beyond agnosticism. That Is, provided al
ways we can believe that as we follow
him we get closer to the truth, for the
modern doctrine of the obligation of in
tellectual honesty If consistently extend
ed would teach that if truth led to the
deepest hell of unhappiness we should
follow It to that place. Cutting out re
ligious conviction and discussion,, and
speaking solely as a lover of humanity
ft Is surely well to go with Adler to that
f ort of half-way place up the stairs where
he stands now, and then to wish that we
and all others could go higher and find
truth still giving us a lead.
He affirms that there is an ultimate
higher power, though he professes to
know as little as the agnostic what the
nature of that power may be. His
profession of limited knowledge about
this higher power extends to doubt and
denial of the things which Christ said
about himself and the Supreme Being.
The book is beautiful, reverent in a.
way. Intellectual, and If the world were
really drifting away from religion its
teaching- would probably be as good a
eubstltute for the firmer, more posi
tive and consoling faiths as a serious
minded man could write.
"While considering this collection -of
essays, it may be interesting to recall
some items about this Ethical Society
movement. At its recent tenth conven
tion the Philadelphia Society was host
ess and at the same time celebrated its
twentieth birthday. In all those years
It has enrolled a membership of 600. of
which 175 are active members. The
movement was started in 1873 by Dr.
Adler. and there were but three so
cieties at the end of the first decade.
The Philadelphia society Is the largest
outside of New York. The purpose of
the movement Is a noble one, but the
growth of it In Its thirty years of life
does not promise that its method is to
be very effective. Its design Is that
character building: that will develop
fine standards of social obligation. It
Is plain that If the world Is drifting
away from the established religions
which Impel to these things, those
drifting masses may have high ethical
ldeala. but they are not going to or
ganize and unify them by uniting In
ethical societies. . v. Â».
EELIX ADLER, the leader of the
Society of Ethical Culture in
New York City, has put forth a
new book, called "The Religion
of Duty," in which he ex
presses more definitely than has
been published before his belief about
the most solemn concerns of human
life. There seems to be no name by
which to define the type of belief of
this expounder of the religion of duty.
He has probably been very generally
considered an agnostic, but his progress
toward certitude is plainly a 6tep be
yond that. He defines agnosticism by
saying: that it contends that the only
certainty is scientific certainty, based
on truth verifiable in experience. Then j
he states: "My contention is that there
Is another kind of certainty, namely
moral certainty, based not on truth
verifiable in experience, but necessarily
Inferred from moral experience."

Artificiality in society Is a doomed
thing!
And its fate has been sealed by a
growing acquaintance w.~j nature, whose
rebuke to sham and artificiality lies in
every tree, every running creek and
every mountain that lifts its head to the
skies.
As never before are the maids of polite
societyâ and 1 speak of the maids because
in America it is they who snape social
customsâ getting on good terms with na
ture. Tlity swim more, walk more, tramp
more, ride more, golf more and "rougn
it*' more than the girls of any other
period of American historyâ saving, of
course, the pioneering days, when
"Toughing .v ' and living near to nature
was a necessity instead of a cult.
The automobile is a strong factor in
the great awakening, carrying folk fat
afield who in the old days followed the
beaten- paths grown dull from familiar
ity.
; The golf oraze, too. has had its ef
fect upon the crtiliciality of society, as
has rowing, mountain-climbing, tramp
ing and other out-of-doors activities.
These conditions demand a type of cloth
ing at ence plain, utilitarian and "real"
âwithout the latter quality it won't hold
out. And clothes, be it known, have a
marked effect upon the mind and its
workings, Qften changing the personality.
Then the close contact of man to man
and maid to maid during long periods
of endurance makes "posing," or as
suming that which one is not, a difficult
thing, and i*ie pose soon wears out.
â¢ And now it has come to be passe.
In the fashionable schools and colleges
young women are no longer taught "man
ners"âthat flimsy eham taat could beâ
and wasâ put en and off at will; but they
are instructed in the basis of good man
ntrp, a trained head and heart. The
"manners" in that case take care of
themselves and thus it is mat artincial
-ity is no longer good form, a healthy,
wholesome naturalness taking its place.
In the drawing rooms and ball rooms
of America the passing of the old arti
liciality has been noted for some time,
and be it said, with no loes of grace or
eimpie elegance. But the summer sees
It growing grotesque, even as are the
manners and customs of European courts
to such as are permitted a hand-to-hand
encounter with them.
They don't "ring true." And to the
best society to-day that which doesn't
ring true is not good form.
To be sure, there are those whose In
terior, organism doesn't ring true, and, of
t course, their conduct cannot. These are
'the 6nobsâ and one need not go far afield
to find them. But that's the way they
were fashioned, and they haven't read
the eignposts on the wayâ "artificiality is
pas6e!"
Perhaps when they get closer to nature
and learn how little use she has for sham
they may reform. Who knows?

Ernest Bueren, 336 West Mission

to Policeman Frank de Grancourt early
yesterday morning that they had been
held up by two unknown men near Sut
ter and Market streets between 10 and
11 o'clock on Friday night. Both had
been drinking in a saloon nearby and
Bueren was considerably under the in
fluence of liquor.
The policeman made inquiry and
learned that Fernald was trying to put
Bueren on a .Valencia-street car to send
him home, when two young men ap
proached. Without eaying a word, one
of them struck Fernald a blow- on. the
face, knocking him down, while the
other snatched Bueren's watch out of
his pocket. They both ran along San-
Borne street and made their escape.
As Bueren was unable to take care
of himself the policeman decided to
lock him up in the City Prison till he
got sober.

IX THE BUSINESS DISTRICT
Much commotion was caused In the
San Francisco postofflce yesterday on
receipt of the Information that the
agreement heretofore madÂ«i between
the National Surety Company of New
York and the National Association of
Postoffice Clerks had been violated and
that after July 1 of this year the rate
to be charged upon their surety bonds
would be $2 or $2 50 per $1000 per an
num. Instead of the stipulated 50 cent 3
per 11000.
On March 16 of this year the an
nouncement was made that a contract
had been entered Jnto between .Arthur
Donohue, president of the clerk's as
sociation, and the surety company "for
the bonding: of all the members of the
association at the rate of 50 cents per
annum per thousand."
Frank I* Gilbert of Gilbert & Max
well, Pacific Coast managers for the
surety company, said yesterday that
the contract had been broken by the
clerks themselves, many of whom had
taken new bonds with other companies
tor 50 cents, $1 and $2 per thousand.
He said further that after July 1 the
contract would be disregarded for that
reason and higher prices asked.

IT is said that the contract is let to tunnel the Summit in order to
lower the grade of the Central Pacific Railway. This has been
made necessary by the. appearance, of the Western Pacific as a
competitor. It will cross the range by the Beckwith Pass at an
altitude nearly 4000 feet less than the Central Pacific. That is such
a distinct advantage to a freight road that the Central is compelled
to meet it by tunnels that will cost $25,000,000, one which will Ke
five miles long/the longest we believe yet bored in this country.
But while it will be an advantage in carrying freight, it will be
a distinct disadvantage in carrying passengers. It will shut out
much impressive mountain scenery that is now visible in spite of
the snowsheds, and timid passengers dislike such a long ride'under
ground. Nothing is said about disusing the present track. On it
are stations and there are business enterprises which have been in
duced by the transportation facilities it furnished. :*
There is also the land grant located in reference to the present
right of way. What, the legal effect of .removing, the:, track? and
changing the right of' way will be we are not prepared to say. There
will probably be. some 'litigation. to determine the right of a grant
aided road to make; such a decided changein a line that has been
running for forty years. As a general consideration any; improve

desirable and welcome. Whether there will be offsets that impair
its desirability remains to be seen. .
- These are days of, keen competition in transportation, and it
cannot be said that any mountain road, built so' long ago* and when
it had the transportation to itself, , is safe from the appearance of
competitors and conditions which make great changes and large
expenditures necessary to retain its business: TKe : people would
perhaps prefer to see a bridge built oyerl'the straits of Carquinez,
but this would- not meet the competitive challenge, made by a road
over the low Beckwith Pass. - /â¢ -
THE upheaval in Philadelphia lias jarred the indifferent into a
keen interest in the local government. The organization ticket
for the November' election is being reorganized out of existence;
and the outlook is that at last the independent "voters will have, a
chance to make themselves felt at the polls. Heretofore the trouble
has been that no matter what the votes were,. the count was always
in the hands of the machine. .
We have "liad that -system; in San' Francisco, backed up : and
strengthened by such crimes against the ballot-box": as \u25a0 those for.
which several men; have been punished. The need of a change ' is
not more acute in Philadelphia^ than it \ is in San Francisco. A regu-!
lar propaganda is at" work here^ to defeat reform. It has a literary
bureau, which' syndicates letters to : the country press. In t these
reform -is" scouted and: flouted,^public- crimes are^^justifiedand crim
inals are treated as martyrs. The men who haye led for reform
are nagged by/insinuation- and; indirection, - and ariTeffort is ; made to
create a public opiniom in favor of graft in government that will be.
reflected from the country^^ upon^ the city. All. this, while ;it isxoni-.

would disclose conditions as .bad as -"and in some respects worse*
than; those which scandalized St. Louis and Philadelphia^

ballot-box stuffing is merely a manifestation ! of r party \u25a0"spirit,/quite i
pardonable and by no means pernicious, will be content to let things
go* on as they are now, bad and * sure to be worse. But the citizens
who know, that these offenses are the symptom's of a deep-seated
disease will not be induced to relax ; their efforts by the scribblers

CHIVALRY
MEMORIES.
\u25a0 N his comprehensive study of "The
I Americans," Professor Munsterberj of
..". Harvard has devoted. a chapter to the
I social and economic position of the
American .woman, and - the effect which
her Influence Is likely to have upon tha
matrimonial and intellectual Institutions
of our country.
His observations are particularly tnrer
csttng to one who is looking upon thÂ»
United States from afar; by ihe light of
an older civilization.
.Self-assertion he finds to be .the dom
inant note of . our American femininity.
This self-assertion does not tend toward
simplicity and directness, however, as
one might "expect, observing its effect
upon masculinity, but instead toward
greater perplexity of personality, toward
contradictions in feminine character
which grow Increasingly subtla and per
plexing. .
The American girl receives an eaual
' school training with her brother. In col
lege she is taught to look forward to a
! career, or at least to an Independent and
useful existence. in which wlfehood and
motherhood may or may not play a part.
When she marries she becomes her
husband's social representative, and em
bodies before* the world his financial
standing, his social power, and tho In
tellectual status of his home.
\u25a0 Out , of this condition of feminine dom
ination there arises a ; marriage relation
which is purer than that indigenous to
European soil. -The higher education of
the American girl, and the environment
of her college life, give her a moral
seriousness, a practical ability, and a
sense of perspactlve In ice every-day af
fairs of life, which tend to exalt mar
riage by emphasizing its spiritual and
moral sides.
Even the number of divorces in ths
United States, which are so often quoted
by foreigners . as an evidence of the in
ferior quality of our domestic life, is not
an unfavorable indication, so far as na
tional purity is concerned, since in so
many cases the real motive for divorce,
however cloaked by legal technicalities.
is highly ethical, springing from an un
willingness of one or both parties to
continue In a ', relationship that is no
longer spiritually congenial.
' In yet another respect Is the American
marriage purer than the European. Pro
fessor Munsterberg declares it lacks the
commercial element. With us a man
marries a woman for human reasons and
not for the sake of her dowry or for
social advantage. This Idea, which the
whole nation shares, makes of marriage
a highly moral relationship.
Yet, granting all this to be true, says
our critic, admitting that the American
woman has contributed to the purity and
exaltation of marriage by her Intellectual
superiority and her social and economic
power, has she not at the same time
learned much which tends to disorganize
marriage, â¢ the home, the family and the
State?
Compare American life with that of
Germany, where women are gradually
being given greater oportunitples for edu
cation and economic independence, and
we "find mis difference in motives, which
furnishes a good basis for argument on
the Question: while there is a desire in
the former country to protect marriage,
it is not presupposed that woman's high
est good Ile3 in the marriage relation.
The improvement of marriage : Is under
taken . for -the betterment- of ..the .in
dividual.
In Germany, on the other hand, wom
an Is given greater ' advantages . than
she has hitherto enjoyed that she may
fulfill more competently """ her natural
destiny. The improvement of tho indi
vidual is undertaken for the betterment
of marriage.

THE history of American railroading is the story of increasing
speed on the rail. When it was discovered that a train
clings to the rails just as safely at a high speed as it does
at a low speed, the race for records began. The speed has gone
up from 54.28 miles per hour to 63.82, and finally on the Lake Shore
road the record of 70 miles an hour has been made. The time
between New York and Chicago has been reduced to 'eighteen
hours. Fifteen years ago, or more,. when the Pennsylvania reduced
it to twenty-four hours, people held their breath and the news
papers had an irruption of head lines. Now a quarter of that. time
is cut 'and it is the sensation only of a day. We have now the
fastest trains over long runs in the world. It was sure to be so.
American life is rapid. Such of us as have the good, luck to
be born, in these days of race suicide, rush out of diapers into
dress suits, go through college as if thrown out of a sling, are
rich or poor at 28, bald-headed at 30, grandfathers at 40, dead at 50,
and at last compelled to. go slow by the funerai conventionalities
of society. We want everything quick. .We can't drive an auto
mobile moderately, but must rush it until all the pleasure of the
thing is lost in the terror and tension caused by speed.
Burbank has guided nature in the production of new plants,
or endowing old plants with new energies, and from his wizard
hand have come innumerable useful and beautiful creations. But
the widest attention has been given to the statement that he
has produced a sort of Jonah's gourd walnut tree that / can be
seen to grow and is bearing nuts before the shell from which it
sprouted has decayed. This was something fast and suited to the
spirit of the time. The remotest country paper has mentioned it
and speculated about it. Nearly all have omitted to discuss the
economic value of such a tree, but all have been charmed by the
element of speed "in its growth. (
These are Jack-and-the-beanstalk days. Everything sprints.
But nature is not disturbed. Her deliberate processes move on ns
they have from the beginning, and a thousand years are as one.
But in the matter of railroading, speed is not all that has been
accomplished. In order to run fast there must be the best road
bed and track, and these are as necessary to the safety of slow
trains. In order to beat the speed record railroads have had to
pay more attention to track and bed and grade. These things are
giving an economic return.
But no matter how good the track, fast trains and slow .will
leave the rails, and that is the time that the fast train suffers most.
Still good and rapid Americans should be pleased even then, for
they are flying into the next. world by the fastest train in this,
and have something to brag about to those who crossed by the old
fern r .
This new time between Chicago and New York makes it
possible to travel from ocean to ocean in eighty-nine hours, or
three days and seventeen hours. But at the old rate of speed it
has long been possible to travel from San Francisco to New York
in four days, provided the delay in Chicago were cut out. Four
days on that run was made possible, not so much by increasing the
speed of express trains as by decreasing the number of stops. It
was the saving of time more than the making of speed that did it.
The Pacific Coast is more interested in a -through service to
the Atlantic than it is in high speed from Chicago to New York.
Time was that a break of a half-day in the journey at Chicago
was restful. But that time has gone by. The. comfort and con
venience of travel provided by the splendid equipment of our over
land roads make people tak*e a journey for the purpose of resting.
There is no longer any reason why we should be denied through
cars to New York. The change at Chicago is a nuisance, against
which it is time to protest. A through Pullman coupled on to any
of the forenoon express trains going East from Chicago would land
us in New York # in four days, without resorting to the eighteen-
The Call is no knocker, but it proposes tohammer for a through
car to New York. It would be policy for an existing road to fur
nish this facility now, and not wait until a new road compels it
by competition. It would seem to be an easy and natural thing
in railroading for our roads to be in such relations with Eastern
roads as to be able to cut out that delay in Chicago. When we
get that through car across this continent it will be in order to
celebrate, for it will be the longest route traveled by a through car
on the planet. v^

a good Italian. "Let .me alone! I will

political reasons, it is said.
The board decided to take away from
the Bureau of Engineering the prepara

the delay experienced in securing such
specifications from the bureau named.
The work will be placed in the hands ot

Mail reports from New York 6ay: "A feature
which some brokers were disposed to make
prominent was contained In the stronger tone
of advices frAa the coast In connection with
future peaches. Sellers were represented as
being less disposed to sell on the basis . cf
prices heretofore quoted, for the reason, a's
stated, that the crop is not turning out as
well as exi>ected. There was, however, no
actual advance in prices, but sellers were not
inclined to accept orders for straight cars on
the basis cf quoted prices. Buyers appear to
be skeptical regarding the possibility of a
crop shortage. For future Apricots quite a
fair business is being done, but it is almost
wholly confined to sales of single carloads for
August 6hipment en the basis of 5%c for
choice Royals in bags f. o. b. coast. Advices
received toward the end of the week indicated
increasing unwillingness on the part of Santa
Clara crowers to consider offers under a 3c
basis for their crops of Prunes. Ofteis to sell
on a 2%c t. o. b. bag basis for the four sizes
were not withdrawn by packers, but even at
this once and in the licht of the attitude of
the growers buyers here are indifferent and
reported transactions are confined to occasional
sales of carload lots. Spot stocks of California
dried fruits are l'tht. but the demand is
limited and prices are somewhat nominal."

PARIS. June 24. â M. Pingard, secre
tary of the Acadamie, is unable to per
form his duties Just now owing to ill
ness. Although regret is expressed, cer
tain of the "forty immortals" are satis
fied, as they are now able to smoke in
peace. M. Pingard is a non-smoker, but
during his absence his colleagues have
been making hay while tfie sun shines.
As a "result of this it has been found
necessary to restore the marble bust of
Merhnee. which the smoking immortals
used os an object to strike their
matches on. - -.'..,,

BRUSSELS, June 24.â The performance
of "Faust" at the Theater de la Monnaie
â¢was disturbed in a singular manner the
other night. Marguerite was ringing the
jewel bozxs when a black cat fell from
the third gallery Into the pit, alightlng
on a man's head. The cat's claws sank
Into the unfortunate auditor's cheek and
ear. wounding him rather seriously. Aft
erward the animal bounded through the
theater, seeking an exit. The ladies in
the theater became . greatly excited. A
fireman on duty In the theater had to be
called. He succeeded In capturing the
cat and so restored tranqutllty to the au
dience. ,;..
Cat DlKtnrts Timt"
This brief resume of what at first ap
peared to be a trifling incident was the
sequel in the interesting culmination of a
campaign against police corruption that
dates back to the famous mob of IS9I in
New Orleans, when eleven Italians were
shot to death in their prison cells by a
party of determined citizens. Chief of
Police Hennessey had been murdered at
the instigation of the "Black Hand"
because) cf his effort to put a stop to
crime. \u25a0 \u25a0 \u25a0
New Orleans has had to pass through
a. stage ot slow reform, such as hs<s been
Inaugurated by several cities of the East,
r.otipeably Philadelphia. To-day there is
In charge of the New Orleans department
a. man named Wbittaker, who. with the
assistance of the city officials. Is doing
much toward weeding out the objection
able members of the police force. A
complete revolution in the department is
taking place, and the New Orleans news
papers are now able to 6ay that the re
form has accomplished Its purpose.
\u25a0" Orily one stone seems to have remained
\u25a0unturned. Nothing In particular has been
tfone to turn it except by a general de
nunciation incorporated in declarations
that It' is a -stumbling block. This un
ttirned stone Is said to be D. C. O'Malley,
proprietor of a small New Orleans daily,
â¢who was the man who obtained a list of
the "secretly" selected talesmen that
\u25a0were to be questioned as to their fitness
to Berre on the jury that was to try men
\u25a0who were accused of having murdered
Chief Hennessey. Tho Grand Jury of
ISSI intimated that O'Malley was guilty
of having "fixed" several Jurymen, which
prevented the execution of legal justice.
He was at the time a private detective
In the employ of certain criminal Ital
ians and member* of the rough element
cf thÂ« city.
Now the war Is 'being carried on against
O'Mallty. He was indicted for perjury
during the Hennessey case, and since
that time Is said to havo been in league
\u25a0with thÂ© very men who caused the
trouble which startled the world with
New Orleans' swift and decisive exhibi
tion of the fact that there Is a Emit to
human endurance.
The undoing of O'Malley is said to
about be accomplished, and with the re
moval of Jouroee and the summary pun
ishment now being meted out to the of
ficers and men of the New Orleans Police
Department, who have been proven to be
friends of the crooks, the Incident of the
mob of IS9I will booh be forgotten, and \
the murder of "Dave" Hennessey will be
avenged, -.0*

As the municipal budget has, been
based on a total assessed valuation' of
$510,000,000, the estimated 110,000.000
increase will give the city an additional
revenue of $100,000 under the proposed
city tax rate of $1,164, of which $1 is
for the running expenses of : the 'City,
including permanent improvements, ag
gregating nearly. $1,000,000. 'If :y: y the
exact amount of the assessment j roll
were known by next Monday, when the
charter requires the tax rate to] be
adopted, it would be possible to reduce
the tax rate by nearly two cents, pre
suming that the roll will figure; $10,
000,000 more than what the Supervisors
estimated municipal expenditures upon.
The tax rate will be adopted at to-mor
row's meeting of the Board of Super
visors after Dodge has given an esti
mate of what the total roll will be.
REVENUE IS LARGER.
Last year showed an increase of, a
little more than $75,000,000 on the as
sessment of 1903. Dodge, on July-l.
1904, returned an assessment roll of
$511,000,414, but after the Board of
Equalization revised the roll and some
$6,000,000 was deducted, owing to cleri
cal errors, the exact assessment was
placed at $502,892,459. Deducting ; $5,
000,000 for small holdings and national
bank stocks, it is estimated that $20,
000.000 will be added to the roll of 1905.
including $10,000,000 on new improve
ments and about $10,000.00 on .newly
discovered property "and real estatein
creases. It is the opinion that after t
the roll is revised by the Board of
Equalization, which has the power: to
cancel or reduce assessments, it will
figure approximately $520,000,000, and
may fall slightly below that. amount,
taking the prospective delinquency into
consideration. ,
In compiling the assessment toll this
year Dodge was confronted with, a loss
of nearly $5,000,000 to begin with. ;Of
this amount $4,000,000 represents the
assessment on personal property-hold
ings of $100 or less, which are exempt
ed, under a new law, from taxation;
The sum of approximately $700,000 was
also lost in last year's assessment -on
national bank stock, which a decision
of the Supreme Court exempts from
taxation. This of itself reduces last
year's figures to some $495,000,000. _
IMPROVEMENTS INCREASE ROLL.
The loss on small holdings will be
more than offset by new improvements,
the sum of nearly $20,000,000 having
been expended for new building opera
tions during 1904. Assessing these im
provements at 50 per cent of their
value would add $10,000,000 to the roll
on that item alone.
Assessor Dodge will turn over, the
assessment roll for 1905 to- the Board
of Supervisors on Monday. July 3, and
expects to return an increased valua
tion of nearly $20,000,000 above the as
sessment roll of last year.. which to
taled the sum of $502,592,459.; The ex
act amount of the assessed valuation
will not be known definitely until the
date named. Dodge will put . his ex
perts to work all day on the Sunday
preceding . the first Monday ."-. in July,
when lie is required by law to submit
the roll to the Board of Supervisors,
which will then sit as a Board of
Equalization until the third Monday in
July, when the roll will be approved,
after revision. ;,/:-; '

URGES ACTIOX BY PRESIDENT.
, rfentos, whicli-'when theyclosed to-night,
.* tliov.ed a fall of one franc eight centimes
Within the week.
The official view is that the situation,
vrlj'.lc delicate, docs not' present any as
jject of danger or a crisis involving a rup
ture, of relations. This is the governments
ai view, and naturally presents the most
lavorable aspect of the controversy. How
t-vcr. the Embassadors of the leading
I>owers express impartial opinions fully
fj^tp.jnins the view of the Government.
â¢It is pointed out in diplomatic quarters
.hat the worst aspect of the Moroccan
question does not present a casus belli.
. An analysis of the controversy 6hows that
the Suitan of Morocco invited the powers
to a conference Germany urges the
powers. Including France, to accept. Pre
mier Rouvier's latest note shows the will
ingness of France to consider a confex
tnce If Germany explain her purposes;
but, even if France decline to accept, this
refusal of the invitation does not consti
tute a c&use for war. A diplomat summed
up the situation by saying that the com
plete default of the present negotiations
would not mean war, as the controversy
would proceed along new lines.
The controversy serves to call atten
tion to the complete state of leadiness of
the French military system to meet any
emergency. The present peace footing of
the army is KO/jOO men. This force is
organized on an elastic basis, whereby
ihe doubling and tripling of the strength
of each company doubles and trebles the
aggregate of the army. The ffrst and
Bspoiid. reserves are made 'up of trained
men who 'heretofore have completed the
military service, which the state requires
(OK cltiscns to complete. The 'equipment
of the reserves Is always kept in readi
ness at the barracks. Military experts
Kay that the calling of the first reserves
to the colors would probably furnish, an
immediate force approximately of a mil
lion trained men. and thereafter the sec
ond reserves and the territorial military
would permit of much further expansion.
The system of mobilization and equip
ment has undergone great improvement
as the result of lessons learned during
the last war. Annual maneuvers, which
constitute mobilization on a great scale.
are frequent, and "this mobilization in
various districts in which the full
strength cf the horses, wagons, trains
and equipments are quickly assembled. |
This military preparedness has no great
bearing on the present controversy, but
the military critics cite it as evidence
that France is not likely to again suffer
from the' confusion and deiay^ incident
to the beginning of the last war.
La Ãbfcite began the publication to
night of a scries of articles from the
frontier showing the excited state Â« of
public feeling and the activity, of the
miliiery forces which are alleged to be
constantly drilling and undergoing in
spection. The tenor of the articles is
similar to those that have appeared here
tofore, Tvnich showed the high military
spirit along the border and the precau
tionary measures adopted on both sides
to keep the forces in a state of prepared
ness. .
CALL BUREAU, POST BUILDING,
WASHINGTON, June 24.â The President
will on Monday issue a statement con
cerning the modifying of the Chinese ex
clusion act. The statement will explain
the position of the United States and
show that it is not the desire of the
people. here to do injustice to" the Chi
utse. The truth of the matter, is that
the complaint of the Chinese' la a good
deal of a "false alarm." '.America 'could
do far greater injury to trie Chinese by
prote.sting their goods j than China could
by boycotting United States manufact
-u#es. The principal shipments ""to' TjBTKa"
trom this country are mineral oil and
cotton and both are- absolutely necessary
to the Chinese dealera.and manufacturers.
One of the students of foreign, trade;
who te co'risidered by ' the" Goverhment as
one -of the best posted men'^on" that "sub
ject in ; the couiitry, is Harold :Bolce,
librarian, of the Treasury Department.
Bolce says: \u25a0 \u25a0 . r \u25a0 \u25a0 , '\u25a0 â¢\u25a0'> .;
"We have some ; trade with .the. Orient,
but it" Is ridiculously small. Thirty-eigrht
per cent of this trade consists of mineral
oil. Oi:r sales of manufactures is so small
that it is not worth while talking about
tnem. The. figures as given in consular
reports are probably correct, but mis
leadinc.
"Our trade with China has been greatly
exaggerated. China buys great cargoes
from other countries and the total trade
with China nets the American per capita
only 2 cents- per year revenue." .â¢ E
The record here shows that nearly all
ot the business of the Pacific Coast with
the Orient is transshipped. There is some
Pour- and canned goods * business, but
most of the so-called trade is with kero
s-t ne ships from Xew York.
The war between Japan and .Russia is
accountable for the increase of shipments
to Lhe,t>rient from the Un::ed States and
this . Increase jls not, as generally 'sup
posed, the:result of a national demand.
fpedal Dispatch to ThÂ» CalL
PARIS. June L'4â For the ttrst time since
the Fashoda incident the French public Is
in the throes of the war fever. Whether
it v.iH result in anything serious depends
on i^fertnany's response to the French note
on Morocco; but, without considering ihe
exact status of the diplomatic negotia
tions, a cor.olderable element of the pub
lic ana press seriously discuss the possl
l.'ilitiee t.t a resort to arms. Army circles
n.ro particularly active and at the mili
tary clubs the officers are mainly engaged
In makljis comparisons of the forces of
I'rsiiic-* and Germany. While the finan
cial leaders scout the idea of war, yet
me speculative clement has been quick
to seize the opportunity. to urafd French.
I.ODZ. Jnne 2*.â Altogether ten regi
ment* ore eucnmped In Lodz. The fljtht
ing Mplrlt of the' people is fully aroused.
They have tnsted blood and want more.
Certainly the v - revolutionary - fever is
abroad, and it remains to be seen
whether military nseasures . will have
the same 'effect as previously.
To-day at Ituluty, a suburb of I.odÂ»,
A our Cossack* were killed and sixteen
others wonnded'br a" borni) which was
thrown > Into their barracks. ; , Twenty
three o? their horse* were, killed.
Occasional volleys 'are stUl.nred by
dents of the city say that they received
no orders to remain Indoors.
' The present trouble began at Lodz
last Tuesday after the funeral of the
victims of *tbe conflict between troops
and terrorists the previous Sunday. Tno
Christians were permitted to bury their
dead, but the Jews were prohibited
from doing: so, and the police secretly
interred the bodies of the Jews at
night, which excited indignation, and
terrorist riots were initiated on Thurs
; day. The most serious phase of the
| rioting: developed.. when ; the crowd ' de
liberately; pillaged llauor shops, and
numbers of persona, inflamed by drink,
led 'a mob of at least 50,000 to further
and more serious attacks. Foltc* and
military were . attacked
"appeared in - small force and many ln
dividual members were killed.
After r pillaging the. liquor stores the -
crowd 'set , fire â¢to them and / prevented
the I firemen \u25a0 extin suiahing . the blazes. .
This was . repeated deliberately ."at
many . places.
On ; Friday ' the fury of the mob found
full .vent and even children, caught by
the. contagion, were seen kissing flags
and heard swearing that . they were
ready to die for liberty.
A Jewish girl , mounted a box in the
market ;' square and . addressed an Im
mense, crowd. Suddenly the police ap
peared, fired a volley and the girl fell
dead.
Market gardeners \u25a0 coming In were
stopped and their carts used In * build
ing barricades. ..Wires were stretched
in front of these barricades and tno
cavalry was unable to charge. Mean
while the mob had secured arms and
revolvers were freely used.
" Finally- the military secured the
upper ham!, but not nlthoat eouider
able* losae* to themselves and tearful
sltiuebtrr to the rioters. The soldiers
exhibited the utmost carelessness as to
whether they killed peaceful person* or
rioters.' and as - a eonseauence . many
nomea aad children -were amons the
dead. The streets on Friday resembled
a battlefield. The houses were barri
caded with boards and mattresses and
for hours volleys and Individual shot*
were heard In every quarter of \u25a0 the
city.
Until late at night the Cossacks were
busy collecting bodies of the dead and
picking up persons seriously wounded.

-The rioters this morning attempted to
set ' fire . to 3 the -Government offices, j but
of "Red SunVJay" in St. Petersburg. While
it is not yet possible to ascertain the ex
act number of the victims, "/\u25a0' estimates
place the killed and wounded as high as
2000. The troubles here were initiated, .by
the Social Democrats and ; the Jewish
Bund, who determined to average their
comrades' killed in the rioting on Wednes
day. '^\u0084 "....Â«.:..:.. â¢..-..:.\u25a0- .-^.r--" :-.-.._
On Thursday, the feast of Corpus Chrls
tl parsed off quietly, but during the night
workmen attacked the patrols. In. this
fighting two officers and seven Cossacks
{were killed. ' One' of - the latter was shot
iby a girl of 13 ytars. â¢'
At dawn of Friday commenced a day of
terror. The.cfty was given up to blood
shed. Anarchy and fierce, street fighting
prevailed all day!. "Barricades were hur
riedly constructed in the Jewish quarter
at dawn. Men climbed to the roofs of
houses, cutting" telephone and telegraph
wires to use: for 'entanglements in the
streets, while others cut down telegraph
poles and usedthem in ( strengthening, the
barricades which already had been con
structed and in building others. .., '
Early in, the day,; two bombs -were
thrown from the crowd into the barracks,
killing or wounding twenty soldiers. This
started the shedding of -blood, which con
tinued until after nightfall. \
â¢ At 11 o'clock 'all the factory hands
struck and flocked into the streets. Cos
sacks, dragoons and Infantry charged the
dense, surging mobs time after, time; fir
ing volley after volley . into .'the serried
mass. The rioters later replied with -je
yolvers, while their comrades on, 'roofs
and In windows, joined in' the fusillade.; :
Some dashed vitriol from points of
vantage upon the troopers in the streets
below. The burning fluid drove its vic
tims into a frenzy and led to scenes of a
terrible character. Fighting continued
throughout the day and only diminished
\n its intensity at nightfall when the city
was plunged into utter darkness, as prac
tically all the street lamps'had been de
stroyed. Even then, occasional volleys
and isolated rifle shots wtre heard in dif
ferent quarters, the -troops having -re
ceived orders toy shoot any person ap
pearing in the streets. V;
The dead were carted off to. the ceme
teries in military, wagons, the troops act
ing as undertakers; but this, morning
many dead and wounded were still -lying;
in the streets. and court yards. Terrible,
indeed, .is the plight of the wounded, 'ior
medical aid Is unobtainable and many are
dying for the lack thereof. \u25a0 "'
'There was a renewal- of the bloodshed
this "morning-/ 'A' regiment of dragoons
atJ&T o*l^}0 * 1^} f| tnfantry -have- been ordered
here from .i Warsaw. '\u25a0'\u25a0 /;. ' ' '
. The casualties up to noon add IS killed
or ' wounded to yesterday's appalling j to
tal. So far as yet ascertained 130 persons
were killed while . fighting officers and/41
diedin.the hospitals during. the night.. Of :
the wounded, 329 sustained only. sllghttln- 1
juries, which were attended to on the spot
by the ambulance' surgeons. All the hos
pitals of the city are filled to overflowing
and owing to the insufficient number -of,
beds, msfny of the wounded are lying on
the floors. n ,; : 'v
Many.shops an^i; factories are closed and
business is at a complete deadlock. .-" .".
The party as now made up consists of
Secretary Taft, Miss Alice Roosevelt.
.Miss Mabel Boardmajj. Miss Amy McMil
lan, Miss Helen Patten, Senator and Mrs.
Dubois of Idaho, Senator and Mrs. New

A summer trip to the islands at this
season of the ytar will be n<T light un
dertaking for a man of Secretary Taft's
buiid. He would gladly forego the trip,
he tells liis friends. If he did not think
that conditions in the islands make his
vieit desirable. He has received advices
from friends in Manila which lead him
to believe that his coming with the Con
gressional party will have the effect of
easing certain points of friction between
the Americans and the natives.
Secretary Taft has heard of several
things that have induced f him to organize
the present party and make the voyage to
Manila. The radical wing of ihe Federal
party in the islands has split from the
conservative wing and adopted what It
calls a "Taft platform." Taft does not
know precisely what this platform is. He
hab always thought he was a conserva
tive of conservatives in Philippine mat
ters, and he fears that some of his pub
lic utterances have been garbled in trans
mission to the islands, or else that some
one has been romancing, for purposes of
his own, and filled the radicals with
false hopes and ideas.
Protests, come of them bitter, are com
ing from the Philippfaes against the im
position of the internal revenue tax on
liquor and tobacco which went into ef
fect, by order of the Commission Janu
ary last. The ample advance notice,
given before the tax was imposed, has not
prevented ill feeling. The new license is
not a heavy one â only about half the rate
imposed In the United Statesâ but It has
been badly received by local interests.
Another matter that will require the
Secretary's attention is the situation that
has been created following the arrest
'of several prominent land-owners in the
province of Cavite, charged with being
the accomplices of the ladrones. It ap
j>ears that the ladrones had never been
thoroughly suppressed in Cavite. and
that sporadic outbreaks have occurred
from time to time * which necessitated
the transferring there of a large fores
of constabulary. The officers soon found
evidence that some of the important men
in . the province who were large land
owners were kept in touch with the
movements of the ladrones, and aided
them to escape from the Government
forces.
CALL BUREAU. POST BUILDING,
WASHINGTON. June 24. â Secretary
Taft's Philippine party .will leave Wash
ington on June SO instead of July 15, the
date first fixed upon. This will allow a
longer time in the islands for investiga
tion and permit those who go to avail
themselves of all the entertainments the
Americans and natives have in prepara
tion.
Special Dispatch to The Cell.
It is. difficult, to fully comprehend, the
confusion which will result. Judge John
son has divorced more than 100 couples,
and some of them have remarried, but
under the decision of the Supreme Court
none of the divorces' are legal. The di
vorces belong without effect. ths subse
quent remarriages are not binding. Scores
of men and women in the eyes of the
law are bigamists, and may be brought
to an accounting at any. time.
Children have been born to some of
the couples, â¢ ,v, v
Litigation of great estates has been
heard by Judge Johnson, i administrators
liave been appointed and. large expendi
tures of trust funds have been authorized.
AH this, it would now appear, was with
out authority of law. It is possible that
an enabling act will be passed to straight
en out the tangle, but lawyers are con
fused by the decision.
Under this rule, every act of H.>V.
Johnson, who for thirteen months has
been Bitting as a judge of the County
Court, is^ invalidated by yesterdays de
cision of the Supreme Court, which held
the election at which he was elected to
be invalid.

should be concluded at allâ before - the

the two powers.
'As : : heretofore . noted, ' there â¢is serious

RENO, June 24.â Steamboat Springs,
near Carson, have been unusually active
for the last week and at an early hour
this morning several of the extinct hot
springs began to shoot hot water and
steam into the air. Just before the
eruption occurred a rumbling noise was
heard and a slight earthquake was felt.
Following this many large geysers shot
hundreds of feet into the air, covering
the surrounding hills with scalding wa
ter and mud. The outbursts have oc
curred at regular intervals since the
first eruption and people are traveling
from all parts of the valley to witness
the spectacle.
Many springs which, have, been dry
for years are again active, and the
whole district surrounding the springs
Is covered with a dense cloud, of steam.
The Steamboat district : is the site of a
large gold > and sliver mine owned by
Colonel Hopkins and the shafts are now
flooded with hot water. .

Amendments were at once proposed and
adopted in effect as stated in the opening
paragraph. Following this Secretary
Richardson moved the defeat of the ob
noxious resolution. President Moore, who
had vacated his chair pending: the trou
ble yesterday, again presided, and after
passing the usual votes of thanks the
convention adjourned Eine die.
The set programme for the morning ses
sion was followed practically as arranged,
addresses being made by President Goode
of the Lewis and Clark Exposition; Gov
ernor Pardee of California, Governor
Goodlng of lowa'~and President Jefferson
Myers of the Oregon State Commission to
the Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposi
tion.
The plan to regulate the two principals
into harmless obscurity proved distasteful
to both and it is said that it resulted in
a meeting of the leaders on both sides at
which an understanding was , reached.
Though both factions deny this, it re
mains a fact that hostilities suddenly
vanished.
The morning session, owing to the fact
that the executive committee was unable
to report before midday, was devoted to
listening to speeches. When the conven
tion resumed for the afternoon session
the committee had the new constitution
ready. Accompanying the new constitu
tion was the : resolution -â¢ shelving both
Moore and Richardson and putting Presi
dent Mann in control until, an election
should occur under the new constitution.

ganization that could do the work. He re
viewed the organization and purposes of
the Commonwealth clubs of California.
John McN'aught followed, speaking to
the' toast "The Benefits to Be Derived
From Club Discussion." He said the dis
cussion of topics of Importance by men
and women of enlightened understanding
and liberal minds was the most potent
means of promoting mental culture that
has been devised. Debate resulted in the
bringing of men to agreement upon poli
cies of public importance. So much de
pends upon sentiment in our country, he
tald. that it is in the highest degree
desirable to have a continuous school of
popular education on topics of common
interest through the medium of debate
and discussion. The people of Califor
nia, ho declared, needed education upon
a variety of matters, including forest
preservation, improvement of rivers, Ir
rigation of arid lands and State highway
construction.

HER SERVICES COME HIGH.
The sum of $100,000 has been' Quoted
as this court favorite's charge for com
plete introduction of rich newcomers
into England's higfiest circles. This, I
am informed, Includes presentation at
court, which automatically brings invi
tations to all' court affairs. Invitations
to the more private: social functions
and the attendance of at least three
members of royalty at Mrs. Money
bag's first grand effort .This fixed
price covers the period of three months
known as London's season. That is all
that is necessary and it is really about
the "simplest way for the social aspir
ant to go about it. r For, when these
three months . are successfully gone
through with, Mrs. Moneybags is
socially fixed for life. Her standing is
secure forever,, and, while more ex
pensive than, going into New York so
ciety,;lt is more economical in the long
run, as in-New York one may cease to
be a fad â¢ and , ; the second attempt to
Join the aristocracy would cost more
than the first. Entering society through
the royal gates of Buckingham Palace
practically conquers all the social mar
ketsj.of the -/woj^d^t once. + ,
SOCiAlfttÃ^CÂ»ESS^^flU<6dX^TE.'Â»,
\ That fIOO.OOQ is invariably cash down.
The. American, "lntroducer." however, is
nothing "if 'not adaptable and she . has
what; might be described,, as ( an ."a la
carto" system, too. For instance, a. court
presentation - engineered -..by "her costs
$5000. .'For obtaining, the ..attendance of
one of the reigning family and perhaps
a couple of Duchesses at Mrs. Money
bags' first big "at home," the social men
tor demands $10,000. . This latter is the
most important event of one's social ca
reers in London. Of course, being pre
sented at court counts for a lot, but the
seal of approval is set definitely only
when royalty enters one's house. After
that there is no question. '
In spite of the i Tact that her methods
are notorious, and , have been for several
years, the American "Introducer "s" envi
able social position seems to have been
impaired little, if at- all. As has been
said, royalty doesn't \u25a0 know about the
game, and society, aeems disposed to
wink at it. But one Yather wishes that
the West End florist 7 would bring his
threatened suit,* for it Is time the -whole
business had the searchlight thrown
upon it. . .;. v..
BRITISH PEEK. WHO IS NOTED
FOR HIS MANY ACTS OP KXNI>-
UNESS. - -\u25a0
LONDON, June 24.â 1f a certain Lon
don florist' should carry out his present
intention of bringing suit against a fa
mous American hostess in Mayfalr one
of the most sensational law suits of re
cent years islikely to ensue. i .';'^Â«
The inevitable result would be a com
plete exposure of the manner in which,
:for several; years, theT lady in question
has traded \u25a0"< systematically/upon the
unique social .position which she, occu
pies here. One of the few American
hostesses in London who enjoy the per
sonal jj friendship jof Queen Alexandra
and other feminine members of the
royal family, she utilizes this social ad
vantage by making a regular business
of "boosting" rich Americans, whose so
cial position fat home is uncertain, into
the charged circle of London swelldom.
Of course, : the Queen and the other
royal women 'have; no idea that their
agreeable American, acquaintance thus
makes use of their good will for the
benefit of her own - pocket. That she
does | so, | however, :is â¢ generally under
stood in societyâ so well understood, in
fact, 'that the exorbitance of this host
ess' terms for assisting American social
climbers and the really astonishing way
in which she makes every step of the
business produce a big profit are sub
jects of frequent comment. \
: It is said that her charge for com
pletely, launching a newcomer. in Lon
don society Ms $100,000. Moreover, the
lady makes it "an 'invariable condition
that her clients should patronize certain
tradesmen indicated by her, with whom,
of - course;,- she /; has arranged w for : a
"rake-off" , on ]the .profits. At, present
she : en joys a practical monopoly in her
particularline, andthus has, been in a
position to dictate terms to the various
silversmiths, '.> stationers, caterers, etc..
.whom she . recommends , her clients to
patronize. V â¢ ' . . .'"'/\u25a0\u25a0
ArFLUEXCE LEADS TO GUEED.
Heretofore the commission demanded
by her-w'as -60 per cent, of, thevjpfonts."
and if . she had . remained satisfied -with
;this uncommonly; stiff Irate all would
have been .well. \. Not long ago, however,
"The Great Introducer," as she has been
dubbed; in social; circles, served notice
on all the purveyors with whom she had
business- relations to the "effect ' that
thereafter, her, share of- the profits must
be 60 per cent. - : . \
This ultimatum 'led to the revolt of
the florist already \u2666 mentioned, who. is
one of the best known in the West End
of London. 'Hesent in a bill on the
original ; terms, which the American
court favorite has so far refused to pay
and \ declares that unless his , demands
are met the matter; will be brought
into- 'court and the \u25a0\u25a0 whole business
"aired.". Generally speaking, of course,
the bills of rich Americans who are be
ing foisted upon London society in this
way -are; sent, direct to them, 'and the
fashionable go-between's commission is
paid to her when the account; is settled.
Quite often, however," when; one of her
clients is desirious; of .. giving a big
function â¢ the ."Introducer"
to s place all the : necessary orders and
pay all- the bills, with the understand
ing, of course.that the 'actual; hostess
shall; reimburse her on 'being apprized
of the net cost. The now recalcitrant
florist was dealt with in this way/and
herein, lies the strength of his case, the
American "Introducer" 'appearing in his
books as the actual debtor and not her
guileless client. .
Probably the case will not be al
lowed to come into court-^-tho scandal
would be too great. .The florist's threat,
however, has v got noised about -in; the
inner circles of swelldom and many
who have paid their money for May
fair'favoritism are in i terror. lest they
may be obliged to. testify; to that effect
in Ithe witness box.*. .ln case the suit
should actually be brought there is

er- than' any other living member of the-
British 1 peerage.? He was born plain-
Gilberts Heathcote;,and stuck to It for;
thirty-seven years until his father died. :
That brought him ,a baronetcy and a t
barony, and, by virtue of the latter dig-;
nity he became Lord Aveland. On the.
death 'of ;.Txls mother. Baroness Wil-*
loughby de Eresby in her own right,;
that more title passed to him.
He had been -.called Lord Wllloughby;
de< Eresby only, four years, when he
was shoved up a peg higrher on his own 1
account. Queen Victoria creating hlm>
Earl of Ancaster. His ancestors were'
Dukes of Ancaster from 1713 to 1779.^

of direct male heirs, and It Is quite

another fine seat, Grimsthorpe Castle.:
and a third near Stamford. Nc-rmaton.
Park. He also has a fine town resi
dence in Belgrave Square, of which a,
well authenticated and weird story fs
told. Lady Ancaster was giving a re-,
ception there in 1893. OnÂ© of her ;
guests, a woman who had just arrived,!
said: **I have Just seen Sir George
Tryon on the * stairs. : He looked very,
strange and white and'did not speak-";
"You cannot have. seen him," said Lady
Ancaster, **he : is -with his squadron in
the Mediterranean." The next day.
brought the terrible, tidings | that -the
Victoria, had gone down after being in.
collision' with the ' Camperdown, and
that Sir George,' who waa an admiral,
and most of her, crew had. been drown--'

brother-in-law.
The records of the peerage are frank : i
to a fault. If It were not for that no'"
one would suspect Lady Ancaster of be-J 4

JURY'S VERDICT
'At -3:30 o'clock. Heney stated that he
had finished with the witnesses for the
Government, and, in view of the fact
that the Government would be able to
rest its case on Monday forenoon, he
would suggest that' the court adjourn.
The court accordingly adjourned until
Monday morning at 10 o'clock. , \u25a0
It was shown by Tanner's own evi
dence that. Mitchell had warned Tanner
not to mix him in any matters before
the departments of the Government and
not to . receive | any remuneration for
any services the Senator might perform
in \u25a0Washington. Tanner said that
there -v,os no understanding with â¢Fred
erick Kribs that the money paid by him
to Tanner was In return for: the serv
ices of Mitchell, and that the latter had
no direct knowledge, of the source; of
his monthly remittances, his share of
the earnings of the law firm of Mitchell
& Tanner, whichwere forwarded to the
Senator at "Washington.
'Tanner said under cross-examination
that never to his knowledge did
Mitchell ever see a check from Kribs
to the firm for services rendered. Tan
ner testified that at the time of the
changing of the original- contract of
1897, which occurred in 1901, Mitchell
was deeply involved" in official business,
and that he was shortly after taken
with a severe illness. Tanner said fur
ther that he knew personally of no ser
vices rendered by Mitchell before the
departments at Washington in regard
to tbe. Kribs' claims- that Mitchell had
not performed for hundreds of other
claimants without pay. So far > as he
was aware, Mitchell might, have for
warded his (Tanner's) letters in re-.
gard to land claims to the General
Land Office and returned the informa
tion in the replies to him.
Tanner testified that, with one excep
tion, Mitchell while \u25a0 away from .; Port
land never had a chance to know of the
items entering into the monthly pay
ments to him. The one exception^ wan I
when a copy of the firm's books was
sent to Mitchell at - ' r .
The method of. handling -the' bank
books was gone over, and the defense
attempted to show that the Senator had
never seen any of the Kribs checks, and
did not. therefore know fffat he was re
ceiving money for work done. for Kriba.
All of the money received, said Tanner,
had been in one account, and. he. had
drawn from this in making the ' cash
settlements at; the end of each month.;
\u25a0 Tanner testified that he had been told
that his son would-be indicted for per
â¢jury if he persisted in his testimony, be-,
fore the Grand Jury, but that if h9
would make a clean breast of his trans
actions and would tell the truth the
District Attorney would recommend^
him for a pardon. ' . * - v â¢ " "
George K. Ogden and James F. Casey,
two clerks in the General Land Office,
who had handled the claim, admitted
In evidence, were called after Tanner
had left the stand, and were used in
identifying the lists and' showing that
they had been made "special" through
the efforts of the Senator. / â¢ .
PORTLAND, June 24.â The cross-ex

stand and was subjected to close ques
tlonlner by tbe . attorneys for the de
fense, some important testimony on be
half of Senator Mitchell apparently
being elicited. 'T, ,x : * .

The family cat sauntered in to see what
was doing. / Solomon seized the animal by,

Isaac Solomon broke out again yester
day. Isaac, is a sort of epidemic when
he gets started. He chose his daughter's
wedding eye as the time for his eruption,
and broke up the ceremony.
The feast was set. the guests were met
in the Solomon home on Twenty-ninth
street and San Jose avenue. All was gay
in, the parlor'until the sound of crashing
crockery was heard in the kitchen.
"It's pa." gasped Mrs. Solomon. '

ber seem palatable to the animal he
practiced a cruel deception upon him.
He bound a pair of green goggles over
the eyes of the horse. The unsuspect
ing equine gazing at the shavings
through the glasses thought that he
had before him a pile of the real
meadow-grown.
With a neigh of grateful apprecia
tion to his master he burled his head In
the manger and seized a mouthful of
Oregon sugar pine. It tasted peculiar
and he looked . again at the pile. It
was green all right and he made short
work of the banquet.

With a foolish leer on his wrinkled
face. William Stubbs. aged 65, mumbled
the words that made him the husband
of 16-year-old Josic Miller before Judge
Cabanlss yesterday. When the cere
mony was performed he hobbled out
of the Hall of Justice,' still grinning
foolishly, accompanied by the young
bride, who could not conceal her con
tempt for him.
The strange couple came here from
Oliver Springs about two months ago.
They had run away to be married.
After being in this city a few days the
wayward g-irl transferred her affections
to a soldier, who took her to a house
of ill-fame. She was found there IÂ»
the police and taken in charge.
As a solution of the problem Juri^e
Conlan offered her the choice of going
to a public institution or marrying
Stubbs. She chose the latter and Judge
Cabaniss performed the ceremony. The
girl visited her soldier lover at the City
Prison the evening before the unholy
ceremony and wept copiously on his
shoulder.
"Guilty, Maud," said the Judge.
"When you emerge from your retire
ment maybe you can form an alliance
with the Czar."

"Do you know this lady?" a3ked the
Judge,
\u25a0 "Yes, Ah knows her, but Ah don't

"Is she a peaceful, well-behaved sort
of person, the kind that makes the dove
seem like a sideshow speller?" '\u25a0;'::"<:
"Ah don't want no trouble. Judge.
But she done busted a banjo over mah
head once and she can clean out a
saloon without a mop any time. Ah
don't want no trouble, but she cer
tainly am a winner in a rough house.
And what a wallop she has with' that
right of hers." Mistah Jackson was
lost in reminiscent admiration.

NEW. YORK, June 24.â There was a j
lull to-day and the two hours' session j
of the Stock Exchange' was rather |
quiet. A disposition was shown to re
duce commitments in the market;- in
view of the Sunday Interval and the
possibility of unexpected' development^
during the suspension of -business.
The clouds on the European political
horizon accentuated this tendency. .A
sharp break in French rentes and 'the
further running off of the sterling rate
at Paris were testimony to the acute
ness of the anxiety over the relations
between France and Germany. -Brit
ish consols were affected in less degree.
Both t of these Government; securities
rallied before the close of the\ markets
in London and Paris, but there was
free selling here for foreign account,
and " tho possibility' of unfavorable de
velopments before Monday was can
vassed. The wheat and cotton markets
showed a yielding tendency and-pros
pects of clearing and warmer wcuther
In the wheat belt. were regarded with
satisfaction, but the commodity mar
kets were also affected by speculative
realizing incident to the closing of the
week. The bank statement revealed a
replenishment of reserves much larger
than was, anticipated, the increase in
cash averages reaching $9,512,200. At j
the, same time a $2,000,000 loan con
traction operated. to relieve the reserve
requirements in proportion. The favor
able bank statement, however, .was
taken advantage of to pursue the pre
vailing disposition to realize, and prices j
ran off after a partial recovery, closing
easy and at about the lowest all around.

Nerve Exhaustion
In Nervous Breakdown, No Matter
What May Have Caused the
Trouble, Electro-Chemistry Is
Directly Curative. In All Nerv-
ous Affections Elsctro-Lhemis'ry
Is Curative Because of Its Direct j
Strengthening Effect Upon the!
Whole Nervous System. !
The giving- away of the nervous sys-
tem is serious. In men the nervous
breakdown unfits them for everything.
Business suffers and there is no capac-
ity for natural relaxation and enjoy-
ment. In women the effects are even
worse. The nervous organization -of
women is more delicate than that ot
men, and when the nervous degenera-
tion begins, the woman naturally suf-
fers more. Under the building-up influ-
ence of Electro-Chemistry the tired,
over-wrought and weakened nerves
rapidly regain strength. The sleep be-
comes refreshing. The Jittle worries of
!ife soon disappear and the big ones be-
come less burdensome, with strong and
normal nerves to encounter their shock.
Medical treatments are woefully weak
in nervous affections.. In fact, in the
majority of cases they are absolutely
worthless. Bromides and chloral quiet
tho. nerves, but they do not cure. Their
continued use not only does not cure,
but they have a harmful and weakening
effect which usually ends in destroying
the nervous system entirely. In the
large Electro-Chemic practice here in
San Francisco a large percentage of the
cases are those presenting different
phases of nervous degeneration and dis-
ease. It is truly wonderful to see what-
this wonderful new treatment is ac-
complishing in cases which are abso-
lutely Incurable under medical treat-
ment. One lady who was so bad that
she was afraid to cross the street a.lone.
after one month's treatment is so well
that she is making arrangements to go
to the Fair in Portland alone. One man
who was so bad that he contemplated
selling a profitable business because he
thought be rould not run it was so
much ber.efited by a short course of
Electro-Chemistry , that he now feels
that he is not only capable of running
the business, but he will soon put In
Additional capital and increase it. A
young man engaged to be married was
on the verge of breaking the engage-
ment and thus probably spoiling the
happiness of two lives. From long
hours and hard work at -bookkeeping
his ' nervous system gave way, but
Electro-Chemistry cured him and he is
now happily wed.

The difficulties opticians have experi
enced in arriving at an accurate diag
nosis of the complaints from which
their patients are suffering have led
to experiments in photographing the
eye. For this purpose an Instrument
has recently been invented, affecting
optical science in general, and the fur
ther development of the eye special
list's profession in treating eye dis
eases and faulty vision In particular.
According' to a German exchange the
assistant of the university clinic of -the
Royal Charity - Hospital, Dr. Walther
Thorner, has succeeded in solving a
problem which had received much at
tention from many others before him,
but with little' or no success. He has
managed to photograph . the back
ground of the eye and obtain good pic
tures of it, too. His Invention repre
sents a material Improvement on the
optbthalmoscope invented by Helm
holu ' In. 1850.. The -atter, however,
only admitted of 'viewing the back
ground of the eye. .
The fact that all attempts to] photo
graph the Interior of the background of
the ere had remained fruitless so. far
was due to the peculiar construction
of the eye." It is. difficult- to light/ up
the interior to such an extent .as. to
enable one to take; a^ photograph of it,
and even in the use of strong sources
of .'light the exposure would ; require so
much time that the eye. would have: to
be fixed, which would mean great; In-;
convenience to \u25a0 the \u25a0 patient.' .; Now' Dr.

OAKLAND, June 24.â While at .work
on a pole near the corner of Twenty
sixth and Valdez streets this morning,
Thomas Doak, a lineman in the employ
of the Pacific States^ Telephone Com
pany, accidentally came in contact .with
a guy wire which in some manner had
become charged from the lines carry
ing the current to Providence Hospital,
and was instantly killed, life being ex
tinct when the body was lowered to the
ground by his fellow workmen.
' The accident occurred at 11 o'clock
while a crew under the direction of
Foreman James McKeehan was at work
building a new line. The wire which
caused the death of .the lineman was
one which, is not used for the transmisf
slon of the current, and not observing
that another i was in contact with" it.
Doak did not attempt to avoid touching
it. He had thrown his safety-belt
around the pole, and a movement : of
his body brought him in contact* with
the guy wire. ; .
As he touched the wire, there was a
slight flash and a moment later- his
body was hanging limp in. the- safety
belt which kept his; body from'; falling,
to the ground. Two of the linemen,
Daniel Powers . and ) Herman' , Holland,
who were working, with Doak, hurried
to the top. of the pole, and cutting the
safety strap/ lowered the body .to the
ground; and it was at once removed; to
Providence Hospital, where'everyj effort
was made to* revive :. the unfortunate
man/but without; success: "There'is no
doiibt that the shock of. the. heavy cur

grew of 505 East Eleventh street, wife of

veloped her 5-year-old daughter. Lucile.
She finally succeeded, but â c child now
lies in a serious condition as a result of
burns, and the mother's arms ; and face
give evidence of the terrible battle ' she
fought for the life of her little one.
The child was playing f with Florence
Latz, a girl about her own age, In the
barn immediately in the rear of the home.
Little Lucile secured a match in some
manner, and ignited a newspaper which
was lying near by. The flames quickly
communicated "to the child's dress and
her companion rushed to the house to
tell Mrs. Mulgrew. When the mother
reached the barn she found her daughter
wrapped In flames, and beat the fire with
her hands in frantic endeavor to extin
guish it. â¢
Mrs. Mulgrew continued her desperate
efforts until J. W* Brown, who was
painting the house, hastened to the res
cue, and "covered the. little girl .with a
painter's cloth. When tÂ».e fire was com
pletely smothered the injured child and
mother were given medical attention.
The former is badly burned about the
face and body, and Mrs. Mulgrew was
burned principally about the face and
arms. ;*'-"?:

REDWOOD CITY. June 24.â Harry Cor
bett of San Francisco has placed the Su
pervisors 'of San Mateo County _ on the
horns of a dilemma. -Under a recent rul
ing of the board the number of saloons
in the county was limited to 105, a suffi
cient number. It was thought, to quench
the * thirst of everybody in the county.
Several appeals were made to increase
the number of licenses, but In every . In
stance they were made in Tain.
Along came Harry Corbett about this
time. He bought the resort known .to
the gay and thirsty denizens of Baa
Mateo and San Francisco as the Four
teen-Mlla - House, or "Uncle , Tom's
Cabin." But Corbett apparently did not
buy i the license to sell liquor at the re
sort.' The owner of that privilege mored
across the street, and took his license
with him. "Uncle Tom's Cabin" without
a license to sell strong waters Is an ex
pensive luxury. .' ." â¢ ; . â¢â â¢
Corbett appealed for a license, and the
Board of Supervisors hesitated. ,ThÂ«
limit - had been fixed and could not be
broken. , If one more license . were given
100 more would be demanded. Corbett
bought a 'license now In effect at Wood
side, and asked that It bÂ« transferred to
the Fourteen-Mile House. Now the Su
pervisors _ are striving to detarmlna
whether a liquor license In Ban Mateo
County is sold to a person or to a local
ity, and upon that decision rests the suc
cess or* failure of Corbett' s venture. Hs
has secured a five years* lease .of the
resort.

OAKLAND, Juno 24. â Vigorous action
on the part of Miss C. Anita Whitney,
secretary of the Associated Charities,
and the publicity given to the story of
his treatment of his sick wife, have
caused James Marks of 241 Hannah
street to quickly take measures to at
least insure the comfort of the aged
woman In the future. Yesterday morn
ing, immediately after the visit of the
secretary on Thursday evening, he hur
riedly summoned Dr. Frank L. Adams
ta attend his wife, and to-day, for the
first' time In many months, so the
neighbors say, he absented himself
from his work at the Judson Iron
"Works to give personal care to the
sick woman. When seen at his home to
day. Marks was at work cleaning up
the' house, the interior of which yes
terday more resembled the hovel of a
band of gypsies than the home of a
man fairly well to do. Beyond giving
a reason for his neglect to secure the
services of a physician for his wife, he
refused to talk of the case. When
Questioned on the subject he said:
"My wife was formerly attended by
Dr. Burchard, and when he died I called
anoiher doctor, who, after one visit
said he could do nothing for her. He
prescribed a course of diet which my
wife did not like, and she would not eat
the things that he ordered, so I made
up my mind that I wou^d not have a
physician who would not allow her to
eat what she liked.
"I did not have any one to take care
of my wife because It would have done
no good, and besides, I do not want
any one around my house when I am
away at work."

the Associated Charities, said this

of intoxication and boasted \u25a0 that he .was

NEW' YORK. June 24. â Captain Xil
sen.'Cocnmandefof the Norwegian ship
Tjomo, has demonstrated his patriotism
and recorded his good stiip rs the first
to clear this port with pa.;<?rs from
which all reference to Sweden had
been eliminated. The biggest Nor
wegian flag Nilsen could find was fly-
Ing from the masthead when the Tjomo
passed down the bay.
The Government, however, has still
the strong backing of the Democratic
p:Â»rty. which is prepared to Intrust the
KtSff and the Ministry with the powers
demanded for untrammeled, negotia
tions in regard to the necessary guar
antees to be given before agreeing to
a dissolution of the. union.
STOCKHOLM. Sweden, June 24.â The
uncompromising element in the Riks
dag is actively prosecuting a cam
paign in favor of presenting to Norway
demands representing Sweden's irre
ducible minimum and obtaining guar
antees from Norway before passing the
bill conferring on the Government
powers to negotiate terms for the for
mal separation of Norway and Sweden.
This faction considers that the Gov
ernment ought to be authorized to con
tract an emergency loan of $25,000,000
Had mobilize troops to support Sweden's
demands.
When it was learned that Butler,
the Australian murderer, had shipped
for this port on the British ship
Swanhilda, some years ago, all the
world watched with the detectives for
the appearance of the windjammer.
The relatives of the ship's present of
ficers and crew, the - marine under
writers and the men who speculate on
the fate of vessels are now waiting
just as -anxiously for some word of the
Swanhilda. She left Greenock 134 days
ago' for Coquimbo and has- not been
seen since. She is counted as long
overdue and has been reinsured for 60
per cent. The schooner Honolulu is
quoted at 65 per cent, and the Cbipper
kyle.at 20 per cent.'

The blow of Friday afternoon caused
quite a big sea, and on the ferry boats,
particularly those plying between' here
and Sausalito and Tiburon. there was
an epidemic of seasickness. .;
The wind moderated in the -afternoon
and the big liner Dakota had no dif
ficulty.in getting away from Broadway
wharf. To Pilot Korts, who so skill
fully docked the leviathan, fell the task
of taking her to sea. and he guided
her back lo 'the outside waters where
he had board ea her! on Tuesday after
noon, and turned her over to her cap
tain with her paint f unscratched.
Korts' docking of the Dakota is still a
popular topic along the water front,
and Captain Francke fof the Hill l liner
goes away with a wholesome respect
for the quality of service rendered by
the bar pilots of this port. He also
thinks that a harbor where Datkotas
can be received and handled with as
little trouble as attends the going and
coming of a steam schooner is just
about right. The Dakota left- Broad
way wharf about 4 o'clock and \u25a0 went
directly to sea.
The northwester which stirred Up
the waters of the bay on- Friday after
noon and evening was still in full blast
yesterday, and during the early hours
increased in velocity until even the
large vessel^ anchored in /the harbor
began to take notice. It was 'the little
craft, however,, that suffered. The
worst of the storm was felt in* Mission
Bay, and the fishing boats in this part
of the harbor' were driven to shelter.
The scow schooner Ajax was blown
against . Mission Rock and held there
until the wind slackened its pace. .
Boating was uncomfortable work all
day, and the officers who came ashore
from the German cruiser Falke f(jund

"The war 'between Spain and the United
States, unfortunate &s it was in many re
spects," said " the doctor yesterday,
"aroused Spain from a lethargic state
and stimulated the patriotic feelings of
her people. !
"That Spain fully appreciates the
greatness of the United States and well
- understands the kindly feeling , which
your people have for the nation which it
but recently conquered, is illustrated by
the forming of a Spanish-American bank
In the city of Madrid, with a capital of
$20,000,000. It was organized for the pur
pose of fostering commercial relations
with this country and is accomplishing
much in that direction.
"Commercially Spain has not been In
;a better condition- than at the present
time for more than a century and her
future Is most promising. One great
benefit the country derived as a result
of the war was the return from the
Philippines, Porto Rico and Cuba of many
\u25a0wealthy Spaniards, whose capital has
been advantageously invested in enter
prises at home and* materially increased
the opportunities of the working classes
to better their conditions."
During the absence of Dr. del Amo in
Madrid the local consulate was in charge
of Vice Consul O. N. "Goldaracena, who
will leave shortly for an extended vaca
tion In the East. . â¢
Dr. G. del Amo, local Consul of Spain,
who has been in Madrid for three years,
returned yesterday and is staying at the
Occidental HoteL The doctor returns to
\u25a0â¢ bis post with much interesting informa
tion concerning his native country, es
. pecially as regards its wonderful progress
since the recent war with the United
States.

;MEN ARE QUESTIONED
The policeman seized his reluctant
follow statue and dragged him from
the pedestaL At the Central Emergency
Hospital Joe wept and said, "Poor fel
low, he catena cold."
"Take that then," said Harrigan and
smote the discoverer of electricity's
metal cranium. The sound showed him
that Ben was not posing under false
pretenses.
'"Come down wan of yez, or I'll come
up," cried Harrigran. The statuary made
no reply.
Harrigan mounted the pedestal and
laid his hand on the coat worn by
Franklin, "Get out of here, move on,"
he ordered. ['. -â¢
No answer from Ben.
The dispute waxed warm, meanwhile
the north wind was biting Into the
hide of the live statue. Suddenly one
of the bronzes sneezed a very un
statuesque sneeze, "Dlo!" yelled the two
Italians, and fled Into the mist.
Their shouts attracted the attention
of Policeman Harrigran, â¢who hurried to
the foot of the pedestaL He looked up
and saw two statues where only one
had appeared before.
"Wan of you come down," he or
dered. "Wan of you is phoney and yez
know it."
.Joe was silent, so was the bronze
Ben Franklin.
Because the Btatue of Benjamin Frank
lin in Washington Square looked cold
last night Joe Tambucci, an Italian,
wrapped it wiÂ«h his coat. Then the con
siderate lunatic stood on the pedestal be
side the bronze statue. "I taka his place.
He pood a man." explained Joe.
Passersby did not notice anything pe
culiar about the statue in passing. It
looked like a group In the mist, for Joe,
when he determined to share Ben Frank
lin's vigil through the night, acted the
rtatue to perfection and the pair looked
like a group.
Joe and Franklin might have remained
undisturbed for the entire night had not
two Italian scavensers got into a dis
pute regarding the identity of the Images
on the pedestaL
"That Georsie da Wash and Pj^sident
Roosevelt," observed the first casually.
"No, yo foola, the big a man is Gari
baldi. The leetle one, he Abe Ruef,"
contradicted the other.

distinction - of " an " Oxford ''\u25a0, honorary : der
gree. Aside from his genius, "the ; Ger
man writer of | tragedies is interesting
because of his versatility ; and 1 his;/ex
tremely unliterary origin. : His father was
a small innkeeperin Silesia and; Haupt
mann got hia. early education- at ;^ the viU
lage school, where, like \" other." geniuses
In the making, he was considered rather
a dunce, .though even .then he \u25a0 showed s a
certain talent for story-telling.'; , He '; first
thought, however, -of : being; . a sculp
tor, and ; he worked at ; It for. a while, but
gradually took. to writing.
At the beginning his luck was bad. Of
his first work, a drama called "Das Erbe
dc s Tiberius." he lost the manuscript. An
epic poem of his in the style of Byron's
"Childe Harold".- was printed, "but after
ward suppressed. Then he wrote a volume
of : poems, but . the publisher who ] accept
ed it failed before the V book: was printed.
An autobiographical novel, on the' lines
of "David Copperflcld,"' started soon'af-'
. terward by Hauptmann, - remains V unfin
ished to th's day. His } first , great sue-,
cess was made with \u25a0 a drama' called : "Die
Weber."; His best; known work is "Die
Versunkcne Glocke." \u0084

Their respective motor cars have been
getting both Rudyard Kipling and Sir Ar-|

The author of ;,"Sherlock ; Holmes" was
In court day. before yesterday, and' flneo
$25 for letting his chauffeur travel on. the
Portsmouth road at more than the legal
speed of twenty miles an hour. . It was
shown. In fact, \u25a0 that Dr. Doyle and > his
man were traveling at \ the rate of \u25a0 over
thirty miles to the sixty minutes, though
the burly novelist declared in court that
he had not thought : his car capable of
that speed. ; ; ,
Rudyard Kipling was motoring through
the village of Robertsbridge, a few days
ago/ when his "- Mercedes \u25a0 frightened . â¢ a
cart-horse. The animal shied ; and his
drive r" was thrown to \ the ground, % his ear
being nearly cut off by one |of the cart
wheels. Kipling , and S the other, folk ;in
the car j promptly offered assistance, . but
this was . wrathfuny , refused by the ' man,
who lost ' a good ; deal of blood ' before; his
vrourid could be properly * stitched by a

Since ' Sienkiewicz ; practically retired
from the literary world, Polish novelists
have j not been doing' much for the inter
national fame^ of their country. .From
Warsaw it is ' renorted that Z an. author
with the sufficiently; imposing -name or
Gansiorowski jls likely to be heard from
presently outside Poland, where his fame
Is already great/ although the sale of his
book has hjeen prohibited in Russia. ; His
latest novel, .- "The Tenth Pavilion," a
grim story of the plots and counter plots
of the Polish socialists and- of. the dread
mysteries of the Warsaw Citadel, is be
ing . translated into . English, with the idea
of introducing ' this author .to England

covered ; 1015% miles.
.The previous record for twenty-four

were favorable, but the yachtsmen were
Inclined to take shortcuts . across the

into deep water. The boats left Bscalle

NEW AUTOMOBILE RECORD
FOROTO THOUSAND MILES
LONDON, June 24.â George Williams,
the fourteen-year-old musical prodigy
who composed an oratorio \u25a0 in three
weeks, is going to America.; One of, his
uncles, David Williams, who occupies
a responsible position with the Car
negie Steel Works in Plttsburg, and Is
now on a visit here, has persuaded the
boy's parents to allow the- lad \u25a0 tofac
company him to j the United States. It
is the uncle's intention to send him to
one of the American colleges where he
will receive a good general education
and at the same time find facilities for
prosecuting his musical' studies.' ..At
present he Is attending, the ; National
School at Chlngford, a village, on the
borders of Epping Forest where -his
parents live. While they are far from
being poverty-stricken, with :\u25a0 a large
family on their hands they cannot;af
ford to give the boy the training need
ed for the development of his undoubt
edly remarkable musical talents.
Williams Is almost entirely ... self
taught. He has never been instructed
In harmony and composition. An old
text" book that fell into ihls hands has
.been his sole mentor .In those | studies.
It : is not contended \ that - any of ; the
compositions he has thus far , produced
will ever rank as masterpieces. But
considering his youth and entire .lack
of adequate training they afford his
friends good ground for the hope, that
if i properly instructed and placed' in ?a
stimulating environment, he may some
day make his mark as a composer.
Anyhow, his American uncle will see
to it that he gets a fair chance. Aside
from his musical gifts there is nothing
about the boy that could be character
ized as precocious.- He has: never\ been
spoiled by flattery and adulation. He
Is a modest younster. - and quite shy
when strangers are around. Nearly all
his spare ttrrie he spends at the piano.
On that account he has not the robust
health of most country-bred boys.
Scec'.al Dispatch to The CalL
So begins an advertisement now ap
pearing In a large number of Journals,
accompanied by a portrait of the
"beautiful English peeress," in which
her ladyship relates "for the benefit of
all sufferers" how she 'was restored to
health after the best professional treat
ment had failed to do her any good.
Lady Haldon was an actress before
she married Lord Haldon. A short .time
ago she "emerged from her aristo
cratic privacy" to appear on the variety
stage. Apparently she has not met
with the financial success she antici
pated and is resorting to other methods
of adding to her income.
The market rate for puffs from
peeresses has greatly, declined of late
years. But since Lord Haldon shows
no disposition to "emerge from his
aristocratic privacy" and replenish the
exhausted exchequer by tackling work
of some sort. Lady Haldon has to do
whatever she can to make both ends
meet. Marrying a peer is not always
all that It Is cracked up to be. â¢ .
'^Really it. is most aggravating," â¢ she
sain. "Here are several American women
prepared to do something worth while, but
we find only the smaller social lights in
town for the season. There is no sense in
doing things on a Bradley-Martin scale
Just to entertain our own country folk.
We want opportunities to do something
which will bring us added glory in aris
tocratic English circles, and procure us
invitations to similar entertainments in
return. It is true Mayfair appears un
usually prosperous, but it is the lesser fig
ures in English society who are practi
cally running the show. For various rea
sons many of the wealthiest and most ex
clusive of the 'bon ton' are beginning to
think themselves poor, and none can go
In for economy harder than the rich when
they imagine they are hard up.
"House agents tell me that English peo
ple who have heretofore ungrudgingly
paid from $5000 to $10,000 for a furnished
house for the season decline this year to
pay more than $2000 or 53000, if they take
a house at all. This affords a fair indi
cation of how society is retrenching."
Many prominent people who have been
generous entertainers .In former seasons
have withdrawn from the giddy whirl
this year. Among them are the Duke ot
Abercorn, whose town house Mrs.* Potter
Palmer was fortunate in securing;, the
Duchess of Bedford, the Marquis of Bath,
Mrs. Wynflnch and several others. Deaths
in their families have caused the tempo
rary retirement of several people who
have previously contributed generously to
the season's gay e ties.
It is not alone the period of mourning
which demands seclusion. The heavy tax
to be paid when deaths cause a transfer
of estates may necessitate rigid economy
for years to make up. The Government
takes Its 10 per cent toll of both the
realty and personalty that changes hands
in this fashion. It has to be paid in cash,
too. The t Marquis of Bath had to pay
no less than $1,000,000 in death dues on his
inheritance. That means that he will
have to spend much less than the income
Irom his property for some years in order
to catch up.
Mrs. Wynflnch's husband was a rich
Welshman, but the death dues she has
had to meet by cash payments have
so crippled her financially that society
will see nothing of her for some years.
"Though sharing the traditional re
luctance of the old nobility to emerge
from aristocratic privacy and come be
fore the public as the subject of a
newspaper article, the Right Honorable
Lady Haldon has expressly permitted
the publication of a statement recently
made to a representative of the press
regarding her wonderful cure by" â a
certain patent nostrum, which there Is
no need to mention here.
LONDON, June 24.â Thus far the Lon
don season has not been a brilliant one,
nor docs the outlook hold much promise
of Improvement. It is true there are
more court functions scheduled than for
a long time past, but so far as its own
diversions are concerned, society has for
the most part contented itself with the
usual round of small conventional affairs,
such as teas, receptions and muslcales.
There have been hardly any big enter
tainments outside of these which royalty
has played the host, and, judging from
recent indications, few such will be given.
Over the teacups the other day, one of
the best known and most successful ot
the -young American matrons here thus
bewailed the dullness of the social pros
pect:
Heavy Inheritance Tax Makes
Deep Inroads in Purses
â¢ of Nobility.

most wonderful curative device that has ever been
"v^^Hi^^ introduced. This Belt is complete with Free Eleo
. .;. '.' -. ' ' . . vinc2ti suspensory* *
This . Electric Suspensory carries the current direct and cures all weaknesses of men, vari-
cocele, etc. It develops and expands all weak nerves and checks a loss of vitality. No case of Fail-
ing vigor, Varicocele or Debility can'resist this powerful Electric attachment. It never fails to cure.
E.F. Lohman, Hooker, Cal., writes: : "The feeling of despondency. ls gone, and I have proper confidence in my-
self now. My kidneys are doing their work, and lam a well man." f
No" man should be weak, no man should suffer the loss of that vitality which renders life
worth living. No'man should allow himself to become less a man than nature intended him, no
man should suffer when there is at hand a certain cure for his weakness. \u25a0
Most of the pains, most of the weakness of stomach, heart, brain and nerves, from which
men suffer, are due to an early loss of nature's reserve power. You need not suffer for this. You
can be restored. The very element which you have lost you can get back, and you may be as
happy as any man that lives.
My Electric Belt, with special Electric Suspensory, will restore your power. It will check
all loss of vital power and affects every organ of the body.
Mr. A; C. Hammond, 330 Pine street, says: "At the age of 75 your Belt has cured me of general weakness
and kidney trouble." . -
I have cured thousands of men who have squandered the savings of years in useless doctoring.
.My /Belt is easy to use; put it on when you go to bed; you feel the glowing heat from it
(no sting or. burn, as in old-style belts), and you feel the ncrv r es tingle with the new life flowing
into them? You get up in the morning feeling like a two-year-old.
An old man of 70 sayshe feels as strong and young as he did at 35. That shows it renews
the vigor of youth. It cures Rheumatism, Sciatic Pains, Lumbago, Kidney Trouble. Banishes
pain in a night, never to return. . . v
What ails you? Write and tell me, and no matter where you are I think I can give you the address of some
one in your town that I have cured. I've cured thousands, and every. man of them is a walking advertisement for
imy Belt. ,
r Every man who uses my Belt gets the advice and counsel of a physician free. ' I give you all that any medi-

to-day, making seven without a miss
for the week. He- will pitch young
Henley In the morning and Dick Wil
liams in the afternoon. The Angels are
rather up against it for pitching talent,
besides being weak with the stick, and
the chances are San Francisco will lead
the pennant chasing procession before
another sun sets. Score:
Spencer opened the eleventh for Uncle
by beating out a bunt along the first
base line. Waldron followed with an
other to Smith, which the latter booted.
Wheeler also dumped one along the
first base line and this tlmÃ'Cap Dillon
was the fall guy. *â¢ He not only juggled
the leather around the bag, but tossed
it away at the first sack.' Spencer saw

The Angels fought the Seals with
every bit of flght they had till the
eleventh spasm yesterday at Recreation
Park. Then they weakened for a single
instant and during that brief intermis
sion Spencer dashed across the plate,
winning the fifth game in a row from
the southern delegation by one little
run. That tally of Spencer's was the
only one marked up during the flght
and it was boosted along by errors on
-the part of Cap Dillon and Jud Smith,
the mainstays of the aggregation.
There was Joy In the heart" of every
fan In the lot. The biggest Saturday
crowd of the season was out and every
man, woman and child present was
rooting for the home team â something
they have not done in this village be
fore for many a day. >
The excitement was intense through
out the battle and especially during
the last few rounds, when both teams
made bids that almost brought victory
home. The fielding was sharp and fast
till Dillon and Smith, fell down in the
eleventh. The Seals were there all the
time after a brief spell of the jimmies
In the earlier stages. â¢ ' - â¢-
Baum was .the victim, of another of
those hard luck conspiracies that have
been his ever since the season opened.
The youngster pitched a magnificent
game, having perfect control at all
times and winging. 'em over "' better
when men were on bases than at any
other time. He really outpitched
Whalen, but had not the support to
carry him through when he needed sup
port most. ,

When Informed to-night of the statement
of Sheriff Herpel of St. Louis County,
Governor Folk said he did not care to be
quoted again on the race track condi
tions In St. Louis County, but that In ad
dition to taking steps to stop the alleged
violations of the law at Delmaf track
he would: take steps forthwith for the re
moval of Sheriff Herpel and County Pros
ecuting Attorney Johnson for their utter
disregard of their official oaths. . ; \u25a0
The arrests to-day were made so quiet
ly that comparatively ; few knew g what
was going on. Two deputy, sheriffs step
ped up to the booths conducted by Will
iam Flynn, president of the Central Turf
Association, and .Charles Noel, and told
the two men they were .under arrest, to
gether with their, six assistants. The
crowd of spectators was hurrying to van
tage points to see the horses go to the
post-in the last race when the eight men
were arrested- and .. their paraphernalia
confiscated. Later they were released on
bonds of $1000 ea.cn. Summary: ,

. "An appeal to bayonets Is the first
threat of a bigot, fired by fanatical zeal,'

in the matter. Further he said: ; â¢ .'*
Senator; Gardner spoke for Sheriff Her^
pel in making*the _ statement and .the^
Sheriff said the 'statement dictated repre
sented his sentiment^ in 'the, present con-v
tingency. The statement follows: -/
"I-am against raiding In the political'
meaning of ' that .term, which' means a"
seizure of persons or property without
legal process, of Jaw. or evidence of vio
lation of the law. A raid, or the use of

said he did not believe in raiding and'
Intimated : if troops were sent into the
county .they might be shot down. '''
He was asked to make an official state
ment and the following statement was

It is to the discredit of the medi-
cal profession that so few physi-
cians recognize I the need oÂ£ better
ways of doings things. Too often \
disease Is treated according to some
ancient rule of practice entirely
obsolete among those more ad-
vanced In the science of medicine.
EveTy method I employ Is based
upon accurate and scientific truth
in regard to the ailment treated,
and is a method original with my-
self. In every instance painful and
dangerous .procedures are entirely,
eliminated. Best of-all,.xny treat-
ment cures â cures thoroughly and
permanently, and In the least time
possible. _ . ' - . '

"WEAKNESS".
. "What is commonly termed func-
tional weakness is merely. a symp-
tom of prostatic. disorder. To stim-
ulate activity by the use of power-
ful tonics is an easy > matter, but
such results are merely temporary
ArjtK effects. Most doctors treat
"weakness" In this manner because
they do not know how to cure the
real cause of the derangement. , I
am 'the only physician employing,
scientific * and successful methods.

Is a local one entirely, and corrects

Following" Is the list of the district
eojnmittees selected for the San Fran
<isc6 Republican League by the citizens
of the respective districts:
* \u25a0â¢ â ~ ay.'.i
The * . Ban Francisco Republican
League^ with an enlisted membership
of 8000 citizens. Is ready to begin the
work of district enrollment: . It would
cot surprise the promoters of the move
i xnent planned to oust grafters and loot
ers from' the City Hall if the "league
membership, after the close of district
enrollment, would approximate 30,000.
The finance committee, William R.
Wheeler chairman, has made a partial
canvass of the wage workers, properly
owners and business men of San Fran
cisco and has given the executive com
mittee of the league assurance that the
cum of $50,000 can be raised by volun
tary Eubscription to assist in organiz
ing forces to redeem the city from the
curse df official delinquency and venal
ity.
At the meeting of SOO leading citizens
In Pioneer. Hall two months ago there
was appointed an organization commit
tee consisting of George D. Clark,
chairman: D. A. Ryan, secretary; Fair
fax H. Wheelan, David Rich, John D.
Daly." Richard J. Welch, E. J. Bowes,
John Lackman, John S. Partridge and
James A. Wilson. Rooms for permanent
headquarters were secured at 636 Mar
ket street, and there representatives
from the eighteen Assembly districts
conferred with the leaders of the organ
353Ltim\. The first proposition adopted by
the .leaders was to recognize In the
broadest and fairest sense the principle
or home rule, and the active workers of
the party in each political subdivision
\u25a0were allowed practically to name the
district committeemen. The work in'
this line was finished yesterday.
A caH has been issued for a meeting
of the Republican County Committee
next Wednesday evening.
The impression prevails that the
County Committee should Indorse and
commend the work of the San Fran
cisco- Republican League. It Is to be ex
pected that some of the county commit
teemen will endeavor to serve Ruef and
Sdunlts by advocating district organ
ization in opposition to the league
'forces.
