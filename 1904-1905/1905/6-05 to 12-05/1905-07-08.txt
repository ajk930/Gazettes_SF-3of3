7 aft Party Reception
Is Surpassing in
Brilliancy.
SALLY SHARP
.Last night at the palatial home of
Mrs. Eleanor Martin the brains, beauty
and wealth of the Queen City of tho
Turquoise Sea made its obeisance to
the distinguished guests within ' its
gatesâ and to Alice, the pet of the na
tion, was paid the homage of the gay
throng.
It had been said that the reception
was to be a co-partnership affair 'twixt
fair Alice and the stalwart Secretary.
Mr. Taft, with their respective corps â
and Indeed the hostess so intended. But
say what you will, when a charming
maid, with a personality all her own, i 3
pitted against a .mere manâ be he
diplomat, soldier, statesman or Presi
dent â he rinil himself In the class oC
the s J!'also'Tttns,"'.wltn*the maiden" U> iliÂ«Â»
forefront with t he " honors.
f'But r Secretary "Taft doesn't careâ not
"be! For in all his eventful life he
never looked happier than last night.
when the daughter of the President â I
his well-beloved chicf â was showered
with the plaudits of San Francisco's
smart set. In point of fact, he liked it
and joyed in it. as becomes a big man,
and Mr. Taft Is big. That cannot be
gainsaid to those who have met him- â
big mentally and physically, and, la
dies, mighty handsome. He's the typo
of man women admire â that is. In hts
evening clothes, it having been denied
me to behold him in his tweeds. 4BH
A great night socially was last night
â a night of the first magnitude, and
wide was the interest therein attested
to by the bourgeoisie gathering about
the Martin home, on the balcony of
which the Presidio band played gay
music that floated oft Into the' warm
summer air.
Within the splendid home, with Its
treasures of art. its rare tapestries, Â»t3
exquisite furnishings, its scintillating'
lights, its prodigality of blossoms, the
picture cannot be. forgot.
In the pink and white drawing-room,
graced with masses of American Beauty
roses, thÂ»- hostess stood to receive her
guests, with Miss Roosevelt at her left
and the rest of the receiving party fol
lowing â a mighty fetching receiving
party, by the way. gowned mostly in
white â all save Miss Alice.
To be sure, you must know what she
wore. I would rather draw Itâ lf I
knew how â than describe it. for it was
the way* she wore it that lent it its
fine distinction. This petted but un
spoiled daughter of the nation wore
at the only formal affair given In her
honor a black clinging sktrt, smartly
cut, with a white draped bodice, show
ins: a splendid gazelle-like throat and
firm white shoulders. Long white glace
gloves finished her costume. Her hair?
That was* worn low at the neck and
drawn back from the face â and she ha*
masses of -It.'
Pretty?
Hardly that. She Is more than pret
ty â she Is wholesome, vivacious, nat
ural. Interested. alert. responsive,
ready of wit and full of action. There
Is about her an air of abounding spir
its, held In check by a strong mental
balanceâwhile she shows all the sisns
of good breeding: and heredity.
During the two hours of tedious, presen
tations, tfils daughter of the house ot
Roosevelt never for a moment lost her
equanimityâ nor her winsome smile.
Mr. Nicholas Longworth?
Yes. he lingered quite close to charm
ing Miss Alice. And Congressman Kaba
vouches for, him as being "a splendid fel
low, with no pyrotechnics, but good
natured.- social and with a lot of manli
ness." That sounds good, doesn't It?
As to the ensemble, there has never
I been, in the modern history of San
\u25a0 Francisco's smart set, a more brilliant
picture. â¢
To begin with, the setting was superb.
with palms. American Beauty roses.
Bermuda lilies and maidenhair fern
everywhere. And as for the womenâ
I just ask Secretary Taf t or any of, the
i gallant chaps- that made *up hi 3 stall
last night. The air was heavy with
exotic compliments to the beauty of
i Western > women â and what do , you
think? â the Eastern ladles joined In the
chorus. V. .
! Quite the jolllest part of the mansion
| was the dining-room, a symphony .la
red. where a buffet supper was served,
with an awfully good brew of punch.".
As to the hostess, there Is thi3 to bÂ«
saidâ she, discharged her obligation as, the
representative society woman . of . San
Francisco in a manner befitting the rank
of" her distinguished guests anrt the dig
nity, of the Queen City of the West. . i;'
And out of. the- whol*-! say. night comes
i the echo, "Alice Roosevett Is a thorougt
breilâand Secretary Ta ft. a good fellow."
May blessings attend them, and all who
accompany them, on the voyass across
the sea.

President Roosevelt paid an apropriate,
and eloquent tribute to the life and serv-;.
ices ol the late Secretary of State John'
Hay in his address before the National
Educational Association at Ocean Grovo
to-day. He followed this wfth -anÂ£ esti
mate of the personal sacrifice Elihu Root
had made In becoming Secretary Hay's
successor in office. The example of these
two men enabled him to point out a most
effective moral. At .the conclusion of his
prepared address the President put .aside
his notes and spoke as follows to the
gieat audience:
DEVOTION TO HIGH IDEALS.
In closing. I want to ?peak to you of -how
certain things, sorn* of which have happened
and some of which have b^en suggested. to me
by what has happened In the paEt week, empha
size what I have said to you as to the experi
ence to this country of having within its limit
men who put the 'realization of high ideals
above any form of money making. \u25a0 . â¢
Within a week this country has lost a great
Ktstesm&n, '.vho was also a great man of let
ters, a man who occupied a picturesque and
unique position in our country, a man of- whose
exiÃtence could each of ui> be proud, for the
United Stales as a whole was better because
John Hay lived. John Hay entered the public
w-rvice when a young man Just- come of age
as the secretary to President Lincoln. He
served 'in the war and was a mernbei*- of 'the
Loyal Lerion. . He , was trusted by â¢ and was,
intimate with Lincoln as hardly any other
man was. He then went on rendering service
after service and was always able at any mo
ment to go to life unless he could con
tinue in pubUcsJife on Mb own terms. He
\u25a0went on rendering service to the country until,
as the cllmajc of his career, he served as Sec
retary of State under two successive adminis
trations and, by what he did and by what *iÂ«
was, contributed In no small degree to achiev
ing for this republic thr respect of the na
tions. Such service as mat could not have
been rendered pave by a man who had before
him ideals as Tar apart as the poles from those
ideals which have In them any taint of what
is base or sordid. :
Now I wished to secure as Mr. Hay's suc
cessor the man whom I regarded as of all the
men in the country the one best fitted to be
such a one's successor. In asking him to ac
cept the position of Secretary of State, I was
asking him to submit to a very gTeat pecuniary
sacrifice, and I never 4hou(?ht of that aspect
of the question, for I knew that he would not
eithr-r. I knew -that whatever other considera>
tions he had to weigh for and against taking
the position, the consideration of how. It might
affect his personal fortune would not be taken
Into consideration by Elihu Root. and. he has
accepte-i
I am not speaking of Hay and Root-as soli
tary exceptions.^ On the contrary, I am speak-,
ing of them as typical of a- larg(s cla^s of men
In public life. Even when, we Tiear bo much
criticism of certain aspects of pur public lire
and or certain of our public servants. It Is well
f<;r us to remember also the other 'Elde of the
picture, to remember that here in America we
now have and always have had at the com
mand ot the nation in any crisis the very best
ability to be found within the nation and that,
ability has been given with the utmost free
dom, given- lavishly and generously, although
at great pecuniary loes to the man giving it.
' There is not in,my Cabinet one man to whom
it is not a financial disadvantage to stay in
the Cabinet. Nor Is there onev who does not:
havf to give up something substantial, some
times what 1r a financial hardship to give up,
in order that he may continue in. the service
of the nation and have only the reward for
whlrh he looks and for which he -cares,' the con-
Kcioiisnpss of having doneservice that was worth
rendering. I hope more and more .throughout
this nation to see the spirit grow which makes
such service possible. I hope to see the senti
ment of thÂ« country as a whole become such,
tfcat each man shall feel borne In on him,
whStfier he Is in public or private life. â¢ and.
minoNyou, some of te greatest public services
can be best rendered by those who are not in
public 15fe. that the chance to do good work Is

part: ,'
The chief- harm done by the men of swollen
rortune to the community is not the harm that
the demagogue is kpt to depict as springing
Irom their actibns.vbut the fact that their
success sets up a false ' standard and so serves
as a bad exampld ,foi>the rest- of. us. If we
did not oruselves attach an exaggerated im
porttance to the rich man who Is distinguished
only. by. his riches, this rich man would have a
most \u25a0 Insignificant influence over us. It 'Is
generally.' our . own . fault if he does damage
to us,? for .he damages us chiefly by arousing
our envy or by rendering us sour and discon
tented. In his.a ctual business relations he Is
much more apt ; to berteflt' than harm the rest
iof us;, and. though It . is." eminently right to
take ; whatever- steps" are 'necessary In order
r-io prevent the exceptional members of his class
from doing' harm, it Is "wicked folly to let
ourselves- be drawn Into any attack upon the"
man of wealth \u25a0 merely as such. Moreuver,'
euoh : an attack is :in -itself an exceptionally
crooked and ugly tribute to wealth, and .there
fore the proof of an exceptionally ugly and
crooked state of mind in the man making the
attack. . .
SKKVII.ITY 'TOWARD WEALTH.
Venomous envy of wealth Is simply another
form of the spirit, which in one ot its manl
f estations . takÂ«s the .shape of. cringing ..servility
toward -wealth, and In' another the 'fchape ' ot
brutal arrogance on the part of certain men of
wealth. Each one of these states of. mind,
whether It be hatred, servility or arrogance,
is dn-reallty- closely akin -to- the other" two;
,for each; of -.them 'springs from ai fantastically
twisted and exaggerated Idedt of the import
ance of wealth, as compared to other- things;
The clamor of the demagogue against wealth,
the snobbery' of,/ the social' columns -of the
newspapers which deal with the doings of the
wealthy and the misconduct of those men of
wealth' who act- with brutal disregard of the
rights of others, seem superficially to have
no fundamental relation; ytt in reality" they
spring from shortcomings which are
mentally the same; and one of 'these ehort
comings is the failure to have proper Ideals.
- This failure must be remedied In large part by
the action of you and your fellow-teachers,
your, fellow-educators throughout this land.
It is absolutely necessary to earn a certain
amount of money; it Is a man's first- duty to
tnose dependent upon him to ram enough for
their support;^ but after a certain point has
been reached money-making can never stand
on the same plane with other and nobler forms
of effort. The roll of American worthies num
bers men like Washington and Lincoln, Grant;
and. Farragut, Hawthorne and PoÂ», Fulton
and Moree, Bt. Oaudens and MacMonniesi.lt
numbers statesmen and soldiers men of letters,
artists, sculptors, men of science. Inventors,
explorers, roadmakers. bridge- builders, phil
anthropists. . moral leaders in great- reforms;
it numbers men who have, deserved well in
anyone of countless fields of activity; but of
rich .men -It numbers -only those "who have
used their . richps aright, who have . treated
wealth not as an. end. but as a means, who
have shown good conduct in acquiring it and
not merely lavish generosity in disposing of It.
Thrice â¢ fortunate are, you to whom It Is
jriven ' to ; lead lives of ; resolute endeavor for
the achievement 'Of lofty Ideals, and,' further
more, to -instill, both by your lives and by
your ( teachings, these Ideals i Into the " minds
of thoise who \u25a0In the . next generation will, as
the men and women ot that generation, deter
mine the position which this nation will hold
In the history, of mankind. â¢.

were made by John R. Kirk, president of
the State Normal School at Kirksville;
Mo., and Miss Katherlne Blake, principal
of; public school No. .'6. New York City.
Miss Blake's response was a notable one.
She pronounced an - eloquent eulogy on
the President, concluding with these
words: " ,
"He is -a greater teacher than any
among us. We are teachers of children ;
he la a teacher, of men, a teacher of na-;
tiona.' He is not only 'the President of
the United States, but also the best loved
man !n all the world."
As the President shook hands with Miss
Blake: at the conclusion of her , address,
the audience rose to lta feet and cheered
for nearly a minute. It had been the
President's ' intention to make another ad

KANSAS LOSES
OIL REFINERY
Supreme Court Decides That
< tlie Xaw; Providing for
Its Erection Is Illegal
OPIMON IS
Judges Hold -That/Legisla
tive Act Is in Violation of
'Constitution of the State
TOPEKA, Kan., July. 7.â The law pass
ed by the Legislature Iftst winter ap
propriating $410,000, t0 build an indepen
dent oil refinery at Peru" was to-day de
clared unconstitutional by the State Su
preme" Court In an opinion ' rendered by
Associated Justice Thompson. ,
The oil. refinery law -1 was considered . one
of; the) most direct blows struck at the
Standard. Oil Company by thelast Leg:s
lature tending to restrict the concern in
.the handling of the Kansas product.
The \u25a0 oil refinery law provided for the
.erection at Peru, also of a branch of the
State ; penitentiary to house .'prisoners,
who,* it was intended, were to work the
oil plant. State Treasurer Kelly and
Warden E. B. Jewett, "whose duty it was
to,lssue the bonds, declined to sign them
In; order toflrst secure a decision on the
'constitutionality â¢\u25a0 of :-. the 'act. Attorney
General C. : . C' Coleman - filed â¢ mandamus
! proceedings in the State Supreme Court
on- behalf . of the State' to compel those
officers to sign J the honds. : | The opinion
to-day- declaring the act .to be.'illegarand
unconstitutlonal^.was concurred', in by all
of the members of "the ; . Supreme Court.
\u25a0.The courtholds that the construction of
'the refinery and, the branch penitentiary
in connection with < it 'is in" violation of
the State" constitution which declares
.".The State shall- never; be a party In
carrying! on any works of internal Im
provement." , .
"- The:construction and operating of such i
a refinery, it. is held; would be a work ot
Internal^.improvement. ; .
'.The court reviews the discovery of
great quantities â¢ of oil in' the State's
rapid, development; and "the general pub
lic complaint that a particular corpora
tion was unjustly manipulating the mar-
Ket of this product so that the producer
was being deprived of what rightfully be
lqnged; to' him," and : that.-a public de
mand had -been .made, upon the Legisla
ture to enact "laws to protect the pro
ducer. .'The court by Inference criticizes
Governor Hoch for; using a scarecrow
to frighten the oil trust, so-culled, and
for informing the trust that the thing he
has set up is a scarecrow. \u25a0 . â¢ -
"The indictment of the Standard Oil
Company/ says the court, "is no doubt
true and the provocation was very great,
but we must not make a scarecrow of
the-law."
Governor Hoch was greatly disappoint
ed at the decision and said:
"Now that we have started it, I wanted
to go on and tun bur refinery. We would
have secured more than /its cost in the
price of oil in a few months. .'lf I had.
been the Supreme Court â¢ I would haVe
strained a point to have declared the
law constitutional." .
CHANUTE, Kan., July 7.â W. S. Hyde,
president- of the Chanute and Austin Oil
Refinery Company, said of the Supreme
Court decision: .
."This, decision of the court will not In
jure the independent refinery. In fact It
is a benefit owing to \ the removal of
State' competition. "Our success depends
. upon the anti-discrimination law and
on securing fair rates for transportation.
We can fight the Standard just as well
without the State." -

The new Embassador has taken tem
porary quarters at the New Willard
Hotel. His first official action was to
call on Count Cassini at the Russian
embassy. He attended a luncheon there,
which was given by the retiring Embas
sador to the membres of the embassy
staff. Later in the day Baron Rosen paid
his^respects to Acting Secretary of State
Pierce, who will communicate with Presi
dent Roosevelt for the purpose of â¢.fixing
a date for. Baron Rosen's . reception.
When he goes to Oyster Bay, Baron
Rosen, in addition to presenting his own
credentials, will convey Count Cassini's
letter of 'recall. *V;-" \u25a0 .-v;i -
There will be no meeting between Baron
Rosen and Minister Takahira. who is one

any communication between them until
the envoys of the two Governments have
been received at Oyster Bay by the Presi

KANSAS OUSTS
GAS COMPANY
Supreme Court of the State
Decides That Concern Has
Xo Eight to Do Business
TOPEKA. July 7.â The State Supreme
Court to-day rendered a decision declar
ing that the Kansas National Gas Com
pany, a Delaware corporation, may not
do business in Kansas. The decision,
which is sweeping in its terms, makes an
outlaw of the company, which it declares
may neither hold property In Kansas nor
operate In any manner within the State.
The company already has spent several
million dollars in laying pipe lines in
Kansas 1 .
The opinion was rendered in the case
of the State of Kansas against the Kan
sas National Gas Company. When the
company applied to the Kansas charter
board for permission to do business in
this Stater the board denied tie. appli
cation. ; However, the. company* > went
ahead laying its pipes and contracting to
deliver, gas to many cities. To date the
company, has expended millions ot dol
lars laying pipe lines from the southern
Kansas fields to the Missiouri line and
to a dozen or more cities /bt Northern
Kansas.
After the charter board had acted, the
Attorney General, In the name of the
State, brought this proceeding in quo
warranto against the company, asking
that It be required to show its authority
for doing business in Kansas and IX un
able to do so It be ousted from the
State. The company answered, setting
fSrth its application to the charter board
and alleging that it had done all things
required by the statute and asking that
the charter board be ordered to grant
the license. A demurrer to this answer
was filed. The court sustained the de
murrer and entered a judgment against
the gas company.
The barred company' owns a majority
of the producing gas wells . in Kansas
and is capitalized at $10,000,000. It has
spent six months in constructing: the pipe
line from Montgomery County to Kansas
City. The company was just on tho
point of piping gas into Kansas City,
Kansas, Lawrence. Topeka. Ottawa and
many other . Kansas towns, but under
the terms of the decision it must . cease
all work in Kansas.
The court goes far enough to intimate
that the company has exhausted its re
sources at law and says that it cannot
come Into court and ask for a manda
tory order to compel the State charter
board to grant it a license. r*-.";r *-." ;

WAR SECRETARY SPEAKS AT BERKELEY
Continued from Page 1, Column 6.
other words the leisure class, for lack of
a better term, in the next generation, the
leisure class of educated men Is bound to
be much larger in proportion \to the
general population than in the present;
that is, it is bound to be so unless the
sons of the fathers of to-day will inherit
with their capacity for making money
their intense desire to make it.
â¢ "Now, I hope that they will not do so.
I have no fear but that there may re
main in this country a sufficient desire
to acquire wealth to keep the wheels, of
industry going; but "It seems to me ot
the utmost importance to this nation
that there should be a large c.'ass of men
able to live on accumulated capital of
previous generations who do not regard
the chase of the dollar as the highest
aim in life and who do regard the wel
fare of the public as their particular
interest.
"Therefore it is that such an institution
as this that is pouring out year after
year young men of education and of high
ideals, who doubtless will be able after a
few, years to give their entire time to the
benefit of their fellows, becomes such an
important element in the saving and
safety of this' country.
Brakes Must Be Set.
"We have tendencies in this country
that If allowed to rule will carry us over
the precipice to destruction, and we must
look about to see what are the \u25a0: brakes
that will be put on. It is not enough of
a justification for a man to ' give up a
life ot usefulness to the public that he
may earn a little more money for his
children, provided the position that he oc
cupies is one in which he may give. them
an education and then turn them out
upon the world to * earn â¢ that which they
will have a great motive for earningâ their
own livelihood and their, own future. The
truth is, and I know there is many a
father that believes it, ; the truth is that
to-day the heaviest burden that a father
can leave to a* son beyond an education
is a , fortune which shall enable, him to
live In luxury, unless that | fortune is ac
companied with a teaching and j implant
ing in the young man. of : a .sense; of re
sponsibility to the public and his \ fellow \
men, of devoting his life industriously to
their welfare. ; V "
"The wealthy young men of the country
have not had fair treatment. It is those
of us that when we got : our education
had to hustle beyond that, who \u25a0 had the
great advantage in: life;; "because .the
necessity ; is a r spur . that', overcomes all
temptation to luxury and laziness; and. in
looking forward with I the hope that | there
may be hereafter such a 'class 'of \ young
men as I have described I am not blind to
the obstacle to that hope, I am not blind
to the difficulty that there j may, be in the
creation of such a class in the disposition
of every man when ,he has enough -to
make; himself _ easy; and , pleasant ito con
tinue In. easy and pleasant : ways. ;/'; ,
Must Teach People.
'.Xadies and gentlemen, when I last had
the \ opportunity ;. of =; addressing you we
were" about *to the :' great I task
of establishing a Government in the Phil-
Ipptae; Islands.;- We) have i done ; so.^.What
the defects ;of;that:Government i are J I ; do
not this afternoon propose to discuss. : No
one', can be more '\u25a0 conscious- of 'J the : : de
ficiencies^ that : do , exist ; there "[ than I those
that have^had.to do with Its construction
and maintenance; but I beg to remind you
that ,the principle .upon'i which that Gov
ernment has , been | established,;: even : ; if
at times the . principle^ has ; been! Ignored
or *. violated,' is 3 the ; principle \ upon \ which 1
In ; past ; history ..-^no ; other ; or* de-"
pendent Government has been established,*
and that is, the obligation of the mother
country, the country assuming to estab
lish the Government, of teaching the
people over whom It put a Government
how to govern themselves.
; "That proposition depends upon the pos
tulate that the people are not now able to
govern themselves. A good many, of us
have had experience and believe con
scientiously "that they are to-day entirely
unlit to govern themselves and will be for
one or two or .perhaps three generations.
That being the case, then It Is our duty
to tell. them so and have them understand
that during that time the question will
be not what kind of a government they
will have after they become independent
but what kind of a government they have
under' the, American sovereignty., "
"Now, we have had the disadvantage,
it may be a disadvantage, of differing
with our fellows as to the question
whether we \ were right first in establish
ing their unfitness to govern themselves,
and second, taking that and attempting
to govern them. We have gone so far
along now in the. problem that I venture
the prediction that no American adminis
tration, 'Republican or Democratic,' will
venture to depart from that principle, and
I say this for .the benefit of my young
Filipino friends who are r here, because
it is. well they should, learn the truth.
Will Maintain Riile.
"It is well they should have the cold
facts, and taklne the cold; facts, that
they, should go on helping their, own peo
ple and helping their government In a di
rection which; will be helpful instead of
writing disquisitions on the subject of ab

that of the Spanish, .in which the' Go
vernment is everything, in which the
machinery of the Government was not
for the -use of the individual, but for
the Government, cannot learn civil lib
erty in .a single generation. You can
declare and you can furnish the instru
ments, for civil liberty, but unless a
man knows that he has the right to
use them, that civil liberty is as if it
did not exist.
"When you take six millions of peo
ple who speak ten or eleven different
dialects, not more than ten per cent of
whom- speak any modern language, it
is not to be expected that they can
takein.in a year or two years or three
ye.ars, indeeilj that they can take in In
any other way than through their edu
catedchildren,. knowledge of what civil
liberty Is rind of the
that it Imposes upon .them on the one
hand and of the. means by Â»whlch It Is
to be asserted on the other. That being
the case with respect "to our Filipino
friends, what Is our duty? It is first
to have. them understand that the Gov
ernment of the United States In those
Islands is supreme and will be supreme
Indefinitely; .while we work out - the
problem,' which we recognize as our
obligation .to work out, in teaching
them to govern themselves.

"Now the first step recognized by
everybody is the step of . their educa
tion, and I rejoice to say that the great
foundation: for our hope that they may
be ' made a self-governing people is the
avidity with' which the ignorant
fathers and mothers and the. little chil
dren^ themselves seek the; opportunity
to learn the -English language j and ; the
primary: education which 'Is no w \u25a0 being
furnished them in the islands.' \u25a0 Some of
our,. critics -^havev said, that we .were
forcing \ that : education down " thoir
throats.; Now that is not-true, first,
because ; we*" have no compulsory edu
cation ; law In, the I Islands . an 1. second/

\u25a0 "Allen :v Ireland,* Mr. â¢" Calhoun, Mr.
Foreman i cannot ,; say J too : much. : about
the lack of wisdom that we have ex
hibited in attempting to educate these
people and they are constantly refer
ring to the success that their people
have made in English colonies. I do
not wish to detract from that at all.
The success that they have made in
many respects is phenomenal, but they
utterly lack, they utterly losei the
point of what -..we are trying to do in
the Philippine Islands. They are at
tempting to build up a government
arbitrary but beneficial, to continue
permanently in that form which shall
do good to the people, but which shall
retain them in their present state of
illiteracy, in their, present state of ab
solute ignorance of how to govern
themselves, but which shall favor trade
for them and trade for. England or
France or Holland, as the case may be.
"We, on the other hand, having been
forced into the situation in which we
find ourselves, having these people on
our hands as wards, are attempting
now, because we believe that a popular
self-government in the end is the best
Government, to. teach these people how
to conduct a popular self-government,
and we find, as I say, this material
which the Englishmen and the Dutch
men have not found, to wit-^-a body of
Malay Christians/who being Christians
have Christian Ideals and look therefore
to Europe and America for their high
est ideals.' That make 3 the difference
between the problem which we are at
tempting to solve and that which the
Englishmen and the "Dutchmen have
solved In a very commendable way, I
agree, in the East Indies. - 4
"Now, ladles and gentlemen, you must
excuse me for going into the question
of the Philippines because 1 1 have not
much else to talk about. This. is the
second speech within twenty-four hours
that- the hospitality of California has
evoked from ; me. and It is beyond my
capacity to make a different^speech
every twelve hours. We are going, a
band of gentlemen earnestly Interested
in the welfare of the Philippine Islands.
Trip Will Do Good.
"I consider It a great triumph that we
have been able to enlist the Interest ana
the ; sympathy of seven distinguished
United States Senators and twenty-three
Representatives of the House of Repre
sentatives of the United States, who havo
been at a very considerable cost
to each ; person and also at a very con
siderable cost 3of time to devote : a hun
dred, days to going out Into those Islands
In a season when we must ! expect storm
and rain. , In order, that they * may know
the facts concerning them. I think It -Is
an exceptional Instance of the degree of
self-sacrlflce to which our legislators
and those who are responsible to us for
government ' are willing to make, "* - '-\u25a0â¢" * :
\u25a0[â¢Now, we ; do not agree in . this delega
tion on many political points, and It la
quite possible that .we .shall disagree In
respect to many points ; in : the Philippines.
The gentlemen have been invited without
regard to their political creed'or "previous
condition *of \u25a0 servitude.*. .There is i every
evidence â¢ that swe are going ; to get along
harmoniously, however ; : much , .we ' dis
agree. ;VWe 'know that we must all stand
together ; In -order; that -. we ] shall enjoy
this" trip or .we may 'all hang separately/.
I ; think ; that , the ; trip Is " a unique one ; : in
the i history; of the country," and of course
we TcaH\tell . a h little better, about its use
fulness after we return;, but certainly
the x spirit " in .which "\ it : has been Degun
gives ' every * evidence . that when we do
return .we "shall find In" Congress,' of which
this ywiU \be leaven,' a . quickening In

we * shall all \ approach 1 the question 'â¢ from
a practical standpoint of a desire to do
the best for those people.
"It gives me great pleasure to express
the sense of hospitality that all my com
panions and myself feel toward you. the
kindly people of California, for your ex
pressions of good will and for the com
pliment . which you do us in coming here
in such unusual weather to hear a desul

Short speeches were also made by
Representative DeArmond of Missouri
and Representative Sereno E. Payne of

SWEDEN'S FKONTIEK
CLOSELY GUARDED
Precautionary Pleasures Be
ing Taken Because of â¢
Norway's Attitude.
STOCKHOLM. July 7.â There is high
military authority for the statement
that Sweden is taking precautionary
measures on the frontier to offset the
reported threatening attitude of Nor
way..
.The Swedish treasury to-day borrowed
$6,500,000 to pay extraordinary expendi
tures. It is rumored that two high Nor
wegian officers have been arrested at
Christianla because they refused to for
swear allegiance to King Oscar. The
rumor, however, has not been confirmed.
Prominent merchants confirm a report
that â¢ capitalists are withdrawing their
funds from Norwegian banks.

Visits the Army
Posts About Bay
in the Morning
. Secretary Taft began the day yesterday
with a tour of the bay. A review of the
troops stationed at the Presidio followed.
He left ti-e transport dock promptly at
7:30 in the morning on the tug Slocum,
accompanied by only the official mem
bers of his party. The company was re
ceived on board the army tug by General
Sumner and his aid. Lieutenant J. A: Hig-
Cms. General Frederick Funston, Major
C. A. Devol, and Major Cassius E. Gil
lette. Captain E. P. Jervey Jr. was also
in the party, having been appointed as a
special aid to the Secretary. : . !
The tug first steamed slowly , around
Angel Island that the Secretary, might
have a full knowledge of,its size and situa
tion. It has been proposed to set aside a
part of the island for a detention camp
for immigrants. The military authorities
have always had full possession, aru. they
arc averse to yielding up any portion to
the Treasury Department/The question
is one that will- be decided later on by
Secretary Taft.
The Slocum next sailed close to Fort
Baker and Point Bonita and' then headed
fur the Presidio dock.

a large number of lives that are now
lost; on account! of- the rapid advance
of the disease. j

Gale Johnson of California was assas

decidedly popular among the American
residents of Uiique. At the time of. his
; death he was in company with General

Rocha accosted the general manager
in an insolent manner and complained
that his pay envelope lacked three pesos
of being the -reu'tired amount. Manager
Rahn told him to file his complaint with
'the timekeeper. The Mexican insisted
on immediate payment and General
Manager Eahn knocked him down with
a cane. Arising, the Mexican stabbed
"Rahn. Johnson, rushed to the rescue,
and the Mexican turned upon him,- in

Rochu was arrested by the police and
an extra guard has been placed around

Vice Admiral Kruger's Black Sea fleet; that a fierce battle was fought, -in* .which: many* lwere killed or wounded, espe
cially on the rebel ship, and that eventually the mutineer escaped. Thef steamship Alexei, overdue at this port, is said
to have been held up. by the Kniaz Potemkine, which carried off five army officers who were found aboard,- among
them two generals.

â¢ iinwiri entered the outer harbor and
Kiirhoreil near the Roumanian cruiser
LTlisebata.
The authorities of the town are anx
iously watching: to guard against any
aurprlÂ»e movruirnto and much excite
ment prevail* throughout the tovru.
ST. PETERSBURG, .'uly 8. 2:30 a. m.
According to the latest reports the
Kuiaz Potemkine has esc: ped her pur
suers and its still at larjje in the Black
tea, with the torpedo-boat Smeltilvy
and the Black Sea fleet hot on her trail.
There is little doubt that she is head
ing for Poti or Batoum, Dut no dis
patches from eith- ice had been re
ceived up to 2 o'clock this morning.
Advices received by the Associated
Pro.Â«s indicate that the tension is in
creasing in t". \u25a0 Caucasus, where the
turbulent elements arc excited ever re
ports i â rding the condition of the
fleet. Increasing the fear that the ar
nval of the Kniaz Potemkine at a port
of the Caucasus will have the effect of
pouring oil on the smoldering flames.
A bomb was thrown at Tiflis to-day.
GETS SI' PPL Y OF FUEL.
Rebel Battleship Coals From a British
Vesucl Which She Seized.
ST. PETERSBURG, July 7.â The
Kniaz Potemkine escaped from Theo
dosia be-fore the Black Sea fleet arrived
thcrp from Sebastopol. The advices
received by. the Admiralty, however,
are meager and most conflicting. It
is considered that "Ensign and Quar
termaster" Alexieff, who commands the
Kniaa Potemkine. was advised of the
fleet's "coming and left TheoJosla. At
any rate it is clear ..nat she coaled from
a British, ship which she seized, and
their saijfd -away. The reports as to
the direction taken by the Kniaz Po
temkine do not agree. Admiral Wire
neus, chief of the general staff of the
navy, says that one report said that she
had sailed westward in the direction of
. Livadia, raising the suspicion that it Is
tljft intention of her crew to bombard
the Emperor's summer palace. An
. other ru 1 " 01 " said that when the Kniaz
Poremkii," e w *s last seen she was head
ed sv,,rneast as if bound for the Cau
casus littoraL This subsequently was
supplemented by a report from Sebas
topol that the Kniaz Potemkine had
put into Tuapse, half way to Poti, and
had been captured in some mysterious
fashion by soldiers.
The torpedo-boat destroyer Smeltilvy,
manned by a crew of officers and blue
jackets who volunteered to sink the
mutineer, reached Theodosia several
hours after the Kniaz Potemkine had
departed and after hurriedly coaling
the Smeltilvy put to sea in pursuit of
the rebel battleship.

provisions because the populace pleaded
that only in that way could he save the
city from destruction The Governor says
that when the torpedo-boat in the hands
of the mutineers and a cutter tried to
come in shore yesterday morning for a
parley, the troops fired on them, thirty
sailors being killed or wounded. Upon
the return of the boats to the battleship,
the latter, instead of exacting vengeance
by shelling the city, weighed anchor and
steamed away.
The Governor expressed the opinion
that the career of the Kniaz Potemkine
will soon be ended. He says that a sailor
who jumped overboard and swam ashore
during? the night reports that a condition
bordering on anarchy exists on board the
battleship. There is much drunkenness,
the men reeling about the decks and there
are many wounded men. Typhus has
broken out on the Kniaz Potemkine.
More than half of the crew, together with
eight petty officers, are in favor of sur

the mercy of the authorities, but they
are powerless against the mutineers who
have all the arms. The ringleaders con

after putting his grips into a hotel bus,
he went up Washington street, leading to
the heart of the city. '\u25a0"":,\u25a0 '
A t few blocks fro m tne, station was a
second band store and into this he darted,
telling, the proprietor he wanted to. buy
a revolver, as somebody "had tried to
hold him up last night." ,\u25a0 The - pawn
broker handed him a loaded weapon for
which he ; asked $5. While Weiser's at
tention was diverted to the money drawer
Boyd placed the â¢ muzzle' of the revolver
In his mouth and pulled the ' trigger.
Death was instantaneous. The. 'bullet
shattered his mouth and came out of the
top cf the head, and penetrated the ceil
ing almost above his. form..

her husband did not curse her and
otherwise treat her in 'a cruel and in

exhibited a pistol, she alteges, and
threatened to end her life. He gave her
but $10 a month to support herself and
their child, ehe says.

Hopes He Can Reach
Them Spiritually
the Better.
OAKLAND, July 7.â That he may fa
miliarize himself with the trials, tribu
lations and temptations of the vast
army of railroad men in Oakland,
Rev. Dwignt E. Potter, pastor of the ]
Union Street Presbyterian Church, to
night began work as an ordinary engine 1
wiper in the West . uaklanu railroad
yards. Attired in blue, overalls and with
a bunch of waste in his hand, Mr. Potter
quietly crawled under a hot, dirty loco
motive and set upon his Irksome task.
The pastor's church is located in the
West Oakland district, not far from the
yards of the Southern Pacific Company
and the many large manufacturing estab
lishments. His sympathies have always
been with the men who work with their
bands, and his ambition has been to bene
fit them In any way that lay in his power.
He wants to work and live with the rail
road men, whom he wishes to reach in
a spiritual way and to come into intimate
contact with them in pursuit of his so
ciological studies.
Application was made by Mr. Potter to
Division Superintendent Scott for a job
in the railroad yards. It took some little
correspondence between the division eu
perintendent and General Superintendent
Palmer, but the order- for the employment
of the minister as an ordinary working
man was finally issued. It was Mr. Pot
ter's desire that he be permitted to -work
in every department for a short time, and
he chose the very humble, position of en
gine wiper to begin with. He asked, that
he be given just exactly the treatment
that would be accorded the newest and
greenest hand on the road. The young
preacher was given just what he asked
for and was told to report on the night
shift for duty. â¢â¢Â»
He proceeded energetically with his
work, crawling over and around the big
locomotives that brought the evening
trains off the road, until he was hot,
dysty, dirty and thoroughly tired. But
the enthusiastic young minister did not
falter and despite tne unusual character
ol the weather, that tried older and more
seasoned men, he remained with his shift
all through the night.
The i' pastor did ' not \\ return to his own
bed early this morning- He 'had hired, a
small rcom in .. a West â¢ Oakland ; lodging
house that is the home "of : many 1 of the
laboring men - who . are -employed -in the
West Oakland yards. He deslres-that his
experience should' be. tnorough. His mid
night luncheon was carried in "a small
basket, and' when he ate It -sat' on the
side -of the engine pit In the round house.
His breakfast was eaten in a email res
taurant that is frequented by the rail
road ' men. '"-\u25a0;\u25a0 \u25a0 -
Close association with workingmen - Is
not nÂ«w to Mr. Potter. For some months
he has been living In a .odging house,
eating at a small restaurant, and coming
in dally communication with the men who
work on the railroad. Now he proposes
to work with them, and share their daily
tcft.' The young minister will' work his
way through the yards, in every depart
ment where unskilled or partly skilled
labor is required. He will learn to be a
switchman, how to work in the car re
pair department, how. to beat out the up
holstered seats and the fancy carpets of
the Pullman sleepers, and how It' feels to
be the "green man" in all departments.
Said Mr. Potter to-day:
Â§Â£I have, already been working through
the railroad yards for some time, and I
have found the men who play so"import
ant a part in the affairs of the country
as the railroad operatives to be sympa
thetic,' earnest and sincere. Some of the
best friends I have are among the rail
road men, and now I propose to see just
exactly what their dally toil is like. I
want to know about their daily life, their
trials and troubles, and so I have de
cided to wcrk with them as long as I
can remain upon this coast. I shall be
compelled to go East shortly, and so the
development of my plan has been
hastened a little.
"I originally expected to go to Sacra
mento and seek employment in the shops
there incognito, but this was thwarted
by the hastening of my departure for the
East. I shall now work through the va
rious departments in , West Oakland as a
green hand, and try to rind out just what
it is like -to 'break in* for the railroad
service. There is a Email army of rail
road men In Oakland,* and if there is any
chance I propose to reach' them."

DANGER BY FIRE
IS MINIMIZED
Sausalito Secures Privilege
of Using the Kailroad Com
pany's Pumps and Mains
BOON TO TEE KESIDENTS
New- Arrangement, It Is Said,
Will Bring About a Seduc
tion of Insurance Bates
Special Dtawtch to Tt* CalL
SAUSALITO, July 7. â Tho danger from
fire in this town will at an early date be
minimized, especially In the business sec
tion and the residence section on the' bill
within a short distance from the main
street A short time ago Town Trustee
VT. J. Martin asked President A. W.
Foster of the North Shore Railroad Com
pany for permission for the town to con
nect Its salt water mains with the Nortn
Shore Railroad fire mains, which are
supplied by an electric pump with sale
water at the rate of SOOO gallons a min
ute, and the use of the pump in case of
fire. President Foster, with - his usual
generosity, granted the town the priv
ilege, the town to stand the expense of
making the connections.
There is no doubt that the town trus
tees will, at their meeting Monday nigbi.
accept Foster's kind offer and order the
connections made. The use of the electric
pump in case of fire means a great dear
to the business men of this place, as it
will affect the Insurance rates. Some of
the business men are paying as high as
JI 50. which Is very steep, and they ex
pect that their rates will be materially
reduced by the new arrangement.
Sausalito lately secured a plentiful
supply of electricity for lighting ana
power purposes at a 50 per cent reduction
from former rates and a night and dar
service. How to secure a plentiful supply
of water for domestic purposes, some
thing that Is greatly needed here. Is the
question now bothering the trustees.

It was only after, a desperate battle that

ing clothes from Robinson and extin
guishing the flames. He was considerably

which left here June 24 for Coos Bay. came
In eight. Frcm the Esther Buhne's well

JOHN McXAUCITT. âJ^.-J^HIH â¢â¢ '\u2666 Manager
PUBLICATION OFFICE THIRD AND MARKET STREETS, SAN-FRANCISCO
SATURDAY , â¢â¢ â¢ â¢ JULY 8 ' 1905
REGISTER FOR THE PRIMARY.
FROM the expressions dropped by Eastern visitors it is evident
that the reputation of San Francisco is : at stake in the coming
election. The salvation of the city's fair name is to begin with
the August primary. The registration of voters closes on the 19th
inst. After that, if a citizen is not registered his vote cannot be
cast, and no matter how much he may deplore the government un
der which the city suffers, he must 'accept his share of the guilt
as a consequence of his indifference to his duty.
The conditions here, related to the municipal government, are
growing worse instead of better. Heretofore it has been the odium
of the city government that the instruments of power were used
for partisan purposes, when the whole people, and not one party, are
entitled to their equal use as the agencies of government. The new
charter was demanded because it was supposed to make impossible
this conversion of public authority into partisan power. This hope,
planted in the charter, has proved to be vain. The fact is now dem
onstrated that the best form of government can be subjected to the
basest uses, if its administration be intrusted to unfit men.
There is no charm in a charter nor fundamental law that can
save a city from the evils of graft and greed, and the other im
moralities of government. That depends solely upon the men who
administer it. The people of this city have now been made aware
that there is a depth beyond the partisan use of power and that the
charter, in bad hands, becomes the means of sounding that depth.
It has been brazenly shown that public authority is here made the
instrument of personal purposes, and that it is used in visiting pun
ishments and conferring rewards entirely personal in their nature.
When the president of one of the great city boards, discussing
his personal grievances and uttering his desire to punish his personal
enemies by a perversion of public authority, says, boldly, "As I
have the power I'd be a fool not to use it," it is time for decent
citizens to get together and do some thinking. Men who will use
public authority in a private feud will use the same authority to re
ward their own feudists by public robbery if necessary. There can
be no more serious abuse of power than this, for it includes all
forms of abuse. It is the bold assertion of autocracy in municipal
government. Every citizen of this city is entitled to the rights,
privileges and freedom given to him in the charter and the law.
The hatred of the Mayor or president of the Board of Works or
of the Police Commission cannot nullify those rights', for. they arc
conferred by the law and cannot be taken away by the adminis
trators of the law, except by a misuse of power that amounts to a
crime.
If the protection by the police of a man's freedom and property
can be withdrawn by the Mayor or any other officer, how does it
differ from ordering the Fire Department not to save his house
when it is burning? The public officer who says he "would be a
fool" not to use his official power against his private enemy who has
violated no law is a criminal. He is guilty of the 'gravest offense.
As long as he is in power, he and the others who keep him there
are a menace to the city and a disgrace. They put themselves and
their grudges and hates in the place of the law, when in a free coun
try the law only is supreme and every citizen is entitled to its
protection.
The theory held in the executive department of the govern
ment of this city is that when officials are elected the law ceases,
and their will takes its place. Privilege and punishment are dis
pensed by them and not by the law. If their friends and agents
violate the law their power is used to keep the violators from pun
ishment. If their enemies become troublesome they use public
power to wreak private vengeance. To the remedy of this condi
tion the people are called by a duty which they Will neglect at their
peril. All of the instruments of impeachment being in the hands
of those officers who most deserve it, the people have only one rem
edv â the ballot. . -
If the existing evils are not sufficient to urge them to act, their
indifference will be a vindication of official lawlessness, and will
make the city a stench. "Your city is getting a bad name," said an
Eastern Senator who had no partisan | reason for saying it. Let
every good citizen register, enroll himself on the side of the Repub
lican League and give up a day of his time, if need be,. for service
at the August primary. Winning there, let the time between the
nominations and the November election be devoted to an earnest
and public spirited effort to give San Francisco a good name abroad.
Pestilence cannot kill a city. It can be eradicated. Mutations of
private fortune cannot kill a city, for enterprise can offset them.
But a bad name is worse than killing a city, and the public officiary
that is responsible is worse than the private criminals who. prey
upon the community.
San Francisco is approaching a crisis. The situation is acute.
The fate of the city is in the hands of its citizens who want to live
in no mean town.
THE present hot weather in San Francisco breaks the record.
It is the hottest July weather in more than thirty years. Mr.
McAdic's fog was in the offing several mornings, like a ship
waiting for a pilot to get in through the Golden Gate. But an east
wind would blow it seaward and then the people cried "Wow" and
mopped their brows. But misery loves company and we have both.
In other parts of this country and in Europe the heat has been in
tense. In Rome the temperature rose to more than 100 degrees and
throughout Italy hundreds have been stricken by the heat. As for
the Eternal City, it has not seen a hotter time since that affair be
tween Caesar and Mr. Brutus.
In Eastern cities of the United States there is much suffering,
though the temperature runs lower than here. The heat is matte
deadly by the humidity. We have an automatic climate. When
the temperature goes up humidity goes down,' and the heat is not
so oppressive. x
We have faith that Mr. McAdie's "brisk breeze" will bring
relief. While waiting for it everybody should avoid hot; rebellious
liquors, severe exercise and heated arguments, walk on the shady
side of the street and use every means toÂ« avoid bad temper, even if
it be necessary to abstain from the telephone. â¢

COLONEL GREENE'S BEAR SCARES
HOTEL MAN, WHO SUGGESTS THAT
BRUTE BE SENT TO TOM LAWSON
COLONEL GREENR'S BAIIY BRUIN ENLIVENS THINGS AT THE IHG HOTEL.
THE Ansonia Hotel at Seventy-third street and Hroad
way is sheltering a distinguished guest from New
Mexico, says the New York World. He is a protege
of Colorfel William C. Greene, the copper king, and as
large, airy apartments on the roof of the hotel.
The new arrival is v three-months-old bear of the silver
tip variety. Colonel Greeno has been nway hunting. Qn
his arrival he cnlled W. E. D. Stokes up on the phone.
"Say, Stokes, I've got a present for you," he said. "Went
out bear hunting in New Mexico and killed ashe-^bear with
two cubs. I gave one of the orphans to a friend of mine
out there and shipped the other to you. , He'll make a bully
pet for you at the Ansonla.".
"Pet. eh!" came back over the wire, ."and do you think
I'm going to turn this hotel into a Zoo? If you dare to
tend that bear up here I'll sue you for malfeasance In of
fice. No, sir, you just give that bear to some, other enemy.
Don't bring him near me or there'll be some shooting. I
might miss him in the excitement and hit you."
OUR JOYS AND SORROWS
Dorothy Fenimore
( Â£ A LAS tor h . im who never soes
LjL The star's shine through hl3
cypress trees'.
Who hopeless lays his dead away.
Nor looks to see the breaking: day
Across the mournful marbles play!.
Who hath not learned in hours of faith
The truth to flesh and sense unknown,
That Life is ever lord of death,
And Love can never lose his own?"
Sorrow is one of love's most precious
gifts. It is most deeply personal; it
belongs to whom it comes, and to no
other. It means the making of him,
or the marring; it is the touchstone
which tests .his charact,ex VH>;
The grief that is ours belongs to us
alone. Our joys we are disposed to of-,
fer to the world with generous hand.
We throw our casement open wide that
all who are outside may share the radl^
ance which illumines Our spirit's little
room.
But when sorrow comes to us we pull
the shutters of our windows close and
draw our curtains down that we may
sit in quiet for a little while with him
who is most dear, pale Sorrow, whose
deep, sad eyes are sweet with the
exaltation of. a love that cannot die.
When he would go at last and leave us,
still we clasp his robe and murmur.
"Stay yet a little. I cannot let you
go.' Your voice is all melodious with
tender memory. You are love's mes
senger; you bring me higher hopes, and
dreams of happiness renewed."
The mood of lofty exaltation that
comes to the mind when it has gath
ered itself together after grief's first
shock of terrible surprise makes? one
appreciate that there is quite as much
pieasure in pain as there is pain -in
pleasure. Tho two experiences affect
the nervous 6rganism similarly, in the
same way that extreme of heat and
extreme of cold give to startled nerves
an identical sensation.
Physically and ..mentally, poignant
suffering resembles ecstatic delight In
that both are an emotion which has no
past, no future, which is all keen sen
sation In the present. \
â¢ The Inspiration of a man's life is
often born of his sorrows. " : Artist,
musician or writer must find his own
soul before he can succeed in touching
the - soul of another. Said . William
Mathews in a burst of rhetoric: "As

eat off your hand â -or even your leg." _
j Long before the arrival of the bear the news of it had
spread over the Ansonla and there was great excitement.
Some of the women were in favor of moving out, but Man
ager Webb assured them that there was not the least dan
ger, as the orphan would not be permitted to use the ele
vators or dine In the restaurant. â¢
When the bear was brought in Colonel Greene hurried
up to see Mr. Stokes, only to find the doors of his apart
ments, all barricaded. *
"Now see here, Colonel, you Just take that blamed bear
and hike right out of here," said . Mr. Stokes; "send him
to your friend- Tom Lawson of . Boston, and that may save
you the trouble of going all the way up there one of these
days to annihilate him."
If anybody wants to see the orphan bear he is to be
found on tho roof of the Ansonla. Colonel Greene is the
only person In the hotel who has the courage to feed him.

IT]has been asserted that man I 3 wom
an's j superior . in mathematics and its
twin brother, logic. Assuming that the
assertion is true, how few people prob
ably have; thought that this .superiority
is 'due to the pockets which he has and
has not. It is almost painful to reflect
that the great majority of people doubt
less never have thought of this obvious
fact. It works In this way:
A man has, say, . thirteen pockets and
from his boyhood onward he has to keep
track of all of them. Think of the men
tal : discipline this involves. In' one of
these pockets he has a bunch of keys,
a knife, some old coins and a few cheap"
collar buttons; In another he has a;foun
tain > pen. a " lead pencil" or two and a
spectacle case ; ' In y et : another there are
letters and . a pocketbook. â¢ So, it goes
through the list of thirteen pockets, and
he - must be "prepared at any moment to
pull any given article * from any given
pocket. Moreover, he , must know just
how many articles are in each one of the
pockets, and must know the sum total ot
them, so that when ho removes them all,
as he â¢ occasionally must, he can merely
count them and say to himself: "There
are thirty-seven of themJ - Yes, all of. my
treasures are here; nothing has strayed."
Do you J not J see :, what fine mental exer
cise this is, and how it | necessarily keeps
the man ; right ;up in his mathematics?

HEAT RECORD
Mercury Ascends Nearly to
the Hundred Degree Mark
Few Minutes Before Noon
ICE FAMINE OCCURS
Factories Run to Full Capac
ty Day and Night, but
Cannot Fill Their Orders
yesterday was the hottest day this
year and the hottest July day in the
history of the local branch of the Weath
er Bureau. The mercury reached 9S de
crees a little before noon, but receded to
75 degrees within the next five hours. The
next hottest July day was In 1903, when
the temperature registered was 91 de
grees. On two days of last September,
during the Knights Templar conclave,
however, the weather was hotter than
yesterday.
This sort of weather is abnormal for
San Francisco. The average temperature
for July for more than fifty years Is
about 64 degrees. The unusual heat is
caused, according to Professor McAdie,
by an interruption In the circulation of
the atmosphere about the bay. Normally
the western breeze relieves the city from
the exceedingly warm weather of the "In
terior. At present the ocean winds are
shut off and San Francisco gets practi
cally the same weather as interior cities.
The heat is not so dangerous,- McAdie
says, as in Eastern towns.
During the very early hours of yes
terday morning the mercury fell to 65
degrees, but after the sun had risen
there was an unexpected rise In tempera
ture. At 3 o'clock the mercury had fallen
to SS degrees and at 4 o'clock had risen
again to 92 degrees. Professor McAdie
thinks this morning should be warm with
cooling breezes in the afternoon. He
states that there will be no immediate
change in the general situation.
The ice plants of the city have been
taxed to their utmost and although all
of the factories have been running to full
capacity, both day and night, the output
has proved insufficient to satisfy the de
mand. The situation became so acute
yesterday that early in the day the Na
tional Ice Company was obliged to cut
all orders down 75 per cent and similar
action was taken by other producers. T**As
a result of this order there was a marked
scarcity of ice and large numbers of
regular local consumers were unable to
produce supplies. The steamboat lines,
too, were sufferers In this respect and
the steamship Manchuria, which sails to
day for the Orient, will take less than
5-3 per cent of the quantity originally
ordered. :
To make matters worse for the ice men
a trainload of natural ice,' ordered two
days ago from tiie Truckee River country
in anticipation 'of a famine, was delayed
by the burning of a shed on the railroad
and the entire consignment was stalled
somewhere near Boca when last heard
of.
The fruit market was also affected and
there have been several sharp advances
in wholesale rates during the last few
day?. Prices of lemons advanced 75 per
cent at wholesale on Thursday and the
market was practically bare yesterday.
Mexican limes, which were selling at $4 50
per case on the preceding day, were in
urgent demand yesterday and nearly all
of the available supplies were cleaned up
at $6 and ?7 per case. It was also re
ported that growing fruit crops in the
districts around the bay had been dam
aped considerably by the hot sun and It

have been no serious results from the
heat.
IIEALDS^URG, July 7.â A new heat
record was established in this city to-day
when the mercury reached 134 degrees in
the sun and 110 degrees In the shade. At

111. These figures are official. Peo
ple are fast leaving 1 town for the coast

fast.
PEACHES ARE BENEFITED.
Excessive Heat Innnres the Crop In
Yuba County.
MARYSVILLE, July 7. â The warm
"weather of the last week has caused
peaches to ripen rapidly and the local
canneries are working- a large force of
men to get in readiness to handle the
large crop which will begin to arrive
â¢much sooner than expected. Many
people will soon be employed In this
city and the Sutter County canneries.
NEW RECORD FOR HEAT.
" SAICTA ROSA, July 7. â This was the

RECEIVES OFFERS FOE
.; A SCHOOLHOUSE SITE
City Attorney Notifies Super
visors of Propositions to
Sell Land to City.
City Attorney Long yesterday submitted
to the Board of Supervisors the offer of
Lyon & Hoag to sell the block of land
bounded by First avenue, Frederick. Wil
lard and Carl streets, proposed as a site
for a new polytechnic high school, for the
sum of $71,230. Long suggests that an ap
praisement of the block be made before
any attempt to proceed further in the
matter.
Long also submitted the offer of F. G.
Bianchi to convey to the city property on
Fell street near Franklin as a part of
the site of the new public library for
$16,000. and that of James Irvine to con
vey a lot at the â¢ rner of Fourteenth and
Castro streets for school purposes at
prices ranging from J25.000 to $35,200. ac
cording to the frontage selected. There
Is but $22,000 available for the purpose
and the lot selected by an ordinance is
appraised at $22,000.
Long reported that he does not deem
it advisable to proceed In the matter of
soliciting offers of the block bounded by
Sutter, Steiner, Pierce and Post streets
for a site for the Lowell High School, as
Golden Gate Commandery is about to
erect a large public hall on a portion of
the block and flats are being erected on
the adjoining trontage.
Long also reports that he has been un
able to secure offers from the Van Ber
gen estate, which owns tae block bounded
by Baker, Lyon, Fell and Hayes streets,
as an alternative site for the Lowell High
School, as five of the heirs of the Van
Bergen estate live in Germany and would
have to be communicated with.
WANTS CffILDBEN TO
EXJOY A VACATION
Millionaire Talbot Will Try
to Beach Agreement
With Wife.
Not until after the vacation period of
the Superior Court will the question of
the permanent custody of the children of
Millionaire William H. Talbot and his
wife, Annie, who is suing him for separ
ate maintenance, be definitely settled.
Talbot's motion to modify the injunction
heretofore issued restraining him from
interfering with his children was called
before Judge Murasky yesterday morning,
but after some discussion it was agreed
to continue the hearing until Monday.
It is understood that the continuance
was granted to enable Mr. and Mrs. Tal
bot to reach some agreement, if possible,
as to the custody of the children during
the summer months, that they may be
given a vacation in the country. Mr. Tal
bot is anxious that the youngsters should
take full advantage of the season, but
under the present conditions they are
restrained from leaving the city without
special order of court. If the question 6t
their, outing is satisfactorily arranged
before Monday, at that time the court
will make an order postponing the
hearing of the motion to modify the In
junction until later In August.
Neither Mr. nor Mrs. Talbot was in
court yesterday, their Interests being
cared for by counsel.
BRIGGS SAYS THAT PERSONAL
REASONS CAUSE CRITICISM
Resolutions Adopted In Fresno Against
State Board of Trade Report
Kxplalned by Manager. , ij^i
Resolutions have been adopted by the
Fresno Chamber of Commerce. In which
censure of the last annual report of the
California. State Board of Trade is con-"
tamed. Manager Briggs of the State
Board of Trade said yesterday he had
heard that resolutions were to be adopted
by the Fresno Chamber of Commerce
criticizing the report. Press dispatches
and publications in the i resno papers had
brought him information that "'such'criti
cism -had been made. Objection was of
fered to the form of a tabulation con
tained in the report relative to the ship
ment of dried fruits, raisins .and other
products^ through the terminal points es
tablished by the transportation lines.
The purpose in the tabulation was to give
inquirers accurate information concerning
the movement of California products,
their extent ; particularly. t
Annual statistics relative to shipments
from all points in tne State must neces
sarily be derived from the transportation
lines, for there is no other agency for
collecting this Information. The railroads
base their statistics on shipments at ter
minals. Fresno is not a terminal. It has
been mentioned, however, in every ?. an
nual report of the California State Board
of Trade for some years precisely as it is
in the report just issued. There is noth
ing new in this. .No complaint has ever
been made before, y
Probably none would have been ] made
at this time, Mr. Briggs said, but for per
sonal reasons which do not appear. "The
statistics contained .. in the annual report
for 1904 do not ! purport \u25a0 to ": show arid -do
not show anything concerning the. extent
of production in any section except as it
may, be indicated . by. the volume ; of busi
ness passing through the gateways iof
transportation.' The California â, State
Board of Trade has ' always labored \ for
Fresno County and will ' continue to do so
as much as â¢ for any county ; in . the \u25a0 State,
he says, and Â» does not : think the 'Tpoint
made will be taken ' seriously by any. one
familiar, with the work and purposes of
the Board.in| wBBSBBUuBKttBBBi

LABOR TROUBLE
IS DISCUSSED
President Higgins Writes
Letter to . Secretary of
Typothetae on Lockout
CONTRACT INTERPRETED
Printing Pressmen's; Claims
to Enforcement^ of Laws
Supported Ar the Rules
: In a communication i sent to- Secretary
John Macintyre of | the United . Typothetae
of America yesterday, X President Martin
P. Higgins of ! the International 'Printing
Pressmen's Union accusesUhe local Typo
thetae of gross violation of the 'contract
between them. -The attitude : y'. of the*
printers has been that the agreement was
arbitrarily abrogated on July 3, when '\u25a0 the
notices were posted by the employers
that- a 'nine-hour^ day would- go into
effect. " .. :. >v ':" â¢'-- vV^tV
The eight-hour day was , arrived 'at by
the gradual process of shortening the
nine-hour day fifteen , minutes every six
months for two: years. It was finally
established January l.last, so it has had
but. six months' trial. /
The Typographical- Union says the con
tract could not be quashed until- both
sides have considered it, but ithe Typo
thetae disagrees and still holds out for; a
return to the : old schedule. President
Higgins' communication says in part:
We will not permit the United Typothetae
of America to juggle .with / that contract, or,
under the pretense put forward by you, to
attempt to use it for. the oppression of the
local Printing PresHmen's Union of San Fran
cisco, i We will ;. be forced, therefore, if you
persist in supporting the present " lockout and
giving it the sanction and .' moral support of
the United Typothetae, - contrary "to equity
and honor and justice, to advise . the - Printing
Pressmen' s and Assistants' " Union , throughout
the United States and Canada that' the con
duct of the Typothetae with respect to the
national contract Is not characterized \u25a0by . good
faith, "and let the ' Pressmen's ; and Assistants'
Union determine whether or not they desire to
be bound by contract to such a national body
of employ ing printers.. . â¢ . : ..
AGREEMENT- NOT BINDING. ;
Tho national agreement will not be recog
nized as binding upon the Pressmen's Union
No. 24 of San Francisco. That question Is no
longer open to discussion.
He continues to say. that the interference
of Macintyre in the lockout , to i the dis
turbance of the ' local' industrial rela
tions may result In ! a' permanent breach
between the two organizations. "V
The International: Union forwarded the
local printers $1500 , last : night with which
they may continue the fight against the
employers and } it , Is \ the purpose of , the
union to maintain the right, according to
the previous contract, for an eight-hour
day.' I ' \u25a0 : :-. '-' \u25a0 .- . . \u25a0' \u25a0 \u25a0;. :- ; v V '
President French of the local ;â¢ Typo

statement describing' its view of. the pres
ent trouble: .: \. '\u25a0:â¢\u25a0;. "'''.. .[7: ;';
*In the effort to present the clatms of the
printing trade , unions â¢in the "spirit â¢of tem
perance,", advocated by The Call, 'we would
Impress jon , the public I the * main fact 1 that the
eight-hour workday was given to the employes
without the asking. ?>: It :. was ; offered '\u25a0 in '\u25a0 lieu
of a request for- a slight increase} of 'wages,
when business was prosperous and ". living ex

PERMANENCY PROMISED.
The main \u25a0' argument \ used . in urging | the ac
ceptance of the compromise: was that of per
manency.' We were told that we 'would avoid
any possible friction" at ; the time-^-two and
one-half Â» years ago â and 'also , introduce the
eight-hour day In a -â¢'sane and business-like
manner."- The i officers \u25a0of the , Typographical
Union repeated the statements of the employ
ers, -, and the men , accepted, though | somewhat
reluctantly. A' few weeks after the introduc
tion of the present : system , a i meeting : was
called to ' change ' conditions, . but it : was ; not a'
succesH. :- However, idesplte the fact : that ; the
majority ' of employers were \u25a0 satisfied, | pressure
of a sort : that : may be \u25a0 imagined ' provoked; the
present unfortunate disruption of relations.
Public sympathy is strongly with us. | Every
paper In the city has I supported' our conten
tions. The : nine-hour offices are ' unable Vto
transact^ business. ThÂ« '-' locked-out - men are
enthusiastic. " and are sure of the! result. The
pressmen I have â¢ violated no agreement. The
employers gave away, of their I own accord the
extra hour,'- and I now. they want it: back. Legal
advice has,. been secured, and the pressmen are
in the ' right, â¢ both ; morally; and ; legally. ; : \u25a0
A special meeting of the Typographical
Union will be called to-morrow afternoon
In the Shlels building, 32 O'Farrell street,
whan further action will be planned. The
printers 'employed , at 113 L Davis street
walked out yesterday I afternoon . in ' sym

they, themselves,' are not members of the

BRIGHT FUTURE
FOR CHAMPION
Fred Adams. Winner of the
Tennis Laurels, Comes to
Front With Bapid Strides
WORKS HARD FOR TITLE
Work of the Americans on
British Courts Eagerly
Watched by Local Cracks
The tennis cracks are enjoying a much
needed rest this week and will not engage
in tournament play either to-day or to
morrow. The main topic of discussion has
been the State championship tournament
which was completed on the Fourth.- Fred
Adams, the new champion, has come to
the front remarkably fast and bids fair
to becom* the premier racket wielder of ,
the coast. As yet he can hardly hope to ;
beat men like Bell, but If he improves
next year as much as he has In the past >
year there is no reason why he should not ,
be at the top of the heap. !
Adams hae been playing tennis only
about three years. During the last six
months he l;as devoted almost his entire
time to the game and that he has not
wasted his efforts was proven on Tues
day. Most of his attention evÂ»uently has
been given to his forehand drive, upon
which he xeUes almost entirely. He prob
ably has the best forehand drive on the
coast to-dayT but there is considerable
room for improvement in the rest of his
game.
His backhand is weak and also his net
work. He handles high volleys fairly well
but balls at his feet seem to get him.
His smashing is very uncertain, being
good at times and poor at others. He lobs
very well but seldom uses this stroke. If
Adams gives the same attention to his
other sttokes that he has to his forehand
drive and develops them as much he will
Indeed be in a class by Himself.
Adams undoubtedly had considerable
luck in the tournament just completed.
Just when Murdock looked to have a cer
tainty In his match with Adams, luck
favored the latter and enabled him to
even up the score in games. Adams' luck
ended here, however, as from this point
on it was superior playing that landed
him a winner. Again in his match with
Gardner was Adams lucky. Had Gardner
bten in good ghape and the weather been
cooler, the result would probably have
been different.
When Adams put these two cracks away
final victory was assured him. Rolfe did
the best he could but it was not good
enough to win a set from Adams. The
latter, aside from his luck, played some
fine tennis and showed his nerve in tight
places, He took the same chances no
matter what the score was, and win or
lose, in luck or out of it, the expression
on his face never changed. Adams has
the making cf a grand player and will
bear watching in .uture.
Although the English championship
tournaments are far removed from San
Francisco, the results are being anxiously i
awaited "here. Miss May Sutton. the little i
California girl, who last year won the
American cnampionship in a canter, won
the English championship tournament
withcut the loss of a set. To-day she
meets Miss Douglas for toe world's cham
pionship and while It Is expected she will
have the hardest match of her career, the
local tnthusSasts figure she will bring the
title back to California with her.
Miss Sutton has twice been forced to
an S-ti set, but this is not to be wondered
at as the English women have always
been considered the best players in the
wori*. Considering she has been playing
away from home and on turf courts, iiiss
tjutton has maue a remarkable record.
If she wins to-day the will be the undis
puted woman champion of the world.
The delegates to the Pacific States Law n
Tennis Association will meet Monday af
ternoon at 5 o'clock at L<r. Hardy's office.
The object is to arrange for the coast
championship tournaments which will be
played in September.
Tiie plan of charging an admission fee
to witness the tennis matches was tried
at San Rafael and vis not a great suc
cess. Whether it was w.is or the fact
thfct the final contestants were practically
unknown, the spectators on the Fourth
were less numerous than in the past. The
hotel guests were not taxed to witness
the gpmes while the general public was.
In future either there will be no charge
or everybody will pay to see the con
tests.
Tracy Crawford, chairman of the tour
nament committee, deserves great credit
for the abie way in which he conducted
the tournament. Crawford received valu
able assistance from Messrs. Rolfe and
Murdock. v
Although the tennis players have no
cause to complain of the treatment of the
hotel management, it is safe to say the
next State tournament will not be held
at San Rafael. The heat is terrific at
this time of the year and the players will
surely demand a cooler battle ground in
future.
ALAHEDAS AMI I'ACIKICS
TO .MEET IN SECOXD GAME
Scheduled Match for Championship
Will Be Played ArroÂ«Â» the
Bay.
For the second time during the pres
ent, season the Alameda and Pacific
teams will meet on the ground at Web
eter street, Alameda, in a regularly
scheduled match for the 1905 cham
pionship of the California Cricket As
sociation. The Pacific team will be
made up as follows: * ' . â¢
E. H. M. Lannowe (captain), E. H. WHkes.
A. W. TVlidlng. H. C. Casidy. W. Pethertck.
Cecil Roblnaon. H. R. Elliott. Dr. O. N. Tay
lor. D. B. Jamieson. H. N. Storrs and H.

The Alameda eleven will be picked
from the following:
Harold Ward (captain). F. J. Croll. George

During the Independence day holi
days two matches for the champion
ship were played at Santa Cruz. The
scheduled match between San Francisco
County and Santa Cruz did not come
off on July 1, .Captain H. B. Richard -
Eon finding it impossible to get eleven
members of his club together. On Sun
day, July 2, the' Alameda team played
the Santa Cruz eleven, suffering de
feat by 105 'rung. The Alameda men
might have lessened the margin by
careful fielding, but after, their total
had been passed they played loosely,
giving the home team many opportuni
ties to Bcore,
On the Fourth .the. Pacific eleven
played against the seasiders at Santa
Cruz and were beaten' by forty-nine
runs. The visitors found , the heat and
hard ground difficult to cope ' with, but
they made a good fight, Altman. who
-went In to bat last, keeping his wicket
up for twenty-five minutes. Wllkes
bowled well for the visitors, taking- 8
wickets for 29 runs. Petherick made
the good score of 42, not out. For Santa
Cruz Jenkins and Budgett batted well

GREAT HOUNDS
CARDED TO RUN
When Pocatelli and Humbbldt- hook
up to-morrow afternoon at Union Park
in their contest for. the Grand National
Coursing series a great race is looked
for. On form the rival greyhounds are
about the T>est in" this part of the coun
try and at the present .time they are In
the pink of condition, being trained to.
the hour for, the big. race: * '" ~
Pocatelli.will be on the red and Hum
bold ton the white. The bettors will be
given a royal chance to pick the winner
in this eventl .The wise ones look, for
Pocatelli to wade in and get away with
first course and possibly, the second,
but then they expect Humbbldt to out
game his fleet opponent and capture'the
ttake in the' final' spurt. --.. \u25a0''\u25a0;;"- :; ;
The coursing game: is looking up at
both Union and Ingleside parks. Hares
are as plentiful as money in a national
bank now, so the coursing men do not
have to worry any more on that score.
With the two parks running regularly
the dog owners have no. cause for com
plaint, nearly, every one of them being
able to place his entries without a great
deal of difficulty. , -;; ' ;
The IngleEide management still clings
to the idea of giving the public plenty
of coursing.' v The two-day meets that
have been going on for many weeks
now are apparently^ meeting. with the
approval of the bettors arid dog owners.
The three stakes the; card .'for. to-,

RACING MAKES
HIT IN DENVER
Present Season Eclipses All
Previous Meets Given by
the Overland Association
ELEVEN BOOKS CUT IN
Graham, the California Lad,
Makes Good by Piloting
Four Winners in One Day
FRED E. MULHOLLAND
' DENVER. July -7.â Favored by magni
ficent weather and with no cessation of
public support, the second week of. rac
ing at Overland Park was fully as suc
cessful as the preceding one. The class
of horses and riders is higher than ever
before, form has been well maintained,
and everybody is boosting the game
along. Eleven bookmakers handle on
an average of $40,000 a day, and it
would not be surprising to see thirty
days of sport at the Colorado metropo
lis next year.'
Graham, . the California apprentice,
scored a hit by piloting four winners on
Friday. June 30, three being favorites
and one a 6 to 1 chance. At first Gra
ham played in poor luck, but at pres
ent, with seven winning mounts to his
credit, bids fair to head the list before
the season Is over.
O. Chandler, another coast Jockey, has !
ridden consistently at the meeting, and
with a string of nine winning mounts
is closely pressing the veteran Johnny
Singleton for first place honors.
Ishlana. from the stable of George
Wentworth, is the star of the meeting,
her presence scaring all out of the
Brown Palace stake on Saturday last
but her stable mate. Salable, and Mon
tauk Belle. It looked such a certainty
for the entry that the books laid no
prices on the- race. The Wentworth
stable leads with eleven races to its
credit, of which number Ishlana took
four, Mocorito three and Salable two.
The latter three-year-old proved a great
surprise in a five-furlong scramble run
on Thursday, the 29th inst., in which
he met Prince Brutus, David Boland.
Flying Fox, \u25a0\u25a0 the "Oklahoma blizzard,"
and. other fast ones/ Because of his un
beaten record * Prince Brutus was in
stalled favorite, â¢ and, together with
Flyinp: Fox and Boland, set the track
afire to the stretch. -Prince Brutus
cracked first, and.it then looked as if
the Oklahoma sprinter would win, when
Chandl*Â»r on Salable came with a rush
the last fifty yards, winning easily In
1:00 Vs.. David Boland lost the place by
a nose. ' ; - /-:
" George Burger has concluded not "to
start Ctlcres," the $5000 colt, at. the
meeting, reserving him for the fall sea
son at Oakland. Burger has picked up
five purses with Cousin Carrie, Sun
Rose, I,!bb!e Candid and Toleuo. The
latter horse finished third to Ishlana and
Freesias in the Neef 1 Brothers Brewing
Company Handicap, decided on June 23.
and .while ; being, cooled out after the
race suddenly^ fell dead. Rupture of a
blood vessel was the cause. .
Charlie Irwln, the Laramie, Wyo., cat
tleman, is" now the owner of Heather
Honey. He gave the Citrus Stable $400
for the brown mare and won her out
nrsftime at tho barrier. ;â¢*- 1- ,
Arthur Harrison of Stockton, who came
here with Emshee and Sceptre, has no
cause for complaint. Both horses scored
on the same day, and soon after he dis
posed of the former to Curl & Griffin for
$400.- : ', -
The^cashler for Ed Soule. the Oakland
layer,' was caught by a phony ticket
worker on June 28 1 to the tune of $30.
There was a bet registered on the sheet
of $30 to $fio-^-Ishlana to show. The grafter
altered the serial number on . another
ticket to" correspond with the ticket on
which the bet was recorded, and when
Ishlana' won headed the line behind the
bookmaker's stand. It was cashed and
later on the genuine ticket had to be paid,
much to the disgust of Soule. It is not
new work, but every now and then some
cashier' falls. .
"Western Al" Smith will probably not
be able to win a purse with Orchan. The
brown horse has had an ailing knee for
some time and one day last week went
wrong in one of his good legs.
Will: Clark, the young Montana turf
man^ shipped his stable of harness horses
tc New; York on Thursday. His great 3
year-old trotter, Bon Voyage, may round
to, but at present doesn't care what sort
of a gait. he travels. .."\u25a0â¢
H. H. Dunlap's pacer,' Harold D, a son
of Dexter Prince, lately took a mark of
2:111-4 in a winning race and several of
fers havo been made for the handsome
chestnut. He started In the 2:30 pace on
July 3 and. with. a heat to his. credit was
distanced in the third, after making a
disastrous "Jimmy."
Apprentice R. Taylor, with the stable of
Don Cameron, ' has " displayed capability
by piloting five winners, once finishing
second and three times Don will
ship Prince Brutus east from here, his
destination being the new Providence. ; R.

A; Kansas City concern, the Florida
Club, booking at Overland, wad" handed a
cherry. ripe one on Friday last. Some one
with a grievance gave the owner of the
bank roll $200 to lay off against Arby Van,
the Christy entry in a six furlong sprint,
with - the assurance | that the horse was
"in the can," and to take all. he wanted
for" himself. The "price about Arby Van
receded from 1 to 2 to 11 to 10 and Graham
landed him an easy winner. , After all of
the other : bookmakers had reached town
and were seated at the table enjoying "a
bird and a cold one" there was still a line
behind the I Florida Club, : resembling the
crush at a circus ticket wagon!

PLAN AQUATIC SPOKTS
Members of the San Fran
cisco Club Ready for a
Big Carnival on' Sunday
At Sausalito to-morrow the San Fran
cisco Yacht Club will hold' aquatic
sports and a power-boat regatta. It was
decided at the last annual meeting of the
club that a committee of motor-boat own
ers should have the management of power
boat events held during the season. Tha
committee appointed by Commodore W.
G. Morrow consists of F. G. Wight. Dr.
V. P. Buckley and S. D. Rogers. The
xommittee has divided the Â©oats Into two
classes, the larger class including tha
Chipmunk, America, Olive, St. Francis.
Clalra and Favorita; and the smaller
class Including the Seauola, Sulu, Seal.
Olga, Regal and a Racine craft. Ths
committee has â¢ not yet determined the
length of the course and the time of
starting. A course of about four miles
will be laid out for the larger boats, and
one of about half that distance for tha
smaller craft. First and second prizes
will be given in each class if three or
more boats start. The starting line will
be near the clubhouse and time allow-
I ances will be given according to the rules
of the American Power Boat Association.
The aquatic sports wrtl be In charge of
the directors of the club. The programma
will begin at about 10:30 and will last two
hour 3. It will Include swimming races.
| high diving, spring-board diving, chasing
the duck, walking the greasy- pole, a
swimming and dressing contest, a swim
ming and mast-climbing contest, a tilting
contest and a rowing, race In the club

To-iay and to-morrow are open on tha
programme of the Corinthian Yacht Club.
On Sunday, the 16th ins t., the first handi
cap race for the Elks' cup will bo held.
It is expected that nearly the whole fleet
will enter the event, which, is exciting
much interest. .
The California Yacht Club has the an
nual race for the Wallace trophy on Its
schedule for to-morrow. The course con
sists of two legs, a beat out and a run
home.
The Corinthian fleet, made up of the
flagship Speedwell," the sloops Genesta,
Harpoon. Edna, Presto. Discovery, Vixen,
Beaver, Meteor and Truant dropped an
chor at Dillon's Point on July L The
next day a nice breeze carried the yachts
into Suisun Bay, where the wind fell
light. After some hours enough . breeze
sprang up to enable the fleet to get above
Antioch, where a fine sail was enjoyed
on smooth water up and down the river.
After spending the night at anchor off
Antioch the yachtsmen started early on
July 3 with a good tide and breeze. In
Suisun Bay a calm was encountered, but
later a . fair jj breeze brought the fleet to
Vallejo. where anchors were dropped.
Early on the morning some of the yachts
started down, but the .breezes were very
light. At about 3:30 p. m. the Speedwell
picked up a little wind and got as fai
as the Brothers, where it died out. It
was 9:30 p. m. before moorings were made
In Tiburon Cove.
The sloops Aeolus and Mischief were
under way during the holidays, the for
mer anchoring at Vallejo and the latter
being on a trip up the Sacramento River.
The schooners Lady Ada and "Martha
and the yawl lola. flagship of the Cali
fornia fleet, touched at Vallejo, the la3t
named Joining the Corinthian fleet.' The
sloop Pactolus of the California Yacht
Club was at Vallejo on the Ist inst.
SAX FRANCISCO GOLF CXXJB
TO HOLD MRS. CROCKER CUP
Golfers Think That Charles Clark's Big
Gift Should Have Been a Chal
lenge Trophy.
The golfers at the Burllngama Coun
try Club expressed the opinion gener
ally that the silver cup presented by
Charles W. Clark for the handicap
over eighteen holes, medal play, for
men. wa3 altogether too handsome
and valuable a trophy to be won in a
single morning's play and a handicap
competition. As some of the competi
tors had handicaps of thirty strokes
it was not at all unlikely that one of
the long handicap men would get away
with the trophy. The announcement
had been made that the cup would be
competed for annually during the In
dependence day holidays and that it
must be won twice by the same man
before becoming his property, but Mr.
Clark, before â¢ leaving the State, ex
pressed his desire that the trophy be
won\ outright in a single contest. 1 A
telegraphic message asking him to- re
vert to-'the first conditions was sent,
but proved of no avail.
Of the* : thirty- two players who en
tered only twenty actually played and
the great heat Induced several of
these to retire after making one round.
R. Y. Hayne of the Burlingame Coun
try Club, Frank Kales' of the Clare
mont Country Club and^S. L. Abbot Jr.
of the San Francisco Golf and Coun
try Club were the scratch players. R.
Y. Hayne is a son of the late Judge,
Hayne and Is about to enter George
town University. He learned golf from
F. J. Reilly, the resident professional
of the Burlingame Country Club. He
returned the excellent score of 40. 42.
total 82. his card showing four 3's
and three 4's. Frank Kales returned
' 85, his chard showing a 3 on the first,
a 2 on the tenth and five 4*s. R. G.
Brown's returns included six 4's. S.L.
; Abbot Jr. was late in starting out and
[ found the sand putting 1 - greens, with
[which he is unfamiliar, a, great handi
cap. Though he reached the green in
two strokes on all the 1 short holes and
in three strokes on the long ones, his
score : mounted up on the puttlng-
I green. R. B. Gring, one of Â»ne handi-
Icap men. tied Hayne with a score of 97
â¢ less-12, net 82. In order, to escape -the
heat of the afternoon it was agreed to
wait until 5:30 p. m. before playing
off the tie over eighteen holes. The re
sult; was as follows:

\u2666â¢YSONBY OUT OF BRIGHTON.
Horsemen Keenly Disappointed Because
Star la Not Entered.
NEW YORK, July .7.â Sysonby, the
great Keene three-year-old, hailed as the
champion of the year, is not. carded .to
start to-morrow in the Brighton, the
richest of all aged handicaps run In
America. His absence is a source of
ketn disappointment to the army of race
goers. Artful and Ort Wells have, been
looked on aÂ» the horses most likely to
wrest away from Sysonby his fast accu
mulating laurels. Beldame, whose glory
has bwn somewhat diminished by her re
ccnl defeat, along with Delhi, in the
Brighton mile, won by Ort Well*. Is also
named to go in the handicap 'to-morrow.
This historic event, with a guaranteed
value of $25,000, the winner to take not
less than $22,000, has been contested for
by the very best horses the American
turf has known.
As among Artful, Ort Wells and Bel
dame there is a wide divergence of opin
ion as to . the relative merits and it will
he difficult to forecast the public favorite
until the track conditions to-morrow are
known.
Ort Wells will attract a golden follow
ing. Artful, winner of last year's Fu
turity, only once failed to finish in front
of her field and that was when she was
sent to tbe races for a Futurity lesson,
the race being won. as her owner in
tended, by a stable companion. With
only 103 pounds to carry, to-morrow.
Artful , will run the fast Brighton course
In a manner to set her rivals dizzyvflJHfl
beldame, by no means out c r . the race
WISE BETTORS
CASH ON AURAY
Gerolette, the Favorite, Is
Carried Wide Into the
Stretch, Losing a Chance

and Crowds Are Afraid to
Take Chance With Book
Special Dispatch to The Call.
ST. LOUIS, July 7.â Three favorites
and three second -choices won for the
wise men at Delmar racetrack to-day.
Auray, heavily played in the fourth
event, carried the favorite, Gorolette,
wide into the stretch, and won by vir
tue of good fortune. Elliott's entry
seemed a sure winner turning' for home.
Thousands of dollars were bet on Auray
in the ring.
The hand books are still taking ev
erything- that is offered, although the
attendance is very light and there is
no chance to round up a Hook. Less
than 700 persons were present to-day.
The continuance of the gambling cases
has made it certain that racing will
continue till July 24 at least. i
The racetrack people say they will
surely win their case in the : County
Court when it does come up. Then they
will race all summer. Summary:

sale of No. 1 Feed to arrive at 97% c was re- ;

. The long spell of excessively hot weather
has wrought â¢ havoc to the crops of deciduous
fruits and berries in all sections of .the State,
and, as a result there is. a scarcity of strictly
fancy fruit in the local market. Yesterday's
receipts showed a marked falling off and In
cluded much sun-scorched and overripe . stock.
Peaches were in extremely light supply and
much higher, and firmer prices ruled for
Plums. Prunes and loose Apricots. Apricots
in crates showed no Improvement, as tbÂ« trade
was running largely on bulk stock. All the
othet- tree \u25a0 fruits were firm, particularly Figs,
which were in limited supply. Price* of sev
eral descriptions may go higher to-day, as the
Puget Sound steamer U scheduled to sail, and
there will In all probability be a scarcity of
good j shipping stock. Melons and Citrus
fruits . continued active, but supplies of the
former were too heavy to admit of much im
provement ' in prices. There ' was quits ! a
boom In Citrus -fruits .and prices of fancy
Lemons and Mexican Limes advanced Â»?.arply.

MAKES PLACES
FOR FAVORITES
Board of Works Again Shows
Its Contempt for Efforts
to Restrict Expenditures
IGNORES THE 'BUDGET
Street Sweeping Inspectors
Appointed Regardless of
Appropriation Limitation
The Board of Public Works in making
appointments on the street sweeping force
has ignored the plain provisions " of ' the
municipal budget and will undoubtedly
again run afoul of the Board of Super
visors as It has done in refusing to abide
by the teaming contract awarded to A.
B. Clute, under which a saving of $16,000
to the city would be effected this fiscal
year.
The budget provided for an appropria
tion of $2400 for two inspectors in con
nection with the sweeping of streets and
the Board of Works has ignored ' the
appropriation by appointing one assistant
superintendent and four inspectors, in ad
dition to a superintendent, J. B. Cowden,
for whom $2100 per annum was allowed.
The four inspectors are J. X. . Copus,
George Boxton, John Butler and John
C. Casey and the assistant superintendent
is William Shaughnessy, who receives
$125 per month, the inspectors being paid
$* per day. A peculiar feature of the
appointments is that Shaughnessy, Copus,
Boxton, Butler and Casey are on the
eligible list of street sweepers, for which
an examination was recently held. The
street sweepers in the -employ' of the city
were given the fullest allowance of
credits and the Civil Service Commission
passed upon the physical qualifications of
the applicants without the aid of a medi
cal examiner. As a consequence, all but
three or four were retained in the city's
employ under the civil service. Copus
stands 39 on the list, Butler 37, Boxton 79,
Shaughnessy 69 and Casey 238. The firet
190 names have been certified for appoint
ment as sweepers, the five named being
"head sweepers" or inspectors.
It lis almost certain that the Super
visors' Street Committee will refuse to
approve demands in excess of the $2400
allowed for two inspectors, so it looks as
though three among the five will have
trouble in securing their pay. Â« The Su
pervisors take the ground that the sweep
ers sliould be appointed from the register
of laborers, of which there are 2000. The
claim is made that a civil service exami
nation was ordered so that the friends
of the Schmitz administration would be
retained. The appropriation of $215,000 is
made "for laborers and sweepers engaged
in the sweeping and cleaning of streets
and the rent of teams and appliances."
This provision will be invoked in holding
up the pay of inspectors in excess of the
two for which an appropriation of $2400
was made. '-. *\;;
President Maestretti of the Works
Board yesterday permitted twenty-one of
Clute's teams to haul street sweepings
away at $4 68 per team. Maestrettl said

GROWLER DISTURBS
PERFECT BLISS.
Nourishing a thirst that would crack a
brick, Mt. Richard Hughes sprawled upon
the veranda of his villa, 144 Rue de Clara.
Across the boulevard several of Captain
Spillane's gendarmes were, gradually
melting away in the heat. But ' Richard
hummed merrily in anticipation. His
faithful wife had gone around the corner
with the growler.
"Glory be," meditated Mr. Hughes.'
"Who'd be a. policeman? Look at me
with a growler and a wife to . rush it.
While them poor devils are being
alive, I sits down like a gentleman and
takes me steam." .
And Mr. Hughes began to chant, "Rush
the can, Mary Ann! Oh, Mary Ann, rush
the can."
Presently Mrs. Hughes wended her way
carefully up the avenue, bearing the filled
vessel. The men at arms of the South
ern Station looked longingly at the
creamy foam that bubbled over the rim
of the can. \u0084 ' ' ,
Hughes reached out his arms, eagerly as
the wife walked up the stairway. "Aisy
darlin,' aisy," he admonished. "For the
love of hivin don't fall and . break your
neck before I get a grip ay the can."
Mrs. Hughes made the ascent in safety
and turned over the growler to her; lord
and master. He clutched it eagerly and
an expression of complete happiness
spread over his features.
"It's a darlin' you are." he said lov
ingly. "I'll save a sup for you. Here's
your health, Mary Ann."
He raised the can to his lips. With a
splutter and a yell he dropped it.
"Glory be to God!" he shouted. "Didn't
I tell you to get a lump ay ice in it, you
murthurin' thafe 'ay the world. The
divil fly 'way with yez for a blitherin'
fool ay a woman. Sorra the day, I mar
ried yez. 'Tis little better than an
Orangeman you . are."
Hughes methodically proceeded to
blacken his wife's v eyes.. She clawed out
a section of his countenance before the
gendarmes from the Southern Station
arrived and took Richard to the bastile.
The prisoner had hardly been in the
Hall of Justice ten minutes when his
faithful wife arrived with bail money
and had him released. When they ap
peared before Judge Cabaniss yesterday
they were cooing like a couple of doves.
"Sure it was me own fault,", said Mrs.
HHjghes. "The poor man couldn't take
his beer this weather without a bit of.
ice." -:\u25a0}\u25a0> ->i' J;sc&\ \u25a0 ;. ' .' . '\u25a0/'.:
"I. forgive her," said Mr. Hughes,
magnanimously.
On the veranda 0M44-Rue.de Clara sit
a loving husband and wife. His face is
partly obliterated by finger nail scratches
and both of her eyes are closed,' but they
call each other "darling" Between them
is a can of steam and in it a big lump of
ice. V
What is home without a growler and
what's a - growler this weather without
a lump of ice in it?

Wily Agent of the Schraitz
Central Club Testifies;
Before th e ; Grand J ury '
DOES XOT KEEP BOOKS
Says Ruef Makes Good When
Is a Shortage ill
the Funds of Organization
The Grand Jury finally succeeded yes-,
terday in getting, Melville Hermann, col-.,
lector for the Schmitz, Central Club, to'
appear before it and divulge- some of the'
secrets of the mysterious club. From the,
way. Hermann started off, it appeared
that- he had^ been coached, not to say'
much. . He Was surly at first, but he must
have forgotten his instructions, as he
talked more freely. before the examination'
closed.. The. trusted employe -of Ruef
averred that Hhe Schmitz Central" was \ a
political club, similar^ to' other ones in
this city.' He maintained" it was not self
supporting, and that often Ruef was com-,
pelled -to come to its relief and make
deficiencies good.
, Hermann ; said: he was employed as a
collector, : his j salary being $100 a month.
He confessed that numerous employes of
the administration made monthly pay
ments to help maintain the club, but he
stoutly; maintained that they were made
voluntarily. , He said that during the
last administration J. Devoto was treas
urer; of the organization," which position
is now being held by E. Leffingwell. A
brother of Registrar Adams is secretary.
Who the president was he did, not know.
He said Ruef was treasurer on the execu
tive -committee. .' ",%'/,-. \u25a0':{\u25a0 . â¢
, The Grand f Jury, was unable to learn
how much was collected monthly for the
club. Hermann said he did not keep any
books or records, and that the money was
turned over to Rucf, Who had implicit
confidence in his honesty. He admitted
Ruef was the "whole" show" in the club.
No action was ..taken, but the Grand
Jury will keep the matter under its eye.
: The Grand Jury : took up the charges
madebyZ. Mozetti, a dairyman, against
Poundkeeper A. L. Younger and his as
sistant, M. Edwards, to whom, he said,
he paid a bcibe of $15 a month for the
privilege ,of allowing his cattle to graze
on uninclosed land.; ,
â¢ Mozetti told the jurymen that he paid
the money for four weeks. He said. that
when he ceased making the paymentshia
fences were torn down and his cattle
Impounded. Several [other witnesses sub
stantiated Mozetti's testimony. .The
Grand Jury will take the matter up again
at ' its next meeting, when it will hear
testimony from, the other side.
Frank Hess, ; who was struck on the
head by a brick alleged to have been
thrown by a youth named Enwright in
front of the Bulletin office, was before
the-; Grand' Jury .'and. told his story. The
case was continued, as the police have
not yet been able to find Enwright.
Validity of Deeds Questioned.
Michael Ryan has petitioned the Su
perior Court for letters of administra
tion on the estate of the late Winifred
S. McCormick, who left an estate valued
at $10,000. Ryan alleges that Mrs.
Daisy M. Ford, daughter of the de
ceased, holds several deeds alleged to
have been executed by Mrs. McCormick
shortly before her death. He says the
deeds were obtained through undue in
fluence and he asks that they be can
celed, that debts against the estate,
including a judgment for $4320 held by
William Weaver, may be. liquidated.

CHOOSING JURY
IS SLOW WORK
A start was made in the Collins bigamy
tria! yesterday. --It -wasn't a very big one.
but :he wheels will begin to move again
Monday and if Collins doesn't dump a
basketful of technical bricks into the cogs
fair progress may be made, though Col
lins, by his many questions and objec
tions, will make the selection of a jury a
tedious affair. \u0084
Judge, Lennon was urged to sit to-day,
but he said that even If it was the cus
tom of tlie courts here to work on Satur
day he didn't" propose to follow tneir ex
ample.
The court reprimanded Hiram Johnson,
who in* ire had declared that he didn't
want a second's delay in the trial of the
case, "i do not wish to be criticized for
my method of conducting this trial," he
said, when the court tOid him to, stop
orating. This was the nearest approach
to anything exciting during the proceed
ings, though there was a. full house to
enjoy anything of an unusual nature that
might develop.
FURTHER TIME DENIED.
District*. Attorney Byington made' a
strong argument against an affidavit for
a continuance that Collins,. by Attorney
OConnor, wished to file. Judge Lennon
suggested that the defense file its plea,
to be, followed by a counter -affidavit by
the prosecution. The court denied fur
ther time. : . - . ' 1-
At the afternoon session a list of names
of men to be examined as to their fitness
to serve as jurors was read. Those drawn
were Charles H. ; Rodd, .Victor A. Han
cock, Herschel "J. McCormick, Edward B.
Sway Is; Adam L.udwig, John.Lt'Burnside,
John Kenny, Solomon Schwartz, Herman
A. Ash, Francis Lr. Cook, John W. McCor
mick and John P. Carroll. They were
sworn and the examination ' was .soon
under- way... Only three of. the! men" were
'examined during the afternoon and none
ot these was accepted. *
OBJECTS TO ALIENS.
O'Connor challenged Rodd because he
was not born in the- United States .and
Collins quoted the decisions and law on
aliens. Byington regarded the objection
as a. direct attempt to block the process
of the trial. If each man who happened
tc be born without the country and was
later, naturalized should have to bring his
naturalization papers into court in order
tnat his citizenship could be proven, it
would^cause great' delay, he said.
Victor Hancock was challenged, as he
admitted -his prejudice. McClintock was
not fully examined.,
Ir> the examination of ( the jurors the
defendant's counsel put a most exhaust
ive number of questions and objections
were made frequently.. Their attitude
shows plainly that it will be several days
before a jury is selected. ,
When" Judge Lennon set Monday after
noon at 2 v o'clock as the \u25a0 time, for resum
ing, Byington suggested tnat the case go
on to-day. /
"There is no ' reason wuy this case
should be pushd forward at the rate the
prosecution' wishes," said Judge Lennon,
"and even if it has "been; the custom oj
this court to be' held on Saturuay it . la
not my. intention to' sit out that day here.
Please .'remember .that (ray, own conveni
ence is to be consulted as well as that of

ADVISED AS TO SEW TARIFF
Importations Into the Philippine* Jln*t

Invoices tn Triplicate."
Acting Customs Collector William B.
Hamilton was advised yesterday by th%
Secretary ot the Treasury as to the
regulations to be observed In the mat
ter of the revised tariff on goods im
ported into the Philippines from coun
tries other than the United States,
when the value of such* importation
exceeds $100. The tariff became oper
ative on July 2 of this year. The in
structions read:
From advice received from the Philippine
authorities, it is the understanding that thes?
invoices are to be executed in triplicateâ-xm
copy to be delivered to the shipper, one copy
mailed to the Collector of Customs* at the port
of entry in the Philippine . Islands (aju.l it is
important . that . it , reach ; the port of en.try.be
fore or as soon as the shipment arrives) and
the other to be retained by the officer before,
whom the Invoice Is executed. Under the pro
visions of section 2ti54 of the Revised Statutes
of the United States a charge of SO cents may
be made for verification of these invoices.
It is also required that the gross and
net weight should be stated and that
the merchandise should ;be # classed in
the terms of the Philippine tariff.
