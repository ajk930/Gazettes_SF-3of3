JCEW YORK, Oct. 19. â Riotous scenes this morning- at the "naturaliza
tion bureau" at George W. Morgan, State Superintendent of Elections, 11
Park row, were followed in the aftarnoon by an announcement from Gov
ernor Odell that 1000 lawsuits had been begun to purge the registration
lists of alleged fraudulent voters. Charles F. Murphy, leader of Tam
many Hall, declared that his organization would protect all citizens
arainst "these methods of Republican sandbaggers."
At Morgan's office several persons, including Samuel Prince, Assembly
man from the Sixteenth District, were forcibly ejected. There were many
minor fights on the stairs and in the "street, and eventually a half-dozen
policemen were hurried from the Oak-street Station to quell the disturb
ance.
AH the trouble was said to have arisen from interference with Morgan's
assistants in their work of examining witnesses concerning suspicious nat
uralization papers. It is a requirement of the bureau that every natural
ized citizen, concerning whose status the slightest question has been raised,
must appear for an inquiry, and Morgan has asserted that even after the
election every case of fraudulent voting will be prosecuted. Many of these
were subpenaed and nearly 300 were compelled to leave their j papers for
further inspection. This was the chief cause of indignation.
When Governor Odell made his announcement of the filing of suits he
added:
"We have positive evidence by means of our card system that . many
names were placed on the registry list by fraud. In one election precinct of
a downtown Assembly district we have discovered twenty-five cases, and
we also have discovered that a certain band of eighteen men succeeded in
registering seventy-eight times."
Charles F. Murphy retorted to this last allegation by saying: -
"Perhaps that may be In the Fifth Assembly District, where two of the
Republican leading workers are now before the courts to answer charges
of crimes against the franchise. To-morrow afternoon the Tammany Hall
committee will meet with the executive committee and take every precau
tion to offset this Republican policy of intimidation."

publican nominee, is waging an earnest
contest. He is opposed by E. T. Mc-

candidate, whose name has been placed
on the ballot by petition. The regulars,
however, are confident of their ability
to elect Atkinson over the opposition of
the Democrats and Independents.

The Republican candidates for the

Twenty-eighth District; John A. Cul
len. Twenty-ninth; Francis McNa

than C. Coghlan, Forty-first; George
A. McGowan, Forty-second; Marc An
thony. Forty-third; Mel Vogel. Forty
fourth, and Loius â¢ Strohl, Forty-fifth.
The indications are that the Republi
cans will elect thirteen of the eighteen
Assemblymen. There were eleven Re
publicans In the San Francisco As
sembly delegation of the last Legisla
ture.
The hold-over State Senators are
Frank French and Hamilton A. Bauer,
Republicans, and Harry Bunkers,
Democrat. It is quite probable that no
Democrat will be elected in San Fran
cisco to lessen Bunker's loneliness.
ASSEMBLY.
The next Legislature will elect a
United States Senator for the full term
of six years, and all the signs point
to a very large Republican majority
In the Senate and Assembly. The Re
publicans are confident that they will
gain in Sin Francisco one State Sena
tor and more than one Assemblyman.
Tne Seventeenth Senatorial District,
embracing the Twenty-eighth and
Twenty-ninth Assembly districts, is
now represented by Joseph M. Plun
kett. Democrat, who is a candidate for
reelection. The Republican candidate
is Frank A. Markey, and he is also
the nominee of the Union Labor party.
It is the Judgment of the district lead
ers that Markey will win out.
In the Nineteenth Senatorial District
there is no opposition to the re-election
of the Republican nominee. Senator
Richard J. Welch. In the Twenty
fifth Senatorial District Senator John
H. Nelson, the Republican candidate
for a second term in the State Senate,
has the right of way. Mason (Thomas,
â¢w ho was nominated by the Democratic
convention to oppose Nelson, has with
drawn from the field.
Martin Kelly is endeavoring to cre
ate opposition to George B. Keane, the
Republican â¢ nominee for the Senate in
the Twenty-third District, but indica
tions point to Keane's election by a
large majority, as he combines integ
rity with ability and Industry. In the
Twenty-first District Senator E. I.
Wolfe is sure of re-election. In the
Twenty-fourth Senatorial District
Philip J. Haskins is the Republican
candidate to serve out the unexpired
term of George H. Williams, deceased.
The district is nominally Republican,
and Mr. HaskinB* candidacy is accept
able to the party.

WHAT HEINZE HOPES FOR.
To be sure, Senator Clark Is prac
tically out of itâ and oh* the glowing
memories, the legends that are told
of those many days when he had ambi
tions to fulfill and old Marcus Daly
kept whipping the pond as fast as
he cast his bait, of how there was
carte blanche everywhere and of
how early teamsters would find their
way blocked in the morning by piles of
empty champagne bottles and of how
the bartender estimated the cost of a
round of drinks by just running his
eye over the crowd and- how no ques
tions were ever asked. But that's a
story that has been told.. Senator
Clark's ambition' is realized. He is a
Senator all /.right and his t^rrri does
riot 1 expire" this year nor next' nor ; the'
year" after. ' â¢ .''*.' " ' " 4 '* "
. Senator" Clark set aside 'a matter of
fifty thousand dollars to spend in this
campaign in Montana, just to show
that he has not lost interest in poli
tics. -
Then ' there is F. Augustus Heinze,
president" of the United Copper Com
pany, who runs the "anti-trust" cam
paign. His enemies say he is not a
spender, but he has a large following,
and they won't let him play In a game
like this unless he Is at least a good
fellow. The Amalgamated, the so call
ed "trust," commonly referred to ad
the "Standard Oil," is said to have
money in' bank. So there is no appar
ent need of the crowd that works poli
tics in. Montana, to be disheartened
even though' Senator Clark this year
be only playing his ante, arid raises no
body. ''
The situation at large here may be
briefly stated: -
STATE FOR ROOSEVELT.
Money has always been easy in Mon
tana so far as anybody can remem
ber and so at election times it is ex
pected that the great business interests
fighting for supremacy shall "turn
loose.". They do. A campaign in any
of the larger towns, especially in' Hel
ena or Butte, is a sight tu see. It had
been said that the big corporations
having "come together," . either as a
financial fact (not admitted) or hav
ing a common working basis in poli
tics, there would not be much doing
this. campaign.' Considerable unhap
piness among the great army of .those
adepts who are most profited at such
times has been noted. The tenderloin
and what" Is known In San Francisco
as the "cocktail route" were especially
miserable for weeks touching the out
look. But the gloomy forecast was
In a great measure unwarranted.
TUB GOLDEN DAYS.
HELENA, .Mont., Oct. 19.â A great
deal has been made in Democratic
newspapers of the^act that the "Labor
Party" of Montana has declared for
Parker. What has 'â¢ been made of the
circumstance, I may say, is much
greater than -the circumstance itself.
At 'a distance, doubtless the statement
sounds important: Here it is of very
slight moment in the national cam
paign, though the warmth of ttie local
fight, the necessity of conserving every
vote in the fight, warns each faction
and their newspapers not to speak too
slightingly of it. But the Labor party
of Montana, it should be understood
in California and elsewhere, doe.8 not
by any means represent the labor vote
or the labor element of, this State. It
is a faction. Bitter opponents of the
party to which the faction is allied
refer to its chief spirits as the "leaders,
of the, fistful."
But the desire to see Ex-Senator
Thomas Carter back in his seat at
Washington forms a strong influence
toward Republican success In the
State. Carter is not only recognized as
of real Senatorial size, but he Is very
popular and a power In the State.
With a Republican Legislature hÂ»
would have no real, competitor.
This is the view generally accepted
of the case despite the energy and vi->
tuperation characterizing' the contest.
The interest of the campaign centers
in the local fight and of this the Sena
torahip that will result from the com
plexion of the Legislature Is of first
importance with many. It Is generally
conceded that Senator Gibson stands
no show. He was. what Is termed "an
accident," an unexpected compromise
ir. a heated contest and there are
so many other and more powerful men
seeking the toga that he is not con
sidered" to J have a chance. '
As stated, in case 'Of Democratic
success Governor Toole Would be a
candidate.- 'It Is understood that
Heinze would favor General Charles S.<
Warren, formerly Sheriff^ ot Deer
Lodge. ,
On the other hand, while the fair
trial law was secured to break Heinze's
power in the courts, while the decision
that brought it about has estranged
Heinze and the Judges and left the lat
ter off the ticket, though the decision
was in his (Heinze's) favor. Heinze is
making capital out of the great shut
down as showing how masterful and
cruel "the trust" may be wherever
necessary to secure its ends and how
the- people subject to this iron rule
should condemn it by their votes and
work Its overthrow at the polls. This
is the status of the local political field.
Now comes the Republican party in the
i State and in its platform warns j the
voter that this seeming war of the" big
corporations is all a sham. It says:
For years many of the voter* of this county
and of the State have been divided on lines
of corporation quarrels and corporation Inter
ests, and while some pretense is still being
made of keeping up these, quarrels, signs and
assurances are not wanting to create a strontr
belief 1n the public mind that the corpora
tion quarrel as now presented is a "sham,
a delusion and a snare." and that the prime
purpose now is to deliver the State government
over to the keeping and control oÂ£ the com
bined corporate interests, heretofore arrayed
against each other in deadly hostility through
the medium of the Democratic party. To thoa*
who may doubt this inference we. call atten
tion to the significant fact that th* Am
algamatlsts. the ("larks and the United Copper
Company are now united in a common, sup
: port of the same ticket. madÂ« up of the
friends and followers of each of these fac
tions. In other words these heretofore con
flicting elements now appear to be lying in
the same political bed In so far as thÂ« Demo
cratic State ticket and platform are concerned,
'.%?& THE SEXATORSIUP. .
Of course Judge Clancy declined. He
declares that this lieutenant of Heinzeâ
whose action he characterizes as an
Insult to him (the Judge)â is not even
a naturalized citizen. Even were he a
citizen, the Judge declares, he would
not have gone. "Wouldn't that* skin
you?" says the Judge in speaking of It.
And again: "I would like to have some
one hold me while I laugh." This is
to show the Judge's temper in the mat
ter.
With a proviso that the mines be
started at once upon its Issue, and
another proviso or declaration that he
would not advise the Legislature as to
any action it should take nor guaran
tee any action that it might take, the
Governor â these conditions being ac
cepted by the amalgamated â called
the Legislature together. % viv^
What Is known aa the fair-trial law
was passed. It .gives litigants the
right to challenge, so to speak, as
many as five judges for the trial of a
cause â five on each side. Silver Bow
'County has - three Judges; no other
county has so many. The effect id ap
parent. Besides releasing any litigant
from the necessity of having a case
tried in Silver Bow or ' any other
county, -the time consumed in the
process of challenge -or appeal makes
it possible to postpone the trial of
any case indefinitely.
But the mines 'have been running
right along ever since, and Heinze
himself la said to have benefited in
other cases by the workings of this
"fair trial" law. some of which work
ings are said to be very curious. The
effects of the judgments of the courts
upon the Judges themselves are also
most interesting to consider! It was
Judge Clancy who delivered the judg
ment that resulted in closing the"
mines and throwing several thou
sand men. out of work. Having
done this, he adjourned court and
was about x to take .. a run into
the hi!la on a rabbit hunt or some
thing of the, kind, but some hundreds
of miners assembled at the railway
station and induced him to postpone
his trip. It ,will be seen . how very
interesting all this is and how cu
riously it works out. Heinze has not
renominated Judge Clancy nor Judge
Harriey.lwho has also been accredited
'Â¦Â¦ to him or his politics. Since the de
cision referred . to. Judge/ Clancy has
not .been", popular, with the workers
and, was not therefore deemed a safe
Candidate. So both these Judges are
now outspoken in their dislike of Mr.
Heinze, and in an appeal he made be
fore them-^-one after the otherâ
a ' few ago for. an order to re
strain : in - ascertain . political . contin
gency! both refused. It was deemed
very important to Heinze's cause, and
the plea was . repeated by more than
one; of the .; factions. : Once he was
called ;out of bed in ..the .matter . and
Judge .Clancy laughs ; heartJly/as- , he
tells of how one of Heinze's .lieuten
ants -sent -jword to him '.to _.- come to
his ;(thÂ« office, to: talk it
nvÂ«T> iS5*SSÂ£fed!Wtt38iftiiS3il3jBB^!MEBBfcBMH8
. But it was a time of stress. A pe
tition of . the miners, largely signed,
begged the Governor to call an extra
session â any old thing to start the
works.
THE SPECIAL SESSION.
Heinze had been for Governor Toole
in the election that seated him;
Heinze's mines were running all right,
such as were not involved in the liti
gation; personally he was quite con
tent.
It was an extreme case. The blow
ing up of the mines would serve no
end; 'it was wages the men wanted, for
their women and. children were hui
gry and cold.
The local fight is just now of in
terest, of course, for its possible effect
on the national ticket, but it is and al
ways has been of such a character as
to have attracted attention far be
yond the borders _of the State, the
greater Interest in the national cam
paign just now having served to over
shadow It. The fight between the cur
porations, as I have said, has been for
the control of the Legislature forth*?
making of laws and of the courts for
Interpreting them. This is the alle
gation of each â that it is the aim of
the other. In Silver Bow County,
where the city ,of Butte, the great
mining camp, is located, Heinze is
acknowledged to have won in this
battle and to have elected Judges who
are, or were, grateful to him for the
honor. In important litigation last
year judgments were rendered so
hurtful to the interests of the Amal
gamated that - the so-called . trust
closed down its works, ..throwing
thousands out of employment " in- the
middle of winterâ and winter in these
mountains means exactly, what it say3.
Great, distress immediately resulted.
â¢ . The Amalgamated said they were
at the mercy of Heinze's Judge^; they
(the Amalgamated) must have some
relief; if the Governor would call a
special session of the Legislature . to
pass laws that would give it them they
would fire up; otherwise, no.
THE LOCAL FIGHT.
parties and the reconciliation of their
many interests has required a lot of
hustling and generalship. Realizing
this was to be the case, Heinze at
the beginning of it purchased an au
tomobile and ha5 kept in full evidence
for some months. It will be seen by
the names of the parties that their.la
bors are directed at local issues. The
"trust" of .-which they are "anti" is
the Amalgamated Copper Company,
spoken of here quite familiarly as
Standard Oil. The charge that Heinze
had sold out to Standard Oil, made
before it began and persistently re
peated during its progress, lends its
own' interest to the campaign. Heinze
does no; spend a great deal of time
denying the charge, but keeps his fight
by organization and every other means
at his command, including two news
papers, a daily and a weekly, at Butte
â the News and the Reveille. The
Butte Inter-Mountain and Helena Rec
ord, Republican papers, and said to be
Amalgamated^ keep up a hot fight
upon him,' using the cartoon and plain
English unsparingly. The Helena In
dependent, Democratic, addresses it
self more mildly as against Heinze and
directs its assaults chiefly against the
Helena Record. The Independent is
the principal of Senator Clark's string
of papers. , They all, you see, have
newspapers to burn the other fellow.
This little Joke seemed so obvious that
I had to introduce it.

They have established periodicals and

LONDON, Oct. 19. â The newspapers
are begirrsinr to complain of the in
a.ctrura.eiesâor rather the incom
pletenessâof the Japanese reports
from the battlefield. Those portions
of the official advices that are given
out are said to be so disconnected
that they convey very little informa
tion. Although the capture of Lone
Tree Hill by the Russians was one of
the most important achievements of
the week, both on strategic grounds
and because of the enormous loss of
life involved, it has not been mentioned
In the reports from Toklo. On the
contrary. General Oku, Is represent
ed as having: repulsed every assault
upon the Japanese left and continued
his advance to the north.
No estimates of the Japanese losses
in the battle have been srfven ont. al

lific in estimates of the Russian dead
and wounded.

TOKIO, bet. 19.â The Japanese Gov
ernment to-day decided to draw the
attention of the Russian Government
to the unlawful action of Russian
troops in usuing Chinese costumes.
The notice will be served through the
American S State Department, which
will transmit it through the American
embassy at St. Petersburg.
A memorandum issued by the For
eim OfHee says that on October 4 a
body of infantry belonging to the Rus
sian Third Regiment of Sharpshooters,
wearing Chinese costumes, attacked
the Japanese forces on the Mukden
road, and that Russians similarly clad
approached the Japanaese lines and
attempted surprises. Different reports
received. It Is charged, indicate that
the Russians are purchasing enormous
quantities of Chinese costumes.
The memorandum points out that
combatants not properly uniformed
are liable to punishment as offenders
against the laws of war and that par
ticipation in fighting without uniforms
is a violation of international usage,
an unlawful act and contrary to the
meaning of article 23 . of the supple
mentary rules of the convention â¢ gov
erning the laws and customs of war
on land.
It is pointed out, further, ' that this
action of the Russian troops will prove
a source of great calamity to innocent
Chinese, who will thereby be, exposed
to danger, owing to their inability
from distances to distinguish the
Russian soldiers from real Chinese.

TOKIO, Oct. 19.â The Russian con
centration In front of the armies of
Generals Oku and Nodzu (the left and
center respectively) â¢ on Monday, re
ported by Field Marshal Oyama, cre
ated the impression here that the Rus
sians were planning to assume ihe ag
gressive and that another great bat
tle was imminent, but it Is now be
lieved that General Kuropatkin is
merely seeking to protect his right and
rear, in order to gain time to with
draw his army across the Hun River,
because It Is believed that It will be
Impossible for him either to move ag-
STessively against the Japanese or to
hold his position on the Ehakhe River;
Manchurian headquarters, telegraph
ing yesterday afternoon, says:
"The conditions in front of the main
strength of the right army show no
considerable change. The forces of the
enemy which have been .driven from
Bensihu mainly retreated toward Kac
tai The enemy's force in front
of the right army appears -to be dimin
ishing, but the activity of his small
forces continues.
"There has been no considerable
change in front of the center army. The
enemy tried several attacks on the
night of October 17, but was repulsed
ever}' time. To-day an artillery duel
Is in progress.
"The enemy In front of the left army
is occasionally, but indirectly, shelling
our positions. The enemy stopped im
mediately in front of our positions at
a distance of from 600 to 1000 meters
and is fortifying his positions. The
enemy that opposed the left detach
ment of our left army has halted at
a line embracing Mengtapao. San
chiatzu and Hangchiatai. and Is forti
fying his positions.
, A detachment of Russian cavalry re-
Lconnoitering last night in the vicinity
; of Shakhe captured two Japanese guns
with no loss to itself.
The generai^ad vises' that last j Light
passed quietly, with "the exception of
the exploits of the Russian cavalry,
and says the Russian left flank has ad
vanced slightly.
The military critics are not yet satis
fled that Oyama is ready to relinquish
the offensive, expressing the opinion
that he may still try to break through
the Russian center in order to compel
Kuropatkin to. retire to the line of the
Hun River, unless he has become con
vinced that the superiority of the Rus
sian numbers and reserves makes his
withdrawal to the line of the Taitse
River advisable. General Gelsman as
serts positively that up to yesterday
Kuropatkin had not brought anything
like all the regiments of his reserves
into action and the number of fresh
units behind which his battered troops
could re-form accounts ror Kuropat
kin's ability to resume the offensive.
One correspondent says it is persist
ently reported that three Japanese
battalions are surrounded on a hill by
General Kennenkampff and that they
are momentarily expected to surren
der.
Another correspondent reports that
during the advance of. the left early
last week forty Japanese with five of
ficers were surrounded In a Chinese
village, but only five of them surren
dered, the remainder committed sui
cide. :
General Sakharoff telegraphed at
midday to-day that the Japanese were
concentrating at Ldnshlnpu, west of
the railroad.
ST. PETERSBURG. Oct. . 19.â The
Emperor has received from General
Kuropatkin, under date of October IS,
the following dispatch:
"During the night the Japanese at
tacked our advanced positions at Lone
Tree Hill, but they were repulsed. No
reports have been received of any
other engagements. Everything was
quiet at all our positions up to 10
o'clock this morning.- Rain fell all
night and the road3 have been greatly
damaged."
It is now recalled, as significant of
the deep personal friendship of the
two Emperors, that when Emperor
William was about to undergo an
operation last year, he commended his
eldest son to . the hands of ; Emperor
Nicholas. This fact was mentioned at
the time in the Official Messenger, but
did not attract as much attention as it
la now receiviris.
It is already known that practically
all of three corps In the Vllna Govern
ment will be included in General Grip
penberg's army, but as these troops
are included in what is known as Rus
sia's third line of defense, the fact has
not attracted much attention. It now
develops that the Ri3e Brigade at
Plotsk. In the Government of Tschen
stoehova, directly on the frontier. Is
moblizing.
In the best-informed diplomatic cir
cles ij is believed that nothing in the
shape of a treaty between Russia and
Germany has been committed to writ
ing, but that there is simply a mutual
personal understanding between the
twer sovereigns covering this point, and,
some believe, going muph further. So
far as the present war is concerned,
there is no evidence that the supposed
agreement covers active aid, as such
an agreement' would render operative
the Anglo- Japanese " alliance. It is
thought, however, In diplomatic quar
ters, that there Is something In the na
ture of a pledge cm the part of the Em
peror of Germany to protect Russia's
western frontier.
The enforced cessation of operations
by the bad weather, if the Japanese
offensive had really exhausted Itself,
rives both armies time to breathe and
pull themselves together and would
seem to insure, as much benefit to one
eide as to the other, for practical pur
poses. When operations recommence
they will assume an entirely new
r.haÂ£. with new dispositions and ob
jectives. Practically, last week's bat
tle has ended, and it goes into history
as a Russian defeat. When operations
are resumed a new battle will begin.
The reappearance of Viceroy Alexieff
at Mukden to-day for a conference Is
not particularly reassuring, as such
conferences in the past have not been
fruitful of success.
The movement of troops on the-Rus
sian western frontier and the prepara
tions to further reduce garrisons In this
region revive talk of a complete un
derstanding with Germany, under
which the frontier will -be protected so
as to permit of the dispatch to Man
churia of troops stationed in Poland.
There are about 600,000. soldiers in Po
land, comprising some of the best
troops in the empire.
RCSSO-GER3IAX ENTEXTE.
Many critics here continue to believe
that General Kuropatkin intends to
return to the line of the Hun River.
ALEXIEFF. WILL XOT DOWJf.
But there is no light upon the move
ments of the Japanese. There is, in
deed, an utter lack of late news from
Tckio, and an enemy so resourceful
may really be preparing a surprise
movement Instead of a retreat, reliev
ing the pressure on the front, with a
view to accomplishing something â¢ on
the flank.
Two dispatches from" Mukden last
night mentioned reports that the Jap
anese were already preparing to re
tire, and the War Office admits that
Kuropatkin's left has again moved
slightly forward.
ST. PETERSBURG. Oct. 20. 2:25 a.
m. â For the moment heavy rains and
impassable roads have compelled a sus
pension of operations In Manchuria-
There was practically no fighting yes
terday and none whatever last night.
There Is evidence of a new disposi
tion of the forces on both sides. Gen
eral Kuropatkin is extending his right,
whether with a view to a turning
movement for the safety of Lone Tree
Hill, the importance of which point is
fully realized by the Japanese, who
have attempted to retake It in two
night attacks, or to meet and thwart
a Japanese turning movement from the
west, has not yet developed. The Jap
anese also appear to be shifting weight
to the westward. *
Veiled hints continue to arrive that
the Russians have recovered from the
blow inflicted last week by Field Mar
shal Oyama and that General Ku
rcpatkln is preparing to renew the
struggle as soon as the roads become
dry.

COURTS OF REVIEW.
They may net agree with these brethren,
but they ought to appreciate thefr self-sacri
fice. The laborer has learned from the cap
italist to despise order and break law. He has
learned from the churchman to pursue the
dissenter with menace and vtolenca. The re
cent tragedies tn Colorado do not follow at
a far distance the massacres 2 which In thÂ«
sixteenth century ensued upon thÂ» withdrawal
of Holland from the ecclesiastical union.
THE ItABORER'S TEACHERS.
We perceive among our clergy and laity
alike much ignorance (frankly confessed and
deplored) as to the principles which ara In.
volved In the conflicts of the industrial world.
Every Industrial dispute involves threÂ» par
ties â the employer, the- employed and the
public â and the public eventually casts the
deciding vote. Thus a serious social responsi
bility rests upon every Christian citizen, and
more especially upon the Christian minister.
\VÂ» call attention to the anaios-y between
certain offenses of the union and like offenses,
past Or present, of both. the capitalist and the
churchman. Thus the employers* blacklist cor
responds to the unions* boycott. The lockout
and the strike are of the same nature. The
question of the close,! Â«bop is like the ques
tion of the closed State. Men whose Puritan
ancestors strove to maintain a State whose
privileges should belong only to members of
the church ought to be able to understand the
struggle of their brethren and to maintain a
chop in which no man shall aexve except a
member of the union. %
Bishop Potter, chairman of the
standing committee on the relations oÂ£
capital and labor, presented a lengthy
report which touched .upon certain
evils the committee found and dis
cussed the Industrial situation at great
length.
The committee was appointed by
the general convention of 1901 to study
the purposes of labor organizations, to
investigate the causes of industrial dis
turbances and to hold themselves in
readiness to act as arbitrators should
their services be desired. The report
says that no request for action as ar
bitrators has been received, and that
the committee has not, as yet, suc
ceeded in studying In common the oc
casions of current disturbances. The
report says:
We are agreed, however, la the conrlctlon
that, the causes of the violence of the UJt
three years in Pennsylvania, tn Colorado and
In Illinois are not so much economical as
moral. The strikes commonly begin In dis
trust. The reason at the heart of It Is that
the master has as little confidence In the gtxxl
will of the men as the men have in the good
faith of the master. Where distrust and an
tagonism arc well founded there Is nothing
for It, so far as the church is concerned, ex
cept one version.
The deputies devoted a large part of
the day to the consideration of peti
tions from several dioceses to use the
revised version of the Bible in
churches. "When the house was divided
the reauest was refused by a majority
of both clerical and lay delegates in
the House of Deputies.
COMMITTEE'S REPORT.
"BOSTON, Oct. 19.â An attempt Was
made to-day by the committee on
canons of the Episcopal House of Dep
uties to arrange a compromise be
tween that body and the House of
Bishops. The Bishops had adopted an
amendment forbidding the remarriage
of divorced persons, while the .depu
ties had declined to accept so -rigid a
provision, notwithstanding the fact
a majority of them, took a stand sim
ilar to that of the House of Bishops.
The committee on canons offered a res
olution compelling divorced persons
seeking remarriage to wait one year
after the decree of the court for the
solemnization of the ceremony. By
this resolution, which referred to the
innocent person in a divorce for infi
delity only, It was hoped to secure at
least a temporary agreement between
the two forces. After some, debate
the divorce issue was made a special
order for to-morrow.
This morning broke chilly but clear.
As seen as the roads are drier a re
sumption of the battle is probable, aa
the Russians everywhere are in close
touch with the Japanese.
WITH THE RUSSIAN CENTER
ARMY. Tuesday. Oct. IS.â The fight
ing, which lulled for a time on October
15, vas resumed on October 16, when
the Russians holding positions on the
north bar.k of the Shakhe River con
tinually exchanged an artillery *re
with the Japanese. .
The hardest fLgbtingr was In the cen
ter, v.here two regiments of Russian
intartry made a desperate attack on

George A. Knight j of San Francisco,

there, would be no disposition on his
part unnecessarily to .criticise â¢ Judge
Parker, but the Democratic candidate
for : President by, his own words had
laid himself open to ..criticism by a
student of public affairs. Every speech
by . Parker seemed to be an effort on
his part to impress on the public mind
the -fact known .to every schoolboy that
this nation has three branches of the
Government â executive,, judicial and
legislative.
'.'Judge Parker's one idea of opposi
tion to the Republican party seems to
be based on his â¢ fear that one of the
branches of ithe Government will en
croach on . another branch," -.he said.
"His fear that this will come to pass
evidently has prevented him from
lucidly, "discussing the questions in
which the ' voters are \ most interested."

the case of people. versus Lee Look.
The Chinese has been tried three times
for the killing of Lee Wing in this city
four years ago.
Once the Jury disagreed, next time
h* was convicted of murder and sen
tenced to be hanged, but the case
was successfully appealed, because the
information failed to recite that the
murdered man was a human being.
He was again tried and convicted and
again appealed, this time averring er
ror on the part of the committing
mapistrate. Then the "judgment of
the lower court was affirmed and* the
defendant went to the United States
Supreme Court on a writ of error. It

Reported to Have Joined Forces in
Order to Hold Down
the Price.
FRESNO. Oct. 19. â It is reported
that the raisin packers have entered
irto a combine and bonded themselves
to hold down the price to be paid the
grower and prevent bidding against
each other. The grower will not be
offered more than 2 cents for his new
goods, according to the report.
Color is lent to this report by the
little bidding or business being done.
The disposal of the holdover crop at
advanced figures is the first concern
of the packers. It has been reasoned
that by manifesting no interest in the
new goods and talking low prices, the
growers will be again reduced to the
demoralization point and become anx
ious to sell at whatever ls offered.
Because of the damage by rain, es
timated at from 40 to 60 per cent,
the growers are holding for 3 cents,
as a conservative figure.

meeting held to-day of the Sacramento
Presbytery, composed of all the Pres

of Northern California and the entire

The Cumberland church was former

but the two religious bodies became
separated in 1810 and since that time
have remained apart. The Cumberland
church is strong In Tennessee' and

BUFFALO WILIi RETURN
TO YARD AT VALLEJO
-Will Have Her Xew Boilers Installed
at Mare. - Island Instead of in . Â¦
'" the East. ' !
VALLEJO, Oct.* 1 9/â The - Buffalp,
which is now jOiiti with "naval appreiif
tlces for the Ohio;' will "shortly' return
to the navy yard instead of going East
to have three new boilers installed.
Fitzgerald Murphy, playwright, had
the principal role In a thrilling bit
of impromptu., domestic drama enacted
last Tuesday night in the Hotel Mere
dith, 252. Turk street,! where he occu
pies apartments with his wife, who
carried the feminine lead. The other
active characters were M. E. Revis,
manager of the hotel, and two brothers
of undisclosed identity. Patrolmen J.
S. Hielt and F. C- Kracke were in at
the finale and escorted the leading man
to the City Prison, where he was book
ed for battery and disturbing the
peace.
By way of prologue it may be stated
that Mr. Murphy and his better half
have been residents of this city ever
since he came from New York to direct
the staging of his dramatic adaptation
of Wagner's "Parsifal" at an O'Farrell
street playhouse. Despite the fact that
he has constructed several stage suc
cesses his income has been inadequate
to meet his household demands 'and a
few weeks ago his wife went to work
in a concert hall. He compelled her
to leave the place, but she accepted an
engagement in a house j of similar
character and it was his protest against
her 'disregard of his desire that de
veloped the tempestuous scene of which
the. climax was his arrest He was
quarreling with the woman when Revis
and two of his boarders entered the
room and seized him. They pinned his
arms, but ere he was entirely subju
gated he swung a free foot against
Mr. Revis' nose, damaging that organ
rather seriously. Then the police did
the rest.
The case will be heard this morning
before Police Judge Mogan. Revis says
the Murphys have quarreled almost In
cessantly and the husband Invariably
seemed to be the aggressor. Murphy
declares that he considers himself en
titled to the privilege of remonstrating
against h^p wife frequenting cheap con
cert halls: and he claims also the pre
rogative of protesting against the for
cible entry of uninvited persons to his
apartments, even though one of those
persons happens to be the manager
of the house in which the apartments
are situate. Whatever the outcome of
his arrest may be he proposes to di
vorce the woman whose revolutionary
behavior primarily led to it. He mar
ried her about seven years ago, he says,
and since then has supported, as well
as his means would allow, both her and
her child by a former husband.
Mrs. Murphy declines to discuss the
case-
; Mrs. : Frances" Forsythe, who shot and
killed the Japanese proprietor of a
Kearny-street' shooting gallery, Â¦ was
arraigned before Judge Mogan on ,a
charge of felony, to "wit, murder:';
"Felony?" she exclaimed in' tone of
surprise. "I don't see how it can be
felony when I was drunk at the time."
"Your condition at the time of the
shooting cannot be taken Into consid
eration now," said /the Judge.
"Humph! That's strange," was the
rejoinder. "I Just came down town to
do some shopping and happened" â -
Further narration was prevented by
the Judge abruptly setting the case for
hearing next Thursday. The woman
stated that she was unable to engage
counsel and the court appointed Attor
ney Taafe to protect her Interests at
the preliminary examination.
William McGreeny stole five long
lightning rods from the spot on Bay
street, near Fillmore, where they had
been deposited by employes of the San
Francisco Gas and Electric Company.
He declared it was his firm conviction
that the rods belonged to nobody, but
Judge Mogan pronounced him guilty
of petty larceny and will sentence him
this morning.

Michael J. O'Rourke; a policeman
testified, swindled housewives â¢ in the
Mission district \ by 1 Informing- 'them
that if they , purchased a I jar > of his
cream for the complexion he. would
send a e female hairdresser to arrange
their coiffures and charge them not one
cent for the visitation. The cream It
self, he is alleged to have declared, was
worth more than the price he asked for
it, as all kinds of facial blemishes, not
excluding, crowsfeet, disappeared under
its application as snow melts away
beneath the, gentle influence of the
Chinook.- Several ladies who bought
cream and waited in vain for the hair
dresser ,complained of Mr. O'Rourke's
conduct, and he was caught in the act
of interviewing a credulous matron by
the 'sleuth that was dispatched from
the Seventeenth-street* police station
to gather him in. Judge Cabanlss has
continued the hearing until to-morrow.

â¢ â¢ Joseph Royder has been convicted of
carrying a deadly weapon and must
answer an. additional charge of threat
ening to kill Arthur Harrison, superin
tendent of the Sutro Baths, from whose
service he was dismissed last Saturday.
The following day he called on Mr..
Harrison and, displaying a . revolver,
requested that gentleman to equip him
self, with a similar. weapon and engage
in a duel to the death. Instead offac
cepting the invitation, Mr." Harrison
gave him Into custody.: V ?/-:
"Did you really. mean to. engage in a
pistol duel?" Judge Mogan asked 'the
defendant."

LOS ANGELES. Oct. 19.â Is J. O.
Simons, the banker of Los Angeles
Camp No. 402. Woodmen of the World,
lost in the wilds of the San Bernardino
Mountains? Is he demented and stray
ing among strangers, or has he flown
from Los Angeles to escape the deficit
of almost $1000 that is said to have been
discovered in the accounts of the Los
Angeles Camp? This last suggestion
appears to explain the reason for the
sudden disappearance of the well
known Woodman and dancing master,

that > It was well established that the

part >of the v - Judicial â¢ system of/ the
State, and the provision of the charter
would have to "yield to th'e general

corpus . Issued the evening , before.
Counsel were not ready to go. forward
with the argument on the petition for
release and the hearing was continued
to October 31 at 10 a. m.
Ball was fixed at $2500 cash or
$4000 bond. Public Works Commis
sioner Maestretti produced the re
quired cash and the accused saloon
keeper was given temporary freedom.
Judge Cook announced that he will
not consider any points that were
ruled upon by Judge Sloss. Attorney
Countryman will base his chief con
tention on the question as to .whether
the statute is operative that provides
penalties for violations of the primary
law. This was not given serious at
tention by Judge Sloss. Judge Cook
said that he would ask Judge Sloss to
sit with him at the hearing.
Joseph Rebstock, indicted for mis
conduct as an election officer, has not

court to da so; the theory being s that
the charge will not stick because it
was presented under duress.

The De Wolf child disappeared from
home and was gone two weeks. On
her return she told of having been
tcken away by the Bishops, who run
a peddling wagon, driving through
th<? country. They forced the child
to entertain men in a big covered
wapon. plied her with liquor and ter
rified her with threats of punishment
should she attempt to escape.
At the investigation it developed
that the Bishops have been doing this
sort of thing in a systematic way in
league with other peddlers who oper
ate in this section- They take girls
at one town and then leave them in
immoral resorts In some other place.
It is said three similar charges will be
lodged against the Bishops. They

CHARLES WTMAV. WHO HAS BEEN HELD FOR TRIAL OX AN INDICTMENT
CHARGING HIM WITH BALLOT-BOX STUFFING. AND WHO WAS BE
FORE JUEÂ»GE COOK YESTERDAT ON A WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 19.â The United
States Supreme Court to-day began the
hearing of arguments in the case of the
Western Union -Telegraph Company
against the Pennsylvania Railroad
Company, involving the right of the
telegraph company to maintain its
lines along the railroad's right of way.
The case grows out of the effort by the
railroad company to enforce the remo
val of the telegraph company's wires
and tfoles from its right of way. The
railroad company Is under temporary
Injunction not to make the removal
until the court finally disposes of the
case. The telegraph company claims
the right to maintain Its line where it
stands, on the ground that the Penn
sylvania Railroad is a postal road.
Case of Western Union Telegraph
Company Against Pennsylvania
Railroad in Federal Tribunal.
SUPREME COURT BEGINS
HEARING OF ARGUMENTS
"So long as the theater complied
with all* the municipal regulations no
official In the city could molest our
business," said one of the stockhold
ers last night. "I cannot see for the
life of me what ground there Is for
an Investigation by the Grand Jury-
Ruef never had us In his power.
When the witnesses shall have told
their stories It will be plain that
there Is nothing irregular. The men
who are so energetically In pursuit of
Abe Ruef's political scalp will find
that they have slipped a cog. The In
quiry will come to naught. In fact. It
will result to the advantage of Ruef
and the city's administration, because
it will set these ugly rumors at rest."
A number of the stockholders of
the Baldwin Theater, were served with
subpenas yesterday to come before
the Grand Jury this afternoon.
Among. them are Charles Leonhardt
Jr.. who conducts a saloon and cafe
at 1200 Market street, and W. E. Tif
fany, who manages the theater.
Grand Jurors who have been - in
quiring Into the affairs of the Schmltz
administration have been making In
dividual investigation of the reports
concerning Ruef and the Baldwin
Theater. In behalf .of the Schmltz
administration It Is alleged that ' the
chief aim of the Investigators la to do
politics. ( - â¢
At any rate. Ruef la to have a go
with the Grand Jury, or rather a ma
jority of Its membership, for there Is
serious discord among the nineteen
citizens , good and true over the politi
cal aspect of many of the Investiga
tions.
From the Ruef side comes the
statement that he paid the regular
price for his shares, merely venturing
into what looked to him to be a good
business proposition. He was ap
pointed attorney for the corporation,
and the assurance Is made that there
is nothing in his connection with the
theater that will not bear the light of
day.
It is charged, on the other hand,
that his services as attorney were
merely for subterfuge, the stock being
actually given to him.
Ruef is a stockholder In the corpor
ation which owns the theater, and ac
cording to the reports that actuate the
Grand Jury in probing the matter he
exerted' his administration Influence to
make a very satisfactory deal in the
purchase of shares.
# Those who have laid the matter be
fore Foreman Lllienfeld promise sensa
tional revelations. They allege that
Ruef will be placed in the light of
v.ielding municipal authority to profit
his pocket. The theater must comply
with regulations that boards of .the
city's administration enforce, and it is
charged against the attorney that he
used his influence with these boards to
compel the corporation to allow him an
interest In the business.
The informants against Ruef are
strenuously after his scalp. They say
that when the agitation was on as a
result of the Iroquois Theater disaster
in Chicago, to force showhouses to give
ample protection to their patrons from
fire, he took advantage of the oppor
tunity to get hold of a block of stock
in the Baldwin Theater. It was given
him. "A clerk in his office, It" is further
alleged, has attended the meetings; of
the directors as his representative'.
The Grand Jury will to-day turn Its
spotlight on Abe Ruef. In the Investi
gation of the present municipal admin
istration that has been conducted with
vigor on the part of a number of the
jurors, the attorney and political ad
viser of the Mayor has not escaped-
His connection with the Baldwin The
ater, a ten-cent showhouse that open
ed at 926 Market street about three
months ago, must now be explained.
His friends say the explanation will
clear up things at once and be a re
buke to his enemies.
There is strong probability that the
merchants will not be content wfth
efforts to remove the Election Commis
sioners. If the District Attorney should
not seek to punish them further than
by ouster, the Merchants' Association
may prefer felony accusations.
"Election Commissioner A. W. Voor
sanger is denouncing some of us mem
bers of the Grand Jury for taking steps
against "his board, but the fact re
mains." said Foreman Lilienfleid yes
terday,' "that according to the evi
dence adduced before us three mem
bers of the , board of election officers
In the Eightieth or Almshouse pre
cinct were political henchmen in. the
employ of the Public Works Depart
ment of the city, and that not one of
the six officers was legally qualified for
the Eervice.'.' ,/,
against the Commissioners will be at
tempted.
District Attorney Byington will not
return from the East till the end of
the week, but his assistants, Robert
Ferral, Porter Ashe and R. V. Whit-
Ing, are unanimous that any request
from the Grand Jury, whether sup
ported by twelve members, as Is re
quired for formal action, or by only a
majority of the body, ought to be com
plied with if^it conveys Information
that a crime has been committed.
The public affairs committee of the
Merchants" Association had a confer
ence with Attorneys Wright and Hos
mer yesterday concerning prosecutions
for fraud at the primary election. The
detectives are still employed gathering
evidence, with a view to making more
arrests.
NEW YORK, Oct. 19. â Israel Zans
will, the author and playwright, ac
companied by his bride, who was
Edith Ayreton, the English authoress,
arrived here to-night on the Teutonic
from Liverpool. Zangwill comes pri
marily In the Interest of the Zionist
movement. He said:
"I want to enlist the sympathy of
the leading Jews of America in the
movement. We must stem the tide of
Jewish Immigration that is^ pouring
into this country, and the Jews must
have a place In . which to locate.
America does not want anymore. It
is already saturated. A warning has
already been received that if any more
Jews come here an anti-Semitic feeling
may be aroused.
Zangwell will deliver several lectures
In this country. *
To the Secretary of War.
While definite arrangements hare not
yet been made for Secretary Taft's trip,
it Is his purpose to go to Panama on
the army transport Sumner from New
York.
The exercise of such powers as are glvea
us by th; treaty within the geographical boun
daries of the republic of Panama, may easily.
if a real sympathy for both thÂ» present and
future welfare of the people of Panama Is not
shown, create distrust of the American Gov
ernment. This would seriously Interfere with
the success of our great project in that coun
try. It is of the utmost importance that thosÂ»
who are ultimately responsible for the policy
pursued- should have at first handxas trust
worthy Information as can be obtained In re
spect to the conditions existing in Panama, aad
the attitude and real . interests of the people
of that state. After a conference with the
Secretary of State and yourself I have con
cluded . that It wlH be of great advantage It
you can visit the Isthmus of Panama in person
and hold a conference with the President and
other governmental authorities of the republic
of Panama. Tou are authorized in doing this
to take with you such persona as you desire,
familiar with the conditions i In the Isthmus,
who may aid .you. with their counsel. The
'earlier you are able to make this visit the bet
ter. The Secretary of State will Instruct the
United Stat-s Minister at Panama to render
you every assistance In his power, mnd the
Governor of the canal strip. General Davts,
will, of course, do the tame thins.
Tou will advise the President of thÂ« republlo
what the policy of this Government is to h*
and assure htm that It Is not the purpose of
the United. States to take advantage of the
rights conferred upon it by the treaty to in
terfere with the welfare and prosperity of the
state of Panama, or of. the cities of Colon and
Panama. Tou will make due report of the
result of your visit on your return. Very truly
yours. Â¦ . THEODORE ROOSEVELT.
The L'nlitd States Is about to center on the
people of the State of Panama a very great
benefit by the expenditure ci millions of dollars
in the construction of the canal. . But this fact
must not blind us to thÂ» Importance of so exer
cising the authority given us under the treaty
with Panama as to avoid creating any suspi
cion, however unfounded, of our Intentions as
to the future. We have cot the slightest In
tention of establishing an Independent colony
In the middle of the State of Panama, or of
exercising any greater governmental functions
than are necessary to enable us conveniently and
safely to construct, maintain and operate th*
canal under the rights given us by the treaty.
Least cf all do we desire to Interfere with the
buaines* and prosperity of thÂ« people of Pana
ma. However far a Just construction of the
treaty might enable us to go.' did the exigen
cies of the case require it. in asserting the
equivalent of sovereignty over the canal strip.
It Is our full intention that the rights which
we exercise xhall be exercised with all proper
care for the honor and interests of thÂ« people
of Panama.
WHITE HOUSE. WASHINGTON*. Oct. IS.
18O4-â Sir: By executive order of May 9. 1904.
I placed under your Immediate supervision the
work of the Isthmian Canal Commission, both
In the construction or the canal and in ths ex
ercise of such governmental powers aa It
seemed necessary tcr the United States to exer
cise under the treaty with the republic of
Panama In the canal strip. There U ground
for believing; that In the execution of the rights
conferred by the treaty ttie people of Panama
have been unduly alarmed at the effect of the
establishment o: a government In the canal
strip by tli> commission. Apparently they fear
lest the effect be to create out of part of their
territory a competing and Independent com
munity. â¢ which shall Injuriously aftect their
business, reduce their revenues and diminish
their prestige as a nation.
WASHINGTON. Oct. 19.â The Presi
dent has Instructed Secretary of War
Taft to oroceed. at an early date, to
Panama to confer with the President
of the republic with a view to compos-
Ing the differences that have arisen
between the two countries.
The following letter has been sent by
the Pr&ldent to the Secretary of War.
after* a conference with the Secretary
of State and the Secretary of War with
respect to conditions In Panama:
Hearing in the habeas corpus proceedings in
stituted by Charles Wyman was postponed by
Judge Cook yesterday.
Owing to discord it is uncertain what the
Grand Jury will do this afternoon concerning
the Election Commissioners. .
tNWORTHY political motives are ascribed by
Ruef's friends to the grand jurors who are
pressing charges that he held up the new
Baldwin Theater owners for a block of stock.
On the other hand sensational developments are
promised.

children of John Sorenson, whose wife
afterwar<J married a man by the name
of Richard Sorenson. , For more than
six years Richard Sorenson treated the
two children of his wife -as his . own.
They are a boy and a girl, aged 14 and
1L A few weeks ago the mother died
and now the real father wants his chil
dren back again.
As soon as the wife died, Richard
Sorenson, the stepfather, went before
Judge Coffey, in \ San Francisco, and
secured an order appointing him legal
guardian of the children. /This morn
ing John Sorenson sued out a writ of
habeas corpus. here, claiming that -the
children were being illegally withheld
from him. Judge Hall denied the, writ,
as at the time of the appointment ,of
the stepfather as guardian the real
father had his day in court. The mat
ter, however, will now be taken back
to Judge Coffey, - with a petition to
reconsider and give the real father an
opportunity to interpose his claim.

Mrs. C. S. Chamberlain waa chair-
The speeches were all so good I wish
Z might give you a bit from each one.
One always sits up and takes notice
when Mrs. Hume begins to talk, and
one keeps right on noticing, too. Her
subject to-day was, "Is Club Life Inim
ical to Church Work?" and though her
speech was short when she was
through one was quite convinced that
the club was a sort of front door to
the church. She said that the "clubs
that stand for high ideals are actu
ated by the same principles that un
derlie church work.** She said, too, and
"with truth,*that "the woman who gets
most out of club life and church life
Is the woman who puts most into it."
Mrs. George . Law Smith and Mrs.
Mary Wood Swift, than whom there
are no more popular club women in
California, were, of course, among
those who made bright, witty speeches.
Mrs. Smith has traveled many thou
sands of miles since she was last in
Oakland and in her own delightful
fashion touched briefly on various
things she deemed of interest to her
auditors. â¢
Mrs. B^nnell. president of the Oak
land CluD, established an innovation
to-day in the way of toastmistresses.
Each speaker was introduced by a dif
ferent member of the club and the
little' two-minute introductions added
to the brightness of the programme,
which, in its entirety, was as follows:
The post-luncheon music was given
entirely by Mrs. Mabel Gray Lach
mond, who to a happy degree is doubly
talented, singing as well as she plays,
which is saying much for her perform
ance. She is a graduate of the con
servatories at Leipsic and Berlin and
has studied elsewhere with famous
teachers, and her work betrays a schol
arly interpretation.
During the luncheon Miss Isabel Seal,
a musicianly young violinist, contrib
uted several delightful numbers, her
accompanist being Miss Estelle Drura
mond, one of Oakland's most promising
young pianists.
OAKLAND. Oct. 19.â The Oakland
Club certainly outdid itself to-day and
the annual breakfast will be recorded
in the club minutes as the most bril
liant episode In its existence.* Never
has Maple Hall presented a more at
tractive appearance and few pro
srammes have been akin, in general
interest and cleverness, to that partici
pated in by the distinguished guests
of the Oakland Club to-day. Some of
the cleverest women in clubdom were
among the speakers, the music was ex
cellent, and while enjoying this "feast
cf reason and flow of s>oul" the eye was
pleased with a vista of elegant gowns,
and the inner woman was satisfied
with a menu well worth discussing.
What more could one desire?
The tables we're arranged in the form
of. a star, the round table at which
v ere the guests of honor being in the
ceaier and from it six long tables radi
ated. Asparagus fern wound itÂ« grace
ful length down the center of each
table entwining vases of pink roses and
brass candelabra. A huge bunch of
plr.k roses, nestling in billows of rose
hued silk aud maidenhair, adorned the
round table. The tiny stage was a
restful spot with its garniture of trail
ing vines and potted plants,' while
overhead yellow songsters chirped and
twittered in their swaying, gilded
cages. Daylight was excluded and the
i>cene Illumined with electricity. The
"whole effect, while elaborate, was
graceful and delicate, and too much
cannot be eaid in praise of the ladies
in charse.
Mrs. M. L. Broadwell was chairman
of the decoration and was assisted in
her artistic work by Mrs. C. S. Cham
berlain. Mrs. \V. M. Beckwith. Mrs.

not a member of the club, aided very
materially in the arrangements, and
Ehe It was who sent the exquisite roses
that adorned the tables. Mrs. Kisick
was chairman of the table committee.

Kennedy was arrested last evening
by Policeman E. A. Willing In the vi
cinity of the Henkenius place. Under
pressure he confessed that he was the
house- working thief who has been
busy here for six weeks.
Kennedy gives his age* as 22 years,
and says that he is from' Kansas City.
He affirms that he. has not been en
gaged long in the illegal calling of rob
bing houses. Kennedy was taken .to
San Francisco this afternoon by. Chief
Conrad, . and, considerable. . of the prop
erty 'stolen '.by!, him was recovered from
shops .where hie had placed it* in pawi^.
j His plan "rof robbing, houses was to
ring' the front doorbell, and if no one
responded to try other doors. If he
thought there was ho one within he
used a skeleton key. When persons
responded to the^ doorbell Kennedy
passed himself, off as an upholsterer
seeking repair . work. It is suspected
that he is the same Kennedy who shot
a- woman named Shoemaker in Kan
sas City, where he was a footpad, en
gaged with* Jesse James Jr. and others,
who escaped. ...
ALAMEDA, Oct. 19.â W. F. Kennedy
confessed to Chief of Police John Con
rad to-day that he, entered and robbed
the residence. of J. C. Henkenlus, 1210
Paru street, on the 11th of this month,
and that he la also the person who
burglarized the home of George Mur

house of Louis Newbell, 1837 San An

: Frank; Gardner's , financial career
began in this city, ' where, while a
ticket collector In the old Standard
Theater,' he ' met Carrie Swain, the
actress, and eloped â¢ with her to Aus
tralia, leaving behind him in this coun
try a wife and child, who arrived here
just as the steamer bearing Gardner
and Carrie Swain to the Antipodes was
steaming out of the harbor. In Aus
tralia Gardner obtained options on
properties which he floated in London.
He was soon recognized as one of- the
greatest promoters In the world.
His - financial ventures proved dis
astrous investments for the Britishers.
Strangely, however," he continued to
command their confidence until a short
time ago. Millions of- the people's
money had been sunk in such enter
prises as the Boulder,' Perseverance and
the Avena mines and then came the
collapse of his mining project in Fresno
County, In this State, where he bought
the Copper King mine for (15,000 and
floated it in London for over $3,000,000.
He was represented here by William
Dally, whose disastrous management
of the mine and a smelter plant at Bay
Point is recorded in the Federal courts,
where the properties were recently
forced through bankruptcy. Dally left
the city Â¦ and later turned against
Gardner, who had repudiated him to
save his own reputation In London.
Following closely on this affair, Lon
don was startled by the announcement
that he had abandoned Carrie Swain,
whom he had openly acknowledged as
his wife, and had married - Spanish
actress, with whom he went to Paris,
when the financial crash came. Carrie
Swain has since charged him with big
amy in the British courts and has in
stituted divorce proceedings against
him in this country. Meanwhile an
aged Spanish woman of Paris has sued
Gardner in London for an accounting,
alleging that he had induced her to
part with nearly $3,000,000 In American
and British securities, and hardly had
these accusations been, made ..against
him before he was sold out of the'Lon
don Stock Exchange and a suit brought
to have him . declared bankrupt. At
present the London financiers are mar
veling at the manner in which Gard
ner accumulated wealth and at the
reckless way In which he. got rid of' it.
Frank Gardner, formerly of San
Francisco, who, for a number of year.s,
was a power in the Stock Exchange of
the British metropolis, has gone to the
wall and is a bankrupt in Paris. Within
a few months his wealth has been dissi
pated, his valuable country and city
residences sold and his name dis
credited on the Stock Exchange.
Suits have been entered against him
in the British courts, where he has
been charged with bigamy, misappro
priation of various persons' funds and
where proceedings have been brought
to have him declared a bankrupt. With
the arrest of Whitaker "Wright and the
latter's tragic end, began the adver
sities of Gardner, although none of
them are chargeable to any financial
relations he may have had with Wright.
At one time Gardner, was rated on the
London Stock Exchange as a million
aire forty or fifty, times over. . . . . . .

In explanation of this movement,

obey the law as for the unions, and
that boycott banners of either em

further that Mr. Swan gracefully ac
ceded to the request of the Citizens'
Alliance.
The Citizens' Alliance has begun pro
ceedings to enjoin the Upholsterers'

at Twentieth and K streets. Here a
large crowd welcomed him with thun
dering cheers and applause. He as
cended the rostrum and delivered an
eloquent address upon the issues of
the campaign.
McKinlay was then escorted to Pyth
ian Castle, . where an immense crowd,
anxious to hear the Republican orator
speak, filled the hall. He made an ef
fective appeal to the voters for their

tages of selecting a Republican to rep
resent this district in Congress. As

sional candidate was warmly applaud
ed.
At midnight McKinlay spoke to the
employes of the street car company at
the car barn, where he made many

tical clubs of the State- At this meet
ing hundreds of working men were

gathering and in his introductory re
marks urged the election of. McKinlay.
In his address McKinlay told with
great effect of his successful tour
through the district. He said the Sec
ond District needed more help from
Congress than any other district in the
State and that if elected he 'would be
able to solicit the aid of the other Re
publican Congressmen in securing an
appropriation for river improvements.
He said a Democratic representative
from this district would not be able to
secure this aid. He was frequently in
terrupted by applause during his re
marks.

been done to the property, for which
punishment should be meted out. The
committee decided to refer the matter
to Civic Architect D. H. Burnham of
the Adornment Association to submit
a plan to beautify the property de
scribed. ' Â¦ --
The report points out that while there
are 1500 prisoners at San Quentin there
are only 600 cells in which to keep
them and the recommendation is made
that new buildings for the housing of
the convicts be constructed at that
place.
The report states that in the judg
ment of the directors the sum of $25,
000 appropriated by the last Legisla
ture will not construct such a build
ing at Folsorn for the housing of the
criminal insane as the board desires.
Nevertheless the building will be con
structed.
The report states that owing to the
advance and Increase in wages
throughout the United States difficulty
is experienced in securing desirable and
trustworthy men to fill the position of
guards at the prisons. It Is pointed
out that the best men cannot be se
cured to fill these positions at the sal
aryâ $50 a month, with board and lodg
ing. The board recommends that the
6alary be increased to an amount
which will insure the securing of the
cervices of dependable men.
Attention is called to the fact that
the congregate system, in which the
prisoners are all kept together, is in
vogue. This is not In the interest of
prison discipline or the reformation
of those men sent to make reparation
for infractions of the law.
SACRAMENTO, Oct. 19 â The State
Board of. Prison Directors to-day filed
its biennial report with the Governor.
The report submits no figures, although
voluminous and comprehensive.
The recommendation Is made that
the Legislature make sufficient appro
priation for the support of San Quen
tin Prison without regard to the re
ceipts from the sale of grain __ bags.
Heretofore it has been the policy of
the Legislature to appropriate a certain
amount, which, with the moneys re
ceived from selling bags, carries the
institution. Reference is made to the
shortage of the grain crops this year,
with its consequent dearth of demand
for bags, as indicating to what straits
a public institution may be put when
a part of Its support is dependent upon
the sale of a given commodity. The
recommendation is also made that the
law fixing the limits as to the number
of bags to be sold in a year be amend
ed.
CHIHUAHUA, Mex., Oct. 19.â Davis
Richardson, president of the Labufa
Mining and Milling Company of Labu
fa, Mexico, has arrived here and re
ports that a marauding band of YaquI
Indians has killed five Americans near
Labufa within the past three weeks.
One of the men killed by x them was J.
R. Martin, superintendent of the Bar
ranca Coal Company. Richardson says
the hostile Indians have the people of
that section terrorized.
HERMOSILLO, Mexico, Oct. 19.â The
military authorities have advices from
llayon appealing for help and stating
that two parties of Mexicans en route
to a fiesta at that place were attacked
and murdered- by Yaquis, who are
known to have killed eight already,
while several others are missing. 'â¢Â¦
One party, made up of Jose and Ra
mon Contrera and Manuel Robles, left
Carbo to attend the Rayon fiesta. Rela
tives in the latter city were expecting
them and when they failed to arrive
and' reports of Yaqui depredations be
gan to come in Manuel Antunes, Mayor
of Rayon, organized a searching party
of fifty, who. after three days, found
the bodies of the three men not far
from the roadside- Their hands and
feet had been cut off, the bodies were
stripped and every thing of value had
been carried away. On several occa
sions the searching party caught the
trail of the Indians, but was not strong
enough to proceed against them.
Luis Penaloza and a party of four
were murdered in a similar manner
while en route from v La Colorado to
Torres and reports from that section
indicate that the Indians are commit
ting other depredations. The bodies
of Penaloza and. his companions were
discovered by Gordon Seymour, an
American of La Colorado, who went
over the road alone, but was unmolest
ed by the Indians. He gave the alarm
at La Colorado, where the authorities
appealed to Hermosillo, asking that a
detachment of the newly organized
force of Rurales bjs sent against the
Indians. t
Special Dispatch to The Call.
The road was built many years ago
by Eastern capital and was bought by
the Southern Pacific, which never real
ized much from the purchase until the
discovery of Tonopah, Goldfleld and
their neighboring mineral zones.
It is also unofficially stated that the
Tonopah road, ninety miles in length,
connecting with the Carson and Colo
rado at Sodaville, and running into
Tonopah, will be changed at^once from
a narrow to a standard gauge line.
Several days ago the Tonopah Railway
Company ordered 30,000 ties, which, it
is believed, are to be used in relaying
the line.
RENO. Nev., Oct. 19.â From sources,
the reliability of which cannot be ques
tioned, if has been learned that the
Carson and Colorado Railway, extend
ing 300 miles' from Moundhouse, Nev.,
to Keeler, Cal., and owned by the
Southern Pacific, is to. be converted
into a standard gauge, with first-class
passenger and freight rolling stock.
The material has already been ordered
and active work is to begin at once.
The undertaking will involve the ex
penditure of several million dollars,' as
the line traverses the greatest mineral
belt of Nevada, the wonderful devel
opment of which makes the change im
perative.
The movement has been under con
sideration for several months and fre
quent trips of inspection have been
made over the line by the general offi
cials of the company, located at San
Francisco. When interviewed this
morning in this city, General Manager
Agler declined to discuss the matter,
saying that the development of the
country might require great changes
on the part of the company, but re
fused to eay what these changes
might be.
For several weeks the Carson and
Colorado has been absolutely swamped
with freight consigned from San Fran
cisco and Reno to Tonopah and Gold
field. The rapid development of these
camps and their enormous increase of
population within the last few months
has stimulated shipping to a degree
that the Carson and Colorado is not
equal to and the quantities of ore that
the two camps offer for shipment are
many times greater than the capacity
of the road.

THE VALUE OF CHARCOAL:
Few People Knew How Useful It la in Pre-
serring Hetlth &nd Beauty.
Nearly everybody knows that char-
coal is the safest and most efficient
disinfectant and purifier In nature, but
few realize Its value when taken into
the human system for the same cleans-
ing purpose.
Charcoal is a remedy that the more
you take of It the better; It is not a
drug at all, but simply absorbs the
gases and impurities always present
In the stomach and intestines and car-
ries them out of the system.
Charcoal sweetens the breath after
rmoking. drinking or after eating
onions and other odorous vegetables.
Charcoal effectually clears and Im-
proves the complexion, it whitens the
teeth and further acts as a natural
and eminently safe cathartic
It absorbs the injurious gases which
collect in the stomach and bowels: it
disinfects the mouth and throat from
the poison of catarrh.
All druggists sell charcoal in one
form or another, but probably the best
charcoal and the most for the money is
in Stuart's Charcoal Lozenges; they
are composed of the finest powdered
Willow charcoal, and other /harmless
antiseptics in tablet form or rather in
the form of large, pleasant tasting loz-
enges, the charcoal being mixed with
honey.
Â» The daily use of these lozenges will
toon tell in- a much improved condition
of the general health, better complex-
ion, sweeter breath and purer blood
and the beauty of it is that no possible
harm can, result from their continued
use. but. oa the contrary, great benefit.
A Buffalo physician in speaking -of
the benefits of charcoal eays: "I ad-
vise Stuart's Charcoal Lozenges to all
patients Buffering from gas in stomach
and bowels, and to clear the complex-
ion and purify the breath, mouth and
throat; I also believe the liver is great-
ly benefited by the daily use of them;
they cost but twenty-five cents a box at
drug stores, and although in some sense
a patent preparation, , yet I believe I
pet more and better charcoal In Stuart's
Charcoal Lozenges than in any of the
ordinary charcoal tablets." '

of six oranges and cut the pulp into
small pieces, discarding the fiber and
seeds. Cover with three quarts of
cold water and let stand twenty-four
hours. Then add three pounds of

LADY FINGERS.
She has been married six years and
it is an open secret that she is an ex
ceptionally happy wife and her hus
band a thoroughly contented man.
For this reason it was meet that
every woman in the little circle should
listen with close attention when she
opened her mouth and spoke on the
subject of domestic felicity:
"What do I regard as essentials on
the wife's part tb happy married life?
Well, first, I think I should say Inde-:
pendence.' No woman can hold a
man's love by groveling. ... ;
"Second, sympathy. Have sympathy,
for him In all things and let him know
that you' have his welfare at heart;
that in you he has his stanchest friend
and most faithful counselor.
"Third, common sense. Men have
no patience with a silly, giggling,
senseless woman. If you let him see
that you have brains he will soon rec
ognize that fact, and.it will make him
think of you as actually an equal, quite
worthy of his confidence. In theory
the twentieth century man has to re
gard his wife as an equal, of course;
but in his secret heart he often re
tains the feeling that she Isn't. Noth
ing, but brains on the woman's part
will bring that theory Into every-day
practice and make them comrades.
"A wife who has trained herself in
those three requirements will find that
the smaller things in married life will
shape themselves accordingly. Gain
ycur husband's admiration. Independ
ence, sympathy and brains will do it.
Then if your natures are at all con
genial, you will be happy.
"One thing," she added, with a lit
tle smile, "don't make your husband
think that he and his likes and dis
likes are of more Importance than
yours, for they are not." â Philadelphia
Bulletin.
USE OF BLACK AND WHITE
Black and white is always popular
and it is seldom that the combination
is missing in an exhibition of hand
some gowns. One of these is of black,
velvet, with a petticoat front of white
chiffon and Irish lace. The bodice is
charming, cut out a little below the
throat at the back and only a little lower
in the frontâ a charming style for the
woman who can wear It. At the back
is the Dlrectoire train from the waist,
leaving exposed the broad petticoat
front of chiffon and lace. The train is
outlined with. morning glories embroid
ered in tones of lavender; the sleeves
are finished similarly.

An. Automatic: Salt Train.
Germany possesses a miniature but

that its trains have no drivers. It Is

mines at Statsfurt. The trains con
sist of thirty trucks, each carrying half
a ton of salt. The engines are electric,
; of 24-horsepower each. As it . ap
', proaches a station, of which there are
five along the line, the train* automati
cally rings a bell and the station at
tendant turns a switch to receive it.
He is able to stop it at any moment.
To start it again he stands on the lo
comotive, switches the current and
then 'descends again before the engine
has gained speed.
AGE LIMIT ON WORKMEN.
IN the course of his campaign Mr. Livernash is making an appeal
to class prejudice and pays the intelligence of his hearers a poor
compliment. He professes ike ability to have *'sane checks in
terposed by the Government" upon the rights of employers and em
ployes in respect to the imposition of an age limit for a' certain class
of skilled artisans.
: \\ nen a Congressional committee investigated the great strike
at Homestead, Pennsylvania, in 1892, one of the Democratic mem
bers on his return to the House expressed to that body his surprise
at finding that the strike was started by artisans who were receiving
a wage of from $15 to S20 a day, and who rode to their work in
their own carriages. The fact is that the class of skilled artisans in
the steel and iron business, upon whom the employers fix an age
limit of forty years, are the highest paid workmen in the world. It
is also the fact that their work is not of the kind that causes physical
exhaustion or decay. It is a matter of skilled and expert judgment,
the training of the eye to detect by its external appearance the con
dition of the metal which fits it for each process to which it is to be
* Mr. Livernash says that the age limit means that men are to be
"run to the breaking point and then sent to the scrap heap." It
means no such thing. It means that highly paid artisans, who get
more salary than a member of Congress, shall seek other avenues of
activity and for the use of the competence which they acquire, if
they have thrift, and make room for others, to enjoy the same op
portunity and get capital for the varied profitable uses to which it
may be put.
The idea of the eight-hour day is to give employment to more
men. If the labor unions are right in dictating the beginning and
the end of a day's work, who shall say that the employers are wrong
in applying exactly the same principle, in order to make room for
more men and new men in the departments that pay the highest
wages in the world ? The young men who have qualified themselves
for that work and who are denied it, while employes grown rich ride
to and from a steel or iron mill in their own carriages, will not sym
pathize with Mr. Livernash's views. But, aside from this explanatory
statement, suppose we grant Mr. Livernash's declaration that an
age limit so imposed upon that highly paid labor will cause our
children to "inherit from our generation conditions of terrible grav
ity," how is he going to correct it by an act of Congress?
There are all around us certain social conditions open to criti
cism, but they originate in the voluntary constitution of society, and
not in civil government, nor are they subject to governmental con
trol. His pretense that he can get a law of Congress that will keep
a class of highly paid artisans in employment to an indefinite age
is a pretense and no more. It would be legislation to keep out of
that class of employment others qualified to earn its large emolu
ments. It would be a limitation of their rights. It is known that
ilie age limit fixed by employers for this highly paid labor is fixed by
experience. It is put at the age at which the artisans themselves
choose to retire and use their accumulated capital for profit in other
lines of life. We do not recall any complaint from the artisans who
are affected by the limitation, while the men who stand waiting for
the places they vacate, the men who would be denied the employ
ment by Mr. Livernash's impossible law, have only satisfaction to
express.
The Government itself fixes age limits. There is a limitation
of age put by law to every branch of the public civil service. There
is also an age limit in the officiary of the army and navy, which* does
exactly what is done by the similar limit upon highly paid artisans,
by furnishing promotion clear down the line. Why does not Mr.
Livernash inveigh against these age limitations imposed by the Gov
ernment itself.
The answer is obvious. He would not get any benefit politically
by such an appeal. He represents a class and appeals to a class, in a
matter which he thinks it does not understand well enough to en
danger exposure of the motive.
Another thing is noticeable in his treatment of the subject. He
speaks always of the employers, the men of enterprise, who organize
the great wage-paying industries of the country, as the enemies of
labor and the destroyers of the human race. They are represented
as heedless of the national welfare, desirous of destroying national
growth and prosperity, monsters to be curbed while they are permit
ted to operate, and to be eliminated as soon as he can secure laws
to do it!
The fact is that these men whose destruction he contemplates
with savage pleasure nearly all came up through all the grades of
labor. He instances Andrew Carnegie as one of these offenders.
Whatever may be said of Carnegie it need not be forgotten that he
started in this country as a poor, uneducated Scotch boy, with a
widowed mother to support, and beginning in the lowliest employ
ment, by pursuit of a high ideal made his way. IJc secured wealth,
but what man in all history has given of it more liberally for the
benefit of all men? In his youth poverty denied to him schoolsand
books, and he made a vow that if fortune came to him he would
use it In putting books within reach of those like himself. So he has
given more than $100,000,000 to libraries and to learning. His pos
session of a great fortune may be criticized, but nothing should rob
him of the credit of the use to which it is put.
The limitation of fortunes, and revolutionary interference by ar
bitrary law with the social concerns of men. may make a campaign
argument that appeals to some men, but the candidate who promises
these things must know that he promises the impossible, and is in
flaming class hatred for his own purposes./
THE CONDITION OF ITALY.
GOOD ATTTHORITT.
Knickerâ I heard you are going to
move. '.\' Â¦',:.'â¢'.
Bocker â Who told you that?
Knickerâ Your landlord.
THE Italian Government stands in fear of a revolution, led by
anarchists and extremists. Attempts to tamper with the army
have been discovered, and labor strikes have been provoked for
the purpose of cloaking the far deeper designs of the reactionaries.
The Government has taken extraordinary precautions, and so far has
succeeded in holding local insurrections in check. Still, it is ap
parent that if the several centers of disorder could be put under com
mand of a leader with the boldness to risk it the disturbance would
develop into an attempt to subvert the national Government.
The Parliament, assembled in extraordinary session, has received
the programme of the Ministry. This includes the enlargement of
educational facilities and reforms in taxation. The system of tax
ation in Italy is the most varied and vicious in the world, not ex
cepting that of Turkey. Different methods prevail in the extremes of
the kingdom, but all are grossly oppressive and unequal. Among
other inexcusable inequalities it is the law in some parts of Italy to
tax a team that pulls a plow or a farm cart, while exempting a team
that draws a carriage! In like manner the property and processes of
industrial utility are burdened by high taxes, while the property and
processes of luxury and leisure are in whole or in great part exempt.
What Italy needs is a utilitarian statesman, free from the in
fluence of wealth and class, with a profound economic training, to
revise 1 taxation by sweeping away entirely the existing system and
substituting for it the methods of modern states. It is surprising
that the burdens imposed in feudal times in many cases remain un
changed. The various public exactions imposed in the.Grand Duchies
have been undisturbed,. thought the rule of the Grand Dukes ; s long
bygone. Italian statesmanship was long occupied with the unifica
tion of the kingdom, arid since ;that was. effected has been" engaged
with securing uniformity of jurisprudence, and has "been too much
diverted- to ill-starred military adventures in Ethiopia. Now the time
has come to exercise the greatest function of government, lightening
and equalizing the burden of taxation. If Italy do; this well, it may

PERSONAL.
A razor passed Into the cell of Frank
Thompson, a negro prisoner at the
City Jail, has prevented his being Iden
tified by his captors. Thompson was
arrested on the 12th of this month by
Policemen Hinrlchs and Smith on a
charge of grand larceny. At the. time
the negro had a heavy black mus
tache. When he appeared in Judge
Cabaniss" court yesterday he was mi
nus the facial adornment and the po
licemen could not identify him.
Investigation showed that Sergeant
Bidwell, In charge at the jail, had per
mitted a trusty, known as "Nigger"
Jackson, to use a razor on Tuesday
night. When trusties are loaned ra
zors they are supposed to return them
immediately after using. Jackson re
tained the instrument all Tuesday
night. It is believed by the police that
Jackson smuggled the razor Into
Thompson's cell.
Chief Wlttman scored Sergeant Bid
well for permitting what lie terms "a
lax system." The police are baffled as
to how they can convict Thompson.
Chief Wittman is in a quandary as to
how he can hold the prisoner until his
mustache grows again.
Trusty Jackson has been charged
with similar offenses before. A few
months ago he was accused of smug
gling a note from a prisoner to his
friends outside the jail. Through this
information the crook's "pals" were
able to secure and dispose of $3000
worth of stolen goods.
A suit for perpetual Injunction to
prevent boycotting was begun in the
Superior Court yesterday by, the Cres
cent Feather Company against the
United Upholsterers' Union, Local No.
28 and its officers. Bush Finnell Is at
tcrney for the complainant. The com
plaint sets forth that the company la
engaged in making mattresses, up
holstered goods, etc., at 405 Jackson
street and employs seventy-five work
men. . On October 6 a walking dele
gate, representing the union, "called
upon the manager of the company and
Informed him that six of his employes
were members of the union and the
others were not, and that the six would
be called on a strike unless the non
union men were discharged.
The manager notified the delegate
that the company declined to comply
with the demand. The union men were
ordered out, says the - complaint and
all of .them said they were anxious
to remain at work, but were afraid of
violence from members of the union.
The complaint declares that In pur
suance of a conspiracy the union
placed pickets- to Intercept and Intimi
date . the non-union employes and
threatened them with bodily harm.
The union also sent notices, to the
plaintiff's customers, asking them to
withdraw their patronage until condi
tions demanded, were re-established
and a poster was prepared, notifying
the public not to buy mattresses from
the company. The complaint declares
that damages in the sum of $1000
have been suffered and further dam
age will be irreparable unless the In
junction prayed for is granted.
Addresses of welcome will be made
by Governor Pardee and Mayor
Schmitz on behalf of the State and city,
and an able speaker is to be selected
to deliver a speech in behalf of the
commercial organizations of San Fran
cisco. The toasts of the evening will
be as follows:
"The President of the United States," Hon.
F. S. Strattcn, Collector of Customs, port of
San Franciscoj "ThÂ« â¢ President of the Repub
lic of Mexico,*' Senor Manuel de Aiparioj,

Nunez, Under Secretary of .Treasury, Mexico;
"The Arm}" â Major General MacArthur, U.'
S. A.; General Luis Torres. Commander First
Military Zone. Mexico; "The Navy," Admiral
McCalla, U. S. N. v
The officials at Washington therefore
have been eager to show the visitors
every possible courtesy during their
stay In Ran Francisco, and to that end
the local military and naval authori
ties have been requested to exert every
energy in carrying out the wishes of
President Roosevelt. Hence the Inter
est being shown by the local -Federal
officials in the plans for the entertain
ment of the guests. . .
When Vice President Corral and his
frinnds arrive here they will be for
mally received by a detachment of
United States marines at the Oakland
mole and escorted across the bay'- on
the tug Slocum. On arriving at the
ferry four companies of coast artillery
and a band will escort the party to the
3t. Francis Hotel, and during his stay
here Senor Ramon Corral will be con
stantly attended by Lieutenant Han
nigan of the Thirteenth United States
Infantry, who has been detailed by
Major General MacArthur as special
aid to Mexico's Vice President.
Yesterday the executive committee
of citizen^, in charge of the banquet to
be given at the. Palace Hotel'Saturday
evening, all but completed arrange
ments for that function, which gives
promise of being a brilliant affair.
Circumstances prevented" President
Francis and the directors of the expo
sition from giving the Mexicans the at
tention they deserved, and in some un
explained manner the plans of the
Federal Government for entertaining
the nation's guests were not properly
carried out.
When Vice President Corral of
Mexico and his party arrive here
to-morrow they will be accorded
an American welcome , that will be
typically Callfornian. ; The friendly re
lations existing between this country
and Mexico caused it to be generally
expected that Vice President Corral
and his party would be extended every
courtesy due their rank when they ar
rived at the St. Louis Exposition last
week, but unfortunately such was not
the case. . -

NEW YORK. Oct. 19. â A decided
stand against record breaking runs
over public highways has been taken
by the Automobile Club of America.
The board of directors of that organ
ization has. It is understood, indefin
itely suspended' a well known automo
billst.who established a record in
June last between Boston and New
York, negotiating 245 miles In sis
hours and fifty-five minutes.
Until reinstated he is not only
barred from the privileges of the Au
tomobile Club, but he is debarred from
track or road competition tn this
country, or in any country the nation
al automobile organization of which
has established relations with the
American club. Summary action was
taken when it became known that
plans N were being made by the same
man to attempt another record run
with a" car of much higher power.'

SEATTLE, Oct. 19.â Charlie Hall of

Oakland's only touchdown was made

In addition : to sparring four rounds
yesterday Britt punched the bag for
twenty minutes, tossed the medicine
bair and twisted the wrist machine.
His exercising was watched by a num
ber of friends and admirers, Including
Billy Delaney, Jim Kennedy and most
of the staff of -the Central Theater,
where Jimmy used . to knock out vll
llans when - he was on the boards.
4 Joe took a ten-mile spin in the morn
ing and after a rub-down it was an
nounced he weighed 137 pounds. He
claims to be in tip-top condition, and
says the question of making 133
pounds, ringside, seems to bother
everybody but himself and his train
ers, who are the parties most inter
ested.
Jimmy Britt did his first boxing at
his training quarters at Croll's Gar
dens, Alameda, yesterday, going four
slam-bang rounds with husky Frank
Rafael. He displayed all of the clever
ness for which he Is noted.. Those who
witnessed the bout agreed that Jim
my's speed is increasing and likewise
the accuracy of his blows. "When the
last round was concluded Britt showed
no â¢ evidence of weariness, thus indi
cating* that he Is already in good trim
with regard to his breathing ap
paratus.
Â¦ In the morning Britt took to the
highway alone and traveled eight miles
at a lively gait. Upon returning to
his gymnasium he divested himself of
his road togs and was soon. attired in
a bathing suit and plowing through
the bay waves near Croll's Gardens.
Jimmy has developed a liking for
swimming and those who have wit
nessed him cleave the briny with right
and left hooks feel he could give Tom
Sharkey a start and beating in a hun
dred-yard aquatic race.
: Joe Gans s^pent a quiet day at - his
training camp at Billy Shannon's
villa yesterday. It was expected he
would settle down to a strenuous llf^e
from now until the eve of the contest,
but for some reason his trainers have
concluded to let him take things easily
until about next Monday. This will
leave him only seven days in which to
make the weight, but the problem does
not seem to worry his trainers or his
manager.
The representatives of the boxers
will meet to-morrow night at Harry
Corbetfs to select a referee. Her
ford favors some Eastern man, but
Britt will not entertain such a propo
sition. . ...
Gans has the greater chest measure
ment and is also larger about the
waists. Both these will be reduced
slightly by training before he enters
the ring on the night of the fight.
Below the waist the boxers are al
most identical in their movements.
Gans *has a half-inch larger thigh,
while their calf measurements are the
same.
Contrary to. expectations the tape
measure shows Jimmy Britt and Joe
Gans to.be almost identical in build.
The most marked discrepancy Is in
the reach or spread of the arms, where
Britt has an advantage of three and
one-fourth inches over his clever,op
ponent.

Again in the fourth they were both
there with one. Truck Eagan lifted
out a two-cushloner to- the center field
fence and got away with a daring piece
of base running when he scampered to
third while Francks threw to Strelb.
retiring Lynch. Strelb winged the ball
over to Devereaux, but Bill dropped
It. A moment later Eagan tore in on
Casey's scratchy one to Schlafley,
which he just barely beat out.
Schlafley carried In the other Oak
land tally in round four. He managed
to beat a bunt, stole second and tore
straight ahead when Kruger soused a
fast one out to short center field. ' Tho
ball was not fielded as fast as it might
have been, otherwise Shoo would have
been a dead one at the pan. His dar
ing run buffaloed the Tigers and they
could not recover in time.
There was no more scoring till thÂ«
Commuters put the deciding one to tha
good In the seventh. Streib's base on
balls opened up the inning. Bill Dev
ereaux laid down a bunt, advancing
Julie. Jimmy Byrnes slapped a saucy
one to center and went to second on
the throw in. Moskiman laid down a
slow one to Thomas. While he was
being fielded out Streib ducked in with
the winning one.
After the fourth round Moskiman
had the Tigers looking foggy. None of
them could get a hit and his control
was pretty good. Ferine had a day of
close decisions, but at that he umpired
a first-class game. The score:

Never in months has such a variety
of ginger been expended by the talent
as was yesterday. The fans al3O
chimed in at odd moments and alto
gether It looked like a game for the
championship of the world. There wero
no dull moments in the battle and
every run that came In was the result
of some labor.
Dr. Moskiman pitched an elegant
game. It was through his steady work
that the Tigers were kept away from
that rubber on many occasions.
Thomas also had the Indian sign with
him for most of the game, but one of
those fatal bases on balls was dis
pensed by him in the seventh round
and that broke up the game right
there.
The fielding was fast, four swell
double plays being made during the
first four rounds of the contest. Oak
land's infield played some magnificent
baseball. Francks and Schlafley worked
together in grand form and got every
thing that happened to be clouted in
their direction.
Both teams broke In with a run in
the first round. Sheehan walked for
the Tigers and skimmed around to
third on Nordyke's single past first.
Lynch's out put him in. Francks tc/re
off a safe one for Oakland and got
around to third on a wild pitch. Duu
leavy's Infield out let Buck register
the first one for the Commuters.
The Kins of Tacoma town descend
ed upon Recreation Park yesterday and
gave\lt out that he would make it

JAMAICA SELECTIONS.
It was one of the best of Dolly Span
ker's recent conquests. In both his
last two winning races they have been
run to suit him. The pace had been
comparatively slow for the first 'mile
and Dolly Spanker had something left
to finish with. It was declared, how
ever, that he would have had a much
closer call of the other horses. Or
thodox particularly, had been ridden
sufflciently close to the rail to force
Kedfern's mount to run around them.
Hamburg Belle was installed favorite
because In her last race at Morris Park
she had defeated with great ease Min
eola and others at a mile, which, how
ever, was run in comparatively slow
time, 1:41 1-5; still she won easily with
125 pounds on her back. Lyne used
his whip vigorously on the filly, but
she had all she could do to save third
place by a few inches from Sonoma
Belle, which is far from first class. The
time for the mile and a sixteenth was
1:4C 4-5. The Southampton Handicap
was worth $1475 to the winner. Sum

CHICAGO, Oct. 19.â Mayor Johnson,
with a big pull in the weights, and at
15 to 1, beat the Canadian sprinter
Rusk in the feature race at Worth to
day, and thereby spoiled one of the
killings attempted by the Canadians.
Rusk was backed from 13 to 5 to 9 to
5. Mayor Johnson was hardly given a

races, and was allowed to drift from

ADVERTISEMENTS.
When a child I had a very severe at-
tack of Diphtheria, which came near prov-
ing fatal. Upon recovery the glands of the
neck were very much enlarged, and after
the free use of iodine, the right one was
reduced to its normal size, but the left
one continued to grow â very slowly at
first, until it was about the size of a goose
egg, which began to press on the wind-
pipe, causing difficult breathing, and be-
came very painful. An incision was made
and a large quantity of pus discharged.
The gland was removed, or as much as
could with safety be taken outr For ten
rears I wore a little piece of cloth about an
inch long in zay neck to keep the place
open.' During this time I had to have it
cut open by the doctor every time I took
cold or the opening clogged. In the Spring
or earl j Summer of 1884 1 was persuaded
by my'wife to use S. S. S., which I did,
strictly in accordance with directions. ~I
took twenty-six large bottles, and was en-
tirely cured, for I have not suffered since
that time. B. S. Raglaxd.

NEW YORK, Oct. 19.â Contradicting
that of all other witnesses who. have
told of the death of Miss Bertha pol
beer was the testimony to-day of J.
Edward Smith, a hotel detective.^ He
appeared before Robert .P. Lee, the
commissioner who. Is taking deposi
tions for the San Francisco court in
which relatives of Miss Dolbeer are
contesting her will.
Smith was a witness for the contest
ants who are trying to prove that Miss
Dolbeer committed suicide, which, they
maintain, Justifies the presumption that
she was insane' and therefore mentally
Incapable of disposing of her property-
Miss ' \V\rren, at the previous hear
ing, testified that she had emerged
from the room which she and the
young 'woman occupied just as Miss
Dolbeer was ..disappearing .from the
window in the corridor. She saw Miss
Dolbeer's feet as they were slipping
from the sill. . Detective Cornelius Sul
livan of the x West Thirtieth street po
lice station deposed that Miss Warren
had told him the samestory. _ ' ..
Smith flatly, contradicted the Sullivan
report of the interview. with Miss War
ren, at which both men were present.
j "Miss Warren told me," sc.J the ho
tel detective, "that she had been in the
room with Miss Dolbeer; that Miss
Dolbeer complained she was ill on ac
count Of the heat and went into the
corridor. Miss Warren said she saw
Miss Dolbeer open the .window herself,
step on the sill and Jump." /
Smith's statement- was assailed by
D.' Frank Lloyd of this city and E. H.
Carroll of San" Francisco, counsel for
the executors. When Smith's atten
tion was called to the testimony of
Miss Warren arid of Sullivan he per
sisted that his recollection could - not
be at fault. < ;^~/ ;
This story was seized upon by the
contestants as strengthening their the
ory of suicide, for the act of throwing
up the window sash showed, in their
opinion, that the Â» young: . woman had
intended to take her own life.' . . "-,".
The taking of further depositions was
postponed until Friday morning.

SAN RAFAEL, Oct. 19.â Coroner
Sawyer held an inquest at San Quen
tin prison to-day over the body of
Convict William Stanley, who commit
ted suicide yesterday by cutting his
throat with a case knife. Stanley was
subject to fits of temporary insanity
and always requested one of the prison
officials to lock him in the insane ward
â¢when he felt a fit coming on. Yester
day, at his own request, he was locked
up and found later with his throat cut.
The jury brought in a verdict of sui
cide, and recommended that tha
warden be more careful in allowing
prisoners in that state of mind to have
knives In their possession. Stanley
evidently stole the knife from the din
ing room. At the time set for tha
inquest to-day. Warden Tomkins "was
entertaining Directors Felton and Wil
kins and Captain Russell. He exclud
ed all outsiders from the lnquesfi
which was held inside the prison walls.

EUGENE, Ore., Oct. 19.â Swimming
through the huge breakers at the
mouth of the Slsulaw River, the crew
of the schooner Alice Klmball escaped
the fate of the vessel which Is fast be-
Ing pounded to pieces by theÂ® heavy
surf. The schooner, bound from San
Francisco to Florence,- Ore., went
ashore Sunday evening. The news has
been delayed by broken wires. .The*
captain and owner, George Martin, and
his wife were rescued with difficulty.
The vessel arrived off the mouth of
the river Saturday and anchored at a
buoy, waiting for a tug. That night a
storm came up, two anchor chains
parted and the schooner was blown
ashore the next day. The story of tha
wreck, told by a member of the crew,
is thrilling. He says the first intima
tion he had that a storm of more than
usual severity was prevailing was when
the man on watch aroused the officers
and they in turn called the crew quick,
ly from their berths. The little vessel
was then tossing like a frail shell on
the huge waves that the heavy gala
sweeping inland was driving before it.
The night was very dark, and while
slight fears were felt by some of those
aboard, It was not thought the vessel
would drag her anchors. An exception
ally heavy gust of wind, followed by a
heavy wave broke one of the two an
chor chains and the little craft swung
around. This was quickly followed by
the snapping of the chain that held the
second anchor and, buffeted in all di
rections by the violent storm, the boat
was rapidly driven shoreward.
The ship's boat had gone in the wash,
so the crew had to swim. The spot
where they landed was some distance
from the nearest habitation, but a boat
was finally secured in time to rescue
Mr. and Mrs. Martin, after several ef
forts and much danger.

WHEAT â The foreign markets showed' lit-j
tie change. - Chicago was l*4c higher on the
day. the strength being largely due to the
growing realization that but a small proper,
tlon of the crop will be fit for milling. - In
fact, as ane dispatch put It: "Millers every
where are fighting like wildcats for all the
choice wheat they can find." said B. A. Eck
hart of the Eckhart & Swan Milling Com
pany.- "That is what's the matter . with
wheat â there is not enough good wheat to go
around."
In this market cash Wheat was unchanged.
The milling demand is being restricted by large
shipments of Flour from the north Into this

Trade in Poultry was still more or leaa
hampered by the strike of the Poultry Dress
em 1 * Union, and the Increased competition of
Game also had a tendency to weaken the
market. Receipts, however, were just about
sufficient to satisfy the demand and there was
no depreciation In values. Game, like Poultry,
was rather weak owing to the labor difficulties
between leading retailers and their employes,
and most kinds of Wild Ducks were quoted
lower. Canvasbacks were mostly poor and
thin and there were too many Sprig on the
market. . Receipts were about lo<> sacks and
there was quit* a quantity of Sprig Ducks
unsold at the close.

arrivals this month up to date, combined with
the quantity -of Colonial coal now 'In yard,
will keep our market liberally supplied for
the moment. There are . at present but nine
teen vesseU en route and loading Australian
coal, the carrying capacity being less than
50.000 tons; at this time last year there were
thirty- three vessels on the loading list with
an aggregate capacity of 110.000 tons. This
evidences that there will be no overplus of
Colonial ooal here this year for oar winter
detnaml; the cargoes which have recently ar
rived., combined with those listed to arrive
during the year, will assuredly find eaget
purrhaiera. The freight rates on coal from
Newcastle to San Francisco still remain high,
with vessels difficult to procure, even at the
advanced rates. This can b* readily account
ed for, as the inducements for tonnage to seek
this port are Â«J!m: outward rate* from here
for the carriage of grain and lumber still re
main depressed. There are no changes to note
In the quotations of local coals in yard, a.Â»
the wholesale dealers setm disposed to make
no change in their schedule of values for the
present."

poration to secure certain bonds issued
by the company and. also against nu
merous other defendants, to determine
the title to more than 30,000 acres of
land under the grant of March 3, 1871;
to ascertain what portions of the lands
have been sold to bona fide purchasers;
for the cancellation of patents on the
lands still owned by the company, and
for an accounting for moneys received
by the corporation for such lands to
the extent of $1 25 per acre.
The railroad company had received
I-'atents for the lands under an errone
ous interpretation of the law. It was,
says the Court of Appeals, a clear mis
take to convey any right or title what
ever to the railroad company in any
of the lands in question. The company
sold part of the property to bona fide
purchasers, in many cases receiving
more than the Government price there
for.

PARALLELS RIVAL LINE.
Since. the announcement was made
by the Diamond Match Company's offi
cials, their road, has passed to the con
trol of a Harriman corporation organ
ized in this city seven months ago and
at the head of which is* Colonel John
C. Klrkpatrick, manager of the Sharon
Estate Company, who figures as a di
rector,^ treasurer or president in" a
number of; Harriman railroad enter
prises. 'After acquiring the Butte
County Railroad the Harriman corpo
ration ; leased the former back to the
Diamond Match Company, which now
manages it." A few weeks ago rails
were laid northward from : Stirling for
a distance of about five miles, and
when curious people began to' ask
questions' they were' informed that the
extension was simply, designed to en
able the : Diamond': Match' Company to
reach its timber properties and bring
its logs into Stirling.
The presence at the . Palace . Hotel
during the past few days of several di
rectors of the Butte County j Railroad
has brought to light the fact that E. H.
Harriman is preparing to invade the
territory In Northern California
through which the Western Pacific
Railway is arranging to build. Recent
visitors to Chico and the new town of
Stirling, where the Diamond Match
Company has established big sawmills,
have noticed with considerable wonder
the large amount of railroad work be
ing done in that neighborhood.
Although the Diamond Match Com
pany's representatives .announced,
when they completed the laying of rails
on the Butte County route from Chlco
to Stirling, that the latter town would
be the terminus of the new road for a
number, of years to come, it is now
known that the objective point for
which the road is destined is some
place, in Nevada, which will be
reached by way of the Big Meadows
and Freddnla Pass, through which. the
Western Pacific has made a survey.

\ The trial of Lieutenant George Rich
ards Jr., 'charged with duplicating his
pay accounts, was resumed at the Pre
sidio yesterday morning.
The principal witness was the father
of the accused, George S. Richards Sr.,
one of the, magnates of the Standard
Oil trust. The plea put forth by
Lieutenant Richards was that the
cause of all his trouble was temporary
insanity. The father testified that
Lieutenant Richards was always a
bright boy, and that there was never
anything In his actions previous to his
joining the army to denote that he was
not perfectly sarie. In fact, Richards
Sr. said that his son had always been
mentally capable,- and at college was a
brilliant mathematician. He had In
herited these qualifications from his
father, as weir as from his- mother.
Since his son's return from Manila,
the father declared, his action's had
changed. . During , his" cross-examina
tion by Judge Advocate. Jphn.'J. Brad
ley, the witness would occasionally get
very "crusty." He evidently didn't
like the questions put â¢ to him, and
once he remarked, "I am getting tired
of this." The case will be resumed at
10 o'clock this morning.
Colonel E. A. Goodwin and the
Third Squadron, Ninth Cavalry, will
depart on Saturday morning for Jef
ferson Barracks, Mo.
'The following officers called at de
partment headquarters yesterday:
Lieutenant J. M. Petty, Twentieth In
fantry, on leave of absence, and Cap
tain Louis H. Bash, Seventh Infantry,
who is "staying at the Bohemian Club.
In response to a query from Mr. Sul
livan, Mrs. Monnier said she and her
husband had never legally adopted
George.
Attorney Sullivan, in a cross-exam
ination, asked Mrs. Monnier If she had
testified In Judge Hunt's court that
George was her son or Monnier*s son
and she replied that the question was
not asked if he was an adopted or
natural son. If it had been asked
she would have told the truth.
Mr. Sullivan then questioned her as
to the baptism of the boy in the
French church in 1882. She Baid that
her sister-in-law and the latter's hus
band, now dead, had been George's
sponsors. The elder Monnier "was not
present when the boy was named
George Jr. and she could not remem
ber whether the names of his parents
were given. She Insisted that she sign
ed no records at the baptism. On other
points her memory was at fault. Mr.
Sullivan has a copy of the baptismal
record. â¢
In that deposition she said that she
was not his mother and had no knowl
edge that Monnier was his father; that
he had been â¢ brought to them by a
woman named Mrs. Darling when he
was 3 years old.
In the affidavit, it was also stated
that he and his attorneys need more
time to secure witnesses who will
prove the charge that Monnier made
his will under the undue influence of
his wife, leaving her all of his estate,
worth $150,000.
Not being prepared with a counter
affidavit. Mr. Collins called Mrs. Mon
nier to the stand and she said that she
never made the statement that George
Monnier Jr. was the natural son of
Monnier. nor had Monnier made such
a statement to her. She said positive
ly that the young man was not her son.
HER FORMER TESTIMONY.
He was, he says, always treated
as a son by George and Anna
Monnier, and was always a mem
ber of the family. In an action In
Judge Hunt's court in 1901 for divorce
from Violet Monnier, Mrs. Monnier had
testified, he said,* that she was his
mother. He did not know, he declares,
that Anna Monnier would deny that he
was a son of George Monnier until last
Saturday, when she gave her deposi
tion before Edna T. Keating, a notary
public.
31TSTERIOUS WOMAN.
Attorney George D. Collins repre
sented the widow, Anna Monnier, and
Matt Sullivan and Theo. J. Roche ap
peared for the contestant. The latter
won their point and obtained a contin
uance until November 2, which is the
date set for the beginning of the Dol
beer trial and if the greater contest is
ready the Monnier case will go over.
Mrs. Monnier, veiled, was In court
with her lawyer and on the stand she
said she was not the mother, nor was
Monnier the father of the young man.
The contestant's reasons for demand
ing a continuance were set forth in an
affidavit read by Mr. Roche and in
asking for four weeks more time in
which to prepare for trial it was stated
that Monnier Jr. wants to find wit
nesses who were present at his birth,
or who can throw some light on his
paternity.
tinuance,
Another hint at the mystery sur
rounding the parentage of George
Monnier Jr. and a forecast of the nat
ure of the testimony to be introduced
in his contest of George Monnler's will
developed* in Judge Coffey's court yes
terday morning during a verbal pas
sage at arms between the attorneys
for both sides over a motion for a con-
Ernest N. Bales told a straightfor
ward story yesterday before the
Coroner's . jury as to the man-;
ner in which the shot was fired that
killed Mrs. Annie Engelberg last j
Thursday on Portola street. His testl- :
mony and that of other witnesses con- ;
vinced the Jury that while he was in !
the act of getting out of a buggy his!
revolver dropped out of his overcoat j
pocket and, striking on the pavement, j
was discharged. A verdict of accidental i
death was returned and Bales was ex- j
onerated. The Jury mentioned him In j
the verdict as "the defendant," proba
bly a pardonable error under the cir
cumstances.
Bales is a drug clerk and of refined
and gentlemanly appearance. He wore ,
glasses and gave his testimony in a
very self-possessed and intelligent
manner. The bearing and aspect of the
man were in strange contrast with the
large size and formidable appearance
of the weapon that he carried on his
last ride with his sweetheart. It was I
a Coifs revolver of navy size and of.
.45 caliber. In answer to an Inquiry by \
Coroner Leland, Bales explained that :
Mrs. Engelberg had insisted upon his;
carrying the firearm whenever they j
went riding, because four years ago she i
had been stopped by footpads in Golden !
Gate Park and robbed of much valu- j
able jewelry. The witness explained j
that she always wore diamonds when ;
on an outing and that he had carried j
the revolver more with the object of i
allaying her fears than of any desire
to use It.
"We stopped at the Casino," he con"-.!
tinued, "and she had one or two cock- j
tails, but she was perfectly sober at the
time of the shooting."
"Were you sober?" asked the Cor
oner. ,';'.*
"Yes; I never drink."
"What did you take at the Casino?"
"A glass of milk or "soda water. :
That's what I usually take." j
Then Bales explained how the accl- ;
dent happened. He had driven up in
front of No. 50 Portola street, Mrs. En
gelberg being on the left hand side of
the buggy and near the sidewalk. She
got out first and stood near the horse's
head, facing Bales. He had one fo'ot
on the buggy step, the other on the
curb, when he saw the flash at his feet j
and heard the report of the revolver, j
Mrs. Engelberg exclaimed "Oh!" and
fell. He ran to her and endeavored to j
stanch the flow of blood. Bystanders 'Â¦
immediately gathered round and a phy- j
slcian was called, but the unfortunate 1
woman had passed beyond the reach of.
human aid.
Bales was released yesterday after
noon by order of Captain Burnett.
Incidentally the Mayor assails the
proprietors of the Bulletin and Chron
icle, which, he alleges, have been de
faming his administration.
I stroncly advise them to agitate this sub
ject, rather than to allow themselves to be
made, for political purposes, the mistaken
tools of the avowed enemies of an adminis
tration which is sincerely their friend.
In conclusion I will eay that the proceed
ings in this matter have disclosed that a fail-
Jr. cflf In the demand for certain brands . of
cirars bearing the union label is due to a
j-frtain extent to the fact that union men dc
not call lor thoÂ« brands. If the men inter
ested In the unions and In the union label,
on roods of home production manufactured
by white labor, would call for the same. I am
pure that the demand would be so largely in
Â«TÂ«-ated that the Clear-makers' Union would
have en :ts hands more work than its mem
bers could do.

hold a naturfei. logical, legitimate and un

by fcavinr much a position.
Mayor Schmitz yesterday made pub
lic his findings in the matter of the
complaint of the Cigar-makers' Union
that Police Commissioner Drinkhouse
bad used his official position to ad
vance his business interests and ask
ing for his removal from office on that
account. In his findings the Mayor
says that the charges against Drink
house have not been sustained after
a fair and impartial trial and he
therefore must refuse to ask for the
resignation of Drinkhouse.
In a typewritten statement the
Mayor reproduces the letter sent to
him by the Cigar-makers* Union on
the subject' and then quotes from the
transcript of evidence in the trial to
show that Drinkhouse was guiltless of
any wrongdoing. He says in conclu
sion:
