The traffic of the" State of Washington

he control the commerce of Puget

Refugees who have Jusf arrived from

THS WEATZSB.VLADIVOSTOK, July 29.â The naval
men here cannot understand why the
British and American papers should be
questioning the legality of the actions
of the Vladivostok squadron in the Pa
cific. The Russian cruisers, it is as
serted, are acting under the rules for
mulated in regard to prizes a.nd im
perially confirmed March 27, 1895. It
is further claimed that the British
Government, instead of complaining,
should take steps to compel her ship
owners to desist from carrying contra
band, in accordance with King Ed
ward's neutrality proclamation, in
which he said:
"I give notice that all our subjects
whq transgress will do so at their own
peril and risk, and will under no cir
cumstances receive our protection."
LONDON, July 29.â Russia has filed
a formal protest at the Foreign Office
against British shipment of contra
band to Japan. The Russian Gov
ernment since the beginning of the war
has carefully watched the manufacture
of goods intended for the use of the
Japanese Government, and as soon as
it was established that such goods
were about to be shipped to a hostile
destination the facts were officially
communicated to the British Govern
ment, with the request that measures
be taken to put a stop to it. It is as
serted that in many cases the Govern
ment has not taken action, and it is
understood that when the war ends
Russia proposes to present a bill for
damages to the British Government,
which will offset the indemnities claim
ed for the seizure of British steamers.

the transportation of a considerable
number of people to and from the

ARABIA IS AT VLADIVOSTOK.
German Steamer Captured by Rus
sians In Charge of Prize Crew.
VLADIVOSTOK. July 29.â The Ger
man steamship Arabia, under charter
of an American company, which was
captured by the Russian cruiser Gro
moboi July 22 a hundred miles north of
Yokohama, has arrived here in charge
of a prize crew.
That portion of the steamship's cargo
which is alleged to be contraband
comes from Portland, Or. The Arabia,
with two other ships of the Hamburg-
American Company, is under charter
for three years to the American Trad
ing Company, which it is asserted is
engaged in carrying contraband. She
Is commanded by Captain Bahle and
has a crew of ten Germans and ttventy
seven Chinese. According to statements
by the Chinese on board, many Ameri
can steamers are engaged in carrying
contraband.*
The Arabia left Portland July 2 with
a cargo of flour and railroad material.
The greater portion of the flour â 270S
tonsâ "was addressed to Hongkong and
is not liable to seizure, but 466 tons of
flour and 542 tons of railway material
are addresed to Yokohama, Kobe and
Nagasaki, and consequently are con
traband. The iron of the cargo con
sits of platforms, wheels, axles, boilers
and parts of bridges! As the contra
band of war aboard the Arabia forms
less than half her cargo the vessel her
self is not liable to seizure. After the
contraband has been discharged, there
fore, the ship will probably be released.
The final decision as to her disposition
rests with the prize court. The prize
crew on board consists of Lieutenant
Vladislale and forty-two men from the
cruiser Gromobol.
WASHINGTON. July 29.â The Japa
nese Minister here has received the fol
lowing cablegram from the Foreign Of
fice at Tokio, dated to-day:
"General Oku reports further that ac
cording to the statements of Russian
officers captured during the recent bat
tle General Kuropatkin was present on
the battlefield and that Generals Saka
loff and Kondratsvitch were wounded.
Also that the Russian casualties were
about 2000. The Japanese casualties
were about 1000. and General Oku re
ports that investigations are being
made regarding the number of prison
ers taken and the quantity of munitions
of war, etc., captured."
ST. PETERSBURG, July 29.â Since
the Russian retreat from Tatchekiao
and the taking of Newchwang by the
Japanese the feeling here has grown
suddenly more pessimistic. With the
Japanese able to get around General
Kuropatkin's right from Newchwang.
with their forces pressing in upon Hai
cheng from the c-J*?L and a Japanese
column threatening the Russian com
munications above Liaoyang, the with
drawal of the entire Russian army
northward may be absolutely neces
sary.
LIAOYANG, July 28 (Delayed in
transmission). â Further details of the
fighting below Tatchekiao July 23 and
24 indicate that the Japanese losses
may reach 5000 men. The Russian losses
are officially stated to be about 700.
The Russian front was much extend
ed. The Japanese concentrated their
attack against the Russian left, but
were repeatedly repulsed. The Russians
made several brilliant bayonet charges,
and for the first time the Russian ar
tillery was used in high angle fire from
behind a hill, the fire being directed by
telephone from an eminence and attain
ing great precision. The Russians did
not retire until it was established that
the Japanese had seven divisions.
The Russian forces are concentrated
at Haicheng, and probably will not re
tire farther. It is expected that the
Japanese will now advance against the
left flank of the Russian southern
army.

RUSSIANS GROW PESSIMISTIC.
Twenty bystanders were injured by
the explosion of the bomb, but only
seven of them were seriously hurt.
The reauiem service at M. von
Plehwe's house to-night was most im
pressive. The house was beautifully
decorated with flowers. Madame von
Plehwe and her son were present at the
ceremony, as also were many officers
and diplomats. A nun in the habit of
her order knelt before the coffin inton
ing prayers fcr the dead. These pray
ers will be continued without interrup
tion until after the burial.
The Czar was not present at the re
quiem to-nipht, but he will attend the
funeral Sunday afternoon.
The papers print unusually full and
free accounts of the crime, having been
officially notified that no restriction will
be placed on news or comment save as
they might interfere with the work of
the police in unraveling the conspiracy
back of the crime.
The funeral of Von Plehwe will be
held at the Xovodevichy Monastery, St.
Petersburg; Sunday afternoon.
The ne-.vspapers this morning are
filled with very long accounts of the as
sassination of Minister von Plehwe, bio
graphical sketches of the dead states
man and comments on his character as
a man. All the papers agree that a
great personality has been taken off in
the midst of his work.
The assassin. Lego, also knorwn as
Prozeff, carefully planned the crime.
He says he was animated by humani
tarian motives and does not express
the slightest regret.
An account of the tragedy published
this afternoon says the assassin at
tempted to commit suicide by shooting.
He had a revolver in his hand when
teized. The operation on him was sa
Fuccessful that he is expected to re
cover in three weeks. He is still in
the ho?r>ital. He is a h-crndsom^ man
of about 23 years of age ivith blonde,
Qeular features.
Madair.e Plehwe, widow of the de
ceased statesman, arrived here \o-day.
She is broken down, but is calm. The
Fight of her husband's remains caused
the virtow, who suffers from heart
trouble, a shock, and she fell to the
floor in a fainting condition. Doctors
revived her and later she went to the
Minister's villa en the islands of the
Neva.
FUNERAL DAY SET.
The assassin was examined by an in
vestigating magistrate to-day and re
fused to make any statement
The post-mortem examination of the
remains of Von Plehve shows that his
death was instantaneous.
ST. PETERSBURG^ July 29.â It has
been learned that while the identity
and nationality of the assassin of Min
ister Von Plehve and his accomplice
tire Ft ill not definitely established, the
police are making progress in unravel
ing ihe skein. They are amazed to find
hÂ«\v far-reaching was the conspiracy.
There is nothing yet, however, to prove
its connection with that vl Gerschun
in. The documents found show the ex
istence of a wholesale plot to murder
Ministers, but the most remarkable
feature is that it did not include the
Emperor, who is distinctly declared to
be â¢'uninvolved."
The capture of the accomplices of
the murderer was effected under cir
cumstances showing that the conspira
tors pursued the very plan followed at
the time of the assassination of Alex
ander II. The accomplices then were
posted at several street corners in or
der that if one man failed another
might succeed.

Sinking of the Steamer.
CHEFU, July 29. â Russian refu
gees who arrived hereto-day bring de
tails of the sinking of the steamship
Hipsang," which belonged to the Indo-
China Navigation Company.
She was passing Pigeon Bay within
the three-mile limit early In the morn
ing of July 16 when the forts fired
four times across her bows. She re
fused to stop and four shots were then
fired into her side. As she still con
tinued to steam ahead a Russian tor
pedo-boat ran out and sank her. Four
of her Chinese crew were killed and
eight Chinese passengers were wound
ed. The officers of the steamer, who
are foreigners, and one foreign pas
senger were taken to Port Arthur.
The ctiptain was arrested and placed
in confinement for refusing to stop his
ship.
Three Russian refugees say also
that the Russian torpedo-boat de
stroyer Lieutenant Burukoff was
blown up by coming In contact with
a mine, but that the other two tor
pedo-boats reported to have been lost
managed to reach the Inner harbor.
Land fighting around Port Arthur
continues, but of this the refugees

NEW YORK. July 29.â Captain Van
Schaick and Federal Steamship In
spector Fleming and Former Inspector
Ludberg were indicted to-day by the
Federal Grand Jury in connection with
the disaster to the General Slocum on
June 15 last, when nearly 1000 lives
were lost. Van Schaick was the com
mander of the Slocum.
United States District Attorney Bur
nett said that indictments also were
reported against President Barnaby,
Secretary Atkinson and Treasurer
Becker of the Knickerbocker Steam
boat Company, and ' Captain John
Pease, the commodore of the com
pany's fleet. General Burnett said that
when these men and Captain Van
Schaick and Inspectors Lundberg and
Fleming are arraigned for pleading on
Monday he will insist upon bail being
fixed at $25,000 ln each case.
The equipment of the steamer Grand
Republic, sister ship to the General
Slocum, was 325 life preservers short
when she was inspected early this year,
according to the testimony of Peter C.
Petrie, an assistant hull inspector, at
to-day's session of the Federal Com
mission's investigation of the Slocum
disaster. The Inspector said that when
he reported the matter to Captain
Pease the latter replied: "I've got lots
of them between decks."
"I went to a cabin In the forward
part of the boat between decks." tes
tified the inspector, "and found between
1200 and 1500 life preservers. I made
the crew hand them to me one by one
and I looked every one over. Out of
the whole lot I found only 130 that I
passed."
Petrie^ said he did not order the con
demnation of the preservers, as he had
no authority to do so, but he suceested
to the captain that It would be a eood
plan to get them out of the way. He
saw Captain Pease a month later, when
the captain told him, in reply to a
question, that he still had the con
demned life belts on board of his
steamer.

Pcnfleld respecting a formal presenta
tion to the Russian Government of the
claims of these owners for the de
stroyed cargo. It was arranged that a
written brief should be submitted later
on, embodying the legal points sought
to be made in thi(T)case. It is clear to
the officials here^that, regardless of
any rules which Russia may have laid
dewn for her own Government respect
ing the sinking of neutral ships, the
piactice, opposed as it is to all
modern principles of international
law, cannot be permitted by this Gov
ernment without a strenuous protest.

HEAVY FIRING IS REPORTED OUTSIDE OF NEWCHWANG
SANTA BARBARA, July 29.â Making
her way down the Santa Barbara chan
cel as easily as a pleasure craft in the
shore breeze, the. battleship Ohio, one
of the largest and most formidable
fighting vessels of the new navy, which
is to have her trial trip off this coast,
proceeded to her anchorage in the har
bor shortly before 10 o'clock this morn
ing. The Ohio had an easy trip from
San Francisco, and the 24,000 tons of
steel and armament were propelled
down the coast and to her anchorage
place at the rate of twelve knots an
hour. It was expected the Ohio would
arriy^ in port at 5 o'clock this morning,
but as she sailed under slow speed
during the night in order to permit the
inspection of beacons and to view the
land monuments after daybreak, the
trip was leisurely made.
Rear Admiral Whiting, representing
the United States Government, and
Chief Engineer Forsythe, representing
the Union Iron Works, expressed them
selves as being satisfied with all the ar
rangements and preparations made for
the official trip, which will take place
Monday morning, weather conditions
permitting. The trial trip will be over
a straightaway course, thirty-six miles
and return, the Government requiring
that an average speed of eighteen
nautical miles be made for the first two
miles each way. A ten-mile run will be
made in order that the Ohio may~be
under full speed when the first stake
boat Is passed. Chief Engineer For
sythe expressed entire confidence that
the Ohio would probably exceed the re
quired speed by a' full knot, basing his
judgment upon the recent performance
of the battleship near San Francisco.
If this proves true the Ohio will exceed
the record of vessels of her class.
On board the Ohio are nearly 300 men
in the employ of the builders, and these
have been engaged throughout the day
giving the massive machinery a general
overhauling and cleaning:. The boats
that will attend the Ohio during the
trial trip are the gunboat Annapolis,
the torpedo-boat destroyers Perry, Paul
Jones and Preble and the Government
tugs Fortune and Unadilla. The Ohio
carries a full armament of sixteen six
inch, twelve three-inch, six nine-pound
er and four Colt automatic guns.

SULTAX GIVES INTERVIEW
TO AMERICAN MINISTER
NEW YORK. July 29. â Five thou
sand persons, all that could crowd
into Cooper Union, cheered them
selves hoarse to-night over the death
of the Russian Minister of the Interior,
Von Plehwe. The mass-meeting was
called by the United Russian Revo
lutionists to celebrate Von Plehwe's
death, which they believe will mark
a new era of liberty for their brethren
in Russia.
Assassination Is Approved.
BERLIN. July 29.â Members of the
M. Witte entourage would not be as
tonished if an imperial summons had
already reached the ex-Minister of
Finance to hasten to St. Petersburg to
take over the portfolio of the unfor
tunate Von Plehwe. Witte expected
to leave for Paris last night after the
commercial treaty with Germany had
been concluded. The assassination at
St. Petersburg, however, induced him
to remain here end hold himself ready
for emergencies. He left for St.
Petersburg to-night.
Witte's staff does not conceal the fact
that Its chief is neither surprised noV
filled with profound regret over Von
Plehwe's tragic fate, which, in com
mon with other liberal Muscovite
statesmen, he had long predicted as in
evitable. For years Witte and Von
Plehwe were enemies. The former Min
ister of Finance realized the suicidal
character of the reactionary regime and
fought against it. Finally Witte him
self fell a victim to Von Plehwe's in
fluence with the Czar.
Friends of Witte say that Von
Plehwe's assassination is a vindication
of the ex-Minister of Finance. They
also say that the Czar might yet save
Russia by clothing Witte with the
power Von Plehwe abused.

General Adna R. Chaffee, chief of
staff of the United States army, ar
rived from Portland early yesterday

was met at the Oakland mole by Gen
eral MacArthur, Colonel Stephen P.
Jocelyn. Colonel W. S. Patten, Major
Parker W. West, Major C. A. Devol and
Captain Charles T. Baker. In his party
were General C. F. Humphrey, quarter
master general, and his aid. Captain
Grote Hutcheson. He was also accom
panied by Mrs. Chaffee, his daughter.
Miss Helen Chaffee, and his son, A. R.
Chaffee Jr., who immediately boarded
the ferry and came to the city. The
general, with the other officers, then
went on board the Slocum, steamed to
Fort McDowell and made a survey.
The discharge camp was next visited.
From there the party drove to the
quarantine station. Alcatraz Island
and Fort Mason were then visited.
Fr^m there the party~)went to the
transport dock at Folsofrt street, then
to the headquarters in the Phelan build
ing, where the general received the
staff officers.
In the evening General Chaffee was
the guest of A. A. Watkins at a dinner
at the Pacific-Union Club.
The following were present: General
Adna R. Chaffee, General C. F. Hum
phrey, General Arthur MacArthur, Col-
Mrs. and Miss Chaffee departed for
Los Angeles last night and A. R. Chaf
fee Jr. went to the Presidio to visit
friends. They will join the general In
Salt Lake on Thursday. This morning
General Chaffee will go to the Presidio
at 9 o'clock. There will be no review of
the troops. He williÂ£o in civilian at
tire and win look over the post, hos
pital buildings and cantonments with a
view of ascertaining their conditions
and the needed requirements for their
improvement. To-night he will go to
Portland and /rom there East via
Boise barracks, Fort Douglas and Fort
D. A. Russell. He was Impressed with
the growth of the coast. His visit to
this department is not a tour of in
spection. He came here to look over
the barracks and posts with an idea
of improvements. He wanted to see
what this department needs. His itin
erary, covering the northern depart
ments, was a tour of inspection, but
his trip here is a side issue. He started
on his tour June 25, beginning at De
troit, and he expects to close his tour
and be in Washington about August
25. General Chaffee will retire in April
1906.

KANSAS CITY. July 29.â Rioting
was renewed in the packing-house dis
trict to-day, when a gang of strikers,
mostly Austrians. attacked L. King,
a negro special policeman, as the latter
was entering the plant of Armour &
Co. King shot two of his assailants.
Nat Sullivan and Max Lameska,
neither seriously. Six arrests were
made.
Among the mob was Nat Sullivan, a
deputy sheriff. He made no effort to
quell- the riot, but instead, took part
in the chase of the negro, who waa
showered with stones. King made a
stand, and raising his revolver, fired
rapidly at the mob. At the first few
shots the pursuers came to a halt and
began to scatter. Sullivan fell with a
bullet wound in his thfgh, and La
meska limped away, with a bullet In
his ankle.
King emptied his revolver, while th*
mob scattered, fleeing In all directions.
When a squad of police arrived, most
of the men had escaped. Sullivan. La
meska, King, Andy Bidhoe, George
Bulowich and John Nicholson were ar
rested, the last three named for throw
ing stones.
As a resultfof the rioting special po
lice were s\#orn in and sent to the
packing-house district to-day and or
ders were given not to allow crowds to
gather. All the packing-houses were in
operation to-day with slight change
from yesterday. About fifty strike
breakers who have been working at
the Fowler plant did not return to
work to-day, evidently being afraid of
being attacked by strikers or their
sympathizers.
The strikers succeeded in turning
back forty men brought by the Cudahy
Company from Joplin. Committees
have been appointed to aid members
who may be in want until money to
pay their strike benefits arrives from
Chicago.

DENVER, July 29.â The News to-day
prints the following from an interview
with President Charles H. Meyer of the
"Western Federation of Miners, who is
here to confer with officials of that or
ganization:
'"It is time to call out the troops again
to protect our men in the Cripple Creek
district. There is no legal authority
there now. The Sheriff's ofnee cannot
control things. A mob controls, and
our men are being subjected to white
cappings, whippings and every sort of
brutal treatment. The Governor Ignores
the real issue. He asks that we call off
the strike because he has called off the
militia, and then let the peoirte decide
who is right. If the people were to de
cide that the Governor's military pol
icy was right, that would not settle a
single question at issue."

Ryder and Joseph Korbe, strikers, were
badly beaten by packing-house watch
men, while the latter were trying to
unload a number of strike breakers
from a train at Swift's packing-house.
The strikers were trying to induce the

Several shots were fired, but nobody

WASHINGTON. July ;?. â President
Roosevelt began his official duties in
the executive offices early to-day. Gen
eral O. O. Howard called to inform
him that during the campaign he ex
; ected to appear on the stump ror
him.
Dubois has been a persistent foe to
Morr.ionism, and It was through his,
( fforts that the anti-Mormon plank was
inserted in the Democratic national
platform. Judge Parker wa.Â« greatly
interested In his visitor's talk of the
{Â¦olitical situation in the mining State?.
Dubois told Parker that there is no
â¢ioubt of the President's popularity in
Idaho. Colorado, Nevada and Utah, but
that he believed Roosevelt's popularity
there would not be able to counteract
the effect of labor troubles. Incident
ally Senator E'ubois made public the

Four thousand, three hundred and
nineteen cards have been Issued to
miners of the Cripple Creek district by
the Mine Owners' Association and 300
applications are still on file. Of the
total number issued to-day more than
2100 have been in exchange for cards
surrendered by former members of the
Western Federation of Miners, who
have renounced allegiance to the organ
ization. Never have more than 4500
miners been employed in the Crioole
Creek mines at one time, and then
only when all the lÂ«rrger mines were
working a night shift, and at no time
has the Federation membershlD been
much in excess of 2000.
McCarvel waa originally deported for
openly expressing sympathy with the
Miners* Union and denouncing the act*
of Governor Peabody and his military
subordinates.
CRIPPLE CREEK. July 29.â Patrick
McCarvel, one of the men who was de
ported to the Kansas line by the mili
tary in June, to-day returned to Victor,
where he owns property, including a
large hall and business block, valued
at J23.0C0. When McCarvel disembarked
from the train he was taken in charge
by Major H. A. Naylor. acting city
marshal. McCarvel was allowed to at
tend to seme business affairs and waa
then placed on board the first outgoing
train with a warning that in future
police protection would not be afforded
him should he again return.
Moldy planks were thrown about to placate
sectional prejudices, while one might imagine
in every case the thrower muttering sotto voce.
â¢"Give my chewing gum to stater; I don't want
It any more." Bailey of Texas, when angry,
shouted that they had taken "a pig in a poke."
The Mississippi leader complained of "the mob
and the rabble" present. Hobson could think
of nothing to recommend Cleveland except that
he had bad the courage to quiet a mob. Bryan
pleaded for harmony and promised to agree
that New Tork should have the privilege of
pulling: Davis' leg, and as soon as he got horns
verified his promise by giving out a new
platform for a radical Democracy, In which
he coupled the doctrine of government owner
ship of railroads with the obsolete sectionalism
of state rights. Indeed the whole spectacle
has been that of a raid on a soupbouse by
gentlemen of reduced circumstances.'
I can see no reason why any of my views
can be of any public Interest, excepting so
far aa they may serve to crystallize the senti
ment of others, who are as independently
situated as I have been, and to them, one
and all. and to all Democrats who dislike
the common rabble of hungTy office seekers,
trampling upon rood bread to capture tinsel
wrappings. I say a good "bird in the hand
is worth two In the bush." and safer than a
"pic In a poke."
I may bÂ» and no doubt am somewhat Â¦ pre
judiced in favor of Roosevelt. Irrespective of
his party connections, because he has always
appealed to me as the kind of a man I would
like to have in private life for a personal
friend, a neighbor, a brother-in-law, a business
agent, a mining partner, or a protecting com
panion for my wife and children In a situa
tion of peril. In other words, I feel like sing
ing on the street. "He'll be my man or I'll
have no man at all.
Expressed tersely the campaign presents to
me only the choice between Roosevelt of the
United States of America, experienced. In har
ness, respected and trusted, and Judge Parker
of the State of New Tork, an unknown quan
tity of respectable promise, but with no ex
perience among the people outside his State
and profession, associated with very shrewd
politicians, who are known to have no sym
pathy with the common people.
MOLDT DEMOCRATIC PLAXKS.
Roosevelt, his recognized sincerity, vigor
and public character, together with his advan
tage of position, which, worthily filled, implies
a certain right to demand popular support, his
record and his estimation by the intelligent
powers of the world, the character. Intelli
gence, ability and patriotism of the ir.cn who
art perceived to be nearest in his counsels,
his known, direct and untratnmelert close ap
proach to the rank and file of the whole peo
ple without taint of class prejudice or sec
tional favoritism, and with all these promi
nent features of his candidacy, his known fa
miliarity with all sections of this great coun
try and his sympathies born of experience
with all claeses. from the pioneers of thÂ«
plains to the salons of culture and refinement
â these constitute the issue presented by the Re
publican National Convention: a presentation
made with unanimity as a tribute of public
conflder.ee In a typical live American, who fits
and fully fills his preseju position and satisfies
the popular idea of safe leader for the future.
The St. Louis convention presents an issue
for momentary consideration and it would now
bÂ» hard to characterize It as in any sense
Democratic cr representative of any common
bond of sentiment, sympathy cr political prin
ciple, emanating from any great body of cit
izens of a national character. The leader pre
sented Is absolutely unknown as to all those
dispositions and qualifications essential to the
popular idea of a chief executive of a great
nation and he cannot be made Known through
the platform adopted at St. Louis, which we
all know does not contain a single plank fairly
representative of even a majority of the party
supposed to be represented. His letter of
acceptance may present a new platform, but
it will be the platform of Judge ParkefiJiVho
is known only to the people of New Torkr the
most conceited, the most arrogant, the moct
provincial and the most selfish of all the
States in the Union, when viewed politically
and commercially, and the one State that con
tains great public men. who do not extend
their vision or their personal experience as
far west even as Chicago.
'Â¦ At the St. Louis convention there were sin
cere men battling for the recognition of favor
ite principle*, but all were respectively in a
minority and confronted by one State that
played the rote of dog in .the manger, and a
large majority of hungry office seekers, whose
ambition and political morality was voiced
by Senator Daniels when he gave utterance to
the will of the majority, which was to bury
all contention for principles and surrender to
the New Tork political gamblers for the sole
purpose of securing offices and the scarcely
veiled sack. Since the nomination there has
been evident only one question among the or
ganizers and that Is. "'Who shall hold the
sack?"
That & change Is eominy with Roosevelt
ejected on his own merits is evident in the pro
found Interest which pervades all our commu
nities, in their serious contemplation of the
relations that exist between Roosevelt and the
people, between Parker and the people, and
the Indifference with which perfunctory party
platforms are treated.
ROOSEVELT THE MAX.
The people are more contented now with the
personnel and character of their President,
their Ministers of Government and their po
litical adAsers than they have ever been since
the daysâ¢; Washington. President Roosevelt
has won public confidence by the stanch loy
alty he has shown in keeping his pledge to
the friends of McKlnley. whose office and mis
sion he was so tragically called upon to fill,
while at the ?ame time fce has not failed to
impress his own individuality and sincere
character upon the minds of all citizens to
such a degree that all feel the electric Influ
ence of a Roosevelt administration dawning
upon the successful execution of a McKinley
trust.
"What do you consider was the
practical result of the Democratic
convention?" was asked by The Call
representative. Mr. Wetmore made
the following statement:
The people have discovered that there is no
vital politicul question, clearly defined.- which
divides the voters into two great parties. The
unification o: the whole country, which was
hrcu~ht about by . the Spanish War, and the
dignintd. self-confident, conscientious and pos
itive attitude which our Government has since
assumed and maintained in representing
American Interests and influence in the af
fairs of the whole world, have established a na
tional ?ririt' which throws a veil over v\a
family quarrels, shuts our skeletons in our
clcsets, tears down all useless interstate
fences, while Extending our national walls to
the extreme limit of our acknowledged rights
and natural srowth of influence.-.
STOCKTON, July 29.â Charles A.
Wetmore, who enjoys a State-wide rep
utation as an expert in viticultural
matters and who has been prominent
in various political and commercial
movements, has returned to the Repub
lican party after eight years of enthu
siastic support of Bryan, and is now
energetically championing the candi
dacy of President Itoosevelt. He says
that he sincerely regrets that he is not
younger so that he could make his
espousal more effective by an active
campaign.
Wetmore left the Republican party
on the silver issue, and is now free to
confess that he is glad to again be in
touch with his former political asso
ciates.

-Leed, a negro," caused much excitement
at the stockyards to-day. He was ar
rested after a struggle and found to be
carrying a loaded revolver. The police
are in doubt whether Leed is insane
or only shimming.
Eighty negroes being transported
from the stockyards in two cars on
the Lake Shore road were thrown into
a panic by a furious attack by a mob
of 200. throwing stones which demol
ished nearly every window in both cars.
The explosion of a torpedo warned the
engineer to stop.
Instantly a mob rushed out from
places of. concealment and the rock
throwing began. Three policemen
standing upon the platforms beat
back the rioters, while the frightened
negroes hid under the car seats, while
the train pulled away from the scene.
Attempt to smuggle out non-union
meat from the stockyards through sub
terfuge to-day resulted in an exciting
chase and the complete failure of the
plan. The meat had been loaded by
Armour & Co. into a' wason of the 1
Golden was* liberated only on condi
tion that he remain away from labor
headquarters until after his hearing
to-morrow. George T. Busse, the offi
cial of the Teamsters' Union who was
arrested with Golden, was likewise
freed, on -bonds.
International President Shea of the
Brotherhood of Teamsters was out
spoken in his denunciation of the ar
rest of Golden. "Colorado methods
seem to prevail," raid he.
Inspector Hunt also issued a verbal
manifesto that the police will no longer
permit strike leaders to issue or dis
seminate orders to the members of the
unions, save in private halls.
Regarding the manifesto as a parallel
to the attitude taken by the authorities
In Colorado, the strikers were thrown
into an ugly mood.
Clarence Morris, a non-unionist, for
merly in the employ of Armour & Co.,
was set upon by a mob of strikers,
to-day and severely beaten.
George Sunler, a supposed strike
breaker, and Edward Johnson, said to
be a non-union man, were also at
tacked and are in a serious condition.
MOB ATTACKS NEGROES.
Later, however. President Golden,
after a stormy talk with Police In
spector Hunt, in which International
President Shea of the teamsters' or
ganization took part, was liberated on
bail.
It was the first time a chief of the
striking thousands was taken into cus
tody.
RELEASED OX BATIj.
"Anywhere I please so long as I at
tend to my own business." was the
reply, whereupon Golden ordered the
driver to turn back.
The inspector heard the command
and reassured the teamster, telling him
t(/ go on about his business. Then
came a war of words. Hunt, shaking
his club at the strike leader, declared
there would be an immediate arrest
if Golden did not shut up. He refused
and the arrest followed.
The arrest caused great excitement
and within two minutes seven>4 thou
sand men had gathered to w&ich the
proceedings. ' .
"This is an outrage." declared Gold
en. "I have been guilty of no offense
against the law."
At the time of Golden's arrest the
police also took into custody G. T.
Busse, who was in the teamsters' head
quarters. He was charged with inter
fering with an officer.
Both prisoners were taken to the sta
tion in a patrol wagon. Bail was re
fused them at first and they were sent
to cells vehemently protesting against
what they declared was an outrage.
Following the arrest of George Gold
en, chief of the Packing Teamsters' Un
ion, for picketing, riots became more
frequent near the stockyards this aft
ernoon. In one disturbance a mob cap
tured a loaded meat wagon after it had
left the stockyards, upset the wagon
and thi*w the meat into the street. The
most serious riot of the day occurred
in South Chicago, where five men were
arrested for trying to prevent the de
livery of meat. Although the strikers
and their friends became boisterous
when it became known that Golden had
been arrested and made all sorts of
threats, no one was seriously injured in
any of the many disturbances that oc
curred. The police -have the situation
so well in hand that before the rioters
can get fairly started in their purpose
they are scattered by the bluecoats.
More business was done to-day by
the packers than at any time since the
strike began. With to-day's additions
to the new employes obtained from
outside sources, the statement was
made to-night by one of the packers
that fully 13,000 men were at work in
the seven plants where the union men
are on strike. This is nearly half as
many men as went on strike. The
packers declare that they have more
unskilled labor than they want and
that when all the skilled labor which
they have procured in other cities
reaches Chicago all the by-product
plants will be opened for operation.
PRESIDENT GOLiDEX ARRESTED.
President George F. Golden of the
Teamsters' Union turned strike picket
to-day, defied Police Inspector Nicholas
Hunt and was arrested. Golden, dis
covered a wagon owned by Terry &
.Co. being driven past his offices. HÂ©
called to the teamster: "Where are
'you going?"
"We shall be glad to confer with rep
resentatives of the packers at any
time," said Donnelly. "While I cannot
say that our position is in any way
changed, we are not anxious to keep
up a running fight, and shall be glad
if a settlement can be effected."
UIOTS BECOME' FREQUENT.
CHICAGO, July 29.â Unable to ar
range a conference with representa
tives of .the New York packers," Michael
J. Donnelly, president of the Amalga
mated Meat Cutters and Butcher
Workers of America, has ordered a
strike of all the members of the or
ganization employed in New York by
Schwarzschild & Sulzberger and the
United Dressed Beef Company. The or
der was telegraphed to New York to
night.
That the probabilities of a settlement
by the opposing interests in Chicago
are as remote as ever was plainly
demonstrated to-day, when Henry C.
Wallace of Des Moines, Iowa, and A. L.
Ames of Buckingham, Iowa, called on
the packers with a proposal from the
strike leaders offering to concede the
most important points in the contro
versy if the employers would agree to
renew peace negotiations. Wallace and
Ames were told by the packers that
there was no possible chance for any
further conciliatory move and that the
packers were now in a position where
they could ignore the labor unions, and
that they purpored to ignore the strik
ers. The packers' answer was delivered
to the strike leaders, and the men from
Iowa left to-night for home. â.
*From a statement made by President
Donnelly to-night it would appear that
the men are becoming anxious to re
turn to work.
Disorders at Nelson, Morris & Co.'b
branch In South Chicago to-day caused
the arrest of five men who had attacked
retail meat dealers going for supplies
and overturned two wagons. The lead
ers were arrested.
Great Western Art Company and,
eluding the vigilance of the pickets,
the driver had passed out of the yards.
The pickets shortly after learned the
facts. They mounted a street car. over
took the driver and compelled the man
to turn back to the yards, -where the
meat was unloaded.

PERSONAL.
"William Olson of Carters has agreed to sell
to W. C. Stanley of San Jose the Joslah and
Venezuela quartz mines situated half a mile
from the junction of the North Fork and main
Tuolumne rivers. The purchase price hi $15,000.
The agreement Is dated June 2. 1904. On the
12th Instant Uie option was assigned to the
Mor.a'Gold Mining, Milling and Power Com
pany.' A. Ia Ellis. A. B. Tryon. S. J. Mayock.
J. M. "Palmer and Georse E. Stayton have
entered into an agreement to sell to the
Jerome Canon Copper Company of Arizona the
Badger quartz mine, situated about five miles
west of Jamestown and near Bear Creek. The
purchase price is $12,000, payable before June
16, 1005. The purchasers are to pay to the
present owners 20 per cent of the products
from working the mine, which is to apply on
the purchase price. The management win In
stall a 110-llght dynamo at the Draper mine
to light the surface works. Three stamps are

receive $400 <JoTvn and the balance of $11,000 to
be paid by April 2. 1005. The two agreements
were filed for record Monday afternoon. The
land is described as the northeast quarter of
section 33, township 31 north, ransre 5 west,
and containing 158 acres. The deal Includes
also the water ditch and water right of what
Is known as the Townsend's Flat Water
Ditch Company, and the stock thereon.
The Prince mine in Altaville, Calav
eras County, has been bonded by the
owners to Charles H. Bean, of Los
Angeles, and J. F. Hamby. of Calavr
eras. The gravel property owned by
R. Wise, of Oakland, and situated on
Poverty Flat, a short distance - from
Whisky Slide, is developing. The mill
of the Melones mine at Melones is run
ning day and night on ore. A new mill
will be installed in August by the San
Andreas Gold Channel Mining Com
pany.
The Tuolumne Independent says:
The Gibson ranch of 158 acres on Clear
Creek, Shasta County, will be worked
by W. L. Leland with gold dredging
apparatus, .according to the Redding
Free Press, which says:
Of the companies operating in the Kern
River field nine pay regular monthly dividends,
amounting to $74,500. or $S94.00O per year. The
aggregate land owned by these nine com
panies is about !Â»."y acres, about one-fifth of
the proven territory of the field, and less than
one-quarter of this Â»50 acres is developed.
Appropriately speaking, there are 5000 acres
of proven oil land In the Kern River field, anil
there are considerably less than 1000 pro
ducing wells. One well Is supposed to drain
the oil from about one acre of land, so that
it Is evident that the same ratio of develop
ment holds good throughout the entire field.
The Urgent factor In the Kern River field Is
the Associated Oil .Company, and the Asso
ciated has not yet declared any dividends.
This by no means indicates that the Asso
ciated is not making fully its share of the
money, and It is conservatively estimated
that if the directors chose to distribute the
earnings of the company to the shareholders.
Instead of Investing them in Improvements,
and development work. Its â¢ dividends would
amount to 5 per cent on Its 20.000,000 shares,
or ll.OOO.CCO per year. In addition to the
Associated and the nino companies first re
ferred to, is the Petroleum Development Com
pany, which Is owned by the Santa Fe Rail
road, and the profits of which do not appear
in flcures accessible to the public. There are
also a number of companies that pay quar
terly and semi-annual dividends, and those
also are left cut of the account. With the
profits of th<*se companies added to the
amounts already given in It is evident that
the net returns from the Kern River fteld in
the present depressed condition of the oil in
dustry dops not fall so very far short of $2,000,
000 per year. These figures Â«.re for net profits
with cost of operating, deterioration and bet
terments taken out. They are made, too, on
tho basis of the prices which the companies
havÂ«s been getting for their oil. which is prob
ably not above 20 cents. If the price of oil
can by any moans be made to rise to something
near its actual value the increase will be Just
so much clear m'oney In the pockets of the
producers, as the operating and other ex
penses would not be any greater than now.
DREDGING IN SHASTA.
A good showing is made for the im
measurably rich oil sands of the Kern
River field. .It is reported that the
annual earnings of that oil field alone,
notwithstanding that the price for oil
at the wells is very low, amount to
$2,000,000 a year. The conditions have
not been encouraging to develop new
ground extensively. There are hopes
that the price for crude petroleum will
rlsj again, new and greater demands
being constantly made for it. In due
time the 52,000,000 annual output will
be very largely increased.
A good showing is made for the im
northern part of the State are extend
ing. A considerable tract has been ac
quired on Clear Creek, in Shasta Coun
ty, for operation with large machines.
A northern quartz, mining company
reports earnings for six months
amounting to $305,000.
The Bakersfield Echo; describing the
operations in the Kern River oil field
during the past year, says:
Beginning at the north end of the lod*. a
crosscut Is being driven In the Utah mine on
the 600 level. The Sierra Nevada and Mexi
can mines are connected with the Union shaft,
through which they are to be operated. East
of the Union lies the Scorpion. In which pros
pecting is belne vigorously prosecuted on the
1000 level, being also -worked through tha
Union shaft. The Union; has been overhauled
and placed In good condition a.nd extensive de
velopment planned, but the burning of the
works on the 14th inst. has put a stop for the
time being to all this work. At the Union
shaft was at one time some of the heaviest
pumplne machinery In the world. The great
Cornish pump, with a stroke nearly nine feet

The Mining and Scientific Press pub
lishes some general statements about
the condition of the mines along the
Comstock lode. Three or four years
ago the lode was practically dead, al
most every mine along its entire length
of 20,000 feet being idle. There is some
Improvement. The Yellow Jacket
shaft, 3000 feet deep, was abandoned
when a flood of water rushed in from
the Exchequer mine. The machinery
is at Butte City, where it was sent
after the flood disaster. The shaft will
probably never be reopened. At the
Ward shaft the work of restoration has
progressed to the 1700-foot level, and
a large compressor plant Is going in
to operate drills and to raise the water
from the bottom of the mine to the
Sutro tunnel level. The article con

The military trial of Lieutenant
Charles F. Smith, â¢ who was mixed up
in the Angel Island carousals, was
again taken up yesterday at the Pre
sidio. As during the preceding ses
sions of the court martial, allghe doors
were tightly barred and no one outside
of those directly interested in the case
was allowed in the building.
The chief witness of the day for the
defense was Lieutenant W. w! White,
who participated with Smith In the
orgies. White's testimony, it is re
ported, was mainly directed so as to
shield Smith and draw all the blame
on his own shoulders. From what
could be learned it smacked of a sort
of Damon and Pythias affair. White
was willing to take all the onus of the
bringing at the "ladies" into the camp
upon himself, and wished the court to
believe that he and he alone invited
the "ladies" to come there. As far as
the grand final escapade at the dis
charge camp was concerned it was
made to appear that Smith simply
happened in while the "ladies" were
calling on White and joined the party
to help the evening along.
Other witnesses who gave testimony
yesterday were Privates McClatsky,
Driddle, Barrett and Barry. These
were all guards who were on the prem
ises during the evening of the last
orgies.
The court adjourned at 3 o'clock, to
meet again on Monday morning at 10.
This will probably be the final sitting
of the court. So far it has occupied
nearly three days.
Immediately after the court adjourn
ed yesterday Lieutenant White was
taken back to Angel Island under
guard.
The target practice which has been
going on for the last week at Ord bar
racks will be finished on next Tues
day. '
The three batteries of field artiliery,
under command of Captains C. A.
Bennett, John L. Hayden and Ira A.
Haynes, are enjoying anÂ® extensive
practice at Camp Atascadero. The big
ranch affords them ample opportunities
for long distance targets.
Among those going on the transport
Logan, which wiJl sail for Manila on
Monday, will be Lieutenant Colonel T.
C. Prince; Lieutenant J. L. Hines, wife
and child; Commander Edward Stone,
master of the launch Seattle; Lieuten

1016 Broadway, July 29.
A petition for special letters of ad
ministration on the estate of Jose
Leve'-a. filed with the County Clerk
fcere to-day by Martin Leveira, accom
panied with the allegation that he
died at Antioch four days ago, clears
up the mystery of the sudden disap
pearance of the deceased from . his
home at San Leandro about a year and
u half ago.
The old man had been having trouble
with his wife, who was suing him for
& divorce, when he suddenly disappear
ed. It was afterward discovered that
he had securtd $10,000 by mortgaging
some cf his property and it was gener
ally believed that Leveira had returned
to Portugai and that he was spending
vhe remainder of bis days there in
peace.
From the action taken to-day by
Martin Leveira, his son, it shows that
the old man went no farther away
than to Antioch, where he took UP his
residence with his eon. who had sym
pathized with him in his trouble. Le
veira and his wife had been married
since 1854, but of late years 6he ac
cused him of cruelty and pleaded twen
ty-eight charges against him. One suit
was dismissed and then another be
gun. There were eleven children and
they took sides. Â¦ â¢-â¢-,' ;
The contest took on such proportions
that In order to escape it all; Leveira
Quietly slipped away, taking .enough
money with him to supply his needs.
Mrs. Leveira was granted her decree
and given the homestead at 6anX<ean
dro, valued at about $10,000. The In
terlocutory decree granted her a year
Â£%,o has not become final and she â¢will
now be able to have it set aside and
claim a widow's portion of the estate,
Â¦which is valued at about $30,000. Â»

death. The funeral arrangements await
her instructions.

ALAMEDA, July 29.â In a decision
rendered to-day the State Supreme
Court sustains the action of the Su
perior Court of this county, which held
that the local municipal referendum
ordinance was not mandatory upon the
City Trustees and that the latter could
act on matters of public interest that
came before them properly without first
having- to submit the questions to a
general vote. @
The decision of the higher court was
the result of an appeal taken from the
lower court by Henry Rosenthal. Green
Majors and others, who sought through
injunction proceedings to prevent the
City Trustees from granting railroad
franchises to the Southern Pacific Com
pany nine months ago without first
obtaining a sentiment of voters by a
special election. When the Superior
Court held that the referendum ordi
nance did not in any way bind or
prevent the municipal legislators from
acting on the franchises the Board of
Trustees granted the franchises asked
by the Southern Pacific Company.
Rosenthal and Majors carried the
matter to the Supreme Court and en
deavored to procure a permanent in
junction until a decision jcoiild be had.
but their request was denied.

The Board of Supervisors, sitting as a
Board of Equalization, to-day reduced
the assessment on the ferry-boat fran
chises of the Southern Pacific Company
from $800,000 to $15. It also made an
aggregate reduction on the other prop
erties of the company of JS3.500. The
company was represented by E. Black
Ryan, while Assessor Henry P. Dalton
appeared before the board and opposed
the reductions asked for. The entire
morning was spent in 'listening to argu
ments and the matter was finally dis
posed of by ordering the reductions
as stated.

contended that they were a myth, and
that the franchise granted by the State
included in it a franchise to run a ferry
as well as a train. The board cut the
three franchises, aggregating JSOO.OOo.
down to a nominal value of $5 each last
year, and on motion of Supervisor Kelly
it did the same again this year. Super
visors Mitchell and Horner voting aye,
while Supervisor Rowe voted no. Su
pervisor Talcott was absent.
In regard to the reductions of tha
other properties, upon the request of
Ryan the assessment of the ferry-boat
Amador was reduced from $10,000 to
$1500. It was pointed out that the boat
was old and fit only for scrap Iron. The
assessment on the railroad yards at
West Oakland was reduced from $225.
000 to $200,000, the realty Improvemant3
from $50,000 to $40,000. The assessment
on the yards at Fourteenth and Frank
lin streets was allowed to remain at
$178,000, while the Improvements there
were reduced from $75,000 to $50,000.
The block signal system of the com
pany was reduced from $100,000 to
$75,000.
The board decided to assess the ferry
boats plying between San Francisco

valuation, the other half being: assessed
in San Francisco. The valuation will
be fixed at to-morrow's session.

Pupils at the Parental School will be â¢
sent there at the instigation either of !
the Superintendent of Schools or the ;
Judge of the Juvenile Court.
Those boys of the city who need close
supervision and those boy's whose
home environments are not conducive
*o regular attendance at school will be
gathered in the classes of. the school.
Professional truants and those who
have committed minor offenses, but of
a character not so serious that they
should be branded with the stigma of
a reform institution, will all find equal
facilities for improvement, both moral,
educational and physical, under the
ti Ition of Principal Faulkner and his
assistants. One feature of paramount
importance will be the individual in- 1
struction which will be almost gener
ally applied.
The newly established parental or
truant school will be opened, mainly
for recalcitrant youths, on Monday
under the direction of Principal Rich
ard D. Faulkner, who accepted the
position of principal of the school last
Tuesday at the request of the Board
of Education.
The San Francisco Parental School
is the first of its kind west of the
Rockies and in choosing Professor
Faulkner for the position of principal
the board had in view the executive
ability he has shown in his conduct of
the Irving M. Scott and the 'Franklin
Grammar schools.
The Parental School is situated at
the rear of the Franklin Grammar
School, Eighth street, near Harrison.
There are seven rooms, one of which
m; already equipped for manual train-
Ing.
On the hearing here the Government
was represented in chief by Francis J.
Heney as special counsel. Mr. Heney
said yesterday that while he had no di
rect information from Washington he
had no doubt the Government would
appeal to the Supreme Court .from the
Lacombe decision, and he was hopeful
it would be reversed.
The next move on the part of the
Government in the land frauds case
will be made in San Francisco August
During the long hearing before Com
missioner Heacock. Garret W. McEner
ney and other counsel for the defend
ants, Hyde and Dimond, raised the same
point against the indictment that Judge
Campbell made with signal success be
fore Judge Lacombe in New York. They
argued that if any fraud had been com
mitted it was a fraud against the West
em States, whose school lands had been
obtained by illegal means, and that the
Federal Government, having accepted
these lands as an innocent purchaser
for value, ha'd not been defrauded, be
cause the* States could not recover the
school lands by suit against the Gov
ernment. Where fictitious names had
been used, the lawyers further contend
ed, no State lands passed to the Gov
ernment and no lieu lands passed from
the Government, therefore the whole
transaction was void and no fraud was
committed. Commissioner Heacok re
fused to entertain this view, but It
would appear that Judge Lacombe has
held it to be sound lav.-.
GOVERNMENT MAY APPEAL.
John A. Benson was arrested on this
indictment in New York, and therefore
had his preliminary hearing there be
fore Federal Commissioner Shields.
Hyde and Dimond were arrested in San
Francisco. Their preliminary examina
tion began before Commissioner Hea
cock on March 21 and closed May 14.
In both cases the Commissioner held
the defendants for trial at Washing
ton. The fourth defendant, Schneider,
was arrested in Washington, D. C, and
therefore had no preliminary examina
tion.
The indictment which Judge La
combe declares invalid was found by
the Grand Jury of the Supreme Court
of the District of Columbia on Feb
ruary 17. It charges John A. Benson,
Frederick A. Hyde, Henry P. Dimond
and Joost H. Schneider with conspiring
to defraud the Government of large
tracts of Western land by exchanging,
under the forest reserve act, Oregon
and California State school lands ob
tained by fraud for lieu lands outside
the reserves. The title to the State
lands in question is alleged to have
been obtained by the use of forged affi
davits, "dummies" and fictitious selec
tors.
It is true that Benson's alleged co
conspirators, Frederick A. Hyde and
Henry P. Dimond, have been held by
Commissioner He^acock of this city for
trial at Washington and that Judges
de Haven and Morrow, both of wham
will probably be asked to pass on the
Commissioner's ruling, may take a
different view of the law from that
held by the New York Jurist. It is also
true that the Government may appeal
from- Judge Lacombe's decision to the
United States Supreme Court. Such,
however, is Lacembe's reputation for
sound law that it is said his decision
will have great weight with the Fed
eral Judges here. The probability of
the Supreme Court's reversing him is
slight. The case is one in which the
public, especially in the "West, has tak
en great interest.
So far as has yet been learned here.
Judge Lacombe dismissed Benson sole
ly on the technical ground that the in
dictment failed to set fc-rth facts show
ine a conspiracy to commit an offense
under the laws of the United States.
This decision is a triumph for a well
known San Francisco lawyer, ex- Judge
J. C. Campbell, who was Benson's lead
ing attorney at the hearings in New
York. Associated with Campbell was
Frank H Plan of New York City, son
of Senator Platt. The point insisted
upon by Campbell was that if any
fraud was charged in the indictment
it was. a fraud against the States of
Oregon and California and not against
the Covernment of the United States.
GREAT FRAUDS CHARGED.
The decision rendered Thursday by
Judge Lacombe of the United States
Circuit Court in New York discharg
ing John A. Benson of this city from
the Federal indictment for conspiracy
to defraud the Government out of pub
lic lands was accepted by manj San
Francisco lawyers yesteruay as mean
ing the end of the now celebrated land
frauds case.

Champion Starts His Labors in thÂ©

JEFF THINKS TWO WEEKS'
WORK WILL BE ENOUGH
HARBIN' SPRINGS, July 29.â After
one day's preliminary work Jeffries
and his trainers feel that two weeks*
training- will be ample to put him in
the best condition. The work done by
the big fellow in the gymnasium yes
terday is the first systematic exercise
he has taken since he was laid up
He showed up splendidly and per
cpired freely. There was a slight
thickening of his wind, but a couple
of days' work will put his breathing
apparatus in good shape. He devoted
his attention to the bag, shadow box-
Ing and rope skipping and there was
absolutely no Indication of stiffness In
his knee.
for the present Jeff will not indulge
fn any great amount of road work,
but Tvill epend most of his time lim
bering up. He spent much time to
day with the 350-Dound- sandbag in
addition to his other work.
Collier's racing system will be given
its third and last trial to-day on
Spreckels Lake. It has given satisfac
tion on the tv/o previous trials and
if all goes well it will behoove the club
members to adopt the new rules. The
objection to them was that they would
string the Sunday pennant racing out
and make it impossible to dispose of
the pennant in a single day. To test
this the owners were asked to bring
out as many boats as possible. They
did so and the races have been finished
early in the afternoon and have been
enjoyed more than ever before.
The next meeting of the club, which
will be on the second Wednesday night
in August, will be an important one.
The annual election of officers will take
place and the question of pennant rac
ing rules will be decided. If Collier's
rules are rejected, new ones will have
to be formulated, as the old ones as
set forth In the by-laws have not
proved satisfactory. The club will
give a smoker on the night of the
meeting.
The ticket 0 as nominated last "Wed
nesday will undoubtedly go through.
William B. Collier will succeed J. E.
Genung as commodore. The latter has
led the club since its organization and
he has worked wonders. Starting with
a membership of eight two years ago,
he has increased' the membership to
the limitâ 50^â and there is quite a
waiting list. His clubmates were anx
ious to make him their leader again,
but he figures he can accomplish more
as the secretary-treasurer of the club.
Collier is an Indefatigable worker and
will fill Genung's place as no other
member of the club could.

The Alameda County committee of
the Native Sons of the Golden West
for the celebration of Admission day
has adopted an aquatic programme,
comprising junior, intermediate and
senior barge races; junior and senior
outrigged skiff races, and senior and
junior shell races.
The races will be under the manage
ment of the regatta committee of tha
Pacific Association of the Amateur
Athletic Union. The programme also
includes aquatic spoits, which will bÂ©
in charge of the Alameda Boating
Club. The events will be held on Laka
Merritt and bid fair to bring: out a
larger number of oarsmen and keener
competition than the annual champion
ship races on July 4.
At that date the Ariel and the South
End rov.ing clubs had not been Ions
enough in their new quarters to get
thoroughly settled, but they are dis
playing much activity now. Their new
outrigged skiff was received by tha
Ariel Rowing Club only a day or two
before the last races, so that thÂ© scul
lers had no time to practice in it. ShÂ©
has been found thoroughly satisfactory
and several promising skiffmen hava
been developed. A. W. Keegan. Frank
Loth and J. C. Jensen, an Australian,
are in the Junior class, and James Wil
son in the senior class. Â¦Â«"..
The Ariel Club has a senior shell
crew, made up of Charles Wilson, E. J.
Lynch. E. Smith and W. T. Howe, who
are practicing for the annual regatta
at Astoria, which will be held near the
end of next month. The San Francisco
oarsmen who have visited Astoria pre
viously have rowed in four-oared
barges, which are not used for racing
by the Astoria, > Portland, Vancouver.
Victoria or Seattle crews. Consequent
ly it has been necessary to provide
races for the Califomian crews only,
and these have lacked the Interest of
inter-State or international contests.
Attempts have been made to put
Northern crews into barges or Cali
fomian crews into shells at Astoria,
but these have not been successful,
as the oarsmen did not perform well
in unfamiliar craft. The Ariel four will
be the first Califomian crew to take its
own shell up to Astoria.
The Ariel Rowing: Club has bought
two whitehalls and is likely to- add a
pair-oared shell to- its equipment. The
Ariel and South End rowing clubs pro
pose to hold a â¢'ladies' day" Jointly at
their quarters, which are contiguous.
The junior barge crew of the Ariels.
with James O'Connell at No. 2. is
going out regularly for practice and is
getting into form.

In the fourth class, seven players
are left. W. L. Howell has won a place
in the semi-finals, but the other six
have a match to play before qualify
ing. Howell will be pitted against the
winner of the L. Gunst-C. E. Allen
match. The winners of the Getz-
Maguire and Martin-Wollenberg match
will "meet in the semi-finals. These
players ar-e all evenly matched and the
games will be close. ,
Coast Champion Bell made an excel
lent shpwing in the big Eastern tourna
ments last week- He won the New
York State championship, but was
badly beaten by Alexander in the chal
lenge match. Bell, however, made up
for this by playing a close match with
Ward at Longwood. , The Califomian
.won the first set and forced the East-
The annual struggle, for supremacy
on the tennis courts will commence at
San Rafael in about a month. The
newly appointed tournament commit
tee has decided to start the first event
on September 2. The last match will
be played on September 10, which falls
on Saturday. The opening event will
be the men's singles. The idea in
starting on Friday is to finish, if pos
sible, the preliminary round before
Monday. Those who can be present
Friday will be asked to play and the
others will play their matches Satur
day. One challenge match will be
played on September 9. and the other
on September 10.
At the meeting held last Tuesday It
was decided to make all the matches
in the men's events three sets out of
five. If the players who compete at
San Rafael were allowed to vote on the
subject the matches in future would
probably be two sets out of three. This
is not so good a test as three out of
five, but it has many other things in
its favor. It would* save time and
would distress the players less. There
will be some changes next year un
doubtedly. The players will put in
every spare moment before the nets
in order to be in good shape when
play commences.
The tournament commenced at the
park last Sunday will be completed to
morrow and another one will probably
be played during the month. As a rule
tournaments are not held in August.
This is a mistake, as tournament play
is the best possible practice.
Several interesting matches will be
played on the park courts to-morrow.
In the first class. George Baker and
R. N. Whitney will resume their un
finished match. Baker has a lead of
two sets 'to one and needs but one more
to win. Whitney must win both sets
to get the cup. He is playing good
tennis and the remaining set or sets
should prove exciting. If Baker wins,
the cup will go to him for good. He
and MacGavin have each won it twice.
The second class was finished last
Tuesday and resulted in an easy vic
tory for Horace Mann. In the finals
he beat Fred Adams easily. The win
ner should go in the first class, as he
proved too fast for the second.
In the third and fourth classes the
cups are practically new, as no player
figuring in either of them has his name
on the cup. The old fight between
Guerin and Long in the fourth class
will be resumed in the third. They
have reached the semifinal round and
are expected to meet In the finals. In
the number of victories over the other
Guerin leads. Long is a youngster who
is improving rapidly and Guerin will
have no easy time winning the third
class honors. Guerin and Lemon meet
in the upper half of the semi-finals
and T. A. Allan and M. Long In tha
lower half.
The yachtsmen of San Francisco
and the neighborhood will spend to
day and to-morrow in cruising at
pleasure, as no event Is set down on
the programmes of any of the clubs.
The flagship Challenger of the San
Francisco Yacht Club started last
Saturday on the annual cruise up. the
Sacramento River. The launch Rob
Roy has gone up the bay to meet her
and both craft will return to moor
ings at Sausalito to-morrow.
The schooner Challenge returned
last Sunday from an up-river cruise,
which extended as fsr as Freeport.
The yawl Royal and the sloop Sappho
came back from up-river cruises on
the same day, the sloop Ariel having
returned the day before. E. W. New
hall's schooner Virginia has also been
on a trip up the Sacramento.
The annual up-river cruise of the
California Yacht Club began last Sat
urday, the flagship Idler heading a
fleet of about half a dozen boats, in
cluding C. E. Clark's yawl Gypsle and
the sloop Secret. The fleet returns to
morrow.
Next month will be an eventful
one among the yachtsmen. The San
Francisco Club has a clambake at
Paradise Cove and a day Of aquatic
sports. The Corinthians have cruises
to Petaluma drawbridge and up the
Sacramento River on their pro
gramme. The California tars have
cruises to California City and Sheep
Island on their schedule, and the an
nual class flag regatta and Owner's
cup race will be resailed.
The piling for the platform of the
new California Yacht- Clubhouse at
the Emeryville pier is nearly com
pleted. The first pile was driven last
Saturday. When the platform is fin
ished, a gathering of the members will
be held to celebrate the event. There
was a notable remissness on the part
of the California yachtsmen last Sat
urday, which is perhaps partly attrib
utable to the fact that the annual up
river cruise . began on that day. A
large proportion of the work of secur
ing subscriptions, conducting negotia
tions with the railroad companies and
attending to the countless details of
a new enterprise, has fallen on trie
shoulders of Allen M. Clay, who has
been one of the most energetic and
active of yachtsmen. He has not only
worked hard for the California Yacht
Club but also for the Pacific Inter
club Yacht Association and as the rep
resentative of J. M. Macdonough, the
donor of the Macdonough cups. It is
now time that others should take up
his work and carry It on.
The Pacific Interclub Yacht Associa
tion will meet soon ' to organize and
make arrangements for'' the annual re
gatta on Admission day. It was hoped
that another struggle would be seen on
that day between the Challenger an- 1
the Corinthian for first place in the
20-foot class, but it is not likely that
the Corinthian will enter the regatta.
The crew of the Corinthian comprises
so many men who wish to sail their
own yachts that It would be hard to
get it together on Admission day. The
absence of the Corinthian will leave
the first prize in the 30-foot class to
TV. G. Morrow's sloop Challenger, aar
ring accident. It Is expected the en
larged and improved Presto, sailed by
Frank Stone, will be an interesting
feature of the annual races.

The California Coursing Committee's
annual stake will be run at Ingleside
Park on August 13 and 14. The com
mittee is allowed the use of the park
for two days without cost. In order to
make the affair a pronounced success
for the governing body of the sport on
this coast there will be no coursing at
Union Park during the meeting.
The committee in charge consists of
P. M. Clarkson, Teddy Hood and H. A.
Talbot. The big stake will be limited

total prize money will be $1355.

Ten trotters are expected to start in
the two-year-old division of this stake.
They are a high-class 2ot. The record
of the stake, 2:?2 1 / 4, made by Almaden
last year, will be broken. The San
Jose track is in fine shape and fast.
George G,Â° 2:12%, the $15,000 trot
ter, is in the hands of that master
reinsman, Ed Geers, and will start In
the big stakes in which he has been
entered on the Grand Circuit. It was
at first thought hi3 new owner, Mr.
Brady of Albany, N. Y., would reserve
him exclusively for matinee racing,
but now that he has sent the horse to
Geers the public will have an oppor
tunity to see just what the son of
Homeward can do when pitted against
the pick of the Eastern stables.
California horses are winning money
in nearly every race in which they
start on the Grand Circuit. Three Mc-
Kinneys have entered the 2:10 list
since the season opened. That great
sire now has eleven representatives m
that exclusive list. The three new
ones are China Maid, 2:05*4: Nora Mc-
Kinney, 2:09%, and Sweet Marie, 2:10.
Charles A. ; Durfee of * San Jose sold
McKinney two years ago to an Indiana
man. for $25,000 and the present owner
could' doubtless get much more money
for the horse now. No other Â¦ horse
ever had as many 2:10 and 2:15 per
formers at his age and but two or
three of the older sires have as many.
The betting on the harness circuit in
California this year is all on the auc

winner's sire at the time the colt was
bred.
Much interest is being taken in the
56000 Breeders' Futurity toÂ»be decided
at San Jose next week. Six three-year
old trotters have been paid up for this
race and there is a chance that Zom
bro's three-year-old record of 2:13,
made in 1895 and which has not been
equaled in California since, may be
shaded. It is reported that one of the
three-year-olds to start In this race at
San Jose has worked a mile in 2:15 and
another in 2:16, so there is every chance
of a horse race for first money.
Nothing startling in the way of
speed has been shown this week by
the trotters and pacers at Pleasanton,
where the California circuit opened last
Wednesday, but there has been good,
clean racing and a large attendance
even* day. It is expected a big crowd
will be present to-day to witness the
close of the programme. Several of the
2:24 class trotters that start for the
$2000 prize at San Jose one week from
to-day will be given a try-out in the
Livermore stake of J1000, which is
down for decision this afternoon.

The gentle art of fiycasting has
reached Its highest development in this
city, the members of the San Francisco
Flycasting Club holding records which
have never been approached elsewhere.
Twice each month during the season,
which extends from February to Sep
tember, the members meet in competi
tion on Stow Lake, Golden Gate Park.
Some of the members make a specialty
of the delicacy and accuracy event,
which is the nearest approach to actual
fishing on a stream. Others go in for
lure casting, while still another con
tingent makes a specialty of long-dis
tance work. This is the most spectacu
lar event. While in ordinary fishing the
average cast is about thirty-five feet,
H. C. Golcher has an authenticated cast
of 140 feet made in 1902. â¢ Walter D.
Mansfield, who is pronounced the
world's greatest flycaster, sent out 144 !
feet in an exhibition cast in May, 1903.
Mr. Mansfield, with a fine sense of
sportsmanship, leaves the long-distance
event to others, so that his " present
form in that style of competition is a
matter of conjecture.
In this .season's contests J. B. Ken
niff has the best all around record. He
is high man in accuracy, high in long
distance and high in lure casting in the
Saturday contests. His longest cast
this season is 132 feet. This may be ex
ceeded at any time if conditions prove}
favorable. A light west wind is required*;
to carry the line. There ia no weight*
on the end of this, it being tipped with-?;
a tiny hook -from which the barb has.
been removed. \
While the flycasters do not claim that}
their favorite pastime will make a man:
an expert fisherman, they do claim it!
increases his pleasure on the trout
stream Immeasurably, giving him an
insight into the highest development
of the angler's art.*

On the ground near Oak-street sta

be a cricket match between a team
made up and captained by the Rev.
S. H. Winpfield-Digby, chaplain of the
Seamen's Institute. San Fratvcisco, and
an eleven of sailors from vessels lying
la San Antonio estuary. Play will be
gin about 2:30.
The match set down for to-morrow oi
the schedule of the California Cricket
Association Is the return game between
England and all comers on the ground
at Webster street, Alameda. It is al
most certain the match wfll not be
played to-morrow, as no one has under
taken the task of getting the teams
together. The representatives of Old
England are so strong in batting and
bowling that the united Scotchmen,
"Welshmen. Irishmen, Canadians, Aus
tralians and Americans have apparent
ly come to the conclusion that the
all comers' team would stand little
chance. Sides will be picked up among
those present on the ground to-morrow.

RUNS AND HITS BY INNINGS.
Hughes pitched a splendid game. The
San Francisco players seemed to realize
it was useless for them to try to a.sjsuil
the curves of the former Brooklynlte.
Jones got his whenever there were men
on the bases. The score:
At that, they started off badly in the
first inning. Van Haltren beat a bunt
and Mohler drove a long fly out to deep
left field. It seemed Van could walk
home and still beat the ball, but Hilde
brand executed one of the greatest
throws ever seen on the lot and naileU
Van at the plate by three feet. Dele
hanty hit safely, but the next two men
went out, so these three 'good base hits
went for naught.
The Seattle bail team again handed
out the usual potion of defeat to the
home team yesterday at Recreation
Park, making it four without a miss.
When it was made known that Jay
Hughes would unwind his arm no one
expected San Francisco would get a
run. They did get one over, which
saved them from the shame of a white
wash. Score â Seattle 4, San Francis
co 1. i
Seattle played grand baseball, both in
the field and at the bat. Also on the
bases the Si washes were there. They
hit in streaks, and when the clouting
began every man on the team would
follow up the . advantage, so making
four runs was easy for them.

STANDING OF THE CLUBS.
CHICAGO, July 29.â The regular Fri
day steeplechase was the feature of
to-day's piogramme at Hawthorne. It
resulted in an upset by the victory of
Weird at 8 to 1, with Nitrate at 20 to 1,
second, and Sweet Jane, at 5 to 1, third.
Ed Corrigan's good jumper, Creolln,
favorite at 2 to 1, stumbled and fell
after taking the fifth Jump perfectly.
He rolled all over McHugh, but the
jockey escaped injury.
It was or;e of the prettiest struggles
seen ovÂ«r the jumps this season. At
the tenth Jump, five of the field were
In a bunch, but "Weird drew away after
taking this obstacle and In a lonsr,
hard drive won by half a length from
Nitrate.
W. H. Hammond's California filly.
The Mist, was dropped Into a soft spot
in the third race, which was the sec
ondary feature of the card. She sim
ply galloped in front all the way, never
leaving the result in doubt, and fin
ished hard held with a length and a
half to spare. The Mist was always an
odds on favorite, opening at S- to 5 and
closing at 2 to 5. The biggest surprise
of the day came in the first race, which
Harney easily won. The Mist and
Birchbroom were the only winning fa
vorites. Weather cloudy; track fast;

BRIGHTON BEACH, July 29. â That
unlucky race mare, Eugenia Burch,
had a narrow escape from fouling
Rosetint in the fourth race to-day, and
came within an ace of being disquali
ed. Should this have occurred It
would have been the second time this
.year; that her owner would have had
the misfortune of losing a race consid
ered already won. Even as it was
many thought that there was an In
terference, but Hildebrand, who rode
Rosetint, made no claim, and the stew
ards ordered up the red mark confirm
ing the result. This was the only in
cident out of the ordinary of very un
eventful racing, marked by the defeat
of four favorites.
Connoisseurs were gratified at the
conclusion of the flfth and sixth races,
when two popular jockeys. Hildebrand
and Redfern, fought it out on their re
spective mounts. Not often have these
two riders met thfs year. In the fifth
race Hildebrand won by a head on
Brush Up from Redfern's mount, Bill
Bailey II, who came from a long way
behind the winner on the outside. In
the sixth race there was again an
exciting finish, this time Redfern hav
ing the better of it on E. R. Thomas'
tolt Bound Brook, who, after disposing
of Lem Reed after six furlongs, had
to take care of Sir Ship, Hildebrand'a
mount. While .Bound Brook made a
wide turn, keeping on hard footing, Sir
Ship saved ground on the stretch turn
and then began a stern chase after
Bound Brook. Both jockeys rode their
hardest, but Bound Brook managed to
keep his head in front to the end. Ten
lengths, back came Lady - Prudence.

right and left to the head, and in some In

forceful rights to the body and they clinched.
Round One.
Toby Irwin clearly outpointed 'Jack
Cordell in a fifteen-round bout. He
wu.n the harder hitter and Cordell
seemed unable to block the' rights and
lefts which Irwin rained on his head.
CordeH was knocked down in *he
fifth rovuid by a little' pop blow that
caught him on the point of the jaw.
Both came up strongly in the eighth
and neither gave way an inch. Han-
Jon's nose b*?gan to bleed in this round.
It was all slugging again in the ninth,
Hanlon trying his best to stop Nelson.
Nelson c-a.me ur> strongly i^i the elev
enth and wrestled Hanlon about the
ring. The twelfth was all Hanlon's.
In the thirteenth Hanlon staggered
Nelson several times and the beil
mounded just in time to save him. The
fourteenth was Hanlon's round, the
fifteenth Nelson's. It was desperate
Flagging throughout the sixteenth
round. /NTe!?o:i forced the fighting in
the seventeenth and both seemed
tired. ThÂ»? eighteenth marked the be-
r inning of the triumph of Nelson!
Warren Zubrick easily outpointed
Kid William* in a ten-round bout.
Williams lacked both gameness and
condition and was badly cut about the
face. In the third round tfiere was a
fierce mÂ»'x-up. in which Zubrick went
to the mat. He claimed a foul, but
Heferee McDevitt would not allow it.
Zubrick then went in and fought Wil
liams to a standstill.
Hanlon seemed to have Nelson* in dis
tress In the second round, after he had
punished 'him severely about the body.
In the third round he staggered Nelson
with a left to the head and then caught
him going away with a left. In the
fourth round it was all in Hanlon's fa
vor. Toward the end of the fifth Nel
pon improved somewhat. There was a
fast wjndup in the sixth, both men
standing up and slugging. The seventh
vas the first of the sensational rounds.
Nelson was the first to get into action,
scoring often with right and left to the
head. Hanlon came back fighting and
the two boxers eeemed to have staked
their all on a punch. Neither attempt
ed any defense. Both^ just stood and
slugged. Hanlon staggered Nelson with
a right to the jaw and fought him to a
standstill.
Billy Roche made his debut as a ref
eree here. He proved a marked suc
cess. He was close up to the boxers
throughout, and while either had a
hand free he did not try to break them,
but let them fight. He appeared In 1m
macu'ate tuxedo, but shed his upper
jrarments as the-' fight progressed.
Billy Jordan introduced him as the
"gallant Bowery boy." Nelson was
presented as the "Chicago cracker
jack," while Hanlon was cheered when
hf was announced as "the pride of Cal
ifornia." Jimmy Britt and Jack Mun
roe appeared in the ring and made
short speeches. . Â»
the start he seemed to care but little
for Nelson's blows, taking many of
tJiexn in order to give others in return.
Nolson tried often for a right to Han
lon's body and sent home a number of
th^sp blows.
Hanlon was a favorite from the time
the betting bogan. He opened at 10 to
fc and the price gradually went down.
Ten to six were the prevailing odds
when the men entered the ring. Han
lon was the first to enter, being attend
ed by Billy Delaney. Frank McDonald,
Teddy Woirfe and Fred Landers. Nel-
Fon had Teddy Murphy, Frank New
house and Frank Rafael in his corner.

For sixteen out of eighteen rounds
Hanlon held a decided lead over the
Chicago boxer and gave to him an in
credible amount of punishment. There
was never an instant when the two
boxers were not a,t it hammer and
tongs. Nelbon was the receiver general
throughout, but never for an Instant
did he back away from the shifty Cali
fornian. It seemed that flesh and blood
could not withstand the strain, but
round alter round the two boxers
rushed it each other as if there were
no such thing as tired muscles.
It must have been discouraging to
Hanlun to deal the amount of punish
ment he did to his opponent and then
find him round after round coming up
as if nothing had happened. When the
fight reached the eighteenth round
there was a movement among the spec
tators which indicated that they were
sure it would go the full twenty rounds.
Suddenly Hanlon went down, Nelson
thus scoring the first knockdown of the
light.
The Chicago man was the aggressor
in the early part of the round and a*>
they broke out of the clinch he shot
out his right aa he had done many
tJmes before, but this time it con
nected with Hanlon's jaw. Between
the force of the blow and the Jar Han
lon received from the impact with the
floor he seemed dazed. He fell near
his own corner and looked helplessly
toward his seconds. He was up before
the ten seconds' grace allowed by the
Queensberry rules, and then Nelson
ecenting victory in the air, went at him
viciously. Hanlon covered up his jaw
and was able to weather the storm un
til the gong sounded. When the nine
teenth round opened Nelson rushed
ccross the ring and rained blows on
Hsnlon, whose head had not had time
to clear up during the interval of rest.
Some of the spectators, thinking
Hanlon might be injured, were call
ing to the referee to stop the unequal
contest. Captain of Police Anderson
was on his feet and was about to or
der it stopped when Billy Delaney
tossed a towel into the ring, signaling
defeat- The stopping of the fight at
this point will undoubtedly provide
material for wide discussion. Hanlon
unquesiionnbly had ihe better of it for
rixieen rounds and had he been able
to remain on his feet during the last
two rounds the referee would, in ac
cordance with his announced inten
tion, have had to give the decision to
the Californian.
Hanlon showed improved form over
his last appearance in this city. He
M:ij;g-ered Nelson repeatedly, but was
m-ver able to knock the Chicago man
off his feet. Nelson's left 'side turned
n bright red Irom the frequent visita

Round Nineteen.
Round Eighteen.
The pace seamed to have left some effect on
the two men, but nevertheless they contiriu-d
to pummel each other, both doling out much
punishment. Hanlon drovÂ« a right over Nel

Hanlon finally came out of the fray with fly-

and the great crowd was on its feet veliinir
like mad.
Round Sixteen.
Hanlon bored in with rig'.it and left, but
Nelson cilnched. Hanlon Fwung right to the
head and then hooked a left to th<s face, but
the Chicago man did not break ground. Nelson
then varied it by forcing the pace and put in

left to the face. Hanlon almost floored Nelson
with two fearful rights to the jaw, but Nel
son was frame to tne core and fought every
inch of the way. After receiving a terrific

that be did so. for Hanlon Just missed a ter
ritic right for the Jaw. Hanlon drove a fierce
right to the jaw and landed left and right to
the head, but could not floor his man. Hanlon
then landed a risht to th- Jaw with force
enough to knock a bull Â«-nseless, but Nelson
failed to show any signs of distress. It was
all Hanlon'9 round, but Nelson's wonderful
ability to assimilate punishment was not over
looked by the crowd, which cheered him lust
ily for his sameness.

Local dairymen, after protest upon protest and a long

THE CHINESE â C. W. McC, City.
The origin of the Chinese as a nation
is a myatery. The early annals of
China belong rather to mythology
than to history. It i3 held that be
ginning with Pank-Ku. the first of all
beings, the country was ruled over,
first by gods, and then personages de
scended from gods, who revealed to
men the essential arts of life. Of these

history of China from the Tchow
dynasty, which began with Wu Wang,
1100 B. C. It was durint? the reign of
Ling "Wang, 544-571 B. C, one of this

ON Wednesday, August 3, there will be held at
the rooms of the California State Board of Trade
a conference between flour millers, wheat grow
ers and agricultural experts, which will have significant
bearing upon one of the State's greatest industries.
Answering the call of a special committee of the State
Board of Trade, these representatives of the producers
and manufacturers will gather to take counsel upon the
subject of the deficiency in the gluten of California grain
and to seek an efficient remedy for the. same.
Indicating the widespread interest manifested in this
subject by the farmers of the State, The Call has pub
lished within the past two weeks several communica
tions upon the topic from various sections of the grain
growing district. It is becoming manifest that California
is in danger of losing her position among the grain
producing States to either the Dakotas or Kansas un
less there can be instilled into the golden kernels a little
more fatness. We have the grain right enough, more
sturdy, more prolific than that of any other land, but
of late years the complaint has come from the millers
that the falling percentage of gluten in the local product
has diminished its value appreciably. Agricultural ex
perts have it that this lacking admits of remedy, hence
the conference of next Wednesday.
Some of the foremost experts art disposed to follow
the belief of one of our correspondents arid attribute the
falling off in the gluten constituent to the modern meth
ods of harvesting. From field to warehouse in a day is
now the scheme of the combined harvester. The grain
is caught just at the full flush of maturity, cut and sacked
without the intervention of the old style of stacking
and drying. Whether or rot the full quota of gluten is
stored up in this hurriedly harvested wheat is. a matter
to bÂ£ determined by experimental investigation.

ANNOUNCEMENT OF MARRIAGE
â A Reader, Oakland, Cal. The send
ing out of an announcement of a mar
riage to others not immediate rela
tives of the contracting parties is a
custom construed by many as a gentle
hint that a wedding present would not
be rejected. The proper way to an
swer such an announcement is to send
a letter of congratulation, or simply a
card bearing the name of the sender
with the word congratulations writ
ten across the face of it. This depends
upon the degree of intimacy between
the sender and the receiver.
THE miners of the West are moving again for a min
ing officer in the Cabinet â a Department of Mines
with a Secretary at its head. It is doubted whether
Congress will soon move in such a matter. The addi
tion of Cabinet departments is a deliberate process, and
a long time is apt to elapse between events. The Inte
rior Departmnet was created about 1845, and Thomas
Ewing was its first Secretary. No addition was made
to the Cabinet after that until 1889, when a Secretary of
Agriculture was provided and Mr. Coleman of St. Louis
was appointed. Then there was a skip until 1903, when
Mr. Cortelyou became Secretary of the new Department
of Commerce.
We would advise the miners to be mindful of the law
of evolution as applied to the Cabinet departments. The
Interior Department sprouted out of the Patent Office.
The Department of Agriculture sprang from the Bureau
of Agriculture in the Interior Department. The Depart
ment of- Commerce issued from several strong bureaus
that had risen under the auspices of v the treasury. The
miners should go on talking about and urging a Depart
ment of Mines, but they should see to it that a strong
Bureau of Mines is at once attached to the Department
of Commerce. The growth of such a bureau, if it grow,
will demonstrate the need of a department quicker than
all the speeches and petitions on the subject. The West
should organize now for such a bureau.

. President Roosevelt intends to pay the St. Louis Ex

the .diabolism of mischief-makers, may have opportunity
to repeat the dreadful crime that so recently robbed the
nation of its chief magistrate and threw the American
people into gloom.
associations of Christian history, Sir
John Edward Gray Hill and his tal
ented wife possess a mansion, whero
they reside for several months of each
year. It is built in the antique East
ern style, solid and substantial, severe
and austere looking externally, as the
picture of it shows, but within It is
comfortable, roomy and picturesque.
Amid surroundings so remote from
everything that savors of the pursuit |
of wealth it constitutes an ideal re- i
treat for a busy man from the turmc.:l,
cr.res and v.-orries of the workaday
world, for Sir John is one of th # 3
King's new made ' knights who ha*
fairly won his spurs by strenuous la
bor. Ras Abou Kharoub. which means
"he height of the father of Khar
oub trees," is the name of the eleva
t'on on which it is situated. It is th<Â» ,
highest point in the hills about Jeru

and nearly 300 feet above the plat- ;
form of the Haram, or "Noble Sanc
tuary." where the temple once stood
and the dome of the rock and mosque
of- A ska now Stand. The northeast
angle of the walls of Jerusalem point
direct to the house bo that from it the
faces of the south and north walls are
equally open to view. Eastward It
commands a ?uperb view of the
mountains of Moab and the Dead Sen,
that mvsterious salt lake without an
outlet, whose waters are some 1300
feet below those of the Mediterranean,
but almost equally blue and clear.
"The dawn, the sunrise, the sunset.
the after glow, the moonrise, the star
ry night â all are beautiful from this
spot," says Lady Hill, describing^ their
Eastern home, "but loveliest is the
dawn. The first faint flush comes over
the hills of Moab, and .then the sur
face of the Dead Sea shows like ?n 4
â¢rqua marina'; and turning to the
Holy City we can see its domes and
minarets stand out in the cold light,
soon to be irradiated with the first
r.iyg of the sun. To the east stretches
the wilderness of Judea, solemn and
bare; to the west, Jn the spring sea
fon, the young corn and the wild flow
ers and the trees putting forth their
leaves seem to make the desert blos-
Fom as the row."
In his own person Sir John is a fine
illustration of the value of the Holy
Land and the East, viewed merely as
a recreation ground. He is 65 years
old, but erect, clear skinned and over
flowing: with health and vitality he
doesn't look more than 50. He is a
prodigious worker, capable of sixteen
hours' steady grind on a stretch. He
has won his way to the top of his pro
fession, that of a shipping lawyer, and
incidentally has made a lot of money
at it- He is prominently connected
with many maritime and legal asso
ciations and is president of the Law
Society of the United Kingdom, whose
superb new quarters in Chancery
Lane, London, were recently opened
in the presence of King Edward and
a host of notables. But Sir John has
not sought the East year after year
merely to enjoy quiet and seclusion
wilderness; to sit with Father Abraham
under the great tent, and to behold
Isaac and Jacob in their habits as they
lived; to watch the flocks and herds go
forth to feed at dawn and come home
to the protection of the tents by the
light of the setting sun; to camp alone
in solitary fastnesses or upon boundless
piains; to gaze into the starry depths
of a Syrian night; to see the great disk
of the full moon rise across the 'eastern
desert lone* until the splendor of its

On one occasion the desire of Sir John
and his wife "to see something more of
the simple pastoral existence of the
Bedouins" came near costing them
their lives. They fell in with a pack of
those desert rovers who after breaking
bread and eating salt with them vio
lated all the tradition of Arab hospi
tality by making prisoners of them
and demanding a substantial sum of
money for their release. They refused
to believe that a man of Sir John's im
portance and imposing appearance had
not that much with him, and when it
was not forthcoming they drew their
knives and sundry other 'dangerous
weapons and made it clear that so far
as they were concerned it was a case of
backsheesh or blood. But Sir John had
not undergone a lawyer's training for
nothing. He kept a tight grip on his
temper, and incidentally on his re
volver, determined to make, sure of
potting their leader if things came to
the worst, and by exercise of his per
suasive powers succeeded in inducing
them to postpone their murderous de
signs for a few days while he dis
patched a "holy man" to Jerusalem
for the money. During the absence of
his messenger relations were very
much strained between Sir John's little
party and the Bedouins. Among the
latter were some who, fearing that they
would not get any share of the ransom
money, were bent on looting whatever
they could lay thejr hands on, and sev
eral times a shindy was narrowly
averted. But the "holy man" proved
honest as well as devout and returned
in due time with the cash, and Sir John
considered that he and his wife got
rid of the marauders very cheaply for
something less than $1000. They were
bcund for the famed rock city of Petra
when this adventure upset their plans.
Sir John has not repeated the attempt
yet, but he fully expects to reach it
some day, and Lady Hill declares that
she will accompany him.

"In the morning Rattlesnake comes
to his senses just enough to spy the
rock outcropping near his feet, where
a wild bullet had knocked a chip ofen
the quartz. Pete could spot a smell of
ore as far as an eagle can see, and,
half maudlin that he was. Rattlesnake
sees the prospect. It sobered him up
and he goes to work.
"Mind you, now, after two days'
work ol' Rattlesnake strikes a pocket

a small glass cylinder, with a parch

toad, which was also pierced with fifty

lock of woman's hair.
"To all appearances the matter re
solved itself into an old-fashioned
method of witchcraft employed against
the girl whose name appeared on the
envelope.
"A curious point about the affair is
that two days before the discovery waa
made the girls relatives received a let

girl had recently emigrated, stating
that she was on her deathbed.
"Among: them were a heart-shaped
leather cushion, inside which was a

Modern Witchcraft.
FORTY-ONE California pioneers died during the
twelve months ending June 30. 1004. Thirty-nine
of the number were members of the Society of
California Pioneers. On July I, 1904, there were on the
membership roll of the Society of California Pioneers
the' names of 806 persons who are entitled to the honor
of membership. Of these but 426 are original pioneers.
The others are junior members- to the number of 380,
the juniors, therefore, nearly equaling numerically their
seniors. These figures are derived from the annual re
port of the Society of California Pioneers just pub
lished and are entirely reliable. They tell their own
story.
If. the succeeding twelve months shall bring as many
losses by death to the original pioneers,, which it is
hoped may not be the case, the seniors at the end of
the period will have a bare majority of but four. In
two years, at the farthest, the juniors in the society will
outnumber the gray-haired members who helped to
found the State of California. The younger generation
in California, to whom so many benefits have come
through the action of the Pioneers, may well pause a
moment thoughfully at this point to bestow^ the tribute
of gratitude. The Pioneers, gazing not less forward than
backward, may see more clearly every year what great
things are in store and realize the significance of what
they have done.
Included in the annual report of the society are several
statements that are of more than passing interest.
During the ye^r eighteen were made members. There
are seven honorary members, swelling the total mem
bership to 813. President ." >hn J. de Haven reported
that the financial condition of the society is good and
such as to enable it to carry out one of the great pur
poses of its organization â namely, "to give pecuniary
aid to aged and unfortunate member!;, who may be in
need of such assistance." The relief committee in twelve
months expended $10,0.26. The receipts of a year from
all sources were $96,652 65. The expenditures caused a
deficit of $3268 25. Concerning this President de Haven
reported that it was due to temporary loss of revenue
while improvements were in progress, and for the pur
chase of property that will add to the revenue of the
society. The property that has been acquired consists
of two lots on Jessie street for which $16,113 was paid,
and of railway bonds to the amount of $22,035.
Of the members who have 'died within a year three
were between S5 and 90 years of age, thirteen were 80
to 85 years, twenty- two were 60 to 70 3'ears. The
â¢deaths in San Francisco nÂ«jmbered nineteen and in other
cities Â«and towns twenty-one. One died in a foreign
land. William L. Duncan, the marshal of the society,
reported that the deaths were twenty-one less than dur
ing the preceding twelve months. The number of in
valids has also been reduced. There are many suffering
from illness and debility, mostly from age.

It was in 1887 that increasing pros
perity enabled him to take a longer
respite than he had hitherto allowed
himself from the arduous legal work,
and he and his -wife departed from the
beaten track of the Eastern tourist.
"In a month of riding and camping,"
he eays, "we found new health and life,

THE formal notification of the President of his
nomination has occurred under pleasant circum
stances at his private residence. The speech of
Speaker Cannon stated the reasons which actuated the
convention in its work and put forward the time
honored principles and approved policies of the party
by it intrusted to the President for honest application
to the affairs of his country and the interests of the
vrhole people.
The President's reply was ui his best mood. It states
the facts of the political situation so fairly that his
opponents, while confused by the analysis, cannot deny
its truthfulness. Well could he say and truthfully, "We
have made the deed square with the word," for every
pledge of the party has been redeemed, every one of its
principles has been applied and all; of its policies have
been carried out. The results are; before the country.
If the people like those results, if every man feel that
he has had value received for the 2 cents a day taxes
the Federal Government has cost him, let him say .so
next November by continuing in pow'er the party and
the President whose acts have made him content. If
he feel otherwise, let him express himself adversely.
The President said: "We are more fortunate than our
opponents, who now appeal for confidence on the
ground which some express and some seek to have con
fidentially understood, that if triumphant they can be
trusted to prove false to every principle which in the
last eight years they have laid down as vital and to leave
undisturbed those very acts of the administration be
cause of which they ask that the administration itselt
be driven from power." That is severely keen because
it is severely true. No one else has put it in such plain
statement. The President tears off the mask ofj pre
tense and holds the mirror up to nature, so that no
one can deny the truthfulness of the image.
Antithetically he put the position' of his own party:
"We make our appeal in a wholly different spirit. We
are not constrained to keep silent on any vital ques
tion; we are divided on no vital question; our policy
is continuous, and is the same for all sections and locali
ties. There is nothing experimental about the Govern
ment we ask the people to continue in power. Our
opponents either openly or secretly, according to their
several temperaments, now ask the people to trust their
present promises in consideration of the fact that they
intend to treat all their past promises as null and void.
But we know our own minds, and have kept of the
same mind long enough to give our policy coherence
and sanity." That is a magnificent appeal to honesty
an<fr common sense, and again it puts the lancet into
the vitals of the opposition.
Continuing he said: "We have placed the finances of
the nation upon a sound gold basis. We have done this
with the aid of many who w.ere formerly our oppo
nents, but who would neither openly support nor silently
acquiesce in the heresy of unsound finance; and we have
done it against the continued and .violent opposition of
the mass of our present opponents who still refuse to
recant the unsound opinions which for the moment they
think it inexpedient to assert. We know what we mean
when we speak of a sound and stable currency. We
mean the same thing from year to year. We do not
have to avoid a definite and conclusive committal on the
most important issue which has recently been before
the people, and which at any time in the near future
may be before them again. So long as the Republican
party is in power the gold standard is settled, not as
a matter of temporary political expediency, not because
of shifting conditions in the production of gold in cer
tain mining centers, but in what we regard as the
fundamental principles of national morality and wis
dom."
The address then covers the trust and labor prob
lems, all frankly and fearlessly, and the domestic and
external issues of interest to the people. Its clarity of
statement is remarkable. Every man who reads it com
prehends every word and has only to appeal to the
history of his country to verify it all. The President
has not found it necessary to sit inside of himself and
juggle in the shadows. It is all in open day, all easy
of comprehension, and appeals with matchless power to
his countrymen's sense of fair play.
Judge Parker sees in it a hewing to the line. When
he takes his broadax in hand let us see where his chips
fly.

on the liner, accompanied by his wife
and baby.
F. P. Stone, president of the Ban
croft-Whitney Company of this city,
is another passenger on the Mongo
lia. He is accompanied by Mrs. Stone
and goes as far as Hongkong on the
liner.
The passengers include the following:
The Pacific Mail Company's liner
Mongolia. Captain W. P. S. Porter,
loaded deep with valuable merchan
dise and crov/ded with passengers,
sailed yesterday for Honolulu and the
Orient. She will make Honolulu on
schedule time, but the date of her ar
rival anywhere else depends upon the
naval situation in the Far liast.
Her cargo is valued at $454,182. The
freight for Japan is valued at $23S,326,
and includes several items that a prize
court might consider contraband of
war. Among the Japanese cargo is a
consignment of v\g leadâ 973.15S pounds
of it. It may be intended for plumbing
purposes, but could be used in the man
ufacture of bullets. There are also 1728
bundles cf steel, 500 cases of alcohol.
846 bundles of leather. 1456 bales of cot
ton and 113,000 pounds of soda ash.
The Mongolia has thirty-two cabin
passengers for Honolulu and 105 for
ports beyond. She also carries 150 Chi
nese. Among the latter is a slave girl
who escaped from her Chinatown owner
a few days apo and Is now on her way
back to the Floweiy Kingdom.
Among the Manila passengers the
navy is represented by Commander
Asher C. Baker, Lieutenant Command
er Howard Gage, Captain John P. Mer
rell and Lieutenant Frank L. Pinney.

Notice to Passengers.
The schooner Bessie K, which left here
Thursday for Ean Vicente landing, returned
to port yesterday morning on account of the
breaking down of her gasoline engine. She
was about four miles below the Cliff House
when the engine refused to choo-choo. As there
was no wind. Captain Stark sent some of the
crew ashore, to notify the owners and a tug
was sent to bring the disabled vessel back to
port.
Itutunis for Repairs.
Premier Combes, when questioned
after, the Ministers adjourned, declared
that diplomatic etiquette forbade him
to speak. This statement Is interpret
ed to Indicate a complete rupture of
diplomatic relations with the Holy
See.
The French Government's note was
telegraphed this evening to M. de
Courcel, the secretary in charge of the
French embassy to the Vatican, who
will communicate It to the Vatican
authorities to-morrow.
It is believed that the embassy staff
will leave Rome to-morrow and that
the Papal Nuncio will leave Paris.
PARIS, July 29.â The Vatican's reply
to the French note demanding the re
call of the letters ' summoning the
Bishops of Dijon and Laval to Rome
was received at the Foreign Office this
morning. It consisted of two notes,
dealing separately with the cases of
the two Bishops.
The Council of Ministers, after sit
ting until 5 p. m., discussing the Vati
can situation, decided to keep its de
cision secret.
Corn exports for the week aggregate
4 35.S44 bushels, against 706,64 7 last
week, ?2S,629 a year ago, 28,415 in 1902
and r^n.COl in 1501. From July 1 to
date the exports of corn aggregate
r,31?,'. 5.".
Other lines of industry are rather
quiet, iron notably so, pending a
clearer view of future requirements.
Business failures in the United States
for the \seek ending July 28 number
174, against 100 last week. J90 in the
like week in 1503, 16S in 1902, 160 in 1901
and 170 In 1000.
In Canada failures for the Â¦week
number IT, as against 19 last week and
IT in this week a year ago.
Wheat, including flour, exports for
the week ending July Â£S aggregate
3,613.^65 bushels, against 1,281,501 last
week, 2,191.4*2 this week last year,
4,218.534 in 1902 and 6,4G2,C?1 in 1901.
From July 1 to date the exports ag
gregate o.lSS.174 bushels, against 12,006,.
624 last year. 16.54D.S40 in 1902 and 23,
67*316 in 1S0I.
Advices from some Western markets
point to more doing in fall dry goods,
shoes and clothing. Good crop prospects
favorably influence Southern trade,
v. hich Is expected to prove excellent
later on.
Trade at Eastern markets is still
rather quiet. Wool is quiet though still
firm, with medium grades relatively in
1Â» st demand.
On the Pacific Coast Fan Francisco
r r ;iorts a light trade at present, but a
jruod fall business is expected. Export
business is affected by war complica
tions. The salmon pack will be disap
pointingly small on the Pacific Coast.
The meat strike has reopened at lead
ing Western packing centers, and there
is danger of sympathetic strikes em
broiling: railroad employes. In addi
tion to the 26,000 meat trade strikers,
production of print cloths at Fall River
has come to an almost complete stop
owing to the strike of 25,000 mill hands
against a reduction. In addition to
these troubles, the dullness in anthra
cite coal and the overstocked condition
of all markets render serious existing
disputes between operators and miners.
A j-'enf-ral shutdown of ail mines is
t-xpected to occur next week, involving
the idleness of Â£0,000 men.
Brad.~i.reet'* to-morrow will say: More
i. tlvity is noted at a few 'Western cen
ters, but full trade is slow to assume
form pending assurance as to crop re
sults and the- settlement of existing in
dustrial disturbances. Crop conditions
are on the whole favorable, though ir
i<.grularity in sections prevents generali
zation: Shipments of goods are livening
u;< at the West and are expected to be
cme active early in August. The move
rr.ont of winter wheat to market, some
what delayed this year, has begun in
earnest. Coincident improvement in col
lections is shown at some centers, and
th*> demand for money from the coun
try has increased. The movement of
currency to move the crops has as-
Furaed good proportions this week.
NKW YORK, July 29.â Duns review
of trade to-niormw win pay: Confidence
ejrpears to be returning, despite a large
sedition to the army of unemployed.
Labor disturbances are the most unfa
vorable factors In the industrial and
Â«."m?nercia] situation at the present
time, curtailing the output of a few
in u< h- needed products and reducing the
demand for all commodities. Aside from
this adverse influence the situation has
improved, although progress is slow
and frequently interrupted. Another
%v(-ok has put" much wheat and cotton
beyond danger and brought other crops
rearer maturity. Dealers ar^ providing
for '.I?- future .1 little more freely, and
in <"\eral important branches of indus
try orders com* forward in greater
bulk. Owing: lo special conditions the
K-adirg: branches of manufacture do
not make uniform progress, complica
tions to supplies of raw material
n:ak:ng the current situation particu
larly puzzling at the textile mills and
e!ioÂ« shops.
The t-i.rr.inss of the railways thus far
refined for July are only 2.7 per cent
less than last year.
While the tone of the packer hide
market is naturally very strong owing
t'i the parking-house strike, there is no
activity, tanners tailing: to perceive
any &dvp.nt&ge in making purchases
*a hen deliveries are so uncertain. For
eign hid^s arrive slowly and are in
brisk request.
Failures this week numbered 220 in
the United States, against 190 last year,
and 15 in Canada, compared with 19 a
><-ar ago.

The Second Congressional District!
Republican Convention will meet at
Santa Cruz August 25. The apportion
ment of delegates to this convention
will be as follows: Butte 11. Colusa ;
3, Glenn 3, Lake 3, Marin 8. Mendoclno j
11, Napa 10, Sacramento 22, Sonoma 20,
Sutter 4, Yolo 7, Yuba 6; total 103 dele
gates. .
It Is foreshadowed that Duncan E.
McKinlay of Sonoma, one of the ablest
exponents of Republican doctrine In |
the State, will receive the nomination
for Congress and lead the party to vic
tory in the district. It would not sur
prise the politicians If the district
gives Roosevelt and Fairbanks 5000 ma- i
Jority, and it Is expected that McKinlay \
will keep up close to the head of the |
ticket. Many legislative measures of
vital Importance to this progressive dis- |
trict will come before Congress and I
something can be accomplished by a !
Republican Representative, but a Dem
ocratTc Congressman can only object. '
The Modesto Herald asks why the I
choice for United States Senator should !
be limited to Southern California aspl- j
rants. The party leaders understand >
that the Republican sentiment throuch- !
out the State is favorable to a recog
nition of the fact that the southern !
counties give the majorities which hold Â¦
California in the Republican column. '
For example, In the gubernatorial elec- !
tion of 1902 the counties of Los An- i
geles, Orange. Riverside. San Bernar- '
dino, ,San Diego, Santa Barbara and !
Ventura gave Pardee a majority of :
11,153 over Lane. Furthermore, one of
,the United States Senators is a resi- â¢
dent of Alameda County and the Gov- }
ernor resides in the same county. The I
Lieutenant Governor lives in Solano.
the Secretary of State in San Fran- ;
Cisco, the Controller In Sonoma, .the At
torney General in Plumas and the Su
perintendent of Public Instruction in
Fresno. I
The honor of presiding at the Re
publican Stute Convention, called to
meet at Bunta Cruz Thursday, August
25, will probably be accorded to Robert
T. Devlin of Sacramento. The impres
sion prevails that R. N. Buila of Los
Angeles will be placed at the head of
the electoral ticket. The convention
will nominate ten Presidential Electors.
E. B. Edson of Sisklyou is mentioned
among the acceptable. J. O. Hayes of
Santa Clara; E. C. Voorheis. Amador;
Frank Short. Fresno; W. R. Guy. San
Diego; S. M. Shortridge, San Francisco;
A. G. Burnett, Santa^Rosa; Guy C.
Earl, Alameda; Orestes Orr. Ventura,
and A. J. Buckles, Solano. are spoken
of.
When Tompkins got home he missed
the watches and shoes. A neighbor told
him he had seen a girl climbing
through the window and leaving a few
minutes later, carrying a bundle. She
described the girl and Tompkins knew
at once it was Miss Frame. He had
passed her on Howard street on his
way home. He notified Policeman
Krueger, who found the girl at Sixth
and Howard streets. She was taken
to the Southern police station and ad
mitted stealing the watches, which she
had pawned foe. $5. She gave Tomp
kins the pawn tickets, and he became
generous and said he would not prose
cute her. She was warned and set free.
When Mrs. Tompkins got home she
missed her two rings. This angered
Tompkins. and he determined to prose
cute the girl. He made a complaint to
the police on Thursday morning, and
Detectives Regan and O'Connell have
been detailed on the case. They have
been unable to find the accused and be
lieve she has left the city.
. Regan and O'Connell say that Miss
Frame and Miss Blanche Blackwell are
one and the same person. Miss Black
well's age is 19, but she looks three
years younger. She was arrested on
June 20 on complaint of Mrs. Clara
Cllve on a charge of petty lar
ceny. Mrs. Cllve became acquaint
ed with Miss Blackwell, who
claimed to be a professional acrobat,
and invited her to call. Miss Blackwell
called, and after she left Mrs. Cllve
missed her purse. An hour later she
met Miss Blackwell on the street with
the purse in her hand.
Mrs. Minnie Klock, 812 Larkin street,
also charged Miss Blackwell with petty
larceny. Miss Blackwell was introduced
to Miss Klock, who had an ambition to
become an actress. Miss Blackwell was
invited to call at the Klock home. She
did so. and after she left $28 was miss
ing from a bureau drawer. The cases
were called in Police Judge Conlan's
court, but were dismissed on July 23,
as the two aggrieved ladies took pity
upon the defendant and refused to
prosecute her.
The police are searching for Lizzie
Frame, 16 years of age, and if they find
her she will be charged with burglary.
George Tompkins. 36 Woodward ave
nue, is her. accuser. The girl had be
come acquainted* with the Tompkins
family. While the family was absent
on Wednesday" afternoon the house
was entered through a rear window.
It had been thoroughly ransacked and
two watches, two rings and a pair of
shoes were stolen. >.->

WHEAT â The foreign markets showed no
marked change. Argentine cables reported the
weather favorable and the export demand good.
Broomhall estimates the European crop at
1,688,000,000 bushels, against 1.856.000,000
bushels In 1903. Asia, 416,000.000 bushels,
against 352.000.000 bushels the year previous.
Chicago was higher and the market as
well as that at St. Louis was flooded with
report of damage by rust and smut in the
Northwest. The Northwest backed up these
damage reports with large- orders to buy.
The private wires of Mitchell. Mulcahy &
Co. from Chicago said: "The market took lta
tone mainly from the Northwest advices. There
were rains in that quarter, with more pre
dicted, and there were also Increasing com
plaints of damage to spring Wheat from rust
and smut. These were somewhat vague as to
the extent of territory covered, but they camÂ©
from good people and the Northwest led the
advance and was a good buyer In this market.
These complaints have been coming in more or
less for some days, but the point is that they
were to-day more emphatic and numerous. The
market broadened somewhat on the speculative
buying which resulted- Cash markets are
generally quiet. The July option Is still a
disturbing factor and obscures the legitimate
cash situation.' The Modern Miller was bull
ish on the threshing: returns and the poor
quality of the winter Wheat."
In this market the cash grain and futures
were both firm, with the latter higher. There
was an active business In futures and the
millers were reported buying heavily in the
Sacramento Valley.

The fruit market was heavily supplied with
most kindj ot email tree fruits and was d?
cidedly weak for general offerings. Fine ship
ping Plums were scarce and in demand for ex
port to northern ports at 7S*i90c per crate,
but the market was overloaded with soft and
otherwise poor fruit, which dragged badly at
40<g50c pÂ«r crate. There was a good export
demand for other fruits, but supplies were
too heavy to permit any advance in prices.
Peaches were a glut on the market and It
was difficult to obtain over 50c per box for
anything but tha fanciest shipping stock.
Apricots were in Increased supply and neglect

prices having checked the demand. The bulk
of the receipts went to the csnnera at the
quotations, and some poor lots could be bought
for less. Pears were steady at about previous
prices, with the canners purchasing freely at
the quotatlcns. The casners were also In thÂ«
market for Peaches and secured quite a quan

more liberal offerings and Cantaloupes . and
Nutmeg Melons were abundant and weak.

sweetness and tha top rates were obtained only
for small parcels of selected shipping stock.

CHICAGO, July 29. â Damage reports from
the spring wheat, country were, perhaps, the.
most Influential factor in causing a strong
wheat market here to-day. At the close Sep
tember wheat was up 1%@1%c. Corn and
oats each gained }4c and provisions 7%o
to 15c.
Sentiment In the wheat pit was decidedly
bullish at the start as a result of an attempt
on the part of shorts to cover July sales. The
cause of the urgent demand was a report that
a large quantity of wheat in private elevators
which shorts had expected to deliver on July
contracts had been rejected by the inspection
department. This necessitated bidding for
grain In the pit. There was little for sale and
in consequence tha price was forced over l%o
above yesterday's closing quotations. The ac
tion of the July option gave support to the
distant deliveries. September opening at a gain
of %c to %c at S9%c to 89%c. Toward the
end of the first hour the market eased off
somewhat on profit takinc, September being
down to SS'gSOSe. The reaction, however,
was short lived. Alarm over the European
political situation, allayed early in the day by
a rise in English Consols, was stirred up
afresh by a subsequent sharp decline in tho.se
securities. About the ea.ne time damage re
ports from the Southwest and Northwest be
gan coming in, causing additional anxiety
among shorts. A report that Northwest coun
try mills can take all the new wheat offered
from now on caused a renewed buylnx. An
official forecast of thunderstorms Increased
the bullish tone, as did also numerous advices
from Kansas City, claiming- a decrease in re
ceipts at that point. On the bulge that fol
lowed September advanced to 90Hc. but part
of the. gain was again lost on realizing. The
market, however, closed strong with September
at 90Ue90^c.
Strength of wheat was the main factor af
fectlne the corn market, although there was
some purchasing for long account late in the
session on rumors of a possible European war.
The market closed near the high point of the
day. September opened unchanged to %c
hltther at 498i4?49%c. sold between 49Uc and
49*Cf49%c, and closed at 49%c.

The receipts of Butter continue heavier
than ever before known, but the consumption
must have correspondingly increased, for the
market seems to absorb them. There are in
dications of an impending change in the mar
ket, for some dealers who have hitherto been
very weak have turned firm and are quoting a
steadier market, especially for the finer cream
ery brands. Others, however, who are- still
carrying excessive stocks, find the market as
depressed as ever and are seeking buyers. The
demand for interior points is very fair, as
usual at this time of the year.
Cheeoe continues in large supplr and quiet
at previous prices.

NEW YORK BONDS.
wa s not free from damagw reports, and these
had some natural effect on stocks. There was
some early response to the downward tendency,
which centered chiefly in St. Paul, that stock
rising at one time a large fraction over last
night. United States Steel preferred yielded
early to the selling pressure on continued dis.
cussion of the quarterly report. Other news
bearing on that etock was the reported shut
ting down of mills for an indefinite period at
Lorain for lack of orders and a reported cut
in tinrlate prices. Union Pacific seemed to
suffer s ome ill effects from the declaration of
only the regular dividend on the stock, al
though it has not appeared that any serious
expectation was entertained of an Increase.
The labor situation is the subject -of some
anxious consideration in speculative circles.
This anxiety was Increased to-day by the pro
jected conferences among anthracite mine lead
ers to consider an extensive strike against
grievances. A larre reduction of the working
force was said to be in progress by one of
the great car construction companies. The
passing of quarterly dividends by some of the
New England cotton mills kept in sight the
unpromising condition in that department of
industry. A small bank failure in Wisconsin.
following two other failures at different points
earlier in the week, renewed the unpleasant
impression of that condition- which has been
dominant for several weeks. Sub-treasury
operations have yielded less to the banks than
for some time past and to-day a payment of
a Central Pacific note to the Government for
nearly $3,000,000 resulted in a credit balance
for the sub-treasury at the clearing-house of
over $1,700,000. The better showing for the
Government revenues which reduces the banks'
imnWiate gains reduces any probability of
the withdrawal of Government deposits from
the banks to replenish the Government's work
in* balance. Currency has continued to ar
rive in large volume from the interior and a
gain in caÂ«h of upward of f3.000.000 is fore
shadowed by the estimates. The market closed
steady, but without effective recovery.

passage an ordinance providing for the

the power in the hands of the Board of
Supervisors. The proposition to give the
Supervisors general supervision of con
tracts for all departments in the city
government was seriously discussed,
but it was concluded that such a course
would be inadvisable for various rea
sons. The fact that the Fire Commis
sioners have awarded the contract for

Is now being done by the city at a less
cost, caused the committee to take the

Horace Philbrook filed a complaint

of Seattle against Edwin W. Newhall
to recover $50,000 damages alleged to
have been sustained by reason of the
seizure of Wadleigh's four children by

January 23, 1903.
Wa.dleigh'8 childrenâ May, aged 15
years; John, aged 13 years; Sarah,
aged 11 years, and Solomon, aged
eight years â were taken from their
parents on the date mentioned by vir

Edwin W. Newhall was president of

secretary. The complaint character
izes the proceedings in the Superior
Court as "a travesty upon justice"

Albert Gallatin, the Sacramento
capitalist, will not have to pay
$10,000 to his daughter, Grace, the
wife of Ernest Seton Thompson, fam
ous as a writer of animal stories. The
case of daughter against father has
been pending for some time and yes
terday a written opinion was handed
down by Superior Judge .Sloss, in
which it was held that the father was
under no legal obligations to fulfill an
agreement made with his wife, Nemie
Gallatin, when they were divorced on
June 21, 1SS1. Under the agreement
Mrs. Gallatin was to have the custody
of the daughter, Grace, now wife of
the author, and was to pay for her
support and education. Gallatin,
however, agreed to pay $66.66 a month
toward the child's support and fur
thermore said that when she reached
the- age of 18 years he would give her
$10,000.
The monthly payments were con
tinued for a long time and were even
tually reduced from 566.65 a month
to 5600 a year. The 510,000 was never
paid, although Grace Gallatin reached
the age of IS in 1890. After she mar
ried the author she first hinted to tier
father that the money would be wel
come, then she became insistent and
finally told him she would go to the
-pourts for her rights.
f These facts were set forth in the
affidavit of Gallatin In the trial of the
case and he included the interesting
correspondence between himself and
daughter. She sent him a copy of
Thompson's book, "Wild Animals I
Have Met," and referred to the volume
in all of her epistles.
Judge Sloss made no comment on the
documentary evidence of the wife's de
light in her husband's works nor upon
the couple's poverty in spite of their
literary success. The Judge coldly
weighed the legal proposition and held
that there was no consideration for
Gallatin in the agreement with his
divorced wife and that in awarding
her the custody oÂ£ the. child the mother
was obljgated under the law to main-,
tain her. The child herself was not a
party to the litigation for divorce and.
therefore, could not sue for benefits
growing out of the agreement.

Mrs. Sarah Curtis left her Jessie
street residence one day about a fort
night ago and went to the dwelling of
Mrs. Emma Fitzgerald, 110 Minna
street, where she deliberately smashed
four panes of glass and was arrested
for malicious mischief. When the case
came up before Police Judge Conlan
there was evident reluctance on the
part of all concerned to say any more
than was absolutely necessary of the
causes that led to Mrs. Curtis' act of
vandalism and in response to her dec
laration of intention to pay $1 50, the
amount of material damage sustained
by Mrs. Fitzgerald, the case was dis
missed.
A sequel to the foregoing case" de
veloped one of the liveliest incidents in
the history of department No. 2. Mrs.
Curtis was again a defendant and
Mrs. Fitzgerald again her accuser and
the charge was sending threatening
and obscene letters. It appeared that
instead of paying the $1 50 to Mrs.
Fitzgerald, as she had promised to do,
Mrs. Curtis wrote upon pieces of wrap
ping paper and with a lead pencil a
number of badly-spelled missives and
sent them to Mrs. Fitzgerald, the tenor
of the messages thus conveyed being
too filthy for publication. Suffice it
that Mrs. Curtis chirographically ac
cused Mrs. Fitzgerald of alienating: the
affections of Mr. Curtis from his law
ful consort and that the writer pro
posed to retaliate by weaning Mr.
Fitzgerald's love from the lady who
bore his name. The letters were pro
duced in evidence and while Judge
Conlan was examining them Mr. Cur
tis, who sat among the attorneys, hotly
averred that his wife was not their
author and that they were forgeries,
written with malicious intent to bring
trouble and disgrace upon her and
him. At the request of the complain
ant's counsel the Judge handed the let
ters to him and Mr. Curtis suddenly
grabbed at them. In an instant â¢ the
lawyer and Mr. Cxj-tls were "mixed"
and an instant later Mr.- Curtis was
helpless as an infant in the herculean
grasp of Bailiff Laws. The Judge is
sued a bench warrant for Mr. Curtis'
arrest and the case of the woman was
continued till next Monday, when her
husband will probably also pose as de
fendant on trial.
Judge Cabaniss relieved the conges

After dismissing a number of opium

Cabaniss heard the larceny charge
against John Schmitt, specifically ac

had no recollection of purloining the
coal oil, as he was intoxicated at the
time, nor did he attempt to prove in
nocence. Indeed, he was rather inclined
to accept the prosecuting testimony as
true in every detail, because he knew
that anything in liquid form had an ir
resistible attraction for him while he
was drunk and athlrst. He would not

Not a Legal Obligation
Mike Moran was fined $10 for beating
Bill McCarthy on the head with a pav
ing implement, after the provocation
for the battes^ had been fully explained
to Judge Fritz. In his eagerness to
obtain a Job as laborer for the Street
Department, It was stated, Mr. Mc-
Carthy ingratiatingly notified a certain
foreman that some of his employes,
Mike Moran among them, were in the
habit of "soldiering" while at work by
surreptitiously smoking and chatting
and doing several other things prohib
ited by the rules of the department. It
was to punish an informer that Mike
applied the paving implement to Bill's
skull. Bill, it may not be amiss to add,
is still seeking a job.
Judge Conlan resolutely declined to
reduce the $4000 ball under which S. J.
Keyes is held to answer a charge of
threatening to kill his wife, am': his
Honor's decision was probably prompt
ed by the demeanor of theflefendant
himself as he sat among the prisoners
in the cage. Mrs. Keyes and her son
and daughter were in court, and as
Keyes glared at them balefully his
arms twitched and his hands involun
tarily clinched. "This defendant is
evidently too dangerous a man to be
allowed at large," said the Judge, "and
for that reason I refuse the applica
tion for reduction of his ball."

ney. Judge Fritz represented the peo
ple in the battery case against Angelo
Lagnoncelli, and ho vigorously did h!s
Honor question the defendant that At
torney Shortall, for the defense, filled
the atmosphere with objections, all of
which the court referred to Itself and
then overruled. "When 'the examination
was concluded^ Mr. Shortall ingenu
ously asked Â£he Judge if he desired to
address himself In behalf of the prose
cution, and the Judge not only de
clined to do so, but startled the defense
by dismissing the case.
Both the broom and the bouquet were
lost in the shuffle occasioned by Otto's
lesistance of arrest.
Otto Artell, a tall and muscular na
tive of Sweden, established his
young bride in a flat which he had fur
nished for her on Valencia street, and
among the necessary housekeep
ing implements which he forgot
to purchase was a broom. So
on Thursday evening he went forth
and bought a dust-raiser, and at the
same time procured a bouquet of pinks
as a token of his love for Mrs. Artell.
Alas! neither the broom nor the bou
quet ever reached the hands of the
waiting lady.
On his return trip Otto met two com
patriots and accepted their congratu
latory offerings of beer until he forgot
he was married, and then he suddenly
became possessed of great love of his
fatherland and corresponding contempt
for every other nation, not excluding
the United State?; While thus fired by
patriotic ardor her tied the bouquet to
the tip of the broom handle and should
ering the stick as if it were a rifle he
sallied forth and pairaded Market street
between Sixth and Seventh, loudly pro
claiming his desire to meet and anni
hilate a Native Son of the Golden West.
That was how he got into the clutches
of Patrolman Dolan, and that was why
Judge Conlan sentenced him to thirty
days in jail.
"Well, I might as well give you the
money, anyway," said Ellen, "for it's of
no use to me, because you coppers and
Judges won't let me _stay out of Jail
long enough to visit the bank. I'll send
you a check to-morrow morning, and
I hope you'll cash it right away, for
glad I'll be when I'm rid of the respon
sibility of having a bank account."
Miss Kelly then whispered to Bailiff
Conlan that she'd like to borrow 5 cents
from him wherewith to purchase cigar
ettes.
Ellen Kelly's seventh semi-annual
appearance as a defendant accused of
drunkenness was made before Judge
Fritz, who haughtily spurned her offer
to exchange $30,000 for immediate resto
ration to personal freedom. Then he
sentenced her to six months' imprison
ment.

SLOSS WEITES OPINION
James Price, in his elevator, was on
the third floor, and feeling the smoke
and flame coming up the shaft below
him took his car hurriedly to the sixth
floor. He knew the building was on
fire and the rooms were filled with
people, many asleep. He stopped at
every floor and called loudly the alarm.
In a little room under the roof on the
norjn side of the house was Jonas W.
Attell, an old man, and, in addition to
this infirmity, a cripple. He* had late
ly procured a pair of cork legs, and,
being unaccustomed to their use, was
helpless. Price was determined on his
rescue, and rushed into the apartment.
The room was empty, and when he
started to return- to his elevator he
found his retreat was cut oft ' by the
flames that had followed him up the
sjiaft. Try as he might, there was ab
solutely no escape. The fire seemed
to fill the narrow stairway and the
hall, and he was driven back into the
room. He climbed out of the window,
sat on the eight-inch stone ledge and
waited.
Thus caught on his errand of heroic
effort to save life and facing his own
death from a hundred-foot fall on to
a roof below. Price remained cool and

The fire broke out at about 8:43
a. m. in the bottom of the elevator
shaft, which extends to the basement
This apartment, a mere cellar, is^ oc
cupied by the Peerless Awning 'and
Tent Company. It is believed that the
crossing r>Â£ electric wires in the bot
tom of the shaft caused the fire, as
M. Llpman, the foreman of the fac
tory, and Miss Florence Stanley, who
were in the little office adjoining the
shaft, state that they were startled
by seeing flames suddenly burst out
from that place. They escaped into the
street. The flames then had a clear run
up the chimney of a shaft. At the
Bixth story they found an outlet and
played havoc in the hallways and
among the rooms on that floor.
An exhibition of heroism was seen at
the fire in the Lynmvpod House. 18 Ma
son street, yesterday morning. James
Price, an elevator man, burned and al
most suffocated, was rescued from a
window ledge on the sixth floor. His
rescuers were three firemen and two
electricians. When they reached him
the flames were scorching his hands.
He could not have held his perilous po
sition .much longer.
